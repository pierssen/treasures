<h2 class="center">MAYWEED BLOSSOMS.</h2>

<div class="center" id="b01">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>WHAT MAYWEED SAID.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="drop">W</span>HEN the sunlight bursts forth in its brightness,
or the rainbow arches the clouds,
my soul leaps with gladness, and I think,
"Who so happy as I? Who so much
cause for rejoicing?" But when the clouds
return after the rain, and the chilling winds
cause my sensitive spirit to shrink within itself, I feel
like exclaiming, "O, ye that pass by, turn and see if
there is any sorrow like unto my sorrow!"</p>

<p class="prose">It was upon such a time as this that I wandered forth
and sat me down upon a friendly log, by the side of
which grew the homely Mayweed. "Just like my entire
life," said I, as I looked upon its familiar face;
"unattractive without and bitter within; no sweetness,
no beauty, covered with dust, and trampled under foot
in the highway." But as I thus pondered, a busy bee
paused in its onward flight to salute the humble weed,

<!-- page 12 -->

while a voice, that seemed to issue therefrom, said,
"Were there no sweetness the bee would not tarry in its
flight, and as for the beauty, wait." Surprise changed
the current of my thoughts, and forgetting my sorrow,
I listened intently for more, and lo! I was taken back
to the very morning of my childhood.</p>

<p class="prose">The simple weed seemed possessed of clairvoyance,
for it told me of the time when I had pressed its kindred
beneath my little feet, as I made my way for the first
time to the portico of a-b-c-dom, and there was no
sorrow in the recollection. Ah, the very spirit of Mayweed!
I could fancy it to have stepped forth from the
form, and to be leading my spirit over the pathway of
that life of which I had spoken so bitterly. Back and
forth we went over the devious windings of that summer
at school. "See here," said my guide; "do you remember
this creek, by the side of which you used to play,
bringing moss from the woods to carpet the sand, the
floor of the play-house, and to make a bed for dolly,
decking the whole with the scarlet berries that grew
beneath the pines?" Just here came the thought of the
day I played in that same creek till the teacher had to
wrap me in her shawl while she dried my clothes.
Well, I suppose it was not quite so pleasant in the time
of it, but I question if the delight of paddling in the
liquid crystal did not fully compensate for the annoyance
of the wise sayings of, "See what little girls get
by being naughty," etc., etc. If not, I am sure that
the laughs I have had since, in reference thereto, have
more than made up the deficiency. No, there was no
sorrow in the recollection of those years. What cared
I for poverty? The trees and the flowers were as beautiful

<!-- page 13 -->

to me as to the richest; the broad earth was as
green, and the blue heavens as bright; and then, in
my grandfather's home, where I was privileged to stay
through that, my four-year-old summer,&mdash;a very unpretending
dwelling by the way, but to me wonderful,&mdash;within
was comfort, and without the glorious old
pear trees, the big sweet apple tree that almost tossed
its fruit into our bedroom window, with the plums, and
the cherries, the walnuts that grew in the fields, and the
chestnuts in the woods. What a world of treasure
stored away in the chambers of Memory, to be enjoyed
even yet! "Is it not so?" said Mayweed; and my
spirit could but reply in the affirmative; and yet, with
a kind of perversity which is perhaps peculiar to me, I
look some two years ahead to a scene in that same
home, where I find myself in tears. Tears for what?
Why, you see, "Little girls must be industrious," and
I was learning to knit; but the glad shouts of uncles
not much older than myself, and of cousins also, have
tempted me from my task, and here I am in the midst
of them, my hair streaming in the wind, and as merry
as the merriest; but a voice that I dare not disobey
summons me back to my little chair and my knitting
needles with, "Ain't you ashamed to be out there with
the boys?" and so I weep, but not much; for that only
brings additional reproof to the eldest granddaughter,
of whom they are somewhat proud, and would like to
manufacture into the article known as "Lady."</p>

<p class="prose">A little thorn this, but I cannot forget the pain quite
so quickly as I did the other, for it was a real robbery
of my rights, and my heart goes out in sympathy to the
thousands who have been robbed in like manner.</p>

<!-- page 14 -->

<p class="prose">Mayweed, however, is again at hand, and she gently
leads me back to the school-room. "Do you recollect,"
she says, "when you read of the lazy sheep who ate
'grass, and daisies white,' how you wondered what the
white daisy was? There was a golden-colored, buttery-leafed
flower, which you had named yellow daisy, but
nothing that had ever fallen under your eye that filled
your idea of what a white daisy should be; and yet you
might be mistaken, and, wandering in a by-path by yourself,
when recess came, you gathered some of the fairest
of the Mayweeds among my ancestors, and tried to make
yourself believe that they were the flowers intended."</p>

<p class="prose">While Mayweed was thus reminding me of the ancient
examination, I plucked, and began, unconsciously,
to examine a blossom from the one before me, when a
voice by my side&mdash;a real human voice&mdash;said, "You
think that is homely, auntie; but just look through
this, and then see;" presenting me, at the same time, a
magnifying glass of moderate power.</p>

<p class="prose">"Well, Charley, this does change the appearance
somewhat," said I; "but it is not very beautiful yet."</p>

<p class="prose">He regarded me a moment with an amused look, and
then handed me one of much higher power. I adjusted
it to the humble weed, and what a transformation!
Glorious beyond all I had ever imagined, the very dust
upon its leaves sparkling like diamonds. "Beautiful!
beautiful!" I exclaimed, in rapt astonishment, when
there came a soft whisper, "No beauty, no sweetness.
Is thy life like the Mayweed's?" "Would to God it
might be!" was the full response of my heart. "The
lens of thy spirit is the glass through which thou must
look upon it," came in sweet reply. "As it expands

<!-- page 15 -->

thou wilt find the bitter bringing sweetness&mdash;the unattractive
changing to attractive&mdash;then beautiful, then
dazzlingly glorious&mdash;brighter and still brighter, as the
jewels polished by the rough hand of Time reflect the
blaze of Eternity." I listened till the voice ceased, and
then went forth content.</p>

<div class="center" id="b02">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>FAINT NOT.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">Faint</span> not, soul, beneath thy sorrow;
Long the night that brings no morrow;
Woo thou Hope, and she will sing,
While she folds her fluttering wing,
Soothing strains, to cheer thy way,
Till night brings the new-born day.</p>

<p class="stanza">Courage, courage, struggle on:
If a cloud obscures thy sun,
Dream not that thy joys are past;
Of thy faith 'tis but a test:
Courage, and it soon shall be
A crowning gem in victory.</p>

<p>FLOWERS THAT BLOOM BESIDE THE
WATERS.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">Flowers</span> that bloom beside the waters,
        Murmuring waters,
Coming from the hidden fountains
        Of the heart,&mdash;
    Fathomless fountains
That, with joy or sorrow moved,
    Give the tints those flowers are showing,
    All the hues in which they're glowing,
        As a mirror
    Giveth back an image true.</p>

<p class="stanza">Flowers that bloom beside the waters,
        Gushing waters,
    That with life instinctive swelling,
    Upward welling, ever welling,
Out in rivulets are flowing,
On the banks of which are growing,
        In varied hues,
        Those blooming flowers&mdash;
Flowers, and buds, whose bursting fragrance
    Floateth heavenward,
Floateth through the upper air
    Till the angels bend to breathe it,
        Bend to breathe it,
        And return it,
Sweetening thus our every care.</p>

<!-- page 17 -->

<p class="stanza">Flowers that bloom beside the waters,
        Laughing waters,
        Leaping upward,
Like a full-toned shout of joy,
When the soul takes in the gladness,
        Draughts of gladness,
That through Nature's wide domains
Flows, as floweth through our veins
        The living tide;
Leaping up, then backward falling
        To the earth,
For the flowerets that are calling
        Know their worth;
Know, they to those liquid crystals
        Owe their birth.</p>

<p class="stanza">Flowers that bloom beside the waters,
        Bitter waters,
Where the wormwood of affliction
        Hath been cast,
Till with shrinking we have shivered
As they to our lips were pressed;
Waters where the fragrant rose
Blooms, then sinks to its repose
    With the thorns all turned within,
Drawing from life's vital fount
        Its crimson hues.</p>

<p class="stanza">Flowers that bloom beside the waters,
All along the path of life;
Born of grief, or born of gladness,&mdash;
Born, where rippling o'er its bed
<!-- page 18 -->        'Tis so shallow,
        That each pebble
Gives an eddying whirl,
And the sunlight makes it sparkle,
        Till 'tis fairer
E'en than they, the flowers.</p>

<p class="stanza">Born where in their quiet flow
Silently the waters go,
Hiding all their depths;
Or where, winding through the shade
Where the cares of life have hid
        The light of heaven
In that shadow of the tomb,
Growing up without perfume,
Fading almost ere they bloom,
        An ashen hue is given.</p>

<p class="stanza">Born where life becomes a cascade,
Leaping from some rocky wall,&mdash;
Leaping till its shivered atoms
        Weave the sunlight
        Into rainbows,
While the foaming and the dashing
Tend to quiet flow again,&mdash;
Even here they will be blooming,
For they're sown beside all waters,
        Germs of flowers,
        By angel hands.
Germs of flowers that bloom to wither,&mdash;
Here on earth flowers will wither,
        But their fruits,
<!-- page 19 -->If protected, they shall ripen
In a fairer world than this&mdash;
Ripen for the hands that sowed them,
Ripen for the hearts that nourished.
        Both shall share
        The harvest bliss.</p>

<p>THE FLOWERS OF LIFE.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">The</span> burning sun of noon was o'er me;
Along journey lay before me;
I looked around on all the plain
For shelter, but I sought in vain.
Just then I saw, far down the way,
A flower of colors bright and gay:
I ran in haste to gather it,
Unmindful of the noontide heat.</p>

<p class="stanza">And then another and another
Drew me still further on and further,&mdash;
Ah, yes, they even drew me on
Until my journey was quite done;
Then, as I turned to seek for rest,
Thinking how much I had been blest,
'Twas thus I mused: "What should we do
But for life's flowers, as we pass through?"</p>

<p>HEART LEAVES.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">Heart leaves, as ye turn them o'er,
    Ye that are called sages,
Can ye read the mystic lore
    Traced upon their pages?</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">O, the</span> heart! the heart! What a strange, complicated
piece of workmanship! The human heart,&mdash;the
seat of feeling and affection, of all the various
emotions which go to make so large a share of the happiness
or misery of the individual! Heart leaves: turn
them over; read them till their number shall exceed the
leaves of the forest; but do not imagine, even then,
that thy task is accomplished, for new ones continue to
present themselves, each varying from the other, and
stretching on, onward, till the years of eternity are numbered.
Only to the eye of the Infinite are they spread
out in one ever-present panorama.</p>

<p class="prose">As the lights and shades&mdash;the rough and smooth
places, and all that, taken separately, would look like
unmeaning distortions&mdash;are needed to make the work
of the artist perfect, to make a picture that shall proclaim
a master's hand, so is each leaf in that wondrous
book called "The Heart" needed to form a perfect volume.
But here there are no stereotyped editions&mdash;no
ten thousands struck from the same type. No; each
book is a new work, complete in itself&mdash;original and
distinct from all others.</p>

<p class="prose">You may do them up in the same covers, give them
the same title, and try to pass them off for copies of the

<!-- page 21 -->

same work, but it will not do; sooner or later you will
discover that God declares his infinity in all his works,
and that variety is the natural language of that infinity.
Cease then, poor foolish mortal, to measure the capabilities
of another by thine own. Think not, when thou
hast deciphered a portion of what is written upon some
page of thine own heart, that thou hast obtained so
much of an insight into the multitudes of hearts around.
thee; for none but the "dear God" can fathom the life
springs of humanity, and he only can touch the chords
to which their deep pulsations vibrate.</p>

<p>PLEASURE.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">Long</span> time I sought for Pleasure;
    At length to me she came,
And with her a companion,&mdash;
    The people call her Pain.
She quickly introduced me
    To this unwelcome one,
And then as quickly left me,
    But, O, she went alone!</p>

<!-- page 22 -->

<div class="center" id="b07">

<p>"WE'VE GOT A GARDEN!"</p>

</div>

<p class="prose">"<span class="smcap">O, Miss</span>, we've got a garden! come and see our
garden!" said a little, slender, blue-eyed child, in one
of those dwellings so common in cities&mdash;those which
are so closely huddled together that there seems hardly
room left for a breath of air to intervene. I wondered
where room could be found for a garden in that crowded
place. I followed the child, however, and she led me
to the back part of the building, then pointing to a window
over the sink, she bade me look out, and there, on
about a yard of ground, I saw a few green sprouts of
some kind, the seeds of which had been accidentally
scattered, and had taken root in that uncongenial place.
Never shall I forget the sickening feeling which came
over me as I looked at those pale, sickly plants, and
then into the eyes of that equally delicate child, as they
danced for joy, while she continued repeating, "See!
we've got a garden! haven't we got a garden?" It was
Nature's own voice, speaking in language not to be misunderstood,
asserting her right to the love of her children.
And then to think that this feeling must be
warped, twisted out of shape by the force of surrounding
circumstances, and perhaps entirely crushed from
the heart of that trusting one ere womanhood was
attained, was indeed sad. How often since then have
I thought of that child, and wondered what has been
her fate; and how often, as I have seen large plats of
ground running to waste for want of cultivation, have I
thought how differently they would look, if the owners
loved their gardens as she loved hers!</p>

<p>COUNTING THE STARS.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">You</span> ask me what I'm thinking of,
    And willingly I'll tell,
For 'tis of other scenes on which
    Fond memory loves to dwell.
I'm thinking of a cottage fair
    That stood among the hills,
Where I sported in my childhood,
    Amid the sparkling rills.</p>

<p class="stanza">I'm thinking of a grassy plot
    Before that cottage door,
Where carelessly I laid me down
    One night, in times of yore,&mdash;
Yes, carelessly I laid me down,
    Unmindful of the dew
That fell like sympathizing tears
    From yonder arch of blue.</p>

<p class="stanza">I looked upon yon milky path,
    Which seemeth to me now
Like a wreath of silvery roses
    Upon Creation's brow,
And thought it was a fleecy cloud
    That stretched across the way,
And cast its shadow on the path
    Of the departing day.</p>

<p class="stanza">I looked upon Night's radiant gems,
    And with my childish eye,
<!-- page 24 -->I tried to trace my alphabet
    Upon that page so high;
I counted clusters one by one,
    The great ones and the small,
Until at last I thought that I
    Would try and count them all.</p>

<p class="stanza">Ah, little did I think
    That the angels hovering o'er me
Were greater in their number
    Than the stars that shone above me!
Ah, little did I think
    That those orbs, so wondrous fair,
Were to me but a symbol,
    My angel name a star!</p>

<p>PLEASANT FLOWERS.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">When</span> I was twelve years of age, my father rented a
house and lot of Esquire C&mdash;&mdash;, in the town of D&mdash;&mdash;.
His daughter had her bed for flowers, and of course I
must have one, so I selected a spot, and filled it with the
choicest seeds and roots that I could obtain. Two
years passed. They grew and flourished, yielding their
share of beauty to gladden our hearts, and then we
changed our residence. The following spring I visited
my friend, and with her the spot which had once been
my home. How changed! The house was full of machinery
instead of happy children. The garden fence
was thrown down, and what had once been so carefully
tended was exposed to the invasion of anything that
chose to enter. I surveyed the scene in silence, but
passing round the house, a vision of beauty met my eye
which chased away my sadness. There were some of
my flowers in full bloom, bending their heads gracefully
to the morning breeze in spite of the surrounding ruin.
And can we not thus plant flowers in the moral, as
well as in the natural world, such as will bloom in the
midst of desolation? What though we move from place
to place, is it any the less our duty to scatter sunshine
as we go?</p>

<p>THE TWO HOMES.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">Long</span> years have elapsed since I gazed on those homes
    So dear to my heart when a child;
Where plants of affection sent forth their perfumes,
    And grandparents looked on and smiled.
They who dwelt in those homes were equally kind,
    I cannot tell which I loved best;
Then why in my dreams do I still always find
    That but one is the place of my rest?</p>

<p class="stanza">Why is it I pause but a moment at one,
    Then hasten to pluck the bluebell
Which grew o'er the river? or yet farther on
    I seek the wild grape of the dell?
Then off to the hills where the blueberry grows,
    Or on the brookside the wild plum?
'Tis thus when my body has sunk to repose
    I wander away from that home.</p>

<p class="stanza">But when to the other, on wings of delight
    I speed me, full long is my stay;
In the orchard and garden I revel all night,
    Nor leave till the breaking of day.
O, this is the cord, the secret that bound
    My heart like a charm to the spot&mdash;
Here flowers and fruits in abundance were found,
    While they at the other were not.</p>

<p>THE USE OF THE BEAUTIFUL.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose">"<span class="smcap">It</span> is very pretty, but I don't know as it is of much
use to soul or body either."</p>

<p class="prose">The above remark was made in my hearing, not long
since, by a lady who has lived more than sixty years in
this beautiful world, upon being shown a nice piece of
worsted embroidery. "It is very pretty, but I don't
know as it is of much use to soul or body either."</p>

<p class="prose">And what is your idea of use? thought I, as I looked
into her time-worn face. Is it that a thing is of no
value, unless it will bring money or its equivalent?</p>

<p class="prose">God must have made a strange mistake in preparing
a home for man, if money is the <i>sine qua non</i> of all
that is desirable; if a beautiful thing is of no use because
we can neither eat, wear, or sell it, which latter
we could never do if there were none to appreciate it.
If, then, it is of no use because it cannot be appreciated
in any of these ways, why did God send forth the spirit
of beauty to pervade, like the breath of life, all created
things?</p>

<p class="prose">Beautiful, and yet of no use! O, woman, thy gray
hairs should make thee venerable; but has the lapse of
years so shrivelled up thy soul that thou canst feel no
joy in looking upon that which is lovely? Does the
song of birds, the delicately tinted flower, the stately
tree,</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"With quivering bliss of thousand leaves,
Kissed by the wooing summer breeze,"</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">the gorgeous sunset clouds, the shining stars, or blush

<!-- page 28 -->

of early morn, never awaken emotions of gladness, and
cause thy spirit to thrill with unutterable bliss?</p>

<p class="prose">Canst thou see nought in fields of waving grain,
flocks of bleating sheep, droves of lowing kine, but the
shining dollar? Canst thou look upon the abundance
of luscious fruit, or listen to the hum of bees, and think
of nothing but the gratification of the palate? Then,
indeed, art thou miserably poor. Though thy possessions
should reach from the rising of the sun to the setting
thereof, the veriest beggar, whose heart is open to
the charms of nature, is richer than thou, and may say,
in the language of the poet,</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Cleon hath his million acres,
    Not a penny I,
Yet the poorer of the twain
    Is Cleon, and not I."</p>

</div>

<p class="prose">If that mother has spent all the years of her life thus,
if she has brought up her ten children to see no value
in aught but money, the world could well have spared
her for all the good she has ever done it.</p>

<p class="prose">She may be called an energetic woman; but of what
use has that energy been, if it has only moulded the
hearts of her children into stone, by making them insensible
to all the softer influences of life, thus crushing
out the better part of their natures? If, under her influence,
her sons and daughters barter their best affections
for gold or position, what is gained by such energy?
Are families made happy, is society better, does
the blessing of the poor follow in its footsteps?</p>

<p class="prose">"God is love, and they who dwell in love dwell in
God;" 'tis true, also, that he is an energetic power, and

<!-- page 29 -->

that energy, which trains souls without the love of God
as seen in his works, is training them for a harvest of
sorrow.</p>

<p class="prose">Suppose those children yield themselves to such an
influence, become moulded and fashioned with one absorbing
idea, money, what happiness can their companions
or children find in their society? And even if
their love of possession should be restrained sufficiently
to keep their hands off the property of another, what
benefit will they ever be to neighbors or friends?</p>

<p class="prose">But suppose, when they come to act for themselves,
that they should break away from the unnatural restraints
of their childhood, and seek, in the gratification of their
appetites or passions, compensation for the higher and
nobler enjoyments of which they have been deprived,
what then? Why, we shall have the drunkard, the glutton,
or the heartless libertine.</p>

<p class="prose">O, mother, what a sad mistake you made when you
thought that the love of the beautiful was of no use to
soul or body either! This love is implanted in the heart
of all, it is a want of our nature, and throughout the
works of Nature we find provision made to meet this
want; but if this provision is left unappropriated, this
part of ourselves uncultivated, the restless longings of
our souls will find vent somewhere, and streams turned
from their course are apt to do mischief.</p>

<p class="prose">If parents only felt, and taught their children to feel,
that "a thing of beauty is a joy forever," what different
looking homes should we see all over the land! Neatness
would take the place of filth, and beauty of deformity.
We should not see pigsties and barnyards in such
close proximity to our dwellings, neither would those

<!-- page 30 -->

dwellings be exposed to the scorching rays of the summer
sun or the driving blasts of winter because each
cooling, protecting shade had been destroyed; and their
walls would not be lined, as they now often are, with
store advertisements, or other coarse pictures.</p>

<p class="prose">How my heart ached to see rooms that were daily
frequented by bright-eyed, beauty-loving cherubs, disfigured
by the portrait of some public dancer, dressed
in almost any conceivable style but a modest one; or
perhaps a rude sketch of some bloody battle, placed in
a conspicuous view.</p>

<p class="prose">Do such parents ever stop to think of the power of
association, or do they not care? Do they not know
that our characters are, in a great measure, formed by
what is continually presented for our admiration? and if
they admire such things enough to give them a place in
that sacred spot called home, will not their children think
them valuable, and the scenes they represent worthy of
being imitated?</p>

<p class="prose">Very young children will, if properly taught, soon
see the difference between the beautiful and the comical
or ludicrous. I was once spending a few months in a
family where this part of the soul was well cultivated.
One day Charley brought in a comic picture that he
had found somewhere, and gave it to his little sister,
but little more than three years old. She looked at it a
moment, then commenced laughing heartily. "Is it
pretty, Fanny?" said her mother. "It's funny," she
replied. It was not pretty, but funny; it excited her
mirth, but not her admiration. Very correctly answered;
but how had this young child learned so soon
to select the proper language for expressing the difference?

<!-- page 31 -->

Go to the play-room where she spent hours each
day with her brothers and sisters. Look at the papers
and magazines that were appropriated to their use, and
from which every beautiful picture was carefully selected
and arranged, while the funny ones were laughed at and
thrown aside, and you will have an answer.</p>

<p class="prose">Children love pictures, but this love is liable to be
perverted. If we take no pains to place before them
images of the beautiful and true, the image of that
which is deformed and untrue will form its counterpart
in their minds, and go to help make up their characters.
But it is not only children that love pictures&mdash;the passion
is universal, or so nearly so, that of him who does
not, it may be said, as of him who has no music in his
soul, he</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"Is fit for treason, stratagems, and death."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Then why should this part of our souls be so neglected?
"Better be earning something to support herself, than
spending her time making pictures," said a stern backwoodsman
of his sister, who was gratifying her love
of nature by trying to imitate its beauties. But who
support themselves best? Let those who know them
both answer. And go ask that sister if she regrets
the time thus spent because it has brought her no golden
returns, and she will tell you that money could never
purchase such pure pleasure as she has derived from
thence.</p>

<p class="prose">No; believe me reader, let your walls be adorned by
pictures of your own make, or the works of others,
that you have learned to appreciate by discipline in that
direction, and their presence will create a charm from

<!-- page 32 -->

which you would not willingly break away; a something
without which your life would seem incomplete.</p>

<p class="prose">How many young men, who now frequent the saloon
or gambler's hell, would never have been seen there if
pains had been taken to make their homes attractive, by
gratifying this innate part of their nature. And why
should those who have taken it upon them to lure souls
to ruin, understand this so much better than they to
whom God has intrusted the business of training them
aright?</p>

<p class="prose">"O," says the poor man, "I have to work to get a
living for my family. I have no time to whitewash,
paint, plant trees, or train vines. I have no money to
buy pictures, or to pay out to have my children taught
to make them." But you may find time to have an aching
heart when they flee from your comfortless home,
to seek at Destruction's mouth the gratification of those
tastes for which you have neglected to provide.</p>

<p class="prose">"Where there's a will, there's a way." If you could
but see the value of such things, you would find time
and money too, even if you did without your tobacco,
or something else equally useless, if not pernicious.</p>

<p class="prose">"But," says one, "what has all this to do with worsted
embroidery?"</p>

<p class="prose">Nothing, only it forms a part in the chain of the
beautiful, the ornamental, which go to make up so
much of the enjoyment of life; and they who would
repudiate it, because "it does no good to soul or body
either," would repudiate a thousand other things for
the same reason, without which life would not be very
desirable.</p>

<p class="prose">Recreation we must have; it is a necessity of our

<!-- page 33 -->

existence; even the toiling captive proves this by songs
that lead the unthinking to believe him happy; and
what more innocent recreation can we find than trying
to imitate God in his works?</p>

<p class="prose">"But," says another, "would you have a woman neglect
her household affairs to embroider or paint?"</p>

<p class="prose">Never. I would have her see that these are kept in
the best of order, but I would have her taught so to
arrange them, as not to make a drudge of herself; and
I would have her husband, brothers, and sons remember
that she needs relaxation as well as they; and I would
have them all feel that whatever tends to increase their
happiness, whatever adds to the attractions of home,
and makes the thought of it a pleasant thing, is good
for soul and body both.</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">Dear</span> sister, I'm thinking, to-night, of the place
    Where, sporting in childhood's bright day,
With hearts on which sorrow had left not a trace,
    We carolled the glad hours away.</p>

<p class="stanza">I think of the spring, and the streamlet which ran
    In its gay laughing beauty along,
Of the flowers that bent o'er it, their beauty to scan,
    Or list to its murmuring song.</p>

<p class="stanza">The banks where the hazel and June-berry grew,
    The log which we used as a bridge
For crossing the stream, which smiled from below,
    Or struggled in impotent rage.</p>

<p class="stanza">I think of the aspen, so ready to tell
    When the soft summer zephyr flew by,
The oak in the corner, whose acorn-cups fell
    From boughs that seemed up in the sky.</p>

<p class="stanza">I think of the vine, whose tendrils alone
    Supported its clustering weight&mdash;
The hoary old rock, whose particles shone
    Like jewels reflecting the light.</p>

<p class="stanza">I think how we hastened with eager delight
    To greet the old pasture-field slide,
When Winter came down with his garments of white,
    The bosom of Nature to hide.</p>

<!-- page 35 -->

<p class="stanza">But years, as I think, keep coming between,
    With lessons of wisdom and truth;
As things that recede, in the distance are seen,
    So now are the days of our youth.</p>

<p class="stanza">The river of Time, as onward it rolls,
    Forbids us our steps to retrace,
While change after change sweeps over our souls,
    As if all the past to efface.</p>

<p class="stanza">But change, though it often comes christened in tears,
    Is proving itself but a friend;
Each tint in life's picture the plainer appears,
    The nearer we come to life's end.</p>

<p class="stanza">We know that the beautiful blossoms of spring
    Must fade ere the fruit we can taste;
And life's many changes were given to bring
    Earth's weary ones home to their rest.</p>

<p>DISCOURAGED.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">Discouraged</span>, ah! Discouraged, are you? Well, I
do not know that I can give you better advice than father
used to give me when I complained of being tired.
He used to say that I must put tired to tired, and at it
again; and I suppose you will have to do the same with
your discouragements. Poor consolation, do you say?
I know that it is, but I can give you no better; and I
am not sure that it is so poor after all. What could I
say that would be more to the purpose? You don't
know? Neither do I; if I did, I would say it. Of
what use is it for you to keep struggling, do you ask?
Of what use will it be for you to stop? Tell me that?
Why, you can die, at least. I deny it: you cannot
die. You may pass out from your present habitation,
but you cannot die; and if you pass thence before the
work that has been assigned you is accomplished, what
then? God knows, and the future will reveal it; I
cannot.</p>

<p class="prose">It is easy to talk, say you, but to what does it amount?
I know it is, my friend, and if talking would dispel
clouds, would scatter gloom, what a bright world we
should have! how quickly the slightest mist of sorrow

<div class="quote">

</div>

<p class="prose">Bah! Poets should know better than to sing such
stuff. They should soar above the earth-bound fogs

<!-- page 37 -->

and mists that envelop common mortals; they should
become so etherealized as to feel no weight of care
while hymning the praise of cheerfulness; and instead
of battling with despair, when faith and hope are the
themes of their inspiration, they should frighten the
monster to death with one of their gifted smiles. Hunger

<p>LIGHT IN DARKNESS.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">From</span> off the couch of darkness,
    Where morning bade them rest,
Arose Night's frowning shadows,
    And hastened to the west,
To quench the sunset glories
    That lingered on their way,
As if they would assure us
    Of a returning day.</p>

<p class="stanza">I stood and watched their progress,
    Stood 'neath the falling dew,
And saw Night draw her curtains,
    Curtains of sable hue,
Before the scenes of nature,
    That were my heart's delight,
And thought it was an emblem
    Of my own spirit's blight.</p>

<p class="stanza">Then, as the past came looming
    Before my tear-dimmed eye,
Still darker grew the shadows
        Across my mental sky,&mdash;
Grew darker still; in anguish,
    I turned to seek relief,
By weaving into song-wail
    A record of my grief.</p>

<p class="stanza">But as I wrote, a something
    Seemed saying in my ear,
<!-- page 39 -->"Why should you thus be helping

That you should add the burden

<p class="stanza">"O, cease to ponder only
    Upon each cloudy day,
And think how much of sunshine
    Has lighted up your way!
When God his love discloses
    In thousand varied forms,
Will you receive the roses,
    And scatter only thorns?"</p>

<p class="stanza">"O, what to me is sunshine?"
    My wayward heart replied,
"That into night has faded,
    Or roses that have died?
What cares the weary traveller
    That there has been a day,
When through the thickening shadows
He gropes, to find his way?"</p>

<p class="stanza">And then I turned me sadly
    Again upon the night,
To gaze, as on an emblem
    Of my own spirit's blight,
When, lo! where I had fancied
    A brow of ebon hue,
<!-- page 40 -->Ten thousand gems are gleaming
From yonder concave blue.</p>

<p class="stanza">Were gleaming, softly gleaming,
    And with their gentle light,
They pierced the thickest darkness

<p>THE MISTAKEN VINE.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there stood, upon the banks of a
marshy stream, a young and thrifty vine. The time
had come when she could no longer sustain the accumulated
weight of her own growth, and the question
arose as to where she should seek for the needed support.
Upon the left, close upon the borders of the
marsh, was an abundance of shrubs and weeds, some
of but a year's growth, and some of longer standing;
on the right, and but a few rods distant, stood a stately
oak.</p>

<p class="prose">The oak looked kindly down upon the youthful vine,
and said, "Come to me; your graceful foliage shall be
a wreath of beauty about my rugged trunk, while I lift
you high above the earth, into heaven's broad sunlight;
you shall rest securely upon my branches, and together
will we listen to the notes of the aerial songsters that
come to refresh themselves from your pendent clusters."</p>

<p class="prose">But the inhabitants of the marsh said, "Nay, why
should you leave your friends for a stranger? Some of
us rejoiced at your birth, and others have since come to
admire your beauty; we all love you, and why should
we be separated? To be sure, we are small as yet,
but, like you, we are in the morning of life, and while
the oak, that has seen so many years, is going to decay,
we shall be flourishing in the vigor of our prime.
Come, then, let us grow together, and cement the
friendship so happily begun."</p>

<p class="prose">The vine, thus harangued, looked thoughtfully from

<!-- page 42 -->

one to the other, and thus communed within herself:
"I should like to sit, like a queen, upon yonder oak;
but I do not like the idea of crawling on the ground to
reach it, and then to climb so far, with nothing but that
rough, rugged trunk to twine about: the very thought
of it is shocking. But then, to unite myself with those
low bushes would be quite too bad. I ought not to
think of it for a moment, and yet they are really growing
very fast. Who knows but they may become as
high as the oak in the time it would take me to crawl
thither and climb to its branches, and by continuing
with them, I shall thus save myself all this humiliation
and toil."</p>

<p class="prose">Delighted with this pleasing conclusion, the vine
reached forth her tendrils, and clasping them around
her professed friends, agreed to cast in her lot with
theirs. Time passed on; the broad-leaved luxuriance
of the thrifty vine nearly hid her supporters from sight;
only here and there a sprout, more vigorous than the
rest, or requiring less room, found its way upward.
Autumn came, and the heavy clusters bowed the frail
reeds nearly to the earth. Mutual recriminations took
place. The vine complained that, instead of being sustained,
as she had a right to expect, her fruits were
constantly in danger of being destroyed by the four
footed beasts that went that way. And the bushes said,
"It is all your own fault; you hide from us the light of
heaven, leaving us to pine for its vivifying influence,
and then load us with a burden intolerable to be borne."</p>

<p class="prose">But their murmurings were of short duration; for a
thirsty herd of lowing kine came thither in search of
water, and together they were trampled into the mire,

<!-- page 43 -->

the beautiful clusters being crushed beneath the broad
hoofs.</p>

<p class="prose">In the mean time the son of the thrifty farmer complained 
that they had not land enough, and wished his
father to purchase more. "But why should we do this,"
replied the thoughtful sire, "when much that we now
have remains uncultivated? The bed of yonder stream
can be straightened and deepened, thus making acres
that are now useless not only tillable, but of a superior
quality?"</p>

<p class="prose">The marsh was accordingly cleared; its shrubs and
brakes, together with the vine, gathered into heaps and
burned. But while they were exterminated, the roots
of the vine remained, and life was strong within. Again
she sent forth her branches, and again she bent beneath
her own weight; but having learned that "humility is
before promotion," and "a haughty spirit before a fall,"
she bowed herself humbly to the earth, and, regardless
of the invitations of others, made her way towards
the oak; patiently she ascended the rugged trunk, till
at last she sat like a "Crown of Glory," a "Diadem of
Beauty," upon the topmost boughs.</p>

now art; the rosy cheeks, and rosebud lips that I kissed
so passionately, were those of long, long ago. Even
when thy brothers and sisters, proud of the beauty of
the youngest darling of the household, took turns in
placing thee against the wall, and then stepped back
for thee to come tottling, falling into their arms, amid
shrieks of childish laughter, while our mother sat watching
us with the fond loving pride of her maternal heart.
Sweet sister, never shall I forget when I first took
thee from our mother's arms, a dewdrop from the skies,
the breath of heaven fresh upon thy velvet cheek. Ah,
thou wert a very rosebud, the last of our domestic summer!
For the frosts of death came all too soon, and
the parent stem withered beneath its touch. Then they
took the pillow from thy head, even thy mother's bosom,
and thee from us; then we were scattered like leaves
of autumn before the breath of poverty.</p>

<p class="prose">Yes, we were scattered, and now I see thee only in
dreams, but never will the sweet prattling of thine infant

mingle with those of the great Infinite Heart over

The rain, the crystal drops that come
In myriads from their airy home,
That they may aid in giving birth
To all that springeth from the earth.</p>

<p class="stanza">There's many a glittering gem that shines
    Upon earth's bosom fair,
And deeply hid within her mines

These clusters on each lovely flower,
Left by the welcome summer shower?</p>

<p class="stanza">O, beautiful the robe which spring
    Flings o'er this world of ours,
And bright-eyed summer comes to bring

And autumn, from his garner, yields
Abundance to the wide-spread fields;
But fruitful fields we seek in vain,
Or robe, or flowers, without the rain.</p>

    His light from out the skies,
And flowerets from their lowly beds,

And every shrub and plant that grows,
Hastens its beauty to disclose;
But brighter still will they look up
With rain drops in each tiny cup.</p>

<p class="stanza">Then let it come, the gladsome rain,
    To beautify the earth;
Yes, let it come, again, again,
    For who can tell its worth!

To fructify this world of ours,
Remember that our hearts will prove
Barren without thy showers of love.</p>

<p>MY GOD, MY HEAVEN, MY ALL.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">I was</span> walking along the streets one pleasant morning,
when I saw an awkward-looking, coarsely-dressed
boy crossing the Common at a little distance. He was
singing. At first I could not distinguish the words, but
my involuntary thought was "some vulgar rhyme, no
doubt." I had been particularly grieved that morning
by the naughty conduct of one who was dear to me,
and my feelings were running in rather a sad channel,

<!-- page 49 -->

and I followed out those feelings by proceeding to
mourn over the evil effects of such coarse and often
deeply impure rhyming, when the words "My God, my
heaven, my all," fell distinctly on my ear.
He had paused, and was looking down into a pond
of water which stood in the centre of the Common, but
he continued his singing, and seemed to dwell almost
unconsciously on the words, "My God, my heaven, my
all."</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"So I but safely reach my home,
My God, my heaven, my all."</p>

</div>

<p class="prose">I had heard them hundreds of times, but never did
they sound half so sweetly as now. Those few words
from that poor ignorant child&mdash;that undeveloped image
of the Deity&mdash;were to me like the song of an angel,
or like the voice of the great Father speaking through
mortal lips, saying, "Fear not, for I am with thee; be
not dismayed, for I am thy God." Yes, he was my
God, my heaven, and my all.</p>

<p class="prose">I had started to my day's labor, looking within upon
my own sad thoughts, instead of without where the sunlight
lay, like the smile of love over all the force of
nature; but the words that I had heard touched a new
chord in my heart, and it thrilled to the hidden harmonies
within&mdash;harmonies which gushed forth to meet
the spirit of gladness that was abroad in the earth. I
now felt that I could walk and not be weary, could run
and not faint, in the path that was marked out for me;
yea, as though I could mount up as on the wings
of eagles, to meet that God who was "my God, my
heaven, my all," and not only mine, but of every suffering
son and daughter of earth.</p>

<p>MARRIAGE AND GENIUS.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">Somebody</span> says that "all women, whatever their attainments,
have a yearning desire to love and be loved
again; that the head cannot be educated at the expense
of the heart, and that if they cannot obtain such as they
can most venerate and respect, they unite themselves
to such as tender them the love they have the need of:
they dream of happiness, and awake to disappointment."
. . . "Not alone are <i>women</i> of genius thus unhappy;
<i>men</i> suffer too, from ill-assorted marriages."</p>

<p class="prose">"Men suffer, too!" Well, why shouldn't they? Are
they so complete in themselves that they can do without
love? Are they a whole, and we only a part, that must
be attached to them, ere we can survive? Have they
no hearts, no longings for affection? Woman may suffer,&mdash;I
sometimes think she is made for suffering,&mdash;but
deliver me from the anguish of a truly noble-hearted

<!-- page 52 -->

man, who finds that his affections are misplaced, his
tastes unappreciated.</p>

<p class="prose">But must it always be thus? Is there no remedy for
the ill-assorted selections, the wretched mistakes that
are made here? Is there nothing to satisfy the longing
for companionship, that is a characteristic of the race?
Believe it not. "In that world they neither marry nor
are given in marriage," is the language of the Nazarene;
but shall there be no union of congenial natures compatible
with this declaration? Is not the soul, so to
speak, separated into two, each incomplete without the
other? and if divided here, will they not, when freed
from the body, be drawn together by mutual attraction,
and clasping in an eternal embrace, be henceforth essentially
and inseparably one? If to be perfect and complete
is necessary to unmingled happiness, why may not
this union be an ingredient in the cup of heavenly bliss,
and the want of it add to the sorrows of those who have
not, as yet, entered into the fruition of life?</p>

<p class="prose">Tell me, ye who have felt this unsatisfied longing, if
the prospect of bearing it about with you forever would
not, of itself, be sufficient to insure misery?</p>

<p class="prose">But rejoice, ye that trust in the wisdom of the Infinite;
ye that believe he will meet the wants of your
entire being. He created you as you are, and will not
annihilate what he has created.</p>

<p class="prose">If perverted, He may cleanse, as it were, by fire; but
your wants shall be met, and your longings for companionship
abundantly satisfied, for in Him is fulness of
joy, and at His right hand are pleasures forevermore.</p>

    My thoughts shall be given to thee,
For distance prevents not my sharing

How sweet is the spirit's caressing,

And welcome the grief's that prepare us

That sturdy will must shut the gate
    Upon the tides of feeling.</p>

<p class="stanza">And ne'er to be forgotten times,
    When every spoken word
Falls lightly on the listening ear
    Like tones of mocking bird;
For though we strive most earnestly
    To shadow forth the real,
We know how utterly we fail
    To paint the soul's ideal.</p>

<p>SANCTIFICATION.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">Some</span> people seem to have imbibed the idea that children
and young folks have but few serious thoughts.
This I consider a great mistake. I do not believe that
I am so different from others; but in looking back upon
my early years, I sometimes laugh, and sometimes feel
indignant, as the retrospection brings to mind the world
of anxiety, the absolute mental torture that a false theology
inflicted upon me. When I was some four and a
half years of age, a minister told me of Jesus who died
on a tree for little children like myself, and said I ought
to love him. "I do love him," I replied, in the simplicity
of my heart, for the story of his goodness won
me at once. The following summer, if I remember
rightly, I learned to read in the Testament, and there it
said that Jesus died on the cross. Now here was a
puzzler. The preacher said a <i>tree</i>, the book said the
cross; how to reconcile the two I knew not, for I had
not the most distant idea that it was possible for <i>big
folks</i> or books to be mistaken, or tell stories; only
careless, bad girls, like myself, could be guilty of either.
What did it mean? I dared not ask, for I never heard
these things spoken of only by the preacher, and the
book, both so commanding my reverence that I feared
to question; and how my little brain used to ache in
trying to solve the problem! From this time forth I
was in constant trouble. The wonderful stories told in
the book made a vivid impression upon my susceptible
mind, and what the preacher said of the certainty of

<!-- page 56 -->

death for all, and of hell for those who did not love and
serve God, drove me nearly wild at times.</p>

<p class="prose">But it is only the old story, only what thousands have
experienced, and I will not dwell upon it; suffice it to
say that when a little past fourteen, I fell in with a protracted
meeting, and was counted with the converts.
Yes, I thought I had got religion; but my mind being
progressive, I had no idea of standing still; I must go
ahead. The command, "Be ye holy, for I am holy,"
and the like, were they not in the Bible? and being
there, were God's word; and, as he would not command
what we could not obey, it was plainly my duty to make
the above practical. In a word, sanctification was possible;
it was for me, and I must obtain it, or fall short
of my duty as a Christian. Honest conclusion; but
how should I reach the desired ultimate? To be consistent,
or not to be; that was the question. Some
three fourths of a mile away from my home lay Lake
Erie, to be reached by crossing meadow after meadow
belonging to the rich man on whose farm we were but
poor tenants; and close along the bank of the rock
bound shore grew a few blueberry bushes.</p>

<p class="prose">One day, as I went in search of this, my favorite
fruit, my mind was particularly exercised on this same
subject, sanctification. Several months had passed since
I had professed religion. I had become weary of the
sinning and repenting, and my heart longed for rest; if
I could only get the blessing I sought, of course all
would be peace. At length, after a strange process of
reasoning, resolving, and faith, I psychologized myself
into the belief that I had actually obtained it. True, I
did not feel the rapture I had expected, but I had done

<!-- page 57 -->

what I could&mdash;I had given up all, and as His promises
were "yea, and amen," it were sin to doubt, and so
there was peace, and I tried to exult in that peace, but
it was only <i>trying</i>. Blueberries were scarce, so I made
up my mind that I must take them all home, and that it
would be wrong for me to eat even one; but after a while
I found my hand going to my mouth with a very large
one between my fingers. I checked myself in time,
however; soon the process was repeated, again, and yet
again, till finally the tempting berry slipped down my
throat, and away went my sanctification.</p>

<p class="prose">From that day to this I have never been able to find
it again; but sometimes my mind goes back to that long
strip of meadow, to the blue waves beating against
forty feet of perpendicular rock, and to the struggle
between sanctification and the big blueberry, in which
the latter came off triumphant.</p>

<p>CHILDREN NEVER PAY FOR THEIR
BRINGING UP.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">Ah!</span> and whose fault is it, if they do not? Did they
thrust themselves upon you, thus forcing you to provide
for them against your wills? Has their coming been a
dreaded, instead of a looked and longed for event? Be
this last as it may, it is certain that they have only come
at your call; and if you have called from the lower
instead of the higher plane of your natures, then God
pity you, and them also, for the suffering that is thus
brought upon you both.</p>

<p class="prose">"Children do not pay for their bringing up." And
what recompense are you seeking, poor earth-bound
mortal? Must you be paid in dollars and cents for
bearing the burden of God's greatest blessing? Have
your hearts become so stultified that the trusting confidence
of their loving natures is of no value to you?</p>

<p class="prose">Why, children are our guardian angels! To how
much of good have they stimulated us, and from how
much of evil have they kept us back? Some of us are
so selfish in our very natures, that I sometimes think we
should dry up and blow away were it not for the demands
children make upon us.</p>

<p class="prose">But here comes another, who says, "When our children
are small, they lie heavy on our arms; but when
they are large, they lie heavy on our hearts."</p>

<p class="prose">Alas, that this should ever be true! But is there
not a cause? Had they held a larger place in your
hearts ere they came to your arms, would not the result

<!-- page 60 -->

have been different? Had you been as careful in laying
the foundation of <i>being</i> as you are in laying the foundation
of your dwellings, would the rearing of the superstructure
be so difficult a task?</p>

<p class="prose">That we do not gather grapes of thorns, or figs of
thistles, is as true in one department of God's kingdom
as in another; and those who sow to the wind must not
complain if they reap the whirlwind in return. The
fountain must be cleansed ere the streams can be pure.
Study the laws of your own being, and live in accordance
therewith, and you will no more have occasion to
say that children never pay for their bringing up; will no
more find that their maturer years bring to your yearning
hearts a burden too intolerable to be borne, for Nature's
laws are just and equal&mdash;they are God's laws,
and their fulfilment can never result in positive evil.</p>

Pines till its own expanding

Escaping its own darkness,
Light shineth everywhere&mdash;
Yes, light is everywhere.
Then pine, soul, till you learn it&mdash;
That God is everywhere;
No more, no more alone,

<p>POETRY.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">Earth,</span> air, and sea are full of its spirit, and so are
all human hearts. Their hidden fountains are replete
with its untold beauties; but often they lie so deep that
the arrows of affliction must penetrate to the very core
ere they can come forth to the embrace of that which
is without, thus begetting "thoughts that breathe, and
words that burn," beautiful embodiments of brighter
ideas. Beautiful embodiments! yet tinged too often
with a spirit of sadness from the unhealed wounds
through which they have escaped into freedom.</p>

<p>"A CHORUS OF ANGELS."</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time, a man of large heart and noble
charity, who had succeeded in rescuing a lost one from
the haunts of degradation, was speaking of the trials
through which he passed in accomplishing that work of
love. "It was a hard place," said he, "but I shrank
not, and when it was over, a chorus of angels would
have been discord to the music that was singing in my
soul;" and to-night I can say the same.</p>

<p class="prose">Angels of light, my soul leaps with joy as I clasp
your loving hands, and ask, "What am I, that I should
be made the agent of loved ones gone before, in the
mission of love and justice?" Music singing in my
soul! O, these singing birds of harmonic rhythm! birds
that are caged till the sharp, grating file of affliction
rasps away the bars behind which they sit in silence,
and then with quivering wing and open throat, they
pour forth such volumes of ecstasy, that we ask, where
is the place of sorrow, and whither hath she fled?</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">"Through tribulation deep, the way to glory lies;"</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">but when we reach the glory, we forget the tribulation,
or remember it only with the exceeding thankfulness
that wonders at being honored with the draught of purification
which alone could fit us for joys so heavenly.</p>

<p class="prose">Blessed mission! Mediums, mediators between those
in the form, and those who have left it; bearing the
cross&mdash;wearing the thorns&mdash;drinking the wormwood

<!-- page 65 -->

and the gall&mdash;tonics for the soul, making it vigorously
erect to bear the exceeding weight of glory that shall
come after. Blessed mission to sustain the weak, to lift
up the fallen, to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked,
to have the desire to do this, trusting the angels for the
means and the opportunity, having respect unto the
"recompense of reward," that comes welling up from
the innermost soul-depths, saying, "They are saved!
they are saved!" Thanks, O, ye angels! ye dear ones,
whose hands I have clasped, and whose lips I have
pressed in the earth-life; thanks for making me your
agent, your unworthy but rejoicing instrument of good.
And yet ye come, and through mortal lips ye thank me
for what I have done, for what I could kiss your very
feet in the proud humility of exaltation for, the blessed
privilege of doing. With an angel mother's arms around
me, and her breast to lean upon, with an angel brother,
lover, friend to clasp my hand, and shower thrilling
kisses upon lips and brow, why should I fear to enter
into the very blackness of the Valley of Shadows, in
order to lead forth those who have lost their way amid
its wildering mazes.</p>

<p>SLEEPING IN THE SUNSHINE.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">See</span> the maiden in the valley,
        Sitting in the sunshine,
        Pleasant sunshine,
Of a bright autumnal day;
While the clouds that float in heaven
Make the sunshine all the brighter,&mdash;
Make the sky a deeper blue,&mdash;
And the maiden never heedeth
When the sun withdraws his shining,
As behind a cloud he hideth;
For the veil is so transparent,
That his face, but not his presence,
From her landscape is withdrawn.</p>

<p class="stanza">Now the clouds are growing darker,
And a chill is on the air,
While the wind is swiftly rising,
Like the breathing of the tempest,
As he cometh from afar;
But the maiden in her dreaming,
        She is heeding not the change,
For the soothing of the sunshine,
It hath lulled her into sleeping,
Lulled her into quiet sleeping,
        And she heedeth not the change.</p>

<p class="stanza">But the bursting of the thunder,
And the lightning's vivid flash,&mdash;
<!-- page 67 -->It will wake her when it cometh,&mdash;
        Ay! it cometh,
And the maiden springs in terror,&mdash;
Springeth from her grassy couch;
But the storm is now upon her,
And the torrents are a pouring
Down the hills into the valley,
Cutting off for her escaping,
        And the maiden
That was sleeping in the sunshine,
        Pleasant sunshine,
In the storm is overwhelmed.</p>

<p class="stanza">See the maiden in the valley,
        Sitting in the sunshine,
        Sweetest sunshine,
Of a warm and trusting love;
In the sunshine of his presence,
His, the chosen of her heart.
In the sunshine of his presence,
Made more bright by days of absence,
That like clouds would intervene:
Clouds they are, but still illumined,
For his spirit so pervadeth
All on which the maiden looketh,
That the sunshine never seemeth
From her presence to withdraw;
While in blindness she is yielding
Reason's self into his keeping,
Deeming not that he can err.</p>

<p class="stanza">Days of absence growing longer,
With a chill upon them cast,
<!-- page 68 -->For the smiling of another
Draweth now the pleasant sunshine,
Draweth it to hold it fast;
But the maiden, in her dreaming,
She is heeding not the change,
For the firmness of his premise
Hath so soothed her into trusting,
That her fears are all a sleeping,
And she heedeth not the change.</p>

<p class="stanza">But the truth will burst upon her
Like the rolling of the thunder,
Like the scathing of the lightning,
And 'twill wake her when it cometh,
        Ay, it cometh!
And the maiden, wild with terror,
Sees the ruin that is sweeping
Like a whirlwind down upon her;
Sees the scorn that's ever given,&mdash;
Given to those who trust so blindly;
Downin torrents coming, coming,
Pouring down on every side,
        And the maiden,
Who was sleeping in the sunshine,
        Love's sweet sunshine,
Wakes to ruin and despair.</p>

<p class="stanza">Ay, the thoughtless, trusting maiden,
In the flowery vale of life,
Of the sleepers in the sunshine,
She is not the only one.
See, with folded hands they're sitting;
<!-- page 69 -->Laid aside their oars of watching,
While their barks are idly floating,
Floating onward with the tide:
For the calm reveals not danger,
But so lulls them into sleeping,
That they wake not till the tempest
Is upon them in its fury,
And the roaring of the breakers
Tells them 'tis too late to flee,&mdash;
Tells them that the calm of sunshine
Was not given for sleeping.</p>

<p>ANGEL WHISPERINGS.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">I am</span> glad, I am glad, for the dawning of the morning
breaks upon thy spirit; the shadows are fleeing
away, and soon shall the rising sun proclaim the reign
of the night at an end. I have watched the pathway
of thy progress with all the interest that my soul could
feel in that which was as dear to me as my own life,
even thy success; and as I see the time drawing nigh
for the brightness of its earthly fruition to show itself to
others, as thou hast ever felt it in the depths of thy
spirit, and as we have seen it from the shores of the
beyond, surely I may rejoice in the prospect, and
share thy heart's gladness. A new era is rising, not
only for thee, but for others that have waited, watched,
and prayed. The answer to thy prayers tarrieth not,
but hasteneth to crown thee with rejoicing. Thy star is

<!-- page 70 -->

in the ascendency, and though a cloud flit across its
disk, it cannot obscure the brightness of the glory that
shall cause coming generations to call thee blessed; yea,
most blessed, for thy flowers shall be unfading, while
the thorns that have scratched thy bleeding feet shall be
removed forever. But not yet; not quite yet; the
morning dawneth, but those who are in the valley can
not catch the first rays of sun as we can see it from the
hill tops. It was thus, when my soul was sad, that the
angels whispered their words of comfort,&mdash;</p>

<p>MORNING CLOUDS.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">Old</span> ebon Night has placed her bars
    Across the path of Day,
Just as the little twinkling stars
    Were hurrying away,&mdash;
Were hurrying to place their light
Beyond the day-king's searching sight,
Lest he should scorn their milder gleam,
And quench it in his own bright beam.</p>

<p class="stanza">Heavy and dark against the sky
    Forbiddingly they stood,
As if the power they would defy,
    Which pours its rising flood
<!-- page 71 -->Of light and life upon the earth,
Awakening to a newer birth
Each blessing that the God of heaven
Hath to its mortal children given.</p>

<p class="stanza">But steadily the chariot wheels
    That bore the monarch came,
Till rising o'er the eastern hills,
    Robed in refulgent flame,
He saw, that seized with mortal dread,
Old Night had left her place and fled;
Had fled, and never once appeared
Behind the breastworks she had reared.</p>

<p class="stanza">But there across his pathway stood,
    Till, in his living light,
They seemed to be all turned to blood,
    And then they took their flight.
Away, as if possessed of life,
They fled from the unequal strife,
While fragments of reflected sheen
Gave greater glory to the scene.</p>

<p class="stanza">Is it not thus in Error's night
    Before the coming dawn?
The sources that had given light
    Are, one by one, withdrawn;
While thick against the moral sky
The frowning walls of falsehood lie,
And darkness, like a funeral pall,
Seemeth on all our hopes to fall.</p>

<!-- page 72 -->

<p class="stanza">But shall our doubting spirits take
    This as a reason why
The cause of truth we should forsake,
    Or deem that it can die?
Shall we submit to doubts and fears,
When knowing that eternal years
Are given to sustain the right
Against the marshalled hosts of night?</p>

<p class="stanza">God rules, and with unerring hand
    Arranges all below,
Permits the wrong a while to stand,
    That by its overthrow
The world may learn that he is just,
Though patient with presuming dust,
And truth the lovelier be seen,
Contrasted with the works of sin.</p>

<p class="stanza">God rules, and such a glorious light
    Shall fill our darkened earth,
We shall forget there was a night,&mdash;
    That morning had a birth,&mdash;
Forget that e'er the cause of right
Lay bleeding 'neath the heel of might,
Or shall remember to adore,
Permitting wisdom yet the more.</p>

<p>LIGHT.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">"God</span> said, 'Let there be light, and there was light.' "
How simple; how beautiful; how sublime! No coruscations
of eloquence to herald in the mighty truth.
They were not needed for that which could stand upon
its own grandeur as its vital element. "Let there be
light." Hearken! The chariot wheels of receding darkness
are sounding like the voice of many waters, as the
smile of Omnipotence fulfils his behest, by diffusing
itself over the oceans of immensity.</p>

<p class="prose">Light, the garment of God&mdash;the flowing robe whose
hem we may touch&mdash;the illimitable sea upon the bosom
of which we live and move and have our being, and the
undulations of the waves of which shall bear us onward
in our progress from the lower to the higher, from the
outer to the inner life. For within this garment, fittingly
put on, there is a robe whose correspondence is
to the eyes of the soul.</p>

<p class="prose">Close thine eyes, O, mortal, and say there is no sun!
Stop thine ears, and deny the possibility of sound; but
wait till the last ray of light is withdrawn from the
earth ere thou darest to deny the existence of God!</p>

<p class="prose">"And there was light." How it went rushing past
the lifted curtain that had held it from the face of the
newborn earth,&mdash;how it sought out every nook and
corner,&mdash;every crevice where there was a possibility of
ingress! And even so does that inner, that higher light
seek to enter into and pervade our souls. Even so does
it strive to penetrate its darkest corners, to illuminate

its deepest recesses; and it shall accomplish that where
unto it is sent, for the eternal years of God are given
for the exercise of its renovating power.</p>

</div>

<p class="stanza">        <span class="smcap">Though</span> on earth we had no meeting,
        I have heard your words of greeting,
Words that come like rippling music, from that far off seraph shore,
        Telling of the waves of gladness
        Sweeping o'er the lines of sadness,
Traced upon thine earthly being, till it bled at every pore.</p>

<p class="stanza">        Words that wake anew the yearning,
        Which within my heart is burning,
For the blending of my being with some soul I can adore.
        'Tis an ever-restless yearning,
        Outward going, ne'er returning,
As from the ark the raven wandering went in days of yore.</p>

<p class="stanza">        Long I've watched for some sweet token,
        For some branch from olive broken,
<!-- page 75 -->Presage that the breath of heaven woke the earth to life once more.
        But the dove, forlorn and weary,
        Comes from o'er the waters dreary,
Telling that the raging billows rise above the highest shore.</p>

<p class="stanza">        Draining here the cup of sadness,
        Till thy soul was stung to madness,
While life's bitter burning billows swept thy burdened being o'er;
        From the bondage that enslaved thee,
        Thou hast found the love that saved thee,
While I wander searching for it, searching, wandering evermore.</p>

<p class="stanza">        Once methought that I had found it,
        Then I seized and quickly bound it
To my heart more fondly, closely than I e'er had ought before;
        But the viper turned upon me,
        Like a poisonous adder stung me,
Till the depth of love and trusting changed into a canker sore.</p>

<p class="stanza">        Now I feel with life mismated,
        Ofttimes feel accursed and fated,
As the tides of desolation flood my being o'er and o'er,
        And I pray that life's poor token,
        Canker-eaten may be broken,
Setting free the chafing spirit beating 'gainst its prison door.</p>

<!-- page 76 -->

<p class="stanza">        O, my earthborn spirit-brother,
        Well I know there is another,&mdash;
One to meet my spirit's yearning, one to love and to adore,
        Tell me, is my bright ideal
        In the land where all is real?
Have you seen him? is he waiting, waiting on the other shore?</p>

<p class="stanza">        Have you ne'er, at morn or eve,
        Seen him from the gates of heaven,
With a lover's eager footsteps, turning towards this mortal shore?
        Does he know my spirit's anguish,
        As in bondage here I languish,
Strive the balm of consolation in my wounded heart to pour?</p>

<p class="stanza">        Ah, he does! for heavy-laden,
        Sighing for that distant Aiden,
For which weary ones are sighing, seeking, sighing evermore;
        Often times the light supernal,
        Beaming in that home eternal,
Flashes on my inner being, thrilling it at every pore.</p>

<p class="stanza">        When the anguish, all unspoken,
        Of the spirit bruised and broken,
Feeding on the soul and substance till it writhes in anguish sore,
        Is forgotten, till the raven
        Memory plays the traitor craven,
And the bright-hued bow of promise, I, for tears, can see no more.</p>

<!-- page 77 -->

<p class="stanza">        But though storms and clouds surround me,
        Though in darkness they have bound me,
Yet I know the sun is shining high above the tempest's roar,
        And I'll seek until I find it,
        Give of love till I can bind it,
Like an amulet of safety to my heart forevermore.</p>

<p>DRENCHED.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">Yes,</span> and pretty thoroughly too; wet to the skin, and
all from my own foolhardiness. Perhaps you would
like to know how it came about! I will tell you.
Long, long ago,&mdash;before we made our home on the
shore of Lake Erie, away back in my childhood years,&mdash;my
parents lived on what was called the East Hill,
in a certain county of the old Empire State. On the
hill, but not at the top; for after going across the big
meadow, across the pasture field, and full half the way
across the bush lot, and all the way up hill, we came at
length to where the blueberry bushes grew. O, the
delicious fruit with which they were loaded in summer!
and so abundant! It was before I was troubled with
the question of Sanctification; but even in that case,
they were so plenteous, that I could have eaten my fill
without injuring my peace of mind.</p>

<p class="prose">Well, I went one day with my little sister to my
favorite resort, the very top of the hill, to gather berries.

<!-- page 78 -->

Before we had been there long the clouds began
to look black and threatening, and a few drops of rain
foretold the coming shower. I did not like the idea of
going home empty basketed, but what should I do? go
without accomplishing the object for which I came, or
stay and get a shower bath? I finally concluded that I
would do neither. I would break branches from the
surrounding shrubbery, form a temporary shelter, gather
all the well-filled blueberry bushes we could find handily,
take them under this shelter, and pick the fruit
from them at our leisure.</p>

<p class="prose">Sister acquiesced, for she never thought of questioning
my <i>superior wisdom</i>, and so we went to work with
a will. The shelter was prepared, the bushes broken
off and brought thither for picking; and none too soon,
for the few drops that had come, and then held off, as
if on purpose for us to escape, were now increased to a
gentle shower. However, we huddled together in our
house of refuge, and began to fill our baskets; I boasting,
meanwhile, to my silent auditor, who, while she
tried to smile, kept turning her blue eyes towards the
intruding drops, for our shelter was rather leaky,&mdash;I
boasting, however, that we were not going to be scared
out; <i>not we</i>.</p>

<p class="prose">But the rain fell thicker and faster; courage waned,
and water increased in our little domicile, till finally
courage took to her heels, and with little sister close
behind, broke into a full run for home, right through
the hardest of the shower, down through the bush lot,
down through the pasture field; but by the time we
reached the meadow it had spent its force, and retiring
in haste, left the liquid pearls it had flung so profusely

<!-- page 79 -->

over field and forest to sparkle like diamonds in the
sunlight.</p>

<p class="prose">Beautiful, O, how beautiful the scene! But I was
in no condition to enjoy it, for upon my head must fall
the blame of not only my own condition, but that of
my little sister's. You see I have never forgotten it;
and I often wonder if there are not reformers who some
times brave public opinion as recklessly, provide for
themselves as poor a defence, and retreat from the contest
as ingloriously as I did from my fortification in the
blueberry field.</p>

<p>TRUTH, LOVE, AND LIBERTY.</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">Of</span> workers we're a fearless band;
    One common cause unites us;
Where hearts are joined, to join our hands
    For love and truth, delights us;
For love and truth bring liberty,&mdash;
    The freedom God hath given,
And freedom, love, and truth shall make
    This earth like unto heaven.</p>

<p class="stanza">While other souls are drinking in
    The past with all its folly,
We'll follow with the few who go
    Where truth and freedom rally;
On, onto freedom, on, my friends,
    Stop at no wayside station,
<!-- page 80 -->For what are buds and blossomings
    Compared with full fruition?</p>

<p class="stanza">Hardships shall not our spirits shock;
    We know they lie before us,
But standing firm upon the rock
    Of truth, her banner o'er us,
We'll gladly meet the gathering hosts
    Of Superstition hoary;
Her shafts can pierce us but to give
    A conqueror's crown of glory.</p>

<p class="stanza">For souls like ours can never stand
    And see their birthright riven,
While dwellers in this glorious land
    To Error's rule are given;
Will ne'er permit the hosts of night
    To shut the gates of morning,
To intercept the rays of light
    That on us would be dawning.</p>

<p class="stanza">No; by the truths already born,
    And by their birth-throe's anguish,
Though myriads of foes unite,
    Our cause shall never languish!
Through walls of adamant we'll pierce
    With truth, to cut asunder,
Till those who are so fearful now
    Shall shout with joy and wonder.</p>

<p class="stanza">For God himself sustains the right
    Against whate'er opposes,
<!-- page 81 -->And through it to the sons of men
    His matchless love discloses;
A love whose efforts cannot cease
    Till every cloud is riven,
That hideth from the needy soul
    The light and life of heaven.</p>

<p class="stanza">"Go, tell thy struggles and thy victories,
Not as the conqueror tells, but as a friend
Who fain would lift the sad, the fainting soul,
That, sorely tried, but for such aid would sink."</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">"Good</span> morning, Mrs. Cleves. You see I have taken
a friend's privilege of calling without ceremony."</p>

<p class="prose">"Just as I wish you to do. It is pleasant to meet
those we love, untrammelled by the restraints of fashionable 
life."</p>

<p class="prose">"And I shall use my privilege further, by asking what
you were reading?"</p>

<p class="prose">"O, 'tis one of Mary Irving's stories, with which I
am much pleased. Have you not read it? I believe
you take the Journal?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Mr. Hanson takes it on account of the business portion,
which he thinks good; but I cannot bother myself
with such dry stuff, and I never read stories. I think
the coloring thrown over them gives one false views of
life, unfitting the mind for every-day duties."</p>

<!-- page 82 -->

<p class="prose">"Pardon me, Mrs. Hanson; but I could not help
smiling to hear you plead for practical utility, and complain
of the dryness of business details, in the same
breath. I agree with you as to the importance of
selecting such reading as shall best fit us for the duties
we owe to ourselves and each other. That there is
much written in the form of stories which is injurious,
I acknowledge; but in this, as well as in other things,
we can select the good and leave the bad. A truth
illustrated by scenes from real life is certainly more
powerful for good than the same truth without the
illustration; and there are facts enough upon which to
base stories, and make them more interesting, more
intensely thrilling, than any of fiction can be."</p>

<p class="prose">"Then I have known but little of real life, for I have
never seen much that could compare with the stories
that are to be found in almost every newspaper or
periodical one takes up. As to the one of which you
were speaking, I heard sister Mary read it, and I own
it is well written; and had I not felt, as I always do
when listening to such things, 'O, it is all made up;
there is no truth in it,' it might have had some effect
upon me."</p>

<p class="prose">"I see no reason why it may not be true; and if
not, is it not a good illustration? Is there not a truth
embodied therein which may thus find access to some
heart, which could be approached in no other way?"</p>

<p class="prose">"I think truth potent enough to do her own work
without questionable aid. Do you not detract from her
authority, when you represent her as seeking such means
of success?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Certainly not. As well might we think it detracted

<!-- page 83 -->

from the wisdom of the Creator because he often uses
the most simple things to accommodate himself to our
understandings. But to return to Miss Irving's story.
You will be surprised to hear that it recalls most vividly
some scenes in my own life."</p>

<p class="prose">"In your life! Is it possible?"</p>

<p class="prose">"It is not only possible, but actual. You have known
me only in prosperity; and when you tell me how happy
I always am, you little dream of the struggles through
which I have passed,&mdash;struggles so severe, that it makes
me shudder even yet to think of them; but they are
over, and I have gained by the conflict."</p>

<p class="prose">"My dear Mrs. Cleves, you astonish me; but if it is
not too painful a subject, will you be kind enough to
give me some account of the struggles of which you
speak?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Certainly. The pleasure of gratifying you will more
than compensate for any painful emotions that may be
awakened thereby. And, indeed, I think it does me
good to live again, at times, in the past. Poverty is
associated with my earliest recollections. We never
went cold, nor hungry; but our father had to strain
every nerve to keep us from becoming so, for he had
nothing but what his hands earned from day to day, and
our mother's health was such that she could do nothing
to assist him.</p>

<p class="prose">"Often have we staid at home from church for want
of proper clothing; for much as we desired to attend,
we could not go dressed so badly as to attract attention.
I involuntarily looked upon those who could dress well,
and live in good houses, as better than those who could
not; yet my heart rebelled that it should be so.</p>

<!-- page 84 -->

<p class="prose">"You will smile when I tell you that my highest
ambition was to own a white dress, to be able to teach
school, and to make coats. I thought that if I could
accomplish these objects, I should be as good as the
best of them.</p>

<p class="prose">"Never shall I forget the pride with which I put on
my new hat and cloak the fall before I was thirteen. I
had, with the help of the younger children, gleaned
wheat for the first. To procure the means of purchasing
the latter, I went three miles through the hot sun to
gather blueberries; then took them about as far the
other way to sell them; added a little by selling grapes
gathered with an equal amount of labor; knit socks
and braided corn-husk mats for the remainder, the cloak
costing the entire sum of five dollars.</p>

<p class="prose">"I will pass over a few years, my mother's death,
my marriage with a comparative stranger, the bitter
rueing of my haste, and the blighting desolation which
bowed me to the very earth. Indeed, you would as
soon have looked for a tree that had been torn up by the
roots, and left to wither in the scorching sun on a barren
heath, to become green again, as for happiness to flourish
anew in my heart.</p>

<p class="prose">"Deceived, heartbroken, I wandered from place to
place, supporting myself by hard labor a few weeks
here and a few months there. I might have taught
school, but I had lost all confidence in myself. Life
seemed a great failure, and the constant cry of my
heart was, 'What's the use?' I felt that I was out of
my sphere, yet knew not how to find it. Water and oil
could have mingled as easily as I could have entered
into and become a part of that with which I was surrounded.

<!-- page 85 -->

I was constantly seeking society, yet ever
alone; and I would gladly have sunk into annihilation,
to escape from the unsatisfied longing which filled my
soul.</p>

<p class="prose">"Well, after a winter of severe labor, that left me
unable to do housework, I resolved to visit a while. I
had but little money, but hoped to add to it from time
to time with my needle. After spending a few months
among my relatives, I resolved to visit an old friend
who was attending school at Woodville. After spending
a few days here, I intended to visit the home of my
childhood, but I was so charmed with the spirit of the
place, that I knew not how to leave it; it soothed my
wounded spirit like healing balm. I had never before
seen such quiet happiness and such earnest effort.</p>

<p class="prose">"I thought I should like to stay there forever; but
what should I do? Why, I could study; but for what?
O, to pass away time. Life had become a burden to
me, and the lighter I could make that burden the better.
I liked study, and I might as well do that as anything.</p>

<p class="prose">"It was something new, to say the least; so I obtained
a situation in a small family, did the work at small
wages, and took half studies. I joined the Ladies'
Literary Society, which, with my other duties, kept me
quite busy, and I was comparatively happy. Still I
had no idea of using the knowledge thus obtained;
as a person on the cars takes up a book, so did I take
up mine.</p>

<p class="prose">"The lady with whom I staid seemed to understand
me better even than I understood myself; little by little
she drew my history from me, and strove to awaken
hope. She told me that my mind and my associations

<!-- page 86 -->

had been at variance; that I pined for something different
from what I had ever found, and must not be
discouraged if the past had been a failure; that if I
could not swim, it was no sign that I could not soar, if
I would but plume my wings.</p>

<p class="prose">"Remarks like these awoke my benumbed aspirations,
and I thought that perhaps after a while I would try and
do something; yet I was sure to put it off as far as
possible; I would stay and prepare myself for a long
time. But my old feelings would often return, and I
could give vent to my anguish only in floods of tears.
In this manner I spent the fall and winter; but in the
spring took full studies, and sewed for my board, while
the family hired a good strong girl, and boarded several
students.</p>

<p class="prose">"But I soon found myself so reduced for clothing,
that something must be done to replenish my wardrobe.
Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; proposed teaching; but I shrank from the
thought, and offered to do her work the next term, as
the girl she then had was soon to leave, and she knew
not where to get another.</p>

<p class="prose">"She was a feeble woman, and needed some one on
whom she could rely, and I never dreamed of a refusal.
Judge then of my surprise, when she quietly but firmly
said, 'No, there are enough who can do my work, who
can do nothing else. You can teach, and you are
needed in that capacity. 'Tis true I know not who to
get, but I shall find some one, and I shall not let you
do it.'</p>

<p class="prose">"This proof of disinterested friendship touched me
deeply; it gave me courage to make the effort which
proved the foundation of all the success that has since

<!-- page 87 -->

been mine. Those who, with feeble health, have to
depend so much upon their kitchen help for the comfort
of themselves and families, can best realize the sacrifice
made for my benefit, in thus exchanging a certainty for
an uncertainty; for I can say, without boasting, that I
was responsible help.</p>

<p class="prose">"To some this might seem a matter of but little importance,
but it was the hinge upon which great things
have turned; at least for me; and surely the happiness
of even one heart is no small matter. And how many
others might be led from darkness to light, if those who
have the power to do, would show that they care for
the interests of others as well as for their own.</p>

<p class="prose">"This lady was so circumstanced that she could not
have rendered pecuniary aid, had she so desired; but
she gave what was of greater value&mdash;the encouragement 
which enabled me to use my own resources. It is
better to teach one to walk than to carry them, though
at the sinking point; as Miss Irving says, something
may be needed besides words. Yet if there is a heart
to do, an empty purse cannot prevent the accomplishment
of much that is good in the way of blessing others.</p>

<p class="prose">"That 'words fitly spoken are like apples of gold in
pictures of silver,' is as true now as when it was first
written; and could I speak to every suffering, struggling
soul upon earth, I would say, 'Take fast hold of
hope; let her not go, for she is thy life. Though clouds
intervene, hiding the sun from thy view, keep her lamp
burning, and thou shalt yet emerge into the light of a
glorious day.' "</p>

<p>THE FAIREST SIGHT.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">The</span> fairest sight, do you ask,
    The fairest I have seen,
As I've wandered o'er the mountains,
Or by the rippling stream?</p>

<p class="stanza">The fairest sight, do you ask,
    The fairest to behold,
As I've sailed upon the ocean,
    Or through the forest strolled?</p>

<p class="stanza">Prairie flowers are very fair,
    The forests, they are grand;
Salubrious is the morning air
    That sweepeth o'er the strand.</p>

<p class="stanza">And proudly fair the goodly ship,
    With white sails brooding o'er
The restless spirit of the deep,
    A warring with the shore.</p>

<p class="stanza">The birds upon the waving boughs,
    Beside the rolling stream,
Are fair enough, sing sweet enough,
    For Paradise, I ween.</p>

<p class="stanza">The valleys and the fragrant meads
    Seem set in beauty's mould;
The azure hue of the western sky
    Changes to burnished gold.</p>

<!-- page 89 -->

<p class="stanza">The smiling stars come one by one
    To look upon the scene;
And bright-eyed beauty sits and wails,
    Or seeks her couch to dream.</p>

<p class="stanza">The sunlight on the eastern hills,
    The cascade's glittering spray,
The splendor of the noontide hour,
    The closing of the day.</p>

<p class="stanza">The mother bending o'er her babe,
    The father's beaming eye,
And loved ones gathering round the hearth,
    When darkness veils the sky.</p>

<p class="stanza">O, these are sights full fair enough
    To fill an angel's dream;
But still among them all is not
    The fairest one I've seen.</p>

<p class="stanza">The dying day God's trailing robe
    Upon the hill-tops lay,
When I beheld the fairest sight
    That e'er hath blessed my way.</p>

<p class="stanza">An agéd man, with silver hair,
    And brow all wrinkled o'er,
And children's children sporting round
    Upon the cottage floor,&mdash;</p>

<p class="stanza">Rested head upon the knee
    Of her he chose for wife
<!-- page 90 -->Long years before, standing erect
    In manhood's pride of life.</p>

<p class="stanza">And she, with gentle loving grace,
    Still threaded o'er and o'er
These silver locks, with fingers that
    He'd clasped so long before.</p>

<p class="stanza">Or rested them with love's caress
    Upon his aged brow,
And this of all the sights I've seen,
    Was the fairest one I trow.</p>

<p class="stanza">For the faithful love of hoary hairs
    Is lovelier far to me
Than rosy cheeks or sparkling eyes,
    Or youthful vows can be.</p>

<p>MOONLIGHT MUSINGS.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"O, the beautiful light
That cometh at night,
When angel eyes
Look from the skies,
And we call them stars,
While our listening ears
Catch the faintest sound
That floateth around,
Fondly fancying
That we hear the whispering
Of the loved and the lost,
Of those who have crossed
Death's sullen stream,
Who have gone before
To that other shore,
Of which we so often dream."</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">If</span> there is ever a time when angel visitants are hovering
over us, it is when the moon, with her countless
train of stars, is magnetizing the earth with her softest,
most attractive form of beauty. Who has not felt, on
such a time as this, that the very air was redolent with
heavenly odors, while the entire being became so harmoniously
still, so quietly sensitive, that we could almost
hear the movement of ethereal wings, or feel the soft
breath of our guardian spirits upon our cheeks.</p>

<p class="prose">It was on such a night that the then youthful patriarch
was permitted to see the connecting link between earth
and heaven; a link that has continued to this day, in
spite of the efforts of ignorance and superstition to rend
it in twain. Let us avail ourselves for a moment of
our God-given powers, and leaping backwards through

<!-- page 92 -->

the lapse of ages, plant our feet upon one of Judea's
favored plains.</p>

<p class="prose">The sun has retired behind the distant mountains, and
the shades of night are gathering slowly around, when
a traveller from the land of the children of Heth, weary
and foot-sore with his journeyings, comes slowly up a
rocky gorge separating the adjacent hills, and looks
anxiously around for some place of shelter. But no
friendly habitation appears in sight; no dwelling reared
by the hand of man, for he is the first of all his race
who has penetrated these solitudes. But a grassy plot
and a friendly stone soon furnish him with bed and
pillow, and speedily he sinks into the repose of innocent
tranquillity; meanwhile, a band of angels have issued
from the gates of Paradise, and are hastening to their
accustomed trysting place on earth. As they descend,
they behold, on the very spot their feet have so often
pressed, a being in form like unto themselves, but
clothed in garments of a different texture. This wonderful
stranger is sleeping with one hand beneath his
head, and the other lying where it had fallen after
brushing from his forehead the locks that are now sparkling
with the dews of the night.</p>

<p class="prose">For a while they gaze in rapt astonishment, and then
hasten to tell the wondrous tale to their companions in
light. Straightway a ladder is let down from heaven till
its foot rests beside the unconscious sleeper; and through
the long watches of that eventful night were the angelic
hosts ascending and descending thereon, while the God
of his fathers stood at the top, well pleased with the
interest that was thus manifested in this their earth
brother.</p>

<!-- page 93 -->

<p class="prose">But how fared it with the sleeper? Did he know
aught of the loving wandering ones who thus surrounded
him? Ah, yes! for their kisses have opened his soul's
eyes, that he might see, and their whisperings have
penetrated his soul's ears, that he might hear and understand,
while his whole being was filled with wonder
at what was thus revealed.</p>

<p class="prose">But the coming morn summons the sleeper from the
inner to the outer life; the God of his fathers retires
within the veil, and the ascending and descending hosts
are no longer visible. Jacob arouses from his slumbers,
and thinks that he has dreamed. O, blessed dreaming!
O, holy tie between the interior and the eternal! If
we would oftener shut the doors of our souls, and enter
into its secret chambers, we might still see the Father
smiling tenderly upon us, and his willing ministers hastening
to bring messages of truth and love.</p>

<p>SUMMER RAIN.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">Throughout</span> the livelong summer day
    The scorching beams have come
From burning sun, and not a ray
    In passing cloud find home.
The flowers that were the valley's pride
    Their languid forms display,
While those upon the mountain side
    Have fainted quite away.</p>

<p class="stanza">The soil is parched, the streams are dry,
    The shrubs and trees complain;
To quench their thirst from earth and sky
    They seek, alas! in vain.
The little birds have ceased to sing,
    The beasts have hid away;
Through Nature's realm each living thing
    Pants for the closing day.</p>

<p class="stanza">It comes! Adown the western sky
    Behold Day's king descend,
While lingering glances from his eye
    With evening azure blend.
The closing day brings in the night,
    With sombre, quiet grace,
To guard us in our rapid flight
    Through circling fields of space.</p>

<p class="stanza">To guard us and to give us rest
    From toil and care a while,
<!-- page 95 -->Secure from harm, completely blest,
    Beneath her loving smile.
But where, alas! the promised hope
    Of rest beneath her care,
For earth herself must blindly grope
    Through suffocating air.</p>

<p class="stanza">The Day-king's burning breath remains,
    And in his jealous pride
He draws a curtain from earth's veins
    Night's glorious eyes to hide.
The suffering earth, beneath her load,
    Is fainting, and her cry,
So feeble that 'tis scarcely heard,
    Is answered from on high.</p>

<p class="stanza">The storm-god mounts his thunder car,
    And hastens to the scene;
His wrathful eye is seen from far,
    By glancing of its sheen.
Swift fly his fiery bolts to rend
    That misty veil in twain;
Its shivered atoms, falling, blend
    With mother earth again.</p>

<p class="stanza">Down, down they come, these precious drops,
    From intervening veil;
Brooks, valleys, hills, and mountain tops,
    With joy their coming hail.
And earth relieved, now sinks to sleep
    Beneath night's beaming eyes,
Who will her loving vigils keep
    Until the morning rise.</p>

<!-- page 96 -->

<p class="stanza">And wilt thou, Father, thus disperse
    From off our souls the shade&mdash;
The mists of sin, the burning curse,
    That it for us hath made?
When pride shall rob our souls, to rear
    To vanity a shrine,
Wilt thou, in mercy, interfere
    And make us wholly thine?</p>

<p class="stanza">The dross, wilt thou, with lightnings burn,
    Scatter the ill away,&mdash;
Wilt let the good to us return,
    And with us ever stay?
Then shall we rest, devoid of fear,
    Upon thy love and truth,
Until the glorious morn appear
    That brings eternal youth.</p>

<p>MOTHER, BABY.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">I was</span> walking along the streets of a great city one
pleasant afternoon, in one of those dreamy states of
abstraction in which one almost forgets their own existence,
when the words "Mother, look at the baby!" fell
on my ear, and arrested my attention. I turned, and saw
a boy of some ten summers leading the wee, toddling
one by the hand, while the mother looked up from her
work to bestow upon them that smile of love which none
but a mother can give.</p>

<p class="prose">"Mother, baby," I kept repeating to myself, as I

<!-- page 97 -->

passed on my way, trying to ascertain which gave forth
the sweetest sound. It was an idle task, for both were
so beautifully tender,&mdash;so united by mutual dependencies
that one could not exist without the other.</p>

<p class="prose">The poet has said that "A babe in the house is a well-spring
of pleasure." If this be so, then the mother
must be a fountain; yea, a fountain of the deepest joy
that Heaven e'er gave to earth. It was for this that
she was created, and this she will become if inherited
conditions and present surroundings are right. A fountain
of life, of love so deep, so wide, and so high,
that there is nothing in the universe but the love of
the Infinite God which has ever yet been given as a
measure for it. A fountain whose streams of unfailing
tenderness possess such an inherent energy that
neither time, nor distance, nor change can interrupt or
turn them from their course, and whose well-springs,
if developed in wisdom, shall become the beautiful
embodiment of our brightest ideals; yea, shall enlarge
those ideals as the germs of still higher embodiments.</p>

<p class="prose">But, alas! these fountains have too often sent forth
only the waters of bitterness. Their healing virtues
have been neutralized, yea, poisoned by the hand of
ignorance. Deformity has taken the place of beauty,
hatred of love, and contention of harmony; and all because 
man has attempted to divorce the natural from
the spiritual, the law of nature from the law of God.
Crowned with the semblance of wisdom, and taking
superstition as her willing hand-maiden of her wishes,
ignorance has reigned supreme in this garden of our
God, making it but too often a Gethsemane of the
bitterest agony to those of high and holy aspiration.</p>

<!-- page 98 -->

<p class="prose">Yes, ignorance has done this; but the time is coming,
and now is, when the gates she has reared shall roll
back upon their ponderous hinges, letting in the light
of wisdom upon the fountains of life, till, purified from
all uncleanness, their well-springs shall go forth to bless
a waiting world.</p>

<p>THE FAIRY HOST.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">Weary</span> with a day of toiling,
On my couch I am reclining,
    While my thoughts are
Through the open window flying,
To the forest, where the sighing
    Of the breezes
Tells me that the day is dying;
To the forest wooing darkness,
And the clouds of pitchy blackness
    Hanging o'er it,
To the clear blue sky between,
Like another window,
Opening from the landscape
Of my window's bounded vision,
To some scene perhaps elysian,
    Some fairy scene.</p>

<p class="stanza">What is this so brightly flashing?
What the rattling, roaring, rushing
    That I hear?
<!-- page 99 -->'Tis a mighty host of fairies,
Through that open window,
    Coming from afar!
Of their eyes I see the glancing;
'Tis their many steeds a-prancing,
And their many feet a-dancing,
    That I hear.
Prancing o'er the tallest tree tops,
Dancing on the greenest leaflets,
Nearer, nearer, they are coming;
    Of their voices,
Even now I hear the humming.</p>

<p class="stanza">Hark! there is a footstep
On the roof above me!
Now another, and another!
Thicker, faster, they are falling.
'Tis the fairies! hear them calling
    To each other!
Now there is a sudden silence,
Followed by the rolling drum.
Tells it of still greater numbers?
    Yes, in myriads,
With resistless force they come!
Now again the dance commences:
Hopping, skipping, here and there,
Lightly tripping everywhere
About my dwelling,
While the tales that they are telling
    Banish care;
And the heavy pealing
Of their deep-toned organ
    Fills the air.</p>

<!-- page 100 -->

<p class="stanza">Telling tales that banish care&mdash;
For their mission is to bless.
Greenest things shall greener grow,
Beauteous ones shall brighter glow,
And the growing corn shall show
Where their feet have pressed.
Goodly fairies, that from cloudland
Come to kiss the thirsty earth,
    How I love you!
How I love your sparkling mirth!
In the fervid heat of summer,
How I love your cooling breath!
Love to hear your merry footsteps
Pattering, pattering on the roof.
But a something comes a stealing&mdash;
As I listen&mdash;o'er my frame,
Deadening every sense of feeling.
    'Tis old Morpheus;
He has come to urge his claim.</p>

<p class="stanza">Back, old Morpheus! come not near me!
With your fingers on mine eyelids,
With your seal upon mine ear,
    How can I
The fairies see and hear?
Closer, closer still he presses&mdash;
I must yield to his caresses;
I must go a while to dwell
In the land of dream and vision;
Land of terror or elysian.
    Lovely fairies,
I am forced to say&mdash;farewell.</p>

<p>HOW I LEARNED IT.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">"Learned</span> what?" Why, that I could run away.
"And how did you learn it?" Mother told me. You
look as if you thought I didn't know what I was saying;
but I do, and I mean it too. Mother told me that I
could run away, and from her. It was like this: I
wanted to go up to uncle's, and play with my little
cousins; but mother said, "No." I teased till I found
it would do no good; and then, to console myself for my
disappointment, I went out, and made my way to what
was called "The Gulf." It was just across one of
uncle's fields, to the left, and a place of great interest
to me.</p>

<p class="prose">There was a very steep bank on one side, a very steep
bank on the other side, and a very small stream at the
bottom, which came out of the ground in the meadow
just above. This little stream was a very modest one,
and as it was not permitted to run under ground any
longer, it seemed determined to get as nearly out of
sight as possible; and with the rocks that jutted over
it, and the bushes that bathed their feet therein, it was
so nearly hidden that one had barely an occasional
chance to say to it "Peek-a-boo." Well, as I have
said, it was a place of great interest to me, and if I did
not always find, I was sure to be looking for something
wonderful whenever I went there. My first astonishment
in this catalogue of wonders was a bush of beautiful
wild honeysuckle, the first I had ever seen; and
there, too, were spikenard berries, hazelnuts, grapes,

<!-- page 102 -->

and chestnuts, in the season for them; and sassafras
bushes, upon which I so often spent all the strength I
could summon in pulling up by the roots, that I might
have the bark as an article of luxury; and cunning
little birds' nests, equally cunning whether filled with
eggs or young. Indeed, there was no end to the attractions
of the Gulf; so you see it was just the place for a
disappointed child to go and forget trouble.</p>

<p class="prose">When I had sufficiently recovered my equanimity, I
returned to the house, and mother asked me where I had
been. I told her. She looked at me sharply for a
moment, and then said, "If I do find that you have
been up to your uncle's, you'll catch it." What a revelation
was here! I had never dreamed it possible that
I could go where mother said I mustn't; but I could,
and mother knew it, for she was threatening me with
punishment to prevent my doing so. And that was how
I learned that I could run away.</p>

<p>STAR VOICES.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">On</span> this pleasant winter evening,
As my soul is calmly thinking,
Through my heart a voice is thrilling
From the stars that, winking, twinkling,
Seem in upper heavens a-shrinking,
Telling why they seem thus shrinking
As they flash and scintillate.</p>

<!-- page 103 -->

<p class="stanza">"We are shrinking from the glory,
From the grandeur of the glory
Flaming from the myriad altars
Of poor human hearts in pain:
Pained through hopes so slowly dying;
Pained by fires those hopes consuming,
Till the ashes, falling backward,
So bedim the spirit's vision,
That the glory which we shrink from
Is but blackness unto them."</p>

<p class="stanza">"O, these ashes! dead, white ashes!
Let no tear-drops fall upon them,
Lest their alkaline corroding
Should so eat into your soul-life
That your strength be naught but weakness,
And your crown be thus too heavy,
With its glory so transcendent,
All too heavy, when it comes."</p>

<p class="stanza">Hark, again I hear them saying,
"Mortals, would you 'scape from sorrowing?
Cease, then, cease this constant praying;
Quench the hidden fire in motion,
Still the pulse of aspiration,
Fossilize both heart and soul.
If you ask, then you must suffer;
You must grow to what you pray for,
And the pangs of transformation
Come before the glory comes."</p>

<p class="stanza">"You may look, and you may wonder
That there's none to save or help you:
<!-- page 104 -->Your own arm must bring salvation;
You yourself the wine-press tread;
For yourself the cross must carry;
For yourself must bow your head;
But the soul that passeth upward,
Through a way so steep and narrow
That it bleedeth in the struggle,
So expands upon the summit
That to it there's no returning&mdash;
All the landscape spread beneath it,
All the broad blue heavens above it,
But its birth-pangs ne'er again."</p>

<p class="stanza">"Mortals, think you we have travailed
Through the realms of space in vain?
Think you that the deep convulsions
We have felt can come again?
That our silver-hued refulgence
Could have been without a throe,
That we could give light to others
Had we felt no bursting woe&mdash;
Fire-refining, dross-consuming,
Heaving, tossing, boiling woe,
Such as flaming star-hearts know?
Stars, you call us; suns we are;
Central lights to many a planet,
Many a less progressive star;&mdash;
Have been made such by the forcing
Of the fires within us hidden,
Out through every throbbing pore&mdash;
Fires, that to the white heat driven,
Give us now the name of <span class="smcap">star</span>."</p>

controlling the hand of a medium for the purpose; and
this, after he had said, through the lips of one entranced,

<p class="prose">Life and immortality brought to light. The title deeds
of our future existence signed, sealed, and delivered to
us by those who, walking on the blue sea of Eternity,
turn, and placing one foot upon the shore of Time, lift
their hands, and swear by Him who liveth evermore, that
these things are so; while rolling thunders echo their
voices in wondering confirmation of that which is, as

<p>DEATH NEVERMORE.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">'Twas</span> night, and swift the lightnings
    Were flashing through the sky,
Revealing only darkness
    Unto the tear-dimmed eye,
That could not see the beauty
    Which shone above it all&mdash;
For faith, and hope, and duty
    Seemed covered with a pall!</p>

<!-- page 107 -->

<p class="stanza">O, there she sat in anguish,&mdash;
    That more than widowed one;
The light of heart and hearthstone
    Forever, ever gone!
"No footstep now to meet me,
    No fondly beaming eye,
No loved one's voice to greet me&mdash;
    O, would that I might die!"</p>

<p class="stanza">That wish in secret cherished,
    Soon floated through the air,
Up to the Great Eternal,
    In words of bitter prayer:
"O God! my hopes are blighted;
    Earth holds no jays for me!
Of mortals the most wretched,
    May I not come to thee?"</p>

<p class="stanza">While reason thus was reeling
    Beneath her weight of woe,
A phantom form came stealing,
    With footsteps soft and slow,
Into that lonely chamber,
    And fixed her hollow eye
Upon the kneeling mourner,
    Who prayed that she might die.</p>

<p class="stanza">This haggard phantom carried
    An infant on her arm,
The curse of Slavery branded
    Upon its little form:
<!-- page 108 -->A flag was o'er them floating
    Of stripes without the stars,
And chains around them clanking,
    All rusted o'er with tears.</p>

<p class="stanza">While fondly to her bosom
    Her babe she tried to hold,
The slave-fiend took it from her,
    And bartered it for gold!
Then, as her awful shrieking
    Made Misery's cheek turn pale,
The cutting lash descended
    To hush her heart-wrung wail!</p>

<p class="stanza">The vision faded slowly&mdash;
    The storm hath given place
To sweet and placid sunshine,
    On Nature's lovely face;
But still that kneeling mourner
    Her prayer to Heaven addressed;
But 'twas for strength to labor
    For all of earth's oppressed.</p>

</div>

<p class="stanza">        Once "she prayed that life's poor token,
        Canker-eaten, might be broken,
Setting free the chafing spirit, beating 'gainst its prison-door;"
        But she prayeth thus no longer,
        For her soul is growing stronger,
Daily stronger as she saileth Life's eventful ocean o'er.
        Paddling now her own canoe,
        Captain <i>she</i>, and she the crew,
<!-- page 109 -->She will safely pass the hurlgate, where the raging billows roar.
        Putting by the vale translucent,
        She will land her bark triumphant&mdash;
Land it with a song of triumph, on that bright eternal shore.
        Brother, on that sunset heather,
        Though we should not kneel together,
        We shall surely fill our mission&mdash;

freed from the body, will not need a new one to make
it fit for the companionship of angels, for it will already

<p>DREAMS AND REALITIES.</p>

<p class="small">TO MY SISTER SARAH.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">The</span> curtains of darkness
    Around me had closed,
And my wearied limbs
    Were stretched for repose,
When my spirit took flight
    And hastened away,
In dream-land to range
    Till the breaking of day.</p>

<p class="stanza">Methought for long years
    I had been from my home,
But unto it now
    I did haste to return:
Forgotten all else
    In the hope that I felt,
Of standing again
    Where the hearth-circle knelt.</p>

<p class="stanza">O'er valley and mountain
    I sped on my way,
Till night brought a blush
    To the fair cheek of day,
When the cot of my father
    Arose to my sight,
'Neath the shadowing trees,
    On the opposite height:</p>

<!-- page 111 -->

<p class="stanza">'Neath the shadowing trees,
    Where together we played
Ere sorrow had cast
    O'er our spirit a shade,&mdash;
Where the robin and bluebird
    Came yearly to sing
Their carols of gladness,
    A welcome to spring.</p>

<p class="stanza">In the side of the hill
    We had made us a seat,
Sister, you and I,
    And there it was yet;
And there was the rivulet's
    Silvery sheen,&mdash;
A spirit of beauty
    To gladden the scene.</p>

<p class="stanza">The murmuring song
    Of the silvery rill,&mdash;
The seat we had made
    In the side of the hill,
And scenes all around,
    As they greeted my sight,
Awoke in my bosom
    A thrill of delight.</p>

<p class="stanza">A thrill in my bosom,
    But had not the power
My footsteps to stay
    In that heart-yearning hour;
<!-- page 112 -->My footsteps to stay
    As onward I sped
To the cot that in infancy
    Sheltered my head.</p>

<p class="stanza">I reached it! I reached it!
    And quickly was pressed
To Love's purest altar,&mdash;
    A fond mother's breast;
While eyes that were bright,
    And faces all fair,
Did greet me as sister,
    And welcome me there.</p>

<p class="stanza">·    ·    ·    ·    ·    ·</p>

<p class="stanza">O, Father in heaven!
    Why could it not last?
That vision of gladness
    So linked with the past.
Why must I awake
    To reality's doom,
To find that my mother
    Lies low in the tomb?</p>

<p class="stanza">To feel that the home,
    Where I knelt at her knee,
Can never again
    Be a home unto me;
To know that the loved ones,
    Who knelt by my side,
Are borne from each other
    On time's rolling tide.</p>

<!-- page 113 -->

<p class="stanza">'Tis well, but 'tis anguish.
    O, Wisdom Divine!
The links of affection,
    Around us that twine,
Are held in thine hand,
    Though severed they seem,
'Tis that they more brightly,
    More brightly may gleam.</p>

<p>TWO SIDES TO THE PICTURE.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">"Mrs. Ball's</span> Jane has left her; she says Jane's
mother tells her that it is always so; she never will
stay long at a time."</p>

<p class="prose">"Jane's mother! Why, when she first came to Mrs.
Ball's, the story was that her mother always took her
away as soon as she got clothed up a little. When did
she go?"</p>

<p class="prose">"On Tuesday."</p>

<p class="prose">"Tuesday! That was the day she was here to borrow
the churn; the day before the picnic. She wanted
to go very much, but had no money to pay her fare on
the cars."</p>

<p class="prose">"Wouldn't Mrs. Ball let her have it?"</p>

<p class="prose">"No. Jane said she had asked Mrs. Ball, and she
told her that she should give her no twenty cents. She
wanted me to let her have it, but I had no change by
me; then she wanted me to ask you for it, but I thought
she had better ask you herself."</p>

<!-- page 114 -->

<p class="prose">"She did not come to me, or she should have had it.
I think Mrs. Ball might have let her have that trifle."</p>

<p class="prose">"She said something about trying to get it of her
aunt. That was what she went for then; she asked to
go and see her aunt, and Mrs. Ball told her that she
might, after the churning was done, if she would be
back in time to get the dinner; but she did not come
at all."</p>

<p class="prose">"Have they not seen her since?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Mr. Ball saw her the next day, and she said she
wanted to come back; but he told her that his wife said
she wouldn't have her any more; she had gone, and she
might stay."</p>

<p class="prose">"What reason did she give for not coming back at
the time specified?"</p>

<p class="prose">"I don't know as any. Mrs. Ball thinks that she
staid longer than she intended, and then was afraid to
come lest she should get punished. She says Jane had
been quite a good girl for the last two weeks; had been
learning to sew, and succeeded well for a beginner;
that she would have been quite a help to her in time,
had she staid."</p>

<p class="prose">The foregoing remarks were made in my hearing not
long since; and now let us examine the matter fairly,
and see who was most to blame, Jane or her mistress.</p>

<p class="prose">Jane's mother was a worthless woman; only a curse
to those she should have protected; and poor Jane,
though but a child, was left to care for herself; to find
a home wherever she could; and Mrs. Ball had taken
her from the street, one cold day the winter before, just
at night, and thinly clad. The woman with whom she
had been staying had turned her out, for some cause,

<!-- page 115 -->

and the child was crying bitterly, not knowing where to
find shelter for the night.</p>

<p class="prose">Mrs. Ball was lame, and could not, on that account,
get around very well to do her work, and her husband's
income was too small to warrant their hiring it done.
She had hitherto depended upon a sister, who made her
home with them; but this sister was soon to be married,
thus leaving her entirely alone. Jane was large
enough to wash dishes, set tables, run of errands, and
the like; consequently just such help as the circumstances
demanded.</p>

<p class="prose">The lady talked loudly of the wrongs the poor child
had endured, how she had been neglected, &amp;c., and
said that if Jane would stay with her, and try to be a
good girl, she should not want for a home, but should
be clothed up, and made comfortable. "To be sure,
she must have faults;" that was to be expected; she had
been so neglected, it could not be otherwise; but some
one must care for the child, and why not her as well as
another? So Jane was duly installed in her new home,
and Mrs. Ball just as duly congratulated herself upon
the good she was doing.</p>

<p class="prose">Months passed. The blush of spring began to fade
before the brighter hues of summer. The time of picnics
had come. Circle after circle of happy children
had gone forth from the city's dusty walls to revel a
while in the garden's nature. The class with whom.
Jane was connected was soon to take their turn. She
could not go to school, but the teacher had kindly agreed
to let her go to the picnic, if she would furnish her
share of the funds necessary to pay the expenses. But
where was she to get the money?</p>

<!-- page 116 -->

<p class="prose">O, she would be very good, and perhaps Mrs. Ball
would let her have it. This, doubtless, was the secret
of her behaving so much better than usual the last two
weeks of her stay. O, how her heart had throbbed
between hope and fear; how she had tried, by every art
in her power, to win the good will of her mistress;
how she had calculated the chances of success, and
shrank from the thought of failure. She wouldn't miss
going for anything! They were going a good many
miles on the cars; were to have speeches and music!
It would be a new era in her existence.</p>

<p class="prose">But the time draws near; there is but one day left;
she timidly asks for the twenty cents, and is refused.
She turns away with a sinking heart, but will not give
it up so; she may get it of some one yet. She gets
permission to go out, with the understanding that she is
to return in time to get the dinner. This she readily
promises, and intends to perform; but, in her anxiety
to accomplish her object, she forgets the flight of time,
and, ere she is aware, the hour for her return has
passed, and then she dares not go. Poor child! disappointed
all around, and all for the paltry sum of
twenty cents.</p>

<p class="prose">Mrs. Ball could well afford to keep her for a waiter;
let her eat at the side table, and make over old clothes
for her to wear; but she could not afford to pay out
money for her. Not she! But had any one dared to
tell her that she was not doing well by the child, the
charge would have been indignantly repelled. Why,
she had taken her from the street! had given her a
home! How much would they have her do?</p>

<p class="prose">Stop a moment, my good woman. Let us look at

<!-- page 117 -->

this thing a little. Suppose your James or your George
had wanted the same, or even twice the amount, for a
similar purpose. Suppose their mates had all been
going out for a holiday, could you not have found the
means for them to go? But they have always rejoiced
in a father's care, and a fond mother's love, and would
not need it half as much as did this poor neglected one.
Could you not spare twenty cents to purchase a ray of
sunshine to illumine her darkened path?</p>

<p class="prose">And "you wished to make her a good girl," you said.
Well, what better way could you have taken, than to
have shown her that you appreciated her efforts to please
you, by saying, "Yes, Jane, I guess I must let you
go; you have been a pretty good girl of late, and you
deserve a holiday. Go and enjoy yourself; but be
careful to do what is right and proper, and when you
return, I shall expect you to keep doing better all the
time. I know it is hard breaking up bad habits, but
you will conquer if you persevere."</p>

<p class="prose">Suppose you had taken such a course, instead of the
one you did, would you not have been repaid in more
ways than one? You may think you did just right;
but while you are exclaiming against the ingratitude of
other people's children in general, and of this one in
particular, others may form a very different opinion.</p>

<p>A HOME IN HEAVEN.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">How</span> deeply is the love of home implanted in the
human heart! It is ever prompting us to seek some
place to which we can turn and be at rest; that place
to be dearer to us than all the world beside. The associations
of home tend to strengthen the noblest feelings
of the soul; it is one of the loves which elevate and
refine. But will it endure? Will it pass with us into
the future?</p>

<p class="prose">I believe it will, for does God create only that he
may destroy? nourish all the days of our mortal life
that which cannot pass with us through the gates of
death? And who does not know that the love of home
is stronger at three score than at fifteen? And so, says
one, is the love of life. Yes, thank God; and we shall
take life, the life of immortality with us, as we shall the
love of home. This cannot die, for it is a part of our
selves, and being such, shall be gratified in accordance
with the divinest wisdom. Yes, we shall have a home
in heaven.</p>

<p class="prose">We often hear people speaking of heaven as a home;
but to how few has the idea come of a home in heaven,
a specific dwelling-place appointed unto us, a mansion
where we can collect and arrange our treasures according
to our individual tastes? Heaven our home! What
would some poor earth wanderer say, if you should
attempt to comfort him by telling him that the world
was his home? He would tell you at once that that
was just what he complained of; his home was too

<!-- page 120 -->

large; he could not appropriate it; that such general
proprietorship suited neither his wishes nor his needs.</p>

<p class="prose">Alas! of how many may it be said, "the world is
their home," "the foxes have holes, and the birds of the
air have nests, but the Son of man hath not where to
lay his head?" "The world is my home." It is rather
an expression of desolation than of rest; and would it
be less so if it were true of the world to come? Is
heaven so much less capacious than earth? or do we
expect that our spirits will become so enlarged, upon
leaving the body, that we can fill and appropriate its
boundless realms? Believe it not. We shall have a
home in heaven&mdash;an actual residence, fitted up in
accordance with our individual characteristics; a living
expression of our inner selves.</p>

<p class="prose">"Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven," is an
injunction of true wisdom, and, as is our obedience
thereto, so will be the beauty and richness of that
home. How many, who look upon it as a great misfortune
to be poor here, forget the possibility of comparative
poverty there. They busy themselves in collecting
this world's goods, not one particle of which they can
carry with them; but are exceedingly moderate in their
aspirations for a future life. If they can only be admitted
inside of heaven's gate, they deem it sufficient.
But it seems to me that it will not be so pleasant a
thing, after all, to be saved, as by fire, while the treasures
we have accumulated are burned up,
because we have not selected those of a durable stamp.</p>

<p class="prose">Such people show that they have no true idea of what
heaven is. To them it is no living reality; a something
to be wrought out for themselves. The command, to

<!-- page 121 -->

work out their own salvation, has no meaning which
they can enter into and understand; but they seem to
expect that it will be given to them, something as one
receives a piece of property by bequest. They have no
realizing sense that our heaven is, and ever must be, in
accordance with our receptivity; that it must flow into,
and be elaborated through us into garments of beauty,
precious jewels, and glorious mansions, and that only
so far as they are thus elaborated can they be ours.</p>

<p class="prose">"Those who sow to the flesh shall, of the flesh, reap
corruption, and those who sow to the spirit shall, of
the spirit, reap life everlasting," while "those who sow
sparingly, shall reap sparingly," in one case as well as
in the other; and thus shall our home there be just
what we please to make it, or rather, a true representation
of what we please to make ourselves. The insignia
of our moral rank, be it high or low, will be stamped
upon all that pertains to us, and wherever we go we
shall be known for just what we are. But there is one
advantage that those homes will have over the homes of
earth. Our mansions will never become old or weather-beaten,
nor our furniture covered with dust and cob
webs, if not subject to constant supervision; our fruits
will not mildew, nor our flowers wither, because of a
worm at the root.</p>

<p class="prose">We may go forth through the realms of the infinite,
on voyages of discovery, or missions of benevolence,
and when we return, all will be as bright and beautiful
as ever; meanwhile, we may be permitted, from time
to time, to transfer from the garden of our God some
transparent evergreen, some flower of perennial loneliness,
thus adding to the beauty of that home which

<!-- page 122 -->

shall continue to grow fairer through the endless ages
of eternity.</p>

<p class="prose">O, glorious hope! Well might the apostle exhort us
to run with patience the race that is set before us!</p>

<p>A LEAF FROM MEMORY.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza">    <span class="smcap">Long</span> years ago, when I was but a child,&mdash;
Yes, they were long, those years; they did not flit
As now, so swiftly by, but paused to gaze
On childhood's sunny brow. I sported then,
One balmy day, without the cottage door
That was my father's home. The western sky
Bespoke the waning day's departing hour,
When my sweet sister, pausing in her play,
Exclaimed, "Papa has come!" My toys were dropped,
And springing forward, thought to catch his hand;
But there was something in his look so sad
It checked the joyous beating of my heart;
'Twas so unwont I knew not what it meant;
No kiss he gave, nor scarce a single smile,
As on with lingering tread he passed to where
Our mother watched our baby brother's cot.
I paused through fear, of what I did not know,
One moment at the door; but the desire
Which so predominates, and ever has,
Within the human breast, whate'er lies hid
To learn, impelled me on, and I saw what
I ne'er remember to have seen before
<!-- page 123 -->The tears slow trickling down my mother's cheeks.
They fell upon my heart like drops of ice.
I stole me to her side; she clasped me close,
As if she feared some one would tear me thence.
What could it be that grieved my parents thus?
They spake of death. I studied o'er and o'er
To see what that could mean: I could not tell;
But now I know. Alas! I know too well;
For I have seen him lay his hand upon
That mother's form, till, shrinking from his touch,
She hid herself within the silent grave.
They spake of death, a lake, and a frail bark
Upon its bosom rocked, too roughly rocked,
E'en till its inmates grappled with the deep.
I tried, but tried in vain, to comprehend
The fearful tale their looks and words expressed;
In after years, oft told, I learned it all.
Assist me, mournful muse, while I attempt,
In language worthy of the scene, to paint
What is inscribed so deeply on my heart.</p>

<p class="stanza">Within the bosom of a lovely scene,
Itself the centre, stands a little lake:&mdash;
Go thou, upon some quiet summer day,
And looking down into its placid depths,
Say if thou see'st ought to waken fear,
'Tis so serenely fair? But trust it not,
For when old Boreas rises from his seat,
'Tis shaken like the heart by passion swayed.
On such a time there came unto its beach
A band united by the ties of love;&mdash;
Two brothers, with their wives, and one sweet child;
<!-- page 124 -->And maidens too, who doubted not that life,
With all its charms, was all before them yet.
Unto the beach they came, and gazing on
The other shore, they feared to cross thereto,
For lo the winds spake threateningly, and waves,
With sullen aspect, said, "Tempt not our rage."
They heard, and feared; but, led by strong desire,
They ventured forth upon the treacherous deep.
Treacherous! Ah, no, for they were fairly warned!</p>

<p class="stanza">Too soon they learned, that those who take desire
Instead of reason for their guide, shall find
Their footsteps following in the devious path
Which leads away from hope's bright goal of peace.
Swayed to and fro, like some tall slender tree
When the fierce blast comes sweeping through the vale,
Their little bark, unable to withstand,
Or buffet with the waves, was soon a wreck.
What words can paint the agony of fear
That filled their bosoms in that dreadful hour!
A hair's breadth 'twixt them and eternity.
But here, e'en here, the love of life, within
Each human breast so strong, found room to act,
Found means to baffle death.</p>

<p class="stanza">                One trembling maid
Clung with despairing strength to the frail skiff,
And one across it threw her fainting form;
The father, husband, brother, with one hand
Took it and its load, and with the other
Took his wife and child; then, with an energy
<!-- page 125 -->Which comes but in extremity, he swam
And bore them to the land;&mdash;not all of them;&mdash;
His babe had yielded up its little life,
And when the father saw,&mdash;"O, let it go,"
He said, "for I can scarcely hope to save
Those that yet live."</p>

<p class="stanza">                Where are the other two?
For there were seven: the memory of one
Floats o'er the vision of my early days
Like a bright halo. I never dreamed
That loveliness like hers could be eclipsed,&mdash;
That other aunties could be half as good
As mine. Alas! alas! that she should die!
That one so young, whose prospects were so bright,
Should perish thus! But six short months had passed
Since she, united with her chosen one,
Deemed earth but little less than paradise,&mdash;
United first in life, and then in death,
Together clasped, the waves swept o'er their heads.</p>

<p>SIMILITUDES.</p>

<p class="small">TO MATILDA.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">The</span> sun, in his glory,
    Hath set in the west;
The earth, 'neath his rays,
    Lies fainting no more;
<!-- page 126 -->How grateful the dew
    That descends on its breast,
With life and fresh vigor
    Each plant to restore!</p>

<p class="stanza">Thus, when weary thy body
    And sinking thy soul,
The night cometh on
    To invite to repose,
Like the dew may the smile
    Of the Father control
Each troubled emotion,
    And scatter thy woes.</p>

<p class="stanza">The rays of the sun,
    When he cometh at morn,
Are not like the rays
    Which burn at noonday;
The earth filled with gladness
    Now greets his return,
And the train of Erebus
    Flies swiftly away.</p>

<p class="stanza">Thus when morning appears,
    May the sun of thy soul
Compassionate weakness,
    And mild shed his light;
For should he his noontide
    Of glory unfold,
Thy spirit, o'erwhelmed,
    Would faint at the sight.</p>

<!-- page 127 -->

<p class="stanza">In spring-time the flowers
    And foliage green,
Give promise that plenty
    Shall be by and by;
In autumn no fruit
    On the bough shall be seen,
Unless shower after shower
    Descend from on high.</p>

<p class="stanza">Thus the spring of thy life
    May promise to thee
A harvest well worthy
    Thy toil and thy care;
But thy toil and thy care
    Unavailing shall be,
If angels of love
    Listen not to thy prayer.</p>

<p class="stanza">No summer continual
    Sunshine can give,
But ofttimes with clouds
    Is the sky overcast;
What is there, without them,
    On earth that could live,
And sunshine and shower
    Bring the harvest at last.</p>

<p class="stanza">Though grief cast her shadow
Full oft o'er thy path,
Remember that trial
    Makes virtue grow strong;
<!-- page 128 -->If hid from thine eye
    Is thy sun, live by faith,
And the harvest of heaven
    Shall thine be ere long.</p>

<p class="stanza">When the storehouse is full
    And the fire burneth bright,
The hoarse blasts of Boreas
    Unheeded sweep by;
Within the loved home
    There are scenes of delight,
Though thick darkness cover
    The face of the sky.</p>

<p class="stanza">Thus the frosts of life's winter
    Unheeded are felt,
When the fire of God's love
    Burns bright in the heart;
E'en the cold chill of death
    This hath power to melt,
And cause thee to welcome
    The hour to depart.</p>

<p>SOUL PICTURES.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">O, the</span> soul hath many pictures,
    Hung about upon its walls;
Some are touched with heavenly beauty,
    Some with tints of burning gall&mdash;
        Tints of bitter, burning gall.</p>

<!-- page 129 -->

<p class="stanza">Some are painted by the angels,
    Bending from their home above,
Striving thus to give to mortals,
    Glimpses of the charms of love:
        Yes, for God himself is love.</p>

<p class="stanza">But we, in impatient blindness,
    Snatch the pencil from their hands;
Then some hideous distortion,
    Emblem of our folly, stands;
        Ay, a lasting emblem stands.</p>

<p class="stanza">Vainly strive we to erase it,
    Vain to cover up the whole,
For, indelibly transparent
    Are the pictures of the soul,
        All transparent in the soul.</p>

<p class="stanza">And to-day I have been gazing.
    On a thus distorted scene,
Through the many colored paintings
    That have since been hung between;
        By the angels hung between.</p>

<p class="stanza">Pitying angels, spare your efforts,
    For ye cannot hide the past;
'Tis my picture, I must keep it
    Long as memory's power shall last;
        Long as I, myself, shall last.</p>

<!-- page 130 -->

<p class="stanza">I must keep it; but the future,
    With its still ungarnished walls,
Meets me, with a look beseeching,
    As I go to walk its halls;
        Go to walk its untrod halls.</p>

<p class="stanza">Sent by Him who lives to love us,
    Your protection I would claim,
That on what is there reflected
    I may never look with shame.
            Guardian angels,
        Help me trust in Love's great name.</p>

Ere God first said, "Let there be light,"

    In circling clusters sang,
And with the shouting of His sons,
    The heavenly arches rang.</p>

<p class="stanza">And myriad, myriad rolling orbs,

Sprang forth upon their shining track,
    Arrayed in living light.</p>

<p class="stanza">Aye, living light! The smile of God,
    That unto being warms
The singing birds, and fruits and flowers,

    Which, every passing hour,
Gives to creation's throbbing pulse

<p>GROWING OLD.</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">They</span> tell me "I am growing old"&mdash;
    That on my brow are lines of care&mdash;
    That years have left their furrows there&mdash;
That Time, with fingers gaunt and cold,
    Is weaving in my auburn hair
His lines of frost as if he would prepare
For Death a pathway, and his labors share.</p>

<p class="stanza">And I repeat, "I am growing old;"
    Then as I pause to ask the meaning
    Of words that unto me are seeming
Like to an idle tale oft told,
    Or like the vagaries of dreaming,
I see a light from out the distance streaming&mdash;
The light of life in mellow radiance beaming.</p>

<p class="stanza">The light of life, the light of heaven,
    That on the wings of love is flying,
    To win us from our bitter sighing&mdash;
<!-- page 132 -->A holy light by which 'tis given,
    To know that time is only trying
The bands to sever that are round us lying
Our worn-out garments, and we call it dying.</p>

<p class="stanza">Go, tell that merry-hearted child,
    Whose little feet are pattering o'er
    The pebbles on life's sandy shore,&mdash;
Whose laugh rings out so free and wild,
    He's growing old, because the clothes he wore
With so much pride a month or two before,
Are now with rents and patches covered o'er.</p>

<p class="stanza">Ah, just as well as talk of age
    To me because the garb I'm wearing
    Looks dull&mdash;because decay is staring
Upon me from life's fairest page.
    New robes are even now preparing,
And angels soon shall shout the reappearing
Of life's worn book, the seal immortal bearing.</p>

<p class="stanza">Then talk no more of growing old
    To one whose life shall last for aye&mdash;
    Life that throughout unending day
Shall still in higher forms unfold.
    From out the depth of being comes the cry,
"God's image, it can never die;
Death has no sting, the grave no victory."</p>

    The sun adown the west
Is sinking in his grandeur,

While clouds of floating amber

Are reflected in the waters.
    As a heart reflects its love.</p>

    The vault of azure blue,
The sky and glassy waters,

For the beauty they are showing,&mdash;

Are all combined together
    In your love-lit, angel eye.</p>

<p>EARTH ANGELS.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">Tell</span> me not that angels holy
    Only dwell in worlds above;
Come they not to spirits lonely,
    Messengers of peace and love?
Are they not here all about us,
    Not as guests, but faithful friends,
Watching ever on our footsteps,
    Wheresoe'er these footsteps tend?</p>

<p class="stanza">Yes they are, for I have seen them
    Standing by the couch of pain,
Wiping off the clammy death sweat,
    Or the tears that fell like rain.
I have seen them by the hearthstone,
    With their eyes of heavenly light
Scattering every cloud of sadness,
    Putting every care to flight.</p>

<p class="stanza">I have seen them in the highways,
    Thronged with busy, flying feet,
And I've seen them in the byways,
    Where the humble poor retreat,
In the cottage, in the palace,
    By the prisoner's lonely cot;&mdash;
O, this earth is full of angels!
    Though too oft we know them not.</p>

<p class="stanza">Once, when I was very weary,
And the path of duty seemed
<!-- page 135 -->For a moment sad and dreary,
    On my vision, lo! there beamed
Such a wond'rous wealth of beauty,
    Such a fair and fragrant mead,
That my feet were well nigh tempted
    In forbidden paths to tread.</p>

<p class="stanza">I forgot that pleasure's fingers
    Fashion for the soul a tomb;
I forgot that deep morasses
    May be overspread with bloom.
I had walked on beds of quicksand,
    Covered with deceitful green;
But the form of one that loved me,
    At the moment came between.</p>

<p class="stanza">'Neath his blue eye, calm and steady,
    Once again my soul grew strong,
For I felt that God had sent him
    To withhold me from the wrong.
Dear earth angels, O, how potent
    Are your tones and looks of love
To protect us when temptation
    For our strength too strong would prove.</p>

<p class="stanza">Yes, this earth is full of angels
    Clothed a while in robes of clay,
Some of which are new and goodly,
    Some are fading fast away;
But too oft we fail to know them
    Till their work on earth is done,
And the fluttering of their pinions
    Tells us that they hence have flown.</p>

<p>MY FATHER.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">Gone</span> from the earth-life to the spirit-land&mdash;gone to
join her who has been waiting for thee for almost a
quarter of a century&mdash;the companion of thy youth, the
mother of thy children. O, what a change! What a
change from the toilsome unrest of the suffering life
from which father, mother, sister, brother, and wife
dropped away, one by one, leaving thee to "put tired
to tired, and at it again," in thy struggle with disappointment, 
poverty, and disease. My father, I am sad
when I remember that I shall see thy bowed form no
more in the life that now is, and glad that the sunlight
of eternity has risen upon thine enfranchised soul&mdash;has
risen, not to call thee from thy couch to wearisome toil,
but from toil and suffering to soul-invigorating rest.</p>

<p class="prose">Father, mother, and the little sister who has now
grown to womanhood, in the spirit-land, beautiful
womanhood, under the immediate eye of our mother!
Father, Mother, Sister,&mdash;a triune band, to watch over
the six that remain!</p>

<p class="prose"><i>My</i> mother, <i>my</i> father, I know that the Infinite Principle
governing all things is wise and good. I cannot,
I dare not believe otherwise; if I did, I should go mad
with despair! And yet, yet there comes a pang of
agony when I remember the poverty of your earthly
lives&mdash;poverty in all that which develops the soul, as
well as makes the body comfortable. My mother, O,
my mother! my soul quivers with anguish when I think
of the accursed gripe of the "Beldame Sprite," holding

<!-- page 137 -->

thy fine, spiritual nature in abeyance, violating thy
tastes, sending thy proud soul back into itself, unappreciated
and misunderstood, counted as of little worth
by those whose valuation of woman consisted in the
amount of physical labor she could perform, and the
readiness with which she could enter into the gossip and
scandal of the neighborhood; suffering thus, while the
wealth that was daily wasted upon the proud fools of
society would have developed into sparkling lustre the
bright jewels of thine inner life. And, father, when I
remember in those years that she was with us, and after
she had flitted to brighter climes, when I remember the
continuous toil, the coarse fare, and poor attire that was
thine, in order that thy children might have bread, and
that, while others grew richer for thy toil,&mdash;when I
think of all this, my soul cries out, "Where is Justice,
and where the habitation of her throne?"</p>

<p class="prose">Hush! hush! Turn thine eyes away from beholding
the past, lest the sympathetic chain, which binds in one,
should lead them back to the valley of shadows. They
have travelled it once; and is not that enough, without
having its image constantly reflected to their view from
the heart of their child? Away, away, corroding
thoughts! If I can look upon the darkest shades in the
past of my own life, and thank Heaven for each trial,
believing that</p>

"All is well." Peace, did I say? Shall I be at
peace because My father and mother have passed safely

injustice, from the selfish cupidity of their fellows?

<p>CLOUD FANCIES.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">Whither</span> away, thou floating form
    Of soft and fleecy whiteness,
Misnamed a cloud?&mdash; no coming storm
    Rests in thine airy lightness.
Thine origin I fain would learn,
And whither is thy final bourne?</p>

<p class="stanza">Hast thou arisen from the earth,
    The spirit-life of flowers?
If so, thou surely hadst thy birth
    Within her fairest bowers:
'Tis fit that such ethereal grace
Should now adorn your azure space.</p>

<!-- page 139 -->

<p class="stanza">Perhaps thou art of humble prayer,
    The incense that doth rise
Until it entereth the ear
    Of Him who rules the skies;
Then speed thee on thine upward way,
Fair suppliant to the court of day.</p>

<p class="stanza">Sometimes my humble fancy says
    A favored infant one
Has left its little sports and plays
    To seek a fairer home;
And that thou art the floating car
On which they ride through upper air.</p>

<p class="stanza">And then I think an angel hand
    Is hovering o'er the earth,
As guardian spirits to the land.
    That gave them mortal birth;
And that thou art the lovely guise,
In which they hide them from our eyes.</p>

<p class="stanza">By why, through Fancy's wide domain,
    Should I delight to rove?
No lovelier truth I there shall gain
    Than God's impartial love.
Impartial love, for just as fair,
The mists that gather in the air,
From stagnant pools, as those which rise
From crystal founts to seek the skies.</p>

<p>THE EMBLEM.</p>

</div>

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">Young</span> mother, while you're gazing upon some tiny cloud,
Doth e'er its snowy whiteness remind you of the shroud
In which they wrapped your darling, and bore it from your sight,
Your soul as cheerless leaving, as winter's starless night?
Dost ever think its spirit may be as near to thee,
As is that beauteous emblem, from every stain as free?</p>

<p class="stanza">That cloud was once a dew-drop, and rested on a rose,
A mirror for the beauty its blushing sweets disclose;
But when the sun had risen, and saw his image there,
He took it up to heaven, for earth it was too fair;
He took it, lest defilement its purity should stain,
And make it all unworthy to mingle in his train.</p>

<p class="stanza">Then, mother, while you're gazing upon some tiny cloud,
And thinking of the dear one they covered with a shroud,
Remember that the dew-drop, on which you loved to gaze,
Has been attracted upward; is sparkling in the blaze
Of heaven's eternal sunlight; is dwelling in a home
Where sin can never reach it, and sorrow never come.</p>

<p>THE SONG OF THE INVALID.</p>

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">O, take</span> me away from the city's strife,
To the peaceful scenes of rural life;
I long to escape from the withering care,
And to breathe again of a purer air;
To listen a while to the songs that rise
On the wings of love to their native skies.</p>

<p class="stanza">O, keep me not here, for the gushing rills,
As they leaping come from their parent hills,
Invite me to go to their valleys fair,
And to roam with them where the lilies are;
To join in their sports, and to help them sing
Of the matchless charms of the virgin Spring.</p>

<p class="stanza">There's health for the sons of the fruitful soil
In the breeze that sings to their daily toil,
Or toys for a while with their waving hair,
As it paints their cheeks as the roses are;
While vainly I seek, in the crowded mart,
I can find no strength for my fainting heart.</p>

<p class="stanza">The plains and the valleys are long and wide;
There is room enough on the mountain side;
Then why should I stay in this narrow place,
Where the hapless ones of the human race
Must dwell in the earth, or must climb so high,
They can say, almost, that they lease the sky?</p>

<p>THEN.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">Yes,</span> then, just as I found the home of my fifth summer.
Mother used to say that "partnership was a poor
ship to sail in," and father found it true in his case,
when forced to leave our pine woods' home and start
anew in the poor man's struggle for the possession of
God's free gift to man&mdash;the soil. This time he pitched
his tent on East Hill, and went to work, with hands
made hard by honest toil, for which, if ever he has
received his reward, it is now, for it was not here.</p>

<p class="prose">Does the future give compensation to those who are
too honest to succeed here? If not, then justice is but
a name. Little did I then know, however, of a parent's
care. The air was chill, but the sun had sent the
snow rippling down the streams in the form of water,
and it was not too cold for a curious child to wander
forth in search of the unknown. The first discovery
that I made, of sufficient importance to be remembered,
was some wintergreens, at the big end of a very large
log, out in the old chopping; the next was a small pine,
growing so slanting that I could walk right up it, and
swing from the top to the ground on the opposite side
of the stream, on the bank of which it stood.</p>

<p class="prose">This was enough for one day; but it was not long
before we, sister and I, found the "hoary old rock," out
in "the old pasture field," on which we used to hammer
for hours, trying to secure some of the shining
particles which sparkled upon its surface. But somehow, 
when separated from the rock, we always found

<!-- page 143 -->

that the shine was all gone, and to console ourselves
for our disappointment, we would gather up the sand
and take it to the house for mother to scour the floor
with. The warmth of spring soon brought the flowers,
the first of which I gathered from beneath branches of</p>

<div class="quote">

<div class="center">

<p class="stanza">"The oak in the corner,
Where acorn cups fell
From boughs that seemed up in the sky."</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="prose">Presently the big meadow was covered with yellow
blossoms,&mdash;daisies, I called them,&mdash;then strawberries
blossomed and ripened, and blueberries did the same.
Lady-slippers, with their pink and white flowers, shaped
so like a shoe, were discovered in the woods by the
school-house, and sister ran away to go to school, the
first day, only three years old at that, went nearly a
mile alone, and got punished for it in the bargain.
Thus on till the summer passed away, and the winter
too, making one more of the five years that we tarried
ere we were away to the West complete; five years
more of my life, ere we went to live on the shore of
Lake Erie.</p>

<p class="prose">Away, but the heart was left behind. O, the heartsickness 
of the homesick child! The busy scenes of
the day may hold the tried spirit, but when slumber
comes, it returns to the dear, familiar haunts, to wander
there till the dawn of the morning brings it back to life,&mdash;better
say death and disappointment.</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">Up</span> from the region of darkness,
Up from the valley of thorns,
With face that was blanched with the darkness,
With feet that were bleeding and torn;
She came, in the strength of her weakness,
The strength of a mighty resolve,
A strength that was perfect in weakness;
And clasping the horns of the altar,
She said, "I will die at the altar,"
Had fainted and died at the altar;
But an angel, who stood there in waiting,
Threw a strong arm around to support her:
To support, and to bid her look upward,
Away from the cold looks of scorning,
From the looks that were cruel and scorning,
Away to the light of the glory
Which beamed from the region beyond.</p>

<p class="stanza">With the arm of the angel around her,
And the light that was shining above her,
Her feet made a progress so rapid,
That the arrows of envy and scorning,
Full soon they fell short of their aiming:
Fell short of the mark of their aiming,
Till those who had looked down upon her,
And measured the distance between them,
As the gauge of their lofty position,
Forgetting their need to move onward,
<!-- page 145 -->Forgetting there could be a higher,
Found even the lost one above them,
Found her as the angel to lead them

<p>BEAUTIFUL BY REFLECTION.</p>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">Who</span> has not exclaimed "How beautiful!" when
looking at a mass of sunset clouds. Beautiful indeed;
and yet, were we to go thither and attempt to analyze
the particles of which they are composed, we should not
for a moment imagine that they contained the receptive
power for the reflection of such beautiful hues. How
illustrative of the manner in which the greatest minds
of earth are often judged by those who are brought into
daily contact with them. Looking only on the present,
and the fruitions of the present, they discover nothing
remarkable in the results of the every-day routine of
toil and rest; yea, according to their measurement,
often only failure, consequently they pass such by without
notice, if not with contempt; do this, little dreaming

<p>PATIENCE.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">"Yes,</span> that's forever the cry! Patience, patience!
I want to witness results sometimes; I am tired of seeing
those who started in life with me distancing me,
one after another, and with but half the effort that I
am making; whilst I do not seem one whit nearer the
accomplishment of my desires. I sometimes feel as if
there must be a wrong, an injustice somewhere."</p>

<p class="prose">"You are not very happy to-day, my friend. Let us
walk abroad and look upon the face of nature; perhaps
we can find something to dispel this cloud. Beautiful,
isn't it, the variety which everywhere meets the eye?
Streams, forests, rocks, and hills; little flowers and
lofty oaks; plants which perfect themselves in a season,
and trees which require ages to come to maturity."</p>

<p class="prose">What would you think of one who should find fault
because the willow had not the strength of the oak, or
that the apple was longer in maturing its fruits than the
cherry? And yet it would be just as reasonable as for
you to find fault because some of your companions
mature like flowers or early fruit, while you must wait,
like the oak or the elm, for the perfection of your nature,
the realization of your desires.</p>

<p>COME TO ME, ANGELS.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>"Are they not all ministering spirits?"</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">Come</span> to me, angels; come when the sun
        From his couch riseth;
Then come from the Father, with food for my soul,
Manna prepared by your delicate fingers,
        From the great storehouse
        Of wisdom and love;
Feed me, O, feed me with wisdom and love.</p>

<p class="stanza">Come to me, angels; come when the sun
    On the earth looketh,
Like a fond lover, with passion-lit gaze,
Bendeth to give her his warmest embrace;
        Then come with caresses,
        And love's fondest kisses,
Come with caresses and kisses of love.</p>

<p class="stanza">Come to me, angels; come when the sun
        For a while leaveth
His bride to the care of the matronly moon,
Who, with her maidens, will watch till the morn;
        Then come to my pillow,
        And ope with your touches
The eyes of my spirit, your presence to scan.</p>

<p class="stanza">All the night long with you let me wander,
    Forgetting earth's care,
And show me in vision the land of Elysian,
That strength I may gather life's burdens to bear;
<!-- page 148 -->        And show me so plainly
        My errors and follies,
That hence from the pathway I never may err.</p>

<p class="stanza">Come to me, angels, when waves of affliction
    Encompass me round,
And thorns to my temple are pressed as a crown,
Then come to deliver, or come to sustain,&mdash;
        To pilot my bark
        Past billow and rock,
To bear it triumphantly on to the port.</p>

<p class="stanza">O, come to me, angels, in grief or in gladness;
    Come in all changes
To which, as he passes, old Time can subject;
Changes that bless us, whatever their guise;
        Come with your living,
        Come with your giving,
Give as the father is giving to you.</p>

<p class="stanza">And when our earth garments grow faded and worn,
        Come and unclasp them;
Unfetter the spirit that longs to inherit
A body immortal, to go where you dwell;
        Yes, come to me, angels,
        As heaven's evangels,
And lead me from earth to heaven's bright portals.</p>

<p>TWENTY YEARS AFTERWARD.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">Yes,</span> twenty years had passed; twenty years, during
which I had become motherless, a wife, mother, and
widow; and now I was to stand again upon the same
old place, and what a whirl of contending emotions filled
my soul! Uncle's home was near the school-house, and
just by the old path that led across the hills to what
had once been my home; the same path I had travelled
so often, and hurried up the little ones when they
lagged, by saying that bears lived in the woods, and
would catch them if they didn't hurry; and now I was
to travel that path again&mdash;travel it to the same terminus,
and what should I find? Not my mother, for she
had gone to the land of the hereafter; not my father,
my brother, and my sisters, for they were scattered and
far away. I had purposely prevented the friend to
whose house I was going from coming for me, because
it was "so little way across" that I could walk it as
well as not; but when the hour for starting arrived,
aunt was very much afraid that my satchel was too
heavy for me; she would go and help me carry it. O,
dear! must I be disappointed now, after all my planning!</p>

<p class="prose">This matter of fact, practical, good soul could never
be made to comprehend that her presence, even, and
much more the sound of her voice, would be sacrilege
in that hour. No, no, she must not go with me; but
how should I prevent it? She was so intensely kind and
conscientious, that if she permitted me to go without
her assistance, and I should get sick by the means,

<!-- page 150 -->

she would never forgive herself. I was just on the
point of giving up in despair, when she concluded that
if I went very slowly, perhaps it might not hurt me.
With a great deal of alacrity, I assured her that I should
go very slowly indeed, and hurried out, in order to get
away before she should change her mind.</p>

<p class="prose">How familiar everything looked, and yet how strange!
The freshness that I had carried in my heart all these
years, was not reflected back upon me from tree, bush, nor
hillside; and even the pebbles in the pathway stared at
me as if I was a stranger. And I was! I went away
a child; I had come back a woman and how could
they be expected to recognize me? I felt, but did not
stop to analyze the why of all this, as I hurried on,
wooing the warmth that did not come. Surely, when
I reached the meadow, the orchard, the spring, and the
rock, I should be at home then. Alas! even here they
had known only the child. A stranger still; I sat me
down and wept.</p>

<p class="prose">Here, right here, stood the log cot, that was to me
"a cottage fair." It was gone; but not the surroundings,&mdash;the
hills were the same; the fields and forests
nearly so,&mdash;but sleeping away in the autumn sunlight,
nor waking once to welcome me. Here was the grassy
spot where once I laid me down, and tried to count the
stars. Here it was still, and as green as ever, but
somehow its beauty for me was gone. Yonder stood
the old log barn, where I used to go to pray to the God
they told me of, who didn't like bad girls; but he didn't
seem inclined to answer my prayers by making me
good, for, judging by the standard of those about me,
I grew no better all the time. It, too, was gone! all

<!-- page 151 -->

gone, together with the fence, beside which I used to
hunt for the hens that stole their own nests&mdash;strange
stealing that; if every one came as honestly by what
they have as did those hens by their nests, we should
be a very honest people.</p>

<p class="prose">The meadow was there, the same as in the past, but
I didn't feel a bit like going around it on the top of the
rail fence, as I had done twenty years before; and the
"hoary old rock" loomed up into sight just across the
creek, but I was too sad even to go to it.</p>

<p class="prose">O, dear! O, dear! Well, I had carried this landscape
in my heart for twenty years&mdash;carried it there
hidden from sight, as one of the precious things of
earth; and now, as I brought it forth, it crumbled&mdash;crumbled
to dust, leaving me but the ashes of the dead
past with which to enrich the living present. Yes, it
had gone&mdash;gone from me as my childhood had. They
belonged together, and what God had joined I could
not separate. The first pang of disappointment softened,
and I began to question. Is it not well, I ask, that
this is so? If the sunshine, the freshness of the past
could remain to us, should we not lose very much of
the present, and of the future also, from the too frequent
turning of our eyes backward?</p>

<p class="prose">Ay, we should; and it is well that we are not permitted
to overload ourselves with that which blooms in
our pathway, Gone from the external life, both our
childhood and its surroundings; but, upon the walls of
memory's crystal palace, they are stamped in colors of
imperishable brightness, and knowing this, we are
content.</p>

<p>THE RESURRECTION OF THE FAIRIES.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">The</span> fairies have risen
    Up into the skies,
And are looking upon us
    With laughing blue eyes;
The frolicsome fairies,
    The blithe little fairies,
Are looking upon us
    With laughing blue eyes.</p>

<p class="stanza">With the earliest Spring
    They came dancing along;
Earth blushed into beauty,
    The air breathed of song;
They tripped on the green grass,
    They kissed the sweet flowers;
They sailed on the streamlet,
    They sang in the bowers.</p>

<p class="stanza">When the sunshine of summer
    Grew fervid with heat,
The breath of their myriads
    Was coolingly sweet.
As, with thunder their herald,
    And lightning their car,
With the tempest for steeds,
    They came from afar.</p>

<!-- page 153 -->

<p class="stanza">Came to make our pastures
    Spring up green again;
Came to scatter gold dust
    On the ripening grain;
Came to wind their ringlets
    Around the ears of corn,&mdash;
Yellow, silken ringlets,
    By the fairies worn.</p>

<p class="stanza">When the matron, Autumn,
    Came with quiet grace,
They heeded not her smiling;
    But when she veiled her face,
Then the blithesome fairies
    Came dancing o'er the lea,
With the winds for music,
    Piping wild and free.</p>

<p class="stanza">But the cold breath of Winter
    Was borne on the blast,
And the poor little fairies,
    They perished at last.
Said Echo, in mocking,
    "They've perished at last;"
And the bleak winds replied,
    "Dead and buried at last."</p>

<p class="stanza">But I dreamed last night,
    As I lay on my bed,
That the fairies no longer,
    No longer were dead.
<!-- page 154 -->Methought they had risen
    Up into the clouds,
And were casting upon us
    Their tiny white shrouds.</p>

<p class="stanza">I woke, and the fields
    Were clothed all in white,
And people were saying
    It had snowed in the night.
But I thought of the fairies,
    With laughing blue eyes,
And knew they had risen
    Up into the skies.</p>

<p>DESPONDENCY.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">O, this aching weariness of brain;
    O, this heavy beating of the sluggish heart;
And stagnant seems the current in my veins;
    Still, in life's struggle, I must bear my part.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">Why</span> must my body hang, a leaden weight, upon my
over-burdened soul? No, not over-burdened, else
'twould drop its load; 'twould sink and die, and thus
escape the torturing weight; but burdened, even to the
last point of bearing. Hungry and faint, I stagger on,
not falling quite, but reeling sometimes, till my eyes
grow blind with dizziness. Hungry, and yet I see and
feel the bread of life, in all the rich profusion of abundance,
all about; so rich and so abundant, while I feebly

<!-- page 155 -->

grasp but broken fragments that but half appease.
Thirsty, and still the living waters lave my feet. I hear
the soothing music of their rippling sound, but O, they
do not rise unto my lips, nor have I power to bring them
there.</p>

<p class="prose">I feel like a young eagle, that, caged from birth, has
never known of mountain height, or crag-topped eyrie,
nor of the clear blue vault of bracing air beyond; yet
Nature's intuition's true; it beats impatient wing against
its bars from morn till night. Caged, when I look
upon the distant hills, and feel there is a beauty there I
cannot fathom. Caged, when I gaze on fields and
flowers, and find a veil between me and their loveliness.
Caged, when the surging sea of human life comes rolling
by in mighty waves, for lo! I cannot grasp the chain
that binds them to each other; I cannot get into the
stream of their magnetic life.</p>

<p class="prose">Yet I have held some hands in mine, have looked
into some eyes, and pressed some lips, to drink the current
of electric wine, till my whole being seemed filled
to its fulness full, and still I turned away and thirsted
still. O God! is there no fountain that will satisfy,
or being such, must my caged soul be shut from it for
ever! Cease! cease! I'll rest a while; I'll sleep; perhaps
I thus may gain new strength to batter down these
walls, and then I shall be free.</p>

<p>HEAVEN'S NEED OF EARTH.</p>

</div>

<div class="quote">

<p class="prose">"And I heard the voice of the angel who spake unto me, saying,
'Come, and I will show thee that heaven hath need of earth.' "</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">The</span> myriad hosts of the shining stars
Sent a silvery stream of mellow light
Through my half-closed window frame,
While the night birds song,
And the sweet perfume
Of the opening rose,
Was borne on the zephyr's wing
To fan my brow,
And to soothe my soul,
As I dreamed of my angel home.</p>

<p class="stanza">Methought, from the land beyond the stars,
    That a wondrous angel came;
The thunder rolled from his chariot wheels,
    And his steeds were the lightning's flame.</p>

<p class="stanza">In stature and form he was like a God,
    And his robe, of the purplest hue,
Was girdled about with a zone of light
That looped it back from his vesture white,
    From his vesture white as the snow.</p>

<p class="stanza">The golden wealth of his flowing hair
    O'er his shoulders went rippling down;
Went rippling down, like shimmering waves
    That the summer sun shines on.</p>

<!-- page 157 -->

<p class="stanza">His eyes were as blue as the bluest depths
    Of the azure line vault above,
And in them the look that I love to see
    In the eyes of the one that I love.</p>

<p class="stanza">With a graceful curb to his flying steeds,
    As the chariot wheels drew nigh,
He caught my hand, and soon by his side
    I sped through the upper sky.
Away, away through the upper sky;
The thunder rolled from our chariot wheels,
As we sped through the upper sky.</p>

<p class="stanza">On, on we fled through the measureless realms
    That lead to the great hereafter,
While the thunder rolled from our chariot wheels,
    And our lightning steeds flew faster.</p>

<p class="stanza">Hark! Another sound is falling,
    Falling gently on the ear;
Borne upon the wing of silence,
    Sweetly low, distinctly clear.</p>

<p class="stanza">'Tis the outermost sound
Of the outermost wave
Of the mighty rhythmic ocean,
Where the poetry of motion
And the poetry of song
Roll their billowy swells along,
Bound together by the beauty
Of the grand harmonic throng.</p>

<!-- page 158 -->

<p class="stanza">Still faster flew our lightning steeds,
And the billowy sounds grew stronger;
But from the track of our chariot wheels
The thunder rolled no longer,
For softer than down
From paradise birds
Was the flowery way that we sped on,
Till we came at length
To the myriad hosts
Who dwell in the land Elysian.</p>

<p class="stanza">But forms are vain, and words are weak;
The choicest of their golden fruit,
That e'er in pictured silver
Have been set, would fail to paint
The matchless glories of that realm
To which I, with my angel guide,
Had come at length.</p>

<p class="stanza">                Yes, words are vain.
The purest, sweetest, loftiest flow
That ever fell from mortal lips
Would serve me but to weave a veil,
Hiding therewith ethereal brightness.
Would dim the radiance of these forms
That, walking upon waves of light,
Sink not, but rather rise and float,
Attracting upwards that on which
They tread.</p>

<p class="stanza">I gazed and drank, and drank and gazed,&mdash;
Drank with each quickened sense of bliss,
Ecstatic bliss; drank till my soul was filled,
<!-- page 159 -->Even to an aching fulness full;
A fulness that, akin to pain, still strove,
Yea, travailed to implant in other hearts
The germs of that deep bliss which,
Welling upwards, sought for place to o'erflow;
For place! But where? For, lo! such heart
Beat to the bounding pulse of heaven.
Each face reflected loveliness,
Each eye beamed with the steady light
Of ceaseless happiness. No want!
No vacuum! Even the very air,
Alive with thrills of harmony,
And pressing close on every side,
As lovers press the lips they love.
No room! no room to store excess!
Expand, my soul, and still expand,
For still the swelling flood rolls on,
To pour itself into thy being's depths!</p>

<p class="stanza">But hark! ay, hark! The sound that comes
Like rolling thunder's trebled power,
Softened to blend with zephyr's tone.
Does some new joy, still mightier
Than the last, waken to new response,
That thus the deepening swell quivers
Through arches of eternal heights?
Ay, hark the words! " 'Tis found! 'tis found!
A place where need exists; a need
To which our fulness can apply."</p>

<p class="stanza">From the fountain of causation,
Lo! attraction's gravitation
<!-- page 160 -->Brings a germinal creation
Forward to a glorious birth.
And the morning stars are singing,
And the sons of God are shouting,
Shouting o'er the new-born earth,
While the blending echoes deepening
Tell how much the thought is worth.
The thought, the certainty, that thus
Their energies shall find full scope,
Ay, blissful scope,
In leading up to heaven the race,
The wondrous race that earth shall give.
Full scope for angel powers to pilot through
The pathway of their earthly life,
Progression's pathway, where experience
Sits enthroned as arbiter of fate,&mdash;
To pilot through the stinging thorns
Of which she plaits a crown for all,&mdash;
To pilot and sustain a race
Whose myriads none as yet can tell,
"But myriads though there be, still,
Unto us 'tis given,"&mdash;'twas thus they sang,&mdash;
"To bring them all to this our heaven."</p>

<p>LOVE'S TRIUMPH.</p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

<p class="stanza"><span class="smcap">When</span> the moon hung high in heaven,
And the little stars were peeping,
Through the wealth of leaves and blossoms,
With which spring the earth had crowned,
Sat a maiden on that earth,&mdash;
Sat a maiden, where the tears
That heavens are nightly weeping,
O'er the wants and woes of mortals,
Could not fall upon her ringlets,
For they hung upon the blossoms,
Apple blossoms, overhead.
Hung and sparkled in the moonlight,
Hung and sparkled on the blossoms,
Sparkling tears upon the blossoms,
Like the pearls on Beauty's breast.
Still the moon kept on her journey,
Still the little stars kept peeping
Through the blossoms at the maiden,
While the breath of angels, stealing
O'er them, kept a constant falling,
Till the earth was white around,
And the maiden kept her watching,
Patient watching, for 'twas given,
Moons before, that aged apple
As the trysting place of love.</p>

<p class="stanza">Moons had waxed from pointed crescents
To the fulness of their splendor,
<!-- page 162 -->Waxed and waned again to crescents,
As the rolling year went round,&mdash;
Waxed and waned until the May moon
Showed the brightness of its face,
Making, since her William left her,
The year of waiting all complete.
For when last the apple blossoms
Hung as now upon the boughs,
Hung upon the boughs so lightly,
That the breath of listening angels
Scattered them upon the ground,
He had stood beneath that apple,
With his arm about her waist,
With her head upon his bosom,
Resting fondly, yet in anguish,
While they whispered words of parting,
Words that wrung their hearts full sore.</p>

<p class="stanza">"Linda, darling, I must leave you,&mdash;
So my cruel father says;
I have plead,&mdash;'tis worse than useless,&mdash;
I must yield to his behest;
Though I yield me but in seeming,
For my heart will still be yours,
And I'll sail across the ocean,
To that land of which he tells;
I will go in outward seeming,
Like to one that could forget;
But the gold that he hath given
Shall be spent a home to purchase,
Then I'll come again for you.
Linda, darling, you can trust me,
<!-- page 163 -->Though no word from me you hear;
Should I write, they might discover
And thus our fondest hopes defeat;
But when next the apple blossoms
Hang as now upon the boughs,
Then come here again to meet me,
For 'tis then I'll come for you.
Time is flying, I must leave you,"
Said he, as he stooped to kiss her,
Kissed the hands he held in his,
Kissed her eyes, her lips, her forehead,
Kissed her where an apple blossom,
Borne upon a zephyr's wing,
Rested on her cheek a moment,
That their tints it might compare;
Kissed her there, and then he left her,
For he could no longer stay,&mdash;
Left her for his father's mansion,
Where the lofty turrets rise,
Telling of their owner's greatness,
Greatness such as wealth bestows,
While she to the humble cottage,
With its unpretending walls,
Whitewashed in their simple neatness,
By the good old gardener's hand,
Turned her when retreating footsteps,
William's footsteps, to her ear
Sent no more their faintest sound.
Turned her to the humble cottage,
Sought her couch with snow-white spread,
Fell upon her knees beside it,
Gave to Heaven her hopes and fears,
<!-- page 164 -->Gave herself into its keeping,
Asked for him protecting care,
Who with her in heart was mated,
Asked it all in trusting faith;
Then in peace she sought her pillow,
For her spirit was at rest;
Slept in peace and woke to duty,
With the morrow's rising sun.
What had she, the loving hearted,
She, the pure in heart and loving,
What had she to do with doubts?
Had she not, a helpless foundling,
Born of whom she never knew;
Had she not in love been cared for,
From her infancy till now?
Had not God the Father kept her
All her life, and made her blest,
And did not young William love her?
Why should not her spirit trust?</p>

<p class="stanza">Yes, she slept and woke to duty,
With an eye that beamed as brightly,
And a foot that tripped as lightly,
In and out the cottage door;
And her ringlets, in the sunlight,
Looked as much like liquid wavelets,
Bathing brow and neck and shoulders,&mdash;
Wavelets on which fays were dancing,
Ringlets through which they were flinging,
With their nimble fingers flinging
Sparkling gems of golden light,
And her cheeks were just as much like
<!-- page 165 -->Roses resting upon lilies,
As when first she learned that William,
Noblest youth in all the country,
Loved her with an honest love.</p>

<p class="stanza">And just as eagerly did he,
Young William's father, Lord of Linn,
Who scorned it that his only son
Had learned to love the lowly one,
The foundling child who had been reared
Within his gardener's humble cot;
Ay, just as eagerly did he
Gaze with his wolfish eye upon
This pure and unsuspecting one,
As he had gazed when William stood
A guardian angel by her side.
But William now is far away,
Not there his watchful eye of love,
To guard from harm the pure white dove,
Not there his watchful eye of love:
Is there, then, no eye that's watching,
Fiendish wiles to be defeating?
Foolish man, art thou so blinded
With the sulphury smoke that's rising,
Rising from the fetid passions
Of thine own perverted nature,
That with all thy fear hast parted,
of the present, or the future,
And in heart art boldly saying,
"I have laid my plans in wisdom,
And my triumphing is sure?"
On, nor pause in thy pursuing&mdash;
<!-- page 166 -->On, but know that God is mocking
All the wisdom of thy planning,
And the arrow thou art pointing
For the bosom of another,
Shall be turned upon thine own;
Barbed, and turned upon thine own.</p>

<p class="stanza">But the question here arises,
That if figs come not of thistles,
If from thorns no grapes we gather,
If the tiger's whelp 's a tiger,
And the eaglet like its sire,
Why should Nature's laws, unerring,
Be for man thus set aside?
How could son of such a father
Be so kindly, nobly true?
Thistles, they seem worse than useless,
Tend them howsoe'er you may;.
Tiger's whelps will be ferocious,
Eaglets turn to eye the sun;
But the thorn-tree, by the gardener,
It may be so pruned and grafted,
That its roots are found supporting
Boughs that gracefully are bending,
Bending with the choicest fruit.
William had a noble mother,
But her gentle, dove-like spirit
Fainted in the thorny pathway
That her feet were doomed to tread;
Fainted, died, and left her darling
To the father, whose unkindness
Had so wrung her living heartstrings,
That for grief they snapped in twain.
<!-- page 167 -->Yes, she fainted in the pathway,
And the angels came and bare her
Through the trackless realms of ether,
Up to where the gates of heaven
Open wide to give admission
To the suffering ones of earth:
Bore her through the shining portals,
On to where the waters gushing
From the throne of the Eternal,
Living waters are a-hasting
Onward to each distant portion
Of His infinite domains.</p>

<p class="stanza">As, on the expansive bosom,
Known as space, we find the centre
Of each planetary system,
I a sun, whose bright attraction
Keeps the planets circling round him,&mdash;
Larger suns with larger planets,
Greater in their number, too;
So, amid the constellations
Formed by sparkling emanations,
From the central sun of spirit,
Known on earth as the Great Father,
We find suns of glorious brightness,
With the lesser circling round them;
All the Spirit Father giveth,
To each one, are drawn unto them.
'Guided by the heart's attraction,
Still the angels bore her onward,&mdash;
Onward bore our William's mother,
On to where the Man of Sorrows,
<!-- page 168 -->Once with thorns, but now with glory,
Crowned as King and Priest forever,
While new gems, of richest lustre,
Still are added from our earth sphere,
Gems that have been won unto Him,
By His tears and bloody sweat;
Bore her where He sat, the centre
Of the myriads of millions,
Central sun of stars unnumbered.
For a moment the archangels,
Who stood nearest to the throne,
Rested on their golden trumpets,
Gold refined till more transparent
Than the crystal streams of earth,
While the cherub and the seraph
Paused them till the young earth mother
Should receive her crown and blessing,
And her place among them take.
Lowly, filled with joy and wonder,
Knelt she at the feet of Jesus,
Raised her eyes in mute appealing
To that face so meek and loving,
While in tones most sweetly thrilling,
"Daughter, what is thy petition?"
Came from out his gracious lips.
Once again that mute appealing,
All the heart's desire revealing,
While the blest Messiah smiling,
Turned him to the hosts in waiting,&mdash;</p>

<p class="stanza">"Home is wheresoe'er the heart is;
And the heart of this young creature,
<!-- page 169 -->Angel now, but still a mother,
Turneth to the budding blossom
That was hers on earth to watch o'er,
Asketh that she still may guard it:
Love hath granted her petition,
Back, conduct her, waiting angels,
To the home in which ye found her,
And remain ye near to aid her
In the earnest, patient labor,
Which to love is purest pleasure."</p>

<p class="stanza">Backward through the realms of ether,
To the earth again they bore her;
Then, as myriads unnumbered
Swept their harp strings, this the chorus
of the symphony they sang:&mdash;</p>

<p class="stanza">        "In the earth beneath,
            On the heavens above,
        There is naught so strong
            As the chords of love;
        Love, love, love,
        Great is the triumph,
        The triumph of love."</p>

<p class="stanza">While the myriads in waiting
Sent their answer onward rolling
Through the countless courts of heaven,
Rolling onward till its echoing
Struck and thrilled upon the heartstrings
of the trembling ones of earth,&mdash;
<!-- page 170 -->"Can a mother e'er forget
The child that 'neath her bosom slept?
Yes, she may; but O, our Father,
Thine's a love that lasts forever!
Written on the living tablet
Of thy tenderest of hearts,
Are the names of all thy children,
And thy love shall triumph yet."</p>

<p class="stanza">A lonely boy of summers seven
    Stood by his pale dead mother,
And strove, with thought beyond his years,
    His choking sobs to smother;
She's gone to the bright, bright world above,
She's gone to dwell with the God of Love,
For so she said, but she is dead;
And his tears flowed on till the angel, Sleep,
Kissed his eyes that he could not weep.
He slept, and dreamed that his mother came
To the side of his couch, and called his name;
She seemed to come from the viewless air,
As she placed her hands in his clustering hair,
And pressed to his lips, that thrilled with bliss,
To his lips and brow, a mother's kiss.</p>

<p class="stanza">Yonder moon, that in her journey
Down the western skies went gliding,
And the little stars a peeping
Through the curtains at the sleeper,
Saw the smile of joy that lighted
All his face, so sadly mournful,
As his mother came from heaven,
<!-- page 171 -->Once again to be a watcher.
O'er the footsteps of her child.
Yes, they saw, and winked, and twinkled,
As they faded into daylight;
Moon and stars that into daylight
Faded like that lovely vision
From the eyes of William's spirit:
Moon and stars were only covered,
Only hid in depths of daylight,
And the vision, just as real,
Was not covered, but the soul's eyes
That had opened but a moment,
They were closed and could not see.
Yes, the vision it was real,&mdash;
Real as the moon and stars were,&mdash;
Real as the morning sunlight
Falling on the sleeper's eyelids,
Waking him again to weeping,
As he gazes on the coffin
Where the dear, dear face is lying,&mdash;
On the lips he's kissed so often,
Death-cold lips that cannot bless him:
Bitter, bitter, is his weeping,
For he knows not that an angel
O'er him now in love is watching,
And will through his mortal life.</p>

<p class="stanza">    In a little cottage,
        Standing by a brook,
    Where the very vine leaves
        Wore a quiet look;
    Sheltered from the sun's heat,
    <!-- page 172 -->    Sheltered from the wind,
    By the hills and maples
        Rising up behind,
    Lived a gentle maiden,
        Like a lily fair;
    O'er her neck and shoulders,
        Waves of golden hair
    Flowed in rich profusion,
        While her modest eyes
    Were like unto the violets,
        Or like the summer skies.</p>

<p class="stanza">    With her agéd father,
        In this quiet nook,
    Lived the blithesome maiden,
        By the rippling brook;
    Rising with the day dawn,
        Singing like a lark,
    Through the hours of labor
        Till the shadows dark
    Stretched across the valley,
        Then she sought her couch,
    Slept in peaceful quiet
        Till the morning broke.
    Knowing less of evil
        Than the mourning dove
    Knows of hate, when singing
        Of her absent love,
    Like a placid river
        Flowed her life along,
    From the early morning
        Till the set of sun,
    <!-- page 173 -->From the blush of spring-time
        Till the maple leaves
    Turned a golden yellow
        And sailed upon the breeze.</p>

<p class="stanza">    But autumn hours
        Their onward flight are winging,
    And thrifty vine
        Around a young oak clinging,
    With purple grapes
        In tempting clusters hanging,
    Has wooed the maid
        From out her father's cottage.</p>

<p class="stanza">    Her basket filled,
        Along the vale she wandered
    To where the stream
        Gave up its quiet flowing,
    And down the rocks
        In silver sheen went dancing;
    Her voice the while
        In tuneful notes is singing.</p>

<p class="stanza">    Over the hills
        The hunter's horn is sounding;
    From rock to rock
        The frightened stag is bounding;
    In swift pursuit
        The deep-mouthed hounds are baying,
    As thus the maid
        Adown the vale is straying.</p>

<!-- page 174 -->

<p class="stanza">    But dancing stream
        And her own gladsome singing
    So filled the air,
        She knows not of their coming,
    Till stag and hound,
        With hunter's steed behind them,
    In smoking haste
        Burst through the glade upon her.</p>

<p class="stanza">    Like a frightened fawn
        She bounded away;
    But a loosened stone
        In her path that lay,
    As her flying feet
        To its surface pressed,
    Was torn from its hold,
        And the maid was cast
    To the rocks below,
        Where the silvery sheen
    Was changed to foam
        In the dancing stream.</p>

<p class="stanza">  O, let her die now!
        It will be more sweet
    With the wreathing foam
        For her winding-sheet,
    For her spirit pure
        Thus to pass away,
    Than to wake again
        To the light of day;
<!-- page 175 -->    To the light of day,
        Such as earth bestows,
    Which shines but to blind
        To its bitterest woes.</p>

<p class="stanza">    O, let her die now!
        And an angel smiled,
    As she tenderly bent
        O'er her fainting child;
    Smiled with the hope
        That the trusting heart
    Would never be pierced
        With the poisoned dart,&mdash;
    With the bitter pangs
        That the innocent know,
    If they tarry long
        In this world of woe.</p>

<p class="stanza">    O, let her die now!
        Yet again she cried,
    As the foremost steed
        With its rider she spied;
    For her eye, undimmed.
        With the mists of earth,
    Could look at the heart
        In its moral worth,
    And the heart that beat
        In that god-like form
    Was black as the clouds
        Of a coming storm.</p>

<!-- page 176 -->

<p class="stanza">    But the panting steed
        Is riderless now,
    And the youth has leaped
        To the rocks below,&mdash;
    Has rescued the maid
        Ere her failing breath
    Had carried her quite
        To the arms of death;
    But the arms of death
        Would have given no pain,
    While these bring to life
        But to take it again.</p>

<p class="stanza">Once again the leaves of maple
They have felt the frost king's kiss,
Changing them to golden yellow,
Or to gorgeous crimson hues;
Once again the tempting clusters
From the thrifty vine are hanging
O'er the stream that goes a rippling,&mdash;
Rippling, murmuring down the vale,&mdash;
Rippling o'er its pebbly bottom
With a murmuring sound of sadness,
For the merry-hearted maiden,
Who along its banks went tripping
With a foot of airy lightness,
Who along its banks went thrilling
Music of such winning sweetness,
That the birds their songs suspended,
Pausing on the boughs to listen.
She away, away has wandered,
<!-- page 177 -->Far away o'er hills and valleys,
Searching for the recreant lover
Who with gentle words had wooed her
Where the torch, at Hymen's altar,
Burns to light its devotees.
But the torch, it was a false one,
Held by hands as basely false;
Power assumed by one who had none,
Priestly robe and saintly face;
Thus they lured the trusting maiden,
Thus they snared her youthful feet;
But the soul, in unstained whiteness,
This their plotting could not reach.
Though a lonely wanderer straying,
Deemed by others fallen, fallen,
Yet the soul, in unstained whiteness,
Was caressed by pitying angels,
Who went with her in the pathway,
Leading her she knew not whither,
On and on to where a mansion,
Where a proudly towering mansion,
Whence there cometh sounds of wailing,
Meets her weary, weeping eyes.</p>

<p class="stanza">O, how lovely is the landscape
    Bursting on the wanderer's sight,
With the mansion's lofty turrets
    Sparkling in the morning light;
With the grand old wood beyond it,
    And the hills that gently rise,
Till they blend them with the mountains
    Marked against the western skies:
<!-- page 178 -->With its valleys and its meadows,
    Hedges, cows, and browsing sheep,
With its little mimic ledges,
    Over which the streamlets leap;
Peasant's cot and thrifty farm-house,
    Towering oaks and graceful elms,
And the church spire in the distance
    Seen beneath their spreading arms.
But o'er all this scene of beauty
    Floats the sadly sighing breath
Of a sorely stricken people;
    For the clasping arms of death
Hold the lady of the mansion
    In their unrelenting grasp.</p>

<p class="stanza">This is why that thus there floateth
    On the air such sounds of wailing;
This is why the lonely wanderer,
    With her hopes in dust a-trailing;
This is why she sees them coming
    Thus from all the country o'er;
They would look upon the features
    That from thence they'll see no more.
Wait the Flora, by the hedge side,
    Scan their features one by one;
You, perhaps, may find the truant
    Who has left you thus alone,&mdash;
God of mercy! Yes, she sees him,
    Not among that peasant band,
Not among the squires and farmers,
    But the lord of all the land;
<!-- page 179 -->With his son and heir beside him,
    Mourning for his wedded wife,
Dreaming not the sight is crushing,
    Crushing out another life.
By the hedge side there they found her,
    Bore her to the gardener's cot;
But her pulse has ceased its beating,
    And her heart it flutters not.
To the earth a soul is given
    Heir to all its joy and care,
She herself has fled to heaven,
    Is a white-robed angel there.</p>

<p class="stanza">O, lay it down softly
    Beneath the green sod,
The casket, whence speedeth
    A spirit to God.
No friend to be watching
    The place where it sleeps;
No tears for that grave
    But such as night weeps;
The heart, it was broken,
    But God is above,
And sweet is the healing,
    The healing of love.
O, love, love, love!
    We yet shall rejoice
In the triumph of love.</p>

<p class="stanza">Treading in the steps of winter,
Budding springs have come and gone:
Come and gone, until the wee bud,
<!-- page 180 -->Taken by the good old gardener
From the hedge side, and transplanted
To adorn his humble cot,
Bloometh now a flower of sweetness
Bloometh now a winsome maiden,
Gladdening all who look upon her
With the innocence of beauty,
With the soft ethereal beauty,
That so like a dream of angels,
That so like the breath of seraphs,
Resteth on her fair young face.
William, too, has grown to manhood,
But, though heir to yonder mansion,
Though surrounded by temptation,
Yet the ever watchful spirit
Of his long since angel mother
Hath so guarded all his footsteps,
Hath so kept the spirit's portals,
That the sweet perfume of virtue,
Sweeter than the richest spices,
Than the aromatic spices,
From the unpolluted altar
Of his heart, is daily rising
Upward through the exhalations
Coming from the fetid passions
Of perverted human nature,
Till, an atmosphere of darkness,
They are hiding, almost hiding,
The pure light of love supernal,
Flowing from the throne eternal,
Up to where the blessed angels
Are a-waiting, watching, waiting
<!-- page 181 -->For some soul that openeth heavenward,&mdash;
Upward rising, a conductor,
Down which they are gliding, gliding
With the blessings the Great Father,
Through the pure in heart, is giving
To his erring, earth-born children.</p>

<p class="stanza">    As two rays of light
        Proceeding from the sun,
    As two drops of water,
        Mingling, make but one,
    As the rainbow's hues
        Are with each other blending,
    So every human soul
        Is to another tending.
    The heir of wealth and fashion
        Is turning from its glare,
    And seeking with the way flower
        His home and heart to share;
    And heart to heart hath answered,
        Have mingled into one,
    For never once she dreameth
        He is her father's son.
    But angels are watching
        Their steps from above;
    The angels are guarding
        The pathway of love;
    For nothing can hinder
        The triumph of love.</p>

<p class="stanza">The moon, new-born, a silver crescent
    Hung upon the western sky,
<!-- page 182 -->When the heart that went a wooing
    First received its heart's reply.
Twice that moon had to its fulness
    Waxed, then waned to disappear,
And again it looked in brightness
    Down upon the vernal year,&mdash;
Down upon the apple blossoms,
    Where the lovers, fond and true,
Met beneath their spreading branches,
    Met their pledges to renew,
Lingered in the air of midnight,
    Shrinking from the sad adieu.
As the lamb from wolf is hiding,
    So are they from wolfish eyes;
For their future hopes providing
    By foregoing present joys;
Hearts, as open as the sunlight,
    Forced to wear a masking face;
But the dove will hide her nestlings,
    Lest the vulture's eye should trace.
Yes, they met, and pledged, and parted,
    There beneath the moon and stars,
Linda to the humble cottage,
    William to the distant seas,
Where the proud ship in her beauty
    Rides before the swelling breeze;
But there's one who, o'er them watching,
    On their hearts is shedding peace;
One whose eye ne'er knoweth sleeping,
    One whose care can never cease;
And though with eye exulting
    The vulture marks the dove,
<!-- page 183 -->Believing he hath broken
    The shielding arm of love,
Yet Love hath still her pathway
    Beneath the throne of God;
No vulture's eye hath seen it,
    Nor lion's whelp hath trod.</p>

<p class="stanza">Apple blossoms, sweet May blossoms,
    Some have perished long ago;
Some have changed them into apples,
    Where, the green leaves peeping through,
They drink in the autumn sunlight,
    Till they turn a golden hue;
Leaves of green, and golden apples
    Hidden half from view,
When the moon is brightly shining,
    When the stars are on you smiling,
When she thinks no eye is watching,
    Then the maiden from the cottage
    Comes to you.
                From her ringlets;
    Then you keep the falling dew.
Watching, waiting for her coming,
Brighter still the stars are shining
On the pathway that is leading
To the tree with golden apples,&mdash;
On the maiden moving down it,
To that tree, with thoughtful footsteps,
Till she passeth 'neath the shadows
That its leaves to earth are casting,
Taking to themselves the moonbeams
That had else illumed the place.
<!-- page 184 -->Shadows from the green leaves falling,
While the moonbeams through them glancing
Seem like fairy hosts a dancing
    To and fro upon the grass.</p>

<p class="stanza">        On the face of the maiden
            There too is a shade,&mdash;
        The glimpse of a cloudlet
            Just ready to fly
        From the love light that shines
            In the depths of her eye;&mdash;
        'Tis the shadow of absence
            Illumined by faith;
        A rainbow, it seems,
            Overarching her path,&mdash;
        A rainbow of promise,
            A symbol, 'tis given;
        It touches the earth,
            But it reaches to heaven.</p>

<p class="stanza">    Sitting where the lights and shadows
    Chase each other to and fro,
    Thinking that no eye is watching,
    But the wolf may be a-prowling,
    When the lamb doth least suspect.
    Thinking that no eye is watching,
    While a look of holy trusting
    On her face is calmly resting,
    But the wolf her step is tracking,&mdash;
    Nearer, nearer he is coming,&mdash;
    Nearer, every moment nearer;
    Soon his fangs will be upon her,
<!-- page 185 -->    Soon his triumph will be sure.
    Sir Arnold's eyes are on the maid,
    And such the plans that he has laid,
    He hopes, before another hour,
    That he shall have her in his power,
    A victim to his cruel power.</p>

<p class="stanza">"But who are these protecting forms that came
Since last I looked, or even while I looked,&mdash;
For once I have not turned mine eyes away?""
The hoary sinner questioned with himself.
Three living forms, and yet she heeds them not;
For, see! she draweth from its resting-place
A likeness forth, then turneth to the moon,
That by its light the features she may scan;
A moment gazes, presses to her lips,
Returneth it, then turneth to her home,
But these remain; and why?</p>

<p class="stanza">                A sudden fear
Strikes like a dagger through the villain's heart;
Adread of coming ill, a shrinking from
The scroll on which, unrolled, he soon must gaze.
'Tis murdered conscience waking into life!
The fig-leaf robe from off his trembling soul
Her hand shall tear, and leave him thus to stand
A hideous form of loathsome nakedness,
The nakedness of guilt.</p>

<p class="stanza">                These still remain,
And one now slowly turns to meet his gaze.
'Tis William's self he sees. "You here?" he cried,
<!-- page 186 -->In tones that shook with fiercest rage. "You here?"&mdash;
No other word his palsied tongue could frame;
His lips, so late distort with anger's flame,
Are blanched with terror now. Beside her son
He sees the patient wife, who, years before
Had yielded up her life beneath the power,
The torturing power of his unkindness;
There, too, the blue-eyed maiden of the vale,
The long-forgotten pastime of a day,
By him forgotten,&mdash;God remembers all:
The unloved wife, the broken-hearted maid,
There side by side they stand, and on him turn
Such looks of love and pitying tenderness,
That thousand arrows, dipped in burning gall,
Had pained him less.
                He strove, but could not fly,
And e'en his eyes refused to turn away,
But looked, and looked, till all had disappeared;
Then, as the tension of his nerves gave way,
He sank to earth, nor rose till fading stars
Announced the coming morn. At her approach,
Back to his home he crept, like one accursed,&mdash;
Back to the home whence, filled with guilty hopes,
He had so late gone forth. But such is man;
So hard it is to break the bands made fast
By years and years of persevering sin;
A few short hours of troubled sleep, the light,
The cheering light of day, and face of friends,
Bring back the courage fled, unclasp the hand
Of terror wildly clutching at his heart,
And with an oath he vows that ne'er again
<!-- page 187 -->Shall phantom of the brain his plans defeat.
Mistaken man! There's one upon thy track,
Whose swift pursuit thy struggles to evade
Are vain. He seeks, and for his own will have
Thine inmost soul: each idol there set up
Shall be destroyed; his power shall batter down
Each tower of pride, defeat thy fondest hopes,
Sharpen each staff thou turnest to lean upon,
Till, stricken through and through, helpless thou fall'st
Into the arms, the ever open arms, of love.
E'en now a message waits thee that shall rend
Thy soul, e'en as the lightning rends the oak
That hath so long withstood the storms of heaven.
Thy son, thine only son, sent hence by thee,
Lest he should wed him with the lowly one,
And stain thus rest upon thine ancient house,
That son is lying in a stranger's grave!
Sent hence by thee; but God hath used thy pride,
Else he had been a victim to thy sin.</p>

<p class="stanza">        In translucent robes of amber,
            As the sun is sinking low,
        See the lovely cottage maiden
            Lightly tripping to and fro;
        "Can we tell her,
            Can we fill her heart with woe?"
        Sighed the good wife,
            As they watched her come and go.
        "She must learn it,
            And 'tis better that we tell her now,
        Than some thoughtless hand
            Should strike the blow."
<!-- page 188 -->    So they called her from her tripping
        To and fro.
    Coming in, she saw their sadness;
    At their feet knelt low;
    Knelt and listened to their tale of woe,&mdash;
    Listened with an air of absence,
    Pressed her hand upon her head,
    Sat a moment, softly murmured,
    "He will meet me as he said;"
    Rose, and went about her labors,
        With reason fled.
    And the agéd pair in silence
    Watched her come and go,
    Saw her foot had lost its lightness,
    That her eye had lost its brightness,
    From her cheek the rose had fled,
    Leaving but the lily's whiteness;
    Saw it all, and yet they spake not,
    Awed to silence by the bitter woe
    That thus could overthrow
    Proud Reason's throne, and so benumb her
    That she could not know the how,
    Or why, or even that she was laid low;
    But autumn days,
    They, one by one, have fled,
    And autumn leaves
    Are numbered with the dead,
    As thus her feet
    Their rounds accustomed tread;
    And autumn winds
    That whistled round her head,
    Or kissed the lips
<!-- page 189 -->    That still would murmur
    "He will meet me as he said;"
    These have cold and colder grown,
    Till, changed into the piercing blast,
    They chase the flying hours of winter past,
    The flying hours that seem to linger
    As we wait their last.
    The last has come and gone
    And spring is here,
    And in the maiden's eye
    New light appears;
    Her feet regain their airy lightness,
    And on her cheek of lily whiteness
    The apple blossom's tint is stealing,
    For with joy's ecstatic feeling
    She hath marked their swelling buds,
    Tokens of his coming near;
    Will their bursting fragrance
    Bring him here?
    Ah, she doubts not, and she lives
    But in faith's unquestioning bliss,
    Dead to every sense but this.</p>

<p class="stanza">    Now again the hour of even
    Marketh full the rolling year;
    Now as then the moon is sailing
    Through the azure vault of heaven;
    Now as then the stars are peeping
    Through the wealth of leaves and blossoms,
    On the couch with snow-white spread,
    On the pillow that shall never
    More be pressed by her young head;
<!-- page 190 -->    For beneath the spreading branches,
    With the moonbeams dancing round,
    There she sits in patient watching,
    There she sinks to sleep profound,
    Sinks into a dreamless slumber;
    As he promised he hath come,
    And her spirit hath gone with him
    To their far-off, final home;
    Love hath triumphed,
    Love prepares for them a home
    Where no ban of kindred blood
    Twixt the bridegroom and his bride.
    Can ever come.
    In the morning there they found her,
    With the apple blossoms round her,
    Mingling with her golden hair,
    Drifting in her neck and bosom,
    Wreathing form and arms around,
        For the angels
    Came and decked her couch of bridal,
    As she lay in sleep profound.</p>

<p class="stanza">    An agéd man,
    With grief and care oppressed,
    With snowy white beard
    Low hanging on his breast,
    Came by that morn,
    And sat him down to rest
    Close by the gardener's gate,&mdash;
    An agéd, wayworn man,
    Within whose eyes there was a look
    Of yearning earnestness,
<!-- page 191 -->    As if he sought and sought,
    But never found, and still
    Was seeking the wide world round.
    He listening sat
    To those who, gathering there,
    Talked but of her whose form
    Lay cold and still within;
    Told of her beauty, goodness, truth;
    Said she had died for love;
    Spake of her birth mysterious,
    How she was found, long years before,
    With her dead mother's form,
    The hedge beside, as she gave forth
    The first faint wail of infancy:
    To this he listened, then arose,
    And asked to look upon the dead.
    Some wondered, others led the way
    To where, in stricken loneliness,
    She lay. One look he gave,
    One groan of agony, then fell,
    So cold and still her form beside,
    They deemed he too had died; but soon
    He woke again, and wildly cried,&mdash;
"Say, did I dream, or did I see my bride,
My Mary's form, as she in beauty lay,
Ere death had snatched her from my arms away?"
Then passed his withered hand across his brow,
And sighing, said, "O, I remember now
The tale you told of a young mother's death,
The hedge beside, when first her babe drew breath;
O, say is there no sign,
No token left to tell
<!-- page 192 -->Why this, her child, should wear
The face of her I loved so well?"
They brought a ring,&mdash;" 'Tis hers!" he cried;
"It was her mother's bridal ring,
Who, dying, left it as a legacy
To our one precious child. I kept,
And placed it on her hand the day she wed;
A villain placed another there,
Then stole the one he gave, and fled;
And she went forth in search of him,
And I of her. From that sad day
To this I've searched, and now I trace
Her mother's image in her dead child's face;"
And then the wail wrung from his bitter grief,
"Why did just Heaven permit such cruel wrong?
And yet 'twas kind to give in death relief.
O, Flora, darling, thou art now at rest,
Thou and thy mother dwelling with the blest;
And this, thy lonely child, hath joined thee there,
While I remain a lonely wanderer here.
A lonely wanderer, but 'twill soon be o'er;
I have upon the earth but one wish more,
To look again on him who wronged thee so.
Hush! no, I will not curse him, no;
I told thee that I would not, years ago;
But I would look again upon his face.
O, God of love! My prayer is heard!
He comes!"
The crowd that erst had gathered close,
Now parted to the right and left, and,
Leaning on a servant's trusty arm,
Sir Arnold made his way towards the dead.
<!-- page 193 -->When he heard that they had found her
Lying where he last had seen her
On that fearful night in autumn,
A strange yearning filled his bosom
Once again to look upon her,
Ere her face was hid forever,
And thus with faltering steps he came;
And thus they met, the wronging and the wronged,
And thus he learned, that man of sin,
That she whom God had shielded
From his wolfish wiles, was his own child.
Blow after blow upon the selfish heart!
'Twill break at last,
Then Love can enter to complete her task.</p>

<p class="stanza">A few more days, and bared again the breast
Of mother earth, that to their final rest
The weary head and aching limbs
Might, now at length, be borne,&mdash;
The weary head and limbs are free from pain,
While on his couch Sir Arnold turns in vain
To woo the peace that conscience frights away,
From setting sun, e'en till the opening day,
No sweet repose for aching heart and head,
The dove of peace broods not the guilty bed.
The dove of peace! how could she linger where
The echoing tones of unforgiven wrongs,
Like murdered ghosts, are floating on the air
To fright her with her sad complaining songs?</p>

<p class="stanza">The light of life, its purest joy is love,
The souls, from out whose earthly life his hand
<!-- page 194 -->Had plucked that light, were in the spirit land,
And he so near its verge, the wall of clay
That intervened might any hour give way,&mdash;
So near its verge, that those he deemed had fled,
E'en now were hovering round his restless bed.
Should glittering knife, with a dissector's care,
The quivering nerve and artery lay bare,
While yet the life within the throbbing veins
In all its full intensity remains,
To paint the quickened agony of pain,
Should mortal tongue attempt, 'twould be in vain
But these, the wronged ones, as they lingered near,
Of his past life were whispering in his ear,
Dissecting every act with sword so keen,
That soul and spirit it could pass between,
Producing anguish, that exceeds as far
The pangs of flesh, as bright-eyed noon
Exceeds the faintest glimmerings
Of the morning star.
Is this Love's work? you ask.
Shall those who bathe in that eternal sea
Come back to fill earth's erring souls
With more than mortal agony?
Is this the work of Love?</p>

<p class="stanza">                The mighty God,
Our God himself, is love; but none the less
When his swift coursers to his thunder car
He chains with lightning links,
And rushes on to elemental strife,
Than when, with smiling sun and falling dew,
He kisses back the blushing flowers to life.
<!-- page 195 -->Within the soul there is a fountain hid,
Whose waters have the power to make
The wounded spirit whole.</p>

<p class="stanza">                This Love would reach;
But if she find that granite rocks o'erlie,
And adamantine walls surround,
May she not drill and pierce and tear,
With shivering blast, those barriers hence?</p>

<p class="stanza">O, holy Love! Thy labor is not lost;
Though for a while, like rain on burning sands,
It sinks from sight:
The final triumph, when it comes,
Shall make all earthly wrongs aright.
And come it must; for see,
The heart, the heart is reached at last,
And upward well repentant tears,
Repentant tears, hailed by those waiting ones
With greater joy than new-made sire
Ere hailed his first born's cry.
Those waiting ones,&mdash;not long they'll wait,
For full fruition's nigh. The new-born soul
A moment lingers on the shores of time,
Then passes over to their outstretched arms.
'Twas him they sought, not his,
And they have won.</p>

<p class="stanza">                O, love, love!
All conquering love! Another soul
Owning thy sway, now drinks,
And shall forever drink
<!-- page 196 -->From that unfathomed sea,
Whose waters flood creation through and through,
While maiden, wife, children, and all
Upon whose earthly hearts were laid
The keen maternal pangs that gave
It birth into thy fadeless realm,
Co-workers with the Infinite, shall share
With Him the never-ending bliss;
The never-ending bliss, but just begun,
For, as their loving arms enclose him round,
Swifter than meteor through the vaulted sky,
Upward they speed them to the eternal throne,
Where, bowing with their love-won gem,
New splendors fall upon their dazzling crowns.
While, from those congregated hosts
Of million millions multiplied
By myriad millions, and by millions still,
A myriad shining ones arise,
Till, hovering o'er them, poised upon the wing,
Their varied hues of differing glory form
A rainbow arch, on whose resplendent front
Flashes in lines of living light,
"Behold, behold love's triumph now!"
And then, as fire-flakes from love's burning sun
Fall inward on their hearts, away they speed
On kindred missions to our darkened world.
Some, as they go, seek but for single souls,
And some the pulses of a nation's heart.</p>

<p class="stanza">        With the sweet dews of peace,
        Or with the cannon's thunder,
        Which e'er they must, they'll use
<!-- page 197 -->        To burst the bands asunder,
        The bands of ignorance and wrong
        That bind us round.
        When, 'neath the dews of peace
        The clusters grow and ripen,
        When, of the coming war
        Rumors are heard to frighten,
        Or when, 'mid clashing steel,
        The wine-press trod by Love alone,
        Reaches the bridle bits in blood,
        Not then, not then the end;
        The final triumph is not yet,
        For it shall bring a world redeemed
        To deck love's jewelled crown.</p>

<p>CHARITY.</p>

<p class="small">FOUNDED ON FACTS.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="small">A WOMAN OF PRINCIPLE.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">Twenty-five</span> years ago Cleveland was not as large
as now. True; but it was large enough to contain the
rich and the poor, the oppressor and the oppressed, the
virtuous and the vicious, the time-server, and those who
sacrifice all for the <span class="smcap">Right</span>.</p>

<p class="prose">One of this latter class had just finished a day of toil,
and was preparing for the evening walk, that, when circumstances
permitted, she always took at the close of a
day's confinement to the long rows of figures in the
merchant's ledger, for even then&mdash;twenty-five years
ago&mdash;this woman was fearless enough to fill what was
called a man's position, and through the favor of one
who knew her worth, and what she had sacrificed for
principle, she held the place and received the wages of
an accountant in a store.</p>

<p class="prose">Ten years before, Marion Tracy, then but eighteen
years of age, and the petted child of wealth, became the
bride of Lorain Reid, head clerk in her father's store.
Her parents opposed their union; he was poor, and
what was worse, had imbibed the "pernicious doctrines"

<!-- page 199 -->

of the Garrisonian school. In short, he was an abolitionist;
he believed the black man had rights as well as
the white man; that slavery was not a divine institution.
This heresy so incensed Mr. Tracy, that, but for the
efficiency of young Reid, he would have dismissed him
from his employ at once.</p>

<p class="prose">The daughter, however, did not feel as did the father.
Marion listened to the eloquent words of her lover, as
he painted the wrongs of the black man, till her soul
became fired with the desire to do something towards
breaking their chains, and when, in opposition to her
father's wishes,&mdash;yea, commands,&mdash;she married the
"young fanatic," as he was called, and was banished
from her paternal roof, she went forth courageously,
believing that the right would triumph.</p>

<p class="prose">The young couple found a home in the south part of
the State, went to work hopefully, cheerfully. In due
time two lovely children, two bright-eyed girls, were
born unto them. But the black man still groaned in
chains, or fled at night through the land of boasting,
towards the land of freedom, and Mr. Reid's home
became an underground railroad depot, and himself
one of the principal conductors, till at length he so
exposed his health, in making extra exertions to save
a company of fugitives from the human bloodhounds.
that were close upon their track, that he sickened and
died. Their property was not wholly clear from incumbrance,
and the vampires of the law swooped down
upon it, used it in litigation, while the widow and the
fatherless were left destitute.</p>

<p class="prose">"I guess Mrs. Reid has had enough of abolitionism
by this time," said those who hated, while forced to

<!-- page 200 -->

admire her intrepid spirit. "Guess she'll have enough
to do to take care of herself and children, without
minding other people's business, now." "Before I'd
expose my life to save a lot of niggers!"</p>

<p class="prose">But Marion, while these cruel remarks were being made,
was watching over the sick bed of her youngest darling, for
her cup of grief was not yet full; or may we not rather
say that the husband, whose heart was so knit to hers, still
willed to share her burdens by calling one little one to
himself? So at least it seemed to the stricken mother,
for when, with outstretched arms and a glad smile little
Nellie called, "Papa! papa!" and ceased to breathe,
Marion murmured, "It is right that papa should have
one with him; he can care for thee, darling, better than
I can." So she wiped her tears, buried her dead from
sight, and people said that she had no feeling for any
body but a "nigger."</p>

<p class="prose">But Marion failed not when they looked for her to fail.
Their shafts fell harmless at her feet as she
gathered herself anew for the conflict; and those who
called her unfeeling because she wept not her strength
away, and unwomanly because she sat not down in
helpless dependence, knew not what they said,&mdash;knew
not the soul of her whom they maligned.</p>

<p class="prose">But it was not of Marion Reid's trials and victories
that I sat down to write; she is not the heroine of my
story; but even in her case we may see the lack of
"charity;" that charity, without which the great Apostle
to the Gentiles said he was nothing; we can see
even in her case how prone we are to misjudge the
motives of others. I say we; for who among us is
guiltless in this respect?</p>

<!-- page 201 -->

<p class="prose">"Mrs. Reid," said Mr. Whitney, her employer, as
Marion prepared to leave the store one evening, some
three months after she came to the Forest City, and
found employment therein sufficiently remunerative to
support herself and child comfortably,&mdash;"Mrs. Reid,
do you walk to-night?"</p>

<p class="prose">"I think I shall. It bids fair to be a beautiful sunset&mdash;just
clouds enough to make old Sol look grand as
he dips into Lake Erie."</p>

<p class="prose">"Could you not forego your sunset view and make a
call?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Where?"</p>

<p class="prose">"There is a family living in one of Simpson's houses,
a mother and three daughters, that I would like to know
something about, but I cannot visit them."</p>

<p class="prose">"Why not?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Because I am a man, and the charitable ones have
got it into their heads that they are not what they
should be."</p>

<p class="prose">Marion looked at the merchant with a curious smile.</p>

<p class="prose">"No, it is not that, Mrs. Reid. I am not a coward;
but it injures them. The eldest daughter is very, very
beautiful; and having imbibed the idea that she is not
virtuous, people seem to think that she is irresistible,
and the larger the number they imagine she brings into
her toils the greater the indignation against her; therefore,
for me to seek the acquaintance of the family would
only be to their disadvantage; but if the observation
and experience of my life so far&mdash;and I count myself
a close observer&mdash;if my past experience is worth any
thing, those women&mdash;they count the mother in with
the daughter&mdash;are innocent."</p>

<!-- page 202 -->

<p class="prose">"You spoke of three daughters."</p>

<p class="prose">"True; but the second one is only fourteen, a cripple,
and, they say, sweet and pure as an angel; while
the other is but a child yet."</p>

<p class="prose">"If the mother and oldest daughter are what you
believe them, why are they so talked about, and why
do they think the second one any better than the other?"</p>

<p class="prose">"That is what I wish to find out. No one seems to
know anything of them positively, only that the lame
one&mdash;she cannot walk without a crutch&mdash;goes frequently
to church, while the others do not; and they
say that her very look is heavenly, and that she cannot
be long for this world, and the church of which she is
a member say they pray God to take her home to himself,
that she may thus escape the contaminations of her
surroundings."</p>

<p class="prose">"She belongs to the church, then?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Yes, she was gathered in during the recent revival."</p>

<p class="prose">"Are you alone in your opinion of these people?"</p>

<p class="prose">"No; I have heard several gentlemen express the
same; but the verdict of the female portion of the community
seems unanimously against them."</p>

<p class="prose">"And so you, a man, knowing how much a woman's
character is worth, and how easily tarnished, would
advise me, a woman, to seek out these people and
form their acquaintance."</p>

<p class="prose">"Fie! fie! Mrs. Reid; you know there are some
characters that fire cannot scorch, nor water drown.
You are one of those that could walk in the midst of
pitch and not defile your garments. You surely are
not afraid to take the step I propose?"</p>

<p class="prose">"No, not afraid. If a sister woman is suffering injustice,

<!-- page 203 -->

I have sacrificed too much for the right, to be
afraid; but it seems to me that those gentlemen you
speak of, in connection with yourself, might do more
for them than one woman, single-handed, can."</p>

<p class="prose">"I tell you we can do nothing; the son of one of my
old friends, William Holden, became acquainted with
this girl, believed in her innocence, and, thinking to
vindicate her, took her to a party, and when she entered
the ball-room, every lady left it, and William has been
sent away by his father, ostensibly because his business
needed some one interested therein to take charge of it
in New York, but really that he might be beyond her
fascinations. William told me, with tears in his eyes,
the day after taking her to the ball, that he did not
believe there was a purer girl in the city than Helen
Merrill."</p>

<p class="prose">"The name is Merrill, then?"</p>

<p class="prose">"That is the name of the two eldest daughters; but
the woman's name is Taylor; she has been twice married,
I understand."</p>

<p class="prose">"You seem to know something about them, after all."</p>

<p class="prose">"Nothing more than I have told you, further than
that they lived awhile in another part of the city, in a
house belonging to a noted libertine, but a wealthy
man, and as near as I can learn, most of the stories
have originated with him."</p>

<p class="prose">"And you really believe them innocent?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Do you think I would ask you to call there if I
did not?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Why not?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Why not!"</p>

<p class="prose">"Yes, why not? If I possess the power you attribute

<!-- page 204 -->

to me, might I not possibly be a benefit to them, even
if guilty? Might I not, by showing that all hearts are
not shut against them, lead them back to the path of
virtue? Surely the mother and sister of such a one
as you have described the lame one to be cannot be
wholly depraved. If they are innocent, they <i>deserve</i>
friends, and if guilty, <i>need</i> them; and I shall most
certainly make their acquaintance."</p>

<p class="prose">"But how will you manage it? Judging from their
appearance, I should not think them very approachable;
and the proud reserve they manifest is one thing that
leads me to believe them innocent."</p>

<p class="prose">"That's just like a man; set a woman to do what
they dare not undertake themselves, and then, when
she accepts the challenge, begin to suggest difficulties."</p>

<p class="prose">"Well, well, don't laugh at me, and I will leave the
case wholly in your hands."</p>

<p class="prose">"Not till you have told me where to find them."</p>

<p class="prose">"O, I forgot that. They live in the pretty white
cottage on C&mdash;&mdash; Street, No. &mdash;&mdash;, I think it is; you
will know it by its standing back from the road all
alone, and by the elm in front."</p>

<p class="prose">"What! that little bird's nest? I have often noticed
it. Just the place for innocence to nestle in. I should
as soon think of associating heaven and hell, as guilt
with that place; but how came Simpson to build such a
residence for a tenant house? It doesn't seem a bit
like him."</p>

<p class="prose">"He did not. It belonged to a poor widow who was
unfortunate enough to become indebted to him, and
report says that he took it from her unfairly. The
poor woman grieved so at having to give up her home

<!-- page 205 -->

that she did not live long afterwards, and report further
says that since her death she has haunted the house.
It is certain that those who went there did not stay
long, till at length no one would live there. Simpson
had not been able to find a tenant for nearly a year,
before these people came, and he has tried in vain to
sell it; so, if he did come by it unjustly, it seems to be
doing him but little good."</p>

<p class="prose">"Glad of it; I wish every one who obtains property
unjustly might get as little good of it."</p>

<p class="prose">"But you do not believe in the superstitious notion
of haunted houses, Mrs. Reid?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Why not? God has more ways than one to make
the wickedness of the wicked return on their own heads.
But if I am to form the acquaintance of these people, I
must commence at once. You have interested me in
them, and I shall now pursue the investigation for my
own sake. I shall walk in that direction, find some
excuse for calling, and trust me if I don't get at the
bottom of this matter."</p>

<p class="prose">"Trust a woman for anything she undertakes."</p>

<p class="prose">"A truce to all such compliments, and good night.
I must work as well as talk."</p>

<p class="prose">"Good night, and God grant you success," murmured
the merchant, as he looked after her retreating form,
then turned again to his desk.</p>

<p class="prose">The next morning Marion was at her place as usual.</p>

<p class="prose">"Well, what success?" said Mr. Whitney, as soon
as he found opportunity to approach her on the subject
of the previous day's conversation, unheard by others.</p>

<p class="prose">"Good," was the reply.</p>

<p class="prose">"You called, then?"</p>

<!-- page 206 -->

<p class="prose">"Did I not tell you I should?"</p>

<p class="prose">"I know you did; but saying and doing are so often
two things, that I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p class="prose">"That I was a woman of words and not of deeds."</p>

<p class="prose">"Not that, but feared that you might procrastinate;
you know we are apt to put off disagreeable things."</p>

<p class="prose">"This was not disagreeable to me in the least. You
aroused my interest in those people; I thought it a pity
and shame that in a city like this, where there are so
many professed Christians, that there should be none to
defend them if innocent, or to care for their souls if
guilty. Circumstances opened the way for my calling
there, without any effort on my part, and not only that,
but gave me access to their hearts, and I mean to make
the best of the opportunity thus afforded me. It seemed
as if the hand of Providence was in it."</p>

<p class="prose">"How? In what?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Why, the little girl, the half sister that you spoke
of, had been sent by her mother to some place of an
errand. The child, a sweet girl of seven years, had by
some means become bewildered, and could not find her
way back. She was crying when I first saw her, and
upon inquiry, she told me that she was Mrs. Taylor's
girl, and lived in C&mdash;&mdash; Street, in the little house with
a big tree by the gate, but that she could not find it. I
remembered the name and the description of the place
that you gave me, and concluded this to be the child
of the woman I was seeking, and so it proved; so you
see that when we wish to do good, the angels open the
way."</p>

<p class="prose">"It would seem so; I wish, Mrs. Reid, I could feel
as you do. Your trusting faith is beautiful; but I find

<!-- page 207 -->

nothing to build a like one upon. The world, and even
the church, is so full of suspicion&mdash;there is so much
injustice and so little charity, that I feel sometimes as
if there was no God, no heaven; indeed, not anything
worth trusting in or living for."</p>

<p class="prose">"Is there not goodness, justice, and charity also?"</p>

<p class="prose">"I suppose there is, though I find so little of it. But
what do you think of those people?"</p>

<p class="prose">"I have not made up my '<i>think</i>' yet. I am an
investigating committee at present, and will report
when I have obtained sufficient evidence for such a proceeding."</p>

<p class="prose">"And I, meanwhile, must wait?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Certainly."</p>

<p class="prose">"Well, as I cannot help myself, I shall abide by
your decision."</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">THE TRACT DISTRIBUTORS.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">One</span> Sunday morning in December, 1835, the following
notice was read from the desk, occupied by the
Rev. Mr. Schoolcraft:&mdash;</p>

<br/>

<p class="prose">"The members of this church are requested to meet
in the vestry on Tuesday evening next, in order to devise
some means by which religious reading may be circulated
through every portion of the city."</p>

<br/>

<!-- page 208 -->

<p class="prose">"And now, friends," continued the reverend gentleman,
still holding the notice in his hand, "and now,
friends, nay, more than friends, brothers in the cause
of Christ, and sisters beloved, I beseech you that there
be a full attendance. Think of the importance of the
work to be performed&mdash;nothing less than to furnish
religious reading to this great and growing city. While
the enemy of souls is going about seeking whom he may
devour&mdash;while his emissaries are actively engaged in
leading souls astray&mdash;while the theatre draws its victims&mdash;while
the gambler watches for his prey&mdash;while yellow-covered
novels, filled with corruption, find their
way into the hands of our young people&mdash;while the
rumseller sends his customer staggering home to his
innocent wife and babes&mdash;and while the wiles of her
whose 'steps take hold on hell' are constantly leading
our young men into the path of destruction&mdash;while
these, all these things are being done under our very
eyes, what are we doing to stem the tide of corruption?
Nothing, comparatively nothing. To be sure, we pray,
and profess our faith in the saving efficacy of the precious
blood of Christ, but what are prayers and faith without
works! And of what avail will our professions be, if
we do not practice! I tell you, friends, that there is
something more at stake in this thing than merely the
interests of others; momentous as these may be, they
are not all, for our own eternal safety is involved
therein. Not that I would teach reliance upon works;
far be it from me; I know that salvation comes through
faith in Christ; but, friends, it must be a living faith.
We must have the spirit that was in Christ, the love
divine that constraineth us to labor for others. And

<!-- page 209 -->

besides, look at the exceeding great reward! 'He that
converteth a soul from the error of his ways, hideth a
multitude of sins.' Poor miserable sinners that we all
are, who is there that does not need such a covering!
What are a few paltry dollars, and a little time spent in
this cause, if even one soul can be saved? I propose,
brethren, to take up a collection for this purpose just
now, while the subject is fresh in our minds. Brother
Wilkins and Brother Smith, please go through the congregation,
and receive what the friends are willing to
bestow in so worthy a cause. Remember, it is to furnish
religious food to send into the highways and
hedges&mdash;not the food that perisheth, but that which
gives eternal life; not that which is to sustain these vile
bodies, but that which feeds the immortal soul; and
remember also, that 'there is he that scattereth and yet
increaseth, and he that withholdeth more than is meet,
and tendeth to poverty. The liberal soul shall be made
fat.' The choir will sing while the collection is being
taken, and then I will address you from these words,
found in First Corinthians, xiii. 13: 'And now abideth
faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of
these is charity.' And may the God of all grace help
us to practise the charity we preach."</p>

<p class="prose">Many were the comments made, during that and the
two following days, upon the piety and zeal of the
new pastor. "Surely the cause would prosper in such
hands." The collection was good, and the meeting on
Tuesday evening well attended. After due deliberation,
it was decided that the city should be divided into districts,
and the sisters, going two by two, should, as far
as possible, visit every house and every family, and

<!-- page 210 -->

leave such religious tracts as appearances indicated were
needed. Another meeting was agreed upon for the sisters
to arrange their committees, and appoint their fields
of labor. In the mean time, the brothers were to furnish
funds, purchase tracts, and give such information
as they thought beneficial in advancing the cause.</p>

<p class="prose">The minister was in earnest. Naturally of an active
temperament, with warm, strong feelings, and being
religiously educated, those feelings of course found vent
in that direction. He was full of zeal, and, like the
prophet of old, could not hold his peace; he thus became
a focus, a sort of central sun for the minds he
came into more immediate contact with, sending forth
his warm, magnetic life into theirs, quickening them to
action, till soon the church was all aglow with life.
The city, even to the very outskirts, was canvassed,
pages containing words of counsel, warning, or entreaty
were left with every family, reports were brought in,
and the time set for another general visit of the same
nature, Mr. Schoolcraft counselling in the mean time a
series of prayer meetings. "We have sown the seed,"
said he, "but God only can give the increase; let us
meet and pray for</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center">'Showers of grace divine,'</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">that our labors may not be in vain."</p>

<p class="prose">And so tri-weekly prayer meetings were appointed,
the circle of magnetic life deepened and broadened till
the rooms overflowed with anxious inquirers, even till
scores were added to the church, and amongst the number
Eloise Merrill, the cripple, and sister of the beautiful
Helen we have before spoken of.</p>

<!-- page 211 -->

<p class="prose">The child&mdash;for she was but a child as yet&mdash;had
been induced to go at first by a neighbor's daughter,
and becoming interested, the mother or Helen sometimes
accompanied her. But while Eloise was always
greeted with kindness and warmth, there was something
in the atmosphere that so chilled Mrs. Taylor and Helen
that they soon ceased entirely to attend; though loath
to deny their darling aught that could add to her happiness,
they still permitted Eloise to go, till in time
she was baptized, and became an accepted member of
the society. Sweet Eloise, innocent as an angel, she
dreamed not, as yet, of the dark suspicions that hung
around her mother and sister, and wondered why they
did not love to attend church as well as she did.</p>

<p class="prose">The time set for another exploration of the city had
expired, and again the tract distributors brought in their
reports. Some brought in goodly accounts of success,
and some said there were giant evils in the place that
could not be overcome. Some were hopeful, and some
were desponding; but we have principally to do with
the minister's mother, Mrs. Schoolcraft, who resided at
the parsonage, her son being unmarried, and a maiden
lady of some forty summers by the name of Prudence
Crowell.</p>

<p class="prose">These ladies had labored together, and, after giving
in their testimony on other points, Mrs. Schoolcraft
said, "Now, ladies, I have something very sad to tell
you," while Miss Prudence put her handkerchief to her
eyes as if to hide the tears she wished to shed. The
ladies looked up inquiringly, and Mrs. Schoolcraft continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="prose">"You know that sweet lamb of our flock, Eloise

<!-- page 212 -->

Merrill, and the dark suspicions that hang about the
conduct of her mother and sister. It is one of the mysteries
that such a lamb should dwell in the very den of
the wolf; still no one can look upon her pure, spiritual
face without feeling that she is one of God's elect, and
he will doubtless take care of her. But perhaps you
have not generally known why we believe this woman
and her eldest daughter vile; and, lest you may think
us mistaken, or lacking in charity, I will tell you:
Spending much of my time, as you know, among the
sick, last October I learned that a poor woman was
occupying an uncomfortable room on B&mdash;&mdash; Street,
with a sick child, and, further, that she was a stranger
in the city; therefore I felt it my duty to call on her.
I there found this same Mrs. Taylor, with scarcely the
comforts of life about her, and our Eloise quite sick.
I made some inquiries into her circumstances, asked if I
could be of any assistance to her, &amp;c., &amp;c., all of which
she received quite coolly, thanked me for my kindness
with a manner as proud as a queen, but thought she
could get along without aid at present. I then turned
to the little one, and she looked so sick that I really
thought she could not live, and I began to talk to her
of Jesus, when the mother interrupted me by saying
that the child was weak, and she did not wish her to be
disturbed or to have her mind excited on any subject.
'But, madam,' said I, 'this child may die, and without
the salvation that Jesus gives she is lost; she is not too
young to understand the story of the cross in its simplest
form, and if you will not yourself accept the pearl
of great price, do not withhold it from your child.' And
what do you suppose was her reply?"</p>

<!-- page 213 -->

<p class="prose">Here Miss Prudence gave a sob, and Mrs. Schoolcraft,
after pausing a moment to mark the effect of her
words, continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="prose">"It was this: 'I hope I have found the pearl of common
sense, and I tell you I will not have my child disturbed.'
I have no words, ladies, to paint my feelings
as I looked upon that apparently dying child and upon
that heartless mother. I left the house, praying that
God would have mercy upon them all."</p>

<p class="prose">"And it seems that God heard you in behalf of the
child at least," said Mrs. Deacon Barnes. "Surely we
should take courage when we remember her providential
restoration to a state of health that would admit of
her coming where she could hear the works of salvation."</p>

<p class="prose">"That we should," replied Mrs. Schoolcraft; "but to
go on with my story: In December, when we were
first appointed for the blessed work in which we are now
engaged, where do you suppose we found this woman?
In a pretty cottage owned by Stanford, one of the most
noted libertines in the city, and it was well furnished
with all that was needed to make one comfortable, and
Stanford himself had just left the house. Now, my
sisters, what could we infer from this change? For my
part there was but one conclusion that I could come to,
and I tell you it made my heart ache; but I felt that I
must do my duty, so, nerving myself for the task, I
uttered such words of warning against sin as I could
command at the moment; told them that God's love
and mercy extended to each and all; that no sin was so
great but, if repented of, would find forgiveness. But I
might just as well have talked to stones, for all the

<!-- page 214 -->

impression I could make; and were it not for the story
of Mary Magdalene, and the words of Jesus in reference 
to the woman taken in adultery, I should think
that there was no hope for such creatures. But I have
not told all yet: I left some tracts upon the table, and
as we passed through the gate I heard Mrs. Taylor say,
'Don't do that, Helen.' Sister Crowell here looked
back. The door was standing open, and she saw Helen
putting the tracts into the stove; so you see that the
daughter is even more hardened that the mother."</p>

<p class="prose">"It seems to me," said Miss Prudence, "that I could
put a stop to such doings had I the law-making power.
Why, I would shut up every woman that wouldn't behave 
herself; they should be kept in close confinement,
and not permitted to lead our sons and brothers astray.
It's a burning shame in a Christian land."</p>

<p class="prose">"And that brings me to another point," said Mrs.
Schoolcraft, "and no doubt it is the thought of what I
am now about to relate that drew the last remark from
sister Crowell. It seems that by some means the only
son of one of our most respectable citizens, though not
a member of this church, became acquainted with this
Helen Merrill, and was actually so infatuated with her
that he attempted to take her into company in spite
of her reputation. It almost broke the hearts of his
parents. Their remonstrances only made him angry,
he declaring his belief in her purity! <i>Purity!</i> when
Stanwood boasts indirectly of his success. True, he
calls no names, but he intimates plainly enough who is
intended. Finding that William would not hear to
reason, Mrs. Holden wrote to a brother in New York
city, and they managed between them to find a situation

<!-- page 215 -->

for him, in a business in which his father has some
interest, in order to get him away from this girl's influence.
Well, to-day, as we were walking along C&mdash;&mdash;
Street, a well-dressed young lady came out of a cottage
just ahead of us, and just a few steps from the gate she
dropped a letter. Miss Crowell picked it up, calling
after her at the same instant to inform her of her loss.
She turned just as we glanced at the direction. It was
Helen Merrill, and the letter was directed to William
Holden, New York city. We were too astonished to
act promptly, and, ere we had time to think, she had
reached her hand and taken it. No one was to blame,
it was all so sudden; but that letter should have been
kept and handed to his father."</p>

<p class="prose">"I felt so shocked," said Miss Prudence, "at the
thought of the disgrace of being seen speaking to such
a creature on the street, that I forgot what duty was;
and all we can do now is to inform Mr. Holden of what
we have discovered. I don't know as it is Christian-like,
but if it was my brother that she was trying her
deceitful arts upon, I really believe I should feel like
taking her life."</p>

<p class="prose">"God help us to leave vengeance in his hands," responded
Mrs. Barnes; "but it is indeed a hard duty to
keep up a feeling of Christian meekness and resignation
under all circumstances. Still we must not be disheartened;
the work goes bravely on. Our church was
never in so prosperous a condition as now. Let us
continue to pray in faith, and who knows but God may
convert even these wretched women."</p>

<p class="prose">Here a little meek-faced woman, who had not hitherto
spoken, said that she could not understand why it was

<!-- page 216 -->

that so much indignation should be expressed against
outcast women, and so little against the men who make
them so. "We talk of the outcast leading our sons
astray, and forget that somebody's sons first led her
astray. Now, ladies, I think that the virtuous women
of society are as much to blame for this state of things
as any one. You may think it a strange assertion, but
I believe it to be true."</p>

<p class="prose">"Pray explain yourself, Mrs. Blackman," said Mrs.
Schoolcraft, with dignity. "I am not aware of encouraging
vice in any form, and as to yourself, why you ought
to know as to that; the world is full of wickedness."</p>

<p class="prose">"Yes, and self-deception too," said the little woman,
with more spirit than usual, "and it becomes us to pull
the beam out of our own eyes, that we may see clearly
to pull the mote out of the eye of another. Now what
I mean is just this: we all of us look upon a man who
is guilty of sin in this respect with more leniency than
upon a woman. In the case under consideration, that
of William Holden's trying to take Helen Merrill into
society. He waited upon her to a dance not long since,
and every lady left the room, so I am told, and it was
looked upon as evidence of their purity, of their hatred
of sin; but was it?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Certainly it was!"</p>

<p class="prose">"Do you think that I would stay in the room with
such a creature?" exclaimed Miss Betsy Jones and Miss
Prudence in the same breath.</p>

<p class="prose">"I suppose not; but my informant tells me that some
two weeks afterwards another ball was held at the same
place, and nearly the same company present. Henry
Stanwood, this same libertine you have spoken of, was

<!-- page 217 -->

there, however, and not a lady left the room, or even
refused to dance with him. What had become of their
horror of vice?"</p>

<p class="prose">"These people were not Christians, Mrs. Blackman;
and I hardly think it fair to cite them as evidence of
our being at fault," said Mrs. Barnes.</p>

<p class="prose">"But the question is, do we not act upon the same
principle? Do we not shrink from these poor creatures
as from contamination, while we have scarcely a frown
for their companions in vice? Which of us would refuse,
suppose you, to treat Henry Stanwood with common
politeness?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Common politeness is due to every one, Mrs. Blackman."</p>

<p class="prose">"But do we accord it to the outcast, Mrs. Schoolcraft?"</p>

<p class="prose">"While we are in the world we cannot wholly ignore
its customs," was that lady's reply; and then, to put a
stop to further remark of the kind, added, "we wish
nothing introduced here to disturb the harmony of feeling
which should prevail in order to successful effort,
and I think such discussions unprofitable. Will the
secretary please read the minutes of the last meeting?"</p>

<p class="prose">This, of course, prevented further conversation, except
the whispered asides; but Miss Betsy Jones was heard
to say, as she glanced towards Mrs. Blackman, "Poor
thing! she is no doubt thinking of her sister; no wonder
she feels badly. It was a sad case. Susan Smith was
a pretty girl, and we all thought a good one; no one
supposed that she would turn out as she did."</p>

<p class="prose">"What, Mrs. Blackman's sister?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Why, yes; did you never hear of it? I supposed

<!-- page 218 -->

everybody knew it. She was promised in marriage to
one of the first young men in the country, when a
gentleman from the East somewhere, I forget where,
came into the place, and, attracted by Susan's beauty,
paid her particular attention. This caused trouble
between her and Winslow, she taking part with the
new lover. The stranger bringing forged references,
as it was afterwards ascertained, deceived her into a false
marriage, lived with her a few weeks, and then deserted
her. The poor girl became reckless, left her friends,
and, they say, is now a woman of the town."</p>

<p class="prose">"Well, she should have been true to her vows.
What right had she to be flirting with another? I
should have considered myself as much bound as though
I had been married; for my part I see no necessity for
such mistakes, nor do I believe there is any."</p>

<p class="prose">"Neither do I," said Miss Betsy; "but somehow I
always felt sorry for Susan."</p>

<p class="prose">The business of the meeting was soon finished; the
laborers chosen, and their field of operations for the
month assigned them, and each returned to her respective
home. Meanwhile let us look in upon another
scene. It is the Sabbath. Mrs. Reid has so far won
upon Mrs. Taylor's confidence as to draw from her a
promise of her history; "but not now," said she; "I
cannot tell you all in the presence of Eloise. I cannot
burden her young mind with the knowledge of what her
mother and sister have been accused of. I should have
left this place before now, and gone among friends, but
she has been too delicate to bear the fatigue of the
journey; the least excitement would prove fatal to her.
I have not the time to tell you now, for she has only

<!-- page 219 -->

gone for a short walk with Helen, and will be back
soon. If you will come next Sunday I can talk with
you, for Eloise will be at church, and after church she
stays for Sabbath school. Poor child! she is not really
strong enough to go, but she enjoys it so much that I
cannot deny her."</p>

<p class="prose">And so, on Sunday, the very one after the meeting
of the tract distributors last referred to, we find Mrs.
Reid at the house of Mrs. Taylor instead of at church.</p>

<p class="prose">Very wicked, no doubt, to forsake the sanctuary for
the society of one whom the world has rejected; but so
it was. Let us look in upon that home for a moment.
Helen is weeping; and Mrs. Taylor can hardly keep
back the tears that her proud spirit will not permit
to flow.</p>

<p class="prose">We will reserve the history for another chapter, only
giving here some of the conversation that followed it.</p>

<p class="prose">"I think, Mrs. Taylor, I may speak plainly to you;
you will not be offended?" said Mrs. Reid.</p>

<p class="prose">"Certainly not. I feel that you are a friend; no
Pharisaical idea of superiority, no feeling that it was
your mission to seek and convert the sinner, has led
you here time after time. You have shown none of
this, but only that genuine sympathy which one can
accept from another without a sense of degradation."</p>

<p class="prose">"I honor you, Mrs. Taylor, for your self-respect;
but still we must adapt ourselves to conditions, to things
as we find them; and do you not think if you had been
a little more yielding, not quite so proudly reserved in
reference to your own affairs, that it would have been
better?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Perhaps it might; but what right had they to intrude

<!-- page 220 -->

themselves upon me in the way that they did? It was
not the fact of their calling, but their manner that
offended me. Their every look and movement said as
plainly as words could have said it, 'You are a poor,
needy creature, that we, out of the abundance of our
goodness, have come to assist, and you should recognize
this fact, and be particularly grateful to us, and subservient
to our superior wisdom.' Bah! I understand
such Christianity as that. Surrender all you have into
its keeping,&mdash;give up your own judgment, self-respect,
and all, and then they will make you the objects of their
peculiar care, because, doing so, ministers to their self-righteousness;
but dare to be yourself&mdash;to keep your
own counsel, use your own judgment instead of theirs,&mdash;and
you might as well be in a den of tigers."</p>

<p class="prose">"What you say has too much truth in it; but it only
confirms me in my position, Mrs. Taylor. If you
really were in a den of tigers, you certainly would not
let them rend you and yours if you could prevent it by
studying and adapting yourself to their natures. Now
it seems to me that if you could have so far conquered
your pride&mdash;for I must call it pride&mdash;as to have made
some explanation of your circumstances to those people,
it seems to me that you would have had their sympathy
and protection."</p>

<p class="prose">"Yes, every shepherd watches over his own sheep,
and every merchant over his own goods; and had I permitted
them to own me, they would doubtless have cared
for me. No, I will be a free woman, and suffer the
consequences."</p>

<p class="prose">"And I," said Helen, "will sustain my mother and
suffer with her. I should scorn to see her receiving the

<!-- page 221 -->

sympathy of people who have insulted her as they did
the second time they called on us. Why, had she been
the keeper of a brothel, they could not have been more
rude to her; and then the tracts they left&mdash;those written
for the vilest of sinners. I felt like putting them out
of doors, and I did put their tracts into the stove as
soon as they left."</p>

<p class="prose">"Do you know the names of those who visited you?"
asked Mrs. Reid.</p>

<p class="prose">"I have since learned that one of them is the minister's
mother, and the other a Miss somebody&mdash;an old
maid, one of the prudish, sanctimonious ones; I should
think from her appearance that a man was her especial
horror."</p>

<p class="prose">"Don't reflect on old maids, Helen," said Mrs. Reid,
laughing; "you may be one yourself yet."</p>

<p class="prose">"And if I am I will not cry 'sour grapes,' " was the
quick retort.</p>

<p class="prose">"But in reference to those tract distributors," continued
Mrs. Reid, "they are not all the church; neither
are all like them. There are good people there&mdash;those
who would gladly be your friends if they knew how to
reach you. But the way has been hedged up; appearances
are against you; their minds have been poisoned,
and it was a duty you owed to yourself to explain the
unfortunate circumstances which have caused you to be
suspicioned. You have not done this; you have not done
yourself justice, and still you blame others for injustice.
Are you consistent?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Perhaps not; I have never looked upon the subject
in that light," was the reply. "I know I am proud, but
I am not haughty or insulting; and I cannot accept such

<!-- page 222 -->

treatment from others in a spirit of meekness, I assure
you."</p>

<p class="prose">"Eloise finds friends and kind treatment."</p>

<p class="prose">"I know she does, Mrs. Reid; but a demon right
from hell could not do otherwise than treat her kindly.
If there is an angel anywhere in the universe, she is
one; but I see her coming, and we must say nothing
further on this subject now. I feel that I shall not
keep her long, and I must protect her from sorrow as
far as possible."</p>

<p class="prose">Eloise came wearily up the walk. Helen met her at
the door, and took her in her arms.</p>

<p class="prose">"Are you tired, darling?"</p>

<p class="prose">"A little, Nellie, sister; but we had such a good time,
I wish that you could have been there. The minister
told us of Jesus taking children in his arms and blessing
them, and saying, 'Of such is the kingdom of heaven;'
and while he was talking, little Mary Gray, who died
before we left Rochester, came to me. She did, mother.
I saw her plainly, and she was so beautiful; I saw her
but a moment, but it made me so happy, and I have
felt ever since as if God and angels were all about me."</p>

<p class="prose">Helen and her mother exchanged glances, and the
mother said, "It must have been beautiful, darling.
But here is Mrs. Reid; you have not spoken to her yet."</p>

<p class="prose">"O, Mrs. Reid, I am so glad to see you; but what
do you suppose it means?"</p>

<p class="prose">"It means that God loves you, dear; but you are
weary now; would you not like to be quiet, and let me
soothe you to sleep?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Yes, I should like it so much; your hands are so
soft, and they make my head feel so good."</p>

<!-- page 223 -->

<p class="prose">"Well, lie down here and close your eyes then, for
I must go soon."</p>

<p class="prose">The child was soon fast to sleep under the magnetic
touch of her friend's fingers, and then Mrs. Reid took
her leave.</p>

<p class="prose">But few words were spoken, for a holy awe seemed
to have fallen upon each, even as if they were in the
presence of the angels that Eloise had spoken of. Yes,
they parted, and to meet very soon under circumstances
that they little dreamed of, while those who remained
pondered upon the words the child had uttered, and she
that left doing the same.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="small">MRS. TAYLOR'S STORY.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">"I was</span> the youngest child of rich parents. There
were five of us, three sons and two daughters. My
father owned one of the largest farms in &mdash;&mdash; County,
in the old Empire State, besides some city property. I
was the pet and darling of the household, and my days
passed like a summer dream. At twenty I married the
man of my choice, for some years a clerk, and afterwards
partner in the store of my mother's brother, in
the city of New York.</p>

<p class="prose">"We went to housekeeping in a pleasant cottage, that
has since been torn down to make way for the advancing
tide of business, and a splendid block of stores now

<!-- page 224 -->

stands in its place. In about fifteen months my Helen,
here, was born. She grew finely; and I doubt if there
were many happier homes anywhere than ours was.
But, alas! our sunshine did not last. True, the clouds
at first were not dark enough to obscure our heart happiness,
still they were clouds, and heavy ones.</p>

<p class="prose">"George had gone largely into business, depending
upon father to help him if he should get into a close
place. Indeed, father had encouraged him to do this;
but just as he was about to avail himself of the offer,
word came that through some unfortunate speculations,
together with a heavy indorsement for a friend who had
failed, and left the debt for him to pay, my father had
lost his splendid property, and had become a poor man.
One of my brothers came forward and saved a small
remnant of what had been so ample, but the other two
were still at home, and what little they had saved went
in the general wreck. The shock was too great for one
who had never known aught of poverty, and poor father
sank under it. Mother went to reside with the brother
before spoken of, but she tarried not long. The loss
of property, I believe, she could have borne, for she
was a woman of great fortitude, but of a deep, strong,
affectional nature; and when father left, and soon after
brother Henry was accidentally killed, under circumstances
that were particularly painful, she sank under
the accumulation of grief. It was more than her frame,
already weakened by disease and years, could bear.</p>

<p class="prose">"I thought I should go wild with grief; but I saw
that something troubled George, and I strove to be as
cheerful as possible on his account. Finally he came
to me one day and said, 'Amy, darling, I might as

<!-- page 225 -->

well tell you all. I must bring my business to a close.
I can go on no longer. I may possibly save a few
hundreds, but that will be all, and we shall have to
leave here with comparatively nothing, go into some
new place, and start anew.' 'I can bear it,' said I;
'anything, if you and the children are left me.' Eloise
was then about six months old; Helen five years.
George had struggled on two years after father's death,
and he could struggle no longer. I said that the clouds
at first were not dark enough to obscure our hearts'
happiness. They were light compared with what followed.
I loved my parents, I loved my brother; but
the love I felt for them was as nothing compared to that
I bore my husband; and looking back, all clouds seem
light compared with the one that overshadowed my life
when he was taken from me; but I anticipate.</p>

<p class="prose">"Mr. Merrill made a statement of his business to his
creditors, and told them that if they would leave things
in his hands, so that he could dispose of them without sacrifice,
they should lose nothing, or next to nothing; but
if not, there would be loss, and he could not prevent it.</p>

<p class="prose">"They trusted to his honor, and left him to dispose
of his goods at the best advantage he could. Every
creditor was satisfied, every debt was paid, and we saved
just one thousand dollars. With this money we moved
to Rochester, bought us a little home, and my husband
went to clerking again; and I tell you, Mrs. Reid, I
never was prouder of him in my life than then; for had
he not been honorable?&mdash;had he not come forth like
gold tried in the fire, with not only name but conscience
untarnished?</p>

<p class="prose">"We were happy in our new home, for I cared not

<!-- page 226 -->

for wealth, so that my husband and children were with
me; so you see that the clouds had not even yet obscured
the sunlight of our hearts. A year sped away a year
of blissful content, and then the thunderbolt fell, and the
lightning reached my heart. My husband sickened and
died, and the light went out of my life. I would have
gone too, but my children held me&mdash;my children, his
children, and for his sake I must live and care for them .
There were no debts, and George, when he bought our
little home, had it deeded to me; consequently there
was no court or law to step in and interfere with me.
It was mine, and no one could take it from me.</p>

<p class="prose">"So you see I had a home, but what should I do for
a living? How should I support myself and children?
I would sooner have died than part with them. I had
no resources but my own hands and brain, and I set to
work. I commenced taking boarders. I had some
nice things that we brought from New York, which I
sold, and bought plain, substantial ones to put in their
places. I sold my gold watch, my best jewelry, and
two of my best dresses, and also Mr. Merrill's clothes,
for I knew that if he could see me and know what I was
doing, nothing could please him better than to have all
that belonged to him used for the benefit of his family.
With the money thus obtained, together with a hundred
and twenty-five dollars that was due to him from his
employer, I put up an addition to my house, giving me
more rooms, and soon I was in a condition to take ten
boarders, and make them comfortable.</p>

<p class="prose">"Helen was in her seventh year, and Eloise about
two years old, and with the help of a small girl to wash
the dishes, and a woman to wash and do what else she

<!-- page 227 -->

could one day in a week, I did the work for ten boarders
for six months. Then, finding that I should break
down if I did not, and that I could afford it, I hired a
good strong girl to take my place, and took care of the
children, and did my sewing myself. And this I kept
up six years. I then married Mr. Taylor, the father
of my little Mary. I had been acquainted with him
about a year, he boarding with me a part of the time.
He was not willing that I should continue to toil as I
had done, so I gave up my boarders for a while, and he
supported us with labor. I say labor, for he had not
means, only his salary as head clerk. Having been
out of health a great portion of his life, he had never
married, and never accumulated property.</p>

<p class="prose">"We lived very happily together for about three years.
He was very kind, and his love and sympathy were far
better than living alone; but my trials were not ended.
At the end of that time his old disease,&mdash;that with which
he had suffered so many years, and had finally believed
cured,&mdash;came back upon him with redoubled force. He
was taken with bleeding at the lungs, and after six
months of suffering he went hence, and I was again a
widow.</p>

<p class="prose">"I went back to my old business of taking boarders,
and kept it up till some seven months since, and then,
as some of my old neighbors were going to Cincinnati
to make themselves a home, I sold my place and started
to go with them. I came as far as Cleveland, when
Eloise was taken sick, the journey proving too much
for her. I stored my things in a warehouse, renting a
single room for a month, and, taking such things as
would make her comfortable, moved into it, intending

<!-- page 228 -->

to go on as soon as she got fully rested and able to
travel. But she became very sick; and when she was
at the worst, and so weak that I knew the least excitement
might carry her off, these tract distributors came
to see me. They were not distributing tracts then; but
some one had told them of my child's sickness, and they
came, seeming fully impressed that I was an object of
charity, and would be thankful for whatever crumbs
they chose to offer.</p>

<p class="prose">"I was full of anxiety for my darling; my heart was
sore with grief lest I should lose her; and their manner
was so patronizing, it seemed to me insulting, so I don't
suppose that I was very gracious; and besides, I never
did believe in their hell-fire religion, my parents being
Universalists. They took it for granted that I was a
hardened wretch, who rejected God's mercy, and seeing
the condition Eloise was in, seemed to think it their
duty to save her if they could do nothing for me, so they
began to talk to her about dying, asking her about Jesus,
and other things of the kind, and I had absolutely to
forbid them saying anything to her, to tell them I would
not have it, ere they would desist; and then they left,
filling my ears with warnings of the wrath to come.
Eloise became so excited from the scene that I feared
for her life; but by giving her as strong an opiate as I
dared to, I at length got her quiet.</p>

<p class="prose">"And this was my first experience with those who
are now distributing religious reading through your city,
and they have been the bane of my life since."</p>

<p class="prose">"How so?" asked Mrs. Reid. "I do not see why they
should wilfully injure you."</p>

<p class="prose">"Well, wilfully or not, they have injured me by

<!-- page 229 -->

their mean, suspicious, and slanderous tongues, till I
feel sometimes that I cannot forgive them, even if God
does."</p>

<p class="prose">"Forgive us, as we forgive those that trespass
against us."</p>

<p class="prose">"True; but one cannot always feel that. I am not
like you, Mrs. Reid&mdash;I wish I was. You are the only
woman that has treated me as a Christian should since
I have been in the city. Do you believe in their three
Gods, their election, and their hell-fire?"</p>

<p class="prose">"I cannot say that I do; at least, not as these things
are generally understood."</p>

<p class="prose">"I thought not."</p>

<p class="prose">"I know many good people who do."</p>

<p class="prose">"Perhaps so," said Mrs. Taylor; while Helen asked,
"Do you not think that such a belief has a tendency to
make people hard and unfeeling towards those who differ
from them?"</p>

<p class="prose">"It may," said Mrs. Reid. "I never have thought
much upon that point; and still it must be so, for how
else can I account for the cruelty of this professedly
Christian nation towards the black race?"</p>

<p class="prose">"What else could you expect from those who believe
that God from all eternity elected some to salvation and
left others for damnation? What else could you expect
but cruelty, not only to the black race, but to all who
do not come within the pale of their sanctified circle?
But to continue my story. Eloise gained but slowly,
and I saw that she was not going to be able for some
time to stand a journey of three hundred miles by the
slow process of canal travel, so I rented a cottage on
&mdash;&mdash; Street, took my things from the warehouse, and

<!-- page 230 -->

concluded to make myself as comfortable as I could
there.</p>

<p class="prose">"I had been there about six weeks, when those
women came again, and this time they were distributing
tracts. Stanford, the owner of the house, had just been
there, and his manner had been such that we were
exceedingly annoyed thereby, so much so that I resolved
to leave as soon as the month was up. They seemed
surprised to find me there, and, feeling bitter, no doubt,
as they remembered my want of submission to them on
their previous call, came immediately to the very worst
conclusion they could possibly arrive at.</p>

<p class="prose">" 'You seem much improved in your condition since
we last met,' said the elder lady, glancing about the
room.</p>

<p class="prose">" 'My child is some better,' I replied.</p>

<p class="prose">" 'Glad to hear it; but I was not thinking of that
particularly. You seemed to be needy before, and that
was what induced us to call; we think it a Christian
duty to see that the poor do not suffer, especially when
sick. Now, however, you are well situated, with all
the comforts of life about you. To what shall we
attribute the change?'</p>

<p class="prose">" 'To what you please,' said I, for I was vexed at
their impudence. Their manner said more than their
words; still I did not dream of what they were insinuating.
I had passed through much, but my character had
remained untouched, and I never once imagined that
aught could be brought up against me in that direction.</p>

<p class="prose">" 'To what we please!' she repeated. 'We should
be very sorry to think anything wrong.' They had
already told their business, and seemed to be selecting

<!-- page 231 -->

such tracts as they thought would suit my case. 'We
should be sorry to think anything wrong, but circumstances
are against you.'</p>

<p class="prose">" 'What do you mean?' I exclaimed.</p>

<p class="prose">" 'It is plain enough what we mean. Your beautiful
daughter, and your changed circumstances, changed
from that poor, scantily furnished room to this beautiful,
well-furnished cottage, belonging to one of the worst
libertines in the city, and he leaving here just as we
came in, and with the air of one who belonged here.'</p>

<p class="prose">"I was dumb with astonishment. I do not believe I
could have spoken to save my life."</p>

<p class="prose">"And yet, a few words of explanation right here
would have saved you much trouble," said Mrs. Reid.
"We need to be wise as serpents, as well as harmless as
doves. Had you quietly told them of the mistake they
had made that you had just learned the character of
your landlord and wished to find another house, asking
them to assist you in the matter, you would have turned
the tide in your favor. Ah, Mrs. Taylor, with all your
independence of character, I find you do not understand
human nature."</p>

<p class="prose">"Not the nature of wolves in sheep's clothing, I confess,
Mrs. Reid, and I do think that these extra religious
ones are the most impudent people upon earth; and as
to doing what you speak of, I could as easily have died
as to stop to make explanations, and ask the assistance
of those who had so grossly insulted me. As I was
saying, I was struck dumb with astonishment. They
took my silence as evidence of guilt, and proceeded to
warn me of the terrible consequences of sin, and to tell
of the mercy of God that would be extended to those

<!-- page 232 -->

who turned from the error of their ways. They were
proceeding to say more, but something in my look must
have startled them, for they broke off abruptly and left.
I don't know what I should have done if they had not."</p>

<p class="prose">"They didn't forget to leave their tracts, though; but
I made short work of them," said Helen.</p>

<p class="prose">"Yes, Helen put them into the fire before the women
were fairly out of the house. I tried to check her, but
she was too excited to listen. I should like to have
looked at them, just for the sake of knowing what selections
the Pharisaical hypocrites had made."</p>

<p class="prose">"Ah, Mrs. Taylor," said Mrs. Reid, with a smile,
"you will never be happy so long as you entertain such
feelings. Bitterness of spirit is incompatible with true
peace of mind. Why not pity their weakness and self-conceit,
and let them go at that?"</p>

<p class="prose">"That we may do, Mrs. Reid, when not affected
thereby; but when we are so situated that they can
sting us to the soul, it is quite a different thing. I
know that there are not many like you, but I doubt
if even you could have borne it with perfect equanimity."</p>

<p class="prose">"Perhaps not. I have borne much, however, in my
time."</p>

<p class="prose">"Let me see this was on Monday," continued Mrs.
Taylor; "and the next evening a young man by the
name of Holden came and invited Helen to go to a
party with him the following night. She went, and
was treated in such a manner that he was obliged to
bring her home again."</p>

<p class="prose">"Where did Helen become acquainted with this young
man?" asked Mrs. Reid.</p>

<p class="prose">"O, he was one of Eloise's friends; she always attracts

<!-- page 233 -->

every one to her. He had been to Albany on business,
and came in the packet with us from Rochester to
Buffalo, and there we took the same steamer for Cleveland.
Well, the attraction between him and Eloise was
mutual; she thought there was no one like him, and
when taken sick she could not bear to have him out of
her sight for a moment. I expected to go to Cincinnati,
as I told you, and still intended to go on when we
parted with Mr. Holden at the landing. I thought the
child would be better off on the lake; but she grew worse
instead, and I was obliged to remain. Soon after we
moved into Stanford's house, Eloise, having so far recovered
that she could go out a little, the girls met their,
or rather her, old friend&mdash;for Helen had barely spoken
to him on the boat on the street, and Eloise was so delighted
that, child-like, nothing would do but that he
must go and see where we lived; thus the acquaintance
was renewed. We found that we were near neighbors.
The young man brought his sister to see us, promised
that his mother would call, and things were going on
very pleasantly till those women came around. From
that time everything was changed. The young man
went to New York city soon after, and with the exception
of an occasional letter to Helen, the acquaintance
was entirely broken off."</p>

<p class="prose">"Yes, mother," said Helen, "and the last letter I
wrote him, telling him that I was not willing to keep
up a correspondence, with his family feeling as they do&mdash;it
was last week, you know&mdash;well, I had it in my
hand, with two or three other letters, on my way to the
office, when I dropped it. I should not have known it,
only some one who was walking behind me saw it fall,

<!-- page 234 -->

and called to me. Upon turning about, I found myself
face to face with these very women."</p>

<p class="prose">"Did they read the address, think you?" asked Mrs.
Taylor.</p>

<p class="prose">"I think they did; indeed, I am certain they did;
and had they known who it was that dropped it, I don't
think they would have called to me at all. I believe,
from their looks, they would have kept it as it was, had
they had time to think before I took it."</p>

<p class="prose">"I wish they had kept it, and given it to William's
father, for then they would have known that you are
not seeking to entrap their son. Yes, I wish they had;
it would have been much better than now, for those
saints will be sure to inform the Holdens, and it will
make trouble; you see if it don't, now."</p>

<p class="prose">"You say," said Mrs. Reid, "that from the day these
women called at your house last, the pleasant relations
between your family and the Holdens ceased. What
reason have you for thinking that they had anything to
do with it? You have been complaining of them for
drawing conclusions without a proper understanding of
the facts in the case. Are you sure that you are not
running into the same error?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Helen, my daughter, are you willing that Mrs.
Reid should see the first letter Mr. Holden wrote you
after he left the city?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Certainly, mother; I will go and get it."</p>

<p class="prose">The letter was brought, and put into Mrs. Reid's
hands. There was nothing in it but what one friend
might write to another; but the portion that most particularly
interests us was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="prose">"I can never forgive myself for subjecting you to the

<!-- page 235 -->

insult you received on that never-to-be-forgotten evening.
Strong in my consciousness of your innocence,
I thought I could protect you, and make others see as I
did; but you see how miserably I failed. But I am
most vexed when I think how the reports against your
fair fame originated. I always did hate those long-faced,
sanctimonious people, who are always talking of
man's depravity and God's mercy and goodness. As
for the mercy and goodness, I can't see it, if their doctrines
are true. As I was saying, I always did hate
that class of people, for if you fail to accord to them the
certain degree of deference that they demand of you in
virtue of their saintship, they are as cruel and vindictive
as they represent God to be to the finally impenitent.
Well, my folks seemed well pleased with you till these
tract distributors came around and filled mother's ears
with a long story of <i>charitable</i> conclusions drawn from
certain facts, put together to suit themselves, to wit:
that Stanford&mdash;the old sinner&mdash;had boasted of his
'pretty bird,' and that they had found you in a miserable
room, with scarcely any furniture, the first time they
saw you, and the next time you were in that nice cottage,
with everything comfortable about you, and Stanford
just leaving the house. Now mother does not
pretend to be a Christian; but she always accords those
who do a certain amount of respect that keeps her in
favor with them, and she is particularly sensitive in
regard to the honor of her family; so when I came home
she began to upbraid me with keeping such company,
and above all for taking my innocent sister there. This
made me angry, for I had seen enough of the world to
know that you were as innocent as beautiful. Would

<!-- page 236 -->

to Heaven you were less beautiful, for then you would
not excite the envy of cross old maids and ministers'
mothers! Perhaps it is not just according to etiquette
for me to tell you this, and I would not did I not know
that you and your good mother have been cruelly
wronged, and I believe the most of it has been caused
because you would not kiss the Pope's great toe, in the
form of modern Protestantism. Yes, I became angry,
and in a spirit of defiance invited you to that party; but
Heaven knows that I would sooner have cut my right
hand off than to have taken you there had I supposed
it possible that you could be so cruelly insulted. One
thing is sure, however: I shall never see a tract distributor
without hating him."</p>

<p class="prose">This was all that had any bearing upon the subject
in hand, so I make no further quotation.</p>

<p class="prose">Mrs. Reid handed back the letter without a word of
comment, while a look of triumph from Mrs. Taylor
said as plainly as words could have spoken it, "You
see that I have evidence in the case."</p>

<p class="prose">After a moment's silence, Mrs. Taylor resumed:
"I thought my poor girl's heart was broken. She
wept incessantly for two days; but she had not borne
enough yet. On Saturday of the same week Stanford
came back. This time he did not stop at hints, but
came out boldly with his infamous proposition; offered
a price for my child; and when rejected, with indignation,
said that her character was gone now, and she
might as well be his in deed as in name; and when
peremptorily ordered from the house, left vowing vengeance.
This was on Saturday evening, and on Monday
morning, just as I was preparing to go out to

<!-- page 237 -->

look for another house, a gentleman called and asked
to look at the place, saying he understood it was for
sale. He looked over the house and yard, talked with
Eloise of the book she was reading, asked what books
she liked, and managed in one way and another to prolong
his stay, till I began to be impatient for him to
leave; still he was so gentlemanly and respectful that
I could find no excuse for dismissing him. I noticed,
however, that he was one of that class of persons who
have their eyes open; keeping boarders so long made
me somewhat observant, and I saw that he was studying
us without seeming to do so. I saw also that he had
not made known the real object of his call. At length
he said to me, 'Madam, I hope you will not consider
me intruding, but do you know the character of the
man to whom this house belongs?'</p>

<p class="prose">" 'I have recently become aware of it,' I replied.</p>

<p class="prose">" 'How?'</p>

<p class="prose">" 'In a manner that leaves no possible room for
doubt.'</p>

<p class="prose">" 'Pardon me,' said he; 'I should not have asked
you that question, but if you will permit me to be frank
with you, I will acknowledge that my excuse for calling
here this morning was a feigned one. I am bad enough,
Heaven knows, but I have never yet been guilty of
betraying innocence; and my advice to you is to leave
this house as soon as possible. Reports are in circulation
prejudicial to you; but they don't deceive Ben Wilson.
I have seen enough of the world to be a good
judge of character, and I know that you do not deserve
the name they give you. I called for the purpose of
learning for myself whether these things were so. I

<!-- page 238 -->

am satisfied that they are not; but Stanford is utterly
destitute of principle. I know him of old. He is not
only a libertine, but a malicious, vengeful one. He
seems to have an especial spite towards those he takes
a fancy to, if they hold out against him. I have known
of more than one poor girl who has been made desperate,
and at last fallen into his power, through reports
that he first set in circulation against her. I tell you
he will stop at nothing; therefore I advise you to leave
this house as quickly and as quietly as possible.'</p>

<p class="prose">" 'Thank you, sir,' said I, 'for your advice, but it is
uncalled for. I was just preparing to go out on that
very errand.'</p>

<p class="prose">"He seemed confused at the promptness and quietness
of my reply, but rallying therefrom said, 'Madam,
I know I am a villain for intruding myself upon you,
and especially as I acknowledge the motive was not a
good one; but when I learned my mistake, I desired to
make all the recompense in my power for ever daring to
think ill of you; and now I most humbly ask your pardon,
and hope, for the sake of that sweet child,&mdash;turning
to Eloise, who had been absent during the latter part
of the conversation, and now re-entered the room,&mdash;I
hope, for the sake of this child, that you will permit
me to be your friend, for I feel that I can learn lessons
of virtue from her innocent face.'</p>

<p class="prose">" 'The past is forgotten,' I replied, touched by the
earnestness of his manner, 'and the future depends upon
yourself.'</p>

<p class="prose">" 'Thanks, a thousand thanks, madam; I will see that
you have no cause of complaint,' said he, bowing himself
out. I then started on my tour of house hunting,

<!-- page 239 -->

and succeeded in finding this little cottage, where I have
since lived in peace.</p>

<p class="prose">"It being near the church, Eloise can go to Sabbath
school, and sometimes to church once a day. Helen
and I do not go, for, as I was saying, the minister's
mother is one of those who made me so much trouble,
though they say he is a good man. As warm weather
comes on, Eloise seems better, and I hope after a little
to be able to leave the place. Warm weather always
seemed to agree with her better than cold, and that is
one reason why I left Rochester last autumn. I knew
that the climate was milder in Cincinnati than there;
but, poor child, she was not strong enough to go
through, and so I was obliged to remain here. Could
I have known how it would be, I should have staid
where I was."</p>

<p class="prose">"Do you ever hear anything from the gentleman you
last spoke of,&mdash;the one who advised you to leave Stanford's
house?" asked Mrs. Reid.</p>

<p class="prose">"He calls occasionally, and brings Eloise books to
read. He seems kind-hearted and respectful; but I do
not encourage him, and so he comes but seldom. I
should not permit him to come at all but for her sake.
But the child is lonely; she has not been used to so
retired a life, and she hails his visits with delight. Then
he always brings her something to read, and his selections
are excellent."</p>

<p class="prose">And here comes in the conversation related in the last
chapter, when the return of Eloise puts a stop thereto,
and Mrs. Reid, after having soothed her to sleep, returns
home.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="small">FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS OF CHARITY.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Reid</span> had been trying to induce Helen and her
mother to go to church with her, and at length succeeded
in obtaining a promise that they would go on the Wednesday
evening following the Sunday that she had spent
at their house. Eloise was so much better than usual
that for the first time she was permitted to go out at
night, and together they entered the well-filled church
and listened to a fine discourse from the Rev. Mr.
Schoolcraft, given especially to the young, and more
particularly to the young converts who had recently
been gathered into the fold.</p>

<p class="prose">He painted in glowing colors the snares that beset the
feet of the young, and especially the young men of our
large cities. "Daughters," said he, "are more particularly
under the eye of the mother; but our young men
go forth to breast the storms of life, and the seductions
of vice meet them on every side; bright eyes and
sparkling wine, and all the allurements that appeal to
the senses; and while all need the grace of God, surely
our young men need it in an especial manner, if they
would keep their feet from falling and their souls from
sin."</p>

<p class="prose">William Holden's mother and sister were there, but
they brushed by our little company in haughty silence;
and Mrs. Reid noticed that whenever the minister spoke

<!-- page 241 -->

of the temptations that beset young men, scores of eyes
were directed towards where they sat.</p>

<p class="prose">"I never realized," said she, to Mr. Whitney, the
next day, "what it was to be under the ban before. It
made me sick and faint. I do not wonder that the outcast
is seldom, if ever, reclaimed; the manner in which
society meets them is enough to sink them to the lowest
hell of degradation. Why, I would not go through
another such ordeal as that of last night for anything;
that is, nothing but a sense of duty or the hope of doing
good could induce me thereto. It is worse than working
for the slave."</p>

<p class="prose">"You believe them innocent, do you not?" he asked.</p>

<p class="prose">"I do."</p>

<p class="prose">"And you yourself was acting under a sense of duty,
or rather a desire to do good?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Most certainly I was."</p>

<p class="prose">"Then you have not half estimated the difficulties
under which the outcast lies; for instead of conscious
innocence and a noble purpose to sustain them, they
have the added load of guilt to bear."</p>

<p class="prose">"Yes; and God help them, for man will not."</p>

<p class="prose">"Rather say, woman will not; for if ever so innocent,
and they get the reputation of being otherwise, the more
a man tries to do for them the more it injures them."</p>

<p class="prose">"But woman does not pull them down; she only puts
her foot on them after they are down, or are supposed
to be," replied Mrs. Reid, with some spirit.</p>

<p class="prose">"Woman is sometimes man's most efficient aid in
dragging woman down, Mrs. Reid," answered Mr.
Whitney.</p>

<p class="prose">"Not till she has herself been first degraded by him.

<!-- page 242 -->

I know that woman is cowardly, and sometimes cruel to
her own sex; but her reputation is her all, and she
knows it. Were she treated as leniently as man is, even
by your sex, it would be different; but with the man is
power; he controls the whole machinery of society; can
do about as he pleases, consequently can afford to be
generous. When your sex pleads superiority over us in
that respect, it makes me think of the generosity of the
southern chivalry, compared to that of the northern
laborer. One is called whole-souled and generous, because
another earns his money for him, and he hardly
knows how he gets it; the other, close and small in his
dealings, because having every dollar to earn by the
sweat of his own brow, he knows just how it comes.
Reputation, virtue, as the world styles virtue, is cheap
to you, but to us it is not. The old adage expresses it
correctly; I remember reading it in the old-fashioned
spelling-book, so long ago as when I first learned to
read: 'Man tarnishes his character and brightens it
again, but if woman chance to swerve from the strictest
rules of virtue,</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"Ruin ensues, reproach and endless shame;
One false step forever blasts her fame;
In vain the loss she may deplore,
In vain look back to what she was before,
She sets like stars that fall to rise no more." '</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">With this state of things to contend with, I think it
hardly fair for man to boast of his lenity, when compared
with that of woman. Why, the highest men in
the nation, many of them, are guilty of that which, had
a woman been guilty of the same, she would have been
sent to Five Points instead of Congress."</p>

<!-- page 243 -->

<p class="prose">"Hold, hold, Mrs. Reid, and I will give up beat!"
said Mr. Whitney, laughing. "Your arguments are
just, and I only wish there were thousands like you, to
advocate the cause of your sex."</p>

<p class="prose">When Mrs. Reid returned home at night, she found
the minister's mother, Mrs. Schoolcraft, waiting for her;
and after the usual salutations were over, the lady
began:&mdash;</p>

<p class="prose">"I called, Mrs. Reid, to see what your idea was in
coming to church last night with those women?"</p>

<p class="prose">"What my idea was? Why, I supposed you held
your meetings on purpose for people to attend; and I
think it the duty of a Christian woman to ask her neighbors
to go with her to the house of God."</p>

<p class="prose">"And so it is our duty to encourage the humble penitent,
wherever found; but there is a limit to all things.
There comes a time, the Bible says, when even the
Spirit, God's Holy Spirit, ceases to strive with the
rebellious."</p>

<p class="prose">"Have we a right, Mrs. Schoolcraft, even if this be
true, to decide when it has taken place?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Perhaps not; still we have our reason, and must
judge something from appearances; and these women
seem perfectly hardened; their conduct is shameless,
and it is a disgrace for any decent woman to be seen in
their company."</p>

<p class="prose">"Had you seen them weep, as I have, you would
hardly call them hardened; and what have they done,
Mrs. Schoolcraft, to merit the appellation of shameless?"</p>

<p class="prose">"What have they done! Why, isn't it well known
that Stanford, one of the worst libertines in the city,

<!-- page 244 -->

kept them for a while, and then becoming offended with
him, or he with them, I don't know which, they took
up with Ben Wilson, a man of the same stamp, only
he has no family to be disgraced thereby! They stole
away from the cottage that Stanford provided for them
the very next day after Ben first visited them, and have
kept themselves so sly that he never knew where they
were till yesterday."</p>

<p class="prose">"How did you learn that?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Mrs. Holden told me last evening. Stanford told
her husband so yesterday."</p>

<p class="prose">"And how did he happen to learn where they were at
last?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Why, you see, Holden's folks have a son, who is
perfectly infatuated with this girl; she has made him
believe that she is purity itself; she evidently designed
to entrap him into marriage. They sent him to Mrs.
Holden's brother's in New York city, in order to break
up their acquaintance; and now it is ascertained that
they are corresponding."</p>

<p class="prose">"How did they learn this?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Well, you see, sister Crowell and myself were out
distributing tracts last week, and we saw a lady just
ahead of us drop a letter. We called to her, to let her
know of her loss; picking up the letter at the same
moment, we found that it was addressed to William
Holden, and as the person turned to take it, we saw
that it was this very Helen Merrill. It seemed providential,
for now Holden's people will be on their guard."</p>

<p class="prose">"And so you told Holden's people?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Certainly; I thought it my duty."</p>

<p class="prose">"Would it not have been more providential had you

<!-- page 245 -->

kept the letter and given it to them? They would then
have known just what the girl was writing."</p>

<p class="prose">"I should have done so had I thought quick enough;
but as it was, I could only inform them what I had
discovered."</p>

<p class="prose">"And where they lived," continued Mrs. Reid, with
an imperturbable coolness that somewhat disconcerted
her visitor, in spite of herself.</p>

<p class="prose">"Yes, I told them where I saw Helen go in soon
after."</p>

<p class="prose">"And was that the way that Stanford found out?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Through the Holdens? Yes. Holden himself is a
rough, good-natured sort of man, and meeting Stanford
yesterday&mdash;he says he loves to tease the old scamp&mdash;well,
meeting him yesterday, he says to him, 'Hello,
Stanf, have you found your women yet?' 'What
women do you mean?' he replied. Now this is what
Holden told his wife, and she told me last night. She
would not have thought of it, probably, had she not
seen them at church. 'What women do I mean? Now
only hear the man,' said Holden; 'he has so many he
don't know who I mean. Why, the pretty widow, with
her still prettier daughter, who slipped away so quietly.'
'What! the one your William was after? Ha ha! it
was a rich joke to hear the boy rave about her innocence.
No, I have not found them, neither do I care
to; I have had all of their company I want.' 'What,
both mother and daughter?' said Holden. 'Yes, both,'
replied Stanford; 'I don't want anything more of them;
but where has Ben stowed them away? I understand
he has them now.' There, Mrs. Reid, what do you
think of that? Isn't it horrible to have such characters
around?"</p>

<!-- page 246 -->

<p class="prose">"If you mean such men as Stanford, I say yes. I
think it horrible that such men should be allowed to run
at large, and more especially that a Christian woman
should take aught that such a wretch can say as evidence
against any one."</p>

<p class="prose">"What do you mean, Mrs. Reid? Do you intend
that as a reflection on me?"</p>

<p class="prose">"I mean just what I say. I am astonished at hearing
a Christian woman repeat the slurs of so vile a
wretch in evidence against one of her own sex, and as
for Mrs. Taylor and her daughter, I believe them pure,
so far as what they are accused of is concerned, notwithstanding 
all that has been said against them."</p>

<p class="prose">"Why, Mrs. Reid!"</p>

<p class="prose">"I do, Mrs. Schoolcraft, and am prepared to give my
reasons; but first let me give you a little of my own
experience as to the maliciousness of unprincipled men.
You know that I am rather independent in my nature,
advocate what I think is right, whether others think so
or not."</p>

<p class="prose">"I know that you have suffered and sacrificed much
in the cause of the poor slave, and I honor you for it.
Would to Heaven that all our women were as earnest in
this matter; the curse of slavery would soon be swept
from our land."</p>

<p class="prose">"That is true, Mrs. Schoolcraft; were all the women
in our land to unite in any one cause, they could make
their influence so felt as to accomplish the desired object.
But there are other slaveries than that of the black man.
Woman is herself a slave, and if she dare to go contrary
to the established usages of society, no matter how
innocent and praiseworthy her object may be, she is

<!-- page 247 -->

soon made to feel her chains. Soon after Mr. Reid's
death, I accepted an agency that required me to travel.
I was poor. He had devoted his life to the cause of the
oppressed, and we were left without means. Woman's
employments are anything but remunerative, and I felt
it my duty and privilege, if I could, to do something
by means of which I could earn enough to support and
educate my remaining child comfortably, so I took a
step somewhat, or I might say entirely out of the ordinary
track in which woman is accustomed to travel. I
said I accepted an agency; I should have said solicited,
and with difficulty obtained the position. Stopping to
canvass a little village in the central part of the State,
I boarded a few days at the public house, and one night
at the table the anti-slavery question was introduced, I,
of course, defending the abolitionist. The landlord also
kept a store in a small way, and it so happened that the
man whose business it was to furnish the country merchants
with ready-made men's wear, from a wholesale
clothing establishment in the city, was there that night.
He was very warm in his opposition to me, and became
somewhat excited when some of his arguments were too
readily answered to suit him. Some three months afterwards 
he chanced to come to another village where I
was stopping, and learning that I was there, he took
occasion to have his petty revenge. 'Mrs. Reid?' said
he, with a contemptuous sneer; 'I know all about that
Mrs. Reid that I wish to.' The conclusion of those
who heard him was that I was a vile woman, and the
report went through the village like wildfire; and had I
kept a proud silence, as Mrs. Taylor has done, I have
no doubt that I should have been driven from the place;

<!-- page 248 -->

but a little prompt action, and the forcing of the gentleman
to an explanation of what he meant, by the means
of the strong arm of the law, soon put a different
aspect to affairs."</p>

<p class="prose">"And were you really strong enough to face such an
accusation and defend yourself?" asked the minister's
mother, in astonishment.</p>

<p class="prose">"To be sure I was. Why should I not defend myself
as well as another? I should stand by another to
the last, if I thought them wronged; and for my child's
sake, if not for my own, it was my duty to do myself
justice. Besides, it taught that man and that community
a lesson, and should another woman go there,
intent upon her own honest business, they will be a
little more careful how they listen to or circulate reports
against her. So you see that I not only defended myself, 
but left my footprints there,&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">'Footprints, that, perhaps another,
    Sailing o'er life's solemn main,
A forlorn and shipwrecked <i>sister</i>,
    Seeing, shall take heart again.'</p>

</div>

<p class="prose">" 'I know all about that Mrs. Reid I wish to.' These
were the words the man used, and the community pays
him just the compliment he wishes them to, to wit;
that he is a sensual man, and therefore the only interpretation
that can be put upon such an expression is
that the person alluded to is vile. I have no doubt that
many a vile man can say of a virtuous woman that he
knows all about her he wishes to, simply because of her
being virtuous, and consequently of no use to him."</p>

<p class="prose">"Mrs. Reid, you ought to have been a preacher."</p>

<!-- page 249 -->

<p class="prose">"Perhaps so; and yet it would be contrary to Paul's
instructions."</p>

<p class="prose">"Well, a lawyer, then."</p>

<p class="prose">"I think the day will come when women will preach
and plead law too; but let me give you a little more
of my experience. I went to one place where people
seemed quite shy of me at first, but after a while I
gained their confidence, and things worked so pleasantly
that I staid several weeks. One day my landlady
said to me, 'Mrs. Reid, were you acquainted with
a family of Johnsons when you came here?'</p>

<p class="prose">" 'In this place, do you mean?' I asked.</p>

<p class="prose">" 'Yes.'</p>

<p class="prose">" 'No, ma'am; I know no one here but Mr. Peircy.
I met him at his brother's, in Monktown, and it was
through his influence that I came; but I have met a
Johnson somewhere in this place, and I cannot recollect
where. O, I know now; it was at Mr. Warner's, the
other evening.'</p>

<p class="prose">" 'That is not the one I mean,' she replied; 'he is
Mr. Warner's brother-in-law, and a very fine man; but
there is a family of Johnsons living opposite to where
the old tavern was kept. They are very low people,
the woman especially; and when you first came here it
was reported that you met him on the corner near
Burke's store, and talked with him half an hour, and
the conclusion was that you were old acquaintances;
but as I have seen nothing to find fault with in you, I
concluded it must be a mistake.' And now, Mrs.
Schoolcraft, what do you suppose that story was
started from?"</p>

<p class="prose">"I am sure I cannot tell. Some of your eccentricities,

<!-- page 250 -->

I suppose; something like your going with those
women to church last night."</p>

<p class="prose">"Well, all I could ever find it started from, was this:
The first day I went into the place, after getting a little
warm, I went to the post-office for my letters, as I had
ordered some directed there. The directions were given
me where to go, but I got a little confused, turned the
wrong corner, and stopped at the place the lady named,
that is, by Burke's store, and inquired the way of some
one who stood there. He stepped just around the corner,
and pointed out the place I sought. I did not then
know, and perhaps never should have known who he
was, had not the landlady's question, and the story she
told me in reference to it, led me to make some inquiries,
and I learned that that man was the Johnson referred
to. I might tell you several more incidents, Mrs.
Schoolcraft, to illustrate the question in point, to wit,
the unreliability of these flying reports; but these will
be sufficient, and such experiences have taught me a
valuable lesson; consequently I never judge till I have
heard both sides of the story&mdash;particularly where a
woman's reputation is concerned. What would you
think, madam, of a judge who should listen to the
evidence against a prisoner, and then remand him for
punishment without hearing the defence?"</p>

<p class="prose">"I should call him a very unjust judge, Mrs. Reid;
but I see what you are aiming at, and I think it hardly
fair for you to make me condemn myself. You think I
have judged Mrs. Taylor and her daughter without hearing
the other side of the question."</p>

<p class="prose">"Well, have you not?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Perhaps I have; but I have not intended to be

<!-- page 251 -->

unjust, and where was I to go for evidence? A woman
as vile as circumstances compel me to believe that she
is, would hardly stop at a falsehood when necessary."</p>

<p class="prose">"Suppose we dissect some of those circumstances, and
then see if you will feel compelled to believe as you have
done. In the first place, you found her with a sick
child, in a poorly furnished room, and you concluded
from that circumstance that she was very destitute."</p>

<p class="prose">"Who told you this?"</p>

<p class="prose">"She told me herself."</p>

<p class="prose">"How did she learn what my inferences were?"</p>

<p class="prose">"From a letter that William Holden wrote Helen."</p>

<p class="prose">"Did you read the letter?"</p>

<p class="prose">"I did; and he accuses you of being the first one to
make trouble between his family and them."</p>

<p class="prose">"Me!"</p>

<p class="prose">"Yes; he says that you and Miss Crowell came and
poisoned the minds of his parents and sister by the inferences
that you drew from circumstances, and he feels
very bitter towards you for it."</p>

<p class="prose">"Better feel bitter towards me than to be drawn into
a snare&mdash;to take a step that he would always regret."</p>

<p class="prose">"Well, as I was saying, you inferred from what you
saw that she was poor, and she tells me that she sold
her house in Rochester for fifteen hundred dollars, besides
some money that she got for extra furniture, such as
she did not wish to bring with her. She started to go
to Cincinnati, but the sickness of Eloise prevented her
going on with her friends, but as she hoped to proceed
in a few days, she did not wish to bring all of her things
from the warehouse. It became too cold for her to
travel ere the child became better; she then rented a

<!-- page 252 -->

house, and decided to stay till spring, and then she, of
course, had her furniture brought up and put into it.
The fact of her leasing a house of a bad man was simply
her misfortune, not her fault."</p>

<p class="prose">"And do you believe the story she tells?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Why not?"</p>

<p class="prose">"It may be true, Mrs. Reid&mdash;I hope it is. I am
sorry to believe evil of any one; but people think that
she has told this to cover her conduct."</p>

<p class="prose">"I know it to be true so far as the furniture is concerned,
for I have been to the warehouse, examined the
books, and find names and dates just as she told me;
find that she did leave her things there for a time, and
that she took them away just when she told me she
did."</p>

<p class="prose">"Well, you are a wonderful woman, I must say.
Who but you would have thought of taking such a
course?"</p>

<p class="prose">"I am sure any one ought, before taking upon hearsay
that which, if true, destroys the reputation of a fellow
creature; and true or false, the effects are the same, so
long as believed to be true."</p>

<p class="prose">"But why did she not tell us this when we called?
We would have been glad to assist her, but she repelled
us."</p>

<p class="prose">"Mrs. Taylor is a proud woman, naturally reserved,
and does not give her confidence readily; and the very
fact of your believing her destitute made your offers of
assistance offensive, in that your manner touched her
pride."</p>

<p class="prose">"Yes, pride is pretty sure to bring trouble. I consider
it one of the deadly sins."</p>

<!-- page 253 -->

<p class="prose">"And yet, Mrs. Schoolcraft, we are none of us free
from it."</p>

<p class="prose">"I know we are all miserable sinners before God,
and so much the more need that we should be humble;
for my part, I can't see why our offers of assistance
should offend the woman."</p>

<p class="prose">"It ought not to have done so, but it did; some people
are very sensitive on this point, and nothing touches
them quicker than being considered objects of charity.
I presume we all have our weak points. Besides, her
child was very sick, and her anxiety a mother's
anxiety&mdash;might well be pardoned for forgetting to be
as social as at another time."</p>

<p class="prose">"Yes, the child was very sick, poor lamb! I feared
she would never be any better; but God has willed it
otherwise; but when I attempted to talk to her of Jesus
and heaven, the mother peremptorily forbade it; and
how could I believe her other than a wicked woman?"</p>

<p class="prose">"She did this because she feared that if the child was
excited it would make her worse; and besides, she has
been brought up a Universalist, and does not see these
things as you do. She had no fears for the child's
future, and did not wish her disturbed."</p>

<p class="prose">"Yes, and that is enough to condemn her; a person
who believes in no future punishment, thinks that the
sinner goes to heaven as well as the saint&mdash;how can
we expect such to be good? For my part, I think
those who teach such doctrines should be indicted as
destroyers of the public morals, and kept in confinement."</p>

<p class="prose">"And doubtless they would, were all of your opinion;
but we live in a country of religious freedom,
and such things are not allowed."</p>

<!-- page 254 -->

<p class="prose">"Why, you don't believe such teachings right, Mrs.
Reid?"</p>

<p class="prose">"I do not believe the sinner goes unpunished; but I
have had some acquaintance with the Universalists, and
I do not find them so much worse than other people.
My grandfather, on my mother's side, was a Universalist,
and an excellent man."</p>

<p class="prose">"Well, it may be so; but for my part, I can't
see how any one can believe such a doctrine and
be good. I can't believe, after all you have said,
that these women are good; we cannot all have been
so mistaken."</p>

<p class="prose">"They must have grown bad very suddenly then;
they were considered good people when they left
Rochester."</p>

<p class="prose">"How do you know that?"</p>

<p class="prose">"I have written and ascertained. I received two
letters from there this morning, and they corroborate
what Mrs. Taylor and Helen have told me at different
times, and speak of the family in terms of the highest
respect."</p>

<p class="prose">Mrs. Schoolcraft was confounded. She looked at
Mrs. Reid as if she had no power to utter another word.
She managed at length, however, to ask,&mdash;</p>

<p class="prose">"Does Mrs. Taylor know of this?"</p>

<p class="prose">"She does not; neither does she know that I went to
the warehouse and ascertained the facts in reference to
that; but I intend next Sabbath to have these letters
read in church, as an especial piece of good news, and
I have no doubt that you will all hasten to undo the
wrong that has been unwittingly done to this family."</p>

<p class="prose">"Why, Mrs. Reid, you will not do that!"</p>

<!-- page 255 -->

<p class="prose">"Why not? The wrong has been a public one, and
why not make restitution publicly?"</p>

<p class="prose">"Perhaps you are right; but I must go home, it is
getting late. Good night, Mrs. Reid," and the lady
left, evidently more chagrined at being found mistaken,
than rejoiced at learning that a sister woman was innocent
of the great crimes imputed to her.</p>

<div class="center" id="b81c5">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="small">THE FINALE.</p>

</div>

<p class="prose"><span class="smcap">Eloise</span> had never seemed better since they left Rochester.
Mrs. Taylor and Helen were joyful in their anticipation
of soon leaving the place that had been to them
the scene of such bitter experiences. The month was
up the following Monday, and then they would start for
the city of their original destination.</p>

<p class="prose">'Twas thus they talked and planned on that very evening
in which the conversation above related had occurred
at the house of Mrs. Reid. 'Twas thus they talked and
planned, but they saw not the storm that was approaching.
They had lived so quietly, minded their own
business so thoroughly, that their immediate neighbors
scarcely knew of their existence. Good Mr. Whitney
had accidentally learned their place of abode, after leaving
Stanford's cottage, but had said nothing further than
what we have already related of his conversation with

<!-- page 256 -->

Mrs. Reid, and had it not been for those women with
their tracts, they could have left the city in peace.</p>

<p class="prose">These charitable souls, however, were so filled with
righteous indignation that they could not restrain their
tongues from utterance, and so they horrified the good
people of the place with the information that they
had a vile woman, or rather two of them, in their
midst.</p>

<p class="prose">The story of young Holden was repeated with variations,
till every mother looked upon her son as devoted
to certain ruin if these creatures remained in the place.</p>

<p class="prose">Husbands and sons laughed at their fears, but this
only exasperated them the more. Groups were seen
conversing here and there, anxiously asking what should
be done. They supposed there were such women down
in the heart of the city, but that they should come into
the suburbs, and settle down among decent people, was
altogether too much to be borne.</p>

<p class="prose">Stanford, who had panted for revenge ever since he
was so summarily dismissed from their presence, sent
one of his female friends up into the neighborhood, in
order to spy out and report. On returning to him with
an account of the excitement people were in, he hired
her to go back and represent herself as a great sufferer
on account of Mrs. Taylor and her daughter; they having
decoyed both her husband and son by their snares.
And this woman, once virtuous and good, but who had
fallen a victim to Stanford's too well-laid plans, and,
losing all self-respect, had since become the agent of
his will, actually performed the part assigned her so
well, that a company of quiet, well-to-do wives and
mothers were raised to that pitch of excitement that they

<!-- page 257 -->

went to Mrs. Taylor's house and pelted it with stones
and rotten eggs.</p>

<p class="prose">And while the inmates were trembling with fear,
Eloise having fainted from terror, the police descended
upon them and took the whole family to the station
house, to answer to the charge of disturbing the peace.
It was too late that night to investigate the matter, consequently 
they must remain in custody till morning.</p>

<p class="prose">"This is the work of those Christian women who
have followed us with their persecutions ever since we
came to the city; and may God reward them accordingly,"
said Mrs. Taylor, in the bitterness of her spirit.
Helen was silent, and the wretched mother continued:
"Yes, may God reward them accordingly; they are
murderers! they have killed my child. Eloise will
never recover from this."</p>

<p class="prose">"O, mother, don't say that," fairly shrieked Helen,
while sobs shook her entire frame.</p>

<p class="prose">"Don't cry, sister," murmured Eloise, faintly; "I
shall soon be better."</p>

<p class="prose">Every sign of emotion was suppressed almost instantly.
They could do anything for her dear sake.
They had believed her unconscious, and finding that she
was not, they grew calm in a moment, while Helen,
stooping and kissing her, replied, with a smile, "Yes,
darling, you will soon be better."</p>

<p class="prose">"Thank you, sister; now don't cry any more; God
and the angels will make it all right. Kiss me, mother;
I am tired and want to sleep;" and with her head pillowed
upon her mother's breast, she sank away into a
condition of unconsciousness, that seemed more like
death than sleep. Little Mary lay in one corner of the

<!-- page 258 -->

room on a temporary bed that had been prepared for
her. She had cried bitterly at first because she could
not have her own bed; but childhood soon forgets, and
now she was sleeping soundly.</p>

<p class="prose">But there was no sleep for Helen or her mother. All
night long they watched over the pale sufferer, and
when morning dawned, the mother knew that it would
soon be over. The mother knew this, but Helen could
not, would not admit the terrible truth; she could not
give up her darling sister.</p>

<p class="prose">When the hour arrived for the keepers of the peace
to look into the cause of the previous night's disturbance,
not an accuser was there; but Stanford was on
hand, and with a hypocritical smile, stepped forward
and offered to go security for the ladies, and pay all
costs if they could be set at liberty.</p>

<p class="prose">"I have no doubt," said he, with an insulting look
towards them, "that they have their friends; but I have
never found them inclined to make trouble, and I think
the excitement of last night was wholly uncalled for."</p>

<p class="prose">"Hold, wretch!" exclaimed Mrs. Taylor, with flashing
eyes; "wretch! hypocrite! You have caused this,
and you know it; and you think by this means to
accomplish what you have failed to do otherwise. I
will not accept your offer. I would rather rot in
prison than to fall into your power."</p>

<p class="prose">"Come, come, now!" he replied, with the same
smooth smile, "it isn't worth while to hold anger; perhaps
I have neglected you, but I am willing to make
all right, and I can't bear to see you here."</p>

<p class="prose">"Great Heaven," murmured the wretched woman,
"will no one protect me from these insults?"</p>

<!-- page 259 -->

<p class="prose">"Here comes one who will protect you, no doubt,"
said Stanford, with a sneer, as Ben Wilson appeared on
the scene.</p>

<p class="prose">"Yes, I will protect them with my life if necessary,"
he replied. "Sir," he continued, turning to the officer
in charge, "I demand the instant release of this family;
there are not two better, purer ladies in the whole city."</p>

<p class="prose">"Very devoted lover," sneered Stanford.</p>

<p class="prose">"Silence, or I will wring your worthless neck for
you," thundered Wilson; then, turning to the justice,
he added, "Ben Wilson is bad enough, God knows;
but he has never been guilty of circulating false reports
of a woman, out of revenge, because she resisted him,
as that miserable puppy has done in this case."</p>

<p class="prose">"You must be careful how you conduct yourself, Mr.
Wilson, or we shall have to commit you for contempt
of court," said the justice.</p>

<p class="prose">"Will you permit me to be sworn?" was that gentleman's
prompt reply.</p>

<p class="prose">"Certainly."</p>

<p class="prose">The oath was taken. "Now, sir, I shall recollect
that I am under oath, and must speak nothing but the
truth."</p>

<p class="prose">"Nothing but the truth," responded the justice.</p>

<p class="prose">"Well, then, gentlemen, some four months ago I became
acquainted with these ladies. Through the insinuations
thrown out by Stanford, and from remarks that
were made by a couple of women whose business it was
to go through the city and find out what they could of
other people's business,&mdash;pardon me, sir, I did not
intend to say that,&mdash;whose business it was to go
through the city and find out the religious condition

<!-- page 260 -->

thereof, and to distribute tracts to both saint and sinner;
through these two sources I inferred these ladies to be
of a very different character from what I found them
to be. I made an excuse to call on them; motives
none of the best, it is true; but, your honor, I found
such an atmosphere of purity there that I could just as
soon have approached an angel right out of heaven with
anything like disrespectful familiarity. They never encouraged
my visits; still, I have called occasionally,
for I felt a better man in their presence: and particularly
was I attracted to that sweet child who lies there
so still and pale, so much like the angel that she is, that
one forgets even the thoughts of sin in her presence."</p>

<p class="prose">The sound of his voice had aroused Eloise, and when
he said this, she fixed her eyes upon him with a bright
smile, and said, "I shall be with the angels soon."</p>

<p class="prose">Tears rushed to the strong man's eyes, as she said
this, and bowing hastily, with "I am done, sir," he left
the stand.</p>

<p class="prose">Two other parties now appeared upon the scene in the
persons of Mrs. Reid and Mr. Whitney. After pressing
the hand of Helen and her mother, and kissing the
lips of Eloise and little Mary, Mrs. Reid requested
permission to say a few words. She then gave a short
history of her acquaintance with the family, and of the
circumstances which had prejudiced people against them;
stating further what she had done to remove these suspicions
and the result. When she spoke of going to
the warehouse books to confirm that part of Mrs. Taylor's
story, the stony look of despair which had settled
upon the poor woman's face began to give way, and
when Mrs. Reid referred to the letters she had received

<!-- page 261 -->

from Rochester, and at the same time producing them,
both mother and daughter wept such tears as are a
relief to the overcharged heart.</p>

<p class="prose">Wilson listened with a countenance expressive of so
much joy that one expected momentarily to hear him
burst out with "Hail Columbia," or "Hallelujah;" but
Stanford slunk away like a whipped cur.</p>

<p class="prose">A carriage was provided, and the wronged family
were taken back to their home; but it was evident that
its most loved member would soon be beyond the reach
of earthly troubles. Indeed, she seemed beyond them
already, so calm and happy was her frame of mind.
Her perfect trust in the Infinite was beautiful to behold.</p>

<p class="prose">"God and the angels will make it all right," was her
only reply to all that had occurred. "They were with
me last night, mother, the beautiful angels, and they
made the prison a palace."</p>

<p class="prose">Towards evening she asked to see the minister, and
he quickly responded, his mother coming with him.
Mrs. Schoolcraft had thought much since her conversation
with Mrs. Reid on the previous evening, and as
much as she desired to justify herself in the part she
had acted towards Mrs. Taylor, when she compared her
course with that taken by Mrs. Reid, she could not fail
to see the difference. But what she felt most keenly
was the fact that she was the minister's mother, and, as
such, should have been first in defending the innocent,
instead of being found among the maligners. What
would people say when they learned the facts in the
case? She found herself in an awkward position, and
was glad to lay hold of anything that would help her

out of it, so when Eloise sent for her son, she offered
to go with him.</p>

<p class="prose">When Mrs. Taylor saw her coming, a spasm of agony
passed over her face. "O, I cannot have that woman
here," she murmured.</p>

<p class="prose">"Yes, mother, let her come," said Eloise.</p>

<p class="prose">The child did not ask who; she seemed to know
instinctively. Mrs. Taylor had not intended the words
for her ear; but it was impossible to keep anything
from her; her quickened senses took in all.</p>

<p class="prose">"Yes, mother, let her come, I want her," and so the
mother schooled herself to bear for the sake of her
child.</p>

<p class="prose">Eloise extended a hand to both, greeting them with
a smile. "I am most home," said she. "I wanted to
see you both before I went, and I am glad you have
come. Mother and sister tried to keep everything from
me that they thought would make me unhappy; but I
have known more of things than they supposed. It
would have troubled me to have my good mother and
sister misunderstood so cruelly; but something kept
saying to me, 'God and the angels will make it all
right.' "</p>

<p class="prose">"Taught of God," murmured the minister reverently,
while Eloise continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="prose">"You have wronged my mother, Mrs. Schoolcraft,
and my sister, too; but you were always kind to me.
I feel that you did not intend to wrong them, so I am
sure they will forgive you."</p>

<p class="prose">The proud woman was completely broken down, and,
as the tears streamed from her eyes, she extended her
hand to the stricken mother. Mrs. Taylor shrank from

<!-- page 263 -->

taking it, but the eyes of her child were upon her, and
she could not refuse.</p>

<p class="prose">A satisfied smile played over the features of the dying.
The whole company were in tears.</p>

<p class="prose">"O, Miss Eloise," sobbed Wilson, "when you get to
heaven, tell my sister Mary that her brother Ben will try
to meet her in peace."</p>

<p class="prose">Eloise cast her blue orbs, radiant with the light of
that heaven he was speaking of, full upon him. "O,
yes, you must come; we could not do without you."
Then, turning to her minister, she said: "I wanted to
thank you for all the beautiful things you have taught
me, but the angels are coming and I must go. Mother,
sisters, friends, they have come for me. I shall wait
for you all. Good by." And without a struggle the
beautiful eyes were closed forever.</p>

<p class="prose">The funeral was held in the little church where Eloise
was in the habit of attending. Mrs. Taylor at first
objected; but Mr. Schoolcraft said, "We ask it as a
favor, madam. You and yours have been cruelly
wronged, and do not deny us the privilege of making
all the reparation in our power, by thus publicly testifying
our respect," and so she consented that it should
be as they desired.</p>

<p class="prose">The tide that had so long set against this unfortunate
family had now turned, and it rose as high in the opposite
direction. The church was filled to the overflowing,
and again the minister spoke from the words, "And
now abideth faith, hope, and charity, but the greatest
of these three is charity;" and this time the seed fell not
among thorns, for the fallow ground had been completely
broken up. There was not a dry eye in the

<!-- page 264 -->

house, and Mr. Schoolcraft, in parting with Mrs.
Taylor, said,&mdash;</p>

<p class="prose">"Madam, what you have suffered here&mdash;the wrongs
that have been called upon to bear&mdash; has made a
deeper impression upon the minds of this people, will
be productive of more lasting good, than all of my
preaching for a year past."</p>

<p class="prose">The body of Eloise was not laid in the Cleveland
cemetery, but in an air-tight coffin, and packed in ice,
and on the following morning, instead of starting for
Cincinnati, as she had hoped, the bereaved mother went
with the beloved dead and her remaining loved ones on
board a steamer on her way back to Rochester, where
the dear remains were deposited beside those already
resting there: and now we will bid them farewell.</p>
