<h2>DR. JOHN MARIBEL.</h2>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="small">"HAST THOU NOT DROPPED FROM HEAVEN?"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> snow had been falling since three o'clock; 
and as night came on, a keen north wind set in, 
driving the frozen flakes into the faces of the 
passengers who rode outside on the coach, which made 
tri-weekly trips from S&mdash;&mdash;, causing them to pull up the 
collars of their overcoats, and put an extra fold of comforter 
about their chins.</p>

<p>It was quite dark when the coach reached the rambling
village, where the relay of fresh horses awaited them.
Lights gleaming from the narrow windows of the inn were 
indeed a welcome sight to those who had been riding for 
hours in face of a biting wind, and it needed not the 
landlord's cheery invitation to induce them to warm and 
refresh themselves before proceeding on their dreary night 
journey.</p>

<p>It would have been difficult to find a more pleasant 

<!-- page 12 -->

place than the bar of the Red Tavern&mdash;thus was it popularly 
called, from the fact that Jerry Triggs, its proprietor, 
had, with questionable taste, painted it of a dull red 
color.</p>

<p>However uninviting the exterior, ample accommodation, 
cleanliness, and the realization of the pleas of good 
cheer, which Jerry Triggs gave with beaming face and 
hearty earnestness, had made it a noted stopping place. 
For years he had driven a thriving business, and had now 
reached that period of substantial independence which 
secured for him the reputation of a solid man. This 
reputation went far towards the acquisition of popular 
favor, which expressed itself in a strong and increasing 
desire on the part of a goodly number of constituents to 
have him represent them in the next Congress. Triggs, 
however, understood somewhat the apocryphal character 
of popularity, and was wisely content to sit down under the 
tree of Liberty, and leave to others the perilous chance 
of climbing to its topmost branches. By this sound 
philosophy he escaped the hallucinations of ambition, and 
retained his property and good name.</p> 

<p>Thus we see that Jerry Triggs was a man of some 
importance; and the reader will therefore excuse the 
slight delay caused by his introduction, while we lingered 
on the threshold of the warm, bright apartment where 
Mrs. Triggs, a handsome young woman, was dispensing 
cups of hot coffee to the impatient travellers.</p>

<!-- page 13 -->

<p>During the bustle consequent upon serving so many
cold and hungry people, Mr. Triggs had not noticed 
an addition to his guests; nor was it until he heard Mrs. 
Triggs exclaiming, "Bless me! is that you, Dr. John?" 
that he turned to greet a young man carrying in his arms 
a child, so enveloped in wrappings, that the end only of a 
little nose and a pair of luminous brown eyes could be seen. </p>

<p>He placed it on a chair close to the fire, and without 
appearing to observe the looks of curiosity and astonishment 
which he attracted, he proceeded to divest her&mdash;for 
the child was a girl&mdash;of her surplus clothing.</p>

<p>"Deary me! and it's a real beauty," cried Mrs. Triggs. 
"Where ever did you pick her up, Dr. John?"</p>

<p>He looked up smiling at her pretty face, but did not
answer. He went on chafing the child's cold feet, covered 
with their thin cotton stockings, from which the toes were 
peeping. The little creature tossed back the golden curls, 
that, loosened from confinement, fell down her shoulders 
in a shining mass. What is prettier than this baby hair, 
like fine-spun gold, making an <i>aureole</i> around a cherub 
face?</p>

<p>She held out her dimpled hands towards the leaping 
blaze and said, with winning sweetness: </p>

<p>"Oo's dood, John; pease dive Kitty some bread and
butter."</p>

<p>"That I will, little one," he answered, "and Mrs.
Triggs will let us have some jam."</p>

<!-- page 14 -->

<p>A lull had taken place in the clamorous uproar caused 
by the clinking of glasses and the clash of many voices, 
while all eyes were bent on the tiny bit of humanity 
seated in the great wooden chair, and the broad-shouldered 
young man ministering so tenderly to her. Having made 
her quite comfortable, he rose and said; "Good evening, 
gentlemen," in full, rich tones, and with a manner so 
unmistakably sincere and cordial, that there was but one 
opinion in all that company, and it was, that John 
Maribel was an excellent fellow; an "out and outer," 
Tim Perkins said, as he sipped his whiskey and water, 
Tim Perkins was the coachman, and also a personage of 
importance in the days of which we write.</p>

<p>In our intercourse with our fellow-men, there is no 
instrument of power more efficient than that of a really 
kind and genial nature. That it is too often displayed 
with grudging parsimony is a misfortune which experience 
leads us deeply to deplore. On this occasion it 
opened the way to an acquaintance between two men 
occupying different spheres in life: the one, a gentleman, 
in the fullest sense of the arbitrary meaning of the word; 
the other a journeyman carpenter, who stood watching 
the scene which was passing before him, the distinctive 
marks of his face sharpened into intense curiosity.</p>

<p>When little Kitty was in a fair way of enjoying her 
bread and jam, and her checks were being lavishly 
smeared with the sugared mixture, John Maribel felt himself 

<!-- page 15 -->

at liberty to assuage the pangs of curiosity which kept 
Mrs. Triggs hovering about the child.</p>

<p>"What do you think of this real flesh and blood doll 
baby, Mrs. Triggs?" he said; "most people got their gifts 
on Christmas morning, but you see that mine has come 
on Christmas eve."</p>

<p>"Dear me, sir," she answered, "how you always <i>do</i>
go on; as if you want me to believe that she really and 
truly belongs to you!"</p>

<p>"I assure you that I have no reason to doubt my claim 
to her." </p>

<p>"Dr. John! I wonder at you. Who would have believed 
it of <i>you?</i>"</p>

<p>"What?" he asked, laughing.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing at all," she answered, blushing and looking 
very pretty, "only folks have always held the best 
opinion of you, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear madam, pray believe that I have done nothing
in this instance to forfeit the good opinion of any one. 
When I will have told you, on my honor, that my claim 
to the child is based entirely upon the authority of this 
scrap of paper, I feel convinced that I will retain your 
favor, which, I declare, I should be sorry to lose."</p>

He drew from his pocket a folded slip of letter paper. 
"I found her sitting beside old Ethan Featherstone, this 
afternoon&mdash;or I should rather say evening, for it was late
when I reached the house. The old man was dead, and 

<!-- page 16 -->

the child was lying curled up in his great leathern chair, 
crying from cold and hunger. This curious bit of a letter 
was pinned to her frock. Evidently a woman's hand had 
arranged the shawl about her form, and placed the letter 
where it might be readily discovered."</p>

<p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Triggs approached eagerly to hear
its contents, which wore as follows:</p>

<br/>

<p>"I know that you are coming, John Maribel. You have 
done your best to save my worthless life&mdash;save this child 
from the fate which must otherwise await her. I have 
perhaps studied overmuch the vices of men with systematic 
hatred, which has obscured my mental vision and rendered 
me, in a manner, impervious to the warm sympathies 
which emanate from a genial nature; but if I have hated 
vice, and, what is worse, the travesty of virtue, my embittered 
heart has yet the power of appreciating genuine 
honesty and uprightness, and of knowing a good man 
when I meet him. I die, believing that, in you, my confidence 
is not misplaced.</p>

<p class="right">"ETHAN FEATHERSTONE.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;Call the child Kitty."</p>

<br/>

<p>"That is all," said John Maribel; refolding the scrap of 
paper. "I have brought Kitty here through the storm 
and darkness, and if she has anything to regret, she has 
certainly forgotten it in her enjoyment of bread and jam."</p>

<!-- page 17 -->

<p>"God bless my soul!" exclaimed Mr. Triggs, "so old 
Featherstone is dead at last! A poor, pitiful, old skinflint! 
For the sake, however, of the handsome words 
he's left about you, I'm almost inclined to forgive the long 
score I've run up against him. I'll back them with my 
indorsement, and, by George! I know that every man in 
the country will do the same."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my good friend," answered John Maribel 
in a somewhat embarrassed tone, for the words of Mr.
Triggs had drawn upon him the gaze of the travellers. 
"I fear," he added, "that my concern for the little girl 
has made me forgetful of poor old Featherstone, whose 
remains lie uncared for in the lonely house. Pray, see 
that some one be sent at once; and it would be well, also, 
to inform Mr. Sharpe, as there may be a will."</p>

<p>"It's my opinion," said Triggs, "based upon my knowledge 
of the man, that he was too mean ever to bring himself 
to parting with his money. He'd have made a compact 
with the devil himself, to keep anybody else from 
enjoying it. It may, in all probability, be found in a strong 
box under his bed."</p>

<p>"Trust me, Mr. Triggs, Mr. Featherstone has left no 
such convenient prey to the pilferer. Although he lived 
in open hostility to all the amenities of life; and though 
little solicitous about the good opinion of his fellow-men, 
he was a deep-thinking man, of sound judgment in matters 
of business, and I warrant you he has committed no absurdity 

<!-- page 18 -->

in the disposition of wealth, which I believe to be 
considerable."</p>

<p>"Time's up, gentlemen!" shouted the stentorian lungs 
of Tim Perkins. There was a scramble for hats and overcoats; 
and little Kitty was hastily enveloped in her 
wrappings and heartily kissed by good Mrs. Triggs, who 
surreptitiously conveyed to her, over John Maribel's 
shoulder, a paper of sweet cakes, for which she was rewarded 
by a delighted smile, and "Oo's dood too," from
the rosebud mouth, half buried in the filmy scarf of 
knitted wool, which the kind woman had brought out 
from the treasures in her bureau drawer, to keep the little 
one warm during the journey.</p>

<p>The coach was unusually full, the inside places all taken, 
and when John Maribel stood by with his burthen, Tim 
Perkins shouted from his elevated seat: "There's no 
room inside, Doctor. You'll have to get up here."</p>

<p>"No, he shall not," exclaimed a voice from the interior 
of the coach; and, at the same time, a young man in a 
rough overcoat sprang out and earnestly insisted that Dr. 
Maribel should take his place.</p>

<p>"You can't think of exposing the child, sir, on such a 
night as this."</p>

<p>"I am really very much obliged to you," exclaimed 
John, in a voice which testified in its earnest, hearty tones 
to his sense of the stranger's kindness. "Your name, if 
you please?"</p>

<!-- page 19 -->

<p>"Perry Deane."</p>

<p>"All right!" and Tim Perkins cracked his whip clear 
and sharp; the horses snorted impatiently; the passengers 
settled themselves as comfortably as they might; then a 
plunge into the darkness, and the coach rambled on towards 
its destination.</p>

<div class="center" id="ch02">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">"THERE IS A WRITTEN SCROLL."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Eighteen</span> months before the opening of this 
story, a man in worn, shabby clothes, wearing 
an aspect of settled discontent upon his shrivelled 
face, with a manner directly opposed to that which 
Cicero terms <i>urbanitas</i>, stopped at the Red Tavern, and 
after spending two days in looking about, bargaining for 
house, he at last fixed upon a lonely and dilapidated tenement, 
three miles away from the village, which from its 
bare and barren situation was called Stony-hill Farm. As 
to the farm, it required a good deal of credulity to believe 
that it ever had existed; for the land was worn into gullies, 
and was productive of nothing better than a crop of 
broom-sedge and a few stunted wild-plum trees.</p>

<!-- page 20 -->

<p>Ethan Featherstone's morose silence seemed to indicate
that he fully appreciated the hazardous faculty of speech. 
He invited no man's good-will, and repulsed the advances 
which, as a stranger coming to settle among them, the 
simple country folks were tempted to make.</p>

<p>He at once impressed them with the importance which 
attaches to every man who can pay promptly for what he 
wants. These wants, miserably meagre, were, however, 
so easily satisfied, that few were the better for his means 
of gratifying them. Upon taking possession of his house, 
he quickly placed the barrier of his uncourteous manners, 
and his biting cynicism, between himself and the outer 
world; and his unusual mode of life gave rise to a rumor, 
which soon settled down into an accepted fact, that Ethan
Featherstone was that epitome of human meanness&mdash;a 
miser.</p>

<p>Shut out from all social sympathy, the old man dragged 
on the weary burthen of days&mdash;heavy with the weight of 
monotonous misery&mdash;until at last his growing infirmities 
of body caused him to desire medical care, and the young 
negro, the only person admitted to his presence, was dispatched 
to the village with a letter for Dr. Maribel. 
The return coach brought "Dr. John," as the people soon 
learned to call the genial, kind-hearted young physician, 
whose visits ever afterwards were the signal for a perfect 
mob of anxious mothers, who came to consult him about 
their teething babies, and the rheumatics of their aged 

<!-- page 21 -->

relations. For nearly a year Dr. Maribel had stopped 
regularly at the Red Tavern, once, sometimes twice a 
month, and walked from there to Stony-hill, to visit Mr. 
Featherstone. Through that time he had really learned 
very little about the old man, who kept up, during his 
brief visits, a determined silence, which he seldom broke, 
except to ask the unvarying question:</p>

<p>"How long will I last, John Maribel?"</p>

<p>The term of his existence was at last drawing to its 
close; shadows, darkening into deepest gloom, gathered 
about his solitary death-bed. Unloved, unwept, surrounded 
by the squalor of poverty, which was the more 
horrible because it was not forced upon him by the inevitable 
grip of want, he lay, waiting for the summons which 
he seemed to regard with stoical indifference.</p>

<p>The wind sighed and moaned around the old house, now 
loosening a shingle from the roof, and then swooping 
down the chimney, sending a cloud of soot and ashes into 
the room where the sick man lay. The snow had whitened 
the crest of the hill and covered the path which led to the 
house. A woman, carrying a child, came painfully breasting 
the storm, toiling slowly upwards, half blinded by the 
driving snow, and shivering as she drew the shawl about 
the child, leaving her own frail form to the sting of the 
merciless cold.</p>

<p>On reaching the house, and seeing the hall door ajar, 
she pushed it open, and holding the child by the hand, 

<!-- page 22 -->

moved noiselessly down the hall to the chamber where 
Ethan Featherstone awaited her. Entering, she seated 
the child before the smouldering fire, and then turned to 
meet the burning eyes of the old man. The ghost of a 
disagreeable smile made his face yet more ghastly as he 
said:</p>

<p>"So you have answered my summons."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have brought Kitty."</p>

<p>"Let me look at her," he said, with a look in his eyes 
which might have been a shadow from the far past, for it 
changed his face.</p>

<p>The soul so long imprisoned in its hard case of cynical 
misanthropy was struggling to assert its divine essence. 
Innocence, the touchstone of human sympathy, struck 
upon the chord which vibrates in soft cadences, reaching 
far down into the heart, and awakening tender memories.</p>

<p>The child was lifted to the side of his bed, and under 
the influence of softening emotion, he said: "I would 
bless you, little Kitty, but my blessing might turn into a 
curse." He placed his bony hand upon the golden head, 
and then drew it back somewhat impatiently, saying: 
"Take her away; it is too late now to wish that I had 
taught her to love me."</p>

<p>Kitty was again settled near the fire, and the woman 
went back to the side of the dying man. He was breathing 
painfully. She made a movement to raise him, which 
he scornfully repulsed.</p>

<!-- page 23 -->

<p>"Stand there, and listen," he said, speaking slowly and 
catching his breath, while the old, hard look came back 
into his face. "It is coming fast enough, Frances Featherstone; 
my time is growing fearfully short. The summing 
up of your offences against me and mine might 
arouse the slumbering passion which has consumed away 
my life, and might now hasten its departure. I will have 
discharged my debt to you when you know my firm and 
unalterable will with regard to the child. The actions of 
Providence are mysterious beyond our ken, and mercy is 
ono of its most visible ministrants. In examining, as I 
have done, the motives which influence my actions, I have 
no hesitation in attributing them to what I consider a 
sense of justice. Hate, perhaps, has tyrannized over my 
judgment&mdash;so be it. I leave to Providence the exercise
of mercy. My mind has too long habituated itself to the 
contemplation of my wrongs to swerve now from the execution 
of an inexorable decision. I know that a man 
hazards much when he attempts to compass the infinite by 
the finite; but I have dared to attempt the direction of a 
human life&mdash;to assume the responsibility of the governing 
influences which are to turn it to good or to evil."</p>

<p>He paused; his voice had sunk so low that Frances 
Featherstone could scarcely hear his words. After a silence 
of several minutes he bade her bring the Bible from 
the table. She moved at his command, as though under 
some fell influence, mechanically placing her hand upon 

<!-- page 24 -->

the holy volume, and saying in a hollow voice&mdash;for she 
divined his purpose&mdash;"I am ready."</p>

<p>"Repeat after me: 'I swear, as I hope for God's mercy, 
that I will abide by the conditions of Ethan Featherstone's 
will. I swear, from this night, to renounce all claim to 
Catherine, the lawful heir of Oscar Featherstone.' "</p>

<p>A low cry burst from her lips. "Oh!" she moaned, 
"is this your revenge?"</p>

<p>"Refuse," the old man said, "and the child goes from
here a beggar like yourself."</p>

<p>The colorless face seemed to grow more livid in its 
sharp agony as she murmured: "I consent."</p>

<p>"Now read this," he said, drawing a folded document
from beneath his pillow. "It is a copy of my will. It 
is well that you should acquaint yourself with its contents.
Read, so that I may not lose a word." </p>

<p>In low, quavering tones she commenced. </p>

<p>"Louder," he whispered hoarsely. "Your voice was
not wont to tremble thus." </p>

<p>She gave him one flashing glance, while the flush of 
anger mounted to her cheek; but some powerful motive 
moved her to obedience, and she recommenced, this time
in a clear, distinct voice:</p>

<p>"This is my last will and testament. I name, appoint, 
and constitute James McStebbins the executor of my 
estate. After the payment of all my just debts, I direct 
my executor to take charge and possession of all my 

<!-- page 25 -->

property, real and personal, and to hold the same in trust 
for the benefit of Catherine Featherstone, now aged three
years. When said Catherine shall have reached the age 
of twenty-one years, I hereby direct James McStebbins, 
my executor, to deliver over to the said Catherine Featherstone 
the property of which I die possessed, together with 
all the increase which shall have accumulated from the 
period of my death to the period of the transfer, thereby 
constituting her my sole and universal heir, under and 
upon the following conditions:</p>

<p>"The conditions upon which I above bequeath all of 
my estate to Catherine Featherstone are, that she shall 
immediately, upon my death, be removed from the custody 
of her mother, and that no intercourse or correspondence 
shall exist between the said Catherine Featherstone 
and her mother, at any time or under any circumstances, 
until she shall have attained her twenty-first year. </p>

<p>"During the minority of the said Catherine Featherstone, 
I direct my executor to provide for her subsistence 
at the rate of $30 (thirty dollars) monthly, to 
be delivered to such protectors as she may have, without 
disclosing her origin, or the source whence come these 
provisions.</p>

<p>"Should, however, these conditions not have been observed, 
and Catherine have held communication and intercourse 
with her mother, and have been under her protection, 
guidance, and advice, then I revoke all bequests and 

<!-- page 26 -->

dispositions in her behalf, and I designate and make my 
nephew, Gaston de Ferri&egrave;re, the son of my sister, Agnes 
Featherstone, by her lawful husband, Charles Alphonse 
de Ferri&egrave;re, my sole and universal heir; and I direct my 
executor to turn over and convey to him all my estate, 
charging him, however, with an annuity in favor of 
Catherine Featherstone of $500 (five hundred dollars) during 
the term of her natural life." </p>

<p>"Stop," said the old man, "the rest does not concern
you. Bring the ink and paper from yonder table. Write, 
as I dictate."</p>

<p>She wrote, without remonstrance, the note which John
Maribel found pinned to Kitty's dress.</p>

<p>Kitty had fallen asleep by the fire, her rosy lips apart, 
the flush of sleep on her checks. Her head had dropped 
sideways, and the little rosy hands lay on her lap. Oh! 
what a picture to contemplate! Frances Featherstone 
stood looking at her, and the old man from the bed lay 
looking at the two. Once, the woman turned an entreating 
glance towards him, but she withdrew it with a despairing 
sigh.</p>

<p>"Why do you linger?" he said; "you must not be 
found here."</p>

<p>She raised the sleeping child in her arms, pressing her 
with a passionate movement to her bosom, and then 
placed her in a chair beside the bed. Kitty gave a contented 
sigh as her head sunk upon the arm of the chair.

<!-- page 27 -->

Exhausted by the long journey, the child slept, all unconscious 
of her mother's martyrdom.</p>

<p>Frances knelt for a moment beside the child, her whole 
soul seeming to go forth to her as she covered her with 
that look of ineffable tenderness which wells from a 
mother's heart. Then rising, with a wild agony in her 
face, and without hazarding another look, she left the room.
This woman, in the supreme moment of decision, had 
reached a point of heroism which exalted her to a standard 
of virtue strongly in contradiction to her past, and perhaps 
ineffectual in its influence upon her future; yet, for 
the moment, the one pure sentiment of her heart&mdash;her 
love for her child&mdash;was the incentive which moved her to 
a sacrifice that embodied a total renunciation of those ties, 
the severance of which cost so terrible a pang to a mother's 
heart.</p>

<p>There are many crownless martyrs&mdash;unrecorded saints&mdash;heroic 
acts of self-abnegation that in many instances are
only known by the higher Power which inspires them.
They are none the less grand&mdash;none the less worthy of 
immortality.</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="small">"I WILL BE WELCOME THEN?"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the ride of twenty miles John Maribel
had ample time to cast about in his mind for
some plan by which his new charge might receive
the care which her tender age required. As he folded the
little soft thing in his strong arms, a great tenderness 
went out towards her. She seemed so greatly to be pitied 
in her infantine forlornness! Each time that the sweet 
lips were held up for a kiss, another link was forged in 
the chain of his bondage. A great heart is so quick to 
yield to helplessness!</p>

<p>Children experience readily the <i>rapport</i> which exists
between their confiding trust and the sympathy which wins 
it. Kitty's often-repeated "Oo's dood, John," was but the 
manifestation of her satisfaction in her new friend, greatly 
enhanced by her enjoyment of Mrs. Triggs's sweet cake. 
In all probability, the sweet cakes caused the predominant 
feeling. Is it not a little shocking to the finer sensibilities 
when we see that the principle of Faith in human love is
mainly created by the power which actuates that love to 
gratify the senses? </p>

<!-- page 29 -->

<p>The increasing inclemency of the weather, and the lateness 
of the hour when the coach reached the town, induced 
John Maribel to put into immediate execution a plan 
which, at that trying moment, offered itself as the only 
solution of a difficulty, which was every instant growing 
more serious. Calling a cab, he directed the driver to 
take him to Samuel Pitkin's, 180 Broad street.</p>

<p>An exclamation of delight burst from Kitty when she 
found herself before a brilliantly-lighted window, where
Christmas good things were piled in bewildering abundance, 
and surmounted by a figure of Santa Claus with a 
sprig of holly in his hand. In the midst of the tempting 
display, a highly-illuminated card informed the public 
that Samuel Pitkin wished them a happy Christmas, and 
invited them to go within, where they would find the 
means of spending it merrily, at the least possible expense. 
John Maribel smiled as his eye fell upon honest Pitkin's 
card. It was a simple device to allure the passer-by; but 
John Maribel know that Samuel Pitkin would amply fulfil 
the promise held out, both as to quality and weight. 
When Kitty had looked until her little heart was ready 
to burst with covetousness, John took her in his arms, and 
opening the glass door entered the shop. Mr. Pitkin was 
in the act of weighing out a pound of candied citron when 
he espied Dr. Maribel. Wiping his hands, he came from 
behind the counter with an expression of questioning 
curiosity upon his face.</p>

<!-- page 30 -->

<p>"Eh! Doctor," he cried; "what's this you've brought 
us? It's Christmas times, and most people are looking for 
surprises; but, upon my word, I didn't expect to see you 
coming here with a&mdash;&mdash;. I declare, if it isn't a little girl!" </p>

<p>Now John Maribel was in his heart sincerely relieved to
find that Mr. Pitkin was inclined to take his coming with 
the child so good-naturedly, and, indulging his humor, he 
said:</p>

<p>"May I take her in by the fire, Mr. Pitkin? She is
tired from her long journey."</p>

<p>They passed into the little parlor, all aglow with light 
from the roaring fire, and brilliant with Christmas holly. 
A comfortable, motherly-looking little woman, in the 
whitest of caps, sat knitting on one side of the fireplace. 
She rose at sight of John Maribel, and so great was her 
astonishment as her eyes fell upon the pretty little creature 
whom he carried in his arms, that her knitting dropped 
from her hands, the ball of yarn rolling into the fire.</p>

<p>"Why, Dr. John, who's this you've brought to us? 
Oh! my heart! the pretty, pretty angel!" she exclaimed, 
as Dr. Maribel released Kitty's curls from the 
muffling comforter. "Oh, the deary dear!" And she 
took the child to her motherly bosom, and covered her 
with kisses.</p>

<p>"Oo's dood too," lisped Kitty, setting the kind woman 
off again into paroxysms of admiration.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitkin looked on with a puzzled face. He understood 

<!-- page 31 -->

nothing about it, and was each moment becoming 
more bewildered, John Maribel thought it time to explain; 
so he told the good couple all that he knew about 
the child. He had thought of Mrs. Pitkin as the person 
most likely to assume the charge of the child, without 
stinting her of love, the thing which children most thrive 
upon. Kitty might, in time, make up to them for all that 
they had lost, and&mdash;John suddenly paused in painful confusion&mdash;utterly 
amazed at the result of his words, for 
Mrs. Pitkin had rushed into the arms of her husband, and 
was saying, between sobbing and weeping:</p>

<p>"It's pretty Martha come back to us, Samuel! I know
you're a little near; but it's no use saving when you've 
none of your own to leave it to."</p>

<p>"It's Christmas eve, Susan," answered Mr. Pitkin, 
" 'Peace on earth, and good will to men.' For little
Martha's sake," and a tear trembled in his eye, "we will 
keep the child."</p>

"Pray allow me to explain," said John Maribel, who 
had again taken the child in his arms, for her little face 
was white and quivering. "I fear that I have managed 
but awkwardly, if you understand that in bringing this 
child to you I yield all responsibility for her. On the 
contrary, I claim my share in her maintenance. You,
dear Mrs. Pitkin, can do much more for her&mdash;you can
give her a mother's love and care."</p>

<p>Mr. Pitkin, it must be confessed, was strongly biased by 

<!-- page 32 -->

what Mrs. Pitkin termed "nearness;" and we all know 
how quickly conscience, which usually prompts us to do 
right, accommodates itself to the impulse which urges us
to do wrong. He had but a moment before pronounced 
the words of the angelic chorus, which, on that memorable 
night of a Saviour's advent, burst upon the Judean shepherds 
in glorious harmony, "Peace on earth, and good will 
to men." Samuel Pitkin's good will never overstepped 
the barrier of his ruling motive; and being really sincere
in his desire to do right, but obstinately averse from 
parting with his money, he accommodated his charity to 
suit the suggestions of a conscience which had suffered hard
usage, but still attempted to perform its duty in the way
of admonitions, which were sometimes grudgingly obeyed. 
On this occasion he must have experienced a sharper reminder 
than usual; for though at heart glad to know 
that Dr. Maribel would do his part&mdash;and he knew that 
would be a generous one&mdash;he said: "She is a little 
thing yet; and mother and I won't grumble about the 
bit she will eat. I might be better off; but I don't complain."</p>

<p>"Oh, Samuel!" cried Mrs. Pitkin, "to hear you talk, 
one might think that you had squandered your savings, 
when you've got a pretty sum laid by."</p>

<p>"That's neither here nor there, mother. Give the child 
her tea, and I'll bring down the little bed."</p>

<p>John Maribel, being anxious to get home, saw with 

<!-- page 33 -->

satisfaction that Kitty's welcome was assured. Promising 
to return on the morrow, he kissed the child, who 
strongly protested against his departure, and would be consoled 
only when Mr. Pitkin took her into the shop, and 
from the depths of a glass jar drew out a stick of bright 
candy.</p>

<p>On opening the door leading into the street, John 
Maribel met face to face his travelling companion, Perry 
Deane, the young man who had given up his place in the 
coach to him.</p>

<p>"This is indeed a piece of good fortune!" he exclaimed, 
stepping back into the shop. "Allow me to thank you 
again, Mr. Deane, for your generous conduct to little Kitty, 
and to ask you to do me the favor to call at my office at 
your earliest convenience."</p>

<p>"I am much obliged to you, sir; but, really, I am 
but an humble journeyman carpenter;" and Perry said 
it as though he was proud of not being ashamed to own 
it.</p>

<p>A pair of honest eyes are a wondrous advantage to a 
man; and when John Maribel held out his hand and said: 
"I am heartily glad to know you," looking straight at 
Perry Deane, the young carpenter gave back the friendly 
look, yielding at once to the potent influence.</p>

<p>The disparities of birth and position were swept away 
by a manner which seemed to take sweetness from the 
amenities of the heart. The delicate tact of well-bred 

<!-- page 34 -->

man had overcome the proud shyness of the young 
carpenter; and Perry gave the required promise, as John 
Maribel, again shaking hands, went out into the street.</p>

<div class="center" id="ch04">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="small">"OH, WHAT A SYMPATHY OF WOE IS THIS!"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Perry entered the parlor, he found it empty; 
the bedroom door being ajar, he ventured to 
look in. What was his surprise to see the old 
couple standing together, their heads bowed over an old-fashioned 
daguerreotype case, which Mrs. Pitkin held, 
shifting the position from time to time in order to get a 
better view of the treacherous image, while Mr. Pitkin 
was actually wiping his eyes with his red silk handkerchief.</p>

<p>"You remember that little frock, Samuel," said Mrs.
Pitkin; "how I worked evenings, a tucking and tucking, 
until my eyes was nearly out, so fine was they, and regular 
to a thread; and you bought the bit of ribbon to tie up 
the sleeves; and pa, he gave her the little red shoes, and 
proud was we when we all went off together, you carrying 
Martha, and had her picture taken. Do you see any likeness, 

<!-- page 35 -->

Samuel, between the two? No, I'm afraid there 
ain't, Martha's hair was dark, and her skin was not so 
fair; but children is children; their sweet ways is all the 
same, and may be, when God takes one away, he makes a 
place for another."</p>

<p>Perry's eyes had wandered from the old people to the 
child, who lay in the little bed which had been brought 
from the garret, where it had stood tenantless for so many 
years. She was curled up in her soft nest, her hair covering 
the pillow, and contrasting in its golden tint with the 
long eyelashes that shadowed her cheeks, flushed into a 
delicate rose hue, like the lining of a sea-shell. The parted 
lips showed the small, regular teeth; and one dimpled 
hand rested on the coverlet. Perry turned again to look 
at the two old faces, transformed by the magic of parental 
loves touching in their grief; softened into actual comeliness 
by the recollection of those few brief years when 
little Martha was their own; drawn into closer sympathy 
over the blurred picture, and trying to believe that their 
old hearts could take in another love&mdash;that the child so 
strangely committed to their care would fill the place of 
the lost one.</p>

<p>"Ah, Samuel! Mrs. Pitkin said, shutting the case of 
the daguerreotype, "this one was bone of our bone and 
flesh of our flesh."</p>

<p>Simple words, which exhaust all that we could say of 
that love, so nearly perfect&mdash;so nearly divine, which 

<!-- page 36 -->

lives in a mother's heart. Perry went softly back to the 
fire, and seated himself in his accustomed place. He felt 
guilty, as though he had violated the sanctuary of their 
inner lives. Hitherto, he had thought old Pitkin's soul 
no larger than one of his nutmegs, and his heart as 
incapable of any gentle emotion; and here he was crying 
over a baby's picture. Mother Pitkin had risen into 
the dignity of a sorrowing Rachel. Her round face 
was no longer meaningless to Perry, and when she 
came into the room, he took her hand, and said quite 
gently:</p>

<p>"Mother, I'm glad to be here to-night. May God send 
you many a happy Christmas eve, and happier Christmas 
mornings." The timbre of his voice struck strangely upon
his own ear, for his words were a nearer approach to 
sentiment than he was accustomed to make; and he 
shrank away in confusion from the tearful old face, now 
turned up towards his&mdash;near enough to have received the 
kiss which he was half-tempted to give. Instead, he put 
his hand into his pocket and drew out a soft package, 
which he opened.</p>

<p>"I heard you say that you would like to have some 
country-spun wool, such as you used to knit with in your 
young days. While I was up at Mapleton I got this for 
you."</p>

<p>"The very thing I was wishing for to-night! Samuel, 
he likes knitted socks; and bought yarn don't seem to last 

<!-- page 37 -->

like that you got spun by the country folks. It takes you, 
Perry, to humor an old woman."</p>

<p>In the meantime Mr. Pitkin had set out lemons and 
sugar and a decanter of whiskey. The old man was famous 
at mixing punch; to-night, of all nights, he mixed 
it with care, measuring out the ingredients, and stirring
until Perry thought that he would never have finished. 
And there was the cold chicken pie, its raised crust lying 
so temptingly near the knife which Mrs. Pitkin had laid 
on the top of it. At last they drew up around the table, 
Mrs. Pitkin first going in to take a look at Kitty. While 
Perry is eating his pie, Mrs. Pitkin looks on with smiling 
satisfaction. She was proud of her pastry, and secretly 
gloried in Perry's appetite, perverting the art of cookery 
to a flattery of his palate, which might have jeopardized 
his digestive apparatus, had it not been under the control 
of a perfect physical organization. As it was, Perry's 
appetite was a standing joke; and to look at him, tall and 
broad and strong, one could connect no idea of pain or 
sickness with the vigor of his young life. The monthly 
stipend which he paid for board and lodging was scarcely 
equivalent to what he received. The old couple had grown 
to like him cordially, and in a great measure to depend 
upon him for counsel, trusting to his common-sense view 
of things, which seldom led him into error. Perry's opinions 
were based upon a practical working out of their results. 
He seldom hit a nail on the head without driving 

<!-- page 38 -->

it solidly into the heart of the wood; and he had hammered 
out a good many ideas from the hard routine of a 
workman's life. From his own standpoint he looked upon 
his trade as being the very best in the world; and he considered
industry and honesty the best weapons with which
to fight off the disadvantages of poverty and want of education. 
His code of morals was simple enough. With 
him, right was right, and his proud, honest egoism had a 
hearty dislike to whatever interfered with his credit and 
respectability. Mrs. Pitkin was wont to say that Perry 
was a "likely young man." Translated into more elegant 
parlance, he was a handsome man. His well-defined features, 
not wanting in regularity, were set off by a luxuriant 
beard and a close-curling crop of black hair; and he 
had a direct way of looking at people whom he addressed, 
as if he was giving them the fullest opportunity of reading 
into the depths of his soul, while, all unconsciously, he was 
exerting a certain power, generally a conciliatory one, 
which, being characteristically calm, lent him a dignity 
that raised him at once to that importance which imperceptibly 
clings to a man whose individuality needs no 
props&mdash;no accidental influence, and stands out boldly 
asserting itself. As the son of Peleus had a vulnerable heel, 
owing to the carelessness of Thetis, so Nature 
has been scarcely less blamable; for while she endows 
her children with qualities calculated to protect them 
from danger, she frequently leaves some vulnerable weakness

<!-- page 39 -->

which often upsets the whole moral harmony of a 
character.</p>

<p>Unhappily for Perry Deane, he possessed this weakness 
in the shape of pride, which narrowed this mental vision;
and, as in optics, we see everything by means of the rays 
of light which proceed from it, so Perry was apt to allow
himself to be biased by influences emanating from this 
pride. He knew that it was only upon the assessment 
of his personal merit that he was to be valued; and his 
proud, sensitive nature was covetous of that approbation 
which depends so completely upon that merit. He had a 
bold, not to say presumptuous, reliance upon himself. 
From his earliest years this reliance had proved his best 
friend. During his friendless childhood he had learned 
to estimate the slim chances of the world's sympathetic 
aid, and he was little inclined now to lean upon any manifestation 
of it. So, as he rose from the table, he said to 
Mrs. Pitkin:</p>

<p>"I'm half sorry that I promised to go to Dr. Maribel. 
I can't see that we've got anything in common, or that he 
has any cause to fee! bound to continue our acquaintance."</p>

<p>"There it is again, Perry!" replied Mr. Pitkin. "You 
never know when a man means well by you. Take my 
word for it, John Maribel will be glad to see you."</p>

<p>"As if Perry wasn't as good as the best," put in Mrs.
Pitkin.</p>

<p>"Thank you, mother," answered Perry, smiling, "I 

<!-- page 40 -->

am sure, if your good opinion could help me, I would be 
as 'good as the best;' but, unfortunately, I am not, in 
one sense of the word. I am not a gentleman, as the 
world goes; and a carpenter has no business putting himself 
in the way of getting floored for being out of his 
place."</p>

<p>"Dear me! but you've a masterful spirit, Perry. Just 
you take my advice, and go and see Dr. Maribel quite 
natural like, I'll brush your best coat; and there's your 
new shirt, as stiff as starch can make it; and the red cravat 
that sets you off so nicely, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, mother," cried Perry. "You don't suppose 
that I'm going dressed up in my best clothes to see Dr.
Maribel? Can't you see that I'd be trying to ape the gentleman. 
No; I go as the carpenter, Perry Deane, or not 
at all."</p>

<p>"You're right there," said Mr. Pitkin, putting down
the candle which he had taken up preparatory to going to 
bed. "You're right, Perry; every man is entitled to be 
judged for himself, and I, for one, don't believe in making 
pretensions. Pretensions sit on a man like a badly-fitting 
coat. I only say that I don't know any one who can hold 
his own better than you; and you'll be standing in your 
own light if you don't accept what a man, as honest as 
yourself, offers you."</p>

<p>"Well," answered Perry, "I'll see about it in the 
morning. Good-night; I shall be off to the shop by daylight. 

<!-- page 41 -->

Mr. Graham is sure to be there waiting for me. 
You needn't put up anything for me, mother. I'll be 
back to breakfast."</p>

<p>Kitty slept on. The noise died away in the street. 
The clock went tick, tack, tick, tack, and the sleet pelted 
against the windows. Honest Pitkin was dreaming, perchance, 
of his Christmas customers, and heard not the 
stealthy step, the creaking sound of an opening door, close 
to his unconscious head. He slept on, unwaking by the 
closing again of the door, or the apparition of Mrs. Pitkin 
carrying in her arms a doll's cradle, which she placed 
close beside Kitty's bed.</p>

<p>"There," she murmured, "Santa Claus has come for 
you, little one. It was my Martha's&mdash;the doll and all."</p>

<p>Tenderly she smoothed the bit of faded silk that covered 
the doll, and a teardrop fell upon it. She did not heed 
it, but it was gathered by the recording angel and carried 
where the treasures of human love are garnered for 
eternity.</p>

<div class="center" id="ch05">

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="small">"TOO GENTLE AND TOO FREE A MAN."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">John Maribel's</span> office was a snug little room, 
on the ground floor of the house in which he 
lived. Back of the office was a waiting-room
for patients, and from ten to twelve P.M. it was generally 

<!-- page 42 -->

occupied by that class who draw largely upon a young 
physician's time and patience, and yield but little increase
to his income. Besides the house, he possessed nothing 
but his profession; and as yet this barely sufficed for his 
maintenance, and that of an invalid aunt, his sole surviving 
relative.</p>

<p>This old aunt was now sitting by the parlor fire upstairs, 
enveloped in a long black cloak, and raising her 
thin wizened face every now and then to look at the 
mantel-clock. It was on the stroke to nine before John 
Maribel made his appearance. The furniture of the room 
was old and threadbare; the hard-backed chairs stood 
grimly against the walls, and the old lady looked as if 
she had crept out of the past, of which everything in the 
room seemed to be a relic, except the young man who 
stood on the hearth-rug&mdash;his feet wide apart, and his back 
to the fire. This young man was pleasant to look at.
Though no Apollo, he did look as though Earth might 
have smiled at his birth. His face, in which no one feature 
was remarkable, except, perhaps, his blue eyes, was 
characterized by its look of open, genial honesty, and by 
the play of his flexible mouth, which formed itself so 
readily into a smile, brightening it into an attractiveness 
that won for him, wherever he was known, the popularity 
which attaches itself to a man who is universally conceded 
to be a "good fellow." Not a good-for-nothing "good 
fellow"&mdash;a pleasant, unprincipled care-for-naught; but a 

<!-- page 43 -->

thoroughly honest, large-hearted man, a little careless of 
his own interest, but delicately sensitive to those of his 
fellow-men.</p>

<p>He had a habit of passing his fingers through his blond 
air, which curled closely to his head; and he stood now 
looking at Aunt Parrott as though he were puzzled over 
the palpable paradox of wishing a <i>merry</i> Christmas to 
the vinegar-faced old lady.</p>

<p>"I am really sorry to have kept you waiting, aunt," 
he said; "but really I was quite used up last night. I
won't have to go up to Stony-hill again. The old man 
is dead, and I'm. glad&mdash;&mdash;"</p> 

<p>"What, John! glad! You do not mean to say that 
you are glad that the man is dead?"</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly, aunt, I only mean that going up 
there was a bore; and I would much rather find a paying 
patient at home."</p>

<p>"Paying patient! Indeed, you might well wish for 
one."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, wishing is a very idle business,"
laughed John. "In spite of the hard times, I have brought 
you a Christmas present." He drew from his pocket a 
morocco case containing a pair of gold spectacles, and 
laid it on her lap. "You've worn your steel ones long 
enough."</p>

<p>She took the spectacles from the case, and balanced 
them for a moment in her small, thin hand, as if she were 

<!-- page 44 -->

weighing them, and estimating their value; then, looking 
up at him, she said:</p>

<p>"Gold spectacles, John Maribel! Is this the use to 
which you put old Featherstone's money?"</p>

<p>The ungracious reception of his gift seemed rather to 
amuse John than to cause him any annoyance; for he 
laughingly rejoined:</p>

<p>"Come, aunt, put them on your nose. A very small 
portion of old Featherstone's money went in the purchase; 
and I promise you that you shall not want sugar for your 
tea in consequence of my extravagance. Ah! here's 
Nellie with the tea-kettle. I never was more hungry in,
my life!"</p>

<p>He wheeled the old lady up to the table; for, in consequence 
of a fall, she had not walked for years; and old, 
ugly, fretful, and seemingly ungrateful, Aunt Parrott was 
the recipient of a tenderness almost womanly in its sympathy&mdash;a 
courtesy, emanating from a strong, manly heart, 
which yielded a reverent humility to her age and infirmity, 
showing itself in attention to her bodily wants, not in the 
indulgence of her thousand caprices. John Maribel could 
never have been seen to greater advantage than in contrast 
with the old woman who made his vis-&agrave;-vis at table. 
Perhaps all the sunshine of her life beamed upon her 
from his face. She softened under its influence. No 
one knew this better than Nellie Shea, the much-tried 
and sole domestic of the establishment, who was apt 

<!-- page 45 -->

to wait for Dr. John's presence before preferring a 
request.</p>

<p>Nellie had learned by sad experience to look out for 
traps which were artfully set for her, and which more 
than once had sprung upon her unwary steps. Candles, 
and sugar, and port wine, were supposed by Mrs. Parrott
to be objects of peculiar temptation to the girl; and vanity 
and love of "followers" her crowning weaknesses.</p>

<p>On this occasion Nellie had smartened her usually plain 
attire by a flaming ribbon, which, with utter disregard of 
combination, she had tied about her hair.</p>

<p>John Maribel smiled as he noticed the ill-chosen ornament; 
but Mrs. Parrott was absolutely speechless. She
swallowed a mouthful of toast, the while scanning Nellie
with her keen, black eyes.</p>

<p>"Take care, Nellie Shea!" she said, "your head is most
alarmingly suggestive of inflammability."</p>

<p>"Please, ma'am," answered Nellie, quailing under the 
sarcasm, "I got it as near of a color as I could, that you 
mightn't notice I had it on."</p>

<p>John Maribel broke into a hearty laugh; and Nellie, 
under cover of it, escaped from her inquisitor.</p>

<p>She reappeared in a few moments to say that Dr. John 
was wanted in the office.</p>

<p>He wheeled Mrs. Parrott back to her place beside the
fire; the table containing her books and papers was drawn
up close to her side; and with a tender tone in his deep

<!-- page 46 -->

voice, John said: "Now, aunt, try the new glasses. I
wish I could stay with you a little longer this morning; 
but perhaps this is the paying patient, and we must not 
neglect him."</p>

<p>"Oh, John! If I could but shake off but one seven 
years from these old arms and legs, by the good Gods 
I'd go with you. Pray smooth down your hair, and look 
like what you really are&mdash;a skilful physician."</p>

<p>"I'm sure that I am very grateful and proud of your 
good opinion, aunt. I shall be punctual to dinner."</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">"GUESS AT HER YEARS, I PR'YTHEE."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a hard blow to the young fellow when he 
knew that at the outset of his career he was to 
be shackled by the multiform cares that come 
with responsibility unaided by independence. Fortunately 
for him, a strong, hopeful nature predominated over 
natural discouragement; so that when he received a letter 
from a New York lawyer informing him that an unknown 
aunt, destitute and an invalid, appealed to him for succor, 

<!-- page 47 -->

he set out at once, conscientiously convinced that he was 
performing only a simple duty.</p>

<p>Youth is naturally antagonistic to the selfish exactions 
of age; and John Maribel's life might have been embittered 
had he not possessed, in its outset, faith in a 
problem not yet proved by experience&mdash;that of working 
out his own life to a result, which, puzzling as it might be, 
yet grew plainer day by day, by the exercise of persevering 
reliance on the fortuitous concurrence of those atoms of 
circumstance that often make up the whole of success.
Intellect possesses instincts which urge it to cut loose
from the leading-strings of reason, and some of its most 
brilliant achievements have been accomplished without 
the aid of this timorous adviser.</p>

<p>John Maribel was not wont to appeal to her. The 
warm impulses of his heart rebelled against her prudent 
suggestions, and it may be fairly alleged against him that 
he trusted greatly to the charm of his manner, which, 
in its winning affability, drew out the kindness which 
lurks in every human heart, needing only the magic of 
tone and look to kindle it into active sympathy. No 
one spoke of John Maribel as a handsome man; but 
every face grow brighter in his presence; every care 
seemed lighter under the honest, hearty kindness, which 
perhaps with him was constitutional, but none the less 
effective.</p>

<p>He was peculiarly <i>simpatico</i>, and even Mrs. Parrott

<!-- page 48 -->

melted towards him, when to all the world besides she 
seemed utterly shut out from those gentler emotions which 
we suppose conjoined to goodness. It is quite possible, in 
the perpetual ebb and flow of human life, to come across 
one completely hidden from our understanding, utterly 
unreadable from our point of view. The lonely old 
woman, shut up in John Maribel's house, had determinedly 
turned her back upon all social amenities, and presented 
the aspect of withered, shrunken humanity, embittered 
by long buffeting; by misfortunes of which she
never spoke, and which seemed to have turned all the 
sweetness of her life into the acid of vinegar. Completely 
out of harmony with the uncomely exterior was 
the vivid, restless mind, which lived upon the very best 
intellectual food. She devoured books, and, when she 
chose, she could talk well about them; but it was not 
often her whim to do so. She would sometimes pounce 
upon John with a date or a quotation&mdash;which was as 
likely to be in German or Italian as in English&mdash;and take 
him up roundly on his classics; and on occasion the old 
lady would deal out an epigrammatic sentence which 
actually set his teeth on edge. John's frank, warm nature 
sheltered him, however, from much truculent attack, and 
drew from her almost a reverence for those qualities which 
were strongly in contrast with her own. She was persistently 
silent on the subject of her past life, and John 
Maribel had long ceased to question her, or evince any 

<!-- page 49 -->

curiosity to know more about her than she was willing to
reveal.</p>

<p>Nellie Shea had, contrary to all expectation, remained 
in Mrs. Parrott's service and performed for her the offices 
which her helpless condition demanded. The truth was 
that the constant companionship of the old woman had 
grown familiar to the girl; and she had found out that, 
among the nettles which Mrs. Parrott cultivated, was a 
fair flower which bloomed and gave its fragrance, choked 
as it was by the ranker weeds. It had flourished all unsuspected, 
until one night Nellie discovered its existence.</p>

<p>It was on the night before&mdash;Christmas eve. Mrs. Parrott 
was waiting for John, and Nellie, curled up in a 
corner of the fireplace, had fallen into a light sleep. A 
movement&mdash;a crackling of paper, and she became conscious 
that her mistress was reading a letter. She saw 
the old face shadowed into the softness of grief, the hard 
eyes looking tenderly upon the written characters, and 
when the trembling hands which held the paper fell upon 
her lap, still firmly clasping it, a convulsive spasm passed 
over her face, and tears, actual tears, streamed down her 
furrowed checks. It lasted but a moment; a rigid calm 
succeeded the unwonted agitation, the letter was slowly 
folded and put into her pocket, and she resumed her reading. 
She seemed in a moment wrapt in the mysticism
which symbolizes the characters so exquisitely drawn in 
Hawthorne's "Transformation;" but when at last she 

<!-- page 50 -->

laid the book on the table, she called to Nellie with a 
voice from which all the tartness seemed gone, and, drawing
a silver coin from her parse, said: "Nellie, buy yourself 
a pair of stockings."</p>

<p>With laudable alacrity Nellie went out on the following 
morning, as soon as the shutters were taken down from 
the thread-and-needle store around the corner. The flaming 
ribbon was temptingly displayed in the show-case. She 
really meant to buy the stockings, for her own were sadly
out at heel; but temptation captured her, as it has many
a wiser person, and so Aunt Parrott's money went for 
the ill-judged finery; and she knew it quite well, when 
she withered Nellie at the breakfast table.</p>

<div class="center" id="ch07">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="small">"SIR, IT IS A MYSTERY."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Perry Deane</span> came forward when John Maribel
entered the office, extending his hand with a
manner somewhat reserved, which, however, 
changed at once into easy cordiality under the genial warmth 
of the welcome which John gave him.</p>

<p>"Pray be seated, Mr. Deane. I take it exceedingly kind 
of you to have come this morning."</p>

<!-- page 51 -->

<p>"Really, Doctor, I can't say that you have anything to 
thank me for. You know that to-day is a holiday; and 
to-morrow my time belongs to Mr. Graham."</p>

<p>"None of us are free, for that matter," answered John
Maribel. "Every man is more or less a slave to money-getting, 
and young men like you and me have first to look
to that before we can strike out in an independent way."</p>

<p>"There's a difference," said Perry, "a vast difference, in 
the way of getting it. You, for instance, exercise your own 
faculties uncontrolled, while I am paid so much per day to 
go by rule and measure. My work is set out for me. You 
are not excluded from a fair field of action, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" laughed John, "my field of action is anything 
but a fair one, my good fellow, and most distressingly narrow. 
I almost envy you the active exercise of your muscles; 
it is an excellent way to work off an exuberance of impatient 
ambition."</p>

<p>Perry looked at the bright young fellow with a dubious 
smile. It seemed so hard to connect John Maribel with
anything so unlovely as that scrambling life of hardship that 
was go neatly linked to his own. There are some things that 
are as quickly comprehended by men of plain sense as by 
the most meditative scholar, and Perry Deane saw at 
once that besides the accident of birth, and the greater 
advantage of education, there existed no real barrier to his 
intercourse with John Maribel; that, indeed, there was a 
strong affinity between himself and this young man&mdash;an affinity 

<!-- page 52 -->

of common interest&mdash;a kinship of faculties, the exercise 
of which were perhaps their only weapons against the 
hydra-headed difficulties that were sure to rise up to bar 
their way. It was hardly possible that an Iola&uuml;s would 
be found to smooth it for them.</p>

<p>They talked for a half-hour, and then the patients commenced 
dropping in. Even Christmas does not spare the 
pangs of rheumatism, or relieve teething babies of their ailments. 
So John Maribel and Perry parted; not, however,
without a promise from the latter that he would come
again.</p>

<p>The young physician had gone through the routine of 
prescription with patient earnestness; and as a sugar-coating 
to the nauseous doses prescribed, he threw in a jest 
here, a smile there, and much comfort in the way of pleasant
words. No one went away unsatisfied; no one felt 
quite so ill or so hopeless after seeing John Maribel.</p>

<p>He stood now passing his hands through his hair with 
just a shadow of gravity upon his face. He was poor&mdash;poorer 
to-day than ever, for he had lent Dick Perley ten 
dollars. How could he have refused so small a favor? "And 
there was Kitty! Aunt Parrott would be horrified at this 
new extravagance; but, indeed, it couldn't be helped; it 
was an involuntary charge, but none the less sacred;
and"&mdash;John smiled and gave his hair another thrust&mdash;"she 
is the sweetest angel! It would take so little to buy 
her gowns&mdash;and then there would be no doctor's bills; and 

<!-- page 53 -->

the old overcoat would hold out for the winter, with a new 
lining, and perhaps the rich patient would make his appearance, 
and"&mdash;the wish gave birth to a possibility&mdash;"old 
Mr. Irby might slip on his marble door-steps, and&mdash;good 
gracious! what a wretch am I!" he exclaimed aloud.</p>

<p>"That I deny, Doctor," said a dapper little man, for 
whom Nellie held open the door. "You are neither morally 
nor physiologically correct. I never saw a man look 
less like a wretch than you do at this moment."</p>

<p>Dr. Maribel blushed a good deal as he shook hands with 
Mr. McStebbins, banker. His acquaintance with this gentleman 
was slight, very slight, indeed; and he was not a 
little puzzled to know what brought him to his office. Certainly 
no one could look less like a patient than did Mr. 
McStebbins. He seemed to bear about his elegant, not to
say dainty person, an aroma of affluence and health which 
accorded but little with the shabbiness of the surroundings.
When he had laid off his overcoat and drawn his gloves 
from his delicate hands, he seated himself in the only comfortable 
chair, and thus addressed John Maribel:</p>

<p>"A case of idiosyncratic queerness&mdash;an eccentric old 
fool! I mean," seeing a look of bewilderment on John's 
face, "that you are well rid of old Featherstone's humors."</p>

<p>"I don't see that," replied John, bluntly. "In getting 
rid of his humors I also got rid of his dollars; and it is not 
hard to see," looking around, "that I stand in need of 
them."</p>

<!-- page 54 -->

<p>"You are still young, Dr. Maribel, and can afford to 
wait. Excuse any reference to myself, but I may say that 
at your age my prospects were not more brilliant than are 
yours; yet I flatter myself that fortune has accorded me 
a fair place in her temple; but to business."</p>

<p>John Maribel gave his hair another thrust, and looked 
expectantly at the speaker. Business had a most promising 
sound.</p>

<p>"I have received instructions," continued Mr. McStebbins, 
"to pay you a monthly allowance of thirty 
dollars for the support of the child called Kitty, who has, 
<i>I</i> think, been put upon you in a most unwarrantable 
manner. This allowance is to continue until she reaches 
her majority. I hate mystery, Dr. Maribel, but I believe 
that I must excuse myself from answering the questions 
which it would be perfectly natural for you to ask. When 
I will have handed you this, my instructions will be 
carried out to the letter."</p>

<p>He gave John a folded paper, something so suspiciously 
like a check, that the blood tingled to the end of his 
fingers; nor was he mistaken. It was a check for two 
hundred and fifty dollars.</p>

<p>"Really, I am quite in the dark!" he exclaimed, his 
hand going up to his head.</p>

<p>"It is yours, Dr. Maribel; a miserable bequest from 
a man who might have made you independent without 
marring the large fortune which he has left behind him.

<!-- page 55 -->

It comes, however, very appropriately on Christmas morning; 
and, upon my word, I believe that some genuinely 
good motive induced old Featherstone to give it to you. 
Permit me to offer you my sincere good wishes, and to say 
good morning to you."</p>

<p>He bowed himself out, leaving John with an expression
of bewilderment on his face, which was bordering on the 
ludicrous. He started after the little man, too late, however, 
to redeem his manners, for he was just driving off 
in his coup&eacute;. Then clapping his hat on his head, and forgetting 
his overcoat, he rushed to the grocer's, and gave 
an order for two pounds of the best tea, and the same.
quantity of cut sugar, for Aunt Parrott. This was a cheap 
kind of happiness&mdash;so cheap that it was in the reach of 
almost any one; and yet, cheap as it was, it required the 
exercise of genuine kindness and unusual simplicity of 
heart to obtain it. We cannot laugh at John as he goes 
up the stairs with the bundles, which he had taken from 
the grocer's bay at the door. A great heart is slow to find
out its own worth; indeed, from its depths unsuspected
treasures are ever welling up; and these are so naturally 
appropriated by others, that they seem scarcely to belong 
to their possessor. Selfishness is essentially absorbing. It 
artfully catches the impulses which emanate from a noble 
nature, and turns them to its own advantage. Aunt
Parrott was no exception to this rule. John Maribel's tea 
and sugar were but tea and sugar to her. She accepted 

<!-- page 56 -->

the material comfort, and failed to see the motive that 
idealized the simple gift. John Maribel, to her also, was 
a "good fellow," delightfully ignorant of that worldly 
axiom, "Look out for number one," and consequently he 
was always getting the share of number two.</p>

<div class="center" id="ch08">

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p class="small">"A LADY SO FAIR."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> will pass over the uneventful years of Kitty's 
infancy, to find its fair promise amply fulfilled; 
and as she stands now behind the counter&mdash;for 
she often replaces Mr. Pitkin in the shop&mdash;her refined and 
delicate presence is as evidently incongruous as a rare and 
fragrant exotic would be in a garden of herbs. From a low, 
polished forehead, her blonde hair was gathered into a loose 
knot at the back of her head. Little fluffy curls nestled 
lovingly on the white brow, and contrasted strongly with 
delicately-curved eyebrows, which were several shades 
darker. The eyes were full, and of a deep violet color, 
while the mouth had lost none of the witchery of its infantine 
smile, and with its rounded chin might have 
furnished to Zeuxis a model for his Helen, had she lived 

<!-- page 57 -->

in the days when he borrowed from the fair women of 
Crotona a study for his picture. Added to her charming
face, and tall, well-developed figure, she possessed the inexplicable 
charm which jealous Nature has accorded to so
few women, and which art must ever fail to imitate&mdash;the
mystery of Grace. Her clear, sweet voice was calling now 
to Mr. Pitkin, and the old man, much bent, and thinner 
than in the days when we first made his acquaintance, 
came out from the parlor, saying:</p>

<p>"What's the trouble, deary?"</p>

<p>"It is Nellie, grandfather. She has come with Mrs. 
Parrott's love, to ask me to go there; but I think I had 
better stay; you may need me."</p>

<p>"No, no, child; business is dull enough now. It don't 
require you and me both to look after the shop; and&mdash;where 
is Jope? Off again, I dare say."</p>

<p>"Only to take some packages which had to be sent at 
once, grandfather, I will wait until he returns."</p>

<p>She laid her pretty hand upon the old man's arm, and 
held up her face to him, smiling so artfully, that he forgot 
his irritation&mdash;grown to be chronic with him&mdash;and willingly 
gave his consent to her going.</p>

<p>Kitty had in a great measure taken the place of the 
good mother, from whom they had parted some years before 
with deep and bitter grief. They spoke of her now 
with a remembrance tinctured with pain, but without 
the keen regret of recent bereavement.</p>

<!-- page 58 -->

<p>Kitty sent Nellie off with the answer for Mrs. Parrot,
and then ran up to her little room to change her dress.
Her allowance of pocket-money was sufficient to permit 
her to satisfy her natural taste&mdash;in all respects an excellent 
taste&mdash;in choosing good materials, and having her 
clothes well made. When she again entered the shop, attired 
for walking, a customer turned to gaze at her with 
evident curiosity depicted on his face.</p>

<p>"Your daughter?" [to] Mr. Pitkin.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the old man shortly; for he was chary 
of his words when they went to satisfy questions about 
Kitty.</p>

<p>In the meantime a short, broad-shouldered specimen, of 
the <i>genus</i> boy had entered the shop, and stood with his 
greasy hands stuck into his greasy pockets, gazing at Kitty 
with open-mouthed admiration. Small, light-blue eyes, 
a head of sandy-colored hair, a nose like a mottled knob,
and a wide mouth, with teeth which betrayed an unsparing 
use of tobacco&mdash;such was Jope. Outwardly, an uncouth 
grocer's boy; and yet possessing an abstract principle of 
taste which enabled him to see with other eyes than those
which were now contemplating Kitty, and which contained 
the power of appreciation, and the virtue of a great and 
faithful devotion. Gladly would he have cast himself to 
the earth, and with the humility of a Hindoo devotee have
rejoiced to feel her little foot trampling over him; indeed, 
his imagination often revelled in the possibility of this 

<!-- page 59 -->

Juggernaut feat being performed by Kitty. Doubtless it 
was, metaphorically speaking, by Kitty, and by every one
else; for a boy of this kind is strangely antagonistic to 
the tenderer emotions of the heart, I might even say to 
human sympathy. He is supposed to be as utterly incapable 
of physical suffering or fatigue as he is impervious 
to kindness or gentle treatment; and if by any chance
he gives utterance to his agonized heart, he is rated as an 
"impertinent fellow," and threatened with dismissal. It 
is only a wonder that such boys ever grow up to be honest 
men, much more, marked citizens and successful merchants; 
for such antecedents belong to many of those 
who now wield the power of wealth, and constitute a 
strong and influential element of society.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitkin was rating Jope roundly now, for giving a 
false weight of butter to Nellie Shea.</p>

<p>"You'll be the ruin of the shop. Where were your 
eyes?"</p>

<p>"Looking at her red head, I reckon. Don't you half 
believe what Nellie says about weights. It's them is false, 
and not me."</p> 

<p>This very lucid speech set Kitty laughing; and she 
went off, gayly tripping along, her face shaded by her blue 
gauze veil. It was a long walk to John Maribel's house;
for years had brought not one, but many, rich patients 
to the now thriving physician, and he had sold the old
house and lived quite in the suburbs&mdash;in a pretty cottage, 

<!-- page 60 -->

peering from a garden and facing a lovely bay, whence 
came the fresh breeze blowing inland, perfume-ladened 
and health-bearing. He had changed his residence to 
please Mrs. Parrott, and, with him, this was equivalent to 
pleasing himself.</p>

<p>A shaded pathway ran parallel to the road which 
separated the houses from the beach; and Kitty sauntered 
leisurely along, watching the far-off white sails and thinking 
how fast they were bearing onward towards the 
treacherous ocean&mdash;that ocean that stretched out into 
boundless mystery, and into which the glowing sun seemed 
to be sinking. Kitty did not half understand the voices 
which spoke to her heart; but she listened to them and
tried to catch their meaning. She was led by them towards 
that inexhaustible treasury that opens to those only who 
possess the faculty of seeing and feeling with that sense
which a great intellect has called a sixth sense, and which 
is the inspiration of the beautiful.</p>

<p>The after-glow was dying out of the sky, the mystical 
twilight was creeping over land and sea, and Kitty instinctively 
quickened her steps. </p>

<p>"Kitty, Kitty!" and John Maribel was at her side 
clasping her hand and looking as pleased as only John 
could look.</p>

<p>"I am so glad that you have overtaken me," she said.
"How is it that you are walking to-night?"</p>

<p>"How is it that I find you loitering here at this hour? 

<!-- page 61 -->

Ah! Kitty, you forget that there is some risk in walking 
alone on this road. See that rough-looking man! His
presence should be a warning to you, dear."</p>

<p>"And it will not be forgotten, dear John; but I do 
love this walk, and I am always thinking of its pleasant 
termination."</p>

<p>John Maribel did not answer; he merely stroked the 
little hand that lay so lovingly in his. He was thinking 
that Kitty was the dearest and most beautiful of girls; and 
these thoughts were mingled with the self-reproach which 
came to him with the knowledge that in some way he had 
made a sad mistake. He could not bear to associate this 
fair young creature with the coarse surroundings of her 
home; he could not bear to think that the fancies of her 
bright imagination&mdash;the confused images of beauty&mdash;the
treasures of love, might languish and die out amid the 
coldness and barrenness of her life. She was a creature 
for the sunshine&mdash;a flower to expand under the genial 
influence of a warm, bright life; and here, through his 
mistake, by his stupid blundering, she was as obstinately 
bound to the old grocer as though she were of his own 
flesh and blood. He had made many and unavailing efforts 
to transfer Kitty to his own home; but, with unselfish 
devotion, she persistently refused to leave the old man, and 
honorably kept a promise which she had made to Mother 
Pitkin, to give him a daughter's love and duty. If anything 
could have raised her to a higher pinnacle of perfection

<!-- page 62 -->

in John's eyes, it would have been this heroic 
resolve; but he was none the less bent on her rescue; 
therefore he said:</p>

<p>"Kitty, have you thought over our conversation; or
have you forgotten my request when we last met?"</p>

<p>"No, dear John, I believe I seldom forget anything 
that you say to me."</p>

<p>"Aunt Parrott has grown to love you, as every one
seems to do, for that matter, and you are too sensible, and
far too gentle, to resent her vagaries."</p>

<p>Kitty laughed. She was so accustomed to vagaries in
every phase of septuagenary invention, that an objection 
to Aunt Parrott on that score scarcely stuck her as a 
serious one.</p>

<p>"John," she said, "you are asking me to do the very 
thing that you could never bring yourself to do. You 
know that you are Aunt Parrott's slave; you know that 
you have delivered yourself over to her, to be tormented 
with old Greek tragedies, when you are dying to go to 
bed; and you have actually taken a professor of German 
to please her. Oh! wise Dr. Maribel, you are as easily 
moulded as wax in that old lady's hands."</p>

<p>Women, whether young or old, possess a wonderful 
pertinacity, which hangs on patiently to a man's opposition,
gradually overcoming its resistance, and conquering
at last, when he least intends to yield. The delicate subtlety 
of her tactics is seldom understood by the sterner 

<!-- page 63 -->

sex. She fights with weapons the use of which he does 
not know, and flatters his self-love and vanity by allowing 
him the honors of war, taking care to keep her triumph 
to herself. As John opened the garden gate, he knew 
that Kitty had again conquered; but her delicate appreciation 
of what was best in his own nature softened his 
disappointment.</p>

<p>Aunt Parrott looked as if she had not moved her position 
in all these years. There she was, cloak and all, just 
the same quaint old woman, wizened and shrivelled, but 
with the clear, sharp eyes that Nellie Shea had been heard 
to say pierced like cambric needles. The comparison was
forcible, but altogether imaginative. To judge from Miss 
Shea's garments, she know little, practically, of the pricks 
of cambric, or any other kind of needles.</p>

<p>Kitty drew a chair up to the table at Mrs. Parrott's 
elbow, and John, on the other side, sat looking quite happy
and satisfied; but now that we see him with the light 
falling on his face, we perceive that there is a change&mdash;a
change of seventeen years&mdash;seventeen years of those experiences 
which, to a physician more than to any other 
man, are apt to be varied, and often painful. The face 
had lost somewhat of its fresh coloring, and the flexible 
mouth did not form itself into a smile so readily as of 
yore. He was thirty-nine years old&mdash;a young looking 
man, it was said, for his age. Life's problem was being 
gradually worked out; and, it must be confessed, that

although the sum of experience was growing large, and he 
had cast it up again and again, the result continued to be 
far from satisfactory.</p>

<p>Love, in its healthful development, imparts to life its 
greatest charm. The tenderness which a great heart yields 
to a gentler, weaker creature, beautifies it and makes it
the archetype of a purer love&mdash;draws it nearer to the 
divine source whence emanates its highest form. How 
cold and compassionless a machine is man, when untouched 
by this divine fire&mdash;when uninspired by genuine and unselfish 
love. To John Maribel any other was impossible.
He looked earnestly at Kitty as she talked to Mrs. Parrott, 
and the flush of a dear hope&mdash;the whisper of a possibility&mdash;brightened 
his loving eyes.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p class="small">"I AM OLD AND FOOLISH."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parrott</span> loved flowers; every morning 
she was wheeled into the garden to watch Nellie 
cut the roses which profusely adorned the 
room, and always formed a graceful centre-piece for the 
table. Flowers are God's messages. We read them in

<!-- page 65 -->

their exquisite colors; we trace upon their dainty petals
the marvel of His handiwork; we breathe their fragrance,
and remember whence it comes. Gather the pale primrose, 
the azured harebell, the delicate blush-rose, and the 
perfumed violet, and tell me if you do not see in their 
perfection an evidence of God's love; for surely in this 
great, bright, beautiful world, teeming with wonders and 
pregnant with His care for us, nowhere is it more lovingly 
expressed than in the gift of flowers.</p>

<p>Aunt Parrott's teas were real feasts for Kitty. She 
laughed and chatted, and was irresistibly amusing, and 
Nellie applauded with all her heart. She had hardly 
fathomed the philosophy of humor; but, like many of her 
race, she was keenly alive to its power, and Kitty, all unwittingly, 
was often delightfully droll, and tossed about 
her words without the slightest idea that she sometimes 
hit upon an antithesis. The kernel of humor lies in this 
nutshell; the crackers which we must use to get at it is
antithesis. Use the crackers skilfully, and the result is&mdash;a 
laugh; and a laugh, like a glass of good old wine, exhilarates 
the spirits, warms the heart, and puts us on a
better footing with ourselves and everybody else.</p>

<p>The room opened on a verandah, and the repast over, 
John Mariel wheeled out Aunt Parrott, and Kitty drew 
a rustic chair close beside her, and said:</p>

<p>"Now, Aunt Parrott, John, of course, is going to leave 
us, for in all probability he will have been sent for by 

<!-- page 66 -->

Mrs. Payne. What a comfort it must be to John to think
that in her he has a never-failing patient. As long as 
her nerves hold out, she will play upon them to the tune 
of invalidism in all its variations."</p>

<p>"Well, dear, so much the better for John. I have 
always maintained that medicine is not a positive science&mdash;I
don't speak of surgery&mdash;and that it admits of much
latitude in its practice. A doctor has to defer to the 
imagination of his patients, which is indulged in proportion 
as their means enable them to gratify it. Such patients, 
of course, are a godsend to physicians, and we 
must not quarrel with John's bread and butter."</p>

<p>"I wish he could get them from some other source to-night." </p>

<p>Mrs. Parrott had not heard Kitty's words. Her keen 
glance was fixed upon a mass of foliage forming a thick 
<i>bosquet</i> on the left of the house. She withdrew it with a 
nervous movement, and looked at Kitty with a strange, 
furtive expression. Once she started so violently that her 
fan and handkerchief fell to the floor. There was something 
weird in the pale face with the moonlight shining 
upon it. Kitty felt uncomfortable under the silence of 
the usually garrulous old woman, and wished heartily for 
John's return. Mrs. Parrott turned suddenly in her 
chair, and said:</p>

<p>"How is it, my dear, that you prefer to stay with old 
Pitkin, when you might come here?"</p>

<!-- page 67 -->

<p>"Aunt Parrott, I am sure that I need not say to you 
that there are higher motives than inclination. While 
grandfather lives, I will never voluntarily leave him."</p>

<p>"Grandfather!" cried Mrs. Parrott in a tone of contempt, 
unconsciously bitter at thought of the old man.</p>

<p>A scarlet flush mantled Kitty's brow, and her voice
quivered with emotion as she answered:</p>

<p>"It is my misfortune to be able to claim no other relationship; 
and I take it to be unkind of you, Aunt Parrott, 
to arouse a doubt of its genuineness, unless," she added 
eagerly, "you can satisfy me that I am somebody else's 
grandchild."</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrott, with a quick motion, placed her hand 
over Kitty's mouth. "Never ask me that, child. I know 
nothing; I am a foolish old woman; don't mind what I
say." </p>

<p>Her agitation alarmed Kitty into forgetting her own
deep concern. "Forgive me, pray forgive me, Aunt Parrott, 
if I have pained you. You know how much we love 
you&mdash;John and I."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; God bless John Maribel! He has saved 
me from a wicked old age. How unfailing an invigorator 
and sweetener is his kindness!"</p>

<p>Her sharp features softened, her voice grow low and 
tender, as she continued: "I am a poor old woman, crying 
over baffled hopes. As long as hope is left to us, dear, 
we have always something to live for. I have reached 

<!-- page 68 -->

that period when it has turned into ashes. And now I've 
spoiled your evening for you, and it is as much as old 
people ever do, when they forget that they have no right
to rob the young of one moment of their fleeting happiness. 
What keeps John, I wonder? Ah! I hear his 
buggy-wheels."</p>

<p>Kitty was already on her way down the garden path to 
meet John.

<div class="center" id="ch10">

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

<p class="small">"THOU MY SOMETIME DAUGHTER."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ah!</span> John, I am so glad that you have come."</p>

<p>"What has occurred, darling? You look as 
white as a ghost."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that Aunt Parrott is not well, John. You 
can't imagine how her words and manner have startled 
me."</p>

<p>John Maribel looked towards the old woman, sitting so 
still, and quickened his pace; but Mrs. Parrott had quite 
recovered her wonted calmness, and Kitty went off to 
get her wrappings, while he sat down beside her.</p>

<p>"I've just had a call, Aunt Parrott, to go to Worleigh," 
he said. "A gentleman was waiting at the gate for me&mdash;quite 
an elegant-looking personage&mdash;who was urgent that 

<!-- page 69 -->

I should set out at once. Some accident has occurred 
there. Worleigh, you remember, is the residence of Hugh
Wilbraham; and Perry has been employed there for the 
past year making repairs. I must, of course, go; but 
first I will accompany Kitty home. You are not well, 
Aunt Parrott!" he exclaimed, remarking the extreme
pallor of her face.</p>

<p>"I am perfectly well, John, perfectly well. You have a 
good ten miles' ride before you, and no time to lose."</p>

<p>Her manner reassured him; and as Kitty was ready, 
they said good-night, leaving her sitting there; for she 
had refused to go in. The moon hung low over the bay. 
The mingled wave and moonlit horizon gave that hint of 
infinity which comes with widespread waters. The stillness 
was broken by the footsteps only of a belated pedestrian 
or the rumble of a chance vehicle. Such was the 
position of things&mdash;Nellie napping in the dining-room, and 
her mistress musing in her chair. From long habit Nellie 
awoke at the slightest word from her mistress; and she 
was too accustomed to her caprices to feel surprised at her 
determination to sit up later than usual. So she made 
herself comfortable in an arm-chair, and slept contentedly, 
while the garden-gate opened, and a woman came
swiftly up the path, clearly defined in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"Agatha, Agatha! my daughter, you have come to me 
after all these long, weary years."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, at last! I have waited for this hour. 

<!-- page 70 -->

I owed so much to you that I should not come back an 
outcast. I have been tempted a thousand times to break 
my compact. Well is it for me I have the will to quench 
the volcano of passion which burns within my breast. I 
admit that I have done much wrong; but my punishment 
has been heavy, and the cruel world has not helped me 
to bear it patiently. Dared I revenge myself upon it 
now, I would throw back its deceitful adulation&mdash;its mean 
sycophancy; I would give it scorn for smiles, and show it
that the glamour of success has not made me forgetful of
its past treachery. I reign now, where once I was a supplicant; 
and no tyrant is so merciless as he who has once 
been a slave. The one pure joy of my life was snatched 
from me by the cruelty of him who, out of very pity for 
my desolate misery, might have shown me mercy."</p>

<p>She had risen to her feet, her slight figure quivering 
with excitement, and her face glowing with an almost tragic 
beauty.</P>

<p>"Like a tigress watching for her stolen offspring, so I 
lay in wait for her," she continued, "and I saw her&mdash;I 
saw the fair, young face&mdash;I heard the sweet, pure voice 
saying: 'Dear John, how good you are.' The sound of 
that voice has aroused within me all the unsated yearning 
of motherhood." She paused a moment and then added 
with bitter irony: "This <i>good</i> John Maribel has well 
fulfilled his charge, don't you think so? I have come, 
mother, as I did once before, to ask you to help me.

<!-- page 71 -->

You have played your part nobly, generously to me; 
for I comprehend what it costs to a soul like yours 
to lend itself to deception; and if ever a means justifies 
an end, surely the salvation of a young life ought to 
do it. You know that this excitable, nervous organization 
of mine is tremulously alive to the impressions of the 
moment; but my gratitude to you is something more than 
the vibration of the nerves. It is more truly the vibration 
of that chord of affection, which must awaken a response 
in your heart. Trained by you, Kitty has been 
saved from the consequences of old Featherstone's revengeful 
hate; and to look at her, one would scarcely suspect 
that she had been nurtured amid the vulgar surroundings 
of the shop. Thank God that she has been saved from 
the vulgarity engendered by low association! Now, perfect 
your work, mother, and help me; I have plans for her.
I have marked out a brilliant career for her and &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

"Agatha! Agatha! take care; your hot wilfulness will 
lead you into danger. Leave the child where she is. Has 
your experience not taught you that there is an inexorable 
justice which metes out to us the portion of the harvest 
which we ourselves have sown? Leave Kitty where 
she is. Believe me, there is danger in tampering with the 
conditions which have so long bound you. Wait, my 
daughter, with sustaining patience. Comfort will come 
to you in the end."</p>

<p>"Do not attempt to turn me with these remonstrances!

<!-- page 72 -->

Do you suppose that I, who have sold my life's happiness 
for old Featherstone's money, will do aught to risk its
loss? Kitty once an heiress, my triumph will be complete. 
You say that she is safer where she is. Is John
Maribel more than man, that he should be insensible to 
her beauty? I tell you, it does not suit me. Do you heed 
me? It must never be."</p>

<p>"Agatha, you have tried me sorely! What would you 
have me do?"</p>

<p>"Oh! to think of her," she cried, evading a direct
answer, "yielding her sweet duty and affection to crabbed 
old Pitkin. Why could not John Maribel have given
her to you?"</p>

<p>"Because he deemed me unfitted for the charge. When 
he brought the forlorn child away from Stony-hill, I doubt 
much whether the thought of placing her in my care ever 
entered his mind. There was a palpable incongruity 
between the pretty little creature and an old and fretful 
woman like me. He did what was far better for her; he 
surrounded her with an atmosphere of love. She has been 
brought up in sunshine, and thus expanded, like a beautiful 
flower, drinking in its life from a genial source. Trifle 
not, Agatha, with those pure and noble sentiments which 
are her best safeguards."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Agatha, impatiently, "have done, 
I beseech you. Catherine Featherstone has been Kitty 
Pitkin long enough."</p>

<!-- page 73 -->

<p>"Surely you do not mean, after all these years of submission, 
to forfeit your compact with Mr. Featherstone? 
Think of the consequences to Kitty!"</p>

<p>"You do not comprehend me. There are reasons which 
must forever separate me from the acknowledged affection 
of my child; and my precautions are duly taken. Look 
at me," she exclaimed, letting fall the light shawl which 
covered her person, and concealed the richness of her 
dress, "The Mistress of Worleigh can surely invite 
whom she pleases to her house."</p>

<p>Mr. Parrott was speechless for a moment; and then, in 
a frightened, tremulous whisper, she asked:</p>

<p>"Agatha, have you done <i>that?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p> 

<p>There was silence between them. The old woman sat
with bent head and hands clasped, waiting to hear more, 
as the younger one stood looking at her. At last, she laid 
her jewelled hand upon the poor, old, trembling fingers, 
and said:</p>

<p>"You are grieved; I knew you would be. I did it for 
Kitty's sake; for I do not love the man; but his wealth 
was necessary to me. Poverty makes a fiend of me. 
Rich dresses, and jewels, and ease, and luxury mean to me, 
as they do to many others, an absence of temptation; and 
the natural sequence&mdash;a pleasant and easy method to learn 
to be good. It is growing late, I must say good-night. Our 
plans have worked admirably; for Dr. Maribel is now on 

<!-- page 74 -->

his way to Worleigh, and I shall find him there to-morrow 
morning. Babet, my French maid, has only a sprained 
ankle; but she will have followed my directions but 
poorly should she not succeed in detaining the doctor 
until my arrival. Be prepared for a description of the 
charming and <i>spirituelle</i> Mrs. Wilbraham.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">" 'It made the laughter of an afternoon<br/>

That Vivien should attempt the blameless King.' "</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"I know full well," answered Mrs. Parrott, "that the 
first thought of your fascinated victims is one of admiration 
for those qualities which are the more dangerous 
because you use them to cover the real bitterness of your 
contempt for them. John Maribel deserves better at your 
hands."</p>

<p>"Good-night," she answered, stooping and kissing the 
old lady. "John Maribel is safe from my wiles; but he 
must not thwart me."</p>

<p>There was a faint odor of <i>bouquet de violette</i>, another light 
kiss on the brow, and Mrs. Parrott was left alone.</p>

<p>"Nellie's slumbers had been troubled by the sound of 
voices. She was fully sensible of a presence which was not 
there when her eyes closed; and the impression was intensified 
by a dream, which so terrified her that, with hair 
standing on end, and wild, dilated eyes, she rushed out on 
the verandah, just in time to see Agatha flitting down the 
garden path.</p>

<!-- page 75 -->

<p>"Oh, Lord, ma'am! I've had such a turn! My head's 
that gone that I don't know as I am on it or my heels; 
and if I ain't gone blind, I see somebody going down
the walk."</p>

<p>"Fie on you, Nellie Shea! You have had a bad dream.
I warrant that you ate pork and cabbage at dinner."</p>

<p>"So I did, ma'am, and so I have many and many's the 
time before; but it never had the effect of making me see 
a woman going out of the gate. God help me, if pork and 
cabbage is going to make me see visions!"</p>

<p>"I tell you," exclaimed Mrs. Parrott, "that you've had 
a bad dream, girl. The impression was still upon you when 
you came out here. I have no patience dealing with unreasonable 
people. Wheel me in; I will go to bed."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p class="small">"WHAT ARE YOU? A GENTLEMAN."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> jaded horses were slowly toiling up the last 
hill before reaching the stretch of level road that, 
bordered on each side by fences covered with 
Cherokee roses, led to the entrance of Worleigh. Long 
streaks of red and orange light began to shoot up from the 

<!-- page 76 -->

east <i>avant-courriers</i> of day, and the stars paled in the flood
of glory that illumined the sky and gave to nature a
thousand varied tints from hill and dale.  Awakening life
greeted another day; and bird and beast sent forth, in 
their own peculiar language, a joyful recognition of its return. 
It was not so gladly welcomed by the occupants of 
the carriage. They had hoped to reach the house before 
the servants were astir; for although they had gone to 
town the day before, ostensibly to attend a ball, they were 
not quite sure but that the peculiar inquisitiveness of the
negro, and his cunning sagacity, might not have divined
another purpose. Mrs. Wilbraham pulled the check-string.</p>

<p>"I will send the carriage directly to the stable, Gaston.
The early freshness tempts me to walk; and then I 
may be fortunate enough to reach my room without 
meeting Eleanor. I can't bear her looks when she disapproves." </p>

<p>Stepping from the carriage, she ordered the coachman 
to drive on, and walking quickly by the side of her companion, 
they struck into a forest path, crossing a rustic 
bridge which spanned a limpid creek that formed a 
boundary to the grounds of Worleigh.</p>

<p>Here nature had been left to her free energies. Towering 
in their primitive shapes, the forest trees, with arching 
limbs, embowered the old-fashioned mansion, rising from 
an eminence and separated by a terraced garden in front 

<!-- page 77 -->

from a lawn gradually sloping to the stream. Its course, 
running for some distance parallel to the fence, made a 
d&eacute;tour, entering the grounds, where, chastened not destroyed, 
the rich luxuriance of its banks gave to the climbing 
vines free scope to wreathe their graceful festoons 
over the clear waters, which meandered their way, sometimes 
concealed by the thickets from sight, again to burst 
in gladness on the view, until gathered in an ample basin, 
whose margin combined the useful with the picturesque. 
A rustic arbor stood on the grass-covered bank of the 
stream, with steps leading down to the water. It formed 
a most delightful retreat during the heat of summer day, 
with the hum of the bees in the woodbine and the gurgling 
of water over the pebbles. Within this inviting 
bower Agatha sought a temporary retreat to compose her 
thoughts and to recuperate from the exhaustion of a walk
too rapid for a <i>physique</i> naturally frail and excitable.</p>

<p>Her companion stood leaning against the door. There 
was that in his glance which told her the thought which 
had intensified it. She suffered under it that pang which 
comes to a woman when she recognizes for the first time 
the searching look which grows critical as the warmth of 
love or admiration begins to die out. It is a fatal moment 
to her.</p>

<p>"It will never do, Agatha, thus to agitate yourself, 
You really look ghastly."</p>

<p>She rose with a quick movement, drawing her shawl 

<!-- page 78 -->

closely around her figure, and as she passed by him she 
said:</p>

<p>"<i>Je ne sais que trop quels tourments je me pr&eacute;pare</i>."</p>

<p>Miss Eleanor Wilbraham was an early riser; she was 
standing on the piazza when Agatha came up the steps. 
A "Good morning, Eleanor," and she flitted by before the 
good lady had time to administer the words of caution and 
advice as to the best manner of counteracting the effects 
of a night of dissipation, which her sister-in-law's extreme
pallor naturally suggested. Mr. de Rousy, who had been
for some time a privileged guest at Worleigh, came smilingly 
forward, extending his hand, saying:</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Eleanor, you are early this morning."</p>

<p>Miss Eleanor received De Rousy's salutation with just 
that tinge of <i>hauteur</i> in her manner which, to a woman of 
her high breeding, was the only mode that good manners 
suggested in expressing disapprobation. It is a curious 
anomaly that persons essentially pure-minded are apt to 
foster in the inner chambers of their minds a latent suspicion 
of vice, which keeps them constantly guarded by a 
modest defiance, and leaves them little latitude for the 
exercise of charity. In Miss Eleanor's case a marked bias 
of prejudice warped her opinions in regard to foreigners 
in general, and of Gaston de Rousy in particular. He 
was, as he acknowledged, a Franco-American; but this 
only made matters worse with Miss Eleanor. She could 
not forgive him his French father, his French manners, 

<!-- page 79 -->

and, least of all, his presence at Worleigh and his intimacy 
with her brother's wife. Now, as the world goes, this 
intimacy was perfectly natural between persons of close 
consanguinity&mdash;cousins in the first degree, for instance&mdash;and 
there was positively nothing at which Miss Eleanor 
could take umbrage, except that under the new <i>r&eacute;gime</i>
established by Mrs. Wilbraham, obsolete rules and antiquated 
ideas of propriety had been set aside, and the simple 
plantation life broken upon by foreign habits and&mdash;foreign 
morals.</p>

<p>Now Miss Eleanor carried about with her as <i>argent 
mignon</i> her family pride, and as it was continually jingling 
in her ears, it may be supposed that it acted as a 
constant reminder, and kept her on the <i>qui-vive</i> for some 
dereliction on the part of her brother's wife from those 
rules of strict propriety which, like the laws of the 
Medes and Persians, had hitherto been considered inviolable 
in the Wilbraham family. When we will have made 
the reader more fully acquainted with Agatha and Mr. de 
Rousy we think that he will admit that this gentle southern 
matron was led a most uncomfortable life between 
them.</p>

<p>Gaston de Rousy was a man of the world, and possessed 
in a high degree that knowledge of it which, taken in its 
"widest signification, in the knowledge of civilized humanity."</p>

<p>By the Chinese, physiognomy is recognized as evidence 

<!-- page 80 -->

in courts of justice; and with this remote authority I will 
attempt to describe the <i>personnel</i> of Mr. de Rousy, in 
order that my readers may judge for themselves and form 
their own opinions.</p>

<p>His eyes, full, black and expressive&mdash;a deal too much 
so on occasion&mdash;were set a little too near to a nose which 
was inclined to the aquiline. His lips, curving handsomely 
outward, displayed a row of brilliant teeth when he smiled, 
as you may be sure he did on every possible occasion, and
these smiles worked admirably in concert with his eyes. 
The forehead was high on the temples; but this defect was 
remedied by the arrangement of his hair. A tall, graceful 
figure and a gentleman's taste in dress, which means a 
simplicity which shuns extravagance, but courts elegance, 
and you have Mr. Gaston de Rousy. His was an air of 
suave self-possession, and in the drawing-room easily 
gained an ascendancy, pleasing by those arts acquired by 
contact with the world, and dealing in the <i>persiflage</i> which 
often passes current for better wit. Men rarely took to 
him, because it required but little discrimination to discover 
an utter lack of those principles which they are apt
to look for in one of their sex. A worshipper at the 
shrine of the <i>Diva Moneta</i>, he propitiated her unscrupulously; 
skilled, it was said, in a marvellous manipulation 
of cards, which helped him to the indulgence of extravagant 
tastes and compelled a frequent change of residence. 
During a life of adventurous exploits, some of them reflecting 

<!-- page 81 -->

hazardously upon his character, he had acquired a 
perfect knowledge of English, French, and German; and 
being a true cosmopolitan, could adapt himself surprisingly 
to each of these nationalities. Now that he was enjoying 
the privileges of a guest at Worleigh, this adaptability 
won for him the good-will and hospitality of the neighboring 
families. To have seen him with a huge palmetto hat, 
walking through the fields with Col. Covington, one would
have declared that he looked the country gentleman to 
perfection. Miss Eleanor, however, could not be caught 
by the chaff which he so dexterously threw, and disliked 
him as cordially as it was in her power to dislike any one.
More than once was she tempted to remonstrate with 
Agatha for permitting him the privilege of relationship, 
so sure was she that it would be highly distasteful to her 
brother; but Agatha quietly snubbed poor Miss Eleanor, 
and held her sceptre all the more firmly for the protests 
against her authority, which, if only implied, were none
the less irritating to her. She was daily made sensible, 
by those infinitesimal atoms of domestic annoyance which 
worry and sting with the pertinacity of a swarm of gnats, 
that her husband's sister considered her unfit for the responsible 
duties of a Southern mistress. Indeed, Miss
Eleanor deplored what she considered her brother's infatuation; 
for, with the intuition of love, she saw deeply 
into the heart of this woman whom her brother brought 
to Worleigh, vouchsafing her no explanation of his sudden 

<!-- page 82 -->

marriage and leaving her in utter ignorance of his wife's 
family connections. With the advent of this new wife 
had commenced a reign of extravagance that subverted 
completely the economical and prudent sway which, for 
so many years, had governed the household at Worleigh. 
Miss Eleanor deferred, with what grace she might, to the 
fact that her brother's passion for the fascinating Circe
bound him as a willing slave under the magic of the 
draught which she held to his lips.</p>

<p>It is a serious cause for pity that a young man should 
be his master at an age when the bit and bridle, with a 
very strong curb, are needed to quiet his paces. With a 
large estate, a handsome person, and talent far above the 
average order, Hugh Wilbraham had all these advantages. 
Marred by an impressionable organization, which had led 
him into the fatal error of marrying a woman versed in 
all the arts of a <i>femme du monde</i>, and one, too, whose experience 
was superior to his own, inasmuch as there was 
a marked disparity of years between them, the difference, 
unfortunately, being on the woman's side.</p>

<p>About this period of our writing, Mr. Wilbraham had 
been suddenly called from home on public business, and 
Mrs. Wilbraham had pleaded a state of delicate health as
a reason for her unwillingness to face the trials of an ocean 
voyage. The development of our story will show that she 
had far deeper and more serious reasons for declining to 
accompany her husband. He was essentially a gentleman, 

<!-- page 83 -->

belonging to that class of landed proprietors distinguished 
for noble hospitality, culture, and refinement. These, as a
class, are as distinct from the <i>nouveaux riches</i> of to-day 
as are the fungi appropriately called by the ancients 
"children of the earth," to mark their obscure origin, 
distinct from the aged oak from whose decay they derive 
existence&mdash;a class that still retain with their noble 
poverty the pride which led them unflinchingly to sacrifice 
their ancestral estates, and enables them now to bear with 
uncomplaining patience the spite of adverse fate.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

<p class="small">"LOOK, HERE'S THY LOVE!"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. de Rousy</span> bowed himself away, and Miss 
Eleanor, with sun-bonnet and garden gloves, 
went out among her flowers. Roderick, the 
Scotch gardener, justly prided himself upon his roses, and 
on that particular morning the garden was brilliant and 
gorgeous with the rarest varieties of this queen of flowers. 
Regally they sat upon their stems, the revivifying sunlight 
brightening the matchless colors and mellowing the exquisite 
perfumes. In laying out this garden, Roderick had 
discarded all trickery of human invention, and depended 

<!-- page 84 -->

mainly on the glorious hues of the flowers and the graceful 
forms of plants and shrubs as the chief adornment.
Reluctantly he proceeded to make Miss Eleanor's bouquet, 
and although he had done it every morning for several 
years, from the early spring to the latest days of autumn, 
he always cut his flowers under protest.</p>

<p>"Ane wadna be uncivil," he said, "to the mistress;
but I ken sma' profit in cutting the flowers, when there's 
no siller to get for them."</p>

<p>Miss Eleanor had taken the flowers from his hand, and 
was slowly retracing her footsteps towards the house, when 
she espied two men crossing the lawn. One wore a workman's 
apron and carried a box of tools, his tall, well-knit 
form towering slightly above his companion, who was 
talking eagerly to him. Eleanor readily guessed the 
stranger to be Dr. Maribel; for, being short-sighted, she 
could not distinguish his features. Calling to Roderick, 
she said:</p>

<p>"Who is that with Perry Deane?"</p>

<p>"Troth, ma'am, I canna weel say, if it's not the doctor 
come to see that puir thing, Babet."</p>

<p>"So, they sent all the way to town for Dr. Maribel!
We never needed the doctor before for finger aches; and a 
basin of cold water was all that was wanted for Babet's 
foot."</p>

<p>Miss Eleanor inwardly apostrophized Babet as a piece 
of French millinery and affectation, whose honesty was 

<!-- page 85 -->

more than doubtful, and whose wiles and flattery were 
simply disgusting. One Nancy, who had been reared for 
the purpose of filling the place of lady's maid to "Mas'
Hugh's wife," was a pet of Miss Eleanor's, and Mrs.
Wilbraham's persistency in keeping the Frenchwoman, to 
the detriment of Nancy, was a sore and grievous injustice 
in her eyes. She gave another glance at the two men, 
who were passing around the house, going towards the 
stables, which were in course of erection; then she went 
in to place her flowers in vases&mdash;a task which she delegated 
to no other hands.</p>

<p>In the meantime John Maribel and Perry Deane had 
reached the temporary shed under which Perry's workbench 
stood; and John, seating himself on a corner of it,
went on with what he was saying, while Perry prepared to 
commence his work.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Perry, it won't do. Your staying here, 
performing the task of a common workman, and getting no 
better wages, is but one form of folly."</p>

<p>"I don't see as I have any right to complain, Doctor. 
It was optional with me to come or not, and I chose to 
come."</p>

<p>His face was slightly flushed, and there was that tinge
of embarrassment in his manner which the consciousness 
of reservation communicated.</p>

<p>John Maribel looked intently at him for a moment, and 
then said: "You have always stood in your own light, 

<!-- page 86 -->

Perry. When I've wanted you to cut loose from old 
Graham, you have obstinately refused, alleging as your 
reason for continuing in his employ that you were too 
poor a man to risk competition; but your real reason was 
that you were too proud to borrow of me. Am I not 
right?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know, Doctor, that I've always been against 
borrowing, though I don't know but that I could have 
paid you; still my mind is easier to go on in the old way 
until something better turns up. I sha'n't be through 
here before fall, and, before Mr. Wilbraham went away, 
he was saying something to me about work that is wanted 
at Col. Covington's. If I can get the job, I've half a mind 
to quit Graham, who has been getting rich, while I've 
hardly enough laid up to bury me if I should fall off the 
roof of that stable to-day, I've a mind to stay about here
as long as I am sure of work. It's a different thing 
dealing with gentlemen and such folks as old Graham; but 
Mr. Wilbraham made the contract with him, and I was 
sent to superintend the work. I have had as much to do as 
any of the men, and get very little more than they do."</p>

<p>"Well, Perry, old fellow," answered John Maribel, 
"just put your pride out of the way, and remember, whenever 
you need it, that I have a hundred or so to spare. 
By-the-by, where are you staying?"</p>

<p>It was an idle question, suggested to Dr. Maribel most 
probably by the fact that he had encountered Parry on 

<!-- page 87 -->

the outskirts of the grounds, whither he had wandered, 
urged by curiosity to explore a place which was noted for 
being under a higher degree of culture than was usually 
found in the homes of the planters. He was, therefore, 
unprepared for the effect of his words. Perry let fall his 
measure; and if stooping to pick it up produced the vivid 
flush on his face, the same reason could scarcely have been 
assigned for the excessive awkwardness of his manner, as, 
with a glance at Dr. Maribel, he answered, "My quarters 
are up at Hillside, at Squire Blackwell's."</p>

<p>This would have satisfied Dr. Maribel, who was far 
from guessing that Perry had anything to conceal from 
him, had not the notes of a clear, rich, contralto voice, 
coming from the forest-road, back of the stables, produced 
an increased embarrassment, which resulted in an accident;
for Perry cut his finger with the chisel; while the 
singer, appearing now in sight, suddenly ceased her song, 
and drawing her sun-bonnet over her face, passed without 
apparently noticing the two men who were gazing after her.</p>

<p>The intuition of true delicacy helps to guard the sacredness 
of a surprised secret. It was therefore perfectly 
natural that Dr. Maribel should have said good-by to 
Perry with an air of consciousness, while Perry was too 
truly ashamed of himself to do more than return the handshake.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the cause of all this perturbation had found 
her way into the kitchen, where, seating herself near the 

<!-- page 88 -->

door, she took off her sun-bonnet, revealing the bright, 
handsome face of Squire Blackwell's daughter.</p>

<p>"How's your ma, Abby?" said Sabra, the cook, wiping 
her hands on her apron preparatory to presenting one of 
them to Abby; for the negro has a code of etiquette to 
which he holds as rigidly as does the elegant habitu&eacute; of 
the <i>grand monde</i> to the rules and regulations dictated by 
the capricious sovereign, Fashion. It is manifested, in 
the negro I mean, by an extreme anxiety for the health 
and welfare of the family in question, being rarely exhausted
until every member of it has had a fair share of 
notice.</p>

<p>"Well, thank you, Sabra, ma she's but poorly," answered 
Abby; "not much account to do anything; but 
she managed to get around yesterday and pick up a sharp 
lot of eggs; so I fetched them down to Miss Eleanor with 
the butter."</p>

<p>"Thank de Lord, you did! Our hens don't lay 'cording 
to the feed they gets."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you, Sabra," said Miss Eleanor, 
appearing at the pantry door, "that we have a most ungrateful 
lot of hens. Good-morning, Abby; I'm glad that 
you have brought us some eggs."</p>

<p>Abby took up her basket, and followed Miss Eleanor 
into the pantry.</p>

<p>"Count the eggs, my child, I will call Spencer to 
weigh the butter."</p>

<!-- page 89 -->

<p>One by one the white, transparent eggs were carefully 
transferred from the basket to the earthen bowl which 
had been placed to receive them, while the color deepened 
on Abby's checks, as she felt that Miss Eleanor's eyes 
rested upon her with a deeper scrutiny than was altogether 
pleasant&mdash;an anticipatory uncomfortableness, such as we
experience before swallowing a dose of medicine. The
principle of faith in good advice is strong in the minds of 
middle-aged persons, and Miss Eleanor was no exception 
to the rule. She classed it with those remedies which 
work a cure by constant application. When the basket 
stood ready&mdash;for a bottle of Madeira and other delicacies 
had been put in for Mrs. Blackwell&mdash;and Spencer had returned 
to his duties in the dining-room, Miss Eleanor 
laid her hand on Abby's arm, and said:</p>

<p>"Your father's long and faithful service, my child, and 
his devotion to our family, would be but poorly repaid 
should I fail to point out to you those dangers which 
menace youth, but which are doubly perilous to a handsome, 
and, I fear, a giddy girl. We have strangers and 
foreigners here, Abby&mdash;people, who hold lightly what we 
consider of the highest importance. I think you understand 
me. I hear that Mr. de Rousy has been to the 
farm; that he makes it convenient to stop there when he 
goes out gunning."</p>

<p>"La! Miss, who could have told you that he stopped 
there to see me?"</p>

<!-- page 90 -->

<p>"My experience, from long observation of people's 
motives, leads me to doubt whether he lingered at your 
house for an hour last Thursday for the pleasure of your 
mother's society. Young men are not apt to find such 
society enticing."</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Eleanor, I declare I never said a dozen 
words to him."</p>

<p>"That may be very true, Abby, and I would advise a 
like reserve in future; but I strongly suspect that the 
object of his visit was as fully attained without your taking 
part in the conversation."</p>

<p>"You needn't be uneasy about me, Miss Eleanor," 
she answered, as she tied on her bonnet. "I'll be down
again next week; and ma will be glad of the wine. Good-by."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p class="small">"I LONG TO HAVE SOME CHAT WITH HER."</p>

</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"A purblind race of miserable men,<br/>

How many among us at this very hour<br/>

Do forge a life-long trouble for ourselves."</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> so did John Maribel, by taking "false for 
true."</p>

<p>Agatha Wilbraham, with the <i>agaceries</i> of an
accomplished actress, sought out the ever ready and 

<!-- page 91 -->

generous impulses of his nature, and worked upon 
them with so subtle and delicate a skill, that he yielded 
his sober judgment to her capricious will, as many had 
done before him. Men are not wiser to-day than were those 
ancient heroes&mdash;passengers aboard the good ship Argo; 
and they will throw themselves into the sea, metaphorically, 
with the same headlong readiness as did Butes, to reach 
the flowery isle of the Sirens&mdash;whether in Greek drapery, 
crinoline, or "pull-backs," it matters little; and Antony's 
words to Cleopatra,</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Egypt, thou knew'st too well<br/>

My heart was to thy rudder tied by strings,<br/>

And thou shouldst tow me after,"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>is as applicable in the nineteenth century and the centennial 
year of American independence, as it was when 
the great captain bent his "goodly eyes upon a tawny 
front."</p>

<p>"Dr. Maribel," continued Mrs. Wilbraham, as they 
stood talking in the drawing-room after breakfast, "I hear 
that you have a charming prot&eacute;g&eacute;e. Will I be indiscreet 
in asking you to afford me the pleasure of seeing her?"</p>

<p>A sigh scarcely audible, but so drawn out as to convey 
the idea that this frail, interesting creature was pining 
herself to death in the lonely grandeur of Worleigh, was 
the prelude to an appeal which was dangerous, because she 
was not counterfeiting&mdash;a real, strong feeling led her to 

<!-- page 92 -->

look so earnestly at John Maribel, and to throw into her 
tone and manner the languor and enticing softness of 
entreaty.</p>

<p>"You see that I am not strong," she said. "I would 
really be better&mdash;I am sure I would&mdash;for the variety 
which a pure, young mind&mdash;a fresh, bright nature, would 
afford me"</p>

<p>Now this sort of thing was peculiarly trying to John 
Maribel. Like most thoroughly honest people, the ugly 
fiend, suspicion, seldom interposed its hateful caution in 
the conclusions at which he arrived; and a simulation of 
feeling which responded to his own was accepted without 
question, proving&mdash;not surely his wisdom&mdash;but a charming 
faith in human nature, which involves some excellent 
qualities of heart, but too often proves a damaging investment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilbraham's words were poured forth so fluently 
and graciously, her eyes grew so tender and beseeching, 
that John Maribel was shorn of his opposition as completely
and submissively as is that much abused, but biblically 
honored animal, the sheep, when the snapping shears 
robs it of its wool. She followed him to the door, her 
soft muslin draperies flowing around her; her graceful, 
winning manner creating in John's mind a pleasurable 
impression, which the peculiar sweetness of her voice
served to deepen.</p>

<p>"May I count upon your acquiescence, Dr. Maribel?"</p>

<!-- page 93 -->

<p>"You surely may depend upon <i>me</i>, madam," he replied. 
"I cannot, however, answer for Miss Pitkin. She is apt 
to be a little obstinate where Mr. Pitkin is concerned; 
and no pleasure would entice her from the old man, should 
his ailments or his caprice require her presence."</p>

<p>"Good heavens! is he a Tithonus?" exclaimed Agatha.</p>

<p>"Could you see him," answered John, laughing, "you 
would scarce, even with the aid of a brilliant imagination, 
connect this tall, ungainly old hypochondriac with the 
glorious beauty that asked for immortality."</p>

<p>"How can you leave the young creature to such influences? 
Oh! Dr. Maribel, are you not responsible for 
this?"</p>

<p>He was startled at her earnestness into forgetting to 
question her right thus to speak to him. The justice of 
the reproach conveyed in Mrs. Wilbraham's words was 
keenly realized.</p>

<p>"When," he answered, "a man has carried a homeless 
child in his arms for twenty miles, on a stormy night, he 
may be pardoned, I think, for having turned with instinctive 
readiness to the first warm, bright suggestions 
which presented themselves to his mind. Infancy needs 
the sunshine of love&mdash;the indulgence of gentle hearts and 
an easy forgiveness for its innocent shortcomings. I knew 
that I ought not to take her to my own home; indeed, I 
don't know that I even thought for a moment of so doing.
My mind, from the commencement of our journey, was 

<!-- page 94 -->

occupied in solving the question as to the disposal of my
charge, in order to secure for her what I considered absolutely 
indispensable for a child of her tender years. I 
fixed upon Mrs. Pitkin as fulfilling, in a higher degree 
than any one whom I knew, my idea of a kind and 
motherly nature; and then the inclemency of the night 
urged a rapid decision. It is different to-day; but the 
mistakes of youth cannot always be remedied by the experience 
of mature years. We go through life with the 
consciousness of laboring under the disadvantageous consequences 
of repeated mistakes. I acknowledge that, in 
the case of Miss Pitkin, I have committed a very serious
one. Her strong sense of duty to the old man is proof
against any extraneous influence which may be brought to 
bear upon it; and I believe I too truly admire her dutiful 
adherence to the faith of her childhood to be willing 
to see it less truly loyal than it is. She sees old Pitkin 
through the halo of her sweet, grateful affection, and I 
scarcely think that I have a right to take away from her 
the innocent, I would say angelic, satisfaction of rendering
back to the old man what she received so unstintingly 
from his excellent wife."</p>

<p>John Maribel had been led on to say so much by Mrs. 
Wilbraham's encouragement of look and manner, and 
when he ceased speaking, his face flushed crimson with 
the consciousness of having, in what he had said, been 
guilty of an attempt at justification.</p>

<!-- page 95 -->

<p>"I cannot see things as you do, Dr. Maribel," answered 
Agatha, whose pallor struck him as being alarmingly suggestive 
of complete physical exhaustion. "A young life 
sacrificing itself is poetically very beautiful, practically 
very bad. Your prot&eacute;g&eacute;e is sacrificing the first, best joys 
of her budding life; they come but once, and die out 
quick enough. Forgive me," she added, recovering her
self-possession, "I am foolishly in earnest when I ride a 
hobby; and ever since I have heard of Miss Pitkin and 
her romantic history I have felt an absorbing desire to see 
her. Will you not bring her to me? You will come 
again to see my poor Babet&mdash;pray let it be this very week. 
I shall not feel easy until I see her quite restored; she is
sadly nervous."</p>

<p>John Maribel reflected for a moment. He know that 
Babet's sufferings were purely of the imagination; and 
imaginary ills were not strictly within the range of his 
science. The vivisection of honesty is a subtle process; 
difficult, because its standard varies according to the constitution 
of our moral nature. Its various modifications 
would be a curious study. Now John Maribel, essentially 
upright as he was, fell naturally into the very common 
deceit of humoring a woman's foibles and unblushingly 
profiting by their indulgence. It is legitimate grist that 
comes to the mill of professional privilege.</p>

<p>The reflections of John Maribel, as he drove back to 
town, were embittered by a sense of dissatisfaction with 

<!-- page 96 -->

himself, more pronounced than that feeling was apt to be 
with him, as he realized that he was actually irritated 
against Mr. Pitkin for holding on so obstinately to the 
tenure of his crabbed life, thus rendering Kitty's release a 
matter of indefinite probability. As he drew up his horse 
before the office door he was somewhat startled to find 
Jope there, dressed with an unusual attempt at "style," 
and wearing his hat with a jaunty, devil-may-care air that 
manifested a very strong and determined intention to appear 
in an entirely new character, which was so out of 
keeping with his usually slovenly, not to say dirty, attire, 
that John Maribel laughed outright as the boy took off 
his hat to him.</p>

<p>"What on earth, Jope, have you been doing to yourself?" 
he said, looking at the boy from head to foot.</p>

<p>"Please to let me go in, sir, along of you, and I'll tell 
you what's up; only I hope you don't think as there's 
anything out of the way with me?"</p>

<p>John Maribel at once sobered his face, and bade Jope 
follow him.</p>

<!-- page 97 -->

<div class="center" id="ch14">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p class="small">"I SCORN THAT WITH MY HEELS."</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Well,</span> Jope," said John Maribel, seating himself 
and passing his fingers through his hair, "has 
Mr. Pitkin raised your wages and given you a 
holiday?"</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> raise my wages! he would sooner scrape the flesh 
from my bones and sell 'em for a skeleton; and as to holiday, 
I get only the fag end of Sunday, and a double dose 
of chaff for it on Monday. I tell you what, Doctor, a man's 
got to assert hisself some time, and if he don't know when 
he's got rights, he takes it kind of somebody to tell him.
Now, the imposin' that I've stood; the suspection of things 
as I'd scorn to be guilty of; the being obliged to stand by 
and see the nutmegs counted, and to be patted about the 
chest every night, as if he was examining of me for the 
consumption, when he's only a feeling for cut sugar that he 
thinks I've got hid away under my coat. Oh! I've stood
it all and had it piled on and on to me, and didn't say as 
I'd like to choke him, because of Miss Kitty; and I'd be 
thankful to let her walk over me, only she's that sweet and 
good, that she'd sooner die than to put upon anybody.
Well, sir, I've been turnin' things around in my mind this 

<!-- page 98 -->

good while. It's my opinion that every man's got something 
as he can fall back upon, or he ought to have; and 
if my head's empty for want of learning, and gets buzzing 
around with ole Pitkin's jaw, well, my feet they makes up, 
in a manner, for it, and&mdash;I've&mdash;concluded&mdash;sir, to go in 
the song and dance business!"</p>

<p>This climax brought John Maribel up to the height of 
astonishment. He stood looking at Jope as if trying to 
identify him. His preconceived ideas of the grocer-boy 
were so completely subverted by the earnest, if ungrammatical, 
recital of his wrongs, and by his bold determination 
to redress them. Jope had struck upon a chord of sympathy 
which vibrated clearly and strongly. The ridiculous
figure no longer excited a desire to laugh in John Maribel.
Jope was doing what every soul is urged by its highest impulses 
to do&mdash;struggling to free himself from a tyrannical 
yoke, while the motive which had led him so long to submit 
to it was as purely chivalrous as that which gave 
themes to the Proven&ccedil;al poets, to be sung by the wandering 
troubadours. The little sweetness which the boy had 
tasted during his hard childhood had come to him through 
Kitty's smiles and pleasant words.</p>

<p>John Maribel, while he entered earnestly into Jope's 
troubles, was gravely in doubt how to advise him; his 
figure was certainly little suggestive of that "graceful, grotesque, 
and artistic motion" described on the play-bills;
nor could he by the utmost stretch of imagination conceive 

<!-- page 99 -->

of "Love among the Roses" coming from Jope's lips.
Talent has been seen, however, under the most unpromising 
of exteriors, and John Maribel was the last one to say 
words of discouragement to this would-be artist, or, in fact, 
to any one who manifested an earnest purpose in an undertaking. 
With him kindness was something more than easy
acquiescence, which is mischievous in proportion as the 
interest involved by the one who asks argues a complete
faith in the power to bestow, and when that faith is shaken 
it lowers the standard of human virtue and acts adversely, 
especially upon the young. John Maribel reflected that 
grace had little part in the exhibitions of minstrelsy, and 
that ludicrous contortions were remarkably mirth-creating; 
but he was little prepared to see a practical display of Jope's 
talents.</p>

<p>His coat was placed on a chair, his hat on the top of 
it; he drew in the buckle of his pants, passed a dingy 
handkerchief over his face, threw himself into position, 
and sang "Betsey Bumble Bee." Surprise followed upon 
surprise, for at the end of the first verse Jope stepped 
out, and, with a hitch in his gait and a peculiar swing of 
the body, walked around the table which occupied the centre 
of the room. Having twice made the circle he paused 
for an instant, and then with a spasmodic jerk and an 
alarming forward motion, as though he intended an assault 
upon Dr. Maribel, he suddenly righted himself, let fly his 
heels, and came down upon his toes until the old carpet 

<!-- page 100 -->

sent out such clouds of dust that performer and spectators 
were well-nigh suffocated.</p>

<p>A crowd had collected about the door of the office, 
attracted by the sound of laughter and the thumping of 
feet, while shouts of "Good for you, Jope! Well done, 
old fellow!" strongly indicated that his laughable antics 
were in keeping with the spirit of the times, and that the 
applause of the <i>impromptu</i> audience might be an earnest 
of future triumphs in his chosen profession. Encouraged 
by applause&mdash;and who is not?&mdash;poor Jope redoubled 
his efforts until, with crimson face and dripping 
from every pore, he was fain to give out from want of 
breath. When he had recovered himself sufficiently to 
articulate his words, and feeling a degree of self-satisfaction, 
which is the natural result of triumph, he said:</p>

<p>"Now, Doctor, what do <i>you</i> think of it?"</p>

<p>Before Dr. Maribel could reply, there was a diversion 
at the door; and Kitty appeared, her cheeks glowing, and 
something very like indignation in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jope! you ungrateful boy; what a figure you cut! 
Poor, foolish, nonsensical fellow, I am heartily ashamed 
of you!"</p> 

<p>"Please, Miss Kitty," answered the now crest-fallen 
song and dance man, "it was all along of the tappings 
and the nutmegs. A man's chest is his own; nobody's 
got a right to be thumping of it, as nightly it's done."</p>

<p>"Yes, you poor, foolish boy!" cried Kitty. "What 

<!-- page 101 -->

are grandfather's little disagreeable ways compared to your 
duty? I must say that I hardly expected that you would 
have left all the trouble of the shop on my hands."</p>

<p>There was a choking sound, a gulp, and the embryo 
artist ignominiously succumbed to Kitty's reproaches, and 
literally blubbered.</p>

<p>John Maribel had considerately dismissed the audience, 
and closed the door, so that the distressing capitulation 
was made without witnesses. He soothed Kitty in his 
own gentle way, assuring her that there was much to be 
said in favor of the culprit; finally obtaining clemency for 
him, and a promised restoration to her good opinion.</p>

<p>In the meantime Jope had resumed his coat; the crimson 
cravat had been thrust in the pocket, and his drooping 
and disconsolate look appealed so earnestly to Kitty's 
compassionate heart, that, with a half tender manner, she 
bade him go back to the shop, and never, never again 
grieve her so terribly.</p>

<p>Jope paused at the door, rattling the knob in a nervous 
way, and said: "It's all along of <i>you</i>, Miss Kitty, that I 
goes back. If I ever takes to the 'song and dance,' it 
will be the nutmegs and the thumpings as 'll do it."</p>

<p>Kitty's emotion resolved itself in a flood of tears, when, 
from the window, she saw Jope, with his hat drawn over 
his eyes, and his uncouth figure, slouching along with slow, 
uncertain steps. His ambition quelched, his ardor gone, 
he was turning back to his bondage. Poor boy! the tears 

<!-- page 102 -->

scarcely dried on his cheeks&mdash;his heart still swelling with 
disappointment and defeat, and yet, in the stimulus given 
to his better feeling, by his unselfish devotion to Kitty, 
there was a germ of progress which is possible even to the
humblest mind. Much that is deleterious to the heart and 
fatal to morals is gathered in the unwholesome freedom of 
the streets, and the noxious atmosphere of those brilliantly 
lighted halls, whence come, through the latticed doors, 
sounds of revelry and music, that draw with shrewdly-calculated 
<i>attractions</i>, and poison the germs of virtue in
the young, as surely as the canker in the heart of the 
peach robs it of its bloom, and withers it prematurely; 
but whenever a boy is so fortunate as to be under the influence 
of a pure and innocent love&mdash;whenever in his 
innermost heart he has raised a shrine, whether it be to 
some fancied ideal, or to a girl whom he watches on her 
way to school, and adores secretly&mdash;that boy is hemmed 
about with safeguards, and is not apt to fall into serious 
mischief.</p>

<p>It is far easier to go forward than to go back. In the 
one instance hope beckons with smiles, and whispers her 
honey-tongued <i>lusinghe</i>. In the other discouragement 
clogs the weary steps, and hampers the energies of the 
mind. In the revulsion of feeling caused by Kitty's 
unlooked-for appearance Jope was only painfully conscious 
of a deep sense of mortification and a dread of 
old Pitkin. Better impulses, though unsuspected by him, 

<!-- page 103 -->

were actively at work, and urged him to go on each time 
that his flagging courage prompted him to commit some 
act of desperation, rather than to give himself over to his 
persecutor. He reached the corner&mdash;a few steps more 
would bring him to the shop. He could see the window, 
just as he had arranged it the day before. He counted the 
mustard boxes, piled in pyramidal shape&mdash;the bottles of <i>parfait amour</i>, 
cura&ccedil;ao, and anisette that lay so temptingly side 
by side&mdash;the olives, and pickles, and sardines. Oh! he had 
polished them off yesterday, and given an extra touch to 
the plate-glass window, just because he thought it would be 
for the last time; yet here he was again, coming back voluntarily, 
to deliver himself up. His hand went instinctively 
into his pocket&mdash;not a picayune. He had put his 
savings into his outfit; and there was the red cravat 
crumpled up in that pocket. Oh! oh! oh! But a gentle 
touch fell upon his arm&mdash;a sweet smiling face looked into 
his&mdash;an angel voice spoke to him.</p>

<p>"Poor Jope! I know how hard it is; but you are 
doing what is right. You are a good, brave boy; I will 
always be your friend, dear Jope."</p>

<p>The face grew bright, the drooping figure was reanimated 
into fresh life; he could have faced the whole world 
unflinchingly, and snapped his fingers at fate. He walked 
unhesitatingly into the shop. Kitty was by his side. 
What had he to fear?</p>

<p>"You young rascal! so you have taken to running 

<!-- page 104 -->

away," cried Mr. Pitkin, as his eye fell upon the culprit.</p> 

<p>"Now, the most selfish person we over met," says Leigh
Hunt, "was upwards of a hundred, and had the glorious
reputation of not being movable by anything or anybody." 
This old man was but a type of many other old men and 
women; and I am afraid that Mr. Pitkin belonged to the 
class. To him, Jope was Jope; an ugly appendage to his 
grocery&mdash;a pair of hands, a pair of eyes, a pair of feet, all 
exercised for a small stipend, paid grudgingly, but regularly, 
out of which just as much value received as could 
be extorted was taken in the way of night-work.</p>

<p>"Grandfather!" exclaimed Kitty reproachfully, "is 
this the way you keep your promise? Remember that 
you were to let things go just the same if I brought Jope 
back to you."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I've come along with Miss Kitty, sir; and I 
never would but for her. I've served you faithful, Mr. 
Pitkin, and you've paid me for it by suspection and
nightly searchings as would be fit only for a thief. Now, 
sir, I've come back; but won't be put upon. Whenever 
you drive me to desperation, I've got my feet to fall 
upon."</p>

<p>"What does the idiot say, Kitty?" cried the thoroughly 
exasperated old man, "What does he mean by 
throwing up his feet in my face?"</p>

"Only, grandfather, that he has been very foolish, and 

<!-- page 105 -->

thought of joining a minstrel company. Pray, don't be 
too hard on him."</p>

<p>Mr. Pitkin was speechless; his jaw fell; his head protruded 
until his skinny neck was elongated like a turtle's, 
as he adjusted his spectacles, the better to view the monster; 
then, with cutting irony, he said, slowly emphasizing 
his words:</p>

<p>"So we have an artist among us!"</p>

<p>Kitty's hand was again on Jope's arm. "Don't mind, 
poor fellow! It will be all the better for you, if you don't 
mind now."</p>

<p>"I'll try, Miss Kitty," he answered in a disconsolate 
tone; "but it's all along of you, I'll try."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>

<p class="small">"GIFTS THAT GOD GIVES."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Good</span> intentions are but too frequently abortive 
attempts of our higher instinct to assert its supremacy 
over the vacillating incompleteness of 
frail humanity, and failing, as we often do fail, in carrying 
them out, does but retard our progress toward the perfection

<!-- page 106 -->

to which we all naturally aspire. Were our actions 
always prompted by these first outbursts of our better, 
purer nature, how different would be the sum of our account 
with God!</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrott had just heard from John Maribel the 
details of his visit to Worleigh. A sharp pain pierced 
her heart when he expatiated with honest admiration upon 
Agatha's winning manners, her charming cordiality, and 
her sweet interest in his darling.</p>

<p>"I am going up on Thursday, aunt, and Kitty has 
promised to go with me. Don't you think that she will 
be equal to the occasion? She carries herself like a princess. 
Many a royal lady might be glad of her beauty."</p>

<p>"If we only knew what is best for her, John," answered 
Mrs. Parrott.</p>

<p>She would not break her faith with Agatha, yet she 
yearned to save the girl. In the conflict which was 
raging in her breast, the cry of duty grew loud over the 
contending passion of her love for Agatha. Now, as ever 
before, she yielded to the dictates of that love. Her intentions 
were good; but these are a frail barrier only 
against the encroachment of influences strong in proportion 
as they act upon a nature biased by a ruling and absorbing 
passion.</p>

<p>John Maribel, unconscious of the struggle that was 
going on in Mrs. Parrott's mind, continued to talk to her 
concerning Kitty's proposed visit, and ended by asking 

<!-- page 107 -->

her to give her some hints about her toilette, and to send
Nellie off at once for her, in order that they might consult 
together on so important a subject.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrott deferred to all that John required of her, 
but with the same hard manner which had characterized 
her since her sojourn in his house. An hour later, Kitty 
came tripping in, sweet as</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Elaine the fair, Elaine the lovable;<br/>

Elaine, the lily maid of Astolat."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>She was in high spirits, eager to view this unknown 
world, which to her young imagination was so full of 
moving, living beauty&mdash;so bright with enchanting women 
heroic men. Kitty was, as all pretty girls are, and 
should be, appreciative of her good looks, and fully aware 
of their value. She had never looked upon a glowing 
Titian, or the bright splendor of a Guido; she knew nothing 
of the ideal glories of the old Greeks; the fact is, she 
had as yet seen no beauty more perfect than her own.
Her mirror showed her each day an image, fresh from the 
hands of God, delicate with the flesh-tints of youth and 
health, luxuriant with a wealth of life, and animated with 
a pure soul that looked out from the depths of her soft, 
tender eyes. What woman is so dull to the inspiration of 
the Beautiful as not to recognize it in herself when thus 
presented to her view? Mrs. Parrott looked at her as she 

<!-- page 108 -->

stood tossing up a rose, which she dexterously caught in 
her hand. The old lady had spent much of her life among 
the wonders of Italian art; and she watched this pretty 
study, seizing at once the artistic grace of the light, springing 
movements.</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten, Kitty, the important business 
before us? Have you forgotten that you are to go to 
Worleigh the day after to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, Aunt Parrott; I have thought of nothing 
else since it was decided that I should accept Mrs. Wilbraham's 
invitation."</p>

<p>"Well, then, my dear, have you fixed upon your toilette?"</p>

<p>"I shall wear my white muslin," answered Kitty. "It 
is beautiful, aunt; not one of those stiff things, but soft 
and sheer, just like a floating cloud; and I have bought a 
lovely sash and a ribbon for my hair. What more do I 
want?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, my dear, except a bit of advice. A ride of 
ten miles in a buggy will not benefit a dress that looks 
like a cloud. You are to spend the whole day at Worleigh, 
and you will naturally want to look your best at 
dinner. Take your white muslin with you, and wear a
lawn for the drive."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Kitty, "that will do admirably. I 
was quite unhappy last night when I thought of my crumpled 
dress; for of course, after a ten miles' ride in John's 

<!-- page 109 -->

buggy, it could not be otherwise. Now my mind is quite 
free to enjoy myself!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrott rang her bell, and with a promptness as 
marvellous as that with which the slave of the lamp appeared 
to Aladdin, Nellie answered the summons. If she did not 
rise out of the floor, she came from the next nearest place, 
and that was from behind Mrs. Parrott's bedroom door.</p>

<p>"Nellie," said the old lady, "if I were not positively 
sure that you are not a subject of especial grace, and 
therefore not an organ for miraculous manifestation, I
should say that your appearance was remarkable, if you 
were not listening from behind the door."</p> 

<p>"And would I be listening, because I was behind the 
door? Couldn't you have left your hood on the verandah, 
and couldn't I be hanging it up on the peg?"</p>

<p>Kitty gave a clear, silvery laugh&mdash;a laugh that was not 
the least of her charming gifts.</p>

<p>"Oh, Nellie!" she said, "I am sure that Aunt Parrott 
is quite satisfied that curiosity has had nothing at all to do 
with your being behind the door."</p>

<p>"You are always carrying things off in that way, Miss 
Kitty," answered Nellie, with an accusing blush; "and I 
must say that I think it a mighty pleasant way."</p>

<p>"And I must say that age grants you neither wisdom 
nor good manners, Nellie Shea," said Mrs. Parrott. "Go 
to the third drawer of my bureau and bring me the inlaid 
box which you will find there."</p>

<!-- page 110 -->

<p>The box was brought; Mrs. Parrott opened it with a 
small silver key which hung on her bunch, and drew forth 
a bit of lace, rich with age, and exquisite of texture.</p>

<p>"Kitty," she said, "this is for you&mdash;a fragment only 
of what I once possessed, and if I have not parted with it 
before, it is because souvenirs, dear to my heart, cluster 
around it. It could not meet a happier destiny, my dear, 
than to shadow with its delicate arabesque pattern your 
round white throat."</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear Aunt Parrott," exclaimed Kitty, 
examining the lace which she had taken in her hand; 
"it is indeed very beautiful, but, I fear, far too valuable 
for my wearing."</p>

<p>"Vulgar eyes, my dear, would not esteem its value, or 
even suspect it. Accept it for the sake of that past which 
is mysteriously connected with the present&mdash;out of which 
memories come fresh and vivid when much else of the 
days that were has passed from my mind."</p>

<p>"I believe," answered Kitty, "that this lace has a story 
attached to it. Am I not right, dear Aunt Parrott, and 
am I taking too great a liberty in asking you to tell it to 
me?"</p>

<p>"It is quite natural that my words should have aroused 
your curiosity, and I am perfectly willing to tell you the 
story&mdash;for there is one; but I warn you that it is a sad 
one."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>

<p class="small">"SHALL I TELL YOU WHY?"</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Long</span> years ago, Kitty&mdash;years that seem like a 
dream to me now, so far are they separated 
from my life of to-day&mdash;I was a bride, young, 
attractive&mdash;can you believe it?&mdash;and, as I thought, beloved. 
We were in Venice, my husband and I&mdash;in that 
beautiful city of the sea, noted for its gay life&mdash;its marvels 
of art, still living in the senators of Tintoretto, in the 
knights of Giorgione, and the sumptuous beauties of Titian, 
who counted no tissues too precious, no jewels too costly, 
to relieve, not enhance, their charms. The Dorias and the 
Sforzas fostered with princely rewards the artists who 
created objects which simply conduced to their pleasure. 
Among the most beautiful of the arts thus encouraged was 
that of lace-making. The most superb tracings were used 
in the designs. They were copied from the Gothic, 
Saracenic, and Renaissance&mdash;exquisite wreaths and vases 
and scrolls of <i>cinque cento</i>, all wrought out with wonderful 
skill. These costly relies of a past age are treasured in 
the old families as priceless heirlooms.</p> 

<p>"I had been but a few weeks the occupant of one of the 
old palaces where everything breathed of a past, rich 

<!-- page 112 -->

with pomp and splendor&mdash;great with the wealth of its 
merchant princes and the glory of its men of genius. 
Sadly inharmonious with that marvellous past was the
quiet city, laved by the Adriatic waves, moaning the dirge
of its slow decay. I was standing on a balcony overlooking 
the water, watching the gondolas glide by, and wishing
for the return of my husband, when I saw a woman stepping 
from one at the foot of the stairs. She sprang lightly 
up the marble stops, and before I could recover from my 
surprise she was at my side.</p>

<p>" 'Signora, come with me, I entreat you!'</p>

<p>"The thrilling tone of agony in her voice, the earnest, 
imploring eyes, brought to my heart a conviction of urgent 
need for succor; and notwithstanding the imprudence of 
the step, I determined to go with her. I caught up a 
light scarf, threw it over my head, and followed her rapid 
footsteps.</p>

<p>"It was only after we were seated in the gondola that I 
observed that one of her hands was wrapped in her 
mantle, and, to my horror, I saw that it was stained with 
blood. The gathering twilight scarcely permitted me to 
discern her features; but I guessed that she was young; 
for there was about her the outward expression of emotion 
which belongs to those yet untried by grief. The impatience 
of youth manifested itself in her frantic entreaties 
to the gondolier to make greater speed. Any connected 
speech seemed impossible to her, and I was relieved when 

<!-- page 113 -->

the gondola touched ground. We entered the portal of a 
great, gloomy building, and as I followed her down a vast 
stone corridor, I became thoroughly frightened, and bitterly 
regretted having engaged in so wild an adventure.
We entered a low room, which seemed to be a sort of 
ante-chamber leading to a larger apartment.</p>

<p>" 'Come, come, Signora,' she whispered, 'You will 
not find <i>him</i> here.'</p>

<p>"A wild terror seized upon me. I caught her hand&mdash;alas! 
the bleeding hand; for she had thrown off her 
mantle&mdash;and a suppressed groan burst from her lips as 
the blood gushed forth afresh.</p>

<p>" 'Ah! forgive me,' I cried, 'I have hurt you.'</p>

<p>"She had already torn a strip from her dress and was 
binding it around her hand. In all this she displayed a 
courage which at any other time would have won my 
sincere admiration. Then I thought only of my own peril; 
but the woman was holding aside the curtain which fell 
before the door, and by an irresistible impulse I obeyed 
the sign which she made me to enter the room.</p>

<p>" '<i>Santa Maria!</i>' she murmured, as she glided past 
me, and in an instant she was on her knees beside a low 
bed, on which an infant lay, tossing and moaning in the 
heat of fever. She kissed the flushed brow, the hot,
parched lips, and then the little, thin hands, again and 
again, with passionate tenderness, pouring out words of 
endearment, which met with no response from the little 

<!-- page 114 -->

sufferer&mdash;not even a look of recognition in the dark eyes, 
which seemed unnaturally large from the excessive 
emaciation of the face.</p>

<p>"A lamp hung from the ceiling, shedding a dim light 
over this harrowing scene; and as I comprehended this 
woman's need, I thought less of myself, and began to realize 
the necessity of immediate action. My first impulse 
was to get a physician. The gondolier was still there, for 
I had told him to wait for me; but as I moved toward the 
door in order to execute my purpose, the afflicted woman 
sprang to her feet and barred my passage.</p>

<p>" 'Merciful lady,' she cried, 'succor my child. I am 
starving&mdash;do you not see it?' and she held her ghastly, 
attenuated face close to mine, 'I am dying; I can no 
longer beg for her. Oh! I saw you give to blind Bianca 
in the market-place. I followed you, that I might know 
where to find you. Oh! gracious lady, take pity on my 
child!'</p>

<p>" 'Let me go,' I said; 'I will send for a physician.
There is no time to be lost.'</p>

<p>"I flew to the gondolier, and despatched him at once for 
a physician, giving him, at the same time, money to buy 
food and wine. Returning to the room, I found the woman 
prostrate beside the child. She had made her last 
effort, expended her last strength in asking charity for 
her. While I chafed her cold hands, I prayed as I had 
never prayed before. There are times in all of our lives 

<!-- page 115 -->

when we place ourselves directly at the footstool of God, 
and realize His sympathy with our needs. Faith is 
created in the human heart by a sense of human weakness;
and at that moment, utterly thrown upon myself, I
comprehended, as I fear I have never since done, the comfort 
of God's presence.</p>

<p>"I spoke Italian just sufficiently to make myself understood; 
so I implored her to take courage, and to tell me 
in what way I could best help her.</p>

<p>" 'Signora,' she answered, in tones scarce audible, 'I 
loved Angelo. For his sake I abandoned my father's 
house; and see!' she cried, raising her voice as she uncovered 
her wounded hand, 'he would have murdered me
to-night. Ah! Signora, save my child!'</p>

<p>"With a horror which I cannot express I saw that she 
had exhausted her last strength. The ghastly features 
sharpened; the large eyes lost their light, and when a few 
moments later the physician came, there was but one who 
needed his care. The woman was dead.</p>

<p>"I took the child home with me. She was a mere infant. 
I carried her in my arms, and as I held her pressed 
to my bosom, something which I could not understand&mdash;a 
yearning which has never been satisfied, made me tenderly
anxious for her; and from that moment I loved her as
well as a woman can love a child which is not her own. 
When I undressed her, I found that bit of lace tucked 
away under her dress. A mother's love had placed it 

<!-- page 116 -->

there, and I divined the precaution which had prompted 
her to secrete it upon the child's person."</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrott paused, while Kitty sat with an expression 
of expectancy on her face; but the old lady was silent; 
she had finished her story.</p>

<p>"Not now, not now, my dear," she answered to Kitty's 
entreaty that she would go on. "I have told you the 
story of the lace."</p>

<p>There was something in Mrs. Parrott's tone which 
checked importunity in Kitty, for one of her nicest traits
was her delicate tact. Tact is repellant of intrusive curiosity, 
as it is of other offensive failings, against which 
it is a better safeguard than even the highest degree of 
culture; for cultivation may exist without it, and it is 
just so much the less available for the absence of this 
quality.</p> 

<p>Kitty, as she walked homeward, was thinking of Mrs. 
Parrott's strange, sad story, and wondering whether she 
would ever hear the sequel, when she became aware of 
footsteps directly behind her. She slackened her pace, 
hoping that they would outstrip her own; but no; they 
were, on the contrary, measured by them. Remembering 
John Maribel's warning, she became uncomfortable and 
nervous. The tall magnolia trees grow thickly just there,
shadowing the road into gloom. The footsteps followed 
always, quicker or slower, as she slackened or increased her 
pace. At last, the suspense growing unbearable, she 

<!-- page 117 -->

turned abruptly, and found herself face to face with her 
unwelcome companion. He took off his hat to her with 
an air which at once set at rest her fears as to the safety 
of her purse and jewelry. No one could look less 
highwayman than did this mild-mannered personage in 
his shabby dress, which, however, failed to cover the fact 
of his being a gentleman.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," he said, "I know that I have been guilty 
of a rudeness; but while I watched your graceful movements, 
I had no desire to speak to you, and yet I wished 
to inquire from you whether Dr. Maribel lives in this 
neighborhood."</p>

<p>"You have left his house behind you," answered Kitty 
"the white cottage&mdash;his name is on the gate."</p>

<p>"Thank you," he answered absently, looking at Kitty 
in the meantime, and so earnestly that she colored under 
his glance and turned to continue on her way. "One
moment," he urged; "I have heard that Dr. Maribel is 
charitable. Would he, think you, succor an unfortunate 
man?"</p>

<p>"His unfailing charity has retarded his fortune," she 
answered, "for he is far from being a rich man. Pray, 
accept this; I can well spare it, and you may not find 
Dr. Maribel at home."</p>

<p>The stranger drew back with a motion of haughty surprise. 
"You mistake me," he said; "the greatest charity 
is that which brings relief to a wounded heart: I had 

<!-- page 118 -->

reference to none other. Put back your purse, dear young 
lady; I am almost sorry that I cannot accept what you so 
graciously offer. Pardon me; but you speak warmly of 
Dr. Maribel. You know him, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Know John Maribel!" exclaimed Kitty; "why, he 
is the dearest friend I have on earth!" A sudden 
brightening of the eye&mdash;a look which passed over her with 
eager scrutiny&mdash;betrayed an awakened interest in herself, 
and the impropriety of having entered into conversation 
with this stranger at once presented itself to her 
thought. With heightened color, she was turning from 
him, when he laid a detaining hand upon her arm.</p>

<p>"Pardon me once more," he said; "I would ask you 
one more question. Are you Catherine Featherstone?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Kitty, a possibility flashing through 
her mind, to which the changed, excited looks of the man 
seemed to give reason; "no; I am Kitty Pitkin, and I
beg that you permit me to proceed on my way."</p>

<p>The stranger bowed dejectedly, saying: "A likeness 
may sometimes deceive."</p>

<p>Kitty turned once to look after him. He was slowly 
retracing his steps.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVII.</p>

<p class="small">"I SAW SWEET BEAUTY IN HER FACE."</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear</span> John," said Kitty, as they sat talking in the 
little parlor behind the shop, "I want to tell 
you of my adventure."</p>

<p>"Your adventure, Kitty! Ah, you have been walking 
alone again; you have forgotten my warning."</p>

<p>"Not another word will I say!" she cried, "while that 
ugly frown disfigures your brow."</p>

<p>He took her hand between his own, with that gentle, 
familiar caress to which Kitty had been so long accustomed. 
Her intercourse with John Maribel was so guilelessly 
innocent that, with the delicate sense of honor 
which guided all his actions, he took care that neither 
look nor manner should wake suspicion of the love for her 
which was daily growing stronger in his heart. He was 
far too generous to fetter her affections, and too fearful to 
risk the loss of the sweet, spontaneous devotion given to
him as freely as the violet yields its perfume. Love is
responsive to love. It leaps into life as Psyche was 
roused from her slumbers by the touch of Cupid's flower-tipped 

<!-- page 120 -->

arrow, and a woman's life but really begins at that 
awakening. She then grows and expands into the perfect 
organization of womanhood&mdash;the fit complement that God 
conceived when he saw that man needed a helpmate. For 
this was John Maribel waiting in hope.</p>

<p>He kept the dear hand within his own and smiled; thus 
smoothing the ugly wrinkles which furrowed his brow.</p>

<p>"If I promise to be perfectly amiable and forgiving to 
you, dear, do not require too much forbearance from me 
toward any one who has had the temerity to offend you," 
he said.</p>

<p>"You go too fast, John," answered Kitty. "An adventure 
is not necessarily unpleasant; I don't know but 
that I was more sorry for the poor man than frightened 
at his strange manner."</p>

<p>"Kitty, you are tantalizing! Some impudent fellow 
has accosted you."</p>

<p>"I was coming from your house, John&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Alone?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that I was, John. I have often walked 
home alone. It was broad daylight; and really, John, 
don't you think that I am old enough to take care of 
myself?"</p>

<p>"You are old enough to be charmingly attractive; and 
I forbid&mdash;do you heed, Kitty&mdash;I forbid you to go about 
bewitching people."</p>

<p>The words were lightly spoken, to cover a sense of real 

<!-- page 121 -->

uneasiness and annoyance. Kitty was not deceived by 
them, and answered quite gravely:</p>

<p>"I promise you, dear John, that never again will I expose 
myself to the risk of being accosted by a stranger; or 
even to the chance of being politely questioned as I was 
to-day."</p>

<p>"Some one has questioned you, Kitty?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he wished to know where you lived, and whether 
you were charitable, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Committed the daring incivility of stopping an unprotected 
lady to ask a physician's address!" exclaimed 
John Maribel, "when he might have found it out by looking 
in the directory. Pray, what pretext did he allege for 
detaining you, after you had answered his question?"</p>

<p>"A very natural one. He wanted to find out who the 
bewitching young creature was; and, with a directness 
which was rather startling, asked me whether I was 
Catherine Featherstone. He evidently mistook me for 
that young lady, whoever she may be."</p>

<p>John let fall Kitty's hand; he was so thoroughly astonished, 
that for a moment speech was impossible. There 
was a glance of rapid retrospection. His thoughts went 
back to the night, long years ago, when he had found, in 
the dim, cold, death-chamber of Ethan Featherstone the 
little child whom he carried through the storm to the Red 
Tavern. Then, as ever afterwards, he had followed the 
instincts of his generous heart without troubling himself 

<!-- page 122 -->

about the mystery with which old Featherstone had chosen 
to surround her. Indeed, he grew to love her so fondly, 
and to find how much of his peace and happiness were 
centred in his guardianship, that he dreaded any revelation 
which might endanger his intimate relations with her, or 
change her trusting dependence upon him. Her allowance 
had been regularly remitted, and as regularly placed 
in the savings bank. He had worked all the more courageously 
for the dear thought that Kitty was to be a sharer 
in its fruits&mdash;all the more nobly for following out the 
divine precept, "Let not thy left hand know what thy 
right hand doeth."</p>

<p>Kitty believed that grandfather Pitkin's affection for 
her had overcome his natural penuriousness, and for this 
reason her sweet gratitude was ever chastening the uprising 
of rebellious protests against the old man's selfish 
exactions. John Maribel was all the better satisfied that 
his share in her maintenance and education should remain 
unsuspected.</p>

<p>"John, dear John," cried Kitty, "what have I done?"</p>

<p>He recovered himself before answering, and then, taking 
her hand again, he said, soothingly:</p>

<p>"You cannot suppose that I blame you, dear; but I 
implore you, as you love me,"&mdash;his voice, in spite of his 
effort to maintain its usual tone, trembled with a new intonation&mdash;"to 
avoid in future the possibility of so unpleasant 
a <i>rencontre</i>. Villainy assumes many forms, and 

<!-- page 123 -->

the most insidious is often clothed in civil speech and insinuating 
manners."</p>

<p>"I cannot think, John," answered Kitty, "that the 
man's intentions were bad. Nothing in his person indicated 
vulgarity, and his manner, though somewhat excited, 
was neither obtrusive nor impertinent. I believe 
that he was bitterly disappointed at his mistake. He 
may be insane, poor man; and it was this idea which 
frightened me."</p>

<p>"Well," said John, rising, "I shall try to find out 
what the fellow wants. Don't think any more about him, 
Kitty. Remember that we go to Worleigh the day after 
to-morrow. You must carry your best looks thither. 
Good-night."</p>

<p>"John, I am sure that I have grieved you. Won't you 
kiss me, as you are used to do when you say good-night?"</p>

<p>He drew her to him for a moment; his lips lightly 
touched her brow; and, without a word, he turned and 
left the room.</p>

<p>Jope had been holding his horse; and, as John Maribel 
took the bridle out of his hand, the boy noticed his unusual 
pallor.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the Doctor's took bad," he said to himself, 
as he went into the shop.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVIII.</p>

<p class="small">"GOOD-MORROW, GENTLE MISTRESS: WHERE AWAY?"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fair young day was smiling on hill and vale
as John Maribel and Kitty emerged into the 
country, leaving behind them the town, sleeping 
in summer dulness. Oh! it was pleasant to travel 
the golden hours between banks of flowers, bright-hued 
and fresh with dew; to look far away to the purple hills, 
and, nearer, at the waving fields of corn; to hear the hum 
of the brown bees among the morning-glories and the 
song of the mocking-bird trilling out its mingled melody 
with exultant gladness. Kitty sat mute, allowing her soul 
its full communion with the sweetness of the summer 
morning.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"A crowd of hopes,<br/>

That sought to sow themselves like wing&egrave;d seeds<br/>

Born out of everything she heard and saw,<br/>

Fluttered about her senses and her soul;<br/>

And vague desires, like fitful blasts of balm,<br/>

To one that travels quickly, made the air<br/>

Of Life delicious."</p>

</blockquote>

She had seldom been in the country&mdash;only once or twice 
with Dr. Maribel, when she was a child. This was all 

<!-- page 125 -->

new to her, a moving panorama lighted by sunshine and 
glowing with life. John Maribel watched her silent joy 
with unspeakable delight; he saw but her; he felt that 
all the beauty of the summer day was but the harmony of 
sound and color, blending in exquisite touches with her 
loveliness. One hour like this is but a hint of that ecstatic 
enjoyment which we conceive through the faculty of imagination, 
with the aid of youth and hope. John Maribel 
had no such aids; for he was no longer a very young man, 
and any hallucination of the senses may seem out of keeping 
with the sobered judgment and experience of his ripe 
years; but his was one of those rare and beautiful natures 
which retain their capability of enjoyment, because they, 
perhaps, have failed to extract any very practical uses
from the stern school-dame Experience, but have rather 
fostered a confiding faith in the possibility of human happiness. 
This possibility John Maribel saw in a future 
made bright by Kitty's love. He was thinking of this 
now, as he looked at her with the soft sunlight falling 
upon her, and her face glowing with health and enjoyment.</p>

<p>She suddenly turned to him and smiled. Oh! such a 
smile flashing from eyes and mouth&mdash;parting the curved 
lips and showing the small, regular teeth.</p>

<p>"I believe that you are having a dull ride, John. I have 
scarcely spoken a word to you," she said.</p>

<p>"People can be very happy without talking, Kitty. 
You remember that Claudio says: 'Silence is the perfectest 

<!-- page 126 -->

herald of joy': I were but little happy, if I could 
say how much."</p>

<p>"I am glad to know that you have been enjoying yourself," 
she said, archly; "but I believe my silent mood is 
over. Shall I be interrupting your pleasant reverie by 
talking?"</p>

<p>"I believe it is quite time that it was interrupted, Kitty. 
It was growing too pleasant."</p>

<p>Just then a clear, shrill cry echoed through the forest;
and as they descended a hill into the lower ground, where
the pasturage was good, they espied a black urchin 
minding his calves.</p>

<p>"See them, John, scampering across the meadow. Oh! 
the pretty, dappled creatures," exclaimed Kitty.</p>

<p>The calves were, unfortunately, not the only objects of 
attention. Two women were approaching them, riding 
upon a dejected-looking mare, which seemed to be kept in 
an uncomfortable state of maternal solicitude by her 
youthful progeny, perseveringly bent upon getting what 
she could not conveniently give.</p>

<p>"John, John! they are going to stop," cried Kitty. 
"See, they are making signs to you."</p>

<p>It was only too true. Dr. Maribel had been recognized. 
There was no help for it. Old Mrs. Thom drew rein, 
threw back her sun-bonnet, and bade him "Good-morning."</p> 

<p>"Well, how's times with you, Doctor?"</p>

<!-- page 127 -->

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Thom," answered John Maribel, "I 
believe that I have nothing to complain of just at this 
moment."</p>

<p>"I reckon you hain't," she said, "riding along of as 
pretty a gal as I ever sot eyes on."</p>

<p>Kitty's scarlet cheeks must have enhanced her good 
looks; for the girl who hung on behind seemed absolutely 
petrified with admiration&mdash;so steadily did she gaze at her 
with her dilated blue eyes.</p>

<p>"I hope you are all well up in your neighborhood, Mrs. 
Thom," said John Maribel, hoping to divert her attention 
from Kitty.</p>

<p>"Only middling, Doctor. Fever's bin right sharp 
around, and Bill, he's down with ague; but father, he's 
mightily helped with them bitters you sent up. Since old 
Mr. Featherstone died, and its nigh on to eighteen years, 
you don't come much about Mapleton. The babies is all 
grown into likely gals and strapping young men. I s'pose
you don't remember Dick Peck? Well, he's gone off to 
Californy; and Mary Elizabeth Downs, she's got married; 
and old Mother Beckwith, she got a fall going to meeting, 
and I heard say as how the doctor couldn't do her much 
good."</p> 

<p>"Well, well," exclaimed John Maribel, knowing from 
past experience Mrs. Thom's prolixity in neighborhood 
gossip, "I'll promise to go to the first wedding; but you 
must excuse me now; I am anxious to get on."</p>

<!-- page 128 -->

<p>"I reckon you'll have wedding at home before long, 
if you hain't had one already; but I won't be a keeping 
of you. Good-day to you both."</p>

<p>"Oh, John!" exclaimed Kitty, tears of vexation 
trembling in her eyes.</p>

<p>"What is it, dear? Are you really so greatly annoyed 
at the admiration of these poor country people? Divest 
Mrs. Thom's language of its homeliness, and you have a
pretty, and, I am sure, a very sincere compliment. I 
mean about your being 'as pretty a gal as she ever sot
eyes on.' "</p>

<p>Kitty laughed, in spite of her annoyance.</p>

<p>"She is an odious old woman, John. I wonder that 
you should encourage her to talk."</p>

<p>"Such people," answered John Maribel, "have their 
aches and pains as well as their more opulent neighbors; 
and they are scrupulously honest about paying the 
doctor's fee."</p>

<p>"I really believed you incapable of courting the favor 
of old women for their money," laughed Kitty.</p>

<p>"Not altogether for that, dear; but I have never had 
the 'world as my confectionery,' therefore I have to look 
about me for my sweets; and will you believe me when I 
tell you that such people as Mrs. Thom sometimes furnish 
them?"</p>

<p>"I believe I don't quite understand you; but my irritation 
against her originated in the shock which she gave 

<!-- page 129 -->

to my enjoyment. The uncouth couple were so dreadfully 
out of keeping with this bright landscape, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kitty," said John Maribel, "unkindness would be 
much more out of keeping with your sweet nature. These 
homely people possess many sterling qualities which 
dignify them into respectability. In the relations of wife 
and mother, they stand pre-eminent. They are industrious, 
honest, and dutiful in their conjugal relations, while their 
devotion to their children renders the self-abnegation consequent 
upon the exigencies of poverty almost sublime.
'Beauty is the mark which God sets upon virtue,' and 
these uncouth, simple people are not devoid of it. Such 
women as Mrs. Thom, Kitty, give soldiers to their 
country's need."</p>

<p>"I feel really ashamed of myself, John; but to be frank 
with you, I would never have discovered that beauty, 
'which is the mark that God sets upon virtue,' without 
the aid of that moral insight which you seem to have. I 
believe that you have been endowed with the blessed gift 
of seeing with your moral sight, and this is so clear and 
just that you seek out treasures where other people only 
see vulgarity and ugliness. By the by, do you suppose 
that the old Mr. Featherstone, who died at Mapleton so 
many years ago, could have been in any way connected 
with the Catherine Featherstone for whom the mysterious 
stranger mistook me?"</p>

<p>John Maribel gave the horse a smart cut with the whip, 
 
<!-- page 130 -->

and, as the road was rough, this accelerated speed required 
that he should give undivided attention to his 
guidance. When proceeding at a more sober pace, he 
answered Kitty:</p>

<p>"Old Featherstone was a very rich man, dear. A close 
connection of his, in all probability, is a wealthy woman. 
I am speaking hypothetically, you understand. Do you 
think that she is to be envied because of her wealth?"</p>

<p>This question was the veriest platitude. No one knew 
better than did John Maribel that people were envied, 
and they always would be, for being richer than their 
neighbors. Yet he weakly yearned to hear Kitty say that 
she was indifferent to them. Riches would place so great 
a barrier between them.</p>

<p>"Were I rich, dear John," she replied, "you would 
never need to take money from poor Mrs. Thom."</p>

<p>This childlike reply brought its sweetness with it. In 
her thoughts she associated him with the generous impulses 
of her own truly noble nature. They were then 
entering the grounds of Worleigh. From out of the pure 
brightness of the past, childhood was waving her a last 
adieu; the portals of a new life were opening for her;
and, when the great gates shut with jangling clang behind 
them, a sudden revulsion brought to John Maribel for a 
moment a positive sense of danger. He was casting his 
lot with others, who might aspire to her love, and who, in 
all likelihood, might have a better chance to win it. He 

<!-- page 131 -->

long remembered this summer morning on which his love
gave to everything a new and tender significance&mdash;long 
remembered the swaying willow-branches which touched 
Kitty as she passed&mdash;the mellowed light under the 
arching trees&mdash;the waving grass&mdash;the moving breath of the 
perfumed air, and Kitty's hand resting so lovingly on his 
knee, as she leaned forward to get a better view of the 
grand, old house.</p>

<p>No lapse of time could ever obliterate the bright picture 
which was engraved on his heart, or dim the beauty of its 
coloring.</p>

<p>Kitty's face was beaming with delighted surprise as she 
exclaimed: "Dear John, how beautiful this is!"</p>

<p>It was a revelation of that other life which was dawning 
for them. Her eyes were turned away from him&mdash;he 
was adoring her.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>

<p class="small">"HER WONDROUS QUALITIES AND MILD BEHAVIOR."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Agatha Wilbraham's</span> style was unimpeachable, 
her manners graceful and easy, her 
conversation marked by the happiest graces of 
expression. Whether she dealt in the brilliant and sparkling 

<!-- page 132 -->

vivacity of the French, or the more rich and copious 
language of the Anglo-Saxon, she was equally felicitous, 
wielding to the best advantage the power given to but 
few&mdash;that of keeping up a constant interest in the minds 
of those whom she wished to propitiate. Her personal 
charms were on the wane. She was thin, and often pale 
and haggard from physical suffering; but the sparkling of 
her wit never failed, and the spell of her manner was perhaps 
increased by a certain languor which elicited sympathy. 
On this day&mdash;when Kitty was left entirely to her, 
when she could enjoy unrestrained the exquisite pleasure 
of her companionship, when she lavished upon her the 
tenderest caresses, and begrudged every moment that she
was not in her presence&mdash;on this day she tasted a joy 
that was all the more alluring, because it was dangerous.
She was intoxicated with the satisfaction of long yearning 
of that tender love which she had smothered in her heart
for so many years, and which flamed out now, threatening 
to consume her prudence, and to mock the precautions 
which she had so carefully taken; but Agatha was an 
actress who needed no prompting in her part. She seldom
forgot even the most subtle intricacies, and was always 
on her guard. In the short hours of that day she had
indemnified herself for the cruel privation under which 
she had so long suffered, and the effort to keep her emotions 
under the control of her will was almost superhuman. </p>

<!-- page 133 -->

<p>The mistakes of youth are but the erroneous deductions 
of inexperience. It is not, therefore, surprising that 
Kitty should have believed that she had reached the acme
of human enjoyment, and that she should have given up 
herself, heart and soul, to the delusion of the hour. 
Dinner was over, and while the gentlemen resorted to the 
piazza to smoke, Agatha drew Kitty to a sofa near the 
window, and with consummate art beguiled from her the 
history of her simple life. She smiled when Kitty spoke 
of John Maribel with a manner not yet divorced from 
the innocence of childish frankness, and she was well satisfied 
when her practised eye failed to discover those
signs which are the unmistakable evidences of an awakened 
heart.</p>

<p>When Gaston de Rousy stood leaning gracefully just 
within the window, holding a cigar daintily between his 
fingers, Agatha said, giving him a meaning glance: "Miss 
Pitkin has been charmingly entertaining, Gaston. You 
cannot think how much I have enjoyed her account of 
her life with Grandfather Pitkin and good Dr. Maribel."</p>

<p>"Miss Pitkin looks as if she had been brought up in a
court. It is difficult to associate her with any other life 
than one of elegance and refinement," answered De Rousy.</p>

<p>Kitty blushed painfully; for the first in her life 
she felt unreconciled to her simple, not to say homely, 
friends. The words of De Rousy had struck at the root 
of her contentment; the consciousness of inferiority of 

<!-- page 134 -->

position brought with it a sense of humiliation, and she 
wished&mdash;oh! with how much of girlish earnestness&mdash;that 
she had been born to the beautiful life which, she believed, 
had made Agatha's existence one long continuation of repeating 
pleasures&mdash;of ever-recurring happiness.</p>

<p>Gaston threw away his cigar, and took a chair beside 
her. Poor Kitty grew painfully confused under the 
somewhat bold glance of his eyes. He was really admiring 
her lovely features, and took no trouble to conceal 
the fact.</p>

<p>No one knew better than De Rousy how to use the 
advantages of person and manner for which he was distinguished; 
and while he allowed his eyes a somewhat 
daring avowal, his words were kept within the bounds of 
the most respectful politeness. He enjoyed immensely 
talking to her; while she, all unconsciously, was revealing 
to him graces of mind and a freshness of heart which 
made him reluctant to give up an enjoyment which was 
rarely attainable in the world in which he lived. He 
was therefore but ill pleased when Agatha joined them.</p>

<p>"Dr. Maribel tells me that you sing, Miss Pitkin," 
she said; "pray, give me the pleasure of listening to 
you."</p>

<p>"My voice," replied Kitty, simply, "is, I believe, a good 
one, but altogether uncultivated. You will, I am sure, 
excuse me, Mrs. Wilbraham, although it would give me 
pleasure to oblige you."</p>

<!-- page 135 -->

<p>With the tact of true politeness Agatha gave up the 
point, understanding that unwilling compliance is fatal to 
good execution. "I will sing to you instead, dear," she 
said, laying her hand for an instant on Kitty's beautiful 
hair. "Gaston, will you place my music-book on the 
piano and turn to <i>Ombra Leggiera?</i> You have never 
heard an opera, Miss Pitkin?" she added; "you have 
then great enjoyment in store. Come and stand beside 
me while I sing."</p>

<p>Seating herself at the piano, she commenced the graceful 
rippling measure, executing with marvellous taste the 
conception of Meyerbeer, and performing with the utmost 
delicacy and skill the very difficult task of accompanist, 
making the instrument subservient to the music, and 
blending the two into a perfect and delightful harmony: 
never forgetting the reciprocal interest which should 
exist between the poet and composer, or that the voice and 
the instrument are mutually dependent upon each other. 
An educated taste would at once have detected the talent 
of the singer and an excellent method which enabled her 
to seize the meaning of the master and to do full justice 
to his inspirations. Nature leaves to art the perfecting 
of her work, and Agatha had cultivated with ardor the 
gift bestowed upon her. How beseechingly she uttered
those words:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"<i>Ne t'en va pas! Ne t'en va pas!</i>"</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<!-- page 136 -->

<p>How tenderly:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"<i>Pour te s&eacute;duire,<br/>

Je viens sourire,<br/>

Je veux chanter.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Kitty was spell-bound. Her eyes grow soft and tender; 
a flush suffused her check; her small, white hands 
were clasped before her, and her tall figure was slightly 
bent forward, as she listened in wrapt delight. Gaston de 
Rousy scarcely heeded the music. He was contemplating 
with passionate enjoyment the fresh beauty of the young 
girl; and John Maribel stood by the window taking in 
all the scene&mdash;reading the hard lesson which was each 
moment becoming plainer to him. What else could he see 
in the looks of the man before him, so far his superior&mdash;he 
thought&mdash;in those graces which are acquired only by 
contact with a polite world?</p>

<p>Col. Covington, Wilbraham's nearest neighbor, a gentleman 
of cultivation and high social position, was standing 
beside him.</p>

<p>"Doctor," he said, "I believe I never so truly enjoy 
myself as I do when I am listening to Mrs. Wilbraham 
sing. That full, rich voice seems scarcely to belong to 
one so very frail and slight as she is."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered John Maribel, absently, "she certainly 
looks frail; but, Colonel, is it fancy, or does there 
really exist a likeness between Mrs. Wilbraham and 

<!-- page 137 -->

Kitty? Fill out Mrs. Wilbraham's face&mdash;give her Kitty's 
golden locks&mdash;and the resemblance would be striking."</p>

<p>"We sometimes see these freaks of nature," said Col.
Covington; "but in this instance she has certainly 
improved upon her model. Miss Pitkin is, and always 
will be, a handsomer woman than Mrs. Wilbraham; and 
now that they have separated; the resemblance weakens; 
for, however alike in feature, the expression of the clear, 
tender eyes of Miss Pitkin is in striking contrast to the 
restless orbs of Mrs. Wilbraham."</p>

<p>"Kitty," said John Maribel&mdash;she had joined then, and 
they had walked out on the terrace&mdash;"my holiday is well-nigh 
spent. Are you ready to go home?"</p>

<p>Can we blame the young creature?</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Such a note of life<br/>

Swarmed in the golden present; such a voice<br/>

Called to her from the year to come, and such<br/>

Length of bright horizon"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>shone in lambent serenity far over the alluring, untravelled 
future&mdash;can we blame her that her heart was 
panged at thought of going back to the shop? As she 
hesitated for a moment to reply&mdash;only a moment, for she 
was too truly loyal to swerve from her duty&mdash;Col. Covington, 
with the privilege of age, laughingly expressed his
envy at Dr. Maribel's good fortune in having the pleasure 
of riding <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with so charming a companion. 

<!-- page 138 -->

"And now," he continued, "I have a request to proffer.
Will you, Doctor, prevail upon Miss Pitkin to make us a 
visit? Mrs. Covington, I am sure, is most anxious to 
know her, and will accuse me of a want of proper gallantry 
should I fail to take to her a promise from you to 
give us the pleasure at an early day."</p>

<p>"With all my heart, Colonel," answered John Maribel, 
reading something like entreaty in Kitty's eyes; "<i>I</i> ask 
nothing better. But my patients sadly interfere with my 
liberty, and I cannot fix the time for our visit. You may 
depend that we will not postpone it a day longer than we 
can help."</p>

<p>A few moments later Kitty stood ready for her departure. 
Agatha was saying some parting words to her; and as she 
turned to accept De Rousy's escort to the buggy, she bent 
forward and kissed her. It was all done so rapidly that 
Kitty had scarcely time for astonishment. De Rousy 
handed her to the buggy&mdash;the old-fashioned, ridiculous-looking 
vehicle which she had hitherto looked upon as a 
delightful conveyance. He arranged her dress carefully 
about the dainty feet, and then, with a courtly bow, a
scarcely perceptible pressure of the hand, he withdrew, 
while John Maribel took his place beside her.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XX.</p>

<p class="small">"OUR OLD AND FAITHFUL FRIEND."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Col. Covington</span> was ever an honored and a 
welcome guest at Worleigh. His commanding 
social qualities, winning authority for his uncommon 
colloquial powers and elegant manners, would have 
distinguished him even in court circles. Here he was not 
only admired, but sincerely beloved, and the children of 
his oldest and dearest friend, beyond all others, appreciated 
the noble traits of his character as well as the constancy 
and firmness of his long-tried friendship. With a lofty 
and martial air he bore his seventy years. His clear, blue 
eye still kindled with the fire of his brilliant intellect, 
when, as he warmed on the subject in hand, his opinions, 
which were decidedly conservative, found expression in 
language remarkable for its perspicuity and force. Men 
gathered around him in every public place of meeting; and 
whether his quiet humor moved them to merriment, or
his earnest words chained their attention, he was ever the 
centre of every circle, courteous to all, but particularly 
urbane in his manner to those not belonging to his own 
class. A gentleman of the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i>, his home was 
emphatically the home of his friends. The old Colonel 

<!-- page 140 -->

was never so sincerely gratified as while dispensing the 
liberal and elegant hospitality for which he was so distinguished; 
and he occupied his hale old age in superintending 
his plantation, in beautifying his grounds, and attending 
to those domestic vocations which were congenial to 
his taste. The white hair, which had lost none of its luxuriance, 
crowned him with the venerableness of age without 
indications of its apparent infirmities, while his teeth&mdash;the 
absence of which warns old age of decay&mdash;were still 
remarkable for their perfectness. His florid complexion&mdash;inherited 
from his Saxon ancestry&mdash;added to his appearance 
of robust health. This boon, so precious to one who 
had passed the allotted span of man's existence, might, in 
a great measure, have been attributed to the extreme simplicity 
of his habits, which bore a striking analogy to the 
primitive customs of the first settlers.</p>

<p>Happy is he who can look back over seventy years of 
time and feel that his name is inseparably connected with 
deeds of noble charity and acts of disinterested friendship.
Happy is the father whose gray hairs are made sacred by 
the love and veneration of children; brighter than a 
saint's <i>aureole</i> is the halo of a noble life!</p>

<p>Miss Eleanor Wilbraham had been confined to her 
couch during the greater part of the day with headache.
She had come out, pale and languid, and stood now talking 
to her old friend. Well did she know that he carried 
a heart peculiarly susceptible of her sorrows and anxieties.

<!-- page 141 -->

For years they had maintained an intimate and unreserved 
intercourse, and, during the minority of Hugh, he 
had acted as his guardian. It was so natural for Miss 
Eleanor to unburden herself unreservedly to him of her 
troubles that he was scarcely astonished, at her expressed 
uneasiness.</p>

<p>"Would that Hugh were here," she said; "I am at 
a loss how to advise Agatha; and even had I the temerity 
to do so, would she, think you, bend her capricious 
will to reasons suggested by prudence?"</p>

<p>"My dear Eleanor," answered Col. Covington, "Hugh's 
absence at this juncture is most unfortunate. While I
acknowledge Mrs. Wilbraham's superiority as a woman of 
the world, and do homage to her rare accomplishments, I 
nevertheless deplore the mistake which Hugh has made.
I fear that his marital relations are insecure; that is, that 
there is a total want of congeniality between them, which 
he, poor fellow, has not yet divined, and which God 
knows to what evils it may lead in its train. We old 
people are apt to judge from our own arbitrary standpoint; 
we belong to a past, which was rigid in its condemnation 
of whatever smirched the ermine of wifely duty 
and obedience. Morality to-day takes a wider scope. I
fear it is no longer kept within the bounds prescribed by 
the just regard for high rectitude. Women in our day 
were emulous of excellence in housewifery, and seldom 
went beyond the precincts of home to seek pleasure, much 

<!-- page 142 -->

less admiration. We must be indulgent, Eleanor. The 
tide of progress is tending to a different course of things, 
and much that we cordially disapprove is buoyed up to 
the surface of the world's lenient judgment. I have 
learned somewhat to mistrust my own judgment, so fatally 
have I erred in the management of my affairs."</p>

<p>"I will not have you thus blame yourself, dear, old 
friend," replied Miss Eleanor. "Your proud rectitude 
has only made you little too indulgent towards those to 
whom you have so conspicuously displayed a generosity, 
which seems not to have repressed their ingratitude. You 
have always taken men at your own valuation. You 
ought to know what mischief lurks in the simplicity of 
such honesty."</p>

<p>"Aye! I ought to know, my good friend&mdash;I ought to 
know that it is not safe to judge men from too high a standpoint. 
As a general thing, their moral organization will 
not bear the test of complete trust in its integrity. It is 
but just to ourselves to reserve our confidence until a man 
has proved himself worthy of its trust. It is wisest to 
look upon a man's intentions towards one's self with a certain 
defiance, reserving always sincere approbation for 
whatever he may possess that is excellent in heart or 
mind, which may be developed on better acquaintance;
but how woefully have I failed to put this fine morality 
to practice. Good-bye, Eleanor. Cheer up; things are
seldom so bad that they can't be remedied."</p>

<!-- page 143 -->

<p>"Unfortunately," replied Miss Eleanor, "we cannot 
always apply the remedy when we find one. Now, Mr. de 
Rousy's absence would greatly conduce to my peace of 
mind."</p>

<p>Col. Covington looked grave as he answered:</p>

<p>"Your jealousy for Hugh is carrying you too far, 
Eleanor. Surely there is nothing extraordinary in Mrs. 
Wilbraham's liking for her cousin."</p>

<p>"No," said Miss Eleanor, coloring, "nothing at all in 
<i>that;</i> but I am, as you say, over-jealous for Hugh. A 
poor, doating, old sister, who has all her life made to herself 
an idol, and fallen down, and worshipped it, I am now 
reaping the reward of those who do such things. You 
know how proudly I looked forward to his majority. 
You know the dreams of ambition I have entertained for 
him and there's no wonder, when poor father&mdash;from the 
time that I made Hugh his first trowsers&mdash;was always 
saying that his head was the most wonderful development 
of the highest order of faculties and,&mdash;&mdash;Ah, me!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes dear Eleanor," answered the old gentleman, 
with a movement of slight impatience&mdash;men have so little 
tolerance of doating mothers and sisters over boyish 
phenomena&mdash;"but I know, with your firm faith, it will 
not be difficult to extract exalted lessons from the pages 
of your past life, and through the alembic of patience you
may perhaps attain that peace which is the essence of 
earthly happiness."</p>

<!-- page 144 -->

<p>Miss Eleanor watched him as he rode down the avenue 
on his thoroughbred, that knew from long service that his 
good master would permit him to go at a gait no faster 
than a gentle pace.</p>

<p>"Ah, me!" she thought, "there is no question but that 
our own acts have a great deal to do with our misfortunes; 
but that they fall more crushingly upon some than upon 
others, none can deny. It is consoling to think, that as we 
are loved, so are we chastened."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXI.</p>

<p class="small">"TAKE UP THE CORSE, SIRS."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> street lamps glimmered pale beneath a clear, 
starlit sky as John Maribel and Kitty reached 
town. People sat upon door-steps and beneath 
verandahs, while windows were set wide open to catch the 
fickle breeze, which stirred the catalpa leaves, and brought 
the perfume of the far-off woods to those who had no time 
to go forth into country lanes and byways to seek it.</p>

<p>The confectionery shops were filled with people, who sat
around tables, under festoons of colored paper garlanded 

<!-- page 145 -->

with flies, drinking sherbets and eating creams; while the 
weary dry-goods clerk across the street, sweltering in the 
gas-lit shop, looked vacantly away from the old lady upon 
whom he was waiting to the more fortunate human beings 
who possessed the means of enjoyment, which, at that moment, 
were out of his reach. The grocer's clerk, next door, 
was scarcely less despondent than his neighbor, as he carried 
in the boxes and rolled in the barrels, which were to 
be set out again the next morning for the benefit of the 
passers-by, who might be tempted by the smell of mackerel 
or by the sight of liquefied butter. The close, hot town&mdash;the 
sight of the shops&mdash;the noise and bustle of the streets&mdash;the 
flaring gas-light&mdash;everything which reminded her of 
the life to which she was going back, when they turned
into Broad street, was hateful to Kitty.</p>

<p>"John," said she, in a tone of alarm, "the shop-window 
has not been lighted. Something is amiss with grandfather. 
Ah! there is Jope. Look at his face, John, look
at his face!"</p>

<p>Jope was standing in the full glare of the street-lamp, 
and his face was plainly visible to them. As Kitty sprang 
from the buggy, he clutched her arm, saying:</p>

<p>"You mustn't go in, Miss Kitty. Doctor, don't let her 
go."</p>

<p>She broke away from John's detaining hand and rushed
into the shop. The door of the parlor was locked&mdash;her
frantic efforts to open it were futile. An object of grief 

<!-- page 146 -->

and terror hard to depict, Jope stood in the middle of the 
floor, repeating, "You mustn't go in, Miss Kitty. Doctor, 
don't let her go."</p> 

<p>"Explain yourself" said John Maribel, taking him 
roughly by the arm; "what do you mean by refusing to 
open that door? Give me the key at once."</p>

<p>"Remember, Doctor, if any harm comes to Miss Kitty, 
that it's you as will be the cause. I tell you, she oughtn't
to go in there."</p>

<p>Dr. Maribel had taken the key from his reluctant hand, 
and, in a moment, they stood within the dark room.</p>

<p>"Grandfather, grandfather, where are you?" cried 
Kitty, in a voice shrill with anxiety.</p>

<p>There was no response&mdash;no sound, save the scraping of 
the match which John Maribel's trembling hand failed to 
ignite. Even this slight delay was a relief; for he 
guessed too surely what would meet their eyes. Another 
effort to obtain a light was more successful, and, as the 
match ignited, giving out its sputtering blueish flame, 
Kitty caught sight of the old man's prostrate form. She 
flew to his side, and, kneeling beside him, exclaimed in 
tones of tender entreaty:</p>

<p>"How could you lie here, grandfather, when your bed 
was so near? You have wanted me&mdash;you have missed 
your Kitty. I have come back to you. Do you hear, 
dear grandfather? I have come back. Ah! John, he does 
not answer."</p>

<!-- page 147 -->

<p>"No, dear," he replied, his practised eye having at once
detected the hopelessness of all human succor, "grandfather 
has reached the end of his long journey."</p>

<p>She turned and looked into John Maribel's face&mdash;he 
was kneeling close beside her&mdash;with a gaze of puzzled, 
agonized inquiry in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Kitty, darling, perhaps I ought to have told you that 
for some time grandfather has been threatened with this 
sudden catastrophe."</p>

<p>She became so white that he put his arm about her; 
the trembling figure was drawn close to his bosom, and 
her arms went up around his neck. For a moment John 
Maribel forgot the dead old man&mdash;forgot the awful presence 
which made the indulgence of human passion a sacrilege. 
The throbbing form in his arms was all the world 
to him. The intoxication that came over his senses well-nigh, 
in its delirious joy, caused him to forget the noble 
resolve which had hitherto been inviolate. Jope's sobs 
aroused him from his transient delirium. The boy stood 
leaning against the frame of the door, his eyes fixed upon 
Kitty, and his face quivering. His grief was altogether 
in sympathy with hers. He scarcely gave a thought to 
the old man, or, if he did, it was with a sense of relief that 
his bondage was over. To have spared Kitty this sorrow, 
he would have been willing to serve old Pitkin to the end 
of his life. Each plaint of hers went to his heart with cutting 
misery; but the shop-door had been left open, and 

<!-- page 148 -->

people, with the peculiar instinct which prompts curiosity 
even on occasions of sorrow and death, began to crowd in.</p>

<p>"Kitty," said John Maribel, "you must not stay here."</p>

<p>She rose at once&mdash;her grief was so touching in its gentleness. 
"No," she said, "I must not stay here."</p>

<p>Kitty went into the room where she had slept for so 
many years in little Martha's bed. Nothing had been 
changed since then. The white dimity curtain at the window, 
with the knotted fringe, the valance around the bed, 
the blue and pink wax-candles on the mantel-shelf, and 
the great Bible, the hymn-book, and "Baxter's Saints'
Rest" on the little table at the head of the bed. She had 
seen them a thousand times before, but not as now. The 
halo of association gave to each detail a tender meaning.
She recalled events of her childhood long since forgotten&mdash;words 
spoken to her by the old people&mdash;which came 
out vividly now in the train of memory. How gentle
they had always been to her; how loving in their own 
simple ways. Oh! in this world would she ever again 
find a love like theirs? Even grandfather, hard and unbending 
as he was to others, for her had always a smile or 
a tender word. She remembered with shameful remorse 
that on that very day she had swerved from her duty to 
these humble friends. Death with ruthless hand tears 
the veil from before our eyes, and shows us ourselves as 
we are. We dare not, in the presence of his awful majesty, 
trick ourselves out in self-deceitful illusions; we 

<!-- page 149 -->

dare not salve ourselves with the unction of our own self-importance. 
No; when he is there we comprehend the 
frail tenure of humanity. The ignoble calculations of the 
ambitious worldling, the evanescent pleasure of indulged 
passion, the soothing charm of beauty, the satisfaction of 
money-getting, the triumphs of science, or art, or action&mdash;all 
pale before the reality of this grim reminder of their 
short-lived triumphs.</p>

<p>Kitty forgot the delights of Worleigh, the fascinations
of Agatha, the charm of Gaston de Rousy's conversation, 
in the one thought of her recent shortcoming in her duty 
to the poor old man. It was a relief to her sad thoughts 
when John opened the door and beckoned to her.</p>

<p>"Come with me, dear Kitty," he whispered; "you 
need rest and refreshment."</p>

<p>She put her hand into his with childlike confidence. 
It was so natural to accept the love which he gave, and 
never to question her right to take it. The beauty of 
John Maribel's devotion was that it was so little obtrusive
that it could only have been divined by the delicate
instinct of a responsive feeling. The noble characteristics 
of a truly ingenuous nature are so intricately interwoven
in the commonplace motives and actions of life that we
may go on for years without discovering them. We are
satisfied, at least, that we are dealing with a thoroughly 
safe and worthy person, without troubling ourselves to 
look for the hidden springs of his action. Just as we see 

<!-- page 150 -->

a sunset, and do not take in its multiform varieties of 
color, its marvellous changes from burning glow into the 
mellowed paling of violet light; just as we walk through 
God's domain, half blind to the beauty which unfolds at 
every step&mdash;so do we go on our way, unheeding moral excellence, 
until our obtuseness is quickened by having it 
palpably brought before our senses by some unexpected 
trial, some event which brings it to light and calls it into 
action.</p>

<p>Hundreds of people knew John Maribel, and with the 
greater portion of them he was the "best fellow in the 
world;" a little too free with his money, a little loose
about business which concerned only his own welfare, 
notorious for forgetting to send bills to people in difficulties, 
and having a charity practice which was a positive 
folly. Deductions from these facts were perhaps not 
more erroneous than the world's judgment usually is. A
man's life will, in the end, generally tell its own tale.</p>

<p>As he crossed the threshold of his home that night with 
Kitty, he experienced the terrible trial of conflict between
passion and honor which so sorely shakes the soul. He 
would have taken her in his arms and comforted her; he 
would have asked her to lean upon his great love; but he 
felt that it would have been ungenerous, even cowardly, 
thus to profit by her helplessness.</p>

<p>"No," he thought, "Kitty shall have fair play. I 
must run my chance with the others."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXII.</p>

<p class="small">"OH, GO YOU FAR?"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A week</span> after Mr. Pitkin's death, a man, travel-worn 
and evidently weary, was slowly making 
his way along a secluded country road, stopping 
from time to time, and looking about him with an uneasy 
and undecided manner, which plainly indicated that he 
was uncertain of his course. His perplexity had brought 
him to the determination that he had better retrace his 
steps to the mill, which was just below in the valley, when 
the slow grinding of wheels through the sand, and the 
crack of a whip, fell upon his ear. An ox-cart soon appeared 
in sight, and walking by the side of the oxen was a 
tall old countryman, who brought out with his deep 
sonorous voice the <i>gees</i> and <i>whoas</i> which encouraged the 
patient animals to greater speed.</p>

<p>"Will you be so kind as to direct me to the nearest 
house where I may obtain rest and refreshment?" said the 
stranger, walking along by his side.</p>

<p>The old man raised his hat and passed his blue cotton 
handkerchief over his brow, examining in the meantime 
his interlocutor with keen scrutiny.</p>

<!-- page 152 -->

<p>"You may as well go along with me," he said, seemingly 
satisfied; "my house is just on the rise of the next 
hill. It's the nearest hereabout, and I reckon my old 
woman has got breakfast ready."</p>

<p>"I am really quite grateful for the prospect of food and 
rest," answered the stranger. "I am exhausted from a 
long walk over the country."</p>

<p>"Might you be a preacher?" asked the old man.</p>

<p>"Oh no! would that I were half so worthy of your 
esteem, as are those self-denying men. You may rest 
assured, however, that I will not abuse your hospitality,
or prove unworthy of the confidence which you show in
inviting me to your house."</p>

<p>" 'He that watereth, shall be watered also himself,' " said
the old man. "I never turned a stranger from my door, 
or refused to break bread with him. You are welcome to 
such as I have to offer."</p>

<p>They had turned into the lane that led to the stable, 
which stood in rear of the house. The latter was a tall, 
narrow structure, with a piazza in front, and chimneys 
built of brick on the outside. A well-house stood on the
left, and a garden filled with old-fashioned flowers
and fragrant herbs evidenced careful culture; while a thriving 
orchard of peach and apple trees bordered the lane.
The oxen were driven into the yard, where the cart was to 
be unloaded. While the yokes were being removed from 
their necks, and the tired animals turned into the pasture, 

<!-- page 153 -->

the stranger sat down at the barn-door, and his eye 
wandered over the goodly landscape spread out in field 
and meadow beneath him. The expression on his face 
was that of one recalling a familiar scene, rather than of 
awakened pleasure in something which was strange and 
new to him. He was aroused from his reverie by the 
voice of the old man inviting him to enter the house.</p>

<p>"Susan," he said, as they entered the room where the 
good woman was laying the table for breakfast, "I have 
brought a stranger home with me. I hope you have got 
breakfast ready, for he is tired and hungry. Where's 
Abby?"</p>

<p>She shook hands with the stranger, and placed a chair 
for him, before she answered: "Abby has gone to the 
spring, father. You know you always want fresh water 
when you come in."</p>

<p>At that moment the guest, who was sitting near the 
open window, saw a young girl bearing a small water-pail 
on her head and stepping lightly through the grass wet 
with dew, holding her skirts above her ankles with so
natural a grace that he was attracted to observe her more 
closely when she came in, after having placed the pail on 
the water-shelf, which was at the end of the piazza, and 
held buckets, gourds, and a tin wash-basin for the convenience 
of the family.</p>

<p>She was undoubtedly a handsome girl: tall, lithe, and 
well-shaped. Her black velvety eyes were, perhaps, a 

<!-- page 154 -->

little bold&mdash;her complexion, brown with the sun-tan, was 
rich with the bloom of perfect health, and the firm round 
outlines of her figure were scarcely disguised by the plain 
fashion of her calico dress. Hair of a reddish brown hue
contrasted well with the eyes, and though the lips were 
too full, and her mouth somewhat large, one forgot this 
defect when she laughed, displaying her perfect white 
teeth. The stranger rose and bowed to her, with a manner 
which marked him at once as one who was familiar with 
the usages of a polite world. The girl was instinctively 
conscious of his homage, and her heightened color testified 
to her gratification.</p>

<p>"That's my daughter," said the old man, "the only one 
of six, which the Lord has spared to us."</p>

<p>"You are in a great measure compensated," said the 
stranger, "by the possession of a daughter whose charms 
are well calculated to fill your heart with pride."</p>

<p>"She's well enough," the father replied, not ill-pleased 
with the stranger's praise of her beauty, and looking at her 
with a glance of unwonted tenderness, as she moved about 
setting the dishes on the table.</p>

<p>Hillside farm belonged to Miss Eleanor Wilbraham, 
and for many years had been leased to Mark Blackwell, 
who had been an overseer for her father, and by him 
highly esteemed for his upright character and the zeal with 
which he discharged his duties. He was a tall, powerfully 
built man, rugged as the gnarled oak, and as unbending 

<!-- page 155 -->

in his probity. His white hair was combed back from 
a high furrowed forehead, and heavy grizzled brows overshadowed 
eyes searching in their glance and capable of a 
terrible severity when kindled by anger. Deep lines were 
traced around his firm mouth, and the square heavy jaw 
characterized his face with a resolute firmness. His religion 
was the gloomy faith of the Puritan, in which God's
justice overrules His mercy, and the thunder of His 
wrath is ever menacing the erring sinner. His simple 
code of morality was taken from the teachings of Solomon, 
and it was his boast that he had ever walked uprightly 
before God and man. Though hard of speech and unflinching 
in his condemnation of wrong, yet in his own 
way he was a tender husband, and with a weakness inconsistent, 
but by no means rare, he permitted his handsome 
daughter to have her own way in spite of his severe 
reproofs backed by the authority of the wise man.</p>

<p>When they had seated themselves around the table, he 
crossed his large brown hands reverently before him, and, 
with bowed head and subdued tone, asked a blessing over 
those gifts for which in his heart he was earnestly thankful. 
With a hospitality characteristic of country people, 
he pressed the stranger to partake of the excellent breakfast, 
and, when they had risen from table, he assured 
him that he would be glad of his company and that they 
could furnish him a bed, should he feel disposed to stay 
until the next day.</p>

<!-- page 156 -->

<p>"I am heartily obliged to you, Mr. Blackwell; but if 
you will permit me to sit for a couple of hours under the 
shade of your piazza, I think I shall be sufficiently rested 
to proceed on my way," answered the stranger.</p>

<p>"May I ask where you are journeying to?" said 
Blackwell.</p>

<p>"To the old Featherstone place. It can be no great 
distance from here."</p>

<p>"What, you are going there!" exclaimed Blackwell.
"It's a ruin&mdash;house and garden; and the place has a bad 
reputation. The niggers won't go by there after sundown."</p>

<p>"I suppose the desolation of the place has engendered 
superstitious fears. I must confess that, since my brief
residence there, I have been disturbed with no other 
ghosts than those conferred by memories attached to the 
place. I know something of the sad story of the family 
whose home it once was."</p>

<p>"May I be so bold as to ask your name, sir?" said 
Blackwell. "I have lived about here nigh on to thirty 
years, and I know most of the families in this and the 
next county."</p>

<p>"I have not the slightest objection to giving you 
my name&mdash;indeed, I believe I have been guilty of a discourtesy 
in not having done so before. It is James Pultney."</p>

<p>Blackwell pondered a moment, looked searchingly at 

<!-- page 157 -->

Mr. Pultney, and then asked: "May you be related to 
the Featherstones?"</p>

<p>"By the by," said Mr. Pultney, evading the question, 
"do you happen, my friends, to know the circumstances 
attending the death of old Mr. Featherstone? They 
were, I think, of a sad and peculiar nature."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Blackwell, "I remember there was a
good deal of talk when he came back; and, instead of 
going to the old place, he stopped at Mapleton and 
bought Stony-hill. Trouble had changed him into a 
miserly, crabbed old man, and when he was taken down, 
so that he couldn't leave his bed, he sent for Dr. Maribel 
and he attended on him till he died. The heaviest
snow-storm as ever fell in this country&mdash;and you know 
it's a rare thing to have snow at all&mdash;came on the day that 
he died. I heard say, that just at dusk a woman was 
seen by old Uriah Thom&mdash;who was passing along with a
load of wood&mdash;going down the hill from the house, and 
that she disappeared all of a sudden, and nothing more
was ever seen or heard of her. I always believed, for my 
part, that Uriah had his jug along, and his eyes wasn't to 
be trusted. However this may be, it happened that when 
Dr. Maribel went to see the old man, just about dark, he 
found him dead, and a child sitting by the bed. I had it 
from Tim Perkins, who drove the stage, that Dr. Maribel 
went to the Red Tavern with the child, and took her to 
town that night."</p>

<!-- page 158 -->

<p>"And the child has lived with him ever since?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing about that; leastways, as to what became 
of the child. I am pretty sure, however, that she's 
not living with Dr. Maribel. I have been to his house
after him for my old woman, and I see but a poor old 
cripple there, as he has supported this many years. The
Doctor was up at Worleigh the other day. You can 
see the chimneys of the house from here&mdash;just look 
through those trees."</p>

<p>Mr. Pultney's eyes wandered over the wooded hills and 
undulating fields; but he turned away with a sigh; and 
seemed indisposed for further conversation.</p>

<p>Blackwell cast a curious glance upon him as he seated 
himself in the shadow of the climbing rose-vine. The 
man was evidently a prey to sorrow, and he was won to 
sympathy, in spite of his usually guarded indulgence in a 
sentiment, which he held to be treacherous, in some 
measure, to severe judgment. He took his hoe and rake, 
and went off to his vegetables. As he drew up the earth 
about the squash-hills, his thoughts centred upon the one 
absorbing joy of his life&mdash;Abby&mdash;the child of his old age&mdash;the 
wayward spoiled darling, who every day of her life 
outraged his ideas of maiden propriety and went in the 
face of his stern precepts, laughing him out of his anger 
and winning him to yield to her desires. No sooner did 
he comply with a caprice, than he repented him bitterly of 
his weakness; but this repentance was barren of fruit.

<!-- page 159 -->

Abby had her own way. With secret satisfaction, Mark
Blackwell had watched Perry Deane's growing attachment 
for the girl. From his point of view, he was an
excellent match for his daughter. Sober, industrious, and 
frugal, a skilled workman and a God-fearing man&mdash;what 
more could he ask for in a son-in-law? Married to a 
man like Perry, Abby would become a domestic wife 
and the vagaries of youth would gradually yield to 
the duties which marriage would develop. It would 
be monstrously unnatural for a father to judge his 
only daughter otherwise than leniently&mdash;at least, until 
she had outraged his love and confidence; and now,
as Blackwell went on with his work, he sang, in 
low deep voice, "A charge to keep I have," thinking 
the while of Abby, and persistently shutting his eyes 
to those defects of character, which were so salient that 
few in the country round failed to see them, and, with 
proverbial charity, to prophesy the result of their unchecked 
indulgence.</p>

<p>At that very moment, Abby was at the spring, at the 
foot of the hill, her eyes glowing with gratified vanity as 
she looked at a ring with a ruby in the setting, which 
Gaston de Rousy was urging her to accept. His gun and 
game-bag were laid aside, and he stood leaning against a 
tree, his eyes fixed upon her with that bold admiration 
which savored of disrespect.</p>

<p>"Ah! why thank me for so poor a bauble? I only 

<!-- page 160 -->

gave it to you to cause you sometimes to think of me. 
I'm afraid you need a reminder, Abby."</p>

<p>"I don't see why you say that," she answered. "One 
can't help thinking, even when they oughtn't to. I
reckon I'll not come down here again. Perry will not 
like it. You know that I am as good as promised to 
him."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" exclaimed De Rousy, "do you suppose that 
muddle-headed carpenter cares half as much for you as 
I do?"</p> 

<p>"I don't know <i>how</i> much you care for me," the girl 
answered, giving him a shy, coquettish glance, and then 
casting her eyes down in feigned bashfulness.</p>

<p>"Don't you?" he replied, coming temptingly near her 
round waist and fresh-colored cheek. "Don't you?"
he said again in a tone which caused her instinctively to 
draw away from him; for, coquettish as she was&mdash;vain and 
light and unstable, she as yet was proof against any 
undue familiarity, and would have heartily resented the 
kiss which De Rousy evidently had intended to impress 
on her coral lips.</p>

<p>She was flattered at the attentions of this fine gentleman. 
She admired his handsome person, and adored 
his well-chosen jewelry and handsome attire. She was 
not proof against his presents, or insensible to his flattery;
but she had been brought up in a stern school. Virtue, 
among the class to which her parents belonged, was so 

<!-- page 161 -->

highly esteemed that any deviation from chastity was
visited with fatal condemnation.</p>

<p>Abby, with no very fixed principles of her own, was
perhaps influenced by a fear of consequences, and this
fear proved a safeguard to her.</p>

<p>Like many other women, she risked the loss of a true
man's love for the frippery attentions of a soulless libertine.</p>

<p>Abby filled her bucket from the gushing spring, and, as 
she poised it on her head, Gaston thought how in other 
lands she might reap gold where models were sought for 
by painter and sculptor.</p>

<div class="center" id="ch23">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIII.</p>

<p class="small">"WHERE RIDES HE THE WHILE?"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Perry</span> had promised Abby to be at home an hour 
earlier than usual; so he left off work at sunset. 
As he walked briskly along, he heard his 
name shouted by a familiar voice, and, stopping to ascertain 
whence it came, he perceived to his great astonishment
that it proceeded from Jope, who was progressing slowly 
across the meadow which separated the estate of Worleigh 

<!-- page 162 -->

from Hillside. Perry could scarcely refrain from laughing 
aloud at sight of the boy.</p>

<p>He rode a tall, lean horse, and he was perched on the 
top of a pair of saddle-bags which contained his worldly 
possessions. The jaunty hat and flaming neck-tie had 
again been assumed, and the soles of his new shoes were 
conspicuously visible as his legs, supported by the distended 
saddle-bags, stood out at right angles from the 
horse.</p>

<p>"How are you, Mr. Deane?" he cried with a jocular 
air, as he drew rein beside Perry. "You see that I am 
on the wing; and you will also notice, sir, that I'm in the 
best of spirits. Old Pitkin has acted handsome by me, and 
made up for the nightly searchings and the nutmegs. I 
didn't expect it, as how should I, when he never let me know 
but that he thought me the worse of the worst? There's 
nothing that scorches up the good in a man, sir, like 
suspection; and if old Pitkin had gone on a tapping of me 
and a watching me, well, I'd 'a got use' to the idea, and 
maybe turned thief; but he's acted handsome, and left me 
a clear fifty. I kinder think he was making up his account 
with the Lord, and he just settled for the extra work he 
got out of me."</p>

<p>Perry was walking by the side of the horse, his eyes 
cast down and his features working convulsively.  Jope's 
ridiculous figure&mdash;his assumption of the air of a well-to-do 
man&mdash;his supreme self-satisfaction, were so provocative of 

<!-- page 163 -->

laughter, that Perry with difficulty refrained from its
indulgence.</p>

<p>"You know my folks live at Hillside, just over there."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," answered Perry. "Are <i>they</i> your 
kinsfolk?"</p>

<p>"To be sure, Mr. Blackwell is my mother's own brother.
I haven't seen them this long while, because of a little 
difficulty betwixt me and my uncle. To tell you the 
truth, Mr. Deane, I have an inward sort of a feeling about 
meeting Uncle Mark. I run away from him, and he never 
as much as took the trouble to ask where I went to. He 
called me a gallows-bird, and flung Solomon at me as 
I ran through the gate. I had as well say that the 
ox-whip was in his hand, and I daren't go back for fear 
of it."</p>

<p>"It makes all the difference in the world, Jope," said 
Perry, with a merry twinkle in his eye, "when a runaway 
returns to home with a good coat to his back and 
money in his purse. Money 'makes all doctrines plain 
and clear.' "</p>

<p>"Well," answered Jope, "I reckon forty-five dollars of 
hard-earned cash, and a character, will do the thing for 
me."</p>

<p>By this time they had approached the house, and Mrs. 
Blackwell&mdash;who was standing on the piazza&mdash;espied the 
traveller.</p>

<p>"Abby," she cried, "there's some one coming with 

<!-- page 164 -->

Perry. Your eyes are better the mine; see if you can 
make out who it is."</p>

<p>Abby had undergone a complete transformation. Her
plain calico had been replaced by a flaunting pink muslin,
which was made in unsuccessful imitation of the prevailing 
fashion. A ribbon confined her hair, and a set of cheap 
jewelry completed the vulgarity of her appearance. She
wore Gaston de Rousy's ring on her finger. 

<p>Her mother gave her a startled look. "Abby," she said, 
in a deprecatory tone, "I am real sorry you bought that 
dress, and I can't say that I like the make of it. Your 
white muslin looks beautiful. I ironed it myself to-day, 
thinking you would put it on. There's a good girl; go before 
father comes and take off that pink thing."</p>

"I've worn that white dress until I'm fairly sick of it; 
so I don't mean to take this off. Why, mother, there's 
Jope!" she exclaimed, running out to meet her cousin.</p>

<p>Abby thought, as she shook hands with him, that time 
had scarcely improved his looks or his manners. The
truth was that the poor fellow was in no little trepidation 
as to his welcome from his dreaded uncle, and Mrs. Blackwell, 
seeing this, put her arm about his shoulders, and 
said soothingly:</p>

<p>"What is past, is past, Jope. Your uncle is kinder 
than you think. Although you haven't heard from us this 
long time, he has had news of you, and knows that you are
honest and hard-working."</p>

<!-- page 165 -->

<p>This was indeed consoling to the boy, and he placed his
saddle-bags on the floor, with the confident air of a man 
who is conscious of possessing the means of insuring a 
welcome.</p>

<p>Perry had gone up to his little room under the roof to 
change his working clothes for the suit of black broadcloth, 
which had done him service for many a year. As 
he brushed out his luxuriant beard, and gave a finishing 
touch to his cravat, he heard the old farmer's voice, raised 
in tones of anger. He had just come in from the barn, 
and, as his eye fell upon Abby, his ire burst all bounds.</p>

<p>"What's this!" he cried; "muslin and ribbins, gewgaws 
and furbelows! Where did you get that flimsy, flaunting 
thing, Abby?"</p>

<p>"I paid my own money for it, father," she answered, 
"It's hard I can't do as I please with my earnings."</p>

<p>As usual, Blackwell took refuge with Solomon.</p>

<p>" 'Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit 
before a fall.' Eh, Perry!" he exclaimed, as the young 
man came down the stairs. "You'll agree with me that 
them furbelows and fixens don't look right."</p>

<p>Perry felt the justice of the old man's remark. In his 
heart, he deplored Abby's taste for showy finery; and 
more than once had he attempted a gentle remonstrance. 
Now, as his eye took in the details of her costume, he discovered 
the ring. It replaced the simple gold circlet, 
which he had given her. The crimson cheeks and embarrassed 

<!-- page 166 -->

manner of the girl conveyed little comfort to him, 
and, in a dejected tone, he said:</p>

<p>"We had better be going, Abby, if we expect to get to 
Searing's by dark."</p>

<p>"I've been ready this hour; but I've half a mind not to 
go," she said.</p>

<p>"Never fret about what father says, dear," whispered
the indulgent mother. "You know he's old-fashioned in 
his ideas, and our church don't approve of too much dressing. 
Go along with Perry."</p>

<p>She watched them as they walked side by side down the 
box-bordered path. They passed out by a wicket into a 
narrow lane between the waves of the standing corn. The 
landscape lay all before them&mdash;the sweet west wind came
laden with fragrance, caught as it passed through forest 
dells and across the fields of corm, and orchards ladened 
with ripening fruit. She watched them, her old heart 
growing young in sympathy and foolishly tender towards 
the wayward girl. The glaring pink dress softened in 
tone until, as it passed from view, it was scarcely pinker 
than the rose-hued clouds tinted by the lingering sun-rays. 
Her heart exulted in the thought that, in all the country 
side, there was no maiden who could compare in beauty 
with her daughter.</p>

<p>The bats had come out from beneath the eaves, the fireflies 
fitted over the beds of thyme, and balm, and rosemary, 
the distant hooting of an owl caused the hens to 

<!-- page 167 -->

rest uneasy on their perches, and the cows returned lowing 
to the pasture after the milking. A still, clear night 
was wrapping the world in shadows.</p> 

<p>"I reckon, wife," said the old man, "they have taken 
the nigh way by the chapel."</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, "and it will be seven o'clock by 
the time they get to Searing's. Have you seen Jope?"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Why, Jope Perkins, your own sister's son. Where 
can he be, that you haven't seen him?"</p>

<p>"Here, aunt," said a voice, proceeding from around the 
corner of the house. At the same time Jope came forward, 
with a hesitating, embarrassed manner.</p>

<p>"Run away again, eh?" cried the old man.</p>

<p>"No, I haven't, sir," answered the boy. "I rode out 
of town on a hired horse, as I am able to pay for."</p>

<p>"Then you haven't come back upon me?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; him as I served, though hard and full of suspection 
and searchings, has done the handsome thing by 
me. I've got money in my purse, and needn't be beholden 
to no man."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Blackwell; "every young man's 
ambition ought to be to gain his own independence. You 
are right welcome, nephew. I'm willing to shake hands, 
and let bygones be bygones."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIV.</p>

<p class="small">"WHO GAVE IT YOU?"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> passed silently under the cone-dropping pines 
through a path scarcely defined, so thickly was 
it covered by the slippery needles, and, on the 
rise of a gradual slope, stood the chapel, gleaming white in 
the gray dusk. A low paling, half covered by Cherokee 
roses, inclosed the graveyard, and tall columns marking 
the resting places of the wealthy rose above the humbler 
slabs and head-tablets. The night air was perfumed by
the oleanders about the graves. No sound disturbed the 
stillness, save the croaking of the frogs in the creek swamp. 
Abby and Perry slackened their pace, as on the broad gravelled 
walk leading from the gate to the chapel they saw a 
man slowly walking, who was softly singing to himself.
Neither theme nor song they knew; but the touching pathos 
of the tones stirred their hearts, and the melody, in the 
hush of the gloaming, rose sweet and solemn from amid the 
sleeping dead. They did not know that, as he raised his 
eyes to the star-flecked heaven, the words, in a language uncouth 
to them, were addressed to her who is the mother of 
Christ; they did not know that this <i>Ave</i> was the creation 
of a great master, and that its melody had floated through 

<!-- page 169 -->

the dim aisles and lofty naves of grand old cathedrals in far-off 
lands across the sea. To them it was an evening hymn, 
sweeter than anything that they had ever heard; and 
they stood clasping each other's hands, listening until the 
last notes died away.</p>

<p>The singer had opened the gate, and stood in the road 
before he perceived them.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, sir," said Perry; "we were on our 
way to a neighbor's. You will excuse us for having 
lingered to listen to your singing."</p>

<p>"You find it strange, perhaps, to hear me singing an 
<i>Ave Maria</i> among the good Methodists who sleep here?"</p>

<p>"I am but a poor scholar," answered Perry, "and the 
differences of creed have always struck me as a perversion 
of God's design. Religion belongs to Him&mdash;creeds are 
the work of men. Your <i>Ave Maria</i>, sir, can make little 
difference to those who lie there. Pray, excuse me, I am 
perhaps over-bold in expressing an opinion."</p>

<p>"Not at all, my friend. The wrestling matches among 
religious disputants have left us, upon many points, in a 
state of embarrassing doubt and confusion, and your idea 
of a universal belief&mdash;a unanimity of creed&mdash;is sublime, 
because, as you say, it seems more in accordance with 
God's design&mdash;more in harmony with perfectness; but I 
am detaining you; my way lies in the opposite direction.
Good-evening."</p>

<p>"Perry," exclaimed Abby, "I wish we hadn't come 

<!-- page 170 -->

this way. What can a man want prowling about a graveyard 
at this hour?"</p>

<p>"He may have some one of his family buried here. He 
may have lost some one whom he loved. I can't think of 
anything more terrible, except to lose faith in one who is 
dear to us&mdash;to know that the woman whom we trusted is 
not acting fairly by us."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about? Who is not acting fair, 
Perry?" she asked.</p>

<p>He caught her hand, and put his finger on the ruby ring&mdash;it 
shone bright and red in the clear starlight.</p>

<p>"Did <i>I</i> give you that?" he said, in a tone of repressed 
anger. "Can a poor fellow like me afford to give his
sweetheart a ring that cost what that did? I know a
real stone when I see it."</p>

<p>"Suppose you do," she answered, flippantly. "I don't
see, because the stone is real, why I couldn't have come by 
it properly; and I don't see what right you have to say anything 
about it, or to make yourself disagreeable because I
have a ruby ring on my finger."</p>

<p>"It's not because you have a ruby ring on your finger,
Abby, that I feel hurt. It is because you are not open 
with me, and that you have put aside my poor little gift to 
wear one far too handsome for a carpenter's wife."</p>

<p>"I'm not <i>that</i> yet," she cried, petulantly.</p>

<p>"Ah! Abby," said the poor fellow, "would you break 
with me for so paltry a matter? Is my love worth so little 

<!-- page 171 -->

that you can cast it off like that? You have given me 
the right to speak plainly to you, and you can satisfy me 
now by a little candor and honesty."</p>

<p>The girl was driven hard; she possessed no very strong 
principle of truth, and her volatile nature at once sought 
the quickest way to extricate herself from her difficulty. 
The temptation was strong upon her, and she yielded.</p>

<p>"Miss Eleanor has always been fond of me," she said; 
it was well that the darkness hid her crimson cheeks, 
"and it's not the first keepsake that she's given me."</p>

<p>"Why did you not say so at once? Ah! Abby, you 
might have spared me so much pain," Perry said, putting 
his arm around her waist. "It wasn't kind, dear. An 
humble man like me is apt to be jealous of his love. I 
won't have another man's eyes taking what's my own."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Perry," she said, with a laugh, "don't you 
be making yourself miserable for nothing."</p>

<p>She raised up her face to him and he kissed her. The 
true, honest heart of the man was grieved at its own injustice. 
He would have humbled himself to the earth before 
this girl whom he loved, and whom he thought he had 
injured by suspicion; and he promised himself&mdash;and at 
that moment he thought that such a thing was possible&mdash;never 
again to think ill of her, and she, with a saucy laugh, 
called him "a dear old fellow."</p>

<p>The vast, radiant world was around them&mdash;the soft, 
delicious night grow brighter and brighter as the moon rose 

<!-- page 172 -->

above the horizon&mdash;nature smiled serenely upon them as 
they walked on towards the glimmering lights that warned 
them of their approach to the Searings. The man would 
have been happy to linger in the cool, fresh solitude with 
his love.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"The moon shines bright: in such a night as this,<br/>

When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees<br/>

And they did make no noise."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The girl was thinking of the pleasure awaiting her&mdash;longing 
to take her place in the dance where she would 
reign queen of the rustic gathering.</p>

<div class="center" id="ch25">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXV.</p>

<p class="small">"THIS NIGHT HE MAKES A SUPPER."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> will enter the rustic gates with Perry and Abby, 
for the lively scene is well calculated to arouse 
a desire to witness the progress of festivities, 
which, though simple in detail, are not lacking in the elements 
of enjoyment. We will accept the hearty invitation 
of Mr. Searing, and mingle with these simple country folk, 
entering into their unrestrained merriment and savoring 
the zest of remarks, which, if lacking in the polish of refinement, 

<!-- page 173 -->

at least carry the weight of sincerity which often 
becomes pointed personality, and elicits, at the expense of 
a deal of good-natured embarrassment, loud shouts of 
laughter which are as exhilarating as champagne. We 
will promise the reader in good time to follow the mysterious 
gentleman, who, in a country burying-ground, where 
most of those who rested there had died in the simple 
faith of the Methodist, was singing a hymn to the Virgin 
with faith as deep as was ever that of holy saint or suffering 
martyr.</p>

<p>The yard was brilliantly illuminated with the light of 
resinous pine-knots, which burned on elevated stands 
covered with earth, and which were replenished from piles 
of the wood placed ready at hand. This duty was performed 
by negroes, whose black faces shone with high 
good humor and enjoyment, for no race is more keenly 
alive to cheerful impression. Give the negro a fiddle or a 
banjo, with a modicum of meat and drink, and he is as 
happy as a king, if the happiness of a king is not a palpable 
paradox.</p>

<p>Mr. Searing's house was constructed upon no particular 
architectural design, everything about it seeming to have 
been a suggestion either of utility or convenience. Two 
large rooms were separated by a spacious hall; and shed-rooms, 
with roof sloping from the main house, afforded 
sleeping accommodation for the younger members of the 
family. A wide piazza ran along the front; and immense 

<!-- page 174 -->

chimneys, composed of rough stones found in the neighboring 
hills, and put together without any attempt at 
regularity of surface, while they suggested the idea of 
warmth and comfort, were neither symmetrical in form 
nor creditable to the skill of the builder. These chimney-places 
were now filled with freshly-gathered pine and cedar 
boughs. Upon the whitewashed walls of the rooms 
wooden sconces were nailed, highly ornamented with cut 
paper and holding tallow candles. Chairs and benches 
were ranged for the accommodation of the elder portion 
of the company, while the well-scoured floors were sanded, 
ready for the dancers. The hall had been cleared of the 
heterogeneous collection of horns, guns, fishing-rods, saddles, 
and other accoutrements which usually hung there.
These had been transferred to the front piazza, perhaps 
for the especial entertainment of the men who had 
collected there, and who seemed so intent upon their 
examination as to be somewhat oblivious of their duty 
towards the girls, who, in Swiss muslin and pink and blue 
and green sash-ribbons, were gathered in clusters about 
the rooms like so many butterflies, waiting the first scrape 
of the violin, to flutter away with their beaux.</p>

<p>One of the shed-rooms had been allotted as a dressing-room 
for the girls. Many of them lived at a distance and 
had brought their dresses with them; so that the spectacle, 
as one after another took possession of the small, 
square Looking-glass, was curious as affording those phases 

<!-- page 175 -->

of human vanity which, perhaps, are never brought out 
more clearly than in woman nature thrown into immediate 
juxtaposition and clashing in rivalry. It was a 
notable fact that the plainest girls kept their place before 
the glass the longest time, and seemed never to grow 
weary of looking at themselves&mdash;arranging their curls&mdash;putting 
on the lily-white&mdash;turning their heads from side 
to side to get a view of the back hair, and appealing to 
every one to tell them whether the flowers were properly
adjusted. And, oh, dear! could they see the powder&mdash;were 
they really sure that they couldn't? Such rustling 
of stiff petticoats&mdash;such creaking of new shoes&mdash;such fluttering 
of ribbons&mdash;such confusion of tongues; and then 
such an avalanche of kisses when Abby came in to lay 
aside her shawl.</p>

<p>"I do declare, Abby, if you haven't got on the very 
dress I was dying to buy&mdash;and made up so stylish; and 
your hair is done up beautiful! La! you've got a new 
ring," said the occupant of the glass.</p>

<p>"Let's see, let's see!" exclaimed a dozen voices.</p>

<p>"A real gold ring; and such a stone! Hold it to the 
light, Susan Moore. Did you ever see a thing glitter so?
I suppose you wouldn't mind telling where you got it," 
said a tall, freckle-faced girl of the piney-wood type;
"them as good-looking as you don't get such things."</p>

<p>"Manners go before good looks, Jane Uzzle, and as
you haven't got one, you might try to pick up the 

<!-- page 176 -->

other," answered Abby, pulling on her ring and leaving 
the room.</p>

<p>"The spiteful, stuck-up thing!" exclaimed Miss Uzzle. 
"If I haven't a mind to tell what I know."</p>

<p>"Tell us, Jane!" exclaimed the girls, "do tell us."</p>

<p>"No, no, I won't have any scandal," said pretty Patty 
Searing, coming into the room. "There goes the music, 
the boys are all waiting; so be off with you."</p>

<p>Sure enough, the fiddles struck up a reel, and the tune 
electrified the tardy damsels; even Miss Uzzle forgot to
be spiteful, and made one "spit curl" less than she had 
intended, in her haste to get "on the floor."</p>

<p>And now the fun commenced in earnest. The long reel 
was formed, all the girls on one side and the men on the 
other. The rustic beaux were smart in stiff shirt-collars 
and gay cravats&mdash;their hair was parted in accurate lines, 
front and back, and oiled, and frizzed in so killing a way 
that it was only a wonder that the girls did not fall in 
love with them then and there. Their shoes were polished 
to the last degree, and their feet went into the first 
position.</p>

<p>"Hands around!" was shouted by the negro fiddler, 
and then away they went around and around, while the 
gay music and the tapping of the musicians' feet beating 
time gave a lively impetus to the gayety. "Down the 
middle!" Here was an opportunity to display grace and 
skill in executing "steps." The lady turned the gentlemen, 

<!-- page 177 -->

and the gentleman turned the ladies, and then they 
turned each other, and thus until they reached the bottom 
of the reel, and then a wild gallopade, and back to places, 
and around again. Was there ever so life-inspiring a 
dance as the Virginia reel? The music grew livelier, the 
rhythm more marked, the fiddlers wagged their heads and 
beat the floor with their feet, while the old people pressed 
forward to see the dancers, applauding whenever some 
extra pigeon wing was cut, or some young lady displayed 
unusual grace and lightness in her movements. Even the 
staid Perry partook of the reigning hilarity, and joined in
the dance with Patty Searing as a partner. And so the 
hours wore on until the supper room was thrown open; 
and then what a rush! how everybody crowded to the table, 
and how they admired the great iced cakes ornamented
with sprigs of cedar&mdash;how the young girls simpered over
whipped cream and custards, and could hardly be prevailed 
upon to take a slice of ham or turkey, while the 
older portion of the company sat down to crisp roast pig, 
and then passed their plates until the turkeys were nothing 
but skeletons, and the chicken pies miniature caverns! 
Cups of steaming coffee were passed from hand to hand, 
and slices of light bread were consumed in quick succession. 
Everybody was satisfied&mdash;the candles were guttering in 
the sockets of the candlesticks&mdash;the fires had gone down 
on the stands, the girls were laughing and chattering, 
while they searched for shawls and bonnets, and the young 

<!-- page 178 -->

men, profiting by their absence, put a quid of tobacco in 
their mouths, or took a draft at a pipe; then the merry 
"good-byes," as some mounted on horseback, in more than 
one instance riding double, while others went away in 
buggies or wagons.</p>

<p>Perry and Abby wore among the last to leave. Abby 
leaned on Perry's arm a little more tenderly, perhaps, as 
a sort of compensation to him for the great amount of 
flirting which she had done that night. They reached 
home just as the cock in the barn-yard heralded the dawn, 
and when they parted at the foot of the stairs, Perry took 
Abby in his arms and kissed her. "Trust me, Abby," 
he said, "to love you as well as man ever loved woman."</p>

<p>She cried a little as she took off her pink dress, and 
made a remorseful catalogue of her shortcomings, intending, 
before she went to sleep, to say her prayers, with an 
idea which was a faint and undefined yearning growing 
out of human necessity for higher aid, that it was the 
right thing to do when people are feeling not exactly 
happy. Abby was very tired and forgot the prayers. She 
fell asleep to dream that she was being married to Gaston 
de Rousy, in a white satin dress, with ruby rings on all of 
her fingers.</p>

<div class="center" id="ch26">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXVI.</p>

<p class="small">"RICH ONLY TO BE WRETCHED."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> stranger, who was no other than James 
Pultney, after parting from Abby and Perry, 
turned into a forest path leading down to the 
creek which supplied Searing's mill. He crossed the rude 
bridge, scarcely heeding the swift, dark water rushing forward 
beneath the black shadows of overhanging branches, 
to tumble in mimic uproar over the dam, the feathery 
spray silvering in the white moon-rays. Across the 
creek the path grow wider and finally emerged into a solitary 
and unfrequented road leading to a house so densely 
shaded that it was scarcely visible to those who might 
chance to pass that way.</p>

<p>The gate was surmounted by stone lions; but the ivy 
had woven fantastic wreaths around the formidable monsters, 
binding their sharp claws and hiding their hideous 
fangs beneath its glossy leaves. No sign of life came from 
out of the deep shadow that rested on the ruinous house. 
After several efforts, Mr. Pultney succeeded in opening
the rusty iron gate. It clanged behind him, awaking 
strange echoes from out of the dreary solitude. The 

<!-- page 180 -->

avenue leading to the house was overgrown with rank,
tangled weeds. A damp odor of decay rose up from the 
earth&mdash;from out of the dense and luxuriant growth the 
perfume of woodbine and cape jessamine mingled with the 
rich breath of the oleander. It was a wilderness of shrubs 
and flowers, through which the moon-rays scarcely penetrated, 
and where snakes and lizards shared, with the
loathsome toad, an undisturbed security. Overturned 
vases, green with mould, lay beside the dry basin of a 
fountain, now half filled with earth, which nourished the 
poisonous vine that embraced with its interlacing tendrils 
the forlorn marble swan, whose open mouth and dilated 
eyes seemed to appeal, with touching despair, to the profound
solitude which reigned supreme over this desolate 
spot. The house, solidly built of brick, had evidently 
been the residence of a gentleman; but years of abandonment 
and neglect had done their work upon the more perishable
parts of the structure. Some of the shutters had 
fallen away, while others hung by one hinge, ready to join 
their companions in the mouldy dampness below. The
mortar had, in many places, dropped from between the 
bricks, and the crevices were filled with moss and lichens, 
that fed upon the moisture and mildew which clung to the
walls.</p>

<p>Mr. Pultney passed around the house and entered it, 
through the back door. The hall was wide and lofty, and 
doors of oak opened from the apartments on both sides.

<!-- page 181 -->

He turned the lock of one on the right, and entered a
room which bore a striking contrast with the ruin and 
mouldiness of the rest of the mansion. A thick carpet 
covered the floor, paintings hung on the walls, books were 
everywhere, in the book-cases, on the tables, and even on 
chairs and sofas&mdash;just where the reader happened to have 
been sitting while reading. A parlor organ stood between 
the high windows, and treasures of music in richly bound 
folios were piled beside it. A lamp burned on the table 
in the centre of the room, which held writing materials 
and sheets of manuscript. Mr. Pultney threw open the
window and stood looking out on the garden, where the 
moonlight was making weird shadows and the night-birds 
were flapping their dusky wings, as they reeled through 
the air. His face, white and worn, bore the marks of that 
travail of the soul which furrows cheek and brow into 
premature age; but it was touchingly interesting in its 
serene melancholy, and dignified in the lofty nobility of 
its expression. His reverie was interrupted by the entrance 
of a woman, wearing the stiff, white muslin cap 
peculiar to the French <i>bonne</i>. Her dark eyes were small 
and bright; her complexion brown, with a healthy tinge
on the cheek, and her teeth very white and regular. The
hair, which showed from beneath her cap, was streaked 
with gray, and the lines about the mouth and forehead
were strongly defined. Her manner was confident and 
slightly patronizing to her master; just as an earnest 

<!-- page 182 -->

practical nature will domineer over one which is vacillating 
in purpose. She had long held the post of sole servant 
to him, and managed as she pleased the simple details 
of his <i>m&eacute;nage</i>.</p>

<p>"Ah! Mr. Pultney," she said, "come away from that 
window. There's nothing but ruin and decay to look 
upon. I have brought you your tea in the majolica cup, 
and here are the biscuits that you like."</p> 

<p>"My good Ursule," he answered, "how did you know 
that I prefer drinking out of the majolica cup?"</p>

<p>"How do I know what music to place uppermost ready 
at your hand, but that, for all these years that I have 
served you, I have learned to read your wants and to 
know what most pleases you?"</p>

<p>He smiled&mdash;a smile that illumined his face with its 
radiance, lending to it a beauty caught from the flashes 
of inspiration which come with the gifts of genius&mdash;a 
beauty linked to goodness&mdash;inseparable from singleness 
of heart.</p>

<p>"<i>Bon Dieu!</i>" exclaimed the woman, clasping her hands 
and looking curiously at him, "one would say that you 
had been with the angels to-night, out there in the gloomy 
forest."</p> 

<p>"I have been to my mother's grave&mdash;doubtless her pure 
spirit was with me. At any rate, my own soul felt that 
communion with hers which convinces me of its spirituality. 
Ah! man is great even in the knowledge of his 

<!-- page 183 -->

own misery. He may be crushed by it; but he rises up 
immortal!"</p>

<p>"<i>Bon Dieu!</i> hear him now! I do not understand; 
and yet I know that his words are grand and beautiful;"
thus murmured Ursule, as she set his tea on a small table 
before him. "Drink now, while it is hot, and I will tell
you of the visitors who came here to-day."</p>

<p>"Visitors!" exclaimed Mr. Pultney. "Ursule, have I 
not warned you that I will not have my privacy broken 
upon?"</p>

<p>"Listen," she answered; "they came from the forest 
on the other side"&mdash;pointing in the direction of Worleigh&mdash;"a 
beautiful demoiselle and an old gentleman. I was 
washing near the spring-house where the water runs from 
the old stone trough into the pool. I heard the tramp of 
horses and then saw them coming. There are no fences 
to keep out intruders, and they rode straight to the spring.
You may imagine how surprised they were at seeing me.
The gentleman might have been her father; but I saw no 
resemblance between them. He excused himself for having 
trespassed on the privacy of the grounds, and said that 
for so many years it had been abandoned that now it was 
looked upon almost as common property. I told him that 
my master had lately settled here&mdash;that he came from 
abroad, and that I had left my country to follow him&mdash;that 
he never saw visitors, and seldom went beyond the 
grounds. Was I right, eh? They asked no questions, 

<!-- page 184 -->

and while I handed to the <i>demoiselle</i> the gourd of water 
for which she had asked me, I looked at her beautiful 
young face, and I was sorry when she rode away, 
smiling her thanks, and I thought that had never seen 
so graceful a figure, or a riding-habit that fitted so perfectly."</p>

<p>"You are not apt to grow enthusiastic, Ursule, over 
strangers. This young girl must be fair indeed."</p>

<p>"As fair," she answered, "as the lily there, in the 
hand of Our Blessed Mother"&mdash;pointing to Overbeck's 
"Virgin with the Lily." "Her eyes are dark and soft, 
and the long curls of her hair that fell on her shoulders 
have that golden sheen which the old painters gave to the 
angels."</p>

<p>She spoke in French; and from close intercourse with 
her master and a ready faculty of imitation, she had 
acquired a manner of expression unusual in one of her 
station. Her ideas were taken, in a great measure, from 
the objects by which, for so many years, she had been 
surrounded. Dusting Madonnas and Angels, Bacchantes 
and Fauns; handling the treasures of art, which her 
master had collected, she had become familiar with them 
as household furniture. She knew the <i>genre</i> pictures of 
Breughel and Teniers&mdash;the exquisite pastorals of Cuyp&mdash;the 
charming heads of Greuze, and she was never surprised 
when called from her kitchen to admire a rare miniature&mdash;a 
piece of old carving, or an engraving. She did 

<!-- page 185 -->

not always understand why she should admire them; or 
comprehend her master's enthusiasm; but she listened 
all the same, and grew to love the treasures committed 
to her care.</p>

Ursule had taken away the majolica cup and closed the 
door. After sitting for a few moments wrapt in thought, 
Mr. Pultney lighted a cigar and walked through the glass 
door into the desolate garden. He paced to and fro, the 
tangled grass, wet with the heavy dew, hampering his feet, 
and the white moonlight flickering on the wild luxuriance 
of trailing rose-vines interwoven with clematis and wisteria&mdash;with 
honeysuckle and the rosy trumpets of bignonia 
bearing down with their weight the half fallen 
arbors. Beyond, the pines, tall and sombre, moaned their 
eternal dirge. It came like sullen waves of sound surging 
through the forest, swelling into full cadence, then 
dying away in lingering echo. The place was weird and
melancholy, and every nook and corner of the old garden 
was associated with memories dear to Mr. Pultney's heart. 
Ursule's song had ceased in the kitchen, the frogs croaked 
from the damp, dark places around the old spring-house, 
and the night was growing chill as, at last, he entered the 
house.</p>

<p>From an old <i>escritoire</i> he took out a diary which was 
secured under a lock, and, seating himself by the table,
he opened it, turning page after page until he reached 
nearly the middle of the book, where the writing was 

<!-- page 186 -->

closer and the substance something more than a mere 
record of events. On page fifty-six was written, at the 
beginning of the first line, "Frances, August 23d."</p>

<div class="center" id="ch27">

<p>CHAPTER XXVII.</p>

<p class="small">"I FIND NOT MYSELF DISPOSED TO SLEEP."</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Frances</span>, August 23d. She is here&mdash;Frances 
has come. Have I done fairly by my mother 
in thus deceiving her? No, I am perfectly 
aware of the leading motive of my mind&mdash;perfectly aware 
that I am giving way to a weak indulgence of my passion.
I do not even question my conscience, or attempt to justify 
my conduct. No casuistry can convince me that I 
have acted wisely or prudently in bringing Frances here;
but I love her, and, with dauntless heart and scheming 
brain, I will work to accomplish my end.</p>

<p>"How admirably she played her part this morning, saluting 
my mother in a manner so perfectly in keeping with 
her dependent position and, seemingly, so absorbed in her 
attendance on my sister Grace that she did not notice my 
presence, until I was formally presented to her and yet 

<!-- page 187 -->

she managed, with one glance, to set my heart beating 
and to intoxicate me with the joy which fills my soul 
whenever I am in her presence.</p>

<p>"To-day, for one moment, we met in the hall&mdash;a pressure 
of the hand&mdash;a glance from her deep, luminous eyes, and 
she was gone. I went into the library and sat for hours, 
living off of that look&mdash;dreaming away the time, until my 
father's voice aroused me, and I saw him standing in the 
door, his riding-whip in hand and a bitter smile curling 
his lip.</p>

<p>" 'I congratulate you, sir,' he said. 'A young man is 
fortunate indeed, when he possesses a temperament so
peculiarly fitted to the enjoyment of ease and idleness. It 
is happy for you, sir, that at the outset of life you are
not called upon to exert yourself to obtain your daily 
bread. You have familiarized yourself with luxury until 
you quite forget to whom you owe the means of its 
indulgence.'</p>

<p>"Stung to the quick, I rose to my feet and answered 
hotly: 'There is no danger, sir, of my forgetting what 
I owe to <i>your</i> bounty. You have given me the education 
of a gentleman; far better would it have been had you 
apprenticed me to a carpenter or shoemaker. Then, at 
least, I would have had a means of earning my daily 
bread.'</p>

<p>" 'Your speech is as absurd as your conduct,' he said, 
with galling contempt. 'You are your mother's own son, 

<!-- page 188 -->

and likely to be as useless in all practical matters as she 
is.'</p>

<p>"He turned and walked away, as he had done many 
times before, leaving me a prey to that futile exasperation
which spent itself in cursing my destiny and wishing that 
I had been born with a nature which might have been 
shaped and moulded to his own ideas, instead of the 
sensitive imaginative temperament, rendered antagonistic 
to his by hereditary predispositions, which totally unfit 
me for the career that he has chosen for me.</p>

<p>"I went to my mother, and poured my complaint into 
her willing ear. I am always sure to find the solace of 
sympathy with her."</p>

<p>Here he turned over several pages, his eye passing 
carelessly over them, until it rested on the date of 
September 25th.</p>

<p>"She has the tact and knowledge of a woman of the 
world, and yet Frances is only nineteen years old! My 
father evidently admires her, while she thoroughly understands 
him. It will be no very difficult matter for Frances 
to obtain an influence over him, which will result in a 
voluntary concession, from habit, of those arbitrary ideas 
which he entertains with regard to my future prospects.
The propellors to the motive of his thoughts and the 
choice of his actions are commonplace enough. Frances 
divined them at once.</p>

<p>"I am tantalized beyond endurance! My life is spent 

<!-- page 189 -->

in agonies of jealousy, in ecstasies of joy and repentance, 
when I can snatch her to my heart for a moment and 
press my lips to hers.</p>

<p>"Oct. 3d.&mdash;It is decided that I am to go to the law 
school, I have but one thought, and that is, that I am to 
be separated from Frances. I have suggested to her a 
dozen wild and imprudent alternatives to avoid going; but 
her clear and decided refusal to listen to me has overcome
my purpose of attempting to resist my father's will.</p>

<p>" 'Do you pretend to love me, Oscar,' she said to me 
this morning, 'and show yourself thus unwilling to make 
the sacrifice of your inclination to my good?'</p> 

<p>"Her speech stung into life my consciousness of what 
I owed to her. I am going, but I take no heart in the 
work before me."</p>

<p>Here he turned page after page&mdash;his face grew paler&mdash;his 
fingers twitched convulsively, and he paused at a date 
one year later.</p>

<p>"I have married Frances! My father seems to be 
laboring under a strange infatuation. His contempt for 
me seems to increase daily, and he takes little trouble to 
conceal it. Sometimes I think&mdash;oh, horrible thought!
that his ready consent to my marriage was given as an 
alternative between the sacrifice of his ambitious plans for 
his only son and his separation from Frances. She rules 
the household. Happily for my poor mother, she is far 
too ailing to feel keenly the mortification of my father's 

<!-- page 190 -->

neglect of her. Oh, the misery of an awakening such as 
mine! Frances does not love me. I know it now.</p>

<p>"My father, essentially a close and prudent man, is 
growing alarmed at her extravagance. Like all women 
who, having been brought up within the limits of poverty 
and under its hard restrictions, find themselves suddenly 
in possession of an ample purse, she gives unbridled liberty
to her luxurious tastes. Nothing seems too rich&mdash;nothing 
too costly for her. I hear projects of journeying to the 
gay capitals of Europe, where she may display her personal 
charms and accomplishments.</p>

<p>"I dare not tell my mother of my misery, still less
would I acquaint her with the real history of Frances&mdash;that 
is, where and how I found her."</p>

<p>Then followed mere jottings down from time to time&mdash;no 
regular dates until March 24h.</p>

<p>"To-day my mother was buried&mdash;the sorrows of her life 
are over. She is at rest. Can I find consolation in this&mdash;can 
I accustom myself to the thought of her absence&mdash;will 
God forgive the angry grief which rages in my heart? My 
love for my mother was a sacred, beautiful religion. All 
the good in me is traceable to her influence and to her
guidance. She has cheered my energies&mdash;she has stimulated 
my flagging spirit. She knew my fatal weakness&mdash;my 
utter inability to battle against the tide which is overwhelming 
me."</p>

<p>The worn, thin face grew beautiful in expression as he 

<!-- page 191 -->

raised it from the diary to look at a portrait which hung
on the opposite wall. The wrapt devotion might have 
eradiated from the face of a worshipper before the shrine 
of his favorite saint. The poor, trembling fingers turned 
the pages mechanically; he seemed to be pursuing some 
train of thought which diverted him from his immediate 
purpose, when, by that strange fatality which we call accident, 
his eye fell upon the date of September 12th. In 
a moment he was brought back to the sense of misery 
which this retrospection had conjured out of the past.</p>

<p>"Midnight.&mdash;A child is born&mdash;a girl. How lovely 
Frances looked in her pallor&mdash;how softly her dark eyes 
turned upon the tiny babe which lay at her side.</p>

<p>" 'Oscar,' she said, in a tone so sweet and low that my 
foolish heart gave a great throb of joy, 'you will wish 
to call her Catherine after your mother.'</p> 

<p>"I stooped over her, all my old tenderness returning&mdash;all 
the past forgotten&mdash;I kissed her and whispered, 'Thank 
you, Frances; thank you, my darling! How happy you 
have made me to-night!'</p>

<p>"Poor, foolish, trusting heart! How soon has your joy 
died out&mdash;how can I transform the cruel agony of your
grief into language?"</p>

<p>Baden, July 21st, was the next date.</p>

<p>"Frances has lost immensely. She has played with the 
recklessness which characterizes all her actions. My 
father is furious at the loss of his money; and he has 

<!-- page 192 -->

peremptorily ordered her to make ready for immediate 
departure.</p>

<p>"At sea, August 16th.&mdash;Nothing around me but the 
wide reach of water&mdash;the eternal motion of the restless 
waves&mdash;nothing in my heart but despair and bitter shame.
I am fleeing from the horror of my life&mdash;I am putting 
miles of ocean between me and the false, fair wife, who 
has cruelly wrenched from me the only comfort of my 
desolate life&mdash;my child&mdash;my little Catherine."</p>

<p>He closed the book; the story of his life was told. He 
sat now in the old abandoned house, master of its ruin&mdash;master 
too of wealth accumulated in foreign lands. His 
father's taunts at parting had aroused in him a new energy 
and stimulated his dormant faculties. Success had 
saved him from discouragement, but not from the consequences 
of overwork and harrowing anxiety with regard 
to the fate of his child. He valued his wealth only 
as a means of discovering her and bestowing upon her the 
comforts and luxuries which it pleased him to think that 
she would worthily use. He had hitherto been strangely 
misled in his inquiries; and only after several years of 
sojourn in France, did he determine to return to the old
place under an assumed name and prosecute the search in 
person. He had heard from strange lips of his father's 
death&mdash;he had heard him stigmatized as a grovelling miser, 
who had died unloved and unmourned; but he made no 
effort to secure the fortune which was his own.</p>

<!-- page 193 -->

<p>He was of a shy, timid nature, delicately sensitive of 
appearing intrusive, and his meeting with Kitty had satisfied 
him that to accost young ladies during their walks 
was probably not the proper way to undertake his task. 
His wanderings about the country had been productive of 
little satisfaction; but his visit to Blackwell's and Ursule's 
description of the "beautiful <i>demoiselle</i>" had excited him 
to fresh hope, and he determined once again to seek Dr. 
Maribel and learn from him the truth with regard to the 
child whom he had protected. Grace, the little sister to 
whom Frances had been governess, was sent, after her 
mother's death, to a distant boarding-school where she had 
died; and thus Oscar Featherstone had found himself 
bereft in early life of those chances of happiness which 
belong to family relations.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXVIII.</p>

<p class="small">"TO WHAT ISSUE WILL THIS COME?"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Agatha Wilbraham</span> held an open letter in 
her hand. It was from her husband. The
warm affection breathed through every line, the 
solicitude manifested for her pleasure and comfort, were 
like so many words of burning reproach. She had gone 
to her own room to read it, shunning the possibility of 
encountering the sharp, questioning looks of De Rousy,
which were obviously significant of a watchful suspicion, 
aroused by the fear that the better part of Agatha's nature&mdash;which 
had been prominently brought forward by 
influences hitherto unexperienced, and therefore to be 
guarded against&mdash;might impel her to a course of conduct 
which would endanger the success of his plans. 
He knew that the task which she had set herself was 
becoming each day more difficult, and that she contemplated 
its fulfilment with strong repugnance. Agatha, 
on her part, knew that the man with whom she had to 
deal was as unscrupulous as he was exacting, and that he 
would hold her to the compact which she had made with 
him. In obedience to his wishes, she had invited Kitty 

<!-- page 195 -->

to Worleigh. His subtle reasoning had overcome her 
prudence, but it could not quell the apprehension which 
chilled her heart and quickened her conscience into remorseful 
agony. That very day she had seen Kitty riding 
on horseback, accompanied by Colonel Covington. It was 
her habit to take a daily drive, more to break into the 
wearisome monotony of her life than from any enjoyment 
which she found. Indeed, she seldom cared for</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Nature's sweet voices, always full of love and joyance,"</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>and she sat looking absently out on the objects which 
they passed, her thoughts far away in other scenes, dwelling 
on memories which sometimes brought a flush of triumph 
to her cheek, or often a look of deep dejection which 
paled them into the wanness of melancholy.</p>

<p>"Wilkins, whither does that road lead?" she asked of 
the coachman, indicating with her finger the direction 
taken by Colonel Covington and Kitty.</p>

"Dat road, mistess, takes you by Searing's mill, an'
after you cross de creek you can go on to Mapleton, or 
turn to de left and go to de ole place; but de road ain't 
been worked on I dunno when, and it's becase nobody is
gwine to pass dere, ef dey can help it."</p>

<p>"Well, I have a notion to go there, Wilkins."</p>

<p>Anything which promised variety was enticing to her;
she was bored to death at Worleigh.</p>

<p>The road was in so bad a condition that she determined 

<!-- page 196 -->

to walk, leaving Wilkins to wait for her. Walking along 
the rough road, her silken skirt brushing the dust from the 
golden-rods that bordered it, her small feet leaving their 
slender tracks in the sand, she came to the iron gates that 
shut in the desolate house. A blank dismay was on her 
face, as she clutched the iron to prevent herself from falling. 
The wild, scared eyes looked up at the old building, 
standing in the deep shadow of the huge oak boughs that 
swayed above its roof. She stood with the warm sunshine
glistening on the sheen of her silk&mdash;with the hum of bees 
and the twitter of the sparrows in the hedges&mdash;with the 
trailing trumpet-vine showering its red blossoms at her feet, 
and the stone lions looking down grimly upon her. She 
was gazing at this ruin and desolation, with the awful consciousness 
that she had caused it all.</p>

<p>The history of the Featherstones had almost died out of 
the memory of people; the old house had stood untenanted 
for so many years that its existence was scarcely known; 
the road leading to it was untravelled, and its neighborhood 
avoided by the superstitions. According to old 
Mr. Featherstone's directions, when he went away, a 
negro man and his wife had been settled on the place, with 
the privilege of cultivating land sufficient to supply their 
wants, and they were left in charge of the house and furniture. 
Agatha had never dreamed that the old place was 
so near to Worleigh. She had lived there but a short 
time, so many long years ago, and then she had gone so 

<!-- page 197 -->

seldom from the place that she knew little of the neighborhood. 
The family had slight intercourse with their 
neighbors. Mrs. Featherstone's health was delicate, and 
Mr. Featherstone was wanting in those social qualities 
which encourage hospitality; so that Agatha's surprise at 
finding herself at the gates of her old home was as genuine 
as it was painful.</p>

<p>"God help me!" she moaned, as she staggered away, 
her long robe trailing in the dust, her teeth set into her
nether lip to keep back a cry of agony. Her overpowering
emotion had mastered the little strength which she 
possessed, and she sank to the earth, sheltered by a group 
of cedars. Not too soon for concealment; for Col. Covington 
and Kitty rode by, and she heard Kitty say, in 
her sweet, tender voice:</p> 

<p>"She must have been a wicked woman, this Frances 
Featherstone, to have abandoned so good and noble a 
man; and how cruel in her to have taken away the 
child!"</p>

<p>The thud of the horses' feet grew fainter and fainter; 
she was left there in her horrible misery grovelling on the
ground&mdash;her heart bleeding, under the mockery of her 
costly lace.</p>

<p>An hour later she went back to the carriage and told
Wilkins to drive quickly homeward, for her head ached&mdash;the 
sun was so very hot.</p>

<p>Wilkins was heard to tell the cook, on that very evening, 

<!-- page 198 -->

that he believed more than ever in the ghost. He 
doubtless had good cause for this accession of faith.</p>

<p>Agatha crushed her husband's letter in her hand as 
she went out on the piazza. It was late and the household 
had retired. As she paced to and fro, the power of 
her strong will gradually overcame the tumult of her feeling. 
She was perhaps involuntarily drawn into sympathy 
with the peaceful night, for she was gradually weaned
from the consciousness of her own troubled life and the 
despotic influences which controlled it. Her highly 
wrought poetic temperament possessed the faculty, peculiar 
to such natures, of rising above the absolute and of 
drawing from sources wholly imaginative a sweet and 
dangerous pleasure. Many and many times before had 
she anchored near the flowery isle and listened to the 
alluring voices. With a sudden impulse she re-entered 
her room, and going softly down the stairs, she passed 
through the hall to an apartment on the left. This was 
the library. A light was burning there, and Gaston de
Rousy sat lolling comfortably in a luxurious chair, beside 
the open window.</p>

<p>"Gaston," said Agatha, "pray close the window. I 
must speak to you, and I would not be overheard."</p>

<p>He drew down the sash, and coming to her, said: 
"Something has occurred to disturb you."</p>

<p>"You know that I had a letter from Wilbraham this 
morning. He is coming home."</p>

<!-- page 199 -->

<p>"Coming home! when?" said De Rousy, with face a 
shade paler.</p>

<p>"In a month or six weeks at farthest; and I have 
come here to-night, Gaston, to insist upon your giving up 
all thought of Kitty."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> have come to insist upon my giving up all 
thought of Kitty!" He repeated the words, slowly emphasizing 
each one and looking at her with his glittering 
eyes, so like a serpent's. "From what source have you 
drawn your courage, madame? Have you put on an 
armor of heroism, and are you ready to embrace poverty, 
shame, and ignominy&mdash;are you ready to go back to the old 
life where I found you&mdash;are you willing to be separated 
from your child, and to leave her, as sole inheritance from 
you, the history of your life?"</p>

<p>"Fool that I was," she exclaimed, "to suppose that <i>you</i>
could be merciful. Oh, Gaston! remember that I had 
not seen her when I made my fatal promise to you. Is it 
not enough that I have deceived a noble, trusting man&mdash;not 
enough that I have drawn from his generosity to 
supply you with those sums which you have used in 
lavish expenditure&mdash;not enough that hitherto I have been 
your obedient slave, that you now ask of me a sacrifice so
terrible?"</p>

<p>"Agatha," he answered, in a hard, sardonic tone, "you 
have not forgotten the tricks of your profession; and 
your hot Italian blood is driving you now to the extreme 

<!-- page 200 -->

of <i>dramatic</i> madness. Remember, I have seen you in such 
a <i>r&ocirc;le</i>. To you, madame, repentance means ruin. I beseech 
you, save it for your death-bed. A word from me
will send you a beggar from this house. This would indeed 
be a sad catastrophe, as you can no longer rely upon 
those charms which once served you well. You and I, 
Agatha, have no tender memories to full back upon. Our 
acquaintance was made over the roulette table, and it has 
continued to this time merely because our interest is a 
common one. Your position is seriously critical; think 
well of it. It will be better for you and for Miss Pitkin, 
if you throw no obstacle in the way of our marriage. I 
repeat, that it will be better for Miss Pitkin."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you," she said, looking inquiringly 
into his face.</p>

<p>"I do not mean that you shall;" he answered, "but 
you will do well to give that importance to my warning, 
which, I assure you, it deserves."</p>

<p>She went back to her room; and opening her dressing-case, 
took from it a vial containing a dark liquid, and 
pouring a few drops into a glass, she swallowed them.
Of late she had resorted to this desperate and dangerous 
means of obtaining sleep.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIX.</p>

<p class="small">"COME, KNOCK, AND ENTER."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> week following Mr. Pitkin's death, Kitty had 
spent with Mrs. Parrott; but John Maribel 
noticed that she was drooping and out of spirits, 
so he proposed a visit to Col. and Mrs. Covington.
Young natures need the sunshine of warm, genial hearts 
to blossom and expand into beauty; and a week spent at 
Oaklands had been conducive to all the good results 
which John Maribel had hoped for. Col. Covington declared 
that Kitty had charmed away the monotony of 
country life; and she in turn, expressed a wish to prolong 
her visit. The intercourse between Worleigh and Oaklands 
became more frequent. Kitty spent long days with
Mrs. Wilbraham, who exerted her varied accomplishments 
and the fascination of a manner delicately tender, yet 
never overstepping that formality which Agatha had prescribed 
to herself as the only safeguard against the betrayal 
of that maternal love which yearned so ardently for expression. 
Gaston de Rousy was never absent from Worleigh 
during Kitty's visits.</p>

<p>Untutored in the arts of society&mdash;essentially trusting 

<!-- page 202 -->

in her estimate of him, which was based upon her knowledge 
of John Maribel's character&mdash;the only other young 
man of good social position whom she knew intimately&mdash;it 
was no wonder that Kitty was easily deceived by De 
Rousy's arts, and grew to like him, and to experience that 
consciousness of pleasure in his presence which he was 
quick to detect.</p>

<p>Once or twice a week John Maribel spent a few hours 
at Oaklands. He was there when Col. Covington and 
Kitty returned from their ride. After lifting her from the 
saddle, he held her hand&mdash;just as in the old days&mdash;and 
they went up the steps together.</p>

<p>"Have you been long here, John?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It would be very ungallant to Mrs. Covington for me
to say how long the time seemed while waiting for your 
appearance; but" [taking out his watch] "I have in 
reality been here just an hour and ten minutes."</p>

<p>"If I had only known that you were coming, I might 
have put off my ride, but then I would have missed a delightful 
adventure."</p>

<p>"An adventure, Kitty! Why, they seem to be waiting
for you everywhere. Is it an Enoch Arden this time, 
looking for the home where 'Annie lived and loved 
him?' "</p>

<p>"No such lugubrious personage, I declare!" she exclaimed, 
laughing; "but a woman in a short, blue petticoat, 
wearing a white muslin cap, with a fluted frill surrounding 

<!-- page 203 -->

her healthy, good-natured face. The strangest 
part of it all is that she is a Frenchwoman, and she speaks 
English very imperfectly. She was washing in a pool 
beside an old spring-house, where the water fell from a 
stone trough, and the trees formed a shade so thick that 
the sun scarcely penetrated to us. Her master&mdash;as she 
calls Mr. Pultney&mdash;the gentleman who has chosen the 
desolate place for a residence, has lately come from abroad. 
He never receives visits, and goes but seldom beyond 
the grounds. I am dying to know who he is, and why he 
has come here."</p>

<p>"And so am I, Kitty," answered John. "It is all very 
much out of the common way of things, and, unless the 
man is crazy, he must have an object in coming to live in 
a place which is scarcely habitable."</p>

<p>John Maribel spoke lightly, but when Kitty ran up the 
stairs to take off her riding-habit, his face assumed a perturbed, 
anxious look, and he passed his fingers through 
his hair&mdash;a sure sign with him of perplexity of thought. 
He knew nothing of Kitty's parentage; it was clearly his 
duty to follow any clue which would lead to a solution of 
a mystery which could but prove a serious disadvantage 
to her. Who was this strange man who had come to the 
old Featherstone place? Had chance made him a dweller 
within its crumbling walls, or had some powerful motive
drawn him thither? John inclined to the latter opinion. 
By a natural succession of ideas, he connected the stranger 

<!-- page 204 -->

with the Featherstone family; and was it not also natural 
to suppose that Kitty was of their blood?</p>

<p>With the opulent attributes of a noble and generous 
nature, John Maribel at once put aside those considerations 
which would have actuated a less unselfish man.
There was a certain peril to himself connected with the 
discovery of wealth and position for Kitty, but he had no 
thought of avoiding a duty which each moment grew 
clearer and more imperative. He might lose Kitty, but
he would never lose his own self-respect; when they were 
wanted he knew how to bring the strong points of his 
character to his aid. He determined to go that very 
afternoon to seek an interview with Mr. Pultney. He set 
out accordingly after dinner, and as he passed through the 
gate he perceived Gaston de Rousy approaching on horseback. 
He sat on his horse with admirable grace, and 
drew rein, holding out his hand to Dr. Maribel, and 
greeting him with a show of cordiality which their acquaintance 
scarcely warranted.</p>

<p>"How are you, my good Doctor. I hope no one is sick 
at Oaklands."</p>

<p>"I permit myself, now and then, the privilege of making 
an unprofessional visit," answered John.</p>

<p>"And you come to Oaklands?" said De Rousy; "ah, 
Doctor! I can well understand your fatherly regard for 
Miss Pitkin. She really feels for you the utmost love 
and respect," and De Rousy waved to him a graceful "<i>au 

<!-- page 205 -->

revoir</i>," putting at the same time a safe distance between 
himself and the thoroughly provoked physician. John 
Maribel's face still bore traces of decided ill-humor, as he 
turned into a path which diverged from the main road
and led by a nearer way to the Featherstone place. He 
hesitated for a moment to cross the bridge so evidently 
out of repair, and while so doing, he saw Perry approaching 
from the other side. There was a drooping dejection 
about his whole presence; even his usually scrupulously
neat attire was evidently neglected, if not slovenly.</p>

<p>"I am right glad to see you, Doctor," he said, shaking 
hands; but his manner was reserved, and he turned his 
eyes quickly from John's somewhat inquiring look.</p>

<p>"Why haven't you been to town lately, Perry? I expected 
you last Saturday."</p>

<p>"Oh! I've been pretty busy fixing up Mr. Blackwell's
barn, and I couldn't well get away."</p>

<p>John Maribel saw very clearly that there was something 
wrong; but he was not a man to force another's 
confidence; and Perry had often baffled his attempts at 
an intimate knowledge of his affairs, and equally repressed 
his desire to benefit him. It was hard for him to 
confine the light and warmth of his kind heart where its 
sympathy was needed; so he held out his hand to Perry,
saying:</p>

<p>"Dean, you know where to find a friend when you 
want one. Good-by, old fellow."</p>

<!-- page 206 -->

<p>He had a very short way to go before came to those 
old iron gates which shut in the Featherstone mansion.
Fastening his horse to the rusty railing, he pushed them 
open. A mottled snake crossed his path, and the chill 
of dampness struck him as he walked under the dense
shadows of the oaks. The old brass knocker, green with 
verdigris, resounded through the empty hall, the sound 
reaching Ursule in the kitchen, where she was busy with 
her master's dainty linen.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i> but this is a ghostly place!" she cried, 
"that one should be so startled by a knock at the front 
door."</p>

<p>She put her iron on the glowing charcoal, and went 
to answer the knock.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Pultney at home?" asked John Maribel, half
stifled with the dust and lime which fell when the heavy 
door was opened.</p>

<p>"<i>Mille pardons!</i> monsieur," exclaimed Ursule; "nothing 
but dust and ruin in this old house. Ah! that I am 
sorry. I will get you one glass of water&mdash;you suffocate."</p>

<p>"No, no!" answered John, coughing and wiping his 
eyes. "Pray, have the kindness to inform Mr. Pultney 
that Dr. Maribel has called on very important business."</p>

<p>"I am varee sorry, but Mr. Pultney is not at home."</p>

<p>"Do you know when he will return?"</p>

<p>"I cannot answer, monsieur."</p>

<p>It is a notable fact that resolutions made in moments 

<!-- page 207 -->

of highest moral fortitude do not always secure their object. 
John Maribel was in his heart relieved that the 
evil hour was postponed. He was thinking always of 
the gulf which would separate him from Kitty should she 
prove to be the heiress to the Featherstone estate.</p>

<p>He was glad to get away from the lonely place&mdash;to ride 
out once again into light and sunshine. Far off, the sun-rays 
rested on the hills, wooded with oaks and chestnuts, 
their foliage hanging transparent beneath the light. The 
full-uddered cows treaded lazily the homeward path; a 
thousand voices mingled in the air; a thousand wings 
fluttered from bush to tree; the western sky was all 
aglow with evanescent gradations of tint, and as John 
Maribel crossed the creek, he heard Patty Searing's voice
telling him in a clear, high soprano, that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"If a body meet a body coming through the rye,<br/>

If a body kiss a body, need a body cry?"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"I am sure," thought John, "if your lips are as sweet 
as your voice, Patty Searing, nobody could be blamed for 
tasting of them."</p>

<p>He had a long road before him, and carried an anxious 
heart; but Patty's song cheered him on his way, and then 
the stars came out to keep him company, and the voices 
of the night whispered in his ear their mysterious words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Henceforth he should know<br/>

That nature ne'er deserts the wise and pure."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXX.</p>

<p class="small">"GIVE ME ADVANTAGE OF SOME BRIEF DISCOURSE."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">James Pultney</span> rang the bell at Dr. Maribel's 
gate. His appearance certainly justified in 
a measure Nellie Shea's prompt conclusions as 
to the proper course to pursue towards one whose dust-coated 
garments, slouch hat, and drooping figure strongly 
suggested to her a possible solicitor for charity. She 
opened the gate with that defiant manner which servants
naturally assume towards shabbiness, saying to the astonished 
gentleman, as she drew down her sleeves over her 
red arms:</p>

<p>"And it will be long that you'll wait if you've come 
asking for money to send Bibles to the Comanches and 
such like heathen."</p>

<p>"Pray, my good woman, what is there in my appearance 
to suggest to your mind that I am solicitous for the 
conversion of Comanches? Here is my card; be so kind 
as to take it in to Dr. Maribel."</p>

<p>"It's no sort of use for you to wait. Dr. Maribel 
ain't at home; and Mrs. Parrott, that's his aunt, is a 
sensible woman, who knows, when she gets a penny, how 
to keep it in the bottom of her pocket."</p>

<!-- page 209 -->

<p>"Let me assure you," exclaimed Mr. Pultney, "that I
have no design upon Mrs. Parrott's pennies; and since 
Dr. Maribel is not at home, I will be really obliged to 
you if you will take my card to your mistress."</p>

<p>With the card something else was slipped into Nellie's 
hand. Of course the aspect of affairs changed at once. 
Now that she looked at him again, Nellie was really
astonished that she could have made so strange a mistake.</p>

<p>She returned in a few moments, unlocked the gate, and 
invited Mr. Pultney to enter.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Parrott is at home, sir, and begs that you will
come in."</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrott sat in her darkened room. She had bid 
Nellie pull down the blinds; and when Mr. Pultney 
greeted her, he saw only a little old woman in an arm-chair, 
who excused herself for not rising on account of her 
great affliction. He did not mark the curious scrutiny 
in her look, nor see the flash of recognition that passed 
over her face while she clasped her poor old hands tightly 
together on her lap.</p>

"Madam," said Mr. Pultney, bowing low, "when I 
will have acquainted you with the object of my visit, I 
am very sure that you will excuse the liberty of my somewhat 
persistent desire to be admitted to an interview. I
have but lately returned to the place of my birth, urged 
by what some would call the monomania of one cherished 
idea. I once had a child, madam&mdash;a daughter. One day, 

<!-- page 210 -->

not far from your house, I met a young girl&mdash;the very 
embodiment of loveliness&mdash;bearing a striking likeness to 
one whose name has long since failed to recall to me 
aught save the bitterness of remorseful shame. I accosted 
her, but she had never heard the name by which I addressed 
her; and completely discouraged, I returned to 
my desolate home without making an attempt to see Dr. 
Maribel.</p>

<p>"My father's treatment of me during my boyhood, and 
his taunts at our parting&mdash;which was under circumstances 
of peculiar bitterness&mdash;so completely estranged me from 
him that, for many long years, I have been ignorant of any 
knowledge concerning him. I have learned but lately that
a child was found beside his dead body, left there by some 
unknown person, and that she had about her dress a 
letter confiding her to the care of Dr. John Maribel. 
Madam, if you know anything of this child, and I assume
that you do, for the love of God, assuage a father's anxiety, 
and help him to restore her to the position which is 
by right her own."</p>

<p>The old lady had known beforehand why James Pultney 
had come. The change of name did not deceive her; 
she knew too that Agatha was in deadly peril. To put 
him off, to satisfy him that Kitty was not his child; to set 
him on a false track; to devise some means to deceive him, 
and to keep him from seeing John Maribel&mdash;these were 
the thoughts that coursed through Mrs. Parrott's brain, as 

<!-- page 211 -->

she looked at Mr. Pultney. Although far from being a
depraved woman, Mrs. Parrott would have been a better 
one had she not hardened her own heart, by a process of 
dissecting the worldly hearts by which, in former years, 
she had been surrounded. Her intimate knowledge of 
them had not helped to create general sympathy with 
mankind. Without further hesitation, she determined to 
sacrifice this man. Her love for Agatha was the one 
absorbing passion of her life.</p>

<p>She straightened herself in her chair; her face assumed
a hard, repellant expression, and she said:</p>

<p>"I have lived for many years with John Maribel; and 
if God has made the majority of men hard and selfish, 
seeking only their own good, unmindful of the claims of 
their fellows, He has also, in moments of divine clemency,
moulded creatures nearly akin to His own grand and pure 
attributes, in whom we recognize intuitively the difference 
between man and man. The best of characteristics are
often allied to faults which dim their lustre. In John 
Maribel I see the beauty of a character which is governed 
by the steady impulses of a virtuous and generous nature.
Unimaginative&mdash;looking at things in a homely, practical 
way, he is yet liable to be moved to the highest and 
noblest impulses, and to act from them regardless of consequences 
to himself.</p>

<p>"When he took Kitty to good old Mrs. Pitkin, he assumed 
the charge of her maintenance as a matter of course.

<!-- page 212 -->

He was poor at the time, very poor; but he conceived as 
he pressed the little helpless one to his breast, the highest
idea of charity&mdash;that which begins in self-denial, and
which suffers that self-denial in silence and in secret. His 
reward came in the love of the child. This love has been 
a strong motive power in his life; it has strengthened with 
years, and now holds him in its bondage. His noble self-abnegation, 
his beautiful humility, his delicate honor, all
act as safeguards to his prudence. He has never tried to 
force into flower the germs of a love which might have 
ripened into a woman's impassioned devotion. He is 
giving her a fair opportunity to choose for herself; but 
should she choose unwisely, it will break his heart. And 
<i>you</i> have come, sir, to put the first thorn into this man's 
flesh; to make him miserable and anxious by stirring up 
inquiries about Kitty's birth. The strongest probability
is that she is a child of old Mr. Featherstone. Spare 
John Maribel, who is satisfied as things are; spare the 
poor child whose life will be clouded by the 
knowledge of a mother's shame."</p>

<p>"My God! madam," exclaimed the agonized man, "do 
you not know that Catherine Featherstone, should she be 
alive, is more unfortunate even than is this foundling?
Have you never heard the story of Oscar Featherstone's
young wife?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, "I have heard her story; and in 
my judgment you have acted unwisely in coming to seek 

<!-- page 213 -->

for your daughter in a quiet country neighborhood, or 
even within the precincts of a town whose dimensions 
permit its inhabitants to know a great deal too much 
about one another's affairs. No, go to Paris; your wife 
is likely to be found in its giddy glare or else in some 
fair Italian city, where the soul is lulled into forgetfulness 
in the glamour of sunshine, and in the soft, voluptuous 
air. Go there to seek the woman, and you will in 
all likelihood find your child. A woman such as is your 
wife would never have abandoned her child&mdash;in Europe 
there are so many ways to make profit out of talent or 
beauty. I am taking for granted that the child of a beautiful 
and talented mother has inherited her gifts."</p>

<p>"Enough, enough," cried Mr. Pultney. "Was it necessary 
thus to pang my heart, to drag out its hidden dread, 
to bring me face to face with horrid probability? I will
obey you, madam&mdash;I will go back to Europe; I will seek 
there once more for my child. Believe me, on the honor 
of a gentleman, that John Maribel's life shall know no 
trouble from act of mine."</p>

<p>He took leave of the old lady in an aimless, hopeless 
sort of way. As he went out he saw not the far-off 
glory in the sky, nor heard the full waters lapping the 
white beach. He saw nothing, he heard nothing; Mrs.
Parrott's words had crushed out hope. The burning suspicion 
of what <i>might be</i> consumed his heart.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXI.</p>

<p class="small">"OPEN THY GATES OF MERCY, GRACIOUS GOD!"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the following morning a carriage might have 
been seen crossing the ford just above Searing's 
Mill. On reaching the opposite bank it stopped, 
and a gentleman, who was no other than Mr. Pultney, 
alighted from it, pausing only to pay the fare to the
coachman, before he set out to walk the short distance 
which would bring him to the gates of the avenue. 
The sun was just rising as he turned the rusty bolt and 
lingered to watch the glory of the opening day&mdash;to see 
the world grow conscious of its life in the smile of the 
beneficent sun. On his wan face was the look of one 
who, in the travail of sorrow, had caught sight of God's 
angels ascending and descending, bringing on their healing 
wings the balm of Christ's great consolation. The calm 
of a beautiful faith softened the lines of his worn countenance 
as he murmured reverently: "<i>Desiderat anima mea 
ad te Deus</i>."</p>

<p>Ursule had been on the look-out for him since daylight.
Her face brightened as at last she espied him coming up 
the avenue. He was walking, bare-headed, carrying his 

<!-- page 215 -->

hat in his hand, and she interpreted correctly the expression 
which she saw in his uplifted eyes when she said to 
herself:</p>

<p>"He has blundered into some fresh disappointment; 
but the humility of his great soul has already bowed with 
loving submission to God's will."</p>

<p>Going back to her kitchen, she poured out a cup of hot, 
fragrant coffee, and scarcely had he entered his room 
before she was there, pressing him to partake of it. Then, 
much as one manages a child, she threw a fur cloak about 
his shoulders, drew off his wet shoes and put on his 
slippers, exclaiming, when she had placed a soft footstool 
under his foot:</p>

<p>"There, you look better now! You are overtasking 
your strength, and your strange wanderings will end in 
your being brought home with some bad fever on you&mdash;and 
in this desolate place, without good Doctor Bernis! 
<i>Mon Dieu!</i> it makes me tremble to think of it."</p>

<p>"Take comfort, Ursule; we will go back to France."</p>

<p>"To France!" she exclaimed, her face radiant with 
joy.</p>

<p>"Yes, the sooner the better; this spot has ever been
fatal to me. My staying here has no longer an object. I
will go back to France."</p>

<p>He said this in a hopeless tone, with a manner of settled 
resignation which irritated Ursule into that peculiar 
movement of the shoulders which meant just that slight

<!-- page 216 -->

exasperation which her strong, energetic nature experienced 
when brought into contact with her master's 
besetting weakness.</p>

<p>During the years that she had served him with untiring
devotion and faithfulness, her rare discretion had avoided 
any manifested curiosity with regard to his history.
She had nevertheless gathered from words which he let 
fall from time to time, that, in spite of the extreme 
delicacy of his health and the brooding melancholy of his 
mind, there was something which sustained him and which 
helped him to live on. She shrewdly guessed that this 
something stimulated his restless anxiety and caused those
frequent absences from home that had an object which,
in his weak way, he was striving to attain.</p>

<p>Since Kitty's visit to the spring, Ursule had been tormented 
by a strange idea. Again and again Kitty's eyes 
seemed looking at her, and repeatedly she puzzled her 
brain to account for the persistence with which her 
memory dwelt upon each detail of her face and figure.
As she looked at Mr. Pultney now, she was startled to 
find herself searching in his face for what had seemed 
familiar to her in Kitty's; and it was almost with a 
guilty blush that she met his eyes as he suddenly raised 
them, for her quickened heart-throbs told her that she 
had made a discovery. The large, dark eyes, full of 
tender, liquid light, were like those of the "beautiful 
demoiselle."</p>

<!-- page 217 -->

<p>Ursule was essentially a discreet and prudent woman. 
She too truly loved her master to risk his displeasure by 
undue zeal or officiousness; but to her mind he was as
unfit as a child to grapple with difficulties. His very 
goodness and gentleness, his fear of injuring others, and
his guileless acceptance of whatever was told to him, were 
so many weapons which might be turned against him. 
He sadly lacked a knowledge of the ordinary motive 
springs of men and a safer acquaintance with the world in 
which he lived and with which he had scarcely a thought 
in common&mdash;he lacked the knowledge of the world which, 
if joined to higher qualities, makes them all the more 
commanding. Ursule went back to the kitchen, and soon 
the full notes of the organ swelled with the inspiration of
that "master and prince of God's music," Palestrina,
whose compositions for more than three hundred years 
have filled the domes of St. Peter and the naves of the 
Sistine with the sublimest of unapproached sublime 
music.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i> listen now," murmured Ursule. "What a 
man! I had all the trouble in the world to get the tenderloin 
steak for him and the fresh-laid eggs, and when I
take his breakfast to him, what with his walking and his 
organ-playing, he will be too exhausted to eat."</p>

<p>The juicy steak, the fresh-laid eggs, with the accompaniment 
of delicate rolls and chocolate in the <i>majolica</i> 
cup, were in due time placed before him; but, as Ursule

<!-- page 218 -->

had predicted, the appetite was wanting, and the savory 
breakfast was taken away with scarcely an evidence of 
its having been tasted.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten," she said, coming back into the room, 
"this was left for you," and she handed him John 
Maribel's card.</p>

<p>He held it in his hand looking at the name, as he said:
"I know all that he would have told me, Ursule. Make 
ready for our departure. It is urgent that I should leave
this place at once."</p>

<p>Ursule went back to her work, but her thoughts were 
busier than her hands. She had hitherto been content to 
perform the duties of a servant to this man. She had
known him first at Nantes. It was in the time of the 
vintage, and he had been wandering through the wine 
country, but on reaching Nantes he sickened and she was 
sent for to nurse him. He had paid her well, and she 
had never left him. At first she had stayed for the wages, 
afterwards because she grew to love him, his gentle helplessness 
winning from her that truly womanly feeling 
which is protective and faithful. The dependence of Mr. 
Pultney in no way interfered with her genuine respect for 
those qualities of heart and mind which her perspicacity 
enabled her to detect and appreciate. There was in him 
that union of grandeur and simplicity, of strength and 
weakness, which makes up a character peculiarly unfitted 
for the rough handling which one is apt to incur when 

<!-- page 219 -->

thrown into contact with the world; and so, long ago 
Ursule had placed herself between her master and those 
commonplace difficulties over which he would otherwise 
have been constantly stumbling. Now she began to see 
that she must go a step farther&mdash;he needed her clear, 
sound judgment, her active interference, and he should 
have it. The first step necessary was to see Dr. Maribel, 
and this she determined to do.</p>

<p>The kitchen had been improvised out of a former 
pantry. A Frenchwoman's quick intuition had converted 
the dilapidated room into a cozy apartment. The cooking 
utensils, the coppers and tins, were of exquisite 
brightness&mdash;the floor polished to the last degree of cleanliness&mdash;the 
stock of wood piled in a corner, and on the 
shelves, together with the commoner sort, were dishes 
and plates, and cups of old china&mdash;none alike, but all of 
beautiful design. A window opened on the back yard, 
and the gurgling of the spring, falling from the trough
into the pool, could be heard, suggesting coolness and refreshment. 
Among the thickly fallen leaves Ursule hears 
the rustle of footsteps, and then girlish voices: A moment 
afterwards Patty Searing and Abby Blackwell came in.
Abby carried a basket on her arm.</p>

<p>The sun-bonnets were laid aside, and Patty, by way of 
introducing Abby, took up her basket and uncovered the 
rolls of yellow butter and the fresh eggs.</p>

<p>"Abby Blackwell has come a long way, Madam Ursule, 

<!-- page 220 -->

and I hope you will buy her eggs and butter. You won't 
find such butter anywhere as they make at Hillside."</p>

<p>"It is like gold," said Ursule, "and the eggs so fresh&mdash;so 
fresh. Yes, I will take them; you have come far?"</p>

<p>"A matter of five miles," answered Abby, staring about 
her. Everything was so strange and new&mdash;even to be in
the old house without hearing the dreaded ghost was incredible, 
so firmly did she believe in the story of its 
being haunted.</p>

<p>Patty Searing had regularly furnished Ursule with milk
and vegetables since the tenants came to live at the old 
place, and in many ways she had made herself useful to
the foreign woman, who liked her bright face and pleasant 
smile, and looked forward to her visits as an agreeable 
break upon her solitude. This one afforded the opportunity 
for asking some questions about the neighborhood&mdash;an 
interest developed since her master's return. It 
had hitherto been confined to her immediate surroundings, 
and these were so utterly out of keeping with cheerfulness 
and comfort that she naturally associated the whole of 
America with the ideas of disgust with which she beheld 
them, and as naturally evinced a strong dislike to extending 
her acquaintance with its people. Now, however, a 
controlling motive urged her to ask those questions which 
the loquacious Abby was only too ready to answer.</p>

<p>Yes, of course, she knew the young lady who had 
come to the spring with Col. Covington. They were grand 

<!-- page 221 -->

folks, these Covingtons and Wilbrahams; and how Kitty 
Pitkin ever got to stay there, Abby didn't know. "I 
suppose it's all on account of Dr. Maribel," she continued. 
"He's mighty fond of her, and comes up once or twice a 
week regular. People do say there's somebody she likes 
better, but to my thinking she'd better keep to Dr.
Maribel."</p> 

<p>Ursule had bent her whole attention to Abby's words, 
and she had gathered from them the possibility of seeing 
Dr. Maribel within a very few days.</p>

<p>"And the name of the beautiful <i>demoiselle? Pardon</i>, 
I forget."</p>

<p>"Kitty Pitkin."</p>

<p>"Oh! but it is barbarous. <i>Keety Peetkin!</i>"</p>

<p>"You do not perhaps know, Madam Ursule," said 
Patty, "that Kitty is short for Catherine."</p>

<p>"Catherine&mdash;ah! yes&mdash;Catherine is a very pretty name&mdash;Catherine&mdash;ah! 
yes."</p>

<p>Ursule had discovered her first clue. She had seen the 
name of "Catherine Featherstone" in an old prayer-book 
upstairs.</p>

"Don't you know Babet over at Worleigh?" continued 
Abby. "She came there with Mrs. Wilbraham, 
and the servants they hate her like <i>pisen</i>. She turns up 
her nose at folks that are her betters anyhow! Miss 
Eleanor&mdash;she's Mr. Wilbraham's sister&mdash;they say is 
fretting her life out, and I reckon Mr. Wilbraham would 

<!-- page 222 -->

come home fast enough if he knew some other things that 
are going about."</p>

<p>Abby would have gossiped all the morning, but Ursule 
had learned all that she wanted to know. She would see 
Dr. Maribel that very week, and must make a pretext for 
going to Oaklands.</p>

<p>Fate never grows weary of her work. She weaves the 
intricate meshes of her woof, twisting into it, with subtle 
and marvellous cunning, lives that seem far apart, yet in 
some mysterious way influence one another. Mrs. Parrott
slept, satisfied that Agatha's secret was safe. Ursule 
watched in the lonely house with all the goings on of the 
world</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">
 
<p class="small">"Inaudible as dreams."</p>

<p>Her busy brain was fast undoing Mrs. Parrott's work.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXII.</p>

<p class="small">" 'TIS PROBABLE AND PALPABLE TO THINKING."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Old</span> Mr. Featherstone had sold the greater part 
of the furniture of the house; but his wife's and 
Oscar's rooms had remained pretty much as 
they had left them, except what dampness and rats had 

<!-- page 223 -->

destroyed. From those rooms Ursule had taken various 
articles for her master's use, but there were chests of 
drawers, armoires, and closets which had not been opened 
for years; these she determined to visit. The hope of discovery 
stimulated her to execute her purpose without 
delay. The unsteady stairway, creaking under her weight, 
seemed to protest against the invasion of its long rest, 
and from out of the black shadows in the long hall the 
bats came sweeping towards the light, wheeling around 
and around her head, fluttering their hideous wings, and 
snapping their teeth in a spiteful way, as if they, too, 
were putting in a protest against an intrusion upon premises 
which long possession had given them the right to 
claim as their own.</p>

<p>Ursule opened the door of Mrs. Featherstone's room.
The massive mahogany bed stood just where it had been 
placed when Ethan Featherstone superintended the arrangement 
of this room for the reception of his bride.
An old-fashioned dressing-table held the dust-covered 
toilet articles; a couch, from which the covering had 
long since fallen away, kept company with the chairs; a 
smell of dampness everywhere&mdash;a worn, silent decay, 
clinging to the old walls and the blackened pictures hanging 
on them. Ursule was a brave woman, but she was 
not proof against ghostly terrors which came so naturally 
there, with the dead woman's property crumbling away
into decay, and the close, damp odor of the charnel-house 

<!-- page 224 -->

rising up around her. She put down the candle which 
she carried, and made the sign of the cross.</p>

<p>"They always have them," she thought; "these Protestants
record the births and deaths in them." She was in 
search of Mrs. Featherstone's family Bible.</p>

<p>On each side of the fireplace were cupboards with doors. 
Ursule tried one of them. The rusty lock yielded; but 
the shelves were empty&mdash;nothing save one or two broken 
wine-glasses and some bottles. These had probably been 
used for the dead woman&mdash;these bottles had contained the 
medicines which human skill had devised to relieve the 
pangs of suffering and to arrest the progress of death.
The other cupboard had evidently been a receptacle for 
books and papers; the moths and mice, however, had left
but few traces of either. Ursule was about to close the 
door, when she espied on the topmost shelf a tin box, 
secured by a padlock. After trying one after another of 
the keys on her bunch, she succeeded in opening it with 
a small brass one. The box contained old letters, yellow 
with time and mouldy with damp; but her face brightened 
with satisfaction as, on opening the very first one, 
she found the signature to be that of "Catherine Featherstone."</p>

<p>Tucking the box under her arm and taking up the 
candle, she went out of the room, closing and locking the 
door. She paused, for from below there arose a sad, plaintive 
strain. It filled the midnight stillness of the old 

<!-- page 225 -->

house with echoes sweet and long, dying away in a minor 
chord. Music takes to itself a thousand gentle, suggestive 
tones&mdash;it is the language of the soul&mdash;its communion
with God. Those wailing notes seemed like the cry of a 
weary soul doomed to its fetters of sorrow through a 
long, sad life. There was something in the last despairing 
chord that spoke, as nothing else could have done, to Ursule's 
heart. A great pity went out to the gentle, suffering 
soul. She paused outside his door. The vibration of 
the organ filled the room as if the hand still lingered on 
the keys. Ursule softly turned the lock. Her master sat 
before the organ, his hands pressing the ivory keys; but 
his head had sunk forward, and in a moment more he 
would have fallen to the floor. It was the work of a 
minute for the strong woman to lift the fragile form and 
bear it to his bed in the adjoining room. She had seen 
him thus before faint from long watching and fatigue. 
The remedies were close at hand, and when she received 
his grateful smile after swallowing the reviving cordial, 
she left him, but only to go into the next room and put
down the lamp, then to creep back and sit beside the bed 
until daylight; but as the light grew brighter in the eastern 
window, she noticed with feelings of keen alarm the 
sure indications of fever in the restless sleeper. She was 
alarmed almost to the point of forgetting her usual prudence. 
The dread of having her master ill in that lonely 
place had taken away from her the full exercise of her 

<!-- page 226 -->

faculties; for she stood like one who had received some 
sudden check which had stunned her. The consciousness 
of peril to one beloved rarely stimulates quick action; the 
mind must have time to accustom itself to the shock, before 
it revives sufficiently to obtain command over those 
emotions which are fatal to the calm exercise of its reasoning 
powers. A word, a sound, is sometimes all that is 
necessary to bring new agencies into action, and the sound 
of wood-splitting in the kitchen brought with it the consciousness 
of human aid, which, at the moment, was what 
Ursule most needed. The hired boy was making the fire.
Ursule flew to the kitchen. "Go to the mill," she cried; 
"tell them that I will pay any price to have a messenger 
sent at once for Dr. Maribel."</p>

<p>Only a few hours before, Ursule had been devising how 
she could bring about an interview with John Maribel, 
and now, through the very means which she most dreaded, 
she saw the accomplishment of her purpose. Her master 
was ill&mdash;away from Dr. Bernis&mdash;away from France, and, 
in her opinion, very far from all human aid; so she prayed 
all the more fervently to the good Lord.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXIII.</p>

<p class="small">"BUT DOTH HE KNOW THAT I AM IN THE FOREST?"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> speckled hens walked demurely up the roost, 
and fumed and rustled until they had settled 
themselves comfortably for the night; while the 
lordly cock followed, his plumage all green and gold as a 
sun-ray touched him with its glittering sheen. From the 
upper floor of the great barn, Jope threw down armfuls of 
fragrant hay to the mild-eyed oxen, and the cows stepped 
eagerly across the bars which separated them from their 
dappled calves. With milking-stool and pail, Mrs. Blackwell 
was ready for them, and as she drew the rich milk
from the full udders, her eyes wandered frequently in the 
direction of the road.</p>

<p>Mark Blackwell was late coming from the field. The 
fodder must be gathered&mdash;there were threatening clouds 
grouping in the north-west; and then, a neighbor had 
stopped to say that down by the creek he had found a 
litter of young pigs in their bed of pine-straw. After the 
fodder had been piled, Blackwell went down to see whether 
the pigs belonged to him. He searched about amid the 

<!-- page 228 -->

growing shadows, under the great pines, and where the 
magnolia and the bay trees dropped their glossy leaves.
He crushed with his great rough shoes the wild mint and 
the tender green moss that clung about the roots of the 
trees; and at last, huddled together in their comfortable
bed, he found the little pinkish-white things, with the 
huge, ugly mother grunting about them. He would come
down for them to-morrow, he thought, and making his way 
through the knotted grass and tangled underwood, he 
came out upon the road near the confines of Worleigh.</p>

<p>The old man was weary with his day's work. He had 
stood in the field since early morning, only stopping to 
rest at noon, when he ate his dinner under the shade of 
the great walnut tree. He had expected Abby to bring it, 
and he was disappointed and angry when Jope told him
that she had gone out to sell her eggs and butter. How
often had he expressed disapproval of these journeys&mdash;how 
often had he forbidden her going from home without protection! 
"By this time," he said to himself, "she must 
be at home helping her mother with the milking."</p>

<p>The shadows darkened&mdash;the night came on apace, and 
just here the pines stood thick and their pungent odor 
grew stronger in the freshened breeze, and then the sun
sank down behind the hills, and one by one the welcome 
stars came out. All his life had Blackwell lived in field
and forest; year after year had he watched seed-time and 
harvest, toiling always with frugal industry and patient 

<!-- page 229 -->

waiting. Living in close communion with Nature, it was 
strange that he had never caught the sweetness of her 
voices, or learned, through her teaching, the gentle lesson 
of God's love. No, he knew Him only in the awful 
majesty of a jealous and sin-punishing divinity. He sang 
now, as he walked along, "Sinners wherefore will ye die?" 
in a strong, harsh bass voice. Not far from the road, 
seated on the trunk of a fallen tree, with De Rousy by her 
side, Abby heard him and shuddered; for she knew that 
his just anger would fall upon her, should he discover her 
sinful disobedience. The hand which De Rousy held 
turned cold. In terror she snatched it from him and rose 
to her feet.</p> 

<p>"Father will get home, and I am not there," she said.</p>

<p>"What of that?" answered De Rousy.</p>

<p>"I don't like to be scolded and misjudged; and that I 
would be if anybody says that I've done any harm, sitting 
here talking to you."</p>

<p>"Nothing could be more innocent, my dear," said De 
Rousy, with a disagreeable smile, attempting to possess 
himself of her hand. "Come, <i>ma belle</i>, confess that you 
love me just a little. Is it so hard a thing to do?"</p>

<p>Abby did not answer directly. She was vain and ignorant, 
but not altogether wanting in sense, and she knew 
that any yielding on her part would be dangerous. The
man's subtle arguments were fast searching out the evil 
in her nature and striking at the root of her filial respect 

<!-- page 230 -->

and duty, and it must be confessed that weak dread of 
consequences, rather than any honest opposition to his 
wishes, made her cautious. It little concerned Gaston de
Rousy how, for his own selfish gratification, he tampered 
with her good name and risked an honest man's happiness.
Indeed, if he thought at all about it, it was to scoff at the 
idea of a common fellow like Perry knowing anything of 
the refinement of feeling which would cause him to suffer 
under an infidelity. In his code of morals, money was an 
all-healing salve, and when he grew weary of Abby's rustic 
charms, Perry should be heartily welcome to them.</p>

<p>"Good-night," she said; "I am going straight across 
the meadow, and if I walk fast I'll get home before father."</p>

<p>"You won't answer, Abby?"</p>

<p>"No," she exclaimed, "I won't. I wouldn't be a hypocrite, 
if I were you! Perhaps I don't know about Kitty 
Pitkin."</p>

<p>She darted away through the "green gloom of the wood," 
and, on opening the gate that led into the barn-yard, she 
found herself face to face with Perry. He had watched 
her crossing the meadow, and now he let her pass without 
speaking. He could not for the life of him have said a 
word to her.</p>

<p>Paler than was her wont, and breathing with the loud 
respiration of one laboring under the effect of unusual 
exertion, Abby went into the kitchen where her mother 
was preparing the supper.</p>

<!-- page 231 -->

<p>"Oh, Abby! I'm so glad that you have come! Where 
have you been all day?" said Mrs. Blackwell, looking 
searchingly into her face and feeling that uneasiness in her 
heart which she called a "presentiment," but which was 
really the alarm of conscience, accusing her of weakness 
in her control of her daughter, and sounding a danger 
which she might have seen if she had not persistently shut 
her eyes to it.</p>

<p>"Why, mother, I've been down to Searing's," she said, 
"and Patty walked part of the way back with me. I 
sold the eggs and butter to the French woman who is 
staying at the old Featherstone place with that queer man 
that nobody can get a sight of. She's free enough with 
her money, anyhow."</p>

<p>Opening her little leather purse, she poured the silver 
on the table. This unusual generosity softened the poor 
mother almost to tears; for Abby had pushed the money 
towards her, saying: "There, you can have it."</p>

<p>"Why, Abby! what's come over you, to give me the 
money? Jope's going to town the day after to-morrow, 
and he can buy you the dark calico and the stockings that 
you said you wanted. Put your money back in your 
purse, daughter. Mother doesn't need it."</p>

<p>The girl took up the silver and dropped it piece by 
piece into the purse. She had offered her sacrifice to 
conscience, and was secretly satisfied that her mother 
had made it no harder for her.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXIV.</p>

<p class="small">"NAY, NOW I SEE SHE IS YOUR TREASURE."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parrott</span> was waiting for John Maribel.
It was no unusual thing for the old lady to sit 
half the night,</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Desiring what was mingled with past years,<br/>

In yearnings that could not be expressed<br/>

By signs or groans or tears."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Each day was now to bring to her its torturing terrors 
until she were assured that Oscar Featherstone had left 
the country. She waited from hour to hour listening for 
John Maribel's footsteps, and when at last he came in to 
his supper, she marked his silence and the gravity of his 
face. He had usually a little cheerful gossip kept especially 
for the old lady's ear, and detailed in dainty little bits 
while he ate; for he had rarely time now to sit long with 
her, and his meals were taken at irregular hours just 
when he could be spared from his patients. John had 
never been much governed by rules, and of late he had 
fallen sadly into forgetting the dinner-hour and his "duty 
to his stomach," as Mrs. Parrott often told him. It did 
not occur to him now that he was indulging in the egotism 

<!-- page 233 -->

of silence, or that he was permitting Mrs. Parrott to 
get a glimpse into his individual interior life. The astute
old lady read, like a book, the face which she had studied 
for so many years&mdash;a face which, in its frank good-humor, 
had brightened the hours of her weary life as 
never face had done before.</p>

<p>There is nothing more exhaustive to the human mind 
than the concentration of the consciousness upon one 
train of thought&mdash;a too long continued strain upon its 
functions.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrott would have been glad to hear John talk in 
his old pleasant way about the sick people and the babies. 
He had been to Oaklands&mdash;he had seen Kitty, and he had 
not a word to say. She remarked, too, that he swallowed 
his tea like one suffering from thirst, while he scarcely 
tasted the cold chicken. Rising and going to the mantel-shelf, 
he took a cigar.</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't sit up for me, Aunt," he said, 
scraping a match and proceeding to light the cigar. "In 
one way and another I have had a fatiguing day of it, 
and I shall be glad to get to bed. By the by, Kitty sent 
you a message. She is coming to town next week.
Smiley wants her to sign some papers. I believe he has 
sold the old shop. I am to give you her love; to say 
that she is quite well and&mdash;and&mdash;I really forget."</p>

<p>"You are not apt to fail in remembering Kitty's messages, 
John. Is there anything amiss with the child?"</p>

<!-- page 234 -->

<p>"Oh, no," he answered absently; then striking the 
ashes from his cigar with his finger, he continued, following 
the train of thought which had given to his face its 
grave and absorbed expression: "We cannot expect to 
keep her always to ourselves. It would scarcely be fair 
to her to wish it; and we must not hold it too hard, 
Aunt, if she likes her new life and the people with whom 
she is associated. It is all quite natural&mdash;it is even our 
duty, knowing as we do that the mystery about her birth 
is yet to be cleared, not to throw any obstacle in the way 
of having it done."</p>

<p>It was easier for him to associate Mrs. Parrott with 
his own feelings about Kitty. She knew at once that he 
had detected in the young girl that change which she had 
foreseen. It was certain that the best part of her nature 
would never develop in Agatha's society. None knew 
better than Mrs. Parrott how rapturously the young enjoy 
the luxuriance of the life which wealth, refinement, and 
cultivation create&mdash;how naturally their fancies give birth 
to hopes which can be realized only in this summer-day 
life. She knew, too, the subtle fascination which Agatha 
exercised over those whom she cared to please, and that 
Kitty, ignorant of the world and its ways, her homely 
life transformed into one of alluring enjoyment, must of 
necessity undergo a moral change. She would judge of 
things from a different standpoint; and what is so probable 
as that John should be the first to discover this? He 

<!-- page 235 -->

had seen her happy, and he had had no part in creating 
her happiness, and the seductive loveliness which was 
every day expanding into new charms would draw to her
the love and admiration of others. John was jealous&mdash;jealous 
of his darling. It required not the marvel of 
second-sight to see this; but Mrs. Parrott knew that the 
great, honest heart of the man would easily reject a feeling 
which she half suspected was the offspring of the purest 
and most unselfish love. When he had said good-night 
and gone away, she sat with all the hard lines about
her old face softened into regretful tenderness. A tear 
fell on her folded hands.</p>

<div class="center" id="ch35">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXV.</p>

<p class="small">"SIR, I WOULD SPEAK WITH YOU."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a dingy street, up a flight of steps, into a dingy 
hall on the right hand side, was the office of 
Meredith Smiley, Attorney and Counsellor at 
Law. Mr. Smiley sat in an inner office, which was comfortably 
furnished and well lighted. As he leaned back
in his chair, his cheek resting on his thin, long hand, the 

<!-- page 236 -->

contraction of his brow indicated the perplexity of his 
thoughts. The outer office was occupied by a young 
gentleman who, at that moment, was busily engaged 
biting his finger-nails. To see the hungry manner in
which he attacked each of his fingers in turn, one would 
naturally have supposed that starving had driven him into 
self-devouring. The truth was that he, also, was in great 
mental tribulation; for he had mounted Pegasus, and, 
whip and spur as he might, the naughty steed would not 
scale the heights of Helicon. A sheet of note paper, 
drawn from between the leaves of the ponderous volume 
on the desk before him, would have convicted him of 
having outraged the muse and, also, of an unblushing 
design to lengthen the outrage by a sixth verse; for he 
had written "Oh!" and taken another bite at his thumb-nail, 
when the voice of Mr. Smiley cruelly interrupted 
the completion of the line. "Benjamin, have you drawn 
up that bill of sale?" asked the bland attorney.</p>

<p>"In a minute, sir."</p>

<p>The verses were thrust between the leaves of Blackstone, 
and the rapid scratching of the pen satisfied Mr. 
Smiley that Benjamin had, for the thousandth time, been 
weakly succumbing to the wiles of the old thief, Procrastination.</p>

<p>Meredith Smiley, attorney and counsellor at law, had been
shaped by nature out of the most approved legal pattern.
There was in his manner a pleasing earnestness, joined 

<!-- page 237 -->

to bland urbanity, which was as distinctive a mark of his 
calling as is the Roman collar of the holy office of priesthood. 
So long had he simulated virtue, that he almost 
believed in the genuineness of the feelings which he expressed 
in language as remarkable for its purity as it was 
for a felicitous choice of words. I was going to say that 
he agreed with Talleyrand that "<i>La parole a &eacute;t&eacute; donn&eacute;e &agrave; 
l'homme pour d&eacute;guiser sa pens&eacute;e;</i>" but I know that one 
hundred thousand, and more, people have allowed themselves 
to be hoodwinked by this pretended saying of Talleyrand, 
which is really the first sentence in Ciyas' prolegomena 
of the civil law, which reads in this wise: "<i>La 
parole a &eacute;t&eacute; accord&eacute;e &agrave; l'homme pour exprimer sa pens&eacute;e</i>."
The only thing of Talleyrand's is the cynicism of substituting 
<i>d&eacute;guiser</i> for <i>exprimer</i>. When it suited his purpose, 
Mr. Smiley's happy phraseology expressed anything rather 
than his true convictions. The want of color about him 
struck one at first somewhat unpleasantly. His hair, of a 
pale, sandy hue, was growing thin about the temples, and 
his light blue eyes were set very close to a nose of unusual 
sharpness. Thin lips, white, regular teeth, and a certain 
doughiness of complexion, with a profuse sprinkling of 
wrinkles about the eyes and around the mouth, made up 
his characteristic physiognomy. He studiously avoided 
treading upon other people's toes; and the mild benevolence 
of his manner was peculiarly impressive. Indeed, 
Mr. Smiley was a favorite with old ladies, and derived a 

<!-- page 238 -->

large share of his practice from these credulous flies whom 
he so easily caught in the web of legal chicanery.</p>

<p>There was the patter of ascending feet on the stairs, a
low, sweet laugh, and Benjamin's hands went up to his 
hair instinctively as he got down from his stool, and, 
putting on his best manner, held open the door. Kitty 
entered, accompanied by John Maribel. Like a sweet 
breath of country air, she came into the dingy office, her 
bright face fairly lighting up the dusty old place, and setting 
Benjamin beside himself with much admiration.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Hall?" she said, as she gave 
him her little gloved hand with a witching smile.</p>

<p>Benjamin stammered that he believed that he was very 
well, and went back to his desk, thinking that it would be 
an easy matter now to write his sixth verse. Kitty's presence 
was the inspiration which he had needed. There were, 
however, two associated facts which acted adversely to the
success of the would-be poet. One was, that his eyes would 
wander towards Kitty, and the other that the muse had 
suddenly grown so coy, that when he did catch a thought 
and managed to embody it, he found, to his dismay, that 
it expressed something quite different from what he intended 
saying.</p>

<p>The business was speedily transacted, and John Maribel 
and Kitty took leave. Oh! how dark and gloomy 
did the office appear to poor Benjamin, when the door
closed behind them.</p>

<!-- page 239 -->

<p>On the stairs they met a dapper little man breathing 
very loudly at each step, and seeming to find great difficulty
in reaching the top with his short legs. The presence of 
Mr. McStebbins at the threshold of Mr. Smiley's office 
was disagreeably suggestive of some new development in 
Kitty's affairs.</p>

<p>John Maribel could not but know that she was nearing 
her majority, and that some great change was imminent for 
her. They went out into the golden sunshine. As he 
walked by her side, he felt a joy which grow out of the 
reality of the moment. She was not the once light-hearted 
child&mdash;he know this&mdash;but her voice fell still sweetly upon
his ear as her hand rested upon his arm.</p>

<p>John Maribel did not consider that the repression of 
his own feelings had lent to his manner a certain reserve, 
and that Kitty was thereby unconsciously influenced. 
Woman's intuition rarely fails her; her reasoning is not 
always correct, and she seldom analyzes; but she is a good 
physiognomist and rarely fails to read aright the face of 
one in whom her heart is interested. Kitty stole a glance 
at John's face; she saw that the hair about the temples 
was turning gray, and she feared that the dear, good friend 
was carrying some trouble in his heart. Moved by a 
sympathetic motive in which her thoughts were urged 
to express themselves, she said:</p>

<p>"Dear John, shall I go home with you?"</p>

<p>He did not answer immediately, for he was sorely 

<!-- page 240 -->

tempted to bid her stay&mdash;his home was so desolate; but 
he checked the words that would have told her this. "It 
is but an impulse," he thought, "a generous one, but an 
impulse for all that," so he said:</p>

<p>"You have promised Mrs. Covington, dear. It is kind 
of you to think of coming back, but I cannot consent to 
your giving up the country in this beautiful summer 
weather."</p>

<p>Kitty drew away her hand from John's arm; something 
in his tone had wounded her. She even walked a little 
farther from him. John Maribel saw it all; but he could 
not comfort her. He would not by word or act bind her 
by the past. He wanted her love, not her duty. In his 
loyal sense of right he could not take advantage of circumstances&mdash;he 
had not one claim to urge against her free 
choice.</p>

<p>"Kitty," he said, "I am not ungrateful, but&mdash;but&mdash;it 
is best, dear, that you should be under the protection of 
Mrs. Covington, at least, just now."</p>

<p>"And why just now?" she exclaimed, a vivid color 
suffusing her face.</p>

<p>"Because," answered John Maribel, "she is a safer 
guardian for you than I am, dear Kitty."</p>

<p>She but half understood him, although inclination is 
often stronger than duty; and in her heart she was well 
satisfied that she might go back to Oaklands.</p>

<!-- page 241 -->

<p>"There is Mrs. Wilbraham's carriage. See! she is 
beckoning to us, John."</p>

<p>Smiling and gracious, Agatha leaned from the carriage; 
but John's professional eye detected, even through her 
veil, the marks of recent agitation. No wonder, for she 
had but a short time before passed through one of those 
passionate interviews with Mrs. Parrott, which left her
weak and exhausted. She sat there smiling and talking 
to John Maribel, and she had the knowledge of her 
deadly peril lying like a weight upon her heart. She
had walked to and from his house, her dress covered with 
a light shawl and her face concealed beneath a thick veil.
Only a few moments before their meeting had she seated 
herself in her carriage and bade the coachman drive slowly 
towards Mr. Smiley's office.</p>

<p>"How fortunate to have overtaken you, Miss Pitkin," 
she exclaimed; "I am charged with a message from 
Mrs. Covington. She bids me say that she hopes it 
will suit your pleasure to ride back to Oaklands with 
me. Need I add how delighted I shall be with your company?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I am very much obliged to you, Mrs. Wilbraham," 
answered Kitty, taking her seat beside her. 
"You will come up very soon, dear John," she added, 
turning to him and looking at his grave, quiet face.</p>

<p>"Shall you want me, Kitty?"</p>

<!-- page 242 -->

<p>"I don't think that I deserve to have you ask me, 
John."</p>

<p>Her hand was in his&mdash;her face close to him. It lost 
nothing of its beauty in the white sunlight&mdash;it only seemed 
more lovely and more real in its warm life. A great 
desire lighted up his eyes into a momentary betrayal of 
his secret. Agatha saw it; but she understood this man 
as little as she understood the higher duties of life. He 
was dangerous in her sight because she could not comprehend 
that his love was a safeguard in itself&mdash;that its 
purity was so little commingled with the grosser elements 
of passion&mdash;so tenacious of its loyal intentions that it was 
a sublime consolation to John Maribel, even while he 
suffered acutely at the thought of its disappointment. It
was so natural to love Kitty, that he must always go on 
loving her. It never occurred to him that anything that 
she might do could prevent this&mdash;that any circumstance 
could substantially interfere with his interest in her. 
"Delicately pure and marvellously fair" was that sweet 
young face. Oh! Kitty was to be desired above all 
things earthly; but he must have her as a free gift, or 
not at all.</p>

<p>He had said "good-by," and was turning to go back to 
his office, when his steps were arrested by Jope. He had 
been standing near the carriage, just where he could get 
sight of Kitty.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Doctor," he said, "but I was 

<!-- page 243 -->

waiting to get a chance to speak to you. Reuben Searing 
came to our house this morning to borrow a horse to come 
after you. I just thought as I'd rather ride brown Betty 
myself; so I saddled her and came on fast as she would 
carry me. The gentleman at the old place, sir, is took as 
bad as can be, and the French woman sent over to Searing's 
at daylight; but they lost time looking up the mule; and 
then Reuben had to come over to our house. So, as time 
has been lost, sir, and I'm afraid he's pretty bad off, you'll 
please, sir, to come right along."</p>

<p>Agatha heard every word. She noted the strange look 
on John Maribel's face, and the quick movement of his 
eyes towards Kitty.</p>

<div class="center" id="ch36">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXVI.</p>

<p class="small">"A LUNATIC, LEAN-WITTED FOOL."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. McStebbins</span> sat opposite to Meredith 
Smiley. The long white finger of the lawyer 
was pointing to a passage in a legal document 
before him, which he read slowly, emphasizing each word, 
and making pauses, which seemed to have an irritating 

<!-- page 244 -->

effect upon his companion, who, with knit brows, sat 
impatiently tapping the table with his short, pudgy 
finger.</p>

<p>"I must confess, Smiley, that you have given me an 
overdose of law to-day," exclaimed Mr. McStebbins 
when the tedious formula had been gone through with.
"I shan't enjoy my dinner, I never do, after coming 
here. A man had as well put on a hair shirt at once 
as to stand all this brain friction over your legal technicalities.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">" 'You know the law, your exposition<br/>

Hath been most sound: I charge you, by the law<br/>

Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,<br/>

Proceed to&mdash;explanation.' "</p>

</blockquote>

<p>A look of annoyance passed over the lawyer's face. 
There was in Mr. McStebbins' manner just a shade 
of insolence, aroused, perhaps by a suspicion that the 
lawyer underrated his powers of comprehension, and 
had purposely lengthened out the tiresome details of the 
law.</p> 

<p>"Will you permit me to say, Mr. McStebbins," answered 
Mr. Smiley, "that the will is clear, succinct, and definite 
in every clause. As it stands, I see no question which 
can arise as to the feasibility of carrying out its conditions. 
Remember that my opinion is based upon my 
knowledge of circumstances as they exist to-day&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 245 -->

<p>"Good God! Smiley, why do you come in with your 
'buts'? "</p>

<p>"But," continued the imperturbable lawyer, "should 
complications arise, the consequences might be grave. 
The conditions of the will are imperative."</p>

<p>"You mean to say that any violation of them would 
materially affect the heir-at-law?"</p>

<p>"Most assuredly. In case of such violation, she will be 
deprived of the bulk of the property, receiving only the 
moderate annuity of five hundred dollars. The residue of 
the estate goes to the son of Mrs. de Ferri&egrave;re, who was
Mr. Featherstone's only sister. This young man is a dissipated 
adventurer, whom I have failed to trace. Some 
years ago he had a difficulty at Wiesbaden with an Austrian 
officer. I was in Paris at the time, and happened to 
hear of the circumstances, which were very damaging to 
the character of young De Ferri&egrave;re. Since then, I have 
entirely lost sight of him, and I fervently hope that I may 
have no occasion to seek him."</p>

<p>"Let me see," said Mr. McStebbins, holding up the 
forefinger of his left hand and tapping it with the forefinger
of his right. "The malignant old fool imagined 
that, after eighteen years of church-yard, he could put his 
skeleton finger into the pie and control the life of such a 
creature as Catherine Featherstone. Smiley, the whole 
thing is a piece of idiotic cruelty; the emanation of a diseased 
mind. I have watched this young girl from her infancy; 

<!-- page 246 -->

and I believe that, should she become aware of the 
circumstances and conditions upon which she receives her 
grandfather's money, she will refuse to touch a cent of it."</p>

<p>"She is not to know. Some touch of mercy moved 
the old sinner's heart to stipulate that she is never to 
know his reasons for having left her during the years of 
her childhood to the care of strangers."</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! So this far-seeing man leaves a secret to the 
keeping of his executors, and does not take into account 
the hundred other people who may chance to know why 
Oscar Featherstone left his wife to go and die, the Lord 
knows where. The poor wretch took himself, meekly 
enough, out of the way, and the old man seems to have
believed in his death. There is no mention made of him 
in the will?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Mr. Smiley; "and yet, I am not at
all sure in my own mind that Oscar Featherstone is dead. 
In case he does exist, and that his identity can be clearly 
proven, he has nothing to do but to claim his daughter 
and the estate."</p>

<p>"Would to God he'd come and do it, then," exclaimed 
Mr. McStebbins. "I have been drawn into this matter 
against my will, and, by the by, you said something about 
complications."</p>

<p>"I am not prepared to go farther into the matter, Mr. 
McStebbins. We must, however, always provide for possibilities."</p>

<!-- page 247 -->

"Well," said Mr. McStebbins, rising from his seat, 
"when a man has been ferreting out possibilities as
long as you have he is quite apt to find them. Pray 
don't trouble yourself about letting me have a share of 
them. When you've something tangible, that my mind 
can take hold of, I will try to bring my reason to bear 
upon it."</p>

<p>"We ought to be prepared at every point, sir," said 
the lawyer, "and, therefore, I have thought it advisable 
to refresh your memory with regard to old Featherstone's 
intentions, as expressed in his will, of which this is a 
copy," tapping the paper with his finger. "Should I 
have anything of importance to communicate, I will do 
myself the pleasure of calling upon you."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXVII.</p>

<p class="small">"FALSE FACE MUST HIDE WHAT THE FALSE HEART DOTH
KNOW."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ride back to Worleigh was particularly trying 
to Agatha; for although on the rack of 
great mental agony she manifested no sign of it, 
except in frequent fits of nervous laughter, which jarred
unpleasantly upon Kitty's ear. Once Agatha turned suddenly 
to her and asked whether she had ever thought 
much about her mother.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, "a great deal within the last few 
weeks."</p>

<p>"And why within the last few weeks?"</p>

<p>Kitty flushed as she answered: "I imagine that no 
tenderness can be like that of a mother to her child&mdash;no 
love so complete; and I think that I am peculiarly unfortunate 
to be deprived of it."</p>

<p>Agatha looked away from her to hide her white, quivering 
face. She felt herself faltering in her resolution; but 
the remembrance of De Rousy's words checked the outburst 
of tenderness which trembled on her lips. She 
knew how greatly her safety depended upon her prudence 

<!-- page 249 -->

and self-control. What if Oscar Featherstone should not 
go away? what if Hugh Wilbraham should discover her 
perfidy? Little did she dream that the greatest danger 
lay at her very threshold, coiling like a serpent about her 
feet. She knew not that the smiling, handsome man, 
who stood waiting to assist them from the carriage, bore
within his breast an intent of blackest treachery and ingratitude
towards herself. She marked his kindling eye 
as it rested upon Kitty, and she felt that her own life was 
over; for she counted only the years of her youth and 
beauty, and at that moment she scarcely knew whether 
to regret the days gone by, or to rejoice that her career 
was near its close. What woman would crown herself 
again with her beauty to watch its gradual decay, or care
to live only to remember the triumphs, which all save herself 
have forgotten? Who would take up the sceptre, 
only to go through the pangs of abdication? How hard to 
listen to the <i>siffleur</i>, when the ear has been attuned to the 
applause of the <i>claque</i>. Thus morbidly thought Agatha 
as she stood before her mirror that night, taking down 
her long air. As it fell around her wan face, how thin 
and pallid it looked, with her large eyes dilated with passionate 
despair and the rouge washed from her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Madame," cried Babet, coming in from the dressing-room, 
"why do you fatigue yourself to take down your 
hair? You look faint; let me give you a little brandy&mdash;only 
a spoonful."</p>

<!-- page 250 -->

<p>"No," answered Agatha, "no brandy; but you may 
brush out my hair. It soothes me when I am nervous."</p>

<p>Babet took up the long, blue-black hair in her hand, 
and commenced the skilful manipulations which were so 
agreeable to her mistress. "You are losing your health 
in this dull place, madame; no balls, no theatre, no <i>f&ecirc;tes;</i>
surely you will not stay here much longer?"</p>

<p>"My poor Babet," answered Agatha, "I know how 
much you miss your bright Parisian life. Have patience; 
we will go back."</p>

<p>"And will it be soon, madame? I am dying of loneliness 
here."</p>

<p>Agatha was silent. The <i>femme de chambre</i> watched her 
face reflected in the mirror. She made a mental note of 
the fact that madame had retired to her apartment earlier 
than usual; that Miss Eleanor was confined to her bed&mdash;of 
late a common occurrence&mdash;and that M. de Rousy had 
Miss Pitkin all to himself down stairs. All this supplied 
food to her busy brain, and we may fairly presume that 
it was exceedingly nourishing to suspicion.</p>

<p>Agatha suddenly raised her eyes. Babet's small, cunning 
orbs met hers in the mirror before them. She knew 
what they had read on her troubled face. Agatha had 
invested but little belief in human virtue, and in Babet's 
virtue in particular. She knew thoroughly the vulnerable 
points of a French <i>femme de chambre;</i> that truth with 
them is only resorted to when falsehood fails to serve their 

<!-- page 251 -->

purpose. Fidelity means a bargain; the highest bidder 
will always have the better claim to it. They are scornfully 
incredulous of the virtue which starves and refuses 
silk dresses to wrap itself in a threadbare shawl and shabby 
gown. Babet was perhaps no worse than others of her 
class. Cunning, observant, and drawing conclusions 
based upon her experience of life, she was a dangerous 
enemy, and Agatha knew, to her peril, how fatal her infidelity 
might prove to her future security.</p>

<p>"My head is better now, Babet; put up my hair. I 
wish you to look over my dresses to-morrow. I am expecting 
a trunk from Paris; I shall, therefore, not want 
to keep many of the old ones. Make what use of them 
you choose; but you may as well select one of them for 
the pretty girl who comes here with eggs and butter."</p>

<p>Babet had long looked forward to this; nor was she 
surprised that the gift had come this night.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i> how shall I ever thank madame?" she 
said. "Trust me, I will select one of the gayest for Abby. 
She was here to-day while you were away. So innocent! 
as pure and sweet as new milk to look at! But <i>ah, bah!</i>
coquetry is born in woman, and M. Gaston doesn't know 
how to deny himself the pleasure of a walk with a pretty 
girl. Why should he?"</p>

<p>"Why, indeed?" said Agatha, "M. de Rousy must
amuse himself."</p>

<p>"Do you know, madame, that there is a stranger lying 

<!-- page 252 -->

ill at the old place beyond the creek&mdash;I cannot recollect the 
name. A messenger has been sent for Dr. Maribel. A
French woman is his sole companion, and the country 
people declare that he is mad. Far into the night they 
hear the tones of his organ, and they believe that he is 
playing to the ghosts that haunt the old house."</p>

<p>Agatha listened eagerly. She knew now that Oscar 
Featherstone was the inhabitant of his former home.
Everything tended to bring her mind to this conclusion. 
The organ had been brought there for his gratification.
She remembered only too well the words which had 
passed between his father and mother when Mrs. Featherstone, 
from her own purse, had indulged him in a like 
expensive whim. How divinely Oscar had played upon
the instrument, affording the sick woman, perhaps, the only 
real pleasure which she ever enjoyed. A strong, wicked 
hope sprang up in her heart. Oscar was ill. He might 
die! Ah! here she saw her deliverance. He might 
die, and then there would be no risk of recognition&mdash;no 
chance that the old shameful story might be dragged 
from its oblivion&mdash;no fear that Kitty would learn to 
loathe and despise her. She had forgotten Babet's 
presence&mdash;forgotten that the woman's sharp eyes were 
reading her face.</p>

<p>"Madame seems much concerned about the poor gentleman," 
she said, winding the heavy braids around 
Agatha's head.</p>

<!-- page 253 -->

<p>"A stranger without friends is greatly to be pitied, 
Babet."</p>

<p>"Then, madame, shall I go to-morrow and inquire about 
him? I should like also to see Madame Ursule, as they 
call her."</p>

<p>Here was a new danger, one which she had not foreseen. 
Babet must not go. These two women together 
would surely work her a mischief.</p>

<p>"It would be indiscreet while the gentleman is so ill,
Babet. In a few days, when he is better, you may go to 
make a visit to your countrywoman." Oh! how in her 
heart she hoped that Oscar Featherstone might die!</p>

<p>A small open brooch fell to the floor&mdash;she had carelessly 
confined her <i>peignoir</i> with it. Babet picked it up and 
handed it to her.</p>

<p>"Take it Babet," Agatha said, "There is a defect in 
the pin; I can never keep it on. No thanks. Faithful 
service deserves reward. Remember this."</p>

<p>The woman's eyes deepened in their subtle expression
as she glanced covertly into Agatha's face.</p>

<p>"Madame may rely upon my gratitude and fidelity," 
she said, as she was leaving the room.</p>

<p>"Yes," groaned Agatha, when the door had closed behind 
her. "Yes, I may count upon your greed and exactions. 
She knows that I have a secret. God help me!"</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXVII.</p>

<p class="small">"WHY, THEN, THE MAID IS MINE FROM ALL THE WORLD."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the earnest entreaty of Agatha, Kitty had consented 
to pass the night at Worleigh. She had 
read the wish in Gaston's face and dared not 
thwart him. On the plea of fatigue, Agatha retired while
Gaston and Kitty went out on the piazza, attracted thither 
by the beauty of the night&mdash;a summer night with the stars
shining down upon the fructifying earth, and the black 
shadows creeping into mysterious forest depths, where 
dusky forms are stealing with preying intent, and the 
mottled fawn treading timidly in the wake of its antlered 
sire. The feet of the grazing ox sink down into the tender 
grass, and the deep-mouthed hound bays as the belated 
negro swain whistles softly to himself, thinking of his sable 
Dulcinea. Everywhere the whispers of the night&mdash;soft 
echoes dying away down the valleys, where the creek</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Makes sweet music with th' enamel'd stones,<br/>

Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge<br/>

He overtaketh in his pilgrimage."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The great world with its millions of throbbing hearts 

<!-- page 255 -->

and fevered brains&mdash;its millions of human joys and sorrows, 
its millions sleeping in childhood innocence, its 
millions herding with want and crime; the great revolving 
world; pregnant with humanity, was giving rest to her 
weary children&mdash;rest and merciful forgetfulness.</p>

<p>"Will you come with me?" Gaston said, gently placing 
Kitty's hand upon his arm. The night is so fair." 
They walked to and fro the length of the long piazza. 
The "white wonder" of Kitty's hand resting confidingly 
on Gaston's arm. How could she know, innocent child 
that she was, that an exquisite susceptibility to outward 
influences, and the tender sensibility of a loving, untried 
heart are dangerous qualities under the subtle guidance of 
an unscrupulous and unprincipled man.</p>

<p>She listened with pleasurable sensation to the softly 
modulated voice, and her heart began to throb wildly as 
his manner grew more tender.</p>

<p>"How pleasant it is to look at you," he said; "I have 
studied your face so closely that even here in the starlight 
I can read it. Will you permit me? may I tell you what 
I have read there?"</p>

<p>She did not answer, and he went on: "Generous and 
warm in your attachments, there is just enough romance 
in your nature to make you idealize the happy being who 
may be so fortunate as to possess the treasure of your love. 
You are still so young&mdash;so fresh in experience&mdash;so winningly 
ignorant of the world! Ah! I gladly turn from 

<!-- page 256 -->

the remembrance of women who possess all the <i>insouciant</i>
freedom&mdash;the grace and high breeding of the <i>beau monde</i>,
to dwell with pleasure upon your artless modesty&mdash;that 
natural loveliness which few women retain after they have 
brushed away the first bloom of innocence. Shall I continue?" 
he whispered, bending down his face close to 
hers.</p>

<p>No answer was needed. He felt the little hand 
trembling on his arm&mdash;he marked the downcast eyes, the 
quivering lip, and he knew that his victory was well-nigh 
won.</p>

<p>"Catherine," she started and looked up at him. For 
the first time in her life she had been called by her real 
name. "Catherine, do you know that you are really 
beautiful? Through long years of wanderings I have 
never seen a face that I think so perfect in outline, so 
delicately rich in coloring; but it owes its dearest charm 
to the innocence and purity that come from your speaking 
eyes. I believe that you are just as God intended a woman 
to be. Fresh from His hands, I would&mdash;&mdash;" He had 
taken her hand within his own. His words were stayed 
upon his lips. There was something so like desecration 
in touching the soft, white hand that, unprincipled as he 
was, he felt awed in the presence of her virginal modesty. 
"Catherine, dearest;" he continued, "I would take you 
just as you are, and feel myself blessed in your possession.
I have pleaded long; take pity on me, for I love you."</p>

<!-- page 257 -->

<p>She was fascinated by his earnestness, mistaking her 
own heart a fatally as she mistook the character of the 
man. Her pitying womanhood yielded that sympathy 
which caused a tender compliance in her manner&mdash;a 
stronger heart-beat, a rapid uplifting of the eyes, which 
met the passionate glance of De Rousy, and was fatal to 
her self-control. She felt herself powerless to resist, and 
as she stood thus the rapid consciousness of a desire for 
John Maribel's protection came over her, and with it a 
burning, bitter shame as De Rousy caught her in his arms 
and pressed his lips to hers. "You are mine now," he 
whispered exultingly. "Remember what I say to you 
this night, Catherine. You <i>must</i> be my wife."</p>

<p>Wild with awakened remorse and anguish, Kitty tore
herself from his encircling arms and flew to her room.
She believed that she was irrevocably bound to De Rousy, 
and now in the strong revulsion of feeling she loathed 
him so deeply that the kiss which he had impressed upon 
her lips seemed like the brand of shame.</p>

<p>The stars had said good-by to the waking day before 
her sobs grew still.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXIX.</p>

<p class="small">"LET ME QUESTION MORE IN PARTICULAR."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar Featherstone</span> lay in the delirium of 
fever, murmuring names and incoherent phrases&mdash;raving 
of some great heart-sorrow brought 
back to him in fresh poignancy by the excitement of a 
fevered brain. His countenance was shrunken and pale, 
the surface of the body dry and intensely hot, the mouth 
parched, and the pulse frequent and bounding. Dr. Maribel 
knew that, besides a predisposition to febrile excitement, 
there had been an exciting cause in the dampness 
and decomposition of vegetable matter which had accumulated 
about the old place; and that his exposure to the 
miasmatic poison which "loves the ground" had brought 
on the attack. His diagnosis was correct as far as the 
symptoms of intermittent fever were defined; but the 
patient was certainly more prostrated than is usual with 
persons suffering from miasmal fever. There was some 
disturbing influence at work; in all probability, mental 
trouble, and Dr. Maribel determined to question Ursule.</p>

<p>He had at once satisfied her that Mr. Featherstone's 

<!-- page 259 -->

sickness could be traced to natural causes, and that his 
illness was not likely to prove fatal. She was seated now 
in the adjoining room half asleep in the arm-chair; but 
drowsiness lay upon her as lightly as it does upon a cat.
She was wide awake as soon as the Doctor entered the 
room.</p>

<p>"Is something wanted, <i>monsieur? Mon Dieu!</i> how my 
heart beats!"</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, my good woman," answered the Doctor, 
seating himself. "You know that I am in a great measure 
responsible for your master's recovery; but I am hampered 
by my complete ignorance of his habits and disposition, 
and of the circumstances which may act adversely 
towards that recovery. Now, the very principle and root 
of a physician's success is his intimate knowledge of his 
patient's temperament, disposition, and mode of life. 
There is a perfect consistency, therefore, in my desire to 
seek enlightenment and my position towards the patient. 
You understand?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, <i>monsieur</i>. It is clearly my duty to tell you 
all that I know about my dear master." Ursule's broken
language I have converted into intelligible English, as 
being both more agreeable to write and more comprehensible 
to the reader. "It is, I know," she continued, "important 
to his well-being, to relieve his mind of the anxiety 
which has created so much restlessness and despondency 
of late. I feel certain that he has met with some 

<!-- page 260 -->

severe disappointment, and that it is very recent. I
haven't served him for so many years without having 
learned something of his inner life. My master has had 
some great family trouble, and I believe this is the cause 
of his return to this ruined old place. His wanderings
about the country have ended just as I thought they 
would. We must find out his trouble, Doctor, or he will 
die."</p>

<p>"Have you no clue; nothing to guide you to a discovery?" 
asked John Maribel.</p>

<p>"I have but slender material; you may, however, make 
something out of it. Not more than a week ago an 
elderly gentleman and a young lady were riding through 
the woods. They stopped at the spring, and with pleasing
grace she asked for a drink. For days I have puzzled 
over the likeness which I saw in her face&mdash;a likeness 
which I could not trace, and I have vainly tormented myself 
striving to recall some face in the past whose features 
are impressed upon my memory. Yesterday morning 
when my master came creeping into the house at dawn, 
half dead with fatigue, I brought him a cup of coffee. He 
had seated himself and I stood before him. As he raised 
his eyes I saw it all. The same large, dark, tender eyes; 
so luminous, so beautiful!</p>

<p>"Did you tell your master of this likeness?"</p>

<p>"I dared not. It may be that I have been mistaken; 
but I have not been idle. See what I have!"</p>

<!-- page 261 -->

<p>She drew the old letter from her pocket, and opening 
it held it out to John Maribel. There, in faint, 
faded characters, was the name of "Catherine Featherstone."</p>

<p>"I read here," he said, "of Oscar, the son of Catherine 
Featherstone. She writes to her husband of the boy. 
The Featherstones once lived here in opulence. Some 
terrible family disgrace caused the old man to shut up the 
house; and while he tenderly nursed his fortune, he also 
cherished a hatred of mankind, and died bereft of friends, 
and surrounded with the squalor of poverty, which was 
the more horrible because it was unreal. Oscar Featherstone 
has long been supposed to be dead. No one seems 
to know what became of his unfaithful wife, or of her 
child."</p>

<p>Ursule had listened with eager attention; now she 
came quite close to Dr. Maribel, and said: "<i>Tiens!</i> I 
have it. My master is Oscar Featherstone, and he has 
come here looking for his child. I tell you, Doctor, that 
disappointment is killing him. He will die in this old 
place!"</p>

<p>"Not so fast, my good woman. Your master has gone
about his search in a blundering way. He has come back 
under an assumed name, surrounded himself with mystery, 
and has been wandering about the country like a 
beggar, probably putting bits of gossip together, and allowing 
an easy discouragement to take possession of him,

<!-- page 262 -->

and to destroy his energy and his hopes. I feel that 
much depends upon the speedy unravelling of this mystery; 
and shall certainly use my best endeavors to aid
this unfortunate gentleman in obtaining the information 
which may, at least, relieve his mind from harrowing suspense. 
I came here once for the purpose of seeking an 
interview with him. Had he stayed at home, instead of 
risking the chance of taking the ague, he would, in all 
probability, have been put in possession of facts which 
would have been of material benefit in the further prosecution 
of his inquiries."</p>

<p>"You think, then, <i>monsieur</i>, that all is not lost for 
him. You think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think," said John Maribel, "that we must first get 
him through this fever, and then it will be time enough to 
look after his moral malady. In the meantime we must 
be cautious. Remember that the reason, perhaps the life, 
of your master, depends upon your prudence. No one 
must be admitted to his room. You must indulge him in 
any whim which will turn his thoughts away from the 
contemplation of his family troubles, until I have something 
tangible&mdash;some clear facts&mdash;no suppositions. Guard 
against excitement; give him his medicine as directed. I
must go away at daylight, but I will come again to-morrow 
night. I have a long fifteen miles' ride every time I 
come. Take good care of my patient, so that my visits
may not require to be often repeated."</p>

<!-- page 263 -->

<p>When the doctor left his patient at dawn, his pulse had 
become more natural, the delirium had ceased, and he had 
fallen into a tranquil sleep.</p>

<div class="center" id="ch40">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XL.</p>

<p class="small">"BY MEDICINE LIFE MAY BE PROLONGED."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the week of Mr. Featherstone's illness, 
John Maribel had not seen Kitty; but he had 
sent her a note, and received in reply a few constrained 
lines. He carried the little sheet of tinted paper 
in his pocketbook. She had signed herself "Your darling 
Kitty," and for this he had kept the note. To him she 
would always be Kitty; he could have no part in the 
beautiful Catherine Featherstone. There were certain 
things which he could not allow to be open questions; 
some things which he assumed to be indispensable to his 
own moral completeness. It never occurred to him to 
trifle with his soul or his honor, or to run the terrible risk 
of temporizing with either.</p>

<p>While on his way to visit Mr. Featherstone he overtook 
Colonel Covington riding, as was his habit, at a gentle 
pace.</p>

<p>"I suppose you have been to Riverside, Colonel, looking 

<!-- page 264 -->

at the crop," said John, extending his hand to the old 
gentleman.</p>

<p>"Yes, I generally set out by daylight. I can't endure
the sun. How is your patient?"</p>

<p>"Progressing fairly. I hope soon to have him on his 
legs again; but his constitution is frail, and he is laboring
under great mental depression."</p>

<p>"I hear that he is a foreigner," said Colonel Covington.
"Is it not somewhat singular that a stranger should have 
come to this quiet neighborhood and chosen that ruinous 
old place as his residence."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered John, "and one cannot help surmising 
that his choice of residence was dictated by a motive, 
which I think must also influence his eccentric conduct. 
A casual observer might easily mistake his peculiar idiosyncrasies 
for the vagaries of an unsound mind; but he 
is simply an unhappy being, who has taken much to 
heart some family trouble."</p>

<p>"Well, the case is more serious than I thought, Doctor; 
but if a little neighborly kindness can in any way 
comfort him, I am sure Mrs. Covington will be only too 
glad to be of service. Nobody is better in a sick-room, 
or more in their element, than she is when she is permitted 
to coddle a patient; but I rather think that 
she prefers convalescents whom she can feed freely 
with broths and jellies. I shall do myself the pleasure
of calling as soon as I have your permission, provided 

<!-- page 265 -->

your recluse does not abjure the society of his neighbors."</p>

<p>"I flatter myself," said John, "that I have discovered a 
mode of moral treatment which will restore Mr. Pultney 
to a more natural and happy condition of mind. I will be 
much disappointed should he not welcome you most 
heartily, sir, when you do him the honor to visit him."</p>

<p>"I tell you, Maribel," and Colonel Covington turned 
in his saddle and looked at John, "that if I didn't believe 
that Oscar Featherstone was dead, I should say that <i>he is
the man</i>. Well do I remember him as a boy&mdash;a shy, 
sensitive youngster, the darling of a foolish, doting 
mother, and antagonistic at every point to his father, who 
would have had him shoulder his way through the world, 
instead of spending his time playing the organ and cultivating 
art, which was to him an absorbing, intellectual 
enjoyment. We really have no positive evidence of 
Oscar's death. It is one of those things which people 
have accepted without question; possibly, because it does 
not readily occur to them that a living man could voluntarily 
throw up a fine inheritance."</p>

<p>"Then his death is a mere hypothesis, based upon a 
one-sided mode of reasoning," replied John.</p>

<p>"God bless my soul! Doctor," exclaimed Colonel Covington, 
"what are we coming to?"</p>

<p>"Merely to the other side of the question," replied 
John Maribel. "It seems that young Featherstone 

<!-- page 266 -->

possessed a highly imaginative temperament and a most 
unpractical turn of mind. Now, to a man leading a
purely ideal life, and to whom the contemplation of the 
highest orders of genius gave a standard which would 
make him painfully alive to anything which might lower 
him in his own estimation, or disgrace him in the eyes of 
the world, the renunciation of his father's wealth is really 
not so surprising."</p>

<p>"Then you suspect that Oscar Featherstone lives?" 
said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"Take my surmises, Colonel, for what they are worth. 
You know that I am deeply concerned in Kitty's welfare, 
and that from the fact of her having been confided to my 
care by old Featherstone, I have always imagined that the 
time would come when the matter would be cleared up,
and she would have her right position in the world."</p> 

<p>"Most heartily will I join you, Doctor, in bringing this 
about. Kitty is the sweetest and dearest of girls, and we 
must look well after her."</p>

<p>The roads separated here, and they parted, both of them
with hearts full of anxious thought and deep concern for 
the future of sweet Kitty Pitkin. In a few days, Mr. 
Smiley had informed John Maribel, Kitty would be of 
age; and on that day of her majority she would be put in 
possession of certain facts relating to her family. On this 
day John Maribel would go to Mr. Featherstone&mdash;of 
whose identity he scarcely entertained a doubt&mdash;and give 

<!-- page 267 -->

him the intelligence which would relieve his heart of 
harassing suspense, and would prove a better elixir than 
all the tonics which "tone and invigorate the system, 
dispel gloom, and rejuvenate the <i>entire</i> man."</p>

<p>He was slowly retracing his way back to town, his 
bridle lay loosely on the neck of his horse, his heart filled 
with those thoughts which come in hours of contemplation, 
bringing back to it the mysterious rapture which 
sometimes, even amidst the world's hard realities, thrills 
the soul like a divine <i>fugue</i>, alternating its delicious 
melody with the joyous treble of happiness and the solemn 
bass of deeper and more anxious feeling. The hard-working, 
middle-aged doctor was actually allowing himself to 
dream of what might have been&mdash;to picture to himself a 
fair young life linked to his&mdash;to grow tender in the contemplation 
of this delightful picture, when, as it often 
happens, the reaction was at hand. A most unpleasant 
reality awaited him at the turn of the road. Directly 
before him two persons were walking&mdash;a man and a 
woman. His horse was already within a few yards of 
them, when with undisguised haste they withdrew into 
the denser shadow of the trees which bordered the road. 
John had stayed a longer time than usual with Mr. 
Featherstone, so that he was late returning. By the fading 
twilight he caught sight of the girl's white face and recognized 
Abby Blackwell. The slight, elegant figure by her 
side was certainly not that of Perry Deane. Remembering

<!-- page 268 -->

Perry's altered looks, and associating these with the 
fact that he had not seen him since their meeting by the 
creek, he deduced a conclusion which caused him real 
pain. It was one of John Maribel's best characteristics 
that he could put aside self and enter largely into the 
troubles of others, and as he rode on he thought of his 
humble friend's heart-sorrow with a dim foreboding of 
what its consequences might be to him.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XLI.</p>

<p class="small">"WOULD IT NOT MAKE ONE WEEP?"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A half</span> consumed light-wood knot smouldered on 
the hearth of the farm kitchen; now and then 
the flame catching the resin in the wood, would 
shoot up into momentary brightness and then die away, 
leaving the room in demi-obscurity.</p>

<p>Jope sat on a low stool close beside the chimney, leaning 
his head against the mantelpiece. He was sitting there 
ostensibly to keep the pot of coffee from boiling over; 
for Blackwell and his wife had gone to a prayer-meeting, 
and Abby, as we have seen, was hiding in guilty terror 

<!-- page 269 -->

under the black shadows by the road-side. Jope was 
vexing himself now over the question of his future prospects. 
He had pursued towards his uncle a conciliatory 
course of conduct, prompted not so much by a desire to 
please the old man, as by a motive which lay deeper and 
which was, indeed, the moving power of all his actions&mdash;his 
humble devotion to Kitty. Conciliation, however, is 
not abandonment of principle; and Jope thought often 
with regret, as he practised his steps on the barn floor, of 
the waste of talent, the loss of opportunity and the weary 
sameness of his farm-work. If he had delivered himself up 
to the special pleading of his absorbing passion he would 
have made up his bundle and once more braved the ire of 
Uncle Mark; but Jope, with no very marked faculty of 
observation, was nevertheless in possession of certain facts 
which he turned about in his mind, arriving at last, by 
the slow process of reasoning, at conclusions which could 
not have been juster had they been evolved by the most 
accomplished logician.</p>

<p>However incompatible selfishness may be with the rigid 
carrying out of Solomon's teachings, it was, I am sorry to 
say, a strong ingredient of Mark Blackwell's character.
It had been Jope's misfortune all his life to be quietly 
taken possession of and manipulated without the slightest 
regard to his claims to more generous treatment. There 
seemed to be work ever ready at hand for him, and if it
was any satisfaction to him to know it, he never ate the 

<!-- page 270 -->

bread of idleness, or lay down at night to moralize over 
misspent time. He generally went to sleep too thoroughly 
tired even to give a reproachful thought to his exacting 
uncle.</p>

<p>He had returned from town that morning, having gone 
thither the night before to take some farm produce to 
market. Profiting by this occasion he made a visit to 
Nellie Shea at Doctor Maribel's back gate.</p>

<p>"You mind what I say to you, Jope Perkins," Miss
Shea had said, as she warmed over the family affairs.
"Things is going every which way with Doctor John. 
Never a downright decent meal has he eat since Miss
Kitty's been away. Is it any wonder for a man to grow 
thin on cold vituals? And there's Mrs. Parrot, as cross 
as over was, and counting the lumps of sugar as if Doctor 
John couldn't afford to buy the best superfine by the 
barrel, and having a strange woman stealing in here as 
never was a ghost, if she'd swear to it on the Bible."</p>

<p>"Nellie," remarked Jope, in rather an insinuating way, 
"you know my weakness where woman is concerned. I've 
got an unfortunate soft heart."</p>

<p>This declaration was not without its effect upon Miss 
Shea. She moved a little nearer to Jope, and looked at 
him with an air of expectancy.</p>

<p>"Yes, I may say," continued Jope, "that I have 
injured my own prospects by letting myself run&mdash;if I 
may use a figure&mdash;into sugar and water, when I ought to 

<!-- page 271 -->

have gone into sinew and muscle. Yes, Nellie, I believe 
that sinew and muscle would have been the making of 
me; and instead of getting a name for myself, I am only 
catching the dew and the sun, and Uncle Mark's ding-dong 
about Solomon, as I wish no such man had ever set 
himself up for a model. I take it, it was a good while ago 
as he said them things. The world's got around pretty 
often since then; but, as I was a saying, I've stood in my 
own light all along of my softness towards them as I 
love better than myself."</p>

<p>He paused and looked at Nellie. Now Nellie was
what Mrs. Parrott called an archetypal old maid; one of 
those, who&mdash;to use a quaint, foreign saying&mdash;was doomed 
to comb St. Catharine's hair. These maidens are proverbially 
susceptible, and are ever dreaming of hypothetical 
husbands. Nellie was no exception to the rule. Although 
she had never associated Jope with ideas of marital 
felicity, she very naturally applied his remarks to 
herself, and was fairly falling into a sympathetic softness, 
which kept her silent now, causing her to assume a conscious 
air, and to forget that Mrs. Parrott was waiting 
for her tea.</p>

<p>"I can't exactly see what's come over you, Nellie," 
said the innocent Jope. "I never seen you before when 
you didn't have a word that was ready to come out, just 
as if it had been hanging on to the end of your tongue, 
awaiting the chance to slip off. However, I may as well 

<!-- page 272 -->

say that I came here to-night to talk to you in a particular 
and confidential way. You and I has known each other 
this long while, Nell, and I believe as how you can be 
trusted."</p>

<p>"Who, if not me?" Nellie moved a little nearer. 
"Trusted, as never was, Jope. I tell you if Nellie Shea 
don't know how to make a penny grow, nobody does. 
I say penny, just as a kind of a figure, Jope, like the sugar 
and water&mdash;for we don't have them, you know. I've got 
a ready ear and a still tongue, Jope, and a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A what, Nellie?"</p>

<p>"A&mdash;a&mdash;loving heart, Jope, as don't take no account 
of being a few years older. Years don't mean 
nothing with a woman as can be trusted and has got a 
head for saving."</p>

<p>"What on the earth do you mean?" exclaimed poor 
Jope, taking a step backward and instinctively drawing 
himself far as possible from Nellie's arms. A love of 
liberty urged him to this ungallant action.</p>

<p>"What do I mean?" shrieked the furious woman. 
"I mean that you are an imperent, false-tongued noddle-head, 
as you always was&mdash;the <i>noddlest</i> of heads&mdash;as come 
to back gates enticing of innocent women to lose their 
characters, talking with two sides to your words, and trying 
to deceive a lone woman."</p>

<p>"It's you that are a deceiving of yourself, Miss Shea, 
and if I talk with two sides to my words&mdash;which I didn't 

<!-- page 273 -->

know before, and much obliged for the information&mdash;why, 
you have got at the wrong side, that's all. I have been 
talking about her as I would have her to walk over my 
dead body and take it kindly of her, and have suffered 
imposings and suspection as never a young man put up 
with, and you&mdash;why, what do you take me for, Nellie
Shea, to be coming spooney over you, as might have been 
my mother, or at least my oldest aunt, with such stuff
and nonsense as I'd be ashamed to be guilty of?"</p>

<p>He had gradually receded as he talked until he had 
placed a safe distance between himself and the mortified 
and indignant Nellie.</p>

<p>"You poor, pitiful object," she hissed at him. "You 
double-faced villain! oh! oh! oh!" She let off these interjections 
like pistol-shots, as if she intended each one to 
strike him to the heart; and it certainly was not her 
fault if he did not fall down there dead before Dr. Maribel's 
gate, an edifying example to young men who talk 
with two sides to their words. Jope was very hot and 
uncomfortable as he thought over this scene now in the 
dim kitchen, with the old clock going tick-tack, tick-tack, 
over his head. "Oh!" he thought, "a poor, foolish boy 
like me, is always a blundering when he means to do 
right!"</p> 

<p>He rose to his feet, and turning round was face to face 
with Abby, who had come softly in at the door.</p>

<p>"Did I frighten you, Jope?"</p>

<!-- page 274 -->

<p>"Your comings and goings ain't much to be calculated 
on these days, Abby," he answered.</p>

<p>"Jope," she said, quite humbly, "don't you be saying 
anything, or casting blame on me, not at least to-night, I 
can't stand it."</p>

<p>She sat down on the settle, and throwing her apron 
over her head, burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Whatever has happened to you, Abby?" said Jope, 
moved by her low sobbing. "I'm your own cousin, and 
you needn't keep anything from me, leastways, anything
that I can help you in. Is it something you're got on
your mind, as you'd like to speak to a friend about, as is 
a real, true friend to you, Abby?"</p>

<p>"My heart will just burst, Jope," she answered, uncovering 
her face. "Oh, Jope, I'm that troubled that I 
don't know what to do. You'll help your poor cousin, 
won't you, Jope?"</p>

<p>"As God is my witness, I will, Abby; only tell me 
what I can do for you."</p>

<p>"It isn't much that anybody can do," she answered between 
her sobs, "Perry hasn't come here since last 
Sunday, Jope. We had some words together. I thought 
he wanted to be masterful with me. I didn't behave well, 
and I've been going wrong, I know I have, listening to 
idle words and a lying tongue&mdash;and it was all for trash 
like this!" She dragged the ruby ring from her finger, 
and dashed it into the farthest corner of the kitchen.

<!-- page 275 -->

I shut my ears to father's warnings and mother's advice.
My poor, poor, old mother! and, oh! Jope, I've lost my
good name forever. I swear to you that I don't deserve 
it; but I've lost it, Jope, and Perry will hear of it, and 
I'm undone!"</p>

<p>Jope stood looking at the wretched girl, his face livid 
with agitation, and he was trembling in every limb.
"Abby," he said, "tell me again that you've done nothing 
worse than to listen to a lying tongue, and I'll believe 
you&mdash;tell me again, Abby. You've no call to deceive me, 
your own cousin."</p>

<p>"I've been foolish, Jope&mdash;foolish, and weak, and wicked 
as can be, and I know that I've lost an honest man's love, 
as has always dealt fair and honorable by me. I'll tell 
you the truth, Jope. I was down by the creek to-night. 
I oughtn't to have gone, but I was led on like. You know 
who I went there to meet&mdash;you and everybody else knows.
We was walking&mdash;just walking along the road, Jope, 
and I was uneasy and sorry that I had come, and he told 
me that he couldn't come again, and made me promise to 
make up with Perry, and said other things, Jope, as I 
shouldn't a listened to, because I am promised to a good 
man&mdash;a good and true man as ever was, Jope, and as we 
was walking, Dr. Maribel passed by and, oh, my God! he 
saw me. It seems to me now that I can see his horrified 
face; he is Perry's best friend. Perry thinks there never 
was anybody like him. I've told you all the truth, Jope&mdash;every 

<!-- page 276 -->

word just as it happened, only I have not said 
that the villain wanted to buy me off not to say anything 
that Kitty Pitkin could hear; he wanted to buy me off, 
Jope, after he has taken away my good name and ruined 
me forever. Don't you see, Jope," she moaned, walking 
to and fro, swinging her hands, "don't you see that I'm 
forever undone, for nobody is a going to believe me but 
you. <i>You</i> do, don't you, Jope?"</p>

<p>Poor fellow, he was quite bewildered with grief and 
consternation; but in his own simple, downright reasoning 
he began to see that there was but one way out of 
Abby's difficulties, and this entailed on her part a most 
mortifying and humiliating confession. He believed in 
her sincere repentance, and he believed also that her grief
must touch Perry's heart and obtain his forgiveness, 
taking for granted that she would tell him the truth. So
he said to her: "I will do the best I can for you, Abby; 
I'll try to set things right, if it can be done. Don't you 
fret and go on so dreadful. I can't keep my feelings 
under, and my head is whirling as if I was hanging over 
some awful precipice, and was struggling to keep from 
falling into the black gulf below."</p>

<p>"Things is so wrong with me, Jope," said Abby, "so
wrong that I don't see as anybody can help me; and 
there's father! Oh, if Perry casts me off, he'll never forgive 
me!"</p>

<p>"It's no use a making of yourself sick with fretting, 

<!-- page 277 -->

Abby. Go to bed and try to make yourself easy. I've 
always found that it is comforting-like to remember that 
we have a Father who takes account of His children. 
Just you ask of Him, Abby, to do something for you. I'll 
go over to Oaklands at daylight and see Perry. He loves 
you, Abby, and won't be too hard on you. You must ask 
his forgiveness and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Jope, I could never, never do that. The shame 
of telling him would kill me. He is the kind of man as 
has straight notions about the way a girl should keep faith
with the man as she's promised to, and he wouldn't believe
me, not if I swore to him on my knees that it was all for 
love of finery, and that I love him better than the grandest 
gentleman as ever was."</p>

<p>The shutting of the gate warned her of the approach of 
her parents, and escaping to her room upstairs, she heard 
them come in and ask anxiously about her.</p>

<p>Jope told them that she was tired from her day's ironing 
and had gone to bed.</p>

<!-- page 278 -->

<div class="center" id="ch42">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XLII.</p>

<p class="small">"DROWNED! OH, WHERE?"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jope</span> crept down stairs while it was still starlight.
Going to the stable he saddled Brown Betty, 
and cautiously opening the barn gate, mounted 
her and rode away with a heavy heart and a mind sorely 
at ease. He know that Perry held strong views about 
honorable dealing; that he chose no middle ground between 
right and wrong, and that his anger against Abby 
was justified by his outraged love. In his simple mind 
there were two extremes necessarily opposed to each other&mdash;a 
courageous determination to help his cousin, and a 
faltering dread of his inability to plead her cause, which 
he knew to be a weak one. Riding along in the chill 
dawn, with the gloom of a gathering storm hanging like a
pall about him, he almost repented him of his promise to 
Abby.</p>

<p>When he reached Oaklands the rain was pouring in a 
steady torrent. Sabra, the cook, espied him and cried to
him, as she stood at the kitchen door: "Lord bless you, 
Mr. Perkins! You is drenched; to be sure. Come right in 
and dry yourself, I'll have a cup of coffee ready in a 

<!-- page 279 -->

minute. Never mind the floor, that can be wiped up;
but it ain't so easy getting the ague cured when it takes 
the right hold on you, and the rheumatics creeps into the 
marrow of your bones with the damp."</p>

<p>Jope gratefully accepted the cup of coffee, and unheeding 
the danger of ague said that he would go at once to 
look for Perry.</p>

<p>"You ain't come here to see Mr. Deane?" exclaimed 
Sabra, with a look of astonishment. "Why, he's gone
away."</p>

<p>Jope's heart sank. "Gone away, Sabra? Particular 
business brought me here this morning, and you say he's 
gone away?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and de Lord only knows where he's gone to. 
Master is mightily worried about him; for you see he's 
the sort of man as people takes to, but he ain't bin like 
himself sence a while back. He's done give up the job 
here, and another man has come in his place. It seems
like nobody dunno where he's gone to."</p>

<p>"I am much obliged to you, Sabra," answered Jope, too 
sick at heart to question her further.  "Good-day to you;
I'll be getting back to Hillside."</p> 

<p>"You ain't crazy, Mr. Perkins, to start in this rain;
and breakfast is most ready?"</p>

<p>"I must be off, Sabra. Uncle will be worrying about 
the mare."</p>

<p>In spite of the increasing storm he set out for home.

<!-- page 280 -->

The hissing rain drove into his face, half blinding him, 
while rushing torrents swept down the hill-sides, wearing 
the yielding earth into deep gullies. Setting spurs to the 
mare he urged her to greater speed, and the brave animal, 
with ears set back and eyes dilated, moved onward through 
the storm. The creek which separated Hillside from Worleigh 
was a broad, shallow stream, fordable during the 
most part of the year, but likely to swell into a formidable 
torrent when during the sudden and violent rain-storms 
common in the summer season it received from its tributaries 
their overplus of water. As the torrent subsided 
as suddenly as it rose, it had not been thought worth while 
to make a substantial bridge. Present security often 
arrogates authority over prudent foresight. So a slight 
structure only had been thrown across for the convenience 
of the neighborhood. This had now completely disappeared. 
Jope saw with dismay the volume of rushing 
water, swift and turbid, carrying everything before it in 
its irresistible course. The mare shivered and stuck her 
feet into the earth with a determination which expressed 
her unwillingness to plunge into the angry flood; 
and Jope was far from contemplating an act of heroic folly 
which would have given me an opportunity of describing 
the dying struggles of Brown Betty and the miraculous 
escape of her rider. No, as every sensible person would 
have acted under the circumstances, Jope determined to 
go back to Worleigh and wait there until the ford became 

<!-- page 281 -->

passable. He tightened rein and touched the mare with 
the spur; but as she sprang forward he drew her up suddenly 
and leaped to the ground.</p>

<p>A great cry went out through the forest&mdash;a cry that 
rose above the sullen roar of the water and the noise of 
the storm.</p>

<p>Jope had seen the white face, the long floating hair, and 
the garments of a woman borne swiftly down the stream. 
An appalling dread stunned him for a moment; and then 
he ran along the bank striving to catch a glimpse of the 
figure, intending without thought of risk to his own life 
to attempt the rescue of the unfortunate woman. He ran, 
falling to the earth when his feet became entangled in the 
trailing vines or protruding roots, then rising with desperate 
haste to continue his arduous course. In the meantime 
the rapid torrent had borne the woman onward, and 
he had lost sight of her.</p>

<p>About a quarter of a mile from the ford the creek made 
a curve, and a great sand-bank jutting out formed a sort 
of promontory. Against this the current had carried a 
quantity of drift-wood. There, caught in an intricate network 
of roots and branches&mdash;there, with her long hair 
floating on the water, her white breast bared, and the 
cruel flood lashing her tender limbs&mdash;there Jope saw his 
cousin Abby. She was dead; but oh! the cruel, cruel 
sight! Alone he could not extricate her, and where was 
he to look for help. He might go to seek it, but could he 

<!-- page 282 -->

leave her there? "Oh, my God! my God!" he prayed, 
"send me some help? Must I stand here and see her 
mangled and torn to pieces. Abby, my poor Abby!"</p>

<p>He shouted for help, he prayed to God, and he waited. 
In answer to his prayers he heard a far-off response, then 
minutes like lagging hours dragged by, until he saw a 
figure emerge from the woods on the opposite bank. To 
this side the current had taken the unfortunate girl. The 
man wore no hat, his soaked garments clung to his emaciated 
form, and wild, haggard eyes looked out from a 
mass of tangled beard and hair. In this wild, desperate-looking 
figure; Jope recognized Perry Deane.</p>

<p>He did not at first see the dead girl. He was looking 
across at Jope; but his eyes followed the boy's horrified
gaze and fell upon Abby. Then a frenzy seemed to possess 
him. He could reach her from where he stood by 
stooping forward; but the drift had jammed her firmly 
in the network of logs and roots, and branches ladened 
with soddened moss, and it was only by superhuman effort 
that she could be extricated. Plunging into the water, he 
tore away the interlacing mass, and lifting her in his brawny 
arms, with a mighty effort bore her to the bank. Kneeling 
beside her tenderly, with trembling hands he drew 
together the remnants of her garments, turning away his 
head while he covered her bare, snowy breast with the 
coat which he had taken off.</p>

<p>His face was fixed and hard. Jope shuddered as he 

<!-- page 283 -->

watched him. Not moan, not a tear, as he bent over 
her livid face, and closed the great staring eyes. He
grasped for a moment the cold, limp hand, and saw that 
the ruby ring was gone; his own golden circlet was there
instead.</p>

<p>There was a break in the dull sky; the storm was 
abating. Jope bethought him that about two miles further 
down the stream on the public road a substantial 
bridge spanned it, and as its timbers were stout, it had, 
in all probability, withstood the storm. If he could cross 
there it would take him but a short time to get to Hillside. 
To his great joy he found the bridge standing.
The water was level with the arch, and the flooring on each
side was covered to the distance of several feet.  He advanced 
cautiously, holding by the railing, and at every 
step expecting the trembling structure to give way under 
his feet. The passage being safely performed, he set out 
at a brisk pace towards Hillside. Retracing his way up 
the creek, and cutting across the woods at the nearest 
point, he soon&mdash;too soon, found himself breathless and exhausted 
at his uncle's gate.</p>

<p>Blackwell had that morning, with unwonted indulgence, 
permitted Abby to rest undisturbed. "Young folks love 
to sleep, mother," he said, "and it's no harm giving them 
a chance now and then. There's not much to do on such 
a morning."</p>

<p>Black Sam came running in to tell the old man that 

<!-- page 284 -->

Jope had taken the mare. The fear of loss aroused 
a lurking fiend in the heart of Mark Blackwell, and he 
exclaimed in the hard, decided tone of a man who is not 
in the habit of allowing charity to impugn the quality of 
his judgment, "He's off again, wife, and this time the 
rascal has taken my best horse." The hours wore away, and 
she, whom they believed to be sleeping upstairs in the 
sound, sweet slumber of girlhood, was being torn and 
lacerated in the boiling flood. She, who so few days before 
rejoiced in the exuberant beauty of her eighteen 
years, lay with her wet garments clinging to her rounded 
limbs, her auburn hair soaked and matted, her features 
marred by the cruel manner of her death. I will not attempt 
to describe the scene which followed. The depths 
of a voiceless grief are hidden from the looker-on. It has 
many phases; but perhaps the darkest of all is when the 
possibility of good which is to be the fruition of his trial 
is shut out from the heart of man, when he is blind to 
God's love, defiant and unreconciled to the treatment 
which he has met with at His hands.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XLIII.</p>

<p class="small">"DEAD, ART THOU DEAD?&mdash;ALACK! MY CHILD IS DEAD!"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Men</span> gathered in groups about the door of Blackwell's 
house, while the weeping women crowded 
the room where the body of the unfortunate 
girl was laid out, and where the wretched father sat with 
bowed head, and features set in an expression of sombre 
despair. The stain upon his child's fair name, the horrible 
and mysterious manner of her death, created in his 
mind a tumult of hard, bitter self-reproach, which, mingled 
with wild regret at her loss, and a burning desire for 
vengeance, had well nigh unsettled his intellect. Meantime, 
the preparations for Abby's interment were completed. 
The coffin was borne before the tottering old 
man to the grave, which had been dug in a corner of the 
church-yard. John Maribel, with pale and grief-stricken 
face, had joined him at the gate, and placed his arm within 
his own. This act of friendly sympathy moved him as
the words of consolation which had been poured into his 
ears for the last few hours had failed to do. Tears&mdash;blessed 
tears&mdash;coursed down his furrowed cheeks, while his large 

<!-- page 286 -->

frame shook and quivered as sobs and groans burst from
his agonized heart.</p>

<p>While the coffin was being lowered into the grave, and 
friends and neighbors stood in mournful silence awaiting 
that solemn realization of mortality which is conveyed to 
the senses with vivid and awful significance by the dull, 
hollow thud of that first spadeful of earth falling upon the 
coffin-lid, Blackwell started forward, and, raising his 
trembling hands to heaven, exclaimed, in the words of 
divine pity:</p>

<p>"Father, forgive her, for she knew not what she did!"</p>

<p>A fervent "Amen" fell from the lips of the bystanders 
and, sustained by this outburst of sympathy, the wretched 
father remained beside the grave until a mound of earth
was all that marked the resting-place of her whose beauty 
had been the talk of all the country-side, and whose terrible 
death afforded a theme for special prayers that 
night in many a country home&mdash;prayers that went straight 
to God, purified by the incense of charity, and pleading 
eloquently for the erring girl. There were other prayers 
which miscarried on their heavenward journey&mdash;dead 
prayers, which were but the outbursts of self-congratulatory 
satisfaction, and whose "Amens" were but the 
epitome of human conceit and hypocrisy. The heart of 
man has not changed since the Pharisee thanked God 
that he was not as other men. The Evangelist tells us 
that he prayed "thus with himself," conveying in these 

<!-- page 287 -->

simple words all that need be said as to the efficacy of such 
supplications.</p>

<p>Jerusha Brown, a neighbor and connection, had stayed 
at home with the half-crazed mother, and when she saw 
Blackwell alighting from the wagon at the farm-gate, she 
ran forward to meet him; but as she caught sight of his 
face a great fear came over her.</p>

<p>"Uncle Mark," she cried, "Uncle Mark!"</p>

<p>He paused, stretching out his hands toward the desolate 
home, and in a deep, solemn voice, said:</p>

<p>"The eye also which saw her shall see her no more; 
neither shall her place any more behold her."</p>

<p>Jerusha stood for a minute gazing at the stricken old man 
as if trying to take in the awful meaning of his scriptural 
quotation; then, with a loud sob, she threw her apron over 
her face, and sinking on a bench beside the door, moaned 
and wept, rocking herself to and fro, as if keeping
measure to her sobs.</p>

<p>To a man like Blackwell the loss of his respectability 
was a crushing blow; for poor Abby's giddiness and 
imprudence had, as is the common practice of the world, 
been perverted into a serious dereliction from duty; and 
the manner of her death helped to give reason to uncharitableness.</p>

<p>He who had ever walked uprightly before men must 
bow his gray head now to the very dust; he whose words 
were listened to with reverent respect, whose opinions 

<!-- page 288 -->

were sought by old and young, must keep silent now; 
for the name of Blackwell would be a by-word in all the 
country, and the finger of scorn would be pointed at the 
man who had failed to carry out in his own family the 
severe precepts which he gave to others&mdash;who had failed 
to see the pitfall at his own door, while he warned others 
of their danger, and had allowed his own child to walk 
into the jaws of a dishonored death, stubbornly believing 
that the ramparts of respectability which he had reared 
around his family were impregnable. While his eyes 
were fixed upon the solid heights which years of probity 
and uprightness had raised above him, the enemy had 
secretly undermined his foundations, and he stood humbled
and stricken amid his ruins.</p>

<p>Perhaps young Goodman Brown was not more astonished 
at seeing Deacon Gookin in questionable company, 
than was this stern old man to find, when through the 
sanctifying influence of his deep grief, the veil of self-confidence 
was torn from his eyes, that for many long years 
he had been quietly faring along with the same dark 
companion, complacently satisfied with his Bible knowledge 
and the ready expounding of texts the very spirit of 
which he did not understand. Here I may say that
Mark Blackwell's case is by no means an isolated instance 
of that species of self-deceit which lurks in dangerous 
proximity to religious observance. The subtle working of 
certain outward influences towards a respectable kind of 

<!-- page 289 -->

hypocrisy, which imposes no less upon the person himself 
than upon the world in general, is perhaps but a sequence 
of human proneness to deceit and its liability to fall into 
sin. When a man begins to see that he has been carrying 
out a cunning plot of the devil&mdash;that his doctrine, to him 
at least, has been but an ingenious hypothesis framed to 
trace the footprints of worldly observance, instead of the 
true essence of godliness, then he has a hard battle to fight, 
and wins it, to find himself bleeding and bruised, crying 
out for mercy, thirsting, for the first time, for the water 
of life, "clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of 
God and of the Lamb."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> grave-digger threw down his spade and shovel 
beside the damp mound which covered all that 
was mortal of Abby Blackwell, as is customary 
with negroes, who always leave their implements beside a 
newly-made grave. Whistling a solemn hymn-tune the 
man walked down the road towards the mill; and when 

<!-- page 290 -->

he was well out of sight, Perry Deane, coming from 
the opposite direction, paused a moment, looking carefully 
about him, and then entered the church-yard.</p>

<p>Long shadows were creeping over the graves, and the 
tall column with its broken shaft looked like a gigantic 
sentinel guarding the homes of the dead. Perry went 
straight to the lonely corner where they had laid Abby.</p>

<p>He stood looking at the grave, uttering no word, nor 
sob, nor sigh. Now moving a few steps nearer, now 
making a retrograde motion, as if under the spell of 
some horrible fascination. In his movements his foot 
struck against the spade, and, as if this accident had 
exerted some humanizing influence, or, at least, had led 
him to an idea which would give activity to a hitherto 
lurking impulse, he seized it and commenced cutting away 
and shaping the mound, smoothing and rounding it with 
deliberate care. This done, he cut out squares of sod and
proceeded to cover the grave with them, and then cleared 
away the weeds and lumps of earth thrown out in the digging. 
His work completed, he stood contemplating it 
with the same hard gaze in his tearless eyes&mdash;a dumb, despairing 
grief which could find no outlet.</p>

<p>"All the passions," saith an old writer, "are such near 
neighbors that if one of them is on fire, the others should 
send buckets." The passion of hate is often stimulated to 
work its direst mischief by the fuel fed to it by outraged 
and disappointed love. As Perry stood there beside 

<!-- page 291 -->

Abby's grave, he was perhaps alive but to one mastering 
impulse, and that was a desire for speedy vengeance. His 
love lay buried beneath the sod at his feet; but the burning 
hate which maddened his brain had an object upon 
which to expend itself.</p>

<p>For months he had been under the influence of one of 
those passions that sometimes take possession of a heart, 
seeming in its violence to be indemnifying itself for loss of 
time. Love in middle age dies hard. In youth it is a 
fever, hot and throbbing while it lasts, but yielding readily 
to treatment and leaving the patient no worse for the 
paroxysm. In middle age its symptoms are insidious and 
deep-seated. In many cases they predominate over other 
phenomena, and instead of being symptoms, really become 
a disease.</p>

<p>In Perry's case it had slowly yielded to the lancinating 
agony of suspicion; but the deep wrong which he had suffered 
was almost forgotten in the greater harm which had 
befallen the young girl who was to have been his wife. 
She lay there in the foulsome grave, hid away forever from 
his sight. A deep sense of injustice hardened his heart 
into defiant grief.</p>

<p>The shadows grew blacker and the gloaming faded into 
night. Like one blind, the miserable man walked away, 
stumbling over the graves and never once looking behind 
him. He took the road to Worleigh.</p>

<p>The flood of the day before had swept away the fence 

<!-- page 292 -->

and inundated the lower portion of the grounds. The 
earth was still wet and yielding; but the creek, so lately 
a raging torrent, was now scarce a foot deep. Perry 
dashed into the stream and waded across. On reaching 
the opposite bank he walked straight on, never pausing or 
looking about him, as if in doubt about what he intended 
doing.</p>

<p>The library, which was situated in the left wing of the 
house, had been added to the main building by the present 
possessor. It was a handsome apartment, parallelogram-shaped 
with windows coming down to the floor, and the 
ceiling consisting of a broad, flat panel in the centre was 
surrounded with a frescoed border.</p>

<p>Bookcases, pictures, busts, and all the <i>bimbeloterie couteuse</i> 
that a man who has taste for such things and money 
to gratify it can so easily accumulate, filled the room. A
lamp hung from the ceiling casting its soft light over carving 
and bronzes and pictures. In the midst of this luxury, 
seated on a low chair, was Kitty with folded hands 
and downcast eyes looking grieved and troubled.</p>

<p>Perry saw her from where he stood; he took in every 
detail of her figure&mdash;the white dress with the delicate lace 
about the throat, the small hands, the coils of blond 
hair, and even the slippered foot just showing beneath the 
hem of her dress. He was trying to identify this graceful, 
elegant figure with Mother Pitkin's blithesome darling, and 
as he gazed, a hard pain caught at his heart, rising in his 

<!-- page 293 -->

throat, and taking away his breath. The possibility of 
great heart-sorrow had never associated itself in his mind 
with John Maribel; now, familiarized with its acutest 
pangs, he comprehended what might be in store for this 
man whom he loved, and whose generous, unselfish nature
would accept uncomplainingly the pain of a bitter disappointment. 
He carried in his breast pocket the means of 
wreaking vengeance upon the man who had wronged him&mdash;who 
had turned aside the current of a decent and respectable 
life and caused him at that moment to be prowling in
a gentleman's grounds with the intent of a midnight
assassin; but even as he looked, the subtle influence of 
noble example created in his darkened mind a reaching 
upward scarcely defined, yet sufficiently palpable to arouse 
a sense of generosity towards the young and innocent 
being whose life might be saddened by the action which 
he contemplated. Subjugated by impulses, which were 
strong, counterbalancing weights thrown into the scale 
with his fierce anger and burning desire for vengeance, he 
turned and walked away.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XLV.</p>

<p class="small">"FYE ON THEE! I CAN TELL WHAT THOU WOULDST DO."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the funeral, John Maribel, having looked 
in vain for Perry, concluded that he had left 
the graveyard among the first, to avoid the unpleasant 
scrutiny of the curious, and thus dismissing the 
matter from his mind he turned his horse's head towards 
the Featherstone place. Choosing the back entrance, he 
entered the house, and in passing the kitchen heard a
strange voice mingling with Ursule's pleasant tones. The 
language being French, it was easy to guess that Babet 
was the visitor. Curiosity had taken Babet to see poor 
Abby buried, and a stronger motive had induced her to 
prolong her ride in order to visit Ursule. Always on the 
alert to turn to her own advantage whatever of discovery 
chanced to fall in her way, she had eagerly embraced this 
opportunity to find out something with regard to these 
strangers. Her eagerness was considerably stimulated by 
the knowledge of her mistress's strong opposition to her 
making acquaintance with Ursule. The conversation 
naturally turned upon Abby's sad fate, and as naturally 

<!-- page 295 -->

diverged to Worleigh and the family there. Babet fell 
upon De Rousy with all the acrimony of a woman who 
resents a man's insensibility to painstaking efforts at 
conquest.</p>

<p>"M. de Rousy knows how to play his cards, madame, 
and there are those whom he finds to believe in his honeyed 
lies; for example, this blonde whom he adores&mdash;the 
<i>m&eacute;chant animal!</i>"</p> 

<p>"And does the young lady love this <i>m&eacute;chant animal?</i>"
asked Ursule.</p>

<p>"<i>Ah, bah!</i> who knows what is in a woman's heart? and 
then she is but a child."</p>

<p>"Has <i>mademoiselle</i> no father&mdash;no mother?"</p>

<p>"We know the world, Madame Ursule; and that our 
betters have their secrets. They never guard them so
well but that we find them out. Eh?"</p>

<p>"Good servants are blind and deaf" answered Ursule. 
"Fidelity is rare; but it is sometimes found among 
them."</p>

<p>"Very fine, ah! very pretty, indeed! but one must look 
to one's interest. You understand <i>le chantage</i>, madame, 
that little commission which is legitimate gain on our 
employer's secrets. How else is one to put by for one's 
old age. My mistress has seen the world; she has lived 
a gay life; she is older than her husband; she is rich!
Is madame happy&mdash;is she rejoiced at M. Wilbraham's 
return? No, only once have I seen her content of late&mdash;only 

<!-- page 296 -->

once, when she thought that M. Pultney would die. 
His life interferes in some mysterious way with her safety, 
<i>Voila!</i>"</p>

<p>"My master's life!" exclaimed Ursule. "Do you 
mean that&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I mean that it is not well for them to live in the same 
neighborhood. Go away from this damp old place. Your 
master's life will be safer anywhere else."</p>

<p>While walking down the avenue, on her return home, 
Babet's reflections were of that one-sided nature which 
gave a strong personality to her conclusions. A thought 
of the opal brooch and the dresses aroused all of gratitude
of which her heart was capable, and formed an infinitesimal 
ingredient of the satisfaction which she felt at 
the result of her visit.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, John Maribel sat with Mr. Featherstone 
talking in the pleasant tone which savored almost of his 
former cheerfulness. Long years of practice had perfected 
him in what he called his "sick-room manners." He had 
a knack of finding out the tender places and touching 
them with the soothing ointment of sympathy&mdash;dealing 
out, at the same time, kind looks, pleasant smiles, and 
comforting words which, in many cases, were more efficacious 
than his pills and drugs. Under this treatment Mr. 
Featherstone was rapidly recovering his health, while his 
liking had expanded into a warm and appreciative esteem 
for the doctor.</p>

<!-- page 297 -->

<p>John supplied to him, in his own strong nature, the 
support which he needed. A timid and uncertain manner 
had always strongly derogated from his success in the 
world, and while he was clear-sighted for things afar, and 
was not untouched by the divine afflatus of genius, he 
was but the veriest child in all matters purely practical, 
and his calculations wandered so wide of common sense 
that this want had warped and hindered him in the lofty 
pursuits to which he had devoted himself. There was an 
incompleteness about him&mdash;a stopping short of that standard 
which he had in his own mind, but which he was 
never to reach. Coupled to a man like John Maribel, a
sober, practical adviser, whose solid qualities counterbalanced 
his more brilliant talents, he would have found the 
quickening impulse which he needed. As it was, throughout 
his whole life he had disappointed whenever he had 
been placed in competition. This falling short had acted 
adversely towards his moral vision, narrowing its scope 
and keeping it within the bounds of mediocrity when it 
should have reached the heights of success.</p>

<p>"Doctor," he said now, as he sat with his hands folded 
before him, his shoulders bent forward, and his eyes raised 
to John's face, "I believe that I have long needed a 
friend like you. For lack of a better I have depended 
much upon Ursule, and I must confess that she has provided 
a good deal of common sense, which has served me 
well on more than one occasion."</p>

<!-- page 298 -->

<p>"A man is lucky to have a friend in a woman," answered 
John. "She is usually cautious, and seldom gives unsound 
advice. A true woman communicates to a man a 
certain impetus towards emulation, which, if he has the 
right kind of stuff in him, will help him materially in his 
upward journey."</p>

<p>"His upward journey! Ah, Doctor! to me this has 
been a dreary, slippery way. I have never gone forward
without taking a retrograde movement. I have never 
dared to climb but I have fallen."</p>

<p>"Your unhappy domestic life has probably had much 
to do with this, Mr. Featherstone. Your mind and energies 
have been trammelled by the preponderance of an 
adverse influence which has strongly biased your usefulness. 
You tell me that you often contemplate the enjoyment 
which comes from the affections. Yours is, I think, 
a purely ideal conception of domestic happiness. Its 
practical realization bring to you a severe disappointment; 
for even in the nearest relations with 
human affection we seldom find the fulfilment of expectation. 
Either we ask too much or give too little, or, on 
the other hand, have lavishly squandered our all and get 
but barren return."</p>

<p>Mr. Featherstone's face bore an expression of newly 
aroused interest in this man whose bright nature had 
hitherto so completely contradicted the possibility of hidden 
cares and disappointments. "Excuse me, Doctor," 

<!-- page 299 -->

he said, "but your words convey to me a deeper meaning 
than perhaps you intend. Is it possible that you, too, 
have suffered a heart-wound?"</p>

<p>"Few men arrive at middle age without some such experience; 
but, my dear sir, we will wreck our ship if we
do not steer wide out of the shoals of sentiment. I have 
your promise, I believe, to accompany me to Col. Covington's 
the day after to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, "I have consented, because you 
have insisted, and because I firmly believe that you are 
not a man to speculate upon intangible fancies."</p>

<p>"Far be it from me to deceive you, Mr. Featherstone, 
into false expectations. You have been long and cruelly 
deprived of that felicity which you are eminently constituted 
to enjoy, and which I have just reason to hope is now 
within your reach. Take courage, my friend," continued 
John Maribel, rising and holding out his hand to him, "I
trust to God that the future has in store for you a large
indemnity for the past. Good-by, until to-morrow."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XLVI.</p>

<p class="small">"IN FAITH, 'TWAS STRANGE, 'TWAS PASSING STRANGE."</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Doctor</span>, one word with you," said Ursule, who 
had been lying in wait at the kitchen-door.</p>

<p>"With all my heart," he answered, following 
her into the room.</p>

<p>Ursule laid her hand upon his arm, and approaching 
her mouth to his ear, she whispered: "Babet has been
here."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Her words have alarmed me. My master must leave
this place to-morrow, Doctor&mdash;I would say this very 
night, were it possible."</p>

<p>"You must explain yourself," answered John Maribel. 
"What danger menaces your master?"</p>

<p>"A woman's secret."</p>

<p>"Ursule, that wily Babet has been putting some nonsense 
into your head. How can a woman's secret affect 
your master?"</p>

<p>"It may send a pistol-ball, a dagger, poison&mdash;what do 
I know, <i>mon Dieu?</i>"</p>

<p>John looked at her with a puzzled expression and a 

<!-- page 301 -->

keen scrutiny, which betrayed a suspicion, which I am 
quite ashamed to say was a most unworthy one. We
must remember that for many long years he had had 
dealings with any number of Sairey Gamps; and these 
decent women had somewhat perverted his faith in feminine 
abstinence. I only refer to this as a possible extenuation 
of an outrage which Ursule would most heartily 
have resented had she known it.</p>

<p>"Ursule," he said, "you use strong language. I really 
do no not understand what you mean."</p>

<p>"I mean," she answered, "that Mrs. Wilbraham is interested 
in getting my master out of the country, and 
that Babet has warned me of his danger."</p>

<p>John Maribel rose from his chair, the color receding 
from his face as he asked: "Do you know anything 
more, Ursule?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that you have put Miss Pitkin in the 
lion's den. What then&mdash;don't you see?"</p>

<p>He struck his hand to his forehead exclaiming: "Yes, 
I see my cursed folly! While I have thought myself unselfish, 
I have been the veriest egotist&mdash;nursing my pride
at the expense of her safety. My God! at whose door 
lies the guilt of Abby's death? It is dreadful to think 
that this man will go free to repeat his crime whenever 
innocence and beauty come within his baneful influence."</p>

"Doctor, pardon me!" said Ursule, "but I am most 
anxious for Mr. Featherstone. I must find out this 

<!-- page 302 -->

woman's secret. Remain with my master to-night; I 
must have time to think and to act. Ah! do not refuse 
my request," she added, seeing hesitation in John Maribel's 
face.</p>

<p>Compliance was rarely difficult to him, unless it involved, 
as on this occasion, the renunciation of that strict principle 
of honor which was the integer of a finely organized morality, 
shrinking with strong repugnance from any conceivable 
violation. Ursule, with no mean knowledge of 
human nature, divined at once that it would require a 
strong argument to overcome his opposition, and, like a 
skilful general, she attacked his weakest points.</p>

<p>"Doctor," she said, "have you remarked Mrs. Wilbraham's 
fondness for Miss Pitkin, her anxiety to have 
her always at Worleigh? Is this sudden <i>penchant</i> for so
young a person natural&mdash;do you not suspect a motive?"</p>

<p>"I must confess that I am not altogether pleased at 
the intimacy," he answered, in a somewhat repellant 
tone.</p>

<p>"Ah, Doctor, I understand that I am taking a liberty; 
but I implore you to trust to my prudence and discretion, 
I have an idea that when I shall have discovered 
madame's secret, that we will know also, why she wishes 
Miss Pitkin to marry M. de Rousy."</p>

<p>"Ursule," he answered very deliberately, "your attachment 
to your master may lead you into false conclusions 
which may materially affect a woman's credit."</p>

<!-- page 303 -->

<p>"I am fifty-two years old, Dr. Maribel," she answered, 
with a touch of dignity. "Thirty-two years of them I 
have served my betters in one capacity or another, and, I 
say it with all modesty, I believe that I have deserved 
their confidence and approbation. Trust to me. You will 
not repent of it."</p>

<p>So long as human nature is subject to human impulses, 
so long will a preponderant passion exercise its influence 
in balancing the pro and con of conflicting reasons. 
Ursule's words had aroused a feeling of keen apprehension 
on Kitty's account, which, joined to a deep sense of responsibility 
and an increasing consciousness of that love which 
had grown into strong and vigorous life in that intimate 
association of years, caused him to compromise with his 
scruples, and yield a consent to remain with Mr. Featherstone 
until the next day.</p>

<p>Ursule immediately set about her preparations for the 
morning. She sent a message to Patty Searing, asking 
her to come to her at daylight, and then she busied herself 
putting everything in order for her master's comfort, 
for she had little faith in Patty's capability as a cook. 
At nine o'clock she took her candle to go to bed. Her 
sleeping-room was on the opposite side of the hall, just 
at the foot of the staircase. As she placed her hand 
on the knob of the lock, it rested there, while she looked 
up the gloomy ascent of the dark old steps that led to the 
ghostly solitude above. In looking, an idea came to her, 

<!-- page 304 -->

and she proceeded to ascend the stairs. This time she did 
not go to Mrs. Featherstone's room, but turned into a side 
room, the decaying boards creaking most unpleasantly 
under her feet. The room which attracted her to this 
midnight inspection had been Oscar Featherstone's, and 
she had well-nigh robbed it of all of its furniture in fitting 
up the rooms down stairs. There remained, however, a
small bookcase with empty shelves, one or two chairs, and 
a table. The bookcase was the only promising object in 
the room; so to this Ursule went, determined to search 
through its drawers and compartments. She thought that 
it was more than likely that she would find some letter or 
scrap of paper relating to her master's courtship&mdash;something 
which would throw some light upon his unhappy 
marriage.</p>

After a thorough examination of every shelf, Ursule 
poked about nervously in the corners with her fingers, to 
find nothing but dust. The nether part, which was a sort 
of cupboard, was likewise entirely empty. A projection 
in front, sloping downward, suggested the possibility of a 
desk, and after several efforts, she succeeded in raising the 
heavy lid, which, folding downward, revealed compartments 
for ink, and, between these, a longer space for 
paper-cutter, pen-holders, etc. Suspecting that it might 
contain a secret cavity, she pressed her fingers upon the 
bottom of the compartment, again and again trying the 
corners, and then with patient manipulation the whole 

<!-- page 305 -->

surface. Four or five times had the experiment been repeated, 
a desperate perseverance had taken possession of 
her and urging her to renew the effort. She held the 
light straight over the cavity, but the commonplace old 
desk refused to yield up the mystery, because, in all 
probability, it had no mystery to reveal; so, with a
feeling of disappointment, Ursule took up her candle 
and returned down stairs.</p>

<p>Her night-cap proved to be a thinking cap; for no 
sooner were the muslin strings tied under her chin than 
she bethought her of the tin box which she had found 
Mrs. Featherstone's closet. What more probable than 
that a loving mother had possessed some token of her 
son's infatuation&mdash;that she had garnered some trifle which 
would serve now to help her, the faithful servant, in 
her effort to compass that son's safety.</p>

<p>Her very imperfect knowledge of English permitted 
her to do little more than read the signature of these 
letters, which she took out one by one, unfolding them 
and placing them on the table at which she was sitting. 
The mystic characters of the old Egyptian hierogrammatics 
could scarcely have been less incomprehensible to her; 
but at last, a sheet of thin paper fell to the floor. It had 
been refolded into a narrow strip and thrust in among the 
letters; but it was a prize&mdash;for there, in small, cramped 
characters, was the name of "Frances Agatha Wilbur."</p>

Oscar Featherstone had probably left this little missive 

<!-- page 306 -->

between the leaves of a book, or in his coat pocket, and, as 
mothers often do, Mrs. Featherstone had preserved it.
We must take for granted that its preservation argued a
tender appreciation of the writer's avowed affection for 
her son. No such thoughts, however, passed through 
Ursule's brain. She uttered an articulate "<i>Mon Dieu</i>," 
and then by a natural train of reasoning arrived at the 
conclusion that she held a clue to Mrs. Wilbraham's secret.
Agatha had neglected the safeguard of a complete change
of name. She had evidently not calculated upon those 
subtle agencies which spring into action and work out 
with tenacious and inflexible justice the doom of retribution. 
She had not thought it worth while to take 
measures against improbable danger, and in the lapse of 
twenty years had learned to feel perfect security from the 
chance of identification with the young governess who had 
borne the name of Frances Wilbur.</p>

<p>There are those who read life as they do a book, casting 
away the treasures of thought&mdash;unheeding the delicate 
beauty of design or the cherished images of truth. They 
read to amuse themselves, "run over the book" to get 
at the story. Agatha had given but little attention to 
the serious readings of that great unrolling scroll on which 
the history of her life was traced. She knew not how 
much of human joy and grief, of human love and hate, 
were involved in her past&mdash;that past which was being 
dragged to light in the home which she had desecrated. 

<!-- page 307 -->

A foreign woman, unlettered, and urged by no personal 
interest, was there, patiently adapting the scanty material 
at hand to the accomplishment of her ruin.</p>

<p>At six o'clock, this woman, dressed in a plain alpaca 
gown, her cap replaced by a bonnet, and looking a decent, 
middle-aged body, was giving her last directions to Patty 
Searing before setting out for Worleigh.</p>

<p>"You are to tell my master, my child, that I will return 
before dinner. Pray do not overdo the beefsteak, and 
above all, take care of the majolica cup. Do you heed, 
Patty? The cup out of which Mr. Pultney always takes 
his coffee."</p>

<p>She had reached the corner of the house when Patty's 
voice recalled her. Patty was leaning from the window. 
Ursule looked up to the fresh young face with its crown 
of soft, brown hair rippling away from her white forehead.
A softened light beamed from her eyes, which were circled 
with delicate violet rings&mdash;a sign of much weeping.
There was a subdued consciousness about her which 
expressed the presence of some newly experienced impression&mdash;a 
hesitancy which grew out of a danger of being 
misunderstood by the foreign woman.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Madame Ursule," she said, "for calling 
you back; but your road takes you by the graveyard.
Would you mind giving this to Reuben for her?" and she 
held out a great bunch of roses. "She used to like this 
kind, and maybe she'll know that I sent them."</p>

<!-- page 308 -->

<p>"I will do what you wish, <i>mon enfant;</i> I will place the 
flowers on the grave, and say a prayer for the good of 
her soul."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XLVII.</p>

<p class="small">"I FOUND THIS PAPER."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> preoccupied with her errand and
giving a thought now and then to her master's 
breakfast, Ursule still had an eye for the sweet 
young day, smiling coyly from behind the trees which 
fringed the distant hills. It was a good five miles to 
Worleigh, and the Searings' mule did not differ in its 
amiable characteristics from mules in general. He travelled 
under protest, unprovoked by Reuben's hard words and 
harder blows into any livelier manifestation of sensibility 
than to break into a trot, which was the merest mockery 
of his good intentions, as each relapse reduced his gait to 
a more tantalizing slowness. When, at last, he had 
brought them to the side entrance at Worleigh, Ursule 
alighted from the wagon, leaving Reuben to wait for her. 
A dozen eyes caught sight of the strange woman, and a 

<!-- page 309 -->

dozen ears pricked up with eager curiosity as she asked 
whether she might see Babet.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, ma'am; please just step in and sit down," replied 
a mulatto girl with oval face and large lustrous eyes.
"She's gone up with madame's coffee, and will be back 
directly."</p>

<p>Babet soon appeared with the empty coffee-cup in her 
hand. At sight of Ursule, her flat, yellow face grew expressive 
of eager curiosity.</p>

<p>"Ah! but I am glad to see you, Madame Ursule," she 
exclaimed. "How good of you to come so early, just 
when I have an hour to spare. Do me the kindness to 
come to my room. We may talk there at our ease."</p>

<p>Once in Babet's room, Ursule proceeded to make known 
her errand, and as human nature has undergone no radical 
change since Eriphyle received the famous necklace of 
Harmonia, a roll of bank-notes will in most cases quiet 
the obtrusive protests of conscience. It required no remarkable 
perspicuity to discover that the application of a 
general rule would bring out a certain result, and the 
offered bribe was accepted by Babet with little affectation 
of repugnance.</p>

<p>"My errand is urgent," said Ursule, "and my time is 
short. Let me entreat you to go at once to Mrs. Wilbraham 
with my request."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Wilbraham is quick of temper and capricious 
beyond anything," replied Babet, stuffing the bank-notes 

<!-- page 310 -->

into her purse. "I have some experience of ladies'
humors, but I am baffled at her fitful foibles."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Wilbraham's capricious vagaries can scarcely 
affect me," rejoined Ursule. "Show me the way to her 
room; and should you find yourself poorly paid, there are 
more bank-notes for the asking."</p>

<p>Babet's room was separated from Mrs. Wilbraham's 
apartments by a large closet containing wardrobes, and
this opened into a dressing-room into which she now conducted 
Ursule.</p>

<p>"Say to your mistress that I come from the Featherstone 
place."</p>

<p>Babet laughed as she whispered: "Do you take me for 
a child? You hold madame's secret!"</p>

<p>"I cannot blame you," answered Ursule, "for not comprehending 
that there may be service without hope of 
reward. Your head is filled with your abominable <i>chantage</i>. 
It is but another name for thievery, and merits 
its punishment. <i>Eh, bien!</i> how much longer am I to 
wait?"</p>

<p>"Madame has been generous; but secrets are ugly 
things, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your greed is not yet satisfied!" indignantly exclaimed 
Ursule.</p>

<p>"You bid me open Mrs. Wilbraham's door, do you? 
You are asking much&mdash;yes, very much."</p>

<p>"Ah!" gasped Ursule, drawing out her purse. "You 

<!-- page 311 -->

are laying up for your old age, <i>mademoiselle</i>&mdash;a worthy 
undertaking!" and while she spoke transferred to Babet's 
skinny hand another slice from the savings of years.</p>

<p>Agatha looked straight at Ursule as she entered the 
room. The need to dominate over the immediate pressure 
of danger which she saw in the presence of this 
woman, had given to her face an expression of energy 
which was not lost upon Ursule as she returned her 
glance.</p>

<p>"Your visit is untimely," she said, "scarcely excusable; 
unless&mdash;&mdash;"</p> 

<p>"Unless, madam, its object justifies its untimeliness. 
I come on an errand which admits of no delay."</p>

<p>Was Oscar Featherstone dying&mdash;was her deliverance at 
hand? Ursule, who had purposely left open the door of 
the dressing-room, went back and closed it, thus cutting 
off the possibility of being overheard by the pair of ears 
which she shrewdly guessed were well practised in eavesdropping.</p>

<p>"Madame," she said, standing before Agatha and 
speaking in a low, but decided voice, "you perhaps divine 
the motive which brings me here?"</p>

<p>"You give me credit," answered Agatha, "for a keener 
degree of perception than I can honestly lay claim to. 
Pray explain your errand, for I decidedly object to being 
kept in a state of suspense."</p>

<p>"Then madame will excuse me if my words give pain.

<!-- page 312 -->

I have come solely on my master's account. I am alarmed 
for his safety."</p>

<p>"Your master's safety!" exclaimed Agatha. "Why 
have you come to me? what have <i>I</i> to do with your master's 
safety?"</p>

<p>"Madame," answered Ursule, taking a step nearer to 
Agatha, "madame, my master's death would relieve you 
of a menacing danger; therefore have I come."</p>

<p>"Then he is not dead?" said Agatha, her face growing 
colorless.</p>

<p>"No, he is not dead, nor likely to die. Dr. Maribel 
has brought him through the fever; but medical skill 
does not insure against means which may be used to 
silence a troublesome witness."</p>

<p>"Your words are disagreeably suggestive of an insulting 
and horrible suspicion. You dare much when you 
come into my private apartments; and pray do not force 
me to insist upon your leaving the room and the house at 
once."</p>

<p>"I have no fear of your anger, madame. It is causeless 
and unwise. Our interview need not be prolonged. 
I have ventured much for my master's sake&mdash;I have no 
personal interest to serve; so much the greater reason 
that you should listen to me. Madame, your precautions 
have been badly taken. You are Frances Wilbur, who 
was governess at the Featherstones over twenty years 
ago."</p>

<!-- page 313 -->

<p>"This is a shallow conspiracy," cried Agatha, "an attempt 
to extort money. Say how much you will take to 
hold your tongue."</p>

<p>Despair and terror had driven her into a fatal imprudence&mdash;an 
admission which Ursule was not slow to understand. 
If she had had any doubts before, they had vanished 
now before Agatha's ill-concealed dismay.</p>

<p>"Madame," said Ursule, with a tinge of irritation in 
her tone, "my master has taken care that want shall give 
me no excuse for the greed of money-getting. I am independent 
of all those influences which so easily pervert a 
servant's honesty; but I am not insensible to your trouble;
neither is it my intention to betray you. Your immediate 
danger lies in discovery, which will affect your 
relations with your present husband to your utter disgrace
and ruin. Mr. Featherstone is a terrible witness against 
you. As long as he lives his saddened life must be a reproach 
to you, and a woman like you, madame&mdash;a woman 
who has her <i>all</i> at stake, is not to be trusted."</p>

<p>Agatha shivered as she walked to and fro, listening to 
Ursule's terrible words. The intensity of our wishes often 
makes us believe in the certainty of their fulfilment, and 
Agatha had relied greatly upon the chance of Featherstone's 
death as the surest way out of her difficulties; but 
although she could hope for deliverance through this 
channel, she was guiltless of the intention which Ursule's 
word implied. She saw herself judged by this woman, 

<!-- page 314 -->

and for the first time the possibility of crime as a sequence 
of her actions presented itself to her mind. Recoiling 
with horror, as from a terrible and newly revealed enemy, 
Agatha turned upon Ursule, with flashing eyes and nostrils 
distended by passion.</p>

<p>"Woman," she said, "you have lowered me in my 
own estimation by your judgment of me. One may 
become unconsciously reconciled to an idea. Tell your 
master to go away&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;" her face changed in its 
expression.</p>

<p>These quick transitions were natural to her, a new hope 
had sprung up in her heart&mdash;it was one of those straws at 
which despair mockingly points. "Can you prove that I, 
Mrs. Wilbraham, was the penniless governess who married 
Oscar Featherstone?"</p>

<p>Ursule drew from her pocket the letter which she had 
found, and held it towards her.</p>

<p>Agatha paused a moment before looking at it, and then 
her eye fell upon her own signature&mdash;"Frances Agatha 
Wilbur." Mechanically, she seated herself beside the 
table in the centre of the room, and, perhaps, overcome by 
the rush of fresh emotion, she remained silent, leaning her 
head upon her hand, the elbow resting on the table. Ursule 
was standing behind, her eyes fixed on the thick coils 
of blue-black hair. An observer might have noticed a 
quick bending forward, and an eager scrutiny in her 
bright black eyes. These experienced eyes had detected 

<!-- page 315 -->

a deception. The color of Agatha's hair was not natural. 
Madame had not yet made her toilet. The skillful 
hands of Babet had not been called into service, and the 
<i>mascaro</i> had not been applied to the hair about the neck 
and temples, the blond color of which was plainly perceptible. 
How Ursule pitied her&mdash;this woman with her 
dyed hair and guilty heart.</p>

<p>Agatha had taken a pen from the stand and was tracing 
her name upon a sheet of paper. She seemed to have forgotten 
Ursule's presence. Again and again she wrote her 
name, always comparing it with the handwriting of the 
letter, and always finding the same fatal resemblance between 
the two signatures. At last, as if frenzied by repeated 
failure, she rose to her feet, tearing the paper into 
shreds and scattering them on the floor.</p>

<p>"Madame," said Ursule, "I nursed my master many 
long years ago through a terrible illness. Time had not 
then dulled the poignancy of his grief, and in his delirium 
he spoke often of a woman who had hair like a 
Madonna."</p>

<p>Agatha gave a short, nervous laugh, "She was blonde, 
then, this woman whom he loved. The old masters glorified 
their madonnas with blond hair."</p>

<p>"Yes, with such hair as yours once was."</p>

<p>Agatha heard this assertion with positive terror. Ursule 
spoke with the assurance of one dealing with solid 
facts, and these are ugly opponents. The victory must 

<!-- page 316 -->

always be on the side of facts, provided they are hurled 
by a steady hand.</p>

<p>"Madame," exclaimed Ursule, seeing that she had no 
further opposition to expect from Agatha, "God be my 
witness that I intend you no harm. My object in 
coming to you was to secure your promise never in any 
way to interfere with Mr. Featherstone's safety or happiness. 
When I say happiness, I anticipate a future with 
which you may materially interfere. You understand, 
madame? You must protect Miss Pitkin from any possible 
harm which may menace her."</p>

<p>"I understand you," said Agatha, in a dull, despairing 
tone. "I know to what I pledge myself when I give you 
the required promise. Go, I entreat you. Your master 
is in no danger, at least such danger as you apprehend; 
but I cannot shield him from the consequences of his 
foolish and fatal love. I was unworthy of him then; I 
am far more guilty now."</p>

<p>"Madame," Ursule's voice betrayed the sympathy 
which she felt for Agatha, "no one need know that a poor 
servant has discovered your secret."</p>

<p>Judging from that moral standard which she had gained 
by intercourse with a world which had given her no very 
exalted opinion of its disinterestedness, Agatha was 
tempted to have recourse to what, in most cases, proves a 
conciliatory negotiator; but her ready tact warned her 
that any offer of money would be an affront to one whose 

<!-- page 317 -->

forbearance towards herself argued a nobleness of character 
entirely opposed to the pusillanimity which would accept 
a bribe to clinch a promise.</p>

<p>Agatha sat where Ursule had left her; the positive 
misery of her position bringing that apathy which settles 
upon a soul in view of the inevitable. Her secret was in 
the keeping of a woman, and that woman a servant. Was 
it worth while to continue the struggle? Her eyes turned 
quickly towards the dressing-case; it was so easy&mdash;a few 
drops more, and then! "Ah, my God! how my heart 
trembles and grows weak!"</p> 

<p>She rose from her seat, and walked to the open window. 
She heard Miss Eleanor speaking to the gardener.
They were just under the window. "See that these flowers 
are sent at once, Roderick, with my compliments, to 
Miss Pitkin."</p>

<p>Suddenly her trouble seemed to change its aspect. "My 
God!" she murmured, the hot tears streaming down her 
cheek. "Would that she were indeed Kitty Pitkin!" 
The thought of the threatened shame and exposure became 
intolerable. How she clung to Kitty's love&mdash;the only 
human love upon which she could have relied in all its 
pure integrity. Impelled now by the power of this love, 
which acted upon her impulsive temperament as a stimulus 
to a higher degree of generosity and self-sacrifice than 
that of which she was ordinarily capable, she determined 
to place Kitty under the protection of her father. Her 

<!-- page 318 -->

mind had reached that climax of suffering which had impaired 
its powers of reasoning, and in coming to this decision 
she had really overlooked the consequences to herself; 
but Agatha rarely counted cost, and perhaps the 
hardness towards herself, and her indifference to her own 
fate, grew out of an undefined sort of repentance which 
sought absolution in self-inflicted punishment. On the 
other hand, her flight from Worleigh was escape from 
a thraldom which was horribly irksome to her. A beggar 
is not apt to be ashamed of his rags; they are tokens to 
him of a freedom which, however revolting from our 
standpoint, has certain phases of enjoyment which he 
would not willingly yield up. So a woman who has once
broken free from the restraints of social obligation and 
tasted of the dangerous freedom of irresponsibility, is
hardly to be trusted when she forsakes this freedom for 
the (to her) galling servitude of respectability. We are 
apt to think in the abstract of such women, if we think 
about them at all; but there are few whose experience 
will not enable them to particularize, and who have not 
been called upon to exercise a plenteous charity in their 
judgment of them.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XLVIII.</p>

<p class="small">"THIS SPEECH OF YOURS HATH MOVED ME."</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">So</span> you have nothing to tell me, Ursule?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely nothing, Doctor."</p>

<p>John Maribel buttoned his riding gloves, while 
he gave Ursule a somewhat doubting and reproachful 
look.</p>

<p>"I must find your master all right to-morrow morning," 
he rejoined.</p>

<p>"Ah! but I am glad to get him away from this dull 
house. <i>Pardon</i>, Doctor, but to a man like Mr. Featherstone 
a disappointment is serious."</p>

<p>"You think, then," answered John Maribel, "that I 
have been indulging his fancy. Well, there may be little 
harm in allowing a man to think that the morrow has 
some good in store for him, especially if the probability is 
strong in his favor."</p>

<p>"But if the morrow comes without the good, what 
then?"</p>

<p>"Why, he will have had a good night's rest, and all
the better bear his disappointment. I think I may safely 

<!-- page 320 -->

predict a pleasant day at Oaklands for your master. Good 
night, Ursule."</p>

<p>John rode away at a brisk pace. He had a visit to 
make to a sick child before going to Oaklands, where he 
was to pass the night. He was proceeding slowly along the 
road which passed by Blackwell's orchard, when he espied 
Jope balancing himself on the topmost rail of the fence, 
and wearing an aspect of dejection and forlornness which 
suggested the possibility of some new trouble at Blackwell's.</p>

<p>At sight of the Doctor he sprang to the ground, exclaiming, 
"Oh, Doctor, if I could have had my wish just now, 
it would have been to see you a-coming along this road.
Aunt Susan is worse, sir. I was thinking about going 
after you to-morrow morning, but it's all the better that 
you've come to-night." He walked slowly beside the 
horse as he talked.</p>

<p>"Is Perry at home, Jope?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I haven't seen Perry since that awful and ever-to-be-remembered 
day."</p>

<p>John's face looked grave as he said:</p>

<p>"I waited to see him after the funeral, Jope; but not 
finding him, I concluded that he had come here."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," answered Jope, with a slight hesitancy of 
manner&mdash;boys are so naturally reserved on those subjects 
which reveal the undercurrent of their feeling, the softness 
of which they are half-ashamed&mdash;"I went to the graveyard 
this morning. It seemed so lonesome like for her to 

<!-- page 321 -->

be left there, and nobody to go nigh her. The grave was 
sodded as nice as could be, and I saw tracks all about it.
These tracks were made by Perry's boots, Doctor, I am
sure they was."</p>

<p>"Perry is shy and proud," said John Maribel, speaking 
as if to himself; "and he takes his grief all the harder 
because he will not let a friend share it with him."</p>

<p>"Doctor," remarked Jope, turning his head a little to 
one side and thrusting his hands in his pockets, "I always 
have found that innard sort of people is the deepest. 
Say-nothings is good-doers."</p>

<p>John Maribel was inwardly amused at the manner in 
which Jope delivered himself of his homely aphorism; but 
he admitted its truth with a countenance of perfect 
gravity.</p>

<p>"Jope, you surely have heard something of Perry?"</p>

<p>"Only what old Brutus told me, sir. He went over to 
Worleigh last night, and was late coming home. He told 
me this morning that he saw a man cross the creek and 
take the road that goes up to Collin's store. I'm pretty 
sure that it must have been Perry, Docter."</p>

<p>John Maribel rode on in silence, Jope's words were 
ominous. He know that Perry held tenaciously to his 
own way of judging men, and that the treachery of which 
he had been the victim was likely to create an unhappy 
influence upon his character.</p>

<p>They had reached the house, and Jope fastened the 

<!-- page 322 -->

Doctor's horse while he went in to see the sorrowing old 
people. The kitchen was deserted, and Jerusha, hearing 
his footsteps, came out of the opposite room and asked 
him to go in.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blackwell lay on a bed of painted pine, very high 
from the floor, and piled with mattresses and a feather 
bed, while several small, soft pillows supported her head. 
A checked homespun counterpane, bordered with deep 
fringe, covered her form, and the poor old hands were 
clasped in helpless grief outside. John was shocked to 
see the ravages which sorrow had traced on her face, and 
he spoke to her in tones soft with tender and pitying 
sympathy.</p>

<p>"It's no manner of use, Doctor," she murmured, "it's 
no manner of use to physic me; I don't know as I care to 
stay now she's gone, my only one, the baby of my old 
age!"</p>

<p>A groan proceeded from the bent form of Blackwell, 
who sat in the darkened corner. John had not been 
aware of his presence, and turned to speak to him; but at 
sight of the poor stricken old man he held his peace.</p>

<p>Blackwell wore no coat, and his suspenders hung loose 
from his pants&mdash;unwashed, unshaven, in dark, comfortless 
sorrow he sat, speaking no word, making no sound, save 
now and then the deep guttural groan that seemed rending 
his very soul.</p>

<p>"It's dreadful, Doctor," whispered Jerusha, "that 

<!-- page 323 -->

dreadful that I can't bear to look at him. He hain't said 
a word or eat a mouthful since yesterday; and I don't believe 
he lay down last night. Won't you speak to him, 
sir? maybe you could say something as 'll stir his heart 
and break up his grief like."</p>

<p>"I will do my best, Jerusha," and going over to where 
Blackwell sat, he laid his hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>"My good friend," he said, "your wife is ill. Rouse 
up; it is not like you to neglect her."</p>

<p>"Eh, Doctor! Susan's been poorly for years," he 
answered, without lifting his head.</p>

<p>"All the more does she need your care now. Come, my 
friend, I have a word to say to you. Not here; we will go 
out."</p>

<p>With gentle force he assisted the old man to rise, and 
they went out into the barn-yard amid familiar sights and 
sounds, and seated themselves upon an overturned trough.</p>

<p>Instinctively, Blackwell straightened himself and looked 
about him. The force of habit was breaking through the 
lethargy that seemed to have deadened him to every consciousness 
save that of his affliction.</p>

<p>The tramping of hoofs and the rustling of fodder that 
was being torn away from the rick fell upon his ear, and 
with kindling ire he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"The brown ox is at the fodder! Where's the lazy 
rascal that he can't put up the bars?"</p>

<p>Never had words fallen more pleasantly upon Jope's 

<!-- page 324 -->

ear. This, at least, was natural. His uncle's dreadful 
silence had awed him into positive terror, and even at his 
own expense he was glad to have it broken up.</p>

<p>"He jumped the bars, Uncle Mark; but he hasn't had 
time to do much damage. I'll have him out in a minute." 
And away he went chasing the mischievous beast into the 
pasture. This little scene was just what John Maribel 
would have arranged had he had anything to do with it. 
As it was, he felt very much obliged to the brown ox 
who had opened a way to further conversation about the 
yield of fodder, the sweet potato crop, the mare that 
had just foaled, and the pigs that had been brought home 
from the creek. From wood and pasture the lowing 
herd came homeward. The milking hour was at hand.
Blossom and Daisy, Cherry and Pretty-maid, one by 
one they stood outside the fence, turning their great 
soft eyes towards their eager calves. Abby had named 
the cows. Daisy and Blossom were perhaps associated in 
her mind with some ramble through the spring woods 
when the dogwood was in bloom, and Cherry and Pretty-maid 
were souvenirs of some maiden dream, the quaint 
fancy of a country-girl used to the simple weaving of 
untutored thoughts. Jerusha came out with the milk-pail, 
glancing uneasily at Blackwell. She guessed what 
was passing in his mind. "Turn in Blossom," she said 
to the boy who watched the calves. As the beautiful, 
white creature stepped over the bars, a great sob arose 

<!-- page 325 -->

above the clamor of the barn-yard. Blackwell bowed
his head on his shaking hands, and wept aloud. It was 
like the breaking up of a storm-cloud&mdash;the outletting of 
pent-up waters. Rising, he tottered towards the house 
and entered the room where his wife lay. Sinking on his 
knees beside the bed, his softened heart sent forth its 
appeal for mercy and pardon.</p>

<p>John Maribel heard the old woman's piteous weeping 
mingling with her husband's broken supplications. He 
knew that all was well with Mark Blackwell; and with a
kind word to Jope and a comforting assurance to Jerusha, 
he mounted his horse and rode away</p>

<div class="center" id="ch49">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XLIX.</p>

<p class="small">"I KNOW HIS GAIT, 'TIS HE."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Jerusha had placed the supper on the table, 
she went to the old man and coaxed him to 
come and partake of some refreshment.</p>

<p>"The coffee is strong, Uncle Mark, and I fried a bit of 
bacon for you. Aunt Susan might take heart to drink 
her tea if only you would eat and take comfort."</p>

<!-- page 326 -->

<p>"Yes, husband," insisted Mrs. Blackwell, "try to take 
comfort. It's not right to turn from God's  gifts."</p>

<p>To humor her desire, Blackwell went to his supper. 
Jerusha had opened wide the windows, and the slanting 
sun-rays lay across the sanded floor. Blackwell seated 
himself in his accustomed place; but he forgot to thank 
God for the smoking corn-cake and crisp bacon. Thankfulness 
is a vivid consciousness of obligation which allies 
itself to gratitude, and is spontaneous in acknowledgments; 
while grief, like joy, is an absorbing sentiment 
and precluded the recognition of that immediate need 
which Mercy divines and for which a loving Father finds 
remedy. Blackwell at that moment was alive to but
one emotion, the bitter consciousness of Abby's absence.
Everywhere her memory lingered&mdash;everywhere association 
linked it to the minutest details of every-day life.
His old heart was busy with the past. He felt his little 
one clinging about his neck and pressing her soft, round 
cheek to his; he saw her running to meet him as he came
from the fields, and then bringing him the gourd of fresh 
spring-water, holding her little hand beneath it, to catch 
the overflowing drops; he saw her expanding into maidenhood 
under his doting eyes, fresh and blushing as the 
roses which she loved to gather. And oh, God! he saw 
her with that beauty marred&mdash;all her comeliness destroyed 
in the cruel horror of her death. A sense of 
bitter desolation overwhelmed him as he murmured:

<!-- page 327 -->

"Turn Thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I 
am desolate and afflicted."</p>

<p>"Uncle Mark," exclaimed Jerusha, "I've heard you 
trying to comfort other people, and why can't you take 
the words that you said to them to yourself. God's 
promises haven't changed their meaning as I knows, and 
what He says He's likely to perform. Uncle Mark, you're 
forgetting that you are not the only one who loved <i>her</i>&mdash;you 
are forgetting that <i>he's</i> wandering round, God knows 
where; and you taking no account of what may befall 
him."</p>

<p>"God forgive me, Jerushy, God forgive my selfish 
grief."</p>

<p>The habit of fastening upon Jope a responsibility, which 
was not the least of those hardships that he was called 
upon to bear uncomplainingly, induced the old nan to turn 
sharply upon him, saying: "Eh, Jope, where is Perry 
gone to?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I wish I could tell you, Uncle Mark."</p>

<p>"You take the mare," continued Blackwell, "and go 
to Oaklands&mdash;he's working there&mdash;and you say that I 
want him to come home."</p>

<p>The young man, trained to prompt obedience, pushed 
aside his plate, and rose to leave the room, a look from 
Jerusha warning him to keep silent. As he saddled the 
mare, he reflected that Perry was not a man to go back on 
himself when he had made up his mind to a certain course 

<!-- page 328 -->

of action, and that in all likelihood, having failed in his 
purpose the night before, he would return to Worleigh.
Acting upon this conviction, he rode down to the creek, 
and leading the horse a short distance from the road, 
fastened the bridle to the limb of a willow. He then 
crossed the creek and stationed himself where he had 
view of the road and the lower portion of the grounds of 
Worleigh. After waiting what seemed to him an interminable 
time, he saw a tall, drooping figure approaching, 
and as it passed within a few feet of him he recognized 
Perry Deane. With an unutterable dread in his 
heart he cautiously followed him, walking as much as
possible in the shadow of the shrubbery, and keeping at a
safe distance.</p>

<p>As usual during the summer months, the library windows 
were open, and the interior of the apartment perfectly 
visible from without. It was De Rousy's habit, as 
we have seen, to sit here after the rest of the family 
had retired; and, as if cognizant of this fact, Perry approached 
the window, not with the stealthy step of the 
murderer, but boldly, like a man who had no fear of 
being recognized.</p>

<p>As the light gleaming from the window fell on his face, 
Jope saw the clear, hard eyes, the firm-set jaw, the long-neglected 
beard and unkempt hair, and in his face and 
attitude a firm resolve. Within, the handsome, cynical 
De Rousy sat with his swarthy cheek resting on his white, 

<!-- page 329 -->

delicate hand. The whole mien of the man expressed insolence 
and self-confidence.</p>

<p>The window being low, Perry stepped easily from the 
ground, and without hesitation walked straight to the 
table at which De Rousy sat, not, however, before he had 
perceived the presence of the intruder, and risen to his 
feet.</p>

<p>"What does this intrusion mean, fellow?" he exclaimed, 
in a menacing tone.</p>

<p>"It means," answered Perry, deliberately, "that you 
will listen to what I have to say."</p>

<p>"Ha! you have stolen into Mr. Wilbraham's house 
after the fashion of the melodramatic villain, to wreak 
your vengeance on me, ha, ha! Take my advice, my good 
fellow, and go home. I suppose you consider yourself
injured, though, upon my word, I don't know for what; 
and if you have come here with the idea of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried Perry; "take care of what you say. I
know as little about a fine-dressed villain as you do about 
an honest man; but I know right from wrong, and I know, 
by G&mdash;! what a man deserves when he takes away a girl's 
good name, and drives her to her own destruction. I
came here last night to deal with you according to my 
ideas of justice."</p>

<p>De Rousy was unarmed, and no match for the stalwart 
carpenter. His eye glanced rapidly over the room in 
search of some weapon with which to defend himself.</p>

<!-- page 330 -->

<p>"I don't mean to harm you," said Perry, contemptuously. 
"If I did, you are completely at my mercy. My 
arm would stand me in good stead against two such men 
as you are. I told you that I had a few words to say to 
you, Mr. de Rousy, and I intend to say them. I came here
last night, and there in that chair sat Kitty Pitkin. I saw 
something in her face which melted my heart into pity, 
and turned me from my purpose. Her love protects you 
as long as you do fairly by her; but I swear to G&mdash; it 
will go hard with you, if ever <i>again</i> you play false to her. 
Do you heed me, Mr. de Rousy? I'll have it out of you, 
and pay the double debt I will owe you."</p>

<p>"Your threats are easier made than executed, my good 
fellow," answered De Rousy, resuming his assurance;
"but, upon my word, I have no object in deceiving you 
or any one else in this matter; and I would pledge my 
soul for the truth of my words, when I say that had Abby 
not met with a horrible death there was no reason why 
she should not have been your wife. She was innocent."</p>

<p>"Mr. de Rousy," said Perry, "I wish I could believe 
you; but to my way of thinking you've just done the 
greatest injury which a man can do to a woman&mdash;you have 
taken away her good name, and all that you can say will 
never give it back to her. You know she lost her life in 
trying to get to you."</p>

<p>"Let me speak&mdash;let me speak," cried Jope, springing 
through the window; "thank God, I'm here! The night 

<!-- page 331 -->

before the storm I was sitting in the kitchen, when Abby, 
came in quite unexpected and sudden-like. Uncle Mark 
and Aunt Susan was gone to prayer-meeting. Abby came
in and spoke to me, and I answered her as I shouldn't 
have done if I had known what was in her heart. She
burst out crying and sobbing, saying as how she had lost 
her good name, all along of listening to him as sits there. 
She said she knew that she had done wrong, and she asked 
me, in a piteous way that would have moved your heart, 
Perry, to help her. I promised her to do the best I could; 
and I went to Oaklands to ask you to forgive her. I
started in the rain, Perry, to fetch you to her, and as I 
was riding back with disappointment in my heart&mdash;as I 
was there by the creek, I saw her. Oh, Lord! it was a 
sight to break a man's heart! As to you, sir," addressing 
himself to De Rousy, "if she was innocent&mdash;and I
believe she was only light and foolish-like&mdash;if she was 
innocent, there's no thanks due to you for it; and I'd as 
soon as not cut your lying throat, that I would, for all 
the trouble you've brought on them as never harmed you.
She can't speak for herself, poor, dead Abby; she can't 
say as how in her heart she was true to Perry; she can't 
tell how she threw your red ring into the farthest corner 
of the kitchen, which Jerusha she swept it out and buried 
it. No, she can't tell how her poor heart ached for shame 
and sorrow when Dr. Maribel saw her a-talking to 
you. Oh! she's dumb enough now; but I'll speak for 

<!-- page 332 -->

her and I'll clear her name; and by the Lord, sir, I'd like 
to strip off your fine feathers and show you up for what 
you are!"</p>

<p>Jope's earnestness left no doubt about the truth of his 
words or his courage, which would have led him then and 
there to match his strength with De Rousy's, had not 
Perry whispered a word in his ear.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered aloud, "it's all along of her that I 
give in, and more's the pity!"</p>

<p>He thrust his hands into his pockets, as if the temptation 
to use them was still strong upon him, and continued: 
"I'll say this for Miss Kitty, that I'll never believe as 
how she takes to the likes of you, unless I hear it from 
her own lips and sees it with my eyes."</p>

<p>"Which you are scarcely likely to do, sir," replied De
Rousy with overbearing insolence of manner. He knew 
that he was safe from physical violence&mdash;that these men, 
poor and humble as they were, had spared him from a 
sense of delicate consideration for the young creature 
whose happiness was involved in his fate. Secure in this 
knowledge, he continued: "Go back to your pigs and 
calves, boy, and forget that you ever knew such a person 
as Kitty Pitkin."</p>

<p>"When I do," answered Jope, "it will be a bad business 
for you."</p>

<p>"Mr. de Rousy," said Perry, with a dignity and firmness 
which commanded the respect of the man whom he 

<!-- page 333 -->

addressed, and enlisted his attention, "you have taken
advantage of my forbearance to be insulting in your words 
and manner. If I crushed every bone in your body there 
isn't a man in the county who would condemn me; and perhaps 
there's many a one as will say what I don't deserve, 
because they will never know <i>why</i> I have spared you. 
Now I intend that you shall clear Abby's name of the 
foul stain which rests upon it. It is not sufficient that 
you have declared her innocent to me. You shall do it 
before witnesses&mdash;gentlemen of standing, whom I will 
select; and I require this of you as much for Miss Pitkin's 
sake as for the memory of her who is beyond the 
reach of human aid. This is all I have to say. I give 
you until to-morrow night to fulfil those conditions&mdash;remember, 
until to-morrow night; and by G&mdash;, sir! you 
are let off easily; for I could take your life this moment 
with less remorse than I would kill a vicious dog."</p>

<p>De Rousy quailed before the flaming eyes of the stalwart 
carpenter. He gave the promise in good faith, 
feeling, however, an unpleasant apprehension as to the 
effect which his confession would make upon gentlemen 
who held rigid ideas in matters of this kind, and might 
think it their duty to expose his conduct to Kitty's 
friends.</p>

<p>"I don't care to come here again," said Perry, "Mr. 
Wilbraham's house is no place for me to come to settle 
this difficulty; and an ugly one it will be for you, Mr. 

<!-- page 334 -->

de Rousy, if you shirk your promise. Name another 
place of meeting, and I'll be there."</p>

<p>"I shall go over to Oaklands to-morrow," replied De
Rousy, "and, in all probability, it will suit you to have 
the damned business over before the men whom I expect 
to meet."</p>

<p>"Well, yes; if you say that you'll come out square 
before Col. Covington and Dr. Maribel, I'll be satisfied."</p>

<p>De Rousy marked his sense of relief, when the two men 
had rid him of their presence, by stretching out his legs to 
their full length, and after a prolonged yawn placing a 
daintily-rolled cigarette between his lips. He dismissed 
a speedily as possible from his mind the remembrance of 
the humiliation which he had suffered at the hands of his 
recent visitors; and with equal facility did he dissipate, 
in the wreaths of smoke which went curling upward from 
his well-shaped lips, all moral responsibility in their 
troubles.</p>

<p>It would require a deep and subtle knowledge of the 
shadowy phases of that secret inner life which in tortuous 
darkness works out the schemes of selfish villainy, to 
attempt to understand the intercommunication between 
this man's interest and his passion for Kitty. True, however, 
was it that his sensuous love could easily become 
subservient to his interest, and placed in the balance it
would weigh as nothing against the deep-seated ruling 
motive of his selfish heart. Being fully alive to the nature 

<!-- page 335 -->

of Kitty's feeling towards himself, he foresaw the consequences 
which Perry had intended in all probability to 
bring about. The impudent carpenter, who pretended to 
deny to a gentleman the right of amusing himself! "<i>Ah, 
bah!</i>" he exclaimed aloud, "<i>le jeu vaut la chandelle</i>, or
long ago I would have turned my back upon Worleigh, its 
mistress, and these independent rustics who dictate terms 
to a man, with an assurance which is positively absurd.
Ha! ha! Think of my being obliged to confess that&mdash;well, 
upon my word, it isn't pleasant to think about."</p>

<p>He hummed an air from "<i>Le Barbier</i>" as he passed 
Agatha's door on his way to his own room.

<p>CHAPTER L.</p>

<p class="small">"BITTER SHAME HATH SPOIL'D THE SWEET WORLD'S 
TASTE."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the first time since his illness, Oscar Featherstone 
sat at his organ; his fingers wandering 
softly, feebly over the keys; but gathering force 
from inspiration, the notes gradually grew in strength, 
until the old house was filled with the swelling melody. 
His fancy seemed revelling in strains which breathed the 

<!-- page 336 -->

joy of a grateful heart&mdash;some alluring anticipation quickened 
his genius into exquisite improvisation, and the 
remembrance of the evil past receded before the effulgence 
of that happy light which dawned upon his soul. The 
music softened into a low, plaintive air; it commingled 
with the dream which wrapt his senses into unconsciousness 
of all outward impressions, else he would have heard 
an opening door&mdash;he would have known that his fate, in 
the person of Agatha, stood close behind him. Every tune 
drawn from the instrument by those delicate hands pierced 
her guilty breast with poignant anguish. They told her 
of a pure soul lifting itself upward&mdash;catching glimpses of 
the glory beyond, where, with assured foreknowledge, he 
saw the sublime consolation of an enfranchised life. She 
stood looking at the man whom she had so basely deceived. 
As she listened to the enraptured strains, an impulsive 
sympathy moved her to a vague, undefined longing, which 
resolved itself into a yearning for forgiveness. Emotional 
remorse is pervading while it lasts; and Agatha noted 
with quickened sensibility the premature signs of age in 
Oscar Featherstone. She had little actual experience of 
this kind of self-reproach, which became a positive pain 
as she looked at his bent form. But it was not in her 
uncertain and capricious nature to submit without impatience 
to sensations likely to disturb her habitual custom 
of adopting a mode of reasoning calculated to justify the 
motives which impelled her actions, and she suddenly 

<!-- page 337 -->

changed her position, placing herself directly before Mr. 
Featherstone. With quick comprehension of a long-dreaded 
possibility, he knew her in spite of her disguise, 
and, rising, stood looking fixedly upon her. There was 
more of curiosity than of surprise in the survey, and an 
absence of emotion, which was wounding to Agatha's 
vanity, and brought with it that sense of loss which is 
galling to a woman who has exercised the power of her 
fascination, and is suddenly forced to recognize her dethronement.</p>

<p>"You have not forgotten me in all these years?" she 
said; "you have not forgiven?"</p>

<p>"To forget, one must never have loved," he answered. 
"Forgiveness is an attribute of mercy, and God does not 
withhold its exercise in the adjustment of human offences, 
but it does not readily spring into action under the consciousness 
of cruelty and undeserved affliction."</p>

<p>He spoke in an incisive tone, which for him was the 
strongest form of reproach, and which stung Agatha with 
a certain sense of injustice towards that heroic resolve 
of which she was conscious in coming to him.</p>

<p>"Oscar," she said, "I would not impose upon you 
the idea that repentance has driven me to you to ask 
your forgiveness. No, I have come to you like a coward 
who is too weak to bear the shame of exposure and disgrace; 
I have come when my plans are menacing with 
failure and threaten to overwhelm another life in my ruin.

<!-- page 338 -->

Oscar, I will not deny that self-confidence and a foolish
reliance upon good fortune has warped the judgment which 
experience and knowledge of the world ought to have 
given me. In my passionate life I have garnered no 
stock of patience, none of that consolation which religious 
faith furnishes, and which, I suppose, is the best insurance 
against despair. I have none of the props with which 
good women sustain themselves&mdash;none of the virtues 
which make domestic martyrs. I have only the consciousness 
of my love and of my misery&mdash;the dread of a future 
without hope&mdash;the certainty of loss. It is hard, I know, 
for you to invest faith in my purity of intention, or in that 
purpose of atonement which mingles with the deeper current 
of my feelings; nor can I expect you to understand the 
suffering of a soul which relinquishes its chance of happiness 
in the realization of a life-long anticipation, when 
every action of that life has strongly contradicted the 
possibility of the existence of that virtue which is essential 
to the carrying out of a good purpose. I do not 
wish to deceive you into the notion that my coming to 
you is the result of a premeditated desire to commit an act 
of justice towards yourself; although my action has assumed 
the form of self-sacrifice and renunciation, and 
might easily lead you to idealize, as is your wont, a process 
which destroys impartial judgment; and it is no part 
of my intention to lead you into error with regard to my 
course of action in the future. I will even confess to you 

<!-- page 339 -->

that the conception of whatever is worthy in my resolve 
came after the knowledge of threatened personal risk, but 
you may rely upon my good faith, and upon the strength 
of that love which inspires me now to place a barrier 
between Catherine and myself, which will effectually 
separate her from the chance of shame and mortification 
which knowledge of our relationship would bring to her.
She knows me as Mrs. Wilbraham, and you may protect 
her from the wretched consequences of my ill-doing. The 
only mercy which I ask of you, Oscar, is to spare me to her.
The thought of her scorn and contempt is like the scourge 
of the avenging furies lashing me into frenzy.</p>

<p>She had spoken with passionate vehemence, her words
overcoming, in Featherstone's mind, the natural incredulity 
which resisted belief in this woman's singleness of purpose, 
and she had marked the changes in his countenance and saw
now with bitter jealousy the ineffable expression of joy 
and content which came with the knowledge of his daughter's 
existence. His joy was intensified by the assurance 
that her life had been spent apart from Agatha, that its 
pure current had been untroubled by the influence of 
a corrupt association, and his satisfaction found vent, as 
was natural to his devotional turn of mind, in an ejaculation 
of intense thankfulness to God, which irritated Agatha 
into one of those outbursts off passion under which 
Featherstone had so often mutely suffered.</p>

<p>"Keep back your joy," she cried, "until I am gone. 

<!-- page 340 -->

Do not mock me with a display of your exalted devotion 
which I could never endure!"</p>

<p>She had taken the old tone with him. She had never 
been able to comprehend his immeasurable superiority,
nor to respect those noble qualities whose manifestation 
were perhaps unpleasant reminders of her own moral want.
Oscar Featherstone yielded an involuntary obedience to 
high moral law, and in his heart this woman stood condemned; 
but there exists a beautiful harmony between 
justice and mercy. The one tempers the other, and out of 
the two is created the attribute, which, more than any 
other, brings the soul of man into tender relationship with 
Christ's humanity&mdash;forgiveness. With chivalric generosity 
he accorded her the ready sympathy of his generous 
heart, for in proportion to his own great joy was the 
natural grief which she suffered in presence of that inevitable 
separation from the child whom she loved. The
precious balsam of an approving conscience lends itself to 
a gracious action, and Mr. Featherstone made a step 
towards Agatha, his great, beautiful eyes softened with an 
emotion which caused hers to fall beneath them, her proud 
heart swelling at the thought of his pity; but she listened 
hungrily for his words. There was in his manner a reserve 
strongly repellant to the tone of familiarity which
she had assumed, and which was wounding to her keen
sensibility of implied reproof.</p>

<p>"Madam," he said, "believe, I pray you, that I accept 

<!-- page 341 -->

in its truest, highest sense the renunciation which 
you have made. I know what it has cost you, and while
I cannot but admit that you are doing what is far best 
for the dear being concerned, I most deeply deplore your 
unfortunate lot. If forgiveness for the wrongs which I 
have suffered at your hands can in any way alleviate your 
sorrow, believe me, it is freely accorded."</p>

<p>She gave him a swift, upward glance, in which there 
was awakened sense of appreciation. Perhaps just at 
that moment the overwhelming weight of desolation created 
a need for reliance on human sympathy; and her perfect 
confidence in Oscar Featherstone's sincerity gave her 
courage to ask a favor.</p>

<p>"I am not insensible," she answered, "to your generosity, 
nor will I deny that your forgiveness is indifferent 
to me. I have involved the innocent in the 
meshes of my own ill-doing, and I owe it to them to 
make what slight reparation I may. There is one over 
whose life I have exercised a fatal influence&mdash;a woman, 
old and afflicted, who, though she may have deviated from 
the path of strict honesty in her dealing with Dr. Maribel, 
yet merits his pardon; for in stooping to deception 
she yielded to a sense of higher duty, exercising a 
heroic self-sacrifice in carrying out a scheme which gave 
to Catherine a guide and companion whose refinement and
cultivation counterbalanced the disadvantages which unhappily 
surrounded her. You will hear from Dr. Maribel 

<!-- page 342 -->

the strange story of her abandonment. I have 
neither courage nor inclination to go through its recital; 
but I beseech you, for the sake of what she has done for 
the child, to protect Mrs. Parrott from the opprobrium 
which justly attaches itself to deceit. The fault is altogether 
mine, for I made use of that influence which all 
my life I have exercised over those who gave me their 
love, to force her to compliance."</p>

<p>"You may rest assured," replied Featherstone, "that 
she will suffer from no want of sympathy or lack of protection 
in her trying position. I can safely answer for 
Maribel's kindness; for a truly noble nature is lenient 
in judgment, and long years of association have taught 
him the worth of his companion. She shall be spared 
as far as it may be in my power. Pray give yourself no 
further uneasiness on this score."</p>

<p>"Then our interview need not be lengthened. It is 
but fair that I should leave no doubt upon your mind for 
the future." A great sob rose in her throat, choking her 
utterance; but with prompt self-command she recovered 
her composure and continued, "I promise you never to 
trouble you more. Good-by."</p>

<p>With a quick, sudden movement; she caught his hand 
and pressed it to her lips.</p>

<p>"Good-by; only now do I realize all that I have 
lost."</p>

Before he could detain her&mdash;before he had time to 

<!-- page 343 -->

frame a word, she was gone. He was still standing 
where she left him, when he heard the clang of the old 
iron gate, shutting her out forever from the home which
might have sheltered her.</p>

<p>CHAPTER LI.</p>

<p class="small">"FOR BY HIS FACE STRAIGHT SHALL YOU KNOW HIS HEART."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we have witnessed the throes of passion 
and the painful unrest of an anguished mind, 
we turn with a sensation of positive pleasure 
and relief to the contemplation of the calm delights of 
tranquil domestic life. Gracious reader, accompany me 
to the old-fashioned parlor at Oaklands, and we will there 
find repose and refreshment in the society of Colonel and 
Mrs. Covington, whose presence harmonize so perfectly 
with their rococo surroundings. Heavy polished mahogany 
chairs and tables; bookcases with glass doors lined 
with green silk, and filled with rows of respectable volumes, 
bearing names dear to the heart of every English 
scholar; a side-board with huge silver Pitchers, cut-glass 
tumblers and decanters; on the walls family portraits 
smiling complacently down at you, holding red volumes 

<!-- page 344 -->

with a finger thrust between the pages, as if they had 
been surprised at their reading and were still waiting to 
continue where they left off. One old lady, however, may 
be mentioned as an exception to this posthumous fondness 
for reading, and as a specimen likewise of an old 
lady who would be quite as unfashionable to-day as the 
books in the bookcase. She wore a white muslin cap, 
tied under a double chin, a spotless kerchief crossing 
her full bosom, and her small, delicate hands were folded 
on her black silk gown. We look up with instinctive 
respect, to find the clear, steady eyes meeting ours; and 
to judge, from the firm mouth with the somewhat square
chin, that the old lady held opinions which in all likelihood 
had been rendered effective by being put into pure, 
forcible English, and enunciated without fear of contradiction 
from her family. Indeed, "Sister Polly," as Col. 
Covington called her&mdash;her name was Mary&mdash;had been a 
matron, lovingly submissive to her lord, yet wielding with 
wise firmness the sceptre of her little kingdom. Pure in 
thought, simple in her habits, old-fashioned in her ideas 
about modesty and propriety&mdash;oh, dear! what would 
she think of young ladyhood of to-day?&mdash;earnestly pious, 
and shedding a wholesome influence, not only over her 
own immediate family, but also upon that larger family, 
those dependent beings of another race, whom she considered 
peculiarly committed to her care, and whose comfort 
and welfare were very near her heart. Such was 

<!-- page 345 -->

"Sister Polly," a type of a race which has well-nigh 
passed away. We have lingered a moment, looking at 
this "southern matron," and thinking, perhaps somewhat 
sadly, of the old life of which so little is left to us&mdash;and 
there are Colonel and Mrs. Covington shamefully neglected, 
while I fear</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"I am much too venturous<br/>

In tempting of your patience."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Here in their country home, away from the eager, restless 
life in "troublous cities pent," the uneventful days 
followed each other, bringing in rapid succession the 
changing seasons with their duties and employments.</p>

<p>Col. Covington superintended his fields and his orchards 
with the true taste of the country gentleman who had 
invested not only his money, but also his destiny in this 
pastoral life. He needed no turbulent excitement to 
chase away haunting remembrance; for although his days 
were not without care&mdash;Arcadia is a long way from the 
Southern States&mdash;and he was often involved in vexatious 
litigation, yet this very involvement was attributable to 
noble reliance upon human probity and&mdash;a simple faith 
in his lawyer's advice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Covington was apt to say&mdash;wives do make themselves 
<i>so</i> disagreeable when they attempt to think for 
their lords&mdash;that her advice listened to in due time and 
season would have been eminently effective in preventing 

<!-- page 346 -->

the disastrous consequences of her husband's too great 
leniency in business transactions. "The best of all 
wisdom," the old lady would persist in saying, "is to 
avoid the contrivances of the law;" but Col. Covington 
gave just that attention to her sound advice which men 
are apt to lend to feminine counsel, and in this instance, 
as in numberless others&mdash;the unpleasant occurrence in 
the garden of Eden notwithstanding, we will assert that 
such advice is both prudent and practical.</p>

<p>The old gentleman was standing near the door and held 
the buggy whip in his hand, for he was about to set out 
for Worleigh to bring Kitty home. His costume was 
what might have been seen anywhere in the days of our 
fathers and grandfathers: trowsers out with the "full 
fall," over which hung the watch fob-chain and seals, a 
black satin vest, and a plain broadcloth coat, with a 
black silk cravat, and, when occasion required its use, a 
red foulard handkerchief was inevitably to be found in 
the coat pocket.</p>

<p>They had been talking of the disasters of the storm, 
and speculating upon the manner of Abby's death.</p>

<p>"It is a pity, wife, that a man so agreeable in person 
and manner as is De Rousy should be wanting in the 
essential qualities of a truly honorable man."</p>

<p>"Wanting in the <i>essential</i> qualities, Col. Covington? I 
should think so!" exclaimed the old lady, looking at her 
husband over her spectacles. "I would like to give 

<!-- page 347 -->

Mr. de Rousy a piece of my mind. As for Abby, she was 
always a poor, foolish, vain thing, but pretty as a new-blown 
rose; and no one is to blame about her going astray 
half so much as Mark and Susan Blackwell. If Mark 
had quoted Solomon less and practised his wisdom more, 
he wouldn't now in his old age be ashamed to hold up his 
head among his neighbors. De Rousy is a sugar-coated 
villain. I don't hesitate to use plain words."</p>

<p>"You generally get at the core of things," the Colonel 
answered, smiling slightly, "and I perfectly agree with 
you, my dear, in thinking that this sugar-coating makes 
him a most unsafe companion for a very young girl.
However, I scarcely think that we will be much longer 
troubled with his presence in our neighborhood; and if he 
is wise, he will hurry his departure. Hugh will be here in 
a few days, to say nothing of another man who owes him 
a grudge."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Mrs. Covington, rising and putting 
her knitting in the work-basket, "I have little patience
with such men as Hugh Wilbraham. It is difficult to 
conceive of Charles Wilbraham's son making a fool of 
himself. In my opinion it's all come from his being sent 
to a German university, where his head was crammed with 
philosophy and metaphysics and Heaven knows what; as 
if Yale wasn't good enough, when you and his father and 
my own brother John were educated there, as your 
diploma will show. Why couldn't he have married Emma 

<!-- page 348 -->

Moreland or Clara Sayre, or half dozen others, instead 
of going to Europe and marrying a woman ever so much 
older than himself, and as unfitted to live <i>here</i> as a woman 
well can be. Think of a French maid at Worleigh, and a 
<i>gentleman</i> with <i>de</i> stuck to his name! That means, I 
suppose, indemnity for villainy."</p>

<p>The old lady ceased, with exasperation added to her 
already excited temper, as she perceived that when she 
had turned, while still speaking, to take a key from the 
mantel-shelf, the Colonel had made his escape.</p>

<p>That evening, John Maribel, Mr. Smiley, Mr. McStebbins, 
and Kitty, sat around the tea-table at Oaklands when 
Mrs. Covington, having recovered her equanimity, dispensed 
the fragrant tea in delicate china cups, while the 
Colonel carved the broiled chickens. Conversation turned 
upon politics, which the old gentleman discussed with a 
warmth that left little doubt as to his strong and deep-rooted 
conservatism, while Kitty sat beside John Maribel, 
pale and silent and scarcely touching the food on her 
plate.</p>

<p>John watched her with tender solicitude, and tried to 
bring back to his manner all its old familiarity and cheerfulness. 
In this, however, he failed. There was so much 
that was <i>defendu</i> between them! How could he speak 
unreservedly when his heart was full of thought for the 
morrow? All unconscious of what it was bringing for 
her, Kitty sat listening to the conversation. Not once 

<!-- page 349 -->

during that evening did her clear laugh ripple over to the 
old Colonel's ears as he sat in his arm-chair; and she 
refused to sing, pleading headache as an excuse.</p>

<p>"You are not well, Kitty," said John, holding out his 
hand to her as she was going upstairs. Her heart ached 
to tell him of her trouble, but oh! how could she? and 
at the same time she felt quite guilty of concealment 
towards him.</p>

<p>"Good-night, dear John," she murmured, with downcast 
eyes. "If he would only, kiss me," she thought, "as 
in the old times, and call me darling&mdash;it would be but for 
this once," and then she remembered that <i>other</i> kiss, and a
crimson blush covered face and neck. With sudden, 
unconscious violence she withdrew her hand.</p>

<p>"Kitty!"</p>

<p>The pain in his voice went straight to her heart.</p>

<p>"Oh! dear John, forgive me. I am sure I did not mean 
to pain you."</p>

<p>"Darling," he whispered, the great love in his heart 
speaking through his tender eyes.</p>

<p>"Take me back home, John," she pleaded; "you don't 
know how weak and sinful I have been&mdash;pray, let me go 
home." She had clasped his hand in both of hers, the 
quivering lips wore held up as in the days of yore&mdash;those 
rose-bud lips with their dainty curve.</p>

<p>She waited thus for his answer, while he remained 
dumb, looking at her. The struggle lasted but a moment.

<!-- page 350 -->

Once more honor triumphed over passion, and pride 
whispered that he was to her but the representative of 
that natural protector which she would find in her father&mdash;that 
her affection was but the habitual intimacy of 
years rather than the deeper feeling which springs into life 
with awakened love. John pressed the little hand to his 
lips, and said: "Sleep well to-night, darling. We will 
talk of going back to-morrow."</p>

<p>CHAPTER LII.</p>

<p class="small">"WE'LL HEAR THE WILL; READ IT, MARK ANTONY."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Day</span> breaks, "and yon gray lines that fret the 
clouds are messengers" of its advent. In blushing 
gladness the promise comes, and marshalled 
glory ushers the gorgeous majesty of day. Earth wakens 
to welcome him smiling in freshness, beautiful in color 
and sparkling with myriad jewels; while incense of 
mingled perfumes rises to consecrate her joy, and from 
her matchless choir bursts forth a grand <i>Te Deum</i> to celebrate 
the marvellous transformation. Oh! blind and 
deaf and dumb must be that being whose heart is dull to 
Nature's promptings; who does not see, in the "heavens 

<!-- page 351 -->

and the earth and all the host of them," cause for renewed 
thanksgiving; who is not ready, to cry in rapturous 
accents, <i>Adoramus te! Glorificamus te!</i></p>

<p>Oscar Featherstone watched the sweetening of the 
September light as it fell on grass and leaf and flower. It 
was Kitty's birthday. All living things seemed to partake 
of the great joy which filled his heart. Birds 
twitted in the hedges, bees hummed in the woodbine; 
the full-juiced apples hung mellowing in the sun; the 
pumpkins were turning gold among the corn, and the 
creamy fleece of the cotton was silvered with dew; while 
down in the valley the crystal waters stumbled over the 
dam and set the great mill-wheel turning. He found 
himself on his way to Oaklands, he scarce knew how, and 
sat silent beside John Maribel, replying briefly to his 
words.</p>

<p>Colonel Covington was waiting to receive them. "I am 
heartily glad to see you, Mr. Pultney," he said, shaking 
him warmly by the hand. It had been agreed between the 
Colonel and John Maribel that the <i>incognito</i> would be 
preserved until the moment arrived when Mr. Featherstone 
should see fit to declare himself. Mrs. Covington 
met them in the hall, and at once took the visitor in 
charge, declaring that after so long a ride, and in his 
weak condition, he must need immediate refreshment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Smiley conversed with Mr. McStebbins 
in the parlor, both of them anxiously awaiting the hour 

<!-- page 352 -->

fixed upon for the reading of the will. Kitty, in ignorance 
of the momentous event, gave little attention to the 
unusual bustle about the house. She was, however, 
startled into surprise, as she watched from her bed-room 
window the arrival of a stranger, and saw John Maribel 
helping him from the carriage.</p>

<p>"Ain't you going down stairs, Miss Kitty?" said the 
maid, coming in with a pitcher of water. "There's company, 
and mistress she's told Aunt Sabra to kill the big 
gobbler, and they are going to have whipped cream for dessert; 
and la! there's Mr. de Rousy a coming up the avenue; 
just look at him, Miss Kitty, a riding as if he'd 
never done a harmful thing, when, Lord knows, he'd 
better be thinking of her as is lying in the grave, all along 
of his wickedness, so folks say. What's the matter, Miss 
Kitty? Oh, I'll run and call mistress. You'll be a fainting 
right here, that white you've turned."</p>

<p>While she spoke Mrs. Covington entered the room.
The old lady wore her best cap and black silk gown; and 
the calm dignity of her manner was replaced by a flurried 
excitement which was little calculated to restore Kitty's 
equanimity.</p>

<p>"Are you sick, my child?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least, dear Mrs. Covington," answered 
Kitty, her pale face belying her words.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid, then, my dear, that you are nervous. It 
will never do. Roseanna, go down stairs, and look in the 

<!-- page 353 -->

right-hand corner of the medicine-chest, and bring me 
the red lavender. A few drops will compose you, dear 
child. You must change your dress, and come with me
down stairs."</p>

<p>"Will you not excuse me from going down until dinner?" 
asked Kitty.</p>

<p>"Most gladly, dear, did I consult my own inclination,
which is always to indulge your wishes; but your presence
is really necessary, and Mr. Smiley is now waiting for 
you."</p>

<p>Without further objection, Kitty proceeded to divest 
herself of her morning dress, obediently swallowed the 
lavender, and with Roseanna's assistance completed a 
toilet which Mrs. Covington pronounced perfect, as she 
took a rose from a vase and nestled it among the lace at 
her throat.</p>

<p>John Maribel was awaiting them at the foot of the 
stairs. "I was off this morning, Kitty, before you 
were up," he said, assuming a careless air; and drawing 
her hand within his arm, they proceeded to the 
parlor.</p>

<p>On entering, they were startled to see Mr. Smiley, with 
flushed countenance and indignant manner, speaking to 
De Rousy, who turned and bowed to Kitty. John felt 
her hand tremble as he led her to her seat.</p>

<p>"Mr. de Rousy," said Mr. Smiley, "do you not see 
that your presence has excited the young lady? Will 

<!-- page 354 -->

you force me to tell you that it is an unjustifiable 
intrusion?"</p>

<p>De Rousy leaned forward, and whispered in the lawyer's 
ear. The sting of an adder could not have startled Mr. 
Smiley more disagreeably than did De Rousy's words; 
while Colonel Covington, growing impatient of delay, took 
a turn on the piazza, and, as he re-entered the room, exclaimed, 
"Had we not better proceed to business, Smiley? 
De Rousy's presence, however unexpected, I am in duty 
bound to acknowledge with courtesy, feeling assured that 
it admits of explanation."</p>

<p>De Rousy came forward, his handsome lips curling with 
provocative insolence, and bowing slightly to Colonel 
Covington, he said: "Under ordinary circumstances I
would owe you an apology for my intrusion; but the circumstances 
under which I entered this room are entirely 
exceptional. I pray Mr. Smiley to proceed at once
with the reading of the will. As he said these words he 
coolly walked to the mantelpiece, and taking an attitude 
of <i>nonchalant</i> grace, prepared to listen.</p>

<p>Kitty seemed neither to hear nor to understand what 
was going on around her. She sat with downcast eyes, 
pale as the white rose at her throat. John Maribel stood 
behind her chair. Mr. McStebbins sat at the table looking 
nervous and uneasy; while Colonel and Mrs. Covington 
occupied arm-chairs, the old lady fluttering her cologne-scented 
handkerchief from time to time, while the Colonel, 

<!-- page 355 -->

with grave dignity disposed himself with head slightly
bent forward, elbows resting on the arms of his chair, and 
his fingers built into a pyramid, to give his attention 
to the important document with which the reader is 
already acquainted.</p>

<p>The long formula was gone through with&mdash;the names of 
witnesses, the date, etc., etc.&mdash;and in the midst of the 
complete silence which followed, Mr. Smiley rose from 
his seat, and bowing, said: "Miss Featherstone, permit 
me to be the first to congratulate you."</p>

<p>"A moment, sir," exclaimed De Rousy, stepping to the 
table, and leaning his white hand on it. The lawyer knew 
how seriously the words this man was about to utter would 
bear against the welfare of the young creature who sat so
still there, giving no sign of the violent emotion which 
rendered her mute, save in quivering lip and heaving bosom. 
"We have all heard," continued De Rousy, "the 
very clear and binding conditions of this will. Mr. Smiley, 
have the goodness to read over again the clause relating 
to the disposal of the estate in case of forfeiture."</p>

<p>Mr. Smiley read the clause.</p>

<p>"Now," asked De Rousy, "will you give your opinion 
as to its rendering?"</p>

<p>"The clause admits of no misapprehension," answered 
Mr. Smiley. "I am afraid that should Gaston de Ferri&egrave;re 
present himself with proper documentary evidence&mdash;in 
fact, his identity once clearly proven&mdash;it would be my 

<!-- page 356 -->

painful duty to acknowledge him the heir of one of the 
finest properties in the State. In that case, no one would 
condole more sincerely with Miss Featherstone than her 
obedient servant," bowing to Kitty.</p>

"Miss Featherstone's interest may be easily and naturally 
reconciled with those of the heir-at-law, for I assert 
that as that heir I claim her promise to be my wife." 
He locked around, his eye resting triumphantly on John 
Maribel as he continued: "I am prepared at every point 
to make good my claim to the Featherstone estate, 
and to prove that Frances Featherstone, in the person 
of Agatha Wilbraham, has broken the conditions of the 
will, and forfeited her child's rights; and that I am 
the Gaston de Ferri&egrave;re who is the fortunate possessor 
of wealth which he is ready to lay at Miss Featherstone's 
feet."</p>

<p>Kitty had risen from her chair and taken a step towards 
De Rousy, who stood revealed to her in all the blackness 
of his diabolical treachery. She felt that his sins were 
amenable to no human law; and as to the higher tribunal, 
which takes cognizance of moral crimes, he would dare to 
set aside its condemnation, scoffing at belief in its inexorable 
judgment or its power to inflict punishment. With 
burning shame she acknowledged that her fatal imprudence 
justified his audacious avowal of their engagement; 
but her indignation at his treachery towards Agatha overcame, 
for the moment, the consciousness of mortification 

<!-- page 357 -->

which this avowal was calculated to arouse in the presence 
of those friends whose respect she valued.</p>

<p>"Mr. de Rousy," she said, in clear, low tones, "I wonder 
that you dare stand in the presence of gentlemen and 
acknowledge that you have forfeited every claim to their
respect. If I understand you aright, the loss of my 
wealth is as nothing compared to the greater misfortune 
which your words imply. Mrs. Wilbraham&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is your mother, Miss Featherstone."</p>

<p>Kitty gave one piteous look around, and, holding out 
her arms to John Maribel, she cried, "John, dear John!"</p>

<p>In a moment the faithful friend was by her side. He 
supported her to the window, placed her in a chair, while 
Mrs. Covington, with anxious solicitude, chafed her cold 
hands, and attempted to comfort her in a gentle, motherly 
way.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Col. Covington turned upon De 
Rousy. "A man, sir," he said, "is bound to respect
moral obligations. Yours, it strikes me, are stringently 
binding to Mrs. Wilbraham; to her, exposure means 
both shame and ruin. Think of her, as she is to-day&mdash;the 
envied wife of a proud and high-born gentleman, 
secure in all those advantages of fortune which marriage
has brought to her; think of her as she will be when 
she knows that you have treacherously denounced her. 
See her bowed with disgrace&mdash;her dearly bought respectability 
gone&mdash;her very name a scorn and a by-word.

<!-- page 358 -->

Think of her in her shamed maternity, shorn in the first 
moment of acknowledgment of her right, even to her 
child's respect; and think, sir, of that noble gentleman who 
has placed all his faith and reliance in this woman&mdash;who 
has with chivalrous lovableness put aside the conventional 
judgments of his mind, and taken her upon her own showing&mdash;think 
of this man with the promise of fair honors 
in the career of which he has chosen&mdash;with the adjuncts 
of birth and education and wealth, all crushed out in 
overwhelming shame. Mr. de Rousy," he exclaimed, taking 
a step towards him in the excitement of his passion, 
"among all the wrongs which your fellow-beings have 
suffered at your hands&mdash;and I wish I could think they 
are few&mdash;this will be the foulest."</p>

<p>"Your words are eloquent, Col. Covington, and in my 
heart I believe you to be sincere&mdash;unpleasantly so, sir, 
for your climax reaches a personality. I have a slight objection 
to this. I confess that my moral vision is bounded 
by a strong bias towards self-protection&mdash;a not unusual 
trait of human nature&mdash;and that my knowledge of it 
rejects all divining conjecture of what may be beyond its 
natural instincts. In this instance, my natural instinct 
is to assume to myself the privilege of acting after the 
prompting of my&mdash;if you will&mdash;perverted judgment; and 
that points out to me the tangible advantage of fortune 
and the damned nonsense of what is called chivalric generosity. 
Can you suppose, sir, that I am going to give 

<!-- page 359 -->

up a fortune which it has been the object of my life to 
obtain?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," the old gentlemen answered in thundering 
tones, "I suppose no such a thing. You are a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment, Colonel," interposed Mr. Smiley, "Permit 
me to say a few words before concluding this very 
disagreeable business." Mr. Smiley had been intently 
examining papers which De Rousy had handed to him. 
"I entreat a further forbearance, my dear sir," he added, 
placing his hand upon the old gentleman's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Forbearance," he shouted, taking out his red foulard 
handkerchief with a flourish, "forbearance&mdash;yes, until he 
is well out of my house."</p>

<p>"By George! Smiley," cried Mr. McStebbins, "are you 
coming in now with your buts and <i>probabilities?</i>"</p> 

<p>"I am endeavoring, gentlemen," he replied with dignity, 
"to perform a duty towards my clients; for as yet you have 
taken much for granted, and it is my desire to show you 
that overwhelming testimony turns everything in Mr. de 
Rousy's favor. I only wish, sir," he added, turning to Mr. 
McStebbins, "that I could rebut this testimony. Ethan 
Featherstone in his testamentary provisions in behalf of 
his son's child, with full knowledge of the mother's character, 
imposed&mdash;as you remember&mdash;the most rigid and inexorable 
conditions upon their execution. These had
especial reference to Frances Agatha Featherstone, whom, 
I am sorry to say, I identify with Mrs. Wilbraham."</p>

<!-- page 360 -->

<p>"Gracious Heaven!" exclaimed Mrs. Covington; 
"didn't I tell you, Colonel, how it would all turn out!"</p>

<p>"Upon her conduct," continued Mr. Smiley, "and her 
actions, hinges the inheritance of the child which Dr. 
Maribel found alone and forlornly miserable in the grim 
companionship of the dead old man. Any infraction, 
then, of the conditions which Ethan Featherstone imposed 
upon his daughter-in-law on that terrible night when she, 
a mother, was called upon to forswear her own child, and 
that by an oath the most fearful and agonizing to a
mother's heart, would necessarily annul the universal 
bequest of his estate to the child, leaving her with only a 
trifling annuity, and conveying the whole of his possessions 
to his nephew, Gaston, only surviving child of his 
sister, Agnes Featherstone, by her lawful husband, Charles 
Alphonse de Ferri&egrave;re. Mr. de Rousy, or I should say Mr. 
de Ferri&egrave;re, has evidently thoroughly prepared himself for 
the consummation of his plans. To establish his identity, 
he has with silent but untiring industry procured all the 
necessary authentic evidence of the lawful marriage of 
Agnes Featherstone to Mr. de Ferri&egrave;re, and of the issue 
from that wedlock of a son, whose identity in his own 
person he fully establishes by registry of birth, baptismal 
certificate, <i>affidavits</i> of nurses, attendants, tutors, and 
other collateral evidence required by the legal exigencies 
of the case. On account of an unpleasant difficulty at 
Wiesbaden, the particulars of which were freely discussed 

<!-- page 361 -->

in the clubs of London and Paris, it became necessary for 
Mr. Gaston de Ferri&egrave;re to abandon his former haunts and 
to assume a name and disguise which would shield him 
from the vengeance of the Herzog family. This accounts 
for my having so completely lost sight of him that I 
imagined him dead, and for my being totally unprepared 
for a denouement which leaves me the most unpleasant task 
which it has ever been my duty to perform&mdash;that of declaring 
Mr. Gaston de Ferri&egrave;re the lawful heir of Ethan 
Featherstone. I make this declaration from a conviction 
that with such evidence as he possesses it would be useless 
to oppose his claims; although I am at your service, 
Miss Featherstone," he said, turning to Kitty, who made 
no sign of having heard his words. Then he drew his 
thin lips tightly over his teeth, and whispered to De Ferri&egrave;re, 
as we shall henceforth call him: "By Jove, sir! I 
wouldn't like to stand in your shoes to-day!"</p>

<p>De Ferri&egrave;re arched his brows until they almost reached 
the roots of his hair, while a movement of the shoulders 
clearly expressed the very slight importance which he attached 
to the lawyer's outburst of temper. While human 
nature lasts, there will always be much that is low and 
bad in its component parts; and it would have required 
metaphysical subtlety to have discovered any latent virtue
in the complicated intricacies of this man's character.
Mr. Smiley, however, with no mean knowledge of the 
world, actually entertained in his own mind the possibility 

<!-- page 362 -->

of reaching some unvitiated sentiment in the heart of De
Ferri&egrave;re&mdash;some finer trait of humanity beneath the polished 
insolence of his tone and manner. His own earnest 
feeling in the matter drew him into error, for in his long 
intercourse with mankind he had learned that human virtue 
and excellence are absorbed and lost in the voracious 
sea of self-interest, as are the streams and rivers that flow 
to the ocean. He was prevented from receiving one of 
those rebuffs which a man is apt to meet when he judges 
through medium of personal feeling, rather than from 
that knowledge which analyzes the complex motives of 
human actions, by the entrance of Col. Covington accompanied 
by Mr. Featherstone.</p>

<p>"Permit me," said the Colonel, "to present to you Mr. 
Oscar Featherstone, so long an absentee that his oldest 
acquaintances had well-nigh forgotten his existence."</p>

<p>A thunder-bolt falling in the midst of the company could 
have caused no greater shock than was experienced by 
those assembled there at this sudden and unexpected 
phase. Mr. Featherstone alone seemed calm and self-possessed; 
a fitful glow in his cheek, and the fond glance of 
his eye towards Kitty, were the only indications which he 
manifested of the exceeding great joy of this moment to 
which he had so long looked forward.</p>

<p>John Maribel stepped forth and shook Mr. Featherstone 
heartily by the hand, saying, with a slight tremor in 
his voice: "For eighteen years Kitty has been the sole 

<!-- page 363 -->

interest of my life. I yield her to you, sir, and rejoice 
for her sake that one so truly good and noble is henceforth 
to be her protector." Poor fellow, he said this and 
walked out of the room; while Mrs. Covington with 
gentle force assisted Kitty to rise from her seat, and led 
her bewildered and half-reluctant towards her father, who 
stood with outstretched arms waiting to fold her to his 
heart.</p>

<p>"God be thanked!" cried the old lady. "He has 
saved the innocent lamb from the wolf."</p>

<p>And then a silence fell upon them, broken only by Mrs. 
Covington's sobs, and an occasional sniff from Mr. McStebbins, 
as he wiped his eyes with his perfumed handkerchief. 
Col. Covington stood at the window looking 
very hard at something&mdash;perhaps it was at the peacock, 
which chose that moment to spread its feathers, and so 
he did not perceive Mr. de Ferri&egrave;re scathing the company 
with eyes which flashed, as if in mortal challenge, as he 
left the room.</p>

<p>We also will close the door, if you please, upon this 
scene.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Sad doth it seem; but nought is really sad,<br/>

Or only sad, that we may better be;<br/>

We should in very gulfs of grief be glad,<br/>

The great intents of God could we but see."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Ah</span> me!" sighed Miss Eleanor, closing Coleridge, 
"writers are apt to attribute personal unities to 
imaginary aggregates; and I wish that I, a 
small unit in God's vast human family, could feel in my 
own especial case that my trials are to work out for me 
or mine some special good."</p>

<p>The pale, worn face, with lines about the mouth so 
strongly drawn, and eyes so full of anxious trouble, was 
lacking in rounded contour and freshness of coloring; but 
it possessed the beauty which comes with the martyrdom 
of self-abnegation and unselfish renunciation, which shone 
round about it like the glory which the old masters loved 
to paint around the heads of their saints. Since the time 
that beside their father's coffin Eleanor had knelt with 
Hugh's curly head pressed close to her bosom, and his 

<!-- page 365 -->

wild sobs breaking her heart, she had put away the dreams 
of maidenhood and consecrated her life to him. The 
<i>summum bonum</i> of her earthly happiness consisted in the 
fulfilment of certain ambitious hopes secretly entertained 
for his honor and aggrandizement. She had the firmness 
and strength of will to endure, and patience to wait. 
Through long years she had with a firm hand held the 
reins that governed the little kingdom of which she had 
been sole mistress, and her calm and watchful judgment, 
added to her admirable self-control, had saved Wilbraham's 
estate from the pillage of agents and overseers. Rarely 
speaking of what she did, with beautiful modesty she 
often permitted others to assume the merit which was 
justly her own.</p>

<p>The garden violet, hid away beneath thick clustering 
leaves, permeates the air with delicious fragrance. As unobtrusive 
as is this lovely flower&mdash;so often cited to represent 
the sweetness of humility&mdash;as fragrant as its breath, 
were the virtues which crowned Eleanor Wilbraham. How 
is it, dear reader, that a quiet, encouraging, helpful spirit, 
giving out instinctively, and exacting little in return, 
seldom finds appreciation until it is too late for it to know 
the kind words and pleasant thoughts that come with the 
flowers which deck the coffin? Little does it matter 
then.</p>

<p>The tear which falls upon the inanimate face, the summing 
up of her virtues, the recital of her gentle deeds of 

<!-- page 366 -->

love and unobtrusive charities&mdash;all come like mockery to 
the dead woman whom no one took pains to please or
encourage while she lived. Some of us have known such 
a woman, apparently the least important member of the 
family; yet in reality the busy fairy who darned and 
mended and dusted, putting things in their right places, 
and pouring the blessed oil of thoughtful care into the 
grooves of household machinery, making it all to run so 
smoothly that no one seemed to suspect her agency or to
give a thought to the matter, any more than we think of 
thanking God for the sunshine. It is a very beautiful 
thing to give to the dead the sweetness of kind memories, 
and to weave a garland of virtues which we reverently 
place upon the grave. This is <i>post-mortem</i> kindness. We 
satisfy ourselves; but the still heart which lies beneath 
the sod knows nothing of it. If we had taken the same
pains while she lived, we might have lightened her burden 
and gladdened her faithful heart. Miss Eleanor Wilbraham, 
I dare say, has elicited little interest from the 
reader&mdash;a plain, middle-aged woman, neither brilliant nor 
accomplished, whose presence we would scarcely have 
noticed in the drawing-room, and whose exit from my 
story might have taken place without exciting serious 
regret or violating the rules of constructive art; and yet I 
will have performed my task but poorly should I fail to 
enlist a kind thought for her, or to gather a tear to your 
eye at recollection of some such woman, remembered now 

<!-- page 367 -->

with just that tender regret which your own shortcomings 
towards her arouses in your conscious heart.</p>

<p>Miss Eleanor sat in her chamber, listening to every 
sound which betokened her brother's coming; for Agatha 
had left home the evening before on pretence of going to 
meet her husband. We have seen whither she went.
Once or twice the anxious woman had gone to the window 
to look with wistful eyes in the direction whence she 
expected the carriage to come. Her waiting-woman, 
Hester, had been in and out of the room, making various 
pretexts for remaining near her mistress. For years Miss 
Eleanor had been subject to heart-disease&mdash;<i>hypertrophy</i> of 
the heart, Dr. Maribel called it. Hester had her own 
reasons for being anxious about her mistress. The
carriage had returned before Miss Eleanor was awake. 
There was a letter for her, which the coachman refused 
to deliver to Hester, saying that his orders from Mrs. 
Wilbraham were to give it into Miss Eleanor's own 
hands.</p> 

<p>"You may keep it, then," exclaimed Hester; "no 
letter, nor nothing else, is a going into that room this 
day. I'se had <i>my</i> orders from Dr. Maribel, and knows 
what I'm about."</p>

<p>Babet, sorely ill at ease, had also been watching Mrs. 
Wilbraham's return, and while thus engaged she saw some 
one riding furiously up the avenue whom she had not expected 
to see, and dismounting from his horse with a black 

<!-- page 368 -->

scowl on his face. Her quick suspicions were instantly 
aroused, and she ran out into the hall in time to meet De 
Ferri&egrave;re going to his room.</p>

<p>"Where is your mistress?" he growled.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu, monsieur!</i> do you not know that Madame 
went away last evening to meet her husband?"</p>

<p>"Her husband! the devil! I returned late from town
last night, and supposed your mistress to be asleep in her 
bed."</p>

<p>"<i>Monsieur</i> did not perhaps expect Mr. Wilbraham so 
soon?"</p>

<p>The mischievous twinkling in her eyes and the cunning 
smile which accompanied her words irritated De Ferri&egrave;re 
almost beyond the bounds of self-control.</p>

<p>"Go, and find out when those people are expected to 
arrive," he said, opening the door of his bed-room, and 
slamming it to again with angry force.</p>

<p>Babet found Sabra in the kitchen, busy preparing a 
feast to celebrate her master's return; but her temper 
seemed to have partaken of the pungency of the spices 
which she was pounding in a marble mortar, for she 
gave out her orders to her assistants in sharp, quick tones, 
and looked as grim as Cerberus when Babet asked when 
Mrs. Wilbraham was expected.</p>

<p>"The carriage has come back. You might have known 
that without bothering me with questions. <i>I've</i> got no 
time to be asking of them. There's one thing sure: 

<!-- page 369 -->

Mas Hugh ain't a-coming home to find that Sabra has 
forgot how to do Virginny cooking!"</p>

<p>"Uncle Steven is out to the stable, Miss Babet," volunteered 
one of the girls. "Maybe he can tell you why he's 
come back with the carriage."</p>

<p>"And Madame, where is she?" shrieked Babet.</p>

<p>Not waiting for a reply, she flew to the stable-yard, 
where Steven was busy cleaning the mud from the 
harness. In answer to her question, he said that he had 
"fotched" a letter, but positively declined to give it into 
her hands.</p>

<p>We all know how Samson was shorn of his strength by 
Delilah, how Hercules was stripped of his manhood by 
Omphale, and how Mr. Thackeray has shown that a brave
general may be converted into a weak tool by an ugly, 
yellow old woman. These examples prepare us for poor 
Steven's want of faithfulness when he placed Mrs. Wilbraham's 
letter in the hands of the French woman. 
Having possessed herself of the letter, Babet proceeded at 
once to deliver it to Misa Eleanor.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hester had been sent to inquire about a 
sick servant. Thus it happened that the poor lady was 
alone when Babet knocked at her door. She was sitting 
with closed eyes and clasped hands, listening for the step 
which never in this world was she to hear again.</p>

<p>Babet came forward holding out the letter, while Miss 
Eleanor started, half rose, then sank back again, looking 

<!-- page 370 -->

so pale and agitated that Babet retained the letter for a 
moment, saying:</p>

<p>"It is nothing, <i>Mees</i> Eleanor; only a note from Mrs. 
Wilbraham."</p>

<p>"Give it to me," she said, in a voice so feeble that the 
words were scarcely audible. "Leave me while I read 
it."</p>

<p>"Madame has perhaps sent some message&mdash;she left so 
suddenly," urged the <i>femme de chambre</i>.</p>

<p>"Go," exclaimed Miss Eleanor, this time in a louder 
and firmer tone.</p>

<p>With baffled curiosity, Babet turned and left the room.</p>

<p>The letter was closely written, and she leaned forward 
that the light might fall on the writing. No one will 
ever know whether she had mastered its contents; for 
when Hester opened the door, she lay prostrate on the 
floor, the letter still grasped in her hand.</p>

<p>Her meeting with her brother was postponed into 
eternity.</p>

<p>CHAPTER LIV.</p>

<p class="small">"SO I'LL DIE FOR THEE, OH, IMOGEN!"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the consternation and confusion consequent 
upon so awful an event, no one had 
thought of the fatal letter, which a servant had 
taken from the floor and laid on a table. Babet, anxious 
to possess herself of it, ventured into the room with the 
<i>air de circonstance</i> suitable to one very much shocked and 
grieved, and while she proffered service, which was coldly 
rejected, she managed to transfer the letter from the table 
to her pocket without exciting observation. Being 
unable to read English, she sought De Ferri&egrave;re, whom she 
found in the confusion of preparation for immediate 
departure. After he had addressed and sealed the note 
which he had been engaged in writing when she entered 
the room, he looked up, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Ah! what have you there, Babet?"</p>

<p>"Something that may be of service to you and to me, 
<i>monsieur</i>," she answered, giving him the letter.</p>

<p>"Ha! another imprudence of madame!" and he read, 
with curling lip, the passionate confession of Agatha, in 
which he detected the restless imprudence of desperation.

<!-- page 372 -->

De Ferri&egrave;re was quick to see the advantage which the 
possession of this letter would give him in dealing with 
Wilbraham. He was well aware that delicate sensibility 
to disgrace, and a natural shrinking from having his 
unfortunate family affairs made public, would strongly 
incline him to accept means which offered immunity from 
them. He quietly secured the letter in his pocket-book, 
while Babet stood looking at him with rage and disappointment 
tearing at her heart. She was prompt at 
seizing a truth applicable to a train of reasoning based 
upon a somewhat discolored view of human nature, and 
she comprehended with bitter self-condemnation that 
folly and stupidity had lost her the advantage which his 
ready perception of gain had led him so unscrupulously to 
appropriate.</p>

<p>"Babet," he said, "do you know that you have committed 
a serious offence in purloining this letter. I consider 
it my duty to place it in the hands of Mr. Wilbraham."</p>

<p>"<i>Mais, monsieur!</i>" she gasped, growing very pale.</p>

<p>De Ferri&egrave;re vouchsafed no further notice of her, but 
turned his back and spoke to the servant who was packing 
his clothes at the farther end of the room.</p>

<p>"Leave those things," he said, "and go at once to Oaklands 
with this letter. Deliver it to Mr. Featherstone, 
and say that you wait an answer. Bring it to me without 
delay, and a silver half-dollar will be your reward."</p>

<!-- page 373 -->

<p>Cupidity is inventive, and Babet set about at once to 
find some other means for turning Mrs. Wilbraham's flight 
to profit. An examination of her wardrobe and jewel-case 
suggested itself to her mind, and for this purpose she 
proceeded to the deserted room to find everything securely 
locked and the keys nowhere to be found. In her search, 
she discovered on the toilet-table an envelope addressed 
to herself, inclosing a sum of money sufficient to defray 
her expenses back to France, and a liberal amount besides.</p>

<p>"<i>Imb&eacute;cile!</i>" she exclaimed, striking her forehead.</p>

<p><i>Imb&eacute;cile!</i> And then the picture of a neat little shop with 
the name of Mademoiselle Babet Coulon, <i>couturi&egrave;re en robes</i>, 
placed over the door in gilt letters, impressed itself on her 
mental vision, and caused another desperate search for the 
missing keys. She expended a good deal of energy in 
thought and action, which, proving abortive, was the more 
exhaustive and irritating. The strain upon her nerves 
naturally resulted in an outburst of hysterical weeping, 
and with a sense of overwhelming injustice and injury 
she sank on a satin-covered chair and gave her thoughts to 
the serious consideration of her future. Her reflections 
resulted in a determination to appeal to Wilbraham.
Every human being has some peculiar propeller to the 
motive of his actions, and the bias of corrupt natures is 
clearly revealed in the course which they choose, to compass 
their ends. Misfortune at once offers temptation to 
inhumanity, and cruelty exults in its power to wound the 

<!-- page 374 -->

downfallen. Pocketing Mrs. Wilbraham's generous gift, 
Babet proceeded to the kitchen, where she found Sabra 
sobbing in a corner, all thought for Mas Hugh's coming 
home obliterated in her grief for the loss of her beloved 
mistress. Groups of dusky figures gathered about the 
doors, and men and women spoke in hushed whispers of 
the sudden sorrow which had fallen upon the family. All 
work was suspended everywhere&mdash;cries and lamentations 
went forth from the faithful hearts of those who knew 
that in Eleanor Wilbraham they had lost a tender friend.</p>

<p>Babet, astonished and frightened by this manifestation 
of affectionate grief, and knowing that she was looked 
upon with disfavor by the house-servants, was about to
retrace her steps, when Steven, from whom she had obtained 
the letter, espied her.</p>

<p>"Here's your half-dollar," he cried, taking it from his 
pocket. "It's the devil's money, and has brought us bad 
luck. If it wasn't for you, Miss Eleanor wouldn't be lying 
dead upstairs."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's her and her likes as has brought all this 
trouble on us," said a mulatto, with face all blistered with 
weeping.</p>

<p>Shaking his cyclopean fist at the terrified <i>femme-de-chambre</i>, 
he bade her begone. "Don't you tempt me," he 
cried, "to tear out your lying and deceitful tongue."</p>

<p>Babet, frightened beyond all self-control fled to De
Ferri&egrave;re, entreating his protection.</p>

<!-- page 375 -->

<p>"Go to your room," he said, "and lock yourself in. You 
have incurred the displeasure of these people. I cannot 
answer for the consequences."</p>

<p>When she was gone, he sat watching the clock on the 
mantel, until suspended expectation grow intolerable, and 
he determined to go out and meet the messenger whom he 
had sent to Oaklands.</p>

<p>At the door of his own room he paused, the action giving 
utterance to some thought which caused his face to assume 
a more pallid hue. His dressing-case was still unpacked, 
and from it he took a small silver-mounted revolver, 
which he secured in the breast pocket of his coat. It 
was a precautionary measure, suggested by his knowledge
of the very equivocal position which he held in the 
opinion of most people, and the decided dislike with which
he was regarded by those who know the circumstances of 
Abby Blackwell's death.</p>

<p>The house was now filled with friends and neighbors who 
had hastened to do the last kind offices to Eleanor Wilbraham, 
and De Ferri&egrave;re, shunning observation, stole out 
by a side entrance, taking a secluded path which led to 
the summer-house, and thence to a road principally used 
by wagons conveying wood to the house. A fierce impatience 
seized him as he strode forward, and he broke 
away with angry force the overhanging branches which 
impeded his free course.</p>

<p>The air turned chill as he walked along the unfrequented 

<!-- page 376 -->

road, and shadows grew dark in the dusk of the 
gloaming. What were his thoughts&mdash;what memories were 
lashing him into remorse? Everywhere&mdash;through the 
shadowy wood&mdash;down in the depths of the tangled copse,
and where the crystal ripples curled over their pebbly bed, 
softly murmuring among the sedges and water-lilies&mdash;everywhere, 
in low, wailing monotone, a voice reached his
ear, searching into the very depths of his being.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"That hour a horror fell on him,<br/>

A crawling terror shook each limb,"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>and it was with a sense of intense relief that he came out 
on the broad highway. Who will assume to gainsay the 
assertion that there exists some mysterious agency which 
forewarns; and although in most cases its warning is 
available to no definite purpose of protection, yet the mind 
is readily cognizant of its existence, and can look back with 
certainty to times and events when such warning has been 
the forerunner of misfortune.</p>

<p>De Ferri&egrave;re stood still in the middle of the road. He 
saw Perry Deane rapidly approaching from the opposite 
direction. There was menace and danger in the firm-set 
jaw and flashing eye as he stopped before him.  "False, 
black-hearted villain!" he cried. "You thought to escape 
me. I went to Oaklands, and you were not there; but 
I have heard enough to make me glad to crush you now, 
as I would a poisonous snake."</p>

<!-- page 377 -->

The stout cudgel which he carried was raised above De 
Ferri&egrave;re's head, and would have fallen with unerring fury 
had he not averted the blow by springing backward out 
of its reach. Quick as thought the revolver was drawn 
from his breast; there was a flash, a report, and the dull 
thud of a falling body striking the earth. De Ferri&egrave;re's 
heart gave a great bound of savage joy&mdash;the cruel exultation 
of satisfied hate, only to recoil in strong revulsion as 
he saw his enemy unharmed, stooping over a prostrate 
figure stretched across the road.</p>

<p>At the same moment the messenger from Oaklands 
reached the spot, De Ferri&egrave;re caught savagely at the 
bridle of the horse, bidding the terrified negro dismount. 
He snatched the letter from his hand, and vaulting into 
the saddle, fled as though he knew that the dire Erinyes 
were howling on his guilty tracks. Meanwhile Perry, 
unmindful of De Ferri&egrave;re's flight, was, with anguished 
heart, endeavoring to stanch the blood flowing from Jope's 
side. The unfortunate young man had received the ball 
intended for him.</p>

<p>"Go for help; run for your life, Tom," he cried. "My 
God! he will bleed to death!"</p>

<p>Poor, faithful Jope! He had gone with Perry to Oaklands, 
and Kitty, hearing that he had expressed a wish to 
offer her his humble congratulations, sent for him and 
presented him to her father as her good and faithful friend. 
Mr. Featherstone with delicate courtesy acknowledged 

<!-- page 378 -->

his pleasure at seeing him, and begged that he would afford 
him an opportunity of assisting him in some way pleasing to 
himself; and Kitty spoke so sweetly to him that as he looked 
at her, radiant in her new-found happiness, the old feeling 
came back to him of having her perform the Juggernaut 
feat. This metaphorical crushing was but the expression 
in his own mind of a great and humble love. She had 
given him her little hand at parting, so soft and dimpled 
that he scarce dared to touch it with his; and when she 
took a gold chain from her own neck and placed it around 
his&mdash;oh! he thought that no one before had ever been so
honored, and he found no words to thank her, only his 
tearful eyes looked into hers and spoke for him.</p>

<p>When Perry heard that De Ferri&egrave;re had left Oaklands, 
he followed him in hot anger, determined to punish him 
for his lack of good faith. On finding that his friend had 
departed, Jope set out at once in search of him, and was 
hastening to interpose between the two men whom he saw 
approaching one another when the fatal shot was fired 
which entered his breast. He was lying now in Perry's 
arms, his life-blood spurting from the wound, and his face 
so still and white that Perry bent his face close to his lips 
to satisfy himself that he was still breathing.</p>

<p>Yes, he was breathing, for the lips moved and he 
whispered:</p>

<p>"It's all up with me, Perry."</p>

<p>"Don't say that, Jope. Keep up your courage, 

<!-- page 379 -->

dear boy, until the Doctor comes. He'll be here directly."</p>

<p>Perry's voice was choked, and a hot tear fell on the 
boy's face.</p>

<p>"O Perry!" he murmured, "don't you make it harder 
for me&mdash;don't you fret." He paused from weakness, and
then added: "You are not to blame, and I don't mind 
it so much. I've often said as how I could die for <i>her;</i>
and it seems as if my wish has come, for him as has 
killed me won't be troubling of her no more."</p>

<p>Perry drew him closer to his heart as he said, "I wish 
it had been me, instead of you, poor fellow!"</p>

<p>"Don't say that, Perry. Uncle Mark and Aunt Susan
want you. I used to wish to go away from them. I 
was hankering after the 'song and dance'&mdash;but, now&mdash;I&mdash;am&mdash;going&mdash;where&mdash;I'll&mdash;get&mdash;what&mdash;I&mdash;want&mdash;I&mdash;reckon."</p>

<p>The eyes closed&mdash;a great weakness had come over him, 
for in spite of Perry's efforts his life was ebbing fast.</p>

<p>"It's all along of her. I stood it so long&mdash;the old 
shop&mdash;the searchings. Tell her my last breath was to 
pray for her, and give&mdash;my love&mdash;my&mdash;humble&mdash;love&mdash;Perry&mdash;I 
see them coming there&mdash;there&mdash;Lord, Lord!"</p>

<p>He raised his fading sight to heaven, and Perry's 
glance followed the direction of the dying boy's, to see 
only the vast blue dome with its myriad stars above them. 
He, who was putting on immortality alone possessed the 

<!-- page 380 -->

power to see the brightness which preceded the dawn 
of the new life, or to catch the vision of the green pastures 
and still waters. When Perry looked down again, 
the placid face was white and fixed, and the strong man 
wept aloud, holding the dead boy in his arms.</p>

<p>Faithful, honest Jope!&mdash;dear, tender heart! We mingle 
our tears with those which were shed for you, and 
say from our inmost heart, "Blessed is the man to whom 
the Lord hath not imputed sin, and in whose spirit there 
is no guile."</p>

<p class="small">"OH, PARDON ME FOR BRINGING THESE ILL NEWS."</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Glorious</span>, indeed, is the world of God around 
us; but more glorious the world of God within 
us." Mrs. Parrott laid her spectacles on the 
book&mdash;the gold-rimmed spectacles which John Maribel 
had given her on that Christmas morning so many years 
ago. There was the sound of a light footstep on the 
verandah, and while the old face brightened with expectation, 
her heart beat quicker with premonition of the 
heavy trial which awaited her. For days past she had 

<!-- page 381 -->

suffered the torture of suspense and dread; and when 
Agatha entered the room, agitation had taken away the 
power of uttering a word of welcome.</p>

<p>The full light from the chandelier fell upon the form of 
Agatha, as with quick, nervous motion, she threw off 
shawl and bonnet, and stooping to kiss the old woman, 
said:</p>

<p>"I have come to say good-by."</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrott only looked at her, to find in her haggard, 
bloodless face the realization of her worst fears.</p>

<p>"Agatha," she said, "how you torture my poor heart!
You know that my love has never yet failed you."</p>

<p>"It can avail me nothing now, mother," she cried, sinking 
on a seat beside Mrs. Parrott. "Oscar Featherstone 
lives."</p>

<p>The bitterness of her tone betrayed the hardening of a 
heart never keenly alive to virtuous instincts, and which 
in its renunciation of her child's love had lost its strongest 
incentive to good.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrott gently placed her hand upon the bent head 
crowned with heavy braids of black hair&mdash;the hair which 
was once of the glorious <i>biondina</i> hue, rarely seen, save in 
gorgeous Venetian pictures. Her touch came to the 
wretched woman like the breath of a benediction, soothing 
like the consolation which enters into the heart with 
the consciousness of human sympathy. A great sob 
arose in Agatho's throat; but she choked it down, determined 

<!-- page 382 -->

not to give way to the weakness of unavailing 
tears.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrott understood it all. The inexorable fiat of 
retribution had gone forth against this woman. She was 
condemned by the world and by society. The pen of a 
Dumas may clothe the deformity of vice in alluring 
colors; may convert the depraved Parisian <i>lorette</i> into an 
attractive decoy for unhealthy sentimentality. The
"moonlight of fancy" may raise a camellia-decked shrine;
but the laws of God stand firm&mdash;the gates of Eden are 
closed against those who violate them, and the Angel of 
Purity with glistening sword guards their approach. None 
knew better than Mrs. Parrott how slight is the tenure of 
the fallen upon the world's mercy. Not old Timon himself 
knew better than she, how under the ban of the 
world's condemnation one finds "the unkindest beast more 
kinder than mankind." Her thoughts went back to the 
old Italian city which had been her home when the 
strange adventure befell her which gave to her the child 
that in a great measure had compensated for that other 
joy of which her barren life had never tasted. Then she 
remembered how she had drawn from her love for this 
child, comfort and consolation in hours of fearful trial and 
grief; her first struggles with poverty, and the fierce combat 
with the cruel demon&mdash;starvation; and then, in natural 
sequence, the necessity which forced her to yield up her 
darling Agatha to the trials and temptations of the stage.</p>

<!-- page 383 -->

<p>To a woman like Agatha the profession was one of 
alluring temptation and dangerous fascination. The glare, 
the movement, the excitement of such a life, acted as a 
fatal stimulant upon her impetuous and passionate nature. 
Possessed of all which the world adulates, she soon learned 
to live in its smiles and to draw from its adulation a fatal 
and delicious enjoyment. A taste for luxury was engendered, 
and her wild extravagance brought on serious 
money troubles. At this juncture she met young Mr. 
Featherstone, a reputed millionaire, and by low intrigue 
and a shameful deception she inveigled him into a marriage. 
Then followed her brief married life and its scandalous 
denouement; then her abandonment of her child. 
At this point of retrospection the current of Mrs. Parrott's 
thoughts turned towards her own share in the outrage 
which John Maribel had suffered at their hands. Oh, would 
the attachment which had ripened during the long years of 
their association speak to John's heart in her behalf, and 
draw from the affluent kindness of his nature the forgiveness 
which she craved! A movement from Agatha 
startled her. She had, perhaps, grown impatient of the 
painful silence; or, more likely, could bear no longer the 
sting of her own thoughts, and had risen to her feet, 
apparently calm and quite self-possessed.</p>

<p>"Mother," she said, "believe me when I say that I am 
not ungrateful; and that while it costs me a sore pang to 
part from you, there is a certain satisfaction to me"&mdash;she

<!-- page 384 -->

smiled bitterly&mdash;"in knowing that your declining years 
may be spent apart from my own troubled and erring life. 
I don't know that I am acting wisely in prolonging it; but 
my craven heart refuses me the courage which is needful. 
I would rather face life with what it may have in 
store for me, than the horror of death with its appalling 
uncertainty."</p>

<p>"Oh, Agatha! have pity on me," cried the poor old woman, 
impotent to do more than raise her withered hands 
towards her wretched daughter in a gesture of entreaty.</p>

<p>"I pity you so much," continued Agatha passionately. 
"Why did you not let me die beside my mother? What 
tempted you to take a child to your heart, who was 
destined to be the shame and misery of your life? I pity 
you so much," she vehemently reiterated, "that I have determined 
never again to disturb the tranquillity of your 
life, never&mdash;never! You know me too well to suppose 
that I have played the part of a noble and disinterested 
heroine, who leaves her injured husband as poor as she 
came to him, with her wedding-ring suspended to a chain 
about her neck. No; I have brought away money and 
jewels, and with common prudence, may, at least for a 
while, live in comfort. No one need be friendless with a 
well-filled purse." She drew forth her jewelled watch.
The hour had expired which she had allotted for this interview&mdash;the 
moment of parting was one of terrible trial to 
her; and she stood with her teeth going deep into her 

<!-- page 385 -->

nether lip, her hands tightly clasped together, and her 
heart panged with remorseful regret as she gazed upon the 
livid, suffering face of her adoptive mother. With sudden 
violence she throw herself on her knees before her, and 
drawing down the old face to hers, kissed it passionately. 
She felt that, for the last time on earth, she was claiming 
a love which was pure and unselfish, and that this "parting 
was death, as far as life was concerned." Rising to 
her feet, she snatched her bonnet and shawl from the 
sofa on which she had thrown them, and went out, never 
turning once to look at the poor old woman, stricken and 
mute in her despair.</p>

towering pines moaning the requiem of the dead. So

with God and with Nature. No poet has immortalized its

elegy has been conceived within its hallowed precincts;

Gray has so beautifully expressed&mdash;memories which grow 
more tender and sacred with time&mdash;memories which make 
us better and holier, bringing us nearer to those friends who 
are waiting there for us.</p>

<p>Reverently we close the gate and pluck a spray from 
the woodbine which clambers over the hedge, turning to 
breathe a last farewell, and then go on our way through
forest road, overarched with meeting branches; across the 
mill brook, and down by the mill where the busy saw has 
ceased its humming, and the crystal water drips from the 
great wheel&mdash;by the old Featherstone house, standing 
gloomy in its solitude, and then over hills and through 
shadowy vales&mdash;by fields and smiling gardens with white 
houses rising in their midst, and gleaming lights and happy 
voices coming through open doors and windows&mdash;by the 
smith with its glowing forge&mdash;by the glaring new railway 
station, and then to the old inn under the china trees, 
all gold in their autumn hue&mdash;the queer old Red Tavern, 
just as it stood eighteen years ago, opening wide its hospitable 
doors and bidding us heartily welcome. The room 
within is all aglow with light from a blazing fire, which has 
been kindled to keep out the chill creeping in through open 
doors and windows; and good Triggs is there&mdash;we are 
glad to see him again&mdash;his round face suffused with smiles, 
and his rotund figure clothed in that <i>best</i> coat, which only 

<!-- page 387 -->

comes out of the cedar chest on rare and important occasions. 
If a trifle too tight, and somewhat antiquated in 
fashion, it is still as good as now, and the "old woman" 
is proud to see him wear it so bravely.</p>

<p>Mrs. Triggs has donned her smartest cap and new black 
alpaca, and is just now falling into ecstasies over Miss 
Catherine Featherstone, who looks exceedingly pretty in 
her travelling costume.</p>

<p>"Gracious goodness!" she exclaimed, "to think that 
this is the same, identical little thing&mdash;growed up as 
pretty as a rose. Don't things turn out? I'd hardly 
believe my eyes if I didn't see Dr. John a-standing looking 
so natural like"&mdash;which, by the by, was a mistake, 
for a sad face was quite unnatural to John Maribel; 
but Mrs. Triggs, being in such good spirits, saw him in 
all probability through the halo of her own cheerfulness. 
"Oh, sir!" she continued, turning to Mr. Featherstone, 
"if you had seen him, as likely a young man, 
and as fair-spoken as you ever set eyes on, a-warming 
of her little feet, and everybody a-looking and wondering. 
The stage stopped here in them days, sir; that's how 
Triggs and I are comfortable in our old age, and the 
passengers was all a-drinking and a-warming of themselves, 
and Dr. John was a-feeding of her with jam, and 
she said in the sweetest way, 'Oo's dood, John.' Dear me! 
It seems like I can't believe my eyes, only she's the same
pretty creature."</p>

<!-- page 388 -->

"I'll convince you of my identity, dear Mr. Triggs," 
laughed Kitty, "by acknowledging that I am still fond 
of jam, and that I have not changed my opinion about 
John."</p>

<p>"Bravo!" exclaimed Mr. Triggs, who looked as if he 
was about to propose a set of resolutions; but thinking 
better of it, instantly, with great heartiness, suggested 
that Dr. Maribel should run for Congress.</p>

<p>"I will be content with a much less decided and 
flattering expression of the good-will of my countrymen," 
answered John; "only let them continue to believe that 
I carry health in my saddle-bags and the best of intentions 
in my heart, and I shall be satisfied."</p>

<p>Kitty moved nearer to John and whispered, "Are you 
still obdurate?"</p>

<p>"Quite, Miss Featherstone," he said, assuming a playful 
tone. "Now that I have placed you in the hands of 
your respected father, and the terrible responsibility of 
your guardianship is taken from my shoulders, I must 
really think of poor Aunt Parrott and my patients, whom 
I have sadly neglected of late."</p>

<p>"I thought, dear John&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Kitty, think that I am your best and dearest 
friend." There was a husky tone in the voice, a moistening
of the eye&mdash;her little hand was clasped in his, and 
then suddenly dropped. A hasty good-by to Mr. Featherstone, 
a word to Ursule, and John Maribel was gone.

<!-- page 389 -->

Mr. and Mrs. Triggs watched him as he mounted his 
horse and rode away. Neither of them had spoken to 
him&mdash;there was that in his face which told them to 
respect his grief.</p>

<p>The mind accustomed to dwell upon the prospect of a 
beautiful future&mdash;to delight in the contemplation of those
joys which make life a refreshing walk towards the gardens 
of eternity, revolts at the sudden extinction of its cherished 
hopes, at the ruthless tearing up of those bright 
flowers of the heart that were budding to expand and 
blossom into maturity. John Maribel had set himself 
resolutely against the temptation of his love, and in his 
unselfish uprightness he was silent, leaving the fair 
Catherine Featherstone untrammelled to go forth into a 
world where she might find a more fitting mate than the 
middle-aged Doctor, who had little to offer her save a life-long 
love; and Kitty, her heart yet bleeding from the terrible 
treachery of De Ferri&egrave;re, and repentant of her great
weakness in his regard&mdash;her pride shocked and humbled&mdash;her 
young life clouded by the shadow of a mother's shame&mdash;beautiful, 
gifted, rich as she was, in the purity of her 
heart thought that an alliance with herself could scarcely 
be thought of by an honorable man; and it was, perhaps, 
this feeling which gave to their parting so sad and painful 
a significance. Love sometimes is born with a pang as 
sharp as death. Kitty knew this in after years, when this 
love, grown stronger with absence, proved to her a solace 

<!-- page 390 -->

under trials and afflictions, which neither wealth nor 
beauty, nor gifts of heart, nor treasures of intellect, can 
avert.</p>

<p>That night Kitty&mdash;we like best thus to call her&mdash;departed 
from Mapleton with her father and Ursule; Mr. 
and Mrs. Triggs accompanied them to the station.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" exclaimed the good woman, as Kitty 
waved them a last adieu, "She went away eighteen 
years ago. Dr. John carried her in his arms all the way 
to town&mdash;'twas Jim Perkins told me when he came back. 
You remember, husband, how it was snowing and sleeting, 
and the coldest night we've ever felt; and now she's
gone, not to come back, I reckon. It seems the 
Featherstones is unlucky; but she's the prettiest, winsomest 
young lady as I ever set eyes on, and it's a pity&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, wife?"</p>

<p>"It's a shame and a pity, to think of Dr. John a-riding 
through the lonely night away from his happiness. I saw 
it in his face, that I did, husband, as plain as I see you 
now; and I know that he was a-giving up his all when he 
said good-by to Kitty Featherstone."</p>

<p>CHAPTER LVII.</p>

<p class="small">"SO HUMBLY TAKE MY LEAVE."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Should</span> the requirements of a work of fiction 
have been satisfactorily fulfilled, the reader is 
supposed to be in a pleasurable condition of 
anxious suspense, and I will, therefore, at once proceed to 
fill up the interval of the six eventful years which have 
passed since John Maribel's parting from Kitty.</p>

<p>I am well convinced that there is "no part of knowledge 
in fewer hands than that of discerning when to have 
done. By the time that an author has written out a 
book, he and his readers are become old acquaintance, 
and grow very loth to part; so that I have sometimes 
known it to be in writing as in visiting, where the 
ceremony of taking leave has employed more time than 
the whole conversation before." I will bear this in mind, 
and endeavor to make our leave-taking as brief as possible, 
asking as a concluding favor a generous indulgence
should I have failed in that excellence which the antagonistic 
opinions of critical authorities has made somewhat 
difficult of definition. "Of all the cants which are canted 
in this canting world," says Sterne, "though the cant of 

<!-- page 392 -->

hypocrites may be the worse, the cant of criticism is 
most tormenting." But the world is full of human hearts 
affluent with generous sympathy, of human brains capable 
of that liberality of judgment which will enable them to 
discern, while they willingly lend themselves to the enjoyment 
which the author has done his best to afford. The 
pang of parting does not end with the spoken good-by.
Rivals spring up&mdash;rivals who take the place of old friends;
but memory is not always unfaithful&mdash;it reproduces with 
strange fidelity; and if in the future, dear reader, you 
can recall a pleasant hour spent over the pages which I 
have written, or revive your interest in the characters 
which I have portrayed, then parting, at least between us,
does not mean death.</p>

<p>From vine-covered hills and olive gardens with the 
white <i>Bastides</i> in their midst, we look down upon Marseilles. 
We see the teeming quays crowded with sailors 
of every nationality&mdash;a forest of masts towering from the 
port, and far out on the blue Mediterranean the wanton 
wind swells the graceful <i>latteen</i> beating its freighted bark 
towards the fair isles of the &AElig;gean sea, while the curving 
shores of the gulf of Lyons encircle the <i>Ch&acirc;teau</i> d'If, so 
fraught with historic interest as having been the prison of 
Mirabeau. While we are surveying the attractive scene, 
the steamer for Malta and Alexandria is receiving its 
freight and passengers, and the crowd gathered to witness 
its departure unmercifully jostles a man in shabby clothes, 

<!-- page 393 -->

whose haggard face is lit up by a pair of eager, hungry 
eyes, watching the carriages arriving with passengers from 
the East. There is a pressing forward of those behind, 
and the man is forced into close proximity to an elegantly 
attired woman, whose appearance has created the stir in 
the palpitating crowd. Her delicate hand, in its well-fitting 
pearl-gray glove rests upon the arm of a stout, sensual-looking 
man wearing a <i>fez</i>. The shabby man is so near 
to her that her rich costume brushes his worn and faded 
garments&mdash;so near that his whispered words fall clearly
upon her ear&mdash;so near that the delicate aroma of luxury
sweeps over his senses, scathing as a burning insult&mdash;bitter 
as death. She turns and looks at him for a moment with 
something of triumph in her glance, gathering her skirts 
away from him with a movement of disgust; at the same 
time she thrust her purse into his outstretched hand, saying: 
"I could have asked no better revenge than to give 
you alms."</p>

<p>When we take into consideration that this fabric of 
flesh and blood "is biased originally by the attributes and 
peculiarities of the fabric itself&mdash;by hereditary predispositions, 
by nervous idiosyncrasies, by cerebral development, 
by slow or quick action of the pulse, by all in which 
mind takes shape from the mould of the body," we cannot 
experience any great surprise at finding Agatha in company 
with an Egyptian officer, high in rank, belonging to 
the army of the Khedive. Her figure had expanded with a

<!-- page 394 -->

becoming roundness of <i>embonpoint</i>, and was set off by one
of those marvellous creations of the great Woman-Tempter, 
while her hair, rich in its original golden hue, needed no 
artificial means to give it a coloring which fashion loves to 
imitate. Captivating by the charm of irreproachable manner, 
seductive with that refined subtlety of worldly knowledge 
which gave her a power that she never abused, she had 
achieved the glaring reputation which caused men to stare 
at her when she rode in the <i>Bois</i>, and virtuous women to cast 
looks of curious interest on her flaunting luxury. The 
sword of Damocles hangs so long before falling that, in 
the case of such women, it seems altogether probable that 
some stronger support than a horse-hair retards the catastrophe. 
As long as they find slaves to serve their exquisite 
banquets, to cast jewels and gold at their feet, to 
offer them the poisonous incense of flattery, and to furnish 
the "purple couch" upon which they repose in arrogant 
security, so long will they refrain from lifting their eyes 
to the menacing doom&mdash;so long will they have immunity 
from punishment. About six months after Agatha's arrival 
in Egypt, during a review, an American officer in the 
service of the Khedive, attracted, doubtless, by her brilliant 
person, passed near to the carriage in which she sat. This 
man bore on his noble face the ineffaceable marks of care
and sorrow, and his grizzled hair and beard contrasted 
strongly with the dark hue of his complexion bronzed by the 
ardent rays of an Egyptian sun. So changed were they both 

<!-- page 395 -->

in appearance, that recognition seemed scarcely possible;
and yet their eyes meeting, by some mystical <i>rapport</i>, 
there was a flash of consciousness which caused the woman 
to grow pale beneath her rouge, and the man to wheel his 
horse so violently around, pressing the spurs with fury 
into his sides, that the bystanders made way before him 
in the greatest consternation.</p>

<p>In a distant land, an exile from a ruined home&mdash;even 
here Wilbraham found renewed evidence of the mistake 
of his youth, in the insolent presence of this woman.</p>

<div class="center" id="ch58">

<p>CHAPTER LVIII.</p>

<p class="small">"O GENTLE PROTEUS! LOVE'S A MIGHTY LORD."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no telling where the influence of a bad 
life ends. Death itself is no safeguard against the 
insidious poison, which is as fatal to human happiness 
as is the deadly nightshade to human life; and thus 
it happened that Catherine Featherstone, in her luxurious 
London home, with all the world <i>&agrave; genoux</i> before her, was 
continually tormented by a gaunt skeleton which did not 
confine itself to its closet, but went stalking about, thrusting 

<!-- page 396 -->

its horrid fingers in the face of every pleasure, sitting 
down at feasts, and mocking even at love itself. A great 
doctor was sent for; he, of course, knew nothing about the 
skeleton, and was a little puzzled to account for the young 
lady's loss of spirits, and want of appetite for the good 
things of life with which she was so abundantly supplied. 
He prescribed a tonic and change, so that these unfortunate 
people must perforce set out to seek for that which 
the doctor never dreamed that they wanted.</p>

<p>Kitty&mdash;for to us she must always be Kitty&mdash;protested 
against any more journeyings on the Continent. The 
thought of Paris was absolutely abhorrent to her. One
day, in the <i>Bois</i>, she had met her skeleton, and it was after 
this <i>rencontre</i> that they had gone to London to live.</p>

<p>As poor Mr. Featherstone had often done before, he 
called Ursule into council.</p>

<p>"Where to go, <i>monsieur?</i>" she exclaimed; "as if you 
cannot see that <i>Mademoiselle</i> is bored by all these people&mdash;that 
she is longing and pining to go back to America,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know what you would say, Ursule," he interrupted 
impatiently. "It is quite absurd to imagine that Catherine 
entertains other than an affectionate remembrance of 
Dr. Maribel."</p>

<p>"<i>Pardon, monsieur,</i> but you are a father, and I can well 
understand that you look to Miss Featherstone's making 
a match suitable to her position. Six years work great 

<!-- page 397 -->

changes in people&mdash;and such years as those six have been 
over there in America! Perhaps when <i>Mademoiselle</i> has 
seen Dr. Maribel, she will find that she can love Sir 
Michael Maxton without doing violence to her affection 
for him."</p>

<p>In the case of most young ladies, Ursule's reasoning 
would have applied; but it was quite a different matter 
with one who was obstinately and absurdly bent upon 
loving a middle-aged doctor, and who remembered now 
with bitter regret how little she had valued the great love 
wherewith he had loved her.</p>

<p>To Miss Featherstone's secret delight, it was settled 
that they were to return to America, and from that moment 
so wonderful a change came over her that the doctor declared 
that he had never known his favorite tonic to work
so prompt a cure. Kitty laughed. She had not tasted of 
the tonic for a week; but day and night she was thinking 
of dear old John, and of the pleasant surprise which she 
had in store for him. When we think that she had had 
no news of him for four years, we cannot but admire her 
beautiful faith in his love and her confidence that God had 
taken him in his care. <i>Omnia vincit amor</i>.</p>

<p>The steamer was passing through the gateway leading 
to the grand and mighty metropolis of America. The 
deck was crowded with passengers, and exclamations in 
German, French, Italian and Spanish attested their delight
in the unrivalled approach to New York. The shores of 

<!-- page 398 -->

Long Island and New Jersey were shimmering in the clear 
sunlight, and the curving hills of Staten Island lay blue 
in the distance. The water was leaping and foaming about 
the great black hulk that moved onward towards the swarming 
wharf, where a bustling, eager multitude awaited those 
coming from across the sea. Kitty took in each detail 
with silent delight. Now that the great rolling ocean 
separated her from her skeleton, she breathed more freely, 
and gave herself up to pleasurable thoughts and anticipations. 
In the wild freshness of the breeze, with life and 
movement all about her, her eyes sparkled, the crimson
lips curved into smiles, the color mantled her cheek, until 
more than one eye turned in admiration upon the beautiful 
American girl.</p>

<p>CHAPTER LIX.</p>

<p class="small">"SUCH IS THE FULNESS OF MY HEART'S CONTENT."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> will leave Mr. and Miss Featherstone to find 
their way to the hotel, and satisfying ourselves 
by reference to the morning <i>Herald</i> that we have 
the right address, set out to seek the office of our dear 

<!-- page 399 -->

old friend John Maribel. We ring the bell, and are ushered 
into a shabby little waiting-room. Just at this moment 
the Doctor is engaged with a patient. His hand 
rests upon the curly head of a pale boy seated on his 
mother's lap&mdash;his left hand, for the sleeve of the right arm 
hangs empty. From the window the light falls on his 
face&mdash;the same bright, honest face, with its clear blue eyes 
and we are surprised that he looks no older. As if a fairy 
breath had blown a mist of powder towards him, which 
had gently settled on his close-curling locks, they are 
whitened, and disordered as of yore, from the trick which 
he has not lost, of thrusting his fingers through them.</p>

<p>Untying the corner of her pocket-handkerchief, the 
woman takes out her little fee, and offers it to the Doctor, 
who holds his hand a little eagerly, the woman thinks, 
with a sigh of disappointment. He had spoken so kindly 
to her that she thought, perhaps&mdash;&mdash; Well, never mind. 
He had turned his back upon her, and we see him take a 
stick of candy from a jar on the mantel-shelf, and wrap it, 
together with the money, in a piece of brown paper; and 
then, with a most unconscious air, place it in the poor 
little hand of the sick child, saying: "There, Franky, 
don't make yourself sick by eating the whole at one time.
Candy is good to take the taste of medicine out of a little 
boy's mouth. You'll bring him again, Mrs. Mohan, the 
day after to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and God bless you!" for Franky, with 

<!-- page 400 -->

childish eagerness, had opened the paper and she saw 
what the good Doctor had done.</p>

<p>Oh, John, John! By how many hundreds of such 
actions have you sunk your stock in trade! and really, are 
the returns available? I think that I see his blue eyes 
turning towards us in reproachful remonstrance.</p>

<p class="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>One night, not so very many years ago&mdash;a night marked 
by an awful calamity&mdash;the mocking moonlight stole through 
the tangled copses of the Wilderness, revealing masses moving 
into position and preparing for the day's bloody struggle. 
A mighty chieftain, the soul and mainspring of the
gathering hosts; directed this movement in face of an 
enemy on the <i>qui vive</i>, with guns ready to belch forth their 
murderous fire. Within an hour from that time he had 
fallen, and amid the roar of artillery, the tramp of terrified 
horses galloping wildly away from their riders, who 
were left moaning and dying, lying helpless under the 
burning hail of grape and canister, the hero, surnamed 
Stonewall, was being borne through the dense wood where 
treacherous grape-vines wound about the feet of the men 
hearing his litter, throwing them to the earth and adding 
to the horror of the hour a terrible chance of death, there 
in the tangled wilderness, to the captain of many battles. 
Finding further progress impracticable, the sorrowing and 
anxious <i>cort&egrave;ge</i> turned into the road, and as they passed 
they diverged in order to avoid a body lying in their path.

<!-- page 401 -->

In their absorbing anxiety to reach a place of safety with 
their beloved general, these men scarce gave a thought to 
their wounded comrade, and for hours of that horrible 
night this man lay there conscious of his awful danger, 
hearing with ineffable dread the approaching tramp of 
maddened horses, the terrific explosion of shells which 
tore into more agonizing wounds the already mutilated 
bodies of the fallen. With almost superhuman exertion 
he had managed to drag himself into the wood, thinking 
to find protection from the sheltering trees; but here again 
death in its most horrible form menaced him. An ominous 
crackling, a deep, sullen roar, apprised him of his 
danger. The forest was on fire. Lurid light shone upon 
dying, upturned faces, and the lapping flames enveloped 
with greedy lust forms quivering in their death-throes, 
cruelly lacerated and half torn to pieces.</p>

<p>A great tongue of fire shot out towards the cedar under 
which this man lay, a sharp heat like the breath of some 
vengeful demon touched his cheek, from the frizzling 
branches hot sparks fell in showers upon him. Face to 
face with an appalling death, half stifled, scorched and 
bleeding, he lay trying to resign his soul into the hands of 
Him who know best why He made death so hard to him.
He closed his eyes; it was too horrible! In all probability 
he fainted, for he was quite unconscious of being half 
dragged, half carried from the wood, and of a familiar 
voice calling upon him in tones of despairing and affectionate

<!-- page 402 -->

grief. Indeed, for many days afterwards he knew 
no one and remembered nothing of all this horror. His 
first consciousness of life came to him with a sense of the 
loss of his right arm, and then he knew the man who sat 
beside him with bandaged face and hair scorched from off 
his head.</p>

<p>"Dear old fellow! you have been hurt," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Nothing to speak of. Don't talk, the surgeon says 
you mustn't."</p>

<p>As the days wore on, the memory of it all came back to 
him, and he learned how the man who nursed him day and 
night had saved him from the flames at the risk of his own. 
life. This man was very silent about what he had done. 
He found his recompense in the looks which followed him 
with affectionate gratitude; in the tones which softened 
towards him with gentle pathos; in the silent pressure of 
the poor left hand. The day came when the man with 
the scarred face was ordered back to his regiment, and he 
who had lost his arm resigned his commission as colonel 
and applied for that of surgeon, that he might remain in 
the hospital. The poor fellows suffering from wounds and 
disease soon learned to appreciate his skill, and to take 
comfort in their multiform trials from his ever-cheerful 
words and patient example.</p>

<p>You have doubtless guessed who these men were. John 
Maribel is easily recognized; but, perhaps, you scarcely 
suppose the taciturn carpenter, Perry Deane, capable of 

<!-- page 403 -->

that exalted friendship which was faithful even unto death. 
Poor fellow! he was brought back to the hospital only a 
very few days after his departure thence, with both legs 
shattered and his life fast ebbing. Then "the boys" saw
their good doctor stricken with poignant grief, and during 
the few hours which were left to Perry a respectful silence
reigned throughout the vast dormitory, where so many 
others lay suffering and dying. The whispered "good-by" 
reached only the ear which was bent down to catch 
it, and with his hand firmly clasped in John's, the brave, 
humble man passed from a world which he did not regret, 
into that rest which to him was the satisfaction of long 
yearning&mdash;the casting off of a burthen grown heavier with 
the agonizing sense that life, if granted to him, would be 
but a hard submission to helplessness which might endanger 
the fidelity which consists in perfect obedience to that 
superior law which governs life.</p>

<p class="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Loneliness is an unpleasant companion to a man menaced 
with discouragement, and discouragement is the reflex 
of that good which exists in the human heart, and may 
lead to rebellion under an awakened sense of injustice. We 
will assume a privilege which is our own by virtue of our 
<i>m&eacute;tier</i>, and look over John Maribel's shoulder while he 
reads the letters which the postman has just left. They 
have, perhaps, aroused in him that active, human sympathy 
which is so strongly opposed to selfish repining, for 

<!-- page 404 -->

his face is expressive of grief and his hand trembles, making 
it difficult for the tearful eyes to discern the written 
characters. We read as follows:</p>

<br/>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear John</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your letter found me most comfortably lodged in the 
<i>Rue Ch&acirc;teaubriand, Champs &Eacute;lys&eacute;es</i>, but Fate has again 
played me a spiteful trick, and Happiness, that, deceitful 
jade, has fled, leaving me the unpleasant consciousness of 
having committed an egregious folly. Ah, John! how 
often the fierce school-dame, Experience, raps our knuckles 
in this little preparatory school, the world, and how stupidly 
we blunder on, little wiser for the correction. We 
learn at last how insignificant is the scope of this life 
compared to the infinity which stretches in awful magnitude 
beyond our mortal ken, far into the realms of Eternity. 
I stand now, John, on the borders of the valley 
which has pierced my heart with dread. Weak, uncertain, 
limited, full of imperfections is our nature, yet so 
inwrought with the inspiration of the Almighty that 
immortality becomes a fixed certainty to the soul, and the 
hope which it creates is our highest incentive to perfection.
It is glorious to believe, John, that a wholly new 
and higher order of mental faculties will spring from the 
sub-strata of mortality, and that I shall be keenly alive 
then as now to those enjoyments which have filled up so 
large a portion of my life. You deem these speculations 

<!-- page 405 -->

idle! Well, perhaps the faculties which serve us here 
may not be put to analogous uses hereafter; but have 
you ever conceived of the developments of the high 
order of intellectual faculties, and of the exquisite enjoyment 
which may be derived from their full exercise. Am 
I an old Greek heathen, thinking of and prizing only the 
purely intellectual? No, no, John! A poor, weak old 
woman only, whose speculations have at last resolved. 
themselves into a firm belief in her own worthlessness, 
and an humble trust in Him who assumed mortality for 
her sake. Speculation takes a weary course in and out 
and around truth, and rarely arrives at a conclusion which 
is not disputable. Pluck truth from the bottom of its 
well, and an army of <i>isms</i> will at once attack it, pulling it 
back and sinking it into profounder depths. I have been 
lugging at it all my life, with what result&mdash;how much 
wiser am I than Nellie Shea? A very fool in comparison, 
you will say, when I tell you that, unheeding her sound 
advice, I undertook, at my advanced age, the journey to 
Paris, to find the last bitter dregs of that cup which Fate 
has with spiteful persistency so often pressed to my
unwilling lips.</p>

<p>"I am a very old woman, John, and my experience of 
life is, I hope, an exceptional one, for I find it hard to 
count my happy days; and even those were cheats, decked 
out in the tinselled finery of anticipation. It is difficult 
to conceive of a more serious calamity than that which 

<!-- page 406 -->

overwhelms a heart which screens itself behind the demi-obscurity 
of its &aelig;sthetic love for the beautiful in art as in 
nature, and through the soothing, mellow half-lights 
transfers to all things an unreality which clouds our mental 
vision from the rugged truth with regard to the moral 
defects of those whom we love. You understand me, John,&mdash;you 
know why I have garnered no treasures of wisdom.
Poor, foolish, doting old woman! I am weeping amid 
my ruins, John; but from the shattered mass I have preserved 
one inestimable treasure&mdash;your love, John, and 
your forgiveness. Each day the reality of your self-denying 
generosity is palpable in the comforts which your allowance&mdash;liberal, 
I fear, John, beyond your present means&mdash;enables 
me to obtain.</p>

<p>"During the first days of my stay here I was conscious 
of a certain repression in Nellie's manner which created 
an unpleasant suspicion of a possible sense of triumph in 
the accomplishment of certain oft-repeated predictions; 
but when she witnessed my sorrow, John, how many innocent 
arts did she practise to conceal from me the bitter 
humiliation of knowing how much of the truth she comprehended.</p>

<p>"God in fashioning His creatures has often departed from 
the rules of beauty and symmetry and left the exterior of 
his wonderful creation without ornament, to expend a 
larger share of His divine workmanship upon the soul 
which adorns and glorifies the interior. He has prepared 

<!-- page 407 -->

surprises for us everywhere. We do not discover them, 
because we wilfully ignore the possibility of a successful 
search. You know, John, that I have lived untrammelled 
by creeds. Some foolish people have called me an unbeliever; 
but I little heeded opinions which I knew to be 
slightly allied to conviction, or doctrine which was but 
the easy-fitting garb of habit. I have at least been sincere 
towards myself, and I have strong faith in the principles 
of ever-ruling mercy which tempers severity of 
judgment. Vindictiveness can have no part in the attributes 
of the Almighty, and the soul involuntarily, unconsciously 
yearning for light, will have its yearning satisfied. 
I am but a poor atom of that great and glorious Unity&mdash;God's 
Universe&mdash;and in the eternal evolution of mysteries 
I will have my share of enlightenment which will bring 
my soul into companionship with those who have beheld 
'a day new-risen.' The dawn of that day is near&mdash;very 
near, John.</p>

<p>"Eighty-three years! As I look back from the portals 
of Eternity&mdash;for they are opening for me&mdash;how brief 
they seem and yet each moment of those years must influence, 
more or less, that supreme ending which brings us 
to the threshold of a great and glorious beginning.</p>

<p>"Dear John Maribel, true and faithful friend, good-by.</p>

<p class="right">"Lovingly and gratefully,</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Frances</span>."</p> 

<br/>

<!-- page 408 -->

<p>The effort to sign the name which for so many years 
she had renounced was probably the last one of her life. 
John Maribel reverently folds this touching adieu, and 
takes the other letter from the table. It is from Nellie 
Shea, and has evidently been indited under great mental 
tribulation.</p>

<br/>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir and Honored Doctor</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"She as was ground in her opinions to the end, and kept 
her mind to write to you the last words she ever spoke, 
dropped off without so much as giving me warning; as 
how should she, when she was called that suddint as 
never to speak a word to me as has served her faithful. 
She's dead and buried. The doctor said it was heart disease; 
but there's heart disease and heart disease, and the 
worse kind is when it comes on with shame and trouble 
as them who should love and honor brings it. It's just 
a crack and a snap, and all is over. I've known two good 
women to go off with it&mdash;Miss Eleanor and her as I can't 
bear to write her name; and <i>she</i> as caused all this trouble 
is a-riding in carriages, dressed in satins and silks, with 
her hair shining like gold, and as much like another woman
as the same woman can be. <i>She</i> can laugh and sing, and 
them two dead, and the living ones a-holding down their 
heads in shame. The funeral was every way proper. I 
am free to say it would have been more agreeable to my

own feelings, and I know acceptable to yours, to have 
done otherwise, that is, plain and decent, but paid for 
honest, as I am sure nothing is; as we run a wild-goose 
chase, to come to with tossing and sickness as never was&mdash;and 
miles and miles of it with never a minute of satisfaction 
to be got. I'll bless the day when I set foot again 
on your door-step, which I know you need a careful 
woman to look after you, as never could look out for 
yourself.</p>

<p>"She as I would rather not mention has acted handsome; 
but I never touched a dollar. I sent it back. I 
am no hand at writing. My poor old mistress tried hard 
to teach me; but I've always had a stupid head for 
learning, and so, as in duty bound, I'll wait to tell you
more when I see you, as will be soon, if I live to get back, 
which chances stand against me.</p>

<p>"With duty and respect, and hoping there's no mistake 
about the address, I am,</p>

<p class="right">"Your faithful servant,</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Nellie Shea</span>."</p> 

<br/>

<p>The most docile ox will shrink from the galling yoke,
and prospective bondage is scarcely cheering to a man 
who values the privilege of freedom from feminine interference. 
A lingering look around his little office, a sigh 
which was, perhaps, not altogether unmingled with the 

<!-- page 410 -->

consciousness of just that need which Nellie could supply, 
and a thrust of his hand through his hair, were indications 
of growing incredulity in the compensation which was to 
mete out to him his share of the good things of life. Dr. 
Maribel leaned back in his arm-chair, his hair looking 
whiter in contrast with the much worn crimson velvet 
covering; but his face had already regained its habitual 
repose, any prolonged annoyance being impossible to his 
generous nature, which quickly revolted from the thraldom 
of a purely selfish idea. Hope is a persistent friend
to such a man, and he is apt to lend a willing ear to the 
sweet-tongued messenger. While she whispers to him, 
dainty feet are tripping up the dusty stairs, they linger a 
moment on the landing, and then a delicate hand turns the 
lock, the door opens, and a beautiful face, warm with 
blushes and beaming with joy, is close to his. He hears 
the sweet familiar greeting, "John, dear John!"&mdash;he is 
conscious only of an unutterable joy as he touches those 
upturned lips quivering with love for him. There was a 
great deal of compensation in that kiss; but with sharp 
and sudden pain the revulsion came. He drew away the 
tender arms which were clinging to him, and Catherine 
Featherstone comprehended the whole meaning of his 
action&mdash;the delicate pride which shrank from acceptance, 
when he had so little, according to his own way of 
judging, to give in return.</p>

<p>"John," she said, "I thought you would have understood 
my coming, and the great need for your love and 
protection which has impelled me to infringe, perhaps, 
the rules of strict propriety and modesty."</p>

<p>"My darling, my darling!" he cried, "have you come 
to give your sweet life to a man, poor, maimed, and old 
enough to be your father? Oh! Kitty, do you ask me 
to believe this?"</p>

<p>"Yes John," she answered, looking directly at him. 
Those meeting eyes read deep into each other's hearts, 
the impassioned glance had brought "Two spirits to one 
equal mind." The woman, with beautiful trust in the 
man's great heart, has come to him, conscious that in his 
love she would risk no possible danger. Her innocence 
and purity would be safe from suspicion of possible 
transgression&mdash;for such is the legacy which wicked 
mothers leave to their daughters&mdash;and her life with John 
Maribel offered to her constant nature all that she had 
ever understood of perfect earthly happiness. There was 
in him a consciousness of power to protect, a strong conviction 
of what was best for her, an unutterable gratitude 
for this other dearer life, for the radiant presence which 
would henceforth illumine his home.</p>

<p>Mr. Featherstone had quietly entered the adjoining 
room. He came forward now, holding out both hands to 
John, exclaiming: "God bless you, my dear and faithful 

<!-- page 412 -->

friend! Forgive me, my child," he continued, turning 
to the blushing girl, "forgive me for having been unfaithful, 
even in thought, to this noble man whom you 
have wisely chosen."</p>
