<p class="center">THE HISTORY OF THE MYSTERY OF ALBERT LUNEL,<br/>

<span class="smcap">By the late Lord Brougham</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> few works have made so great a sensation in the literary world
as Albert Lunel! It will be seen by the following extracts that the
authorship is indisputable. At the time the work came into my hands
I was given to understand that Lord Brougham wrote it in 1844, but
suppressed it for private reasons at an early date.</p>

<p><i>The Figaro</i> became indignant at my claiming his late lordship as the
author, but it is evident that the reviewer did not take the trouble to
read the work, but exhausted his energies in penning a sensational
article, in which, as will be seen below, he threw down the gauntlet,
using some very questionable terms with respect to myself as the
publisher.</p>

<p>I wrote a letter, about half of which was inserted, in which I declared
that my object was to produce to the world a literary curiosity, and I
repeat it.</p>

<p>In an extract from "Notes and Queries," it will be seen that a letter
appeared in the "Spectator" signed "Georgiana Chatterton," who
declares that she received a copy of "Albert Lunel" from Mr. Rogers as
the work of Lord Brougham.</p>

<p>Olphar Hamst, a correspondent to "Notes and Queries" declares that
he has conclusive evidence of the authorship, and the entire press
recognise the style of the great man whose name, but a few years back,
rang throughout the world.</p>

<p>As the work created so great an interest before it received a genuine
circulation, it cannot fail to excite the curiosity of the reading public in
whose hands I leave it now, satisfied that a work from the pen of so
great a man must possess a more than common interest.</p>

<p>I deny, as I did in my letter to the "Figaro" that anything
objectionable exists in the work.</p>

<p>It is a novel betraying eccentricity of genius, the production of a man
deep souled, romantic, and visionary.</p>

<p class="center">"FIGARO," <span class="smcap">Oct</span>. 5, 1872.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trading on the Dead</span>.&mdash;We have received "Albert Lunel" a three-volume 
novel, published by Mr. Charles H. Clarke, of Paternoster-row,
which, according to the preface, "was written by the late Lord Brougham,
in the year 1844, but, for private reasons of his lordship's, was not
published."</p>

<p>Literary criticism is out of the question. Worse trash was never
printed. The plot and the style vie with each other in stupidity. We
have not read the whole of the novel. The fourth chapter of the first
volume, which savours of Holywell-street abominations, is sufficient to
stamp the character of the book. It is a stupidly coarse account of
seduction by a monk.</p>

<p>We do not say that the late Lord Brougham did not write "Albert
Lunel," but we shall not believe that he did so, unless very weighty
evidence is adduced. It is a gross impertinence to ascribe this miserable
production to the late Lord Brougham, without at the same time offering
some proof of the assertion.</p>

<p>Suppose that a Holywell-street dealer in obscene prints asserted that
some of his loathsome prints were the designs of the late John Leech.
We could not prove a negative; but, in the absence of confirmatory
proof, we should, without hesitation, declare that the statement was a
malicious falsehood. So, when such contemptible twaddle is ascribed to
the pen of the late Lord Brougham, we shall hold that the name on the
title page is an imposition, until some evidence is brought forward to
uphold the startling statement.</p>

<p>But, even on the assumption that the late Lord Brougham penned
such ditchwater balderdash as "Albert Lunell" the publication of the
novel is a disgraceful and ignoble act. If Lord Brougham deemed it
expedient not to publish it, who can have a right to publish it after his
death, except by express testamentary authority? By the way, "Albert
Lunel" was printed many years ago, and, as we are informed, formally
repudiated by the late Lord Brougham.</p>

<p>The graveyard can be left ungarded. The most barbarous and the
most debased of mankind have an instinct of respect for the dead. But
it seems that there are persons who do not object to trading on the
reputation of the dead.</p>

<p>If we were the executors of the late Lord Brougham, we would compel 
Mr. Charles H. Clarke to prove that "Albert Lunel" was written by
the late Lord Brougham; and, if he succeeded in so doing, we should
compel him to prove how he acquired a legal right to publish the book.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we say that even if "Albert Lunel' was written by
the late Lord Brougham, it is a shameful instance of trading on the
reputation of the illustrious dead, to publish a work that the author
declined to have published.</p>

<p>But we do not believe in the unsupported statement of Mr. Charles
H. Clarke, that "Albert Lunel" was written by the late Lord Brougham;
and we direct the attention of the present Lord Brougham to the use
made of his dead brother's name.</p>

<p class="center">"FIGARO," <span class="smcap">Oct</span>. 12, 1872.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert Lunel.&mdash;to the editor of figaro</span>.&mdash;Sir, My attention has
been called to an article in relation to myself, which appeared in your
paper, last week. You anathematise me for publishing a novel written
by the late Lord Brougham. Allow me to inform you that the book
in question was sold by the present owner of the title, who, at the
time, wrote the subjoined letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="right">21, Berkeley Square, 29th Nov., 1871.</p>

<p>I hereby undertake to make no claim in respect of copyright, and not to take,
or permit to be taken, any proceedings at law or equity against Mr. Thomas
Millard, in the event of his reprinting in any form he may think fit the book
called "<span class="smcap">Albert Lunel</span>."</p>

<p class="right">(Signed) <span class="smcap">Brougham and Vaux</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>I have purchased from Mr. Thomas Millard all his interest in the
above work, and if Lord Brougham's executors have no objection to the
publication of a posthumous book, surely I am not to blame for giving
to the world what is, in reality, a literary curiosity. The author may
have withdrawn it from publication, owing to a nervous dread of hostile
criticism. Possibly, the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> of those days was the prototype of
the <span class="smcap">Figaro</span>; but it seems to me, that anything written by a great man
must possess a world-wide interest. I deny that there is anything
objectionable in the book, and I contend that, if there were, it should
be regarded as the eccentricity of genius, for which I, as the publisher,
am not in any way responsible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Brougham's Novel</span>.&mdash;On the authorship of <i>Albert Lunel</i> the
following letter, signed "Georgiana Chatterton " appears in the <i>Spectator:</i>&mdash;"As 
the authorship of <i>Albert Lunel</i> is now being discussed, it
may not be amiss if I state what came under my own knowledge
respecting that novel. I was with Mr. Rogers at one of his well-known
little breakfast parties when <i>Albert Lunel</i> was brought to him from
Lord Brougham. He gave it to me to read, as he often did when he
had not time to begin a new book at once, charging me to read it
quickly, and not to say who had written it. I did so, and finished it by
the time I went to a dinner party, on the following day. In the evening 
I met Mr. Rogers, and he told me that he had sent to my house for
the book, as Lord Brougham had ordered it to be suppressed, the
reason (as he had heard) being that many of the characters were from
real life. I have never met with anyone who had read it before its
suppression, except the late Dean Milman&mdash;nor since its suppression&mdash;till 
within the last few months."</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"NOTES AND QUERIES," Aug. 16, 1873.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert Lunel</span>.&mdash;The <i>Figaro</i> of the 31st of May last, in a notice of
my <i>Bibliographical List of Lord Brougham's Works</i>, observed that I
had rejected all doubtful publications, including a "resuscitated novel."

<!-- page 4 -->

The <i>Figaro</i> was quite right. When I wrote the above list I was of
opinion that <i>Albert Lunel</i> was not by Lord Brougham. I am now of
opinion that Lord Brougham was the author of <i>Albert Lunel</i>, and that
there can be no doubt about the matter.</p>

<p>In your last volume <span class="smcap">Mr. Bates</span> concluded one of his exhaustive and
interesting notes by asking, Who was the author? He, apparently, had
not personally inspected the "privately-printed volume" he refers to
(No. 133 in my <i>List</i>). It conclusively proves Lord Brougham to be the
author, without the corroborative evidence I have since obtained. In
one of his letters Lord Brougham says he obtained Mr. Rogers's copy
from his executors; and on p. 71 that he had 1,000 locked up in a
cellar.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Olphar Hamst</span>.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"LIVERPOOL MERCURY."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Puzzle for the Critics</span>.&mdash;A controversy has arisen in literary
circles, which, as affecting the character of a man whose memory
belongs to the nation at large rather than to any given section of it,
possesses a wider interest than such controversies generally do. The
question is, did the late Lord Brougham write a novel called "Albert
Lunel," just issued with his name on the title page? The only voucher
for the authenticity of the authorship contained in the work itself is
the following brief note facing the title&mdash;" 'Albert-Lunel' was written
by the late Lord Brougham in the year 1844, but, for private reasons of
his lordship, was not published." For the rest, though the title page
and the binding are new, the body of the work, as is evident from the
colour of the paper and ink, has been in existence for some years.
Moreover, it bears the imprint of the firm who printed for the late
Lord Brougham's publishers. This is all the evidence furnished by the
work itself&mdash;except, of course, the literary evidence of matter, style,
and so on, to which we shall refer presently. The book having, immediately 
on its publication, been pronounced by one journal to be an
imposition, the publisher wrote to the editor to say that he had purchased 
it of a Mr. Thomas Millard, who, in his turn, had bought it of
the present Lord Brougham, who gave him on the completion of the
purchase, the following "undertaking"&mdash;"21, Berkeley-square, 29th
Nov., 1871.&mdash;I hereby undertake to make no claim in respect of copyright, 
and not to take, or permit to be taken, any proceedings at law or
equity against Mr. Thomas Millard in the event of his reprinting in any
form he may think fit the book called 'Albert Lunel.' (Signed)
<span class="smcap">Brougham and Vaux</span>." Since this, nothing further has been done in
proof of authenticity; so that, so far as the publisher is concerned, we
are supposed to take it for granted, on the <i>ipse dixit</i> of an unknown
person, backed up by the declaration of the present Lord Brougham
that he will not claim the copyright of "<i>the</i> book"&mdash;not his brother's
book, you mark&mdash;that "Albert Lunel" was written by the late Lord
Brougham. What wonder that the critics should be sceptical? especially 
when they found on referring to the book itself a dedication to

<!-- page 5 -->

Samuel Rogers beginning thus&mdash;"It is natural that the countenance of
a great name, the certainty of obtaining an enlightened reader, the
benefit of having a candid though severe critic, should be sought by one
<i>who has no name at all!</i>" This, from Lord Brougham in 1844, after all
England had rung with his name for four and twenty years, and when
it had been long known in politics and science the wide world over.
But this is not all. The unknown author goes on&mdash;"Should such an
accident ever happen as your indulging in any curiosity upon so trifling
a matter, you will find the mystery in which your unknown admirer is
wrapped impossible to pierce. Your sagacity may, from internal evidence, 
serve to point a conjecture towards France and her colonies as
his country&mdash;her language as that in which his book may have been
written." Lord Brougham was not a Frenchman, nor did he hail from
a French colony, nor was it likely that he would write a novel in French
for the mere pleasure of re-writing it into English before publishing it.
There is little doubt after all that Lord Brougham did write "Albert
Lunel." Turning to the 1856 edition of "Men of the Time" we find
a notice of Lord Brougham, the leading facts in which would, in
ordinary course, be either furnished by his lordship or submitted to his
correction; and in that notice, winding up the catalogue of his literary
works, is this sentence "His lordship has also published a novel, which
he suppressed after a few copies had been disposed of." Thus far we
have evidence of "a novel." For the name of it we turn to M'Gilchrist's 
"Life and Career of Henry Lord Brougham" published by
Cassell and Co. immediately after Lord Brougham's death in 1868. At
page 245 we find this passage "In 1844 a novel was published,
entitled (we think) 'Albert Lunel, or the Ch&acirc;teau of Languedoc.' It
was withdrawn from sale after a few days' circulation. It is believed
that Brougham wrote it. We think there can be no doubt of it; for
we know that Lord Jeffrey, who was most likely to be correctly informed,
had it bound uniformly with the works of his friend, and set beside
them in his library." That the "novel" of "Men of the Time" and
the "Albert Lunel, or the Ch&acirc;teau of Languedoc" of Mr. M'Gilchrist,
are one and the same book, we cannot very well doubt. It is equally
clear, we think, that the "Albert Lunel, or the Ch&acirc;teau of Languedoc"
of Mr. M'Gilchrist, is identical with the "Albert Lunel" just issued
by Mr. Clarke, for it so happens that throughout the greater part
of the story the scene is laid in a ch&acirc;teau in Languedoc. Besides,
Brougham did not write the novel for the plot. The highly melodramatic 
hero, the crafty villain, the usual consumptive young lady,
the wicked countess, the all-accomplished baron, the constant though
persecuted heroine, are all but so many pegs of which the author
makes ill use to expose his views upon philosophy, art, literature,
history, and science physical, political, moral, and social. It is here
that we find unmistakable traces of the great restless mind that
"ransacked the universe for topics of speculation" The quality
of the thought, equally with the diction in which it is clothed,
is pure Brougham&mdash;not the Brougham of 1844, but him of 1821
or 1822, flushed from his recent triumphs in another arena, and
panting for new conquests in fields yet unexplored. With the unevenness 
and eccentricity which characterised his purely literary work about

<!-- page 6 -->

this period, he sometimes descends to depths as much beneath his
average range as he at other times ascends to heights above it; but we
have no doubt that in the main the work was his.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"MORNING ADVERTISER" <span class="smcap">Oct</span>. 4, 1872.</p>

<p>The machinery, by which the story is worked out is as eccentric as
the aim of the work is vast and ambitious, being no less than to exhibit
the state of Society in Europe and the New World, immediately following 
the establishment of the American Republic, and preceding the
outbreak of the French Revolution.</p>

<p>At the opening we are introduced to one of those old ch&acirc;teaux which
glorified the ancient <i>r&eacute;gime</i> of France in Languedoc, where are assembled,
enjoying the hospitality of its noble owners, the Marquis and Marchioness
de Bagnolles (Huguenots, the Lady being of Scotch parentage and a
Calvinist), a party of noblesse, chief of whom are the Count and
Countess de Ch&acirc;tillon, a "blue" and a strong-minded woman who,
despising love, strongly affects politics; the Baron de Moulin, a Flemish
noble of the "Admirable Chrichton" style, and his niece Emmeline, a
young lady of the "Minerva Press" school of character, consumptive
and sentimental, but for whom alone her brilliant uncle lives.</p>

<p>A Catholic and a Royalist, the Countess somewhat spitefully watches
the doings of her hostess, the Marchioness, who as a Huguenot is given
to the fast-advancing levelling opinions of the time. Her suspicions
being aroused as to a political intrigue, from noticing the fact that the
Marchioness is in the habit of leaving the house nearly every day with a
basket, ostensibly holding flowers, but obviously too large for that
purpose, and which comes back empty, sets a watch, and having, as she
thinks, found the proper clue, orders her weak but good-natured husband
to follow it up. The Count obeys, and finding a cave, descends, when
to his surprise he is clutched by the throat and discovers a dagger at
his breast. The threatening weapon is held by a tall, handsome, but
haggard recluse, who perceiving the Count is unarmed, throws down
his dagger, and strangely enough, at least as far as the art of construction 
is concerned, commences to relate to the Count his history and
adventures. This melodramatic personage is Albert Lunel, the pivot,
character upon which the whole story revolves. His tale is both sad
and long, and so takes many days to tell. The scion of a noble family,
Albert Lunel, although destined to the Bar, becomes, through the means
of a good father Jerome, a Monk. Influenced, however, by the advanced
opinions of the time, his not by any means strong mind soon becomes
shaken as to his fitness for a holy life; but on becoming acquainted with
the beautiful Louise Orange, and a mutual affection springing up
between them, he morbidly meditates upon the unnaturalness of a life
of celibacy, and yet the sinfulness of breaking his vows to "Mother
Church." In this dilemma, a tragic chance comes to his aid. In the
same convent with him is a Father Ambrose, who is handsome, learned,
accomplished, and in Albert's opinion possesses those arts which win
women; but worse than this, the fact that he can at all times gain

<!-- page 7 -->

admittance to her mother's house arouses in our hero the passion of
jealousy. Thus jaundiced, he one evening follows Father Ambrose to
the house of the Countess Orange. Ascending a staircase, which being
under repair has a rope instead of a railing, he hears the voice of Louise
in converse with a man, then the sound of a kiss; believing the man to
be Ambrose, and infuriated by jealousy, he rushes forward, and hurls
him over the rope into the depths below. Upon this incident what
there is of plot hinges, for the man whose neck he has broken proves to
be good Father Jerome, Father Confessor to Louise, who simply kissed
his hand in return for the blessing he had just bestowed upon her. The
good Jerome dying, conscious who was his murderer, gazes upon him in
pity, but speaks nought. So far Albert is safe from justice; for his
crime is known, as he believes, only to Louise, who, by the way, not
only pities but loves him still. But there is a Nemesis at hand, in the
shape of Father Ambrose, who, suspecting the cause of Jerome's death,
extorts the truth under the seal of confession from a dying servant of
Louise Orange, who had witnessed the deed, and this becomes known to
Louise, who now exhorts and aids her lover to escape. Now an outcast,
an outlaw, tortured by conscience, and "fearing in every bush an officer,"
he finds his way, in the disguise of a peasant, to the house of a Huguenot
pastor at Nismes, who receives him warmly. Shortly after, however, a
peasant of Nismes is arrested for the murder of Father Jerome, and is
about to be put to the torture. But Albert Lunel's conscience for
bidding him to permit an innocent man to suffer for his crime, he resolves
to give himself up to justice. This, however, the pastor prevents, by the
connivance of the General-Commandant of the town, who obtains from
the authorities a respite for the accused, and then permits him to escape
from prison. None the less alarmed for Albert's safety, M. Gardein
gives him a letter of introduction to his brother-in-law, M. Girard, also
a Huguenot minister at St. Maurice. At this stage of the work, the
author gives a lengthy chapter, entitled "The Philosophy of a Languedoc
Pastor," which is without doubt one of the finest in the book, exhibiting
as it does, in bold relief, the tone of mind and feelings of the Huguenot
minister, then still suffering from the persecution consequent upon the
revocation of the Edict of Nantes, as also a sketch of the French police
system, which might serve as a satire upon that of our own day and
country. Passing on his way, meeting at every point with some
incident that keeps awake his conscience and alive his terror. Albert
at length reaches M. Girard's house, where, disguised with red whiskers
and green spectacles, he passes as a clergyman! Under this hospitable
roof Albert meets with his first love, Louise Orange. As the latter,
however, being a rigid Roman Catholic, has dismissed him from her
thoughts for his having adopted the reformed religion, the plastic-hearted
Albert transfers his affections to M. Girard's grand-daughter Emilie.
But the poor girl being accidently drowned, he and Louise Orange
become reconciled. A letter from the good Pastor Gardein shortly
afterwards warns him of approaching danger, and advises him to quit
France. Now commences that career of wandering and adventure which
seems the chief object of the author to depict, and which will, perhaps,
more than the preceding portion of the work, stamp it in the minds of
its readers as being from the pen of Lord Brougham.</p>

<p class="center">"LLOYD'S WEEKLY NEWSPAPER."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert Lunel</span>.&mdash;This novel in three volumes, published by Charles
Clarke, Paternoster-row, bears the honoured name of Lord Brougham.
In a note appended to each volume, we read that "Albert Lunel" was
written by the late Lord Brougham in the year 1844, but for private
reasons of his lordship's, was not published. It seems to us that this
note does not sufficiently explain the strange fact, that no mention has
been made by Brougham anywhere, of this work of his; and it is startling 
to see a familiar and an honoured name recalling to us not only the
great statesman, but the steadfast friend&mdash;brought into contact with a
work of which no indication was ever given. The novel is, we need not
say, especially interesting to the reader under the circumstances; and
it is finely written, in the old-fashioned courtly style, dealing with the
polished language, elegant manners, and fashionable vices of the past
century. We cannot pretend to pronounce, if the work be that of
Brougham, but it seems to us that if it be, Brougham was sufficiently
astute to perceive that "Albert Lunel" could not enhance his fame,
and therefore, it was never published in his lifetime: albeit there are
many passages in the work which deserve and attract serious consideration. 
The two or three pages devoted to the delineation of the German
characteristics, are full of observation, and are keen in judgment.</p>

<p>We are afraid, however, that whether "Albert Lunel" be the work
of Brougham or not, its style is too antiquated to please the novel-reading
world of to-day, in which the faults that Brougham (?) touched with all
the delicacy of language at his command, are openly paraded, spades
being called spades in the most unblushing manner.</p>

<p>With these few words, then, we leave the reader to turn to "Albert
Lunel" for himself, if he be prompted. The question of authorship
makes no difference in the quality of the work, and "Albert Lunel" is
replete with wisdom, observation, and humour of a refined and courtly
kind, that is rare in these days, when wit has degenerated into burlesque.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"STANDARD," <span class="smcap">Sept</span>. 12, 1872.</p>

<p>We have here a work written by Henry, First Lord Brougham, in
1844, but then suppressed by its author, although probably printed at
the time, as the type and paper of these volumes appear to testify.
Indeed it would seem to have been written, to judge from the fashion
of the language employed, at a much earlier period, when ejaculatory
phrases, long sentimental dialogues, and a mysterious machinery of
caves and convents were in vogue. Moreover, the chief aims of the
book, so far as it touches on public questions, relate to a time twenty
years prior at least to the date originally intended for the publication
of "Albert Lunel." But the production is none the less curious on
that account. The curtain rises upon the grounds of a ch&acirc;teau in
Languedoc, where before the era of the great convulsion, or rather before
its culminating outburst, the blue blood of France is lazily cultivating
hospitality and &aelig;sthetics. The lady of the ch&acirc;teau has a habit,

<!-- page 9 -->

noticed by one of her <i>noblesse</i> friends, of leaving the house nearly every
day with a basket, ostensibly holding flowers, but obviously too large
for that purpose, which always comes back empty, and sets a watch.
In due season her confidant traces a path; this brings him to a lady's
hair pin on a rock. Following up the clue, he finds a cave, and in the
cave a man of eremital aspect, all beard and blackness, who threatens
with his dagger, but is at last persuaded to recount the adventures of
his career. Then ensues a digression which forms, in interludes, a
principal part of the narrative. This man has killed a holy father, and
has accordingly fled from the world, carrying with him a heavy
conscience and a reproaching load of the dead man's teaching. In
addition, he has, upon his conscience the memory of certain passionate
and jealous struggles, remembered with remorse, which he suffered
before becoming an outlaw. An outlaw he was, however, and we have
some powerful delineations of his fears and agonies&mdash;suspecting himself
to be pursued as a murderer, torn by doubts as to his religious condition,
hunted by the shadow of his crime, and terrified by hearing that an
innocent man had been arrested and was to suffer torture and death for
his deed. The slayer of the father becomes the hermit of the cavern,
after a series of extraordinary incidents on highway and byeway, which
he relates to the lady of the ch&acirc;teau in Languedoc. On his way in
search of solitude he passes a group engaged in executing an assassin,
and reflects that this was the punishment decreed for the crime of which
he himself had been guilty, and he is fascinated so as to stay until the
tragedy is over. Sleeping at a farm-house, he is terrified when a man
looks at him; obtaining work as a stable keeper, he is frightened into
absconding because a servant maid notices the whiteness of his arms;
thus he is induced to abandon these vulgar disguises, put on red whiskers,
and proclaim himself a clergyman. It is in the abode of M. Girard that
he first practises this profession, and M. Girard has a daughter, and M.
Albert has a heart, and the heart and the daughter become inextricably
mingled, what with books, relics, guitars, and musical boxes. It is
difficult to think of the fierce advocate, the turbulent orator, the
unsparing critic, the stern browed Lord Brougham, delighting in these
pastorals of fancy, though this one does not last long, for the young girl
dies, and the hero of the cave is left to quit "the house of mourning"
for "the house of mirth"</p>

<p>Here we see how Lord Brougham can be sensational. He describes
the initiatory rites as practised on a neophyte:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He was now told that the time had come when his virtue must be
tried. He trembled visibly, but answered, 'Lead on!' He was taken,
and we accompanied him, into the next room, more dimly lighted, where
he saw his own brother bound to a stake, with his shirt off, loaded with
irons, and in a posture of supplication. The commands of the invincible
tyrants were then read with a loud voice. He was ordered to put the
victim of stern justice to death, as one who had been treacherous to the
order. 'That the weakness of human nature be spared,' said the president,
rising from his seat, 'your eyes may be bandaged while you perform
your duty according to the obligation of your oath.' He shrunk, and
seemed ready to faint away. He was blind folded; he was led up to the
victim; a dagger was placed in his right hand; he was bid to feel with

<!-- page 10 -->

his left where the heart beat, and so to direct his blow. He convulsively
grasped the dagger, and, with a loud scream, plunged it in. Loud
acclamations rose from all present but me. The bandage was removed
from his eyes. It was found that he had slain a lamb with the wool shorn
and mouth muzzled, and he was covered with the poor creature's blood."</p>

<p>But Louise Orange&mdash;his new ideal&mdash;is not entirely lost; she is
endeavouring to follow in his devious track; he abandons the fraternity
of the dagger, escaping poison while making the attempt; makes a stay
in Holland, where he eulogises the Dutch; takes part in a sea-fight
between that nation and the English, and he starts for America, passing
through a tempest by the way, and landing at New York only to be
horrified by the state of manners he found there existing. We have
shameful scenes in courts of justice, in whipping-houses, in plantations,
in markets, on shipboard, and in private houses; but the interest of
most of this is a bygone, and it is rather to be regretted that the work
is so overladen with it. Indeed, we have little inducement to linger
over these rhetorical invectives. The narrative, after pausing in the
New World, takes a sudden return to France, and the progress of the
Revolution there, and the hero is surprised to find happy valleys and a
free and contented peasantry even in that distracted land. There he
witnesses that which recalls to his mind the image and the voice of the
priest whom he had unwittingly killed. This is the portrait, drawn
from memory:—</p>

<p>"No day ever passed over our head in this happy valley without forcibly
recalling to my memory the conversation of dear Father Jerome, and
sighing, oh how deeply sighing, that he was not here to find so ample a
confirmation of his profound and benevolent doctrines. Among the
numberless amiable, and in my sincere opinion also wise, propensities of
his nature, one was eminent over the rest-the love which he ever felt
for poverty. It always seemed enough to gain his affection that any one
was poor; a poor priest, a poor scholar, a poor householder, a young man
struggling for advancement against adverse circumstances, a widow toiling
to give her child education, a brother labouring to support a sister cast on
his care&mdash;these were cases sure to touch his benevolent heart, to excite his
sympathy, and obtain his help. But he had a speculative as well as a
parental love for those in narrow circumstances, and he conceived that
there was nothing at all to connect poverty with any squalid or coarse
associations. On the contrary, he thought that the indulgences of wealth
were more likely to prepare for the contagion of vice than the exhaustion
of poverty; that luxury, and even comfort, dispensing with work, introducer 
of idleness, minister of the passions, is greatly more a corruptor
than want. However, he would describe how easily, in his view of human
nature, the lot of the peasant and his poverty might be united with not
only the most kindly affections, but with great refinement of mind. The
culture derived from education he conceived to be quite compatible with
a life of hard work, and if it was also a life of hard fare, the risk was
lessened of corruption creeping in to taint its innocence, and debase its
worth by the worst kind of coarseness."</p>

<p>We shall leave to the reader the chapter entitled "The End" because a
powerful interest is created, not withstanding the attraction in the fact
that it was written by Lord Brougham when he was ardent, romantic,
and visionary.</p>

<p class="center">"SPECTATOR," <span class="smcap">Oct</span>. 19, 1872.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has for many years been known that Lord Brougham added a novel
to his long list of writings, in order, as may have been suggested, that
he should verify one-half of the famous sentence in Johnson's epitaph
on Goldsmith. Certainly, if this was the object with which <i>Albert
Lunel</i>,&mdash;from which we quoted years ago a characteristic passage illustrative 
of Brougham's character upon the occasion of his death,&mdash;was
composed, it would enable us to say of his lordship "<i>nullum fere scribendi
genus non tetigit</i>."</p>

<p>The plot of the novel, may be told in a few sentences. A party,
consisting of some French nobles, one or two lawyers, and some travellers,
meets at a ch&acirc;teau in the South of France, and talks the language of
Lord Brougham. One of the party, an intriguing, curious countess,
observes the lady of the house taking frequent walks with a basket of
provisions, and hopes to detect her in something scandalous. With this
view the Countess sets her husband to watch, but all her good intentions 
are frustrated by the Count's discovery that the provisions are
taken to an unfortunate fugitive. This is Albert Lunel, formerly a
Benedictine monk at Avignon, but now hiding from the officers of
justice. Grateful to the Count for his sympathy, Albert Lunel tells the
whole history of his life, beginning with the moment of blind passion
and mistake in which he sacrificed the life of his dearest friend; going
on with his flight from the monastery, his escape into Switzerland, his
stay at G&ouml;ttingen, where he supported himself as a bookseller's hack,
and became member of a secret society, which punished not only treason
to itself, but even lukewarmness, with death; narrating then the
difficulty with which he made his way from Germany to Holland, his
service in an American ship-of-war, and his visits to Charleston, St.
Domingo, and Havana, in all which places he was most impressed by
the horrors of negro slavery; and ending with his return to France, his
meeting with her whom he had loved throughout these wanderings, his
recognition by his enemies, and his escape to his present hiding-place.
While this history is being told to the Count, the people at the ch&acirc;teau
are coming and going, talking and hearing talk; there have been one or two
love affairs, and a fall from a carriage, and now the great Revolution is
at hand. Having completed the autobiography of the fugitive, the
author has only to wind up the other threads of the story, and to
dispose of the various characters. It is not necessary for the reviewer
to follow him in this task.</p>

<p>Older men than the present reviewer will no doubt take great pleasure
in giving the real names to many of the guests at the ch&acirc;teau, and will
explain some of the personal allusions. Without such help, indeed, we
can detect much that is characteristic of Lord Brougham. The dedication 
to Rogers, with the affected humility of its address, and its boast
that the authorship is a mystery which it will be impossible to pierce, is
a fitting introduction to a book which its writer was probably ready to
avow or disavow, as it suited his convenience. Lord Brougham speaks
of himself in the dedication as possessing no name at all, and suggests
that "sagacity may from internal evidence serve to point a conjecture
towards France and her colonies as his country,&mdash;her language as that

<!-- page 12 -->

in which his book may have been written." As the book was written
sometime after Lord Brougham had built his house at Cannes, and a
few years before he submitted his famous request to be enrolled among
the citizens of the Second Republic, this sign of a growing love for
France is perfectly natural. If the allusion in a note to "our Cannings"
and "their shallow wit seems unworthy of one who had defied Canning
as Prime Minister in the House of Commons, the portrait of Lord
Lyndhurst is a manly tribute to the merits of a rival. The name of
M. de Chapeley is a thin disguise for Copley, just as Baron Bayley, the
senior puisne judge in the Exchequer when Lord Lyndhurst was Chief
Baron, can easily be recognised under the style of M. de Balaye. But
the singular fact connected with this introduction of some of Lord
Brougham's former companions is that, in spite of the boasted French
origin of the book, he has imported into France the English system of
judicial appointments. He must have known that French judges are
chosen not from the ranks of the Bar, but from those of the magistracy,
yet he speaks of M. de Chapeley as having been a most skilful and
dexterous advocate, and having been often opposed to M. de Balaye,
when both were at the Bar. It may, however, be worth while quoting
the sketch of Lord Lyndhurst at greater length:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There have been few men more eminent at our Bar; nor would he
discredit the most exalted station in the profession he adorns. His father
was one of our most eminent artists, and the son has, from college upwards,
been always the most distinguished of his contemporaries. At Montpellier
he carried away the highest honours as a profound and elegant mathematician, 
his taste ever keeping pace with his solid substantial acquirements.
In manly vigour of mind, in a sagacity that never fails him, be it applied
to great purposes or to smaller objects, in a happy power of throwing away
the husk of any subject he has to master, and reaching at once the kernel,
he stands unequalled in the law. He was, as an advocate, skilful,
dexterous, learned, ready, undaunted; as a judge, his calm impartiality,
his universal courtesy, his unwearied patience, can only be exceeded by
his unexampled clearness and conciseness of statement, the soundness of
his views, and the cogency of his reasoning. But if in most things he
excels others, in one he seems to exceed himself. I would go any distance
to enjoy again a treat I lately had the relish of, when he displayed to its
utmost perfection his great faculty of clear, connected, interesting narrative, 
without a single remark, or any attempt to apply his facts to his
purpose, yet so completely effecting that purpose by painting to his
auditory a lively picture of the whole case, that the most elaborate
reasoning could not have more perfectly secured the adoption of his
conclusions. They tell me that he, t'other day, equally astonished the
court in which he presides, by a clear and vigourous statement of above
twenty ordinances and edicts, giving the dates and the substance of each,
without omitting even one figure, though without a single note to help his
recollection. They say it was like a code of penal law (for penalties were
the subject), from the edict of Moulins to the present time."</p>

<p>It is not so easy to recognise John Wilson Croker in the character of
M. la Croasse, for though we hear of his polemical writings, and of his
short services in the Naval Administration, he is drawn with such mild
and amiable lines as to efface his real character and suggest that Lord
Brougham wanted to have his novel favourably reviewed in the

<!-- page 13 -->

<i>Quarterly</i>. Time has perhaps blotted out the memory of Sir Andrew
Agnew, the former champion of the Sabbath, yet the picture drawn of
him in this book, where he goes by the name of the Chevalier Andr&eacute;
Agneau, is vivid enough to bring his figure and his habits of mind
before those of a newer generation. We do not profess to have
identified the originals of these portraits without assistance, for the
present writer is not ashamed to own that he was at his first school
when this book was written. But the source from which we have
derived our information is the best of all sources, a volume of Lord
Brougham's letters which has been privately printed by one of his
friends, though it has attained more than a private circulation. As one
of our contemporaries has thrown some doubt on an authorship of which
there is so much internal evidence, it may be right to say that those
letters contain the most explicit avowal. Perhaps to those who are
familiar with Lord Brougham's style and habits, such an admission may
seem superfluous. Yet the world at large will gladly be spared a new
literary controversy, and would prefer tacitly to accept this novel as an
addition to those curiosities catalogued by the elder Disraeli.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"MORNING POST"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert Lunel</span>.&mdash;This novel, written by Lord Brougham so far back as 1844,
but for private reasons withheld from publication, will now be received
with great interest. We are by no means unaccustomed to see our great
statesmen indulge in the pleasures of authorship. Literary occupation
has often proved to them an agreeable relaxation from the toils of
government; nor have they scorned to portray in the pages of romance
some portion of that life of which they have necessarily seen so much.
Still, the reading public will naturally feel a good deal of curiosity as to
the kind of novel which a man like Lord Brougham would produce;
granting that he possessed the necessary literary qualifications for a
work of the kind, it might be expected, considering his immense
opportunities for studying character, to be a work of exceeding interest.
It might be thought that his great legal experience would afford him
examples of men of all kinds, with varying aims and objects, and strange
crooked ways of carrying them out, and that he would have given us a
plot of great intricacy, entangling us in a maze of perplexity, and finally
unfolding in a startling climax. But "Albert Lunel" is a very different
kind of book. Availing himself of his long and frequent residences in
France, and of his knowledge of French life and manners, the author
lays his scenes in a ch&acirc;teau in a southern province, and in the most
straightforward manner tells his story.</p>

<p>A very curious account is given of the initiation of a person into a
secret association called the "Fehmgerichte," a name borrowed from the
ancient secret tribunal of Westphalia. As Lord Brougham expressly
says in his preface that all that relates to manners and customs in his
book is strictly true, we may consider that this society and its ceremonial
has or had a real existence, and that the strangely thrilling murder-drill,
as he calls it, was actually performed. The reader will derive much

<!-- page 14 -->

amusement from the descriptions of the Dutch; so many quaint traits
of character not hitherto brought forward are noticed, their piety,
especially, and its steady-going, calculating nature; no works of
supererogation, godliness being considered practically "a great gain,"
and furnishing a safe per-centage on the capital laid out. But it is
when he comes to America and reads what is said of the slave trade that
he will probably be astonished. So much has been written about the
sensational nature of American anti-slavery books&mdash;and flat contradiction
has been given to the statements in Mrs. Stowe's "Uncle Tom's Cabin"
and "Dred"&mdash;that a large number of persons have been actually induced
to believe that a great deal of sympathy has been wasted, and that half
of the catalogue of horrors has been invented for a purpose. Let them
read the statements of Lord Brougham, who pledges himself for their
"absolute truth" Did ever tales of cruelty more terrible, of ignominy
and debasement more profound, proceed from the pen of the most
"sensational" of writers? No wonder he makes his hero exclaim&mdash;</p>

<p>"This free country! Gracious God! and is this country, where I have
within the last eight-and-forty hours witnessed more scenes of tyranny&mdash;of
cruel, capricious tyranny&mdash;not in one man, but pervading the whole
community;&mdash;this country, where half its human inhabitants are groaning,
smarting, wailing in a state of bondage more bitter than any which the
far-famed despots of the East can bind their subjects;&mdash;this country, in
which the labouring classes are all, without one exception, held, not
metaphorically but actually, in chains and fetters, scourged, tortured,
murdered, treated like cattle, and worse than any cattle are treated, only
suffered to have the feelings of men that their pride may be insulted, their
affections outraged, their hearts torn by every torment that a sentient
nature can endure;&mdash;is this country to be called free, to boast of its liberty
and its inhabitants, even to look down upon the rest of mankind as
enslaved and enthralled compared with themselves."</p>

<p class="center">"PALL MALL GAZETTE."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">"Albert Lunel,"</span> is interesting chiefly as another testimony to the
versatility of the late Lord Brougham. "Grammaticus, rhetor,
geometres, omnia novit." At eighteen he gave to the world an abstruse
mathematical treatise; at sixty-six he wrote "Albert Lunel" a like
inversion, apparently, of the natural order of authorship to that which
Macaulay notices as singular in the cases of Bacon and Burke, whose
later style, compared with the severity of their earlier, was florid and
fanciful. "Albert Lunel" however, is not to be regarded as a mere
work of the imagination. The declaration of its title-page, that private
reasons prevented its author from publishing it, and its mysteriously
worded dedication, suggest that all its lifelike characters are drawn
direct from life. As the book owes its interest to its authorship, we
shall quote at length this curious characteristic dedication to Samuel
Rogers:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is natural that the countenance of a great name, the certainty of
obtaining an enlightened reader, the benefit of having a candid, though
severe critic, should be sought by one who has no name at all, and only

<!-- page 15 -->

desires justice and intelligence in his judge. These attributes the writer
of this work found united in you, and to you he has taken the liberty of
inscribing it. Should such an accident ever happen as your indulging in
any curiosity upon the matter, you will find the mystery in which your
unknown admirer is wrapped impossible to pierce. Your sagacity may, from
internal evidence, serve to point a conjecture towards France and her
colonies, as his country&mdash;her language as that in which his book may have
been written. But upon one subject, no doubt must be allowed to rest.
In all that relates to political events and political characters: to the
manners, the genius, the conduct of nations; above all, to the state of
society beyond the Atlantic, there is no fiction, no colouring whatever,
any more than in the sacred doctrines most connected with human happiness&mdash;peace 
and freedom, religion, rational as well as puro morality,
uncompromising thought, charitable benevolence, universal but discriminating&mdash;which 
it is the design of these pages to teach.</p>

<p>Albert Lunel was destined by his father for the bar, but under the
influence of a youthful fascination with the character and mode of life
of Father Jerome, a Benedictine Friar, he preferred to don the priest's
cassock rather than the lawyer's gown. No sooner, however, had he
taken the irretrievable step under the fascination of friendship than
he was seduced into repenting it under the more overpowering fascination 
of love. The young lady who made so deep an impression on him
was visited at once by three holy fathers&mdash;Albert, Ambrose, and Jerome&mdash;of
whom Father Jerome alone was stoic enough to remain true, even in
thought, to his vows, in the presence of so much wit, wisdom, and
loveliness. Thus a long-standing feud between the hero and Father
Ambrose was embittered by jealousy; and in a blind paroxysm of this
passion Father Albert kills Father Jerome by mistake for his rival. He
is forced to fly into Switzerland to the house of a Protestant pastor, who
finds it an easy task to complete the work of his conversion from
Romanism which love had already begun, but who is unable to conceal
or protect him from the keen pursuit of Rome. From it he flies to
G&ouml;ttingen, to fall into still more deadly peril, and to make a still more
narrow escape into Holland from the vengeance of a secret society, whose
laws he had transgressed. He quits Holland to serve on board an
American ship of war, disembarks at Charlestown, makes his way to
Philadelphia, and then to St. Domingo and Havana, to give the author
an opportunity of delivering himself strongly on his favourite topic of
slavery, and from thence sails for France to find a precarious refuge from
the unrelaxed pursuit of Rome in the cavern in which we are first
introduced to him. From this harassed life he is relieved by the
protection of a powerful brother, whose suicide shortly after leaves him
heir to his position and property, and free to unite himself at last to
"the cause of all his guilt and all his joy" to quote, not inappropriately,
the epistle of Heloise to Abelard. Such in meagre outline is the story
of Albert Lunel. Such a plot offers many excellent opportunities for
the display of skill, either in the delineation of a character distracted by
two of the most over-mastering of human motives, or in the description
of a career crowded with stirring incidents and striking situations. We
learn from a contemporary that a volume of Lord Brougham's letters,
printed for private circulation, supplies a key to the English originals of
the visitors at the Ch&acirc;teau&mdash;that M. de Chapeley is Lord Lyndhurst,

<!-- page 16 -->

M. de Balaye is Baron Bayley, M. la Croasse is John Wilson Croker, and
that the Chevalier Andr&eacute; Agneau is Sir Andrew Agnew, the fanatic
Sabbatarian. Of Wilson Croker, his old rival in journalism, he speaks
with an enthusiasm that would have astonished the editor of the
<i>Eatanswill Gazette</i>, as&mdash;</p>

<p>"One of the most distinguished men of the day&mdash;a man of extraordinary
talents, great information, and an active mind; a fearless assertor of his
principles, and one who, to further those principles, was capable of making
great sacrifices. Like all men of great talents and success in life, he had
his enemies, who pelted him incessantly, sometimes with paper pellets in
the daily press, sometimes with leaden pellets in their books; to which he
seemed sufficiently indifferent. He was of perfectly good breeding, and
could listen as well as talk, and was always sure to contribute something
valuable, either in wit, in argument, or in narrative."</p>
