<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is natural that the countenance of a great name, the
certainty of obtaining an enlightened reader, the benefit
of having a candid though severe critic, should be sought
by one who has no name at all, and only desires justice
and intelligence in his judge. These attributes the
writer of this work found united in you, and to you he
has taken the liberty of inscribing it.</p>

<p>Should such an accident ever happen as your indulging
in any curiosity upon so trifling a matter, you
will find the mystery in which your unknown admirer
is wrapped impossible to pierce. Your sagacity may,
from internal evidence, serve to point a conjecture
towards France and her colonies, as his country,&mdash;her
language, as that in which his book may have been
written.</p>

<p>But upon one subject, no doubt must be allowed to
rest. In all that relates to political events, and political
characters; to the manners, the genius, the conduct

<!-- vol 1 page vi -->

of nations; above all, to the state of society beyond
the Atlantic; there is no fiction, no colouring whatever,
any more than in the sacred doctrines most connected
with human happiness&mdash;peace and freedom&mdash;religion,
rational as well as pure&mdash;morality, uncompromising
though charitable&mdash;benevolence, universal, but discriminating&mdash;which
it is the design of these pages to
teach.</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="small">THE BEGINNING.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was one of those truly delicious evenings of which
untravelled Englishmen know scarcely five or six
throughout the summer, but which in Southern
France are frequent, indeed almost constant, during
half the year. The sultry heats of midsummer and
early autumn, extending into the night, scarcely
leave its relish to that sweet season, and the exhaustion
of the day hardly permits a desire for any
exercise; but as August fades away, the air becomes
more temperate, and nothing can be figured more
truly delightful than those evenings which succeed
the latest heats of the declining sun. A lively
pleasure is felt in mere existence; the air is balmy;

<!-- vol 1 page 2 -->

if any breeze moves it, there is refreshment conveyed
on its wing; the lightsome feeling which is
diffused cannot be described to those who have
never known it; there is as much enjoyment as
can be tasted without any excitement, and the
languor which succeeds to more boisterous and
short-lived pleasures, and is itself of brief duration,
now becomes the habitual feeling and the pure
solace of hours. An Englishman never fails to be
deeply struck with these delights of climate; he
finds within him unwonted emotions; his senses
are stirred with new enjoyments; and he comprehends
the Italian's meaning when, against all the
joys of active exertion, congenial to our ungenial
sky, he sets with an unhesitating preference the
sweets of his idol Far Niente, sometimes extolled as
<i>dolce</i>, and sometimes exalted to a higher rank by
the prefix of <i>santo</i>, or even <i>sacro-santo</i>.</p>

<p>As we proceed further southward, the grove is
filled with the sweet perfumes of those regions;
each breeze wafts a scent to rouse the jaded senses,
or to excite some feeling that may break the languor
diffused over them, by providing some new sensation.
The corruscations of the sky become more
vivid and unremitting, and while the glow-worm's

<!-- vol 1 page 3 -->

lamp is hung out to allure her volatile love, and fix
him for a while in her stationary bower, the fire-fly
sparkles from bush to bush of the shrubbery, giving
a lively but a mild illumination, that animates the
scene without breaking its stillness or disturbing its
repose. There wants, indeed, in those delightful
regions only one charm; "Morn ascends not with
the charm of earliest birds," and "Her solemn bird
attends not silent night." The grove is perfumed;
it is not vocal.</p>

<p>These evenings are the seasons of our existence,
when, the soul, free from the interruptions of the
senses, at least in their stormy mood, unprovoked
by the stimulus of pleasure, nor vexed by the stings
of pain, in calm and serene possession of itself,
naturally falls into contemplations removed from
earthly influence; expatiates over the prospect of
human affairs, if informed for such views, or, at
least, ponders upon its own past existence, its future
lot; and rises oftentimes above all merely human
scenes to speculate upon its fate in another state of
being. The devout Catholic in those moments of
repose, like the Brahmin under the shade of his
Areka tree, is absorbed in heavenly contemplation,
ruffled sometimes by passing doubts, but far more

<!-- vol 1 page 4 -->

commonly indulging those ecstatic visions of unbounded
and unceasing bliss, which his infallible
Church has declared to her believing sons, and has
in tender compassion to human infirmity, as well as
in skilful regard to her hopes of human adhesion,
annexed to the easy performance of duties within
the reach of the least rigid virtue, and calling for
the most moderate exercise of self-denial.</p>

<p>This climate and these nights are enjoyed by the
people of Languedoc in a greater degree than their
Proven&ccedil;al neighbours know; because there is not
the same parching drought which forms the curse
of the South, especially beyond the Alpine ridge,
and because there is a far more exuberant foliage,
and everywhere an ampler vegetation than is to be
found in the rocky, arid, though shrubby, region of
the "Sweet-scented Mendicant."<sup id="r001"><a href="#n001">1</a></sup></p>

<p>On such an evening as we have faintly described,
and about the hour of sunset, arrived in the extensive
grounds of the Marquess de Bagnolles, a travelling
carriage, with a gentleman and a single servant,
who leaving his master at the gate proceeded to deliver

<!-- vol 1 page 5 -->

a letter to the Marquess. The consequence was
an immediate invitation to the Ch&acirc;teau; where a
party was assembled, and had just taken their coffee
after dinner. The stranger advanced, courteously
but somewhat shyly, if not proudly, and made his
obeisance to the circle with some excuse for intruding
at so late an hour, but ascribing this to the
illness of his niece, whom he had left at the village
cabaret, and for whom he was anxious to obtain the
hospitality of the Ch&acirc;teau, as they found it wholly
impossible to continue their journey. A servant was
immediately dispatched, and the young lady was
soon safely placed in a suitable apartment, where
the quiet which her ailment required could be
secured. The travellers had been enjoying their
visit at Nismes, exploring the rich remains of
Roman architecture in which it abounds more than
any place out of Rome, feasting their eyes upon the
exquisite beauties of the Maison Carr&eacute;e, which transports
the imagination back to the Augustan age, by
its entire preservation and appearance of a temple in
actual use, and then gazing with increased wonder
on the magnificence of the Pont du Gard, contrasted
with its romantic environs, a magnificence to which
even the Eternal City itself has nothing at all

<!-- vol 1 page 6 -->

superior, if indeed, it have any thing equal. The
fatigues of this day with its excitements had, the
Baron de Moulin said, proved too great for the
feeble health of Emmeline, and he desired leave to
retire and visit her in order to relieve the anxiety her
illness had occasioned him.</p>

<p>Upon his withdrawing, the Marquess mentioned
that the new guest of the ch&acirc;teau was well known
to him by reputation, as a person of extraordinary
faculties and great attainments, though of a character
somewhat lofty and ungracious, yet one destined
for great things, should the ferment continue
which now existed in the nation by the state of
public affairs; for though residing in Flanders, where
his property lay, and where he had held high office,
his family was French. "I am too young," said
he, "to have any pretension to share in these things,
and my father's premature death has called me to
the discharge of private duties, that must for some
time exclude me from public affairs. But the
Baron, whose mature years and great capacity point
him out to the friends of improvement as their
powerful and natural leader, has only to struggle
against the obstacles interposed by the weight of
years; for the letter he brings me says, he is long

<!-- vol 1 page 7 -->

past his prime, although his marvellous vigour both
of body and mind appear to gather new strength,
and impart to all his actions new life. He has all
his days been the most active of men, insomuch that
it used to be a joke on him ever since he left the
University of Montpellier that he slept with one eye
ever open, and could write with both hands at the
same time. Had he only your age" (continued the
Marquess, addressing himself to M. de Chatillon),
"he might reach the utmost heights of our state,
should any of the storms that now threaten France
unsettle the form of our ancient Monarchy."&mdash;"Alas,
Marquess," said M. de Chatillon, "how far better
would it be for us all that such spirits as you
describe the Baron should pass through life like
our forefathers, occupied with the care of their
peasantry, or the improvement of their estates, and
only seeking to excel in the tranquil walks of
literature, or shine in the harmless splendour of
courts!"</p>

<p>The Baron now returned to join the party in
their walk upon the terrace, and he returned with
a countenance that showed how much he had been
relieved by finding his young charge greatly recovered
and fallen into a sweet sleep, the refreshment

<!-- vol 1 page 8 -->

of which he expected would enable her to
appear next morning.</p>

<p>They walked along a spacious lawn, which constant
care and watering enabled the Marchioness to
maintain in a somewhat green state, unless in the
most burnt-up season of the year, but which the
earlier rains of autumn had refreshed and really
made somewhat like grass, if it could not be called
turf. It was closed at one extremity by a pavilion
in which were groups of marble figures by good
artists, and one by Canova of the Graces, with a
fountain that played in the centre of the vestibule.
Through the pavilion you entered the flower-garden,
which was extensive and rich and various.
The other extremity of the terrace lost itself in a
shrubbery, which ended in a woody walk, that
wound along the side of an eminence near the
Ch&acirc;teau, and conducted the party to a path of
natural gravel on the margin of a small lake, whose
deep blue water now reflected the last rays of the
setting sun. Nothing could be imagined more truly
delicious than this walk. Its course along the lake
under the thick shade of the trees was both beautiful
and refreshing; and from its extremity there
led several footpaths through the deepest recesses of

<!-- vol 1 page 9 -->

the wood. When you followed these, you came
into a perfect wilderness, without the least vestige
of culture or care. Tangled thickets on every side
almost impeded your progress; the underwood was
dense, filling up the space between the trees; the
ground indeed was carpeted with odoriferous plants
of every kind, which in this delicious climate abundantly
yield their perfumes to each passing breeze.
But wildness was the prevailing character of the
scene, and you plainly perceived that you were,
indeed, in a desert wilderness, where nothing reminded
you of human cares or even human existence.
All at once, after labouring through the
thicket, you broke upon a flower-garden of small
extent, but of exquisite beauty, whose complete
culture was visible in every plant, flower, stem, and
group. A fountain played in the centre, and a rustic
bower afforded a seat on one side. The effects of
the contrast were remarkable; and the pleasure It
yielded was the reverse of that which they feel who
visit in Holland the thick wood of the Hague, the
only piece of natural scenery in that country of
artificial existence, alike for vegetable and for animal
nature.</p>

<p>In these grounds the company wandered to enjoy

<!-- vol 1 page 10 -->

the twilight, and the heat being still too little
abated to allow much walking, they sat down in
one of the arbours reared near the lake; when a
small choir of singers, part of the company that
had gone round by another route, struck up the
national air of Henri Quatre; and then recited
some of the fine Troubadour Songs so intimately
associated with all recollections of Languedoc and
Provence.</p>

<p>The evening passed in the enjoyment of these delightful
scenes; in reading and in games, rather of
skill than chance, as chess; for the family of the Marquess
was of strict Huguenot principles, like so many
of those in that part of France, and the Marchioness
was of the most rigid Calvinistic faith, her family
having traced its descent from the old Covenanters
of Scotland. The Baron felt this some kind of
restraint; for he sincerely respected the religious
feelings of others, how much soever he differed with
them, and was always delicately apprehensive of
giving them pain, by any of the levities into which
his wit or humour might naturally betray him, and
above all, by any appearance of making their puritanism
a subject of his ridicule; but the early hour
at which all retired to rest soon relieved him, and

<!-- vol 1 page 11 -->

he promised himself the greatest pleasure he could
taste, in the restoration of his niece to society after
the refreshment of a night's rest.</p>

<p>The breakfast next morning, according to the custom
of the Marchioness (whose family was English)
preserved our social fashion so much approved by
Madame de Sta&euml;l. After this pleasant and lively
meal, where all are fresh and gay, and all are full
of the morning's projects, or the day's occupation,
the family circle had scarcely been formed in the
drawing-room, when a slender and graceful figure
was seen to rise and salute the Marchioness in her
mother-tongue, with a peculiar sweetness of voice,
and a manner modest even to timidity. Her complexion
wore not the hue of health; but it added to
the charm of her most delicate features, and her
eyes at once shone with tenderness and spirit. Her
form, though slight, was admirable, and without
the traits of regular beauty, the whole effect of her
face, figure, air, and expression had something far
more attractive than mere loveliness of shape and
colour can bestow. The rapture of the Baron's eyes
when he presented her to his new friends, at once
showed that this was his Emmeline, then in her
eighteenth year: the cherished object of all his cares;

<!-- vol 1 page 12 -->

the only child of a brother with whom he had grown
up from childhood in the most undivided intimacy,
and whose true affection, whose sage counsels had
guided, whose manly spirit had supported him
through all his trials, and whose death had inflicted
upon him the only great sorrow he had ever known.
Since the loss of her father, while yet a child, her
mother having died in giving her birth, she had centered
all her affections in her uncle, whom indeed
she regarded as if she had never known a parent;
nor was he more wrapped up in her than she in him.
The Marchioness seeing her embarrassed by the entrance
of so many strangers from the breakfast parlour,
asked if she would accompany her to sit awhile
in the Orangery, to which she gently answered,
"Please," and with the Baron they retired. She of
course became the subject of conversation. "One
plainly perceives," said the Countess de Chatillon,
"that this tender creature is not the Baron's immediate
descendant. His hard metal would not easily
cut into so soft a trinket."&mdash;"And why," asked
the Marquess, "should not his solid gold be beaten
into a leaf so light that a breath might move it?"&mdash;"Rather,"
rejoined the Countess, "take your comparison
from the iron ribbons into which we saw that

<!-- vol 1 page 13 -->

powerful and intractable metal fashioned the other
day at St. Etienne."<sup id="r002"><a href="#n002">2</a></sup></p>

<p>"However," said the Count de Chatillon, "I think
you will admit that Mdlle. Emmeline is a very attractive
person in all that we can see of her appearance
and her manner, which alone we as yet know; and I
am told by her uncle that she is extremely clever and
well-informed."&mdash;"Aye, indeed, my good lord," said
his gifted spouse, "I doubt not he gives his wares
a good character as he brings them to market;
but were I a man, I should prefer a less tender helpmate."&mdash;"My
darling," said her husband, "you
are eternally speculating on people's designs about
their daughters; when from all I can perceive of
the Baron, and indeed from all I have ever heard of
him, my belief is that nothing enters less into his
head than any such event as you are dreaming of,
and that to lose his niece in that way would give him
the greatest concern."</p>

<p>"May be so," said his inexorable partner, "may
be so. Did you just observe how tenderly this young
exquisite drawled out her '<i>Please</i>' when the Marchioness
offered her a seat in the Orangery?"&mdash;"My

<!-- vol 1 page 14 -->

love," said the Count, "you are a very clever and
a very clear-seeing person, and God knows how very
clever and clear-sighted you may be without being
quite as infallible as you conceive yourself; but anything
more unlike one of your exquisites, those compounds,
or rather, let me say, those composts of
affectations, selfishness, and false sentiment, I never
did see than Mdlle. de Moulin; and as for her
'please,' which offends you so much, I could not
hear it without being convinced that it was merely
her giving thanks to unburthen her mind of gratitude,
without putting the other party to the trouble of
receiving them."&mdash;"Charming! sentimental! truly
becoming a young innocent girl, or a professional
poet! But from <i>you</i> whose tastes and habits we all
know"&mdash;"Come, Countess," said the host, willing
to break off a dialogue which plainly annoyed
the husband, and did not cover the wife with any
glory save that of ability and eloquence&mdash;"Come,
let us have a drive through the Forest ride before
the great heat begins." The Countess felt this
rebuke, how delicately soever administered, and the
anger, which her husband's less polished weapon
had inflicted, was exasperated to something bordering
upon fury by the keen cutting of the Marquess's

<!-- vol 1 page 15 -->

oil-dipped razor; but it was a suppressed fury; and
the consequences were startling to each beholder.
The fine colour of her face had given place to a
harsh paleness that covered as with a shroud each
feature; her eye was not so much animated with rage
as glazed in her head; the expression of her beautiful
countenance had become hard rather than fierce;
while in her throat there seemed some obstruction,
as if a portion of it were swollen by something
she could not swallow. The lips from vermilion
became pale and were compressed within the
narrowest dimensions, betokening a strong effort of
restraint under which she was endeavouring to lay
herself. This appearance, altogether the most repulsive
that can well be imagined, only lasted a few
moments. By a continuance of the same effort
she, who without any effort so often conquered
others, had now subdued herself; she regained her
noble look and wonted self-possession; nor could
any one entering the room at that moment have
supposed that a scene had preceded his coming.
But, also, no one who had witnessed that scene
could easily forget it; all felt it alike; and each
said to himself, "What would this have burst out
in, had she been alone with either the Marquess, or

<!-- vol 1 page 16 -->

the Count, or even the Baron, whom she now saw
for the first time?" Nor could any one who had
witnessed this scene ever fail to recall it to recollection,
as often as he afterwards felt the power of her
incomparable beauty, extraordinary talents, and
commanding position in society.</p>

<p>While these things were passing in the saloon,
Emmeline, with her uncle, was quietly reposing in
the Orangery, where the Marchioness had left them
to make her morning visit to the children's school-room,
and to exercise them in religious offices. The
heavenly weather, and the relief from her yesterday's
illness, which she now enjoyed, made her give
loose to those pious feelings, which, interwoven with
her gentle and affectionate nature, made her whole
existence one continued thanksgiving and prayer;
and she could not retain any emotion of her heart
from her second parent. "How gracious, dearest
Zio<sup id="r003"><a href="#n003">3</a></sup> (so she always called him), are all the dispensations
of our bountiful Father in heaven! Seldom
he visits us with pain, and if he does, how surely
does he make the compensation which I am now
enjoying, in giving to our state of mind and of body

<!-- vol 1 page 17 -->

on emerging from sickness a sweet zest unknown to
those who have never suffered. I would cheerfully
undergo all I yesterday felt to purchase the relish
of returning health I now enjoy." The Baron
clasped to his bosom this dear charge, "My
blessed child," he said, "I pray it may not be your
lot often to exercise your faith and your piety by such
devout thankfulness; yet His will be done who
disposes all for our good!" As she earnestly whispered
"Amen," he felt what had so often tried his
faith and exercised his piety, the awful doubts which
are engendered in the mind by the touching spectacle
of patient virtue suffering always and never
repining, while the children of vice, or the votaries
of folly, so often revel in their indulgence without
any pain, as without any stint, and complain of the
order of nature, should but a rose-leaf be ruffled on
their couch.</p>

<p>When they returned to the drawing-room, Emmeline
was soon placed by her uncle near the Marchioness,
who entered into conversation with her,
on the beauties of Nismes, and the wonders of the
Pont du Gard; while the Countess engaged the
Baron in a lively talk. Scenery she could not endure
to hear mentioned, far less discussed. Her

<!-- vol 1 page 18 -->

proper study was man; and as her understanding
was wholly masculine, her tastes were somewhat
guided if not formed by it. She disregarded most
topics of female interest; was not much satisfied
with the talk which well-bred men even of intelligence
and information addressed to women of her
rank; cared somewhat more for homage done to
her matchless beauty, the female stratum here fusing
by the central heat and breaking through the harder
crust above; but chiefly she delighted in either attack
or defence of distinguished personages, or in examinations
of literary merit, or above all in political
discussion. The fame of the Baron, both as a savant
and a statesman, had preceded him; she cared
little for the repulsive plainness of his exterior, and
his somewhat brusque though sufficiently high-bred
manners; and she at once gave herself up to discover,
as she told the Count, "what he really was
made of."</p>

<p>For his part he was instantaneously attracted by
her numberless charms, so fitted to fascinate one
like him, because her features were instinct with expression,
reflecting the spirit within that supported
the exterior, diffused itself through each part, inspired
the mass, and mingled itself with the ample

<!-- vol 1 page 19 -->

but graceful person. Little cared he for her proverbial
coldness, so he might hope to thaw it by assiduous
efforts; or even for her hardness, ill suited
to harmonize with such truly feminine charms, so he
might aspire to soften it, and reduce it within what
he deemed the limits of her proper gender.</p>

<p>Thus prepared, these distinguished parties now
first met in the single combat of society; for few
besides themselves cared to bear a part in the
conversation.</p>

<p>"What opinion, may I ask, has M. le Baron
formed of the expected meeting of the States at
Grenoble?"<sup id="r004"><a href="#n004">4</a></sup></p>

<p>"Truth to tell, I have not as yet made up my
mind, nor have I indeed had time to examine the
grounds of the hopes and the fears I find entertained
and extending far beyond Dauphin&eacute;. I met M.
Courdemont at Nismes, and heard him say his
say."</p>

<p>"Oh then tell us what he told you."</p>

<p>"Really," rejoined the Baron, "he is a person
with all his abilities and acquirements but little
suited to my taste, and who don't inspire much confidence,

<!-- vol 1 page 20 -->

either in his facts or in his views; at least
no confidence that bears any proportion to that
which he himself reposes in both."</p>

<p>"Aye, truly," said the Count, "I hold him
to be but a light material."</p>

<p>"Except as regards his pleasantry," said
the Countess; "that you'll allow is no light
matter."</p>

<p>"Nor any laughing matter either;" said the
Count. "He is, however, a well-meaning, as he
is a well-read man, full half eaten up with self-sufficiency.
But he is after all not much disliked,
except by those who hate bores; and he is,
generally speaking, on good terms with everybody
he knows."</p>

<p>"Including himself," said the Baron drily,
"whom he does not much know, and with whom
he seems in no particular haste to improve his acquaintance.
He has, indeed, a most undivided and
even exclusive good opinion of himself&mdash;for he has
it much to himself; few share it with him."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes,"&mdash;said the Marquess, "he is at the head
of a small knot of admirers, all of whom have a
share in the opinion of him; like a joint-stock company
formed to manage a patent for exclusive sale

<!-- vol 1 page 21 -->

of an invention, the inventor and patentee himself
being at the head of it."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," said the Baron, "he is a man
of shining abilities, much book-learning, so profound
a mathematician as to have passed all his contemporaries
at Montpellier, of as profound a knowledge
of the law as ignorance of the world, extraordinary
powers of conversation&mdash;eloquent in a
high degree&mdash;fluent in the highest."</p>

<p>"God knows that he is," quoth the Countess;
"I have groaned under his fluency; not indeed of
conversation, of which he is incapable, but of talk.
I do assure you I last Sunday suffered under him
at Nismes, where I met him at dinner; and it is
a far greater evil than the ordinary inflictions of
society."</p>

<p>"What, dear," said the Count, "did he cut you
out; leave you no niche in the talk?"</p>

<p>"Chatillon," said she sharply, "your pleasantry
is ill placed. I am not apt to engross conversation,
nor to grumble when deprived of my share; I can
generally take it when I please; or if not, I can
listen as well as most people to most people. But
to the Sieur Courdemont I positively cannot. It
is one eternal, unceasing, unbroken babble, wholly

<!-- vol 1 page 22 -->

without relief; a constant glare without any shade,
a perpetual flash, or endless prosing, a stream of
words that chokes you or makes you nervous. I
protest that I could not recollect any one thing he
said, after having been exposed to his talk for two
hours by the clock; from the egg to the apple,<sup id="r005"><a href="#n005">5</a></sup>
which, as he with infinite prolixity and self-approbation
expounded to a young lady ignorant of
Latin, meant from the beginning to the end of
dinner&mdash;So, you see, I have really contrived to retain
one thing he said. But, oh heavens! how
much besides of this ceaseless and stintless chatter
passed through both ears without in any way reaching
the mind, or at least the memory!&mdash;I declare
I never again, while I live, will run the risk of a
like penance."</p>

<p>"I find people," said the Count, "require express
notice to be given when he dines any where,
and that some, like skilful generals, make it a rule
to keep their carriages waiting until dinner is
announced in order to secure their retreat, should
they find he has effected a lodgment."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 23 -->

<p>"How strange it is," said the Marquess, "that
mere faults of exuberance should be so fatal!
Could he not cut himself down to the dimensions
of an ordinary talker? The parings would set up
half a dozen men endued with some sense, taste,
and breeding."</p>

<p>"No, no," said the Baron: "were any one to
tell him all this, he would turn a deaf ear; not
indeed more deaf than he now does to all that
every one says but himself. He has too long
spoken to the little circle of admirers, the directors
of the joint-stock company you spoke of, to bear the
hard-hearted, hard-headed, indifferent public. His
ear has been far too long tickled with the sweet music
of his own voice, to bear being told how it grates on
all the ears on other heads, and gives with his
volubility a pain or at least an uneasiness in the
stomach to his unhappy audience."</p>

<p>"Like a concert of drummers learning their
trade," said the Countess. "But at least, Baron,
you may recount something of his Grenoble intelligence."</p>

<p>"Alas, Madam, he was far too much in love
with his own theories and historical recollections to
tell me anything I could repeat. He pinned me

<!-- vol 1 page 24 -->

by the button for half an hour, while he treated me
to a review of the assemblies, States General,
Provincial States, and Parliaments. I believe he
began with Charlemagne, if not with Clovis, and I
only escaped towards the reign of Louis XIII. by
the stratagem of a fainting fit, whereupon he pursued
me to the Hotel, and when I was forced to
revive he was prelecting to Madame Faure, the
mistress of the house, and the head-waiter Corvon,
upon the circulation of the blood, and organic
diseases of the heart. They both kindly prescribed
repose, in the hope that I might defer my journey
a day or two, and take an apartment. So my
tormentor went off in a kind of round trot, half
walk, half run, speaking to himself with much
vehemence, an auditory of whose attention and
admiration he can always make sure; I understand
he was taken for Janon the cobbler, by Madame de
la Roche, who met him, and asked where his shop
was, as she wanted to have her half-boot mended.
Be that as it may, I escaped, and soon after we left
Nismes."</p>

<p>"I perceive plainly enough," said the Countess,
"that your taste does not much differ from mine
in regard to the Prince of Bores; and he often

<!-- vol 1 page 25 -->

reminds me of the Bishop of Autun's<sup id="r006"><a href="#n006">6</a></sup> saying, as I
have heard it repeated, that to reach eminence in
that dismal art, the black art of boring, a person
must have something in him&mdash;persons merely null
cannot attain it."</p>

<p>"Why, I really must say," replied the Baron,
"with all my respect for so high an authority, so
great a judge's opinion, I somewhat hesitate on the
point. One sees accomplished practitioners go on
with marvellous little capital, with very little if
anything in them."</p>

<p>"Yet try to recollect," said she, "and I think
you will find not one of those whom you have
dreaded as Bores, but had some talent beside that of
wearying you to death. It seems as if the instrument
required some sharpness as well as strength to penetrate
and perform its office. It may be that we
shake off the feebler species of the animal more
easily, while the stronger can lodge and fix themselves
like the forest-flies, that drive our cattle mad.
People vary, like the cattle, in the degree to which
they feel the infliction."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Baron, "I am unfortunate in

<!-- vol 1 page 26 -->

this respect; I am extremely sensitive to the Bore as
I am to the musquito; easily catch the malady it
gives; and sigh for a Bore-net, a para-bore, to protect
me, like our musquito-curtains&mdash;I believe I am
the natural prey of the Bore."</p>

<p>"Not so much. Baron," said the Marchioness,
"as an old gentleman from India, whom I knew in
England, and who had brought back the heats of
Bengal to make his nature, if possible, more warm
and impatient than it originally was. Once he was
under the operation of an artist in this branch, whom
he could not in any way brush off, being pinned up
in a corner: and the good easy man was going on
descanting, like M. Courdemont, with infinite self-applause,
and laying down propositions on all his
five figures, in the pleasing belief that the old Nabob's
twitches and shrugs were the result of the
intense interest he took in the lecture. All of a
sudden, the patient"&mdash;</p>

<p>"If one may so call him," said the Baron.</p>

<p>"Well, the impatient, if you so please, broke out,
and collared the talker, exclaiming, with an oath,
'There's no bearing this one moment longer!'
and thus escaped. The bystanders describe the
face of the astonished performer as beyond the

<!-- vol 1 page 27 -->

power of conception to any that had not witnessed
it."</p>

<p>"I was once circumvented," said the Baron, "by
Courdemont, whom I had innocently suffered to get
me into a corner, the constant and as it were instinctive
stratagem of the species; and my friends,
hearing I was in durance, were busy planning means
for the relief of the garrison, or to raise the siege.
One proposed a ladder applied to the window, by
which I might march out; another the cry of fire;
but they ended in the simple expedient of a flag of
truce&mdash;a letter by a courier&mdash;so I made my escape
for that time."</p>

<p>"But, after all," said the Countess, "I can learn
nothing of what most interests me,&mdash;Grenoble!"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Love," said the Count, taking his fair partner
into the library, "you let politics run between you
and your wits."</p>

<p>"Chatillon," said she, "I have often told you
not to interfere with my tastes, as I don't interfere
with yours."</p>

<p>"It is entirely for your own sake I speak, and
to make you more perfectly amiable than you will
allow yourself to be, with every advantage from
figure and position that woman can possess."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 28 -->

<p>"Spare your kind pains," she answered, with a
look of no very mild description, "and let me try,
what, I grant you, may prove impossible, to raise
<i>you</i> into something more worthy of <i>your</i> position,
and make you more respectable than you are
pleased to make yourself, with every advantage of
station that man can possess."</p>

<p>"Why, dearest," said he, "what would you
have me do?"</p>

<p>"Almost anything you don't now do! Why not
go to Grenoble and take your seat among the
state deputies about to assemble? I wish to go
there without delay; instead of lingering here, to
vegetate, and kill time and patience together. I
would be near the scene of action. Something must
come of this ferment; and let us be on the spot to
look after our own interest. I plainly perceive that
the Baron expects it to increase and to spread, for
all he turned me aside to discuss Courdemont and
Boring."</p>

<p>It would not be easy to express the effect which
this whole conversation produced on the mind of
Emmeline, who heard all of it but the last part in
the library. She never before had seen a female
politician, nor had witnessed the effects of a passion

<!-- vol 1 page 29 -->

not natural to the person or the sex over whom
its ravages sweep. With all the Countess's great
beauty, all her talents, and all her information,
Emmeline felt so much shocked at the unamiable
harshness which the indulgence of humours and
tastes little suited to a young woman diffused over
her manner and even her appearance, that she gently
whispered the Baron, "Dearest Zio, I had far
rather look as silly and empty as my maid Susette,
who is good-humoured, than shine in repartee, or
deal out deep views and form large plans like that
great Countess."</p>

<p>Of the lawyer, on the other hand, she formed a
far more merciful opinion than the rest of the party;
and she was so far right that he possessed great
acquirements, but his judgment was defective.
M. Courdemont was not content with his college
fame as a mathematician; nor with confining his
geometry and his algebra to their more ordinary
and legitimate employment. He had his peculiar
theories on various other matters, into which he imported
the services of the severer sciences. Thus
being long-sighted, as persons past their prime are
apt to be, and aware that this arises from the lens of
the eye becoming flattened by age, he must needs

<!-- vol 1 page 30 -->

apply muscular exertion to his eyes when reading
or writing, and was in a state of hideous contortion,
while his neighbour quietly sate with a pair of spectacles
on his nose, and saw a deal better, though ten
years older. So too, he had his theory of the moves
at chess, and would, while a cause was going on in
court, be going through a game according to his
own rules. Whether he had as bad fortune when
matched against himself, may be uncertain; but it is
quite certain that playing with any one else he was
always sure to be beaten. His adversary, however,
had reason, like Pyrrhus of old, to rue his victory,
and exclaim, that another such would be his ruin;
for he had to suffer under an hour's lecture, demonstrating
by the rules of algebra that he ought
clearly to have been check-mated.</p>

<p>Next day there came to the Ch&acirc;teau two visitors,
whose arrival could not be otherwise than interesting,&mdash;M.
and Mme. de Montricard. They belonged
to Aix, but passed part of the year at
Nismes, near which M. de Montricard had property.
He was a young gentleman in high estimation
for his abilities and accomplishments, which
fitted him for filling any station, but his tastes led
him rather to the active sports of the chase and the

<!-- vol 1 page 31 -->

man&egrave;ge; while his wife was almost as fond of politics
as Mme.de Chatillon herself. In some particulars
they differed widely; Madame de Montricard,
though a person of great beauty, was not equal in
this respect to the Countess, having a less brilliant
air, and less handsome figure; but in all other
respects, as talents, information, even wit, she shone
equally, and her temper and disposition were incomparably
more amiable. She had a large family,
to whom she was an exemplary mother,
and the breath of slander never having assailed
her reputation, the men of Nismes indemnified
themselves by pronouncing her as cold as ice. It
was a cold, however, that repulsed not, if it encouraged
not; and she wisely reckoned that it served to
secure her friendships as well as her respectability.
She would quietly make it the subject of a pleasantry
or a sensible remark; and once on being
charged with it by a person whom she thought
somewhat pertinacious in his objection, and who was
constantly saying, that she had all manner of
knowledge except knowing how to love&mdash;she wrote
a quatrain with her pencil, as her explanation
and her defence, which may be thus translated,
though she said at the time that if fiction be the

<!-- vol 1 page 32 -->

soul of song, her lines were much too true to be
poetical.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Platonic love too chill may seem<br/>

For mortals to endure;<br/>

Two merits yet that fault redeem&mdash;<br/>

'Tis lasting, and 'tis pure."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>All the wise men, both literary and political, of
Nismes and of Aix, were fond of consulting her.
With none was she so intimate as with the Second
Judge in Languedoc, M. de Balaye; but love-making,
of course, neither suited his station nor her
tastes; and hence their intercourse was uninterrupted
with any quarrels, though it so happened that he
had been a strong political opponent of her father,
a man of great eminence in his day. The Judge
used to consult her in all matters, even scientific,
declaring he knew no sounder judgment, and few
more amiable dispositions.</p>

<p>Her success in society was universal. The
Countess could not bear the mention of her name,
undervalued her looks, laughed at her pretensions,
and assured the Baron that he would find the
grapes in this quarter really sour, if they were, by
any miracle, to drop into his mouth. There was
little fear of his trying their flavour; for he was

<!-- vol 1 page 33 -->

already enslaved elsewhere, and he took but little
pleasure in her conversation.</p>

<p>The Ch&acirc;teau de Bagnolles in its interior arrangements
corresponded with the beauty of its structure,
and the scale and the style of its grounds. A convenient
parlour, but not so vast as the dining-room,
received the family at breakfast. It was hung with
Canaletti pictures of Venice and the terra-firma
towns; the freshness of the colour, especially the blue
canals, pleasing and resting the eye. At either end
was a sofa, under a case of books, to prevent the time
from hanging heavy on those that might assemble a
little earlier than the rest. On one or other sofa, you
might find a priest of the Church and a pastor from
Nismes discussing points of doctrine or of discipline,
till the entry of the Marchioness announced that it
was time to descend from the higher regions and
pay a due attention to the demands of our humbler
nature. From the breakfast the company generally
retired either to the spacious library, so laid out that
no book was above reach, and indented with recesses
for reading or conversing uninterruptedly; or they
went out to enjoy the fine air, free from heat, in a
shady portico upon which the parlour opened. In
this portico were benches placed conveniently among

<!-- vol 1 page 34 -->

the pillars and marbles which supported or adorned
it. Here much time was usually passed; and as the
steps, only two in number, led to the fine walk communicating
at one end with the garden, at the other
with the wood and the lake, the portico naturally
became a rendezvous both before the drives and
walks which the party might take and after they
returned home; so that it was a joke in the Ch&acirc;teau,
borrowed from the old steward, Gaspar, who had
been brought up in trade at Marseilles, that the
portico was the Exchange of Bagnolles (<i>Bourse de
Bagnolles</i>).</p>

<p>The hospitality of the house kept a full proportion
to its ample means; there was no distinction of
sects suffered to interfere; the family, though Protestant,
were highly respected by the clergy for their
sincere yet tolerant piety; to see their friends about
them, and contribute to their comforts or enjoyment,
seemed to be their own chief gratification; few distinguished
strangers passed through Languedoc
without visiting Bagnolles, and when the parties were
found to suit each other, a second visit never failed
to follow, and to last for such a time that the Sieur
Gaspar would remark on the Marquess keeping the
best inn in all France, and the most reasonable.

<!-- vol 1 page 35 -->

One thing, however, detracted, it was said, from the
accuracy of the Sieur's comparison. Guests who
proved tiresome, or empty and frivolous, or in any
way either unpleasant or unprofitable companions,
never stopped long nor came twice. "Aye," said
Gaspar, "then we do make travellers pay; somewhat
they must contribute, though it may be in their
person, and not in their purse."</p>

<div class="center" id="v1ch02">

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">THE CAVE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Countess, whose attention was ever awake,
and whose observation was always on the alert
regarding others, as she never had any love-affairs
upon her own hands, had remarked that every day
when the heat of the weather permitted, the Marchioness
went out alone through the flower-garden
upon which her boudoir opened, and which was commanded
by the windows of the Countess's apartment.
She had a small basket in her hand, somewhat
larger than could be used merely to carry flowers,
and she generally covered this over with the loose
cloak thrown upon her arm. Had Mme. de Chatillon
seen this but once or twice, it might not have
struck her as extraordinary. But when it happened
day after day, and never less than three or four
times in a week, some mystery seemed to be involved&mdash;the

<!-- vol 1 page 37 -->

rather that having once taken notice of
it, and offered to accompany her friend to "the cottage
where she went to dispense her charities" (so she
framed what our lawyers call her fishing question),
she perceived an evident embarrassment, the subject
being immediately warded off by a change on the
Marchioness's part in the conversation.</p>

<p>The suspicious nature of the Countess now had
full scope, and as she connected everything with
politics, nothing with love, she failed not to imagine
that some refugee from the arbitrary power
of the government, or of the church, was concealed
in the forest, to whose wants the hostess was ministering.
The family being not only Huguenot, but
having embraced the liberal opinions now spreading
so fast over France, and the people of Nismes having
shown on various occasions a strong disposition
to ferment, greatly strengthened the Countess's
suspicions, which she communicated to her husband;
but his easy and careless nature could not be fixed
upon the question, which seemed little to concern
him, while he pursued his favourite occupations of
the chase and of the riding-house. She therefore
took her own course, and set a watch upon the Marchioness
in the person of her maid, holding it quite

<!-- vol 1 page 38 -->

clear that the manner in which her inquiries had
been balked by her friend gave her a full right to
prosecute them in her own way. She had at different
times spoken on the subject to the two or three
young men who were visitors at the Ch&acirc;teau, and
who professed a devotion to her commands, while
she used them to gather information for her, and in
all other respects, except graciously accepting their
services and their admiration, treated them with
sufficient contempt, above all laughing without any
reserve at their gallantry as often as they thought
fit to express any feeling beyond mere admiration.
None of them had on the present occasion shown
any activity in the matter, possibly from feeling that
the indulgence of any curiosity on a subject plainly
covered with a veil by their kind and amiable
hostess, would betoken a want of due delicacy
in her guests. The Abigail was therefore, in the
natural course of things, resorted to, and she, in the
same natural course, opened a communication with
her friend, the valet, who having been unfaithful to
his sweetheart, for whom he daily vowed the most
eternal and exuberant love, had solaced himself with
an attempt upon the heart of the Countess's confidential
woman, and had so plied her with Parisian

<!-- vol 1 page 39 -->

anecdotes, with court gossip, with political gossip,
with travelling gossip, and so dazzled her with
cheap trinkets and mock laces, that he had gained
upon the country and Huguenot fair one, notwithstanding
her suspicions of all who went to mass and
crossed themselves before and after meat. Through
these worthy and sharp-sighted personages the inquiry
made some progress; for it was ascertained
that the mysterious basket contained provisions, and
that the Marchioness's walk lasted seldom less than
an hour, so that she must have some way to go; it
was also certain that the basket returned empty.
The Countess's curiosity was now exalted to the
utmost pitch, and she once more made an attempt,
but it was the last one her courage ventured upon,
to wring the secret from her friend. It was an offer
to assist her in what she "plainly saw was a compassionate
work." "Beware the anger of a good-natured
man,"&mdash;is a proverb, or at least is so true,
so much the practical result of experience, that it
deserves to be one. The mild and even-tempered
Marchioness, who had already felt annoyed with
her friend's questions, and especially with the plots
she perceived her laying to inveigle her into a disclosure,
broke forth: "Countess, you have more than

<!-- vol 1 page 40 -->

once pursued this course with me, and you have
failed. Once for all hear me, and believe me when
I tell you that all your man&oelig;uvring will not succeed
in drawing from me the least hint to gratify
your restless and endless curiosity. I let your
secrets alone; pray leave me in possession of
my own." So unwonted a vigour, and such plain
indications of humour, had two effects on the
Countess; she felt her stay at the Ch&acirc;teau become
somewhat irksome, and she felt all her curiosity
redoubled by this signal failure, with the addition of
resentment, for the treatment she had experienced
at the hands of one whose understanding she despised.
She concealed her feelings, gave a general
assurance of regret at having unintentionally
given pain, and retired within herself to meditate
the means of healing the wound she had
received, and gratifying at once her curiosity and
her revenge.</p>

<p>Her trusty minions failed not soon to make some
progress in their investigations. Their speculations
were short; the theory to which they led was plain
and simple; it was embraced with the most unhesitating
confidence. The Marchioness, it was quite
plain, had a lover; she met him secretly in the

<!-- vol 1 page 41 -->

forest, and her basket contained a slender repast for
the tender pair, while it threw over their transgression
the all-covering cloak of charity. But still
curiosity was on the stretch to find out the person
favoured by the Marchioness, and above all to show
her that she was discovered and so in their power.
Many days did not pass before the valet found in
the deepest recess of the forest, a track branching
from the thicket to which one of the unfrequented
paths led. Following this track, he came upon a
torrent which lost itself among lofty rocks crowned
with overhanging wood, in a dell as gloomy as the
fancy could paint, and more dark than the eye could
pierce. The first rains of autumn had swelled this
water-course, and yet there were blocks of stone
rudely fashioned and placed across it, over which it
did not flow. The accident of finding a lady's hair
pin on the first of these blocks, left no doubt in
the man's enquiring mind, that this was the path
which led to the supposed Dido's cave; and he
crossed over with breathless impatience, making
sure of no longer being balked, as he so often had
been, by the thickness of the wood during the last
week of his pursuit, when he had taken more
exercise than in any whole year of his lazy life.

<!-- vol 1 page 42 -->

He was soon on the other side, and found another
path by which his steps were again led to the torrent,
and here he lost all trace of any foot-way. He
thought, however, that he could perceive a plank
resting against a part of the rock that jutted out
over the stream, and felt assured that this was used
by some one to ascend from the edge of the water.
With the utmost difficulty he clambered up the
steep sides of the bank among the tangled bushes
and trees. Having reached the summit he looked
down towards the torrent, and saw standing upon a
narrow but flat space on its margin, in a musing
posture, with his arms folded, a tall man dressed in
black with long brown hair, and a beard of the same
colour that descended towards his breast. So
sudden an apparition affrighted him, and he retreated
down the bank, having hardly ventured to
look at the stranger's features. He hurried home
by the path he had taken, and full of his discovery
hastened to communicate all he had seen to his
friend Jeanette, who repeated it with the usual
exaggerations to the Countess, not forgetting to
paint the lonely stranger as in the prime of youth,
and of the rarest beauty; facts necessarily unknown
to her, inasmuch as her sweetheart had been in

<!-- vol 1 page 43 -->

much too great a fright to observe any thing of the
kind before he fled.</p>

<p>That lady was now completely gratified. She
had her revenge within her own power. Falling
into the doctrine of the servants, she no longer
doubted that the secret walks of the Marchioness
were connected with a deeply rooted, and as deeply
concealed passion. Her curiosity was appeased.
But how to obtain the full measure of revenge was
a more difficult matter. With all her courage, she
hardly ventured to charge her friend directly, for
she knew the irreproachable reputation which belonged
to her; nor could she bear the thought of
having her stratagems found out, and the low agents
through whom she had been working, known. After
much reflection she resolved to obtain the directions
of the servant, and herself to pursue the track he had
taken; so she made the Count her confidant, whom
she found enamoured of the Marchioness (a thing
that gave her no pain), and whose own attachment
was thus interested in pursuing the discovery. Ever
obedient to her will, indeed, he easily consented to
accompany her, according to the description given
by the maid from her lover's account. It was afterwards
settled that at first he alone should explore;

<!-- vol 1 page 44 -->

and after several fruitless attempts, he, one day that
the Marchioness had gone to pass the morning at
Nismes, succeeded in reaching the rock where the
foot-plank was found placed so as to join the
edge of the river with that eminence. The Count
bounded up the path with the lightness of the
roe, and in an instant found himself in the presence
of the mysterious Solitary; and almost at
the same moment felt his throat grasped hard by
a powerful hand, while another held a dagger to
his heart.</p>

<p>The Count's orders on his breast at once showed
that he was there by accident or from curiosity
alone; he was also unarmed; the grip was relaxed,
and the dagger withdrawn. But the long-bearded
man burst forth in furious accents:&mdash;"And
who art thou that darest to intrude upon my deep
concealment with thy poor, paltry, unmannerly
curiosity? Knowest thou the risk its mean gratification
exposed thee to? Had but the weapon of
chase or the gun of the huntsman been about thy
person, at this moment thou hadst ceased to live!
Yes! I am a Christian, aye, a Christian Minister.
Yet yielding obedience to the first of laws, the law
of self-defence, had it been possible for me to believe

<!-- vol 1 page 45 -->

that there stood here in my power a minister of the
justice which pursues me for yielding obedience to
the second law of nature, the law that rules our social
affections, my dagger would have been plunged into
his bosom, and his corse have been buried in the
torrent, my protector and my accomplice, that roars
beneath this cave!"</p>

<p>The horror with which Chatillon heard that he
stood in the presence of a felon, perhaps a murderer,
certainly of one who was prepared for deeds
of slaughter, hardly left him the power of observing
how perfectly beautiful a form and expressive a
countenance was worn by the stranger. He endeavoured
to excuse himself for an intrusion which he
felt to be rash and also unwarranted, or warranted
only by his habitual obedience to her who had
commissioned him on this errand. But he was
speedily interrupted with&mdash;"Enough! No more!
Begone! and learn to respect and to avoid this
spot, well assured that if the knowledge you have
chanced to gain of this retreat shall ever lead
to others approaching it with different designs,
you shall then have seen the sun for the last
time; you will be pursued, though the mountains
were to cover you, and your punishment be instantaneous,

<!-- vol 1 page 46 -->

before my destruction can be accomplished!"</p>

<p>The Count waited not for a second warning; he
swiftly descended the plank which he heard rapidly
moved up the rock after he had passed down; and
in a very short time he was stretched breathless,
exhausted, and agitated on the sofa in his wife's
apartment. She felt somewhat of his alarm at so
unexpected a sight, and was impatient for his being
able to tell his story. It threw her into one of those
fits of reflection and imagination in which her designs
were usually conceived. Her first impression
was one of disappointment at her theory of the
Marchioness's conduct being found less intelligible,
though she still adhered to its outline; but the feeling
that next succeeded was pointed against her unfortunate
partner, whom she at once charged with
want of spirit and determination.&mdash;"Had I been a
man, or any thing in the shape of one, think you I
should have let this concealed paramour throttle me
unpunished?"&mdash;"My love," replied the Count, with
his accustomed mildness, which never failed to increase
her irritation, "pray reflect that I put myself
completely in the wrong by intruding where I had
no right to be."&mdash;"In the wrong?" she replied, "as

<!-- vol 1 page 47 -->

if that signified, when he profaned your person with
his hands!"&mdash;"Well then, dearest, recollect that
he had drawn from his girdle a dagger, while I
was unarmed; to say nothing of his far greater
strength."&mdash;"Had you not the roaring torrent close
beneath for your ally? Could you not have at once
washed out in its waters your own disgrace, and
buried in them the pious Marchioness's sins?"&mdash;"Catherine!
Catherine!" said her justly offended
and shocked husband, "stay these your unseemly
reproaches, and a thousand times more unseemly
suggestions! What man can do have I ever done
to love, honour, and obey you, giving honour, as it
seemed due, to the stronger vessel! But one step
will I not take in the path of crime to gratify your
inordinate ambition, or slake your boundless thirst
for vengeance! God of his mercy forbid that any
blood, most of all any innocent blood, should ever
lie on my soul!"</p>

<p>There was a determination of manner and of
purpose so marked in the loud tone and the firm
voice which now, for the first time, filled her ear,
that she was reduced to silence, and even said,
"Perhaps I was wrong. But I will not forgive
her whose intrigues have caused me this. I will

<!-- vol 1 page 48 -->

steadily pursue the inquiry. Be you sure of
that!"</p>

<p>Chatillon, who, far from sharing in her suspicions,
felt entirely convinced that the whole matter, on the
Marchioness's part, had its origin in feelings very
different from lawless love, yet dreading his wife's
reckless and restless disposition when once any
scheme had got possession of her, was determined
at once to make Mme. de Bagnolles herself his confidant,
to prevent any further mischief, and even assist
in a design, which he could not doubt was wholly
founded in charity and compassion for some unhappy,
perhaps persecuted, individual. She, on her part,
having the utmost reliance upon his honour, and
knowing that she could trust the kindness of his nature,
also gave him every encouragement in his disclosure,
and though she was deeply impressed with
his wife's misconduct, yet, holding him free from
all blame but that of having too yielding a nature
when his duty required more firm resistance, promised
to beg that the Hermit would receive him,
and, in the course of a few days, took him with her
to the cave, by a somewhat less entangled path, with
which she alone was acquainted.</p>

<p>She had taken the very necessary precaution of

<!-- vol 1 page 49 -->

preparing the Solitary for his reception; giving a
just panegyric of his amiable and honourable character;
and accordingly, the stern and even terrible
manner which he had before been dismayed with,
was now composed into a calm and not uncourteous
dignity of demeanour, which only served to render
his countenance more impressive, and his figure more
striking. There was still, however, a lofty and
distant tone in all he said; and the first interview
passed without more than a permission to come
alone, of which the Count soon availed himself.
This led to a repetition of these visits; for he took
much interest in this intercourse with a person so
singular in his circumstances, and had a natural
curiosity to hear more of his history than the few
general intimations of the Marchioness disclosed.
The Solitary on the other hand was exceedingly
attracted by his new acquaintance, whose suavity of
temper and ingenuous disposition gained much
upon him, and whose acute understanding he soon
learnt to appreciate. His principles too, were of
that liberal cast which were then beginning to spread
over France. A confidence thus growing up between
them, very unlike the feelings that attended the
beginning of their acquaintance, the stranger desired

<!-- vol 1 page 50 -->

him to come one morning early to his retreat,
when he thus unfolded, for his own defence and that
of his kind protectress, the mystery of his present
situation.</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="small">THE MONK.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">If</span> I say that the sun does not rise upon a more
wretched being to light him on his way towards the
much-wished-for tomb which every motive drives to
seek, and one paramount duty forbids to enter, I
use not words of common course, ever in the mouths
of those who only half know sorrow; I speak the
sentiments of my inmost heart. You are young;
you may live to be old; but through all your life,
be it ever so prolonged, your eye will never rest
upon more misery than it now beholds.</p>

<p>"Know, then, that I was born of a noble family,
though somewhat reduced in its circumstances, and no
longer, as its ancestors had done in past times, dispensing
the charities and performing the duties of
large possessions. My early years, however, were
spent with kind parents who had ample means of
supporting and educating me. I had a brother

<!-- vol 1 page 52 -->

much older than myself, to whom all the family
looked up as endowed with commanding and various
talents, capable of anything, as was the current
expression of the house; but ruled by a fiery and
ungovernable temper, which gave him, it was
thought, little prospect of worldly success. He left
us when I was but a boy, and he had reached man's
estate; nor did we even discover which road he took,
much less what were his future fortunes. One parent
still survives; the other I have lost; she believed I had,
like my brother, paid the debt of nature; and it is
not one of my least afflictions that I shall never more
be permitted to look upon her whom, of all human
beings save one, I most constantly and warmly loved.</p>

<p>"You will perceive, from what I have said, that
the choice of a profession was likely to be made for
me, or by me, with a view to pressing as lightly as
possible upon the family resources. I was destined
for the bar; and it was the design of my father to
save by practising the strictest economy as much as
might suffice to purchase a judicial place in either
the courts of Montpellier or of Toulouse; these
offices being saleable by one of the ancient abuses of
our government, an abuse the effects of which are so
far mitigated by manners and the habits of society

<!-- vol 1 page 53 -->

that it produces very few of the evils naturally to be
apprehended from its manifestly mischievous tendency.
In the course, however, of my preparatory studies
for assuming the robe, I had been brought in contact
with several ecclesiastics; and I had formed as
great an intimacy with one of this body as could
well be cemented between persons of ages so unequal.
I was barely eighteen and he was turned of five-and-thirty.</p>

<p>"He was a friar of the Benedictine order, a man
of profound learning, and of the most winning address;
of a temper the most placid I have ever
known, but of principles as fixed as his feelings
were lofty; and, although singularly gifted with
both a liberal judgment and a calm mind, yet from
the perfect sincerity of his nature, and the powerful
hold which his opinions had of his mind, as strongly
touched with enthusiasm as was consistent with an
intellect so vigorous and acute. Indeed, even in
these early years, and while the sphere of my observation
was still as limited as that of my experience,
I used to remark with interest and curiosity the
kind of conflict which his zeal maintained against
his extraordinary sagacity; and to contrast the ease
and the quickness of his perception when other

<!-- vol 1 page 54 -->

men's errors were the subject of discussion, with the
slowness he evinced to give up his own. I had
been carefully educated by my excellent mother in
the habit of consulting my reason on all subjects of
dispute; and, although the dogmas and the mysteries
of religion were excluded from the list, yet I
could not believe that the peculiar tenets and observances
of the cloister were reconcileable either with
right reason or with the genuine spirit of the Christian
revelation. To those tenets and observances,
he without any reasoning clung. Such was Father
Jerome. The vast superiority of his attainments,
the large experience by which he was trained, the
practice of disputation which had rendered him a
consummate master of the logical art, above all his
varied and accurate learning, placed me at a distance
from him so immeasurable, that I by degrees,
and without being sensible of it, became so entirely
subjected to his influence, that my original habit of
thinking for myself left me, and I seemed, not only
to feel with his heart and yield to his understanding,
but to see with his eyes, to have but one being and
one soul with him. But I doubt if all his solid acquirements
and real talents could have gained such
a mastery over me at that age, when the most solid

<!-- vol 1 page 55 -->

merits are far from making their due impression,
had I not also been dazzled with his great knowledge
of the world and of mankind, for I was to live
in that world and not in the cloister. He had taken
the vow after attaining a certain age, in consequence
of a disappointment in love; and I have often since
reflected on the nice discrimination of character and
the profound and just remarks on manners which
shone through his conversation, and which, though I
might not at the time perceive their deep sense, I have
since learnt fully to appreciate. For example, he
would say, 'Observe the noblesse of our provinces,
imitators of their caste in Paris, and, indeed, importing
from thence much of the vice and frivolity
with which they make our society corrupt and ridiculous.
See the riddles which they present, but
which may all be solved by selfishness. Most of our
Counts and Barons pass their time in laying siege
to the virtue of our countrywomen, and manifestly
proceed upon the supposition that not one is impregnable
to their stratagems and their assaults. Whom
they cannot wear out by blockade, they think they
can take by storm. Yet only mention to any man
of them all that this Countess or that Marchioness
has yielded to any one of their friends, and he will

<!-- vol 1 page 56 -->

at once deny it, as if he were the lady's champion.
And, why? Merely because every man is jealous
of all others, even with regard to women whose
virtue he never attempted. For if, without naming
any particular person as successful, you give the
lady the far worse character of promiscuous libertinage,
M. le Comte will at once acquiesce.'</p>

<p>" 'Are the same things to be remarked in the
women?' I have asked. 'No, not the same&mdash;
but they have their paradox too, though they will
eagerly lower everyone to their own standard, there
being nothing so credulous of other women's frailties
as those who are themselves frail. Yet as to
the charms of others, you may always expect to
find them extremely niggard of their admiration
where real beauty or fascination exists, and abundantly
apt to commend generously the plain and
the unattractive.'</p>

<p>"Then he would comment on the folly of the
world, as living, he would say, at cross purposes and
in voluntary self-deception. 'See our great merchants
giving their entertainments and their wives
giving their assemblies at which no cost is spared,
nor any pains to invite guests. They ask you as if
the favour was done to them by your acceptance;

<!-- vol 1 page 57 -->

yet they all the while have a feeling that they are
obliging you, and their gratitude seems to be because
you let yourself be laid under that obligation to
them; perhaps, too, it is their thankfulness for having
an opportunity of displaying their wealth; for
certainly what is called hospitality very mainly consists
in this; in saying inwardly, "See how much I
can afford to spend;" and not seldom it is all false
and hollow, and much more than can be afforded
is spent to give colour to that vain trumpery boast.'
He used to tell me of another class by no means in
small numbers whom I should frequently meet in
the world, persons who were always very reasonably
expecting that men should give them credit for
uniting in their own persons the most opposite and
repugnant qualities. 'I have known,' he would
say, 'libertines who were extremely offended if you
supposed them tight-laced; and yet must needs
desire to pass with men of probity, for leading strict
and temperate lives. But if you should say that
this is only a common kind of hypocrisy or double
dealing, what say you to a class by no means rare
in society, of persons who will insist upon having
credit for the very conduct they never held, and the
very qualities that don't belong to them? There is

<!-- vol 1 page 58 -->

the Baron de l'Escaut, whose family came from Flanders,
and who is narrow and saving even to meanness.
Yet he is haunted with a love of ostentation that torments
him unceasingly. While he is doing the very
shabbiest things in the world, he will insist upon
passing for a mighty lord, who cares nothing for
expense, and is the munificent patron of all who
approach him. He gave as a wedding present to
his cousin an old carriage not worth repairing, and
fit only to be broken up for firewood, and spoke of
this bounty as if he had set the young man up with
a span new equipage!'&mdash;I recollect once when
Father Jerome was dwelling on this chapter of
human folly, having remarked that it was not confined,
apparently, to persons living in the great
world, and pampered by the caprices they figured
among, for I had remarked in one or two of our
teachers a similar inconsistency. They would be
extremely wroth if any one charged them with
having written certain papers that were admired,
but of somewhat free opinions on political matters,
in the Montpellier Journal, and yet would be not
a little ruffled if any one either ascribed them to
other pens, or declared themselves incapable of propagating
such doctrines, 'Aye, truly,' said the

<!-- vol 1 page 59 -->

Father, 'they remind one of Charles XII., who
travelled incognito, and went to war with a German
Prince for taking him to be what he pretended, and
treating him as a Baron, not a King.' He added,
however, more seriously, 'My good young man,
never forget the lesson these men teach by their
folly&mdash;it is to shun anonymous writing. It only
exposes them, perhaps, to a little ridicule, if it does
not also taint them with a little duplicity. But it
is for a person of your abilities, and who are rising
into a learned rank, the most dangerous of seductions,
nourishing the worst of vices, the roots of all
evil, the sappers of character.'&mdash;'And which,' I asked,
'be they?'&mdash;'Malice, falsehood, and cowardice,'
was the reply.</p>

<p>"I have said enough to show how near an observer
of men this friar was while yet in the world,
and how little he had forgotten them when buried
in the cloister. It was in minute particulars as
in greater things, that his perspicacity was acute.
Nothing seemed too small for his fine vision. 'You
will find,' said he one day while I observed upon
the form of a fellow-student's finger; 'you will
find that nobody, no man at least, cares to have you
look narrowly at his hands. I believe, from what

<!-- vol 1 page 60 -->

I have heard, that women are as scrupulous about
having their feet examined unless when well covered.'
It struck me at the time that this latter
remark betokened a larger experience than I had
given him credit for, but with the intuitive sagacity
of his nature, and as if he had read what was passing
within me, he added, 'Sister Ursula first made
this remark to me upon her sex.'</p>

<p>"Such was Father Jerome, and so formed to captivate
a novice as I was, yet more inexperienced in
the ways of the world than in the forces which
disturbed the paths of the planets. The fascination
of his rare qualities and of his delightful manners
was increased by the affection which he showed me.
Precluded by his state, and by the cruel, unnatural
law under which he lived, from all the endearments
of a family, he seemed to regard me as
his son; and I cannot well express the joy I felt
when I found the object of my admiration and deep
respect took a pleasure in my society, and even
in consulting me, whose mind his instructions had
formed and trained. There is a delight not easy
to describe conveyed to a youth escaped from the
season of careless boyhood and from its thraldom,
when, touching upon man's estate but of a doubtful

<!-- vol 1 page 61 -->

title to its privileges, he finds himself cherished as
a friend by one much older, and who admits him
to a footing of equality like a man. Ambition may
have some part in this feeling; vanity, thus gratified,
has more; and with this is mingled the leaning
upon the superior mind for protection. All these
things enter largely into the love of woman for
our sex. The homage we pay them, though their
masters in strength and in understanding, soothes
them, and they look up to us for defence; they
lean upon us for counsel and guidance. The
ardent love which they often feel for men much
older than themselves, and of comparatively feeble
personal attractions, is only to be explained by
these sentiments, in which all love mainly originates.</p>

<p>"I never shall forget the exultation which filled
my mind when, after having for two years set him
before me as the object of unceasing admiration, I
found that he entertained for me feelings of friendship
and confidence. These he had not before
shown, apprehensive that favouritism might be imputed
to him by the five or six other pupils who
were with me pursuing their studies at the same
convent. It was one evening, while taking our

<!-- vol 1 page 62 -->

accustomed walk in the beautiful garden of the
House, where, under a fine lime-walk, we sat down
upon a bench, and he went on to descant upon the
extraordinary provisions by which the stability of
the solar system is secured, referring to the chain of
demonstration by which he had shown in his lectures
that the mutual actions of the heavenly bodies
upon each other, while they prevent their motions
from being ever continued in one orbit, yet also set
limits to their deviations from the elliptical path.
He perceived my eye glisten with the feeling of
rapture which such proofs of divine power and skill
naturally excite, and, seizing my hand, he said, 'I
know, and have long known, you to be superior to
my other pupils. You are cast in another mould.
You inspire me with a confidence which springs
from congenial character; and I regard you more
as a friend than a pupil.' When he spoke of confidence,
it was not that he had any secrets to disclose
either as to his conduct or his opinions. That
was pure and blameless; these were strictly orthodox;
nor did his devotion to human science ever
lead him away from his religious pursuits, much
less interfere with the submissive deference wherewithal
he bowed in all things to the decisions of an

<!-- vol 1 page 63 -->

infallible church. If he did not, with the commentators
on Newton, affect to disbelieve the true doctrine
of astronomy; if with Galileo, rising from a
recantation of his heterodoxy, he firmly exclaimed,
'<i>e pur si muove!</i>'&mdash;he yet meditated much with the
holy men of Galilee on divine things, and could
easily reconcile the implicit belief of revelation with
the discoveries of science which the Divine Author of
that revelation has graciously enabled his creatures
to make by the faculties he has bestowed on them.
But by 'confidence,' he meant that he could share
with me his feelings, communicate his opinions,
and discuss the numberless little points of dispute
which arise among the members of a monastery;
few of whom had anything like his enlargement of
views, and none of whom possessed his modest,
amiable, humble disposition. To be thus treated
by such a man as his equal, filled me with joy and
pride; it was the gratification of all the ambition
I had ever felt; and I never looked forward to the
honours of my destined profession as capable of
raising me more in my own estimation than did the
friendship and the confidence of Father Jerome.</p>

<p>"A year glided away in this delightful intercourse;
but it was a year not wholly devoted to

<!-- vol 1 page 64 -->

studies that might prepare me for the courts of
Toulouse and Montpellier. I enjoyed the purest
gratification in the continued society of my accomplished
teacher; and my studious attention to the
lessons he taught was only exceeded by my devotion
to his authority. I found, however, that my
father was alarmed at the small portion of my
time which was given to jurisprudence; and perceiving
the ascendant which Father Jerome had gained
over me, and the pride I took in his friendship,
he one day seriously warned me against imbibing
a taste for the monastic life. My mother joined
in the same entreaties, with that greater gentleness
and more fond affection which armed every word of
hers with irresistible force. Alas! the deed was
done; the taste already imbibed! Though the friar
had never spoken one word to me on the subject,
nay, rather had received with a repulsive coldness
my advances to proselytism, I yet had become enamoured
of the tranquil life he led, the sublime
studies which I saw he pursued in his convent; and
I could little bear the vulgar contention of the courts
which I occasionally had witnessed, with all the
more disrelish that they were petty, provincial tribunals.
I could still less endure the thoughts of being

<!-- vol 1 page 65 -->

separated from my guide and friend, being severed
by a great distance from his fixed residence, and
being thrown among strangers, towards whom I felt
neither affection nor admiration. It was not long
before he discovered the bent of my inclinations;
nor did he fail to combat it. He honestly and
strongly opened to me all the evils of monastic
life; the jealousies and heartburnings of the monks;
the rigour of their discipline; the tyranny, often the
caprice of the superior; above all, the unnatural
subjugation of our strongest passions, and the yet
more dreadful restraint of our most powerful and
most innocent feelings, which the inflexible severity
of the vow imposes. With delicacy he alluded to
my naturally ardent temperament, and more plainly
hinted at the strength of my affections, that bore
their due proportion to the constitution of my bodily
frame; and he never failed to set before me the one
prevailing motto:&mdash;'Whoso enters the cloister seals
his fate for ever in this world, leaving himself no
return from his voluntary grave!' But though his
honest nature led him thus far, and to the very edge
of his duty, his vow to further the interests of his
order would not suffer him to go one step beyond
it; and most brethren, in his situation, would rather

<!-- vol 1 page 66 -->

have removed than raised any obstacles to my becoming
a novice. His pains were taken only in
setting fairly before me the consequences of the step
I was bent on taking; and this he did with all the
force of his persuasive eloquence. But all was in
vain. I was too young to take prospective views,
to cast my look forward into the dark future; too
ardent to see difficulties, or weigh the sober lessons
of experience. I saw of a convent only its quiet
chambers, its noble library, its green and shady
walks; saw of its inmates only the studious habits,
the contemplative life, the pious devotion to religious
duties, the tranquil existence, withdrawn
from all worldly bustle, and consecrated to kindly
charity, or to learned ease. With these prepossessions
powerfully co-operated my fervent attachment
to Father Jerome, and my repugnance to any
change that should separate me from his guidance,
and sever the ties of friendship which had insensibly
been formed and had knit me to the brethren of
the convent.</p>

<p>"A few months of earnest entreaty, and a conviction
that resistance to the bent of my inclination
must prove vain, coupled perhaps with some religious
feeling on the subject, overcame the reluctance

<!-- vol 1 page 67 -->

of my parents, and I entered upon my noviciate.
The year which this requires was the happiest
of my whole life; nor can anything be more groundless
than the notion that in cases of voluntary entering
upon the monastic state, a trial is thus made of
the devotee's taste for it. That taste is far more
likely to be confirmed than weakened by the probation.
Accordingly the Council of Trent required
that each female novice should, before being allowed
to take the veil, leave the convent for some time,
after her probationary year has expired, and, at her
own home, be examined by her parents and by the
bishop as to her fitness and her disposition for the
holy state of the Saviour's wedded spouse. My
year expired with a great increase of my resolution;
and I finally was received and made my vows.</p>

<p>"I suppose no one, except perhaps he belonged to
the class of the common people, who become members
of the smaller orders for a lazy subsistence, and
whose minds are little struck with the ceremonial of
their reception, will ever forget that awful proceeding.
Every particular of it remains deeply engraven on
my memory after the lapse of many years; and,
fully as I had been prepared for it, and entirely as
my mind went along with the step I was taking, an

<!-- vol 1 page 68 -->

involuntary shudder came over me as I was slowly
and solemnly consigned to a living tomb. Though
I had several times been present at the same ceremony
in the case of others, the sensations which I
experienced in my own were such as I never had
been at all prepared to expect; they gave a bias to
my mind which afterwards did not fail to produce
the most powerful and the most unhappy effects; indeed
I question if I should not have drawn back and
recanted my resolution had I distinctly foreseen
what I was to feel; as I suppose men have committed
suicide, repenting of it after the fatal draught
was swallowed which the instant before they had
eagerly commended to their lips. Certain it is that
my firm grasp of the chalice relaxed suddenly, and
I was all but ready to dash it on the ground.</p>

<p>"The ceremonial of reception is abundantly calculated
to impress the mind of the neophyte; and on
some, to help in producing the consternation which
I felt on first feeling that I had been irrevocably
entombed, when just entering on man's estate. High
mass succeeds to the magnificent air of <i>Adeste Fidelis</i>,
which fills the vaulted roofs, now thundering and
now warbling&mdash;solemn or delightful. The novice
experiences, far more awfully than before, a feeling

<!-- vol 1 page 69 -->

that the daily recurrence of the Mass had deadened
the actual presence of the Deity himself, in the temple
made with hands; for it seems as if the Godhead
had descended to witness and to seal the vows,
ready to avenge a breach of the covenant made with
the Almighty Father. This is the prevailing idea
that fills the mind throughout the ceremony; and
more especially as the Host is raised with numberless
bells to fix the attention upon the awful symbol
now become a real presence; but the choirs of sweet
and powerful voices which thrill the senses, the chant
of the well-selected Scriptures and prayers, the full
organ interposing from time to time, the multitude
of tapers diffusing their dim religious light over the
splendid vestments of the ministers, the devout obeisances
of these, comporting themselves as actually
before the Divine Majesty&mdash;all fill the mind with
feelings far removed from earthly things. The exhortation,
addressed partly to the novice, partly to
the auditory, would perhaps make less impression
than any other part of the ceremony, except that it
comes immediately before the terrible vow. The
time for that was now come; I pronounced the vow,
and as the sacred vestment was thrown over me,
with the words 'God put on thee the new man with

<!-- vol 1 page 70 -->

this garment! God put off from thee the old man
with all his errors!' a cold sweat broke over my
brow; the tapers burnt pale; a confused noise filled
my ear; I stood before God, and in that awful presence,
I vowed to sever myself from the world, and
in the midst of life to be in death. The dreadful
comminations were then pronounced by the Bishop,
'Whoso breaketh his vow, vowed to God,
whether in act, or word, or thought, let him be
<i>Anathema Maranatha!</i> accursed for ever and ever;
he is guilty of the sin against the Holy Ghost, never,
never to be forgiven.'&mdash;The sacred music now once
more pealed through the roofs of the chapel an
anthem of joy on the victory achieved over human
infirmity, or human reason.</p>

<p>"The kindness of my brethren, and above all of
Father Jerome, soon awoke me from a trance in
which I scarcely seemed to breathe. The terrible
ideas that had filled my mind, and given me the
feeling of being buried alive, were necessarily short-lived,
as all exaggerations are; for they rested on
an imagination, on a metaphor; and I soon felt that
I was still in the world of living creatures, though
cut off from so much that makes it worth inhabiting.</p>

<p>"My hours glided smoothly and silently along

<!-- vol 1 page 71 -->

for some months after my reception. The novelty
of the duties I had now to perform, and the interest
I took in the affairs of the house, served to
excite me and to fill my mind; while the studies
which occupied my time made the day pass without
weariness. The society of the friars, with most
of whom I was well acquainted, and who were generally
well informed, and some of them sensible men,
was far from unpleasing; the abbot was uniformly
kind and condescending; and above all I enjoyed,
without restraint and in the fullest measure, that intercourse
with my beloved Father Jerome, which to
me was ever the greatest relish I was capable of
tasting. Far from becoming less the object of admiration
upon a close intimacy, like so may shining
men, especially men who call in the arts of the actor
to support their position, and set off their abilities
and acquirements, I might truly say that at a greater
distance I had not known his extraordinary endowments;
and that the angelic sweetness of his disposition
could only be appreciated by a long and a
constant intercourse, which proved how impossible it
was for anything to ruffle his temper. On his part
he cultivated my friendship more than ever, now
that we were brethren of the same order, and that

he no longer could excite jealousy by bestowing on
me any marks of his confidence and esteem. He
had no greater pleasure than to consult me upon
his literary pursuits, to show me his writings, to plan
with me other undertakings. Sometimes he would
discuss the State affairs which occasionally occupied
men's minds even in the remotest provinces,
when the loss of our North American colony, and
the defeat of our fleets, had given to the House of
Bourbon the first blow it received since the latter
days of Louis XIV. His far-seeing intellect, as it
pierced the walls of his cloister, penetrated also the
clouds which veil futurity from our eyes; and
much of the ferment now raging in different parts
of this country was foreseen by his perspicacity,
which could well compare the past with the present,
gleaning from the history of other times lessons of
wisdom applicable to our own. Inexperienced as
I was, and knowing men from books alone, upon his
sayings I hung as on the voice of an oracle, while he
delivered his opinions with a modesty only equalled
by their calmness and sound observation, and with a
suavity that I never have since known in another;
and explained difficulties with a clearness that
seemed to leave nothing unsolved.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 73 -->

<p>"Our reading and discussions were not confined
to science, or even to history; through the realms of
fancy we made frequent excursions; and from him
I imbibed the taste both for the poets of Italy and
of our own country, which has been one of the few
solaces of many weary, painful hours in less happy
times. Above all, he inculcated in me the duty of
appreciating the awful Florentine; bade me note
the manly energy, the self-denying conciseness of expression,
the scorn of yoking to his chariot a number
of epithets, like those who drive a substantive and
six adjectives, beside adverbs as outriders; the
confining of his efforts to careful selection of the
best expressions, and leaving all the rest out together;
the just and dignified confidence in the force
of a single phrase, and disdain of making his impression
by a repetition of little blows; qualities
which we in vain seek in any other modern, and
only find, perhaps, in two among the great masters
of ancient diction, Demosthenes and Lucretius. He
would then make me contrast Dante with the other
masters of song, and mark their invariable inferiority.
'See,' he was wont to say, 'this poet, not
satisfied with one metaphor, but he must give you
a cluster, as if a constellation would ever shine

<!-- vol 1 page 74 -->

bright like a planet; or that other, who, to describe
an object, makes a catalogue, an inventory of all its
parts, like an auctioneer or valuer, instead of seizing
on the bold and leading features, bringing them
out and casting the rest into the shade; while in
one respect they seem all to agree; and it is the
powerful contrast with the divine genius of Italy:
though they often do hit upon the right word, they
have in their search found so many others of some
value, that they must needs make a setting of these
round the jewel itself.'</p>

<p>"Once, I said when this critique was going on,
'Don't you rather show some lenity to them by
allowing they find a jewel and make a setting for
it?'&mdash;'Yes,' he said, 'indeed I do; rather they
resemble sempstresses, who having cut out a flower,
must needs gather up the parings and make a vile
patchwork round it. But</p>

<p>"When I would object to the plan and the epic
of the <i>Divina Commedia</i>, sometimes comparing it
with the Iliad, sometimes with the Odyssey (to
which merely superficial readers have found more
resemblance), he freely admitted its great defects;

<!-- vol 1 page 75 -->

confessing that story there is none, nor hardly
anything that can be called the action or the speaking
of persons in their proper character; and admitting
that an immeasurably inferior artist, Tasso,
has far more pretension to epic powers, and that
even Petrarch more successfully attains his object;
that, however, being only the very humble one of a
fine sonnetteer; a power showing inexhaustible fertility
of resource in ringing the changes numberless
times on two or three ideas. But of Dante, he
naturally lauded the wondrous power also of felicitous
imagination, not always restrained by severe
taste; the endless gallery of striking pictures
through which he leads us; the extraordinary learning
he displays; and the profound metaphysical
attributes, above all, of the Paradise. Nor can anything
be more perfect than both his descriptions of
nature with a blow, as in the doves (<i>con l'ale aperte
e ferme</i>); or of sentiment, as in the Pia; or of
moral feelings, as in the evening scene (<i>Era gi&agrave;
l'ora</i>); or of horrible emotions, as in the Ugolino;
or of both pain and pleasure combined, as in the
Maestro Adamo. However, he recurred to the marvellous
diction and the dignified self-restraint in its
use, as offering the most striking contrast with other,

<!-- vol 1 page 76 -->

and above all, with modern artists. He said, he
understood there was an English poet who, in many
passages, came near him: but he could only judge
by a literal translation. One description he had
seen impressed him with a very high notion of that
poet's power. It was a picture of death, exceedingly
sublime, and which, from first to last, raised in
the mind no image of a skeleton, as all others did
on the same subject, but left every thing vague,
shadowy, shrouded in unutterable horror. 'Such
things are,' he would say, 'worthy of Dante himself.
And yet I doubt if his picturesque genius
would have avoided the skeleton.' He would extend
his criticism, just though severe, even to our
masters, the ancients; few of whom he would allow
faultless. For example, Tacitus he could little endure;
though he would admit his merit of deep
observation, and even his peculiar and sometimes
expressive conciseness: as when he puts in two
words the idea given in four by Sallust (whom he
liked far less, and was prejudiced against for his
libel on Cicero), the one saying "alieni cupidus;
sui profusus;" the other saying "alieni prodigus."
But a style so unnatural, so studded with conceits,
often puerile, he little valued; and would, at times,

<!-- vol 1 page 77 -->

make merry by comparing it with what he called
the short-hand writer, Florus. Of all Latin prose,
he most relished Livy; the least trustworthy, however,
of historians: and of all Greek, Thucydides,
and the Halicarnassian; Polybius, of course, the
least, notwithstanding his honesty. But in Demosthenes
he found every merit; the finest declamation,
the most lucid statement, the most perfect
narrative, the most thundering appeals to reason
by sudden juxtaposition, graphic allusions to facts,
vivid exposure of inconsistency, marvellous comparisons,
and resemblances, and analogies (<i>rapprochemens</i>);
only, he denied that a sustained argumentation,
a logical train of reasoning, was to be
found in that first of masters, nor did he conceive
that the levity of an Athenian audience would have
borne it. How often has he built castles in the
air, and fancied us wandering in Attica: and after
rowing over the Ilyssus, 'going down,' like Plato,
'to the Pir&aelig;us,' visiting the glories of the Parthenon,
then placing ourselves on the steps of the Ecclesia, in
front of the Bema, and fancying that by the wonderful
formation of that building, we heard even at a distance
the voice of him who thundered over Greece,
wielded at will the fierce democracy, and made the

<!-- vol 1 page 78 -->

throne of the tyrant to shake. This, and the examination
of the Plain of Troy, often was the subject
of our waking dreams; not that, all full as he
was of admiration for Homer, he much fancied that
any traces of the poet's pictures could be found on
the ground, or in the ruins, or that he ever had professed
to describe real existence in one respect,
while in all others he was purely the maker of
fiction.</p>

<p>"But on no subject did he more love to descant,
and on none was he more interesting, than on one
which came close to his own sacred profession, the
great topic of Pulpit Eloquence. Here he was
peculiarly at home; and here Massillon, the great
Bishop of Clermont, was his Demosthenes; but also
he would compare him to Dante, for the power
which he has of finishing a topic with a blow. I
recollect his remarking how singular it is, that the
most celebrated passage in all this great preacher's
discourses, that of the Judgment, in the '<i>Petit nombre
des Elus</i>,' is imperfectly given in the book itself,
and only to be found correct in a place you would
the last search for it&mdash;Voltaire. He has preserved
this magnificent trophy of true eloquence; the ordinary
edition makes the preacher only say, 'Are you

<!-- vol 1 page 79 -->

sure half here present would then (were Christ
suddenly to appear as our Judge) be found among
the saved? Are you sure that ten would be found?'
But Voltaire's edition nobly adds, 'Would there a
single one be found?' ('<i>En trouveroit-il un seul?</i>')
It was upon this exclamation that the audience rose
up in horror and dismay. I asked if he considered
this as the finest passage in Massillon? He said
'No&mdash;The first four words of his funeral sermon
on Louis le Grand beat every thing; this is the
noblest, the most sublime, the most simple of all
the feats of eloquence. "God only is great, my
brethren"&mdash;("<i>Dieu seul est grand, mes freres</i>")
words which every people can receive, because
every tongue can render them alike. But it is
grievous to find the sentence not, as it should have
done, stop there. It goes on, "Et dans les derniers
momens, surtout, o&ugrave; il preside &agrave; la mort des Rois
de la terre."&mdash;The body of Louis then lying dead
before the people, surely, when the great preacher
stretched forth his hands, and with a voice as of one
sent from above to improve this solemn occasion,
proclaimed the King Eternal, Immortal, Invisible,
the only living God; surely, to add his presiding at
the death of kings, as if to evince his superiority,

<!-- vol 1 page 80 -->

was somewhat needless. It was like the addition
which Tasso makes to the noble simile of the lion
in Dante's Sordello: "A guisa di leon quando si
posa;" whereunto Tasso is pleased to subjoin,
in kind compassion to the reader, for fear he
should not comprehend the matter,</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Girando gli occhi e non movendo il passo."</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>'Surely,' added Father Jerome, 'Massillon must have
for the moment been transformed into Bossuet, to
make an addition which himself could no more
have made than Bossuet was capable of the sublime
opening.' I found Bossuet's unctuous style,
his sugar sweet (<i>doucereux</i>) sentences, his overdone
feeling, when he is <i>touched</i> with nothings, and calls
upon his hearers, but calls in vain, to be touched too,
was no great favourite of my acute friend, who,
however, exceedingly admired his justly celebrated
'<i>Discours</i>' (on Universal History) both for its
learning, its philosophy, and its composition.
Bourdaloue he revered as the father of pulpit
eloquence, and, contrary to common opinion, regarded
him as the model on which Massillon must,
after the ancient masters of speech, have formed
himself.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 81 -->

<p>"In these discussions and these day-dreams our
hours were passed, when not engaged in the duties
of the house, or in visiting the poor of the neighbourhood,
and ministering to their wants; a duty
which Father Jerome held the most sacred, and
from the discharge of which his compassionate
nature derived the purest gratification.</p>

<p>"Thus glided our monotonous and peaceful life.
Among the fraternity, there were few indeed whom
I did not esteem greatly; one only for whom I felt
any thing like aversion. Father Ambrose was of a
noble family, in high favour at Court; and through
that influence, and his own merits, which were of a
high order, he aspired to succeed the ancient abbot
now at our head&mdash;Father Jerome, who by universal
consent must have been their choice, having always
openly declared that nothing should induce him to
accept the abbacy. The faculties of Ambrose were
great: his learning extensive in the branch to which
with ambitious views he devoted himself,&mdash;theology
and the scholastic science generally. His spirit was
daring; his art profound; his resources inexhaustible.
Wholly unscrupulous in the choice of his
means; as wholly unbridled in the selection of his
purposes; of the deepest dissimulation; of the most

<!-- vol 1 page 82 -->

malignant soul when any one crossed his path; of
fiery passions, which nevertheless he kept in habitual
subjection to his strong will, and his firm purpose,&mdash;he
seemed to revive in the eighteenth century the
character of the priests who ruled the destinies of
the fifteenth; and to have all the genius and all
the ambition, which after raising the possessor of
the one, and victim of the other, to the head of a
monastery, could elevate him to the custody of the
keys, could encircle his head with the triple crown,
and make the 'servant of servants' a ruler over the
princes and potentates of the Western World. This
man had early conceived a jealousy of me, from
observing that I became a favourite with the
brethren, and also from perceiving that I did not
pay him court; for Father Jerome, the god of my
idolatry, had an unconquerable dislike to him,
grounded on his perfect distrust of so designing a
person, and his repugnance for one whom he knew
to be perfectly unamiable; and in this feeling I
easily became a sharer. Occasions frequently arose
to prove how little I esteemed him, and opportunities
were not wanting to show on his part a
return with ample interest of the same sentiments.
A trifling circumstance added to the aversion with

<!-- vol 1 page 83 -->

which I viewed him; he bore a likeness to Father
Jerome, so striking that I have over and over again,
on seeing him at the end of our arcades or lime
walks, hastened to meet him, and embrace him,
my heart overflowing with affection, when I suddenly
on approaching perceived by the sardonic
smile on his fine and expressive, but unamiable
countenance, that he both had divined my mistake,
and was sensible of the feelings which I experienced
on being undeceived. It was surmised by some,
and among others, even by the kind and charitable
Father Jerome, that Ambrose was not that one
of the brethren who kept his sensual propensities
under the most entire control; and rumours gained
credit of his impetuous nature having broken out
in the course of the charitable visits which he made
to objects of the monastery's benevolent care.</p>

<p>"We had another brother in our convent, whom I
did not much like, although certainly I had not the
same aversion for him as for Ambrose. But though
he was not wicked, and had great abilities, especially
a lively and entertaining fancy, yet I never could
either place any confidence in him, or take much
pleasure in his somewhat amusing society. He was
an Irishman by extraction, indeed by birth, having

<!-- vol 1 page 84 -->

come over to our convent when grown up to the
age of sixteen; he was called O'Halloran, of a
small gentleman's family, in middling circumstances,
though proud of tracing back their lineage to some
obscure and local barbarous chiefs, whom they were
pleased to call Ancient Kings of Ireland, and of
whom I do suppose there may have been scores at
a time. He was not a man who would deliberately
lie, or wilfully engage in a fraud; yet it was impossible
to place the least reliance on his account of
any person or any thing, partly because he suffered
his memory to be ever warped by his imagination,
now obscuring it, now creating materials for its
exercise, and partly too from a vile habit he had,
and which really seemed a second nature, of looking
in his narratives always to the effect they might
produce; so that he would paint a transaction or a
person in colours purely fantastic to give amusement
to the hearer, or he would mould his statements
so as precisely to suit the purpose of the moment
in furthering any object he had in view. Father
O'Halloran, or Pierre, as he was called, was well
natured, too, but more from a joyousness of spirit
and a warmth of temperament than from good disposition.
A very surprising part of his character,

<!-- vol 1 page 85 -->

or his temper, was the thin partition that divided
his mirth and good humour from his anger: he
never gave warning of a quarrel, partly from fear,
partly from good humour; and you found he had
passed the line and a rupture had taken place before
you had the least suspicion of it. So far he was amiable
that he loved to give pleasure and would go a
good deal out of his way and also out of the way of
truth rather than give pain. His spirits were exuberant,
and he pretty indiscriminately laughed and
made laugh with all. His nerves were very far
from being as stout as he affected: he would bravado
and bluster when there was little danger, and
he always knew exactly the person with whom he
could venture to behold and stout: he was anything
rather than a firm-minded man. He was abundantly
selfish too, always had an eye to his own interest;
and, though his volatile nature kept him
from very steadily pursuing it, and his habitual
imprudence made him often fail of success, his
defeat was never the result of indifference to the end,
or of any great scrupulousness about the means.
In his demeanour he was more than civil; he was
subservient and fawning, partly from good humour,
but partly too on calculation. His judgment was

<!-- vol 1 page 86 -->

bad, with all his acuteness; you could not trust his
decisions any more than his narratives. But after
all it was this latter quality that mainly created my
dislike for him and that of Father Jerome, who
hardly had more aversion for Father Ambrose himself.
He used to say that it appeared to him as if
O'Halloran did not know the difference between
truth and falsehood; as if some organ was wanting
in him which other men had; and he would give
this Irishman as an example of a remark he had
made very generally, that there are no people more
credulous of falsehood than those who themselves
deal little in truth; as if a secret consciousness that
they might have occasion for quarter from other
breakers of the great moral law induced them to
give help and credence to their neighbour in his need.
With this brother you will readily believe I cultivated
little acquaintance and no friendship. He had little
solid or accurate learning; a rubbish of history
and theology in his head, ill assorted and no wise
arranged; but no information that could help his
own views or win the confidence of others. Its sad
characteristic was want of accuracy in the groundwork,
of care in the superstructure, and of discretion
in the application. Thus, of all the teaching brethren,

<!-- vol 1 page 87 -->

he had the least success. Nothing could exceed the
confidence he shewed in the task of instruction he
undertook; nothing could exceed the pains he took
to gain his pupil's favour. But his scholars made
little or no progress, and he failed even to ensure,
with all his chase of popularity, as much favour
among them as others of harsh and distant, and
even severe, manners obtained. His pupils had
quite as little respect for him as his brethren."</p>

<p class="small">THE CONVERT.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Father Ambrose</span> and Father O'Halloran, such
as I have described them, formed really the only
exceptions of any importance to my esteem for the
brotherhood of St. Benedict. Many were inferior in
amiable qualities to Jerome; all were of very far
lower talents and accomplishments; and in the union
of a pure angelic character, both in sweetness of disposition
and sterling goodness of heart, with the
rarest faculties of the understanding, none could be
named as belonging to the same species. But
excepting Father O'Halloran, there were none for
whom I had a contempt, and excepting Ambrose,
none were positively hateful, and even his character
was not of a disagreeable, though it might be of a
vicious, cast.</p>

<p>"Time accordingly wore on smoothly in the
studies, the duties, and the occupations of the place.

<!-- vol 1 page 89 -->

But time also was working some change in the
temperament of a youth only just arrived at man's
estate, whose passions had been suppressed and
whose feelings had been trained by the rigour of the
monastic rule. Religion and its observances, even
the religion of the Romish Church, and even of the
regular clergy of that church, though impressive at
the first, and well fitted to fill the mind, was not of
power sufficient, especially when some time had
passed away, entirely to absorb its faculties and to
deaden all other feelings. A cloud of ignorance rather
than of mystery would sometimes spread over the
mind, and prevent it from clearly comprehending
what was taught and what was believed. A reluctance
would sometimes affect the mind, and weaning it
from sacred things, as these had formerly weaned
it from the world, would make the total abstraction
from the visible world hard, the entire absorption in
things unseen impossible. A doubt would sometimes
steal into the mind, and beget notions that
Providence which endowed men with faculties for
active, and feelings for social intercourse, never could
have designed any part of the species to vegetate
in absolute indolence, and to sheathe their hearts
against all the influences of the tender passions.

<!-- vol 1 page 90 -->

The struggles which thus arose within me, it would
be difficult to describe. A war was waged with the
awful sense of religious obligation which my solemn
vows had completed, my pious education having
begun it. Against that deep sense of duty were
leagued the strength of my understanding, the
passions of my frame, the feelings of my heart. In
this conflict it was vain to consult any one of my
brethren; even Father Jerome forbade the subject;
and though he wept as he marked the agony I was
enduring, with his accustomed delicacy he never
even reminded me of the warnings he had given,
and in spite of which I had persisted in embracing
the monastic life.</p>

<p>"A younger brother of the order, having discovered
by some chance remark the state of my
mind, was the first to break silence with me upon the
subject that now engaged all my waking thoughts,
and forbade me at night to taste repose. He had
entered the convent more in compliance with the
wishes of his family, who hoped thus to obtain for
him an abbacy, than from any opinions which he
had formed, or any religious impressions to which
he was subject. He was a fine young man, of noble
mien, good abilities, strong passions, warm feelings.

<!-- vol 1 page 91 -->

and no fixed principles; by no means profligate in
his notions, entirely void of guile, of an amiable disposition,
and much attached to me from similarity
of age, and from a likeness which he very erroneously
supposed to exist in the circumstances of our
situation. He had for some time begun to feel the
restraints of the order more than he could well
endure; and though he was fully aware that no
escape from them was possible, he yet was anxious
to open an unreserved communication with a fellow-sufferer,
as he supposed me to be, and he was not
very slow, or very nice, in finding an opportunity of
unveiling his heart to me. Though fond of his
society, which was amusing and agreeable, I at
once repressed all such confidence, and no further
disclosure was made to me, until the force of restrained
passion produced its usual effect, and my
comrade was soon stretched upon a bed of sickness,
to which he summoned me that I might minister to
his consolation. When I had given him such advice
and such comfort as I could render, he gently
squeezed my hand, and declared to me that my
refusal to receive his confidence, and let him unburthen
his mind, had been the main cause of his
present severe indisposition. All further severity on

<!-- vol 1 page 92 -->

my part now became impossible; it would indeed
have been misplaced; and in the hope of ministering
to his relief, I listened to all his complaints against the
monastic rule&mdash;complaints which were one continued
and mournful echo to the feelings that had for some
time been secretly preying upon me, and seemed to
gnaw my very heart. Discussion of every subject
was the inevitable consequence; we partook of each
other's sentiments; we began to take up strange unlawful
opinions, to form strange unlawful wishes;
and this interesting youth's recovery being much
promoted by the relief which my society afforded
him, he once more assumed his place in our fraternity;
and our intimacy being perceived, was marked
by Father Ambrose. My friend became an object
of his especial suspicion and dislike, almost equally
with myself.</p>

<p>"Father Isidore (that was his name), though
not much older than myself, was much more practised
in the ways of the world; and he planned for
me, I verily believe with the purest wishes for my
good, a scheme by which he hoped to effect my
emancipation from the thraldom I still laboured
under. He introduced me to a cousin of his own,
whose health was feeble, whom he loved as a sister.

<!-- vol 1 page 93 -->

and who he believed would receive comfort from my
ministrations. I am quite certain that he had no
bad designs in this proceeding; and that, could he
have foreseen how far beyond the interest taken in a
penitent my attentions would go, he would at once
have put a stop to our intimacy. But long before
he could perceive this, long indeed before it was
known to myself, the most tender feelings of our
nature had been engaged, while I only imagined that
I was fulfilling a religious duty, and occupying agreeably
and with perfect innocence, a few spare hours of
my time. The virtue, as well as the accomplishments
of Mdlle. Louise Orange were unquestionable.
Her family was of the first respectability. She
was visited occasionally by Father Jerome, who
ministered to her, when unable to attend the convent
mass; and though he abstained from female
society, however agreeable, upon a principle of avoiding
temptation, he yet now and then saw her for
half an hour at a time, holding her to be one of the
most interesting and accomplished persons in Avignon.
She was a creature of bewitching manners, and of a
beauty far more attractive than the greatest regularity
of feature, or brilliancy of colouring, or grace of
form, can ever become; for her beauty was of the

<!-- vol 1 page 94 -->

understanding, and her expression was as varied as
powerful. It was almost impossible to see, and quite
impossible to hear her unmoved; and to be fascinated
was only to have a perception of what is most lovely
and most striking in woman. After struggling with
my feelings for weeks, after restless days and sleepless
nights, after hearing all Father Jerome's warnings,
enduring all Father Isidore's jibes, suffering all my
own reproaches, more terrible than any that could
come from without, I, at length, was compelled to
commune with myself, and confess to myself, that I
had become desperately enamoured of this matchless
person, and had all but broken my solemn vow
in thought&mdash;all but transgressed in my heart.</p>

<p>"Whence comes it to pass that things which at a
distance seem so formidable, instead of becoming still
more frightful as we approach near, are almost
divested of their terrors and cease to dismay? Is it
that we have conjured up ideas more terrific than the
reality? Is it that we have exhausted our stock of fear
and horror on the terrific prospect, on the fancied evil,
so as to have none left for the thing itself? Or, is
it that the mind is still under the influence of the
feelings which have betrayed it, and views through
the medium of those feelings the peril they have

<!-- vol 1 page 95 -->

made us encounter&mdash;the mischief they have drawn
down upon our heads?&mdash;I know not; but of this I
am sure, that I had no sooner made to myself the
confession of my fall from grace, than I felt as if a
weight was removed from my heart, and as if my
emancipation was finally effected. It is true, that
had I instantly resorted to Father Jerome, he
would at once have opened my eyes to the risks of
my position, to the destruction which yawned on all
sides of me. One interview with him, one sentence
of his firm but sweet voice, one embrace, folding me
to his affectionate heart; and all the fascination of
Louise would have become powerless, all my own
weakness in yielding to it would have been revealed,
and my disease would at once have been cured. But
alas! it was part of that weakness, of that disease,
to prevent me from approaching the subject with my
most loved and revered friend. I carefully avoided
every thing which led to it. Father Jerome stood
aloof on the shore, ignorant of the struggle in which
I was plunged; and my destruction was completed,
before he knew that I had been assailed. It was
not so with Father Isidore; but he loved me so
tenderly, and shared so entirely in all my doubts
and difficulties, and himself felt so strongly all the

<!-- vol 1 page 96 -->

influences under which I was falling, that anything
rather than remonstrance was to be expected from
him.</p>

<p>"The giddy, intoxicated state of my mind for
some time chased away all the ideas that would
naturally have haunted me. I ventured not, indeed,
to whisper love in the ear of her whose slave I had
become; yet I saw the delight she took in my
society, and I gradually accustomed her to hear
from my lips expressions of interest in her lot, nay
vows of tender friendship, which a little reflection
would have shown to be utterly irreconcileable with
the vows I had made to heaven. Possibly my
friendship for her kinsman, who lived with her
family as a brother, tended to blind her, and prevent
her from perceiving how full of hazard was the
situation she approached, until she had actually got
entangled in all its inextricable difficulties. An
accidental circumstance, the reading together of a
poem in which both took deep interest, at once removed
the veil from her eyes&mdash;she heard me declare
that could she but love me, my whole soul was
devoted to her&mdash;she trembled from head to foot&mdash;she
fell down on the book now closed&mdash;with a deep
sigh she exclaimed 'Oh, God! Oh, God! I love

<!-- vol 1 page 97 -->

you too well!'&mdash;and I became at once the most delighted
and the most wretched of mortals!</p>

<p>"Whoever has long sighed in secret for the heart
of a lovely being, to whom he never durst disclose
the hidden flame that was smouldering under a cold
exterior, and consuming him night and day, will
comprehend the terror with which I ventured to
disclose my secret, and the anxiety with which I
stifled my breath during the interval of a moment
that seemed an age between that avowal and her
answer. Whoever has heard the sweetest of all
music that can reach the impatient and greedy ear,
will comprehend the state of ecstasy in which the
artless expression of fervent passion that burst from
her, as if she had felt my delay had been too long
to tell the secret in which she took so deep an
interest. But ours, alas, was not an innocent love.
In me it was apostacy, it was perjury, it was flying
in the face of that Divine Being, who had in his
own awful person witnessed the vows voluntarily and
deliberately made, vows to fly in the face of that
nature which the same Being had created, to outrage
all the strongest feelings which he had graciously
implanted in the heart. If such rebellion
was a crime in me, she who knew of my allegiance

<!-- vol 1 page 98 -->

became my accomplice and shared my guilt. But
all this was not felt at first. We were for the moment
plunged in a trance of delight, and each only
knew that the other and none else existed in the
world.</p>

<p>"The rapture of this short interview, however,
was succeeded, and quickly succeeded, by the
fears and the pangs appropriate to our several
situations. I can speak of myself only; and I immediately
was, like our first parents after their fall,
conscious of my nakedness, convinced that other
eyes than mine saw it, above all that it was glared
upon by the all-seeing eye and by the delegated
vigilance of His appointed ministers. I durst not pray
that day! I durst not enter the chapel where I had
knelt to make my vow, now shivered to atoms;
The bell tolled for mass; I durst not attend! The
bare idea of again seeing the Host elevated, and
standing once more in the presence against which I
had revolted filled me with unutterable dismay.
Adding falsehood to my other sins, I feigned sickness,
and remained in my cell. Nor durst I next
day see Father Jerome, who I could not help thinking
must perceive the dreadful change which a day
had wrought in me. But not only he, every one

<!-- vol 1 page 99 -->

that passed seemed to be regarding me with suspicion,
some with horror, and Father Ambrose with
the exultation of a fiend-like nature gratified by my
fall. Father Isidore alone seemed to remain with
whom I feared not to converse, and in him I found
all the consolation of which my situation was susceptible.
He even rejoiced in the change that
had come over me. His own mind was now pretty
well made up that monastic vows are unlawful in
the sight of God, and his scepticism had extended
much further than he cared, or perhaps dared, to let
me know. For the present he was satisfied with
raising sundry doubts in my mind, open to receive
them by the bias which a powerful interest gave to
find them well founded; and, proceeding upon the
principle that men easily believe what they wish to
be true, he kept by me during my state of distraction
without ceasing to comfort and to seduce me, and
helped me to avoid Father Jerome, whose eye, mild
but piercing, I durst not meet. It was thus that a
person of very inferior intellectual powers to my own,
and of attainments much less ample, obtained an
easy ascendancy over me, aided as his assaults were
by the enemy within, ready to fling open the gates
and make the garrison surrender.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 100 -->

<p>"By degrees my mind became tolerably calm.
Father Jerome frequently walked with me. The
first time I met him was in the dusk, when I could
escape his eye; and his manner, kinder than ever,
in consequence of my supposed illness, put to flight
the notion that he was aware of my state. Our intercourse
was renewed, and I even ventured to hope
that I might one day prevail upon him to discuss
some of Isidore's doctrines, though I secretly felt a
fear of beginning the conversation, not so much lest
he should forbid the subject, as lest he should put to
the rout the sophisms on which I feared, perhaps felt,
I had been feeding. But that which most relieved
me, and best soothed my distracted mind, though
it all the while added fresh fuel to the fire that kept
devouring me, was the intercourse which I continued
to have with her whom I now dared to call my
Louise. Isidore lent himself to this intercourse, from
which with the impetuosity of his age and his nature
he hoped to discover the means of accomplishing his
favourite purpose, our escaping from the monastery,
abandoning our faith as well as our profession, and
quitting for ever a country which, after such an
enormity, we no longer could be suffered to inhabit.
With me he had as yet confined his disputations to

<!-- vol 1 page 101 -->

questioning the lawfulness of vows by persons of
either sex, and consequently the whole monastic system.
But it was easy to see that this led necessarily
to a general investigation of the grounds of our
Catholic persuasion; and the terror I lived under
at having made a vow to the Deity which I was
prepared to break, easily opened my mind to those
irresistible arguments by which it is shown to
absolute demonstration that we have much better
proofs, and of the self-same kind, against the transmutation
of the sacramental elements, namely the
evidence of our senses, than we have of the Saviour
having left a record of his authority for daily performing
this miracle. He had easily made me a
convert to the position that the church never could
be right in making Marriage one of its sacraments,
and yet excluding from partaking in it the
whole body of its ministers, while it only gave half
the other and holier sacrament to the lay people.
He now presented to my mind the argument of
the Protestants against the Real Presence; and it
seemed to have a force yet more irresistible. The
road to conviction and conversion was in both instances
smoothed by my interests and my feelings.
The one doctrine allayed my greatest apprehensions.

<!-- vol 1 page 102 -->

the other gratified my strongest feelings. Fear
secured the triumph of the one argument, love that
of the other.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile my nature, fiery and impetuous, was
reasserting its rights, so long withheld; my passions
and my feelings, so long kept under control, were
gaining at length free scope; and the former restraint
only served to make them more ungovernable.
The first penalty which they made me pay
was the torment of jealousy, which I was now fated
to endure in a measure proportioned to the strength
of the attachment I cherished. The most perfect
affection for Louise, and her undeviating kindness to
me, did not secure me against a whisper that often
filled my inward ear. I knew she had erred, nay
sinned, by becoming the accomplice of my broken
vows; and she who had gone astray with one, might
she not yield also to another? The hated form of
Ambrose now rose before my eyes; for he had frequented
her society before I knew her; and a more
formidable rival no one could have to dread. His
winning address, peculiarly formed to captivate the
female heart; his graceful form and polished manners;
his great talents and solid acquirements; above
all his wit, the most fascinating I had ever known; all

<!-- vol 1 page 103 -->

gave a power to his designing mind and most wily
disposition, which, as it rendered escape from his
toils difficult, for a victim, made suspicion of his
rivalry natural and hardly to be avoided. Hitherto
I had little known what the power of jealousy was;
but that little I had owed to him. He had laid
siege with success to Isidore, and at one time both
estranged him from my society, and obtained an
ascendant over him, which only ceased upon the
discovery of some subtle artifice he had been employing
to circumvent us both. I did not, however,
soon forget this passage; and it filled me with suspicions
of his designs upon Louise. I saw that his
conversation not only amused but interested her.
Full of love for me, she yet saw far more of him
than I could reconcile with that attachment, very
much more than I could easily bear. His was
not the passion comparatively innocent with which I
was filled, and which pointed for its only gratification
to the sacrifice of all worldly ambition, and the
living for love alone. He had no views but those
of the order he belonged to, and hoped to rise in;
his plans, and I never doubted for an instant that
he had formed them, must lead to the ruin of her

<!-- vol 1 page 104 -->

I adored, and consummate my misery with her
destruction.</p>

<p>"After suffering unspeakable torments in the
struggle, and making vain efforts to overcome the
suspicions which preyed on me, nay, which, added
to the other miseries of my situation, often made me
feel life itself a burden I would fain have shaken
off, never having ventured to converse with Isidore
on the subject from the pride which always enters
so largely into the feeling of jealousy, I at length
resolved to make Louise herself my confidant, because
I could feel no humiliation in confessing my
weakness to her. Nothing could be more kind than
her demeanour; nothing more gentle than the rebuke
which she felt she had a right to give me, for
what she described as a groundless fancy, and described
it with perfect frankness, and a manner so
wholly unembarrassed as at once laid all my suspicions
asleep. She even promised to give up all
intercourse with Father Ambrose, at least never to
see him but in my presence, or that of Isidore; and
as the hours at which alone we could ever see her
were known, there could be no difficulty in completing
this satisfactory arrangement. For some

<!-- vol 1 page 105 -->

weeks I perceived the wily and persevering monk
repeatedly leaving the door of the house her family
lived in, having been refused admittance because
she was alone.</p>

<p>"One day I found her reading some verses which
he had sent her, his own composition, and set by
him to music, which she was preparing to practise.
There was some humour in the remark I made on
it, asking her if she intended to allow his accompaniments
when she had learnt the air. There was a
proportionate humour in the reply which this drew
from her. 'She did not know but she might; he
was the only one of her friends and familiars who
played, and his guitar was admirable.' Never had
I so perfectly hated him as when he was thus classed
with me among her familiars (<i>habitu&eacute;s</i>). Never had
I felt so little satisfied with her.</p>

<p>"I soon made some excuse for leaving her, and
was strangely agitated when I found she made no
attempt to soothe, or even to chide me, for an anger
which she must have seen her remark had engendered,
and that she suffered me to depart after a
visit as short as it was every way unsatisfactory. I
walked about in a state alternately melancholy and
irritable, until the time had arrived for my return to

<!-- vol 1 page 106 -->

the evening lessons of the convent pupils, and after
that hour it was next to impossible that either myself
or Isidore, or any of the younger brethren, should be
seen without the walls of the garden.</p>

<p>"About eight o'clock, the evening was fine and
still; the season was autumn; the day I am little
likely to forget. As I was walking with Isidore I
perceived Father Ambrose leaving the evergreen-walk
that leads from the cypress garden through the
small Gothic back porch, surrounded with flowers,
and facing the part of the town where Louise's mother
lived. An involuntary shudder came over me
as I observed his guitar under his cloak. But I
continued the walk, and mastered my feelings sufficiently
to give an indifferent answer when Isidore
asked if I was unwell. A few turns more brought
us to his cell, and I hastened through the Gothic
porch. I remember stopping to pluck an autumnal
flower, which grew in peaceful solitude near the
wicket; and though void of fragrance pleased the
eye, and seemed to calm for an instant the ruffled
surface of my soul. The flower was pansy; I have
before my eyes its round form and violet leaf, with
light yellow margin and two small specks. I never
see that flower without a bitter pang. I went toward

<!-- vol 1 page 107 -->

the gate, and stumbled on a cross which the
wind had the night before blown down: it lay
against a small bench, and I nearly fell over it. At
the moment I thought I heard distant thunder, but
was not certain. A human bone lay close by the
upright limb of the cross; I recognised one of the
two which our superior had over his bookcase under
a skull; he would sometimes carry them with him
while taking his evening walk, and I have before
known him to drop one. At any other time I might
not have marked it. As I opened the wicket I
heard a raven scream hoarsely. After passing
through, I met one of our acolytes near the gate
retiring to the convent; and, in accents that were
nearly choked, I asked if he had seen Father Isidore,
not daring to name the other. He said he
had only seen Father Ambrose going into the
Countess's house. I made but one step across the
Place, now nearly deserted, and sprang to the gate
of the Countess's house, which I found standing
ajar. The apartment of Louise was reached by a
narrow and somewhat lofty stair with a rail, and
ending in the passage, along which a rope was
drawn, the continuation of the rail being under
repair. I mounted the steps in breathless agony.

<!-- vol 1 page 108 -->

As I approached the door of her chamber, I heard
the last bars of an air which she was singing, or
rather had just sung; I then heard two voices for a
minute or two; I could distinguish no words; I
could only be sure that both parties spoke; however,
it seemed to my troubled brain, that these accents
were those of affection, if not of passion; a pause
ensued; and then I heard a step approaching the
door, but as it opened, I distinctly heard a kiss; and
forth stepped Ambrose. No longer master of myself
I sprang upon him, and dashed him through the
rope, down upon the ground.&mdash;Louise shrieked and
fell upon the floor.&mdash;I looked down into the hall
and saw that it was&mdash;Father <i>Jerome</i> whom I had
slain!"</p>

<p>"Gracious God!" exclaimed the Count, "Father
Jerome!"&mdash;"Ah, well may you thus exclaim!"
resumed the Solitary. "Well may the recounted
horror thrill your frame! But mine it was to witness
it, and to have done it! In the desperate effort to
throw myself after my victim and terminate instantly
an intolerable existence, I sunk senseless upon the
passage floor. On recovering I found I was in
Louise's room, but she was gone, and Father Isidore
was tenderly watching over me.&mdash;I need not stop to

<!-- vol 1 page 109 -->

add what I afterwards learnt, that the song I had
heard was the Evening Hymn, the kiss was from
Louise's lips upon the good father's hand, which
had previously given her his most precious blessing.</p>

<p>"I must hasten over the dreadful sequel. My
memory is imperfect, for my mind was disturbed
for many weeks; and I have but the recollection of
one scene, which never can be erased from my brain.
The saint-like man survived about a day, after being
conveyed home by the Countess's people, who believed
he had accidentally fallen through the rope,
and I was taken by Isidore to witness his last moments,
or if I dared ask, or dared receive it, to
obtain his forgiveness and his blessing. Even of
the particulars attending this awful scene I have an
indistinct remembrance. The entry of the Host,
borne by the abbot himself, the solemn communication
of the Sacramental elements, the anointing,
the sprinkling, the bestowing of the <i>Viaticum</i>, I less
distinctly can call to mind. But the picture that
remains burnt into my soul, and which has never
been absent from my eyes, is the pious father laid
meekly on his lowly bed after all the necessary ceremony
of the Church had been performed, and the
look of unbroken mildness, of unabated affection

<!-- vol 1 page 110 -->

with which his eye beamed upon me as he saw me
kneel, unable to beg a blessing. That look, far,
far superior to merely betokening forgiveness of his
murderer, what would I give that it had been withheld!
How thankful should I have been to see
his countenance clothed in frowns, nay, distorted
with anger! His placid smile, his heavenly look
of love, his inward prayer for me piercing his exhausted
and scarcely living features, made the torment
I endured ten thousand times more acute;
nor was it till long after this dreadful hour that I
could have calmness enough to reflect on the most
edifying sight which all had witnessed, and of which
I alone had not been sensible at the time, the passage
into endless bliss of one whose whole life had
been one of innocence, of kindness, of devotion;
whose latter end was peace, and an example indeed,
but far above that of those who, acting a part, would
teach us how a Christian can die; for in him this
scene was nature; and he had been created an angel
before he was made a Christian."</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="small">THE OUTLAW.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The</span> effect of the death-bed scene in awakening
me and collecting my faculties was but transient;
soon I relapsed into a state of mind which prevents
the pursuing of any reasoning, or the formation of
any fixed purpose, or indeed the correct perception
of what is going on around us, and easily confounds
with realities, the creations of the bewildered brain.
I enjoyed nothing, took an interest in nothing, but
suffered nothing. I felt as strange to myself, and
wholly indifferent to everything around me. The
society of the brethren I could little bear; but this
was from the exertion it required to answer questions,
and sometimes from the acute pain they gave
me by the mention of Father Jerome, the only
living sensation to which I was subject&mdash;all other
feelings were blunted in an extraordinary degree.
I could even endure the hated presence and voice of

<!-- vol 1 page 112 -->

Ambrose, and though the watchful attention of
Isidore was felt, and possibly had some tendency to
soothe me, I cared little for it. The feelings of the
soul, like the nerves of the body, are liable to a
paralytic numbness; and as we sometimes partially
lose the use of the latter, so do the former also
lose their acuteness. I had lost the taste of both
the bitters and the sweets which the society of
my brethren afforded. But this was not all; the
enchanting voice of Louise herself fell flat upon my
ear, and I took no pleasure whatever in her kind
affectionate care to wean my mind from its apathy
by touching those chords which she was formerly
wont so easily to strike and make harmonious with
her own accents. Fits of mere stupor, too, would
succeed to my wanderings, and possibly these were
graciously given to prevent a more complete distraction;
for they generally succeeded any allusion
to the calamity, as it was thought, which had befallen
me.</p>

<p>"How long a time I passed in this dreadful state I
know not; except that the opening year was somewhat
advanced when I slowly began to recover. The
restoration of my mental health was attended with
extreme suffering from a degree of irritation which

<!-- vol 1 page 113 -->

I had never experienced, and which contrasted
mightily with the comparatively passive and insensible
state I had so long been in. That state I had
now ample reason to regret the loss of. I awoke to
an acuteness of feeling almost morbid, a recollection
of past scenes hardly possible to bear. Every step
in the monastery and the garden called up the most
lively images of past happiness, of the hours which
I had passed in innocence with my venerated guide,
the friend of my bosom. All his words, his lessons
of wisdom, his playful mirth, his rich fund of anecdotes
on the most important personages of past and
of present times, above everything the traits of his
pure benevolence to all, and of his unceasing kindness
to myself; these came perpetually into my
mind, and these never for one instant of time could
be dissevered from the manner of his death. I
stood before the eyes of the brethren as one to be
pitied for the affliction which had deprived him of
his dearest friend, his second father, whom he had
loved without the admixture of fear, at least of filial
respect, which places a distance between parent and
child when of the same sex; for between father and
daughter, son and mother, it exists not. In that
light I stood in the eyes of others, the object of

<!-- vol 1 page 114 -->

great compassion; in my own I stood as a criminal,
as one who, minded to perpetrate one murder,
had committed another, and been punished here,
and would be hereafter, having sacrificed his dearest
friend to his infernal lust of revenge, roused within
him by another passion, which he had vowed before
God never to know.</p>

<p>"This terrible thought soon became the one ever
uppermost in my mind; but gradually another
arose within me more unbearable still. I was as
yet wholly unsuspected both of Father Jerome's
death, and of an attachment for Louise, which
would have given far more scandal to the brethren,
than the greater sin that had followed from it. How
long might it be before the horrid truth was discovered?
How could I ever be sure that a secret
known to at least two persons beside myself, would
be kept? If I had no fears of Louise, was it certain
that Isidore, with his fiery nature and loose
principles, would never form an attachment and reveal
the mystery, in the course of those endearments
in which lovers ever seek excitement from
adventitious circumstances, and are even consoled
for the calamities that befal themselves by having
a pathetic or a striking communication which

<!-- vol 1 page 115 -->

offers an occasion to work on each other's sentiments,
and indulge in the luxury of feeling together?
But could I even be quite sure that the awful fact
was not in possession of others as well as ourselves,
those who might not at any time be trusted? Had
no servant of the house heard the short struggle
preceding the fall? Had no suspicion arisen in
other minds than Father Ernest's, the lawyer of the
convent, who, on seeing the rope torn down, observed
that it was driven away on one side, and marked
that the place where the father lay was not quite
directly under the edge of the passage? Nor
was it perfectly certain that Louise's maid, who
was in the adjoining room, and had seen me
ascend the steps, though she closed the door of her
apartment, had not opened it when she found that I
stood near the chamber for some minutes without
entering, as usually I did, immediately upon
coming up? All these things were most harassing
to my mind, already both enfeebled by disease, and
rendered more irritable and anxious than formerly;
but it must be admitted that some of these considerations
were sufficiently founded in reason to
bring alarm over a more firm and healthy intellect
than mine. Nor was it any relief to my apprehensions

<!-- vol 1 page 116 -->

that Father Ambrose was confessor to the
Countess Orange's family, and was consequently sure
to be first in possession of whatever was known by
any of them on so grave a subject as the death
of a leading Benedictine.</p>

<p>"Such were the terrors that filled me, and, far
from becoming less distracting by being long felt,
they gathered strength each time they haunted me
according to the rule of our nature by which fear
long felt, from weakening the texture of the mind,
acquires increased power over its functions, and filling
the imagination, gains perpetually new associates
to aid its operation. At first anything unusual
excited my apprehensions of a discovery. Any
unusual excitement among the brotherhood, any proceeding
out of the common course taken by the
abbot, any strange person appearing to demand an
audience, any unexpected messenger arriving at the
convent, all became the source of alarm, and all
were connected with my horrible mystery. But presently
it went further. It soon came to pass that I
could hardly separate the most ordinary and indifferent
matters from the idea that constantly pursued
me, by day and by night, studying or walking,
praying (if ever I ventured to pray), or musing;

<!-- vol 1 page 117 -->

the one idea that haunted my waking hours and
cast its shadow over my dreams, I could not see
one of the brethren look at me as I passed without a
fancy that he eyed me narrowly, and knew or suspected
something. If an acolyte, or a verger, or a
novice, gazed on me, possibly a little more earnestly
from the prevailing notion that my mind had been
affected by my loss, I straightway imagined that
they had heard some whispers in the society of the
town. If the superior gave me his blessing with more
than ordinary unction, from my distressed state, I
set it down as a proof that he had penetrated my
secret and felt how much I stood in need of his
prayers. I could not meet Father Ambrose's eye,
glaring as it was formerly wont to be with hatred,
now seeming calm with conscious superiority, though
incapable of compassion; I always felt that he bore
me more patiently than heretofore, because he knew
me to be humbled by my guilt. He only felt that
my protector was gone. I believed he knew the
terrible secret of his going. I never saw two of the
brothers in conversation but I took it for granted
that I formed the subject of their talk. Nothing
could have appeased my fears but the gratification
of my restless curiosity to know all that

<!-- vol 1 page 118 -->

all the house were saying, and, if possible, all that
each was thinking, in order to make sure that they
spoke not nor even thought of me. I could have
prayed for omnipresence and omniscience, that I
might know what all the people of Avignon were
always speaking about when any of them met, in
order to be certain that I or my secret did not form
the subject of their discourse. With all this I had
no resource in religion or its offices. I had remained,
from mental illness, incapable of the Holy
Sacrament; I continued to affect a partial indisposition
that I might avoid what I so much dreaded,
the standing once more before the Maker, the
Searcher of hearts, of whose actual presence I still,
after all my debates with Isidore, relapsed into a
belief, though a waning, and shaken, and obscure
belief. Confession I durst not think of, and before
the season for it at Easter came, there happened an
event which compelled me to make up my mind,
according to Isidore's unceasing suggestions, and at
once to quit the order and the Church.</p>

<p>"The maid who attended Louise, and who had
for many years been an attached servant of the
house, fell dangerously ill. Her devotion to the
family had hitherto kept her strictly silent on what

<!-- vol 1 page 119 -->

she knew and what she suspected. Even in confession
she had let nothing escape which could be a
clue to the suspicions she more than entertained.
But this concealment, as it was a protection to herself
against disclosing what she was by her duty
bound to have made known in the proper quarter,
was thus a sin on her part against the duties of the
confessional; and this weight she had, though with
pain, taken upon her conscience, until now when her
latter end approached, she could no longer avoid disclosing
what lay so heavy on her departing soul. She
therefore sent for Father Ambrose, as I discovered
by accident when sitting with Louise, who sincerely
lamented the illness of her amiable serving-woman.
My first impression was to see the dying woman
before the father came to perform his office, but
Louise wisely intreated me to avoid this step, as we
had no reason whatever for believing she was aware
of the truth, and any questions or suggestions from
me would at once have converted into certainty
whatever suspicions she might entertain. For the
same reason Louise was afraid of conversing with
her on the state of her mind, or her past recollections;
added to which was the consideration that
Father Ambrose must have discovered that such

<!-- vol 1 page 120 -->

criminal advice had been given, and the jealousy of
the confessional being roused, the consequence might
have been a refusal to grant absolution, with the
further gratification of his spleen in throwing the responsibility
upon Louise herself, whom, for her late
repulsive demeanour towards him, he very heartily
disliked. Nothing remained, therefore, but awaiting
the event inactive, and as patient as one so deeply
interested in it could manage to be.</p>

<p>"Father Ambrose came; the visit was not long;
he called upon Louise as he departed; the flash of
his eye, and the exultation that reigned through his
countenance, at once proclaimed his belief that one or
both of us was in his power, and but for the absolute
secresy of the confessional would be trodden under
his feet, armed with the law. To know this sufficed
for our agony of alarm; but this was not all. He
had cunningly, but perhaps not unjustifiably, counselled
the penitent to communicate to the magistrate
her offence, such it undeniably was, of so long a concealment;
and the unhappy woman had also told
him, under no promise of secresy, that she saw
through the imperfectly shut door my arm suddenly
flung round, as after a great effort, and instantly
heard a heavy body strike the ground. In terror at

<!-- vol 1 page 121 -->

having witnessed such a thing she had retreated, and
remained in her room till summoned by her mistress,
who had taken refuge in it, and made her fetch Isidore
from the Countess Orange's, where he had happened
to be, in order that he might succour me, who had
swooned away and had been with difficulty dragged
into Louise's room by herself. The fall of Father
Jerome, with the certainty that my action could have
proceeded from no effort to save him, was quite conclusive
against me; and my avoiding the duty of
confession, my long delay to attend mass, my dreadfully
agitated state of spirits, seemed to fill up whatever
these circumstances left defective in the chain of
evidence against me. Isidore, being called to our
councils, saw the matter in this light; we at once
made up our minds that the time for flight had
arrived, and that we durst not remain one night
longer in Avignon. We left it for ever, and left
Louise with a faint hope of once more meeting her in
other days, a hope cherished like some feeble taper's
flame, and sheltered from each blast that assailed
me, kept tremblingly half-alive and ever on the
point of being extinguished, the only light to shed a
gleam on the dismal prospect that now seemed to
close in upon me from every side.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 122 -->

<p>"It never struck us, until we were some distance
from Avignon, and had proceeded along the banks
of the Rhone in the direction of Beaucaire, that our
habit was fatal, and at once must betray us. Accordingly
we got rid of the cloak and hat by throwing
them into a well, and we spent great part of the
little money Louise had been able to give us in
purchasing the brown jackets and trowsers of a
farmer and his servants, at whose house we took
shelter, saying we had been robbed of our clothes
while sleeping on the bank and half dressed after
bathing in the river. This farm was only two
leagues from Avignon; and, afraid of waiting till
the alarm should reach it, which was certain to
spread over the town as soon as day broke, we went
on our journey, and began seriously to consult on
our anxious prospects. The first idea that struck
us was the most painful of all. Clearly we must
separate, 'My dearest friend,' said Isidore, 'anything
rather than this. If I say that I hated the
rule and the brotherhood less than I have ever
loved you, I should speak without any exaggeration.
All my ideas of happiness from being emancipated,
all the castles I have built in the air, were
founded on the cherished prospect of passing my

<!-- vol 1 page 123 -->

life in your society and friendship; and when my
sanguine temperament would ever let me build
dungeons in these castles, my separation from you
formed their structure.'&mdash;'Alas, Isidore!' I replied,
'we dare not, at least for the present, indulge such
feelings. God knows that my state most requires
joyous and soothing company like yours. But consider,
for a moment, that the mere fact of two
persons being in company, and whose accent declares
them to come from the Cont&acirc;t<sup id="r007"><a href="#n007">7</a></sup>, carries suspicion,
if not proof, along with it; for the rumour
will be, of course, that two friars, charged with
murder, have escaped from the monastery.' 'How,
then, shall I ever struggle alone with my fate?'
said Isidore. 'I begin already to feel that I have
been rash, as I ever am, in following my inclination;
and that I never looked forward to probabilities
until these became events. I might well have
foreseen all the difficulties that now surround me,
and the greater part of which would have been
sure to meet me even had your catastrophe never
occurred.'&mdash;'Alas, Isidore!' I replied, 'how you

<!-- vol 1 page 124 -->

harrow up my feelings by that word! I have been
the means of involving you, as well as myself, in
calamity, and, what is far worse, in disgrace; for,
with your opinions, to have only quitted the order
would have been little; and it is through me that
you are involved in a suspicion that will ever attach
to you, the suspicion of being privy, if not aiding, to
a crime of the deepest dye.'&mdash;'Let not this idea
vex your mind,' said the generous youth. 'My
attachment for you, and my devoted admiration of
your superior nature, will never make me feel the
disgrace while I know I am free from the guilt.'&mdash;'What,
then, must my feelings be,' I rejoined, 'who
have both loads to struggle under, and the additional
pang of causing so great an aggravation of
your danger? But, unhappily, part we must! and
I will take the road across to Nismes, where a
clergyman serving in one of the temples,<sup id="r008"><a href="#n008">8</a></sup> and connected
with my family, will be ready to receive me,
and give me some assistance to further my escape.'</p>

<p>"Isidore could not avoid perceiving that our
separation was necessary for securing even a chance

<!-- vol 1 page 125 -->

of safety. His plan was soon formed with his accustomed
resolution, and pursued with his wonted
vigour. He intended to cross the country by Arles,
to Aix, and so to reach Marseilles, where he should
be safe in the crowd of a great city, until he could
procure employment on board a vessel for the Levant.
'The errors of Paganism,' he said, 'and the
more pure superstitions of the Mahometan, can
never much disturb one who has seen men assume
to make their followers believe their dogmas in
opposition to their own senses, pretend to create the
Deity whom they worship, and usurp his most eminent
attribute, that of granting pardon for sin.'
Only half converted from these views, I could not
resist an involuntary shudder at hearing the mysteries
I had so long been used to revere, thus treated
with scorn; but all other feelings were lost in the
affection with which I embraced the only friend whom
my guilty hand had left me in the world. He
took the road to Arles, and I, avoiding Beaucaire,
journeyed on towards Nismes.</p>

<p>"I was now left all alone; and, for the first time
in my life, I knew the feeling of solitude. My own
reflections were for a while absorbed in the separation
from Isidore, who had gained exceedingly on my

<!-- vol 1 page 126 -->

affection during some months, and whose existence
I had begun to regard as knit up with my own.
The severance of this tie gave me great pain; but
other and far more painful reflections swiftly succeeded
when my mind was left to prey upon itself.
The idea of Father Jerome was never absent; the
dreadful struggle on the staircase; the discovery of
my fatal mistake; the mild aspect of the dying
saint; his hopeless condition as he lay in his cell;
and last, and worst of all, that kind look, that look
of heavenly affection with which he had sought
to send peace into my distracted soul; these were
the recollections that haunted me, and kept me
from recurring to the only idea which could have
soothed my troubled spirits, the image of Louise;
for that deserted me;&mdash;and I durst not pray.</p>

<p>"But these feelings were only those that kept
me company while I was alone; one, still more
harassing, was joined to them, and tormented me
as soon as my solitude was broken. I came near
Courbefort, a small village, as twilight began to
gleam; and I hastened through it as if I were pursued,
without reflecting that the news of my flight
never could have reached the place, or, if it did, that
I was disguised from all inquiring eyes in my peasant's

<!-- vol 1 page 127 -->

brown garb. I hastened towards Nismes,
hardly knowing what I did; and when I arrived
there it was broad daylight. A patrol came near,
and I never doubted that his intention was to seize
me; but he passed me, and this reassured me. I
entered the town and met a priest. This sight fixed
me to the ground; I supposed he must have heard
all; and that my crime and my flight was the constant
topic of conversation among all churchmen, and
all friars, I could not for a moment doubt. But
again, I forgot the distance I had come, and the little
communication there is between heretical Nismes
and the orthodox Cont&acirc;t. I felt as if every eye
was glaring upon me, and every one I met was ready
to seize and deliver me to justice. In this dismay, I
entirely forgot the name of the reformed minister
whom I was in quest of; till seeing Rue de Gard
written up as the name of a street, I remembered
that it was Father Gardein I wanted, and I was
easily directed to his modest dwelling.</p>

<p>"When I asked for him, I was told that I must
wait, as the good man was going to morning prayers;
but if I chose, I might partake (the female servant
said) of the family worship. I entered the room in
which they were assembled, and I shall not soon forget

<!-- vol 1 page 128 -->

the deep impression made upon my mind by the
simplicity of the service, so entirely contrasted with the
grandeur and pomp to which I had been accustomed.
Surrounded by the servants of his house, the pastor,
first asking for the Divine assistance, read some
verses of Scripture in the vulgar tongue, and then
kneeling, offered up a prayer of his own, the fervour
of which affected me exceedingly. Then rising, he
seated himself in his chair, opened the Bible which
lay before him, and read a chapter of the New Testament,
upon which he delivered a few explanatory
observations, and from which he drew a lesson of
moral conduct. Another prayer succeeded, and then
a psalm, in which all present joined. This closed
the simple solemnity; and, all else leaving the room,
he remained to ask what was my business with him.
The disclosure of my name at once obtained his protection,
but I did not venture to explain the whole
cause of my flight from Avignon; I only said that I
had accompanied Isidore, who had the misfortune of
having accidentally occasioned a friar's death, and
had quitted the monastery in consequence; taking
me with him, who partook of his doubts touching
the lawfulness of conventual vows. The pastor was
visibly alarmed by my recital, foreseeing the risk to

<!-- vol 1 page 129 -->

which he must be exposed from harbouring any one
at all mixed up in such a transaction; and still more
(considering his cloth barely tolerated in France)
from harbouring a monk who had thrown off the
garb of his order, violating one, at least, of his three
vows, that of obedience. In the state of violence to
which controversy then proceeded at Nismes, where
the community was split into factions and sects
mutually abhorring each other for Christ's sake,
and living in daily breach of the Gospel law of
charity, to show their zeal for that Gospel, it was
undeniable that he encountered no little hazard by
any shelter which he might lend me. His own
gentle and peaceful nature, too, bore some repugnance
to the contact of one ever so remotely, ever so
innocently, mixed with deeds of blood. The friendship,
however, which he bore our family, and the
destitute condition in which he saw me, overcame
all other feelings; and he at once introduced me to
his wife, his daughter, and his grand-children.
Yes, to his wife and children! This was a strange
sight to me; I could hardly recover from my surprise
at seeing a priest actually married, and father
of a family, and served in the house by only females.
It was something so repugnant to all I had

<!-- vol 1 page 130 -->

ever before witnessed, and all the ideas I had ever
formed of the sacred calling, that I seemed to be
cast into a foreign land, or rather into a new and
untried state of existence.</p>

<p>"The dreadful situation in which I now was
placed received a new embarrassment, from the
necessity under which I felt that I lay, sooner or
later, to exonerate my dear Isidore from the blame
I had been compelled to lay upon him, that I might
not be driven forth by the good pastor in his first
sensation of horror at seeing, for the first time in his
life, blood-stained hands supplicating his protection.
But after all, the prevailing alarm under which I
suffered, was the hourly terror of being discovered.
It was not long before the whole community was
occupied with the news which came from Avignon:
of course with great exaggerations. Two friars
were said to have escaped after murdering and
robbing the abbot; it was added, that they had
quarrelled about the division of the spoil, and one
was supposed to have killed the other, from the
circumstance of a hat and garment being found
in a well, on the road to Beaucaire. The police of
Nismes were as much on the alert as the society;
for it appeared that one, at least, of the fugitives

<!-- vol 1 page 131 -->

had been traced to Beaucaire; and some one had
seen a strange-looking peasant passing very early in
the morning of the day after the murder.</p>

<p>"In the controversial state of Nismes, this dreadful
affair gave rise to opposite views of the great
question on which parties were divided. The reformed
sect did not fail to draw from it an argument
against monastic institutions; their tendency to produce
an artificial and unnatural state of mind; the
effect of their rigid observances, to make men's
natural feelings revolt against their vows; the consequences
of broken vows in leading to the breach of
other and more sacred duties. The established clergy,
on the other hand, ascribed the crime that had been
committed to the relaxed state of discipline, arising
from toleration to Protestants; the free-thinking
opinions propagated by the reformers; their proselyting
practices, which had manifestly beguiled two
sheep from the fold of the Lord. The more strict,
particularly the Regular Clergy, scrupled not to see
in the event the hand of Providence, which dealt out
this judgment against the abbot for his extreme
spirit of toleration (confounding the abbot with the
good and dear Father Jerome). It was significantly
whispered, that the lenity of the age in this great

<!-- vol 1 page 132 -->

particular, would lead to a belief that the edict of
Nantes had never been revoked: and Nismes, the
centre of Protestantism, was plainly said to be, by
its neighbourhood, the cause of what had befallen
the orthodox Cont&acirc;t. Meanwhile, all anxiously
desired the discovery of the culprits; the one party
to release itself from all suspicion by showing, as
they expected, that Catholic hands alone had been
concerned in the deed; the other to extort, as they
hoped they should, confessions that the lessons of
the reformers had first seduced the criminals from
their duty. The police, on its part, was unceasing
in its active efforts to obtain the wished-for discovery.</p>

<p>"It would not be easy to convey any idea of the
agony I was doomed to undergo, while these things
were going on. It seemed as if the world's accustomed
fickleness and aptitude to be soon tired
of one subject of excitement had undergone a change;
for, day after day, the same topic occupied all men's
minds. This was partly owing to the new matter
that every day brought forward to help the search.
One man having been found to possess a friar's
frock marked with the name of F. Isidore, he was
immediately seized; and narrowly escaped being

<!-- vol 1 page 133 -->

brought to trial by showing that he had bought it
of a boy, who had found it under a hedge. At
length the farmer near the Rhone who had sold us
the brown dress was so alarmed by the accident,
and the general hue and cry, that he went to the
magistrate, and related the whole story. No doubt
could now remain that the criminals had escaped
in this disguise. One was traced to St. Canaut on
the road to Aix, but the scent was lost in that town;
he plainly came alone, and plainly was a stranger
from his tongue, and a fugitive, from his inquiring
the road to Marseilles. The other, therefore, must
have left him at Beaucaire; and as no one could be
traced to Arles, and the Courbefort peasant had
seen a man pass at a suspicious hour, it was at once
concluded that he must have come to Nismes.
Happily the man who directed me to the pastor's
house was not examined, possibly had forgotten
the circumstance, because it was the morning of a
feast day, when the streets are crowded. Yet as the
offender was concluded to be in Nismes, the activity
of the police was redoubled to detect him; and a person
answering the description given from Beaucaire
and Courbefort, and who had fled upon being
questioned, probably only to avoid being detained

<!-- vol 1 page 134 -->

and troubled, was arrested and brought before the
magistrate. Unfortunately for him, he proved by
his dialect to be from Avignon, and he had pretended
to be a Nismes man. A purse of silver was
found in his girdle, when searched, though he had
said a livre piece was all he possessed. He had a
rosary and crucifix in his pocket, of a far better
kind than peasants ever wear, and could only
account for this by saying he had found it; and he
had the folly, when irritated by the searching questions
of the magistrate, to speak disrespectfully of
the beads as having done him more harm than they
could ever after do him good.</p>

<p>"A scene of general self-glorification was now
performed, with abundant self-satisfaction to all
the actors. Each person praised some others as a
covert method of conveying self-laudation, by pointing
towards himself the public attention. The
police were duly inflated with the glory of their
successful investigations, and modestly gave the
credit of it to wise arrangements of their chief;
that chief affirmed that Lieutenant Sartine<sup id="r009"><a href="#n009">9</a></sup> himself
had never abler officers than he was happy to

<!-- vol 1 page 135 -->

have under him; the magistrate complacently said
from the bench, that Nismes could vie with any
one city in its admirable administration of justice;
a generous panegyric was pronounced upon the
beautiful jurisprudence of France in general, 'a
country happy above all others, in the accurate
but humane administration of Criminal Justice,
whereby the escape of the guilty was effectually
prevented, and the innocent were thus from all
suspicion effectually secured;' and the crowning proof
of this position (which was applauded by all the
audience) was forthwith given by condemning the
wretched man to the torture, as the only step in
the process now wanting to supply all the defects
of the proof against him. Furthermore, the exquisite
justice of the same law required that the question
extraordinary, as well as ordinary, should be
applied in this case, because it was one of sacrilege;
thus presuming the party guilty, and dealing with
him as such in the very act of ascertaining whether
he was not innocent of the charge.</p>

<p>"The horror into which I was thrown when the
account reached me, that on the next morning this
unhappy man was to have his joints stretched, and
his limbs broken, to make him confess a crime of

<!-- vol 1 page 136 -->

which I knew that he was guiltless, cannot easily be
imagined. I thought I heard his shrieks while
undergoing the dreadful operation; and I saw him
led away to execution for words that he might drop
under the agony of his torments. In this state I
threw myself on my knees before the good pastor,
and besought him to go before the magistrate, with
an asseveration to which his spotless character would
give weight, that he knew the man was innocent;
but this he could only know by also being aware
of the guilty person. That he had obtained any
knowledge from confession he could not say,
because the Protestants have no such exercise. If
a Catholic priest had been called in, he was
absolutely debarred from making any communication
to the magistrate, and must patiently see an
innocent man suffer death rather than violate, even
by negative assertion, the strict secresy of the confessional.
In this grievous dilemma, in which I
felt prepared to rush on my own destruction rather
than see innocent blood spilt for my offence, it
occurred to the pastor that the governor of the
place, a man of extraordinary honour and good
sense, as well as great humanity, might be entrusted
with the secret, only in part as yet revealed

<!-- vol 1 page 137 -->

to himself. I easily assented. To what would I
not have agreed to escape the horrors of a second,
and now a deliberate murder! General Talmont
was accordingly seen, and implored to interpose his
authority with the magistrate, and prevail upon
him at least to suspend the Question, until he could
communicate the particulars to the Government at
Paris. The worthy officer nobly agreed to act, and
disdained to consider the inevitable consequences of
his conduct, that of being charged with screening
an offender, for whose detection at all hazards the
public, including the contending sects, all alike were
eager. The Question was postponed for a fortnight;
but in the meanwhile the prisoner found means to
elude the vigilance of the most perfect of all police
establishments, the able chief who had equalled
himself to Lieut. Sartine, his much lauded officers,
and contrived to prevent the most dignified and acute
of magistrates from administering in his case the most
admirable of all systems of criminal jurisprudence;
in fact he had withdrawn from the custody of the
officers, the superintendence of the jail, and the
blessings of a law as humane as it was accurate,
preferring the more certain blessings of freedom
from all process, to those of being subject to any.

<!-- vol 1 page 138 -->

In a word he had, to my unspeakable relief, made his
escape. It is very likely from all the circumstances
that he was an old offender, probably come from
Marseilles to maraud at the Candlemas fair of
Nismes. Certain it is that he appeared no more
in that quarter.</p>

<p>"The indignation of the police now reached a
pitch of fury, and nothing could satisfy them but a
general domiciliary visit; to which in the prevailing
ferment a consent was obtained from the governor,
to whose interposition the man's escape was not
unnaturally ascribed. The Government had also
taken the precaution of sending to Avignon to ask
the attendance of some one of the Benedictine
monastery, whose evidence would be material, but
who, residing in a foreign territory, could not be
summoned; and the arrival of one of the brethren
was daily expected.</p>

<p>"My terror may easily be conceived in these circumstances.
Should the domiciliary visit lead to
my being in ever so slight a degree suspected, I was
sure to be at once identified by the testimony of the
monk who might come from Avignon; and even if
I escaped this fate, he was sure to give a more correct
account of the facts than common report had

<!-- vol 1 page 139 -->

propagated, so that the pastor could no longer be
kept ignorant of the deception I had practised upon
him in laying the chief blame upon Isidore. Happily,
a reluctance on the abbot's part to suffer his
brother's examination in a secular court delayed
the arrival I so much dreaded, and the domiciliary
visit was postponed for the present. Yet I lived in
perpetual fear, and learnt by experience that there
is no suffering which so renders man weary of existence,
and so perpetually makes life a burden.
What I endured made me easily believe the accounts
of persons who have destroyed themselves
under the terror of dangers to which they were exposed,
and as for self-murder of a like kind committed
to escape disgrace and public odium, I could
at all times well credit the possibility of it.</p>

<p>"My only solace during this period was the kindness
of the pastor and his family, who, seeing how
much I was suffering, exerted themselves to relieve
me. Nothing more soothed my troubled spirit than
the religious conversation than Monsieur Gardein,
in which he mingled learned and rational argument
with spiritual consolation. We discussed together
freely all the points of dispute between the two
churches, and certainly the result was to confirm all

<!-- vol 1 page 140 -->

the impressions which Isidore's reasonings and
railleries had made on me, and to wean me entirely
from the errors of the Romish faith. This conversion
was much aided by the judicious course
which the pastor took. He was a man of great
learning and much ability, but he was also of a
singularly moderate disposition; tolerant of adverse
opinions, and regarding those whom he deemed benighted
in error with compassion, but without the
least pride of conscious superiority far less any feeling
of hostility. His respectful treatment of even
the dogmas to which his clear judgment stood
most opposed, helped him to make many a proselyte
whom a more fierce and contemptuous disputant
would have for ever alienated and confirmed
in error at the very outset of the argument
by haughty assertion, or scorn, or misplaced ridicule.
Indeed he held that ridicule was never to be used
in discussing sacred subjects, both because it wounds
the feelings of the unconverted and because it shuts
their minds up against the entrance of the truth.
This subject of employing ridicule is difficult, in my
apprehension, and a distinction is to be taken between
the different kinds of ridicule. The statement of an
absurd consequence drawn clearly from any position,

<!-- vol 1 page 141 -->

the exposure of its self-repugnance, or other gross
absurdity and senselessness, inevitably produces a
tendency to laugh, inevitably produces a ludicrous
effect. So far, and of this description, ridicule is a
necessary part of demonstration. The superficial
and ignorant vulgar, always confounding unlike
things, are perpetually crying out on either a written
or a conversational argument of this truly logical
kind that it is merriment and not reasoning, whereas
it is the closest and most urgent demonstration. But
when to this we add any superfluous picture of a
ludicrous kind, and call in anything laughable in
manner, or character, or habits, anything personal
to the disputant, we clearly go beyond what is the
legitimate province of reasoning, especially upon
sacred subjects. Nothing could, for example, be
more fit than to expose the great absurdity of
making our senses the test of the words received
from Christ through the Evangelists, and then
holding their evidence inadmissible to show that
the bread and wine have retained their humble
nature after the priest's benediction. You may even
go so far as to show the ridiculous consequence that
flows from the doctrine, namely, that a created
being is supposed to make, at least to summon into

<!-- vol 1 page 142 -->

his presence, the God who made him. But if you
enter into details, letting your fancy luxuriate in
the difference between bread and flesh, wine and
blood, or speak of a God-maker, or a God-smith, a
God-eater, or a God-monger, you needlessly import
the ludicrous into a most solemn argument, and
descend from the pure and refined wit of reason to
the broad and vulgar grins of humour. From the
turn of the good pastor's mind, at once serious and
forbearing, he applied this principle to all controversy,
even on secular matters; and he had a practice
in reasoning of rather leaving his adversary to
perceive the ridiculous in his own argument, or its
consequences, than stating it in terms to him. He,
perhaps, was skilful as well as tolerant in this course,
for it is certain that there is more or less of triumph
in the ordinary proceeding of disputants, who press
each other with the weight of their argument, and
are over-fond of the pleasure derived from the exposure
of absurdity. The Socratic method of discussion
by questions pressed upon the adversary, and
making him state his own error, and as it were take
of himself the steps to his own refutation, proceeded
upon somewhat of the same view. Be that as it
may, I can affirm that M. Gardein was a formidable

<!-- vol 1 page 143 -->

disputant, not more from his acuteness and his
learning, than from his suavity, and his carefully
abstaining from showing triumph or giving offence
in any other way. He in this, as in many other
features of his amiable and attractive character, bore
no little resemblance to my dear and ever lamented
Father Jerome; and had the excellent, and indeed
well-gifted, Isidore possessed somewhat of his moderation
and self-command, I am certain that my
conversion would have been accomplished before I
left the convent.</p>

<p>"Much, however, as I owed my escape from the
grievous errors of Romanism to the reasoning and
the information of the good pastor, I believe that my
liberation from the fallacies with which that most
artfully contrived system enchains the mind was
greatly aided by the co-operation of another cause.
The domestic society in which I saw him living
and teaching, the endearing company of his wife, of
his daughter, and her children, those ties which, far
from lessening his clerical usefulness, only redoubled
his powers of persuasion, and, far from impairing
his zeal in the service of God, only made it burn
with the purer flame, lit at the tenderest and most
innocent feelings of the heart, had a powerful influence

<!-- vol 1 page 144 -->

on my mind, because I daily witnessed the
practical exposure of the falsehoods which Popery
inculcates, and proved, by constant evidence of my
senses, that the state which is natural for man is in
nowise dangerous to priests, but, on the contrary,
increases their usefulness while it relieves them from
the pains of unnatural restraint, and gratifies the
most innocent propensities of the human heart. All
Isidore's arguments about the clergy refusing themselves
one of the sacraments had been feeble compared
to the practical experience which I now had
of a married clergyman, a pastor, at once the
spiritual father of his flock and the natural father
of his family.</p>

<p>"As the period of the domiciliary visit and the
Benedictine's arrival approached, I grew more and
more uneasy. I scarcely dared venture into the
streets for fear of exciting suspicion. Walking in
the Place at an early hour, for I never ventured out
except in the morning and evening, I heard, to my
extreme horror, a voice calling out my name twice,
'Albert! Albert!' I instantly turned round, and was
relieved to find it was a woman calling on her child
that ran across the walk. But this had at least
shown her that my name was Albert.&mdash;One day I

<!-- vol 1 page 145 -->

walked to the Maison Carr&eacute;e to indulge in the
recollections of past ages, and taste if possible of
the peace which, its inscription says, had been established
over the world; a face which was familiar
to me almost fixed me to the ground; it was a
gentleman from Avignon to whom I was known,
though slightly. I had only presence of mind to
turn round and abruptly quit the portico, on whose
numberless beauties he was intently gazing.&mdash;I had
some days before seen a travelling musician at the
public gardens whom I recognized, but who knew
me too little to perceive who I was; yet the alarm
which even this gave me had driven me home for
several days, until I supposed the minstrel had departed
in pursuit of his erratic calling. But all
these things, and numberless other alarms which
proved false, showed me that my present place of
concealment was too near the spot of my shame.
The distance was not, indeed, above ten leagues, and
though both political and religious considerations
restrained the intercourse between the centres of heterodoxy
and orthodoxy, yet intercourse there was,
quite enough to bring real risk upon me.</p>

<p>"I accordingly seriously planned my departure, and
having consulted with my kind and revered friend, he

<!-- vol 1 page 146 -->

helped me, to the utmost extent of his small means, in
the accomplishment of this design. All communication
with my family at Avignon had of necessity been
broken off. My writing or receiving letters would
have led to a discovery of my retreat, and even
M. Gardein was forced to keep the strictest silence on
the subject in his correspondence. Once only he had
an opportunity of privately apprizing my wretched parents
of my being safe for the moment; and he learnt
from a friend who had seen them, that their grief was
largely mingled with the horror of what had passed,
so natural to all persons of right feeling, especially
such as strictly held by the religion of their ancestors.
Any effort to supply my wants could be
little expected from them; they considered me as
lost to my family as well as my faith, and that
they had now to bewail the loss of another son, but
in circumstances far more distressing than those
which accompanied their former misfortune of the
like kind. But the kind good pastor did not dismiss
me on my weary, solitary, and melancholy
pilgrimage, merely filling as far as he was able
my scrip. He thought he had a higher duty to
discharge, and one peculiarly belonging to his
sacred function,&mdash;the duty of giving me such counsels

<!-- vol 1 page 147 -->

and such warnings as his longer experience
had suggested, and as one in my circumstances
peculiarly stood in need of. This conversation made
a deep impression upon my mind; it was at night,
after the frugal supper of the family had been
succeeded by worship. He retired with me into
his study, and kept me in discourse above an hour.
Before I went to bed I took a memorandum of
what he had then spoken, and I soon afterwards
extended it so as to preserve both the substance and
the expression, which was exceedingly simple but
earnest. This precious memorial of my third father,
I have in all the vicissitudes of my life been allowed
to preserve, and I will read it to you when next
you come here; for I am too much exhausted now
to continue a conversation which, though it has some
tendency to relieve me, is sadly mingled with the
most painful recollections."</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">CONVERSATION IN LANGUEDOC.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Count returned to the Ch&acirc;teau entirely occupied
with the strange and dreadful story of Albert.
As nothing more fills or distracts the mind than a
constant state of anxiety and alarm, so no relations
more arrest the attention, and make the hearer not
merely feel sympathy, but actually partake of the
painful sense of danger described; and the Count,
whose imagination was sufficiently lively, and whose
feelings were strong, shared largely in all that the
Solitary had depicted of his state of mind. He felt
uneasy; he was disturbed by the perpetual recurrence
of the scenes which Albert had traced before
him; he saw the officers of justice and the emissaries
of the church in pursuit of his friend; and he found
difficulty in believing, that even now, when all the
wanderings of Albert had brought him safe to his

<!-- vol 1 page 149 -->

retreat, that retreat itself, and the greatly diminished
zeal of the clergy, with their much restricted power
during late years, could make him quite secure
against discovery and persecution. The likeness
which the Baron de Moulin bore to the tenant of
the cave, seemed to keep before his eyes the picture
he had just come from gazing on; that resemblance
was as great as could well exist between a very
handsome and a very ordinary countenance, like the
Baron's, whose features, however, were abundantly
expressive, and had the impress of genius which
always precludes any appearance of deformity. In
his presence the Count's mind still more keenly dwelt
upon the sad story of Albert; and he fell more than
once into a reverie, which was speedily perceived by
his fair partner. As soon as she could find him
alone, she assailed him with an eagerness which in
company she with difficulty suppressed. "Well
then; and you have been to hear the wild and crazy
hermit's tale? Of course he has satisfied your easy
mind perfectly as to the visits of your friend the
Marchioness?"&mdash;"That he most entirely has," said
Chatillon, "nor was it difficult. My opinion of
her is very high indeed; and I find, as I truly
expected, that nothing was ever more completely

<!-- vol 1 page 150 -->

groundless than the suspicions cast on her conduct."&mdash;"Oh!
no doubt," said the Countess, "quite groundless;
and without the least colour of probability
from the first.&mdash;Mind you, Chatillon," she continued,
"I will believe all you now affirm, in terms
so very general, as soon as you let me know what
were the Solitary's communications to you, and as
certainly not otherwise."&mdash;"My love," he replied
"I am most perfectly indifferent."&mdash;"None of your
insolent abuse," she exclaimed; "say at once,
frankly and freely, that you choose not to confide
the matter to me, because it is of a kind better
kept concealed, and I am satisfied; but no impertinence,
I desire"&mdash;and with that she flung out of
the room, all the more convinced by Chatillon's
silence, that her suspicions were anything but
groundless.</p>

<p>The Count, to relieve his mind, ruffled by his
fair helpmate's temper, walked out into the delightful
shrubbery that surrounded the Ch&acirc;teau. The rest
of the company continued conversing on the subject
which the Count's musing disposition, so new in
him, suggested; and the discourse turned, as it is
wont to do, upon the two absent members of the
society. On no occasion are the absent ever more

<!-- vol 1 page 151 -->

uniformly in the wrong, and without exception, than
when they leave assembled the contents of a Ch&acirc;teau,
persons for the most part idle, and who, being
without pursuits when in the house, occupy themselves
diligently with the concerns and the persons
of their neighbours in the same society. The precise
period of the day when the absent are most
generally in the wrong, and when they form the
most animated part of the conversation, is when
dinner is waiting for their arrival. But at no time
of the twenty-four hours are they apt to be very
much spared by the company present. So it fared
with the Count and the Countess on this occasion.
While they were occupied, the one in a solitary walk,
with musing over the strange adventures
of Albert, the other in her boudoir with her extensive
and various correspondence, and with the journals
which she diligently studied, and which began now to
be filled with speculations on the unquiet aspect of
affairs, the company were employed in descanting
upon the two absentees, each after his own fashion
and humour.</p>

<p>"I marvel," said the Marquess, "that our good
and light-hearted Count should have chosen his present
wife, so different from him in both temper and

<!-- vol 1 page 152 -->

taste. She was a widow, too, and had not made
her first husband happy."</p>

<p>"Have you not observed," answered the Baron,
"that men as well as women are apt to fix their
affections on somebody very different from themselves?
How often do you see close friendships
knit between men of the greatest dissimilarity of
character and of pursuits?"</p>

<p>"Yes, truly," the Marquess observed; "there is
always one obstacle removed by such a difference&mdash;there
is no interference, and thus no rivalry.
However, I believe your remark has another foundation
as to men's choice of a mistress or a wife.
The variety is pleasing; the turn of mind so
different from our own amuses; it is what we term
<i>piquant</i>."</p>

<p>"For which," said the Marchioness, "I have often
remarked we have in our insular language no word,
though we have many that cannot be translated into
your tongue."</p>

<p>"But surely," rejoined the Baron, with much
animation, "the matchless beauty of the Countess
must at once furnish a key to her husband's preference
for her. Saw you ever beyond the Alps more
perfect loveliness than our Tramontane fair one discloses?"

<!-- vol 1 page 153 -->

addressing himself to Prince Caramelli, who
had just arrived from Florence and been visiting the
Pont du Gard.</p>

<p>"Why, really, Baron," replied the Tuscan, "I
must at once be ungallant enough to answer with a
positive Yes. In the first place your fair one is of
an advanced age."</p>

<p>"An advanced age. Prince! Why she is barely
thirty."</p>

<p>"Barely thirty! Baron," said the Italian&mdash;"Had
you said barely twenty&mdash;very well. But I own to
you the addition of ten years is not very much to my
taste. I might admire her society, might even relish
the remains of former beauty, and let her live upon a
recollection of past charms&mdash;I might make her my
friend, but as for anything else, you will excuse me."</p>

<p>However, the rest of the company, though not so
particular on the point of age, wholly denied the
correctness of the phrase selected by the Baron to
portray the object of his present devotion.</p>

<p>"Really," said the gentle Emmeline, "dear Zio,
for so great a master of diction as you to choose the
word 'loveliness,' and 'perfect loveliness,' as descriptive
of the Countess, does, I own, a little surprise
one. Incomparable beauty, if you will; but

<!-- vol 1 page 154 -->

surely to loveliness there goes something beyond
form."</p>

<p>"I agree with Mdlle. de Moulin," said the Marchioness,
"and I will add, what of course she meant
to allow, that though Madame de Chatillon has great
expression as well as fine form&mdash;it is not a lovely
expression at all. It is full of intellect, but it is
also tinctured with both pride and temper."</p>

<p>"Two things the most inconsistent with the idea
of lovely, certainly," said Emmeline. "But I hardly
wished to say so much against any one I know so
little, and am taught by my dear Zio to respect so
highly. I only meant to say that she shows some
tartness of disposition which little suits my poor
humble taste."</p>

<p>"Come," said the Marquess, "I will not stop there.
I freely confess to you, Baron, that I never could
admire her at all. Her beauty is haughty; she
enters the room as if she came to dictate, and expected
to be obeyed without hesitation; moreover she
has that sort of look as if she were the only virtuous
person in whatever female society she honours with
her presence, and almost the only person of talents
or information in the male circles, where she most
likes to move and to shine."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 155 -->

<p>"Let me tell you, Marquess," said the captivated
Baron, "that when a person is so endowed as she is,
and leads also a life so pure, she may well hold her
head high above the frivolous and the corrupt age in
which she lives. But her harshness, of which you
all complain&mdash;is it not well redeemed by the truth
and honour it is akin to, and allied with? Who
could ever charge her with a falsehood? When
did the breath of slander ever settle upon her
reputation?"</p>

<p>While these things were under discussion there
arrived at the Ch&acirc;teau two guests of note from
Nismes; Madame Leblanc, a widow, considerably
past her prime, but who, from her position in society,
had also considerable currency; and the Abb&eacute;
Miltaud, a leader of the high fanatical party, to
which the widow herself somewhat inclined. Accordingly
the reverend personage had not scrupled
to travel with her the journey from Nismes; "albeit
it was," as he observed, "of more than one
hour's duration; and albeit she was not much more
than five-and-forty years of age complete." She
naturally glided into the conversation, in which her
niche was not likely to be filled in her absence. No
sooner had she thus placed herself than she asked if

<!-- vol 1 page 156 -->

the Countess had not set out for Grenoble; and
finding she was still a guest at the Ch&acirc;teau, but also
that she had retired for the morning to her extensive
correspondence, and that the Count was gone to
the chase, she felt it her duty to take these absentees
under her especial protection; not, however, without
aid of her spiritual friend the Abb&eacute;, whom she thus
invoked, somewhat without asking his consent.</p>

<p>"Aye, truly&mdash;correspondence indeed! The
Abb&eacute; and I have just been wondering what Madame
de Chatillon writes about; for we hear at Nismes
that her letters equal in number those of many
merchants, and some ministers of state."</p>

<p>"Verily, Madame," said the reverend man, "I
remember me not the remark you mention as having
beguiled the time spent on the way. Peradventure
was I then commending me to His care who maketh
the rough places smooth, and guards them that travel
by land and water from the perils of their path.
But as to the post-office, know I little or nothing,
being of them that use it not."</p>

<p>"But, Abb&eacute;," rejoined Madame Leblanc, "at
least you must remember having said you deemed
the Countess more intent on the things of this
world than of another; and when I said that the

<!-- vol 1 page 157 -->

case was a common one, you said, The more's the
pity, and the less the excuse."</p>

<p>"Yes, verily, sister, did I so deliver myself; to
the which you replied, that you could have more
easily forgiven her worldly-mindedness if she only
could now and then show a little charity toward
offending brethren."</p>

<p>"Well, and so I still say&mdash;for, considering how
many offend, surely nothing is more needful than a
capacious and almost indiscriminate charity. There,
for instance, is La Mar&eacute;chale de Bournon, whom I
never shall say one word against, nor can I say one
word for her neither, for I believe she is no better
than she should be."</p>

<p>"Truly," said the Baron, "it is a somewhat
hard measure of justice to require her to be better
than she ought to be."</p>

<p>"Well, well, as you please,"&mdash;she replied, "I
speak always well of her; better than I can think&mdash;though,
indeed, I like her much, only I can get
nobody to agree with me. But there's the dear
Countess de Pignerol, whose adventure with the
Italian Prince is much talked of&mdash;and my belief is
that he owes his principality to her good graces; for
a lady told me that he was neither more nor less

<!-- vol 1 page 158 -->

than a courier, whom some Prince turned off. But
God help us! we are all but weak and sinful creatures
without His aid. And if it be His pleasure
the Pignerol should thus have gone astray, His
will be done."</p>

<p>"Amen! amen!" ejaculated the holy man.</p>

<p>"So I say of the Countess, and when I hear
people all saying she only minds politics, and having
never had any children by either marriage, can
think of nothing domestic, here I must take her
part. She has long had a lover, to my certain knowledge,
and that page of hers who is always on the
fetch and carry is as like her as ever he can look."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the Marchioness, "a child she
never had, and as to the boy being, as you would
insinuate, some kind of natural relation, some child
of her father or her brother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ma'am, I only said she never had had any child
<i>since</i> her marriage; I go not, God forbid I should, to
any thing that may have happened before, either with
M. Bertrand or any one else, whatever I may know
personally on this subject."</p>

<p>"Really, Madame Leblanc, you are too bad
with your anecdotes and your personal knowledge,"
said the Marchioness.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 159 -->

<p>"Why, look you, my dear," replied the lady of
much charity, "you should be cautious of discrediting
even a report; for, as we are all in search of truth,
how easily may we be deceived by incredulity!"</p>

<p>"But," said the Baron, unable longer to contain
himself, "how much more injustice may we do by
easy belief!"</p>

<p>"There I must differ with you," said she of the
considerate mind; "you will observe that a great deal
is always sure to be done that never gets out, so
that I generally find it a safe rule to believe <i>at least</i>
what I hear. A lady told me that she knew the
affair with M. Bertrand, and that it is as much
alive as ever."</p>

<p>"That I'll be sworn it is," said the Baron, "and
I fairly tell you I don't believe one word of it."</p>

<p>"How extremely ill-natured that is, Baron! How
hard upon the lady I have been quoting! Have you
no regard for her character? Why should you so
slander one you don't know?"</p>

<p>"And whom I never shall know, I dare swear,"
said the Baron.</p>

<p>"But, Sir," said the woman slow to blame, "you
do neither more nor less than positively charge her
with bearing false witness against her neighbour. How

<!-- vol 1 page 160 -->

should you like any one disbelieving a story you had
told, and of which you knew all the particulars?"</p>

<p>"Verily, and of a truth," said the Abb&eacute;, "you
put the matter in a Christian manner. Howbeit,
I would say a word for the other party, the
Countess, but that I learn she is taking part with
the evil disposed, who now infest our land&mdash;nay, purposes
going with her obedient husband to Grenoble,
where the work of the father of mischief is now for
a season permitted by the Lord to prosper."</p>

<p>"Aye, truly, Abb&eacute;, well may you say so; there
she says she must go, and go she will. Her obedient
husband, indeed! well may you so call him; and
her patient, her much-enduring, and her long-suffering
husband. My heart melts when I think of
him; it bleeds within me to see so much good
nature so rewarded with oppression. However, he
comforts himself in other quarters&mdash;of that, at least,
there can be no doubt. But let us be just, even to
sinners. It is not true that he keeps four mistresses
and introduces them into his house. I believe he
never has had more than two at one time; and if
they are admitted into his house, it is always by a
back door, so as no one not in the secret shall
know anything about it."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 161 -->

<p>The Marquess here wished to turn aside the conversation
from its present channel, wherein it might
have flowed without any interruption, or any end;
so he reverted to Grenoble, willing to hear the Abb&eacute;
upon a topic in which he took much interest. But
at this moment entered the Countess herself, she
having finished her day's despatches; and all eyes
were at once turned upon her; as happens on
any conversation being suddenly extinguished by
appearance of its subject.</p>

<p>"Well, Baron," she said, on entering the saloon,
"you will find I am right as to the great event of
the States of Dauphin&eacute;. They are beginning to put
themselves in an attitude; and if this does not lead
to something material, I am much more mistaken
than I have usually been."</p>

<p>"My dear Madam," answered the Baron, "I
never had any doubt whatever that something would
come of it. I only questioned your very sanguine
view, that all grievances were to be redressed in less
time than it would take to draw up a catalogue of
them; and I am averse to sudden change, well
knowing that the fruit which grows fast spoils
quick."</p>

<p>"They do tell me," said the Abb&eacute;, "that some

<!-- vol 1 page 162 -->

mention hath already been made of tithe, as if <i>that</i>
were a grievance. Help us! what shall we next
see?"</p>

<p>"Why really, Abb&eacute;," said the Countess, "were
that our only grievance, there would need but
little time and less trouble to rid ourselves. My
opinion is for a clergy like the Swiss, among whom
I was brought up, a poor and a working clergy."</p>

<p>"Mercy on us, to hear you talk! a poor and a
working clergy! What! Shall they which serve at
the altar not live by the altar? What portion of
worldly goods cometh ever to my poor share, that
do I freely take unto me; as knowing, that it is
the portion of the Lord, and appertaining unto Him
and His church, to whom and to which all glory
for ever and ever!"</p>

<p>"Amen," ejaculated Madame Leblanc; "nevertheless,
I could wish that in taking their share of
our goods, they would let alone our persons. I am
sure I have more than suspicions of the Abb&eacute;
Lafosse and Madame Bertrand. I refer to his late
visits and his long walks; and they do say the
bishop has given him severe admonition."</p>

<p>"Sister!" said the Abb&eacute;, "it little becomes you
so to speak of the church. The pious should distrust

<!-- vol 1 page 163 -->

their eyes, and yet more their ears, rather
than lightly believe in disparagement of the people
of God. My brother Lafosse is of the elect, and
can hardly fall from grace. Haply," said the pious
man, "the Lord Bishop's admonition which you wot
of touched some point of doctrine, wherein the Abb&eacute;
might have gone astray from the path, and peradventure
might lack wholesome correction."</p>

<p>"Abb&eacute;," said Madame Leblanc, "let you and I
take a little walk in the shrubbery, before we go
back to Nismes."</p>

<p>"Yea, verily, sister," said the holy individual,
"for it now is waxing late; and I may not go on
the way after the setting of the sun alone even
with you in a carriage."</p>

<p>"Nor in a carriage even without me either.
Abb&eacute;," said the charitable; "I observed you were
in serious alarm each little jolt that we had on the
smooth road coming out."</p>

<p>"Truly," said he, "and I do but regard it as a
tempting of Providence, when I expose me to any
kind of risk&mdash;save the hourly risk we ever run; for
in the midst of life we are in death."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Countess, as soon as they
were gone, "thank heaven, we have got rid of this

<!-- vol 1 page 164 -->

canting pair! However, Madame Leblanc is not,
by half, so bad as this Abb&eacute;; and as to her having
some little <i>causeries</i>, I really hardly complain of
that; for her abuse is no slander, so well is her
venom known. I verily believe I am the only person
of her acquaintance whom she has not freely
charged with a <i>faux pas;</i> and that I ascribe more
to my own prudence and reserve on all occasions,
than to her forbearance."</p>

<p>"Oh! certainly," said the Marquess, "you set her
at defiance. But also she may set you at defiance;
for you don't hear what she says, any more than if
it suited her humour she would care what you
did."</p>

<p>There was a kind of smile on the Marquess's face as
he spoke this, that seemed more significant than the
fair lady, all conscious of her virtue, quite relished.
Having assumed, and almost declared, that she was
not merely above blame, but beyond attack, she
now thought she had been under the searching
operation of Madame Leblanc's unsparing tongue
before she rejoined the company, and she immediately
wore her enraged aspect as she said: "Well,
I do believe that is the very worst woman in
Nismes."</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 165 -->

<p>The Count here came in, having returned from
the forest, where he had been shooting, to relieve
his thoughts of the mournful impression
made on him by the history of Albert, and to
beguile the time, which he thought an age, till his
curiosity should be gratified by the remainder of
that strange and affecting story.</p>

<p>Prince Caramelli returned from his drawing excursion
before dinner, and interested the party
greatly by the exquisite sketches he had made of
the Pont du Gard; which he pronounced more than
Roman in its magnificent and perfectly preserved
architecture. "I really," said he, "never could
have imagined the French had such good builders.
We generally plume ourselves upon our Italian
masonry, and the buildings at Rome, particularly
the older ones, which I suppose date as far back
as our Gothic ancestors, are thought very fine,
though now a good deal destroyed, and, in some
places, fallen to pieces. But positively I find
nothing, even in St. Peter's, equal to the Pont du
Gard."</p>

<p>"The Pont," said the Baron, "is not a French
structure, nor even one by the Gauls."</p>

<p>"Were the Gauls a French province?" innocently

<!-- vol 1 page 166 -->

asked the Prince. But no one dared enter
fully into this antiquarian discussion, out of charity
towards this accomplished descendant of the brave
Etrurians, who had the blood of the Medici in his
veins, though he valued himself far more on his
Gothic descent.</p>

<p>In the evening he delighted the ears of the company
with his music still more than he had their
eyes by his drawings. He was an admirable
player both on the piano-forte and the violin, sang
beautifully either a first or a second part, was so
passionately fond of music that he discoursed eloquently
respecting it, and had so much real taste
that he almost seemed learned upon the subject.
His contempt too for all others, when his favourite
subjects of the pencil and the lyre were on the
carpet, was only half concealed by his perfect politeness.
He plainly perceived, or thought he perceived,
that the French were, by some physical necessity,
incapable of the least relish for the productions
of either; and would cite, ten times in a day,
the unfortunate mistake of a gentleman whom he
had met at a Marseilles concert, and who, seeing
the music-book in his hand, had asked him "If that
Adagio was contemporary with Corelli?"</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 167 -->

<p>The conversation, however, was not suffered to
rest always on the fine arts. The Countess must
needs know what the feelings in Italy were on
the ferment now beginning in France, and turned
his attention to the assembling of the States at
Grenoble. The Prince had here as much to learn
on the art of discord as the amateur of Marseilles
had on that of harmony. He desired to know
what States were; and the Countess kindly undertook
to describe that they represented the different
orders of nobles, clergy, and commonalty. But
the idea of anybody being represented except by
his ambassador if a sovereign or his agent if a
private person, could not easily enter the Tuscan
mind; and when Madame de Chatillon said that
this assembly shared the powers of government in a
certain degree, he concluded they were officers and
men raised and commissioned by the king; for he
asked if they were a military corps, and drawn out
occasionally, or on permanent duty? When told they
were civil functionaries, he supposed they might be
a great department of clerks, appointed to conduct
the public business. It was impossible to make him
comprehend how the government could be carried
on by any person except under the king's authority;

<!-- vol 1 page 168 -->

when the Countess, gently for her, but with
an intelligent look that made no small impression on
his southern and inflammable nature, reminded him
of the republican time of Florence, her <i>balia</i>, her
<i>farsi publico</i>, her <i>parlamento</i>, she found him as
ignorant of the former history of his own country
as of the present state of France. All he could say
was, that no country could possibly exist in such a
state of confusion as she seemed to speak of, unless
perhaps England, which he had understood to be
under the dominion of a lawless multitude of many
hundreds, and to lie accordingly under such a heavy
curse of constant confusion that nothing should
ever induce him to venture near it. An orchestra
of bad fiddlers, without a book or a director,
seemed to him harmony compared with what he
concluded the parliamentary government must
needs be.</p>

<p>The Countess, finding all political discussion
for ever shut out in this quarter, was fain to sit by
while he either charmed the company with some
more airs, or with the almost equally pleasing
melody of his conversation; for he was a Sienese,
and with the most beautiful Tuscan he had not any
of the harsh guttural pronunciation so unpleasant at

<!-- vol 1 page 169 -->

Florence, Pisa, and Leghorn. His small talk, though
far inferior to that of our own countrymen, was
agreeable, and the animation which his excitable
nature ever showed, prevented his emptiness from
being dull. To his ignorance there was a compensation
in his fire, which rendered him anything
but insipid; while his perfect manners and imperturbable
good nature made an impression on all
who valued those lighter qualities. Emmeline, who
had never seen an Italian, was much struck with
him, and afterwards made a remark which even
the profound and fastidious Countess thought had
something in it: She said it was singular to see
how a person might appear to have strong feelings
who had only in all probability warm passions,
and most likely no feelings at all; for she could
not conceive it possible that a person of the Prince's
station and family could have remained ignorant
of every thing even relating to the history of his
own country and his own house, if he had possessed
the least dignity of character or any self-respect.</p>

<p>With all these claims to the contempt of reflecting
or manly natures, there was nevertheless so much
to attract in the Prince's winning exterior, and his

<!-- vol 1 page 170 -->

frivolous accomplishments; his countenance, like
that of so many Italians, was so intellectual, and
so plainly showed that the genius was in him but
asleep, and only requiring the torch of the educator
to awaken its fires; and his good nature so unruffled,
even by the eager animation of his southern
manner, that he proved a favourite in the society of
the Ch&acirc;teau, was easily borne, and even liked by
all&mdash;by all save the Baron, who could not endure
him; but this aversion arose from an accident that
worked on his pride, which blinded, and his fiery
temper, which impelled him; for he was very far
from intolerant of persons inferior to himself, and
even loved to repose upon their more tranquil dispositions.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the Prince had mistaken him for
another person in the company, Major Drelincourt,
an officer though not in uniform, who lived at Aix, to
whom he bore some resemblance, and with whom,
notwithstanding his imperturbable good nature, the
Prince had had an unpleasant quarrel in a place
of public resort in that town. Seeing the Baron in
the ante-room of the Ch&acirc;teau soon after his arrival,
he said, fiercely but not unpolitely, that until their
quarrel, interrupted by the regimental colonel's interference,

<!-- vol 1 page 171 -->

should be settled, one or other must
quit the place. The Baron furiously turned round
upon him, and asked when he, the Prince, intended
to go. The mistake was instantly discovered; an
ample apology was tendered with the explanation.
It was dryly and very imperfectly accepted; and
from that moment the Baron could not endure the
sight of one whose most innocent error had, by the
merest accident, been the occasion of an unintentional
annoyance to his feelings. Nor could he bear
the Major any more than the Prince, because his
idea was mixed up with what had happened. The
Marquess, having heard of the unfortunate circumstance,
did all he could to accommodate matters, and
it had the good effect of bringing about a reconciliation
between the real parties to the only quarrel that,
properly speaking, existed. But the Baron would
not be appeased, or rather he could not control
his humour, and he told Emmeline that they must
quit the Ch&acirc;teau, and continue their journey. Her
gentle nature was deeply wounded when she heard
the cause. She was at first exceedingly hurt that
her uncle had received any annoyance from any
cause, and still more that his pride blinded him to
a just view of the matter and of his position. Her

<!-- vol 1 page 172 -->

calm judgment now, as on so many other occasions,
saw things in their true light, and her rigid sense
of justice, a prevailing character of her mind, made
her really unhappy at seeing one whom she so
fondly loved violating that most sacred duty. She
cared little for the disappointment of leaving a place
to which she had begun to feel attached, from the
agreeable and instructive society assembled in it;
that or any other sacrifice of her own wishes, she
would cheerfully have made; and indeed one of her
uncle's greatest difficulties always was to find out
what she preferred, so carefully did she conceal her
own likings whenever she feared they might interfere
with his. But she could little endure the appearance
of the Baron going away from what she
could not help regarding as a somewhat childish
fit of humour. "Dearest Zio," she would say,
"do only, I beg and beseech you, consider that it
was all a mere mistake, an accident that might have
happened to any one as well as the Prince, and respecting
any one as well as you. A more harmless
man never lived than he seems to be, and he has
many good qualities."&mdash;"And the Major too,
whom he chose to take me for; I suppose, dear, <i>he</i>
is very harmless and agreeable. I never saw any

<!-- vol 1 page 173 -->

one less so, I own."&mdash;"No, no, dear Zio, I say nothing
of him, excepting this, that if possible, he is
even less to blame than the Prince, for he had no
part whatever in it, except being of your size, and
being taken for you in the dusk of the billiard-room."&mdash;"Well,
well, my little love, but they are
all mixed up in it; let them settle their affairs together
as they will; they have all been the occasion
of my getting angry before strangers, and being
hurt by an empty fool; and the idea of them is
hateful." A night's reflection, however, and the
unwillingness to give Emmeline pain, independent
of the reluctance to quit the Countess, which began
to operate powerfully, restored this proud person to
a more reasonable frame of mind; and he at any
rate would take no step, and say no more about
it, though he still said it was as hateful a thing
as had for many years happened to him; and no
entreaty even of Emmeline would induce him so far
to throw off his humour as to offer the Prince his
hand, or testify by any other courtesy his forgiveness
of an unintentional error which he could not
bring himself to forget.</p>

<p>Thus the evening and the next morning passed

<!-- vol 1 page 174 -->

quietly away, and the Count, impatient to hear
the continuation of Albert's story, again visited the
cave, when the Solitary proceeded to read his notes
of the good pastor's parting advice.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="small">THE PHILOSOPHY OF A LANGUEDOC PASTOR.</p>

</div>

<p>" '<span class="smcap">The</span> young delight in action; contemplation is
best suited and most pleasing to the old. But when
the heart is rightly attuned to humane feelings,
there is also a disposition in age to make its experience
profitable to youth. Not only is there a satisfaction
in dwelling upon the results of that experience,
wholly apart from all ideas of egotism; there
is a pleasure in conveying instruction, and in the
act of making their own history useful to others
they have a pleasing consciousness that they have
themselves not lived in vain.</p>

<p>" 'Do not be alarmed, my good young man, at
the prospect of a sermon. In the discharge of my
pastoral duties I am never ashamed of preaching,
nor reluctant to be instant in season and out of
season, for the truths committed to my care. Woe

<!-- vol 1 page 176 -->

be to me if I shun the service of my Master! But
I have mixed with the world, as well as with the
silent inmates of my study, and I have lived in society
as well as in the pulpit. My lessons are of
a kind that gownsmen fear too much the ridicule
connected with familiar topics to teach on the Lord's
day. The successors of our Saviour, even in early
ages, much more the preachers of his Gospel in
modern days, have lacked the gift of that divine
taste as well as wisdom which dictated the exquisitely
delicate composition of the parables. All their
exhortations must for want of it be covered over with
generalities, and, between the dread of exciting
laughter and the fear of giving offence, the most
impressive kinds of moral instruction are neglected,
nay shunned by all who publicly teach the people.
I shall address myself to you on the present
occasion without any apprehension of either ridicule
or resentment. My purpose is above suspicion;
my heart is single; and on the margin of the grave
into which I must soon descend I now stand, to give
you the result of my observations upon the world
into which you are entering, not forgetting also the
great topic of things unseen.</p>

<p>" 'And I begin with that greatest of all subjects

<!-- vol 1 page 177 -->

on which the mind can dwell, the highest to which
it is permitted to soar.</p>

<p>" 'Think not that I use a clerical common-place,
or am guilty of a professional exaggeration, when I
affirm with the solemnity of a death-bed declaration,
that in comparison with the sense of God's
presence all other considerations are as of no importance,
and compared with the hope of his future
favour all earthly things are of no value. Whoever
has known sorrow, and whoever has known sin, provided
only he believes, will know also the necessity
of this consolation to sustain him. When, under the
pressure of either, the soul sinks within us, there is
no effort from without can raise it up; and yet such
is the incurable perverseness of human nature that
I have generally found a less lively sense of religion
in those whose lot was mournful, than in persons of
happy circumstances and of a cheerful disposition.
You, my dear young friend, belong, unfortunately,
to the less favoured class, and on your mind there
hangs a load, the accumulation of unlawful passions
criminally indulged; as over your destiny
there hovers a cloud which improvidence combined
with accident, has gathered to darken your prospects.
Oh hear the voice which bids you flee to the

<!-- vol 1 page 178 -->

sanctuary for comfort! When all without frowns,
and the world is bleak to the eye, the torch of piety
lights us from within on our weary way. We can
lay our head on the hardest pillow, and commend
ourselves to his care who made the world; and even
when oppressed with a sense of our own transgressions,
though far from me be the attempt to inculcate
an indifference or a callousness to the stings of
conscience, still the sincere penitent may humbly
hope for mercy, casting his look forward to the happier
state of being, where sorrow shall cease, even
sins be forgiven, and the inward monitor, ever jealous
of neglect, shall torment no more.</p>

<p>" 'My hope is in revelation. I anchor my soul to
that rock; then think not that anything I am about
to say betokens a preference for another scheme of
devotion, another ground of belief. But then I never
shifted my faith like you, and it never has been
shaken. You have left one church, a dogmatical,
infallible, unreasoning church, and have come over,
after long struggles, to another creed. I know not
how much this rude trial may have unhinged your
belief, how soon you may be visited with fresh
doubts, with new misgivings, a thing I have so often
witnessed, that for ignorant and for feeble minds I

<!-- vol 1 page 179 -->

have ever considered the risks of conversion to our
purer form of worship as more than counterbalancing
the benefits of a nearer approach to the truth.
I hope with you it may prove otherwise; yet, in
case of scepticism ever invading your mind, I wish
to remind you that the greatest of all religious truths,
the belief in the existence of the Deity, rests upon
natural reason, not upon revelation; that the belief
in revelation pre-supposes a previous belief in a
Divine Being; that all we observe around us, all
we experience in our own minds, all we feel and see
of our own bodily frame, demonstrates the truth
that the greatest power and highest wisdom has
created the world, both natural and moral, and
presides over all its parts, all its movements, all its
fortunes. No rational being can be an atheist, or
even a sceptic, who examines a plant, an animal, an
insect, much less who studies his own body or
his own mind, or who lifts his eyes on the wonders
of the planetary system and surveys the starry heavens.
But the hopes of a Future State belong more
clearly to the revelation of Him "who is the resurrection
and the life." Nevertheless, even from these
the pure theist, relying on the light of Nature, is
not shut out; and I have known several men who

<!-- vol 1 page 180 -->

had the great misfortune of doubting the truth of
Christianity, and yet had nearly as firm a belief in a
Future State as in a present Deity. The nature of
the mind, its surviving the body's decay, its continuing
the same while every portion of the corporeal
frame is over and over again renewed and changed,
forms indeed a cogent argument for its not perishing
when that frame is dissolved. The improvement
of the faculties to the very close of life, our greater
fitness for heavenly things at the moment of our
mortal existence ceasing, coupled with the prodigious
goodness of the Creator, who has filled all things
with proofs of his beneficence towards us, affords
another, and as strong an argument for the continuance
of our nobler part in another state of being.
The universality of religion, and of the belief in
immortality, is not to be despised as an auxiliary to
the argument; perhaps we might add the kindred
topic of the consent given to it by the wisest
and most enlightened men of all ages and of all
nations.</p>

<p>" 'Wherefore, whatever may betide thee, and even
should doubts unhappily assail and cloud thy mind
respecting revealed truth, by the faith in those matters,
which natural and revealed truth alike teach,

<!-- vol 1 page 181 -->

cling thou! By these eternal doctrines hold thou
fast! To them, and the comfort, the unutterable
comfort which they are fitted to afford, cleave thou!
Cherish them; revolve them; dwell upon them; give
them the first place in thy heart; meditate upon them
the first thing each morning, the last each evening;
let nothing ever sever thee from them: for in them
of a surety shalt thou find the sweetest enjoyment
in good fortune, and in evil the surest consolation!'</p>

<p>"Here the good old man, whose voice had sunk
in loudness, and had become a mere earnest whisper,
paused; he remained wrapped for a short space as if in
heavenly contemplation; his hands folded devoutly
over his breast; his eyes closed; his face turned upwards;
his cheeks suffused with a glow that broke
through their wonted paleness. When he opened
his eyes, in which a tear now stood, he presented
the very picture of a saint in devout contemplation;
but it was a saint without ascetic austerity, a devotion
without abject fear, a religion without spiritual
pride, a worship which gave glory to God, and
breathed good-will to men. After a few minutes he
tenderly squeezed my hands between both of his, and
then continued his interesting discourse.</p>

<p>" 'Think not that the future state of being which

<!-- vol 1 page 182 -->

I desire you ever to have before your mind, as well
in the seasons of action and of suffering as in moments
of calmer contemplation, is such as the vulgar
feign for want of pure and refined ideas. They
take the Oriental metaphors of Scripture in a literal
sense, as do the Mahometans with their sensual
paradise, the Hindoos with their extravagant superstitions.
Unable to conceive a soul existing separate
from the body with which they have always known
it united, these practical materialists easily fall into
the wild and gross error of fancying the fire described
in the Sacred Writings to be actual fire
such as consumes the body, and the torments of the
wicked to be of a kind which sends up smoke to
darken the air. Far more intolerable anguish than
any the nerves of the flesh can endure will be the
lot of those who pass their probationary time here
below the slaves of lawless passion, and rebellious to
the will of heaven. The ancient philosophers and
orators, in their benighted state, formed not a bad
notion of the fallacy that prevailed in the popular
notions of Hell. Those furies, said they, which
agitate the men whom they pursue, and are sometimes
represented on the stage, are the insatiable
passions, the vile propensities of our nature, disturbing

<!-- vol 1 page 183 -->

the reason and giving the soul no rest. Such
furies, unceasing in their torments, desires that vex
the mental frame and never can be gratified; rage
that spurns restraint and maddens the soul; revenge
burning with a thirst never to be slaked: fear that
sleeps not; shame that cannot be covered; self-abasement,
degradation in others' eyes; the stings of
a sleepless and avenging conscience; yet worse, the
terrible presence of the Most High, the insupportable
glare of the eye which is too pure to behold
iniquity&mdash;these are among the torments in store
for the wicked hereafter, and which, if constantly
thought of here below, might deter men from sin.
Nor is it unlikely that the very first suffering will
be the most unbearable. At once the judgment
being pronounced the veil will be torn away that
hitherto had concealed our wicked deeds and vile
thoughts from every eye but one. At once we shall
stand revealed in our real colours to all. Whatever
crimes we have committed in the flesh, and
kept secret with unceasing pains, will all be exhibited
in their true light. The secret thoughts of
the heart will be made public. All our shameful
propensities which we had thought would ever lie
hid in the bosom that they deformed; all our shameful

<!-- vol 1 page 184 -->

lusts scarce confessed to ourselves; our degrading
jealousies&mdash;our low envy&mdash;the anger we
had repressed when pretending indifference or affection;
the fears under which we had quailed when
affecting disregard of danger; the vicious thoughts
that had filled us while covered with the sanctimonious
garb of purity; the disregard of heaven that had
lurked beneath the hypocritical mask of devotion;
the furies that had agitated us and made us commit
murder in thought, now from hatred, now from
spite, now from sordid calculation of gain&mdash;all will
now be exposed. All others will read the darkest
secrets of our inmost heart; and our own minds, no
longer blinded with self-love, will be astounded with
the clear view of our real nature, concentrating
against ourselves all the hatred and all the scorn
with which we had ever hated or scorned our
neighbours! Think not, then, that I mitigate the
punishments of a Future State when I make them
such as a spirit unconnected with the body can undergo.
The Hell which I paint to you is far more
dreadful than any that poets have figured or the
vulgar fear.</p>

<p>" 'But believe me, my good young man, there are
not wanting other reasons against swerving from the

<!-- vol 1 page 185 -->

paths of innocence, and flying in the face of Heaven.
You cannot with impunity fly in the face of your
own conscience. You have felt its stints, and I will
not dwell upon the jurisdiction, severely, unsparingly,
unceasingly exercised by that judge, implanted in
our bosoms by Him who wills not that we should
swerve from the paths of virtue, but who also wills
that no deviation should go unpunished here below,
and therefore makes his delegated agent begin the
vengeance which himself will finish hereafter.</p>

<p>" 'But the delight of a virtuous life is less felt in
description than the sufferings of guilt, just as it is
far less easy to paint the enjoyments of heaven than
the torments of hell; a difference plainly experienced
by Dante, as all but enthusiastic admirers of the
great poet will freely admit. They partly from their
prejudice, and partly from the love of singularity
and the vanity of paradox, a common form of that
weakness, profess to admire the <i>Paradiso</i> most, and
they have few followers among persons of good sense
and honest judgment. Yet I think I may appeal to
your own experience when you contrast the peaceful
existence you passed in Father Jerome's society, before
you knew Louise Orange, with the turbulent
state of your excited feelings after your mind was

<!-- vol 1 page 186 -->

unsettled. There is a heavenly calm in feeling day
after day that we have left no duty unperformed,
and suffered no thought to gain admittance into our
minds, of which we should care that all the world
were aware as well as ourselves. When fortune
smiles on us, this consciousness of rectitude doubly
sweetens the cup of life; and when our lot is clouded
with adversity, the feeling that we have not brought
it upon ourselves, nay that we have not deserved it,
enables us patiently to bear the infliction. Even in
the exercise of patience itself, we come to take a
pleasure, which is one of the best preparations, if
indeed it be not an anticipation of a future and
more perfect being.</p>

<p>" 'Of the extreme difficulty of this I am aware.
Our nature is unhappily fundamentally gross, and
lamentably feeble. It is ill fitted to maintain either
its purity or its struggle with ills. We find it hard
to conceive how it shall suddenly put on the mantle of
innocence and strength. The doctrine of an intermediate
state of existence, which shall prepare our
souls for happiness, has, I am quite clear, no warrant
of Scripture. Yet some such preparation does seem
to me so necessary, that I regard the want of this
intimation as one of the things purposely withheld

<!-- vol 1 page 187 -->

from us in the volume of Revelation. That Sacred
Book, which is quite clear and precise in declaring
the great fact of life and immortality, and thus is
far above the volume of nature in its communications,
has no superiority whatever in the details,
and leaves us quite in the dark as to the mode and
manner of our future being. So it gives us no intimation
of any purifying or perfecting process. I
think it possible the omission may be owing to the
Divine Will being that we should make this world
the place of preparation; though after all our efforts
I cannot help fearing that we shall still be found
sadly wanting in capacity for at once being raised
into the mansions of perfect purity, and boundless
and most refined enjoyment.</p>

<p>" 'The nature of that enjoyment is wholly concealed
from our eyes, and for the wisest reasons. It
is probably such that unless our present frame of
mind were wholly changed, we should be unable to
sustain the burden of our existence on earth among
sorrows and privations, enfeebled by weakness, and
harassed by difficulties, even when not vexed by
pain or worn down by sorrow. But we may conceive
somewhat of the future bliss in store for the
virtuous, if we reflect on the purest gratifications of

<!-- vol 1 page 188 -->

which the mind is susceptible; the free interchange
of thoughts and affections with those we love; the
innocent recreations of alternating exertion and
repose; the contemplation of new and singular
truths; the pleasure of exerting our power in ministering
to our own improvement; and as in our
Father's home there are many mansions, we may
not all at once be admitted to the full perfection
which our nature is capable of attaining, but be
gradually raised from step to step, and thus be
always tasting the enjoyment of gratified curiosity
and conscious progression.</p>

<p>" 'There is assuredly one part, and in the purest
state of our faculties a most interesting part, of this
field over which a veil is drawn that we cannot help
wishing were removed. They who have known the
bitterest of sublunary afflictions, naturally are
anxious to be assured that those they have lost will
be restored, and that they shall again know one
another in the regions where there is no sorrowing,
and where separation from those they love shall
visit them no more. But the same wisdom, which
has shrouded the rest of our future prospects in
darkness, has suffered no light to beam upon this
portion of it, lest we should not be able to endure

<!-- vol 1 page 189 -->

our present privation and prematurely seek to
end it.</p>

<p>" 'And now, my dear youth, you are entering into
the world of action, of suffering, of misdeeds. If
your mind be not strengthened and supported by
fixed principles of conduct, by an unceasing regard
to him in whom you live, and move, and have your
being, by an unremitting dread of incurring your
own self-reproach, you are gone, and can hope no
more happiness either here or hereafter. Of all
virtuous character, and all blameless conduct, I need
hardly remind you that a sacred regard for truth is
the foundation; it is the corner-stone of the moral
structure. You know the scorn of yourself, the
shame which you felt even when no eye saw it, at
those concealments and fictions to which your offence
in the convent drove you; and the agony with which
you received Father Jerome's commendation for
supposed conduct the reverse of that you had been
pursuing. You remember too the disgust which
you ever felt at the cunning devices of Father
Ambrose, and the contempt with which the more
venial falsehoods of the Irish friar inspired you. To
have it said of one as Father Jerome said of him,
"The story may be true, although Father O'Halloran

<!-- vol 1 page 190 -->

told it,"&mdash;what can be more degrading?
What can render a rational being more utterly
despicable? Yet his untruths were not of the worst
kind; they were rather invented to help himself
than to hurt another; but be assured truth is so
sacred and paramount a duty, that it can never
with impunity be violated; and when you hear men
speak of white lies and pious frauds, tell them
boldly that no lies are white, though some are of a
blacker shade than others, and that all frauds are
impious, though some may be devised to compass a
worthy end. The God of truth and purity wills
that we seek good objects by right means, and has
appointed no dirty road by which men may clamber
even to heaven.</p>

<p>" 'In proportion as falsehood is abominable, and
undermines every portion of the mind, so are those
courses to be shunned which naturally lead to it.
You have never lived in Nismes, or indeed in any
society beyond the walls of your convent, else you
would have seen the consequences of violated truth
in the lives many of our grandees lead. The marriages
which are made spring from no mutual
attachment of the parties, hardly even from any
personal acquaintance. Often they are arranged by

<!-- vol 1 page 191 -->

the parents for their own convenience and the supposed
good of their children; almost always they
are matches of worldly interest, with a view to an
establishment alone. The heart, however, which
had not known love before the indissoluble knot was
tied, soon opens to receive what, wholesome before,
has now become poison. Attachments spring up,
which ripen into connections, criminal in themselves
and a breach of the conjugal vow, but doubly pernicious
in their consequences; for they can only be
indulged in secret, and must be covered over with
every cloak that female ingenuity can weave. Constant
dissimulation and pretence, endless contrivances
devised in falsehood, disguises of the real sentiments,
assumption of those not felt, an ever ready lie to
meet a charge as well as a suspicion&mdash;such are the
component parts of the existence thus passed in
guilt; and as of the hypocrite so may it be said of the
paramour, that his whole life is one lie. You have
known somewhat of the same mischief produced by
the unnatural restraints of the monastic state, and
you have often told me that there are few inmates of
a convent in whom the natural feelings and passions
are so entirely dead and the obligations of the vow
so cheerfully undertaken as to prevent much dissembling

<!-- vol 1 page 192 -->

and much pretence. The hypocrisy thus
engendered, you must have been fully sensible, could
never be maintained without irreparable injury to
the purity and sanctity of the character; and if you
had to choose in whom your confidence should be
reposed, you never could have failed to suspect
those for all purposes whom you knew accustomed
to practise insincerity for one.</p>

<p>" 'The great Christian rule of conduct forms one
unerring test of right acting; we have but to ask,
"How should I like to be so treated?" Another test
is also of much efficacy: "How should I like this to
be known?" And can anything be more humiliating,
can anything lower you more in your own estimation,
than to feel you are acting, or designing, or
even thinking, in a manner which, were the light let
in, and your deeds, or intentions, or thoughts, made
known to others, you would instantly become the
object of their aversion or their scorn? Can you be
more degraded than by feeling that you only owe
your escape from that hatred and that contempt to
the veil in which you shroud yourself? You thus
are wearing false colours, obtaining forbearance or
even commendation to which you have no right,
passing for that which you are not, not known for

<!-- vol 1 page 193 -->

what you are; in a word, you are a hypocrite, and
your life is a lie.</p>

<p>" 'Such is the sacredness of truth, so fatal is its
violation, which throws open the door wide to all evil,
that I will suffer nothing to palliate the least deviation.
All contrivance, all trickery, all stratagem,
all concealment, all pretence, I condemn as partaking
of the master-crime, father of all others, falsehood.
When men of experience in the ways of the
world lay down such maxims as are often in their
mouths, I try them by one test, "Do they consist
in dissimulation?" They will advise you, when
anxious to gain your object with others, that you
should appear indifferent or careless, and will assure
you that the less you seem anxious about it, the
nearer you are to success. True; if your object be
one you dare not avow; if you be in quest of something
you have no right to obtain; if you want to
throw your neighbour off his guard, in order to steal
a march on him&mdash;true; but if your purpose be
fair, why not openly avow it? If you don't want
to overreach, why fear to tell what you mean and
what you wish?</p>

<p>" 'I carry my hatred of falsehood from the highest
to the lowest subjects, and I will not even permit

<!-- vol 1 page 194 -->

what are called the harmless affectations of the
world. The concealment of our opinions too, the
avoiding of discussion when the truth is impugned
before us, the appearance of assent to avoid opposition,
whatever exceeds mere indolence, or good humour,
and the unwillingness to give pain by differing,
I proscribe as leading to dangerous habits of
insincerity. But above every thing, let there be no
pretence of affection that is not felt; no concealment
of contempt under the guise of respect. We are
not bound to express all our thoughts and feelings;
but we are bound to express nothing we do not think
and feel.</p>

<p>" 'I will freely own to you that, with the most perfect
veneration for the morality of the Gospel, I am
sometimes staggered when I reflect on the injunction
to love our enemies. That we are bound to return
good for evil, at all events that we are forbidden to
injure those who have injured us, no one can doubt;
this rule of the Gospel is easily obeyed; and its
observance doing no violence to our nature, offers no
injury to our sincerity. But it has often appeared to
me singular that the same Being who made us what
we are, should exact a duty from us, which before we
can perform, our nature must be changed. To keep

<!-- vol 1 page 195 -->

our hands, or even our tongues, from hurting an
enemy is easy; it is not difficult kindly to entreat
him; but to love him is beyond our power, and
the effort can only, as I think, lead to self-deception.
It is a violence to our nature, perhaps, even to return
benefits for injuries; to love those who have hurt us
seems little consistent with honesty, in the weakness
of our fallen nature; it seems so great a violence
done to our strongest feelings that we can hardly
hope to practise it, and may be tempted to feign
it even with ourselves, thus seduced into either
hypocrisy or self-deception. Possibly the divine
command is only an Oriental hyperbole, or rather
refers to our deeds and words (which are deeds) than
to our thoughts; possibly we should only read it as
an injunction to act as if we loved our enemies;
that we should hold out the hand of friendship and
loving kindness to them, should embrace them as
friends; and indeed to kiss, to give as it were the kiss
of peace, is one sense of the original Greek word.</p>

<p>" 'It is no deviation from my fundamental principle
that we should master and even smother our wrath
and our other violent passions; it would be a deviation
were it certain that the fire so covered would
still burn; but our nature is so constituted, that by

<!-- vol 1 page 196 -->

stifling we extinguish the lawless passions, which,
like fire, may be suppressed, and may burn the more
fiercely when uncovered to the air. This is true
even of our feelings: grief, for instance, may be
indulged so as to become extravagant and prey upon
the mind, while some alleviation of our sorrow may
be derived from avoiding the external display of it,
if to suppress it be impossible.</p>

<p>" 'Of course I entirely disapprove some practices
to which cunning men resort of concealing their
angry passions in order to gratify them the more
securely or the more effectually. I have known
some of this class who never took offence at the
moment; and, if attacked in society or in controversy,
defended themselves, but not even in self-defence
were much moved, and never retaliated as if
to avenge the attack. They bottled up their fury,
and let it loose on some occasion for which they lay
in wait, that they might spring, as it were, from the
thicket on their prey unwarily, and thus prevent any
one from perceiving what they did was in revenge for
having themselves been wounded. Women are of far
more sensitive and nimble minds than men, and
can better see through others. Their over-suspicious
nature no doubt often fancies things to be passing in

<!-- vol 1 page 197 -->

those they are inspecting, but also often hits on what
really is going on within our bosoms. Hence no such
stratagems as I am referring to ever deceive them;
they connect the attack with its cause; they see
into the thicket where resentment is lurking. This
clear-seeing of women has often astounded me, even
of women little remarkable for abilities. It seemed
as if their passions supplied force to their intellect,
and sharpened their wits. I have known a jealous
woman appear actually to know what passed within
the mind of her lover and her rival, as if she could
see through their breasts to scan their thoughts and
examine their designs.</p>

<p>" 'Men have discussed the question, whether or
not any circumstances, any extreme juncture, can
justify a breach of veracity. The dispute is really
about words; for when cases are figured to show
that a concealment of the truth, or even the assertion
of a falsehood, is lawful, we cannot say that any
obligation at all is broken. No one is bound to tell
an assassin which way his victim has escaped; no
one is bound to disclose the secret I have confided
to him because an impertinent person asks him;
and yet, in order to prevent him obtaining the information
which he has no right to, and which it is

<!-- vol 1 page 198 -->

a duty to withhold, you may be obliged to say No,
at once, and not to refuse an answer, because he may
so frame his question, that your refusal would be a
confession of the truth which you are bound to conceal.
The fault in these cases is not in you who
only refuse the information which it would be criminal
to give, but in the other party who asks you.
The violation of truth is, in fact, committed by the
assassin, who would make you an accomplice; or
the impertinent, who would make you break your
trust.</p>

<p>" 'If truth, and a sacred regard for it, must ever
be the corner-stone of our character, the superstructure
is to be reared, and the fabric maintained, by
firmness of purpose. This, indeed, consolidates and
strengthens the foundation itself; inasmuch, as a
constant regard for truth can hardly be preserved
amidst all temptations, unless our steadfastness be
guarded against the disturbing forces which are continually
acting upon us. How many miserable
wrecks of cast-away reputations do we see in all directions,
when the natural capacity was considerable,
the disposition kindly, the desire to do well reasonably
strong, but yet the firm and determined will
wanting: and the principles, originally sound and

<!-- vol 1 page 199 -->

good, were one by one sapped, and the whole
crumbled down! Consider how it happens, that a
life of secret indulgence is a life of falsehood and of
guilt. The passion thus gratified is the father of
lies, but their foster-father is fear, and to resist the
one, as well as be above the other, requires the
moral courage, without which no virtue can long be
found to flourish. When I trained my children, I
was as careful to shun whatever might expose them
to terror, as I was to remove any ordinary temptation
from their path. In early childhood the
habit of truth must be acquired, and whosoever is
severe to his child drives him to falsehood. Firmness
is to be taught by example, more than by
precept; and the parent who wavers himself in
his treatment infects the child with his weakness or
his caprice.</p>

<p>" 'Of pride, I know not well what to say as a
general rule; so closely is it allied to both great
virtues and great excesses. In so far as it prevents
mean actions, it is useful: and yet, it rather acts
thus as a substitute for a higher and more worthy
motive; it operates by the high and overweening
opinion of self. Many are saved by its influence,
whose principles are unsteady in other and better

<!-- vol 1 page 200 -->

respects. In itself, it cometh of evil, and often leads
to the worst actions, to want of charity, to intolerance,
to hardness of heart, even to cruelty; and
revenge is its natural fruit. When it prevents base
deeds, as doubtless it often does, we must regard it
as a compensatory principle in our machine; like
the parts of an engine which we sometimes see ingeniously
contrived to make its aberrations correct
themselves, and help the general movement by the
effects of a partial obstruction.</p>

<p>" 'Yet after all, what mischiefs come from this
same pride, and how little does it become a frail
creature like man! If it occasionally rescues us
from the degradation of a lie, does it not often reconcile
us to falsehood, for the sake of covering a weakness
that is no crime, and that no one needs be
ashamed of? Don't we daily see men persisting
in hurtful error, even on important subjects, rather
than freely own themselves to be in the wrong?
Even on the highest is this often seen. Does it not
obstruct the right and wholesome course of the
feelings, leading now to their suppression, now to
their perversion? How often do we see men
ashamed of being grateful; hating to incur obligation
for fear of being compelled to admit a

<!-- vol 1 page 201 -->

superior; and when the debt of gratitude has been
incurred, vainly, preposterously, thinking to pay it
off by fastening a quarrel on their benefactor! Oh!
no, there can be no balance in settling the account.
It is all on one side! The sin of the fallen angels
is not redeemed by the little good that ever results
from its indulgence. Vanity may make us more
ridiculous; pride makes us more hateful; and
they who to avoid contempt fear not encountering
hatred, they who say with the tyrant, "let me be
detested, so I be only dreaded, and not despised,"
are in imminent risk of incurring both inflictions,
and of being scorned as well as hated. Yet it is
more detestable than despicable: or rather our
laughter is lost in our indignation. When a Protestant
poet, I believe an Englishman, said that a
naked human heart is a sight so horrid, as only the
Deity can bear to look at, he surely must have had
in his eye the dreadful havoc that pride makes in
its structure.</p>

<p>" 'Nor is pride without an appointed punishment
here below. To suffer endless mortification; to have
the centre of action placed beyond our frame and
our power, and suffer for what others do or withhold;
to be harassed by suspicion&mdash;to be riven by

<!-- vol 1 page 202 -->

jealousy&mdash;to be vexed by a sense of wrong because
we have imagined a standard of injustice for ourselves;
to be pressed down by a feeling of injury
because we have set up a rule of justice&mdash;these are
among the sufferings which the indulgence of pride
inflicts; nor can its victim fail ever and anon to have
a misgiving that he is not very much consulting his
dignity in all he does, and all he feels; but, on
the contrary, is making himself most contemptible
to shun contempt. In this respect, no doubt, the
despicable folly of extreme vanity is far less painful
to its possessor; it may sometimes be mortified, but
it ministers, for the most part, rather to his contentment
than to his distress; while pride is almost
always the source of uneasiness and pain.</p>

<p>" 'Moderation in all our feelings, my young man,
should be cultivated as the parent of many virtues,
the protector against many vices. This is so trite
a subject that it will bear but two remarks. The
utter exhaustion we feel from a relapse into tranquillity
after a vehement excitement, is a paralysis
of the mind brought on by ourselves: it unhinges
us, and unfits us for all useful exertion, independent
of the pain it occasions. Then nothing so warps
the judgment as exaggerated feelings. Beware of

<!-- vol 1 page 203 -->

indulging either in violent friendships or strong
aversions: both are apt to drive us into the opposite
extremes. The most groundless dislikes that I have
ever seen succeeded to preposterous partialities; and
as often as I hear a person express unreasonable
hatred of another, I look forward to the day when,
blind to real imperfections, he will become devoted
to the object of his former antipathy.</p>

<p>" 'Akin to moderation, and growing out of it, is
the habit of economy; itself a virtue because connected
with justice and charity, and the mother of
other virtues, as well as the safeguard against many
evil ways. The danger of falling into the almost
insanity of parsimony and avarice must at the same
time be carefully shunned. The reason why men
are prone to indulge the love of mere saving arises
from their liking an enjoyment so entirely within
their own power, and under their individual control.
It also ministers to the love of security, removing
day by day all the fears which can ever invade the
mind of being needy or dependent.</p>

<p>" 'I have mentioned two simple tests of conduct,
as safe to be trusted; I must add a caution of sovereign
virtue as a preventative of misdeeds, because it
is levelled at the great corrupter, self-delusion. The

<!-- vol 1 page 204 -->

passions are of all sophists the most subtle; for they
not only turn away our eyes from the surrounding
perils, but blunt our sense of vision itself, so that we
could not see, were our eye pointed to the quarter
where the danger lies. But the worst of their sophistries
is directed against conscience itself, the judge
established in our own bosom by the Most High to
exercise his jurisdiction, both police and penal, both
preventive and vindictive. The sophistries I speak
of, practised on that judge, too often succeed in
swaying him over to their side. I will speak without
a figure on this most important matter. Beware
of the self-delusion which so often represents a
vengeful act as done in self-defence! How usual
is it for him who would gratify a feeling of vengeance
to say, "I am attacked and must protect
myself,"&mdash;for him who would profit at his neighbour's
expense to say, "I have been injured by
another, and must bring myself home,"&mdash;for him
who would gratify hatred to say, "He has wronged
me, and I have cause to dislike him;"&mdash;for him who
would fly in the face of the public opinion and insult
the general feeling to say, "All men scorn me, and
I must be at war with the world!" Be assured of
this, that it is easier by such sophistries to disarm

<!-- vol 1 page 205 -->

conscience of her terrors beforehand, than to quiet
her after guilt has been incurred from a neglect of
her warning voice; and the same power will be
found swift and stern to punish in proportion as it
has been impotent to deter.</p>

<p>"' Nor let me among the securities against vice,
pass over industry. The love of labour is a propensity
not unnatural to us, and it ought to be
cherished constantly, never repressed. Industry is
a great safeguard to the virtue of a frail being like
man, upon whose mind the wicked passions must
make fearful inroads while it has no innocent pursuit
wherewith to be occupied. But, independent of
the usefulness both to ourselves and others of labour,
independent of its being subservient to virtue;
its enjoyments are great, both in the exertion of
our faculties, and in the repose which succeeds that
exertion. I have myself tasted of these sweets; but
I have conversed with others whose lives were passed
in labours far more strenuous and unremitting than
my own. They have described with rapture the
exquisite delights of having finished a long task, of
being rewarded with delicious repose after fatiguing
toil, of sinking into tranquil rest after severe or agitating
efforts, of letting the mind slumber when the

<!-- vol 1 page 206 -->

body may be awake, or of so changing the line of
exertion as to give the faculties the same kind of
solace that the limbs experience by calling new
muscles into action. It is hardly needful to add
among the other virtues of great labour that there
is no other road to any kind of excellence. The
superficial impostors who would make us believe
they can by natural genius supply the want of
pains, and strike out great works at a heat, may
dazzle for a moment by doing badly and speedily,
what others of less quick parts do not much worse
in a longer time. But these works survive them
not. See the inimitable remains of ancient genius!
All is elaborated with a care quite equal
to the skill displayed. See the works of modern
art! The lyre, the chisel, the pencil, all are used
by the hand of intense labour. You will find
drawings even of the bones and joints by great
painters, Michael Angelo for instance, as accurate
as an anatomist could produce; and if the Venetian
school studied design less, it was only to bestow the
more pains upon the anatomy of colour and of expression;
while botanists themselves have admired
the accurate drawing and colouring of the foliage
in Titian's finest picture.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 207 -->

<p>" 'The course before you, my dear friend, is in all
human probability one that will only be traced through
the more private and obscure paths of life. If I believed
you were of that small number whose actions
could influence the destiny of their fellow-creatures,
whose fortunes are connected with the fate of nations,
I should have one hope to express, alike on their
account as on your own. Seek to raise monuments
which may give you not an imperishable name, but
a name that never can be pronounced without gratitude
and love; monuments which will endure, when
all that marble and brass can body forth shall have
crumbled in the dust&mdash;the improvement of your
kind in knowledge, in virtue, in happiness, the only
work worthy of a rational being, and the work
which alone can elevate man towards any resemblance
with his Divine Original!</p>

<p>" 'I close my parting advice with warning you
against the extremes of too easy faith and too rigid
incredulity. In the highest of all subjects you
have learnt from me the imprescriptible right, and
even the sacred duty of exercising your own reason.
But, though I would guard you against being tossed
about with every wind of doctrine, I would not have
you hastily reject the deliberate opinion of honest

<!-- vol 1 page 208 -->

and enlightened men, who have well considered
holy subjects. The weight of that opinion is great
with all rational minds, though it is not derived
from the authority of their station, or from their
illustrious names, unless in so far as their renown is
the reward bestowed by universal consent upon their
merits. Upon temporal matters you will steer a
safe course by pursuing the same middle path. The
most credulous persons are often those who have
occasion for confidence to their asseverations, and I
have often observed that ready liars are easy believers.
But, on the other hand, who will venture,
after what we have seen effected by science and by
art, to pronounce anything impossible? You need
not, even after beholding men sail in the air, and
pump up rivers by steam, or rend rocks by gunpowder,
believe that we shall ever live to see them
travelling by steam without horses, or sailing by
steam against the wind;<sup id="r010"><a href="#n010">10</a></sup> nor because we know how
respiration and combustion are performed, is it very
likely that we shall ever find out how the internal

<!-- vol 1 page 209 -->

structure and functions of our living bodies are influenced
by diseases; nor, because we now know many
new metals with strange qualities, are we likely ever
to see metals floating in the water and taking fire on
touching the air. Yet forget not that we have
already ascertained the great laws of planetary
motion, of chemical action, of animal life; and turn
not a deaf ear to any one that predicts the arrival
of a time when we shall be able to see that all
the apparent irregularities of the heavenly bodies,
from their mutual disturbances, are parts of one
necessarily harmonious system; that the mutual
actions of substances follow mechanical laws, and
their combinations observe definite proportions; and
that the movement of our muscles may be traced
to the nerves which connect them with the brain.
These are, possibly, dreams, but they import nothing
more marvellous than the existences which
science has already created, and they are certainly
more connected with the pleasures of refined
contemplation, the gratification of learned curiosity,
than with any use or any interest touching ourselves.</p>

<p>" 'But one inference powerfully strikes the mind
from considerations like these, and gives them the
closest connection with our very highest concerns.

<!-- vol 1 page 210 -->

If parts of the worldly system, which being once
placed beyond our reach, appeared disjointed, without
order, and without rule, now fall gradually
within the scope of the laws regulating the universe,
so that real harmony is found to arise out of apparent
discord, and absolute regularity to reign where
anarchy but yesterday seemed to revel&mdash;surely we
have a right to conclude, that when the film shall be
wholly removed from our eyes and we shall no
longer see as through a glass darkly, we shall find
what to our limited faculties now wears the aspect
of evil permitted by the Great Maker and Disposer,
is no longer entitled to the name, and that Perfect
Goodness reigns throughout the great system which
Perfect Wisdom has planned and Almighty Power
has created!' "</p>

<p>The Solitary ceased to read; and Chatillon, who
had listened with unabated attention to the philosophy
of the pastor, although it interrupted the
narrative and suspended the gratification of his curiosity,
confessed to himself that he had not passed
an unprofitable hour. Little used as he was to
deep reflection, and generally careless about anything
that did not immediately affect his senses, yet
the great interest excited by Albert's history, and

<!-- vol 1 page 211 -->

the affection he began to conceive for him, had led
to a wish that nothing should be withheld, had
made him engage his best attention in the story,
and now made him patient of a long and general, if
not somewhat abstract, discourse. Many things had
in the progress of it been presented to his mind in
lights which had never struck him before; many
things had been discussed on which his mind had
never dwelt at all; and he felt that he had listened
to what he afterwards called a kind of sermon, with
more profit and less weariness than he sometimes
felt at the Temple, when the Countess, educated
in Switzerland, and having a leaning in favour of
the Reformed worship, had made him occasionally
accompany her to that congregation. But Albert
now resumed the narrative of his own adventures.</p>

<p class="small">THE EXILE.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I retired</span> to rest full of serious but not unpleasing
reflections upon the important matters which I had
just during two hours and upwards committed to
paper from my recent recollections of the pastor's
discourse. I could, however, take but little and
interrupted sleep. The anxiety which filled my mind
respecting my own situation, the dark veil which
clouded the prospect around me to whatever point
I carried my view, above all, the thought that I
must now seek refuge in a foreign land, and quit,
most probably for ever, the neighbourhood of the
Cont&acirc;t, in which were my parents and my love&mdash;never
more to be cherished by my dear mother,
never more to cherish Louise&mdash;all this agitated and
dismayed me; the rather that during the perpetual
dread of detection in which I had been living at
Nismes, and my agony lest the innocent man should

<!-- vol 1 page 213 -->

suffer for my crime, I had not been able to have
these tender ideas present to my mind, and had
never been able to abstract it from the recollections
which occupied all my thoughts, unless at seasons
when the pastor administered consolation to me. and
led me to discuss the articles of the Catholic and
Apostolic faith, or the observances of the Romish
ritual. I was now about to be left altogether in
my own company, and my mind was accordingly
filled both with apprehension, for the future which
had never left it, and with musings on the past to
which it had for some weeks been comparatively a
stranger.</p>

<p>"Early in the next morning M. Gardein tenderly
embraced me, and pronounced his blessing with a
devout prayer for my welfare. He made his lad
take me to a vetturino, with whom he had agreed to
carry me as far as Beaucaire; and I arrived there
without any accident or any occurrence worth recounting.
There was no other passenger till we
got within a league of the town, when, to my infinite
consternation, I saw, coming up to take a place
in the carriage, a person whom I at once recognized
as having seen at Avignon, though I did not know
him; and it immediately struck me that he must

<!-- vol 1 page 214 -->

be on the look-out for me, and had received intimation
of my travelling by this vetturino. I drew
instinctively back, and ensconced myself in the darkest
corner at the back of the long clumsy vehicle.
To my no small relief, the man quietly drew out a
pipe, and began to strike a light and involve himself
in the clouds he exhaled, I took, however, the first
opportunity of leaving the carriage and passing
swiftly through Beaucaire, till, reflecting that my
walking quick might excite suspicion, as I had resumed
my peasant's dress, I slackened my pace,
and, buying some bread and some cheese, refreshed
myself for the journey before me. The road towards
Aix is uninteresting; I met very few people by the
way; and at night I slept in a small cabaret, where
they let me lie on the bench for a few sous. Next
day I arrived at Aix; and as I sat in an inn frequented
by muleteers, wishing to obtain a conveyance
or to accompany some one towards Dauphin&eacute;,
that I might get into Switzerland, I was inexpressibly
shocked to hear the conversation turn upon the
murder of Avignon, as it was called. The gross
exaggerations with which it was interlarded did not
prevent me from recognizing the portion of truth
on which the fabrication rested; and my heart sunk

<!-- vol 1 page 215 -->

within me when I heard that one of the criminals
had been secured on his flight towards Marseilles,
and was in the Papal prison at Avignon, where he
had been condemned to the rack. I gave a convulsive
start, and well nigh shrieked to think of Isidore.
It now seemed as if all eyes must be upon me; but
so frantic did I become at the thoughts of my dear
companion suffering for me, that I little regarded
my own situation, and was prepared to go back and
surrender myself, when a remark that escaped respecting
money having been found in the prisoner's
girdle made me conceive the hope that the whole
was a mistake of the police proceeding at Nismes.
This relieved my anxiety for the moment, but I
could not leave Aix under the uncertainty; I went
to a place were the Avignon Gazette could be
read; and as I found nothing in it except an account
of the Nismes proceeding and the escape of
the prisoner, my alarm was quieted.</p>

<p>"I now took the road to Sisteron, in order to arrive
at Grenoble. The further I removed from the
Cont&acirc;t, I felt that my fears became less strong, and
I could even enjoy the magnificent scenery and the
fine weather, neither too sultry nor at all chilly,
which the season, though advanced to the very end

<!-- vol 1 page 216 -->

of autumn, gave. When the mind is in an agitated
or a melancholy state, there is something peculiarly
mournful in the serene aspect of a sunny sky, and
the tranquil beauty of a fine landscape, such as
many of the valleys near the Durance and the Is&egrave;re
present. The contrast is striking between what is
felt within and seen without; but the thought which
prevails when our affliction rests upon the loss of
those most beloved, or upon an uncertainty as to
their fate, is that we refer to them the surrounding
objects.&mdash;'Shall the dear Father Jerome ever more
open his eyes beaming with kindness on this glorious
sun? It rises as formerly when we have
walked forth in the cool of the morning to contemplate
together the works of the Creator, and when
the father's learning taught how that light was
composed, which clothes all nature in varied hues. It
sets as formerly when we have gone out to meditate
at eventide, and when his lessons taught me that
the reflection on a well-spent day is more serene
than the summer heavens as night comes on, and
the beauties of virtue dazzle more than the sparkles
in the starry firmament. Yes, it rises and sets;
lighting men to their labours, or suggesting to them
their needful repose; but on the holy friar's grave

<!-- vol 1 page 217 -->

it sheds in vain its rays; for him there is no alternation
of seasons; it is dark always: it is cold the
year through; the warmth of that heart is extinguished
which so long glowed with love of God and
man, and the gentle light of that eye is quenched,
which shone with intelligence and glistened with
tenderness! Whose impious hand laid the venerable
Father low? Does he&mdash;can he bear yet
to live, and live even to be filled with anxious
fear about the burden of the vile life he carries
about, not daring to shake off his hated existence?
Then can I be sure of that being the last crime
which rests on my loaded conscience, and should
bend down my guilty head? Is it certain after all
that Isidore has not fallen a sacrifice to my escape?
His friendship, which made him my accomplice by
aiding my concealment and sharing in my flight,
has exposed him to the risk of capture; and am I
sure that in my absence he has not become an expiatory
offering for my sacrilege?'&mdash;It seemed as
if a second time within a few weeks I had involuntarily
the guilt of blood upon me, by the blow
which I had wilfully and wickedly designed for
others having fallen upon those I most would have
desired to spare. Such were the reflections with

<!-- vol 1 page 218 -->

which I cast my eyes on the magnificent landscape
that is spread from the Is&egrave;re by Vizille, as far as
the sight can reach, terminated by the Swiss Alps.
It opened upon me in a fine setting sun, as I came
round the point between La Mure and La Freye.
There are few more striking or more noble prospects
to be seen. A vast and cultivated plain
stretches to an immense distance in front, with two
considerable towns in the foreground, and studded
with villages and farm-houses as far as the eye can
reach, Vizille is romantic from its fine buildings;
and to gain La Freye, you have to cross the Is&egrave;re
on a handsome and spacious bridge. The Drax
rolls on in ample flood below Grenoble to the
left, and that fine city stands on an eminence
which commands the champaign country on either
side of the rapid stream. The Higher Alps, on
whose chain is the Grande Chartreuse, rise behind
it at a moderate distance, and the view on the other
side is closed by the lofty mountains of Switzerland,
among which the glaciers are seen to tower
in the severe majesty of eternal snow, the loftiest of
the whole, Mont Blanc, losing its purple summit
in the clouds. This magnificent spectacle for the
moment distracted my thoughts from melancholy

<!-- vol 1 page 219 -->

contemplations, and I cast a wistful eye to the time
when I used to visit new scenery, light of heart, and
indulge in day-dreams of other excursions and
other contemplations with those I loved and should
see no more.</p>

<p>"As the sun sank, behind the lower chain to the
west, I entered the fortifications of Grenoble, and
could not help feeling a shudder when I found
myself surrounded with the force of the place. It
seemed as if each soldier was ready to stop and
to execute justice on one who was fleeing from it.
I buried myself in a low inn, frequented by Swiss
cattle-dealers, and at once saw how unlike my dress
was to either those persons or any one in the Grenoble
country. My alarm was increased by a
servant-girl of the cabaret remarking that I neither
seemed to speak like the French nor the Swiss. So
I stole out of the inn and took shelter in another,
where, happily, I passed without observation. Next
morning I sallied forth to find my way up the
mountains; and observing a crowd in the public
place, I safely mixed in it, all being so deeply intent
on something which was passing upon a stage
erected near, that none thought of regarding me at
all. But what was my horror, my unspeakable dismay,

<!-- vol 1 page 220 -->

to see that the object all thus gazed on was an
execution! The priests were administering the last
rites of the church to the unhappy culprit, a young
man of most forbidding aspect, and rude, savage
mien, against whom the feelings of the multitude
seemed strongly excited. I would have given worlds
to be at a distance from the accursed spot, but I
felt as rivetted to it; and my agony of mind was
severely increased when I saw the preparations for
the rack before the sentence of death should be
executed. I had heard those around recounting
the particulars of his crime with horror; but this
feeling was soon to undergo a great and a sudden
change. When stretched on the terrible wheel, his
screams filled the air, and were echoed by the indignant
spectators. True, he had committed a
cruel murder! the murder of a working man in the
neighbouring wood for the lucre of gain, that he
and his comrades, of a gay night, might spend the
poor traveller's money, the price of his summer's
labours in the Grenoble forest, with which he was
hastening home to support his little family, widowed
and made orphans by his fate. True, all this was
well known, and had been preached upon in the
sermons of the friars ever since the condemnation.

<!-- vol 1 page 221 -->

as well as promulgated in the proclamation of the
sentence by the magistrates. True, the murdered
peasant had long been well known as frequenting
the vicinity of the town, and respected for his orderly
and quiet demeanour, as well as for his
unwearying industry, so that his death had been
bewailed, and the public anxiety, till the murderer
was discovered, had been wound up to a high pitch,
making the discovery the subject of general exultation;
and, if a less cruel punishment had been
inflicted, even a capital punishment, all sympathy
would have been interested on the side of justice.
But the sanguinary, the unmerciful spectacle, of
agony beyond the power of human endurance, deliberately
inflicted by the officers of the law, obliterated
all recollection, even the strongest and the
most fresh, from the minds of the assembled thousands;
all their feelings were perverted; they had
only sympathy with the sufferer whose contortions
they saw before them, whose shrieks and groans
rent the air; and if they could find a place in their
bosoms for any other feeling, it was for indignation
against the merciless law, which, execrating for its
needless and revolting cruelty, they unjustly accused
also of violating all justice. The criminal

<!-- vol 1 page 222 -->

had changed places with the murdered man, and
become the object of public compassion; the law
had taken the place of the crime, and was the object
of detestation. Their feeling was to rescue the
suffering culprit, and wreak their vengeance on the
ministers of justice.</p>

<p>"I have often since reflected on this exhibition of
popular feeling, and drawn from it the conclusion
that such must ever be the effect of punishments
which, either from being disproportioned to the
offence, or from being of a kind needlessly cruel
and revolting, fail to carry the public feelings along
with them; and I have further felt persuaded from
the savage spirit which I saw excited at Grenoble,
that sanguinary punishments have a tendency to prepare
criminals rather than repress crime by habituating
to cruel sights the minds of the vulgar, uneducated,
and acting from blind impulse. But such
reflections were not the suggestions of that moment;
I could then only think of the terrible scene before
me; I felt as if each turn of the wheel was destined
for my own limbs; I seemed as if doomed by Providence
to a foretaste of the fate which awaited me.
The finishing stroke, the <i>coup de grace</i>, was at length
allowed to terminate the wretch's agony, and relieve

<!-- vol 1 page 223 -->

the spectators as well as the principal sufferer;
it seemed to terminate my bodily and my far less
tolerable mental sufferings; and when the black
pall was flung over the wheel on which the murderer's
body lay stretched, I for the moment, could
hardly avoid envying him his last, perhaps his first
repose, as I hastened away from the dreadful scene,
scarce conscious of what I did, and wholly careless
whither I went.</p>

<p>"My state of mind while winding through the
Alpine passes I cannot well describe, for I could
think of nothing but the Public Place at Grenoble,
and could only see the horribly distorted face of the
tortured murderer. But this I remember, that I
shunned the path which leads to the Grande Chartreuse,
feeling alarmed at any approach to a monastery.
After several days of suffering, caused by
the cold, which had set in like winter in these
elevated regions, I at length came in sight of
the frontier, and reflected that I had no passport.
Ignorant whether it was a Catholic or a Protestant
canton that I was about to enter, I durst not say I
had become a convert to the Reformed faith and
was flying from persecution; and I could think of no
other means of escape from the police of the boundaries

<!-- vol 1 page 224 -->

than waiting till night fell, sauntering on
the unfrequented road, and then clambering up to
some height on the mountain at the peril of falling
over a precipice. Fortunately I found a hut in
which sheep had been driven for shelter against the
cold, and I contrived with the aid of their warmth
to pass the night, one of the most dismal I had
known since my escape. Next morning I found
myself among a race of peasants different from
those I had seen any where in France, and I
breathed freely on being assured that I had altogether
escaped from my native country.</p>

<p>"I did not, however, venture to linger long on the
frontier; I gradually made my way through the
canton, reached the Lake of Geneva, and before
November set in, which in these parts of the world
is completely established winter, I had got as far as
the neighbourhood of Vevay, on the upper part of
the Leman lake.</p>

<p>"The country there is exceedingly fine, but I
found the winter severe. What made the life more
vexatious was the difficulty I found in obtaining
work, for my only resource was day labour in the
fields. I was afraid to seek employment as a clerk,
or shopman, or any capacity showing education,

<!-- vol 1 page 225 -->

lest I should betray my secret. Even among peasants
I ran, or constantly felt that I ran, a risk of
discovery. After I had been some time in a farm-house
about a league from the town, taking care
of the cattle and stables, a work which I certainly
must have done very indifferently, I was one morning
alarmed by a man who slept in the same room,
and whom I observed looking very attentively at my
bed while he thought me still asleep. I did not
move, and I observed that he went to the door, and
whispered to another, a servant-girl who was passing.
They both came and gazed. I then perceived
to my great alarm that it was at the whiteness
of my skin they were wondering, one hand
and arm lying over the bed-clothes as I slept or
seemed to sleep. They stood wondering, and
looked attentively at me and at each other. Afraid
of awakening me, they stole away, and I heard them
whisper something on leaving the room, as if they
remarked on the language I spoke. All this was
enough, and more than enough, to rouse my fears,
and I resolved to go further from the town. But
the day being Sunday, I determined to go there once
before I left the neighbourhood, in order to see at
dusk in the coffee-house or reading-room whether

<!-- vol 1 page 226 -->

there was any mention made of news from Avignon.
The first paragraph that struck my eye fixed me to
the spot. My having been at Nismes was mentioned
as a prevailing rumour, but probably connected
with the police proceeding, and it was said that the
daughter of a respectable family, the cause of the
whole, though she did not accompany my flight, had
since left the Cont&acirc;t and taken refuse in the Protestant
city. The editor or news-writer indulged in
severe remarks on the intrigues of the Reformers,
and deemed it a duty incumbent on the government
of the most Christian king to purge the land of their
pastors, as his ancestor of pious memory had done a
century ago.</p>

<p>"I now removed to some distance from Vevay,
and sought employment on the opposite side of the
lake near St. Gingoulph. On revolving the report,
and reflecting upon the likelihood of Louise, who
was clearly the person meant, leaving the Cont&acirc;t, it
appeared very probable she should have heard of my
going to Nismes, as the good pastor had informed
my family of my retreat. I therefore ventured to
write to him, and, putting no name to my letter, I informed
him where I was, beseeching him to give me
any information he could as to poor Louise. Day

<!-- vol 1 page 227 -->

after day I went to the post-office in hope of receiving
his answer; and after a month had elapsed, I
was mortified beyond expression to see my letter
stuck up as not having been forwarded, for want of
the postage required in the case of letters going out
of the canton. I durst not pay it; because, forgetting
how many of the peasants in these countries can
read and write, I was fearful my being able to do so
might excite suspicion, as it inevitably would in
France. But a fellow servant taking his own letter
one day shewed me my mistake, and I franked
mine over the frontier. Another period of anxious
expectation now succeeded, and when I asked for
letters directed to Paul Meyer, I was somewhat
roughly asked by the post-mistress, if I was a German,
as I spoke a kind of French, I said I came
from Alsace, and was no longer molested.</p>

<p>"The Swiss are a people of rude manners, who
possibly on that account get credit for more honesty
than they really have. They are exceedingly selfish,
and, though not capable of the trickery for which
the Italians are famed, will go a good way from the
straight path to serve their own ends. They have,
I think, less warmth of heart than the Germans, as
they also have less grossness. In some parts of the

<!-- vol 1 page 228 -->

country, as Geneva, Lausanne, Neufchatel, they are
sufficiently civilized, and show much aptitude for
literary and even scientific pursuits. But their
genius is not original; they are good at abridging
and explaining; they have the gift of didactic
faculties in rather an eminent measure; they are
good also at pursuing minutely and into their details
the discourses and the theories of more enlarged
and original minds; but they are themselves of a
narrow and petty intellect. If, however, their genius
is confined, their self-sufficiency is on a very large
scale; no people are better pleased with themselves,
nor more easily satisfied with their own performances.
This complacent temper extends from the
qualities to the possessors. They regard their little
country as the eye of Europe, and their paltry
affairs as of incalculable importance. Their manners
have the tinge of their contracted understandings,
and of their selfish dispositions. They are pedantic
in the extreme; the word <i>pr&eacute;cieux</i> (priggish) seems
to have been invented for their especial use; they
are also most regular and orderly, being of cold passions
as well as sluggish feelings; method is their
god. I used to think they always did the same
things, and almost said the same things, at the

<!-- vol 1 page 229 -->

same hour every day. Their mirth is of a mournful
caste; it is dulness thrown into action; so that
I can well comprehend what the witty Bishop of
Autun is reported to have said when asked if Geneva
was not rather dull, 'Yes, particularly in its gaieties'
(<i>Oui, surtout quand on s'y amuse</i>). I saw little
of the upper classes, until a subsequent visit; but
the peasantry, among whom I lived, are a simple,
though a somewhat rude and abundantly selfish
people. They are much attached to their country,
and have credit for more love of liberty than they
can with any truth pretend to, all they care for
being their own institutions; and those of the aristocratic
cantons are just as much attached to their
slavish customs as the inhabitants of the democratic
states are to their free government. They are all
brave, however, and I believe would make a stout
resistance with their rifles and their stones or rocks,
were any foreign power to invade their valleys.
The upper classes, even in the most democratic
parts, are fonder of rank and value themselves on
antiquity of family more than any people I ever saw.</p>

<p>"After some weeks of farther anxiety and suspense,
I at length, when I asked for Paul Meyer's
letters, had one put into my hand in the dear old

<!-- vol 1 page 230 -->

pastor's handwriting. Who can depict my agitation
as I ran home with it in my bosom, building a
thousand castles in the air, all inhabited by Louise
Orange; but now and then harassed with fears of
some sinister accident having befallen her, or those
whom I so dearly loved at home! I stole into a
light granary of the farm-house, and closing the door,
laid the letter before me, dreading to open it, and
dissipate my visions or realize my fears. The state
of the seal immediately caught my eye; it had been
broken, it was plainly cut across with some sharp
instrument, and its parts were clumsily joined.
Thus, satisfied that other eyes had seen the contents,
I read them with the most feverish anxiety; and
though no names were mentioned, yet if the same
hands had opened and the same eyes read mine to
M. Gardein, it must be known that the 'young
man' meant Louise, and the 'Hospital' meant the
monastery. The alarm which this reflection naturally
excited did not prevent me from devouring the good
pastor's few lines, in which he informed me that the
friars were as vigorous as ever in their search after
me; that he had written to make his brother-in-law,
and intimate friend, a clergyman near St. Meurice,
between that and St. Gingoulph, receive me as his

<!-- vol 1 page 231 -->

guest; and that from him I should learn more respecting
all in whom I took most interest. I hastened to
M. Girard's house, the spot pointed out, in the dusk,
fortunately as the event proved; for the next day
two persons strongly suspected of belonging to the
French embassy at Zurich arrived at the farm where
I had been working, and enquiring first for one Paul
Meyer, and then for a person lately arrived from
France, left no doubt as to my being the object of
their search. I was thus compelled to confide a
portion of my history to M. Girard, who provided
me with an entirely new disguise, that of a clergyman;
but I took the precaution of disguising my
face with red whiskers, and wearing a pair of green
spectacles."</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p class="small">THE HOUSE OF MOURNING.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">M. Girard</span> was a very worthy man, far advanced
in life, of venerable presence, of silent and reserved
manners, a model of piety to his flock, and abounding
in charitable dispositions; but he was both of a contracted
mind compared with M. Gardein, had not
any knowledge of the world like him, and gave
little pleasure in his social intercourse. He excelled
in the discharge of his pastoral duties. To his
people he was kind and attentive, distributing among
them the savings of an extremely poor income, and
often relieving from absolute want the labourers who
could at all times with such difficulty find employment,
that work was run after, and canvassed for,
and distributed among them as places of profit may
be in more happy and easy communities. How I
have seen the clerk after service on a Sunday, taking
the poor working-people aside into the porch and

<!-- vol 1 page 233 -->

communicating with an air of importance, a patronizing air,
what they heard with delight and scarcely
could believe to be true, that in the course of a day
or two a new wall would be built, not above a league
off, and some ground cleared for planting, which
would give a month's employment to fourteen or
fifteen men!<sup id="r011"><a href="#n011">11</a></sup> They went home blessing Heaven for
mercies so plenteously showered down upon them,
and well convinced that in no country under the sun
did more real felicity reside than among the Alps.
M. Girard on such occasions never failed to improve
their pious and contented feelings, and to draw a
moral of patience and submission to the Divine will
when things should wear a less smiling aspect.</p>

<p>"To see this good man in his most attractive
aspect, it was necessary to go, not into his society or
even his study, for his learning was small, but to be
among his congregation on a Sunday. His aged
aspect had a truly venerable air; his silver hair
scantily covered a high and arched forehead, in which
his eyes were sunk deep; his countenance was expressive,
benevolent, but perfectly serious; his action,
extremely simple, was yet not without the graces of
a natural manner occasionally warmed with his subject;

<!-- vol 1 page 234 -->

he spread his hands over his flock as if he would
gather them under his wing and protect them from
the blast of sin, or the blight of unbelief; his voice
was sonorous, but generally of sufficient harmony;
and at times when he exerted it, as in preaching a
funeral or other occasional sermon, there was something
peculiarly touching in his earnest simplicity.
But one method he had of being impressive, of
commanding attention, and creating the deepest
silence&mdash;when coming to a passage intended to be
striking and effective, he did not speak loud, but
dropped his voice suddenly, and threw it out with extraordinary
distinctness indeed, but only in a loud
whisper. The effect of this was such as I never remember
to have seen equalled in any other preacher
or speaker. Another thing I also remarked in his
preaching. When he would handle any pathetic
subject, as on occasion of a funeral, his topics were
all of the plainest, most ordinary, even homely kind,
and his language the most simple and unadorned:
the impression on the feelings which his discourse
produced was in consequence very great. He used
few notes; preparing himself diligently both by
reading, meditation, and prayer, in which he
devoutly engaged for some time before going to his

<!-- vol 1 page 235 -->

church. But his sermons were the fruit of study,
and not the wild effusions of extemporary fancy, or
undisciplined enthusiasm. He had nothing at all
fanatical in his composition; and though his knowledge
was confined, it embraced the two great subjects
which it most imports the preacher to know,
the Sacred Writings and the human heart. He
had the gift of searching both, as both had been
the study of his long life. Though his occasional
discourses might be more striking, I confess
the ministrations in which he has produced
upon me the greatest effect were his ordinary distributing
of the Sacrament of the Supper, and
his reading the Burial Service. He gave the former
with his wonted simplicity; and I was greatly impressed
with a practice which he had, I believe,
himself introduced&mdash;he read with a solemn voice
the Ten Commandments, laid down the book which
he had held up, and then took the Elements in his
hands. The effect was solemn beyond anything I
can describe. I never saw him lift before his face
the broad volume of inspired truth, and turn toward
the congregation, without awe; and I felt a thrill
through my whole frame when he said with a clear,
loud, and authoritative voice, 'God spake all these

<!-- vol 1 page 236 -->

words and said, I am the Lord thy God! Thou
shalt have none other Gods but me.'</p>

<p>"The deep sorrow of which I tasted so largely
while under his quiet roof, and which made me
wholly forget my troubles and dangers, has mournfully
impressed on my mind the recollection of all
that there passed around me, nor is the remembrance
so unpleasing as might be supposed. I know not if
I be constituted as others are made, but I have a
strange hankering after recollections of the past; and
no sooner has any portion of my existence become
shadowed over in the mist of distance, than I look back
upon it with a pleasing emotion, as if wistful that it
were renewed. Even when I have been at the time
most miserable, nay, while I have the distinct recollection
of my hours having then been spent far less
comfortably than the ones actually flying over my
head, yet still it seems enough that they should be
the past hours, that their events should have sunk
into the shade of distance, and their pains, or their
perils, or their languor, only live in the memory, for
me to regard them with regret, and sigh for their
return with an unavailing and unintelligible fondness.
It is this feeling that in part makes me take
some pleasure in recounting to you my history, and

<!-- vol 1 page 237 -->

overcomes a reluctance which I might otherwise
feel to dwell on a retrospect of so much sorrow. I
pursue my narrative.</p>

<p>"I had not been many days at M. Girard's when
he took me into his study, and communicated the
information that Louise had set out from Nismes to
pass the spring, now beginning to break, with his
granddaughter who lived with him, and was a plain
but not unpleasing girl of about eighteen. Whoever
has been suffered, beyond his hopes, to escape
from a prison to which he saw no end, whoever has
been restored to health by some sudden change,
after he had been given over, and told to prepare for
death, can conceive, none others well can, the sudden
change in all my feelings, thoughts and prospects
which the intelligence produced. I had only
power to ask if she knew I was at St. Gingoulph;
but I was told she did not; and that it was probable
she never would have consented to come had she
been apprised of it; for she was a rigid Catholic,
and, having heard of my conversion, had, though
with a severe struggle, done violence to her feelings,
and dismissed me from her thoughts, as if the revolution
in my state and my sentiments, which had
truly removed the chief impediment to our union,

<!-- vol 1 page 238 -->

had raised up between us an impassable barrier.
There was no reasoning with her on this point, M.
Girard said; for as he justly observed, it is unfortunate,
that on the most momentous of all subjects,
that of religion, men seldom reason at all, they only
feel. However, I was young, and sanguine, and I
awaited her arrival with inexpressible anxiety. She
came at length, and I thought she was more beautiful
than ever. Through my thick disguise, she at
once recognized me, and her salutation was perfectly
friendly, though it betokened feelings far different
from the rapture that filled my bosom, and that she
aforetime had also shared. She was calm and she
was melancholy; she frankly avowed to me the state
of her sentiments; declared her fixed resolution; assured
me that had she known I was under M. Girard's
roof, or in his neighbourhood, she never would have
given me the pain or herself the uneasiness of coming;
and finally, begged me to believe that, as she
was inflexible in her determination, I must not only
avoid any allusion whatever to our former intimacy,
but frequent her society as little as it was possible to
do in a very small house. Hope is strong when
man is young, and though cast down I did not
despair; but I own that the extreme calmness of her

<!-- vol 1 page 239 -->

whole demeanour, the little effect produced on her
by the surprise of finding me at St. Gingoulph, above
all the extreme devotion to the observances of the
Catholic faith, which I soon found had taken fast
hold of her mind, and literally filled her whole time,
did give me very painful apprehensions; these soon
were crowned with an alarm from the intimations of
her young friend, who though a Protestant had been
educated at a convent in Avignon, where her father
lived, and had a leaning towards Romanism, which
she concealed from her grandfather, though she saw
very frequently the Romish priest of St. Meurice,
that Louise herself had serious thoughts of taking the
veil. This, it seems, had become a favourite plan
of Louise after my flight and conversion; it had
become a resource in her hours of sorrow; and it
fully accounted for her calmness on meeting me and
her generally altered demeanour. Emilie, I found,
had no such thoughts, nor, indeed, had she yet quitted
the Protestant faith.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, the time passed with me very differently
from anything I had been accustomed to
since I left Avignon, and one effect of the passion
which now became once more my master, was that
it absorbed all other feelings, and left little room for

<!-- vol 1 page 240 -->

even the fears that were unavoidably incident to my
situation. To this passion, too, fresh fuel was daily
administered; I saw and conversed with Louise,
though always in the presence of Mdlle. Emilie
Fonrose. We generally sat in her little room,
where her books, her work, her beads, her crucifixes,
and her little caskets of relics, were tastefully
arranged; having no other instrument in that small
and frugal household, Emilie used to sing and play
on a small guitar; her grandfather had given her
one of the musical boxes made at Geneva, which
played the three tunes she most admired. It was one
of her simple and innocent relaxations to set these
playing after she had fatigued herself with work;
and she had a little bird which sang so sweetly that
we would sit for a length of time to hear its warbling.
With this enchanting Louise, and her amiable
friend, the hours flew swiftly away; and the summer
came on with all the loveliness of an Alpine climate.
Emilie, indeed, was herself a person of very great
merit. Without the least pretensions to beauty,
she was pleasing in her expression of countenance,
of simple and even graceful manners, of the most
mild and placid temper I have ever known, and of a
calm and unerring good sense which would in any

<!-- vol 1 page 241 -->

one have made a profitable exchange if bartered for
more showy qualities. Her humble sense of her
own merits, her constantly preferring others to herself
in all matters from the greatest to the most
trifling, her quiet, retiring demeanour, which only
let her come forward into notice when drawn out
from her modest retreat, made her a favourite with
all that approached her. Her benevolence was unbounded,
and though almost as poor as many of the
objects of her bounty, she would deny herself every
thing that bore the remotest resemblance to indulgence,
in order to taste what she relished far more,
the delights of charity. Her small pecuniary means
failing, she would take bread to give when a family
was perishing for want of work; and when she
could not in any way help the poor, it was one of
her choicest recreations in hard weather to feed the
poor little birds that flocked round her, and showed
by their chirping and flapping their wings, that they
knew their kind protectress as soon as she walked
into the garden. She formed the only link which
now connected her grandfather with this world, and
he was wont to say that, should it ever please Providence
to take her from him, his earthly career
was closed.</p>

<!-- vol 1 page 242 -->

<p>"To be so many months in the society of Emilie
Fonrose, without feeling deeply penetrated with her
virtues, and touched with the incomparable sweetness
of her disposition, was impossible. There was even
something inexpressibly affecting in the poverty, not
squalid, even not inelegant, that reigned through
the pastor's small establishment. I have often felt
moved with the innocent joy of this artless girl,
when she had secretly saved a few sous, and laid
them out in purchasing a little tea, a luxury unknown
in the ordinary fare of the parsonage. She
would then invite her grandfather and me to partake
of this treat in her room. It might have made
the hard and silly muscadins of Paris or of Nismes
smile to see what only drew tears from my eyes;
the kind of pride with which she would do the
honours of her frugal feast, and the little air of
patronage and of consequence which she seemed to
wear, as a great lady might dispensing a nobler
repast. If the good pastor's mind had not been
far removed above worldly objects, the feeling
which then filled him would probably have been
that of repining that his child was not shining in
a higher sphere, worthy of being adorned by her.
But he seemed to think more justly, and more contentedly;

<!-- vol 1 page 243 -->

and as he was, though of dry if not hard
exterior, yet of a warm and even tender heart, it
was easy to see his eye glistening with delight at
marking the pleasure she seemed to enjoy.</p>

<p>"There is an indissoluble connection between
all the feelings of the heart, as much as among
the vessels that circulate its blood through our
frames. Not to have felt my brotherly affection
for Emilie ripen into love, had Louise been taken
from me, would, I verily think, have been impossible.
Shall I own it? This idea began to pass
through my mind as she persevered in forbidding
all renewal of the subject which she had at first
proscribed; and Emilie became, naturally, the confidant
of the affliction which this, coupled with the
sad prospect of the nunnery ever before my eyes,
occasioned. But it pleased the Great Disposer to
order otherwise than that any such end of my intercourse
with her should arrive.</p>

<p>"In order to make some small purchases for the
summer, and to see an old friend of her deceased
mother, married to the English chaplain, Emilie
went to Geneva; and I, as well as Louise, accompanied
her. We stayed over the Sunday, and attended
the English service; we all understood the

<!-- vol 1 page 244 -->

language well enough to admire that noble liturgy;
Louise greatly preferred it to the simple Calvinistic
ritual she had heard at St. Gingoulph. Alas! we
were fated soon to hear a more striking portion of
that fine service. After the sermon was over, we
looked at the monuments; and Emilie said to the
old clergyman, she should like to be buried there;
but Louise would not allow that it could be called
consecrated ground. Next day, we were invited to
join a water-party on the lake, given by a family
that lived near Secherons, about half-a-league from
the town. A young English sea-officer must needs
shew his naval skill by taking charge of the boat,
and, for some time, he succeeded well enough, the
breeze being steady. But the boatmen, accustomed
to the squalls which are common to all lakes surrounded
by unequal and abrupt heights, repeatedly
warned, and warned him in vain, not to trust his
maritime experience, which would here assuredly
fail him. In trying to double a point, we met a
sudden change of wind, which at once upset the
boat. I rushed towards Louise, whom one of the
men succeeded in saving; but poor Emilie sank to
rise no more. The officer himself paid the forfeit
of his rashness, for though he kept himself afloat,

<!-- vol 1 page 245 -->

the rudder of the boat, as the men were righting
her, struck him, and he sank in deep water. The
boatmen saved the rest of the party.</p>

<p>"It would be in vain to describe the horror and
dismay of Louise, when she came to understand
her loss, after being herself rescued from a watery
grave. I did not feel less the bitterness of grief,
but my relief on Louise's escape, which I had supposed
impossible, broke the force of the heavy blow.
The body of the ill-fated Emilie was conveyed to
the inn at Secherons; and I went immediately back
to St. Gingoulph, as fast as a char-au-banc could
take me, that I might break to the wretched old
man the intelligence of this sad disaster.</p>

<p>"I found him just risen from his solitary meal,
and having returned thanks in presence of his maid-servant,
whom I begged to quit the room. My
sudden appearance, unaccompanied, at once revealed,
as well as my faltering manner, that I was the messenger
of evil tidings, and he calmly breathed a
prayer, 'God's will be done.' Though thus partly
prepared for it, on learning the truth he was struck
dumb, and could not weep. He grasped my arm
in his long and bony hand; he looked almost vacantly
in my face as if to seek some mitigation of the

<!-- vol 1 page 246 -->

cruel blow; he found no comfort there; and he
breathed out a disconsolate prayer, or rather a reluctant
and compulsory admission that His will
must be done and His name be blessed, who giveth
and who taketh away.</p>

<p>"It seemed to soothe him when I proposed that
he should accompany me back to Secherons, and
attend the last solemnities due to poor Emilie. We
arrived there late at night; and found Louise had
given the necessary directions with great firmness
and presence of mind. Before retiring to rest the
ancient pastor desired to see for the last time the
loved remains of his child; but we dissuaded him,
as deeming that it might break that sleep he stood
so much in need of, and which sorrow, by a merciful
dispensation of Providence, has rather a tendency
to bestow than to withhold, provided no undue excitement
interrupts it. The next day was passed in
dismal affliction, and as night fell, just before our
family worship, he required us to accompany him
to the chamber of death.</p>

<p>"The coffin lay upon a bed, and the face of Emilie
was exposed full to our view, by the light of the
tapers that burnt gloomily round the room. The
calm expression of countenance was strikingly different

<!-- vol 1 page 247 -->

from the distorted features of agony and alarm I had
last seen while she was struggling in the water; all had
now relapsed into unbroken tranquillity, as if pain,
and fear, and sorrow were now and for ever no more.
There was nothing frightful, nothing repulsive in
the sight; on the contrary, there was a peculiar
sweetness in her placid features, which wore an air
even of beauty that had never before been perceived.
A kind of fine transparent hue, though pale, seemed
graceful; and the long lashes appeared to pronounce
that the eyes were but closed in sleep, though the
sleep was to endure for evermore. The dreadful
idea, however, soon shrouded the mind, 'You see
her for the last time!' The pastor softly, as if he
feared to disturb her eternal slumber, approached
the bed, and fixed a last kiss upon her cold forehead,
but still he could not weep. For a whole day
and night his grief had been unmitigated by tears;
no refreshment had his parched eyelids bestowed on
his suffering; and we quitted the chamber, throwing
the last look behind upon its lifeless occupant. In
the room below, to which we withdrew, the reverend
old man prayed fervently to the Father of all for
grace and for comfort, and that it would please Him
to sustain us in this cruel bereavement wherewithal

<!-- vol 1 page 248 -->

He had seen good to visit us. As he closed his
prayer a noise fell on our ears, as of screwing
some board or other sounding body; instantly the
idea flashed through our minds&mdash;it was the closing
of Emilie's coffin. As if his prayer had been
heard the old man now wept aloud, and all unused
to such tender scenes, he sank into Louise's
arms.</p>

<p>"Next day the funeral took place, and in the
English chapel, where, with a prophetic warning of
her fate, she had desired to be buried. As the body
slowly descended the staircase, the pastor stood reverently
with his head uncovered, leaning on my
arm for a needful support. We followed in a mourning
carriage to the town, of which the gate or wicket
was first shut and then opened to let us pass onwards.
The simple procession arrived at the church-yard.
It was here met by Emilie's venerable
friend, the English clergyman arrayed in his white
vestment. I never had witnessed this solemnity,
which I never shall forget. Meeting the corpse as
it was slowly borne along, he uttered with a solemn
but tremulous voice,&mdash;'I am the resurrection and the
life, saith the Lord. Whoso believeth in me, though
he were dead, yet shall he live, and he that liveth

<!-- vol 1 page 249 -->

and believeth in me shall never die!'&mdash;The thrill
which this shot through my frame I never can
forget. As he walked onwards before the coffin,
reciting other portions of Scripture to the like effect,
there was a manifest emotion excited in all the
spectators of so mournful a solemnity. When the
reading of the Scriptures selected for the occasion
was suspended, the coffin was placed over the grave,
near the remains of Emilie's paternal grandmother,
an Englishwoman. A pause now succeeded in the
service, when unexpectedly to me at least, the organ
struck up a sweet and melodious anthem of the
most solemn kind; its notes sometimes rolled
over our heads like distant thunder, sometimes
warbled plaintive and tender; it seemed a dirge,
such as a heavenly choir might be fancied to perform,
no person being seen to play it. During this solemn
harmony the body was slowly lowered down into
its last resting-place; and we were both shocked and
moved to see poor Emilie's little lap-dog, the companion
of her solitary walks, and which slept in her
room, make its way through the crowd and seek to
share her endless couch. It had not accompanied
her, but seemed to have followed the pastor with
the kind of inscrutable instinct which the more

<!-- vol 1 page 250 -->

sagacious of tame animals possess. It was of course
removed by the attendants; and as soon as dust had
been committed to dust and ashes to ashes, with
the usual solemnities, and the organ ceased to
sound, the clergyman resumed the service with&mdash;'Man
that is born of a woman hath but a little
time to live and is full of sorrow.'&mdash;Not a dry eye
could now be discerned in the chapel, and after
casting a last look on the name 'Emilie Fonrose,
aged 19 years,' upon the coffin, the pastor slowly
left the place, followed by us; we entered a small
carriage procured by his friends, and arrived sad
and silent at his now desert dwelling. Nor spoke he
a word that day, unable even to perform the usual
family worship in the evening. His race was run;
his earthly career finished: and when next morning
he assembled us to prayers, he began the Song of
Simeon, 'Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart
in peace,'&mdash;and there he was obliged to stop, his
tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth when he
would have continued.</p>

<p>"The unhappy old man by degrees regained his
tranquillity, and frequently blessed God for having
reserved this heavy blow till he was so near following
his beloved child, that it made only the difference

<!-- vol 1 page 251 -->

of closing his long life with a few months,
perhaps weeks, of wretchedness. I remarked that
he was more diligent than ever in the performance
of all his duties, and would take no help which his
neighbouring brethren tendered him in his ministrations.
He seemed, if not to derive comfort from
employment, at least to have his mind seduced from
the subject of his loss; and his piety assumed a
more fervent appearance than before. He complained,
however, that when not employed in his
pastoral duties, he suffered exceedingly; and one
feeling he could not get out of his mind. As the
door of his room opened, he would think Emilie
was coming in; he could not bring his mind to the
belief she had gone for ever. In his dreams, too,
she appeared to be restored to him; he never once
dreamt of her death; yet, he said, there was always
a something, as it were, hanging over her; she
could not speak; or she turned from him; she
went away; he could not follow or find her; there
was always something changed from what it once
had been; yet there she was, and alive again, and,
as if half conscious it was a dream only, he would
fear to awake. But when he did, sorrow returned
the more grievous when he found it had all been a

<!-- vol 1 page 252 -->

dream; and then the poor old man would wander
about as if to get rid of himself.</p>

<p>"But to one part of his small mansion he never
repaired; I did not once see him enter Emilie's
room; and indeed I, for a few days, was fain myself
to avoid this suffering. At last, alone, and when all
were out in the fields, I went into it. Nor shall I
soon forget the pang which the sight gave me. There
were her books, her drawing-paper, her half-finished
letter about some charity at St. Meurice, her pen
and inkstand, the chair she sat on. A simple straw
bonnet she had thrown off when setting out on her
last fatal journey, lay on the little sofa; her guitar,
now mute, was beside it; the musical box was
on the chimney-piece; and, most touching sight of
all, the poor little bird, hopped about in the cage,
flapping its wings as I entered the room, and pecking
at the bars, expecting to be taken out, and perch, as
heretofore, on its mistress's finger. The sight of
this goldfinch was a severe trial to me; its silence
seemed mournful; but when it began its warbling,
as formerly, I really felt quite unmanned. At that
moment Louise, who now too, for the first time,
ventured into the room on hearing my footsteps,
never having dared to enter it alone, came in and

<!-- vol 1 page 253 -->

found me. She saw I was moved. She heard the
poor little forsaken bird; she had been deeply
touched before by the sparrows flocking round her,
to receive their pension from their kind protectress's
hand, now stiff in the tomb. Altogether, and when
she cast her eyes on the bonnet which recalled her
friend, as if she had only gone out of the room, she
was entirely overcome: all her resolution fled; her
estrangement was suddenly put an end to; and
when she saw how much my feelings were now overpowered,
how entirely they were her own, she flew
into my outstretched arms, fell on my neck, sobbed
aloud, and could only articulate 'My dearest,
dearest friend!' "</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="small">THE HOUSE OF MIRTH.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">There</span> is an intimate connection between all the
tender emotions, as I have already said; between
pity and love a close connection; between sorrow
and love a closer still. The bodily frame which
influences the passion of love entirely, the sentiment
of love considerably, is powerfully affected by emotions
of grief. That which cannot be well named,
in its grossness, but</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 2 -->

<p>&mdash;that stands in the closest relation to emotions of a
sorrowful cast. All this I thought not of at the moment;
I have often since reflected on it. But now
the sun is sinking in the west, and we must reserve our
recollections of the past for another day."</p>

<p>The Solitary paused;&mdash;and Chatillon, full of the
mournful feelings which his narrative had inspired,
returned towards the Ch&acirc;teau, his mind entirely occupied
with the image of Emilie Fonrose. He felt
deeply the beauties of her simple and touching character;
and though anything rather than a sentimental
person, for he was indeed as much a man of
the world as his wife was a worldly woman, yet,
having a heart naturally tender, and the sweetest
disposition when not perverted by the follies and
vices of society, he nearly wept as he dwelt upon the
sad recital of the fate which closed her quiet, innocent
life; nor could he get out of his mind Albert and
Louise's mournful visit to her homely apartment
after her peaceful spirit had fled to the far distant
mansions of spirits more peaceful still.</p>

<p>In this frame of mind he arrived at the Ch&acirc;teau
just as the Countess returned from a long walk with
the Baron, and finished a discussion on the present
state of public affairs, which had lasted during

<!-- vol 2 page 3 -->

the long walk. His melancholy and political forebodings
were for the moment dispelled by an important
addition just made to the party in the person of
the Marchioness's brother, the Chevalier Deverell
and his son. The original and joyous character of
the Chevalier, nay, his very look and gait, seemed to
shut out care and almost thought from whatever
apartment he was in; he was the picture of English
good cheer and good fellowship; and his son,
gay, but in another line, was one of the most finished
gentlemen of the Parisian circles, the admiration or
the envy of all the men, the slave of all the fair
ones that adorned these haunts of gaiety and refinement.
But between father and son there was so
little resemblance, that rumour and her twin sister,
slander, were busy on the subject of their relationship,
whispering it was rather nominal than real;
for the one was slender as the other was gross; the
one all airs and affectations, the other plain and
simple; the one bent upon making himself talked
of and run after; the other resolute in his determination
to let nothing ruffle him, or keep him from
enjoying the good things of this life. One thing
they seemed to have in common, and only one.
Neither was deficient in abilities, and wit and

<!-- vol 2 page 4 -->

humour they had alike; but both were somewhat
disposed towards lending themselves to the mirth
their peculiarities occasioned. In this amiable and
not unwise humour they indulged, partly from natural
joyousness of temper, partly from the fearless
and careless tone acquired in good society;
both fearless that they should lower their dignity
(and both careless if they did so), by contributing
to the pleasantry of the society they moved in so conspicuously,
and enjoyed with so keen a relish. They
were much esteemed by the Marchioness, in spite
of the wide difference of their lives and the extreme
contrast of their views and observances on religious
matters, they being barely tolerant of her puritanical
habits, while she daily lamented over their ungracious
and alarming state.</p>

<p>The society, to them strange, in which they had
fallen, did in nowise embarrass or restrain them;
for they proceeded forthwith to take their place and
bear their share in the conversation, as if they had
been all their lives among the persons present.
"Well, sister of mine," exclaimed the Chevalier,
"well, I protest the roads of Languedoc be made
for the punishment of sin here below."&mdash;"Why,
brother, what can you mean by your irreverent allusion

<!-- vol 2 page 5 -->

to so serious a matter?"&mdash;"Serious, I grant
you:" said the man of many stone, "never was I
less moved to mirth in my days than while suffering
the penance between Orange and Avignon. I
verily thought his Holiness had from charity put
forth a bull, expressly to make a heretic like me pay
here in my person, to the end that I might suffer the
less hereafter."&mdash;"I beseech you, dear brother,"
said the good Marchioness, "do not speak lightly
on such sacred subjects."&mdash;"On the contrary, fair
dame, I feel disposed to comfort my inward man
by dining for a certain space, having no whit eaten
since I solaced me with a brace or two of Rhone
tench, which I much commend, and a flagon of Hermitage,
which I more entirely approve: imbibing
the same, as I did, in full view of the vineyard itself
as I journeyed through Tain in the morn of yesterday.
Your delicate nephew there marvelled at my
thus breaking my fast, and would needs sip his
coffee."&mdash;"Truly, sir," answered the slender party,
"and my finery, which you were graciously pleased
to make merry with, received its due reward. Anything
less like coffee I never did taste than the villainous
compound of burnt crust, brown sugar, and
lean whey which they inflicted on me under the

<!-- vol 2 page 6 -->

name of caf&eacute;-au-lait, while you seemed to enjoy
yourself absolutely, with your meal and your morning
pipe, looking the very picture of contentment."&mdash;"I
own me," said the larger man, "to have felt
comforted inwardly, during that pause in our jolting;
but my bones have kept as accurate a register of
jolts as ever Napier's did of sums and differences.<sup id="r013"><a href="#n013">13</a></sup>
But Ernest of mine, hast thou made thy obeisance
to the Countess? She has clean forgotten me, who
knew her grandfather; thee she may perchance be
pleased to recognise, for I made thee known to her
one day at Court, more years ago than she may be
graciously pleased to recollect." The young gentleman,
who, however, was nearer thirty than twenty,
went gracefully to the Countess, who had retired into
a recess for a few moments, to ask the Count how
his second visit to the cave had ended. "Permit,"
said Ernest, "one of your numerous troop of
slaves to bend before you, should you not suffer
him to be laid prostrate at your feet."&mdash;"M. Deverell,"
said she, "you possibly may remember

<!-- vol 2 page 7 -->

enough of me to be aware that I belong not to
the herd who take delight in such effusions, any
more than you do to either my or any other person's
troop of slaves."&mdash;"Thus spoke the great-minded
personage, the Maitresse-femme, so superior
to her sex's frivolous follies, so formed to play
a first part in the affairs now beginning to occupy
our common country."&mdash;"At all events," said she,
"whether I be so or not, I am happy to meet
you again, and especially under the roof of your
worthy aunt."&mdash;"Be assured, Countess, the happiness
is more than mutual."&mdash;"Well, possibly it
may be; but you think then we are to see stirring
times? What news do you bring from Court?"&mdash;"Madame,
I meddle not in politics; they belong
to your caste; they are above my head."&mdash;"And
why? No one has better abilities than you throw
away on frivolous occupations, no one could more
easily excel in things of moment."&mdash;"Alas, and if
I should sacrifice pleasure, and ease, and comfort,
for distinctions of the kind you dream of, should I
be the happier, or the state the better, for the exchange
I had made?"</p>

<p>Some more good advice of the fair stateswoman
was then thrown after bad, as happens with counsel

<!-- vol 2 page 8 -->

as well as coin; and she retired to her toilette, the
only female occupation to which she devoted any
of her time and attention. Ernest too retired to the
like pursuit; while the Chevalier, ascertaining that
one or two Nismes beauties were expected to arrive
in the evening, and pass a day or two at the Ch&acirc;teau,
made arrangements for enjoying his pipe in his own
room, with his worthy old companion, the land-steward
of the Marquess, who had grown grey in
the service, and could both amuse the Chevalier and
be entertained by him while they quaffed their punch
and smoked their tobacco, and occasionally interrupted
their talk with a game at picquet.</p>

<p>The Countess was not, this time, so impatient
with her husband's unwillingness to repeat the substance
of the Solitary's communications. She had
become more immersed in public topics, as the
Parliament of Grenoble, now assembled, had begun
to act upon the contagion caught from the meeting
at Vizille; and the ease with which the Baron now
lent himself to her political discussions, and even, in
some sort, to the schemes of ambition she was framing,
had, joined to his unceasing and daily increasing
devotion, begun to make an impression upon her
wholly new, and excite emotions never before felt

<!-- vol 2 page 9 -->

by her. The first effect of this change, unperceived
by herself, was to improve her extremely; she
became softer and more feminine; she could more
easily bear female society, and could, for an hour
or so, permit trivial topics to be broached in her
presence without showing that she was weary or disgusted.
The absolute confidence she reposed in her
own coldness, her utter disbelief in the possibility of
any one making the slightest impression on her
heart, kept her blind to her danger, until she had
drunk too deep of the cup of admiration; admiration
of the Baron's brilliant talents, seasoned with his
far greater admiration of her varied charms, to be
capable of stopping, or of rousing herself from the
trance it threw her into, or of even wishing she had
the power to awake. For awhile, the love of
politics, which had paved the way for this revolution
in her system, continued to move and to
guide her intercourse with the Baron. She felt a
daily increased pleasure in his society; she began to
count the hours when he was absent, fancying she
had lost some opportunity of reaping information
from his richly-stored mind, or hints from his long
and various experience; she no longer formed plans
of leaving Languedoc for Dauphin&eacute;, persuading

<!-- vol 2 page 10 -->

herself that Nismes was likely to become a centre of
political action. She soon prolonged her walks with
him; she took an interest in his niece, whose tender
simplicity and shining talents alike were formed to
interest her now that her own mind had become
somewhat softened; she filled her letters with circumstances
relating to him, or things which he had
told her; she loved to see him mentioned in the
letters she received from her many correspondents;
she took a pleasure in being associated with him,
whether by those correspondents or by the guests of
the Ch&acirc;teau. Secure, as she believed, in her impregnable
virtue, she was for ever desiring to be with
him, and preferred being alone with him, only, as
she flattered herself, that she might have a more
undivided share of his conversation. As she was
of an unassailable reputation, she was far from
disliking the pleasantries of the Count and the
Marquess on her intimacy with her new and distinguished
friend; and she at length found, and confessed
to herself, that she had an indescribable pleasure
even in being in the same room with him, and near
him, though they conversed not together. This was
no sooner confessed to herself, than it was studiously
forgotten; but when she saw him pay some little

<!-- vol 2 page 11 -->

attention to another, a younger person of some
beauty, and considerable talents, one of those who,
as we have said, had come from Nismes for a few
days, and when he approached not to her part of
the saloon as usual in the evening, she felt her
colour change, her impatience increase, her bosom
heave, her indignation rise. For the first time in
her life, she knew what jealousy was; because she,
for the first time, had felt love: and hurrying to her
room she flung herself on a sofa, and burst into tears,
partly of vexation, but partly too of self-abasement,
for she could no longer disguise from herself that she
shared, and shared to distraction, the passion she
had long perceived was raging in the Baron. These
tears, however, were not so bitter as might have been
expected; they had no avail in quenching the fire
they were poured upon; her whole soul was occupied;
she could dream of nothing but her love; and
she waited with impatience till she could hear from
the Baron's own lips that which she never doubted
was consuming his heart.</p>

<p>That moment soon arrived. He was obliged to
go for some days upon business to Lyons; and he
might be absent even longer, though he took not
Emmeline with him, that his movements might be

<!-- vol 2 page 12 -->

more rapid. He seemed to avoid a walk with her
the evening before his departure; he spoke to no
one else in the company, when in the drawing-room,
but seemed wrapped in thought; he seldom came
near her, but she asked him if his going was fixed;
he said it was, and made no mention of his sorrow
at parting. Could it be that she had been so far
mistaken? Was it possible that she had put a
wrong construction on phrases of admiration, and
falsely supposed compliments lavished upon all
bore a peculiar reference to herself? Her pride now
came to her aid; she was for the moment aroused
to a sense of her danger, and within a hair's breadth
of being saved from the precipice that yawned so
near her; the fever of indignation succeeded to the
wound of pride; she never could forgive either him
or herself for this humiliating mortification. Yet,
just herself, she could not condemn another unheard;
true herself, she liked not to charge another with
falsehood; she must ascertain the fact before he
went; and it was her fate to be plunged headlong
into the abyss, by the very love of truth and of
justice which formed the great staple, as it was the
bright ornament, of her character.</p>

<p>As he passed her, going towards the Orangery,

<!-- vol 2 page 13 -->

she asked if he had any directions to give about
Emmeline before he went, and that if he had she
could receive them now, as she might not see him
in the morning, his plan being to go early. He
thanked her courteously, not warmly, and they
were soon alone in the Orangery. "Then you
must go," she said.&mdash;"Yes, Countess," he replied,
"I must go."&mdash;"And for how long?"&mdash;"I know
not, perhaps I hardly care."&mdash;" What! Is this your
interest in us all, and in your niece?"&mdash;"I shall
send a confidential servant for her and her governess,
should I not return."&mdash;"Gracious heaven! Not
return? Then where are you going? What are
you meditating?"&mdash;"The truth is, Countess, I find
by too many indications that I have remained here
too long."&mdash;"Why so? How can that be? You
see all here delighted to have you among them.
You are the very pride of the society. The Marquess
and Marchioness are vain of having you here, their
guest. The chief persons of the neighbourhood
flock hither to enjoy your society. The company
hang upon your lips. The Count himself, all careless
as his nature is, and alien from deep reflection,
has taken more delight in your company than I
ever saw him do in any other man's. Even I, little

<!-- vol 2 page 14 -->

used to form intimate acquaintances, even I,"&mdash;here
something stopped her voice; she could go no further;
he looked anxiously at her; he seized her hand;
he saw some moisture for the first time in her eye;
her hand returned the pressure of his; he softly
whispered, "Oh, could I but think you would
regret my absence!"&mdash;when she, with ardour half
suppressed, said, "Only promise me you won't go!
or promise me you will return. I should take your
remaining away very, very unkind. Say you'll come
back to me;"&mdash;and as he said in a rapture, "Oh,
my heavenly love!"&mdash;she at once sunk into his
arms. He could only fix a burning kiss upon her
unresisting lips, when the door of the Orangery
opening, the Marchioness entered, and summoned
them to supper.</p>

<p>The Countess, however, had received so violent
a shock from this scene, that she really felt unwell,
and retired to her apartment. The Baron was
during the remainder of the evening in a state of
gaiety, and even overflowing spirits, which seemed
somewhat uncourteous to the society he was on the
eve of leaving; and Emmeline could only account
for so great a contrast to his wonted depression
when about to leave her, for how short a time

<!-- vol 2 page 15 -->

soever, by supposing that the effort had thrown him
into a morbid state of false spirits, as she had sometimes
been thrown herself in similar circumstances.
Next morning he set out; but not without leaving a
short letter, in which he breathed, with his habitual
eloquence and power of imagery as well as of
diction, the tender feelings towards the Countess
which filled his heart, but carefully avoiding the
least indication of the joy he felt at having made the
precious and to him most unexpected discovery,
that he had won that haughty, obdurate, and cold
heart, and made it glow with something of the
ardour which warmed his own.</p>

<p>The feelings of the Countess were of a mixed description.
She was relieved from all doubt as to the
Baron, and had escaped the last humiliation which
for a moment she had dreaded as her most unbearable
punishment, that of her passion not being returned.
She was also occupied with that passion in
a mood not unpleasing. Yet she did feel humbled,
and she did feel uneasy, at the change which a few
weeks had wrought in her position. She no longer
could hold her head erect as one of the few women
in her rank and of her figure against whom no
imputation could be cast. From all guilt, even in

<!-- vol 2 page 16 -->

thought, she was free, and she well knew should for
ever so remain. But she had listened to a declaration
of ardent love; she had confessed that she
returned it all but as warmly; she had received a
written avowal of the passion, respectful, indeed,
even humble, far more so than her conduct the
night before warranted her to expect. Yet still
she had received a love-letter, and she had a lover.
She had a lover, too, whose views of their future
intercourse were in all probability far less pure than
her own; and she knew that into the plans of men
so circumstanced, men who have ascertained that
they are beloved, ideas enter of a kind very different
from any she would ever tolerate. All this both
wounded her pride, and gave her the painful prospect
of differences with the object of her attachment
in their future intercourse. These feelings alone
disturbed the joy she could not, help experiencing at
the certainty of the Baron's devotion to her. From
the Count she had nothing to apprehend. Their
union had been one of convenience, merely; and
neither was likely to be jealous of the other as long
as the due regard was paid to the observances of
society. She had long known of his forming attachments
elsewhere; but they were so conducted as

<!-- vol 2 page 17 -->

not to annoy her by any unpleasant exhibition of a
rival's influence; and he never had thought of interfering
with her intimacies, hitherto political, and
which he knew would always remain such. This
source of annoyance, therefore, did not exist, yet still
she suffered; her pride was wounded by a consciousness
quite strange to her, and her future prospects
were clouded with troubles equally new. During
the Baron's absence, she said to herself, "I may
recover the self-respect I forfeited in an evil hour.
I may write to implore he would release me, and
help me, if he truly loves me, to regain the peace
of mind I have lost. I may before he returns
make Chatillon leave the Ch&acirc;teau and hasten to"&mdash;
But this idea was too hateful to be entertained;
and she at once dismissed it from her mind with the
thought, a self-deception certainly, but, an easy and
a natural one, "How could she quit the charge of
Emmeline, committed by the Baron to her care at
her own desire, and leave her among strangers?"
She wholly forgot that the Marchioness was quite
as little a stranger as herself. But she was calmed
and reconciled to remain by this suggestion of love,
the father of self-deception&mdash;and who also has a

<!-- vol 2 page 18 -->

pretty numerous progeny of more vulgar and worse
dressed lies.</p>

<p>She had, some days before, begged him to write, if
any important event came within his knowledge; and
she now counted the days till a letter should arrive
from him. It was such as she most rejoiced to
receive; for with his perfect knowledge of the female
heart, and his mastery of those he sought to captivate
or to keep enchained, he said not a word of his
feelings, at least not a word that any one but herself
could have understood; for his vehement expressions
of sorrow at his separation from the Ch&acirc;teau were
all referred by him to having left his dear niece;
and towards the Countess herself, his language was
that of the most studied, distant, and even cold
respect. The subject of the letter was, in the main,
the state of public feeling in Orange, a place, he
said, whose inhabitants struck him as of a peculiarly
fierce aspect; and other places, through which he
had passed, he made mention of in the same indifferent
way: only that he slightly threw in some
mention of his own welfare and escape from the
fatigues and risks of the long journey. He wrote
from Vienne, and was to reach Lyons next day.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 19 -->

<p>The morning that this letter arrived was Sunday;
and kept, as usual in the Huguenot Ch&acirc;teau, with
the utmost strictness. The dinner had, on the day
before, been graced with the presence of Counsellor
Courdemont. Madame de Chatillon, having a
head-ache, kept her room to shun the infliction.
The rest of the party, however, were all agreed
that the former accounts of this evil were much
exaggerated, and all had been agreeably surprised
with his various information, and his power of
language, though they all felt the excess in which
the one was administered and the other used. The
day was a successful one to the Counsellor, fortunate
in the absence of the caustic, intolerant
Baron, and only the Chevalier complained. He
next morning began the conversation at breakfast
with a groan, which startled the company; but it
was explained when he excused himself for having
left the room in the evening before coffee. "I positively
will not be preached at of a Saturday, that's
flat. Sunday you have, if you will, sister of me;
Saturday is mine own day, and none of your parsons,
be they priests or pastors, shall pin me down on
that day."&mdash;" Why, brother, it was a counsellor, not
a clergyman."&mdash;"I cry your mercy, Madam, I

<!-- vol 2 page 20 -->

thought otherwise; but your lawyer can preach you
to the full as long as any priest, and may be not so
well. So I went off to my pipe, which is a safe and a
silent companion." Ernest did not so much complain;
for he had repeatedly broken a lance with
the conversationalist, and as often had discomfited
him; the play of the professed talker, the bookmonger,
being nothing to the practised dexterity of
the man of the world. It had seemed as if the
laugh was ever ready at Ernest's bidding, and the
lawyer's expense.</p>

<p>The Chevalier, as soon as breakfast was over,
asked the Marchioness to let him have the carriage,
that he might visit a neighbouring Baron. "Not
for the world, brother, on Sunday," was the answer.
But when she soon after wished him to accompany
her to church, his reply was, "Not for the world,
on a Sunday, sister;"&mdash;so she was fain to leave him
lounging about the grounds, and to take Emmeline,
who wanted to hear M. Gardein preach. "Is that
an elderly gentleman?" asked the Count eagerly.
"Alas, no," said the Marchioness, "it is his grandson
and successor. The dear old pastor has been
dead some little time: nor has he left a better man
behind him."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 21 -->

<p>The ladies of the party, except the Marchioness,
stayed at home; meaning to attend mass the following
day, which was the great feast of All Souls;
so that Ernest had abundant scope for his gay and
philandering propensities. He had very soon become
familiar with these fair strangers; having that easy
confidence which, without being obtrusive, or even
appearing forward, soon leaps over the bounds that
separate more formal natures; an inoffensive and
polite confidence, which only an habitual usage of
the great world, perhaps the possession of a certain
station in it, can fully bestow. It looked as if, when
he entered the room for the first or second time, all
the party were his near cousins. He also seemed
ever to be so much at his ease, that he did just as
he chose; neither speaking to avoid the awkwardness
of not knowing how to hold his head and body,
or to dispose of his limbs, nor being silent to escape
observation; standing up when he was tired of sitting,
walking to and fro when he had rested long
enough in one place, throwing himself down on a
chair, or a sofa, or an ottoman, when he wanted to
lounge, taking up a book when he chose, joining the
talk when he liked it; in short, doing and saying,
and being, exactly what and how he pleased, and as

<!-- vol 2 page 22 -->

if he were alone in the room; never as if he thought
all eyes were turned upon him, because he had long
been aware of the last thing learnt by persons little
accustomed to good company, that nobody was
thinking of, or looking at, or caring about him,
unless when it suited him to address them, or otherwise
call their attention. Emmeline, who was
extremely shy, remarked these things afterwards
to her uncle, adding that she observed Ernest
never entered with real zeal or anxiety into any
discussion, but seemed somewhat indifferent on all
subjects, even those he best knew and must be
supposed to care most about; whereas the Counsellor
was fiery and vehement on every topic, and
never knew when to have done, nor seemed aware
how little interest all that heard him took in the different
subjects of his discussion. Nevertheless, her
acute and true-judging mind, ever guided by right
feelings, and unshaken purity of purpose, preferred
this tiresome Counsellor, with all his faults, to the
amusing man of fashion, in whose conversation she
could take no pleasure. With her, sincerity and truth
were the first of virtues, and the lawyer was at least
sincere; nay, he was considered by the frivolous as
tiresome, because of his pedantry&mdash;that is to say,

<!-- vol 2 page 23 -->

his always being honestly and heartily occupied with
his subject; while Ernest never seemed to be serious
about anything, and, though possibly incapable of
wilful falsehood, to be always in chase of amusement
and effect rather than of truth. Whoever attended
to Emmeline's own conversation perceived that she
carefully avoided all colouring, all exaggeration,
and, by a skilful selection of particulars strictly true,
or of topics rigorously correct, would produce as
great an effect, whether to strike or to entertain, as
Ernest and his caste could, with all their romance
and rhodomontade.</p>

<p>After the Chevalier and his son had been a day or
two at the Ch&acirc;teau, and she was giving the Baron her
opinion of the latter, she took occasion to express her
wonder that he should not only be amused with such
light material, but should prefer his society to M.
Courdemont's. "Really, dearest Zio," said she,
"it is so unlike your usual way of estimating men;
for who so much as you are in search of valuable
qualities? You always strike into the kernel, casting
off the husk to get at it. You dig for pure gold,
and care little how deep the one lies, so you be sure
it is there."&mdash;"Love, you are right;" he replied,
"and I am perhaps somewhat spoiled by refined

<!-- vol 2 page 24 -->

society, which may have infected me with its fastidiousness.
But I own that Counsellor does wear me
out. Besides, I see no small self-complacency and
love of display in him, as well as much prolixity and
many corners."&mdash;"But always reflect, Zio, that the
pedantry in which his hardness and his tiresomeness
consists, is the attendant of good. It is the fruit of
honest zeal, and the pledge of hard toil."&mdash;"Well,
positively, my Emmeline, you are taking to the
epigrammatic; a style I always thought your severe
taste and honest nature rejected. What more could
Montesquieu have said, whom I can never get
you to endure?"&mdash;"Aye! but, dear Zio, his is
not only the epigrammatic, it is the enigmatic, the
riddle-my-riddle way of writing; and what I can't
bear in him is, that he sacrifices truth to style;
he seems to be guided in his theories by the sparkling
things, the antitheses and the points they
lead to."&mdash;"As rhymes are said to steer the course
of a poet."&mdash;"And as, indeed," she replied, "they
most certainly very often do." The delight which
the Baron never failed to find in the extraordinary
sense and nice discernment, as well as perfect
purity of his niece, was the exquisite enjoyment
of his life, and he consulted her as he would an

<!-- vol 2 page 25 -->

older person. "But what think you," he now
added, "of Ernest's father, the gay, and jolly, and
good humoured Chevalier? He, I am sure, is honest
and natural enough."&mdash;"Yes," answered Emmeline,
"but he is too much of a mere voluptuary for me.
And his discourse on sacred subjects borders on the
profane. However, I fairly own that he has so little
of affectation in his amusing buffoonery, that I much
prefer him to his refined son, who suits not my fancy
at all, at all."</p>

<p>The rest of the female society had a far less severe
taste than Mdlle. de Moulin, and it was accordingly
with the female part of the company at the Ch&acirc;teau
that Ernest seemed to make most play; though,
even with them, he would not leave his habitual
indifference; a peculiarity that seemed to Emmeline
plainly affected, in order to make them more anxious
about him, and she perceived it had the effect it was
desired to produce in this way. Before this young
person, indeed, he set bounds to his extravagances,
and even locked himself up in her presence; but
when she went to her apartment, he sallied forth
from his temporary confinement. The subject rolled
upon his flirtation with a celebrated beauty, on whom
the Countess rallied him gaily. "Madam," said

<!-- vol 2 page 26 -->

he, "I vow to you, as I have repeatedly to her,
that till I saw her I never knew what love was."&mdash;"Why,
did she believe you?" asked Madame Leblanc,
who had just arrived.&mdash;"And why not,
Madam?" inquired he.&mdash;"Why? because you had,
to my knowledge, said the same thing to at least
three women with whom you were successively
supposed to be very well. Two admitted it to
me."&mdash;"Utterly untrue, my good friend!" he rejoined.
"Those lovely persons are all three more
cold than any icicle; and if I ever used such expressions
to them in the course of my devotions, it
must have been in some peculiar sense."&mdash;"But how
goes on your suit with the Viscountess?" asked
Madame Leblanc.&mdash;"I protest," said he, "I had, for
the moment, forgotten that matter, for truly it is ten
weeks old, at the least. Yes; she first taught me
to love. I have been at her feet these three moons,
or so."&mdash;"How do you get on?"&mdash;"Indifferent
well; I am barely breaking ground; not advanced
to my second parallel."&mdash;"Any flag of truce yet?"
asked the Countess.&mdash;"Why, hardly, hardly; but
a weak point found upon a late reconnoitring
expedition."&mdash;"Then how far advanced are you
with the Baroness I first spoke of, one of the many

<!-- vol 2 page 27 -->

before seeing whom you never knew what love
was?"&mdash;"Why, I have threatened twice to fly
from Europe, and bury myself in Cayenne, where
the morasses are fatal; and finding this had little
effect, I made an attempt upon my life the morning
I quitted Paris. The result was, on the whole, favourable,
and I am supposed at present to be confined
in a private madhouse. She received a raving,
incoherent letter from me a few days back, scrawled
with charcoal, on a sheet of brown paper; and my
confidant who took it to her observed her to be
visibly softened."&mdash;"How could she believe in your
having attempted suicide?"&mdash;"That I know not;
but this I know, that when I, by this means, stormed
the heart of the Chevalier Mazel's wife, she had the
surgeon's certificate. He is an old schoolfellow
of mine; he sewed up my throat, and helped to
save my life, and to win my love."&mdash;"Pray," asked
Madame Leblanc, "what came of your affair with
the fair widow you met at Ch&acirc;teau Meuron?"&mdash;"Oh!
as for your widows, they are as bad as damsels,
or thereabouts. Their point is holy matrimony.
After a fortnight's siege, and making considerable
progress, insomuch that the time seemed come for
an assault, I candidly demanded a parley with the

<!-- vol 2 page 28 -->

governor; an audience in her room, that we might
discuss matters more at our ease when the family
should have retired to rest:&mdash;she as candidly intimated
that the key of her door lay in the porch of
the parish church; so I desisted, and raised the
siege."</p>

<p>The Countess, though for the moment amused
with this young muscadin's eccentricities and coxcombries,
became soon sufficiently tired of them,
and had rather hear him speak on important subjects
in a rational way, as he was well able to do
when he chose to be serious. She was therefore not
sorry next morning to find the conversation was
taking a more grave turn at the breakfast-table. It
began with the Marchioness asking the Chevalier,
"Did you attend family worship this morning,
brother?"&mdash;"Nay," answered he.&mdash;"Have you had
your pipe before breakfast?" asked the Marquess.&mdash;"Yea,"
was the reply.&mdash;"I wonder much," said
the Countess, "at this practice of smoking, which
appears to be gaining ground everywhere."&mdash;"Madam,"
said the Chevalier with a complacent smile,
"whoever hath not known the comforts of a pipe, I
may say the genuine, inward comforts, may well so
marvel as does your excellency. For me, I hold it a

<!-- vol 2 page 29 -->

most special accommodation."&mdash;"But, how so?" said
his fair questioner; "What internal comfort can you
derive from drawing the smoke of a weed through
a tube and diffusing it in the air?"&mdash;"Madam,
as thus&mdash;when I am occupied in this wise, I forget
the world, and retiring within mine own individual
self, I feel a spiritual abstraction from all outward
concerns, framing wisest plans, building choicest
castles, indulging fondest hopes, peradventure smiting,
with scorn and with power, bitterest foes. As
the clouds of smoke veil my head, they exclude
the outward world, and elevate me to a higher existence,
the rather if I should have nigh my elbow
some foaming tankard of a choice liquor, like that
wherewithal the worthy steward Gaspar did regale
me while we sat at our studies two nights ago."&mdash;"For
my part," said Mdme. Leblanc, "I abominate
the practice, deeming the vile weed which you inhale
a poisonous defilement, and having always remarked
that while men smoke, their imaginations wander in
uncharitable directions."&mdash;"Wherefore, lady, I do
remember me of your divers and sundry times taking
large pinches of that same weed, how defiling soever,
and placing the same by way of a charge in the two
barrels of your gracious nose." It was in vain that

<!-- vol 2 page 30 -->

the fair lady sought to prove the difference between
tobacco burnt and tobacco ground; so she sheltered
her behind ecclesiastical authority, and maintained
that the Bishop and all the clergy of the
diocese took snuff, whereas not one of them ever
smoked. She was going on to cite instances of
noted smokers, having to her certain knowledge,
"because a lady told her," been guilty of scandalous
behaviour, and even of breaking the most important
of all the commandments, as she was pleased to
term the seventh. "But sister Marchioness," said the
Chevalier, turning to Mdme. de Bagnolles, "might
I dare to hope the Counsellor, the man of much
word, shall this day quit the Ch&acirc;teau?"&mdash;"Why, has
he talked you to death, brother?" cried the Marchioness.&mdash;"Aye,
truly, hath he, and death beyond
the law, now that torture is abolished excepting for
the necessary purpose of extracting the truth. Seldom
suffered I so much. Wherefore did I suddenly
vanish and quit the room, leaving him to torment
the residue of the society. Excuse me, Madame Leblanc,
for interrupting your abuse of tobacco smoke."&mdash;"But,"
said that fair lady (reverting to a more favourite
topic), "I had forgot to mention the shocking
fate of poor Madame Vidal, the Commissary's

<!-- vol 2 page 31 -->

wife, who having been separated by his absence
in the army for above a year, was on his return
last week unhappily taken in labour, to his infinite
horror."&mdash;" And I'll dare swear," said the
Chevalier, "to Madames no small horror too."&mdash;"Why,
yes, Chevalier," said the lady of Nismes,
"I don't fancy you yourself would much have liked
it."&mdash;"Why, truth to say," answered he, "it is so
long since I was confined myself, that I have well
nigh forgotten the taste of caudle, or the look of a
monthly nurse."&mdash;"Now really, Chevalier, will
nothing make you serious for a moment on the most
grave, and indeed distressing, subjects?" While she
thus moralized, Ernest, who had rode over to Nismes
before breakfast, returned, bringing with him a rumour
from Dauphin&eacute; that the flame kindled in that
province was now spread to Grenoble, where the
parliament of Dauphin&eacute; had pronounced Lettres de
Cachet illegal, and sentenced to death whosoever
should presume to execute them within the province.</p>

<p>A thunderbolt falling on the breakfast-table and
suddenly fusing the butter, or an angel alighting upon
it and dipping his wing in the cream-pot, would
have created less consternation than this sudden
and unexpected intelligence, which forthwith became

<!-- vol 2 page 32 -->

the subject of the whole discourse. "Heard man
ever the like of this?" exclaimed Madame Leblanc.
"To what shall we next come, when a worthy man
can no longer shut up his perfidious and cruel adversary
during pleasure?"&mdash;"Ah, me!" sighed the
good Abb&eacute;, "when I turned me to this hospitable
mansion, to the end that I might refresh nature and
be more able to prosecute my journey toward home,
little dreamt I of having to hear such disastrous
tidings! The noblesse are now undone, and so the
throne is shaken, and not only the throne, but the
state, and not only the state, but the whole lay community,
and not only the lay community, but the
Church herself, yea, the Church is no longer safe!
Preserve us! What are we fated to see, in these
awful times?"</p>

<p>"Why, look ye, Father," said the good Chevalier,
"I do protest against placing the Church as above
the whole community, crown and nobles included.
Yet I heartily grieve over this invaluable privilege
of the upper classes and of the sovereign. Nor see
I very well how society can go on without it. Had
I but exerted, my right to have a lettre de cachet,
and shut up that wild youth from the age of eighteen
to his present time of life, what service should I

<!-- vol 2 page 33 -->

have rendered him, and how truly grateful would
he have proved, being wise for his own interest!"</p>

<p>"Aye, truly, sir," said Ernest, "but fully more
grateful for your kind and considerate proceeding
in abstaining from exercising that most invaluable
privilege, against which, now it is as good as dead
and gone, far be it from me to speak any evil
at all."</p>

<p>"But, truly," said the Count, "I begin to feel
no little alarm at the pace which change, or improvement
if you will, is taking. Had it gone on
gradually and moderately, I should have felt little
uneasiness. But if the Dauphin&eacute; spirit should
become generally diffused, who can see the end
of it?"</p>

<p>"I am exactly of your opinion," the Marquess
added. "To excite, all at once, a great people
calling into action millions with their ignorance,
their rash resolves, their contempt of danger, their
utter want of individual responsibility, by preaching to
them their rights, and representing all the established
institutions of the country as so many wrongs, is an
experiment so fraught with peril, so directly leading
to an universal explosion, that I dread to contemplate
the consequences. I should not wonder if we

<!-- vol 2 page 34 -->

had a cry for assembling the States General, which
have not met since 1614, and would be as unwieldy
as an old obsolete engine."</p>

<p>"No, no," said the Prince Caramelli, to whom
the French constitution had of late been explained,
"that will never happen. You might as well speak
of a limited monarchy in France, as they are said to
have in England."</p>

<p>"I hold it," said the Abb&eacute;, "well nigh as much
out of all question, as if you were to propose the
extinction of the sacred right to tithe, a right as old
as the Mosaic dispensation, God be praised, and as
unalterable."</p>

<p>"Stay a little there, Abb&eacute;," said Ernest, "you
pray for the conversion of the ancient people of
God. Then how unalterable?"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Verily, young man," answered the sacred individual,
"it little beseemeth any one of thy years to
handle the weightier matters of the law. Howbeit,
not answering a fool in his folly, it may suffice to
note that when we desire that people to be taken into
the fold of the New Covenant, we do assume that
they bring over with them the blessings of the Old
also."</p>

<p>The conversation continued to roll upon the unsettled

<!-- vol 2 page 35 -->

aspect of public affairs. The most rational and
best informed person in the company, the Marquess,
observed, that to imagine, as some crack-brained
enthusiasts did, the possibility of a limited government
being established in France, was only second
in wild extravagance to the notion of those fanatics,
who having served in the American war, dreamt of
France existing without a monarchy, because the
Republicans of Boston, and the Quakers of Philadelphia,
had set up a Commonwealth in their new
and thinly peopled country. However, the Count
de Chatillon viewed, and alone viewed, these things
in another light. His clear judgment, unembarrassed
by theory, and yet emancipated from the
trammels of authority, seemed to foresee a far wider
spread of the new opinions and a far more universal
change than others either hoped or dreaded to
arise out of them.</p>

<p>His mind was gloomy and clouded as often as
he reflected on the engrossing subject in all men's
thoughts: and to relieve him, for his wonted amusements
no longer had the power, he again sought
the solitary retreat of Albert, who at his request
thus continued his narrative.</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">THE LOVERS.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The</span> happiness which I tasted in having contrary
to all my fears regained Louise's affections, and, as
I fervently hoped, chased from her mind the project
of taking the veil, for the moment weaned my
thoughts both from their late melancholy occupation
since poor Emilie's unhappy fate, and also from
the alarms in which I still lived for my own safety.
The mind cannot easily become the lodging-place
of more than one strong feeling at once; nor of
more than a single violent passion. So far then my
love for Louise, which no longer seemed hopeless,
removed me from the state of perpetual apprehension
in which I had so long been tortured, and was a
change for the better, even under the severe sufferings
and successions of disappointments with which
it soon was fated to be attended.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 37 -->

<p>"The first few weeks after our recent loss were,
on the whole, the happiest, perhaps I should rather
say the least wretched, I had for many a long day
known. I wandered about with Louise in the beautiful
scenery that borders the lake; I made excursions
with her to the Alpine scenery at the base of
Mont Blanc; we visited together the Ch&acirc;teau de
Chillon, famous for its romantic story; we rowed
on the silver lake when tired with walking among
the cherry-tree groves, or the huge rocky fragments,
that seem to have been torn from the gigantic
Dent du Midi, and hurled down along the
plain which stretches out below. Now and then, for
variety to our rambles, we would set out early in the
morning to spend the day at some farm-house, retired
far from towns and roads, and embosomed in
trees with meadows around, watered by mountain
rills. There with the peasants we would partake
of their homely fare, and join in their simple conversation;
then help them to make their hay or
bring home their cows to milk. Some book, generally
of a theological cast, was the companion of
our walks, and we freely discussed its subject, as
well as its merits. Louise's mind was highly cultivated;
and as her confidence in me made her

<!-- vol 2 page 38 -->

give me credit for having owed my conversion from
Romanism to the influence of reason, and not to
the accidents of my situation, it was not unnatural
that, as our intimacy became closer and our intercourse
was prolonged, she should suffer me to relate
the steps by which, under the ministration of
M. Gardein, the change in my sentiments had been
wrought. By degrees she began herself to share
those doubts which had first weaned me from monastic
observances, and then shaken my faith in the
dogmas of Rome. I lived in hope that at no far
distant day she would embrace the purer faith
which formed the comfort of my life; and at any
rate she gave me reason to think that her determination
was well nigh fixed to unite her lot with
mine. All at once a cruel, though hardly an unlooked-for
interruption was given to these prospects.
Her uncle, a bigoted Catholic, and not many years
older than herself, arrived at St. Gingoulph, with
the authority of her mother, and bade her prepare
to accompany him home. The education of poor
Emilie in the same convent with her, and the belief
that she was secretly a Romanist, had alone reconciled
the family of Orange to Louise's residing so
long in the house of a Protestant pastor; and when

<!-- vol 2 page 39 -->

that reason ceased to exist, her stay there could no
longer be allowed.</p>

<p>"No sooner did I hear of M. Crenelle's intended
arrival, than all my visions of happiness
fled. The delightful month which had passed
over my head like a morning dream, its sweets no
sooner tasted than gone, was succeeded by a period
of bitter vexation, not unmingled with alarm. First
I had to conceal myself carefully from this uncle,
who might make inquiries attended with the risk
of discovery. Next I was told by M. Girard, that
in his manner to his niece there was something of
marked attention not calculated to quiet my fears
of what awaited Louise when we should be separated;
for, by the Romish law of marriage, a dispensation
legalizes an union between uncle and niece
as easily as between first cousins. This consideration,
if he really aspired to her hand, and was approved
by her surviving parent, his sister, was sure
to make her conversion to Protestantism still more
hateful in the family, much as, independently of any
such consideration, it was sure to be disapproved.
Watched as she now was, it became hardly possible
for us to meet; and the only hour I passed
with her before her departure was when one day

<!-- vol 2 page 40 -->

M. Crenelle accompanied the pastor to see the
waterfall above St. Meurice, called the Pisse-Vache.
That hour was spent in solemn promises of eternal
fidelity, and above all in her plighting her faith
at once to declare that she was a Protestant if her
family should insist upon the match we both contemplated
with equal horror and disgust. This was
resolved upon as a measure of protection, although
at that time she was still far from having renounced
Popery.</p>

<p>"All interviews of lovers, and indeed all their
intercourse, their meetings and their separations,
their endearments and their alarms, their alternate
raptures and discontents, are and have been from
the beginning of time alike; they are moreover
sufficiently monotonous from the circumstance that
they necessarily turn on one subject, and that when
the passions are strong or the feelings acute, they
will admit of no interruption from other topics.
Nor indeed could Petrarch with all his ingenuity
and labour have contrived to make tolerable, if
indeed it be tolerable even with the divine sweetness
of his diction, this endless dwelling for near three
hundred sonnets on the same theme, had he been so
exclusively filled with the passion he is describing,

<!-- vol 2 page 41 -->

and not worked with his head rather than his heart.
He was forced to introduce anything but love, and
then connect it with that by some far-fetched link;
and even after all, who can read above a sonnet or
two at a sitting? The truth is that love-scenes and
love-letters are always highly interesting to two
individuals, and wholly uninteresting to all the world
besides. Therefore I will not weary you with reciting
what you are aware must have passed at our
last interview, with the pains of our separation, with
the sorrowful loneliness which succeeded, with the
hope of again meeting.</p>

<p>"The first effect of Louise's departure was to
bring back the melancholy in which Emilie's death
had plunged me, and this was most unpleasingly
checkered with the alarms I felt about my own
safety; for it is not with grief as with love: when
love is our master, it exalts the spirits, and it will
bear no rival near its throne, be it fear or be it
prudence: when sorrow depresses us, it admits the
fellowship of all other painful emotions; its chill
makes way for the chill of fear; and while we are
weeping for others, we can easily tremble for ourselves.</p>

<p>"Once more, then, I felt all eyes turned upon

<!-- vol 2 page 42 -->

me and trying to penetrate my disguise. Each
time I saw a strange face in the neighbourhood,
some person seemed to have arrived in search of
me. If M. Girard was suddenly called out I never
stopped to consider it might be for the purpose of some
parish duty; he was sent to be interrogated as to
me. If he remained out an hour later than usual, I
ascribed it not to his fatigue in the summer heat, or
to the length of his visit to some sick or some dying
person, but straightway concluded that he had met
suspicious persons, or heard bad news which he
dreaded to communicate. My relief on finding
these alarms groundless was not such as to make
compensation for the pain they had given me while
they lasted; for no sooner was one apprehension laid
to rest than another awoke to disturb me. I remember
well seeing a man hastily cross the garden
and run into M. Girard's study, having a staff in
his hand; I never doubted it was an officer of
justice, and fled towards the lake, hardly knowing
what I did. It was only the clerk, an elderly man
whose person I well knew; and who came in a hurry
to fetch the pastor that he might christen a child
not expected to live.</p>

<p>"In one instance however there was much more

<!-- vol 2 page 43 -->

of reality in the circumstance which tormented me,
and, strange to tell, I felt then far less acutely than
in the other cases. M. Gardein wrote that suspicions
had been excited respecting the long visit which an
unknown person had paid his brother-in-law; and
that an official person belonging to Avignon had
heard from his brother in Vevay, of a clergyman
living at the pastor's in St. Gingoulph, yet who
never had been known to preach for him, or to do
any professional duty in the place. The good man
desired me without any delay to leave the neighbourhood
and go into Germany, at a distance from the
French frontier, so that I might be safe. I cannot
tell why this intelligence alarmed me so little,
except that it was only heard of, and distant, and
connected itself with nothing actually seen and
near.</p>

<p>"My reluctance was extreme to follow the prudent
and provident advice thus given, for I dreaded
as the last of evils the removal from all chance of
ever meeting Louise again. I left her exposed to all
the arts of her uncle and the bigotry of her family;
I dreaded the effects of parental importunity and
of clerical art in bringing her back to a church from
which she was not yet finally severed; and while I

<!-- vol 2 page 44 -->

was wandering in a remote land, she might, in despair
at our ever again meeting, be over-persuaded
to forget me. I was, however, obliged to make up
my mind, and with a heavy heart I set out in company
of a vetturino who was well known to M.
Girard, and who engaged to take me as far as
Zurich. A small sum of money, remitted through
M. Gardein from my poor mother, now heart-broken
by my absence, and indeed by my whole story,
enabled me to subsist until I could obtain some
employment whereby I might earn my bread.</p>

<p>"The journey presented for the first day or two
nothing remarkable, excepting that my companion
seemed exceedingly, and it appeared groundlessly,
afraid of robbers. He was unarmed, however, as
I was, and on my expressing one evening my surprise
at his taking no precautions against a danger he
seemed to dread so much, he told me that he never
had seen any good come of fire-arms, as they are
of no service after a single shot, whereas he always
trusted to a heavy and stout piece of wood 'like
this (he said, handling the thick bough of a tree).
I have more than once thus saved myself when a fellow-traveller
has fired his pistol, missed, and been
laid low.'</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 45 -->

<p>"We took the Lucerne road; and as I passed
through the inn-yard where we stopped, my surprise
was great to see M. Crenelle's name upon a box.
I remembered he had said he should take his niece
to see the Little Cantons before she returned to
Avignon; but I could not understand how so much
time could have been spent in this town; for it was
now nearly three weeks since they had set out. I
soon, however, found they were in the same inn with
me, and that Louise had been seriously ill, which
delayed their journey. The joy which filled me at
thus unexpectedly being in the same place with her,
did not permit me to reckon how short must be its
duration, or how difficult it would be to see her.
Crenelle had not seen me at St. Gingoulph, but his
niece could receive no letter unknown to him, or
which would not excite his suspicions. After long
racking my brain for some means of letting her
know I was at Lucerne, I at last thought of calling
to ask if she would buy a spar, of which I had
picked up some fragments on the road. These I
placed on a piece of paste-board, with labels, and
presented myself in the room when her uncle had
gone to look after his horse in the stable. We were
at once alone, and as instantaneously in each other's

<!-- vol 2 page 46 -->

arms. She had only time to apprize me that, as
she was now well enough to travel, they intended
setting out next morning for Zug. This lay in my
vetturino's road, so it was arranged that I should
there call with my spars, as this device had been
unnecessary at Lucerne. But later in the evening,
as I stood in the court-yard of the inn, I heard M.
Crenelle giving orders for a char-au-banc to take
him next morning to see the lake; and finding his
plans changed, I prevailed on my vetturino to delay
setting out until the following day. I then resolved
to follow the char-au-banc, and was delighted to see
Louise get into it with her uncle. They went on
and embarked; I got into a boat which was leaving
the shore to carry passengers to Brunnen, where we
arrived long before M. Crenelle.</p>

<p>"The whole of the scenery here is most striking,
and the contrast of some mountains green to their
summits, with others wholly composed of barren
rock, of fertile plains like that near Brunnen,
wholly covered with fruit-trees, with a forest, and
precipitous slopes like walls of bare rocks, or
mountains whose sides are covered with foliage
down to the water's edge, like those on the banks
of the Uri branch of the lake, presents a view that

<!-- vol 2 page 47 -->

no one can ever forget the effect of, when his eyes
first have dwelt upon it. Even agitated as I was
with so many hopes and fears, I could not help
being deeply interested with this noble scenery.
The other boat soon reached Brunnen; and while
M. Crenelle was ordering his breakfast, I was
delighted to see Louise walk out through a cherry-orchard
towards the lake. I hastily followed, and as
I passed ascertained that they were next morning to
leave Lucerne, she supposed for Zug, as had at first
been settled. While lingering to converse with her,
I observed Crenelle following, and I instantly moved
on. But it was too late; he imperiously asked who
I was, and she answered a person she had known at
St. Gingoulph, and who had offered her some spars
for sale. This barely satisfied him; and we separated.
I took my way on foot back to Lucerne,
and arrived late in the evening. A violent storm of
thunder and lightning had driven me for shelter
into a cabin, where I obtained some refreshment:
but it prevented Louise from returning before nightfall,
and I could not be sure that she would be able
to continue her journey next day. This anxiety
kept me awake; but on rising very early I found
my vetturino in conversation with Crenelle's, and

<!-- vol 2 page 48 -->

learnt from him that he expected to set out. I
also ascertained the inn at Zug in which he was to
put up.</p>

<p>"At six we set out; and reached Zug before
evening. We stopped at a different inn from the one
named. I soon went to inquire if they had arrived,
and found they had not. But lingering near the
premises for about an hour, I saw them come, and
soon afterwards M. Crenelle came out to make
some inquiry about the road. Unfortunately he perceived
me, and his look was one of suspicion as well
as displeasure. I left the spot; but seeing him go
out apparently towards St. Oswald's church to vespers,<sup id="r014"><a href="#n014">14</a></sup>
I ventured to return after making some circuit
to avoid his perceiving my design. I had not, however,
knocked at the door of the apartment when he
came up the stairs, and asked me in a rude tone
what I was doing there. I said I thought he or
the young lady might have some commands for St.

<!-- vol 2 page 49 -->

Gingoulph, where I proposed to return. 'None
whatever,'&mdash;was his surly reply, accompanied by
an assurance that I could not see her. I retired
discomfited. There was no chance of my again
being suffered to see Louise, and I could only
ascertain that they went to Zurich next day, and
that their vetturino used the same inn with mine.
Pushed to impatience and almost despair at the
prospect of seeing her no more, I imprudently made
my vetturino ask theirs to let her know of my being
in the Zurich inn next evening, and of my intention
to walk in the church at vespers. He accomplished
this with secrecy and success. When I had taken
a few turns in the centre aisle, I saw her leaning on
the maid of the inn, and going towards one of the
side altars. She had hardly time to mention that
they went the next day but one to Basil, when
Crenelle entered the church, accompanied by an
officer of police. He no sooner saw me than he
gave me in charge to the man. My alarm may
well be conceived. I never doubted that I was
discovered, and I prepared for the event. What
he said to the sergent-de-ville, I could not hear,
except 'That's he&mdash;seize him&mdash;do your duty.' I
accompanied him, and was taken to his house, the

<!-- vol 2 page 50 -->

magistrate's office being shut. It was most fortunate
for me that the officer was a zealous Protestant,
and after listening to the story I thought fit to tell
him of my being persecuted as a Reformed pastor,
he took upon him to let me escape. I went towards
Waldshut the same evening, slept at a wretched
country inn; and in an unfrequented part of the road
next morning, taking off my late disguise, I put on
again my peasant's dress, which I carried with me
in a bundle, with the few other clothes I possessed,
and which amounted but to a single shirt and a pair
of stockings. It was now, however, impossible
Crenelle should again know me, and accordingly
when I traced him to his inn at Basil, and had given
one of the last livres I possessed for a bed and
supper, I had the satisfaction of seeing Louise walking
out leaning on his arm, and I contrived to look
her steadily in the face as she returned following
him at a few paces distant. Her look at once
showed she recognized me. But whether there was
something nervous in her manner on reaching their
apartment, or whether the rumour had reached him
of my escaping from the officer at Zurich, he was
plainly upon the alert, and full of suspicion. He
accordingly left Zurich early next day; I caught a

<!-- vol 2 page 51 -->

glimpse of Louise as she entered the carriage of a
new vetturino, whom I had not made acquaintance
with; I followed as long as I could keep up with
them; they disappeared in a crowded part of the
street; and I had no means of even guessing which
road they took. That glimpse caught as she passed,
and which I know not if she was aware of, is the
last I had of Louise for seven long years after the
dismal day I spent in Basil on losing sight of her
carriage.</p>

<p>"How many a time during these wearisome
years of exile and of wandering, in the lonely forest,
among the unfeeling stranger, in the silent watches
of the night, pining it may be with want, or stretched
on a sick bed&mdash;how many a time have I asked myself
if it really was come to this, that I should never
see Louise more? 'Is it gone,' I have said, 'all the
hope of brighter days than once cheered my path,
and seemed to make its darkness lightsome, and to
bruise the thorns beneath my feet? Are they fled
forever, those pleasing visions on which the troubled
mind could dwell and find repose? Never more
am I to see those eyes which lighted up with pure
affection as often as they turned on me, or hear the

<!-- vol 2 page 52 -->

warblings of a voice sweeter than ever awaked the
grove? Must I resign all prospect of happiness on
earth, because a cruel superstition, doing violence
to the first laws of our nature, is enthroned in a
despotic church, as intolerant as it is dogmatical,
which the whole power of the State maintains
in its sovereignty over the Crown and over the
nation, to sow falsehoods broad-cast, to keep the
mind in thraldom, to vex the body, to destroy the
soul?'</p>

<p>"But it was all in vain to repine," added Albert,
"and still it is in vain. The time may yet come
when the diffusion of sounder knowledge than
priests will allow to be taught, may teach men the
truth, and awaken nations to a sense of their rights.
When that day comes, men will no longer be found
to people the cloister with lazy herds, muttering
the incantations of their superstition under the cowl.
The dross of religion, man's worst bane, will be separated
from its pure gold, his most precious inheritance.
The unholy alliance of Church and State
against the happiness and the rights of the people,
will be dissolved;&mdash;and I shall no longer be a fugitive
and an outlaw.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 53 -->

<p>"I resume my narrative of those long and dismal
wanderings in which I so often revolved sentiments
like these, sorrows, bitter sorrows, sometimes, but
rarely, relieved by faint gleams of hope.</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="small">THE WANDERER.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">When</span> I had lost the last hope of rejoining Louise,
it remained for me to go whither I could in order
to consult my safety and to find such employment
as might afford me bread and shelter. I did not
hesitate long in choosing a country where literary
acquirements, however humble, are secure of a market
for whatever they may produce, be it of ever so
coarse a fabric. I went into Germany, and I soon
was put in a way of earning a moderate weekly payment
as a translator from the English and Italian,
with both of which languages I was well acquainted.
German I knew but indifferently; however, by help
of the little I knew and by the universal diffusion of
my mother tongue, I was enabled to complete my
translation for use, that is, for the press. In that
country, where the division of literary labour is
perfect, and the manufacture of books has become

<!-- vol 2 page 55 -->

almost mechanical, one man could do my French,
or my mixed German and French, into good Saxon
who knew no English, nor Italian, and a small deduction
was made from the price I charged for the
translation, in order to pay for his work. I tried an
original work, but it did not answer; my fancy was
too much under the restraint of critical rules, my
style was too much formed on the chaste models of
my own country, to suit the appetite for wonders and
horrors, vehement excitement and unnatural situation,
fantastic sentiment and strange opinion, which
seemed to be so prevalent in the constitution of the
Germanic mind. Besides, I could receive very little
more for a critical dissertation or a romance, than
for a translation from some well known foreign
author. Again, there was frequently no demand
at all for my original productions, not to mention
that I was not at all times in a humour of mind to
execute them; and in the employment of a literary
man, nothing is of such importance as a constant
supply of work and of a kind which he can at all
times perform. The nearer he brings his work to
the common kinds of day labour, the labour at least
of artizans, the better for him. He is not paid the
worse in the long run, and he toils with comparative

<!-- vol 2 page 56 -->

ease. The evils of a literary life resolve themselves
almost entirely into the ups and downs of
imaginative composition, the uncertainty of finding
a demand for exertions of genius, the greater uncertainty
of being able to make these exertions, the
occasional idleness and consequent want which are
the result. Hence the anxieties, the sufferings, the
various fortunes, the too often unequal spirits, even
the recourse to dissipation for relief, which chequer
the lives of literary men.</p>

<p>"As my wants were exceedingly limited, I could
live by my pen, though I was paid less than many
mechanics gained by their labour; for I never could
exceed, and seldom quite reached, twenty rix-thalers<sup id="r015"><a href="#n015">15</a></sup>
a month. But I enjoyed in quiet a rather agreeable
literary society among the Germans of G&ouml;ttingen,
where I took up my abode; and I soon became
familiar with the respectable character of that honest,
single-hearted, well-natured, though somewhat
coarse and not a little fantastical people. One of
the first things that struck me in their literary condition
with which my avocations naturally brought
me most acquainted, was the mechanical state into
which authorship was come, and the recklessness

<!-- vol 2 page 57 -->

with which authors would undertake works. The
last thing they dreamt of was a conformity to
Horace's rule of first calculating their own strength,
and avoiding a load which their shoulders refused
to bear. A middleman between the publisher and
the author, like a regrater between the hop-grower
and the hop-merchant or the brewer, a <i>verlager</i>,
they called him, would come round to make bargains,
buying up the MS. which was ready written,
or else setting authors to write. Those who
wanted a vent for their written works, or sought
employment and could not wait till applied to,
being unemployed, would go to some <i>verlager</i> and
make their bargains. When an offer was made to
an author by the <i>verlager</i>, he only seemed to regard
the terms, the time allowed, and the money to be
paid for his work, never to consider whether he
could well do it or not; while the <i>verlager</i> on his
part, though he would try to find persons capable of
doing the work he wanted, yet continually made
mistakes; and when there was a demand for a particular
book, would not be very nice as to the qualifications
of the writer he engaged with, knowing that
if he got it less well done he paid the less for it.
I have repeatedly seen men undertake in this way

<!-- vol 2 page 58 -->

to write, let me rather say to make books, on subjects
they knew hardly anything of. Once I recollect
one of our club-fellows, who used to smoke his meerschaum
and drink his ale with us of an evening,
being rallied on the gross blunders in an Algebraical
Treatise which he was known to have written, though
it came forth under a feigned name. His defence was
comical enough. 'How should it be otherwise? I
knew nothing of mathematics.'&mdash;'But then why did
you undertake it?'&mdash;'Why did I undertake it? Would
you have refused two rix dollars a sheet, which the
<i>verlager</i>, Hans Meyer, offered me, on condition of it
being finished in six weeks?'&mdash;'Then how did you
do it with no more blunders, if you knew no mathematics?'&mdash;'I
had two treatises, Euler and Maclorren,<sup id="r016"><a href="#n016">16</a></sup>
which were lent me; the former, in German,
I abridged easily, making of course some cruel mistakes;
the latter in English I had some help from,
through the tailor I lodged with, who had been a
journeyman in London for some years; so that in
what I took from Maclorren, I made more blunders
still. But I did my work to the day, and

<!-- vol 2 page 59 -->

received no less than forty rix-dollars for six weeks'
work.'</p>

<p>"I must give the Germans every praise for industry.
They labour harder and more conscientiously
in every thing they undertake than any people
I have ever been among. There is no comparison
in this respect between them and the French, though
these certainly come next. For patient industry,
joined with temperance and economy, the German
stands first; the Frenchman next for both. The
labour of the former is more unremitting, longer
continued, more passive, if I may so speak, more
machine-like, less relieved by fancy, less stimulated
by impetuosity. The latter works very hard too,
and for an extraordinary length of time, compared
with any but a German. His labour, however, is
more desultory, more prompted by passion, and,
therefore, less equally sustained; his industry is
warmed by the fire of his temperament; and instead
of loving work for work's sake like the Gothic artist,
the Celtic performer toils for fame, feels all the
while that he is immortalizing himself, and never
doubts that in whatever drudgery he may be employed,
be it only in making an index, or correcting
the press, or abridging another's book, the whole

<!-- vol 2 page 60 -->

success of the work depends on himself, just as each
actress who plays the soubrette's part thinks the
whole fortune of the piece rests upon her performance,
and just as each soldier at a review considers
that he is the pivot on which the whole man&oelig;uvres
of the day turn. Happy people, to live in so pleasing
a delusion! But, happy country, to have its
offices filled, its armies recruited, its fleets manned
by myriads of such enthusiasts! Less felicitous its
lot in times of trouble and change, when the mercurial
temperament, the exciteable nature is prone
to display its force, and no work of mischief can
ever be without leaders, no incendiary leader ever
want followers in doing the deeds of destruction!</p>

<p>"There is in the German character, according
to my observation, a certain slowness, a reluctance to
leave the beaten track; but it is in practical matters;
or, if it be a general character of the Teutonic
understanding, we must ascribe the strange vagaries
of theory and of sentiment into which it plunges, to
the effects of an unnatural state, the extremes to
which men will go when they once break through
their habitual modes of thinking or of acting. Certain
it is that no people, generally speaking, are
more prone to go on as those have done who lived

<!-- vol 2 page 61 -->

before them. Witness the slowness with which they
have embraced improvements in the art of war. and
the number of times that Frederick II. defeated his
enemies by the new tactics, the great scheme of
man&oelig;uvres he introduced, and which the Dauns and
the Laudohns were never beaten into adopting.</p>

<p>"To deny the Germans genius, as some superficial
reasoners have done, misled by a heavy exterior
and the miracles of a plodding nature, both
the one and the other so manifest to the eye, is wholly
absurd. Shall we look to the highest subjects, to the
sublimer of the sciences, where, except in the country
of Newton, do we find such discoveries as those by
which Leibnitz gave, like Newton and with Newton,
the key to all modern mathematical research,
and Kepler and Copernicus first expounded the
system of the universe? Is poetry our care, and
can we forget G&ouml;the and Klopstock? In music
who have surpassed Haydn and Mozart? Painting
alone furnishes any exception; though he who
denies Rubens to be a German because his family
was Flemish, must deny Holbein to be a Switzer
because his family was German.</p>

<p>"I have spoken of the effects produced by deviations
from the nature of men, or violent breaches of

<!-- vol 2 page 62 -->

habit, their second nature. The women of Germany,
perhaps, furnish the materials of a similar remark,
in illustration of the Latin saying, that the corruption
of the best things makes the worst. The
German female is naturally pure, chaste, strict;
when she deviates from her appointed path, she falls
low indeed; her abandonment exceeds the grovelling,
the wallowing, of less virtuous natures.</p>

<p>"I have heard the sobriety of the Germans called in
question, and on the Rhine they perhaps drink more
wine than the men of some other nations, all those of
the south, as of the Spanish and Italian peninsulas, of
course being abstemious in the greatest degree. But
the general beverage of Germany is beer, and though
with their tobacco a good deal of this is consumed,
I never saw reason to doubt that the German was
sufficiently sober, as he is past all doubt rigidly
economical. Indeed, after passing some months in
that country, I never either saw or heard of any
person who did not live within his means. Having
money, the German will indulge, but only in moderation;
and if he have but a rix-dollar in his pocket,
he will only spend three marcs.</p>

<p>"In a country so full of authors, and so fruitful
in productions of the press, it was plain that the

<!-- vol 2 page 63 -->

number of readers must be prodigious; nor was it
uninteresting to observe that a vast variety of subjects
were treated of in their writings so generally
read. The speculations of science, and the works
on <i>belles lettres</i>, were by no means the only ones,
not even the principal ones, diffused through the
country. History, above all recent history, biography,
and of living persons, moral and metaphysical
controversy, these often plunging into the most
cloudy and abstract mysticism, jurisprudence, even
political philosophy, theology, mixed with fierce
controversy on all important and on many very trivial
points&mdash;all these formed the catalogue weekly
printed at G&ouml;ttingen of new publications, and all
these furnished food for the labours of the critics and
abridgers who had lately set up daily reviews, the
former weekly ones proving insufficient to keep pace
with the hourly growing crop of books and pamphlets
which shot up in so rank a soil, so peopled with
hard-working cultivators. The great number of
petty principalities into which the empire is divided
gives a stimulus to the products of the press, and also
affords security to those who live by it; they can
move from place to place if in any jeopardy from
the freedom of their pens; and some of the princes,

<!-- vol 2 page 64 -->

and still more of the ministers, were in those days
known to encourage very free opinions upon all subjects.
Indeed no two of the petty sovereigns were
likely to agree on any point, and still less were such
near neighbours, lords of such contracted dominions,
capable of living in much amity one with another.
Add to all these circumstances, the effect of the
Reformed faith, wherever it was established, in
emancipating the human mind and causing reason
alone to be consulted in all controversial matters.</p>

<p>"It cannot be denied that this state of things was
sure to spread among the people a love of freedom,
and give them a spirit of inquiry into all existing institutions,
and their abuses as well as their foundations.
The American revolution had recently produced
a great effect in the same direction, and even
the Hessian and other troops who had been hired
by England to fight against the rising liberties of
her colonial subjects, did not cross the Atlantic, or
write to their families, or return when paid off to
their homes, without bringing notions of a very free
kind to spread among their untravelled countrymen.
I had not been long at G&ouml;ttingen when I found that
there was a considerable ferment among the people
in many parts of the Empire, and not merely in the

<!-- vol 2 page 65 -->

Protestant parts, for I should say Munich had fully
more of it than either Leipsic or G&ouml;ttingen. But
what interested me more was the associations which
I found were formed, and chiefly in university towns,
among the young men, but to which no small number
of the elderly university men, and even the
professors, belonged. Some of these societies were
merely public bodies that openly held meetings for
discussing literary, historical, or scientific subjects;
with which were occasionally mingled political controversies.
But others were of a concealed and
mysterious character; no one knew who belonged to
them; their places of meeting were only revealed
to the initiated; and the members recognized one
another by secret signs. I was, after a short intimacy
with a literary man older than myself, and
after many minute examinations of my character,
and inquiries into my past history, which I answered
as best I could, admitted into one of these associations.
It was called the <i>Fehm-gerichte</i>, or <i>Fehm-ding</i>,
borrowing its name from a famous secret
tribunal in Westphalia, established during the middle
ages for the enforcement of criminal justice and
police, and which was wont to execute capital sentences
occasionally on offenders, as well as on those

<!-- vol 2 page 66 -->

of its own body who betrayed its secrets. The plans
of the society I belonged to soon unfolded themselves
to my mind; having been carefully concealed
from me until I had bound myself by an awful oath,
borrowed like the name from the Fehm-gerichte,&mdash;an
oath binding me 'by the death which God endured
on the cross, to keep the holy secrets from wife and
child, from father and mother, from sister and
brother, from fire and wind, from all the sun shines
on, or the rain falls on, from all between sky and
ground, and especially from the man who knows the
law.'&mdash;When I had thus become bound, and furthermore
had taken the equally solemn oath of implicit
and unhesitating obedience to my unknown chiefs, I
was gradually allowed to know that the designs of
the society were utterly incompatible with the security
of the established government or the established
church. Wild and levelling doctrines of a purely
republican nature were freely discussed and were
largely inculcated upon the newly admitted members;
and the task of zealously aiding in the dissemination
of these, both in society, by teaching,
through the press, and by all manner of influence,
personal, professional, official, was prescribed as the
first of duties. The evils under which society as

<!-- vol 2 page 67 -->

at present constituted labours, formed the favourite
subject of declamation at all our meetings; the
glorious prospect of its entire regeneration under
the establishment of a more pure, more free, more
philosophical system, was the pleasing hope held
out to encourage our labours.</p>

<p>"When I found these refined speculations planted
in the minds of enthusiasts, and producing fruits of
a very exciting and most practical kind, I own my
alarm became considerable. For nothing was more
common than to hear mention made of vengeance
which must be exacted from some one who was suspected
of betraying the Society, and on whom a strict
watch was therefore set, the office of superintending
him being confided to some intimate friend whom he
little suspected of such vigilance. Nor was this all.
There were certain persons in authority whom the
concealed rulers of our body were said to have found
counteracting their proceedings, spying into their
meetings, and even endeavouring to discover their persons.
One and another of these public functionaries
was successively named in our meetings as closely
watched, and their doom was said to be inevitable
were they found to have really done what was imputed.
It seemed quite plain to me, however carefully

<!-- vol 2 page 68 -->

wrapped up in general expressions, that assassination
was one of the means contemplated as possibly
to be used; in extreme cases no doubt, in order to
render it safe and prevent the consequences from
the active exertions of the government, but still an
instrument reserved to be used on those great occasions.</p>

<p>"At length I was allowed to be present at the
initiation of one person, whose absolute devotion to
the order was deemed an important object from the
rank he filled at a neighbouring court; while the
great, the more than German enthusiasm of his
character gave every hope of his falling an easy
victim to the society's designs, and yielding to the
yoke sought to be imposed on him. At the dead of
the night, and in the inmost recesses of an old house
in the thicket, of a neighbouring wood, we assembled
in no great numbers, only about twenty being present.
A short but very striking lecture on the new
duties of the neophyte, and above all on the absolute
devotion demanded of him to the will of his
concealed superiors, was now delivered, while all
stood uncovered. The oath of implicit obedience
was then pronounced with great solemnity, and to
that he swore obedience on his bare knees. Hitherto

<!-- vol 2 page 69 -->

he had only gone through the same ceremonies
which attended my own admission two months
before. While he remained kneeling, an exhortation
was addressed to him in much the same tone;
and a chorus of the most pleasing voices then struck
up a beautiful hymn, accompanied by a fine though
small organ which a brother played, and played
well. The newly initiated was then directed to rise,
and asked what punishment he expected for treachery
to the order in breach of his oath. He answered as
he was bid&mdash;'Instant death, without knowing from
what hand.'&mdash;Again he was asked what would be
his punishment for refusing obedience to the commands
of the secret superiors, in breach of his oath?
He gave the same answer.&mdash;He was now told that
the time had come when his virtue must be tried;
he trembled visibly; but answered, 'Lead on!' He
was taken, and we accompanied him, into the next
room, more dimly lighted, where he saw his own
brother bound to a stake with his shirt off, loaded
with irons, and in a posture of supplication. The
commands of the invisible tyrants were then read
with a loud voice. He was ordered to put the
victim of stern justice to death, as one who had been
treacherous to the order&mdash;'That the weakness of

<!-- vol 2 page 70 -->

human nature be spared,' said the president rising
from his seat, 'your eyes may be bandaged while
you perform your duty according to the obligation
of your oath.'&mdash;He shrunk and seemed ready to
faint away; he was blindfolded; he was led up to
the victim; a dagger was placed in his right hand;
he was bid to feel with his left where the heart beat
and so to direct his blow; he convulsively grasped
the dagger; and with a loud scream plunged it in.
Loud acclamations rose from all present but me;
the bandage was removed from his eyes; it was
found that, he had slain a lamb with the wool shorn,
and mouth muzzled; and he was covered with the
poor creature's blood. But no one who saw this
shocking spectacle could hesitate to believe that in a
moral sense, at least, the guilt of murder had been
incurred; that his brother's blood lay heavy upon his
soul; and that if this trial did not open his eyes and
effect the cure of his enthusiasm, it had prepared
him, or proved him already prepared, for the last
extremities of cruelty, in blind obedience wholly
resigned to the sovereign will of an unknown master.</p>

<p>"It should seem that some look of mine, new as
I was to such scenes, had not escaped the watchful
eyes by which I was surrounded; and the conversation

<!-- vol 2 page 71 -->

which followed led me to express my sentiments
upon the lawfulness of the doctrines that
seemed so generally diffused among the initiated.
The wrongs I had suffered, and continued to endure
under a tyrannical system, civil and religious, had prepared
my mind to seek the overthrow of established
institutions; for, as the good pastor of Nismes had
observed, with the facility of self-deception which
the passions, those consummate casuists, possess, we
always cast upon others the blame of our own actions,
as we always flatter ourselves that our worst deeds
are necessary to our self-defence. Yet I was not
prepared to attempt, or join in attempting, the much
wished-for change, by all and by any means, and I
had suffered too severely from the spilling of blood
to be indifferent upon embracing so dreadful an
extremity. This feeling naturally marked my conversation
more after the midnight rehearsal for
scenes of slaughter, the <i>murder-drill</i>, as I rashly
termed it to a brother. Among the Germans at
large all speculative opinions are freely ventilated,
and all opposition to prevailing belief is fully tolerated;
but when men are bound in a secret conspiracy,
the case is otherwise, and mistrust becomes
the consequence of any difference upon fundamental

<!-- vol 2 page 72 -->

articles of the common faith. The imbuing
the initiated with feelings as vehement as the principles
of the association were extravagant, feelings
powerful enough to counteract the strongest sentiments
of our nature, was the main object of those
able men who projected the Fehm-gerichte; and
when it was found that my heart still beat to other
measures, the inference immediately followed that I
had been prematurely admitted to the inmost mysteries,
and should have been stopped in my progress,
with a <i>Sta bene</i>, outside the threshold of their temple.
It was soon clear to me that I was very closely
watched. I perceived some one of the brethren
always threw himself in my way wheresoever I
went. I never could be alone an instant, hardly
when I was at my daily work; one or other would
make a pretence of his bed-room being taken from
him and come to read or write in mine. At last
one, most intimate with me, brought a dismal story
of his losing some money, and being no longer able
to pay his room-rent, it was necessary he should
have a bed put up in mine, or he could sleep on the
floor. If ever I was seen speaking but for a moment
to any uninitiated person, some brother was at
my elbow as if to listen. I seldom sent any letter

<!-- vol 2 page 73 -->

to the post-office; but now and then I received one
from M. Girard, to whom the secret of my retreat
was known, and who wrote to me under the name of
Henri Claire. The director of the post had a son
in the office who was one of the initiated, and I perceived
that my letters were opened. Happily they
contained nothing of moment: but one that I had
written to M. Gardein immediately after the drill
at the lone house, contained my confession of having
been present, expressed how it had weighed on my
mind, and though it forbade him to make any remarks
on it when he should write, yet gave a plain
intimation of my resolution to quit the Fehm-gerichte,
and leave G&ouml;ttingen also. Perceiving that a letter
of M. Girard's had been opened, I could not doubt
that this of mine had likewise been seen; indeed,
when I recollected, I found that the brother had
taken up his abode with me the same evening. I
became now beyond measure anxious; never doubting
that the first word which escaped me in presence
of a stranger, nay, the first rash word I might be
overheard to speak in my sleep, would be the signal
for what was called 'executing justice,' and that I
should be found dead in my bed with some circumstances
provided to show that I had destroyed myself.</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 74 -->

<p>"The brethren, however, took another course.
Resolved to make themselves secure from any disclosure
of mine, and determined to do so by my
effectual removal, they had set all their energies
at work to trace my whole history. I soon found
that they knew my name was not Claire, and that I
had in Switzerland gone by another appellation.
They knew moreover that I had personated a
Protestant pastor; and as I had, in obtaining admission,
disclosed my having been converted from
Romanism, the acquaintance with the language of
the Cont&acirc;t which one of them had from having
many years before been educated at Avignon, led
them to the discovery of my having come from
thence. I could not even be certain that my whole
history was any longer a secret among them.
Certain it is that once or twice when I gave vent to
my feelings and scruples on assassination, I was met,
and cruelly met, with the observation that if one
man could destroy his rival in a fit of mere jealousy,
another might possibly make up his mind to do as
much for his country and his kind by laying low
a tyrant or a persecutor. There seemed to me
some reference to myself in this, though it was said
in an argument of a general nature. I began to

<!-- vol 2 page 75 -->

believe that the Fehm-gerichte were taking their
measures for having me seized and delivered up to
the French authorities. I became inexpressibly
anxious in consequence; and a circumstance soon
occurred that left no longer any doubt on my
mind. The necessity for moving from G&ouml;ttingen,
and again trusting to chance for concealment and
subsistence, became apparent; but the blow was
accompanied with a most pleasing compensation,
which shed oil into the wound it made.</p>

<p>"It was the afternoon of a day in July, when I
walked out in the gardens that surround the town,
and was straying towards a stream where I used
sometimes to angle for small fish, or to sit and
smoke a pipe towards nightfall. The day had
been extremely rainy, and even stormy; and when
a fine evening succeeds such a day, and the storm
is hushed, I know nothing more refreshing. The
heats have been allayed; the flowers regain their
fragrance; no dust flies about; every thing is fresh,
and there is a peculiar balminess in the air, which
highly pleases the senses. While enjoying this
walk, I was overtaken by our post-office brother,
who brought me a letter with M. Girard's handwriting
on the back. I thanked him, and put it in

<!-- vol 2 page 76 -->

my pocket, wishing to examine the seal. He soon
went away, finding me little disposed to keep up
the conversation he had tried to begin. I hurried to
the stone seat where I often went to meditate at
eventide, and I thought I could perceive no marks
of the letter having been opened, for it was protected
by a wafer under the wax, and this appearing
round the edges of the seal, had probably scared the
brother from his attempt upon it, and reduced him
to the device of himself delivering it, and endeavouring
to discover whence it came. As soon as I
opened it, I perceived the well known hand of
Louise on the inclosure, and could hardly contain
my joy. Three months had now elapsed since I
parted from her, and I had but faint hopes of hearing
from her again. Her letter was fitted to fill
me with rapture; I devoured it again and again;
its alarming tidings were not sufficient to damp
the joy its perusal shot through my whole frame;
it was the only subject of my reading, and my
thoughts for that night; it disturbed, but not unpleasingly,
my rest, and it has been the cherished
companion of my way in all the after wanderings
and vicissitudes of my stormy life. Here is that
precious relic of true love,"&mdash;said the Solitary, as

<!-- vol 2 page 77 -->

<!--

ERRATA.

-->

he plucked it from his bosom, worn and in parts
all but defaced, hid in a pocket-book of which it
was the only tenant.&mdash;"Here it is, and you, Count,
may yourself peruse it. I know it by heart."&mdash;The
Count opened and read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have learnt, my dearest Albert, from the good
pastor with whom I am now on a visit at Nismes,
that your retreat is in Germany, and that M. Girard
can make a letter sure of reaching you living under
your new disguise. I cannot resist the temptation
of conversing for an hour once more with you,
though only on paper and at a distance that seems
impassable. My first object is to warn you that
circumstances have come to my knowledge at
Avignon which show you to be no longer safe in
your present residence, surrounded with associates
of whom we find that one was educated in the
Cont&acirc;t, knows its dialect, and probably has correspondence
with its capital. Fly then elsewhere;
change your disguise once more; be even more
carefully than ever on your guard against rash confidences
and false friends; distrust the post-office
everywhere; write nothing that can betray you;
let no one but M. Gardein and M. Girard know
whither you have fled; and trust to their conveying

<!-- vol 2 page 78 -->

the tidings I most value, to her you best love, her
who loves you with the truest, the most unalterable
affection!</p>

<p>"How delightful, my dearest friend, thus to write
without restraint, thus to pour out my whole heart
to you, thus to show you how entirely it is filled
with your image, and thus, as it were, to breathe
my sighs in your ear! The confidence that reigns
between us two is as perfect as the affection that
knits us together. True, our loves have been
hitherto disastrous; they have been cast and they
have cast our lives into a deep shade, athwart
which but a single gleam of sunshine has ever shot;
yet one blessing has attended them; heaven be
praised, the curse of jealousy has never blighted
them, never for an instant ruffled our souls, since
that one fatal moment when its fury broke out upon
you, and drove you to madness and to crime. Yes,
Albert! far be from me the guilt of veiling over
your fault even from your recollection, which I
fervently pray it may never escape, because I firmly
believe the more bitterly it stings your conscience,
the more hope you may indulge of forgiveness from
the Father of all mercy, the more guiltlessly pass
the remaining days of your trial here below!</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 79 -->

<p>"When I parted from you at Basil, my uncle,
now became my jealous watch, and since my implacable
persecutor, showed plainly that he suspected
me of having met you at St. Gingoulph, and
was not without his apprehensions that you were
still following our steps. If anything could have
more indisposed me to hear his hateful and disgusting
professions of esteem soon assuming a
warmer guise, it was the life of torment his suspicions
made me lead. I became really ill; and I
feigned that I was worse. I made him bring our
excursion to a close. We struck into the road that
leads towards the Rhone, and I arrived exhausted
and wretched at my mother's house. The reception
she gave me showed plainly the tenor of her
brother's letters, and it became necessary that I
should at once declare to her my fixed resolution
never to allow the subject of his attachment, or
pretended attachment, to be mentioned in my presence.
You know how much she loves me; but
her next attachment is to her brother, and my life
has since been one of perpetual vexation. The
cruel and designing man, finding his passion hopeless,
has converted it, by the easy transition from
love to hatred, into the bitterest enmity; and he

<!-- vol 2 page 80 -->

<!--

ERRATA.

Page 80,&mdash;3 from bottom, for rigid read frigid.

-->

never has lost any opportunity of giving me pain.
There is accordingly no more choice subject of
conversation with him than your history. How
often has he made me quit the room with a heaving
bosom, and with ill-restrained tears in my eyes, to
give my sorrow and my indignation vent in the
room where every object, the sofa, the guitar, the
harpsichord, the library, all recall you to my view!
To my mind no such mementos are wanted, for you
never have left it.</p>

<p>"Do you remember, dearest, the beautiful evening
when we strolled to Meillerie arm in arm, and
after reading a few of Julie's letters, threw the book
aside, chilled by the cold rhetoric of a composition
in which all the love that breathes through it comes
from either the head or the senses, and never has
warmed the heart? 'It is not even finely written,'
you said; 'if any one would see how well Jean
Jacques could write French, let him read his Confessions:'
and you promised to select the readable
parts of that wonderful work for my perusal. 'But
at all events,' you said, 'the Nouvelle H&eacute;loise is only
a mixture of gross passion and frigid declamation,
from which the feeling, the sentiment of love is far
away.' Well; you then gave me Pascal's Provincial

<!-- vol 2 page 81 -->

Letters, and bade me often read that great performance;
with another in favour of the Reformed
faith. These have been my companions ever since.
These have constantly occupied my thoughts, together
with the lecture you read me on the lives of
the first Reformers, as an antidote to the arguments
of our priests drawn from them, and for the purpose
of showing how the errors and impurities incident
to those who suddenly cast off the restraints of an
habitual faith, form no reason whatever for distrusting
their reasonings, or disbelieving the facts they
prove by evidence.</p>

<p>"In this frame of mind I have cultivated the society,
the truly edifying society, of M. Gardein and
his amiable family. He has received me more than
once under his humble but hospitable roof. He
has been made the confidant of all my sad history;
of our loves, of our sorrows. My doubts, both on the
Romish and on the Reformed schemes, have been
freely disclosed to him; he has confirmed me in
the one, he has removed the others; and I am now
an openly professed follower of the Protestant faith,
to the extreme grief of my poor mother, and to the
unbounded anger of M. Crenelle.</p>

<p>"How delightful, my dearest friend, was it to

<!-- vol 2 page 82 -->

feel that I was following your steps, conversing with
your pious instructor, receiving from his lips the
same saving lessons wherewith he had chased error
from your mind, and won you over to the right
faith; kneeling with the family in the same parlour
where you had knelt to worship the God of mercy
and of truth! I felt as if we had met once more;
weaned through the same process, and from the same
false doctrines, by the same kindly hand, it seemed
as if, after all our earthly wanderings, storms, and
perils, we had reached together the blessed haven
where peace and rest await us, and where we may
taste them together, to part no more!</p>

<p>"This place is filled with recollections of my
love. His image seems to float even through the
air. When I wander in the beautiful gardens, he
has before been wandering there. When I survey
the fine monuments of ancient arts in the Temple
of Concord, he has before been carried back by the
same remains to the Augustan age of Rome. When
I worship in the holier Temple whose priest is the
venerable pastor, I bend at the same altar where
Albert offered up his penitence and his prayers.
The room I now write in is the one you occupied.
I rest my arm on the desk you wrote on. I see the

<!-- vol 2 page 83 -->

traces of the pen which, the night you left Nismes,
you used to write down the venerable pastor's
wholesome advice; one word reversed by having
been laid on the blotting book, I can yet read in
your well-known hand; it is <i>Providence!</i> Oh, let
me implore that gracious power to guide all your
steps, that gracious mercy to descend on your head!
I fold up this letter with this prayer, breathed from
the bottom of my heart, and I go to lay my head on
that pillow which you, dearest, dearest love, so
often made wet with your tears, as if with them I
could mingle my own!</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="small">THE WAY-FARING MAN.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">It</span> was not so easy as dear Louise imagined to
follow the course which her important warning directed
me to take. Nothing could have given our
brethren so great alarm as the least intimation that
I intended to quit G&ouml;ttingen. The constant watch
set on me made all preparation impossible. Of
this I was soon made aware; for, going to the
office of a diligence where I wished to inquire
about a place, I found my intrusive fellow lodger,
Kr&uuml;tzener, there before me, and the postmaster's
son was with him. The alarm had been given
by my pressing, the morning before, for payment
from my bookseller, of a small sum which he owed
me; and some inquiry I had made in a Dutch
tradesman's shop, as to the nearest way to Holland,
had in an unaccountable way become known. A
small letter-case in which I kept my writings had

<!-- vol 2 page 85 -->

been evidently opened, and it contained a few lines
I had written to M. Girard, mentioning my wish to
leave the place, which I said was become intolerable
to me. What more may have been overheard of my
words while asleep I cannot tell; but it was plain
from Kr&uuml;tzener's altered manner that he was my
enemy as well as the watch upon me. Nevertheless
I resolved to risk everything, and if no other escape
presented itself, to walk away under cloud of night,
and take my chance of getting into the coach
next day by the road side. Before going to bed at
an early hour, which I did on pretence of illness, I
was about to take a cooling draught, when I saw
Kr&uuml;tzener, in the mirror, drop a powder into it.
This was quite enough to prevent me taking it, but
putting it on the night-table, when he left the
room for a few minutes, I contrived to spill it under
the pillow. I then went to bed, and feigning after a
little while to be asleep, I perceived him come with
the lamp in his hand, and holding it near my eyes
he stood silent over me. He turned, believing me
asleep; when, unable to contain myself, I suddenly
rose and sprang upon the assassin, who, being far
less powerful, was easily held in my grasp. Seizing
a knife that lay on the table, I held it at his

<!-- vol 2 page 86 -->

throat, and bade him prepare for the death which
he had intended for me. He sank on his knees, and
earnestly begged his life, pleading in his defence
the dreadful oath he had taken of obedience to
the Unknown, whose peremptory orders were to
remove me, and charge me with having voluntarily
swallowed poison, for which purpose they had found
in my letter-case some lines expressing that I was
weary of life. I released him on one condition;
that he should accompany me to the frontier, in
order that I might be safe from the all-seeing eyes
and all-pervading myrmidons of the Unknown Superiors.
We instantly set out, and after travelling
the greater part of the night, I was overtaken by
a stuhlwagen, or open diligence, into which I got,
leaving the wretched slave to find his way back
as he could.</p>

<p>"Nothing particularly worth remembering occurred
on the way; I only remember well the
feeling of relief which I experienced on finding
myself suddenly freed from the jealous and constant
inspection of the Fehm-gerichte. Secure in
the distance every hour was increasing between me
and their odious thraldom, I little cared for any
attempts which they might make against me, because

<!-- vol 2 page 87 -->

I felt assured they must fail; and I now
seemed to breathe after the intolerable servitude I
had lately been forced to endure; a servitude which
almost abstracted from my mind the fears of being
discovered for what I was. Those fears now returned,
but with less than their former violence;
for I hoped that, as soon as I should reach the
Dutch territory, the protection of a free state would
be extended to me. In the course of a week our
slow-moving vehicle brought us to Emmerich, the
frontier town of the Prussian States, and I panted
to set my foot, for the first time, in a country governed
by a constitution that secured equal rights
to its subjects of all classes. Well did I then remember
the touching picture which Father Jerome
used to paint of the superior virtue that resides in
popular governments. He had a care to temper
his panegyric with an admission of the mischiefs
to which popular excesses lead; but the security of
person and property he justly regarded as a paramount
excellence of this scheme of policy; and the
toleration of the Dutch for all kinds of religious
creeds, he had been wont to commend fully as much
as a strict Catholic could be expected to do, while
he affirmed that the practice of this virtue was

<!-- vol 2 page 88 -->

more conformable to the genius of a Protestant
commonwealth than to the spirit of uniformity required
in a Romish monarchy. The image of the
good man was before my eyes while looking forward
to the emancipation from alarm which I
should feel when I breathed, for the first time, the
republican air of the United Provinces; and filled
with these hopes, saddened by this reminiscence, I
entered Holland, sleeping the first night in Nimeguen,
a town of Guelderland.</p>

<p>"My object was to reach Amsterdam or Rotterdam,
believing I might have a better chance of
obtaining employment in those great towns; a thing
very necessary to me, as the small sum I had compelled
Kr&uuml;tzener to advance (making over to him
my claim on the bookseller) was nearly exhausted
by the expenses, humble as these were, of the week's
journey. I therefore got into a diligence which was
to reach Amsterdam in two days. The conversation
was in French, between a merchant of Brussels
and a commercial traveller. It soon caught
my ear, for it turned on a person who had fled from
the Austrian Netherlands to Holland, on a charge
of forgery; and I found, to my great dismay, that
on the simple requisition of the Austrian minister

<!-- vol 2 page 89 -->

at the Hague, the criminal was sure, if found, to be
delivered up. 'Oh!' said a Dutch gentleman, who
was a fellow-passenger, 'of that there is no doubt.
God forbid that our free country should ever become
the refuge of felons. We might have persons
charged with murder flee hither to infect our soil, and
escape the laws against which they had offended.'&mdash;'Nothing,'
said the Fleming, 'can be more just, Sir,
than your observation. Nor can anything be more
necessary for the purposes of police than a mutual
surrender of fugitives between neighbouring states.'&mdash;'This,'
said the commercial traveller, 'is the more
necessary where, as in Germany, and on the left
bank of the Rhine, the territory is so much divided
into small principalities that an offender can everywhere
escape, in a few hours, across the frontier.
There can hardly be said to be any law, any civilized
society, or any effectual government, where
every one country affords an asylum to the fugitives
from every other.' To all these remarks I
could not refuse my assent; but I felt, cruelly, how
they bore upon my own case; and I began to
foresee that, even were I able to obtain employment
in Holland, I durst not long remain within a

<!-- vol 2 page 90 -->

dominion governed by so wise and just a system
of police.</p>

<p>"I arrived at Amsterdam, once the great capital
of the commercial world, though now far advanced
towards its decline, from the natural rise of other
countries of which Holland had formerly carried
on the trade, sooner or later sure to be domiciled
among themselves. My stock of money was exhausted,
and I lost no time in applying to a bookseller
for employment, never doubting but I should
find myself here on the same footing as in Germany.
The case, however, was widely different. The man
drily told me he had no work for either an author
or a translator; that he sold few books, and these
only the standard works in French, German, and
Dutch; and that all the translations required had
long ago been provided. I asked whether he could
recommend me to any other publisher? He said
they hardly had such a thing as a publisher in
Amsterdam; but if I would call at a shop he
named, where school-books were sold, it was possible
I might find some little thing to do. Thither,
accordingly, I went, and I was told that if for ten
guilders (about a Louis-d'or) I chose to translate

<!-- vol 2 page 91 -->

a small volume of arithmetic and geography, lately
printed in London, for the use of schools, I might
do so. I agreed; and received, in advance, two
guilders. This work took me ten days to do; and
I then sought another kind of employment, as I
plainly could not earn anything like a subsistence
by literary labour in Holland. I wrote a good
hand, could cast accounts, should soon learn enough
of the language to keep the books of some shopkeeper
in a good line of business, whom I might
also help as a shopman, to fill up my time and earn
his wages. After some days spent in seeking for
such a place, I luckily found one at a salary of a
guilder or florin a day and my lodging; I had to
feed myself out of this poor pittance.</p>

<p>"The knowledge I had acquired of English, as
well as German, put a plan into my head which
seemed to promise some more comfortable subsistence,
and to relieve me from the apprehension
I lived in that information from my cruel persecutors
at G&ouml;ttingen might reach the French ambassador,
and that I should be discovered as having
fled from Nismes. A squadron of five sail of the
line and six frigates was about to sail, for the protection
of a merchant fleet expected from the Baltic,

<!-- vol 2 page 92 -->

and among the frigates was a fine American, the
Charlestown, of size almost equal to a ship of the
line. I went on board her, and finding that the
place of captain's clerk was vacant, I immediately
applied for it. I was hired at a salary treble of
what the grocer allowed me at Amsterdam; and,
fear never forming any part of my nature, I cared
not whether I encountered the risks of battle or of
shipwreck. After a few days we sailed; but these
days gave me a pretty complete notion of the change
I had made from the Dutch to the American character
of my associates.</p>

<p>"I had, during the short period of my stay in
Holland, formed an exceedingly favourable opinion
of its people. They are a quiet, orderly, honest
race, extremely averse to all that is adventurous or
riskful, even in their own line, that of commerce;
plodding on in the beaten track, and spurning speculation;
content if they can obtain in safety the
lowest gain on the capital, which is so overgrown as
to bring down profits by almost unlimited competition,
and wisely setting this restricted advantage
against the risk of loss they thus avoid. Regular
and precise in all their habits, they resemble
machines rather than human beings; but they are

<!-- vol 2 page 93 -->

not more regular than conscientious, and they
number economy among their virtues so habitually
that the sight of extravagance offends them, as the
spectacle of vice shocks others. I recollect meeting
with a peasant, in one of the Trekschuyts, when
going to join the frigate at Rotterdam, and after
complaining of the waste he formerly saw in the
English Ambassador's kitchen, which he had supplied
with garden stuff, he said he liked it not; it
was not good; it looked profligate, and he had
therefore ceased to supply them, and let them go to
the green-grocers. This seemed to me a purely
Dutch trait of character; but from one of that
truth-loving nation I could well believe it, for no
people have less hypocrisy, or pretence, or cant of
any sort, than the worthy Hollanders. Their piety
is of a like kind, being very sincere, and quite free
from enthusiasm. They are, however, universally a
religious people; they look to the reversion; they
regard the laying up of a store hereafter, as either a
benefit or an indispensable duty, like providing for
their family after their decease. But they will avoid
extravagance in making the one provision as well
as the other; doing the needful,&mdash;no more. In a
word, they think godliness a great gain, and they

<!-- vol 2 page 94 -->

pursue it as they would a profit of three or three-and-a-half
per cent. on their capital; nor will they
run after any fanatical teacher who would show
them new and more advantageous roads to salvation,
any more than they would run after a projector
who should tempt them with a prospect of
making five or six per cent, or some other impossible
profit.</p>

<p>"In their domestic virtues they are unimpeachable;
showing perfect propriety and purity of conduct,
though without any exuberant warmth of attachment.
A Dutch lover seems almost a contradiction
in terms; it presents to the mind a grotesque
image. I saw a love-letter which my employer's
son, a youth of twenty-four, wrote and asked me to
correct. His mistress's 'last favour' had reached
him 'in due course;' he 'noted the contents;' he took
as much interest in her affairs, as she did in his; he
wished the 'balance might not be on the wrong side
of the account;' and he hoped her guardian would
agree to let 'them join their stocks together for their
mutual benefit.' I observed that he took this composition,
after I had made him add a few tender lines,
to his father, who gave him much praise for it; but
desired him to strike out the addition, which, he

<!-- vol 2 page 95 -->

said, he must have taken from some book, or some
newspaper, and which, he observed, made nonsense
of the whole; besides not being very easily understood.
So the letter, after being carefully copied,
and the copy posted among his correspondence, was
despatched in its original and sensible form.</p>

<p>"The peace and decorum of their household is a
prime consideration with the Dutch; and as I have
known families that were never suffered to have a
poem within their reach, so I believe a novel is
rarely to be found in the hands of any. The seeing
a single play in a year suffices to most for their
measure of theatrical amusement; but concerts are
more freely indulged in, for the Hollander has a
great love of music, and does not regard indulging
it as attended with any danger.</p>

<p>"They are strict economists of every thing, of
time as well as of money. You shall see wealthy
families, which give but two entertainments in a
year, and these, no doubt, on the scale of the
miser's feast, for nothing is spared. It is undeniable
that, in many fine houses, the great hall door is
only opened on occasion of a marriage or a funeral;
the gravel walk that leads to it being made of glazed
gravel, like cut pebbles, and kept free from weeds

<!-- vol 2 page 96 -->

or dust as carefully as a polished table in a drawing-room.
Their luxuries savour equally of traffic
and abstinence. Your busy merchant will retire
once a-week to take the Sabbath rest; but he spends
not his hours in either walking, which he is unaccustomed
to, and not clever at performing, or reading,
of which he has no idea beyond the letters of his
correspondents, the price-current, and, perhaps, the
weekly Brussels Gazette. He sits in his summer
or pleasure-house (<i>loost-haus</i>), and either smokes
his pipe on the borders of the canal, or fishes for
minnow or dace with, perhaps, a stick and strings,
or a crooked pin. But his pipe is his chief enjoyment,
whether in town, or what he calls country,
which is only a few hundred yards from the town.
In some things, however, he will take an extraordinary
interest; they seem to savour of commerce,
or at least of fisheries. The first cargo of herrings
that arrives, he will pay ten or twelve florins a-piece
for, that he may eat this salt relish on the earliest
day. The next day, a dozen or more may be
bought for a florin. Flowers sometimes have been
an object of enjoyment, and have once given rise to
a kind of disease in the country. Fond of gardening,
and excelling in the culture of tulips, as well as

<!-- vol 2 page 97 -->

garden stuff and some fruits, they gave the most extravagant
prices for rare samples of that fine flower,
the perfection of the gardening art; and one rich
burgomaster was known to pay five hundred louis
for a singular specimen which, the moment he
possessed it, he crushed to pieces, that none other
might enjoy the sight for which he alone had paid
so dear. In this, as in other instances which I
cited when speaking of the Germans, we plainly
see the excesses to which any passion will carry
men when indulged contrary to their nature. I
have noted more than once their business-like
habits, their exclusive devotion to mercantile affairs.
A banker, or rather a bill-discounter, a brother-in-law
of my employer, had made a large fortune
in business; and I remember, on seeing his fine
house richly furnished, asking him if he had never
thought of fitting up a room for a library. 'Why
should I do so?' said he; 'I read none, nor does
any one who comes to see me. We have no time
for books.' 'But on such a day as this,' I asked,
'when you don't go to your country house?' It was
Sunday. 'Oh,' said he, 'I shall, after church,
spend it in reading, sure enough; and these are my
books,'&mdash;said he, showing me a glass case, in which

<!-- vol 2 page 98 -->

were many small oblong bundles. He took out one,
and I found it was a parcel of bills of exchange; he
had brought it home with him for the enjoyment of
his holiday, and he told me he would sit half-an-hour
at a time, poring over the names on the back
of a bill, weighing their solvency, and considering
the risk he ran by discounting. 'Believe me,' said
he, 'there is no romance, not even any newspaper,
affords such pleasant reading as this.'</p>

<p>"The people I now found on board the Charlestown
were as different as possible from those I had left;
nor did I begin well to know them, though immediately
aware of this diversity, till after I had long
associated with them both on shipboard and on shore
in their own country. The most striking characteristic
of the good Dutch, their modesty amounting to
humbleness of spirit, I from the first found wanting
to my new companions in an extraordinary degree.
Not that the Hollander is at all deficient in self-possession;
on the contrary, his is a great firmness of
purpose,&mdash;a cool, collected courage, especially in the
form of resolute fortitude, but also rising into contempt
of danger,&mdash;a perseverance amounting to obstinacy,
though also proceeding from fixed and unshaken
determination. I do not at all deny that I

<!-- vol 2 page 99 -->

found these great qualities also in the crew of the
American; but they were not relieved by the Dutchman's
tranquillity, and were certainly not adorned
with his modesty.</p>

<p>"In a few hours after we had set sail, signals
were made by the Admiral Zoutman for an enemy
being in sight; soon these were followed by the
signal to prepare for action; and our vessel immediately
presented a spectacle to me as new as it was
striking. The men who had been most noisy an
hour before, were become silent, thoughtful, exceedingly
intent on their several duties, and all as active,
though in perfect quiet, as bees in a hive, which they
seemed to resemble most of anything I could call
to mind. There was no confusion, no hurry, no
jostling of one against another, great mutual good-will,
much readiness to help one the other, and
above all perfect obedience of every one to his immediate
superior. The ship presented a change as
great nearly as her crew had undergone; and the
change was far from being an improvement. All
the bulkheads of every kind were knocked away;
this being the affair of a moment, we at once saw
from stem to stern clear between decks; and in
another minute all the decks and every part of her

<!-- vol 2 page 100 -->

was flooded with water, that no risk of fire might
remain which could by any possibility be avoided.
The men were soon heated with their work, and were
then stripped to the middle, and indeed without any
clothes but their trowsers. The vessel now presented
a sight to the eye as cold and uncomfortable
as could well be figured; and the chill was not
diminished by the prospect of the scene in which we
were presently to be engaged. A distant firing was
soon heard, which showed that the action was commenced
with one of the Dutch men of war. The
captain's glass told him that it was only a repeating
frigate stationed to windward; but the battle was
now inevitable, and we were nearly ready for it. A
single glass of grog (a mixture of spirits and water)
was now served out to each seaman and each marine,
for we had a quarter company of these also on
board, chiefly occupying our tops. After this, orders
were given to lock the cellar; and it was proclaimed
that whatever seaman having secreted any liquor
should presume to taste a drop till nightfall, should
instantly be shot dead. Three cheers were given on
this order being proclaimed by the boatswain; and
the first lieutenant then directed the powder magazine
to be unlocked and the communication to be

<!-- vol 2 page 101 -->

made with the decks. A wet sheet was then hoisted
going round the whole of the way which joined the
storehouse of destruction with its engines above; and
all being thus prepared for the fight we waited
calmly and silently for its commencement.</p>

<p>"The captain paced the quarter-deck, and spoke
not a word. He constantly applied his glass to his
eye, received reports from his signal lieutenant, and
gave his orders in consequence. Once only he took
me aside and asked if I had ever been in action.
I said I had never even seen the sea till a few days
ago, never had slept on board a ship till the night
before last, had been sick the whole of the day before
and that morning, and had only got well on the
signal being given to clear away for action. 'Aye,'
said he, 'that is a common case. Some men, even
seamen, are never without sickness except in action
or in shipwreck, and so hateful is the disease to
landsmen, that I have heard them say they cared
not, while it lasted, how soon they went down or were
shot.' I ventured to ask if he had good hopes of
the result. 'Why, look ye, young gentleman,' was
his reply, 'this same bank where we be is the
Dogger bank by name; some hundred years agone
it was here the Englanders and Hollanders fought

<!-- vol 2 page 102 -->

many severe actions with equal or varying success,
twice almost beating, twice almost beaten; so I
guess we shall this very day of all be having a
stiffish thing of it, and you landsmen who are not
accustomed to be killed aboard ship may wish night
was come and all well.'</p>

<p>"I confess that in the novelty of my present situation
I did not derive any great comfort from this remark.
It seemed, indeed, to me, that I had needlessly
and not very wisely got into a position I had no business
whatever to be in; exposed to all the risks of war
without being of the military profession. However,
I had taken employment on board a frigate, engaged
on the same side of the contest with my own country,
and it seemed incident to this service that I should
occasionally be exposed to other dangers than those
of the sea. The great increase of the firing soon
put an end to all reflections except those suggested
by the business of the hour; the cannonade had become
general along half the line, and we soon perceived
an English sixty-four (the Bienfaisant, once
a French ship) bearing down towards us, after giving
a broadside to two or three of the Dutch as she
passed. Our vessel, though called a frigate, carried
such weight of metal (thirty-six forty-two pounders

<!-- vol 2 page 103 -->

on one of her decks), that she was quite a match for
the Englishman. Our captain ordered the guns to be
all manned, with matches lighted, and not one to be
fired until we were within pistol-shot; then aim to
be taken at the hull rather than the rigging; for,
unlike the French, who fire at the sails in the hope
of rendering the enemy's ships unmanageable, he
thought his heavy metal well adapted to overpower
his adversary by a concentrated fire.</p>

<p>"The pause that succeeded this order was sufficiently
awful; it indicated a general consciousness
that we were to be fired at by the Englishman
and not to return his fire for a while; the bravest
among us held his breath, in momentary expectation
of the enemy's batteries opening upon us.
They opened soon enough. We received the
broadside of the sixty-four; it mowed down several
of our men and dismounted two of our guns.
In less than five minutes from this we returned
it with tremendous effect. The enemy seemed to
shake and waver, and for some minutes he ceased
to fire; but then came a loud cheer from his decks,
and his fire was more fierce than before. I was
called upon deck at this moment by the captain;
two of his messenger-men having been killed by the

<!-- vol 2 page 104 -->

first broadside, he wanted me to be useful in carrying
orders fore and aft, observing that there was 'no
pen and ink work wanted now, and I might help to
write a little with gunpowder blacking, or, if I preferred
it, with red ink for a change.' I was much
struck, as much as I could be with any thing, to see
how cool and collected he was, and how calmly and
in how few words he gave his orders. His men on
their part were all quiet, all obedience, all activity.
Not one could be seen but whose whole limbs were
in motion. 'There he goes,' said the first lieutenant,
as I passed the mainmast; 'dost know, my fine
fellow, how we seamen calls that there spot by the
mainmast?' I confessed my ignorance; 'Then,' said
he, 'we name it Hell, because it is so hot in action.'
I presently saw reason to assent to the appellation.
A dreadful hail of shot came pelting on us in that
quarter, and laid some men dead at their guns.
Three loud cheers and a dreadful broadside from
our vessel was the answer given to this massacre.
I had now a minute or two to look about me from
the poop, and turning my eye to the rest of the line,
I could see nothing but smoke and flashes in every
direction, so that we could with difficulty discover
the admiral's signals. That, however, was of little

<!-- vol 2 page 105 -->

moment; for, as the captain observed, in a battle
there was but one thing to be done, and that was;
to fight on. Some cheers, however, were from time
to time heard when the wind blew that way, and
we made a point of returning these, in defiance if
hostile, in accord if friendly. About the same time
I was myself struck with a splinter so severely that
it stunned me, and I was carried below. I recollect
the blow, and that my last thought, for I supposed
I was killed, was to think of my mother's grief; I
thought not even of Louise Orange.</p>

<p>"When laid on a plank in the cockpit, I recovered,
and saw the most ghastly sights that the
mind of man can conceive. It was far worse than
the blood, sometimes the brains, which I had seen
profusely scattered on the deck. The cannon-shot
carrying off a man's hand, a chain shot cutting him
in two, a shower of grape falling on his head and
destroying him at once, obliterating every vestige of
his features, seemed to me, though shocking enough,
yet nothing compared to what I now witnessed below;
for those were only bodily, physical horrors
in which the mind seemed not to share: the victim
was instantly dead. But in the cockpit, I saw
the wounded writhing in agony, some with the joints

<!-- vol 2 page 106 -->

of their knees or elbows crushed by a musket or
grape shot&mdash;some with their spine wounded and their
limbs paralysed in consequence&mdash;some with their
eyes knocked out, and bemoaning their hopeless
darkness&mdash;some, worst of all, with mortal wounds
of which they were dying swiftly, but with their
countenances expressive of only agony, whether torture
or terror&mdash;and once I saw what haunted me
for weeks, the eye of a man half dead one instant,
dead the next, yet glaring, haggard and fearful, as
if he took a last, and terrified, and horrid look of
the world.</p>

<p>"When I laid myself down in my berth, and in
the silence of the night, penetrated with the contrast
of the present stillness to the dreadful turmoil of
the day, had offered up my thanks for the mercy
which had preserved me; the visions of that horrid
cockpit were perpetually before my eyes. 'Gracious
God of Heaven!' said I, 'and is it possible
that men should exert the powers thou hast endowed
them withal to convert the fair earth in
which they are placed into a dwelling of savage
fiends, letting every fierce and hateful passion of
their nature rage uncontrolled, and taxing their
faculties to invent for one another the most exquisite

<!-- vol 2 page 107 -->

torments the human frame can endure? Of
all crimes surely this of war is the greatest; and it
comprises within itself every form of human suffering
produced by human guilt.'</p>

<p>"The battle had lasted between three and four
hours; neither side could boast a complete victory;
for though one Dutch line-of-battle ship, the Hollander,
was so disabled, that she went down the
night of the engagement, leaving the crew barely
time to save their lives, but not to carry out the
wounded, and though two others were pronounced
incapable of further service, the English had suffered
severely, almost all their ships having been so
wounded in the rigging and masts, that they were
unable to chase and capture even the disabled Dutch
vessels. The Charlestown was so severely handled
in battle, that she was not expected to keep the sea,
and as it was for some time believed she had gone
down, we were congratulated on our safety when we
reached the Texel the day after. There were said to
be eleven hundred killed and wounded, of the former
not half so many as of the latter, though one vessel
alone, the Admiral's, lost near a hundred men.
They cited a remarkable trait, on board the enemy,
of a boy's courage, son of a captain killed in the

<!-- vol 2 page 108 -->

action, and who was alone close by his father's side
at the time. He was but ten years old, and behaved
through the fight with the greatest coolness
and courage. The English King and Prince received
Admiral Parker at dinner in the Royal
Yacht, and afterwards went to visit his ship, where
this boy was presented to him, and was promised a
suitable provision in honour of his father's memory.
'Sire,' said the brave Admiral, 'your Majesty will
excuse me; I have already adopted him as my
son.'</p>

<p>"A portion of my story," added the Solitary,
"remains to be told, but the day wanes, and I am
fatigued. When next you come to this Hermitage
you shall hear the conclusion of these sad adventures."</p>

<p>The Count returned to the Ch&acirc;teau, and his
mind was deeply impressed with the sample which
he had just had of "the pride, pomp and circumstance
of glorious war," and the effects which a near
view of it is calculated to produce upon the mind of
a rational being not trained to its ways. Nor could
he help reflecting on the strange caprice of men
which in all ages has led them with a singular unanimity
to reserve for those who most successfully

<!-- vol 2 page 109 -->

practise this art, the title of Great, thus holding out
to every one who rules their destinies the strongest,
inducements to betray the high trust committed to
his hands, avoid the blessed paths of peace, and
cover the fair surface of the earth with rapine and
with slaughter.</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="small">THE ADVANCE OF CHANGE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> his arrival, he found the Baron had returned
from Lyons during his absence, bringing with him
a friend, whom he had met there, and craved permission
of the Marquess to introduce: this was M.
La Croasse, one of the most distinguished men of the
day, or rather of the day before, he having served
in a high station, during M. Sartine's short naval
administration; but he had now retired from active
life, and passed his time in literary ease, though
still an acute and anxious observer of public events.
He was described by the Baron, who intimately
knew and greatly esteemed him (albeit not a person
prone either to confidence or admiration), as a man
of extraordinary talents, great information, and an
active mind; a fearless asserter of his principles,
which were extremely different from his friend's in
some particulars, and one who to further those principles

<!-- vol 2 page 111 -->

was capable of making great sacrifices. He
had in early life belonged to the robe or bar, and
had attained a high rank in the debates of the Parliament;
but this position he gave up to join Sartine's
administration, and he retired with him from office.
His writings were of very high merit, and although
his pen had been variously employed, it was never
so active as in the defence of the established institutions
of the State. Of these he was a warm supporter,
as well of the Church established, as of
the King anointed; and to both he rendered strenuous,
able, effectual service, whether in office or
in retirement. Like all men of great talents and
success in life, he had, the Baron observed, his enemies,
who pelted him incessantly, sometimes with
paper pellets in the daily press, sometimes with
the leaden pellets of their books; to which M. La
Croasse seemed, he said, sufficiently indifferent, for
indeed he had himself, while in active life, been
a pretty free dealer in political gymnastics, as
the Baron termed such personalities. Emmeline,
who esteemed him highly too, added that the
new Lion (as she merrily called him) would
have his share in the conversation; but as he was
of perfectly good breeding, she said, and could

<!-- vol 2 page 112 -->

listen as well as talk, this never offended, the
rather as he was always sure to contribute something
valuable either in wit, in argument, or in
narrative.</p>

<p>When the Baron arrived, his first object of course
had been to meet his niece, whom, to his great joy,
he found in as good health as she ever was used
to enjoy. His next care was to see the Countess,
whom he had left in a state of more than half regret
at the confession unwarily wrung from her, of
a passion too strong to be controlled or concealed.
Her letter, the only one she wrote to him, had been
cold and formal in a degree that alarmed him, and
he had answered in the way he deemed best calculated
to reassure her, and quiet the alarm her
awakened pride seemed to have sounded. There
was in his letter a careful avoiding of anything like
gladness or even satisfaction: the all but unruly
joy that filled his bosom, he kept in a state of close
compression; and he trembled as he approached
an interview which must decide his fate. Chance
would have it that they met alone in the library,
M. La Croasse having retired to dress, after
being presented to the family in the saloon. The
Countess could not resist the impulse to run up and

<!-- vol 2 page 113 -->

testify her sincere happiness at again seeing her
friend; she suffered him to cover her beautiful hand
with ardent kisses, and gently whispered in his ear
how slowly the hours of his absence had passed.
He felt now satisfied, and all but secure; nothing
sinister had happened; no false step had been made
by him; no untoward resolution formed by her;
no interference of any unfriendly friend had been
attempted; and time and patience, and extreme
care and indefatigable attention, he trusted would
do the rest. In this frame of mind, after a little
while they both met the company at dinner, and for
the first time he avoided either sitting by her, or
giving her his arm from the drawing-room, when it
was announced that they "were served."</p>

<p>No day now passed without some event being
reported at the Ch&acirc;teau; and though busy rumour
often exaggerated and not seldom created, there was
yet quite enough of reality painfully to awaken the
attention of the most indifferent, and to fix in anxious
forebodings the thoughts of the most careless. The
ferment had spread from Dauphin&eacute; into Provence,
and there were indications of Languedoc being
affected. The violence which raged in Dauphin&eacute;
seemed now certain. There was no longer any

<!-- vol 2 page 114 -->

doubt that the decree lately talked of against <i>lettres
de cachet</i> had been formally passed by the Parliament
of Grenoble; and to denounce the penalty of
death against persons for executing a royal command,
formally signified by the ministers of the
crown, seemed a proceeding so extreme as was wholly
inconsistent with the allegiance of the body to its
sovereign. Men wondered at the pause which followed,
and waited in suspense to see what course the
government would pursue in circumstances equally
novel and alarming.</p>

<p>"This event," said the Marquess as soon as dinner
being over, the company were assembled in the
salon, "this event appears, too, beyond a doubt, to
have happened, and it certainly demands all the
attention of the ministers."</p>

<p>"Aye, and all their vigour," the Baron answered.
"Can any one doubt that the very monarchy may
be shaken to its foundations by such acts going
unopposed, and unpunished?"</p>

<p>"But, Baron," the Marquess said, "I have often
heard you contend against the abuse at least, of that
terrible power by which a minister can shut up his
political adversary, or even his rival in private life,
as if he were a traitor to the state."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 115 -->

<p>"Not only against the abuse of this power, this
detestable power, have you heard me contend," replied
the Baron, "but against its use altogether, as
utterly incompatible with even the semblance of
freedom, and as placing our European monarchies
on a footing with the despotisms of the East. I
would have it entirely abrogated; but then I dread
seeing even a great good attained by violent and
lawless means. Let the States General, which must
now sooner or later be assembled, effect this salutary
reform in our system, with such other improvements
as can safely be made; but do not let a provincial
assembly set itself up against that which still is the
law of the land, and hang men for executing the
process of that law."</p>

<p>"But, indeed," said M. La Croasse, who had lately
been in the capital, "the Grenoble decree seems not
more violent than that of the Parliament of Paris, a
few weeks ago, threatening with the galleys whoever
should collect the new stamp-tax, just registered by
the king's command in a bed of justice."</p>

<p>"I must really observe," the Baron said, "that
there is this broad distinction between the two cases.
The parliament of the capital had refused to register
the edict, and the force applied to compel the

<!-- vol 2 page 116 -->

registration was deemed by them unlawful&mdash;unconstitutional
it certainly was;&mdash;whereas the provincial
parliament flies in the face of the known and admitted
law. Besides, you forget that the Parliament
of Paris has been banished to Troyes in consequence
of its resistance. No, let both parliaments wait till
that convocation of the States General, for which the
metropolitan body has nobly and disinterestedly
petitioned by a great majority; and that assembly of
our ancient representatives will see right and justice
done."</p>

<p>"Why," asked the Countess, "should you say
those States General are so sure to be assembled?
It is but the other day that the Notables were
summoned to meet for the second time in order to
consider our financial difficulties, and they will probably
make salutary conditions with the Crown when
they grant the relief which their last meeting did
not accede to."</p>

<p>"No doubt, Countess, they are about to meet,
and in May we shall again see that assembly. But
it is a half-measure, at the most a half-measure;
I give it a large allowance when I so call it; and,
believe me, we are no longer in that state when any
thing short of whole measures, and vigorous ones too,

<!-- vol 2 page 117 -->

will do. Why, the Notables are a set of men, not
exceeding one hundred and forty-four in number,
princes, peers, marshals, prelates, magistrates&mdash;every
body but deputies of the people, of whom there are
but twelve,&mdash;and all named by the Crown. This
surely is any thing rather than a popular representation,
or indeed a representation at all."</p>

<p>"Ah, my clear Baron," interrupted M. La Croasse,
"rather let us question whether it was necessary, and
if not necessary surely it could not be right, to have
even the Notables, such as you justly describe them,
assembled at all. In our monarchy, depend upon it,
whenever a public body is once assembled for debate,
gather them together how you will, a power will be
created repugnant to the genius of our institutions;
and the government, the government of a single person,
will be gotten into a false position. You may
say, either go farther, or go not so far. I don't
much quarrel with your dilemma, but I firmly say&mdash;not
so far."</p>

<p>"But, Baron," said the Countess, resuming the
place in the conversation from which she had been
removed, "what course would you now have the
Court take? The banishment to Troyes, you see,
has not produced any effect. The parliament is

<!-- vol 2 page 118 -->

more popular than ever, and the magnificent remonstrance
which it has presented seems to me
equally admirable for the talents and for the wisdom
which it shows."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear lady," he answered, "I have
little fear of our Dauphin&eacute; gentry raising themselves
by any such efforts, should the same course be taken
with them. And were I the Archbishop of Toulouse,
I should signalize my undisputed succession to M.
de Calonne as minister, by such an act of vigour as
should at once show the Grenoble assembly that the
law must be reformed by the law and not broken
by the authorities of the country. But I doubt his
firmness, and I cannot forget that he took office
after opposing the truly patriotic plan of M. de
Calonne, a wise scheme of Turgot, aiding in the vile
factious clamour which drove that great minister into
exile for nobly attempting to do his duty, and make
all imposts fall upon all ranks."</p>

<p>"Of a truth," here interposed the Abb&eacute;, "I do
prefer, as is natural and fit in me a churchman, the
rule of the most reverend prelate, to that of the man
who wished to lay a sacrilegious hand on the goods of
the Holy Church. For the first time was there heard,
and pray we it may even be for the last, a mention

<!-- vol 2 page 119 -->

made of bringing these sacred possessions within the
pale of profane, worldly, fleshly, taxation."</p>

<p>The Baron turned not aside from his argument
to take any notice of this pious ejaculation, but went
on to discuss with the Marquess and the Countess
the prospects of the country; and he dwelt with
peculiar earnestness upon the risk which the state
ran, and above all the cause of sound reform, by
such violence as had characterised the Grenoble
proceedings, followed by the popular outbreak there
and in other quarters. "I really can hardly describe,"
he said, "how this alarms me. I had long been
cherishing the hope that the great diffusion of knowledge,
which has in late years taken place among
our people of the upper and even middle classes;
the example of America, and the intercourse of our
army with the republicans; the resort of so many
of our nobles to England, and their consequent admiration
of free institutions, would, combined with
the financial difficulties of the government (for out
of evil comes good), have produced some general
measures of sound practical improvement in our
constitution. But all my hopes must be dashed to
the ground, if any illegal acts interpose their baneful
influence; for once let loose the lawless spirit of

<!-- vol 2 page 120 -->

revolt, once call in the mere multitude, without
property, without information, without any wise or
moderate spirit to temper their proceedings; once, in
short, extend over the country such a popular ferment
as we have lately heard at Grenoble immediately
succeeded the ill-starred decree of the parliament,
and I see but one probable result: all wise
and good men will be justly alarmed at the prospect
of worse mischiefs from revolution than any we
now suffer under from established abuses, and the
perpetuation of those abuses in future will be the
consequence, beside risking all the evils of anarchy
at the present time."</p>

<p>"I do so entirely agree with you," said the
Marquess, "that I shall be most anxious till I see
the government shows the vigour which can alone fit
it to grapple with the occasion. I am not, like you,
a reformer at all. My wish is to sit under the quiet
shade of the constitution which protected our forefathers;
and though dissenting conscientiously from
the Established Church, I am not one of those who
would see it overthrown, and the State, which leans
upon it, thereby shaken."</p>

<p>"Marquess! Marquess!" said the very reverend
the Abb&eacute;, "there did speak through you, not only the

<!-- vol 2 page 121 -->

spirit of your maternal grandfather, a pillar of our
Zion, but the spirit of the Holy Church herself.
Verily, were all the Reformed like unto you, I should
the less earnestly beseech the Blessed Virgin to reinforce
and restore to its vigour the godly edict
whereby Louis XIV., acting under her warning and
the inspiration of the Saints, did root out that disgrace
of our country, the Ordinance of Nantes."</p>

<p>"Aye, Abb&eacute;," said Ernest, "and also acting
under certain female influence. Pray do be pleased
to tell us which of all the Saints was it, that by a
special miracle took the likeness of a kept-mistress,
and, having first secured the king's devotion, then
incited him to persecute the pious Protestants for
the glory of God?"</p>

<p>"Truly it little becomes weak and erring mortals,"
rejoined the man of many masses, "to watch
closely the instruments whereby the inscrutable wisdom
doth compass its holy ends. An ass hath heretofore
once been made the minister of heaven."</p>

<p>"Nor mayhap for the last time," quoth the
Chevalier, leering archly at the reverend father.
"Howbeit," added he, "I will not have too much
blame cast on that lady, or on the sisterhood she
belongs to. Many of them have I known in my day&mdash;more,

<!-- vol 2 page 122 -->

good lack, than I now know&mdash;and I will
aver that there be worse women abroad in the
world."</p>

<p>"Why, truly, brother," the good Marchioness
said, "I grieve to hear you thus undertaking the
defence of sin. Have you so little regard to female
virtue as that comes to?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, sweet sister, on the very contrary,
dear heart! Chastity of life do I respect
mainly in others, as I strive to maintain it in my
own proper person."</p>

<p>"Aye, truly!" said the Marquess; "and your
words are chosen with a curious accuracy; for I
dare swear you respect it in others pretty exactly
in the same proportion in which you maintain it
in yourself."</p>

<p>"Well, well! I quarrel not with any man about
an adverb, hardly for a noun-substantive&mdash;save once
knocking a sailor down in Toulon harbour for
calling me a land-lubber, after I had been suffering
a fortnight in that prison of his, sometimes an hospital
too, and always with risk of drowning to boot.
But I won't be baulked of my fancy for the character
of that kind of woman, and I will maintain
anywhere you please, that I have known more kind

<!-- vol 2 page 123 -->

hearts, less malice, and more honesty among them
than you shall easily find in any of your Paris
drawing-rooms among your finest ladies."</p>

<p>"Why, brother," said the Marquess, "do you
really mean to reverse the name of honest woman, and
not only give it but confine it to your girl (<i>fille</i>)?"</p>

<p>"Not quite so," answered the merry knight,
"but I only would say that with that caste, with
those I may call <i>professors</i>, I have seldom found
such glibness of lying as with your amateurs; and
that you shall meet with more malice and uncharitableness
in a brace of prudes of the Faubourg,
than in a whole nunnery of the Rue Taitbout."</p>

<p>Though the season was far advanced towards
Christmas, the delightful climate of Languedoc
kept together the party at the Ch&acirc;teau; and, indeed,
now that an intimate friendship had been
formed among them by so many weeks' residence
in the same house, they were well disposed to converse
together on the sum of affairs, the sagacity
and information of the Baron, joined to the good
sense of Chatillon, the quickness and sagacity
of the Countess, and the gay and worldly spirits
of Ernest, affording ample means of discussing the
interesting matters which each day's intelligence

<!-- vol 2 page 124 -->

suggested, while the calm spirit of the Marquess, and
the religious habits of his amiable wife, tempered the
more lively, not to say impetuous spirit in which some
others were disposed to handle political questions.</p>

<p>As the season drew to a close, Madame de Bagnolles
ventured to have an apartment fitted up for
Albert in a remote corner of the Ch&acirc;teau, believed
by the servants to be haunted, and carefully shunned
accordingly; an apartment to which herself and
Chatillon alone had access. But it is needless to
add that the Solitary never could form a part of
the family circle, though he watched with the
most lively interest the course which events were
now taking, and which oftentimes formed the subject
of his conversation with both his new friend
and his kind hostess.</p>

<p>Before the end of November the news arrived of
the King having required the registering of two
most important edicts, the one for raising an immense
loan of nearly twenty millions of louis, the
other for granting entire equality of civil rights to
the Protestants. The latter measure was universally
approved; the former excited great opposition;
and though the King had begun the meeting by
allowing freedom of speech, he was so harassed

<!-- vol 2 page 125 -->

by the nine hours' debate and the opposition given
to the plan, that he abruptly, as if he had lost all
patience and temper, commanded the registering of
the edict; and when some of the members, headed
by the Duke of Orleans, protested against this proceeding
as contrary to law, suddenly left the assembly
and issued a <i>lettre de cachet</i> banishing the
Duke to his country house, and sending two magistrates
of the Parliament to different prisons at a
distance from Paris. This intelligence was speedily
followed by the memorable remonstrance of the
parliament, wherein, after agreeing to register the
loan edict to save public credit, they demanded the
immediate liberation of the three members, unless
they should be forthwith brought to trial, and
added that they did not solicit this from the sovereign
as a favour, but required it as an act of mere
justice to which kings are subject like their people;
that his ancestor, Henry IV., avowed his having two
sovereigns, God and the Law; that punishing men
is no part of the King's functions, and that ordering
of his own accord exile and arrest without a trial
is alike contrary to the laws of the realm and the
principles of eternal justice.</p>

<p>"I own," said the Baron, "that in all their proceedings

<!-- vol 2 page 126 -->

upon this remarkable occasion, I can see
no reason to differ with, much less blame, the Parliament
of Paris. But the Court's want of decision,
its alternate vigour beyond the law and timidity
to enforce the law, its hot fit of violence to-day
succeeded by the cold fit of fear to-morrow, presents
one of the most pitiable spectacles ever
exhibited, and unhappily shows what a broken
reed we have to rely upon in the dreadful crisis
which is plainly approaching."</p>

<p>"Baron," said the Marquess, "if our reverend
friend, the Abb&eacute;, would suffer me to say so, I could
wish ecclesiastics, such especially as fill the higher
places in the Church, would confine their attention
to only spiritual concerns, and leave secular men to
manage the affairs of this lower world. Can anything
be conceived more feeble and inefficient than
the Archbishop's administration, unless indeed it be
the conduct of the Count d'Artois and the Court?"</p>

<p>"I entirely agree with you," said the Baron
"but I go a step further: I hold that a man who
obtrudes himself from vanity or from ambition into
a station of difficulty which demands capacity, and
above all firmness, beyond what he possesses, commits
one of the gravest offences against his country.

<!-- vol 2 page 127 -->

We are too apt to pity such men as merely weak,
and not to reprobate them as ill-meaning. A
minister who takes the helm of the state-vessel in
perilous circumstances, and is wanting in the skill
to steer her through, is in my eyes more criminal
than a landsman who risks the lives of a crew by
taking the command of a ship when he is utterly
unable to direct her course."</p>

<p>"Possibly I may agree in this, but I cannot
quite pronounce the same severe censure upon mere
want of nerves, want of vigour, and firmness."</p>

<p>"Then of that I am more certain still," said M.
La Croasse, "than the Baron can be of his other
point. Can anything be more despicable than a
man voluntarily putting himself in a position where
valour is required, and the safety of an army or a
kingdom depends upon his courage, who is not
secure in counting on his nerves, and ruins the
greatest interests by quailing in the hour of trial?
No, no! despicable such a person may be; but
assuredly no object of pity. Justly reprobated as
well as scorned he must be by every rational observer;
nor will his fault, his grievous fault, be
expiated by his fate if he perishes under the ruin
which he has caused."</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 128 -->

<p>"It seems clear to me," said the Marquess, "that
neither of you are in much danger of wanting
subjects of reprobation according to the canons of
political morality which you now lay down. But
I own, though disposed to go along with your reasoning
as to ministers, I cannot quite consent so
severely to blame princes, whose high station is not
of their own seeking, and whose firmness as well as
their capacity are constantly put to the rudest trials,
beside their being really made answerable for all
the errors, crimes, and weaknesses of those who
serve them. Can anything be more unjust than
harshly to visit our present King with the consequences,
first of Calonne's rashness, then of the
Archbishop's incapacity and feebleness, to say
nothing of the Abb&eacute; Terray's alternate violence
and wavering?"</p>

<p>"Why, as to kings, I grant you," said the Baron,
"that, their places not having been of their own
seeking, they are not blameable for their natural
defects. But a most heavy load of responsibility
have they assuredly for the defects and the vices
too common to their station, those of negligence in
administering public affairs, caprice and other personal
motives in the selection of their counsellors, and

<!-- vol 2 page 129 -->

indeed want of firmness either to perform their duty,
or resign the trust which they dare not execute."</p>

<p>"Do but consider, dear Zio," said Emmeline,
"how princes are educated; brought up among
flatterers, pampered by indulgence, excluded from
almost all wholesome intercourse, scarce ever hearing
the truth spoken, but breathing from their birth
upwards an atmosphere of lies! Surely this training,
which seems the most perfectly fitted both to
weaken the judgment and to corrupt the heart,
should make us feel some tolerance for their errors;
nay, compassion for their infirmities. Especially
does it seem to me unjust, that the people who
are the first to spoil princes by adulation should
always be the loudest to complain of the vices and
the follies themselves have engendered in the royal
nature."</p>

<p>"Well argued, well declaimed, Mdlle. Emmeline,"
said the Countess, whose attachment to the
Baron had now made her think both better and
more kindly of his loved charge. "I don't think
the old gentleman can easily answer that."</p>

<p>"Why, indeed," said the Baron, while his eyes
glistened with pride at this praise of his niece, from
the lips he of all others delighted should charm his

<!-- vol 2 page 130 -->

ear with that soft music, "I am very far from wishing
to deny Emmeline's position, especially as to
the gross injustice of the people; the fond mother
that first spoils the child, and then whips it for
being spoilt. But though I will so far take the
royal training into my account, I am yet quite
certain that none but an originally bad nature
could prevent a Sovereign from bestowing due care
upon the discharge of an office so awfully responsible
as his. He can always, if deficient in firmness,
strengthen himself with steady ministers; he can
always, if incapable, give up the management of
affairs to more skilful hands."</p>

<p>"One word more, dear Zio," said Emmeline,
"and I have done. Surely the choice of able servants
is a proof of capacity; and you will find that
weak princes have very seldom been well served;
able ones always."</p>

<p>"I grant you this, dear child," said the Baron;
"but I am only complaining of great deficiencies in
great emergencies; and I really cannot doubt that
when a man of a somewhat feeble capacity, and certainly
as ill educated as may be, feels a crisis approaching,
he must, by the mere instinct of fear, be
warned that this is no time for him to govern, or let

<!-- vol 2 page 131 -->

his wife and family govern. The storm is raging,
and the breakers are nigh; he must have the sense
to see his danger, unless he be an idiot, and then his
grandees should set him aside, if his Councils or
his Parliaments cannot; and, seeing his danger,
he can inform himself as to other men's ability,
by making pretty general enquiries, if he won't
listen to the public voice, and may be thus led to
give up the helm into some one's hands strong
enough to hold it."</p>

<p>"It is certain," said the Marquess, "that we do
pay a price of some amount for the inestimable
advantage of a regular and fixed order of succession,
which hereditary monarchy secures. A tyrant, a
dunce, a profligate, an idiot, an infant, may at any
time be called to exercise the most important of human
trusts, for the good or for the evil of millions.
Nevertheless, the tranquillity thus purchased is
well worth the price. God grant we may not be
approaching the time when we are to experience how
costly this blessing is! As yet, however, I for one
am little disposed to cast blame on the King's
conduct."</p>

<p>"I must differ widely with you there," the Baron
replied. "The King's conduct has been a model

<!-- vol 2 page 132 -->

of imbecility in all its forms, almost in all its degrees,
even if we acquit him of falsehood and other
bad motives, which I own I find it hard to do. He
was educated in profound admiration of his father,
the Dauphin, who is known to have made the good
Duke of Burgundy his model, a prince understood
to have determined upon reviving the States General.
Yet can anything be more shuffling and fickle, not
to say insincere, than his Majesty's whole conduct
now is respecting the convocation of that body?
Then he takes M. de Brienne to his councils as
prime minister, a trust very rarely given at all, and
takes him merely because he had succeeded by the
clamour of interested bodies against Calonne and
the public good&mdash;a clamour raised on account of the
very measures of finance which the King himself
most approved. Next comes the refusal to register
the stamp-tax, and now we have a little vigour at
last; the Parliament is banished to Troyes. The
discontent of the Parisians was immediately heard,
and the King at once gave up his tax and restored
the Parliament. The cold fit passed away; the hot
fit followed; and the King in a pet, really like a
spoilt child, quarrels with the Parliament for debating
the proposition he had desired it to discuss,

<!-- vol 2 page 133 -->

and imprisons three of its members. The fruit which
he reaps from the whirlwind thus sowed by his incapable
hand, is the tempest of which we have just
heard the first roaring in the all but revolutionary
remonstrance that arrived to-day."</p>

<p>It might be thought that the Lady Countess
had now enjoyed a political talk to her very heart's
content; for she had been discussing both with the
Marquess, the Baron, and a retired statesman, formerly
much, still considerably mixed up in public
affairs, and whose intimacy was close with the leading
politicians of the day. But since her attachment
for the Baron, it appeared as if politics formed
less than before a portion of her nature, probably
because it is always difficult for the female mind
to be moved by two strong propensities at one
time. She still took an interest, and even a
warm interest, in the subject; but it was when
she could combine this with the more lively interest
which she took in her friend's society; and
she soon grew tired of discussions in which others
mingled. With him she could walk or sit for
hours conversing, and politics in their discussions
she referred to all subjects except perhaps that
which he preferred to all, his love for her, which

<!-- vol 2 page 134 -->

each hour that flew over his head only served to
make more engrossing and more fervent.</p>

<p>The debates of the company at large thus affording
her less pleasure than formerly, she was rather
amused than tired with the humours of the good old
knight and the fantastical chat of his son. The
latter had indeed a very sufficient sense of the ludicrous,
and he gratified it freely in the neighbourhood.
The good folks at Nismes thus furnished
daily food for his mirth, not seldom of a somewhat
pungent quality. All subjects came alike to him;
all were welcome. The combined and contrasted
vulgarity and conceit of provincial manners was
never lost upon this Paris observer. But he soared
above such obvious game, and would catch the peculiarities
of the church and the sects; of the old
trader and the young beau with local rank; of the
maiden prude, and the widowed expectant; of the
prudent mother looking out for a son-in-law, and
the wary sire seeking to endow his damsel cost-free
to himself. In this last department he had
found some amusement from old M. Faucon, and
amused the Countess and the Baron with his
judicious and persevering examination into the
affairs of a young friend of Ernest, who had lately

<!-- vol 2 page 135 -->

come from Paris, and proposed to marry Mdlle.
Faucon, his youngest daughter. "Well now, my
good friend," said the old gentleman, "what sort
of a man, what class of man, should you say he
is?"&mdash;"Oh," replied Ernest, "excellent; no better
man in the world."&mdash;"Very good, very good,"
said the senior, "but how is he in respect of outward
and visible signs?"&mdash;"Not a finer looking
fellow in all Paris," answered his wicked friend.&mdash;"Good,
good, good again! But let us see whereabout
is he? How may his father be, or so?"&mdash;"One
of the best families in Auvergne; I should
say one of the very best."&mdash;"Excellent, excellent,
nothing can be better&mdash;nothing possibly&mdash;but his
condition, as it were&mdash;how should you place him?"&mdash;"Why,
as a most high-bred, well-born cavalier,
who would be the honour and ornament of any
family he came into."&mdash;"Aye, there it is&mdash;there it
is&mdash;just exactly so&mdash;good! good!&mdash;But now&mdash;what
should you say&mdash;whereabouts is he as to what
may be called, as it might be, as a body may
say, his property?"&mdash;"Oh," said Ernest, as if he
now first saw the drift of the old Faucon's interrogatory&mdash;"Oh,
as to that, his father has at the
least eight thousand louis a-year in land in Auvergne,

<!-- vol 2 page 136 -->

besides an excellent house in the Faubourg St. Germain,
and Adolphe is the only child."&mdash;"Well!
well! that you know is neither here nor there," said
M. Faucon, calmly. "But, nevertheless, my good
friend, as you say the young man is very worthy,
and very honourable, and of a good family, and
much esteemed by yourself, which I reckon a great
recommendation, why then I consider that it will
be a suitable match, and I for one feel disposed
to give my consent."</p>

<p>By such little scenes as these, which he brought
daily home from Nismes, occasionally with the help
of the old Chevalier, who joined him in the chase,
and by acting the parts amusingly and accurately
enough, Ernest agreeably diversified the graver discussions
of the Ch&acirc;teau; and even the fastidious
Countess and the more fastidious Baron were fain
to laugh heartily, and much as at first it might cost
them to confess themselves interested.</p>

<p>The Count too would now and then amuse
himself with Ernest; but he preferred stealing away
to the apartment of the Solitary; and a few days
after he had been established in it for the winter
season, Albert thus continued his narrative.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">THE NEW WORLD.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">As</span> soon as we had refitted the frigate after the sea-fight,
we sailed for America, and the weather proved
fine till towards the middle of the month. It was
then September, and the equinoctial gales came on
with more than usual violence. For the first twelve
hours of the storm, the men thought nothing of it,
relying on their favourite maxim, that a well-found
vessel in the open sea has nothing to fear. The
captain, too, somewhat rashly foretold, from certain
infallible signs, that the gale would go down with
the sun, as it had begun at sun-rise. The sailing-master,
an old and experienced navigator, was of a
different opinion, and told the first lieutenant, on
his evening watch, that we had only as yet seen the
beginning of mischief. It came to pass as he said;
for in the course of an hour after dark the gale
increased rapidly, and by midnight it blew a hurricane,

<!-- vol 2 page 138 -->

though we were not in the tropical latitudes.
Never did I conceive beforehand anything like the
waves which literally rose like mountains, with a
deep and dark abyss between them, and a crest of
foam crowning the summits, and seeming to eddy
in light blue flame. The ceaseless noise of the wind
roaring furiously through the cordage, with only
bare poles of masts exposed to its force, all but a
small fore-topsail and a storm-jib above the bowsprit,
gave the mind a lively idea of a destroying power
and of the desolation it was working all around. The
extreme labouring of the ship made it necessary to
throw most of our guns overboard; at length we
had to cut away our main and our mizen masts.
Two hours after midnight the alarm was given that
we had sprung a leak; but our force on board was
such that we expected easily to keep it under. In
this however we were disappointed, for the water
made upon us sensibly. Believing we must by our
reckoning be within two days' sail of the coast, we
now fired signal-guns of distress. But no one answered;
no flash broke the thick darkness of the
night. Meantime the water made more rapidly;
the master reckoned that if we should not be relieved
in two hours we must founder, and none had a

<!-- vol 2 page 139 -->

chance of his life unless the few whom the two boats
could save. The captain had met the whole of the
emergency with the most calm composure, and the
most admirable presence of mind; giving every
proper direction, receiving all advice tendered by
either his officers or the master, weighing the merits
of every suggestion, and finally but firmly deciding
for himself, and more than once trusting his own
judgment, though standing alone in opposition to his
whole staff. The discipline he maintained was perfect.
I remember a man using some insolent expression
 when the precaution was taken of throwing
overboard all the spirit-casks. The captain instantly
felled him to the ground, and, as I thought, had
killed him, with a heavy blow from an iron bar then
in his hand. At this period of the night I perceived
that the same men who had been as bold as lions in
the battle, even while the fire was mowing down their
ranks, and who at the early part of the storm were
almost careless and gay when fully occupied, now
began to sink and lose courage, having no longer
either occupation or hope. However, this could last
but a short while, and I suppose they all shared the
sort of feeling which I had myself, that of sudden
and profound despair for the first half-hour of

<!-- vol 2 page 140 -->

inactive waiting for death, and afterwards a listless
indifference to everything&mdash;a calm passive despair.</p>

<p>"When all exertions were unavailing, and only the
pumps were kept going, the captain gave orders for
prayers. I think I now see him standing reverently
upright, between decks, with his hat slowly taken
off, his brown weather-beaten face, grave, as usually
it was, perhaps a little more pensive than his wont,
and his dark grey locks covering his head except in
front, where it was bald. He slowly and earnestly
read the prayers appointed for the occasion from
a small book which the lamp let him see to use.
They are extremely short, and occupied but a
minute or two. The carpenters having again
sounded and examined the leak, made no more
favourable report; but in half an hour more the
gale slacked, and it seemed to the same men that
the pumps were now keeping the water under, from
which it was conjectured that some of the loose
lumber, some flax or other soft matter, had got
jammed into the leak. This gave the seamen fresh
spirits, and, by redoubled exertions, a favourable
report at length was obtained; the water in the well
had diminished half a foot. This good symptom
continued during the next hour; and we now were

<!-- vol 2 page 141 -->

suddenly raised from the lowest despair to the other
extreme of a hope too sanguine, possibly groundless.
Our thanks to the Great Disposer were heartily
poured forth, and the men were visibly thrown
into gay spirits by the change. The captain alone
retained his perfect and his wonted calmness; he
appeared to feel no kind of elation; he continued
unmoved to give his orders, and maintain the most
exact discipline; and, to do the crew justice, he was
universally respected and implicitly obeyed.</p>

<p>"The day broke with a great mitigation of the
tempest. Before night the weather was moderate.
Fortunately the wind favoured our making the land,
for as the leak had again begun to pour in upon
us, had we not got into Charlestown harbour next
morning there was every reason to believe that we
must have gone to the bottom after all. We did
not see a single vessel, nor did one gun answer our
signals, the hurricane having driven every thing that
was spared into port.</p>

<p>"I landed in the New World, and felt at once the
change perceptible in every direction, whether I
looked at the buildings, or the trees, or the waters,
or the people. The town is finely built; many of
the houses large palaces; not a plant or a flower that

<!-- vol 2 page 142 -->

I had ever before seen. But the thing which most
arrested my attention was the people, a full half of
whom were blacks. The woolly heads, flat noses,
snow-white teeth, and jet black skin of these crowds,
intermixed with some of a like form but a brown hue
in all shades from dark to light, presented a sight
wholly new and unexpected. But I soon found more
to wonder at, not certainly to admire. One of these
negroes was lying in the heat of the day across a stair
which a boy who might be nine years old, wished to
go up. Instead of asking him to rise, the urchin gave
him a severe kick on the face, which made his nose
bleed, and the poor creature, with many humble apologies
for not making way in time, ran off smarting
under the blow. The inn I went to was served, of
course, only by these people, but none of them durst
go to the ship to fetch my box; the fear of their escape
prevented any from being allowed ever to cross the
threshold. During the two or three days that I remained
in Charlestown the air continually resounded
with the lash applied to punish the slaves, and the
mistress of the house was the person who chiefly inflicted
it, sometimes with her own hands, sometimes,
when fatigued, by ordering others to take the whip.
I never remember to have seen more ferocious passions

<!-- vol 2 page 143 -->

painted in the expression of a human countenance
than I saw in that of this woman-fiend.
Though far from ugly she was frightful.</p>

<p>"It happened to me that I saw some people
crowding round a door, and on asking what was
going on in the building, I learnt it was a slave
court. I entered, and found a single justice trying
a slave for some offence against his master's property,
with two or three persons, freeholders or
owners of land, near to assist him. The poor
wretch was condemned to death, and soon after
executed. A French gentleman who stood near me
said that there were no less than seventy offences
capital in a slave, for which a white man could
only be punished by imprisonment or fine; that
no black could give evidence against a white, but
that fellow-slaves could be witnesses against one
another; and that the Trial by Jury, which the
English, both of the Old and the New World,
regard as their most precious right, is not known
in the case of the poor negro. This statement prepared
me to see grievous injustice; but on going
to a white court, one of the leading tribunals of the
place, I found all my previous ideas had fallen
very far short of the truth; for I there saw a master

<!-- vol 2 page 144 -->

tried for having cruelly ordered a slave to be tied
down to a plank, and another negro to saw off his
head, and then fling the blood-streaming and half
living corpse into the river. The jury found the
monster guilty on the clearest evidence; indeed, he
hardly denied the charge, having been seen in the
act of murder by a neighbouring householder;
and the utmost punishment the law allowed was
awarded,&mdash;he was ordered to be confined in the
prison. The fine for wilful murder of a slave was,
I found, about fifty louis (100<i>l</i>. of state or local currency),
and seven for pulling out the wretched creature's
tongue. This is, I understand, the general
law of the slave-countries in America. The law of an
English island, the oldest and the most peopled by
whites, and called by them Little England, was
quoted to me, which enacts that if 'any one maims
or kills a slave in punishing him, he shall pay no
fine; but if any one of wantonness, or bloody-mindedness,
or cruel intention, wilfully kill a negro
or other slave, he shall pay 11<i>l</i>. 4s. (about twelve
louis d'or).' They said the title of this law was
'An act for the security of the subject, to prevent
the forfeiture of life and alike upon killing a negro
or other slave.'</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 145 -->

<p>"I found that a wholesale system of punishment
is established in this town. There is an apparatus
at the common gaol, where a public flogger attends,
and any master who has suspected his slaves of rebellious
designs or other offences, sends them to the
place; they are tied up with their limbs stretched
over a rack, and the number of stripes is then
accurately administered. But I speak not of private
individuals only; official authorities hold the selfsame
course. I read myself an advertisement
signed by the keeper of a prison and the Marshal
announcing that a female of colour had been sent to
the gaol suspected of being a runaway slave; that
she was in a state of mental derangement; and that
if she should not be claimed immediately, she must
be sold to pay the prison fees. This happened in a
country the inhabitants of which pride themselves
upon their famous Declaration of Independence,
one of the finest compositions I ever read. It proclaims
as 'a truth fundamental and self-evident,
that all men are created equal, and endowed by God
with inalienable rights, whereof one is the title to
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'&mdash;Can this
passage ever be read by the American lawgivers of
the south without a blush?</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 146 -->

<p>"I began to think I had seen enough, and expressed
myself so to the captain when he came to ask
me how I did after our voyage and storm. He was
a man from the Eastern States, and not the slave
country; and on my saying I believed I had seen
slavery in its worst form, he said, 'Oh, nor any thing
like it. You have but seen slavery in its holiday-dress,
the slavery of the house-servants, who are tolerably
well fed, not overworked, and never exposed to the
sun or the night cold of this variable climate. Go
to the plantations, where they perish in the unwholesome
rice-grounds, and I am told that the sugar
planting beats even this. But at any rate go to the
market.'&mdash;'And why to the market?' asked I. 'Are
the slaves sent there to bear burthens, or to wash
away the offal in this sultry weather?'&mdash;'No, no,'
said the Captain, 'but they be the beasts as is sold
from hand to hand, after being turned up to be
overhauled like other cattle. I'm agone (a-going)
there as now to meet a friend, and I'll take
you.'</p>

<p>"To this scene of special cruelty and suffering
we accordingly went, and I shall not soon forget its
effects on my mind. There did I see some six or
seven score of human beings, fellow-creatures of ourselves,

<!-- vol 2 page 147 -->

children of the same common father, Christians
and heirs of the same blessed hope, penned together,
men and women, the old and the young, like the
beasts which perish; and all exposed to sale by their
owners, who stood by explaining their merits, descanting
on the healthiness of one, the strength and agility
of another, the good temper of this woman to her
children, the tendency of that other easily to breed.
They would show the persons of their live stock,
and make the purchaser feel the joints how they
were knit, the muscles how firm, the sinews how
powerful; affirm there was no blemish or speck;
desire a torch to be brought and held near that
the eyesight might be proved clear. One fine youth I
observed was offered at a peculiarly high price. It
seems that he had been on board ship, and by this
accident had learnt to read and write, so that he
might be worked as a clerk in a warehouse, or even
a book-keeper in a counting-house. Then if he
is expected to fetch so very much higher a price,'
I asked, 'how happens it that more are not thus
taught?'&mdash;'Oh, no,' said the captain, 'you are no
American lawyer, I guess, or you would not ask the
question. It is forbidden under the severest penalties
to teach any slave or indeed any free person of

<!-- vol 2 page 148 -->

colour, reading and writing; and in some of the
States this is even an offence punishable with death.'&mdash;'Gracious
heavens!'&mdash;I exclaimed; but my cry was
stopped by the sight I now saw. A poor woman was
going down on her knees, weeping and wailing more
piteously than I ever remember to have before seen.
But the barbarian she addressed turned a deaf ear.
She was sold, and her tender infant of a year old was
not sold with her, the price asked having been refused.
Her agony was grievous at being now first
separated from this, infant, whose little swarthy arms
were stretched out towards her neck. The master,
the seller 'of the lot,' as they termed it, was inexorable;
the baby was rudely torn from her; and she
was hauled away by the purchaser, and driven with
kicks and blows off the ground. In as plain English
as I could command, I expressed my horror,
and said how willingly I would make up the difference
in the price had I the money. I only raised a
grin on the man's countenance:&mdash;'Very pretty fool
you'd make on yourself, if you did such nonsense.
Why, master, you must be an outlandish sort of a
person, as is heard in your tongue, to think them
there creatures like us. Why, they be but niggers,
man, and not white like us. What would you

<!-- vol 2 page 149 -->

have?'&mdash;I saw but too truly in this the fundamental
principle of the whole&mdash;they were not regarded
as of the same species with their masters.
Everywhere in the market you saw the poor child
clinging to its mother's knees, terrified at the
thoughts of being torn from her. Each family
group seemed frightened to distraction as often as
any one of the purchasers in going round the market
approached to examine them; for all had present
to their minds as the worst of dangers, the risk
of a separation.</p>

<p>Painful as were these sensations which the separation
of the young gave, I know not that I felt less at
the sight of age stripped of all honours, which I witnessed
at a sale I presently after attended. It was
by auction, and the subject was an old woman, of a
mild though suffering aspect. The salesman described
her as fit for a good housekeeper, one who
might go for a few hundred dollars, and save yearly
as much; for 'who,' he asked, 'could get any help
(servant) for less than two or three hundred dollars
wages, a-year? What young lady (female servant)
would work for less?'&mdash;A bidder came up and began
feeling under the poor creature's ribs; she coughed,
and he asked if she was well? 'Oh, no; I am very

<!-- vol 2 page 150 -->

ill,' answered she softly, and in a mournful tone of
voice.&mdash;'And what ails you?'&mdash;'Oh, I have had a
cough and pain in the side for three months.'&mdash;'Ah,
the cunning old creature,' said the auctioneer, 'she
but shams and shirks. A taste of the cow-hide
(whip) will cure her fast enough.' However, all his
puffing, which he interlarded with the most coarse,
unfeeling, and often indecent jests, would not avail,
and she was 'knocked down' at seventy dollars.
'A bloody lot of skin and bone,' said a bystander.&mdash;'I
guess,' said another, 'the land-crabs will soon
have a taste of her.' And the poor dying creature
was led off by her purchaser to lay down her head,
first on the ground of his plantation, and soon afterwards
under it, being plainly on her passage to
those realms where all are indeed equal, where none
suffer, and where masters can torment no more.
Here, again, I felt and expressed the inference at
each moment coming over the mind on surveying
such scenes, that the slave is not regarded as of his
master's species. My captain, who under a somewhat
rough weather-beaten outside, had really a
heart in its right place, confirmed me in this observation.
He added, that strange to tell, the prejudice
was not confined to slaves, but went along

<!-- vol 2 page 151 -->

with the colour. Even free negroes were not suffered
to be taught; and so strict was the superintendence
exercised over them, that no one was suffered
to leave the State, on penalty should he cross the
border of never being permitted to return. 'It
thus happens,' said he, 'that if you have a free
black in your employment, who is married and has
a family here like, should you send him, inadvertently,
a message across the boundary line that
separates the one Carolina from the other, he is for
ever banished from his family, and the same law
holds as to even those who are in easy circumstances,
many who are wealthy inhabitants.' I asked if there
was such risk of insurrection as to account, for all
these precautions. 'That there is no such risk is
more than I will just go to affirm,' he said, 'though
I am sure the apprehension greatly exaggerates it.
But with regard to the free people of colour it is
quite absurd; for they have always been found to
take part with the whites, in cases of negro revolt.
I guess they are proud of seeming to belong to the
upper class, and drawing a distinction as wide as
may be between themselves and the slaves, just,' he
added, 'as you very generally see your shopkeepers
to be more aristocratic and more apt to look down

<!-- vol 2 page 152 -->

upon common labourers, than even gentlefolks. So
at least we find it in this free country.'</p>

<p>" 'This free country!' I cried, 'Gracious God!
and is this country, where I have within the last eight
and forty hours witnessed more scenes of tyranny, of
cruel capricious tyranny, not in one man but pervading
the whole community&mdash;this country where half
its human inhabitants are groaning, smarting, wailing
in a state of bondage more bitter than any with
which the far-famed despots of the East can bind their
subjects&mdash;this country in which the labouring classes
are all without one exception held, not metaphorically
but actually, in chains and fetters, scourged,
tortured, murdered, treated like cattle, and worse
than any cattle are treated, only suffered to have
the feelings of man that their pride may be insulted,
their affections outraged, their hearts torn by every
torment that a sentient nature can endure&mdash;is this
country to be called free, to boast of its liberty, and
its inhabitants even to look down upon the rest of
mankind as enslaved and enthralled compared with
themselves?'&mdash;When some such exclamations burst
from me, the captain generally agreed with what
I expressed, that is to say after his colder fashion,
and with some national feeling for his countrymen.

<!-- vol 2 page 153 -->

He said he felt as all in the North and East of
the States did, how deeply humiliating this great blot
was upon the American character. 'But,' he said,
'let us all the while be just, even to slave-holders
and slave-traders. The difficulty of dealing with
the question is greater than may at first appear.
To free the slaves at once is quite impossible. Then
as long as slavery exists, the manners of the people
must be changed, nay the nature of men must be
changed before the miseries of the poor slave can
be greatly mitigated. And one grand difficulty
stands in the way of a legislative change; even of a
gradual one, as gradual it must be to have a chance
of being safe. The black people multiply so fast
that they are sure, everywhere in the south, greatly
to outnumber the whites. This much augments
the embarrassment, and will speedily reduce both the
local governments of the States, and the individual
proprietors, to great straits in the management of
the coloured population. However,' added the
captain, 'bad as all you have seen is, the worst part
of the dismal picture remains to appal you; I mean
the import traffic by which all this misery and
shame has been occasioned, the African Slave
Trade; and, let us be just to the colonies,&mdash;they

<!-- vol 2 page 154 -->

wished long ago to prevent it, and then desired to
abolish it, as if they had foreseen the evils of which
it was to prove the fruitful parent. The mother
country, England, our severer tyrant, the King and
the Parliament of England, to the utter disgrace
both of their humanity and their wisdom, would not
hear of it, and compelled the southern States to
continue importing negroes, whether they would
or no.'</p>

<p>"To all that my friend the captain could urge
upon the great difficulty of an emancipation, and his
demand of a plan which might be feasible and safe,
I had only to answer, that in one direction I could
clearly enough see my way. 'There may be,' said I,
'some difficulty in freeing the negroes now in your
States; but surely there can be none in stopping the
frightful enormity which brings, yearly, more of these
wretched beings over from Africa; and which, while
you call it a trade, you describe as a crime of the
most heinous kind, telling me that the sight of it
(which you have undergone) would drive from my
recollection all that I have seen of negro misery in
this country.'&mdash;'Why, that measure I hold to be
quite inevitable,' said he. 'The total abolition of the
slave-traffic, I am clear, must take place as soon as

<!-- vol 2 page 155 -->

our new federal government is well settled.'&mdash;'But
then,' I added, 'surely another step, in the self-same
direction, must swiftly follow. Why not, at once,
prohibit the internal slave-traffic; the removing, by
force, without the semblance, or any pretence, of a
consent on their part, thousands of negro slaves bred
in one part of your territory, to be worked in another,
in clearing new land, the most unhealthy of employments,
as you the other day allowed, and torn, by
compulsion, from the place of their birth and the
society of their families?'&mdash;The captain did not
feel disposed to question this position; but he also
said that there was some difficulty attending its
practical adoption from the overbalance of hands in
some slave-settlements.</p>

<p>"While discussing the subject we had walked a
little way out of the town, and were on the road
towards the west, where Georgia lies. We saw
a crowd before us, but moving though slowly, in
regular order; and, on coming up with their line,
it proved to be formed of negroes, yoked together
like so many cattle, and secured by wooden billets
or beams, through holes in which their heads
seemed thrust, while the rest of the timber weighed
upon them to prevent either resistance or escape.

<!-- vol 2 page 156 -->

These were slaves going, or rather driven, to the
Western States, from the well supplied market of
Charlestown. No slave-trader had arrived for some
weeks from Africa (from 'the coast,' as it was familiarly
called); so that these people had all been born
and bred in the country. They were of both sexes,
and of various ages, but for the most part young;
some were little older than children. All were
forced to keep the same pace, in order that a single
driver or two, I may say drover, might suffice to
superintend the convoy or herd. Being all Creoles,
(or American born negroes) they spoke English, and
understood it perfectly; and we entered into conversation
with some of them, who appeared sufficiently
intelligent, though I should say that generally
their faculties are inferior in acuteness to those
of Europeans. What moved me, however, beyond
anything I can describe, was the feelings these poor
creatures experienced, and which they expressed with
a simplicity more touching than any finished eloquence
could have been.&mdash;'Oh dear, dear Master'
(Massa, meaning only Sir) 'I must no more see
my poor old mother! she is left near Charlestown;
and I have a sister with her. It grieves me very
sore.' A little girl, whose mother had died long

<!-- vol 2 page 157 -->

ago, kept crying all the way, that her young brother
was not brought away; but most, she said, because
her father never again would see her, and this, she
knew, would break the poor nigger-man's old heart.
It was an affecting thing to hear, as the train moved
on, a low, rather sweet, sound rising from it, as of
voices chaunting a hymn. In fact, these poor creatures,
partly to beguile the way, but also with religious
feelings that thus formed some consolation
for their misery, occasionally sung one of the hymns
the methodist preachers had taught them. Some of
them, however, held aloof from this exercise, as if
in proud disdain, and not choosing to complain.
'They tell me,' said one of a deep jet-black, and of
a haughty, even fierce aspect, whom the captain at
once recognized as of Koromantyn blood, 'They tell
me the country we are going to in the west is good
for us;&mdash;it is unwholesome; and the work in it is
sure to kill us! What better can a slave to the
white man desire than to be relieved from a world
made for white men's pleasure, and the place of the
black men's torment?'&mdash;The driver heard a few of
the last words, and immediately gave the negro a
heavy blow on the back, and another on the face,
adding, with a sneer, 'Take that, you rebellious,

<!-- vol 2 page 158 -->

discontented brute, you! You've no more religion
than a black-beetle, for all you were sold at the
price of a Christian.'&mdash;The look of the Koromantyn
was such, so mixed with fury and scorn, that I
felt for the moment relieved when I saw how
heavily he was loaded, bitterly as I felt with him
on his wrongs.&mdash;'Look you, then,' said the driver,
'my fine young gentleman, it's no more nor no less
than right down nonsense of you to jabber with them
niggers as if they were Americans or Englishers;
'cause I expect they've got no more sense than
oxen, and are as obstinate as outright pigs, I calculate.'
A remark which his unfeeling behaviour and
stupid words drew from me gave offence to this
republican. 'What, truly!' cried he, 'would you
have us free-born Americans deprived of our rights?
Shall we have no property in our own cattle, and
our own niggers? A pretty use we've got of our
long war if it is come to that! Why, I calculate
we might better have been as we were than fight
it hard out to be slaves, forsooth, of our own
blacks!'</p>

<p>"The captain took me one day to visit a friend
of his, in a very handsome country house, about a
league from Charlestown. The grounds were agreeably

<!-- vol 2 page 159 -->

laid out, the woods were beautiful, and the
house fitted up and kept with every luxury which
wealth could command. The family were not unpleasing;
the ladies had been educated in Paris,
and the master of the house had served in the
Carolina militia during a part of the war, till a
wound obliged him to return home. We passed
two days at this villa; and I might have passed
them agreeably, but the curse of the country was
upon it, and upon all within it. Negro slavery!&mdash;the
master, the owner and his human chattel&mdash;the
tyrant and the slave!&mdash;this monstrous state of things
not only filled the imagination and distressed the
feelings, but exerted its baneful influence on the
whole constitution of the society I was in. A blow,
or a kick, was the admonition to a servant who
made any mistake which in France would have
called forth a word of reproof. The young ladies
would hardly give themselves the trouble to turn
aside the silver tea-kettle that was ready to scald the
man who held the tea-pot under it. One of the
men was desired to go catch a copper-head (a most
poisonous snake) to shew me, and if he could find a
rattle-snake in the thicket a little way off, to be sure
to bring it living, that I might hear the rattle. I found

<!-- vol 2 page 160 -->

that slaves were so little regarded as human beings
that their presence in a room no more restrained
a person than if so many dogs were there. The
master and mistress of the house had a negro girl,
of twenty, always sleeping, on the floor, in the same
bed-room with themselves. 'Else,' said the lady,
'how should I possibly do if I wanted a glass of
water in the night? Truly, there is nothing in that;
she's but a nigger-girl!' The captain told me that
the most delicate women will lace their stays and
put on most of their clothes, while a negro-man
stands by to deliver a message or take an order.
Worst of all, in this house, one of the most respectable
in Carolina, I was asked by an upper-servant,
a kind of house steward, on going to bed, if I wished
to have a negress girl brought to me as a companion
for the night. The greatest laxity prevails in this
respect, among even persons who would shrink from
encouraging any illicit intercourse among whites.
Most of the country gentlemen, the planters, were
the fathers of many mulattos still held in slavery
on their estates, and even in their families; nor was
it supposed that great nicety was observed in avoiding
impure connection with their own nearest relatives
thus produced. In North America it is

<!-- vol 2 page 161 -->

possible this may be little known, though it seemed
not to be much doubted. I have since found it
quite usual in the West Indies. The captain further
assured me, that the breeding of slaves was carried
on in Virginia and the Carolinas, precisely as that
of cattle would be. A barren woman fetched a
lower price than one who had just had her first
child. A man would be compelled to have several
wives, with a view to offspring; and, with the same
view, a woman would occasionally be obliged to
change her husband. In a word, all feelings of
delicacy, all consideration of the slave, all thoughts
of him as a fellow-creature, seem to be banished
from the country, and extirpated from the minds of its
inhabitants by this accursed system, which appears
to disfigure not only the mind of man, but the very
face of Nature.</p>

<p>"And yet all these scenes of human wretchedness,
and of perverted human feelings, I witnessed in a
country into whose lap bountiful Nature has poured
her choicest gifts, enriching it with every variety that
man's wants can require, of the most fertile soil,
and adorning it with matchless beauties to please
his senses. There are, perhaps, no magnificent
forests in this part of the Union, nor have the rivers,

<!-- vol 2 page 162 -->

noble as they are, the prodigious grandeur of the
northern streams. But any thing more rich than the
luxuriant and infinitely varied foliage, with every
fine form and tint of flower, and every fantastic shape
of leaf, and every shade of green on which the eye
can dwell for refreshment or repose, it is impossible
to imagine. Nor is it only such permanent hues that
the American forest wears. A night of frost in
autumn suddenly variegates the foliage like magic.
Then the wood literally is in a blaze of orange and
brown, yellow and deep red, even flaming scarlet
tints. No untravelled person can picture to himself a
more delightful scene. The air, too, is filled with splendour.
Even to me, bred in Languedoc, the illumination
of the fire-fly was almost new, so greatly did
it exceed in brilliancy all that I had known at home.
No sooner was the sun down than the night seemed
filled, and the air peopled with myriads of this restless
insect, glancing to and fro, darting their train
of soft, lambent flame from twig to twig, till they
seemed to light up the whole grove. But the wood
was more lively by day, not only from its vegetable
but its insect wonders. The flowers seemed to have
taken wing, so great was the number of butterflies
that painted the air, flying about in every fantastic

<!-- vol 2 page 163 -->

course, and shining in the sun with all the colours of
the rainbow, beside two which the rainbow has not,
and which, by their contrast with each other and with
the rest, form a pleasing variety, pure white and jet
black, often combined in the same insect. Rose-colour,
orange, bright blue, with or without spots to
mottle them, on wings of a breadth and form unknown
in our latitudes, flit before the eyes and dance through
the air in endless variety. Here there is found also
the curse of the southern clime, the reptile with the
insect. The terrible rattle-snake does not approach
the town; but not less venomous is the copper-head,
which the Americans, with their faculty of
giving everything a vulgar abbreviation when they
cannot confer on it a grotesque name, call 'a <i>copper;</i>'
and in some moist situations the plague of
huge and noisy frogs is felt, and the unpleasant
though harmless lizard, of prodigious size, is far
from a pleasing variety in the infinite luxuriance
of animal life which forms the great characteristic of
the southern country, and is, I am told, still more
remarkable in South America, beyond the Gulf and
the Isthmus.</p>

<p>"It became necessary for me to think of a subsistence,
and I consulted the honest captain, who

<!-- vol 2 page 164 -->

found me disinclined to continue in the sea-service,
now that the war being over, his frigate was sure to
be paid off. He recommended me to apply for
employment as a clerk in a merchant's house. But
nothing could induce me to fill any place that might
bring me in contact with slavery and the slave-trade,
to which the dealings of all mercantile houses
in these countries must have some relation. It was
therefore settled that with the small sum due to me
for my wages during the three months I had served
on board ship, I should travel to the Northern
States, where I could have little difficulty in being
engaged at a moderate salary. Accordingly I set
out from Charlestown by a diligence which went at
a slow but steady pace, and carried me through
magnificent forests, and over a number of broad and
clear rivers, towards Philadelphia, where we arrived
in about a week."</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="small">A SECOND CHAPTER:&mdash;THE NEW WORLD.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">There</span> are seasons when a particular idea will
enter the mind, take possession of it, and give rise
to a train of thought, without our being able either
to account for its commencement, or to break the
thread and put an end to it; but I have more commonly
observed this to happen with associations of
a calm and not unpleasing kind than with those
which agitate and harass, as if the mind had some
power of rejecting the more disagreeable thoughts.
Accordingly I have very rarely been visited in my
dreams with any such unwelcome images, any more
than indeed one is apt to dream of recent scenes;
we rather go back to early life. On this tedious
journey, while slowly traversing one of the vast
forests filled with oaks of a truly prodigious girth as
well as height, and which for want of underwood,
showed their massive trunks to the eye, I found myself

<!-- vol 2 page 166 -->

dwelling upon the recollections of Avignon, but
above all of my beloved mother. I could not get
out of my mind the picture of her sitting over her
missal, praying for me or looking at some letter
respecting me, and sadly heaving a sigh to think she
should never see me more. The security in which I
had felt ever since my arrival in America, the certainty
I was in that nothing could now disturb me,
provided I only obtained employment enough to
support life, had no doubt relieved my mind from
all the anxiety I so long suffered under, and only
left a bitter recollection of the melancholy beginning
of my troubles. The idea of Father Jerome had
haunted me in the stillness of the voyage before the
storm began; that of my parent was now the companion
of my way. I felt as if I could no longer
bear the thought that we should never again meet
on earth. I seemed ready to resolve that I would
encounter any hazard in order once more to lay my
head on the bosom that had so often cherished me.
It is strange how entirely these images prevented
me from thinking of Louise. It seemed as if I felt
all my remorse awakened with my filial affection,
and that I charged myself with the sufferings my
mother was enduring in her lonely hours when she

<!-- vol 2 page 167 -->

thought of her wandering son as lost. But months
had passed since I had had any tidings from the
Cont&acirc;t, and months must again roll over my
head ere I could hear. For until I should be
settled in some one place, I could not apprize
either the good pastor of Nismes or M. Girard of
my address.</p>

<p>"There was not much difficulty on arriving at
Philadelphia in procuring employment. I was not
very nice as to terms, and agreed for my board and
fifty louis a-year to keep a small merchant's books,
whose only clerk had left him to clear a wood track
and live as all do that can scrape together a few
hundred dollars, and have a wife and family to help
them in their speculations; for, unlike a person's
situation in Europe, his having a wife and children
is, in this country of cheap and good land and few
inhabitants, a relief and not a burthen.</p>

<p>"In Philadelphia I remained for above two years
thus employed; my situation was not uncomfortable.
But though I respected the family I lived in, I
found no inclination to cultivate the friendship of
persons so entirely different from myself in their
habits of thinking, and all whose feelings seemed
centered in one pursuit, the acquiring of money.

<!-- vol 2 page 168 -->

My hours too passed wearily; for in the whole of the
time I had but one letter from Nismes, and it gave
an indifferent account of Louise's health. From
herself I heard not a word; and the great age of
M. Girard led me to dread that the heavy blow from
which he in vain strove to seem as if he had recovered,
had laid him prostrate, and that affliction
had shortened his life and his misery. My hope
was that had it been so M. Gardein would have
apprized me of our loss.</p>

<p>"Having now saved some three hundred dollars,
I relieved my mind from the load of anxiety that
pressed upon it, by several excursions to New
York and its beautiful neighbourhood, and to the
Eastern cities, where the genuine character and
manners of the Americans are to be seen in their
most perfect state. The scenery of the north also
had its attractions. The Hudson river, its rocky
passes, the extent of its bays, the variety of the
ground which bounds it, sometimes rocky and
precipitous, sometimes champaign, here bare and
awful, there crowned or fringed with wood, has
certainly no equal for beauty in any stream I have
ever seen. But the St. Lawrence, which I went on
purpose to see, not so much for the sake of the

<!-- vol 2 page 169 -->

famous falls, of which I could form an idea, but
for the sake of gazing on one of the giant rivers of
the earth, the mighty stream that drains a whole continent,
flows a thousand leagues, and forms or traverses
lakes like seas, one of three hundred leagues in
length; to fill my eyes with such a spectacle seemed
a kind of duty while I was residing in its neighbourhood.
Accordingly I went thither, and though it did
not quite answer my expectation, because it had the
breadth, where I first saw it, of a firth or arm of the
sea rather than a river, and moved so slow as not to
have a perceptible current, yet its prodigious width,
across which the eye could not reach, coupled with
the certainty that it was a flowing stream, was calculated
to impress the mind with awe rather than mere
wonder. Some way higher up, I had a full view of
it as a current; I stood in mute astonishment at
the majestic stream, four leagues in width, rolling
slowly its prodigious body of waters to the Atlantic
main. The mind was lost in contemplation of
the mighty works of nature; the creature sank into
insignificance in presence of the marvels of his
Maker's omnipotence; the spectacle of power on the
most boundless scale laid the soul prostrate; the
idea of vast magnitude seemed alone to fill the

<!-- vol 2 page 170 -->

mind, to shut out all other thoughts, and to constitute
the true sublime; the imagination was carried
back to the creation of all things when the great
tide was let loose, and piercing the iron wall of huge
rock, had rolled onward through countless ages; the
mind was then carried forward towards the yet more
remote ages through which its flood was appointed
still to roll, feeding the ocean with its waters.</p>

<p>"About the beginning of the year 1784, the
unbroken peace abroad and at home had left the
Congress free to discuss the plans of a permanent
constitution for the country; but no progress had
as yet been made in framing it. There were many
misgivings among public men that this new, untried
experiment of a great and populous country living
under a purely republican government, might not
be found successful in practice. But there was one
comfort ever present to all men's minds; there was
one man ever in their eyes upon whose wisdom, firmness,
and virtue, boundless reliance might be placed
in whatever difficulties the State might be involved.
Washington, who had borne them triumphant
through all their perils, yet lived, though retired, in
the vigour of his faculties; and what form of government
soever the people might ultimately shape for

<!-- vol 2 page 171 -->

themselves, at its head he was sure to be set, if his
unaffected preference of a private station could be
overcome by the unanimous entreaties of his fellow
citizens. I had a natural desire to see this extraordinary
man, and a deputation of the Philosophic
Society of Philadelphia having been directed to
wait upon him with an address, asking him to be
an honorary member, I obtained permission through
a literary friend to accompany them. We arrived
at Mount Vernon, his spacious, classical country-seat,
like himself, grand but simple and unostentatious;
and we had the high honour of being invited
to dine with him and his family.</p>

<p>"The presence of this truly great man struck me
with reverence. He was upwards of fifty years
old, above the middle size, of a mild, reflecting,
and noble countenance, and his manners were as
calm, and, if I may so speak, as majestic, as suited
his character, simple and serene. He engaged but
little in conversation, though perfectly at his ease,
and exceedingly affable without the least appearance
of vulgar condescension. There was something at
once benevolent and decided in the expression of his
mouth, but I never once observed him to smile; his
eyes were intelligent, but with no fire; and although

<!-- vol 2 page 172 -->

he is known to be a man of vehement temper, it is
still better known that he has this temper under
strict and habitual control. The subjects that
seemed most to interest him were those connected
with farming, and the care of cattle and of woods,
on which he asked several questions. Of politics
he said little; nor indeed did the news of the
day furnish any topics of importance, except, only
that I remember his pronouncing a decided opinion
in favour of Lord Lansdowne, and of Mr. Pitt,
both of whom he said had been attacked most
unjustly and most factiously by a set of men from
part, at least, of whom&mdash;the old Whig party&mdash;he
should have expected better things. Of Lord Chatham
he spoke with respect for his vigour, and his
free spirit; his eloquence he valued less, and in
wisdom he was, according to the General, wholly
deficient; nor did he think a person who had no
command of himself ever could command others.
He considered his son as certain to make the greater
statesman of the two in all respects, but that his
coming so early to power deprived him of the discipline
of experience. Mr. Fox he praised, saying
he supposed the character he lately had seen of him
was just, that he was the most amiable of great

<!-- vol 2 page 173 -->

men, and the greatest among amiable. But the
General said he seemed the slave of faction, and was
little likely to be set free, because he appeared to
exalt party spirit into a principle of duty. Of Lord
North he spoke with exemplary candour, expressing
his conviction that his persisting in the American
contest was owing much less to his own opinions
than to his deference towards the English King;
but he added that such deference was to be severely
blamed, inasmuch as it deprived the country of its
only security against a weak or a wicked prince,
and made monarchy the very worst of all governments.</p>

<p>"One of our deputation made a remark on the
accounts from England of some steps to be taken
for reforming the representation, and some for
doing away with civil disabilities on account of
religious opinions. The General highly approved
both proceedings; and shortly expressed his belief
that some extension of the elective franchise, if
granted in time, would prop up the ancient and
time-worn monarchy; but on the question of toleration
he was still more decided; and related an
anecdote (the only one he told, and the only allusion
he made to the War of Independence), that finding

<!-- vol 2 page 174 -->

there was to be a Sacrament of the Lord's Supper
administered while he lay encamped in New Jersey,
he asked the clergyman, a sectary, if other religionists
might join, whose answer was, 'It is the
Lord's table, and not the Calvinists';' upon which,
said the General, 'highly approving his principle, I
attended myself, though of another persuasion, and
sat down with my fellow Christians of all denominations,
as why should I not?'&mdash;There never was, I
believe, a fouler aspersion than the story propagated
by some free-thinkers, that he is a man of no religion.
His education has been very confined; he
knows no ancient language, hardly a little French;
his reading is confined to history. Of poetry he
may have read somewhat; and it is said, when a
youth, he excerpted and copied some hymns, and
other religious writings, and no more. Of science
he is only possessed to the extent of arithmetic and
land-surveying, including of course a little plane
geometry and trigonometry. But his celebrated
address on retiring from the chief command of the
army, breathes the most ardent wishes for human
improvement, and the utmost reverence for the
great masters of philosophy who have enlightened
the world; and I heard him reprehend some one

<!-- vol 2 page 175 -->

who was cited as holding cheap the votaries of religion.
'He is not so clever as many who have believed,'
said the General. 'No man knew more of
physical evidence than Newton, or of moral than
Locke, or of legal than Hale, and all of these
were sincere Christians.'&mdash;'Your young friend,' I
ventured to add, 'would not perhaps be in company
he should be ashamed of were he to join
them.' The General nodded in assent to my remark,
and seemed to testify his approval by asking me to
drink a glass of wine with him after the American
and English fashion.</p>

<p>"I came away from Mount Vernon with the
deepest veneration for this great man. Many of
more brilliant faculties have been seen both in civil
and military life; to what is called genius he
makes no pretence; his fame as a captain is so
obscure that his defeats and failures are much more
easily reckoned up than his victories; learning, eloquence,
whatever most strikes mankind, and is most
imposing, are wholly foreign to him; yet by his
inflexible firmness under every difficulty, his undaunted
contempt of danger, whether we regard his
personal courage or his moral, his bearing manfully
up at times when the stoutest hearts might well have

<!-- vol 2 page 176 -->

despaired, and steadfastly persevering when any
continued exertion seemed but hopeless pertinacity;
he maintained the elements of a wild and undisciplined
democracy in subordination and in union; he
wore out the most disciplined troops and the most
experienced commanders; he supplied the want of
all other resources, with the inexhaustible resource
of his own indomitable will; and he carried his
country through her struggle&mdash;her all but hopeless
struggle&mdash;to a triumph which enthroned free principles
upon the ruins of a tyranny that he had crumbled
in the dust, called into existence a great nation,
and gave it from its birth a first place among the
powers of the civilized world.</p>

<p>"Wherever you go in America, in whatever
company&mdash;among the Federalists, as they are
termed, or among the Democrats&mdash;even among the
friends of monarchy, of whom there are very few
indeed, but these much respected for their sacrifices
and the ill-treatment they have undergone&mdash;you
hear but one opinion, see but one feeling, respecting
this extraordinary man; all admire, love and trust
him. The moderate party, who lean more to
England, know that against England he is implacable,
and that the only way to ruffle his temper is

<!-- vol 2 page 177 -->

to praise her, or to speak respectfully of General
Arnold; yet that party look up to him as their
refuge in a season of trouble. The high republicans
who would level all existing institutions, and wish to
see the world parcelled out among commonwealths,
regard him with equal veneration as the father of
liberty and their safeguard against the return of
both English power and monarchy. All men are
as confident as they can be of a future event, that
were he placed at the head of the Federacy, as he
must be by common consent when the constitution
is formed, he would only keep office for the public
good; would hold the balance even among contending
parties; would religiously avoid all encroachments
on the rights of the people; and would,
after maintaining the country in unbroken peace
abroad and tranquillity at home, insist upon resigning
his authority the instant that the safety of the State
permitted him to return once more into the privacy
which he loves.</p>

<p>"I returned to Philadelphia well pleased with
my expedition to Virginia, and I was still more
pleased with seeing a letter from the dear pastor
of Nismes, in which, and indeed on the same sheet
of paper, were these delightful lines from Louise.

<!-- vol 2 page 178 -->

'Dearest Friend&mdash;I am wearing away my days
in hopeless solitude, beginning to give up all expectation
of our ever again meeting in this world.
Oh, Albert! if you only knew how I have been
harassed on your account, and because of my
unchangeable fidelity to our vows! But God
knows it is no fault of yours, dearest, and we must
submit patiently to the decrees of the Great Disposer.
I desire you would look to the moon's mild
silver face on the first of the next month but one,
at about two in the morning. I reckon that this
will be six weeks hence. I shall be turning my
eyes at the same silent hour towards the same sweet
lamp of the sky (which however will be gone down
from its meridian by two hours here, and will want
three hours of its height when you see it). It will
give me a pleasing sensation to think that we are
gazing on the same object at the same time.
Look for half an hour, that the time may be sure
to agree.'</p>

<p>"Another year passed away in the same regular
routine, without any incident worth relating. But
I had more opportunity than before to witness the
singular spectacle, wholly new to me of course, but
also novel in the history of our species, of an extensive

<!-- vol 2 page 179 -->

and populous country ruled by a pure
democracy, a great state the people of which governed
themselves, without a monarch, without
hereditary aristocracy, without an established
church. This system of policy had been far too
recently formed to afford the means of judging
what might be the success of so new an experiment;
the government was indeed not yet framed,
the first administration of the Union continuing to
manage the public concerns. But that administration
was purely republican; the popular voice
guided the whole movements of the machine; and I
had thus the means of observing the effects of democratic
power. I was struck, beyond every other
feature, with the unceasing, all-pervading, and absolutely
uncontrolled action of this central force.
Under no despotic government can the ruling
authority be so searching; under none can it be
more irresistible. The tyrant is everywhere; he
approaches close to each of his subjects. The majority
of the people is that tyrant, and none can
escape him. There must be no opposition to his
will, no undervaluing of his authority, no treating
him lightly; the least disrespect either towards
his person, or his will, or his measures, or even

<!-- vol 2 page 180 -->

his language, is visited severely; and the very
man who in private may have joined in expressing
some sentiment contrary to the prevailing opinion,
or some opinion disapproving the conduct of the
ruling party, would be the first to shrink from
a public repetition of the same statements as soon
as the public indignation should be roused and
pointed against the offending dissident.</p>

<p>"The laws, too, are executed, as well as made,
under the immediate and direct influence of the majority;
their execution is thus interfered with, and
not rarely opposed. While I was at New York a
newspaper editor had expressed an unpopular opinion
respecting the relations of the Union with Old England.
The multitude assembled; they broke the
printing-presses; they attacked the dwelling-house
of one editor; the armed force, the militia, was called
out; no one dared come to the muster; to save the
men's lives they were thrown into prison; the mob
forced the gaol doors, and killed one of the editors
upon the spot, severely wounding the others. When
the offenders were brought to trial, the mob again
prevailed, the jury not daring to give a verdict of
conviction. This is certainly a kind of outrage that
cannot be often committed, but it may be occasionally;

<!-- vol 2 page 181 -->

and in a lesser degree the same mob-law
often prevails. The total want of support from any
quarter which whoever ventures to go against public
opinion is sure to experience, is among the most
cruel inflictions of this democratic tyranny; and it
is a most bitter ingredient in the cup of popular
government. My hope for America is that her new
constitution may provide salutary checks upon the
supreme power; and as a king or a nobility are
equally beyond her reach, I naturally turn to her
legal aristocracy, the body of those able and learned
men who are intrusted with the administration of
justice. Upon them is my first reliance placed;
my next is upon the system of municipal and county
government now of old date in the Union, indeed
coeval with the plantation of the colonies; that
system which has always been established for the
local administration of affairs.</p>

<p>"Having now seen as much of the new republic
as I desired, I began, towards the winter of 1784, to
feel some impatience of the life I led; and having
often heard my acquaintance who had travelled
speak of the scenes which the West Indies presented
to an observing mind, I resolved to go
thither the first convenient opportunity. One soon

<!-- vol 2 page 182 -->

offered, and I took leave of my American friends
with kindness; with thanks for the hospitality I had
experienced among them, but without much feeling
of regret.</p>

<p>"The Americans of English extraction are a
mixed race, and differ exceedingly both in their
character and in their habits, as we travel among
them from the Eastern to the Middle States, and
from these to the Southern. They have, notwithstanding
this diversity, a good deal in common, but
it is modified in degree, and it is varied in kind. If
one were to pronounce a sweeping judgment, it would
be that the Eastern States have the most respectable
character in point of honesty and principle, the
Southern the most refined in both manners and taste.
But this would be an unsatisfactory estimate; it would
leave out much that is common to both North and
South; it would assume by omission things to be
common to both which are materially varied. Nor
do I in any wise doubt that as time advances, and
as political causes operate more powerfully, these
diversities will be lessened, and more of an uniform
national character will prevail throughout all the
Union.</p>

<p>"The American generally is of an intelligent,

<!-- vol 2 page 183 -->

acute, sagacious, bold, enterprising, persevering
character. Always on the alert to protect himself,
he will neither be overreached nor subdued; and
beside the regard for his own credit individually
which always animates him, he feels a national pride
in his caste, and a contempt of all others, which
makes him neither easy to deceive, nor safe to
attack, nor agreeable to deal with. The intercourse
of this people with the people of other countries
presents them in their least amiable aspect. As
among themselves, especially in the newly-settled
territory, the constant feeling of the individual is,
'<i>I am as good as you</i>,' so this same feeling seems
ever present to the mind of the whole people when
they are brought into contact with any other nation.
But it is a feeling which necessarily offends, because
it always assumes that those they are dealing with
are making some encroachment, putting forward
some claim of superiority. 'You won't find us
Yankees behind you Englishers either in pride or
merit,' said a man I knew at New York to one who
had never uttered a word claiming any superiority
whatever for his nation. 'No doubt of it,' was the
Englishman's reply, 'but had I said one word to show
I questioned it?' Akin to this is a most vulgar and

<!-- vol 2 page 184 -->

offensive spirit of braggadocio on their national prowess
or force, a spirit I never have seen exhibited in
any other nation&mdash;neither in the vain French, nor in
the proud English, nor in the haughty Spaniards, nor
in the half-mad Poles, the four nations according to
my observation the most inflated with self-conceit, and
patriotic enthusiasm. In truth, it is not quite correct
to say that the Americans always reckon themselves
equal to every other people with whom they come
in contact; they never seem to doubt for a moment
that they are far superior to any; and though this
feeling is frequently found to prevail in the hearts of
other nations, and to be sufficiently displayed among
themselves&mdash;witness the English of Europe, witness,
too, our own countrymen of France,&mdash;yet the Americans
bear it in their countenance and have it in their
language beyond all the people I have ever seen.
They have it each individually, as others share it
collectively among them; you would always suppose
when conversing with one of them, however
humble in station, that he contained within his own
person the whole Federacy of the United States. I
remember meeting one of these in company with an
English gentleman at the Havanna, and I shall not
soon forget the American's tone in speaking of the

<!-- vol 2 page 185 -->

United States Navy ('the National Marine,' as he
was pleased to term it), of the things it had done, I
suppose by way of privateering, during the late war,
and the prodigious things it would do if war should
come again, which he seemed to consider would be
the making of his country's fortune. The well-bred
Englishman was not at all discomposed, but he
quietly said, 'All I hope is that as you are powerful,
so you will be merciful, and not sail up the
Thames and burn London.' The American did not
appear to perceive the sneer, but gave a look as
much as to say, 'Well, possibly we may spare you.'</p>

<p>"The vulgarity generally imputed to them I
think a good deal less of, partly because I am aware
that this term of reproach is so often lavished upon
those who differ from ourselves merely on account
of their differing from ourselves&mdash;partly because I
really believe that what is called vulgarity often
consists in the plain honest expression of very natural
feelings. Yet I do allow that the American
sensitive suspicion of offence never intended, their
anxiety to defend themselves against imagined attacks,
their eagerness to assert prerogatives which
no one disputes, their zealous putting forward of
pretensions to qualities which all possess or assume

<!-- vol 2 page 186 -->

they possess as a matter of course&mdash;may savour a
little of vulgarity. However, let that pass: I heed
it little. A far more important defect is that the
Americans seem to me deficient in the sense of
honour and even of common honesty. They so exclusively
direct all their faculties, all their industry,
to the bettering of their condition, that they regard
all means of succeeding lawful, or at least consider
success as covering over the means used, and constituting
a set-off to their baseness. The admiration
of skill, the bowing to success, has plainly got the
better of their natural sense of justice. They are
industrious as the Scotch; they are thrifty as the
Dutch; they are avaricious as the Jews; but
they are only to be likened to themselves in their
unbounded admiration of successful cunning, and
their absolute carelessness of the means by which
their object is attained.</p>

<p>"The whole race is careful and wary; and they
all are like townspeople. There is a peasantry,
or rather what should be a peasantry, of many
hundred thousands, occupying a measureless extent
of country, and far removed from all cultivation
in many of its districts. Myriads of them inhabit
the forest, never see the walled city, or hear the

<!-- vol 2 page 187 -->

busy hum of men, or view the shores of commerce,
or throng to the places where traders most
do congregate; yet in the whole of this vast country
you shall not meet with any vestige of the true
rustic character; there is nothing rural, nothing
simple, in a word, nothing <i>peasant;</i> all is care, if
not cunning; it is a race of traders, scattered, indeed
insulated, rural in their position, dispersed over a
wide expanse of country, but still traders, with all
the attributes of the money-getting tribe, as if they
were gathered together and concentrated upon any
given exchange in the Old World or in the New.
Nothing struck me in America more forcibly than
this peculiarity, and nothing could be less pleasing
to my contemplation.</p>

<p>"I have purposely passed over the local characteristics
of the different States. That there is much
more real piety in the Eastern or New England settlements,
though certainly a good deal mixed with
fanaticism, cannot be doubted. But I must exempt
them from all charge of either hypocrisy or intolerance.
With a deep sense of religious truth,
and a strong determination to abide each by his own
form of faith, all the various sectaries seem to live
on terms of kindness one with another, and none

<!-- vol 2 page 188 -->

of them ever objects to hear the most unrestrained
discussion of its tenets and its ritual. You may
in one company, in a stage-coach for example,
hear every shade of opinion openly professed and
zealously defended, from strict Calvinism to deism
and almost atheism, without the least offence being
taken by any person, or the least ill-humour being
testified. Probably the want of a national establishment
gives rise to this freedom of thought
and speech&mdash;it certainly proceeds from anything
rather than indifference. In the Southern States
the bane of slavery has cast a darker shade over
the national character. No human being can,
safely to his feelings and principles, exercise uncontrolled
power, especially when the victims of
his oppression are not unseen and remote, but ever
before his eye and maltreated by his own hand.
The manner of bringing up their children as companions
and playmates of the young negroes, gives
the worst effect to the dominion they are afterwards
to exercise over them, and even to their early
education. They learn betimes to tyrannize and
to torment; and the subjects of their oppression
are their playfellows. Am I wrong in tracing to
slavery the disgusting cruelty of the sports in the

<!-- vol 2 page 189 -->

Southern States? I have seen a Virginian fighting
with another, when the object of each savage
was to maim his adversary, which one, sometimes
both, fully accomplished. I once saw a brute in
the shape of a man tear out the eye of another
and show it on the palm of his hand with a grin
of exultation to the assembled crowd, who shouted
applause, while I turned away sick with disgust.
'But see there,' said a by-stander, 'My! if he as
wants the eye hav'n't bit off t'other fellow's nose.'</p>

<p>"I pass over the outward peculiarities as less
important&mdash;their offensive manners; their proneness
to give offence by so easily taking it; their rudeness
where they dare venture; their sulkiness where
they may not find it convenient to be so bold&mdash;these
things I pass over, partly because they are of inferior
moment in weighing a national character&mdash;partly
because they will inevitably be cured in the
progress of time&mdash;partly for the reasons I have
before given. But respecting, as I sincerely do, the
American people, I most anxiously hope that their
graver imperfections may never from individual
spread to become national; that public faith may
ever remain inviolate; that they may always reflect
with just pride on their high lineage, the

<!-- vol 2 page 190 -->

children and followers of the purest statesman who
ever governed the affairs of men; and that nothing
in their future annals may ever tarnish the renown
which they achieved under his governance.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p class="small">THE WEST INDIES.&mdash;SLAVE PEASANTRY.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Having</span> resolved to visit the islands of the Mexican
Gulf, I left New York in an American vessel bound
for St. Domingo. My knowledge of the English
language was now quite sufficient to enable me to
pass for an American; so that I apprehended no inconvenience
or risk from once more coming within
the power of the French laws. We had a prosperous
voyage of less than three weeks; we reached
the Bay of Gonaives, and soon entered the fine harbour
of Port-au-Prince, where I obtained accommodation
at a boarding-house upon reasonable terms.</p>

<p>"It was the month of May, and the finest season of
the year in that tropical climate; for the first rains
were over; all was fresh and green; the air was
cooled to an agreeable temperature, and this delightful
summer lasts for five months without any
very oppressive heat, certainly with none beyond the

<!-- vol 2 page 192 -->

power of the refreshing sea breezes to cool. There
was a grateful feeling in the atmosphere, above all
in evening and night, which even in Languedoc I
had never felt, delicious as our climate is. The
heavenly bodies too are here far more splendid than
in Europe. I could easily read by moonlight;
when the moon failed us the brightness of the stars
was almost a substitute for the lamp of night, and
the planet Venus, in particular, shed a light that was
dazzling. My mind was irresistibly carried back
to the lessons and the discussions of dear Father
Jerome, and I almost thought I might see the great
Croix du Midi, of which he had always spoken as
the singular glory of the southern hemisphere. But
one appearance I was not prepared for; the moon,
and indeed the sun, had not the same flat look with
which we are familiar in the northern latitudes.
They assumed a convex form, and the moon when
not full was lit up round her edges, while the central
portion was more wrapped in shade. In a word, the
globular aspect of those great orbs was manifest,
and they no longer wore the look of circular planes.</p>

<p>"The firefly could not be more abundant than in
Carolina, or more bright than I had seen it there,
nor the butterflies more gaudy. But here swarmed

<!-- vol 2 page 193 -->

other most brilliant insects, as beetles studded with
diamond-spots. No venomous reptiles, as on the
continent, rendered the evening walk perilous, or disquieted
the wanderer by day in his search of a cooling
shade. The rich and gay plumage of the birds
exceeded all I could have fancied. These shone
through the thickets in all the luxuriance of green
and yellow, alternating with blue of every shade,
and red from bright scarlet to the deepest crimson;
while the singular clearness of the atmosphere gave
to each tint redoubled brilliancy. Some of them
sung, and filled the woods with their melody, insomuch
that Columbus imagined that it was the
nightingale herself warbled here. The foliage of
the trees and their flowers and those of the shrubs
formed the body of the forest scene; orange-trees
in golden fruit and aromatic flower; the vast mahogany
shooting up its straight stem, bright red blossoms
and oval fruit; the pomegranate and sweet-smelling
acacia; the great banana with its luxuriant
fruit and long graceful purple flower, sometimes
delicately red streaked; the lower quassia blazing in
scarlet; but above all the pimento, scenting the air
with the most grateful perfume, while its blossoms
filled the eye with the most elegant forms and delicate

<!-- vol 2 page 194 -->

colours, but suffering nothing to grow beneath
its shade, and so reigning alone over a carpet of the
most splendid green turf, the effect of abundant rain
in these islands, and a beauty which in our Languedoc
climate we never can possess.</p>

<p>"The mountain districts are more wild and picturesque,
the heights in the back ground being lofty
and the summits deeply tinged with blue. Even
near the plain and in the forest are limpid brooks of
perfect transparency, rocks that rise abruptly among
the trees, or form grottoes in the wood, or hang
over the deep blue fountains. Streams of stainless
clearness flow in all directions, sometimes forming
reservoirs that resemble small lakes, sometimes
fertilizing the plain to whose irrigation they easily
lend themselves, not unfrequently dashing over
ledges of rock in falls, but falls of a beautiful and
pleasing aspect, the sight of which from their limpid
water is grateful to the eye as their noise steals
musically on the ear, unlike the roaring, thundering
cataracts of the continent, which are an object
of dread more than of admiration.</p>

<p>"But if such be the natural beauties of this fair
land, the miracles of its cultivation present to the
eye another prospect as much to be admired. The

<!-- vol 2 page 195 -->

vast plain of Artibonite is the most fertile, I believe,
in the world; I only at first surveyed it in the short
morning twilight of the Sunday, the day after I
landed; and before the noise of its waking inhabitants
was heard, or their persons could be seen;
and never did my eye light on a more beautiful
spectacle: it seemed the triumph of human industry
in turning to much profit every inch of this useful
plain, and making each particle of its rich red mould
carry some plant that bears fruit to man. The
cane prevailed generally, and its bright green gave
the whole ground the aspect of a finely cultivated
garden, more than any produce I have ever seen.
But coffee-plantations were also interspersed with
the graceful though less picturesque green leaves of
that shrub, its elegant jasmine-like white flower, and
its rich red clusters of the berry. Everywhere the
eye met marks of skill, of labour, of wealth, in the
finely drawn canals to distribute the water, in the
clean kept fences, formed of aloe hedges, to separate
the properties of this precious soil, in the solid
structure of the planters' houses, the substantial
machinery of his water-wheels and his sugar-engines,
and the countless cottages where his peasantry
were lodged. Such was the scene over which as

<!-- vol 2 page 196 -->

the sun rose to gild the landscape my eye wandered,
and on which at that silent hour of moraine it
delighted to repose.</p>

<p>"I was fatigued with my early walk, and could
not leave the house till after breakfast next day.
All that landscape was changed; and my eye
now shrank back with horror from the sight.
For the sun, which before had only shown me
the effects of industry, had now risen, and lighted
to their toil, their endless toil, that hapless
race whose extorted labour, having not any semblance
of industry, had covered the vast plain with
all the works, and all the water-courses, and all the
vegetable riches I had before admired&mdash;the tenants
of the numberless cottages I had seen&mdash;the victims
of Christian oppression stimulated by Christian
avarice, which, in return for the inexhaustible riches
of such a soil and such a climate, showed its gratitude
to the Giver of all Good by the torture and the
murder of his most harmless and peaceful children.
Yes! I was in the greatest slave-colony in the
world; I saw before me the utmost effects of this
accursed system! Spread out as on a map were the
fruits of the scourge and the chain; and the air,
fragrant with a thousand perfumes, variegated with

<!-- vol 2 page 197 -->

every colour on which the eye could dwell with
most delight, pure and transparent to the sight of
man, tempered to his senses with the most genial
warmth, kept cool by the most healthful breeze
which could fan his limbs&mdash;that air resounded with
the merciless lash, echoed the clanking chain, from
the rising to the going down of the sun.</p>

<p>"I had not recovered from my horror at finding
myself, for the first time, in a slave and sugar colony,
when I next had time to reflect on the other unnatural
circumstances in this state of things. Of the
thousands whom I saw toiling in all directions, there
was scarcely scattered here and there a single white.
The fields were swarming with negroes, of both
sexes and of every age. In a line they all worked,
the strong and the weak, the old and the young,
women and men, nay, women whose form plainly
indicated that they were far advanced in pregnancy&mdash;all
were at work, and all must keep up with the
strongest or the nimblest, at the pace prescribed;
and by whom? By another slave, who moved backwards
and forwards, armed with a long whip, which
he sometimes only cracked over the heads of the
gang, as it was called, but oftentimes laid severely
upon the backs of such as he deemed indolent or

<!-- vol 2 page 198 -->

found feeble. After waiting an hour or more, suffering
but a little less than they, I at last perceived
a white man, a person of a pale and sickly aspect,
with a loose light-coloured dress, a broad straw hat
lined with green silk, a parasol in one hand, and a
cane in the other. He walked listlessly towards the
driver, the whip-holding slave, who superintended
one of the lines or gangs, and chid him for negligence,
which was the name I found given to the
offence of sparing the slaves. The defence of the
driver was only answered with a blow from the
white man's cane. He went round to several other
gangs, and then, exhausted by this effort to discharge
his duty, he retired to a summer-house,
where I observed him regale himself with what had
the appearance of a fruit-ice. The reprimand enforced
with the cane of the white overseer was not
thrown away upon the negro-driver. Before many
minutes were over, he had secured one of the pregnant
women, and threw her on the ground, in a
hollow which he had scraped to allow her belly to
rest, and he thus gave her a flogging with his cartwhip,
while the poor creature's screams rent the air.
I left the spot, and hurried home. As I again surveyed
this scene of cultivation carried to its uttermost

<!-- vol 2 page 199 -->

pitch, all seemed to have changed its aspect
since the morning before, when I had first seen it.
The fruits of negro toil were no longer pleasing
to the eye; all was stained with negro blood:
the canals made me shudder, not admire, for
the skill that planned could not have executed
them without the scourge: I hastened away from
the hamlets that on the day before, the day of
rest, had seemed entirely the abode of the peasantry,
who I then supposed were enjoying under
their shade the Sabbath repose.</p>

<p>"Revolting as the sight of West India slavery
was, so much worse than all of what I saw in Carolina
had led me to expect, I was doomed to witness
horrors yet greater; and only a few days after I
first saw the noble plain of Artibonite. An unusual
stir was observed one morning in the streets of Port-au-Prince:
clerks were seen running to and fro:
signals were making at the pier head of the harbour;
two vessels, one of about two hundred and
the other of three hundred and fifty tons were in
the offing; they were expected from the African
coast; and they arrived to the exceeding great
contentment of the merchants, a satisfaction shared
by the neighbouring planters, and even those who

<!-- vol 2 page 200 -->

had come down from a distance in expectation
of the important event. Not many hours elapsed
before placards were to be seen all over the
place announcing that the cargoes of these two
ships would be exposed for sale early next day
at an African merchant's yard; and every face
in the town seemed radiant with joy. Whatever
gang had been diminished by death through the
maltreatment of the 'stock' (as those human
creatures were termed) could now be completed;
whatever new work remained to be begun, at least
such as newly-imported negroes could be set upon,
might now be commenced, or 'seasoned hands'
might be taken from common labour, their place
being supplied with the raw new comers. The
merchants in the town, the ship-builders and ship-fitters,
who looked to the vessels speedily returning
for fresh importations; the clerks, the planters, their
book-keepers or overseers, the medical practitioners,
the tavern-keepers, all kept the arrival from
'the coast' as a holiday. I was probably the only
person in Port-au-Prince who shared not in the
general joy, that some hundreds of my fellow-creatures
were about to be sold like beasts to the highest
bidder, and worked to death under a tropical

<!-- vol 2 page 201 -->

sun, in tilling: the ground for those most cruel of
task-masters, until the death they desired should
put an end to their sufferings, and give them a welcome
release from their toil.</p>

<p>"I had not remained in Carolina or Virginia
long enough to see a slave-ship, or a sale of her
human cargo: it was, therefore, fit that this sight
should be added to the many which had made me
loathe the agriculture of the Western world. And first
I went on board the smaller vessel. The innkeeper
who accompanied me, and had been once steward of
a slave-ship, pointed out to me the interior economy
of the vessel. I at first did not believe it was
the slaver; and thought we had come to a wrong
ship; for I saw no room, no places for accommodating
two hundred and eighty negroes, the
number she was advertised as having landed, to
say nothing of those who might have died on
the passage. My conductor took me between
decks, and I there perceived a height, in most
places of only eighteen inches, and nowhere above
two feet. In this contracted space above three
hundred human beings had been crammed; they
were chained together by the legs and by the neck,
for the vessel had so small a crew that mutiny was

<!-- vol 2 page 202 -->

apprehended; the supply of water had been so
scanty that many had died of raging fever; and one
morning when thirty of them were brought upon deck
to ventilate the vessel in part (for it was filled with
filth and every pestilential abomination), twelve, arm
in arm, before they could be stopped, had jumped
overboard, grinning horribly at their tormentors,
and shouting that now they must surely go to
nigger-land, as they termed Africa, and be protected
by the good spirit. In all, forty had died or been
drowned. Some of the women had been delivered
while bound in the same tier with sick and dying
men; nay one, whom it drove mad, had actually
brought forth the fruit of the womb while close
touching a slave who had died the day before, but
being chained to one yet living, and the fetters
rivetted, he could not be separated before his body,
in that place, in that climate, became one mass of
putrefaction. These particulars we learnt from a
lad who had then made his first voyage, and was
so haunted with the horrors he had witnessed, that
he determined to leave the ship and beg his bread
rather than return to that terrible charnel-house.
'But,' said my conductor, 'bad as this is, I have
seen worse in my time. Once the ophthalmia broke

<!-- vol 2 page 203 -->

out in a slave-ship, in which I sailed; and thirty-nine
of the miserable negroes became blind; the
inhuman captain, having no chance of selling them,
brought them out on deck, and threw them all overboard.
Above forty still had the disease, and he
allowed them to remain on board, in hopes of a
cure; but they were all landed stone blind.' The
horror which this excited maybe imagined; whereupon
he added that during the war he had himself
seen as wicked an act, and repeatedly seen it.
'When the vessel was chased by an English frigate,
or privateer, the murderous captain would coolly put
as many of his wretched negroes into casks, as he
thought would lighten the ship and enable him to
escape by throwing them into the sea. I have seen
them so thrown without being put in casks; and
devoured immediately by the sharks which ever
attend such vessels in confident expectation of their
prey, from the mortality that constantly reigns on
board slavers.'</p>

<p>"Sick of the sight I had seen, of the pestilential
air that had not yet left the ship, and of the inn-keeper's
relations thus connected with her, I came
on shore and resolved to see the slaves' yard, or
market, the same day, that such horrors might not

<!-- vol 2 page 204 -->

break in upon another. To the advertised place of
sale, then, we went. The negroes were all marked
on the breast or back with a red hot iron; they were
many of them in a sickly state after their dreadful
voyage; but some were pronounced marketable,
and many of those brought by the larger vessel were
of this description. I now saw the same lamentable
sights, but more piteous still, which had harrowed
up my feelings, when I was in the house-slave mart
of Charlestown. The children clinging to their
mothers' neck; the mothers grasping them to their
bosoms; these unhappy creatures embracing the
knees of their purchaser, and beseeching him to
take their infants along with them; the clinging
of those together who had been rivetted during the
voyage to one chain, and thus contracted a friendship
now about to be severed, when loaded with
separate fetters; the various expressions of grief,
of tenderness, of despair, and in some of a rage
which not even the chain and the lash, and the
fever of the passage had been able to quell&mdash;all
presented a picture, extremely sad it is true, but
also very striking. My conductor told me that the
negroes, whose fury I had remarked, were from
the Gold Coast, or Koromantyns; while the less

<!-- vol 2 page 205 -->

deep black, of milder temper, and more subdued
demeanour, were chiefly Eboes. He related the history
of a Koromantyn who had been concerned in a
mutiny, only quelled by the captain firing upon those
engaged, and killing upwards of thirty. The man
was believed to have jumped overboard, as several
did upon the revolt being subdued. But he had
escaped and concealed himself in the hold where
the stowage was dark. He vowed vengeance; and
taking a light was detected when on the point of
rushing into the powder magazine with a candle in
his hand, determined to blow up the ship. The captain
had him secured and brought upon deck; he
prepared instruments of torture; he was giving his
orders to have them applied; the negro, a powerful
man, shook himself loose, rushed overboard, and
was drowned, uttering the most fearful imprecations
against his tyrant. 'But, indeed,' added my guide,
'I have seen equal desperation in a white man. A
Spanish captain, having five hundred slaves on
board, had committed some acts of piracy on his
voyage to Africa; for many slave-ships are fitted
up as pirates, and seize weaker vessels with slave-cargoes
on board, in order to obtain or to complete
their complement cheaper than by bartering on the

<!-- vol 2 page 206 -->

coast. She was chased by an English vessel, and
being sure of punishment for the piracy if taken,
the captain placed a lighted candle over his powder
magazine, and took to his boat with his white crew,
in hopes that the whole vessel, captors, negroes, and
all, might be blown up, as soon as the candle burnt
down to the powder.' I asked what became of the
ship, and he said, that when she was boarded, an
English sailor coolly put his hand under the candle
and brought it away from the powder&mdash;thus saving
the lives of above five hundred persons whom the
monster had doomed to instant destruction.</p>

<p>"When I saw the price paid for these miserable
people, and found that seventy or eighty louis were
given for a 'prime negro,' who probably cost a few
beads in Africa, and was brought over at the cost of
four or five louis, I at once could comprehend how
deep a root this infernal traffic had taken in the minds
of the merchants, both of St. Domingo and of Nantes
and Bordeaux. The same was the case, I found, with
the Spaniards, and Portuguese, and Dutch; with
the English, the traffic was great, but not so extensive,
owing to the smaller extent of uncleared and
fertile land in their colonies. The great demand
for new slaves is, I find, to clear new land, the

<!-- vol 2 page 207 -->

most lucrative speculation to the master, and the
greatest favourite of the whites, while it is at the
same time the employment most fatal to negro life.
The importation into St. Domingo was at this period
immense, greater than it ever had before been, and
in all the intercourse which I had with the people
of that island, and in all my observation of their
slaves, one idea constantly forced itself upon my mind.
How patient soever these negroes may be, however
inferior to their masters in skill and in the power of
combining together, they form the great bulk of the
people. The whites are not here, as I had seen them
on the continent, nearly as numerous as the blacks,
but there are fourteen or fifteen slaves for one free
person. In this state of things, thousands of new
negroes are forced into the colony every year; men
wholly uncivilized, having no kind of local attachment,
still less any feeling of attachment, or even any
habit of submission, to their task-masters. Can such
a state of things exist without the most imminent
hazard of an insurrection, that may carry destruction
over the whole of this noble possession? For one
thing seemed quite clear; to strike a spark might be
difficult, watched as are the slaves; but once struck,
it must needs fall into a heap of matter so combustible

<!-- vol 2 page 208 -->

that an instantaneous explosion is the inevitable result.
Shall I confess it? When I reflected on the
horrors of the market, the field, above all, the
slave-ship, I felt that such a consummation would
seem a just judgment on crimes so enormous; and
that I could reconcile my mind to the catastrophe,
if I believed no other chance existed of extirpating
such horrors, and bringing such sufferings
to a close.</p>

<p>"After I had remained in Port-au-Prince a few
weeks, enjoying the surpassing beauty of the climate
and the scenery, as far as the dreadful taint of negro
slavery would permit any enjoyment, I was invited
by a gentleman in the country, with whom I had
become acquainted on the voyage from New York,
to pass a day or two at his country-house; this I
knew meant at his plantation, for he was an extensive
coffee-planter. The sufferings of the slaves on
such an estate are as nothing compared with what
they undergo in the cultivation of the sugar-cane;
for they are not worked in gangs, and drilled and
dressed in lines under the lash; nor is their toil by
any means severe, the labour of coffee-picking being
more frequently performed by task-work. The repugnance
which I always felt to sugar-planting, I

<!-- vol 2 page 209 -->

own, would have made a visit to a sugar-estate a
season of pain rather than of relaxation.</p>

<p>"I arrived at the house early in the morning, before
the heat had begun, and I found a villa of great
beauty, and even magnificence. The house was fitted
up with every elegance, and the inhabitants seemed
to enjoy all the luxuries and almost all the refinements
of Parisian life. The owner was of a noble
family, long settled in St. Domingo, and, except
sending over his children for education in the mother
country, and transporting his produce for sale at
Nantes, he had little or no intercourse with France.
Among the comforts of a country-house, I did not
observe a library; and there was no chapel, nor any
parish church nearer than the town, which, being
three leagues off, the family seldom went to mass.
'We perform our Easter rites,' (<i>fesons nos p&acirc;ques</i>)
my host said, 'but do not often go to mass, except on
some extraordinary occasion.' I found that his religion
went into nearly as moderate a compass as his
literature. He bore the character of a kind master;
and his negroes rather increased on his old estate;
but he was bringing new land into cultivation for
the cane, on a plantation a league or two distant; and
he complained of the loss of life with which this

<!-- vol 2 page 210 -->

operation was attended. 'An old sugar-plantation,'
he said, 'which we have had for many generations,
costs me only about four or at most five per cent. of
my slaves in the year; but this new land stands me
in twelve or fifteen.' This person who thus coolly
spoke of human life, and set the waste of it on the
debit side of his profit-and-loss account, against the
gross proceeds of his farming speculations, was a man
of kindly disposition, a good father and husband, an
indulgent master to his domestic slaves, a gentleman
of polite, even refined manners, representing an ancient
and honourable family, that had often served
the king with distinction; he had been educated in
Europe, and brought up among the first circles of
its most polished capital. Could I wonder that
habit, the sight of human suffering, prolonged
till it becomes an usual occurrence and blunts the
feelings, the sight of human crimes exhibited till
it ceases to shock, and then hardens the heart,
producing so great a havoc in a character such as
this, should cause a far more dreadful havoc in
men of other natures, and other education? Could
I wonder that it should finally lead to the desperate
and hateful excesses which reign in the slave-market
and the slave-ship?</p>

<!-- vol 2 page 211 -->

<p>"In the course of my walks among the richly-cultivated
grounds, and in the fine scenery that surrounded
the villa, I had occasion to see and converse
with some of the slaves, and one, who presented a
very striking appearance, greatly engaged my attention.
He was a tall, finely-formed person, somewhat
under the middle age, born in the island,
indeed on the estate, but of parents who had been
brought from Africa. His hue was a deep black of
extraordinary lustre; his features expressive, though
having the negro contour of thick lips and flat nose;
his eye singularly animated, his voice strong and
shrill. Nothing could be more active or graceful
than all his motions, nothing more quick and lively
than his apprehension. Wholly destitute of all education,
he had yet conversed much with his fellow-slaves,
and much also with the new comers, if by
that name we may designate those who are by force
or fraud brought across the ocean from the Old
World to augment the mass of their kindred's
wretchedness in the New. With these he had delighted
to talk; he took a pleasure in hearing of
their cruel sufferings&mdash;of their sorrow at being torn
from their peaceful homes and their innocent pursuits&mdash;of
their agonies at after-separations in the

<!-- vol 2 page 212 -->

slave-market&mdash;of their usage when first broke in to
the toils of West Indian husbandry. In these images
he had a singular pleasure individually; to recount
them gave him boundless gratification; he loved to
converse with me because I showed my sympathy
with his race, and would listen for an hour together
while he repeated to me what he had heard of the
negro-man's wrongs&mdash;more hard to bear than any
he had himself to endure. His own mother, he said,
was the daughter of a chief, inveigled by a native
slave-dealer, and kidnapped at the age of sixteen;
his father had been captured in an expedition undertaken
expressly to obtain a cargo for a French slave-ship,
which had unexpectedly come upon the coast
when there were no slaves in the factory. At home
both the one and the other used to be waited upon
by slaves of their father's household; and neither
had ever known what distress, much less work, least
of all the scourge, was, until the horrid slave-ship
made them familiar with wretchedness and fetters,
and the driver's whip taught them to toil. While
he himself was yet a child, and the comfort of their
lives, they had been sold to a planter living far away,
near Cape Fran&ccedil;ois; his mother had broken her
heart at the separation, and his father had before her

<!-- vol 2 page 213 -->

death been compelled, owing to the fineness of his
person, to marry or cohabit with another woman for
a breed. 'My solace,' said the Koromantyn negro,
'is to think of my mother's grave and my father's
degradation! It refreshes my soul to drink in at
these inexhaustible sources the sweet waters of a revenge
that never can sleep until I too slumber in the
grave. It is a new, and varied, and never-ending
refreshment to quaff the same cup of vengeance from
the hands of the sufferers who have just landed from
the slave-ships. The white glutton is less insatiable
in the masses which he devours; the pampered white
epicure is less choice in the delicacies he culls to tickle
his palate; the white drunkard is less assiduous in
applying provocatives to stimulate his jaded appetite
and excite an artificial thirst,&mdash;than I to glut myself
with new horrors committed by the execrable
race upon my harmless and hapless kinsmen! My
sympathy with the sufferer is lost in my hatred of
his tormentors; I grudge him not all he endures,
so it adds fuel to the fire of my revenge, and makes
it to burn more fierce. And, oh! if there be a God
above, surely he will reward my long suffering with
an opportunity of satisfying this craving thirst for
the blood of the fiends whose pale, sickly aspect, can

<!-- vol 2 page 214 -->

only inspire disgust in all beholders, as their cruelty
spreads horror over all that witness or hear it!'&mdash;As
he spoke his eyes seemed to glare with fire; his face
was distorted with rage; his mouth showed snow-white
teeth that seemed to grind as he uttered his fiery
exclamation; he grasped a huge club in his hand,
and, as in a paroxysm which he had lost all power
to control, he dashed it wildly and fiercely upon a
white stucco figure placed in the grass walk where
we were standing, nor could stay his hand until he
had shivered it to atoms.&mdash;'And now I know full
well,' said he, 'that I have by this act of mutiny
forfeited this hateful and worthless life! But not
hateful shall my death be, nor yet worthless, if I
can sound the trumpet of just, of holy rebellion,
and rouse my countrymen to assert their freedom,
and call them to join with me in slaking, or endeavouring
to slake, our burning, our unquenchable
thirst of Christian blood!'</p>

<p>"I felt deeply alarmed at the extremity to which
this conversation had gone. I besought the Koromantyn
to calm himself; I assured him I would
take upon myself the destruction of the figure; and
I prevailed upon him to walk quietly away, and leave
the rest to me. But the scene made a deep impression

<!-- vol 2 page 215 -->

upon my mind, and I plainly saw that the negroes
would not want either instigators or leaders,
if ever a time should come when the impossibility
of longer endurance prepared them for a great
revolt.</p>

<p>"But before long I had an opportunity of seeing
that followers would be no more wanting than leaders
in the work of destruction should an opportunity be
afforded for taking their revenge. I had accompanied
my former guide, the innkeeper, to the town
of Cape Fran&ccedil;ois, in the north of the island; and
we went to see the beautiful cultivation of that vast
and fertile plain in its immediate neighbourhood. It
even exceeds that of Artibonite, near Port-au-Prince,
in wealth of every kind. The plantation which
chiefly arrested my attention was that of M. Gallifet,
the most extensive and valuable of the whole district,
and situated about three leagues from Cape Town.
The owner is of the noble and much respected
family of Gallifet, near Aix, in Provence; the
management of this fine property has generally
been excellent, humane as well as skilful; and the
treatment of the negroes so kind, that it was a proverb
in St. Domingo, 'as happy as one of Gallifet's
negroes' (<i>heureux comme un negre de Gallifet</i>)

<!-- vol 2 page 216 -->

when any person wanted to describe the comfortable
circumstances of one of the humbler class of whites.
Some years, however, before my arrival, the manager
had been changed; a contrary system had
been introduced; the numbers of the slaves were no
longer kept up by breeding; the loss of hands
had to be supplied from the slave-market; and, as
always happens in such cases of change, the contrast
between the present and the former condition of the
poor negroes made their treatment the more felt
and their discontent the greater, although very
possibly they were not worse off than their fellow
labourers in the other plantations.</p>

<p>"In the evening of the day on which we visited the
place, a threatening aspect of the sky gave warning
of a storm, which an old negro had foretold several
hours before, with the sure instinct that never fails
the blacks respecting changes in the weather. We
perceived huge masses of cloud, soaring up aloft in
a distant part of the sky, assuming fantastic shapes,
sometimes rent asunder and sometimes tumbled together,
but tinged with a dull light of a red or copper
colour. The sun had set in the same hue and
having a larger appearance than usual; the hill tops
looked blue and clear, and seemed as if close by;

<!-- vol 2 page 217 -->

when the moon appeared, her colour was as of blood;
and each star partook of the same tint, having also
a halo round it like the greater light. The air was
dead calm; but in its upper regions the restless and
capricious movements of the clouds indicated various
currents afloat. Not a note could now be heard from
any bird; the cooing of the wood-pigeon was hushed,
and even the humming of the enamel-beetle had
ceased. All the domestic animals about the negro
huts seemed to await in mute suspense the commencement
of the elemental strife, now on the eve of
being engaged. We shared in this prevalent feeling;
and at length heard distant peals of thunder, echoed
among the surrounding mountains. Suddenly it
seemed close upon us, and a tremendous clap,
preceded but an instant by vivid forked lightning,
seemed to break hard by. The conch or gong now
sounded the signal that calls the slaves to work; it
was the alarm given by the superintendent. The
negroes all left their huts, as if dreading these might
not be safe under the fury of the tempest. Still there
was no wind, no rain&mdash;not a breath, not a drop;
but endless flashes of fire lit up the firmament, and
the roaring of the sea at times drowned that of the
thunder. I heard the negroes speaking low to one

<!-- vol 2 page 218 -->

another, but as if watching the storm with extreme
interest.&mdash;'Why should we be called? We cannot
help the master if his house is shaken.'&mdash;'No,' said
another, 'but if our huts fall while his is shaken,
we may be killed, and so he might lose his slaves.'
Suddenly I saw them all pointing to one spot, and I
observed a whole cane-place, house, trees, and all,
whirled up in the air, the sugar-mill destroyed, and
numbers of huts levelled with the ground. A chorus
of triumph instantly burst from the negroes, as they
beheld this havoc of the hurricane, and feasted their
eyes on the ruin of their master's hopes. 'No
sugar this year, thank God,' said one.&mdash;'No coffee,
neither,' answered another, 'for the high grounds
are swept as bare as the plain.'&mdash;'But,' said an old
negress, 'our own provision-grounds are destroyed.
What shall we do?'&mdash;'Hurrah!' said a Koromantyn
youth close by. 'What shall we do? Why laugh
to see the white man weep, and look more hideous
with his pale leprosy face than ever!'&mdash;'I have no
more any cottage to shelter me,' said an old female,
as the rain began to descend in torrents, more like a
river than a shower.&mdash;'I, too, have none,' answered
a woman near her. 'But I have no longer a child
to keep dry and warm; they took my boy away

<!-- vol 2 page 219 -->

from me; they drove my husband to another district;
let the weather fall on me as it pleases; if I
can but see that great house, as ugly white as its
owner, torn down by the tempest, I care not what
becomes of my poor hut.'&mdash;'Saw you the lightning
strike the chimney?' said the Koromantyn. 'There
is smoke! God for his mercy be praised! There
is smoke!&mdash;Ah! no, no&mdash;the rain has put out the
fire. Oh, fetch me a pitch-ball and some flax that
is dry; I will steal to the house in the dark, and
see if the fire of the lightning may not be kindled
anew.'</p>

<p>"But at this moment an alarm was spread that the
white driver had fallen into a river swollen by the
rain to a torrent, and the superintendent ran about
for help to him, ordering all who could dive or
swim to assist. Many ran, but slowly; none would
bestir themselves; they saw the wretched man
struggling with the flood; he cast a piteous look,
discernable every other minute in the gleams of the
lightning and sometimes by the torch-light; but no
helping hand was stretched out, and he was carried
down towards the wheels of the mill, where the
flood-gate, a large fragment of which was left standing,
stopped his now lifeless body; and it was taken

<!-- vol 2 page 220 -->

out with sufficient alacrity by the negroes, their eyes
glaring, and the whole countenance expressive of
perfect, delight. This was the end of the under-manager,
who had been employed for several years
in executing the new plans, since the manager of
the plantation was changed, and with the manager
the system of kindly treatment."</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p class="small">THE WEST INDIES.&mdash;SLAVE OWNERS.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The</span> reflections to which this scene gave rise,
were calculated to fill the mind with gloomy forebodings.
I could easily perceive how rotten all the
foundations were on which so noble a structure of
wealth in this fine colony had been reared. If the
Creole or home-born negroes seemed thus animated
with such inextinguishable hatred towards their
masters, what might be expected from those newly
imported, of whom above thirty thousand yearly
were introduced among the old and seasoned slaves?
After remaining a few days at the Cape, we returned
to Port-au-Prince; and I soon had an opportunity
of visiting the largest of all the islands, in company
with a Catholic priest, who was going upon the
business of his bishop to the Havanna.</p>

<p>"The trade wind favours this voyage; and though

<!-- vol 2 page 222 -->

the distance is nearly two hundred and fifty leagues,
we arrived in little more than a week from the day we
left Gonaives Bay. I was exceedingly struck with
the magnificence of this noble city, by far the finest,
as I take it, in the New World, and which bears
quite the appearance in all respects of the great towns
in the Old. The deep spacious harbour, where whole
fleets may find shelter secure under the protection
of the two strong forts at its entrance; the ample
quays; the streets, narrow indeed in the town, wide
in the suburbs, of houses many of which resemble
the palaces of our European nobles; the numberless
churches crowned with towers and spires; the great
places for public resort; the convents, the University,
the theatres; the splendid equipages of the inhabitants;
the appearance of the well-appointed troops;
above every thing the vast proportion of whites,
exceeding considerably that of the slave population;
all brings to mind the other side of the Atlantic;
indeed it seemed the only part of America which was
not of yesterday in its whole form and aspect. The
Spaniards of the West Indies, too, are somewhat
more hospitable than those of the Peninsula; I was
introduced by the priest to several of their houses,
and I found the magnificence of their style of living&mdash;their

<!-- vol 2 page 223 -->

plate, their table, their servants,&mdash;all on the scale
of the wealthiest European grandees.</p>

<p>"The warm praise lavished on these Spaniards by
my reverend fellow-traveller prepared me to expect
a most Catholic generation. In no place have I
ever seen the observances of the Romish Church so
much made the business of men's lives. The endless
recurrence of mere ceremonial matters appears
to fill up the whole day; while the bells of the
churches never cease to toll, nor the chant to rise,
nor the procession to darken the street. The priests
are numerous, as might be expected; but that
strife is not banished by raising images, telling
beads, saying masses, and signing crosses, may
be gathered from the countless legions of lawyers
who swarm in the town, four times more than in
St. Domingo, compared with the number of the
people.</p>

<p>"In the hands of the priests, however, is the whole
education, if such it can be called, of the upper
classes, who alone have anything that can be designated
by such a name; and the influence of the
same order of men is unbounded in private families.
The ignorance of the community, even of those in
the better condition of life, exceeds anything I could

<!-- vol 2 page 224 -->

have conceived possible in our days: it seems as if,
like the inhabitants of the East, they had stood stock
still, and knew no more than their ancestors who
first settled in America three centuries ago.</p>

<p>"The character of the people is partly influenced
by their extreme ignorance; but partly, too, by the
two inherent vices of the Spanish nature&mdash;the love
of inactive ease, and pride, hardening the heart to
humane feelings and opening it to cruel passions.
The Cuba planter, even, is a lazy, a listless being;
he leaves to the hands of hired agents the care of
his fortune and of his slaves, neither exerting himself
to prevent the mismanagement of the one, nor
to check the maltreatment of the other. With one
branch of West Indian industry, indeed, his religious
feelings interfere&mdash;he will have no direct concern in
the slave-traffic. But then the whispers of piety
and conscience combined are easily drowned in the
louder accents of avarice; he quietly buys the
slaves which others have imported, and he works
them to death under the merciless cart-whip, in the
burning sun, among the pestilential marshes of this
great island. The Spanish planter, however, in one
respect differs from the English, the Dutch, and even
the French; the strict temperance of the Castilian

<!-- vol 2 page 225 -->

character is maintained in its tropical variety: the
indulgence, and even loose habits, prevailing among
the other European settlers are in like manner unknown.
Most of the proprietors reside in the island.
Indeed no very great number of absentees are to be
found in the French colonies, especially in St. Domingo.
A far larger proportion of the property, in
both the English and the Dutch settlements, is owned
by persons who never see their estates, and leave all
to their managers, without any control or superintendence.
The sad and inevitable consequences
of this, upon the treatment of the poor slaves, are
apparent; but the Cuba negroes gain much less than
might be expected from their master's residence in
the colony; he hardly pays any attention to his
concerns, and leaves the overseer almost as uncontrolled
as if he lived in Cadiz or Madrid. Nor
must we forget the cruel disposition shown by the
Spaniards in their treatment of the native Indians,
millions of whom were sacrificed to the Spanish lust
of gold. They who invented the African slave-trade
to mitigate the lot of their Indian serfs, are not very
likely now to treat the black men more mercifully
than they once did the brown.</p>

<p>"I was travelling in a wood some two days'

<!-- vol 2 page 226 -->

journey from the Havanna, when I heard the baying
of hounds. The sound was loud, and fell heavily
upon the ear; it directed my steps to the quarter
whence it seemed to proceed. I soon perceived two
hounds of a strange appearance; they were of extraordinary
strength, and had a look of singular
ferocity, so much so that I prepared to defend
myself, and presented a staff to keep them off. My
companion, a person living in the neighbourhood,
and who had come to show me the way, desired me
to stand aside behind a large mahogany-tree close
by, and assured me that the dogs would not touch
us. 'They are blood-hounds,' said he, 'and are
trained to hunt down the runaway negroes. A white
man they will always let alone.' I found they were
followed at some distance by the overseer of an
estate a good way off; and I joined him in following
them, for I soon found that the dogs were not merely
exercising, but were in their horrid quest of human
game. After half-an-hour's chase we came to an
opening, which they coasted half round, going by the
scent, and soon burying themselves in the thicket.
But I thought I perceived on the opposite side to
that where they had been before they disappeared,
some large body moving among the trees. Could

<!-- vol 2 page 227 -->

it be a fugitive negro? I ran across the open space
in hopes of being able to rescue the miserable man,
if it were one; I presently saw that it was a negro,
as I had supposed; he was crouching behind a
projecting fragment of rock on the other side of a
small brook, which he appeared to have passed,
probably conceiving that the scent would be interrupted
by the stream. His face was convulsed with
terror, but his eye glared at the same time, as he
anxiously listened to the distant baying of the
hounds. My companion cautioned me against
taking any part, or even seeming to encourage the
slave's escape, the heaviest penalties being denounced
against all such interference, which is regarded as
abetting a kind of treason&mdash;the treason most reprobated
in the West Indies, that against the superior
authority of the master or man-owner. The poor
creature continued fixed to the spot, and I was in
hopes that, the river having cut off the means of
tracing him, the hounds had gone away; when
suddenly the dreadful sound again opened, and,
with an approaching, became an unceasing loudness.
No chance remained but the water interposed between
the ferocious animals and their prey. Soon
they came up baying more keenly than before; they

<!-- vol 2 page 228 -->

approached the stream; the huntsman followed close,
but saw not the negro, else he would have probably
interfered to save his master's property, however
careless he might have been of his fellow-creature's
life. One of the hounds came to the water's edge,
the other skirted the wood. The Spaniard hallooed
him across a few steps above; and to my unutterable
horror I saw the savage animal, though not more
fierce than the huntsman, rush fiercely upon the
negro, throttle him with his teeth, and in an instant
stretch him dead on the spot, weltering in his gore.
The huntsman came up too late to save the planter's
purse, the only loss that vexed him; and when I
expressed my horror at this melancholy catastrophe,
'Yes, indeed,' said the high-minded and devout
Castilian, 'yes, indeed! Oh, Holy Virgin and St.
Jago, protect me! this is a sad loss! How dare I
face my master or his manager? The negro was well
worth two hundred and fifty dollars. A dreadful
thing to think of so much money sunk in the sea!'&mdash;I
confess that, after all I had seen of the West
Indian character, and of negro-slavery, this scene
made a deeper impression on me, and shocked
me more severely, than any thing I had before
witnessed. Nothing had ever brought so home to

<!-- vol 2 page 229 -->

my mind the entire perversion of all human feelings,
which suffering man to hold man in possession as
property is inevitably fitted to produce.</p>

<p>"I found that these cruel Spaniards not only used
their blood-hounds for hunting down their own runaway
slaves, but hired them out to the planters of
the other islands for the same purpose. As many
as forty and fifty huntsmen have been known to be
hired, with their hounds, ninety or a hundred in
number, to perform this work, when a great body of
negroes in any island has taken flight, and established
themselves in the woods. And it was no
novelty with the Spaniards thus to hunt their fellow-creatures
for the lucre of gain. Many original
settlers in South America, those men whom sordid
avarice prompted thus to acts of cruelty wholly
without a parallel in the history of the most blood-thirsty
of savage tribes, chased and massacred the
unhappy Indians by packs of blood-hounds. It
was the remains of this breed that I saw employed
by the descendants of those Spaniards, when I
visited Cuba.</p>

<p>"During this excursion into the interior of the
island, I chanced to see the negro character in a
perfectly new position. There are far more whites

<!-- vol 2 page 230 -->

in proportion to blacks in the Havanna than in any
other town of the West Indies; but there are also
far more free people of colour in that than in any
other place which I have seen. Some of them have
acquired property to a considerable amount; and
with one of these, Don Francesco Moreno, I made
acquaintance, through the priest, who knew his confessor.
I found him an agreeable and well-informed
man. I saw him once or twice when he came to
wait upon the Governor, during my stay at the
Havanna, and I accepted his invitation to visit his
plantation near the high land, when I went up the
country. It was a singular, and to me a most gratifying
sight to see this worthy man, living in all
the refinement of civilized society, with its tastes and
its habits as familiar to him as to one of our own
race, surrounded by an amiable and accomplished
family, and exercising a liberal hospitality to persons
of all ranks, who favoured him with their company.
I had found no Spaniard in the Havanna so well
informed as this excellent negro, certainly none
whose manners so much pleased me; for he had all
the dignity of the Spanish decorum, without any of
its over-done stateliness, or exaggerated self-importance.
His conversation, too, was agreeable and

<!-- vol 2 page 231 -->

racy; for he never at any time forgot his origin, nor
lowered the dignity of his race by needless compliances;
and occasionally, forgetting with whom he
was conversing, he would rather think aloud the
thoughts that might naturally correspond with his
own prejudices, than adapt himself very nicely to
ours.</p>

<p>"Talking at table after dinner, of liberality, national
feeling, and the narrow-mindedness these so
often engender, he said, 'For my own part, I cannot
enter into such notions at all. If I find a man well-conditioned,
honourable in his conduct, and correct
in his behaviour, I can hold out my hand to him as a
friend, though he be as white as that table-cloth.'&mdash;This
remark he saw made me smile, and that led to
some discussion upon the difference of the races.
'Shall we never,' said I, 'live to see our inveterate
prejudice against mixing the breeds by intermarriage,
wear away among us?'&mdash;'I hardly expect it,'
he answered; 'there would be probably little difficulty
on your parts, for obvious reasons. But I can
scarcely think that any length of time or closeness
of intercourse will ever get over our very strong
feeling of aversion to the unnatural white colour of
the European skin; to say nothing of the lank, ungraceful

<!-- vol 2 page 232 -->

hair, of various grotesque colours, even
before gluttony and drunkenness and all other kinds
of indulgence have made it as white as the skin it
covers. Besides, one not only feels the colour, and
necessarily feels it, as a hideous deformity, but the
idea of it is invariably connected with that of
disease. I should as soon think of throwing my
arms around the neck of a leper, as one of your
fair countrywomen.'&mdash;I asked him 'had he ever
seen the Marchesa Grua, the great beauty of the
Havanna,&mdash;for surely there was warmth enough in
her complexion, which was even bordering upon
darkish.'&mdash;'Why yes,' he said, 'and if she had
not that frightful brown hair, she might approach
to a mulatto beauty; a pale, plain, and diseased
mulatto, however; and, observe, I don't admit the
possibility of mulatto beauty, though it is of a
hue less disgusting than the white. But,' added
he, 'I once bought a miniature of your other
Havanna beauty, Condesa Calderon, who is frightful
white itself; I took it home as a curiosity
to show my family what Spaniards admire; and it
was used for some time in the house as a monster to
frighten the young children when they cried.' His
family had no intercourse with the city; his lady

<!-- vol 2 page 233 -->

Donna Isabella alone had ever been there; and
being a well-educated and accomplished person,
herself superintended the education of her only remaining
daughter, as Don Francesco did that of his
two boys. I observed that these children were well
brought up, and could easily conceal any feelings
which my appearance had a tendency to excite; all
but the youngest boy, who ran away on my entering
the room, and raised a cry as if he had seen some
hideous wild animal. His mamma excused him by
saying that this was the first time they had been
favoured with the company of a European, except
on one occasion when the Governor passed through,
and then the children were all gone to bed.</p>

<p>"On many points, even of some delicacy, my
worthy host conversed with me freely enough in the
course of the evening, during the intervals of Donna
Isabella and the young lady playing and singing,
and of an old negro actor and a younger one
amusing us with their African airs and droll buffooneries.
I found, however, that any approach to
one subject was extremely painful to him. The
subjection of slaves to black masters he quite understood,
and his own plantation was worked by a sable
peasantry, all in servitude, though treated like domestics

<!-- vol 2 page 234 -->

rather than slaves. This seemed to him
quite in the natural order of things; as long as his
countrymen would not labour for hire, and while
some were rich and others poor, no other arrangement
could grow out of the circumstances of society. But
nothing could reconcile his mind to a white being
the owner, and master, and tyrant of blacks. He
admitted the great superiority of our race in knowledge,
in wealth, and in cultivation; but still it
seemed like a subversion of the fundamental laws of
nature that our 'pale, miserable figures should be
seen domineering over the children of the sun, rejoicing
in their indomitable strength, their boundless
activity, and glowing with all the luxuriant warmth
of their splendid beauty.' He seemed to think it
like the lower animals holding man in subjection.
'But this,' he said, 'is by very far too unnatural
a state of things to last. That it has endured so long
seems wholly inexplicable. Every hour now brings
it nearer its close. That close is hastened by the
insane measures of the whites, above all by their
wicked prosecution of the African traffic. Depend
upon it we shall ere long see the fruits of this
accursed tree gathered by our black people, who
must, and will, and shall, regain the mastery,

<!-- vol 2 page 235 -->

and either exterminate the whites, or subdue
them.'</p>

<p>"I did not on this occasion thwart my worthy friend,
by keeping up the argument, which I must have
done had I continued the conversation. But he afterwards
mentioned a circumstance to illustrate the deep
feelings with which the negroes, especially of the
French colonies, cherish their remembrance of
oppression and degradation. A friend of his in
St. Domingo now free, having been enabled to purchase
his liberty by an accidental bequest of money,
had thriven in the world, and become a considerable
proprietor of coffee-grounds. 'I sometimes go to
pay him a visit,' said Don Francesco, 'and he lives
in comfort, and even in the elegance of civilized society,
having a house in Cape Fran&ccedil;ois, from which his
coffee-plantation is somewhat distant. But I always
find that he retains possession of two trinkets, lodged
in a box, which he keeps as carefully as any of our
ladies do their jewel-caskets&mdash;an iron once round his
wrist as a fetter on some apprehended disobedience
and mutiny, and a lash with which he had once been
scourged, and which he afterwards secured and secreted.
Sometimes when we are canvassing confidentially
the prospects of our noble but unhappy race, he will

<!-- vol 2 page 236 -->

bring out this casket and draw forth these precious
relics, the emblems of his former sufferings. When
he views them his eyes sparkle, his teeth gnash; it
is easy to see that his imagination is on fire, that he
is intoxicating himself with the sweets of anticipated
revenge upon the cruel oppressors of his kindred.'</p>

<p>"My curiosity was powerfully excited by these conversations,
and by what I had myself seen in St. Domingo.
I made many inquiries touching the negro
people. My excellent host said that he could enable
me to see them in peculiar circumstances, as he had
the means of taking me to some of their midnight
orgies, where, having no fear of the driver's lash, or
the overseer's superintendence, they give a loose to
their naturally gay temper, spending the night in
sports, as they have been compelled to pass the day
in toil; but also, he said, their naturally superstitious
habits break out on the same occasion, and the turns
of their affrighted and bewildered imaginations frequently
have as free a scope as their mirthful disposition.
It was agreed that we should repair to
one of those resorts; and we chose the estate of a
white planter, whose negroes were known to my
friend, and would, from their confidence in him, let
us be present, not only at their dances, but at their

<!-- vol 2 page 237 -->

more gloomy mysteries. About eleven at night we
arrived among them, and the first hour was passed
in all the frolics of African humour, grotesque dances,
extravagant, but not bad acting, ludicrous buffoonery,
music, sometimes plaintive, more frequently noisy.
Twelve o'clock came; and a body of them, not very
numerous, collected itself together and retired to a
cave, whither we followed. Two huge sacks were
produced, and a third of lesser size. Instantly the
contents of the larger ones were discharged, and the
negroes, as if by a single movement, paved the cave
with human skulls, hard, dry, and bleached white.
In another minute the walls were hung with bloody
skulls and bloody jaw-bones, all as if the life had
been recently taken. The horrid mysteries of
Obi were now performed, to a dismal, drawling air,
which all present, but our two selves, bore their part
in chaunting. The skulls of three cats were then laid
upon a board in the centre of the cavern; the beak
of a bird, and a tiger's tooth, as an old negro explained
to us, were laid close by the skulls, with a
plantain leaf, on which he said grave-dust was spread.
These, we were told, were fetiches or charms. The
Fetisser or priest now muttered over the board certain
incantations, which, we were told, consisted of prayers

<!-- vol 2 page 238 -->

to a large serpent; and then it was produced, stuffed,
of hideous size, and was addressed as the 'grandfather
of snakes.' I asked if these were not Christians.
'No, no,' said my friend, 'not one of them. Outwardly
they conform, and pretend to be converted;
but their horror of a religion whose votaries make
the misery of their lives is in exact proportion
to their abhorrence of its professors, and I firmly
believe that a Catholic priest's life would not be safe
in this cavern, though they might have confessed to
him, or pretended to confess, the week or the day
before. I wish we may not before we leave this
spot see samples of their feelings towards the Christians
and the whites. Thus, I know that such of
them as are redeemed from the most degrading of
their African superstitions, and no longer worship
serpents, have a black idol as the good spirit, and a
white as the evil one.'</p>

<p>"He had hardly spoken when I saw two negroes
bring in a small figure, seemingly of wax, representing
a man reclining on a bed. The Fetisser
took it up in his arms, and approached it to the
small fire, which had been lit in one corner of the
cave.&mdash;'Burn thee! melt thee! end thee! curse
thee!'&mdash;he said or sung, as he gradually roasted and

<!-- vol 2 page 239 -->

melted and consumed each limb.&mdash;'This,' said the
old negro, who had instructed us, 'this is our overseer's
figure, and Obi is laid for him. He cannot
escape.'&mdash;Don Francesco told me that every negro
believes implicitly in the omnipotence of the Obi
charms, and that as soon as it is known that Obi is
laid for any one of them by the procurement of an
enemy, or from jealousy, or to detect any offence, he
gives himself up for lost, never doubts of his fate, and,
unless his spirit is of an undaunted nature, pines away
and dies. Instances had been known of one plantation
losing as many as a hundred negroes in the course of
a few years from the incantations of an old Fetisser,
or Obi man. The laws of most colonies forbid these
practices under even important penalties, and when
this man was discovered and banished the island, the
negroes regained their cheerfulness as if by miracle.
But these men whom we now saw at their incantations
implicitly believed in the fate of the overseer
being now sealed; 'and indeed,' added my friend,
'if the consummation of the sorcery be long delayed,
I fear means will not be wanting to the Fetisser of
accomplishing his own predictions; the overseer
will be found poisoned in his bed.'</p>

<p>"This operation of roasting apparently formed the

<!-- vol 2 page 240 -->

main business of the night, But a more horrid sight
was presented to the eye than the melting of an
image. A procession moved through the cavern,
headed by a standard-bearer, and the standard
was the body of an infant, at least the image
of an infant's body, impaled on a long spear.
While they moved through the cave, an alarm-bell
was heard to toll, as if to give warning of
some fire, and this implied a muster of negroes on
the estate, perhaps a visitation of their haunts. In
less time than it had taken to lay them down, the
skulls were taken up, and, with the bloody bones on
the wall, were conveyed to the sacks, which with the
fetiche board were buried in a deep recess of the
cave; the fire was put out; the cavern was deserted;
and all the negroes were again dancing and singing
and acting on the open space near the concealed
recess. It proved to be a false alarm of fire; and I
accompanied my friend and host, to his house, deeply
impressed with the marked abhorrence of his white
oppressors, and the fixed determination to have his
revenge on them, which fills the mind of the negro,
and bursts forth as often as an occasion is found of
indulging it with safety. The words of Don Francesco,
also, recurred to my mind, when, in discussing

<!-- vol 2 page 241 -->

the subject he exclaimed, 'Ere long our
black people must, and will, and shall regain
the mastery, and exterminate the whites or subdue
them.' "</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="small">PROGRESS OF REVOLUTION.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span> had reached, apparently, the latest period
of his singular history; but he had still more to relate
than the time would now permit; and after some
conversation, which naturally arose out of the picture
he had presented to his young friend of West Indian
society, they separated with the design of again
meeting in a few days, and then finishing the long
narrative.</p>

<p>"How is it in human nature," said the Count before
he took his departure, "to witness, aye, or even
to hear of such things&mdash;of the slave-mart, the slave-cargo,
the accursed African ship&mdash;and not join in
the natural expression, though of frightful rage, which
you witnessed in the hurricane near Cape Fran&ccedil;ois?

<!-- vol 3 page 2 -->

My blood alternately curdles and boils when I think
of the cruelties inflicted on that unhappy race; and
I feel as if nothing could grieve me less than some
convulsion of society which should at once snap
their chains."&mdash;"Yes," said Albert, "the feeling
may be natural, but it is also very unreflecting.
Such a convulsion would be a frightful explosion, as
fatal to the one colour as to the other. The whites
would be overpowered by the vast numbers of the
negroes; but these are ill-fitted for self-government;
their very wrongs, the state they have been kept in,
their habitual subjection, unfits them for enjoying
freedom; and a scene of deplorable anarchy must
succeed their violent emancipation and their extirpation
of the whites."&mdash;"Still," said the Count,
"it is difficult to think of the slave-ship, and the
blood-hound, and the cart-whip, and not say Welcome
any event that can end such horrors."&mdash;"As it might
be natural," said Albert, "and yet would be very
unreasonable, to wish for an earthquake which should
destroy, or a deluge which should swallow up the
islands, exterminating the suffering slaves with their
oppressive masters. Mark well," he continued, "if
I am averse to such violence, it is for the sake of the
injured sufferers, not of the guilty wrong-doers. As

<!-- vol 3 page 3 -->

far as they are concerned, my feelings, even my principles,
go along with you."&mdash;"But the same thing,"
said Chatillon, "cannot be said of the Continent; of
Virginia and Carolina, for example, where the same
disproportion exists not between the two races, which
makes any violent emancipation to be dreaded in the
islands. Surely, if these Republicans who so shamefully,
even against their most sacred principles,
persist in holding a million of their fellow-creatures
in chains, no feeling of compassion nor any notions
of expediency should prevent us from desiring to see
the catastrophe which must sooner or later result
from their blind perseverance in the present wicked
system. If all the slaves, leaving the whites alone,
were to assert their freedom, and secure only as much
of the land as would suffice for their support, who
could either blame them, or pity their cruel masters?"&mdash;"I
own," said Albert, "that my sentiments
do not differ widely from yours on this great matter.
But one thing I will say,&mdash;should the Americans
show a proper sense of justice and of consistency,
by not only stopping the importation of slaves
(this they must do for their own safety), but by
framing measures which may pave the way for
liberating those now in their country, I should not

<!-- vol 3 page 4 -->

be very anxious to hurry forward the moment
of emancipation. I should be satisfied if I saw
steps taken with decision for preparing to bring
about, within a reasonable time, that happy consummation."</p>

<p>Chatillon found on leaving the hidden apartment,
and returning to the inhabited rooms, that he had
stayed so long as to leave him little time for seeing his
friends before dinner was announced. He saw all
present in a state of silent alarm, the arrival of Ernest
Deverell from Nismes having brought intelligence
of serious disturbances broken out in Dauphin&eacute;.
The riots were said to have been most formidable at
Grenoble, where the Governor, the Duke de Tonn&egrave;re,
had been forced to save his life by giving up the
keys of the garrison to the insurgents, and these had
broken into his house and pillaged his fine cabinet.
Accounts had also been received of riots at Rennes
in Britany. There had been other disturbances in
different places. Some of the company assembled
at the Ch&acirc;teau were of opinion that these excesses
might prove beneficial by rousing the government
to put forth its strength. "No one," said M. La
Croasse, "can for a moment doubt what would be
the result of so unequal a conflict." It was, however,

<!-- vol 3 page 5 -->

observed by Ernest, who had seen the Governor
of Nismes, that a most alarming symptom had in
one or two instances been lately exhibited; the
military were with difficulty prevailed upon to act,
and in one case had positively refused to take part
against their fellow-citizens. This was in part
ascribed to the troops having been engaged in the
American war, but probably without ground. It
was, however, quite certain that many of the officers,
some of them men of rank, who served in the contest
with the Republicans, had brought back high
notions of liberty, which they were not slow to promulgate,
with a pretty strong expression of hatred
to arbitrary power. La Croasse himself could not
deny that this formed a most alarming part of the
case; but he still maintained that the sound part of
the army, if used with vigour, would be sufficient to
prevent further mischief, and above all to ward off
the greatest of evils and of dangers too, he said, the
making what concessions you may admit, and what
concessions are in themselves just, to the violence of
the lawless mob. "To them," said he, "nothing&mdash;to
justice, and reason, and kindness, everything&mdash;should
be the maxim; and in order to have a shelter
behind which you can exercise this wise policy, begin

<!-- vol 3 page 6 -->

by putting down tumult, with a strong, that is an
armed hand. After that, as much concession as you
please, and as is right."</p>

<p>An event had happened shortly before these disturbances,
which was considered of importance at
the time, and still more on reflecting upon it afterwards.
The Parliament, echoing the remonstrances
of their brethren at Grenoble, had inveighed loudly
against <i>lettres de cachet</i>, and called for the entire
abolition of the power to issue them. The Queen
and her party, seconded by the Count d'Artois, took
this opportunity to press upon the King the necessity
of violent measures; he had accordingly required
the surrender of two obnoxious members, MM.
Epresmenil and Monsambert. To enforce his demand,
he surrounded the House with a body of
troops, and the Colonel entering, asked which were
the two members. The President starting up said,
"Every man you see here is an Epresmenil and a
Monsambert," intimating that all agreed in their
sentiments. Such was the vacillation which followed
this attempt at vigour that Colonel Degout was
unable to obtain further instructions from the Court
for nearly four and twenty hours after he made
his report. Meanwhile the Parliament was locked

<!-- vol 3 page 7 -->

up, the troops surrounded it, the Colonel came
again and threatened all who refused to obey,
with the pains of treason. A dead silence was
the only answer made; when the two members
voluntarily surrendered themselves and were immediately
sent to distant prisons, one as far as
the Island in Provence where the man in the Iron
Mask had formerly been confined. A vehement remonstrance
of the Parliament was the immediate
consequence; the King was plainly charged with a
design to govern unconstitutionally by arbitrary
power; and a fixed determination was expressed
on behalf of the nation, never to suffer the laws to
be trampled upon, or to respect the Royal authority
unless it were exercised according to law and justice.
The second meeting of the Notables, which quickly
followed, led to further discontent with the Court,
and the outrages in Britany and Dauphin&eacute; plainly
showed that the provinces at the least shared in the
excitement of Paris and its Parliament.</p>

<p>"When we lately discussed the policy and the
conduct of the King," said the Baron, "we made
no allowance for the unfortunate influence of his
family."</p>

<p>"On that score," the Marquess observed, "I cannot

<!-- vol 3 page 8 -->

possibly make any allowance at all. To yield to
their entreaty what he refuses to his lawful, regular,
and responsible advisers, or what his own deliberate
judgment disapproves, is only another form of
charging him with misconduct, if indeed it be not
an aggravation of his offence. Mark, I am speaking
your high language, which imputes to sovereigns as
offences all their great errors."&mdash;"But at least," said
M. La Croasse, "we must allow something for the
influence of one so connected with him as his Queen
is, to say nothing of her fascinating personal qualities."&mdash;"I
hold," said the Baron, "that a man who
would suffer a woman to govern him in such a situation
as the king's, and in such a crisis as the present,
is wholly unworthy of a throne."&mdash;"What?" said
Mme. de Chatillon, "and are we to be told that a
woman, merely because she is a woman, must be
regarded as a cypher, treated as a mere empty pageant
of a court, brought into the ball-room, or the
card-room, or the royal box at the theatre, by way
ornament, and then be silenced when she would
speak her mind on state-affairs, in which she has as
deep a stake as any mortal breathing, with the insulting
remark 'you are but a woman?' "&mdash;"I crave
your mercy," said he, "but I only was considering

<!-- vol 3 page 9 -->

that, there being certain most essential functions
women never can perform, as sitting in council, holding
office, commanding troops, and indeed our law
barring the throne itself against them"&mdash;"But not
the regency," she quickly replied, "and I fancy Anne
of Austria was about as able a governor as either her
husband or her grandson. Besides, all you say&mdash;or
nearly all&mdash;is applicable to certain professions whose
members you yet allow to meddle with state-affairs&mdash;what
say you to priests? They can neither command
troops, nor act as judges, nor be governors of
provinces; and yet both in France and Spain they
have more power than most of the laity,"&mdash;"Yes,"
said Mme. de Bagnolles, "and I recollect an anecdote
of our English King, James II., who, on the
Spanish ambassador's advising him rather to be
counselled by his ministers than his priests, asked if
the King of Spain did not go by the advice of his
confessor, 'He does,' said the Spaniard, 'and that
is exactly the reason why our affairs go so badly.' "</p>

<p>The Countess here broke out in an enumeration
of the empresses and queens who had distinguished
themselves by talents for governing, and was extremely
wroth with young Deverell for citing the old
saying, that things prosper under queens better than

<!-- vol 3 page 10 -->

under kings, because men rule under those, women
under these. She also was not a little irritated at
the silence which the Baron kept during her dispute,
in which she stood alone. He not only abstained,
from the uneasiness which he laboured under on account
of Emmeline, who was confined to her room
that day by indisposition; but he avoided joining the
conversation on account of his fair idol herself, whom
he had of late found it extremely difficult to deal
with. If he opposed her, she would be angry in a
covert and suppressed manner; if he agreed with
her, she would show an outright and open irritation.
It seemed quite impossible to avoid giving her
offence. She appeared to be ill at ease with herself;
and to visit upon others the consequences of her own
indiscreet avowal of love; but most of all upon him
to whom it had been made, and who was its cause.
Nothing, however, gave her more offence than his
thwarting her in any place from tender care for her
personal comfort or her safety. If he besought her
not to expose herself to the air at sunset for fear of
the inflammatory attack which such imprudence is
apt to bring on; if he anxiously warned her against
driving a pair of half-broken horses, which the Chevalier
had yoked to a light phaeton; or if he would

<!-- vol 3 page 11 -->

only have her write her letters so early as not to be
hurried for the post; and when she was too late, if
he offered to ride with them afterwards himself to
the town&mdash;all these attentions, merely because they
proceeded from a warm interest taken in whatever
concerned her, seemed to pass for the fruits of some
selfish suggestion, as if she mistook the Baron's care
about her for a care about himself, merely because he
preferred her ease to his own. But of all the offences
which he could commit, the one most past forgiveness
was any advice, or hint, how delicately soever conveyed,
even if wrapped up in the language of devoted
admiration, but which pointed to any error in her
conduct. "Might I venture, dearest friend, with the
deepest respect," he would say, trembling for the reception
his admonition might meet, "only thinking
of yourself, and desiring that you may be as perfect
in all other eyes as you are in mine,&mdash;might I venture
to wish you would spare those taunts thrown out
upon our amiable friend the Marchioness? You
lack no praise for wit, no fame as a satirist."&mdash;"Baron,
I don't comprehend you," was the instant
reply. "I suppose I am to have my opinion as well
as other people."&mdash;"Pray, for God's sake, my dearest
Countess, don't be so angry."&mdash;"I am not angry

<!-- vol 3 page 12 -->

at all. Baron; I am only tired, and bored, and
plagued to death with such stupid observations."&mdash;"But,
dearest lady, I had but one motive or feeling&mdash;anxious
friendship, a constant regard for you, and
desire to see you as lovely as you are fascinating."
This put an end to all possibility of continuing the
conversation: she vowed that it was treating her like
a child, and declared that if there was anything she
disliked more than every other, it was people taking
the trouble of being friendly and anxious about her.</p>

<p>But a very untoward circumstance soon occurred;
or rather had, unknown either to the Baron or herself,
occurred two months before, and was now first
brought to her knowledge. Ernest Deverell had not
for so long a time gazed upon her charms without
being captivated, like all other gazers; but having
more self-confidence, and having also had so much
success in the circles of Paris, he was less discouraged
than others in what to them seemed a hopeless pursuit.
His cleverness, his easy and polished manners,
had made his professed admiration bearable
and even palatable to her; and as the slightest
encouragement sufficed to raise hopes in him, a mere
trifle, of no moment whatever, her asking him to
drive her in his father's open carriage, inspired him

<!-- vol 3 page 13 -->

with positive expectations of victory; for this incident
happened at a time when some coldness between
her and the Baron gave Ernest's watchful eyes the
notion of a quarrel having taken place, and even of
all intercourse having ceased with his happy rival.
The reception he met with was most cold and
humiliating; it was even contemptuous; and the
tone of the Countess was to be angry, and resent
his advances as an insult to her position, her married
state. The youth was piqued by the severity of her
language, and the scorn which she evinced, and
which plainly was not put on for the occasion; he
was thrown off his guard; and in a moment of
irritation he hinted plainly enough that he knew
more than she could wish of her friendship for
M. de Moulin. He dwelt on that "<i>friendship</i>"
with a sneering emphasis; this enraged the fair one
beyond endurance; she increased the bitterness of
her speech towards him; when he in a mock tender
tone, and as if imitating her voice while he threw
himself into her attitude, whispered tenderly the
words "<i>My dearest friend</i>," which she had so often
felt she would give worlds to recall, but which
she had always believed were only breathed in the
Baron's ear. She screamed and grew pale. Her

<!-- vol 3 page 14 -->

anger suddenly fell, and terror only remained.
Deverell, sincerely vexed at his own intemperance,
tried to comfort and to soothe her. She eyed him
as if she grudged him the air he breathed, and
thought each moment his life was prolonged, an age.
He was too honourable to leave the least doubt on
the source of his information, lest the Baron might
be supposed to have made a confidence to him. He
at once declared that he was in the Orangery, in the
dark, unknown to her, and, surprised by their coming
in, had been an involuntary witness of the declaration
and endearments which preceded the Baron's
journey to Lyons. Of course he was lavish in his
excuses for having alluded to the subject, and as
lavish in his solemn vows never again to let the most
remote allusion to it cross his lips. All was vain;
she refused all comfort; she vowed she cared not
whom he apprised of it, so he never dared to insult
her by coming near the subject; and she then broke
away to her own apartment, where, unable to read,
or write, or speak, or think, she flung herself upon
the sofa, in an agony of mortified pride and vexatious
fear combined, the mixture which most
entirely unhinges the mind, as that of some mineral
poisons, mercury and antimony for instance, has

<!-- vol 3 page 15 -->

a like power of suddenly decomposing the bodily
frame in some habits.</p>

<p>It did not tend much to soothe her in this state of
distress, that there were manifest indications of the
party at length breaking up at the Ch&acirc;teau. Various
accidents had led to its continuance being prolonged;
but notwithstanding the near relationship of the
parties, the Count could not remain much longer,
and even if he did, the Baron, who had been
repeatedly at the end of all the excuses he could
devise for lingering on in the society he most loved,
must now leave the south, and point his steps
towards his own country. The prospect before her,
therefore, was anything rather than cheerful. She
was much in the power of one whom she neither
respected nor esteemed, and who on his restoration
to his proper orbit, the Parisian circles, might, for
anything she could tell, make her weakness the
topic of his mirth in general society, or of his confidential
disclosures to those he was addressing. She
was still more in the power of another, but him she
passionately loved; and from him she must in all
probability soon be separated, only to meet late in
the ensuing season, when she might find him
absorbed in politics, or changed in his feelings

<!-- vol 3 page 16 -->

towards her. The aspect of public affairs gave her
comparatively little uneasiness: she was not apt to
be alarmed; very prone to indulge in sanguine
views of all but her own personal concerns. However,
a long and serious illness into which the
Marchioness de Bagnolles fell about this time, and
which would have made it cruel to leave the Marquess,
seemed to give her a respite, and she begged,
she intreated, she implored the Baron to defer his
journey. Towards him she no longer could show
any of her accustomed pride, as if she were unable
to spare any of it from Ernest, against whom its
concentrated vehemence was all levelled. For the
more she stood in dread of his disclosures, and the
more she felt herself in his power, the more proudly
did she behave towards him, the more scornfully
did she on every occasion treat him. She seemed
to defy him, and acted as if she would obliterate
the evidence of his senses and his memory by carrying
herself like one entirely innocent, and even
unjustly slandered. She behaved as if she had
forgotten everything herself, and as if she could by
ill-treatment erase everything from his recollection,
having by some preternatural effort blotted it from
her own. Ernest, on his part, heartily sorry for

<!-- vol 3 page 17 -->

having been betrayed into a disclosure which he felt
ought never to have escaped his lips, bore all her
demeanour with the greatest calmness, and even
good humour; nor did this administer much to her
relief; she rather was vexed to see his imperturbable
temper, so unlike her own, and drew from it a conclusion
that he would take his revenge when she
should not be present to protect herself.</p>

<p>Meanwhile events went on thickening around them.
The announcement was made that the King had at
length resolved upon calling the States General,
and the third Assembly of the Notables was to
occupy itself with arranging the plan of their election
and the order of their proceedings. M. La
Croasse had now left the Ch&acirc;teau, unable to prolong
his visit like the other guests, but of two gentlemen
from Nismes, who were frequent visitors there, one,
the Chief Judge of the Languedoc Tribunal, fully
supplied his place; for his principles were as much on
the extreme of royalism, and his fears of change were,
from his enlarged views, if possible, more disquieting.
Though a man of a firm mind, M. de Chapeley
could descry no bright spot in the whole of the
overclouded and unsettled horizon now surrounding
them. The other, M. Catteau, also a lawyer, but

<!-- vol 3 page 18 -->

only a private practitioner, and though clever and
not ill-informed, yet without success in his profession,
gave his whole mind to politics, and had rushed into
the most violent extreme of what were now termed
"constitutional opinions." His respect for the judge
did not in any way mitigate the extravagance of the
language he held in his presence; he treated his
alarms as delusions arising from his station, and
avowed himself devoted to the cause of the people.
When M. de Chapeley mildly reminded him of the
risk which others ran who had property, rank, station,
or professional distinction, and consequent
gains, to lose, while he at least was playing a game
entirely safe, and in which the loss of all other
classes might make him, and those like him, winners,
he laughed scornfully as he said,&mdash;"They who
like me have what is insolently called nothing to
lose, have taken no bribe from fortune, through any
of the channels whereby she corrupts. We are
neither gained over to the abuses of the existing system
by sharing in them at Court, or by holding offices
in the law, or by enjoying professional incomes, or
by possessing wealth in any shape&mdash;for in any shape
wealth is a bribe, being enjoyed in security only
while public affairs remain steadily quiet."&mdash;"Has

<!-- vol 3 page 19 -->

it never struck you, my dear Catteau," said the
Marquess, "that as all true patriots must be anxious
for whatever best promotes the interest of their
country at large, if your principle were acted upon,
and only those courses pursued which benefited
or which pleased men without any stake in the
country, the fearful consequence must be the sacrifice
of the whole to the advantage or the gratification of
a very trifling part?"&mdash;"Yes, truly," said the lawyer,
"a very trifling part, if we are to be regarded
as all, without reckoning those we represent. But
be pleased to consider that we speak the sentiments
and maintain the cause of the million.
We have little ourselves, but those we represent
have less; and trust me that in the end they must
prevail."</p>

<p>"Catteau," said the Judge, "I know your doctrine,
and any more dangerous never was broached
or was preached. Your rule is always to go to
the extreme of any opinion, and to spurn all
qualification, all mitigation of it, as a compromise
with the adversary, and an abandonment of principle.
It was in this way you cut out Jussieu as
a leader of faction, an able and learned man, but
who had some reason, some moderation in his

<!-- vol 3 page 20 -->

opinions, while you went to the uttermost extent on
all questions."</p>

<p>"And if I found any one go further than I now
go," said Catteau, "I should at once shoot a-head
of him, provided it was in the right direction."</p>

<p>"Meaning thereby," said the Judge, "the high
popular direction&mdash;the direction taken by those who
inculcate upon the public the belief of their own
unity, their own omnipotence, their own omniscience."</p>

<p>"I don't much quarrel," he replied, "with your
description; my fixed opinion being that such
is the course which the better part of the State
must now take. The States General are convoked
for next May. What care I for the instrument
which commissions the Notables, a set of crown
nominees, nobles, magistrates, and the like, to
regulate their proceedings? When they shall meet
will they regard the opinions of the packed and
despicable Notables?"&mdash;"However," the Judge
said, "the mode of electing them will, meantime,
be fixed, and that must influence the constitution
of the body."&mdash;"Not in the least," said Catteau.
"Enough for me that a thousand or twelve hundred
men are to be delegated, and two from the

<!-- vol 3 page 21 -->

Commons, or third estate, for every one from the
privileged orders. I wonder how in the present
temper of men's minds any such assembly can be
chosen that will not run headlong towards the
fundamental change, what I call the real reformation,
of our whole system."&mdash;"I fear," said M.
Chapeley, with a deep sigh, "I fear me your
prediction is too likely to be realized; I grieve
to think of the stormy times that await us. One
comfort I have is that I shall not long remain to
see and to suffer."&mdash;"And I, sir," said the fiery
advocate of the people, his only client, "I glory
in the hope that we are touching upon the
age of great events; when men of genuine principle
will rise to the surface; and your moderates,
and compromising time-servers, with their worldly
ambition, your Jussieus, in a word, will be precipitated
to the bottom, and no more heard of than
the other dregs to which they naturally belong in
the mass."</p>

<p>The conversation was interrupted by a message
suddenly brought to the Chevalier, who was sitting
musing on the talk he heard, but taking no part
in it. The purport was alarming to him, and he
quitted the room. The Marquess ran after him, and

<!-- vol 3 page 22 -->

returned with the intelligence that Ernest Deverell
had had a severe fall; that he lay senseless at a
neighbouring inn, whither his father was gone:
and that he had never spoken since the accident.
The Countess hastily left the room, and sent for
Chatillon. "I do desire that you will instantly
follow the Chevalier, and ascertain all the particulars
of this accident."&mdash;"Why, really, my love," said
he, "I hardly think it becoming in me to show so
much more anxiety than his own nearest relations,
all of whom, doubtless, feel alarmed and interested
in his fate, but"&mdash;"Fate," said she, her eyes
glittering with extraordinary lustre&mdash;"Fate! you
speak of fate! Is there a&mdash;chance"&mdash;she added,
as if hesitating for a word and then taking the
wrong one&mdash;"I mean a fear&mdash;is there a fear for
the young man's life?"&mdash;"Why, I apprehend there
is"&mdash;her husband answered.&mdash;"Then may not I
feel anxious, interested&mdash;alarmed, I mean&mdash;as well
as any one else?&mdash;I suppose there's no harm in
that." There was a something that powerfully
struck the Count, in this extreme eagerness, so
unlike her who never seemed to care for one man
more than another, unless in so far as he contributed
to her amusement or to her political information.

<!-- vol 3 page 23 -->

The idea hastily passed through his mind, that, had
his nature been jealous, here seemed an occasion for
feeling that vexation. This made his refusal any
longer look like having such a feeling, and as no man
can bear to be suspected of jealousy until the eve of
its final explosion, he at once said he would go, as
she desired it.&mdash;He went, leaving her on the very
rack of anxious and eager expectation that every
step she heard approach her door would bring
the most interesting intelligence. Foot after foot
came, the bearer of persons wholly ignorant,
most of them wholly careless, of the young man's
condition. At length, impatient beyond endurance
at the delay, she went to the library, then to the
salon, then to the billiard-room; but all were gone
to their apartments before dinner, and she could
find no one possessed of the least information upon
that which so deeply interested her. She returned
to her own room. Soon after Chatillon came, with a
gay countenance and said, "Thank God!"&mdash;"Thank
God, for what, then?"&mdash;she exclaimed, seizing hold
of his wrist and looking as through him with her
fierce eye. "For what are we to thank God?"&mdash;she
repeated.&mdash;"Why, that he is quite safe, my
dear."&mdash;"Quite safe!"&mdash;she roared, casting his hand

<!-- vol 3 page 24 -->

from her with a swing that made it vibrate round
his body. "Oh, yes!" she added, resuming her self
possession; " Oh, yes! He is safe,&mdash;thank&mdash;God!&mdash;But
I desire to know what kept you so long while
I was waiting in anxious impatience? Did you
walk on purpose to lose so much time? Was that
your kind, good-natured, obliging plan?"&mdash;He now
knew that something, he could not tell what, had
put her in a bad humour; and that any one thing
would then be made the ground of picking a quarrel,
and the theme of the quarrelsome discourse. Indeed,
she began upon another topic and expressed
herself with extreme anger about a book she had got
from him, attacking some things in it as if he had
been the author rather than the owner of the work.
So, muttering between his teeth somewhat like
"Thank God, I have got a hat,"&mdash;he quietly withdrew
to take a walk alone, when she recommended
him to keep his sneers for those whom they better
suited, and to save his piety for a fitter occasion, as
his hat could be of little use to him while every one
was dressing for dinner.</p>

<p>She now, by an effort, regained her outward
composure; but nothing that passed that evening
had the least power to engage her attention, unless

<!-- vol 3 page 25 -->

when some account came from the Chevalier at the
inn, or when the particulars of the accident were
talked of. Her spirits were now exhausted by the
two vicissitudes, each of them sudden, which her
mind had in a short period of time undergone.
In one minute she had heard of Ernest being
seriously, she had easily believed fatally, hurt; in
another mind, within only an hour from that intelligence,
she had heard and believed, as certainly
though less readily, that the injury proved immaterial.
She was now in the self-same predicament as
three hours before. But she had undergone alarm
and anxiety and suspense quite sufficient to shake
her nerves and exhaust her spirits, and she took no
interest and bore no part in the general conversation,
which again rolled upon the critical state, as
all allowed it to be, of the country.</p>

<p>"What is your opinion, M. de Chapeley," said
the Baron, "of the spirit generally prevailing
among the people? Will they show that they feel
much interest in the passing events, or will the
movement now spreading be confined to a few
places, such as Grenoble and Rennes, where the
Parliaments have taken an active part in the controversy?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 26 -->

<p>The President said, "Always admitting how difficult
a problem it is to determine what the people will
do, or even what opinions actually prevail among
them, because we never can have the requisite data
for solving it, my notion is, that as a mass they do
not take any great interest in the present disputes.
The state of the finances, the cause of all the mischief,
little affects, unless it be the Gabelle, those
who have no property; the feudal exactions form
no part of the grievances sought to be remedied,
and if they did they only affect the country people,
and chiefly the small proprietors; whereas when
you speak of the people, in connection with a revolutionary
movement, you mean of course the masses
congregated in large towns, and not the individuals
scattered over farms or only inhabiting small villages.
The effects of the great grievance of all, the
<i>lettres de cachet</i>, absolutely pass over their heads,
and strike only the upper ranks. The quarrels of
the Parliaments they care nothing whatever about;
for the lawyers never had any popular following
among us. Indeed, the parliamentary places are
property, being bought, and sold, and inherited;
and their holders, belonging to the aristocracy, are
regarded like other proprietors."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 27 -->

<p>"But, M. le Chef Juge," said the Baron, "you
will recollect that both at Grenoble and Toulouse,
the people took part with the Parliament, and even
broke out into excesses. Count Perigord, our governor
of Languedoc, was forced to fly, and the
two regiments to be withdrawn, while the multitude
actually took up the paving-stones as if to prepare
for a siege."</p>

<p>"I am far from affirming," said the Judge, "that
such gross indiscretion as violently banishing these
two Parliaments for acting in the discharge of their
public duty, how erroneously soever that of Grenoble
may have proceeded on the subject of <i>lettres de
cachet</i>, will produce no sympathy among those
who, generally speaking, care nothing for those judicial
and administrative bodies; and, indeed, I
excepted the towns where Parliaments are, when I
expressed my belief that the present ferment is not
universal. I must add, that if such vigorous measures
were to be taken in these places, common
prudence dictated the necessity of being well prepared
to support them,"</p>

<p>"Then," said the Baron, "don't you imagine
that the issuing of this decree calling the States will
produce some general excitement? Is it not natural

<!-- vol 3 page 28 -->

to expect that the exercise of the right of electing
deputies will soon inoculate the people with a political
feeling, should they have none at present?"</p>

<p>"Why, hardly," said M. de Chapeley; "I
hardly expect that many of the people will attend
the elections. The elective office is a function they
never have been used to perform; nor is the exercise
of it, the mere choice of a delegate whose functions
are also very obscurely conceived by them, likely to
interest them greatly."</p>

<p>"In England, however," said M. Catteau, "the
people take the liveliest interest in their elections.
The sovereignty of the people there assumes a truly
imposing attitude, and makes both peers and princes
tremble."</p>

<p>"Why, Catteau," said the Judge, " you are forgetting
two material things; the functions of the
deputies are, in England, familiar to the electors,
because they are accustomed for ages to see them
exercised in the legislation, and even the government
of the country; and their own functions, as electors,
have become equally well known to them, from the
assiduous court paid, and I fear occasionally from
the undue means taken to obtain, even corruptly
obtain, their suffrages."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 29 -->

<p>"In France," said Catteau, "I glory to think
such means must fail. The divine attributes of the
people in their sovereign capacity never can be
brought to so low a level by corruption any more
than by intimidation. Witness the glorious conduct
of Toulouse, where the military threatened in vain,
and were forced to retreat."</p>

<p>"Catteau," said the Judge, "I have no more reliance
upon the political purity than I have upon the
political courage of uneducated men, or upon their
political wisdom or their virtue when acting in large
masses. Nor is there one of them whose judgment
on any matter, be he acquainted or not with the
subject, I would not infinitely rather trust, taking it
from him individually, than I would the opinion of
the mass to which he belongs, of which he forms a
unit among thousands, and which is sure to act by
impulse, consulting always its feelings, and never its
reason. Nay, I go farther&mdash;there is such a contagious
effect in violence, when once you assemble
your mob, that the same man who individually
would be safe to follow, or to command, or to advise
with, shall become as heedless of consequences, and
as utterly useless for all purposes, as if he were
no longer the same individual, nor indeed is he."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 30 -->

<p>"For all purposes, thank God," said the Advocate,
"except one, and for that, thank God also,
their perfect use consists in their numbers."&mdash;"And
pray what may that one excepted function
be, the bare thought of which makes your countenance
radiant, and your breath devoutly thankful?"&mdash;"For
the purpose of action!" said Catteau, with a
sinister look and a grin of ferocious delight.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said the calm and clear-seeing
Judge. "Yes, for action no doubt, and for something
else, which I make no manner of question you
also have in your eye,&mdash;for submission, for obedience
to the will of its leaders, no doubt a mob, because
of the very defects I am alluding to, is naturally
both a blind instrument and a sharp tool; both
prone to follow whatever impulsion is given by the
leader's hand, and powerful to cut its way through
all that may resist. But when you speak with such
triumph of the force which multitudes acquire from
their power as well as their mass, from the contagious
feelings that influence them as well as from
the numbers they consist of, don't forget the other
qualify of your ally&mdash;your tool, let me again call it.
If that tool be blind and be sharp, it is also apt
to prove slippery; nay, apt to have its edge turned.

<!-- vol 3 page 31 -->

and turned the more easily the finer it is, when it
suddenly encounters any obstacle."&mdash;"Again," said
Catteau, " I cite the courage displayed at Toulouse."&mdash;"And
again," said the Judge, "I will express
my sad impression of the cruel injustice which
closed the events of that day; when the most beloved
of all the nobles in this country, I might say in
France itself, he who the week before had been the
darling of all ranks, even of the populace itself,
was forced to fly from the seat of his government,
having remained there twenty-four hours at the imminent
peril of his life. Let me add that when you
praise the courage of the undisciplined multitude,
you also are forgetful of its fleeting nature, its capricious
character. One hour they will under the
influence of strong excitement face a battery, another
they will fly from a couple of sentinels. Then I
must observe that, whether congregated or acting separately,
the unembodied people are the natural prey
of a similar kind of fear. They are apt, exceedingly,
incurably apt to credit all rumours, to be
influenced by all panics; and, even where no such
sudden influence is applied to their minds, they are
exceedingly prone to bend and crouch before any
authority, be it a man, a party, or a mob, parcel of

<!-- vol 3 page 32 -->

their own body, in whom power is for the moment
vested, and by whom it is displayed."</p>

<p>"I have heard," said the Marquess, "that this was
exhibited in a striking manner both at Toulouse and
at Grenoble during the late riots. They tell me that,
at Grenoble particularly, a few hundred miscreants
kept the whole people of the town in awe during their
reckless, pillaging proceedings; while at Toulouse
multitudes were compelled to join the insurgents,
and still greater numbers lo look on as passive spectators
and acquiesce in what they most disapproved,
because the mob, that is, a thousand or two led on
by a hundred or two, had gotten possession of the
place."</p>

<p>"Depend upon it, Catteau," said the Judge, "it
thus is and ever will be with the mere multitude.
You cannot rely on their steady purpose in desiring
any objects, nor can you reckon on their firm resolution
in executing any plan; and they are truly,
like the dealers in magic, those who are familiar
with evil spirits, oftentimes the victims of the terrors
they inspire."</p>

<p>When M. de Chapeley left the Ch&acirc;teau, which he
did after dinner, good-naturedly taking M. Catteau
in his carriage, the Baron mentioned to his host

<!-- vol 3 page 33 -->

how much he had been struck with the learned
judge's conversation, his profound sense, as well as
happy expression, set off by the most winning good
nature and delightful manners.</p>

<p>"He is indeed," said the Marquess, "all you say
and more. There have been few men more eminent
at our bar; nor would he discredit the most exalted
station in the profession he adorns. His father was
one of our most eminent artists, and the son has
from college upwards been always the most distinguished
of his contemporaries. At Montpellier
he carried away the highest honours as a profound
and elegant mathematician, his taste ever keeping
pace with his solid, substantial acquirements. In
manly vigour of mind, in a sagacity that never fails
him, be it applied to great purposes or to smaller
objects, in a happy power of throwing away the husk
of any subject he has to master and reaching at once
the kernel, he stands unequalled in the law. He
was, as an advocate, skilful, dexterous, learned,
ready, undaunted; as a judge his calm impartiality,
his universal courtesy, his unwearied patience, can
only be exceeded by his unexampled clearness and
conciseness of statement, the soundness of his views,
and the cogency of his reasoning. But if in most

<!-- vol 3 page 34 -->

things he excels others, in one he seems to exceed
himself. I would go any distance to enjoy again a
treat I lately had the relish of, when he displayed
to its utmost perfection, his great faculty of clear,
connected, interesting narrative, without a single
remark, or any attempt to apply his facts to his
purpose&mdash;yet so completely effecting that purpose
by painting to his auditory a lively picture of the
whole case, that the most elaborate reasoning could
not have more perfectly secured the adoption of his
conclusions. They tell me that he, t'other day,
equally astonished the court in which he presides,
by a clear and vigorous statement of above twenty
ordinances and edicts, giving the dates and the substance
of each, without omitting even one figure,
though without a single note to help his recollection.
They say it was like a code of penal law (for penalties
were the subject), from the edict of Moulins to
the present time."&mdash;"And yet this extraordinary
man," said the Baron, "is turned of seventy! Was
he ever in greater mental force when younger?"&mdash;"Not
at all; it was impossible he should. Nay,
his body is as robust, and his intellect as clear as
ever, that is to say, as any man's of any age can be.
He has an amiable, and handsome, and accomplished

<!-- vol 3 page 35 -->

daughter, whom you saw here the other
day."</p>

<p>"I am aware of that," the Baron said; "my
niece describes her as a delightful person; she has
made her acquaintance, and likes her exceedingly.
She tells me that M. de Chapeley is, in private life,
the most amiable of men, as indeed, from all we see
of him in society, one can easily believe. Pray, had
he ever any political functions?"&mdash;"You are aware,"
said the Marquess, "that in our constitution, which,
for any thing I know, differs from your Netherland
system, the lawyer rarely if ever exercises any administrative
functions. But M. de Chapeley, beside
having been Procureur du Roi for some years, was
much consulted in difficult times by the Governors
of Languedoc. His unshaken firmness proved, in all
difficult emergencies, a match for the occasion, and
bore its full proportion to his unfailing sagacity and
his fertility of resource. He often, indeed for many
years generally, found himself opposed to his old
and valued friend, M. de Balaye, now Second Judge
in his court; and who had been a more eloquent and
popular, though no man could be a more learned or
skilful advocate, while both were at the bar. They
resembled one another in their love of scientific

<!-- vol 3 page 36 -->

pursuits, and in their agreeable manners, though the
temper of our friend was always far milder than
that of his fellow lawyer, but in their views of public
affairs they often differed, and sometimes the one
and sometimes the other prevailed. Of late, their
long private friendship has never suffered even a
moment's interruption from political differences,
(indeed, it never did for above a moment at a
time), both being now indissolubly knit together by
their common apprehension of such leaders as the
Catteau faction would prove; and thus their harmony
is unbroken. Balaye is several years younger than
the First President, and delights in making his
heavy duties and important functions easy to him;
and in private life they are, as indeed, they always
have been, inseparable friends. There is nothing
which these two humane and just judges have
had more at heart than mitigating the sufferings of
unfortunate persons who, without any fault of their
own except poverty, being unable to pay their debts,
are by the hard necessity of the judge's office consigned
through his sentence, to the degradation, the
suffering, and even the pollution of a prison. M.
de Chapeley and M. de Balaye have given themselves
unwearied pains to effect the release of this

<!-- vol 3 page 37 -->

unhappy class of people, furthering every plan of
compromise with their creditors, and even introducing
rules of practice into their courts which have
the effect of preventing many arrests, and of liberating
many already in prison. It is their fixed
opinion, indeed, which on all occasions they declare,
that imprisonment never should be for debt,
but only for fraudulent practices or other misconduct,
provided the debtor be willing honestly and
fairly to give up all his property for distribution
among his creditors. In their endeavours to bring
about the adoption of this wise and just principle,
these two friends and colleagues co-operate with
indefatigable zeal, while Catteau consumes the day
in wild and furious talk."</p>

<p>"I am thankful," said the Baron, "for your
kindness in giving me this portrait of these two distinguished
friends. I only wish poor Emmeline
had heard what, from her intimacy with Mdlle.
de Chapeley, would so much have interested her.
Of the Catteau tribe you have said but little."&mdash;"Nearly
about as much as they merit," the Marquess
said. "Nothing can well be more despicable,
in all respects, but one; having no restraining connection
with the power of the country, they have no

<!-- vol 3 page 38 -->

principle, no fear of consequences, either here or
hereafter; but, excepting the facility which this gives
them to lead on the mob forces, they have no kind
of resources (<i>moyens</i>). Without solid learning, or
any learning that deserves the name; without any
one valuable accomplishment; with no talent save
that basest of all faculties, the power to string sentences
together which may tickle the ear of the multitude;
with no restraint from principle, more than
any responsibility under which they act&mdash;they would
willingly see all things flung into a state of hopeless
anarchy, that they might gain in the confusion, they
cannot clearly see what; but something and anything,
how little soever, would to them be a material gain,
because it has often been said that the greatest of
all steps is the transition from nothing to something.
I cannot help fearing that no small number of this pestilential
class will find their way into the States General,
where there may not be a Chapeley or a Balaye
to control them."&mdash;"No," said the Baron, "but there
may be a Mirabeau to lead them on."&mdash;"You agree,
I perceive," said the Marquess, "in the high estimate
which all men have formed of his capacity."&mdash;"Yes,"
the Baron replied, "and also in their low estimate
of his virtue. He is a man of the most brilliant

<!-- vol 3 page 39 -->

talents, and absolutely destitute of principle, which
makes it singularly unfortunate that his talents
should be exactly of the caste most adapted to shine
in troublous times, and especially to gain the
ascendant in popular assemblies. The first place,
and almost without a competitor, is certainly reserved
for him in the meeting of the States. When
I reflect on the integrity of M. Necker, who is sure
to be once more tried as minister of the Crown, and
set against his Genevese pedantry and German manners,
the wit, the worldly wisdom, and the eloquence
of Mirabeau, hampered by no reserve or modesty,
restrained by no regard for principle, I can hardly
doubt which will carry the day; and though he is
not at all likely to join with the base vulgar of the
Catteau tribe, he is very certain to give the popular
party a leader little disposed, if he were able, to
curb their unbridled licentiousness."</p>

<p>The party remained in the saloon later than usual,
in order to see the Chevalier on his return from the
inn, and learn the latest accounts of Ernest's accident
and state. He did not arrive home till long
after midnight, and they heard nothing from him
till they all met next morning at breakfast. Emmeline
was now well again, and the Countess had

<!-- vol 3 page 40 -->

recovered her equanimity sufficiently to join the
party, which now comprehended all but the Marchioness,
still confined to her apartment.</p>

<p>The entrance of the good Chevalier, his morning
face decked in smiles, and his expression of perfect
readiness for his morning meal, at once proclaimed,
without any detail of particulars, that his mind was at
ease, and that he had left his son quite safe the night
before. But all were anxious for the particulars.
"How did you leave your patient?" said the Marquess.&mdash;"Mons.
Ernest, n&eacute; Deverell," he answered,
"is as well as it can be expected that a man should
be, who was thrown from a carriage by the running
away of two ill-broken colts, the property of his
father."&mdash;"You were satisfied, I hope, with the
medical man? M. Cirac is well spoken of by all who
have anything to do with him."&mdash;"Why, brother
of mine, look you, my experience in this department
is limited; having never, God be thanked, had any
thing to do with that faculty; but, ignorant though
I be of their craft, I will hold a wager with the best
professor of Montpellier, that had my lad been left
to Cirac's doctoring, our faces would have been
some ell or twain longer to-day."&mdash;"Why so? I
never heard his cleverness called in question."&mdash;"Why,

<!-- vol 3 page 41 -->

as thus: when his Serene Cleverness arrived,
the lad was still senseless; and, remembering my
fox-hunting experience, I apprehended a concussion,
and took for granted there would be instant bleeding.
No such matter; but all I could get from the
doctor was that the patient was in a very alarming
state, which I knew quite as well as himself, and I
verily think could also as well have got him out of
it. I therefore proposed bleeding at once, 'Bleeding?'
said he, more drily than before. 'Bleeding,'
said I more peremptorily than before. 'Sir,' said
his Serene Dryness, 'Sir, as you are not, I presume,
his doctor, so you'll please to leave me alone in
my proper functions.' 'But,' said I, 'as I am his
father, I shall insist upon his being bled. Why,
what would you do, seeing him as you do senseless?'
'I may perhaps order him a leech or two to his
feet, and then a little cooling physic; then I should
be guided by circumstances. My rule is to follow
nature.' 'But, Doctor,' I said, unable to constrain
my impatience, when every moment was of the utmost
importance, 'if you wait to follow nature, I shall
follow my son to the grave; and, therefore, unless
you let him blood stoutly and like a man, I shall
send for my ally the barber in the village, in order

<!-- vol 3 page 42 -->

that you may not send for your ally the undertaker.'
This, I fear, somewhat offended his Serene Ability,
the doctor: he flounced out of the room; I could
hardly say, in any correctness of speech, that my
son's blood was upon his head, but I fired after him
a hearty curse, sent for the barber, and had the lad
well bled; and in half an hour he was in bed as
comfortable as I ever saw him in my life. I left him
at past midnight preparing to sleep, after taking a
cooling draught, and singing <i>La belle Gabrielle</i>,
while he expressed his satisfaction at having escaped
by any means, even a broken head, the worse accident
of Catteau's society, whom he particularly dislikes.
Verily," added the Chevalier, "I do protest
that these doctors be a generation which one may
call ignorant."&mdash;"Of medicine you mean," said
the Baron, drily; "of other things they seem to
know as much as the rest of us."</p>

<p>When the party went, as usual, after breakfast,
to sit on the benches under the porch, shaded from
the sun, Emmeline fell into the Countess's company,
and was expressing her confidence that this
accident would prove nothing. "Nothing, indeed!
Who told you that?" said Madame de Chatillon.&mdash;"You
heard the Chevalier's droll account," said

<!-- vol 3 page 43 -->

Emmeline. "Rely on it, unless all had been safe
he would not have been merry on the subject."&mdash;"Then,
I presume, you consider him as a high
medical authority. I never heard a less promising
case&mdash;but, perhaps, I know nothing of medicine
any more than the Chevalier, and your judgment
may be better."&mdash;"Dear Countess, I am the last
person in the world to trust it&mdash;especially in a case
of surgery; but I only go by the fact of the patient
having come entirely round, and recovered his
understanding and his spirits."&mdash;"Then does your
medical skill approve the Chevalier's practice, as
opposed to the Doctor's?"&mdash;"I have little doubt his
old fox-hunting experience may have led him to
treat a rather common accident in the right way;
but really I may be rather speaking after my wishes
than my judgment."&mdash;"Then I will only say this,
that a much more unpromising case I never heard
of than a person stunned to be senseless, and having
a concussion of the brain, being doctored by a person
as ignorant of medicine and surgery as the
animals that caused the accident, and as obstinate as
any mule, of whom they may be the cousins-german."&mdash;"Then,
dearest Countess, what are your
fears? for you alarm me."&mdash;"Why," said she, with

<!-- vol 3 page 44 -->

much eagerness, "it signifies little, I suppose, what I
fear; but I am next to certain that the man is gone,
though he may not die to-day or to-morrow; and
that if he recovers, his mind will be gone for life,
as never fails to happen after concussions like his,
half-cured, or not cured at all."&mdash;"Then what is the
poor young man to do? " cried Emmeline; "for his
place in the King's Guards will be gone, and on that
he mainly depends, I fear."&mdash;"To do? Why to
vegetate for life, if life remains in him; at all events
to be no longer a rational being, but one whose
faculties are gone&mdash;so that, though he may appear
pretty well at times, his mind will always be wandering,
his fancy at work, and his tongue be moved
ever after by a diseased imagination." She rose at
this, evidently a good deal excited, if not agitated,
and Emmeline joined her uncle in the library.</p>

<p>"What can it possibly be, dearest Zio," she said,
"that makes the Countess so irritable, not to say
cross besides? When I but expressed my notion that
M. Deverell was out of danger, which I really thought
seemed usually admitted, she got quite angry, chid
me for having an opinion at all, and pronounced
with decision, but with impatience of any contradiction,
that in all likelihood he could not recover."&mdash;"I

<!-- vol 3 page 45 -->

protest, my love," said he, "I cannot conceive why
she should be so much excited by the subject; she
never seemed to care a straw about Ernest, though he
made violent love to her for some time."&mdash;"Besides,
said Emmeline, "if she had cared for him, which
plainly she does not, why should she be so anxious
to prove him worse than he is? People generally,
the more they take an interest in any one, are the
more ready to believe good news of them."&mdash;"But,
darling child," he rejoined, "does Madame de Chatillon
really think he cannot recover?"&mdash;"Why,
she seemed to take hold immediately of that idea;
but she then said if he did recover, he never could
get back his mind, but would always wander, and
never could be trusted."</p>

<p>There was something in this report of his friend's
opinion, which set the Baron a musing for a length
of time. Aware of her designing, scheming nature,
which all his ardent passion for her could not blind
him to; knowing she never had any feeling, formed
any opinion, or conceived any wish without a meaning
or a plan&mdash;he thought there must needs be something
at the bottom of this extreme interest taken in
Ernest's recovery, or rather in his death; and the
alternative of his only getting well to be a person

<!-- vol 3 page 46 -->

no longer in his right mind&mdash;a person no one could
trust&mdash;seemed to him a very suspicious circumstance.
Now, though it be true, as the Baron knew,
that the Countess was a deep, and much reflecting
schemer, never doing, seldom saying, anything
for nothing, it was equally true, as the Countess
did not know, that the Baron was as designing, as
contriving, as deeply calculating a person as herself,
and a great deal more skilful in his calculations,
because he had the steadiness to pursue them, which
in men makes up for the want of a suspicious fancy,
the great engine of a woman's cunning. Therefore
he was on the alert and on the watch; nor did
many days pass in the unreserved intercourse which
the two friends daily had with each other, before he
had ascertained two points without the possibility
of doubt; the one was that the Countess hated
Ernest with a bitterness of hatred which must have
some good and sufficient cause&mdash;the other that there
was nothing she so earnestly desired as to see him
out of the way; in plain terms, that his death
would be a sensible gratification to her. A third
inference he had not quite so certainly arrived at,
but it was in perfect harmony with the other two,
and he reserved it for further consideration with a

<!-- vol 3 page 47 -->

kind of growing anxiety. It seemed to him as if
she must somehow or other be in Ernest's power,&mdash;else
why wish his death? Possibly, also, she was
afraid of his tongue&mdash;else why perhaps believe, and
at all events propagate the belief, that his mind
could no longer be trusted? One subject here was
wrapped in deep mystery. This young man, whom
she most certainly disliked and despised, and towards
whom she had always entertained even more
dislike than she of late did, in what way could he
possibly have the least power over her, or any
means of injuring her, all he could have to tell
being her rebuffs and slights of himself&mdash;perhaps to
a much greater degree than he had ever experienced
from any other woman? This was a mystery which
the Baron left time to unravel; he was only quite at
ease in his own mind upon the subject, secure of the
Countess's love, and far too proud to dread a rival.</p>

<p>That she appeared to him in an unamiable light,
through this affair, is certain&mdash;but he was blinded by
great passion. He had begun to besiege her, knowing
that the heart he deemed so well worth winning was
not the most amiable, nor indeed in some respects
the most single in the world. Finding it to be somewhat
harder than he had supposed did not awaken

<!-- vol 3 page 48 -->

him from his trance of love. He knew that to himself
it had been thoroughly softened; and he either
cared not, or endeavoured not to reflect, how exceedingly
it was hardened towards others, possibly
all the more since it had melted to him.</p>

<p>But Emmeline did not see with the same passion-blinded
eyes as her uncle; and she could not easily
avoid making somewhat harsher remarks than it was
her habit ever to indulge in. There was something
extremely unpleasant in the irritation which Madame
de Chatillon had shown, and the want of feeling
seemed manifest to a decree which Emmeline could
hardly have believed possible, especially in a woman.
As she never kept anything from her uncle that
passed in her mind, she resumed the conversation
soon after as they walked in the garden. "How,"
she asked, "can a person of so much mind, so lively
a spirit, and so full of intelligence, have so little
of the warmth which women's hearts are generally
subject to, even beyond that of men?"&mdash;"I cannot
think," said the Baron, "that our fair friend's
heart can be cold, with her warmth of temper, of
which you occasionally complain. These two things
generally don't go together."&mdash;"Why yes, Zio," said
Emmeline, "I have sometimes thought that all the

<!-- vol 3 page 49 -->

warmth in our friend's composition is drawn away
from her feelings by her temper."&mdash;"I hear it said,"
observed the Baron, "that her passions are cold."&mdash;"It
may be so," Emmeline answered, "if by passions
you mean a disposition to fall in love, which I
believe no one ever ascribed to the Countess. But
a hot temper may I fancy accompany a cold heart.
From all I see of hers, I would not take a present of
it, were it accompanied by all her beauty and all her
wit."&mdash;"My dear, dear child," said the Baron, delighted
with her uniformly right feeling and virtuous
principles, even where they led to a condemnation of
his enchantress&mdash;"all your sentiments, whether of the
head or the heart, are ever right. Whom you judge,
they are sure to have justice; and that justice ever
to be tempered with mercy."</p>

<p>As he meditated on the subject of this conversation,
he was again forcibly struck with the new light in
which the Countess seemed to have shown herself
on the present occasion. The thought unavoidably
forced admittance to his inward judgment, through
all his devoted fondness, that she was indeed made of
other materials than composed the singularly attractive
character of his beloved niece. Nay, he was
compelled once or twice to ask himself the appalling

<!-- vol 3 page 50 -->

question,&mdash;"Has she not desired the death of a fellow-creature,
for some reason unknown, but merely on
account of herself, her own interest, or her own fears?
If so, has she not committed a murder in her heart?"&mdash;But
such an idea, finding no harbour in his mind, no
sooner presented itself than it was forcibly rejected;
and by an effort, not hard to make, he flew for relief
and for protection against such an intrusion to the
mystery that veiled the whole of her conduct, clouding
over with obscurity and uncertainty that which
wore a very forbidding and sinister aspect.</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">THE WANDERER'S RETURN.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A severe</span> illness, the consequence of confinement,
to which his late life in the open air had not accustomed
him, seized the Solitary, and prevented
the Count from visiting him, except to inquire after
his health. At the end of some weeks he was nearly
recovered, and the old and confidential housekeeper
of the Marchioness, who had alone been intrusted
with the secret of his asylum in the Ch&acirc;teau, and
with the care of his apartment as well as the
supply of his table, said she thought a longer visit
of Chatillon might prove good for the spirits of the
invalid. He accordingly went, and found Albert
so far recovered that, after two visits of half an
hour each, he was able at the third interview to
continue his narrative.</p>

<p>"I have been revolving much in my mind," he
said, "since my illness began, and especially during

<!-- vol 3 page 52 -->

my recovery, the extraordinary history of my past
life, and the cause I have to mingle with much blame
of myself inexpressible thankfulness for the goodness
of God towards me. I have also reflected on the
length to which this account has extended, and the
unhappy aspect of almost every portion of it. I feel
disposed to close it, and relieve you from an endless
demand on your patience, the rather that, although
I have hitherto been able to give you some useful
information, and set before your mind several important
matters of opinion, in what remains there is
little of the same interest to be brought forward.
You must, however, be informed of the losses that
befel me, the hazards I encountered, and the accidents
that led to my seeking here a refuge from
the tempest to which my life has been exposed, until
it shall blow over.</p>

<p>"I left off before my illness at the island of Cuba,
where I passed several weeks, not devoid of interest,
but made very painful by the constant spectacle of
slave-vessels arriving from Africa, laden with their
dreadful freight of human wretchedness and human
guilt. I felt little inclination to prolong my stay in
the West Indies, or even in the slave-countries of the
continent; and I was on the point of setting out for

<!-- vol 3 page 53 -->

Port-au-Prince, in order to embark for the Northern
States, when the innkeeper with whom I lodged
told me that a gentleman who knew me had arrived
from St. Domingo, and brought me a letter which
had come there from New York. I eagerly sought
him out at the inn where he was said to have put
up, and I received from him the letter. My heart
beat high with hope and joy, not unmixed with
anxiety, as all our feelings are when far away from
those we love. It was a year since I had heard of
Louise or my mother, and the direction of the letter
was in M. Gardein's well known hand. I returned
to my own inn and went to my bed-room, that I
might open and read it. Alas! the first line went
like a dagger to my heart. That dear mother whose
image seems even now never absent from my mind,
sleeping or waking, had been taken from me after a
short illness, in which her constant conversation was
of the children she had lost. Her idea of my two
brothers, long as they had been separated from their
father's house, and surely as she had ever believed
they must have perished long years back, had, as she
approached her own end, been awakened, and her
tender feelings revived concerning them. Ever to
see them more she had long ceased to hope; but

<!-- vol 3 page 54 -->

still she felt that now she was about to leave the
world without even knowing their fate; while of me
and my checkered story she knew more, and most of
what she knew could shed little comfort round her
dying bed. Her latter end, however, was peace&mdash;and
peace such as the world cannot give. With all
her fellow-creatures she was at perfect peace; she
who, in her long life, never had harmed a human
being, and ever had done all the acts of kindness in
her power to all. With heaven she was at peace&mdash;the
peace flowing from the retrospect of so good a
life, the peace which calms the soul in its struggles
with mortality, and is a foretaste, almost a beginning,
of its more perfect tranquillity in the realms of bliss.
My father's desolation was described, and that,
abandoning all hopes of ever seeing his other sons,
he dwelt much upon my exile, and upon his anxious
wish that he might once more see me before he
departed. The pastor said nothing of Louise; and
in the melancholy state of mind into which the other
intelligence had thrown me, I hardly was aware at
first of the omission. He added, however, an intimation
of great moment to me. There were signs,
he said, not to be mistaken of great events and great
changes, both in civil and in ecclesiastical matters.

<!-- vol 3 page 55 -->

The clergy had no longer the same support as
formerly from the civil authorities; the government
itself was not equally strong; the priests, at all
events, whether as powerful or not, were no longer
as arrogant; they durst not venture upon holding
the same high tone, or attempting the same harsh
things; while most of the authorities were declared
supporters of a mild and tolerant policy. The good
pastor said that in all probability things would soon
assume an aspect which might make my return to
Languedoc safe; and he strongly recommended me
to come near the spot, so that I might be prepared
to rejoin my family once more, if events took, or
rather went on taking, a propitious turn.</p>

<p>"This letter determined my course, and, truth to
say, if I could hope for a tolerable chance of safety
in returning to Europe, I was nothing loth to give
up my scheme of again inhabiting the United States.
Even the northern country, though far more tolerable
than the south, little suited my taste; and I could
not help sighing over my long banishment, while I
began to be visited with a gleam of hope that I
might be destined once more to touch the soil of
dear France. A vessel freighted with produce for
Seville lay in the harbour of the Havanna; I found

<!-- vol 3 page 56 -->

no difficulty in obtaining a passage, with the last
remains of the little store I had scraped together
in America; and I soon found myself sufficiently
comfortable in her as a common passenger.</p>

<p>"It was impossible that I could feel otherwise than
extremely melancholy during the whole of the voyage,
after the irreparable loss I had sustained. My
waking moments were constantly passed in reflecting
on that dear person whom I should never more
behold. Every particular of her quiet, unobtrusive,
beneficent life came constantly to my memory. I
used to think, in the silence of the night, that I again
saw her sitting calm and composed alone, with her
work or a book in her hand; and I could see her
turn towards the door, as she was wont to do for
many years after my brothers disappeared, in the
hope of which she never could divest herself, that
some tidings of them would at length reach her. All
the little tender offices she used to perform towards
me in my youth&mdash;her lessons, her advice, her religious
warnings, above all, her kindly recommendation of
charity and good-will, as these came into my mind
used to bring tears in my eyes. Then I would
upbraid myself with any little offence I might ever
have given her&mdash;any harsh word, any impetuous

<!-- vol 3 page 57 -->

demeanour; these used to sting me to the quick as
I thought of the mildness of her rebukes, or her
sorrowful look when I gave her any cause of complaint.
For instance, it is a trifle, but it paints the
state of my mind:&mdash;I remembered having once
treated lightly the cheer which she presented on her
frugal table, after I perhaps had been living for a
few days with comrades, who indulged in more
luxury than suited the reduced circumstances of our
family. My harsh, thoughtless remark brought a
tear into her mild, tender eye; that one tear had at
the time cost me many, but how many more did it
make me shed on the passage home!&mdash;I have spent
whole hours of the endless night in such gloomy
reflections.</p>

<p>"After a week or ten days spent in the vessel, I
found that another American, or one passing for
such, was likewise on board; and it was natural
enough that we should make acquaintance together.
M. Cartigny soon expressed his opinion, that though
I talked English pretty well, there must be some
other language which I could speak better, and I at
once confessed to him that it was not my mother
tongue. Of his I entertained no manner of doubt,
for he spoke like a native, at least no one but a

<!-- vol 3 page 58 -->

native could have detected anything foreign either in
his language or his accent. He, however, acknowledged
that he came from Geneva, though he had
for many years been in England and for some time
in America. I then, having formed a favourable
opinion of him, let him know of what country I was,
at which he very frankly expressed some regret as
well as surprise; for, said he, 'As I never before met
with a Frenchman whom I could endure, and as you
appear to be an estimable man, my prejudices are
somewhat shocked.' It was rather amusing to find
a person so zealous in cherishing his prejudices, as
much so as most people would be in getting rid of
their's. Having, as you know, seen something of
Geneva and its inhabitants, I frankly gave him my
opinion of his countrymen, from which I did not find
him disposed to dissent very widely; but he contended
that for some time past they were no longer
what they once had been, and that their character
for honesty as well as for ability had been seriously
impaired. Still he very greatly preferred them to
the French, whom it was rather amusing to hear him
strip of every one quality they most plume themselves
upon, and which by common consent they are
allowed to possess. That he should deny their

<!-- vol 3 page 59 -->

solidity, their serious and reflecting nature, their
wisdom, even their sincerity, I could understand;
though to limit their capacity for profound study
seemed adventurous in the face of their achievements
in the severer sciences to which he could only oppose
his continual topic, a comparison with England, the
object of all his admiration, and as the native country
of Newton and Locke, exalted by his partiality into
not merely a higher station than France, but invested
with an exclusive claim to scientific merit and renown.
But as to the lighter accomplishments, the ornamental
parts of character, the graces of society, I
did suppose here he might make some few admissions
in favour of the French. No such thing;
their manners were all grimace; their music was a
constant effort and as constant a failure; their wit
was flippancy, their humour non-existing, their poetry
bombast; even their dancing he reckoned extravagant
and far inferior to the Italian; and in short I
found it in vain to look for a single confession except
on cookery, and even there he dwelt with an unpleasant
minuteness on the disgusting details of their
kitchen. His indignation, however, reached its
height when he spoke of the boasting habit, the self-complacency
of our countrymen, and their contempt,

<!-- vol 3 page 60 -->

not certainly quiet but rather clamorous, of other
nations. I ventured sometimes to place his Genevese
countrymen by the side of my own in this particular,
nor did he very much object to the juxta-position,
though he said the people of the 'perfect city,'
as he jocosely called it, were, though quite well satisfied
with themselves, yet rather more tranquil in
the transports of their self-love.</p>

<p>"In alluding to the great names of France, some
there were to whom of course he could not deny
their share of renown; he only tried to show that
either they had been bred, perhaps born abroad,
or had foreign blood in their veins, or, which
mightily comforted him when reduced to great
straits, had been ill-used, abjured, and persecuted by
their fellow-citizens. In some such fashion or other
he got rid of Henry IV., Sully, and Coligny, the
first the most amiable, and the other two the most
virtuous statesmen of any age or country. But his
invectives were fierce and unremitting against Charlemagne,
in so much that I once rallied him on it
as if he spoke from personal pique against one who
had been dead ten centuries. 'To be sure,' said
he, 'and our family was ill-treated and even ruined
by him and his vile corrupt emissaries, his Missi,

<!-- vol 3 page 61 -->

as he called them, whom he sent about the country,
that is the world, to decide causes contrary to
justice.' I found he derived exceeding great comfort,
under the praises generally lavished on Charlemagne,
from the notion of his having been thoroughly
defeated in Spain. As for his private life
he represented it as the most profligate ever known
in ancient or modern times, and that his palace was
one vast brothel, in which the Emperor's daughters
were the leading characters. I need scarcely add
that he in no wise gained me over to his opinion of
this great man, one of the few monarchs who may
be truly said to have lived before the age they flourished
in. But I more easily came into his opinion
of another character, his own countryman, at least
by adoption, Calvin, whom, of all men after the
Emperor of the West, he seemed most cordially to
hate. He had raked together all the Romish
slanders against his private character, affirming that
he had searched the books of the Court, where he
was charged with horrible offences, and durst not
defend himself, and had found the statements to be
founded on fact. However, his known and admitted
enormities were quite sufficient to warrant any
vituperation, and I went along with all he said

<!-- vol 3 page 62 -->

against the cruel, malignant, and selfish persecutor,
who had first tried to have his adversary in controversy
destroyed by a judicial proceeding abroad,
he furnishing underhand the evidence required, and
failing in that, had himself brought him to a trial
almost unexampled for injustice, and caused him to
be burnt alive. 'The history of persecution presents
no picture with harsher features,' said M. Cartigny;
'and yet such is the power of religious bigotry in
blinding the eyes and searing the heart, that there are
some millions of Christians, professing the religion of
charity and peace, who glory in calling themselves by
the name of this monster, as the most pure representative
of the Christian faith.' M. Cartigny himself
though a person of strong religious feelings, I found
to belongs to the sect of Unitarians sometimes called
Socinians. He was a man of excellent abilities,
great and various information, a most amiable
disposition, and as strict a sense of honour as I ever
found in any human being. We became extremely
intimate, and we afterwards met in his own country,
where he showed me much kindness and attention.</p>

<p>"For the rest, our voyage was prosperous; we arrived
in six weeks at the Port, and I found the day
after we landed that I could for a mere trifle obtain

<!-- vol 3 page 63 -->

a passage to Bordeaux in a vessel laden with fruit
from the Levant. I passed easily for an American
from the West Indies, and in less than a fortnight
I was landed safe and unsuspected, with a white
straw hat, long leather gaiters, and a calico jacket
and trousers, in the noble though crowded harbour
of that great and flourishing city.</p>

<p>"There is a feeling peculiarly strong, and mingled
of pleasure and pain, that rises in the mind
upon returning to our own country, after a long
absence. The Roman poet says, that every land is a
brave man's native country, as every sea is a fish's.
But I suppose the waters, like the land, differ, and
that the mullet rejoices more in our blue Mediterranean,
than among the sharks of the tropics. So I
felt more at home among the wine-peasants on the
beautiful borders of the Garonne, than among the
slave-drovers of the West Indies. I never, it is true,
had before been either in Bordeaux, or any part of
Guienne or Gascony, and yet I felt that I was now
at home. I once more heard the same language
spoken to which I had all my life long been accustomed;
I saw the same people; I resumed the same
habit of living. In a word, it was that home, the
idea of which is interwoven with all our strongest.

<!-- vol 3 page 64 -->

because our earliest recollections, and to which even
in our most prolonged, and our most distant wanderings,
we have often, unconscious of it ourselves,
been accustomed to refer whatever we witnessed, and
whatever we felt.</p>

<p>"I found, however, on the banks of the Garonne,
none of the relaxation of persecuting spirit which the
pastor of Nismes had taught me to hope I should
perceive upon my return to France; and I hastened
away from a city which appeared as much priest-ridden
as any great trading-town could well be.
Having often heard of the simple manners and
honest character of the peasantry in the Limousin,
I set out determined to find my way thither; and
M. Cartigny having lent me a small sum of money,
with but moderate expectations of repayment, I
contrived to travel so as to make it last me, till I
should be able by day-labour or in some other way
to support myself.</p>

<p>"I went by a diligence which carried me to
Limoges in an easy journey, the roads being very
good, and the country not uninteresting. It was
singular to find everywhere traditions of the dreadful
times when all Guienne was in the power of
England; and one could hardly imagine we lived

<!-- vol 3 page 65 -->

in the same country upon not one inch of which
now would a foreign flag ever be suffered to float
without causing rivers of blood to flow. They show
you at Chalus the spot where the English king,
Richard C&oelig;ur-de-Lion, was wounded by an arrow,
and died soon after; a prince whose valour has
made him the theme of universal admiration, and
the especial favourite of his countrymen, though it
was literally the only good quality he possessed, and
his ferocious nature resembled more that of a savage
beast than a man; a religious enthusiast, too, who
more than any other gave into the frenzy of the
times, and exhausted his kingdom by senseless
crusades, in which he, one morning, for the glory
of the God of mercy, and in seeking to rescue the
sepulchre of the Prince of Peace from its infidel
possessors, ordered five thousand hostages to be
massacred in cold blood. Limoges also has its
recollections of the heroism of those times, the
monuments of chivalry and its glories. The flower
of all knights, the Black Prince, as he was called
from the colour of his armour, whom all, even the
philosophical historians, represent as a perfect character,
getting angry with this town of Limoges
because it chose to declare for its old and rightful

<!-- vol 3 page 66 -->

sovereign, the French king, massacred three thousand
men, women, and children in one day. But
he was a knight, and valued knightly rank and
blood; therefore the knights were spared by this
discriminating hero in his horrible butchery of the
unoffending people. Could any one pass through
such scenes, recalling to his mind such recollections,
and not bless God that his lot is cast in other times?
We have now the unutterable horrors of slavery and
the yet worse slave-traffic; but we have long ceased
to glory in them; we have begun to feel ashamed
of them; soon we shall feel them to be unbearable;
and another generation will not pass away before
we wipe out so deep a stain on our character, and
relieve our consciences from the load of such enormous
guilt.</p>

<p>"When in scenes that recalled the vaunted age
of chivalry at every step, it was impossible not to
muse over the story of those times, and the extraordinary
hold which their barbarous institutions
took of all men's minds, a hold weakened, indeed,
but far from loosened, by the progress of a more
genuine refinement in after ages. I well recollect
the spirit of calm philosophy, in which my dear
friend. Father Jerome, was wont to discuss the

<!-- vol 3 page 67 -->

subject when we dwelt upon this singular chapter
of human history. Just towards all parties, and
charitable even to the worst errors, when errors of
the judgment they seemed to be and not of the
heart, he used to admit the natural effect of brilliant
exploits, their tendency to dazzle men by the noble
qualities of heroism, of contempt for suffering and
for death, which they displayed; and he seemed to
doubt if we should ever be so far reclaimed by
philosophy and religion, from this proneness to
admire such qualities, as to give them only their
due share of our esteem, and to see through the
false glare which they shed over base and cruel
actions. But he always held that the tendency of
chivalrous institutions to exalt these qualities had
been most pernicious. The false glare of mere
warlike virtue had thus been fixed and perpetuated.
The mind had become habituated to regard that
virtue as occupying the first place. Men's feelings
had been perverted, and their sense both of humanity
and justice enfeebled. Not only had the
merit of the peaceful virtues been undervalued in
general estimation, and the renown of deeds truly
beneficial to mankind obscured, but encouragement
had been given to war, both among rulers and their

<!-- vol 3 page 68 -->

subjects. The influence of chivalry in reforming
the manners of a barbarous age was not, he thought,
to be wholly passed over. But it must, he said,
be a very barbarous age which could be softened
or improved by such proceedings as those of the
Crusaders, and by the fantastic code of law, the
law of honour, which their times produced; while
one thing was, he affirmed, quite beyond all question,
that whatever benefit chivalry may in a remote
age have conferred on society, it had now ceased to
be of any advantage at all in its remains which, in
our times, were fruitful of nothing but inconvenience
and mischief."</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="small">FREE PEASANTRY.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">As</span> I now perceived nearly approaching the very
end of my resources, it was necessary that I should
betake myself to some employment for support. I
dreaded offering myself to any merchant or trader
in Limoges, a town of considerable traffic from its
central situation, both on the Bordeaux and Marseilles
road. It was not even very safe for me to
remain in a place where I might be exposed to the
chance of meeting persons from the Cont&acirc;t and its
neighbourhood. Recollecting with delight the conversations
I used to have with the holy and learned
friar on the singular eloquence of Massillon, I had a
great desire to visit Clermont, his see, that I might
gaze upon the pulpit he had preached from, and be
under the roof whose vaults he had made resound
with the thunder of his finished oratory. But the
country was extremely mountainous, though romantic,

<!-- vol 3 page 70 -->

and after setting out on this pilgrimage, I
changed my plan on reaching St. Germain, and
took the road towards Bort. I there found myself
in a perfectly rural situation, in valleys where the
primitive manners of the people had been invaded by
little refinement perhaps, but by no corruption, and
among villages where so few were assembled, that
all seemed as if in the country itself. I had never
lost the peasant's dress in which Isidore and I made
our first escape, after throwing aside the monastic
habit, and I now had resumed it on quitting the
diligence, and continuing my journey on foot. I
found no difficulty in lodging myself with a peasant
about three leagues from Bort, and never did I know
more amiable people in any station of life.</p>

<p>"The family consisted of the father and mother
and four children, of whom the eldest could help his
father, the girl assisted her mother, and the two
younger ones were left to the care of their grandmother,
one of the very kindest and gentlest creatures
I have ever known in this world. She gave
me the very idea of what poor Emilie Fonrose would
have been had her life been spared, though of course
much less elevated. No notion of self entered her
mind from morning till night, and even in the night

<!-- vol 3 page 71 -->

she would get up if she heard any noise in the room
where the children slept. Her anxiety was divided
between them and their father, whose health was not
robust, and who laboured above his strength, the
rather that the climate is severe in the Limousin.
The luxury of a fire at evening, one of the few we
enjoyed, was made most grateful by the piercing
cold which began in autumn and lasted till May. I
was there in the three earlier of the cold months.
The peasant's health made it desirable that he
should have help, and this was the cause of my being
engaged, at the very lowest wages, but with my keep
of course. A maiden sister of the peasant was the
only other member of this worthy family, which
lived in a state of union that knew no interruption,
and whose affection for one another really formed
the chief pleasure of their lives. Education they
had little beyond being able to read, and to write;
but the evening's amusement was, that while the rest
were working, one should read aloud some good
book either of piety, or of history, or of travels, when
any could be obtained; and the cur&eacute; was unwearied
in his kind attentions towards this and all the other
families of his parish, frequently lending them from
his small library such books as they could understand

<!-- vol 3 page 72 -->

and relish. The work of the women within
doors was unwearied as that of the two men without,
whom, indeed, occasionally they helped. Their
spinning provided the clothes of all; for except on
great occasions to purchase a little sugar and coffee,
or spice, and now and then a bottle of brandy, to
give a neighbour a little treat when he came to pass
the evening, there was no intercourse between the
cottage and the shops. The fare was wholesome,
and cleanly cooked, but of the most homely kind.
A pig was reared and its bacon furnished, the hams
being sold, nearly the only relish to our vegetables
which we ever tasted, unless when occasionally a
pigeon or a partridge, unknown to the lord of the
manor, might chance to be surprised by the son in
his rambles or at his field-work. Brown bread, with
coarse cheese, and occasionally lard to season it,
milk, the butter being carried to market, dried
apples and quinces on fast-days, on great occasions
a cup of coffee&mdash;as a more ordinary luxury chesnuts,
which were very fine, and which the good
grandmother had much skill and took great pride in
roasting, as she did in superintending the poultry,
which were all reared for sale. These formed the
humble fare of this most happy and most contented

<!-- vol 3 page 73 -->

family. I question if their ideas of indulgence ever
extended beyond what they daily, morning and
evening, devoutly thanked God for being permitted
to enjoy. I am sure they envied no inmates of a
palace their greater luxuries. The old woman
would, indeed, on showing the children the little
addition to their common meal which on a Sunday
or saint's-day she could dispense, devoutly draw
the moral how thankful they ought always to be for
their comfortable lot, sheltered from the weather
and indulging in dainty fare, while so many poor
people were exposed to the wind and rain, without
shed or clothes to cover them, and never knowing
to-day where they were to find the morrow's meal.</p>

<p>"But it was not with the mind's food here as
with the body's. Anything less coarse than the
texture of their hearts have I never known; anything
more refined than the sentiments their minds, as it
were, lived upon, I never anywhere observed. The
purest and most disinterested attachment to one
another, the most anxious desire of each to consult
the wishes of all, the most scrupulous regard of
every one to strict decency and even the most delicate
decorum, with the most unvaried sense of
justice in all their dealings, and the purest spirit of

<!-- vol 3 page 74 -->

charity in all their expressions towards their neighbours,
reigned throughout every branch of this primitive
and happy household. The father would of
an evening undertake to explain the difficulties that
might occur in the books they read or listened to;
and when he found himself unable to do so, he never
disguised his ignorance, but hoping his son might
one day know more, he promised to ask the cur&eacute;,
or the steward of the manor, when next he saw them.
The grandmother, who had in her youth lived in a
large town, Perigueux, would astonish and sometimes
shock the little circle with accounts of what went on
in such places. The sentiment then rose from them
all, 'Oh, how thankful should we be to live far out
of the way of such things!' The mother, too, was
a mild and gentle person, but melancholy preyed
upon her when she observed the declining health of
her husband, and the tears would fill her eyes as she
looked at her young children who might be left
orphans and unprotected. 'Dearest Matilda,' her
mother would say, 'trust in the Father of all mercies;
he may yet shield us from that fatal blow; and,
if he suffer it to fall on us, surely he that feeds the
wild ravens will have compassion on these innocent
little ones.'</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 75 -->

<p>"I am quite certain, and it is a reflection which
has often come into my mind since, and on which I
have never ceased to dwell with admiration&mdash;I am
certain that in the most polished society, in the most
refined age, there never were sentiments of more perfect
purity, never was a more unbroken delicacy both
of mind and speech, and manners altogether, than
prevailed in the homely dwelling of this poor peasant,
who supported his family with his own hands,
and that of his sister and children, and whose fare
was as frugal and indeed as little abundant as can
suffice to maintain life. Nor was this household an
exception. I found the other inhabitants of these
valleys persons of a similar description, not all possessing
as gentle and kindly dispositions, but all of
them equally uncorrupted, and all presenting the
same striking contrast between the hardness of
their lives and the tenderness of their affections, the
coarseness of their fare and the refinement of their
sentiments.</p>

<p>"No day ever passed over our head in this happy
valley, without forcibly recalling to my memory the
conversation of dear Father Jerome, and sighing, oh
how deeply sighing, that he was not here to find so
ample a confirmation of his profound and benevolent

<!-- vol 3 page 76 -->

doctrines. Among the numberless amiable, and, in
my sincere opinion, also wise, propensities of his
nature, one was eminent over the rest&mdash;the love
which he ever felt for poverty. It always seemed
enough to gain his affection that any one was poor;
a poor priest, a poor scholar, a poor householder, a
young man struggling for advancement against adverse
circumstances, a widow toiling to give her child
education, a brother labouring to support a sister
cast on his care&mdash;these were cases sure to touch his
benevolent heart, to excite his sympathy, and obtain
his help. But he had a speculative as well as
a parental love for those in narrow circumstances,
and he conceived that there was nothing at all to
connect poverty with any squalid or coarse associations.
On the contrary, he thought that the indulgences
of wealth were more likely to prepare for
the contagion of vice than the exhaustion of poverty;
that luxury, and even comfort, dispensing with work,
introducer of idleness, minister of the passions, is
greatly more a corruptor than want. However, he
would describe how easily, in his view of human
nature, the lot of the peasant and his poverty might
be united with not only the most kindly affections,
but with great refinement of mind. The culture

<!-- vol 3 page 77 -->

derived from education he conceived to be quite
compatible with a life of hard work, and if it was
also a life of hard fare, the risk was lessened of corruption
creeping in to taint its innocence, and debase
its worth by the worst kind of coarseness.</p>

<p>"But it was not merely from the exemplification
of his benevolent views in the Limousin, that I was
daily led to recall the good Father to my recollection.
He used to cite as a proof of his doctrine
the account which he had once received from Marmontel
of his early life. That celebrated writer
had then been for many years plunged into all the
dissipation of a literary, a theatrical, and a fashionable
life at Paris; but on a visit to the South, when
Father Jerome fell into his company, they had conversed
upon his original station, and the education
which he received, partly at Mauriac College, partly
at that of Clermont, when destined for the Church.
'It was plain,' said Father Jerome, 'that while revelling
in the enjoyments of Paris society, he ever and
anon sighed over the recollections of his youth; and
he described, with the most tender interest, his life
while in his father's cottage, surrounded only by
his family, and with much difficulty supported at
school. Marmontel was born at Bort, and the

<!-- vol 3 page 78 -->

valley in which I now lived was that where he had
passed the years of his childhood in simplicity, and
refinement of mind, but in circumstances as hard
as can well be figured. I felt, therefore, as if he
were now before me, showing the sad contrast
which luxury and success had produced, and as
if Father Jerome too stood by to resume his old
lessons on the happiness and the refinement of
humble fortunes.</p>

<p>"I found in these valleys the same desire of education
which had adorned them in the days of Marmontel.
My peasant-master, finding I had been
well educated, made me instruct his family; and
while I remained, they all, himself included, made
considerable progress in some of the common
branches of learning. He would sometimes with a
sigh say that his sons would perhaps live to be still
better informed than they were now becoming, but
that he should not be spared to see any material
improvement in their condition; only he prayed with
the prophet Agur that they might never know either
the extremes of great poverty or great wealth.</p>

<p>"The other peasantry of the neighbouring district
were in pretty much the same circumstances with
our family, and cultivated their own small properties;

<!-- vol 3 page 79 -->

but there were some farmers a little way off who
had considerable holdings under the lord of the
manor, and I occasionally went to see them on
holidays, accompanied by the peasant's son, whom
I taught in the evening. These farmers paid some
of them as much as between two hundred and three
hundred louis of rent, as they occupied their farms
upon the old Metayer contract of receiving from
the proprietor of the land seed, corn, and manure,
and accounting to him for half the produce. They
were of course in much more comfortable circumstances
than small landowners. But I was struck
and pleased with their simple and primitive mode
of life. The master and his farm-servants, as they
worked together in the field all day, he labouring
full as much as any of his men, so they all
dined together at the same table. The mistress sat
at the head, and her husband by her side, and
she carved the meat and distributed it among the
men and women servants, who all sat around, nor
was there the least difference in their fare. They
talked all as if on a footing of the most perfect equality,
and the harmless joke went round the table as
if all had been children of the same house. The
influence of the master over his men, and the mistress

<!-- vol 3 page 80 -->

over her maids, may easily be conceived. They
were in truth as the father and mother of the whole;
nor did any parents feel in the least degree anxious
or alarmed in entrusting their daughters to the care
of such a pair.</p>

<p>"These farmers, though much wealthier than the
small landowners with whom I lived, were not at all
better educated, nor had they more refined notions,
or a more interesting character in general. They
had none of the corruptions of luxury; but their
superior fortune did not elevate them above their
poorer neighbours. I was present at a f&ecirc;te, a kind
of merry-making, given in one of those farm-houses,
on the christening of a first child. Fifty or more
were assembled; there was a dance, with a collation
of fruits and dairy-dishes (<i>laitage</i>), and some glasses
of hot wine and water after the dance, while the
older men sate in an open space before the house,
smoking their pipes. There was much gaiety, and
no intemperance of any kind.</p>

<p>"The comfort and even pleasure which I enjoyed
during my stay in these peaceful and happy scenes,
I never shall forget. However long I may be permitted
to live, and with whatever classes of men I
may become acquainted, the Limousin peasant has

<!-- vol 3 page 81 -->

left a picture of rural innocence and humble refinement
that never can be effaced from my mind. It
raises my estimate, not merely of the peasantry, but
of the species, because it shows of what excellence
they are capable, even under the pressure of the
hardest lot. I never have since seen a man labour
in the fields, or looked at a cottage in the country,
without saying to myself 'How can I tell that the
same happy and virtuous minds may not inhabit that
homely farm, the same tender-hearted families may
not dwell under that humble roof, which I used to
delight in associating with, both while labouring
during the day or reposing at eventide in the valleys
of the Limousin!' If my heart leaps within me as
often as I see a peasant or a peasant's cot, as if I
saw a brother or a home, it is from the remembrance
of Bort, and the certain conviction that it
only depends on the upper classes to have Bort every
where around them.</p>

<p>"When I had been two months in the Limousin,
the beloved pastor, whom I had contrived to apprise
of my destination when I turned off from the Clermont
road, wrote to an address I gave him at our
town of Bort. This letter gave a melancholy account
of my poor father's drooping health since his

<!-- vol 3 page 82 -->

irreparable loss. It also inclosed a few lines from
Louise, in which she expressed the most hearty and
unaffected joy at my return.&mdash;'I will not be so proud
or so prudish, ' she said, 'as to conceal the extraordinary
delight which this most happy intelligence
has given me. Why should I? Are you not my
own dear love by every title and by all but every
tie? If this cruel separation must last for ever,
surely our minds at least may be united. And when
I know you are to read these lines, which my heart
pours forth upon the paper, and to read them in less
than a week, my spirit takes its flight as if it had
already left my body, and were hovering over my
dearest friend, to comfort, to support, and to protect
him. But, after all, must there be raised between us
an eternal barrier? Are we never more to meet?
Is your crime, which I never seek to hide from your
eyes or to justify in my own, never to be atoned for
by years of sorrow, by days and nights of repentance,
by the retributions which conscience exacts, by the
sufferings which divine justice inflicts? Can no
means be devised of once more bringing us together?
Oh! trust me with any project you can devise with
that blessed design! Fear not either my want of
prudence in acting on your suggestion, or of obedience

<!-- vol 3 page 83 -->

in following your orders, or of courage in risking
all that we may meet again. Think, ponder,
devise, and write, oh! write, even if it be to say you
can strike out nothing to comfort and relieve us.'</p>

<p>"This enchanting letter threw me into a rapture
which I do not think I had ever experienced before.
There was so much heart, such a noble spirit, such
a genuine love of me, and so firm a resolution, if
possible, to be mine, that I regarded the matchless
creature, perfect in mind as in person, endowed with
understanding equal to the spirit which animated
her, as something more than earthly; and as
I read her charming letter a hundred times over,
and laid me down smiling with joy at the recollection
of each tender and each warm expression which it
contained, she seemed to me something above the
standard of mortal woman. I have often observed,
both before and since, that there is nothing whatever
which more wins the heart of man, nothing
which more makes him beside himself in his passion
for a mistress, than her frankness in avowing the
mutual passion she is inspired with, and her bravery
in encountering all hazards for its gratification. This
courage too is very contagious. I felt ashamed of
myself while any remains of terror clung round my

<!-- vol 3 page 84 -->

heart, and froze it, when it should have been on fire
to run all risks. I went to sleep that night revolving
plans of immediate adventure, schemes for rushing
forwards and rescuing my Louise from her uncle,
resolutions to bring her off from Avignon at all hazards;
and the only feature of common prudence, or
even of any reflection, in the picture that my inflamed
imagination had conjured up, was the hope that, by
Louise going on a visit to Nismes, she and I might
more easily accomplish our escape to Switzerland.
But in the morning all was gloomy; the prospect
no longer smiled; the obstacles started up in every
quarter; the enemy appeared in all directions. Yet
the spirit of Louise's letter was enough to animate
the rocks and the trees that re-echoed its sounds as
I read it and repeated it without ceasing. How could
I continue to tremble and to draw back? Some weeks
passed in this struggle; all dangers were forgotten;
I wrote a few lines which I entreated M. Gardein
would convey to her. A fortnight after Christmas
I set out towards a more congenial sky than that
of the Limousin, and full of hope which laid all
fears asleep. My plan still was our escape from
France; and with this view I was to adopt a thick
disguise, and meet Louise at Nismes, where she

<!-- vol 3 page 85 -->

could go, as she had gone before, to visit the good
pastor.</p>

<p>"The trifling sum which I had scraped together
in the valley of Bort sufficed to defray the expenses
of my journey, and I trusted to the assistance of the
good pastor when I should reach his hospitable
dwelling. But it was not without a real pang that
I bade adieu to my kind and amiable host in the
Limousin. The excellent qualities of the family had
twined themselves round my heart, and had their
dwelling but been beyond the frontiers of France,
what more could I desire, than to seek shelter under
its roof with Louise, and there pass in peace the
rest of our days? The declining health of the good
peasant himself, whom I could scarcely hope ever
more to see, added to the melancholy of my parting.
But I was full of hope as of love, and all was forgotten
except the prospect before me, as soon as the
Rodez diligence drove away from Bort. We went
by Mauriac and Aurillac to Rodez, and I then took
another coach which went by Lod&egrave;ve to Montpellier,
from whence I could easily find my way on foot to
Nismes.</p>

<p>"At Nismes I arrived, the whole journey having
been passed in pleasing dreams, never to be realized,

<!-- vol 3 page 86 -->

but dreams which effectually chased all fears from
me, and all but made me forget the heavy blow
which had fallen upon our house since I left the
country. I purposely contrived my arrival after
dark, and I went at once to the pastor's house, with
a heart now beginning to beat from anxiety, of
which I had felt none on the way, all the future then
being steeped in rose-colour. The face of the servant
boy who opened the door, and whom I at once recognized,
though he knew me not, at once showed
my anxious foreboding of the last half hour not to
have been groundless, though it was imaginary.
The pastor was no more; he had ceased to live and
to love, to do justly and love mercy, a fortnight
before, and after a short illness had an easy passage
to his eternal rest and his rich reward. I made
myself known, and was shown to the remains of
that disconsolate family, who received me with the
affection that he would have shown, but, alas! could
ill supply the place of my deceased guide and instructor,
the father of my new birth, him who had
set me free from the heaviest chains that ever were
forged to fetter and to gall the human mind.</p>

<p>"I was unable, for the first evening that I spent
with this pious and amiable family, to enter upon

<!-- vol 3 page 87 -->

any inquiries as to the letter I had written before
I set out. But next morning I was sorely disappointed
by learning that the man of business who
had looked after the pastor's letters and papers, had
forwarded all those which he found intended for any
one else, to their destination, and that mine, having
arrived during his severe illness, had in all probability
been likewise sent to Louise. Soon I found
but too much reason to apprehend that it had fallen
into other hands than hers; for the pastor's granddaughter,
who was her friend, told me when I asked
if she had been lately at Nismes, that they expected
her to visit them in their affliction, but received a
letter from her, intimating that all intercourse with
Nismes was forbidden in consequence of a letter
which had been received by her uncle. The visions
which had been filling my mind for weeks seemed
at once to vanish. I could not think of making this
young girl the confidant of an attachment which was
disapproved by Louise's family; and nothing was
left for me but to make the desperate attempt of
going to Avignon, sending some one of whose discretion
and fidelity I must run all risks, to tell her I
was waiting in a cal&egrave;che outside the gate, and to
take the chance of her at once making up her mind

<!-- vol 3 page 88 -->

to quit the place and escape the persecution which
she was now enduring.</p>

<p>"The accounts I received of the Monastery added
little to my comfort in this emergency; for they
renewed my alarms for my own safety, as far as
the engrossing passion which occupied me would
bear any rival near the throne it had usurped. Father
Ambrose had a year before succeeded to the
abbacy; he had governed with rigour, though administering
its affairs with such ability as might
be expected from his well-known character; he
had used every severity which the law would permit
towards Protestants; and he had, ever since
Louise's conversion became known, directed his
measures in an especial manner against her, harassing
her by all the means in his power, and
openly taking part with her uncle, whose confessor
he had been, as well as her mother's, before being
raised to the head of the Convent. Her attachment
to me was of course well known; it had been proclaimed
by the exaggerating and perverting tongue
of slander, upon my escape; it was more fully and
truly made public by the rage of the disappointed
uncle. It seemed needless to add what, however,
I was also told, that the new abbot had by no means

<!-- vol 3 page 89 -->

abandoned all hope of discovering my retreat. He
had failed in Switzerland, and in Germany, and
ascertained that I had left that country; but he
never ceased to expect my return, from all the hints
which the close watch kept upon Louise and her
mother by the hateful uncle enabled him to gather
together. Louise never could disguise from her
parent the hope of our meeting, with which she still
flattered herself&mdash;and as this could only be by my
return to Nismes, that place was now to be watched;
and hence, even during the pastor's life, it had
become extremely difficult for her to visit him. At
his death she might have obtained leave to see his
family, had not my letter unluckily reached the uncle,
and through him stopped her going.</p>

<p>"The power of the clergy, I found, though it
had been exceedingly curbed at Nismes, and, indeed,
no longer extended to either a direct control over
men's actions, of any considerable influence in society,
was yet to all appearance as great as ever in
the Cont&acirc;t. Therefore, though I might be more safe
at Nismes, from all but the inquiries of the civil
magistrate, to whom I was, unhappily, as answerable
as ever; at Avignon I should be under the
weight of the double yoke, and had to dread the

<!-- vol 3 page 90 -->

laws of the church, as well as those of the land. On
revolving everything connected with our position,
the best course seemed to be, that I should take up
my abode near the town, in a cabaret, where I was
unknown. At one time, I thought of going to my
father's house; but it appeared that his declining
health since my mother's death had severely impaired
his understanding; and Mdlle. Gardein had
heard from Louise that he was in a state that made
it very doubtful if he should even recognise me.
The plan of going to the cabaret, and taking my
chance of forming some intimacy with one of its
inmates, who might be made serviceable to my
scheme, appeared, therefore, the preferable course.
It was full of risk; but some risk must be run in
every direction in which I could attempt to move.
This, therefore, was the line I chose; and I lost no
time in leaving Nismes for Avignon.</p>

<p>"In case my former disguise worn in Switzerland
should have been reported by M, Crenelle, Louise's
uncle, and in case any recollection of the peasant's
brown dress should be preserved from the
information of the farmer on the Rhone, who had
been examined after giving shelter to Isidore and
myself the morning after our escape, I was obliged

<!-- vol 3 page 91 -->

to get at Nismes a sailor's jacket and straw hat,
which, with colouring my face by means of walnut
juice, seemed to set all suspicion at defiance. I
slept at a village on the way not far from Beaucaire,
and on the following evening I got to a small inn,
near Avignon, used chiefly by carriers and country
people. Nothing particular occurred the first night;
but next morning as I lay in bed, I heard two men
who were sleeping in the same room, conversing
about a murder committed some years ago, which
roused my attention, though I did not let them see
I was awake. From the circumstances, especially
one of the men saying that the suspected person
had been secured at Nismes, and had escaped, but
was since known to be in Switzerland, I plainly
perceived, of what and of whom they were speaking.
Nothing could have relieved the agitation this threw
me into, but the gross exaggerations which they
gave of the unhappy catastrophe I had so much too
great a hand in. One was that Father Lunel (as
they called me) had run off with a nun; and another
that he had attempted to kill her uncle, when he
pursued them into Switzerland. When a murderer
remains undiscovered it is singular how the remembrance
of the crime is kept alive by the public impatience

<!-- vol 3 page 92 -->

that blood should atone for blood. As
soon as he has been found, and has paid the forfeit
of his crime, the curiosity and interest subsides of
itself. Till then every one seems to have a concern
as well as the law in the course of justice being free
and unobstructed; and doubtless every one has an
interest in it; for nothing more effectually protects
life than the belief that '<i>Murder ever will out</i>.'
Father Jerome used to think that cruel punishments
for this heinous crime were ill-judged, because they
made men's minds more savage and ferocious, while
the fear of punishment comes little into their recollection
when under the domination of the fierce
passions which in most cases prompt the perpetration
of the offence. As that is the season not of
calculation, but of feeling, he used to think that
more depended on the general habit of mind previously
formed, than upon the reasons suggested by
observation, and only to be weighed at cooler moments.
However, he admitted that a habit of fear
might be formed by constantly seeing malefactors
discovered, and if discovered severely punished;
though his principle was that example deterred
far fewer from the commission of crimes than was
generally supposed. Among the safeguards to life,

<!-- vol 3 page 93 -->

he used to dwell much upon the respect for the dead,
and even the horror of approaching or lightly dealing
with their remains. He thought that men would
much less shudder at spilling each other's blood, if
they were accustomed to treat their remains with
indignity, or even neglect: and he was wont to draw
from this consideration an argument that the funeral
ceremonies of different nations, even of barbarous
tribes, were not without their use in a moral view,
independent of their salutary tendency to promote
serious reflection.</p>

<p>"I walked out a little during the early part of the
morning, and made afterwards some inquiry as to
my distance from Arles, meaning, as I reported, to
join my ship at Marseilles. But my object was to
form some intimacy with a lad of eighteen, belonging
to the house. All I could do, however, was to find
that, without going into the town, I might hire
a cal&egrave;che, for a day, with a boy to drive me as far
as Beaucaire, where the diligence would pass next
morning. Seeing little chance of this boy being of
any use to my plan, I was sitting near the door in
the morning, when there passed a figure that at
once fixed my eyes; it was Louise herself, walking
towards the lime-trees which are on each side of the

<!-- vol 3 page 94 -->

Aix road. I knew not the young woman who was
with her; but she had the air of a servant. Letting
them pass, I followed till I could see they were in
a part of the road where no one else was walking; I
then came smartly up and passed them, moving on
till I could turn so as to meet them. When I came
near, I fixed my eyes on Louise, gave a smile, and instantly
saw that I was recognized. I was right in my
conjecture; it was her maid, whom she immediately
left, and joined me at a few paces' distance. I had only
a moment to bid her come to the last tree in the avenue
at six o'clock, when I should have a cal&egrave;che ready
which would easily take us to Beaucaire, and the
diligence to Aix would then enable us to get by Sisteron
and Gap to Dauphin&eacute;, and so to Switzerland.
The agitation of this meeting was calmed, or rather
supplanted, in us both, by the agitation of the plan
in which we were embarked. The noble girl made
no objections; she resolved to follow my all but
desperate fortunes; she agreed to meet me at six
o'clock; and I lost no time in hiring a cal&egrave;che
which should take us to Beaucaire.</p>

<p>"As the hour approached I began to feel uneasy;
but the cal&egrave;che was at the place appointed, and in
a quarter of an hour, which seemed a long night, I

<!-- vol 3 page 95 -->

saw Louise, attended by the same maid, coming
towards me. In an instant we were in the carriage,
she wrapped up in her cloak, and I keeping a look-out
to see if we were followed. We had hardly time to
express the joy we both felt at our separation being
at length ended by a meeting, though assuredly not
in very auspicious circumstances, when a diligence
overtook us; but it was not the one which travels to
Aix. We had therefore no chance of escape but
by waiting all night at Beaucaire for the Aix coach,
which was to pass early in the morning. At Beaucaire,
then, we arrived; and we sate for an hour
exchanging vows and congratulating ourselves upon
this happy deliverance. Never except the day I
received Louise's charming letter in the Limousin
did I pass so delightful a time as between our arrival
(the driver no longer being present to prevent our
speaking), and Louise's retiring to rest. But our
joy was darkened by a most untoward circumstance.
The driver coming into the room where we sat, to be
paid, bowed to Louise and saluted her by her name.
How were we, then, to prevent our escape from
being known all over Avignon next morning? I
tried what I could to prevent his returning till late;
but he would not listen to my proposals. We then

<!-- vol 3 page 96 -->

endeavoured to work upon his fears, and told him
that the Commissary or Governor would punish him
for having taken parties away without a passport.
It was all in vain; it only made him the more
desirous of returning; and he vowed to complain in
the inn if he was detained a moment longer. He
was therefore paid, and we immediately heard him
drive off. I could not avoid feeling uneasy at this
circumstance, but I endeavoured to make the least of
it with Louise, whose great anxiety had exhausted
her and made sleep absolutely necessary. I then
resolved, in case of any unforeseen accident, to sit up
all night in the room where we had supped, and also
that I might have her called as soon as the time for
the arrival of the diligence drew near.</p>

<p>"About six it was said to be nearly the hour; she
was in a short time ready, indeed she had only laid
herself down to sleep without undressing, in case of
the coach arriving earlier than its usual time. The
wheels we soon after heard, and with anxious hearts
we waited to see if there was room. Happily we
found two places and only two other persons, one a
lady, the other a military-looking person of about
twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, with a handsome
countenance, though shaded with black moustachios.

<!-- vol 3 page 97 -->

This I saw by the light of the lantern as
we were helped into the carriage by the inn-servant.
We soon drove off, though at a pace very
different from that which my impatience to be out
of the Cont&acirc;t would have desired. Having slept
none at Beaucaire, and it being still quite dark, I
fell asleep, and may have continued in this state
an hour when a great noise awoke me of voices
roaring out, and, more frightful still, calling my
own name. I was shocked again to hear the driver
ordered to stop in the name of the Holy See's
officers and authority, and to deliver up a party
charged with murder and sacrilege. I instantly
leapt out of the coach, and, snatching up a bludgeon
which lay near the driver, threatened with immediate
destruction any one who should dare to lay a hand
on me. I perceived the officer of police was
attended by another person, and from his figure and
the few words I heard him speak, I could have
little doubt it was Crenelle. Enraged beyond
measure at his presence, I sprang upon him and
secured him by the throat, when, my foot slipping
in the clay, I fell, bringing him down upon me, and
the policeman was in the act of securing me with a
rope, when the officer from the diligence seizing

<!-- vol 3 page 98 -->

the bludgeon that I had let fall in the struggle, felled
him to the ground with a blow, and extricated me.
He implored me to fly and take the road to Nismes,
as my life was gone if I hesitated. I felt as if in
his voice I recognised a well-known sound, and the
squeeze of his hand which immediately followed, at
once showed me I was right; it was the dear Isidore,
who had been at Avignon in deep disguise, and was
returning to Marseilles. I whispered that Louise
was the woman under my care, but he plainly intimated
that he could on no account be a party to
any further violence against his uncle, which M.
Crenelle was, as well as Louise's; and implored me
to take the only course left, that of allowing her to
return with him, and myself consulting my safety in
flight. With a heavy heart I communicated this to
Louise; Isidore gave him an intimation, but without
discovering himself, that he took at his peril any
proceeding against me. She accompanied him as
we advised; Isidore, again tenderly squeezing my
hand, promised to let me know what befel him
and where he was, but he was compelled to fly by
the same conveyance, having no small fear lest he
should himself be found out and followed. The
diligence went forward, taking him on towards Aix;

<!-- vol 3 page 99 -->

I got off the road upon an eminence where I could
in the dim light barely see a person's figure upon
the road; and as soon as I saw that Louise and her
uncle were gone back towards Beaucaire, I took the
road to Tarrascon, where I intended to wait till I
could in the night go to Nismes. Fortunately I
overtook a peasant who carried me in his car a good
portion of the way; and, after lying concealed in the
suburbs, I walked all the following night and reached
the pastor's house before daylight.</p>

<p>"You will perhaps wonder when I tell you that
all my love for Louise, my agony at our separation,
my alarm for my own safety, was nearly lost in one
feeling which now pervaded my mind, the delight
of finding my dear Isidore safe, and I hoped comfortable,
if not happy, my astonishment at the strange
chance which had brought us together, and my regret
at having seen him but for a few moments. His
generous devotion to me, his abandonment of all
care for himself, to which I now for the second time
owed my escape, dwelt on my memory as something
of a romantic kind. If any superior power had
given me the choice of being restored to his loved
society or to my Louise herself, probably when the
election was to be actually made I should not have

<!-- vol 3 page 100 -->

much hesitated; but revolving it in my mind as I
journeyed along towards Nismes, I hardly could
have decided which to prefer. In all my vicissitudes
I have known no truer friend&mdash;in all my wanderings
I have had no experience of a more single
heart in man, or a more loveable disposition.</p>

<p>"It was now necessary that I should at once
disclose to the family the danger I was in. Before
I arrived, reports had reached the place; but in
the course of the day these were confirmed; and
my attempt to carry off Louise, with an exaggerated
account of the violence I had used to her uncle,
made the whole subject of conversation at Nismes
in every place of resort. The certainty of my being
in the country without means of conveyance, and
my known connection with the pastor's family, made
suspicion certain to be directed towards that quarter.
Indeed, it was the very first place in which a search
would be endeavoured by the spiteful uncle, now made
doubly furious by the treatment which his person
had received, when I had with an effort upon myself
refrained from taking yet more signal and sure
vengeance upon him. It was absolutely necessary,
therefore, that I should immediately escape. The
Papal authorities could expect no kind of aid from

<!-- vol 3 page 101 -->

those of Nismes as far as regarded any spiritual
proceedings, or any punishment of offenders against
the ecclesiastical power. But unhappily there was
a graver charge against me of a civil description,
and to prosecute that the police of Nismes was
bound to lend its assistance. Once arrested, my
destruction was imminent, for I was undeniably a
subject of the Cont&acirc;t, and I must, in the ordinary
course of justice, be delivered up to be dealt with
at Avignon according to the ecclesiastical as well
as the municipal laws.</p>

<p>"After much consultation, it was resolved by Madame
Gardein, the pastor's daughter-in-law, to whom
the story of our attachment had been confided by
Louise, that she should disclose the whole circumstances
of my case to her bosom friend, the Marchioness
de Bagnolles, and implore her protection
for me. She hastened to the Ch&acirc;teau, and found no
difficulty in persuading so zealous a Protestant to
favour the escape of one whose offences, no doubt,
were secular as well as spiritual, but who nevertheless
could have been in no serious jeopardy had
priests never been. But the Marchioness was most
reluctant to involve her husband in the responsibility
of affording shelter to one charged with grave

<!-- vol 3 page 102 -->

offences. She justly observed that the same conduct
in this respect, which to a woman is easily pardoned,
because it is dictated by their compassion, might
in a man, especially of the Marquess's rank, wear a
less excusable aspect. It was, therefore, settled between
these friends, that I should take refuge in the
cave which was known to the Marchioness as having
afforded shelter before to an unfortunate priest,
the object of persecution for having changed his
religion, at a time when the power of the clergy in
Nismes was much more formidable than in the
present day. She contrived to make the place
more comfortable by causing the old housekeeper to
work at it for a few hours, and to carry thither a
sufficient number of blankets to make a tolerably
warm bed. In the course of a few weeks the cold
weather was sure to cease; and there was always
good shelter from the Mistral, the only cold of any
consequence experienced in this part of Languedoc.
I arrived the same night, and being secreted in the
room where we now are, I was early next morning
guided to the cave by the housekeeper, and I inhabited
it unknown and uninterrupted from that day to
the morning when you found out my retreat, the dear
Marchioness passing a part of most days with me

<!-- vol 3 page 103 -->

during the summer and autumn, and only bringing
me here when the cold weather commenced.</p>

<p>"These are my adventures; but on Louise have
I never more set my eyes since that dreadful night,
nor have I ever received any tidings whatever respecting
her."</p>

<p>Albert Lunel ceased, having now brought his singular
and melancholy history to a close. It left on
Chatillon's mind a mournful impression; above all
he deeply sympathised with the separated and persecuted
lovers, and he formed a hundred schemes for
rescuing Louise from the clutches of her hateful
tyrant, and restoring her to Albert's arms.</p>

<div class="center" id="v3ch04">

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="small">POPULAR CONTAGION.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> arrived a stranger at the Ch&acirc;teau, about
this time, who formed a most interesting addition
to its society. This was the Earl of Mornton, an
English nobleman of high family in Ireland, and
great accomplishments, a member of Parliament, and
holding a considerable office in the government. He
was intimately the friend of the reigning minister, and
by common consent was destined to take the highest
place among the statesmen of that country. Nothing
could exceed the elegance and suavity of his manners;
and, what gave him great success in French
society, he spoke the language altogether like a
native, but with a purity which not many natives
ever attain. He was a man of extraordinary classical
acquirements, being familiar with the ancient
languages and literature, above the measure even of
the most educated Englishmen. But his information

<!-- vol 3 page 105 -->

was general and it was accurate. Above all, his
political views were enlarged and sound. He had
deeply studied human affairs, and was a careful
and most anxious observer of the aspect which
things wore in France. At the period of his arrival
having come through Paris, his opinion of what
was then passing in the capital was naturally much
sought after by those whom he found assembled at
the Ch&acirc;teau, and in the course of the next day, the
Marquess naturally summoned M. de Chapeley as
well as others, to meet him. Catteau hearing of
this arrival, and eager to display his own importance,
and preach his own faith before so eminent
a personage, rather than very anxious for information,
made an excuse for calling in the morning, so
that the Marquess, to show Lord Mornton a sample
of the exalt&eacute; school of politics in Languedoc, asked
him to remain and dine with them. It appeared
that his lordship had formed the most gloomy
presage in, contemplating the issue of the present
crisis. Perhaps, from being less involved in the
deep game that was playing, he, a bystander, might
see more of it than those whose stakes were in the
pool. Certainly he was an alarmist, at the least to
the extent in which M. de Chapeley was alarmed;

<!-- vol 3 page 106 -->

as certainly his nerves were anything rather than of
the texture which M. Catteau affected to despise,
when he always from some such feebleness accounted
for any cautious or prudent suggestion,&mdash;a texture
which in fact, much more belonged to his own
nerves and those of his reckless associates than to
their adversaries, men of wise hesitation, and therefore
of true courage, whom he made a practice of
ridiculing and running down.</p>

<p>"The ground-work of my apprehensions," said
this noble person, "is the universal unsettlement of
all received ideas, and ancient opinions, which I see
to pervade all classes. Nothing any longer seems
sacred; no institution is beyond discussion of its title;
no opinion or principle is received as fixed and admitted.
All is uncertain, undetermined; all under
consideration and called in question, as if we were in
the woods of America; nay, much more&mdash;for, in the
new states of America, the principles of English
jurisprudence are held sacred; and even the principles
of the English constitution are received, though
under new names and other forms. But here, in
France, it is as if all things were set loose, as if all
was at sea, as if some wave were passing over the old
monarchy like that which overwhelmed the Old

<!-- vol 3 page 107 -->

World, and a new stratum were to be thrown up, and
when consolidated by time, to be the successor of
the one which had perished. I pray fire rather than
the great but slow innovator, time, may not be in
operation."</p>

<p>"I cannot," said the Chief Judge, "deny that of
the last forty or fifty years the writings of our philosophers,
helped by those of our wits, and by the
chat of our polished circles&mdash;for discussion one cannot
well call it&mdash;has produced a very great change
in the opinions and the feelings of the public. But it
has, of course, been unable to penetrate very low in
an ill-educated country. The bulk of the people
have not been materially affected by it."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," said Lord Mornton, "observe that
all influence, whether of sound learning: or of a worse
spirit, proceeds from the upper to the lower portions
of society. You at first impregnate the higher bed,
the upper narrow layer of the pyramid&mdash;thence the
next a little larger takes its colour from the contact&mdash;and
so the impregnation descends till it gets to
the broader stratum of the people. I don't at all
deny your position, that for the present, the higher
classes and the professional men, with the more considerable
merchants and bourgeoisie, are alone filled

<!-- vol 3 page 108 -->

with these new-fangled notions. But how long
can this last? The poison is too sweet not to be
eagerly swallowed; and in proportion to men's being
destitute of property, of stake in the country,
will be their eagerness to drink of the cup which
is to make them equal with those who have the
most."</p>

<p>"In that sense," said the Judge, "I agree with
your lordship's position; and, indeed, I am very
far from affirming that some progress has not already
been made towards the evil consummation which
you think you see approaching. Of this at least I
am certain, that if those above allow this move in
the wrong direction, the lower classes will be very
far indeed from offering any resistance. Nay,
they will much more probably be the first to join.
The peasantry alone would feel any repugnance,
but from their scattered position and their lesser
information, they will be as nothing compared with
the mobs of the towns."</p>

<p>"But in these circumstances," said the Baron,
"only fancy the madness of the Archbishop issuing
his mandate, inviting all the whole community
to send in their opinions, to print whatever
theories, or fancies, or vagaries they pleased on the

<!-- vol 3 page 109 -->

constitution and proceedings of the States General
just convoked."</p>

<p>"I was at Paris," said the Earl, "when that
began to operate, and the effect was magical.
The whole town seemed at once to have been
converted into a vast debating club. The corner of
every street was thronged with knots of politicians;
every wall was placarded with political addresses;
and the booksellers' shops were bursting with tracts
of all sorts and sizes, handling every point of political
doctrine. I believe, with you, that this spirit
is very much less diffused in the provinces; but I
assure you it is no light matter in considering your
present difficulties and dangers, that the capital
should be peopled with political agitators and a
political mob, while the rest of the country is comparatively
sluggish and inert. I foresee from hence
the tyranny of Paris over France, which really
means of the mob over the community."</p>

<p>The wisdom as well as the eloquence of the English
peer restrained M. Catteau for the greater part
of the evening; but someone arrived from Nismes
when they had left the dining-room, and brought
accounts of the Archbishop's sudden resignation and
flight to England. His last act, that of suspending

<!-- vol 3 page 110 -->

the payment of one third of the public engagements,
and giving bills at a year's date in security of the
debt, had operated most injuriously on the funds,
and was regarded as an act of national bankruptcy.
Brienne, in many things weak, was utterly inexcusable
in his flight, which left the Court to struggle
alone with difficulties his measures had first created,
at least seriously aggravated, M. Catteau was now
unable to contain himself. "We have, thank God,
been relieved from the old minister; the keeper of
the seals must follow his chief, and then"&mdash;"Why,
my good friend," said the Chief Judge, "you seem
to forget that M. Lamoignon has brought forward
the most important reforms which our jurisprudence
ever received, measures which are enough to immortalize
their author."&mdash;"As for his measures,"
rejoined Catteau contemptuously, "they are all
well enough in their way, and may be taken as an
instalment."&mdash;"Why really, friend," said the president,
"my lord will hardly believe that the reforms
you treat so lightly are the immediate abolition of
torture, and the universal improvement of our code
of laws, both criminal and civil."&mdash;"Well, well,"
said Catteau, "I don't deny that this is something;
it is an instalment; it is a sous paid of our debt, but

<!-- vol 3 page 111 -->

we must have the other nineteen of the livre."&mdash;"Catteau,"
said M. Chapeley, "this reference to instalments,
and your livre, is what I am daily accustomed
to hear, and you have no right to use the comparison;
for you will please to observe that you differ from
all other creditors; <i>they</i> have the sum of their
demand fixed, and when they receive an instalment
they let their debtor know fairly how much remains
due, beyond which he cannot be charged. You
have no such sum; your unit, your integer, is concealed:
and whatever you get, you pocket, making
it only the ground and the means of obtaining more,
while you never let us know the amount of your
whole demand. But this I will say, that the reforms
of M. Lamoignon are of the greatest value, and
coupled with the King's offer to give up the <i>Gabelle</i>,<sup id="r017"><a href="#n017">17</a></sup>
and the recommendation of the Notables to
abolish the <i>Corv&eacute;e</i>,<sup id="r018"><a href="#n018">18</a></sup> and the plan originating with
M. Calonne for imposing the taxes more equally,
according to the men's ability, form altogether such
a body of real substantial improvement as no
sweeping change in our constitution is ever likely
to obtain for the people of this kingdom."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 112 -->

<p>"My dear sir," said Lord Mornton, " I cannot express
how entirely I agree in the sound and wise, as
well as liberal, view which you take of these matters.
I am wholly with you (<i>J'abonde dans voire sens</i>).
How cruel the disappointment would be to all good
men and real lovers of their country, should we see
the substance of real improvement sacrificed for the
shadow of change, and this nation trying to obtain
remote and imaginary good from some untried system,
instead of seeking all the benefits they can get
under a better working of the old!"&mdash;"The old,"
said Catteau, "is rotten and worn out; it is good
for nothing; it can yield no fruit."&mdash;"Don't, M.
Catteau, mistake me," the Earl said, "I am decidedly
for amending it, in order that its better
working may be secured. In this principle I have
always agreed with Mr. Pitt, in whose zeal for
reforming our Parliament I cannot always concur;
but so far I approve his doctrine, that the foundation
of our popular government must be strengthened in
order to make the people sure of obtaining that
great end of all government, a good administration
of their affairs."&mdash;"Ah," said the Chief Judge, "in
your changes you happily have a foundation to build
upon; you already have an established representative

<!-- vol 3 page 113 -->

system; we have unhappily all to begin."&mdash;"I
quite agree with you," Lord Mornton said, "and I
never was more annoyed, and even disgusted, than
with the remonstrance of the 11th of April, in which
your Parliament, with a preposterous affectation of
antique lore, pretended to show that under all the
three races of its monarchy, there had always been
a control over the legislative power of the Crown;
perverting known facts, inventing checks, and after
all leaving the nomination of the controlling body
in most cases to the sovereign. It is a puerile
document, wholly unworthy the grave body which
issued it, and as deficient in honesty and good faith
as in statesmanlike qualities&mdash;I should rather say,
all other statesmanlike qualities. No, no, as you
say, all is to begin unfortunately."</p>

<p>"Why, instead of regarding this as a misfortune,"
M. Catteau replied, "I rather rejoice at
it. Heaven be praised that we have nothing to
hamper and restrain us. We have the ground all
cleared away for a new building, and may suit our
taste in the plan. See if we don't raise a magnificent
castle to lodge freedom in."&mdash;"I pray," the
Judge said very seriously, "you may not dig a
dungeon for the free."&mdash;"What," asked Catteau,

<!-- vol 3 page 114 -->

"do you think we are to be duped at this time of
day with your <i>Cours Pl&eacute;ni&egrave;res</i>, with the mockery
of a constitution lately attempted to be palmed upon
us, and merely to suspend the Parliaments and
enable the King to break his promise of convoking
the States?"&mdash;"Why, certainly not," M. Chapeley
replied, "I am as far from approving that measure
as you can be yourself. It was anything rather than
a wise one. The <i>Cour Pl&eacute;ni&egrave;re</i> was to be, both in
its structure and its functions, a mere tool in the
king's hands; to be composed of the princes, prelates,
marshals, and other grandees, with only twelve
deputies from the Parliament, all the others to be
nominees of the Crown&mdash;while the meeting of this
new Assembly of Notables, for it was nothing else,
was to depend on his majesty's pleasure."&mdash;"I don't
imagine," said the Englishman, "there ever was a
much greater blunder committed than this scheme,
which, with all the mysterious secresy employed to
wrap it up, was prematurely discovered, and when
made known really seems to have done more towards
aggravating the existing ferment than any other
move of the ill-fated and worse advised Court. One
thing must ever be borne in mind during such a
crisis as the present. If you mean to allay the discontent

<!-- vol 3 page 115 -->

by concession, by travelling in the direction
of the movement party, either you must go a good
way towards that purpose, or you may lay your
account with increasing rather than stemming the
mischief. But anything flimsy, colourable, and
even betraying sinister designs, only increases the
evil; it exasperates, by raising a doubt of your
good faith."&mdash;"I could not, however, have expected,"
said the Judge, "that this would make the noblesse,
even the clergy, take part against the Court. Think
of a remonstrance signed by forty-seven peers and
bishops, and in the King's present extremity! These
are but gloomy signs of the times, my lord."&mdash;"They
tell me," said Catteau, with visible exultation, "that
the feelings of the Parisians, down to the lowest
mob, are exceedingly strong. The whole town
seems moved with political ardour, and we surely
shall see all old abuses shaken to pieces."&mdash;"Beware,
M. Catteau," Lord Mornton said very seriously,
"beware how you place the pruning-knife
to lop off abuses in the thousand hands of the mob,
whose many heads are proverbial, and amount not
in the whole to one."&mdash;"Why, really, one would
think. Milord, that in your free country the maxims
of some canting moralists, theological optimists,

<!-- vol 3 page 116 -->

were the rule of the state; and that you held whatever
is, is right."&mdash;This sally was delivered in a
tone to show that one person at least of the company
was very abundantly satisfied with it. But
his contentment was not of long duration. "Why,
truly so," said the Earl. "But I should suppose
there is another country where certain of its inhabitants
hold that whatever is, is wrong, and, possibly
as a practical inference whereon to ground their
cause, add another maxim, that whatever is not,
ought to be."&mdash;M. Catteau showed little mind to
prolong the discussion, and soon afterwards retired
to join his club at Nismes, and to brag of having
silenced an English aristocrat.</p>

<p>The English noble was not merely a statesman,
an orator (as unfortunately all English statesmen
must needs be), and a fine scholar; he was the
delight of polished society; for beside the charm of
captivating manners, and of the greatest personal
beauty, he possessed a wit that never failed, never
tired, never exceeded the bounds of perfect propriety
and good taste, nor ever mixed itself with gall any
more than it ever ran to coarseness. He was also
fond of society, and devoted to the fair sex. It is
not wonderful then that he was attracted by the

<!-- vol 3 page 117 -->

Countess, and her first impression upon him, both
by her brilliant form, and her superior talents, could
not be otherwise than powerful. But it was of short
duration. Her hardness, her coldness, her selfishness,
soon pierced through her charms; and altogether
disinclined his lordship to swell the crowd of
her devotees. He had a notion of which he never
could divest himself, as he said in discussing the
matter with Ernest whom he had known in Paris.
"I will fairly own," he said, "that of a cold woman
I always have my suspicions. The heat exists somewhere;
and if not in the right place, it will break
out in the wrong."&mdash;"Whereabout," said he, "do
you imagine it burns in our fair friend?"&mdash;"Why,
where but in her temper? I feel as certain as if I
had seen her provoked, that that woman can be
easily thrown off her guard."&mdash;"You had better
not try the experiment," said Ernest.&mdash;"But, my
good friend," the Earl answered, "I should not so
much mind mere hot temper; it is not very becoming,
but in a woman it is not dangerous. My
fear is that your cold and hard woman has worse
faults. She is in an unnatural position; she is masculine
without our firmness, and is apt to have the
bad parts without the good of our sex. Besides, has

<!-- vol 3 page 118 -->

her ice never melted, her hardness never been
mollified?"</p>

<p>"Why, I have sometimes thought," said Ernest,
"the Baron had a chance. Assuredly she laid him
prostrate at first sight. No sooner came he in view
of Mont Blanc, than he seemed to have sworn that
he should either scale this unapproachable eminence,
and thaw this eternal glacier, or perish in the attempt.
That, you know, even your snow-woman
holds for something&mdash;takes in extreme good part."</p>

<p>"But how did she and he go on? I suppose she
relished him?"</p>

<p>"As who does not? His various learning; his
brilliant wit; his drollery, for it now soars to the Attic
heights and now sweeps the Doric levels; his grave,
serious even severe, though God wot never ascetic
moments; his liveliness, alternating with sarcasm,
like the clouds which course along the sky, now
hiding and now revealing the sun, now screening us
from his glare, and now descending in tempests of
thunder&mdash;all this must have made a strongish impression
on a very clever woman, though he has absolutely
none of the qualities which win the ordinary
female mind; he is plain, nay, as near being ugly as
any intelligent countenance will allow; he sings not,

<!-- vol 3 page 119 -->

plays not, paints not, dances not; he neither hunts,
nor hawks, nor shoots; he gambles not; and he
dresses so that, were he to appear in our <i>salons</i> at
Paris, he must either serve a long noviciate, or attain
high station, or make some happy hit that all can
talk about&mdash;else success he never could have; add
to all which, manners, though high enough bred, yet
abrupt, a temper not under strict control, and as
much pride as falls to one man's share."</p>

<p>"Is he amiable in other respects?" asked Lord
Mornton; "for somehow he holds himself so much
aloof, that the more one sees of him, the less one
knows of him."</p>

<p>"Amiable it is quite impossible any one can be
with his hot temper, and the sin raging in him without
control whereby our first parents fell. But he is
also revengeful, and I should say could forgive more
easily than he can forget."</p>

<p>"Do you hold him selfish?"</p>

<p>"In the utmost sense of the word. I don't mean
to say he is incapable of generosity; he is of course
generous, because he is proud and cannot stoop
to reckon pounds, shillings, and pence (<i>louis et
livres</i>). He is munificent by force of being magnificent,
would give to deserving objects rather than

<!-- vol 3 page 120 -->

to others, but must give to some, that he may be
above counting cost, and also make men feel grateful
and dependent. But I think he despises, perhaps
hates, all he confers favours upon."</p>

<p>"Is he a religious man with all this?"</p>

<p>"Why, he is a good Catholic, if you will, and I
dare say condescends to bow at church, which he
never will do at any earthly court. But as for religion,
his share of it would I believe lie in a nut-shell."</p>

<p>"And yet, with all this, you tell me two odd
things&mdash;he is devotedly fond of his niece, wholly
wrapped up in her; and he is admired and liked, perfectly
unamiable as you paint him, by a woman
of such strong sense and vehement nature as the
Countess."</p>

<p>"As for his niece, no doubt he concentrates all
his tenderness in his love of her, who adores him;
but as for as the Countess, it is her kind of nature
to take a fancy no one else would, and by dint of his
industry and his wit, he seems extremely to resemble
an amiable person. They are not unlike in
this; they are both fine to look at from a distance,
like bright thistles set round with tearing thorns."</p>

<p>"But, M. Deverell, let me say, I have been wonderfully

<!-- vol 3 page 121 -->

struck with his young niece. I had a walk
on the terrace with her before dinner, and, though
I had heard much of her from the Marchioness,
I never was more pleased or more surprised. She
possesses extraordinary powers, and her manners are
as delightful as I ever yet saw in any person. What
a relief from Madame de Chatillon's hardness, all
handsome as she is, to repose upon the sweetness of
Mdlle. de Moulin!"</p>

<p>"Aye, that you may well say," exclaimed Ernest,
with more enthusiasm than could have been expected
from a Parisian muscadin, only that he
really was above that caste.&mdash;"She is, indeed, truly
admirable. I believe a more delightful being
never animated mortal clay. Her genius is, as
you perceive, extraordinary, and it is not confined
to one or two walks. She writes beautiful
verses, full of the finest imagination, chastened by
proportionably severe taste. Her quickness of apprehension
is almost more than human; but her
judgment, tender as are her years, is the most
true, the most unerring, insomuch that my aunt
tells me she can consult her upon any difficult
point of conduct, with the certainty of obtaining
sound and useful advice; and I know her uncle

<!-- vol 3 page 122 -->

constantly relies on her opinion, even in the most
weighty matters."</p>

<p>"With all this, which is strange," said Lord
Mornton, "her feelings seem sufficiently lively; and
yet do they not warp her judgment?"</p>

<p>"Lively they are," he answered, "and even to
acuteness, yet her judgment is calm and unruffled;
her mental vision never obscured; her decision never
warped by them. She is the most affectionate creature
alive; and with a natural impetuosity of temper,
she yet continually keeps it under restraint, as if distrusting
herself, and would feel agony were she in
any sally of it to give pain for a moment to any
human being; for her whole existence is devoted
to comfort those that love her, and help those who
appeal to her unceasing charity and kindness."</p>

<p>"I grieve to see," said his lordship, "that this
most lovely person enjoys but delicate health."</p>

<p>"Alas, she does," Ernest answered, "and she has
often told my aunt, that she reckons not upon length
of days. This, with her natural sensibility, has made
her profoundly religious; piety is as it were a part of
her very nature, interweaves itself with all her habits
and engrosses all her thoughts, yet without one
atom of harshness, or intolerance, or any of the other

<!-- vol 3 page 123 -->

features of fanaticism or spiritual pride. It only
guides, tempers, adorns her sweet and innocent life."</p>

<p>"Well really, M. Deverell, you speak with
warmth, if not with poetry, on this favourite
topic; I should have thought one of your habits
and experience the last person in the world to become
enamoured of a young person like Mdlle. de
Moulin."</p>

<p>"Oh, as for enamoured, such an idea never entered
my imagination; but I do assure your lordship,
it is impossible to live as I have done for a
couple of months in her society and that of her uncle
without feeling a deep interest in them, and in their
melancholy friendship."</p>

<p>"And why melancholy?" asked the Earl.</p>

<p>"Alas, it is his mournful lot to be wholly
wrapped up in his niece, and all the while to know
by how slender a thread hang, suspended as it
were between life and death, all his joys on earth,
all (as he has told my aunt) that makes life at all
desirable to him, and even gives it any interest at
moments when the storm of ambition is hushed, and
the passions of his nature cease to rage. He has
sometimes heaved a sigh after a life of quiet and retirement,
in which his existence might glide tranquil

<!-- vol 3 page 124 -->

and smooth, only occupied with cultivating Emmeline's
mind, helping her genius to unfold itself
in some divine work of fancy, and sharing the tender
affections of her kindly nature."&mdash;"And what
impression has all this gentleness made on the
Countess?" said the Earl.</p>

<p>"Why, at first none at all. She conceived her
to be a mere nonentity. Since her fancy has
been somewhat taken with the Baron, she can
better bear his niece. But it is plain they don't
suit one another; and Mdlle. de Moulin can't
at all affect a friendship or admiration which she
cannot feel."</p>

<p>"You say she writes verses?"</p>

<p>"Very rarely, but delicately and tenderly when
she does. She will, I dare say, if you ask her,
show you a slight kind of song she lately gave her
uncle on his complaining of his goddess's coldness;
she took the Countess's part and defended it."</p>

<p>"I don't much think she will let me have those
verses. Can't you manage to get me them?"&mdash;"Why,
they are not many, I think I can repeat
them. They run somehow as this. You know she
speaks and writes English almost as well as your
lordship does French.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 125 -->

<blockquote>

<div class="small">

<p>"You ask what profit is in love,<br/>

Graced with Platonic name,<br/>

When souls, like spirits from above,<br/>

<p>Then, Zio, say, in woe or weal,<br/>

What more can mortals gain,<br/>

Than doubling every joy they feel,<br/>

And halving every pain?</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>"Very well, very well," said the Earl, "but I
could mend them, though the innocent authoress
will not. It should be not 'Graced with Platonic
name,' but 'Where glows no fierce desire,' and as
you cannot say 'lambent fire,' for the rhyme it
must be 'heavenly fire.' "</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps," said Ernest, "you may be in
the right; I am no doctor in these matters. But
Mdlle. de Moulin would assuredly reject your
amendment."</p>

<p>Lord Mornton asked if she often amused herself
with writing verses. "No," said Ernest, "she
rather undervalues this accomplishment, holding it
good for nothing, because always sure to be possessed
in mediocrity. However, she has some pretensions
as a painter of still life. I will give you her
sketch of our Languedoc 'Summer Evening'&mdash;</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 126 -->

<blockquote>

<p>The sun's last dying rays now gild the scene,<br/>

<p>The lambent lightning gleams athwart the sky;<br/>

Each floweret spreads its sweetness through the grove;<br/>

The fire-fly glancing flits from bough to bough;<br/>

And wakeful turtle-doves breathe out their love.</p>

<p>The balmy air now scarcely stirs the leaves,<br/>

So justly tempered, that each sentient frame<br/>

No warmth, no chill from its soft gale receives,<br/>

But life flows on in smooth unbroken stream.</p>

<p>In this sweet season mere existence charms<br/>

The raptured sense&mdash;rapture without alloy;<br/>

'Tis calmest pleasure&mdash;but which ne'er can cloy.</p>

<p>The soul looks upwards in such hours as these,<br/>

While all the feelings to devotion move;<br/>

Each sense seems kindly lent us but to please,<br/>

And perfect wisdom breathes in perfect love.</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>The Earl expressed his favourable opinion of
these slight lines; but said that he still better liked
her judicious remark on poetical merit.</p>

<p>When the society of the Ch&acirc;teau met at breakfast
next morning, they found the important intelligence
arrived from Nismes that the King had,

<!-- vol 3 page 127 -->

after considerable hesitation, recalled M. Necker
to the government, and placed the control of the
finances in his hands, as it had been eight years
before. The joy universally excited by this great
event was described as unbounded; the new minister
was the idol of the people; their suspicions of
the Court were dispelled; their confidence in the
King was restored; and nothing remained but for
the great financier to retrieve public credit, which his
wise measures and the belief in both his skill and
integrity promised would speedily be done, and to
prepare for the meeting of the States next spring.
It was further stated that the new minister prefaced
his acceptance of the seals by a condition, the theme
of general praise, that he should serve without any
salary or emolument whatever.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Count, "I should like much to
hear what the Chief Judge says on this event; and
also Lord Mornton's opinion; but he rises late, I
think."&mdash;"Yes," said Ernest, "his health is delicate,
and he is going to pass the winter in Italy to recruit
it. But," he added, "I can tell you what M.
Catteau says, for I rode over to Nismes early and
met him at the post-office, when the intelligence
from Paris was announced. He said that this made

<!-- vol 3 page 128 -->

all secure, for the Court and the King were beaten,
and Necker was a republican at heart, and, if not,
was too feeble to resist the sovereign people."</p>

<p>"And did you make no remark on such an ungenerous
return for the King's great goodness?"</p>

<p>"No," said Ernest, "but M. de Balaye, who was
standing by, did. He said, 'Catteau, you and your
party will not end before the streets of Paris run
with blood.' "</p>

<p>"Well, of course he protested and denied."</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing of the kind: he said, 'Why, for
the matter of that, we have some need for bleeding
at Nismes as well as at Paris. But be comforted,
Balaye, it won't be your blood or mine that will
run; it will be the pure aristocratic liquor, of
which they have so much that they can well spare
a little."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said the Marquess, "then M. Catteau
never more darkens my door; of that be assured.
I had formerly thought only of his violence and his
folly. He now appears to me in a more odious
light, and I believe from other indications, that
here are at Nismes, as the Baron lately found in
Orange, and elsewhere on his journey, persons of the
most fierce and even sanguinary dispositions, ready

<!-- vol 3 page 129 -->

to turn whatever may happen to the most violent
account."</p>

<p>Lord Mornton having entered the parlour, and
taken his seat under the book-case (for he had
breakfasted in his own room), laid down the book
which he had opened, and joined the company at
table. He expressed his reprobation of this Catteau
and his bloodhound pack, as he termed the party
with a vehement eloquence which shook those who
heard him, and made them believe all that had
been said of his great talents for public life. "But,"
he said, "there is unhappily one remark of this
cannibal lawyer which is too well founded. While
he, and such as he, are aspiring to lead, and while
the populace of Paris, and perhaps of other great
towns, are so ready to follow, assuredly a firmer
hand than M. Necker's is wanted to govern France.
These mischief-mongers are already reckoning on
his pliancy, and, as Catteau said, his heart, even if
not republican enough for their wishes, is not stout
enough for such a crisis as the present." The Baron,
who knew that excellent man personally, bore ample
testimony to his pure honour and amiable qualities.
"We want more for a public man;" the Earl said,
"that is the best foundation, but we must build

<!-- vol 3 page 130 -->

upon it."&mdash;"I believe," said the Baron, "that his
political integrity is equally without a stain. Nothing
can be more disinterested than his whole conduct
when last in office, and he has begun, we see,
his new reign with a noble act, the refusal of all
emolument to himself."&mdash;"But," said the Earl,
"even integrity will not now suffice. We must
have a firm pilot to weather the storm, as well as
an honest master above all design of playing falsely
with the owner and cheating the underwriters."&mdash;"I
much question," the Marquess said, "the wisdom
of this same refusal of salary. M. Necker, who
made his five or six millions as a banker, can well
afford to serve for nothing. He has no right to
impose a like condition on those who are without
his means, no right to put them in the dilemma
of refusing to be generous and disinterested, or
confessing to be poor."&mdash;"I rather differ with you
there," said Lord Mornton; "in general what you
say is quite true and just; but mark that the
present is eminently a financial crisis, which will
require the greatest saving in all departments, and
in my opinion M. Necker has done well in arming
himself with the power to retrench all salaries, by
refusing to take any himself. But for this consideration,

<!-- vol 3 page 131 -->

and regarded as a mere boast, a measure to
gain public confidence, I should have despised as I
should any other popularity-trap."&mdash;"However,"
said the Baron, "I entirely agree with your lordship
in the opinion that more is now wanted than even
the strictest public virtue. Courage of the highest
order, moral courage, the boldness to face difficulties
of the worst and most opposite kind, the resolution
to act on a sound system, regardless of the people
when you differ with them, nay the determination to
encounter the utmost hatred, if need be, of those who,
while they moved in the right direction, you most
cordially joined; this is absolutely necessary now,
and without this my Genevese friend will do
nothing."&mdash;"I wish," said the Marquess, still hankering
after his former opinion, "we may not pay
dear for his disinterestedness. The amount of that
salary which now intoxicates our countrymen, may
prove to be very dearly purchased. Pray, Baron,
what are his views respecting the States? He must
have long since made up his mind upon the great
points of discussion, and be prepared to act on his
own views?"&mdash;"He has," the Baron said, "a fixed
determination on one of the questions; on the other,
he has not at all made up his mind. He will, I am

<!-- vol 3 page 132 -->

sure, determine in favour of allowing the Commons
(<i>tiers &eacute;tat</i>), a number of deputies equal to those
of the Nobles and Clergy united. The question of
the three States voting apart or together, the real
question of moment, he will leave to be determined
when they meet,"&mdash;"Why," said Lord Mornton,
"there is absolutely not even common sense in this.
To what purpose give the Commons a double representation?
Unless the three are to vote together,
what can it signify how many deputies go to form
the single vote of the tiers etat on any measure?
No, no, depend upon it this Genevese literateur
means that they shall sit together, but, not daring to
propose it, he will give the one such a numerical
force as may compel the others to join them; and
then the same force will carry whatever the Catteaus
please to propose."</p>

<p>The opinion thus entertained was combated, and
feebly, by the Marquess remarking that the Archbishop's
ordinance for constituting provincial assemblies,
in order to make head against the Parliaments,
obliged M. Necker so to shape his course, because it
had both given the third estate a number equal to
the other two in those bodies, and had intimated the
plan of voting individually together, and not in separate

<!-- vol 3 page 133 -->

chambers, each of which should have one voice.
But Lord Mornton justly made answer that the importance
of these assemblies was as nothing compared
with that of the States General, and that what
possibly was even in their case a great error, could
receive no excuse from the precedent when applied
to the representation of the whole kingdom. "I
own," he said, "that my fears are great of the end
to which all this may lead. If the violence of
miserable unprincipled men, joined by those who
always become the dupes of such leaders, the sincere
and well-meaning, but wrong-headed, enthusiasts,
shall succeed in gaining the mastery, with the base
mobs of the great towns, and above all of Paris, to
be the instruments of their mischief, I foresee nothing
but ruin to this noble kingdom. A reign of mob-tyranny
will lay waste the country; and you will
end by having a much worse government established
than any you now complain of, after passing through
the most intolerable tyranny of all&mdash;that of the multitude.
The Catteau murderers will be the sacrifice
of their own wild and wicked schemes; but unhappily
the worthy will fall with the vile; and, instead
of gaining by the convulsion, you will end far worse
than you began. Believe me, if there be a truth

<!-- vol 3 page 134 -->

more sound than another in the science of government,
and in that of human nature, it is this&mdash;that
the people who hasten to improve their political lot
faster than the safety of society permits, are as sure
of going wrong, and coming to a bad end, as the
individual who makes haste to be rich. Anarchy
and slavery await the people, as the gibbet awaits
the man."</p>

<p>The accounts from Paris, in letters received at
Nismes, represented the temper of the people as
extremely unsatisfactory. There was every indication
of a disposition to excitement; the alarm was
increased by the unpromising prospect of the harvest;
and all who considered the subject at the Ch&acirc;teau felt
disposed to take Lord Mornton's view, that the new
minister was by no means the pilot required to weather
the gathering storm. "I never," said his lordship,
"could have so high an opinion of him after
his resignation in 1781, as I had been inclined to entertain
before. His first administration was marked
certainly by great financial skill and unsullied integrity.
It also showed great and perilous coveting
of popular applause&mdash;a rock in every statesman's
course, and to be carefully avoided. But when he
refused to remain and preside over the execution of

<!-- vol 3 page 135 -->

his own plans, and refused at a moment of great
embarrassment for the King's service, as well as for
the country, and retired merely because the jealousy
of Maurepas, the prime minister, refused him a seat
in the cabinet; probably, too, because he conceived
the attacks through the press were encouraged by
that colleague, I perceived, if not a man of little
mind, certainly a second-rate man. It savoured of
the petty, pedantic, self-conceited, Geneva character."&mdash;"I
go along with you so far," said the Baron,
"that I always considered this resignation to be the
worst passage in my friend's public life. Yet it must
be admitted, as to the libels which you mention, that
the conduct of M. Maurepas was wholly inexcusable.
There is not the shadow of a doubt that he set on
the slanderers, and his agent was neither more nor
less than Ste. Foix, who held a household place at
court. M. Necker thought that his credit in the
country, and consequently his power of serving it,
was gone, if the King did not show his countenance
and support of him by the mark of favour which was
made a condition of his remaining in office. You will
admit, too, Milord, that the minister who at such a
season of difficulty had the whole weight of our shattered
finances on his shoulders, being refused a place

<!-- vol 3 page 136 -->

in the council which had to decide questions of peace
and war, and commercial treaties, was an absurdity
without example."&mdash;"That," his lordship said, "I
don't deny; I only say, first that M. Maurepas was
eighty-four years old, and that had M. Necker
remained a few months he must have succeeded him
as prime minister; next, that he was very ready to
suppose his dislike of abuse merely originated in the
dread of losing his power to serve the country. He
lost that power much more effectually by retiring
and letting the finances be mismanaged for seven
long years. I have seen his correspondence, and
that of his daughter, upon his lately taking office.
I found in one of the letters an anecdote given in his
praise,&mdash;that on receiving the news of his restoration
to power he exclaimed, 'Oh! had I only the Archbishop's
fifteen months! But now it is too late.'&mdash;And
why too late? Because he went out and let
in first Calonne and then the Archbishop."&mdash;"Do
you believe he offered his daughter, Mademoiselle
Necker, in marriage to your friend Mr. Pitt?" said
the Countess.&mdash;"I am sure of it," he answered, "and
a little bit of official pedantry made the offer the
more ridiculous. He being at the head of the French
treasury, Mr. Pitt of the English, the proposal

<!-- vol 3 page 137 -->

went through neither more nor less than Mr. George
Rose, the worthy secretary of the treasury in England."&mdash;"When
you call the proposal ridiculous,"
she answered, "are you aware of the extraordinary
qualities and accomplishments of Mademoiselle
Necker, independent of her being the richest heiress
in France, perhaps in Europe? Any man, be he
your minister himself, might have been proud of
such a match."&mdash;"Why, Madam," said his lordship,
"I am sorry, and it was wrong, that I spoke slightingly,
even in appearance, of any proposition in which,
Mademoiselle Necker was concerned; for I hear
from all quarters that her talents, spirit, and information,
are of the highest order. But I was
thinking of Mr. Pitt rather than of her: he is not a
marrying man at all; less so, I may say more the
reverse of it, than any one I know; and as for money
I am sure all the wealth of Peru would never make
him listen to a proposal which on other accounts he
might wish to decline."&mdash;"I will add," said Ernest,
"that much as her fortune might edify, and her
talents charm me, I would give up half the one and
all the other for a moderate addition to the stock of
beauty which at present stands in Mademoiselle
Necker's name."</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="small">VARIETY.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the custom at the Ch&acirc;teau to invite on the
Saturdays a larger number of guests than usually
composed the society. There was no general invitation,
which so near a large town would have been
inconvenient, especially as party and sect greatly
divided the inhabitants of Nismes. But it was a
day which pretty certainly brought together a considerable
party; and therefore, the young, the women,
the literary men, and those ambitious of display in
any manner, much enjoyed being asked to the party
which agreeably closed the weekly labours of the
one class, and the amusements of the other.</p>

<p>But among those who liked to come on Saturday
was not M. Liel (called by the wits of Nismes
Fiel), who eschewed such assemblies, declaring that
the more of his fellow-creatures (who could, however,
in no wise be called his <i>semblables</i>) were gathered

<!-- vol 3 page 139 -->

together, he was sure to find the more folly and the
more baseness; and he, therefore, prayed the Marquess
to receive his respects on any other day of
the seven. It must be observed, that he so far rejected
the Nismes <i>alias</i> to derive his descent from
the Roman family of Lelius, one of the few things
he was vain of. But it was remarked, that if he
had the wisdom of his ancestor, it could hardly be
termed "<i>meek</i>" or "<i>gentle</i>" as Horace called his.</p>

<p>When Lord Mornton entered the room the second
day after his arrival, he found this singular character,
of whom he had the evening before heard from the
Marchioness enough to make him, a curious observer
of human nature, desirous of seeing him.
He perceived, perched in an obscure corner of the
library, where on that day the company chanced to
assemble before dinner, an elderly man of meagre
form, and a face singularly thin, and dried up, with
an expression that seemed to justify the Nismes jest
upon his name, and a kind of long opening of the
mouth, that could scarcely be called a grin, for it
was habitual, but could still less be termed a smile,
for that was no production of those latitudes. There
was nothing otherwise in the countenance at all ugly
or repulsive; indeed, it bore a resemblance to what

<!-- vol 3 page 140 -->

he recollected of Voltaire's. Much time did not
elapse before he had occasion to observe that the
accounts he had received of this person's misanthropy
had not been exaggerated; and that it was far from
having the disagreeable quality of other men's, for
it made not at all that exception, which their hatred
and contempt generally makes, the exception of
themselves, and what belongs to themselves.</p>

<p>The Count having observed that M. Duras's jokes
(a wit of the province) were somewhat far-fetched,
"They may be so," said M. Liel, "and I'll answer
for their not being worth the carriage."&mdash;"Is it
true," asked the Countess, "that he lives by his
wits?"&mdash;"Why if so, Madam, he must have but a
meagre table."&mdash;"I am told," the Marquess said,
"that he is an excellent man, very charitable according
to his means towards other poor authors, and
no one can find any fault with him that I can learn,
if it be not a certain bitterness of expression which
after all may mean no more than that it is his humour."&mdash;"I
am sorry I don't know him, and should
like to make his acquaintance," the Marchioness
said.&mdash;"Why, perhaps it would be better for his
reputation," said M. Liel, "that you should not,
after the fine character just drawn of him." The

<!-- vol 3 page 141 -->

Marquess had unintentionally come upon two sore
places with M. Liel; he had praised generosity and
censured evil-speaking (<i>m&eacute;disance</i>), his guest being
as avaricious as he was misanthropic, and regarding
any generosity in money as personal to himself,
equally with any generosity in praise. He therefore
boiled, or at least, simmered over, on the heat
thus applied to him.&mdash;"Why, Marquess, as for his
charities, how came you to know of them? Does
he blow a trumpet when he gives a penny&mdash;that
being all he ever has in his pocket? For my
part, I defy my right hand to know what my left
does; I keep both alike in my pocket, well knowing
that if they be not there some other person's are
sure to get in. Then, as to his evil speaking, it is
perhaps the thing he most deserves to be commended
for. He is honest, I suppose, and says what he
thinks of his neighbours; and if they would all
honestly say what they think of him, you would
call them evil-speakers also."</p>

<p>Lord Mornton was delighted with this original,
and still more when someone having mentioned that
Madame Leblanc, (whom he particularly disliked)
declared the evening party at the Pignerols' last night
to be the best of the whole season, especially with a

<!-- vol 3 page 142 -->

view to the supper, and that she foresaw they would
repeat it, after such success: "Aye," said Liel, "I
dare say we may foretel future events as our Roman
ancestors did, from the bowels of the swine." It
was said that there was no blame in the lady's being
fat, any more than in another being lean, and that
good-natured people generally are fat.&mdash;"But as she
can have no such title to her shape," said he, "she
certainly derives it from her gluttony alone. I
never knew such a compound of talk about the
spirit and concern about the flesh, in all my experience."&mdash;"Why,
M. Liel," said the Marchioness,
"I really always thought that you had been a religious
man, and wonder to hear you blame Madame
Leblanc for it."&mdash;"And who says I am not,
Madam? But if I were compelled, as a condition
of my devotion, to believe not only in religion, but in
those who profess it, my faith would be soon at a
low ebb. Religion gives me unspeakable consolation,
and, therefore, I hate hypocrites."&mdash;"Consolation,
truly," said the Marchioness, "we can hardly
be said to have any other in this world."&mdash;"I agree
with you entirely," he answered; "there is nothing
so much raises us above it, abstracts us so much from
it."&mdash;The Marchioness's face lighted up to hear

<!-- vol 3 page 143 -->

such edifying sentiments. "Oh, yes, well may you
say so! Well may you thus justly praise that grand
solace."&mdash;"Yes, Madam, it is my refuge from the
follies and the vileness of men&mdash;it abstracts me from
them&mdash;it frees me from their contact&mdash;it holds out
even the prospect of one day escaping from them
altogether, and seeing them receive the condign
reward of their conduct hereafter, which always
contrives to avoid meeting with its due in
this life."&mdash;"Alas, M. Liel," she replied, "I fear
these are not quite the sentiments a religious mind
should have."&mdash;"Madam, depend upon it that
the mixture of cant and mutual flattery is the
bane of our devotion, as it is of all social intercourse.
To meet together for the purpose of oiling over one
another, of muttering out praise of one's self and
one's neighbour, to use our gift of speech for the purpose
of concealing our thoughts both of others and
of ourselves, to encourage every one his neighbour in
all his weaknesses and all his wickednesses, by
praising the one as amiable, and depicting the other
as necessary&mdash;believe me all this is as foreign to true
religion as it is to common honesty."&mdash;"Well, my
good old friend," said the Marquess, "no one will
accuse you of such things, though I often think you

<!-- vol 3 page 144 -->

somewhat uncharitable."&mdash;"I hope and trust you
very, very often do&mdash;but I am not much better than
other people after all. I lately, as M. Deverell can
witness, saw a gentleman give a beggar a livre
piece, and I never even remarked (what I certainly
must needs feel)&mdash;that he did it either by mistake
or from ostentation. I said not one word, whatever
I might think."&mdash;"No, that you did not," said Ernest,
"and when I asked why you had not set the
gentleman right, your answer was, if he did it from
ostentation, you were only playing his game, and
you never could be sure it was not so."</p>

<p>A kind of ejaculation, in the nature of a grunt,
from M. Liel, testified the arrival of the Chevalier
in the library. His good-natured countenance, betokening
a spirit of contentment with himself and all
about him; and his hilarity, ever unbroken, with his
jolly humour, never venting itself in an ill-natured
observation that did not manifestly proceed from
mirth, and never was intended to wound, proved a
source of acute suffering to M. Liel&mdash;indeed seemed
to be a standing rebuke of him. The Sieur Gaspar
used to say that the two taken and used together
might make a good salad&mdash;the one being oil as
the other was vinegar. Before the time came, however,

<!-- vol 3 page 145 -->

for showing the Earl how impossible it was to
mix them together, the announcement was made
that the company were served, and they adjourned
to the dining-room. It soon appeared to what tune
M. Liel's politics were set. He professed his entire
satisfaction with the news that had last arrived of
fresh tumults in Paris, and of Necker having been
recalled amidst great popular enthusiasm. The Earl
ventured to hope that he did not partake of the joy
which these events had diffused among the Catteau
party. "But I do," said Liel. "Not one of the
vile fry is happier with it than I am. They are,
perhaps, more my utter detestation than any other
class of the people; and I am sure that after fulfilling
the object of their mission here on earth from their
native regions below, they will themselves be
thoroughly punished by each other before their return
home to their father's warm and commodious mansion."&mdash;In
his views of the probable result to be
expected from these changes, the kind-hearted old
gentleman did not differ widely from his lordship;
though he regarded their consequences with somewhat
different feelings&mdash;his being those by no means
of universal benevolence, though they so far partook
of rigid justice, that they were pretty equally favourable

<!-- vol 3 page 146 -->

to all descriptions of his fellow creatures.&mdash;"I
reckon the thing more than begun; I consider the
revolution as already settled," said he.&mdash;"Then,"
said his lordship, "you think it not merely begun,
but over."&mdash;"Over? Heaven forbid! I think it
going on, and on it must go; but I hope to see it
produce the condign punishment of all those classes
of this huge overgrown country, with its more disproportioned
aneurism of a capital, a false heart
beating away, morbid itself, and filling the whole
system with disease. There is scarcely one portion
of our vile generation that I do not hope to see
speedily suffer according to their deserts&mdash;perhaps
beyond them; however, I don't require that. I shall
be quite satisfied that they suffer according to their
deserts&mdash;that suffering will be sufficiently ample; it
will leave little to desire."</p>

<p>In the evening the company were agreeably entertained
by looking at the Prince Caramelli's last
drawings. He had not of late shown any, as he had
made some excursions, and wanted to finish his
sketches somewhat before exhibiting them. The
display of his pencil gave little pleasure to M. Liel.
His own love of natural scenery was strong, and he
regarded with jealousy all the attempts to represent

<!-- vol 3 page 147 -->

it on paper or on canvas. To some of the Prince's
sketches he objected their being obscure, and leaving
great doubts of what the different parts were intended
to represent. The style was, indeed, somewhat
dashy, and here and there a little indistinct. "That
rock," said Liel, "to the right"&mdash;"Excuse me," the
artist said, "it is a tree."&mdash;"I crave your pardon, I
took it for a rock;" and he fell into, or perhaps
rather made, other mistakes of the same kind; so
that he recommended to the Prince a plan which he
said would obviate all such difficulties. "I would
have your Excellency," he said, "take the trouble of
writing in the margin the names of the different
objects intended to be represented, and connecting
those names by a slight line with the parts of the
drawing. The engineers, a sufficiently accurate
race of men, always do so, and it saves trouble
and prevents mistakes." It was, however, said by
the Marchioness, in order to mitigate the Prince's
chagrin at these criticisms, that M. Liel did not
even much admire the great masters. "That I
really cannot allow," said Liel; "I do greatly admire
them&mdash;that is, as greatly as I can. Who does
not love to gaze on Rubens' colouring, and Raphael's
drawing?&mdash;though" (as if willing to eat in

<!-- vol 3 page 148 -->

the praise he had been unwarily drawn into uttering),
"I grant you there is as bad drawing in Rubens, as
there is bad colouring in Raphael; and indeed,
even as to colouring, who can quite stomach all the
crimson and purple of the Fleming's fat, flabby, coarse
and dropsical children, any more than their shapes?
or who does not see a hardness and statuary outline
in many of the Roman's figures, as well as a copper
and mulatto colour, making one think he had been
rather representing old Roman statues, which were
coloured, than living persons?"&mdash;"But," said the
Marquess, "all this is a decided point; we dare no
longer dispute the judgment of ages."&mdash;"No," said
M. Liel, "and because we are left bound on the
merits of those who are gone, must we forge fetters
for ourselves as to those who have no sentence to
produce in their favour? We come into the grown
up world with our minds chained by education, as
we come into life with our limbs swathed. Therefore
let us keep ourselves free to judge when we can. On
that maxim I act."</p>

<p>The Prince perhaps thought he might charm the
ear of this severe critic, though he had failed to
please his eye; and he began to hum a tune and
strike a few notes on his guitar. But unfortunately

<!-- vol 3 page 149 -->

a general expression of satisfaction among
the ladies showed that there was admiration
stored up, secreted as it were, and ready to
find vent: this M. Liel could not stand, and
he escaped to bed before any <i>bravo</i> could be
heard to grate upon his ear. He had the better
excuse for this that his maxim was to get up
with the cock and lie down with the crow, which,
according to the old proverb, is the secret of avoiding
the tomb.<sup id="r019"><a href="#n019">19</a></sup></p>

<p>The conversation, as soon as the music was over,
naturally enough rolled upon him who had been
driven away by it. "He is," said M. de Bagnolles,
"one of the strangest men I ever yet knew, and of
the most unsparing misanthropy. Nor does it arise
from misfortune, as is often the case; for his circumstances
are affluent; he has never known affliction.
But possibly living alone, and having always indulgences
within his reach, has brought him to
disregard whatever had no difficulty in the pursuit,
and to undervalue mankind, whom he knew perhaps
chiefly by bad report." The Earl remarked that he
seemed to deprive himself of much gratification by

<!-- vol 3 page 150 -->

his determination never to admire. "Why," said
the Marquess, "it is not true that he never admires.
He is enthusiastic in his love of nature. It seems
as if there was a certain fund of admiration in our
composition, and that, when denied an escape in one
direction, it finds vent in another. This delight
which he takes in natural objects is one reason why
he won't easily bear pictures affecting to represent
them, as you might see the other day."&mdash;"Has he
any relish for poetry?" the Earl asked. "I should
suppose little."&mdash;"Or rather none," the Marquess
answered, "but he is patient of it compared with
eloquence, which enrages him; he says it has all
the folly of poetry and its emptiness; it is poetry
under a false pretence; indeed he regards it as a
kind of personal insult; add to which his unconquerable
horror of lawyers and Romish preachers who
are the practisers we of France most familiarly know
in the rhetorical art. Our pastors read quietly and
impressively their discourses, and have none of the
action of the cur&eacute;s, which, he says, might save the
congregation an emetic. I have heard him say, that
some addresses are directed to the understanding,
some to the heart, but these oily ones go straight to
the stomach."&mdash;"How can he see the Maison Carr&eacute;e

<!-- vol 3 page 151 -->

and the Pont du Gard unmoved?" asked the Prince.&mdash;"Why,
as they are works of men he naturally must
condemn them; but then these men were Romans,
and he makes some little exception in their favour,
on account of his descent, which he firmly believes
to be Roman; so that he accounts it a kind of personal
or family concern, and says nothing against
them, if he says not much in their behalf."&mdash;"Has
he never shown any relaxation of his dislike towards
the species of the present day?" asked the Earl.&mdash;"I
should really say," the Marquess smilingly answered,
turning to Mdlle. de Moulin, "that you are the person
he is most tolerant of."&mdash;"Yet, dear Marquess,"
she said, "pray see how far my conquest of him,
which you often rally me about, has proceeded. I
showed him, and at his own desire, a copy of verses,
and he said it was hard to read, as I grant he had a
right to say, but he let me down mightily by
adding, 'however, the words have another defect;
when you have decyphered them they are not worth
reading.' "&mdash;"Well, Mademoiselle, don't be offended;
this is nothing to what he said, when some
one having met 'old Leblanc, with the Abb&eacute; in a
carriage,' said 'they were a fine pair,' not observing
Madame Leblanc was in the room, behind that perfidious

<!-- vol 3 page 152 -->

screen of books, and she good humouredly
enough answered, 'oh, there are plainer women than
old Leblanc, I promise you!'&mdash;'I deny it,' said M.
Liel; and then she went on to observe, 'Well, well,
that's your humour to say so; I repeat my assertion,
and also that there are worse men than the Abb&eacute;.'
'There may,' said he, 'but I don't know them.'
I assure you," the Marchioness added, "his humour
goes consistently through all his life. Don't you
recollect, my dear (<i>mon bon ami</i>), your experiment
on his impossibility of his praising any thing?"&mdash;"Oh!
yes; it was rather entertaining. He is particularly
fond of a roast turkey, and never of course
allows himself such an indulgence, though a great
gourmand. I took extreme pains to have the very
best the whole country could afford, and it was
roasted most carefully, and delicately stuffed with
truffles. He manifestly approved it; for he ate
somewhere about half the bird, and said not a
word; whereupon I was resolved to hear what objection
he had to make, and asked him carelessly
what he thought of it.&mdash;'I have seen worse,' was
the full extent of his commendation. He never has
a servant, a man at least, thinking there is a slight
difference in favour of the sex, and sure that if he

<!-- vol 3 page 153 -->

had a valet their mutual hatred would amount to
fury, as it probably might."&mdash;"One of our men,"
the Marchioness said, "attends him when he sleeps
at the Ch&acirc;teau. He gives him, I find from my
maid, two sous on departing, and once or twice when
a new servant unaccustomed to his ways, looked at
this gift as if surprised, M. Liel said,&mdash;'Oh! give
it me again; I made a mistake,' and took one sous
back."&mdash;"Is this pattern of Christian charity for the
honour of the Established Church?" Lord Mornton
asked.&mdash;"Oh no!" the Marchioness said, "we
(<i>nous autres</i>) have the benefit of his alliance; and I
assure you, if his general hatreds are strong, they
boil over towards the priests, and the monks especially.
He actually grins convulsively when he sees
a <i>collet</i>,<sup id="r020"><a href="#n020">20</a></sup> and he can scarcely keep his hands off a
cowl. He often says, were these tribes only to
oppress and frighten the people, he should be the
last person to complain, but their deceiving them
and fattening upon them, and above all their sometimes
flattering, cajoling, and comforting them is
more than he can at all bear."&mdash;"It is needless
to observe," the Marquess added, "that there is
little love lost between the parties. He is considered

<!-- vol 3 page 154 -->

as an emissary of Satan, if not the Devil himself,
by all our priests and friars. The Abb&eacute; crosses
himself when he passes, as if an evil spirit were by,
and has been heard to mutter&mdash;'Avaunt! thou incarnation
of the Evil One.' "</p>

<p>It turned out from the old steward's remark, who
had known him longer than any one, that the most
singular part of M. Liel's case was the undoubted
confidence which he at all times had that there was
nothing singular in his tastes and his sentiments.
"He believes," said the Sieur Gaspar, "that every
one of us agrees entirely with him; and were he convinced
that we had really any love of our fellow-creatures,
he would only pity and not blame us. But
he is actually persuaded that we hypocritically conceal
our real opinions, suppress our common feelings."&mdash;"Well,
that to me," said Emmeline, "is
most unaccountable."&mdash;"Oh, Mademoiselle," said
Gaspar, "if you will try him upon the subject, I'll
assure you he is not without resources. He has a
good deal more than you may suppose to urge in
favour of his doctrine. He dwells upon the crimes
committed by men against their fellow-creatures;
he dilates much upon the faults of oppressive governments;
he goes over the wicked laws that have been

<!-- vol 3 page 155 -->

made in most countries; above all, he is boundless
in his lectures upon the love of war which has prevailed
in every age and country; and he finds it
impossible to explain these things except by supposing
that whatever we may pretend, we are all of
us as great men-haters as himself."</p>

<p>The day that M. Liel left the Ch&acirc;teau happened
to be Saturday, when, as has been said, a larger
party was generally invited from Nismes than
during the rest of the week. Not only Madame Leblanc
and the Abb&eacute; came, but the Third Judge of
the Languedoc court, whom Lord Mornton had not
before seen; but in whom he found almost as much
food for his gay humour, and as curious a field for
his curious observation of men, as in the ancient
hater-general.</p>

<p>M. Velour was a man of great abilities, much
practical knowledge, and long experience in his
profession, but of little good sense or judgment; of
a temper somewhat impatient, and inflated with an
extraordinary conceit of himself, of his own opinion,
and his own power, though far from underrating
others, except when their sentiments came in conflict
with his own. He gave, generally speaking, great
satisfaction as a judge, only that he was rather more

<!-- vol 3 page 156 -->

eager to dispatch his business than to take the pains
required for its accurate performance; and he was
not popular with the Bar, towards whom he showed
little of the courtesy that distinguished the judicial
demeanour of both his colleagues, M. Chapeley and
M. Balaye. He was also apt to take great likings
for some practitioners, and to restore the balance by
conceiving as strong dislike against others. But the
peculiar characteristic of M. Velour was his little
personal vanity, which made a very able and strictly
honourable man really somewhat ridiculous. He
affected the manners and habits of the Court, not the
court of law at Nismes, but of the Governor's at
Toulouse, and the King's at Versailles. He would
be known among the <i>muscadins</i> for his elegant
manners: he would ride a horse of great beauty
and high action, though trained so as to be quite
safe for a man of his very nervous nature&mdash;a bodily
infirmity which he joined to the most dauntless spirit.
He would frequent the assembly and the ball-room,
avoiding however the dance, for which the extreme
rigour of his limbs was little suited; but playing the
fashionable games of the day with the fashionable
women, who smiled in his presence, receiving his
money, and smiled more when he was not by, recounting

<!-- vol 3 page 157 -->

his little absurdities. To make the acquaintance
of a noble or otherwise distinguished
person he would go a good way; but the distinction
must be of a purely secular or civil cast, rank, or
fashion, or office&mdash;for of literary merit he took no
account; his reading was confined to a small portion
of the last newspaper, his learning to the humble, and
more practical parts of his profession. He valued
himself much on his <i>savoir vivre</i>, took great and just
credit for the excellence of his entertainments, and
gloried in receiving at his house, though unmarried,
the greatest ladies of Nismes and its neighbourhood.
To such a person the entr&eacute;e of the Ch&acirc;teau was invaluable,
and the Marquess frequently invited him
from recollecting his intimacy with the family in his
father's time, when he had been their successful advocate,
while at the bar, in a great lawsuit, though
they had once suffered severely by following his
obstinate and over-sanguine opinion. This was his
constant error: he never would hear of a doubt
or a difficulty in any case; and often made his
clients persist to their undoing, when by compromise
they might have been saved; but this compromise
assumed that there was a possibility of the opinion
he had given being overruled by the court, and that

<!-- vol 3 page 158 -->

possibility was a thing which he never in his whole
life could bring himself even to contemplate, and
which no amount of experience could ever drive into
his mind.</p>

<p>The Marquess had prepared Lord Mornton for
meeting this somewhat singular person, by giving
some such account as the foregoing, adding, however,
that Madame de Bagnolles did not share at all
in his esteem for the judge, because, among other less
blameable fopperies, he chose to think the irreligious
fashion of the day a becoming finery, and looked
down upon churchmen and sectaries with sovereign
contempt, as persons of low understanding as well
as plebeian habits. The Marquess added that, even
after hearing his description, M. Velour would probably
still surprise, if he did not amuse him, with
his little peculiarities, of which it was not easy by
any description to give a true picture.</p>

<p>It happened as the Marquess had said. The Earl
found him a very strange compound of acuteness
and folly; of the most silvery or silky speech, with
occasional heat and obstinacy; of general ignorance
with professional readiness; of entire self-sufficiency
with overdone courtesy to others; of small personal
fopperies, wrought upon a ground of high official

<!-- vol 3 page 159 -->

station; in a word, a strange kind of mule or hybrid,
between a pleader and a petit-maitre, with what would
have seemed also a cross of the actual mule itself,
could that persevering animal have been permitted to
continue its kind.</p>

<p>The first thing that struck Lord Mornton in this
new acquaintance was his precise air, each thread of
his dress and coiffure, as each particle of his person,
being adjusted with the most rigid attention to strict
form, and arranged in the most accurate order.
Then his face was clothed in smiles, and his gait
was precision itself as if he moved to regular time
like a puppet to music. His language next claimed
attention; it no way derogated from the precision
of his formal gait, and its tone was of silver or
of silk, so much so that the Earl could at once
comprehend the Chevalier Deverell's jocose remark,
that if he had been called <i>Soie</i><sup id="r021"><a href="#n021">21</a></sup> instead of
<i>Velour</i>,<sup id="r022"><a href="#n022">22</a></sup> the name would have better indicated the
thing, as he somewhat disrespectfully termed him.
Ernest, however, who had one day been set down by
the bursting loose of a sudden decision, said, "Sir,
you forget the <i>patte</i> which he has."<sup id="r023"><a href="#n023">23</a></sup> The Earl

<!-- vol 3 page 160 -->

soon observed that he was more liberal in giving
out his decisions than lavish of his reasons; it seemed
his rule never to give up a point or give out an
argument. All you could drive him to by pressing
him with reasons was the louder and more authoritative
iteration of his disputed position, prefaced with
a firm "no! no!" slowly uttered and calmly, being
his only answer to your argumentation; and when he
had for the second or peradventure for a third time
dealt forth his dictum, he rested quite satisfied, and
was clothed in a placid smile that indicated a pleasing
confidence in having defeated all his antagonists and
driven them from the field.</p>

<p>The conversation before dinner began with Ernest
giving some account of a bull-fight which he had been
to see in the Roman amphitheatre of Nismes, a
singular and interesting sight, which recalls forcibly
the ancient days of the place, and the practices of the
ancient and barbarous Roman people, who delighted
to meet in thousands and see their fellow-creatures
destroyed by wild beasts or by one another, and even
to condemn their gladiators to death by their signals
as a part of the day's sport. A softer theme and a

<!-- vol 3 page 161 -->

more modern pleased M. Velour; he drew the conversation
to Madame Pignerol's fine assembly of the
evening before, which Madame Leblanc lavishly
commended for the supper, the very best and most
profuse she ever remembered to have seen. "I care
less for that," said M. Velour, "though I grant it
was elegant and choice; but the company was perfect.
I do not imagine I ever saw a finer assemblage,
more people of the first rank and title."&mdash;"Why,
yes," said the woman of all-comprehensive
charity, "and even the Bishop among them; though,
considering what women were there, one did wonder
he should come."&mdash;"As how, Madam?" said the
Abb&eacute;, "as how? Why should not the right reverend
the Bishop of this diocese have access to the very first
persons within its bounds?"&mdash;"Oh, father," said the
charitable, "I meant not in respect of rank, but of
reputation, which was so very deficient that I thought
his lordship had no great business there. I positively
looked about me among all I could see, and could
hardly descry a rag of character to cover those
present. There was Madame"&mdash;"I pray you,"
said M. Velour, "spare us any catalogue&mdash;I for one
have no kind of wish to hear the enumeration. The
women whom I saw were all of the first fashion and

<!-- vol 3 page 162 -->

figure. The assembly was most brilliant."&mdash;"Not
the less," spake the reverend father, "not the less
is Madame Leblanc well warranted in bearing her
testimony, should she be so minded, against the
wickedness of a degenerate age, and so earning the
praise of the saints. Yet, sister, suffer me to say,
the right reverend prelate might be well advised in
going there, seeing he might in truth have the view
of sowing the good seed, and turning many unto
righteousness, there being by your account not a few
there who had need of being plucked from the fire."&mdash;"Doubtless,
sir," said M. Velour, with an ineffable
contempt on his features, which made him wholly
disdain to use any such word as <i>father</i>, "doubtless,
sir, the Bishop must have had some of the views you
mention in honouring us with his presence; for I
played two rubbers of whist with his Excellency, and
each had as partner one of the ladies most talked of
by that charitable portion of the community to which
belongs Madame Leblanc." There was a difficulty
in replying to this, which drove the Abb&eacute; from the
subject, and also from the part of the room occupied
by the Judge. Nor did much more general conversation
take place before dinner; which in so large
a party could give rise to but little talk.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 163 -->

<p>Ernest was somewhat amused with hearing the
Judge refer to his horsemanship, and recording the
qualities of his animal as "a highly impetuous
horse." "Does he," said the Parisian, "get well
over the ground? for I should have doubted it from
what I saw on Thursday afternoon."&mdash;"Oh!" said
the equestrian, with a smile of unspeakable contempt
for his questioner, and satisfaction with himself and
his beast, " you are quite wrong to doubt it. He is
a horse of the finest and the highest action."&mdash;"Possibly,"
said the wicked wag, "possibly, and
useful of pace, unless one were minded to travel
over the ground for any particular purpose."&mdash;"Oh!
I don't understand what you mean. I repeat
that his action is high."&mdash;"And I don't deny
it. I only observed t'other day that though he lifted
high his feet, they seemed to fall nearly on the
ground they had before stood upon. He seemed
like an old troop horse trained to mark time, and
only seemed to march while he advanced not."&mdash;"Like
rider, like horse," whispered the Chevalier
to Lord Mornton; "you'll find that is exactly
the Judge's own way of covering the ground in any
discussion."</p>

<p>But little respectful as he was to others, and only

<!-- vol 3 page 164 -->

tolerant of the Parisian because of his fashionable
habits and reputation, towards the poor Abb&eacute;, a
man of no fashion and also of a religious profession,
he showed no forbearance at all. With
others, it is true, he reasoned not, explained not,
only descanted and decided oracularly. Towards
the Abb&eacute; he barely took the trouble of pronouncing
more than a shrill or an authoritative
"yes," unless once, when he wanted to put him
down, to drive him out of the conversation, better
shared, he deemed, by persons of distinction. The
father had thought it right to say how much
pleased he was with a late decision of the court in
the Church's favour, which, he added, "was only
justice, and must needs be right."&mdash;"Why, sir,
you'll allow me to doubt if gentlemen of your cloth
are very well qualified to say whether a decree is
right or not."&mdash;"Truly," said the champion of the
Church, "I perceive me not the reason wherefore
we should be excluded from having an opinion
touching matters of grave interest to our Holy
Establishment, which God and all the Saints long
preserve!"&mdash;"Sir, I meant not to enter into an argument
with you or any such person; only, I repeat
that I can see no reason to think you can have any

<!-- vol 3 page 165 -->

understanding of the case you allude to, and you,
perhaps, might do well to confine yourself to the
communion of the Saints you speak of."&mdash;A look
of horror was here darted from the venerable man
to the charitable woman across the table; but she
was then wrestling with the leg of a pheasant, whereupon
he, having first devoutly said something inwardly,
as the motion of his mouth and his upturned
eyes testified, suddenly sought consolation in a fragment
of Pat&eacute; de Toulouse, on which his eyes dropped
down, and of which his mouth became possessed one
second of time thereafter.</p>

<p>In the evening, it was observed that M. Velour
seemed restless and uneasy until his favourite occupation
of cards could be commenced. He forgot
that in the Huguenot Ch&acirc;teau such indulgences were
forbidden; and was heard to mutter certain not
very pious ejaculations, which fortunately reached
not the Marquess's ears. Nor did he hear another
reflection which was drawn from him by some one
saying he had met M. de Pignerol going to mass.
"To mass!" he muttered, "I thought they had
given over that superstition." When the Chevalier,
who, as a good Protestant, bore a due aversion towards
the Romish ritual, rather joined in this, saying

<!-- vol 3 page 166 -->

"he feared he should not, but he hoped to see the
day when there would be an end of it, and the
reformed ceremonies alone be used." "Oh, for that
matter," said the most impartial Judge, "I do
assure you, I have an equal respect for both."</p>

<p>Lord Mornton was desirous of having his opinion
upon the present aspect of public affairs, and led the
conversation towards the subject which then occupied
all men, the approaching assembly of the States
General. But the worthy Judge gave him little
encouragement. "I expect," said the Earl, "that a
strong effort will be made by the Court, and backed
by the privileged orders, to keep their sittings apart,
in three, or at least in two separate chambers. On
this the safety of the monarchy depends."&mdash;"I
regard it as wholly immaterial how they sit," said
the Judge. "The weight of property and rank must
carry all before it."&mdash;"But, sir," the Earl replied,
"how can we be sure of that, when there are to be
so many more of the Third Estate than of either the
Clergy or the Noblesse, so that a few of these joining
the Commons must carry the day?"&mdash;"No!" said
M. Velour, "I hold that rank and property must
carry it."&mdash;"But the question is of numbers, not of
weight," rejoined the Earl.&mdash;"No!" reiterated the

<!-- vol 3 page 167 -->

inflexible Judge, "I hold that it depends, and must
depend, on rank and property."&mdash;"Do you mean,"
replied his lordship, "that the influence of the
privileged sitting among the unprivileged class of
deputies will gain over their numbers?"&mdash;"I enter
not into details; but I hold," said the immoveable,
"that rank and property will prevail, as they always
must."&mdash;"In the long run, if you will," the Earl
observed; "but unhappily the mischief will be done
before that period can arrive, and then the influence
of rank and property will come too late to save us."&mdash;"No!"
decided the oracular individual, "they
will save always, and inevitably must save. This
I hold as quite clear."</p>

<p>Here the case seemed truly desperate to Lord
Mornton, and he was fain to be silent with an adversary
as peremptory as he was unreasoning. <i>He</i>,
on the other hand, seemed radiant with glory,
looked as if conscious of supreme power, and bore
himself as if he were understood by all present to
have completely silenced, as in truth he had done,
the English statesman. When he walked, or rather
strutted away, triumphant, to another part of the
salon, the Chevalier, who held him in almost as
much contempt as the Judge shewed to all other

<!-- vol 3 page 168 -->

men, observed to the Marquess, that it was well for
some folks there was no Court of Appeal in society.
"Why," asked the Earl, "is he always as peremptory
and always as sparing of his reasons and as
liberal in his decisions?"&mdash;"Yes," the Marquess said,
"it is the same on the Bench; and though his
extraordinary industry and his power of giving undivided
attention to all that comes before him, with
his long practical experience in our courts, prevent
him from often falling into errors, yet the Appeal
Court is frequently applied to; much more frequently
than successfully by those against whom
he decides. For it is one evil consequence of his
method, his dogmatism without argument, that often
when he has decided rightly, parties are dissatisfied,
and appeal with little or no chance of being the
gainers; whereas the other judges, M. Chapeley and
M. Balaye, carefully explaining their views, and
assigning the grounds of their judgments, prevent
many an appeal from dissatisfied suitors which the
unreasoning, unbending Velour gives rise to when he
has decided drily and sententiously the self-same
questions."</p>

<p>The Marquess mentioned as a curious instance of
M. Velour's vanity, and attention to the concerns

<!-- vol 3 page 169 -->

of fashionable life, that when he was raised to the
bench, and considered it incumbent on him to keep a
certain state and style, and gratify his sovereign desire
of shining in polished circles, he made very minute and
anxious inquiries into the details of the housekeeping
(<i>m&eacute;nage</i>) at Bagnolles. He consulted the Sieur
Gaspar confidentially as to the pecuniary expense
of certain things; the old steward had sense enough
of the ridiculous to relish this, and handed him over
for other information to the upper servants and the
housekeeper. These he elaborately interrogated in
all the details of their several departments. "And
what has been the result of all these preliminary
proceedings?" asked the Earl.&mdash;"Oh, on the whole
successful," was the reply. "His house is extremely
well got up (<i>mont&eacute;e</i>), and his entertainments are
good, always making allowance for their somewhat
overdone appearance, and for the numberless coxcombries
which the wags of the bar never fail to
note, while they consume his cheer, and the ladies
of 'rank and property' never silently see while
they win his money."</p>

<p>Lord Mornton was glad to have had an opportunity
of seeing one whom he considered almost as
great an original as M. Liel, though very far from

<!-- vol 3 page 170 -->

being as entertaining; and the Judge left the Ch&acirc;teau,
satisfied that he had made a deep impression upon
the English noble as a man of profound wisdom,
but somewhat careless whether he had or not, while
he was quite sure that as a man of fashion his success
had been absolutely complete.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">A KNIGHT&mdash;A FRIAR.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A letter</span> arrived from Nismes for the Marchioness,
brought, as the servant said, by a man
in an odd kind of garb, a servant by his employment,
but rather like a Reformed clergyman by his
dress and manners, and also speaking in a strange,
precise, pedantic sort of style, and with a twang in
his pronunciation. Being told that it was impossible
his letter should be delivered to Madame de
Bagnolles, as she was sick in bed, he said,&mdash;"I do
pray you, good friend, be pleased to give it the
master of this house, for my orders were that it be
rendered to some one of the family." The servant
begged his master would see the man, whom he
could not well comprehend, so the Marquess went
out. When asked from whom the letter came, he
said, "From my master, who is more of a friend
to me, and also an instructor." But this giving

<!-- vol 3 page 172 -->

scanty information, he was asked to name him.
"His name, my friend," he replied, "is one of which
any might be proud, if pride were lawful in limited
creatures; he is the Chevalier Andr&eacute; Agneau." The
Marquess, therefore, conjectured on what the letter
must be, as this Chevalier was well known to be a
man of a single idea, the observance of the Sunday,
or as he termed it not very correctly, the Sabbath.
Having been travelling in the South he had come to
Nismes, attracted, he said, by its high reputation as
a "godly city," by which he meant one in which the
Reformed faith abounded.</p>

<p>The letter, being read by M. de Bagnolles to
the company, was calculated to excite the merriment
of some, but the indignation or scorn of others;
for its excessive cant was mixed up with an infinite
degree of spiritual pride. It was pharisaical
and dictatorial throughout, proceeding upon the
assumption that its writer was infallible, and that
his mission was to school all other mortals, as mere
erring and even sinful creatures. He said how
much he felt gratified at being in so "God-fearing
a town as Nismes, and communing with a truly
Sabbath-keeping people;" that he had also heard
much in favour of the Marchioness herself, and

<!-- vol 3 page 173 -->

hoped to have more ground for commending her, as
it was his wish to be able to do, provided he might
with a safe conscience; but, he said, "he felt it his
bounden duty, which he must no wise be slack in
performing, to warn her against the heinous sin of
Sabbath-breaking, which she allowed to be committed
by harbouring certain persons at her residence,
who were seen to walk, and even to ride, nay
actually to drive out in carriages on the Lord's
Day."&mdash;This abomination, he said, he felt imperatively
called upon to remonstrate against, and to
bear his testimony for the truth, reminding the
Marchioness, that Nismes was a Sabbath-observing
country in the true Scriptural sense of the word; and
beseeching her to reflect on the effects of the example
set by her&mdash;of what he called "the overwhelming
moral influence of the example of the
Ch&acirc;teau." He called the Sabbath a sign, by Divine
appointment, of the righteousness which exalteth a
nation, and besought her above every thing to "travail
with the ungodly who abode under her roof, the
stranger within her gate, to the end that each one
might hallow the holy day of the Lord." He
referred her to the great covenant of water which
had been administered at her baptism, whereby

<!-- vol 3 page 174 -->

she partook of the promises, and bound herself,
or was bound by proxy, to keep the Sabbath holy,
and he concluded with a prayer "that it may
be made a sign between God and the Marchioness,
whereby she may know that He is the Lord her
God."</p>

<p>Some discussion here arose on the answer which
it would be fit to give this extraordinary letter, the
more extraordinary and the less called for, as the
Marquess observed, because really the Sabbath was
most strictly observed in their Huguenot household.
And, accordingly, the silly knight had been driven
to carp at the harmless act of Sunday rides and
drives. The company was divided in opinion what
course to take. The Chevalier at once declared for
"administering the covenant of water" to his brother
knight, "to the which solemnity," he said, "the horse-pond
nigh to the stable afforded a providential
convenience." Lord Mornton was much disposed to
write an answer, which he offered to undertake. But
both these courses were rejected by the Marquess
as certain to offend Madame de Bagnolles, whose
leaning was very likely to be even favourable to
Sir Andr&eacute;, and who at all events would never
tolerate any breach of courtesy or even respect to

<!-- vol 3 page 175 -->

a man whom she regarded as entirely well-meaning,
 however she might possibly (and even this
was not certain) consider him as mistaken. Therefore
the consultation ended in their all agreeing to
the suggestion of Lord Mornton, whose curiosity
got the better of his love of sport, and who wished
to see this Champion of the Sabbath. The Marquess
accordingly invited him to the Ch&acirc;teau; and
at the same time, having a presentiment of the dullness
that awaited the party, he invited an Irish
Friar who was passing through and had some knowledge
of Lord Mornton; indeed came from the same
part of the country. The Earl, however, aware of
the nature of his countryman, warned the worthy
host only to ask him for that day's dinner, else he
might find it less difficult to dislodge the rooks from
the trees than the Friar from comfortable quarters.
While the party at the Ch&acirc;teau were sitting before
dinner in the library, the invited guests were announced.
And first there entered the knight, to
whose name all present forthwith proceeded to make
the addition "<i>of the woeful countenance</i>." The Chevalier
Agneau was indeed well entitled to this honour.
Of a tall figure, whose straightness much reminded
the mathematician how he defined a right line, for

<!-- vol 3 page 176 -->

it was length without breadth; of a stiffness so
perfect that part of his toilette seemed to be swallowing
a poker; of a pale and worn hue, a gaunt aspect,
deeply sunken eyes, locks which rivalled his figure
in observing the rectilinear course&mdash;all at once confessed
that, did his moral rectitude keep parallel
with his physical, and were his integrity as inflexible
as his spine, he might be well entitled to enthrone
himself on those heights from which he
delighted, as his letter showed, to look down upon
others, and to thank God he was not as they are.
His gait and his manner in general were much such
as his figure would probably lead to&mdash;the functions
were like what the structure entitled the beholder to
expect; or rather the movements to be looked for
were limited to what such a mechanism was calculated
to perform. The bow wherewithal he saluted
the company had its origin at the lowest of the
vertebrae, the centre from which the long body described
a circular arc; his face exhibited no change
whatever when he either performed this evolution,
as he did slowly and deliberately, or when he, with
a voice neither harsh nor unkind, hoped the Marchioness
was mending in health, in token of the
prayers of the congregation two days ago having

<!-- vol 3 page 177 -->

been favourably heard. He sate him down near the
Chevalier, who seemed somewhat discomposed, and
gave the kind of look which one does upon the near
approach of some unwelcome being that either walks
on four legs or moves along without any legs at all.
Accordingly he moved off, and met the Friar Patrick,
who followed immediately after the dismal Knight,
and presented a remarkable contrast to what
M. Deverell regarded as the disgrace of chivalry.
For he was a fair, sleek, comfortable-looking personage,
with a ruddy face and complacent smile,
sharp and somewhat cunning eyes, a stubble of
beard, whereupon snuff remained like manure on
the field, a great breadth and depth of chest, and a
paunch to which the Chevalier could urge no objection,
if it were not that of jealousy. He hardly
had saluted the Marquess, when he ran up to Lord
Mornton, and said how pleased he was to meet here
"the very first and foremost man in all Ireland, and
who would soon be at the top of them all in England
too." The language in which this was conveyed
saved the high-bred Earl from the annoyance
which he must have felt had it been understood by
any but the Doverells, who were also aware of the
Irish peculiarities, and that such phrases in their

<!-- vol 3 page 178 -->

mouths mean exactly nothing more than "how do
you do," or "very well, I thank you."</p>

<p>The announcement of dinner gave Friar Patrick
occasion to observe that it was news which seldom
came amiss to him, after he had been walking about
in the discharge of his duty to visit all the sick and
dying in the town. The Chevalier Andr&eacute; vehemently
denied that this could be true, or even near the
truth, because there were more persons in Nismes
who would be horror-struck at seeing the Friar's
habit before them than at the approach of death
itself. "Och! and so much the worse for them,"
said the father, no way put out at his summary conviction
of invention on the spot. "Och! so much
the worse for them! And indeed they may happen
soon to be a-seeing some one they will like worse
still."&mdash;"I tell you, sir," said M. Agneau, "and I tell
you very plainly, that there may be no mistake,
these good souls would not like worse to see the very
death you allude to, grim though it be."&mdash;"Ough,"
said Patrick, "and it was not death at all, at all; I
was talking of some one else that comes after him,
and will may be pay off my scores with your people,
who you say choose to depart in sin for fear
of seeing a holy friar." M. Agneau was beginning

<!-- vol 3 page 179 -->

to express, but in a precise, and formal, and lugubrious
fashion his horror at hearing a clergyman
speak so lightly of so awful an individual, when the
Marquess handed Madame de Chatillon into the
dining-room, and the Father soon found it wholly
impossible to divide his attention, or abstract it from
temporal to spiritual matters. He only muttered
that there was a time for all things, according to
the wise man, whose text he thought fit to expound
by adding, "And why not a dinner-time as well?"
His boisterous talk was accordingly little or not
at all heard for the next hour or so. The Chevalier
Deverell had been somewhat alarmed at the dilemma
in which he found himself, of having to shun
the near neighbourhood of the thing he most
hated, a monk, and, what he now thought nearly
as bad, the Agneau, whom he termed a lay-brother
equal to any one of the regular gang. He with
some difficulty effected his escape by seating himself
next his son and the Sieur Gaspar, upon whose
sympathy he could securely reckon in all that regarded
either of his particular aversions. They indeed
enjoyed a little snug conversation together,
the expense of which was borne by the Knight and
the Friar in nearly equal shares. Thus when the

<!-- vol 3 page 180 -->

Knight, after touching on the many "professing
folks" who dwelt in Nismes, commending the Protestants
lavishly for their "diligent attendance upon
ordinances," hinting at the serious "backslidings"
of the Established Church, and yet giving the town
generally a hearty blessing in the form of a prayer
or devout ejaculation on it, as "a God-fearing quarter,"&mdash;when
after this he took occasion to enter his
protest, or, as he phrased it, take up his testimony,
against what he termed "the unknown tongues,"
and commended the Apostle Paul as having denounced
praying in Latin, when he said who ever
did so speak spoke not to men, the Friar for one
instant suspended his operations to observe that the
same text also said "he spoke unto God," which, the
Baron drily observed, seemed something when you
were praying. M. Deverell whispered to the
steward, that he did not believe any tongue was
much more unknown than that of the sorrowful
Knight himself, with his ordinances, his professions,
his backslidings, his testimonies. The Sieur Gaspar,
however, assured him that all of the same caste (or
as he jocosely termed it, of the same cant) had a
glimglibber of their own, and quite understood one
another, like freemasons, "I suppose," said the

<!-- vol 3 page 181 -->

Chevalier, "each understanding his brother's mummery
about as clearly as his brother understands it
himself."</p>

<p>The dinner must be admitted not to have been
enlivened by the addition of the worthy Knight
and reverend Father; it was not the gayest that
had been known at the Ch&acirc;teau. The Countess,
the only lady present, would not condescend to
treat with any courtesy a personage whose whole
time seemed to be occupied with mere trifles; for,
though by no means deficient in religious feelings,
and even leaning strongly towards the Reformed
faith from her Swiss education, she yet regarded
all questions of a ceremonial nature with utter
contempt; and when she had attended mass, or the
temple, which she did indiscriminately, she considered
the rest of the Sunday her own, regarding
with inexpressible contempt the strict observance of
it which her kinswoman maintained at the Ch&acirc;teau,
and always forming a circle of less rigid "Sabbath-keepers,"
in her own apartment during the evening,
while the rest of the family were engaged in
psalmody and prayer.</p>

<p>When the party met in the salon Emmeline
joined them, and was curious to see a person she had

<!-- vol 3 page 182 -->

heard in the morning described by the Baron as a
dismal original; for this union of dulness with originality
she could not well comprehend. However,
she was doomed to find the difficulty overcome by
the infinite variety of nature; for he was a thing at
once grotesque and dull, quite singular, and quite
unentertaining. This Knight of the Sabbath, it appeared,
had so worked up his mind to an exclusive
interest in his one subject, that the fourth commandment
to him was more important than all the other
nine, in the habitual breach of one, at least, of which
he really seemed to live; for let him but see any person
do an act not of absolute necessity on that day,
and he at once bore witness against him as if he had
committed the most serious of offences. But he could
tolerate much from any one who filled up the seventh
day with prayer, and looked gloomy and dismal, and
ate nothing that required cooking, took no exercise,
and barely existed. He had, however, one admirable
quality for an enthusiast. He was not only perfectly
sincere, but he was extremely patient of contradiction.
He received with perfect calmness whatever
was urged in opposition to his doctrines; his features
even relaxed into a kind of something between a
grin and a smile, which was meant for the latter;

<!-- vol 3 page 183 -->

and an air of perfect peace and quiet, something as
near complacency as his visage could approach,
seemed spread over it, when he either listened or
replied to any objections urged against his tenets.
The cause of this was very obvious. He had the
most undoubting confidence in his nostrum; nothing
could shake this full assurance of its absolute
efficacy; it was a cure for all ills here, as well as a
preservative from all evils hereafter. Hence he
regarded the buffeting he occasionally was exposed
to, much as a person does a storm at sea when
he is looking at it from a window on shore; he
eyed the combatants who roared or laughed at
him, as he would so many tigers or hyaenas
raging or grinning through the solid bars of their
cages.</p>

<p>The Marquess avoided all discussion with him,
because he dreaded in his excellent wife's absence
saying a word which might betoken any doubt or
any light feeling in what she regarded almost as
devoutly as the Knight, though somewhat more
rationally. But the Baron could by no means suffer
the evening to pass without a tilt; and he was
willingly seconded by the Earl, as soon as he could
disengage himself from Father Patrick's oily talk.

<!-- vol 3 page 184 -->

The company heard little of this t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te, but the
closing part would have amused them had it not
been veiled in an "unknown tongue," from most of
them.&mdash;"You have been as far as Italy, then, of
late?" said Lord Mornton.&mdash;"That I have, sure,"
said the Friar. Lord Mornton said he was going
there for the winter, probably to Rome.&mdash;"Och! and
do that same, my lord; you will see his Holiness."&mdash;"Did
you, when at Rome, Father?"&mdash;"And to
be sure I did, and a mighty pleasant old gentleman
he is, and has a very great respect for your Lordship."&mdash;"For
me, Father?" said the Earl, with
much astonishment.&mdash;"Aye, indeed, and for who but
you?"&mdash;"Why, how can he possibly be aware of
my existence? "&mdash;"Och! dear, and sure we all of
us know your lordship, and are proud of you; and
when I told his Holiness you were a-coming to
Rome, he seemed mightily well pleased, I'll assure
you." This was a little too gross for even one
inured to the style of his countrymen, so the Earl
willingly retreated upon the harder and more bearable
Knight, with whom the Baron was beginning
his conversation.</p>

<p>"Really, Chevalier," said M. de Moulin, "I cannot
help thinking you are a little severe upon our

<!-- vol 3 page 185 -->

good neighbours of Nismes, as to their Sabbath
failings."</p>

<p>"Sir," replied the Knight, "those of whom I
now spake were not the godly of Nismes, but the
Romish portion of that people, whom I give myself
no pain about, as not taking any heed of brands
actually in the burning; though even, as touching
the Reformed, so contagious is evil example and
impure communication, I here last Lord's-day,
attended the Temple, and on my going thither saw
a Reformed family driving themselves out in a
carriage yoked with mules, contrary to the very express
letter of the law, which says 'thy ass.' Then,
how could they after that expect a blessing of rain,
for which they put up prayers?"</p>

<p>"Och! and as for that," said the Friar, glad to
take the heretic at a disadvantage, as he thought,
"Don't let them go to trouble themselves, and
bother themselves and the blessed Saints with their
prayers for rain. No rain will they have."</p>

<p>"I really cannot see," said the Marquess, "why
the Reformed congregation's prayers are to be less
efficacious than other people's."</p>

<p>"My dear," said the Friar, "I mean that
none of them all will ever have a drop of rain

<!-- vol 3 page 186 -->

while the wind keeps in the north; and so will they
not."</p>

<p>"Why, truly, Father," the Earl observed, "that
is an odd view of the subject. Then do you believe
the offering of prayer depends on the wind?"</p>

<p>The crafty Irishman saw his grievous error, and
got suddenly out of it. "Easy there, my Lord,
easy. What I mean is, that it wants a good Saint
to do the trick when the mistral keeps a-blowing,
and never a bit of a Saint have these heretics to
help them."</p>

<p>The Baron wished to continue his discussion with
him of the sorrowful countenance, which this bye-battle
had interrupted, so he came back to the
charge he had begun when the meteorological
divinity of Friar Patrick had broken in upon them.
"I conceive. Chevalier," said he, "that this doctrine
of strict Sabbath observance is not quite borne out
by the authority of Scripture."</p>

<p>"As how?" said the Knight mildly, and even triumphantly&mdash;"Do
you speak of the Old Covenant
or of the New?"</p>

<p>"Of the New, certainly," answered the Baron.
"It is said the Sabbath was made for man, and not
man for the Sabbath."</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 187 -->

<p>"Aye," replied the Knight, "it is so said, and the
passage contains a deep and a mysterious meaning,
the very reverse of what you seem to give it."</p>

<p>"However," the Baron said, "I leave all controverted
passages on one side. No mystery can lurk
under the plain appeal to the Pharisees, your predecessors,
in this rigour of Sabbath-keeping&mdash;that
all of them would save his sheep or his asses on the
Sabbath, if they fell into a pit."</p>

<p>"No mystery? Indeed!" asked Sir Andr&eacute;.
"Why, can we tell with any certainty what is
meant here by sheep? As for asses, you have
added them."</p>

<p>The Chevalier Deverell here whispered to Gaspar
that it was a very natural mistake when one was
conversing with the silly Knight, to think of asses.
"Truly his name connects itself easily with sheep,
but he never will attain the rank and station of a
mad one (<i>mouton enrag&eacute;</i>). A duller animal did I
never yet come across."</p>

<p>"Allow me," said the Baron, "to give you my
opinion at once on your Sabbath theory. I entirely
approve of a due and even a strict observance of that
day, that it may ever be one of rest, and no labour
allowed on it. But to exclude all innocent recreation,

<!-- vol 3 page 188 -->

I hold really both contrary to the nature of
rest, and impolitic for the purpose you have in view
of enforcing a due observance of the day. For
by compelling men to be absolutely still and idle,
and avoid all recreation, you make it a day of
penance, not of repose; and by taking this course
you render Sabbath-keeping unpopular. Recollect,
I beseech you, that our humbler fellow-citizens have
no other day wherein to amuse themselves. You
have the whole six, and can easily submit to pass
the seventh in dullness, which after all you perhaps
don't dislike. They have no other day of relaxation,
and they are exceedingly averse to such dismal
observances as you may delight in."</p>

<p>The Knight continued as placid and as grim as
before; but instead of meeting the Baron's powerful
and practical reasoning, he drew himself up, and
involved himself in a cloud of vague generalities,
clothed in language of a mysterious and spiritual
kind, wherein were chiefly heard the words duty
God-ward, professing Christians, godly and God-fearing,
strong testimony, covenant, signs, sanctification.
The discussion was thus darkened as by the
coming on of night; and disputants all were wrapped in
the sable gloom, and like the animals, the cattle and

<!-- vol 3 page 189 -->

painted birds, stretched their weary limbs, smoothed
their cares, and soothed their hearts oblivious of the
labours of the day. The dismal personage rose
slowly to depart; his woeful countenance no longer
shed a gloom over the library; his temporary comrade,
the Friar, followed to share his heretical but
convenient vehicle; and they quitted the hospitable
Ch&acirc;teau, leaving their characters a legacy to the
Chevalier, the Baron, and the Countess, who proceeded
forthwith to "do what they pleased with their
own." Only Emmeline made any defence for the
departed Knight. His perfect honesty and singleness
of heart, his enthusiasm, however extravagant and
unreflecting, yet perfectly sincere, and connecting
itself with sacred subjects, his entire freedom from
all gall, and his even gentle demeanour, in her eyes
redeemed his unquestionable dulness; and she was
ever ready to take a very small portion of the wisdom
that is from above, in compensation of any lack
of that in which the children of this world so far
excel the children of light. For the Friar she had
nothing at all to say. She was disgusted with his
vulgar forwardness, and nauseated his low, indiscriminate
flattery. But above all his plain carelessness
about truth was offensive to her, and was not at all

<!-- vol 3 page 190 -->

redeemed by the constitutional good-humour, the
gaiety of the body, as much as of the mind, which
he possessed, or which possessed him, allied as it
was on the one hand to some wit and drollery, on
the other to no little sensual indulgence.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="small">LEAVING THE CH&Acirc;TEAU.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> illness of the Marchioness had gradually become
manageable under the skilful advice of an
eminent practitioner from Montpellier, who came
several times to Bagnolles, and appeared to stand
less in awe of remedies and have more dread of
diseases than his learned brother of Nismes had
shown in young M. Deverell's case. Madame de
Bagnolles was at length restored to the society of
her family and guests; she gave the merit of her
recovery entirely to a higher power than the physician,
whom she only regarded as an instrument; and
she marked her restoration to health by not only
returning thanks in the congregation of M. Gardein,
but distributing her charity among the poor
cottagers near the Ch&acirc;teau, who regarded her as a
mother, and among the poor of the worthy pastor's
flock. Not confining her benevolence, however, to

<!-- vol 3 page 192 -->

the members of her own sect, she visited the noble
hospital of Nismes, and left a sum with the kind-hearted
and hard-labouring sisters of charity (<i>s&oelig;urs
de charite</i>) under whose care its several departments
are so admirably administered, that the Montpellier
physician said he knew of no laboratory more accurately
and even learnedly conducted than that of
Sister Agatha and her two helpmates in this establishment.
The vows of these sisters are only for
twelve months, but such are the pleasures of charity
combined with industry and not deprived of rational
liberty, that it is rare to see those vows not renewed
from year to year.</p>

<p>The Marchioness's health having been the cause,
possibly in part the pretext, of the guests prolonging
their visit, symptoms now appeared of the party
which had lasted so long and proved so agreeable at
length breaking up. The Chevalier and his son went
first, to the no small relief of the Countess, who,
however, by her frequent allusions to Ernest, her
curiosity about his habits, and especially her minute
enquiries into his female intimacies and attachments,
evinced a continuation of the extreme uneasiness
which she had already shewn the Baron he had
given her, though in what way he never could discover,

<!-- vol 3 page 193 -->

fearing to ask any questions or take any other
means of inquiry with one so suspicious and so
acute. Her restlessness on this subject was such,
that not only the Baron, who watched each word
and each look of his idol, but her careless husband,
could not help perceiving it. "Why, Catherine,"
he one day said, while they were all conversing in
the portico after breakfast, "what can it signify how
his affair with the German Baroness ended? Is not
it enough that now he is devoted to a French
Countess?"&mdash;"I really, Chatillon," said she, contemptuously
enough, "don't know who you allude
to."&mdash;"I am sorry you don't, my love," he answered.
"But I dare to say he never troubles his head about
the Chevalier de Morne (her first husband). Then
why should you care about the Baroness?"&mdash;"The
Chevalier was a man, Chatillon, whom you would
do well to imitate; such a man as few indeed are
like."&mdash;"Oh, dear, I have the highest respect for
him," said his successor; "I am sure no one has
more reason to lament his loss than myself."&mdash;"Why,
you did not know him,"&mdash;said she sharply, to the
infinite amusement of the company, and especially
Lord Mornton, who saw that with all her quickness
she could be so seriously intent on her subject that

<!-- vol 3 page 194 -->

a joke escaped her. However, with her usual tact,
and her relish of a harmless pleasantry, she took it
in good part, and was restored to good humour.</p>

<p>The conversation then turned upon the morning's
news as usual, and all gave great praise to M. Necker's
first measures, by which he applied the balances
in the different revenue departments to the immediate
service of the treasury, and retracing the Archbishop's
fatal steps, ordered all the claims on it to be liquidated
without delay. "Here," said Lord Mornton,
"in the management and control of the finances, he
is quite at home. Heaven grant that in the more
important and far more arduous parts of his office,
the management, and above all the control, of the
people, he may show equal vigour. My fears point to
his fears, his dread of popular odium&mdash;his fondness
for glory, as no doubt he calls his ruling propensity&mdash;his
vain love of mob-applause, as I term it&mdash;and his
unwillingness to expose himself to the storm in order
to save the ship committed to his care."&mdash;"I would
fain hope," the Baron said, "that he will not be
without powerful allies. I speak not of the Court,
which seems to be utterly devoid of firmness and of
wisdom, to have no resources in itself, and to be the
sport of each wind that blows. But I look, I own,

<!-- vol 3 page 195 -->

to the body of the privileged orders, the noblesse and
the clergy. Surely they will join him in stemming
the popular torrent if it sets in so strongly as you
apprehend, and as, from present indications, I myself
believe it will."</p>

<p>"My dear Baron," said the Earl, "if the French
clergy and the French noblesse resembled our English
church and peerage, I should have no fears at
all. But these are the same names for things entirely
different. You nobles are a body almost like
our commoners, of perhaps a hundred thousand,
who have the privileges and rank, but of whom not
above two hundred families are really of the old
true nobility, respected as such, and as such enjoying
their privileges without any one grudging them.
Why, not much above that number have even the
right of going to Court, by tracing their descent
back to the year 1400, yet all of them insult the
people by their exemptions and their titles, and
are hated accordingly, while they themselves hate
those real patricians who are above them. As
for the clergy, it is nearly the same thing. The
parish priest, the cur&eacute;, works hard and lives hard
upon a small pittance, while the emoluments
of the church are engrossed by the prelates, and

<!-- vol 3 page 196 -->

canons, and abbots, and are the provision of the
noble families. Hence you will find the inferior
clergy much more likely to side with the people,
from whose body they are taken, than with the
Court. In England, I need hardly tell you, all this
is quite the reverse; the nobility, few in number,
are possessed of large wealth, much influence, direct
power both judicial and legislative; the clergy are
of all ranks indiscriminately, and those who work
are paid; thus the throne has a barrier which no
tempest is likely ever to break through."</p>

<p>The Marquess observed that he took the same
gloomy view of the question with Lord Mornton,
and he added that many persons of good judgment
believed the privileged orders would shew more
jealousy of the Crown by a great deal than the commoners,
nay, that the discontented, intriguing, and
turbulent portions of those privileged orders, the
inferior nobility and clergy, were very likely to join
the violent faction of the Tiers Etat, and carry the
more moderate and innocent along with them to
desperate extremities.</p>

<p>A question being started as to the mode in which
the election of the deputies would be carried on,
Lord Mornton professed to think it signified exceedingly

<!-- vol 3 page 197 -->

little in whom the right of voting was
vested on this occasion. Whatever class of the people
chose, they would probably pitch upon the same
persons, the men of forward manners, active habits,
little solid merit, and no modesty&mdash;lawyers like M.
Catteau; perhaps many of those literary men whose
publications the Archbishop had advertised for. The
only important point, in his lordship's view, was
the sitting together or apart. If the whole body
were to be melted into one mass, he regarded the
monarchy of France as doomed to inevitable and to
speedy destruction; and considered the desiring of
the States to meet in one chamber as not a Union of
States, but a Revolution. He added,&mdash;"And if it be
true, as the Baron believes, that M. Necker has determined
to give the Commons a number of representatives
equal to the two other orders combined, then
of course he means that all should unite in one mass
to overthrow the monarchy; and, however little he
may intend it, or desire it, I shall then regard M.
Necker as the author of this Revolution."</p>

<p>"How hard a measure you deal out of responsibility!"
said the Countess; "You almost make a
minister answerable for events."&mdash;"Certainly, I do,"
said the firm-minded Earl, upon whom no petty consideration

<!-- vol 3 page 198 -->

could have any sway in a matter of grave
public concernment; "Certainly I do, whenever I
can fairly connect the event with the minister's conduct.
Nay, it is a safe rule to attach responsibility
to office, and not to be very nice in looking for
the connection between that conduct and the event."&mdash;"Why,
really," she answered "you remind me of
the King of Prussia, who, seeing the soldiers' hats
blow off, as they said owing to the wind, flogged the
first man whose hat went."&mdash;"The wise King of
Prussia!" said the Earl; "And you will please to
remember the result; the wind blew much as before
in that bleak, open, uninhabitable country, but, some
how or other, no more hats blew off. Don't, however,
suppose me harsh towards M. Necker, whom
all esteem and many admire. I should deal out the
same measure of justice to one I love as a brother,
I mean Mr. Pitt."&mdash;"What course do you expect
he would hold in difficulties such as now beset our
government?"&mdash;"Who can say? Hitherto he has
only been tried as a financier and a debater, and in
both capacities he has proved of first-rate power.
I should expect&mdash;we never can be sure of the future,
even in men best known to us&mdash;but I should expect
a firm and unflinching hand would in such perils be

<!-- vol 3 page 199 -->

found to guide us. My position, however, is quite
general. I look to the minister as responsible. He
volunteers to take the helm, and he is bound to bring
both courage and skill to the task."</p>

<p>The approaching separation was a most cruel
blow upon both the Baron and the Countess, who
now passed their whole time together either in walking
or conversing under the portico, or reading in
the library. Though he stood in awe of her imperious
disposition and irritable temper, the only
things of which he had ever known what it was to
stand in awe, yet the charms of her conversation, and
above all his devoted attachment, which she fully
returned, made her society a necessary part of his
existence; nor could he well see how he was to pass
his days, and above all his long evenings, without it.
She, on the other hand, deeply felt the approaching
change; for all the interest she once felt in life
seemed on the point of being destroyed. She could
no longer take an interest in politics without having
him recalled to her recollection, him in whose
society all her political discussions had so long been
carried on, and in concert with whom all her little
plans had been devised. She had, unhappily, no
family to occupy her thoughts; he was become the

<!-- vol 3 page 200 -->

sovereign care of her mind; and losing him, or
separated from him, she seemed to lose all. His
letters, indeed, afforded her the prospect of some
resource, far more than hers offered to him; he
plainly avowed that he should reckon that but a
poor substitute for the delights he had enjoyed in
her presence. His vows to return and meet her
next year, when the Bagnolles expected a re-assembling
of the same delightful party, were what she
mainly relied on. But both he and she were fain
to confess that a comfort delayed for twelve months,
or it might be more, helped little to make those
months pass swiftly away; and neither could be
blind to the lowering aspect of public affairs which
made all plans uncertain that were to be executed
at so considerable a distance of time.</p>

<p>In this state of reluctance to part, day after day
were allowed to pass away, and at length the Count,
who was obliged to be in Paris by a certain time,
fixed the hour of departure at a week's distance.
This week was passed by him in constant conversation
with Albert, whom he in vain besought to let
him make an attempt at bringing away Louise.
Albert saw the difficulty of obtaining her consent
after what had happened last year; he also had

<!-- vol 3 page 201 -->

awakened to what never then sufficiently occupied
him, eager in the pursuit and looking neither to the
right nor to the left, but fixing his eyes only on
the object before him, the extreme difficulty first
of his escaping with her into Switzerland, and
next of his supporting her there in anything like
the ease and comfort she had all her life been
accustomed to enjoy. This consideration, indeed,
tended exceedingly to console him for the cruel
disappointment he had suffered, and softened the
bitterness of a separation made doubly vexatious by
the exquisite delights of the momentary meeting
with her in the Cont&acirc;t. He resisted, therefore, all
Chatillon's generous proposals of chivalrous devotion;
and was resolved to continue in his present
concealment until the changes now apparently inevitable
should restore him to liberty, never doubting
that whatever kind of constitution might arise
out of the present crisis, it must be one which should
relieve both Louise from thraldom and himself
from alarm.</p>

<p>Chatillon had never communicated to the Countess
the particulars of Albert's history, further than
informing her that he was a convert from the
Catholic religion, in which he had at one time

<!-- vol 3 page 202 -->

taken orders, and that he was under persecution for
a supposed offence also against the civil power.
Her growing attachment for the Baron had, indeed,
abated her curiosity on this as on all other subjects;
and she did not trouble him to disclose what he
seemed unwilling to tell. But her interest was not
so lukewarm in the affairs of the Baron; and as he
had often promised to unfold a mystery which he
told her hung over his history, before they parted he
gave her some outline of his life. The narrative
fixed her entire attention; for, independent of the
degree in which she felt interested about all that
concerned him, the vicissitudes he had gone through,
the extraordinary adventures he had engaged in, the
strange scenes he had witnessed, gave the liveliest
dramatic effect to his story, and at the same time
displayed his character in its most striking points.
His fiery temper; his indomitable passions; the
depth and endurance of his revenge; his incapacity
to forget either kindness or injury, though capable
of forgiving the one, and overlooking the other; his
pride bordering upon disease, and ever at war with
his interest; his dark retirement within himself,
unsocial and unapproachable; all were displayed at
each successive stage of his life in colours which it

<!-- vol 3 page 203 -->

required his own eloquence to use with their due
effect. The picture interested her; she, less than any
other, was shocked with its harsher features; she, less
than any other, was repulsed by the parts which were
shaded with guilt; but there was one redeeming tint
thrown over the whole; one hue of aerial perspective
which deadened the effect of the fiercer lights,
and threw a gleam into the more sombre shades, a
hue which was spread over all the canvas; it was
his tender devotion to Emmeline; to her father first,
afterwards to herself. This affection, the engrossing
sentiment of his heart, was second nature, was the
quality which redeemed all his errors, and mitigated
a character otherwise unrelenting and harsh. The
Countess, less disposed than almost any other woman
to be touched with this, and who in any person but
himself might possibly have disregarded it, felt its
enchantment when she found it belonged to him
who had made so deep an impression upon her
heart.</p>

<p>But if there was much to strike, there was not
a little to astonish in the facts which his history
brought to her knowledge. She now found, to her
amazement, that he was not originally a Fleming,
though in Flanders he had long resided, and held distinguished

<!-- vol 3 page 204 -->

places under the government. He came
from the Venaissin, and had lately returned thither
after a long absence, having left it with a brother
when very young, in consequence of some domestic
difference aggravated by his impetuous temper, and
from his daring, adventurous disposition made the
ground of quitting his family. "I tenderly loved
my mother," he said, after going over the chief part
of his story, "but with my father, who was harsh
and severe, I, who had as much pride as himself,
was on less friendly terms. It became impossible
for me now to avow in Flanders that I was French;
all connection with France was, therefore, of necessity
to cease; it seemed better not to do things
by halves; and I, therefore, suffered my family to
suppose us both dead, myself and my brother whose
fortunes I raised with my own. This has been to
me the source of most bitter self-upbraiding. I
sacrificed to worldly ambition, and a silly pride towards
my father, the tenderest affections of my
heart towards my other parent. As happens in such
cases, the resolution was constantly taken to return,
when I became prosperous, and must have been
welcomed back with open arms even by my father;
but my official position interposed great obstacles,

<!-- vol 3 page 205 -->

and its duties gave me unceasing occupation. I
delayed from year to year doing that which ought
never to have been put off at all; and I was roused
from this inaction by my mother's death, which left,
me comparatively little inducement to make the
exertion and return to Avignon. It was to see my
father that I went there last summer, and I found
him in a state of mind that made him wholly
unable to recognize me, and to recollect that he
ever had a son. He had been nearly in that hopeless
condition ever since the loss of Madame Lunel."&mdash;"Gracious
Heaven!" exclaimed the Countess.
"Lunel? and is that your family name?"&mdash;"My
dearest friend, it is, but I cannot comprehend
why it should make such an impression upon you."&mdash;"Had
you a brother much younger than the one
you took away with you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, but I barely can remember him.
He was only five years old when we left the country."&mdash;"Then
be assured," she said, "that there
are in this house those who can tell you more
things of that brother than you have any guess of.
Have you never heard at Nismes of a friar who
seven or eight years ago got into a dreadful scrape
in Avignon; a Benedictine Friar?"&mdash;"Assuredly

<!-- vol 3 page 206 -->

I have, but what of that? What can my brother
have had to do with Friar Isidore, or Friar Dominique,
which were the names of the two monks that
fled?"&mdash;"Of course you can tell me your brother's
Christian name (<i>nom de bapt&ecirc;me</i>)? You know he
would take another upon his profession, if he ever
became a monk."&mdash;"My dear friend, you alarm and
agitate me beyond bearing. What! Gracious God!
Was he, could he be Father Isidore? His name
was Albert."&mdash;"Then, dearest, be not agitated
more. Albert certainly is not Isidore, but he as
certainly is Dominique, and&mdash;"&mdash;"Oh! Heavenly
Father!" he exclaimed wildly, "Am I reserved for
this? A brother of mine a fugitive, wandering about
with a price set on his head, with the stigma of
apostacy tainting his name, with the mark of Cain
blackening his brow!"&mdash;She recoiled from the scene
of wounded pride, of suffering affection, of outraged
honour, which her disclosure had raised before her
eyes; she never yet had seen him moved, never
seen his ferocious passions&mdash;his feelings acute to an
extreme degree&mdash;roused and maddened. She was
alarmed at the spectacle which presented itself. She
felt as if she had caused the havoc she saw. She
grew nervous, then hysterical, and sunk on the sofa,

<!-- vol 3 page 207 -->

where her agitation found relief in a flood of tears,
and this recalled her friend to some command of
himself. He became tenderly moved to see her
strong feeling for him, and as soon as she recovered
her self-possession she insisted upon his letting her
communicate what had passed to the Count. "I
only know the outlines of this sad history," she said.
"He is acquainted with it all, and it will pour oil
into your wounds if you learn from him, as I am
sure you must, that Albert is more sinned against
than sinning, and that the honour of your family
is at all events preserved without a stain."</p>

<p>At first he hardly knew how to adopt this suggestion,
kindly meant as he saw it was, and upon
the whole, by far the best course that could be
pointed out, as a little reflection showed it to be.
His pride, his stubborn pride, raised obstacles to
any communication on such a subject with any man.
However, the entreaty of his dear friend, and the
perfect confidence which he had in both the honour
and the amiable nature of Chatillon, overcame all
scruples; and in a few hours, he returned from
his ride, when she met him on the terrace, and
apprised him shortly of the extraordinary discovery
she had made. It was agreed that he should take

<!-- vol 3 page 208 -->

a walk with the Baron before dinner, and disclose
the heads of Albert's history, without letting him
know where he was. This accordingly was done;
and the full statement of the whole transaction
removed, in a very satisfactory way, all the impressions
which the exaggerated and perverted
reports in circulation had left on his mind. "I am
far," said the Count, "from holding Albert guiltless,
as he is far from acquitting himself of blame, and
even of great blame. But, poor man, how severely
has he suffered! Is not his penance complete to
expiate his offence?"&mdash;"My dear Count," said the
haughty Baron, "I feel far otherwise; and I am
somewhat vexed that a brother of mine should feel
as much compunction as you think he does. I go
by his intention. He was desperately in love with
Mdlle. Orange; the villain who had always maltreated
him was in fact occupied in seducing her;
Albert found him, as he thought, in her presence, and
even, as he believed, in amorous dalliance with her;
she singing his cursed madrigals, he accompanying
her on his vile lute, she tenderly bidding him adieu;
he, gracious heavens, actually imprinting a kiss upon
her lips! Why, who could stand this? Who that had
not been frozen to stone in a convent, where nevertheless

<!-- vol 3 page 209 -->

letchers seemed to be hatched or finished,
could hear and all but see this, and his blood not
boil and boil over? No, no, Count, neither you
nor I could so far forget ourselves; and had we been
in his place, we should have made the same rush
that he did on Ambrose, for on Ambrose he never
doubted but he was springing."&mdash;"Well, Baron, I
will not argue the matter further; only, if he intended
to slay Ambrose&mdash;which I am far from saying
he did, rather believing that he knew not what
he intended or what he was about&mdash;but if he had so
designed I should have held the guilt of blood to be
on his head, though I admit with some considerable
palliation. Of this I am certain, that his years have
since been spent in repenting it."&mdash;"Aye, aye, he
had the severe misfortune of killing his friend, and
had he done so by the chance firing of a fowling-piece,
or, to take a liker case, by letting off a pistol
at a robber, and the ball rebounding from the wall on
his friend, he would have suffered severely, like every
man of good dispositions. But anything like blood-guiltiness
I utterly deny he lies under."&mdash;Upon the
subject of his apostacy, however, the Baron was
more harsh in his judgment. Not that he was
himself at all overburthened with religion; but he

<!-- vol 3 page 210 -->

worshipped, so he phrased it, "the Gods of the country,
as all wise men had done in all ages;" and he
felt as if his family was somewhat lowered by one of
its members leaving the national faith.</p>

<p>Finding the Baron so much relieved regarding
the main point, as Chatillon considered it, he, in
answer to the question now put, of where Albert had
gone after he left Switzerland, shortly mentioned
his wanderings in America, and his return to France,
and then ventured to tell the Baron that his brother
was actually under the same roof. This produced a
violent effect upon him; he was choked by his feelings;
he feared to shew them, and quickly left the
Count in the pavilion to which they now had come,
and hastening to his own apartment, where he met
Emmeline, he fell on her neck and found relief in a
convulsive fit of tears. She was alarmed at so unusual
an occurrence, but he put off answering her
inquiries, being always very careful to avoid whatever
could excite her feelings or throw her into any
agitation, as her health required the greatest management
in this respect.</p>

<p>Her soothing attention and sweet conversation, so
often resorted to by him to calm his troubled spirit,
so certain ever to have this effect, now as always

<!-- vol 3 page 211 -->

restored him to the entire possession of himself. He
remained when she left him, pensive, occupied with
what he had heard, revolving all his past life in his
mind, looking forward to his future lot, but chiefly
planning, not without lively interest, his brother's
escape, and looking forward with an interest as lively
to the interview he should have with him early on the
morrow, if he could not persuade the Count to break
the subject in an interview with Albert the same
evening, so that the meeting might afterwards take
place before night.</p>

<p>Lord Mornton quitted the Ch&acirc;teau to proceed on
his journey towards Italy, delighted with his visit,
and leaving all who had become acquainted with
him equally charmed. Prince Caramelli, too, took
his departure; and there remained only the Baron
and his niece with the Chatillons. It became thus
more difficult for the Count to have with Albert the
explanation so much desired by his brother, and
necessary before their meeting could take place. It
was not therefore till next morning that this could
be accomplished; and the Baron, who seldom knew
what it was to pass a night blessed with sleep, was
agitated, until he got up, with the most various and
conflicting emotions. At length Chatillon found an

<!-- vol 3 page 212 -->

opportunity of visiting the Solitary; and he easily
brought him upon the subject of his family and
their early history. He found that Albert retained
but a slight impression of his elder brother's features,
but remembered the great affection which he
had ever shown towards him, and the kind of agony
with which he came to embrace him when he went
from his father's house. This led to the Count
asking if it was quite sure Francis had ceased to
exist. There was not any doubt, he replied, that
Louis died many years ago, for a letter written in
his last illness had been received; but nothing
whatever having been heard of Francis, it was concluded
that he too had died. Chatillon then said
that he had every reason to believe this supposition
was groundless, and that Francis had prospered in
the world, but was settled in a foreign country, and
lived under a different name. By degrees he broke
the whole subject, and astonished Albert with the
intelligence that his long-lost brother was now
under the roof of the Ch&acirc;teau. The agitation into
which this discovery threw him was quickly succeeded
by another; his dread of his brother's impetuous,
proud temper, so well known in the Lunel
family, and the apprehension that his history would

<!-- vol 3 page 213 -->

excite hostile feelings towards him. But Chatillon
easily quieted all such alarms, by apprising him of
the whole having been already communicated, and
of the favourable, indeed the far too favourable, reception
which it had met with from the Baron.</p>

<p>Nothing now remained, therefore, but to bring the
two brothers together; and this was easily managed
as soon as the family went out to take the usual
morning drive in the Forest. The scene was touching;
for they met with the same affection with
which they recollected that they had parted, but the
melancholy reflection upon their mother's death,
indeed on Louis's fate also, embittered a meeting
which else had been grateful to all their feelings.
Those two afflictions, and especially the loss of their
mother, went to their heart; for both felt how cruel
it was that she should not have been allowed to witness
their meeting, that her eldest child should have
been so long lost to her, and that her youngest and
favourite son should not have been permitted to
close her eyes. These feelings heavily oppressed
the Baron; but Albert had a resource peculiar to
his own position, which soon served to occupy his
mind, and exclude any painful emotion. The position
of his brother rendered his escape a matter of

<!-- vol 3 page 214 -->

certainty and of ease. It was settled that he should
accompany the Baron as one of his suite; and the
hope was held out by this happy change of circumstances,
that he might, one day, perhaps at no
great distance, have the happiness of once more
seeing Louise, whose constancy he never for a moment
doubted, and who now less than ever could
have any difficulty in uniting her lot with his.</p>

<p>There was much care and delicacy required in
breaking the whole of these things to Emmeline,
or rather in apprising her of as much as it was
deemed right she should know. Her strict religious
opinions, and her habitual feelings of warm piety,
which formed a part of her whole nature, never a
moment absent from her thoughts, precluded the
possibility of informing her that her newly-found
uncle had left the order he belonged to, though the
Romish faith, to which she so strictly adhered, was
stated to have been abandoned by him on a full
and sincere conviction which operated upon his
conscience and left him no choice. The rest of his
history, excepting the unhappy cause of his flight,
was fully recounted by him. She believed his wanderings
to have originated in the circumstance of
his conversion, and she never wearied in listening to

<!-- vol 3 page 215 -->

the strange adventures which he related on their
journey, and the descriptions which he gave of far
distant countries, their singular manners, and their
romantic scenery. Upon points of controversy she
never would touch with him. When he once or
twice endeavoured to approach the subject, she
firmly, though with her wonted gentleness, declined
it. Satisfied herself, she desired not to re-convert
him; while she sincerely respected his conscientious
convictions, she had no desire to have that faith
shaken which made the solace of her life; for she
wisely judged that in this, as in other things, it is
good to leave well alone, and she thought it might
be dangerous to touch the opinions held on the
forms, the discipline, and the ritual of religion, lest
the substance also should be invaded.</p>

<p>On some subjects, however, which had a relation
to these high matters, and, unknown to her, came
very near Albert's case, they discoursed, reasoning
with the same freedom from all restraint which
characterized the relations between her and the Baron&mdash;relations
of familiarity and affection which were
soon extended to her newly-acquired kinsman. Thus,
as they passed through Lyons, the case of a nun
being mentioned who had quitted her convent and

<!-- vol 3 page 216 -->

fled, under the protection of a cousin soon afterwards
married to her in Switzerland, Emmeline expressed
her decided reprobation of this conduct, and would
not listen to the defence which Albert, naturally
enough, urged with some little warmth, alleging that
the poor girl was converted to the Reformed faith.
"No doubt," said Emmeline; "and she found, I
dare say, many very convenient reasons for conversion,
and for liberating herself from her vows."&mdash;"But,
my dear Emmeline," said Albert, "do you approve
such vows?"&mdash;"I am far from approving them," she
answered, "and I think, with many sound and orthodox
divines, that our Holy Church has been too easy
in giving such vows countenance and support. But
though it may be ever so wrong to make these vows,
once made they must be kept. The annoyance, the
restraint of keeping them, is the consequence of the
rash act of making them."&mdash;"How do you hold of
such (for there are many) who have been drawn or
compelled into taking the cowl or the veil?"&mdash;"Why,
my dear Secretary" (he travelled as filling this place
in the Baron's train), "that is not the question. No
one pretends that this young person did not enter
into the holy state with her eyes open. However, I
don't hesitate to say that, had I been even compelled

<!-- vol 3 page 217 -->

to make my profession, as I must have done so after
all with my eyes open to the step I was taking, I
should have held it to be only the consequence of
that act that I should perform my vows. Even had
I been what you call compelled, and even if compulsion
could here have place, I should so have
judged. The other case you suppose of a fraud, of a
dupery, is quite different; that binds nobody; it assumes
that the vow never was made."&mdash;"I fear, my
love," said Albert, "you will have, on your strict
principles, to go a step further, and consider a promise
binding which is extorted by force."&mdash;"Why,
I do go that length, dear Secretary. If I, under fear
of death or other extreme mischief, gave a solemn
promise, I should reckon the fulfilment of it to be
the price I paid for my escape. I should think it a
misfortune; but so it was my misfortune to be exposed
to the threat of violence. A consequence of
that is the keeping my promise. If I break it, there
is fault as well as misfortune."</p>

<p>The more Albert saw of this engaging person, the
more he was struck with her. The perfect justness
of all her reasonings, and the undeviating rectitude
of her feelings, could only be surpassed by her delightful
manners and tender disposition. With her

<!-- vol 3 page 218 -->

he loved to renew those discussions, on subjects both
of history and of taste, which he had found to possess
such a charm while in the society of Father
Jerome. He would relate to her the Father's critical
opinions, and he found that no subject either of
German, or Italian, or English poetry was new to
her; for of these languages she was as complete a
mistress as of her mother tongue. In discussing
Dante, he found she held the same opinion with
Father Jerome; but she rated Tasso higher than he
had done. She admitted, however, his great inferiority
to the great Florentine; and she gave Albert
an instance even stronger than the famous addition
to the lion in the Sordello. "Look," said she, "to
his murder of those most exquisite lines in the
Maestro Adamo, perhaps unequalled in their kind
by any passage of the Divina Commedia. Not content
with making the cooling and moistening rills
that trickle down the Casentino dry up the thirsty,
dropsical man, when he recollects them and has
their image before his eyes, Tasso must needs make
them heat as well as dry up; and worse still, as if to
dispel the illusion of actually seeing them before
his eyes, they are made to boil over <i>in his thoughts</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">'L'asciuga, e scalda, e nel pensier ribolle.'</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<!-- vol 3 page 219 -->

<p>I really think Tasso only succeeds when he transports
some phrase whole, and leaves it standing out
from his own verse, without adding or changing at
all, as</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">'Arabo le mani per dolor si morsie.' "</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>When they came to descant on the great French
preachers, with whom Emmeline was peculiarly
familiar, he found that she did not view Bossuet as
Father Jerome had done. She allowed Massillon to
be superior, and to have done things far above the
reach of the soft and mellifluous Bossuet; but she
took much pleasure in reading the latter, and found
his tenderness well suited to her own strong feelings
on sacred topics.</p>

<p>While thus they discoursed, the time passed pleasantly,
and the way was beguiled. In less than a
week, making no haste, they travelled along the left
bank of the Rhone to Lyons, and then ascended its
right bank to Geneva. Here Albert found that the
worthy pastor of St. Gingoulph had recently paid the
debt of nature; having survived many years longer
than he earnestly prayed he might do, his darling
Emilie; but having also enjoyed the comfort of preparing
himself better than ever for his great change
by a life spent to the end in works of charity and acts

<!-- vol 3 page 220 -->

of devotion. The melancholy disposition of Emmeline,
connected with her knowledge of the precarious
tenure by which she held her own life, made it inexpedient
to dwell on the mournful story of poor
Emilie, which came fresh into Albert's mind when
he visited the English chaplain and accompanied
him to the grave, where a simple inscription noted
the age of the deceased, and described her as "The
humble follower of Jesus, and the constant friend
of the poor." The pastor was buried at her side by
his own desire; and his death had happened too
recently to allow a stone to be erected over him.</p>

<p>The journey from Nismes, in which he felt easy
and secure for the first time these seven years, had
been delightful to Albert; and it was agreeable to
Emmeline also, whom the novelty of his conversation,
his engaging manners, and his singularly sweet temper,
could not fail to please. The Baron had not
felt so much at his ease: he had been separated
from the friend whose attractions exercised so powerful
an influence over him: but this was not the source
of the melancholy which preyed upon him. Ever
since he lost his companion and brother, Louis, he
had felt all the blessings for which he was grateful
to Providence were each in succession accompanied

<!-- vol 3 page 221 -->

with a bitter reflection&mdash;"Alas! <i>he</i> is not here to
share what would have given him so much pleasure!"
This journey with Albert was fitted to raise up such
regrets at each step; to which might be added the
unceasing source of his greatest anxiety, Emmeline's
health, never becoming less delicate, but on the contrary
rather giving more rise than in her earlier years
to gloomy forebodings. Hence it was his fate to have
his cup of enjoyment ever dashed with bitterness; and
as Emmeline never appeared more delightful, or filled
him with more pride than during this journey with
her new kinsman, the Baron was proportionately
downcast when the murky shadow flitted across him
which he seemed to foresee would one day veil so
much excellence from his sight.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p class="small">REVOLUTION&mdash;GENERAL AND PERSONAL.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Baron and his suite having passed through
Switzerland returned to Flanders; the other guests
of the Ch&acirc;teau arrived at their several homes; the
Marquess and Marchioness continued to dispense
among their dependents the blessings which a resident
gentry affords, and among their neighbours the
distinguished and distinguishing hospitality of Bagnolles.
The same party had agreed to re-assemble
at the close of the ensuing summer; and in the
mean while public events did not linger in their
progress. The States General assembled in May.
The people of Paris were enchanted with the august
solemnity of their public meeting. The plan of M.
Necker having been adopted, no less than twelve
hundred representatives of the three orders were
convened, of whom six hundred were deputies of the
commons, and the remainder represented the nobles

<!-- vol 3 page 223 -->

and clergy. The minister's plan, his foolish plan,
of leaving to the bodies themselves the determination
of all other questions, was likewise pursued, and led,
after a few weeks of fierce controversy, to the union
of the three in one meeting, a narrow majority of the
other two having been, chiefly by the violence of the
multitude out of doors, induced or compelled to
vote for this inauspicious junction. The Revolution,
according to Lord Mornton's wise and sagacious
prediction, was thus accomplished, and the Monarchy
in effect subverted. What soon after followed might
be regarded among the natural consequences of this
cardinal error. But the excitement of the people,
and especially of the Paris mob, broke forth in acts
of violence. An easy prey to every rumour fabricated
for the purpose of inflaming them, by working
on the most suspicious temper of which the history
of nations affords any example, and working also
on an ignorance of all beyond the circle of the
Parisian walls, hardly credible in the eighteenth
century, those multitudes who had now begun to
give over all other occupation but that of political
agitation, were driven to and fro by their profligate
or fanatical leaders&mdash;'tis hard to say which race is
the most pestilent&mdash;and had already, before the

<!-- vol 3 page 224 -->

assembling of the States General, proceeded to the
most unbridled excesses. Property had been pillaged,
houses burnt, lives lost, before the ominous
month of May set in. One act of violence after
another ensued; and on the 14th of July the Bastile
was attacked, and carried by storm. M. Necker,
whom in one of its oscillating fits the Court had dismissed,
was recalled, and soon found that while the
mob rent the air with their shouts of exultation at
his return to place, they were resolved to give him
none of the power, without which place is a disgrace
to him who holds it, and a curse to all under his
rule. The Paris mob, now made regular&mdash;what
was called <i>organised</i> in the jargon of the day, that
is, disposed in clubs of agitators&mdash;ruled the Assembly
by terror; and the Assembly did as it list, or
rather, as the mob list, without the least regard to
the minister.</p>

<p>Early in August the time had arrived for assembling
again the delightful society of last year at the
Ch&acirc;teau de Bagnolles. The Count and Countess
were there as relatives of the family, some weeks before.
The Chevalier had left France for England
after the revolutionary movement of July, when it
seemed no longer expedient for an Englishman to

<!-- vol 3 page 225 -->

remain in Paris; his son Ernest was glad, too, of an
occasion for quitting the capital without giving rise
to any suspicions against his patriotic dispositions;
and he promised to let his father know how he found
matters at his aunt's, on his arrival. The Chevalier
Deverell accordingly was in anxious expectation of
receiving a letter, and about the middle of August one
reached him, dated the beginning of the month, but
which had gone round by Yorkshire, whither he had
been to visit a friend. He read with extreme interest,
and in some annoyance, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="right">Ch&acirc;teau de Bagnolles, 2nd August, 1789.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dearest Father</span>,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I lose</span> no time in fulfilling the promise
I made on parting with you a fortnight ago, after the
alarming events which induced you to prefer an
English to a French residence for some time to
come.</p>

<p>"Yesterday evening I arrived here after dinner,
and found our last year's party in a great measure
reassembled. My aunt and her family received me
with their wonted cordiality. All the company were
distributed in their several parts of the salon so
nearly as they used to be last year, that I could

<!-- vol 3 page 226 -->

almost have thought the interval of nine months
had not been interposed, and that we were all as
then the evening before the party broke up and dispersed.
There was the Marquess playing at chess
with the Count, in the recess as you go towards the
library; there was the Marchioness with her book
on the sofa between the parlour door and the great
mirror; the governess and the Sieur Gaspar were
looking over the new prints and maps for the school-room;
the Rev. Mrs. Leblanc, as you used to call
her, who is here on a visit, was walking about the
adjoining part of the library, with a stranger, whom
I had not before seen, a tall man of a most handsome
and striking countenance, who seemed discussing
with her some important matter, that both took
great interest in. The Countess was reading the
newspaper in the niche near the chimney-piece; and
the Baron sat a little way off, neither reading nor
talking, which, however, at the moment did not
strike me as anything particular. I saw, in short,
every one exactly as last year, with one exception.
Mdlle. de Moulin's place near the small book-case
was vacant; she was not there. I looked again at
the Baron, and was going to ask whether she was
unwell, as not unfrequently happened. Mercifully

<!-- vol 3 page 227 -->

I did not; I perceived he was in deep mourning,
and that his face was care-worn, as if he had lived
not nine months, but twice as many years, since we
last met. The dreadful suspicion instantly passed
through my mind, and I dared ask no question.
My aunt, who sat near, at that moment happened
to raise her eyes from the book in her hand, and her
look of sorrow and despair as she eyed first me and
then the unhappy Baron, too eloquently told me all
that remained&mdash;if indeed anything did remain to
be ascertained. The vacant place gave my heart
such a chill as I am unable to describe. I durst
not again turn my eyes toward it.</p>

<p>"I cannot express to you the gloom which this sad
event has cast over the whole society. There never
in this world was a more delightful or more amiable
person than Emmeline de Moulin. I say nothing
of her wretched uncle, now the very picture of woe,
but I speak only of herself. So much talent and
so admirable an understanding&mdash;such a rare union
of the qualities generally found the least capable of
blending together, warm and quick feelings with
calm and correct judgment&mdash;so much of heart
with so much genius and information&mdash;such expansion
of mind with such perfect innocence and simplicity&mdash;that

<!-- vol 3 page 228 -->

all this should have passed away, and
left only our sorrow for its loss, is I really feel a
severe dispensation! You will not wonder at my
thus writing, because you know that all my Parisian
nonsense used to be dissipated the moment Mdlle.
de Moulin appeared, and that she exercised over
me a kind of power wholly unaccountable, whether
you regarded my nature or her own; my general
hardness and carelessness (<i>insouciance</i>), or her habits
and temper, which rendered anything like love-making
or even ordinary admiration a thing as
much out of the question as it would have been
with my aunt or her children.</p>

<p>"Well, when once such melancholy sentiments
take hold of the imagination, they do not leave any
portion of it unoccupied: I walked out before breakfast
this morning, after thinking very much of what
I have been detailing, both before I fell asleep and
after I got up. I found myself walking among
the lime-trees, beyond the terrace, after you pass
through the pavilion, and I sat me down on a bench,
beneath the shade of one of them. It instantly came
into my mind that I last saw poor Emmeline on
this very spot, and that she had gently chid me
here for some stupid joke which I had made upon

<!-- vol 3 page 229 -->

her young friend, Mademoiselle Chapeley. You
may recollect she never much liked any remark on
the absent, but especially could not bear it on her
friends. Just as I was saying to myself&mdash;How
much would I give that she were here to chide me
once more! I heard the note of the small bird
which frequents the lime-tree-walk&mdash;a shrill and
plaintive note&mdash;as I had often heard it when she
was there enjoying her favourite walk. I can hardly
tell you the pang that this gave me. No one is so little
given as I am to sentimental moods: no one cares
less to have his mind led away from realities to
such painful sufferings or indulgences, call them
which you will. But it was too much for me; I was
fairly overcome, whether from having slept ill, or
been fatigued with my journey, or having eaten
nothing since I rose, or whatever be the cause, I
caught myself fairly moved to tears, and was exceedingly
glad to find, upon looking round, that I
was unobserved. Had the Countess, or indeed any
one that knew me, observed what was passing, it is
my belief they would have thought I either had been
drunk over-night, or was deranged this morning. I,
of course, soon recovered myself.</p>

<p>"At breakfast we all again met, except the Baron.

<!-- vol 3 page 230 -->

He has only been here these three days, and my
aunt (who indeed mourns over Emmeline as if she
had been her own) tells me that he has been unable
to bear the morning meeting as yet. He used every
day, after breakfast, to lead his niece into the portico,
and there to converse with her on their little plans
for the day, of reading, or walking, or driving, and
the Marchioness says that this recollection is stronger
than for some days he may be able to bear. You
know the pride, not to say haughtiness of his nature.
He is as high in his affliction as in any other concern
of his life. My aunt tells me no one dares
approach the subject to him, within a hundred
leagues. He is entirely sullen, silent, and reserved.
But his looks he cannot command; he is an entirely
altered man, and if he ever smiles, it is like the
grin of a death's head. His coming here, the Marchioness
says, was an immense exertion, and was
imposed upon him by his brother, as a kind of duty,
in the belief that it might tend to banish the sorrow
he was secretly and silently pining under. You
know she is somewhat of the most innocent in
worldly matters&mdash;like poor Emmeline;&mdash;and she
never seems to reflect that the dearly beloved
Countess is here, whom the Baron durst no more

<!-- vol 3 page 231 -->

have disobeyed, when commanded to attend, than
he durst the commands of his lawful sovereign the
Emperor Joseph.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;that same brother of his, whom I mentioned,
as the only one of the party I had not seen
before. He is truly a most remarkable person.
First and foremost, the handsomest man, without
exception, I ever saw; and herein as little like the dear
Baron as may be&mdash;but a man of great accomplishments,
extensive travel, and various knowledge.
Lastly, one whose conversation is singularly agreeable&mdash;having
great suavity with much fire, a ready wit,
and a good capacity for reasoning. He has, however,
some of the particularities of the family, and
he consented to accompany the Baron, upon condition
that he should be allowed to occupy his own
apartment in the Ch&acirc;teau, and only join the party
when the family were alone. He is, it seems, a
Protestant, and having come down in the evening,
without knowing Madame Leblanc was there, she
seized upon him, as he was about to retire, and making
the Marchioness present him to her, began a
controversial discussion with him, which he could
not avoid, but fled from to his own chamber, as
soon as he had an opportunity of escape. It seems

<!-- vol 3 page 232 -->

to me, from one or two things I have incidentally
observed, that there is a good deal of mystery attending
these two brothers, and this younger one
especially. He is very intimate with Chatillon,
who quite swears by him; the Countess too extols
him about as much as she does the Baron; but
neither the one nor the other can give me much
information respecting either brother, or if they can,
they certainly prefer keeping it for their own private
and separate use.</p>

<p>"I have, in the course of the morning, seen only
those I mentioned at the beginning of my letter.
The gossip of the place I can give you but a slender
report of, having only seen your reverend friend for
five minutes in the portico, before the company
assembled after breakfast. She availed herself of
that limited space to lament the poor Baron's loss.
'And,' said she, 'misfortunes never come single.
He came here to be comforted by meeting the
Countess, and he finds he has lost her too.'&mdash;'Lost
her?' I said, 'What can you mean?&mdash;'Oh
they are manifestly two;' she replied. 'Not that
he cares a straw, I imagine, for it seems he suffers
so much, that he cares little what now may befal
him. Nevertheless, I cannot excuse her taking this

<!-- vol 3 page 233 -->

opportunity of throwing him over.'&mdash;'But,' I said,
'I don't believe one word of it. The thing is
utterly impossible!'&mdash;'Quite possible,' said she,
'and quite true.'&mdash;'But what account do you give
of it?' I asked; 'there must be some cause.'&mdash;
'Oh, I conclude she has found him a successor.
He was not her first love, and is not very likely to
be her last.'&mdash;I need hardly tell you that this last
matter&mdash;this explanation&mdash;must be false, whether
the rest of the story be true or not. I came as near
the subject as I durst venture with herself; but,
owing to an accident I need not trouble you with,
she hates me so cordially, that she never even tries
to conceal it, and she would hardly speak to me with
common civility, when I asked some question respecting
her friend, the Baron. With himself, of
course, I did not venture to approach the subject.
My observation, therefore, as confirmatory of the
tale put forth by her 'who thinketh no evil,'&mdash;that
she does not speak out, is confined to the remark
that I have not seen the two bosom friends take their
accustomed walk to-day, and that they did not read
together in the library during the morning. Possibly
they may resume their studies after dinner.</p>

<p>"We are all here, in as much anxiety as you may

<!-- vol 3 page 234 -->

suppose, for the next accounts from Paris, The
wise predictions of Lord Mornton are fulfilled to
the very letter, and in all their particulars. Revolution
is fairly begun; where it is to end, or whither
it is to go, wiser heads than mine must determine.
I find the spirit of the people in Languedoc and
Provence is to the full as bad as in any part of the
north&mdash;indeed, from all I hear, it is even worse.
The accounts from Orange, Marseilles, Toulon, are
truly alarming; but nothing can be much worse
than our neighbouring town of Nismes. A most
turbulent spirit prevails there; scenes of tumult
ending in bloodshed have already been acted; the
Catteaus are full of hopes, activity, and fury, with
a ferocious rabble at their heels; there have been
attacks on the ch&acirc;teaux and on the persons of some
proprietors, though not in this immediate neighbourhood;
but at Nismes, I hear, there are clubs established
on the model of those begun in Paris, and
that persons are denounced for political offences;
that private grudges are at work in many cases
to have men's spite gratified under the mask of
patriotic enmities; that even secret information is
received by agitators, and acted upon by their
mobs; and of one thing I am sure,&mdash;that if the

<!-- vol 3 page 235 -->

rabble knew what a thorough- going aristocrat your
humble servant is, no hiding-place in this Ch&acirc;teau
would be dark enough or fast enough to screen him
from them, and prevent him assisting the illumination
of the place by ascending the lamp-post (<i>lanterne</i>).</p>

<p class="right">"Your affectionate son,</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Ernest</span>."</p>

<p>The first news which arrived at the Ch&acirc;teau after
Ernest came, was that of the memorable 4th of
August, a day wholly unexampled in the history of
governments; and by governments we mean the
deeds of a regularly established power regularly
acting in the management of the affairs intrusted
to their care; but not, perhaps, without example in
in the history of the violent revolutions, and the
sudden convulsions which the moral, as well as
the natural world sometimes undergoes. In one
night sixteen laws were passed by acclamation, and
with hardly any discussion at all, each of them
of great, most of them of the greatest importance;
altering the whole civil polity of the country,
changing the relations of society, violating the most
valuable rights of property, placing the whole administrative

<!-- vol 3 page 236 -->

system upon a new foundation. Many
of these laws were improvements of the utmost value;
almost all of them were fit to be in some shape or
other introduced; but their sudden, hasty, wholesale
adoption without any regard to details, without
the least care to prevent serious injustice in their
operation, and without the shadow of consent from
those great bodies whose interests they affected, consent
to be asked by previously consulting them, or
at least informing them of the intended measures,
was a course of headlong and precipitate action
which deserved not the venerable name of legislation.
The abolition of all that was oppressive in
feudal rights, the equalizing of all public burthens,
the vesting in one central body the imposition of all
taxes, the cessation of all provincial states, and the
conversion of the clergy from a proprietary into a
stipendiary body, were the principal measures, all
of the utmost benefit to France, thus carried by the
violence of the moment, and which no subsequent
deliberation could alter and modify.</p>

<p>But, although in the excitement of the day, the
leading nobles and dignified clergy at Paris had
rushed forward to make these great sacrifices, the
same enthusiasm was very far from prevailing in

<!-- vol 3 page 237 -->

the provinces among the classes whose property had
thus been given away. In Languedoc there was
not the least disposition even to acquiesce; and the
nobles, finding that the peasantry were deluded into
the notion, not perhaps, very unnatural after what
had passed in the capital, that all rent was to cease,
and that all common land was given up to them,
broke out into disorders still more violent than they
had lately committed, and obliged the landowners
to arm in their own defence. The Marquess de
Bagnolles, though he cheerfully bore his part in this
resistance, to which the country owed its escape
from universal anarchy, yet never ceased to cast
the blame of the commotions which had rendered
such defensive operations necessary, upon the precipitate
measures of the National Assembly; and
he plainly saw that now it was vain to think of
arresting the progress of Revolution.</p>

<p>"I find," said he as he returned from the meeting
held to take steps for a general arming, "I find that
the most unmixed delight has been given at Nismes
to the violent party by the late proceedings. There
is now a confident expectation entertained of an
entire change in our monarchy."&mdash;"That hardly
surprises me," Ernest observed, "for how and

<!-- vol 3 page 238 -->

where are men to stop who thus begin? What
chance have we of nobility, of orders of knighthood,
indeed of any distinction of rank being maintained
after what has passed with respect to all feudal
privileges?" The Count did not view the matter
quite in the same light; but a remark of the Baron,
who sat silent and as if absorbed in the book he
was reading, but had listened to the conversation,
seemed worthy of great attention. "The Tiers
Etat have been persuaded into giving up on their
part their only chance of being ennobled; for the
sale of parliamentary and other judicial places is
abolished with the feudal rights. Depend upon it
the Commons never would have agreed to this had
a month's time been given for reflection."&mdash;"And,
pray, what do you infer from hence, M. le Baron?"
said Mdme de Chatillon, somewhat contemptuously.&mdash;"I
infer, Madame," said he, "what I presume any
one of ordinary understanding, who gives himself
the time to reflect, and does not prefer the easy
success of a trenchant remark to the trouble of
seeking after truth, would naturally infer, that the
Commons being the powerful body will indemnify
themselves for the involuntary sacrifice, in the most
obvious quarter, that is to say, by levelling all

<!-- vol 3 page 239 -->

ranks."&mdash;"That, in short," said Ernest, who perceived
the profound reasoning of the Baron, "unable
any longer to rise up to our rank, they will bring us
down to their own."&mdash;"And, after the night of the
Fourth," added the Baron, "why should I doubt
that the privileged orders will be themselves forced
to propose the change?"&mdash;"All extremely deep and
far-sighted, I make no question," said the Countess;
"we ordinary mortals don't see so long before us."&mdash;"Countess,"
said M. de Moulin, in a tone somewhat
severe, and with a sardonic smile, which had anything
rather than an amiable effect, "Countess, possibly
you ordinary mortals would find your sight longer
if you had experience of affairs, as well as much
study, and had learnt the lesson of endeavouring to
profit by these opportunities." So saying he left the
portico, where the party were assembled, and took a
walk alone upon the terrace.</p>

<p>Ernest plainly perceived that there was much
foundation for his former suspicions; these two
friends were no longer on their former footing; and
he found in the course of the evening that Madame
de Chatillon, when she ventured upon a remark to
the Baron, did so with much hesitation, and was
answered with that immeasurable superiority of

<!-- vol 3 page 240 -->

which he was as conscious as the others were aware,
no longer bending to her authority as her inferior,
nor indeed, at all affecting to treat her as his equal.
She seemed to be exceedingly ill at her ease, and
Ernest saw, but had no means of divining what, that
something very desperate and perverse must have
taken place between them so entirely to alter their
mutual relations. The Baron's state of mind would
not in any manner of way explain the change. In
affliction men cling to any friendly support, rather
than abandon their attachments; and being of a good
heart himself, Ernest believed both that the Baron
would seek and that the Countess would be inclined
to yield him that kind of solace. Hardened as he
was by the ways of the world, he still could not conceive
the likeness of anything in the female form
taking this opportunity to abandon her former friend&mdash;yet
something, he could not tell how, or what, must
have happened between these two. Of one thing he
was quite certain, Madame Leblanc's doctrine could
not be true. He had far too extensive and accurate
a knowledge of the female nature to doubt that her
love for M. de Moulin was a kind of caprice, or
wandering from her accustomed path; he believed
it had never gone far in this instance; he was quite

<!-- vol 3 page 241 -->

certain it never had been repeated in any other; and
his conjecture from all he observed, was that it had,
at least for the present, ceased.</p>

<p>Ernest was right in the main, though he saw
imperfectly. He was right in believing that a
change had come over the friends, and that no new
attachment had caused it. He was not quite correct
in his view of the fair lady's disposition. His
knowledge of female nature had been limited to
ordinary samples of the sex. Of the species to
which Madame de Chatillon belonged, fortunately not
a numerous family, he had as yet had no experience.
That which he conceived impossible for anything
in the female form to accomplish had been perpetrated;
but only the form of the party was female&mdash;and
what lurked beneath that fair form? Was it
fury or was it fiend? or was it only a human nature
exposed to strong gusts of passion, and drawn on
from step to step by chances that presented opportune
suggestions, after the perilous discipline
of familiar contemplation?&mdash;This, however, if it may
explain, never shall be suffered to excuse; for this
is the way in which the Great Fiend of all works.</p>

<p>The long absence which the Countess had feared
might relax the Baron's attachment, if not wean

<!-- vol 3 page 242 -->

him from it, had proved much more fatal to her
own. In him the passion of love was natural, not
to say habitual; in her it was now first felt, and it
found no easy or convenient harbour in her bosom.
The pride which formed the great feature of her
character was offended, because it was lowered by
it; and therefore, never having easily suffered its
entrance, was exceedingly watchful for an opportunity
to expel the intruder. The stings of remorse,
however, were added to the wounds of pride; they
were indeed far less powerful; and she often represented
to herself the feelings she endured as emotions
which were only pride. Still remorse did
operate sometimes and somewhat. Yet the master
passion was pride; its wounds gave the real pang.
The accident of which she had so fatally become
aware, that had put Ernest in possession of her
secret, continued to give her unspeakable pain, and
as, from his known opinions of the sex, the fruit of
his equally well known experience, she had no doubt
that he believed matters to have gone much farther
than she ever intended they should; she could also
entertain no doubt that he was ready any day to exhibit
her, if not generally among his idols, at least
to the goddess of the day, in colours for laying on

<!-- vol 3 page 243 -->

which she felt her conduct had given an authority.
The knowledge that she was in the power of two
men, both men of the world, was more than she
could endure. Aloof from all intimacies she had no
confidant, and took no counsel. One friend, if she
had possessed such a treasure, might have soothed
her, and reconciled her to her position; another of
an opposite caste of mind might have advised her to
break off all connection of the kind. She formed
the latter resolution of herself, in a temper of mind
which arose partly from wounded pride, partly from
awakened conscience, and in no small degree also,
from dread of discovery, however determined she
was that there should be no actual guilt to find out.
That which made it possible for her to form first,
then to execute such a resolution, wholly beyond
her force a few weeks ago, was the effect produced
by absence in relaxing her attachment.
Her love for the Baron was contrary to her
nature and habits, and when they were separated,
and she could not look forward to a renewal of
their intercourse for many months, she found
it possible, without any great effort, to get the
better of her passion, and she was effectually cured.</p>

<p>About a month before Chatillon had determined

<!-- vol 3 page 244 -->

to revisit Languedoc, she heard of the cruel blow
that had fallen upon her friend and laid him prostrate.
His letter was short, but it expressed all.
He was alive; he unhappily was well and likely to
bear about the burthen of an existence become
utterly wretched. He hastened to tell her this,
noways doubting of her sympathy, though not a
tender word did he mingle with his phrase, not an
approach did the few lines of his letter indicate, to
any other feeling save that which might well be
expected to fill and to master his soul. By a contradiction
common to women, and which one little like
the rest of her sex could yet exhibit, this letter,
though it excited little sympathy, stayed for awhile
the execution of her purpose. She felt less able to
abandon her friend and cast away her passion,
when she thought for a moment that he too had
been cured. Instead of writing to him, therefore,
she reserved the communication of her resolution
till they should meet at Bagnolles, and for awhile
she inclined to withhold that communication until
she should have ascertained that his love burnt with
as fierce a flame as before; nay, she did not exactly
know if her own might not be re-kindled should his
be found to have died away.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 245 -->

<p>They arrived at Bagnolles,<sup id="r024"><a href="#n024">24</a></sup> a week before the
Baron. When he came, she found him sullen and
reserved to others and refusing to confess that he suffered;
dejected in her company, but as affectionate
as ever. The momentary partial renewal of her passion
ceased; and in answer to his declaration that the
hope of again meeting her had been the only gleam
his mind had been enlightened by, and that he had
now but one attachment remaining upon earth, she
told him with a firm voice, and in a manner even
haughty as well as determined, that all intimacy
between them must cease, and that she had formed
a resolution from which nothing could move her.
This shock was more than the miserable man could
well bear. Nor was its force lessened, by her
replying, in answer to this remark, that he had
really looked for sympathy from her instead of
repulsion,&mdash;"If you mean pity, you should scorn it.
For my part, I can't bear to be pitied. I had rather
be hated by far."&mdash;With that she flung out of the
room, determined to hear no more; and had she
stopped to listen, she would only have heard muttered
in an agony, "My God! what a woman!"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 246 -->

<p>He cast his recollection back, at this moment, to
the very different person in whom his affections had
centered, now torn from him by death. He was
moved to tears as he had not been since his loss,
when the contrast struck his mind. He had, without
any blame to himself, suffered his mind to be once
and again diverted from the sad scene before his
eyes during her last illness; he had found relief by
this distraction, and by resting his thoughts on
what he fondly but vainly had been dreaming would
prove a sympathizing bosom. He now bitterly upbraided
himself for having suffered a single instant
to pass with his attention removed from what was
passing before him; it seemed to him as if he had
deserted in thought the death-bed of her who
before all the world continued now so unspeakably
dear to him; and he could not avoid the feeling
that he was justly punished for what yet was a
natural, nay an involuntary offence&mdash;while he sighed
out again, as he gazed on the door through which
the Countess had flung, "What a woman! gracious
heaven! Was it for her that I deserted, though only
in thought and but for a moment, the dying hours
of that sweet angel, while she was passing to her
eternal rest?"</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 247 -->

<p>The cure of the Countess was certainly not
more radical than this short scene had effected on
the Baron. In the composition of the remedy there
was less pride; there was some little remorse, though
also less of this. But there were affections the most
powerful and most lasting, as they were the most
pure which could sway the heart, and these expelled
his passion from it, at once and for ever, with the
help of the discovery he had now made, that the
other spirit was not kindred to his own.</p>

<p>It was not long before the Countess found how
entirely this had been accomplished, nor was it long
before she was doomed to feel the consequences of
the change. Not merely there was no devotion to
her&mdash;there was not the ordinary submission of a
man to a handsome and a distinguished woman.
Not only there was no intimacy&mdash;almost all intercourse
had ceased. For a day or two her pride
kept her up, her spirit supported itself; and possibly
so might it have done had she been alone in the
Ch&acirc;teau with M. de Moulin. But she had now to
bear the change which all perceived in his manner
towards her, and above everything else in his apparent
estimate of her authority and her reasonings,
her fancies and her opinions; and as she had now the

<!-- vol 3 page 248 -->

means of judging how much of his former deference
had depended upon her real merits, so also had
every one else access to the data upon which the
same calculation proceeded; all could now make the
deduction of amorous devotion from the sum total
of the submissive respect paid, and tell to how much
the remainder really amounted. It was not very
agreeable for herself to work this question in subtraction;
it was still less pleasant to observe
others occupied with the same exercise of vulgar
arithmetic.</p>

<p>The strength of the hatred that arises from the
transmutation of love is proverbial. She now detested
him she had but lately loved; and no day
passed without giving herself and the rest of the
party a variety of examples whereby to learn the
same easy and elementary rule; for she got to be
exceedingly restless under the irritation of her present
position: she could not avoid rushing into conversations,
however moderately she might be qualified
for grappling with the subject. She had been spoilt
by admiration, and had lived upon it; and, like a
princess, had not been enough accustomed to the
more homely and wholesome diet of unpalatable
truth. Hence she fell into the error of thinking

<!-- vol 3 page 249 -->

that a sentence, or a jest, or a fine look, or a gracious
smile, can carry things; and omitted the consideration
that knowledge, and the wisdom coming from
practical experience, always win the day in the long
run; but in the hands of a dexterous combatant
carry away the victory at once, and leave the lighter
artist floundering and laughed at.</p>

<p>One day the conversation had turned on the state
of the market for land, and the thousands of estates
intended for sale and no purchasers offering for them.
Madame de Chatillon, in answer to the Marquess,
who held this a fatal symptom of the revolutionary
rule, said, "Why, no one has seen England flourish
the less for her Revolution last century, and the
Civil War some years before. No doubt property
changed hands then as now."&mdash;"There being," observed
the Baron, "very certainly no change whatever
in the distribution of property either at the one
period or the other."&mdash;Some one spoke afterwards
most justly of the influence exerted by the Clubs and
the Galleries over the proceedings of the Assembly.
Her eyes sparkled at the prospect of regaining her
advantage. "I suppose," she said with a haughty
sneer, "there are no Whig Clubs in England, and
no Galleries in their House of Commons."&mdash;"Assuredly,

<!-- vol 3 page 250 -->

Madam," the Baron quietly replied, "none,
nor anything like it. The Whig Club is a private
association of persons of rank, which never debates
at all; and the Gallery of the House of Commons
is cleared at the desire of any single member: no
one is allowed to utter a whisper during its discussions."&mdash;"Well,
well, it may be so; women are apt
enough to be led away by a word being the same,
as children will look through a telescope, holding it
the wrong way, and wonder to see it reflect diminished
instead of enlarged objects."&mdash;"I suspect
neither women nor children are very likely," said the
Baron, "to see such a telescope as you mention
reflect anything at all."&mdash;"Why, how so. Baron?
There is no getting you to admit anything, either
fact or comparison. Does not every one who has a
looking-glass, and is not ugly enough to dread,
using it" (looking archly at her quondam friend)
"know as well as I do that the glass reflects?"&mdash;"Certainly
not, Madam, it is the quicksilver behind
it that reflects, the glass transmits only and protects
the metal; not to mention that, if the glass reflected
ever so much, this would not prove that there was
any the least reflection in such a <i>refracting</i> telescope
as your ladyship spoke of. However, I beg your

<!-- vol 3 page 251 -->

pardon," he added, feeling he pursued her too close,
"I was wrong to set you right; it was not worth
disputing about." There was something in the
mingled scorn, indifference, and almost pity, with
which this was both sounded and looked, that proved
far more intolerable than any of his exposures which
preceded. She bit her lip in a manifest agony of
mortification; and, taking a book in her hand, retired
from the portico.</p>

<hr/>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p class="small">THE END.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> these things were transacting in the public
society of the Ch&acirc;teau, Chatillon passed much of his
time with Albert in his own apartment, or in rambling
over the forest; sometimes visiting together
the cave where their acquaintance began, sometimes
going among the peasants in the neighbourhood, or
the foresters who lived in the woods, hearing their
opinions of passing events, and inquiring into the condition
of their families. The Marquess, though an
excellent landlord, yet had estates so extensive that
much of their management was necessarily devolved
upon agents, and as the Sieur Gaspar was become
old and less active than formerly, his subordinate
functionaries were not always well looked after.
Many valuable hints were therefore given by these
two friends to the benevolent and sensible owner of
the domain.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 253 -->

<p>But the Count, while conversing with Albert, always
recurred to one topic, whether in their walks,
or in their evening interviews at the Ch&acirc;teau. He
could no longer see any reason for refraining from
the attempt to bring off Louise, which he had in
vain pressed before the discovery of his friend's
relationship to the Baron. His circumstances were
now comparatively flourishing. The unhappy calamity
that had just befallen the family rendered
their fortune much greater than their wants. No
chance existed of his brother marrying; it was the
very last thing he ever was likely to think of; nor
could he have otherwise than the wish to see Albert
united with Louise. Chatillon soon found that it
was only his habitual submission to the Baron's will,
and his feeling apprehensive of his displeasure,
should a subject be broached which he had never
himself come upon, that rendered Albert unwilling
to take the course pressed upon him. His friend at
once undertook to remove this difficulty, and begged
the Countess to take an early opportunity of bringing
the whole before her friend, as Chatillon still supposed
him. She gave, however, the most peremptory
refusal to interfere in any way, and expressed an
entire indifference to the "lovers, Don Alberto and

<!-- vol 3 page 254 -->

Donna Luigia," as she termed them, laughing not a
little at the romantic adventures of Chatillon's "dear
friend," their friendship furnishing constant food for
her merriment. He was thus obliged to broach the
subject himself with the Baron, and he found not the
least disinclination to the proposal, only a positive
desire that, considering his own station, he should
in no way be mixed up with any step which might
be taken.</p>

<p>The Count having now obtained Albert's full
assent, proceeded to lay his plans, and he did so
with the greatest judgment. He was to go, without
any attendant whatever, to cross the Rhone near
Orange, and then proceed by the diligence to Avignon,
so as not to have the appearance of coming
from Nismes, the inhabitants of which labour under
general suspicion in the Cont&acirc;t. He was to take up
his position at once in an inn of the town, and from
thence to reconnoitre the persons of the Orange
family. He was provided with a letter from Albert,
and his first object must of course be to have this
safely conveyed into Louise's hands. Never having
seen her, he could only make inquiry respecting her
habits, or, which he much preferred, watch about the
door of Madame Orange's house, in order to see her

<!-- vol 3 page 255 -->

come out. He did not venture to trust any one
whom he might bribe to deliver the letter. But
after waiting two days, he at length saw her enter a
carriage with her mother, and from the description,
he had not the least doubt of her identity. He
watched another day, in the hope of her walking
out, but he could only see her at the window for a
moment. He instantly looked up, and held the
letter in his hand. A few minutes afterwards her
maid came down, and into her hands he delivered
it, with a note from himself intimating that he
should be ready to meet and to save her at six next
morning, outside the gate, on the road leading to
Orange. He went there in a close carriage which
he had hired at the hotel, and she came by the time
appointed. He ordered the postillion to drive off at
a quick pace, and was perceived and stopped by a
guard of the Vice-legate, or deputy governor residing
at Avignon. The man was insolent, but Chatillon
put a purse of silver in his hand, and in a minute he
had galloped off to Orange. The journey was
speedily performed, the river was crossed, the
Avignon carriage dismissed, and in a few hours the
fugitives were safely landed in the Ch&acirc;teau, no one
having been able to tell which road they took after

<!-- vol 3 page 256 -->

Orange; for the Count had the foresight to station
his own servant at a country inn out of the main
road from the Rhone, and they went thither, a distance
of above a league, on foot, when they got into
his carriage, and finished their journey. It was settled
that Louise should come to the old steward's
house in the wood, in order not to commit the Marquess
and Marchioness. She was to remain there for
two days, till their plans were arranged.</p>

<p>The meeting of the two lovers was exceedingly
affecting. Louise at length found her friend safe
from all immediate personal risk, powerfully protected,
and amply provided for. The contrast
between his present situation, and the circumstances
in which they last had met, a year and a half before,
came forcibly into her mind, and she devoutly
prayed for grace to make her both thankful for such
blessings, and rightly and moderately to enjoy
them. Albert, though his spirits continued much
affected by his recent loss, and though his present
enjoyment was disturbed by the ever-recurring sigh
of reflecting that poor Emmeline could not share
their felicity, yet deeply felt the happiness for which
he had so mercifully been reserved, and only had to
keep down the alarm that from time to time would

<!-- vol 3 page 257 -->

intrude of other terrors still being in store to dash
away from his lips a cup so sweet, but so lately
tasted. The Baron was pleased with Louise, and
desired to have the marriage hastened with all convenient
speed. But Albert, after much reasoning on
the subject, judiciously preferred travelling with her
to Flanders, and being there married at a convenient
distance from both the Cont&acirc;t and Nismes. It was,
all the time of the discussions, a cruel thought, ever
present to the Baron's mind, that she was no longer
here whose judgment on all points would have been
consulted, and whose wishes on all points have
ruled. Indeed, time seemed to have none of that
healing influence which it is so common to speak
of. Stunned with the blow that felled him to the
ground, he had at first not felt its full force. He
now experienced what it was to suffer in every
feeling of the heart, and at every moment of time.</p>

<p>The Countess gave herself little concern in all
these transactions. Wholly engrossed with her feelings
respecting the Baron, whom she now regarded
both with hatred, and distrust, and alarm; she could
only think of the unconnected expressions which she
had at different times heard drop from him upon
the effect which he knew the loss of Emmeline, a

<!-- vol 3 page 258 -->

calamity always haunting his gloomy imagination,
would be sure to have upon the tone of his mind.
He was wont to say carelessly that he should probably
survive it, because no one dies of grief any
more than of love, but that it was his own fault if he
survived it long. No one could compel him to lead
a life of torment, and he had no family, nor indeed
any person living, now his mother was taken from
him, to whom his loss would prove an injury. She
used to rally him for such views of futurity, and to
say he surely was too proud to let the world see he
had no power to endure calamity. "May be so!
may be so!" he would reply, "but who pray told
you that the world was to know it? I am quite
equal to meet that difficulty, I promise you." Then
she also brought to mind his way of speaking once
when they were discussing in the portico the history
of Themistocles, and his practice of carrying poison
in a ring was mentioned with some incredulity.
"For that matter," said the Baron, "I believe I
could charge a much smaller ring than the ancient
warrior's was, with poison enough to relieve any
three men of their load of life." These, and such
speeches as these, came constantly into her mind now,
and as often as she saw him sitting with his eyes

<!-- vol 3 page 259 -->

fixed upon vacant space&mdash;or glaring at some page of
a book for half an hour together, shewing that he saw
not a letter of its print,&mdash;or caught him sitting idle,
contrary to all his habits, and then suddenly begin
to occupy himself as soon as he was discovered&mdash;or
heard him when he forgot himself, or perhaps supposed
no one nigh, heave a deep, convulsive sigh, and
then on being observed, begin a kind of hysterical
cough, she could not refrain from laying all he now
seemed to undergo together with his former predictions
and half threats, and to look forward to his
speedily fulfilling them and putting them in execution;
insomuch that her lively imagination, ever
under the guidance of her wishes, and always running
much before the event, made her ask eagerly
about him as often as he was later than usual in
entering the breakfast-parlour, or returning from his
solitary walks in the forest, and still more when he
went to Nismes, and remained till after the company
had left the salon and retired to rest.</p>

<p>Day after day however passed, and nothing
happened. The great fear of her existence and
its most intolerable annoyance was the Baron;
his death, she had worked herself up to believe,
would take a load off her soul; would dispel the

<!-- vol 3 page 260 -->

cloud that hung over her existence. She longed
for it far more impatiently than ever did expectant
heir who is himself sinking into the vale of years
while his predecessor lingers on the brink of the
tomb long yawning to receive him; till at last her
mind was completely familiarized with this idea,
and her impatience became such as would have been
something ridiculous, had it not also been something
horrid to think of. Her disappointment when young
Deverell's accident proved unexpectedly trifling, was
great, and it was little concealed. But this impatience
now for what she called "a necessary relief,
and the emancipation from intolerable thraldom, to
which she was fully entitled," was tenfold; it was
all the more vehement, that it was mingled with a
degree of rage and of constraint, of which in the
former instance there had been hardly anything. It
was then only fear; it was now greater fear coupled
with hatred and revenge.</p>

<p>While in this dreadful frame of mind, and just
before Albert set out for Flanders, she one day came
into the library, and perceived on the sofa in one of
its recesses, the Baron stretched out fast asleep with
a book half cut before him, and in his hand an open
penknife. Unable to sleep well at any time, and

<!-- vol 3 page 261 -->

now nearly a stranger to that refreshment in the
night, he not unfrequently fell into a slumber after
his walk was over in the course of the morning.
The family were all gone to Nismes; and she knew
she was alone in the house; she suddenly saw how
a wound inflicted with a knife, such as to produce
instant death, would be ascribed to his own hand,
when he was found in that posture, and when his
frequent conversations on self-destruction were
coupled with the present state of his spirits, which
all his efforts to conceal what passed within him
had never succeeded in preventing the company
from fully perceiving. She hurried to Chatillon's
room for a razor; she returned; she found him still
undisturbed; he had never moved since she went;
she grasped the razor in her hand; she looked
round&mdash;and saw Albert who had come into the
library during her absence, and who stood now clear
of the division of the recess which at first concealed
him from her view. She suddenly and with
an hysterical laugh said she was minded to try the
strength of the Baron's consistency in his own doctrines,
by placing a razor within his reach, well
assured, she carelessly added, that his life would be
in very safe keeping, when committed to his own

<!-- vol 3 page 262 -->

hands. Albert fixed upon her his large and piercing
eyes: he uttered not a word; she stood abashed
and unable either to speak or to stir; the Baron
was awake and knew not the subject of their discourse;
Albert retired, but before he went, he shook his head
slowly and significantly over against the Countess, on
whom he continued to glare with his widely opened
eyes. She left the room before the Baron had time
to begin any conversation. But next morning when
he saw Albert before his departure, he asked what
Madame de Chatillon and he had been disputing
about, and was surprised to hear his brother say,
"I believe her to be nearly the worst woman in the
world; why I only say nearly, I will tell you; I
think her as bad as any one can be without being
false." Nothing now much interested M. de
Moulin; however, he asked what his brother could
mean; and when told that, from what passed the day
before, he verily believed she was seeking his life,
"Oh, if that is all," said the unhappy man, "I
am sure she is perfectly welcome. I defy her to be
half so willing to take it as I am to give it. However,"
he added with an indifferent tone, "why
should she be in such a hurry? Let her wait a
very little time, and the pear will be ripe, and fall

<!-- vol 3 page 263 -->

into her lap of itself. I once thought that grief
was a slow poison; my opinion is altered. I now
feel, thank God, that it brings its own only remedy
much quicker than I had believed."</p>

<p>The grief that such observations, and the calm,
indifferent, and yet truly despairing manner in which
they were made, gave Albert, could only be alleviated
by the hurry into which his approaching departure
threw him. He sincerely loved and indeed
revered his brother, to whom he looked up as to a
superior nature, and he felt the cruel blow which
the loss of him would be to all the prospects he had
begun to form of future happiness. But before he
set out, it seemed absolutely necessary that he should
take some steps for the Baron's protection. That
any one, a woman especially, should have deliberately,
or even suddenly under the influence of a
momentary temptation, formed the wild project of
murdering him with her own hands, and by an act
of violence, seemed quite incredible. Yet that the
idea had passed, through her mind he could not for
an instant doubt, and drugs might be used, or
accomplices might be hired when no one was by
to watch or to detect. He accordingly took the
Marquess aside before he went, and explained to him

<!-- vol 3 page 264 -->

his apprehension, finding it quite in vain to make
his brother attend seriously to the subject for a
moment. The Marquess turned almost as deaf an
ear to the representation as the Baron had done,
and Albert departed with a heart full of anxious
forebodings, though he really after all supposed it
very possible he might be mistaken.</p>

<p>The scene which she had gone through in the
library had thrown the Countess into extreme agitation.
It had made her congratulate herself on the
escape she had made; for she could not avoid feeling,
that a moment later, and a deed would have
been done, at any rate an attempt would have been
made, of which a witness was unexpectedly present,
and her character, if not her life, was then gone.
She, however, experienced another effect of that scene,
and of the part she had played in it. The second
step had now been made towards blood-guiltiness.
The first was her open, her almost avowed disappointment
at Ernest's life being preserved last
autumn; this had first made her familiar with the
thirst for a fellow-creature's blood. The same
thirst had again seized her in the instance of the
Baron. Another step in her progress downwards
had now been taken; she had all but slaked that

<!-- vol 3 page 265 -->

infernal thirst; she had committed murder in her
heart, and murder with her own hand. When she
reflected on these things, she was shocked&mdash;she
stood aghast at the contemplation of her own image;&mdash;she
started back from the gulf that yawned before
her; but she speedily laid all these fears and all other
feelings asleep by reflecting on the risk she ran, the
certainty of ruin she called it, from both the Baron
and Ernest. She was haunted day and night with
the loss of the character she had so long maintained
of being the only beauty of Paris that never had
been even suspected; she figured to herself the
sneers of some (over whom she had been wont to
exult), hard to bear, and the pity of others more intolerable
still; she hastily decided that she had no
choice; she argued that self-defence required her to
act; she put the question as between the destruction
of these her relentless oppressors, and her own; and
she concluded that the first law of nature gave her,
the right, nay, imposed on her the duty, of providing
for her own security, at all hazards and all costs.
She resolved, however, to proceed henceforth with
redoubled caution, and never to act herself when she
could by any means safely use another hand than
her own.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 266 -->

<p>Ernest again gave his father a short account of
what was passing at his aunt's, in all whose concerns
the kind-hearted Chevalier took a great interest.
"We have had here," he said, "a most
agreeable, and indeed, a remarkable man, of whom
I think I before made mention, a brother of the
Baron. He is well read, and far-travelled, but he
neither overlays you with his books nor his adventures,
though willing enough to be asked as to
either. In short, you would like him much; for he
would not treat you as those lay-preachers do, of
whom you complain that there is no escaping them,
their brethren of the cloth being confined to both
time and place. Apropos of that race, it is well for
you that you dined not here yesterday. Courdemont
opened a new vein, sprung an unexpected
mine upon us. Well&mdash;you, after all, never really
knew what he is made of. He is an accomplished
genealogist, and I see you turn as pale as this paper
at reflecting on the escape you have made, like a
man who, in the morning, sees the precipice or the
bottomless pool he had unawares passed in the dark.
He got upon this endless topic yesterday with the
soup, and I question if it was run out before the
coffee. Charlemagne and Attila range themselves

<!-- vol 3 page 267 -->

like disciplined troops in his niches, when he goes
out through the Couvelaunts and the Coryphines,
and others, his ancestral walks. Be thankful for
the special mercy of your escape. It is provoking
that one cannot hate so learned, able, and honourable
a man, as he deserves to be hated; but so it is,
and this lies on one's conscience. The Baron is as
when I last wrote. He tries to occupy himself with
hard work, but it won't do. His brother, whose
tender care of him resembles that of the most affectionate
wife or child, says he never will be able to
take the only cure, of hard labour, till he returns to
Flanders, and has public duties to perform; and
return he clearly will before many days are over;
for between the lady and him all is over, most certainly.
Not only is there no longer alliance; there
is not even neutrality, hardly peace and common
forbearance; nor does she seem aware how much
better it would be to be quiet in the new circumstances.
Her restless nature, her endless ambition,
and her morbid pride, get her into constant struggles,
and she has, of course, always the worst in the conflict.
Her opinions, to judge by her way of talking,
have undergone a great change; she has become
quite a stout revolutionist; she is all for the popular

<!-- vol 3 page 268 -->

party; won't suffer a word to be said against M.
Catteau, whom she terms a very clever and interesting
young man; goes to Nismes to meet him, and
hear the news from the Paris agitators, who are, she
says, regenerating France; and speaks slightingly of
such plodders as the Chief Judge and M. Balaye,
who are not worthy to be named in the same year,
I suppose, with your Catteaus. You know she
never can hope to meet this gentleman at her cousin's,
for he long since forbade him the Ch&acirc;teau after
some of his blood-thirsty speeches. To all we can
urge on this topic, the fair stateswoman replies:&mdash;'Other
times, other maxims. We have outlived
all that sort of thing.' The Baron, one day, drily
said, we had as yet outlived them, but we might not
long be able to say as much. The friendship of her
husband for the Baron's brother is very remarkable;
they seem to be quite inseparable. The
Count went for a few days over to Avignon, upon
some business, and his friend appeared to reckon
the hours till he came back, wondering, each time
any one arrived, what had become of Chatillon.
The Count, again, is now in equal pain for the loss
of the Fleming, who suddenly set off for his own
country two days ago, not that Chatillon is as

<!-- vol 3 page 269 -->

nervous and uneasy as his friend had been during
his absence, but this arises from his far more easy
temper. The Fleming has all the fire and excitement
of the South, which one could hardly have
expected to see bred in the Low Countries."</p>

<p>This, alas! was one of the last letters poor Ernest
ever wrote. The wish of the Countess, the daily
and hourly wish, was at length gratified, and she
was rid of one of the burthens that made her life
hateful. But she was rid in awful circumstances,
full of suspicion, and which led to tragical events.
A number of anonymous letters had been received
at the Ch&acirc;teau, warning its inmates of the proceedings
which were going on in Nismes, and at Orange,
between which two places there was constant correspondence,
the mob being almost equally excited in
both. The Marquess was warned to secure his
Ch&acirc;teau from an attack, and to have his woods and
outbuildings well watched, for fear of fire at this
season, when all in the South is dried up by the
heat. The Baron was probably deemed safe, as
being a foreigner, and in high station under his own
government, under Joseph the Second too, a favorite
of the French regenerators, and termed by them,
"<i>the Imperial Avant-Courier of the Great Revolution</i>."

<!-- vol 3 page 270 -->

But Ernest, whose aristocratic habits and
connections were known, and who exposed himself
by his venturing at all hours to ride about, and be
seen everywhere in the town, was very positively
told of his danger. One of the letters mentioned
that he had been denounced at a club more than
once; that information had been conveyed from the
Ch&acirc;teau itself of his speeches, contemptuous towards
the people and their leaders, and that Catteau had
a friend there, and the people a friend, who let nothing
escape. Young Deverell held all such anonymous
hints very cheap, and would not alter his mode
of living. The old steward provided guards for the
forest, and had the peasants ready to answer the
summons of the bell, in case the Ch&acirc;teau should be
assailed. But Ernest would take no precautions,
and indeed the Baron and the Count, when he consulted
them, were much of his mind, saying there
was no end of trouble, if you minded anonymous
letters, which nine times in ten were written for the
mere purpose of giving you that sort of annoyance.
This, however, proved to be the tenth time, and the
warning which was thrown away came from those
who knew the facts. A furious mob, urged on by
the Catteaus, against whom he was reported to have

<!-- vol 3 page 271 -->

dealt in sarcastic jests, set upon him as he rode
proudly through the streets of the suburb next Bagnolles.
He defended himself gallantly; then attempted
to escape; he was hit with a large stone,
thrown from his horse by the blow, which stunned
him, trampled under foot by the multitude, and
expired in a few minutes, after being carried into a
cabaret, by a policeman, who saw the scuffle, but had
no power to save him. The mob, that day, were
masters of Nismes, and only dispersed upon the
troops being called out, when later in the evening
there was a threat of setting fire to a baker's shop,
the master of which they had nearly beaten to
death.</p>

<p>The Countess at first seemed elated with this sad
intelligence, and retired to her own apartment, leaving
the Baron and the Count to offer such consolation
as they could to the unhappy young man's aunt.
She bore her own part of the calamity with that
pious resignation which her religious feelings and
her habitual devotion made a second nature. But
she sighed over the poor Chevalier, wrapped up in his
son, declining in the vale of years, and unable, in his
solitary state, and far off from his sister, to struggle
with this most heavy affliction.</p>

<!-- vol 3 page 272 -->

<p>The Marquess felt strongly, but he also recollected
Albert's parting speech concerning the Countess.
He laid all the circumstances together; the visits to
Nismes, the new intimacy with Catteau, the anonymous
letters hitting at least upon one truth, that
Ernest had spoken lightly of the mob and its leaders,
abusing Catteau by name. Caspar had told him that
he had observed Madame de Chatillon occasionally
directed letters in a printed hand, which she never put
into the post-bag, but carried them herself to all appearance.
Above all, warned by Albert's suggestions,
though slighted at the time, he had looked at the
Countess when the sad intelligence arrived, and had
perceived an unseemly animation light up her whole
countenance. All taken together made him both
believe Albert's former account, sharing his strong
suspicions on that occasion, and made himself entertain
a strong suspicion upon the present event. He
never much liked his kinswoman, or rather his
kinsman's wife; he liked her now much less than
ever; and he fairly told the Marchioness that he
cared not how soon she left the Ch&acirc;teau, and left
them to their sorrow, which plainly she did not
share.</p>

<p>But the Countess was doomed to suffering which

<!-- vol 3 page 273 -->

neither they nor herself had foreseen. As soon as
the first excitement had ceased, an agitation which
she understood not succeeded. In the evening, the
men as usual met, the Marchioness keeping to her
room. The Countess had thus a good excuse for
also absenting herself. But her evening was spent
differently from her wont; she was wholly unable to
read or to write; her pen, as often as she took it up,
fell from her hand; her eye, fixed on the page, saw
not the words; on she read to the foot, and knew not
a word she had read; she went to bed&mdash;she slept
not; her eyes were hot and ached, but they would
not close; she took a calming draught&mdash;it only made
her wander and speak without coherence; she knew
not what she said; she could not fix her mind for
an instant on one subject, and when the morning
arrived she seemed in a high fever. Chatillon sent
instantly for advice; the doctor came, and pronounced
that the fever would be of short duration.
He proved to be right; and she was able to appear
at breakfast in two days. It was, however, her turn
now to receive anonymous letters, and one came
which threw her into an agony of terror. It enclosed
one which she had herself written in a printed hand,
and plainly told her to send some money to the

<!-- vol 3 page 274 -->

writer, else he would let the Marquess know of her
correspondence with the agitators. She had been
seen to put a letter in the post-office; it had a
printed direction; and thus her correspondence was
traced. That letter contained an account of Ernest's
political violence on all occasions. She saw staring
her in the face all the horrors of a discovery;
she sent the money required; she felt that she was
the slave of the anonymous correspondent; and she
now discovered that a woman may be guilty of even
worse acts than having a lover.</p>

<p>Fear sometimes opens the eyes which have been
closed to more worthy warnings. But her feelings
were not naturally bad; they were not naturally
callous; they were only perverted by ambition, and
seared by pride. She now felt that the event which
she had so wished for, so rejoiced in, was the source
of unmingled grief and vexation, because it was the
source of regret; she would have given worlds to be
relieved from the load of that catastrophe for which
she had sighed as the only means of relieving her
from other, far lighter evils; she would almost have
given her own life that Ernest were still alive.
How lightly did she now think of all the risk she ran
from his tongue! How little would she now care

<!-- vol 3 page 275 -->

if all Paris had witnessed what he had seen in the
Orangery! How lightly did she now regard even
the most criminal intercourse with the Baron, compared
with the charge to which she was now exposed!
One comfort, and one only, she had; she
never could be grateful enough to Providence for
the accident, which she had formerly considered one
of the curses of her existence, the chance of Albert
being in the library and saving her from a yet
heavier load of guilt than now oppressed her soul.</p>

<p>But daily agitation now gave place to broken
slumbers, or wholly sleepless nights. Her appetite
was gone; her restlessness was a disease; her alternation
of ceaseless talk or sullen silence excited
general attention; her face was changed; the roses
had forsaken her cheeks; her eyes were sunk and
were restless, or were glazed in her head; she never
remained a moment in one look, or in one posture.
Chatillon, deeming that the fever had been ill cured,
or was returning again, sent to Montpellier for the
physician who had attended Madame de Bagnolles.
He came, and at once pronounced it no case of fever,
at least at present, though from certain symptoms
he conceived that brain fever might be approaching.
He ordered the most perfect quiet, and living in a

<!-- vol 3 page 276 -->

darkened room, and being kept low. He remained
a day, and then returned to Montpellier. She in no
way appeared to mend, and the doctor was sent for
again. He now said, on examining the symptoms,
that he had no longer any dread of cerebral illness;
but he inquired minutely into her former history,
and especially wanted to ascertain if either she or
any of her family ever had laboured under mental
alienation. The answer was clear and decided in
the negative. He then wanted to know if she had
ever lost any child, or had any other affliction to
prey on her spirits. He was told she never had
a child at all, and no one knew of anything to afflict
her, unless perhaps it might be the shock arising
from Ernest's sudden fate. The physician said she
always wandered upon something which oppressed
her, and seemed alternately under great alarm or
in much affliction. He ordered her to be most
carefully watched day and night, and gave his opinion
to the Count that her mind was seriously disturbed.
It was a conclusion to which he had himself already
come; but he hoped that her natural faculties were
so strong as to throw off this present malady. The
doctor shook his head, and assured him that this
was a feeble reliance; for that it was less likely a strong

<!-- vol 3 page 277 -->

intellect should recover its tone than a feeble one,
inasmuch as the illness must have been proportionably
strong to affect it, Chatillon calmly said,
"God's gracious will be done; but it is a grievous
blow." He now for the first time in his married
life regarded that as a blessing which he had ever
deemed one of his greatest misfortunes&mdash;the having
no children.</p>

<p>The unhappy woman grew worse and worse.
Her mind was now entirely gone. She raved much
of the Baron and Albert; but of Ernest she spoke
with scarcely any intermission. Sometimes she was
seized with fits of fury, more frequently she seemed
under the influence of terror, and occasionally she
would burst into tears. Once or twice she spoke of
poor Emmeline; and the Marchioness was infinitely
touched to hear her one day sighing and crying
out! "Oh, Emmeline Moulin! Emmeline Moulin!
What would I give to be at peace in your grave!"</p>

<p>Before this sad catastrophe had befallen his unhappy
friend, the Baron had left the Ch&acirc;teau, and
proceeded homewards. The letters from Albert
announced his marriage having taken place, and
that their happiness only wanted his presence to
complete it. He felt, however, too miserable to

<!-- vol 3 page 278 -->

enjoy anything, and only set out mechanically because
it was going to his home, to what he now
called his wretched home. But at that deserted and
melancholy home he never arrived. In the bed of
the inn of Montelimart, he was found dead by his
servant when he went to announce that the carriage
was at the door. The man was closely examined
by Albert when he brought to Brussels this melancholy
intelligence. It seems the Baron had not
been able to sleep even his usual moderate portion
of time for two or three nights before he left the
Ch&acirc;teau; and the servant had thought him more
depressed than usual during the day on which they
left Montelimart. He had even (a thing most rare
with him, who never spoke to his servants) heaved a
sigh as he sat down to his supper, and seemed to
feel distressed at the thoughts of returning to his
house near Brussels, where he should no more see
his niece. He retired to rest at the usual hour;
and the man saw no more of him till he found his
corpse next morning in the bed stiff and cold. A
phial was on the table close by the bed; it was
empty, and had a kind of smell, the man said, not
like laudanum, but more like bitter almonds.</p>

<p>Albert too clearly perceived that his brother had

<!-- vol 3 page 279 -->

terminated a wretched existence by swallowing' one
of those subtle poisons of which he would sometimes
speak half seriously, half in jest. It was a severe
affliction, but he could not upbraid himself with the
neglect of any precaution against what he yet had
always foreseen to be an event very probable; for
he full well knew him not to be a man whom any
precaution that could be taken would prevent from
executing a fixed purpose.</p>

<p>This sad loss threw a gloom over the happiness
of the new married pair. But at their age, in their
circumstances, the spirits are buoyant. The Baron
had left them his whole property; he had left them
also the respect attached to his name; and they had
before them a life which promised as much comfort
as ordinarily falls to the lot of mortals, though at
moments of enjoyment they would cast back a
thought of sorrow at no longer having their beloved
brother and niece to share it.</p>

<p>They had the better assurance both of the purity
and the duration of their happiness, in the deep
foundations of religion and virtue upon which it was
built. In the sad events that had preceded and attended
their union, they had lamentable examples before
their eyes how frail are all the tenures of a mere

<!-- vol 3 page 280 -->

worldly texture by which sublunary felicity is holden.
All that beauty and rank and talents could give
had not been able to make Madame de Chatillon's
prosperity secure, nor had her high spirit, animating
too a frame naturally cold, been able to
defend her against the insidious approaches of a
passion which fervent piety in women most easily
subdues. She had never, it is true, departed from
the path of virtue in act or deed; no sooner was she
roused to a sense of her danger than she turned
her back upon the precipice that yawned close to
her feet; and she might have been saved, had religion
come to her rescue, from afterwards falling
before other worse temptations against which she
was less on her guard. But even in her earlier
day she had approached far too near the brink.
She had suffered the vanities of the world and
the splendours of worldly success to entangle her
in a connection which her conjugal duty forbade;
an attachment which, though sullied by no actual
guilt, was yet pointed towards a guilty quarter,
and had no meaning if to that consummation it
did not tend. Her punishment had been signal
and severe. Losing all self-esteem, she was haunted
with the terror of losing also the esteem of the

<!-- vol 3 page 281 -->

world in which and for which she lived. Her
better nature left her; her feelings became perverted;
her moral sense was unhinged; she no
longer gave to vicious actions their due shares of
disapproval, of blame, of reprobation, of abhorrence.
One idea alone filled her whole mind.
One fear beset her. She was blind to every risk
but one. She thought but of a single crime and
a single shame. Had she been anchored to the
Rock of Ages, she would in repentance have worked
out the cure of that pain which she had brought
upon herself, and not plunged into guilt incomparably
deeper than any with which she could be
charged&mdash;a greater guilt incurred to hide a lesser
shame. Her punishment had again been dreadful.
She was driven to madness by the tortures, the
unbearable tortures of conscience wringing, as it
does, and tearing the soul in all its most sensitive
regions with sleepless terrors, with self-upbraiding
to lacerate or to sting, with pity that only burning
consumes the soul and never melts it, with the awful
aspect of the dark future, and the unbearable glance
of the Eye that is too pure to behold iniquity.
Before this assiduous, this never-resting tormentor,
her reason had fallen, and the pride of that matchless

<!-- vol 3 page 282 -->

understanding, once the admiration of the
world, had been bowed to the dust, laid prostrate
by the crimes to which an over-weening confidence
in its powers had prepared the way.</p>

<p>There was another example before the eyes of
Albert and Louise, which, though less striking and
less terrible, yet touched them more nearly. The
Baron, far less criminal, had not been without his
share even of the Countess's guilt; and all their
admiration of him could not conceal from their calm
reflection that he too had sinned, that he too had been
punished. Accustomed to regard men in the capacities
in which he had worked with them, or governed
them, or opposed them&mdash;as his tools, or his subjects,
or his enemies&mdash;to be used, to be ruled, to be fought or
be circumvented&mdash;he had far too little viewed them
as his fellow-creatures; and however well disposed
to promote their happiness or further their improvement
in the mass, he had acquired the convenient
and easily formed habit of considering them as
bound, in return for his good offices towards the
species, to contribute individually towards the gratification
whether of his ambition or of his other
passions. The code of his morality thus became
exceedingly imperfect; it was a morality of the most

<!-- vol 3 page 283 -->

worldly and most relaxed description; and though
his vices were accompanied, they could not be redeemed,
by many virtues; his pride gave him the
notion either that he was above all temptation or that
when he yielded there was no cause for shame or
necessity for repentance. But he had fixed all his
purer affections upon one object; their wounds had
been the bane of his life; their final disruption he
had been unable to survive. So strong a mind as
his sank under the blow from which feebler natures
daily recover; and unsupported by true piety,
though far from being an irreligious man, he had
quitted voluntarily the post which his Maker has
assigned him. Albert sometimes upbraided himself
with having made no attempt at ministering
consolation to his brother from the only source
whence it can be drawn so as to possess a healing
virtue. But a conviction that with such a nature
such a trial would be hopeless, had always withheld
him from what plainly was a vain effort. He felt,
too, deeply impressed with the reflection that there
was one passage in his story to which his brother
might well refer as worse than any portion of
his own; a passage which no length of time nor
any variety of enjoyment was ever likely to erase

<!-- vol 3 page 284 -->

from his memory, or to let him feel that it had been
sufficiently atoned either by repentance or by amendment
of life.</p>

<p>If the contemplation and the recollection of these
things were calculated to give him pain, there was
one subject to which he never could recur without
the most delightful though the most tender and
melancholy impressions. He would describe to
Louise his niece's perfections, dwell on her genius,
her sense, her purity, her resignation, her saint-like
but charitable piety, with unceasing rapture, and
would oftentimes exclaim, that surely if ever an
angel visited this earth, it was Emmeline Moulin.</p>
