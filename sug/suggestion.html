<h2>SUGGESTION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Extract from Miss Margery Hawthorne's
Diary</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The</span> last entry made in this dear little book is
the record of my engagement to Rex. How happy
I was that night! I felt I must write down all
about it before I went to bed. I wonder whether I
am really the lovable creature Rex thinks I am, or
whether it's his fancy? How can I ever know!
It doesn't matter, so long as he fancies it, for that
is enough for me. How I love him! It makes
my heart stop beating and then jump on again only
to think of him. I didn't know it was possible to
love anybody so much. And what a dear good
fellow he is! He says such lovely things&mdash;I
couldn't write them down here, it would make me
feel hot, but it is so delightful to remember them&mdash;things 
that make me feel as if I were the only

<!-- page 6 -->

woman in all the world worth looking at, and certainly 
the very sweetest that ever lived. He can't
mean it all of course, that's impossible, because I
know I'm not. It's just his way. But oh! I do
hope he means some of all he says, for it makes me
feel so proud and happy to fancy anyone can think
of me like that.</p>

<p>"However, I didn't sit down to-night to write
about Rex, though it's very hard to write or even
think about anything or anybody else. But this
little locked book of mine is a real diary&mdash;what I
call a diary that is&mdash;not a record of every-day
doings but of special-day doings. When any
extraordinary event happens to me, I like to
write down all about it here before I forget
what it felt like. I wish it was something about
Rex I had to write down to-night, but there's no
such luck, for he wasn't here this evening. All
I have to record is an odd new experience which I
don't want to forget.</p>

<p>"We had two or three intimate friends here at
dinner; one was Oliver Heriot. He's oddly like
Rex sometimes, and yet so different! I can't

<!-- page 7 -->

say I like him, though I have seen so much
more of him than of his brother, Rex having been
in America so long. But Oliver seems to me lazy
and selfish, while Rex is the most unselfish fellow
that ever lived. Of course I may be wrong, but
that's how I feel. And in this little book, when I
do take the trouble to write in it, I may as well
tell the truth.</p>

<p>"We got up a game of willing and wishing in
the drawing-room after dinner, as somebody had
been reading an article in one of the magazines
about hypnotism, and we all began wondering
whether there was anything in it or whether it was
all nonsense. Of course papa laughed at us and said
it was all nonsense certainly; and of course he was
longing to try it on me and see if he could get the
best of me. So after dinner we began like silly
creatures. Papa wouldn't rest satisfied unless I
was the first one sent out of the room and be the
first one to see if he could make me do what he
wanted when I came back. But of course he
couldn't, though he walked me about with his hands
on my shoulders for ever so long, and everybody

<!-- page 8 -->

sat round and laughed at us. I didn't feel anything 
at all. Papa got quite cross and said I was
no good; so somebody else was sent out. But
there was no success with anybody till I went out
again and Oliver Heriot tried with me.</p>

<p>"When I went into the room I felt quite certain 
he could not do anything with me, and that
the whole thing was nonsense. Then he came
and put his hands on my shoulders; after a minute 
he took them away, and coming in front of me
stood and stared in my eyes. And then without
knowing I did it&mdash;and that's what annoys me so!&mdash;I 
did the most foolish thing, a thing I never
supposed anybody could have made me do. Right
before all those people I went up to Rex's photograph, 
and actually fell on my knees before it and
then kissed it. Could anything be more utterly
foolish? I don't wonder everyone laughed at me!
It makes me furious to think of it!</p>

<p>"But how is it I didn't know I had done it till
I <i>had</i> done it? That's what puzzles me so&mdash;I
don't want to forget that. If I try any more experiments 
I'll write down all about them as they

<!-- page 9 -->

happen. For it's very strange to do a thing like
that without being even aware of the least thought
in one's mind about doing it.</p>

<p>"I was furious with Oliver for making me do
such a silly thing. Still, it was Rex's portrait and
nobody else's!&mdash;that's one comfort."</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> young men were sitting smoking over a
bright fire blazing in a harness-room. This room
was as cheerful, as warm and as pleasant as any in
the mansion known as Heriot Hall, to which the
stables belonged; and with these two young men
it had always been a favorite lounge. But on
this occasion there was a certain feeling of awkwardness 
which had never existed before. This
arose from the fact that hitherto these brothers,
the two young Heriots, had been equally free of
their father's house; but now Rex Heriot came
out from the billiard-room, while Oliver entered
the stable-yard from the drive. And both knew
that Oliver could not go into the house; furthermore 
that his father would be infuriated if he were
found to be in the stables. Yet his favorite mare
stood there in her stall; and the two hunters he
had ridden last winter. His rooms in the house

<!-- page 11 -->

were still littered with his especial belongings, his
guns were on their accustomed racks; his setter
lay basking in the heat of the fire. But Oliver
himself was an outsider.</p>

<p>He had come home from Paris a week ago, and
after dinner on the first evening of his arrival, had
an interview with his father which ended in his
leaving the house again the same night and going
to sleep at the village inn. By which means it
immediately became known to all the neighbors
and the whole country side, before noon the next
day, that "Old Heriot" and his son Oliver had
quarrelled.</p>

<p>Rex was treated to his father's view on the
matter, in full, and in instalments, which made it
more irritating if possible than the punishment
would have been otherwise. As he strolled into
the harness-room, Oliver, who was there first,
thought he had never seen the handsome face
so tired and worn-looking.</p>

<p>These two brothers in some respects were as
much alike as if they were twins. When one met
them walking in the road side by side, or watched

<!-- page 12 -->

them enter a drawing room together, the likeness
between them was quite remarkable, although
Oliver was two or three years older than Rex.
Their movements and gestures were very much
alike; both tall, broad-shouldered, well-built men,
with fine features, bright hair, blonde moustaches
and keen gray-blue eyes. In appearance they
almost reproduced each other; in character, those
who knew them well, thought them complements.</p>

<p>"You look bored, old man," said Oliver. "I
suppose the governor's been going on at you
all the time?"</p>

<p>"Yes;" said Rex, and paused; then added
with emphasis, "without intermission."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for you," said Oliver in a tone of
sympathy; then with a dark look on his face,
"you pay pretty dear for your post of favorite."</p>

<p>It was said with a sneer; and an onlooker
would have expected Reginald to retaliate. But
he made no answer. He leaned against the mantelpiece 
and took a cigar out of his case, with a
languid air of a man who was too used to his
companion to take any notice of him.</p>

<!-- page 13 -->

<p>Rex had inherited his mother's temperament;
gentle, cheerful, good-humored. His father's
irascibility and Oliver's peculiar temper, simply
wore him out, perplexed and worried him, so that
he allowed them to say all the disagreeable things
and answer themselves. This quiescent attitude
irritated Oliver beyond everything; for by it Rex
had become master of the situation. Always his
father's favorite, long since his right hand in
business matters, Rex was now his father's
heir.</p>

<p>Since his stormy interview of a week ago with
Oliver, Mr. Heriot had made a will leaving all his
enormous possessions absolutely to Rex. His
lawyer had come down from London on purpose
to draw up this document, which he had carried back
and had deposited safely in the Heriot strong-box.</p>

<p>"Now, thank Heaven," piously ejaculated old
Heriot about a dozen times a day, "my money
won't be gambled away over the card-table, spent
in pot-houses, and flung in the gutter. Mark my
words, cutting off that young blackleg with a
shilling is no loss to him; for if he were as rich

<!-- page 14 -->

as the Duke of Westminster he'd be down to the
shilling all the same in a year or two."</p>

<p>The fortunes and positions of these two young
men, were, it will be seen, considerably changed
since they had last lounged away the afternoon in
the harness-room talking of the dogs and horses.
Little else had they in common to talk of, for they
had not the same tastes. But they had always
been good friends, having that idle, indifferent
sort of almost physical affection for each other
which healthy, happy young people who have
lived much together generally acquire. Oliver
was an excellent story-teller, and knew how to
adapt himself to his audience; many a merry hour
they had spent in this room, laughing over his anecdotes.</p>

<p>To-day there was a constraint and a gloom which
had never existed between them before. And
their faces almost lost all likeness from dissimilarity 
of expression. Rex, who, by sheer inoffensiveness 
of character, had walked into the most
desirable position possible, looked like a victim.
Oliver, the outcast, had an air of resolution about

<!-- page 15 -->

him which became him well. The dark shade that
crossed his face sometimes and the smouldering
fire in his eyes, Rex simply put down to temper&mdash;that 
Heriot temper that he was so tired of!</p>

<p>"Well," said Oliver after a moment's silence,
"the old man has got somebody to abuse now to
his heart's content so long as he lives, I suppose.
That ought to make him happy. Hang it all, if I
can see the difference between the way he's made
money and the way I've lost it; we're both gamblers; 
only he is successful and I'm not."</p>

<p>"Quite a sufficient distinction for him," observed
Rex.</p>

<p>"And for me too," said Oliver bitterly. "Well,
you've got all the luck now."</p>

<p>"And you've had it," said Rex, quietly, but
quickly.</p>

<p>"True," agreed Oliver. For he had been his
mother's favorite. Mr. Heriot in his earlier will,
had, he thought, favored Rex too much in some
respects, though practically he had divided his possessions 
pretty fairly between his two sons. But he
had long been aware of the difference in character

<!-- page 16 -->

between them, and consequently had not left
Oliver much ready money. Mrs. Heriot had a
fortune of her own and showed her partiality&mdash;as
she thought, her justice,&mdash;by leaving it to Oliver.
She had died about a year since; that year had
been cheerfully occupied by Oliver in making away
with the fortune in question.</p>

<p>"Quite true," he repeated; "but at all events,
I've done you an uncommonly good turn. You
can't deny <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"That's as we look at it," said Rex. "I'd a great
deal rather, for my part, that you would make it
up with the old man. Life isn't worth living as
things are at present."</p>

<p>"Make it up with the old man!" echoed
Oliver. "My dear boy, how's it to be done?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," said Rex wearily, "unless 
you like to turn over a new leaf. But, of
course, even so, he wouldn't believe in you."</p>

<p>"Not he!" said Oliver.</p>

<p>"What I mean is, no gain to me can compensate 
for all the row. I can't stand living at home
as things are. I think I shall get him to send me

<!-- page 17 -->

out to California again. I'd rather be by myself
out there, than in such a pandemonium as you two
manage to create."</p>

<p>"Really?" said Oliver, with an air of innocent
inquiry, "and what about Margery Hawthorn?"</p>

<p>"Well, what about her?" demanded Rex, turning 
round on him, and taking his cigar from his
mouth.</p>

<p>"Will she like it?"</p>

<p>"Is that anything to you?"</p>

<p>"Dear me, no; only a general interest in the
subject. By the way, that brings me round to
the very question I wanted to see you about. I
dined at Hawthorndene last night, and Sir Charles
made me an offer. You needn't look so amazed;
though I don't wonder. However, this is the
whole of it. He had heard, like everyone else, of
all the row here. He asked me if it was true what
was said, that I was over head and ears in debt
and hadn't a halfpenny left. I owned up it was
true. Well, he asked me if I'd like to go and be
his steward <i>pro tem</i>, till something else turns up.
It's uncommonly kind of the old fellow; but he

<!-- page 18 -->

always liked me. It'll be turning over a new
leaf with a vengeance, it seems to me, if I do all
his dirty work for him. But I don't quite see
what else to do, for I literally haven't the money
now to pay for my bed at the inn. And it would
suit me awfully well to lie quiet for a bit."</p>

<p>Rex had looked keenly at his brother from time
to time during this speech; but he made no reply
when it was over. He stood against the mantel-shelf, 
quietly smoking. Presently Oliver looked
up.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think, Rex?"</p>

<p>"Why, take it, of course."</p>

<p>Oliver rose and stretched himself. After a moment 
he spoke again.</p>

<p>"I wanted to act fair and square, old man;
that's why I came in to speak to you about it.
As far as I'm concerned of course I've no choice,
being penniless. Sir Charles makes it comfortable
for me; he is going to shut up the steward's house,
or let it; and I am to live at Hawthorndene. I
suppose you've no objection?"</p>

<p>"I!" exclaimed Rex.</p>

<!-- page 19 -->

<p>Oliver laughed. "That's all right," he said.
"But you must remember I am myself an admirer
of Miss Margery Hawthorn's, and have been your
rival. I did not know if you would care for me
to live in the same house with her."</p>

<p>"You are not my rival now," said Rex quietly.
"What objection could I possibly have? You and
Margery are very good friends?"</p>

<p>The inherent nobility of the man came out as he
said this; and never had the difference between
the brothers been so apparent as at this moment.</p>

<p>"Of course we are," said Oliver easily. "That's
all right, and I'll settle it at once. It's a queer
position, to go into harness next door, as it were."</p>

<p>"I wonder what the old man will think of it,"
said Rex. "If you stick to it, it may reconcile
him in time."</p>

<p>Oliver made no answer. At that moment old
Mr. Heriot's loud voice was heard in the stable-yard. 
Rex immediately went out to him; anything
to prevent his meeting Oliver and making the air
black by another scene.</p>

<p>Oliver waited, listening; he heard their voices

<!-- page 20 -->

growing fainter; then he went to the window and
looked after them. When they had vanished he
turned round to the fire with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, my brother!" he said aloud, "what a fool
you are!"</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 21 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER II.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margery Hawthorn</span> was sitting, ready dressed
for dinner, by the drawing-room fire that same
evening. She had ensconced herself in a low
rocking-chair, her favorite seat. She was a restless 
creature, unable to keep herself still for a
moment together; and the rocking-chair made a
sort of excuse for the continual vibration of her
whole frame. Margery was a great favorite, and
attracted everyone to her; there was something
in this constant activity of hers which was fascinating 
in itself. It was impossible to take your
eyes off her; the delicately pretty hands, with their
birdlike flutter, were a sufficient study in themselves 
to an observant person.</p>

<p>She was a true brunette, her hair and eyes both
of the intense blue-black one sees in the sky on
moonless nights; her face a pointed oval, dimpled

<!-- page 22 -->

with laughter, flashing with the keen intelligence of
the black eyes, fresh and beautiful with the clearness 
of the olive skin. An eager, clever, brilliant,
delightful young woman; with all kinds of burning
possibilities and potentialities not yet evolved.</p>

<p>As she sat here alone, swinging herself backwards 
and forwards, and tapping one foot impatiently 
on the ground, she whistled a little now
and again&mdash;just a bar of melody&mdash;and the whistle
was very soft and rich and pleasant. But it only
came with a more violent impulsion of the chair,
and seemed to betoken a passing crisis of restlessness 
or irritation of thought.</p>

<p>Through the door, which stood open, presently
entered, almost without sound, a lounging, handsome 
figure. It was that of Oliver Heriot.</p>

<p>"There's something ominous, to me, in the sound
of that whistle," he observed, in a low voice.
"I've noticed before that dire events follow the
exhibition of that accomplishment of yours, Miss
Margery. Pray, what has gone wrong?"</p>

<p>Margery laughed; a bright, infectious laugh.</p>

<p>"Why, what should have gone wrong?" she

<!-- page 23 -->

said. "You are absurd. But then you always are."</p>

<p>She turned away and took up an open book that
lay on a table beside her. Oliver very contentedly
sat down on a couch close by, and appeared to fall
into a profound reverie. Suddenly Margery threw
down her book and faced round on him.</p>

<p>"You are trying to make me think of something," 
she exclaimed. "I can feel you are! Oh,
do leave this horrid hypnotizing alone. I wish all
those ridiculous Psychic Research people were at
the bottom of the sea!"</p>

<p>Margery was an impetuous young woman, as
may be seen. She got up from her chair and began 
to walk restlessly up and down the room.</p>

<p>"It was Mrs. Carruthers who annoyed me," she
said suddenly; "that new American woman who
has come to live at the old Hall. I called on her
this afternoon. She is awfully pretty&mdash;the prettiest 
girl I have seen in my life. Now, I didn't
mean to say anything about her!" she exclaimed
in a different tone, stopping suddenly in her promenade. 
"Oliver Heriot, tell me the truth, have
you been making me tell you?"</p>

<!-- page 24 -->

<p>"I wanted to know what put you out," answered
Oliver languidly from his sofa.</p>

<p>"Oh, you wretch! This willing and wishing
is all very well as a game, but it's simply <i>hateful</i>
to have you go on like this at all sorts of times;
leave it alone, Oliver! It worries me. I had determined 
not to say anything about Mrs. Carruthers, 
and then I go and say just what I didn't
mean to say without even knowing I have said
it till afterwards! Why, it's maddening! Go
away, and leave me alone. You won't, of course&mdash;well, 
I'll go. Why doesn't papa come! It's
just dinner time. She is perfectly lovely, white-skinned, 
making one think of a lily, with masses
of chestnut hair and extraordinary great eyes that
seem to me to be red rather than brown, they are
so rich. And such little tapering hands. They
look so wicked! But <i>she</i> looks as innocent as a
baby. Anybody must love her, she's so pretty.
I'm certain she has met Rex somewhere, she is
very white, but she seemed to grow whiter when
she heard his name&mdash;and her eyes look so strange,
though she laughed the next minute. Oh! oh!"</p>

<!-- page 25 -->

<p>She stood perfectly still in the middle of the
drawing-room, shaking her pretty clenched fists
impotently in the air. She seemed consumed with
sudden rage. Then quickly controlling herself she
turned coldly to Oliver, who had risen to his feet
with a look of triumph lurking in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Oliver Heriot," she said, very earnestly,
"you know my father is the only friend you have
left in the world, at this moment. I swear, if you
go on using this horrible power of yours over me,
that I will speak to him at once, and make him
throw you over and forbid you the house. He
will do it, if I speak to him."</p>

<p>Oliver knew that was quite true, and he knew
that he could not afford to run any risks. He had
brought himself down to the financial level when a
comfortable dinner in a friend's house is a luxury
to be appreciated. And, moreover, he had a game
to play. It was but vaguely outlined as yet; but it
was there. He hesitated a moment in his reply to
Margery, only because he was not quite certain
how best to influence her. A few moments ago
he would simply have said&mdash;either aloud, or only

<!-- page 26 -->

in thought&mdash;"That's all very well, but you can't&mdash;you 
can't resist me, so don't try." But Margery
was just now very angry, all in arms, and in full
possession of her faculties. He could not exercise
any control over her while her mind was directed
against him, only when her attention wandered
away. He had found this out with the quickness
of a fairly good poker player. He therefore proceeded 
to distract her attention.</p>

<p>"Why, Margery," he said in a business-like,
straightforward voice, "it isn't like you to turn
frightened and waste your good gifts. You know
very well that if you would let me hypnotize you
properly and make you clairvoyant there wouldn't
be any secrets for you any longer. You would
know all about Mrs. Carruthers and everything
else you wanted to know. If you've got a sixth
sense why not use it?"</p>

<p>At this moment Sir Charles Hawthorn walked
into the room, and dinner was announced. The
three went across the wide fire-lit hall, to the
dining-room. Margery, having had no time to
make any answer, was thinking over what Oliver

<!-- page 27 -->

had said. It was hard for her to decide, in cold
blood; a longing for power and knowledge
rushed upon her. She combated it, and almost had
conquered, when the memory of Mrs. Carruthers'
pale exquisite face came back to her, and she saw
again the change of color that Reginald Heriot's
name had brought on it. Oh, how she loved
Rex! Could anyone ever come between them!
Hey heart throbbed and her vivid face flushed.
She raised her eyes and looked at Oliver. He
might be useful to her, yet! Oliver felt the look,
but did not answer it.</p>

<p>"Well, my boy," said Sir Charles as soon as
the servants had left the room, "have you decided
to take my offer?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Oliver, "I have, and am very
glad of it."</p>

<p>"And so am I;" echoed Sir Charles heartily.
"You're just the boy for me&mdash;lots of go in you&mdash;no 
funk. But you must turn over a new leaf,
my lad; that you must, if only to do me credit."</p>

<p>Margery said nothing, and was very silent
until she left the table. The chief reason why Sir

<!-- page 28 -->

Charles liked Oliver Heriot was that the younger
man understood <i>camaraderie</i> to perfection. He
knew just how to make himself agreeable to the
person he was with. It was an easy task for him
to please Sir Charles, who liked as a companion
a man who could tell a racy story, and listen to
one; and who was willing to sit for a couple of
hours over the dinner-table while his host drank
port. For Sir Charles was of the old school and
liked a sound wine and plenty of it. Oliver, who
was of a wonderfully easy-going nature in trifles,
could humor him in this way without getting
bored. He would sip his Burgundy, tell a story
now and then, and adroitly start Sir Charles upon
story-telling on his own account, all the while
thinking of something else. To-night he had
plenty to think of.</p>

<p>When at last they went upstairs they found
Margery in her rocking-chair by the fire, swinging
and apparently dreaming. She looked very happy
and content. A letter was crushed in her left
hand. It was from Reginald Heriot. He had
not ridden over to see her to-day, as was his custom

<!-- page 29 -->

every day; and so had sent a groom over with this
note. Evidently it was a very sweet one, to
have made Margery look so beautiful.</p>

<p>"I want to see Mrs. Carruthers," said Oliver,
coming to stand, man-like, between Margery and
the fire. "Won't you ask her here and give me
the chance?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course," said Margery, smiling blissfully. 
"We'll give a dinner party and ask everybody 
to meet her. All the world is longing to know
the American girl, who is said to be fabulously
rich and fabulously lovely. She certainly is lovely.
I wonder where she keeps her husband?"</p>

<p>"Why, in California, of course," said Oliver,
quite at a hazard.</p>

<p>He was surprised at the effect his words produced. 
Margery sat up straight and statue-like,
staring fixedly at him.</p>

<p>"She said something about California," she
murmured to herself&mdash;"I remember now. Mr.
Carruthers <i>is</i> there."</p>

<p>"Then no doubt she has met Rex when he was
out there," said Oliver cheerfully.</p>

<!-- page 30 -->

<p>Sir Charles, who was in excellent spirits that
evening, interrupted them at this point in the conversation, 
and tried to get Margery to sing for
him. But she was abstracted with her own
thoughts, and left Oliver to amuse him.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 31 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER III.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> very next morning Miss Margery Hawthorn 
wrote the invitations for her dinner party.
Of course the Heriots were invited. Margery
liked bringing things to a head, and getting to
close quarters with any little trouble that threatened 
her. She wanted to see, at once, what effect
Mrs. Carruthers would have upon Reginald. This
fair American was the most beautiful woman
Margery had ever seen, and she had a miserable
conviction that any man would inevitably prefer
her to her own dark self. How swarthy her face
seemed as she looked at it, thinking of Mrs. Carruthers' 
marvellous waxen pallor; how large her
strong, well-shaped hands appeared, contrasted
with Mrs. Carruthers'&mdash;so small that the brilliants
with which they were laden seemed altogether too
cumbrous. Margery was irritated by the sense of
this little creature's perfection, while at the same
time she was fascinated by it.</p>

<!-- page 32 -->

<p>Rex came over in the afternoon, as usual, and
the lovers had a happy hour alone in the drawing-room, 
Sir Charles and Oliver being out, riding
over the farm land. Margery told Rex about Mrs.
Carruthers, of whose arrival at the old Hall he
had of course already heard&mdash;for a rich American
creates some excitement in a quiet country place&mdash;and 
boldly eased her mind by asking him if he
had ever met her.</p>

<p>"I fancied she knew your name," said Margery
by way of explanation.</p>

<p>"I don't know <i>hers</i>," said Rex; "tell me, what
is she like?"</p>

<p>"Exquisitely beautiful," said Margery, "red-brown 
eyes, chestnut hair, a tiny waist&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't like small waists," interpolated Rex.</p>

<p>"Wonderful little hands, red lips, white
teeth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, come," said Rex, "hundreds of American
girls answer to this description. I don't suppose
I've ever seen her."</p>

<p>And in two minutes Mrs. Carruthers was entirely 
forgotten by both of them.</p>

<!-- page 33 -->

<p>When Oliver came into the drawing-room before 
dinner he saw at a glance that Margery was
well content with the world at large. He was
himself in a lazy and quiescent humor, having
really done a good deal of work under Sir Charles's
eye. So he made himself placidly agreeable, and
left Margery to dream her happy dreams undisturbed. 
That evening was one of the quiet and
pleasant ones so often spent in country houses;
music, and chat about nothings, and light laughter
filled up the short time between dinner and bed
time.</p>

<p>The next day was one of those which seem to
carry misery in the very air.</p>

<p>The first person who was cast into the depths
was Oliver Heriot. The morning letters brought
a dark gloom on his face which nothing lifted.
He tried to rouse himself for Sir Charles's amusement; 
but each effort was followed by a more profound 
reaction into dark thought and disgusted
reverie. In fact, his position, was an exceedingly
unpleasant one at the moment. Only those unfortunate 
people who have ever been in serious need

<!-- page 34 -->

of a large sum of money will quite appreciate this
young man's emotions. But these unfortunates
are so numerous that perhaps it is unnecessary to
enter into any further description at present.</p>

<p>He had nothing left to sell but his horses.
Those must go, of course. But they would only
bring in a fraction of what he needed. As he sat
at the table he now and again glanced across at
Margery; she was buried in a correspondence
which seemed to amuse her for she was laughing 
to herself. What a bright creature she
looked.</p>

<p>"The old man likes me better than he likes
Rex," said Oliver to himself. "He'd help me out
of this hole. And she's an heiress. Why can't I
make <i>her</i> like me better than Rex? And yet I
can't! Well, I suppose I have gone the wrong
way to work. With the influence I can get over
her in some things I ought to be able to succeed.
I must think it out."</p>

<p>He had to go over accounts and leases with Sir
Charles that morning; he got through pretty
creditably, and congratulated himself on being a

<!-- page 35 -->

very fair actor, when it was done; for he had
hardly understood anything. His stewardship
with Sir Charles was a mere temporary makeshift&mdash;it 
gave him somewhere to live in good quarters,
till he had hit on a new plan. But he could not
give his mind to it in earnest, when his own
affairs were worrying him. He had, however, long
since found out that much may be done by attending 
to appearances. The fact that he seemed to
listen intelligently was usually enough for Sir
Charles.</p>

<p>Margery went riding in the morning; but in
the afternoon stayed at home for Rex. Oliver had
idled an hour away by the morning-room fire after
lunch with her, and had told her what Rex had
said to him about going to California again to get
out of the quarrels at home.</p>

<p>"Has he said anything to you about it?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," answered Margery, much surprised.</p>

<p>"I asked him what you would say to it, and he
seemed rather wild with me for doing so."</p>

<!-- page 36 -->

<p>Margery told Rex of this when he came and
asked him what it meant.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," he said lightly. "That day I
did feel I couldn't bear the life any longer. But
the governor has not talked quite so much, since,
and I daresay I can stand it. I wouldn't go unless
you would go with me&mdash;and it's not the place
for a honeymoon, to my fancy."</p>

<p>The talk after this was not much worth recording. 
The afternoon, cold and keen outside, was
warm and flower-scented in the pleasant drawing-room 
of Hawthorndene; and these two sat by the
wood fire, letting the time slide by in that delightful 
oblivion that comes to us only when we are
with those we love. Margery was in her accustomed 
rocking-chair, and Rex was lounging in a
low deep chair by her side, when the door was
opened and a servant announced&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mrs. Carruthers."</p>

<p>Margery rose quickly, as she always moved like
a bird; but Rex drew himself slowly out of the
depths of his comfortable chair. Thus it was that
when Margery had greeted her visitor, Rex had

<!-- page 37 -->

only just turned to them, and Margery was free to
look from one to the other.</p>

<p>She caught a glance of intelligence pass between 
them, a look of recognition. It was so
perfectly clear to her that she expected Mrs.
Carruthers to put out her hand and claim Rex as
an old acquaintance. But no; she stood there,
a dream of loveliness, her fairness made the more
exquisite by the dark furs she wore, a smile on
her lips, her eyes innocent, inquiring, with the
most candid expression in their warm depths.
And Rex? Margery turned sharply to him. He
was looking down now, and stood passive and
quiet, wearing the correct expression of the unintroduced 
Englishman.</p>

<p>Margery recovered her <i>savoir faire</i> in a moment,
and introduced them. Rex bowed without looking 
up. Margery found herself, a moment
later, sitting rocking again, and talking away
with rather a feverish gayety and perhaps too easy
a manner, to Mrs. Carruthers. That lady was
quite self-possessed herself, but in a very different
way. She was one who never showed excitement

<!-- page 38 -->

or embarrassment; her widely opened eyes so
beautiful, with the large black pupils and red
lights round them, had always a surprised and
innocent air. She seldom lowered her gaze,
which was very direct, and her natural way of
talking was dilatory; she had nothing which
could be called an American accent, but she had
the peculiar intonation to a certain degree, and
the drawl greatly softened. But there was something 
about her speech which was quite her own&mdash;a 
certain breathlessness, as of suppressed excitement, 
as exhaustion after excitement. This little
mannerism she never lost, so that it was really
very difficult to tell when she was excited and
when she was not. Now, as she sat talking to
Margery, or, rather, answering her, in her pretty
hesitating way, she might have been suffering
acute embarrassment from Rex's presence; Margery, 
however, had observed her with sufficient
closeness already to know that she really showed
no sign of it.</p>

<p>Rex assumed the indolent, bored, indifferent
manner which he wore sometimes, and which rather

<!-- page 39 -->

became his handsome face than otherwise. Mrs.
Carruthers certainly did not seem to awaken any
interest in him. She excused herself for her
informal call by her cleverly expressed wish to
know more of Margery, whom she invited to lunch
with her on the morrow; she evidently proposed
to become an intimate and make a friend of her.
Margery accepted with enthusiasm. Mrs. Carruthers 
then asked Rex; but he excused himself.
Margery, watching like a lynx, saw Mrs. Carruthers 
throw a quick, inquiring glance at him, when
he refused; but he did not answer it. Afternoon
tea came in, and two other callers, and presently
Oliver; and in the atmosphere of gay talk and
laughter, Margery began to wonder whether she
had been fanciful&mdash;whether she had simply
imagined what had never happened. For Mrs.
Carruthers was as merry as possible, with a childlike 
gayety that won all hearts; and Rex grew
more like himself. Mrs. Carruthers was the first
visitor to go, and everyone seemed sorry to lose
her. She knew the art of taking leave just when
she had interested everyone. How she interested

<!-- page 40 -->

people it would be hard to say, for she had never
been known to say a clever or a witty thing. But
she was always a social success.</p>

<p>Oliver went out to the hall door with her. She
was driving a pair of very fine horses, and there
was quite a little fuss over handing her in, talking
about the horses, and seeing her start. The other
callers also said good-bye and came out on to the
steps, standing there to watch her go, before they
got into their own carriages. That was one of
Mrs. Carruthers' personal peculiarities; people
followed her about to look at her, not always
because they admired her, but rather because they
were in some way fascinated by her. Not everyone 
thought her pretty; but even those who did
not would stand to look at her, or walk a little way
to watch her pass.</p>

<p>Rex showed no inclination to follow her, however; 
he stood by the drawing-room fire, close to
Margery, but not speaking. He seemed lost in
some not very agreeable vein of thought. Margery
tried to read his thoughts in his face, but she could
not. No&mdash;his mind was a sealed book to her.</p>

<!-- page 41 -->

<p>"I know he is thinking of Mrs. Carruthers," she
said to herself; "but <i>what</i> is he thinking?" At
last in despair she broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Isn't she lovely?" she demanded. Rex did
not pretend not to understand.</p>

<p>"What, Mrs. Carruthers?" he said coolly, and
slowly. "She is the kind of woman that would be
called lovely by most people, but I don't think her
so. I don't think she's particularly good form,
either. She evidently means to make a friend of
you if she can manage it. Are you going to reciprocate?"</p>

<p>"What else can I do?" said Margery.</p>

<p>Rex shrugged his shoulders and said nothing.
Then, a moment later&mdash;just as Mrs. Carruthers'
phaeton drove past the window&mdash;he said good-bye,
and just as Oliver came into the room again, was
leaving it. Margery hardly answered him; she
stood motionless; he did not seem to notice her
manner but went straight out. Oliver turned back
and went with him to the door, talking about the
sending of his horses from Heriot House to London
to be sold. Rex promised to see them off; but so

<!-- page 42 -->

absent did he seem that Oliver repeated some
directions over to him a second time.</p>

<p>Margery stood just where she had been when
Rex said good-bye to her; she looked up and
watched him ride by. She was standing like that
when Oliver returned, her eyes still on the
window.</p>

<p>"Rex has gone very early," said Oliver; "I
can't imagine what has taken him home at this
time."</p>

<p>He approached Margery as he spoke and looked
fixedly at her. At first it seemed as if she would
not take any notice of him; but presently she
turned her head and her eyes met his. After a
moment she replied, in a dull voice,</p>

<p>"He passes the gate of the old Hall, as you very
well know. He is going to spend an hour with
Mrs. Carruthers on his way home."</p>

<p>"Did he tell you so?" asked Oliver with a
sneer.</p>

<p>She made no answer to this.</p>

<p>"So you're jealous?" he said.</p>

<p>She still made no answer. But Oliver had

<!-- page 43 -->

caught her eyes with his, as it were, and it seemed
as if she could not turn them away. She made a
desperate effort to resist his influence, and for
a long while remained stubbornly silent. But
suddenly her endurance gave way and she broke
out into a wild passion.</p>

<p>"I'd give worlds&mdash;worlds&mdash;to know what they've
been to each other&mdash;they've met before, I am
certain of it&mdash;though they tried to hide it from me&mdash;Oh, 
what would I not give to know if he's gone
to her now!"</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 44 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">"I expect</span> that would be easy enough if you'd
let me mesmerize you," said Oliver coolly.</p>

<p>She looked at him very earnestly. A battle
was raging in her heart. After a moment's pause
she passed him by and went away, out of the room
without a word.</p>

<p>"She'll ask me to-morrow," thought Oliver
with a smile on his face, "or if not to-morrow, the
very next time the Carruthers drives her wild
with jealousy. I'll back her to do it, if anyone
can; she's just the sort of woman. But Rex himself? 
I'm puzzled there. She's not the sort of
woman for him."</p>

<p>Margery went away by herself to try and think.
She was suffering acutely; torn hither and thither, 
and, for the first time in her life, experiencing
the agony of jealousy. There is no pain or torture 
like this, for it pervades the whole body; it
is physical pain, mental pain, emotional pain, all

<!-- page 45 -->

in one. Had Rex loved that little fair creature
and lost her? Did he love her still? Was he
with her now, listening to that peculiar, lingering
voice, looking into those marvellous eyes, so fascinatingly 
full of color and light and shade? If
so, what chance was there for her, Margery? She
must go away, hide herself, never see them again.&mdash;But 
what did she base all this on! A glance&mdash;a 
look! Oh, but that glance was conclusive. It
was no use, she herself had seen it. They were
old friends, these two, and understood each other.
And in the first instant of meeting they had helped
each other to deceive her&mdash;had acted for her benefit. 
She had never imagined Rex could deceive;
it had seemed so unlike him as to appear impossible. 
If he would do it in one thing he would do
it in others.</p>

<p>Then her mind went to Oliver&mdash;and to her own
curious faculties, discovered by the merest accident, 
during those drawing-room experiments
which they had amused themselves with. Sir
Charles had thought it immense fun for Margery
to be shut out of the room, and then, when she

<!-- page 46 -->

was admitted, for her to do any foolish thing
which he and Oliver had agreed upon. It amused
him, too, to find that neither he nor Oliver were
impressionable in this way. He was not given to
the unfortunate habit of thinking, and it never
occurred to him that there could be any further
development from these trivial amusements. He
would have been vastly surprised if he had been
told that it simply meant that Oliver Heriot could
put thoughts into his daughter's mind and make
her fancy them her own.</p>

<p>Margery, however, who was very shrewd, perfectly 
understood the situation, and to a certain
extent understood its dangers. But she did not
realize that they were already upon her; that
Oliver had now put the thought into her mind that
she should ask him to mesmerize her and make
her clairvoyant. The suggestion was working
now as she walked about her room. She was
intensely impatient of delay, and she was particularly 
daring and fearless. Cautious people
might have called her reckless.</p>

<p>She never thought of being afraid of Oliver's

<!-- page 47 -->

influence over her, or of the exercise of her own
faculties. Her only doubt was whether she ought
to use these to spy upon Rex. This doubt would
have finally held her back, it is certain, from making 
the experiment at all, but for the recollection,
which stung cruelly whenever it came into her
mind, of Rex's readiness to deceive her.</p>

<p>"I must know the truth!" she exclaimed at last,
speaking out loud in her excitement, and she
opened her door and hurried downstairs. Oliver
was still in the drawing-room alone, looking over
some papers he had drawn from his pocket-book, a
gloomy cloud on his forehead. He hastily put
them away when she entered.</p>

<p>"Come," she said, walking up to her favorite
rocking-chair, and sitting down in it, "try your
'prentice hand, Mr. Mesmerizer, and see if you can
make me see visions and dream dreams." She
spoke with an affectation of gayety which did not
deceive Oliver. He saw at once she was in
earnest.</p>

<p>"Do you mean it?" he said.</p>

<p>"Of course I do," she replied. "But remember

<!-- page 48 -->

I only want one thing&mdash;I want to see Rex, to see
where he is, and what he is doing. Be quick!
It's too late for any more callers and we shan't be
disturbed for half an hour."</p>

<p>She leaned back in her chair and looked at him.
Without any more words, Oliver came and stood
over her, and fixed his eyes on hers. In a very few
minutes her eyes turned upwards, showing the
white underneath between the half-closed lids, as
in very deep sleep. Oliver quietly made a few
passes over her head and face.</p>

<p>When he first discovered that he had this power
over her, he had amused himself by going to a
mesmerizing entertainment, in order to see how
the thing was done by professionals. But he
found, as he expected, that he scarcely needed to
make any exertion. She was an exceedingly good
subject, and she had of her own accord given up
her will to his. She was almost immediately in
a deep sleep. As soon as he felt assured this was
so, he began to speak to her.</p>

<p>"Try now and follow Rex," he said. "Tell me
if you can see him?"</p>

<!-- page 49 -->

<p>"I can see him galloping down the drive," she
said, in a voice which rather startled Oliver, for it
was not quite her own, "he is riding very fast. I
see, he is following a carriage; he has overtaken it.
The carriage stops; there is a very pretty lady in
it who speaks to him; but it is only for a moment&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can't you hear what they say?" asked Oliver.</p>

<p>She remained very still for a little while, then
she said, "Yes."</p>

<p>"Tell me what they say," commanded Oliver.</p>

<p>"He only said to her, 'When can I call, Mrs.
Carruthers?' and she answered, 'Not to-morrow,
I suppose?' and he said, 'Yes, I should like to
come in the morning, if you will excuse my being
so informal.' 'Very well,' she replies, 'about
eleven!' Oh, I understand! It is because Margery
will be there later! oh how Margery will
suffer over this!"</p>

<p>Her face altered from the expressionlessness of
sleep or deep trance, to an expression of acute
distress. Tears forced themselves between her
half closed lids and rolled, unheeded, down her

<!-- page 50 -->

cheeks. Oliver was so completely surprised at
her way of speaking that for a moment or two he
stood silently gazing at her. Then at last he
roused himself, remembering that she would probably 
not speak again unless he questioned her.</p>

<p>"Why do you talk of Margery as some one
else?" he said. "You are Margery."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "No," she answered,
"Margery is the other. I am sorry, very sorry for
her, she is suffering so much."</p>

<p>Sir Charles's voice was to be heard in the hall
at this moment; he was coming towards the drawing-room. 
Oliver, who felt he was in deep waters
that he did not himself yet understand, did not at
all wish Sir Charles to share in the situation. He
hastily exclaimed: "Wake!&mdash;Wake!" and made
some upward passes, such as he had seen mesmerists 
use in rousing their subjects. Almost immediately 
Margery opened her eyes; and when Sir
Charles entered the room there was nothing unusual 
to attract his attention, except that the fire
wanted stirring. He was one of those cheery
people who like a blaze, so he immediately started

<!-- page 51 -->

with vigor upon the coals, soon making a leaping
pyramid of flame which lit up all the room, grown
dim with the twilight. He was full of some
grievance about the stables and a new groom, and
plunged at once into the history, relating it to
Oliver with much spirit and noise. Suddenly he
stopped short and then ejaculated&mdash;"God bless
my soul! Margery, my dear, my child, what's the
matter?"</p>

<p>Oliver turned and looked at her. She was leaning 
forward in her chair, rocking herself to and
fro like one in mortal pain. Tears fell fast, unnoticed, 
from her eyes. When her father spoke to
her she burst out sobbing; then checking herself
by a violent effort she got up and fled from the
room.</p>

<p>Lost in amazement Sir Charles turned round
upon Oliver.</p>

<p>"What's wrong!" he exclaimed. "Do <i>you</i>
know anything about it, sir?"</p>

<p>"Not I," answered Oliver instantly, "I can't
imagine what's happened."</p>

<p>"Then it's that brother of yours. A lover's

<!-- page 52 -->

quarrel, I suppose. I won't have my child made
unhappy! I never saw her cry in all her life before.
I'll forbid him the house if he makes her cry. I'll
go and see if she will speak to me."</p>

<p>He followed Margery, leaving Oliver to the not
very agreeable society of his own extremely confused 
and bewildered thoughts. He relieved his
feelings as soon as he was alone, by a prolonged
whistle; a form of melody which has a surprisingly 
soothing effect on most men at critical moments. 
Then he sat down and proceeded to
think.</p>

<p>After a few moments of profound thought he
got up hurriedly and went to the library of the
house&mdash;a dark little room at the back, for Sir
Charles was no reader, and saw no use in giving
up a room to books he never opened; but, nevertheless, 
lined with volumes on the walls, and
crowded with them on the tables, for Margery was
a great reader on all sorts of subjects. Oliver
went to a certain obscure corner where, on a shelf,
all together, stood a number of green paper-bound
books. He searched among them till he found

<!-- page 53 -->

the one he wanted, and then sat down to read it
with close attention. It was a volume of Psychic
Research reports, and the page he opened it at
was on "French Experiments on Strata of Personality."</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 54 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER V.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> had not been able to read more than a few
pages when he was interrupted by Sir Charles,
who came in very disconsolately, evidently in
need of someone to speak to. He never liked
being alone, and particularly disliked it when
anything worried him or put him out. So he came
straight to Oliver with his troubles, like a grown-up 
child.</p>

<p>"She is in such a state of distress she really
cannot explain herself," he said; "but it's evidently 
something wrong about Rex. It seems to
me that she has got a fit of jealousy. But who of
and why? What is it all about? Do you really
know nothing about the matter?"</p>

<p>Oliver shook his head, meantime turning over the
pages of the book in his hand, in search of ideas upon
the subject that absorbed him. Suddenly, it seemed
to him he had hit upon the explanation of Margery's 

<!-- page 55 -->

present exceedingly distressed state. He
had intensified the idea already in her mind;
possibly, if he had chosen he could have left her,
on awaking, quite oblivious of what she had seen
in her state of morbid consciousness. Instead of
that he, acting unscientifically, and thinking about
it himself, had left it burned into her mind.</p>

<p>"It really seems as if it depends on me now,
whether she is to be jealous of Rex or not," he
thought; "upon my word that opens a queer vista
of possibilities. I think I'll go out and see if
that sick mare has had her mash "&mdash;this last he
said aloud, prompted by a keen desire to escape
from Sir Charles's presence.</p>

<p>"I wonder if it would be right!" he thought.
"I wonder if it is all some devil's work?" As
this struck him he stood still and stared up at the
starlit sky. He had got out of the house and
was standing on the broad gravel terrace in front
of it. One large window upstairs was brightly
lit up. It was the window of Margery's room.
He looked from the stars to the light of her lamp,
and back again. But no direct inspiration or

<!-- page 56 -->

guidance came to him either way. He was left to
puzzle the matter out for himself, and attend to
his own casuistry.</p>

<p>Oliver Heriot's was one of those complex
natures which find life full of pleasure, but also
full of pain and difficulty. He would give a great
deal of thought as to his course of action under
given circumstances, and yet, after all, act entirely
upon impulse. His love of pleasure and excitement 
was intense, and when roused was completely
master of him; desire pulled him hither and
thither, and made a mere puppet of him. His conduct 
was too often that of the ordinary rake and
profligate, apparently unaffected by any considerations 
of heart or conscience. But this was not
by any means his real character; after the event
he would be smitten with remorse, and indeed before 
it. His mind was sufficiently intelligent to
show him beforehand, only too plainly for his own
peace of mind, that what he was about to do was
not right and would distress his conscience afterwards. 
What he lacked was the resolution to
obey either heart or conscience when the moment

<!-- page 57 -->

of temptation came. Against his better knowledge
he committed his follies and faults.</p>

<p>But Oliver had more than the sense of right and
wrong, which indeed most of us possess in a more
or less positive form. He had the religious mind,
and he experienced not only remorse but fear. He
believed that from those starlit skies an eye watched
him and observed his doings, and, in due time,
would punish him for such of them as were wrong.
He had none of the consolations of the modern
unbeliever who walks daringly into the dark abyss
of the future, fearless of it because convinced that
there is nothing there either to fear or to hope for.
Such a condition was unimaginable to him. When
he did wrong he did it like a child who trembles
with the knowledge of a safe and certain rod in
pickle. To a man of this mode of thought, or
perhaps it would be more correct to say of feeling,
it is only natural that the mysterious powers we
call hypnotism and mesmerism should not appear
as forces of supernature, lending themselves to
scientific research, but as the gifts either of God
or of the devil. It seemed to him, as it would

<!-- page 58 -->

seem to most of us, that there was really something
rather satanic about this power of his which he
could exercise over Margery. For the time being
he used her will, not she.</p>

<p>Realizing it almost in these words, as he suddenly 
did, brought a strange thrill upon him.
Using her will!&mdash;that described his power very
well. He could use it. To what end should he
use it? How could Margery benefit him? He
was not at all in love with her; not in the least&mdash;otherwise 
the question would have been a very
easy one to answer. But, impressionable as Oliver
was in many ways, he had never suffered love, and
did not know what it meant. He knew what
pleasure was, though, very well; and knew that
unless some kind streak of fate brought relief to
him, pleasure would be his no more, for a very
long time to come.</p>

<p>The mare had had her warm mash a good hour
before Oliver visited her. He did so at last, for
the sake of appearances, after a good brisk walk in
the shrubberies; then he went back to the house

<!-- page 59 -->

for the inevitable brandy-and-soda and cigar with
Sir Charles before bed.</p>

<p>Sir Charles was very much out of sorts that
evening, for he was devoted to Margery, and when
anything went wrong with her it altered everything
for him. Oliver found it an uncommonly dull
s&eacute;ance, and sincerely wished himself in London or
Paris, where a cab would quickly bring him into
the haunts of what he called civilization. To be
amused was his prime need; and he was at present
in such a very tight place in his affairs that he
could not even present himself in those agreeable
places where amusement was to be found. Something 
must be done!&mdash;but what?</p>

<p>Yesterday he had not an idea. Now he thought
obscurely of Margery, what might she not do for
him! He went to bed and determined to sleep on
his chaotic thoughts, in the hope of forming some
clearer plan for the morrow.</p>

<p>The breakfast-table at Hawthorndene was generally 
very gay. Sir Charles in the most boisterous
spirits, and Margery, with that fresh morning face
and mien which are one of the great beauties of

<!-- page 60 -->

the young and healthy. But on this next morning 
the meal had none of its usual brightness.
Margery was quiet, but very pale and evidently
very nervous. Sir Charles simply followed her
humor, and kept watching her as a dog watches
his master when he thinks there is something
wrong and cannot guess what it is. Oliver was
disgusted to find he was no nearer a solution of his
problem than overnight, and his anxieties would
give him no rest. It is quite surprising how acute
pecuniary difficulties sharpen the wits and keep
the brains at work. A man who is a comparative
dullard one day, discovers a hitherto hidden talent
the next. But even more surprising is the way in
which an intolerable need of money alters the
moral sense. Oliver found himself quietly considering 
what Margery possessed that would be
worth his having. Her check-book did not present
sufficient temptation; although she was an heiress,
she now only commanded a fairly good allowance.
Herself&mdash;well, yes, she was worth having, and he
meant to make a very steady try for that. But
that might take time&mdash;almost certainly would.

<!-- page 61 -->

And an alleviation for the moment was what he
wanted.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning he would never have supposed 
he could coolly weigh these things in his
mind and speak so plainly to himself. But then
he had had his fits of remorse overnight, beforehand, 
under the stars. It was broad daylight now,
and money or the want of it seemed more real than
right or wrong.</p>

<p>Margery only gave him a very cold good-morning, 
did not speak to him afterwards, and scarcely
lifted her eyelids. Was she afraid of him? or was
she angry with him? Well, he concluded, it mattered 
very little. If he used his power resolutely
he could alter her mood as he chose. Could this
be so? he asked himself, in fits of doubt. Was it
possible that one human being could have so much
influence over another? and that other such a determined 
person as Margery Hawthorn? for undeniably 
that young lady had twice his own resolution.
Glancing up at her pale, set face in the strong
morning sunshine, he thought to himself over and
over again that he must be wrong in his memory,&mdash;that 

<!-- page 62 -->

she could never have been influenced by him as
she had been. This was not the plastic, weak-willed 
creature which popular imagination pictures
the easily mesmerized subject.</p>

<p>Oliver knew nothing of the deeper and more
unintelligible part of the mystery, although it was
even now taking place before his eyes. Margery
herself knew nothing of it, though she herself was
actually conducting it. As she sat at the table,
listless preoccupied, she was all the while literally
hypnotizing herself and placing herself under
Oliver's dominance. She tried to put the whole
thing out of her mind, but it was impossible to do
so, for her intense love for Rex and her desperate
jealousy of him, conquered her more reasonable
thoughts. The eyes of her mind were fixed on
Rex so steadily that she was unable to bring any
other subject within view. We must all have
experienced the peculiar effect, when one is greatly
troubled about some particular thing or person, of
being really unable to think of anything else. The
attempt is only a pretence; and we find the old
image back again in less than an instant of time

<!-- page 63 -->

because it has never been displaced at all. So it
was with Margery this morning. She had but one
vision&mdash;Rex in Mrs. Carruthers' drawing-room;
but one thought&mdash;what has he to say to her? Her
intense longing to answer this last question, and
her complete belief that Oliver could enable her to
do so, practically placed her in his hands without
his having to make any effort, if he could but have
understood this. But he did not, nor did he imagine 
that but for this absorbed and prepared state
of her own mind he would have had no such tremendous 
power over her as he soon found to be in
his hands. He imagined all the mystery to be in
himself, and trembled, when he thought of it, as to
whence his gift came. This confusion between
cause and effect is very common in matters of every
day&mdash;still more so in these matters which we do
not fully understand. It is so natural to fancy all
the power and the mystery lie in oneself!</p>

<p>Oliver's sense of this filled him with an exciting
feeling of responsibility. He was a born gambler
and he felt as if he had learned a new game and
was not quite certain yet of his own skill in

<!-- page 64 -->

playing it. What card should he put down next?
He could not determine.</p>

<p>But, as so very often happens for us in life, his
card was played for him.</p>

<p>They were always late people at breakfast, and
to-day they sat later than usual. The whole reason
was in Margery, who had been behind her time
at the table and did not seem disposed to leave it.
The others, for very different reasons, hung about,
watching her. At last Sir Charles lit a cigar and
went off to the stables. He took Oliver with him
perforce. Oliver had intended to remain with
Margery and speak to her, but could find no excuse. 
In a very preoccupied manner he followed
Sir Charles, and joined as well as he could in the
stable-talk.</p>

<p>Presently he caught sight of a figure which attracted 
his attention; a slight, darkly-clad figure,
leaning on the gate between the stable-yard and
the flower garden. It was Margery. She was
looking towards him. He immediately threw away
the cigar he was smoking and went to her, determined 
to trust to the inspiration of the moment for

<!-- page 65 -->

what he should do and say. Her face was quite
drawn and white from mental distress. She had
put on a straw garden hat, and drawn a dark shawl
over her shoulders. She looked prettier than ever
with this new pathetic, anxious look upon her
usually gay face.</p>

<p>"Don't you know," she said in the dull, constrained 
voice which he had heard her use before
under strong excitement, "don't you know it's
past eleven! I can't help it, Oliver&mdash;I can't help
it! I never meant to speak to you of this again&mdash;but, 
oh, when the time comes and I know he is
with her I can't bear it&mdash;I can't bear it!"</p>

<p>"You've no reason to be so distressed as this,"
said Oliver; "you don't know that you have any
cause to be jealous!"</p>

<p>She suddenly broke into sobs, and the gate she
leaned against shook with the violence of her
passion.</p>

<p>"It is no use to talk to me!" she exclaimed
wildly, "I am ashamed of myself that I have let
you see all my misery so plainly, and that you
should know about it! But I cannot help it!

<!-- page 66 -->

'Tis no use. And I must know&mdash;I must know
the truth. Do what you did yesterday, Oliver, so
that I can hear what they are saying to each other!
It is like playing the spy&mdash;I know it&mdash;I am
ashamed of it&mdash;but I can't help it. Come!"</p>

<p>She opened the gate herself for him to pass
through. His conscience pricked him. The
thing was so easy, so given into his hands, that
he, in his turn, was ashamed.</p>

<p>"I don't know if it's right, Margery," he said
in a hesitating voice.</p>

<p>"I don't care if it's right or wrong," she blazed
out in sudden violence. "I have made up my
mind to know the truth. I cannot bear this suspense 
and anxiety any longer. Why should I?
I have a right to know the truth!"</p>

<p>This was the one idea in her mind at the moment 
and it seemed quite useless to try to bring
any other aspect of the affair before her. She
turned and walked hurriedly down one of the
garden paths and Oliver followed her more slowly.</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Carruthers</span> was one of those rare
flowers of womanhood that are produced in perfection 
in southern America; essentially exotic in
every characteristic. She was delicate and fragile
to the last degree, yet full of a subtle vitality
which was almost like hardiness. She did not
like rising early, and found it hard to present herself, 
in the English manner, fully dressed in the
forenoon. But when she did this, she did it to
perfection; there was no dull languor in her face
as with a sickly Englishwoman. She was fresh as
a white hot-house rose, the pallor of her face having 
a perfectly healthy appearance&mdash;whether the
result of art or nature none could tell, and who
cared?&mdash;there was nothing to show delicacy but
the deep blue-green circles under her eyes which
might have been the work of art, so deep were
they&mdash;but these certainly were not.</p>

<p>Just like this, an exquisite smile on her soft

<!-- page 68 -->

mouth, bringing into play two dainty dimples,
and a roguish gleam of fun in her eyes&mdash;a picture
of happy beauty&mdash;was Amy Carruthers, as she sat
in the dark morning-room in the old Hall when
Rex Heriot was shown in.</p>

<p>"How beautiful you look," he said, immediately, 
and without thought, as one might have said
it to a child.</p>

<p>"I am glad you think so!" she answered, with
her merry laugh, which only appeared mechanical,
like a canary's roulade, after one had heard it a
good many times, and with the glance from her
great eyes which she had never yet found any
man resist.</p>

<p>"It's no matter of thinking," he replied. "It's
so patent a fact. You are a marvel&mdash;you have
done wonderfully!" he went on, a tone of honest
admiration in his voice.</p>

<p>"I had no idea of meeting you in England,"
said Mrs. Carruthers, with the simple, graceful
manner of a lady addressing an old acquaintance.
"I was very much surprised to find you really a
neighbor."</p>

<!-- page 69 -->

<p>"I suppose so" said Rex rather dryly. Then,
with a certain abruptness he went on, "What are
you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Going to do?" she echoed.</p>

<p>"Are you going into society?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course. Why not?"</p>

<p>"Why not, indeed! You'll be an acquisition
here, where society is usually as slow as a Sunday
school. But who have you with you? Where's
Carruthers?"</p>

<p>"In New York. He's coming over."</p>

<p>"And who <i>is</i> Carruthers?" There was a faint
insolence in this question or rather in the way
in which it was asked, which would very much
have surprised Margery. It would scarcely have
seemed to her to be Rex who was speaking. But
it was, and though the thinly-disguised rudeness
gave his face a disagreeable look, it lent a curious
handsomeness to it at the same time. Mrs. Carruthers 
darted a very dangerous glance at him; a
glance in which she seemed to be taking his
measure and questioning his intent. She answered 

<!-- page 70 -->

with a perfect nonchalance, and as if in
reply to the most friendly speech.</p>

<p>"Oh, you know him quite well; you met him
in California."</p>

<p>"What! Carruthers, the millionaire? You don't
mean it?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Such a gentlemanly fellow&mdash;neat as a new
pin&mdash;&mdash;" Suddenly a dark flush rose in Rex's face.
"I beg your pardon!" he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't," said Amy Carruthers, with
the sweetest of smiles. "I know my husband is
awfully particular&mdash;but&mdash;I satisfy him. Isn't that
enough? "</p>

<p>"I should say so. How did you come to meet
him?"</p>

<p>"Does all that interest you? Surely not! Mr.
Heriot, isn't it a good plan to live for the present
moment? Isn't it a rather philosophical idea? I'm
very stupid, I know, but I fancy somebody very
clever recommended that."</p>

<p>"You're quite right, Mrs. Carruthers," said Rex,
looking down with evident embarrassment, "and

<!-- page 71 -->

I assure you I'm the last man in the world to
wish to destroy the pleasantness of the present
moment. You're quite safe in that, so far as I'm
concerned. But I want you to do just one little
thing for me."</p>

<p>"And what is that? You know I'm one of the
most good-tempered people in the world, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! I know you are; really that's one
of your most delightful qualities. Well! you've
heard, I suppose, even in the short time you have
been here, that I am engaged to Miss Hawthorn."</p>

<p>"Of course; and it shows your good taste!"</p>

<p>"You like her?"</p>

<p>"Indeed yes."</p>

<p>"That is not what I mean. Do you like her,
or do you think she will be useful to you? Come,
tell me the truth! "</p>

<p>Oh, how foolish a man is when he tries to force
the hand of such a woman as this!</p>

<p>"I like and admire her immensely, and I own I
think she will be useful to me, for everyone seems
fond of her, and of course I want to find good

<!-- page 72 -->

friends&mdash;kind friends, charitable hearts; I am
sure she is good, kind, and charitable. English
people are not all this, as a rule, and I am
frightened amongst them&mdash;with all of them but
her!"</p>

<p>It was said with the most exquisitely pitiful
air. Rex, looking at her lovely face, accepted all
she said. It never occurred to him that it was not
society, but himself, whom she desired to disarm
through Margery; that the instant she had heard
she was engaged to him she had resolved to win
the girl's heart as quickly as possible. Instead of
letting him suspect this she at once seized upon
his own good nature. A gentler expression came
upon his face, for her perfect manner appealed to
him, and he felt sorry for her.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he said, "Margery is good-hearted.
What I wanted to say sounds almost too brutal."</p>

<p>"Say it!" As she spoke she rose and moved
to the window, and then turned abruptly and
came towards him. Her figure was shown to
perfection in the soft morning robe she wore,
and no man living could have looked at her without 

<!-- page 73 -->

admiration as she moved in the sunlight.
Her face was very sad and her great dark eyes
were full of tears. She paused a little way from
him, and fixed these softened eyes on his.</p>

<p>"Say it! It doesn't matter if it's brutal. I've
been used to brutality&mdash;in the past."</p>

<p>"Don't speak like that! It's unbearable!"</p>

<p>His thought, as he watched her, was, "How
much of all this does she mean? But a fellow
can't be hard on such a soft little thing."</p>

<p>Hers was&mdash;"How long will it take to make
him fall in love with me?"</p>

<p>She laughed, lightly enough, and sat down
again in her chair. "Please don't hesitate any
longer&mdash;I hate delay!"</p>

<p>"Oh, well!" he answered, rather shamefacedly,
"it's only this&mdash;I wish you wouldn't make a
special friend of Miss Hawthorn. There&mdash;I've
got it out."</p>

<p>She lowered her eyes, and seemed plunged in
profound thought. It lasted but a minute or two.</p>

<p>"I'll do just as you wish!" she said earnestly.
"I'll make her dislike me if I can. But whether

<!-- page 74 -->

or no, I swear to you she'll never regret having
known me."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Rex with an air of
honest relief, for her serious tone convinced him
of her genuineness. "I'm sure you'll keep your
word."</p>

<p>"Why, of course," she said, with an exquisitely
pathetic gesture. "Am I not entirely at your
mercy?"</p>

<p>Rex, like an Englishman, answered her rather
roughly. "Nonsense!" he exclaimed. "As if I
would injure a woman!"</p>

<p>She looked up at him&mdash;only for a second, a
quick, shrewd glance&mdash;and then looked down
again as she spoke.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I know you would not do that&mdash;you 
are a gentleman. But you won't prejudice
Miss Hawthorn against me, will you?&mdash;Of course,
I don't mean openly, but by ever so little a
slight? For I will keep my word; and I cannot
tell you what a priceless boon it is to me to speak
to such a true lady as she is. You know, Mr.
Heriot, we don't get stamped for life&mdash;at least, I

<!-- page 75 -->

hope not. You, for instance, you don't find you
must kill a man every day, do you?"</p>

<p>Rex started as if he had been shot, and turned
white to the lips. But he said nothing; only
looked at her. She met his gaze and smiled.</p>

<p>"We all of us find it convenient at times," she
said very softly, "to forget both what has happened 
to ourselves and to others in the past. Isn't
it so? Will you stay to lunch? And then you
need not feel any anxiety about Miss Hawthorn&mdash;for 
to-day at least."</p>

<p>"Thanks&mdash;no&mdash;I don't think I can," said Rex.
"You see, she&mdash;well, she wouldn't know how I
came to be here in the morning. No, I think I'd
better not. Thank you all the same. I'll trust her
to you. Good-bye&mdash;I must be going, or else I shall
meet her at the door, which would be rather more
foolish than if I stayed."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, so it would," said Mrs. Carruthers,
with her bird laugh, throwing off all her pathetic
manner in a moment. "Well, if you must go,
go; but come again very soon. Why not come
in the afternoon? No one will be any the wiser.

<!-- page 76 -->

Do! We shall be a party of ladies unless some
callers take pity on us. Did I tell you Miss Carruthers 
is here? She is awfully dull. There's no
society at all in England, according to her; but
then of course she hasn't seen much yet. You'll
like her if you like a downright American girl."</p>

<p>"If I can manage it I will come in the afternoon," 
said Rex; and so took his departure.</p>

<p>He had not been gone ten minutes&mdash;during
which interval Mrs. Carruthers had remained quite
still, in a profound reverie&mdash;when Margery Hawthorn, 
was announced, and entered the room. She
came in very nervously, and looked round with a
quick, apprehensive glance. Apparently she was
disappointed in something. With an evident
effort she controlled herself, and replied to Mrs.
Carruthers' greeting.</p>

<p>"I believe I am very early," she said. "It is
such a lovely morning I could not stay indoors."</p>

<p>"Don't apologize!" exclaimed Mrs. Carruthers,
with her beautiful smile. "You know how glad I
am to see you. It is so good of you to come in
this informal way. It is the sort of kindness that

<!-- page 77 -->

a stranger like myself appreciates to the full.
I can't tell you how happy it makes me feel. It's
lonely here at first, you know, without my husband.
I hope he'll be over very soon, though. Sit down
here by the fire and get warm. I am going to
give you a glass of wine, for you are as white as a
sheet."</p>

<p>It was quite true. Margery was not herself;
her rich color had left her, her bright face was
drawn and haggard. She scarcely seemed able to
speak. The necessity for some kind of speech
opened her lips at last.</p>

<p>"I believe I am not very well," she said.
"Yes, I will have some wine. I think it must be
the cold."</p>

<p>And all the while she was looking round the
room with the same anxious, eager look that had
been on her face from the first moment when she
entered.</p>

<p>She was so convinced that Rex was in the room
that she still looked round it for him. His figure
was so clearly photographed before her mind's
eye, standing here amid these surroundings&mdash;which

<!-- page 78 -->

till this moment she had never seen in reality
before&mdash;that it seemed as if her failure to see him
now must be an optical delusion. Where was he?
With a mighty effort she controlled herself, when
the question was actually on her tongue.</p>

<p>Amy Carruthers was quite shrewd enough to be
perfectly aware that Margery's distress was mental,
and had nothing to do with cold, or any other
physical circumstance. But she was completely
at a loss as to what it could be due to, having no
clew of any sort. Like Sir Charles, she imagined
it must be the result of a lovers' quarrel, but she
was puzzled at having seen no signs of this in Rex
himself. She flattered herself he would never have
been able to conceal it from her.</p>

<p>She brought Margery a glass of port wine herself,
and watched her drink it, talking the while about
the cold, and the necessity for taking care of
oneself. The wine and the fire together did bring
back a certain amount of color to Margery's face,
and she began to look a little more natural. For
physical comfort or discomfort tells more strongly
on people when suffering emotionally than under

<!-- page 79 -->

any other conditions. And Margery had reached
that extreme point of mental misery and anxiety
which is really a state of exhaustion; even a faint
ray of physical warmth and comfort cheered
and restored her a little. The effect simply was
to make her remember that this woman who was
apparently so kind to her, was in reality her arch-enemy&mdash;her 
rival&mdash;a much worse word! Her
rival, yes, and perhaps even more, a safe and
assured one, while she herself, Margery, who had
given her whole innocent, untried heart to Rex,
was to suffer these tortures of uncertainty and
doubt.</p>

<p>They were both completely in the dark, and
could only watch and wait.</p>

<p>Both being possessed of great mechanical ease of
manner, a fairly good presentment of conversation
was carried on about mere trifles until, to the great
relief of both, a distraction was caused by Miss
Carruthers coming into the room.</p>

<p>Margery had never formed a serious attachment
to any woman in her life as yet; but her heart
went out to Hetty Carruthers the moment she saw

<!-- page 80 -->

her. The interest aroused was mutual; and sprang
into an affection which never altered, but served as
a support and compact through all the troubles
that lay before these two. The candid and honest
hearts, the fresh and unsophisticated natures,
recognized and trusted each other on the instant.</p>

<p>The two feelings immediately roused by Hetty
Carruthers' entrance into any English drawing-room 
were, first, profound admiration, and afterwards 
immense amusement. She was just what
Mrs. Carruthers had said, a true American girl;
but of the most marked type and the most attractive
order. Her beauty was extraordinary, in its own
way. If Mrs. Carruthers was like a hot-house
flower this girl was like a field rose. Her perfectly
shaped face had always a vivid flush on it that
looked as if she had just been burnt by the sun or
the fire; her blue eyes were like drops of water
with the sun shining on them; her head was
crowned by a quantity of rather rough bronze hair
that was too thick ever to be forced into the fashion,
but which escaped from its pins and fell in loose
untidiness. And her figure!&mdash;thin to a fault,

<!-- page 81 -->

quite undeveloped, but splendidly shaped, and so
supple she could throw herself about like a Moorish
dancing girl&mdash;and indeed, found it hard to keep
her movements sufficiently conventional.</p>

<p>Carruthers the millionaire was one of mushroom
growth, and his sister had spent all her life hitherto
in climbing apple trees, riding half-wild ponies
bare-backed, cooking, and making butter&mdash;in all
the work and play of a country farm. He had
brought her away from home now to acquire the
polish which had long since been rubbed into himself. 
At present an amused look came on every
face the moment this beautiful creature opened her
mouth; and Amy Carruthers was continually requesting 
her to keep it shut as much as possible.
The consequence was Hetty felt like a child at
school, and longed for someone to whom she could
speak freely and pour out all her heart.</p>

<p>In five minutes she had made Margery feel
almost like herself again, for she had made her
laugh; and the mere fact of laughing will, for the
moment, throw off the deepest despair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carruthers left them alone a little while;

<!-- page 82 -->

she was not particularly anxious as to what Hetty
said to Margery, and did not feel it necessary to
stay on guard as she would have done had there
been a man or a severely critical matron present.</p>

<p>"You look awful nice," said Hetty drawing her
chair up to the fire and looking at Margery intently.
"I declare I ain't seen anyone look as nice and
straight as you do since I came to this country.
Say, now Amy's away a minute, do tell&mdash;you live
here, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Margery; "quite near."</p>

<p>"What, all the time? Well, look here, I don't
see how you hold on if there ain't any nice fellers
round. Oh, but I forgot, Amy says you don't call
'em fellers over here. Is that so? You don't?
Well, then what do you call 'em, anyway? Men?
Yes? Well, I s'pose I'll learn in time. But 'tain't
easy. Well, don't they grow in this country? I
ain't seen one since I came over. Ain't there any
real nice ones, that takes the girls round and gives
'em parties? I don't seem to understand things
over here. Why, I'm only a girl, and never been
anywhere, but I've lots of fellers home&mdash;they're

<!-- page 83 -->

always carrying on with some fun or other. I
don't seem to understand being so awful dull as
we are here. We don't ever have a real good time
at all, and I don't b'lieve we're ever <i>going</i> to. It's
always dressing and sitting up, just like prayer
meeting. Say, is it like that <i>all</i> the time over
here? I only wish Joseph had left me at home&mdash;<i>I</i>
don't want to see Europe&mdash;I don't think the whole
show's worth a cent. I only wish I was back home.
But there, it does seem awful nice to see anyone
laugh nat'ral, like you do. You'll have to be good
to me and tell me what I'm to say to the fellers,
for I declare Amy's made me that scared I daren't
hardly open my mouth. Well, I declare there's
the lunch bell, and I <i>am</i> glad&mdash;I'm just as starved
as anybody can be and live. I do believe it's being
so awful moped makes me so hungry. I hope you
eat, so I won't be ashamed, for Amy only pecks up
little bits. Nobody could live on what she eats,
and I believe she has lots up in her dressing-room.
'Tain't manners, I guess, to eat when folks is
'round."</p>

<p>One great advantage about Hetty Carruthers'

<!-- page 84 -->

style of conversation was that she never wanted
any answer. She took her cue from the expression
of the person she was talking to, and went on with
her monologue.</p>

<p>With the sound of the church bell came Mrs.
Carruthers; and with her entrance came the wave
of despair and doubt again upon Margery's spirit,
which Hetty's bright presence had momentarily
lifted.</p>

<p>These three lunched alone, sitting in a little
group at the end of a great oval dining-table
loaded with silver, and waited on by most gorgeous 
footmen. The establishment was on a very
splendid scale. Before the Carruthers took it, the
Hall had been a rather dark and dreary example
of a historic county show-house. They had filled
in the substantial framework with all kinds of
grandeur and glitter which it amused Margery to
observe. The mingled effect seemed to her odd,
and yet it was attractive. Some of the rooms
they had entirely re-furnished, as, for instance,
the morning-room. It was no wonder when
Margery came in that she grew pale, even if

<!-- page 85 -->

anxiety had not caused her to do so. For in her
hypnotic vision she had seen Rex standing there
by the plush-covered gilt-dressed chair from which
he had risen, with a gold and white harp-shaped
screen behind him. These were the first objects
her eyes fell upon, and it startled her, for when
she had called on Mrs. Carruthers she had been
received in the drawing-room, and she knew nothing 
about the morning-room or how it was furnished. 
The circumstance gave her a strangely
eerie and unnatural feeling. From this eerieness,
and from her excited and miserable state, she was
distracted by Hetty Carruthers' quaintness and
what seemed to her the almost theatrical pomp
and circumstance with which the house was filled.
To her country-bred eyes, everything about Mrs.
Carruthers was surprising, from the Paris gown
she wore, to the chair she sat in&mdash;just as French
as the dress. For Mrs. Carruthers was one of
that class of Americans who do not believe anything 
can be bought except in Paris, and who
thinks everything bought there must be correct,
especially if there is enough gilding about it.</p>

<!-- page 86 -->

<p>When Amy Carruthers chose she could be the
most fascinating little creature imaginable, and
hard it was for man or woman to resist her. Hetty,
who, though simple, was shrewd, knew her well
enough to be able to discern the difference between 
the charm of her ordinary society manner
and the subtle fascination which she occasionally
put forth. She was using this to-day, and for
Margery's benefit. Hetty was so surprised at this
and so much taken up with thinking what the
reason could be, that she scarcely spoke. This
was a great relief of Mrs. Carruthers, who had
learned so to dread the plain Yankeeisms of her
sister-in-law that she was only too thankful if she
preserved silence.</p>

<p>Margery was won, slowly, but surely. Before
lunch was over she had arrived at that mental
state in which she felt that if Rex had ever loved
this woman&mdash;if he did love her now!&mdash;he had
every excuse. But Mrs. Carruthers was acting in
the dark. She could not guess that Margery had
already been made so jealous that her admiration
for her would only intensify the feeling. She had

<!-- page 87 -->

no means of guessing at this, Margery's knowledge, 
such as it was, having been gained abnormally.</p>

<p>The experience of the morning had been one of
agony to her. Sir Charles had caught sight of
herself and Oliver, as they were going into the
garden, and followed them. He had no particular
reason for doing this except a gregarious instinct,
and a desire to be with Margery, about whom he
felt so anxious. He walked by her side, talking,
and smoking. Margery had to simulate some kind
of interest in the conversation, because she felt
that if she showed her distress of mind he would
become so anxious that he would not leave her
alone at all. This went on for an hour, till at last
Margery went into the house, saying she was
tired.</p>

<p>"Come with me, Oliver," she said, desperately.
"There's something I want you to do for me."</p>

<p>"Which means, the old fellow may go back to
the stables by himself," said Sir Charles good-humoredly, 
"all right, Madge. Did you say you
were going out to lunch?"</p>

<!-- page 88 -->

<p>"Yes, papa, to Mrs. Carruthers'."</p>

<p>"Pretty little woman, that! Well, I hope
she'll cheer you up, and you'll be just yourself
again by dinner time."</p>

<p>Margery walked straight into the house, silently.
Oliver followed her, thinking all the while.</p>

<p>She went into the drawing-room and flung herself 
into her rocking-chair.</p>

<p>"Make haste!" she exclaimed. "Send me off!
I want to see where Rex is!"</p>

<p>Oliver came and stood by her; and showed
some fruits of his reading. He simply looked at
her and said, "Sleep!"</p>

<p>He was rewarded by her almost immediately
passing into the hypnotic state without any
trouble.</p>

<p>"Do you see Rex?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered; and then she described
Rex as she saw him, standing in front of the harp-shaped 
gold and white screen, in the morning-room
of the old Hall, a strange look of embarrassment
on his face.</p>

<p>She had hardly described this picture when

<!-- page 89 -->

Oliver heard Sir Charles's voice speaking to a
servant in the hall.</p>

<p>"Where's Miss Margery?"</p>

<p>"In the drawing-room, sir."</p>

<p>Oliver said an ugly word under his breath; and
then very emphatically, in Margery's ear, he said,</p>

<p>"You will sleep this afternoon at five o'clock.
Now, <span class="smcap">wake</span>!"</p>

<p>She opened her eyes; looked at him; started
from her chair.</p>

<p>"Order the ponies out!" she exclaimed. "I
am going to the old Hall, instantly."</p>

<p>Sir Charles was already in the room. "&nbsp;'Tis too
soon, Madge," he said, "you needn't go yet. I
want to speak to you about that woman at the
lodge."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother the woman at the lodge. Oliver,
tell them I want the ponies at once. Don't lose a
moment or I'll never forgive you."</p>

<p>The two men were left looking at each other.</p>

<p>"I swear <i>I</i> can't make her out," said Sir Charles.
"Madge was never like this! It's all that infernal
brother of yours, I know. Go and order her

<!-- page 90 -->

ponies, there's a good boy, or else there'll be a
worse row."</p>

<p>Oliver went off, glad enough to get away at any
price.</p>

<p>"I must get this thing in hand somehow," he
said to himself. "It seems to me that circumstances 
are having the best of it at present, and
I'm out in the cold."</p>

<p>The ponies were ready in double quick time, and
so was Margery. She drove off without a word to
anybody. We have seen just how they arrived
rather too soon for lunch, at the old Hall.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 91 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margery's</span> own sitting-room at Hawthorndene
was a pretty little room at the back of the house
on the first floor. It was furnished with pink and
white chintz; water-colors and photographs covered 
the walls; there were hanging shelves filled
with paper-backed novels, and some very easy
chairs. The only serious article of furniture in
the room was a writing-table in the window, over
which the sun streamed for half the day. Margery 
loved sunshine; and at this table she wrote
all her letters, her notes of invitation, and kept her
accounts.</p>

<p>It was not regarded as a sanctum in any particular 
sense; anyone walked into it and talked to
Margery when she was there, or went in for books
in her absence. It was especially hers only in the
matter of the writing-table, which no one ever
used but herself.</p>

<!-- page 92 -->

<p>Thinking about Margery, and a sort of vague
feeling that he might pick up some idea from her
surroundings, led Oliver into this room soon after
she was gone.</p>

<p>Whistling, his hands in his pockets, the picture
of an idle man, he lounged in and looked at the
books on the shelves. A new French novel caught
his eye. He took it down and looked at it. It
did not interest him. He put it back and looked
round at the writing-table. There something
caught his eye which interested him at once. A
nice little roll of crisp banknotes, lying half hidden
under some other papers. How much was there?
He went at once and counted the notes, putting
them back afterwards just as they were. A hundred 
pounds. He walked away downstairs, thinking 
what a relief it would be to get off to town
and see what a night of poker would do for him!
Why not? This money wasn't much, but 'twould
serve. And again, why not? If he won he swore
to himself he would go no further in the exercise
of his power over Margery. He felt that in that
case it would be as if a higher power had interfered 

<!-- page 93 -->

to save him from acts the rightness of which
appeared so doubtful. If he lost it would make
no difference. His own position could not be
worse than it now was; and his power over Margery 
would he just the same. On the whole it
was worth doing. It would be a pastime, a distraction.</p>

<p>The two men lunched alone together, and Sir
Charles, who was always uneasy when Margery
was away from him, asked what time the pony-carriage 
was to go for her.</p>

<p>"She did not fix a time," said Oliver.</p>

<p>"I think I'll have out the phaeton and drive
over for her myself," said Sir Charles. "I'm sure
she is not at all well to-day."</p>

<p>This was about three o'clock. Oliver was getting
very uneasy himself, for he was exceedingly anxious
that she should be back before five. He had no
idea what the result of his experiment would be,
whether she would sleep at the hour he had fixed,
or no.</p>

<p>He felt that it would be very necessary for him
to be on the spot at the time, and still more necessary 

<!-- page 94 -->

to be alone with her if possible. For he was
resolved, come what might, to keep his power over
her a secret between themselves. If Sir Charles
once got scent of it, all its value to him would be
gone, and he had not yet even judged its value.</p>

<p>He wondered what had made him fix five o'clock;
but it is a very useless thing to wonder afterwards
about any action done in a great hurry. He had
thought, hastily, of the fact that Sir Charles was
generally out riding at that hour; and that had
been a sufficient reason, at the moment, for fixing 
it.</p>

<p>Of course she would be home before five&mdash;yet
who could tell! He urged Sir Charles to fetch
her early, saying he had thought her looking very
ill. This was quite enough to set the old gentleman 
off in a fume and double quick-time. At the
last moment Oliver insinuated that he had to a
certain extent lost his heart to the lovely American, 
and was immediately ordered to go also.
This he was anxious to do; for it struck him that
if Sir Charles found Margery all right, he might
himself yield to the fascination of the lovely

<!-- page 95 -->

American and stay to five o'clock tea. What a fatal
hour to have fixed!</p>

<p>"I must manage these things better in future,"
he said to himself.</p>

<p>However, that was not the immediate question.
The immediate question was how to make sure of
this afternoon and its opportunities.</p>

<p>He knew he could rely on Margery herself for
getting home before the time when she should sleep,
if she knew about it. But he had suggested it to
her while she was in the morbid state, and in all
probability she knew nothing about it now.</p>

<p>He got into the carriage with Sir Charles and
drove off with him. He determined to be on the
spot and act as best he might. He was a pretty
fair poker player&mdash;not so good as he fancied himself, 
of course&mdash;no one ever is&mdash;but good enough
to have learned some of the valuable lessons of
that game.</p>

<p>And thus it was that Hetty Carruthers, sitting
by the drawing-room fire, and feeling "awful dull"
because her sister-in-law was in the room and she
was afraid to talk as much as she would like to

<!-- page 96 -->

Margery, was amazed and unaffectedly pleased
by quite a bevy of good-looking men early in
the afternoon.</p>

<p>For Hetty was an admirer of the strong sex, and
liked old men and young men equally well, so
long as they were what she would call "nice."</p>

<p>Rex arrived first. She was eaten up with admiration 
for him. But she did not dare to talk to
him, seeing, as she could not but see, at once, that
he was a favorite with both the others. Margery
tried to disguise her passion, her jealousy and her
uneasiness; but she was unused to concealment,
and the attempt was a bad one. She could not
take her eyes off him, try hard though she did to
rivet them on the fire or turn them to Hetty's
beautiful flushed face. She was miserably aware
of his being imperceptibly and delicately appropriated 
by Mrs. Carruthers, who caressed him
with her words and maintained&mdash;or so it seemed
to Margery&mdash;a manner which conveyed the idea
that there was a mysterious understanding between
them. Rex did not appear to resent this&mdash;perhaps 
he was not aware of it&mdash;but he was to a

<!-- page 97 -->

certain extent ill at ease, and concealed the fact
rather badly, as well-bred Englishmen generally do.</p>

<p>Soon, to Hetty's surprise, his double appeared;
another edition of himself, only better looking.
For to her mind Oliver was far the handsomer
man of the two. The two faces had totally different 
expressions, and it was Oliver's which
pleased her best. But she lost her heart completely 
to Sir Charles, whose breezy manner delighted 
her in that drawing-room where everyone
was always, as it seemed to her, so stiff and artificial.</p>

<p>To her disgust nobody took any notice of her,
except for a casual glance of admiration at her
beautiful face. She was not used to playing wall-flower 
in this way, for at home her wild gayety
made her a great favorite with "the fellers."
The person really to blame for this was Mrs.
Carruthers, who was rude enough not to introduce
her. This was a plan she had adopted of late
when she wanted to make sure that Hetty's Yankeeisms 
should not disgrace her. As for the men
who were present, as it happened, they were all

<!-- page 98 -->

too much occupied with Margery, each for totally
different reasons from the others, to give more
than a casual thought to the beautiful silent girl
who sat by the fire.</p>

<p>Oliver looked uneasily at his watch now and
again. The afternoon was slipping away! At last
he determined to risk delay no longer. He approached 
Margery and spoke to her in a very low
voice. She started, and flushed nervously.</p>

<p>"At five o'clock!" she said, "what time is it
now? Oh, I must get home. I'll tell papa I want
to go."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carruthers was devoting all her attention
to Rex, apparently; but she was one of those
people who can see without appearing to see. She
noted the low-voiced speeches, the start and the
flush. She was quite convinced now of what she
had suspected all the afternoon, that there was
some little mystery among these people which she
had not yet got to the bottom of. It baffled her,
and none of the interpretations which rose to her
mind quite satisfied her intelligence&mdash;for in her
limited way, she was a very shrewd little woman.

<!-- page 99 -->

This did not seem to her to have quite the atmosphere 
of the ordinary intrigue&mdash;a girl engaged
to one brother and in love with the other&mdash;yet
what else could it be?</p>

<p>Just as Margery turned to go hastily to her
father, Hetty Carruthers' nasal tones fell on the
air and silenced all other voices.</p>

<p>"What's your name?"</p>

<p>She addressed herself to Sir Charles, who happened 
to be standing near her, disengaged. Quite
tired of her enforced solitude she had determined
to enter into conversation with somebody or other,
and took this mode of breaking the ice. Sir
Charles looked at her in amazement for a moment
and then a twinkle came into his eyes. He replied
quite gravely. "Why, my dear young lady, it's
so ugly I should be afraid to tell you; but I'll ask
Mrs. Carruthers to."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't trouble her," said Hetty, "it ain't
of no account. Most English names seem to me
awful ugly."</p>

<p>She had no opportunity for any further confidences, 
as Margery came up at this moment, looking

<!-- page 100 -->

very white; the flush had died all away again in an
instant. "Papa," she said, "I want to go home;
I'm so tired. Do you mind coming now?"</p>

<p>"Indeed no!" exclaimed Sir Charles, "not if
you are tired."</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry," said Mrs. Carruthers, who was
biting her lips and looking daggers at Hetty.
"I'll ring for your carriage."</p>

<p>Oliver, chiefly to distract attention from Margery, 
and partly for his own amusement, asked
Mrs. Carruthers to introduce him to Hetty. She
did so perforce, and then left her unlucky sister-in-law 
to her fate while she returned to Rex and
tried to interest him again. But he was watching
Margery, and paid little attention to his hostess's
beautiful eyes, and pretty words. She was puzzled
and disgusted, for she was used to feel her power,
under all circumstances; but she had the gift of
never showing vexation, and her laugh rang just
as merrily through the room as if it sprang from
pleasure.</p>

<br/>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Extract from Margery Hawthorn's Diary</span>.</p>

<p>"I must tell someone or something what has
happened to-night; and there's no one but my
diary that I can speak to&mdash;that I <i>dare</i> speak to.
For I am thoroughly frightened.</p>

<p>"Oh! Rex, Rex, do you love that woman? I believe 
you do; and in believing this I feel I have
lost my one only friend in all the world. For
I don't trust you, Rex, any longer. Oh, how awful 
it is to write that down; but it's true, true!
And yet I love you more than ever. What is to
become of me! For I want someone to speak to,
oh, so badly, as I never did in all my life before.
Even if it would be any good to talk to papa I
should be afraid to now, because I'm so puzzled.</p>

<p>"It is twelve o'clock. I don't feel as if I should
ever sleep again, but should sit here always
by myself, thinking. By myself, thinking! Oh,
how dreadful that seems! But I don't know what
else can come.</p>

<!-- page 102 -->

<p>"Oliver Heriot has gone up to town quite suddenly, 
by the night train. He told papa he had
been telegraphed for about his horses. I knew it
was a lie, but my tongue was tied and I felt I
must be silent.</p>

<p>"The last time I wrote anything in this book was
on that night when Oliver first made me do something 
without my knowing it. That was only a
little thing, though it made me very angry. What
he made me do to-night was serious, not that it
matters very much; only it seems to me, if I can
be made to do a thing like that without knowing
it, I may be made to do anything&mdash;anything! It
is a frightful idea.</p>

<p>"I had a hundred pounds in notes on my writing-table 
to-day, which I intended to pay away to-morrow. 
After dinner this evening I fetched them
out of my room, took them into the drawing-room,
gave them to Oliver, and told him to use them for
me in London. I did this before papa&mdash;and yet I
did not know that I did it!</p>

<p>"Oliver went off to catch the late train and I went
back to my room to write some letters&mdash;missed the

<!-- page 103 -->

money, had a vague idea that I had carried it
downstairs&mdash;went back to the drawing-room and
said to papa, 'What did I do with that money?'
'What money?' he said. 'Do you mean the notes
you gave Oliver? My dear girl, there's something
wrong with you to-day, you're so forgetful.' That
frightened me, and I said no more. I did not know
what to say. For there certainly was something
wrong with me! It was borne into my mind, by
degrees, like a faded memory gradually being
restored to life, that I really <i>had</i> given that money
to Oliver&mdash;and without knowing that I did it.
This seems incredible and yet it's quite true. I do
wish I had someone I could talk to about it! The
very idea that such a situation is possible frightens
me. Why, he could make me do anything, except 
love him&mdash;that never&mdash;no, that I do not believe 
any person imaginable could do! I feel I
hate him when I think of the influence he has over
me. But I suppose I brought it all on myself. I
never should have put myself under his influence
as I did. Yet how could a poor girl help it, who
was as madly jealous as I was, and knew there was

<!-- page 104 -->

such a wonderful way of finding out the truth?
Oh! Rex, Rex, it is too dreadful to think of. No
other trouble matters by the side of that! I feel a
sort of horrible conviction that you have never
really cared for me one bit. I suppose she jilted
you, that lovely little creature, for someone richer.
Well, she has enough money now!&mdash;I wonder if
she's happy&mdash;No, 'tis sure she isn't&mdash;she wants my
Rex again. Well, how can she help it? Anyone
must love Rex&mdash;I can't help loving him the same,
through everything. How I wish Oliver were
back again, so that I could see what Rex is doing!
I shall never, never dare to tell Rex a word about
this, all my life! it would seem so horribly mean
to have spied upon him as I have. I can't help
it&mdash;it's done! But I wish I'd never done it. I
should be ever so much happier!&mdash;I should have
no secret to haunt me all my life; and if Rex is
deceiving me I should not know it. It is much
better to be ignorant and happy. I wish I had the
will to swear to myself I would never use this
means to find out anything again. But I can't&mdash;I 
know if I took the vow I should break it. I am

<!-- page 105 -->

no heroine; I'm only a foolish girl desperately in
love, desperately jealous.</p>

<p>"I don't think any woman ought to be as pretty
as she is. It isn't right, to my mind. And yet,
how I would love to be as pretty! Then Rex
would really care for me."</p>

<br/>

<p>Oliver came back on the afternoon of the second
day, looking rather sullen. He walked into the
drawing-room at tea-time, and found Sir Charles
and his daughter together there: Margery sitting
brooding in her rocking-chair, pretending to read
a book which she certainly was not paying any attention 
to. Oliver asked for some tea, and she
gave it him. It would have amused or interested
anyone who understood the whole position to see
the covert glances with which these two studied
each other.</p>

<p>Oliver drank the tea with that unmistakable
"breakfast" air, which even Margery's unsophisticated 
eyes detected. Evidently he had been up
all night. Evidently he was not in as cheerful a
humor as when he went away.</p>

<p>His study of Margery was encouraging to himself, 

<!-- page 106 -->

from his own peculiar point of view at the
moment. "Fretting horribly!" was his mental
comment, "I can do what I like with her. How
she dislikes me! <i>That</i> doesn't matter, though&mdash;I
can soon conquer that."</p>

<p>He ensconced himself in a deep arm-chair before
the fire with just Rex's manner and in just his
attitude. This curious physical resemblance to
his brother was one of Oliver's characteristics
which annoyed Margery. For though they had
always been good friends she had never really
liked Oliver; and it harassed her to have him
remind her so often of the man she worshipped.
To-day in particular it irritated her, for reflection
over recent incidents had brought not only a dislike 
but a sort of fear of Oliver into her mind.</p>

<p>The furtive, uncertain gleam in his eyes seemed
to her much more noticeable than ever. Once she
caught him scrutinizing her, and this gleam
startled and disgusted her. But in spite of her
disgust she was conscious also that his eyes had a
power over her.</p>

<p>Sir Charles was delighted to see him back, for

<!-- page 107 -->

he seriously missed his company when he was
away. He had vainly tried to interest Margery
in his usual stable-talk, and now gladly overflowed 
with it to Oliver. It was not at all necessary
for the other two, who were both thinking hard,
to talk, as Sir Charles did it all for them. Oliver
used his happy knack of appearing to understand
all that was said to him, while in reality not hearing 
a word of it.</p>

<p>He had spent the previous evening and the
greater part of the night in some pleasant little
chambers in St. James's. A few calls in the day
had enabled him to gather together enough choice
spirits to make up a poker party, all of them with
plenty of money, for Oliver had spent his mother's
fortune in excellent company, among men much
richer than himself. The acquaintance of men
with plentifully lined pocket-books was all that
was left to him of his past glories. It was hard to
go among them with so little in his own pocket;
but he had paid the full price for learning to play
poker, and quite believed that he was skilled
enough now to gain some of it back again.</p>

<!-- page 108 -->

<p>But before the night was half worn away he
had lost his nerve and lost all he had. He was
too nervous then to stop, but went on playing,
just as a drunkard who has had enough must yet go
on drinking. The consequence was that he left
behind him several I.O.U.'s. and returned to Hawthorndene 
somewhat gloomier than he left it.</p>

<p>"Shall I marry Margery Hawthorn?" he was
saying to himself as he sat by the fire. "Can
I marry her if I make up my mind to it? The
old boy could set me on my legs again."</p>

<p>Sitting there between them he turned it over in
his mind. "Should he" almost overshadowed
"could he." It was hard to say whether, when
the prize was won, it would really be worth the
having. He did not mean Margery herself by the
prize; she did not weigh with him in any way; he
simply meant her belongings, her money, her position.</p>

<p>"It's hateful to think of settling down so soon,"
he thought to himself, "for that's what it would
mean. The old boy would look after me like anything 
if I belonged to his precious Margery. And

<!-- page 109 -->

belong I should!&mdash;that would be the confounded
nuisance. The old man would feel he'd bought
me when he'd paid my debts. To live here
always&mdash;with an affectionate wife and a talkative
father-in-law. I don't think I can manage it."</p>

<p>He leaned forward at this juncture of thought,
his elbows on his knees, and stared into the fire.</p>

<p>Margery looked at him, wondering. If she
could have read his thoughts!</p>

<p>But, though she was a hypnotic subject, she was
not a thought-reader.</p>

<p>To the thought-reader, if such a person really
exists, life ought to be greatly simplified. To the
hypnotic subject, who certainly does exist, it
becomes considerably more complicated than to
other persons.</p>

<p>Margery would have been horrified indeed if she
had been able to read Oliver's thoughts; but she
would have been saved a world of trouble later
on.</p>

<p>However, as fate would have it, she did not
possess this faculty.</p>

<p>"You don't look as if you'd been to bed last

<!-- page 110 -->

night," said Sir Charles, noticing Oliver's mood at
last; "and dear me, now I think of it, you seem
uncommonly fagged. Cards again, sir? Well,
well! It's no use, I know; it's in your very blood.
Did you execute Margery's commissions? You're
not the kind of young man I should intrust a
hundred pounds to," he added playfully; offering
for Oliver's consideration an illustration of truth
being spoken in jest.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Oliver throwing himself back in
his chair. "I executed them all right. I'll give
you the accounts directly," he said to her.</p>

<p>Margery bowed her head&mdash;not really in answer,
though it passed very well for a sign of assent.
She looked at her hands, which, clenched over the
arms of her chair moved to and fro ceaselessly and
would have told all about her mental irritation to
a shrewd observer. But she was always restless,
and her father thought nothing about it except that
she was not as well as usual.</p>

<p>He still attributed this to a lovers' quarrel. Rex
had not been over to-day at all; a very unusual
circumstance. What had passed between them

<!-- page 111 -->

yesterday? He had asked Margery the question
and she said "Nothing&mdash;nothing unusual at all."
Yet she had not spoken with conviction, because
she knew in her heart that she had foolishly let
Rex see she was jealous of Mrs. Carruthers, and
then had got angry with him because he had
simply laughed. The laugh had not pleased her&mdash;there 
was something in its tone which she had
not understood&mdash;and which she interpreted to mean
annoyance&mdash;as it did, only not of the kind she
imagined.</p>

<p>Yes, thought-reading would make life much
easier for most of us, though no doubt it would be
very inconvenient sometimes.</p>

<p>To a certain extent it exists, of course; only it
seems almost impossible to calculate on it.</p>

<p>Oliver at that moment had a flash of it. He saw,
almost visibly, the thought in Margery's mind.</p>

<p>"I would give all the money I am ever likely
to possess just to feel for one hour as if Rex was
all my own."</p>

<p>He gave a quick glance at her; got up from his
chair and stood with his back to the fire in the

<!-- page 112 -->

attitude of a man who is suddenly possessed by an
idea.</p>

<p>"It would pay me better to let her marry Rex.
She hasn't a notion how much he cares for her! I
shall have a full hand if I can keep her under my
influence. She'll have the Heriot and the Hawthorn 
funds both at her command. Rex is such
a fool I'm sure to be able to manage him through
her."</p>

<p>"What villainy are you plotting, Oliver?" exclaimed 
Sir Charles, the most malapropos of men.
"You look like the hero of a shilling shocker."</p>

<hr/>

<p class="center">CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a kind of lull or calm in the three
households during the next few days. The kind
of lull that comes before a great storm. Everyone
seemed to feel something ominous about it. The
state really arose from the fact that everyone was
in a perplexed condition, and unable to confide his
or her perplexities to any other person. Sir Charles
did the most talking; and he simply harped on
the same theme forever&mdash;What was the matter
with Margery, and who was in fault? He asked
these questions perpetually of Oliver, who shook
his head and said nothing. That young man
thought incessantly; but kept his thoughts strictly
to himself.</p>

<p>The calm was broken by Margery's dinner-party,
which brought once more into juxtaposition the
various elements of the storm.</p>

<!-- page 114 -->

<p>When Margery issued her invitations she had not
seen Hetty Carruthers, having only paid a formal
call at the old Hall, on which occasion Hetty was
carefully suppressed. But Mrs. Carruthers having
taken up Margery with so much warmth and
forced the acquaintance into an informal friendship, 
was compelled to bring Hetty on the scene;
and so, the day after the lunch at the old Hall,
an invitation for the dinner-party reached that
young lady.</p>

<p>"How'll I ever fix myself so's to stop tidy a
whole evening?" she asked Mrs. Carruthers in
despair; "and what'll I do if anybody speaks to
me and asks me how I like Europe, same as they
always do, seems to me? Ain't there any other
thing to say to an American gal, that these
stiff sort of folks must always ask me the same
question? And whatever I answer them they seem
scared, or else they all set to and laugh. I'm sure
<i>I</i> don't know what they find to laugh at."</p>

<p>"Well, don't go," suggested Mrs. Carruthers,
coldly.</p>

<p>"Wal, I don't know 'bout that," said Hetty

<!-- page 115 -->

dryly, "strikes me I'd be duller all by my lone
here. No, I guess I'll go, and I'll try and stay fixed
just as long as I can."</p>

<p>So she wrote her note of acceptance, rather to
Mrs. Carruthers' disgust. She was vaguely and
subtly annoyed by Hetty, beyond and above her
vexed vanity, whenever the girl's quaint speech and
candor provoked a laugh. Another and more
precious vanity was offended by the idea&mdash;which
she would not have put into words for worlds&mdash;that 
Hetty was really very much admired, and
actually sometimes distracted attention from herself.</p>

<p>There was yet another lady belonging to the
old Hall <i>m&eacute;nage</i> , who was invited by Margery,
though she had never seen her. This was Hetty's
great-aunt, who had been pressed into the service
by Mr. Carruthers when his wife insisted on coming 
over to Europe without him, and packed off as
a chaperon. She was, however, too infirm to be
anything but a decorative figure when Mrs.
Carruthers gave an important entertainment.
The old lady was just what Hetty would have

<!-- page 116 -->

become if left at home in her natural surroundings
all her life. She was pleased to be dressed up now
and again in satin and lace and diamonds, glories
which had only been words to her when she was
young; and was willing enough in return to sit up
for an hour or two in the drawing-room. But she
was not equal to going out, especially in cold
weather. So she lay like a queen, or some other
great personage, in her stately bed, and the two
young women came dutifully to show themselves
when they were dressed. She was well content
with her fate. A cheery, small-minded old maid,
with narrow interests and a kindly heart, belonging 
to the withered-apple type of ancient womanhood. 
She fully appreciated the luxury and wealth
that had come to her so late in the day, just so far
as she could apprehend their possibilities. To tell
the truth, when she was younger she would have
cared as little for it as did Hetty. It pleased
Hetty to be beautifully dressed, of course; but
still she felt she paid heavily for the privilege, at
the cost of having to sit up quietly at a splendid
dinner-table instead of having a good time after

<!-- page 117 -->

her own heart. She liked a farm-house kitchen
better than any drawing-room. The old lady's
tastes were much the same; but years had toned
her down, and she was well content to be waited
on, and pass her time in marvelling at "little
Joseph" (as she always called the millionaire),
having effected such a miraculous change in the
fortunes of the family.</p>

<p>The bed in which old Aunt Hetty lay was an
historic couch and had been slept in by kings and
queens; her coverlet was a wonder of lace and
needlework. She had ceased puzzling over these
things; but still in her heart she thought the great
oak bedstead a musty sort of affair, not to be compared 
to a brightly painted modern construction of
iron; and it seemed to her that the lace and needlework 
would have been more in place on one of the
drawing-room tables which, to her horror, were unclad 
and littered always with books and newspapers.
Her great-nephew's young wife&mdash;such a child to
look at&mdash;so gentle and winning in her ways&mdash;was
adamant in some things; and the old lady perfectly
understood, very soon after her chaperonage commenced, 

<!-- page 118 -->

what she might comment on and what she
might not.</p>

<p>"Every blessed thing's topsy-turvy now," she
used to say to Hetty sometimes in moments of
confidence. "Young gals like Amy used to give
in to their elders, but all that's over and done.
We ain't listened to any more; we're just figures
set up to look at. However, 'tain't no business of
mine, so long as Joseph's satisfied. And she is a
sweet pretty creature I <i>will</i> say, and just as sweet
in herself, too, as if she was made of honey."</p>

<p>"Good-night, auntie!" said Mrs. Carruthers
affectionately, her face lit by her lovely smile of
childlike innocence and freshness; and leaning over
the bed she pressed her red lips on the old lady's
withered check. How her little white teeth sparkled
between those red lips, and her bright eyes gleamed
like stars! A small half-moon of brilliants glittered
in her closely-braided bronze hair; but she wore
no other ornaments, and her dress, which had cost
some fabulous sum, was a marvel of simplicity,
sheathing her delicate figure as a glove sheathes the
hand, and with as little pretension. Hetty, with

<!-- page 119 -->

the vivid flush on her cheeks and some vivid geranium 
petals in her elaborately coiled hair, looked
like a strong tiger-lily beside this fragile creature.</p>

<p>"You're two bonny gals," said the old lady,
lost in genuine admiration, "and fixed real cunning. 
I wonder what kind of games ye'll have
to-night."</p>

<p>"Games, auntie!" laughed Mrs. Carruthers;
"people don't play games now at grown-up parties."</p>

<p>"Oh, but they do," put in Hetty rather eagerly.
"I heard that nice old Sir Charles talking about
some queer kind of game, they'd been playing at;
I b'lieve he called it 'willing and wishing!' Seems
like we used to play with the piano, 'hot and cold;'
but you do this one only with thinking; seemed
to make me kind o' scared; don't know why."</p>

<p>"Because you're a silly child," said Aunt Hetty,
"that's why." And she looked at this girl who
was like the re-incarnation of her own youth with
an admiration Amy could never win from her.
She did not pretend to understand Amy, who was
essentially a nineteenth century creature, mysterious, 
full of worldly and cultured intuitions.</p>

<!-- page 120 -->

<p>"Well, I don't know," said Hetty reflectively,
"but it strikes me, if there's anything in that
willing and wishing, the devil himself must be at
the back of it."</p>

<p>"Don't talk so violently, dear Hetty," said Mrs.
Carruthers with a frown. "Come, we must go, or
we shall be really too late."</p>

<p>She swept away downstairs, her aristocratic
little head held high with an air of conscious rectitude; 
and Hetty humbly followed her.</p>

<p>At Hawthorndene they entered the drawing-room 
like a pair of goddesses, all light and splendor. 
The other women seemed small and dowdy
beside them excepting Margery, who held her own
magnificently. She was like night, or the genius
of a storm, with her dark coloring, and her restless 
excitability of manner.</p>

<p>The pick of the county had been asked to meet
Mrs. Carruthers, and very pleased and proud it
was to do so. Obscurity of origin is nowadays
regarded as only natural in a very rich person,
especially if American, and such trifles are readily
forgiven in the old country when there is beauty

<!-- page 121 -->

and charm backed by enormous wealth. So it
was no wonder if Mrs. Carruthers, with her wonderful 
beauty and the reputation of being a millionairess, 
became immediately a favorite.</p>

<p>The dinner-table talk was not very brilliant, in
spite of the social eminence of the guests; the
crops, horses, hunting, and a poor attempt at politics 
being the range of subjects touched upon.
Mrs. Carruthers talked of the hunting-breakfasts
and shooting-parties she intended to give at the
old Hall, which made her conversation appear
very interesting to the others. A promise of
pleasure makes talk seem more brilliant than any
flashes of wit. She announced her intention of
giving shooting-parties especially for ladies.</p>

<p>"You're a good shot yourself then, Mrs. Carruthers, 
I conclude," said Sir Charles.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she said, looking up with her beautiful 
smile, "I'm a dead shot."</p>

<p>She had raised her eyes with the accustomed
practised sweep of the long lashes, intending her
glance for Sir Charles; but before it reached him
it rested on Rex's face, who sat opposite her. He

<!-- page 122 -->

was looking straight at her, with a most curious 
expression; he seemed very pale. Her lips
remained parted and fixed in their smile till it
grew forced and unnatural; her eyes remained on
his face. She conquered herself in a moment,
and looked down. Rex flushed a little and turned
rather nervously to speak to his neighbor. He did
not notice Margery's studious gaze; she had
watched the whole trifling incident; and it did
not seem trifling to her.</p>

<p>If she could have spoken to anyone&mdash;above all
if she could have spoken to Rex&mdash;but it was impossible, 
she brooded over her own jealous thoughts.
As for Rex she had lost her confidence in him.
Yet she loved him even more than when she had
it. For now she was maddened by the dread of
losing him altogether.</p>

<p>Nothing could shake her conviction that he had
loved Mrs. Carruthers, and that his heart would
inevitably go back to her. What memories of the
past evidently existed between them! To see Rex
flush and grow nervous like a girl was to her very
strange.</p>

<!-- page 123 -->

<p>Oliver roused himself that evening, and was in
an excellent humor; he shone as the best talker
at the table. County society did not amuse him,
but still he liked to shine; and any society
amused him better than none. He was essentially
gregarious and a distraction-lover. Anything that
pleased or amused him immediately brought out
his better side and showed him to advantage. A
good dinner, good wine, pretty and well-dressed
women, and the sound of his own voice, were
enough to bring out his charming society manners,
and he had another stimulant to-night&mdash;an occasional 
shy, liquid glance from Hetty's eloquent
eyes. She was the first woman the beauty of
whose face had ever interested him, and he was
distinctly pleased to read her artlessly candid
admiration for himself in every glance she gave
him. There is no doubt that to natures like
Oliver's, incapable of a sentimental passion, the
possibilities of feeling are just as strong, though
they are merely aesthetic and physical. Perhaps
they are even stronger, being certainly much more
temporary. To Oliver's pleasure-loving temperament 

<!-- page 124 -->

there was something exciting in Hetty's
atmosphere; in her radiant health, which gave
her such an Atalanta-like carriage; in her vigorous 
vitality, which seemed to impart some of
itself to those she spoke to or looked at; in her
immense and quaint simplicity of manner and
speech.</p>

<p>As for Hetty, she had already fallen in love at
first sight. All the "nice fellers" at home, who
were thinking occasionally of her, were entirely
forgotten.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Heriot was not at the dinner. He had
been asked, of course; but he had refused because
he would have had to meet his son Oliver. And
he was considerably annoyed with Sir Charles
for having befriended the black sheep. However,
as he said, that was no affair of his. But nothing
would induce him to sit at the same table with
Oliver, or, as he said, to enter Hawthorndene
while he was there.</p>

<p>When the men were left alone in the dining-room 
Rex went round to his brother, and under the
cover of a slightly quarrelsome political discussion

<!-- page 125 -->

among the others, said a few words to him on their
own affairs.</p>

<p>"I can't get the governor to change his views
the fraction of an inch," he said. "He's as obstinate
as a mule. I believe you've simply finished the
game with him. Are you being very much
pressed?"</p>

<p>"Confound it all, yes!" said Oliver. "But
what's the good of talking! I know you can't
help me. By the way, do you know anything
about Carruthers?"</p>

<p>"About him?" repeated Rex with a quick and
rather suspicious look.</p>

<p>"Oh, I mean his money. I suppose it's real."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Carruthers is a big name from New
York to San Francisco."</p>

<p>"Do you know if that's his only sister?"</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about his family.
What's that?"</p>

<p>It was the sound of a horse galloping furiously
up the avenue. There was something ominous
about it. Everyone stopped talking. A moment
later a servant came into the room and spoke to

<!-- page 126 -->

Rex. Sir Charles started up and went to him.
The atmosphere of death and dismay was perceptible 
instantly.</p>

<p>Mr. Heriot had had a fit. A doctor was with
him now. He was not expected to live a quarter
of an hour.</p>

<p>Sir Charles went himself to the stables and
saddled a horse for Rex himself before the groom
had realized what was wanted. Then came a
frightfully embarrassing moment, as Rex rode off,
in his evening dress, just as he was. Should
Oliver go? All the men were out in the hall, at
the open door, and Oliver in the midst of them,
startled and perplexed. Sir Charles and a groom
came round with a dog-cart. Sir Charles hurried
in and put on an overcoat. "Come, lad," he said
to Oliver as he passed him. This decided him.
He got into the dog-cart and they drove off
together.</p>

<p>The ladies were all down in the hall by this
time; the low-toned questions and answers were
chiefly about Oliver, for everyone knew his position. 
Had he really gone? Well, it was only

<!-- page 127 -->

right. The thought of death so close by quieted
and hushed the party, as it always does. Wraps and
cloaks were fetched, the carriages ordered round.
Margery, looking rather white and nervous, stood
in the hall to say good-bye to her guests. Hetty,
acting on the impulse of the moment, gave her a
warm kiss; the touch of her flushed, bright face
was very pleasant to Margery.</p>

<p>"Don't she look pale?" said Hetty to her sister-in-law 
as they got into the carriage.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's one of those clever people that can
look pale at the right time. It's a very good
thing for her. She'll have an immensely rich
husband now. Of course they'll get married as
soon as the mourning's over. But what on earth
possessed you to make eyes all the evening at the
disinherited brother? It'll be just like you to go
and fall in love with some handsome fellow
without a cent."</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 128 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Heriot</span> was dead when Rex reached the
house, quick though he was; so there was no
chance of any reconciliation with Oliver.</p>

<p>Rex was at once the richest man in the county,
and one of the richest in England; while Oliver
remained one of the very poorest, his possessions
being all on the wrong side&mdash;debts.</p>

<p>He was frightfully embittered by the way
things had fallen out. He began to cherish the
idea so beloved by unfortunate men, that fate had
a spite against him.</p>

<p>He was convinced that if he could have seen
his father before his death he would never have
been left absolutely penniless. It was too unjust!</p>

<p>But it had happened. These incredible things,
which it seems never could happen to ourselves,
do occur, and we have to face them.</p>

<p>Oliver's creditors, far and wide, learned the

<!-- page 129 -->

facts of the situation immediately by that occult
process common to creditors, and which seems to
have all the necessary mysteriousness of a psychological 
miracle about it.</p>

<p>Of course these gentlemen had always been
under the impression that the two brothers would
be left equal shares in their father's great fortune.
Oliver had wandered through Europe with plenty
of money to spend, and with the reputation of
great expectations. What joy is possible under
such circumstances! In fact, he had his day&mdash;a
day, at all events. But, with the quick blood of
youth still in him and a passion for pleasure, he
felt that he wanted not only another day, but
many another. In the meantime his existence
was distinctly unpleasant, and he began to acquire
the furtive and uneasy feeling of a man who is
always liable to meet someone he does not want
to see as soon as he goes outside the house-door.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that men who feel very
fairly generous when they are comparatively poor,
alter strangely in this respect if they become very
rich. This is one of the odd changes produced

<!-- page 130 -->

by wealth and its "responsibilities." Rex did not
seem at all anxious to alleviate his brother's discomforts, 
now that everything was in his hands.
His father's cloak appeared to have descended on
him in more ways than one. With the authority
of possessions there seemed to have come to him
the dislike for seeing possessions squandered.
The solidity of the man of property had come
upon him, and Oliver found him as hard to deal
with as he had ever found his father. That was
how Oliver looked at it. He ignored, or was
unable to apprehend, that his brother was in love;
that he was able now to give a princely fortune to
the girl he loved&mdash;a fortune which had been left
him freely. While his father lived he had tried to
intercede for Oliver; but now he asked himself
why he should take anything away from Margery
and her possible children for a hopeless spendthrift, 
whose only use for a fortune was to gamble
it away? And Oliver did not know of one circumstance 
which influenced Rex more than anything
else. His father had preserved letters and papers
which Oliver thought were destroyed; they

<!-- page 131 -->

showed him to be not only a gambler, but a cheat.
Rex had found them, and they had disgusted
him as profoundly as they had his father. So
matters remained in a very uncomfortable state.
Mr. Heriot's sudden death cast a gloom over the
neighboring society, and there were no dinners or
dances given for a while. Mrs. Carruthers, who
disliked anything disagreeable, found this state of
things too dull, and carried off Hetty and her aunt
to Brighton, where the two beautiful Americans
and their wonderful toilettes were a ceaseless
source of delight to the promenaders. Two
months dragged by dully. Oliver passed most
of his time cursing his fate. He had no plan
evolved with which to improve it. He had no
money with which to follow Hetty to Brighton,
and moreover he preferred to remain near Margery 
and retain his hold upon her. With Mrs.
Carruthers' absence Margery's object in putting
herself under his influence was gone; and she
seemed to forget that she had ever done so. She
was happier than she had been for a long while.
Rex was constantly with her and was making all

<!-- page 132 -->

the plans and arrangements for their marriage
to take place as soon as possible. Sometimes she
fancied she must have been mistaken about Mrs.
Carruthers, her happiness seemed so near, and
Rex so well content. So that this time, which
was very dull to Oliver, was an almost glad one
for Margery; perhaps the gladdest she was ever
to know, now the first early freshness and complete 
confidence of her love was over. That is a
joy which can never be restored&mdash;a joy possible
only to youth and inexperience.</p>

<p>Oliver tried experiments upon Margery at intervals, 
anxiously testing whether he could influence
her without her wishing it. He found his power
over her was complete. It appeared as though
she had given her will over to him in her jealous
despair, and yet to be unaware that she had done
so. He found he could make her do small things,
such as moving from one part of the room to another, 
or changing her chair, without her connecting 
the movement in any way whatever with him;
and it always seemed to him that she forgot the
action as soon as it was done, and seemed surprised 

<!-- page 133 -->

to find herself in a new place. He was
afraid to test this lest she should suspect him; for
he knew very well that she disliked and distrusted
him, and would never put herself in his power
without an overpowering reason. But she had
done this, once and for all!</p>

<p>One evening he made her go through quite
a series of experiments, until at last Sir Charles
said to her, "My dear child, how restless you
are!"</p>

<p>"Am I?" she said, apparently quite oblivious
of the fact that she had not stayed in one place
for more than a quarter of an hour since dinner
was over.</p>

<p>He decided on making a crucial test. "Take
that flower from your dress," he said to her mentally, 
"and bring it to me. Say to me 'keep it&mdash;I've 
a fancy you should.'&nbsp;"</p>

<p>He had been a long ride over the farms that day
and had professed to be very tired in order to keep
Sir Charles from talking to him. He was lounging 
in a great arm-chair by the fire, with a book
open on his knees, and his eyes shut.</p>

<!-- page 134 -->

<p>A moment later and he felt something on his
hand.</p>

<p>"Keep it," said Margery's voice, "I've a fancy
you should."</p>

<p>His heart beat fast at this proof of his power.
He kept his eyes shut and shammed sleep.</p>

<p>"Well, upon my word, Madge!" he heard Sir
Charles exclaim, with a great roar of laughter.
"You are grown very mysterious and sentimental.
But what's the use of giving stephanotis to a man
that's asleep! Merciful powers, but the boys now
are dull dogs! Fancy a girl giving me flowers
when I was his age and my sleeping through it!
Not exactly. Shall I wake him up?"</p>

<p>Margery was standing on the hearthrug, her
hand at her forehead. When her father advanced
towards Oliver with the evident intention of moving 
him to a sense of his luck, she put out her
hand and stopped him.</p>

<p>"Don't, father!" she said, "I can't think why I
did it!"</p>

<p>She snatched the spray of stephanotis from
where it lay on Oliver's hand, and flung it into

<!-- page 135 -->

the red-hot fire. There the poor frail thing was
consumed in an instant, as some poor frail souls
are by the furnace of this world.</p>

<p>"My dear little girl," said Sir Charles, "you
are very odd and capricious. I declare I shall be
glad when you are married."</p>

<p>"And so shall I, papa!" said Margery, with a
strange long sigh that had something of the unutterable 
Lady Macbeth weariness in it.</p>

<p>All this while Oliver was apparently sound
asleep. He did not move for an hour at least.
But his brain was at work.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 136 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER X.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Christmas Eve; mild and muggy of
course, as it always is nowadays. How the climate
of England has altered since Dickens worked! It
is to be hoped that future historians of the world
and its experiences will look to fiction for some of
their facts, not only about human nature but also
about the globe on which that same human nature
has its trivial joy. Fiction writers are strangely
accurate, simply because they have no creed, no
cause, no object to serve by perversion of the truth
or even the glossing of it over. They record that
which they see, as effectively as they may.</p>

<p>It was very mild and very muggy. Rex Heriot
sat alone in his father's sanctum, at a table covered
with papers and blue documents tied with pink
tape. Such is the fate of the propertied man who
has a conscience.</p>

<p>He was tired of it, and bored. For he was just
as pleasure-loving as his brother Oliver, only he

<!-- page 137 -->

had a different kind of conscience. The house
was dull, and this room was just as good as any
other. When would Margery be here, with her
brightness and her gay charm which would transform 
all things for him? and the baby footsteps
that might come later? and all the glow and cheerfulness 
of home life dear to the Englishman?</p>

<p>The house was there, and the money: everything
but the mysterious charm itself. And that was
all contained in Margery.</p>

<p>Well, he must wait a little while. Meantime,
could he give her any pleasure, do anything for her?</p>

<p>He looked round the room. Suddenly he started
to his feet, took up a great bunch of keys and
hastily looked them over.</p>

<p>It was so long since there had been anyone to
wear them that he had forgotten the Heriot jewels.
They were all locked in a safe in the wall in this
room. What a Christmas gift for Margery the
brilliants would be! White Indian diamonds, of
grand size. He dimly remembered his mother
wearing them once, when he was a little boy, not
long before her early death.</p>

<!-- page 138 -->

<p>He soon had the safe open and dragged out the
various trays and drawers, sweeping the papers on
his table back in order to place them there. He
opened and shut the cases quickly till he came to
the diamonds. Madge might look the others over
when she liked&mdash;they were all hers to do what she
chose with and amuse herself with. But the
diamonds were a gift any man would be proud to
make to his bride; they were of enormous value
and very beautiful.</p>

<p>There they lay, gleaming and glorious, white
and ghost-like.</p>

<p>He would take them to her to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>The idea that they would give her pleasure sent
him to his solitary dinner in a quite cheerful spirit.</p>

<p>He knew it would surprise her for him to come
in the morning; all the better. He would drive
over and go to church with them. So thinking
he smoked his pipe and plunged into a novel. He
had found an excuse for going to see Margery
earlier than he was expected; quite a sufficient
reason for feeling better.</p>

<p>So, the next morning, carrying a rather shabby

<!-- page 139 -->

red leather case, rather too big to go into a pocket,
Rex was ushered into the Hawthorndene breakfast-room, 
where Margery, ready dressed for
church, was pouring out tea for the lazy members
of this easy-going household. Everyone was late,
and seemed rather proud of it than otherwise.</p>

<p>Rex accepted a cup of tea, sat down at the table,
and for a little while enjoyed the glances of curiosity
directed at the shabby case, which he placed on
the table in front of him.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember it?" he said to Oliver.
"Then your memory is not much better than mine.
I declare, till last night, when I was wishing I
had a Christmas present to bring Margery, my
mother's diamonds had passed out of my mind.
They're worth looking at, though!"</p>

<p>So saying, he opened the case and displayed its
treasures.</p>

<p>Oliver leaned across and looked at them with
narrowed, critical eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said quietly, "you are to be envied,
Margery. All brilliants and perfect stones.
Worth a small fortune."</p>

<!-- page 140 -->

<p>He relapsed into the discussion of tea and kidneys, 
and appeared to feel no further interest in
the stones, which, however excited the liveliest
admiration in Sir Charles and his daughter.</p>

<p>And Oliver, sitting quietly at the table, was
thinking to himself: "Those were the mother's;
they ought to be mine; she'd have given them to
me like a shot if she'd known how I should come
to want money. And how infernally unjust the
governor would be!&mdash;that prig Rex coming in for
everything, and my being left without a single
farthing. What a shame! What a burning
shame!"</p>

<p>He turned it over in his mind, this view of the
matter, till at last it appeared proven to him, not
only that the diamonds ought to be his, but that
they actually were his, and this presentation of
them to Margery as a Christmas gift some kind of
masquerade, or a subterfuge of the enemy. It is in
this light that he now regarded Rex, though he
did not allow it openly to himself as yet.</p>

<p>Margery's eyes were as brilliant as the precious
stones she carried when she ran upstairs to lock

<!-- page 141 -->

them away in her own jewel-box. "He loves me,"
her heart kept singing, "he loves me!&mdash;or he
would not have come over early like this to bring
them!" And it was of his love she thought; it
was the sense of that which made her glad&mdash;not,
as with Marguerite, the jewels themselves.</p>

<p>Oliver remained at home alone, smoking and
reading, while Margery walked away to church
between her father and her lover. She looked
brilliant. All her jealousy was forgotten, all her
fears and doubts, and the bitter want of confidence
which had so hurt her a very little while ago.
She was so young that this was but natural;
for was he not with her? And had he not brought
her the most precious things he possessed? He
had given them to her as to his wife. Very soon
she would be his wife, and then all jealousy and
fear and anxiety would be over forever.</p>

<p>Alas, poor Margery!</p>

<p>Rex came back from church with them, and
stayed to lunch, and stayed on all day. Everyone
was in the gayest humor, including Oliver, who

<!-- page 142 -->

seemed to have quite recovered from his silent fit
of the early morning.</p>

<p>When Margery went to dress for dinner Rex
asked her to wear the diamonds. "I will," she
said.</p>

<p>She dressed herself all in white and then lit up
her beauty by putting on the jewels. It is extraordinary 
how brilliants illumine and bring out
the beauty of a woman's face. It seems as if they
had been created for that special purpose. They
lend a lustre to her eyes and intensify the coloring
of her lips and cheeks.</p>

<p>Margery had never looked so royally handsome
as she did to-night when she entered the drawing-room. 
The necklace of large single stones had a
grand pendant that burned like a star on her neck;
such a pendant as one sometimes sees in the possession 
of an old family, and seldom indeed in a jeweller's. 
Rex uttered an exclamation of delight as
she walked into the glow of the fire.</p>

<p>"How they become you!" he said. As she
stood there, the firelight gleaming on her, a quick
movement of the head loosened the fastening of

<!-- page 143 -->

the necklace, and it fell into the white wool of the
hearthrug at her feet.</p>

<p>Rex started forward, stooped and felt for it.</p>

<p>"The clasp is an old one," he said, examining
it the thing gleamed like a live snake in his
hands,&mdash;"it must be attended to, will you put it
on again?"</p>

<p>"Try," she said; "perhaps I did not fasten it
properly."</p>

<p>He put it on again for her, and she went down to
dinner in her glory. But at table the same thing
happened. One of the quick, bird-like movements
of her head released the clasp, and the necklace
slid down into her lap.</p>

<p>She took it up and laid it on the table in front
of her. As she raised her eyes she met Oliver's
full upon her.</p>

<p>"Didn't you say you were going to town to-morrow, 
Oliver?" she said immediately. "Will
you take it with you and get the clasp attended to?"</p>

<p>She took it up and handed it to him. His face
was imperturbable. He held the necklace in his
hands and looked at it reflectively.</p>

<!-- page 144 -->

<p>"My mother was proud of this," he said.</p>

<p>"And so is Margery!" said Sir Charles.</p>

<p>"You'd better take it to Hunter &amp; Roskell," said
Rex, "they had it last, and stones get changed
sometimes."</p>

<p>"I'll take care of it," said Oliver. "Will you
give me the case after dinner, Margery, so that I
can put it away and lock it up till I go, or will
you keep it till then?"</p>

<p>"I'll give you the case," said Margery; and
then spoke of something else. He put the necklace 
down on the white cloth, and touched it from
time to time, looking at the different stones as if
admiring their beauty or recalling a past which
they reminded him of. In reality he was appraising 
their value. He believed he knew something 
about diamonds and could not easily be
deceived in them. And he was about right. He
could judge of a diamond or a horse with any
professional expert. It is strange how these great
sights are apportioned to some men and denied to
others. He was the only person at the table who
really knew the value of that necklace.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 145 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A period</span> of pleasure and excitement set in now
for Margery and for those immediately about her.
The cloud produced by Mr. Heriot's death was
rolling off, and people were beginning to think of
the coming wedding. Margery began to discuss
the bride's-maid question with the young ladies of
the neighborhood at afternoon tea-time. None
of these young ladies interested her; they were all
very insipid; still, there were seven of them who
must be asked unless the fiercest jealousies were
to be created.</p>

<p>Margery decided that the seven should be asked;
but decided also that her chief bride's-maid should
be Hetty Carruthers, whether this preference
created heart-burnings or no. She had never
liked a girl yet as she liked Hetty. In fact she
appreciated force of character and genuineness&mdash;not 
very common qualities in young Englishwomen.

<!-- page 146 -->

She felt that Hetty possessed them, and even now,
when Rex had almost made her forget her awful
jealousy by his present devotion, yet she felt a
longing to have this fresh, true-faced girl near
her. Determined not to deny herself this pleasure,
she wrote to Hetty at Brighton about it.</p>

<p>Hetty replied by return of post, accepting with
delight. In a postscript to her quaint little letter
she mentioned the fact that "Mr. Heriot" was in
Brighton, and had just been to call.</p>

<p>"She must mean Oliver!" exclaimed Margery.
"Then <i>that's</i> why he's never been back since he
went to town!"</p>

<p>"I thought he was sweet on her," said Sir Charles,
"and it shows his good sense. The Heriots have
a very pretty taste in young women, I must say.
At the same time I don't understand my steward
running about the country in this style without
my permission. I'm afraid he's a hopeless young
scapegrace, and I must just give him notice."</p>

<p>"Well, I cannot imagine what use he can be
to you, papa, I confess," said Margery, who was
very fairly practical-minded.</p>

<!-- page 147 -->

<p>"Oh, well, he has been, and he can be, if he
will. And it's so confoundedly dull after dinner.
What I'm to do when you're gone, I can't think.
Oliver must stop with me, however useless he is.
And I must make the lazy dog work, that's all."</p>

<p>This, however, was easier said than done.
Oliver had some friends down at Brighton who
invited him. His nights were spent at cards; his
mornings in bed; his afternoons with Hetty. Mrs.
Carruthers disapproved of him distinctly as a suitor
for Hetty, for she knew very well that he was
entirely penniless, and she had heard of his reputation 
as a gambler. This last accounted, to her
mind, for his apparent affluence of the moment.
He had dropped back into his old habits of living
as if he had limitless gold mines to coin money
from. Having seen many of the ups and downs
of life, and knowing better than she would have
cared to acknowledge now what the "down" side
of it is like, she concluded that he had been winning 
money at cards and was now spending it in
the endeavor to dazzle and fascinate Hetty. As for
Hetty herself there was no use in talking to her on

<!-- page 148 -->

the subject. She had given her heart away and
could not take it back. She was of the type that
loves once. There are not very many women,
perhaps, of this type, but there are a very great
many more than men think. They love not only
once and for all, but entirely; the very faults of
those they love are dear to them. These are the
generous souls of the world, sorely to be pitied
when they are flung into the actual struggle of
life&mdash;as all are, sooner or later.</p>

<p>Hetty was as happy as she could be, in these
bright cold days at Brighton. She looked exquisitely 
lovely in her excitement and happiness.
Oliver was unremitting in his attentions, and there
was no mistaking their meaning. But one day it
all came suddenly to an end, died without either
warning or explanation. He was not on the promenade&mdash;he 
did not call&mdash;the next day the same.
Mrs. Carruthers said nothing about it to Hetty,
but her curiosity was very much aroused, and at
last she managed to make some adroit inquiries of
a man who was a slight acquaintance of Oliver's.
She soon learned that he had spent the first day on

<!-- page 149 -->

which they missed him over a card-table in a
room in which the blinds remained down and the
gas lit for forty-eight hours. The fever had seized
him, and so long as the other players would sit at
the table he would not leave it. When he did,
it was to go straight to the station and take the
train. "For," as his friend explained, "he was
regularly cleaned out&mdash;couldn't pay his hotel bill&mdash;and 
they say he left some tidy I.O.U.'s behind
him. He's a perfect devil when the fit's on him&mdash;would 
stake his soul if it were worth anything."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carruthers pondered these things in her
mind, but said very little. She decided to speak to
Rex when she got back home, and if she could not
settle the matter with his aid, to send for her
husband. This last may be considered the greatest 
act of self-sacrifice possible to an American
woman who is having a good time in Europe; so
that it is evident that somewhere in Mrs. Carruthers' 
mental machinery she kept a conscience.
So she did. She did not regard it as in any sense
her duty to live all the year round with her
husband, to keep his house for him or order his

<!-- page 150 -->

dinners; but she did consider it a positive duty to
see that, while under her wing, his sister did not
marry a spendthrift and gambler. "Whatever
would Joe say to me!" was constantly in her
mind just now. And she shortened the stay at
Brighton, in order to get back and see what she could
do in the matter herself, before proceeding to the
extreme measure of sending for Mr. Carruthers.</p>

<p>Hetty was quite delighted to go home, for she
was very sure that Oliver had gone back to Hawthorndene; 
and in this she was quite right.</p>

<p>He arrived there late in the afternoon, and entered 
the house in the furtive manner which came
upon him sometimes; a manner which is instinctively 
assumed by people who don't wish to be
questioned, and which develops by subtle stages
into the rapid glance round, on entering a room,
and the covert glance back when in the street which
characterize the man who has definitely sunk into
the shady side of life.</p>

<p>Oliver felt like a man just risen out of a fever,
and wanted to recover himself a little before he met
Sir Charles or Margery. So he went straight to

<!-- page 151 -->

his own room and there rang for brandy. A plentiful 
supply of this tonic stopped the shaking of
his hands in a little while; and after an elaborate
toilette he looked in the glass and saw once more
the handsome Oliver Heriot he was accustomed to
see reflected there.</p>

<p>Sufficiently restored for this, he was also sufficiently 
restored to feel disgust with himself and
some pricks of conscience, which were a good deal
sharper than he liked. His disposition was one
which involved attacks of conscience which came
in their regular course, like neuralgia or recurrent
fever. He would go through a definite line of
reasoning about some unjustifiable action, in this
way: he would see it as an opportunity; he would
feel a profound confidence that if he took the opportunity 
he would be successful and fortunate,
and be able to get everything right again immediately, 
so that no wrong would have been done.
His conscience peacefully slept all this while and
let him go on rejoicing; but when, later, he found
himself unsuccessful and unfortunate and unable
to get things right, then it woke up and gave him

<!-- page 152 -->

stabs that were as sharp as if given by a dagger.</p>

<p>Why had he not repaid Margery the hundred
pounds he owed her while he had plenty of money;
it would have looked so much better to have done
it. He was horribly annoyed with himself for not
having done this while he could, so as to have
given himself a gentlemanly and honest feeling,
however superficial it might be, and it was a bad
stroke of policy, too, not to have done it, for it
would have given her more confidence in him. And
he knew he had lost that, when she was in her
normal state, although he could control her abnormal 
self.</p>

<p>He went into the drawing-room just before dinner, 
and found Margery there, with Rex, and Sir
Charles. She was dressed in black, and looked
wonderfully handsome, with the Heriot diamonds
gleaming in her hair and on her neck.</p>

<p>"Have they done the clasp properly?" asked
Oliver.</p>

<p>"Yes, it seems quite strong now. I am wearing
the necklace to test it, but I think it is quite safe.
What a long time they kept it."</p>

<!-- page 153 -->

<p>"Did they?" said Oliver indifferently; "when
did it come?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday only. A man brought it down in
the afternoon."</p>

<p>"I believe they had to make an entirely new
clasp; they said something of the kind," replied
Oliver.</p>

<p>"You took it to some place I don't know," said
Rex. "I hope none of the stones have been
changed! They do such rascally things sometimes."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear no," said Oliver, with a laugh.
"That man's the biggest swell out."</p>

<p>Dinner interrupted this conversation. Oliver
became very silent for a while; but he drank much
more wine than usual, and at last it had its effect
on him and he succeeded in talking to Sir Charles
with some animation. These two were left to a
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> after dinner, the lovers going off to the
drawing-room together.</p>

<p>"It's been confoundedly dull while you've been
away," said Sir Charles with a sigh; "you mustn't
leave me in the lurch like that just now. It's an

<!-- page 154 -->

awful thing to play a bad third all the time. Still
I like to see my little girl look happy and like
herself again. What will you drink?"</p>

<p>Oliver went to the side-board and fetched the
brandy decanter.</p>

<div class="center">

<p><span class="smcap">Extract from Margery Hawthorn's Diary</span>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">"I have</span> been so happy, and now it all seems
dashed to the ground&mdash;all my happiness at once.</p>

<p>"I notice that I never open this book or write a
word in it except when I am too miserable to speak
to anyone.</p>

<p>"If I live to be an old woman it will be strange
to look back through it and read of nothing but
the most wretched days of the past.</p>

<p>"If I live to be an old woman! What a strange
thought. If I do, will it be as Rex's wife? What
a strange question, when we are to be married in
three weeks exactly.</p>

<p>"But what may not happen in three weeks?
What may I not learn in that time?</p>

<!-- page 155 -->

<p>"To-day I rode over to Heriot House with papa,
to look at some alterations in the grounds Rex is
having made. We were all on horseback together
in the park, discussing the question of what trees
had to be cut down, or rather Rex and papa were
discussing that, while I was opposing any trees
being cut down at all. I can't bear to see trees
cut down till they are quite old.</p>

<p>"While we were talking a man-servant came
riding up and gave Rex a note. He read it and
then excused himself to us and went into the house
to write an answer. When he came back he said
nothing about the note. This was all right, of
course, and I should never have given it another
moment's thought if I had not recognized the man's
livery. The note was from Mrs. Carruthers. She
has come back. I was so happy while she was
away!</p>

<p>"Before we came home papa said to Rex, 'I
suppose we shall see you at dinner to-night?' and
Rex said no, not to-night, he had an engagement.</p>

<p>"I know he is going to dine with Mrs. Carruthers. 
Why didn't he say so, then, simply, as

<!-- page 156 -->

he would have done if he had been going to dine
at one of the other houses in the neighborhood?</p>

<p>"Oh! the thought of it is like a hand at my
throat! I feel as if I am being strangled, as if I
am suffocating, dying!</p>

<p>"I can't write any more now."</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 157 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER XII.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the day after Oliver's return when, for
the first time for a long while, Rex did not dine at
Hawthorndene.</p>

<p>Margery did not come into the drawing-room
till the minute before dinner. Oliver saw at once
the look on her face which he understood; a suppressed 
look of pain, and a strange glitter in her
eyes.</p>

<p>He knew at once that the demon of jealousy
was in her again.</p>

<p>He only drank two or three glasses of claret at
dinner. "I must keep cool," he said to himself.</p>

<p>Margery was very silent all dinner-time. Just
as she rose to go she spoke to Sir Charles.</p>

<p>"Papa," she said, "you must lend me Oliver
for half an hour. I won't keep him away from
you longer than that. He has been very lazy
lately, you know; and so have I. Oliver, do you

<!-- page 158 -->

mind helping me with my accounts? If I don't
get it done to-night I never shall."</p>

<p>"Why, no," growled Sir Charles. "When Rex
is about I don't believe you do anything."</p>

<p>Margery went to the door. She paused a moment 
before going out. Oliver had risen to open
it for her.</p>

<p>"Come up to my sitting-room in a few moments," 
she said.</p>

<p>"I will come," he answered.</p>

<p>He went back and sat down at the table, and
began to talk indifferently of other subjects. He
looked at his full claret glass and pushed it away.
He was a drunkard and knew it. As yet the
stings of memory were not so sharp but that he
could sometimes resist stimulant and act without
it. And he knew that his power over Margery
was the power over will. He felt, rather than
knew, that wine affected his resolution.</p>

<p>He distracted Sir Charles's attention by a couple
of clever stories which amused him, and left him
laughing over his wine, while he went upstairs to
Margery's sitting-room. This room was seldom or

<!-- page 159 -->

never used in the evening, so the servants did not
light it up. Margery had lit a pair of candles, and
had put them on her writing-table. She sat there,
before some formidable looking account-books.</p>

<p>When Oliver came in she looked up with an air
of relief.</p>

<p>"I thought papa would come with you," she
said. "And I know the very sight of accounts is
enough to scare him away. Shut the door!&mdash;and
come now and send me to sleep. I want to know
exactly what Rex is doing at this moment, and
what he does for the next half hour."</p>

<p>Oliver thought it best to simply obey her. He
had no plan of his own formed and he expected by
obeying her to certainly get some clew as to the
actual situation.</p>

<p>And he did.</p>

<p>Within five minutes Margery was in the drawing-room 
of the old Hall.</p>

<p>Hetty and her old aunt were there; no one
else.</p>

<p>Margery seemed to be groping about, looking
for something; and she said no word in answer to

<!-- page 160 -->

Oliver's questions&mdash;till at last she suddenly exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Flowers! They are in the conservatory, standing 
among the flowers."</p>

<p>"Tell me what they are saying," said Oliver.</p>

<p>"They are talking of you," said Margery.</p>

<p>"Of me!" exclaimed Oliver, starting. This
was quite unexpected. "Tell me what they say."</p>

<p>"&nbsp;'Your brother is evidently paying attention to
Hetty. This is what I wanted to speak to you
about.'</p>

<p>"&nbsp;'To Hetty! Impossible. He is not the man
to care for any girl.'</p>

<p>"&nbsp;'Why not?'</p>

<p>"&nbsp;'Well&mdash;I think not. I am not obliged to give
my reason for saying so, am I?'</p>

<p>"&nbsp;'Yes; I think you are, since he is serious
about Hetty, and I am responsible for her.'</p>

<p>"&nbsp;'<i>You?</i>'</p>

<p>"&nbsp;'Certainly. You know it, if you think a moment. 
We are not in California now; we are in
England. I am Mrs. Joseph Carruthers, and I
have Joseph's sister in my charge.'</p>

<!-- page 161 -->

<p>"&nbsp;'You would not long be Mrs. Joseph Carruthers
if&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"&nbsp;'Excuse me; I intend to do my duty. You
can see what Hetty Carruthers is. Do you think
your brother is a man whom Joseph Carruthers
would approve of as her husband?'</p>

<p>"&nbsp;'No; he is a scoundrel, a gambler and a rake.
What do you want of me?'</p>

<p>"&nbsp;'I want you to put a stop to it, otherwise I must
send for Mr. Carruthers.'</p>

<p>"&nbsp;'Which you don't want to do, with me in the
neighborhood, till you know what my intentions
are?'</p>

<p>"&nbsp;'I don't intend to consider myself in this matter.
Mr. Heriot you are very unjust to me. I am thinking 
of Hetty. You know very well, if you will be
cool for a moment, that I have my duty to do to
her and to Joseph, quite apart from other matters;
and we are none of us bad all through, you know.
I intend to do that duty.'</p>

<p>"&nbsp;'Yes, I believe you will. You are just one of
those women that are such an odd mixture! But
I suppose no one is bad all through. I suppose

<!-- page 162 -->

Oliver isn't, though sometimes I think he must
be. Of course he doesn't care for Hetty; she may
please him, but it's her money he really cares for.'</p>

<p>"&nbsp;'She will be enormously rich.'</p>

<p>"&nbsp;'She shall not be sacrificed to him then, if I
can help it. I know more about him than I did
while my father lived, since I have had access to
all his papers. Oliver shall never have a penny
from me, if he is starving, and he shall never
marry any decent woman if I can prevent it, let
alone a lovely girl like Miss Carruthers.'</p>

<p>"&nbsp;'Now I know I can rely upon you. Oh, if you
would only forget the past; a chivalrous, generous 
nature like yours should do so. Can you
not feel some little friendship for me?&mdash;appreciate
to some extent the struggle I am making? We
must go back into the drawing-room or the others
will think it so curious. But do think more
kindly of me, Mr. Heriot.'&nbsp;"</p>

<p>Margery ceased speaking, and sat still as a
statue. Oliver stood by her, almost motionless
too, but palpitating with conflicting emotion, of
which rage was the strongest.</p>

<!-- page 163 -->

<p>Presently a cold devil seemed to enter him.
He looked down at Margery's face, and spoke to
himself.</p>

<p>"She shall marry him, and kill him for me, and
I will step into his place. I'll take everything he
has, even Margery herself! I hate him&mdash;listen!"
He bent over Margery.</p>

<p>"They are old lovers and they were talking of
this love. You have not heard them speak of
anything else. <i>Wake!</i>"</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 164 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">"They</span> are old lovers and they were talking of
their love!"</p>

<p>He had blotted everything else out of her mind,
but had left this sentence to burn there. It seemed
to be written within her in letters of flame, scorching 
her brain and racking her heart.</p>

<p>She gave him a strange, wild look when her eyes
opened.</p>

<p>"If that's true!" she said, "I won't marry him."</p>

<p>Oliver was startled. Had he gone too far? It
was such an impetuous creature, this.</p>

<p>"Oh, you must," he said, without staying to
calculate his answer. "Don't let her take him from
you! You are much stronger than she is, because,
however much she cared for him, she preferred
another man."</p>

<p>"Only for money," answered Margery.</p>

<!-- page 165 -->

<p>"Well, you know how far such a sentiment as
that would go with a Quixotic fellow like Rex.
Do you really care for him?"</p>

<p>"Do I care!"</p>

<p>"Don't throw him away then. Keep him. She
can never take him from you while you care for
him."</p>

<p>He was experimenting in this conversation. He
did not know whether he really had any influence
over her when in her normal state. He had never
tried to talk her into any given view of a subject.
But he saw very quickly that he could do almost
anything with her; that her mind was practically
swayed by his. This was only natural, considering
how complete his control over her was in the
hypnotic state. She did not seem inclined to answer 
or oppose anything he said, but to absorb and
dwell upon the idea suggested by him. This was
what he wanted. He was afraid of saying too
much, for she seemed in such an easily influenced
humor, and he had learned that at such times it was
very possible to overshoot the mark. He suggested
that it would be as well to go down to the drawing-room, 

<!-- page 166 -->

or else Sir Charles would be coming up to
look for them.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Margery wearily, "we had better
go."</p>

<p>She rose and led the way downstairs. In the
drawing-room she sank into her accustomed chair
and began to rock herself restlessly to and fro. Sir
Charles had been studying the evening papers, and
immediately began to read something which amused
him, aloud to Oliver. This absorbed his attention,
and he did not notice Margery's downcast looks at
the moment. This was a relief to both the others,
who were equally anxious to keep Sir Charles in
ignorance of the real events going on around him,
and indeed he was. How little we know of each
other's lives&mdash;even of those we are nearest to, and
who are dearest to us!</p>

<p>Oliver, studying her face from time to time, concluded 
that he had really gone too far, and determined 
to take the first opportunity of lightening the
load he had left on her. It would not suit him now
for her to throw Rex over. He had resolved that
he would use her as his tool in the best way possible,

<!-- page 167 -->

and he believed she would be of more use to him as
his brother's wife than in any other capacity. There
was little use in remaining in the drawing-room
with these two while Sir Charles simply read aloud
the newspaper; and Oliver wanted to think coolly.
So he got up and lit a cigar and went out to smoke
it on the terrace.</p>

<p>"Papa," said Margery, the minute they were
alone&mdash;deliberately interrupting him in the middle
of a sentence&mdash;"I want to speak to you. Listen to
me. I have been wanting to speak to you for ever
so long; now my mind is made up. Put that paper
down and listen to me."</p>

<p>"My dear child, I am listening. But what on
earth is the matter? Are you in trouble?"</p>

<p>Margery got up and began to walk about the
room.</p>

<p>"I don't want to be married yet!" she exclaimed
passionately. "I don't feel sure of Rex; I think
I'm too young to be married."</p>

<p>"A lovers' quarrel," said Sir Charles, rubbing
up his hair ruefully. "I thought so. Come, my
dear, Rex is one of the best fellows in the world.

<!-- page 168 -->

How has he put you out? He can't have meant
it, I'm sure of that."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Margery, in the most utterly
despondent tone of voice; still walking restlessly
about and flinging her hands to and fro with an
excitable action peculiar to her.</p>

<p>"Well, well, if he didn't mean it, dear child&mdash;Boys 
will he boys, you know&mdash;what has he done?"</p>

<p>"That's not the point," said Margery impatiently.
"How can I go into that? I want you to help
me."</p>

<p>"As if you couldn't rely on your old governor!
You know I'm your slave, child. I've been miserable 
about you lately. But we old folks all
know what lovers' quarrels are, and that they have
to be put up with. You take things too seriously,
my dear. Of course you can't help it&mdash;young
people always do. But now tell me the whole
truth about the matter. It's only some trifle, I'm
sure; I've no doubt I can set it all right in a trice
if you'll tell me about it."</p>

<p>"No, I can't do that," exclaimed Margery excitedly, 
"I can't do that! But I want you to

<!-- page 169 -->

find some excuse for me to put off the marriage."</p>

<p>"Are you jealous of him, then?" said Sir
Charles, resolving at last to exhibit the great
penetration and tact on which he prided himself.
"Is it that pretty American girl, with the Yankee
twang? Don't be foolish, Madge; he don't care
a button about her. I know it's almost impossible
to take one's eyes off her, she's such a beauty;
but, by Jove, the moment she opens her mouth any
man would sheer off."</p>

<p>"What, Hetty!" exclaimed Margery. "What
are you talking about, papa? I never said I was
jealous. I say I want to put the marriage off."</p>

<p>"Well, there can be only one reason for that,"
said this intelligent old gentleman, "and that's
jealousy. Don't be hasty, my dear. Rex is
an honest fellow, and if he fancied another girl
more than you he'd own up to it, I'm certain.
He's not such a fool as to marry you unless he
loves you."</p>

<p>"Honest!" echoed Margery, in a low voice,
but with a world of meaning in the way she uttered
the word.</p>

<!-- page 170 -->

<p>"Yes, child, honest, and you've no right to
insinuate anything else unless you're quite certain;" 
said Sir Charles hotly. "And it's a hard
matter for a girl like you, who knows nothing
of the world, to <i>be</i> certain, let me tell you."</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> certain," said Margery passionately; "I
have means of knowing that you can't guess at,
even. I tell you I will <i>not</i> marry him! I will
not!"</p>

<p>She spoke in sudden passion, as if any semblance
of a calm discussion of the subject was no longer
possible to her. She was standing in the middle
of the room, her hand on the back of a chair.</p>

<p>As she spoke, Oliver pushed open the door and
entered. He had heard her voice raised, and
hurried in. Her last words fell on his ears like a
pistol shot. He stood still and gazed at her. In
a second he realized that this was the effect of his
own words, which were still burning in her brain.
Could he arrest this thought in its progress, before
it became translated into action? His movement
of the door had attracted her attention, and she
looked up at him. He caught her gaze and held

<!-- page 171 -->

her eyes with his. Raising his right hand and
flinging it out towards her, he ejaculated the word
"sleep" under his breath, but with as much force
as if he had spoken aloud. Her eyelids quivered&mdash;her 
eyes lost their hold&mdash;and the lids drooped.
She swayed slightly to and fro.</p>

<p>"She is fainting!" cried out Sir Charles, who,
during this moment, had been simply gazing at
her, lost in amazement at her last words. He
rushed to her and took her in his arms.</p>

<p>"Poor little girl," he said tenderly; "she is
altogether over-excited. What can have upset
her so? I'll be glad when she's married!"</p>

<p>He let her sink into the chair by which she had
been standing. She was not fainting, but she was
evidently unconscious, and her eyelids drooped
heavily on her cheeks. A strange look came on
her face as of one who sees a vision. Oliver came
and leaned over her, as she lay back in the chair,
her head falling a little on one side like that of a
drooping flower.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with her?" exclaimed Sir
Charles in the greatest distress.</p>

<!-- page 172 -->

<p>"I should get her some brandy," said Oliver.
He trusted to Sir Charles's distress to prevent it
being noticed that he did not offer to fetch the
brandy, and to the old man's quick impulsiveness
to make him go for it himself. He was quite right
in his calculations. Sir Charles rushed off instantly
to the dining-room.</p>

<p>Oliver stooped over Margery and breathed on
her forehead, then he stood upright and placed the
tips of the fingers of his right hand just in the
middle of her brow.</p>

<p>"You will marry Rex," he said; "whatever
happens to make you uneasy; nevertheless you
will marry him as soon as he wishes."</p>

<p>There was a second's pause and then she slowly
repeated his words.</p>

<p>"I shall marry Rex," she said in a tone as if she
were learning a lesson by note, "whatever happens 
to make me uneasy; nevertheless I shall
marry him as soon as he wishes."</p>

<p>"Wake!" said Oliver, and made a few upward
passes over her face and forehead. Sir Charles
was returning, and Oliver watched her anxiously.

<!-- page 173 -->

She opened her eyes, quiveringly, and closed them
again; then opened them wide. Sir Charles was
in the room now, carrying a glass.</p>

<p>"Have I fainted?" she said, looking from one
to the other. "Surely I haven't fainted? I must
have been asleep."</p>

<p>"You've been very queer, my poor child," said
Sir Charles; "drink this off, and you'll be better."</p>

<p>She took the glass and drank its contents mechanically. 
A flush began to rise in her cheeks
and her eyes brightened a little.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad to see you better!" said Sir Charles.
"I am <i>so</i> glad, Madge. You <i>are</i> better? That's
right. Now, tell me, you've only been over-excited 
about some nonsense, isn't it so? You
didn't mean anything of what you said about not
marrying Rex?"</p>

<p>"I shall marry Rex," said Margery very slowly
and deliberately. "Whatever happens, I shall
marry him."</p>

<p>Oliver turned away and went over to the hearth.
He stood there, looking into the fire. He did not
want his face to be seen, for he fancied it was not

<!-- page 174 -->

as entirely expressionless as he would wish. He
could scarcely believe in his own power; he could
hardly credit what he had this moment seen happen 
before his eyes. The phenomena of hypnotism
and mesmerism are so miraculous in appearance
that they often seem incredible to those who are
the actual performers; little wonder then if outsiders, 
or, to speak more accurately, those who
have never experimented, look upon them with
doubt and dismay. Oliver was full of triumph;
but a dreadful tremor disturbed this triumph.
Was it the devil that made this girl's mind a mere
instrument for him? It appeared impossible that
it could be anything else or anything less!</p>

<p>Sir Charles was enchanted with Margery's
changed mood.</p>

<p>"I thought it was only nonsense!" he exclaimed. 
"But why did you talk like that?
Well, well I won't ask you. You are ill and
worn out, I'm sure. Don't try to talk now, but
rest this evening, and we'll have a talk to-morrow.
Isn't that best?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's best," said Margery, in a very

<!-- page 175 -->

tired, indifferent voice. She was looking fixedly
at Oliver, and seemed unable to take her eyes from
him. He was standing with his back to her.
Presently she arose and approached him, holding
out her hands.</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?" she asked.
"Haven't I said enough?"</p>

<p>Oliver started and turned round. He feared
he had not waked her fully, and that she was still
partly hypnotized. Sir Charles stared in amazement. 
Her tone was so very earnest that it was
impossible to think her words were anything less
than tragic. They all stood like this a moment,
Oliver being quite unable to decide how to answer
her. Sir Charles broke the spell.</p>

<p>"She's not right yet, and she takes you for
Rex," he said, "that's what it is. She's got Rex
on the brain. Madge, my dear, go to bed and
sleep all this excitement off. I'll bring you a
night-cap myself. You must forget all this nonsense 
and stick to your good resolutions. Sleep
on them, and make them firmer."</p>

<p>He led her out of the room, she yielding from

<!-- page 176 -->

what looked like indifference, but which Oliver
much feared was a remainder of the hypnotic
state. He felt sure he had not thoroughly awakened 
her. But there was nothing to be done.
He stood by the fire, biting the end of his moustaches, 
and thinking over the situation in considerable 
perplexity. It is impossible for the hypnotized 
to conceal his or her servitude to the
hypnotizer so long as the sleep lasts in any degree.
It would not be safe for Sir Charles to see him
with her unless she was entirely awake. The idea
that she confused him with Rex in her over-excited 
state was brilliant, and Oliver thanked Sir
Charles for it profoundly; but it could not be
expected to continue as a satisfactory explanation.
However, he had got her into the right frame of
mind, that was one thing.</p>

<p>His deep rage against Rex filled all his mind
and destroyed for the moment any feeling of
doubt as to the righteousness of his actions. All
he wanted was to <i>act</i>&mdash;to get the marriage over,
and feel that Rex's cherished bride was a mere
tool in his hands, a slave for him to order

<!-- page 177 -->

about. What a triumphant feeling it would be!
How that prig should be punished! Yes, indeed&mdash;punished, 
and made to pay. Success is an intoxicant; 
and Oliver was elated with the feeling
that he knew one or two things more than his
brother, and could hope to outwit him. With
most of us wrong-doing is the result of impulse,
when the mind is heated by anger or desire, and
all better feelings are driven out by these passions.
Oliver had been swayed to and fro hitherto; he
had continually hesitated over what he was doing,
with the fear of hell-fire before his eyes. But now
this fear seemed gone; as a matter of fact it was
only that he was more violently enraged than he
had ever been in his life, and the strength of his
passion drove out the fear of consequences for a
much longer space of time than had ever happened
before. A black hatred for Rex absorbed all his
being, and he yielded to it as he might have yielded
to any less devilish passion, feeling its force as one
feels the fury of a runaway horse, and leaving
every thought of fear or of punishment till this

<!-- page 178 -->

should be over. It was deeply planted&mdash;right
down in the deep recesses of his nature. He was
one of those persons who readily feel themselves
ill-used; if it is not their friends who ill-use them
it is their enemies, or else it is fate or circumstances. 
Oliver was not driven to quarrel with
abstractions; he had felt ill-used by his father, and
still more so by Rex. This cause of injustice
done him had only to blossom out into the fierce
hatred and longing for revenge which he now felt;
and it had the firm foothold of a permanent sense
of injury.</p>

<p>That night brought him no sleep&mdash;a very unusual 
thing for him. Like most profligates he
habitually slept well. But this night was the
first of a long series; insomnia made its initial
visit to him. He saw something which seemed
like a crime, at the end of a vista of strange
experiences, all of which fed his longing for
triumph. His mind was intoxicated with the
visions in which his figure always stood erect,
while all others fell before him or crouched at his
feet. He felt like a gambler with a full hand.

<!-- page 179 -->

The delirium was on him; he must pass down
that vista and taste every delight it had to offer
him, till he reached the very end with all its
triumph and horror.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 180 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margery</span> slept heavily all that night, waking
late the next day. She was very quiet, and animated 
by a fixed resolution&mdash;that which she had
last expressed. She seemed to have no idea in her
mind but that of her wedding, and to be entirely
absorbed in planning the arrangements and making 
everything as smooth and easy as possible.
Sir Charles was relieved beyond words to find her
in this delightful&mdash;and, as it seemed to him,
thoroughly sane and sensible humor. Oliver did
not see her till lunch-time, when he very carefully 
watched and studied her. Everything appeared 
to have faded from her mind except the
one absorbing thought of her approaching marriage. 
This pleased him nearly as much as it
pleased Sir Charles, though from very different
reasons. Rex, when he came in early in the afternoon, 
was also well satisfied to find her in this calm

<!-- page 181 -->

mood. She had seemed to him very variable and
capricious of late, and, though she had struggled
hard to conceal her emotions from him, he had
been convinced that something was disturbing her.
That was all over, so he concluded&mdash;some girlish
capriciousness&mdash;and Margery was herself, only
quieter and of more set purpose than was usual
with her.</p>

<p>Oliver felt sure that the impression he had left
on her mind was strong enough to work itself out
to the end without any further interference from
him, and he determined to leave well alone. He
would have had to exercise greater self-control
than he found himself capable of at the moment
to do otherwise; for as soon as Rex's voice was
heard in the house he was seized with a murderous
rage. He could not trust himself near him. The
words Rex had used of him to Mrs. Carruthers
came instantly back, singing through his head,
and he felt the insane desire to go and throttle
him, which with passionate men is the result of
receiving an insult&mdash;especially a well-deserved
one. But that would not do, He could not

<!-- page 182 -->

afford any hasty or reckless retaliation. He left
the house and walked aimlessly away through the
fields, only determined to get safely out of reach.</p>

<p>But at last he awoke to the fact that he was
walking nowhere, in a very objectless manner.
He would have sold his soul had there been
market for it, to go off to some pleasant haunts in
town. But want of money inexorably prevented
him. What should he do then? He remembered
Hetty, who had been for some time out of his
mind. There was quite a serious motive in his
mind for winning her, now that Rex had vowed he
should not. And besides, she would be rich; she
might be of great use if his other plans should fail
in any way.</p>

<p>So he turned and took another path which led
him to the old Hall, and presented himself there
as an early afternoon caller. Mrs. Carruthers was
just going out herself, and no doubt would have
managed to have made him believe that Hetty was
not at home had not that young lady appeared at
the hall door. She came, with her old aunt leaning
on her arm, to see Mrs. Carruthers drive off. This

<!-- page 183 -->

was one of the ceremonies of the day, which always 
had to be duly witnessed. Mrs. Carruthers
delighted in creating a sensation, even if it was
only in old Aunt Hetty's simple mind. She loved
to drive her spirited horses herself in their American 
harness, which made the yokels stare; and
she dressed herself for it in the most perfectly
correct manner, and yet one that made her seem
like a tropical bird among barn fowls when she met
a chaise full of country ladies in the lanes. What
an unceasing wonder she was to these good creatures, 
some of whom really seemed to think her
hardly human. Her hands were so very much
smaller than any others in the county, and yet she
drove a pair of horses such as one would only
expect a very masculine woman to manage; and
who ever wore such wonderful little shoes, and
skirts so wonderfully furbelowed, before in country
lanes? So perfectly was she equipped that it was
indeed quite an occasion to have the chance of
seeing her get into her carriage. Oliver assisted
at the ceremony with all possible homage; for he
knew he was not much in favor with this imperious 

<!-- page 184 -->

little lady, and that spite of all the sweetness
of her smiles she would very easily find an excuse
to cut him out of her visiting list. He was no
more deceived in her than she was in him. He
knew quite well that she was one with whom
sweetness was second nature; that she would
smile even when sticking the knife in, should she
ever decide to commit a murder in that disagreeable 
way.</p>

<p>She drove off at last, and Oliver went in with
the others to the library fire. Aunt Hetty ensconced 
herself in her favorite chair and dozed;
and Oliver managed to get through the afternoon
pleasantly enough. The young Hetty was lovely
to look at, excited and flushed beyond her wont
with the pleasure of his presence and the freedom
from Mrs. Carruthers' repression. She talked
more readily than he had ever heard her, and succeeded 
in amusing him more effectually than any
woman ever had done. He reflected that life
really would not be altogether impossible with
such a quaint, beautiful creature, provided she
had plenty of money. But would the others ever

<!-- page 185 -->

let him have her and her money? "That little
Mrs. Carruthers," as he mentally called her, was
an almost hopeless obstacle. Could he not get at
that secret which lay between her and Rex, and
intimidate her.</p>

<p>If Hetty could have seen his mind! Every
moment that he passed with her she was falling
more hopelessly in love. He was entirely free
from the stiffness, the reserved manner, which
chilled and frightened her with most Englishmen; 
and to her ears his voice and speech were
marvellously soft and melodious. He literally
charmed her; and when Mrs. Carruthers came
back again late in the afternoon she found the trio
still sitting over the library fire, holding a blind
man's holiday. Other callers had been, but they had
been told Mrs. Carruthers was out; so Oliver had
had it all his own way, and had made the running
in good earnest. Never had Hetty looked such a
vision of beauty as when Mrs. Carruthers came
into the room&mdash;such a wonderful cosmetic is
pleasure. Mrs. Carruthers saw it instantly, and
understood the meaning of this beauty only too

<!-- page 186 -->

well. She came among them, to warm her hands
at the fire, in the sweetest, most childlike manner,
and with the frankest air imaginable. Oliver,
studying her with sharpened wits, felt sure she
would write to her husband by the next mail. How
spiteful she made him feel with her smile that
made one think of bon-bons! He determined,
from that moment, that he would assume the footing 
of accepted lover as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>And so he did; it afforded him a passable pastime 
while Hawthorndene was given up to wedding 
preparations, and he was unable to vary the
monotony from sheer want of cash. He managed
Mrs. Carruthers so cleverly that she could not
actually turn him out; he gave her no excuse.
He won Hetty absolutely, so that the girl worshipped 
him with her whole ingenuous heart, and
thought the sun only shone when he was present.
But he never actually proposed to her&mdash;he was
"hedging"&mdash;and he wanted to see Margery married, 
and find out how great his power over her
would be, before he showed his hand with Hetty.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 187 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER XV.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wedding-day came. Margery's quiet and
earnest mood had lasted uninterruptedly. Nothing
had occurred to rouse her from it, and Oliver had
carefully avoided doing so. Its intensity had
gradually faded, so that she became simply her
natural self; what she was before Mrs. Carruthers
had appeared on the scene, or any abnormal powers
had been developed in her. The misery she had
endured had left its mark, both on her mind, and
on her face, but these were lost sight of in her
immediate happiness. It was Margery Hawthorn
in her natural state, gay, merry, warm-hearted,
trusting, who dressed herself in her white wedding
dress.</p>

<p>Everything was perfect, from the weather to the
bride's bouquet.</p>

<p>The little village church was massed with flowers
and filled with the country people, so that it

<!-- page 188 -->

seemed quite transformed. Mrs. Carruthers came
in late in a wonderful costume, the like of which
had never been seen in the neighborhood before,
and looking like a flower; she absorbed the attention 
of most persons present. But the bride and
bridegroom were much too happy to care in the
least whether other people thought them the centre
of attraction, or not. Hetty, with her piquant
beauty, left the seven staid young ladies who
acted as bride's-maids with her completely in the
shadow; they seemed to have been invented only
as a setting for her. Oliver, who was best man,
and secretly a little sulky over the boredom of it,
feasted his eyes on her. The only other object
which seemed to have much interest for him was
the necklace on Margery's neck. She wore the
Heriot diamonds, and wonderfully well they became
her.</p>

<p>Among the guests in the church were two
strangers whom everyone stared at in surprise.
They were evidently Jews, and wore diamonds
worthy of a Rothschild. They came in very late,
sat down quietly, and watched the service to the

<!-- page 189 -->

end. They ensconced themselves in the porch to
watch the wedding party go out, and when Oliver
came by with Hetty on his arm one of them gently
touched him on the arm. Oliver had not noticed
them before, and he turned ashen pale.</p>

<p>"I'll come up to town to-morrow, and see you,"
he murmured, and hurried Hetty out of the porch
and into the carriage.</p>

<p>The two men quietly walked away down the
road, each lighting a cigar. They went to the
Heriot Arms and there demanded lunch. In the
course of that lunch they learned a great deal. It
was Mr. Rex, not Mr. Oliver, who had married
the heiress of Hawthorndene. Certainly, down here
in the neighborhood there had never been any
doubt or confusion about that; though it was true
that at one time Mr. Oliver was thought to be
sweet on Miss Margery. But that was before
Mr. Rex came home from California. Since then
he'd had it all his own way. And the beautiful
young lady, the first bride's-maid? Ah, she was a
great match, very rich, much richer than Miss
Hawthorn. People said she was secretly engaged

<!-- page 190 -->

to Mr. Oliver, but that she would never be allowed
to marry him.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Extract from Mrs. Reginald Heriot's
Diary</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>"My little book, I have something pleasant to
record in you, for the first time. Yes, the first
time! Every page hitherto written has been the
record of perplexity or distress&mdash;or what seemed
like despair. Now I am so happy I cannot believe
in ever feeling any distress again.</p>

<p>"Why did I ever doubt Rex's love for me?
How could I ever doubt it? It seems to enwrap
me now like a warm soft cloud that veils me from
every possibility of trouble or of doubt.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful world this is! The sands
gleam like silver in the sunshine to-day and the
sea seems to be a vast turquoise. How perfectly
still it is! There is the faint sense of life, of
vibration in it that makes its stillness the more
fascinating. It is just like my heart&mdash;silent from

<!-- page 191 -->

intensity of content, but beating all the while, and
ready to flame out into excitement at a touch.</p>

<p>"Why was I ever unhappy, or jealous, or doubting? 
Because I was not with Rex, I suppose.
Now I shall never be unhappy again. The fulness 
of content I feel is so profound that it must
last always; I can never exhaust it. I fancy I
am like one favored being in a dry land where
there is no water&mdash;one who is given the secret of
a magic well full of sweetness. People seem to
grow old and tired in this world, but that is because 
they have no magic well like mine to drink
from&mdash;a deep well of perfect love and trust and
mutual confidence.</p>

<p>"What a wonderful honeymoon mine has been.&mdash;why 
do I say has been! It is only half over.
But I find it hard to believe that week after week
can follow on, so full of gay contentment. They
say the bride is happy whom the sun shines on.
It shone on my wedding-day&mdash;it has shone ever
since; there has not been one drop of rain or one
cloud. Surely never was a bride so fortunate.
All day long we have been out in our little boat,

<!-- page 192 -->

dreaming the hours away between the blue sea
and the blue sky, separated by the atmosphere
of love and sunshine from all the cruel world.
Well, when the rain comes&mdash;or when we have to
be among other people again&mdash;still I am confident
this atmosphere will be round us always. We
shall always be in the sunshine of love now.
My soul, my very soul, seems to have become a
part of the man I love. I can never feel any
shadow between us again. My Rex, why didn't I
trust you always! That's what puzzles me. I
suppose it was the intensity of my love made
me jealous. Now I love you too well for such
folly, and added intensity has given me perfect 
confidence.</p>

<p>"To-day Rex has left me for the first time, to go
up to town to see his solicitors about something
or other. I thought I should suffer when I was
left alone for the first time, and so I did, for a few
minutes. It was like a stab at my heart&mdash;a knife
stuck into me&mdash;to see him go off by the train and
leave me. But that was only for a few minutes;
it left me directly, and I fell into one long dream

<!-- page 193 -->

of memory&mdash;of his smile, of his tenderness, of his
love&mdash;Ah, Rex! my dear Rex!&mdash;and I am dwelling 
deeply in it still. I could sit and dream and
dream and remember for months and years, and
yet be happy. But that would never be unless I
lost him, and I shall never lose him; for when
he dies I shall die at the same moment, and nothing 
but death can part us!</p>

<p>"There, there he is! There he is! crossing the
sands. Why is he back so quickly? Could he
not bear to be away from me? I must fly to meet
him. Good-bye, little book, till I am sad or alone
again."</p>

<br/>

<p>Margery Heriot hurried down the staircase of
the pretty cottage in which she was spending her
happy honeymoon, and went quickly into the
wide porch, wreathed with a great mass of clustering 
ivy. The place was a perfect nook of fairy-land, 
surrounded by green grass and trees and
shrubs, yet standing close upon the sand and sea.
Rex had seen it by chance one day and determined
to stay in its deep restfulness as long as Margery 

<!-- page 194 -->

was content, and was not Margery content?
She stood framed in the porch like a goddess, and
her chief charm was not that of beauty so much
as supreme happiness. But she was very beautiful
at this time, her vivid face full of glow, her expressive 
eyes speaking sweet thoughts.</p>

<p>The man she had come to meet quickly approached 
the house. As he neared it, suddenly
Margery's face changed. "My God!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>It was Oliver.</p>

<p>She had almost forgotten his existence. She
didn't want to see him. She moved back, thinking
to retreat into the cottage and deny herself to him,
for he seemed to bring some of the old distress
with him.</p>

<p>But already he stood in the porch, and his gaze
had caught hers. She stared blankly back at him.</p>

<p>"You don't seem very pleased to see me," he
observed, in a dry tone. "You're in the 'Edwin
and Angelina' condition yet then? You don't
want either a friend or an enemy. That's nice for
you; but mayn't I stay a minute or two?"</p>

<!-- page 195 -->

<p>Margery sank down on the bench in the porch,
under the shadow of the heavy drooping ivy.</p>

<p>"Why, of course I'm pleased to see you," she
said, trying to recover herself; "only you startled
me. I thought you were Rex. Really, I took you
for him as you crossed the sands, and I couldn't think
what had brought him back so suddenly. He's
gone up to town," she added, by way of explanation.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know that," he answered; and then, after
a pause, "Don't you think it's chilly here? Mayn't
we go in?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course," said Margery, rising. She
led the way into the drawing-room, which seemed
so little and so low after the great rooms at Hawthorndene; 
but how she loved it and its quaint
homeliness! The tables were crowded with flowers,
which were a passion with her. On her writing-table 
lay her diary; but it was closed and locked.
That was the one confidante who knew more of her
than Rex, as yet. She had not come to the hour
when she would give it him to read; she was intending 
to do it; but she did not want the idea of
her jealousy to bring any cloud on their content.

<!-- page 196 -->

And as it was all a thing of the past she thought
it might wait.</p>

<p>A fire burned on the hearth, looking bright and
pleasant. Margery sat down beside it, in a low
chair, and said nothing, leaving Oliver to commence 
the conversation. He began to talk, in a
desultory way, about Sir Charles and the doings at
Hawthorndene. Margery sat idly looking at the
fire. Suddenly she felt his hand on her forehead,
and heard the dreadful word "Sleep!" in her
ears. A profound wave of stupor swept suddenly
over her brain. She struggled against it&mdash;cried
out inarticulately&mdash;tried to rise, but Oliver's hand
was passing over her face; he reiterated the word
of command. Her arms fell powerless at her sides,
and her eyelids drooped as though weighed down
by mill-stones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Extract from Mrs. Reginald Heriot's
Diary</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>"I have to open this book, for I must write
down my feelings, since I cannot speak them.</p>

<!-- page 197 -->

<p>"Once again I write to record terror, and perplexity, 
and almost despair.</p>

<p>"It was not Rex whom I met at the door, but that
other, so terribly like him that he deceives even
my loving eyes at a little distance.</p>

<p>"He made me sleep. I could not resist. He
changed me, made me another creature, a different
woman.</p>

<p>"He wanted money, and I had to get it for him.
When I woke I knew nothing else than that, and
that I was not to let Rex know he had been here.
I could not disobey him or even question him. I
was spellbound.</p>

<p>"He went immediately, and left me alone. I was
not really alone though; it seemed as if his spirit
was by my side, compelling me to act.</p>

<p>"That money must be got, and sent to him. It
had to be done. I had no power to dispute the
fact. Nor have I now. I have to do it, and I
do not know how. I did not know then, except
by an awful plan which filled my soul with horror;
but I had to do it. There was no help for it.
There was no other way.</p>

<!-- page 198 -->

<p>"Rex was not to be back till the following day.
I took the next train to town and went straight to
the bank, where I had left the Heriot diamonds
with my mother's jewels. My mother's pretty
things were valuable, but not sufficiently so; if I
sacrificed them all they would not bring what
Oliver demanded. I knew that I must steal, that
I must deceive Rex, but it did not trouble me.
I only knew I had to do it, and I went to work
like one in a dream, helplessly obeying my orders.</p>

<p>"I took out the diamonds and went straight to
our family jewellers in Bond Street, where I know
one of the partners very well. I thought it would
be easier to tell him what I wanted than a stranger,
and besides he knew the value of the stones very
well, having re-set them once for Mrs. Heriot.
I should have to humiliate myself to him to get
him to preserve secrecy; but I must bear that. I
felt at all events I could trust him.</p>

<p>"Never shall I forget the blow he dealt me!
Shall I ever recover from it?</p>

<p>"I saw him in his own private room and tremblingly 
told him that I had a dreadful necessity to

<!-- page 199 -->

realize on the diamonds; that I preferred only to
have an advance on them, as I must redeem them
when I could and restore them safely. Oh, how
my pride suffered as I talked to this man! He
seemed to look at me so strangely from time to
time.</p>

<p>"He took the jewels from me and turned them
over in his hands. Suddenly he rose, and excusing 
himself left the room for a few moments, carrying 
them with him. Presently he brought them
back, put them on the table and looked at me
more strangely than ever.</p>

<p>"&nbsp;'I am very sorry," he said in a low, very distinct 
voice. 'I don't know if you are aware of it,
but I am afraid I cannot help you. These are
not the Heriot diamonds. These are paste.'</p>

<p>"I started up as if electrified, and stood trembling 
all over. At last I found my voice.</p>

<p>"&nbsp;'It's too late to go back to the bank,' I said.
'Will you keep them for me? and will you keep
all this secret? for my sake, for my father's? for
my husband's? I must think what to do!'</p>

<!-- page 200 -->

<p>"He promised, and I left him and came home, in
a hopeless daze.</p>

<p>"Of course I understood what had happened.
And I understood what a devil Oliver Heriot is.
An incarnate devil he must be! Yet I cannot
resist his will. I know I have to obey him&mdash;I
know I have to get that money for him. What
am I to do?</p>

<p>"Oh, where is my happiness flown? Rex will
be back soon&mdash;thank Heaven, he has been delayed.
I don't want him to come&mdash;I don't want him to
come! Is not that horrible!"</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 201 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER XVI.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margery</span> was sitting alone in her room writing
in her diary. She laid down her pen at last, unable
to write more, for the thoughts in her mind seemed
too horrible for words. That she did not want Rex
to return&mdash;that she dared not face him&mdash;that she
did not know how to face him&mdash;filled her with dismay. 
Could she be held responsible for the disappearance 
of the Heriot diamonds? Was it in
any way her doing or her fault? Impossible! no
one demurred at Oliver's taking them to town&mdash;no
one would have dreamed of doing so; for though
a profligate, he was a Heriot, and had never been
known to do anything actually dishonest. She felt
grateful for one thing only in the whole affair&mdash;that 
she had given the diamonds into Oliver's charge
in Rex's presence. Why she did so she could not
tell; she wondered at it now; and when it occurred
to her that Oliver had perhaps used his influence

<!-- page 202 -->

over her to make her do it, she laughed at herself
for such a far-fetched notion. She was quite unable
to measure, or even to guess at, the extent of his
power over her. The inexplicable impulses which
came to her sometimes, and which she felt absolutely
compelled to obey&mdash;these she imagined sprang from
the impulsiveness and variability of her own
nature. It distressed and perplexed her to try and
find out where her own will ceased to act, and she
tried to prevent herself from thinking of the subject.</p>

<p>But it was impossible! Why was she bowed
down now with the overpowering sense that she
had to find this money for Oliver? Why, when
he had absolutely no kind of claim on her? Her
mind tried to struggle from the spell that was on
it, to free itself from the shackles that held it, but
the effort was useless. She was as incapable of
removing the idea that oppressed her from her
mind, as a person who is drugged is incapable of
physical movement.</p>

<p>She sat at the table, still, lost in thought, or rather
in the desperate attempt to think. She had a few
hours yet before Rex's return to determine what to

<!-- page 203 -->

do. Her longing was to tell him everything, to
show him her diary, to get him to help her. If
she had done this, all the rest of her life would
have been changed. If she had given up her will
to Rex as she had given it to Oliver, his power over
her would have been much the stronger because of
the affection between them. But it was not to be.
Sitting there alone with her thoughts it seemed to
her that she entered into some sort of sleep, though
her eyes were open; it seemed to her that she felt
a touch on her forehead, and that <i>something</i> stood
beside her! No&mdash;not something&mdash;it was no indefinite 
presence; though invisible, it was no unknown 
shadow&mdash;it was Oliver.</p>

<p>She felt him as plainly as though he were physically 
present; but the distress was infinitely greater.
A chill passed through all her frame, the dread
chill of the supernatural, and the cold from it benumbed 
her mind and heart and made her a helpless
subject, without power to think or feel for herself.
She only knew she had to obey the awful power
that controlled her.</p>

<p>So ignorant are we of the powers we wield, that

<!-- page 204 -->

Oliver was simply trying an experiment, and was
unable to ascertain whether he was successful. He
resolved to put it to the test, and left her with an
absolute command, which she had to obey at once,
and whether she did so or not would prove to him
whether she had understood his voice&mdash;whether
he had indeed conquered matters and was able to
influence her as easily from a distance as when
he actually touched her and breathed on her.</p>

<p>He found it was so. His success exceeded his
wildest expectations.</p>

<p>"Before I sleep," said Margery to herself when
the cold chill began to leave her a little, "I must
write to Oliver and tell him I will get that money
for him immediately."</p>

<p>She could not rest till this was done; when the
note&mdash;which consisted simply of those words&mdash;was
written, she put on a cloak and went out to post
it, late though it was.</p>

<p>When she came back she lay down on a couch
in the drawing-room, wrapped in her cloak. She
could not bring herself to go back to her own room.
She felt a horror of it. She had the hopeless fear

<!-- page 205 -->

upon her which always affects those who believe
themselves haunted. All other thoughts were
driven out of her mind by the one dread of feeling
that cold touch again&mdash;of becoming aware of that
unearthly presence beside her! Not even the
miserable consciousness that she had no idea how
to get this money had the power to dispel the overmastering 
dread that made her quiver. The thought
that she had no means of satisfying the demand
upon her came back into her mind at intervals, but
each time she said wildly to herself that some way
would come&mdash;some inspiration. It would have to
be done&mdash;there was no escape. She had to find
the way for herself; that she knew. She could
never tell Rex anything&mdash;never! That was firmly
fixed in her mind and she had it before her mental
eyes always as a positive certainty. She would be
lost, ruined, unhappy forever, if she took Rex into
her confidence in any particular. Oliver had taken
good care in his ghostly visitation, to leave this
impression thoroughly implanted. He had reiterated 
and reiterated the words "You will be
lost, ruined, unhappy forever if you tell Rex anything 

<!-- page 206 -->

whatever about me." Her precious happiness! 
How she loved Rex Heriot! Her poor
faithful heart beat for him only; she lived for him
only. She would suffer anything, bear anything,
do anything, so that the joy she found with her
husband should never be disturbed. A quivering
martyr, she lay there through the long hours of
the night, resolved only upon any sacrifice that
might be necessary to retain her happiness.</p>

<p>In the morning, when the housemaid came to
open the drawing-room shutters she found the
lamps still burning, and Mrs. Heriot lying on the
couch in a restless, broken sleep, wrapped in her
fur cloak. The girl was frightened and went for
the other servants. When Margery opened her
eyes intelligently she found herself in a flower-scented 
room lit with sunshine; the servants were
grouped round her&mdash;the cook was pouring raw
brandy down her throat, the only specific she had
any respect for personally; the first few drops had
had a miraculous effect;&mdash;in the doorway stood
Rex, aghast, amazed. He was wrapped up in a
long ulster, with a travelling cap firmly wedged on

<!-- page 207 -->

to his head, just as he had come out of the night
train. At the sight of him all the loving woman
in Margery was alive, and for the moment everything 
else was forgotten; it seemed as though she
had come out of a nightmare to the fresh sweetness
of natural life. She sprang from the sofa, rushed
to him and flung her arms round his neck.
What a moment of supreme joy that was when she
hid her face on his shoulder and forgot everything
in the world, everything she had ever felt or thought
except her love for him, her confidence in him!
This, at least, was a man, a noble creature to confide
in and to trust. It was like salve on a wound, the
very sense of his nobility and his strong presence.</p>

<p>He held her in his arms and stroked the dark hair
that had come unloosed and lay all tossed upon
her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Has she been ill?" he said.</p>

<p>"I didn't know she was ill, sir," said the housemaid. 
"Not till I found her here this morning."</p>

<p>Rex said nothing more, but lifted Margery in his
arms and carried her upstairs into her own room.
He was a great strong fellow, and though Margery

<!-- page 208 -->

was by no means ethereal, it was very easy for him
to do this. He enjoyed the sense of power it gave
him. He locked the door when he had laid her on
her bed, and throwing off his ulster, set himself to
wait upon her with all the delicacy and tenderness
of a true nurse. Strong men who have the capacity 
for protection are usually very tender; and so
it was with Rex. The combination of these characteristics 
was partly what made him so lovable.
Margery clung to him with the desperate feeling
that he was the only being who could save her,
and yet knew that she could never ask him to do
so. Perhaps this consciousness, the continual consciousness 
of the spell upon her, made her cling to
him even the more. He petted and nursed her,
thinking that she would grow calm and become
like herself; but instead of that she seemed to become 
more acutely distressed every moment. It
was so&mdash;her love for him made her position the
more terrible. She said nothing, only lay in his
arms, white, breathing with difficulty, speechless
and dry-eyed. Always in her mind was the one
thought&mdash;the money. How was it to be got?

<!-- page 209 -->

With Rex's arms around her and his love so close,
yet he might have been at the other side of the
Atlantic for any good he could be to her. The
confidence between them was gone&mdash;shattered!
In reality they were as strangers, living lives so
different that neither could ever hope again to
understand the other.</p>

<p>At last she grew, to outward appearance, calmer;
and Rex left her for a little while to make his
toilet. He returned, fresh as a daisy, and had
breakfast brought to Margery's room, cajoling her
to take a little, while he made a genuine meal.
Margery lay and watched him and wondered at
moments which was the reality&mdash;this healthy,
wholesome figure of the daylight, or that uncanny
and evil one of the night. Could both be? So
strangely alike too!&mdash;it seemed incredible. But
it was only too true. The two images co-existed
in her brain like the types of good and evil. Presently 
Rex began talking of what had kept him in
town. He had been signing settlements, and his
will, which, he explained to her, left everything
absolutely to herself and her heirs. Not a farthing

<!-- page 210 -->

to Oliver!&mdash;his only near relation. And then he
went on to say that it was chiefly Oliver who had
kept him in town. He said that Oliver was in
a worse scrape than ever and would soon be
"chucked" by his own set at the pace he was
going. Some of his creditors had been led to believe 
that it was he who was to marry Margery,
and that his debts would be paid on his marriage;
but that was a trifling circumstance compared to
the debts of honor he had contracted in the frantic
endeavor to right himself.</p>

<p>"He's been trying to get over me in every conceivable 
way," said Rex, "personally, through
the solicitors, even through mutual friends. But
to hand over two or three thousand pounds to a
hopeless gambler would be altogether too idiotic.
It wouldn't do him a particle of good. I'm sorry
for him; he'll soon have every front door shut on
him. But it's his own fault. There, I won't
talk of him any more. I don't know why I should
trouble you about it, when you're so ill. Why,
you are whiter than ever!"</p>

<p>Margery was afraid to be alone for a moment,

<!-- page 211 -->

and would not let Rex leave her. She was in a
state of hopeless procrastination, unable to decide
how to act, unable to invent any plan. She could
not endure her distress of mind unless she had Rex
by her side, holding her hand, giving her the sense
of comfort by his presence. Late in the day, having 
gathered a little courage, she told him of her
hurried journey to town, of her having taken the
diamonds from the bank to her jewellers. She
told him it was because she wanted some money
for herself in a hurry, more money than she had
at her own account; that she had intended to
borrow on them, but had been advised not to
do so.</p>

<p>Having started on this story she was obliged to
be circumstantial. She told him her idea was to
borrow the money till she could sell one of her
own farms and replace it. Her dread was that if
she ceased speaking he would ask her a question
she would not be able to answer without hesitation, 
and so she went on with her tale, trying to
disarm him of all points. She said she lost the
money in a foolish speculation, and begged him

<!-- page 212 -->

not to ask her any questions, because she was
worried over it and did not want to have to go
into it.</p>

<p>"So this is what made you so ill!" said Rex.
"Well, you are rich enough to indulge in foolish
speculations; but still, this is rather a large order.
However, if you would really rather not talk
about it I won't bother you at present. Only I
hope to Heaven <i>you</i> haven't taken to gambling.
Forgive me, dear, I didn't mean anything; but
you know stock exchange speculation is simply
gambling under another name; and I suppose that
is where you're money's gone. Now, do you
want me to get the money for you? Shall I write
to town now? I must have you look yourself
again at any cost! But, Madge, be a sensible
girl and tell me all about it, and let me settle it
all for you."</p>

<p>"Don't ask me!" she said.</p>

<p>"All right," answered Rex. Be it remembered,
it was still their honeymoon.</p>

<p>And so it was settled. He wrote to her solicitors, 
and Margery, worn out by the mental excitement, 

<!-- page 213 -->

fell off into a sudden sleep of exhaustion.
Rex took the opportunity to go out of the room
for a little while, and haying written his letter
took it to the post himself.</p>

<p>Margery imagined that she had made herself
safe at all points. She would not have felt it
necessary to tell Rex of her journey to London
but for the servants. She thought now she had
dealt with everything they knew. She forgot that
servants always know everything, and generally a
great deal more than has ever happened. At all
events they are to be trusted to know all that has
happened. Margery supposed that no one had
seen Oliver come or go. But the cook, an observant 
lady, had been looking out of a side window
when he arrived; had taken him for Rex, and was
much surprised at his absence later on. She was
anxious to get at the bottom of this mystery, so
she managed to waylay Rex on his return from the
post, in order to express her deep sympathy with
Mrs. Heriot, and to ask if she could not do something 
for her.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you must have thought us very

<!-- page 214 -->

neglectful, sir, to let the mistress be downstairs
ill all night; but we none of us knew she was ill.
But she's never been the same, sir, since that afternoon 
you came back so sudden and went away
again so soon&mdash;you'll remember, sir, three days
ago. She has been upset ever since."</p>

<p>"What on earth are you talking about?" said
Rex staring at the woman in unfeigned amazement.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said the woman coughing apologetically, 
"I saw you come in myself or else perhaps 
none of us would have known it."</p>

<p>"Saw me come in?" repeated Rex, in a profound 
surprise. "Well, just tell me what you
did see."</p>

<p>She explained to him how she was looking out
of a side-window and saw him walking over the
sand to the house; how Margery had come to
meet him and they had gone into the drawing-room 
and talked for some time, and then he had
gone away back to the station. "And very much
surprised I was, sir," said she, "for I was just
going off myself to get in the things for your
dinner."</p>

<!-- page 215 -->

<p>"Thanks," said Rex rather absently. "Well&mdash;that's 
all right. I was surprised at your amount
of information, that was all, not having seen any of
the servants myself."</p>

<p>He walked a little away from the house as if to
get more air; and then stood still suddenly and
uttered one word aloud&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oliver!"</p>

<p>He stood like a statue, thinking. There was
only one possible conclusion to draw. Oliver had
spoken very significantly to him before he went to
live at Hawthorndene, on that day when they met
in the harness room at Heriot Hall. Every word
of Oliver's came back to his mind now. No doubt
he had been supplanted in Margery's heart. There
could be no other explanation.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 216 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER XVII.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> hour later Rex went into the house again,
and went slowly up the stairs to Margery's room.
She was asleep. He stood and looked at her a
moment, and then sat wearily down in a chair
near her.</p>

<p>"She seemed to love me so well!" he said to
himself. "What an actress! How wicked women
are."</p>

<p>He did not form any plan of action except that
he intended to spare her. His was not a vindictive
jealousy, but a suffering one. The conviction
that the happiness of his life was gone entered
into him like a deep wound. So far as Margery
was concerned, pain and grief were the only feelings
he was conscious of.</p>

<p>Now and again a flash of bitterness lit up his
soul; it was when, in the weary revolution of
thought, the image of Oliver came before his

<!-- page 217 -->

mental vision. A spasm of hatred and rage passed
through him then which, when it had gone, filled
him with horror. It was unlike anything he had
hitherto experienced. True, the Heriot temper
lurked deep down in him somewhere; once or
twice in his life he had been carried away by
blind fury. It was always in self-defence. The
evil in him was not active. When once it was
roused it was terrible, and terrified even himself.
He felt he could kill Oliver. When he thought of
him, his hands opened and closed again as they lay
on his knees. There is no hatred like that between
blood relations when once it is roused. And
these two were so near&mdash;and so like!&mdash;so terribly
like when the same side of the character predominated. 
That likeness, that nearness, made the
hatred so much more horribly intense.</p>

<p>That Margery loved him! was ready to sacrifice
herself for him!&mdash;It seemed to Rex it would have
been so much easier to bear this if the man her
heart had gone to had been utterly unlike him,
his opposite, instead of this man he despised so,
yet who was so near and so like himself. Of

<!-- page 218 -->

course we always think if a pain were different
from what it actually happens to be, it would be
easier to bear. To Rex, however, the position he
was in seemed unique in its hatefulness.</p>

<p>Oliver was like him; yes, so like him as to be
mistaken for him. But he was the worst side, the
ugly side, of himself&mdash;a side so ugly that he hated
and despised it.</p>

<p>But Margery preferred it. She loved it as she
could not love himself. Probably the comfort she
found in his presence, the clinging that seemed so
like love, was merely because of his likeness to
Oliver!</p>

<p>No doubt she had loved Oliver long ago, before
Rex came back from California. She had accepted
himself because he was the heir; Oliver had
probably driven her into the marriage in order
that she should be able to supply him with funds.</p>

<p>Was Oliver actually her lover?</p>

<p>Oh, the awful pangs of jealousy! The mental
and physical agony! Rex had never tasted them
till that moment. Poor Margery had already
suffered them out to the bitter end for him. But

<!-- page 219 -->

he experienced them as something new, something
unexpected, horrible, undeserved, almost unimaginable. 
But true!&mdash;Yes, true. His head drooped
as the bitterness of it entered his soul.</p>

<p>Hitherto he had always been able to hold his
head high. He had been the favorite son, the
trusted one, the honest steward, the one his father
had leaned on, the one Margery had preferred.</p>

<p>And now that he felt she no longer preferred
him all that pride which had been his pleasure was
gone at one blow. He had not guessed till now
how much he cared for her, how absolutely she
was the centre of his life. His pride was wounded
in its tenderest place. Nowhere else could he have
been hurt so sorely. He had loved her so well, so
utterly, in such confidence! And all the while
she had been deceiving him, marrying him only
for money, preferring this scoundrel to himself.
His hands opened and closed again.</p>

<p>Then came the revulsion&mdash;the reaction.</p>

<p>Could there be any mistake? Had she done it
out of pity? Perhaps she could explain it all to
him very simply if he asked her to.</p>

<!-- page 220 -->

<p>He leaned forward and looked at her again.
She slept deeply and quietly, from profound exhaustion. 
There were deep marks of suffering on
her face which, as Rex studied them, seemed to
him new. At all events they had never been so
deep before. What was there that could make
her suffer, except her own guilt? Nothing.
There could be nothing else.</p>

<p>It was not too late yet to send a telegram to
Margery's solicitors, countermanding the orders
given in his letter. The idea of doing this came
to him with a sense of relief. He would spare her
as well as he could, but he would punish the
scoundrel who had stolen her love from him. He
would protect her from the consequences of her
foolish love, despite herself.</p>

<p>Fired by this sudden thought, he hastily went
out of the room, out of the house, and walked to
the post-office. In a few minutes he had framed
and sent a message.</p>

<p>This relieved him. He told himself he was
relieved because he had served Margery's interests.
But underneath this superficial feeling was a keen

<!-- page 221 -->

glow of satisfaction at having frustrated Oliver's
plans.</p>

<p>That night, and the next day, seemed very
strange to these two. Margery was timid, anxious,
silent, Rex was absorbed and absent; he kept
away from her as much as possible. Margery
imagined he was annoyed with her for her secrecy.
This she had expected; she was not surprised, but
took it as a deserved punishment. She was
helpless, powerless; she had no will to save herself
from this punishment. All she could do was to
bear it patiently. There were none of the accustomed 
smiles on her face; its bright vivacity was
gone. A haggardness had fallen upon it, and the
drawn lines showed the sharpness of her suffering.
The terrible thing to her was that Rex's absenting 
himself from her so much seemed to throw her
back upon Oliver; that dreaded shade was always
at her side, terrifying her, controlling her will,
controlling her thoughts. When Rex held her
hand in his she lost this terror for the moment
through the sheer comfort of wholesome human
companionship. But now this comfort was

<!-- page 222 -->

denied her; and she was too humble to ask
for it.</p>

<p>Two days passed like this. Rex never referred
to the subject of the money again, nor did Margery; 
she had not the courage to. But she grew
more and more uneasy at Rex's silence. What
did it mean? What had he done? Why had he
not received an answer from the solicitors and
spoken of it to her, as a matter of course?</p>

<p>At last driven by the controlling force that was
upon her she asked him what he had done.</p>

<p>"Countermanded the order," he said briefly.
"Second thoughts are best; you are able to give
your own orders, and I can't do anything for you
in a matter about which you won't give me your
confidence."</p>

<p>She sank back in her chair, her eyes wide open,
and fixed upon him.</p>

<p>What should she do?</p>

<p>Of course she could write herself, realize
upon some of her own property, and hand the
money over to Oliver. That was easily done now;
but by doing it, without explanation, she destroyed 

<!-- page 223 -->

the confidence between them, and their
happiness together, forever and ever.</p>

<p>She saw that very plainly. She was unable to
free her will from the control upon it; but where
Rex was concerned her intelligence could not be
blinded absolutely. She was sacrificing her whole
life. The horrible consciousness of this paralyzed
her, as she sat silently looking at her husband.
He had turned away from her, and was lighting a
cigar. When it was lit he went out.</p>

<p>No caress, no look&mdash;a blank. Well, it was
deserved. She cowered before this consciousness.
A good woman, suffering a punishment she believes
to be deserved, suffers as nothing else can that lives.
For in her there is the innate sense of rectitude
highly developed; and it is cultivated by tradition
and training to the utmost point. There is no
half-way house for a noble woman; no mode of
excuse which will serve her as an aid in the hour
of darkness. She has been taught the pure code
of ethics, which is considered unnecessary for
men; nobility and truth in all things. God help
her if she fails in any particular!</p>

<!-- page 224 -->

<p>Margery had failed. She knew it. Her punishment 
was already upon her in that knowledge.
How it hurt! Rex, for whom she would have
given her heart's blood, knew that she had some
secret she dared not tell him! She recognized
that he probably thought it would be much worse
than it was. But never for one second, never
during one flash of thought did she guess what
he did think.</p>

<p>She was more stupefied by the sense of her own
impotence than anything else. Her will was so
crushed&mdash;she was in a state of such mortal terror
that she had no idea how to act.</p>

<p>Surely if she gave Oliver all he wanted he would
cease to trouble her, and she would begin to repair
her errors! She would never put herself in his
power again. She would recover her strength
and defy him. Her native courage gave her this
hope.</p>

<p>Alas, poor Margery! How little does the ordinary 
world know of the mysterious powers which
rule its life. She did not realize that her strength
and her courage were no longer her own, but

<!-- page 225 -->

belonged to the man who controlled them. They
existed for him, and for his purposes.</p>

<p>Sitting in her chair, she sat turning over in her
mind what she could do. She planned a letter to
her solicitors, and looked across the room at her
writing-table. But she had no volition which
would enable her to go to it. The table seemed
to be miles off, and her limbs made of adamant.</p>

<p>Why was this so? She did not know; she
imagined she must be exhausted, ill, tired out.
But in reality her will was subservient to another
will. She was not in a condition to control her
own body. She had to wait for orders which
must emanate from another brain.</p>

<p>It seemed as if at last the order came. She got
up and moved across to the table, sat down and
took the pen in her hand. An unutterable horror
came upon her at the same moment&mdash;a sense that
some one was standing by her side, controlling
her. Could it be so? She laid her pen down&mdash;but 
instantly took it up again. She commenced
a letter, filling in the date very carefully.</p>

<p>While she was writing it, and writing in a half

<!-- page 226 -->

consciousness, scarcely thinking of what she was
doing, Rex came in at the door. He went up to
her and looked over her shoulder. She started
back violently, but already he had seen what was
written.</p>

<p>"What!" he said, "four thousand of your
money for that spendthrift devil! Not exactly.
Why, it was only two thousand last night! At this
rate you will give him all you possess in a week.
No, Margery, you shall not do it. I am your husband, 
and I will save you."</p>

<p>He snatched the letter from the table and flung
it in the fire. In a second it had vanished. Margery 
looked at him with wide eyes and parted lips.
She said nothing.</p>

<p>A frightful impulse had come upon her, when
he did this, that froze the blood in her veins and
paralyzed every feeling in her body, every thought
in her brain. It was&mdash;</p>

<p>"Kill him! Kill him!"</p>

<p>Kill him! Her darling, the love of her life, the
being she lived for,&mdash;Rex! Kill him! Why?
What for? Why should she kill him? She

<!-- page 227 -->

could not tell, but she believed she had to do it.
Suddenly this vista of horror opened itself before
her and she saw she had to walk down it. In
thought&mdash;yes, only in thought, of course&mdash;no one,
no power could make her do it in reality. But
why should she be compelled even to think of it?
To face the horror for a second? Why? She
protested wildly within herself, even while the
thought remained written as it were in her brain.</p>

<p>Her Rex! What a horrible thought, that of
seeing him dead! Her Rex, whom she loved so
dearly!</p>

<p>She steadied herself and rose from the table. It
was impossible even to look at this man whom she
loved so dearly with this criminal, cruel feeling
upon her!</p>

<p>Presently this passed off a little. The impression 
faded from her mind, the agony of her brain
lessened. She turned and looked at him.</p>

<p>He was standing by the fire, smoking a cigar
caught viciously between his teeth. If she had
seen him then she would have known that he
looked now as he had looked when he was talking

<!-- page 228 -->

to Oliver in the harness-room at Heriot Hall, long
since; on that day when Oliver told him he intended 
to go and live at Hawthorndene, and warned
him of the results.</p>

<p>It was the same look now: weary, disgusted.</p>

<p>It was new to Margery; something she had
never seen before.</p>

<p>To Rex it was as if Margery was not present;
as if he had to deal with Oliver. Disgust and
anger entirely blotted out the affection and tenderness 
which were strong in him for Margery.</p>

<p>But as Margery recovered herself a little, so did
he. As she returned to her natural feeling, so he
became drawn towards her by them.</p>

<p>A sudden impulse took her across the room to
him, her hands stretched out.</p>

<p>"Rex," she said, "forgive me. Oh, if you
knew how I love you! Forgive me the past, and
the future. Whatever has happened, whatever
may happen! forgive me, for I love you!"</p>

<p>Never had she looked more beautiful than in
this sudden moment of love which came in the
midst of her misery; never had her voice sounded

<!-- page 229 -->

so seductive. He caught her to him and kissed
her passionately, all the weariness and disgust
fading quickly from his face.</p>

<p>In this glad moment Oliver was utterly forgotten. 
To each of them it was as if he had
never lived.</p>

<p>It is this oblivion which makes the supreme
pleasure of love. For a little while the waters of
Lethe wash over the soul, leaving it cleaned and
refreshed almost as though new-born.</p>

<p>The incident of the letter was not mentioned
between them. Rex took it as a concluded episode; 
he believed her heart had rushed back to him
again. And he was too happy in the reconciliation 
to analyze further. To Margery it seemed as
if the first joy of her honeymoon had come back.
She knew it would go again&mdash;that this reprieve
was only for a moment, and the knowledge of
this made her cling to it the more desperately
while she had it.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 230 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER XVIII.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning when Margery opened her
eyes in the daylight it seemed to her that she had
escaped from a terrible nightmare&mdash;that she was
emerging from it. She felt tired, faded, worn, as
though years had passed over her head in the last
few days; but she fancied she was free again and
safe in the love between Rex and herself.</p>

<p>But this was only the lull before the crisis of
the storm. On that day came the hardest struggle
she had yet encountered.</p>

<p>After breakfast Rex went out, but she stayed
at home alone, for she felt exhausted and disinclined 
for any exertion. She sat by the fire in
the drawing-room and opened a novel, without,
however, being able to keep her attention on it for
more than a few minutes. She never turned a
page, for before she had read to the bottom of the
first one the book fell into her lap and her head
fell back on the cushions she was leaning against.

<!-- page 231 -->

It appeared to her that a voice close beside her
said loudly and distinctly "Sleep!"</p>

<p>The wave of drowsiness swept over her so suddenly 
and deeply that it was as if she had fallen
into a stupor. And then her lips began to move
and broken sentences to come from them. She
was answering an invisible question.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I have not done it&mdash;I have left it&mdash;Rex
told me to&mdash;I have done as he told me&mdash;I cannot
do as you told me&mdash;It would displease him&mdash;It
would make him angry&mdash;I cannot do it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The stupor became more profound, and her whole
body took on an appearance of inertness that was
like death. Her lips ceased to move; she fell into
a depth of unconsciousness in which it was impossible 
for her body to record or recognize. It was
as if her spirit had actually left her body. For
quite a long time she remained like this; then
faint signs of returning life appeared. She began
instantly to cry out, as if she were engaged in a
desperate battle of words with someone, "I cannot&mdash;I 
will not! It is impossible!&mdash;I cannot."</p>

<p>Suddenly she opened her eyes, and looked round

<!-- page 232 -->

the room in utter bewilderment. By degrees she
began to realize where she was.</p>

<p>"How awful," she said in a low voice of horror,
to herself. "How absolutely awful!"</p>

<p>She sat as if paralyzed by some frightful vision
that was before her eyes; sat as if turned to stone,
until she heard Rex's step at the doorway. Then
she started up and escaped from the room, rushing
past him and away upstairs. Rex looked after her
in amazement; then slowly followed her. The
door of her room was locked, and she would not
answer him. He turned and went downstairs
again, a heavy gloom on his face.</p>

<p>"Some new development!" he thought to
himself. And their happiness which seemed to
have returned appeared to him to have taken wing
for good and all. The recurrent mysteries must
kill it out, so he thought, sadly.</p>

<p>He went into the drawing-room and sat down in
a deep chair, in his favorite lounging attitude, and
fell to staring into the fire. His thoughts were
not very clearly formed, but they were very
painful.</p>

<!-- page 233 -->

<p>After some time he heard Margery's footstep
on the stairs. She came down very slowly. She
walked into the room with a singular reluctant air,
as if she was forcing herself into his presence by a
sheer effort of will. She came near the fire, but
stood with her head turned away, looking out of
the window.</p>

<p>"Rex," she said, "I've a fancy to go home. Do
you mind?"</p>

<p>He started with surprise. Sitting forward in
his chair he looked at her very earnestly.</p>

<p>"When do you want to go?" he asked at
last.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said, with a sort of desperate sigh,
"at once if it were possible. Something terrible
will happen if I don't!"</p>

<p>"What, to-day?&mdash;now?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered.</p>

<p>He again paused a moment or two before speaking, 
then he said, very sadly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I suppose it is of no use asking you to explain
this to me. I conclude that scoundrel has communicated 
with you in some way while I have

<!-- page 234 -->

been gone. Has he been here?" with sudden rage;
"can I find him anywhere?"</p>

<p>"No," she said stonily, "he has not been here;"
and the very iciness of her manner carried conviction 
with it. The rage died away as suddenly
as it came, and utter sadness took its place
again.</p>

<p>"I am ready," he said dully. "Perhaps you will
speak to your father, if you will not to me. You
must speak to someone. I'll give the orders at
once."</p>

<p>Rex was an accustomed traveller, and one of the
practical kind, ready for forced marches or any
emergency. He made no trouble about a hasty
return, but simply went out and sent two telegrams,
one to the housekeeper at Heriot Hall, and one to
Sir Charles. He was glad of the idea of returning,
for something in Margery's manner had thoroughly
alarmed him.</p>

<p>She avoided him all the rest of the time, making
the preparations an excuse for keeping out of his
way. When she had to be with him she never
looked him in the face, and preserved an impenetrable 

<!-- page 235 -->

stoniness of manner except for an occasional
spasm of extreme nervousness. It was as if she had
been changed into another person.</p>

<p>"Something awful must have happened," thought
Rex, over and over again; "what has that brute
threatened, to terrify her so?"</p>

<p>If he could but dimly have guessed the truth!
If he could have imagined that she was in the state
in which a faithful dog is when madness is coming
upon it, and its love makes it run from its master
lest it should bite him.</p>

<p>"Kill him!&mdash;kill him,"&mdash;these dreadful words
filled her mind, and an insane desire to spring at
him&mdash;to strangle him&mdash;came upon her whenever
she was near him.</p>

<p>She was afraid to be alone with him, lest she
should do some terrible thing. Her one sane idea
was to get home, to be near friends who would
protect her from herself or from whatever it was
that was controlling and possessing herself, and be
able to speak to someone. She did not yet know
who she could speak to, but she knew it would
help her only to have the possibility within reach.</p>

<!-- page 236 -->

<p>In her stupor a vision had been shown to her.
<i>She had seen herself taking the life of the man she
loved in his sleep</i>.</p>

<p>Was it possible she could be made to do a horrible
crime without knowing she did it, as she had done
lesser things? The idea that this might be possible
haunted and terrified her. Worse still, she was
conscious of the growing desire <i>to do it</i>. It was
as if two beings were in her body, contending
furiously, dragging her hither and thither, first
one way and then the other. It was an awful condition 
and she felt that it would be impossible to
maintain it; in time she must yield!</p>

<p>Late that night they got home to Heriot Hall.
As much preparation as could be made in so short
a time had been made. There was a bright fire,
some supper, and best of all, Sir Charles waiting
for them. He was so delighted to see Margery
again that he noticed little; and helped by his
bluff heartiness, Margery managed to put on something 
of her ordinary manner. She made him tell
her about everything and everybody, and sit over
the supper-table late into the night. Her one

<!-- page 237 -->

horror was the idea of being left alone with Rex;
and she turned over all sorts of wild expedients in
her mind. Could she insist on going home with
her father, representing it as a mere mad-brained
freak? No, that was impossible; it would puzzle
him too much and wound Rex too deeply. Besides, 
it grew so late that Rex insisted on Sir
Charles staying; and he agreed readily enough.
After all, that was something. Sir Charles liked
sitting up, and she could sit and talk to him till
she fell asleep in her chair. Rex let her do as she
liked, observing her feverish efforts at conversation 
with anxiety and dismay.</p>

<p>The one person who was mentioned by none of
the three was Oliver. His name seemed to be
avoided by mutual consent. At last, however, Sir
Charles spoke of him inadvertently. He was talking 
of his favorite subject, his horses. "Graybeard's 
dead lame," he said; "I hope they'll look
after him; Oliver's no good&mdash;in fact 'twas Oliver
lamed him this very afternoon, damn him. I beg
your pardon, Rex, I hadn't meant to mention the
matter, but it slipped out."</p>

<!-- page 238 -->

<p>"Oliver lamed him!" said Rex in surprise,
"but he's a good rider."</p>

<p>"When he's sober he is," said Sir Charles in a
tone of deep disgust, "but he was drunk this afternoon 
and half mad. I never saw him in such a
state before. How the men could let him go out
on the horse I can't think."</p>

<p>Rex said nothing in answer to this. Margery
sat listening with a blanched face.</p>

<p>"You're tired, child," said Sir Charles, noticing
her pallor, "why don't you go to bed?"</p>

<p>"I will directly," she said, "but I want to hear
about Oliver. I never knew him to drink like that."</p>

<p>Rex looked up surprised at the coolness of her
tone, and scrutinized her keenly. "What an actress
she is!" he again thought to himself In wonder.
Was it possible for a woman to speak in such an
indifferent tone of the man who controlled her
heart and her affections? That was what Rex
asked himself in a profound amazement. How
impossible it was to know people, he reflected;
how utterly different Margery was from what he
had always believed her to be.</p>

<!-- page 239 -->

<p>"Oh, there's nothing more to tell you," said Sir
Charles, trying to pass over the subject lightly.
"I didn't intend to refer to it this first night I've
got you back, but I'll own I've been uneasy about
the boy lately. He's been very strange, as if he'd
something on his mind; I suppose it's these money
difficulties of his. But the last two days he has
been like a wild creature, as queer as possible, and
mad drunk by the evening. I declare he has put
me in mind of a man who has committed a
murder or means to, and who's not able to think
of anything else."</p>

<p>Rex got up and went across to Margery.
"She has fainted," he said.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 240 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER XIX.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neither</span> Sir Charles nor Rex went to bed that
night at all, for Margery was very ill and they
were too anxious to leave her. They hovered
about her room till the morning came, watching
and waiting.</p>

<p>In the daylight she looked pale and wan, like
some stricken creature. She had no power to
rouse herself, or move from where she lay; she
was full of dread of the next attack that would
come upon her, when she would again he possessed
by this horrible madness. For that was what it
seemed to her to be when she thought of it in
calmer moments. She was calm now, but utterly
exhausted.</p>

<p>Her craving was never to be alone; and her
ceaseless desire was to speak out to someone. It
was impossible to speak to her father, she found,
when she tried to. He was of so utterly prosaic a

<!-- page 241 -->

temperament that she felt he would never understand 
anything she attempted to tell him, and
the words died on her lips as they were formed.</p>

<p>Who was there? It is only when real trouble
comes that we realize fully how few friends we
have. For a friend must not only be willing, but
sympathetic and, above all, intelligent. When
all these things are required it is quite wonderful
how the list of one's friends narrows down.</p>

<p>Who was there? Suddenly the memory of a
fresh, sweet, honest face came before her. Hetty!</p>

<p>She raised herself directly, and begged Rex to
let her write a note and to send a carriage with it.</p>

<p>"I know she will come," she said, "I am sure
she will come."</p>

<p>"What's made you take such a sudden fancy?"
asked Sir Charles.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Margery wearily. "But
I think she'll make me feel better, she is so
bright."</p>

<p>It is strange how in deep and awful trouble the
longing for someone's face, the craving for one
particular human presence, sets in, and nothing

<!-- page 242 -->

else seems to relieve the pain. So it was with
Margery now. She longed for the sight of Hetty
Carruthers' fresh face as in a fever one longs for
water. And when Hetty came she appeared to
bring a new atmosphere into the room&mdash;something
bright and fresh like a sea-breeze.</p>

<p>"Why, you're sick!" she said. "That's too
bad. I'm so glad I was home and could just come
right away. Well, what's wrong that you look so
strange, anyway?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Margery. "Come
and sit near if you don't mind, and let me look at
you. You seem so fresh."</p>

<p>"Why surely! But say, 'taint encouraging to
look at you, anyhow, you ain't happy. I'm certain 
of it, just as sure as I'm alive."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not," said Margery seeing it was
useless to fence with such a direct and positive
person.</p>

<p>"I guess I oughtn't to speak out so straight,
but tain't in me to go into things elegant. I
wish you didn't seem so white. What's wrong,
anyway. Will ye speak?"</p>

<!-- page 243 -->

<p>"Not yet," said Margery, "talk to me about
yourself and all you have been doing."</p>

<p>Of course, led on by degrees, Hetty very soon
began to talk about Oliver. She worshipped him,
and could neither see or imagine any flaw in her idol.
As she talked on, Margery grew more and more
silent, thinking deeply and hopelessly. It was
terrible to her to find this girl's pure heart had
gone out so completely in such a direction. What
could be done? What would be the end of it?
She was oppressed by the anxious thoughts that
crowded in upon her, and hardly listened to much
of Hetty's quaint talk. That young lady soon
found this out and tried a new mode of distraction.</p>

<p>"&nbsp;'Tis such a lovely day," she said, "do get up
and come out. I know ye feel sick, and as if you'd
lie just there till the end of time. But you'll feel
real set up if you'll come out in the air. Do now&mdash;to 
please me."</p>

<p>Who could resist that lovely flushed face and
those soft dark blue eyes! No one who had either
a sense of lovableness or a sense of loveliness.

<!-- page 244 -->

Hetty appealed to both, and Margery possessed
both strongly. It was a deep pleasure to her to
feel the soft touch of those kind arms about her,
the contact of Hetty's sweet face against her own.
It rested and refreshed her. She felt as if it were
possible to rouse herself in order to please this
beautiful creature. And so, before long, these
two came out upon the terrace in front of the
Hall and walked up and down in the sun, arm in
arm. Margery began to feel as if she had really
escaped from the nightmare she had passed through,
and the two were talking together with a gayety
which seemed as natural to one as to the other&mdash;when 
suddenly the whole world changed to them
both. To one it was as if a light from Heaven
came; to the other a blackness as of hell.</p>

<p>A man on horseback was riding up the avenue,
and the two girls recognized him at the same moment 
with these opposite feelings.</p>

<p>It was Oliver Heriot. He rode up to the Hall
door; a servant came out for his horse, and in a
moment he was by Margery's side. She scarcely
spoke to him; she would not raise her eyes. She

<!-- page 245 -->

was filled with a horror and terror she was
ashamed of. Hetty talked for both, and seemed as
gay as possible. She was troubled, nevertheless,
by Margery's unexpected coldness and silence, and
also by something which puzzled even her love-blinded 
eyes about Oliver. He had the look, unmistakable 
to anyone who has seen it once before, 
of the man who has shaken his nerve with
heavy drinking over night, and has "pulled himself 
together" in the morning with some difficulty. 
To Hetty it seemed as if he were ill, or
affected strangely by some trouble that weighed
upon his mind. Margery, however, was not at all
deceived, and her disgust deepened momently. And
this disgust produced a curious result; her own
natural strength partly returned to her, and her fear
of him died away. She raised her eyes at last and
looked him full in the face, and when her eyes
met his, his fell first. What elasticity and hope
came to her as she realized this! It was a joy
like that of one who might hope to be born
again.</p>

<p>But this only lasted a little while, for Oliver

<!-- page 246 -->

was rapidly becoming more himself with the
healthful effects of the ride and the fresh air, and
the sense of the necessity for action. He saw
that Margery was escaping from him, and he
cursed himself for haying destroyed his power so
foolishly.</p>

<p>He resolved in future to bear the pangs of
conscience rather than take an oblivion which cost
so dear. Resolutions of this kind are usually
registered with great fervor; but the cause which
destroys the original rectitude is powerful enough
to destroy the repentant one. This is a fact which
was as yet unknown to Oliver, and had to be ascertained 
by experience. At the moment he felt
capable of bringing back all his original manhood
and its power.</p>

<p>The gong sounded for lunch, and the three went
into the house together. Sir Charles and Rex
were in the dining-room. The meeting between
the brothers was extremely cold, and the situation
threatened to be very embarrassing, and would
have been so but for Sir Charles, who came to the
rescue with a flood of cheerful small-talk. He

<!-- page 247 -->

and Hetty were great friends, and they managed
to keep the ball going. She did her best, and was
delightful. Nevertheless she was very uneasy, for
she became more and more definitely conscious
that there was something wrong. Rex was the
only one who actually made no effort to appear at
ease. He sat gloomily at the table, but eat nothing. 
Oliver, on the contrary, simulated his natural
manner with great success. His whole attention
was in reality given to recovering his power over
Margery; and he thought little and cared less
about the way his brother received him, or whether
he was welcome in the house or no.</p>

<p>Immediately lunch was over Rex left the
others and disappeared. Margery went into the
library, where a large fire was burning, and sat
down in a low chair beside it. She scarcely noticed 
whether the others followed her. A deep
stupor was settling in upon her, which she struggled 
against in vain. She felt it was Oliver's
presence which caused it, and she would have
given worlds to have had the courage and resolution 
to tell him to leave the house. But during

<!-- page 248 -->

lunch, while she had sat opposite him, his eyes
upon her, all her courage and resolution had faded.
His supremacy was complete for the moment, and
it was as useless for her to make any effort against
it as it is useless to struggle in the horrors of a
nightmare.</p>

<p>She did not hear or notice what was said, or
what was going on around her, though the others
had all followed her and grouped themselves about
the fire. They formed a very merry party, too;
whether the gayety was natural or imposed, nevertheless 
it was there. And yet everyone was full
of a strange uneasiness which each fancied was all
his or her own. Oliver's aim was by some means
or other to get Margery alone, and he was determined 
not to leave her till he had done so, and
had made the impression on her mind that he
intended to make.</p>

<p>For now, in his present phase of feeling, all
remorse was gone from him, and he was conscious
of nothing but his hatred of Rex, and his resolution
to stand in his shoes. Sitting at the lunch-table
with him, had excited and intensified these feelings

<!-- page 249 -->

to the last degree. If Rex had found it possible
to address a friendly word to him, or, still more, to
hold out the least hope of help, this hatred between
them would never have reached so awful a pitch.
But Rex was smarting and suffering under a nonexistent 
wrong, and his sense of injury made the
situation hopeless and horrible.</p>

<p>Here in the old house, Oliver felt he ought to
be at home; he looked on Rex as an absolute
usurper because he had all. What was easier than
to get him out of the way? Everything was left
to Margery; with his power over her it would be
very easy to make her marry him. Whether she
liked or loathed him mattered nothing to him, so
long as she enabled him to step into Rex's shoes.
And he thought it over coolly, and decided on his
course of action even while he talked to Hetty,
and met her lovely eyes with the love in them
very ill concealed. For Hetty was too frank to be
able to hide anything, and Oliver knew that she
was his for the asking. But to him she only
amounted to a second string to his bow. He
devoted himself to keeping her in her present state

<!-- page 250 -->

of mind, as he thought she might be worth fighting
for if he failed in his great plan.</p>

<p>But he had no intention of failing in it. He
was in the confident humor, when all things are
not only possible but certain.</p>

<p>About four o'clock some visitors arrived; Mr.
and Mrs. Carruthers.</p>

<p>Margery dully and absently responded to Mrs.
Carruthers' affectionate and anxious inquiries
about her. She had all the appearance and manner
of one who is really ill, so that both she and
Oliver felt that the strange secret which existed
between them was perfectly safe.</p>

<p>Mr. Carruthers was a tall, dark, severe-looking
man, with the most perfect manners, and only a
faint reminder of the Yankee quaintness of speech
and tone which was so marked in Hetty. It was
hard to believe him to be her brother, they were
so different in appearance, until one came to talk
to him, and know him. Then the same generous
nature and honest spirit made themselves felt.
Business and its associations had dried out of him
the fresh raciness which made Hetty so charming; 

<!-- page 251 -->

but underneath, the nature was the same.
Margery felt this instinctively. She liked him at
once, and found it pleasant to talk to him even in
her dulled and abnormal state. His pride and
delight in his beautiful young wife made itself
visible immediately; he could not hide his strong
feelings any more than could Hetty. These two
were both born to love and worship and to suffer
everything from those they loved and worshipped.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Joseph Carruthers he had chosen
a woman who looked upon life as an art and who
certainly would not make him suffer if she could
possibly avoid it, for suffering appeared to her to
be un&aelig;sthetic.</p>

<p>The Carruthers stayed about an hour, and when
they went carried Hetty off with them. She would
have been left with Margery if Oliver had not been
there, but the Carruthers were much too well aware
of the state of her feelings to leave her, under the
circumstances. Oliver gave a sigh of relief when
they had gone. He looked at Sir Charles thoughtfully, 
considering how to get rid of him.</p>

<p>A silence came upon the little company, for

<!-- page 252 -->

Sir Charles was still too angry with Oliver to speak
civilly to him, except under social pressure; and
Margery felt it no longer necessary to exert herself.
It was a sort of luxury to yield herself up to the
stupor which hung over her, after fighting it for
so long.</p>

<p>Oliver planted himself in front of the fire and
showed no intention of moving. He considered
himself to be, at all events, more at home than Sir
Charles was, and he determined to stay him out.
That was his only course. He thought it might
serve, as he did not believe that Rex would come
into the room while he was there.</p>

<p>So it turned out: Sir Charles, annoyed by his
persistency, went off in rather a bad temper.</p>

<p>Oliver immediately turned to Margery. She
was already so much under his influence as to be
almost asleep, and it was only necessary for him
to raise his hand and look into her eyes to make
her pass into the deepest hypnotic trance.</p>

<p>"Do you understand?" he said, "you have to
kill him."</p>

<p>"I will not," she said, in a strange, sharp tone.</p>

<!-- page 253 -->

<p>"You will!" he commanded, and repeated it
several times.</p>

<p>"I cannot!" she said in the same tone, but more
faintly.</p>

<p>"<i>You can!</i>"</p>

<p>Her head fell on one side; she seemed to be
dead, so deep was the stupor he had flung her into.</p>

<p>"Go up to his dressing-room," he said, "and
change the position of the two little blue bottles
which stand just inside the door of the bureau.
Do you understand? Do you know them?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do you see them now?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You can now? You see the bureau?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Tell me if they are there. They always used
to be."</p>

<p>"Yes, they are there."</p>

<p>"Go up, the moment you wake, and change their
places. Put the one that is to the right to the left,
and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<!-- page 254 -->

<p>"Obey me, then. Wake!"</p>

<p>She was in so deep a trance that it seemed as if
he would never wake her. At last, however, she
was sufficiently roused to be able to move, and then
immediately got up from her chair and left the
room. Oliver watched her go, and went into the
hall to see her pass up the stairs. Then he turned
into the dining-room, which was empty, but very
pleasant and cheerful, with a bright fire, the table
laid ready for dinner and decorated with flowers.
He went to the sideboard, and took out a decanter.
He went over to the fire and stood by it, putting
the decanter on the mantelpiece and continually
filling a wineglass he held. His mind was in such
a fearful state that he had lost the ordinary use of
his senses, and positively did not know he was
drinking raw brandy.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="center">CHAPTER XX.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was about half-past six when Rex came out
of his study, where he had shut himself up all the
afternoon, and went up to his dressing-room.</p>

<p>It was one of his customs to be very punctual
in dressing for dinner, as he always took a dose of
medicine before it. Ever since his stay in California 
this had become a habit, as a slight fever he
had contracted there occasionally returned upon
him unless he took these precautions.</p>

<p>To-day he walked upstairs with his eyes upon
the ground, and his hands in his pockets, in the
attitude peculiar to an Englishman when despondent. 
Life seemed very dark, very hopeless to
him.</p>

<p>How strange fortune is! A young man with
every personal attribute necessary to make him
liked, with abundant fortune, and all the world

<!-- page 256 -->

before him, he felt like a criminal at the stake,
without hope.</p>

<p>He had never loved any woman but Margery.
He was one of those men who love but once and
love completely. To lose her meant losing all that
he understood as life or happiness. Money and
position were nothing without her. And the peculiar, 
intense sting always burned within him,
that it would have been easier to lose her to any
other man than the one who had stolen her.</p>

<p>His head drooped, he walked slowly to his room,
carrying out his mechanical habits without taking
any interest in them; his mind all the while set
on the darkness which lay before him.</p>

<p>He went into his dressing-room, closed the door,
and then, walking to the window, stood looking
out of it a little while. He gazed at the familiar
trees, and the lines of the park as they melted away
in the twilight, seeing them as old friends, which in
some faint way soothed the turmoil of his mind.
Here at least there was no change; while he lived
the trees and the park would all remain as they
were. They could not deceive or betray him.</p>

<!-- page 257 -->

<p>Presently he turned and crossed the room to his
bureau. Inside the upper door was a little ledge
on which stood a medicine case, with a little blue
bottle on each side of it. He took up the left one,
poured out a dose and raised it to his lips. Before
his lips touched it he was stupefied with amazement; 
two warm, soft arms were round his neck.
He had not heard a sound, and he could scarcely
believe his senses. The gas was burning low; he
put out his hand and turned it up full, setting
down the glass untasted in order to do this.</p>

<p>Margery was clinging to him like some desperate
creature, her face hidden, her arms locked round
him. He looked down at her in amazement. What
did this mean? He tried to unclasp her hands, but
in vain. For some minutes they stood like this, two
hearts beating in agony, and without any intelligence, 
one of the other.</p>

<p>At last she lifted her head slowly and showed
her face. He saw a face that he had never seen
before; it seemed like that of a stranger, so drawn
and white, and agony-stamped was it.</p>

<!-- page 258 -->

<p>"You have not drank it?" she said in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Drank what? The medicine?&mdash;No, I'm just
going to take it."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;don't touch it. Come away with me out
of this room. Come&mdash;please&mdash;yes, I insist! I
shall die here. O what I have suffered!"</p>

<p>She dragged him to the door, he so utterly perplexed 
that he knew not whether to resist her or
obey. He yielded, however, for she seemed frantic 
with anxiety to get out of the room. She held
fast to him till they were outside the door, which
she shut tight behind her.</p>

<p>"My God!" she exclaimed; "what a nightmare 
I have lived through! What a horror! But
it's over for some strange reason. Come with me,
Rex; I must find Oliver."</p>

<p>He followed her, perfectly puzzled, but saying
nothing, for it seemed useless to ask her questions,
in her excited, unnatural state. And yet, unnatural 
as her excitement was, there was something
more like the old Margery about her; and a faint
wild hope rose in his heart.</p>

<!-- page 259 -->

<p>They went downstairs, Margery leading the way.
She went into the library, looked round, and came
out again; then into the drawing-room. From
there she came out again into the hall, and met the
butler, who, when he saw her, turned back to shut
the dining-room door.</p>

<p>"Do you know where Mr. Oliver is?" she said.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, I don't," he answered, and looked
at Rex with a very odd expression. He remained
standing by the door he had shut.</p>

<p>"He's in there," said Margery suddenly; and
pushing past the man she opened the door and
went in.</p>

<p>Oliver sat in a chair by the fire, a straight dining-room 
chair. His head was propped against the
mantelpiece for he was quite unable to hold it up.</p>

<p>"Bring her away, sir, please," said the servant
to Rex. "Mr. Oliver has had a drop too much,
and he wouldn't like to be seen in such a state."</p>

<p>"Come away, Margery," said Rex.</p>

<p>But instead of obeying him she walked straight
up to Oliver and stood looking at him. Her figure
seemed taller, her air more confident, than it had

<!-- page 260 -->

ever been. The distress was vanishing from her
face, and triumph took its place by degrees. She
would not move, though Rex came and tried to
lead her away.</p>

<p>"No," she said. "I want to talk to you here,
and now. I want to tell you a story. Have
patience and listen to me. This man, who has
tried to curse my life and make of me a criminal,
and who very nearly succeeded!&mdash;Yes, very nearly
succeeded. This man is helpless now and idiotic
from his own folly, and I will use the opportunity.
I am myself, now that he is a beast; let me speak
while I have the power, and then you will know
all, and be able to save me. Oh, Rex, it is an evil
conscience that has driven him to this!"</p>

<p>Rex had sent the servant away when she began
to speak, and shut the door. They were alone.
Standing in front of Oliver, looking down upon
him, her hands clasped tight, as if to hold her excitement 
in check, Margery began at the beginning
and told him all the story that has been related
here, so far as she understood it and could tell it.</p>

<p>Rex listened, in momently deepening amazement,

<!-- page 261 -->

sometimes incredulous, actually not believing what
she said.</p>

<p>"I will give you my diary to read," she said at
last. "It is upstairs in my room; come with me
and leave this creature for the servants to take
care of."</p>

<p>She led the way again, and he followed her, so
perplexed as to have no word to say. In the hall
they found Sir Charles and the butler hovering
about.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" said Sir Charles. "Is it
Oliver?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rex, seizing the opportunity of
getting rid of him. "Do go and see what's to be
done. Perhaps the servants can get him up to his
old room, and we'll let him sleep it off there.
Margery wants me."</p>

<p>Margery had gone on upstairs, and Rex, having
said this, hastily followed her.</p>

<p>"Is it possible," he exclaimed, directly he
entered the room, "that all this misery has risen
out of your jealousy of Mrs. Carruthers! It doesn't
seem credible! Great Heavens! The mystery

<!-- page 262 -->

between us was nothing but this: I had seen her
in California, when she served drinks in a mining
saloon. She is the daughter of a convict. How
she got where she is I can't imagine, but she always
said it was by fair means, and begged me not to
let people know what she had been."</p>

<p>"But she had a hold over you," said Margery
in a very low voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, that!" answered Rex uneasily. "Well, I
had better explain everything, as this is a day of
explanations. I never wanted you to know it, for
I don't like thinking about it myself. There was a
row in the saloon she served in, one night, and I
shot a man&mdash;a man I liked too! But he was mad
with drink, and I had to do it, or die myself. She
knew very well I'm not the sort to like the incident
talked about at home here, where we're not accustomed 
to free fights. I'd almost succeeded
in forgetting it, till she revived the unpleasant
memory."</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 263 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER XXI.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frightened</span> at his own thoughts, Oliver had
been drowning them steadily all the afternoon,
till he had finally drowned his intelligence altogether. 
The effects of the last few days were on
him still, and as a matter of fact the hour or two
in which he had recovered his influence over Margery 
were only a rift in the cloud. She was certain 
of her deliverance if she could only have
known it. The agonies of conscience which he
suffered made life unendurable to him unless he
deadened them; the horrible idea of the future
punishment which he firmly believed he was laying 
up for himself, came like the sharp sting of a
physical pain the moment the necessity for action
ceased. Then he must deaden his terror, and took
any possible mode of doing so. He had adopted
a very simple mode of effecting what he wanted,
and had done it in such a manner that he did not

<!-- page 264 -->

believe any person could ever be blamed for it.
Rex Heriot would be dead from a purely accidental 
cause, having taken a dose of carbolic acid by
mistake for his usual medicine. How simple and
easy it was! If it should fail, if Margery should
have fallen into the hypnotic sleep again, and not
carried out her orders, or if she should struggle
against them and delay, he felt quite safe, because
he was convinced his power over her was strong
enough to keep her under his control, and prevent
her speaking to anyone but himself. He had been
so successful in keeping her under control hitherto
that he never doubted his power for a moment;
and went on pouring brandy down his throat to
keep up his courage and keep off the horrors, forgetting, 
or never guessing, that he was destroying
his will power absolutely. As his courage increased, 
his confidence of success became greater,
until at last he began to listen every moment for
the alarm through the house which would mean
that Rex had drunk the fatal draught. Each
time he thought of this the first feeling was exultation, 
and he told himself how he would step into

<!-- page 265 -->

his brother's shoes and have his turn at the good
things of earth. But each time this exultation
was followed by a fit of horror, and he went again
to the only remedy he knew of. Thus, by the time
Margery came into the room he was in a state of
quarrelsome stupor, and only demanded fiercely to
be let alone when anyone wished him to move. He
stared stupidly at her in a senseless amazement,
while she talked to Rex. Right in Oliver's presence 
she told everything, and he had so destroyed
his brains that he had not the power to interfere.
But it slowly entered his dulled mind that this had
happened; and when Sir Charles came into the
room he was just struggling to his feet.</p>

<p>"I'll go," he was saying thickly; "she's played
the devil with me. I'll go."</p>

<p>His efforts were rather unsuccessful; but still
he managed to get out of the room. Sir Charles
stood by and let him pass.</p>

<p>"What will he do?" he said to the old butler.
"He oughtn't to go out alone."</p>

<p>"He's so mad with me already, Sir Charles, for
trying to get him out of here before Mrs. Rex

<!-- page 266 -->

came down, that I daren't interfere any more."</p>

<p>"Where is Rex?" said Sir Charles. "I'll get
him to come. I can't take the responsibility."</p>

<p>Sir Charles went upstairs and summoned Rex,
who came out to him, with a very white face full
of emotion. Sir Charles could hear Margery sobbing. 
She had broken down at last.</p>

<p>"We can do nothing with Oliver," said Sir
Charles.&mdash;"Hark, he has gone out of the house.
He's not fit to be about alone; besides it's a disgrace, 
and the servants are afraid of him. Come
with me."</p>

<p>"Stay with Margery," said Rex, a sudden fierce
sternness coming into his face. He went quickly
downstairs, and out at the door.</p>

<p>Oliver had gone across to the stables, with staggering 
strides. It was easy for Rex to pick him
up. He did so, passed him, turned and looked at
him and then went into the harness-room. Oliver
called to a groom to bring him his horse; and
then followed Rex to the door of the harness-room.
Here, where the happiest days of their boyhood
had been spent, the two stood, face to face. Rex

<!-- page 267 -->

had taken down a horsewhip and was coming to
the door as Oliver entered. The two faces were
terrible from the hatred that was in them both;
but Oliver's was disfigured and brutalized by the
condition he was in. Rex raised the whip for a
second and felt all the hungry fury of longing
to lash this detestable image of himself into
shame; but the expression of the face before him
filled him with contempt too great for even such
a deed.</p>

<p>"I'll wait," he said, throwing the whip down,
"till you're sober and can understand the lesson
I mean to give you."</p>

<p>"Yes, wait," sneered Oliver, "that's all you're
good for. It is like a coward to threaten and
draw back."</p>

<p>His horse was brought into the yard at that
moment and he stepped back through the doorway. 
He had just sense enough to know that he
was in no condition to meet a man of his own
strength. Mad as he was, he was not mad enough
for that. But he had said too much, in his rage.
Rex stooped, picked up the horsewhip and in an

<!-- page 268 -->

instant had caught him by the collar and was
dealing him blow after blow. Instantly, and as if
by magic, the yard was full of men, gazing at the
horrible scene. It only lasted a minute. Oliver
wrenched himself free, flung Rex back with all his
force and sprang on to his horse. He was spurred,
and he dug the spurs into the animal's sides so that
it sprang forward and scattered the servants right
and left. A moment later and it could be heard
thundering down the avenue like a creature possessed.</p>

<p>Rex walked across the yard to the house silent,
white, looking very strange. The men kept back
from him and went away whispering together.
On the steps of the house Rex found Sir Charles.</p>

<p>"He's on Black Bess," Sir Charles exclaimed,
the moment he caught sight of him. "He'll lame
her as he lamed Graybeard. It's cruel work.
What made you let him go?"</p>

<p>Rex walked into the house without answering.
Margery was standing in the hall, white and
trembling.</p>

<p>"Rex! what has happened?" she exclaimed.

<!-- page 269 -->

"Why do you look like that? What have you
done to him?"</p>

<p>"Lashed him like the hound he is," answered
Rex, "or rather, as we beat the dogs that are
twenty thousand times as good as such men."</p>

<p>Sir Charles had come into the ball, and at this
he uttered an exclamation of amazement. So
far no confidence had passed beyond Rex and
Margery.</p>

<p>"What does he mean?" said Sir Charles to his
daughter.</p>

<p>"I don't know, father," she said. "Don't ask&mdash;let 
it be. They have quarrelled terribly, that is
all."</p>

<p>"Shall I go home now, Madge?" said Sir
Charles, "or would you rather I stayed with you?"</p>

<p>"I think you'd like to go, wouldn't you?" she
said.</p>

<p>"Only because of Black Bess. I know he'll
ill-use her. But we can send a groom to see to
that if you want me."</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I will go to Rex. He has shut
himself in the study, but I will get him to let me

<!-- page 270 -->

in. You go, papa; I know you are anxious to get
home. Come as soon as you can."</p>

<p>Sir Charles was soon gone, for his heart was at
the moment with his favorite mare.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 271 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER XXII.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> hour later and Heriot Hall was roused from
a deep silence into which it had fallen by a tremendous 
knocking at the front door. There had been
no dinner, and the servants had given up all hopes
of there being any. There was the peculiar atmosphere 
in the house which is produced by sickness or
acute trouble. The servants were all together in
the housekeeper's room, talking over the different
scenes of the day in low voices. Rex and Margery
were still shut in the study. There was scarcely
a sound in the house. Upon this silence the loud
knocking fell with the most startling effect. The
impression of some fresh misfortune was produced
by it instantly.</p>

<p>Rex came out of the study just as the hall door
was opened, and saw Sir Charles standing on the
doorstep. One glance at him was enough to show
that something had happened.</p>

<!-- page 272 -->

<p>"What is it?" said Rex.</p>

<p>"Dead," said Sir Charles, "both dead."</p>

<p>"Who? what?" exclaimed Rex.</p>

<p>"Horse and man both&mdash;Oliver and Black Bess.
He must have been possessed by a devil! Tell the
men to come with lights and carry him to the
house."</p>

<p>By the time they reached the spot&mdash;a dark place
in a lane, where there was a sudden and very steep
hill&mdash;there were a number of people there, carrying
lanterns and torches. The news spread abroad like
wildfire, and the village turned out in a body to
see if it was true. True indeed; poor Black Bess,
a shapeless mass at the bottom of the hill, and
Oliver crushed beneath her.</p>

<p>A dark, solemn procession came up the hill some
time later, with Oliver's body in its midst, laid on
an improvised stretcher. Sir Charles lingered behind 
to see the body of the poor mare laid decently,
and arranged for its burial on the morrow, then
walked up to the Hall alone, in the dark, thinking
very seriously.</p>

<p>"No doubt it's best!" he said to himself, "no

<!-- page 273 -->

doubt it's best. I was fond of the boy, and I shall
miss him; but he was going to the bad too fast.
It's long since he had an hour of happiness, and it's
long before he would have had one. And he's
brought trouble to my Madge; that I'm sure of.
For her sake he's well out of the way."</p>

<p>And Sir Charles was perhaps the best friend
Oliver had in the world!</p>

<p>How little we guess how little we are missed.</p>

<p>But there was one heart yet to suffer; and
strangely enough it was one that Oliver valued
not at all.</p>

<p>Mr. Carruthers came to the Hall later in the
evening to know if what he had heard was true.
Oliver's body lay in the dining-room, and was
sufficient answer in itself. He went quickly home
again, after a few words with Rex and Sir Charles.</p>

<p>Hetty was waiting for him, all the lovely color
gone from her face, and a wild agony in her
beautiful blue eyes.</p>

<p>"It's true, Hetty," said her brother.</p>

<p>"Oh, how am I to bear it!" she exclaimed.</p>

<!-- page 274 -->

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Extract from Mrs. Rex Heriot's Diary</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>"I hope this is the last entry I shall ever make
in this terrible little hook! It holds the history of
a horror; and surely I have suffered enough in the
course of that history, and shall not be condemned
by fate to bear more of the same kind! Nothing
else could stand beside it or be written of in the
same pages. No every-day troubles or any trials
of ordinary life could be thought of at the same
time as this experience.</p>

<p>"To think of that poor soul gone straight into
Eternity in the midst of his sin!</p>

<p>"The one thought with all of us is Hetty. I
think now that she will live, but for a long time
we feared she would not. A little color is coming
back to the pale face now, a little life into the sad
eyes.</p>

<p>"We have all agreed to tell her nothing more of
Oliver's real character and history than she already
knew. It is better and much happier for her only
to mourn him as one dead, not to have to see her

<!-- page 275 -->

idol shattered and broken to pieces before her
eyes. I am glad, very glad, for her sake that she
never knew him to be what he was. She will
always think of him tenderly instead of with
horror.</p>

<p>"I cannot yet quite shake off the horror. I think
it will be more or less with me all my life.</p>

<p>"In those awful hours I passed in Rex's dressing-room, 
I saw the deed done over and over again, so
plainly that I suffered all the agony of its actually
being done. Oh, Rex, I never knew till then how
I loved you! And in that dark hour I learned
what it is to kill the thing one loves, to add the
agony of grief to the remorse for sin. I do not
know how I kept my sanity. Even now I constantly 
wake shuddering and trembling at night,
thinking it is all true and no mere dream of
horror, as it mercifully was.</p>

<p>"But how nearly it was true! If remorse had
not driven him to drink and broken his will it
would have been true. Oh, how horrible!</p>

<p>"I can sit and ponder for hours at a time trying
to disentangle the mystery of the thing. Whose

<!-- page 276 -->

was the guilt? Whose would have been the
guilt?&mdash;his or mine? I who did the deeds or he
who suggested them? Alas! I think he knew the
guilt was his, or he would not have died that
awful death."</p>
