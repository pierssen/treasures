<h2>THE LITTLE CHEVALIER</h2>

<p>I</p>

<p class="small">THE PLACE D'ARMES</p>

</div>

<p>DE VALDETERRE paused on the
crest of the sodded levee and
looked about him with a keen
interest&mdash;not unmixed with a certain
amazed contempt. La Sarabande, the
high-breasted ship which he had quitted
a moment before, had been made fast to
iron-ringed cypress posts by the waterside,
and her huge bulk was already rising
and falling gently on a light swirl of the
river&mdash;that storied Mississippi which
for a century and more had been calling
with a siren's voice across the sea to the
young blood of France. With its dull,
low-lying shores&mdash;parted by a mile of

<!-- page 2 -->

yellow water, topped with muddy foam
and strewn with a wrack of matted
leaves and twigs, upreared tree-roots
and half-submerged tree-trunks&mdash;the
river had been distinctly disappointing,
from its mouth upward, to the newcomer;
it lacked the anticipated majesty&mdash;the
mighty rush and roar, the headlong plunge toward the Mexican sea&mdash;of
La Salle's fabled River of Misfortune.
De Valdeterre experienced a growing
scorn for this wide expanse of turbid
tranquillity,&mdash;having as yet no conception
of the inexorable monster at this
moment quiescent on his reedy bed.</p>

<p>A swarm of light water-craft danced
beneath the rounded sides of the Sarabande,
or darted diagonally back and
forth, to and from the Plantations du
Roi on the western shore of the river.
Some of these were large canoes with
up-curved ends; others narrow pirogues
born of the sinuous bayou and the trackless

<!-- page 3 -->

<i>cypri&egrave;re</i> of the interior wilderness.
Though unaware of the delicate skill
necessary to the management of the latter,
the stranger's face lighted with admiration
at the ease and dexterity with
which the single occupants of the needle-like
barques guided them with a sweep
of the long paddle in and out among the
clumsy keel-boats and heavy-bottomed
barges which moved sluggishly alongshore,
or lay moored against the levee.
He uttered a pleased exclamation on
perceiving that several of the paddlers
were Indians, with fierce black locks and
tawny skins; oddly picturesque in coarse
blankets, beaded belts, and doeskin leggings.
He had seen such from time to
time in Paris, whither, arrayed in barbaric
splendor, they had been fetched to
illustrate the glory of John Law's Eldorado,
or the futile visions of his successors.
There they had had the vague
unreality of dreams; here, they seemed

<!-- page 4 -->

to give verity to the vanished Eldorado
itself. In the gay dark faces and loquacious
tongues of the canoe-men he recognized
the more familiar type of the
Canadian voyageur&mdash;a more frequent
estray into the cabarets of Paris; and
here and there a pair of blue eyes beneath
a shock of sunburnt hair proclaimed
an American flatboatman adventured
hither from the far-off rivers of
Kentucky, or the twisting streams of
Tennessee. The '<i>M&eacute;ricain</i> reddened menacingly
under the stranger's polite stare;
the Canadian filliped a familiar forefinger
in his direction and laughed in his
face. "Oh&eacute;, m'sieu le Bateleur," called
a slim youngster standing, legs apart, in
easy poise on the swaying bow of his
cockle-shell. "Oh&eacute;! Faites danser votre
marionette l&agrave;, s'il vous plait!"</p>

<p>Chapron, the old servant,&mdash;somewhat
wooden indeed in appearance, stiff and
erect in his long-bodied black coat and

<!-- page 5 -->

neat small-clothes, carrying his master's
portmanteau and cloak,&mdash;scowled angrily;
but de Valdeterre answered the
pleasantry in kind and turned to continue
his survey.</p>

<p>The levee, scarce ten years old, following
the curves of the river, stretched out
in either direction as far as the eye could
reach; the sloping sides were overlaid
with a thick growth of tough grass&mdash;at
this moment lightly scorched by the
mild breath of a semi-tropical midwinter;
the broad level top, worn smooth by
trampling feet, was outlined by a double
row of cottonwood trees whose leafless
branches were silhouetted against a
bright blue sky. On the landward side a
sweep of low marshy ground separated
the plantations of young willows, which
fringed the base of the embankment,
from the Place d'Armes, or Military
Square of the capital of the Province.</p>

<p>It was the year of our Lord 1752;

<!-- page 6 -->

the Mississippi Bubble had long ago burst&mdash;long
ago, that is, as the years of the
young colony were measured; the Scotchman's
soaring scheme had collapsed, leaving
but shreds of its wild imaginings hanging
in the sky above France for dreamers
to clutch at, or for unscrupulous speculators
to weave into fresh webs for the
unwary.</p>

<p>The young Vicomte de Valdeterre, setting
his face westward, had followed no
dissolving mirage. The impulse which led
him to the province of Louisiana had its
roots in far other soil than those "shores,
whose very sands are gold,"&mdash;sung a
score or more years earlier by the delirious
court-poets of the Regency. But his
dreams had been unconsciously tinged by
the universal <i>couleur de rose</i> through
which Young France, despite warning and
experience, continued to regard the Land
Beyond the Sea. He had conjured up,
during the long, wearisome voyage across

<!-- page 7 -->

the Atlantic in the cumbersome Sarabande,
a fantasy of definite shape, goodly
to the inner eye,&mdash;the conceit of a fair
city where the Marquis de Vaudreuil held
his miniature court. He had pictured to
himself the busy quays faced with great
warehouses, looking out upon the dashing
sea-blue current of the Mississippi;
the stately mansions beyond; the arched
bridges spanning those aqueducts described
in the illuminated leaflets displayed
in the book stalls around the Palais
de Justice or on the Pont Neuf; the processions
of slaves like those in the Thousand
and One Nights, bearing all manner
of strange and rich merchandise through
wide boulevards into busy exchanges;
the curiously clad envoys from Mexican
or Indian courts bartering, in the antechambers
of the Palace, ingots of gold
and silver for Parisian stuffs.</p>

<p>He smiled after these vanishing chimeras
as he picked his way across the

<!-- page 8 -->

marshy level, followed by Chapron; and
passing the outlying stalls where itinerant
peddlers dispensed their wares to motley
crowds of sailors, Indians, ex-galley slaves,
Canadian <i>coureurs de bois</i>, American traders,
idlers of every description, he entered
the inclosed quadrangle known as
the Place d'Armes.</p>

<p>The square, surrounded by a cypress
picket fence,&mdash;broken on each side by a
wide wooden gate,&mdash;was crossed and recrossed
at right angles by dusty footways;
a few cottonwood saplings were set in
prim array along the main walks; their
trunks showed white and naked against
the glistening green of a clump of young
orange-trees massed in the centre. On its
upper side this heart of the young town
was faced by a small brick church; de
Valdeterre piously removed his hat as his
eyes fell upon the cross surmounting the
wooden spire; to the left of the church,
half hidden in embowering shrubs and

<!-- page 9 -->

vines, stood a galleried and jalousied building,
resembling with its pillared wings
some small ch&acirc;teau at Auteuil or Chantilly.
An almost princely sweep of garden
and orchard was visible in the rear of the
house over a low brick wall; some monks
in black gowns were busy among the garden
beds. On the right of the church
arose a compact brick edifice which de
Valdeterre rightly judged to be a guardhouse
or prison. Rows of squat shops and
open booths, interspersed with more pretentious
two-storied houses, half brick,
half cypress, flanked the square north
and south.</p>

<p>The Place was picturesquely thronged;
men passed and repassed, hurrying about
their business, or were gathered in groups
discussing the news just brought in from
the West Indies by the Sarabande; some
stood apart turning the thin, fluttering
pages of letters, six months old, from
France; there were workmen in conventional

<!-- page 10 -->

cap and blouse; negresses from
the Halles, or market near by, stepping
lightly homeward, baskets poised on turbaned
heads, hands on ample hips; priests
in the garb of the Capuchin order; officers
in the king's uniform; and a goodly
sprinkling of the more substantial citizens
of the town. These last, the stranger
noted, were attired with almost foppish
elegance, but for the most part in a costume
familiar to Paris a couple of years
earlier. As he made his way through the
shifting crowd, more than one of his late
fellow passengers called or beckoned to
him, but waving a courteous hand he
hurried on. Three or four young women,
attended by negro handmaids, grave, elderly,
watchful, came out of the church
at the moment he approached the upper
gateway; they regarded the handsome,
pale-faced young man in his sombre
mourning garb furtively but approvingly.
He passed on unconscious of

<!-- page 11 -->

their scrutiny, looking uncertainly about
him as if in search of some special object
or place.</p>

<p>On the upper corner of Rue Chartres,
after a glance at the swinging sign above
the door, he turned into <i>Le Veau qui
T&ecirc;te</i>, the famous caf&eacute; of Monsieur Jean
Marie Raguet. A number of small tables
were scattered over the sanded floor of
the public-room; at one of these, two
men in light coats and flowered waistcoats,
wide hats, tasseled belts, and dangling
small-swords, were seated with
bottle and glasses before them. The
proprietor of The Sucking Calf, a lean,
swarthy, ear-ringed Gascon, leaned idly
over his wooden bar. De Valdeterre consulted
the slip of paper in his hand.
"Monsieur Jean Marie"&mdash;he began
politely.</p>

<p>The vacant face of the innkeeper instantly
reassumed its wonted look of
intelligent attention; he straightened

<!-- page 12 -->

himself and rubbed his leathery palms
together: "Raguet, Jean Marie Raguet.
Yes, m'sieu. At the service of m'sieu."
He pushed a decanter across the unpainted
bar, and reached to a shelf behind
him for a glass. "Or," with a more
critical glance at his guest, he hastened
to add, "perhaps m'sieu would prefer"&mdash;he
indicated a table by the vine-draped
window.</p>

<p>But no. It appeared that monsieur was
not at the present moment in need of
refreshment. He was seeking lodgings;
Captain Marchand of the good ship Sarabande,
well known doubtless to Monsieur
Jean Marie&mdash;</p>

<p>"Raguet," interrupted the innkeeper
with a suave bow. "Jean Marie Raguet.
At the service of m'sieu."</p>

<p>&mdash;Had recommended the well-kept
<i>chambres garnies</i> of Madame Raguet;
also the cuisine of Madame&mdash;</p>

<p>The proprietor of The Sucking Calf

<!-- page 13 -->

became radiant. He assured monsieur
volubly with much outspreading of arms
and many tappings of a bony forefinger
on the bar that the <i>apartement</i> of Jacqueline
Raguet, situated in the rear of the
inner court, and approached at need by
an alley from Rue St. Pierre, was of an
elegance hardly to be described; and as
for that cuisine of Jacqueline Raguet,
who had fetched the art from Paris, ciel!
how it was magnificent! If m'sieu would
but attend a moment&mdash;Jean Marie disappeared
abruptly, leaving the caf&eacute; in
sole possession of monsieur, his valet,
and the two aristocrats at their table.</p>

<p>De Valdeterre glanced carelessly at
the latter; one of them was a man of his
own age, thirty or thereabout, frank-faced,
open-browed, and attractive; the
other, much older, had, it seemed to the
keen eye of the observer, one of those
broad fair faces which seem at a distance
to present an appearance of engaging

<!-- page 14 -->

amiability; but which on nearer inspection
reveal sinister and forbidding lines:
he had lifted his glass and appeared to
be offering a toast, though only the words
"Le Petit Chevalier" reached the listener's
ears; they were accompanied by a
smile which affected de Valdeterre unpleasantly,
though he could not have told
why. He turned hastily to meet Jean
Marie, who had entered, followed by M&egrave;re
Jacqueline, that famous M&egrave;re Jacqueline,
who, fat as her husband was lean, and
taciturn as he was garrulous, was for
half a century, the patron saint of the
gourmands of this Little Versailles by
the Mississippi.</p>

<p>"Will m'sieu be pleased to ascend to
his suite?" suggested Raguet obsequiously.</p>

<p>De Valdeterre paused on the threshold.
"Have the goodness. Monsieur Raguet,
to direct my servant presently to the
residence of the Chevalier de la Roche."</p>

<!-- page 15 -->

<p>"But certainly, m'sieu," cried Jean
Marie, delighted, "the Ch&acirc;teau de la
Roche! 'Tis a step only&mdash;by way of the
Porte St. Jean. But the Chevalier de la
Roche"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Very well." The vicomte had turned
impatiently on his heel.</p>

<p>The older of the two remaining guests
stared after his retreating form. "What
the devil," he growled, "does this impertinent
macaroni want at the Ch&acirc;teau de
la Roche!"</p>

<p>"Ma foi, Delaup," laughed his companion,
"you scent a hawk in the faintest
shadow of a wing! Yonder is as
pale and spiritless a moth, meseems, as
ever fluttered into the garden of the
Little Chevalier. <i>Macaroni!</i> A death-head,
rather! He looks fitter for the
ministrations of S&oelig;ur St. Stanislaus at
the hospital than for "&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hold your confounded tongue, Gailliard,"
interrupted the other irritably.

<!-- page 16 -->

"It ding-dongs worse than the bell-clapper
of Jean Marie himself. Hey, Raguet,"
he added, "how long must a gentleman
wait for his reckoning in your pest-hole
of a wineshop!"</p>

<p>II</p>

<p class="small">A CHALLENGE</p>

</div>

<p>DE VALDETERRE followed Madame
Raguet across the large
courtyard in the rear of the caf&eacute;
and up a flight of stairs, into the <i>apartement</i>
so highly recommended by the captain
of the Sarabande. He found it in
truth quite as good as he expected, airy
and well lighted, though somewhat bare&mdash;the
bed in a curtained alcove, a table,
a chair, a washstand, and a chest of
drawers constituting the only furniture
of the single room. He took small note
of these or of M&egrave;re Jacqueline's brief explanations
and unostentatious exit. He
sank into the wooden chair and closed his
eyes while Chapron silently and skillfully
unpacked his portmanteau and placed

<!-- page 18 -->

upon the table before him a small portfolio
and writing materials. He was feeling
suddenly faint and exhausted; the
tropical fever which had attacked him
while the Sarabande made her long wait
for repairs at San Domingo had left him
but a residue of the strength which until
then he had unconsciously enjoyed.
For a moment he felt a strong temptation
to throw himself upon the bed and yield
to the sense of helplessness against which
for weeks he had successfully struggled.
But as he languidly opened his eyes they
rested upon the portfolio. A thrill of returning
life shot through his veins. He
sat up, instantly alert and eager. "You
may go and make arrangements for your
own sleeping cabinet," he said to his servant.
"I will ring"&mdash;he looked around
vaguely for a bell rope&mdash;"I will need you
within the hour," he concluded. "Be
within call."</p>

<p>"The breakfast of Monsieur Henri"&mdash;suggested

<!-- page 19 -->

Chapron, lingering respectfully
by the table. "It is already long past
noon and monsieur has eaten nothing since
yesterday."</p>

<p>"I shall not breakfast," interrupted
his master curtly. "Go. Later, perhaps,
a cup of wine and a biscuit. See that you
breakfast yourself, however," he added
kindly.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Monsieur le Vicomte." Chapron
retired, closing the door behind him.
De Valdeterre drew toward him a sheet
of paper and dipped a pen into the traveling
inkstand. With his left hand he
smoothed out some folded papers he had
extracted from the portfolio. He wrote
a single line at the top of the sheet.</p>

<p>"<i>To Monsieur le Chevalier de la Roche</i>."</p>

<p>Then he leaned back, dizzy with the
realization that the moment so long
awaited had at length arrived.</p>

<p>He reviewed that gray dawn in the
January of 1734, he being himself then

<!-- page 20 -->

a lad of ten years, when his father, the
Vicomte Henri Nadan de Valdeterre, was
brought home from a neighboring close
gasping for breath, with the life-blood
gushing from a ghastly wound in his
breast. The commotion in the great de
Valdeterre hotel in the Faubourg St. Germaine
was as present to the son's bodily
senses at this moment as if it had been
yesterday&mdash;the frantic, aimless runnings
hither and thither of the terrified servants;
the hurried consultation of the
<i>chirurgiens</i> over the dying man, stretched
out on the floor of the grand salon, where,
the night before, a throng of brilliantly
attired men and women had gathered,
mingling the light echoes of their voices
with the sobbing tones of the violins in
the dancing-hall beyond; his own white
and scared face as he saw it reflected in
one of the festooned mirrors; above all,
the sudden ghostlike apparition of his
mother in her trailing night-robe with a

<!-- page 21 -->

gay dressing-gown drawn hastily over
her shoulders and her small bare feet
thrust into her ball slippers. Her single
piercing shriek still rang in his ears; he
quivered again from head to foot, seeing
her as in a vision fall like a broken flower
across the dead man's breast.</p>

<p>The scene had never lost its poignancy;
but it had never seemed so real as here in
this New World whither his father's
slayer had fled from a just vengeance,
and where he had remained, banished by
a <i>lettre de cachet</i> of the king, these eighteen
years.</p>

<p>Nadan de Valdeterre had lived only
long enough to exonerate Valcour de la
Roche, his antagonist; they had met,
he declared with his dying breath, with
equal swords, and on prearranged terms
agreeable to both. His son, the young
Vicomte Henri, despite this declaration,
had grown to manhood with the cherished
intention of one day seeking the

<!-- page 22 -->

Chevalier de la Roche and demanding
revenge for his father's death. His mother,
clinging to him with all the fervor
of an affection which has no other object,
had opposed this purpose with feverish
vehemence. A trivial quarrel under his
own roof&mdash;as had later transpired&mdash;with
his bosom friend&mdash;and the best
swordsman in France&mdash;had cost her
husband his life, and left her widowed
and forlorn. She shuddered at the mere
thought of her only child baring his
breast to the same relentless blade.</p>

<p>"Leave vengeance to God, my son,"
she commanded. "Besides, Valcour de la
Roche is disgraced and exiled, and his
estates confiscated. Who knows what
wretchedness and misfortune may not
have pursued him and his children into
that distant country."</p>

<p>"He had children, then?" demanded
Henri curiously.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Madame de Valdeterre;

<!-- page 23 -->

"there were two children, motherless,
alas! a boy and a girl. It was even the
wish of your father and Valcour"&mdash;</p>

<p>She checked herself abruptly, the tears
gathering in her beautiful sunken eyes.
"Thou wilt not even think again of so
mad a scheme, Henri. Oh, my son, promise
me, promise me!"</p>

<p>He soothed her tenderly, this lovely
young mother with the prematurely gray
hair, but forbore to promise. This conversation
had taken place when he was
about fifteen years old. He had never
afterward during his mother's lifetime
referred to the determination which remained
inexorable, though secret, in his
breast. But now, that gentle soul had
escaped from the frail body. His mother
was dead, and he was free! He was
treading at last the same soil which for
nearly a score of years had been pressed
by the feet of Valcour de la Roche! And
this was not all; he caressed the folded

<!-- page 24 -->

document under his left hand and smiled
grimly. It bore the royal seal of France,
and the formally worded page within
witnessed the fact that all properties acquired
in the province of Louisiana&mdash;namely,
plantations, houses, mines, jewels,
or moneys&mdash;by the banished Valcour
M&eacute;ry, Chevalier de la Roche, were confiscate
to the bearer of the said state paper,
to wit, Henri Louis Nadan, Vicomte de
Valdeterre; and thereto His Majesty
Louis XV. of France had set his royal
hand, at Versailles on the 1st day of
August, 1751.</p>

<p>The vicomte resumed his pen with nervous
haste. The note was speedily written;
he had composed it, pacing the deck
of the Sarabande, under the silent midnight
skies of the tropics; he had learned
it by heart, tossing half delirious on his
sick bed at San Domingo; he had repeated
it to himself a thousand times
during the succeeding voyage across the

<!-- page 25 -->

storm-swept Mexican sea. There was
not a superfluous word in its curt sentences.</p>

<br/>

<p>When I have informed Monsieur le
Chevalier de la Roche [he wrote] that I
am but this moment landed on these
shores, and that I am the son of that
Vicomte de Valdeterre who fell wounded
unto death in a duel in the <i>Clos de Vignes</i>
on the 5th of January, 1734, he will understand
why I am addressing him this
note. I am fortunate in the date of my
arrival, as he will also understand. It is
my ardent desire to cross swords with
Monsieur de la Roche on this day, if possible.
And, as the encounter of the 5th
of January, 1734, had no witnesses, if
it meets with the approval of monsieur,
the encounter of the 5th of January,
1752, shall also be without witnesses.
Will it please the Chevalier de la Roche,
since I am a stranger in these parts, to

<!-- page 26 -->

designate a time and a place where I
may repay with interest the obligation
which the House of Valdeterre owes to
that of la Roche?</p>

<p>(<i>Signed</i>)<br/>

<span class="smcap">Henri Louis Nadan de Valdeterre</span>.</p>

<br/>

<p>The writer sanded, folded, and sealed
the note with his father's signet, and
summoned his servant.</p>

<p>Chapron, having made friendly acquaintance
with Jean Marie, was gossiping
over a bottle of claret with that
worthy at a table set in the sunfilled
courtyard, under the leafless branches
of an enormous grapevine which clambered
up the rear wall of the wineshop
and swung itself clear across the court
to the galleried <i>chambres garnies</i> of M&egrave;re
Jacqueline. He arose with a sigh and a
reticent shake of the head at his master's
call; he listened gravely while the young
man charged him to conduct his errand

<!-- page 27 -->

with his accustomed secrecy and discretion;
and having placed the letter in an
inner pocket, he obtained the promised
directions from Monsieur Raguet, and
set out on his errand.</p>

<p>The vicomte, from whom all weariness
had vanished as if by a miracle, wrote
two other letters to be delivered in the
case of his death: one to his kinsman,
the Marquis de Vaudreuil, governor of
the province of Louisiana, explaining the
mission upon which he had come, and discharging
his opponent from any suspicion
of indirect dealing; the other to his executors
in Paris. Then he began what
seemed to him an interminable time of
waiting, striding back and forth with impatient
steps in the hushed room.</p>

<p>"One would suppose that the Chevalier
de la Roche had forgotten how to
write!" he muttered at length, "or that
he is in no haste to settle his account
with the House of Valdeterre." But he

<!-- page 28 -->

smiled at his own words as they passed
his lips.</p>

<p>For there had not been wanting during
these eighteen years&mdash;as he had been
told by those who had his own welfare at
heart, or were wearying the king for de
la Roche's pardon and recall&mdash;there had
not lacked news of the chevalier's bravery
in the Indian wars of the colony, his
valiant leadership and reckless daring,
his haughty and insolent bearing toward
certain of his co-colonists in the province.
Latterly, the chronicles had been silent
concerning him. What if he had fallen
ill? What if&mdash; Great drops of perspiration
started on the young man's forehead
at the thought of being balked, even by
death, of his long-anticipated and eagerly
awaited revenge. But at that moment
the door opened and Chapron entered.
He took a letter from his bosom and
handed it to his master. De Valdeterre
broke the seal with hands that trembled.</p>

<!-- page 29 -->

<p>"<i>To the Vicomte de Valdeterre</i>."</p>

<p>The handwriting, though small and
somewhat formal and old-fashioned, was
bold and firm. Evidently the hand that
had traced these lines was unaffected by
age or exile; the Chevalier de la Roche,
the reader reflected swiftly, must be hard
upon forty-five.</p>

<br/>

<p>Monsieur le Vicomte de Valdeterre
[the note ran] is welcome to the shores
of Louisiana, where, indeed, he has been
expected these several years. His desire
to settle accounts with the House of la
Roche reflects credit upon his birth and
the traditions of the illustrious family to
which he belongs.</p>

<p>It will give the writer pleasure to add
to the obligations which the vicomte is
under to la Roche. At three and a half
o'clock this afternoon, if monsieur will
hold himself in readiness, he will be conducted
to the place of rendezvous. The

<!-- page 30 -->

wishes of the Vicomte de Valdeterre shall
be respected in every particular.</p>

<span class="smcap">Valcour de la Roche</span>.</p>

<br/>

<p>De Valdeterre consulted his watch
eagerly; it wanted less than an hour to
the appointed time. He spent this in refreshing
his toilet and in giving a few
brief but explicit instructions to his servant,
who, accustomed to the vagaries of
the youth of the time, listened intelligently
and imperturbably, though a wistful
expression dawned into his eyes as
he buckled his master's sword-belt and
handed him his leather gauntlets.</p>

<p>Precisely at half-past three a light tap
sounded on the door; Chapron opened
the door and stood aside.</p>

<p>In spite of his preoccupation the vicomte
hardly repressed an exclamation.
The expected messenger was a negro,
coal-black and of gigantic proportions;

<!-- page 31 -->

his superb modeling and erect carriage,
joined to an almost imperious bearing,
gave him an air of singular dignity in
spite of the thick lips, flat nose, and crisp
hair which accentuated his race. He wore
a sort of livery composed of dark blue
cloth with violet facings; de Valdeterre
recalled these with a fleeting pang as the
colors of the House of la Roche.</p>

<p>"From the Chevalier de la Roche?"
he demanded, advancing a step.</p>

<p>"Oui, mich&eacute;." The negro made a deep
obeisance and added a few words in a
patois compounded of French and his native
African tongue. This patois, though
uncouth in construction, was soft syllabled
and caressing in sound. De Valdeterre,
who had heard it on the quays and
about the market-places in San Domingo,
understood it sufficiently to be aware that
the man was offering to conduct him to
the rendezvous; he threw his short cloak
over his shoulders, drew his slouched hat

<!-- page 32 -->

over his brows, and addressing a last word
to Chapron, he waved his guide forward.</p>

<p>"Oui, mich&eacute;;" the negro made another
obeisance. "M'app&eacute; Achille," he volunteered
with a sudden winning smile which
lighted his sombre face and gave to the
vicomte's old domestic a sense of security.</p>

<p>Achille led the way down the stair and
across the courtyard, skirting the rear of
the caf&eacute;, through whose open door Jean
Marie was visible, leaning over his bar
and tapping the wood with a restless forefinger
while he discussed the affairs of
the colony with a pair of leathery compatriots.
The narrow alleyway between
two unbroken brick walls led into Rue
St. Pierre.</p>

<p>The unpaved street was almost deserted,
but Rue Royale, into which de
Valdeterre presently turned, sauntering
with a careless air a few paces behind
his guide, presented an animated scene.
This was the principal thoroughfare of

<!-- page 33 -->

the town; it was compact with houses,
for the most part small and insignificant,
though there were a few buildings&mdash;almost
stately&mdash;which gave promise of
some far-off future fulfillment of Parisian
dreams. At this, the hour most in vogue
for the fashionable promenade,&mdash;the
chief amusement of the miniature court
of the Marquis de Vaudreuil,&mdash;the narrow
and uneven banquettes swarmed
with fine ladies and courtly gentlemen,
the former in hooped petticoats and paniers,
the latter in long cloaks, periwigs,
and feathered hats; all, as de Valdeterre
remarked again with an inward smile, a
year or two at least behind the constantly
changing modes of the greater
Versailles. There was a nonchalant swagger
about the men, as if the freedom of
the New World had loosened some unseen
gyves; and an indolent grace about
the women&mdash;a soft and easy languor in
their movements&mdash;which fascinated the

<!-- page 34 -->

newcomer as it continues in their descendants
to fascinate the stranger after
the lapse of a century and a half. He
caught himself turning more than once
to gaze after a group of these, vanishing
into the dim recesses of a <i>magasin des
atours</i>, or descending a latticed corridor.
A plentiful admixture in the promenaders
of officers in the uniform of the king's
army reminded him sharply of the business
in hand, and he pressed upon the
negro's heels. There were but few vehicles
to be seen; those which jolted past
were heavy and lumbering, fitting the
muddy, unpaved street; but near the
corner of Rue d'Orl&eacute;ans, in the rear of the
Church St. Louis, he stopped&mdash;one of a
jostling crowd which pressed respectfully
forward to see his excellency the governor
of Louisiana drive slowly by in his
state coach, drawn by four gayly caparisoned
horses, on his way to the Palace.
The marquis, a handsome and attractive

<!-- page 35 -->

young man, removed his hat, bowing and
smiling as he passed; the equally handsome
but haughty dame seated beside
him vouchsafed neither smile nor bow to
the rabble.</p>

<p>"My cousin the marquise, methinks,"
murmured de Valdeterre, picking his way
on, "is in a dream of royalty, like unto
the Barber's Fifth Brother! Let us trust
that she may not with that pretty foot of
hers kick over and smash both her dream
and her basket of crockery! Hullo!"</p>

<p>He stooped to pick up the small mite of
humanity over which he had unwittingly
stumbled, and to soothe the gamin's
tears by the purchase of a king-cake
which hung, temptingly crusty, in a
baker's window at his elbow. Why, of
course! The morrow would be the Epiphany!
He caught himself up and hastened
after Achille, who had been well-nigh
swallowed up in the crowd. To-morrow
would be the Epiphany! And

<!-- page 36 -->

this day, the 5th of January, was the anniversary
of that tragedy he had crossed
the seas to avenge! For a moment his
thoughts were unaccountably confused;
he seemed to have to force himself to remember.
But his brain cleared; his heart
gave a sudden savage leap; he had almost
broken into a run. He checked
himself and followed his conductor, who
had turned into Rue du Maine, and looking
back over his shoulder from time to time,
was striding along the uneven footway
between the muddy street and one of
those open ditches which surrounded each
of the squares or "islets" composing the
town as laid out by the royal engineer,
Blond de la Tour. The scattered houses
along the street were mostly hidden by
high fences made of hewn cypress stakes.</p>

<p>A few moments' walk brought the two
men to the rampart&mdash;a high embankment
of earth crowned by a stockade of
rough logs&mdash;which formed the outer or

<!-- page 37 -->

swamp barrier of New Orleans. Two
small pentagonal forts, Fort St. Jean
and Fort St. Ferdinand, connected by a
covered way, protected this part of the
city wall. De Valdeterre eyed these Lilliputian
defenses with curiosity as he
mounted the rampart, and passed through
the Porte St. Jean, and over the lowered
drawbridge spanning the broad moat, to
the open road beyond.</p>

<p>He barely glanced at the great sweep
of <i>cypri&egrave;re</i> which stretched away, sombre
and silent, toward Lake Pontchartrain, for
the negro, quitting that pretense of a
highway known as the Bayou Road, had
entered a grove of live-oaks on the right.
On the farther side of a small <i>coul&eacute;e</i> or
prairie beyond, he stopped before a gate
set in a palisaded wall. The batten gate
valves were painted a light green; tossing
masses of foliage, of a darker green,
showed on either side above the huge
gate-posts.</p>

<!-- page 38 -->

<p>Achille took a clumsy-looking key from
the pouch which hung from his girdle
and applied it to the lock; the ponderous
gates swung inward; he motioned
his companion to enter, and stepping in
after him, he closed and relocked the
gate.</p>

<p>"Monsieur will please follow this
path," he said courteously, in his musical
patois. He indicated a footway leading
off to the left, and himself hastened
away in the opposite direction.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 39 -->

<div class="center" id="ch03">

<p>III</p>

<p class="small">LE PETIT CHEVALIER</p>

</div>

<p>THE inclosure in which the stranger
found himself was a large
one, comprising, as far as he
could judge, some twenty or thirty acres
of ground. A ditch filled with stagnant
water followed the line of the encircling
wall, its banks covered with a picturesque
tangle of vines and weeds&mdash;green despite
the season. A noble plantation of
forest trees&mdash;oak, pecan, magnolia, ash,
and cypress&mdash;bore away to northward
from where he stood; through their
trunks and downward drooping branches
he could see in the distance the ch&acirc;teau&mdash;a
dormer-windowed, high-roofed
house built of red brick, with many outbuildings
in the rear,&mdash;a green-hedged

<!-- page 40 -->

potager, and a sweep of orchards and
orange groves.</p>

<p>The path along which he turned, after
a brief survey of this semi-royal demesne
erected in a wilderness, pursued the course
of the palisade for several rods, then bent
at right angles toward a secluded garden
or plaisance.</p>

<p>This spot as he approached it gave him
an odd sense of familiarity, so exactly
had a bit of Old France been reproduced
in this remote corner of New France. A
natural avenue of superb live-oaks, whose
gigantic, wide-stretched limbs might have
sheltered a regiment of gendarmes, led
to the entrance gate, a low wicket of
wrought iron; beyond this the intersecting
alleyways were bordered and overhung
by pomegranate, sweet olive, and cr&ecirc;pe
myrtle trees; the inclosed squares were
set with cedar and pittosporum cut in fantastic
shapes, after the manner of Le
N&ocirc;tre,&mdash;here a lion couchant, there a

<!-- page 41 -->

griffin with outspread wings, at one turn
a columned arch, at another a flying
pennant. A life-sized marble statue of
Diana gleamed whitely in one rose-hung
recess; a large circular pool in the centre
of the main walk caught upon its motionless
surface the red rays of the lowering
sun, and shone like a great mirror
of burnished copper. On a sun-dial in
a parterre near by, a book&mdash;a Livre
d'Heures&mdash;was lying open and face
downward.</p>

<p>Absolute silence reigned in and around
this replica of a Louis Quatorze garden.
De Valdeterre walked the shelled paths
like one in a dream, his agitated soul
gradually hushed into profound peace,
the object of his coming hither dissolving
softly into oblivion. He drew a long
breath, inhaling, with the delight of a man
who has been mewed up for the half of
a year in an ocean-going ship, the elusive
perfume of unseen flowers, and bared his

<!-- page 42 -->

forehead to the wind, which had in it a
dewy hint of advancing twilight.</p>

<p>But as he passed into the open space
beyond this tranquil paradise, purpose
came back to him with an electrifying
shock. For from the doorway of a small
pavilion turreted like a toy castle, directly
in front of him, a man had stepped and
was coming rapidly toward him. The
blood surged into his pale cheeks, his
heart beat violently. He stopped, rooted
to the ground, like one suddenly turned
to stone.</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Vicomte de Valdeterre?"
The voice was low, vibrant, and harmonious;
it seemed to clear the mist from de
Valdeterre's eyes and restore motion to
his limbs. He doffed his hat, made a single
step forward, and greeted with a low
bow the enemy he had come so far to
seek. Then he lifted his head to fix his
eyes with a deliberate gaze on the face
so deeply graven on his memory&mdash;the

<!-- page 43 -->

broad forehead, the heavy black eyebrows
meeting above the long patrician nose,
the square jaw and compressed lips, with
their unsuspected tendency to part into
gayety or tenderness. What met his gaze
instead of this unforgotten face&mdash;which
should by now be old and seamed&mdash;filled
him with amazement. He saw the bright,
mocking countenance of a lad in his teens;
a pair of violet eyes surveyed him half
quizzically from underneath brown upcurled
lashes of extraordinary length and
silkiness; a mass of reddish brown hair
descended in waves over a pair of youthful
shoulders; the rounded cheeks were
fair almost to girlishness; the red smiling
lips were redeemed from effeminacy
only by the firm chin. The determined
poise of the head offset its tender grace.
A long gray cloak hanging from one
shoulder, with an end caught up over the
right arm, enveloped the slight figure,
but allowed a glimpse of the flowered

<!-- page 44 -->

coat and waistcoat and the lace ruffles of
the "elegant" of the period. A plumed
hat and a pair of riding-boots of fine soft
leather gave further jauntiness to the
lad's costume.</p>

<p>De Valdeterre fell back a pace or
two, gasping with astonishment, which
changed rapidly to indignation at having
thus been juggled with.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" he demanded
sternly, finding his voice. "Where is the
Chevalier de la Roche?"</p>

<p>"Softly, monsieur," interrupted the
boy with something like a saucy smile.
"Here is no riddle, I assure you. You see
before you the only and legitimate Chevalier
de la Roche"&mdash;</p>

<p>De Valdeterre made a movement of
impatience.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Sometimes known as le Petit Chevalier,"
continued the speaker imperturbably.
"My father, le Grand Chevalier,
who had the honor in 1734 of meeting

<!-- page 45 -->

the gallant Vicomte de Valdeterre in
honorable combat, met with a glorious
death one year ago"&mdash;</p>

<p>The listener uttered an ejaculation of
scornful incredulity.</p>

<p>The boy's face lost its smiling nonchalance.
"The Chevalier de la Roche," he
repeated with haughty insistence, laying
his hand on the hilt of his sword, "perished
in a fight with the Natchez Indians
one year ago, after having alone and unaided
killed the Great Sun and four of
his chiefs. If this news has not reached
Monsieur the Vicomte de Valdeterre in
his secure hotel in the Faubourg St. Germain,
it is because the exile's friends, and
even his family, remained uncertain of
his fate for more than the half of a year.
Besides," he added bitterly, "the death
of one prisoner more or less in the Bastille
or in the wilds of Louisiana is of
too small moment to disturb the air of
Versailles! How should a matter so insignificant

<!-- page 46 -->

as the snuffing out of a de la
Roche reach the ears of the king of France&mdash;or
his favorites?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said de Valdeterre
gently. "I could not have known.
I left France seven months ago. I&mdash;I
am sorry."</p>

<p>The Little Chevalier frowned and threw
up a hand as if to ward off sympathy.
"Monsieur le Vicomte de Valdeterre,"
he said after a slight pause, speaking in
his former careless tone, "I presume, is
prepared? The light of the 5th of January
is fading. Will monsieur have the
goodness to draw?"</p>

<p>De Valdeterre started. "I came hither,"
he cried with a quick return of anger, "to
fight with the Chevalier Valcour de la
Roche"&mdash;</p>

<p>"At the service of monsieur. I am the
Chevalier Valcour de la Roche," interjected
the Little Chevalier, saluting with
the point of his sword.</p>

<!-- page 47 -->

<p>&mdash;"With Valcour de la Roche," continued
the vicomte steadily, "the slayer
of my father, the celebrated duelist with
the wrist of steel, the hand of iron. I
did not cross the Atlantic to fight with a
boy."</p>

<p>"I am not a boy!" the younger man
burst out passionately. "And as to the
hand of iron and the wrist of steel,
monsieur will find to his cost that I have
inherited both from the Great Chevalier.
En garde, monsieur!" As he spoke he
wrapped a fold of his cloak around his
forearm and placed himself in position.</p>

<p>De Valdeterre continued to gaze at him,
baffled and disgusted.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," declared the Little Chevalier
tauntingly, "perhaps Monsieur de
Valdeterre, having waited already eighteen
years to discharge the debt of which
he wrote so bravely an hour or two ago,
would prefer to wait still longer. In that
case"&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 48 -->

<p>"The devil!" snorted the vicomte, infuriated
yet more by the lad's tones than
by his words. He ripped out his sword.
"Must I wing the boy?" he muttered
savagely between his teeth; "but what
can a man do? I am ready, monsieur,"
he added politely aloud. "And if"&mdash;</p>

<p>"And if"&mdash;the lad caught up the
word gayly, his good humor quite restored.
"And if the Chevalier de la Roche be
banished to yet more distant wildernesses
by His Majesty Louis of France, it will
not, at least, be by the fault of the Vicomte
de Valdeterre!"</p>

<p>De Valdeterre laughed in spite of himself.
"Perhaps"&mdash;he suggested significantly,
assuming his pose.</p>

<p>Again the quick response to an unspoken
thought flashed back. "Perhaps
this time it may be Valcour de la Roche
whose soul will fly out through a slit in
his lungs."</p>

<p>"God forbid," ejaculated de Valdeterre,

<!-- page 49 -->

involuntarily looking at the youthful figure
before him.</p>

<p>"Thanks," said the Little Chevalier
gravely. "Again en garde, monsieur."</p>

<p>The sword play began. De Valdeterre,
engrossed by the absurdity of his position,
paid slight attention to the thrust
and feint of his antagonist. A feeling of
shame overpowered him. "Is this," he
thought, parrying carelessly, "this the end
of my long agony of anticipation? <i>this</i>
the reward of all my preparation? Have
I sacrificed my youth, my ambitions, my
home, my native land for this&mdash;a mock
duel with a child, whose"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I had thought," the Little Chevalier
was observing, turning his wrist so that
his sword glided the length of de Valdeterre's
blade, "I had thought to see an
older man than monsieur."</p>

<p>"Why?" returned de Valdeterre with
perfunctory interest. "I am twenty-eight.
I was ten years old when"&mdash;He left the

<!-- page 50 -->

sentence unfinished, and a profound sigh
escaped him.</p>

<p>He resumed his inward monologue.
"A child! The thing is a farce! I will
presently disarm the boy and"&mdash;</p>

<p>"And an ill-favored," continued the lad
na&iuml;vely. Had de Valdeterre been a conceited
man he would have detected the
note of admiration in the young voice.</p>

<p>He did not reply. He found himself, in
fact, suddenly forced to abandon the languidly
defensive tactics he had hitherto
employed; a lively interest succeeded to
the apathy but now dulling his senses.
Why, the boy had evidently been trained
in the school of his father! There was
something almost abnormal in the quick
play of the supple wrist, the firm grasp
of the slender fingers. He turned lightly
about the vicomte, springing from side
to side, agile as a young squirrel, laughing
gleefully from time to time like a
schoolboy in mischief! De Valdeterre felt

<!-- page 51 -->

his own mettle rise; he was accounted
one of the most accomplished swordsmen
in Paris; and it was not for nothing that
he had anticipated all these years this
very encounter with a de la Roche. The
recollection of what he had come to do
at length blotted out the handsome young
face before him; he saw instead the livid
brow of his dead father; he heard above
the mischievous laugh his mother's despairing
cry. A berserker rage possessed
him; he pressed his adversary hard, forcing
him backward, inch by inch, watching
warily for the moment when the now
panting lad should give him the advantage
he sought.</p>

<p>Suddenly and without warning he felt
himself seized with a mortal faintness;
his knees trembled under him, a wave of
nausea swept over him, he shuddered from
head to foot. His long fast, joined to his
already enfeebled condition, and the reaction
consequent upon the painful excitement

<!-- page 52 -->

of the past twelve hours, had
done their work. He realized this and his
own powerlessness in one of those lightning
flashes which open fate itself to the
understanding. With a supreme effort
he made a lunge at the dancing form before
him. The impotent sword flew out
of his hand, carrying with it in its flight
through the air the plumed hat of the
Little Chevalier. He saw the boyish face
unaccountably pale within its aureole of
bright hair, and the blue eyes wide with
joy&mdash;or terror&mdash;upon him; then with
a roar of despair he dropped like a clod
to the ground.</p>

<hr/>

<p>IV</p>

<p class="small">SIEUR B&Eacute;B&Eacute;</p>

</div>

<p>THE returning senses, after a
loss of consciousness, seem to
traverse immeasurable distances.
Doubtless they do come back from some
remote unimagined world to which, free
from that inert mass they ordinarily inhabit,
they have sped on joyous wing.
For if, in an infinitesimal fraction of
time, the mind, clogged by the flesh, can
dart to the uttermost parts of the earth
and fetch therefrom treasures fit for a
king's ransom, is it not conceivable that
when "the soul has cast the dust aside"
it may journey to the farthest verge of
things known and unknown?</p>

<p>De Valdeterre's homeward flight was
accomplished slowly: laboring back from

<!-- page 54 -->

Saturn, perhaps, or Urania! He became,
first, dimly aware of a murmurous sound,
as of far-off voices that died into silence;
then of a touch on his forehead which
resembled the fall of a rose leaf. His
eyelids rested, heavy as lead, on his eyes;
he was too incurious to move had he been
able to do so. But his eyelashes stirred
imperceptibly when a single voice again
disturbed the silence. This time the
sound was nearer and more distinct;
he made a futile effort to recall where
he had heard those light, musical, mocking
tones.</p>

<p>"Nay," urged the unseen speaker
doubtfully. "You must be mistaken.
Look again, Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;. The thing is incredible.
And his thrust and parry so
gallant! I thought more than once, by
my life! that my father's heir was done
for."</p>

<p>"Hmp! And so by good right your
father's heir should have been, for playing

<!-- page 55 -->

the fool after so mad a fashion.
Done for, forsooth!" growled a second
speaker&mdash;if one can be said to growl
whose voice is pitched near the high C
and is thin-noted as a piccolo. "No, not
a scratch, pardieu. 'Tis naught but a
swooning-fit, I tell you. May the devil
fly away with a man who goes a-fighting
when by all signs he should be abed with
a sick nurse about! Thrust and parry!
Hmp. A feather-weight more of flesh on
Monsieur de Valdeterre's bones and you
had surely been slain. Had you no
thought of"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nay, Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;," interrupted the
first speaker a trifle haughtily, "you will
leave me out of the question, if it please
you. Not a scratch, say you? not a drop
of blood anywhere? I declare again that
the thing is inconceivable!"</p>

<p>"And I say again, may the devil fly
away with the imbecile who adventures
into a duel with his twelve ribs standing

<!-- page 56 -->

out from his body like the hoops about
an empty cask! Brrr!"</p>

<p>The last expression was like the string
which jerks a wandering kite to the
ground. De Valdeterre opened his eyes,
aware in a flash that this talk, which he
had heard idly, as one hears the lap of
waves on an outer wall, concerned himself.</p>

<p>He had, on the instant, the sense of
a vanishing presence; in truth he had,
later, in his mind the blurred vision of
a face, which was, and was not, like a
meteor at twilight. But his conscious
glance fell upon a wood fire in an open
fireplace; the leaping flames illumined
the brass fender, and tall fire-dogs, and
the twisted brass pillars which upheld
the high, carved wooden mantel above.
His gaze wandered mechanically around
the strange room; the walls were hung
with paper representing, in a series of
panels, a green deep-bosomed forest, with

<!-- page 57 -->

Greek temples in the background, and a
procession of nymphs winding in and out
among the purple-trunked oaks to the
music of the flutes and cymbals in their
upstretched hands. In the broad space
above the mantel the procession was interrupted
by a portrait hung against a
background of dark red; on either side
tiers of wooden racks held a varied collection
of weapons; the burnished hilts
of swords, the handles of daggers, poniards
and creeses sent out fitful gleams
of light into the gathering gloom. A
single pair of rapiers, holding as it were
the place of honor, were crossed beneath
the portrait. De Valdeterre paused in his
scrutiny of his surroundings to stare and
stare again at the face looking out from
the heavy gilt frame. At length over-wearied
with the effort of memory, he
closed his eyes and sighed heavily. At
the same moment a woman's voice somewhere
in the distance, old, thin, and

<!-- page 58 -->

quavering, began to croon; far away as
it sounded, he heard distinctly the words
of the familiar little hymn:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"<i>P'tit J&eacute;su, mon fr&egrave;re,<br/>

Oh, mon J&eacute;su si doux,<br/>

Il in'est rien sur la terre<br/>

Que j'aime autant que vous.<br/>

J&eacute;su! J&eacute;su!<br/>

J&eacute;su! dis lui que je l'aime<br/>

Toujours, toujours le m&ecirc;me!</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Ah! his mother, sitting on his bed beside
him in her white ball-dress, with his
hands in hers, had sung this as a lullaby
to her ten-year-old boy, her baby! the
very night before his father&mdash;Oh, but
he knew it now, that face!&mdash;the dark,
smiling face of the Chevalier de la Roche,
graven, as it were, with the point of
a sword on his youthful memory. He
groaned, turning angrily upon his pillow
to seek the portrait again. But this
time a figure standing beside the couch
obstructed his vision.</p>

<!-- page 59 -->

<p>The man looking down at him with
small, quizzical, twinkling black eyes was
almost abnormally tall,&mdash;a veritable Don
Quixote in height; not unlike the Knight
of La Mancha, indeed, in his general appearance.
He wore, it is true, the dress
of the time,&mdash;gay-colored coat and waistcoat,
small-clothes, and hose of silk, and
low, buckled shoes; but there was an exaggerated
cut to these garments, and a
fanciful addition of ribbon and lace to
sleeve and undervest, which gave an outr&eacute;
touch to his costume. His hair, slightly
powdered, was drawn into a bag wig at
the nape of his neck and tied with a parti-colored
ribbon; his long, lean face was
painted and powdered; the hands, over
which fell enormous ruffles of lace, glittered
with rings. De Valdeterre stared
at this singular personage as he had
stared at the portrait; then he lifted his
eyes to the huge damask-hung baldachin
of the bed and sighed again, like one to

<!-- page 60 -->

whom the key of a mystery seems hopelessly
lost.</p>

<p>"Monsieur revives? So? That is well!"
The high-pitched voice accorded marvelously
with the grotesque figure which
now bent over him. A hand was slipped
under his head and a silver cup placed at
his lips. "Monsieur will have the goodness
to drink," continued the stranger.</p>

<p>De Valdeterre raised a weak hand and
pushed the cup aside. "What is the
matter with me? Where am I?" he demanded,
his voice sounding thin and querulous
in his own ears. "And who the
devil are <i>you?</i>" he added involuntarily.</p>

<p>"Monsieur will have the goodness to
drink"&mdash;the shrill voice had become imperious.
De Valdeterre meekly gulped
down the contents of the cup,&mdash;a rich
tisane compounded of heaven knows
what liquors and spices; he thought that
in all his life he had never tasted anything
so delicious. Hardly had he drained

<!-- page 61 -->

the last drop when it seemed to him that
a fire began to course through his veins;
life flowed swiftly but painfully back
into his heart. He raised himself on his
elbow and looked eagerly at the man
whose face had regained its quizzical expression.
He opened his lips, but before
he could speak the other observed dryly,
"As to what ails monsieur, an effort of
memory will doubtless recall a certain
promenade in the garden of the Ch&acirc;teau
de la Roche. Monsieur is truly to be
congratulated on the outcome of that&mdash;promenade."</p>

<p>"By the holy saints!" cried de Valdeterre,
attempting to spring from the bed,
"whoever you are, you shall pay for this
insult, on the instant!"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not so fast, my friend," interrupted
the man, laying a hand on the vicomte's
breast and pushing him gently but determinately
back on the pillow. "It will
require another cup of La Temp&ecirc;te's

<!-- page 62 -->

famous tisane to put monsieur on his feet,
and still another to enable him to chatter
safely of another&mdash;duel."</p>

<p>The shade of irony in the curious voice
fairly maddened its victim. He lay panting
and glaring at the speaker, tears of
impotent rage forcing themselves from
under his eyelashes.</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Valdeterre," resumed
the tall man with sudden gravity, "if
you will but be quiet I will answer your
questions&mdash;since they are reasonable
and just. You met the Chevalier de la
Roche a short half hour ago in the plaisance
of the Ch&acirc;teau de la Roche"&mdash;</p>

<p>De Valdeterre covered his face for a
moment with his hands; the confused
mist at last broke entirely away from his
mind; the events of the afternoon stood
out, abruptly clear in the white light of a
shamed and miserable memory!</p>

<p>&mdash;"You were overcome, not by your
adversary&mdash;I hasten to say this in justification

<!-- page 63 -->

of the honored name of de Valdeterre,"
the high-keyed voice became curiously
kind,&mdash;"you were vanquished,
Monsieur le Vicomte, not by your antagonist,
who is, nevertheless, one of the best
swordsmen in the Province of Louisiana,"&mdash;de
Valdeterre reflected afterward that
the stranger had seemed here to elevate
his voice a little, and to glance furtively
toward the curtained recess behind the
tall headboard of the bed,&mdash;"one of the
best swordsmen in the Province," the repetition
was emphatic, "but by your own
physically weakened condition of body."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried the younger man gratefully,
"how I thank you, monsieur;" and
he poured out with frantic haste the
story of his illness, the long exhausting
days that followed, his vigil of the night
before as the Sarabande came slowly up
the Mississippi, his unbroken fast. "If
the Chevalier de la Roche but knew!"
he concluded sharply.</p>

<!-- page 64 -->

<p>"The Chevalier de la Roche shall be
informed." This time, despite the blur
which returning faintness brought to his
senses, the young man saw his companion
throw a glance toward the recess. He
felt sure from this movement that his
boyish antagonist was hidden there, and
the thought filled him with fury.</p>

<p>"No man," continued the personage
beside the bed in a didactic tone, "has
the right to enter fasting upon any important
emprise. Monsieur will have the
goodness to drink," he broke off abruptly,
stepping to the fireplace. He refilled the
cup from a saucepan simmering on the
hearth. This time the vicomte drank
obediently, albeit somewhat sullenly.</p>

<p>"As to the place-where monsieur finds
himself, surely that jumps at the eyes!
He was conveyed from the plaisance,
while still unconscious, to the Ch&acirc;teau
de la Roche"&mdash;</p>

<p>"My God!" Again de Valdeterre attempted

<!-- page 65 -->

to leap from the bed. Of course!
Idiot that he was, not to have divined
from the beginning that he was under
the roof of his enemy, now doubly his
enemy! In that enemy's very bed doubtless!
Shame and infamy! Leave it?
Yes! if the effort cost him his life!</p>

<p>These thoughts flashed like lightning
through his well-nigh disordered brain;
but the bony hand that once more pressed
him downward chilled his heart. The insistent
voice dominated his rage. "If
monsieur really desires to quit the Ch&acirc;teau
de la Roche&mdash;where, nevertheless, he
is welcome&mdash;he can do so only by remaining
quiet for yet a short while. If,
on the contrary, he wishes to lodge under
the roof of the Little Chevalier for an
indefinite period, attended through fever
and delirium by the household de la
Roche"&mdash;</p>

<p>De Valdeterre's eyes humbly besought
mercy; then closing them he gathered

<!-- page 66 -->

himself together, summoning all the
strength of his will for endurance.</p>

<p>"You see before you, Monsieur le
Vicomte," continued the speaker, as if
there had been no break in the information
given in response to his guest's
demand, but in a more familiar tone than
he had hitherto used,&mdash;"pardon, monsieur,
you will have the goodness to remember
that you have honored me by
asking me who I am. <i>Bien</i>. You see before
you Dominique Etienne de Betancourt,
prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the House of la Roche,
and <i>ma&icirc;tre de danse</i>, by appointment of
His Excellency the Marquis de Vaudreuil,
to the Court&mdash;that is to say, to the <i>haute
noblesse</i> of New Orleans and the Province
of Louisiana"&mdash;</p>

<p>This introduction with a backward
sweep of a spindle leg, a flourish of the
long arms, and a bow which brought the
fantastic face on a level with the vicomte's
own. A faint smile struggled, in

<!-- page 67 -->

spite of the gravity of his situation, into
the latter's eyes. It instantly disappeared
before a certain menacing dignity which
stiffened the bedizened figure before him.</p>

<p>"Sometimes known as the Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;,"
added the dancing master, with a second
flourish and a second bow.</p>

<p>"The Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;." De Valdeterre
echoed the words murmurously and essayed
a ceremonious salute with his hand.
The name conveyed no special meaning
to his ear. Had he been more familiar
with the chronicles of the Petit Versailles
he might, even in his present state of
anxiety, have looked with more interest
at an individual certainly almost as celebrated
there as the marquis-governor
himself.</p>

<p>Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;, now hard upon forty years
of age, had landed in the New World
from the same vessel which had conveyed
across the ocean from France and his
possessions the exiled Chevalier de la

<!-- page 68 -->

Roche and his family. A raw, gangling
youth was Dominique,&mdash;a <i>petit gentilhomme</i>
from somewhere about Rouen,
with an unmistakable bee in his bonnet
and an admixture of shrewd good sense
and warmth of feeling in his composition
but rarely found in the cynical world of
his day. He attached himself to the
chevalier with a humble but dogged persistence
which at first annoyed that ruined
gentleman, but finally gained him an intimate
place in his regard and a niche
in the slowly re&euml;stablished House of la
Roche. The chevalier amused his leisure
by conducting the patchwork education
of his raw follower, planting in the more
fertile patches of his erratic brain seeds
of learning of various and altogether incongruous
kinds; it was even currently
reported that the chevalier in the intervals
of fighting, building, intriguing, and
planting had himself, violin in hand,
trained the attenuated legs and awkward

<!-- page 69 -->

body into those graces necessary to a profession
of which the Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute; was the
sole representative in his majesty's southern
colony. The sobriquet bestowed upon
Dominique in affectionate derision by his
pupils, and under which his legitimate
patronymic had long since disappeared,
had come to be carried by him with a sort
of touchy pride, which was as ready to
resent any overfamiliar handling of it as
to welcome its utterance by those he conceived
to have a right to its use.</p>

<p>"Ma&icirc;tre de danse to the haute noblesse
of his colony at large," repeated
Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;.</p>

<p>He seated himself in an enormous fauteuil
and extended his legs to their full
length, his rosetted shoes resting upon
their red heels. "This, Monsieur le Vicomte,
is my profession. Nevertheless"&mdash;</p>

<p>At this point De Valdeterre felt rather
than heard a vanishing sound beyond the
headboard.</p>

<!-- page 70 -->

<p>"Nevertheless," emphasized Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;
complacently, "I am not without some
knowledge of the science of surgery and
medicine"&mdash;</p>

<p>"And the art of spices," suggested
his listener, with a sudden lightness born
of relief. "At least the insolent boy has
had the decency to withdraw," he muttered
under his breath.</p>

<p>Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute; nodded,&mdash;"And of the various
and sundry draughts, potions, and
elixirs known as tisanes, possets, balsams,
and cordials. The elixir, par exemple, of
excellent virtue for weakness, which you
have done me the honor to swallow, was
mixed by mine own hand, which hath a
modicum of skill both with the pestle and
the stirring-spoon. The recipe I had from
La Temp&ecirc;te herself the last time the
Grand Chevalier and myself, his humble
servitor"&mdash;he paused abruptly, glancing
from de Valdeterre to the portrait
on the wall. Then he crossed himself and

<!-- page 71 -->

hastened a third time to present the cup
to his patient's lips.</p>

<p>"The intimate connection between the
science of dancing and that of medicine,"
he resumed, "in the which latter is included
surgery, as in the former is incorporated
style, punctilio, courtesy, mode,
hath until now been slightly understood.
The world, as saith Plato the philosopher,
moves slowly." The tone had become
oracular. The speaker arose and walked
to and fro the length of the room, waving
his laced arms and keeping rhythm with
his words to the click of his heels on the
bare polished floor. "By the ma&icirc;tre de
danse, as by the chirurgeon, the bones
and muscles, the nerves and tendons of
the body, should be studied thoroughly.
Yes, monsieur. Otherwise how may the
knee be taught to curve, the foot to glide,
the waist to bend at a supreme moment
of the minuet, gavotte, or pavane? As
to the liver, which, as is well known,

<!-- page 72 -->

controls the feelings, misfortune to the
dancing master who understands not when
or how to administer the physic which
keeps that organ in order! Else&mdash;ciel!"</p>

<p>The vehement ejaculation was caused
by the sudden touch of a hand on his
arm. His back at the moment was toward
the couch. He turned to find his patient
standing beside him, his coat on, the cloak
which had been lying across the foot of
a claw-footed sofa over his arm.</p>

<p>The two men faced each other for a
brief interval in silence, the one dumfounded,
the other obstinate. Finally de
Valdeterre smiled.</p>

<p>"Your discourse, Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;&mdash;" he
began politely.</p>

<p>"De Betancourt," corrected his companion
stiffly.</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Betancourt, pardon.
Your theme is vastly instructive. I shall
hope at some future time to hear your
conclusions. At present, however"&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 73 -->

<p>"At present monsieur desires his sword
and his&mdash;passport," interrupted Sieur
B&eacute;b&eacute; with a complete return to formality.
"He shall have both. The elixir of La
Temp&ecirc;te hath done its work. <i>Bien</i>." He
fetched the sword from a recess into which
it had been flung, and assisted its owner,
whose hands still trembled a little, to
buckle it about his waist.</p>

<p>Then without further speech, but with
his hand under the vicomte's elbow, he
guided him out of the room and along a
wide hall lighted dimly by a swinging silver
lamp. De Valdeterre was irritably
surprised at the strength which seemed
to gather into his limbs as he walked; his
thoughts flashed back to the sunlit plaisance,
the red-haired, smiling boy, the
slithering sword blades; an impotent
longing possessed him. As if in answer
to his fierce interior cry, his companion
remarked as they stopped before the massive
cypress hall door:&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 74 -->

<p>"I must warn Monsieur le Vicomte
that the effect of the Indian potion is not
lasting, and the temporary vigor it gives
is followed by a corresponding lassitude.
A hearty meal on arriving at his lodgings
is imperative to Monsieur de Valdeterre's
well-being."</p>

<p>He laid his hand on the doorknob.
The gigantic negro, Achille, stepped forward
from the semi-obscurity of an alcove.</p>

<p>"Oui, Miche B&eacute;b&eacute;. Mo connais. Mo li
condi" (Yes, Monsieur B&eacute;b&eacute;. I understand.
I will conduct him), he said, smiling
intelligently.</p>

<p>De Valdeterre had divined the purport
of the brief instructions given to the
slave by the dancing master. The blood
mounted to his forehead.</p>

<p>"Pardon, Monsieur de Betancourt," he
interrupted haughtily. "I am in no need
of a guide&mdash;or of a guard from the
House of la Roche."</p>

<!-- page 75 -->

<p>"As monsieur pleases." Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;
threw open the door.</p>

<p>De Valdeterre paused a moment before
descending the steps. "Monsieur de Betancourt,"
he began abruptly, holding out
his hand, "to you at least I owe"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;, his voice
rising to its sharpest key; he ignored the
proffered hand. "Monsieur le Vicomte
will have the goodness to march, as if
the devil were at his heels, to <i>Le Veau qui
T&ecirc;te</i>&mdash;and his supper. If his legs fail
him and he tumble into a wayside ditch
and drown, or if a footpad relieve him of
his purse, so much the better for a pig-headed
idiot who hath gone fasting to a
duel! Brrr!" He slammed the door violently.</p>

<p>Night had fallen. A few stars were out
and straggling beams from the just-arisen
moon fell athwart the wide walk leading
to the tall gate in front of the ch&acirc;teau.
The gate opened, apparently of itself,

<!-- page 76 -->

and de Valdeterre passed out. He skirted
along the palisaded wall until he reached
the broken road which led to the rampart.
The Porte St. Jean, midway between the
turreted forts, was still open; soldiers
were lounging about the covered walk.
The sentry challenged him, as a matter of
form it would seem, for he waited for no
response from the stranger, but nodded
familiarly into the shadows behind him.</p>

<p>The outer streets of the town were
dark and deserted; the stranger, stumbling
uncertainly along the precarious
footways, presently heard behind him the
muffled tread of feet; he quickened his
own steps imperceptibly. A furtive
glance over his shoulder showed him in
a patch of moonlight the tall figure of
Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;, who was accommodating his
long strides to the younger man's now
labored step. He had quite evidently
constituted himself a safe conduct to his
patient and the enemy of his house.</p>

<!-- page 77 -->

<p>De Valdeterre smiled bitterly in the
darkness. "Henri Louis Nadan," he muttered
between his teeth, "truly thou art
to be felicitated on thy advent into the
New World! With thy formidable sword
on thy hip, the order of the king in
thy breast pocket, and thy eighteen years'
preparation for thy foe in thy hand and
heart, thou hast fallen like a log at the
feet of a green boy; thou hast lain like a
double log under the roof of the Chevalier
de la Roche; and thou art escorted
on thy triumphant return to thy domicile
by a crack-brained dancing master!"</p>

<hr/>

<p>V</p>

<p class="small">THE GOVERNOR</p>

</div>

<p>THE Marquis de Vaudreuil was
holding in the Government
House, at the corner of Levee
and Toulouse streets, the usual informal
reception which preceded the sitting of
the Superior Council. The great armchair
decorated with the royal insignia
of France, on a covered dais at the upper
end of the room, was unoccupied. His
excellency preferred for this function a
seat near the open window through which
the river breeze stole softly, bringing
with it a salt hint of the distant gulf.
The river itself, directly in front of the
Government House, and hardly a stone's
throw away, was hidden by Perrier's
levee, about which were visible the slender

<!-- page 79 -->

masts of innumerable sloops, brigs,
and brigantines. But by leaning forward
a little a curve of the mighty stream,
with its yellow breast sparkling in the
morning sunlight, came into view beyond
the bastions of Fort St. Louis.</p>

<p>"Oh! the monster is harmless enough
at this moment, I grant you," cried one
of the group of young men surrounding
the governor; "but when he shakes himself
and rises from between his poor pretense
of banks"&mdash;</p>

<p>"The fiery Gailliard, meseems, waxeth
poetic," murmured d'Hauterive, rounding
his eyes in mock admiration.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Why then," continued the first
speaker, passing the interruption by, "he
is capable of sweeping the whole of us,
bag and baggage, into the Mexican sea.
Now according to my plans and specifications,"&mdash;he
drew a packet of papers
from his breast pocket.</p>

<p>"Oh come, Gailliard!" protested half

<!-- page 80 -->

a dozen laughing voices. "Are we to be
drenched anew with the waters of your
canals?"</p>

<p>"Spare us this once, dreamer of dreams,
<i>pour l'amour de Dieu!</i>"</p>

<p>"Look you, Gailliard, I dreamed last
night that five gamins, and no fewer a
number of kittens, had been drowned in
your sluices!"</p>

<p>"A pest on your ditches and draw-bridges,
man! Carry them to the moon&mdash;or
to the farthest trading-post!"</p>

<p>"All the same," declared Gailliard, not
in the least disconcerted by these pleasantries,
and returning the papers to his
pocket, "all the same, it is a great plan.
If Monsieur Blond de la Tour had had
his wits about him, he might have drawn
it himself. As it is&mdash;a dreamer of
dreams indeed!" He broke off to scowl
a little, recalling the charge.</p>

<p>The governor smiled indulgently at
him. "Nay, Gailliard, lad," he said, " 'tis

<!-- page 81 -->

a pleasant phrase. Happy the man who
even at thy age can still dream dreams!"</p>

<p>It was apparent from the relaxed freedom
of his excellency's manner that he
was among his familiars.</p>

<p>The Marquis Philippe Rigaud de Vaudreuil
at this time was barely thirty
years old, though a review of the varied
events of his adventurous career might
have made him seem twice that age. He
was very handsome; his face was rather
a singular one; his eyes, of that kind
whose color seems to change with varying
emotions, looked out from beneath a
broad smooth brow, cut between the eyebrows
by a deep vertical line, which gave
a sort of ferocity to the otherwise genial
countenance. This note was repeated, as
it were, in the harsh lines about the pleasant
lips, and again in the square jaw
and muscular neck. The general bearing
of this favorite of fortune, though courtly
and elegant, was imperious; the well-nigh

<!-- page 82 -->

absolute power he had long wielded
aboard ship and in the colony had
stamped him with an air of authority,
which made him to those beyond his own
charmed circle as unapproachable as the
king himself. He exercised, indeed, the
prerogatives of a monarch in all that
immediately concerned that Little Versailles
in the heart of a wilderness, for
whose splendors and ceremonies he was
so jealous. For the rest, he was adored
by his friends; and he was both feared
and hated by his enemies, of whom he
had many both at home and abroad.</p>

<p>His stern justice and his somewhat
haughty generosity were equally proverbial.
But in the more intimate relations
of life he displayed a sunniness of temper,
a warmth of feeling, and a spontaneous
gayety which made him the idol of
the younger men with whom he delighted
to surround himself. The coterie of brilliant
and dashing officers, the men of

<!-- page 83 -->

brain and purpose, the dignitaries of
church and state who composed for a
matter of ten years his court in old New
Orleans&mdash;these have been immortalized
by the chroniclers of the time.</p>

<p>"Dreams sometimes come true, your
excellency," maintained Gailliard stoutly.</p>

<p>"Without question! Or so at least say
the poets. And when thou art the doge
of thy New Venice, Gailliard, and art
ready to espouse the Mississippi"&mdash;</p>

<p>He interrupted himself to take from
a salver presented to him by a liveried
servant a folded paper whose great seal
gave it the appearance of a state document.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Then I will myself give away the
wayward bride," concluded the governor,
breaking the seal and unfolding the
paper. He frowned as was his wont when
his rare moments of leisure were invaded.
The frown deepened as he read and reread
the single page; the contents plainly

<!-- page 84 -->

puzzled him. Suddenly a smile curved
his handsome mouth and spread over his
ruddy face; he broke into almost boyish
laughter and looked around the circle.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said, relapsing into
official gravity, "the Little Chevalier left
New Orleans this morning."</p>

<p>A movement of consternation in the
group pressing upon him followed this
announcement. Gailliard looked significantly
at Delaup, who was at no pains to
conceal his chagrin.</p>

<p>"But, your excellency"&mdash;began
d'Hauterive.</p>

<p>"Le Petit Chevalier," repeated the
governor with insistence, "left town at
daybreak this morning for the Ste. Catharine
Plantations,&mdash;on urgent business.
It is the request of Valcour de la Roche,"
he referred ostentatiously to the paper in
his hand, "that the name of the Little
Chevalier shall not be pronounced, or
even remembered, during this wholly indefinite

<!-- page 85 -->

absence&mdash;for state reasons.
This request, sent to us through the
hands of la belle Diane, becomes from
the present moment a command from
ourself. For state reasons, messieurs."</p>

<p>If there was wonder or curiosity in the
eyes of his hearers, it was cautiously
veiled; for when his excellency took that
tone, ma foi!</p>

<p>"And la belle Diane?" ventured Gailliard
des Marets, with another look at
Delaup.</p>

<p>"The beautiful Diane remains," returned
the governor gravely, "to illuminate
our f&ecirc;tes, and to set our young
men by the ears, according to her custom."</p>

<p>D'Hauterive again opened his lips to
speak. But as if divining what he was
about to say, the marquis repeated slowly
and a trifle sternly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You will remember to forget, gentlemen,
that my ward, the Little Chevalier,

<!-- page 86 -->

has gone into the interior on a mission
of importance, which forbids the least
mention of his name."</p>

<p>This sentence, spoken in a slightly elevated
tone, reached the ears of a young
man who, following the major-domo, had
entered the room. He paused just within
the doorway, as if from a momentary
timidity, flushing and paling by turns;
then he stepped confidently forward.</p>

<p>This newcomer was unusually attractive
in appearance. Tall, broad-shouldered,
well-proportioned, with a quick,
impetuous gait and a compelling manner,
he drew instant and flattering notice from
all eyes. His clear-cut face and deep dark
eyes, both rather melancholy in repose,
lighted with a sort of diffusing brightness
when he smiled. His fine figure was set
off to advantage by his quiet but elegant
mourning dress, cut after the latest Paris
fashion. He wore his own hair, slightly
powdered, tied with a black ribbon. He

<!-- page 87 -->

was still pale and emaciated from recent
illness, but his step was firm and assured,
his head erect, his voice when he spoke
full and clear.</p>

<p>"The Vicomte de Valdeterre," announced
the major-domo, with the precision
and expression of a machine.</p>

<p>There was a decided stir over by the
window. The advent of the vicomte had
already been heralded, and the curiosity
which concerned itself about any arrival
in the isolated colony had been sharpened
by the reports of the young nobleman's
wealth, his good looks, and his favor with
the king. No one present, except, perhaps,
the marquis himself, knew about
or recalled the famous duel of near a
score of years back, which had sent the
victor into exile denuded of his estates.
The men of a younger generation, indeed,
were unaware that the knightly de la
Roche, so powerful in life, so mourned in
death, had been under the king's ban.

<!-- page 88 -->

His rapidly accumulated fortune and his
growing influence had been winked at by
successive officials&mdash;who had benefited
by his service of sword and purse to the
feeble colony, or who had enjoyed the
friendship or the lavish hospitality of
the accomplished courtier. His enemies&mdash;he
had made not a few&mdash;doubtless
had spied upon him, but their reports had
produced no effect until such time as it
had pleased Louis, or La Pompadour, to
take note of them.</p>

<p>Among the Indians, who feared this
powerful leader, the chevalier was reputed
to bear a charmed life; his death
in a brilliant skirmish with a Great Sun
of the Natchez and his warriors had been
for a long time discredited by his red
foes. They declared that he had been
spirited away from under their very eyes
at the moment a tomahawk had split his
skull in twain, and that he bided his
time, awaiting his hour of vengeance, in

<!-- page 89 -->

Oy&emacr;-chi-chi-tah, a small, thickly wooded
island in the Mississippi River shunned
by the tribes with superstitious dread as
the abode of the "half-living."</p>

<p>Among his friends and compeers there
was also for many months a belief that
with his marvelous luck he had escaped
death, and might any day reappear out
of captivity&mdash;tattered, perhaps scarred
with new wounds, torn and emaciated, but
insouciant and debonair&mdash;as he had done
more than once in the past. The certainty
of his fate had come at length by a mysterious
messenger from the Chickasaw
woman known to the colonists as La Temp&ecirc;te.</p>

<p>All this, and a swift impression of that
long-ago duel whose details he vaguely
remembered, passed in a pained medley
through the governor's brain as the young
man approached him. He recalled the
fact that de Valdeterre was his wife's
kinsman, and himself the guardian of&mdash;!</p>

<!-- page 90 -->

<p>"Monsieur de Valdeterre!" he cried,
rising and extending his hand, "welcome
to this uncivilized attempt at a town of
ours, and thrice welcome among the forlorn
band of ascetics before you, who huddle
together for companionship on the
banks of the Great River! Gentlemen,
permit me to present to you my kinsman,
the Vicomte de Valdeterre of Paris,
France. Vicomte, Messieurs de Courcelles,
Le Blanc, de Pontalba, Gailliard
des Marets, d'Hauterive, Delaup, St.
Barbe"&mdash;</p>

<p>As he ran over the names of the gayly
dressed throng they saluted, each with
that dash of easy camaraderie which becomes
second nature to men drawn and
held together by the isolation of camp or
exile. De Valdeterre, whose self-love had
received so rude a shock during the past
twenty-four hours, felt himself suddenly
soothed and rehabilitated.</p>

<p>"Thanks, your excellency," he replied,

<!-- page 91 -->

bowing low. "Were I but admitted to
fellowship with such hermits, I should
relinquish Paris and forswear civilization
forever!"</p>

<p>His glance, sweeping around the circle,
made an imperceptible halt upon two men,
both standing near the marquis; they
were the same he had seen the day before
in the public room of The Sucking
Calf. As yet he was unable to disentangle
their names from the sparkling list
pronounced by the governor. Even in his
casual glance, however, he thought he
detected upon the face of the older
man a latent hostility to himself, veiled
under the bland, persuasive smile which
acknowledged the presentation. The
other and younger man had already laid
a friendly hand on his shoulder, and was
demanding gayly how he found himself
in the famous <i>apartemente</i> of M&egrave;re
Jacqueline.</p>

<p>A few moments of the light exchange

<!-- page 92 -->

of badinage which followed sufficed for
the desired information. The younger
man was Gailliard des Marets; the older,
who for some inexplicable reason had become
his own secret enemy, was Philippe
Delaup, under-secretary to his excellency
the governor.</p>

<p>The storm of eager questions concerning
the doings of that beloved Paris&mdash;hovering
ever in the golden distance of
every Parisian's dream&mdash;which assailed
the stranger, had but begun when the
folding doors were thrown open and Lubois
and Grand Pr&eacute;, king's lieutenants,
entered, followed almost immediately by
Belleisle, military commandant of New
Orleans, and Michel de la Ronvilli&egrave;re, intendant
commissary, the secret but relentless
enemy of the governor. Other
members of the Superior Council came
in, and the doors were closed. The marquis
dismissed his friends with a wave
of the hand, but he detained de Valdeterre

<!-- page 93 -->

to say, "Welcome again, cousin of
Valdeterre. You will dine at the Palace
this day en famille? No? Then to-morrow,
and the day after, and every
day, an it please you. There will be
much to hear and to tell. Apropos, Madame
de Vaudreuil, your kinswoman, receives
to-night. Do not fail to present
yourself."</p>

<p>The vicomte was on the point of excusing
himself on account of his mourning,
which he had worn somewhat less
than a year; but perceiving that the
marquis had already turned and was
walking toward the dais, he withdrew.</p>

<p>In the antechamber he found Gailliard
awaiting him. This place, which on his
arrival had been deserted, except for the
lackeys and the pages of the house, was
occupied by a score or more of men anticipating,
presumably, an audience with
the governor. De Valdeterre experienced
a lively curiosity as he surveyed the motley

<!-- page 94 -->

assemblage. Gailliard good-naturedly
proffered a word or two concerning some
of the more striking figures.</p>

<p>"Yonder beaded and feathered rascal
of a Tunica," he said, indicating an Indian
brave who stalked to and fro stolidly,
unmoved by the unaccustomed splendors
of the Great White Chief's wigwam, "has,
I would wager, half a dozen scalps hidden
under his dirty blanket"&mdash;</p>

<p>De Valdeterre uttered an exclamation
of horror.</p>

<p>"Oh," explained Gailliard na&iuml;vely,
"they are not the scalps of white men,
but of the Chickasaws or Natchez, with
whom we and our allies, the Tunicas, are
at war. The government pays one livre
the scalp. Half a centime the thousand
would be a juster price!</p>

<p>"The two men in the window seat," he
nodded pleasantly to them as he spoke,
"have a concession from his majesty on
the Mississippi below Pointe Coup&eacute;e.

<!-- page 95 -->

His excellency's late order to the planters
to build levees along the river front
has doubtless brought Duvernay and
d'Artaguette here to protest, or to beg
the loan of a hundred or so negroes to
construct their embankments."</p>

<p>A lean and wiry half-breed hunched
upon a bench had taken from a leathern
pouch a handful of stones, and was poring
over them with anxious and intent
eyes. "Worthless bits of lead and copper
ore!" observed Gailliard with a sting of
contempt&mdash;"from his excellency's so-called
mines. But what will you! The
king dreams of the riches of Golconda,
and the poor Province must needs try to
realize his visions! But come."</p>

<p>They shouldered their way through the
increasing throng, passing at the entrance
of the antechamber a tonsured priest in
the coarse robe of the Franciscan order.</p>

<p>"A message from his excellency of
Canada," remarked Gailliard carelessly,

<!-- page 96 -->

as if that far-away province lay just
across the river. "Whither away?" he
added as they descended to the street.</p>

<p>It had been de Valdeterre's intention
to proceed at once in search of the captain
of the Sarabande. Galled by the
ignominious failure of his hopes, balked
of his justly desired revenge, sick of himself,
he was determined to take passage
in the first outward-bound vessel for
France, there to forget, if possible, the
garden of the Ch&acirc;teau de la Roche; that
said everything! As for the <i>ordre du
roi</i> granting him the possessions of the
Chevalier de la Roche, that should remain
null and void. Let the red-haired boy
keep his father's unlawful gains! What
good would they do him, Henri de Valdeterre,
when the enemy who should have
groaned under their loss was cold in his
grave, and could not even know?</p>

<p>But he kept his own counsel with regard
to his plans, and presently he found himself

<!-- page 97 -->

at a table in a snug corner of one
of the private rooms of <i>Le Veau qui T&ecirc;te</i>
with his new acquaintance, who attracted
him strongly.</p>

<p>The bottle between them was hardly
needed to unloose their tongues; at the
end of a half hour they were exchanging,
if not confidences, at least opinions, with
the freedom of old friends. De Valdeterre
in the first pause, seized with a desperate
longing, made a bold plunge.
"Monsieur des Marets, may I ask without
indiscretion"&mdash;he began, but paused,
confused and embarrassed by his own
vivid recollections,&mdash;"will you tell me
something of the young&mdash;I mean of the
present&mdash;of the Little Chev&mdash;"</p>

<p>Gailliard leaned forward and touched
his wrist with an arresting finger. "Pardon,
Monsieur de Valdeterre," he said
gravely, lowering his voice, though the
room, save for themselves, was empty,
"the&mdash;person&mdash;after whom you were

<!-- page 98 -->

about to inquire left town this morning
for an indefinite stay in the country.
You will, I imagine, do well to remember,
like the rest of us, to forget the name and
even the existence of such an individual
for state reasons, by order of his excellency
the governor."</p>

<p>De Valdeterre bit his lip, listening to
this enigmatical piece of advice, but
bowed a silent acquiescence, having, it
must be confessed, heard it already from
the governor as he entered the council
room an hour or two earlier.</p>

<p>Gailliard, as if to ward off further
question, delighted, moreover, to have
what his friends would have designated
a fresh victim, plunged into a detailed
description of his great plan.</p>

<p>He belonged, it appeared, to the corps
of royal engineers, and he had long cherished
the idea of intersecting the town of
New Orleans with a series of navigable
canals, which, locked and gated, would

<!-- page 99 -->

serve as convenient waterways, drain the
water-sogged land, and avert disaster during
those terrible inundations from the
river, so dreaded by the inhabitants of
the young city.</p>

<p>He spread his maps upon the table
and drew his forefinger along certain
lines crossing and recrossing the parallelogram
indicating the town. "There
should be, according to my plan," he explained,
"a number of greater arteries
fed direct from the river, faced with solid
masonry, and provided with sluices and
drawbridges at certain distances. These,
properly, should come in at the head of
Custom House, St. Louis, St. Anne, and
Hospital streets. The intersecting waterways
would be on Chartres, Bourbon, and
Burgundy, or perhaps on each of those
streets which are parallel to the river.
Then instead of unsightly ditches which,
as you may have observed, at present
surround each block, we shall have

<!-- page 100 -->

broad rippling streams confined between
substantial walls of stone"&mdash;</p>

<p>The speaker's eyes sparkled as he proceeded
to describe the fairylike picture,
as if it hung before his mortal eyes. De
Valdeterre, tricked out of his sober
senses, caught the enthusiasm, and hung,
breathless as the engineer himself, over
the colored maps.</p>

<p>When, an hour or two later, he bade
his host good-by and crossed the courtyard
to his lodgings, he was almost light-hearted.
He hummed gayly under his
breath a strain of a new chanson current
in Paris, and walked with the careless
stride of one who is at ease with himself
and the world.</p>

<p>But at the head of the stair, beside his
chamber door, his forgotten Old Man of
the Sea awaited him.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 101 -->

<div class="center" id="ch06">

<p>VI</p>

<p class="small">A VISION OF THE NIGHT</p>

</div>

<p>"MY Old Man of the Sea!" The
thought arose unbidden to de
Valdeterre's mind at sight of
the towering figure standing motionless
on his threshold,&mdash;the black henchman
of the House of la Roche. "Yet, more
like a genie than an Old Man of the Sea!"
he muttered whimsically, smiling in spite
of himself; "and far more capable of
bearing me away between his invisible
wings than I of carrying him on my
shoulders!"</p>

<p>He took the note handed him with a
strangely caressing smile by the negro,
and passed into the room, where he found
Chapron sulking openly. The black, he
complained, who had come some hours

<!-- page 102 -->

earlier, had not only refused to trust the
letter he brought into his, Chapron's,
hands, but had threatened him, Chapron,
in his hideous jargon with instant dismemberment
if he ventured so near as
within reach of his huge fist! Monsieur
would do well to be on his guard. It was
beyond nature for a man's skin to be
black, anyhow; it argued acquaintance
with the devil!</p>

<p>The young man paid no attention to his
servant's warning growl; he had opened
the note. Hardly believing the evidence
of his own senses, he read and reread it.
It was, as he had expected, from the
young Chevalier de la Roche.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Vicomte</span>,&mdash;After all, it
proved to be neither the <i>if</i> nor the <i>perhaps</i>.
And I regret to say that at the
moment there can be no solution of
this problem, as interesting to you, I
take it, as to myself. I am unfortunately

<!-- page 103 -->

called away into the interior on urgent
business.</p>

<p>If, however, on my return,&mdash;of which
you shall be duly notified,&mdash;you find
yourself desirous of entering my garden
on the same terms as those agreed upon
yesterday, I shall be most happy to entertain
you there&mdash;<i>&agrave; outrance</i>, that is
to say, until the problem shall be finally
solved.</p>

<p>Meantime, my dear Vicomte, for reasons
which relate solely to my own affairs,
I trust to your honor to maintain absolute
silence concerning our late meeting.</p>

<p>I remain, dear Monsieur de Valdeterre,</p>

<p class="right">Most respectfully yours,<br/>

<span class="smcap">Valcour de la Roche</span>.</p>

<br/>

<p>"Impertinent young dog!" exploded
de Valdeterre with rage, pacing back and
forth with clinched fists. "How dare he address
me in this familiar fashion! He deserves
to be spitted like a cock-sparrow!"</p>

<!-- page 104 -->

<p>He forced himself to a semblance of
quiet, and returned by the hands of the
messenger the following curt lines:&mdash;</p>

<br/>

<p><span class="smcap">To The Chevalier de la Roche</span>,&mdash;Monsieur
de Valdeterre is honored by the
condescension of Monsieur de la Roche.
The longing of Monsieur de Valdeterre
to gaze again upon the beauty of the
garden in question is hardly to be restrained.
He therefore entreats the owner
of the said garden to shorten his absence
as much as possible.</p>

<p>The wishes of the Chevalier de la Roche
shall be strictly observed.</p>

<p>(<i>Signed</i>)<br/>

<span class="smcap">Henri Louis Nadan de Valdeterre</span>.<br/>

<span class="small">Jan. 6, 1752.</span></p>

<br/>

<p>"So, I remain!" he cried aloud when
the negro had saluted and retired. "So,
I remain. For boy or no boy, by the
memory of my mother, I will fight him&mdash;<i>&agrave;

<!-- page 105 -->

outrance!</i>" He brought his fist down
on the table heavily as he registered this
vow.</p>

<p>"Meantime, my dear Vicomte"&mdash;He
was again perusing the note, with the
vision of a red-haired boy dancing before
his eyes, and the memory of a smiling
face under the broad-brimmed hat almost
disarming his anger. "Saucy dog!" He
flushed for the hundredth time at the recollection
of the firm thrust, the delicate
feint, the bold sweep of the keen blade.
"But quite evidently his absurd varletship
is held at his own valuation in this
New Versailles, since the court is solemnly
charged by the governor himself to forget
the existence of Monsieur Valcour de la
Roche! So be it. But, my Little Chevalier,
I will await your return, and pardieu!
I will go and see you in your garden&mdash;though
I should never get out of it!"</p>

<p>The same night he came out of The
Sucking Calf, where he had supped alone

<!-- page 106 -->

in one of the upper chambers sacred to
the gentry. There was clatter enough in
the popular caf&eacute; behind him, but except
for a light in the guard-house opposite,
and the warning cry of a night watchman
making his first round with his staff and
his lantern, the streets and the Place
d'Armes at his right hand were already
dark and deserted, the sky was overcast
with clouds, the river breeze was freighted
with a chill moisture. He drew his cloak
more closely about him and walked slowly
along Rue Chartres, bent on getting a
breath of open air, and perhaps surcease
from bitter thoughts, before mounting
to his apartment. He paused in the
deeper shadow of the brick Church St.
Louis, and debated within himself as to
whether he should turn riverward and
see the Sarabande at her moorings once
more, or cross the town to the ramparts
and reconstruct in the obscurity that
Ch&acirc;teau de la Roche which had sheltered

<!-- page 107 -->

him the night past for a brief hour, and
which, he suddenly reflected, actually and
by order of His Majesty Louis XV. belonged
to himself, if only he chose to take
it. And by the gods he <i>would</i> take it!
Yes, and grind the House of la Roche
yonder to powder!</p>

<p>Opposite to where he stood was the
rambling, ch&acirc;let-like building which he
had noted on his arrival the day before,
the dwelling of the Capuchin monks, with
the large gardens and orchard spread out
in the rear. At his left hand stretched
that long narrow passageway between
Chartres (or Cond&eacute;) and Royal streets&mdash;at
the present day known as the Alley of
St. Antoine. It was then a dark and precarious
footway. De Valdeterre, the question
settled in his mind, was on the point
of turning into this alley, and so on to the
Porte St. Jean, when a light appeared at
its upper end. He stepped instinctively
back into the shelter of the church wall.</p>

<!-- page 108 -->

<p>The light, as he soon saw, came from
torches carried by a couple of negro men.
They walked slowly, their black faces obscured
by the resinous smoke from the
pine splinters. Behind these came two
other negroes, stalwart and broad-shouldered,
bearing between them a highly
ornamented but mud-bespattered sedan
chair; on the further side of the chair
strode a tall man wrapped in an ample
cloak and wearing a slouched and feathered
hat.</p>

<p>The watcher caught but a momentary
glimpse of this pedestrian, his attention
being immediately riveted on the occupant
of the chair. This was an ancient
dame of so fantastic an appearance that
he rubbed his eyes to make sure he did not
dream. Her shoulders were muffled in
parti-colored drapery, from which her
head seemed to arise to a prodigious
height. She wore, in fact, one of those
complicated and extravagant head-dresses

<!-- page 109 -->

known as the <i>fontanges</i>&mdash;edifices of ribbon
and hair surmounted by a peak of
lace mounted on brass springs, which
dated from the gayest days of Louis le
Grand. Her lean cheeks, seamed and
lined like a withered pear, were artistically
treated with red and white paint
accentuated with grotesque <i>mouches;</i> her
lips were artificially reddened, her eyebrows
blackened into coquettish arches,
from beneath which peered a pair of sharp
sunken eyes. De Valdeterre smothered
an incipient laugh. But desire of laughter
suddenly died of itself in his throat.</p>

<p>Immediately behind the sedan chair
came a second pair of link-boys, black as
charcoal; following them, on foot, picking
her way through mud and slush daintily,
as though across a meadow starred
with daisies, a maid. She was attended
by an elderly negress, turbaned and coifed,
who carried a bag containing, doubtless,
the slippers, fan, and other fanciful paraphernalia

<!-- page 110 -->

of her young mistress. The
girl's face, set about with the frills of a
great hood of flowered silk held out by
wire, shone like a star within the backward-blown
cloud of pine smoke from the
links; the hooped figure was entirely enveloped
in a cloak of brocaded silk, of a
pale pink color; but a white hand holding
the throat ribbons in place, and the small
feet in clocked stockings and chopines
were visible. An unaccountable thrill
passed through Henri de Valdeterre's
veins. He leaned forward, and drew
quickly back, the blood hammering his
temples and pounding into and out of his
heart, as the young woman turned her
shining eyes full upon him. Did she see
him, or no? He could not tell. She had
already passed on, but he could have
sworn that a mysterious half-smile had
curved her beautiful lips.</p>

<p>He heard confusedly a shrill voice directing
or reproving the sedan bearers;

<!-- page 111 -->

he stood rooted to the spot until the little
cort&egrave;ge skirting along the cypress fence
and locked gates of the Place d'Armes
had reached Rue St. Pierre and turned
riverward. He followed its progress by
the dancing lights, and saw it finally wind
around the corner of Levee Street and
disappear in the direction of the Palace.</p>

<p>Then, like one suddenly freed from
tension, he drew a long breath and walked
rapidly to <i>Le Veau qui T&ecirc;te</i>. There he
summoned Chapron and astonished that
not easily astonished individual by desiring
him to lay out his court dress&mdash;at
once.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 112 -->

<div class="center" id="ch07">

<p>VII</p>

<p class="small">DIANE</p>

</div>

<p>THE Vicomte de Valdeterre, having
made obeisance to his kinswoman,
the haughty and not too popular
Marquise de Vaudreuil, and having made
the tour of the salons on the arm of the
marquis-governor, found himself, about
eleven o'clock, standing with the dark-eyed,
vivacious Alys d'Hauterive near
the grand stairway in the hall of the
Palace.</p>

<p>The hall and the adjoining rooms on
either side, under the soft light of innumerable
candles in silver sconces and crystal
chandeliers, presented a scene of kaleidoscopic
brilliancy; in one salon card
tables were set out, and many of the older
men and women were hushed and eager

<!-- page 113 -->

over piquet, bassett, and other games of
chance; in another, gay young cavaliers,
ruffled, laced, periwigged, and powdered,
moved about, chapeau under arm, heels
clicking, saluting beautiful women in wide
paniers, petticoats of gold or silver embroidered
stuffs, buckled slippers, and
jeweled headgear. Lackeys in the Vaudreuil
livery passed in and out with silver
trays, offering to the guests in tiny silver
cups the spiced liqueurs appropriate to le
petit No&euml;l&mdash;Twelfth Night. From a
railed gallery overlooking the hall, where
the musicians were stationed, came the
slow, subdued strains of the minuet or
pavane. At the upper end of the great
salon, visible from where de Valdeterre
and his companions stood, Madame de
Vaudreuil, in magnificent toilet, was enthroned
in a chair of state emblazoned
with the arms of France, to receive the
homage of the miniature court. The marquise
liked to be treated <i>en reine</i>. The

<!-- page 114 -->

governor, on the contrary, for all his
punctilio in matters pertaining to his
position, could on occasion lay aside his
state; he mingled freely with his guests,
followed everywhere by admiring eyes
while he exchanged gay jests with the
men and addressed the women with the
highflown gallantry of the period.</p>

<p>The new arrival from the French capital
had been presented to many of the
latter; they had without exception bestowed
upon the stranger&mdash;whose good
looks were enhanced by his handsome
court dress&mdash;an attention which at another
time might have flattered his vanity.
But he was preoccupied; though
not, as he had been for the past day and
a half, with self-accusation and vain regret.
His eyes traveled furtively from
each hooped and powdered beauty he met,
in an unacknowledged search after the
face which had shone like a star through
a cloud of acrid smoke, the eyes which

<!-- page 115 -->

had shot him one swift inscrutable glance
from beneath a frilled hood.</p>

<p>He sighed softly, listening to the light
sallies of Mademoiselle d'Hauterive.
Suddenly he caught sight of the dame
of the sedan chair. She was seated at
one of the tables in the card room, absorbed
in play. Divested of her wraps
and in the full blaze of light, she appeared
more grotesque than ever. Her
neck, from which bone and tendon stood
out like veritable chevaux de frise,
thought de Valdeterre, and her skeleton
arms were bare, both blazing with jewels;
her stiff stomacher, long and pointed, compressed
her attenuated form and gave her
the look of a wooden effigy.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle d'Hauterive followed the
direction of the vicomte's gaze and broke
into girlish laughter.</p>

<p>"That is Madame de Ste. Hermine,"
she volunteered; "wonderful, is she not!
They say she came in with His Majesty

<!-- page 116 -->

Louis the Fourteenth. I know that she
figured in his court along with my own
grandfather when it was gayest. And
she continues to wear the costume which
his majesty admired three quarters of a
century ago. She also continues to ride
in a sedan chair because the gallants of
her time carried her links. Oh, hers were
<i>beaux yeux</i>, they say! She is half blind
now, and deaf as a stone; but she is the
best player at piquet in the Province."</p>

<p>De Valdeterre's tongue absolutely refused
to frame the question at its root.
He waited.</p>

<p>"She is the great-great-aunt of"&mdash;Mademoiselle
d'Hauterive paused, for
Gailliard had come hastily up.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Alys," he cried, "are
you forgetting the king cake? Ah, de
Valdeterre!" He reached a friendly hand
to the vicomte. "You are the man I was
looking for. Will you conduct Mademoiselle
d'Hauterive?"</p>

<!-- page 117 -->

<p>The vicomte gave his arm to the young
girl; they accompanied Gailliard to a large
room which ran across the rear of the
Palace. It was lighted like the others with
candles made of wax from the <i>anemiche</i>,
or candleberry tree, native to the region.
The high-backed chairs, the carved
buffets and cabinets filled with glass and
silver, suggested the state dining-hall.
Around the immense mahogany table in
the middle of the room were gathered all,
or nearly all of the younger element
which graced Madame de Vaudreuil's annual
F&ecirc;te des Rois. At the upper end of
the board, on an enormous silver salver,
reposed the remains of the gateau de roi,
or king cake. It was, or had been, a great
hollow brown circle sugared and fantastically
ornamented with colored <i>dreages</i>.
The Marquis de Vaudreuil was presiding
in person over the ceremony of the cutting.
Bursts of expectant laughter echoed
to the vaulted ceiling, as the young

<!-- page 118 -->

women advanced in turn and timidly, or
with assurance, cut with a silver knife a
small slice from the fateful ring. As de
Valdeterre and his two companions entered,
a girl was bending over her task;
there was a momentary but profound
silence in the glittering throng. De Valdeterre
trembled inwardly at sight of the
drooped head with its bright tresses entangling
the light. As she arose he beheld
once more, and this time in its full
loveliness, the face which had wooed him
hither, and which, until this moment, he
had sought in vain.</p>

<p>The unknown, a girl of nineteen or
twenty, was somewhat above the medium
height, of full yet slender and erect figure,
with arms and neck of dazzling whiteness.
Her face, a perfect oval with the
exquisite coloring of a seashell, was
framed by an aureole of auburn hair
wound in coils about a beautifully shaped
head; it shaded a low, broad, and very

<!-- page 119 -->

white brow. Her eyes were of that dark
violet-blue which at times seems velvety
black. The eyebrows and the long lashes
were dark; the mouth and chin were a
trifle haughty, but became exquisitely
feminine when, as now, a smile illuminated
her face.</p>

<p>A scarf of pale green gauze floating
from her shoulders was caught by jeweled
clasps to the paniers of the same
shimmering tint, which were looped
over petticoats of rose-colored brocade.
A half wreath of pink roses adorned her
head.</p>

<p>She stood smiling mysteriously with
downcast eyes, as if she breathed some
invocation while she crumbled the bit of
cake in her hand. For full half a minute
no one moved, the hush deepening around
her; the women bit their lips nervously,
the men leaned forward eager and excited,
each calculating his own chance in
case&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 120 -->

<p>All at once a little cry escaped her lips.
The bean, detached from the crusty morsel,
slipped through her jeweled fingers
and slid along her gown to the polished
floor.</p>

<p>Several men sprang forward; but de
Valdeterre had already stooped and picked
up the precious jetsam, cast at his very
feet,&mdash;a dark brown smooth sea-bean such
as is found along the Gulf coast,&mdash;and
was stepping across the intervening space.
Meantime a sort of genteel pandemonium
reigned. There was a simultaneous clapping
of hands, an irrepressible rush forward,
a chorus of exclamations in as many
tones as there were individuals present.
A repressed undercurrent of pique betrayed
itself in some of the feminine
voices.</p>

<p>"Bravo, Diane!"</p>

<p>"Reine ou rien, comme toujours!"
(Queen or nothing, as always.)</p>

<p>"Diane's luck!"</p>

<!-- page 121 -->

<p>"Whom will she choose, la belle Diane?"</p>

<p>The subject of the tumult stood perfectly
still, one hand resting on the edge
of the table, the other hanging by her
side. De Valdeterre, pausing before her,
bowed almost to the floor. A sudden hush
came again, like the stillness which follows
a storm; a pin dropping on the bare
floor could have been heard. From the
card room, undisturbed by the observance
of the old Spanish custom, came the sharp
echo of an angry ejaculation; the dreamy
tones of the violins in the hall stole in
and lingered like an undertone to some
fairy interlude.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Diane, you will make
your choice from among our young men,"
suggested the governor&mdash;it seemed to
those at his elbow a trifle nervously.</p>

<p>"Certainly, your excellency," returned
the young woman. She lifted her white
eyelids slowly and de Valdeterre flushed

<!-- page 122 -->

crimson as the velvet dark eyes looked
frankly into his own. La belle Diane hesitated;
it was but for the fraction of a
second, yet to all present, and most of all
to the vicomte, it seemed an eternity.</p>

<p>She put out a hand as if to receive the
bean, but laid her palm, instead, in his.</p>

<p>"You may keep the bean, monsieur,"
she said, "if it please you."</p>

<p>If! The blood whirled like a maelstrom
from his heart to his head. The deafening
tumult arose again; this time the undertone
of pique, and perhaps of something
more bitter, included male as well
as female tones.</p>

<p>If! De Valdeterre opened his lips, but
before he could utter a word he was stepping
out with the hand of the beautiful
Diane in his, at the head of a quickly
formed column. An order had been
transmitted from the governor to the
musicians in the gallery; they were playing
a slow and stately march.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 123 -->

<div class="center" id="ch08">

<p>VIII</p>

<p class="small">THE FARANDOLE</p>

</div>

<p>THE column&mdash;with its two leaders
hand in hand, but mute as marble
statues of faun and dryad&mdash;passed
into the hall, keeping time to the
music, entered the grand salon, where each
couple bent in courtly reverence before
Madame de Vaudreuil, wound its way in
and out among tables and card players in
the smaller salon, and passed, still with
grave, rhythmic step, out upon the broad
gallery facing the river and the glimmering
moon. Once, twice, thrice, back and
forth; the time had quickened insensibly,
the measure became faster and
faster yet as the dancers re&euml;ntered the
wide vestibule and swept again through
the dining-hall and the smaller reception

<!-- page 124 -->

rooms. The march had become a wild
galop; the gay length of the column
turned and twisted upon itself like the
shining coils of a serpent. The bosoms of
the hooped dames and the peruked gentlemen
rose and fell with the unwonted
exertion; the sound of their red-heeled
shoes on the parquet was like a patter of
hail.</p>

<p>Suddenly de Valdeterre felt a closer
clasp of the firm fingers on his own; he
lent himself, tingling, to the pressure
which guided him, deftly unnoticed, out
of the whirling coil. Looking at him for
the first time, Diane laid a finger on her
lip, with a sparkle of mischief in her eyes,
and drew him swiftly across a small anteroom,
through a curtained doorway, and
into a draped boudoir lighted by a single
shaded lamp. She released his hand and
threw herself, panting, on a sofa embowered
in palms, sweeping her skirts aside,
at the same time, in mute invitation.</p>

<!-- page 125 -->

<p>Some moments passed before either
found breath for speech. De Valdeterre
sat like one in a dream watching the rise
and fall of the beautiful white bosom
half revealed, half concealed by costly
laces, the turn of the firm chin, the curve
of the red lips. He was aware that the
flushed face turned toward him was like
one he had seen or known somewhere,
sometime. But he had no desire to trace
to its source the fleeting resemblance. It
was enough to look. Oh, to be able to
look forever!</p>

<p>In his life of twenty-eight years, which
had not been without adventures of many
and varied kinds, woman had until now
played but a small part. His mother alone
of her sex had influenced him. His whole
spirit, his whole physical being as well,
had been set to one goal,&mdash;vengeance on
his father's slayer; and the lighter emotions,
such as play around the lives of most
men, had not existed for him. But the

<!-- page 126 -->

supreme moment which comes to all had
come to Henri de Valdeterre, taking instant
and overwhelming payment for all
his past indifference. A new world had
opened before him, with whose divine
possibilities he felt the very air about him
charged. At once humble and exultant,
he longed to kneel at the feet of this exquisite
creature and kiss the hem of her
garments; he desired to sweep her away
like a master into some remote region
where they two might dwell together
alone.</p>

<p>Diane dropped her eyes before the mute
ardor in his and trifled nervously with
her fan. "My breath was gone completely,"
she said, in the slow rich voice
which, he thought rapturously, suited her
so well. "I am, in truth, unaccustomed
of late to f&ecirc;tes and festivals. I have been
nowhere before, since"&mdash;she paused and
her tone grew grave. "I have been in
mourning for my father," she concluded.</p>

<!-- page 127 -->

<p>"And I," said Henri, feeling this to be
already a sacred bond between her and
himself, "and I for my mother."</p>

<p>She bent her soft gaze on him. "It is
truly too soon for me to be out in the gay
world again," she continued musingly and
as if to herself; "but I am here by the
express wish, which is a command, of
the Marquis de Vaudreuil."</p>

<p>"Neither did I desire or intend to
come," de Valdeterre hastened to say,
"until I saw"&mdash;he arrested himself,
confused. To cover his embarrassment
he took the bean from his waistcoat
pocket and regarded it intently, lying in
the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>"So, mademoiselle," he said gayly, "I
am your king by the grace of the Epiphany.
And you are"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle de la Roche," said a
sneering voice at the door, and Philippe
Delaup, parting the curtains, stepped into
the boudoir.</p>

<hr/>

<p>IX</p>

<p class="small">HEREDITARY FOES</p>

</div>

<p>DE VALDETERRE'S pale face
grew livid; he recoiled as if he
had received a mortal blow. But
partly mastering himself, he arose to his
feet and stood looking down at the young
girl who kept her place, lifting questioning
eyes to the intruder.</p>

<p>"Pardon, mademoiselle," said the vicomte,
in a voice which despite effort betrayed
his agitation. "In the excitement
of the farandole, no one has done me the
honor to present me. Permit me therefore
to present myself. Mademoiselle, I
am Henri de Valdeterre." His bow, like
his tone, was formal.</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Valdeterre," Diane
sprang to her feet and swept him an exaggerated

<!-- page 129 -->

reverence, "permit me, in my
turn, to make myself known. Monsieur,
I am Diane de la Roche."</p>

<p>She fronted him with a girlish expectant
laugh, which died into silence before
his continued gaze; a pleading look
dawned into her lovely eyes. They remained
there facing each other for a moment,
Delaup glancing from one to the
other with half-veiled enigmatical eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly Diane's tall figure stiffened,
her head went up proudly, a disdainful
smile parted her lips. She placed the tips
of her fingers on Delaup's proffered arm
and quitted the room without even so
much as a backward glance.</p>

<p>De Valdeterre remained, he knew not
how long, in the perfumed and dimly
lighted nook where a new and glorious
world had leaped out of space to his hand,
and where that world had crumbled into
dust. A storm raged in his breast and
shook him, physically, from head to foot.

<!-- page 130 -->

At first he could see nothing clearly in
the chaos which reigned in his soul; horror
possessed him at length to find that
he was overwhelmed not so much by the
knowledge that he, de Valdeterre, had
made merry, as it were, over the dead
body of his father with the daughter of
that father's assassin as that he himself
had sought to slay the father of Diane de
la Roche, and had actually lifted a murderous
hand against her brother!</p>

<p>For now, indeed, he tracked the fleeting
resemblance to its spring, and he groaned
as he remembered how exactly the boy's
arrogant upthrow of the head chimed
with the same movement on the girl's
part; how the face, though not the same,
was yet in truth the very same&mdash;only a
thousand times more lovely, softer, more
feminine and graceful. The same glint,
as of sunset, in the abundant hair; the
same witchery of eye and of speech.</p>

<p>"Surely, I am but the plaything of

<!-- page 131 -->

some grotesque and terrible fate," he
muttered; "and nothing is left for me
but to fly fate&mdash;and Diane&mdash;at once
and forever!"</p>

<p>As he glided unnoticed through the
hall to the front entrance of the Palace,
a glance into the card room showed him
the sphinx-like Madame de Ste. Hermine
surrounded by an excited group of men
and women. She was talking in a high,
quavering voice&mdash;he had heard it already
at the Ch&acirc;teau de la Roche crooning
the lullaby his mother used to sing.
Instinct as well as reason told him that
the venerable court favorite of Louis the
Magnificent, banished from her beloved
Paris by the exile of the head of her
family, the Chevalier de la Roche, was relating
the story of the duel in the <i>clos</i>,
and the consequent enmity of the great
houses of la Roche and Valdeterre.</p>

<p>In the greater salon beyond, he had a
glimpse, to remain graven forever on his

<!-- page 132 -->

memory, of Diane, stepping a minuet with
Delaup to the slow strains of almost
ghostly delicate music. One small hand
held up the voluminous skirts, freeing the
daintily clad feet for their stately movements;
her red lips were parted, her eyes
sparkled, a bright color had flamed into
her cheeks.</p>

<p>From a coign of vantage over against
the dancers, Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;, in the full glory
of ribbon, lace, and brocade, towering
above the onlookers, was beating time inaudibly
with his bony hands.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>The governor, at midnight, called loudly
for de Valdeterre; his excellency was
unaware until later of the contretemps
which had hurried his kinsman away from
the F&ecirc;te des Rois; he had, nevertheless,
feared some such contretemps from the
moment his ward had signified her intention
of obeying the summons, issued before
the vicomte's arrival.</p>

<!-- page 133 -->

<p>He desired the young man to assist
at the concluding ceremony of the f&ecirc;te.
This was the manumission, according to
an accepted custom of the Epiphany, of
one of his slaves. Standing at the upper
end of the grand salon, with his hand on
the jeweled hilt of his sword, he awaited
the appearance of the favored black who
entered a slave, awed and trembling in
every limb, and who went out a free
<i>homme de couleur</i>. The fortunate chattel
on this occasion was a man long past middle
life, whose face was scarred with
marks of servitude; he knelt before his
master, rolling the while fearful eyes toward
the disapproving countenance of
his mistress, and kissed the governor's
feet, one after the other, in token of submission
and gratitude. Terrified by the
clapping of hands which followed the
words pronouncing him his own master,
he sprang up and fled like a hounded
deer from the room.</p>

<!-- page 134 -->

<p>The same night, it may be recorded in
passing, before setting out for the f&ecirc;te,
Diane de la Roche had bestowed the
priceless boon of freedom on her major-domo,
Achille, who nevertheless prayed
to be allowed to remain in her service.</p>

<p>"Our cousin of Valdeterre"&mdash;began
the marquis on taking leave of his ward a
little after midnight.</p>

<p>"The Vicomte de Valdeterre, may it
please your excellency," interrupted Diane
icily, "is the hereditary enemy of
our House. He is, moreover, a most disagreeable
person. I wonder that your
excellency should have allowed me to
remain in ignorance as to who was my
partner in the farandole."</p>

<p>"Oh, these women! these women!"
murmured the great marquis, following
her retreating figure with half-vexed,
half-amused eyes, and thinking, doubtless,
of his own haughty and capricious
spouse.</p>

<hr/>

<div class="center" id="ch10">

<p>X</p>

<p class="small">BEHIND THE PORTI&Egrave;RE</p>

</div>

<p>THREE months had elapsed since
Henri de Valdeterre had set foot
on the shores of a new world.
During this time he had ceased to be a
stranger; he had become a leading figure
in the gay court of the grand marquis.
His romantic history, as told by Madame
de Ste. Hermine, and supplemented
by fragments of recollection dragged to
light from the memories of older colonists,
had but increased the popularity
won by his appearance, his open-handed
generosity, and his courteous and elegant
address. The accident which had made
him at the F&ecirc;te des Rois the partner
of the beautiful Diane de la Roche had
been at the time a nine-days' wonder;

<!-- page 136 -->

the Little Versailles had buzzed with it;
it had been the basis of a hundred extravagant
wagers, and at least one serious
encounter, among Diane's followers, who
by a tacit understanding ranged themselves
in a solid phalanx, as it were, between
that injured young woman and the
man who had, albeit unconsciously, insulted
her by even so much as touching
the tips of her pretty fingers.</p>

<p>All sorts of reasons were alleged for the
presence of de Valdeterre in New Orleans,&mdash;one
at least coming marvelously near
the truth: that which claimed that he had
come to take possession, governor or no
governor, in the name of the crown, of
the unlawfully acquired property of the
late Chevalier de la Roche. As no hint
escaped his own lips of the royal order
lying half forgotten in his desk, or of the
more sinister motive which had prompted
his voyage, the stir, except so far as concerned
his personal relations with Mademoiselle

<!-- page 137 -->

de la Roche, gradually died away.
He was accepted as one of those gentlemen
adventurers who at that period
sought in the New World excitement for
its own sake, at the cost of purse, sword,
and even life. He continued to live at The
Sucking Calf, where in the apartment of
M&egrave;re Jacqueline, refurnished by Chapron
to suit the exigencies of its new
occupant, he entertained at cards, wine,
and gossip, after the fashion of his age.</p>

<p>It was a period of great splendor in
the young city. The Marquis de Vaudreuil
and his ambitious wife left far
behind them the almost republican simplicity
of their predecessors, Bienville
and Perrier. Though harassed by exorbitant
demands from the crown, cramped
by want of funds for his growing government,
troubled by continual disturbances
on his frontier by savage hordes of
Natchez, Chickasaws, and other turbulent
Indian tribes, and further made uneasy

<!-- page 138 -->

by the machinations of his intendant Ronvilli&egrave;re,
the marquis yet contrived to find
time and heart for the routs, balls, and
pageants, in and out of door, which have
left so golden a memory, to this day, in
the French heart of the old town.</p>

<p>In all of these, both his kinsman and
his ward bore a conspicuous part; Diane
surrounded by her band of adoring cavaliers,
always radiant, always disdainful,
and often openly hostile to the man she
was pleased to term her hereditary foe;
de Valdeterre on his part apparently oblivious
of the presence even of his fair
enemy, paying assiduous court to other
demoiselles of the circle, notably Mademoiselle
d'Hauterive. And if chance,
or the wave of advancing or retreating
contredanse or promenade brought them
within reach of each other, there was instant
and ostentatious pressing forward
of his or her friends to prevent an untoward
meeting.</p>

<!-- page 139 -->

<p>"There is blood between them!" The
phrase uttered oracularly in the very beginning,
perhaps by Madame de Ste. Hermine
or Delaup, had been accepted as a
sort of watchword.</p>

<p>De Valdeterre, yielding to the situation
with outward calm, was inwardly
confused and perplexed by his own tumultuous
emotions. He told himself incessantly
that he remained in Louisiana,
spite of Fate, for the sole purpose of one
day paying a second visit to the Little
Chevalier in his garden; to this he was
bound in honor. As for Diane, he assured
himself twenty times a day that he hated
her with a fervor proportioned to the
intensity of his brief moment of infatuation
in the curtained boudoir at the
Palace. Yes, he hated Diane de la Roche;
there was blood&mdash;his father's blood&mdash;between
them. Yet he could not put her
out of his thoughts; wherever he went
he saw her only, heard only her gay

<!-- page 140 -->

laugh, listened for her rich, slow voice,&mdash;at
the daily promenade on the levee,
in the Place, at church or Palace; over
the card table, in the <i>salle d'&eacute;scrime</i>
above the jingle of glasses, the clatter
of blades, the swagger of oath or drinking-song,
his mind turned, like a lost
child, around the charmed spot where she
stood, radiant, smiling, insolent, hostile.
Oh yes, he hated her! And when he
should have crossed swords once more
with her brother&mdash;he laughed aloud at
thought of the red-haired lad in his
plumed hat, with his sister's saucy eye
and her mettled upthrow of the head&mdash;why
then, back to France, and good-by,
God be praised! to Diane de la Roche.</p>

<p>But until the Little Chevalier saw fit
to return&mdash;!</p>

<p>For many reasons besides the command
of the governor, and Gailliard's warning,
he had refrained studiously from making
any inquiry concerning the absent boy.

<!-- page 141 -->

Once or twice, finding himself near the
dancing master, he had almost put a
question. But the Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;, as if divining
his intention, had as often stalked
away, though not without exchanging a
look of secret and not unfriendly intelligence
with his quondam patient.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his life in the colony had
become filled with other interests, which
kept pace, after a fashion, with these
secret emotions. He was much with his
kinsman, the governor, and learned somewhat
of the interior workings of the
government, the quarrels and wranglings
which lent zest to the sittings of the
council, the intrigues and the plots within
plots which gave to the Little Versailles
a curious likeness to the greater Versailles
at home. Besides, he carried in his head
several unsolved problems.</p>

<p>For example, there was Delaup.</p>

<p>His apartment at The Sucking Calf
comprised an anteroom, an alcoved bedchamber,

<!-- page 142 -->

which also served as a sitting-room,
the sleeping-closet of his valet;
and a small cabinet where he had stored
his hunting paraphernalia, his portmanteau
and traveling-chest, and other odds
and ends not in daily use. The cabinet
was reached by a long, narrow passageway
leading out of his bedchamber.</p>

<p>One night, at a late hour, he traversed
the passage without a light, knowing
that he could in the dark lay his hand
upon the object wanted, a case of hunting-knives.
He stopped short as he
pushed open the unfastened door of the
cabinet, arrested by a single line of light
on the wall opposite, vivid in the darkness.
He stepped cautiously across the
small room; the light lay along a heavy
curtain which hung before a door, barred
and bolted on the hither side. There was
without doubt a room beyond, occupied
at the moment; for he heard the murmur
of a voice or voices. He moved noiselessly

<!-- page 143 -->

back, stooping and groping among
boxes and bales for the case of knives;
but as he arose he heard, or thought he
heard, his own name, uttered in a tone
which seemed familiar. He drew the
porti&egrave;re softly aside; the door, shrunken
from the jamb, had left on one side a
slit-like opening a couple of inches wide.
His eyes, glued to this crack, fell upon a
table lighted by a single candle, in a tall
candlestick, in the middle of a fair-sized
room. A litter of papers&mdash;letters opened
and unopened, loose sheets, notebooks,
memoranda, and the like&mdash;strewed the
table, upon one end of which a small tea-pot
steamed over the blue flame of an
alcohol lamp. A man in an armchair
was leaning forward reading a letter, his
large face illuminated by a smile of satisfaction.
He was quite alone, in his
shirt sleeves, like a man in his own
house.</p>

<p>"Delaup!" breathed de Valdeterre,

<!-- page 144 -->

dropping the curtain and starting back
abashed.</p>

<p>"What tricks the imagination can play
one," he muttered, once more in his own
room. "I could have sworn I heard him
pronounce my name!"</p>

<p>The scene haunted him. "Where are
Delaup's lodgings?" he asked carelessly
of Gailliard later.</p>

<p>"Delaup? He lives in his own house in
Toulouse Street, a very handsome house,
by the way. Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing!&mdash;Then what the devil
was he doing after midnight, alone, in
Rue St. Pierre?" The last query was an
unuttered one. Thus the still-unsolved
Problem Delaup had had its beginning.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 145 -->

<div class="center" id="ch11">

<p>XI</p>

<p class="small">A MORNING RIDE</p>

</div>

<p>ONE morning, in the early days of
April, Gailliard invited his fast
friend the Vicomte de Valdeterre
to accompany him on an inspecting tour
up the Tchoupitoulas Road, the young
engineer having in charge the work on
the growing levee above the city. The
two rode booted and spurred, from the
government barracks, along Levee Street
by Government House and the Palace,
past the handsome private residence belonging
to Bienville, late the governor of
Louisiana, now in France in semi-disgrace&mdash;an
exile from the town he had
founded; and so on, through the Porte
St. Louis beside the fort of the same
name.</p>

<!-- page 146 -->

<p>The road, a rusty weed-fringed track,
ran between the river and the indigo
plantations of the Jesuits, which lay without
the city and beyond the terre commune
bordering the upper rampart; the
fields, blue-green with springing crops,
were picturesque with turbaned negro
slaves&mdash;men and women, who moved under
the whip of overseers up and down
the rows of young plants, or around the
open vats, chanting weird, unintelligible
refrains. There were a few Indians among
them, stolid, silent. "Scornful alike of
white master and black slave," remarked
Gailliard, "and revolting against labor
from their scalp-locks to their red heels!"</p>

<p>"Then why&mdash;?" began de Valdeterre.</p>

<p>"Firewater," interrupted Gailliard sententiously.</p>

<p>The river under the clear sky, sparkling
in the brilliant sunshine, rolled majestically
gulfward, tranquil and seemingly
content.</p>

<!-- page 147 -->

<p>But the engineer pointed out to his
companion signs of an approaching flood;
the frothy eddies lapping the grass-grown
levee were burdened with drift; enormous
logs shot into air in midstream,
stood upright for a moment and plunged
back into the tawny depths; here and
there beyond the line of levees projecting
headlands, miniature peninsulas, crumbled
silently, or dropped bodily with a
heavy splash into the swirl.</p>

<p>"By heaven!" exclaimed Gailliard as
they continued their course up the riverside,
after an examination of the levee-work
going forward under the direction
of his subordinates; he rose in his stirrups
and gazed long and earnestly at
this mysterious Mississippi for which de
Valdeterre had come to have a respect
bordering upon awe. "I tell you, Henri,
the monster is capable of sweeping us all,
bag and baggage, into the Mexican sea"&mdash;this
was Gailliard's favorite formula.

<!-- page 148 -->

"If the Superior Council, dolts and cabbage-heads
as they are, would only&mdash;even
at this late day, consider my plan!"</p>

<p>The good fellow, according to his wont,
builded dream after dream upon the airy
buttresses he had contrived, until his new
Venice shone a dazzling city under the
horizon of his imagination.</p>

<p>De Valdeterre listened indulgently,
looking now at the ardent speaker and
now at the river, but oftener into the
unfathomable depths of the swamp at
his right hand. For all signs of habitation
were now left far behind; the great
cypresses, hung with long streamers of
funereal moss, stood knee-deep in a black
sea, on whose still surface water lilies,
gold-centred, and spidery bayou lilies
gleamed supernaturally white; clumps of
fanlike lataniers indicated higher spots
of ground in the morass, where dry footing
might be had by hunter or fisherman.</p>

<p>"Dangerous places, these <i>cypri&egrave;res</i>,"

<!-- page 149 -->

Gailliard interrupted his rhapsody to observe.
He reined in his horse as he spoke.
"By the way, it was hereabouts, if I
remember aright; yes, yonder is the
very spot"&mdash;he pointed with his riding-whip
toward a black lily-starred pool under
the drooping moss-hung branches of
a water oak&mdash;"the very spot where the
Chevalier de la Roche killed the alligator
known as Le Vieux, which they say had
baffled Indian hunters for a century; an
enormous beast. His skin hangs on the
de la Roche library wall&mdash;Oh, I beg your
pardon, de Valdeterre!" His face reddened
guiltily. "I had forgotten."</p>

<p>"No offense, my dear Gailliard," returned
the vicomte frankly. There was
a suppressed eagerness in his tone as he
continued, "On the contrary, you would
oblige me by telling me something of the
chevalier&mdash;le Grand, I mean. I have no
motive beyond curiosity in asking," he
added hastily. "Only, as you know, the

<!-- page 150 -->

subject de la Roche is avoided in my
presence as if it were a deadly poison."</p>

<p>"Naturally," admitted Gailliard with
a dry smile. "There is, after all," he
began as they resumed their promenade,
"but little to tell. The chevalier's advent
in the Province antedates my time, though
I knew him later, and, like all who came
in contact with him, I admired him extravagantly.
If I say anything which is
disagreeable to you, Henri, you will do
me the justice to remember that you have
brought it upon yourself."</p>

<p>"Pray proceed," urged his listener,
smiling.</p>

<p>"The Chevalier de la Roche, it seems,
reached Louisiana accompanied by his
kinswoman, Madame de Ste. Hermine&mdash;the
Lady &agrave; la Fontange, you know,"&mdash;De
Valdeterre nodded,&mdash;"and his two
children. He was not, as you may suppose,
entirely penniless, although the
confiscation of his estates and the

<!-- page 151 -->

<i>lettre de cachet</i> followed hard upon&mdash;upon"&mdash;</p>

<p>"The duel," suggested de Valdeterre.</p>

<p>"&mdash;Still he had many and powerful
friends who doubtless supplied him with
funds. At any rate, he quickly acquired
property, and became at once a power in
the colony. He was generous to a fault,
hospitable, hot-headed, reckless, brave,
loyal&mdash;a <i>preux chevalier</i>, in every respect,
I tell you, de Valdeterre!"</p>

<p>"He was my father's friend before he
was my enemy," said the vicomte.</p>

<p>Gailliard proceeded to account in glowing
terms the various adventures of the
Chevalier de la Roche,&mdash;on the dueling-ground,
at the gaming-table, in the Superior
Council, where his voice and his
purse had uncommon weight, and among
the Indians. He had been greatly feared
by the red foes of the Province, especially
by those powerful and warlike
tribes the Natchez and the Chickasaws;

<!-- page 152 -->

more than once he had detected and defeated
their murderous plots&mdash;aided, it
is said, by a princess of the Chickasaws
called by the French La Temp&ecirc;te,
who was known to be tenderly attached
to the chevalier. Many were the thrilling
combats he had had with these savage
warriors before he met death at
their hands. He was accompanied on
all these expeditions by a negro slave
named Achille, a sort of body-servant
and major-domo of his household; and
often also by that extraordinary personage,
the crack-brained caperer, Sieur
B&eacute;b&eacute;.</p>

<p>Gailliard related the story of the chevalier's
last fight, and of the mystery which
for a long time had surrounded his death
and burial.</p>

<p>"Poor Diane!" he concluded. "She
refused for months to believe that her
father had been killed; it was only when
Achille returned with a token from La

<!-- page 153 -->

Temp&ecirc;te herself that she abandoned
hope."</p>

<p>They rode on some moments in silence
after Gailliard had uttered the last
words. "Ah, Henri," he began again abruptly,
as if following out some train of
thought, "you are lucky!&mdash;you who are
beyond the reach of Diane de la Roche's
coquetry. Happy the man who is her
hereditary foe!" He laughed, but ruefully
and half-heartedly.</p>

<p>"Yes," he went on in answer to a look
of surprised inquiry from his companion,
"I have scorched in that flame&mdash;who
has not? Capricious, haughty, cruel,
careless, lovely Diane! Continue to hate
her, my friend. It is far safer than to
love her."</p>

<p>De Valdeterre sought in vain for something
to say. But Gailliard either did not
observe his silence or found it natural.
"Come, it is time we were turning homeward,"
he cried. They turned their

<!-- page 154 -->

horses' heads. "A&iuml;e! a&iuml;e! the agony will
soon be over. For I make no doubt she
will bestow her hand on Delaup."</p>

<p>"What!" cried the vicomte sharply.
"Monsieur Delaup," he added composedly,
"is doubtless a good parti for
Mademoiselle de la Roche. He is rich,
handsome, and well placed. I scarce know
the gentleman myself. He seems to have
some grudge against me."</p>

<p>Gailliard laughed. "Reason enough,
my dear Henri. Diane, always Diane!
He chanced to hear you, the very first day
of your arrival in New Orleans, inquiring
the way to the Ch&acirc;teau de la Roche.
That you did not go there at all, that
your casual inquiry had naught to do with
Mademoiselle de la Roche, that you are
in fact the foe of the beautiful Diane,
has not altered the result; the fuse was
lighted by that accidental spark; I told
him so at the time."</p>

<p>"And the Little Chevalier?" The

<!-- page 155 -->

words escaped de Valdeterre's lips before
he knew it. He crimsoned painfully.</p>

<p>"The Little Chevalier!" echoed Gailliard
gayly; he glanced around with pretended
anxiety. "Oh! we are at a safe
distance from the Palace! Let us pray
that the winds of heaven carry not the
forbidden name to his excellency's ears!
Well, what of the Little Chevalier, vicomte?"</p>

<p>"Why does he not return? How long
does he mean to leave his sister to manage
the affairs of la Roche?"</p>

<p>Gailliard looked keenly at the agitated
speaker; his own manner suddenly lost
its careless gayety. "The Little Chevalier,"
he said gravely, "stays away
with the full consent of Mademoiselle
de la Roche. And, if you knew the
beautiful Diane as well as I do, faith,
you would understand that she is quite
capable of managing the affairs of her
house."</p>

<!-- page 156 -->

<p>De Valdeterre bowed, understanding
that the subject was definitely closed.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>He gave his horse into the hands of
an orderly at the government stables, and
bidding Gailliard good-by, he sauntered
out a side street toward the rear of the
town. For once Diane de la Roche was
absent from his thoughts; he had laid
the ghost, according to rule, by speaking
to it; his talk with Gailliard, though
actually telling him nothing he had not
already heard, had relaxed the tension
of his overstrained nerves; he felt an
unwonted lightness of heart; his mind,
free for the moment, took in with keen
interest, and as if he saw them for the first
time, the physical features of Bienville's
little city by the Mech&eacute;ch&eacute;be. The islets
of Blond de la Tour, nearly all palisaded
with rough-hewn cypress stakes driven
into the ground, were also moated, so to
speak, like the Ch&acirc;teau de la Roche, with

<!-- page 157 -->

open ditches. The squares near the river,
and toward the Church St. Louis, the core
of the town, were well built up with cottages
and two-storied houses, half brick,
half cypress, with sunny open galleries
and tiled roofs. In some of the streets
forest trees were still standing; the
advancing spring had clothed these and
the vines and shrubs which overtopped
the palisades in tender green. Through
more than one open gateway the passerby
caught glimpses of symmetrical rows
of blossoming waxberry trees, or of
wild cherries, snow white with bloom.
Few people were abroad, though as he
walked on he could hear the hum of
life busy behind closed gates. An occasional
heavy vehicle lumbered along, or
a dragoon, with clatter of harness, rode
by.</p>

<p>He reached the rampart and turned
southward on his way to a long low building
between St. Louis and Toulouse

<!-- page 158 -->

streets,&mdash;the Charity Hospital,&mdash;where
a man he had known in Paris, a broken-down
adventurer, lay sick of a fever.</p>

<p>As he approached the tall, whitewashed,
wooden gate, a horse attached to a stake
near by, frightened by the shouts of
some boys at play in the shadow of the
stockaded rampart, reared violently, broke
his fastenings, and dashed snorting down
the street.</p>

<p>De Valdeterre, horror-stricken, noted
a child, an infant not more than a year
old, sitting unconscious and smiling in
the dust directly in the path of the
plunging animal. He sprang forward on
a run, but before he had made half a dozen
steps a woman in the garb of a nun
darted into view. She looked curiously
tall in her flowing garments as she leaped
upward and caught at the flying bridle.
De la Valdeterre, pounding along, cried
aloud, his heart chilled with terror. He
never could quite make out how it happened;

<!-- page 159 -->

the Sister, with a single movement
it seemed to him, had turned the
frantic horse aside and dragged the child
from under his hoofs.</p>

<p>The horse, freed from her grasp, thundered
on, swerving but a fraction as he
passed de Valdeterre, who slackened his
pace.</p>

<p>By the time he came up several women
had swarmed to the spot, he knew not
from where. One of them wept aloud
and wrung her hands, while the child's
rescuer berated her in round terms, in a
rich sonorous voice, for allowing her baby
to run such risks.</p>

<p>"It is such careless mothers as thou,
Margot Gros," she said, "whom the good
God ought to punish by taking their
children away from them. If it happen
again that child of thine, or thine, or
thine," she whipped fiercely around upon
the other women, "be allowed to wander
unhanded in the street, by the Holy Virgin,

<!-- page 160 -->

I will put my own hand upon it, and
thou shalt never see it again!"</p>

<p>The women broke into eager protestations;
the infant's mother still wept
and wrung her hands. The nun, whose
veil drooped over her face and shoulders,
ceased to speak, and sat down suddenly
in the dust, coddling the sobbing baby in
her arms and crooning to it. De Valdeterre,
pausing beside her, saw that her
hands trembled, and that her head drooped
and her slender body swayed to and fro,
as if she were about to faint.</p>

<p>"Permit me, ma s&oelig;ur," he said with
great gentleness, stooping to take the
child from her, perceiving that the
mother was too unstrung or too awed
to do so.</p>

<p>The nun lifted her head; the long veil
fell aside, revealing to his astonished
gaze the face of Diane de la Roche.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 161 -->

<div class="center" id="ch12">

<p>XII</p>

<p class="small">FLEUR-DE-LIS</p>

</div>

<p>THE simple words uttered by de
Valdeterre, or the sight of his
downward-bent face, acted like
a galvanic shock on Diane de la Roche.
She sprang to her feet, clasping the wailing
baby to her breast; and for a moment
the foes stood facing each other as they
had done once before, in the curtained
recess of the palace at the F&ecirc;te des Rois.
But this time neither spoke; the man
fell back a step or two, baring his head
before the well-remembered upfling of
the girl's, under her flowing veil. She
turned to lay the child in the mother's
arms. "You will do well to heed what I
have said, Margot Gros, and you others,
also," she said deliberately, with an admonitory

<!-- page 162 -->

gesture which included each
of her listeners, "or I warn you that
P&egrave;re Lebesque shall put the whole of
you under the Church's ban."</p>

<p>An involuntary outcry broke from the
women, who pressed nearer to each other,
huddling the little ones at their knees
into the folds of their petticoats. Diane
followed her terrible threat with a smile
of such infinite sweetness that even her
enemy felt it like a benediction; then,
still utterly ignoring his presence, she
beckoned to a negress near by, who carried
a basket on her arm, and accompanied
by this attendant, she passed rapidly
down the street.</p>

<p>The women watched her in breathless
silence until she turned a distant corner;
then they burst into an uproar of ejaculation.</p>

<p>"A&iuml;e! A&iuml;e! But Mam'selle Diane hath
a hard tongue!"</p>

<p>"Nay, gossip, but a soft heart!"</p>

<!-- page 163 -->

<p>"I know, yes. Oh, but an angel! that
jumps at the eyes!"</p>

<p>"P&egrave;re Lebesque, who sees already the
least slant in the eye! Mon Dieu! Mon
Dieu!"</p>

<p>"She scolds roundly, Mam'selle Diane!
Like the Great Chevalier, her father!"</p>

<p>"True, and she hath gold in her throat,
like the Great Chevalier, her father!"</p>

<p>"Poor Margot! But she scourged thee
like a dog!"</p>

<p>"Hold your tongues, wooden heads!
Mam'selle Diane did right to scourge
me!" cried Margot Gros with spirit.
"But for her, as you saw with your own
eyes, you miserable imbeciles of mothers,
my little Pierre&mdash;Oh, where wouldst
thou be at this moment, my treasure!"
She sobbed, kissing the top of the baby's
head.</p>

<p>"True, yes, as the words of the Holy
Father himself!" chorused the others;
and then fell suddenly silent as de Valdeterre,

<!-- page 164 -->

whose presence they had forgotten,
stepped forward.</p>

<p>"The pious nun yonder"&mdash;he began,
nodding in the direction taken by Diane.</p>

<p>"Oh, your excellency," interrupted
one of the younger women, dropping a
profound curtsy before the handsome
stranger, "Mam'selle Diane is not a nun,
if it please you."</p>

<p>De Valdeterre's interested "Ah?" set
loose once more a babel of tongues.</p>

<p>"Nay, but let me speak," insisted
Margot Gros, out of the midst of it,
"seeing that it was my Pierre that m'sieu
was also trying to save."</p>

<p>"True, I saw him running, me! Mon
Dieu, but how m'sieu ran!"</p>

<p>"Exactly under the belly of the terrible
beast."</p>

<p>"A&iuml;e! but it makes the heart bleed to
think of it!"</p>

<p>"The demoiselle, m'sieu," persisted
Margot Gros,&mdash;"may all the saints bless

<!-- page 165 -->

her!&mdash;is not a nun. She is a great lady,
m'sieu, a demoiselle who could set her
little foot if she liked on the neck of the
great marquis himself; nay, even on the
neck of the king, long live his majesty!
Her name, may it please m'sieu, is Mam'selle
Diane de la Roche; her father was
the Great Chevalier; and my own father,
Jean Pellier, fought under him in the
wars, and hath at this very moment a
pension from Mam'selle Diane."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Diane de la Roche."
The vicomte repeated the name very
slowly, as if to fix it upon his memory.
"But the nun's robe&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Oh, ay. No wonder m'sieu is puzzled.
Mam'selle Diane hath permission
from the M&egrave;re Sup&eacute;rieure to wear that
robe when she goes forth to the Hospital
yonder to carry conserves and wine and
fruit to the sick; and to minister to the
women and children there."</p>

<p>De Valdeterre had slipped a shining

<!-- page 166 -->

louis d'or in the palm of the little Pierre;
he closed the fat fingers over it. "You
will do well," he remarked with sudden
sternness, moving back and inclining his
head in a courtly bow to the group, "you
will do well to heed the admonition of
Mademoiselle Diane de la Roche, all of
you. There is P&egrave;re Lebesque; there is,
besides, the&mdash;guardhouse."</p>

<p>He strolled away, leaving abashed consternation
behind him.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>A week later de Valdeterre rode forth
from the city again; on this occasion one
of a glittering cavalcade of ladies and
gentlemen on horseback and in carriages;
the company, in fact, embraced almost
the entire court of the great marquis and
his lady, the marquise. The latter sat
in the state-coach, drawn by its four
white horses, with outriders in livery
alongside; having at her side Madame
d'Hauterive. The governor, with most of

<!-- page 167 -->

the younger men and women, was on
horseback.</p>

<p>The gay cort&egrave;ge, prepared for one of
those out-of-door f&ecirc;tes in which the
Marquis de Vaudreuil delighted, passed
from the Place d'Armes, where they had
assembled, between rows of the admiring
bourgeoisie which lined the streets, toward
the ramparts in the rear of the
town. An escort of dragoons preceded
the columns; Porte St. Jean, the gate in
the stockade, was thrown open, the drawbridge
over the outer moat was lowered
with a flourish, and the long array swept
out. The Bayou Road wound lakeward
between wide expanses of <i>cypri&egrave;re</i>. Just
without the stockade, skirting the road,
were a few country houses, standing on
ground that had been raised and drained;
these were inclosed, like the squares of
the city, with palisades; one&mdash;green
foliage overtopping its more pretentious
wall&mdash;with red-roofed mansion embowered

<!-- page 168 -->

in oaks and magnolias showing in
the distance&mdash;was the demesne de la
Roche which de Valdeterre now saw for
the first time since the day of his encounter
with the Little Chevalier. The
sight of it aroused a fierce longing for
the moment when he might once again
face&mdash;<i>&agrave; l'outrance!</i>&mdash;the impertinent
boy with a man's wrist of steel.</p>

<p>He made an effort to bring his attention
back to what the governor was saying;
they were riding abreast and somewhat
in advance of the others.</p>

<p>"My dear Henri, I am sure of it! De
la Rouvilli&egrave;re would undermine me if he
could&mdash;that goes without saying. The
commissary intendant of this Province,
be he Lenormant, de la Rouvilli&egrave;re, or
another, is the traditional enemy of the
governor, whomsoever the governor may
chance to be. Every ship which leaves
this port carries, I know, a packet of
charges and complaints against me from

<!-- page 169 -->

Michel de la Rouvilli&egrave;re. The commissary
intendant has even dared to insinuate
to his too-ready listeners that the
Marquise de Vaudreuil sells drugs and
medicines to the colonists! By Heaven,
as soon as I may, without implicating
those at Versailles who have betrayed
him, I will force the intendant at the
point of the sword to eat his own
words!"</p>

<p>"But as to the letters?" suggested
the vicomte.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know what you would say,
Henri. De la Rouvilli&egrave;re, treacherous as
he is, would not stoop to the baseness of
opening or reading private letters. There
is nevertheless some one who has access
to my papers; who reads my letters and
dispatches and reports their contents to
Paris, or sets them in the air here. It
must be some underling, a lackey perhaps
in the pay&mdash; My God, I know not
of whom!"</p>

<!-- page 170 -->

<p>De Valdeterre's mind gave a swift
backward leap&mdash;the man in his shirt
sleeves, sitting beside a table strewn with
papers, his large face lighted by a malicious
smile, the tea-pot hissing over its
lamp at his elbow!</p>

<p>He looked over his shoulder at Diane
de la Roche, riding with Delaup at her
bridle-rein. The report of her approaching
marriage must be true! She was
pointing with her whip to that corner of
the ch&acirc;teau park where the plaisance
lay concealed behind the protecting palisade.
Her light laugh floated to his ears:
he thought of the Huntress on her pedestal
yonder, of the sundial in its grassy
pasture, of the mirror-like pool in its ring
of emerald; he pictured Diane sitting
with her betrothed in the shadow of her
marble namesake, or bending with him
over dial or fountain.&mdash;No, the spy
could not be Delaup; Diane, or the man
whom Diane might choose for a mate,

<!-- page 171 -->

would, if an enemy, be at least an open
enemy!</p>

<p>"Halt, ladies and gentlemen!" The
governor's voice had recovered its wonted
tone of gayety. "We are arrived at our
castle in the greenwood!"</p>

<p>As they advanced along the Bayou
Road, there had appeared here and there
in the swamp, glimpses of open spaces
where the latanier grew in spreading
clusters, and where great live-oaks
stretched their limbs above a grassy
sward dotted with wild flowers. The cort&eacute;ge
had now turned aside, following a
less beaten track, and paused on the edge
of one of these islands, a wide, velvety
green reach in the neighborhood of the
spot where to-day stands the famous
shrine of St. Roch.</p>

<p>The ground rose to a slight ridge
crested with noble trees; then sloped
gently away on the farther side and
merged into a marshy coul&eacute;e, along whose

<!-- page 172 -->

outer edge ran a small sluggish stream,&mdash;one
of the many little tributaries of the
Bayou St. Jean.</p>

<p>A cry of wonder and delight broke
from the lips of the junketers. The coul&eacute;e
and the low banks of the bayou were
a blaze of color under the sunny April
sky; fleurs-de-lis of every imaginable
hue&mdash;dark and pale blue, rose, yellow,
brown, dusted with gold, crimson, white,
violet&mdash;filled all the open, rippling like
a variegated sea to the green foot of the
ridge.</p>

<p>But a brief moment for a contemplation
of this picture was allowed by the
bustling master of ceremonies; cavaliers
and demoiselles alighted, carriages were
emptied of their occupants, and horses
led away by waiting grooms; rugs were
laid under the trees, the Court was seated
in a semicircle about the Marquis and
Madame de Vaudreuil. At a signal from
the former the prearranged pastimes

<!-- page 173 -->

began, with a padegaud-shooting, by a
dozen or more Colapissa Indians, a tribe
from the beginning friendly to the colonists.</p>

<p>The sport of the "padegaud," similar
to the popinjay-shooting in vogue at the
same date in England and Scotland, consisted
in shooting for a prize with bow
and arrow, or firearm, at a wooden bird
bedecked with feathers and ribbons, the
performance ending with a series of leaps
and contortions around the target, accompanied
by the throwing of hatchets, and
with deafening yells, imitative of the
tribal war-dance.</p>

<p>At the close of the present contest,
which was not sufficiently novel to provoke
more than a languid interest among
the spectators, the trophy was awarded
the victor, a filet of tafia heated the
throats of the defeated marksmen, and
the Colapissas departed, leaving the riddled
padegaud behind them.</p>

<!-- page 174 -->

<p>It was Gailliard who suggested a padegaud
tourney among the young men.
The proposition was hailed with noisy
enthusiasm; the forlorn-looking bird was
set in place, and one after another of the
gallants of the Little Versailles stepped
forth to make trial of his skill&mdash;with
varying success&mdash;under the eye of the
Grace and Beauty of the Province, declared
the governor with a courtly bow
which included all the women present.</p>

<p>When the turn of the Vicomte de
Valdeterre came, there was a hush of expectation,
for the handsome Parisian had
on more than one occasion justified his
title to first place among the sportsmen
of the court. His hand was steady as he
lifted the pistol, his eye unclouded as he
took aim, his heart-beat absolutely normal
as he fired. But as if magnetized by
a pair of mocking blue eyes in the shining
circle about Madame de Vaudreuil,
his weapon swerved imperceptibly, his

<!-- page 175 -->

bullet went ever so little aside of the
beaded eye of the padegaud.</p>

<p>Delaup, who came next, planted his
bullet full in the centre of the mark,
splintering the head. A murmur of applause
greeted him as he turned&mdash;a
subdued murmur, for Monsieur Delaup,
in spite of his position, was not
a favorite. Above it, the voice of Mademoiselle
de la Roche rang out clear and
incisive:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bravo, Monsieur Delaup! Bravo and
thanks! Louisiana against France! New
Orleans against Paris! Victory!"</p>

<p>She had leaped to her feet, her perfect
figure in its close-fitting habit of dark
green was outlined against the gray trunk
of the ancient oak, her eyes sparkled, her
cheeks were flushed. A frantic clapping
of hands, provoked less by her words
than by her beauty, echoed through the
wood. Delaup, stepping to her side, raised
her hand to his lips, and bowed his

<!-- page 176 -->

thanks for her, like one who has the right
to do so.</p>

<p>"Treason, mademoiselle, treason!" cried
the marquis; "we shall have you shut up
in the Fort St. Charles!"</p>

<p>"Or the Bastille," amended d'Hauterive
gayly.</p>

<p>"Oh! let it be the Bastille, your excellency,"
retorted Diane with a steady
look at De Valdeterre. "And the sooner
monsieur reports my treason to his majesty,
the better."</p>

<p>"For shame, Diane!" said Madame de
Vaudreuil sternly.</p>

<p>"Your excellency," said the vicomte
coolly, addressing the governor, "beauty
can utter no treason. Besides, madame,"
he turned to the marquise, "France, on
occasion, knows how to be deaf; Paris,
when to be dumb."</p>

<p>A renewed clapping of hands greeted
this speech, which was uttered with a
smile. The governor, as if to prevent further

<!-- page 177 -->

exchange of hostilities, called hastily
for the next number on the programme;
and amid the bustle which succeeded, de
Valdeterre moved quietly away through
the trees. He descended the slope and
stood gazing with unseeing eyes over the
field of lilies, endeavoring vainly to calm
his anger. He would have liked to slay the
beautiful Huntress where she stood!</p>

<p>"Bah!" He threw out his hands as if
dismissing the subject at once and forever.
He stooped and plucked the lily
which blossomed at his feet. "Blue as
the eyes of Alys d'Hauterive," he murmured,
looking into its heart, well knowing
that the eyes of Alys d'Hauterive
were not blue, but black as the berry of
the wild bamboo-vine.</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Valdeterre." The low
voice at his ear was unknown to him,
and yet strangely familiar; he turned
quickly. Diane de la Roche stood beside
him: her bared head was bent a little

<!-- page 178 -->

forward, her bright hair falling over her
face; her blue eyes sought his frankly.
"Monsieur de Valdeterre." She paused a
second and continued: "If your father
died by the hand of mine, my father died
because of yours, in exile and far from
the land he loved. You, who have the
favor of king and court; you, who are a
man and free, and may do what you will,
and go where it pleases you, why do you
stoop to hate me, who am but a woman?
I, at least, have never harmed you."</p>

<p>The lily dropped from de Valdeterre's
nerveless hand. The attack was so unexpected;
the appeal was in such contrast
to Diane's former disdainful manner,
her plaintive tone so gave the lie to
her brutal words flung at him a bare half
hour earlier,&mdash;that he remained absolutely
incapable of speech.</p>

<p>Diane glanced over her shoulder; following
her eyes, he saw that Delaup had
detached himself from the group under

<!-- page 179 -->

the trees and was coming rapidly toward
them. "Why do you hate me, Monsieur
de Valdeterre?" she persisted.</p>

<p>But Delaup had reached her side,
breathless. "Mademoiselle," he said,
"Madame de Vaudreuil has sent me to
fetch you to her. Pardon, Monsieur le
Vicomte." And with a low bow to de
Valdeterre, the secretary held out his
hand to Diane, who, as on a former
occasion, laid the tips of her fingers on
his sleeve, and with a haughty movement
of her head turned away.</p>

<p>At the same moment a tumult arose
in the very centre of the f&ecirc;te. There was
a sharp outcry, a scurrying to and fro,
a rapid mounting of horses, a jingle of
stirrup and spur.</p>

<p>De Valdeterre sprang up the slope and
ran to the spot where his horse was fastened.
"What is it?" he demanded of
Gailliard, who was adjusting his saddle-girth.</p>

<!-- page 180 -->

<p>"A runner from above Ste. Genevieve
Plantation,"&mdash;they swung themselves simultaneously
into their saddles,&mdash;"with
news of another Indian massacre."</p>

<p>They galloped after the governor, already
flying along the Bayou Road toward
Porte St. Jean, leaving the frightened
women to follow with the lackeys and
the unopened hampers.</p>

<p class="small">THE UNDER-SECRETARY</p>

</div>

<p>THE Place d'Armes, when the governor,
throwing himself from
his foam-covered horse, entered
its upper gate, presented a scene of picturesque
animation. The four gates stood
open according to custom; a motley crowd
surged in and out of these, pressing to
one or another of the several centres of
interest in the dusty trampled square.
One focus was a booth just outside the
Ste. Anne gate, where <i>estomae mulatre</i>
(gingerbread) and tafia, a sort of rum,
were for sale; here half-breed Indians,
free blacks, Canadian boatmen, and <i>Kaintuck</i>
traders mingled freely together,
swearing, singing, and quarreling over
their liquor. Over against the Church St.

<!-- page 182 -->

Louis, a man in the sober garb of a merchant,
just arrived from France in the
Dromedaire, now swinging to her moorings
on the levee, was haranguing a group
of workmen concerning certain new doctrines
creeping into men's heads in France.
But the principal point of excitement, and
that toward which the governor and his
suite made their way, was near the river,
or levee gate. A company of soldiers
from the barracks formed there a compact
outer barrier, within which stood
several of the king's officers, and two or
three members of the Superior Council,&mdash;Fleurian,
the attorney-general, Belleisle,
military commandant, and Allard, lieutenant
du roi. In the midst of them, in
an attitude of sullen dignity, was the
runner&mdash;an Indian lad about nineteen
years old, a brave of the Chickasaw nation.
He stood a little apart from the officers,
a striking figure in his deerskin leggings
and tunic; his red blanket drawn over

<!-- page 183 -->

one shoulder exposed his bare breast,
tattooed with the totem of his tribe. His
scalp-lock was adorned with a couple of
tall eagles' feathers; his belt was edged
with a heavy fringe of beads. His hands
and his belt were empty, but a rifle and
a knife with acacia wood handle lay on
the ground at his feet.</p>

<p>He lifted sombre eyes to the governor
as the latter paused in front of him.</p>

<p>"The rogue refuses to talk, your excellency,"
said Major Belleisle in an irritated
tone. "He unburdened himself of
a few words when he first came, but his
mouth this half hour hath been as close
as an oyster. Faith, if I had my way, I
would set him to the stake and scorch
him until"&mdash;</p>

<p>The governor lifted an arresting hand.</p>

<p>"No wonder the dog is dumb," ventured
Fleurian in his ear. "He hath
been jostled as rudely as if he came at
the head of a band of painted warriors,

<!-- page 184 -->

instead of alone, and as a messenger of
warning and distress."</p>

<p>De Vaudreuil beckoned the lad nearer;
the tall figure remained motionless and
rigid, the eyes fixed on space; the sensitive
nostrils, widening and quivering,
alone showed signs of life.</p>

<p>But the set features suddenly relaxed;
the right hand was extended; a slow
smile parted the thin lips, and a musical
murmur burst from them.</p>

<p>The ungainly form of Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute; had
pushed its way through the circle. The
dancing master strode up to the runner
and paused; he exchanged, in a tongue
unintelligible to the hearers, a few words
with the Indian, who took his hand and
stroked it caressingly.</p>

<p>"It is the young chief, Chivonah, the
adopted son of Cheville Rouge," B&eacute;b&eacute;
explained to the governor. "He brings
a message to the Great White Chief. It
is for the ears of the White Chief and

<!-- page 185 -->

not for these dogs of soldiers&mdash;The
words, may it please your excellency, are
not mine, but Chivonah's," B&eacute;b&eacute; hastened
to add, as an angry growl ran around the
group.</p>

<p>The marquis smiled behind his hand.
"Say to my red brother that it is well,"
he returned. "Let him follow us to the
Government House; and you, Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;,
will you, since you know the lad"&mdash;</p>

<p>"He is the son of La Temp&ecirc;te," B&eacute;b&eacute;
interjected gravely.</p>

<p>"Ah!" The governor looked with
lively curiosity at the runner, who, hearing
the name of his famous mother, drew
himself up proudly.</p>

<p>"And of the Chevalier de la Ro"&mdash;</p>

<p>The governor stopped the speaker with a
warning glance, and proceeded,&mdash;"Since
you are acquainted with the young chief,
and with the tongue of the Chickasaws"&mdash;</p>

<p>"From long service in his majesty's

<!-- page 186 -->

Indian wars, your excellency,"
interjected B&eacute;b&eacute; again.</p>

<p>&mdash;"You will therefore accompany us
and act as interpreter."</p>

<p>Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute; removed his ribboned chapeau
and made a sweeping reverence;
then touching Chivonah on the shoulder,
he bade him follow the Great White
Father to the Council Lodge.</p>

<p>The news brought by Chivonah was
indeed grave. The Chickasaw Indians,
who since the day Bienville first set foot
on the soil of southern New France had
been the implacable foes of the French,
continued, though reduced to a remnant
of their former greatness, to harass the
settlers in the interior. Latterly they
had received into their band the scattered
warriors of the once powerful
and always bloodthirsty and treacherous
Natchez nation, which some years before
had suffered defeat and dismemberment
at the hands of the French. Thus mutually

<!-- page 187 -->

strengthened, the murderous allies
swept out from their fortified villages,
and swooped down upon the defenseless
planters, or attacked the feeble garrisons
of the little forts scattered up and down
the river. La Temp&ecirc;te, the great medicine
woman of the Chickasaws, regarded
with almost superstitious reverence by
her people, had more than once before
now, for the love it was said that she
bore the Chevalier de la Roche, sent a
timely warning to the whites.</p>

<p>Chivonah, producing from his belt his
mother's well-known token,&mdash;warrant of
his own good faith,&mdash;told the story of
the massacre of habitans in a settlement
some twenty miles above the ruins
of Fort Rosalie on the Mississippi, and of
a projected descent by a chosen band of
warriors upon the plantations below. This
mission was fraught with great danger
both to himself and to La Temp&ecirc;te. The
latter, remaining during her son's absence

<!-- page 188 -->

in the camp of the allied Chickasaws
and Natchez, assured the white chief, by
the mouth of Chivonah, that the young
warrior on his return would assume the
war paint and fight with his own tribe.</p>

<p>"A strange people," mused the governor,
looking absently at the lad, when
the interpreter had ended the interview
with this statement. "It might be safer,"
he added abruptly, "to hold the redskin
a prisoner. There may be treachery"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your excellency," the Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;
broke in proudly, "there is treachery
neither in the blood of La Temp&ecirc;te, nor
in that of La Roche."</p>

<p>"True, B&eacute;b&eacute;; we have in times past
tested both. See to his safety, Belleisle;"
he turned to the commandant; "and let
him carry our thanks to La Temp&ecirc;te.
Let him say to her that the French, whose
numbers are as the leaves of the forest,
will know how, when the moment arrives,
to meet the Natchez and the Chickasaws&mdash;and

<!-- page 189 -->

that one of our young braves was
born to put a bullet in the heart of
Chivonah."</p>

<p>The dancing master repeated this
speech, word for word, to the Indian, whose
eyes lighted ferociously. He laid a finger
on the totem which decorated his breast
and said in hesitating but intelligible
French, "Chivonah proud! Chivonah
strong! Chivonah proud with blood from
great red mother! Chivonah strong with
blood from great white father! Bullet no
kill Chivonah!"</p>

<p>De Valdeterre remained, an interested
spectator of this novel scene, until the
young chief had stalked away with Belleisle,
seeming to dominate his escort, toward
the Porte St. Louis, whence he would
glide into the fastness of the <i>cypri&egrave;re</i> and
disappear; then he hurried out. The entire
population of the town by this time
had swarmed to the square; at the barracks
preparations were under way for

<!-- page 190 -->

the sending out of several hundred regulars,
including a contingent of Colapissa
Indians; on the levee provisions and ammunition
were being hastily stored on
board the boats which were to follow, by
way of the river, the landward expedition;
in a building in St. Peter Street,
facing the square, registers had been
opened, and the Company of Bachelors&mdash;a
company organized under the direction
of Bienville in 1735, composed
of unmarried men&mdash;was reorganizing.
Nearly all the cadets of good families
about the town had already enrolled
themselves; Gailliard and D'Hauterive
had just signed as de Valdeterre entered,
coming up from a hasty survey of the
fleet. He placed his name beneath theirs,
and a little later found himself by appointment
of the Council captain of the
company, de Contre C&oelig;ur being first lieutenant.
The afternoon had drawn on; he
repaired with other officers to the Government

<!-- page 191 -->

House, and there passed a busy
evening examining maps, receiving instructions,
and gaining such information
as could be extracted from reports of
former and similar expeditions. The governor
remained in his private office planning
and advising with Belleisle and other
senior officers in command; the under-secretary,
Delaup, unable to volunteer because
of his official position, about nine
o'clock pleaded a sudden indisposition
and withdrew.</p>

<p>Toward midnight Gailliard and de
Valdeterre proceeded to <i>Le Veau qui
T&ecirc;te</i>, with the intention of supping together.
As they set foot on the banquette
in front of the caf&eacute;, Gailliard held back,
peering up the dark street.</p>

<p>"What is it, des Marets?" demanded
his companion a trifle impatiently.</p>

<p>"Nothing. I thought I had caught a
glimpse of Delaup. But I was mistaken."</p>

<p>De Valdeterre stepped back in time to

<!-- page 192 -->

see a shadow disappear into the unlighted
alley. He stood a moment irresolute; and
when they had ascended to the small
room reserved for Monsieur Raguet's
most favored clients, he communicated,
with sudden determination to the engineer,
certain suspicions which had for
some weeks been gathering in his mind.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" burst out Gailliard,
throwing up both hands in amazed repudiation.</p>

<p>"Impossible. Yes, you are right; and
I dare swear I am a suspicious villain.
But&mdash;the Dromedaire has just come in
and&mdash;come, let us not think of it further!"</p>

<p>"Nay, Henri; we must at least set
doubt at rest. It would be cruelly unjust
to Delaup to drop the matter now."</p>

<p>They crossed the court and mounted
the stair to the vicomte's rooms. Chapron
was carousing genteelly in the public
room with other body-servants; but a

<!-- page 193 -->

light burned on the table; pipes, tobacco,
and cards were laid out, and a decanter
with glasses placed on a tray at hand,
showing the old man's care of his young
master.</p>

<p>The two men seated themselves and
waited in profound silence, though the
sound of their voices could not have
drifted through the closed and curtained
door. At the end of a half hour de Valdeterre
arose. "I am heartily ashamed of
my doubts, Gailliard. But as you say&mdash;Come
along, man, for God's sake, and let
us get it over!"</p>

<p>He passed softly out and along the
passageway, followed closely by Gailliard.
Opening the door of the cabinet, they
slipped stealthily in, guided by the broad
line of light which again lay on the dark
curtain opposite. De Valdeterre, with a
hand which shook a little, drew the porti&egrave;re
aside. Gailliard, peering over his
friend's shoulder, saw through the crack&mdash;Delaup.

<!-- page 194 -->

He was in the act of holding
a dispatch&mdash;with the government seal
upon it&mdash;over the steaming spout of the
vessel beneath which burned the blue
flame of an alcohol lamp. A confusion
of papers&mdash;letters, folded documents
with staring seals, memoranda, three-cornered
slips having the appearance of
billets-doux&mdash;a collection larger even
than that seen by de Valdeterre on a former
occasion&mdash;strewed the table. The
light of the candle, full upon the secretary's
face, showed an eager gleam in his
small eyes. "Aha, Monsieur le Marquis,"
he said aloud with exultation.</p>

<p>" 'Tis his habit to be ever talking to
himself, the fool," whispered Gailliard
excitedly. "Wait a bit!"</p>

<p>"And you, my fine Vicomte Henri
Louis de Valdeterre"&mdash;</p>

<p>"At your service. Monsieur Philippe
Delaup," said de Valdeterre politely,
wrenching back the rusty bolt and throwing

<!-- page 195 -->

open the door. Gailliard, with a grin
on his face, stepped into the room behind
the vicomte.</p>

<p>Delaup remained for one second transfixed
with surprise; the paper in his hand
fluttered to the floor. Then straightening
himself with an assumption of dignity,
he demanded sternly, "By what right,
messieurs, do you enter my room without
invitation in such rough fashion?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur Delaup," de Valdeterre
coolly returned, "will please remember
that he called me; or at least that he
took the liberty of using my name for
some purpose."</p>

<p>Delaup had recovered himself. "If
you do not leave this room at once," he
declared insolently, "I will facilitate your
departure."</p>

<p>As he spoke he picked up a pistol which
served as a weight to a pile of letters,
and leveled it with a finger on the trigger
at his unwelcome visitors. But Gailliard

<!-- page 196 -->

was too quick for him; he leaped forward
and caught in a grasp whose
strength was proverbial in the country
the hand that held the pistol. "Not so
fast, monsieur," he said gayly. "Now, de
Valdeterre!"</p>

<p>De Valdeterre looked down at the mass
of papers. "To the Marquis de Vaudreuil,"
"To His Excellency the Governor
of Louisiana," "To the Marquis de
Vaudreuil," "To Madame de Vaudreuil,"
"To the Chevalier de Contre C&oelig;ur," "To
Madame de Coulanges." He pushed dispatch
after dispatch aside as he read the
superscriptions letter after letter.</p>

<p>Delaup became livid; he bit his lips
until the blood ran, writhing under Gailliard's
iron grasp. "How dare you&mdash;!"
he began.</p>

<p>"No heroics, if you please, monsieur,"
suggested Gailliard.</p>

<p>"The mystery is solved at last," said
de Valdeterre contemptuously, stepping

<!-- page 197 -->

back. "The governor hath been much
perplexed over the unaccountable escape
of late of state secrets. The unlocking
of the dispatch boxes hath been a pleasant
and doubtless a profitable amusement
for his excellency's under-secretary!
The theatre of the performance too hath
been well chosen,"&mdash;he glanced around
the shadowy room,&mdash;"but unfortunately
for the performer, dangerously near&mdash;others."</p>

<p>"Spy!" hissed Delaup.</p>

<p>"His excellency," continued de Valdeterre
imperturbably, "will profit by the
discontinuance of the play."</p>

<p>Delaup's nerve deserted him; his face
from livid became green, then purple.
"You will&mdash;you will inform his ex&mdash;?"
He gasped for breath.</p>

<p>"Neither Monsieur des Marets nor myself,"
said de Valdeterre haughtily, "desires
to play the r&ocirc;le of informer. You
will, under the direction of Monsieur des

<!-- page 198 -->

Marets and myself, gather up these
papers and dispatches&mdash;which I make
no doubt have just arrived by the Dromedaire;
those which you have opened, you
will reseal after the recipe you are in
the habit of using"&mdash;</p>

<p>Delaup winced.</p>

<p>"You will return letters and dispatches
to the box which I see lying on
the floor by your chair; you will close
the box with the false key in your possession"&mdash;Delaup
uttered an ejaculation
of rage&mdash;"and hand the key to
Monsieur des Marets; then you will
summon your confederate"&mdash;Delaup
started violently, and Gailliard turned
an inquiring eye on his friend;&mdash;"you
will by his hands return the box to the
secret bureau of the governor&mdash;nay,
protests are out of place! Your messenger,
whose courage may need strengthening,
will be accompanied to the Government
House by Monsieur des Marets, who

<!-- page 199 -->

afterward will proceed with him to the
river, and there under his eye drop the
false key into the waters of the Mississippi.
Monsieur, I have finished." He
inclined his head in ironical courtesy.</p>

<p>Delaup opened his lips to speak, but
closed them again, and proceeded sullenly
and methodically to follow the
orders of the vicomte, his two unbidden
guests looking on in silence. At length
he locked the dispatch box and handed
the key to Gailliard; then walking to an
outer door, attended politely by the engineer,
he opened it and whistled softly.
Almost immediately a man appeared, a
sleek, crafty-looking individual whom
Gailliard recognized as a sort of hanger-on
about the Government House. He gave
a quick, surprised look at his employer,
but instantly composed his face and received
the precise and apparently spontaneous
orders from Delaup in respectful
silence.</p>

<!-- page 200 -->

<p>"Come back, Gailliard, when you have
finished with him," said de Valdeterre as
the man and his armed jailer passed out.</p>

<p>"And now, Monsieur Delaup," he continued,
turning back into the room where
the under-secretary waited impotently
his further pleasure, "you will have the
goodness to seat yourself at yonder table&mdash;where
I perceive you have pen and
ink, as well as tools for prying into the
affairs of household and State&mdash;and
write your resignation"&mdash;</p>

<p>"A thousand curses on you! I will
not! D&mdash;&mdash; you, I will not!"</p>

<p>" 'Tis a small price to pay for immunity
from disgrace," observed de Valdeterre
quietly.</p>

<p>Delaup looked at him, hesitated, and
walked rapidly to the table. He seated
himself, and with a hand which seemed
to have recovered its steadiness, he wrote
the formal note of resignation demanded.</p>

<p>"Very well," said his companion, glancing

<!-- page 201 -->

over the written page handed him
and returning it. "You will fold, seal, and
address this document, and see that it is
placed in the hands of the governor before
ten of the clock to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"I had supposed that the Vicomte de
Valdeterre, having secured it, would have
handed the resignation to the Marquis
de Vaudreuil, his kinsman, himself,"
sneered Delaup, heating the sealing-wax
over the candle. "Is it possible that
monsieur can so far trust the late under-secretary?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Valdeterre trusts to the
late under-secretary's fear of public exposure,"
returned the vicomte; "and in
this trust he has the honor to bid Monsieur
Delaup good-night."</p>

<p>He quitted the room by way of the
cabinet, closing and bolting the communicating
door behind him.</p>

<p>Delaup waited until the faintly heard
echoes of retreating footsteps had died

<!-- page 202 -->

into silence; then he drew some papers
from within his inner vest, and waved
them above his head, a crafty smile
spread over his broad face.</p>

<p>"Very well, indeed, Monsieur Henri
Louis Nadan, Vicomte de Valdeterre," he
muttered. "But you may yet have to
reckon with the&mdash;late&mdash;under-secretary."</p>

<p>XIV</p>

<p class="small">THE MINIATURE</p>

</div>

<p>"AN extraordinary thing has happened,"
said Gailliard the next
morning, as he entered the audience-chamber
and joined the group of
officers awaiting the governor's appearance,
"Delaup has handed in his resignation
as under-secretary to his excellency."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" cried de Coulanges.
"Certainly he had no intention as late as
yesterday afternoon of taking such a
step."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, it is true," said Belleisle;
"I have just been informed of it by
the marquis himself, who seems much
put about."</p>

<p>"Doubtless Monsieur Delaup intends
to march with the expedition," observed

<!-- page 204 -->

de Valdeterre with an appearance of interest.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," returned Belleisle,
"he remains to"&mdash;</p>

<p>"To marry la belle Diane," interrupted
another of the group, in a tone of conviction.</p>

<p>"When do we march?" demanded de
Valdeterre turning abruptly to Major
Belleisle, who had been placed in command
of the forces.</p>

<p>"Not later than the noon of to-morrow,"
returned that officer, hastening to
meet the governor, who entered at that
moment with several members of the
council. Delaup also came in with him.
He was talking in a low voice to the marquis:
a word or two which reached their
ears convinced Gailliard and de Valdeterre
that he was presenting plausible
reasons for his unexpected withdrawal
from the governor's service.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • •</p>

<!-- page 205 -->

<p>Toward mid-afternoon, the newly appointed
captain of the Company of Bachelors
returned to his apartment. He summoned
Chapron and informed the old
valet of his own forthcoming departure
on a campaign of uncertain duration.</p>

<p>"I leave you in charge of my affairs
during my absence," he concluded, "and
in case of my death"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Monsieur will pardon me if I interrupt,"
said Chapron. "It is not the place
of a domestic to interrupt, I know. But
it is useless for monsieur to proceed with
his instructions."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, rascal?" cried
his master, furious.</p>

<p>"It is quite useless for monsieur to
proceed with his instructions," protested
Chapron obstinately, "since wherever
monsieur goes, I go also."</p>

<p>"Blockhead!" cried de Valdeterre impatiently,
"you would but be in the way.
Besides, you are too old; you would"&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 206 -->

<p>"Pardon if I interrupt! But I promised
madame, the mother of monsieur,
that death alone should separate me from
her son. Where monsieur goes, I go."</p>

<p>"Chapron!" cried the young man, his
voice shaken with emotion, "thou art a
wooden head and an idiot; that jumps
at the eyes! But thou art a good soul.
Have thy way." He held out his hand,
which Chapron seized and pressed to his
withered cheek.</p>

<p>"I go to pack the portmanteau of monsieur,"
he said with a sudden return to
his ordinary respectful manner.</p>

<p>His master looked after him with an
affectionate smile as he passed out.</p>

<p>He set to work to sort over the letters
and papers in the accumulated mass in
his table drawers; but with a preoccupied
air. At length he pushed the pile
of stuff aside and leaned back in his
chair, admitting to himself frankly that
for twenty-four hours he had kept himself

<!-- page 207 -->

feverishly busy in the vain hope of
shutting Diane de la Roche out of his
thoughts.</p>

<p>"I love her," he admitted fiercely to
himself. "Why should I longer keep up
to my own heart the foolish pretense of
hating Diane de la Roche? I love her!
There is blood between us, and likely to
be more when that unreasonable boy
comes back&mdash;if he ever does. But I love
her. And&mdash;if she is wholly indifferent to
me, why should she have looked at me&mdash;as
she did look at me, out there by that
field of fleurs-de-lis? Oh, my father, if
you could have but foreseen!"</p>

<p>He folded his arms upon the table and
dropped his head upon them, shaken with
a tempest of conflicting emotions. Suddenly
he arose and took from a casket on
the mantel a case containing his father's
miniature; it was one which the elder
de Valdeterre had given his wife only
the day preceding the fatal duel. The

<!-- page 208 -->

son gazed long and fixedly at the fine
open face smiling out at him from within
the gold frame, as if asking the dead
father what he should do. He turned at
length with a sigh, intending to restore
the miniature to its receptacle; but as
he closed it the ivory, loosened from the
frame,&mdash;doubtless by the damp,&mdash;fell
into his open palm. He uttered a frightened
exclamation, followed by another
of curiosity, for fitted to the case underneath
where the portrait had been lay a
folded paper; he took it out and opened
the single thin, discolored sheet, which
he saw with a beating heart was covered
with writing.</p>

<p>It was a contract of marriage between
Henri Louis Nadan, son of Henri Nadan,
Vicomte de Valdeterre, and Marguerite
his wife, and Diane Barbe, daughter of
Valcour M&eacute;ry de la Roche, chevalier,
and Marie Barbe his wife. The contract
bore the date of January 4, 1734; and

<!-- page 209 -->

the signatures of the Vicomte de Valdeterre
and the Chevalier de la Roche,
with those of two witnesses, whose names
were dimly familiar to the reader. He
laid the yellowed sheet on the table and
seated himself in the chair he had just
vacated, for his knees trembled under
him. He leaned forward to read the paragraph
beneath the formally worded contract:&mdash;</p>

<br/>

<p>"If any difference should arise between
us, this shall in no particular affect
the fulfillment of the above contract between
the said Henri Louis and the said
Diane Barbe.</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Henri Nadan de Valdeterre,<br/>

Valcour M&eacute;ry de la Roche</span>."</p>

<br/>

<p>A contract of marriage between Henri
Louis Nadan de Valdeterre and Diane
Barbe de la Roche! Diane, then, at the
time of her betrothal to Henri Louis

<!-- page 210 -->

Nadan de Valdeterre would have been
about two years old, and the said Henri
Louis ten; and the said Henri&mdash;He
sprang to his feet in an access of delirious
joy; why, the said Henri was none
other than himself; and Diane, beautiful
Diane&mdash;oh, the thing was past all belief.
Yet, his mother's long-forgotten
words, meaningless to him at the time,
but wistful, sweet, tender, came back to
him: "It was ever the wish of your
father and Valcour"&mdash;</p>

<p>This, beyond a doubt, was the wish of
those two cruelly parted friends!</p>

<p>He folded and replaced the paper
under the miniature in its hiding-place,
fitted the miniature over it, and thrust
the case in his breast-pocket.</p>

<p>"Diane! my Diane!" The words
broke, exultant, from his lips. He seized
his hat and bounded down the stair like
a schoolboy.</p>

<p class="small">[<sup>1</sup>Mocking-bird (<i>oiseau moquer</i>).]</p>

<p>"JUST time for one word!" he murmured,
throwing himself upon his
horse. He rode at a gallop out to
the Port St. Jean. The soldiers saluted
as he passed the little pentagonal fort;
it seemed to him that there was something
pleasantly significant in their greeting:
it was in fact evoked partly by the
sight of the graceful and handsome figure
on the curveting steed, and partly by
the knowledge that here was the young
captain of the Company of Bachelors.</p>

<p>Leaving the Bayou Road on the left,
the rider turned into a rutty way overhung
by umbrageous oaks, which led in
the direction of the red-roofed house so

<!-- page 212 -->

keenly noted the day before. His eyes
sought, along the side-wall as he passed
it, the gate which once on a time he had
entered with Achille. He saw it, a green
patch in the distance. He smiled securely;
even the hot-headed Little Chevalier
would not insist on a duel <i>&aacute; l'outrance</i>
with his brother-in-law. All his own anger
and impatience had melted away; he
would have liked to take that red-headed
boy into his arms! Diane's brother!</p>

<p>He dismounted at the ponderous wooden
gate before the ch&acirc;teau, and tapped the
swinging bell with the hammer which
hung beside it. The gate was opened by
a negro, who took the visitor's horse and
ushered him in.</p>

<p>The hereditary enemy of the House of
la Roche passed up the wide, shelled walk&mdash;traversed
by him once before under a
January moon&mdash;which led to the house.
It was shaded by a double row of opoponax-trees,
whose tiny yellow puff-balls of

<!-- page 213 -->

blossoms loaded the air with a vanishing
perfume. The sweep of lawn to right and
left was dotted with clumps of bananas
with broad leaves rustling and swaying
in the breeze, and yuccas with tall spikes
of greenish-white, waxen, bell-like flowers.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the ch&acirc;teau, Achille,
the major-domo, greeted him. "Oui,
mich&eacute;, l' 'tite ma&icirc;tresse dans jardin. Mo
courri l'app&eacute;," he said eagerly, before
de Valdeterre had time to speak; he indicated
a small reception room on the
right of the hall and walked rapidly away.
But de Valdeterre, reckless of propriety,
followed upon his heels; he recognized,
as he passed it, the room where he had
lain listening to the dancing master's
discourse the night of the duel, and cursing
his own luck! The door was closed,
as was also the door directly opposite;
but through the latter came the sound of
voices, blended in song, and the ghost-like

<!-- page 214 -->

tinkle of a harpsichord. He knew
the voices; they were those of the Sieur
B&eacute;b&eacute; and the favorite of Louis the Magnificent:
thin and bodiless as dreams,
they united in a madrigal of youth and
love. He pictured to himself the ancient
dame whose youth seemed to him as remote
as that of the vanished gods, sitting
at the harpsichord, her Fontanges
headdress towering toward the ceiling,
and the fantastic figure of the ma&icirc;tre
de danse bending over her.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Oh, Love and Youth went forth together,<br/>

All in the gay and golden weather,"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>they sang, with many comical quips and
quirls and quavers. But the chance listener
stealing by had no mind to laugh.
"Oh, Youth and Love;" he repeated the
strain softly under his breath.</p>

<p>Achille, hastening out at a rear door,
had darted into a path that wound between
thyme-bordered beds in the potager;

<!-- page 215 -->

at an opening in the privet hedge,
arched over by a flowering jessamine, he
stopped. " 'Tite ma&icirc;tresse l&agrave;-bas, mich&eacute;,"
he said with a wave of the hand.</p>

<p>De Valdeterre thanked him with a
smile and the offer of a gold-piece, which
the negro rejected with dignity but without
offense.</p>

<p>The plaisance was wrapped in soft
shadow, for the sun had set; the warm
languid perfume of roses pervaded the
spot; the fountain lay dark and still
within its encircling ring of wide-leaved
caladiums. The white marble Diana
looked serenely down upon her white
namesake seated on a garden bench at
her feet. De Valdeterre's throat swelled
painfully as he came in sight of the graceful
figure as motionless&mdash;perhaps as
cold&mdash;as the one above it.</p>

<p>"Diane!" he breathed softly, standing
before her, "I have come to say but one
word, and to ask but one word in reply.

<!-- page 216 -->

I love you, Diane; I have loved you from
the first moment I saw you!"</p>

<p>She remained silent, though she lifted
to his her beautiful starry eyes.</p>

<p>"If you cannot love me in return," he
continued, steadying his voice, "at least
let there be peace between us."</p>

<p>"But," she murmured, and her tone
was so low that he had to bend forward
to hear her, "but I love you! I loved
you before"&mdash;she stopped, confused and
trembling; for he had seized her hands
and was pressing them passionately to
his breast.</p>

<p>The interview was short; too short
for explanation, or review of the past;
or even for him to show to her the betrothal
contract signed by Valcour de la
Roche and Henri de Valdeterre; long
enough only for a mutual pledge and the
betrothal kiss.</p>

<p>Diane did not demur when he arose to
go. "I am the daughter of a soldier,"

<!-- page 217 -->

she said proudly. "But you will come
again, Henri, before&mdash;before you
march?" she faltered, breaking down
suddenly, and clinging to him with entreating
hands.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, at eleven, my beloved.
We march at noon. Ah!"</p>

<p>For, as he spoke, the first level rays
from the just-arisen moon fell along the
shadowy alley-way, throwing into startling
relief against a background of foliage
the two white Dianas; and a bird
in the magnolia-tree over against them
broke into a flood of melody, clear, buoyant,
soaring, wonderful.</p>

<p>" 'Tis the zozo moquer," said Diane.</p>

<p>XVI</p>

<p class="small">THE COMPANY OF BACHELORS</p>

</div>

<p>THE troops, the next morning,
under the command of Major
Belleisle were ready to march.
The battalion consisted of six companies
of foot: five composed of white men and
one of free blacks, with a small band
of Colapissa Indians, intended mainly as
scouts, headed by a half-breed of proved
integrity. There was no artillery, the
forced march forbidding the incumbrance
of the clumsy wagons.</p>

<p>The Company of Bachelors were already
assembling at the rendezvous&mdash;the
open stretch of ground between the
Place d'Armes and the river, when de
Valdeterre, after a brief conference with
the chief officer, rode out once more,

<!-- page 219 -->

spurring his horse to full speed, to the
Ch&acirc;teau de la Roche.</p>

<p>The ch&acirc;teau gate was closed and locked;
he beat impatiently upon the bell with the
hammer. A negro in the house-livery,
but unknown to him, answered the summons.
"Mademoiselle de la Roche does
not receive to-day," he said in good
French, barring the way respectfully as
the young man attempted to enter. De
Valdeterre looked at him with haughty
incredulity while he repeated the words;
then, shouldering him aside unceremoniously,
he strode swiftly to the house.</p>

<p>He waited upon the step, for the
house-door, like the gate, was closed and
locked. A second lackey presented himself;
de Valdeterre did not wait for him
to speak; he thrust a visiting-card into
his hand and peremptorily bade him take
it to his mistress. A second later from
the small reception-room on the right of
the hall he heard distinctly the voice of

<!-- page 220 -->

Diane, raised, he divined, purposely, "Say
to Monsieur de Valdeterre," the tones
were clear, cold, and incisive, "that Mademoiselle
de la Roche is not at home."</p>

<p>He stood dumfounded, waiting for the
heavens to fall, while Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute; within
said something in a low voice; he could
not catch the words, but they might have
been conciliatory or remonstrant. For
Diane, again raising her voice, repeated,
"Say to Monsieur de Valdeterre that
Mademoiselle de la Roche is not at
home."</p>

<p>He did not await the messenger.</p>

<p>"Heartless, capricious coquette! was
it worth your while to trample under
your feet yet another? and that other
the man who has already suffered enough
at the hands of your accursed breed?
Gailliard was right. It is safer to hate
you than to love you, Diane! And henceforth
and forever I hate you!"</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • •</p>

<!-- page 221 -->

<p>The battalion marched out of the city
by the Gate St. Louis, and up the Tchoupitoulas
Road, amid the acclamations of
townspeople who had assembled along the
route. At the same time the boats carrying
provisions and ammunition, manned
by stalwart oarsmen, pushed off from the
landing in front of Government House.</p>

<p>The flower of beauty was on the galleries
and balconies lining Levee Street,
as the flower of chivalry was in the rank
and file of the troop. The Company of
Bachelors provoked the wildest enthusiasm
as it swung sturdily past the Palace
where the governor's lady had assembled
her friends, the marquise herself sending
out a guidon which was at once intrusted
by the captain commanding to young
de Courcy. Mademoiselle d'Hauterive
threw down a double handful of roses,
and leaning over the gallery railing,
clapped her white hands and called out a
Godspeed. De Valdeterre, raising his hat

<!-- page 222 -->

in response, saw Diane de la Roche by the
side of Madame de Vaudreuil; her sparkling
eyes were bent on the Baron de
Marquand, who was fastening in his buttonhole
the ribbon she had dropped to his
hand.</p>

<p>"So," growled Gailliard, who was one
of the under-officers, in his captain's ear,
"the Baron de Marquand is the latest
victim. Let the fond fool wear his ribbon.
'Tis the badge of Circe's band!"</p>

<p>"She must have ridden hard upon my
horse's hoofs&mdash;to gloat over my misery,"
thought the captain. He lifted his head
proudly, kissed one of Alys d'Hauterive's
roses, and tossed it back with a
smile to the giver.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>The expedition, making a rapid march,
was joined on the morning of the second
day out by Achille, the free man of
color, who thenceforward served as chief
guide, his long service under his master,

<!-- page 223 -->

the late Chevalier de la Roche, having
made him familiar with the country on
both sides of the Mississippi, from the
lower coast to the upper limit of the Province.
The first two days' march led
through plantations and concessions scattered
many miles apart along the river;
and past several of the small forts erected
and garrisoned during the last administration.
On the third day, still keeping
within a stone's throw of the river and
the fleet, the battalion proceeded with
increasing caution through a hushed and
solitary wilderness&mdash;filled, as the experienced
guide knew well, with terrible
possibilities. The Indian scouts were
thrown out; but not a hostile rifle or a
whizzing arrow disturbed the stillness;
not a skulking redskin on the confines of
the lonely solitude, which was here a
vast reach of mighty forest-trees, there a
stretch of red land with open vistas pillared
with lofty pines; in one place an

<!-- page 224 -->

almost impenetrable canebrake; in another,
a rise of wooded hills.</p>

<p>About noon on the fourth day the
straggling column came to an abrupt
halt; word ran along the line that the
Indian encampment, the object of the expedition,
lay but a few miles ahead; the
scouts reported it to contain between five
and seven hundred of those Natchez and
Chickasaw warriors who for the past several
years had kept the frontier in a state
of apprehension, and a band of whom
had committed the late massacre.</p>

<p>Orders were given for an immediate
attack; the baggage was placed in the
care of a reserve; word was passed to
the boats on the river, and the men
swung forward at a steady pace.</p>

<p>The temporary village, with its inclosing
palisade reinforced by chevaux de
frise along the base, lay at the foot of a
ridge which rose gently behind it; a small
stream with low banks ran diagonally

<!-- page 225 -->

across the natural clearing in front of the
town. As his men emerged at a slow trot
from the sheltering forest, Major Belleisle
marched them across the brook and
threw them at once against the encampment.
They charged, shouting, across
the prairie; an answering yell came from
the hitherto silent village, and hundreds
of half-naked warriors swarmed out.</p>

<p>The combat in the open was terrific;
the Indians used their guns with as much
skill as the French; those unprovided
with the white man's weapon discharged
a murderous hail of arrows. At close
quarters the tomahawk came into play,
and against this savage tool sword and
bayonet were well-nigh useless. It was a
melee so fast and furious that for a time
every man, red or white, fought for himself.
De Valdeterre, first among the
demoralized officers, succeeded in rallying
his men; and placing himself at their
head he cheered them on by voice and

<!-- page 226 -->

example. The Company of Bachelors,
diminishing in numbers with every fresh
assault, seemed to be in a dozen places at
once; their captain appeared to bear a
charmed life; conspicuous among a squad
of savages who opposed him as the French
and their allies were borne backward on
the field, was the young chief Chivonah,
who had brought to the governor the
tidings of the massacre and the impending
raid. His tunic, blanket, and leggings
had been cast off; his tall, supple
form&mdash;nude, except for a breechcloth&mdash;glittered
with red and black paint; his
long scalplock was feathered and bound
with scarlet; demoniac cries issued from
his lips as his sinewy arm rose and fell
in deadly rhythm; the tomahawk in his
hand dropped blood.</p>

<p>De Valdeterre in one unwary moment
turned his head; it was at a groan from
Chapron, who had fallen, his skull cleft
to the neck, at his side; on the instant

<!-- page 227 -->

he felt a sharp pain in his left shoulder,
and at the same time a stinging sensation
in his right thigh. He swayed forward,
fell prone on his face, and the
bloody surge swept over him.</p>

<p>But a turn came in the tide; the French
made a desperate stand on the farther
edge of the brook; the Indians, outmatched,
at length gave way and drew
off sullenly to the village, but dragging
their dead and wounded with them.</p>

<p>The French in their turn retreated
across the stream and re&euml;ntered the forest.
Among the dead brought in from the
clearing were young de Courcy, with the
bloody guidon still grasped in his stiffening
fingers, de Coulanges, St. Ange, and
Guyot. De Valdeterre, Breaux, de Contre
C&oelig;ur, and Allain were seriously wounded;
the two companies of blacks and the band
of Colapissas had likewise suffered heavy
losses. Trenches were dug and the dead
hastily buried; the wounded looked to.</p>

<!-- page 228 -->

<p>"Something is brewing yonder," said
Major Belleisle after a time, looking out
toward the encampment. "I know the
red devils of old. Their silence is ominous.
I wish we could draw them forth
again. I cannot risk another assault."</p>

<p>The sun had set; the soft gray of approaching
twilight brooded over the
scene; the clearing, with its bloody,
trampled sod was as tranquil as a deserted
field. No sound came from the
village, not even the customary howl of
the tribesmen over their dead. The
French camp, save for the groans of the
wounded, maintained an equal silence.</p>

<p>The negro Achille, seated by the unconscious
de Valdeterre, and stanching
his bleeding wounds, seemed stirred by
some inward anxiety; his lips moved,
and a frown furrowed his dark brow. At
Major Belleisle's words he looked up,
then off toward the village; then he rose
quickly to his feet.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 229 -->

<div class="center" id="ch17">

<p>XVII</p>

<p class="small">THE WHITE MARE</p>

</div>

<p>A TROOP of horses had come down
the wooded slope beyond the village,
and deceived by the unruffled
repose of the hour, advanced at a
swift trot across the clearing. It was led
by a graceful mare, spotlessly white, who,
with her beautiful head lifted, stopped
like one on watch on the farther bank of
the brook some fifty yards above where
the French were lying.</p>

<p>The negro Achille had already unwound
from about his waist the leathern
thong which served as a belt; coiling it
in his right hand he flew with the speed
of an arrow parted from the string to
where the horses stood quietly slaking
their thirst in the shallow, rippling water.

<!-- page 230 -->

They scattered, snorting, at his approach;
the mare beyond kept her ground one
instant too long. She wheeled, but the
negro had already cleared the brook at a
jump; he leaped lightly into the air and
settled himself easily upon her back. She
reared and plunged madly, uttering terrified
cries; he leaned forward, grasping
her flowing mane with one hand, and with
the other knotted the leather thong about
her mouth; then, pressing his knees
against her flanks, he forced her across
the clearing. His colossal figure, startlingly
black against the snowy whiteness
of the wild creature he bestrode, was
erect and centaur-like in its repose. The
French held their breath as he pressed
the frantic animal on, and jerked her to
a halt that threw her back upon her
haunches, directly under the palisade of
the village.</p>

<p>There he lifted his stentorian voice in
a shout of defiance:&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 231 -->

<p>"Come out, dogs of Natchez, skunks
of Chickasaws!" he cried in the language
common to all the Indian tribes
of the South. "Are you women, that
you hide in your lodges in terror of the
palefaces?"</p>

<p>The silence in the village attested to
the superstitious awe in which the White
Mare, hitherto untouched by the hand
of man, was held by the people who had
cherished her as sacred from a colt.</p>

<p>Again the challenger on his rearing
steed roared a prolonged menace, or a
taunt, or an appeal,&mdash;it might have been
all three,&mdash;for this time no one in the
French camp, not even the Colapissas,
understood the strange guttural tongue
in which it was uttered. Then, whirling
his horse, he thundered back to the forest,
bending low to the mare's neck, for
a hail of bullets and arrows followed
him. He crossed the stream and dropped
unhurt to the ground on the hither side.

<!-- page 232 -->

The mare, loosened from his hand, tore
away unmolested.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p class="small">[<sup>1</sup>This episode of the negro and the mare is
founded upon an incident related by Gayarr&eacute; in
his <i>History of Louisiana:</i> Lecture VI.]</p>

<p>Before the flying white cloud had regained
the ridge, the savages poured
shrieking from the encampment, a horde
of painted demons. A second time the
small plain became for a brief space a
bloody pandemonium; but a second time
repulsed by the French who charged out
to meet them, the Indians returned to
the shelter of their palisades.</p>

<p>Major Belleisle, in consultation with his
officers, summed up his losses and calculated
the chances of a third and night
sortie: he reluctantly gave the order for
a retreat as far as the baggage-camp and
fresh ammunition.</p>

<p>Again the trenches were opened and
the dead hidden as skillfully as possible
from the savages; the wounded were

<!-- page 233 -->

placed in improvised litters, and the silent
backward march began.</p>

<p>Achille lifted de Valdeterre, still unconscious,
in his powerful arms, refusing
the proffered aid of Gailliard and others,
and stepped easily along with his burden.
The moon had not yet arisen; the men,
spent and wearied, stumbled their way
through the vast and gloomy forest, the
rear guard following with wary feet, and
ears and eyes alert.</p>

<p>Something more than a mile from the
village the negro turned aside, unnoticed,
and plunged into the heavy underbrush
that stretched along at the right of
the moving column; half an hour later
he came out on the bank of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>He laid the insensible man gently down
on the rank dew-wet grass and walked
cautiously down the slope of the bank.
A woman arose to meet him by the reedy
edge of the river.</p>

<!-- page 234 -->

<p>"La Temp&ecirc;te?" he breathed inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Why have you called me from the
Lodge of Death where I was crooning
the Song of the Slain for my people?"
she asked, in French, in a low, sombre
voice; "and why should I come forth to
carry a white brave to the Island of the
Half-Living?"</p>

<p>"La Temp&ecirc;te!" he repeated, relieved.
"I knew when I called you in the name
of the Great Chevalier, that you would
come." He had stooped to unwind the
rope which attached a canoe to a young
willow-tree. "The white brave is here.
But he is beyond your skill. La Temp&ecirc;te:
he will die. And the daughter of the
Great Chevalier will weep."</p>

<p>"Ah! it is that? Then were he a dog,
or a Choctaw, he shall not die. Fetch
him."</p>

<p>The order was imperative. She unloosened
the blanket from her shoulders

<!-- page 235 -->

and spread it in the bottom of the boat,
and stepped in. Achille laid the young
captain on the blanket, with his head on
her knees; and seating himself, picked
up the paddle. He looked anxiously over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>"There is no danger," said the Indian
woman. "The chiefs are assembled in
the Council Lodge. My son, the young
Chivonah, sits in council with them," she
added proudly.</p>

<p>The canoe, under the skilled paddle of
the negro, was skimming athwart the
rapid current of the river; the waves
shimmered in the starlight.</p>

<p>"Machengo!" The exclamation burst
from the woman's lips. The negro ceased
paddling for a second and looked over at
her.</p>

<p>" 'Tis a long time," he said slowly,
"since any tongue hath spoken the name
the king, my father, gave me in Africa.
But thou, La Temp&ecirc;te, hast not forgotten

<!-- page 236 -->

it. And thou hast not forgotten the language
of my fathers that I taught thee
before the Great Chevalier departed to
the Land of Spirits. So that when I
called to thee over the palisades, for the
sake of the Chevalier's daughter, thou
knewest." He bent to his task again.</p>

<p>"Machengo, thou art bleeding: thou,
too, art wounded."</p>

<p>"What of that? 'Tis but the scratch
of an arrow." He shot the canoe as he
spoke into a cove of the small densely
wooded island that stretched its narrow
length along the middle of the river.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>At midnight the allied Natchez and
Chickasaws swooped down on the French
camp; the fight, the last for many months,
was an utter rout for the Indians, who
fled to their encampment, gathered up
their women and children, and disappeared,
after their wonted fashion, into
the untrodden fastnesses. They carried

<!-- page 237 -->

several captives with them; among those
supposed to have fallen into their hands
were the captain of the Company of
Bachelors, and the free man of color,
Achille.</p>

<p>The battalion, victorious, but sadly
thinned by its victory, set out at once on
its return march to New Orleans.</p>

<p>XVIII</p>

<p class="small">AT THE URSULINES</p>

</div>

<p>THE morning after Henri de
Valdeterre and Diane de la
Koche plighted, in the moon-lighted
plaisance, their mutual troth,
an early visitor came to the ch&acirc;teau.
This was Delaup, who rode directly from
Government House, while his resignation
was still sharing public interest
with the approaching departure of the
troops for the Indian country. If there
had been any sign of discomfiture on
his face, or in his small enigmatical
eyes, he had succeeded in banishing
all trace of it before he arose to greet
Mademoiselle de la Roche when she
entered the boudoir where he awaited
her.</p>

<!-- page 239 -->

<p>"I ask a thousand pardons, mademoiselle,"
he said, bending low over the hand
she gave him, "for my early visit,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>A deprecatory murmur reassured him.
She had seated herself in a high-backed
chair and was looking at him with a
divine smile. She had never been so
beautiful, so gracious, so yielding! She
did not, in truth, even see the under-secretary;
her eyes were filled with an
inner vision; her ears were strained to
catch the hoof-beats of de Valdeterre's
horse, although it wanted fully an hour
to the appointed time.</p>

<p>"I wished," Delaup went on easily,
"to be the first to communicate to you
an important piece of news&mdash;important
at least to myself, and, I dare hope, mademoiselle,
to you. I have resigned the
secretaryship."</p>

<p>"Ah?" said Diane, with perfunctory
interest in her voice, but the misleading

<!-- page 240 -->

smile still on her lips. "Then you follow
Aide-Major Belleisle to the wars."</p>

<p>"No," He bit his lips, disconcerted
for an instant; but he resumed quietly:
"No. However much I may desire to
march with the troops, there are other
duties . . . the governor"&mdash;his somewhat
mysterious tone intimated a secret
understanding with his excellency&mdash;"I
wished to tell you this myself. Besides,
my longing to see you&mdash;after yesterday&mdash;was
so great&mdash;"</p>

<p>Diane stared at him. What did the
man mean? What had Delaup, or any
soul alive, save only Henri de Valdeterre
and herself, have to do with yesterday?</p>

<p>"&mdash;If I read overmuch in your eyes,
there by the field of fleurs-de-lis&mdash;" he
could not but see that his listener's attention
had wandered. Her thoughts, indeed,
had traveled swiftly out to that marvelous
field of lilies; she saw herself looking
into a pair of dark, reproachful

<!-- page 241 -->

eyes; she felt a sudden pang that the
blue lily, dropped from her lover's hand,
should have been left to wither on the
green turf&mdash;</p>

<p>"Diane!" a sudden passion shook
Delaup's voice, "I love you. I have
come to tell you this, and to ask you to
be my wife."</p>

<p>She regarded him in stupefied silence.
For once la belle Diane was taken unawares.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;Monsieur Delaup," she stammered,&mdash;"I&mdash;I&mdash;it
is impossible. Nay,
do not come nearer. I am indeed honored
by your preference, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stay," he interrupted imploringly.
"Do not send me away now. If you but
knew&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon, monsieur," she interrupted
in her turn, with genuine distress in her
voice, "I beg you to cease. It is impossible."</p>

<p>The blood mounted to his forehead.</p>

<!-- page 242 -->

<p>"Listen, mademoiselle, I beg of you," he
urged. "I am rich, richer far than you
imagine&mdash;"</p>

<p>A haughty movement of her head gave
a fatal impetus to his speech. "Oh, I
am aware, mademoiselle, that this means
nothing to you&mdash;now. But sooner than
you think you will need some one upon
whom you may lean for protection, nay,
even for food and shelter."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she demanded,
amazed.</p>

<p>"I mean," he returned, looking steadily
at her, "that an enemy of your house
has sought and obtained from his majesty
an order which sweeps out of your
possession into his the ch&acirc;teau; and not
the ch&acirc;teau alone, but your slaves, your
plantations&mdash;everything belonging to
the family of la Roche. I mean that the
man who has done you this wrong is
about to exercise his infamous but legal
right, and&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 243 -->

<p>"And who, may I ask," she broke in
frowning, though far from taking in the
full significance of his words, "who, may
I ask, is this man?"</p>

<p>"The man? The traitor? Yes, mademoiselle.
The man is the Vicomte de
Valdeterre."</p>

<p>"It is false!" she flashed, springing
to her feet, her bosom heaving, her angry
eyes aflame. "It is false! I do not believe
it! I would not believe it if a thousand
tongues like yours cried it aloud.
The Vicomte de Valdeterre is incapable
of such treachery."</p>

<p>"You will nevertheless believe the signature
of his majesty, and the Great
Seal of France." He drew from his
bosom a folded paper with the seal attached
by a ribbon, and held it out to
her. She took the paper and glanced
over it. It was a duplicate of the order
already in de Valdeterre's possession,
but included certain paragraphs not in

<!-- page 244 -->

the original. It bore the date February
13, 1752.</p>

<p>"Neither do I believe the signature
of his majesty nor the Great Seal of
France," said Diane contemptuously.
"Have you said all, Monsieur Delaup?"
She moved toward the door, the paper
still in her hand.</p>

<p>For answer he followed her and handed
her an open letter addressed to the Vicomte
de Valdeterre, in the care of Governor
the Marquis de Vaudreuil; it bore
the signature of a court official whose
name was well known in the Province.</p>

<p>"My dear Henri," the writer began,
"I send you by request of his majesty's
private secretary an order rendering null
and void the one issued to you in August
of last year, before you sailed from France
for Louisiana; this being rendered expedient
by news of the death of the Chevalier
de la Roche lately come to court.
You will find your privileges somewhat

<!-- page 245 -->

curtailed in this matter, but there remains
to you a handsome portion, especially
as it now transpires that the exiled
la Roche knew the secret of some rich
mines out there. You will doubtless take
possession at once. You will need no
urging, since from your late letters I
understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand"&mdash;Diane turned the
page and read on to the end. "How
came you in possession of these papers,
monsieur?" she asked, refolding the letter
with great deliberation.</p>

<p>Delaup, emboldened by her change of
tone, hastened to answer, a trifle triumphantly,
"I found means to come at the
piece of villainy,&mdash;means justified, as I
know you will agree, by de Valdeterre's
knavery."</p>

<p>"Monsieur Delaup," Diane's tone had
become cutting and scornful, "you have
indeed this day unmasked three villains;
the first and greatest yourself, who have

<!-- page 246 -->

stolen&mdash;yes, monsieur, I repeat the
word!&mdash;stolen this private correspondence;
the second, myself, who have
stooped to the baseness of reading what
was not intended for my eyes; and lastly,
Monsieur de Valdeterre, who at least has
the excuse of being my enemy."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For him," she continued, regardless
of the interruption, "he may exercise his
rights when he will. I shall not lift a finger
to prevent. For myself, I shall commit
the further baseness of keeping these
stolen papers. For you, monsieur, go."</p>

<p>"You will not keep those papers,
mademoiselle!" he cried, approaching
her, his face swollen with rage.</p>

<p>"Not one step nearer, monsieur!" She
laid her hand on the bell-rope. "Go at
once, or I call."</p>

<p>His eyes fell before the steely glitter
of hers. He slunk slowly out and away.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<!-- page 247 -->

<p>After de Valdeterre had come to the
ch&acirc;teau on his bootless errand of love,
and gone again, Diane passed into the
room where Madame de Ste. Hermine,
seated at the harpsichord, was practicing
the "Lover's Madrigal" with Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;.
The storm which had shaken the young
chatelaine of La Roche to the soul had
left her lovely eyes dimmed and her
cheeks pale, but her manner had lost
none of its imperious grace.</p>

<p>"Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;," she declared, when she
had made the old henchman fully acquainted
with the affair, and had given
him the king's order to read&mdash;reserving
the letter, however,&mdash;"I shall not stay
another hour in Monsieur de Valdeterre's
house."</p>

<p>"But, my dear Diane&mdash;" he began,
clearing his throat for argument.</p>

<p>"Not one word!" she cried, with an
impatient stamp of her foot. "I am decided."</p>

<!-- page 248 -->

<p>"Madame de Ste. Hermine&mdash;" he
began again, with an apprehensive look
at that unconscious lady, whose yellow
fingers still strayed over the yellow keys
of the harpsichord.</p>

<p>"You will see that arrangements are
made for Madame de Ste. Hermine to be
carried in her chair this day to the Convent
of the Ursulines," interrupted Diane.</p>

<p>The Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute; obstinately maintained
that the move, if it must be made,
should at least be taken in a more seemly
fashion, as became the ladies of la Roche;
that they should take temporary quarters
with those friends in Rue Royale with
whom they usually passed the night (as
on the night of the f&ecirc;te des rois at the
palace) when they desired to attend a
rout or a masquerade; that they should
most certainly wait until later in the day,
or until the wearing apparel of madame
and mademoiselle could be packed.</p>

<p>All this to no avail. Diane, flying about

<!-- page 249 -->

from room to room, stormed like a lovely
young Fury, with the gaunt dancing
master at her heels essaying coaxing, remonstrance,
philosophy, downright abuse.
She burst finally into a flood of tears,
protesting between sobs that Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;,
like the rest of the world, like the vindictive
and bloodthirsty de Valdeterre
himself, wished to drive her to madness
or self-destruction!</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," said B&eacute;b&eacute; in his high-keyed
voice, but with great dignity,
"you are unjust."</p>

<p>"I know it, d-dear Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;! Please
forg-g-give me."</p>

<p>"I never thought to see you so very a
woman, mademoiselle. It is time you recalled
the Little Chevalier."</p>

<p>"Oh, the Little Chevalier!" cried
Diane scornfully.</p>

<p>And so it was that Madame Amenaide
de Ste. Hermine, who, because the
Grand Monarque had once upon a time

<!-- page 250 -->

admired her in a sedan chair, had ever
since refused to take a coach,&mdash;was
borne before noontide by stalwart chairmen
to the Convent of the Ursulines,
where she was received with the respect
due her position and comfortably bestowed,
and where her great-great-niece
joined her, after witnessing the departure
of the troops for the Indian country
from the gallery of the Palace.</p>

<p>Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute; remained at the ch&acirc;teau
to overlook the slaves of Monsieur de
Valdeterre&mdash;for so the beautiful Diane
designated her faithful blacks.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Vaudreuil had an interview
with his ward at the convent,
from which he returned to Government
House silent and preoccupied; but governor
and ward kept their own counsel;
and in the anxious days which followed
the marching of the troops, little was
said of the latest, most mysterious caprice
of la belle Diane.</p>

<!-- page 251 -->

<p>One morning, some six days and a half
after the Company of Bachelors and their
fellow soldiers stepped forth from the
Porte St. Louis, Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute; rang at the
gate bell of the Convent of the Ursulines.
The convent, built for the order some
twenty years earlier,&mdash;the stained glass
window over the door bears the date
1734,&mdash;stood, and still stands, a venerable
but sturdy relic of French colonial
days, in Chartres Street, then Cond&eacute;.
Its broad fa&ccedil;ade, with the small pillared
porch, looked down then as now on a
grassy court; through the wide door
glimpses could be had across the large
hall of a garden in the rear, laid out in
prim squares planted with vegetables and
herbs, and bordered with young orange-trees.
The high fence in front was
broken by a porter's lodge; here on a
cypress settle Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute; seated himself
to await Mademoiselle de la Roche.</p>

<p>She came out of the convent, a picture

<!-- page 252 -->

of freshness and bloom in her white
morning-gown.</p>

Chagrin d'amour dure toute la vie</i>,"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>she sang as she came; her gay voice in
the old chanson blending with the monotonous
voices of the nuns chanting in the
convent chapel a hymn to the Virgin.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;," she cried,
entering the lodge. "What news from
the troops,&mdash;and the Baron de Marquand?"</p>

<p>"There hath been a fight," returned
the dancing master soberly. "I know not
whether the Baron de Marquand be hurt
or no. But 'tis said&mdash;though the news
is yet in the air&mdash;that the captain of the
Bachelors&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I pray he hath been trussed by an
arrow, or that a fortunate bullet hath
lodged in his arm," interrupted Diane
gayly.</p>

<p>"&mdash;That the captain of the Company

<!-- page 253 -->

of Bachelors," continued Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;,
"hath been killed."</p>

<p>Diane sank upon the bench beside him
pale and trembling. "And the baron?"
she demanded, her hand pressed to her
heart.</p>

<p>"I know not, as I have said. Doubtless&mdash;why,
God in Heaven! Achille!"</p>

<p>He sprang up. It was indeed the gigantic
figure of Achille which darkened
the doorway; he lunged forward as he
crossed the threshold, and would have
fallen but for B&eacute;b&eacute;, who threw an arm
around him, and eased him gently to
the floor. The poor fellow's garments
were covered with blood from the reopened
wound in his breast. His eyes
rolled wildly; he gasped painfully for
breath.</p>

<p>"Achille! my poor Achille!" sobbed
Diane, dropping to her knees and lifting
his head to her arm.</p>

<p>"A bandage at once, sister," said Sieur

<!-- page 254 -->

B&eacute;b&eacute; to the portress, "and unguents.
Stay, I will go myself."</p>

<p>But the negro caught at his sleeve and
fixed entreating eyes upon him. "La
Temp&ecirc;te mo disait&mdash;" he murmured with
an effort.</p>

<p>At the name Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute; knelt again,
and leaning over placed his ear close to
the lips of the dying man. The message,
delivered in the familiar patois, was interrupted
by unconscious lapses into that
strange tongue, with which, sitting on the
back of the white mare, he had summoned
the Indian woman from the encampment.
But it was soon finished, and as the last
word left his lips, life struggled to follow.</p>

<p>A tremor shook the great limbs, the
glazed eyes sought first the face of the
dancing master, whose own eyes were
streaming with tears; then that of Diane,
pale with anguish: "li bon ami," he
whispered to the one, " 'Tite ma&icirc;tresse!"

<!-- page 255 -->

to the other. Suddenly an ecstatic smile
illumined the African features and transformed
them into nobility.</p>

<p>"Mo vois le Grand Chevalier!" he
cried, making an effort to rise. "Mo venin,
ma&icirc;tre!" (I see the Great Chevalier! I
am coming, master!)</p>

<p>The giant body fell back lifeless; the
great soul had followed that beckoning
hand.</p>

<p>XIX</p>

<p class="small">DREAMS</p>

</div>

<p>"IF what you say is true, Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;&mdash;"
the voice, low and musical, trembled
with some undefined emotion. But
that it lacked a certain note of mockery,
it had been strangely familiar.</p>

<p>"Nay, this time, unhappily, it is no question
of a swoon from overfasting; or of
a body without a scratch from head to
heels. There are, I tell you, five distinct
cuts; the man might as well be a tree
hacked by a forester! Each one of his
wounds ought, by all rights, to have been
mortal; and would have been, but for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aha, and this time, too," thought de
Valdeterre, roused from slumber to complete
consciousness by the piccolo-voice;
"this time I know well enough where I

<!-- page 257 -->

am. I shall presently, but not just yet,
open my eyes. Over yonder, across the
room, a fire is dancing in the fireplace;
the light from the flames plays on the
high brass fender and the tall firedogs.
Above the mantel a pair of rapiers are
crossed beneath the portrait of the Chevalier
de la Roche&mdash;the Great Chevalier.
Behind the headboard of the bed where
I am lying, the Little Chevalier, impudent
puppy! is in hiding; and beside me, with
a silver cup in his hand, stands Monsieur
Dominique Etienne Betancourt, otherwise
the Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;."</p>

<p>"&mdash;But for the skill and the devotion
of La Temp&ecirc;te,"&mdash;the speaker had evidently
moved away from the bed, for the
concluding sentence, spoken after a pause,
came from a greater distance.</p>

<p>"The Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute; has stepped to the
pot on the hearth for another draught of
the elixir," reasoned the young captain.
He lifted his heavy eyelids.</p>

<!-- page 258 -->

<p>His conjecture was correct: Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;
was approaching, cup in hand. He slipped
an arm under his patient's head, and presented
the cup to his lips. De Valdeterre
looked into the kindly, quizzical face;
then his gaze sought the dancing flames
in the fireplace, the procession of Greek
nymphs winding their way to the white
temple, the portrait of the Great Chevalier.</p>

<p>His eyes fell instead upon green masses
of pine foliage, waving to and fro majestically
against a blue sky; lower, the
straight purple trunks, with background
of bay and blossoming dogwood. A cluster
of tall ferns with nodding fronds
grew at the foot of his couch. He looked
at all this questioningly; then at the tall
Indian woman who stood with her back
against a pine, her blanket hanging from
her shoulders, her arms crossed on her
breast&mdash;and he remembered.</p>

<p>At the moment the negro Achille lifted

<!-- page 259 -->

him from the canoe on the night of the
Indian fight, consciousness returned to
him. He saw the stars overhead, and felt
against his face, as he was borne rapidly
through the underbrush on the island,
the wet, sweet leaves of the bay; he
heard the soughing of the night-wind in
the tall pines. Achille laid him down
upon the deerskin couch, which the woman
stalking ahead like a shadow had
hastily prepared. The two spoke together
in low murmurs, leaving him to the sharp
agony which wrenched his body with
returning sensibility; then the negro
plunged again into the thicket and disappeared.</p>

<p>The woman gave him to drink from a
gourd. The draught brought to him, before
he sank again into oblivion, a hazy
remembrance of the Ch&acirc;teau de la
Roche.</p>

<p>Since that night, as often as he awoke,
he found La Temp&ecirc;te, the great medicine-woman

<!-- page 260 -->

of the Chickasaws, brooding over
him with sombre face and deep, anxious
eyes. Her name had come to him as if
by intuition, though he might have heard
it spoken by Achille as he drew back
to consciousness. She soothed his impatience
as one soothes a sick child, speaking
French of singular purity, and with
perfect ease. His wounds, which she
dressed with the softest and deftest fingers,
gave him little pain; he felt them
healing hourly; he knew at the end of
a few days that if he cared he might at
least sit up in his fern-girdled bed.</p>

<p>But he did not care; an immense
weariness of life had seized him. His
thoughts, which for months had hovered,
insistent, puzzled, angry, joyous, outraged,
around Diane de la Roche, still
hovered around that radiant centre; but
they had become powerless to charm, or
to agonize&mdash;pale and lifeless wraith of
once mighty emotions.</p>

<!-- page 261 -->

<p>"Hol&agrave;, Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;," he now said, with
a momentary thrill of interest. "How
came you here?"</p>

<p>"I am here, monsieur le vicomte,"
returned the dancing master seriously,
"for the purpose of studying, in the interest
of my two professions, to wit, dancing
and medicine, the effect of certain
herbs and potions on the human body,
when it hath been subjected to the play
of sundry of the angry passions at the
hands of its fellows; as exemplified in
warfare, particularly in savage warfare,
in the which arrows and tomahawks
are used as well as the more civilized
rifle."</p>

<p>Long before the slowly uttered sentence
had come to a period, the captain
of the Bachelors had closed his eyes and
lay pale and motionless under the speaker's
eyes. The Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute; abruptly
abandoned his learned discourse, waited
a while in silence, and then beckoned

<!-- page 262 -->

with his hand to La Temp&ecirc;te. She quitted
her place and moved to his side with
a stately step.</p>

<p>The Chickasaw princess was at this
time about forty years of age. She had
been beautiful; she still retained much
of that charm of form and feature which
had had its share in giving her the extraordinary
ascendancy among her people
which she had enjoyed from her girlhood,
and which she maintained to the
day of her death. She was of a commanding
height, slenderly built, and of
almost perfect proportions. Her skin,
of a warm brown tinged with red, was
smooth as ivory, or the petal of the magnolia.
Her eyes, which looked out from
a profusion of unbound black locks, were
dark and piercing, inspiring a feeling of
awe; her high cheekbones gave a look of
sternness to an otherwise softly rounded
face. Her hands and feet were small
and of exquisite slenderness.</p>

<!-- page 263 -->

<p>Her dress, unlike that of most Indian
women, was without ornament, except
for the thread of scarlet,&mdash;indication of
her high rank,&mdash;drawn through the hem
of her tunic, and the fancifully embroidered
moccasins on her feet.</p>

<p>"La Temp&ecirc;te," said the Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;,
"the wounds of the young man are almost
healed, thanks to thy skill. The poultices
of ground-ivy and the baths of copal have
wrought a miracle. He should, as I have
told thee many times already, according
to all human calculation, have died."</p>

<p>"Said I not to Machengo that the
young man should not die?" returned
the woman in a low, even voice.</p>

<p>De Valdeterre heard. He heard also,
or he thought he heard, a light sigh behind
the blanket which sheltered the
head of his bed from the wind. But he
made no sign.</p>

<p>"True," assented B&eacute;b&eacute;. "Still, I marvel
at thy art. It hath but become more

<!-- page 264 -->

potent with the passing of years. But
as thou seest, La Temp&ecirc;te, the youth
thou hast snatched from death and whose
wounds are so quickly healed, doth not
drink freshness and strength from the
elixir, as should follow. Moreover," he
laid his large hand lightly on de Valdeterre's
forehead and felt his wrist with
tentative finger-tips,&mdash;" moreover, his
fever hath been steadily mounting this
hour past."</p>

<p>"I know," replied La Temp&ecirc;te; "it is
not the body. Thinkest thou, Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;,
that I see not beyond the wall of flesh
that veils the spirit? There is something
which gnaws like a wolf at the young
chief's heart."</p>

<p>" 'Tis the zozo moquer," said de
Valdeterre unexpectedly, opening fever-bright
eyes, and staring with incipient
delirium in his gaze at the two figures,
towering monstrous, grotesque, formidable,
above his bed.</p>

<!-- page 265 -->

<p>" 'Tis the zozo moquer," he repeated
angrily.</p>

<p>And then he slept, and dreamed strange
dreams.</p>

<p>In one of these dreams he seemed to
himself to awake, and to lie under the
starlit sky which showed in velvety
patches between the dark pine-tops, and
so lying, to live over the hurried march
at the head of his men to the Indian fort,
and the bloody fight, with the bullets
screaming above the tumultuous yell of
the savages; and Chapron, his old Chapron,
tumbling headless to the ground at
his feet; and Achille on the white mare
under the palisaded wall; and the Indian
woman bending over him, with her tragic
face looking out of long, loose locks of
night-black hair; and Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute; giving
him to drink from a silver cup. As he
lay thinking on all this, there burst suddenly
upon the night-air a wail&mdash;shrill,
prolonged, mournful&mdash;that now was close

<!-- page 266 -->

at hand, and now falling and far away.
He trembled (in his dream) on the deerskin
couch; and a rose-leaf fell on his
forehead. . . .</p>

<p>Again after many years he opened his
eyes into the soft light of late afternoon;
this he knew (in his dream) by the shadows
on a certain purple pine-trunk; the
Little Chevalier, wrapped in his long
cloak, his brow shaded by his broad hat,
was keeping watch&mdash;alone&mdash;beside him.
The blue eyes were brooding; the young
face was pale, as if the boy had been ill.</p>

<p>"My Little Chevalier!" he cried,
"and what do you here in the forest?"</p>

<p>The Little Chevalier leaned over and
laid a cooling hand on his cheek. . . .</p>

<p>Other many years went by, and once
more (in his dream) the Little Chevalier
sat by his couch&mdash;alone; this time the
midnight wind was damp, and the lad
drew the bed-covering over him and set
the cup of elixir to his lips.</p>

<!-- page 267 -->

<p>"Little Chevalier, why do you tend
me?" he demanded. "I deemed you my
enemy."</p>

<p>"And so I am," returned the lad, "and
therefore I tend you. For look you, Monsieur
de Valdeterre, you shall not die
until you have visited me once again in
my garden."</p>

<p>"Ah, my Little Chevalier! That is
spoken with the honesty of a true man.
But, your sister Diane&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My sister Diane is a saucy jade." A
frown furrowed the smooth white brow.
"She is not worth your thought, monsieur
le vicomte."</p>

<p>"It is the zozo moquer," whispered the
captain mysteriously, drawing the boy's
face close to his own fever-burnt cheek.</p>

<p>XX</p>

<p class="small">THE ISLAND: OY&Emacr;-CHI-CHI-TA</p>

</div>

<p>WHEN the captain of the Bachelors,
on a fresh May morning,
awoke at one and the same
time from these curious dreams, and
from the fever which for many days
had burned in his veins, he found himself
alone with the Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;.</p>

<p>That individual, seated on the ground
with his back against a pine-tree, and his
long legs stretched out before him, was
beating the air with a bony hand, and
nodding his bared head in time to the
gavotte which he hummed between his
teeth; his eyes were closed, his lean
face expressed profound satisfaction.</p>

<p>De Valdeterre, keeping a wary look
upon him, quickly and furtively lifted a

<!-- page 269 -->

fold of the blanket which hung at the
head of his bed, and dropped it. "Not
even the ghost of a Little Chevalier, this
time!" he murmured.</p>

<p>He cleared his throat loudly, and without
awaiting a response from the dancing
master he sat up; he felt no pain,
only a slight giddiness. A sense of exhilaration
had succeeded to the dull melancholy
which for so long had pervaded
his whole being. He made no effort to
analyze this change, but uttered a second
and deeper "hem," grinning like a mischievous
schoolboy. Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute; conscientiously
rounded the airy phrase he had
reached to a period, and opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Hol&agrave;! my dear vicomte," he called
cheerfully; "you arrive exactly at the
right moment. I was expecting you.
Pardieu! but you have the rosy air of
a page!" He gathered up his legs, got
upon his feet, and bowed with great
ceremony.</p>

<!-- page 270 -->

<p>De Valdeterre also stood up; he essayed
to return the salute, but his knees
bent under him, and he sank perforce to
the couch.</p>

<p>"Not yet, monsieur, for the love of
God!" cried the dancing master, dropping
his bantering tone and hurrying
forward. "Why, man, are you so in love
with Oy&emacr;-chi-chi-ta that you wish to remain
here yet another fortnight?"</p>

<p>"An I were not fasting, Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;,"
said the captain defiantly, "I could at
this moment step a pavane with any
page of his majesty's court. But you
said yourself that a man fasting is but
the half of a man!"</p>

<p>"True," returned B&eacute;b&eacute;, already busied
behind the great pine where he had been
sitting; "and truer still it is that a man
hungry hath not a particular stomach."
He drew near again, a wooden platter in
one hand and a cup in the other. "Nevertheless,
monsieur will have the goodness

<!-- page 271 -->

to pardon the coarseness of his diet.
Also the want of that heat which man
in a civilized state deems necessary to
the savor of his food."</p>

<p>The platter contained a loaf of bread
and a bit of jerked venison; the cup
was filled with coffee, strong and palatable,
but cold.</p>

<p>The young man ate ravenously, beseeching
his companion, almost with tearful
eyes, when the platter was swept
clean, for more.</p>

<p>"Such a meal as Lucullus might well
invite himself to," he declared, when, at
a warning wave of the bony hand, he
desisted. "Methinks with such food, and
such a companion,"&mdash;the sieur inclined
his head courteously,&mdash;"I could dwell
forever in&mdash;how call you the place,
Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;?"</p>

<p>"Oy&emacr;-chi-chi-ta, which in the Chickasaw
tongue signifies the Island of the
Half-Living," replied the sieur. "It is

<!-- page 272 -->

the place where, according to their belief,
the souls of their dead tarry a while
on their way to the Land Beyond. Also
those who travel to the very border of
that land because of grievous wounds
had in battle; but who may yet by a
mighty effort grasp the parting spirit
with an outstretched hand and tether
it again to the body; and so return to
the wigwam and the warpath. The red
man, monsieur, is not afraid of the dead,
but he stands in terror of the mysterious
Half-Living, who may or may not
come back to his lodge. This is why he
shuns this island in the Mississippi, and
why those upon it are secure from
molestation. Nevertheless," he added
thoughtfully, "it were not wise to permit
smoke to ascend from Oy&emacr;-chi-chi-ta.
Therefore, monsieur, I bake and brew
only in the night-time."</p>

<p>De Valdeterre had listened with profound
interest; he further learned that

<!-- page 273 -->

the island was a small one&mdash;a narrow
strip on the wide sweep of the river, not
far below the ill-fated Fort Rosalie, desolated
by the Natchez in 1729.</p>

<p>"You may walk at your ease over the
island," continued Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;,&mdash;"for I
surmise that even at this moment you are
longing to try your legs,&mdash;provided you
keep well within the encircling thickets.
You might otherwise be picked off from
the shore by the arrow of some skulking
Natchez or Chickasaw spy, notwithstanding
his awe of Oy&emacr;-chi-chi-ta."</p>

<p>His listener inquired eagerly after his
comrades and the result of the expedition.</p>

<p>The campaign, as already recorded,
had ended in a midnight melee, in which
the French were victorious; the Indians
had disappeared with several captives
into the wilderness; and Major Belleisle
had marched his troops back to New
Orleans. The captives&mdash;among whom

<!-- page 274 -->

the captain of the Bachelors was at first
supposed to be numbered&mdash;had been tortured
and put to death; the chiefs,
alarmed by the threat of the governor,
had since sent an equal number of their
own young men to suffer death in the
Place d'Armes by way of indemnification;
and had besought humbly to be
allowed to smoke the pipe of peace with
the Great White Chief.</p>

<p>" 'Tis but to gain time for further
deviltry," remarked the sieur in conclusion.
"I marvel that his excellency consents
to parley with the dogs."</p>

<p>"Strange," commented de Valdeterre,
musing on his own miraculous escape
from torture and death; "strange that
the negro Achille should have so saved
me at the expense of his own life, poor
fellow! But I remember that he had
shown a sort of devotion to me of late.
Doubtless I had for the gigantic black
one of those inexplicable attractions

<!-- page 275 -->

which one human being sometimes has
for another."</p>

<p>Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute; smiled wisely behind his
palm, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"But La Temp&ecirc;te?" demanded the
young man; "what interest had La Temp&ecirc;te
in a stranger like myself?"</p>

<p>"La Temp&ecirc;te," replied B&eacute;b&eacute;, "came
to you for the sake of Achille, who befriended
her in many ways in the days
of the Great Chevalier. Besides, you
were not the only man brought to Oy&emacr;-chi-chi-ta
after those bloody fights."</p>

<p>"Then," cried the captain eagerly,
"there are others of the Half-Living on
the island?"</p>

<p>"There was another."</p>

<p>"Not the Little Chevalier," de Valdeterre
said to himself with conviction.
"That was a dream."</p>

<p>Seeing that B&eacute;b&eacute; said no more, he proceeded
in his catechism. "And you, Monsieur
de Betancourt? It could not have

<!-- page 276 -->

been for me that you came, but for&mdash;
that other?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Vicomte, La Temp&ecirc;te,
whom in the time of the Great Chevalier
I knew well, hath long been aware of my
thirst for knowledge concerning those
herbs and potions which affect the human
body, especially when it hath been
subjected to certain usage in warfare&mdash;savage
warfare in particular, in the
which arrows and tomahawks share with
the more civilized rifle and bayonet in
the destruction of flesh and tissue. Now,
as I have observed on a former occasion,
monsieur, there is an intimate connection,
little understood, nevertheless, between
the science of medicine, which includes
the art of surgery, and the science
of dancing, which includes the art of
manners. To both of these a knowledge
of the complicated human frame is indispensable.
Therefore, as I have said,
the great medicine-woman of the Chickasaws,&mdash;who

<!-- page 277 -->

hath gone back to her people,&mdash;acquainted
with my desire to advance
myself in all that tends to enhance
the value of my two professions, dispatched
the negro Achille for me, that
I might in person study your wounds,
which, believe me. Monsieur de Valdeterre,
were of a nature most remarkable."</p>

<p>The speaker drew a long breath and
started afresh, pressing the finger-tips
of his two hands together to emphasize
his words.</p>

<p>"I have added largely to my knowledge
of herbs and potions, monsieur.
For example, to wit: the balsam of the
copal-tree hath a virtue past belief for
the healing of dangerous wounds; as also
hath the green leaves of the China radix;
and the root known as the choctaw. For
the pains which torment the head, the
pounded leaves of the ground-ivy; for
the fevers which set the blood aboil, an
infusion of the <i>plat de bois</i>."</p>

<!-- page 278 -->

<p>Mounted thus on his favorite hobby
the good soul galloped gayly away. De
Valdeterre ceased to listen, though his
eyes were fixed with a look of profound
attention on the speaker.</p>

<p>"And the Little Chevalier? Was <i>he</i>
here for me, or for&mdash;the other?"</p>

<p>The words did not pass his lips, though
he was fain to set his teeth together to
keep them from leaping forth. Neither
did he then or after ask news of Mademoiselle
de la Roche. Something undefined
but patent in the manner of his
companion forbade this, even had he himself
wished to speak of that false and
cruel enchantress, as most assuredly he
did not!</p>

<p>He walked to and fro in the leafy covert
where he had lain for more than three
weeks, leaning at first on the arm of the
Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;; but within a day or two,
gaining strength from moment to moment,
he explored the whole of Oy&emacr;-chi-chi-ta

<!-- page 279 -->

except the extreme upper end,
which was cut off from the main body of
the island by a deep dry gully. The tall
pines, which grew in scattered groups
over the high sandy strip of land, were
surrounded and interspersed by an extraordinary
number and variety of trees
and shrubs: ash, magnolia, oak, sweetgum,
opoponax, china, bay, yupon, candleberry,
sassafras, and many others, unknown
and unnamed. Ferns, heart-leaves,
and wood mosses spread with the lush
grass their green carpetry on the ground;
a profusion of wild flowers brightened
the dark recesses of the thickets; birds
of bright plumage and insects on glittering
wings gave a touch of life to the
small paradise set between two arms of
the mighty river; otherwise, except for
the sough of the wind in the pines,
strangely still. The far-off shores on
either side seemed deserted, from the
purple-misted mornings when they slept

<!-- page 280 -->

like dream-shores under the eastern and
western horizons, to the golden evenings
when they melted into the soft clouds
above them.</p>

<p>For a brief space de Valdeterre thought
in his inmost soul that he would be
content to dwell, as he had jestingly said,
forever in Oy&emacr;-chi-chi-ta, hearing nothing,
knowing nothing of the world&mdash;or of
Diane.</p>

<p>But as the days drew on, and full vigor
came rioting back through his veins,
with it came a quickening desire for
change&mdash;activity, association, strife, if
need be. Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute; phlegmatically prepared
by night their food, from the stores
in the cache behind the great pine; by
day he treated his fellow sojourner, or
prisoner, to long disquisitions, which, it
must be confessed, fell on more and
more unheeding ears. The greatest good
fellowship prevailed between the two
isolated men. On de Valdeterre's part

<!-- page 281 -->

the feeling went indeed far beyond good
fellowship, or even gratitude; he admitted
to himself an almost absurd liking for
the whimsical, homely, kindly creature
shut up with him in Oy&emacr;-chi-chi-ta. Nevertheless
he fretted.</p>

<p>"Not yet, mon capitaine," was the invariable
reply of Monsieur B&eacute;b&eacute; to his
daily question, "When do we&mdash;when
may I&mdash;leave the island?"</p>

<p>And when he asked, "Why do we&mdash;why
must I lie here like a thing truly
but half alive, when I have the strength
of an ox, and the desire of a man?"
the sieur simply bade him await in
patience tokens from La Temp&ecirc;te that
the river was not beset with spies.</p>

<p>One day he passed over the bramble-hung
gully at the upper end of the island
and entered the thicket of yupon and
bay set like a screen on the farther side;
a step or two beyond this brought him
to an open space encircled by enormous

<!-- page 282 -->

pine-trees, and swarded with grass vividly
emerald in the mellow afternoon
sunshine. He strode forward, singing
very softly the old chanson which he had
learned from the dancing master:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"<i>Plaisir d'amour ne dure qu'un moment,<br/>

Chagrin d'amour dure toute la vie</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>He stopped amazed.</p>

<p>In the centre of the miniature prairie
were two graves, set east and west, with
hewn stakes at the head and foot. One
was old, the grass-grown mound having
that crumbled and sunken appearance
which comes to a grave with the lapse of
months; the other was new, the freshly
heaped-up earth, soft and loose, was
strewn with withered wild flowers; these
lay also on the older grave.</p>

<p>De Valdeterre stood looking wonderingly
down on these mysterious evidences
of death&mdash;and life! At a slight touch
on his shoulder, he turned.</p>

<p>"Here," said Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;,&mdash;for the

<!-- page 283 -->

newcomer was he,&mdash;indicating the older
grave, "here the Chevalier de la Roche
is buried."</p>

<p>De Valdeterre uttered an involuntary
ejaculation. The Chevalier de la Roche!
His father's friend! His father's slayer!
The father of the Little Chevalier! The
father of&mdash;Diane! The Great Chevalier!</p>

<p>He removed his hat and bowed his
head reverently.</p>

<p>"And here," continued Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute; in
a tone of deep melancholy,&mdash;"here
sleeps the young chief, Chivonah."</p>

<p>"Chivonah!" echoed the captain, trembling
with an emotion he could not
define.</p>

<p>"He was wounded in the midnight
fight which followed that in which you
yourself were laid low, monsieur&mdash;perhaps
by his tomahawk; God knows. He
was brought hither a few hours after
you; and the great medicine-woman of
the Chickasaws, who tended you, tended

<!-- page 284 -->

him also. But for him her skill was
naught; the brave young spirit went
forth from Oy&emacr;-chi-chi-ta to the Land of
Beyond. La Temp&ecirc;te sang the death-song,
one midnight, over her son&mdash;"</p>

<p>A sob arose unbidden into de Valdeterre's
throat. That death-song! That
mother-song! He had heard it, wild and
weirdly mournful, riding the still midnight
silence!</p>

<p>"I helped her bury him by the side
of his father, the Great Chevalier; and
La Temp&ecirc;te departed to her own people,"
concluded B&eacute;b&eacute; with a catch in his
voice.</p>

<p>The two men walked away in silence.
De Valdeterre, glancing furtively at his
companion, saw that his eyes had a far-away
look, and that the furrows in the
long face were wet with unchecked tears.
The thoughts of the sieur had indeed
traveled backward; he was once more
in the forest with the Great Chevalier

<!-- page 285 -->

and Achille, the faithful slave, and the
fawn-like girl, Olala, who stole out from
the wigwam of her father to follow the
white chief whither he would; . . . and
then, Olala and her soft-eyed babe, Chivonah; . . .
again, the Great Chevalier
in a hostile wilderness, and himself, and
Achille, and the girl Olala, become the
woman La Temp&ecirc;te, and Chivonah, the
supple, leaping boy; . . . and yet again
the Great Chevalier and La Temp&ecirc;te, the
medicine-woman, and the young chief
Chivonah, with his wild heart divided
for and against the white chief, his father.
The ceaseless combats, the weary
marches, the murderous assaults, savage
yells, blood, torture, treachery&mdash;all these
had faded from his mind; there stood
out against a background of wood and
brake only the figures of the Great Chevalier,
and Olala, the fawn-like girl, and
Chivonah, the young chief; and Machengo,
called Achille, the son of a king!

<!-- page 286 -->

"Mo venin aussi, ma&icirc;tre," he murmured,
as if he, too, saw a beckoning hand.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>At sunset the Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute; received by
the hands of an Indian lad the token of
La Temp&ecirc;te in assurance that the passage
to the city could be made in safety;
and before midnight he stepped with de
Valdeterre into a pirogue and paddled
noiselessly and swiftly out from a sheltered
cove of Oy&emacr;-chi-chi-ta to the mid
current of the great downward-sweeping
river.</p>

<hr/>

<p>XXI</p>

<p class="small">LE VEAU QUI T&Ecirc;TE</p>

</div>

<p>IT was little more than a month since
he had marched with the Company of
Bachelors through the Porte St. Louis
and up the Tchoupitoulas Road, yet it
seemed to de Valdeterre, when he stepped
from the pirogue upon the levee over
against the Place d'Armes, that he had
been away for years. The familiar scene
in the early morning light&mdash;the flotilla
of barges, sloops, canoes, and pirogues
dancing on the river, or moored to the
shore; the brigs and brigantines lying at
ease with their high poops abreast of the
levee; the throng of voyageurs, Indians,
sailors, habitans, 'M&eacute;ricains, chaffing
each other in a multitude of tongues&mdash;all
these once well-known sights and

<!-- page 288 -->

sounds had become strange to his eyes
and ears. He looked about with half-dazed
senses, as he followed Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;
along the levee and across the willow-fringed
neutral ground to the square.
Hard upon the open gate of the square
the dancing master stopped abruptly and
faced his late comrade in exile.</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Vicomte will have the
goodness to understand," he began in a
stiff and formal tone, "that from this
moment he becomes once more my enemy,
since he is enemy to the House of La
Roche, which I have the honor to serve.
Monsieur will, however, do me the favor
to remember that, robust as he now is,
it behooves him to be careful until the
wound which remains open shall be entirely
healed. I have the honor to salute
the Vicomte de Valdeterre, and to bid
him adieu." He did salute after the
most stately fashion, though there were
undoubtedly tears in his honest eyes;

<!-- page 289 -->

and rejecting the vicomte's proffered
hand, he stalked rapidly away, turning
by the Church St. Louis into Rue
Cond&eacute;.</p>

<p>De Valdeterre smiled as he pursued
his own way, but there was pain at the
root of his smile. "Why," he asked himself&mdash;"why
did I hurry so foolishly away
from Oy&emacr;-chi-chi-ta? There, at least, I
had a friend. Now"&mdash;a deep sigh ended
the reflection.</p>

<p>He met as he crossed the Place several
men he knew slightly&mdash;it was too early
for many of the noblesse to be abroad.
They greeted him as one unexpectedly
returned from the dead.</p>

<p>At the entrance of The Sucking Calf,
he came upon Gailliard, who embraced
him with lively expressions of surprise
and genuine tears of joy; he dragged
his new-found friend away from the voluble
delight of Jean Marie, and the silent,
motherly rapture of M&egrave;re Jacqueline,

<!-- page 290 -->

into that upper chamber where they
two had so often sat at meals together.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Henri, sit down, my fine
resurrected corpse of a captain, and tell
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will talk only to the tune of a knife
and fork," interrupted de Valdeterre,
laughing. "It is more weeks than I can
count, Gailliard, since I have eaten a
civilized meal; though, God forgive me
for complaining!" He crossed himself
piously.</p>

<p>"Raguet!" shouted Gailliard, running
to the door. "Breakfast, Raguet, immediately!
Where the devil is that devil
of a Jean Marie?"</p>

<p>But Jean Marie had waited for no
charge; they presently seated themselves
before a table which offered an almost
ludicrous contrast to the Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;'s
wooden platters and hunting-knives,
jerked venison and cold coffee.</p>

<p>"After all, my appetite was keener in

<!-- page 291 -->

Oy&emacr;-chi-chi-ta," thought de Valdeterre,
suddenly indifferent to M&egrave;re Jacqueline's
cuisine.</p>

<p>Gailliard, it appeared, had not been
without hope of his comrade in all these
weeks; faint rumors had reached him,&mdash;he
hardly knew whence or from whom&mdash;which
had in a measure reassured him as
to the captain's safety. But, mon Dieu!
the waiting had been long and anxious.</p>

<p>He listened open-mouthed to the story
of Henri's timely abduction by the free
man of color, Achille; and of his fight
for life in the Island of the Half-Living;
of the marvelous healing touch of the
medicine-woman of the Chickasaws, and
of the skill and gentleness of Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;&mdash;the
speaker told all that had befallen
him, except his absurd vision of the
Little Chevalier.</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" commented Gailliard
when he had finished. "As for the Sieur
B&eacute;b&eacute;, he shall be carried on the shoulders

<!-- page 292 -->

of his old pupils to Government House,
and receive a medal of honor from the
marquis himself."</p>

<p>"And now, Gailliard," resumed the
vicomte, "the news! the news! You
do not seem to realize, my dear fellow,
that I have been out of the world&mdash;one
of the Half-Living&mdash;for the matter of
a century or so!"</p>

<p>"Take a long breath, Henri," returned
the royal engineer, "for here is a coil of
news that will make your head swim, I
promise you. First and foremost, the
Marquis de Vaudreuil hath been promoted,
or reduced, according as the matter
is viewed from one or the other face,
to the governor-generalship of Canada.
His successor, as we are told, is de
Kelerec."

<p>"Ah!" said the vicomte. "It had
been softly whispered about before I left
that my kinswoman, the Marquise de
Vaudreuil, hath for this long time had

<!-- page 293 -->

a hankering toward the older glories of
Quebec."</p>

<p>"Well, 'tis settled. Many of the governor's
officers go with him."</p>

<p>"The late under-secretary, for example?"
inquired de Valdeterre, with uplifted
eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;to be sure, you cannot have
heard! Delaup is disgraced. According
to the royal statute regarding the opening
of letters and the breaking of seals,
he hath been openly proclaimed, fined one
hundred livres, and forever debarred
from holding any office under the crown.
Had he been a habitan, instead of a nobleman,
he had worn the <i>carcan</i>."<sup>1</sup></p>

<p class="small">[<sup>1</sup>An iron collar.]</p>

<p>"But," cried de Valdeterre, astonished,
"how did the knowledge of his crime
come to the governor's ears?"</p>

<p>"Not by me, Henri, though I swear to
you, I longed to cry him aloud, the treacherous
viper! That morning when he came

<!-- page 294 -->

palavering into the council-room with the
marquis, you remember? The man was
unmasked to his excellency after we
marched, by some one less scrupulous,
evidently, than yourself."</p>

<p>"But how&mdash;how?"</p>

<p>"I know not the exact details. But at
least I know that the thing was tracked
by means of certain documents addressed
to yourself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To me!"</p>

<p>"To the Vicomte de Valdeterre,
yes. These were: a royal order, a duplicate,
as I understand, of one already
in your possession, authorizing you to
take possession of all properties acquired
in Louisiana by the late Chevalier de la
Roche&mdash;"</p>

<p>De Valdeterre sprang to his feet,
wholly unable to contain himself, while
he listened to all Gailliard could tell him
of the affair.</p>

<p>"I know not neither how nor when

<!-- page 295 -->

these papers came into the hands of the
beautiful Diane," continued Gailliard,
"but as a consequence, Delaup, as I have
said, is disgraced. He hath disappeared,
Heaven send it be forever! and Mademoiselle
de la Roche hath abandoned the
ch&acirc;teau and all its belongings, including
the negro slaves there, and taken refuge,
with the favorite of Louis the Fourteenth,
in the Convent of the Ursulines."</p>

<p>"Good God!" ejaculated de Valdeterre;
"how she must hate me!"</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Gailliard innocently.
"It is a lucky thing for you, Henri, that
you also hate her! She declares, I am
told, that her House shall never touch a
sou of her father's fortune, which is now
yours, should she and all her people
starve. However," he added, as de
Valdeterre opened his lips angrily to
speak, "she will but profit in the end by
the stir made about the affair de Valdeterre
<i>vs</i>. de la Roche. For the marquis,

<!-- page 296 -->

writing some months ago to beseech the
king for the return of Madame de Ste.
Hermine to France, spake in so glowing
terms, it seems, of the Great Chevalier's
daughter, that his majesty hath not only
recalled Madame de Ste. Hermine to
France, but sends graciously for mademoiselle.
'Tis said that he hath declared
his royal intention of bestowing her hand
in marriage upon one of his favorite
courtiers."</p>

<p>"And the Little Chevalier, her brother?"
demanded de Valdeterre after a
pause.</p>

<p>"The Little Chevalier goes with her,"
returned Gailliard, looking fixedly at him.</p>

<p>"I shall not myself touch a sou of the
la Roche fortune," declared de Valdeterre
emphatically, and with heightened color,&mdash;"not
a sou." He walked back and forth
with angry strides.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," Gailliard remonstrated,
"if Mademoiselle de la Roche

<!-- page 297 -->

refuses to retain the plantations, houses,
slaves, and jewels de la Roche, and you
decline to lay a hand upon them, there
will be a fat plum to fall into Madame de
Pompadour's ever-open mouth, that is all!
I am sure, by the way, that our royal
master had no idea of the extent of these
possessions when he so generously bestowed
them upon you!"</p>

<p>De Valdeterre was not listening. He
had paused in his walk and stood lost in
bitter reflections. Rousing himself with
a shake of the shoulders, he repeated:
"No, not a sou, Gailliard. Let the plum
fall where it will. For myself, I shall follow
the governor to Canada. And you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I?" Gailliard blushed like a
schoolboy, and fidgeted in his chair.
"No, I shall stay. Perhaps under the
new governor I may yet have a chance
of building my canals. Besides," he added
boldly, "I am going to wed Mademoiselle
Alys d'Hauterive."</p>

<!-- page 298 -->

De Valdeterre bounded to his side and
seized his hand. "My dear Gailliard, I
wish you joy. Mademoiselle d'Hauterive
is the most charming young woman in
the Province!" he cried heartily.</p>

<p>"And to think," mused Gailliard, shaking
his head, "that I once imagined
myself enamoured of la belle Diane&mdash;capricious,
haughty, cruel, implacable
Diane! You are lucky, Henri, I repeat it,
that you are the enemy and not one of
the lovers of Mademoiselle de la Roche!"</p>

<p>XXII</p>

<p class="small">THE PLAISANCE</p>

</div>

<p>DE VALDETERRE crossed the
courtyard well-nigh roofed over
by the giant grapevine, now a
spreading glory of green, and ascended
the stair. On the threshold of his door
he paused, struck painfully by the abandoned
and desolate air of the once well-ordered
place. "My poor Chapron," he
murmured, the tears starting to his eyes,
"my poor old Chapron! Faithfully indeed
hast thou kept thy vow, made to thy
mistress, my mother&mdash;more faithfully
than thy master has kept his, sworn to
the dead!"</p>

<p>He laid his hat on the dusty table, but
started back; in the dim noon-light filtering
in through the closed shutters, he

<!-- page 300 -->

perceived the white square of a folded
paper on a pile of books. He picked it
up, recognizing its source even before he
had touched it; underneath it lay a large
key.</p>

<p>"From the Little Chevalier," he
breathed, his heart beating with quickened
throb. He broke the seal. "To the
Vicomte de Valdeterre." The small, firm
handwriting filled but a small part of the
large sheet.</p>

<br/>

<p><i>To the Vicomte de Valdeterre:&mdash;</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Vicomte</span>,&mdash;The famous garden
which was mine is now yours. I send
you the key of the gate in the wall, and
I trust that you will allow me once more
to play the host in that garden, and to
entertain you <i>&agrave; l'outrance</i>&mdash;according to
our agreement. Our meeting shall take
place, if it please you, at five and a half
of the clock, this afternoon, the 7th of
June. Until that hour, I remain, my dear

<!-- page 301 -->

vicomte, impatient, and with profound
respect,</p>

<p class="right">Yours sincerely,<br/>

<span class="smcap">Valcour de la Roche</span>.</p>

<br/>

<p>"Insensate madcap of a boy!" cried
de Valdeterre angrily; "as if&mdash;But I
will not fight with any de la Roche alive.
I am weary of the feud. Let him call me
coward if he will. I shall leave my sword
behind me. If the saucy varlet run me
through the lungs, why then, so much
the better, perhaps.</p>

<p>"Pardon, my father!" He unlocked a
cabinet and took out the miniature. "Pardon,
Nadan de Valdeterre!" He looked
long and earnestly at the bright face.
"In Paradise, where thou art&mdash;and he!
thou hast long ago forgiven the friend of
thy youth. Pardon me, if I also forgive!"</p>

<p>He closed the case and thrust it into
his bosom.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<!-- page 302 -->

<p>He closed the gate in the wall and
locked it behind him. Within the great
inclosure he stood a moment, as once
before, and looked about him. Nothing
had changed, save that the foliage on the
wide-limbed trees was denser and had
taken on a more vivid green. Through
downward-sweeping branches he could
see in the distance the red roofs, gables,
and dormer-windows of the ch&acirc;teau. A
mass of greenery hid the quaint clinging
balconies, and the wide galleries. The
kitchen-garden with its graceful hedges,
the grove of orange-trees, the banana-walk&mdash;these
he surveyed with half-seeing
eyes. Finally, he turned into the
path by the ditch, which was now criss-crossed
with blackberry and dewberry
vines, and bordered with tall flowering
weeds.</p>

<p>The day was waning, but the warm
sunlight shimmered mist-like over the
plaisance; a westering breeze brought to

<!-- page 303 -->

his nostrils, as he walked on, the familiar
scent of roses and jessamines, and
the pungent odor of the yucca-bells. He
shut his inner and outer senses to the
sweet and bitter memories which assailed
him, and hurried on, between fantastic
shapes of arbor vit&aelig; and pettisphorum,
past the huntress gleaming white on
her pedestal, past the mirror-like pool,
over which hovered a cloud of yellow
butterflies, on by the mildewed sun-dial.
When he stepped out upon the open
sward, he stopped and stood, motionless,
waiting, waiting&mdash;it seemed an eternity!&mdash;for
Valcour de la Roche.</p>

<p>Just as before, the cloaked and plumed
figure of the Little Chevalier swaggered
out of the turreted summer-house, and
moved swiftly toward him over the rank
grass. He removed his hat as the lad
paused before him, and bent low his bared
head.</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Vicomte de Valdeterre"&mdash;the

<!-- page 304 -->

full, rich, well-remembered voice
seemed a trifle unsteady. "Monsieur le
Vicomte de Valdeterre," repeated the
Little Chevalier, his tone becoming bolder,
"will you do me the honor to draw your
sword?"</p>

<p>De Valdeterre remained silent, with
downcast eyes and compressed lips.</p>

<p>"What, monsieur! have you forgotten
the problem that waits to be solved?
or, are you afraid of the result?"</p>

<p>The mocking voice stung the listener
almost beyond endurance. But with head
still bowed, he replied calmly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Chevalier de la Roche, I
refuse to cross swords with you. Think
of me what you will."</p>

<p>"Then," cried the Little Chevalier, his
words leaping sharply into the tranquil
air&mdash;"then make your devoirs to God&mdash;and
to your Lady&mdash;"</p>

<p>The defiance ended curiously in a sob.
De Valdeterre trembled from head to

<!-- page 305 -->

foot, hearing it. He lifted his eyes slowly.
The long cloak, off-cast, lay on the
ground; the plumed hat and the rapier
beside it. Diane, in her soft white clinging
gown, the sunlight tangled in the
strands of the red-gold hair, her eyes
shining with unshed tears&mdash;Diane stood
confessed before him; she held out beseeching
hands.</p>

<p>"Diane!" he stammered, recoiling
with amazement and alarm; then, the
truth dawning slowly upon him, "Diane!"
he cried again rapturously, clasping
her to his breast.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>"How could you have been so stupidly
blind. Monsieur de Valdeterre?" demanded
Mademoiselle de la Roche, seated
beside him once more on the bench at the
feet of the marble Diana. "Never a
woman in the whole world, no, not even
that dullest of women, Alys d'Hauterive,
could have been so deceived!"</p>

<!-- page 306 -->

<p>Love, he reminded her, was always
blind.</p>

<p>But not to his own, she smiled.</p>

<p>Her brother, she told him, Valcour
Mery de la Roche, three years her senior,
had died soon after their arrival in Louisiana.
His name had been added to her
own by their stricken father, who from
that moment had with his own hand
trained her in all those exercises&mdash;hunting,
fencing, shooting, riding, swimming,
in which he himself so excelled. Except
in his Indian campaigns, she had companioned
him as the other Valcour would
have done had he lived. And so, to the
Great Chevalier's intimates, and particularly
to the Marquis de Vaudreuil, his
fast friend, his daughter had come to be
known as the Little Chevalier.</p>

<p>"And much ado I had," she laughed,
nestling to her lover's side, "to keep
Gailliard and the others from betraying
me by addressing me by that sobriquet!

<!-- page 307 -->

It took an official order from the governor,
though neither he nor they knew
my reasons therefor, to send the Little
Chevalier into exile, and relegate his
name even to oblivion."</p>

<p>"Blessed Little Chevalier!" cried de
Valdeterre.</p>

<p>"Do you know I am half jealous of
him!" pouted Diane. "For up yonder in
Oy&emacr;-chi-chi-ta, when you had scourged
me, Diane, out of your heart&mdash;nay, monsieur,
you said it yourself in your delirium!&mdash;you
spoke tenderly of the Little
Chevalier."</p>

<p>"Blessed Little Chevalier!" repeated
Henri, kissing the small white hands he
held.</p>

<p>"You told me, Henri, here in this very
garden of&mdash;yours&mdash;that you loved me
the first time that ever your eyes fell
upon me, there by the corner of the
Church St. Louis, the night of the F&ecirc;te
des Rois. But I&mdash;I loved you before

<!-- page 308 -->

that. Ah, how handsome you were that
day, Henri, with your sword in your
hand, and your head so proudly erect!
And oh, how terrified I was when I
thought I had killed you! and Sieur
B&eacute;b&eacute; and Achille came running at my
cries, and carried you into the ch&acirc;teau
and laid you on my father's bed."</p>

<p>"Dear Little Chevalier!" He waited
a moment to get the better of the swelling
in his throat. "So! My dream was
true, Diane. You did come to me in Oy&emacr;-chi-chi-ta!
You did dress my wounds,
and lay your soft cool hand on my forehead!"</p>

<p>Yes. She had set out at once with
Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;&mdash;in spite of Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;, in
spite of Madame de Ste. Hermine, in spite
of the Mother Superior; her departure
unknown to any one else&mdash;for the Island
of the Half-Living, upon hearing the
news brought by Achille, poor Achille!
It was she indeed and none other who

<!-- page 309 -->

had sent the negro after the troops,
charging him to watch over the captain
of the Bachelors.</p>

<p>"Even after you had&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Even after I had behaved so outrageously
to you? Yes, Henri. Strange,
was it not," she added musingly, "that
even before I knew it myself, my poor
major-domo divined that I loved you?"</p>

<p>So, that was why! De Valdeterre
blushed at his own past conceit, and at
Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;'s indulgence of it.</p>

<p>"And you came back to the city?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"In the care of La Temp&ecirc;te herself
when you were declared out of danger."</p>

<p>After another contented pause&mdash;
"Then you knew me&mdash;of course you
knew me!&mdash;that night at the Palace,"
he exclaimed suddenly. "How could
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, but it was not all acting, Henri!"

<!-- page 310 -->

she interrupted eagerly. "I thought, I
hoped that&mdash;that you would have forgiven&mdash;everything
after, after&mdash;" her
eyes swam with tears; he kissed them
away.</p>

<p>"After I had looked once into your
lovely eyes? God forgive me for the brute
I was. But, listen!" he cried, pouring
out all the story of the pain and humiliation
of that unforgotten night.</p>

<p>"But, Diane," he continued, "you?
When Delaup came to you with that
wretched order,"&mdash;for she had made
him acquainted with the under-secretary's
trickery,&mdash;"why could you not trust me&mdash;so
far, at least, as to give me an opportunity
to vindicate myself?"</p>

<p>"It was not the order of his majesty,"
confessed Diane, dropping her eyelids
and coloring violently.</p>

<p>"Then, what was it?" he insisted.</p>

<p>For reply, she took from the bosom of
her gown the royal order; and then the

<!-- page 311 -->

letter purloined by Delaup, addressed to
the Vicomte de Valdeterre, at New Orleans,
in the care of the governor. She
spread the letter out upon her knee, and
traced each line with a white forefinger
for him to read.</p>

<p>"My dear Henri: I send you by
request of his majesty's private secretary"&mdash;de
Valdeterre followed the sense
with lukewarm interest, his gaze fascinated
by the small, exquisitely shaped
finger which moved back and forth across
the page. "Since from your late letters
I understand"&mdash;she turned the page&mdash;"that
you are on the point of asking in
marriage the hand of Mademoiselle Alys
d'Hauterive, of whom, indeed, you seem
much enamoured&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This was the reason. Monsieur de
Valdeterre!" cried Diane, crumpling the
letter in her hand and flashing upon him
a fiery glance. "What did I care for his
majesty's order!" She threw up her

<!-- page 312 -->

head superbly. "Take the Great Chevalier's
property, monsieur, and welcome,
all of it!" She was whipping herself
into a fine fury. "But this letter&mdash;you
will explain at once, monsieur, the meaning
of this letter!"</p>

<p>"Diane!" Explanation was rendered
unnecessary by the tender reproach in
his voice. "Besides," he said, "Mademoiselle
d'Hauterive is going to marry Gailliard.
By the way," he added energetically,
"Gailliard tells me that you are
going to France with Madame de Ste.
Hermine."</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"And that the king will bestow the
hand of la belle Diane upon one of his
own favorites."</p>

<p>"True," she returned demurely. "I
have signified my entire acquiescence in
his majesty's plans&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Diane!"</p>

<p>"&mdash;Since the said favorite is none

<!-- page 313 -->

other than Henri Louis Nadan, Vicomte
de Valdeterre."</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>"Henri," Diane said presently, "I have
one more confession to make. It is a
terrible one. But I make it on the part
of the Little Chevalier, for whose crime
I demand absolution."</p>

<p>"Speak on, my Little Chevalier."</p>

<p>"Henri, I&mdash;no, I mean Valcour de la
Roche kissed you on the forehead when
you were lying unconscious on his father's
bed at the ch&acirc;teau, after your duel with
him."</p>

<p>"Oh&eacute;, mon Petit Chevalier! Let us
fight a duel every day!"</p>

<p>"And also several times at Oy&emacr;-chi-chi-ta."</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Chevalier de la Roche,
I will hang a tomahawk by way of thanks
in the shrine of St. Louis, my patron saint,
as soon as we reach Paris."</p>

<p>The zozo moquer had begun to sing.</p>

<p>"Diane," remarked de Valdeterre, "we
will be married at once. When a man
has been betrothed for more than eighteen
years, it is unfair to ask him to wait
longer."</p>

<p>She looked at him in astonishment.
In his turn he smoothed a written page
upon his knee and traced with his fingers
for her to read the faded lines of
the contract of betrothal between Henri
de Valdeterre and Diane de la Roche.

<p>The marriage was celebrated a few
weeks later in the Church St. Louis
which faces the Place d'Armes. It was
a great event; the extraordinary beauty
of the bride, the fine and manly bearing
of the handsome bridegroom, their strange
story with its romantic ending, and the
unusual favors bestowed by the governor
in the king's name upon the young
couple&mdash;all combined to enhance interest
in the affair. A splendid reception at

the Palace followed the religious ceremony,
where the Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute; in all the
glory of lace and ribbon directed the
<i>contre-danse</i> composed by him for the
occasion; and the marquis drank a toast
to Monsieur and Madame de Valdeterre;
and Gailliard in an immortal speech proposed
the health of the Little Chevalier.</p>

<p>Monsieur and Madame de Valdeterre
remained a few months only in the
Province; but during these months they
drew about them in the Ch&acirc;teau de la
Roche all that was gayest and most gallant
in the town by the river.</p>

<p>In Paris, whither they went when the
great marquis quitted forever his beloved
Little Versailles for his new post of duty,
they became at once a part of the brilliant
life of that joyous capital; Madame
de Valdeterre continuing to the day of
her death to be known as la belle
Diane.</p>

<p>The Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute; wept when his adored
mistress went away. But he could not
bring himself to leave the land which
enshrined the dust of the Great Chevalier.
He fell in a skirmish with the
Chickasaws a few months after Diane's
departure, fighting gallantly, and pierced
by many wounds.<sup>1</sup> Some unknown person,
La Temp&ecirc;te herself probably, conveyed
his body to Oy&emacr;-chi-chi-ta, and
laid it to rest beside the Great Chevalier
and Chivonah, the young chief of the
Chickasaws.</p>

<p class="small">[<sup>1</sup>Sieur B&eacute;b&eacute;, the eccentric military dancing
master of the Province, was in reality killed in an
encounter with the Indians in 1748.]</p>

<p>No trace of the Ch&acirc;teau de la Roche
remains in the town by the river; the
street called Good Children (Rue des Bons
Enfants) runs across the place where the
red-roofed house once stood; and near
the spot where the plaisance of the beautiful
Diane de la Roche lay bathed in

sunshine, rises the quaint old Church of
St. Augustine. The cr&ecirc;pe myrtles and
the sweet olives which blossom thereabout
may perhaps be far-away descendants
of those that made sweet the air
for the young lovers who listened to the
song of the zozo moquer.</p>
