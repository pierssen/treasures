<h2>UNDER THE MAN-FIG.</h2>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>PROLOGUE.</p>

<p class="small">THE TOWN AND THE RIVER.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> name of the River is <i>Los Brazos de
Dios</i>, which is to say, The Arms of God.</p>

<p>The bed of it is very deep; and the color
of the water&mdash;when it creeps sluggishly
along between its banks, so shallow in places
that the blue heron may wade it without
wetting his knees&mdash;is the color of tarnished
brass. But when it comes roaring down from
the far-away Redlands, a solid foam-crested
wall, leaping upward a foot a minute, and
spreading death and destruction into the outlying
lowlands, then it is as red as spilled
blood.</p>

<p>On its banks, more than a century and a
half ago, a handful of barefoot Franciscan
friars, who had prayed and fought their way
across the country from Mexico, founded
the Presidio of St. Jago, and corralled within

<!-- page 2 -->

the boundary walls a flock of <i>Yndios reducidos</i>.</p>

<p>There were the stately church, cloistered
and towered and rose-windowed,&mdash;a curious
flower of architecture abloom in the savage
wilderness,&mdash;and the block-house with its
narrow loopholes, and the hut into which
the Indian women were thrust at night under
lock and key.</p>

<p>The mighty forest and open prairies around
teemed with Yndios bravos, who hated the
burly, cassocked, fighting monks, and their
own Christianized tribesmen.</p>

<p>These came, in number like the leaves of
the live-oak, to hurl themselves against the
Presidio. And, after many days of hard
fighting, the single friar who remained alive
turned his eyes away from the demolished
church, and, under cover of smoke from the
burning block-house, led the remnant of
Yndios reducidos (who because they had
learned to pray had not forgotten how to
fight) out of the inclosure by a little postern-gate,
and down the steep bank to the
yellow thread of the River below.</p>

<p>Midway of the stream&mdash;thridding the
ankle-deep water&mdash;they were, before the red
devils above discovered their flight. The

<!-- page 3 -->

demoniac yell from a thousand throats pushed
them like a battering-ram up the opposite
bank, whence, looking back, they saw the
bed of the River Tockonhono swarming
with their foes. Then the Yndios reducidos
opened their lips and began to chant the
death-song of the Nainis; and the friar,
lifting his hand, commended their souls
and his own to the God who gives and who
takes away.</p>

<p>But, lo, a miracle.</p>

<p>Even as the waves of the Red Sea&mdash;opened
by the rod of Moses for the passage
of his people&mdash;closed upon Pharaoh and his
host, so, with the hoarse roar of a wild beast
springing upon his prey, the foam-crested
wall of water fell upon the Yndios bravos,
and not a warrior of them all came forth
from the river-bed but as a bruised and
beaten corpse.</p>

<p>So the friar, falling on his knees, gave
thanks. And the River, which was the
Tockonhono, became from that day Los
Brazos de Dios, which is to say, The Arms
of God.</p>

<p>Such is the legend of the River.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>The town is on the River. It was built

<!-- page 4 -->

there nearly a hundred years after the forgotten
Presidio of St. Jago.</p>

<p>It was reckoned once a centre of luxury
and refinement. But that was during the
epoch of the short-lived republic, and before
the time of June Badgett.</p>

<p>It has changed but little, however, since
the days when June and his cronies foregathered,
gossiping, under the Man-Fig.</p>

<p>The gray weather-beaten old stores fronting
the River drowse in the mellow sunshine
like contented old folks who could, if they
would, wake up and babble of past glories
with the best.</p>

<p>The shadows of the great live-oaks lie
athwart the by-streets, and above them rise
the roofs of the same many-galleried aristocratic
old mansions that shelter later generations
of the same aristocratic old families.</p>

<p>The ferryman&mdash;it is always a Hopson,
the office is hereditary&mdash;still shuffles down
the bank after he has been called a dozen or
so times, and pulls the shackly ferry-boat
across the river. You can hear the pulley
creaking its way along the rope half-way to
the railroad station, which is at the edge of
a cotton-patch on the other side of the river.
The train, as in the year of our Lord eighteen

<!-- page 5 -->

hundred and fifty-seven (when the story
begins), lumbers in and out at uncertain
hours. If you are intending to leave, and
should be delayed, it will wait for you a
reasonable length of time,&mdash;say three quarters
of an hour; though, unless you are acquainted
with its vagaries, you may be
startled into undue haste by the wild shrieks
with which the locomotive beguiles its tarrying.</p>

<p>The warehouse has not sloughed a shingle
from its roof in all these years, nor lost a
brick of its sturdy old walls.</p>

<p>The boats sailing the River&mdash;which goes
Gulf-ward, now hesitating and reluctant, now
thundering down in headlong haste, whipping
its red waves into spume&mdash;may be new,
but they look, with their black hulls and
patched sails, like the boats which sailed the
River forty years ago.</p>

<p>The townsmen still sit about under the
store-sheds,&mdash;standing up, hat in hand, every
mother's son of 'em, when a woman, young
or old, homely or beautiful, chances to pass,&mdash;comfortably
minding each other's business,
and free, neighbor to neighbor, of
pocket as of tongue.</p>

<p>Girls, slim and supple in their white

<!-- page 6 -->

gowns, flit of summer afternoons through
the purpling shadows; and the sound of
their voices is like the cooing of young pigeons.</p>

<p>In short, the old town&mdash;the lovablest,
old-timiest, easy-goingest old town that ever
was&mdash;sits there by the River, hugging its
traditions, and hoarding its stories, of which
it has enough to make a new Thousand and
One Nights.</p>

<p><i>Under the Man-Fig</i> is one of these.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="small">THE COURT IN SESSION.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Van Herrin</span>'! Well, I reckon! I'd
know his hide ef I saw it in a tan-yard!"</p>

<p>The speaker&mdash;a short thick-set man, with
a broad face, red bristly beard and small
twinkling eyes&mdash;slapped his hand against
his thigh, and looked somewhat defiantly
around upon his auditors.</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't mean to doubt ye, June,"
said one of these in an aggressively skeptical
tone, "but ef it was night-time"&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was betwix' nine an' ten o'clock at
night," interrupted the first speaker, with
emphasis. "I'd been down to Sam Billups's
after a load o' watermelons, an' I was
a-drivin' kinder slow (my team bein' blowed),
an' jis' as I got to the turn o' the road beyan
Roseneath, I saw a man step out on the
side-gall'ry, through one of them long winders.
He stood a minit ag'ins' the light"&mdash;</p>

<p>"You couldn't o' reco'nized nobody's
face on Miss Thornham's side-gall'ry fum

<!-- page 8 -->

that turn o' the road, June Badgett," put in
his opponent doggedly.</p>

<p>"Hold your jaw, Rufe Drennon," replied
the man Badgett. "Gentlemen," he continued,
turning his back on the doubter and
addressing the others, "I saw a man come
out'n one of them long winders an' stan' a
minit on the side-gall'ry. Then he jumped
down an' come acrost Miss Elinor's rose-garden;
an' as I drove past, he opened the
gate an' come out. The moon was as bright
as day. I don't b'lieve he saw me at all.
He was lookin' straight ahead of him, an'
his eyes bugged out like a fire-beetle's. But
I saw <i>him</i> plain enough. He went down
the road todes his own house. An' I wish
my Maker may strike me stone dead ef that
man wa'n't Van Herrin'!"</p>

<p>"You've been a-tellin' o' that tale studdy
fer the las' three weeks," said Drennon, after
a short pause, during which they all ruminated
silently on the threadbare but still exciting
story. " 'N ef you're so dead shore that
Van Heerin' took 'em, why'n't you"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I ain't shore," interrupted Badgett again,
thrusting his hands into his pockets and settling
back against the fence. "All I know
is, I saw Van Herrin' with my own eyes,

<!-- page 9 -->

come out'n Miss Thornham's side-gate three
weeks ago to-night."</p>

<p>The men who composed the small group
were lounging in the shade of an enormous
fig-tree, whose gnarled and knobby branches
overhung one corner of an abandoned door-yard.
This landmark&mdash;older, some said,
than the town of Thornham itself&mdash;was
known as the Man-Fig. It had long ceased
to bear the luscious fruit which the oldest
inhabitant&mdash;June Badgett's father&mdash;remembered
to have gathered, surreptitiously,
when a boy. But it continued to thrive in a
scraggy sort of way, leaning over the fence,&mdash;which
served at once as a hitching-place
for horses and a support for the backs of
the village idlers,&mdash;and sending its sprawly
roots out in every direction. The origin of
its name was unknown. A dim legend survived
of the murdered Spaniard whose blood
had watered its infant roots, and passed into
its great reddish-purple fruit. But this half-forgotten
story was only recalled by the inquiry
of some curious stranger, the familiar
appellation making no impression upon accustomed
ears. During the short winter,
which brought a bleak look to the spot, nipping
the banana leaves and scorching the

<!-- page 10 -->

cann&aelig; that grew in uncultivated profusion
about the deserted house in the inclosure,
the open space beneath the Man-Fig was
left to stray cows, or to the colts whose
whinnying dams were tethered to the rotting
fence. But all through the semi-tropical
spring and the long hot summer, its scant
shade sheltered the male contingent of the
Thornham gossips. They stood about, leaning
against the fence, or squatted on the
ground, gravely discussing all manner of
questions&mdash;from the President's last message
to the ear-marks of their own hogs.
More than one political campaign had been
planned under the Man-Fig; and, truth to
tell, more than one reputation laid on the
rack.</p>

<p>The stillness which succeeded June Badgett's
last remark was broken by the shrill
whistle of a locomotive. There was a perfunctory movement under the Man-Fig.
Dud Welsh stood up and looked across the
river at the crowd running toward the little
station, and at the ferryman descending, on
the hither side, the deep cut in the bank, to
where the ferry-boat was fastened.</p>

<p>"I might sell some o' them watermelons
over at the <i>dee</i>-po'," remarked Badgett tentatively,

<!-- page 11 -->

lifting a lazy elbow toward his
wagon, which stood a few yards away, its
deep bed loaded with green, glistening, round-bellied
melons, "but it's too durned hot. I
ain't goin' acrost."</p>

<p>A sigh of relief passed through the squad.
The wide street which ran along the river-bank
lay hot and dusty in the quivering
noontide heat. The stores and offices facing
it were apparently deserted; though from
time to time, when a plantation team crawled
in and stopped, a shirt-sleeved clerk came
languidly out to take an order; or a booted
and spurred horseman, jingling up, passed
the time of day with the invisible proprietor
dozing on his chair within. At Addington's
warehouse, hunched against the bluff above
the ferry, there were signs of life. A heavy
bolt fell with a clang, the wooden doors
swung open, a man appeared on the threshold,
gesticulating, and shouting orders into
space, and a dozen stalwart half-naked negroes
swarmed suddenly down the bank and
leaped upon the ferry-boat as it drew away
from the shore.</p>

<p>"I reckon Jack Addington's lookin' fer
some freight," said Tuke Chancellor, gazing
after them. "Well, boys, it's too late to

<!-- page 12 -->

git over now. Anyhow, 'tain't wuth the
trouble. She's gittin' plum rickety."</p>

<p>The houses composing the town of Thornham&mdash;buried
in vines and shrubbery, and
shaded by mighty and magnificent live-oaks&mdash;followed
in single file the curves of the
river,&mdash;now low and sullen-looking between
its high banks. The town in general had
an old and worn-out look, though not a half-century
had gone by since the underbrush
was cleared from its site, and barely a quarter since Steven Thornham built the first
brick house&mdash;a stately mansion a stone's-throw
or so from the Man-Fig&mdash;and turned
his attention to ousting Mexican authority
from the vast region of country then beginning
to be known as Texas. But it had
had its day in the mean time, the placid little
town! Epauleted officers had lounged
along its muddy sidewalks; couriers had
galloped in and out with sealed dispatches;
Santa Anna, a prisoner of war, had strutted
its single street. There, the first constitutional
government had been inaugurated;
and the president of the young republic
had there taken his oath of office. The
after-glow of that gay and courtly time still
lingered about the aristocratic town houses

<!-- page 13 -->

and the luxurious plantation homes that
lined the downward-sweeping river on either
side to within sound of the beating Gulf-surge.
Later stories there were, too, of
silent craft that had crept stealthily up
the stream to discharge human freight,
akin in color to the midnight shadows
that hung about the stoop-shouldered warehouse,
and slipped as stealthily back into
the Gulf and thence toward the coast of
Guinea.</p>

<p>Then came the puff of the first locomotive-engine. The wonder of this had not
yet died away. "She" was due once a day,
and&mdash;sometimes several moments earlier,
oftener an hour or more later, than the
schedule time&mdash;the train came snorting
noisily in, jolting and jostling the infrequent
passengers. The station, separated
from Thornham proper by the river, presented
at such times a busy and animated
appearance. Rarely indeed did man or boy,&mdash;though
the spectacle entailed a hurried
rush to the ferry and a run up the steep
bank on the opposite side,&mdash;rarely did a
Thornhamer miss the sight of the incoming
or outgoing of the lumbering engine, and
its single dingy comfortless coach.</p>

<!-- page 14 -->

<p>"I wonder ef she's fetched any passengers,"
said Jimmy Hopson, the youngest of
the Man-Fig conclave, secretly longing, yet
ashamed to bolt away at the last moment to
see "her" uncoupled and side-tracked for
the night.</p>

<p>"Who is that with Pete Newall?" demanded
Badgett abruptly, peering out from
under the brim of his straw hat.</p>

<p>A light buggy drawn by a gaunt gray
horse came up the river-bank from the
ferry and glanced by, throwing the dust in
their faces as it passed. It was driven by
a large clean-shaven man with keen gray
eyes and a kindly mouth; his somewhat
careless dress was in accord with the unkempt
look of the vehicle and harness, and
the rough coat of the raw-boned but swift
horse. His companion&mdash;a man near his
own age, thirty-five years or thereabout&mdash;offered
a striking contrast in manner and appearance.
His dark neat traveling-suit was
faultless in cut and fit. He sat erect, with
his gloved hands resting upon his knees.
Everything about his slender and elegant
person bespoke a high-bred and somewhat
haughty repose. His blue eyes were hard
and cold; a drooping mustache concealed

<!-- page 15 -->

his mouth, but not the firm, somewhat projecting
chin. He seemed to ignore the presence
of his escort, and he looked neither to
right nor left as they whirled along the
dusty highway.</p>

<p>"I b'lieve in my soul it's Johnny Thornham!"
exclaimed Badgett, jumping to his
feet and staring after the buggy. "I ain't
seen him sence he left here nigh twenty
years ago. But he's got the same biggaty
look he was born with; and&mdash;yes! they've
turned into Miss Elinor's big gate."</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>"Will you come first to my office? or
shall I drive you to the hotel, Jo&mdash;Mr.
Thornham?" Newall asked with his foot
on the step of the buggy. He had to repeat
his question as he seated himself beside
the newcomer and picked up the reins; for
the engine was shrieking and backing amid
the delighted clamor of the crowd about the
platform.</p>

<p>"Neither, thank you, Mr. Newall," replied
his guest courteously; "I will go at
once to Roseneath, if you please."</p>

<p>Hardly a word further was exchanged between
the two men until they turned in at
the large iron gate at Roseneath and drove

<!-- page 16 -->

slowly around the circular oak-shaded carriage-way
to the house.</p>

<p>"The grounds seem much smaller than I
remember them," Thornham said, turning
upon the broad gallery and looking about
him with something like a contemptuous
sneer.</p>

<p>"It is a fine old place," retorted his companion
a little hotly; then, as if ashamed of
his haste, he added quietly, "Miss Thornham
was very fond of it."</p>

<p>"So was my mother." The stranger said
this almost under his breath, following the
lawyer down the wide hall and into the large
old-fashioned parlor.</p>

<p>Here Newall seated himself by an open
window, turning his head with innate delicacy
while Thornham walked about the well-remembered
room, pausing now and then
to touch, with a restless finger, a yellowed
book, or a dust-covered ornament. The
sunlight streaming in through the windows
fell full upon the two portraits over the
mantel. He glanced for a second at the
stern pictured face of his father; his own
face hardened into a likeness of it, and a
bitter smile curved his thin lips. But his
eyes softened as he turned to the other portrait.

<!-- page 17 -->

He rested his arm on the mantel and
gazed long and musingly upon it.</p>

<p>It seemed but yesterday! The cold, selfish,
rich, prosperous man of the world felt
himself trembling once more under the harsh
denunciatory sentence of that Steven Thornham,
of whom it was said that he broke, or
bent, everything that came to his hand; he
felt again, warm upon his forehead, his
mother's tears.</p>

<p>"Let us come to business, Mr. Newall," he
said brusquely, straightening himself and
passing his gloved hand across his eyes.</p>

<p>He led the way himself, and as if instinctively,
into a small room which opened
upon a side-gallery. It overlooked the
rose-garden, and had been his mother's
morning-room. It was absolutely unchanged
in all these years! There was the
low chintz-covered lounge with its high-piled
pillows; the claw-footed table; the
spider-legged secretary; the brass-bound
work-stand with the silver sewing-bird
perched upon its edge,&mdash;even the familiar
little dog-eared Thomas-à-Kempis, open and
face downward on the embroidered hassock!</p>

<p>A large Newfoundland dog lying on a
rug alongside the couch looked up with a

<!-- page 18 -->

questioning growl as they entered, then
arose and walked over to where Thornham
stood, and laid a shaggy head against his
knee. He shrugged his shoulders as if
shaking off an importunate sentiment, and
seated himself, motioning the lawyer to a
chair.</p>

<p>"You will tell me the particulars of my
sister's death," he began, giving an impatient
push to the dog, which nevertheless
continued to nestle affectionately against
him. "You will remember, as I have already
written you, that I have heard next
to nothing of her since my mother died, ten
years ago. In fact," he added, "I can
scarcely realize her at all. She was, you
know, some years younger than I; and I
was, myself, little more than a boy when
I went away."</p>

<p>"Yes," assented the lawyer, "I know.
Well, after your father's death, your
mother"&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is not necessary to speak of my
mother," interrupted Thornham coldly.
"Confine yourself, if you please, to my
sister Elinor and her affairs."</p>

<p>"Just after your&mdash;her&mdash;mother died,"
continued Newall, stammering a little, but

<!-- page 19 -->

recovering himself, "Miss Elinor fell into
delicate health."</p>

<p>"There had been some sort of love-affair,
had there not?" asked his listener, apparently
without much interest, for his eyes
were wandering abstractedly about his
mother's sitting-room.</p>

<p>"Yes,"&mdash;the lawyer flushed a little,&mdash;"there
had been a love-affair. Miss Elinor
that is Miss Thornham&mdash;was engaged
for a couple of years to her second cousin,
Vanborough Herring. Do you remember
him?"</p>

<p>"No," returned Thornham listlessly. "I
never saw him. He came to Thornham
after I left. So he was the man. What
became of him?"</p>

<p>"The engagement was broken off&mdash;no
one ever knew why&mdash;just after your&mdash;after
Mrs. Thornham died. Herring went away&mdash;to
Kentucky, I think; and a year later
he came back, bringing a wife with him."</p>

<p>Thornham looked up as if suddenly
aroused. A dark red spot showed for a
second on either cheek, and his eyes flashed.
But he did not speak.</p>

<p>"He has continued to live here in Thornham.
He belongs to the poorer branch of

<!-- page 20 -->

the Vanborough-Thornhams. He has a
large family. He is a lawyer; hardworking
enough, but he has never seemed to
make any headway. She&mdash;she was very
fond of him."</p>

<p>Newall uttered these sentences in a jerky
sort of way, singularly different from the
professional tone he had hitherto used.
Thornham looked at him a moment in
silence; then, as if dismissing Vanborough
Herring from the conversation, he inquired:
"Was my sister's illness a long
one?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and no," Newall returned. "During
the ten years that she lived here alone
after your&mdash;for ten years she was subject,
at intervals, to sudden and painful attacks,&mdash;some
trouble with the heart, I believe;
and in one of these paroxysms she finally
died. But much of the time she was well;
and though leading a quiet and almost secluded
life, she took a vivid interest in
everything that went on here in Thornham,
as well as in the outside world. Hers was
a most lovely character. She was very
beautiful. And so young to die! She was
barely thirty, you know."</p>

<p>There was a tremor in his voice which did

<!-- page 21 -->

not escape his hearer, and his own tone was
less hard when he spoke, after a short
pause:&mdash;</p>

<p>"She must have been very like my
mother! Who was with her when she
died?"</p>

<p>"No one. She died, in this room, on
yonder couch, three weeks ago to-night,&mdash;alone.
Not neglected, oh, no!"&mdash;seeing
the wrathful frown on the face before
him,&mdash;"not uncared for! She had been
slightly ailing for some days, and unable to
take her accustomed drive. She seemed
depressed, too, and unusually restless. She
came to this room&mdash;she was, in fact,
carried, in the arms of one of her servants,
as I understand&mdash;late that afternoon; and
here Doctor Alsbury saw her soon after
nightfall. She was weak and nervous, but
quite free of pain. Mrs. Hopson&mdash;you remember
Aunt Patty Hopson? She was
your mo&mdash;Mrs. Thornham's housekeeper
before you were born." Thornham nodded.
"Aunt Patty and her maid were with her.
But when the doctor had taken his leave,
she sent them both away, desiring, as she
often did, to be alone. She was lying upon
the lounge, with the small table beside her,

<!-- page 22 -->

the bell within reach of her hand. Mrs.
Hopson went into the dining-room, with the
maid, and remained there, superintending
some household matters. Nearly two hours
passed. The night was warm and still, the
house very quiet. Aunt Patty had just observed
to the maid that Miss Elinor had
probably dropped asleep, when Magnus, the
old Newfoundland there, who was lying at
her feet, got up, as if suddenly aroused, and
came down the hall in this direction. The
girl called to him softly, fearful lest he
should disturb her mistress, but he passed
on, and a moment later they were startled
by a piteous howl which rang through the
silent house. They ran, frightened, into the
room. The dog was leaping distractedly
against the couch, where his mistress was
lying, white and motionless, apparently in
a heavy swoon. The doctor, hastily summoned,
found life extinct. Death had come to
her&mdash;painlessly, he said in one of
those spasms of the heart to which she
was subject. She had been dead perhaps
half an hour."</p>

<p>The speaker's voice died away in something
like a smothered sob. The dog, at
mention of his name, had lifted his great

<!-- page 23 -->

head and fixed his intelligent eyes upon
Thornham's face. He now walked over to
the couch and stood there whining softly.
There was a moment of pained silence.</p>

<p>Thornham half arose, but reseated himself,
arrested by a fleeting expression which
crossed his companion's face.</p>

<p>"There is something more," he said
quietly; "go on."</p>

<p>Newall looked up surprised; he flushed a
little and moved uneasily in his chair.</p>

<p>"Yes," he admitted, dropping his eyes,
"there is something I ought to tell you,
but"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well?" demanded Thornham, as he
hesitated.</p>

<p>The lawyer cleared his throat and proceeded.
"About the time the lamps were
brought in that night, she asked Aunt Patty
to bring her a box from her jewel-case. It
contained, I am told, a diamond necklet of
great beauty and value"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have never heard of it," Thornham
said, answering a look in the speaker's eyes;
"but, then, I know nothing whatever of my
sister's life, or her possessions."</p>

<p>"She held the box in her hand during
the doctor's visit. No one is known to have

<!-- page 24 -->

entered the room afterward; but when the
alarm and excitement over her sudden death
had somewhat subsided, Mrs. Hopson remembered
the box and desired to return it
to the casket. It had disappeared. It was
then noticed that one of the windows&mdash;the
one next you there&mdash;opening upon the side-gallery,
which was closed when Aunt Patty
and the maid left the room&mdash;was standing
open. There were heavy footprints in the
rose-bed beneath the gallery, and leading
off into the rose-garden, showing that some
one had jumped down and passed across to
the gate."</p>

<p>"Who is suspected?" demanded Thornham,
with keen interest.</p>

<p>The lawyer's voice dropped to a shamed
whisper. "No one is known to have entered
the house, but Herring was seen coming out
of this window about three quarters of an
hour after Mrs. Hopson quitted the room."

<p>"A Vanborough! Impossible!" cried
Thornham angrily.</p>

<p>A look of relief came into Newall's eyes.</p>

<p>"I felt bound to mention this circumstance,"
he said, "but I myself believe Vanborough
Herring incapable of"&mdash;</p>

<p>Thornham was not listening. He got up

<!-- page 25 -->

and made two or three turns about the small
room, the dog following at his heels.</p>

<p>"Investigate it," he said sharply at length,
pausing before his companion. "Investigate
it," he repeated, interrupting a hurried
protest. "If a Vanborough can rob a dead
woman, by God! and a woman he has jilted,
he ought to suffer for it! Look into it at
once and prosecute if necessary; spare no
expense." He brought his fist down on the
small table as he spoke. The tray of glasses
there quivered, filling the room with their
crystalline tinkle.</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," said Newall briefly.</p>

<p>They passed into the hall. "That rattle-trap
of a train leaves, I believe, at ten
o'clock to-morrow morning?" Thornham
asked.</p>

<p>"You surely do not think of returning
so soon," said the lawyer astonished. "I
thought"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have important business elsewhere,"
interrupted Thornham again. "Or, rather,"
he continued, with a short unmusical laugh,&mdash;"in
God's name, what have I to do with
the town of Thornham or its people! I
wish my mother's portrait forwarded as soon
as possible to my address in New Orleans.

<!-- page 26 -->

And my sister's," he added as an afterthought.
"I will advise you as to what
disposition to make of the family belongings
and my sister's private property. As
to the house and grounds, sell at once.
I have no sentiment about the place. I
sometimes wish I had kept Fair View, the
plantation down the river, where my mother
used to go with me during my vacation days.
But I sold that when it came into my possession
after my father's death. Yes, sell
Roseneath&mdash;at once, if possible."</p>

<p>"And the negroes&mdash;the house-servants?
There are a good many of them. Elinor"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sell them! At once! I have no use
for such property. Sell it all; horses&mdash;I
suppose my sister kept horses?"</p>

<p>"As fine a pair as ever trotted in harness,"
replied Newall, visibly nettled.</p>

<p>"Very well. Sell them all. Sell everything."
He tossed a defiant glance at his
father's portrait, for they were standing
again in the parlor. "I leave the whole business
in your hands. You will communicate
at need with my lawyers in New Orleans.
And now, have the goodness to drive me to
a hotel. I am a little tired after my long
journey."</p>

<!-- page 27 -->

<p>The Newfoundland shambled down the
steps behind him; and, after he was seated
in the buggy, reared up to place a huge
paw upon his knee.</p>

<p>They talked&mdash;spasmodically&mdash;of indifferent
subjects as they drove back through
the town, Newall secretly wondering at his
companion's utter want of curiosity or interest
concerning his birthplace and the people among
whom his boyhood had passed.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are married, Mr. Newall?"
The question sounded perfunctory.</p>

"No, I'm not married," returned Newall
curtly, as the buggy stopped before The
President's Rest tavern,&mdash;so called because
Sam Houston had slept there the night preceding
his inauguration.</p>

<p>The afternoon shadows had lengthened,
and a breeze blew up salt from the Gulf.
The town was slowly awaking from its prolonged
nap. Old Mr. Lusk, standing in his
store door, was holding an animated conversation
with Uncle Billy Duncan, in his
spider-wheeled gig. Ned Cushington had
come out of the "Gazette" office with a
paper moist and smelling of printers' ink
in his hand, and was reading a bit of late
news to some men on a corner; his fine dark

<!-- page 28 -->

eyes were flashing with excitement. Women
and girls, in groups of twos and threes, in
light summer gowns, flitted about the grassy
by-ways. A stentorian chorus arose from
Addington's warehouse, where the negroes
were piling freight.</p>

<p>The loafers under the Man-Fig commented
idly upon the actors in this familiar
panorama.</p>

<p>"I wish my Maker may strike me stone
dead ef it ain't Johnny Thornham shore
enough!" declared Badgett, breaking in
upon Tuke Chancellor's description of one
of Major Billy Duncan's tantrums; "an'
as <i>vi</i>-grous as old Steve his-se'f!"</p>

<p>"Then it's high time for Van Herrin' to
light out," suggested Welsh.</p>

<p>"Shucks!" said Drennon, standing up
and stretching his long arms above his head
with a grunt, "he neenter be skeered. No
Thornham ain't goin' to prosecute no other
Thornham."</p>

<p>"Bet you that load o' watermelons 'g'ins'
a cob-pipe!" cried Badgett.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>"Unearth that d&mdash;d hound of a Vanborough,
Mr. Newall," Thornham reiterated,
the next morning, drawing on his gloves,

<!-- page 29 -->

after glancing over and signing the few necessary
papers drawn up the night before by
the lawyer. He stepped out of the dingy
and disordered little office after a formal
adieu, politely declining Newall's offer to
drive him to the station. He walked briskly
along the shaded side street, for the lawyer's
office was set well back from the river in the
rear of the business portion of the town.
He did not so much as turn his head in
the direction of the old Thornham mansion,
whose steep roof and red-brick chimneys
showed above the live-oaks away to the
right. His busy thoughts had already leaped
forward to his city life: his elegant bachelor
apartments, his club, the opera, the races,
the never-ending round of amusement and
distraction which had become so necessary to
his well-being. That his vast wealth was
augmented by a small fortune was hardly
compensation for the physical discomfort
and the troublesome sentiment of the past
twenty-four hours. In three or four days,
at the farthest&mdash;</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly. Something warm
and soft, like a rose-leaf, had touched his
wrist. He looked down. A child&mdash;a little
girl of seven or eight years&mdash;had put out

<!-- page 30 -->

a hand to arrest him; with the other she
tugged at the latch of a large wooden gate
which abutted upon the uneven plank sidewalk.</p>

<p>"I can't get in by myself," she said,
looking gravely up at him. "Maum Betty
couldn't come with me. Please open it."</p>

<p>He glanced beyond her at the house which
stood at the further end of a prim shelled
walk, and he laughed aloud at the memories
evoked by the sight of its porches
and gables; then he dropped his eyes again
upon the child, and his laugh softened to a
smile. The little maid, tall, perhaps, for
her years, had that look, delicate but not
unhealthy, common to growing children.
Her small, rather plain, oval face, with its soft
outlines, was lighted by a pair of large dark
eyes, whose serious expression seemed at
variance with the pretty laughing mouth.
The mass of reddish-brown hair which fell
over her shoulders was trained, after the
fashion of the time, into long loose ringlets.
A certain daintiness about her person
and manner bespoke gentle blood and tender
care.</p>

<p>"What is your name, little one?" Thornham
asked, with his hand on the latch.</p>

<!-- page 31 -->

<p>"Olive Vanborough Herring," she answered
promptly, with a proud uplifting of
her firm little chin.</p>

<p>"Are you the daughter of Mr. Vanborough
Herring?"</p>

<p>She nodded her head with great satisfaction.
"Yes, sir. Olive Vanborough Herring,"
she repeated.</p>

<p>He pushed open the heavy gate, stooping
a little as he did so. He had not dreamed
of offering to kiss the child. But she put
up her mouth frankly. A curious thrill
passed through him as he felt upon his own
the warm touch of her red lips.</p>

<p>She ran gayly along the flower-set walk
toward the house. He swung the gate to its
place, frowning. The engine over at the
station was already puffing and shrieking.
From where he stood he could see people
hastening toward the ferry, and he heard the
hurry and bustle about the warehouse, where
some belated barrels were being rolled down
the bank. He shook his head impatiently,
muttered something under his breath, then
turned and walked rapidly back toward the
lawyer's office.</p>

<p>Newall still sat in the worn leather chair
where his client had left him. His head

<!-- page 32 -->

had fallen forward on his breast, his usually
jovial face was downcast, his eyes weary and
troubled. "Poor Van!" he sighed. "She
loved him to the last&mdash;that I know. It
will be necessary for him to go away, at
least until the matter blows over. For"&mdash;
He sprang to his feet as a shadow darkened
the door. "What is it, Mr. Thornham?"
he asked confusedly. "Have you forgotten
anything? Can I"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I cannot wait, Newall," interrupted
Thornham. "I have only come back to say
that I have decided not to have that robbery
investigated. There is not sufficient proof
to my mind. It certainly is not a matter of
importance to any one except myself. Vanborough
Herring is not to be disturbed. See
to it, please."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Johnny!" cried Newall in-voluntarily.
"Elinor loved"&mdash;</p>

<p>He turned aside, blushing crimson. Thornham,
almost equally embarrassed, picked up
a fishing-rod which was lying upon a heap
of legal documents on the table, and pretended
to examine it.</p>

<p>"So you still fish, Pete?" he said gayly,
after an imperceptible pause. "Do you
remember the day we upset your father's

<!-- page 33 -->

boat in the river, and how near you came to
drowning because you wouldn't let go the
string of catfish tied to the oar-lock?"</p>

<p>The parting hand-shake this time was
warm and cordial, and Thornham hurried
away to catch his train. "<i>Olive Vanborough!</i>"
he murmured, as he passed the
gate where he had met the clear-eyed child.
It had been the maiden name of his mother&mdash;that
idolized mother from whose arms he
had been driven by a father's curse&mdash;the
only human being he had ever loved&mdash;the
sole living creature, he told himself passionately,
that had ever cared whether he himself
lived or died!</p>

<p>A succession of shrieks from the distant
locomotive caused him to quicken his steps.
An anxious frown lowered upon his brow.
"Am I to be left another night in this
beastly hole," he growled aloud.</p>

<p>"Neb-min', Mars Johnny," said a voice
at his elbow. "Don't you be skeered.
She's gwine to wait ontell you git aboard
her. She ain' in no sech hurry ez she's
mekin' out."</p>

<p>Thornham turned, and stared blankly at
the speaker.</p>

<p>"Lawd, Mars Johnny, you ain' fergot

<!-- page 34 -->

Lib!" the negro went on, catching the light
traveling-bag from his hand and falling a
pace or two behind him as he moved on.</p>

<p>"Why, Liberty!" he cried, shaking his
old playfellow heartily by the hand. "Is
this you?" His blue eyes lighted with
genuine pleasure. "What have you been
doing all these years, you rascal? Digging
bait? and stealing <i>red-injun</i> peaches? and
riding the horses to water, eh?"</p>

<p>Liberty, a gigantic, well-made, neatly-dressed
<i>griffe</i>, a year or two younger than
his master, drew himself up. "No, sah,"
he replied proudly. "I has been Miss
Elinor's butler for a matter o' ten year,
sah."</p>

<p>"Miss Elinor's butler, eh?" said Thornham,
amused.</p>

<p>"Yes, sah. When ole Mis' died, Miss
Elinor she took me from de stable an' fotch
me inter de house. An' I been her butler
ever sence."</p>

<p>"What did you do?" demanded his
companion, still smiling.</p>

<p>"I mos'ly took keer o' Miss Elinor, sah.
You see, Mars Johnny, Miss Elinor wa'n't
overly strong a'ter ole Mis' died; an' she
useter say nobody could'n tote her up an'

<!-- page 35 -->

down stairs like Liberty. Lawd, she wa'n't
nothin' to <i>tote</i>, Miss Elinor wa'n't! Light
ez a baby! No mo' 'n de same day she died,
I fotch her into yo' ma's settin'-room an'
laid her on de longe. An' when she look'
up at me wi' dem big eyes o' hern, stidder
speakin', Mars Johnny, I know'd"&mdash;</p>

<p>He shook his head, unable to go on. The
tears streamed unheeded down his cheeks.</p>

<p>"Liberty," said his master abruptly,
"you know everything is going to be sold,
and Roseneath broken up?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sah," said Liberty anxiously. "I
was born on de place, Mars Johnny," he
added, in a wistful tone.</p>

<p>"I know," Thornham went on; "so was
I. But I shall sell it. How would you
like to come to New Orleans with me?"</p>

<p>The anxiety on the negro's face deepened.
An appealing look came into his big doglike
eyes.</p>

<p>"Very well," continued his master, without
disappointment. "Then you'd rather I
gave you your freedom?"</p>

<p>"Mars Johnny," Liberty said, edging up
to him and speaking in a confidential tone,
"don't you do no sech foolishness ez dat.
I ain' made fer no free-nigger. I has lived

<!-- page 36 -->

all my life 'long o' white folks, an' I ain'
fitten to live 'long o' free-niggers. Lawd,
Mars Johnny, I run away once in ole Mars's
lifetime; an' I stayed down yander in de
Brazos bottom 'long o' some yether runaway
niggers 'bout fo' days. An' 'fo' Gawd,
Mars Johnny, I was glad when I was cotch,
an' fotch in! But what is de mos' consequenche
is Betty. Betty is my ole 'ooman.
An' Betty ain' got no use fer free-niggers!"
He laughed softly.</p>

<p>"Who owns your wife?"</p>

<p>"Mars Van Herrin', sah; Betty's a lakly
gal. Spry on her foot ez a sparrer. No,
Mars Johnny, thanky all de same. I don't
want no freedom 'dout Betty. An' Betty
would'n leave her white folks not ef she
was set free ter-morrer."</p>

<p>"Well, Lib," said his master carelessly,
setting foot on the ferry-boat which had
answered the negro's sonorous call, "if you
do not wish to come with me, and are not
willing to be set free, I suppose you will
have to go on the block."</p>

<p>"I reckin so, Mars Johnny," Liberty returned
dejectedly. "Gawd sen' dey don't
sell me fur away fum Betty."</p>

<p>The boat slipped across the yellow stream,

<!-- page 37 -->

the wooden pulley creaking as it moved
along the heavy rope. They walked up the
farther bank in silence. The train was apparently awaiting the belated passenger, for
at sight of him the brakeman ran along the platform and called out cheerfully, "All
right, Cap, here he comes;" and the conductor,
appearing at the rear of the coach,
waved his hand in friendly greeting.</p>

<p>Liberty stood beneath the window, chatting
with his master until the train started.</p>

<p>"By the way," said Thornham, thrusting
his hand into his pocket, "there is an old
dog at Roseneath&mdash;a Newfoundland"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Magnus, sah! Miss Elinor's ole dog.
He's been in ou' fam'ly a long time, Magnus
has."</p>

<p>"Well, I want you to take care of that
dog as long as he lives. Take him away
with you when you leave Roseneath." He
dropped a roll of money into the negro's
hand. "Good-by, Liberty."</p>

<p>"All right, Mars Johnny. Thanky,
Mars Johnny, thanky. Good-by, Mars
Johnny."</p>

<p>He gazed absently after the train as it
labored away. "Gawd sen' I ain' sold fur
away fum Betty!" he muttered.</p>

<p>II.</p>

<p class="small">THE JOLIBOIS DANCING-ACADEMY.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Anatole de Jolibois</span> and her
maiden sister, Miss Serena Dibbs, were the
joint owners of the odd-looking, many-porched,
weather-beaten house into which
little Olive Herring had disappeared under
the abstracted gaze of John Thornham.
Here they lived, alone, the only surviving
members of a hard-working respectable family,
whose head&mdash;a master-carpenter with
ideas&mdash;had built the house with his own
hands in the palmy presidential days of
Thornham. It rambled about the large
space allotted to it in a fashion of its, or
rather of Mr. Dibbs's own, bulging here and
there into unexpected and wholly irrelevant
bows, and swells, and octagons, and bristling
at every angle with little windowless turrets
which served no apparent purpose. The hall
which divided it in half was&mdash;relatively&mdash;baronial
in size, and had been a sore vexation
to the late Mrs. Dibbs by reason of the

<!-- page 39 -->

bare floors and the daily waxing and polishing
thereof then in vogue.</p>

<p>This housewifely duty, however, after their
mother's death, had been less vigorously
exacted of themselves by the doubly orphaned
Dibbs sisters&mdash;until the inception
of the Dancing-Academy.</p>

<p>Madame Anatole de Jolibois, or Miss
Kizzy, as she was familiarly and affectionately
called by the townspeople,&mdash;a tall,
angular, heavy-jawed woman, with curiously
deep-set, dark soft eyes and a bossy nose,&mdash;was
the elder of the two sisters. As Miss
Dibbs some years earlier, she had possessed,
beside a half-interest in the Dibbs homestead,
a tidy sum in bank. To this she
added from time to time continued savings
from her slender salary as assistant music-teacher
at the Thornham Female Seminary,
where her younger sister was in process of
being "finished."</p>

<p>Miss Keziah, despite her angularity, her
plebeian birth, her nose, and her deplorable
want of taste in matters of dress, had attracted
the attention of Monsieur Anatole
de Jolibois, Professor of Music and The
French Language at the Seminary; and
after a brief but ardent courtship, this elegant

<!-- page 40 -->

and dapper person, some years her
junior, had actually led her to the altar&mdash;as
she herself expressed it. Thornham held up
its hands in amazement over this extraordinary
proceeding; but it fell into spasms
of retrospective prophecy when, in less than
a week after the wedding ceremony, Monsieur
de Jolibois disappeared without the
formality of a leave-taking, carrying with
him the whole of Miss Kizzy's hard-earned
and carefully hoarded money, withdrawn
from the bank by herself the day before, and
affectionately confided to the better judgment
of her newly made spouse.</p>

<p>The faculty of Thornham Female Seminary,
which with flattering haste had elevated
Madame de Jolibois to a "full professorship"
in the college, dismissed with equal
promptitude the abandoned bride from all
connection with that institution, as a person
unfit longer to initiate its high-bred pupils
into the mysteries of the scales.</p>

<p>For a short time thereafter, her gaunt
figure was seen passing about the winding
walks of her garden; or lingering on one
of Mr. Dibbs's Grecian porticoes, as if expectant
of her lord's return. The few old
friends who ventured to offer sympathy

<!-- page 41 -->

were received with a quiet dignity, and a
grace quite new to a Dibbs; but born, presumably,
of an overwhelming sense of her
disgrace.</p>

<p>One morning, quite as suddenly as the
graceless Frenchman himself had vanished,
Madame de Jolibois also disappeared. Miss
Serena, even then showing symptoms of the
extraordinary obesity which in later years
won for her the sobriquet of Miss "Fatty"
Dibbs, remained alone in the house, red-eyed
and forlorn, but reticent. This, too, was
most unusual for a Dibbs! It excited comment.
In fact, the Dibbs family, small as it
was, occupied, during the whole of that lazy
monotonous summer, more of the attention
of Thornham than it had done since Jed
Dibbs, alone and unaided, had planned and
reared his turreted mansion.</p>

<p>"Spiteful old thing!" cried the fluttering
Seminary girls, when they learned of Miss
Kizzy's departure. "She is <i>pursuing</i> that
dear, handsome, <i>unhappy</i> Monsieur Anatole!"</p>

<p>"Jollyboys is catching it, shore," chuckled
the gossips under the Man-Fig; "an' serves
him right, durn him. Why'n't he stay in
Asia&mdash;or whatever island he come from."</p>

<!-- page 42 -->

<p>"Poor Miss Kizzy!" sighed the older
women. "She has no doubt crept off somewhere
to hide her broken heart. And <i>whatever</i>
will Serena Dibbs do, for a living!"</p>

<p>Exactly six months later, Madame de
Jolibois returned; and a circular, written
in her own fine slanting hand, was carried
by Liberty, Miss Elinor Thornham's colored
butler, from house to house throughout
Thornham.</p>

<p>It announced that Madame Anatole de
Jolibois, having studied the Saltatory Art at
the Celebrated Institution of Madame Z&eacute;mire
Soladelle, in New Orleans, would on
the 15th of October open in the Hall of her
Residence a Dancing-School for Children of
Both Sexes.</p>

<p>Especial attention paid to Deportment.</p>

<p>Hours from 3 to 4 on Tuesdays and Thursdays,
9 to 11 on Saturdays.</p>

<p>Under the Patronage of Miss Elinor
Thornham.</p>

<p>N. B. Music Supplied by Miss Serena
Dibbs.</p>

<p>The last clause explained&mdash;and justified&mdash;Miss
Serena's continued and vigorous
thumping of the <i>Lancers</i>, the <i>Evergreen
Waltz</i>, and the <i>Lydia Schottische</i> on the

<!-- page 43 -->

tinkling old piano during the lonely months
of her sister's absence.</p>

<p>Just why Miss Kizzy had chosen this particular
profession, no one but herself ever
knew. But she carried into it the conscientious
painstaking and scrupulous integrity of
purpose which characterized all her actions;
and though, as June Badgett allowed, it
was a "plum sight" to see her with lifted
skirts and out-turned elbows, setting her
large gaitered feet into the correct First Five
Positions for the edification of her pupils,
or leading them through the mazes of a Virginia
reel, yet her patrons had just cause
for self-congratulation. The little girls, at
least, flocked eagerly to their lessons; and
some contended that an improvement in the
deportment of the very young gentlemen of
Thornham was plainly perceptible.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it presently became apparent
that the reserve of Madame de Jolibois was
not, as had been conjectured, the result of
an acute sense of her position as a deserted
wife, but pride in the importance of her
married estate.</p>

<p>"You must understand Serena," she said
impressively, "that a married woman, and
especially the wife of a d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys, should

<!-- page 44 -->

consider her honorific position, and conduct
herself accordingly. Monshur d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys
indeed may return at any moment, from&mdash;from 
his important Mission Abroad."</p>

<p>And Miss Serena, who believed implicitly
whatever Miss Kizzy believed, held up her
head proudly, and spoke with calm confidence
of Brother Anatole's return.</p>

<p>The Jolibois Dancing-Academy had now
flourished for nearly ten years, and, although
Monsieur de Jolibois gave no sign of repentance
or return, before she died, Miss
Thornham had the satisfaction of knowing
that her old friend and prot&eacute;g&eacute;e had opened
another bank account, and was in a fair way
to be under shelter should a rainy day overtake
her.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>Miss Serena's heart gave a thump, for,
peering through a crack in the door, she
caught sight of a strange man. He had unfastened
the front gate and was standing,
hat in hand, gazing at a little figure which
was running toward the house between the
double row of red hollyhocks and larkspur.
"Brother Anatole has returned," she murmured,
untying her apron hurriedly, and thrusting
her shuck-mop into a corner. But

<!-- page 45 -->

another peep showed her the clear strong
profile of John Thornham as he turned and
walked away in the direction of Newall's
office.</p>

<p>"No," said Miss Kizzy at her elbow.
Her voice was slightly tremulous. "No, I
am not expecting Monshur d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys
<i>to-day</i>. Still, Serena, you should be careful
to lock the front doors when we are waxing
and polishing. It would certainly vex Monshur
Anatole if he should discover his wife
and sister engaged in so menial an occupation.
Why, Olive Herring!" she added,
looking down at the child who had slipped
noiselessly in, "you are full ten minutes
early. Run into the yard, child, and wait
for the others."</p>

<p>Olive obeyed. The sisters&mdash;their skirts
pinned above their knees, and their sleeves
carefully protected by brown-paper bags&mdash;resumed
their interrupted labor, pushing the
mops up and down the dark floor, which
already shone like a mirror, reflecting the
lank spare figure of the one, and the quivering
shapeless mass of the other.</p>

<p>A sudden rush of feet without, and a
shrill chorus of angry young voices, disturbed
the steady swish-swash of their

<!-- page 46 -->

brooms. They disappeared, after a glance
at the clock, into the privacy of their own
apartment, whence half a minute later
Madame de Jolibois emerged, her black silk
skirts shaken down, her sleeves released
from the paper bags, and a red rose (in
memory of the one which Monsieur Anatole
had gallantly fastened there on the day of
their betrothal) adorning her scant gray
locks.</p>

<p>She opened the front door. Her Saturday
morning pupils&mdash;twenty or more in
number&mdash;had swarmed up the steps and
were clustered on the porch, buzzing like so
many angry hornets. In their midst, and
apparently the head and front of the unwonted
disturbance, stood Olive Herring.
Her arms were thrown protectingly about
a bare-headed sobbing girl of her own age.
Her head was lifted defiantly, her lips were
compressed, her dark eyes flashing; she
looked comically like a small Fury. But
Miss Kizzy saw no humor in the situation.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, children?" she
demanded sternly.</p>

<p>For one moment the belligerents were
overawed. Then a clamor of cries and
ejaculations filled the air.</p>

<!-- page 47 -->

<p>"Please 'm, it was Rose Drennon's fault."</p>

<p>"Jed Bates he jerked Rose's hair-ribbin."</p>

<p>"Kitty Wash'n'ton she up 'n' said"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Olive Herring"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dunc Jeffrey he whacked Jed on the

<p>" 'Twa'n't me, Miss Kizzy"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I didn' say nothin' "&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jed he jerked Rose's hair-ribbin, 'n'
Olive she"&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is it all about, Duncan?" interrupted
the dancing-mistress, turning to one
of the older boys,&mdash;a freckle-faced, blue-eyed,
frank-looking lad of fourteen, who
stood somewhat apart, endeavoring to hide
the purple scratch on his cheek with his
straw hat, and furtively brushing the dust
from his jacket.</p>

<p>"I'd&mdash;I'd rather not tell, please'm, Miss
Kizzy," he stammered, flushing scarlet.</p>

<p>"Hit's thess this-a-way, Miss Kizzy,"
piped one of the smaller boys, eager for
distinction. "We uz all out in th' yard,
by th' honeysuckle arbor, waitin' fer Miss
Fatty&mdash;I mean Miss S'rena, please'm to
open the do'; 'n' Rose Drennon she had
on a new hair-ribbin, 'n' Jed Bates he come

'cep'n' <i>me</i> 'n' Dunc 'n' Van, 'n' "&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is scandalous!" cried Madame de
Jolibois, throwing her hands up despairingly.
"Ten years, Serena," she continued,
with impressive slowness, "have I taught
grace and politeness to the young ladies,
and deportment to the young gentlemen of
Thornham, and never before has a ribald
altercation&mdash;a contest&mdash;a combat&mdash;a&mdash;a 
fight, I may say, taken place within these
precincts. If Monshur d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys had
witnessed it, he would have been justly
shocked. I tremble lest he should return at
this moment!"</p>

<p>She drove her flock before her into the
wide hall, and locked the door behind her.
There, standing the delinquents in a row

<!-- page 49 -->

along the polished floor, she administered a
many-syllabled and scathing rebuke, which
many of them&mdash;now middle-aged men and
women&mdash;remember with awe to this day.</p>

<p>A shamefaced apology was tendered by
the whole school&mdash;who repeated it after
Miss Kizzy, like the General Confession&mdash;to
the pretty blonde little girl whose brilliant
green hair-ribbon had been the primary
cause of the disturbance; and the scratched
and battered combatants reluctantly shook
hands.</p>

<p>"I think Duncan Jeffrey is as <i>brave</i> as a
<i>lion</i>," Olive Herring whispered audibly,
though to nobody in particular, as that
young gentleman backed away after this
disagreeable ordeal. Her eyes were fixed
demurely on the toes of her dancing-slippers;
but the boy caught a shy sidelong
glance from beneath the long lashes. And
at that precise moment, the feeling was born
within him which was to grow with his
growth and strengthen with his strength,
even unto his life's end!</p>

<p>Rose Drennon, the motherless child of a
sluggish, uncouth laborer, who "jobbed"
about the gardens and door-yards of Thornham,
dried her eyes, bridling in conscious

<!-- page 50 -->

triumph; and, forgetting her crumpled hair-ribbon,
stood up with one of her late tormentors
for the Lancers.</p>

<p>Miss Serena settled herself upon the
piano-stool, which creaked under her weight,
and spread her pudgy hand over the yellow
keys.</p>

<p>Miss Kizzy unlocked the door, and threw
it open to the honeysuckle-laden air that
came floating in. "<i>Now</i>, if Monshur d<i>ee</i>
Jollyboys should chance to arrive&mdash;by way
of the river, Serena&mdash;for as I have frequently
observed to you, Monshur Anatole
prefers to travel by water&mdash;he will find us
ready to receive him in a becoming manner.
<i>Courtesy to your partners! Swing corners!</i>
Simms Reeves, take your fingers out of your
mouth! Hold up your shoulders, Olive.
<i>Balance all!</i> Not so fast, Serena. <i>Forward
first four! One, two, three!</i>"</p>

<p>And the Jolibois Dancing-Academy fell
suddenly into its accustomed routine.</p>

<p>III.</p>

<p class="small">THE HERRING RIFLES.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> morning, some three weeks later,
June Badgett halted his wagon and team
near the Man-Fig. He was too hurried to
join his cronies there, having, he explained,
contracted with Mis' Alsbury, the doctor's
wife, to fetch her a wagon-load of preserving-peaches
from the other side of the river.
But he plainly had something on his mind,&mdash;something
unpleasant, judging from the
expression on his red face. The suggestion
of a frown appeared between his small nondescript-colored
eyes. He dropped the
reins over one foot and extracted a plug of
tobacco and a buck-knife from his trousers-pocket.
"Johnny Thornham is biggaty to
the plum last," he finally remarked, stuffing
a generous cut of "Nigger-head" into his
mouth.</p>

<p>"Johnny Thornham!" echoed Drennon,
who had slouched forward and stood with an
elbow on a front wheel. "He ain't here!"</p>

<p>"I know he ain't," retorted June, "an'

<!-- page 52 -->

that's the p'ison meanness of it, durn
him!"</p>

<p>"What has he done?" demanded Tuke
Chancellor curiously.</p>

<p>"Done? Well, sir! What do you
s'p'ose is goin' on out yander at Miss Elinor
Thornham's at this durned hot minit? A
private sale, sir. Common folks ain't erlowed
to buy Johnny Thornham's mules an'
niggers, much less'n his ole chairs an' tables
an' sofys!"</p>

<p>"Who says so?" called Jimmy Hopson
from his perch on the broken fence.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> say so, sir! I saw Pete Newall settin'
on a bench in Miss Elinor's rose-garden jes'
now; an' a passel o' men, the Lord knows
who, roun' the back gall'ry, an' I hitched
an' started to go in. Ding ef Pete Newall
didn't have the gall to tell me that it was
a private sale. 'By Mr. John Thornham's
orders, Mr. Badgett,' he says mighty slick,
takin' off his hat. Ole Josh Cameron was
sellin' of the niggers off'n the back steps.
I heerd him a-hollerin' ez I drove away.
Johnny Thornham's orders&mdash;an' he a thousan'
miles off yander in New Or<i>leens!</i>"</p>

<p>"I saw Van Herrin' go in there awhile
ago as I drove by," remarked Welsh.</p>

<!-- page 53 -->

<p>"I thought he had gone off somewhere
out'n reach o' jedgment," Jimmy said, idly
swinging his legs and knocking his heels
against the fence.</p>

<p>"He come back yistiddy on the train. I
seen him over at the <i>dee</i>-po'. He ain't
afeard o' no jedgment. He knows no
Thornham ain't goin' to have the law on
no other Thornham!" and Drennon laughed
triumphantly up in Badgett's face, his dull
eyes gleaming for a second with something
like satisfaction.</p>

<p>"There's somp'n worse'n the jedgment o'
the courts, or o' Johnny Thornham either,"
said Badgett sententiously, "an' that's the
jedgment o' God. You wait tell you see
it strike Van Herrin'. Not that I've got
anything ag'in' Van," he went on in a reflective 
tone, "but I wish my Maker may
strike me stone dead ef I didn't see him
with my own eyes come out'n Miss Elinor's
settin'-room the night she died, an' was
robbed."</p>

<p>"He ain't never said he wa'n't there, ez I
know of," declared Drennon.</p>

<p>"God-a-mighty! I'd like to see the man
that 'ud dare to <i>ast</i> him ef he was there,"
cried Badgett.</p>

<!-- page 54 -->

<p>He gathered up the reins and clucked to
his mules.</p>

<p>"What's your hurry, June?" demanded
Welsh lazily.</p>

<p>"Hurry! Mis' Alsbury has had her
brass kittles on the fire ever sence sun-up
a-waitin'. Gimme the tobacco, Rufe. I
ain't got time to spit, much less'n to set here
an' wait tell you saw off a chaw with that
ole Barlow-knife o' yourn."</p>

<p>Nevertheless he did not go. He looked
anxiously over his shoulder from time to
time, making a feint of examining the split-baskets
piled in the deep wagon-body. The
sleek mules moved their long ears back and
forth and whisked their stumpy tails, aware
that the clucking was only a pretense unless
accompanied by a flick of the rawhide whip.
Drennon slouched back to his place against
the Man-Fig. The conclave remained expectantly
silent.</p>

<p>"<i>Private sale</i>" repeated Badgett to him
self wrathfully. "D&mdash;n Johnny Thornham!
Ez ef his mules an' niggers, an' ole
crock'ry-ware, was too good fer common
folks to look at, much less'n buy."</p>

<p>A black object appeared in the middle of
the road toward Roseneath. It advanced

<!-- page 55 -->

slowly under the broiling sun, raising such
a cloud of dust that even Jimmy Hopson's
keen eyes failed for some time to recognize
the man approaching them. He stood upon
the fence shading his eyes with his hand.</p>

<p>"It's Lib Thornham," he announced at
length, "and Miss Elinor's old dog, Magnus,
gallopin' 'roun' in the dust. Hello,
Lib," he continued, as the negro drew near.
"Have you been on the block?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sah," replied Liberty, touching
but not removing his hat.</p>

<p>"You didn't fetch much, I reckin,"
Jimmy went on facetiously; "not more 'n
a couple o' hundred."</p>

<p>"I fetched nine hundred dollars, cash,"
returned Liberty, with dignity. "I ain'
carpenter, an' bricklayer, an' butler fer
nothin'." His tone, though not insolent,
had that undercurrent of familiarity which
betrays the invariable contempt of the negro
for the "poor-white."</p>

<p>"Who bought you, Lib?" asked Chancellor.</p>

<p>"Mr. Vanborough Herring," replied Liberty,
his thick lips parting in a pleased
laugh which showed his strong white teeth.</p>

<p>"God-a-mighty!" ejaculated Badgett,

<!-- page 56 -->

dropping his lines in his amazement, and
standing up in his seat.</p>

<p>The negro touched his hat again and
walked on, the Newfoundland, with red lolling
tongue and slobbering jaws, trotting
after him.</p>

<p>There was a moment of profound silence.</p>

<p>"Well," said June at last, with an air of
conviction, "well, gentle<i>men</i>, that settles it!
Nine hundred dollars! Van Herrin', to my
certain knowledge, ain't had a law-case fer
more 'n twelve months, ner a pair of new
boots fer six. Nine hundred dollars cash
fer Lib Thornham, an' the Lord knows
what else he ain't bought out yander at
Johnny Thornham's private sale. That
settles it, don't it? He's been off som'ers
an' sold one of them di'mons he stole from
Miss Elinor, that's what he's done."</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>When Liberty reached the pretty vine-clad
cottage where the Vanborough Herrings
lived, he paused in an angle of one of
the squat outside brick chimneys and gave
a low whistle. This brought his wife,
Betty,&mdash;a comely young negress with sleek
black cheeks, a flat nose, and wide smiling
mouth,&mdash;to the kitchen door. She looked

<!-- page 57 -->

about, frowningly, turning a plate in her
shapely hands.</p>

<p>"Is dat you, Lib?" she called in a cautious
tone. "Lawd, I wonder does dat
triflin' nigger think I ain' got nothin' to do
cep',' to stan' in dis do' an' lis'n fer dat
whissle o' his'n!"</p>

<p>She raised her voice, bridling coquettishly.
Then, as Liberty did not appear,
an anxious look came into her great yellow-brown
eyes. "Hit's a bad sign," she muttered
uneasily, "a mon'sus bad sign to hear
a pusson's whissle, an' dat pusson ain' in de
presence. Oh Gawd! what's dat?" She
threw her apron over her head and sank
trembling into a chair, as Magnus, behind
the chimney with Lib, uttered a low whine.
"I know'd it!" she moaned; "fus a whissle,
an' den a dog-howl, an' nobody in de
presence. Somp'n tumble is comin' to me!
Lib's been put on de block an' sold out'n
de county! Oh Lib, Lib!"</p>

<p>"Name o' Gawd, Betty, what's de matter?"
cried Liberty, springing into the
kitchen and dropping on the floor at her
feet.</p>

<p>Betty uncovered her head to look at him.
Her face on a level with his, as he knelt
before her, was working painfully.</p>

<!-- page 58 -->

<p>"Lib," she whispered, "has you been put
on de block?"</p>

<p>Liberty nodded.</p>

<p>"Den who&mdash;who is yo' new marster?"</p>

<p>"<i>Mars Van Herrin</i>'," shouted Lib, jumping
to his feet and lifting her in his powerful
arms. "Me an' de dog has come home,
Betty! <i>Home</i>, gal! Fer de res' of ou'
lives, me an' Miss Elinor's ole dog! De
<i>patter-roller</i> ain' gwine ter have a chance ter
ketch me no mo'! I gwine ter cut wood an'
fetch water fer de laklies black woman in
Texas!"</p>

<p>"Git along, you fool nigger," cried Betty.
And their joyous laughter rang in chorus
upon the still air.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>All Thornham shared the wonder and excitement
of the Man-Fig council over Vanborough
Herring's unwonted journey,&mdash;whose
object and destination remained a
mystery,&mdash;and his purchase of the valuable
negro, Liberty. The excitement increased
almost to frenzy six months later when it
transpired that he had become the owner of
Roseneath itself, which had been thrown
back by a dissatisfied buyer into Newall's
hands.</p>

<!-- page 59 -->

<p>June Badgett had struck the note; he
had coined the phrase, "<i>He has sold Miss
Thornham's diamonds</i>." There were those
who uttered this charge openly and with
confidence. Others affected not to believe
it, yet secretly accepted it as a possible solution
of the sudden change in Vanborough
Herring's fortunes. Others, again, laughed
the whole story to scorn, affirming that the
necklace itself was a myth, no one in Thornham
ever having seen the mistress of Roseneath
wear such an ornament. A few were
stoutly indignant. Among these last were
Peter Newall and Madame Anatole de Jolibois.</p>

<p>"He is incapable of such a cowardly
crime," mused the lawyer to himself, laying
down his pen in the midst of a letter to
John Thornham, wherein he mentioned that
Roseneath had been resold, but refrained
from naming its latest purchaser; "yet he
was with her that night&mdash;God forgive me
for never having told of it, if he is guilty!
I saw him enter the door which she herself
opened for him. . . . He could not have
done anything so base. . . . Where can he
have obtained money for the purchase of
Roseneath! . . . If he would only speak.

<!-- page 60 -->

... If he would only be less reticent with
me. . . . But, then, he has never forgiven
me for loving her too."</p>

<p>"It is a monstrous lie, Serena," remarked
Miss Kizzy, with her mouth full of pins&mdash;for
it was waxing and polishing day at the
Dancing-Academy. "A monstrous and inconceivable
prevarication. Something must
be done about it. I will consult Monshur
d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys when he returns from his Foreign
Mission. Get out the mops, child.
And be sure and give the Herring children
some of that fruit-cake when they come."</p>

<p>Amid this buzz of village gossip, the Vanborough
Herrings took possession of their
new home. Herring himself superintended
the replacing and arranging of the old
Thornham furniture,&mdash;much of which he
had acquired at the sale,&mdash;showing an almost
feverish wish that each familiar object
should stand in its accustomed place. His
pretty young wife, delicate-looking, but
hitherto gay and light-hearted, moved somewhat
thoughtfully about the stately many-roomed
mansion. Olive slipped into it as
if it had been her own by birthright. The
boy, Young Van, two years older, seemed, like
his mother, from the very first to fall under

<!-- page 61 -->

some subtle spell beneath the new roof-tree:
his dark thin face became strangely melancholy;
his eyes at times followed his father
about with a questioning look which made
an uneasy silence among older people, and
hushed even the noisy glee of little Jack
and little Jeanie, the two younger children.</p>

<p>It was gay enough in other respects&mdash;Roseneath!
Its lavish hospitality kept pace
with Vanborough Herring's success. For
success&mdash;the success in his profession for
which he had striven so long, so arduously,
and so abortively&mdash;had come to him with
that first mysterious turn in his fortunes.
It was suddenly discovered that he had a
profound knowledge of the law. His good
luck, as his fellow townsmen called it, became
proverbial. Even those who had most
industriously circulated the story of the
stolen jewels, hastened to employ him when
business of their own required a steady
hand, deep learning, and quiet tact. His
reputation extended, and his practice grew
far beyond the narrow limits of his own
county; and when, some years after he became
the owner of Roseneath, he ran for the
Legislature of his State, he was elected by
an overwhelming majority. In the midst of

<!-- page 62 -->

his almost phenomenal career, the wealthy
and influential legislator retained the unapproachable,
half-repellent attitude, which
had imperceptibly superseded the open,
frank, and joyous manner of the struggling
young lawyer.</p>

<p>"It's his conscience that makes him so
hide-bound, that's what it is!" asserted
June Badgett.</p>

<p>"It's his dollars, that's what it is!"
grinned Tuke Chancellor in reply.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>"I wonder how much of that abominable
gossip he has ever heard," thought Newall,
one evening as he sat at dinner at Roseneath.
Herring's clear-cut stern face was turned
toward the pretty woman on his right. She
was relating, with great vivacity and many
embellishments, the story of the Man-Fig to
the guest of honor,&mdash;a distinguished judge
from the capital.</p>

<p>"The blood of the murdered Don Manuel
Gayoso y Gonzalvo used to <i>ooze</i> from the
big purple figs," she was saying, and an affected
shiver shook her bare white shoulders,&mdash;"and
they say his ghost continues to haunt
the spot. If it does," she continued gayly,
"it has company enough! For the ghosts

<!-- page 63 -->

of murdered reputations must be pretty
thick there! And if any there be among
us who has lied or stolen, let him beware of
the Man-Fig Council."</p>

<p>At this unexpected and malapropos climax,
an uncomfortable thrill passed around the
table. The narrator flushed, biting her lips,
and dropped her eyes upon her plate, presumably
praying the earth to open and swallow
her. The distinguished guest, alone,
unaware of the inadvertent allusion, calmly
continued to eat his dinner. Newall thought
that Mrs. Herring's pale face changed its
expression. He glanced furtively at his
host. Herring's impassive face reassured
him. "She knows, perhaps," he sighed inwardly.
"Poor little lady! But I am sure
he has never heard it. Thank God. For
even in heaven where she is, Elinor Thornham
would not be happy if he were suffering."</p>

<p>His head sunk between his shoulders, and,
oblivious of the renewed hum of conversation
around him, his thoughts wandered
back into a past which included none but
himself and a</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Dear dead woman, yet unpossessed."</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>Newall had aged unaccountably during

<!-- page 64 -->

the past few years; his hair was sprinkled
with gray; the wrinkles about his eyes had
deepened; his broad shoulders drooped.
Herring on the contrary&mdash;full a year older&mdash;retained
all the spring and elasticity of
youth. His dark eyes were filled with fire;
his lithe erect figure was instinct with life
and vigor. But for the rigid lines about his
mouth, and the heavy furrow between his
straight brows, he might have been that Van
Herring of a dozen years back, who had
wooed&mdash;in this very house&mdash;and jilted the
beautiful and high-spirited Elinor Thornham.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>Newall came out of his reverie with a
start. There was a clatter of horse's hoofs
upon the shelled drive outside; a spurred
heel rang on the gallery, and a man, reeling
with fatigue, came unceremoniously into the
dining-room, with an envelope in his hand.</p>

<p>It was a messenger bringing to Vanborough
Herring the news of the surrender
of Fort Sumter.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>Within the month, the Herring Rifles,
uniformed and equipped at the expense of
their captain,&mdash;Herring himself,&mdash;were
mustered into the Confederate States Service.

<!-- page 65 -->

Jimmy Hopson, with a long knife in
his belt, and a look of grim defiance on
his round boyish face, was among them; and
Tuke Chancellor, mildly interested in "tic-tacs";
and young Duncan Jeffrey, his yellow
curls and beardless cheeks in strange
contrast with the rugged visage and grizzled
locks of his great-uncle, Major Billy
Duncan, a veteran of the Texan War for
Independence, and of the Mexican War
with the United States.</p>

<p>They went away one balmy May morning.
The entire population of Thornham&mdash;men,
women, and children&mdash;thronged about the
station, shouting themselves hoarse, throwing 
up hats and caps, and waving tear-wet
handkerchiefs, as the train drew slowly up
the road. The "boys" in their brand-new
uniforms crowded the platforms, looking
back, laughing and singing, all filled with
a mad haste to know somewhat of that fair
game, in which they were to play a losing
part. The sleek black faces of their body-servants
grinned from the car windows.</p>

<p>Liberty had climbed to the top of the rear
coach and stood there, his huge form outlined
against the sky.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Betty-gal," he shouted. "Tek

<!-- page 66 -->

keer o' de pickaninnies an' Miss Elinor's
dog! Good-by, Miss Jeanie. Good-by,
little Miss Olive! I'm gwine ter tek keer
o' little Mars Dunc an' de Cap'n!"</p>

<p>"Will you lend Liberty to me until the
war is over?" Herring had asked playfully
one day, looking down, with one of his rare
smiles, into his little daughter's face.</p>

<p>"Yes, papa," she had gravely returned.
She had "claimed" Lib, as young Van had
appropriated Magnus, from the moment
they appeared at the cottage. "He will
take care of you."</p>

<p>Duncan Jeffrey was standing near his
captain, who was completing the preparations
for departure. The tall youth of
eighteen looked bashfully at the eleven-year-old
child.</p>

<p>"And of me, Ollie," he said, blushing, he
could not have told why; "may Lib take
care of me too?"</p>

<p>And so the Herring Rifles went up to
"the front,"&mdash;that vague border-land between
friend and foe, kinsman and kinsman,
brother and brother,&mdash;ignorant, gay, defiant,
hopeful. God in Heaven help you, lads,&mdash;and
the lads across the border!</p>

train had plunged, and the answering cheer
that followed after was faint and feeble,
for it struggled through aching throats.</p>

<p>June Badgett and Rufe Drennon returned
to the Man-Fig whose straggling shade was
grateful in the noonday heat. There Dudley
Welsh presently joined them. He had a
shamefaced look, and his eyes were red.
"Dinged if I ain't goin' too," he declared,
dropping into his accustomed place at the
foot of the tree.</p>

<p>"I ain't," said June cheerfully. "I ain't

<p>"She's got my Rosy in there," said
Drennon, shuffling to his feet and staring
after the carriage. There was a note of
exultation in his monotonous voice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Herring leaned back, pale and exhausted,
among the cushions. The little
girls on the front seat&mdash;Olive, and Rose
Drennon&mdash;were chattering gayly and singing
snatches of the soldiers' farewell ditty.
But Young Van, the slim, sad-eyed boy,
pressed against his mother, flushing painfully,
and turning his head as they rolled
past the Man-Fig.</p>

<!-- page 69 -->

<p>Betty had preceded them home, and
Madame de Jolibois awaited them on the
front steps.</p>

<p>"Don't you fret yo'se'f, Miss Jeanie,
honey," Betty exhorted, helping her mistress
to alight, and gathering little Jack and little
Jeanie in her arms. "D'ain; nothin' gwine

breath.</p>

<p>"I know what it is, dear Mrs. Herring,"
said Miss Kizzy tenderly. "I am aware
of the poignancy of your feelings. I have
also an absent husband and spouse. But
they will return. Monshur d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys
and Vanborough will return loaded with

Anatole has flown on the wings of patriotism
to the aid of his adopted country. And&mdash;and,
my dear, I will come once or twice a
week to Roseneath to instruct Olive and
Young Van in their steps. But&mdash;I have
been unable to consult Monshur d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys,
who has been absent on a delicate and

<!-- page 70 -->

dangerous Mission&mdash;but Serena and I have
decided to close the Jollyboys Dancing-Academy
until the war is over. We do
not deem it proper that we should continue
to teach the Saltatory Art while our country
is in the midst of bloodshed and tribulation."</p>

<p>IV.</p>

<p class="small">YOUNG VAN.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Everybody</span> knows how it all ended!
The Herring Rifles came limping home, by
twos and threes,&mdash;ragged, forlorn, footsore,
hungry,&mdash;with defeat stamped on their
wan faces. There were not many of them
left, to be sure! Jimmy Hopson, with a bullet
through his brain, was sleeping yonder
on the bloody field of Gettysburg; Tuke
Chancellor had gone down&mdash;foremost in a
gallant charge&mdash;in the Battle of the Wilderness.
You could have counted the dead
and missing by the number of black-robed
women who stole forth to gaze yearningly in
the faces of those who came,&mdash;asked a few
low-voiced questions, and fled weeping back
to their lonely chambers. Some among
those who returned were maimed for life.
Dudley Welsh had lost an arm; Uncle
Billy Duncan had a gash exactly across that
scar on his left cheek which he had fetched
home from Chapultepec; Colonel Herring,

<!-- page 72 -->

promoted on the field for bravery, limped
heavily from an unhealed wound in his
knee; even June Badgett, who had, after
all, found time to follow the Rifles with the
first batch of recruits, was minus a couple
of fingers.</p>

<p>"Hello, Rufe!" the latter exclaimed the
day after his return, sauntering up to the
Man-Fig in company with Welsh. "Have
you been a-settin' here ever sence the war
begun, durn yo' hide?"</p>

<p>Drennon got up from the patch of grass
where he was lying. "No," he grinned, no
wise abashed by the insinuation; "I was
drafted inter the Home Gyard"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Home Gyard," interrupted June contemptuously.
"I wish my Maker may
strike me stone dead if He ever ketches me
associatin' with a d&mdash;&mdash;d white-livered
skunk-eatin' Home Gyard!"</p>

<p>Nevertheless he remained, leaning his
tired back against a post, for the fence was
quite gone. He cast his eyes over the familiar
scene. Nothing was changed,&mdash;in appearance
at least,&mdash;a little more dilapidation
here and there, perhaps,&mdash;a broken fence,
a briar-grown front yard. But the same
gray old stores, the glimpses of dark gables

<!-- page 73 -->

through the trees, the yellow sunlight warm
on the one long street; the river, low and
sullen between its bluffs; Jack Addington in
the doorway of his warehouse (Thornham's
only warehouse), shouting orders into space;
the ferryman pulling at his rope; the shaky
train across the river, rounding the bend
and rattling up to the station! ("She"
brought no thrill to June's breast now, however;
he had seen locomotives enough and
to spare during his four years' service, had
June!) His gaze sought Roseneath in the
midst of its great park-like lawn.</p>

<p>"Well," he mused rather to himself than
to his companions, "some goes out privates
an' comes back privates, an', lo, an' behole,
their wagin-an'-team has been confiscated by
a busted gover'mint, their wife an' chile is
a-layin' out yander in the graveyard; their
do' is off'n its hinges an' jimpson-weed's
growin' in their co'n-patch! Some goes
out an' don't come back at all, an' their
fam'lies mo'ns fer 'em. But Van Herrin's
luck shore sticks to <i>him!</i> Stars on his coat-collar,
Lib a-totin' his cyarpet-bag, <i>he</i> comes
back to a standin' crop, nary mule gone
fum his stables, a likely wife, an' a passel
o' sassy childern!"</p>

<!-- page 74 -->

<p>It was true. Some mysterious charm
seemed to brood over Herring's possessions.
His very fences forbore to rot. The tremendous
rise in the river which, one spring,
had desolated the plantations above and
below, had swirled around a bend somehow
and left Fair View uninjured. His negroes,
under a judicious and clear-headed overseer,
had remained at work when neighboring
fields were grass-grown for the lack of
labor. Everything had thriven and increased,&mdash;live
stock, cane, corn, grain,
fruit. Even the rose-garden at Roseneath
had never borne such a wealth of dewy,
sweet-scented, velvet-leaved roses as in that
dreary, despairing early summer of '65.
His wife, whose boundless charities and
sweet sympathy in a time of common suffering
and common hope had endeared her
anew to the community, had lost that look
of anxiety and apprehension which had
made her care-worn and prematurely old.
She met her husband at the station, on his
return, robust, joyous, radiant. Young
Van, now a fine, manly lad, no longer shrank
from companionship; Olive, blooming into
exquisite girlhood; the two younger children
glowing with health and spirits,&mdash;all

<!-- page 75 -->

this, as Badgett said, awaited the lucky man
on his return.</p>

<p>One may, perhaps, be too fortunate.</p>

<p>Who was it unchained and set loose again
that half-forgotten story? It would have
been hard to say. A whisper, a look
askance, a shrug of the shoulders, and the
thing was done. Not even in the days
which followed Vanborough Herring's first
unaccountable gleam of prosperity did gossip
rage more fiercely than now. Startling additions
were made to the original text of the
tale: Herring had wrested the necklet by
force from the dying woman; there was a
purple mark from brutal fingers on her
throat when they found her! Some one
during the war&mdash;somewhere&mdash;in New Orleans&mdash;in
Chattanooga&mdash;in Richmond&mdash;had
met the identical man to whom Herring
had sold one, or a part, or the whole, of
Elinor Thornham's diamonds.</p>

<p>"Wait till the Hand o' God strikes
him!"</p>

<p>Once more June Badgett had coined the
apposite phrase. It was in everybody's
mouth,&mdash;<i>The Hand of God!</i></p>

<p>"He was a gallant soldier," urged the
unswerving minority.</p>

<!-- page 76 -->

<p>"Of course!" retorted the majority contemptuously.
"He hoped to make the world
forget that he was a thief."</p>

<p>"He led many a gallant charge."</p>

<p>"Certainly; his conscience stung him so
that he courted death."</p>

<p>"He bore every brunt with his men, and
not the meanest ever appealed to him in
vain."</p>

<p>"No doubt! A villain must ease his soul
somehow."</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>"They do not scruple to accept his hospitality;
they eat his food and drink his wine,
and go their ways calling him a scoundrel
and a thief!" said Newall bitterly, after a
vain attempt to stem the tide of public
opinion.</p>

<p>The cloud&mdash;for a time mercifully lifted&mdash;descended
again upon the wife; her laughter
died in her throat; she became silent and
shrinking as before. Young Van gradually
lost his youthful buoyancy.</p>

<p>If Herring, always reticent and self-contained,
noted any of these things, or knew
what they betokened, he made no sign.</p>

<p>Olive alone, on the threshold of womanhood,
remained radiantly unconscious.</p>

<!-- page 77 -->

<p>Meanwhile, Thornham slowly resumed its
old-time uneventful routine. Save for the
occasional presence of a uniformed officer
representing the military government, and
the groups of negroes loafing about the
streets by way of realizing their freedom,
there was little in the tranquil town to indicate
that a world had tumbled about its
ears.</p>

<p>Finally, and last of all, The Jolibois
Dancing-Academy was reopened. A circular,
written by Madame de Jolibois, and
carried from house to house, as on a former
occasion, by Liberty, urged its patrons to
remember that the Growing Generation must
be Educated, so that our Foes in future
years may Respect them. Our Armies are
Defeated, but there Remains with us the
Consciousness of Right. Let us show the
Enemy that we can Rise above Misfortune.</p>

<p>N. B. If any of my Patrons are unable
to Pay, I will <i>gladly</i> Teach Their children
without Compensation for the sake of the
<i>Lost Cause</i>.</p>

<p>Miss Kizzy did not admit even to herself
that her joints were a little stiff from misuse&mdash;and
age. But she was secretly grateful
when Olive Herring dropped in, as she

<!-- page 78 -->

sometimes did, and offered gayly to put the
troublesome squad through its manual.</p>

<p>She leaned against the piano one March
afternoon watching the young girl skim
down the long hall with Duncan Jeffrey,
who had come back from the war with a
bullet in his shoulder, and a captain's stripe
on his ragged gray sleeve. The children,
aligned in two rows for a reel, gaped admiringly
at their leaders.</p>

<p>Miss Kizzy's heart fluttered. She felt
suddenly faint. "I am almost sure, Serena,"
she said in an undertone to her sister,
"I have a presentiment that Monshur d<i>ee</i>
Jollyboys is about to return."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," assented Miss "Fatty," playing
stolidly on, "I am sure Brother Anatole is
about to return."</p>

<p>"Do you know, Miss Kizzy," called Olive,
rosy and breathless from swinging half-round
and back with so many very young and
bashful gentlemen, "do you know that there
is going to be a ball at Roseneath next
week? In honor of Van's nineteenth birthday.
It happens to be my birthday, too.
But I don't count. I am only seventeen,"
she added with a saucy glance at Duncan,
who tried to say that she counted very much

<!-- page 79 -->

to one person at least, but stammered instead,
and blushed, and held his tongue.</p>

<p>As for Miss Kizzy, Monshur Anatole for
once went clean out of her head. Her face
became stern. It was proper enough for
the Growing Generation to learn its steps in
order to insure respect of itself from the
Enemy in future years. But for the actual
generation to dance as it were on the ashes
of the Lost Cause! That were sacrilege.
But her eyes softened once more as the
lithe young couple swayed forward again in
the dance, the blonde head of the young ex-captain
bent above Olive's brown curls, and
her eyes smiling frankly into his.</p>

<p>A vision of Monsieur Anatole walking
beside her in the Seminary grounds, that
long-gone summer day, and plucking a rose
for her hair, swam before her. "And, after
all," she reflected, "it has been nearly two
years since the surrender."</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>Even in the old days, when Steven Thornham&mdash;haughty
and imperious, but magnificently
open-handed in his mode of living&mdash;was
master there, Roseneath never wore an
aspect more royal than on the night of the
ball given in honor of the oldest son of its

<!-- page 80 -->

present owner. The countless glittering
lights, the new and costly hangings, the
gay garlands festooned from pillar to pillar
of the large ballroom, the fairy-like nooks,
bowered in palms, contrived here and there
throughout the network of rooms and hall
ways, the smooth-swept lawn with its lantern-thridded
trees&mdash;all this seemed little less
than enchantment after the sombre, denuded
years since the last ball in Thornham,&mdash;the
ball at which the Herring Rifles in their
trim new uniforms had danced the night
before they marched away to "the front."
Several of these scarred veterans looked on
somewhat wistfully while more youthful feet
beat the shining floors to the sound of joyous
music. Newall was one of these, for he too
had worn the gray. He sat unobserved in
a corner of the sitting-room with its familiar
furnishings, his eyes following the graceful
motion of the dancers through a curtained
doorway.</p>

<p>All Thornham was there. Madame de
Jolibois, sitting on a <i>causeuse</i> in a corner
of the ballroom with Miss "Fatty" (both
in wonderful toilettes created for the occasion),
regretted aloud that Monshur d<i>ee</i>
Jollyboys could not have returned from his

<!-- page 81 -->

Foreign Mission in time to be present.
"Himself a brilliant luminary of the nobility
of his native land, he would have be
held," she said, "the glittering aristocracy
of this favored region." To her inmost
self she breathed with a sigh of relief, "At
last the slander is lived down! Thank God
for Vanborough!"</p>

<p>Newall's gaze dwelt lingeringly upon
Olive, whose dark luminous eyes filled him
with vague remembrances. She stood beside
her father at the upper end of the
long ballroom. Herring's own eyes rested
tenderly for a moment upon her joyous
upturned face; then they swept over the
assemblage. A flash of pride illuminated
them, and a flush mounted to his dark
cheek. He had indeed reason to be content.
All Thornham was there! The
struggling, ill-paid, well-nigh despairing
lawyer of a decade back&mdash;to-day rich, prosperous,
planter, legislator, judge&mdash;held his
conquered world in the hollow of his hand!
Newall, in his corner, felt an answering
thrill. At that moment it seemed as if the
sun blazing in the heaven of this man's life
had at last dissipated every cloud and left
the sky serene and smiling.</p>

<!-- page 82 -->

<p>The lawyer heaved, like the dancing-mistress,
a sigh of relief, and sank back into
his seat. As he did so, a warm breath
struck his cheek. He turned, startled. A
face was pressed against the blind outside,
and a pair of eyes peered eagerly into the
room. Newall followed the direction of
the absorbed gaze. Rose Drennon, pretty,
blonde, blue-eyed, was among the dancers;
Jed Bates's arm encircled her slight waist,
her head drooped against his shoulder as
they circled slowly down the crowded ball
room. The "poor-white" father was watching
his child from the gallery! The lawyer
shifted his position, affecting not to see
the uninvited guest outside the window.
It was then that a fragment of conversation
reached him. A lady, full-blown and
voluptuous-looking, with sleek black hair
and narrow sensuous eyes, was sitting on
Elinor Thornham's couch over against
him. She was fanning herself coquettishly
and chatting with a man who sat beside
her, with his arm thrown along the back
of the lounge. Their voices had probably
been subdued hitherto, or Newall
himself had been too absorbed to hear
what they were saying. Now it seemed

<!-- page 83 -->

to him as if a thunder-tone assailed his
ears.</p>

<p>"How many of the Thornham diamonds
have gone into this, do you suppose?" the
man asked with a meaning sneer on his
long sallow face.</p>

<p>"Who can tell?" the woman responded,
lifting her shoulders. "By the way," she
added, looking around her, "I believe that
it was in this very room that he choked her
and stole her diamonds. Do you think
mine are safe from him?" And she made
a pretense of shielding with her gloved
hand the <i>rivi&egrave;re</i> of jewels adorning her own
white throat.</p>

<p>A look of ineffable horror and anguish
came into Newall's face. For Young Van,
standing unnoticed in the embrasure of a
window beyond the speakers, already pale
and melancholy, grew absolutely livid. His
lips parted; his limbs seemed to tremble
beneath him; he made an uncertain step
forward, then turned abruptly into the ball
room, glided silently through the dancers,
and passed out upon the deserted veranda.
"Poor boy! Poor lad!" sighed Newall
aloud, for he was alone in the little room.
The face behind the blind had disappeared,

<!-- page 84 -->

and the thoughtless gossipers had joined the
tide which was beginning to flow toward the
supper-room.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>The gayety of the stately mansion had its
grotesque counterpart out in the servants'
quarters, where unctuous black valets and
comely yellow maids aped the manners of
their masters and mistresses, sitting in
pompous and exaggerated decorum in
Betty's cabin, or mincing in couples up and
down the long kitchen-gallery. Crowds of
humbler retainers from Fair View swarmed
about the back yard, pressing up the steps
and peeping through open windows; and a
score or more of pickaninnies, including
Betty's five, patted <i>juba</i> and shuffled noisily
under the trees to the sound of the fiddles
in the "gret-house."</p>

<p>Liberty, whose gigantic frame seemed to
have been enlarged and strengthened by
the toil and hardship of camp-life, bustled
with an air of importance between kitchen
and supper-room; now admonishing his own
satellites in the pantry, now dictating to
Betty and her corps of assistants about her
oven-ringed fireplace.</p>

<p>"Be keerful o' dem cut-glass goblers, Jackson."

<!-- page 85 -->

"Pass in de <i>de</i>canters, Sam; don't
you see dey is fair <i>dreened!</i>" "Come
out'n dat do', Jess. Major Joe Burnham
ain' tellin' dem jokes fer de likes o' you to
laugh at!" "Betty, 'pears like you spec
white folks kin wait tell mornin' fer dem
oyshters. Hop eroun', gal, hop eroun'!"</p>

<p>"Git out'n my kitchen, Lib Thornham!"
cried Betty, flustered. "I been over
de fiah befo' ever I seed you. You ten' to
yo' business ez de <i>butler</i> an' I'll ten' to
mine ez de <i>cook!</i> <i>Gawd-a-miyhty!</i>"</p>

<p>She dropped the spoon she was flourishing,
and turned an ashen face on her husband.
The old dog, Magnus, who had been
lying in a corner of the fireplace, had dragged
himself across the kitchen, and stood on the
door-sill, howling mournfully, his purblind
eyes strangely fixed, and his feeble body
quivering.</p>

<p>"Dat ain' no hallelujah-whine like he sot
up de day you an' him come into ou' fam'ly,
Lib," Betty whimpered fearfully. "Dat's a
<i>death-howl</i>. <i>O Gawd!</i>"&mdash;she shook from
head to foot, clutching at his shoulder. For
the steady long-drawn wail arose the third
time on the air.</p>

<p>"Shet yo' fool mouth, Betty," said Liberty

<!-- page 86 -->

roughly. His own eyeballs were rolling
and his teeth were hard upon chattering.
"Ain't you see little Mars Van by de
summer-house out yander in de rose-garden!
De dog can't see out'n his eyes, but he's
got innard sight. <i>He ain' altogether human,
nohow</i>, dat dog ain'! He p'intedly knows
dat his young Marster is settin' by his-se'f
out yander in de rose-garden, in de moonlight."</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>The disordered house, the next morning,
had that dreary, almost sinister air which
follows a night of prolonged revelry. The
sun streaming in at the wide-open windows
shed a mocking light upon the wreckage of
that high tide which had surged there a few
hours agone,&mdash;fragments of lace, spangles,
shreds of tulle and ribbon strewn upon the
soiled and trampled floors; a fan tossed on
a sofa, a pair of gloves forgotten on a mantel;
here a filmy handkerchief breathing of
its dainty owner, there a faded bouquet.
Nothing so empty as a ballroom when the
light feet of the dancers have left it!</p>

<p>The spurred heels of Young Van echoed
jarringly on the silence as he crossed the
ballroom to where his mother sat, alone

<!-- page 87 -->

and abstracted, on a divan with her hands
folded idly on her lap. She looked up with
a smile, but she avoided his searching gaze.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I was just waiting for the servants
to take it all down." She made a gesture
toward the dying garlands that wreathed
the walls.</p>

<p>"Mother," the boy said abruptly, "did
you hear&mdash;were you&mdash;last night?" The
words died away in a sob. He stooped and
kissed her hastily, and strode away without
looking back.</p>

<p>She followed him slowly, and stood watching
from the gallery while he mounted the
restive horse awaiting him, and galloped
away for his morning ride. The slender
young figure, erect and graceful in the
saddle, disappeared in that turn of the road
from which ten years before June Badgett
had stood his fatal watch, and the mother
went back into the deserted ballroom.</p>

<p>She had been a pretty woman, and a
happy one in those old days when Vanborough
Herring had not had a law-case for
more than twelve months, nor a pair of new
boots for six; but beauty and happiness had
gone away together, suddenly&mdash;she could
have named you the very day and hour!

<!-- page 88 -->

They had come back for a brief space during
the time that the women of Thornham
had wept and prayed together for their
absent husbands and sons and lovers, and
made lint and cartridges, with their hearts
beating in unison,&mdash;now with rejoicing, now
with dread,&mdash;and packed boxes for the
"boys" away yonder at "the front," with
mutual hopes and mutual fears. Now, alas,
her thin face was again pinched and pitiful;
her large blue eyes were dim with much secret
weeping. Newall was right in his conjecture. 
She did know! She had heard!
And, with a mother's intuition, she had long
ago divined that the boy, too, in some way,
had heard the shameful story which had
blasted his father's reputation in the midst
of worldly success. But neither by word
nor look had mother or son betrayed to any
living soul&mdash;least of all to each other!&mdash;their
consciousness of the ever-blackening
cloud which hung above their lives; nor did
the wife know whether or not her husband
was aware of the foul stain upon his own fair
fame. She had, indeed, seen a mask settle
and harden upon his face. Did he, too, suffer?
Did he, too, writhe and groan in
secret? She could not tell. His tenderness

<!-- page 89 -->

toward herself was unabated; his love
and pride in his children were boundless.
But an invisible barrier stretched there,
where her soul would fain enter his and
share with it all it might be fated to endure
of pain or suffering, even of guilt and remorse.</p>

<p>She, too, had seen significant glances the
night before, and caught the echo of half-uttered
phrases.</p>

<p>She arose from the divan and began to
walk aimlessly about the house, which she
hated. Had its shadow not fallen across
her own life and his? And was it not here
that the woman whom he had loved first&mdash;</p>

<p>She put the rising thought aside as unworthy
of herself and him, and continued
her lonely walk, avoiding instinctively the
little nook which had been Elinor Thornham's
sitting-room.</p>

<p>The voices of her children&mdash;little Jack
and little Jeanie, romping on the gallery,
and Olive in confidential talk with Liberty&mdash;at
last penetrated to her troubled senses.
She stopped to listen, glad of the relief.</p>

<p>The younger children scampered down the
steps in hot pursuit of Betty's gang; and
their boisterous shouts died away in the distance.</p>

<!-- page 90 -->

<p>"Lawd, Miss Olive," Liberty was saying,
"didn't I been an' tole you dat tale yis<i>tid</i>dy!"</p>

<p>"I don't care, Lib," said Olive, "I want
to hear it again."</p>

<p>They were in the butler's pantry. An occasional
clatter of dishes mingled with their
talk. Liberty was replacing the Thornham
china in the tall presses built into the wall.
Rose Drennon was with them.</p>

<p>"Shucks, chile," he returned. "Dat wa'n't
a succumstanche! Mars Van was always
doin' somep'n brash. He was de braves'
man in ou' ridgment, Mars Van was!
Lawd, I has seen him a-chargin' 'long, at
de head o' de Rifles"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know," interrupted Olive impatiently,
"but that day the Rebel pickets were lying
behind a low wall, when all at once the
Federals came in sight at the edge of the
woods, just beyond the old field. And a
Rebel soldier jumped over the wall with
a flag in his hand"&mdash;</p>

<p>"He wa'n't nothin' but a boy," interrupted
Liberty in his turn, "a plum boy!
An' his yaller hair a-flyin', an' his blue eyes
a-shinin'! Lawd, Miss Olive, when dem
bluecoats come in sight he jerked up de

<!-- page 91 -->

flag, an' whooped over dat wall like a streak
o' lightnin', an' cut ercrost dat fiel' a-hollerin'
an' a-wavin' de flag. All at once dey
was a solingtary shot. It did seem like dem
bluecoats didn' had de heart to shoot dat
yaller-headed boy Reb! But de solingtary
shot done struck him in de shoulder, an'
down he come on his face on de groun' wi'
de flag onder him. Den de bluecoats come
a-chargin' todes him to git de flag. I tell
you, Miss Olive, dey was like a swarm o'
bees! De Rifle-boys jis lif' up dey heads
an' drap 'em back, a-waitin'. But dreckly
dey bus' out a-yellin' ontell you mought a'
heard 'em down here in de Brazos bottom.
Fer de cap'n, yo' pa, he riz up an' jumped
dat wall like a stag-deer, an' whiz-z-z ercrost
dat fiel'! And down he draps 'longside
de boy. An' fus' thing we knowed, here
he come <i>bookety-book!</i> wi' dat boy flung
ercrost his shoulder, an' a-wavin' dat flag in
his han'! An', Lawd, honey, by de time he
gin me de boy to tek keer of dey <i>was</i> a
scrimmage! An' we didn't git whipped&mdash;not
<i>dat time</i>," he concluded with a chuckle
of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Ah," cried the girl, her clear voice ringing 
proudly, "my father is a hero! a hero,
Liberty!"</p>

<!-- page 92 -->

<p>"I ain' never tole you who dat fool yaller-headed
boy was, has I, Miss Olive?" pursued
Lib.</p>

<p>"Why no, who was it?"</p>

<p>"Well, hit was p'intedly little Mars Dunc
Jeffrey, dat's who."</p>

<p>"Was it?" said Olive, with less enthusiasm.
"No wonder they made my father a
Colonel for bravery," she added. "He ought
to have been made a General."</p>

<p>"A hero!" echoed the wife, under her
breath. Her tear-wet eyes were sparkling
with pride. A girlish color had leaped into
her worn cheeks. "A hero!" she repeated
softly, smiling.</p>

<p>And then, what was it? A sudden and
confused murmur of voices, a trampling of
feet, a moan, as of some one or something
in pain&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do not be alarmed, Mrs. Herring,"
Newall said, meeting her as she rushed forward
with wildly beating heart, "Van"&mdash;</p>

<p>"My husband"&mdash;she gasped.</p>

<p>"No, Young Van. He has been thrown
from his horse. We hope he is not seriously
hurt. The doctor"&mdash;</p>

<p>She broke past him into the little morning-room
whither they had carried the lad.

<!-- page 93 -->

He was lying on Elinor Thornham's couch,
moaning, but quite unconscious, with the
blood oozing slowly from an ugly gash over
his temple. The doctor was bending over
him, busied already with bandages; his head
rested upon his father's knee.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>Toward nightfall, he seemed to recover
consciousness. His eyes slowly unclosed,
and, encountering his father's face, rested
there for a moment with an expression of
childlike love and confidence. Then a frown
contracted his forehead. "Mother," he
called out sharply, attempting to rise, "<i>Mother</i>,
did you hear? . . . They said . . .
diamonds . . . last night. My <i>father</i>. <i>My</i>
father!" His voice rose to a shriek. "Long
ago, when I was coming by the Man-Fig,
mother, do you remember? They said he
stole the diamonds. <i>Stole! My father!</i>"</p>

<p>A visible spasm of terror and dismay
swept through the room. Liberty, standing
at the foot of the couch, dropped the basin
he held in his hands, and cowered to the
floor. The men held their breath. Even
the mother's agony for a second was in abeyance.
She looked up at her husband with
wide frightened eyes. His gaze was fixed

<!-- page 94 -->

steadily upon the face on his knee; not a
muscle flinched, not an eyelash quivered
in his own. Miss Kizzy drew back into the
shadow of a curtain, overawed and trembling.
Olive, with her head buried in her
mother's lap, did not look up; she alone had
not heard.</p>

<p>A long silence succeeded this scene. The
sun sank lower, and the level rays, streaming
in at the open window, fell full upon the
couch. A sudden puff of wind brought in a
scent of damask-roses from the rose-garden.
The boy smiled,&mdash;a rare smile that illuminated
his pinched features. "Why, father!
. . . Mother!" he cried joyously, "we are
going back to the other house! I am so
glad."</p>

<p>The eyes which had opened for an instant
closed; a fluttering sigh escaped from the
parted lips,&mdash;and Vanborough Herring continued
to gaze on the dead face of his first-born.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>"It's the jedgment o' God," said June
Badgett, in an awed tone, looking around
upon the Man-Fig Council. "The Hand o'
God struck him at las'."</p>

<p>"<i>The judgment of God!</i>" whispered

<!-- page 95 -->

some even among those who followed the
funeral cort&eacute;ge to the Thornham family burying-ground
at Fair View. And so current
was the expression that the Reverend James
Hall, the old Rector of St. John's, deemed
it needful, when he ascended the pulpit the
following Sunday, to take as his text that
stern admonition of our Lord, "<i>Judge not
that ye be not judged</i>."</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>Old Magnus, out in the kitchen, purblind,
feeble, gaunt, knew, by that "innard sight"
which was his, when his little master in the
great-house closed his eyes, to open them
in that other house whither he went. And
he also went his way,&mdash;following the lad,
perhaps! who knows?</p>

<p>For, when Liberty and Betty came out of
the little room, that night, where they were
no longer needed, they found the dog in his
accustomed place in the corner of the fire
place, dead, with his shaggy head between
his paws.</p>

<p class="small">STORMED AT BY SHOT AND SHELL.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Young Van</span> had been sleeping in the
plantation cemetery at Fair View for half
a year; it might indeed have been half a
century, so rank and matted were the roses
above his grave; so stained and mildewed
the slender cross at its head!</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopson came out upon the back gallery
at Roseneath. She had a shawl over
her head, though the late August afternoon
was warm and sultry; for Aunt Patty was
getting on in years, and her blood had lost
its heat. It was not the first time that the
housekeeper had been left in charge of the
place and its belongings. In the old days
when Alcalde Steven Thornham made his
exciting and often dangerous horseback trips
about the sparsely settled country, or journeyed
to Saltillo to confer with the Government
of Coahuila and Texas, it was to Aunt
Patty&mdash;then younger by many years, sturdy,

<!-- page 97 -->

clever, and masculine&mdash;that he confided the
care of his wife and children, and the management
of the house. During the prolonged
absences of the family abroad and
elsewhere, in later times, or of Elinor
Thornham when Roseneath passed into her
possession, it was still Aunt Patty who kept
the shadowy rooms in order, and scolded
and managed, and cared for the troop of
idle house-servants.</p>

<p>After many years, she was once more
temporary mistress there, Colonel Herring
having taken his wife and the remaining
children to a neighboring town, in the vain
hope of finding some alleviation for the
mother's silent and despairing grief over the
death of her son.</p>

<p>"Hit's sholy a fine day, Miss Patty,"
called Betty from her cabin door, where she
sat, fat and comfortable, with her brown and
yellow brood tumbling about on the ground
at her feet.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopson traveled slowly down the
steps with her hand on the rail, and walked
across the kitchen-yard. Her eyes were
fixed upon the western sky. The sun had
set, but a band of coppery red stretched
along the horizon, whence tongues of flame-tipped

<!-- page 98 -->

cloud shot up toward the zenith. A
curious light filtered downward, suffusing
the still air; the treetops swam in it, as
in a sea of molten sulphur; the green of
the grassplots and tufts of shrubbery beneath
was changed to a sickly and livid
yellow.</p>

<p>The old lady shook her head. "Don't
talk to me about fine days, Betty, with that
sky over us!" she said impressively. "I've
seen that sky twice before in my lifetime,&mdash;once
on the Gulf coast and once inland.
Do you know what that sky means, Betty?
<i>It means yellow fever!</i>"</p>

<p>"Lawd, Miss Patty, you don't sesso!"
cried Betty. "An' ou' white folks, an' Lib,
yander, plum under de eedge o' dat yaller
sky, I reckon! Gawd-a-mighty sen' dat
Miss Jeanie, ner Mars Van, ner Miss Olive,
ner dem two chillen don' ketch it. Ez fer
my ole man, I ain' nowise skeered 'bout
him. Caze, you knows yo'se'f, Miss Patty,
de yaller fever don't tetch niggers."</p>

<p>A month later the yellow fever broke out
without warning on the Gulf coast; almost
simultaneously it appeared in the town
where the Herrings were staying; yet ten
days, and it was declared epidemic; a rigid

<!-- page 99 -->

cordon of quarantine was drawn about the
infected places, and an agonized cry went out
for nurses.</p>

<p>The train that brought this news to
Thornham carried on its outward trip the
next day four passengers. The Reverend
James Hall, tall, spare, and erect, in spite of
his threescore and ten years, seated himself
in the empty coach and deposited his traveling-bag
beside him. He shook hands through
the window with two or three of his parishioners
who had come to see him off, and
gazed a little wistfully over their heads&mdash;his
lips moving as if in silent benediction&mdash;at
the slim spire of St. John's rising above
the treetops on the other side of the river.
He frowned as Dud Welsh slouched awkwardly
into the car and took a seat on the
opposite side of the aisle.</p>

<p>"So you will not take my advice and stay
at home, Dudley," he said. "You are running
a great risk."</p>

<p>"So are you, sir," grinned the one-armed
Dud, stretching out his long legs and thrusting
his remaining hand into his trousers'
pocket.</p>

<p>"I am doing my duty," said the Reverend
Mr. Hall severely.</p>

<!-- page 100 -->

<p>"So am I, sir," retorted Dud promptly,
his bashful grin broadening.</p>

<p>At this moment there was a bustle among
the slim crowd of idlers on the platform
outside, and Aunt Patty Hopson and Madame
de Jolibois were hoisted one after another
up the steps, and ushered into the car.
Miss Serena her face swollen with weeping,
handed up two well-worn carpet-bags,
and turned away, sobbing aloud. Amid an ominous
silence the train jerked forward and
crept around the bend.</p>

<p>"I've had it," said Mrs. Hopson, cheerfully
settling into her place, "and I ain't at
all afraid."</p>

<p>"I ain't had it," Dud said, "but I've
seen it. I'm not afeared nuther. 'Tain't
half as skeery as goin' into a fight."</p>

<p>"I have not had it," observed the Reverend
Mr. Hall in his slow soft voice, "and I
have never seen it, but I am not afraid."</p>

<p>Miss Kizzy, looking out of the window,
said nothing. She had not had it; she knew
nothing about it; and she was horribly afraid.
"And yet, Serena," she had declared as they
toiled together up the steep bank from the
ferry and came in sight of the waiting train,
"and yet I could not properly respect myself

<!-- page 101 -->

if I did not go. Monshur d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys
wears the ribbon of the Legion of
Honor in his buttonhole. I am sure, were
he here, he would counsel me to go."</p>

<p>They were on their way&mdash;these four&mdash;to
the fever-stricken town, into which any
one might enter, but whence no one, once
within that guarded heart of pestilence,
could come out. They had volunteered
their services as nurses,&mdash;sorely needed;
for already the living were hard bestead to
bury the dead, so swift and deadly had been
the spread of the plague.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>When the late December frosts finally
came, the epidemic ceased for want of further
victims. The quarantine was lifted;
the devastated towns began once more to
take breath and to count their losses. Then
those so long absent from Thornham came
home,&mdash;some of them!</p>

<p>Colonel Herring came graver and more
unapproachable than ever; Olive, pale and
fragile after a struggle for life, and Madame
de Jolibois, and Dudley Welsh, looking
older, each by a score of years, and Liberty.
These stepped from the train one day into
a group of waiting friends, who gazed upon

<!-- page 102 -->

them with a sort of hushed awe, as upon
those who had come up from the bosom of
the charnel-house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Herring, with little Jack and little
Jeanie, was left behind in the wide grave
which had received them all, the same day.
Aunt Patty Hopson, her long service to the
Thornhams ended, rested quite near. And
the narrow ridge over against them covered
the mortal remains of the Reverend James
Hall, who went calmly about ministering to
fever-stricken bodies and sin-sick souls, with
the plague racking his own old frame, and
passed over at length, even as Faithful did,
holding by the hand one who, like Christian,
was afraid.</p>

<hr/>

<div class="center" id="ch06">

<p>VI.</p>

<p class="small">A CONFESSION.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> children went out decorously, one by
one, turning at the door to make formal
little bows "with the hand on the heart,
and the hat gracefully lifted," or to drop
solemn and antiquated "curcheys." Miss
"Fatty" Dibbs waddled after them to see
that the front gate was properly fastened.
Madame de Jolibois sank red and panting
on the horsehair sofa; drops of perspiration
coursed their way along the wrinkles in her
cheeks, and fell, dampening her muslin neckerchief;
the rose behind her ear drooped
on its stem. Olive Herring, flitting about
the dancing-hall, and humming under her
breath the last tune which Miss Serena had
drawn from the jangling piano, forbore to
look at her. Miss Kizzy's profession, in
truth, was beginning to be burdensome. Her
joints were stiff; her step had grown heavy.
But no one dreamed of suggesting her retirement.
Thornham was, above all, conservative.

<!-- page 104 -->

It is quite likely that no one except
Olive ever remembered to think that Miss
Keziah was rising fifty, and might almost be
regarded as an old woman; and quite likely,
too, that Miss Keziah herself would have
been aghast at the idea of intrusting the
very young ladies and gentlemen of Thornham
into other hands than her own.</p>

<p>"But she certainly will have to have an
assistant," thought the young girl, glancing
at her furtively.</p>

<p>"Olive," said Madame de Jolibois after
a restful silence, "have you seen St. John's
new preacher?"</p>

<p>St. John's, it will be remarked, was very
low-church indeed. Nobody, as yet, had
ever dreamed of calling its incumbent the
Rector, or of addressing him as Father.
Thornham referred to him as "the minister,"
"the preacher," or even "the parson,"
as if he were a mere dissenter. St. John's,
indeed, differed from the other religious denominations
in Thornham only in a sort of
fictitious exclusiveness, which melted before
the first Methodist quarterly meeting, or
Baptist sociable.</p>

<p>The Reverend James Hall&mdash;wise, liberal,
and saintly soul&mdash;had been the first and

<!-- page 105 -->

sole incumbent of St. John's. To the place
left vacant by his death had been called the
Reverend Mark Kennison, from one of the
older States,&mdash;young, eager, and devout.</p>

<p>"No," returned Olive, interested, seating
herself beside her old friend; "my father
and I have been at Fair View ever since he
came. Have you seen him, Miss Kizzy?
Have you heard him preach? What is he
like?"</p>

<p>Madame de Jolibois got up and went to
the front door. "Serena!" she called to
her sister, pottering about among the hollyhocks, 
"go around into the back yard and
set Alexander H. Stephens on his feet. I
heard him crow some time ago. Alexander
H. Stephens, my dear," she explained over
her shoulder, "is our new Cochin China
rooster. Dr. Alsbury sent him to us last
week. He is a most magnificent fowl. But,
unfortunately, whenever he crows he topples
over, and he cannot rise without assistance.
Serena is obliged to set him on his feet several
times a day. I am not <i>quite</i> sure that
I did hear him crow this time," she added,
coming back to her place on the sofa, "but
Serena is very fond of him, and if she gets
into the back yard where he is, she will remain

<!-- page 106 -->

until I remind her to return to the
house. The truth is, my child, I wanted to
get rid of Serena for a little while. I have
something on my mind,"&mdash;her voice dropped
to a mysterious whisper. She grasped her
companion's shoulder and regarded her
searchingly. Olive clasped her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Kizzy!" she breathed, trembling
with delightful anticipation, "has Monsieur
Anatole returned?" Monsieur Anatole,
the radiant, romantic hero of her
childish dreams! She had never seen him,&mdash;he
had in fact departed on his "Foreign
Mission" before she was born,&mdash;but she
knew him well, that generous, high-minded,
brave, beautiful Frenchman, of whom Miss
Kizzy had talked to her ever since she could
remember.</p>

<p>"No, child, Monshur Anatole has not yet
returned, though I am expecting him at any
moment." She paused to rearrange the
faded rose in her hair. "I do not dare confide
in Serena. Serena is too excitable, and
she is sometimes indiscreet. She admitted
to Mrs. Washington the other day that
Tommy Doren has his lessons free. It is
true, Mrs. Washington wormed it out of
her! Well, young as you are, Olive, I

<!-- page 107 -->

know I can trust you, and I cannot, I really
cannot bear the dreadful burden longer
alone."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Kizzy!" exclaimed Olive again,
fairly beside herself with curiosity.</p>

<p>"It happened last fall," continued Madame
de Jolibois solemnly, "the night after
your poor dear mother was laid in her grave,
with little Jack and little Jeanie; and before
you yourself were taken down. Aunt
Patty Hopson and I were nursing a family
of poor people,&mdash;seven of them in the same
room, and all with raging fever; two of the
children past help, one already with black
vomit. You know how it was,&mdash;the doctors
exhausted, the nurses hardly able to
stand on their feet from fatigue, the dead
lying about waiting to be buried; the sick
dying by scores, new cases reported every
hour." Olive shuddered and grew pale, but
the narrator, absorbed in her gruesome reminiscences,
did not notice this. "It was after
midnight when one of the doctors&mdash;a Dr.
Robinson, a most interesting person&mdash;came
to beg one of us to take charge of a man,&mdash;a
stranger, who was down with the fever,
and alone, in a house not far away. I went.
The patient was a young man; he was delirious,

<!-- page 108 -->

and had, it appeared, but a slim
chance for recovery. The doctor gave me
some directions and went on his round, leaving
me in sole charge of the patient. Toward
morning, he seemed to sink rapidly; his feet
became icy cold. I looked about for an extra
covering, but could find nothing. Fortunately
I had donned my winter undergarments. I
stepped behind the tall headboard of the
bed, and&mdash;it was an emergency, remember
that, Olive, an emergency!&mdash;and divested
myself of my flannel petticoat. In this garment
I enveloped the young man's feet, rubbing
them at the same time with all my
strength. At this critical moment Dr. Robinson
returned and lent his assistance. The
young man recovered. He is at this moment
in Thornham. He is the new minister
of St. John's."</p>

<p>Miss Kizzy paused, overcome with emotion,
and blew her bossy nose.</p>

<p>Olive continued to gaze at her, expectantly.</p>

<p>"Think of it!" Madame de Jolibois
went on, lifting her clasped hands. "Think
of it! The pedal extremities of a strange
young man enfolded in my flannel garment!"</p>

<!-- page 109 -->

<p>"But dear Miss Kizzy!" remonstrated
Olive, divided between a feeling of disappointment 
and a desire to laugh, "if the
man was unconscious, he could know nothing
about it; besides"&mdash;</p>

<p>"What <i>he</i> thinks is of no consequence,"
interrupted the dancing-mistress. "It is
the just resentment of Monshur d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys
that appalls me. The doctor may have
mentioned the fact to the interesting young
man,&mdash;I admit that he is interesting. The
young man may speak of it to some imprudent
member of his congregation. Monshur
d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys may hear of it! If
Monshur d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys hears of it, I fear
there will be bloodshed. Monshur d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys
is a husband, and not even the sacred
calling of the Reverend Mark Kennison
can save him from the marital wrath of an
injured consort. It is time you were going,
child," she added, with a sudden return to
her ordinary brisk tone of voice; "Betty
will be getting anxious. Where is your
shawl? You wore none! What imprudence!
Wait, I will get Serena's nubia."</p>

<p>She bustled away, amid Olive's protests,
and presently reappeared with a scarlet
worsted, home-knitted scarf, which she wound

<!-- page 110 -->

about the girl's shoulders. "Now, then, run
along," she ordered authoritatively; "I will
recall Serena."</p>

<p>They walked across the yard together.
Around a corner of the kitchen, they saw
Miss Dibbs. She was hovering over a
wheelbarrow, from which a tall, ungainly,
whity-brown fowl was pecking some grains
of corn. Her large flabby face expressed
delight, not unmingled with apprehension.
Alexander H. Stephens was plainly making
preparations to crow. He stretched his long
neck upward, and lifted his stumpy wings.
There was a flapping sound, followed by an
unearthly "<i>yawp!</i>" and then a small whirlwind
of dust, in the midst of which Mr.
Stephens's yellow legs beat the air helplessly,
as he writhed on his back at Miss
Serena's feet.</p>

<p>"He is a most remarkable biped," observed
Madame de Jolibois absently, as she
moved on. "Yes, there will be bloodshed,
Olive, for Monshur d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys is a <i>husband</i>."</p>

<p>Olive unlatched the little side gate, and
stepped into the open common which
stretched between the Dibbs freehold and
Roseneath; her restrained laughter, girlish,

<!-- page 111 -->

gay, and musical, broke forth as she flew
along the brown path like a swallow, her
bare head dipped forward, and the long
ends of the scarf floating behind her like a
pair of scarlet wings.</p>

<p>Vanborough Herring's daughter had far
outstripped her childhood's promise of
beauty. The reddish-brown ringlets had
given place to a crown of dusky braids,
with glints of gold in their curling ends;
the level eyebrows and the long lashes shading
the shining eyes, with their frank, virginal
expression, had darkened; the pale
oval of the cheeks was touched with a faint
and exquisite color; there were adorable
dimples in the corners of the expressive
mouth; the round white throat sloping
away from the chin softened its somewhat
too severe outlines; the slim, erect figure
had the supple grace of a wild-wood sapling.
The sorrows which had touched her young
life had left a certain questioning wistfulness
at times in the girl's face; but the
healthful joy of living pervaded her whole
being; it radiated from her like an atmosphere,
and wrought consciously upon those
about her. Even the stern set face of her
father relaxed at her approach. More successful

<!-- page 112 -->

than ever, more publicly honored, if
privately censured, his whole thought seemed
now to be centred in the welfare and happiness
of this last remaining scion of his house.
She was rarely out of his sight. Her fearlessness
in his presence, her open admiration
of him, the gay <i>camaraderie</i> of her
attitude toward him, contrasted curiously
with the silent and shrinking devotion
offered him of late years by his wife and
oldest son.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopson's place as housekeeper and
guardian had not been filled. Liberty and
Betty, relieved of all other duties, were
charged with the sole care of the young
mistress, whom they adored. The latter,
clumsy of speech but deft of finger, and
full of motherly wisdom, guarded her nursling
with jealous solicitude. Liberty attended
her on her walks and drives, swelling
with pride in the importance of his
position.</p>

<p>It was her father's wish that the young
heiress should take her place as chatelaine
of Roseneath, at the expiration of the year
of mourning; and already workmen were
busy renovating the red-brick mansion, and
putting the half-neglected grounds in order.</p>

<!-- page 113 -->

<p>"So soon?" breathed Olive, with her
head on her father's shoulder. "My
mother"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your mother would have wished it," her
father said, the muscles of his face twitching
painfully.</p>

<p>"Van Herrin' has plum fergot the tradegy
sent on him fer his sins less'n a year ago,"
said Badgett, wagging his head dismally.
"But jest you wait! The jedgment o' God
ain't done a-strikin' him yit!"</p>

<p>Even June Badgett, however, forgot his
evil prognostications when Van Herring's
daughter smiled frankly at him. And when,
one day, in passing the Man-Fig, she paused
to shake his hand, and say in her clear low
voice, "That was a gallant charge at Malvern
Hill, where you were wounded, Mr.
Badgett! I wish I had been there,"&mdash;he
was so overcome that he wished his Maker
would strike him stone dead if he ever said
anything ag'in' Van Herrin' again, bless her
soft eyes!</p>

<p>But habit in a man verging upon sixty
is too strong to be broken by the smile of a
girl!</p>

<p>"I ought not to have stayed so long. I
ought to have told Liberty to come and

<!-- page 114 -->

fetch me home," murmured Olive, glancing
at the sunset sky as she sped homeward.
"Papa will be uneasy; and oh, how Maum
Betty will scold!" She laughed gayly;
then she stood suddenly still, paralyzed with
terror. The black mass thundering upon
her was Balder, the great vicious bull which
belonged to her father. He had escaped,
somehow, from the pasture, and his eyes,
as he rushed about the common, tearing up
the earth and shaking his tremendous horns
in the air, had caught the red gleam of the
scarf floating from her shoulders! He
lunged toward her, bellowing and snorting.
Her feet, heavy as lead in the path, refused
to obey her volition; her arms dropped
helplessly; she shuddered, closing her eyes.
A swift vision shot across her brain of her
father awaiting her in the dim library; of
Van and herself at play under the orange-trees
at the "other house;" of her mother's
white face on the coffin pillow! She felt
upon her eyelids the dust thrown up by the
infuriated animal.</p>

<p>A startled cry resounded on the air; and
she felt herself caught up and swept from
her feet. A confused noise and a volley of
shouts and imprecations filled her terrified

<!-- page 115 -->

ears. She opened her eyes to find the face
of Duncan Jeffrey close to her own, as he
bore her, running, toward the park-gate of
Roseneath. A glance back over his shoulder
showed her the towering form of Liberty
swaying from side to side in a titanic wrestle
with the bellowing brute.</p>

<p>This is what had happened. Jeffrey,
lurking about the neighborhood of the
Dancing-Academy, for reasons best known
to himself, had seen Olive come out of the
side gate and start homeward. Following
her at a little distance with the intention of
joining her, yet strangely timorous at the
thought, he had seen her danger, and had
reached her barely in time to snatch her
from under the very horns of the maddened
beast. But it was Liberty&mdash;sent
in quest of her by Betty&mdash;rushing behind
him, who had thrown his own huge bulk in
front of them both and seized the bull&mdash;literally
by the horns.</p>

<p>"<i>Run, Mars Dunc, run! Fer Gawd-a-mighty's
sake, run!</i>" shouted the negro,
jerked from his feet and tossed backward
and forward, but keeping his grip with grim
determination.</p>

<p>It seemed a long time, but it was the work

<!-- page 116 -->

of a moment for Jeffrey to dart with his light
burden across the intervening space and
reach the large gate. It swung open at his
approach, and he laid the half-unconscious
girl in the arms of the man who sprang forward
to receive her, and turned back, running
at the top of his speed. As he approached
the struggling dust-enveloped mass
from which hoarse roars, human and brute,
arose together, Liberty got a "purchase,"
as he afterward expressed it, on the wide
horns, and gave them a powerful sidewise
wrench, which broke the creature's neck.<sup>1</sup>
It plunged forward suddenly, and fell, a
mighty lifeless heap on the trodden turf.</p>

<p class="small">[<sup>1</sup> A fact.]</p>

<p>" 'Fo' Gawd, Mars Dunc," the black giant
said, wiping the perspiration from his forehead
and drawing a deep breath, "I feels
like I been havin' a tussle wi' ole Satan
his-se'f! He was a fine bull, Balder was,
an' he had de strenk o' de debble! You
ain' come too soon ter save little Miss, Mars
Dunc!"</p>

<p>The young man grasped the negro's dusty
hand in his. "Good God, Lib," he cried
hoarsely, "what would have become of her
if it had not been for <i>you!</i>"</p>

<!-- page 117 -->

<p>Olive leaned, trembling, against the arm
which sustained her, watching with horror-stricken
eyes the scene on the common.</p>

<p>"Do not be alarmed, Miss Herring," said
a grave and gentle voice; "no one is hurt,
I am sure, and you see that the animal can
do no more mischief."</p>

<P>Even in the midst of her agitation, the
girl was aware of a curious thrill. No one
had ever called her Miss Herring before!
She blushed and looked hastily up. Her
glance encountered a pair of dark serious
eyes which were bent kindly upon her.
Their owner, a man whose grave and somewhat
careworn face belied the youthfulness
of his figure, smiled upon her reassuringly.
There was a hint of condescension in his tone
as he said:&mdash;</P>

<p>"I am Mark Kennison, your rector. I
had just been to call on your father. You
had a narrow escape," he continued, looking
over to where Jeffrey and the negro still
stood beside their prostrate foe. "I saw it
all, and I"&mdash;Speech suddenly failed
him, as he noted clearly for the first time
the features uplifted to his own. He drew
the girl's hand through his arm&mdash;for she
was still faint and trembling&mdash;without

<!-- page 118 -->

another word, and led her along the darkening 
avenue to the house. She walked silently
beside him, Miss Kizzy's grotesque
story struggling confusedly in her mind with
an odd sense of gratitude toward this
stranger who&mdash;had he saved her life? "No,
it was Duncan who saved me!" she said to
herself. "<i>Duncan!</i>" she repeated. Yet
the feeling, in spite of herself, remained,
which gave to Mark Kennison the place,
momentarily at least, which of right belonged
to the friend of her childhood. Curiously
enough, her father, who heard the
story in grim silence, involuntarily shared
this feeling. He wrung the hand of the
young minister, a few broken words of
thanks escaping his pale lips. Kennison
disclaimed any share in Olive's rescue from
peril, eagerly recounting the part played
therein by Jeffrey and Liberty, both unknown
to him even by name.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when Duncan, a little later,
made his appearance, followed by Lib, he
found himself relegated to the background.
Olive, indeed, met him with outstretched
hands, and his former colonel, less reserved
with him than with the rest of the world,
thanked him warmly. But something&mdash;somehow&mdash;was

<!-- page 119 -->

lacking. The young
planter stood for a moment irresolute, his
honest blue eyes clouding, as he glanced
from his own dusty and disordered dress to
the parson's trim and elegant figure; then,
with a hasty and awkward adieu, he went
away.</p>

<p>Kennison remained to the late dinner,&mdash;one
of the institutions at Roseneath much
disapproved of by Thornham in general,
and the Man-Fig Conclave in particular,&mdash;and
spent the evening with Miss Herring
and her father on the moonlighted veranda.</p>

<p>That night Liberty, whose exploit was
the wonder and admiration of the Quarters,
and who had no cause to complain of lukewarmness
on the part of his beloved mistress,
or the master, stood thoughtfully
gazing up at the ceiling after he and Betty
had retired to the privacy of their own
cabin.</p>

<p>"What you doin', Lib?" queried Betty
from the four-post bed in the corner.</p>

<p>"I'm kiverin' up de fire, honey," he replied,
without moving.</p>

<p>"Dass a lie, Lib, an' you knows it!
What you got in dat woolly haid o' yo'n?"</p>

<p>"I'm gwine ober in my min'," returned

<!-- page 120 -->

Lib slowly, "de recollections of de way you
shuck me when you was a gal, fer dat no-count
Baptiss preacher, Jack Yates."</p>

<p>"Lawd, Lib," giggled Betty, among her
pillows, "I did 'n keer nothin' 'bout Jack
Yates! I was jis <i>a-tryin' you!</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Is dat so?</i>" And Liberty's solemn
face relaxed into a relieved smile.</p>

<p>In the great house, Big Hannah, Betty's
oldest daughter, who slept on the floor in
her young mistress's room, was also awake
and pondering.</p>

<p>"I ain' never seen Miss Olive restless in
her sleep befo'," she reasoned, "an' it's de
fus time Mars Dunc Jeffrey ever rid away
from dis house widout stayin' fer dinner.
<i>An' dat preacher-man is mighty good-lookin'!</i>"</p>

<p>VII.</p>

<p class="small">GOOD LUCK PLANTATION.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>, the motherless daughter of Rufe
Drennon, had kept pace with Olive Herring
in her development into womanhood. Small
and graceful in figure, with innocent blue
eyes, a profusion of ashen-blonde hair, and
a round infantile face, she presented a striking
contrast in appearance to the heiress of
Roseneath; and there were those in the
village who thought the common laborer's
only child far more attractive than her
patrician friend.</p>

<p>For, the two girls, after Olive's vigorous
championship of Rose at the dancing-school,
became at once inseparable. Through the
thoughtful generosity of Mrs. Herring, the
little "poor-white" shared all the advantages
possessed by that lady's own children.
Punctually every morning, from the cabin
on the outskirts of the town, where Drennon
lived, the child made her appearance at
Roseneath. There, in the airy schoolroom,

<!-- page 122 -->

season after season, the youthful pair
studied from the same books,&mdash;the reddish-brown
curls and the blonde locks intermingled;
they bewailed together the
stony-heartedness of successive governesses,
drawing and music masters; they listened
together to Liberty's stories of the war; and
to Betty's wonderful "ghos' " tales; together
they were instructed in the mysteries of the
still-room by Aunt Patty Hopson,&mdash;romping
and frolicking between whiles about the
shaded grounds and through the mazy rose-garden
in company with Young Van and
Duncan Jeffrey.</p>

<p>Rufe Drennon's dull eyes gleamed with a
sort of torpid pride when he saw his child
hand in hand with the daughter of Van
Herring. He was, himself, thus relieved
of all paternal responsibility, more stolidly
shiftless than ever, loafing from day's end
to day's end under the Man-Fig, while a
"hired nigger" (paid by Mrs. Herring)
looked after the cabin in the midst of its unkempt
bit of field. Small wonder that Rose&mdash;sweet
and shallow Rose! with her inherited
indolence, and her cultivated sense of refinement&mdash;should,
as she grew older, spend
more and more of her time at Roseneath.</p>

<!-- page 123 -->

<p>After his wife's death, Herring continued
without question her lavish bounty toward
her <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</i>. And so it was that a stranger
happening upon them would have supposed
Rose, as well as Olive, a daughter of
the house.</p>

<p>Neither had the position of Duncan Jeffrey
in the household changed in all these
years. An orphan with no near relative
except the choleric grand-uncle,&mdash;a pioneer
into the country with Steven Thornham,&mdash;the
lad had found his only idea of
home-life under Vanborough Herring's roof.
Honest, manly, and chivalric by nature, his
attitude toward the Herring children had
always been that of an elder brother. For
Olive, there was an added and a tenderer
feeling. He had barely reached his seventh
birthday when Mrs. Herring called him,
one morning, into her own room, and, smiling,
laid in his arms a tiny sleeping creature
who sighed contentedly as her dark
head fell against his shoulder. A curious
sensation stirred the boy,&mdash;forgotten immediately,
but remembered and felt again
the day when, smarting under Madame
de Jolibois's stern reproof, he had heard
his little playfellow's whispered words of

<!-- page 124 -->

praise; remembered, and never lost sight of
again. He had long called the feeling by
its true name. "<i>I love her</i>," he said to
himself, springing into battle at the head of
his company, or trudging, a barefoot soldier,
about the frozen roads of Virginia. "<i>I
love her</i>," he murmured, looking up from
his books at midnight in his college dormitory;
the phrase broke involuntarily from
his lips beneath the shadow of old-world
monuments, or in presence of storied works
of art. "Does she love me?" The question
must needs shake his soul, but the time was
not yet.</p>

<p>When Uncle Billy Duncan&mdash;scarred veteran
of three wars&mdash;died, soon after the
boys in gray came marching home, his
grand-nephew and sole heir succeeded to
his fine estate, impaired, but not materially,
by the war. A couple of years spent in
study, another in foreign travel, and the
young ex-officer settled at Good Luck, his
plantation, and threw himself with ardor
into its management.</p>

<p>Good Luck, with its outstretching cane-fields,
lay on the west bank of the river, a
few miles above Thornham. Its owner, as
he rode thitherward in the falling dusk,

<!-- page 125 -->

after his meeting with the new Rector of
St. John's, was grimly thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Why have I waited?" he asked himself
savagely; "why,&mdash;when for years I have
had the sanction of both her father and
mother! Why have I not spoken? What
a fool, an idiot, I have been to hold back,
thinking her still a child, and fearing lest I
might frighten her! How her eyes shone
as she looked at him! The god has come,
the half-god must go! '<i>Balder is dead</i>.'</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">" 'Balder the Beautiful is dead, is dead.' "</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>He broke into the fragment of song,
laughing not too mirthfully at the whimsical
association of ideas. He sang, in a sonorous,
musical baritone, another couplet of
the ballad, then fell silent again.</p>

<p>"No, he is <i>not</i> a prig,&mdash;the Reverend
Mark Kennison!" he broke out aloud, answering
some rising thought within; "he is
an agreeable, manly fellow, and remarkably
handsome."</p>

<p>This last reflection provoked a sigh which
was superfluous. For the speaker could
have given odds to most men on the score
of good looks. He was somewhat above the
common height, with a finely proportioned

<!-- page 126 -->

figure, which was at once graceful and commanding.
His frank expressive face, almost
perfect in outline, was lighted by a pair of
dark blue eyes, whose steady gaze betokened
strength and sincerity of purpose; his close-cut
mustache was dark-brown, but the clustering
curls shading his broad forehead were
yellow as spun gold. Many an old veteran
of the war, who has perhaps forgotten graver
things, still recalls with delight the lad "wi'
yaller hair a-flyin'," with the light of the
camp-fire on his bonny brow, or the smoke
of battle griming his boyish face!</p>

<p>"Yes, he is a fine fellow,&mdash;if he <i>is</i> a
preacher," he repeated emphatically.</p>

<p>Already the bitterness had died out of his
voice; the unwonted mood had passed. But
the poignant question, until that moment
hardly framed, "Can I win her?" remained.</p>

<p>"But I <i>will</i> win her, or die," he cried
fiercely, turning in at his own gate, which
swung open at the sound of his horse's galloping
hoofs, while from the fence half a
score of pickaninnies shouted a welcome to
their indulgent young master.</p>

<p>He laughed inwardly at his own foolish
fears and misgivings, when he presented

<!-- page 127 -->

himself as usual at Roseneath the next afternoon.
He found Olive and Rose in the little
sitting-room with Madame de Jolibois.</p>

<p>"Ah, here he is!" cried Olive, her eyes
sparkling, though a quiver of the lip betrayed
her emotion on seeing him. "Come
in, Duncan. Here is Miss Kizzy wanting
to know how it all happened. And so do I.
For I saw nothing but the bull."</p>

<p>Miss Kizzy turned pale, and her lips
moved. Rose said afterward that they
plainly framed <i>gentleman-cow!</i></p>

<p>"I had very little to do with it," Jeffrey
declared, shaking hands with his old instructress. 
"It was Lib who carried the
day. His arms must be out of joi&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But <i>you</i> carried off the spoils, Duncan,"
interrupted Rose demurely.</p>

<p>They all laughed at this. Olive blushed,
but kept her frank eyes on Duncan's face.
His own were dropped, lest in their depths
might be read the tremulous joy which still
possessed him, when he remembered that he
had clasped her in his arms, that her head
had rested against his shoulder as he bore
her toward&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Mark Kennison."</p>

<p>He looked up with a sudden inward shock.

<!-- page 128 -->

Kennison had entered the room from the
library where he had been sitting with his
host, and was being formally presented to
Rose.</p>

<p>The young men shook hands cordially,
Duncan's momentary confusion passing like
a cloud before the open greeting of the
stranger. Kennison looked with vaguely
puzzled eyes at Madame de Jolibois, who,
sitting bolt upright on the sofa, acknowledged
the introduction with a dignified
bow. The talk ran for a few moments upon
the adventure of the day before, then Olive,
who was beginning to tremble nervously
over the recollection of her danger, changed
its current by turning to Miss Kizzy and
inquiring&mdash;</p>

<p>"How is Alexander H. Stephens?"</p>

<p>"He has ceased forever to crow," Miss
Kizzy returned solemnly. "Serena is profoundly
affected. We think it was too much
corn."</p>

<p>Kennison looked mystified.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so sorry," said Olive hysterically.</p>

<p>Jeffrey swallowed a laugh. "And the
Academy, Miss Kizzy?" he asked. "I hope
the boys have improved since my time."</p>

<!-- page 129 -->

<p>"Your deportment&mdash;even as a very
young gentleman&mdash;was always excellent,
Duncan," replied Madame de Jolibois politely.
"You will be interested to learn,
my dear," she added, turning to Olive, "that
we have decided upon employing an assistant.
A most momentous decision." She
shook her head gravely.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Olive with lively sympathy;
"whom have you chosen?"</p>

<p>"Sarah Ann Hunter,&mdash;one of our graduates
who does not wish to be entirely dependent
upon her friends for her support."</p>

<p>Madame de Jolibois, as she said this,
looked severely at Rose, of whom she distinctly 
disapproved. But Rose smiled so innocently
that Miss Kizzy was beguiled into
smiling back at her.</p>

<p>"Serena will continue to play the piano,"
she added, "and I shall of course teach
grace and deportment as heretofore, during
the enforced absence of Monshur d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys.
When he returns we will doubtless
make other arrangements."</p>

<p>She arose to take her leave. A half-smile
of recognition came into the rector's eyes;
he held out his hand and opened his lips to
speak; but the old lady drew back with a

<!-- page 130 -->

stiff Dancing-Academy "curchey" and went
away, followed by Jeffrey and Olive, who
walked with her to her own gate. There
she waved the young man aside, and drawing 
Olive to her she whispered tragically,
"He possesses the dangerous secret, Olive,
my child. I saw it in his visual orbs. I
fear there will be bloodshed."</p>

<p>The two young people walked back across
the common, laughing a little at Miss Kizzy's
delusions, then dropping into silence. The
girl seemed constrained and preoccupied,
and her companion, with beating heart, was
vainly trying to formulate some indifferent
remark concerning the new minister, when
she stopped abruptly. It was upon the spot&mdash;still
showing signs of the conflict in the
beaten grass and plowed soil&mdash;where, not
twenty-four hours earlier, her life had been
for a moment in deadly peril.</p>

<p>"I can see those horrible flaming eyes
yet," she said in an awed tone; "O Duncan,
how can I thank you! how can I ever
repay you!"</p>

<p>For all answer, he caught her hand, and a
torrent of words came struggling to his lips.</p>

<p>"Olive! Duncan!" called Rose in her
shrill sweet voice. He looked up. She was

<!-- page 131 -->

coming down the avenue of oaks to meet
them, accompanied by Mark Kennison.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>Thus was added, almost without the formality
of an introduction, a new element to
the intimate life of Roseneath.</p>

<p>The young clergyman, while instituting
energetic changes in his church,&mdash;changes
somewhat startling to his conservative congregation,&mdash;still
had leisure to enter with
zest into his novel and attractive surroundings.
Born in a colder climate and among
a more reserved people, Mark Kennison's
fervid and poetic temperament found something
curiously akin to itself in the rose-gardens
and orange-groves; the stately many-galleried
houses; the joyous open-air life
and warm responsiveness of this far-away
little Southern town.</p>

<p>"How did you happen to come so far
away from home, Mr. Kennison?" demanded
Rose one afternoon when the now
familiar quartette lingered together on the
front gallery, watching the brown patched
sails on a schooner creep down the river.</p>

<p>"So far away from home!" echoed Kennison
dreamily; "it was rather the return
of an exile!" His eyes as he spoke met

<!-- page 132 -->

those of Olive Herring turned curiously
toward him. A quick flush passed over his
swarthy cheek. "I came," he continued in
a conventional tone, "to accompany a sick
friend to San Antonio. On my homeward
journey I stopped in H&mdash;&mdash;, where I was
caught by the yellow-fever epidemic just
then breaking out. I had the fever myself,
and when the quarantine was raised, my
strength was too exhausted to permit me at
once to return to my duties. I therefore
resigned my former charge and returned to
San Antonio. There I received the call to
St. John's&mdash;where"&mdash; He paused, his
eyes wandering absently over the soft October
landscape.</p>

<p>"Where, may you wave forever!" concluded
Rose irreverently.</p>

<p>"Amen!" ejaculated Jeffrey in the same
tone, looking up from the Lamarque rose-vine
which with Liberty's help he was training
about one of the fluted pillars of the
veranda.</p>

<p>"How still the air is!" said Olive, rising
and strolling down the steps.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>"Sho's you bawn, Betty," Lib declared
that night at the usual hour for such confidences,

<!-- page 133 -->

"ef Mars Dunc don't hump his-se'f,
he's gwine ter lose de race!"</p>

<p>"Why'n't he hump his-se'f, den?" cried
Betty indignantly. "Ef Mars Dunc don't
keer enough fer Miss Olive ter head off dat
preacher-man, den let de preacher-man git
her. Dass de way wi' man-folks, anyhow.
So biggaty, dey think a gal is boun' fer ter
drop in dey mouth lak a briled partridge!
Lawd, ef Miss Olive has got de right sort o'
<i>spunk</i>, she's gwine ter hol' dat preacher-man
over Mars Dunc's haid lak I helt Jack Yates
over yo'n, ontell"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Shet up, gal, an' go to sleep," interrupted
Lib with a smothered chuckle. "I got to
'scort dem young folks up to Good Luck
to-morrow to see de sugar-bilin'."</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>The Herring carriage, drawn by its sleek
bays, and driven by Liberty in person,
stopped the next morning about ten o'clock
in front of the rambling plantation-house at
Good Luck. Mrs. Huddlestone, fat and
motherly, came bustling down the steps to
receive the visitors as they alighted.</p>

<p>"Lord, honey, how you've grown!" she
cried, bestowing a sounding kiss upon Olive's
cheek. "And I do declare you're the mortal

<!-- page 134 -->

spi't of your cousin, Elinor Thornham!
How's the Colonel? Well an' hearty?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Huddlestone dated back to the very
earliest days of Thornham. She had been
Major Billy Duncan's housekeeper at Good
Luck for more than thirty years, and continued
to perform that important service for
his grand-nephew.</p>

<p>"And bless my soul, Rose Drennon, if you
ain't got on long dresses! How's yo' paw,
honey? I ain't seen Rufe Drennon for a
coon's age!" Her tone, though still kindly,
became slightly patronizing as she addressed
the girl who belonged to her own class.
"You'll find Mr. Duncan over at the sugar-house,"
she went on, waddling across the
house-yard in front of the party, "onless
you come into the dinin'-room an' have
some buttermilk, first? It's just out o' the
churn. You don't keer for it? Well. Here,
Jupe, you lazy, good-for-nothing limb o'
Satan, run ahead an' open the gates for yo'
Miss Olive. Look out for them tie-vines,
honey." This last admonition was addressed
to Kennison, who stared and blushed a little
at the familiarity; but recovered himself
when he heard her say to the setter trotting
beside her, as she turned toward the house:

<!-- page 135 -->

"Now, Alamo, honey, ain't you ashamed
o' yo'self to be a-barkin' at Lib Thornham
like as if you hadn't never set eyes on
him afore!"</p>

<p>Jupe, coal-black, plump and ragged, raced
across the wide grassy lot, bursting with
vain-glory, and swung open the large gate
leading into a rose-hedged lane, beyond
which towered the great square red-brick
chimneys of the sugar-house. From these
a circling column of velvety-black smoke
wavered upward. Below stretched the
broad low expanse of the sugar-shed. High-wheeled
wagons drawn by sturdy sugar
mules were lumbering in, loaded with purplish-red
and golden-yellow cane; their grinning
drivers shouted and gesticulated at the
occupants of the empty carts clattering back
to the fields. A file of men alongside the
creeping "carrier" were feeding it steadily
from the huge pile of cane hard by. Clouds
of white steam blew out at intervals from
the engines whose regular pulses throbbed
noisily. A small mountain of <i>bagasse</i> arose
in the rear of the shed; over against it a
row of discarded sugar-kettles showed their
flaring sides, red with rust. The wholesome
smell of boiling cane-juice was everywhere.</p>

<!-- page 136 -->

<p>The young planter came across the busy
inclosure to greet his guests. His hat was
pushed back from his forehead and he was
in his shirt-sleeves. He excused himself for
not having been at the house to meet them
on their arrival.</p>

<p>"We were tinkering upon a piece of
broken shafting. Welcome to Good Luck,"
he said, shaking hands heartily with Kennison.
"It has been two years since you
were here," he continued, speaking to the
two girls, but looking at Olive. "I have
made a great many improvements since.
Will you go over the sugar-house, first?
Or shall we see the cane-cutting?"</p>

<p>"The cane-cutting first," decided Rose,
who was scampering about, heedless and
joyous as a young kitten.</p>

<p>Jeffrey gave some instructions to his manager,
then, drawing on his coat, he led the
way to the fields, which, blue-green and
billowy under the morning sun, made a
smiling background in every direction for
the central picture of noise and activity.</p>

<p>It was Kennison's first view of a sugar
plantation, and he looked about him with
keen interest.</p>

<p>The autumn day was perfect; the sky

<!-- page 137 -->

was absolutely cloudless, except where the
vapory smoke from the sugar-house chimneys
banked itself against the eastern horizon.
A soft breeze stirred the tall cane, which
moved with an incessant murmurous rustling.
The broad ditches intersecting the
fields were ablaze with ragged sunflowers
and wide-disked coreopsis; the grass, still
green underfoot, was sprinkled with coarse
purple daisies.</p>

<p>The smell of honeysuckle and roses intermixed
came in whiffs from the dooryards
of the Quarter, whose cabins stood in a
double row to the right of the open lane.
From "Indian-cut,"&mdash;so named from a
low mound marking its boundary&mdash;where
the cane-cutters were at work, a chorus,
monotonous, plaintive, weird, arose and
floated away to lose itself in the outlying
swamps. As Jeffrey and his friends drew
nearer the words were distinguishable:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="small">

<p>"Stan' right still, an' steady yo'se'f,</p>

<p class="center">Sinner!<br/>

Zoom-ba-loom-ba!</p>

<p>De Lawd gwine ter move dis Ark His-se'f,</p>

<p class="center">Sinner!<br/>

Zoom-ba-loom-ba!</p>

<p>Look to de eas' an' look to de wes',</p>

<p class="center">Sinner!<br/>

Zoom-ba-loom-ba!</p>

<!-- page 138 -->

<p>De saints o' de Lawd marchin' abreas',</p>

<p class="center">Zoom-ba-loom-ba!<br/>

Zoom!"</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>The song ceased abruptly, and the singers
greeted the master with a lusty shout. The
gang numbered about one hundred, of whom
nearly one half were women,&mdash;strong, stalwart,
and brawny,&mdash;their striped turbans
and blue skirts distinguishing them from
their male companions. The cutters moved
with swift rhythmic step among the cane;
the broad, keen-edged, hooked knives rose
and fell in unison, stripping the leaves,
and severing the stalks with unerring precision.</p>

<p>A bent and wrinkled old negro on horse
back, who was directing their movements,
rode forward and dismounted, baring his
gray head.</p>

<p>Jeffrey nodded pleasantly. "Well, Jerry,"
he said, "how is your gang working
to-day?"</p>

<P>"Pretty well, Mars Dunc, pretty well,
sah," returned the old man. "Injun-cut's
nigh erbout finished, sah." He pointed
with his whip, as he spoke, to the denuded
portion of the field, where the cane lay right
and left, alternately, across the furrows in

<!-- page 139 -->

symmetrical heaps, the stripped stalks glistening
in the sun.</P>

<p>"Very well, Uncle Jerry," commented
his master with a smile of approval, "come
up to the house to-night, and I'll see what
I can do for you."</p>

<p>Jerry ducked his head, snickering into
his hat. He felt in anticipation a finger of
Mars Dunc's mellow Bourbon slipping like
perfumed oil down his dry old throat.</p>

<p>He swung himself lightly into the saddle
and resumed his wonted air of severe disapproval.</p>

<p>The planter, walking back across the field,
explained to Kennison, excited and enthusiastic,
the methods of planting and cultivating
the cane.</p>

<p>"It is not without its compensations, life
on a sugar plantation," he concluded, "but
it is from year's end to year's end; it is a
constant financial risk, and it is monotonous."</p>

<p>"I should never tire of it," declared
Olive with conviction.</p>

<p>Duncan's heart gave a sudden leap, and his
eyes lighted as if the hope of a lifetime
were already realized. He could hardly
trust himself to look at her. When he did

<!-- page 140 -->

steal a glance in her direction, her calmly
unconscious face sobered him, and his momentary
elation died away.</p>

<p>Far behind them the chorus of the cane-cutters
again filled the air with its curious
meaningless refrain:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="small">

<p class="center">"Zoom-ba-loom-ba!<br/>

Zoom!"</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>After the noontide rest, spent in loitering
about the cabins and offices, they inspected
the sugar-making. It was in the
days of the open kettles; the ponderous and
wonderful machinery of the present time
had not yet been introduced, and the process
was more simple, more wasteful, and
more picturesque. When they had seen it
all, from the sickly, sweetish, green juice,
pouring from the crushers, to the great
vats of dark, slowly-cooling molasses, and
the moist heaps of yellow sugar,&mdash;shoveled
like golden sand from the clean floors and
thrown, spadeful by spadeful, into the waiting
barrels,&mdash;they came out and stood by
the carrier, watching its slow upward movement. 
The feeders were mostly negroes;
but there were two white men among them;
an old "poor-white," with a long lean patient

<!-- page 141 -->

face, who stooped painfully over his
work; and a young man whose black eyes
glowed dully beneath scowling brows. The
latter, whose name was Hogan, worked at
the upper end of the carrier. He stepped
to the ever-lessening, always-growing pile of
cane, and slowly pulled from it an armful of
stalks, staring boldly the while at the two
pretty young women. Turning to the man
who stood next him, he said something in
a low tone, lifting his load at the same time
to cast it into the carrier. As he did so he
stumbled, and the cane, missing its mark,
fell to the ground. Jeffrey, who had lingered
a moment in the sugar-house, had
come out unobserved; and as the man recovered
himself he sprang at him without a
word and dealt him a blow with his clenched
fist full upon the mouth. Hogan dropped
like a stone, but rose immediately, the blood
streaming from his face, and looked around
him with glaring eyeballs. When he recognized
his antagonist, however, he stooped,
muttering sullenly, and began to pick up the
scattered cane.</p>

<p>The negroes stopped work for a second,
and a smothered laugh of approval passed
along the line. Kennison looked pained and

<!-- page 142 -->

surprised; Rose drew timidly back; Olive's
eyes blazed with indignation.</p>

<p>Jeffrey wiped the blood from his hand
with his handkerchief. "Here comes Jupe
to say that dinner is waiting," he said in his
ordinary tone. "I hope that you all have a
country appetite."</p>

<p>Olive walked beside him in displeased
silence, her lips quivering and her cheeks
flushed.</p>

<p>"Was not that rather a severe punishment
for so trifling an offense as dropping
an armful of cane?" she demanded in a low
tone, when she could sufficiently command
her voice.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he answered good-humoredly,
though he winced a little. "But discipline
is necessarily severe on the plantation during 
sugar-making time."</p>

<p>The Good Luck plantation-house was a
wide-galleried one-story structure, which
"spraddled," as Mrs. Huddlestone said, "all
over creation." The late Major Duncan, who
had remained a bachelor all his life, had followed
his own whims in the matter of building,
undeterred by the mild remonstrances
of his housekeeper, constructing wings, adding
closets, throwing out porches, as their

<!-- page 143 -->

need became apparent. The result was
quaintly pleasing to the eye. There was a
certain bareness within; the large rooms,
containing only the necessary pieces of ponderous
old-fashioned furniture, lacked the
dainty touch of a woman's hand. This in
itself was a constant source of inward gratification
to the present owner. "It will be
Olive,"&mdash;he said it shyly to himself,&mdash;"it
will be Olive who will make the old place
look like home!"</p>

<p>The banks of the river, which made a long
outward curve in front of the plantation,
were lower here than at Thornham. The
windows of the dining-room looked directly
out upon La Salle Point, the place where
the famous French explorer was reputed to
have made his crossing on that last fatal journey
in search of the Chevalier Tonti, which
ended in his death. Through the noble
trees which studded the park, glimpses of
the yellow water could be seen. On the further
side, a bit of unbroken forest stretched
away to the horizon.</p>

<p>"Dinner's ready," announced Mrs. Huddlestone,
appearing on the gallery where the
party was enjoying this view. "You set at
the head of the table, honey," she whispered

<!-- page 144 -->

to Olive, "an' keep yo' eye on them keerless
dinin'-room boys. Lib Thornham's in the
pantry, an' I'm goin' to stay in the kitchen.
Lord, I hope young Mr. Duncan will be satisfied!"</p>

<p>There was no ground for complaint. The
late William Duncan, variously known as
"Major" and "Uncle Billy" Duncan, had
been a notoriously good liver, and he had
left behind him a cook who had been for
years the envy of his neighbors.</p>

<p>The behavior of "the boys," a couple of
sedate middle-aged men, under Liberty's
severe supervision, was admirable; nothing
was lacking in the appointment of the table
with its handsome hereditary service of silver
and glass. Yet&mdash;the dinner was not a
success.</p>

<p>The master of Good Luck, who had been
planning and arranging for weeks, and who
had looked forward with almost feverish
impatience to seeing Olive Herring at the
head of his own dinner-table, confessed to
himself with a sinking heart that things
somehow had gone wrong. A constraint
was upon them all. Kennison indeed talked,
but the heartiness of his tone was gone;
Olive was cold and unresponsive; even

<!-- page 145 -->

Rose, looking with questioning eyes from
one to another, was silent.</p>

<p>It was a relief when they rose at last from
the table. Almost immediately the carriage
appeared at the door, for the afternoon
shadows were beginning to fall.</p>

<p>"Come again soon, honey," Mrs. Huddlestone
called from the head of the steps.
Jeffrey, leaning against the wheel, longed
but did not dare to echo her invitation. He
looked somewhat wistfully at them all.</p>

<p>"I shall not be able to be much at Roseneath
until the grinding is over," he said,
stepping back after the adieux were said.</p>

<p>The carriage rolled away. He watched it
until a turn in the road hid it from sight.
The smile that curved his lips was tinged
with bitterness. But his voice was cheery
enough as he called up to his housekeeper,
lifting his hat, "Thank you, Mrs. Huddlestone!
The dinner would have delighted
Uncle Billy himself."</p>

<p>He walked rapidly to the sugar-house,
where the night-torches were already flaring;
the smoke from the huge chimney was starred
with red sparks; the engines pounded ceaselessly;
the figures moving about in the purple
gloom, carrying lanterns, had a ghostly

<!-- page 146 -->

look; in the little upper room where the
chemist tested the "takes," a greenish light
glittered like a planet; the feeders along
the carrier were droning a mournful hymn.</p>

<p>At the gate leading into the inclosure,
Jeffrey encountered the man, Hogan. He
stopped and regarded him for a moment
with lips compressed and fingers itching.</p>

<p>"You scoundrel! you&mdash;you cowardly
hound!" he said when he could speak.
"How dare you show yourself to me!
Leave this place instantly; and if I ever
catch you on my premises again, I will break
every bone in your body!"</p>

<p>Before he had finished speaking, Hogan
had slunk away.</p>

<p>This is what Jeffrey had overheard earlier
in the day when he came up unseen behind
the man:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Hmp!</i> Van Herrin's pretty gal looks
stuck up, don't she! Wonder ef she's a
thieft lak her daddy!"</p>

<p>VIII.</p>

<p class="small">TWO CAMPAIGNS.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> winter was the gayest known in
Thornham since its brief reign as the capital
of an infant republic. Roseneath, whose
chatelaine for the second time in the history
of the manor-house was a beautiful and
charming young woman, continued to be, as
in times past, the focus whence radiated all
social animation. Herring, apparently absorbed
in his public duties, and busied with
money speculations, yet appeared to note
with ever-increasing pride the success of the
joyous young creature who might be said to
redeem all his own past. He spared no
pains to add to her pleasures or her triumphs.
There were no more quiet expeditions
to Good Luck plantation, where the
grinding of an enormous crop went on uninterruptedly;
but there was a succession
of plantation parties at Fair View,&mdash;parties
which brought together people from
all quarters of the country, and which

<!-- page 148 -->

were veritable fairy-tales of mirth and extravagance.</p>

<p>Jeffrey&mdash;the press of the sugar-making
over&mdash;took his wonted place as leader in
this gay circle, the momentary constraint
which followed his unexplained and apparently
unjustifiable assault on the man Hogan
quite forgotten by his friends at Roseneath.</p>

<p>Kennison's advent, too, had awakened a
lively, and, truth to tell, half-puzzled interest
throughout the little town. His magnetism
in the pulpit swept his listeners with
enthusiasm with ritualistic changes and exterior
reforms, which in cooler moments they
did not sanction; his free association with
what Miss Kizzy called the Realm of Fashion
was sharply criticised and denounced
by the older members of St. John's; but
even these melted into smiling approval before
his winning and sympathetic personality.</p>

<p>"I wish my Maker may strike me stone
dead ef the parson ain't a plum out-'n-out
gentleman," was June Badgett's verdict.
For Kennison, doubly interested in this
group of men, as souls oftentimes awry,
and as types hitherto unknown to his experience,
often stopped under the Man-Fig and
talked familiarly with the Council.</p>

<!-- page 149 -->

<p>To Vanborough Herring, whose scholarly
instincts in rare moments asserted themselves
before the lettered young divine and
met with quick and tactful response, he
stood nearer than any man&mdash;except perhaps
Duncan Jeffrey&mdash;had stood for many
years.</p>

<p>The rush went bravely on. In the midst
of it Herring announced himself as a candidate
for the United States Congress. His
election was a foregone conclusion; nevertheless
the campaign, which was a vigorous
one, necessitated frequent absences from
home, and a breathless coming and going
of party leaders and political subalterns.</p>

<p>Almost at the moment of this announcement,
the small world of Thornham awoke,
electrified, to the fact that another, and to
the isolated and self-centred community a
far more important campaign was in progress
in their midst. The dullest eye in the
village could be no longer blind to the certainty
that the Rector of St. John's and the
master of Good Luck plantation were open
and determined, though friendly rivals for
the favor of Olive Herring.</p>

<p>Public sentiment was divided between the
two suitors. There was scarcely a man or

<!-- page 150 -->

woman in the county who had not known
and loved Duncan Jeffrey from his freckle-faced
and awkward, but always honest and
loyal boyhood, to the present moment. But
the glamour of romance was on the side of
the stranger.</p>

<p>"Of course she will marry Duncan!" said
Madame de Jolibois confidently; "she would
not be so foolish as to&mdash; Why, he toted her
when she was a baby, and made mud-pies
for her, when"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fiddlesticks, Keziah," interrupted Mrs.
Alsbury, who was arguing the case with her.
"Olive Herring is just as wise and no wiser
than other girls. She'll marry the preacher's
dark eyes, and you'll live to see it."</p>

<p>"Vanborough Herring's daughter?" said
an eminent statesman&mdash;a keen, subtle, observant
man of the world&mdash;who had spent
some days at Fair View in conference with
the congressional candidate. "She is simply
<i>living</i>. Every fibre of her beautiful young
body is alive; every sense is alert. But she
has, as yet, learned neither to feel nor to
think. When that time comes, the man
who wins her will indeed be a fortunate
one!"</p>

<p>The object of this solicitous interest meanwhile

<!-- page 151 -->

maintained an unconscious girlish dignity
which made any allusion to the subject
impossible in her presence. Liberty and
Betty continued to discuss it hotly in the
privacy of their own cabin.</p>

<p>"Why'n't Mars Dunc hump his-se'f!"
Betty would cry wrathfully. "Is he gwine
ter give dat preacher-man a walk-over?"</p>

<p>And Liberty, from the book of his own
experience, would reply, "Lawd, gal, Mars
Dunc neenter fret. He kin come in on de
home-stretch. <i>He ain' ham-strenk yit</i>, bless
Gawd!"</p>

<p>Thus the two campaigns went on side by
side, the air fairly throbbing with anticipation
and excitement. The conclusion of the
political contest in Herring's triumphant
elevation to the coveted seat at Washington
was inevitable.</p>

<p>But the result of the sentimental tourney
remained doubtful.</p>

<hr/>

<p>IX.</p>

<p class="small">THE PALM-TREE GIRL.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Where</span> is Liberty, Maum Betty?"
asked Miss Herring one afternoon, putting
her head in at the summer-house door.</p>

<p>Betty looked up from the bench where
she was sitting with a heaped-up tray of violets
on her lap.</p>

<p>"Lib?"&mdash;she stopped to chuckle softly
to herself,&mdash;"dat fool nigger, Miss Olive,
has gone to 'Mancipation."</p>

<p>"Sure enough, this is Emancipation Day!
I had forgotten. That is why the place is
so quiet. Why did you not go yourself,
Maum?"</p>

<p>"Who, me? Lawd, chile, does you think
I ain' got nothin' to do but to go trailin'
a'ter 'Mancipation? Ez fer Lib, he's dat
narrer-minded dat he ain' 'shame to caper
off de minit Mars Van gin him leave. Gawd
knows what debblement dem free-niggers is
up to out yander at 'Mancipation!"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Maum!</i>" the tall girl sank on her

<!-- page 153 -->

knees beside her old nurse and caressed her
shriveled hands coaxingly, "you want to
go, I am sure you do! And you have been
promising to take me ever since 'freedom.'
Cannot we go to-day? Rose and I? And
Duncan? Please, Maum Betty!"</p>

<p>Betty's eyes brightened, but she turned
her head away with an affectation of reluctance.
"Lawd, honey, what intrus has a
grown-up young lady like you got in dem
free-niggers! . . . But ef you is sot on it!
. . . Dey ain' no mo' 'count dan a passel
o' kerkle-burs! . . . 'Sides, I got to fix
yo' vi'let-water. But ef Mars Dunc'll go
'long"&mdash;</p>

<p>By this time she was urging her objections
upon empty air, for Olive had sped
across the rose-garden, crying with the eagerness
of a child, "Rose! Rose! come!"</p>

<p>Half an hour later the two girls came out
of the house accompanied by Jeffrey, and
followed at a respectful distance by Betty,
in a monstrous gala-day turban, her best
bombazine gown, and white kerchief. At
the foot of the steps they encountered Kennison,
who turned back with them, delighted
at the opportunity of witnessing the famous
celebration of Emancipation Day.</p>

<!-- page 154 -->

<p>[It may be explained, in passing, that the
negroes in the Southern States celebrate the
day upon which the proclamation reached
them, and not the day upon which it was
promulgated. Hence the date differs according
to their nearness or remoteness
from the seat of government.]</p>

<p>Their way led them directly past the
Jolibois Dancing-Academy. The sound of
shuffling feet within and the tinkle of the
piano indicated that the Saturday afternoon
class (an innovation by Sarah Hunter) was
in training.</p>

<p>Olive left her companions at the gate
and ran in. Madame de Jolibois sat on
the high-backed sofa, with a red rose in her
hair, glaring at her assistant. Sarah Hunter
was hopelessly entangled with her young
charges in the intricate "hands-all-around"
of the Lancers. It took the visitor but a
moment to unravel the chain.</p>

<p>"I only came in to see how you are getting
on, Miss Kizzy. We are going to the
Emancipation picnic," she explained, "Rose
and Duncan and I&mdash;and Mr. Kennison."</p>

<p>Madame de Jolibois smiled affectionately
up at her young friend. "Duncan Jeffrey,"
she remarked irrelevantly, "is the most cultivated

<!-- page 155 -->

young gentleman in Thornham, by
far. I am sure that Monshur d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys,
when he returns, will approve of Duncan
Jeffrey. Mr. Kennison is also highly
proper," she added, with some haste. "I
am satisfied, Olive,"&mdash;her voice sank to a
whisper, though Miss Serena's monotonous
thumping and Sarah Hunter's loud commands
made such a precaution unnecessary,&mdash;"I
am satisfied that he has never divulged
the dangerous secret. It is well. Monshur
d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys is a husband. And there
would have been bloodshed."</p>

<p>Newall, from the open window of his
office, saw them approaching, and came out
to meet them. Time had borne heavily
upon the lawyer; his friends often wondered
why; for the income from his profession
more than sufficed for his simple
needs, and he had no other cares. He
walked with his head down and his hands
behind his back, like an old man. He was
quite bald. His clothes, as usual, were well-worn
and shabby. The curiously sad look
in his eyes seemed out of keeping with his
large features and bulky figure.</p>

<p>He held Olive's hand between his own
while he chatted pleasantly with them; and

<!-- page 156 -->

he looked lingeringly after her as she moved
away with Kennison at her side, Jeffrey and
Rose walking together behind them.</p>

<p>"How like she is to Elinor Thornham,"
he muttered; "the same proud, yet sweet
look; the same smile, the very same smile!
Keep to the rear, Duncan, my boy," he
added bitterly, "she is not for you. It is
the stranger who wins now&mdash;as then."</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>The place chosen by the negroes for their
annual gathering was about a mile distant
from the straggling suburbs of the village.
The level stretch of ground from which the
undergrowth had been cleared away was
shaded by vast live-oaks whose green was
intermixed with the dusty-gray of downward-sweeping
Spanish moss. There was a
rude attempt at decoration above the grove;
flags and streamers fluttered from poles
planted in the open spaces; ropes of evergreen
hung dangling between them. Near
the centre of the grounds a rough platform
had been erected, and scattered about under
the trees were numberless little tables
loaded with food and presided over by
high-turbaned dames, famous in the annals
of the county for their skill in cookery. A

<!-- page 157 -->

well-trodden and dusty plot in the rear was
reserved for dancing. This place, however,
as well as the quarter laid off for foot-races,
ball-playing, and other sports, was for the
moment deserted; and the large assemblage,
as the party from Roseneath drew
near, was pressing toward the raised platform.</p>

<p>Here, upon a huge split-bottomed chair
ornamented with streamers of red, white,
and blue calico, which stood on the dais,
sat Uncle Isham Lester. His hands rested
on his knees; his body was rigidly erect;
his eyes were half-closed; his lips were compressed.</p>

<p>Uncle Isham was the "Centre Figger."</p>

<p>"The Centre Figger," Olive explained
in a whisper to Kennison, "is the man or
woman chosen each year by the negro community
to preside over Emancipation Day.
It is a great honor."</p>

<p>They had stationed themselves in the
shade of a tree a little to the right of the
dais, whence they could observe the proceedings.
Liberty and Big Hannah greeted
them, grinning, from the crowd; and Betty's
younger children plunged toward her
uproariously, butting a path for themselves

<!-- page 158 -->

through the swaying remonstrating throng,
with their woolly heads.</p>

<p>"De Centre Figger is gwine to norate,"
announced Jack Yates, the sleek brown
Baptist preacher, in a pompous tone from
the steps of the platform. "De Daughters
of Rebecca will percede de noration by
singin' de Hymn o' Freedom. De conjugation
will jine in de chorus."</p>

<p>The Daughters of Rebecca, a band of
black but comely damsels in a grotesque
uniform of blue and white paper-cambric,
who were ranged behind the split-bottomed
throne, broke into a wild chant as Uncle
Isham rose and stepped forward:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"The Angull Gab'l he up an' axed de Lawd,<br/>

'Lawd, why'n't you set dem colored people free?'<br/>

And de Lawd he anserd, 'I'm bidin' my time<br/>

Ter set my people free!<br/>

Free! Free!<br/>

Bidin' my time<br/>

Ter set my people free!' "</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The immense crowd took up the chorus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Free! Free!<br/>

Bidin' my time<br/>

Ter set my people free!"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The drowsy summer air fairly thrilled
with the volume of sound. There were
those in the motley multitude&mdash;old men

<!-- page 159 -->

and women with scarred brows, whose
backs had smarted under the lash&mdash;who
sang the anthem with solemn fervor, the
tears streaming down their black faces; the
younger ones sang it exultantly, insolently,
clapping their hands and swinging their
bodies to its rhythm; the children with their
piping voices echoed the refrain. Louder
and louder it rose; faster and faster; the
excited mass began to surge and roar like a
storm-swollen sea; a subtle and penetrating
odor pervaded the atmosphere. Blood-shot
eyeballs rolled in the direction of the white
faces turned almost awestruck upon them;
a Berserker rage was rising, blind, unreasoning,
resistless!</p>

<p>Jeffrey, signaling to Liberty for assistance
in case it was needed, was on the point
of hurrying his companions away, when
Uncle Isham lifted his hand. The tumultuous
throng fell into instant silence.</p>

<p>The old man stood for a moment looking
quietly but masterfully down upon the mass
of faces uplifted to his own. He was very
black, though his features had none of the
grotesqueness of the typical negro face; his
large nose was straight, his lips curiously
thin. His forehead was branded with tattoo

<!-- page 160 -->

marks; these hieroglyphs also circled
his bare arms, and were traced diagonally
across his naked breast,&mdash;the sign of his
royal birth. For Uncle Isham was an African
prince. One of those nameless inward-stealing
vessels which plied between the
coast of Guinea and Thornham in its early
days had set him ashore at midnight in the
canebrake with several hundred others of
his color. He was then in the strength and
vigor of young manhood; now his head was
snow-white, and his once tall and commanding
form was shrunken with age. But his
dark eyes glowed fiercely beneath their overhanging
brows. There was something about
him, even under the threatening whip of the
overseer, which inspired fear and respect.
"Me slave outside," he sometimes said,
drawing himself up with truly royal dignity,
"inside, me king."</p>

<p>He began to speak slowly and as if measuring
each word. Reduced to plain English,
from his uncouth but musical patois,
his brief speech ran somewhat after this
fashion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My friends, I am an old man and I
cannot talk much. You have made me the
Centre Figger, and you have done well.

<!-- page 161 -->

For you have been once slaves and you celebrate
your freedom. But I have been twice
a slave, I who am the son of a king. I,
who would have been a king myself, I have
been a slave to white people in this country
who have been kind to me; and I have been
a slave in my own country to black people
who lashed my back with leather thongs. I
was a prince. I lived in a great-house. I
also had slaves who were as the dust under
my feet. Do you think white men were the
only people who had slaves? There was a
wall around the king's great-house, and beyond
there was a grove of palm-trees. Do
you want to know how I became a slave?
I will tell you. It is the first time that I
have told it. There was a hut in the grove
of palms. And a girl, who had brown eyes
and a soft skin, came out of the hut. I
saw her over the wall; and though the king,
my father, had forbidden the gate to be
opened, I opened it and went down to where
the girl stood under the palms. Not once,
but many times. And there, at last, I was
seized and carried into the country of my
father's enemy. And I was dust under his
foot. For many years I served in his field,
until the white man bought me from him,

<!-- page 162 -->

and fetched me across the big water to be
the dust under his foot. Now, I am twice
free, and I live in a land where there are
no slaves. But something in a man dies
hard."</p>

<p>He paused, and his uplifted arm fell to
his side. When he spoke again, it was in
a low dreamy tone; a strange light softened
his sunken eyes.</p>

<p>"I have a wife," he said. "She is a
good woman. She has made me a father
seven times. She has planted the gourd-vine
in my dooryard and kept my hearth
bright. But I would be slave again to the
white man who has been kind to me, and
slave again to the black man who lashed
the blood from my back with a leather
thong; I would be chained like a dog in
the dark place of the ship, burnt with fever
and parched with thirst. For what? do
you ask me? For a sight of the blue sky
of my country? But I tell you, no. To sit
beside the king, my father, on his gold-fringed
mat? But I tell you, no! Twice
am I free, but twice would I be a slave again
to look once more in the eyes of the girl
who waited for me under the palm-tree!"</p>

<p>This unexpected climax confused and bewildered

<!-- page 163 -->

his listeners; they gazed at each
other in open-mouthed amazement. The
prince had seated himself in his chair and
resumed his impassive attitude. An aged
negress came up out of the throng and stood
beside him with her hand on his shoulder,
looking down at the sea of faces with
proudly defiant eyes.</p>

<p>It was his wife.</p>

<p>She opened her lips as if to speak; but
the Reverend Jack Yates, recovering from
his momentary stupefaction, motioned to the
Daughters of Rebecca, and again the triumphant
chorus swelled forth:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Free! Free!<br/>

I'm bidin' my time<br/>

Ter set my people free."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"Let us go," said Jeffrey to his friends,
and they slipped away unobserved. Liberty,
working his way through the press,
reached them as they entered the tangled
glade stretching away to the edge of the
town. He looked a little shamefaced as he
dropped behind with Betty and the children.
Big Hannah, being President of the
Sisters of Deborah, had remained with that
uniformed, be-streamered, and be-badged
association.</p>

<!-- page 164 -->

<p>"Well, Lib," said Betty quizzically, "has
you got nuff o' dat free-nigger foolishness?
Ef I was Unk' Is'om Lester's wife"&mdash;</p>

<p>"But you ain', honey!" cried Liberty,
recovering his accustomed jauntiness, "you
ain'. You my wife, an' my pa'm-tree gal
besides; an' de onlies' woman dat I ever
shined my eyes on."</p>

<p>The young people walked rather silently
along the rutty wagon-road which threaded
its way between the over-arching trees.
Once or twice Kennison stopped to pick a
wild-flower, or a bit of fern; the others
gazed at him as he did so with abstracted
and dreamy eyes, hearing inwardly the
echoes of Uncle Isham's love-story.</p>

<p>When they reached the outer park-gate
of Roseneath, Rose stopped.</p>

<p>"I must go home," she said; "I cannot
come in."</p>

<p>"Why, Rose!" remonstrated Olive.</p>

<p>"I promised my father that I would be
there to-night. I have not seen him for a
week. I must go," Rose continued with a
little break in her voice, which showed how
great was the sacrifice.</p>

<p>Olive did not urge her. For, ease-loving
and shallow as the girl undoubtedly was,

<!-- page 165 -->

she was stoutly loyal to her uncouth, slouching,
idle father.</p>

<p>"I will come back Monday afternoon,"
she said, looking at them all as she turned
to go. Her eyes had a new wistfulness in
them; something like a dawning soul looked
out of their blue depths.</p>

<p>Duncan had a momentary struggle with
himself; then he stepped forward. "I will
go with you, Rose," he said. "It is too
late for you to go alone." She smiled
gratefully, and they turned down the road
in the direction of Drennon's cabin.</p>

<p>The low sun threw a soft glow over the
rose-garden. Kennison passed with Olive
along one of the lavender-bordered walks,
and drew her without speaking into the old
summer-house. Liberty and the children
disappeared around a corner of the gallery,
but Betty seated herself with a discontented
air on the steps.</p>

<p>"Lawd," she muttered, with her chin in
her hand and her scowling gaze fixed upon
the summer-house. "Why'n't Mars Dunc
stay here an' min' his own business, stidder
takin' dat gal Rose home. I seen a look in
de preacher-man's eyes whilse Unk' Is'om
was noratin' 'bout dat pa'm-tree gal, an'

<!-- page 166 -->

sho's you bawn he's co'tin' Miss Olive
yander in de summer-house dis minit."</p>

<p>Betty's instincts, and her knowledge of
man in his kind, had not deceived her.</p>

<p>"Miss Herring&mdash;Olive!" Kennison was
saying in a voice shaken by emotion, "do
I need to tell you that I love you? That I
have looked over the wall of my every-day
existence and seen you standing under the
palm-trees of love! May I open the gate
and come to you? Will you give me the
love which I crave, Olive? Will you be
my wife?"</p>

<p>It was but a half-whispered word which
he bent to hear. But it was enough. She
hid her agitated face on his shoulder, yielding
as loyally to his caress as she had
proudly withheld even from herself any
admission of her love until openly wooed.</p>

<p>Nearly an hour passed in the first rapturous
interchange of confidence, and mutual
confession. Kennison at last arose, reluctantly,
to go.</p>

<p>"To-morrow is Sunday," he said, "and I
have still a part of my sermon to prepare.
I may speak to your father soon, may I not?
It will seem an eternity until I see you
again!"</p>

<!-- page 167 -->

<p>He came back from the gate to assure
himself once more, as he laughingly said,
that he had not been dreaming, and then
ran, with a light and boyish step, down the
road toward the town.</p>

<p>He was scarcely out of sight, and Olive
still sat in the summer-house, where the
gray twilight shadows were gathering, when
Jeffrey opened the gate.</p>

<p>At sight of him Betty shook her head
mournfully. "De winnin' hoss has done
gone under de rope, Mars Dunc! You is
too late!" she groaned beneath her breath,
waving him silently to the summer-house.</p>

<p>He walked with a determined step across
the rose-garden.</p>

<p>"Olive," he began abruptly, standing
before her with bared head, "I love you. I
have loved you ever since you were a baby.
Will you marry me?"</p>

<p>His wooing was rude enough in contrast
with Kennison's poetic and impassioned ap
peal. But it moved the girl strangely. A
storm of conflicting emotions swept suddenly 
over her.</p>

<p>"O Duncan!" she cried, springing up
and putting out an entreating hand. Her
face was pale, and her dark eyes looked
troubled in the wan light.</p>

<!-- page 168 -->

<p>He caught her hand and pressed it with
both his own against his breast.</p>

<p>"I am but a common-place fellow, Olive;
I know that I do not deserve such happiness;
but I would give my life for you. I
will try to be worthy of you. I will study
your wishes, I will"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't, Duncan," she pleaded imploringly,
"I"&mdash;</p>

<p>The eager flush faded from his cheek.</p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;is it Kennison?" he asked slowly.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, trying to steady her
voice, "I am going to marry Mr. Kennison."</p>

<p>Duncan loosed the hand he still held, then
he caught it again in a firm clasp.</p>

<p>"He is a noble fellow, and far more worthy
of you than I could ever be. God bless
you, Olive; I know you will be happy!"</p>

<p>He lifted her hand to his lips, touched
with reverent fingers her bowed head, and
was gone.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>Kennison's thoughts, as he bounded along
the dusty road, were of so joyous a nature
that he could hardly refrain from shouting
them aloud for all the world to hear; already
they had leaped forward with a daring which

<!-- page 169 -->

a few hours earlier he would have deemed
preposterous; for he could not but realize
that his rival&mdash;his equal in all other respects&mdash;was,
from a worldly point of view,
far better suited than himself to the future
heiress of Roseneath. Now! he lifted his
eyes to the distant spire of St. John's
Church, touched with the last pale-gold of
the evening light, and his heart beat exultantly
at the inward vision which swam before
them; he saw himself waiting at the altar,
while up the aisle came to him, with down-dropped
eyes, and fair face, shining like a
star through the mist of her veil, his bride.
<i>His bride!</i> He murmured the words aloud,
in a sort of rapture.</p>

<p>Suddenly he slackened his pace, and tried
to shake himself into soberness; for some
one was approaching him in the falling
dusk. As he drew nearer, he recognized the
squat figure and red puffy face of June
Badgett.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Badgett?" he inquired
heartily, stopping to shake hands.</p>

<p>"Wa-al," drawled June, "I ain't over an'
above well, parson. Ef I had my druthers,
I'd be in bed; but I promised Mis' Alsbury,
day before yistiddy, that I'd fetch her some

<!-- page 170 -->

mint-'n'-tansy; an' I reckin she's in a swivet
to git it before supper."</p>

<p>He laughed lazily, shifting the basket of
herbs from one arm to the other.</p>

<p>"You have not been to church for a long
time, Badgett,"&mdash;Kennison vainly tried to
throw some severity into his voice.</p>

<p>"Lord, parson, I can't do everything an'
go to mill, too," cried June. " 'Pears like
some folks kin,&mdash;'specially ef they start out
by stealin' di'mon's." He pointed his elbow
significantly, as he spoke, at Herring, who
flashed by in a light buggy drawn by a pair
of superb horses.</p>

<p>"Eh? What did you say, Badgett?"
asked Kennison abstractedly, gazing after
the turnout, and wondering how this proud
and reticent man would like for his daughter
to marry a penniless and obscure preacher.</p>

<p>The change in his tone which showed his
thoughts to be with the rich man and not
upon himself, Badgett, stirred the usually
good-natured loafer to anger.</p>

<p>"I said," he repeated, raising his voice,
"that folks that kin git their start by stealin'
di'mon's kin efford to drive fine hosses,
an' go to Congress, an' set at a table loden
with gold, an' silver, an' champagne."</p>

<!-- page 171 -->

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Kennison,
staring at him blankly.</p>

<p>"I mean what I say," replied Badgett,
doggedly; "I mean that Van Herrin' yonder
is a thief, an' a double thief, for he stole
di'mon's from a dead woman. You ain't
never heerd that tale, parson? Then ax the
first man you run acrost; fer ever' man, woman
an' chile in Thornham knows that Van
Herrin' was ez poor ez I am, ontell the night
he sneaked out'n Roseneath yander with
Miss Elinor Thornham's di'mon's under his
arm. An' I wish my Maker would strike
me stone dead ef I didn't see him with my
own eyes."</p>

<p>"You had better go home, Badgett," said
Kennison, seizing him by the collar and
looking sternly in his face. "You have been
drinking."</p>

<p>"Drinkin'!" echoed Badgett, angrily,
shaking himself loose. "Let go o' me, d&mdash;n
you! You're a plum out-'n'-out gentleman,
parson," he added with sullen humility,
"but you're liable to mistakes. Ax the
first man you run acrost about Van Herrin',
an' Miss Elinor's di'mon's."</p>

<p>He walked away, leaving his antagonist
rooted where he stood and speechless with
anger.</p>

<!-- page 172 -->

<p>Kennison's brain was in a whirl. What
did it mean? Did it mean anything?</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" he ejaculated with a laugh,
resuming his walk, "the envious froth of a
foolish man's tongue!" But his exhilaration
was gone. Strive as he would he could not
recall that image of his bride in her white
and virgin loveliness. Badgett's words returned
with teasing insistence; and certain
half-uttered phrases, heretofore meaningless,
began to shape themselves, unconsciously,
into clearness in his troubled brain.</p>

<p>"Ax the first man you run acrost;" he
repeated Badgett's words monotonously. "I
will not!" he replied to himself angrily.
"I will," he finally exclaimed. "At least
I will see what the idle report means."</p>

<p>He quickened his steps again until he
reached the business portion of the street.
Here he looked about him uncertainly; then
perceiving a light in an upper room of one
of the weather-beaten houses, he ran up the
outer stair, that climbed shakily to the second
floor, and tapped on the door. It was
opened by Andrew Barclay of the firm of
Barclay and Wright, an elderly man, a lawyer,
and one of his own parishioners.</p>

<p>"Why, good-evening, Mr. Kennison," he

<!-- page 173 -->

said cordially. "Come in, come in. I am
glad to see you."</p>

<p>Kennison suddenly appeared ridiculous in
his own eyes.</p>

<p>"I only stopped," he stammered, "to
speak to you about the matter of repairs at
the church&mdash; I beg your pardon, Mr. Barclay,"
he continued with an abrupt change
of manner, and a return to his usual quiet
dignity, "I came for personal reasons. Will
you allow me a few moments' talk?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," responded Mr. Barclay, closing
the door and leading the way into his
inner office, where he placed a chair for his
visitor, and seated himself.</p>

<p>Again Kennison drew back. A quick
sense of his own treachery to his friend and
to his betrothed swept over him. But he
steadied himself and leaned forward.</p>

<p>"Mr. Barclay," he began, "I have to-day
for the first time heard a very serious charge&mdash;a
charge of theft&mdash;brought against one
of my friends and parishioners. The source
from which this information reached me is a
very doubtful one. But I feel justified in
investigating its truth. I refer to the report
that Colonel Herring&mdash; For reasons
personal to myself, I desire to hear the story&mdash;which

<!-- page 174 -->

I am confident is false, or grossly
exaggerated&mdash;from some responsible person.
Will you give me the facts in the case?"</p>

<p>Mr. Barclay got up from his chair, sat
down again, and coughed aimlessly once or
twice.</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Kennison," he said, "I
hardly know how to reply. There was certainly
a curious robbery here in Thornham
some twelve or thirteen years ago; and circumstances
at the time seemed to implicate
Van&mdash;Colonel Herring. But"&mdash;</p>

<p>"You will oblige me by relating the affair
just as it happened," interrupted Kennison
in a tone of authority.</p>

<p>Andrew Barclay was a conscientious man;
he prided himself on his straightforwardness,
and on the entire absence of prejudice
in his profession. But his profession had also
cultivated a certain dramatic talent which
he possessed; and although he began Vanborough
Herring's story with the intention
of giving simply an unbiased statement,
yet as he proceeded, his own secret conviction
that there was something rotten at the
core of the successful man's life tinged his
words. He related the details of Elinor
Thornham's death as if he had been present;

<!-- page 175 -->

almost unconsciously he added as facts the
later exaggerations that had crept into the
story; his sonorous voice rose and fell with
cadenced emphasis; he felt himself thrilled
with his own eloquence as he described the
tragic death of Young Van, and the sudden
snatching away of the wife and two children.</p>

<p>"The Hand of God sometimes delays,"
he concluded, "but it is heavy when it does
strike."</p>

<p>His auditor, who had sat motionless
through the long recital, rose as if jerked
upward by a spring.</p>

<p>"I am very much obliged to you, Mr. Barclay,"
he said in a heavy monotonous voice.
"One question, if you please. Why was
Colonel Herring never prosecuted?"</p>

<p>"Oh," returned the lawyer with a shrug
of his shoulders, "family pride. The Thornhams
themselves would have been disgraced
if a kinsman of their own had gone to the
penitentiary."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Barclay," Kennison said
again; "good-evening."</p>

<p>Barclay listened with a bewildered air to
the echo of his retreating footsteps on the
stair outside. Suddenly he dashed his hand
to his forehead with a groan.</p>

<!-- page 176 -->

<p>"Oh, Lord, what have I done!" he cried.
"What an old ass I am. I had forgotten!
They say he is to marry Olive Herring.
Poor little Olive! Kennison!" he shouted,
springing precipitately to the door; "Mr.
Kennison!" he called again, possessed by a
wild desire to take it all back, somehow.
But the stairway, which was now quite dark,
was empty.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>The young preacher entered his study,
hardly knowing how he got there, and lighted
his student-lamp. His nearly finished sermon
lay on the table; he glanced at it indifferently,
and at the loose sheet beside it, upon
which he had that morning written some
verses dedicated to Olive Herring. He
picked up the latter and mechanically corrected
an error; then dropping it, he began
to walk restlessly up and down the small
room.</p>

<p>"A common thief!" he ejaculated, flushing
and paling by turns. "No, not a common
thief, by heaven! A rich, successful,
ambitious thief. . . . It is incredible, I
will not believe it! . . . And yet, is there
room for doubt? Barclay certainly believes
him guilty. . . . <i>Olive</i>, the daughter of a

<!-- page 177 -->

man publicly branded as a coward and a
criminal! It cannot, cannot be! . . . But
. . . dare I, have I the right to marry a
woman upon whose family rests even such
a suspicion? Do I not owe something to
my calling? . . . A taint in the blood of
<i>my wife!</i> . . . A stain upon <i>my wife's</i>
name! . . . O Olive! . . . Olive! . . . <i>My
God!</i>" he groaned aloud, and falling upon
his knees he strove to pray; but the words
which rose to his lips had no meaning.</p>

<p>The night wore away in a conflict between
what he believed to be love and duty. When
he appeared before his congregation the next
morning, his extreme pallor startled those
nearest him. To Olive, who stole a glance
at him as he entered, this was but the visible
trace of the same emotion which had kept
her awake the livelong night; and her heart
throbbed with secret exultation. No one
else suspected its cause; for neither June
Badgett nor Andrew Barclay was present.</p>

<p>The voice with which Kennison began his
sermon was weak and husky. He had no
notes before him, for it was not the sermon
which he had nearly finished the day before,
and which still lay, untouched, on the study-table.
He chose for his text the words:

<!-- page 178 -->

"<i>But God is faithful, who will not suffer
you to be tempted above that ye are able</i>."
His theme was self-sacrifice. Moved by the
hidden springs of wretchedness and indecision
within him, he spoke with a fervor
which stirred his listeners to enthusiasm; his
voice gathered strength as he proceeded, and
his pale face shone as with the glory of
martyrdom.</p>

<p>Olive Herring, in her pew, with Madame
de Jolibois seated beside her, heard the voice
of the speaker as through a dream; the
sense of his words penetrated but vaguely to
her understanding. Her feeling for the man
overpowered for the moment all thought of
the preacher and his vocation. She dared
not glance at him lest the conscious look in
her eyes should disturb his impassioned flow
of thought. She might indeed have gazed
her fill, for he kept his own eyes sedulously
turned away from that part of the church in
which she sat.</p>

<p>"The parson wrastled like he had a powerful
purchase on ole Satan!" remarked
Dud Welsh with a laugh to his companion,
as they walked away from the church together.</p>

<p>"Poor young man!" commented Miss

<!-- page 179 -->

Kizzy to Olive. "He must have some
hidden trouble, a thorn in the flesh, like St.
Paul."</p>

<p>Olive did not reply, but she smiled, secure
in the knowledge of their secret, his and
hers!</p>

<p>She waited for him through the drowsy
afternoon in the shady summer-house, disappointed
but no-wise disturbed by his non-appearance.</p>

<p>"Sunday is always a busy day with him;
he will come to-morrow," she whispered to
herself confidently, answering the summons
to dinner.</p>

<p>Herring looked up at his daughter as
she entered the dining-room, and glanced at
the vacant places usually occupied by Jeffrey
and Kennison. He moved uneasily in
his chair and seemed about to question her,
but checked himself, evidently reassured by
her calm and happy face.</p>

<p>"What a delightful dinner-party!" he
said gayly as they arose from the table.
"Better company than all the senators and
judges, planters and preachers we have been
accustomed to dine with lately, eh, Olive?"</p>

<p>He drew her hand through his arm and
walked with her up and down the long gallery,

<!-- page 180 -->

chatting almost eagerly. It was the first
time his daughter ever remembered to have
seen him like this&mdash;though those who had
known him in former times would have exclaimed,
"The old Van Herring!" He was
boyishly enthusiastic, talking of his plans for
himself and her; and overflowing with what
seemed to her a new-born tenderness. It
was an evening long to be remembered.</p>

<p>She wished to speak to him of Kennison,
but refrained&mdash;for her lover had begged to
be allowed to plead his own cause. But she
had no longer any doubts. She felt that
he divined her happiness and rejoiced in it.</p>

<p>"Oh! how noble he is, my father! my
hero!" she murmured when with his good
night kiss on her brow, she went up to her
own room. "No wonder that he and Mark"&mdash;she
breathed the name shyly&mdash;"no wonder
they were drawn to each other from the
first."</p>

<p>Nor had the father's unwonted mood
passed the next morning. He laughed and
jested with his daughter over the breakfast-table,
and lingered talking to her long after
his usual hour for leaving the house. When
at length he kissed her and drove away in
the direction of Fair View, he looked back

<!-- page 181 -->

to shout a greeting to her. She waved her
hand, standing on the high steps, but gave
a sudden start, as a vague picture floated
suddenly through her brain&mdash;a picture of
Young Van riding away to his death that
spring morning! The vision passed as
quickly as it came, and she ran down into
the rose-garden.</p>

<p>She was in the little morning-room when
Kennison came. The half-withered flowers
which he had gathered for her the Saturday
before were in a vase on the table beside
her. She sprang to meet him with a glad
smile. He came forward slowly, and barely
touched her outstretched hands with his,
which were cold and clammy.</p>

<p>"Olive," he began, "Miss Herring "&mdash;he
paused, confused by the growing wonder in
her eyes; "I&mdash;I"&mdash;he went on desperately,&mdash;"since 
I saw you last, I have heard
the story of Miss Thornham's diamonds"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Thornham's diamonds?" repeated
Olive, puzzled.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and of your&mdash;of Colonel Herring's
supposed connection with their disappearance,"
he stammered.</p>

<p>"Of my father's"&mdash;</p>

<p>He interrupted her eagerly. He was no

<!-- page 182 -->

longer conscious of what he said, but seemed
possessed by a mad haste to unburden himself 
of the terrible story; the words poured
from his lips in an irresistible torrent. To do
him justice, it had not occurred to him that
the daughter might, by some miracle, through
all these years, have been spared the knowledge
of her father's dishonor. He told the
story, not indeed as it had been told him;
sparing her instinctively, softening ugly
phrases and suppressing many details. But
he told it, nevertheless.</p>

<p>When he left his study after a second
sleepless and wretched night, he had not
known definitely what he meant to say to
her. Certainly he had not foreseen that the
sight of her would arouse in him an insane
desire to justify to his own better nature
the course he had decided upon pursuing.
What he had called duty seemed to him, as
he concluded, the basest cowardice.</p>

<p>She heard him to the end, standing motionless
before him, with her arms hanging,
and her eyes fixed upon his face.</p>

<p>"Do you really mean to tell me, Mr. Kennison,"
she said slowly when he had finished,
"that the people of Thornham, my father's
friends and neighbors, who have known him

<!-- page 183 -->

since his early manhood, have for thirteen
years believed him to be an unscrupulous
criminal? And that, believing him to be
so base, they have continued to associate
with him and his family? to come to his
house and accept his hospitality?"</p>

<p>Kennison did not reply. A terrible conviction
was forcing itself upon him.</p>

<p>"Can it be, Olive," he panted, horror-stricken,
"that you have never heard this
story before?"</p>

<p>"I have never heard it," she returned in
a hard voice, "and I wish you to understand,
Mr. Kennison, that I know it to be
false&mdash;wickedly, monstrously, cruelly false.
My father," she lifted her head proudly,&mdash;"my
father! the truest, bravest, gentlest,
and most loyal gentleman&mdash;<i>my father!</i>"
she put her hand to her throat to check a
rising sob there.</p>

<p>Kennison, overwhelmed by a sense of his
own brutality, fairly staggered, clutching at
a corner of the table for support. "My
God, what have I done! O, Olive, can you
ever forgive"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you be good enough to go," she
interrupted coldly. Then, suddenly losing
control of herself, she cried passionately,

<!-- page 184 -->

"Go! can you not see that your presence is
an insult to my father's daughter!"</p>

<p>He made no further appeal, but stood
looking at her in silence, devouring every
detail of her lovely face, scorching under
the fire of her beautiful angry eyes.</p>

<p>"You cannot despise me more than I
despise myself," he said at length. With
these words he quitted the room and the
house.</p>

<p>Her courage sustained her until the echo
of his footsteps died away. Then, with a
shuddering cry, she dropped to the floor and
buried her face in her hands. A world of
unheeded half-forgotten things rushed upon
her,&mdash;significant glances, whispered phrases,
a hint here, a shake of the head there; the
words spoken by Young Van when he lay
a-dying . . . had she really heard them then?
they rang loudly enough in her ears now!
. . . the strange and unaccountable change
in her father's manner. Oh, she remembered
now how joyous and gay he used to be
at the "other house," and how constrained
and silent after&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, my mother, my poor mother, and
poor, poor little Van!" she moaned. "And
I alone, through all these wretched years,

<!-- page 185 -->

have been foolishly, heartlessly, blindly gay
and light-hearted. Why have they not told
me! Oh, the vile, horrible lie! <i>Father!
Father!</i>"</p>

<p>Through her grief and rage there came
now and then another and a keener pang.
But this she resolutely put aside.</p>

<p>"He never loved me," she said sternly,
"or instead of giving me up, he would surely
have gathered me in his arms and sheltered
me from all pain. That would have been
my father's way&mdash;or Duncan's. Does Duncan
know, I wonder? Oh, I cannot, cannot
bear it."</p>

<p>The recurring thought was intolerable,
and, stung beyond endurance, she sought
her old nurse, and, laying her head against
her bosom, she found relief in a paroxysm
of tears.</p>

<p>"Somep'n's wrong wi' de chile," mused
Betty, stroking the soft hair. "An' de
preacher-man is sho at de bottom of it!"
But neither then nor later did she suspect
the whole truth.</p>

<p>Soothed into at least a semblance of quiet,
Olive awaited with feverish impatience her
father's return. She would throw herself
into his arms and tell it all to him,&mdash;her

<!-- page 186 -->

remorse at not having guessed that some
trouble had clouded his, her mother's, Young
Van's lives; her shame at having been so
frivolous,&mdash;all, all!</p>

<p>She ran to meet him in the late afternoon.
He saw her on the steps as he turned in at
the park-gateway, and shouted a greeting as
he had done that morning. But his face
changed when he looked closely into hers.
She did throw herself into his arms, but the
words she wished to utter died in her throat.
There rose up on the instant between the
father and daughter the impenetrable barrier
which for so many years had lain impassable
between the husband and wife.</p>

<p>He kissed her tenderly, asked a few commonplace
questions concerning the day's
occupations, and passed into his library,
closing the door behind him. Then followed
for Vanborough Herring perhaps the bitterest
hour of his life. He had read but too
clearly in the wistful eyes.</p>

<p><i>He knew that she knew!</i></p>

<p>X.</p>

<p class="small">ELINOR THORNHAM.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> it became known in Thornham
that the visits both of Kennison and Jeffrey
to Roseneath had ceased abruptly, there was
an outburst of curiosity. And, as usual,
there were not wanting theories to explain
the fact; some asserted that Miss Herring
had dismissed both men in favor of a third&mdash;unknown&mdash;admirer;
others declared that
Herring had peremptorily forbidden them
both his house; one rumor had it that Jeffrey,
the fortunate man, was ostentatiously
absenting himself in order to throw gossip
off the scent; another gravely demonstrated
that neither suitor had been really in earnest,
and the pursuit had been discontinued
by a mutual understanding between them,
leaving the field free to whoever chose to
enter it. A few had an inkling of the truth.
Among these was Andrew Barclay, who, uneasy
and contrite, at length sought his pastor,
and quite humbly confessed that, carried

<!-- page 188 -->

away by professional enthusiasm, he had
exaggerated the story of the theft.</p>

<p>"The bottom facts, as known, would not
convict," he concluded remorsefully.</p>

<p>"Pray think no more about the matter,
Mr. Barclay," the preacher returned. "If
I have made mistakes in this affair I alone
am to blame." He spoke with a certain
dull weariness. Something had gone out of
the man. From that time forward, truly,
there was no talk of changes and reforms in
St. John's Church. The rector's sermons
were quite orthodox, and singularly colorless.
Then, by a contradiction not unusual
in human nature, those who had cried out
most loudly against his innovations and his
latitude of creed, cried out more loudly still
against his want of progress.

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

The young mistress of Roseneath found
the days which followed Kennison's revelation
well-nigh unbearable; she shrank painfully
from contact with the people of the
village; she would gladly have denied herself
even to Rose, in whose subtly changed
face she read a knowledge of the shameful
story. Wrung with sympathy for her father,
to whom she felt immeasurably nearer,

<!-- page 189 -->

yet from whom in some inexplicable way,
too, she was infinitely removed, she proudly
forbore to question even her old nurse.
Thus, turned upon herself and tortured by
uncertainty and self-pity, it seemed for a
time as if she were about to succumb like
her mother before her; her step became listless,
her eyes lost their sparkle. Her father
watched her with a solicitude doubled by
the recollection of his former losses. But
something of his own indomitable spirit
presently arose within her, and she found
herself able to smile calmly into familiar
faces, while intuitively selecting from those
about her the few who had known how, unquestioning,
to trust a friend.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the change in her outward
appearance was great; a reserve which bordered
upon hauteur took the place of her
girlish frankness; her open straightforward
gaze became cool and searching; her movements
were less quick and impulsive. The
stately dignity of her bearing enhanced her
beauty a thousand fold.</p>

<p>This sudden transformation seemed little
less than marvelous to those unacquainted
with its secret spring.</p>

<p>In a short time, fearful of disappointing

<!-- page 190 -->

or injuring her father, she resumed as nearly
as possible the life which had been so rudely
interrupted, filling Roseneath&mdash;beautiful
under the blue autumnal skies&mdash;with guests
and giving it a semblance at least of all its
former gayety. Kennison she saw only from
a distance, or from the pew in his church,
which she continued to occupy, bearing the
keen gaze of the public with such proud
calm that criticism was disarmed and gossip
itself disconcerted.</p>

<p>Jeffrey had resumed somewhat of his old
position in the household, though his visits
were fewer and of a more formal character.</p>

<p>He sat with her one day, watching her
active preparations for the coming season in
Washington&mdash;for Herring, as had been
foreseen, had received an almost unanimous
vote at the election. "Olive," he said resolutely,
though with an embarrassed air,
"Kennison has ceased to come to Roseneath.
Does that mean"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am no longer engaged to Mr. Kennison,"
she interrupted, a trifle haughtily.</p>

<p>His face brightened. He arose and made
a movement toward her. "Then . . . you
have read your own heart more truly . . .
you have found that you do not love him.

<!-- page 191 -->

. . . Perhaps? . . . Olive, will you . . . is
it too soon for me to speak again? . . .
Will you be my wife?"</p>

<p>She shrank from him with a gesture of
horror.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" she cried, "no, that is forever
impossible!"</p>

<p>"Olive," said her father, entering at that
moment with an open letter in his hand,
"we shall have to leave sooner than I had
thought. To-morrow, if possible. Betty
will accompany us. Liberty will remain
behind to close the house, and follow later.
Duncan, my boy," he laid his hand with
unwonted familiarity on the young man's
shoulder, "Thornham is a dull place for a
man with a soul; come with us to Washington."</p>

<p>Jeffrey glanced at Olive before he replied.
"Thank you, Colonel," he said warmly, "I
wish I could; but the grinding at Good
Luck is in full blast and I must be here to
look after it."</p>

<p>He crossed the river the next morning to
the station to see them off. A large number
of Colonel Herring's constituents were
gathered about him on the platform; and
several of Olive's friends, including Madame

<!-- page 192 -->

de Jolibois and Rose, had followed her into
the car. Rose clung, weeping, to her friend,
but she smiled through her tears. "The
things you sent came this morning, Olive,"
she whispered; "the cabin will be lovely
when they are all in place. And I know
I will like keeping house for my father."</p>

<p>"I am sure you will, dear," returned Olive,
kissing the small upturned face.</p>

<p>"If you should meet Monshur d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys
in the sumptuous Halls of our Nation's
Metropolis"&mdash;began Miss Kizzy, but the
train which had been making threatening
movements for half an hour was at last really
about to start, and Jeffrey hurried her
away, cutting short her studied apostrophe.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>The Honorable Vanborough Herring and
his daughter entered at once into the social
life of the Capital. The great wealth and
distinguished air of the one, and the beauty
and charm of the other, made them a welcome
addition even to that wide and brilliant
circle.</p>

<p>To the girl, who saw her father for the
first time unconstrained and wholly at ease,
the transition from the pain and wretchedness
of the past weeks to sudden joyous companionship

<!-- page 193 -->

with him was like a birth into
some new world; the hideous dream was remembered
only when some chance word or
inadvertent reference brought into his eyes
the look which said, "Thus far shalt thou
come&mdash;even thou&mdash;and no farther."</p>

<p>The outer life of the great city interested
and amused her. Balls, dinners, the theatre,&mdash;routs
of all kinds, following each other in
endless succession, found the young stranger
always the centre of a host of admirers. If
a word or look from any of these brought to
her a memory of a twilight hour in the old
summer-house at Roseneath, and of a pair of
dark eyes glowing with masterful love, there
was at least nothing in her own to betray
the thought.</p>

<p>One night toward the end of February
she came down the stairway of their handsome
apartment dressed for a ball, given
in honor of a foreign embassy. Her shoulders
arose white and gleaming above the
foamy lace of her satin gown; jewels
flashed on her bare arms and shone in her
hair. Beautiful and imperious, her face
showed no trace of the shock which, but a
few months earlier, had stunned her into
apathy. Midway on the stair she paused

<!-- page 194 -->

and threw up her head, like a deer in the
forest, which scents a presence on the morning
air. Betty, following her with a heap
of furred wraps on her arm, stopped also
and chuckled softly.</p>

<p>"I knows dat voice, too, Miss Olive! You
ain' mistakened, chile. It's Mars Duncan."</p>

<p>It was Duncan who stood talking gayly
with her father in the drawing-room, and
looking very bright and handsome. He
came forward to meet her.</p>

<p>"I have this moment arrived," he said,
when the warm unembarrassed greetings were
over, "and as I am leaving to-morrow"&mdash;</p>

<p>"To-morrow!" echoed his hosts in a
breath.</p>

<p>"Yes," he explained, "I have leased
Good Luck for a couple of years (the crop,
by the way, this year, Colonel, was the
heaviest ever handled on the plantation) to
Lester, with the privilege of renewing or
buying me out at the end of that time. My
other business is in such a shape that it
does not require my personal attention. I
am going to knock around Europe for a
year or two,&mdash;perhaps longer,&mdash;and I am
hurrying to join some old college friends in
New York who sail on Saturday."</p>

<!-- page 195 -->

<p>Colonel Herring rang for Liberty and
ordered his carriage to be dismissed.</p>

<p>"We will spend the evening at home,
Olive?" he said, half-questioningly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she acquiesced quickly.</p>

<p>Jeffrey protested but faintly, his gaze
wandering hungrily over her as she sat near
him with the firelight playing over her shimmering
gown; her head resting on her hand,
and her luminous eyes fixed upon his face.</p>

<p>The evening sped but too quickly. He
sighed involuntarily as he rose to go.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment, Duncan," said Herring,
"I wish to give you a couple of letters
to some friends in London." He walked
into the library, and Olive and Duncan, left
alone, relapsed into a silence through which
they could hear the scratching of the pen
on paper through the draped doorway.</p>

<p>"Olive," the young man said at last in a
low tone, "I have been hoping that you
would ask me to stay, or that you would
come with me. Am I foolish to speak
again? Yet I must. Will you not give
yourself to me, Olive?"</p>

<p>"No, Duncan," she replied as before,
"that is quite impossible." But seeing him
turn away, the tears sprang to her eyes.

<!-- page 196 -->

She laid her hand on his arm beseechingly.
"But&mdash;but you will not forget me, Duncan,&mdash;your
childhood's friend, your sister?
You will write us sometimes; you will think
of us&mdash;of me?"</p>

<p>"Forget you!" he exclaimed, taking her
hands in his warm clasp. "Olive, do you
imagine that I will not go on loving you as
long as I live! Do you think, dear, that I
could put you out of my life if I tried!"
He paused and added, smiling a little, "It
runs in my family to be faithful. My uncle&mdash;perhaps
you never knew that, Olive?&mdash;my
uncle died, an old man,&mdash;true to the
one woman he had ever loved and whom he
lost in his early manhood. Oh yes. I will
write," he continued, as Herring re&euml;ntered
the room with the letters in his hand, "and
perhaps one day"&mdash;</p>

<p>He left the significant sentence, uttered
in her father's presence, unfinished, and
departed.</p>

<p>"Duncan is a fine fellow; I wish you
could have loved him well enough to marry
him, Olive," Herring said, after a long
silence, during which he mused with his
eyes fixed abstractedly on the fire.</p>

<p>These were the only words he ever uttered

<!-- page 197 -->

which betrayed his knowledge of what
had been passing in his daughter's life.</p>

<p>"I cannot marry Duncan," she replied,
paling. "I shall never marry. Why
should I?" she continued in a lighter tone,
coming over and putting her arms about his
neck, "have I not you?"</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>Herring's private affairs in the late spring
necessitated a flying trip to Thornham; he
announced this to Olive, suggesting, though
but half-heartedly, that she remain in Washington
during his brief absence.</p>

<p>"How dare you hint such a thing!" she
cried with saucy indignation. "No, indeed!
You are too attractive by far to be
allowed to travel alone, Colonel Herring!
Even in stupid old Thornham some woman
might set a trap for you"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Kizzy?" he demanded demurely.</p>

<p>"Now, papa," she admonished gravely,
with uplifted finger. "You know that
Monshur d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys is a husband. And
there would certainly be bloodshed!"</p>

<p>Whereat they laughed like a pair of children.</p>

<p>Liberty, who had preceded them, met
them on their arrival at Thornham.</p>

<!-- page 198 -->

<p>"De river's on a big rise, Mars Van," he
remarked, leading the way to the carriage.</p>

<p>The horses threw up their heads, and
pulled back with quivering nostrils and
trembling flanks, when he attempted to lead
them on the ferry-boat which rose and fell
oil the swirling current, and it was some moments
before he succeeded in calming them.</p>

<p>The steadily rising water, blood-red and
flecked with foam, was within a foot of the
grass-grown edge of the high bluffs. Its
surface was covered with floating d&eacute;bris,&mdash;tree-trunks,
broken barrels, hencoops, bits
of shingle, what not, from above, which
made it difficult for John Hopson, the old
ferryman, to manage the passage. Jack
Addington, standing in the door of his warehouse,
which seemed dangerously near the
bank, saw them approaching and came out
to greet them. He was a small, shrewd-looking
man, with a forceful face and pleasant
quizzical eyes.</p>

<p>"I think we are in for a whizzer this time,
Colonel," he said. "I hope Fair View is
in good shape to stand it?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," responded Herring confidently,
"but how about the warehouse?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Addington, "I'm trusting

<!-- page 199 -->

some in Providence, and a good deal in
bricks and mortar, for the warehouse. You
look like a Roseneath rose, Olive! Making
laws for your country agrees with you."</p>

<p>He removed his foot from the carriage-step
and they drove rapidly to Roseneath,
where, five minutes later, Betty was scolding
Big Hannah, and browbeating 'Liza
and Job, for all manner of (presumable)
crimes committed during her absence.</p>

<p>It was very peaceful and quiet at the old
place. Olive came out upon the gallery
about an hour before sunset, and stood looking
over the familiar landscape. The magnolias
shading the steps were starred with
great white cups; the wholesome odor of
these mingled with the perfume of damask-roses&mdash;"Mother-roses,"
she and Van used
to call them!&mdash;abloom in the rose-garden.
A boat was slipping Gulf-ward on the river,
its black hull dancing high on the swollen
stream; a light wind swayed the tops of the
live-oaks. She turned her eyes in the direction
of the village, where the slim needle of
St. John's spire arose above the surrounding
roofs; a slight flush colored her cheeks, and
an inscrutable smile played about her lips.</p>

<p>"Papa!" she called to Herring, who sat

<!-- page 200 -->

at his library-table within, writing. "Do
not work any longer to-day. Come on the
gallery with me."</p>

<p>He rose obediently, gathering some papers
together and thrusting them into his breast
pocket, and came out. He passed his hand
wearily over his forehead; he looked careworn
and pale.</p>

<p>"Why, father," she cried, "are you ill?"</p>

<p>He shook his head, smiling.</p>

<p>"Then you are very tired, and no wonder;
sit here and rest."</p>

<p>She pulled a chair forward, and when he
was seated she nestled on the floor at his
feet, leaning her head against his knee.</p>

<p>He stroked her hair absently with his hand.</p>

<p>"Olive," he asked abruptly, after a moment's
silence, "do you remember your
cousin, Elinor Thornham?"</p>

<p>The question drove the blood from her
heart; her lips trembled so that she could
not speak. But the quiet look on his face
as she glanced furtively up reassured her.</p>

<p>"Why yes," she said, "I remember her.
She sent for me once&mdash;here. I can dimly
recall her face bending over me while she
held me on her lap. She gave me a doll
which had been hers when she was a child.

<!-- page 201 -->

I think, though I am not quite sure, that Big
Hannah and I broke it the same day!
Afterward, one day when Van and I were
playing in the garden at the other house,
she called us to her carriage in passing, and
talked to us. Oh yes, I remember her."</p>

<p>"You are like her, Olive, wonderfully like
her. She was very beautiful," he mused
more to himself than to his daughter. Then,
slowly and formally as if rehearsing a care
fully thought-out tale, he went on: "I was
hardly more than a lad when I came to
Thornham, Olive,&mdash;fresh from college, and
poor, but full of energy and ambition. The
Thornhams and the Vanboroughs&mdash;my
mother's people&mdash;were closely related; and
it was at the suggestion of Steven Thornham&mdash;her
father&mdash;that I left Kentucky to try
my fortune in Texas. She was but a slip of
a girl when I first saw her&mdash;here at Roseneath.
She had no sisters; and John, her
only brother, had left home, after a bitter
quarrel with his father, four or five years
before. The mother's heart was with her
exiled boy; the father was stormy and eccentric;
but in spite of this, Roseneath was
very gay; and Elinor, as young as she was,
was the acknowledged leader of the social

<!-- page 202 -->

life&mdash;then very brilliant&mdash;in Thornham.
She was very beautiful, high-spirited, and
somewhat willful, and the idol of her father,
who somehow favored my suit from the
first; for, from the moment I came into her
presence, I began to love Elinor Thornham."</p>

<p>Olive made an involuntary movement,
shrinking almost imperceptibly away from
him; but he drew her head again to his
knee and continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Among her many suitors I had but one
rival, Peter Newall. Perhaps you cannot
think of him, Olive, as an ardent wooer,&mdash;shabby
quiet old Newall! But in those
days he also was young and eager, with life
before him. And he loved her; he had
loved her long before I ever saw her,&mdash;since
she was a little girl; and I think&mdash;I
know&mdash;that she was fond of him. But
it was I whom she loved! It had all come
about so naturally that the possibility of
any change or interruption to the course of
our love-life never troubled me. Her father
stipulated only that we should wait until
my law-practice should be on a firmer basis.
It was the rosy morning of my life."</p>

<p>His voice lost its monotony and thrilled
with exultant passion.</p>

<!-- page 203 -->

<p>"I saw her daily. There is not a path in
the rose-garden yonder that I have not
walked with her, nor a nook or corner about
Roseneath in which some memory of that
happy time does not linger. The date was
fixed for our marriage, when her father died
suddenly; and in less than two months
Mrs. Thornham followed him, leaving Elinor
alone in the world, except for the almost
unknown brother who lived in New Orleans,
and who was abroad at the time of his
mother's death. Up to this moment Elinor's
affection for me had seemed boundless.
Through the trying time of her mother's
death and burial she clung to me as
her only and natural protector, and we had
arranged that the marriage, in spite of her
mourning, should take place at once. No
man, surely, was ever happier than I was
the morning a summons came from my
betrothed bride appointing an hour for me
to call at Roseneath. Strange as this summons
seemed, since I was in the habit of
spending a part of every day at Roseneath,
I yet had no suspicion of anything wrong.
At the appointed hour I found her in the
summer-house waiting for me. She seemed
utterly transformed. Her manner was cold

<!-- page 204 -->

to haughtiness, her voice was hard, her lips
set and cruel. I gazed at her in dismay
while she told me in a few measured words
that our engagement was at an end. She
declined giving her reasons; but when I
stormed and raved against her cruelty, she
admitted that she had ceased to love me. I
pleaded in vain; she begged my forgiveness
indeed when she saw my despair. When I
thought it over afterward, I seemed to remember
a softening light in her eyes, and a
quivering about the corners of her mouth;
but at the time I was half-blind with anger
and mortification, and I saw nothing. I
flung myself away from her with words
which I do not now like to recall. The
next day I left Thornham for my old home
in Kentucky, persuaded I would never return.</p>

<p>"There I met again the little girl, grown
to womanhood since I had last seen her, to
whom in our school-days I had plighted my
boyish troth,&mdash;Jeanie, your mother, Olive,
the sweetest, truest, most loyal woman and
wife that ever blessed a man's heart and
home!"</p>

<p>He lifted his hand, wet with Olive's tears,
to his own brimming eyes. The child's

<!-- page 205 -->

heart throbbed with exquisite emotion at
this tribute to the mother for whose memory
a moment before she had felt such jealous
pangs.</p>

<p>Herring remained silent a short time.
When he resumed there was a change in his
tone, as if some mighty undercurrent of
feeling, to which the history of his love-life
had been but a prelude, were about to make
itself felt.</p>

<p>"We were both poor&mdash;Jeanie and I&mdash;though
some of my family were rich and
influential; and after a time we decided to
come to Thornham, where I owned a small
piece of property&mdash;the 'other house,'
which Van and his mother loved so. She
knew the story of my early love, but she had
no fear, for she also knew that Elinor Thornham
was less than the shadow of a shade in
my life, beside her own blooming image.
We were very happy in the cottage where
you were all born, Olive, though I was still
poor, and Jeanie had to make many sacrifices.
I saw Elinor occasionally. She was
a semi-invalid and lived alone in this lonely
house with her housekeeper and her servants.
She called on my wife when we
first came to Thornham; and we made one

<!-- page 206 -->

or two visits to Roseneath. But her health
soon failed entirely, and she ceased to go
anywhere. Yes, we were very happy. No
wonder my boy longed for that 'other
house!'</p>

<p>"Well... the years passed.... One
morning, Liberty, who was Elinor's butler,
brought a note to my office. It was a summons&mdash;for
the second time&mdash;to Roseneath.
The hour fixed was half past eight o'clock
the same evening. I confess that my heart
stirred a little when I saw the handwriting,
but the feeling uppermost was curiosity. As
night approached, I found myself growing
impatient, and as soon as the hour struck, I
left home and walked out the familiar road to
Roseneath. The moon was shining brightly
as I passed along the avenue to the house;
but I saw no one, and when I reached the door
it was opened for me by Elinor herself; so
pale, so weak and trembling, that she fell
almost fainting in my arms. I carried her
into the sitting-room and laid her upon the
couch. When she recovered sufficiently to
speak, she explained that she had purposely
sent every one out of the way, wishing to see
me alone and without question or comment,
even from her own family."</p>

<!-- page 207 -->

<p>Olive was listening now with a strained
attention that caused her heart to stand still.</p>

<p>"She was thin and worn, but she was still
beautiful, as she lay there lifting her large
lustrous eyes to mine."</p>

<p>"<i>Something in a man dies hard!</i>"
Olive seemed to hear the echo of old Isham's
words in her father's voice.</p>

<p>"I need not tell you all that passed between
us; though the interview was not a
long one. She felt that death was upon her;
and she wished before she died to tell me
why she had broken the sacred vows that
had once bound our lives together. I can
see her now,&mdash;her slight form supported by
pillows, clad in the soft and clinging white
she loved! She held in her hand a small
jewel-box,&mdash;the cursed necklet, which, as
sure as there is a God in Heaven, caused the
death of my wife, and of my son."</p>

<p>The last words broke from him in a sort
of fury. But he seemed unconscious of having
uttered them. His daughter's heart
throbbed painfully. Kennison's story rushed
back upon her. What was she about to
hear? She could hardly forbear crying out
and beseeching him, in mercy to himself and
to her, to say no more!</p>

<!-- page 208 -->

<p>But he took up the thread again.</p>

<p>"This is what she told me, stopping often
to take breath, for she was pitifully weak
and suffering. I knelt, helpless, beside the
couch. She had never ceased to love me.
Her whole heart, from the moment she saw
me first, was mine, and mine only. But&mdash;a
malady which had kept her delicate, as a
child, and troubled her girlhood&mdash;curious
lapses of consciousness, which left her faint
and ill&mdash;it was only after her mother's
death, and when she was doubly orphaned,
that she knew its nature and meaning&mdash;<i>Epilepsy</i>.
She had been kept in ignorance
of the very word. Almost by chance she
had heard it applied to the attack which
seized her a few days after her mother's
death. She insisted upon knowing from the
physician who had attended her from her
babyhood the nature of the disease; and
horror-stricken at his explanation, she determined
not to commit the crime of marriage.
But she could not bring herself to
tell me the real reason. Perhaps she feared
her own power of resistance; for she must
have known that such an argument would
have small weight in a lover's eyes. And
she chose rather to let me believe her false

<!-- page 209 -->

and cruel. You know already how the engagement
ended. . . . When I left her, I
opened a window and went out upon the
gallery, and crossed the rose-garden."</p>

<p>He stopped and leaned back in his large
chair. Olive&mdash;all her senses wrought to
agony&mdash;was listening still.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and the necklet, father, the diamonds?"
she said, unable longer to endure
the suspense.</p>

<p>"Oh, the cursed diamonds!" his voice
was thick and smothered; he spoke as if
his tongue were cleaving to the roof of his
mouth. "Yes, the diamonds. I took them
from her, and put"&mdash;</p>

<p>Again he was silent; so long that the
silence became intolerable. She pressed
closer to him, trembling in every limb.</p>

<p>"Yes, father, I know how it was," she
stammered eagerly. "I understand perfectly.
You need not mind telling me. I
know that you meant to give them back . . .
the next day. Oh, father, you <i>did</i> mean to
give them back?"</p>

<p>A heavy groan was the only response.
She felt a sort of shiver pass through the
hand she held in hers.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 210 -->

<div class="center" id="ch11">

<p>XI.</p>

<p class="small">DEATH IN LIFE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Olive</span> sprang to her feet, startled by a
nameless fear. Her father's head had fallen
to one side; his eyes were partly closed and
devoid of expression; his lips were rigid;
one arm hung inert at his side; the other,
as Olive loosened her hold upon it, fell like
a lifeless thing across his breast.</p>

<p>The girl's terrified shrieks aroused the
household; the servants flocked in.</p>

<p>"Don't be skeered, Miss Olive," Liberty
said confidently, " 'tain't nothin' but a
faintin'-fit."</p>

<p>He lifted his master in his strong arms,
and bore him into an inner room, where
they exhausted, without apparent effect, the
usual remedies. It seemed a long time to
the helpless watchers before the doctor came;
it was in reality but a short half-hour.</p>

<p>He was accompanied by Newall, who
chanced to be at his office when the messenger
arrived. He cleared the room of all

<!-- page 211 -->

but Liberty, and began a close examination
of his patient. It was some time before he
came out upon the gallery, where Olive,
pale and agitated, awaited him, in company
with the lawyer.</p>

<p>"Is he better, Doctor Alsbury?" she demanded
eagerly. "Has he revived?"</p>

<p>"He is sleeping," the doctor answered
evasively; "send some one to town with this
prescription at once," he added, handing
her a slip of paper.</p>

<p>"Is it death?" asked Newall, when she
was out of hearing.</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head.</p>

<p>"It is worse than death," he said. "It
is almost complete paralysis of the body,
involving the brain."</p>

<p>"He cannot recover?"</p>

<p>"He cannot recover, except by a miracle;
and he may live for years in this condition."</p>

<p>"My God!" groaned the lawyer; "who
will tell his daughter this?"</p>

<p>"I will tell her myself," Doctor Alsbury
said gravely; "or I will at least tell her
what she must of necessity know: that her
father has had a stroke of paralysis which
will render him for some time absolutely
helpless."</p>

<!-- page 212 -->

<p>He did tell her, taking her apart, and remaining
with her&mdash;less the physician than
the lifelong friend of her father and mother&mdash;until
the first paroxysm of agony had a
little spent itself. Then at her own request
he led her into the room where her father
was.</p>

<p>The lamplight fell upon his face, for it
was long past nightfall; his eyes stared
vacantly from beneath their half-closed lids;
he breathed heavily.</p>

<p>"He is awake," said the doctor, laying
his palm gently upon the broad forehead.</p>

<p>The only perceptible difference between
the sleeping and the waking state of the
stricken man was in the slight lifting of the
heavy eyelids, and a restless movement of
the lips.</p>

<p>"It may be a long time before he will be
able to move, Olive," Doctor Alsbury went
on, looking down compassionately at the
lifeless body and ghastly face. "He will
have to be fed and cared for like an infant.
Liberty will attend to that."</p>

<p>Liberty nodded, unable to speak; his
massive chest was heaving and his dark
cheeks were wet with tears.</p>

<p>The daughter had dropped with a wail of

<!-- page 213 -->

anguish on her knees by the bedside, and
was covering her father's motionless hand
with kisses.</p>

<p>The next morning she followed the physician
out of the room. She had watched
through the long hours of the night with
Liberty,&mdash;hoping, despairing, praying. It
seemed monstrous that the returning light
should have brought no change for the
better.</p>

<p>"He is just the same?" she implored piteously.</p>

<p>"Yes, my child." The old doctor drew
her head against his shoulder, striving to
soothe her. "He is just the same. You
must try and bear it."</p>

<p>She broke away from him and lifted her
eyes earnestly to his face.</p>

<p>"Doctor Alsbury," she asked, "do you
think my father is conscious? Do you think
he can hear, or understand?"</p>

<p>The doctor hesitated.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," he replied slowly, "it
may be,&mdash;it may possibly be."</p>

<p>She left him and walked swiftly back
into her father's room.</p>

<p>"Please leave me alone with him a moment,"
she said gently to Madame de Jolibois

<!-- page 214 -->

and Mrs. Alsbury, who sat by the
bed.</p>

<p>They went out softly, closing the door behind
them.</p>

<p>She knelt beside him and laid her cheek
against his; then, drawing back, she gazed
steadily upon his face.</p>

<p>"He is awake," she sobbed tenderly, for
the eyelids were partially raised. "Father,"
she said in a clear loud voice, "I am sure
that you can hear your little girl. Listen,
father, I love you. <i>I love you!</i> And I
know that you did not carry away Elinor
Thornham's jewels. My brave, true-hearted,
hero-father! <i>I know that you did not take
Elinor Thornham's diamonds</i>."</p>

<p>There was not a quiver on the marble-like
face; not a movement of the thick
eyelashes. But she rose from her knees
comforted. And from that day forward,
as long as her father lived, her first act
upon rising in the morning was to repeat,
kneeling beside him, like a prayer, the same
simple and fervent words.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>The next day after Herring was stricken
with paralysis, the river began to shrink
once more within its banks. Jack Actington's

<!-- page 215 -->

warehouse stood, squat and sturdy, uninjured,
with the marks of the flood on its
rusty bricks; but this time the swirling
waters did not spare Fair View; the young
cane, wrenched up by the roots and trampled
into the ground, was totally destroyed;
fences, cabins, outhouses were beaten out of
existence by the angry sweep of <i>The Arms
of God;</i> the frightened live stock, huddled
together in the fields, perished; the laborers,
fleeing empty-handed, barely escaped
with their lives. The destruction was complete!</p>

<p>XII.</p>

<p class="small">ROSE.</p>

</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">It</span> is inexplicable! It is incredible!"
the lawyer pushed the mass of papers before
him to one side of the table, and, leaning his
head on his hand, stared with frowning eyes
into space.</p>

<p>It was long past midnight; Peter Newall,
in his ill-lighted, shabby little office, had
been poring for hours over the documents
placed in his hands by Olive Herring,&mdash;letters,
deeds, memoranda, receipts, accounts,&mdash;everything
pertaining to Vanborough Herring's
business which she had been able to
find. They were methodically arranged,
labeled, and dated; there was no confusion
or disarray about them. Herring had always
attended to his own business affairs.
Only on rare occasions had he ever been
known to intrust any matter relating to his
private concerns into other hands. Newall's
investigation had therefore been easy enough.
The papers dated back to the purchase of

<!-- page 217 -->

Roseneath, and included all transactions up
to the moment of the late departure from
Washington for Thornham. The revelation
contained in these carefully annotated documents
was of so extraordinary a nature that
the lawyer, scarcely believing the evidence
of his own senses, had returned to them
again and again, but always with the same
result.</p>

<p>The fabric which the successful advocate,
politician, and planter had reared with such
apparent ease, and which had reached such
imposing proportions, was, it appeared, built
upon a foundation so slender that it was
already tottering to a fall under its own
weight. Roseneath mortgaged to its full
value; Fair View loaded with debt; notes
falling due for which no provision could
possibly be made; the very belongings of
stables and outhouses unpaid for! There
were indications showing that the masterhand
which had planned and builded the
structure had been at work, and the danger
might for a time have been averted, or at
least postponed. As it was, the ruin was
inevitable and imminent.</p>

<p>"It is inconceivable," the lawyer repeated,
"inexplicable. Poor, poor child!"</p>

<!-- page 218 -->

<p>He arose and paced up and down the
room, a thousand vague plans crowding
upon his wearied brain; the only definite
conclusion being a determination to keep
from the daughter, so far as possible, the
knowledge of her father's financial wreck,
and her own helpless and dependent condition.
In this, however, he reckoned without
a sufficient understanding of the strong and
resolute character of the girl herself.</p>

<p>"I wish to know exactly how my father's
business affairs stand, Mr. Newall," she said
quietly when that gentleman presented himself,
a week later, at Roseneath, and began
his carefully prepared statement.</p>

<p>"My dear child"&mdash;he stammered.</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Newall," she interrupted, smiling
a little at his discomfiture," I saw
enough in those papers before I put them
into your hands to assure me, inexperienced
as I am, that serious trouble was impending.
I know that the crop at Fair
View, upon which my father must have
counted, is totally destroyed. I must know
the exact truth. You need not be afraid of
my strength or courage. I am my father's
daughter."</p>

<p>It was now nearly a month since the fatal

<!-- page 219 -->

stroke had fallen upon the master of Roseneath.
The doctor's prognostication was but
too true. The inert body lay, day after day,
heavy, motionless, dead; always the same
vacant nearly closed eyes, the livid face, the
twitching lips, the muffled breathing. The
household, after the first days of terrified
expectation and despair, had fallen into a
forlorn sort of routine. Liberty and Betty
watched by turns at night; dressed and
undressed the nearly inanimate body, and
pressed, morsel by morsel, at proper intervals,
food and drink between the lips. Through
the long summer days Olive sat beside him,
slowly yielding up her hopes for his recovery.
Miss Kizzy, Mrs. Alsbury, Newall,
Addington, and other friends came and went
from the silent chamber. Rose, with frightened
face, hovered about the door, rarely
crossing the threshold. The idle servants
loitered about the great deserted rooms, gossiping
in hushed whispers.</p>

<p>Olive looked at the lawyer in silence when
the papers had finally been examined, and all
legal technicalities clearly explained to her.</p>

<p>"It is worse than I thought," she said
at last. Her face was pale but determined.
"You will sell Fair View, of course," she

<!-- page 220 -->

continued, "and arrange as far as possible
to have my father's debts paid"&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear young lady," Newall hastened
to break in, "the homestead law of this State
allows you"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am of age, or will be in a few weeks,"
she interrupted imperiously, "and I wish
everything sold that is salable. Every cent
must be applied to the payment of my father's
debts. And we must of course leave
Roseneath at once."</p>

<p>Her lips quivered a little as she said this
and her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>"No, my child, no," replied Newall decidedly.
"I have a late letter from Mr.
B&mdash;&mdash;, who holds the mortgage on Roseneath.
He is not prepared to take control.
He desires for the sake of the place itself
that you should remain for the present in
the house."</p>

<p>This was perfectly true, though it was the
result of his own arguments and unbusinesslike
entreaties to the good-natured, wealthy
and careless young fellow who had advanced
a large sum of money to Herring on the
property.</p>

<p>"I am glad," she replied with a grateful
look. "It would be terrible for him to find

<!-- page 221 -->

himself in a strange place when he recovers
consciousness. But I must find something
to do that will enable us to live"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, Olive," interrupted Newall eagerly,
and with a hint of reproach in his voice,
"you know that I have no one in the world
but myself to look after,&mdash;selfish old bachelor
that I am! I have known you since
you were a baby; you are dearer to me than
you dream of. I am not a rich man, but I
have enough for us all. You are not too
proud to let me take care of you and your
father?"</p>

<p>She clasped her hands about his arm and
looked up in his face, struggling for a moment
with the sobs in her throat.</p>

<p>"No, I am not too proud," she said at
length. "I will be grateful, oh, more grateful
than I can hope to tell you, for anything
you can do for <i>him</i>. But I must help, dear
friend. I must learn to support myself."</p>

<p>He went away, content perforce with this;
and while busied with the by no means easy
task of getting the most out of the ruined
estate, arranging with creditors and selling
off superfluous stock, he managed, with the
help of Mrs. Alsbury and Madame de Jolibois,
to get the promise of a few pupils for

<!-- page 222 -->

his ward. In a little less than three months
from the day the envied young heiress
reached Thornham from Washington, Fair
View's new owner was rebuilding its fences;
the stables at Roseneath were empty; the
costlier furniture of the house was sold; the
servants, with the exception of Liberty and
Betty, were scattered far and wide; the
former master was lying helpless and unconscious
in one of its rooms, while in another,
a penniless girl was trying to earn
her daily living by teaching school.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>The Hand of God, according to the open-mouthed
and awestruck gossips, had fallen
again&mdash;heavily, heavily!</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that Peter Newall
was the only one of her father's old
friends who hastened with offers of practical
assistance to the forlorn young creature so
suddenly and so awfully bereft. More than
one of Herring's colleagues in office tried&mdash;in
ways more or less tactful&mdash;to place
her above the necessity of daily labor,&mdash;the
Alsburys; Major Burnham, fat, pursy,
and self-important, but kind-hearted; Jack
Addington, hesitating and embarrassed in

<!-- page 223 -->

the depths of his stiff shirt-collar, and pretending
that there was a balance&mdash;ahem&mdash;still
unpaid on an old note&mdash;ahem&mdash;he'd
been owin' the Colonel for&mdash;ahem&mdash;he
didn't know how many years; and above
all, Miss Kizzy, who was ready to vacate
her Doric-pillared mansion and dwell in the
kitchen if only Vanborough&mdash;"Why, it was
your father, Olive (poor as he was then),
who took care of Serena while I, through
Miss Thornham's generosity, studied the
Saltatory Art in New Orleans,&mdash;though he
would never let me tell it"&mdash;if only Olive
and her father would take possession of it.</p>

<p>But all these offers, acknowledged with
simple and unaffected gratitude, were declined,
and the stuff of which she was made
began to assert itself.</p>

<p>The young teacher chose for her school
room at Roseneath, not the remote upper
hall where her own gay school-days had
passed; but a spacious guest-chamber opening
into the library and upon a curve of the
wide gallery. From where she sat, with the
row of small faces in front of her desk,
she could see&mdash;in pleasant weather&mdash;her
father, in the low wheeled chair which Liberty
had constructed for him. Betty, after

<!-- page 224 -->

pushing him out into a vine-hung corner of
the gallery, would sit beside him through
the long mornings, sewing or mending, and
crooning to herself and to him in a subdued
voice familiar plantation lullabies. The
school-children were so placed that they
could not see him; Olive had contrived this,
lest the sight of the swathed and motionless
figure should frighten them.</p>

<p>It was but a handful of scholars which
was intrusted at first&mdash;and most of them
out of sheer pity&mdash;to the sometime chatelaine
of Roseneath. Presently others came;
for it was soon noised about the village that
Miss Herring had a "knack" at teaching.
She entered upon her new vocation timidly
enough; but was surprised after a few days
to find herself loving it for its own sake.
Moreover, she loved the children and they
loved her. As time passed on&mdash;for this
was but the beginning of a succession of
monotonous and uneventful days which
stretched on into years&mdash;she regained, despite
the death-in-life brooding over the
house, much of her natural buoyancy; the
color came back to her cheeks, the spring to
her step.</p>

<p>They continued to live at Roseneath.

<!-- page 225 -->

For, the mortgage foreclosed and the place
offered for sale, no purchaser presenting himself,
it remained, whether or no, in the hands
of the mortgagee. The latter, after a visit
to his property, wrote frankly to Newall.
"I do not care to put any more money upon
that elephant," he said. "If I see a chance
to sell, I shall sell. If you can rent it to a
good paying tenant, please do so. In the
mean time, if Miss Herring will consent to
remain in it and so keep it from dropping to
pieces, I shall regard it as a favor to myself."</p>

<p>Thus, rarely going beyond the boundaries
of the place, surrounded by innocently affectionate
children, whom she taught after
a happy fashion of her own, and seeing
only the faces of the old and tried friends
who came to her, she well-nigh forgot the
shadow which had crushed her mother and
brother, and darkened her father's career;
that mysterious and terrible shadow which,
falling upon herself, had in one swift moment
changed her confidence into defiant
mistrust, and chilled love itself out of her
pathway. The unquestioning faith of her
childhood, the innocent faith in God and
man,&mdash;adorable in its simplicity,&mdash;had not

<!-- page 226 -->

returned to her; nothing indeed can restore
that, once it is lost! But her mind and heart,
working silently over the problem of life,
had found the higher faith which comes
through earnest seeking. Of this the healthy
inner and outer life&mdash;even in the midst of
toil and anxiety&mdash;was the result. The time
predicted for her had come: she had learned
to feel and to think!</p>

<p>The Reverend Mark Kennison, in the
early days of her father's affliction, came
several times in his priestly capacity, but
soon desisted, repulsed by her coldness.</p>

<p>Newall, to whom she turned more and
more for counsel and comfort, was much
with her. Unaware that she held the secret
of his inner life, he talked to her sometimes
of a girl "like her" whom he had once
known. This invariably brought the pang
that everything connected with Elinor Thornham
gave her. But it served to increase her
growing affection for the man whose life had
been as love-lonely as her own promised to
be. His encouragement tided her over the
first uncertain months of her attempt at self-support;
his practical advice helped to solve
the problem of daily living. At his suggestion,
Liberty enlarged the kitchen-garden

<!-- page 227 -->

and added to the scanty income by selling
the vegetables which he raised.</p>

<p>"Or perhaps, Lib," the lawyer said hesitatingly,
"you and Betty may prefer to go
away. In that case"&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the name o' Gawd, Mars Pete," interrupted
Liberty indignantly, "does you
<i>p'intedly</i> s'pose me an' Betty has got black
insides, 'caze ou' outsides happens to be
black? No, Mist' Newall, ez long ez ou'
heads is hot, me an' Betty b'longs to Mars
Van an' Miss Olive. <i>B'longs</i>, I say, Mars
Pete! <i>We ain' no free-niggers!</i>"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Lib," returned Newall,
grasping the huge brown hand in his and
shaking it warmly.</p>

<p>Liberty essayed also to keep the rose-garden
and the great oak-studded lawn in order.
But he was soon forced to give that experiment
over; and a gradual though not unlovely
decay set in at Roseneath. Runners
from the climbing vines sprawled over the
winding walks; the grass in summer waved
knee-deep where the smooth-shaven plots
were wont to be, and in the winter rustled
dry and yellow in the bleak wind; the rose-garden
became a tangled thicket of sweets;
the gates sagged, falling away from broken

<!-- page 228 -->

hinges; the rotted roof of the old summer-house
caved in, though the clambering
honeysuckle mercifully hid the wreck. The
house itself took on a stained and weather-beaten
look. Sometimes, when her school
was dismissed and Olive came down into the
rose-garden to pace for a few moments its
deserted paths, she seemed to herself like a
ghost moving about the shadows of a long-gone
but lovely past.</p>

<p>It was about the time her little school
was opened that Olive received a letter from
Duncan Jeffrey. It was in answer to one
written by herself the day she and her father
left Washington on their last journey to
Thornham. She read it, sitting alone in
the disused library; then she came out
upon the gallery where her father lay in
his wheeled chair, and read it aloud to
him.</p>

<p>For, little by little, to the sacred morning
invocation, "<i>Father, I love you. Father,
I know that you did not take Elinor Thornham's
diamonds</i>,"&mdash;she had fallen into the
habit of adding bits of the day's history;
and, finally, of telling him everything as she
had been wont to do in happier days. At
first the sound of her own voice, echoing as

<!-- page 229 -->

it were against a blank wall, was strange in
her own ears, and the sentences would end
in a hushed whisper, oftener in piteous sobs
and a rain of tears. For the glazed eyes
seemed still to see nothing; and the leaden
face was as changeless as the face of the
dead. "But he <i>may</i> hear! He may understand!
Oh, father, does my voice come to
you in your lonely prison? Do you hear
me? Do you love me?"</p>

<p>And so, gradually, as has been said, she
came to sit or stand by him when her day's
duties were ended, or before they began;
and to talk to him in a clear, low, confident
tone, which often brought tears to old Betty's
eyes as she listened.</p>

<p>"Father," she would say caressingly,
"Rufe Drennon has just been here. He
brought a basket of those pink lotus-lilies
which grow in the lake behind Good Luck
Plantation. They are lovely, all pearled
with dew, and their golden stamens trembling." 
Or, "Do you remember Major
Burnham's big bay horse, Otho, papa?
Well, he has bought a perfect match for him.
He drove them out this morning for us to
see." Or, "Mrs. Alsbury says that her
cousin, Martha Damon, whom you will remember,

<!-- page 230 -->

has come to make her a visit. She
has four little girls; the oldest is named
Jeanie Herring, after mamma." Or, "Liberty
went down to Fair View yesterday to
trim the roses on Van's grave. The flood
(you know there was a flood at Fair View
last spring, father, that did some damage?)
does not seem to have injured our burying-ground
at all."</p>

<p>Sometimes, in obedience to something
fluttering within her, like a fledgling bird
trying its wings, she half said, half sung
some rhymes of her own making; or described
a picture which shaped itself in her
brain. Once, when she had been musing
over Young Van's broken life, the tender
pitying thought took shape in this wise:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="small">

<p class="center">PERCY.</p>

<p>My little maid, whose golden hair<br/>

Outglints the warm sunshine,<br/>

Come, round to rosy hollows fair<br/>

Those dimpled palms of thine,<br/>

And send an elfin bugle-blast<br/>

Across the rosy morn,<br/>

To call the bonny blue-eyed lad<br/>

A-hoeing in the corn.</p>

<p>She shakes her head, the little maid;<br/>

He is not there, she saith.<br/>

<!-- page 231 -->

Nay then, where lush green grasses spread<br/>

And summer holds her breath,<br/>

Mayhap he leads the loitering kine;<br/>

Or where the sunbeams steep<br/>

The grassy slopes, and shadows dwine,<br/>

He minds your father's sheep.</p>

<p>She shakes her head, the little maid;<br/>

He is not there, she saith.<br/>

Nay then, fleet-foot and unafraid,<br/>

He speeds across the heath,<br/>

A-chasing of the antlered deer;<br/>

The hounds are following fair;<br/>

His ringing shout I surely hear.<br/>

She saith, he is not there.</p>

<p>She brought me to the wind-swept hill,<br/>

Whose lonesome grasses wave,<br/>

Through summer's heat and winter's chill,<br/>

On many a heaped-up grave.<br/>

And when with trembling tongue I prayed<br/>

The name of one who slept<br/>

Beneath the mound the newest made,<br/>

She answered not, but wept.</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>Duncan's letter was dated at Paris some
weeks earlier.</p>

<p>"I am glad you are at Roseneath," he
wrote, "though I suppose you will soon be
going back to the Capital. It seems far
more natural to think of you in the dear old
home by the riverside, than where I saw
you last, in a strange city and surrounded
by unfamiliar objects.</p>

<!-- page 232 -->

<p>"Tell the Colonel that I fancy he will
half envy me when he learns that I am on
the eve of starting down into South Africa,
where some genuine fighting seems to be
going on. I am already tired of aimless
drifting about, and if you should chance to
hear of me as leading a charge either for or
against some unpronounceable African chief,
do not be surprised."</p>

<p>"Miss Olive," asked Betty, who had listened
attentively to the reading, "is Mars
Duncan projikin' mongs' a passel o' niggers
in Affika, where Unk' Is'om Lester come
from?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid he is," returned her mistress,
laughing a little, but sighing too.</p>

<p>"I sholy thought little Mars Dunc had
mo' 'scretion!" said Betty.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>"I wonder what has become of Rose.
She has not been here for more than a
week."</p>

<p>The short winter was already beginning
to break. Although there yet remained a
full third of February to come, by the almanac,
the air was filled with the scent of
young orange-blossoms, and the elusive perfume
of the sweet-olive. The sky was covered

<!-- page 233 -->

with the soft little drifting clouds which
follow in the wake of a spent "norther."
It was the first time for many weeks that
the wheeled chair, with its heavy and dull
burden, had been brought out upon the open
gallery. Olive, just released from the school
room, was walking slowly up and down near
it, with her hands clasped behind her, bare
headed in the soft sunshine.</p>

<p>Liberty, turning the brown mould with
his spade in a patch beneath the library
windows, was singing. His voice arose
lusty and sweet on the afternoon air:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">" 'F I'd a wife I couldn't please,<br/>

I'd whop her sho's she bawn;<br/>

I'd sen' her down to Nu Orleens,<br/>

An' trade her off fer co'n."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"I wonder what has become of Rose!"</p>

<p>The words reached the singer, who had
paused to take breath, leaning on his spade.
He grunted, muttering something under his
breath about "po'-white trash."</p>

<p>At that moment Rose herself appeared at
the side-gate. She crossed the rose-garden
slowly, looking over her shoulder, and stopping
every now and then as if minded to go
back.</p>

<p>As she neared the steps, however, she

<!-- page 234 -->

broke into a little run, and reached Olive's
side, breathless and smiling.</p>

<p>"Come into the sitting-room, Olive, dear,"
she whispered, with her eyes turned away
from the chair and its occupant. She had
never been able to bring herself to approach
the half-animate thing which had been her
benefactor; quivering with ill-concealed
terror at the mere thought. Olive, at first
deeply pained by this unreasoning and
childish awe, had schooled herself into a
sort of tender indulgence of it, and she now
hastened to follow the trim little figure into
the sitting-room. Rose drew a stool to her
feet when she was seated, and perched herself
daintily upon it.</p>

<p>"Olive," she said, blushing painfully, lifting
her eyes with shy entreaty and instantly
dropping them again, "I have something to
tell you. I&mdash;I&mdash;hope you will not be
angry. I have loved him for a long time.
Oh, from the very first! Olive, I&mdash;I am
going to marry Mr. Kennison."</p>

<p>Olive's heart gave a sudden throb; and a
curious indefinable shade crossed her eyes.</p>

<p>"Dear Rose," she said, gathering the
tearful, smiling little creature into her arms,
"I am so glad. I hope you will be happy,&mdash;I
am sure you will be happy."</p>

<!-- page 235 -->

<p>"Do you know, Olive, darling," Rose
continued, after the long and minute history
of her engagement had been told, and her
rapture had somewhat exhausted itself,&mdash;"do
you know, I thought once&mdash;I was
afraid&mdash;that Mr. Kennison loved you?"</p>

<p>"He never did," Olive said earnestly,
"dear Rose, he never did." And she kissed
again the bright upturned face.</p>

<p>She did not, somehow, tell her father of
Rose's engagement or of her wedding. But
a year later, when Big Hannah brought
little Olive, Rose Kennison's baby, to Roseneath,
she took the dark-eyed mite from
the nurse's arms, and knelt with it beside
him.</p>

<p>"See, papa," she said, "this is our Rose's
baby&mdash;a dear little girl named for me,&mdash;Olive,
Olive Kennison." She smiled a little
as she uttered the name which was to have
been her own. "Our Rose a minister's
wife! think of it! And she is so happy.
And Rufe is so proud. He has refused to
live with them, though. He stays alone at
the old cabin, when he is not loafing, as he
has always done. He was at the back steps
this morning with a bucket of honey for you,
father."</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 236 -->

<div class="center" id="ch13">

<p>XIII.</p>

<p class="small">AN ARRIVAL.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Kennison's rejected love who
pinned on the misty white veil through
which his bride's face looked out at him as
she floated, on her father's arm, up the aisle
of St. John's Church!</p>

<p>Olive accompanied Rose to the church;
awkward shambling Rufe Drennon stubbornly
refusing to sit in the carriage with
them; and there, in the familiar pew, the
woman who was to have been his wife
watched Mark Kennison place the golden
circlet&mdash;emblem of wifehood&mdash;upon
Rose's finger. Little Rose, her own friend
and playmate! She kissed her when the
ceremony was over, and offered him her congratulations
with quiet dignity. Then she
hurried back to her father.</p>

<p>The March wind was blowing with unspring-like
bleakness along the wide river
road.</p>

<p>"It's as cold as a Christian," declared

<!-- page 237 -->

June Badgett, shivering under the Man-Fig.
"An' it's a mighty onlucky day for
a weddin'. I reckin Rufe Drennon'll be
as biggaty as John Thornham his-se'f&mdash;marryin'
his gal to a preacher."</p>

<p>"I sort o' thought, a little more 'n a year
back," said his neighbor, "that the parson
an' Miss Olive Herrin' would make a match
of it. I seen 'em together ever'where."</p>

<p>None of the old group were left except
Badgett himself, and Drennon,&mdash;at that moment
hanging bashfully back from the vestry
at the church, where the bridal party were
signing the register. Even Dud Welsh had
resigned, as it were, from the Man-Fig
Council, having taken to himself a wife
who had incontinently "put her foot down"
on his loafings there.</p>

<p>"Lord," said one of the new squad,
"even a preacher ain't got gall enough to
marry a girl livin' under such a curse."</p>

<p>"What curse?" demanded another&mdash;a
stranger&mdash;curiously.</p>

<p>"Ain't you never heerd about Van Herrin'
and the Hand o' God? Well, I be
dinged! Here, June, tell Joe Collop about
Van"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Shet up," growled Badgett.</p>

<!-- page 238 -->

<p>For the carriage that had conveyed the
bride to the church was passing. In it,
alone, leaning back, pale and thoughtful, sat
Vanborough Herring's daughter. At sight
of her father's old soldier-comrade, she leaned
forward and bowed, an affectionate smile
illuminating her beautiful features.</p>

<p>"Ax somebody else, ef you want to know,"
June continued, turning away. "I'm plum
tired o' tellin' that tale; wish my Maker may
strike me stone dead ef I ain't."</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>The year wore away. The vacation of
the little school came and went, nothing
breaking the dead monotony of the long
summer days, except the visits of the
few friends who remembered that Vanborough
Herring still lived; and pitied, or
loved, his daughter. Olive read much, sitting
by the wheeled chair, often aloud, and
chiefly those books from her father's library
which showed his handling. By these, his
favorites, she came to know him as she had
never known him before,&mdash;the rare, tender,
refined nature thrown back upon itself and
scarce lonelier now in its torpid prison
than when it had been surrounded by a
world of flattering and deceitful parasites.</p>

<!-- page 239 -->

<p>"Oh, had I but seen with keener eyes,
and felt with a less selfish heart," she
sometimes cried out, laying down her book,
after reading a passage marked and annotated
by his hand. And the cry shaped
itself into a bit of rhyme which she often
repeated:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="small">

<p class="center">OH, TO LIVE MY LIFE OVER.</p>

<p>Oh, to live my life over!<br/>

Not to be young again.<br/>

Not to seek peace and pleasantness<br/>

Where I have had tears and pain!<br/>

Not for myself at all, dear Lord,<br/>

Would I live over my life!<br/>

But I would gladly bear its woes once more,<br/>

Its bitter wrongs, and its strife,&mdash;<br/>

If only where I have hurt my own,<br/>

Or failed them in any wise,<br/>

I could repay them for that loss!<br/>

If for tears in their dear eyes,<br/>

I could put smiles; if for pain<br/>

I could give joy&mdash;O God,<br/>

I would tread the burning coals again,<br/>

And pass again under thy rod!</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>One morning in the late fall she sat on
the front gallery, with the invalid's chair
drawn close beside her own. Betty's voice
floated to her at intervals from the kitchen,
where, released by a school holiday from
attendance on her master, she was at work.

<!-- page 240 -->

A letter had come from Jeffrey,&mdash;the first
for many months. It had been long delayed,
and the postmark was illegible. It was
dated, within, from a small town in the heart
of Hindostan.</p>

<br/>

<p>"I have your letter, dear Olive [he said],
in which you tell me that the Colonel has
retired from public life on account of failing 
health. [This, in fact, was what she
had written some months after her father's
stroke; she could not bear at the time to
speak more plainly; and nothing to indicate 
the financial wreck had escaped her.]
I can hardly imagine him inactive, but I
am glad for your sake."</p>

<br/>

<p>An account of various amusing and novel
experiences followed, with a description of
his present locality.</p>

<br/>

<p>"I shall go still farther into the interior,
with my traveling companion, Ballard, who
is a capital fellow [he concluded]. Your
final and decisive answer to the question in
my letter from Cape Town makes it useless
for me to return to America. I should have
no object there except to acquire money;

<!-- page 241 -->

and what use has a drifting nomad like me
for more money than I already possess?
Only I find I cannot persuade myself to sell
Good Luck. I shall hold on to that for the
sake of the day&mdash;long dreamed of!&mdash;when
you sat at the head of my table. My agent
has my instructions, covering several years
at least. And now, dear playmate, friend,
sister, I must say good-by, for the guides are
calling. I shall write when occasion permits,
but I cannot hope to hear from you
soon. God bless you. Do you remember
what I told you about my uncle when I saw
you last? <span class="smcap">Duncan</span>."</p>

<br/>

<p>She laid the letter&mdash;which she did not
read aloud&mdash;upon her knee. Her lips quivered,
and the lonely look in her eyes deepened. 
But making an outward gesture with
her hand, as if putting something away from
her, she leaned closer to the mute form beside
her, and said cheerily: "The sky is
so soft to-day, papa, and so blue. Away
beyond Thornham, which looks as if it were
asleep in the sunshine, there is a dark graying 
cloud that moves upward. I think it
must be the smoke from the Good Luck
sugar-house. The climbing sun strikes upon

<!-- page 242 -->

it, and turns its edges to silver. There is a
harrow-shaped flock of wild geese just this
side of it; we shall hear their honk presently,
for they are coming this way; that means
that we shall have a norther to-morrow.
The river looks like liquid amber; a steamboat
is going by; I can hear the hands singing
on the lower deck. The road by the river-bank
is like a brown crumpled ribbon."</p>

<p>She paused abruptly, and stood up. The
big gate had swung open and two figures&mdash;a
man and a woman&mdash;were advancing
along the leaf-strewn avenue. The woman
was Miss Kizzy. She walked with an assured
tread quite in contrast with her usual
hurried step. She wore the stiff and rustling
black silk gown which was in general
sacred to the Soir&eacute;es given by the Pupils of
the Jolibois Dancing-Academy to their Parents
and Guardians. Her hands were
gloved and a bonnet of the latest pattern
crowned her head. Olive tried vainly to
recognize her companion. He was small
and shrunken; his knees wobbled curiously
as he minced along upon a pair of very
tight, very high-heeled, patent-leather shoes;
a huge pair of mustachios, waxed at the
ends, and suspiciously black, sprung from

<!-- page 243 -->

beneath his prominent nose, giving a grotesquely
fierce look to his brown weazen
face, with its small black eyes, and high
cheek-bones. His dress was correct to jauntiness;
he carried a cane and wore a red rose
on the lappel of his coat. Miss Kizzy's
hand was drawn through his arm, and he
regarded her patronizingly, towering above
him, from time to time.</p>

<p>"Olive," said Miss Kizzy, as her young
friend descended the steps to meet this
strangely assorted pair, "in the gentleman
at my side you behold Monshur d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys."
She spoke with ill-concealed triumph.
"He has returned from a highly successful
Mission to the Foreign Powers. He will
from this time forward reside permanently
in Thornham. Monshur Anatole, this is my
friend, Miss Herring."</p>

<p>Miss Herring stood for a moment speechless
with astonishment. This shriveled and
dried-up old beau the dashing hero of her
childish dreams! This ridiculous figure the
superb young chevalier of the Legion of
Honor, whose deeds had kindled her youthful
imagination! <i>This</i> the&mdash;</p>

<p>Monsieur de Jolibois meanwhile was bowing
before her, hat in hand, so low that the

<!-- page 244 -->

bald and shiny spot on the back of his head
shone at her feet.</p>

<p>"Thees ees an 'ona," he smirked. "I 'ave
h'aspire seense thees morning to encounter
Mees Eereeng. I 'ave absented myself," he
explained when they were seated on the
veranda, "an absence which I r-regr-ret.
An' een zat absence my 'ona has suffered."</p>

<p>Olive started. Had he really heard of
the yellow-fever patient and Miss Kizzy's
flannel? And was there to be bloodshed
after all?</p>

<p>But she was reassured, as he continued
with a grandiloquent wave of his very small,
very white, and bejeweled hand, "<i>Mais oui</i>,
my 'ona has suffered. Madame de Jolibois
has stain ze name of ze <i>famille</i> Jolibois by
condescend to a School of Dance. I blame
you not, <i>ma pauvre petite</i>," he added, gallantly
lifting his wife's hand and imprinting
an airy kiss upon her fingers, "your Anatole
knows not 'ow to cheereesh what you call
<i>maleese</i>. But I 'ave remedy ze w-r-rong,
Mees Eereeng; I 'ave remedy ze w-r-rong.
Ze <i>famille</i> Jolibois cannot be deesgrace by

Anatole de Jolibois, who weell in ze future
'ave ze care of Madame de Jolibois an' ze
<i>aimab</i>' Zeereen<i>a!</i>" He slapped his stiff
shirt-front and looked about him proudly.</p>

<p>Madame de Jolibois was regarding him
with tender admiration.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear Olive," she said, "Monshur
d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys was shocked, as I feared
he would be, by my plebeian occupation.
But he has forgiven me. He has dismissed
the school&mdash;forever. He made a most affecting
discourse to the Pupils. I think
Sarah Hunter wept. You must slip away
from your father, sometimes, child, and come
to see us. Monshur Anatole will enter business
in Thornham. But he will reserve to
himself abundant leisure for less sordid
pursuits."</p>

<p>She rose to go. Monsieur de Jolibois,
after another profound obeisance to Mees
Eereeng, with his hand upon his heart, extended
his arm to his wife.</p>

<p>"I am charm' to return from my voyage,"
he remarked, handing her politely down the
steps. "Ze village of T'ornham is vairy

<!-- page 246 -->

peetoresque; zose little hut by ze rivaire
remind me of <i>la France</i>."</p>

<p>Olive watched them strutting down the
walk together, and then returned to her
father. She related the incident to him,
laughing with girlish glee.</p>

<p>"He looked for all the world like a Jumping-Jack,"
she concluded. "But no matter
how he looks. If dear old Miss Kizzy is
satisfied with him, that is enough. God
bless her for a true and faithful friend!"</p>

<p>The next afternoon, when Newall dropped
in for his daily visit, he brought the news
that Monsieur de Jolibois had absconded&mdash;as
he termed it&mdash;again.</p>

<p>"History has once more repeated itself,"
he said. "The rascal wheedled Miss Kizzy
into taking the whole of her savings from
the bank, and placing them in his hands.
He swaggered around all day yesterday with
his wife on his arm, making calls and talking
in his confounded oily way about entering
business circles in Thornham. This
morning he sneaked away on the train, taking
with him not only all the money belonging
to those two foolish old women, but the
few trinkets which they possessed."</p>

<p>"Poor Miss Kizzy!" exclaimed Olive,
"what will she do?"</p>

<!-- page 247 -->

<p>"Do?" echoed Newall with an amused
chuckle; "Madame de Jolibois, plucky, proud
old soul! has already been around to see
her patrons. She has explained that Monshur
d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys has been called away
on a delicate foreign Diplomatic Mission.
The sign has been replaced above her front
door; and as I came by just now, Miss
'Fatty' was thumping away on the piano,
and I heard Sarah Hunter's voice. The
Jolibois Dancing-Academy is once more in
full blast!"</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>The following year&mdash;the third after the
awful dispensation which condemned Vanborough
Herring to a living death, and his
daughter to poverty and toil, there were two
happenings which disturbed the unvarying
quiet of Roseneath.</p>

<p>For Olive and her father, with the two
faithful old servitors, were still at Roseneath.
The times were dull and hard, and buyers
of property, anywhere, were rare. Few outsiders
seeking homes were attracted to the
lagging old town; and these had no mind
to add to the purchase-money the enormous
expense for repairs necessary to the decaying
old mansion and its grounds. The owner

<!-- page 248 -->

wrote occasionally to Newall, but in the
main, absorbed in other things, troubled
himself very little about this out-of-the-way
piece of property. Olive, meanwhile, managed,
out of her slender earnings, to pay a
nominal rent, and when she anxiously suggested
the advisability of finding another
house, "Not yet," Newall invariably replied,
"not yet." He well knew what a wrench
it would be to her to remove her father from
this sacred retreat which <i>in life</i> he had so
loved. There was, besides, a secret and unconfessed
pleasure to himself in seeing Elinor
Thornham's kinswoman and radiant likeness
flit about the house which had once
been hers. And so they stayed on, Olive's
school flourishing in the same sober and conservative
fashion in which for above twenty-five
years had flourished the Jolibois Dancing-Academy.</p>

<p>In the spring of that third year Kennison's
young wife sickened and died. Her
brief and happy married life ended quite
suddenly. Two days before her death she
danced like a sunbeam about the rectory-garden,
calling gayly to her husband through
his study-window, and showering rose-leaves
upon little Olive's bright head.</p>

<!-- page 249 -->

<p>The news came with a painful shock to
Olive Herring.</p>

<p>"Dear Rose," she sobbed, standing beside
the coffin in the dim church, with the two-year-old
motherless child in her arms, and
Rufe Drennon, sluggish in his grief as in
his joy, beside her; "dear sweet little Rose!
How could Death have the heart to touch
your golden head! But at least your life
has been happy and free of care!"</p>

<p>It was true. By a strange perversity of
fate, the indolent, dependent, affectionate
daughter of the shiftless poor-white had
been shielded like a hothouse flower from
every wind that blew, while the child of her
powerful and aristocratic benefactor had
been exposed to the merciless fury of the
tempest. Poor and obscure, she had never
known the pangs of poverty, or suffered for
want of tender companionship. Her healthy
body had rarely felt pain; her careless heart
had been untouched by grief or disappointment.
Unaware of her danger to the last,
she died with a ripple of infantine laughter
on her lips. Putting her into the grave was
like turning the mould over a bright-winged
humming-bird: or a half-blown rose whose
petals are pearled with morning dew.</p>

<!-- page 250 -->

<p>Thereafter, daily, like her mother before
her, little Olive, in the arms of Big Hannah,
came up to Roseneath. Unlike her mother
the child felt no terror of the silent rigid
figure on the couch, or in the wheeled chair.
She nestled against it with strange confidence,
lifting a tiny hand to touch the pallid
cheek, or to smooth back the falling gray
locks. Her first words, in a smiling effort
to imitate Olive, whom she adored, were
"<i>I wuv oo, faver, I wuv oo</i>."</p>

<p>Following hard upon Rose's death came
an incident which disturbed in many ways
the tranquil if mournful life at Roseneath.
Olive sat one day beside her father in the
habitual gallery-nook. Rose's baby, cooing
and babbling, played at her feet; Big Hannah
looking on from the steps where she sat,
idle and good-natured.</p>

<p>There was a rush of footsteps around the
corner of the house, and Betty appeared,
breathless, and ashen with fright.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Olive, honey," she shouted,
"come quick, an' he'p me find some linen-truck
fer de doctor. Lib's done broke his
laig!"</p>

<p>XIV.</p>

<p class="small">THE DRUM-MAJOR'S LEG.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> proved to be worse than a broken leg.
A tree which Liberty was engaged in cutting
down in a corner of the stable-yard had toppled
unexpectedly and fallen upon him, injuring
his back and crushing his right leg
into a bruised and quivering mass. Some
passers-by, attracted by his cries, had
brought him in. An immediate operation
was found to be necessary, and the leg was
amputated just above the knee.</p>

<p>The stay and prop of the forlorn little
household seemed suddenly removed. For
the first time since her father's affliction
Olive's fortitude gave way. She bent over
the rugged black face on the pillow in
Betty's cabin and sobbed aloud. Feeling
her tears upon his face the negro opened his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Lawd, chile," he said, reaching out a
big horny hand and patting her head tenderly,
"don' cry, don' cry! I ain' much

<!-- page 252 -->

hu't. I'm gwine to be ez spry ez ever, soon
ez Doct' Alsbury gits thro' projickin' wi' my
laig."</p>

<p>Still dazed by the chloroform, he did not
know that his leg had been cut off.</p>

<p>This was too much for Betty, and she fled,
weeping, into the yard.</p>

<p>The next morning, she hurried distractedly
to the cabin from the great-house, where
she and the young mistress together had
made Herring's toilet, sorely missing Liberty's
strong arms and gentle touch. She
found her husband groaning loudly, or, to
speak more accurately, roaring like a
wounded lion.</p>

<p>"Gawd-a-mighty! What's de matter?
What's de matter?" she demanded, trembling
with apprehension.</p>

<p>"Hush, 'ooman," replied Liberty, "I'm
honorin' my sickness. Ef I don't honor my
sickness, <i>who's gwine to honor it?</i>"</p>

<p>But this was a pretext, as he presently
confessed.</p>

<p>"Betty," he said piteously, "in course I
hates to lose my laig, an' seem-like I can't
stan' de wrenchin' misery in my back. But
it ain' dat, gal, it ain' dat! What, in de
name o' Gawd, is gwine to become o' Mars

<!-- page 253 -->

Van an' Miss Olive now? Dat chile workin'
herse'f to de bone, teachni' o' dem bowdacious
chillun; an' Lib a-layin' like a ole log
in de bed! No mo' garden-patch! no mo'
tater-patch! no mo' co'n-patch! Who
gwine ter lif' Mars Van, an' dress him, an'
feed him? Who gwine&mdash;<i>O Lawd!</i>"</p>

<p>Betty's face twitched, but she answered
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Don' fret yo'se'f, Lib. Big Hannah's
my chile. I fotch her inter de world; an'
ef she don' b'long to me I don' know who
she <i>do</i> b'long to! She's mighty triflin'
sence she tuck to nussin'. But she's ez
strong ez a sugar-mule. I done laid down
de law to Big Hannah. She's got to come
fum Mist' Kennison's soon enough in de
mawnin's to lif' Mars Van, an' he'p me dress
him. Ef she don't I'll wear her to a frazzle!"</p>

<p>Liberty laughed among his pillows.</p>

<p>"Big Hannah's got de strenk, Betty; she
got her strenk fum me. But who gwine
to <i>feed</i> Big Hannah? She kin <i>eat</i> like a
sugar-mule, too."</p>

<p>Betty soothed this anxiety as best she
could, and went back to the house.</p>

<p>In the new order of things Olive's cares

<!-- page 254 -->

seemed doubled. She realized more and
more how she had depended upon her major-domo's
great faithful heart and strong willing
arms. She wished to have him removed
to the house, where he would be more
within reach, and less alone. But he objected.</p>

<p>"No, Miss Olive," he said with dignity,
"I'm better off in ou' cabin. Besides," and
his eyes twinkled, "I'd ruther be where I
can honor my sickness, d'out sturbin' you
an' Mars Van."</p>

<p>As soon as he was able to sit up in bed,
he sent for one of his boys, a lad who
tended Major Burnham's horses, and gave
him some instructions. A day or two later
Olive found the bed strewn with withes of
white-oak. Liberty, propped up among his
pillows, was weaving baskets to sell.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there was quite a little flutter
among Liberty's white friends, for his patient
and unselfish devotion to his former
owner in his misfortunes had won him
many. This was no less than a project,
originating with Madame de Jolibois, to
buy him an artificial leg.</p>

<p>"One in the very latest style," Miss Kizzy
explained to Newall, sitting in his office.

<!-- page 255 -->

"I learned from Sarah Hunter, whose uncle-in-law
lost his limb at the Battle of Shiloh,"
she went on, "that for a sum which I confess
seems large, Peter, these artificial limbs
may be procured in the North. I am at
present in correspondence with a firm in
Philadelphia. In fact, I am negotiating for
a second-hand limb"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Second-hand!" gasped Newall.</p>

<p>"Second-hand," repeated Miss Kizzy
firmly. "The limb, which corresponds to
Liberty Thornham's proportions, was made,
it appears, for a drum-major who lost his
limb in a battle during our war. I do not
know what battle, for I regret to say that
the drum-major was in the Yankee army.
I feel that I ought to offer an apology to
the people of Thornham for having decided
upon buying&mdash;if the money can be raised&mdash;a
limb which has been worn by one of
our enemies. But being second-hand (for
the drum-major, they inform me, returned
it after using it about a year),&mdash;<i>being</i>
second-hand, I get it at half-price."</p>

<p>"How much money have you on hand?"
Newall asked, taking out his purse.</p>

<p>"The fund, Peter, amounts as yet to
only a few dollars," she returned. "But

<!-- page 256 -->

several people have promised to subscribe,
and there will be mite-meetings, in Mrs.
Alsbury's yard and elsewhere, for the benefit
of the fund. Were it not for the unavoidable
expense of Monshur d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys' trip
I could do more myself. Liberty has been
informed of this movement. But of course
we do not wish Olive to know as yet," she
added anxiously.</p>

<p>"You are a good woman, Keziah," Newall
said, doubling his subscription, which he
could ill afford at the moment, "and if ever
a man in this world has done his duty, that
man is Lib Thornham."</p>

<p>Madame de Jolibois went away radiant.
The fund under her indefatigable generalship
grew; but it grew slowly. Sixty
dollars was a large sum to raise for such a
purpose; and it was a full year before the
drum-major's leg came, consigned to Madame
de Jolibois.</p>

<p>Long before this Liberty had contrived
a pair of crutches strong enough to bear his
immense weight.</p>

<p>"I kin werry along wi' dese ontell I git
de dum-major's laig," he said to Betty, regarding
them with just pride.</p>

<p>He swung himself on them to the great-house

<!-- page 257 -->

every morning to superintend his
master's toilet. Big Hannah and her
charge arrived promptly from the rectory
at the same hour. Kennison, in his untidy
and silent home, was pleased to have his
child under Miss Herring's guardianship.</p>

<p>Big Hannah's duties in the sick-room
completed, with what assistance he could
give, Liberty then assumed charge of the
invalid and the child; seating himself in a
split-bottomed chair brought over from the
cabin, and setting about his basket-weaving;
while his daughter, obediently though not
with alacrity, trudged out into the garden-patch.</p>

<p>"Neb' mine, Miss Olive," he said in answer 
to the expostulations of his mistress,
"neb' mine; Mist' Kennison hiahs Big
Hannah to nuss his chile. Big Hannah's a
mighty po' nuss. I kin tek keer o' de chile
a heap better 'n she kin. At de same
time Big Hannah ain' los' her laig, an' she
kin drive a spade an' han'l a hoe better 'n
<i>I</i> kin. Ef I kin nuss better 'n Big Hannah,
Mist' Kennison ain' got no call to complain!"</p>

<p>"But how about Big Hannah?" his mistress
asked.</p>

<!-- page 258 -->

<p>"Lawd, Miss Olive, Big Hannah ain'
complainin'! But ef she dassen to open
her mouth, her mammy's got strenk 'nuff to
wear her to a frazzle!"</p>

<p>The long-expected leg arrived at last.
Doctor Alsbury fetched the box over in his
buggy and assisted at the unpacking. Liberty
examined the straps and buckles with
staring eyes, and hugged the somewhat battered
leg (the drum-major had evidently
been in the habit of using it as a projectile!)
to his bosom with loud hallelujahs.
But he broke down and cried like a child
when he found that he could not wear it,
try as he would.</p>

<p>"Hit ain' no use, Miss Olive," he said
dejectedly. "Dat dum-major's laig don'
seem to fit, no matter how me an' Betty
ties an' onties dem strops. Seem-like dat
Yankee dum-major has <i>hoodooed</i> dat laig,
anyhow!"</p>

<p>He stood it up against the foot of the
four-post bed in his cabin, regarding it with
a mixture of awe and admiration as he went
in and out; and occasionally he tried it on.</p>

<p>"Dem Philadelphy folks ain' got much
jedgment, nohow," he finally concluded, philosophically
whittling out a new crutch.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 259 -->

<p>XV.</p>

<p class="small">RELEASE.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> prison is without a door, and sooner
or later, in one way or another, every captive
escapes from bondage.</p>

<p>So it was at last with Vanborough Herring.</p>

<p>The time was spring,&mdash;a little more than
five years from the day the soul was thrust
into its donjon-cell. His daughter was
standing beside him; Rose's child was pattering
about the sunny gallery; Liberty sat
on the steps with his crutches beside him
watching Big Hannah spade the lettuce-bed
below; the voices of the school-children at
their noon play on the front lawn blended
pleasantly with the plantation hymn Betty
was singing over her wash-tubs.</p>

<p>"Do you know, father," Olive was saying
lightly, "I had a curious dream last night.
I thought I saw mother and Van come across
the rose-garden hand in hand. They called
to me, and I ran out to where they were.

<!-- page 260 -->

And all at once we were all back in the
'other house,' and you had little Jeanie in
your arms. And then"&mdash;she paused and
stooped to kiss his forehead, but started
back with a cry. A quiver was running
along his limbs; his ashen face was purpling.
Oh, God in Heaven, was it life coming
back?</p>

<p>No, not life! Death had opened the door,
and the prisoner was free!</p>

<p>The daughter's grief was terrible. It was
utterly incomprehensible to those who for
years had been saying to each other how
much better for him, and for her, if he could
only die; even Newall wondered at it. Only
Betty, gathering her nursling in her arms
and weeping with her, could understand the
sudden void, the aching loneliness in the
heart throbbing so painfully against her
own.</p>

<P>"Yes, honey," she said soothingly, "Maum
knows. It's like losin' a baby. My ole
arms is achin' yit a'ter my fust little gal, an'
she been onder groun' mo' 'n thirty year."</P>

<p>"If he could have spoken to me,&mdash;just
once before he left me, Maum Betty! If he
could have given me one look! If he could
only have known <i>truly</i> that I did not believe"&mdash;

<!-- page 261 -->

And here there was an added
pang, which Betty's mother-heart&mdash;knowing
nothing&mdash;yet dimly divined. She pressed
the tear-stained face closer to her bosom.</p>

<p>"Ez to <i>knowin</i>', honey," she whispered,
"don' trebble 'bout dat; Mars Van knowed
it all 'fo' he went. Ef he didn' he sholy
knows it all now."</p>

<p>He looked, lying in his coffin, with the
quiet majesty of death upon his marble face,&mdash;the
face which had settled back into the
beautiful and regular outlines so well remembered
by those who knew him best,&mdash;he
looked as if he might in truth know all.
The smile hovering about the closed lips
was one of triumph.</p>

<p>"<i>A Vanborough! Impossible!</i>" John
Thornham's hot words leaped back into
Newall's mind as he stood looking down
upon the dead man.</p>

<p>"Impossible, indeed," he murmured.
"Whatever secret Vanborough Herring is
carrying to his grave, it is not one of dishonor!"</p>

<p>They buried him in the Thornham family
burying-ground at Fair View. The shadow
of the stone at Young Van's head fell
athwart the grave as they lowered the

<!-- page 262 -->

casket beside the mouldering coffins, already
placed there, of his wife and two little children.</p>

<p>It was not the Rector of St. John's who
read the burial-service over the dead, but
Father Dalton, the superannuated old Methodist
preacher, who had known him when
he was a little lad in Kentucky. He recalled
this fact in his homely and familiar discourse,
and spoke at some length of certain
traits of character in the boy which had developed
nobly in the man; he dwelt upon
the kindness and generosity which had always
distinguished him as a friend and as a
citizen; and referred to his secret benefactions,&mdash;and
at this some among his listeners
winced.</p>

<p>"And now, my brethren," concluded the
old man, looking somewhat sternly around
upon the large crowd of people, who from
various motives had followed the dead man
to his last resting-place, "I say unto you,
beware lest in your foolish judgment you
mistake the wisdom of the Almighty. Whom
He <i>loveth</i> He chasteneth. A blessing oftentimes
hath the outer shape and disfigurement
of a curse. Was not the Hand of God
heavy also upon his servant Job?"</p>

<!-- page 263 -->

<p>The sun had set, and the sudden shadows
of nightfall descended even as he spoke.
In the hush that followed his words, the
outer circle of hearers,&mdash;the negroes who
had once called Vanborough Herring master,&mdash;gathered
together under Liberty's leadership,
broke into a mournful hymn, which
yet had in its refrain a ringing undercurrent
of exultation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"I traveled fur an' I traveled fas',<br/>

<i>Mo'nin', O good Lawd, mo'nin'</i>.<br/>

Night-time come an' I drapped at las',<br/>

<i>Mo'nin', O good Lawd, mo'nin'</i>.<br/>

Now in de mawnin' I open my eyes&mdash;<br/>

<i>Shoutin', O good Lawd, shoutin'</i>&mdash;<br/>

In de shiny mountains o' Paradise;<br/>

<i>Shoutin', O good Lawd, shoutin'</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>"I would like to remain a few days longer
at Roseneath," Olive said, talking over her
plans later with Newall. For the time was
indeed come when she must leave Roseneath.</p>

<p>He nodded abstractedly. It was plain
that his thoughts were elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Of course I shall keep my school," she
continued, "not only for my own support
and that of dear faithful Maum Betty and
Lib, but to save me from utter loneliness."</p>

<!-- page 264 -->

<p>"Olive," said her companion abruptly,
"have I not by this time something like a
father's right to take care of you?"</p>

<p>"Dear friend," she replied, pressing her
lips to his hand which she held in hers,
"you have always the right to love me, and
advise me, and comfort me. Nay, more,"
and she smiled a little wistfully up into his
face, "you have the right to scold me, too,
whenever you like. But a great healthy
young woman like myself to sit quietly down
to be taken care of! For shame, Mr. Peter
Newall! You should not encourage such
idleness."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear," he sighed, disappointed,
"it must be as you wish, I suppose. But I
have your promise to come to me when you
need anything. Certainly you must stay on
here as long as you wish. It will take some
time to set the smaller house we have rented
in order. But I fear you will be very
lonely."</p>

<p>She was lonely. Yet, as the long summer
days drifted by and the time approached
for the inevitable change,&mdash;the dismantling
of the old familiar rooms, the gathering together 
of personal belongings, the removal to
a strange house,&mdash;she clung more and more,

<!-- page 265 -->

with a frightened sort of feeling, to the very
loneliness and desolation about her.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>Kennison was sitting beside his study-table.
The August noontide was stiflingly
hot; the lifeless air in the small room was
heavy with the perfume of the cape jessamines
in the garden outside,&mdash;the perfume
which always reminded him of Rose's coffin,
which had been smothered under them.
He pushed back his chair impatiently and
threw down his pen, leaning back at the
same time to draw the dingy curtains across
the open window.</p>

<p>The Rector of St. John's was looking
gaunt and worn. He was barely thirty
years of age, but he had long lost all semblance
of youth. People said it was the
climate and the death of his young wife.
His dark eyes were strangely sunken; his
hair was quite gray; there were deep wrinkles
on his forehead and around the drooping
corners of his mouth. His sad and overwearied
air was in harmony with the lonely shabbiness
of his surroundings. During the two
years of his widowhood things had gone
pretty much as they pleased at the rectory;
now the older women of the congregation

<!-- page 266 -->

were beginning to say that the rector ought
to look about him for a "suitable" mother
for his child.</p>

<p>He got up and walked listlessly to the
door. There was a rattle of wheels in the
street, which ceased abruptly; and Doctor
Alsbury called from the gate,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good-day, parson. I brought your mail
over,&mdash;a couple of letters and some newspapers."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Alsbury." He came out
and stood by the buggy.</p>

<p>"You look fagged out, Mr. Kennison,"
continued the doctor. "Jump in and drive
about with me a little. It is pretty hot, but
the open air will do you good. I am going
down to Rufe Drennon's ca&mdash;house. He's
been laid up for a week and I have not
seen him since the day before yesterday."</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked Kennison.</p>

<p>If Rufe Drennon had not been the rector's
father-in-law, the doctor would probably
have characterized the attack as "pure
laziness;" as it was, however, he replied
carelessly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing in particular; seems to be
a little feverish, and complains of headache.
He'll pull up in a day or two."</p>

<!-- page 267 -->

<p>Kennison called Big Hannah,&mdash;for, for
once in a way, little Olive and her nurse
had elected to spend a part of the day at
home,&mdash;and gave her some directions. Then
he stepped into the buggy and they turned
down the dusty but well-shaded lane that led
to the outskirts of the town.</p>

<p>Drennon's cabin stood in the midst of a
small field which at present was a tangle of
sunflowers and cockle-burrs. It was built
of logs, and in its day and time had been a
comfortable dwelling-place. There were two
rooms, with a wide open passage-way between
them, and a couple of shed-rooms in
the rear. But the chimney, straining away
from the end wall, seemed on the eve of
tumbling to the ground; the roof drooped
under the weight of rotting shingles; the
floor of the passage-way was broken in many
places; it looked as shiftless and dilapidated
as Drennon himself.</p>

<p>They found him lying on an unkempt bed
in one of the shed-rooms. There seemed to
be no one else on the premises. A pitcher
of water was set on the floor within his
reach; an ill-smelling lamp on a shelf above
the head of the bed was still burning, its
flame looking strangely forlorn in the sunlight

<!-- page 268 -->

which streamed in through the open
door.</p>

<p>The moment the doctor's practiced eye
fell upon his patient, his countenance
changed; his careless expression gave place
to grave anxiety. He laid his hand on the
brown hairy wrist stretched along the soiled
coverlet and felt the pulse. Drennon looked
at him with dull curiosity.</p>

<p>"Well, Doc," he said in a husky whisper,
"I reckin my time's come, ain't it?"</p>

<p>The physician did not reply; he was
hastily mixing some brandy and water in a
cracked teacup.</p>

<p>"Swallow this, Rufe," he said, slipping
his arm under the pillow, and lifting the
sick man's shoulders.</p>

<p>But Drennon moved his head aside fretfully.</p>

<p>" 'Tain't no use, Doc," he said, "my
time's come. I've had innard fever off 'n'
on fer mo' 'n six months; an' sence I've
been layin' here, I've felt somep'n snap
som'ers inside me. An' I don' keer. I'm
plum tired anyhow. I never did keer much,"
he rambled on, his voice now stronger, now
sinking into a faint monotone, "cep'n fer
Rosy; Rosy's things is all in them two front

<!-- page 269 -->

rooms. She fixed 'em up herse'f,&mdash;them
two front rooms. I ain' never onsettled
'em sence she lef'."</p>

<p>Kennison looked at the doctor, who had
seated himself on the side of the bed after
forcing a swallow of brandy down Drennon's
throat, and was softly chafing one of
his hands.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" he asked in an
undertone.</p>

<p>Alsbury shook his head.</p>

<p>"Death," he replied briefly. "A sudden
collapse. There is no possible hope. He
is dying."</p>

<p>"I know it," said Drennon, opening his
eyes, for he had sunk into an uneasy slumber;
"an' I don't keer. But afore I die I
want to tell about them di'mon's."</p>

<p>"What diamonds?" demanded Alsbury,
warning Kennison with a glance not to
speak.</p>

<p>"It was this-a-way, Doc," continued the
sick man with a slight show of eagerness.
"I useter sell things to Miss Elinor,&mdash;you
<i>know</i>,&mdash;fresh eggs, an' blackberries, an' figs,
an' sech. An' that night I tuk a basket o' figs
to Roseneath, 'cause I heerd she'd been
a-honin' a'ter figs. I went late, 'cause Rosy

<!-- page 270 -->

was afeerd to stay by herse'f, an' I had to
wait ontell she was asleep,&mdash;po' little
Rosy!"</p>

<p>"Well?" said the doctor, again motioning
to Kennison to keep out of sight.</p>

<p>"Well, I come 'crost the rose-gyarden
without seein' a soul, an' I started to go
roun' to the front do'. But all at onct, I
heerd Van Herrin's voice inside, an' I crope
back an' tuk off my shoes, an' went up on
the side-gall'ry to the winder. He was in
the settin'-room with Miss Elinor. They
had done quit talkin' an' he was standin' by
her. She was a-layin' on the lounge. I
reckin he was tellin' her good-by. They
useter be sweethearts, Miss Elinor an' Van.
He started to go an' she called him back an'
showed him a box. I seen her open it. He
took it an' looked at somep'n inside it. Then
he laid it down on the table, an' stooped
over an' kissed her onct. Then he opened
the blind, an' come out'n the winder, an'
jumped down fum the gall'ry, an' went
'crost to the rose-gyarden gate. Ef he had
looked 'roun', he might of seen me. But
he didn't. I heerd June Badgett hollerin'
to them mules of his'n out in the road, an'
I waited ontell he got by; an' then I

<!-- page 271 -->

knocked on the winder, an' went in with my
basket. I wa'n't thinkin' o' nothin' but sellin'
them figs an' gittin' back to Rosy. But
Miss Elinor's eyes were shet; an' I seen she
was asleep. She wa'n't dead; she was
sleepin' like a baby. I wouldn't of done
it ef she had been dead. That box was
layin' where Van Herrin' had put it, an' I
took it an' put it in my pocket, an' crope
back, an' got my shoes, an' come home. An'
nex' mornin' I heerd that Miss Elinor was
dead."</p>

<p>Kennison could restrain himself no longer.</p>

<p>"What!" he thundered, "<i>you</i> were the
thief! <i>You</i> took those diamonds! and all
these years you have allowed an innocent
man to suffer for your crime!"</p>

<p>"You neenter holler so loud, parson,"
said Drennon peevishly. "I ain't deef."</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, Mr. Kennison,"
urged the doctor, "be quiet. The man
is sinking rapidly. Let him finish his
story."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he put the brandy and water
again to his patient's lips.</p>

<p>"I don' want no medicine, Doc," whispered
Drennon. "Don't you be skeered.
I ain't goin' to die ontell I git good an'

<!-- page 272 -->

ready! Ef the law had a-tuk up the case,
I'd of come forrard quick enough. Or ef
Johnny Thornham had of prosecuted, I
wouldn't of let the law tech him. But I
knowed no Thornham wa'n't goin' to prosecute
no other Thornham! Onct I had 'em
in my pocket when I tuk Mis' Herrin' some
truck she ast me to git her out'n the woods.
But I didn't git no chance to give 'em to
her. An' when she tuk Rosy an' was so
good to her, I didn' dassen to give 'em to
her, less'n she'd turn Rosy out. <i>I</i> didn'
want 'em. They wa'n't no manner o' use to
me. When Van Herrin' was struck, Doc,
I kep' tellin' that fool June Badgett not to
be so blame shore about the Hand o' God!
When Van got struck I useter take Miss
Olive ever' nice thing I got a holt of&mdash;peaches,
an' honey, an' eggs, an' flowers. I
didn' want no pay fer 'em. But she
wouldn' take nothin' without pay. Them
Thornhams is mighty biggaty! Anyhow, I
never spent none o' that money. I've got
it all&mdash;ever' blame cent."</p>

<p>He felt feebly under his pillow and
brought out a little blue calico bag, and emptied
its contents&mdash;a handful of silver dimes
and quarter-dollars&mdash;on the coverlet.</p>

<!-- page 273 -->

<p>"Ever' cent Mis' Herrin' ever give me, an'
ever' cent Miss Olive ever give me; Doc, I
want you to give it to Miss Olive."</p>

<p>"I will, Rufe," said Alsbury. "But what
became of the diamonds, Rufe? Have you
got them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I've got 'em. I've jest had to
keep 'em. <i>I</i> didn' want 'em. The Lord
knows they wa'n't no good to me. But I
had to keep 'em. I useter lock 'em in the
cupboard, but I fetched 'em to bed with me
yistiddy, because I knowed my time had
come. An' I don't keer. Tek 'em, Doc.
An' that's all I got to say."</p>

<p>The dying man felt under the pillow again
and thrust into the doctor's hand a small
leather case; then closed his eyes, and
turned upon the pillow as if addressing himself
to sleep. He did, in fact, fall asleep
almost instantly, breathing at first heavily,
then more softly, and finally, flutteringly,
and at long intervals. Doctor Alsbury, with
the little jewel-box in one hand, and the
other upon the sleeping man's wrist, sat perfectly
silent for a long time; the shaft of
sunlight that fell across the floor receded
steadily; the breeze freshened a little; the
afternoon was waning. At length he leaned

<!-- page 274 -->

forward with a sigh and drew the covering
over the haggard face on the pillow.</p>

<p>"He is dead," he said gently. "Poor
Rufe!"</p>

<p>Kennison, who sat stunned and motionless
in a corner,&mdash;all thought of his calling
clean gone out of his mind,&mdash;looked up at
the sound of his voice; then arose and came
forward, staggering like a drunken man.
The doctor also arose, opening, as he
did so, the little casket. It contained an
old-fashioned necklet,&mdash;a slender thread of
twisted gold; the heart-shaped pendant that
hung upon it was set with two or three small
and insignificant stones. On a yellowed slip
of paper in the box were the words, "<i>For
little Olive</i>," in a woman's handwriting.</p>

<p>A spasm distorted Kennison's pale face&mdash;of
rage against the dull clod, forever beyond
his reach, lying at peace upon the
sordid bed? Of shame at the recollection
of his own cowardice? Of self-pity? He
could not himself have defined the feeling
which overwhelmed him. He took the box
from Alsbury's hands, and looked at it.</p>

<p>"<i>Elinor Thornham's diamonds!</i>" The
words burst from him in a hot resistless
flood. "The priceless necklet!" he sneered.

<!-- page 275 -->

"Priceless indeed! An honorable name for
its sake dragged in the mire; an innocent
man hounded to his grave; a happy family
destroyed! Ay, and more, by Heaven! A
young and tender creature tortured by a
coward&mdash;a brute"&mdash;</p>

<p>He checked himself suddenly and rushed
from the cabin, and across the field to where
the horse and buggy had been left in the
shade of a live-oak. Untying the lines with
mad haste, he sprang into the buggy and
drove away, deaf to the amazed halloo of
the doctor, who stood in the door of the
cabin, gazing after him, apprehensive for
his reason. He drove furiously, lashing the
old horse into a foam, until he reached Roseneath.</p>

<p>There he alighted and walked rapidly
across the grounds, and entered the house
by the familiar side-hall. Olive was in the
little sitting-room. She sat by the window
with her hands folded idly in her lap, and
her dreamy eyes turned toward the garden.
At the sound of footsteps she looked
up.</p>

<p>Kennison was standing, wild-eyed and haggard,
on the threshold.</p>

<p>"Miss Herring," he said, in a loud unnatural

<!-- page 276 -->

voice, "I wish&mdash;I must speak with
you."</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>"Little Olive! Oh, what has happened
to her?" she cried, growing pale.</p>

<p>"The child is well," he returned, advancing
until he stood directly in front of her.
"It is not of little Olive that I have to
speak." He faced her a moment in silence
as if trying to collect his thoughts, then he
went on: "I have this moment come from
the death-bed of Rose's father&mdash;of Rufus
Drennon, my father-in-law. No, do not
interrupt me," he said, as she made a gesture
of sympathy.</p>

<p>"Miss Herring&mdash;Olive&mdash;the last time I
was in this room I stood where I now stand,
and told you the story of your father's crime&mdash;wait,"
for she had drawn herself up
proudly, and was pointing to the door,&mdash;"wait,
I beseech you, and hear me out. I
told you what people were saying of his
disgrace and his shame. I told you that I
thought it my duty, as a servant before
God's altar, to break the troth which hardly
twenty-four hours earlier I had plighted to
you. I told you that I could not ally myself
with a family upon which such a stain

<!-- page 277 -->

rested; I could not marry a woman whose
father was a criminal though unpunished;
a thief though free from the clutches of the
law. Wait, I beg of you! I told you all
this, standing where I now stand, and looking,
as I now look, in the face of your father's
daughter. Well, I come to you, now, to
tell you that I&mdash;the proud, the virtuous,
the lofty-minded man and minister of God,
who would not contaminate himself by taking
in his your innocent white hand; I, the
despicable coward; I&mdash;Mark Kennison&mdash;<i>I</i>
married the daughter of the real thief;
my wife was the child of the man who stole
Elinor Thornham's diamonds."</p>

<p>Olive, who had listened, spell-bound, recoiled
at the last words.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she gasped, pale
to the very lips. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>She almost shrieked the words, catching
him unconsciously by the wrists.</p>

<p>"I mean"&mdash;he spoke more slowly, for
he was beginning to feel weak and exhausted&mdash;"I
mean that your father lived
and died an innocent man&mdash;unjustly accused,
foully slandered. I mean that Rufus
Drennon, my wife's father, has confessed
with his dying breath that it was he who

<!-- page 278 -->

committed the crime for which your father
has been branded in this community for
nearly twenty years"&mdash;</p>

<p>He caught her in his arms; for the room
whirled about her, and she could no longer
stand. Her white glorified face rested a
moment on his breast.</p>

<p>"O God, I thank Thee!" she murmured
in ecstasy. "Father, Father!"</p>

<p>He waited until the flow of happy tears
allowed her again to listen. Then, word for
word, he took up the story as Drennon had
told it; as it had burnt itself into his brain!
His lips were dry and parched and his tongue
almost refused to obey his will as he repeated
mechanically the uncouth phrases of
the dying man.</p>

<p>"Oh," she cried, putting out a hand to
stay him, "in pity do not tell me any more!
It is enough for me to know that my father's
honor is vindicated."</p>

<p>"I must," he groaned, "I must!"</p>

<p>And when he had finished, he took the
paltry casket from his breast-pocket, and
laid it on the table beside her. Then he
went away.</p>

<p>She snatched up the box as soon as he
had left her, and ran out into the yard, crying:&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 279 -->

<p>"Liberty! <i>Liberty!</i> Maum Betty, where
are you?"</p>

<p>"What in de name o' Gawd is de matter
wi' de chile!" said the old man, sitting up
in bed; for he was resting his tired back.
"Soun's like she got somep'n on her
min'!"</p>

<p>"No it don't!" cried Betty, running to
the door, "it soun's like she's got religion!
What is it, honey?"</p>

<p>Olive, panting and happy, threw herself
into her nurse's outstretched arms; then
she flew to the bedside.</p>

<p>"O Liberty," she sobbed, "it was not
true! It was never true! I knew he never
could have done it! O <i>father! father!</i>"</p>

<p>The old people stared at each other, mystified.
She poured out the glad tidings,
laughing and crying in the same breath.</p>

<p>"And after all," she concluded, "the necklet
was mine! My cousin Elinor must have
intended him to take it away with him!
See, Maum, here is my name on the card&mdash;<i>for
little Olive</i>."</p>

<p>"Lawd, is <i>dem</i> de di'mon's dat made all
de splutter<i>ment?</i>" asked Lib, contemptuously
eying the old-fashioned ornament.
"Hmp! Ef Mars Van been in de <i>way</i> o'

<!-- page 280 -->

stealin', he sholy would ha' tuk somep'n better'n
dem glass beads! Yes, chile, I has
always knowed dat monsus lie 'bout Mars
Van&mdash;me an' Betty bofe. I mashed de
mouth o' de free-nigger dat had de insu'ance
to tell us! In cose, Miss Olive, I
knowed Mars Van was wi' Miss Elinor dat
night, 'caze I tuk de note to his office axin'
him to come. She tole me to keep de yuthers
out'n de way. Seem-like she sort o' shame
to let anybody but me know dat she saunt
fer Mars Van. Anyhow, when all dat
human-cry riz up 'bout dem di'mon's, I kep'
my mouth shet. 'Caze I knowed Mars Van
had been wi' Miss Elinor. <i>An' ef Betty's
Marster wanted to tote off a passel o' di'mon's</i>,
I&mdash;Oh, in cose I knowed he
didn't <i>do</i> it, honey! I knowed he didn't
<i>do</i> it! An' dis is de fus' time I has even
tole dat <i>I</i> knowed Mars Van was at Roseneath
dat night!"</p>

<p>"Ez fer Rufe Drennon," remarked Betty,
"what kin you 'spec' fum po'-white folks,
anyhow."</p>

<p>Olive returned to the house, walking on
air; her heart sang like a freed bird. As
she passed around the vine-hung nook of
the gallery where the dumb and motionless

<!-- page 281 -->

invalid had so often lain in his chair, she
stopped.</p>

<p>"<i>Ah, Sir Lancelot, there thou liest</i>,"&mdash;the
words rose involuntarily to her lips,&mdash;"<i>thou
that wert never matched of earthly
knight's hand; and thou wert the courtliest
knight that ever bare shield; and thou wert
the truest friend to thy lover that ever bestrode
horse</i>"&mdash;</p>

<p>She sought her memory in vain for the
next sentence; and she turned into the library.
The little squat copy of "Morte
d'Arthur," how well she remembered it! It
used to be always in Young Van's hands.
She went to a small bookcase in a corner
and began searching among the books that
had belonged to her brother. Yes, there
it was, with its battered binding and torn
leaves!</p>

<p>"<i>And thou wert the kindest man that ever
strake with sword; and thou wert the goodliest
person that ever came among press of
knights</i>."</p>

<p>She closed the book and laid it back on
the shelf. "Yes, you were all that and
more, my father, my hero!"</p>

<p>She was turning away when something
wedged in between a couple of volumes on

<!-- page 282 -->

the same shelf caught her eye. A confused
sense of recognition stirred her at sight of
it, and she took it down. It was a somewhat
bulky diary, bound in red morocco.
Some letters were fastened to it with a bit
of tape. She turned it over in her hands;
the confused memory became clear in a
flash. It was the packet which she had
seen her father thrust into his pocket as he
came out to her on the gallery that last fatal
afternoon&mdash;the day his voice had ceased
forever in the midst of his life-story! She
now remembered seeing it lying on the floor
after Liberty had carried him into his room.
Some one had doubtless picked it up, amid
the excitement, and placed it in the cabinet,
where all these years it had remained unnoticed
and forgotten. This surmise was correct,
Job afterward admitting that it was
himself who had "lef' it dar, ontell Mars
Van mout ax fer it," and then forgotten it.</p>

<p>The packet was marked in her father's
bold handwriting: "<i>Private and Personal</i>."
Olive untied the tape with shaking
fingers and examined its contents.</p>

<p>There were several letters; some of these
were quite yellow with age. One was from
Herring's mother, written evidently when

<!-- page 283 -->

he was a little boy and away from home for
the first time. The grand-daughter smiled
a little at the old-fashioned phraseology;
but the tears sprang to her eyes as she read
the <i>post scriptum:</i>&mdash;</p>

<br/>

<p>And above All things, my Son, you must
be Honest and Faithful, and Never break
your Word, though you should be Reviled
for keeping it. <span class="smcap">Mother</span>.</p>

<br/>

<p>Two letters she laid aside as too sacred
for even a daughter's eyes to dwell upon;
they were marked: "<i>From my beloved
wife</i>." Besides these there were one from
herself,&mdash;a funny little scrawl; she remembered
quite well the day she wrote it,
and sent it in one of her mother's to the faraway
camp in Virginia!&mdash;and one in Young
Van's sprawly schoolboy hand. Another
was indorsed on the envelope, "<i>John Thornham.
Received Oct</i>. 14, 1857."</p>

<p>Olive unfolded the large business-looking
sheet. The letter, dated from New Orleans,
began abruptly:&mdash;</p>

<br/>

<p><span class="smcap">Vanborough Herring</span>: I do not know
what wrongs my sister Elinor suffered at

<!-- page 284 -->

your hands, or what stain you may have
placed upon the old and honorable name
you bear. I do not wish to know. My
sister evidently cherished for you until the
day of her death a feeling which her wrongs&mdash;if
she had any&mdash;had been unable to destroy.
I find among the papers which I
brought away with me from Roseneath a
letter addressed to myself, written shortly
before her death, and intended to be read,
as it has been, after she had passed away.
It was her wish that certain property belonging
exclusively to herself should be
converted into money and given to you unconditionally.
Or rather, with the sole condition
that the gift should remain a secret
between you and myself. You may have
some idea concerning her reasons for this
condition; I have not. At any rate, I make
no doubt&mdash;whatever your character may
be&mdash;you will respect her wishes in this
matter. But I will be greatly obliged if
you will affix your name to the inclosed line
attesting under oath your intention of submitting
to the above-mentioned condition.
Upon receipt of this, the money, amounting
to fifty thousand dollars, will be placed in
the bank of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; in Galveston subject to
your demand.</p>

<!-- page 285 -->

<p>I desire also, with your permission, to
add to this the sum of one thousand dollars
for the purchase of the negro, Liberty, who
belonged to my sister Elinor, to belong in
future to your daughter, Olive Vanborough
Herring; named, as I understand, for my
mother. With this proviso: that she be
kept in ignorance of her ownership of this
piece of property until she is twenty-one
years of age. If anything in this latter
transaction strikes you as strange, set it
down to the well-known eccentricity of the
Thornhams.</p>

<p>Let me hear from you as soon as possible.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">John Thornham</span>.</p>

<br/>

<p>Some further correspondence had evidently
passed between the two men relative
to these bequests: for there was another
letter, undated, but written probably some
weeks later. It was very brief:&mdash;</p>

<br/>

<p>I am glad to know the truth, so far as
you are concerned. I could not bring myself
to believe that a Vanborough could be
guilty of a thing so dishonorable. Take the
money, then, with a free heart, as she wished,
poor girl! But bear in mind the condition

<!-- page 286 -->

which she herself imposed. Your little Olive
resembles my mother strangely. J. T.</p>

<br/>

<p>On the margin of this note was the memorandum:&mdash;"<i>J.
T. died of yellow fever in
New Orleans in</i> 1859."</p>

<p>To these letters, clearing the mystery of
Herring's sudden acquisition of money for
the purchase of Roseneath and other property,
his daughter did not attach the significance
which they assumed in the eyes of
Newall when he examined them later. The
main fact&mdash;Drennon's confession, which
removed the stain of infamy from her father's
name&mdash;made all else seem of small
importance. A dim recollection of a tall
dark man bending over her and softly repeating
her name, <i>Olive Vanborough</i>, flitted
intangibly through her mind as she read
the lines which concerned the gift to herself of "the negro, Liberty." But she was
too absorbed to grasp it.</p>

<p>She laid aside the letters and took up,
reverently, the leather-covered diary. Its
closely written pages contained the story&mdash;much
more in detail, and brought to something 
like a conclusion&mdash;that her father
had partly related to her. It was begun in

<!-- page 287 -->

Washington, evidently soon after Duncan's
visit; but appearances indicated that the
last lines were written the day of their arrival
at Roseneath.</p>

<p>It was a passionate outpouring of the
man's inmost soul; penned perhaps as a relief
to the repressed and tortured life; certainly
meant to be overlooked by no human
eye save his own. Olive quivered as she
read; fascinated, stirred, shaken to the very
depths of her being by the spectacle of a
great tender heart, bare and bleeding under
her gaze.</p>

<p>"She told me," the narrative went on,
after describing at some length that part of
the writer's interview with Elinor Thornham
which related to the broken engagement
and her reasons therefor, "she told
me that she wished me to have the property
which had come to her, personally, from her
grandmother, who was also mine, and which
was absolutely at her own disposition. She
did not mention the amount; and at that
time I supposed it to be trifling. For reasons
which at this distance of time I shrink
from putting upon paper, I at first and with
some warmth declined this legacy. But her
agitation at my refusal was so extreme that,

<!-- page 288 -->

alarmed by her suffering, I promised to do
whatever she wished in all matters. 'One
of these days, then,' she said, 'I hope you
will live at Roseneath.' This remark I
hardly noticed at the moment; she was
very weak and ill, and my thoughts were
more upon herself than upon what she was
saying. Finally, she opened the little casket,
which she had held during the whole of
our interview in her hand, and showed me a
necklet&mdash;a child's gewgaw&mdash;which she had
worn when she was my Olive's age, desiring
me to send my little daughter to her the
next day, that she might clasp it around her
neck with her own hands. Then, at last,
I kissed her an eternal good-by, and came
away. She seemed so nervously anxious lest
my presence there should become known
to the inmates of the house that I passed
out at one of the windows, and crossed the
rose-garden to the gate. I saw no one,
though I seem sometimes, when I recall it
all, to have heard the sound of wheels in
the road outside."</p>

<p>An account followed of the circumstances
of Elinor Thornham's death and burial; and
of John Thornham's first letter, and of the
narrator's surprise at its contents.</p>

<!-- page 289 -->

<p>"I did not understand the full meaning of
Thornham's reference to Elinor's wrongs,"
he continued; "at that time I supposed him
to allude only to the broken engagement and
to my subsequent marriage. I felt justified
in writing him a full account of my last interview
with his sister, wherein she explained
her motives in severing those early bonds,
and of my own conduct in consequence of
her (supposed) unjust and wayward treatment.</p>

<p>"I thought I understood Elinor's wish to
confine the knowledge of her bequest to her
brother and myself. She had, in fact, in
her last talk with me, hinted that my wife
might very naturally be disturbed by such
a legacy from the woman whom I had once
loved. I stated this frankly. I could not,
I said, for the sake of the money, give pain
to the mother of my children. Some money
due me in Kentucky from a family lawsuit,
and about to be paid, would, as he suggested
later,&mdash;and did,&mdash;render any explanation
to my wife unnecessary. I did not, unhappily, 
take the outside world into account.
In referring to John Thornham's own gift
to my little girl, I mentioned Elinor's legacy
to her of the neck-chain, a circumstance so

<!-- page 290 -->

trivial in itself that but for his peculiar
interest in the child I should hardly have
remembered it at all. I now know that this
disposed, for him, of the hideous charge
which, unknown to myself alone, had been
brought against me by the people among
whom I lived; while in his reference to it I
read simply enough an allusion to the broken
engagement. So, after a somewhat prolonged
correspondence, I signed the written
condition."</p>

<p>The writer gave a minute account of his
journey to Galveston, where he received the
money which he brought back to Thornham,
and which he at once invested in the purchase 
of Roseneath, and in laying the foundation 
for later speculations. He described
the growing and inexplicable coldness of
many of his neighbors and friends. This at
first, absorbed in arranging and planning
for his new life, he scarcely noted; then,&mdash;his
overwhelming astonishment and indignation
when by a curious chance he learned
the cause.</p>

<p>"I doubt whether in that moment," he
wrote, "stung to the heart's core by this calumny,
I should have justified myself even if
I could honorably have done so. In regard

<!-- page 291 -->

to the theft of the necklet, indeed, which
seemed as ridiculous as it was unjust, I could
have made no explanation whatever. I did
not know, and I have never been able to
conjecture, what became of it, unless some
servant entered the room and took it after
I left her and before the others came in to
find her dead on the couch. Curiously
enough, no one&mdash;except possibly a few
friends foolish enough to believe in me&mdash;ever
seems to have given me the benefit of
this doubt. I found myself suddenly surrounded
by a horrible atmosphere of suspicion
and distrust. No word was ever spoken
openly in my hearing, no chance given me to
cram the lie down the throat of my slanderers.
I said to myself, foolishly enough, that
Truth is mighty and will prevail; and I
waited."</p>

<p>Olive's horror and indignation deepened
as she read on. It was all there; the mute
questioning in the eyes of the wife; the
daily torture of the sensitive, shrinking boy;
the slowly hardening pride of the strong
man, conscious of his own integrity; the
quickly destroyed illusion of hope which
was born of the soldier's gallant record; the
defiant despair which followed the death

<!-- page 292 -->

of his first-born; of his wife and little children.</p>

<p>"But Olive, at least,&mdash;my bright sunny-hearted
Olive,&mdash;had never been made to
share or bear this awful burden. By a miracle
for which I thanked God daily, on my
knees, she had escaped all knowledge of
the cloud which hung over us. But at
last"&mdash;</p>

<p>The last pages, burning with a record of
his anguish upon learning that his cherished
and adored daughter had at length been told
the infamous story, were written more hurriedly
than the rest. These were doubtless
the pages that he had penned that last day,
and just before&mdash;impelled by some forever
unknowable feeling&mdash;he had partly broken
the seal of silence. The almost illegible
characters and the confused ending of the
sentences, showed that, even as he wrote,
the unseen enemy was creeping upon him.</p>

<p>As the daughter, with tear-reddened eyes,
finished reading the last pathetic words:
"<i>For myself, I no longer care, but for
Olive</i>,"&mdash;a step sounded on the gallery.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Newall!" she cried, springing
up and running eagerly to meet the lawyer,
"have you heard? Do you know?"</p>

<!-- page 293 -->

<p>"Yes, I know!" he responded, almost
choked with emotion; "I have just seen Alsbury.
Poor Van! And that scoundrel,
that villain, Rufe Drennon"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh," she interrupted, "he is lying yonder
in his cabin, dead. Rose's father, little
Olive's grandfather! Let us not think of
him, poor ignorant Rufe! Think rather of
how my father must be rejoicing where he is,
at sight of my happiness!"</p>

<p>She placed the diary and John Thornham's
letters in his hands.</p>

<p>"Think of my chancing upon them this
day of all others!" she said, showing him
their hiding-place.</p>

<p>His eyes lighted as he glanced through
them.</p>

<p>"I at least am bound by no vow of secrecy,
Olive, my child," he said when he had
finished. He rose and took his hat. "And
before I sleep to-night all questions concerning
your father's life, so far as a prying public
has any right to ask, shall be fully and
forever answered."</p>

<p>He lingered only long enough to explain
the significance of the documents he held.</p>

<p>"Here come Doctor and Mrs. Alsbury,
Major Burnham and his wife, and Jack

<!-- page 294 -->

Addington," he called back from the door.
"Let them rejoice with you, Olive. They
have the right, as true and faithful friends
of your father."</p>

<p>"Come back a minute, Mr. Newall!"
She met him as he turned, and placed her
hands on his shoulders. "I know who has
been the truest and faithfulest of all," she
said, looking affectionately at him, "and if
a daughter's love and devotion can repay"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Repay! nonsense!" he interrupted with
a gruffness belied by his beaming face;
"who dares to talk of payment of any sort
between father and daughter!"</p>

<p>XVI.</p>

<p class="small">MARK KENNISON.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> storm which had raged in Kennison's
soul seemed to have spent itself when
he left Olive Herring shedding tears of sacred
joy over the vindication of her father's
good name, and came out once more into
the open air. He walked slowly down the
wide avenue, and, passing out at the park-gate,
entered the road which led townward,
wholly forgetful of Alsbury's old horse which
stretched a long neck toward him from the
rose-garden wicket, whinnying and tugging
at the hitch-rein.</p>

<p>He felt bruised and sore, as if he had
come out of a sharp physical contest. He
wondered dully at his late outburst, well
knowing that nothing could ever move him
again. He tried vainly to recall the scene
in Drennon's cabin. A blurred picture only,
in which he himself had no part, presented
itself to his mind,&mdash;a shaggy head turning
restlessly on a pillow; a belt of sunshine

<!-- page 296 -->

lying across an uneven floor; a line of small
ants crawling up the leg of a rickety table,&mdash;and
the fragmentary vision faded away.
Finally he ceased to think altogether, moving
automatically along the dusty highway
without volition of his own. But something
startled him suddenly again into life. It
was the voice of June Badgett calling to
him from the Man-Fig, where he stood with
his back against the gnarled tree-trunk.</p>

<p>"Hello, parson," he drawled, "wher have
you been? You look like you've seen a
ghos'."</p>

<p>Kennison ran forward and stopped, facing
him savagely. The demoniac fury which
had possessed him came surging back with
increased violence. His breast heaved; his
white lips quivered in an impotent attempt
at speech. He was seized with an insane
desire to smite the old man in the face; his
clenched fist trembled at his side as he
hissed, at length, rather than said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you want to know where I have
been, June Badgett? Well, I will tell you.
I come from the death-bed of the man who
stole Elinor Thornham's diamonds."</p>

<p>There was a movement of curiosity among
the idlers lounging around. Badgett started

<!-- page 297 -->

forward with an inarticulate cry; his eyeballs
seeming ready to burst from his head.</p>

<p>"Diamonds!" Kennison stopped and
laughed scornfully,&mdash;"a miserable little
trinket, too insignificant to buy even <i>your</i>
soul, June Badgett, contemptible as that
is!"</p>

<p>"Who was the thief?" ventured one of
the crowd, unable longer to contain his curiosity.</p>

<p>"The thief?" echoed the minister. "The
thief," he said with deliberate slowness,
"was one of your own friends, and my
father-in-law, Rufus Drennon."</p>

<p>And without noticing the amazed ejaculations
which arose about him, he told the
story again, as he had a little while before
told it to Olive Herring, using Drennon's
own words, and unconsciously copying the
dying man's very gestures and intonations.</p>

<p>"And there," he concluded harshly, addressing
Badgett, "there is where I have
been, and that is the ghost I have seen."</p>

<p>With that he turned abruptly and continued
his walk toward the village.</p>

<p>The effect of this revelation upon Badgett
was terrible.</p>

<p>"<i>I done it. God-a-mighty, I done it!</i>"

<!-- page 298 -->

he shrieked, throwing up his arms and
clutching wildly at his gray hair.</p>

<p>Nobody ever stopped to think of it, but
June had nearly reached the allotted three
score and ten of years; his once burly figure
was bent and shuffling; his flabby face was
seamed with wrinkles, his eyes bleared and
sunken.</p>

<p>"Jedge not that ye be not jedged," he continued
hoarsely. "I thought Van took 'em.
I wish my Maker may strike me stone dead
ef I wa'n't shore that Van took 'em! I
done all the mischief. I done it! I kep'
the parson fum marryin' the sweetes' young
gal in Thornham! I done it all! God-a-mighty
let jedgment fall on me! Let the
Hand o' God strike ole June Badgett, an'
strike hard. God-a-mighty have mercy on
my soul. I done it!"</p>

<p>His companions fell back, staring at him
in helpless wonder, and finally slunk away,
one by one, leaving him alone under the
Man-Fig.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>As Kennison approached the village he
saw Doctor Alsbury standing in the midst
of an excited group, gesticulating and talking
loudly and rapidly. For the first time

<!-- page 299 -->

he remembered the horse and buggy, and
half turned, wondering idly how Alsbury
had got to town. But the torpor was on
him again, and he plodded on, heavily, toward
his own house. The group about the
doctor was breaking up; people were hurrying
away to tell the news; heads were thrust
out of office windows; horsemen were leaning
from their saddles; the air was thrilled
with breathless questions and excited replies;
women came running, bareheaded, to
their gates, calling to each other and to
chance passers; they shrank aside, frightened,
as Kennison stumbled by with staring
but unseeing eyes.</p>

<p>He reached his study at last, and threw
himself into a chair, where he sat motionless
and without thought or feeling, for hours.
A summons to supper failed to rouse him,
though he had eaten nothing since morning.
Big Hannah lighted the lamp, looking at
him curiously, for she had already been up
to Roseneath to talk over the wonderful
news and to ask Miss Olive whether she
should put "mo'nin' " on little Olive for
her grandfather; she withdrew silently, forbearing
to intrude even his child upon her
stricken master.</p>

<!-- page 300 -->

<p>As the hours passed, the lonely man became
aware that something was beginning
to pierce through his apathy&mdash;something
strangely, poignantly sweet. He felt upon
his breast the nestling touch of the head
that had rested there for one brief moment
that day. A thrill passed through him and
he arose, instantly alert and alive. The
shame and the disgrace were forgotten.</p>

<p>"Oh," he cried in a sort of ecstasy, "she
will surely understand when I tell her how
it has all been a dream&mdash;a strange, sad, terrible
dream, which began in this very room
the night when, coward and fool that I was!
I cast her out of my life, and with her all
that was best and highest within me! Surely
she will understand! Has she not kept herself 
free all these years? Can it have been
for my sake? Olive, Olive, all that has been
dead so long&mdash;poetry, romance, feeling, the
desire to achieve, the longing to do&mdash;all
that mates with your own high and ardent
soul&mdash;is reborn within me at this hour!
Together&mdash;together we will"&mdash;</p>

<p>He paused, exhausted with excess of emotion.
A lingering smile illuminated his pale
features. He arose and passed into the next
room, where his child lay sleeping in her

<!-- page 301 -->

crib, Big Hannah nodding on the floor beside
her. He stooped and kissed the red
slightly parted lips, and as he did so his
heart smote him, remembering her mother.</p>

<p>"Dear little Rose," he murmured, "you at
least were innocent and loving. But I do
no wrong to your memory, Rose, for you
loved <i>her</i> always; yes," he whispered, "I
will go to her to-morrow morning. She will
understand. Olive, <i>Olive Kennison</i>," he
smiled, bending again over the sleeping
child.</p>

<p>He forced himself to remember, as he
turned away, that he would be compelled
the next morning to make arrangements for
Rufe Drennon's funeral.</p>

<p>"But I will not let the day pass without
seeing her&mdash;Olive, my Olive," he said impatiently,
throwing himself, without undressing,
upon his bed.</p>

<hr/>

<div class="center" id="ch17">

<p>XVII.</p>

<p class="small">A SUMMER AFTERNOON.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Olive Herring</span> arose early the morning
following the confession and death of Drennon.
She had lain awake&mdash;for very joy!&mdash;the
short summer night through. But she
felt no fatigue; she ran like a child about
the old home, now become dearer than ever;
and along the brier-grown walks of the
garden.</p>

<p>"Oh, if he could only have lived to this
day!" she cried at last, seating herself on
the step of Betty's cabin, and looking up in
her nurse's sympathetic old face. "If they
could have all shared this happiness&mdash;father
and mother and Van! Think what
it would have meant to them, Maum Betty,
after all they suffered."</p>

<p>"Dass so," said Betty, "but don' you
fret yo'se'f, Miss Olive, chile. Dey kin see
an' onderstan'. An' dey sholy is shoutin'
in Kingdom-Come dis minit!"</p>

<p>Soon after breakfast, people began to

<!-- page 303 -->

drop in upon one pretext or another. Some
of these visitors were old friends; many
were mere acquaintances; but all came, interested
and congratulatory. It appeared
that no one in Thornham had believed the
slander, after all!</p>

<p>Newall's lip curled a little cynically, as
he watched the procession stream in and
out, and listened to the buzz of reminiscent
indignation. But there was no room for
bitterness in Olive's soul. She met her
guests with frankly extended hands, her
heart throbbing with exultation.</p>

<p>"How good they all are!" she said to herself
again and again. "Oh, if he were but
here beside me, my father!"</p>

<p>Toward noon, when everybody had gone,
even Newall, who was as restless as a lover
away from this daughter of his heart, she
went up into her old bedroom, unused
these many years. The flat air was musty
within and the purple shadows lay heavy
along the floor. She moved softly forward,
and her blood tingled; for she seemed as
she entered to catch an elusive glimpse of
her mother's white-robed figure, stealing
away from the bedside, where she had so
often knelt to pray above her sleeping child!</p>

<!-- page 304 -->

<p>She opened the door of the huge cedar
<i>armoire</i> which stood in an alcove.</p>

<p>"How foolish I am!" she exclaimed,
rummaging-among its contents; "and yet,
why should I not, on this wonderful day?"</p>

<p>She chose from among the heap of half-forgotten
garments laid away on the sweet-smelling
shelves the diaphanous rose-pink
gown which she had worn that long-gone
summer afternoon when Kennison had
breathed into her ears the old-new story
whose end was heartache and bitterness.
She slipped it on, fastening the dainty ribbons 
and smoothing the yellowed laces into
place. Then she walked to the long mirror,
lifting the skirts from the dust.</p>

<p>"How foolish I am!" she repeated.
"Why, I am past twenty-five. I am a
dreary old maid!"</p>

<p>The face looking back at her from the
glass belied her words. It was a marvelously
beautiful face. The troubles and
anxieties of these later years had but added
a subtler charm to the lovely features, a
more luminous depth to the dark eyes. She
smiled at the slightly old-fashioned look of
the gown which sheathed her slender figure,
exquisite in the virginal purity of its outlines;

<!-- page 305 -->

the smile made the mirrored face so
radiantly young that she started back, wondering
if that could indeed be herself!
Hastily loosening her abundant and beautiful
hair, she wound it in the old way about
her head, letting the curling tendrils caress
her white neck and lie on the low white
brow,&mdash;from which every trace of mistrust
had vanished. Then she stood with a finger
on her lip, smiling bashfully, as if half-ashamed
of her own loveliness.</p>

<p>"Miss Olive," said Big Hannah, appearing
in the doorway holding little Olive by
the hand. The child dashed forward, screaming
with delight; a black sash was tied
about her waist, and the sleeves of her white
gown were fastened with black ribbons.
Olive blushed guiltily; she had forgotten
Rufe Drennon's funeral!</p>

<p>"Lawd, Miss Olive, how pretty you does
look!" cried Big Hannah, her eyes wandering
in open and undisguised admiration
over the daintily arrayed figure before her.
Then, recollecting her errand, "There's a
gent'lum downstairs waitin' to see you,
Miss Olive."</p>

<p>There was a significance in Big Hannah's
voice which brought the blood to the cheek
of her mistress.</p>

<!-- page 306 -->

<p>"A gentleman? Very well, Big Hannah.
You may say that I will be down in
a few moments."</p>

<p>She hurriedly unfastened the ribbons of
her gown, but retied them after a second's
consideration.</p>

<p>"No," she murmured, "I will not take it
off. On this day, at least, I will wear no
mourning."</p>

<p>She descended the long flight of steps
slowly. Her heart was beating fast. She
was beginning to shrink painfully from the
interview which she had instinctively foreseen.</p>

<p>On the landing she turned, irresolute;
then with sudden determination she ran
swiftly down and entered the little sitting-room.
There was no one there. Puzzled,
she crossed the wide hall to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>The curtainless windows were open, and
a drowsy breeze, drifting in, stirred the
faint perfume that arose from the tall spice-jars
in the chimney-corners. She stood for
a moment on the threshold, the bare polished
floor reflecting the rosy cloud of her
draperies. Then with a single rapturous
cry she flew into his arms. There was no

<!-- page 307 -->

greeting, no question, no answer. Her face
was on his breast; her tear-wet eyes were
shining into his; his caressing inarticulate
words were in her ears; his kisses were on
her lips, her cheeks, her hair!</p>

<p>"When&mdash;when did you come?" she
asked, when at last she found voice to
speak.</p>

<p>"Just now," returned Duncan. For it
was Duncan Jeffrey&mdash;a little stouter, and
very bronzed by his tropical wanderings,
but young, erect, and handsomer than ever.
"Just now; I drove out direct from the station.
Old Dud Welsh came over on the
train with me from H&mdash;&mdash;. He told me&mdash;O
Olive, how could you <i>dare</i> not to tell
me?" he broke off reproachfully.</p>

<p>"He told you"&mdash;she urged breathlessly.</p>

<p>"He told me of your father's&mdash;affliction
and death. And of the loss of the money;
and of your school. O Olive, how brave,
how noble you have been; and what a blundering,
ignorant, selfish fool I have been!
How can you ever forgive me! How can
I ever forgive myself for loitering aimlessly
about the world, as I have been doing all
these years, leaving you to"&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 308 -->

<p>"Duncan," she interrupted earnestly,
"have you seen no one? Have you heard
nothing else?"</p>

<p>"Why no," he replied. "Jack Addington
ran out and hailed me as I passed the
warehouse, but I did not stop. Why?
What? Olive"&mdash;a sudden alarm shook
his voice,&mdash;"what more is there to tell?
You are not&mdash;Good God, Olive! You are
not married?"</p>

<p>She extricated herself from his arms, half-vexed,
half-laughing.</p>

<p>"No, I am not married. But, Duncan,"
her voice quivered a little, "tell me. Did
you know the story of my cousin Elinor
Thornham's diamonds when you asked me,
six years ago, to marry you?"</p>

<p>Jeffrey blushed scarlet through his sunburn
and tan. But he answered promptly,
"Yes, I have always known it."</p>

<p>He waited, afraid to add another word.</p>

<p>"And did you think that my father carried
away&mdash;that my father stole those diamonds?"</p>

<p>"<i>Olive!</i>" he cried, recoiling.</p>

<p>"Did you?" she persisted, gazing steadily
at him.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said, flushing again,

<!-- page 309 -->

and painfully embarrassed. "I only know
that I always thought him the bravest, noblest,
and truest gentleman that ever lived.
But if he had been a thousand times over
what they said he was, how could that have
made any difference in my love for you? I
would still have wanted you for my wife if
every drop of blood in your body had been
akin to a race of thieves and murderers."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad!" she cried, clinging
to him hysterically. "I almost <i>hoped</i> that
you believed it!"</p>

<p>He looked at her wonderingly, not daring
in his unhoped-for happiness to ask a question.</p>

<p>"I will tell you everything presently,"
she said, answering the look, "but first,
about yourself?"</p>

<p>"Oh, myself!" he echoed scornfully,
drawing her to a sofa and seating himself
beside her. "I am out of all patience
with myself. And yet, Olive, your letters
were so placid and cheerful. I had no hint
from any one else. The letters from my
agent&mdash;a newcomer in Thornham, you
know&mdash;contained simply business details,
and were very rare at that. I have been
tramping about strange countries, wearying

<!-- page 310 -->

myself with strange peoples, and trying to
keep myself from remembering too much
and longing too much. That is about all.
One night, nearly four months ago, lying in
a lonely camp in Ceylon, under the shadow
of a ruined temple, with no one near me but
my native guides,&mdash;for Ballard came home
long ago,&mdash;I seemed all at once to hear you
calling me. I did not wait for daylight.
Within the hour my face was set Westward.
I have been telling myself daily ever since
that I was an idiot to come with <i>that hope</i>.
And I had almost persuaded myself that I
was hurrying back because I was homesick
for the smell of the sugar-boiling at Good
Luck. Now"&mdash;</p>

<p>He stopped to lift her hand to his lips.</p>

<p>"But Olive, dear," he continued, "why
did you let me go away? Why have you
kept me away from you all these years, if
you"&mdash;</p>

<p>"If I loved you?" she finished the sentence
for him frankly. "I did love you,
Duncan," she went on, looking bravely in
his face, though her cheeks paled and her
voice shook. "I have loved you always;
yes, even when for a little while I was under
the spell of Mark Kennison's poetic and

<!-- page 311 -->

highly strung nature. Even at the moment
of plighting my troth to him the thought of
you stirred me so strangely that I forced
myself to put it aside."</p>

<p>This confession from the lips of the woman
loved so long and so hopelessly was
almost more than the eager listener could
bear. He leaned forward, gazing at her with
adoring eyes, no longer caring to know why
she had held him away from her. In this
supreme moment, the weary years behind
him were forgotten; the despair, the heartache,
the self-torture&mdash;all had fallen away
like an outworn garment!</p>

<p>"Yes, I have always loved you," she repeated
dreamily. "But I dared not let you
marry me after&mdash;I wish to tell you everything, 
Duncan. Listen."</p>

<p>He listened, breathless, while she related
all that had passed between Kennison and
herself that summer, six years ago; the wooing
in the old summer-house; the intervening
day, with its bright and joyous memories
of her father; the final and terrible
rupture. She spared the minister as much
as possible, softening his language to herself,
and hurrying over his statement of the public
belief in her father's guilt.</p>

<!-- page 312 -->

<p>But in the midst of the recital Jeffrey
started up, the veins on his forehead swollen
with anger.</p>

<p>"The scoundrel!" he shouted, "the
cowardly contemptible scoundrel. I will"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do not blame him too much, Duncan,"
she said gently. "Remember, he was a
stranger here then. Since that time, he has
had more to suffer than you yet know.
Besides"&mdash;an arch smile curved her lips.</p>

<p>"Besides, God bless him!" Jeffrey exclaimed,
seizing her hands again and covering
them with kisses; "besides, if he had
not been such a contemptible coward, perhaps
I should not be the happiest man in
the universe to-day!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she assented, still smiling.
"Then you came back," she said, taking up
the thread of her story again, after recounting 
the meeting with her father and the
then inexplicable change in his open attitude
toward her. "Even in the midst of
the shame and agony which overwhelmed me
when he&mdash;Kennison&mdash;left me that day,
Duncan, the thought of you, and how differently
you would have acted, came to me
to help me and comfort me. But how could
I let you take into your life one upon whom

<!-- page 313 -->

rested such dishonor and disgrace that another
man, plighted to her by sacred vows,
had deemed it his duty to abandon her?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say, Olive," demanded
Jeffrey almost sternly, "that this was the
reason you refused to be my wife?"</p>

<p>"This was the reason, then and after," she
replied simply. "Was it not enough? I
told myself that perhaps you, like myself,
had never heard the story; that you did not
know of the horrible suspicion that clung to
us&mdash;of the dark blot upon our name.
More than that, oh Duncan!" she burst into
a fit of passionate weeping, "there were
times when I think I must have believed it
myself!"</p>

<p>"No, you did not," he said, soothing her,
"you never did. Poor little girl!"</p>

<p>His tone and the touch of his hand on
her bowed head reminded her of her father;
her tears flowed afresh but more
quietly.</p>

<p>"It was the same when you came to us in
Washington," she went on when she had
grown calm once more. "The thought of
your going filled me with sadness, and a sort
of terror which seemed to forebode some
coming evil,&mdash;as indeed it did! But I

<!-- page 314 -->

could not, I dared not, link to yours a stained
and dishonored name. I think that my father
understood this feeling, though, knowing
of my broken engagement, and divining
its cause, he may have thought that my
heart clung to that lost illusion. But he
loved you as his own son, Duncan. If he
can look upon us now, I know that he is
happy at seeing us united at last."</p>

<p>"For all time, please God," interrupted
Jeffrey solemnly.</p>

<p>"For all time! Dear father! Those
were happy months in spite of all&mdash;that
winter at Washington!&mdash;I saw him so admired,
so honored, everywhere&mdash;for the
first time really himself: open, genial, gay.
And I saw into the secretest recesses of his
soul&mdash;except the one place where he kept
in honor, and for the sake of a pledge given
to a woman's memory, the secret which had
ruined his life."</p>

<p>She dwelt long and tenderly on the homecoming
and on the half-finished revelation
made the same day by Herring. The stroke
of paralysis; the sudden shattering of the
fortune so rapidly amassed; the long patient
weary years which followed&mdash;of all this
she spoke less freely; the wounds were too

<!-- page 315 -->

recent, the soreness too great, in spite of
the ecstasy of the past twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>"Kennison married Rose!" Jeffrey exclaimed
at that point of the narrative. "I
cannot conceive of it! Yet she was a
pretty, clinging, warm-hearted little creature.
And has she been happy with
him?"</p>

<p>"She died three years ago. Yes, she was
happy. Dear Rose! You must see her
little girl, Duncan, a little girl named for
me&mdash;Olive; Olive Kennison."</p>

<p>Duncan reddened angrily, then laughed
at the absurdity of his jealous thought.</p>

<p>Then came the history of Drennon's illness
and death. The all but incredible
story of the theft produced upon Jeffrey an
effect as electrical as it had upon Olive
herself. He walked about the room in a
transport of joyful excitement, hardly able
to contain himself.</p>

<p>"Did you not say," he asked curiously,
when the long and absorbing recital was
finally concluded, and they sat hand in hand,
silent from the very fullness of content,&mdash;"did
you not say that Kennison married
Rose Drennon?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<!-- page 316 -->

<p>"Then he became the son-in-law of the
actual"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't, Duncan," she implored, laying
her hand on his lips. "Let us forget that
forever. Let the dead rest in peace; and
as for the living&mdash;what I have myself suffered
makes me tender toward the pain and
mortification of Mark Kennison."</p>

<p>"Provided it is only that!" he returned,
smiling.</p>

<p>"And now, Duncan, you will understand
what I meant when I said that I almost
hoped you believed the story of my father's
crime when you asked me to be your wife.
Another man had cast me away from him
because of it. You, in spite of it"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hush!" he said peremptorily. "I will
not have it. I forbid you ever to refer to
that again. Do not my own sufferings for
the past six years count for something?"</p>

<p>"O Duncan!" she threw herself into his
arms again.</p>

<p>At that moment, Betty's voice rang
through the house.</p>

<p>"O Miss Olive! Fer Gawd's sake! Hally-hally-<i>lu-jah!</i>
Glory! De fountain o' blessin'
keeps a-runnin'! De Lawd's name be
praise'. Amen!"</p>

<!-- page 317 -->

<p>She appeared in the doorway, her turban
on one side, her suds-wet hands clasped above
her head, her eyes streaming.</p>

<p>"What is it, Maum?" cried Olive, flying
to her.</p>

<p>"Lib! Miss Olive, Lib! He's stompin'
'roun' on de dum-major's laig same ez of he
ain' never los' his'n. He's been practicin'
onbeknowns to me, an' he's done stropped
it on by his-se'f, dat dum-major's laig; an',
bless Gawd, he's a-struttin' 'roun' de back-yard
like a peacock! He's feered to come
up de steps, less'n he slip down&mdash;why,
Mars Dunc, is dat you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Aunt Betty, I have come home to
stay," he replied, coming forward and grasping
her hand.</p>

<p>"Hmp," she grunted, "it wuz high
time!"</p>

<p>"I think so myself, Aunt Betty," he said.
"I have been a fool to keep away all these
years."</p>

<p>"I agrees wi' you, Mars Dunc," she admitted
candidly.</p>

<p>Liberty's stentorian voice calling obstreperously,
"Betty! Betty! where is you, gal?"
recalled her to the business in hand, and she
hurried out.</p>

<!-- page 318 -->

<p>"Go and see him, Duncan, dear old
Lib!" Olive said. "I will join you presently."</p>

<p>She ran into the little morning-room.
Here, where so many dark hours had descended
upon her, she wished for a moment
to be alone with her sunshine.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • •</p>

<p>"She mus' be in the settin'-room then,"
said Big Hannah outside: and Madame de
Jolibois entered, accompanied by Miss Serena.
Both were clad in deep though eccentric
and Dibbs-like mourning.</p>

<p>"Be not affrighted at these habiliments
of woe, Olive," said Miss Kizzy, embracing
her quite cheerfully. "You have before
you the widow and the sister-in-law of the
late Monshur d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys. Death has
bereft us of our natural protector. Yes,
Olive, Monshur Anatole expired a year ago
in his native land. I received the information
of his demise the day before yesterday.
Hence these funereal trappings. And hence
the reason of Monshur Anatole's failure to
return to enter business and social circles in
Thornham. I feel as a wife; Serena feels
as a sister-in-law. We shall wear these
outward symbols of grief forever."</p>

<!-- page 319 -->

<p>"Oh, I am so sorry," exclaimed Olive,
conscious on a sudden of her pink frock and
ribbons.</p>

<p>"I sorrow at not having been with him in
his last moments," continued Miss Kizzy;
"so does Serena."</p>

<p>Miss "Fatty," smiling and comfortable
on the sofa, nodded assent.</p>

<p>"Pray forgive my appearance, Miss Kizzy,"
Olive hastened to say. "I put on this
colored gown because&mdash;of course you have
heard that my father's honor has been vindicated
by"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear child," interrupted Madame de
Jolibois, "I am delighted to see you in your
present attire. Such raiment is appropriate
to your youth and beauty. As to Vanborough
Herring, he needed no vindication in
my eyes. I never doubted him."</p>

<p>"I know you never did, dear, dear friend,"
cried Olive, throwing her arms about the
withered neck.</p>

<p>She started up. Kennison had entered
silently, and stood looking down at her.
His face showed traces of the painful struggle
of the previous day, and of the night's
sleepless vigil. His hands shook, he looked
ill and worn, but there was a light in his

<!-- page 320 -->

eyes which had long been a stranger to
them.</p>

<p>Olive read in his nervous and hesitating
manner his disappointment at not finding
her alone. She covered her own embarrassment
with a cordial welcome, and was talking 
on indifferent matters when Jeffrey
entered with Liberty, proud and happy on
the drum-major's leg. Betty, radiant, followed,
carrying the crutches in case of accident.</p>

<p>"Hello, Kennison!" cried the returned
wanderer with a heartiness whose genuineness
surprised himself. The sight of his
forlorn and defeated adversary stirred his
generous nature to the quick.</p>

<p>Kennison started and stammered; but,
instantly recovering himself, he took the
proffered hand in his own.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you back, Jeffrey," he
said, "when did you arrive?"</p>

<p>"I declare, Miss Kizzy!" Duncan said,
when he had answered a volley of questions
from everybody, including Newall, who had
hastened back to Roseneath as soon as business
would permit, "I do declare you look
younger than you did the day you stood me
in a corner for declining to <i>dosy-do</i>, as we

<!-- page 321 -->

used to call it, with Kitty Washington!
And how goes the Dancing-Academy?"</p>

<p>Madame de Jolibois tried hard to recover
the tone of decorous woe which she had
thought fit to assume.</p>

<p>"I do not, Duncan," she replied, "consider
it proper that the relict and the sister-in-law
of a d<i>ee</i> Jollyboys should continue to
degrade his memory by teaching the Saltatory
Art, and I have concluded an arrangement
whereby Sarah Ann Hunter shall
henceforth and forever conduct the exercises
in her own name, and receive all the emoluments.
We have rented our mansion to her.
It will in future be known as the Dibbs
Dancing-Academy. I am somewhat apprehensive
concerning the future of the very
young ladies and gentlemen of Thornham,
but Sarah Ann Hunter has our example before
her eyes, and I trust she will continue
to feel the solemn responsibility of her position.
Serena and I will retire to private
life. That is, we shall take in sewing for
our maintenance."</p>

<p>"You will do nothing of the kind, Miss
Kizzy," Jeffrey said warmly. "You and
Miss Fa&mdash;Miss Serena will come and live
at Good Luck&mdash;with us."</p>

<!-- page 322 -->

<p>He glanced at Olive as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Newall, delighted, "then
that is what fetched you home, you young
rascal!"</p>

<p>"The hope of it brought me," Duncan
said frankly.</p>

<p>Kennison's pale cheek grew a shade
paler.</p>

<p>Olive had opened her lips to declare
boldly in the face of them all that her betrothed
when he spoke knew nothing whatever
of Drennon's disclosure. But seeing
the pain and chagrin in the rector's eyes,
she forbore.</p>

<p>"Yes," Jeffrey was saying, "we shall
keep Good Luck, and spend a part at least
of each year there. For the rest, our plans
are hardly made as yet, except that we shall
be married within the month&mdash;from Roseneath."</p>

<p>"Why, Duncan!" remonstrated Olive,
forgetting in her surprise that they were not
alone, "you know that not a word has been
said about"&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;"From Roseneath," continued Jeffrey
calmly. "And we may run over to the
other side for a wedding-trip. Olive needs
a change of air."</p>

<!-- page 323 -->

<p>"Ef Mars Dunc had a-humped his-se'f
dat-a-way six year back," muttered Betty
in an aside to Liberty, "he neenter gone
foolin' 'roun' Affika, an' he neenter waited
nuther!"</p>

<p>"Dass so," said Liberty in the same tone,
"but den, 'oomans an' gals is dat onsartain
dat mebby ef he <i>hadn't</i> a-gone to Affika,
an' been so bowdacious long a-comin' back,
de chile mightn't o' had him!"</p>

<p>"Dass so," grinned his wife.</p>

<p>Jeffrey, pushing a chair aside, dislodged
something from the little table. It fell to
the floor; he stooped and picked up the
rusty leather box which contained Elinor
Thornham's "diamonds."</p>

<p>"What is this?" he asked carelessly.</p>

<p>Olive reached out a hand and took it
from him.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," she said quietly, putting
it out of sight,&mdash;"a forgotten plaything."</p>

<p>Kennison, turning to go, gave her a grateful
look.</p>
