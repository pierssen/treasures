<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Reader</span>:&mdash;The history of the past shows us that 
nations rise, go through a longer or shorter period of 
prosperity and then decay. The ruling motive in the 
life of nations, so far, has always been the same, the aggressive 
or masculine. Self-aggrandizement, <i>our</i> nation 
right or wrong, all to be laid upon the national altar in 
the name of patriotism, a centralizing of wealth and 
power in the hands of the few at the expense of the 
many, and the result has always been what? Go, 
gather together the human wrecks of any one nation 
and you have your answer.</p>

<p>Now will not this latest and brightest of nations perish 
also unless methods are changed, unless the social 
lever is reversed? Already the seeds of decay are 
taking root; is there not some law through which we 
may take a new lease of life, and what is that law, if 
there be such, if it be not that</p>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">woman, take the lead</span>?"</p>

<p>True, woman is already quite prominent, is becoming 
more so, but she does not seem as yet to realize 
that with man's methods she will succeed no better than 
man has done. She must formulate her own methods 
before her true work can appear. Woman must be 
free, must refuse to be led, must believe in herself,  

<!-- page 6 -->

before the evils attendant upon imperfect motherhood 
can be eliminated, and as I see things, the only hope 
of our nation lies in this direction.</p>

<p>Let us once rise above the necessity of armies, navies, 
prisons, almshouses, asylums, etc., then the future will 
stretch out before us with ever increasing brightness. 
The first step toward this desirable consummation is to 
believe that it <i>can</i> be done; the next is that it <i>will</i> be 
done, and lastly to determine to do it <i>ourselves</i>.</p>

<h2>A SEX REVOLUTION.</h2>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

</div>

<p>First, a little something about myself. I, Margaret 
Mulgrove, am a childless widow. My husband, Richard 
Mulgrove, went into the Union army at the beginning 
of our last war and never came out alive. My 
only child, little Bessie, took the scarlet fever in the 
second year of my widowhood, and though employing 
the most skillful physician in the whole country around, 
I could not save her. To say that I was desolate does 
not begin to express the feeling I had.</p>

<p>An aunt, my father's only sister who lived in 
another State, hearing of my bereavement, decided to 
come and stay with me awhile and wrote me to that 
effect. Now my father and mother had in their lifetime 
(I forgot to say that I was an orphan also) had been 
good orthodox Christians and had brought me up to 
walk in the same path, so when Aunt Belinda wrote me 
she was coming I was a little troubled, for I had been 
told that she was an Infidel.</p>

<p>I believed infidelity to be something awful, and 
as our community was a very respectable one, to 
have a woman of that character come among us, and as 
my relative was an affliction I had not counted on, but 
it could not be helped; aunt would be there the next 
day and I must make the best of it. So the next morning 
I went to work to put things in the best order 
possible to receive my expected relative.</p>

<!-- page 8 -->

<p>She came about ten o'clock, a pleasant faced, 
white haired lady toward whom my heart instinctively 
went out, and in spite of my prejudices I felt that I 
should love her. She stayed with me several months 
during which time nothing was said or done which 
brought up the subject of beliefs. True, I had purposely 
avoided everything that could lead in that 
direction, but she did not seem at all inclined to be 
aggressive.</p>

<p>The Sunday, and in fact the day before she left, 
our minister's sermon called out some remarks from 
her that surprised me very much.</p>

<p>"Why aunt," I exclaimed, "I thought you were 
an Infidel!"</p>

<p>"And so I am to church theology."</p>

<p>"And yet you have just affirmed your belief in 
the underlying principle of all church theology."</p>

<p>"How is that?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You said you believe in God manifest in the flesh."</p>

<p>"I said I believed God manifest in the flesh 
was necessary to the salvation of the race, but I did not 
say I believed it had already taken place."</p>

<p>"Not taken place! do you then look for a coming 
Christ?"</p>

<p>The old lady smiled. "Before you can understand 
me," she said, "you must learn that a narrow 
personal application of a general principle is, must be 
false. The universal spirit of life can never be manifest 
in its fullness through, or be embodied in a person, 
in any one man or woman. When God is manifest in 
the flesh as I mean, it will be through the race. 
Man, as a race will have become God-like, will have 
arisen above his present condition, will be saved, not 

<!-- page 9 -->

from future, but from present hells."</p>

<p>"Well, I really cannot understand you, aunt."</p>

<p>"I mean simply this, my child, when enough of the 
love, power and wisdom immanent in the deific fountain 
becomes developed in the race, and in harmonious 
proportions, then the evils which now afflict humanity 
will disappear."</p>

<p>"But how is this to be done?" I asked.</p>

<p>"By belief in our own power to accomplish, 
through the God within ourselves, that which the church 
expects, waits for a God outside of ourselves to do for us. 
God, the soul or spirit of the universe must be manifest 
in, and act through us to the overcoming of all 
difficulties, to the surmounting of every obstacle that 
lies in the way of the progress of the race."</p>

<p>"But we are such weak mortals," I said.</p>

<p>"We are weak only through ignorance, weak 
because we do not know how to handle nature's forces, 
which are the true God forces."</p>

<p>Here I involuntarily looked at my hands which 
were small and delicate, as if to ask: "What can 
these do toward saving a world?"</p>

<p>Aunt Hobart saw the movement and asked: "How 
far can you make your voice heard, Margaret?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have a good strong voice, aunt."</p>

<p>"But suppose you wanted to call the doctor here immediately, 
could you stand in the door and call him 
from his office?"</p>

<p>"You know I could not, besides, a voice like that, 
and all possessing it alike, would be a very unpleasant 
endowment. The noise, the confusion of sounds, with 
every one calling at such a distance for whatever they 
might want would make a perfect babel."</p>

<!-- page 10 -->

<p>"What then would you do?"</p>

<p>"I would step across the street to the telephone and 
call through that."</p>

<p>"So you would make your voice heard after all?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so." And then I repeated: 
"Nature's forces are the real God-forces," for I was 
beginning to get a glimpse of her meaning.</p>

<p>"Yes, the real God-forces, a knowledge of one of 
which will enable you to send your voice hundreds of 
miles in any direction you choose, provided nature's 
conditions have been previously complied with; 
through such knowledge you can extend your personality, 
your veritable self, in your voice, over a vast range of 
space, but you are an invisible silence at every point 
except where you desire to manifest a God-like power, 
but what does that power say?"</p>

<p>"What does it say?" I repeated wonderingly.</p>

<p>"It says, 'Child, obey me, and then command me.' "</p>

<p>"How, I do not understand?"</p>

<p>"Can you speak your message through a telephone 
unless all the conditions upon which the transmission 
of the sound depends have been complied with?" she 
asked in reply.</p>

<p>"Certainly not, aunt."</p>

<p>"And if everything is right, if the governing law 
has been obeyed, and you make the effort, can anything 
prevent your being heard at the desired point?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," I again said, and then added, 
"you make things very plain, but it is all so very different 
from the way I have been taught it bewilders me."</p>

<p>"But you can understand that when you obey the 
law you command the result&mdash;command a God-force; 
is it not so?"</p>

<!-- page 11 -->

<p>"It seems so," I answered hesitatingly, "but it 
looks almost like blasphemy to say so; we, poor mortals, 
to talk of commanding God-forces!"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, my dear child, it is true and when 
we, the race, have so come to understand, and so 
learned to obey a sufficient number of those God-forces 
to cover all human needs, then we shall be able to so 
command them as to save ourselves from every human 
ill. Then God will be manifest in the flesh in fact and 
in deed."</p>

<p>For some little time I sat in silence. I was overwhelmed 
with the magnitude of the thought. Seeing 
that I made no reply, aunt continued:</p>

<p>"You can now understand what Jesus meant when 
he said that heaven and earth might pass away but 
not one jot or tittle of the law. The law, not human 
enactments but nature's commands must be obeyed 
before the desired end can be obtained. The only 
price current for any and every blessing is perfect obedience 
to the law involved. No bribery in nature's courts."</p>

<p>"You quote a good deal of bible for an Infidel," I 
remarked.</p>

<p>"And why not Margaret? Because I am an Infidel 
in the church sense of that term, it does not necessarily 
follow that I am Infidel to truth. If you question the 
fact that nature's laws are immutable, suppose you 
test the matter in the realm of mathematics. Could 
you solve even one problem therein if the law involved 
is not strictly obeyed?"</p>

<p>"No, aunt, I could not," I hesitatingly replied. "I 
might work at it as long as I pleased, but I could never 
obtain a correct result if I violated the simplest rule 
concerned."</p>

<!-- page 12 -->

<p>"But suppose you do not violate the simplest rule, 
what then?"</p>

<p>"Why, the correct result is sure to be obtained; it 
has to come."</p>

<p>Aunt quietly smiled at my reply. "In other words, 
you command the result," she said, "and now, my dear, 
which interpretation honors Jesus the most, the one 
which the church has adopted, or the one I have given? 
I refer to his declaration of the necessity of fulfilling 
the law, of course, though there are many more of 
his sayings that are just as little understood."</p>

<p>"You are opening up to me a wonderful range of 
thought," I said in reply, "and I only wish that you 
had said these things sooner, or that you were going to 
stay longer."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think I have said enough now to keep you 
busy with thought for some time to come, and you can 
visit me after a while and then we can talk more of 
nature's laws and of such portions of the bible as 
shadow them forth."</p>

<p>She left me the next morning, but just before she 
went she put а book into my hand saying, "Read it 
carefully, it will give you food for thought." I took the 
book and laid it aside. I was too full of the train of 
thought that had been aroused to read then.</p>

<p>While aunt remained I had gladly devoted every moment 
to her, but now I was alone, and I could look at 
what had been said, could examine the sentiments advanced 
in the quiet of my own room. The first thing I 
did was to go over what had been said in connection 
with the telephone. I then took up the telegraph, and I 
thought if the telephone is an extension of the voice 
then the telegraph is an extension of the arm.</p>

<!-- page 13 -->

<p>I next tried to imagine how thousands of bona-fide 
fleshly arms would look extended through the atmosphere 
in all directions. The picture was too comical; 
I laughed till the tears came. The next thought was 
how likely they would be to get tangled, and then 
another hearty laugh. It was a wonderful school, 
this method of thinking, but the most important lesson 
learned was that the invisible is the real, that it is the 
real self that goes out upon telephonic and telegraphic 
lines, that the body is but the machine through which 
the "I am" acts.</p>

<p>Yes, I saw as I had never seen before that the 
invisible is the real, that spirit, mind, being invisible, 
could, through a knowledge of nature's invisible forces 
control the visible, the tangible. Then the idea of 
God manifest in the flesh as aunt Hobart presented 
it; but what about a crucified God, I asked when I 
thought of this. Now we are a sort of double beings and 
talk with ourselves, or there was some foreign invisible 
intelligence present, for if ever I asked questions and 
received replies I did then.</p>

<p>The response to the question: "What about a 
crucified God?" was "Through what feeling has the 
race suffered the most?"</p>

<p>"Through what feeling?" I repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes, through what feeling; has not that which 
gives the most happiness when conditions are right, 
been also the source of the deepest suffering to-wit love?"</p>

<p>My inner consciousness acknowledged the truth of 
this and the unknown something continued: "Then 
has not God, the God of love been crucified, nailed to 
the cross of hard conditions ever since the race had an 
existence?"</p>

<!-- page 14 -->

<p>This application of the idea seemed so true, so in 
harmony with that other new idea, new interpretation 
of the meaning of God manifest in the flesh, that I 
felt as if a new world had opened up before me, but 
the reply to my first question continued to roll in upon 
me:</p>

<p>"Are not the toiling millions the bleeding hands 
and feet, and are not the thinkers of the ages those 
who are in advance of their time, the thorn-crowned 
temples? is not the wormwood and the gall ever 
being pressed to the lips of such thinkers, and further, 
is not the war-demon ever thrusting the soldier's spear 
into the side of this crucified God, this grand humanity 
that is capable of so much?"</p>

<p>I was awed into silence, and then my thoughts 
turned upon her whom I had always heard spoken of as 
an Infidel, and I said to myself: "If she is an Infidel 
where are the Christians?" Again a silence while the 
words: "A crucified God," "God manifest in the flesh," 
kept flitting through my brain. Soon again I felt the 
thought of what, as before said, was my other self or 
an unseen presence independent of myself. I say felt, 
for I heard no sound but the words were as distinct as 
though I had. Perhaps it would be better to say I saw 
them.</p>

<p>"There are two things needed to secure the salvation, 
or elevation of the race, power and wisdom. We 
need the power to do, and the wisdom to know what to 
do."</p>

<p>"And where is the office of love," I asked, "I had 
supposed that to be the redeeming power."</p>

<p>"Love is the creative power; wisdom the true redeemer, 
and yet they cannot be separated, but we have 

<!-- page 15 -->

the love already&mdash;love crucified. The allegory, for it is 
only that, makes Jesus the God of love and then crucifies 
him. But there was a resurrection, and that resurrection 
is typical of what must come to the race, a rising 
out of the grave of ignorance into the light of knowledge, 
of wisdom.</p>

<p>"The resurrected Christ will not appear till in the 
fullness of time, or till the sufferings, the sad experiences 
of mankind have evolved the wisdom which will save 
us from such experiences, and in the meantime the suffering 
goes on evolving its lessons. This idea is symbolized 
by the words: 'The sufferings of Christ are fulfilled 
in his members.' "</p>

<p>"And his members are those of the church," I said.</p>

<p>"Not so. The members of that body are the whole 
human family, in the heart of every one of which is 
love enough to save a world if love alone could do it. 
Who can measure the mother's love for her child, but 
oh how it has been crucified! But this love-God is slowly 
rising and will eventually become the wisdom-God, 
God manifest in the flesh, and then we shall have an 
evoluted, a fully unfolded redemption."</p>

<p>There was no more, and indeed I do not think I could 
have borne any more then, but all through that 
week I kept revolving in my mind what I had heard.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 16 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER II.</p>

<p>The next Sabbath morning I went to church as 
usual, but somehow, what the minister said seemed 
tame. I was so little interested I remained at home in 
the afternoon, and then I remembered the book aunt 
had given me. I had not even looked at it. I would 
get and read it. When I took off the wrapper I read:</p>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">the strike of a sex</span>."</p>

<p>"What a queer title," was my thought, but I opened 
it and began to read. Page after page was scanned, 
becoming more and more interested as I progressed 
with the reading, and I did not put it down till the last 
page was finished. I then lay down upon the lounge 
and tried to think; but soon I became restless and 
thought I would take a walk, so I arose, threw a veil 
over my head and passed out the back door through the 
garden and turned my steps toward the woods.</p>

<p>I walked on for some time without noticing that the 
country through which I was passing was new, and 
when I did it did not disturb me in the least, and I still 
continued to go forward. Presently, as I ascended a 
little eminence, I found myself overlooking a vast upland 
plain, upon the border of which I was standing, 
and near me on the right I saw a man dressed in officer's 
uniform and holding a trumpet in his hand. As 
I looked he raised the trumpet to his lips.</p>

<p>"Please don't blow?" I heard a voice say, and I 
noted that the words were an entreaty, the tones a 
command.</p>

<!-- page 17 -->

<p>I turned to see from whence the voice proceeded, 
and near me stood a woman in whom was embodied all 
I had ever imagined, and more, of womanly beauty, 
dignity, and power. As I looked upon her I did not 
wonder that the tones of her voice were commanding, 
for her very presence was both a benediction and a 
command; a benediction in that I too was a woman, 
and a command to make my womanhood a blessing to 
the world.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" I involuntarily asked.</p>

<p>"I am the embodied spirit of motherhood; men call 
me Lovella," was her gracious reply.</p>

<p>The man who held the trumpet had paused and 
was looking at her. "Why may I not blow?" he asked 
at length.</p>

<p>"Why would you blow?" was her response.</p>

<p>"I would summon the warriors of the nation to defend 
its honor and prevent its disruption."</p>

<p>"And the cost of all this," she queried, keeping her 
eye fixed upon him.</p>

<p>"The cost," he repeated, looking as though that 
was nothing so that the object was accomplished.</p>

<p>"Yes, the cost," she persisted, "not to you but to 
the people; they must pay the bill, you reap the reward."</p>

<p>The man made no reply to this but looked as if he 
wondered who this woman was who thus presumed to 
question him.</p>

<p>She continued: "For the sake of a false standard 
of honor you would imbue the nation in blood. To 
preserve an unbroken union to rule over you would 
make thousands of widows and orphans. A compact of 
states that must be enforced by the sword had better be 
broken."</p>

<!-- page 18 -->

<p>"You are uttering treason; you are an anarchist," 
he said, again raising the trumpet to his lips.</p>

<p>Lovella stepped nearer and laid her hand on his 
arm. "If you blow, I must," she said. I then saw attached 
to her girdle a trumpet of wonderful workmanship 
upon which was inscribed "The Power of Mother 
Love." Emboldened by the kindness of her smile I 
stepped forward to examine it more closely, when I 
found it to be composed of myriads of hearts closely 
cemented by intertwining fibres.</p>

<p>The man paused again and stood looking at 
the woman.</p>

<p>"Yes, only a woman," she said, in response to 
his look, "but a woman in earnest. Does it surprise 
you, sir, that woman who has hitherto worked with 
man, thought with man, depended upon man, should 
now begin to work for herself and her children?"</p>

<p>"But why should she work against man to do this?"</p>

<p>"In self-defense and in defense of her children."</p>

<p>"In self-defense! why man is woman's natural 
protector."</p>

<p>The look upon Lovella's face when he said this 
was simply indescribable. I could think of nothing but 
Whittier's lines:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"With a scorn in her eye that the gazer could feel,
Like the glance of the sunshine when it flashes on steel."</p>

</div>

<p>and nothing but the steel of supreme self-assurance 
could have withstood that look without flinching. Still 
her reply was as even, as gentle in tone as though 
speaking to a little child.</p>

<p>"How has man protected us? Where are my sons? 
Where are my daughters?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Where are they? is not the land full of them?"</p>

<!-- page 19 -->

<p>"Not all of my sons are here&mdash;five hundred thousand 
of those who went, at your command, to war with 
their brothers, have left their bones to whiten southern 
battle fields, or they have been buried beneath southern 
soil, and yet you would summon the demon of war to 
devour still more of them."</p>

<p>The great, strong man quailed before the eye of this 
woman, still he would not yield.</p>

<p>"Your sons," he said, "you have counted the rebels. 
Do you, madam, claim as sons those who fell fighting 
against the flag of our nation and still call yourself a 
daughter of Freedom?"</p>

<p>"I am not the daughter but the mother of Freedom, 
and you chain her continually; but what of those who 
were on the other side, my fair sons of the north?"</p>

<p>"They died nobly, died defending the flag of their 
country."</p>

<p>"Ah, but they died, were killed, shot down, were 
starved to death."</p>

<p>Her look forced a reply. "Yes, they died," he repeated 
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Then where was their protection, where the protection 
of their wives from widowhood, their children 
from orphanage?"</p>

<p>"It is of no use to argue with a woman," he said, 
and he lifted his trumpet to his lips and blew long and 
loud. As he did this Lovella blew also, and strange to 
say the sound of her trumpet drowned that of his.</p>

<p>The man did not seem to realize this till he had 
blown a second blast, and then finding that her work 
neutralized his he attempted to take her trumpet from 
her. She only smiled at the futile attempt and waited.</p>

<p>He blew again. She did the same, and at the same 

<!-- page 20 -->

moment, but this time she sent out a peculiar note the 
sound of which had hardly died away when I saw myriads 
of women coming from every direction. They 
soon filled one-half the vast plain, while a group of the 
most advanced among them, judging from their appearance, 
surrounded the tall "Spirit of Motherhood."</p>

<p>"My daughters," she said, "who of you are willing 
to yield up your sons to fight the sons of other mothers?"</p>

<p>There was no response only by their expressive 
looks. Lovella persisted: "Will you not make your wishes 
known in this matter?"</p>

<p>This time the cry was: "No more war, no more 
war."</p>

<p>"Wait," said the man, "do not decide hastily; do 
not force us to antagonize you; think upon this matter 
before you decide. What has become of your spirit of 
patriotism, of that self-sacrifice which has hitherto 
made women so lovely?" but again the cry was heard, 
"No more war."</p>

<p>For a little time there was silence, and as I looked 
upon the vast multitude I remarked to one standing 
near me, "another 'Strike of a Sex.' "</p>

<p>"Strike," she said, looking as though she did not 
quite understand.</p>

<p>"Yes, the time when you assembled and demanded 
the right to your own bodies."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is what you call it, a strike; well we find 
that we must demand yet more in order to make that 
concession practical. A strike, this a revolution."</p>

<p>"A sex revolution, what do you mean by that?" I 
asked. The "Strike of a sex" had astonished me, but 
this was yet more, so I awaited her reply with a mixture 
of curiosity and interest.</p>

<!-- page 21 -->

<p>"We mean that man's methods must be reversed, 
that love guided by wisdom shall take the place of 
brute force."</p>

<p>"You intend then, to take the ruling power into 
your own hands&mdash;our own hands, I suppose I ought to 
say, as I am a woman too."</p>

<p>She laughed. "You would have to say 'we intend,' 
to match your amendment, but we intend to show man 
that there is a better way and to insist that it shall be 
followed, if you call that taking the ruling power into 
our own hands. We are determined that our sons shall 
no longer be sacrificed to man's idea of national honor, 
national glory. Does killing and killing elevate nations, 
make them glorious? Does not the wail of bleeding 
hearts drown the shout of victory as well as the cry of 
defeat?"</p>

<p>"What you say is all too true," I replied, "but why 
has not this step been taken before?"</p>

<p>"Because woman has been a slave, and has believed 
that she must be one; but she is getting a taste of freedom, 
she is beginning to sense her power."</p>

<p>Here the man again made an effort to impress the 
assembled multitude of women with the importance of 
preserving this "glorious nation" intact.</p>

<p>"This nation" he said, "planted by the hand of God 
in the midst of the waters, and made great through his 
favor, shall we permit it to be dismembered by a few 
hot heads with impractical ideas&mdash;this nation which God 
has raised up to reflect his own glory, and to be a light 
to the nations of the earth&mdash;shall we permit it?"</p>

<p>"If God planted this nation," replied Lovella, "he 
does not need the blood of our sons to nourish it. 
He is able to take care of it without our help or he possesses 

<!-- page 22 -->

no God-like power, and as for his glory, will it shine the 
brighter by being reflected through blood? No, we 
have had enough of war."</p>

<p>"Very well; if this is your final decision, we must 
act without you. We thought, when we conceded what 
you asked awhile since that you would be content, but 
as we find you are not we must look after the welfare of 
that which has been committed to our care in spite of 
your protests."</p>

<p>"Committed to your care!" and again I thought of 
Whittier's lines as I saw the look upon Lovella's face. 
"How well the nations have prospered under your care, 
and how well you have cared for the mothers under 
whose throbbing hearts the nations have marched into 
existence, let history declare," she continued. "Your 
assumptions are without foundation; your methods are 
failures; something else must be tried, for war must 
cease," and the assembled multitude bowed their heads 
in assent.</p>

<p>"Who is that man?" I asked of the one with whom 
I had before spoken.</p>

<p>"His name is Selferedo, and he loves power, is 
in fact the embodied spirit of the love of power, of 
selfishness," she replied.</p>

<p>I turned my eyes toward the beautiful woman 
who stood confronting Selferedo so firmly and yet so 
quietly, and asked: "Why is she called Lovella?"</p>

<p>"Because she is the embodiment, not of creating, 
but of protecting love."</p>

<p>"What," said I, "is not creating and protecting 
love one and the same?"</p>

<p>She smiled. "The quickening power which plants 
the germ," she said, "is masculine, but at conception protecting 

<!-- page 23 -->

love takes it in charge, builds its body from her 
own, thus making it so a part of herself that from 
henceforth it is her care. Look to the history of the 
past and say if the creative, the masculine principle 
protects, but hark, Selferedo speaks again."</p>

<p>I turned and heard him say: "Madam this is not 
fair; you have taken a dishonorable advantage of me by 
drowning the sound of my trumpet with your own. 
Your followers are here, but you have prevented the 
calling of mine."</p>

<p>"You have had time enough to call yours since 
mine came, why have you not done so, sir?"</p>

<p>"Because I expected you would continue to do 
as you had already done, madam."</p>

<p>"Try it, sir."</p>

<p>He lifted his trumpet and blew a blast that seemed 
to me loud enough to raise the dead. Presently I saw 
coming from all directions multitudes of men, but they 
seemed surprised when they saw their mothers, wives, 
sisters and daughters there. "Why are you here," they 
asked, "your places are in our homes." No reply was 
made to this, but Selferedo said:</p>

<p>"I have summoned you, my sons, to the defense of 
your country. If you would protect your homes you 
must repel the invader. All are not needed, so we will 
cast lots as to who shall go."</p>

<p>They began to prepare for the casting of the lots 
when Lovella called upon them to listen to her. This 
Selferedo tried to prevent but she said: "Sir, you accused 
me awhile since of unfairness; you have talked to 
the daughters, why may I not talk to the sons? Have 
I not the right?" she asked appealing to those who had 
gathered at Selferedo's call.</p>

<!-- page 24 -->

<p>"You have, and we will listen to your words," was 
the general response, so Selferedo was obliged to submit, 
though he did so with very bad grace.</p>

<p>"I regret," said she when silence was restored, "that 
I must correct the statement that has been made to 
you. It is false; our homes are not in danger; a 
portion of this confederation of states has decided upon 
an independent government. This you know was done 
once before, not by these same states, nor for the same 
reason, and they were forced back by sword and cannon, 
but at what a cost. Five hundred thousand of our best 
men gave their lives; heart-breaking wails of agony 
went up from hundreds of thousands of homes; widowed 
wives, orphaned children, maimed men filled the land 
through all its borders&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But our flag was preserved intact," cried several voices.</p>

<p>"Intact, with blood dripping from all its folds! intact, 
does that restore the dead to life, does that heal 
broken hearts!" she replied.</p>

<p>There was no response to this and she continued: 
"Now as then, our homes are not in danger; now as 
then we shall be the aggressors; now as then we shall 
invade other homes if you consent to this war. Let 
them go in peace. If they can do better alone we have 
no right to prevent it, and if they cannot they will come 
back of themselves if we leave the way open."</p>

<p>Then, in turn, Selferedo harangued them, brought 
to bear all the motives, all the influences he could summon. 
He talked to them of patriotism, of national 
honor, of their duty to their country, and while he 
yet held their attention he said: "We will not cast lots 
but will trust to your patriotism, to your love of country 

<!-- page 25 -->

and call for volunteers; all who are willing to resist this 
attempt to dismember our common country will please 
step to the front."</p>

<p>There was a moment's hesitation, then one, and 
another, and another took their places, even till there 
was enough for an army. Selferedo smiled triumphantly. 
"We have enough," he said.</p>

<p>Lovella turned to the women. "Will the wives, 
sisters, mothers and daughters of these men come to 
their sides," she asked.</p>

<p>Immediately there went from among the women to 
the sides of those men a number fully equal to their 
own. The men looked up inquiringly. "We have come 
to go with you," they said in reply.</p>

<p>"No you cannot go, we do not want women," said 
Selferedo. "No, no, you must not go," said those 
fathers, brothers, husbands, and sons.</p>

<p>"We shall go if you do," was the firm but quiet 
reply.</p>

<p>"But we will not let you go."</p>

<p>"Then you will kill us, for if you go we shall or 
die in the attempt."</p>

<p>I realized then as never before the possibilities of 
the power of woman's love.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 26 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER III.</p>

<p>"But <i>we</i> won't let you go." I saw then as I never 
before the assumption of the position that man takes; 
taking it for granted as he does, that he is woman's 
rightful ruler. If "and he shall rule over thee," was 
pronounced upon woman as a curse, the sooner she repudiates 
such rule the sooner will that curse be lifted. 
However there was not much assurance in the faces of 
the men there present when wives, mothers, sisters and 
daughters made that declaration. I never saw such an 
expression. They were speechless with astonishment.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" said Selferedo, looking at 
Lovella as if he would like to annihilate her.</p>

<p>"It means, sir, that we are in earnest; it means 
that we do not intend that the men shall be killed off 
till large numbers of our women must live alone or violate 
the law."</p>

<p>"Or violate the law." he repeated inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes; you men make the laws, and you say that 
a man can have but one wife, which is right in itself, 
is Nature's law where you do not violate her conditions, 
and then you declare war and the men many of them, 
are killed: is that not practically decreeing an equal 
number of women to celibacy or a violation of natural 
law and legal statue?"</p>

<p>Selferedo looked as if a new, but unacceptable light 
was dawning on his mind. He evidently felt the force 
of what she said and could not readily reply to her 

<!-- page 27 -->

argument, and she continued:</p>

<p>"In view of all this we have decided that if you 
go to war we will go with you, that we will share danger 
and death by your sides, that what God hath joined together, 
we will not permit you to put asunder."</p>

<p>"And leave your children, such of you as have 
children, motherless!"</p>

<p>"Why not," she asked. "If you go to war to kill 
other children's fathers or be killed yourselves, we 
will go too, and will kill other children's mothers or 
be killed ourselves."</p>

<p>Selferedo and those with him looked horrified. He 
opened his lips as if to speak, then closed them again; 
at length he gasped in the same words he had used before, 
"What does this all mean!"</p>

<p>"It means that the crucified God is rising from his 
tomb."</p>

<p>"Not much God in woman's going to war," he retorted.</p>

<p>"You do not understand; men cannot," said Lovella 
gently. "Woman represents the love element of the 
God-forces in Nature. Hitherto it has been a negative, 
a yielding, and consequently a crucified love. The 
love in woman's heart has suffered till its latent power 
is aroused, so aroused that it demands redemption or 
extinction; we repudiate eternal torture."</p>

<p>"Eternal torture," I repeated to myself, "surely 
woman's life has been little else."</p>

<p>Selferedo did not seem to know what to say to this, 
but as Lovella made no further remark, he at length 
asked: "And how much more are you going to demand? 
As I said awhile ago, when we conceded what you demanded 
in what you call a 'Strike of a Sex,' we supposed 

<!-- page 28 -->

you would leave us alone so far as our way of doing 
things is concerned."</p>

<p>"I believe you graciously conceded us the right to 
our own bodies," she said in reply.</p>

<p>"We resigned all rights as husbands and put 
ourselves in the place of dependents upon your favor."</p>

<p>"What right have you then to demand that we shall 
bear sons who must go to war, must kill or be killed. 
If we have the right to our own bodies how dare you ask 
us to use them as gestating rooms for sons who must 
be reared as marks for bullets or for cannon balls?"</p>

<p>"So you intend to separate from us again unless 
we grant what you demand?"</p>

<p>"Have not these said they will go with you, and 
die with you, if need be?"</p>

<p>"But that is what we do not want."</p>

<p>"Why not say then in so many words that you want 
us to rear sons as an offering to the war demon, and 
daughters whose husbands are likely to be torn to pieces 
to satisfy that governmental pride which is ready to 
immolate its citizens on the altar of national ambition. 
If you persist in declaring war this is what you mean 
and why not say it?"</p>

<p>"You are Anarchists, you do not believe in government."</p>

<p>"Wait till you have given us a just government before 
you accuse us of being opposed to government as 
such. A just government will be a permanent one, you 
can rest assured of that."</p>

<p>Again Selferedo was silent, while the vast concourse 
of both men and women stood waiting the result. At 
length he said: "But you have not told us how much 
more you intend to demand."</p>

<!-- page 29 -->

<p>"How much do you think we ought to demand to 
make things as they should be?" She smilingly asked. 
To this there was no reply.</p>

<p>Lovella now turned to the men, who, enthused by 
Selferedo's eloquence, had volunteered for the war and 
asked: "What will you do?"</p>

<p>"What can we do? we cannot see these dear ones die."</p>

<p>"You have enlisted and you cannot go back; desertion 
is death," thundered Selferedo in his most commanding 
tones.</p>

<p>"Then we must die for fight we will not," was the 
equally positive response.</p>

<p>"And we will die with you," said mothers, wives, 
sisters and daughters.</p>

<p>"No," said Selferedo, "we do not war on women."</p>

<p>"When you take away fathers, sons, husbands and 
brothers you do war on us, and you cannot prevent our 
dying if they die."</p>

<p>Then there arose a great cry from the men who had 
not enlisted, and from the women who were with them. 
They said: "These shall not die for we will not permit 
it."</p>

<p>Selferedo trembled for he saw that his power was 
gone, while Lovella said: "War does not tend to the 
elevation of humanity; on the contrary it brutalizes, 
drags us down. Its results are evil and only evil, therefore 
we demand that war shall cease, shall our demand 
be accorded?" and from the vast concourse of men 
came the response clear and strong: 'Your demand 
shall be accorded.' But Selferedo stood silent and rebellious. 
Lovella read his thought and said:</p>

<p>"You mistake in believing that the glory of our nation 
has departed because we ignore an insult rather 

<!-- page 30 -->

than fight. National duelists are no more honorable 
than are individual duelists and the creed of honor once 
held by them has long since been discarded by gentlemen, 
by all honorable men. The real glory of our 
nation has but just commenced; from henceforth the 
nations of the earth will look to us as taking the lead 
in beating swords into ploughshares and spears into 
pruning hooks."</p>

<p>"More bible," was my thought, and indeed, Lovella 
seemed to be very familiar with that book, and how 
much her ideas were like aunt Hobart's, yet aunt was 
called an Infidel. I wish we had more such Infidels. 
What she and Lovella thought seemed to me to be the 
highest kind of fidelity to truth, seemed like the butterfly 
as compared with the worm when put beside past 
teachings; but, comments aside, I must go on with my 
story.</p>

<p>Selferedo replied to Lovella's gentle words with: 
"Time will tell if a nation ruled by women can maintain 
its position. Judging by her yielding nature, such 
a nation will become the prey of surrounding nations, 
will be picked to pieces and divided amongst them; 
what does woman know of government?"</p>

<p>"Judging from the past, you mean; you forget 
that she is becoming a positive power."</p>

<p>"If she becomes a positive power, in what will her 
methods differ from man's? How can she maintain 
her positive position without the sword?"</p>

<p>"You forget, sir, that positiveness and aggressiveness 
are not one and the same thing, even as force and 
power are not the same. We pay the nations the compliment 
of believing them capable of being swayed by 
moral weapons, if skillfully handled. Besides, as to 

<!-- page 31 -->

woman's knowledge of government, has man evolved 
one that is satisfactory?"</p>

<p>To this Selferedo, as before, made no reply, and she 
continued:</p>

<p>"Man has had the control of affairs in all of the 
ages of the past; is it more than fair that there should 
be а sex revolution?"</p>

<p>"А sex revolution, what do you mean by that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Let the subservient sex become the dominant one 
for a time. Man's forte is force, woman's love; suppose 
that force yields the reins to love?"</p>

<p>"Love is a syren; her dalliance leads to death if 
followed too far," he said contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Alas," she replied, "how little you men understand 
love! With woman in the lead, love's true law 
will be learned, and man will cease to grovel in the 
dust of passion, unsanctified either by moral purpose 
or spiritual life. Then the central, the creative love, 
out of which all other loves spring, will become a refining 
instead of a consuming fire. It will then be like 
the bush that Moses saw, which burned and was not consumed, 
a glorifying fire, an uplifting power, a quickener 
in our search after truth."</p>

<p>The man's reply was a sneer with the words: "Oh, 
you are very beautiful, but you cannot move me, if you 
can these others," indicating with his hand the men assembled, 
"and though defeated now I bide my time."</p>

<p>"And so can I, to be understood" said Lovella with a 
sigh, "but I will now try to tell what we demand. I do 
not like the word, demand, but as you have not heeded 
our requests, our pleading tears, the force of self-assertion 
must be overcome by the force of love's assertion. 

<!-- page 32 -->

We will conquer or die, not for ourselves, but for humanity, 
so I say we demand. You have conceded to us 
on the war question, for that it was evil did not need to 
be proven, and the how to remove it was already plain.</p>

<p>"But there are other evils that the way to cure them 
is not yet plain. We demand, no ask, for if they will 
not do so we must study them alone&mdash;we ask that our 
brothers study these questions with us, and when the 
cause of any evil is found, its working clearly understood, 
we then demand that said cause be removed at no matter 
what cost, for in the end, its removal will always cost 
less than its continuance."</p>

<p>"That is, we men must be put in leading strings," said 
Selferedo, scornfully.</p>

<p>"Why not;" she replied. " 'With what mete ye measure 
it shall be measured to you again' is a law of nature. 
One extreme must bring the other before the balance 
comes.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="stanza">"For ages past the men have led
    In church, and state, and home,
And battlefields have strown with dead
    To gild ambition's dome,
But now the great transition comes,
    Earth's slaves are being freed,
Love's light is kindling in our homes,
    With woman in the lead,"</p>

</div>

<p>is the language of one of your own sex, is the declaration 
of a sex revolution and we propose to make it good, 
to practicalize it."</p>

<p>"So you propose to run this world for the ages to come, 
do you?"</p>

<p>Lovella gave him a look such as a mother might give 
to a wayward child: "No Selferedo, only till a balance 
is restored, then we can go on together," she said.</p>

<!-- page 33 -->

<p>"And how long, suppose you, will it take to bring the 
balance you talk of," he asked in the same sneering tone 
in which he had so often spoken.</p>

<p>"Live for us as we have lived for you; give us the 
aid of your earnest thought, knowing the while, that the 
decision rests with us, say fifty years, and if the changes 
that we bring are not for the better, we will then concede 
you your old place."</p>

<p>"Fifty years," he repeated to himself, "fifty years, just 
like a woman's calculation; what can they accomplish 
in that length of time," then aloud: "Well, it shall be 
so; if you think you can do so much in half a century, 
you shall have the chance to test your power."</p>

<p>"And the credit of what we do will be yours as much 
as ours, for you have prepared the materials for our 
work, we shall only arrange it. We could not do what 
we wish to do but for what you have done."</p>

<p>"If it is creditable," added Selferedo, "we will share 
the credit with you."</p>

<p>"Would you prefer that it be otherwise than creditable," 
asked Lovella, looking him calmly in the 
face.</p>

<p>"We shall see," he said again, "but remember, it is 
but fifty years, and at the end of that time I think you 
will have discovered your folly, if not long before."</p>

<p>There came a sort of mist before my eyes just then, 
a hazy appearance which I involuntarily tried to brush 
away. The effort seemed to intensify the difficulty and 
I wondered what was the matter. Presently things 
cleared but the scene had changed. Instead of a plain 
filled with women, or even half filled, I was looking 
into a very large room in which there was a number of 
both sexes.</p>

<!-- page 34 -->

<p>Lovella and Selferedo were there, and I seemed to 
have the power to look into the very soul of the latter. 
Externally he was as pleasant and agreeable as a man 
can make himself when he has a purpose to accomplish, 
which he does not wish to have known. To all outward 
appearance he was as anxious to have Lovella's plans 
succeed as though they were his own. His manner 
said: "Fair queen, I am your servant for the next 
fifty years, and well may you prosper," but the internal 
thought was, "yes, your plans shall be carried out and 
proven so foolish that we men will never have any 
more trouble from that source. Woman's rights will 
be a thing of the past, will have been thrown into the 
waste basket of rejected schemes, and from thence forth 
woman will fall back into her proper place, glad 
to yield the lead to us."</p>

<p>I looked to see if any of the others felt as Selferedo 
did. Of the some two or three dozen men present 
there were five who held positions of wealth and honor, 
were chosen rulers of the people. Of these, four 
shared Selferedo's feelings, while the other one really 
hoped that with "woman in the lead," something better 
would come to humanity. "Four of the five only care 
for themselves," was my silent comment, when, as if 
in answer to the thought, I heard the words:</p>

<p>"How hardly shall they who have riches enter into 
the kingdom of heaven."</p>

<p>I turned to see who had spoken, and if ever there was 
a divine man in human form, here was one. I looked 
at him inquiringly, but was too much awed to speak.</p>

<p>"Yes," he repeated, "the kingdom of heaven, the 
kingdom of love with wisdom as a devoted counterpart. 
The prophecy of a new heaven and a new earth is no 

<!-- page 35 -->

idle dream, but the conditions which will make things 
new here must be the work of woman, must be born of 
woman."</p>

<p>Emboldened by his kindly manner I asked: "Would 
you accept woman as leader?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly; woman alone can lead man to the 
divinest heights. Man was first, but the fact that he was 
incomplete without her showed that he needed a leader. 
He will finally accord her her true place."</p>

<p>"It would indeed be a grand woman who could lead 
you," was my thought.</p>

<p>"Yes, grand, and more than that, is she to whom I 
owe so much," he said in response, "but listen and 
learn." Saying this he vanished.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 36 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p>When I had in a measure recovered from my surprise, 
I heard Selferedo saying:</p>

<p>"Fifty years will soon be gone; if you would accomplish 
anything worth the while you, or I should say, we, 
must work fast."</p>

<p>"The best way to facilitate a work is first to understand 
it," replied Lovella.</p>

<p>"And what do you propose, my fair commander?"</p>

<p>"First of all a thorough investigation of the machinery 
of society, both as to its separate parts, and as to 
its relations, the effect of one part upon another; and 
here is where we want the aid of the best, the broadest, 
the wisest minds of both sexes."</p>

<p>I could see that Selferedo was not well pleased, but he 
smilingly asked: "And how much of your precious 
time must we devote to this work of investigation?"</p>

<p>"Enough to master the subject, five, perhaps ten 
years."</p>

<p>"But there are some evils, dear lady, the causes of 
which are so plain there is no need that time be spent 
to investigate. The fifty years, as I have already said, 
will soon pass, and I should like to see something done 
that will tell upon the future. If we can do enough in 
that time, with 'woman in the lead' to demonstrate her 
fitness to lead, then there is no more to be said. She 
will have proved her place. Yet it appears to me like 
assuming a great deal for her to make the attempt when 
the best men of the ages have failed to remedy the 

<!-- page 37 -->

evils that seem to be inseparable from human nature."</p>

<p>"You forget," she said, "what you men have already 
done. But for that, we could do no more than the 
squaw of the wigwam could do if such a work were proposed 
to her. You have been so intent, however, in 
evolving wonders from nature's storehouse that you 
have overlooked their proper adjustment. It takes 
months to prepare the land, particularly if it be timbered 
land, and months more for the wheat, corn, 
potatoes, and whatever else is needed for a good meal, 
to grow and ripen, but when all is ready the housewife 
will prepare the meal in an hour.</p>

<p>"Fifty years, it is true, is but an hour compared with 
the time you have worked, but with your aid we expect 
in that time to be able to satisfy some of the hunger 
that now prevails."</p>

<p>"I do not think that hunger prevails, or that it ever 
has to any great extent," said Selferedo. "Now and 
then someone may fail in getting enough to eat, but 
compared with the whole people the cases are very rare, 
and if they were known a supply would be forth coming. 
Generally, when such cases do occur, it is the 
party's own fault, and there is the county house to go 
to, if nowhere else."</p>

<p>Lovella sighed, when she found that Selferedo only 
thought of physical hunger. "The county house is but 
a sorry refuge at its best," she said, "but there are 
other kinds of hunger than that demanding physical 
food. Heart hunger, soul hunger, spiritual starvation 
prevail everywhere, and these result from a lack of 
balance in societary relations, and from our ignorance 
of the finer forces of nature in their adaptation to soul 
needs."</p>

<!-- page 38 -->

<p>Selferedo seemed very much surprised at the idea of 
spiritual starvation. "Why, really," he said, "I cannot 
understand you. Spiritual starvation, and church 
spires pointing heavenward from every village in the 
country. Surely, we are a very religious people."</p>

<p>As he said this something wonderful occurred&mdash;something 
that made me think of the magicians of Egypt. 
Lovella waved her hand and there appeared before us 
a most loathsome and disgusting scene, brutal men, degraded 
women, ragged children contending for the 
garbage that had been gathered from the streets. It 
was a scene from one of the slums of the metropolis of 
our country, as I afterwards learned.</p>

<p>"Look," she said. He did look and shuddered at the 
sight.</p>

<p>"How much spirituality is there in the churches 
when such places as that can exist almost beneath their 
very shadows," she asked.</p>

<p>"And do you expect to purify such places as that?" 
he asked in reply.</p>

<p>"We expect to try and that you will help us. In 
your haste to evolve great things you have knocked 
down and trampled upon my weaker children. The 
churches have no healing for such as these; not that 
their intent is not good enough, but they don't know 
how; they do not understand causes. These are 
among the things to be investigated, and these poor 
wrecks are the ones that the spirit of motherhood must 
heal as far as is possible, and at the same time must 
find out and remove the causes that have produced 
such results."</p>

<p>The conversation had so far been carried on between
Lovella and Selferedo, but Lovella now turned to the 

<!-- page 39 -->

others and said: "We will now look upon some of the 
grand things that man has done," and as she spoke 
there unrolled before their gaze immense forests that 
slowly changed into fertile fields, wigwams that gave 
place to comfortable dwellings, and still the change 
went on, till large cities, magnificent residences, storehouses 
filled with the choicest products of all lands, 
wonderful architecture, elevated railroads, hanging 
bridges, magnificent steamers, marvelous machinery, 
railroads upon which palace cars were gliding, telegraph 
and telephone lines, these were among the many 
things shown.</p>

<p>The glorious works of the artist, panoramas of scenes 
that were past, or in some other part of the globe, all 
these and more, to please the eye and charm the heart, 
while the rich melody of music and song ravished the 
ear and enthused the soul&mdash;all these, and more than 
words can express, were shown with wonderful distinctness, 
while in and out were moving with stately tread, 
or flitting, dancing along, noble looking men, beautiful 
women and lovely children, all robed in rich garments, 
and all fair to look upon.</p>

<p>And in contrast with each of these achievements of 
man's skill, there came along beside them pictures of 
what had originally been of the savage condition from 
which all this had been evolved. It was grand, and 
Selferedo's eye kindled as he looked, and then turning 
to the others, he said,</p>

<p>"With all these achievements of man so illustrated 
before us, in view of all this we are now asked, have 
pledged ourselves to give to woman the lead. What 
has woman done to deserve such a concession?"</p>

<p>At this the men present began to murmur. "Wait," 

<!-- page 40 -->

said Lovella, "there is another side to this question. 
The men who have done all this&mdash;all and much more 
than has been shown us, have all been borne beneath 
woman's heart, have been fed from her bosom and 
dandled upon her knees, while these, her sons, have 
assumed to rule over her, refusing to give her a voice 
in their counsels; is this just, my brothers?"</p>

<p>"It is not just," responded the women, but the men 
were silent. They ceased to murmur, however, because 
woman was given a trial leadership, while first 
one woman then another made some such remarks as 
these:</p>

<p>"I wonder how much of all this the men would have 
done if they had had the children to take care of." 
"Haven't we always stood by them, cared for them when 
sick and encouraged them when well, we surely deserve 
a share of the credit." "Credit, or no credit they 
couldn't do without us, could you?" said the last 
speaker, turning toward them a smiling face.</p>

<p>"We shouldn't like to try it," was the general response, 
and then one of them remarked: "We are 
waiting to have our work mapped out for us."</p>

<p>"That in good time," said Lovella; "there is enough 
to be done, but we must go to work advisedly. The 
work of the past that has succeeded was man's to do, 
and he has done it in his own way, not under woman's 
direction; on the other hand, the work that woman can 
do, has tried to do and has succeeded so poorly in the 
trying, has had to be done in man's way, and while contending 
with the adverse conditions which he has furnished. 
Civilization as it exists to-day, reflects man 
not woman. I have shown you some of the grand 
things that man has done; I will now show you some 

<!-- page 41 -->

other things&mdash;things that have resulted from the lack 
of the mother element in his work." Then there came 
into our range of vision, one by one, scenes that I can 
never forget. Dear reader, I am glad you did not 
see them, for to see and not be able to relieve is 
torture.</p>

<p>But having seen I must try to tell you, though words 
can but feebly express the misery thus portrayed. If 
the enlightened direction of mother love cannot 
change all this then there is no hope.</p>

<p>Lovella looked very sad when she proposed to show 
the other side of the picture, but after a little hesitation 
as if debating where to begin, there filed before me, before 
those assembled in that room, thousands of the 
most wretched looking women I ever saw, and upon 
whose foreheads was written the word, "prostitute," but 
above that and traced by some friendly hand, was 
written "victim."</p>

<p>"Prostitutes," I exclaimed, looking at Lovella, "I 
thought that woman abolished prostitution at the time 
of what was called the 'Strike of a Sex.' "</p>

<p>"Look again, and carefully," was the reply; then, 
as I turned to watch the long procession I saw what I 
had not noticed before, a tablet upon the breast of each 
giving the causes that had brought them into this condition.</p>

<p>I found that about one out of ten of the whole number, 
being born with strongly passional natures, and 
not finding satisfaction by marrying, had chosen this 
life in preference to the tortures of celibacy, or the unsatisfactory 
relief of solitary vice. These looked 
healthier and happier than the others, but far from being 
satisfied with their lot.</p>

<!-- page 42 -->

<p>Of the others about four tenths had been driven to 
desperation by man's perfidy, and, cast out by society, 
had rushed into prostitution as the only thing left them. 
The remaining half had been driven to it by want, and 
sold themselves to keep from starvation, to feed their 
hungry children, or perhaps an aged parent; in some 
cases all three were combined.</p>

<p>There were cases in which a loved but helpless companion 
was thus furnished with some comfort while the 
means by which it was obtained was carefully hidden 
from the sufferer, the woman thus becoming a veritable 
sacrifice to love, and beyond what man is capable of,
Christ souls in woman bodies, martyred with the supremest 
martyrdom possible to human beings; nailed 
alive to that of which the cross is but a symbol, the 
masculine organ of generation.</p>

<p>As Lovella noted my thought she said: "Man may 
be nailed to a wooden cross with spikes of iron, but woman 
groans from the torture inflicted by a cross of flesh 
and blood."</p>

<p>Her earnestness awed me, and my heart went out in 
a great wave of pity toward this unfortunate class of 
my sisters, for in all that I saw, in the lowest degradations 
I witnessed, I realized the truth of what the 
apostle Paul said. I accepted the spirit thereof though 
I should word it differently. He said, "but for the grace 
of God," I say, "but for different conditions, surroundings 
and motive powers brought to bear, I might have sunk 
to the level of the lowest."</p>

<p>When I had fully noted the causes that crowd women 
into prostitution Lovella asked. "Can you see now why 
woman cannot abolish this curse?"</p>

<p>I looked at her in a sort of dazed way, for though 

<!-- page 43 -->

partially sensing the reason I could not put it into 
words.</p>

<p>"It is the economic problem," she said. "Man controls 
the bread and butter question; that must be rightly 
adjusted first."</p>

<p>"But," said I, "woman's right to herself puts it in her 
power to demand such adjustment; she can refuse herself 
to man till he makes it."</p>

<p>"True, but they have conceded to us half a century 
of leadership, together with their sympathy and aid 
and that is much better than an attempt to force matters 
in the way you suggest. Many children, more than 
the entire population of to-day, will be born in that 
time, and some of the first born will have children, and 
even grandchildren.</p>

<p>"All these gestated under the influence of, and with 
the idea of 'women in the lead,' this together with the 
influence of mutual searching for the causes which produce 
the evils which so mar our grand civilization&mdash;searching 
for with the full determination of removing 
them&mdash;such children will be a radical improvement 
upon those gestated and born under the influence of the 
old ideas, and surely, that is a much better way of doing 
than to stand aloof and demand what man himself 
does not yet know how to grant."</p>

<p>Selferedo listened intently to what Lovella was saying 
and I saw from the change in his countenance that this 
power of heredity had not entered into his calculations, 
and his thought was: "Here is a new factor, one that 
we must neutralize in some way or she will beat us 
yet," and he centered his hopes on hurrying up, overdoing 
the matter. "Come," said he, "this philosophizing 
is all very fine, but when are we to get to work?"</p>

<!-- page 44 -->

<p>"We have already begun our work," she smilingly replied. 
"Men of sense build their homes ideally first&mdash;build 
them in their brains before putting them into visible 
shape, and women must act with equal discretion. 
We have a great work to do, and it must be idealized 
in detail before it can be actualized. Don't hurry us; 
we have waited your motion for ages&mdash;now please give 
us our own time."</p>

<p>"That would do if you had ages at your command, but 
unless you demonstrate your fitness for leadership, you 
must resign at the end of fifty years."</p>

<p>"And would you be sorry to resume your old position?" 
she asked.</p>

<p>He turned away with the first impatient movement
I had noticed since he was forced to yield to the demand
that war should cease. I think Lovella understood 
him though she gave no sign that would indicate it.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 45 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER V.</p>

<p>The next group that passed before us was that of unhappy 
wives&mdash;wives who submitted to husbands rather 
than incur greater evils. Women who were so situated 
that they must part with their children and go out 
homeless or yield in opposition to their own feelings. 
The greater portion of these were from the laboring 
classes, and as I looked upon their hollow eyes and 
sunken cheeks, as I saw that their faded appearance was 
the result of overwork and bearing unwelcome children, 
and as the effect of such conditions upon their children 
were clearly shown me I cried out in an agony of protest.</p>

<p>"Is this the outcome of the pledge that woman 
should own herself?"</p>

<p>"Do you not know," said Lovella, "that one may 
keep the letter of a pledge and yet violate its spirit? 
Our best, our noblest men, such as we may safely 
counsel with in reference to the great work to be done, 
will keep the spirit of that pledge. They will hold, not 
only the persons of their wives, but their own persons 
sacred. They will continue their respectful, lover-like 
attentions and wait the pleasure of their companions, 
realizing that mutuality is far more satisfactory than 
enforced claims, and they will thus preserve instead of 
destroying the attraction which first drew them together."</p>

<p>"But what about the others," I asked. "How is it that 
they can obey the letter and yet so violate the spirit of 
their pledge?"</p>

<!-- page 46 -->

<p>"I do not suppose," she replied, "that the husbands 
of those unhappy wives, those unwilling mothers, have 
insisted upon obedience to their desires. They have 
made no demands so far as the letter of a demand is 
concerned, but with a sort of lordly indifference they have 
said, by their manner if not in words, do as you please, 
I make no claims, but if you are free I am; I can find 
other women who will accept me, women who need my 
aid and I cannot support more than one. She knows 
that he can make her utterly wretched even if he does 
not drive her from <i>his</i> home and put another in her 
place, thus separating her from her children, so she 
yields to what seems to her the lesser evil because she 
has not the courage to face the consequences of a refusal. 
He has made no claims upon her, of course 
he hasn't, but he has compelled her to submit all the 
same.</p>

<p>"And he is not so much to blame for this; he is held 
to that plane of life by conditions he cannot break. 
His daily life is not his own. It is not the love of accomplishing&mdash;of 
evolving works of use or pleasure that 
sends him about his daily toil, not the love of the work 
of which others have the results, all but a mere subsistence, 
but hard necessity which holds him to it.</p>

<p>"He has no time to spend in intellectual enjoyment 
or to cultivate an esthetic taste. Only purely sensuous 
enjoyment and that in its crudest form is at his 
command, and his poor wife must be made to minister 
to that while the coarseness of its expression repels her 
and destroys her power to reciprocate his passion, if 
indeed, a chronic state of sexual hunger can properly 
be called passion. Poor man, he is to be pitied. Poor 
wife and poorly organized children&mdash;double victims, 

<!-- page 47 -->

victims of victims, and what is to be done?</p>

<p>"Such men know nothing of the tender care which, 
cultivating the rich fruits of the garden of love, renders 
them an increasing and perpetual delight, and thus 
they ignorantly crush the life out of earth's purest joys, 
leaving only fierce fires and ashes. What can be done 
to change all this, think you?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me," I said, "that it will take time, education, 
culture."</p>

<p>"Yes, it will take time, but how much time have these 
poor people to devote to culture, and what chance is 
there under such conditions that children will be born 
capable of a high state of cultivation when born of 
mothers who must toil during the day to the last point 
of endurance, and then satisfy, or try to, the husband's 
merely animal desire, at night; merely animal desire 
because the conditions, do not admit of any higher 
feeling, and this during all the time that the poor wife 
is from her own poorly cared for body feeding another 
life. Besides, what kind of influences do her surroundings 
send along the line of her nerves to the coming 
one? Garrets, cellars, bare walls, coarse food and 
clothing are not very likely to furnish the elements for 
a high order of offspring."</p>

<p>She paused and looked at me in a way which made 
me feel that she desired some expression from me as to 
where the trouble lay.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," I said in reply, "that this evil, like 
the other, is rooted in our false system of property relations. 
Those whose toil produces the wealth of the 
world do not get their share."</p>

<p>"Then what is to be done?"</p>

<p>"The system itself must be changed; there is no 

<!-- page 48 -->

other way."</p>

<p>Lovella then turned to the others: "You have heard 
the reply; is it correct?"</p>

<p>The women and a majority of the men replied in the 
affirmative, while the others remained silent and 
thoughtful.</p>

<p>At this point Selferedo said: "There certainly 
can be some method of adjusting things without making 
such an entire change as your remarks seem to indicate."</p>

<p>"Please find such a method and show its feasibility 
and we shall only be too glad to adopt it," replied 
Lovella.</p>

<p>"Would not a plentiful supply of legal tender currency 
make business brisk, wages good and furnish 
employment for many hands that are now idle? This 
would apply to woman as well as man, as women now 
do almost everything that men do, and that certainly 
would give them a chance to avoid prostitution if they 
so chose, and it would greatly relieve the other conditions 
of which you speak."</p>

<p>Lovella was silent for so long a time that Selferedo 
seemed to imagine that she could find no objections to 
what he had suggested, but just as he was about to reinforce 
his views with additional arguments she said:</p>

<p>"Those who now possess the wealth would find a way 
to divert the surplus increase to themselves, and the 
wage laborer would still be tributary&mdash;would still be a 
wage slave, and slaves, as such, can never become 
cultured, refined, or morally elevated."</p>

<p>"But why, madam, would the increase necessarily 
go to the already rich?"</p>

<p>"Upon the same principle that additional blood in 

<!-- page 49 -->

an already congested human body would surely rush 
to the congested part. Our economic body is congested, 
the first thing to do is to restore the equilibrium. 
If the two kindred evils which have been portrayed 
before us were the only ones rooted in economic congestion, 
there might be some faint hope of an adjustment, 
but there are others to be considered. We will 
now look upon another scene in which it is woman that 
is still the sufferer."</p>

<p>As she said this I looked a little to the left of where 
I was standing, and I saw an immense multitude of 
women of all ages. Ae they marched slowly by I noted 
that each one plied a needle, a sewing machine or both, 
and what was more strange, each one carried with her 
an exact reflection of her surroundings. Near some 
were fireless rooms and hungry, crying children. Now 
and then these would snatch a crust of bread or some 
broken meat or cold, perhaps raw potatoes and divide 
among the crying ones reserving the smallest portion 
for themselves, and then work with renewed speed as 
if to make up for lost time.</p>

<p>Then again these would wrap the children in the 
poor apology for bed clothes and hurry out to get the 
poor pittance for their toil with which to buy a little 
coal and a little food, being careful always, if possible, 
to save something towards the rent. On, on they went 
till the line stretched far beyond my range of vision, 
and still they came, a hungry, gaunt, sorrowful multitude, 
many of them working upon rich garments, while 
the plainest, coarsest of those upon which others stitched, 
were better than they themselves could wear.</p>

<p>As one hollow eyed woman passed I felt a strange 
sensation, and looking to learn what it meant I saw 

<!-- page 50 -->

lines that connected her with the cloak I wore. "She 
made it, a portion of her life has gone into it" was my 
thought, and then such a wave of sadness, of gloom 
came flowing in upon those lines of connection and enveloped 
me as it were. It was just what she had felt while 
making the cloak.</p>

<p>Quick as thought the question came to me: "Suppose 
you were a wife and soon to be a mother would not this 
feeling be woven into the very life of your child?"</p>

<p>"Oh heaven, is this possible!" I exclaimed. Lovella 
saw and understood:</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, "it is more than possible. The 
rich cannot escape the results of the conditions imposed 
upon the poor. People recognize the fact that the 
germs of physical disease may be carried in clothing 
or bedding, but fail to recognize the equally important 
truth that moral disease can be communicated in the 
same way, and that in some cases it may thus become 
a hereditary endowment for evil."</p>

<p>I can never forget the feeling of yearning horror that 
came over me&mdash;an inexpressible pity and a yearning to 
take them out of such horrible conditions. Lovella, as 
usual, read my thought and said in response:</p>

<p>"And we must do it, it is a part of our work. It is 
because of that, that these scenes are thus portrayed. 
To do so simply to shock the beholder's feelings would 
be cruelty, but in the end we expect, intend to do away 
with all such conditions."</p>

<p>"In fifty years?" asked Selferedo in an incredulous tone.</p>

<p>"Why not?" she replied, turning her luminous eyes full 
upon him, "the materials are prepared for the new 
structure, they need only to be rightly adjusted."</p>

<p>"Ah, the materials, you give us that much credit?"</p>

<!-- page 51 -->

<p>"Most certainly, and we credit your further ability 
by acknowledging our need of your continued effort."</p>

<p>"As your servants," he replied, bowing to hide the 
mocking smile that wreathed his lips.</p>

<p>"Why not," she again asked, "did not he who is 
claimed as 'the Master,' say 'He that is greatest among 
you let him be your servant?' " There was a smile upon 
the faces of those present at this reply and Selferedo 
said no more, but one of the men who was in sympathy 
with him remarked:</p>

<p>"I suppose you will say that these also are the victims 
of our economic system."</p>

<p>"Well, are they not?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I cannot see, madam, how the system can be 
charged with the results of the selfishness of employers."</p>

<p>"The system is at fault, my dear sir, because it leaves 
the fate of the employee in the employer's hands. Any 
system which allows one class of people to make it 
impossible for another class to have direct access to 
the sources of supply is a false one, not only because of 
the dependence it involves, but because the natural 
tendency of such a system is to make the dominant 
class selfish and tyrannical."</p>

<p>"You make a good people's advocate," was the only 
reply, and he also took refuge in silence, and still the 
hollow eyed, sad faced women continued to file past.</p>

<p>"Will they never have done," said another impatiently.</p>

<p>At this there dropped over them something that was 
like a veil, thus hiding them from our sight, but Lovella 
said:</p>

<p>"As long as time lasts they must continue their 
march unless something is done to remove the causes 

<!-- page 52 -->

which make them what they are, but there are other 
armies of sufferers that we must look upon in order to 
get some idea of the magnitude of our work," and then 
there came thousands upon thousands of men, and 
some women, who were reeling and staggering with 
drunkenness.</p>

<p>Oh, the sickening sight! blear eyed, bloated, pale, 
haggard, blasphemous and obscene songs, curses and 
cunning leers, desperation, imbecility, shrieks, stolidity, 
each phase terrible in itself, but when thus combined 
the scene beggared description.</p>

<p>"That surely," said Selferedo, "is not the result of our 
economic system. Those men are not obliged to drink 
unless they choose."</p>

<p>"And what would be your remedy," asked Lovella.</p>

<p>"I would imprison every man who drank to excess."</p>

<p>"Do you believe there is any truth in the sciences of 
physiology and phrenology," she continued.</p>

<p>"Certainly, but as yet they are far from being perfect."</p>

<p>"True, but I would like to have those for whom you 
propose a prison examined by as competent physiologists 
and phrenologists as we have. I feel very certain 
that some physical or moral defect, perhaps both, 
would be found in every one of them."</p>

<p>"And you would therefore consider them irresponsible, 
is that what you mean?"</p>

<p>"In a measure, yes."</p>

<p>"That will not do, Lovella, some of the most noted 
men that have lived, died drunkards."</p>

<p>"And noted, talented men and women have died insane, 
sir, but there was some unbalanced brain condition 
or of body reacting upon the brain, which, when 

<!-- page 53 -->

a pressure was brought to bear, could not stand the 
strain, and this is equally true of the drunkard. When 
we have a knowledge of what perfect motherhood should 
be, and the conditions to carry it out, we shall have no 
drunkards and no insane people."</p>

<p>"You claim a great deal for motherhood, madam."</p>

<p>"There is a text of scripture, sir which says: 'The 
seed of a woman shall bruise the serpent's head,' did 
you ever read it?"</p>

<p>"Most assuredly I have, but I cannot see what possible 
application that can have to the subject in hand."</p>

<p>"But what meaning do you attach to the text, Selferedo?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I have not thought much about it; the Christian 
world claims Jesus as the seed of the woman."</p>

<p>"The Christian world has attached certain meanings 
to many things which a more extended knowledge has 
shown to be capable of much broader interpretations, 
and in this case I do not think it will be very difficult 
to show the application to the subject in hand."</p>

<p>"Well, please give us your interpretation," he said 
with an indulgent smile, such as self-conceited men often 
bestow upon woman while listening to her ideas.</p>

<p>Lovella took no notice of this, but proceeded to 
comply with request. "Civilization," she said, "is the 
result more of man's efforts than of woman's; not only 
is society as it exists to-day his child but the law also 
gives to him the children that woman bears. They are 
legally his, and they are his too by the quality of their 
natures, because gestated and born under conditions 
that he furnishes. They are not the seed of the woman 
and the serpent's head, figuratively speaking is everywhere 
apparent.</p>

<!-- page 54 -->

<p>"Now when our sех revolution is fully accomplished, 
then motherhood will come to the front. The children 
will then be hers. Then she will see to it that a knowledge 
of our own bodies and brains, together with that 
of the conditions under which perfect motherhood can 
be actualized&mdash;will see to it that such knowledge shall 
take precedence of all else. Then the seed of the woman 
shall bruise the serpent's head, and not till then.</p>

<p>"Now," she continued, "if you can show that our 
property system has not interfered with the best conditions 
for motherhood, then I will admit that it has had 
nothing to do with the condition of these," waving her 
hand towards the still passing wrecks of manhood and 
womanhood.</p>

<p>"The liquor traffic interferes far more with the conditions 
for perfect motherhood than does our economic 
system," was his reply to this.</p>

<p>"That the liquor traffic intensifies the evil cannot be 
denied," said Lovella, thoughtfully, "but our laboring 
men do not all drink, not all of the men who are reduced 
to the lowest degree of poverty, and the results 
to motherhood in such cases are none the less disastrous. 
But suppose it can be shown that the traffic itself, 
the greater part of it, is the result of the system 
which makes the pursuit of wealth of paramount importance, 
what then?"</p>

<p>Selferedo made no direct reply to this, and as to my 
own feelings, the most bitter thought of all was that 
what I had witnessed represented facts, that though the 
wretched ones I had seen were not exactly in marching 
line, that they were even much more numerous than 
there represented.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 55 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p>Hitherto, with the exception of Lovella and myself, 
only the men had spoken, and aside from Selferedo, 
but two of them, but at this point one of the women 
remarked:</p>

<p>"It seems to me that prohibitory laws enforcing a 
stop to the manufacture of intoxicating drinks would 
settle that question, and in view of the importance of 
the right conditions for motherhood, the fact that intoxicants 
are so destructive of all that makes a mother's
 work a blessing should be sufficient reason for the 
enactment of such a law."</p>

<p>Like a flash the army of drunkards disappeared and 
in its place stood a large city through the streets of 
which marched an army of women carrying flags and 
banners. On the latter were various inscriptions which 
read: "Down with the saloons." "Five thousand 
dens of destruction, away with them." "Two and a 
half million dollars paid annually for license to sell 
liquid fire." "Think of the cost to the people of five 
thousand saloons, and who pays it?" "What's to be 
done?" "The saloon must go." On they went with 
determination written upon their faces, and I watched 
till I saw every saloon closed.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad!" I exclaimed involuntarily.</p> 

<p>"Wait," said Lovella, and then the scene changed. 
As all liquors were worthless now, could not be sold at 
any price, it followed as a matter of course that the five 
thousand saloon keepers, together with the wholesale 
liquor dealers, were now deprived of their means 

<!-- page 56 -->

of support. We were next shown these with their wives 
and children, not less than twenty-five thousand people, 
all anxiously asking how they were going to live.</p>

<p>The most of them had been rendered utterly poor. 
True, some few owned the houses in which they lived, 
but now the taxes would be much heavier, for the two 
and a half millions of license money which had helped 
to defray the expenses of the city government must be 
raised by increased taxation and how long would their 
homes be theirs with no means of self-support.</p>

<p>This was a side of the question I had not thought of. 
Lovella seemed to possess the power of illuminating 
that which she wished to teach. She said not a word as 
by a wave of her hand one scene after another was 
brought before us. More than five thousand men 
wanting employment and not five hundred vacant 
places in the whole city, and these but temporarily, 
for there were enough others to more than fill them, 
others much better qualified than an ex-saloon keeper 
would be, and what was to be done?</p>

<p>The first scene placed before us in answer to this 
inquiry was the home of a man who supported a wife 
and six children from the proceeds of a corner grocery. 
His rent was very high but it would now be higher. 
The taxes being increased, those who had houses to 
rent would add the tax to the price demanded for their 
use. It was all he could do now to live and if the ex-saloon 
keeper on the opposite corner took up the 
grocery business he must go under; there was no help 
for it.</p>

<p>He did not speak, but by some occult law his 
thoughts were made visible. The ex-saloon man did 
start a grocery upon a small scale. He must do something 

<!-- page 57 -->

in order to live, and he trusted to his customers 
in the old business to patronize him in this. He 
struggled along nearly a year and then failed, but not 
till the competition, the division of the trade had so 
involved the old grocery keeper that he could not rally.</p>

<p>On, on we followed this family from one downward 
step in misfortune to another. Having lost his hold 
the man could not regain his footing; and finally, with 
his wife dead, and his children scattered, he filled a 
suicide's grave. True his fate was no worse than that 
of many the cause of which could be traced to saloons, 
and the woman who had advised the prohibitory law 
said as much, when Lovella replied, and most emphatically:</p>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">we want a cure, not a change of evils</span>."</p>

<p>The next scene shown us was the career of the ex-saloon 
keeper. Slowly it was unrolled at one end and 
rolled up at the other till at last the man sat with a kit 
of burglar's tools by his side, and in reply to his wife's 
remonstrance he said: "I cannot see you and the 
children starve, and everything else that I have tried 
has failed. By some sort of hocus pocus some people 
get all there is and if I am sharp enough to get some of 
it back I don't see that I am so much worse than other 
folks."</p>

<p>Next we saw the family gathering up their household 
goods and taking a western train. We saw the husband 
and the oldest son leave at the first station and 
return to the city in disguise; we saw them go to the
 house of a rich merchant who was known to be absent, 
and entering by means of their burglar's tools, gather 
together such valuables as they could find. They 

<!-- page 58 -->

hoped to get away without being discovered, but when 
they left two women lay dead upon the floor and the 
house was on fire. They escaped and were never 
traced.</p>

<p>"Now," said Lovella, when this last scene disappeared, 
"multiply these cases, with varying shades of 
detail, a thousand fold and you will have some of the 
results of a forced closing of the saloons <i>under</i> our 
present property system. You may think the pictures 
overdrawn, but I can assure you they are not."</p>

<p>"Then you would leave the liquor traffic untouched," 
said Selferedo.</p>

<p>"I would go to the root of things and remove the 
causes which create a demand for liquor and then the 
traffic would cease of itself; but there is yet more to be 
shown of the results of an enforced morality," and 
again she waved her hand.</p>

<p>There now came into view some fifty cottages occupied 
and partly owned by laboring men. These homes 
were being paid for in monthly installments, and with 
no bad luck, would in another year be wholly theirs. 
Not one of these men drank, and but few of them used 
tobacco. I felt a shrinking as I gazed, for with the 
previous scenes before my mind I sensed what was 
coming.</p>

<p>Presently I saw those men returning from their work 
with saddened faces. They tried to put on a smile as 
they entered their homes but their wives saw that something 
was the matter and began to question them; then 
it all came out.</p>

<p>The ex-saloon men, in order to get work were underbidding 
them, and unless they would consent to work 
for less wages they were likely to lose their places and 

<!-- page 59 -->

with them all hope of paying for their homes. If they 
consented to work for less they could still secure bread 
for themselves and families, but the prospect of saving 
their homes was but little better.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that I could bear no more. The 
idea of those men losing their homes went through me 
like a knife. But the worst part of it was, I could see 
that such a result was but the natural sequence of our 
economic law under such circumstances. If our earnest 
workers for reform would only try to trace the 
reaction as well as the action of the forces they set in 
motion they would work to better purpose, because they 
would work more wisely than they now do.</p>

<p>We were shown a few more scenes all involving the 
same lesson and then Lovella said:</p>

<p>"In the scene wherein the laboring men were shown 
to be in danger of losing their homes, together with 
others thus affected, you may multiply your fifty by 
thirty and not overstate the number of homes lost to 
honest worthy men because of the breaking up of conditions 
caused by forcibly closing the saloons in one 
city only, and when the whole cost is counted, when all 
who suffer by this change are considered, you will find 
that the evil designed to be removed presents itself in 
other forms and the sum of the misery produced is even 
greater than before.</p>

<p>"True, there are many, very many cases of rejoicing, 
scenes of gladness which, if portrayed, and the other 
side not shown, would be considered unanswerable 
evidence of the great good done by closing the saloons, 
but what we want is to <i>heal</i> this our great human 
patient. This driving the disease from one part of the 
body to another,

<!-- page 60 -->

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">is not a cure</span>."</p>

<p>"But you do not tell us what should be done," said 
one of the two men who had before spoken.</p>

<p>"Too many have told that before they found out 
themselves, and I am willing to wait a little; besides if 
I knew exactly the true and only method, I would only 
give out at first, such hints as would set others to 
searching for the better way, as I should want a great 
deal of <i>intelligent</i> assistance."</p>

<p>"You must remember," she continued, "that work 
well done is twice done. This subject must be thoroughly 
understood before we can adopt measures that 
will secure success. I might show you in succession 
the vast armies of the insane, the idiotic, the blind, the 
deaf and dumb, and bring up the rear with the long, 
long train of those who fill our poorhouses and our 
prisons but you have already seen enough of society's 
wrecks. Rest assured, however, that any method which 
does not reach all those will be work half done, consequently 
not done at all.</p>

<p>"Men point with pride to the asylums they furnish 
for human wrecks, thinking it an evidence of great 
humanity on their part. They do not realize in the 
least the shame of there being a need for such asylums. 
When the conditions for perfect motherhood are secured 
there will be no such need, but until woman 
revolutionizes society such conditions cannot be had.</p>

<p>"Now," she said in conclusion, "it is my wish that 
those present, acting upon the lines of thought here indicated, 
shall go forth and study the workings of society 
in all its parts, that you may arm yourselves with the 
truths which will enable us to accomplish the revolution 

<!-- page 62 -->

contemplated. Go singly, two by two, or in 
groups, but be watchful, careful, wise, and determined 
that no present nor personal interest shall for a 
moment blind your judgment.</p>

<p>"Do this, remembering what it is that you are undertaking. 
If you cannot solve the problem, if there cannot 
be formulated and put into practice a system of 
society which will not grind up one portion of its members 
for the benefit of other portions, then we might as 
well cease trying to do for others. The only thing left 
us will be to make the most of ourselves individually, 
and let those who cannot stand the pressure go down to 
be ground over in the evolution of the eternities.</p>

<p>"Study this question for the next five years, and 
then meet here to report. Till then, adieu."</p>

<p>The scene vanished and I found myself where I had 
lain down to rest after reading "The Strike of a Sex."</p>

<p>I lay for some minutes in a half dazed condition with 
Lovella's last words still ringing in my ear. 
"Yes," I said aloud, "I will go with the others," and 
that fully awakened me.</p>
