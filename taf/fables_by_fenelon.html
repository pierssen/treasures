<h2>Introduction.</h2>

</div>

<p>This little book was composed by F&eacute;nelon for the education of
the Duke of Burgundy, to whom he was tutor.  It is a collection of
fables, reflections and short stories, written with amiable negligence,
and in which we still find the pure and gentle morality and style of
<i>Telemachus</i>.</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois de Salignac de Lamothe-F&eacute;nelon, born in 1651,
at the Ch&acirc;teau de F&eacute;nelon in Quercy, of a noble family,
entered the ecclesiastical state early, where he was immediately
distinguished by his talent for preaching.  He was one of the
missionaries appointed to work for the conversion of Protestants; and
his mission was most successful, although he employed no other weapons
than those of persuasion.</p>

<p>The Duke of Beauvilliers, governor of the Duke of Burgundy, wanted
F&eacute;nelon as his collaborator.  Thus did he arrive at court, where
he made himself respected for his virtues, admired for his talents and
loved for the infinite charms of his manners and character.  The young
prince especially was not long in feeling for his tutor an affection
which never lessened.</p>

<p>Presently a little family formed, of which F&eacute;nelon was the
spiritual father, and into which entered the Duke of Burgundy, his
governor the Duke of Beauvilliers, the Duke of Chevreuse, and even, in
the early days, Madame de Maintenon.  F&eacute;nelon's influence on the
mind of the young prince, the spiritual family of which he had become
the father, a perhaps excessive mysticism which was already apparent in
his writings, and, more than all that, certain passages of
<i>Telemachus</i> in which it was easy to see a fairly strong criticism
of the government of Louis XIV, alarmed the orthodoxy of Bossuet, then
all-powerful in the Church, and gave umbrage to the king, his mistress
and his ministers.  They resolved to separate the Duke of Burgundy
abruptly from a tutor whom he adored.  F&eacute;nelon was made
Archbishop of Cambrai:  he was forced to reside there, and remained
there as if in exile until his death, which occurred in 1715.</p>

<p>From the depths of his diocese, F&eacute;nelon never ceased to occupy
the world.  A purely theological discussion had arisen between Bossuet
and him on the subject of Madame Guyon's doctrines on <i>pure love</i>.
A large number of writings were published on both sides; and the case
was finally brought to the court of Rome, where the Archbishop of
Cambrai was condemned.  He submitted immediately with perfect modesty
and humility, and took it upon himself to announce his condemnation from
the pulpit.  Despite everything, Louis XIV never ceased to hold it
against him; and when the Duke of Burgundy passed through Cambrai on his
way to take command of the Army of Flanders, his former master was
hardly allowed to see him for a moment and to embrace him in the
presence of his whole retinue.</p>

<p>There was, however, a moment when one could believe that
F&eacute;nelon would be called upon to play a great role in the State:
it was when the Duke of Burgundy became Dauphin by the death of his
father.  All ambitious men then took the road to Cambrai, and the
Archbishop, who had hitherto lived only among his priests, solely
occupied with good works, with the fervor of an apostle and the charity
of a saint, suddenly found himself surrounded by a veritable court.
This outburst did not last long.  The Dauphin died; and F&eacute;nelon,
struck to the heart, survived him only three years.</p>

<p>We have a large number of works by him, among which we will cite only
<i>Telemachus</i>, the <i>Letter on Eloquence</i>, the <i>Demonstration
of the Existence of God</i>, the <i>Sermons</i> and the <i>Spiritual
Works</i>.</p>

<h3>Patience and Education Correct Many Faults.</h3>

</div>

<p>A Bear had just given birth to a cub that was horribly ugly.  She did
not recognize in him any animal shape:  he was a formless and hideous
mass.  The Bear, very ashamed of having such a son, went to find her
neighbor the Crow, who was noisily cackling under a tree.</p>

<p>"What shall I do," she said to her, "my friend, with this little
monster?  I want to kill him."</p>

<p>"Calm down," said the confidant; "I have seen other Bears in the same
situation.  Come, gently lick your son; it will soon be pretty, cute and
fit to do you honor."</p>

<p>The mother wanted to believe what was said in favor of her son, and
patiently licked him for a long time.  At last, he began to become less
deformed, and she went to thank the Crow:  "If you had not eased my
impatience, I would have cruelly torn my son, who is now the apple of my
eye."</p>

<p>Oh! that impatience prevents good and causes evil!</p>

<h3>The Bee and the Fly.</h3>

</div>

<p>One day a Bee saw a Fly near her hive.  "What are you doing here?"
she told him in a furious tone.  "Really, it's uppity of you, vile
creature, to mingle with the queens of the air!"</p>

<p>"You are right," replied the Fly coldly; "it is always wrong to
approach a nation as fiery as yours."</p>

<p>"Nothing is wiser than we are," said the Bee; "we alone have laws and
a well-policed republic; we browse only fragrant flowers; we only make
delicious honey that equals the nectar of the gods.  Get out of my
presence, nasty intrusive Fly, which only buzzes and lives on
filth."</p>

<p>"We live as best we can," answered the Fly; "poverty is not a vice,
but anger is a great one.  You make honey which is sweet, but your heart
is still bitter; you are wise in your laws, but wild in your conduct;
your anger, which stings your enemies, kills you, and your mad cruelty
does you more harm than anyone."</p>

<p>It is better to be less dazzling and more moderate.</p>

<hr/>

<div class="center" id="fab03">

<h2>III.</h2>

<h3>The Two Foxes.</h3>

</div>

<p>Two Foxes entered a henhouse by stealth at night; they killed the
cock, the hens and the young chickens;<sup id="f03_ref01"><a
href="#f03_n01">1</a></sup> after this carnage, they appeased their
hunger.  One, who was young and passionate, wanted to devour everything;
the other, who was old and miserly, wanted to set some aside for the
future.</p>

<p>Said the older:  "My child, experience has made me wise; I have
seen much during my time in this world.  Let's not eat all our booty in
one day.  We made a fortune; it is a treasure that we have found, and it
must be spared."</p>

<p>The younger replied, "I want to eat it all while I'm at it, and be
full for eight days; as for coming back here, empty words!  It won't do
any good tomorrow:  the farmer, to avenge the murder of his hens, will
kill us."</p>

<p>After this conversation, each followed his own way.  The youth ate so
much, that he burst and could barely go back to his burrow to die.  The
senior, who thought himself much wiser to moderate his appetites and
live economically, returned the next day to his prey, and was beaten to
death by the farmer.</p>

<p>Thus every age has its faults:  young people are fiery and insatiable
in their pleasures; the old are incorrigible in their avarice.</p>

<h3>The Wolf and the Young Sheep.</h3>

</div>

<p>The sheep were safe in their pen; the dogs slept, and the shepherd
sat in the shade of a large elm, playing the flute along with other
neighboring shepherds.  A hungry wolf came up to the gaps in the
enclosure to scout the state of the herd.  An adolescent sheep,<sup
id="f04_ref01"><a href="#f04_n01">1</a></sup> who had never experienced
or learned anything, entered into conversation with him.</p>

<p>"What are you looking for here?" he said to the glutton.</p>

<p>"Tender, flowery grass," replied the Wolf.  "You know that nothing is
sweeter than grazing in a green meadow dotted with flowers to appease
your hunger, and going to quench your thirst in a clear stream:  I have
found both here.  What more do I need?  I love the philosophy that
teaches us to be satisfied with little."</p>

<p>"Is it true then," replied the young Sheep, "that you do not eat the
flesh of animals, and that a little grass is enough for you?  If so, let
us live as brothers and feed together."</p>

<p>Immediately the Sheep left the pen into the open meadow, whereupon
the sober philosopher tore it to pieces and swallowed it.</p>

<p>Beware of the fine words of people who boast of being virtuous.
Judge by their actions and not by their words.</p>

<h3>The Dragon and the Foxes.</h3>

</div>

<p>A Dragon guarded a treasure in a deep cave:  he watched day and night
to preserve it.  Two Foxes, great cheats and thieves by profession,
insinuated themselves to him by their flatteries.  They became his
confidants.</p>

<p>The most complacent and eager people are not the safest.</p>

<p>They called him a great personage, admired all his fancies, were
always of his opinion, and laughed secretly at their dupe.  Finally, he
fell asleep one day in the midst of them; they murdered him and seized
the treasure.  It had to be divided between them:  it was a very
difficult affair, because two scoundrels agree only to do evil.  One of
them began to moralize.</p>

<p>"What," he said, "will this money be used for?  A little hunting
would be better for us; one does not eat metal; these doubloons are bad
for the digestion.  Men are mad for loving these false riches so much:
let's not be as foolish as they are."</p>

<p>The other pretended to be touched by these reflections and assured
that he wanted to live as a philosopher, like Bias, carrying all his
wealth with him.  Both pretended to leave the treasure; but they set up
ambushes and tore each other to pieces.</p>

<p>One of them, dying, said to the other, who was as hurt as he was:
"What did you want to do with this money?"</p>

<p>"The same thing you wanted to do with it," replied the other.</p>

<p>A passing man learned of their adventure, and thought them quite
mad.</p>

<p>"You are no different," said one of the Foxes.  "You, no more than
we, can feed yourself with money, yet you kill yourself to get it.  At
least our race so far has been wise enough not to use any money.  What
you brought into your home for convenience is your unhappiness.  You
lose real goods to seek imaginary ones."</p>

<hr/>

<div class="center" id="fab06">

<h2>VI.</h2>

<h3>The Bees.</h3>

</div>

<p>A young prince, on the return of the zephyrs, when all nature
revives, was walking in a delightful garden; he heard a great noise, and
saw a hive of bees.  He approached this spectacle, which was new to him;
he saw with astonishment the order, the care and the work of this little
republic.</p>

<p>The cells were beginning to form and take on a regular shape.  A part
of the Bees filled them with their sweet nectar:  the others brought
flowers which they had chosen among all the riches of spring.  Idleness
and laziness were banished from this little state:  everything was in
motion there, but without confusion and without trouble.  The most
important among the Bees led the others, who obeyed without murmuring
and without jealousy against those who were above them.</p>

<p>While the young prince was admiring this object which he did not yet
know, a Bee, which all the others recognized as their queen, approached
him and said to him:  "The sight of our works and our conduct rejoices
you; but even more should it instruct you.  We do not tolerate disorder
or license at home; one is considerable among us only by his work and by
the talents which can be useful to our republic.  Merit is the only way
that elevates to the first places.  We occupy ourselves night and day
only with things from which men draw all the utility.  May you one day
be like us and bring into the human race the order you admire in us!
You will thus work for its happiness and yours; you will fulfill the
task that fate has imposed on you:  for you will be above others only to
protect them, only to ward off the evils that threaten them, only to
procure for them all the benefits that they have the right to expect
from a vigilant and paternal government."</p>

<hr/>

<div class="center" id="fab07">

<h2>VII.</h2>

<h3>The Assembly of Animals to Choose a King.</h3>

</div>

<p>The Lion being dead, all the animals ran to his lair to console the
Lioness, his widow, who made the mountains and the forests resound with
her cries.  After paying their compliments, they began the election of a
king:  the crown of the deceased was in the middle of the assembly.</p>

<p>The lion cub was too young and too weak to obtain the kingship over
so many proud animals.  "Let me grow," he would say; "I will know how to
reign and make myself feared in my turn.  In the meantime, I want to
study the history of my father's fine deeds, to equal his glory one
day."</p>

<p>"As for me," said the Leopard, "I claim to be crowned; for I look
more like the Lion than all the other suitors."</p>

<p>"And I," said the Bear, "I maintain that they did me an injustice
when they preferred the Lion to me:  I am strong, courageous,
carnivorous, just as much as he; and I have a singular advantage, which
is to climb trees."</p>

<p>"I leave it to you to judge, gentlemen," said the Elephant, "if
anyone can dispute with me the glory of being the biggest, the strongest
and the bravest of all animals."</p>

<p>"I am the most noble and the most beautiful," said the Horse.</p>

<p>"And I, the finest," said the Fox.</p>

<p>"And I, the lightest in the race," said the Deer.</p>

<p>"Where will you find," said the Monkey, "a king more agreeable and
more ingenious than I?  I will entertain my subjects every day.  I even
resemble man, who is the real king of nature."</p>

<p>The Parrot then harangued thus:  "Since you boast of resembling man,
I can boast of it too.  You only resemble him in your ugly face and a
few ridiculous grimaces:  as for me, I resemble him in my voice, which
is the mark of reason and the most beautiful ornament of man."</p>

<p>"Be silent, cursed talker," replied the Monkey:  "you speak, but not
like a man; you always say the same thing, without hearing what you
say."</p>

<p>The assembly laughed at these two bad copyists of man, and the crown
was given to the Elephant, because he had the strength and wisdom,
without having either the cruelty of furious beasts, nor the foolish
vanity of so many others who always want to appear to be what they are
not.</p>

<hr/>

<div class="center" id="fab08">

<h2>VIII.</h2>

<h3>The Monkey.</h3>

</div>

<p>A cunning old Monkey having died, his shadow descended into the dark
abode of Pluto, where he asked to return among the living.  Pluto wanted
to send him back into the body of a heavy and stupid donkey, to take
away his suppleness, liveliness and malice; but he did so many pleasant
and playful tricks that the inflexible king of the underworld could not
help laughing, and left him the choice of a form.  He asked to enter the
body of a Parrot.</p>

<p>"At least," he said, "I shall thus retain some resemblance to the men
I have imitated for so long.  Being a Monkey, I gestured like them, and
being a Parrot, I will talk with them in the most pleasant
conversations."</p>

<p>Hardly had the soul of the Monkey been introduced to this new trade,
when an old, talkative woman bought him.  He was her delight; she put
him in an old cage.  He had good food, and talked all day long with the
doting old lady, who spoke no more sensibly than he.  He added to his
new talent to surprise everyone something of his old profession:  he
shook his head ridiculously; he cracked his beak; he flapped his wings
in a hundred ways, and turned his legs several times, still evoking
Fagotin's<sup id="f08_ref01"><a href="#f08_n01">1</a></sup>
grimaces.</p>

<p>The old woman took her glasses off at all hours to admire him.  She
was very sorry to be a little deaf, and to sometimes miss words from her
Parrot, in whom she found more wit than in anyone else.  This spoiled
Parrot became talkative, importunate and mad.  He tormented himself so
much in his cage, and drank so much wine with the old woman, that he
died of it.</p>

<p>He wound up back in front of Pluto, who this time wanted to make him
pass into the body of a fish, to make him mute; but he still made a
farce in front of the King of Shadows, and princes hardly resist the
requests of bad jokers who flatter them.  Pluto therefore granted that
he would go into the body of a man.  But, as the god was ashamed to send
him into the body of a wise and virtuous man, he destined him to the
body of a boring and importunate haranguer, who lied, boasted
incessantly, made ridiculous gestures, made fun of everyone, and
interrupted the most polite and solid conversations only to say nothing
or the grossest nonsense.</p>

<p>Mercury, who recognized him in this new state, said to him laughing:
"Ho! ho!  I recognize you; you are only a composite of the Monkey and
the Parrot that I once saw.  Take away your gestures and your words
learned by heart and without judgment, and nothing would be left.  A
fine Monkey and a good Parrot only combine to make a stupid man."</p>

<p>Oh! how many men in the world, with formal gestures, a little cackle
and a capable air, have neither sense nor conduct!</p>

<h2>IX.</h2>

<h3>The Owl.</h3>

</div>

<p>A young Owl&mdash;who had seen himself in a fountain, and thought
himself more beautiful, I will not say than the day, because he found it
very disagreeable, but than the night, which had great charms for
him&mdash;said to himself:</p>

<p>"I sacrificed to the Graces; Venus put her <i>cestus</i> on me when I
was born; the tender ambassadors of Cupid,<sup id="f09_ref01"><a
href="#f09_n01">1</a></sup> accompanied by Games and Laughs, flutter
around to caress me.  It's time for fair Hymen to give me graceful
children like unto me; they will be the ornament of the groves and the
delights of the night.  What a pity that the race of the most perfect
birds should be lost!  Happy is the wife who will spend her life gazing
upon me!"</p>

<p>In this vein, he sent the Crow to ask on his behalf for little
Eaglet, daughter of the Eagle, queen of the air.  The Crow found it
difficult to undertake this embassy:</p>

<p>"I would be ill received," she said, "to propose such an ill-suited
marriage.  What! the Eagle, who dares to stare fixedly at the sun, would
marry you, who cannot even open your eyes while it is day! that way the
two spouses are never together; one will come out by day, and the other
by night."</p>

<p>The Owl, vain and in love with himself, did not listen to anything.
The Crow, to satisfy him, finally went to ask for Eaglet.  They laughed
at his crazy request.  The Eagle replied:</p>

<p>"If the Owl wants to be my son-in-law, let him come after sunrise to
greet me in the middle of the air."</p>

<p>The Presumptuous Owl was eager to go.  His eyes were at first
dazzled; he was blinded by the rays of the sun, and fell from the air on
a rock.  All the birds threw themselves on him, and tore his feathers.
He was only too happy to hide in his hole, and to marry another Owl, who
was a worthy lady of the place.  Their marriage was celebrated at night,
and they were both very handsome and very agreeable.</p>

<p>You must not seek anything above yourself, nor flatter yourself on
its advantages.</p>

weapon of his mother Venus, appearing as an irresistibly adorable
infant, potent over the unwitting, and ultimately of malevolent
intent.</p>

<h3>The Two Lion Cubs.</h3>

</div>

<p>Two Lion Cubs had been raised together in the same forest:  they were
the same age, the same size, the same strength.  One was caught in large
nets, in a Grand Mogul's hunt; the other dwelt in steep mountains.</p>

<p>The one that had been captured was led to court, where he lived in
luxury:  they gave him a Gazelle to eat every day; he slept in a lodge
where care was taken for him to sleep softly.  A white eunuch took care
to comb his great golden mane twice a day.</p>

<p>As he was tamed, even the king often stroked him.  He was sleek,
polite, good-looking, and magnificent, for he wore a gold collar, and
they placed in his ears pendants adorned with pearls and diamonds:  he
despised all the other Lions who were in the neighboring lodges, less
beautiful than his, and who were not in such favor as he.  This
prosperity swelled his vanity; he thought he was a great personage,
since he was treated so honorably.  The court where he shone gave him a
taste for ambition; he imagined he would have been a hero had he lived
in the forest.</p>

<p>One day, as they no longer attached him to his chain, he fled from
the palace, and returned to the country where he had been raised.  At
that time the king of all the lion nation had just died, and the States
had been assembled to choose a successor for him.</p>

<p>Among many suitors, there was one who eclipsed all the others by his
pride and his audacity; it was that other lion cub who had never left
the desert, while his companion had made his fortune at court.  The
solitude had often sharpened his courage by cruel hunger; he was
accustomed to nourish himself only through the greatest perils and by
carnage; he tore both flocks and shepherds.  He was lean, bristling,
hideous:  fire and blood blazed from his eyes; he was light, wiry,
accustomed to climbing and dashing fearlessly against spears and
darts.</p>

<p>The two former companions called for a fight to decide who would
rule.  But an old Lioness, wise and experienced, whose advice the whole
republic respected, was of the opinion that he who had studied politics
at court should first be put on the throne.  Many people murmured,
saying that she wanted a vain and voluptuous personage to be preferred
to a warrior who had learned, through fatigue and peril, to support
great affairs.  However, the authority of the old Lioness prevailed:
the Court Lion was placed on the throne.</p>

<p>At first, he indulged in pleasures; he loved only ostentation; he
used flexibility and cunning to hide his cruelty and his tyranny.  Soon
he was hated, despised, detested.</p>

<p>Then the old Lioness said:  "It's time to dethrone him.  I knew well
that he was unworthy to be king; but I wanted you to have one spoiled by
softness and politics, the better to make you feel afterwards the value
of another who has deserved royalty by his patience and his valor.  Now
is the time to make them fight against each other."</p>

<p>Immediately they were placed in an enclosed field, where the two
champions served as a spectacle for the assembly.  But the spectacle was
not long:  the softened Lion trembled and dared not present himself to
the other:  he fled shamefully and hid himself; the other pursued and
insulted him.</p>

<p>All exclaimed:  "Cut his throat and tear him to pieces."</p>

<p>"No, no," he replied; "when one has a cowardly enemy, it would be
cowardly to fear him.  I want him to live; he doesn't deserve to die.  I
shall know how to reign without bothering to keep him submissive."</p>

<p>Indeed, the vigorous Lion reigned with wisdom and authority; the
other was very happy to court him basely, to obtain from him a few
morsels of flesh, and to pass his life in shameful idleness.</p>

<h3>The Fox Punished for His Curiosity.</h3>

</div>

<p>A fox from the mountains of Aragon, having aged in finesse, wanted to
give his last days to curiosity.  He undertook his plan to go to Castile
to see the famous Escorial, which is the palace of the kings of Spain,
built by Philip II.  When he arrived, he was surprised, for he was
little accustomed to magnificence:  until then he had only seen his
burrow and the chicken coop of a neighboring farmer, where he was
usually rather badly received.</p>

<p>There he saw marble columns, golden gates, diamond bas-reliefs.  He
entered several rooms, the tapestries of which were admirable:  there
were hunts, combats, fables in which the gods played among men; finally,
the story of Don Quixote, where Sancho, mounted on his donkey, was going
to govern the island that the Duke had entrusted to him.  Then he saw
cages in which Lions and Leopards had been kept.</p>

<p>While the Fox was looking at these marvels, two palace dogs murdered
him.  He fared poorly for his curiosity.</p>

<h3>The Cat and the Rabbits.</h3>

</div>

<p>A Cat, acting modest, had entered a warren populated by Rabbits.
Immediately the whole republic, alarmed, thought only of retreating into
its holes.  While the newcomer was on the lookout near a burrow, the
deputies of the rabbit nation, who had seen his terrible claws, appeared
in the narrowest part of the entrance to the burrow, to ask him what he
wanted.  He protested in a soft voice that he only wished to study the
manners of the nation; that as a philosopher, he went to all countries
to learn about the customs of each animal species.</p>

<p>The deputies, simple and credulous, returned to tell their brethren
that this stranger, so venerable by his modest bearing and by his
majestic fur, was a sober, disinterested, pacific philosopher, who only
wanted to seek wisdom from country to country; that he came from many
other places where he had seen great wonders; that it would be a great
pleasure to hear him, and that he was careful not to crunch the Rabbits,
since he believed in metempsychosis like a good brahmin, and ate no food
that had life.</p>

<p>This fine speech touched the assembly.  In vain a crafty old Rabbit,
who was the company's doctor, represented how suspicious this grave
philosopher was to him:  in spite of him, they went to salute the
brahmin, who promptly killed seven or eight of these poor people.  The
others went back to their holes, very frightened and ashamed of their
fault.</p>

<p>Then Dom Mitis<sup id="f12_ref01"><a href="#f12_n01">1</a></sup>
returned to the entrance of the burrow, protesting, in a tone full of
cordiality, that he had only committed this murder in spite of himself,
for his pressing need, that henceforth he would live on other animals
and would make with them an everlasting covenant.  The Rabbits
immediately entered into negotiations with him, without however putting
themselves within reach of his claws.  The hard bargaining amused
him.</p>

<p>However, one of the most agile Rabbits came out from behind the
burrow, and went to warn a neighboring shepherd, who liked to rescue
from snares these Rabbits who fed upon juniper.  The shepherd, irritated
against this Cat, exterminator of such a useful people, ran to the
burrow with a bow and arrows:  he saw the Cat who was attentive only to
his prey, and pierced him with one of his arrows; and the expiring Cat
said these last words:</p>

<p>"When you have deceived once, you can no longer be believed by
anyone; we are hated, feared, detested, and we are finally caught by our
own subtleties."</p>

<h3>The Pigeon Punished for His Worry.</h3>

</div>

<p>Two Pigeons lived together in a loft in profound peace.  They cut the
air with their wings, which seemed motionless by their speed.  They
played by flying close to each other, fleeing and chasing each other in
turn; then they went to look for grain in the farmer's field or in the
neighboring meadows.  Immediately they went to quench their thirst in
the pure wave of a stream which flowed through these flowery meadows.
From there, they returned to see their household in the whitewashed
dovecote full of little holes:  they spent their time there in pleasant
company with their faithful companions.  Their hearts were tender, the
plumage of their necks was changeable, and painted with more colors than
the inconstant Iris.  You could hear the sweet murmur of these happy
Pigeons, and their life was delightful.</p>

<p>One of them, growing disgusted with the pleasures of a peaceful life,
allowed himself to be seduced by a mad ambition, and gave up his mind to
the machinations of politics.  He abandoned his old friend; he left
home, and traveled to the Levant.  He passed over the Mediterranean Sea,
sailing with his wings in the air, like a ship with its sails in the
waves of Tethys.  He arrived at Alexandria; from there he continued on
his way, crossing the lands to Aleppo.</p>

<p>On arriving there, he greeted the other Pigeons of the region, who
served as regular couriers, and he envied their happiness.  Immediately
a rumor spread among them that a stranger to their nation had come, who
had crossed immense distances.  He was placed in the rank of couriers:
every week he carried the letters of a Pasha, attached to his foot, and
he traveled twenty-eight leagues in less than a day.  He was proud to
carry the secrets of the State, and took pity on his former companion,
who lived without glory in the holes of his dovecote.</p>

<p>But one day, as he was carrying the letters of the Pasha, who was
suspected of infidelity by the Grand Seignior, he was targeted in order
to discover, through the letters of this Pasha, if he had not some
secret intelligence with the officers of the King of Persia:  an arrow
pierced the poor Pigeon, who with a trailing wing still supported
himself a little, while his blood flowed.  Finally, he fell, the shadows
of death already covering his eyes:  while the letters were taken from
him to read, he expired full of pain, condemning his vain ambition, and
regretting the sweet rest of his dovecote, where he could live safely
with his friend.</p>

<h3>The Two Mice.</h3>

</div>

<p>A Mouse, annoyed at living in peril and alarm, because of Mitis and
Rodilardus,<sup id="f14_ref01"><a href="#f14_n01">1</a></sup> who were
doing great carnage to the Mouse nation, called her neighbor, who was in
a hole nearby.</p>

<p>"A good thought came to me," she told her.  "I have read, in certain
books which I have gnawed these past days, that there is a beautiful
country, called the Indies, where our people are better treated and
safer than here.  In that country, the sages believe that the soul of a
Mouse was once the soul of a great captain, or a king, or a marvelous
fakir, and that it will be able, after the death of the mouse, to enter
the body of some beautiful lady, or of some great holy scholar.<sup
id="f14_ref02"><a href="#f14_n02">2</a></sup> If I remember correctly,
it's called <i>metempsychosis</i>.  In this belief, they treat all
animals with fraternal charity:  we see hospitals of mice, which are
boarded and fed as people of merit.  Come, my sister, let's go to such a
beautiful country, where the police are benevolent, and where we do
justice to our merits."</p>

<p>The neighbor replied:  "But, my sister, don't cats enter these
hospitals?  If that were so, they would cause many metempsychoses in a
short time:  a bite or a claw would make a king or a fakir, a marvel
which we could very well do without."</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid of that," said the first; "order is perfect in that
country:  the cats have their homes, as we have ours, and they also have
their hospitals for invalids, which are separate."</p>

<p>After this conversation, our two Mice leave together; they embark in
a vessel which was about to make a long voyage, slipping along the ropes
the evening before departure.  The ship leaves; and the Mice are
delighted to be at sea, far from the cursed lands where the Cats
exercise their tyranny.  The voyage was successful; they arrived to
Surat, not to amass wealth, like the merchants, but to be treated well
by the Hindus.</p>

<p>Hardly had they entered a house intended for Mice, than they claimed
the first places there.  One claimed to remember having once been a
famous brahmin on the Malabar coast; the other insisted that she had
been a beautiful, long-eared lady from the same country.  They were so
insolent that the Indian Mice could not bear them.  A civil war ensued.
They gave no quarter to these two Franks,<sup id="f14_ref03"><a
href="#f14_n03">3</a></sup> who wanted to lay down the law to others;
instead of being eaten by the Cats, they were killed by their own
sisters.</p>

<p>We may go far to avoid danger, if we are not modest and sensible,
only to seek our misfortune elsewhere:  it would be better to find it at
home.</p>

<h3>The Brave Hare.</h3>

</div>

<p>A Hare, who was ashamed of being a coward, was looking for some
opportunity to harden himself.  He sometimes went through a hole in a
hedge in the cabbages of a peasant's garden, to accustom himself to the
noise of the village.  Often, he even passed fairly close to a few
mastiffs, who contented themselves with barking at him.</p>

<p>On his return from these great expeditions, he thought himself more
formidable than Alcides after all his labors.  It is even said that he
returned to his lodgings only with laurel leaves, and received an
ovation.  He boasted of his prowess to his friends the neighboring
Hares.  He represented the dangers he had run, the alarms he had given
to the enemies, the ruses of war he had made as an experienced captain,
and above all his heroic intrepidity.  Every morning he thanked Mars and
Bellona for having given him the talents and the courage to tame all the
long-eared nations.</p>

<p>John Rabbit,<sup id="f15_ref01"><a href="#f15_n01">1</a></sup>
conversing with him one day, said to him in a mocking tone:  "My friend,
I would like to see you with this beautiful pride in the middle of a
pack of hounds.  Hercules would flee very quickly, and put on an ugly
countenance."</p>

<p>"Me," replied our valiant knight, "I wouldn't back down if all the
bitches around came to attack me."</p>

<p>Scarcely had he spoken than he heard a little turnspit dog from a
neighboring farmer yelping in the bushes some distance from him.
Immediately he trembled, shivered, had a fever, and his eyes were
troubled, like those of Paris when he saw Menelaus rushing furiously at
him.  He sprang from a steep rock into a deep valley, where he nearly
drowned in a stream.</p>

<p>John Rabbit, seeing him make the leap, exclaimed from his burrow:
"There he is, this thunderbolt of war!  There he is, this Hercules who
must purge the earth of all the monsters it is full of!"</p>

<h3>Story of an Old Queen and a Young Peasant.</h3>

</div>

<p>Once upon a time there was a Queen so old, so old, that she had
neither teeth nor hair; her head was shaking like leaves stirred by the
wind; she couldn't see even with her glasses on; the tip of her nose
touched her chin; she was reduced by half, and all in a ball, with her
back so bent, that one would have thought she had always been
misshapen.</p>

<p>A Fairy, who had been present at her birth, approached her and said:
"Would you like to return to your youth?"</p>

<p>"Willingly," answered the Queen:  "I would give all my jewels to be
only twenty years old."</p>

<p>"You must therefore," continued the Fairy, "give your old age to some
other whose youth and health you will take.  To whom shall we give your
hundred years?"</p>

<p>The Queen sent everywhere for someone who wanted to be old to make
her younger.  There came many beggars who wanted to grow old to be rich;
but once they had seen the Queen coughing, spitting, rattling, living on
mush, being dirty, hideous, stinking, suffering, and rambling a little,
they no longer wanted to burden themselves with her years:  they
preferred to beg and wear rags.</p>

<p>The ambitious also came, to whom she promised great ranks and honors.
"But what to do with these ranks?" they would say after seeing her, "we
wouldn't dare show ourselves to be so disgusting and horrible."</p>

<p>But at last, a young village girl presented herself, beautiful as the
day, who asked for the crown as the price of her youth; her name was
P&eacute;ronnelle.<sup id="f16_ref01"><a href="#f16_n01">1</a></sup> The
Queen was angry at first; but what to do? what's the point of getting
angry? she wanted to look younger.</p>

<p>"Let us share," she said to P&eacute;ronnelle, "my kingdom; you will
have half and I the other:  that is quite enough for you who are a
little peasant girl."</p>

<p>"No," answered the girl, "it's not enough for me:  I want everything.
Leave me my poor bonnet<sup id="f16_ref02"><a
href="#f16_n02">2</a></sup> and my rosy complexion; I will leave you
your hundred years with your wrinkles and the death that haunts
you."</p>

<p>"But also," replied the Queen, "what would I do if I had no more
kingdom?"</p>

<p>"You would laugh, you would dance, you would sing like me," said the
girl.</p>

<p>While speaking thus, she began to laugh, to dance and to sing.  The
Queen, who was far from doing the same, said to her:  "What would you do
in my place?  You are not accustomed to old age."</p>

<p>While they were haggling, the Fairy came and said to the Peasant:
"Do you want to do your apprenticeship as an old Queen, to find out if
this trade will suit you?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" said the girl.</p>

<p>Instantly wrinkles covered her forehead; her hair turned white; she
became grumbling and reluctant; her head was shaking and all her teeth
too; she was already a hundred years old.  The fairy opened a little
box, and drew out a crowd of richly dressed officers and courtiers, who
grew as they come out, and paid a thousand respects to the new Queen.
They served her a great feast:  but she was disgusted and unable to
chew; she was ashamed and astonished; she didn't know what to say or
what to do; she would cough till she burst; she would drool on her chin;
she had sticky snot in her nose which she wiped with her sleeve; she
looked at herself in the mirror, and found herself uglier than a
monkey.</p>

<p>However, the real Queen was in a corner, laughing and beginning to
look pretty; her hair was coming back, and her teeth too; she regained a
good, fresh, ruddy complexion; she straightened up in a thousand little
ways:  but she was filthy, short-dressed, and made like a little rag
that had been dragged through the ashes.  She was not accustomed to this
equipage, and the guards, taking her for some kitchen servant, wanted to
drive her out of the palace.</p>

<p>So P&eacute;ronnelle said to her:  "You are very embarrassed at no
longer being Queen, and I even more at being so:  here, here is your
crown, give me back my gray tunic."</p>

<p>The exchange was immediately made; the Queen to grow old again, and
the Peasant Woman to grow younger.  Hardly had the change been made than
both of them repented of it; but it was too late.  The Fairy condemned
them to remain each in her condition.</p>

<p>The Queen cried every day.  As soon as her fingertip hurt, she would
say:  "Alas! if I were P&eacute;ronnelle at this moment, I would be
lodged in a cottage, and I would live on chestnuts; I would dance under
the elm with the shepherds to the sound of the flute.  What use is it to
me to have a beautiful bed, where I only suffer, and so many people who
cannot relieve me?"</p>

<p>This grief increased her ills; the doctors, who were constantly
around her by the dozen, also increased them.  Finally, she died after
two months.</p>

<p>P&eacute;ronnelle was doing a round dance along a clear stream with
her companions when she heard of the death of the Queen:  then she
recognized that she had been more fortunate than wise to have lost the
kingship.  The Fairy came back to see her, and gave her three husbands
to choose from:  one old, chagrined, disagreeable, jealous and cruel,
but rich, powerful, and a very great lord, who could neither day nor
night do without having her with him; the other well built, gentle,
easy-going, amiable and of high birth, but poor and unhappy in
everything; the latter, a peasant like her, who would be neither
beautiful nor ugly, who would love her neither too much nor too little,
who would be neither rich nor poor.  She didn't know which one to take;
for naturally she was very fond of fine clothes, carriages, and high
honors.</p>

<p>But the Fairy said to her:  "Come on, you're a fool.  Do you see this
peasant? this is the husband you need.  You would love the second too
much; you would be too much loved by the first; both would make you
unhappy:  it is quite enough that the third does not beat you.  It is
better to dance on the grass or on the fern than in a palace, and to be
a P&eacute;ronnelle in the village than an unhappy lady in the high
society.  Provided you have no regrets about greatness, you will be
happy with your plowman all your life."</p>

<h3>Story of Queen Gisele and the Fairy Corysante.</h3>

</div>

<p>Once upon a time there was a queen named Gisele, who had a great wit
and a great kingdom.  Her palace was all marble; the roof was silver;
all the furniture, which is elsewhere of iron or copper, was covered
with diamonds.  This Queen was a Fairy; she had only to make wishes, and
immediately everything she wanted was bound to happen.  There was only
one point over which she had no control; she was a hundred years old,
and she couldn't get any younger.  </p>

<p>She had once been more beautiful than day, and had now become so ugly
and so horrible that the very people who came to pay court to her, while
speaking to her, sought pretexts to turn their heads, for fear of
looking at her.  She was all bent over, shaking, lame, wrinkled, filthy,
flushed, coughing and spitting filth all day which made the heart skip a
beat.  She was one-eyed and almost blind; her crooked eyes had a scarlet
border:  finally, she had a gray beard on her chin.  In this state, she
could not look at herself, and had broken all the mirrors in her palace.
She could not tolerate any young person of a reasonable face there.  She
was only served by one-eyed, hunchbacked, lame, and crippled people.</p>

<p>One day a young girl of fifteen, of marvelous beauty, named
Corysante, was presented to the Queen.  At first, she exclaimed:
"Remove this object from my sight!"</p>

<p>But the mother of this young girl said to her:  "Madam, my daughter
is a fairy, and she has the power to give forth all her youth and all
her beauty at this moment."</p>

<p>The Queen averting her gaze replied, "Well! what should I give her
as a reward?"</p>

<p>"All your treasures, and even your crown," replied the mother.</p>

<p>"That's what I'll never get rid of," cried the Queen:  "I'd rather
die."</p>

<p>This offer having been rejected, the Queen fell ill with a disease
which made her so stinking and so foul that her women did not dare
approach her to serve her, and her doctors judged that she would die in
a few days.  In this extremity, she sent for the young girl, and begged
her to take her crown and all her treasures, to give her her youth with
her beauty.  </p>

<p>The girl said to her:  "If I take your crown and your treasures,
giving you my beauty and my age, I will suddenly become old and deformed
like you.  You didn't want to make this deal at first, and I too am
hesitating whether I should do it."</p>

<p>The Queen pressed her very much; and as the inexperienced young girl
was very ambitious, she allowed herself to be touched by the pleasure of
being queen.  The deal was made.</p>

<p>In a moment Gisele sat up, and her figure became majestic; her
complexion took on the most beautiful colors; his eyes looked lively;
the flower of youth spread over her face; she charmed the whole
assembly.  But she had to retire to a village, and live in a hut,
dressed in rags.</p>

<p>Corysante, on the contrary, lost all her charms, and became hideous.
She remained in this superb palace, and ruled as a queen.  As soon as
she saw herself in a mirror, she sighed, and said that nobody was ever
presented before her.  She sought to console herself with her treasures;
but her gold and gems did not prevent her from suffering all the ills of
old age.  She wanted to dance, as she was accustomed to doing with her
companions, in the flowery meadows, in the shade of the groves; but she
could only support herself with a stick.  She wanted to feast; but she
was so languid and disgusted that the most delicious dishes made her
heart ache.  She didn't even have any teeth, and could only eat a little
porridge.  She wanted to hear music concerts; but she was deaf.</p>

<p>Then she regretted her youth and her beauty, which she had foolishly
left for a crown and for treasures which she could not use.  Moreover,
she who had been a shepherdess and who was accustomed to passing the
days singing while leading her sheep, was constantly annoyed with
difficult matters that she could not settle.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Gisele, accustomed to reigning, to possessing all
the greatest possessions, had already forgotten the inconveniences of
old age; she was inconsolable to see herself so poor.  "What!" she said,
"will I always be covered in rags?  What use is all my beauty to me
under this filthy and torn habit?  What use is it to me to be beautiful,
to be seen only in a village by such rude people?  I am despised; I am
reduced to serving and driving animals.  Alas!  I was queen; I am very
unhappy to have left my crown and so many treasures!  Oh! if only I
could have them back!  It is true that I would soon die; well! don't the
other queens die?  Shouldn't we have the courage to suffer and die,
rather than do something base to become young?"</p>

<p>Corysante knew that Gisele regretted her first state, and told her
that as a fairy she could make a second exchange.  Each resumed her
first state.  Gisele became queen again, but old and horrible; Corysante
resumed her charms and her poverty as a shepherdess.</p>

<p>Soon Gisele, overwhelmed with ills, repented of it, and deplored her
blindness; but Corysante, whom she pressed to change again, answered
her:  "I have now experienced the two conditions:  I would rather be
young and eat black bread, and sing every day while tending my sheep,
than to be a queen like you in sorrow and in pain."</p>

<h3>Story of Florise.</h3>

</div>

<p>A peasant woman knew a fairy in her neighborhood.  She begged her to
come to her childbed, where she had a daughter.  The fairy first took
the child in her arms, and said to the mother:  "Choose; she will be, if
you like, beautiful as the day, with a spirit even more charming than
her beauty, and queen of a great kingdom, but unhappy; or else she will
be ugly and a peasant like you, but content in her condition."</p>

<p>The peasant woman chose for this child beauty and wit with a crown,
above all, at the chance of some misfortune.  Presently the little
girl's beauty was already beginning to erase all that was ever seen.
Her mind was gentle, polite, ingratiating; she learned everything anyone
wanted to teach her, and soon knew it better than those who had taught
her.  She danced on the grass, on holidays, with more grace than all her
companions.  Her voice was more touching than any musical instrument,
and she herself made the songs she sang.</p>

<p>At first, she did not know that she was beautiful, but, while playing
with her companions on the edge of a clear fountain, she saw herself;
she noticed how different she was from the others; she admired herself.
The whole country, which flocked to see her, made her charms still more
known to her.  Her mother, who relied on the predictions of the fairy,
looked upon her as a queen, and spoiled her with her kindnesses.  The
young girl wanted neither to spin, nor to sew, nor to keep the sheep;
she amused herself picking flowers, adorning her head with them, singing
and dancing in the shade of the woods.</p>

<p>The king of that country was very powerful, and he had only one son,
named Rosimond, whom he wanted to get married.  He could never bring
himself to hear of any princess from the neighboring states, because a
fairy had assured him that he would find a peasant girl more beautiful
and more perfect than all the princesses in the world.  He resolved to
assemble all the young village girls of his kingdom under eighteen
years, to choose that which would be most worthy to be chosen.</p>

<p>They first excluded an innumerable number of girls who had only
mediocre beauty, and separated thirty who infinitely surpassed all the
others.  Florise (that is the name of the young daughter) had no
difficulty in being included in this number.  These thirty girls were
ranged in the middle of a large hall, in a kind of amphitheater, where
the king and his son could watch them all at once.  Florise appeared, in
the midst of all the others, what a beautiful anemone would appear among
marigolds, or what a flowering orange tree would appear among wild
bushes.  The king exclaimed that she deserved the crown.  Rosimond
thought he was happy to possess Florise.</p>

<p>They took off her village clothes; they gave her some which were all
embroidered with gold.  In an instant, she saw herself covered in pearls
and diamonds.  A large number of ladies were busy serving her.  They
thought only of guessing what might please her, to give it to her before
she had the trouble to ask.  She was lodged in a magnificent apartment
in the palace, which had, instead of tapestries, only large mirrors the
full height of the rooms and closets, so that she might have the
pleasure of seeing her beauty multiplied by all sides, and that the
prince might admire it wherever he looked.  Rosimond had given up
hunting, gambling, all bodily exercises to be constantly near her:  and
as the king her father had died soon after the marriage, it was the wise
Florise, who had become queen, whose advice decided of all affairs of
state.</p>

<p>The queen, mother of the new king, named Gronipote, was jealous of
her daughter-in-law.  She was artful, malignant, cruel.  Old age had
added a hideous deformity to her natural ugliness, and she looked like a
fury.  Florise's beauty made her look even more hideous, and irritated
her at all times:  she could not allow such a beautiful person to
disfigure her.  She also feared her spirit, and abandoned herself to all
the furies of envy.</p>

<p>"You have no heart," she often said to her son, "to have wanted to
marry this little peasant girl, and you have the baseness to make her
your idol:  she is proud as if she had been born in the place where she
is.  When the king your father wanted to marry, he preferred me to any
other, because I was the daughter of a king equal to him.  This is how
you should do it.  Send this little shepherdess back to her village, and
think of some young princess whose birth suits you."</p>

<p>Rosimond resisted his mother; but Gronipote one day took away a note
which Florise was writing to the king, and gave it to a young man of the
court, whom she obliged to take this note to the king, as if Florise had
shown him all the affection she was to have only for the king alone.
Rosimond, blinded by his jealousy and by the malicious advice given to
him by his mother, had Florise locked up for life in a high tower, built
on the point of a rock which rose in the sea.</p>

<p>There she wept night and day, not knowing by what injustice the king,
who had loved her so much, treated her so unworthily.  She was only
allowed to see an old woman to whom Gronipote had entrusted her, and who
insulted her at all times in that prison.  Then Florise remembered her
village, her cabin and all her rural pleasures.</p>

<p>One day, while she was overwhelmed with grief and lamenting the
blindness of her mother, who had preferred her to be beautiful and an
unhappy queen, than an ugly shepherdess and happy in her condition, the
old woman who treated so badly came to tell her that the king was
sending an executioner to cut off her head, and that she had only to
resolve to die.  Florise answered that she was ready to receive the
blow.</p>

<p>Indeed, the executioner, sent by the orders of the king, on the
advice of Gronipote, was holding a large cutlass to execute her, when
there appeared a woman who said that she came on behalf of the old
queen, to say two words in secret to Florise before her death.  The old
woman let her speak to her, because this person seemed to her to be one
of the ladies of the palace; but it was the fairy who had predicted the
misfortunes of Florise at her birth, and who had taken the form of this
lady of the queen mother.  She spoke to Florise in particular, making
everyone withdraw.</p>

<p>"Do you want," she said to her, "to renounce the beauty which has
been so fatal to you?  Do you want to leave the title of queen, resume
your old clothes, and return to your village?"</p>

<p>Florise was delighted to accept this offer.  The fairy applied an
enchanted mask to her face:  immediately her features became coarse, and
lost all their proportions; she became as ugly as she had been beautiful
and pleasant.  In this state, she was no longer recognizable, and she
easily passed through all those who had come there to witness her
ordeal.  She followed the fairy, and went back with her to her
country.</p>

<p>No matter how hard they looked for Florise, they couldn't find her
anywhere in the tower.  The news was brought to the king and to
Gronipote, who searched for her in vain throughout the kingdom.  The
fairy had given her back to her mother, who would not have known her in
such a great change, if she had not been informed of it.</p>

<p>Florise was happy to live ugly, poor and unknown in her village,
where she kept sheep.  Every day she heard others recount her adventures
and deplore her misfortunes.  They had made songs that made everyone
cry; she took pleasure in singing them often with her companions, and
she wept over them like the others:  but she thought herself happy
watching over her flock, and never wanted to tell anyone who she
was.</p>

<h3>Story of a Young Princess.</h3>

</div>

<p>Once upon a time there was a king and a queen who had no children.
They were so angry, so angry, that no one has ever been angrier.
Finally, the queen became pregnant and gave birth to a daughter, the
most beautiful that had ever been seen.  The fairies came when she was
born, but they all told the queen that her daughter's husband would have
eleven mouths, or that if she did not marry before the age of
twenty-two, she would become a toad.</p>

<p>This prediction troubled the queen.  The girl was barely fifteen
years old when a man presented himself who had eleven mouths and was
eighteen feet in height; but the princess found him so hideous that she
never wanted him.  However, the fatal age was approaching, and the king,
who would rather see his daughter married to a monster than become a
toad, resolved to give her to the man with eleven mouths.  The queen
found the alternative unfortunate.  As everyone was getting ready for
the wedding, the queen remembered a certain fairy who had once been one
of her friends:  she summoned her, and asked her if she could not
prevent them.</p>

<p>"I can only do so, madam," replied she, "by changing your daughter
into a linnet<sup id="f19_ref01"><a href="#f19_n01">1</a></sup>.  You
will have her in your room; she will talk every night and always
sing."</p>

<p>The queen consented.  Immediately the princess was covered with fine
feathers and flew to the king; from there she returned to the queen, who
gave her a thousand caresses.  However, the king sent for the princess;
she was not found.  The whole court was in mourning.  The queen
pretended to be distressed like the others; but she still had her
linnet; she conversed with her every night.  One day the king asked her
how she got such a witty linnet; she replied that it was a fairy friend
of hers who had given it to her.</p>

<p>Two months passed sadly.  Finally, the monster, tired of waiting,
told the king that he would eat him with his whole court, if, in a week,
he did not give him the princess; because he was an ogre.  This worried
the queen, who revealed everything to the king.  They sent for the
fairy, who restored the princess to her first form.</p>

<p>However, there came a prince who, besides his natural mouth, had one
at the end of each of his fingers.  The king would have liked to give
him his daughter; but he feared the monster.  The prince, who had fallen
in love with the princess, resolved to fight against the ogre.  The king
consented to this only with great difficulty.</p>

<p>The day was chosen; when it arrived, the champions advanced into the
place of combat.  Everyone made wishes for the prince; but, seeing the
giant so terrible, people trembled with fear for the prince.  The
monster carried an oak club, with which he discharged a blow at Aglaor,
for that was the prince's name; but Aglaor, having avoided the blow, cut
his hamstring with his sword, and, having knocked him down, took his
life.  Everybody cried victory, and Prince Aglaor married the princess
with all the more contentment, as he had delivered her from a rival as
terrible as he was inconvenient.</p>

<h3>Journey to the Island of Pleasures.</h3>

</div>

<p>After sailing for a long time on the Pacific Ocean, we saw in the
distance a sugar island with mountains of compote, rocks of candy sugar
and caramel, and rivers of syrup flowing in the countryside.  The
inhabitants, who were very fond of life there, licked their way along
all the paths and sucked their fingers after dipping them in the rivers.
There were also forests of licorice and tall trees from which waffles
fell, which the wind carried into the travelers' mouths, however
slightly they were opened.</p>

<p>As so many sweets seemed insipid to us, we wanted to go to some other
country where we could find dishes of a higher taste.  We were assured
that there was another island ten leagues away where there were mines of
hams, sausages and peppery stews.  We dug them as we dig gold mines in
Peru.  There were also streams of onion sauces.  The walls of the houses
are made of pastry crusts.  It rains furry black wine<sup
id="f20_ref01"><a href="#f20_n01">1</a></sup> there when the weather is
heavy, and on the finest days the morning dew is always white wine
similar to Greek wine or that of Saint-Laurent.<sup id="f20_ref02"><a
href="#f20_n02">2</a></sup></p>

<p>To pass to this island, we put on the port of the one from which we
wanted to leave, twelve men of prodigious size and who had been put to
sleep:  they were blowing so hard and snoring that they filled our sails
with a favorable wind.  No sooner had we arrived on the other island
than we found merchants on the shore selling appetite, for there was
often a lack of it among so many stews.  There were also other people
who sold sleep.  The price was set so much per hour; but there were
sleeps more expensive than others, in proportion to the dreams one
wanted to have.  The most beautiful dreams were very expensive.</p>

<p>I asked for more agreeable ones for my money, and, as I was tired, I
first went to bed.  But scarcely was I in my bed when I heard a great
noise; I was afraid and called for help.  I was told that it was the
earth opening up.  I thought I was lost; but I was reassured that it
opened like this every night, at a certain hour, to vomit forth
prodigious streams of chocolate mousse and iced liqueurs of all types.
I got up hastily to get some, and they were delicious.</p>

<p>Then I went back to bed, and in my sleep, I thought I saw that
everyone was crystal, that men fed on perfumes when they pleased, that
they could not walk without dancing, nor speak without singing, that
they had wings to cleave the air and fins to cross the seas.  But these
men were like flints:  you couldn't touch them without their giving off
sparks.  They ignited like a fuse, and I couldn't help laughing, seeing
how easily they were agitated.  I wanted to ask one of them why he
seemed so animated.  He replied, showing me his fist, that he never got
angry.</p>

<p>Hardly had I woken up when an appetite merchant came, asking me what
I wanted to be hungry for and if I wanted him to sell me stomach relays
to eat all day.  I accepted the condition.  For my money, he gave me
twelve small sachets of taffeta which I put on myself and which were to
serve me as twelve stomachs, to digest easily twelve large meals in one
day.</p>

<p>No sooner had I taken the twelve sachets than I began to starve.  I
spent my day having twelve delicious feasts.  As soon as a meal was
over, hunger took hold of me again, and I didn't give it time to press
me.  But, as I was greedily hungry, it was remarked that I did not eat
properly:  the people of the country are exquisitely delicate and clean.
In the evening, I was tired of having spent the whole day at the table
like a horse at its hay rack.  I made the resolution to do the exact
opposite the next day, and to feed myself only on good smells.</p>

<p>They gave me orange blossom for breakfast.  At dinner, it was
stronger food:  I was served tuberoses and then Spanish leather.  For a
snack I only had daffodils.  In the evening, they gave me large baskets
full of fragrant flowers for supper, and to them were added casseroles
of all sorts of perfumes.  At night, I had indigestion from smelling too
many nourishing odors.  The next day I fasted to relieve myself from the
fatigue of the pleasures of the table.</p>

<p>I was told that there was a very singular town in that country, and
they promised to take me there in a vehicle that was new to me.  They
put me in a small chair of very light wood and all furnished with large
feathers, and they attached to this chair, with silk cords, four large
birds, as big as ostriches, which had wings proportionate to their
bodies.  These birds first took flight.  I led the reins on the side of
the East, which had been marked for me.  I could see the highest
mountains at my feet, and we flew so fast that I almost lost my breath
as I cut through the wave of air.</p>

<p>In an hour we arrived at this famous city.  It was all marble, and
three times the size of Paris.  The whole town was just one house.
There were twenty-four great courtyards, each of which was as large as
the largest palace in the world, and in the middle of these twenty-four
great courtyards was a twenty-fifth which was six times larger than each
of the others.  All the dwellings in this house were equal, for there
was no inequality of condition among the inhabitants of this town.
There were neither servants nor lower class there; everyone served
themselves, no one was served:  there were only wishes, which were
little flighty, fluttering spirits that gave everyone whatever they
desired at the very moment.</p>

<p>On arriving, I received one of these spirits, which attached itself
to me and which left me wanting for nothing; he barely gave me time to
desire.  I even began to be tired of the new desires that this freedom
to content myself constantly aroused in me, and I understood, by
experience, that it was better to do without superfluous things than to
be constantly in new desires, without never to be able to stop at the
quiet enjoyment of any pleasure.</p>

<p>The people of this town were polite, gentle and obliging.  They
received me as if I had been one of them.  As soon as I wanted to talk,
they guessed what I wanted, and did it without waiting for me to explain
myself.  This surprised me, and I saw that they never spoke to each
other; they read everything they thought in each other's eyes, as one
would read in a book; when they wanted to hide their thoughts, they
merely had to close their eyes.</p>

<p>They led me into a room where there was music for the nose.  They
assembled perfumes as we would assemble sounds.  A certain assemblage of
perfumes, some stronger, others softer, created a harmony that tickled
the sense of smell, just as our concerts would flatter the ear with
sounds that are sometimes low-pitched and sometimes high-pitched.</p>

<p>In that country, the women governed the men; they judged the
lawsuits, they taught the sciences and went to war.  Men made up for it,
adjusted themselves to it from morning till night; they spun, they
sewed, they worked at embroidery, and they feared being beaten by their
wives when they have not obeyed them.</p>

<p>It was said that things were different a number of years ago; but the
men, served by wishes, became so cowardly, so lazy, and so ignorant,
that the women were ashamed to allow themselves to be ruled by them.
They came together to repair the evils of the republic.  They built
public schools where people of their sex who had spirit began to study.
They disarmed their husbands, who asked nothing better than never to go
to blows.  They relieved them of all trials to be judged, watched over
public order, established laws, had them observed, and saved the public
spirit, whose non-application&mdash;the levity and softness of
men&mdash;would surely have caused total ruin.</p>

<p>Touched by this spectacle, and tired of so many feasts and
amusements, I concluded that the pleasures of the senses, however
varied, however easy they may be, debase and do not make one happy.  I
therefore left these countries, apparently so delicious, and, on my
return home, I found in a sober life, in moderate work, in pure morals,
in the practice of virtue, happiness and health which the continuity of
good cheer and the variety of pleasures had not been able to procure for
me.</p>

<h3>Supposed Voyage, in 1690.</h3>

</div>

<p>A few years ago, we made a fine trip, of which you will be very glad
to hear the details.  We left Marseilles for Sicily, and we resolved to
go and visit Egypt.  We arrived at Damietta; we passed through Grand
Cairo.</p>

<p>After having visited the banks of the Nile, going up towards the
south, we insensibly undertook to go and see the Red Sea.  We found on
this coast a vessel which was going to certain islands which were
assured to be even more delightful than the Fortunate Islands.
Curiosity to see these marvels made us embark, and we sailed for thirty
days:  finally, we saw the land from afar.  As we approached, we smelled
the perfumes that these islands spread throughout the sea.</p>

<p>When we landed, we recognized that all the trees of these islands
were of an odoriferous wood like the cedar.  They were laden at the same
time with delicious fruits and exquisitely scented flowers.  The earth
itself, which was black, tasted like chocolate, and we made pastilles
out of it.  All the fountains were of iced liquors; there, gooseberry
water; here, orange blossom water; elsewhere, wines of all kinds.  There
were no houses on all those islands, because the air there was never
cold or hot.  There were everywhere under the trees beds of flowers
where one lay softly to sleep; during sleep one always dreamed of new
pleasures; soft vapors issued from the earth, which represented to the
imagination objects even more enchanted than those which one saw while
awake:  thus, one slept less for need than for pleasure.  All the
country birds knew music, and gave concerts among themselves.</p>

<p>The zephyrs only waved the leaves of the trees in order to create a
gentle harmony.  Throughout the country there were many natural
waterfalls:  all these waters, falling on hollow rocks, made a sound of
a melody similar to that of the best musical instruments.  There was no
painter in the whole country; but when one wanted to have the portrait
of a friend, a beautiful landscape, or a painting which represented some
other object, one put water in large basins of gold or silver:  then one
placed this water opposite to the object we wanted to paint.  Soon the
water, congealing, became like mirror glass.  Although there was no need
for buildings, they could still be made, but without difficulty.  There
were mountains whose surface was covered with ever-flowering lawns.  The
underside was of a more solid marble than ours, but so soft and light,
that it could be cut like butter, and transported a hundred times more
easily than cork:  thus, we only had to carve with a chisel, in the
mountains, palaces or temples of the most magnificent architecture; then
two children easily carried the palace to the place where they wanted to
put it.</p>

<p>Men who were a little sober fed only on exquisite odors.  Those who
wanted stronger food ate of this earth put in chocolate pastilles, and
drank of these frozen liquors which flowed from the fountains.  Those
who were beginning to grow old would shut themselves up for eight days
in a deep cave, where they slept all the while with pleasant dreams:
they were not allowed to bring any light into this dark place.  At the
end of eight days, they awoke with new vigor; their hair was turning
blond again; their wrinkles were erased; they no longer had beards; all
the graces of the most tender youth returned to them.  In this country,
all men had wit; but they didn't make good use of it.  They brought in
slaves from foreign countries, for the purpose of thinking; for they did
not think it worthy of them ever to take the trouble to think for
themselves.  Everyone wanted to have hired thinkers, just as we have
chair carriers here to save themselves the trouble of walking.</p>

<p>These men, who lived with so much delight and magnificence, were very
dirty:  there was nothing stinky or filthy in all the country except the
filth of their noses, and they had no horror of eating it.  There was
neither politeness nor civility among them.  They liked to be alone;
they looked wild and fierce; they were singing barbaric songs that made
no sense.  If they opened their mouths, it was to say no to everything
they were offered.  Instead of writing as we do, making lines straight,
they made theirs in a semicircle.  But what surprised me more was that
they were dancing with their feet inside; they stuck out their tongues,
they made grimaces that you never see in Europe, or in Asia, or even in
Africa, where there are so many monsters.  They were cold, timid and
ashamed before strangers, bold and hot-tempered against those who were
in their familiarity.</p>

<p>Although the climate is very mild and the sky very constant in this
country, the mood of the men there is inconstant and harsh.  Here is a
remedy used to soften them.  There are certain trees in these islands
which bear a large fruit of a long shape, which hangs from the top of
the branches.  When this fruit is picked, we take away everything that
is good to eat, and that is delicious; there remains a hard bark, which
forms a large hollow, roughly the shape of a lute.  This bark has long,
hard, firm filaments like ropes, which run from one end to the other.
These kinds of strings, as soon as you touch them a little, give back
all the sounds you want.  One has only to pronounce the name of the air
one is asking for, this name, blown on the strings, imprints this air on
them immediately.  By this harmony, one softens a little the fierce and
violent spirits.  But, despite the charms of the music, they always fall
back into their dark and incompatible mood.</p>

<p>We asked carefully if there were not lions, bears, tigers, panthers
in the country; and I understood that there was in these charming
islands nothing more ferocious than men.  We would gladly have passed
our lives in such a happy land; but the unbearable mood of its
inhabitants made us give up so many delights.  To be rid of them, we had
to re-embark and return by the Red Sea to Egypt, whence we returned to
Sicily in a very few days; then we came from Palermo to Marseilles with
a very favorable wind.</p>

<p>I will not tell you here many other marvelous circumstances of the
nature of this country, and the customs of its inhabitants.  If you are
curious about it, it will be easy for me to satisfy your curiosity.</p>

<p>But what will you conclude? that it is not a beautiful sky, a fertile
and smiling earth, which amuses, which flatters the senses, which makes
us good and happy.  Isn't that, on the contrary, what softens us, what
degrades us, what makes us forget that we have a reasonable soul, and
neglect the care and the necessity of overcoming our perverse
inclinations, and by working become virtuous?</p>

<h3>Story of King Alfaroute and Clariphile.</h3>

</div>

<p>There was a king named Alfaroute, who was feared by all his neighbors
and loved by all his subjects.  He was wise, good, just, valiant,
skillful:  he lacked nothing.  A fairy came to him and told him that
great misfortunes would soon befall him if he did not use the ring she
put on his finger.  When he turned the diamond of the ring inside his
hand, he became invisible; and as soon as he turned it outside, he was
visible as before.</p>

<p>This ring was very convenient, and gave him great pleasure.  When he
mistrusted one of his subjects, he would go into that man's closet, with
his diamond turned inside; he heard and he saw all the domestic secrets,
without being seen.  If he feared the designs of some neighboring king
of his kingdom, he went to his most secret councils, where he learned
everything without ever being discovered.  Thus, he easily prevented all
that could be done against him:  he averted several conspiracies formed
against his person, and disconcerted his enemies who wanted to overwhelm
him.  He was however not satisfied with his ring, and he asked the fairy
for a means of transporting himself in a moment from one country to
another, in order to be able to make quicker and more convenient use of
the ring which made him invisible.</p>

<p>The fairy replied with a sigh:  "You are asking too much!  I fear
that this last gift will be harmful to you."  He didn't listen to
anything, and always pressed her to grant it to him.  "Well!" she said
to him, "you must therefore, in spite of me, receive what you will
regret having had!"</p>

<p>Then she rubbed his shoulders with an odoriferous liquor.
Immediately he felt small wings growing on his back.  These little wings
did not appear under his clothes; but whenever he resolved to fly, he
had only to touch them with his hand, and immediately they became so
long that he was in a position to infinitely surpass the rapid flight of
an eagle.  As soon as he no longer wanted to fly, he had only to touch
his wings:  then they grew smaller again, so that they could not be seen
under his clothes.</p>

<p>By this means, the king went everywhere in a few moments:  he knew
everything, and one could not conceive how he guessed so many things;
for he shut himself up and seemed to remain almost the whole day in his
study, without anyone daring to enter it.  As soon as he was there, he
made himself invisible by his ring, spread his wings by touching them,
and traveled through immense countries.  Thereby, he engaged in great
wars, where he won all the victories he wanted; but, as he constantly
saw the secrets of men, he knew them to be so wicked and so secretive
that he no longer dared to trust anyone.</p>

<p>The more powerful and formidable he became, the less he was loved;
and he saw that he was loved by none even to whom he had done the
greatest good.  To console himself, he resolved to go to all the
countries of the world to seek a perfect woman whom he could marry, by
whom he could be loved, and by whom he could make himself happy.  He
looked for her for a long time; and, as he saw everything without being
seen, he knew the most impenetrable secrets.  He went to all the
courtyards:  concealed, he found everywhere women who wanted to be
loved, and who loved themselves too much to love a husband in good
faith.</p>

<p>He passed through all the private houses:  one had a light and
inconstant spirit; the other was artful, the other haughty, the other
bizarre; almost all false, vain and idolatrous of their person.  He
descended to the lowest conditions, and he finally found the daughter of
a poor plowman, beautiful as the day, but simple and ingenuous in her
beauty, which she counted for nothing, and which was indeed her least
quality; for she had a spirit and a virtue which surpassed all the
graces of her person.  All the young people in her neighborhood rushed
to see her; and each young man would have thought to secure the
happiness of his life by marrying her.</p>

<p>King Alfaroute could not see her without being passionate about her.
He asked her father, who was overjoyed to see that his daughter would be
a great queen.  Clariphile (that was her name) passed from her father's
cabin to a rich palace, where a large court received her.  She was not
dazzled by it; she preserved her simplicity, her modesty, her virtue,
and she never forgot whence she had come, when she was at the height of
honors.  The king redoubled his tenderness for her, and finally believed
that he would manage to be happy; he was nearly so already, so much did
he begin to trust in the good heart of the queen.  He made himself
invisible at all times, to observe her and to surprise her; but he
discovered nothing in her that he did not find worthy of admiration.
Yet there was a remnant of jealousy and mistrust which still troubled
him a little in his affection.</p>

<p>The fairy who had predicted the disastrous consequences of his last
gift, often warned him of it, and he was annoyed.  He gave orders that
she should not be allowed to enter the palace any longer, and told the
queen that he forbade her to receive her.  The queen promised, with
great difficulty, to obey, because she was very fond of this good
fairy.</p>

<p>One day the fairy, wishing to instruct the queen on the future,
entered her house in the guise of an officer, and declared to the queen
who she was.  Immediately the queen kissed him tenderly.  The king, who
was then invisible, saw him, and was transported from jealousy to fury.
He drew his sword and pierced the queen with it, who fell dying in his
arms.  At this moment the fairy resumed her true form.  The king
recognized her, and understood the queen's innocence.  So, he wanted to
kill himself.  The fairy stopped the blow, and tried to console him.</p>

<p>The queen, expiring, said to him:  "Although I die by your hand, I
die entirely for you."  </p>

<p>Alfaroute lamented his misfortune in having wanted, in spite of the
fairy, a gift which was so disastrous.  He returned the ring to her and
begged her to take off his wings.  The rest of his days were spent in
bitterness and pain.  He had no other consolation than to go and weep at
Clariphile's tomb.</p>

<h3>Story of Rosimond and Braminte.</h3>

</div>

<p>Once upon a time there was a young man more handsome than day, named
Rosimond, who had as much wit and virtue as his elder brother Braminte,
who was badly made, disagreeable, brutal and wicked.  Their mother, who
had a horror of her eldest son, only had eyes for the youngest.  The
eldest, jealous, invented a horrible calumny to lose his brother:  he
told his father that Rosimond often went to a neighbor, who was his
enemy, to report to him everything that happened at home, and to give
him the means to imprison his father.  The father, very angry, beat his
son cruelly until he was bleeding, then kept him imprisoned for three
days, without food, and finally chased him from his house, threatening
to kill him if he ever returned.</p>

<p>The terrified mother dared not say anything; she only moaned.  The
child went away crying; and, not knowing where to go, crossed a large
wood in the evening:  the night overtook him at the foot of a rock; he
sat down at the entrance of a cave, on a carpet of moss where a clear
stream flowed, and there he fell asleep from weariness.  At daybreak, on
waking, he saw a beautiful woman, mounted on a gray horse, with a
covering of gold embroidery, and who seemed to be going hunting.</p>

<p>"Did you see a deer and dogs pass by?" she asked him.  He answered
no.</p>

<p>Then she added:  "It seems to me that you are distressed, are you
not?" she told him.  "Here is a ring that will make you the happiest and
most powerful of men, provided you never abuse it.  When you turn the
diamond inside, you will become invisible; as soon as you turn it out,
you will reappear.  When you put the ring on your little finger, you
will appear to be the king's son, followed by a whole magnificent court;
when you put it on the fourth finger, you will appear naturally."</p>

<p>Immediately the young man understood that it was a fairy who was
talking to him.  After these words she plunged into the wood.  As for
him, he impatiently went back to his father to try on his ring.  He saw
and heard all he wanted without being discovered.  It was up to him to
take revenge on his brother, without exposing himself to any danger.  He
only showed himself to his mother, kissed her, and told her all about
his marvelous adventure.</p>

<p>Then, putting the enchanted ring on his little finger, he suddenly
appeared like the prince, son of the king, with a hundred fine horses,
and a great number of richly dressed officers.  His father was much
surprised to see the king's son in his little house; he was embarrassed,
not knowing what respect he should pay to him.  Then Rosimond asked him
how many sons he had.</p>

<p>"Two," replied the father.</p>

<p>"I want to see them, have them come presently," Rosimond told him.
"I want to take them both to court to make their fortune."</p>

<p>The shy father replied hesitantly:  "Here is the eldest whom I
present to you."</p>

<p>"Where is the youngest?  I want to see him too," said Rosimond
again.</p>

<p>"He's not here," said the father.  "I had chastised him for a fault,
and he left me."</p>

<p>Then Rosimond said to him:  "It was necessary to instruct him, but
not to drive him away.  Anyway, give me the eldest; let him follow me.
And as for you," he said speaking to the father, "follow two guards who
will lead you to the place that I will indicate for them."</p>

<p>Immediately two guards led the father away; and the fairy of whom we
have spoken encountering him in the forest, struck him with a golden
wand, and led him into a dark and deep cave, where he remained enchanted.
"Stay there," she said, "until your son comes to rescue you."</p>

<p>However, the son went to the court of the king, at a time when the
young prince had embarked to go to war on a distant island. He had been
carried by the winds to unknown shores, where, after a shipwreck, he was
captive among a savage people. Rosimond appeared at court as if he had
been the prince who was believed to be lost, and everyone was weeping.
He says he had returned with the help of some merchants, without whom he
would have perished. He made the public happy. The king seemed so
transported that he could not speak; and he never tired of embracing
this son whom he had believed to be dead. The queen was even more
touched. There were great rejoicings throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p>One day, the man who passed for the prince said to his real brother:
"Braminte, you see that I took you out of your village to make your
fortune; but I know that you are a liar, and that you have, by your
impostures, caused the misfortune of your brother Rosimond: he is hidden
here. I want you to speak to him, that he may reproach you for what you
have done."</p>

<p>Braminte, trembling, threw himself at his feet, and confessed his
fault. "Never mind," said Rosimond, "I want you to speak to your brother
and ask his forgiveness. He will be very generous if he forgives you. He
is in my study, where I will show him to you presently. However, I am
going to an adjoining room, to leave you free with him."</p>

<p>Braminte, out of obedience, entered the study.  Rosimond immediately
changed his ring, passed by this room, and then he entered, by another
back door, with his natural face, into the study, where Braminte was
very ashamed to see him.  He begged his forgiveness, and promised to
repair all his faults.</p>

<p>Rosimond embraced him in tears, forgave him, and said to him:  "I am
in full favor with the prince; it is up to me to put you to death, or to
keep you all your life in a prison; but I want to be as good to you as
you were mean to me."</p>

<p>Braminte, ashamed and confused, answered him submissively, not daring
to raise his eyes or call him his brother.  Then Rosimond pretended to
make a secret trip, to go and marry a princess from a neighboring
kingdom; but under this pretext he went to see his mother, to whom he
related all that he had done at court, and gave her, in need, some
little help of money; for the king let him take whatever he wanted; but
he never took much.</p>

<p>However, there arose a furious war between the king and another
neighboring king, who was unjust and in bad faith.  Rosimond went to the
court of the enemy king, entered, by means of his ring, into all the
secret councils of this prince, remaining always invisible.  He took
advantage of all that he learned of the measures of the enemies:  he
forestalled them and disconcerted them in everything:  he commanded the
army against them; he defeated them entirely in a great battle, and soon
concluded a glorious peace with them, on equitable terms.  The king
thought only of marrying him to a princess heiress of a neighboring
kingdom, and more beautiful than the Graces.</p>

<p>But one day, while Rosimond was hunting in the same forest where he
had once found the fairy, she came to him:  "Take care," she told him in
a severe voice, "not to marry as if you were the prince; you must not
deceive anyone:  it is only fair that the prince you are taken for
returns to succeed his father.  Go and find him on an island where the
winds that I will send to swell the sails of your vessel will carry you
without difficulty.  Hasten to render this service to your master,
against what might flatter your ambition, and think of returning as a
good man in your natural condition.  If you don't, you will be unjust
and unhappy, and I will abandon you to your old misfortunes."</p>

<p>Rosimond readily profited from such sage advice.  Under the pretext
of a secret negotiation in a neighboring state, he embarked on a ship,
and the winds carried him first to the island where the fairy had told
him that the king's real son was.  This prince was a captive among a
savage people, where he was made to keep herds.  Rosimond, invisible,
took him away from the pastures where he was leading his herd; and,
covering him with his own cloak, which was invisible like him, he
delivered him from the hands of those cruel people.  They embarked.
Other winds, obeying the fairy, brought them back; they arrived together
in the king's chamber.</p>

<p>Rosimond presented himself to him, and said to him:  "You believed me
to be your son, I am not:  but I return him to you; look, there he is
himself."</p>

<p>The king, greatly astonished, addressed himself to his son, and said
to him:  "Is it not you, my son, who have conquered my enemies, and who
have gloriously made peace? or is it true that you were shipwrecked,
that you were captive, and that Rosimond delivered you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father," he replied.  "It was he who came to the country where
I was captive.  He took me away; I owe him the freedom and the pleasure
of seeing you again.  It is he, and not me, to whom you owe the
victory."</p>

<p>The king could not believe what he was being told:  but Rosimond,
changing his ring, showed himself to the king in the figure of the
prince; and the terrified king saw, at the same time, two men who both
seemed to him together his same son.  Then he offered, for so many
services, immense sums to Rosimond, who refused them; he only asked the
king for the grace to retain for his brother Braminte an office which he
had at court.  As for himself, he feared the inconstancy of fortune, the
envy of men, and his own fragility:  he wanted to retire to his village
with his mother, where he began to cultivate the land.</p>

<p>The fairy, whom he saw again in the woods, showed him the cave where
his father was, and told him the words he had to utter to deliver him;
he pronounced these words with great joy; he delivered his father, whom
he had long been impatient to deliver, and gave him the means to pass
his old age gently.  Rosimond was thus the benefactor of all his family,
and he had the pleasure of doing good to all those who had wished to do
him harm.  After doing the greatest things for the court, he only wanted
from it the freedom to live far from its corruption.</p>

<p>To crown his wisdom, he feared that his ring would tempt him out of
his solitude, and would reengage him in great affairs:  he returned to
the woods where the fairy had appeared to him so favorably.  He went
every day near the cave where he had had the good fortune to see her
formerly, and it was in the hope of seeing her there again.  Finally,
she presented herself to him there again, and he returned the enchanted
ring to her.</p>

<p>"I return to you," he said to her, "a gift of such great value, but
so dangerous, and of which it is so easy to abuse.  I will only believe
myself safe when I no longer have enough to get out of my solitude with
so many means of satisfying all my passions."</p>

<p>While Rosimond was returning this ring, Braminte, whose wicked nature
was not corrected, abandoned himself to all his passions, and wished to
induce the young prince, who had become king, to treat Rosimond
unworthily.</p>

<p>The fairy said to Rosimond:  "Your brother, always an impostor, wants
to make you suspect to the new king and to ruin you:  he deserves to be
punished, and he must perish.  I'm going to give him this ring that
you're giving me back."</p>

<p>Rosimond wept over his brother's misfortune; then he said to the
fairy:  "How do you intend to punish him with such a marvelous present?
He will abuse it to persecute all good people, and to have unlimited
power."</p>

<p>"The same things," replied the fairy, "are a salutary remedy to some,
and a mortal poison to others; Prosperity is the source of all evil for
the wicked.  When you want to punish a villain, you only have to make
him very powerful, to put him to death soon."</p>

<p>She then went to the palace; she appeared at Braminte in the guise of
an old woman covered in rags; she said to him:  "I took from the hands
of your brother the ring which I had lent him, and with which he
acquired so much glory:  receive it from me, and think well of the use
you will make of it."</p>

<p>Braminte answered with a laugh:  "I will not do as my brother did,
who was foolish enough to seek out the prince, instead of reigning in
his place."</p>

<p>Braminte, with this ring, thought only of discovering the secret of
all families, of committing treasons, murders and infamies, of listening
in on the king's counsels, of stealing the wealth of individuals.  His
invisible crimes astonished everyone.  The king, seeing so many secrets
discovered, did not know what to attribute this inconvenience to; but
Braminte's boundless prosperity and insolence made him suspect that he
had his brother's enchanted ring.  To find out, he made use of a
foreigner from an enemy nation, to whom a large sum was given.  This man
came at night to offer Braminte, on behalf of the enemy king, immense
goods and honors, if he would let him know through spies all he could
learn of his king's secrets.</p>

<p>Braminte promised everything, even went to a place where he was given
a very large sum to begin his reward.  He boasted of having a ring that
made him invisible.  The next day the king sent for him, and immediately
seized him.  The ring was taken from him, and several papers were found
on him which proved his crimes.  Rosimond returned to court to ask for
his brother's pardon, which was refused.  Braminte was put to death; and
the ring was more fatal to him than it had been useful to his
brother.</p>

<p>The king, to console Rosimond for Braminte's punishment, returned the
ring to him, like a treasure of infinite value.  A grieved Rosimond did
not judge the same:  he went back to look for the fairy in the
woods.</p>

<p>"Hold," he said to her, "your ring.  My brother's experience made me
understand what I didn't quite understand at first, when you told me.
Keep this fatal instrument of my brother's loss.  Alas! he would still
be alive; he would not have overwhelmed the old age of my father and my
mother with grief and shame; he would perhaps be wise and happy if he
had never had enough to satisfy his desires.  Oh! how dangerous it is to
be able to do more than other men!  Take back your ring:  woe to those
to whom you give it!  The only grace I ask of you is never to give it to
any of my friends."</p>

<h3>The Ring of Gyges.</h3>

</div>

<p>During the reign of the famous Croesus, there was in Lydia a
well-made, witty, very virtuous young man, named Callimachus, of the
race of the ancient kings, and become so poor, that he was reduced to
becoming a shepherd.  Walking one day on remote mountains, where he
dreamed of his misfortunes while leading his herd, he sat down at the
foot of a tree to relax.  He saw near him a narrow opening in a rock.
Curiosity urged him to enter.  He found a wide and deep cave.  At first,
he saw nothing; at last, his eyes became accustomed to the darkness.  He
saw in the dark the gleam of a golden urn, on which were engraved these
words:  <i>Here you will find the ring of Gyges.  O mortal, whoever you
are, to whom the gods intend such great good, show them that you are not
ungrateful, and never envy the happiness of any other man!</i></p>

<p>Callimachus opened the urn, found the ring, took it, and, in the
transport of his joy, left the urn, although he was very poor, and it
was of great price.  He came out of the cave, and hastened to experience
the enchanted ring, of which he had heard so often since his childhood.
He saw King Croesus from afar, who was passing on his way from Sardis to
a delightful house on the banks of the Pactolus.  First, he approached
some slaves who were walking in front and who were carrying perfumes to
spread on the roads where the king was to pass.  He mingled among them
after having turned his ring inside, and no one saw him.  He made noise
on purpose while walking; he even said a few words.  All listened; all
were surprised to hear a voice and see no one.  They said to each other:
"Is this a dream or a truth?  Didn't you think you heard someone
speak?"</p>

<p>Callimachus, delighted to have had this experience, left the slaves
and approached the king.  He was already close to him without being
discovered; he rode with him in his chariot, which was all silver,
adorned with a marvelous sculpture.  The queen was with him, and they
talked together about the greatest secrets of the State, which Croesus
confided only to the queen alone.  Callimachus heard them all the
way.</p>

<p>They arrived at the house, all the walls of which were of jasper; the
roof was of fine copper, shining like gold; the beds were of silver, and
all the rest of the furniture the same:  everything was adorned with
diamonds and precious stones.  The whole palace was constantly filled
with the sweetest perfumes; and, to make them more agreeable, new ones
were spread every hour of the day.  Everything that served the person of
the king was gold.</p>

<p>When he walked in his gardens, the gardeners had the art of growing
the most beautiful flowers under his feet.  Often, they changed, to give
him a pleasant surprise, the decoration of the gardens, as we would
change the decoration of a stage.  Trees with their roots were quickly
transported by large machines, and others were brought in whole; so that
each morning the king, on rising, perceived his gardens entirely
renewed.</p>

<p>One day it was pomegranate trees, olive trees, myrtles, orange trees
and a forest of lemon trees.  Another day suddenly appeared a sandy
desert with wild pines, tall oaks, old firs that seemed as old as the
earth.  Another day, one saw lawns in bloom, meadows of fine, budding
grass, all enameled with violets, through which little streams flowed
impetuously.  On their banks were plants of young willows of tender
verdure, tall poplars which rose to the clouds; bushy elms and fragrant
limes, planted without order, made a pleasing irregularity.  Then
suddenly, the next day, all these little channels disappeared; all that
was visible was a river channel, with pure, transparent water.</p>

<p>This river was the Pactolus, whose waters flowed over golden sand.
One saw on this river vessels with rowers dressed in the richest stuffs
covered with gold embroidery.  The rowers' benches were of ivory; the
oars, of ebony; the beak of the prows, of silver; all the ropes, of
silk; the veils, of purple; and the body of the vessels, of fragrant
woods like cedar.  All the ropes were adorned with festoons; all the
sailors were crowned with flowers.  There sometimes flowed, in the place
of the gardens which were under the windows of Croesus, a stream of
essences whose exquisite odor was exhaled in all the palace.</p>

<p>Croesus had lions, tigers, and leopards, with their teeth and claws
filed down, which were harnessed to little tortoiseshell chariots
trimmed with silver.  These ferocious beasts were guided by bits of gold
and reins of silk.  They were used by the king and the whole court to
promenade in the vast roads of a forest, which preserved under its
impenetrable branches an eternal night.  Often, they also raced with
these chariots along the river, in a plain meadow like a green carpet.
These proud animals ran so lightly and with such rapidity that they did
not even leave on the soft grass the slightest trace of their steps, nor
of the wheels they dragged after them.  Every day new species of races
were invented to exercise the vigor and skill of young people.  Croesus,
at each new game, awarded some great prize to the winner.  So, the days
flowed by in delights and among the most agreeable spectacles.</p>

<p>Callimachus resolved to surprise all the Lydians by means of his
ring.  Several young men of the highest birth had run before the king,
who had alighted from his chariot in the meadow to watch them run.  When
the suitors had finished their race, and Croesus was considering who the
prize should belong to, Callimachus got into the king's chariot.  He
remained invisible; he pushed the lions, the chariot flew.  One would
have thought it was that of Achilles dragged by immortal steeds, or that
of Phoebus himself, when, after having traversed the immense vault of
the heavens, he hurls his fiery horses into the bosom of the waves.  At
first it was thought that the lions, having escaped, fled at random; but
soon it was recognized that they were guided with great art, and that
this race would surpass all the others.  However, the chariot appeared
empty, and everyone stood motionless with astonishment.</p>

<p>Finally, the race was over, and the prize won, without anyone being
able to understand by whom.  Some believed that it was a divinity who
played with men; the others assured that it was a man named Orodes, who
came from Persia, who had the art of enchantments, who evoked the
shadows of hell, who held in his hands all the power of Hecate, who sent
Discord at will, and the Furies in the soul of his foes, which uttered
at night, the howls of Cerberus and the deep moans of Erebus; finally
who could eclipse the moon and bring it down from heaven to earth.</p>

<p>Croesus believed that Orodes had led the chariot; he sent for him.
He was found holding twisted serpents in his bosom, and pronouncing
unknown and mysterious words between his teeth, conjuring up the
infernal divinities.  They tried to convince him that he was the
invisible winner of this race.  He said no; but the king could not
believe it.</p>

<p>Callimachus was an enemy of Orodes, because the latter had predicted
to Croesus that this young man would one day cause him great
embarrassment and would be the cause of the entire ruin of his kingdom.
This prediction had forced Croesus to keep Callimachus away from the
world in a desert, and reduce him to great poverty.  Callimachus felt
the pleasure of revenge, and was glad to see his enemy's embarrassment.
Croesus pressed Orodes, and couldn't get him to say he ran for the
prize.  But as the king threatened to punish him, his friends advised
him to confess the matter and to take pride in it.</p>

<p>So, he passed from one extremity to the other; vanity blinded him.
He boasted of having made this marvelous blow by virtue of his
enchantments.  But, at the moment when they were talking to him, they
were very surprised to see the same chariot start the same race again.
Then the king heard a voice whisper in his ear:  "Orodes is laughing at
you; he brags about what he hasn't done."  The king, irritated against
Orodes, immediately had him put in irons and thrown into a deep
prison.</p>

<p>Callimachus, having felt the pleasure of satisfying his passions by
the aid of his ring, gradually lost the feelings of moderation and
virtue which he had had in his solitude and in his misfortunes.  He was
even tempted to enter the king's chamber and kill him in his bed.  But
one does not pass all of a sudden to the greatest crimes; he had a
horror of so black an action, and could not harden his heart to carry it
out.  But he set out to go to Persia to find Cyrus:  he told him the
secrets of Croesus which he had heard and the secret of the Lydians to
make a league against the Persians with the Greek colonies of all the
coasts of Asia Minor; at the same time, he explained to him the
preparations of Croesus and the means of preventing him.</p>

<p>Immediately Cyrus set out from above the banks of the Tigris, where
he was encamped with an innumerable army, and came as far as the river
Halys, where Croesus presented himself to him with troops more
magnificent than courageous.  The Lydians lived too sensuously not to
fear death.  Their clothes were embroidered with gold and similar to
those of the vainest women; their arms were all gilded; they were
followed by a prodigious number of superb chariots; gold, silver, and
precious stones shone everywhere in their tents, in their vases, in
their furniture, and even on their slaves.</p>

<p>The ostentation and softness of this army could only lead to
imprudence and cowardice, although the Lydians were much more numerous
than the Persians.  These, on the contrary, showed only poverty and
courage; they were scantily clad; they lived on little, fed on roots and
vegetables, drank only water, slept on the ground, exposed to the abuses
of the air, constantly exercised their bodies to harden them at work;
they had no other ornament than iron; their troops were all bristling
with pikes, darts, and swords; so, they had only contempt for enemies
drowned in delights.</p>

<p>The battle barely deserved the name of a fight.  The Lydians could
not withstand the first shock:  they fell over each other; the Persians
only killed; they swam in blood.  Croesus fled to Sardis.  Cyrus pursued
him there without wasting a moment.  Here he was besieged in his capital
city.  He succumbed after a long siege; he was taken; they lead him to
execution.  In this extremity, he pronounced the name of Solon.  Cyrus
wanted to know what he was saying.  He learned that Croesus deplored his
misfortune for not having believed this Greek, who had given him such
wise advice.  Cyrus, touched by these words, granted life to
Croesus.</p>

<p>Then Callimachus began to grow disgusted with his fortune.  Cyrus had
placed him in the rank of his satraps, and had given him great wealth.
Another would have been pleased; but the Lydian, with his ring, felt
able to climb higher.  He could not bear to see himself confined to a
condition where he had so many equals and a master.  He couldn't bring
himself to kill Cyrus, who had done him so much good.  He even sometimes
regretted having overthrown Croesus from his throne.  When he had seen
him led to execution, he had been seized with grief.  He could no longer
remain in a country where he had caused so much evil, and where he could
not satiate his ambition.</p>

<p>He left, and sought an unknown country; he crossed immense lands,
everywhere experienced the magic and marvelous effect of his ring,
raised at will and overthrew kings and kingdoms, amassed great wealth,
reached the height of honors, and yet found himself always devoured by
desires.  His talisman gave him everything except peace and
happiness.</p>

<p>Thus, it is that we find them only in ourselves; that they are
independent of all those external advantages to which we set so much
store, and that when in opulence and grandeur one loses simplicity,
innocence and moderation, then the heart and the true seats of happiness
fall prey to trouble, anxiety, shame and remorse.</p>

<h3>Story of Alibeus the Persian.</h3>

</div>

<p>Shah-Abbas, king of Persia, making a journey, departed from all his
court, to pass through the countryside without being known there, and to
see the people there in all their natural freedom.  He only took with
him one of his courtiers.</p>

<p>"I do not know," said the king to him, "the true morals of men;
everything that approaches us is disguised; it is art and not simple
nature that shows itself to us.  I want to study rustic life, and see
this kind of men who are so despised, although they are the true support
of all human society.  I am tired of seeing courtiers watching me to
surprise me by flattering me; I have to go and see laborers and
shepherds who don't know me."</p>

<p>He passed with his confidant through several villages where dances
were taking place, and he was delighted to find tranquil and inexpensive
pleasures far from the courts.  He had a meal in a cabin; and as he was
very hungry, after having walked more than usual, the coarse food he
took there seemed to him more agreeable than all the exquisite dishes on
his table.  As he passed through a meadow strewn with flowers, which
bordered a clear stream, he saw a young shepherd playing the flute in
the shade of a large elm, near his grazing sheep.</p>

<p>He approached him, examined him, and found in him a pleasant
countenance, a simple and ingenuous air, but noble and graceful.  The
rags with which the shepherd was covered did not diminish the brilliance
of his beauty.  The king at first thought it was some person of
illustrious birth who had disguised himself; but he learned from the
shepherd that his father and mother were in a neighboring village, and
that his name was Alibeus.</p>

<p>As the king questioned him, he admired in him a firm and reasonable
spirit.  His eyes were lively and had nothing fiery or fierce about
them; his voice was soft, insinuating and touching; there was nothing
rude about his face; but he was not a soft, effeminate beauty.  The
shepherd, about sixteen years old, did not know that he was as he
appeared to others; he thought that he thought, spoke, was made like all
the other shepherds in his village; but, while uneducated, he had
learned all that reason teaches those who listen to it.</p>

<p>The king, having spoken to him familiarly, was charmed by him; he
learned from him about the state of the people all that kings never
learn from a crowd of flatterers who surround them.  From time to time,
he laughed at the naivety of this child, who spared nothing in his
answers.  It was a great novelty for the king to hear people speak so
naturally; he made a sign to the courtier who accompanied him not to
discover that he was the king; for he feared that Alibeus would lose all
his freedom and all his graces in a moment, if he happened to know to
whom he was speaking.</p>

<p>"I see," said the prince to the courtier, "that nature is no less
beautiful in the lowest conditions than in the highest.  Never did a
king's child seem better born than this one, who tends the sheep.  I
would be only too happy to have a son so handsome, so sensible, so
lovable.  He seems to me suitable for everything, and if care is taken
to educate him, he will certainly one day be a great man:  I want him to
be educated near me."</p>

<p>The king took Alibeus away, who was very surprised to learn whom he
had made himself agreeable to.  They made him learn to read, write,
sing, and then they gave him masters for the arts and for the sciences
which adorn the mind.  At first, he was a little dazzled by the court;
and his great change of fortune changed his heart a little.  His age and
his favor taken together somewhat altered his wisdom and moderation.
Instead of his crook, his flute, and his shepherd's habit, he took a
purple robe, embroidered with gold, with a turban covered with jewels.
His beauty effaced all that was most agreeable about the court.  He made
himself capable of the most serious affairs, and deserved the confidence
of his master, who, knowing Alibeus's exquisite taste for all the
magnificence of a palace, finally gave him a very considerable office in
Persia, which is that of keep all the precious stones and furniture that
the prince has.</p>

<p>Throughout the life of the great Shah-Abbas, Alibeus's favor only
increased.  As he advanced into a more mature age, he finally remembered
his former condition, and he often regretted it.  "O beautiful days," he
said to himself, "innocent days, days when I tasted a pure and without
danger joy, days since which I have seen none so sweet, will I never see
you again? he who deprived me of you, by giving me so much wealth, took
everything away from me."</p>

<p>He wanted to go and see his village again; he softened at the sight
of all the places where he had formerly danced, sung, played the flute
with his companions.  He did some good to all his relatives and all his
friends; but he wished them for their principal happiness never to quit
country life, and never to experience the misfortunes of the court.</p>

<p>He experienced them, these misfortunes.  After the death of his good
master Shah-Abbas, his son Shah-Sephi succeeded this prince.  Envious
courtiers full of artifices found a way to warn him against Alibeus.  He
abused, they said, the confidence of the late king; he amassed immense
treasures, and embezzled several things of very great value, of which he
was the depositary.  Shah-Sephi was altogether young and princely; it
didn't take much to be credulous, inattentive, and careless.  He had the
vanity to want to appear to reform what the king his father had done,
and to judge better than he.  To have a pretext to dispossess Alibeus of
his office, he asked him, according to the advice of these envious
courtiers, to bring him a scimitar garnished with diamonds of immense
price which the king his grandfather had used to carry in battles.</p>

<p>Shah-Abbas had formerly removed from this scimitar all these
beautiful diamonds; and Alibeus proved by good witnesses that the thing
had been done by order of the late king, before the office had been
given to Alibeus.  When Alibeus's enemies saw that they could no longer
use this pretext to ruin him, they advised Shah-Sephi to order him to
make, within a fortnight, an exact inventory of all the precious
furniture with which he was responsible.  At the end of fifteen days, he
asked to see everything himself.</p>

<p>Alibeus opened all the doors for him, showed him everything he had on
guard.  Nothing was missing; everything was clean, tidy, and kept with
great care.  The king, greatly disappointed to find everywhere so much
order and punctuality, had almost returned in favor of Alibeus, when he
perceived, at the end of a large gallery, full of very sumptuous
furniture, an iron door which had three large locks.</p>

<p>"It was there," the jealous courtiers whispered in his ear, "that
Alibeus hid all the precious things he stole from you."</p>

<p>Immediately the angry king cried out:  "I want to see what is beyond
this gate.  What did you put there? show it to me."</p>

<p>At these words Alibeus threw herself on his knees, conjuring him in
the name of God not to take from him what was most precious on earth.
"It is not right," he said, "for me to lose in a moment what remains to
me, and which constitutes my resource, after having worked so many years
with your father the king.  Take away, if you want, all the rest; but
leave this to me."</p>

<p>The king had no doubt that it was ill-gotten treasure, which Alibeus
had amassed.  He took a higher tone, and absolutely wanted the door to
be opened.  Finally, Alibeus, who had the keys, opened it himself.
Nothing was found in this place except the crook, the flute, and the
shepherd's habit which Alibeus had formerly worn, and which he often saw
again with joy, for fear of forgetting his first condition.</p>

<p>"Here," he said, "O great king, are the precious remnants of my
former happiness:  neither fortune nor your power have been able to take
them away from me.  Here is my treasure, which I keep to enrich myself,
when you have made me poor.  Take over everything else; leave me these
dear pledges of my first estate.  Here they are, my true goods which I
will never miss.  Here they are, these simple, innocent goods, always
sweet to those who know how to be satisfied with the necessary and do
not torment themselves for the superfluous.  There they are, those goods
of which liberty and security are the fruits.  There they are, those
possessions that have never given me a moment of embarrassment.  O dear
instruments of a simple and happy life!  I only love you; it is with you
that I want to live and die.  Why must other deceitful goods have come
to deceive me, and disturb the rest of my life?  I return them to you,
great king, all these riches which come to me from your liberality:  I
only keep what I had when the king, your father, came, by his graces, to
make me unhappy."</p>

<p>The king, hearing these words, understood Alibeus's innocence; and,
being indignant at the courtiers who had wanted to destroy him, he drove
them from his side.  Alibeus became his principal officer, and was
charged with the most secret affairs; but he saw his crook, his flute,
and his old clothes every day, which he always kept ready in his
treasury, to resume them as soon as inconstant fortune disturbed his
favor.  He died in extreme old age, without ever wanting to have his
enemies punished, nor amass any wealth, and leaving his parents only
enough to live in the condition of shepherds, which he always believed
to be the safest and happiest.</p>

<h3>The Bees and the Silkworms.</h3>

</div>

<p>One day the Bees ascended to Olympus, at the foot of the throne of
Jupiter, to beg him to have regard to the care they had taken of his
childhood, when they nourished him with their honey on Mount Ida.
Jupiter wanted to grant them the first honors among all the little
animals; but Minerva, who presides over the arts, represented to him
that there was another species which disputed with the bees the glory of
useful inventions.  Jupiter wanted to know its name.  "It's the
silkworms," she replied.  Immediately the father of the gods ordered
Mercury to bring on the wings of the twelve zephyrs deputies of this
little people, so that the reasons of the two parties could be
heard.</p>

<p>The Bee, ambassador of her nation, represented the sweetness of
honey, which is the nectar of men, its usefulness, the artifice with
which it is composed; then she extolled the wisdom of the laws which
police the flying republic of the Bees.  "No other species of animals,"
said the orator, "has this glory, and it is a reward for having
nourished the father of the gods in a cave.  Moreover, we share the
warrior value, when our king animates our troops in the fights.  How
dare these Worms, vile and despicable insects, challenge us for the
first place?  They only know how to crawl, while we take a noble flight,
and with our golden wings we ascend to the stars."</p>

<p>The haranguer of the Silkworms answered:  "We are but little worms,
and we have neither this great courage for war, nor these wise laws; but
each of us shows the marvels of nature, and consumes himself in useful
work.  Without laws, we live in peace, and we never see civil wars among
us, while the Bees kill each other with each change of king.  We have
the virtue of Proteus to change form:  sometimes we are little worms
composed of eleven little rings, intertwined with the variety of the
most vivid colors that one admires in the flowers of a bed.  Then we
spin with what to dress the most magnificent men even on the throne, and
what to adorn the temples of the gods.  This adornment, so beautiful and
so durable, is well worth honey, which soon spoils.  Finally, we are
transformed into a bean, but one which smells, moves and always shows
life.  After these prodigies, we suddenly become butterflies with the
brilliance of the richest colors.  It is then that we no longer yield to
the Bees, and rise with a bold flight to Olympus.  Judge now, O father
of the gods."</p>

<p>Jupiter, embarrassed for the decision, finally declared that the Bees
would hold the first rank, because of the rights they had acquired since
ancient times.  "By what means," he said, "could I degrade them?  I owe
them too much; but I do believe that men owe even more to the
Silkworms."</p>

<h3>The Nile and the Ganges.</h3>

</div>

<p>One day two rivers, jealous of each other, presented themselves to
Neptune, to dispute the first rank.  The god was on his golden throne,
in the middle of a deep cave.  The vault was of pumice stones, mixed
with rockwork and sea shells.  The immense waters came from all sides,
suspended in a vault above the head of the god.  There appeared old
Nereus, wrinkled and bent like Saturn, the great Ocean, father of so
many Nereids; Tethys, full of charms; Amphitrite with the small
Palaemon; Ino and Melicertes, and a crowd of young Nereids crowned with
flowers.  Proteus himself had rushed there with his marine herds, who
with their vast open nostrils swallowed the bitter wave to snort it
forth like rapid rivers which fall from the steep rocks.  All the little
transparent fountains, the leaping and foaming streams, the rivers which
water the earth, the seas which surround it, came to bring the tribute
of their waters into the motionless bosom of the sovereign father of the
waves.</p>

<p>The two rivers, one of which was the Nile and the other the Ganges,
advanced.  The Nile held a palm in his hand, and the Ganges, that Indian
reed whose marrow yields a juice so sweet that one calls sugar.  They
were crowned with rushes.  The old age of both was equally majestic and
venerable.  Their nervous bodies were of a vigor and a nobility above
man.  Their beards, of a bluish green, floated down to their belts;
their eyes were bright and sparkling, despite such a damp stay.  Their
thick, wet eyebrows fell over their eyelids.  They went through the
crowd of sea monsters; the herds of playful Tritons sounded their coiled
conch trumpets; the dolphins rose above the wave, which they caused to
bubble by the movements of their tails, and then plunged into the water
with a terrible noise, as if the abysses had opened.</p>

<p>The Nile was the first to speak thus:  "O great son of Saturn, who
holds the vast empire of the waters, sympathize with my pain; they
unjustly deprive me of the glory which I have enjoyed for so many
centuries:  a new river, which flows only in barbarous countries, dares
to dispute with me the first rank.  Have you forgotten that the land of
Egypt, fertilized by my waters, was the asylum of the gods, when the
giants wanted to scale Olympus?</p>

<p>"It is I who give this land its price:  it is I who make Egypt so
delightful and so powerful.  My course is immense:  I come from those
burning climates which mortals dare not approach; and when Phaethon, on
the chariot of the Sun, set the land ablaze, to prevent him from drying
up my waters, I hid my superb head so well that no one has yet been
able, since that time, to discover where is my source and my origin.</p>

<p>"Instead of the disordered overflows of other rivers ravaging the
countryside, mine, always regular, spread abundance in these happy lands
of Egypt, which are rather a beautiful garden than a countryside.  My
docile waters are divided into as many channels as the inhabitants like,
to water their lands and to facilitate their commerce.  All my shores
are full of cities, and there are as many as twenty thousand of them in
Egypt alone.  You know that my catadupes, or cataracts, make a marvelous
fall of all my waters from certain rocks below, above the plains of
Egypt.  It is even said that the noise of my waters, in this fall, makes
all the inhabitants of the country deaf.</p>

<p>"Seven different mouths bring my waters into your empire, and the
Delta they form is the abode of the wisest, most learned, best-policed,
and oldest people in the universe:  it counts many thousands of years in
its history and in the tradition of its priests.  I have therefore for
me the length of my course, the antiquity of my peoples, the marvels of
the gods accomplished on my shores, the fertility of the lands by my
floods, the singularity of my unknown origin.</p>

<p>"But why tell all my advantages against an opponent who has so few?
It issues from the wild and icy lands of the Scythians, throws itself
into a sea which has no commerce except with barbarians; these countries
are famous only for having been subjugated by Bacchus followed by a
troop of drunken and disheveled women, dancing with thyrses in their
hands.  It has on its shores neither polite and learned peoples, nor
magnificent cities, nor monuments of the benevolence of the gods:  it is
a newcomer who boasts without proof.  O mighty god, who commands waves
and storms, confuse his temerity!"</p>

<p>"It is yours that must be confounded," replied the Ganges.  "You are,
it is true, known earlier; but you did not exist before me.  Like you, I
descend from high mountains, I traverse vast countries, I receive the
tribute of many rivers, I go by several mouths into the bosom of the
seas, and I fertilize the plains which I flood.  If I wanted, following
your example, to give into the marvelous, I would say, with the Indians,
that I come down from heaven, and that my beneficent waters are no less
salutary to the soul than to the body.</p>

<p>"But it is not before the god of the rivers and the seas that one
should take advantage of these chimerical pretensions.  Created however
when the world came out of chaos, several writers made me born in the
garden of delights which was the abode of the first man.  But what is
certain is that I water even more kingdoms than you; it is because I
travel through such pleasant and fertile lands; it is that I roll with
this gold dust so sought after, and perhaps so fatal to the happiness of
men; it is that one finds on my shores pearls, diamonds, and all that is
used for the ornament of temples and mortals:  it is that one sees on my
shores superb buildings, and that one there celebrates long and
magnificent feasts.</p>

<p>"The Indians, like the Egyptians, also have their antiquities, their
metamorphoses, their fables; but what they have more than they are
illustrious gymnosophists, enlightened philosophers.  Which of your
renowned priests could you compare to the famous Pilpay?<sup
id="f27_ref01"><a href="#f27_n01">1</a></sup> He taught princes the
principles of morality and the art of ruling with justice and kindness.
His ingenious apologues have made his name immortal; we read them, but
we hardly profit from them in the States that I enrich; and what makes
us all ashamed is that we see on our shores only unhappy princes,
because they only love pleasures and an unlimited authority; it is that
we see in the most beautiful countries of the world only miserable
peoples, because they are almost all slaves, almost all victims of the
arbitrary wills and the insatiable greed of the masters who govern them,
or rather who crush them.</p>

<p>"Of what use am I to the antiquity of my origin, and the abundance of
my waters, and all the spectacle of marvels that I offer to the
navigator?  I want neither the honors nor the glory of preference, as
long as I do not contribute more to the happiness of the multitude, as
long as I only serve to maintain the softness or the greed of a few
sumptuous and unapplied tyrants.  There is nothing great, nothing
estimable, except what is useful to the human race."</p>

<p>Neptune and the assembly of the sea gods applauded the speech of the
Ganges, and praised his tender compassion for the vexed and suffering
humanity.  They made him hope that, from another part of the world,
there would come to India civilized and human nations, who could
enlighten the princes on their true happiness, and make them understand
that it consists mainly, as he believed with so much truth, to make
happy all who depend on them, and to govern them with wisdom and
moderation.</p>

<h3>Young Bacchus and the Faun.</h3>

</div>

<p>One day the young Bacchus, whom Silenus was instructing, was looking
for the Muses in a grove whose silence was disturbed only by the sound
of fountains and the song of birds.  The sun could not, with its rays,
pierce the dark greenery.  The child of Semele, to study the language of
the gods, sat down in a corner, at the foot of an old oak, from the
trunk of which several men of the golden age were born.  It had even
delivered oracles in the past, and Time had not dared to strike it down
with his sharp scythe.</p>

<p>Near this sacred and ancient oak hid a young Faun, who listened to
the verses that the child sang, and who pointed out to Silenus, with a
mocking laugh, all the faults his disciple made.  Immediately the Naiads
and the other Wood Nymphs smiled too.  This critic was young, graceful
and playful; his head was crowned with ivy and vines; his temples were
adorned with bunches of grapes; from his left shoulder hung on his right
side, like a scarf, a festoon of ivy:  and the young Bacchus was pleased
to see these leaves consecrated to his divinity.  The Faun was
enveloped, above the belt, by the frightful and bristling remains of a
young lioness which he had killed in the forests.  He held in his hand a
bent and knotted crook.  His tail appeared behind, as if playing on his
back.</p>

<p>But, as Bacchus could not tolerate his malicious laugher, always
ready to make fun of his expressions, whenever they were not pure and
elegant, he said to him in a proud and impatient tone:  "How dare you
make fun of the son of Jupiter?"</p>

<p>The Faun answered without emotion:  "Hey! how dare the son of Jupiter
make a mistake?"</p>

<h2>XXVIX.</h2>

<h3>The Infant of the Muses Favored by the Sun.</h3>

</div>

<p>The Sun, having left the vast circumference of the sky in peace, had
finished his course and plunged his fiery horses into the bosom of the
waves of the West<sup id="f29_ref01"><a href="#f29_n01">1</a></sup>.
The edge of the horizon was still red as crimson, and aflame with the
fiery rays which he had shed there in his path.  The scorching heat wave
parched the earth; all the weathered plants languished; the faded
flowers bowed their heads, and their diseased stems could no longer
support them; even the Zephyrs held back their sweet breaths; the air
the animals breathed was like lukewarm water.  The night, which spread
with its shadows a sweet coolness, could not temper the devouring heat
which the day had caused:  it could not drench the downcast and failing
men, nor the dew which it distills when the Evening Star shines at the
tail of the other stars, nor that harvest of poppies which make all
weary nature feel the charms of sleep.</p>

<p>The Sun alone, in the bosom of Tethys, enjoyed deep repose; but then,
when he was obliged to get back on his chariot harnessed by the Hours
and preceded by Dawn, which sows its way with roses, he saw all Olympus
covered with clouds; he saw the remnants of a storm that had frightened
mortals all night.  The clouds were still plagued with the odor of the
sulfur vapors which had lit the lightning and rumbled the threatening
thunder; the rebellious Winds, having broken their chains and forced
their deep dungeons, still roared in the vast plains of the air;
torrents fell from the mountains in all the valleys.  He whose eye full
of rays animates all nature, saw on all sides, on rising, the remnant of
a cruel storm.</p>

<p>But what moved him more, he saw a young infant of the Muses, who was
very dear to him, and whom the storm had stolen from sleep, when he was
already beginning to spread his dark wings over his eyelids.  He was on
the point of bringing back his horses, and delaying the day, to restore
rest to him who had lost it.  "I want him," he said, "to sleep:  sleep
will refresh his blood, soothe his bile, give him the health and
strength he will need to imitate the labors of Hercules, inspire in him
I know not what tender sweetness that alone could miss him.  Provided he
sleeps, laughs, softens his temper, enjoys social games, takes pleasure
in loving men and making himself loved by them, all the graces of the
mind and the body will come in crowds to adorn it."</p>

<h3>The Nightingale and the Warbler.</h3>

</div>

<p>On the ever-green banks of the river Alpheus, there is a sacred
grove, where three Naiads scatter their clear waters with a loud noise,
and water the budding flowers:  the Graces often go there to bathe.  The
trees of this grove are never agitated by the winds which respect them;
they are only touched by the breath of the gentle Zephyrs.  Nymphs and
Fauns perform dances there at night to the sound of the Panpipes.  The
Sun could not pierce with its rays the thick shadow formed by the
intertwined branches of this grove.  Silence, darkness and delicious
freshness reign there day and night.</p>

<p>Beneath this foliage, one hears Philomela singing in a plaintive and
melodious voice her old misfortunes, for which she is not yet consoled.
A young Warbler, on the contrary, sings of her pleasures there, and she
announces spring to all the shepherds around; even Philomela is jealous
of the tender songs of her companion.  One day, they saw a young
shepherd whom they had never seen before in these woods; he appeared to
them gracious, noble, loving the Muses and harmony:  they believed that
he was Apollo such as he was formerly with King Admetus, or at least
some young hero of the blood of this God.  The two birds, inspired by
the Muses, immediately began to sing thus:</p>

<p class="small">Who is this shepherd or this unknown god who comes to
adorn our grove?  He is sensitive to our songs; he loves poetry:  it
will soften his heart and make him as lovable as he is proud.</p>

<p>So, Philomel continued alone:</p>

<p class="small">May this young hero grow in virtue like a flower that
spring brings to bloom! how he loves the sweet games of the mind, may
the Graces be on his lips! may the wisdom of Minerva reign in her
heart!</p>

<p>The warbler replied:</p>

<p class="small">Let him equal Orpheus in the charms of his voice, and
Hercules in his high deeds!  May he carry in his heart the audacity of
Achilles, without having its ferocity!  May he be good, may he be wise,
beneficent, tender for men, and loved by them!  May the Muses give birth
to all the virtues in him!</p>

<p>Then the two inspired birds resumed together:</p>

<p class="small">He loves our sweet songs; they enter his heart, as the
dew falls on our lawns burned by the sun.  May the gods moderate him and
make him always fortunate! let him hold in his hand the cornucopia! may
the golden age return through him! may wisdom spread from his heart to
all mortals! and that flowers are born under his feet!</p>

<p>As they sang, the Zephyrs held their breath; all the flowers in the
grove bloomed; the streams formed by the three fountains suspended their
course; the Satyrs and the Fauns, the better to listen, pricked up their
acute ears; Echo repeated these beautiful words to all the surrounding
rocks; and all the Dryads emerged from the bosom of the green trees, to
admire the one that Philomela and her companion had just sung.</p>

<h3>The Departure of Lycon.</h3>

</div>

<p>When Renown, with the sound of its trumpet, had announced to the
rustic divinities and to the shepherds of Cynthus the departure of
Lycon, all these gloomy woods resounded with bitter complaints.  Echo
repeated them sadly to all the surrounding valleys.  We no longer heard
the soft sound of the flute or that of the oboe.  Even the shepherds, in
their pain, broke their pipes.  Everything was languishing:  the tender
greenery of the trees was beginning to fade; the sky, hitherto so
serene, was laden with black storms; the cruel North Winds were already
making the groves quiver as in winter.</p>

<p>The divinities, even the most rustic, were not insensitive to this
loss; the Dryads came out of the hollow trunks of the old oaks to miss
Lycon.  There formed an assembly of these sad divinities around a great
tree which raised its branches towards the heavens, and which covered
with its thick shade the earth, its mother, for several centuries.</p>

<p>Alas!  Around this old knotty trunk of prodigious size, the Nymphs of
this wood, accustomed to their dances and their playful games, came to
tell of their misfortune.  "It's done!" they said, "we shall never see
Lycon again:  he is leaving us; enemy fortune relieves us of it; it is
going to be the ornament and the delights of another grove happier than
ours.  No, it is no longer possible to hope to hear his voice, nor to
see him shooting the bow, and piercing the swift birds with his
arrows."</p>

<p>Pan himself ran up, having forgotten his flute; the Fauns and the
Satyrs suspended their dances.  Even the birds were no longer singing:
only the dreadful cries of owls and other birds of bad omen could be
heard.  Philomela and her companions kept a mournful silence.</p>

<p>Then Flora and Pomona suddenly appeared with a laughing air, in the
middle of the grove, holding hands:  one was crowned with flowers, and
made them spring under her footprints on the grass; the other carried in
a cornucopia all the fruits that autumn scatters on the earth to pay man
for his pains.</p>

<p>"Take comfort," they said to this assembly of dismayed gods:  "Lycon
is leaving, it is true; but he does not abandon this mountain to Apollo.
Soon you will see him again here cultivating our fortunate gardens
himself:  his hand planted there the green shrubs, the plants which
nourish man, and the flowers which delight him.  O North Winds, take
care never to wither with your pestilent breaths these gardens where
Lycon will take innocent pleasures.  He will prefer simple nature to
pomp and orderly entertainment; he will love these places; he abandons
them with regret."</p>

<p>At these words, sadness changes into joy; they sing the praises of
Lycon; it is said that he will be a lover of gardens, as Apollo was a
shepherd leading the herds of Admetus:  a thousand divine songs fill the
grove, and the name of Lycon passes from the ancient forest to the most
remote countryside.  The shepherds repeat it on their blowpipes:  the
very birds, in their sweet song, make I don't know what sounds
resembling the name of Lycon.  The earth is adorned with flowers and
enriched with fruits.  The gardens, which await his return, prepare for
him the graces of spring and the magnificent gifts of autumn.  Lycon's
mere glances, which he still casts from afar on this pleasant mountain,
fertilize it.  There, after having uprooted the wild and sterile plants,
he will pick the olive and the myrtle, while waiting for Mars to make
him pick laurels elsewhere.</p>

<h3>Diana's Hunt.</h3>

</div>

<p>There was in the country of the Celts, and quite near the famous
sojourn of the Druids, a dark forest whose oaks as old as the earth, had
seen the waters of the deluge, and preserved under their thick branches
a deep night in the middle of the day.  In this remote forest was a
beautiful fountain clearer than crystal, which gave its name to the
place where it flowed.  Diana often went to pierce stags and fallow deer
with her arrows in this forest full of steep and wild rocks.  After
having hunted with ardor, she went to plunge into the pure waters of the
fountain, and the Naiad gloried in delighting the goddess and all the
Nymphs.</p>

<p>One day, Diana hunted in these places a bigger and more furious boar
than that of Calydon.  His back was armed with hard bristles, as spiky
and as horrible as the pikes of a battalion.  His sparkling eyes were
full of blood and fire.  From a gaping, inflamed mouth it spewed foam
mingled with black blood.  His monstrous head resembled the curved prow
of a ship.  He was filthy and covered with the mud in which he had
wallowed.  The burning breath from his maw stirred the air all around
it, and made a terrible noise.  He darted swiftly like lightning; he
overthrew golden harvests, and ravaged all the neighboring fields; he
cut the tall stems of the toughest trees to sharpen his tusks against
their trunks.  His tusks were keen and sharp like the curved swords of
the Persians.</p>

<p>Terrified laborers took refuge in their villages.  The shepherds,
forgetting their weak herds wandering in the pastures, ran towards their
huts.  All were appalled; even the hunters, with their darts and spears,
dared not enter the forest.</p>

<p>Diana alone, having pity on this country, advanced with her golden
quiver and her arrows.  A troop of Nymphs followed her, and she
surpassed them in height by a full head.  She was, in her course,
lighter than zephyrs and quicker than lightning.  She hit the furious
monster, piercing it with one of her arrows below the ear, where the
shoulder begins.  There he began rolling in the waves of his blood; he
uttered cries with which the whole forest resounded, and showed in vain
his tusks ready to tear his enemies.  The Nymphs quivered.  Diana alone
advanced, put her foot on his head, and thrust her dart; then, seeing
herself reddened with the blood of this boar, which had spurted on her,
she bathed in the fountain, and retired charmed at having delivered the
countryside from this monster.</p>

<h3>Aristaeus and Virgil.</h3>

</div>

<p>Virgil, having descended into Hades, entered those fortunate
countrysides where heroes and men inspired by the gods pass a blissful
life on lawns always studded with flowers and interspersed with a
thousand streams.  First the shepherd Aristaeus, who was there among the
demigods, advanced towards him, having learned his name.</p>

<p>"How happy I am," he said, "to see such a great poet!  Your verses
flow softer than dew on tender grass; they have a harmony so sweet, that
they soften the heart, and draw tears from the eyes:  you have done it
for me and for my bees, of which even Homer could be jealous.  I owe to
you, as much as to the Sun, and to Cyrene, the glory which I enjoy.  It
is not yet long since I recited these verses, so tender and so gracious,
to Linus, Hesiod and Homer.  After having heard them, they all three
went to drink water from the river Lethe, to forget them, so distressed
were they to go over in their memory verses so worthy of them, which
they had not written.  You know that the nation of poets is jealous.
Come among them and take your place."</p>

<p>"It will be very bad, this place," replied Virgil, "since they are so
jealous.  I shall have bad hours to pass in their company; I see that
your bees were no easier to irritate than this chorus of poets."</p>

<p>"It is true," resumed Aristaeus; "they buzz like bees; like them,
they have a piercing sting, to attack whatever inflames their
anger."</p>

<p>"I shall still have," said Virgil, "another great man to avoid here;
it is the divine Orpheus.  How do you live together?"</p>

<p>"Pretty badly," replied Aristaeus.  "He is still jealous of his wife,
like the other three of the glory of verse; but as for you, he will
receive you well, for you have treated him honorably, and you have
spoken much more wisely than Ovid of his quarrel with the women of
Thrace, who massacred him.  But let's not delay any longer; let us enter
this little sacred grove, watered by so many fountains clearer than
crystal:  you will see that the whole sacred troop will rise to do you
honor.  Don't you already hear the lyre of Orpheus?  Listen to Linus who
sings of the fight of the gods against the giants.  Homer prepares to
sing Achilles, who avenges the death of Patroclus by that of Hector.
But Hesiod is the one you have most to fear; for, in the mood he is in,
he will be very sorry that you have dared to treat with so much elegance
all the rustic things which have been his lot."</p>

<p>Scarcely had Aristaeus finished these words than they arrived in that
cool shade where reigns an eternal enthusiasm which possesses these
divine men.  All got up; Virgil was seated and asked to sing his verses.
He sang them at first with modesty, then with transport.  The most
jealous felt in spite of themselves a sweetness that delighted them.
The lyre of Orpheus, which had enchanted the rocks and the woods, fell
from his hands, and bitter tears flowed from his eyes.  Homer forgot,
for a moment, the rapid magnificence of the <i>Iliad</i> and the
agreeable variety of the <i>Odyssey</i>.  Linus believed that these
beautiful verses had been made by his father Apollo; he was motionless,
seized, and suspended by such a sweet song.  Hesiod, deeply moved, could
not resist this charm.</p>

<p>Finally, coming back to himself a little, he pronounced these words
full of jealousy and indignation:  "O Virgil, you have written verses
more durable than brass and bronze.  But I predict that one day we will
see a child who will translate them into his language, and who will
share with you the glory of having sung of the bees."</p>

<h3>Indiscreet Prayer of Neleus, grandson of Nestor.</h3>

</div>

<p>Of all the mortals who had been loved by the gods, none had been
dearer to them than Nestor; they had poured upon him their most precious
gifts, wisdom, profound knowledge of men, sweet and insinuating
eloquence.  All the Greeks listened to him with admiration; and, in
extreme old age, he had absolute power over hearts and minds.  The gods,
before the end of his days, wanted to grant him another favor, which was
to see the birth of a son of Peisistratus.</p>

<p>When he came into the world, Nestor took him on his knees, and
raising his eyes to heaven:  "O Pallas," said he, "you have fulfilled
the measure of your good deeds; I have nothing more to wish for on
earth, except that you fill with your spirit the child you showed me.
You will add, I am sure, mighty goddess, this favor to all those I have
received from you.  I do not ask to see the time when my wishes will be
granted; the earth has carried me too long; cut, daughter of Jupiter,
the thread of my days."</p>

<p>Having spoken these words, a sweet sleep fell on his eyes, he was
united with those of death; and, without effort, without pain, his soul
left his body frozen and almost annihilated by three ages of man he had
lived.</p>

<p>This grandson of Nestor was called Neleus.  Nestor, to whom the
memory of his father had always been dear, wanted him to bear that name.
When Neleus was out of infancy, he went to make a sacrifice to Minerva,
in a wood near the town of Pylos, which was consecrated to this goddess.
After the victims, crowned with flowers, had had their throats slit,
while those who had accompanied him were busy with the ceremonies which
followed the immolation, while some were chopping wood, while others
were drawing fire from the veins of the pebbles, that the victims were
flayed, and that they were cut into several pieces, all being far from
the altar, Neleus remained near.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard the earth tremble; from the hollows of the trees
issued frightful bellows; the altar seemed on fire, and on top of the
flames appeared a woman with an air so majestic and so venerable, that
Neleus was dazzled.  Her figure was above the human form; her looks were
more piercing than lightning; there was nothing soft or effeminate about
her beauty:  it was full of grace, and showed strength and vigor.
Neleus, feeling the impression of the divinity, prostrated himself on
the ground:  all his limbs were shaken by a violent trembling; his blood
froze in his veins; his tongue clung to his palate and could no longer
utter a word:  he remained bewildered, motionless and almost lifeless.
Then Pallas gives him back the strength that had abandoned him.</p>

<p>"Fear nothing," said this goddess to him; "I descended from the top
of Olympus to show you the same love that I made your ancestor Nestor
feel:  I put your happiness in your hands, I will grant all your wishes;
but think carefully about what you must ask of me."</p>

<p>Then Neleus, recovering from his astonishment and charmed by the
sweetness of the goddess's words, felt within him the same assurance as
if he had only been before a mortal person.  He was at the entrance of
youth, at that age when the pleasures which one begins to feel occupy
and carry away the whole soul; he had not yet known bitterness, an
inseparable consequence of pleasures; he had not yet been instructed by
experience.</p>

<p>"O goddess!" he exclaimed, "if I can always taste the sweetness of
voluptuousness, all my wishes will be fulfilled."</p>

<p>The air of the goddess had previously been gay and open:  at these
words she took on a cold and serious air:  "You only count," she told
him, "what flatters the senses; well! you will be satiated with the
pleasures your heart desires."</p>

<p>The goddess immediately disappeared.  Neleus left the altar and went
back to Pylos.  He saw flowers under his feet springing up and blooming
with such a delicious smell that men have never felt such a precious
perfume.  The country is embellished, and takes a form that charms the
eyes of Neleus.  The beauty of the Graces, companions of Venus, spread
over all the women who appeared before him.  Everything he drank became
nectar, everything he ate became ambrosia:  his soul was drowned in an
ocean of pleasure.  Voluptuousness seized Neleus's heart, he no longer
lived except for her; he was now only occupied with one care, which was
that the diversions would always follow one another, and that there
would not be a single moment when his senses are not agreeably
charmed.</p>

<p>The more pleasures he tasted, the more ardently he desired them.  His
mind softened and lost all its vigor; business became a horribly heavy
weight to him; everything serious gave him mortal grief.  He drove away
from his sight the wise advisers who had been brought together by
Nestor, and who were regarded as the most precious inheritance that this
prince had left to his grandson.  Reason, useful remonstrances, became
the object of his strongest aversion, and he shuddered if anyone opened
his mouth before him to give him wise advice.</p>

<p>He had a magnificent palace built, where only gold, silver, and
marble gleamed, where everything was lavished to satisfy the eyes and
elicit pleasure.  The fruit of so much care to satisfy himself was
boredom, anxiety.  No sooner would he have what he wanted than he became
disgusted with it:  he had to change his residence often, run constantly
from palace to palace, tear down and rebuild.  The beautiful, the
agreeable no longer touched him; he needed the singular, the bizarre,
the extraordinary:  everything that was natural and simple seemed to him
insipid, and he fell into such numbness that he no longer lived, that he
no longer felt except by shocks and jerks.</p>

<p>Pylos, the capital, changed face.  They loved work there, they
honored the gods; good faith reigned in commerce; everything was in
order; and the people themselves found in the useful occupations which
succeeded one another without overwhelming them, ease and peace.
Unbridled luxury took the place of decency and real wealth:  everything
was lavished on vain amenities, sought-after conveniences.  Houses,
gardens, public buildings changed form, everything became singular; the
great, the majestic, which were always simple, disappeared.</p>

<p>But what was even more annoying, the inhabitants, following the
example of Neleus, only loved, esteemed, sought pleasure:  it was
pursued at the expense of innocence and virtue; they got agitated, they
tormented themselves to seize a vain and fugitive shadow of happiness,
and they lost their peace and tranquility; no one was happy, because
they wanted to be too happy, because they didn't know how to suffer or
expect anything.  Agriculture and other useful arts had become almost
degrading; it was those that softness had invented who were in honor,
who led to wealth, and who were lavished with encouragement.</p>

<p>The treasures that Nestor and Pisistratus had amassed were soon
dissipated; State revenues fell prey to thoughtlessness and greed.  The
people murmured, the great complained; the wise alone kept silence for
some time; they finally spoke, and their respectful voice was heard by
Neleus.</p>

<p>His eyes opened; his heart softened.  He still had recourse to
Minerva:  he complained to the goddess of her ease in granting rash
wishes; he conjured her to withdraw her perfidious gifts:  he asked her
for wisdom and justice.</p>

<p>"How blind I was!" he cried, "but I know my mistake, I detest the
fault I have made, I want to repair it, and seek in the application of
my duties, in the care of relieving my people, and in the innocence and
purity of morals, the rest and happiness that I have vainly sought in
the pleasures of the senses."</p>

<h3>The Shepherd Cleobulus and the Girl Phidile.</h3>

</div>

<p>A dreamy shepherd led his flock on the flowery banks of the Achelous
River.  The Fauns and the Satyrs, hidden in the neighboring groves,
danced on the grass to the soft sounds of his flute. The Naiads, hidden
in the waves of the river, raised their heads above the reeds to listen
to his songs.  Achelous himself, leaning on his urn, showed his
forehead, where only one horn remained from his fight with the great
Hercules, and this melody suspended for a little time the sorrows of
this god.</p>

<p>The shepherd was little touched to see these Naiads who admired him:
he thought only of the shepherdess Phidile, simple, naive, without any
finery, to whom fortune never gave borrowed luster, and whom the Graces
alone had adorned and embellished with their own hands.  She left her
village, thinking only of grazing her sheep.  She alone was unaware of
her beauty.  All the other shepherdesses were jealous.</p>

<p>The shepherd loved her and dared not tell her.  What he loved most
about her was that simple and severe virtue which kept lovers away, and
which constitutes the true charm of beauty.  But the ingenious passion
found the art of representing what one would not dare to say openly:  he
thus finished all his most pleasant songs, to start one which could
touch the heart of this shepherdess.  He knew she loved the virtue of
heroes who gained glory in battle:  he sang, under an assumed name, of
his own adventures; for, at that time, even the heroes were shepherds,
and did not despise the staff.  So, he sang like this:</p>

<p>"When Polynices went to besiege the city of Thebes to overthrow his
brother Eteocles from the throne, all the kings of Greece appeared under
arms, and drove their chariots against the besieged.  Adrastus,
father-in-law of Polynices, slaughtered the troops of soldiers and the
captains, like a reaper, with his sharp scythe, cuts the harvest.  On
the other hand, the divine Amphiaraus, who had foreseen his misfortune,
advanced into the fray, and was suddenly engulfed by the earth, which
opened its depths to precipitate him into the dark banks of the Styx.
As he fell, he lamented his misfortune of having had an unfaithful wife.
Quite near there, we saw the two brothers, sons of Oedipus, attacking
each other furiously; like a leopard and a tiger tearing each other
apart in the rocks of the Caucasus, they both rolled in the sand, each
looking thirsty for his brother's blood.</p>

<p>"During this horrible spectacle, Cleobulus, who had followed
Polynices, fought against a valiant Theban whom the god Mars rendered
almost invincible.  The Theban's arrow, led by the god, would have
pierced the neck of Cleobulus, who promptly turned away.  Immediately
Cleobulus plunged his sting to the bottom of the entrails.  The Theban's
blood streamed, his eyes went out, his good looks and his pride left
him:  death erased his beautiful features.  His young wife, from the top
of a tower, saw him dying, and her heart was pierced with inconsolable
pain.  In his misfortune, I found him happy to have been loved and
pitied:  I would die like him with pleasure, provided that I could be
loved in the same way.  What use is the value and the glory of the most
famous fights?  What use is youth and beauty when you can neither please
nor touch what you love?"</p>

<p>The shepherdess, who had listened to such a tender song, understood
that this shepherd was Cleobulus, conqueror of the Theban.  She became
sensible to the glory he had acquired, to the graces that shone in him,
and to the evils he suffered for her.  She gave him her hand and her
faith.  A happy marriage joined them:  soon their happiness was envied
by the surrounding shepherds and rural deities.  They equaled by their
union, by their innocent life, by their rustic pleasures, even in
extreme old age, the sweet destiny of Philemon and Baucis.</p>

<h3>The Adventures of Melesichthon.</h3>

</div>

<p>Melesichthon, born at Megara, of an illustrious race among the
Greeks, thought in his youth only of imitating in war the examples of
his ancestors:  he signaled his valor and his talents in several
expeditions:  and as he was inclined towards magnificence, he incurred
tremendous expenses, which soon ruined him.  He was forced to retire to
a country house by the sea, where he lived in profound solitude with his
wife Proxinoe.  She had spirit, courage and pride.  Her beauty and birth
had made her sought after by much richer parties than Melesichthon; but
she had preferred him to all the others, for his own merit.</p>

<p>These two people, who, by their virtue and their friendship, had made
each other mutually happy for several years, then began to make each
other mutually unhappy by the compassion they had for each other.
Melesichthon would have borne his misfortunes more easily, if he could
have suffered them alone, and without a person who was so dear to him.
Proxinoe felt she was increasing Melesichthon's pains.  They sought
consolation with two children who seemed to have been formed by the
Graces.  The son was named Melibeus, and the daughter Poemenis.</p>

<p>Melibeus, at a tender age, was already beginning to show strength,
skill and courage:  he overcame the children of his neighborhood in
wrestling, running and other exercises.  He plunged into the forests,
and his arrows struck blows no less sure than those of Apollo; he
followed this god even more in the sciences and in the fine arts than in
bodily exercises.  Melesichthon, in his solitude, taught him everything
that can cultivate and adorn the mind, everything that can make virtue
love and regulate morals.  Melibeus had a simple, gentle and ingenuous
air, but noble, firm and bold.  Whenever his father looked at him,
Melesichthon's eyes would flood with tears.</p>

<p>Poemenis was instructed by her mother in all the fine arts that
Minerva gave to humanity:  she added to the most exquisite works the
charms of a voice which she joined with a lyre more touching than that
of Orpheus.  To see her, one would have thought it was young Diana, who
had come from the floating island where she was born.  Her blond hair
was tied casually behind her head; a few escapees floated on her neck in
the winds.  She only had on a light dress, with a belt that raised it up
a little to make her more capable of movement.  Without adornment, she
effaced all that one could see that was most beautiful, and she did not
know it:  she had never even dreamed of looking at herself on the edge
of the fountains; she only saw her family, and thought only of
working.</p>

<p>But the father, overwhelmed with boredom, and no longer seeing any
recourse in his affairs, sought only solitude.  His wife and children
only increased his torment.  He often went to the shore of the sea, at
the foot of a great rock full of savage caves:  there he lamented his
misfortunes; then he entered a deep valley, which a thick wood concealed
from the rays of the sun in the middle of the day.  He sat down on the
grass which bordered a clear fountain, and all the saddest thoughts
returned in droves to his heart.  Sweet sleep was far from his eyes, he
only spoke moaning; old age came before time to wither and wrinkle his
face; he even forgot all the needs of life, and succumbed to his
pain.</p>

<p>One day, as he was in this deep valley, he fell asleep from weariness
and exhaustion:  then he saw in a dream the goddess Ceres, crowned with
golden wheatstalks, who presented herself to him with a gentle and
majestic face.</p>

<p>"Why," she said to him, calling him by his name, "do you allow
yourself to be beaten down by the rigors of fortune?"</p>

<p>"Alas," he replied, "my friends have abandoned me; I have no more
property; I only have lawsuits and creditors left; my birth is the
height of my misfortune, and I cannot bring myself to work like a slave
to earn my living."</p>

<p>Then Ceres answered him:  "Does nobility come from possessions?
Doesn't it rather come from imitating the virtue of one's ancestors?
There are no nobles except those who are just.  Live on little:  earn
this little by your work; do not be a burden to anyone:  you will be the
noblest of all men.  The human race makes itself miserable by its
softness and its false glory.  If you lack the necessary things, why do
you want to owe them to anyone but yourself?  Do you lack the courage to
give them to yourself by a laborious life?"</p>

<p>After saying this, immediately she presented him with a golden street
chariot with a cornucopia.  Then Bacchus appeared crowned with ivy, and
holding a thyrsus in his hand; he was followed by Pan, who played the
flute, and made the Fauns and Satyrs dance.  Pomona showed herself laden
with fruit, and Flora adorned with the brightest and most fragrant
flowers.  All the rural deities cast a favorable glance on
Melesichthon.</p>

<p>He awoke, understanding the force and the meaning of this divine
dream; he felt comforted and full of taste for all the labors of rural
life.  He spoke of this dream to Proxinoe, who agreed with his feelings.
The next day they dismissed their useless servants; one no longer saw
among them people whose only employment was the service of their
persons.  They no longer had either chariot or driver.</p>

<p>Proxinoe with Poemenis spun while leading their sheep to graze; then
they wove fabrics and tapestries; then they cut and sewed their own
clothes and those of the rest of the family.  Instead of the works of
silk, gold, and silver which they had accustomed to make with the
exquisite art of Minerva, they no longer exercised their fingers except
on spindles or other similar works.  They prepared with their own hands
the vegetables they picked from their garden to feed the whole house.
The milk from their herd, which they went to milk, completed the
abundance.  They didn't buy anything; everything was prepared quickly
and effortlessly.  Everything was good, simple, natural, seasoned by the
inseparable appetite for sobriety and hard work.</p>

<p>In such a rural life, everything was neat and clean.  All the
tapestries were sold, but the walls of the house were white, and nothing
dirty or disturbed could be seen anywhere; the furniture was never
covered in dust; the beds were coarse, but clean.  The kitchen itself
had a cleanliness which is not found in large houses; everything was
neat and shiny.</p>

<p>To treat the family on holidays, Proxinoe made excellent cakes.  She
had bees whose honey was sweeter than that which flowed from the trunks
of hollow oaks during the golden age.  The cows came of their own accord
to offer streams of milk.  This industrious woman had in her garden all
the plants which can help to nourish man in every season; and she was
always the first to have the fruits and vegetables of every season:  she
even had many flowers, part of which she sold, after having used the
other to adorn her house.  The daughter assisted her mother, and tasted
no other pleasure than that of singing while working, or driving her
sheep in the pastures.  No other herd equaled hers:  contagion and even
wolves dared not approach it.  As she sang, her tender lambs danced on
the grass, and all the surrounding echoes seemed to take pleasure in
repeating her songs.</p>

<p>Melesichthon himself plowed his field:  he himself drove his plow,
sowed and reaped:  he found the work of agriculture less hard, more
innocent and more useful than that of war.  No sooner had he mowed the
tender grass of his meadows than he hastened to collect the gifts of
Ceres, which paid him a hundredfold for the grain sown.  Soon Bacchus
was pouring out for him a nectar worthy of the table of the gods.
Minerva also gave him the fruit of her olive tree, which is so useful to
man.  Winter was the season of rest, when all the assembled family
enjoyed innocent joy, and thanked the gods for being so disillusioned
with false pleasures.  They ate meat only in the sacrifices, and their
flocks were only intended for the altars.</p>

<p>Melibeus showed almost none of the passions of youth:  he drove large
herds; he cut down great oaks in the forests; he dug little canals to
water the meadows; he was tireless in relieving his father.  His
pleasures, when work was not in season, were hunting, racing with young
people of his own age, and reading, for which his father had given him a
taste.</p>

<p>Soon Melesichthon, accustoming himself to such a simple life, saw
himself richer than he had been before.  He had at home only the
necessaries of life; but he had them all in abundance.  He had almost no
society except in his family.  They all loved each other; they made each
other mutually happy:  they lived far from the palaces of kings, and
from the pleasures that one buys so dearly:  theirs were sweet,
innocent, simple, easy to find, and without any dangerous
consequences.</p>

<p>Melibeus and Poemenis were thus brought up with a taste for rural
work.  They remembered their birth only to have more courage in enduring
poverty.  The abundance returned to the whole house did not bring back
ostentation:  the whole family was always simple and industrious.</p>

<p>Everyone said to Melesichthon:  "Riches are returning to you, it's
time to take back your old brilliance."</p>

<p>Thus, he answered with these words:  "To whom do you want me to
attach myself, either to the splendor which had ruined me, or to a
simple and laborious life which has made me rich and happy?"</p>

<p>Finally, finding himself one day in that dark wood where Ceres had
instructed him by such a useful dream, he rested there on the grass with
as much joy as there had been bitterness in the past.  He fell asleep,
and the goddess, appearing to him, as in his first dream, said these
words to him:  "True nobility consists in receiving nothing from anyone,
and in doing good to others.  Receive nothing, then, except from the
fruitful womb of the earth and from your own work.  Be careful never to
leave, through softness or false glory, what is the natural and
inexhaustible source of all good."</p>

<h3>The Adventures of Aristonous.</h3>

</div>

<p>Sophronymus, having lost the estate of his ancestors by shipwrecks
and other misfortunes, consoled himself with his virtue in the island of
Delos.  There he sang, on a golden lyre, the marvels of the god who is
worshiped there; he cultivated the Muses by whom he was loved; he
curiously researched all the secrets of nature, the course of the stars
and the heavens, the order of the elements, the structure of the
universe, which he measured with his compass, the virtue of plants and
the conformation of animals; but above all he studied himself, and
applied himself to adorning his soul by virtue.  Thus fortune, by
wishing to bring him down, had raised him to true glory, which is that
of wisdom.</p>

<p>While living happily without possessions in this retreat, he saw one
day, on the shore of the sea, a venerable old man who was unknown to
him:  he was a stranger who had just landed on the island.  This old man
admired the shores of the sea, in which he knew that this island had
formerly been floating; he contemplated this coast, where rose above the
sands and the rocks, small hills always covered with a budding and
flowering grass; he could not look enough at the pure fountains and the
rapid streams which watered this delicious countryside; he advanced
towards the sacred groves which surround the temple of the god; he was
astonished to see this greenery which the north winds never dare to
tarnish, and he was already gazing at the temple, of Parian marble
whiter than snow, surrounded by tall columns of jasper.</p>

<p>Sophronymus was no less attentive in considering this old man:  his
white beard fell over his chest; there was nothing deformed about his
wrinkled face:  he was still free from the insults of a decrepit old
age:  his eyes showed a gentle vivacity; his figure was tall and
majestic, but a little bent, and an ivory staff supported him.</p>

<p>"O stranger," said Sophronymus to him, "what are you looking for in
this island, which seems to be unknown to you?  If it is the temple of
God, you see it from afar, and I offer to lead you there; for I fear the
Gods, and I have learned what Jupiter wants us to do to help
strangers."</p>

<p>"I accept," replied the old man, "the offer you make to me with so
many marks of kindness; I pray to the gods to reward your love for
strangers.  Let's go to the temple."</p>

<p>Along the way, he told Sophronymus the subject of his journey:  "My
name," he said, "is Aristonous, a native of Clazomenae, a city of Ionia,
situated on that pleasant coast which juts out into the sea, and seems
to join the island of Chios, fortunate homeland of Homer.  I was born of
poor, though noble, parents.  My father, named Polystratus, who was
already responsible for a large family, did not want to bring me up; he
had me exposed by one of his friends from Teos.  An old woman from
Eritrea, who had property near the place where I was exposed, fed me
goat's milk in her house:  but, as she had barely enough to live on, as
soon as I was old enough to serve, she sold me to a slave trader who
took me to Lycia.  He sold me at Patara to a rich and virtuous man named
Alcinus; this Alcinus took care of me in my youth.</p>

<p>"I appeared to him to be docile, moderate, sincere, affectionate, and
diligent in all honest things about which they wanted to instruct me; he
devoted me to the arts that Apollo favors:  he made me learn music, body
exercises, and above all the art of healing men's wounds.  I soon
acquired quite a reputation in this art, which is so necessary; and
Apollo, who inspired me, revealed marvelous secrets to me.</p>

<p>"Alcinus, who loved me more and more, and who was delighted to see
the success of his care for me, freed me, and sent me to Damocles, king
of Lycaonia, who, living in delights, loved life and feared losing it.
This king, in order to retain me, gave me great wealth.  A few months
later, Damocles died.  His son, irritated against me by flatterers,
served to disgust me with all things that have luster.</p>

<p>"At last, I felt a strong desire to see Lycia again, where I had
spent my childhood so peacefully.  I hoped to find there Alcinus, who
had raised me, and who was the first author of all my fortune.  On
arriving in this country, I learned that Alcinus had died after having
lost all his possessions and suffered with great constancy the
misfortunes of old age.</p>

<p>"I went to scatter flowers and tears on his ashes; I put an honorable
inscription on his tomb, and I asked what had become of his children.  I
am told that the only one who remained, named Orcilochus, unable to
bring himself to appear without property in his homeland, where his
father had had so much splendor, had embarked on a foreign vessel, to go
and lead an obscure life in some remote island of the sea.  I was told
that this Orcilochus had been shipwrecked, a short time later, towards
the island of Carpathos, and that thus there remained nothing any more
of the family of my benefactor Alcinus.</p>

<p>"Immediately I thought of buying the house where he had lived along
with the fertile fields he had around.  I was very glad to see these
places again, which reminded me of the sweet memory of such a pleasant
age and such a good master:  it seemed to me that I was still in the
flower of my first years when I had served Alcinus.  No sooner had I
bought the property of his estate from his creditors than I was obliged
to go to Clazomenae:  my father Polystratus and my mother Phidile were
dead.</p>

<p>"I had two brothers who lived badly together; as soon as I arrived at
Clazomenae, I presented myself to them in a simple dress, like a man
deprived of means, showing them the marks, which indicate children who
have been exposed.  They were astonished to see an increase in the
number of the heirs of Polystratus, who were to share his small
succession; they even wanted to contest my birth, and they refused to
recognize me before the judges.  Then, to punish their inhumanity, I
declared that I consented to be a stranger to them; and I asked that
they also be excluded forever from being my heirs.  The judges ordered
it, and then I showed the riches which I had brought into my vessel; I
discovered to them that I was that Aristonous who had acquired so many
treasures from Damocles, king of Lycaonia, and that I had never
married.</p>

<p>"My brothers repented of having treated me so unjustly, and in the
desire to be able to be my heirs one day, they made the last efforts,
but in vain, to insinuate themselves into my friendship.  Their division
caused our father's goods to be sold:  I bought them, and they had the
pain of seeing all our father's goods pass into the hands of him to whom
they had not wanted to give the least part; so, they all fell into
terrible poverty.</p>

<p>"But, after they had felt their fault enough, I wanted to show them
my good nature:  I forgave them, I received them in my house, I gave
them each the means to earn well in the sea trade:  I brought all
together; they and their children lived together peacefully at my house,
I became the common father of all these different families.  By their
union and their application to work, they soon amassed considerable
wealth.</p>

<p>"However old age, as you see, has come knocking at my door:  it has
whitened my hair and wrinkled my face; it warns me that I shall not long
enjoy such perfect prosperity.  Before dying, I wanted to see one last
time this land which is so dear to me, and which touches me more than my
own homeland, this Lycia where I learned to be good and wise under the
guidance of the virtuous Alcinus.</p>

<p>"Passing there again by sea, I found a merchant from the Cyclades
islands, who assured me that there still remained in Delos a son of
Orcilochus, who imitated the wisdom and virtue of his grandfather
Alcinus.  Immediately I left the road to Lycia, and I hastened to come
and seek, under the auspices of Apollo, on his island, this precious
remains of a family to whom I owe everything.</p>

<p>"I have little time left to live:  the Fate, enemy of this sweet rest
which the gods so rarely grant to mortals, will hasten to cut my days;
but I shall be glad to die, provided my eyes, before closing to the
light, have seen my master's grandson.  Speak now, O you who dwell with
him in this island:  do you know him? can you tell me where I will find
him?  If you show him to me, may the gods, as a reward, show you, on
your knees, the children of your children up to the fifth generation!
may the gods preserve all your house in peace and abundance, for the
fruit of your virtue!"</p>

<p>While Aristonous spoke thus, Sophronymus shed tears mingled with joy
and pain.  Finally, he threw himself, without being able to speak, on
the old man's neck; he kissed him, he hugged him, and he uttered with
difficulty these words interspersed with sighs:  "I am, O my father, the
one you are looking for:  you see Sophronymus, grandson of your friend
Alcinus:  it is I; and I cannot doubt, listening to you, that the gods
have sent you here to alleviate my ills.  Gratitude, which seemed lost
on earth, is found in you alone.  I had heard, in my childhood, that a
famous and rich man, established in Lycaonia, had been nursed at my
grandfather's; but as Orcilochus, my father, who died young, left me in
the cradle, I only knew these things vaguely.  I did not dare to go to
Lycaonia in uncertainty, and I preferred to remain on this island,
consoling myself in my misfortunes by contempt for vain riches, and by
the sweet employment of cultivating the Muses in the sacred house of
Apollo.  Wisdom, which accustoms men to do without little and to be
quiet, has hitherto taken the place of all other goods."</p>

<p>Finishing these words, Sophronymus, seeing himself arrived at the
temple, proposed to Aristonous to make his prayers and his offerings
there.  They made a sacrifice to the god of two sheep whiter than snow,
and of a bull which had a crescent on its forehead between the two
horns; then they sang verses in honor of the god who enlightens the
universe, who regulates the seasons, who presides over the sciences and
who animates the chorus of the nine Muses.  Coming out of the temple,
Sophronymus and Aristonous spent the rest of the day recounting their
adventures.  Sophronymus received the old man at his home with the
tenderness and respect he would have shown even Alcinus, if he had still
been alive.</p>

<p>The next day they set out together, and sailed to Lycia.  Aristonous
led Sophronymus into a fertile countryside, on the banks of the river
Xanthus, in whose waves Apollo, on his return from the hunt, covered
with dust, had so many times immersed his body and washed his beautiful
fair hair.  Along this river they found poplars and willows, whose
tender and budding greenery hid the nests of an infinite number of birds
which sang night and day.  The river, falling from a rock with much
noise and foam, broke its waves in a channel full of small pebbles:  the
whole plain was covered with golden harvests; the hills which rose like
an amphitheater were laden with vines and fruit trees.  There all nature
was smiling and graceful, the sky was soft and serene, and the earth
always ready to draw new riches from its bosom to pay the pains of the
laborer.</p>

<p>Walking along the river, Sophronymus saw a simple, ordinary house;
but of a pleasant architecture, with fair proportions.  He found there
neither marble, nor gold, nor silver, nor ivory, nor purple furniture:
everything was clean and full of charm and convenience, without
magnificence.  A fountain flowed in the middle of the courtyard, and
formed a small channel along a green carpet.  The gardens were not vast;
there one saw fruit and useful plants to eat:  on the two sides of the
garden appeared two groves, whose trees were almost as old as the ground
their mother, and whose thick branches made an impenetrable shade with
the rays of the sun.</p>

<p>They entered a drawing-room, where they made a sweet meal of the
dishes that nature furnished in the gardens, and one saw there nothing
of what the delicacy of men fetches so far and so dearly in the cities;
it was milk as sweet as that which Apollo had the care of milking, while
he was a shepherd with King Admetus; it was more exquisite honey than
that of the bees of Hybla in Sicily, or of Mount Hymettus in Attica:
there were vegetables from the garden, and fruits which had just been
picked.  A wine more delicious than nectar flowed from great vases into
chiseled cups.</p>

<p>During this frugal but sweet and tranquil meal, Aristonous refused to
sit down to table.  At first, he did what he could, under various
pretexts, to hide his modesty:  but finally, as Sophronymus wanted to
urge him, he declared that he would never bring himself to eat with the
grandson of Alcinus, whom he had served so long in the same room.</p>

<p>"That," he said to him, "is where the wise old man used to eat; this
is where he conversed with his friends; that's where he played various
games; here is where he walked while reading Hesiod or Homer; this is
where he rested at night."  Recalling these circumstances, his heart
softened, and tears flowed from his eyes.</p>

<p>After the meal, he took Sophronymus to see the beautiful meadow where
his great bellowing herds roamed, on the edge of the river; then they
saw the herds of sheep returning from the rich pastures, the bleating
mothers full of milk were followed by their leaping little lambs.
Everywhere one saw zealous workmen, who conducted the work for the
interest of their gentle and humane master, who made himself loved by
them, and softened the pains of slavery for them.</p>

<p>Aristonous, having shown Sophronymus this house, these slaves, these
herds, and these lands become so fertile by careful cultivation, said to
him these words:  "I am delighted to see you in the ancient patrimony of
your ancestors:  I am happy, since I put you in possession of the place
where I served Alcinus for so long.  Enjoy in peace what was his; live
happily, and prepare yourself without doubt, by your vigilance, for a
sweeter end than his."</p>

<p>At the same time, he made him a donation of this property, with all
the solemnities prescribed by the laws; and he declared that he would
exclude from his succession his natural heirs if ever should they be
ungrateful enough to contest the donation he had made to the grandson of
Alcinus, his benefactor.  But that was not enough to satisfy
Aristonous's heart.  Before giving away his house, he adorned it
entirely with new furniture, simple and modest indeed, but clean and
agreeable; he filled the attics with rich presents from Ceres, and the
cellars with a wine from Chios, worthy of being served by the hand of
Hebe or Ganymede at the table of the great Jupiter; he also put there
Pramnian wine with an abundant supply of honey from Hymettus and Hybla,
and oil from Attica, almost as sweet as honey itself.  Finally, he added
innumerable fleeces of fine wool, white as snow, the rich skin of the
tender sheep which grazed on the mountains of Arcadia and in the rich
pastures of Sicily.</p>

<p>It was in this state that he gave his house to Sophronymus:  he gave
him another fifty Euboean talents, and reserved for his parents the
estates he possessed in the peninsula of Clazomenae, around Smyrna,
Lebedus and Colophon, which were very valuable.  The donation being
made, Aristonous re-embarked in his vessel, to return to Ionia.
Sophronymus, astonished and touched by such magnificent benefits,
accompanies him to the ship with tears in his eyes, always calling him
his father and hugging him.  Aristonous arrived home very early by a
happy navigation:  none of his relatives dared to complain about what he
had just given to Sophronymus.</p>

<p>"I left," he said to them, "for my last will and testament, this
order, that all my goods will be sold and distributed to the poor of
Ionia, if ever any of you oppose the gift I have just made to the
grandson of Alcinus."</p>

<p>The wise old man lived in peace, and enjoyed the blessings that the
gods had granted to his virtue.  Every year, in spite of his old age, he
made a journey to Lycia, to see Sophronymus again, and to go and make a
sacrifice on the tomb of Alcinus, which he had enriched with the most
beautiful ornaments of architecture and sculpture.  He had ordered that
his own ashes, after his death, should be carried into the same tomb, to
rest with those of his dear master.</p>

<p>Every year, in the spring, Sophronymus, impatient to see him again,
had his eyes constantly turned towards the shore of the sea, to try to
discover the ship of Aristonous, which arrived in that season.  Each
year, he had the pleasure of seeing coming from afar, through the bitter
waves, this ship which was so dear to him; and the arrival of this
vessel was infinitely sweeter to him than all the graces of nature
reviving in the spring, after the rigors of the dreadful winter.</p>

<p>One year, he did not see coming, like the others, this vessel so much
desired; he sighed bitterly; sadness and fear were painted on his face;
sweet sleep fled far from his eyes; no exquisite dish seemed sweet to
him:  he was uneasy, alarmed at the slightest noise; always turned
towards the port, he constantly asked if some ship from Ionia had been
seen.  He saw one; but alas!  Aristonous was not there, it only carried
his ashes in a silver urn.  Amphicles, a former friend of the deceased,
and of about the same age, faithful executor of his last wishes, sadly
brought this urn.  When he approached Sophronymus, they both failed to
speak, and they spoke only through their sobs.</p>

<p>Sophronymus, having kissed the urn, and having sprinkled it with his
tears, spoke thus:  "O old man, you have made my life happy, and you now
cause me the cruelest of all pains:  I will see you no more, death would
be sweet to me to see you, and to follow you into the Elysian Fields,
where your shadow enjoys the blessed peace that the just gods reserve
for virtue.  You have brought justice, piety and gratitude to the earth
in our days:  you have shown in an age of iron the goodness and
innocence of the golden age.  The gods, before crowning you in the abode
of the just, granted you here below a happy, agreeable and long old age:
but, alas! what should last forever is never long enough.  I no longer
feel any pleasure in enjoying your gifts, since I am reduced to enjoying
them without you.  O dear shadow! when will I follow you?  Precious
ashes, if you can still feel something, you will no doubt feel the
pleasure of being mingled with Alcinus's.  Mine will also join in one
day.  In the meantime, all my consolation will be to keep these remains
of what I loved most.  O Aristonous!  O Aristonous! no, you will not
die, and you will always live in the bottom of my heart.  Rather forget
myself than ever forget this amiable man, who loved me so much, who
loved virtue so much, to whom I owe everything."</p>

<p>After these words, interspersed with deep sighs, Sophronymus placed
the urn in the tomb of Alcinus:  he immolated several victims, whose
blood flooded the turf altars which surrounded the tomb:  he poured out
abundant libations of wine and milk; he burned perfumes from the depths
of the Orient, and there arose an odoriferous cloud in the midst of the
air.  Sophronymus established forever, for all the years, in the same
season, funeral games in honor of Alcinus and Aristonous.</p>

<p>People came there from Caria, a happy and fertile country; of the
enchanted banks of the Meander, which is played by so many detours, and
which seems to leave with regret the country which it waters; from the
evergreen shores of the Cayster, from the edges of the Pactolus, which
rolls under its waves a golden sand; of Pamphylia, which Ceres, Pomona
and Flora adorn at will; lastly, the vast plains of Cilicia, watered
like a garden by the torrents which fall from Mount Taurus, always
covered with snow.  During this solemn feast, young boys and girls,
dressed in trailing linen robes whiter than lilies, sang hymns in praise
of Alcinus and Aristonous, for one could not praise one without praising
also the other, nor separate two men so closely united, even after their
death.</p>

<p>What was most marvelous was that, from the first day, while
Sophronymus was making the libations of wine and milk, a myrtle of
greenery and an exquisite smell was born in the middle of the tomb, and
suddenly raised his bushy head to cover the two urns with his boughs and
his shade:  everyone exclaimed that Aristonous, as a reward for his
virtue, had been changed by the gods into such a beautiful tree.
Sophronymus took care to water it himself, and to honor it as a
divinity.</p>

<p>This tree, far from aging, renewed itself decade after decade, and
the gods wanted to show, by this marvel, that virtue, which throws such
a sweet perfume into the memory of men, never dies.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">NOTE.</p>

<p><i>Instead of what is said here of Damocles, we read, in all the
editions prior to that of 1718, the following episode, which we thought
we should keep.  F&eacute;nelon deleted it, probably because he found it
too long in relation to the plan of the entire piece.</i></p>

<p>"Alcinus, who loved me more and more, and who was delighted to see
the success of his care for me, freed me and sent me to Polycrates,
tyrant of Samos, who, in his incredible happiness, always feared that
the fortune, after having flattered him for so long, would betray him
cruelly.  He loved life, which for him was full of delights; he was
afraid of losing it, and wanted to prevent the slightest appearance of
evil:  thus, he was always surrounded by the most famous men in
medicine.</p>

<p>"Polycrates was delighted that I wanted to spend my life with him.
To attach me to him, he gave me great riches, and loaded me with honors.
I lived a long time in Samos, where I could not be sufficiently
surprised to see a man whom fortune seemed to take pleasure in serving
according to all his wishes.  All he had to do was start a war, victory
would follow soon after; he had only to want the most difficult things,
they were done first as if by themselves.  His immense wealth multiplied
every day; all his enemies were cast down at his feet; his health, far
from diminishing, became stronger and more even.  For forty years
already this tyrant, tranquil and happy, had held fortune as if in
chains, without her ever daring to contradict herself in any way, nor
cause him the slightest disappointment in all his designs.</p>

<p>"A prosperity so unheard of among men frightened me for him.  I loved
him sincerely, and I could not help revealing my fear to him:  this made
an impression on his heart; for, although he was softened by delights,
and proud of his power, he did not fail to have some feelings of
humanity, when he was reminded of the gods and the inconstancy of human
things.  He suffered me to tell him the truth, and he was so touched by
my fear for him, that at last he resolved to interrupt the course of his
prosperity by a loss which he wished to prepare for himself.</p>

<p>" 'I can well see,' he said to me, 'that there is no man in his life
who must not experience some disgrace from fortune:  the more one has
been spared from it, the more one has to fear some dreadful revolution.
I, whom she has showered with blessings for so many years, must expect
extreme evils from her, if I do not divert what seems to threaten me.  I
therefore want to hasten to prevent the betrayals of this flattering
fortune.'</p>

<p>"Saying these words, he took from his finger his ring, which was very
expensive, and which he loved very much; he threw it, in my presence,
from the top of a tower into the sea, and hoped, by this loss, to have
satisfied the necessity of undergoing, at least once in his life, the
rigors of fortune.  But it was a blindness caused by his prosperity.
The evils that we choose and cause ourselves are no longer evils; we are
only afflicted by the forced and unforeseen pains with which the gods
strike us.  Polycrates did not know that the real way to prevent fortune
was to detach oneself by wisdom and moderation from all the fragile
goods that it gives.</p>

<p>"The fortune to which he wanted to sacrifice his ring, did not accept
this sacrifice; and Polycrates, in spite of himself, seemed happier than
ever.  A fish had swallowed the ring; the fish had been caught, brought
to Polycrates, prepared to be served at his table, and the ring, found
by a cook in the belly of the fish, was returned to the tyrant, who
turned pale at the sight of such a stubborn fortune at favor.  But the
time was approaching when his prosperity was to change suddenly into
dreadful adversity.  The great king of Persia, Darius, son of Hystaspes,
began the war against the Greeks.  He soon subjugated all the Greek
colonies on the coast of Asia and the neighboring islands, which are in
the Aegean Sea.  Samos was taken; the tyrant was vanquished, and
Orontes, who commanded for the great king, having erected a high cross,
had the tyrant attached to it.  Thus, this man, who had enjoyed such
great prosperity, and who had not even been able to experience the
misfortune he had sought, suddenly perished by the most cruel and
infamous of all tortures.  Thus, nothing threatens men so much with some
great misfortune as too much prosperity.</p>

<p>"This fortune, which cruelly plays with the highest men, also raises
from the dust those who were the most unfortunate.  She had thrown
Polycrates off the top of the wheel, and she had brought me out of the
most miserable of all conditions, to give me great blessings.  The
Persians did not take them from me; on the contrary, they made a great
deal of my skill in curing men, and the moderation with which I had
lived while in favor with the tyrant.  Those who had abused his
confidence and his authority were punished with various tortures.  As I
had never harmed anyone, and had on the contrary done all the good that
I could have done, I remained the only one whom the victors spared, and
whom they treated honorably.  Everyone rejoiced, for I was loved, and
had enjoyed prosperity without envy, because I had never shown
harshness, pride, greed, or injustice.  I spent a few more years quite
quietly in Samos; but at last, I felt a strong desire to see Lycia
again, where I had spent my childhood so peacefully."</p>

<h2>XXXVIII.</h2>

<h3>The Erratic.</h3>

</div>

<p>What fatal thing has happened to Melanthus?  Nothing outside,
everything inside.  His business is going well:  everyone tries to
please him.  What? it's that his spleen smokes.  He went to bed
yesterday the delight of the human race:  this morning, all are ashamed
for him, all must hide him.  Getting up, the fold of a slipper
displeased him:  the whole day will be stormy, and everyone will
suffer.</p>

<p>He is frightening, he is pitiful:  he cries like a child, he roars
like a lion.  A malignant and fierce vapor disturbs and blackens his
imagination, as the ink from his writing-desk smears his fingers.  Don't
go and talk to him about the things he loved best just a moment ago:
because he loved them, he can no longer bear them.  The parties of
entertainment which he has so desired become boring to him, they must be
interrupted.  He seeks to contradict, to complain, to sting others; he
is irritated to see that they do not want to be angry.</p>

<p>Often, he carries his blows in the air, like a furious bull, which
with its sharp horns goes to fight against the winds.  When he lacks a
pretext to attack others, he turns against himself:  he blames himself,
he finds himself good for nothing; he becomes discouraged, he finds it
very bad that people want to console him.  He wants to be alone, and
cannot stand loneliness.</p>

<p>He returns to the company, and sours on it.  They are silent:  this
silence affects the shock.  They speak softly:  he imagines that it is
against him.  They talk aloud:  he finds that they talk too much, and
are too cheerful while he is sad.  One is sad:  this sadness seems to
him a reproach for his faults.  They laugh:  he suspects that they are
making fun of him.</p>

<p>What to do?  To be as firm and as patient as he is unbearable, and to
wait in peace for him to become again tomorrow as wise as he was
yesterday.  This strange mood goes as it comes.  When he takes it on, it
looks like a machine spring that suddenly comes apart; he is as the
possessed are portrayed; his reason is as if upside down; it is unreason
itself in person.  Push him, you will make him say in broad daylight
that it is night:  for there is no longer day or night for a head
dismantled by his whim.</p>

<p>Sometimes he cannot help being astonished by his excesses and his
ardor.  Despite his grief, he smiles at the extravagant words that
escaped him.  But what means of foreseeing these storms, and of warding
off the tempest?  There are none, no good almanacs to predict this bad
weather.</p>

<p>Be careful not to say:  "Tomorrow we will go and amuse ourselves in
such a garden;" the man of today will not be that of tomorrow; he who
promises you now will soon disappear:  you will no longer know where to
take him to remind him of his word; in its place, you will find <i>I
know not what</i>, which has neither form nor name, which cannot have
one, and which you cannot define two consecutive instants in the same
way.  Study it well, then say whatever you please:  it won't be true the
moment after you say it.</p>

<p>This <i>I know not what</i> wants and does not want; he threatens, he
trembles; he mixes ridiculous heights with unworthy baseness.  He cries,
he laughs, he jokes, he is furious.  In his most bizarre and insane
fury, he is pleasant, eloquent, subtle, full of new tricks, although not
even a shadow of reason remains.</p>

<p>Take great care not to say anything to him that is not just, precise
and exactly reasonable:  he would know how to take advantage of it, and
deftly deceive you; he would first pass from his fault to yours, and
would become reasonable for the sole pleasure of convincing you that you
are not.  It is a nothing that made him soar to the skies:  but what has
become of this nothing? he got lost in the melee; it is no longer a
question of it:  he no longer knows what made him angry, he only knows
that he is angry and that he wants to be angry; even then he does not
always know it.</p>

<p>He often imagines that everyone who speaks to him is carried away,
and that it is he who moderates himself, like a man who has jaundice
thinks that everyone he sees is yellow, although the yellow is only in
both his eyes.  But perhaps he will spare certain people to whom he owes
more than to others, or whom he seems to love more?  No, his oddity
favors no one:  he takes everything he finds without choice; the first
comer is good for him to relieve himself:  everything is the same to
him, provided he gets angry; he would say insults to everyone.  He no
longer loves people, he is not loved by them; they persecute him, they
betray him; he owes nothing to anyone.</p>

<p>But wait a moment, here's another scene.  He needs everyone; he loves
them, they love him too; he flatters, he insinuates himself, he
bewitches all those who could no longer bear it; he admits his wrong, he
laughs at his quirks, he counterfeits himself:  and you'd think he's
himself in his outbursts, he counterfeits himself so well.  After this
comedy, played at his own expense, you can well believe that at least he
won't play the demonic anymore.  Alas! you are mistaken:  he will do it
again this evening, to make fun of it tomorrow, without correcting
himself.</p>
