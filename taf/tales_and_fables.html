<h3>The ADVENTURES of ARISTON&Ouml;US.</h3>

</div>

<p>SOPHRONYMUS, having met with a long series of disappointments
both at home and abroad, and being thereby reduced
to the lowest ebb of fortune, sought consolation from his
virtue in the Isle of <i>Delos</i>. There he tuned his golden lyre;
there sang the wonders of the <i>Delian</i> God. He made his court
there to the Muses, who proved as kind as they were fair. The
wonderous works of nature were the constant objects of his contemplation:
there he studied the revolutions of the Heavens, and all
the starry train, the beauteous order of the elements, the fabric
of the terrestrial globe, which he was ever measuring with his
compass, the various qualities of plants, and structure of the brutal
world;&mdash;but above all, in this retreat he pried with a more curious
eye into himself; with pleasure reflected on his superior faculties,
and practised all the virtues that adorn the soul. Thus distress

<!-- page 2 -->

did not debase his noble mind; it only changed the scene, and
gave him new glory by the alteration.</p>

<p>Whilst thus he lived poor, but content in his retirement! he
spied a venerable, grave old man, just landed on the Island. This
stranger with surprise surveyed the sea-banks, well-knowing that
the Isle once floated here and there: but fixed his eyes with more
attention on that side, where the small hills, forever verdant, reared
up their heads above the rocks. He thought he never could admire
enough the crystal springs, and rapid floods, that water this
delightful country. Slowly he moved along towards the hallowed
groves, which shade all round the temple of the God. He gazed
with pleasure on those ever-greens, which the bleak north-winds
durst not blast. With curious eyes he viewed the beauties of the
temple; its <i>Parian</i> marble, white as the new-fallen snow; its stately
pillars of solid jasper. SOPHRONYMUS, with equal curiosity, observed
the good old man. His silver beard fell graceful on his
breast. His face, though wrinkled, no ways was deformed. As yet,
he knew none of the cares of age. His eyes were quick and
lively; his stature tall and majestic; his years, however, made him
decline a little; and when he walked, he wore an ivory staff.
SOPHRONYMUS approached, and thus addressed him: "What is it,
venerable sir, you seek for here? You seem a perfect stranger to
the place. If it is the temple of the God; yonder it stands, and,
if you please, I will conduct you thither. I reverence the Gods,
and know my duty to a stranger."</p>

<p>The old Gentleman replied;&mdash;"With pleasure I accept your
friendly offer. May the kind Gods reward your love to strangers!
Lead to the temple."</p>

<p>As they walked along, he told SOPHRONYMUS
his adventures. "My name," said he, "is ARISTON&Ouml;US: I was born
at <i>Clazomene</i>, a town in <i>Ionia</i>, situate in that pleasant coast that advances
towards the sea, and seems as if it joined the Isle of <i>Chios</i>,

<!-- page 3 -->

the native country of immortal <i>Homer</i>. My parents, though poor,
were both of an illustrious family. POLISTRATUS, that was my
father's name, being encumbered with too large a family, unkindly
ordered a friend of his at <i>Teos</i> to expose me naked to the world, a
tender, helpless infant. A charitable old woman of <i>Erythrea</i>, who
lived hard by, commiserated my unhappy state, and reared me with
goat's milk as her own. But as her circumstances were very narrow,
when I was capable of service, she sold me to a merchant who
conveyed me, as his slave, to <i>Lycia</i>. He sold me again at <i>Patara</i>&mdash;luckily
for me&mdash;to <i>Alcinus</i>, a Gentleman of fortune and distinguished
merit.</p>

<p>"This <i>Alcinus</i> was a second father to me in my
youth. I was so happy as to be thought good-natured, sober, honest,
well-inclined, and attentive to all good advice. By his direction
I applied myself to Apollo's favourite arts. Music and exercise
were my amusements; but his healing faculty my chief regard.
I soon made large improvements in that so necessary science;
and assisted by the inspiration of the God, found out a thousand
curious secrets. <i>Alcinus</i>, who still grew more indulgent as I advanced 
in years, well-pleased with the success of all his cares,
made me a freeman, and sent me to <i>Damocles</i>, the King of
<i>Lycaonia</i>; a Prince much given to luxury and ease, who made this
life his care, and trembled at the thoughts of death. The monarch,
to attach me to his interest, made me rich and great.</p>

<p>"Damocles,
some few years after died. His son, incensed against me, by the
instigation of some parasites about him, gave me a distaste to the
pomp and grandeur of a court. In short, I had a strong inclination 
to revisit <i>Lycia</i>, where I had spent my younger years with so
much satisfaction. I lived in hopes of seeing once again my patron,
my foster-father, my benefactor. On my first arrival I heard the
melancholy news that he was dead; that just before his decease he
lost his whole estate, and suffered manfully the frowns of fortune,

<!-- page 4 -->

and the cares of age. I visited his tomb, strewed flowers upon
his venerable ashes, and bathed them with my tears. To perpetuate 
his memory, I ordered his character to be engraved upon the
stone; and then enquired into his family-concerns. I was informed
that <i>Orchilochus</i> was his only surviving son, who disdaining to live
in penury, and in a cottage, where his father had before him lived
in such grandeur and repute, was resolved to lead a solitary life in
some far distant Island. <i>Orchilochus</i>, it seems, soon after was cast
away upon the coast of <i>Carphatus</i>; so that the whole race of my
dear friend and benefactor then was quite extinct.</p>

<p>"I determined
immediately to purchase the estate, where formerly he lived in ease
and plenty. With pleasure I surveyed the fruitful fields around,
which brought to my remembrance pleasures past, and the dear
image of my worthy master. I could scarce persuade myself but
that I was young again, and gay, as when I served <i>Alcinus</i>. Soon
as I had settled this purchase with his creditors, affairs, of a quite
different nature, called me again to <i>Clazomene</i>. My father <i>Polistratus</i>,
and <i>Phidilis</i> my mother, were both dead. My restless, uneasy
brothers, were forever at variance one with another. No sooner was
I arrived at <i>Clazomene</i>, but I made myself known to them, in the
tattered garb of a poor, miserable slave, overwhelmed with his
misfortunes, and showed the marks that infants generally bear,
who are exposed as I was. They were nettled at this new discovery,
nor wanted unexpected heirs to make their little less. They strenuously
insisted, I was a bold impostor, and denied my right in
open court. In return to this ungenerous, unnatural declaration, I
publicly resigned my title, consented to be deemed a perfect stranger,
and moved that they might equally disclaim their right in me. A
decree was past accordingly; then I threw off the slave; discovered
the treasure I had on board; assured them, that I was the same

<!-- page 5 -->

ARISTON&Ouml;US, who had long been the peculiar favourite of <i>Damocles</i>,
the late King of <i>Lycaonia</i>, and that I never had been married.</p>

<p>"My brothers soon repented of their coldness towards me, and
hoping still in time to be my heirs, were obsequious to the last
degree, and studied, but to no purpose, to oblige me. Their perpetual 
jars compelled them to expose that little they had left to public 
sale. I was the fairest purchaser; and they, with shame and
deep reluctance, saw him legally possessed of all their father had,
whose right to the least part, they had so publicly contested. In a
short time, by their ill conduct, all grew miserably poor. But after
I had humbled them, and made them feel my just resentment, I
gave them large demonstrations of love and friendship. Freely
I forgave them all; received them in my house; by proper presents,
put it in their powers to trade abroad, and get estates. The family
was all harmony; they and their children lived with me in perfect
peace. They all esteemed me as their common parent. By this
happy union, and their diligence and application, all became considerably
rich.</p>

<p>"In the mean time, you see, old age knocks loudly at
my door, covers my head with snow, furrows my face, and warns
me that my healthful days are not of long duration. Once more,
therefore, I determined, before this feeble lamp of life was quite
extinguished, to revisit that favourite spot of ground, more dear to
me than even my native country, that <i>Lycia</i>, where I studied to be
wise and virtuous, under the kind guidance of my good old master.
In my passage thither, I was credibly informed by a merchant of
the <i>Cyclad Islands</i>, that one of <i>Orchilochus</i>'s sons still lived at <i>Delos</i>;
and practised all the virtues of his god-like grandsire. Whereupon
I immediately declined my intended voyage; and under the protection 
of the <i>Delian</i> God, arrived in safety on this happy Island, in
hopes to find the dear remains of one, to whom I owe my life,
my liberty, my all. </p>

<p>"My days are almost now spun out to their full

<!-- page 6 -->

length: the cruel <i>Parc&aelig;</i>, foes to that downy rest which <i>Jove</i> bestows
so seldom upon mortals, will quickly cut the feeble thread!
O! could these eyes but once behold the grandson of my dear, dear
master, freely I'd press into Death's icy arms! Speak then, O speak,
my hospitable friend, have you ever heard of such a virtuous youth?
Can you direct me where to find him? If you can, may the kind
Gods reward you for the favour! May they prolong your happy life,
till your children's children dance upon your knees, and ask
your blessing! May peace and plenty, the best fruits of virtue, ever
attend your numerous progeny!" </p>

<p>At the close of this kind prayer of
ARISTON&Ouml;US, tears, shed from joy and grief, like kindly showers,
flowed down SOPHRONYMUS'S cheeks. His transport stopped the
organs of his speech; silent, he threw his arms around the old
man's neck, embraced, and pressed him close: but at the last, words
intermingled with sighs found out their way.</p>

<p>"O! venerable Sir,
I am the youth you look for;&mdash;I am the grandson of your friend
<i>Alcinus</i>: and from the recital of your wonderous story, am persuaded,
fully persuaded, that Heaven has sent you here to mitigate 
my sorrows. Gratitude, which long since&mdash;like <i>Astr&aelig;a</i>&mdash;had
forsook the world, is now returned in you. I had heard, indeed,
when but a child, that a gentleman of fortune and distinguished
merit, who lived in <i>Lycaonia</i>, had been educated by my grand-father: 
but as my father <i>Orchilochus</i> died young, when I was a poor,
helpless infant, you may imagine my ideas of those things were but
confused. I was loth, on such weak motives, to go to <i>Lycaonia</i>;
I chose rather to continue here in quiet, alleviating my sorrows
by a philosophical contempt of grandeur and magnificence, and an
agreeable cultivation of the muses in the temple of <i>Apollo</i>. <i>Minerva</i>, 
who instructs mankind, that nature is sufficed with but a
little, and that true happiness consists in a contented mind, has
hitherto supported me, and amply made amends for all my losses."</p>

<!-- page 7 -->

<p>SOPHRONYMUS, soon as he had spoke these words, finding himself
before the temple-gate, proposed to ARISTON&Ouml;US to enter in,
and offer up their mutual prayers and praises to the <i>Delian</i> God.
The proposal was approved; with awful reverence two lambs,
white as the new-fallen snow, and a young heifer, with a crescent
on his forehead, just between his horns, were laid upon the altar.
There they hailed the God of Day; there in melodious numbers
praised the sun, who, in his radiant orb, illumines heaven and
earth; who rolls around the year, makes all the arts and sciences
his care, and animates the sacred nine. Their homage to the God
thus paid, they spent the remnant of the day, alternately recounting
their adventures.</p>

<p>SOPHRONYMUS conducted to his house the good
old man, and entertained him with the same respect as he would
have shown <i>Alcinus</i>, had he then been living. The day following
both agreed to sail for <i>Lycia</i>. ARISTON&Ouml;US led his companion into
a fertile country, on the verdant borders of the river <i>Xanthus</i>, in
whose transparent streams <i>Apollo</i>, wearied with the chase, and covered
with dust, so frequently had plunged, and washed his golden locks.
Willows and poplars stood in rows along the river side, within
whose tender verdant boughs a thousand pretty birds concealed their
nests, and warbled night and day. The river, falling from the summit
of a rock, dashed down her noisy, foaming billows into a little
channel paved with pebbles. A golden harvest covered all the plain.
Fruit-trees and vines rose, like an amphitheatre, all round the little
hills. There lavish nature had adorned the year; clear was the
sky, serene the air, and the earth ready to produce her stores, with
gratitude to crown the labours of the swain.</p>

<p>As they advanced
still higher up the river, SOPHRONYMUS perceived a little country
seat, not gay, but regularly built. No marble pillars, no costly
figures, wrought in silver, gold, or ivory, adorned the outside; no
purple furniture was seen within. Every thing, however, was neat,

<!-- page 8 -->

clean, and convenient, though no ways ostentatious. In the middle
of the court, a little fountain played its waters high, which, as they
fell, formed a delightful rill, whose verdant banks were all enamelled 
with the gayest flowers. The gardens were but small, yet
plentifully stored with various fruits and salutary plants. On each
side of the garden was a pleasant grove, whose lofty trees seemed
coetaneous with their mother earth: whose branches were so
thick, so interwoven, that no sun-beams ever could pierce them.</p>

<p>They withdrew into a spacious parlour, and there refreshed themselves
with such repast, as nature from the gardens had provided;
wherein no costly foreign fruits were introduced, so often purchased,
and so much admired in cities. They had milk in plenty; sweeter
than that <i>Apollo</i>'s cattle yielded, when shepherd to <i>Admetus</i>. They
had honey more delicious than the product of the <i>Sicilian</i> Bees in
<i>Hybla</i>, or those of <i>Attica</i> on mount <i>Hymettus</i>. They had store of
beans and peas, and various fruits before them but that moment
gathered. Their wine, which was racked off from stately jars into
small, well-wrought bowls, was of a finer flavour, and more racy
than the nectar of the Gods. </p>

<p>ARISTON&Ouml;US, during this frugal,
but delightful entertainment, would not sit down at table. At first,
he made a thousand little excuses to conceal his modesty; but when
at last SOPHRONYMUS was too importunate, he owned the cause:
declared he could not make himself so free, and so familiar with
the grandson of <i>Alcinus</i>, behind whose chair he had so many years
attended in that very parlour.</p>

<p>"Here, Sir," said he, "my good old
master always dined; there he conversed with his familiar friends;
there followed all his innocent diversions. Hesiod and Homer were
his old companions here; and there, Sir, was his favourite bed-room."</p>

<p>In friendly recollection of these various circumstances his
tender heart began to melt, and tears ran trickling down his cheeks.
After their repast was over, he conducted SOPHRONYMUS into the

<!-- page 9 -->

adjacent meadows, to take a view of his large cattle, which ranged
at will and lowed along the river. Then they surveyed his numerous 
flocks, as they returned from their fat pastures. The little
wanton lambs played near the bleating ewes, whose udders swelled
with milk. They found no servants idle; all were industrious in
their several vocations: work seemed a pleasure for so good a master; 
one whom they loved so well; and one, who sweetened all
their labours.</p>

<p>ARISTON&Ouml;US having now shown SOPHRONYMUS his house, his
slaves, his herds, his flocks, and fertile meadows, thus addressed
him: "With transport I behold you now possessed of what your ancestors
enjoyed before you. Happy am I! thus to have power to
reinstate you on that very spot, where I so long had served the good
Alcinus. Enjoy in peace that which long since was his. Make
yourself happy, but be cautious; and by your prudent conduct, may
your decline of life be replete with better fortune than marked
your venerable father's latter days."</p>

<p>Immediately he made the
estate over to SOPHRONYMUS by a legal conveyance; and declared
he would disinherit such of his relations, as should ungratefully
presume to dispute his title. ARISTON&Ouml;US had still further favours
to bestow. Before this deed of gift was executed, he furnished
the house anew; made it at all points decent and complete; without
things gaudy and superfluous. The barns he stored with the rich
treasures of the Goddess <i>Ceres</i>; the cellars with the choicest wines of
<i>Chios</i>, neat and racy, fit to be served up at <i>Jove</i>'s table by <i>Ganymede</i>
or <i>Hebe</i>. To these he added choice <i>Parmenian</i> wines, the honey of
<i>Hymettus</i> and of <i>Hybla</i>, in large quantities; and <i>Attic</i> oils almost
as sweet, and of as fine a flavour. Moreover, he heaped up a
boundless stock of the finest wool, white as unsullied snow, the
treasures formerly of tender sheep that fed on the <i>Arcadian</i> mountains 
and Sicilian plains. With these valuable additions was the
house made over to SOPHRONYMUS. He closed his bounty with a

<!-- page 10 -->

specific legacy of fifty <i>Euboic</i> talents, reserving to his own relations
his several estates in <i>Clazomene</i>, <i>Smyrna</i>, <i>Lebedos</i>, and <i> Colophon</i>;
all of considerable value.</p>

<p>ARISTON&Ouml;US having thus settled his affairs 
to his entire satisfaction, re-embarked on board his vessel, bound
for <i>Ionia</i>. SOPHRONYMUS overwhelmed with such a flood of favors,
waited on him to the ship; and as the tears ran trickling down
his cheeks, with filial tenderness caressed him, and called him as
they went along, his father. The winds proved favourable, and
ARISTON&Ouml;US soon arrived safe at home.</p>

<p>None of his relations ever
presumed to murmur at his bounty to SOPHRONYMUS. "My friends,"
said he, "I have now made my will; and thereby have declared, that
all my effects, real and personal, without restriction, shall be sold,
and given to the poor <i>Ionians</i>; in case any one of you hereafter shall
dispute my free donation to the grandson of <i>Alcinus</i>."</p>

<p>The good old
man long lived in peace; long he enjoyed the good things of this
life, which the kind Gods bestowed as the rewards of virtue. His
age did not prevent him, once a year, from visiting SOPHRONYMUS
at <i>Lycia</i>, and sacrificing on the tomb of good <i>Alcinus</i>, which he had
decorated with new erections, and most curious carved work.&mdash;He
by his will directed, that his body, after his decease, should be
interred in the same tomb, that even in death he might embrace
his master. SOPHRONYMUS, as each revolving spring came on,
impatient to behold his friend, forever fixed his eyes upon the shore,
in hopes to spy the bark, which at that season brought his dear
ARISTON&Ouml;US to his arms. Each year he had the pleasure to descry
from far the wished-for vessel, ploughing the briny waves, and
moving towards him. The distant prospect pleased him infinitely
more than all the beauties which the spring can boast of, when the
winter's rage abates.</p>

<p>This so much longed-for ship one spring never came at all. SOPHRONYMUS 
sighed from his inward soul. His secret anguish and
distracting fears were legible upon his face.&mdash;Soft, downy sleep

<!-- page 11 -->

never closed his weary eye-lids. He had no relish for the most costly
dainties. Restless he spent the tedious hours; each little noise
alarmed him: his eyes were ever wandering towards the port, and
he would every moment ask after the <i>Ionian</i> vessels.&mdash;One comes at
last:&mdash;but oh!&mdash;no ARISTON&Ouml;US was there.&mdash;Only his venerable
ashes in a silver urn. <i>Amphicles</i>, an old gentleman, and bosom-friend
of the deceased, his faithful executor, was the sole melancholy
bearer.&mdash;When he first approached, SOPHRONYMUS had no words
to tell his grief:&mdash;Both mingled sighs in a dumb scene of sorrow.
SOPHRONYMUS first kissed the urn, then bathed it with his tears;&mdash;words&mdash;at 
last found out their way.</p>

<p>"O thou venerable, good
old man!&mdash;All the pleasures I ever enjoyed flowed from thy bounty:
now all my joy, my comfort, all that is left in life fleets after thee.
These eyes shall never see thee more; death now would be thrice
welcome, could I but fly to thee, attend thee in the <i>Elysian</i> fields,
where thy blessed shade enjoys eternal rest: and such pleasures as the
Gods reserve for virtuous men. Thou hast brought back again, in
these degenerate times, religion, justice and gratitude on earth. In
these iron days, thou hast displayed the innocence and beauties of
the golden age. The Gods, before they crowned thee with the
glories of the just, granted thee length of happy days. But, alas!
he, who deserves to be immortal, often dies the soonest. Thy verdant 
fields, thy flowery gardens, now have no charms for me; now
thou art absent, every place, seems desert; O blessed shade! when
shall I follow thee? ye dear remains! had you sensation, you would
surely feel new pleasure in mingling with the ashes of <i>Alcinus</i>. Mine
shall one day be mingled too with yours. till that day comes, I
shall with pious care lock up thy precious ashes. O! ARISTON&Ouml;US! 
ARISTON&Ouml;US! thou shalt never die: thy memory shall ever
be imprinted on my heart. Sooner would I forget myself than
such a friend, so virtuous a man, so bountiful a benefactor!"</p>

<p>After this affectionate, though broken speech, SOPHRONYMUS performed 
the funeral rites, and placed the urn within his grandsire's

<!-- page 12 -->

monument. He sacrificed whole hecatombs, whose blood ran like a
torrent over the green-swerd altars, which were raised all round the
tomb. He poured forth large libations both of wine and milk.
He burnt perfumes imported from the distant east, whose odoriferous 
clouds curled upwards to the skies. Forever after, by the
appointment of SOPHRONYMUS, annual funeral games were celebrated 
in remembrance of <i>Alcinus</i>, and his virtuous friend. Spectators, 
in tribes innumerous, resorted thither from the fruitful
plains of <i>Caria</i>; from the delightful banks of the <i>Meander</i>, which
sports and plays along in many a winding wreath, and seems to quit
the country, which it waters, with reluctance; from the gay,
flowery banks of the <i>Caystra</i>; from the shores of rich <i>Pactolus</i>,
under whose gentle waves roll golden sands; and from <i>Pamphylia</i>,
to which <i>Pomona</i>, <i>Ceres</i> and <i>Flora</i> strive who shall be most indulgent; 
in fine, from the extended plains of fair <i>Cilicia</i>, as a garden
watered with the torrent rolling impetuous down from <i>Taurus</i>,
whose high head is ever silvered over with snow. During these annual 
rites, the nymphs and swains, dressed in loose linen robes,
white as the fairest lilies, sang the eulogiums of <i>Alcinus</i> and his
friend: there was no praising the one without the other; nor could
they separate two men, whose union still cemented in the grave.</p>

<p>A miracle immediately succeeded: on the first day of celebration,
whilst SOPHRONYMUS was pouring forth his large libations both
of wine and milk, a myrtle of fragrant smell, and beauteous verdure
shot from the middle of the tomb; all on a sudden, reared its tufted
head, and with its interwoven boughs overshadowed both the urns.
The whole assembly, with one voice, declared that ARISTON&Ouml;US, as
a reward of his uncommon virtues, was by the Gods transformed
into this beauteous tree. SOPHRONYMUS, with pious care, watered
this myrtle himself; revered it as a God. It seemed to flourish in
immortal youth; and, by this miracle, the Gods instructed them
that <i>Virtue, which diffuses such perfumes upon the memories of men is
everlasting, and its own reward</i>.</p>

<h3>FABLE II.</h3>

<h3>The ADVENTURES of MELESICHTON.</h3>

</div>

<p>MELESICHTON was a native of <i>Megaris</i>, and a gentleman of
an illustrious family in <i>Greece</i>. When young, the heroic
actions of his ancestors took up all his thoughts; and he gave early
demonstrations of his courage and conduct, in several bold and hazardous 
engagements: but as he was too fond of grandeur, his
high and expensive way of living soon plunged him into a sea of
troubles. He was obliged to fly with his wife PROXIN&Ouml;E to a
country-seat on the sea-shore, where they lived together in a profound 
solitude.</p>

<p>PROXIN&Ouml;E was a lady highly esteemed for her wit,
courage, and stately deportment: many, who were in much better
circumstances than MELESICHTON, made their addresses to her on
account of her birth and beauty; but true merit alone made him
the object of her choice. Though their virtue and friendship were
inviolable, though <i>Hymen</i> for many years had never united a happier
pair; yet their mutual attachment and affection proved now but
an aggravation of their sorrows. MELESICHTON could have borne
with less impatience the severest frowns of fortune, had he suffered
alone, or without so tender a partner as PROXIN&Ouml;E; and PROXIN&Ouml;E
with concern observed, that her presence augmented the pains of her
MELESICHTON. Their sole comfort now arose from the reflection
that heaven had blessed them with two children, beauteous as the
Graces: their son's name was <i>Meliboeus</i>, and the daughter's <i>Po&euml;minis</i>.</p>

<!-- page 14 -->

<p><i>Meliboeus</i> was very active, strong, and courageous; in every gentleman-like 
exercise he excelled all the neighbouring youth. He
ranged around the forests, and his arrows were as fatal and unerring
as those of Apollo: however, the arts and sciences&mdash;those nobler
rays of the deity&mdash;were more the objects of his contemplation,
than his bow was his diversion. MELESICHTON, in his retirement,
laid before him all the advantages of a liberal education, and imprinted 
on his mind, betimes, the love of virtue and good manners.
<i>Meliboeus</i>, in his air and mien, was unaffected, soft and engaging;
yet his aspect was noble, bold, and commanded respect. His father
cast his longing eyes upon him, and wept over him with a paternal
fondness.</p> 

<p>PO&Euml;MINIS was by the mother instructed with equal care,
in all the various arts with which the Goddess Minerva has obliged
mankind; and to those useful accomplishments were added the
charms of music: <i>Orpheus</i> never sung, or touched his lyre more
softly than <i>Po&euml;minis</i>. At first sight she appeared like the young
Goddess <i>Diana</i>, just risen from her native floating Island. Her
silver tresses were tied with a careless air behind; whilst some few
ringlets unconfined, played about her ivory neck at the breath of
every gentle zephyr. Her dress was a thin loose gown, tucked up
with a girdle, that she might move with the greater freedom.
Without the advantage of dress, no nymph was ever so beautiful,
so free from pride, so little conscious of her own charms. She was
never so vain or curious as to examine her features in any transparent
stream. The conduct and economy of the family was her whole
employment.</p>

<p>But MELESICHTON, whose thoughts were ever dark
and gloomy, whose hopes of a return from his state of banishment
were now all lost, sought every opportunity to be alone. The sight
of PROXIN&Ouml;E and his children now aggravated his sorrows: he
would often steal out to the sea-shore at the foot of a large rock,
full of tremendous caverns; and there awhile bemoan his wayward

<!-- page 15 -->

fate: from thence repair to a thick shady vale, where&mdash;even at
mid-day&mdash;no sun-beam ever entered. There would he sit on the
margin of a purling stream, and ruminate on all his ills. Soft,
downy sleep never closed his weary eye-lids; his words all terminated
in sighs; old age before his time had furrowed all his face; and
unable to bear the storm, he grew negligent of life, and sunk under
the weight of his misfortunes.</p>

<p>One day as he was reclined on a bank in his favourite, solitary
vale, tired and fatigued with thought, he fell asleep; and in a dream,
saw the Goddess <i>Ceres</i>, crowned with golden sheaves, who approached
him with an air of majesty and sweetness:&mdash;"Why, MELESICHTON," 
said she, "art thou thus inconsolable? Why art thou thus
overwhelmed with thy fate?"</p>

<p>"Alas!" replied he, "I am abandoned 
by my friends; my estate lost; law-suits and my creditors
forever perplex me; the thoughts of my birth, and the figure
I have made in the world are all aggravations of my misery; and
to labor at the oar, like a galley-slave, for a bare subsistence, is
an act too mean, and what my spirit never can comply with."</p>

<p>"Does nobility then," replied the Goddess, "consist in affluence
of fortune?&mdash;No, MELESICHTON; but in the heroic imitation
of thy virtuous ancestors. The just man only is truly noble.
Nature is sufficed with a little: enjoy that little with the sweat
of thy brow: live free from dependance, and no man will be
nobler than thyself.&mdash;Luxury and false ambition are the ruin of
mankind.&mdash;If thou art destitute of the conveniences of life, who
should better supply thee than thyself? Be not terrified then at
the thought of attaining them by the severest industry and application!"</p>

<p>She said; and immediately presented him with a golden ploughshare,
and an horn of plenty. <i>Bacchus</i> next appeared, crowned
with ivy, grasping his thyrsus in his hand, attended by <i>Pan</i>, playing

<!-- page 16 -->

on his rural pipe, while the fauns and satyrs danced to the melodious 
music. <i>Pomona</i> next advanced, laden with fruits, and <i>Flora</i>,
dressed in all her gayest, sweetest flowers. In short, all the rural
deities cast a favourable eye on MELESICHTON.</p>

<p>He waked, fully convinced of the application and moral use he
ought to make of this celestial dream. A dawn of comfort all on
a sudden shot through his soul, and he found new inclinations rise to
the labours of the plain. He communicated his dream with pleasure 
to the fair PROXIN&Ouml;E, who rejoiced with him, and approved of
his interpretation. The next day they lessened their retinue; the
valet and waiting-woman were immediately discharged, and all their
equipage and grandeur at once resigned. PROXIN&Ouml;E with <i>Po&euml;minis</i>
spun, while MELESICHTON and <i>Meliboeus</i> tended their sheep,&mdash;and 
at convenient hours weaved their own cloth and stuffs, and cut
out and contrived every thing to the best advantage for themselves
and the rest of the family. All their fine needle-works&mdash;in which
<i>Minerva</i> herself could never be more curious&mdash;were now no more
regarded; and the glaring tent was resigned for the mere advantageous 
distaff: their daily provisions were the product of their own
ground, and dressed with their own hands. They milked their own
kine, which now began to supply them with plenty. They purchased
nothing without doors. Every thing was got ready with
decency and without hurry. Their food was substantial, plain,
and natural; and enjoyed with that true relish, which is inseparable
from temperance and hard labour.</p>

<p>In this rural manner they lived, and every thing was neat and
decent round about them; all the costly tapestry was disposed of;
yet the walls were perfectly white; no part of the house in the least
disorder: none of the goods soiled with dust. The beds, though not
of down, were clean, and proper for repose. The very furniture
of the kitchen&mdash;which you shall seldom find in great families&mdash;was

<!-- page 17 -->

bright as silver; nothing stood out of its proper place. At
times of public entertainment PROXIN&Ouml;E made the best of pastry.
She kept bees, whose honey was sweeter than that which trickled
from the trunks of oaks that grew in the golden age. Her cows
made her willing presents of large flowing bowls of milk. Her
garden was plentifully stored with variety of plants for service and
delight, in their proper season; and by her peculiar industry and
skill, she was the first of all her neighbours that could produce them
in perfection: her collection of flowers likewise was very curious;
part of which she sold, after she had reserved a sufficient quantity
for the ornament of her house. <i>Po&euml;minis</i> trod in the steps of her
industrious mother; she was ever cheerful at her work, and sang as
she went along to pen her sheep. No neighbour's flock could rival
hers; no contagious distemper, no ravenous wolves durst ever approach 
them; her tender lambkins dance upon the plains to her
melodious notes, whilst all the echoes round about with pleasure repeat 
the dying sounds.</p>

<p>MELESICHTON tilled his own grounds, drove his own plough,
sowed his seed, and reaped his harvest with his own hand. He is
now fully convinced, that the husbandman's life is less laborious, far
more innocent and advantageous than the soldier's. No sooner had
he cocked and got in his hay; but <i>Ceres</i>, with her yellow fruits,
invited him to the field, and with large interest repaid the debt she
owed him. Soon after <i>Bacchus</i> supplied him with nectar, worthy
the table of the Gods. <i>Minerva</i> too complimented him with the
fruit of her favourite, salutary tree. Winter was the season for repose,
when all the family met together were innocently gay, and
thankful to the Gods, for all their harmless unambitious pleasures:
they ate no flesh, but at their sacrifices, and their cattle never died
but on their altars.</p>

<p><i>Meliboeus</i> was thoughtful and sedate beyond his years. He took
on himself the whole care and management of the larger cattle;
hewed down large oaks in the forests; dug aqueducts for the more
commodious watering the meadows, and with indefatigable industry

<!-- page 18 -->

would ease his father. His diversions, at proper seasons, were hunting 
and coursing with the young gentlemen, his neighbours; or improving 
himself in his studies, of which MELESICHTON had laid the
solid foundation.</p>

<p>In a little time, MELESICHTON, by a life thus led in simplicity
and innocence, was in better circumstances than at first; his house
was stored with all the conveniences of life; though there was nothing
in it useless, or superfluous. The company he kept, for the most
part, was within the compass of his own family: they lived together 
in perfect love and harmony, and contributed to each other's
happiness. Their humble residence was far from court, where pleasures 
bear so high a price; their enjoyments were sweet, innocent,
easy to be attained, and attended with no dangers in the pursuit.
<i>Meliboeus</i> and <i>Po&euml;minis</i> were thus brought up, and inured to rural
labours: thus their former characters served only to inspire them
with greater courage, and make them easy under the frowns of fortune. 
The increase of their flock introduced no new and luxurious
course of life. Their diet was still as frugal as before, and their industry 
continued with equal vigour.</p>

<p>MELESICHTON'S friends now
pressed him&mdash;since fortune once again had proved propitious&mdash;to resume
his former post, and shine again in the busy world. To whom
he replied: "Shall I again give way to pride and luxury, the fatal
cause of all my late misfortunes; or shall I spend my future days in
rural labours, which have not only made me rich again, but what
is more, completely happy?"&mdash;To conclude,&mdash;one day he took a
tour to his old solitary shade, where <i>Ceres</i> had thus kindly directed
his conduct in a dream, and reposed himself on the verdant grass,
with as much serenity of mind, as before with confusion and despair.
There he slept again; again the Goddess <i>Ceres</i>, in the like gracious
manner, approached, and thus addressed him. "True nobility,
MELESICHTON, consists in receiving no favours from any one,
and bestowing them with a liberal hand on all.&mdash;Have your dependance 
on nothing but the fruitful bosom of the earth, and the works
of your own hands. Never for luxury and empty show resign that
solid good which is the natural, and inexhaustible fountain of true
happiness."</p>

<h3>ARIST&AElig;US and VIRGIL.</h3>

</div>

<p>VIRGIL, soon after his descent to the infernal regions, came to
the <i>Elysian</i> fields; where the favourites of the Gods lived in
perpetual bliss, on banks of never-dying flowers, amidst a thousand
little purling streams. The shepherd ARIST&AElig;US, who was sitting 
amongst the Demi-gods, understanding who he was, immediately 
approached, and thus addressed him. "The sight of so divine a
Poet as you are, is pleasure inexpressible. Your verses, sire, flow
softer than the dew upon the tender grass; so sweet, so harmonious
are your numbers, they command our tears, and melt our hearts.
Your tuneful songs on me, and my bees, might make e'en <i>Homer</i>
jealous. To you I stand as much indebted for the honours that are
paid me, as to the sun and to <i>Cyrene</i>. Not long ago I rehearsed some
beautiful passages of yours to <i>Linus</i>, <i>Homer</i>, and <i>Hesiod</i>. No sooner
had I finished, but all three drank large draughts of the river <i>Lethe</i>
to forget them; so painful was the recollection of another's verses,
sweet as their own. The whole tribe of Poets, you know, are extremely 
jealous. Come, therefore, amongst them, and take possession
of your place."</p>

<p>"Since they are so partially jealous, as you observe&mdash;" replied 
VIRGIL&mdash;"I shall not be over-delighted with the place. I must
spend many a tedious hour in such company; for I perceive, like your
bees, they presently grow warm, and show their resentment."</p>

<p>" 'Tis true,"
replied ARIST&AElig;US, "like bees, they buzz, and like them too have their
stings, and seek revenge on all that dare provoke them."</p>

<p>"There's another 
great man, I see," says VIRGIL, "that I must endeavour to oblige
too, the divine <i>Orpheus</i>, I mean;&mdash;pray do you live socially together?"</p>

<p>"I 
cannot say we do," replied ARIST&AElig;US; "for he's as jealous of his wife,
as the other three are of their compositions. But you need not fear

<!-- page 20 -->

a civil reception there; for you have used him with abundance of
good manners, and have been much more prudent, much more favourable 
than <i>Ovid</i>, in your relation of his quarrel with the <i>Thracian</i>
dames, to whose resentment he fell an unhappy victim. But we lose
time; let us enter this little sacred grotto, watered with so many
fountains, clearer than the crystal. Believe me, the whole sacred
band will rise, and pay their due respects to you.</p>

<p>"Don't you already
hear <i>Orpheus</i>'s tuneful lyre? and <i>Linus</i>, who sings the combat of the
Gods against the giants? Don't you hear <i>Homer</i> too, ringing the heroic 
actions of the great <i>Achilles</i>; who slew the mighty <i>Hector</i>, to
revenge the fall of his friend <i>Patroclus?</i> But <i>Hesiod</i> is the Poet, whose
displeasure you have most reason to dread; for one of his sanguine
complexion will be apt to take distaste at your admirable Treatise on
Agriculture, which he imagines his peculiar province."</p>

<p>ARIST&AElig;US had no sooner finished his address, but they arrived at
the refreshing shades, where an eternal transport reigns, which inspires
these mighty heroes. All rose, and intreated VIRGIL to sit
down, and repeat some of his favourite verses. At first he sang
low, with a becoming modesty; but at last, grew bolder, and spoke
with energy and transport. The most jealous of them all, even
against their inclinations, were ravished at the music of his voice.
<i>Orpheus</i>'s lyre, that had so often charmed the very rocks and woods,
now dropped out of his hand, and bitter tears flowed down his cheeks.
<i>Homer</i> forgot the inimitable majesty of his Iliad, and the beauteous
variety of his Odyssey. <i>Linus</i> mistook his flowing verses for the
composition of his father <i>Apollo</i>, and at the ravishing sounds stood
speechless, and as immoveable as a statue. <i>Hesiod</i> himself could not
resist such powerful charms. At last, recollecting himself a little,
he with much warmth and jealousy thus addressed him. "O VIRGIL,
thy works are more durable than monuments of brass or marble! Yet
still I prophesy the day will come, when a royal youth shall translate
them into his native language, and shall share the honour with thee
of having sung the conduct and economy of the bees."</p>

<h3>FABLE IV.</h3>

<h3>The STORY of ALIBEG the PERSIAN.</h3>

</div>

<p>CHA-ABBAS, King of Persia, under pretense of taking a tour,
retired from court into the country, and concealed himself
under the character of a private gentleman, in order to take an unsuspected
survey of his subjects in all their native innocence and
freedom. One favourite courtier alone had the honour to attend
him in his travels.</p>

<p>"I have no right idea," says the monarch to
his companion, "of the simple, undisguised manners of mankind.
Courtiers act all in masquerade. Crowned heads see nothing of
nature: every transaction is artifice and design. I have a great
inclination to pry into the secret pleasures of a country life, and
examine that part of my subjects, who live retired, and neglected
by the busy world, and yet are in reality the props of my crown
and constitution. 'Tis a pain inexpressible to have none but sycophants 
about me, who embrace every opportunity, by their
fulsome flatteries, if possible, to betray me. My resolution, therefore,
is fixed to visit the shepherds, and other fellow-labourers of the
plains, to whom I shall be a perfect stranger."</p>

<p>Thus determined,
he and his companion past through several villages, where the nymphs
and swains were assembled, to spend the day in rural sports; and
his majesty was extremely pleased to find such agreeable diversions,
so remote from court, so innocent and inexpensive. He dined in
one of their cottages, and having walked something farther than

<!-- page 22 -->

usual, and created himself an appetite, their coarse country diet
proved a more agreeable entertainment than the vast variety of costly
dainties at his own table.</p>

<p>As he was walking over a meadow,
enamelled with a thousand various flowers, and watered with a clear,
murmuring stream, he spied a young, gay swain, reclined at the foot
of a shady elm, and playing on his rural pipe, whilst his tender
flock stood grazing round him, and listened to his soft melodious
notes. The monarch approached, looked earnestly at him, and
was pleased with his agreeable aspect, his easy, unaffected air,
which yet was graceful and majestic. His shepherd's dress added
new charms to his beauty. The King, at first, fancied he was some
discontented courtier in disguise; nor was convinced of his error,
till the shepherd told him his name was ALIBEG, and that all his
relations lived in the adjacent village.</p>

<p>Whilst his majesty proposed
to him several questions, he was exceedingly delighted with his pertinent 
and ready solutions. ALIBEG'S eyes were lively and sparkling; 
but not in the least wild or roving: his voice soft, engaging
and musical. His features were small and beautiful; but not soft
and effeminate. though sixteen years of age, he had no idea of his
own superior perfections. He imagined all his neighbours thought
and talked as he did; and that nature had been as indulgent to
them in their formation, as to himself.&mdash;Without the advantages
of a liberal education, he directed his conduct by the dictates of
right reason.</p>

<p>The King, after some few familiarities, was charmed
with his conversation. ALIBEG gave him a true and impartial account 
of the state and constitution of the people; a secret, Kings
can never learn amidst a crowd of flatterers. Now and then his
majesty would smile at ALIBEG'S expressions, which were so natural, 
so open and unguarded. It was an agreeable novelty to the
King to hear such free, such unstudied discourses. The monarch
beckoned to his friend, and gave him private intimations not to

<!-- page 23 -->

discover who he was, lest ALIBEG, apprized of such a secret, should
be over-awed, and talk for the future with more reserve; and so at
once lose all the beauties which freedom naturally gives to conversation.</p>

<p>"I am now fully convinced," said his majesty to his companion,
"that nature appears as beautiful in the cottage as the palace. No
heir apparent to the crown seems nobler born than this youth,
who thus daily tends his harmless flock. How happy should
CHA-ABBAS be, had he a son, so beautiful, so prudent, and so much
the object of love and admiration! In my opinion, he may be qualified 
for the highest employments, and with proper instruction may
become an able minister of state. I'll take him home with me, and
give him a liberal education."</p> 

<p>The King accordingly at his return
took ALIBEG with him, as a new attendant,&mdash;ALIBEG was agreeably 
surprised to find his conversation had proved so acceptable to a
monarch. Soon after their arrival, proper masters were appointed,
first to instruct him in reading, writing, singing and dancing; and
afterwards, in the severer studies of the arts and sciences, which
cultivate the mind. At first, the grandeur of a court made too
deep an impression on his heart, and his constitution varied with his
advancement. His youth and reputation at court gave a new turn
to his judgment and moderation. He flung away his crook, his
pipe, and shepherd's weeds, and dressed himself in a purple vest richly
embroidered with gold; he wore likewise a turban on his head,
set round with costly jewels. The most beautiful, the gayest courtier, 
served only as a foil to ALIBEG. By industry and application
he qualified himself for the most important undertakings, and well
deserved the trust his master reposed in him; who, sensible of
ALIBEG'S refined taste for grandeur, and magnificence, made him
his jewel-keeper, or treasurer of his most costly furniture; one of
the most considerable posts in all <i>Persia</i>.</p>

<p>During the whole reign of CHA-ABBAS, ALIBEG was a rising

<!-- page 24 -->

favourite: but as he grew in years, he grew less gay, and often reflected 
with regret on his former happy state of life. "Happy
days!" he would often whisper to himself, "O days of innocence!
Then were all my enjoyments chaste, attended with no dangers
in the pursuit! I never did, nor ever shall see days so blessed again.
His majesty, by his royal bounty and munificence, has but undone
me." ALIBEG once more paid a visit to his native village; once
more observed with curious eye, as he passed along, where formerly
he danced and sang, and piped with his brother swains. He made
several valuable presents to his friends and relations round about;
but advised them, as they regarded their future welfare, to shun the
dangers that attend ambition, and spend their happy days in ease
and innocence.</p>

<p>ALIBEG, soon after the death of his indulgent master CHA-ABBAS,
was plunged in a sea of troubles. CHA-SEFI succeeded his
father in the throne of <i>Persia</i>. Some jealous, designing courtiers
projected the downfall of ALIBEG, and agreed to misrepresent him
to the young monarch. They charged him as guilty of high crimes
and misdemeanors; with being false to the trust reposed in him by
the late King; with clandestinely disposing of several rich moveables
in the treasury, and applying the same to his own private use.
CHA-SEFI, ascending the throne of his father very young, was
perfectly credulous, regardless of right or wrong, and a prince of
but small penetration. However, he was so vain as to imagine his
wisdom superior to his predecessors, and that he could reform the
state.</p>

<p>In order to remove ALIBEG from his post with some colour
of justice&mdash;pursuant to the advice of his envious council&mdash;he required 
him to produce forthwith the scimitar, set round with
costly jewels, which his warlike grandsire always wore in the field
of battle. CHA-ABBAS had formerly ordered all those jewels to be
removed; and ALIBEG brought indisputable proof of his innocence,

<!-- page 25 -->

and of their being disposed of, in obedience to the absolute commands 
of his father, long before he had the honour of that important 
trust. When ALIBEG'S enemies found this scheme to ruin
him proved ineffectual, they prevailed on CHA-SEFI to oblige him
to produce an exact inventory of all the valuable furniture in the
treasury then in his custody, within sixteen days, on pain of displeasure.</p>

<p>Accordingly he did; and at the expiration of the term CHA-SEFI 
was so curious as to examine every individual article himself.
ALIBEG opened every closet and cabinet, and concealed nothing that
was committed to his care. There was no one item missing; the
office was every where clean, and in perfect order, and the regalia
closely locked up in their proper repositories. The young King
surprised to find his treasury managed with such good conduct and
economy, had entertained a very favourable opinion of ALIBEG,
but that accidentally he observed&mdash;at the end of a long gallery,
full of the richest furniture&mdash;a private iron-door, on which were
three substantial locks.</p>

<p>"There, Sir," said ALIBEG'S accusers, whispering
him in the ear; "there you'll find the royal plunder."</p> 

<p>CHA-SEFI 
enraged, and looking sternly on ALIBEG, cried aloud, "This
moment will I see what is within these doors.&mdash;What have you
concealed there?&mdash;I charge you show me."</p>

<p>ALIBEG fell prostrate
at the King's feet, and implored his majesty, in the awful name of
the Gods, not to deprive him of all he valued upon earth.&mdash;"O!
think! how unreasonable it is&mdash;" says he&mdash;"at once to seize my last
reserve for old age, after having served your royal father faithfully
so many years. Leave me but that; all that I have besides, I willingly 
resign."</p>

<p>CHA-SEFI now was fully convinced that ALIBEG
was guilty; and that there lay concealed the royal treasure. Now
more angry than before, and in louder terms, he demands the doors
to be unlocked. At last ALIBEG produced the keys, and smiling,
obeyed his orders. Upon examination, nothing was found but
ALIBEG'S crook, his pipe, and the dress he wore before his advancement, 

<!-- page 26 -->

which he frequently surveyed with pleasure, to remind him of
his first state of innocence.</p>

<p>"Behold!" said he, "O King, there lie
the valuable remains of my former felicity. It is not in the power
of your majesty, or fortune herself to take them from me. There,
royal Sir, is all the treasure I have reserved to make me rich,
when your displeasure shall sink me into poverty. The rest I give
you back without regret; leave your servant but the dear pledges
of his first happy station. These, royal Sir, are durable riches;
these never will deceive me. Riches! that are natural, innocent,
and forever grateful to the wise man that lives content with the
conveniences of life, and shuns the fatal charms of false ambition.
Riches! that are enjoyed without the loss of liberty, and free
from dangers. These never procured any man one moment's
disquiet. O! ye dear equipage of the plain, but happy man!
you only I admire; with you I'll live and die. O! why was I
charmed with golden prospects that have deceived me, and ruined
my content! Here, O King, I freely resign all the favours your
goodness has conferred upon me. I'll only reserve to myself what
I had, when first your father saw me, and by his boundless liberality 
undid me."</p> 

<p>The King, at the close of this address, was
fully convinced of ALIBEG'S innocence and good conduct; and so
far resented the villainy of his unjust and envious accusers, that
he banished them [from] his court. ALIBEG soon after was made prime
minister; and entrusted with the most important affairs of the state;
however, every day he still surveyed his rural equipage, and kept
them safe in his repository to be ready at a time of need, whenever
fickle fortune should again prove impropitious. He died in a good
old age, without gratifying his revenge on his enemies, though in his
power, and without laying up immense sums to enrich his posterity.
He left his relations but just sufficient to maintain themselves with
credit in the station of shepherds, a situation of all others, in his
opinion, most free from care, and most completely happy.</p>

<h3>FABLE V.</h3>

<h3>ROSIMUND AND BRAMINTES.</h3>

</div>

<p>IN ancient times, there was a youth, fair as the day, named ROSIMUND, 
whose virtue and good-humour were found equal to his
beauty; his elder brother BRAMINTES was his reverse, and as much
nature's disgrace, as ROSIMUND her master-piece. The younger
was the mother's darling; the elder her aversion. BRAMINTES,
jealous of her favours, invented a thousand lies, if possible to ruin
ROSIMUND. He told his father, that his brother had contracted an
inviolable friendship with a neighbour, who was his professed
enemy; that he revealed all the secrets of the family; and that they
two concerted measures by poison to destroy him.</p>

<p>The father,
alarmed at this impious accusation, treated ROSIMUND with the utmost
inhumanity; his cruelty extended even to blows that caused
the blood to gush at every vein; and then confined him to his
chamber for three days successively, without the least subsistence;
and at last, drove him headlong from his doors, with dreadful imprecations 
that he would murder him the moment he returned.
The mother, trembling at this strange severity, durst not interpose;
but sighed, and pitied his misfortunes. Poor ROSIMUND, thus
discarded, departs from home in a flood of tears; and knowing no
friend that would receive him, in the evening traverses a lonely
wood. When night came on, he found himself at the foot of a
large rock;&mdash;at the entrance of one of the caverns, he laid himself
down on a mossy bank, near which rolled gently a purling stream,

<!-- page 28 -->

and tired with thought, fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>Soon as the dawning
day appeared, he waked, and before his eyes&mdash;lo! a beauteous virgin 
stood&mdash;dressed like Diana,&mdash;mounted on a grey courser, whose
furniture was embroidered with gold. "Pray, shepherd," said she,
"have you seen stag or dogs pass by this way?"</p>

<p>"No, none at all&mdash;"
was his reply.</p>

<p>"Friend," said she, "you look disconsolate&mdash;tell me
your misfortunes freely.&mdash;Be comforted; behold! I here present
you with a ring, which, if you use with discretion, will make you
the most powerful, the most happy man on earth. Turn but the
diamond within your hand, and in a moment you'll be invisible.
Turn it but without, and you'll be visible again. When you fix it
on your little finger, you'll personate the King's son, attended by a
numerous train of courtiers. Remove it again to your next, and
you'll assume your proper shape."</p>

<p>The youth now understood that
his fair huntress was a fairy. Soon as she had thus revealed its secret
virtues, she struck into the grove. ROSIMUND resolves immediately 
to return home, and is impatient till he has made the experiment. 
He saw every transaction, and was privy to every secret,
without the least observance. though he could have gratified his revenge, 
without discovery, on his ungrateful brother; yet he only
chose to make himself known to his indulgent mother, with filial
affection to embrace her, and tell her his strange adventure. Soon
after this private interview, he put his magic ring on his little finger,
and in a moment personated the young prince, followed by an hundred 
horse-guards, and a numerous train of officers, all gayly
dressed. The father was confounded, to find his little cottage so
much honoured, and wholly at a loss how to behave himself on such
an unexpected visit.</p>

<p>"Pray," says ROSIMUND, "how many sons have
you friend?"</p>

<p>"Two, sir," replied the old man.</p>

<p>"Let me see them," says
ROSIMUND. "Call them to me this moment. I'll take them with
me to court, and advance them according to their merit."</p>

<p>The

<!-- page 29 -->

conscious father, with hesitation, replied; "This, sir, is my eldest,
with all submission, at your service." 

<p>"But where's your youngest?"
says ROSIMUND. "I must take him with me too."</p>

<p>"Sir," says the old
man, "the unlucky lad is not at home. I corrected him some time
ago for his undutiful behaviour, and have never seen him since."</p>

<p>"Severity," replied ROSIMUND, "is a false step in education. Let your
eldest son, however, follow me; go you, friend, along with my
guards, who have my orders to take care of you."</p>

<p>Two guards
immediately conveyed the old man away; and the same Fairy we
mentioned before, meeting him in a forest, struck him with her
golden wand, drove him into a gloomy cave, and there confined him
by her magic art. "Do penance there," said she, "till your injured
son shall think proper to release you."</p>

<p>In the mean time ROSIMUND
went to court, soon after the young prince had embarked with proper
forces for a distant island, in hopes by conquest to extend his father's
empire; but being drove by adverse winds upon an unknown coast,
his vessel bulged upon a rock, and he became the unhappy captive of
the barbarous inhabitants. ROSIMUND appeared at court, as the
King's son, whom all imagined to be buried in the bosom of the
ocean, and whose untimely loss was universally lamented. He pretended,
that he had inevitably perished, had not some friendly merchants 
took compassion on his misfortunes, and preserved him.
Joy sat on every face. The good old King folded his son, whom
he thought dead, within his eager arms, whilst transport stopped
the organs of his speech. The Queen received him with still softer
demonstrations of fondness and indulgence.&mdash;In short, the whole
kingdom was engaged in public rejoicings on this happy occasion.</p>

<p>One day, our imaginary prince thus bespoke his real brother.
"BRAMINTES, notwithstanding I have raised you from the cottage
to the palace; yet I know you base&mdash;ungenerous;&mdash;nay more, I
know that by malicious misrepresentations you have injured your

<!-- page 30 -->

brother. He is now incognito at court. You shall see him; and
he shall have an opportunity to show his just resentment."</p>

<p>BRAMINTES 
trembling with conscious guilt, threw himself at the Prince's
feet, and confessed his ingratitude.</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding this submission,
I charge you, speak to your brother, and in the humblest
manner solicit his pardon. 'Twill be an act of generosity in him
to grant it. You do not deserve so much indulgence. He is now
in my closet; you shall have an interview immediately. In the
mean time I'll withdraw to the next apartment, and leave you to
yourselves."</p>

<p>BRAMINTES, in compliance with the prince's positive
commands, attended in the closet. Immediately ROSIMUND reassumed
his shape, by virtue of his ring, and through a back door
waited on his brother, who stood speechless and confounded, when
he first saw him. But soon recollecting himself, begged his pardon,
with large promises of future love and friendship. ROSIMUND,
with tears, embraced and forgave him.</p>

<p>"I have the honour," says
he, "to be the prince's peculiar favourite. Your liberty, your life is
in my hands: but you shall find, though much you've wronged me,
I'll be a brother still."</p> 

<p>BRAMINTES, conscious of guilt, with downcast
eyes, and due submission, answered; but dared not claim the
title of relation. Soon after ROSIMUND pretended to withdraw
from court, and pay his addresses to a neighbouring princess; but his
secret intention was to visit his poor mother, to tell her minutely his
transactions, and to present her with a small purse of gold, to supply
her present occasions. For though the King's treasury was ever
open to his demands; yet he always used that boundless liberty,
with amazing prudence and moderation. </p>

<p>In the mean time the
old King proclaimed war against a neighbouring prince, on whose
honour there could be no dependance. ROSIMUND went to the
enemy's court, and by virtue of his magic ring, entered invisibly
into their most privy-councils. He improved all their schemes to

<!-- page 31 -->

his own advantage. He got the start of them, and broke all their
measures; commanded the army against them; gained a complete
victory over them; and soon after settled an honourable peace, on
the most advantageous terms.</p>

<p>The King now determines to make
a new alliance, by marrying his supposed victorious son, with a
princess, fair as the Graces, and heiress of a neighbouring kingdom.
But one day, ROSIMUND's guardian fairy, as he was hunting in the
forest, where first she met him, appeared to him a second time.</p>

<p>"Presume not, I charge you," says she&mdash;with a solemn tone&mdash;"to marry
this royal beauty, in your assumed character. To deceive is mean
and dishonourable. The prince, whom you personate, ought in
justice to fill in proper time his father's throne. Haste then, and
find him; he lies concealed in a far distant island: I'll be your guardian, 
and conduct your vessel safe to port. Bid adieu to all the vanity 
of false ambition: be proud to serve so good a master, and, like
an honest man, fit down contented with your private station. These
are my positive injunctions, and justice demands your obedience;
Your neglect will raise my resentment, and plunge you into all your
former troubles."</p> 

<p>ROSIMUND readily complied with her wise advice.
He embarked immediately, under colour of a private negotiation
with a neighbouring state, and the partial winds soon wafted his vessel
to the destined shore. Our young prince was there the captive of
the barbarous inhabitants, and employed to tend their cattle. The
invisible ROSIMUND soon found him in a distant meadow; and
throwing his cloak, as invisible as himself, over his shoulders, without 
the least observance, restored him to his native freedom. They
both set sail together. New winds, obedient to the fairy's call,
wafted them home. They soon arrived at the old King's apartment.</p>

<p>ROSIMUND introduced the royal captive, and thus addressed his
father. "Your majesty has hitherto imagined me to be your son;
yet now I hold myself obliged to undeceive you: from my hands
receive your royal heir."</p> 

<p>The King, greatly surprised, directed his
discourse to his real son. "Was it not you, my son, who lately

<!-- page 32 -->

triumphed over our foes, and settled such a glorious peace? Or hast
thou, tell me true, been ship-wrecked on some distant coast, been
taken by the savage brutes a captive, and dost thou owe thy life and
liberty to this gracious youth?"</p>

</p>"Yes, royal Sir, he generously came
where I was made a slave:&mdash;it was he redeemed me: To him I am
indebted for my restoration, and this happy meeting. To him, not
me, belongs the honour due to your victorious arms."</p>

<p>The King
would have remained incredulous to his son's assertion; but that
ROSIMUND, by a new disposition of his ring, assumed the prince
before him. The King was startled at the sudden metamorphosis,
and knew not which to call his son. Not long after, the King
would have loaded ROSIMUND with royal rewards for his distinguished
love and loyalty; all which he modestly refused, and only
requested that his brother BRAMINTES might still be honoured with
his favour.</p>

<p>As for himself, he was fearful of the inconstancy of fortune, 
the frowns of an ill-natured world, and too conscious of his
own demerits. He hoped, therefore, that his royal goodness would
permit him to retire to his own country cottage, and spend the remainder 
of his days with his indulgent mother, in innocence and
rural labours. The Fairy now met him a third time in the grove,
showed him the cavern where his father lay enchanted, and told him
the proper magic terms that would release him. With filial piety
he broke the charm. He waited with impatience for this opportunity 
of showing his duty, and putting it in his father's power to spend
his future days in peace and plenty.</p>

<p>ROSIMUND, in short, was a
generous benefactor to all his relations, and studied to do good for
evil. Thus after his signal services for his King and country, the
only favour that he requested, was the liberty to live retired, far
from the reigning vices of the court. ROSIMUND wisely feared
his magic gift might tempt him to resign his solitude, and make once
more a figure in the busy world. He returned therefore to his favourite 
wood, and daily visited the happy cave, where first he saw
his guardian-fairy, in hopes of the same honour once again. In a

<!-- page 33 -->

short time, she obliged him with her pretense; and he, with modesty,
returned her magic ring. "Here, madam," says he, "I thankfully 
restore you back your inestimable, though dangerous present&mdash;which, 
unless with prudence used, must soon prove fatal to its
owner. I durst not trust to my own conduct, whilst I have it in
my power to quit my rural innocence, and gratify at pleasure
lawless passions."</p>

<p>Whilst ROSIMUND was thus resigning all his grandeur, BRAMINTES, 
still as ungenerous, still as vicious as before, endeavoured,
by false insinuations to prevail on the young prince, now in possession
of his father's throne, to humble ROSIMUND. "Your brother&mdash;" says
the Fairy to ROSIMUND&mdash;"is incorrigible; he aims to bring your
past conduct into question, and undo you. No punishment is equal
to his demerits. His fate is sealed.&mdash;I'll go this moment, and give
him this ring, which you have resigned."</p>

<p>ROSIMUND, reflecting on
the fatal consequence&mdash;wept. Then, turning to the Fairy: "What
horrid punishment," said he, "will such a dangerous present be to him?
He will then rule absolute, and every honest man will fall a victim
to his power."</p>

<p>"Your remark is just&mdash;" replied the Fairy.&mdash;"The same
medicine may be applied with good effect to one constitution, that
will infallibly destroy another. The prosperity of the wicked is the
sure foundation of all their future miseries. The villain, flushed with
arbitrary power, like <i>Pha&euml;ton</i>, drives headlong to his ruin."</p>

<p>She vanished;
and in the form of an old tattered beggar, appeared at court,
when meeting the gay BRAMINTES, she thus addressed him. "The
ring, sir, which I gave your brother, and by which alone he raised
his fortune, is once again in my disposal. For you I have reserved
the valuable present; be cautious of the power it gives you."</p>

<p>BRAMINTES, smiling, replied; "My brother's conduct shall be no
rule to me; I never shall search, like him, through foreign climes,
to find an heir, when I can fill the throne myself."</p>

<p>BRAMINTES,
invested with this magic ring, pries into every private family's concerns, 
acts every day the traitor; betrays the councils of his master,
plunders his subjects, drinks deep of sensual pleasures, and makes even

<!-- page 34 -->

murder his diversion. His crimes, though invisible, startled all mankind.
The King could not imagine which way his secrets could be made
so public; but the pride and boundless profusion of BRAMINTES
gave room for suspicion that his brother's ring was now in his possession.</p>

<p>A foreigner, subject to a prince of an enemy nation, was employed, 
by high bribes, to make the discovery. This hireling went
accordingly to BRAMINTES one night, and made him an offer, in
the name of his master, of vast sums of money, and other demonstrations
of friendship, if he, by proper spies, would give him secret
intelligence of what past at court. BRAMINTES accepted of the
terms, and met at the place appointed; where he received a large
gratuity as an encouragement to pursue so important an undertaking.
Amongst other exaltations of his own merit, he made his boast of his
invisible ring. The next day, he was taken into custody by one of
the King's messengers. The ring, and several treasonable papers
were found upon him, which were undeniable evidences of his guilt.&mdash;ROSIMUND 
made all the interest at court he possibly could, to save
his life, but to no purpose. BRAMINTES was executed as a
traitor; and thus his magic ring proved a greater curse to him, than
before it had been a blessing to his brother.</p>

<p>The King, to make ROSIMUND some recompence for the loss of
so near a relation, returned him his ring, as a treasure of inestimable
value. The disconsolate ROSIMUND was of another opinion. He
went again to the grove, to find out his guardian Fairy. "Here, madam," 
says he, "once more take back your ring. My brother's fate is
now a full conviction of the truth you told me, though before, I could not
rightly comprehend you. Take back the fatal cause of my unhappy
brother's death. He might, alas! have still been living, and not have
brought down his poor parents grey hairs with sorrow to the grave.
He might, alas! have still been wise, have still been happy; had his
unruly passions been confined. O! how dangerous is the gift of
power! Take back your fatal ring. Unhappy is the man who next
enjoys it. I only beg this boon, that when you part with it again it
may not be bestowed on any friend of ROSIMUND'S."</p>

<h3>FABLE VI.</h3>

<h3>The ADVENTURES of FLORISA.</h3>

</div>

<p>A Poor country-woman had contracted an intimate friendship
with a Fairy. It happened the good woman was brought to
bed of a daughter, and the Fairy was invited as a favourite guest on
that joyful occasion. She came accordingly; and as the infant lay
in her arms, she thus bespoke the mother. "Make your own free
choice, my friend; this daughter of yours, if you request it, shall
be fair as the new-born day; the beauties of her mind shall still
be more conspicuous than her personal charms; she shall in time
be a powerful princess; but very unfortunate; or&mdash;she shall make
no figure in the world, be a plain, honest country-woman, like
yourself; but live at ease, contented with that little portion which
the Gods allot her."</p>

<p>The ambitious country-woman was soon
determined in her choice. "Give my daughter wisdom, beauty,
and a crown," she said, "at all adventures."</p>

<p>All on a sudden, young
cupids dance in her eyes, and her virgin-charms become the object
of envy and admiration. Her behaviour is affable, sweet and engaging; 
her apprehension quick and lively; whatever accomplishments
she studied, she attained them to the utmost degree of perfection. 
When she danced on any public festival upon the verdant
plain, her movement was inimitably graceful. Her voice was
sweeter than the lyre of Orpheus, and her airs were chiefly her own
composures. At first, she was all artless innocence; but as she was
playing on the margin of a transparent spring, she gazed with

<!-- page 36 -->

admiration on her beauteous form; and with a secret pride observed the
partial hand of nature. Whole crowds would stand in ranks to see
her pass along, which made her still more conscious of her charms.</p>

<p>The mother, relying on the friendship and foreknowledge of
the Fairy, viewed her child with partial eyes, traced the distant
princess in every little action, and almost spoiled her by excess of fondness.
The virgin-beauty now would neither spin, nor sew, nor tend
her sheep; but either range through all the meads, collect the gayest
flowers, and artfully dispose them in her dress; or walk, and sing,
and dance, beneath the sylvan shades.</p>

The King of the country
where she lived was a very powerful prince, and determined to marry
his only son, whose name was ROSIMOND, as soon as prudence
would permit. He would hearken, however, to no proposals of alliance 
with any of the neighbouring states, having been foretold by a
Fairy, that he should one day see a nymph more beauteous, more
accomplished than the gayest princess. He resolved, therefore, to
summon all the country-virgins throughout his kingdom, who were
under eighteen years of age, forthwith to repair to court, for his review 
and final choice.</p>

<p>A thousand moderate beauties attended on
this occasion. But thirty&mdash;to whom nature had been peculiarly indulgent&mdash;were 
soon distinguished from the crowd. FLORISA&mdash;for
that was the name of our enchanted beauty&mdash;procured the favour,
without solicitation, to be introduced amongst this happy number.
These thirty rural beauties were conducted into one of his majesty's
most spacious halls; and there ranged in an amphitheatrical form,
that the King and his son might survey them all at once in a proper
light. FLORISA, at first glance, appeared, amidst these candidates
for beauty, like the fairest spring-flower in a bed of marigolds, or an
orange-tree, in all its glory, amidst a row of brambles. The King,
without hesitation, declared FLORISA princess. ROSIMOND too
thought himself happy in his father's choice.</p>

<p>FLORISA now resigns

<!-- page 37 -->

her rural habit for royal robes, embroidered thick with gold. A
thousand costly jewels glitter round about her. A large train of
attendants wait upon her will. Happy is the lady that can study
what will please her best, and save her even the pain of thought.
A magnificent apartment was fitted up for her reception; the rooms
were lined round with costly looking-glass, instead of tapestry
hangings, that turn which way she would, with pleasure she might
see her charms reflected, and that the prince, wherever he cast his
eyes, with transport might adore them. Hunting, gaming, and the
thousand other entertainments of the court, were no amusements
now to ROSIMOND. All his pleasure centered in her charming conversation: 
and, as the old King his father died soon after <i>Hymen</i>
had confirmed their joys, FLORISA fulfilled the Fairy's prediction,
reigned as Queen, and by her good conduct, and peculiar penetration, 
settled the most important affairs of state with universal applause.</p>

<p><i>Chronipota</i>, the old Queen, whose temper was subtle, ill-natured 
and malicious, grew jealous of FLORISA; through the defects 
of nature and age together, she looked like a very fury. The
charms of FLORISA did but set her deformity in a more glaring
light, and provoked her to the last degree. The reflection that she
was only a foil to FLORISA was a pain insupportable. She was conscious 
of FLORISA's prudence and good conduct; and therefore
abandoned herself to all the outrages of malice and revenge. "Are
not you," she would often say to her son, "an abject, poor-spirited
prince, thus to wed an obscure country-lass, and set her up for
a Goddess? One too, that's as proud and imperious, as if she was
heiress to a throne. When your royal father thought of such a
settlement, he made me the object of his choice, as I was
daughter to a King, equal with him in glory. Thou shouldst
poor, unambitious boy, have traced his foot-steps. Send back, for

<!-- page 38 -->

shame, your sylvan Goddess to her shady groves. Act like a King,
and take some princess to your arms, whose birth and character
deserve the blessing."</p>

<p>As ROSIMOND, however, was deaf to her
reproofs, the inveterate <i>Chronipota</i>, to satiate her revenge, one
day intercepted a letter which FLORISA had wrote, in the most tender 
terms, a heart full of love and gratitude could conceive to her
royal master: this letter the fury gave to a young courtier, one
of her creatures, and enjoined him, on pain of her displeasure, to
own the contents directed to himself, to lay it before his majesty
with all the tokens of a loyal resentment, and to set FLORISA's
inconstancy and falsehood in the most odious light. ROSIMOND, in
the hurry and confusion of a jealous thought, and exasperated by
his mother's pernicious counsels, ordered FLORISA to be close confined 
for life, within a high tower, built on the summit of a rock,
that bellied over the sea. There she sat whole nights and days in
floods of sorrow, unable to conceive what she had done to merit
such inhuman treatment. No one was allowed to attend her, but
an old confident of <i>Chronipota</i>'s, who was instructed to insult her,
and triumph over her misfortunes. FLORISA now reflected on her
once happy state of life, her humble birth, and all her harmless
rural entertainments.</p>

<p>One day, as she was drowned in tears, deploring 
her ambitious mother's fatal choice, her old tormentor came
to tell her that the King's officer attended to behead her; and that
death alone could make atonement for her crimes. "Death," said
FLORISA, "to a wretch like me, is welcome.&mdash;I am prepared."&mdash;The 
officer, in short, through the misrepresentations of old <i>Chronipota</i>,
stood ready, with his sword drawn, to execute the King's commission; 
when, on a sudden, a lady, richly dressed, appeared, and
stopped the impending blow; asserting that she came from court,
with positive injunctions to deliver a private message to the dying

<!-- page 39 -->

Queen. Her old fury of a guardian readily acquiesced with these
pretended orders, not doubting but the lady was one of <i>Chronipota</i>'s 
retinue; but, in reality, she was the Fairy in disguise,
who had foretold FLORISA's troubles.</p>

<p>After having ordered
every person to withdraw, she thus addressed her. "Are you willing 
to resign your beauty, which has proved your ruin?&mdash;Will
you renounce your title to a crown, resume your rural dress, and
return to your former humble situation?" With transport
FLORISA accepted the proposal.</p>

<p>"Here, put on," says the Fairy,
"this enchanted mask." On the first application, her features began
to extend, and grow in disproportion. She now seems the disgrace,
as before, she appeared the pride of nature. Thus metamorphosed,
it was impossible to know her; and she passed unsuspected through
the guards, who were ordered to be spectators of her execution.
She followed the Fairy; and under her convoy arrived safe in her
own country. Strict search is now made all over the tower for the
unhappy beauty, but to no purpose. The news of this miraculous 
escape was related, with the utmost surprise to the King and
to <i>Chronipota</i>; who issued out fresh orders throughout the kingdom, 
but in vain, for her reprisal.</p>

<p>The Fairy delivered her safe
into her mother's hands, who had never known her daughter, had
she not been before apprized of her transformation. FLORISA was
very well contented to return to her former station, to be deformed,
and live in obscurity in the country; where all her business was to
tend her sheep. A day scarce past, but what she heard her tale
related, and her fall deplored. Her adventures, in short, were
the subject of a thousand songs so moving they commanded tears.
With pleasure she would sit, and sweetly sing those songs herself,
and weep with her companions: but thought herself more
happy now than ever, and to her dying day retained the secret.</p>

<h3>FABLE VII.</h3>

<h3>The HISTORY of ALFAROUTE and
CLARIFILIA.</h3>

</div>

<p>ONCE on a time there was a King, named ALFAROUTE, who
was the delight of his subjects, and the terror of all his enemies. 
He was a wise and good prince, just, valiant, and active;
deficient in no royal qualification. A Fairy, one day in private told
him, that some unforeseen misfortunes would attend him, unless he
prevented them, by virtue of a magic ring, which she put upon his
finger. When he turned the diamond within his hand, he became
immediately invisible; and the moment he turned it without, became 
visible again. This ring proved of singular service to him,
and was his favourite recreation. On the least mistrust of any ill-projecting
subject, by virtue of his ring, he was present with him
in his most secret retirements, and knew all his domestic concerns 
without the least observance. If he was apprehensive of an
invasion from abroad, he sat amidst their privy councils undiscovered.
Thus he baffled with pleasure all the projects that were formed to
sow dissentions amongst his people; found out all the plots and
conspiracies, though never so closely laid, against his person; and disconcerted 
all the measures of those, who would gladly subvert his
constitution.</p>

<p>This indulgence, however, of the Fairy's, did not
answer all the ends of his ambition: he begged a more extensive
power still; and wished, that by virtue of his ring, he could transport 
himself to distant regions in a moment. The Fairy, sighing,

<!-- page 41 -->

replied; "your demands are too large, my liege, you ought to
tremble at the thoughts of such a compliance."</p>

<p>ALFAROUTE,
however, still persisted in his request, regardless of the fatal consequence.
"Well then," said she, "against my inclination, I submit 
to your entreaties, the rashness of which, alas! too soon
you will repent." She sighed, and then&mdash;first washing his
back with a liquid perfume, disappeared.&mdash;Immediately, he
perceived young pinions rising on his shoulders. His little wings,
when he was dressed, could never be discerned: but when his
inclination led him to a flight, he only stroked them with his
hand; and in a moment they would extend so wide, that he could
cross over sea and land, with much more expedition than the swiftest
eagle. Whenever he purposed to alight, he stroked his wings again,
which in a moment contracted at his touch, and, as before, lay
quite concealed.</p>

<p>By virtue of this magic power, the King would
traverse round his kingdom in a moment; be well apprized of all
that passed abroad, though his courtiers could not conceive which way
he came by his intelligence; for he frequently pretended to have
business of importance that required secrecy; and would sometimes
shut himself up all day within his closet, and give positive commands
that no one should presume to interrupt him on any pretense whatsoever.
No sooner had he locked his closet-door, but his magic ring
was properly disposed, his wings were soon extended, and away he
flew through distant regions, quick as thought. In confidence of this
miraculous secret, he engaged himself in wars of the last importance; 
and in every battle that he fought, came off triumphant.</p>

<p>But as he was thus conversant with the very secrets of men's hearts,
and found them all so false, and so disloyal, he grew jealous of every
one about him. The more he extended his empire by conquest, the
less he gained the love and affection of his people; and to his great
mortification, he often found himself despised by those, whom he
had attached, as he thought, to his interest, by the strongest

<!-- page 42 -->

obligations. To remove this melancholy reflection, he determines
to take a tour all round the habitable globe, to find a wife, if possible,
fair as <i>Aurora</i>, and as virtuous as fair; one, that was every
way accomplished; one that should make his life completely
happy.</p>

<p>Long was he bewildered in the search, because his magic
power discovered too plainly the secret artifices of the fair. No court
was left unvisited; in all he found hypocrisy, and self-esteem their
reigning vices; all proud of gaining conquests. But all too conscious 
of their charms to recompence with pure affection the ardent
lover. From courts he now resorts to private families. These
were too gay and inconstant;&mdash;those deceitful and designing;&mdash;these 
imperious,&mdash;those humoursome;&mdash;falsehood and affectation,
he found, was all their practice. From thence, with discontent,
he seeks the plains; there he finds a nymph, fair as the new-born
day, artless and innocent, regardless of her beauty; a quality in her,
indeed, the least to be regarded; her virtue and unaffected modesty
shone more conspicuous. The neighbouring swains gazed on her
with delight, and sighed; but sighed in vain for the possession of
her charms.</p>

<p>Soon as the King beheld the beauteous charmer, the
God of love shot all his fires into his soul, and his whole heart received 
them. He made immediately an honourable proposal of
marriage to her father, who with pride contented, and with transport 
owned the obligation. CLARIFILIA&mdash;for that was our heroine's 
name&mdash;was immediately conducted, from her native cottage,
to a sumptuous palace, where thousands waited to receive her.
She was not transported with the pomp and splendor of a court:
her innocence, her modesty, and virtue still were preserved: and
though thus on a sudden raised from the cottage to the throne, she
still retained an humble sense of her mean birth and education.</p>

<p>The King grew fonder every day of his new bride, and flattered
himself that he should be completely happy in the possession of

<!-- page 43 -->

so captivating a beauty:&mdash;But jealousy, that poisonous passion, found
a passage to his breast, to interrupt the current of his joys. His eyes
invisibly were ever on her, observant of her private conduct; yet
still he found her chaste, the worthy object of his love and admiration. 
Still there remains some small distrust behind, which gives
him anxious pain. The Fairy, who had foretold the fatal consequence
that would attend his last request, whispered her cautions in
his ear so often, that he deemed her impertinent. Express orders
were immediately given, that she should leave the court; and the
Queen herself was instructed, on pain of his displeasure, never to
see her more. Her majesty, with great reluctance, complies with
this severe injunction; for the Fairy was her much respected friend
and favourite.</p>

<p>One day, the Fairy, desirous to inform the Queen
of some material occurrences, assumed the shape of one of her officers, 
and under that disguise, with ease gained admittance into her
private apartment, where, with pleasure, she discovered who she was.
The Queen flew into her arms with a true lover's fondness. The
King, who at the same time was there invisible, and saw their tender 
embraces, burned with fury and indignation. He drew his
sword, in the height of his resentment, and plunged it in the bosom
of the guiltless Queen. That moment the Fairy reassumed her
proper shape.&mdash;Instantaneously the King perceived his fatal error,
and confessed his CLARIFILIA virtuous.&mdash;ALFAROUTE would fain
have fallen upon his sword to make atonement. The Fairy interposed,
and strove to mitigate his sorrows.</p>

<p>The Queen, as she lay
weltering in her blood, and just expiring, faintly said.&mdash;"O! ALFAROUTE, 
though by thy cruel hand I die, I die thy ever faithful,
loving wife."</p>

<p>The King now mourned his wayward fate, and
his own rash request. He returned the fatal magic ring, and begged
the Fairy to retake his wings. The remnant of his days he spent in
gloomy thoughts and in excess of sorrow. The only mitigation of
his grief was once a day to visit CLARIFILIA's tomb, and bathe it
with his tears.</p>

<h3>FABLE VIII.</h3>

<h3>The STORY of the Old QUEEN and
PERONELLA.</h3>

</div>

<p>IN days of yore, there was a QUEEN so very ancient, that her
gums were all unarmed, and her forehead as bald, as an old
barren plain. Her head tottered, as the aspen leaf trembles, when
ruffled by the wind. Her eyes were dim, and sunk within their
sockets. Her visage was all rough, unfeatured, and deformed. She
was lower in stature by one-half than in her youth; she grew globular, 
and her mountain-back was so high, that any one might
justly think she had been crooked from her cradle.</p>

<p>A Fairy, who
was present at her mother's labour, approached, and thus addressed
her. "Have you an inclination to renew your youth?"</p> 

<p>"I should
be proud," replied the QUEEN, "of so valuable a blessing. All, all
my costly jewels, I'd resign with pleasure to be but twenty-one
again."</p>

<p>"Then," says the Fairy, "we must find some proper person,
who will assume your age, and willingly transfer her health and
youth to you. On whom shall we bestow your hundred years?"</p>

<p>Immediate search was made, by the QUEEN's orders, for such proper
person, as would gladly accept of the exchange. A crowd of beggars 
first surround the palace, and offer to be old, upon condition
to be rich; but when they beheld her rueful face, her ropy chain
of rheums, and all the thousand ills that hovered round her, they
looked upon her with an eye of pity, despised the proffer, and rather 
chose to beg in rags from door to door. Others, with vain,

<!-- page 45 -->

ambitious thoughts inspired, drew near the throne, to whom she
made large promises of titles and preferments; but, at the sight of
her, they cried; "honour is an empty name without enjoyment.
How should we blush to stir abroad, so hideous and deformed!"</p>

<p>At
length, a country lass, named PERONELLA, fair as <i>Aurora</i>, stood before 
the QUEEN, and for the crown itself, proposed the resignation
of her youthful bloom. The wrinkled QUEEN at first brow-beats
the virgin for her high demands: but to no purpose; young she
must be again, at all adventures.</p>

<p>"No, no," the QUEEN replied,
"the crown shall be divided, and we'll share it equally between us.
Sure that's reward sufficient for a girl like thee!"</p>

<p>Boldly the
maid replied, " 'tis not sufficient. The crown is mine or yours;
I'll still retain my poverty and blooming youth, keep you your
kingdom and your hundred years, with all its train of ills, and
death itself behind them."</p> 

<p>"But," says the QUEEN, "what shall
I do, when I've resigned my crown?"</p>

<p>"Be gay, and sing, and
dance as I do now," says PERONELLA:&mdash;then practised all before
her.</p> 

<p>The QUEEN, whose feeble knees knocked one against
another, replied, "And how will you behave yourself when once
my throne is yours? you are a stranger to the cares of age."</p>

<p>"I
don't well know," says PERONELLA; "but I'll make the best use of
it I can: I have an unaccountable inclination to try the experiment, 
for I have heard 'tis a most glorious thing to be a
QUEEN."</p>

<p>Whilst the QUEEN and PERONELLA were thus settling the purchase, 
in came the Fairy, and thus bespoke the country-maid.
"Are you willing to be made like to this old QUEEN, and try whether 
her state will be an agreeable exchange to you?"</p>

<p>"I am,"
says PERONELLA. Immediately her leathern face fits all in
wrinkles; all hoary are her hairs; she frets; she scolds; her crazy
noddle totters, and her shrivelled cheeks hang down beneath her
jaws; her age is now five score. The Fairy opens a little box, and

<!-- page 46 -->

out-starts a regular band of officers and courtiers, richly dressed,
who grew to their full stature as they marched, and paid their proper 
homage to the new-made QUEEN. They prepare a splendid
entertainment for her reception. But she has no appetite for all
their dainties, nor could she taste them if she had. She blushes,
and sits in pain; she knows not what to say, or do. She coughs,
till she is just expiring; she dribbles on her chin; a watery drop
hangs on her shrivelled nose, which she discharges with her sleeve.
She peers into the looking-glass, and finds her features more
wrinkled than an old grandame's ape.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the late
QUEEN stood, smiling in a corner: her eyes began to sparkle, and
her limbs to feel new life. Her hair grew beautifully black, her
teeth, like ivory, white; her completion ruddy as the blushing
rose; and her old crooked form rises by slow degrees as upright as
an arrow. But she was grown a perfect slattern; and though her petticoats 
hung only half-way down her legs; yet they were dirty,
and as draggled as a beggar's. This was an odd equipage to her;
and the guards, supposing her to be no other than some common
scullion, would have drove her headlong out of court.</p>

<p>Then PERONELLA thus bespoke the QUEEN. "We neither of us, I find,
live in our proper element.&mdash;Take you your crown again; give
me my rural dress."</p>

<p>That moment the exchange was made.
The QUEEN grew old again, and PERONELLA young. So fickle is
a female mind, they both again repented, but too late. The Fairy
now had doomed them irrecoverably to their proper stations. Every
day the superannuated QUEEN would weep; and, under the pressure
of every disorder, cry, alas! "Was I now PERONELLA, I should
lodge, indeed, in a poor, humble cottage, with chestnuts for my
food, instead of dainties; but then I should divert myself
amongst my fellow-swains, in dancing to their tuneful notes beneath 
the sylvan shades. What are soft beds of down to me,

<!-- page 47 -->

whose eye-lids never close in gentle slumbers? or crowds attending 
round me, when I die with pain?" </p>

<p>These melancholy reflections
made her ever restless and impatient; and twenty-four
physicians, who continually attended her, added new fuel to the
flame. In short, in about two months' time, death ended all her
woes. PERONELLA was dancing with her companions, on the
margin of a purling stream, when first she heard the mournful news;
and then she was convinced her happiness was owing more to
fortune, than her own good conduct.</p>

<p>Not long after, the Fairy
came again to PERONELLA, and offered three husbands to her
choice. The first, old, peevish, disagreeable, jealous, and ill-natured; 
but rich, of an illustrious family; and one, who, neither
night or day, would let her stir one moment from him. The second,
very handsome, good-natured, obliging, of an ancient and
honourable race; but poor, and unsuccessful in all his undertakings. 
The last, a country-man, neither handsome, nor disagreeable; 
one, who would neither dote upon her, nor abuse her; one,
in short, who was neither very necessitous, nor yet abounding.
PERONELLA was at a loss to make her choice; for she was naturally
fond of dress, of grandeur and magnificence. </p>

<p>"You are still a
silly girl, I find," says the Fairy, "you don't know your own advantage. 
The country-man is your bridegroom if you're wise.
You yourself would be too indulgent to the second; the first
would dote on you: in either of their arms you'd be unhappy.
The third would never use you ill: sit down contented with that
thought; 'tis better far to dance upon the fern, or verdant grass,
than in a palace;&mdash;and to be the poor contented PERONELLA
in a cottage, than the gay fashionable lady, surrounded with a
thousand cares. If you can bid adieu to all the vanity of false
ambition, you and your shepherd may be truly happy."</p>

<h3>FABLE IX.</h3>

<h3>LYCON.</h3>

</div>

<p>WHEN <i>Fame</i> had, with her brazen trump, proclaimed aloud
to all the rural deities, and <i>Cynthian</i> swains, that LYCON
would forsake them, a melancholy murmur filled the shady groves.
Echo, and all the adjacent vales repeat the mournful sounds. The
rural pipe, the flute and haut-boy, are now heard no more. The
shepherds, in excess of sorrow, break their reeds. All nature languishes
with sympathetic woe. The trees hang down their drooping 
heads, and lose their verdure. Till then the face of Heaven
was all serene; but now obscured with clouds. Now the bleak
north-wind unclothes the meadows, and disrobes the groves,
as at the approach of winter.</p>

<p>The rural Deities themselves bemoan
their loss. The Dryads quit their hollow oaks, and sigh for LYCON.
The mournful Deities assemble now beneath a lofty tree whose
summit reached the sky, whose wide-extended arms for ages past
had covered its old mother earth. The sylvan nymphs that used
to entertain themselves with dances, songs, and other harmless sports,
around this knotty, cumbrous tree; now met, alas! to drop their
tears, and tell their melancholy tale.</p>

<p>"O! we shall never see dear
LYCON more," they cry; "the dear, dear object of our wishes flies
our groves!&mdash;Too cruel fate thus to remove him from us!&mdash;Thrice
happy grove, which he shall honour with his pretense!&mdash;Now we
shall hear his tuneful voice no more; no more behold him bend
his bow, and with his arrows, unerring as <i>Apollo</i>'s, wound the feathered 
game."</p>

<p>Great <i>Pan</i> himself resigns his flute; the fauns and

<!-- page 49 -->

satyrs too suspend their dances to join the melancholy wood-nymphs.
The little harmless birds sit drooping on the boughs, and
quite forget their songs. Only the solitary screech-owl and the
ill-boding birds, with their ear-wounding notes, disturb the silence
of the groves. Sweet <i>Philomela</i>, with her tuneful choir, now cease
their warbling strains.</p>

<p>All on a sudden, <i>Flora</i> and <i>Pomona</i>, hand in
hand, appear within the center of the grove; smiles sit upon their
faces, glowing celestial red: the former wore a chaplet of roses on
her head, whilst primroses and violets sprang up beneath her feet:
the latter grasped within her hand a horn of plenty, filled with autumnal 
fruits, the grateful earth's return for the kind labours of the
swain.</p>

<p>"Be comforted&mdash;" they cried to the distressed assembly&mdash;"though
LYCON will, indeed, your groves forsake; yet still he flies no farther 
than the mountain consecrated to the God <i>Apollo</i>. There you
shall see him cultivate our happy gardens. With his own hands,
he there shall plant green trees; delicious roots for man's support,
and fragrant flowers for his amusement. Cease, cease, O north-wind,
with your poisonous blasts to ruffle LYCON'S favourite gardens.
Be kind to LYCON, who shall prefer his rural entertainments before 
the luxury of courts; shall love this happy situation, and leave
it with reluctance."</p>

<p>No sooner had they spoke, but sorrow turned
to joy: the subject of their songs was their loved LYCON'S praise.
He will, they cry, delight in gardens, as <i>Apollo</i>, when shepherd to
<i>Admetus</i>, loved his flocks. A thousand soft celestial songs filled
all the grove, and LYCON'S favourite name resounded from the forest
to the distant hills. The shepherds, with their tuneful pipes, repeat 
the pleasing sounds. The birds too, on the shady boughs, in
their own language, warble out the name of LYCON. Nature is
decked in all her pride; the trees are clothed with fruits, the fields
with flowers. The gardens, that wait for his return, boast all the

<!-- page 50 -->

beauties of the spring, and the gay gifts of autumn. The very distant 
looks of LYCON round the mountain have a magic power, and
make it fruitful there, when he has rooted up its numerous weeds
and barren plants, he shall collect the olive and the myrtle, and
wait with patience till the God of war directs him where to pluck
the laurel.</p>

<h3>A Compliment to a Young PRINCE, after
an ill Night's Rest.</h3>

</div>

<p>PHOEBUS, having traversed the expanse of Heaven, and run his
destined round, plunged deep his fiery coursers into the hesperian
waves. The horizon was bordered round with purple; the
sky seemed all inflamed with the bright tracks of light, the God
had left behind him. The scorching dog-star parched up the
thirsty plain. The plants lost all their verdure, and languished for
the dews. The fading flowers hung down their drooping heads;
nor could their feeble stalks support their weight. The very zephyrs 
withheld their gentle breezes. The air, which all things living 
breathed, was suffocating, close and sultry. Night, with her
cool, refreshing shades, could not allay the excessive heat; nor shed
those balmy dews on the laborious and dejected swains, which, in
the common course of nature, she distils, when the stars shine,
and <i>Hesper</i> twinkles bright behind them; nor had her crop of poppies 
power to charm to rest the languishing creation.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;bus</i> alone,
reclining on the soft bosom of his beauteous <i>Thetis</i>, slept at ease.
But when he waked, when the officious hours had got his chariot
ready, and <i>Aurora</i> had begun her rosy progress, he discerned the
face of Heaven all over-spread with clouds; saw the wild waste,
the ruins of the storm, which had the night before affrighted all
the lower world. From the damp earth the infectious vapours rose,
which added flame to the red lightning's flash, and horror to the

<!-- page 52 -->

thunder. The boisterous winds, with hideous roar, burst from
their stony caverns; the mountain-grounds smoked with the hasty
rains, which rolled in torrents down upon the valleys.</p>

<p>The golden
sun, who, with his beams magnetic, warms the world, saw as he
rose new devastations with concern; but with superior grief, beheld
a youth, the darling of the muses, his own peculiar favourite,
robbed of his repose by this impetuous storm, soon as the dew of
sleep had fallen upon him, and with soft, slumberous weight, inclined 
his eye-lids. The indulgent God was thinking to drive
backwards, and retard the day to recompense his loss. My darling
still, he cried, shall sleep. Still sleep shall seal his eyes, and hush his
cares, renew his health and strength, that he may imitate the great
<i>Alcides</i>, and add a sweetness to his disposition not to be expressed,
the only virtue that he possibly can want. If he sleeps sound and
laughs; softens his temper, and delights in play; if he but loves
mankind, and studies to be loved, the various graces will unite, and
form the man complete.</p>

<h3>FABLE XI.</h3>

<h3>Young BACCHUS and the Critic FAUN.</h3>

</div>

<p>ONE day, young BACCHUS, pupil to <i>Silenus</i>, was diverting
himself with the Muses in a grove, whose solemn silence
never was disturbed, but by the murmurs of soft, purling streams,
and the sweet harmony of warbling birds. So thick and gloomy
were the verdant shades, <i>Apollo</i>'s brightest beams could never pierce
them. The beauteous son of <i>Semele</i>, as he was studying the language 
of the Gods, sat at the foot of an old shady oak, whose sacred 
trunk was pregnant in the golden age with men. The oracles
of old from thence were given; there still it stood, and flourished
in immortal youth.</p>

<p>Behind this hollowed oak, a brisk, young
FAUN, unseen, stood listening to the verses which the God repeated,
and with a scornful air, whispered each little error to <i>Silenus</i>. At
some small distance the <i>Na&iuml;ades</i> and rural nymphs stood smiling.
Young was the critic, wanton and genteel. His head was dressed with
ivy mixed with vine-leaves. Clusters of grapes adorned his temples.
Over his left shoulder hung a curious scarf, composed of ivy wreathed;
and the young God was pleased to see his favourite leaves. From
the girdle downwards, the FAUN was dressed in a tremendous lion's
skin, the trophies of his conquest in the forest. In his hand he
grasped a knotty sheep-hook. He waved his tail, in many a wanton
wreath upon his back.</p>

<p>But as the God no longer could endure this
bold, insulting critic, who censured the least word irregularly placed,
with a stern look, and haughty tone, he cried: "How durst thou,
saucy FAUN, remark thus on the son of <i>Jove</i>?"</p> 

<p>The FAUN, undaunted, 
with a smile, replied: "How can the son of <i>Jove</i> commit
such blunders?"</p>

<h3>The NIGHTINGALE and LINNET.</h3>

</div>

<p>ON the ever verdant banks of the river <i>Alpheus</i> stands a grove,
where the <i>Na&iuml;ades</i> diffuse their noisy waters, and refresh the
new-born flowers. The Graces often bathe themselves in these
crystalline streams. The winds are partial to this peaceful grove,
and none but gentle zephyrs whisper through her trees. There the
nymphs and fauns by night assemble, and whilst <i>Pan</i> plays on his
melodious pipe, strike with their feet alternately the ground. So
thick, so interwoven are the trees, no sun-beams ever can pierce
them. There solemn silence reigns and peaceful gloom; there, night
and day, soft breezes fan the woods. Amidst the trembling leaves
sad <i>Philomela</i> sits, and tells her mournful tale; sings all the night;
but sings, alas! in vain. Upon another spray, a LINNET warbling
sings, and with her cheerful notes proclaims to all the neighbouring
swains the approach of spring. So sweet she sang, the Nightingale
herself grew jealous.</p>

<p>One day they spied a swain, within the center
of the grove, whom they had never seen before. They gazed on
him with pleasure, and took him for some noble youth, a lover of
the Muses and of Music. They fancied he might be <i>Apollo</i> in disguise,
as once he was when shepherd to <i>Admetus</i>, or at least some
hero to the Gods allied. The birds, by inspiration of the muses,
thus began their tuneful song in concert.</p>

<p><i>Who is this shepherd, or this God unknown, who honours thus our
grove? He listens to our harmless notes with pleasure. The Muses are,

<!-- page 55 -->

we find, his favourites: their melting sounds will tune his generous
soul, and make him lovely as he's great.</i></p>

<p>Then <i>Philomel</i> pursued the song alone.</p>

<p><i>O! may our Hero's virtues multiply, like the gay flowers in spring!
May he delight in innocent and rational amusements! May the soft Graces
hang on his lips, and wise</i> Minerva <i>dwell within his heart.</i></p>

<p>The LINNET then replied.</p>

<p><i>O! may the music of his tongue prove more melodious than the lyre of</i>
Orpheus! <i>May he in time to come be more renowned for his heroic
actions than</i> Alcides! <i>May he be more courageous, but not so rash, and
so unguarded as</i> Achilles! <i>May he be good and wise, love all mankind,
and be by them beloved! And may the muses tune his soul to every virtue!</i></p>

<p>Then the inspired birds again in chorus joined.</p>

<p><i>Our tuneful notes charm his attentive ears, and sink into his heart, as
gentle dews into the thirsty earth. May the gracious Gods incline his heart
to mercy, and make him ever happy! May his hand ever grasp the horn
of plenty, and through his means the golden age return! May his good
conduct influence all mankind, and flowers forever spring up where he
treads!</i></p>

<p>Whilst thus the feathered choristers their descants sang, the zephyrs, 
loth to interrupt their music, dropped their wings. The various 
parti-coloured flowers that then adorned the grove reared up
their cheerful heads. The streams, which the three <i>Na&iuml;ades</i> poured
from their noisy urns crept silently along. The fauns and satyrs
with ears erect, listened attentive to their charming sounds. Echo,
well-pleased, repeated every note to all the concave rocks. A long
train of <i>Dryads</i> issued from their hollow trunks to gaze with admiration 
on the godlike youth, for whose success sweet <i>Philomela</i> and
the warbling <i>Linnet</i> thus zealously in concert joined their wishes.</p>

<h3>The DRAGON and two FOXES.</h3>

</div>

<p>ONCE on a time, a DRAGON sat brooding over an immense
treasure, and to secure it, never closed his eyes to rest.
Two FOXES, well versed in every sly mercurial art, insinuated themselves 
into his favor by fulsome flattery and adulating address. He
entertained them as his friends and confidents.</p>

<p>We ought always
to be jealous of men's forward protestations: an artful complaisance
too often flows from a perfidious heart.</p>

<p>They pay their court to
him as to a King, applaud all his schemes, though never so ridiculous;
give into his sentiments, though most apparently unjust, and knowing
his foible, turn and wind him at their pleasure. In full confidence
of these two bosom-friends, he ventured to take an hour's repose;
but as soon as the credulous fool fell fast asleep, they strangled him,
and seized the glorious prize. Their next business was to divide
the plunder fairly between them; an affair not easily accomplished;
for villains seldom can agree in any point, but the bare execution of
their crimes.</p>

<p>One of these hypocrites, with a philosophic air addressed
his companion. "Brother," says he, "of what service is all this hoard of
gold to us? A hare, or a rabbit, had been a better booty. These same
guineas will prove but a poor meal. We have not stomachs, like the
ostrich, to digest them. What fools men are to make this gold their
God? Brother, let us be wiser."</p>

<p>The other with equal hypocrisy replied;
"your observations are strictly just, brother, and I'll assure you, they
have made a convert of me: I am now fully convinced, that the
philosopher is the happy man; and for the future, like <i>Bias</i> of old,

<!-- page 57 -->

I'll carry all I have about me."</p>

<p>Both affected to depart from the ill-gotten,
worthless treasure without reluctance: both lay in ambuscade;
and conscious of their mutual guilt, destroyed each other.</p>

<p>One, as he lay expiring, thus addressed his dying partner: "what
would you have done with all that gold had you succeeded?"</p>

<p>"The
same," replied the other, "as you proposed, had fortune favoured you."</p>

<p>By accident a passenger going by, and enquiring into the fatal cause
of their disaster, declared they were both fools.</p>

<p>"Fools as we are,"
says one of them, "you men are just the same. Gold is no more
food for you than us, and yet you'll cut your brother's throat for
gain. Before this unhappy accident, our prudent race despised the
fatal charm. That, which you introduced for the conveniency of
life, is now become its greatest torment. You fly from true felicity,
in search after an imaginary good."</p>

<h3>The Two FOXES.</h3>

</div>

<p>TWO FOXES contrived one night by stratagem to plunder a
hen-roost. The cock, the hen and chickens, fell an easy sacrifice
to their superior power. After this bloody conquest, the victors 
supped upon the spoil. One of them, that was young, and a
perfect epicure, proposed to eat them all at once. The other, that
was old and avaricious, thought it much more prudent to preserve
some part against a time of need.</p>

<p>"Dear child," said he, "experience
has made me wise. I have seen the world, and the vicissitudes of
fortune. Let us not be so lavish as to spend our substance all at once.
We have had good success; we have found a valuable treasure;
and let us improve it to the best advantage."</p>

<p>"Don't preach to me,"
says the young one; "for my part, I'll live here while I may; indulge
my noble appetite, and lay in provision for a week. They'll stink,
you old fool, to-morrow. 'Tis nonsense to talk of our return: the
farmer, should he catch us, would, no doubt, revenge their cause,
and murder us, as we have them."</p>

<p>After this pert reply, each acted
according to the dictates of his inclination. The young one indulged
himself so long, that he almost burst his belly, and with much difficulty 
crawled into his kennel, where in a few hours he died. The
old one, who had more conduct, and a greater command of his passions, 
returning to his hoard the next morning, was way-laid, and
fell a victim to the countryman's resentment.&mdash;Thus every age is
prone to its own darling vice.&mdash;The young are wild and boundless
in their pleasures;&mdash;the old avaricious, and incorrigibly so to the last.</p>

<h3>The WOLF and the LAMB.</h3>

</div>

<p>A Flock of sheep were safely grazing in an enclosed meadow;
the dogs were all asleep, and their master, with some fellow-swains,
sat playing on their tuneful pipes beneath a shady elm. A
WOLF, with hunger pinched, peeped through the hedge, and with a
wishful eye surveyed the flock. An unexperienced thoughtless LAMB
approached him.</p>

<p>"What, sir," said he to the voracious stranger, "is
it you want within our pasture?"</p>

<p>"To taste your tender, flowery grass,"
replied the WOLF. "What can be more delicious, than to graze as
you do on the verdant meads, enamelled round with flowers, and
slake one's thirst in the transparent rills? Here, I perceive, you live
in perfect plenty. For my part, my ambition would rise no higher:
I've learned by philosophic rules to live contented with a little."</p>

<p>"Say you so," said the LAMB, "have you no appetite for flesh, and
will a little grass suffice you? I find, you have been misrepresented;
let us live sociably, and graze together."</p> 

<p>Immediately the LAMB
leaps over the fence. As soon the grave philosopher turns tyrant,
and tears him limb from limb. Always suspect the sincerity of
such as with studied expressions applaud their own virtues. Eloquence 
may betray you. Let actions speak the man.</p>

<h3>The CAT and the RABBITS.</h3>

</div>

<p>ONE day a CAT, with an affected, modest air, traversed a
warren, plentifully flocked with BUCKS and DOES. The
whole republic trembled at the sight of him, and plunged into
their burrows. As this stranger, with a sly imperious eye, stood
peering at the mouth of one of their recesses; the states, who with
terror had observed his dreadful claws, ordered their deputies, at
their most narrow avenue, to parley with him, and demand the cause
of his arrival. <i>Grimalkin</i>, in a soft, friendly tone, protested his design
was innocent; that all his aim was to inform himself of the
laws of their republic: that, as he made philosophy his study, he
determined to travel round the globe purely to gratify his curiosity,
and learn the various customs of the brutal world.</p>

<p>The unguarded,
credulous deputies, immediately made the following report to their
lords and masters; that this stranger, whose modest deportment
and majestic dress commanded their respect, was a sober, harmless
pacific philosopher; that he was travelling through various kingdoms
for the cultivation of his mind; that he had seen a thousand curiosities
in foreign parts; that his conversation was extremely entertaining; 
that there was no danger of his destroying any of their
young ones; that he was, in short, one of <i>Brahmin</i>'s disciples; that
the metempsychosis was an article of his faith, and flesh his utter
aversion.</p>

<p>The grand assembly were charmed with this eloquent
harangue. A sage, old BUCK, who had long been their speaker,

<!-- page 61 -->

was justly jealous of this grave philosopher, and offered many substantial
reasons to justify his suspicions, but to no purpose. Notwithstanding
all his wise precautions, they went in a body to pay
their compliments in the most solemn manner, to this great <i>Brahminist</i>, 
who, at their first approach, seized seven or eight, and slew
them on the spot. The rest, with much difficulty and confusion,
recovered their burrows, but hung down their heads, ashamed of
their credulity.</p>

<p>Soon after this tyrannic insult, the CAT returned
to the mouth of the burrow, where he parleyed with them first, and
there made the largest protestations of his unfeigned sorrow and
repentance: he alleged that fatal necessity, and not choice, had
compelled him to such an act of hostility; and assured them, that
for the future he'd live contented with meaner diet, and should
think himself happy, if they'd forgive this first transgression, and
for the future live in peace. The republic thought proper to accept 
of his contrition; but determined to expose themselves as
little as possible to his arbitrary power. They sign the treaty, and
pay him homage at a distance.</p> 

<p>In the mean time, one of the boldest
and most active BUCKS steps slyly out at a back-door, to a
neighbouring shepherd,&mdash;who delighted to captivate the young ones,
as they munched the juniper berries&mdash;relates their whole adventure.
The swain resenting the tyrannical proceedings of the CAT, hastens
with his bow and arrows to the warren. He found the CAT attentive 
on his prey. Unseen, a fatal shaft flew to his breast. The
tyrant, as he lay expiring, sighed out this just reflection.</p>

"The Hypocrite, 
when once discovered is believed no more: he is forever
hated, ever feared; and is at last by his own stratagems betrayed."</p>

<h3>The MICIAN TRAVELLERS.</h3>

</div>

<p>A MOUSE that lived forever restless and uneasy, forever
tormented with frightful apprehensions of the Cat, and
her destructive party, one day called to a bosom-friend, who
lodged within a hole contiguous to her own, and thus addressed her.</p>

<p>"Neighbour," said she, "I have a project in my head. As I was at
breakfast one morning in a curious library, I turned over a certain
book of travels, and cast my eye on a very remarkable passage.
There is a beautiful country, says my author, called the <i>Indies</i>,
where the mician race are treated with much more gentleness, and
live much freer from insults and oppression than we do here. In
that country 'tis the received opinion of the Sophi, that the soul of
a mouse may possibly have been the soul of a minister of state, an
archbishop, or a king; and afterwards by transmigration, animate
some superior beauty, some lady of the first distinction.</p>

<p>"To the best
of my remembrance, he calls this the metempsychosis. This being
an established maxim amongst them, they treat every species of the
brutal world with abundance of indulgence and good will. Hospitals
are there erected for the reception of the mician race: they
have an annual pension, and a table allowed them, like persons of
distinction. Let us try our fortune, neighbour; set sail for these
happy islands, where their laws are so refined; and merit meets
with such a due regard."</p>

<p>"But, neighbour," replied her companion,
"are there no Cats in those hospitals you speak of?&mdash;If there should,
I fancy that same metempsychosis, as you call it, would be a

<!-- page 63 -->

practice much in vogue there, and by some unlucky squeeze or
another, we soon should change our forms, and become heroes or
monarchs, perhaps against our inclinations."</p>

<p>"Never fear, says the
first, they are strictly regular in all their economy: the cats have
their separate apartments as we have ours: they have another hospital
of invalids erected at a proper distance."</p>

<p>This important objection 
thus removed, our two Mice determined on their voyage;
and by the help of a cable, which was lashed to the shore, got on
board a vessel, the night before they weighed anchor, bound for the
<i>Indian</i> coast. Away they sail; the winds prove propitious: with
transport they traverse the ocean, and take their farewell of an
island, where cats rule with such tyrannic sway. They had a safe
and speedy passage. They landed at <i>Surat</i>, not like merchants,
with a view of advantageous commerce; but in hopes to find a
courteous reception from the natives.</p> 

<p>No sooner were they settled
as they proposed in one of the mician apartments, but they proudly
assumed a superiority over the rest, and laid claim to the best places
in the house. The first pretended she had been a celebrated <i>Brahmin</i>
on the coast of <i>Malabar</i>. The other insisted, that she had been a
celebrated toast there, and admired for her ears that almost touched
the ground.</p>

<p>In short, they were both so saucy and imperious, that
the <i>Indian</i> Mice no longer would endure their pride and insolence.
A civil war immediately ensued. They unanimously opposed these
two conceited upstarts. Instead of becoming a prey to their common 
foe the cat, they fell a bloody sacrifice to the resentment of
their own fraternity. 'Tis to little purpose to fly for refuge into
foreign countries: without a modest and prudent deportment. We
only take a deal of pains to be unhappy: misfortunes can but attend
us nearer home.</p>

<h3>The BEASTS assembled to elect a KING.</h3>

</div>

<p>NO sooner was the Lion dead, but beasts of all denominations
flocked to his den, and courtiers-like, condoled with the Lioness, 
his royal relict, who made the forests, and the distant mountains 
tremble with her awful roaring. After the usual compliments 
they proceeded to a new election. The crown of the deceased
was, with all due solemnity and decorum, placed in the
midst of the august assembly.</p>

<p>His royal offspring was too feeble
and too young to seize the crown, to which so many much more
powerful creatures laid their claim. "Give me but time to grow a
little," says the royal cub, "and in a few years you shall find I can
fill the throne, and make the world around me tremble, as my father 
did before me. In the mean time, I'll practise the heroic
actions of my ancestors, and one day equal them in glory."</p>

<p>"The
crown I challenge," says the Leopard, "as my regal right. My person
is the nearest representative of his late majesty deceased."</p>

<p>"As for
my part," says Bruin, "I insist upon it: 'tis an act of injustice to
prefer the Leopard before me. I boast an equal strength; am as
courageous, and as blood-thirsty as he; add to this&mdash;an advantage
of no small importance&mdash;my art of climbing trees."</p>

<p>"I appeal,"
says the Elephant, "to the whole assembly here present, whether any
one, with justice, can pretend to be so big, so strong, or so sedate
as I am."</p> 

<p>"I am the noblest, the most beautifully formed of all the
brutal world," replied the Horse.</p>

<p>"I the most politic," strait Reynard

<!-- page 65 -->

cried.</p>

<p>"Who's swifter," said the Stag, "than I?"</p>

<p>"Where," said the Monkey, 
"can you find a king so gay, so entertaining as myself? my
actions would he ever pleasing to my loving subjects. Besides, who
is so near allied to man, the lord of the creation?"</p>

<p>The Parrot interposed,
and made his speech. "I think, sir, I can boast that right
with a much better grace than you. Your frightful phiz, I own,
and antic postures faintly resemble his. I boast a nobler faculty:
I imitate his speech, the demonstration of his reason, and his greatest
glory."</p>

<p>"Pert fool," replied the Monkey, "hold your peace. You
talk 'tis true, but not like man. You chatter only a set form of
words; not one you understand."</p>

<p>These two egregious copiers of
mankind made all the assembly smile. At last, after a long debate,
the Elephant was crowned their king elect: he had, they owned,
sufficient strength and conduct to protect them: abhorred the arbitrary 
power of beasts of prey, and never was so idly vain, so self-conceited,
as to pretend to be what, in reality, he was not.</p>

<h3>The MONKEY.</h3>

</div>

<p>AN arch, old MONKEY having departed this life, his ghost
descended to the infernal regions, and there petitioned <i>Pluto</i>
for his indulgence to return to earth. The God consented he should
animate the dull, inactive Ass, to cure him of his thousand little,
sprightly, sly, unlucky pranks. But the gay, comic ghost performed 
his wanton fopperies with such success before him, that the
grim monarch laughed aloud, and granted what he asked without
restriction.</p>

<p>"With your majesty's permission then, I'll now inform
the Parrot. By this transmigration," said he, "I shall at least retain
some faint resemblance of mankind, whose actions I so long have
copied. When a Monkey, their gestures were the objects of my
imitation; when a Parrot, I shall mimic their discourse."</p> 

<p>No
sooner had the Monkey's soul informed the Parrot, but a silly,
tattling, superannuated lady purchased him. He was the darling of
her heart, and honoured with a curious cage. His fare was uncommonly 
delicious, and he prattled all day long with the old
dotard, whose discourse was as nonsensical as his. To this new
noisy faculty, he subjoined I know not what of his old little affectations. 
His head was in perpetual motion. His bill cracked;
his wings fluttered; and his feet were thrown into a thousand ridiculous 
postures. His old mistress would, ever and anon, mount
her spectacles upon her nose to peer at her favourite bird. She
would often lament, that her ears were somewhat defective, by

<!-- page 67 -->

which misfortune she too often lost the beauty of poor Poll's expressions,
which she imagined were ever witty and refined. The
Parrot, by this excessive indulgence, grew loud, impertinent and
foolish.</p>

<p>In short, he was so restless, so wanton in his cage, and
sipped cordial waters so plentifully with his old lady, that once more
he died. His ghost making now its second appearance before the
throne of <i>Pluto</i>, the God resolved to tongue-tie him forever, and
doomed him to animate a fish: but when the gloomy monarch
saw again his comical grimaces, he revoked the sentence.</p>

<p>Princes
sometimes favour fools and parasites. The ghost is a second time
indulged, and suffered to inform a man. But as the God had some
regard for virtue, he carefully confined him to the body of a noisy,
impertinent tongue-pad; a fellow, that was forever venting improbable 
stories; a self-conceited coxcomb; an unnatural mimic;
a snarling, injudicious critic; one, in short, that would interrupt
the most refined conversation, to hear himself talk, and introduce
his own nonsensical discourse.</p>

<p><i>Mercury</i>, who recollected him, though
so disguised, thus with a smile addressed him. "Thou fool, I know
thee well enough. I've seen thee long ere now. Thou worthless
compound of the Ape and Parrot! Take but away thy antic gestures,
and a few hard terms, which thou hast learnt by rote, but canst
not understand, and thou hast nothing left. A pretty Parrot and a
sprightly Monkey, when compounded, make but one silly coxcomb."</p>

<p>Alas! what numbers are there in the town, who by their artful
cringes, studied addresses, and affected airs, without one grain of
wisdom are caressed, and thought men of vast importance?</p>

<h3>The two Young LIONS.</h3>

</div>

<p>TWO young LIONS had been reared together in one forest.
Their stature, strength and age were equal. One was taken
captive by the Great Mogul. The other ranged, without restraint,
amongst the craggy mountains. The first was by the huntsmen
strait conveyed to court, where long he lived in luxury and ease.
He seldom dined without an antelope, or ever reposed but on a bed
of down. A fair eunuch constantly attended twice a day, to comb
his graceful golden mane. When he was polished and made tractable, 
the monarch would himself caress him. He soon grew
plump, smooth, comely and majestic. A golden collar graced his
neck; diamonds and pearls adorned his ears. He looked with an
eye of contempt on his brother-lions, who inhabited the dens
adjacent; they were not equal favourites with him; nor their
apartments so commodious or well-furnished as his own. His
grandeur and success with pride elate his heart; he vainly thinks
the favours that he meets with, the result of merit. His court-education
fired his mind with false ambition. He imagined,
that had he ranged the forest unconfined, by this time he had
been some mighty hero.</p>

<p>One day, he quits the court, and travels, 
big with expectation, to his native country. At the same
juncture his old royal master died; and the states were all assembled,
to fill by vote the vacant throne. Among the numerous
candidates, there appeared one much sterner and much more

<!-- page 69 -->

imperious than the rest. This lordly, dauntless hero was our gay
courtier's old companion, who had never been a slave. Whilst
the one had been indulged in all the luxury and pride of courts;
the other, urged by the pure appetite of nature, was often exercised
in dreadful combats, and scorned all dangers for a bare subsistence.
Shepherds as well as flocks fell victims to his fury. His
carcass was both lean and shaggy; ghastly were his looks. His
eyes were bloodshot, and seemed all on fire. His limbs were strong
and active; he could climb the trees, and spring upon his prey,
fearless of darts or javelins.</p>

<p>These two old companions proposed
to the august assembly to decide their right by single combat. But
an old, sage, experienced Lioness, to whose judgment the whole
body paid peculiar deference, persuaded them to fix upon the
throne, without delay, the politician that was bred at court.
There were several malcontents on this advice: they murmured,
that an effeminate, luxurious prince should be preferred; whilst the
bold warrior, long inured to toils, fearless of dangers, and well
able to support his cause, should be neglected. However, the old
Lioness, by her superior influence, hushed the rising storm, and
fixed the courtier on the throne.</p>

<p>At his first accession to the
crown he revelled in delight; indulged himself in luxury and ease;
by artifice and smooth address, concealed his innate fury, and his
love of lawless power. His subjects soon neglected, scorned, detested
him.</p> 

<p>"Now," says the old Lioness, " 'tis proper to dethrone
him. I foreknew his want of merit; but was desirous you should
have a monarch for a while, bred up and spoiled in a luxurious
court, that you might learn to value courage, conduct and true
merit, where you found it. Now is the time to let them fight or
die.</p>

<p>The two heroes were immediately conducted into a large
enclosure, and the assembly, big with expectations, gazed at the
gallant show, a show, that soon was over. The courtier trembled

<!-- page 70 -->

at his foe, and durst not once approach him. He fled, and strove
to be concealed. The forester pursued, and called him with disdain
a coward.</p>

<p>All the spectators cried; "tear him in pieces.
Have no mercy on the poor poltroon."</p> 

<p>"No, no," replied the victor,
"when a coward is a foe, 'tis cowardice indeed to be afraid. Let
him still live. Death, from my hands, would be too great an
honour. I shall know how to reign, and keep him ever in subjection
without danger."</p>

<p>In short, the dauntless Lion ruled his
subjects with the wisdom and good conduct of <i>Minerva</i>. The
other was content to cringe, and creep, and fawn for trivial favours;
and spent the poor remainder of his days, in shameful and inglorious 
ease.</p>

</div>

<p>ONE day, when gentle zephyrs fanned the air, and nature was
arrayed in all her glory, a young, gay Prince was walking
in a curious garden. All on a sudden, an unusual sound invades
his ears; he turns about, and at a distance sees a bee-hive. The
novelty induced him to approach it. With pleasure and amazement
he observed the industry, the conduct and economy of that republic. 
Their cells were very visible, and regularly formed. One
party was employed to fill those cellars with nectar. Others
brought in their store of flowers, collected from the bosom of the
spring. In this republic none lived in indolence and ease. Every
one was full employed; but no one hurried, or confounded.
Those at the helm, directed the inferiors, who laboured all the day,
without a murmur, or the least reflection.</p>

<p>As their exact obedience 
was the peculiar object of the Prince's admiration, a Bee,
whom all the commonwealth acknowledged as supreme, with graceful 
air approached, and thus addressed him.</p>

<p>"The economy,
which you observe amongst us, has been, I find, an amusement to
you: but make it rather, royal Sir, a lesson of instruction. No
factious fools, no lawless libertines, are known amongst us. No

claim to posts of trust. We study night and day to be of service to
mankind. O! may I live to hail the day, when you shall copy

creatures, that none but fools would ever regard you."</p>

<p>"No nation
under the sun," replied the BEE, "has that good conduct and economy
as we have. Our laws are all peculiar to ourselves, and our republic
is the wonder of the world. We trade in nothing but celestial honey, 
a liquor as delicious as the nectar of the Gods. Out of my
sight, thou saucy, worthless wretch, whose every meal's offensive."</p>

<p>The FLY replied, "we make our lives as easy as we can: adversity's
no crime, though passion is. Your honey, I allow, is to perfection pure;
but your proud hearts are wretchedly polluted. Your laws with
justice all admire. But then your constitutions are too warm: you
all take fire too soon. You'll sacrifice your lives to gratify the least
resentment. 'Tis better to be modest and good-natured, than haughty
and imperious, and have so nice a taste for mere punctilios."</p>

<h3>FABLE XXIII.</h3>

<h3>The BEES and the SILK-WORMS.</h3>

</div>

<p>ONE day the Bees soared up as high as the throne of <i>Jupiter</i>,
fell prostrate at his feet, and with submission hoped for his
indulgence, in return for their good offices of old, their former
care of him when a helpless infant on <i>Mount Ida</i>. <i>Jove</i>
graciously accepted their address, and thought it was just to grant
them the precedence to all other insects: but Minerva, who presides
over all the arts and sciences, informed him, that there was
another race as beneficial to mankind as they.</p>

<p>"Their names,"
says Jove.</p>

<p>The Goddess answered him, "the Silk-Worms&mdash;" forthwith, 
the God commissioned <i>Mercury</i> to summon all their deputies,
and ordered proper zephyrs to attend him, who should waft them
on their gentle wings to high <i>Olympus</i>, that he himself might
hear what the contending parties had to offer.</p>

<p>The ambassadress
from the republic of the Bees opened the solemn cause; enlarged
upon the sweetness of their honey, the nectar of mankind, its
various virtues, and its artful composition; from thence proceeded
to the wisdom of their laws, and the exact economy of their
republic. "We," continued the female orator, "and we alone can
boast the honour of supporting the great father of the Gods,
when, in a cave exposed, a tender, helpless infant. Moreover,
our courage in the field is equal to our industry at home; let but
our royal leader bid us charge the foe, we bravely fight or die.
Invincible assurance! How could these Worms, these abject,

<!-- page 74 -->

worthless insects, think to dispute this point with us? Insects,
that only grovel upon earth; whilst we have nobler powers; with
golden wings can mount the azure skies."</p>

<p>To this the advocate
for the Silk-Worms modestly replied. "We readily acknowledge
that we are but reptiles; that we cannot boast that courage and
good conduct which our antagonists most justly can. However,
each individual member of our state is a mere prodigy in nature,
and for the public good consumes his very vitals. Though lawless,
still we live in peace. No civil discords ever distract our state, to
which the factious Bees are ever subject.</p>

<p>"Like <i>Proteus</i> we are
ever changing, and though our form's but small, we boast eleven,
gay, parti-coloured ringlets, beauteous as the bow of <i>Iris</i>, or the
most artificial flower. Our labours grace the monarch on the
throne; nay more, they help to furnish the gay temples of the
Gods. Our manufacture's beautiful and lasting; not like their
honey, which, though sweet whilst new, is very subject to decay.</p>

<p>"In short, we transform ourselves to little Beans; but Beans, that
have a grateful smell; that still retain their motion, and the signs
of life. At last, we metamorphose into gaudy Butterflies. Then
are our forms more beauteous than the bees; then we can boast
as bold a flight towards Heaven as they. I've nothing more to
offer, but submit to <i>Jove</i>."</p>

<p>The God was at a loss to give his
final judgment in so nice a cause; at last, however, he declared in
favour of the Bees; since custom time out of mind confirmed
their right. "How ungrateful should I be," <i>Jove</i> added in excuse,
"should I degrade my friends, who served me in distress. No, I'll
ever own the favour. However, still, in my private opinion, mankind
have greater obligations to the Silk-Worms."</p>

<h3>The Conceited OWL.</h3>

</div>

<p>A Young OWL, who, <i>Narcissus</i>-like, had surveyed himself
with pleasure in a crystal stream, and thought himself, not
only fairer than the light, for <i>Ph&oelig;bus</i> is no deity of his, but fair
as Night herself, his favourite Goddess, thus began his proud soliloquy.</p>

<p>"How often have I offered incense to the Graces! When
I was born, fair <i>Cytharea</i> dressed me in her cestus. Young smiling
cupids fan their wanton wings around me. I'm now of age;
<i>Hymen</i> shall bless me with a numerous issue, beauteous as myself:
they shall in time become the glory of the groves, the darlings of
the night! O! should the race of Owls be once extinct, the loss
would be irreparable. Thrice happy must that fair one be, that
shall be circled in my arms!"</p>

<p>Fired with these self-conceited
thoughts, he sends the Crow to the dread monarch of the birds
with bold proposals of a match between himself and his fair
daughter, the royal Eaglet.</p>

<p>Fain would the Crow have been
excused from this commission. "What reception can I expect,"
said she, "in the proposal of a match so visibly unequal? How can
you imagine, that the Eaglet, who can, unhurt, gaze steadfast on
the sun, should wed with you, whose tender eyes can't bear the
dawn of day? Light and darkness can never possibly agree. You'd
live forever in a state of separation."</p>

<p>The self-conceited Owl was
deaf to all advice. The Crow, to soothe his vanity, complied at
last, and made the proposition.</p>

<p>They smiled at the ridiculous

<!-- page 76 -->

request. However, the monarch answered; "if your master be
ambitious of my favour, let him meet me in the regions of the air
to-morrow about mid-day."</p> 

<p>The proud ambitious fool attempts the
flight. All on a sudden a dim suffusion veiled his eyes: unable to
endure the radiant light, downwards he sunk upon a rock. All the
feathered race pursued, and stripped him of his plumes. A cavern
now he finds his greatest happiness, and he resolves to wed an Owl,
an humble tenant of the rock. The nuptials were consummated at
night; and as they both were blind, they thought each other fair.</p>

<p>Pride will have its fall. We should not aim to shine in spheres we
cannot possibly adorn.</p>

<h3>FABLE XXV.</h3>

<h3>CLEOBULUS and PHILLIS.</h3>

</div>

<p></p>A Pensive shepherd once led his flock to pasture on the flowery
banks of the river <i>Achel&ouml;us</i>. The Fauns and Satyrs, that
lay concealed in the adjacent groves, danced on the verdant grass
to his melodious pipe. The water-nymphs, sporting beneath the
waves, advanced amidst the rushes, attentive to his charming music.
<i>Achel&ouml;us</i> too, reclining on his urn, reared up his head, which, since
his combat with the mighty <i>Hercules</i>, had lost a horn, and the harmonious 
sounds suspended for a time the tortures of the vanquished
God. The admiring Na&iuml;ades made no impression on the swain:
PHILLIS alone was the dear object of his wishes; PHILLIS, the plain,
the modest nymph, the beauty unadorned; who never shone with
borrowed rays; contented with those charms alone the Graces gave
her.</p>

<p>PHILLIS went from home into the meadows, thoughtful of
nothing but her tender flock, herself alone insensible of all her
charms; the neighbouring nymphs grew jealous. The swain adored
her, but wanted courage to declare his passion. Her severe virtue
and unaffected modesty, those never-dying charms of beauty, that
awed her lovers, and kept them at a distance, were the chief objects
of his admiration; but <i>Cupid</i> is a subtle God; a thousand little 
arts he soon invents that shall reveal the secret. The shepherd 
soon concluded the pleasing, though unstudied song he had begun,
to introduce another, more artificial, that might melt his charmer
down to love. He knew her taste; that she admired stories of

<!-- page 78 -->

heroic virtue. He sung, therefore, under a fictitious name, his
own adventures; for in those days heroes themselves were shepherds,
and condescended to their dress. Thus then he began his martial
song.</p>

<p>"When <i>Polynices</i> went to the siege of <i>Thebes</i>, in hopes to dethrone 
his brother <i>Eteocles</i>, all the Grecian powers espoused his
cause, and armed in their chariots, lay before the city. Here
<i>Adrastus</i>, father-in-law to the great <i>Polynices</i>, with fury urged the
war: Thousands fell victims to his sword; as the yellow harvest
bends beneath the sickle. There <i>Amphiar&auml;us</i>, the celebrated sorcerer,
who had foretold his own untimely fate, mingled amongst
the crowd, when, on a sudden, the earth gaped wide, and swallowed
him to quick destruction. As he was tumbling down the dark
abyss, he cursed his planet, and his day of marriage. At some small
distance, the two sons of <i>Oedipus</i> were close engaged in dreadful
combat. As the Leopard and the Tyger, when they meet upon the
rocks of <i>Caucasus</i>, with inbred fury contend for victory; so these
irreconcilable heroes fought rolling upon the ground, resolved to
die or conquer.</p>

<p>"During this unnatural engagement <i>Cleobulus</i>, an
attendant on <i>Polynices</i>, opposed a mighty <i>Theban</i>, a favourite of <i>Mars</i>,
The arrow, which the Theban threw, directed by the God himself,
had sealed the fate of young CLEOBULUS, had he not, with incredible 
activity, sprung from the deadly blow. CLEOBULUS, in a
moment, turned upon the Theban, and with his javelin struck him
to the heart. The reeking blood gushed from the gaping wound;
his eyes grew dim and languishing; his soul lay struggling to be
loosed, and death soon cast his fable veil over all his manly features. 
Soon as the dear partner of his bed discerned from a high tower her
husband's fall, her lovely eyes were drowned in floods of sorrow.</p>

<p>"Thrice happy soldier, though thus vanquished to be so pitied, and so
well beloved! With how much transport could I yield to fate on
such conditions! What is youth, what is beauty, and a thirst for fame,

<!-- page 79 -->

if the fair nymph, the object of our wishes, still disdains us?"</p>

<p>PHILLIS, who listened with attention to his charming song, was now
convinced, the shepherd was himself CLEOBULUS, that slew the
<i>Theban</i>. His conquest now began to fire her heart; she views his
beauties with a lover's eye, and pities all his pains. The fair now
gives her hand, and plights her faith; In a few days, <i>Hymen</i> confirmed 
their joys. The neighbouring swains, the rural Deities themselves, 
with envious eyes, behold the happy pair. They lived together 
to a good old age, and spent their days, like the famed
<i>Baucis</i> and <i>Philemon</i>, in rural sports, in innocence and love.</p>

<p class="center">CHROMIS.</p>

<p>HOW cool this grotto is! What stately trees! How thick and

sweetly <i>Philomela</i> tells her mournful tale!</p>

<p class="center">MNASYLUS.</p>

<p>True, these are charms; but there are nobler objects still in
view.</p>

<p class="center">CHROMIS.</p>

<p>What! those statues do you mean? For my part, I can see no
beauty in them. How unpolished that first figure seems to be!</p>

<p class="center">MNASYLUS.</p>

<p>'Tis the image of a beauty for all that. But no more on that
topic. For a brother-swain, you know, has said all that can possibly
be offered in its commendation.</p>

<p class="center">CHROMIS.</p>

<p>Then you mean that shepherdess, I presume, that bends over the
fountain.</p>

<p class="center">MNASYLUS.</p>

<p>No, no, nor that. Our <i>Lycidas</i> has tuned her praises on his rural
pipe; and who shall after him presume to sing?</p>

<p class="center">CHROMIS.</p>

<p>Then you must certainly mean that young figure in the corner.</p>

<!-- page 81 -->

<p class="center">MNASYLUS.</p>

<p>I do so.&mdash;If you observe, it has not that rural air as the other two
have.&mdash;'Tis a Goddess, you must know. <i>Pomona</i>, or one of her
attendants at least: in her right hand, she grasps a cornucopi&aelig;, filled
with autumnal fruits; in her left an urn, from whence, with a
profuse hand, she scatters gold; possessed at once of the gay products
of the earth, the wealth of nature, and those richer treasures
which mankind adore.</p>

<p class="center">CHROMIS.</p>

<p>How she declines her head!&mdash;Is that an artful posture?</p>

<p class="center">MNASYLUS.</p>

<p>Yes:&mdash;for all statues, if elevated high, to be surveyed below,
stand in the fairest point of light, when they incline.</p>

<p class="center">CHROMIS.</p>

<p>But is not that head-dress something particular? None of our
modern beauties ever dress so.</p>

<p class="center">MNASYLUS.</p>

<p>That may be; but the air is very careless and becoming notwithstanding.
How curiously some hairs are parted all before!&mdash;How 
gracefully some locks hang curling on each side; whilst a
gay riband binds the rest behind!</p>

<p class="center">CHROMIS.</p>

<p>Your opinion of the drapery.&mdash;Why, pray, so many folds?</p>

<p class="center">MNASYLUS.</p>

<p>Oh!&mdash;'tis &agrave;-la-neglig&eacute;e.&mdash;A girdle, you see, tucks up her gown,
that she may trace the grove with greater freedom: the loose,
flowing drapery is much more graceful than a formal dress.&mdash;One
would almost imagine, that the statuary had softened the very marble, 
the plaits are so natural.&mdash;If you observe, there are some parts
visibly naked through the veil. The softness of the flesh, added to

<!-- page 82 -->

the beauty of the drapery, strikes the eye at once, and makes the
whole a ravishing performance.</p>

<p class="center">CHROMIS.</p>

<p>Ho, ho! I find your affect taste.&mdash;You talk like an artist.&mdash;But
pray tell me, since you are such a critic, was that cornucopi&aelig; plucked
by <i>Alcides</i> from the head of <i>Achel&ouml;us</i>, or was it <i>Amalth&aelig;a</i>'s, the
famed nurse of <i>Jove?</i></p>

<p class="center">MNASYLUS.</p>

<h3>CHARACTER.</h3>

<h3>The SELF-TORMENTOR.</h3>

</div>

<p>WHY sits <i>Melanthus</i> thus dejected and forlorn? No real, but
imaginary ills torment him. His affairs move smoothly
on; his friends all study to oblige him. Why then,&mdash;why puts he
on this melancholy gloom? last night he went to bed the darling
of mankind; but when he rose, a trifle discomposed him; the
morning lowered, and heavily brought on the day; all around him
were in pain.</p>

<p>Now his friends blush for shame. They must conceal 
him: his mind's all dark and gloomy, filled with imaginary
fears. He sighs, and like an infant weeps; with horror like a lion
roars. A melancholy cloud darkens his understanding: ink is not
blacker than his thought.</p>

<p>Talk not to him of any thing he values
most in life; for what he so admires is in a moment the object of
his scorn and hatred. His boon companions, who, but the day
before, were favourite friends, are now grown tedious, and he resolves
to shake them off forever. He seeks all occasions to contradict, 
to make complaints, to exasperate all about him; then frets
that his resentments don't provoke them. Sometimes, with his
clenched fists, he beats the empty air; as, with his goring horns,

<!-- page 84 -->

the bull runs furious, and combats with the winds.</p>

<p>When he
wants a proper opportunity to rail at others, he directs his discourse
to himself, blames his own ill-conduct, calls himself worthless
coxcomb, sits down disconsolate, and takes it ill if you attempt to
pity, or redress him. One moment he would be alone; the next,
retirement is insupportable.</p>

<p>He seeks his company again; again
is churlish, and ill-natured. If they don't talk, their silence is affected 
and offensive. If they whisper, he listens with a jealous ear.
If they discourse too loud, they talk too much, and are too gay and
airy. If dull and pensive, he thinks it a tacit reflection on himself. 
If they laugh, he imagines that his conduct is the subject of
their ridicule.</p>

<p>What must be done?&mdash;Be as patient, as he is impertinent, 
and wait, in friendly hope, he'll be again to-day, as prudent 
as he was the day before. This unaccountable humour ebbs
and flows; when it affects him, it may properly be called the spring
of a machine that will soon fall to pieces. Just so, we should describe 
a man, tormented with a devil; reason is turned the wrong
side outward. 'Tis folly's master-piece.</p>

<p>Make the experiment.
You may persuade him that 'tis night, when the sun shines in his
full glory; for night and day are equally the same to an imagination
so ruffled and disturbed. Sometimes, he'll reflect with admiration
on his excess of humour; and smile amidst his gloomy thoughts at
his egregious flights.</p>

<p>But how shall we prevent these outrages of
nature, and allay the rising storm?&mdash;It is not in the power of art.
We have no almanac extant to settle such precarious weather.
Be cautious how you say, "to-morrow we'll divert ourselves in such
or such a garden;" the man to-morrow is another creature.</p>

<p>That
which he engages to perform one moment, is the next forgot; 'tis
to no purpose to remind him of his verbal promise. But instead,

<!-- page 85 -->

you'll find an unaccountable somewhat, which neither has, nor can
have any proper name or form, and is impossible to be defined, like
<i>Proteus</i> ever changing.</p>

<p>Study him well; then pass your judgment.
In a moment he'll be the same he was before. This fickle humour
will, and will not; he plays the bully and the coward; mingles
the most savage insults with the vilest and most low submissions.
He plays the merry Andrew, weeps, smiles, and, raves; and in those
fits is most extravagant. He is diverting, florid, artificial, full of
evasions, without one ray of reason.</p>

<p>Never tell him he is not just,
punctual, or a man of judgment: he'll surely take the advantage,
and retort upon you. He'll resign his folly, and resume the man of
sense, for the mere satisfaction of convincing you, that you are
otherwise. Like a bubble, blown up in the air, his reason's in a
moment lost, and never heard of more.</p>

<p>He never knows the real
cause of his displeasure; he only knows that he is, and will be displeased; 
nay, sometimes he scarce knows even that. He imagines
oftentimes, that his friends who talk with him are warm; whilst
he alone is cool. He's like a man afflicted with the jaundice, who
fancies every object in his view is yellow; though that colour is only
in his own eyes, and the effect of his distemper.</p>

<p>However, are
there no persons whom he peculiarly regards, who are his favourite
friends?&mdash;No! his caprice yields to none; all feel the effects of it
alike. He vents his passion on the first that comes; friends and
foes are all the fame, in case he can but gratify his humour. He'll
cast his vile reflections on the very persons to whom he lies under
the greatest obligations. He despises their friendship. They
slight him, dun him, blast his character; he values no man living.</p>

<p>Have patience but a moment, and the scene is changed. He thinks
himself obliged to all mankind; he respects them; they regard
him; he fawns and flatters; they, who before thought ill of him,

<!-- page 86 -->

are charmed with his address. He freely owns his accusations all
unjust, laughs at his follies, and acts them in ridicule all over again
so naturally, you'd think him in the wildest transports. After this
farce is over, at his own expense, you might well imagine he'd
never personate the humourist more.&mdash;Alas! you are deceived:&mdash;he 
will be mad as ever to-night in very purpose&mdash;to laugh his folly
over again to-morrow.</p>
