</div>

<p>THE preface to a new book is usually radiant with words
of Gladness and Hope. This must be one of privilege and
sorrow.</p>

<p>The brain that conceived, and the hand that penned the
"SLAVE OF THE LAMP," are now mouldering beneath the
turf in Greenwood Cemetery.</p>

<p>On the 14th of November, 1854, the author of this
volume was found in his chamber, a corpse.  A bottle
standing on the table&mdash;beside the last pages of this novel&mdash;indicated
too sadly how he had left the world. The coroner
called it death by Prussic acid; death by disappointment
would have been the better verdict. He bade farewell to
his friends in rapid interviews preceding the event. Others
whom he could not see he wrote to, lovingly and kindly.
Whilst with one hand he clutched the boney fingers of death,
the other was extended in Friendship. He died not madly,
but calmly in sorrow, in disappointment, and in poverty.</p>

<p>Known since his early manhood to the British public as a
writer of considerable talent, WILLIAM NORTH arrived in this
country only some two years ago, his soul glowing with an
ardent but strangely erratic love of liberty, and his wild
dreams with regard to this sentiment, he fondly hoped to
find realized in America. He was connected by the
ties of consanguinity with the Guildford family, one of
his ancestors being Lord North, Earl of Guildford, who
figured prominently in England, during the period of the
American Revolution.  His strong democratic feelings,
estranged him from his family connections at home, and
from his nineteenth to his twenty-eighth year, he appears to
have led a strangely isolated life, although (during this
period,) he contributed largely to the English periodicals,
his productions exciting much attention and curiosity, as much
from the originality of his genius, as on account of his
strangely mystical style. Before he had completed his
twentieth year, he wrote and published a political novel,
entitled, "ANTI-CONINGSBY," in refutation of D'Israeli's
"Coningsby." This novel, although the production of so
young a man, is perhaps the most forcible of all his
works.</p>

<p>It may be supposed that Mr. North derived considerable
pecuniary emolument from this work, which at that early
age, established his fame as an author. Whether he did, or
not, we cannot say. At this period of his life, however,
money was a secondary object with him. He was possessed
of some property in his own right, but with the proverbial
indiscretion of men of his peculiar temperament,  this was
soon squandered, lent, or given away.</p>

<p>Although he published numerous books in England, and
was connected with various popular periodicals, at different
times, he does not appear to have reaped much pecuniary
benefit from his labors.  His productions were highly
prized by such as could understand, and sympathize with
the feelings of the author; but his style was too strongly
embued with German metaphysics to become popular with
the majority of readers.</p>

<p>He had been educated in a German university, and his
mind had become morbidly impressed with the peculiar
doctrines, inculcated in those places of education.</p>

<p>After struggling with adverse circumstances for many
years in England, he came, as we have stated, about two
years ago, to this country, and upon his arrival, immediately
sought literary employment.  He was successful, and at
different times, contributed largely to various periodicals.
In Harper's Magazine, a story from his pen appeared,
entitled "The Usurer's Gift." In the Knickerbocker,
"Blondine," "Brunette," "My Ghost," and "The Man
that Married his Grandmother," and in Graham's Magazine,
a tale, entitled the "Phantom World.". He wrote also for
the Whig Review, and other periodicals; and at Burton's
Theatre, brought out a farce called "The Automaton Man,"
which was highly successful. All this literary labor was
accomplished while Mr. North was also engaged as a writer
for the public press; but it appears that his pecuniary success
was not equal to  his anticipations, notwithstanding the
popularity of his contributions. The pressure, not perhaps
of actual poverty, but of continuous necessity, added to the
mental distress consequent upon an hopeless attachment,
proved too much for his singularly sensitive nature. He
had peculiar notions of suicide, the result partially, of his
early education; and at length, impelled perhaps by a
morbid sensitiveness, he released his spirit from its mortal
bondage, and dismissed it into that eternal world, which had
so long been the subject of its mystic broodings.</p>

<p>In a letter now before us, written by Mr. North the day
before he committed the fearful act, occurs the following
passage. He is lamenting the failure of one of his fondest
hopes, and observes&mdash;</p>

<p>"An inseparable barrier existed between us. What was
left to me? I had seen Paradise: the portals were eternally
closed to me. I could but die.</p>

<p>"To me&mdash;philosopher and poet, of a school yet in its
infancy; the school of passional, intellectual, and moral
harmony&mdash;the idea was natural. I never feared death."</p>

<p>In another letter, having special allusion to this his last
novel, he says&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have written what I believed it best to write, and what
I believed, myself, I could write best.</p>

<p>"Such as my work is, I commend it more especially to
the young and true-hearted sons of America. I am neither a
Bulwer nor a Dickens, yet, in one respect, I feel myself
to enjoy an advantage over either&mdash;I live in a free country.
It is only in an atmosphere of freedom, that we can indeed
think freely, as freely, as I, the poor, weary literary adventurer
have taken the liberty of writing; and the history of
A Slave of the Lamp, despising humbug and owning a yet
unshaken faith in the heroic and the beautiful; may not
appear <i>mal-apropos</i>."</p>

<p>With a few unavoidable exceptions the characters in this
book have originals in real life. The strong appeals&mdash;with
which it abounds&mdash;for the <i>literateur</i> and the inventor, have
been elicited by a personal knowledge of the miseries, humiliations,
and hardships those ennoblers of a country have to
endure. Neglect too often, and in all countries, is a condition
of genius. The absence of proper legal protection
makes it peculiarly irksome here.  Mr. North's memory
will be respected for the able manner in which has urged
this neglected fact in the present novel.</p>

<p>In works of an autobiographical character the hero is
generally (rightly or not), associated in some indescribable
way with the author. In the character of Dudley Mondel,
Mr. North undoubtedly gives us glimpses of himself, but not
sufficiently to make author and hero identical. It is hard to
find a hero in broadcloth, and to himself a man never seems
heroical. The best among us would need the heightening
touch of the romancist to be attractive from the cold pages
of a book.  Whilst therefore, there is much curious thought
that may be traced to the idiosyncrasy of William North,
the reader is requested to remember that there is more
mere personality that owes its origin purely to the fictitious
Dudley Mondel. In the <a href="#c25">incidental memoirs</a> of the hero,
Mr. North undoubtedly speaks mostly of himself
and his family. That section of the present work will
be found of no ordinary character. Simply as a work of art
it is remarkable. For pureness of style, elegance of diction,
and force of thought, it has seldom, if ever, been surpassed.</p>

<p>It will not escape the careful reader, that this novel is
eminently thoughtful. William North was essentially a
thinker, and like other thinkers on abstract matters, was not
always right. There is much profitable reading in this
volume, and of a kind not often found in novels. Many of
the ideas are of startling boldness, particularly those relating
to the inventions and progress of the future. In the latter
part of the work, however, there are some theological
speculations which bear their own extravagance on the face
of them. As a whole, this last prose work is no unworthy
offering to America. It breathes throughout the national
sentiment, and without being gaseous, is patriotic in the best
sense of the word. It is also sincere, written perhaps, in
excitement, but the excitement of doing good.</p>

<h2>THE SLAVE OF THE LAMP.</h2>

<h3>BOOK I.</h3>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p id="c01">CHAPTER I.</p>

<p>UNDERGROUND.</p>

</div>

<p>NOT far from the celebrated <i>Tombs</i>&mdash;a modern
Egyptian temple devoted to the custody of New York
law-breakers&mdash;down a street chief remarkable for
the irregularity of its pavement and the poverty of
its inhabitants, three men were eating oysters in a
cellar.</p>

<p>In the city alluded to&mdash;a city of which, probably,
many of my readers have heard&mdash;oyster eating is
mostly a subterranean process.</p>

<p>Whether the consumption of that particular shell-fish
is considered too mysterious and awful a ceremony
to be carried on universally in broad daylight, or
whether oysters are supposed to taste better by gaslight
than in the glare of sunshine, we know not;
we can only testify to the fact, and record it for the
instruction of future ages. Cellars and oysters are, in
New York, like the ex-republic of France, one and
indivisible. Those who profanely eat oysters above
ground feel the proceeding to be, at best, inconsistent
and unsatisfactory. The oyster is naturally a thing
of darkness. Oysters were evidently not created to
be looked at, but to be swallowed with the faith of
unwavering fanaticism and "no questions asked."
Even to this day, after eight and twenty years sad
experience of the world and its fishes, I swallow a raw
oyster with a strange mingling of horror and appetite&mdash;such
as, I fancy, I should feel if taken prisoner in
Africa, and forced to marry the Queen of the Hottentots
under penalty of being immediately given to her
majesty's pet boa-constrictor for supper.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, in that same city of New York,
oysters and theatrical criticism are supposed to go
together; and the critic, like the oyster, is thought to
prefer to all other resorts, the semi-obscurity and
mystery of a restaurant-catacomb for the preparation
of those shadowy accusations, which he is for ever
throwing, like the Venetians of old, into the open
lion's mouth of a theatre-going and oyster-eating
public.</p>

<p>But the three men, of whom I am about to speak,
were no oyster critics, except in the plain and
unpoetical sense of simple critics of oysters. Neither
was the subterranean saloon (or, as its frequenters
classically termed it, "the dive") in which they were
seated by any means one of those luxurious establishments
with which many of my male readers are
familiar. No splendid carved and gilded bar was
there, glittering, like a diamond necklace, with crystal
bottles and glasses, and lumps of ice plunged into
ruby and amber drinks, relieved by dripping tufts of
emerald mint. No velvet-cushioned boxes, in which,
as in a private cave, snug parties of convivialists are
protected by curtains and blind from the curiosity of
stray outsiders. No well-dressed loungers, no gas, no
mirrors were there. It was a place in which three
men were rudely eating oysters by the dubious light of
a three-wicked pewter camphene lamp, in a straightforward
unpretending manner, each one opening for
himself, and leaving his companions to do the same.
In a word, it was a cheap edition of liberty hall, if ever
such a hall existed, or could be imagined to exist, in
the shape of a cellar, with a ceiling smoked as black as
General Cass's old hat (lately exhibited at a hatter's
in Fourth Street, Cincinnati, corner of Main Street, as
I can personally testify), and with an extemporised
table, and three rascally old cane-bottomed chairs for
furniture.</p>

<p>The table, which was supported by three small
casks, and notched at the edge like a saw, haying
been originally a door, was remarkably solid its
construction. This table, or ex-door, supported by
way of centre-piece the basket of oysters from which
the three <i>bons vivants</i> were helping themselves,
pleasantly throwing the shells on the floor, and dipping
their oysters into the saucers of salt and red
pepper, with a disregard of etiquette, as natural as it
was congenial. On the fourth or unoccupied side of
the table stood, like so many soldiers, a double row
of bottles, containing Philadelphia ale and porter in
equal measure. A large paper of quadrangular
crackers, torn open for convenience of access at both
ends, completed the festive arrangements. And now,
having set the table, I shall at once proceed to introduce
the guests, who may, perhaps, prove more interesting
company than oysters, which are proverbially
mute, and, moreover, according to naturalists, creatures
on the very lowest steps of the great spiral staircase
of creative development.</p>

<p>From oysters, then, we proceed naturally to the
eaters of oysters.</p>

<p>Now the three oyster-eaters in question, were by
no means the sort of people a respectable clergyman
would select as intimate friends, or a wealthy merchant
be apt to choose as partners in business, nor
could they in any light be, strictly speaking, regarded
as very eligible acquaintances. Still they were "men
and brothers," and would have been fellow-Christians
had they believed in any religion at all.</p>

<p>Possibly the reader never heard of them. As,
however, I abominate clap-trap and humbug in literature
as in life, I shall at once and unaffectedly state
that these three obscure celebrities were neither more
nor less than those, to their own set illustrious, vagabonds,
known by the initiated as&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Confidence Bob.</p>

<p>2. The Slinker.</p>

<p>3. The Perfessor, or professor (the former pronunciation
was the more fashionable amongst his friends,
though, on the score of orthography, perhaps objectionable).</p>

<p>Confidence Bob, or, as he otherwise styled himself,
Mr. Robert Mombcross&mdash;probably a lineal descendant
of the impenitent thief&mdash;was a well-shaven personage
with dark curling hair, a round, good-tempered
face, very black eyes, and a costume consisting
of a very short blue coat (of which he facetiously
observed that it would be long enough before he got
another), a pair of fashionable crossbarred pantaloons,
and a maroon-colored satin waistcoat with gilt buttons,
altogether, in the eyes of the general public,
"considerable of a swell." He had new and very
highly varnished shoes, copies of which may be
obtained for the sum of one dollar and fifty cents, in
Greenwich street or the Bowery. He had also a
very shiny shirt-collar (glazed with gum), which in
fact he had purchased, with a view to appearances,
that very afternoon at a hosier's near the corner of
Fulton street.</p>

<p>This charming cavalier, who (in his own opinion)
was "got up" somewhat in the style of the London
and Parisian aristocracy, showed great science in
knocking off the necks of the ale bottles with his
knife, just as a Turkish executioner is supposed, by
students of the "Arabian Nights," and other great
Oriental authorities, to behead a fated prisoner at one
blow of his glittering Damascus sabre.</p>

<p>The absence of such trifling luxuries as corkscrews
and tumblers, rendered this a useful accomplishment
under the circumstances.</p>

<p>The Slinker, who, if he had any other name, baptismal
or genealogical, never could get any of his
friends to acknowledge it, was a little thin starveling
man, with small eyes, red hair, and a nose like the
beak of a sparrow. He swallowed his oysters in a
stealthy and voracious manner, as if to make sure of
his portion, and seemed to observe his companions
with a timidly suspicious air; more especially he
glanced with an imploring sense of inferiority towards
the Professor, who, in return, regarded the Slinker
with a contemptuous patronage, worthy of a great
tragedian, or a modern military despot.</p>

<p>The Slinker's attire commenced with a greasy,
napless hat, worn, like the famous falling tower of
Pisa, at a considerable incline from the perpendicular.
Next came, undivided by even the narrowest
parapet of linen, a dirty blue silk handkerchief
with yellow spots, followed by a black dress coat of
the last year but twenty's fashion, which showed
strong signs of having been prematurely brushed to
death in its youth. It was a threadbare old corpse
of a coat, and the eye was refreshed by escaping
from its contemplation to that of his trowsers, which
were of a pea-green color faded to a grassy yellow.
These failed utterly to meet his shoes, split equally
over the little toes, and as innocent of blacking as
the paws of a polar bear. His hands were long,
venous, and bony, resembling the claws of some
queer bird, whilst his complexion was of a brownish
yellow, with a sprinkling of brick-dust on the cheeks
and nose. The cuffs of his coat, and indeed his dress
generally, were here and there stained with tobacco-juice.
Taken altogether, he would have cut rather a
queer figure at a fashionable party.</p>

<p>The Professor, sometimes called Jack Rivers on
the covers of epistolary communications, was a man
of a very different stamp. He was broad-shouldered,
deep-chested, with a head like a low-browed and
brutal Napoleon, iron-jawed, long-armed, short-legged,
yet of fully medium stature. His complexion
was bronzed and coppered almost to the hue of an
Indian's. His eyes were of a greenish hazel, that
flashed animal courage and latent ferocity. Such
was the man who sat there, at once the admiration and
terror of his two weaker comrades.</p>

<p>In man, as shown by Lavater, re-appear the types
of all other animals. We involuntarily associate one
man with the fox, and one with the sheep, another
with the tiger, a fourth with the goat. I have frequently
seen very pretty girls who irresistibly reminded
me of greyhounds, cats, sparrows, or kangaroos.</p>

<p>The Professor was of the lion genus. Although of
European birth, he might have been compared to the
supple black lion of South America; Confidence
Bob was more like a large black dog; and the Slinker
was evidently a carrion crow, with a dash of the
jackal in his composition.</p>

<p>A Brahmin&mdash;and who knows but what I am a disciple
of the Vedas myself&mdash;would have given good
reasons for these fanciful resemblances.</p>

<p>"Well, Slinker," said the Professor, throwing his
last oyster-shell over his shoulder, and decapitating a
bottle of porter with even greater dexterity than Mr.
Mombcross (alias Confidence Bob), "How's  trade?"</p>

<p>"Werry poor;" said the Slinker, in a whining
voice like a whipt cat's, looking all the while at the
oyster-shells on the floor as if in search of pearls,
"werry poor, honly vun shorl, two boys' clokes (vurth
nex' ter nuffin), and ahimitation bamboo valkin stick
with a gilt 'ed. The 'all lurk is a gitten ter be a
werry hunprofiterbul bisnis. People locks their
parlers, and gents gits shy of 'angin up their coats
down stairs in the 'alls. Humberellers is a drug
now as the vinter's hover, and valkin canes with gold
'eds is gone houter fashun."</p>

<p>"Nothing else?" said the Professor, to whom this
strange dialect of the native cockney was perfectly
familiar.</p>

<p>"Nuffin, s'elp me baccy?"</p>

<p>"Means Bacchus, Slinker does," remarked Confidence
Bob, as if making the explanation for his own
private satisfaction, and by no means with any vain
idea of imparting useful information to his companions.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, Confidence," said the Professor,
fixing his keen eyes upon the Blinker, "if he aint
lying at this particular date, he's at any rate prevaricating
like a corkscrew. Why don't he look a cove
in the mug when he cants? why, because he's a galvanized
squirt, and as the parson said, the truth aint
in him."</p>

<p>"There's not room for it," said Confidence Bob,
"he's so darned thin! Besides he's the only son of
the man who told a lie the fust words he spoke, and
never spoke another afterwards!"</p>

<p>"You're hollers at me with yer stoopid Yankee
jokes;" muttered the Slinker, looking angrily at Bob,
and appealingly towards the Professor. "I vish <i>hi'd</i>
never hemmergrated to this 'ere beast of a country,
I do by&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you go to blazes!" said the Professor, with a
broad grin; "you know very well you only cut London
because you were so well known to the peelers
you didn't dare to stop. What a pity you didn't
learn English before you left. They don't understand
the cockney lingo here."</p>

<p>"I vish I 'ad your edication, Perfessor," said the
Slinker, with mock humility.</p>

<p>"Education, indeed!" growled the Professor. "A
nice education I had, and a nice position it has given
me!"</p>

<p>"Learning to sign one's name," observed Confidence
Bob, sentimentally, "too often leads to a
fellow's signing somebody else's. It is the first step
that counts, as I've heard say in French, though I
can't recollect the exact <i>European</i> of it at the
moment."</p>

<p>"Now, Slinker," resumed the Professor, whilst Confidence
Bob playfully made a lunge at that gentleman
with an oyster-knife, thereby causing him to collapse
in sudden terror; "now, Slinker, what else did
you do to-day?</p>

<p>"Nuffin, Perfessor," said the Slinker, again
intently studying the saucer of red pepper.</p>

<p>"Don't chaff <i>me</i>, Slinker," growled his pitiless
interrogator. "Do you think I don't read your
miserable soul like a four-yard poster? What else
did you do? I say, and remember I'm in a hurry!"</p>

<p>"Out with it, old bird! don't chaff the Professor,"
put in Confidence. "What we want is <i>facts</i>, which,
according to scholars, are the foundation of all real
scientific information."</p>

<p>"Well," said the much oppressed Slinker, who,
under the eye of the Professor, was like a bird magnetised
by a serpent&mdash;"I got <i>these</i>;"  and he reluctantly
extended a bunch of keys, with a strong steel
ring, to the Professor.</p>

<p>"Where from?"</p>

<p>"Sixteenth street."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"From a coat pocket."</p>

<p>"Whose?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Simpkins, the broker's."</p>

<p>"What did you mean to do with them? Wait for
the reward in the advertisement, eh?"</p>

<p>The Slinker's downcast eyes seemed tacitly
to admit that he had been guilty of the meanness of
contemplating that course of action.</p>

<p>"Humph! a rich broker's?" muttered the Professor,
playing with the keys, and apparently engaged in
some profoundly important calculation.</p>

<p>"You surely don't think of&mdash;of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of business again?" broke in Bob.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no," said the Professor, as if reluctantly
giving up a pleasant scheme; "no, I will not be
tempted. I mean to give up the line."  And Mr.
John Rivers disdainfully threw back the bunch of
keys to the Slinker, who eagerly thrust them into his
pocket.</p>

<p>"To give it up!" exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>"Give it up!" whined the Slinker.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Professor, "I've seen the inside
of more stone jugs than one, and made a trip to Australia
once at the Queen of England's particular
request, and at the British Government's expense. In
my time, and I'm now close on forty, I've introduced
myself into more first-rate houses than I can well
recollect, and done business in more towns than I
want to count, and I'm getting pretty tired of risking
my life for a few bits of yellow, and skulking about
the streets, like a dog that has lost its master. <i>Here</i>
I'm not known yet. I've done little, and never been
nabbed. So I think whilst there's time I'll turn over
a new leaf, and <i>reform</i>.  That's what I mean to do;
and I advise you two to do the same, and go in for
something that's gentlemanly and respectable, at
once."</p>

<p>"Reform, guv'ner?" squeaked the Slinker, in an
almost inaudible tone.</p>

<p>"Reform?" queried Confidence, in equal amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes, reform, by G&mdash;&mdash;!" reiterated the Professor,
coolly. "Now, mark me, you, Confidence, and you,
Slinker! I'm going to make you partners in the speculation;
but, by the Eternal! if either of you are
caught and peach, and you are to be shot in the very
cells of Sing Sing, it will be done. You are dealing
with two men who stand no nonsense, and forgive no
weakness. You know <i>me!</i>"</p>

<p>"And the other," said Confidence Bob, suspiciously,
"who is your friend?"</p>

<p>"Yes, who is he?" snivelled the obsequious Slinker,
like an ill-conditioned echo.</p>

<p>"Our master&mdash;a <i>real</i> boss and no mistake!" replied
the Professor, with impressive emphasis; "the professor
of pugilism and house-breaking in all their
branches."</p>

<p>At this moment, there was a single, heavy, dull
knock at the door of the cellar.</p>

<p>"There he is!" said the Professor, with a start.
"Mind, he does not relish joking, so treat him like a
gentleman&mdash;do you hear?"</p>

<p>"But, who <i>is</i> he?" again asked Confidence,
curiously.</p>

<p>"He is the&mdash;ALTERER!" replied the Professor,
beginning to unbar the door at a second impatient
summons of his visitor.</p>

<p>"The Devil!" exclaimed Confidence, who seemed
wonderfully impressed by the strange cognomen.</p>

<p>"A near relative," muttered the Professor, "and
that's a fact."</p>

<p>As for the Slinker, he felt very much like a fifteenth-rate
poet about to be introduced to Alfred Tennyson,
or M. de Lamartine; or like an unpaid  <i>attach&eacute;</i> on the
verge of a presentation to Lord Palmerston, or
Prince Metternich.</p>

<p>By this time, the Professor had opened the door,
and admitted a man in black, with a pale, thin face,
and eyes that glittered like two stars, not with actual
light, but with that redundant electric vitality, which
at once makes itself felt by those on whom it rests, as
the indications of an internal force of which it is the
sign and the manifestation.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Professor," said the stranger.
"Gentlemen, good evening. I drink to our better
acquaintance!" And, calmly taking one of the bottles,
the mysterious new comer, at one blow against
the edge of the table, removed its neck, and, to the
intense admiration of the three spectators of the feat,
drank up its contents at a draught. "And now to
business," he resumed "You are all rich men, if
true to me, and dead men, if you betray me;" and,
placing his hand in his bosom, the outline of a
revolver became visible, at which the Professor alone
glanced with a smile of sincere and sympathetic
satisfaction.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p id="c02">CHAPTER II.</p>

<p>LUCIFER.</p>

</div>

<p>"TAKE a chair, Mr.&mdash;&mdash; Mr.&mdash;?" Confidence Bob
paused interrogatively.</p>

<p>"LUCIFER," said the stranger sharply, "if you
needs must have a name;" and he bent a searching
glance upon the questioner, which made that self-possessed
personage feel a momentary doubt whether
or not the devil had not sought an interview with
him in reality.</p>

<p>"Lucifer?" echoed the Slinker with involuntary
amazement, "Lucifer?"</p>

<p>"One name is as good as another;" said the
Alterer, with sudden calmness; "and Lucifer will
suit me as well as any."</p>

<p>"Better," said the Professor; "for the Prince of
Darkness himself would have to knock under to you
in the </i>altering</i> business!"</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> shall be my prime minister," said Lucifer,
turning his pale face and flashing eyes towards the
Professor, with a grim approval of his flattery, "and
these gentlemen your secretaries. In my character
as an infernal potentate, I shall necessarily appear but
rarely; To you, therefore, Professor, I shall entrust
full powers, and with you alone, except on special
occasions, I shall communicate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what are we to do? what's it all about? how
do you know that I shall go into it?" said Confidence
Bob, sulkily, determined to show his very distinct
appreciation of his own personal importance to the
stranger</P>

<p>The Slinker looked an echo to these queries. Further
he dared not go, so deeply was he impressed by the
stern and resolute aspect of the Alterer.</p>

<p>"Do they know who I am?" said Lucifer; again
looking sharply into the eyes of his introducer.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Professor, "I have told them that
you&mdash;the Alterer."</p>

<p>"Good!" said the stranger, taking out a pocket-book,
from which he extracted three rolls of bankbills,
which he handed politely to the three men respectively.
"Now my friends," said he, "examine those
bills, keep those which are good, return me the bad.
Take your time, look at them well, there is no hurry."</p>

<p>"I guess the whole pile are bogus," muttered
Confidence Bob, as he turned over his roll.</p>

<p>"These is good, at any rate," said the Sinker,
"has for the rest, they are Indiana money, and I don't
much like their looks, tho' they is uncommon well
got up, by Jingo they is!"</p>

<p>"What do <i>you</i> say, Mr. Rivers?"</p>

<p>"Well," said the Professor, "I confess I'm bothered,
there ain't a bill in my hand, I would not have taken
of any one, and yet, I suppose some of 'em are
rum uns; but I can't distinguish, and that's a fact. I
give it up, as the boy said to the riddle about the
door that wasn't a door; I'm cust if I can twig a screw
loose anywhere, though I've pretty sharp eyes too for
the scrieving dodges!"</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Lucifer, "you are at least wise
enough to know your own ignorance. As for <i>your</i>
opinion," he continued, addressing Confidence Bob,
"it so happens, that out of the ten bills you hold, five
are genuine, and five altered. In the third lot (and
he turned to the Slinker), it chances, that precisely the
Indiana money you object to, is the only good paper
in your hands. Professor," he continued triumphantly,
"<i>all</i> the bills <i>you</i> have examined, are from my workshop.
So much for the judgment of three flash men,
supposed to know the ropes as well as any in New
York. Now, what do you say to business. My
terms are one dollar in five, cash down, and death
to traitors." At these words, the stranger looked
steadily for a few seconds at Confidence Bob and the
Slinker alternately, until even the former's impudence
yielded, and his eyes fell before the resolute
and inquisitorial gaze of his scrutinizer. "By following
my instructions, detection is almost impossible,"
completed the Alterer, with a smile of
unexpected amiability. "Once a fortnight I will meet
you, or at any rate, Mr. Rivers, to keep up the
supplies&mdash;&mdash;. For the present, here are three
hundred bankable bills, real money, redeemable at
par, to set you afloat as respectable citizens. By
to-morrow night, the Professor will bring you my
instructions. One word before parting; should you
meet me anywhere, under any circumstances, <i>we are
strangers</i>&mdash;a look of recognition will be regarded by
me as a premeditated treachery. Good night!"</p>

<p>And making an amicable sign to the Professor with his
hand, the mysterious stranger departed, without
further words, leaving the two subordinate rascals
in a state of utter astonishment and confusion of
ideas.</p>

<p>Every class of crime has its peculiar horror; and,
to the illiterate rogue, the man who uses the <i>pen</i> as
his instrument, inspires a more irresistible feeling of
awe, than the most daring burglar and the most
adventurous highwayman.</p>

<p>"Ain't he a stunner?" exclaimed the Professor,
enthusiastically, as soon as the door had fairly closed
upon the retiring figure of the stranger.</p>

<p>"Won't we live? that's all!" cried the Confidence
man suddenly, seeing open before him an existence
of hitherto undreamed-of luxury.</p>

<p>"Hain't it wery 'azardous?" suggested the Slinker
timidly, feeling somewhat like a small fly just caught
in the web of a huge spider.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! Lucifer's a jolly devil in his way;" said
the Professor laughing, "and passing a queer bill is
no great matter, specially when you have a good one
in your pocket to fork out if it's questioned.
And now, good night; I expect Sal's tired of waiting for
me; you sleep here, don't you Slinker? What are
you going to do, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Stroll up to the Astor," said the Confidence man
easily; "and see if I can't catch a flat from the country,
at any rate, I'll"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't humbug <i>me</i>," said the Professor, "I know
where you'll go, safe enough&mdash;take care of your
money, that's all;" and so saying, the three worthies
separated, as we too, not unwillingly, shall separate
from them for the present.</p>

<p id="c03">CHAPTER III.</p>

<p>ABOVE GROUND.</p>

</div>

<p>THE house of  Mr.  Harrison B. Yonkers was in the
best part of the Fifth Avenue, that is, in the very best
part of New York.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Fifth Avenue has been called by strangers,
a street of palaces, and is not surpassed by
even the handsomest line of villa-residences in the
suburbs of London. Continental towns have nothing
of the kind to show, and assuredly no other dwelling-street
in any American city can rival its elegance and
substantial magnificence.</p>

<p>The house of Mr. Harrison B. Yonkers was built in
the native "know-nothing," or conglomerate, style of
architecture. It gloried in a Greek portico, Gothic
windows, and Moorish pinnacles. It was faced with
brown-stone&mdash;done brown, as the masons facetiously
say&mdash;and had an open-work stone wall, like pie-crust,
before it. The entrance was reached, through a small
garden, by a broad flight of marble steps. On each
side of these steps, tail in air, with open mouth, and
lustreless eyes stood sentinel, a huge bronze lion. Own
brothers of these same leonine twins, mount guard at
the doors of Mrs. Peterson Jones and Mr. Lundy
Smith. No lion was ever more popular, not even
Eleazar Williams, King of France, and Emperor of
"Putnam's Monthly." The man who has the mould,
says it is the most philoprogenitive lion he ever
caught, and he would not take five thousand dollars
for it.</p>

<p>As to the interior comforts of the house of Mr.
Harrison B. Yonkers (B. stands for Benjamin, but he
was always called Harrison B.), it had, in advertising
phrase, all the modern improvements&mdash;gas, baths,
gutta-percha telegraphs, and so forth. Its furniture
was in a style of exaggerated splendor, though far
from vulgar in taste. Mr. Harrison B. had married,
for the second time, at the age of forty-eight, a beautiful
young lady precisely half his age&mdash;decidedly
the better half&mdash;that is, four and twenty, and she naturally
expected a great deal.</p>

<p>In this world life is a trade, and most earthly transactions
bargains. Much bogus coin and wild-cat-cum-red-dog
bills are in circulation; but, as a general
principle, "shin plasters" are regarded cautiously;
and nothing is given for nothing. He who has no
capital realizes the <i>ex nihilo nihil fit</i> axiom infallibly.
But money is not the only capital. Miss Amelia
Luton gave youth, beauty, accomplishments, in
exchange for dulness, middle age, and wealth. She
had no idea of being cheated out of her equivalent
for what she justly considered an "awful sacrifice."
In the South, pretty colored ladies are sold by the
slave-dealer; in the North, pretty white ladies sell
themselves directly. Perhaps, so long as poverty
shall be the greatest curse of life, unequal marriages
and prostitution will continue to desolate society, and
change the harmony of human nature into discord.</p>

<p>Amelia Luton, like many others, imagined that of
two evils, she chose the least. To live in a palace, to
dress like a princess, to receive her guests with superb
hospitality, were now supposed necessities of her
existence.</p>

<p>To do her justice, she would not have sold herself
for these considerations alone, had any of the men
she encountered as a spinster succeeded in touching
her heart. But none succeeded in the task, for she
expected much. She was a woman of strong mind
and ardent feelings. She had no fortune. Her
mother had an income which, like the Irishman's
story, wanted nothing but a beginning and an end,
except a middle, to make it perfect. In a blank
state of sentiment she exercised her judgment, and
married a rich widower; a man of money; a Wall
street potentate; a good-humored gentleman; with a
red face, iron-grey hair and whiskers, and a large,
portly figure, as became a man nominally worth a
million. Mr. Yonkers was a great man in Wall
street, but a very small one in Fifth Avenue; his wife
was supposed to be highly cultivated, and knew a
hundred things of which he had scarcely a dim conception.
What usually happened in such cases, happened
in this. Mrs. Yonkers having thrown herself
away, as she more than once sarcastically hinted, on
a heap of gold dust, was rendered suddenly alive to
the fact, that she had committed an irretrievable
blunder. Within eighteen months of her marriage,
she met, what some ladies poetical term, her destiny.
This destiny came in the shape of a man some twenty
years younger than her husband, and in her eyes the
very paragon of earthly perfection. This was the
gentleman who, on the evening following that of the
Alterer's enlistment of his mysterious recruits, sat in
pleasant conversation with Mrs. Yonkers, and her
daughter-in-law, Columbia, in the magnificent drawing-room
of her Fifth Avenue mansion.</p>

<p>He was a man nearly thirty years of age, tall, pale,
and of an imposing mien. His face wore an agreeable,
but sad expression, which might have seemed
still sadder, had not a dark-brown moustache and
beard almost concealed the line of his mouth, that
unfailing indication of the mind's interior condition.
What was particularly striking about this person, was
the steady gaze of his soft, inscrutable grey eyes.
When not resting on the faces of his companions,
they seemed to be looking forward into the future;
or, possibly, backwards into the past, in search of
fantasmal images, and scenery of mysterious interest.
He was evidently full of thought, though it might
have puzzled a phrenologist to determine the predominating
character of his reflections.</p>

<p>A lawyer might have taken him for a brother counsellor,
pondering over the intricacies of a cause about
to be tried on the following morning; a merchant
for a speculator in stocks, meditating a grand operation
in railway scrip; an author for a poet forming
the plot of a tragedy, or the plan of an epic.</p>

<p>Perhaps an acute man of the world would have
recognized in his countenance, calm and passionless
as it appeared; the indications of that painful perplexity
which a man feels who has plunged himself,
or been plunged by circumstances, or the conduct of
others, into a position of apparently inextricable
embarrassment.</p>

<p>He was seated on a sofa covered with blue
damask, so constructed that as he leaned back on one
of its ends, he partially faced a young lady of some
twenty to twenty-three years of age, who occupied a
like position at the other end of the sofa.</p>

<p>This young lady was Columbia Yonkers.</p>

<p>Precisely opposite that part of the sofa on which
the gentleman sat, and so near that their feet were
almost in contact, sat Mrs. Yonkers. She was dressed
in white, for it was summer weather, and white
well suited the rich creamy delicacy of her somewhat
dark complexion.</p>

<p>Her hair, almost black, was parted simply on the
smoothest of foreheads; and her large, dark, hazel eyes
were fixed languidly on the object of her
secret preference, whilst her strong, rounded, subtle
shape reposed motionlessly balanced in the rocking-chair&mdash;motionlessly;
yet, if I may venture on the
phrase, instinct with latent motion. There was
palpably a fund of life and animation in that tranquil
lady, which only awaited fitting occasion to exhibit
itself openly. Languidly as her eyes were fixed upon
her visitor's features, there was a strange intensity in
her look, which implied, perhaps, doubt, most
assuredly, watchfulness.</p>

<p>In truth, it was a strange comedy these three people
were playing. To look at the placid Columbia, with
her fine fair complexion, her slender, graceful, exquisitely
developed figure, and little white tapering hands
so innocently folded, as if in unconscious prayer; to
observe the calm gentleness of her large, long-lashed
blue eyes, half covered by their drooping delicate lids,
as they rested vaguely on her step-mother's countenance,
would have caused a stranger to see in her the
very type of happy girlish ignorance, and unimpassioned
womanhood. Yet were those soft blue eyes no
less vigilant than the bright dark orbs of the dark
beauty on whom they rested. Nor, impassible as he
appeared, was the companion of these two charming women
less closely observant of the slightest change
in the conventionally-governed features of either.</p>

<p>The conversation, as is common when thoughts that
cannot be uttered are within the hearts of the speakers,
turned upon the most trivial topics.</p>

<p>"The weather is unusually fine," said Columbia,
with an air of preoccupation and assumed <i>nonchalance</i>.</p>

<p>"A little cloudy," said the pale visitor, as if dreaming
of something or somebody in another world, or
another sphere, as the professional "spiritualists"
would phrase it.</p>

<p>"There will be a storm unless the clouds pass over,"
said Mrs. Yonkers, with a lazy sweetness, fixing her
eyes upon her <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>, to express the emphasis which
her tones avoided.</p>

<p>"A storm?" said the gentleman, "there is no danger
of that; see how bright the sun is shining!" and he
sent a smiling look towards the eyes of Mrs. Yonkers.</p>

<p>Her features brightened at the delicately-implied
compliment.</p>

<p>"I cannot help thinking," she said playfully, yet
with an almost imperceptible tremor in her voice,
"that the sun would shine brighter, but for the fear of
the coming eclipse."</p>

<p>"What is an eclipse but a shadow that passes
away?" said the visitor, with a second smile so admirably
forced that it dissipated, for the moment, the
vague suspicions that were flickering within the heart
of the young married woman.</p>

<p>But Dudley Mondel, for we may as well give the
gentleman a name, having made the effort which feeling
and policy dictated, immediately allowed his
countenance to relax into its old expression of serious
and sad meditativeness, whilst Columbia, who had
watched the exchange of looks, and listened to the
brief colloquy with acute attention, said in a tone of
sprightliness, "One would almost fancy that you were
talking parables, propounding enigmas, or trying to
be poetically sentimental. My dear mamma, I never
thought the weather so interesting a topic before."</p>

<p>"Who started it?" said Mrs. Yonkers, meeting Columbia's
sprightly manner with an equally excellent
assumption.</p>

<p>Mondel here made a desperate effort to start a new
subject of conversation, by alluding to a recently published
autobiography of an actress.</p>

<p>"It strikes me as the play of Hamlet, with the part
of Hamlet omitted," said Mrs. Yonkers "it lacks
reality; it is wanting in material facts."</p>

<p>"Are material facts the most real things in life?"
said Columbia, timidly.</p>

<p>"Not to those who live in dreams, my fairy-like
darling," replied Mrs. Yonkers, smiling, with a patronizing
air of superior experience; and then she
added, as if involuntarily, "but we soon discover how
little the most beautiful dreams can satisfy the heart,
how feeble are mere visions as food for the cravings
of the soul."</p>

<p>"I understand," said Columbia, shaking off her
timidity, and excited by the brilliancy of her own
fancy, "I understand that dear, distinct perceptions
are absolutely essential to the enjoyment of existence;
but it seems to me, that my delight in the perfume of
a flower is fully as interesting to record, as a naturalist's
description of its petals and outward characteristics."</p>

<p>"Always the same battle&mdash;the subjective <i>versus</i> the
objective&mdash;genius puzzling common-place," murmured
Mondel, inaudibly, as he stole a rapid glance at Columbia's
exquisite profile, pure and noble, as if cut by
the chisel of a god.</p>

<p>Dudley Mondel&mdash;we will leave the ladies to their
transcendental discussion, and devote ourselves to the
part of Hamlet for a few minutes&mdash;Dudley Mondel
found himself in a most peculiar position, A few
days before, he had been attracted to the house in
Fifth Avenue, by the beauty and accomplishments
of the fascinating Mrs. Yonkers. Pleased and flattered
by the lady's evident prepossession in his favor,
he had formed no plan, conceived no ulterior design.
All men, however philosophical they may be, are
pleased to become an object of interest to a lovely
woman. Nor could Mondel fail to admire the grace
and beauty of Mrs. Yonkers.</p>

<p>It was, however, with feelings of dismay and annoyance,
that he perceived, after a few interviews,
the extent of the feelings he had awakened. Profoundly
versed in all the mysteries of feminine nature,
he saw himself the object of a first deep, all-absorbing,
all-destroying passion, which he could not reciprocate,
and dared not slight; which he at the same
time feared and pitied, and which was suddenly
thrown as a bar athwart the path of a new vista of
happiness, unexpectedly opened before him.</p>

<p>In the centre of this vista stood Columbia.</p>

<p>On his first visit to Mrs. Yonkers, he recognized in
her step-daughter the very earth-born goddess which
his whole life had been spent in seeking. In the
very first flash of her eyes, he felt the soul of beauty
that sprung to meet his own, and already he was involved
in a sort of intrigue, from which it was impossible
to recede, without mortally wounding and
offending her, to whom he owed the introduction
to the suddenly discovered idol.</p>

<p>Love is a matter of organization. It is a simple
question of harmony between two instruments.
Hence, almost all real love is instantaneous as the explosion
which follows the application of a match to
gunpowder. We love a type which is, in reality, an
ideal reflex of our own souls. Every approximation
to that type affects us, as one harp is affected by the
vibrations of another. The more perfect the accord,
the louder and stronger the sympathetic vibration of
our nerves. Hence a more perfect image of the
ideal type will always destroy all feebler images;
hence inconstancy and all the sorrows of abandoned
love; hence the agonies of genius, in its deep longing
for sympathy, which it can only truly meet with
in genius itself; hence incomplete, shadowy, disappointed
loves&mdash;deep, dark, overwhelming sorrows;
hence the wild dreams of poetry,  the wild adventures
of poets, and their misapprehension by the ignorant
and the unscientific world!</p>

<p>Dudley Mondel was not what severe religionists
and vulgar disciplinarians would call a good man.
He was generous and brave, gentle and benevolent;
but his life had been passed in wild roving from land
to land on the one hand, from science to science, and
literature to literature on the other. He had criticised
all systems of morality to death. All religions and
systems had, in the crucible of his pitiless analysis,
melted away into forms of thought,&mdash;<i>ways of looking
at an idea</i>.  So that at last his own will had become his
sole law, and vice and virtue were nominal distinctions.
He was a popular writer, a poet, and a philosopher.
He had many admirers and some disciples.
He was a man famous in his way; and his vast reading
and varied knowledge filled his opponents, as well
as his friends, with amazement. But he was a man
as well as a student. He had seen and experienced
much.</p>

<p>He had known rapid reverses of fortune. He had
been a worker as well as an employer. If he had had
his follies and his mistresses, he had also written
books and engaged in many enterprises. Wherever
he was, he became more or less the centre point of
action&mdash;the motive and directing power. Men fancied
they drove him harnessed to the chariot of their
fortunes, whilst Mondel led them by the golden thread
of genius. No matter what he turned his attention to,
his severely logical mind at once grasped the fundamental
facts of the position.</p>

<p>Above all, he was ever true to himself. His soul
was ever kingly. His soul was his own, and his
body also. He was a free doer and thinker. Like
Talleyrand, he had no prejudices. Like Nelson, he
had no knowledge of fear. Like every true philosopher,
he had no master. He bent neither to men nor
to the opinions of men.</p>

<p>He could neither be bribed, intimidated nor humbugged.
His great vice, if vice it were, was pride.
But pride in the successful man is greatness;
pride is only condemned in those who fail. Tarquin
Superbus, would have been Tarquin the Superb, not
Tarquin the Proud, had he not been dethroned and
driven into exile.</p>

<p>Such was Mondel the man. We have yet to give
some idea of Mondel as a member of society.</p>

<p>In this respect, he was a struggling adventurer.
He had consumed his fortune and all he had since
acquired. In the golden phraseology of Wall street,
he was not worth a cent.</p>

<p>"There is plenty of gold scattered about,"
he would say in sportive mood; "when I want it, I will
take it. The world is my debtor and my banker.
One of these days, I will have a settlement, and, take
my funds into my own hands, for more profitable
investment."</p>

<p>If Mondel had any religion, it was the worship of
beauty. If he ever prayed, his prayers were the
words of love, entreating love. Beauty was, to his
intelligence, like music. Every face and form was a
new combination of harmony. Mondel had no conception
of life without woman's sympathy. But he
sought restlessly for the highest female perfection; in
his search, he had many adventures, and tried many
experiments. He had left more than one Ariadne
behind him to be consoled, let us hope, by some
nobler and more respectable god than Bacchus.</p>

<p>Finally, the mother of Mondel was an American senator's
daughter, and his father an English gentleman,
whilst his birth took place by a singular caprice
of destiny, in a packet-ship in the very centre of the
Atlantic ocean. The ship, moreover, was a French
ship, owned by a Dutchman. Thus, Mondel first
landed upon the soil of la belle France. He was
born a cosmopolite, without a country and without a
government, which latter fact accounts for his subsequent
contempt of all established political authorities,
great and small.</p>

<p>Having thus given the reader some vague idea of
the central character in the scene I am describing,
I shall resume the thread of active narrative without
further digression.</p>

<p>The desultory conversation, sustained for some time
with little interest to any of the three personages engaged
in it, was interrupted by the entrance of a servant,
who wished to speak with Mrs. Yonkers on some
household matter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yonkers rose to leave the room, but having
already reached the door, opened it, and taken one
step into the hall, she was impelled by that demon of
divination which jealousy lends to a woman who loves,
to turn suddenly back and unexpectedly re-enter the
apartment she was leaving. Her presentiment was
not without justification. The moment the door began
to close upon her form, a sudden change took
place in the expression of the faces of both Mondel
and Columbia. As if by an invincible attraction,
their heads turned upon their shoulders with the simultaneous
motion of two flowers affected by the same
gust of wind, or two wheels of a steam engine united
by the same band of gutta percha. Thus their eyes
were brought opposite to one another's, and each
drank in eagerly the longed-for rays, streaming as it
were from the very fountain-head of life, the man
absorbing deliciously the exhalation of innocent beauty,
spiritual purity and sweet intelligence of his lovely
companion, the girl drinking in with avidity
the torrent of thought, of intellect and noble manhood which
the gaze of Mondel poured in a flood of light upon
her now awakened being.</p>

<p>It was this meeting, or rather, if I may offend my
critics still further by my temerity, and say this rushing
together of the eyes of Mondel and Columbia,
which the sudden return of Mrs. Yonkers surprised,
without immediately disconcerting. Neither of the
eager gazers perceived it. They were both, for the
instant, carried away from all outward sensations by
the thrilling contemplation of that loveliness which
they found so marvellously realized in one another.
Mrs. Yonkers gazed, pale with anger.</p>

<p>Anger was her first sensation; the anguish was to
come afterwards.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mondel," said Columbia, and at the sound
of her own voice she blushed, and not till then; "Mr.
Mondel, have you ever seen a more charming woman
than my step-mother?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mondel, "never till I"&mdash;&mdash; At this
crisis, he suddenly became aware of the presence of
Mrs. Yonkers.</p>

<p>There she stood, pale and trembling, with a ghastly
invention of a smile flickering like a dead light upon
her lips.</p>

<p>But Mondel was a man who had seen too much of
life, to be taken unprepared whilst possibility of
escape yet remained to him.</p>

<p>"Never," he continued, without changing his
tone, "till I saw that lady who has just entered, and
who appears to me to surpass Mrs. Yonkers immeasurably
in every respect. Do you not think so?"</p>

<p>And both Mondel and Columbia laughed, and
their laugh sounded natural, for they were happy, and
could accomplish that, which to Mrs. Yonkers was
impossible. Hollow, indeed, was the laugh with
which she responded to the pleasantry, as she affected
to look for her handkerchief by the chair she had
occupied. She had only returned to pick up a piece
of laced French cambric, that was all!</p>

<p>But Mondel was not deceived by this shallow <i>ruse;</i>
and when he rose to take his leave, the look he
exchanged with Columbia was a revelation.  Henceforward,
he made up his mind that disguise  was
useless.</p>

<p>Oh, that look! that look! it burned into the very
heart of hearts of the young wife!</p>

<p>But she did not yet despair of victory over her
rival.</p>

<p id="c04">CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p>PEREGRINE COPE.</p>

</div>

<p>MONDEL had left the house of Mrs. Yonkers. It
was already dusk. He soon found himself in Broadway.
There is an invincible attraction about that
crowded thoroughfare. All the life of New York
seems to be concentrated in the perpetual flood of
humanity which, from early dawn till after midnight,
pours wave on wave along its rocky pavement.</p>

<p>Mondel was a man of the world in the true sense.
He shunned society, it is true, and yet he hated solitude.
It is a strange relief to a mind troubled by
gloomy reflections to be in the midst of a crowd of
animated figures. They distract without disturbing
the current of meditation. Mondel was an intense
observer of character. He was a skilful artist, and
an incomparable physiognomist. He read faces like
books. Every man he saw was to him more or less a
study, a problem, a subject of speculation. We have
already alluded to his passion for the criticism of
female beauty and expression.</p>

<p>This habit of observation was with him instinctive.
No matter how absorbed he might be in other
thoughts, it still went on in a parallel line of alternating
mental action.</p>

<p>However, he had progressed considerably down
Broadway; before any of the passing promenaders
had sufficiently arrested his attention to cause him to
give them anything more than a passing notice,
when suddenly three men of the most singular
aspect, and walking arm in arm, came suddenly
before him.</p>

<p>Other pedestrians on either side prevented him
from immediately passing the three strangers.</p>

<p>The most distinguished in appearance of the
three had the air of a sporting man, or a gambler
disguised as a clergyman, while his tall friend looked,
or tried to look, the extreme dandy and hotel-step
lounger. The third resembled a very sharp lawyer,
and wore a massive gold chain, which he played with
nervously, as if to assure himself that it still secured
the invisible measurer of time, which probably had
its abode in the breast-pocket of his waistcoat.</p>

<p>These well-dressed promenaders, whose hats
all three shone with an unearthly gloss, and whose clothes
fitted them, according as their figures were adaptable
to the inflexible mathematics of the ready-made system,
were, it must be admitted, no new characters to
the reader, but simply our worthy friends, the Professor,
Confidence Bob, and their acolyte, the Slinker,
of oyster-consuming memory.</p>

<p>The Professor alone might have passed for an
eccentric Southerner, a Tammany Hall politician, or a
foreign merchant. The Slinker might, unaccompanied,
have been mistaken for one of those contemptible
respectabilities so abundant in civilized
society. But Confidence Bob, with his air of reckless
impudence and outrageous assumption, at once threw
an air of burlesque extravagance over the "solemnly
constituted imposture" of the whole party.</p>

<p>"If those fellows," thought Mondel, as he quietly
moved out of the way, "are not three disreputable
rascals, may I never kiss a pretty woman again!"</p>

<p>"Ho!" cried a voice behind him. "Mondel, my
dear fellow, I am delighted to meet you. I am
as dull as the window of a newspaper office, or the
speech of one of Louis Napoleon's senators! I am
delighted to meet with a reasonable and talkable
being!"</p>

<p>"What, Cope? Peregrine Cope! Where do you
come from?"</p>

<p>"In a beehive, from Paris."</p>

<p>The speaker was a man of medium height, slender,
graceful figure, large bright eyes, careless, yet elegant
dress, and some seven and thirty years of age. In
turning to regard this new-comer, Mondel lost sight
of the three vagabonds, who, with a natural subterranean
instinct, descended ostentatiously into the
nearest drinking saloon.</p>

<p>"My dear Cope," said Mondel, taking his old
friend, for such he palpably was, by both hands, and
regarding him affectionately, "your arrival is most
apropos. I want some one to confide in, and, by a
curious chance, all my intimates are scattered abroad
over the earth. Bivar is gone to San Francisco,
Pinkney is editing a paper in Arkansaw, Rashmere
has eloped with Judge Spoker's wife, Madder is gone
to practice law in Oregon, and Pearlin is gone to the
devil&mdash;at any rate, nobody knows what has become
of him&mdash;so that some think he has retired to a remote
part of Long Island, to take lessons in singing from
a young lady, who is missing from Flicflac's theatre.
For my part, I suspect he has committed suicide, out
of disgust for his own mediocrity."</p>

<p>"Very likely," said Peregrine Cope. "If he has,
the trait is a creditable one in his character; but
where can we sit down quietly, and talk at our ease?
That last rowdy, who ran against me, nearly dislocated
my shoulder. Broadway is not broad enough
for dialogue. Where can we rest ourselves?"</p>

<p>"Let us go down into the Waverly saloon, and
take some supper. It is as quiet and well-conducted
a place as any in the city. Besides, the landlord imports
his own cigars direct from Havana."</p>

<p>"The Waverly!" said Cope&mdash;"with all my heart.
The name has a romantic sound, which I like. By
the way; why do not <i>you</i> turn great unknown, and
astonish the world by a new and successful mystification?"</p>

<p>"Because, in the first place, the world would not
be mystified, and we live in an age of newspapers.
Secondly, because the anonymous system is a damnable
swindle, expressly invented to cheat authors out
of their reputations. Why, my dear Cope, <i>I</i> published
more than a dozen anonymous volumes before I was
five and twenty years of age, and before anybody
ever heard of me."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?"</p>

<p>"Yes! not only possible, but true. But to revert
to your proposition as to writing novels, I do not
believe in novel-writing any more."</p>

<p>"Not believe in novel-writing?"</p>

<p>"No, I think the form is exhausted. I think that
Scott, Bulwer, Dickens, Thackeray, &amp; Co., have used
it up. Novels are no longer novel. The same scenes
and situations, as dramatists say, reappear over and
over again, till one is sick of them. What Bulwer
gave us hot with sauce, Thackeray gives us cold with
pickles, and both are behind the age, old fogies with
no spirit of prophecy in them. I should like to do
something better for English literature than tread in
the footsteps of <i>such</i> masters."</p>

<p>"But if you abolish the novel, what sort of light
reading can you invent to replace it? Essays soon
grow tiresome. Dramas are imperfect without the
accessories of the stage; and what decent author can
endure the vulgarity and impertinence of managers?
Poetry is a bore to nine readers out of ten."</p>

<p>"Ninety-nine out of a hundred," said Mondel
laughing, "do not spare my feelings. It is not
my fault, but my misfortune, that I am a bit of a poet."</p>

<p>"But what do you propose as a substitute for the
worn-out novel?"</p>

<p>"<i>Memoirs</i>&mdash;not merely of celebrities, but of Jack,
Tom and Harry. <i>Tales</i>, compact and artistic, carrying
out an idea like a poem, short and good, not
lengthy and windy like six romances out of seven,
even of the better class. <i>Historical studies</i>, <i>Philosophical
treatises</i>, made amusing, witty and intelligible,
instead of dull, ponderous and obscure.  <i>Travels</i> full
of accurate observation, not of stupid national prejudice.
In a word, ideas and facts, instead of stereotyped
scenes and phrases everlastingly repeated.
For the rest, there is a new school of poetry to be
established. We want poets who will take the trouble,
like musicians or artists, to learn the rudiments
of their art, before astonishing the world with such
crude monstrosities, as "Life-dramas," and all that
sort of feeble trash, the varied flummery of egotism,
inexperience and affectation. In a word, we want
artists, not <i>dilettanti!</i>"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" said Cope, "you are severe on the
Smiths and the Joneses, Mondel, and I am with you.
If the authors of that line of book, Festus, Balder, &amp;c.
had the real poetical stuff in them, they would go out
into the world and <i>do</i> something more than merely
howl lamentations and egotism in blank verse. But
why does not a great poet arise here in America?"</p>

<p>"Because, if he were to appear, he would <i>starve</i>;"
said Mondel drily. "The hour for American genius
to raise the standard of a national literature is at hand,
but not yet arrived. We are still inundated with
trashy reprints and trashier imitations. We are still
plagued with that ridiculous invention of the old
world, <i>magazines</i>&mdash; the curse of talent, and the hotbed
of amateur scribblomania, which it so absurdly
encourages."</p>

<p>"Bravo," said Cope, "I always despised a magazine!
How absurd to collect a bundle of trash, with
one good article, perhaps, to flavor it, to palm off
quantity for quality, and, as in certain infamous
cases, to conceal the names of the authors in order to
prevent them from deriving independent reputation
from their contributions. But do not let us discuss
such meanness, or the rascals who live by it. I have
other matters to talk to you about."</p>

<p>By this time, the two friends were snugly ensconced
in a box; supper ordered, and the blind drawn down.
As the gas blazed up into full flame, Peregrine Cope
observed the face of Mondel was pale and weary, as
with many days of care and sadness.</p>

<div class="center">

<p id="c05">CHAPTER V.</p>

<p>FITZGAMMON O'BOUNCER.</p>

</div>

<p>"I DO not wish to sentimentalize," said Mondel,
thoughtfully, to his friend, as soon as they had discussed
the&mdash;in New York&mdash;inevitable oysters, and
opened a second bottle of champagne. "I do not
wish to sentimentalize, but it seems to me, judging
from all I hear and read, that a deep-seated and
gloomy discontent pervades the minds of most
persons of culture in the present age. In America this
feeling is as rife as in Europe. There is no affectation
about it. Every day I hear men&mdash;aye, and
women&mdash;even fair and lovely girls, express an indifference
to life, a disgust for the world, a vague, objectless
dissatisfaction that is utterly depressing and
discouraging."</p>

<p>"You associate, probably," said Cope, "with the
literary class more than any other, and since the
calamities of authors are proverbial and universal,
as we ourselves know from dire experience in many
cities, it is no wonder that they utter cries of pain,
and even groans of despair in their sufferings. Authors
love pleasure,&mdash;they are poor. Superior in
education and refinement to all other classes, they
are proud and in debt. The popular taste is in its
infancy, and naturally is captivated by books written
most down to the level of the vulgar apprehension.
Hence the success of female writers, and commonplace
trivialities. The poet and the student is perhaps
out of his element amongst us."</p>

<p>"Not so!" said Mondel, brightening up and speaking
with decided animation. "You, Cope, are a New
England Yankee, and, with all your travelled lore, can
scarcely see things <i>here</i> with the clearness of view
given to me, a cosmopolite and a stranger. I have
neither patriotism nor prejudices. I see that in England
literature has exhausted itself. It is only here
in America that new circumstances and a new life
can bring forth a new poet. For my part I have
long abandoned the idea of playing the part of a
mere literary man. If I can originate a thought, I
care little for the mode of its realization. At this
moment I am ruined&mdash;as usual&mdash;to all appearances."</p>

<p>"You are not prospering then in a pecuniary line?"
said Cope.</p>

<p>"Not in the slightest degree," replied Mondel,
coolly.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"What do you live on?"</p>

<p>"Credit."</p>

<p>"What are your prospects?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"Not know!" said Cope, astounded at the unparalleled
recklessness of this accomplished desperado.</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Mondel; "how should I?
There is no sail in sight; but I have not cruised
for ten long years on the ocean of adventure without
learning that prizes turn up when we least expect
them."</p>

<p>"Ah, Mondel! how are you?" said a sonorous
voice. "I have some good news for you. I saw
Flicflac to-day. He is delighted with your comedy.
It is to be put in rehearsal at once."</p>

<p>"Thank you for your good news! Pray, sit down&mdash;Mr.
Peregrine Cope&mdash;Mr. Fitzgammon O'Bouncer.
You, hear," said Mondel to Cope. "God takes care
of the sparrows. The man who sows rarely fails to
reap, at some period or other. It is two months
since I sent in that comedy&mdash;I had almost forgotten it.
How have you been getting on lately, O'Bouncer?"</p>

<p>"Splendidly!" said O'Bouncer, who had not paid
his board for three months, and had borrowed of
every one he knew, till the list was utterly exhausted,
"Splendidly! the&mdash;&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash;and the&mdash;&mdash;(mentioning
the three principal daily papers) are constantly
dunning me to write leaders for them.
H&mdash;&mdash;r, P&mdash;&mdash;m, and G&mdash;&mdash;m's Magazines have
offered to accept and pay in advance for anything I
write. Flicflac has taken my farce and the melodrama;
and I am now on a tragedy, for which
For&mdash;&mdash;st is to give a thousand dollars cash, as soon
as it is finished."</p>

<p>"Is any of it written yet?" said Cope, who, from
a long experience of Mondel, detected in his immovable
gravity the spirit of irony, which in this strange
man took so many varied forms of expression.</p>

<p>"Not exactly&mdash;<i>written</i>," said O'Bouncer, slightly
disconcerted&mdash;even brazen statues are occasionally
shaken on their pedestals&mdash;"but I have the plot
drawn up. It is first rate."</p>

<p>"Pray, let us hear it," said Mondel, with an
imperceptible side glance at Cope.</p>

<p>"Nothing could delight me more," said Peregrine,
with polite interest.</p>

<p>"Of course it must be in profound confidence,"
said O'Bouncer.</p>

<p>"Of course," assured his companions.</p>

<p>"I wonder who is in the next box but me?" said
the author of the unwritten tragedy, suspiciously;
and, hearing some noise, which struck him as peculiar,
Mr. Fitzgammon O'Bouncer, who was of an
active muscularity, suddenly sprang upon the seat,
and looked over the partition. Strange to say, he
found himself face to face with another gentleman,
who also was looking over the partition on the other
side of the empty box!</p>

<p>With my usual abhorrence of mystery, I beg at
once to admit that this curious personage was no
other than our already familiar acquaintance, Confidence
Bob, who had taken up that position, in order
to overhear more conveniently the conversation of
the literary party. Whatever might have been
Bob's motive for this espionage, he was not disposed
to allow himself to be detected. Therefore, in his
coolest and blandest manner he said, before O'Bouncer,
whose eyes flashed fire, could utter a word:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir. Did you hear a hat drop? Mine
has just fallen into this box."</p>

<p>"No sir," said O'Bouncer, sharply, redescending
to his seat. "Some snob who has dropped his hat,"
he explained to Mondel and Cope.
"By Jove! I thought it might be one of those confounded oyster-critics.
Yes, bring me a glass of punch, waitarrh!"</p>

<p>Mr. Fitzgammon O'Bouncer always spoke to
waiters with a lofty and dignified severity. Mr. F.
O'Bouncer was intensely aristocratic in his feelings.
Like all Irishmen, he came of a great but impoverished
family, was heir to an estate of unascertained
rental, was a lineal descendant of the ancient
Irish kings, and would rather have been damned eternally
than admitted that he had had a drop of plebeian blood
in his veins, since Adam, or Lord Monboddo's monkeys,
whichever legend may be preferred.</p>

<p>"He was a penny-a-liner in Dublin, sir, Jim
Bounce, a well-known character," said Bubbleton,
the manager, one day, with a grin of galvanic humor.
Ye gods! how O'Bouncer, whose maternal ancestors,
for untold ages, were Fitzgammons and princes&mdash;how
he would have shuddered at this awful saga or legend,
invented by Bubbleton, in his ferocious scorn of an
offending critic!</p>

<p>But do not let the reader run away with any such
idea. Fitzgammon O'Bouncer was no doubt a gentleman,
according to his own and the social meaning
of the phrase. He was well educated, had edited,
even to the death, a magazine in London, wrote in
every style but his own (not having any in particular),
and was what, even in the best European
society, would be considered an accomplished man.
His verses were very sweet, if not very strong&mdash;like
French tea. His lively writings were pleasant, if
hastily written, and, therefore, diluted&mdash;good negus,
if not rare wine. His farce was not damned, if not
actually successful. When he wrote, his mind
seemed to take its tone from the last book he had
read, or the last person he had talked to. Without
intending it, he was a wonderful imitator&mdash;certainly
never a servile plagiarist. In short, he was a man
of universal talent and adaptive genius; a brilliant
versatility, precociously perfect, in his way, for he
was scarcely six and twenty years of age.</p>

<p>In appearance he was handsome, had a fine brow,
and a decided nose, which Napoleon would have
appreciated. He was carefully dressed, and had
palpably trimmed his moustaches and whiskers with
laborious exactness. In profile, his head was remarkable
for the exaggeration of the organs of self-esteem
and love of approval, which, with the flatness of his
veneration, gave his cranium a strange angularity.
His figure was somewhat tall, and his frame powerful,
active, and symmetrical. His complexion was
florid, his hair dark, his eyes blue, and of a
peculiar softness, though by no means conveying the idea of
a peculiar gentle nature. On the contrary, his general
expression was that of a man whose duty to himself
would be performed at all hazards, whatever
became of the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Morally, he was good-natured and impulsive, yet
politic and selfish. He was extravagant and brave&mdash;spurred
on by vanity, he could be generous and
heroic. The great vice of his character was his inordinate
self esteem, which had taken the diseased
form of ambition for superior social position. Even
as it was, the young Irish adventurer fondly affected
the airs of a scion of nobility&mdash;an exiled prince&mdash;I
know not what <i>r&ocirc;le de fantasie</i>, to the great amusement
of his friends. He was not content that those
to whom fortune had given inferior education, and
antecedents to himself, should practically stand before
him in the social scale; he also wished them to feel,
and in a manner indirectly acknowledge, this intangible
advantage which he believed in as a divine
right, and yet half doubted himself, because he felt
that it was not admitted by others.</p>

<p>Mondel, born himself of a distinguished and historical
family, strove to reason O'Bouncer out of this
weakness, and to persuade him into a philosophical
republicanism, which, whilst admitting distinctions of
individuals and even of classes, repudiates the insolence
of <i>caste</i> as a delusion and a dream in a free
country. But every man is mad on some topic, and
aristocratic pretension was O'Bouncer's, as perhaps
intellectual domination was his more experienced
friend's monomania. Fitzgammon was ever taken in
by the absurd tinsel of New York fashionable society,
that ridiculous agglomeration of vulgarity, ignorance,
vanity and imitation, in which the London and Paris
<i>bourgeoisie</i> is caricatured, just as the London and
Parisian <i>bourgeois</i> caricature the people of the Quarter
St. Germain and St. James, themselves a caricature
of defunct aristocratic society which can never
again be reproduced upon this earth. For the sake of
the <i>people</i>, the future, and human dignity and intelligence,
I rejoice that it is so.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p id="c06">CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p>THE PLOT.</p>

</div>

<p>"WELL" said Mondel, "to return to your tragedy."</p>

<p>"Yes, to return to the tragedy," said Cope.</p>

<p>O'Bouncer stroked his moustache, which being of
a perfectly natural brown, he dyed assiduously of a
deep purple black, and tossing his head back like a
spirited young horse, with an air of semi-disdainful
self-complacency thus commenced his description:</p>

<p>"In the first place I flatter myself that the idea of
the piece is entirely original. There are two rivals in
love with the same girl."</p>

<p>"Rivals usually are," observed Cope, parenthetically.
Cope was a precisionist, and the last man in
the world to make allowances for the fatal facility of
Hibernian narrative. When Cope wrote, every word
had its place like a piece on a chess-board. Even
euphony would not excuse a superfluous adjective in
his eyes. Like Mondel, he considered writing an art
and talking a science. As for O'Bouncer, he trusted
to habit and the inspiration of the moment, both in
conversation and in writing. He had the cunning of
the man of the world, but little of the soul of the artist
in his nature. Indeed art was the one thing which
he never could comprehend. A professional critic, he
wrote brilliantly but falsely. His imagination dominated
his judgment, and worst crime of all, he was
superficial&mdash;worse yet, <i>consciously</i> superficial. That
is, he knew and disguised his ignorance of a given
topic with consummate dexterity. This his widely
spread information enabled him to do with great tact
and success. Perhaps few writers for the press possessed
the facility and the power of this accomplished
personage. Perhaps to say that in his way he was a
man of genius would scarcely be an exaggeration.</p>

<p>"The elder rival," continued O'Bouncer, "the villain
of the piece, a man of no family&mdash;stay, no&mdash;a
cousin of the young lady, who is a countess in her
own sight, tells the other rival, the young Duke of
Whats-its-name, that she&mdash;the countess&mdash;<i>has a cork
leg</i>! and deplores her sensitiveness on the subject.
Of course it is impossible for the young rival to find
out with certainty whether this is the fact or not, and
he is haunted by the most harrowing uncertainty."</p>

<p>"Why does he not ask the family physician?" said
Cope.</p>

<p>"Or give her an opiate and find out whilst she is
asleep?" said Mondel.

<p>"Or bribe the lady's maid?"</p>

<p>"Or peep through her keyhole, whilst she is
undressing?"</p>

<p>"Or pretend to stumble on approaching her; or
make a declaration on his knees, and clasp hers in his
frantic passion?"</p>

<p>"Or openly tell the story as an example of the
calumnies afloat, and study her expression?"</p>

<p>"Because," said O'Bouncer, "none of those actions
would suit my plot. In the end, he sets the house on
fire at night, and saves the young countess himself
in her night dress, when, of course, he has an ample
opportunity of resolving all his doubts. Meanwhile,
you see, the other rival has poisoned his wife, who
suddenly turned up, and"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>At this moment, a stranger, who had entered the
saloon, suddenly descried Mondel; and, turning away
from the bar, directed his step towards the box, of
which the blind had been left unlowered by the last
waiter.</p>

<p>The new comer was a pale, thin man, slightly
above the ordinary height, erect in form, stern in
mien, and of commanding aspect. Beneath his dark,
massive brows, flashed eyes cold, scintillating, and
penetrating, as those of an osprey. He stretched out
his hand to Mondel, who took it coldly, and smiled
with that faint, sad smile, which had yielded to a
more genuine expression of merriment during the
commencement of O'Bouncer's recital.</p>

<p>"What, Mr. Cope, too?" said the stranger; "I am
decidedly in the way of meeting old friends. When
did you return from Paris? I thought you were to be
secretary of legation?"</p>

<p>"Indeed?" said Cope, who at first looked coldly
on the stranger; "I assure you I never expected
anything of the kind."</p>

<p>"Well, I know it was talked of, at Washington,"
said the stranger, with the gravity of a diplomatist of
fifty, though he himself could scarcely have reached
his thirtieth year.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mr. Berkeley," said Mondel, "and let
me make you acquainted with Mr. O'Bouncer.
Mr. Fitzgammon O'Bouncer&mdash;Mr. Berkeley. Mr.
O'Bouncer's writing must be known to you, if you
ever read the magazines or reviews."</p>

<p>"Both the name and writings of Mr. Fitzgammon
O'Bouncer are perfectly familiar to me," said he
whom Mondel had introduced by the name of Berkeley,
with consummate gravity.</p>

<p>"A very gentlemanly man," thought O'Bouncer
to himself; "decidedly a <i>distingu&eacute;</i> air&mdash;quite aristocratic,
in fact;" and the young Milesian was perfectly
captivated by the stranger, to whom his writings
and name were so perfectly familiar.</p>

<p>"A coxcomb and a scribbler," was the saturnine
reflection of the self-possessed diplomatist. "I wonder
what the devil he writes; occasional poems and
sketches for magazines, I suppose; in love with himself
and every pretty woman he meets; fond of dress,
but can't do it&mdash;ties his cravat like a mathematical
figure&mdash;got quizzed to death in Europe amongst the
fast sets&mdash;wants money, ditto <i>savoir faire</i>&mdash;not
worth <i>my</i> while to know&mdash;no use&mdash;perhaps an encumbrance.
Besides, he looks inquisitive, with
those soft, selfish, watchful eyes of his!"</p>

<p>Like an electric flash these thoughts passed through
Berkeley's cold and analytic mind.</p>

<p>"Suppose we adjourn to my rooms, where we can
smoke our cigars more at ease," said Mondel, preparing
to rise.</p>

<p>"And Mrs. Mondel?" said Berkeley.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mondel! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not curious, if you have poisoned your
wife, or given her the sack, like the Turks. It is no
affair of mine. Excuse my indiscretion."</p>

<p>"My wife?&mdash;my <i>wife?</i>?" said Mondel, somewhat
coldly; "really I do not understand."</p>

<p>"No? Why, did you not introduce me to her at
Niagara Falls, last year? I really must apologize for
the mistake, if it be one."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>that</i> girl!" said Mondel, laughing. "I
had quite forgotten. <i>She</i> is married to a man at
St. Louis I had a letter from her the other day."</p>

<p>"What was she?" said O'Bouncer, who was not to
be beaten even by a born Yankee in desire for information
on all topics.</p>

<p>"An experiment," replied Mondel, gloomily, "and,
as usual, a failure."</p>

<p>"Woman is a mistake altogether," said Cope.
"She is a fascinating humbug."</p>

<p>Cope did not, at that moment, happen to be in love.</p>

<p>"I wonder if there will be any sexes in the next
world?" said Mondel.</p>

<p>"I hope so," sighed Cope, piously, thus giving the
lie to his affected misogyny.</p>

<p>"The next world!" said Berkeley. "I thought
you did not believe in anything, Mondel."</p>

<p>"Nor do I&mdash;perhaps, however, that is next door to
believing in everything."</p>

<p>And the supposed skeptic rose, and, followed by
the rest of the party, approached the bar of the saloon,
for the purpose of settling the score.</p>

<p>As they crossed the room, Berkeley said, carelessly,
to Mondel, "You know Mrs. Yonkers?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a charming woman," replied Mondel, carelessly.
"Do you know her?"</p>

<p>"Intimately," said Berkeley, and his voice trembled
slightly.</p>

<p>Mondel looked his collocutor full in the face, and
said, with affected enthusiasm, "She is very beautiful!"</p>

<p>"<i>Very!</i>" replied Berkeley, and his fierce, quick
glance betrayed to Mondel a jealous and implacable
rival. Immediately, the idea of making this accident
a bridge of safety for his own new-born passion
crossed the mind of the acute reader of souls.</p>

<p>"What do you think of Columbia Yonkers?" said
Mondel, with difficulty commanding his own voice
and features.</p>

<p>"A very pretty girl&mdash;charming!" said Berkeley
indifferently.</p>

<p>"He loves Amelia; praised be the unknown gods!"
reflected Mondel.</p>

<p>Poor H. B. Yonkers! thou respectable man of large
property, for how very little didst thou enter into
the calculation of this penniless adventurer!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the three vagabonds had also emerged
from their box, and advanced towards the bar.</p>

<p>"Bob!" said the Slinker, tugging at his tall friend's
coat-tails, "Bob, there he is!"</p>

<p>"Where?&mdash;who?"</p>

<p>"There!&mdash;<i>he</i>&mdash;the Alterer."</p>

<p>And the two vagabonds at the same instant, fixed their
eyes upon Berkeley, who cast towards them a
furtive glance of disdain and menace.</p>

<p>At the same time, O'Bouncer took the opportunity
of surveying the mysterious three with an air of contemptuous
curiosity, so little disguised, that Confidence Bob,
who recognized the editor (whom he had
seen before), though the editor did not in the least
remember Bob, Confidence Bob, we repeat, being
full of brandy and cigars, and at least two-thirds
drunk, thus rudely abandoned all conventional
restraint, and, if I may use the expression, let loose
the dogs of war by the following explosion of indignation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What the blazes are you staring at, with your
damnation moustache, you precious shadow of a
tailor, you infernal Paddy you?"</p>

<p>The row which followed the utterance of this
remarkable speech, shall be described Homerically in
a chapter devoted to the subject.</p>

<p>If it were not for love-making and fighting,
life would be a very dull affair, and novels about speculations
in cotton and Nicaragua stock would hardly be
considered works of an interesting or exciting character.
Therefore, most respectable reader, pray excuse
my veracious description of this most disreputable
shindy.</p>

<p id="c07">CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p>THE ROW.</p>

</div>

<p>THE O'Bouncer&mdash;that excited magnifico, whom the
stern fiat of destiny and relentless duns had driven to
these Western shores&mdash;the O'Bouncer, that loftily
descended young Celtic prince, maternally proceeding
from the illustrious and world-renowned house of
Fitzgammon, that brilliant author of a possibly forthcoming
tragedy, remained what the French called
<i>atterr&eacute;</i>, earth-glued&mdash;amazed, stunned at the audacity
of Bob&mdash;Bob of confidential devices!</p>

<p>Possibly, the O'Bouncer's first idea was, like
Vathek, the Caliph of Bagdad, to destroy his enemy
by one terrible look. That failing, it occurred to the
rage-electrified Fitzgammon to take out a revolver
which he carried in his pocket, and at once dismiss
the wretch who had insulted the majesty of his royal
blood to infernal Tartarus and the shadowy shores
of Acheron. Prudence, however, and a dim vision
of trial by jury, and other consequences dreadful to
dwell upon, restrained this reckless impulse. Lastly,
O'Bouncer resolved to rush immediately on the profane
outrager of his <i>grandezza</i>, and give him the
soundest thrashing possible within the briefest possible
period of time.</p>

<p>"I may get a black eye, or a swelled lip," thought
the conventional O'Bouncer; "but that must be
chanced, even if I do not see Miss Candlesoap for a
fortnight. It is an awful sacrifice. However, here
goes! At the worst, I have the revolver."</p>

<p>Miss Candlesoap, be it parenthetically remarked,
was an heiress of the Fifth Avenue hierarchy; and
an object of the O'Bouncer's wild young heart's
devotion. Not that the great Fitzgammon was guilty
of falling in love, in the extravagant sense of the
word. He was too sensible for that, and worshipped
the pure unity or abstract number one far too intensely.
But Miss Candlesoap was pretty, and with
her quarter of a million dollars Fitzgammon would,
in his own eyes, and in those of the world, be, at
length, somebody. And to become somebody was
the grand aim of O'Bouncer's most transcendant
ambition.</p>

<p>It may be here darkly hinted, that old Candlesoap
laid the modest foundations of his fortune in a corner
grocery, by a judicious scorn of weights and measures,
and a dexterity in adulterating liquors rarely
surpassed. But that was long ago, and the Candlesoaps
were now merchant princes, and grandees in
the world of the Snookses and the Joneses, those
Jupiters and Apollos of the New York fashionable
Olympus. O'Bouncer himself assured Mondel (pitiless
and unimpressionable skeptic!) that the Candlesoaps
were of noble origin in the old country, and
quite equal to the Percys and Howards in their way;
though, indeed, O'Bouncer might have well dispensed
with nobility in a wife, seeing that he had so
large an amount of that intangible transatlantic commodity
enshrined in his own person. But it is an old
proverb, which says of some people&mdash;"the more they
have, the more they want." Some men are intellectual
gluttons; though the memoirs of such gluttons
are rarely as candid as that amusing autobiography
published a couple of years ago, in a review, by one
of O'Bouncer's most distinguished compatriots.</p>

<p>Confidence Bob, now the Robert Mombcross, Esq.,
of social life, whose personal courage, like that of the
average run of rogues, was of a very flickering brightness,
mistook O'Bouncer's moral hesitation, very
naturally, for a symptom of physical timidity; and,
puffing his cigar very coolly in the face of the fiery
editor, already seemed to consider, in whist-player's
phrase, the odd trick as his own.</p>

<p>He was destined to be cruelly undeceived. Thus
perchance might an inexperienced hound have approached
a couchant panther, or a foolish heron in
the early days of ornithology have flaunted to his face
a fierce gerfalcon, resting from his sunward flight.</p>

<p>O'Bouncer's eyes flashed a bluish flame. Quick
as light he struck the long vagabond one terrible blow
between the eyes, which sent the Confidence man reeling
dizzily against the nearest pillar.</p>

<p>"Stand up, Bob, and walk into him, you fool!"
roared the excited Professor, whose unworthy pupil in
the art of self-defence that personage had been.</p>

<p>But O'Bouncer did not care a chip for the noble art
of self-defence. His blood was up. Black eyes and
the loss of Miss Candlesoap excepted, he was afraid
of nothing very particularly. O'Bouncer might be a
coxcomb, he certainly was not a coward.</p>

<p>"Bravo! well done!" cried Mondel, as at the second
round Mr. Robert Mombcross measured his six
feet upon the floor.</p>

<p>"Come, none of <i>your</i> nonsense!" grunted the Professor,
squaring up to Dudley, and bent upon retrieving
the honor of his party.</p>

<p>"My good man," said Mondel, in that deep tone
of confident menace, which to the vulgar is a mystery,
"take care&mdash;I warn you you will hurt yourself"</p>

<p>"You are armed, I suppose?" retorted the ruffian,
scornfully, and he drew a formidable bowie knife.</p>

<p>"Stand back, idiot!" shouted a voice of thunder,
and the Alterer sprang forwards to throw himself
between his familiar and Mondel, who had coolly
stepped one step backwards, and drawn an exquisitely
small double-barrelled pistol, suspended, like a watch,
by a fine steel chain from his neck. At the same
moment Peregrine Cope, who had smoked calmly
during the whole scene, seeing the bowie-knife drawn,
and seized with apprehension for his friend's safety,
sprang forwards, and, regardless of his personal danger,
laid the huge athlete prostrate with one crashing blow
of a large cut glass decanter, caught up, in the excitement
of the moment, as a weapon. Simultaneously
with this unexpected movement of Cope, was heard
the sharp report of Mondel's pistol, and as if by an
electric shock of sympathy, every one in the saloon
was suddenly calmed and awe-stricken. Confidence
Bob, O'Bouncer, Cope, Berkeley, Mondel, and the
landlord of the saloon (who was kicking the Slinker
from behind his bar, where that humble practitioner
in human spoliation had taken refuge on all fours like
a rat), all crowded round the wounded champion,
who, like the villains in the old romances, had fallen
without a groan, and lay perfectly still and bleeding
upon the floor.</p>

<p>"You have shot him," said O'Bouncer.</p>

<p>"I fear you have killed him!" said Berkeley; anxiously.</p>

<p>Mondel said nothing. He knelt down and sought
hastily for traces of his bullet; in so doing he accidentally
drew a large silver watch from the Professor's
waistcoat pocket, when, O marvellous fortune! a deep
indent in the very centre of its thick tarnished case,
and a corroborative mark on the exterior of his waistcoat
demonstrated that it was to the bottle, and not
to the bullet, that the pugilist was indebted for his
possible quietus. Accordingly Mondel proceeded to
examine the wound inflicted by the decanter of
Cope. It was a deep ugly gash, from which the
blood flowed freely.</p>

<p>"I fear the skull is fractured," said Mondel.</p>

<p>"I did it to save your life," said Cope.</p>

<p>That Cope <i>had</i> saved the life of Mondel was scarcely
doubtful, for, as the bullet had failed to take effect,
another instant would probably have seen the knife
of the pugilist buried in the body of his antagonist.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear friend, you did wisely," said
Mondel; "still I should be sorry that the man should
die in consequence of a mere drunken brawl."</p>

<p>"Where does he live?&mdash;who is he?" said O'Bouncer,
looking round for the companions of the wounded
vagabond.</p>

<p>But they were no longer present. At a wave of
the <i>Alterer's</i> hand they had quietly absconded. The
superior demon had judged it best to get rid of his
imps, for fear they should, by some unforeseen inadvertency,
compromise their master and his character.</p>

<p>During the whole scene, Berkeley had been filled
with the utmost dread of exposure. His arrival at
the saloon had been purely accidental. Nothing
could have annoyed him more than an encounter
with his agents in so public a place. What to do
with the Professor perplexed him. The man was
wounded, might have a fever, become delirious, talk
at random; yet to take him home to his, Berkeley's,
house, was a perilous proceeding, and might lead to the
detection of his own malpractices, or at least throw
suspicion on his character. The Alterer did not dare
run any risks, nevertheless he had almost resolved to
extend the hospitality of his roof to his unfortunate
minister, when to his horror and alarm Mondel said,
abruptly: "I have my reasons for wishing this affair
to be hushed up quietly. It is now late. Every
moment strangers may enter. I have resolved to
take this man home with me, and have him attended
to. Cope, will you get a carriage while I bind up his
head? On our way we will call for Doctor Vortex."</p>

<p>Thus the pugilistic Professor, housebreaker and
robber, became the guest of Mondel, whilst the
Alterer, after promising to call and inquire about the
sick man next day, walked homewards in a state of
doubt, suspicion, and vexation, which so absorbed his
mind that he did not even observe that the illustrious
Fitzgammon O'Bouncer was walking by his side, and
fighting the battle with Confidence Bob over again,
after the custom of most heroes, ancient and modern.</p>

<p>"Come and see me," said the Irishman, frankly, as
they parted.</p>

<p>"I'll see you d&mdash;&mdash;d first!" thought the Alterer,
who had other business on hand than to make new
acquaintances amongst fast young men of letters.
However, he bowed with exquisite politeness, and
replied cordially:</p>

<p>"Nothing will give me greater pleasure, Mr.
O'Bouncer. Good night, sir; I hope your repose will
not be disturbed by the nervous excitement you have
undergone."</p>

<p>And so they parted at the corner of &mdash;th street.</p>

<p>"Devilish gentlemanly fellow, Berkeley," mused
O'Bouncer, "good name&mdash;no doubt a person of
respectable descent. At any rate I hope his father
was not a shop-keeper. It is a horrid thing to know
a man whose father was a shop-keeper. One is apt to
wound his feelings in talking. Who is Cope, I wonder?
Not an old Knickerbocker, evidently, or his
name would be Goosefelt, or Vanderscrewler, or some
such name. He has not the <i>air noble</i>.  None of these
Yankees have. He is too lively to be dignified, and
makes himself quite at home with you at starting.
Mondel seems to know him very well. I wonder
where they met? I wonder if Berkeley or Cope are
rich? I wish, by the way, Mondel had shot that fellow;
a trial for murder would have been so exciting.
I don't <i>quite</i> like Mondel. Sometimes I fancy he
does not believe in my pedigree. I suspect his own
is rather mystified, or he would not be so damnably
fond of democracy. Besides, he has no respect for
Irishmen; and the way he laughs at our runaway
patients is disgusting, though for that matter they are
a cursed set of blockheads and bores!"</p>

<p>Poor O'Bouncer! he secretly despised his country.
He was an Anglicised Celt. To call him Englishman,
was the surest way to flatter him. He lacked the
patriotic monomania which often supplies the place
of so many other advantages. He was an Irishman
because he could not help it. How gladly would he
have forgotten it, could the world have forgotten it
also. But the O'Bouncer name was legion in the
land. There was no evading the destinies; so
O'Bouncer contented himself with cutting his own
compatriots. To do him justice, O'Bouncer was too
much of a man to be an Irishman in America, or
mingle in the petty intrigues of American-Irish
politics. Strong was his hope, that the grand Candlesoap
alliance would finally settle the difficulty.</p>

<p>"At any rate," thought O'Bouncer, "I can take
the girl to Europe, and spend her money in Paris;
and a fellow with tin is sure to get into society somehow!"</p>

<p>O'Bouncer was a refined sensualist, and could
imagine no better life than the luxurious corruption
of European aristocracy. To share that life,
was his ambition, his hope, his dream.</p>

<p>It was really a great pity that he was not a man of
large fortune, and Viscount Fitzgammon. He would
have enjoyed a title and a fortune so intensely. But,
the Parc&aelig; were inexorable.</p>

<p id="c08">CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p>A CURIOUS GIRL.</p>

</div>

<p>COLUMBIA YONKERS was one of those rare women,
who, when they meet with men of a certain class,
become truly wonderful and witch-like in their attributes.</p>

<p>TAUSSENEL in his Passional Zoology (an admirable
work which Dr. Edgeworth Lazarus has admirably
translated) describes the "blonde woman" as "the
most precious gift of heaven, a charming creation
with which the Supreme Ordainer of things has gifted
the pale countries of the North, to compensate them
for the absence of the sun."</p>

<p>In truth, to those who understand her, the fair beauty,
in her full development, is a most admirable and
soul-dazzling creature. From her we derive our only
idea of angels, goddesses, elemental nymphs, and all
beautiful spirits superior to man. Poetry and Art
prove it. The Terrestrial Venus is a brunette, the
Celestial is a blonde. Dark beauty gives security to
the affections, fair loveliness enchantment to the
imagination. The one may afford us real satisfaction,
the other offers us the delicious illusions, the enchanting
tantalizations of desires, for ever veiled in
mystery.</p>

<p>But I must not attempt even to enter upon that
great study of my life, the poetry of organization.
Rather let me recall a dialogue between my restless,
roving, ideal-chaser Mondel, and the blonde Columbia,
which happened at their very second interview,
and some days before the scene of "quiet agitation"
which we described in a former chapter.</p>

<p>The encounter of two such minds as those of Columbia
and Mondel was peculiarly interesting, from
the opposing similarity of their characteristics.</p>

<p>They had arrived at a like&mdash;and yet how different
a result, by roads peculiar to each. Columbia, the
delicate student, devouring with intense ardor the
literature of past ages and of the modern time, even
to newspapers and reviews, had yet lived in comparative
seclusion from the world. She divined everything;
she understood life; she knew men, women
and their passions; she judged calmy, clearly, and
justly of life and its evils, with a sadness unembittered
by experience of personal suffering.</p>

<p>Mondel, on the other hand, the intellectual wrestler
with Life and Destiny, though essentially a student,
had seen, felt, and done enough since boyhood, to throw
all his reading in the shade. The observations on
men and manners he had found in books, had been
verified by fact. He knew more than he had read,
more than it was possible to learn by reading. He,
too, had pervaded the book world, and with the education
and strength of a <i>man</i>, read and digested
innumerable volumes, which, to Columbia, were
unknown. He had reached the Ultima Thule,&mdash;the
last stage of written progress,&mdash;and dashed into the
chaos beyond. He was a pioneer in the career of
thought, an originator, and no longer an absorber of
ideas.</p>

<p>Emancipated, at fifteen, by his transplantation to a
German university, he had travelled, fought, written,
speculated, with a restlessness that had enabled him
to sow in many fields, without yet reaping a harvest
in any. Thus he found himself with a scattered and
fragmentary reputation, an empty purse, and a
gloomy, discontented, desolate indifference to life,
on the verge of his thirtieth year, weary of a vain
search for an ever-flying happiness, and ready to welcome
death or any desperate adventure, as an escape
from apathy and monotony. But none can foresee
what change a single hour may operate in human
feelings. Mondel met Mrs. Yonkers, and her smiling
beauty suddenly made life vaguely tolerable. He
saw Columbia, her step-daughter, and lo! his heart
began to beat, his nerves to thrill, his eyes to brighten,
his soul to expand its drooping wings. In the
energy of that new sensation, his hope in the future
revived, his self-respect and confidence were restored;
he was again the man to face a dun or a dilemma
without faltering. In one day after that first
and memorable interview, during which the telegraph of
looks, vibrating nerves, and inflamed fancy, was the
only medium of communication between him and his
new-found idol, Mondel completed a poem, on which
he had concentrated his force, and in which he had
been long delayed by utter depression of spirits; wrote
half a dozen letters on business, which, for the time,
retrieved his apparently desperate finances; and projected,
as he lay in bed at night, a course of enterprising
<i>work</i>, which, if persevered in, would make
him, in the space of less than twelve months, comparatively
easy and independent in circumstances.</p>

<p>And all this was the result of an hour's interview
with a fair girl, and of one or two glances from a pair
of large, spiritual, blue eyes.</p>

<p>Talk of tonics! Why there is more power, in one
look of beauty, to revive the deadened brain of jaded
and despondent intellect, than all the tonics
in the world! Talk of poets writing under the influence of
champagne, not to mention gin and water! What
horrible and indescribable paltry nonsense! A touch
of the tip of <i>her</i> fingers, at parting, will carry with it
more electric vitality than all the vintage of Rhineland,
France, and Cyprus, not to mention Cozzen's
sparkling Catawba, from our own Ohio, which is
well worthy the rare honor of being sold by a poet!</p>

<p>"You are a great reader, Mr. Mondel," said Columbia,
on the occasion above referred to.</p>

<p>"No. I read little now. I am tired of reading,"
said Mondel, gravely.</p>

<p>"Tired  of  reading?" said the fair student. "How
<i>can</i> any one be tired of reading?"</p>

"Very easily, when books offer nothing but repetition
of familiar ideas. In order that the world
should progress, it is necessary to have students who
are students of something else than books."</p>

<p>"I understand; you philosophize?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. I have the same objection to philosophizing
that I have to reading. It is an endless
repetition."</p>

<p>"What do you do, then?&mdash;<i>dream</i>, perhaps," said
Columbia, with an arch smile.</p>

<p>Very few women, be it remarked, have any sense
of humor, especially of reined humor. It is a great
relief to find one who can appreciate a joke, that is,
not as broad as a cart-wheel. On the other hand,
they are far beyond men in comprehending the subtlest
delicacies of sentiment. Watch them at dramatic
representations: they will only laugh at the grossest
hits, yet be penetrated by the most shadowy nuance
of pathos.</p>

<p>Columbia was an exception to the rule. Her sense
of humor was keen; and no sooner did Mondel
make this delightful discovery, than she rose immensely
in his estimation. The fact is, humor is
essential to the reason. Causality and comparison
(to use phrenological nomenclature) give only sense
of sequence and resemblance; it is humor which,
giving us the perception of <i>differences</i> or contrasts,*
enables us to escape the hasty conclusions at which
people in whom this organ is weakly developed, are
perpetually arriving.</p>

<p>[*Vide Art. "National Humor," by the present writer in
late American (Whig) Review.]</p>

<p>All great men make jokes, and are born humorists.
It must be admitted that some distinguished personages
have had a particularly solemn style of joking.</p>

<p>To resume our dialogue.</p>

<p>"Dream!"  said Mondel&mdash;"of course I dream.
What would life be without dreaming? But dreaming
is involuntary. It is not logical to call dreaming
studying.</p>

<p>"Excuse my inexactness," said Columbia; "and
let me ask you plainly what you do, in place of reading,
to keep up your character as a student?"</p>

<p>"I observe facts and phenomena," replied Mondel.
"I read everywhere the book of Nature. I extract from
outward signs, the inward and spiritual grace. Chiefly
I read men, and, like a geologist or a chemist, classify
my specimens. Every variety of organization is
to me a new study&mdash;its characteristics the handwriting
of the fates. Every face is a dial&mdash;every feature
a cypher."</p>

<p>"And what is the object of this scientific criticism
of mankind?" said Columbia.</p>

<p>"Knowledge is power. To know men, is to rule
them."</p>

<p>"Then you aspire to rule?"</p>

<p>"I do not aspire. It is my nature. I love freedom
beyond all gifts of life. To be free, one must be
master; for are not all the world either slaves or
masters, spiritually or bodily?"</p>

<p>"Then," said Columbia, with restrained interest,
"you would govern men with your thoughts?"</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Yonkers," said Mondel, pausing,
"I perceive that I am becoming terribly egotistical,
and, besides, running the risk of being misunderstood.
Let us change the subject."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Columbia, eagerly. "<i>I</i> do not misunderstand
you. Go on."</p>

<p>"I really do not know," said Mondel, "why I
should speak to you as I have never spoken to perhaps
any living being before," and he looked with
earnest admiration into the eyes of Columbia for an
instant, then resumed his speech, before she had time
to feel embarrassed by this claim to exclusive sympathy.&mdash;"He
who takes the foremost steps in science,
must be followed by all men; therefore, he is the ruler
of the world. He who professes knowledge superior
to all other men, is thereby raised above all other
men; therefore, is spiritually their king. To aim
at the discovery of more important facts and higher
truths than have yet been known, is therefore the
highest ambition; and this is the ambition of the wise.
In this sense I would rule&mdash;nay, were it my destiny,
<i>must</i> rule&mdash;and in no other. I do not despise outward
forms of power, but I would never seek them,
by grovelling before the herd. Science, poetry, and
art are of themselves crowns to their votaries. The
student, the poet, and the artist, are kings, who give
from their individual wealth to the many. The political
ruler exists by sufferance, and owes his place to
the patience or fear of the people. When all the
world is educated, there will be no government but
public opinion, and stupid mediocrity will no longer
occupy presidential thrones or ministerial cabinets;
for there will be none to occupy."</p>

<p>"Your politics are strange enough, compared to
those of our stump orators," said Columbia.</p>

<p>"I am an anarchist," said Mondel. "I foresee
the downfall of all brute-force systems, and the reign
of pure reason and liberty. Suppose even, extravagant
as is the supposition, individualism substituted
for government to-morrow in this country, do you
imagine that we should turn barbarians, and cut one
another's throats? But, of course, I do not propose
any such abrupt change from the present to the new
system. All I say is, that I see the line which progress
must take in America."</p>

<p>"And what is to become of Europe?"</p>

<p>"We are to conquer it."</p>

<p>"To conquer Europe?"</p>

<p>"Yes; by our ideas and our wealth, if not by our
arms, and the revolt of its inhabitants.  Of course a
free Europe must be philosophically regarded as an
American conquest."</p>

<p>"And when do you think it will happen?" said
Columbia, much excited.</p>

<p>"Soon!" said Mondel, fixing his triumphant gaze
upon Columbia's sparkling eyes&mdash;"much sooner than
people dream of."</p>

<p>"How soon?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps within ten years. Ten years is a century
now, compared to the times of our fathers. Only
let the new storm of speculation pass over."</p>

<p>"What storm of speculation?"</p>

<p>"The Ocean Transit Company storm, which even
now looms in the horizon. It will leave railways and
Mississippi schemes in the rear; and, what is most
astonishing, it will end in no panic, but in universal
triumph. Yes!" said Mondel, warming with his
favorite subject. "Inventions have been made of late,
which, though temporarily neglected by the boobyism
of bloated capitalists, will soon <i>force</i> their way
into favor. Steam will be discarded, or used in an
improved way, fuel reduced to a nominal outlay, and
four or five days become the ordinary voyage to Europe,
not to mention that aerial transit will be put
into practice."</p>

<p>"What! is it possible to travel in balloons with
certainty?"</p>

<p>"Nothing is easier," replied Mondel. "The true
principle has been known to a  few  men of science for
years past. It is to rise and fall at angles produced
by reversible inclined planes. We must return to the
cheap and manageable means of ascent discovered by
Montgolfier, more than seventy years ago, from the
hydrogen gas of later innovation. The whole theory
and practice lies in a nutshell, and contains only two
propositions. Firstly, by means of a hot-air stove,
a balloon can be made to rise and fall at will. Secondly,
by means of inclined planes, it can be made to rise or
fall at any angle, according to the law of pressure in
fluids. Thus up and down hill, like the <i>Montagnes
Russes</i>, must be the course of the great California Air
Transit Company's balloons. Between each ascent and
descent, the impetus will enable a considerable motion
in a direct line; and the velocity of the locomotion
altogether, will render its indirectness of no
importance. The voyage to San Francisco will be
made in two or three days."</p>

<p>"But why is not the system carried out?"</p>

<p>"For want of means. Inventors have generally
little capital, and even their time is precious."</p>

<p>"But surely it would be easy to find some wealthy
men to advance funds."</p>

<p>"I do not know," said Mondel, smiling bitterly, "I
fancy, from my own experience, that they are rare.
Besides, men of high education and profound studies
do not like to go hat in hand to stupid merchants, who
cannot even understand the proposition that twice two
is four, except when the abstract number, two, is
reduced to the concrete two dollars."</p>

<p>"I should like to fly! I think it would be delightful,
but are you not too enthusiastic, Mr. Mondel?"</p>

<p>Mondel's face resumed an intenser pallor. "Not
in the least," he said, almost coldly; "but sometimes
I look forward into the future till I forget the present;
but I forget to despise mankind to the degree it
merits."</p>

<p>"I did not mean by enthusiastic, to say visionary,"
said Columbia, quickly, "I believe all you say. It is
in the ignorance of men alone that I see obstacles. I
love enthusiasm&mdash;I"&mdash;</p>

<p>At that moment Mrs. Yonkers came up, being
released from another gentleman's conversation. But
on that occasion she noticed nothing particular in the
manner of Columbia or Mondel. It was far otherwise
on the evening of the memorable exchange of looks.
No sooner was Mondel out of the house than Mrs.
Yonkers involuntarily began to expose the condition
of her own feelings by saying, with but half-concealed
acerbity, to her step-daughter: "Why Columbia, I
declare I think that you have fallen in love with Mr.
Mondel!"</p>

<p>Be it noted that Mrs. Yonkers did not suggest the
much more natural hypothesis, viz., that Mondel had
fallen in love with Columbia.</p>

<p>"Not at all, madam, not at all," replied Columbia,
with a careless haughtiness.</p>

<p>There was an instinct of refinement in the young
student, familiarized as she was, by reading, with the
manners of the great ladies of the old world, that
caused her to revolt against anything resembling a
direct personal attack, such as Mrs. Yonkers too often
indulged in. Mrs. Yonkers was of a sanguine temperament,
and could not understand that any bounds
were to be placed to the intimacy between herself
and one socially so nearly connected with her as her
step-daughter. As she had had the good sense never
to attempt to assert any sort of authority over Columbia,
Mrs. Yonkers good-naturedly set down sundry
quiet repulses she received from time to time, as mere
eccentricities of manner in her step-daughter.</p>

<p>"She is a curious girl," said Amelia to her old
friend, Miss Ross, "so cold, so reserved, and yet so
enthusiastic about poetry and music, and art, and all
that sort of thing. But, you know, too much literature
and criticism is a bore, and it is impossible to
get Columbia to talk about anything else. She is so
shy and reserved; do you know I have never heard
her say one word about love or marriage, or anything
of the sort, and yet, in that volume of tales she published
two years ago&mdash;'The Wizard's Book'&mdash;you
know"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Miss Ross, nodding with an
ominous air.</p>

<p>"In the 'Wizard's Book,'" resumed Amelia, "some
of the love-scenes are passionate enough, I think."</p>

<p>"Almost improper," said Miss Ross, in an undertone,
as if afraid of the remark being overheard, or
perhaps to give a mysterious solemnity to the insinuation.</p>

<p>Miss Ross, by the way, at the age of fourteen, had
been caught by her mamma with young Washington
Todds, two years her senior, under very suspicious
circumstances; and three years later had been desperately
in love with a young lawyer, who&mdash;but no
matter; Miss Ross was excessively particular and
severely set against anything that bordered on the
improper. Perhaps she knew what was improper
better than many other young ladies, and was therefore
an authority on the subject.</p>

<p>From this second digression, the reader will have
gained a piece of information, that Columbia was an
authoress. We must not imagine however, that her
book was as common-place as most young, and for
that matter, old ladies' books of the present age. On
the contrary, it was a production full of imagination
and wild beauty, far too subtly conceived to be ultra-popular,
and too artistically executed to be appreciated
by every-day critics. Although it had not
yet reached its "fiftieth thousand," it had sold well,
and had been favorably spoken of by some of the best
writers of the day.</p>

<p>"Do you think Mr. Mondel handsome?" said Mrs.
Yonkers, returning to the charge.</p>

<p>"I really do not know, he is very gentlemanly
and agreeable," replied Columbia.</p>

<p>"I think he admires you," said Mrs. Yonkers.</p>

<p>"Do you, indeed?" said Columbia.</p>

<p>"You had better be very careful with him, Columbia."</p>

<p>"I am always careful, madam."</p>

<p>"I am told he is very reckless and extravagant,
and not worth a cent."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear it, for <i>his</i> sake."</p>

<p>"He is not the sort of man your father would wish you
to encourage, I am sure."</p>

<p>"You think not?"</p>

<p>"I am certain he is not."</p>

<p>"Then why did you invite him to the house at all?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;because, in short, I merely thought
him&mdash;a very amusing person."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you. Good night. I am very
much fatigued."</p>

<p>"Good night, Columbia, think of what I have been
saying."</p>

<p>"I will," said Columbia quietly.</p>

<p>"She loves him, and he"&mdash;&mdash;Mrs. Yonkers
paused.</p>

<p>At this moment her husband entered.</p>

<p>"How late you are, Mr. Yonkers!"</p>

<p>"Don't look so cross, my dear," said the worthy
merchant, who was a little the worse for the wine he
had taken with some very particular friends at Delmonico's,
and Mr. Yonkers gave his wife an affectionate
kiss, with rather a maudlin expression.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she exclaimed, pushing him away with
disgust, "you have been drinking brandy&mdash;don't come
near me! Let me go to bed, I am very unwell this
evening."</p>

<p>"D&mdash;&mdash;d if she ain't always unwell, or something!"
muttered Mr. Yonkers, steadying himself by the back
of the rocking-chair, which gave a tilt, and nearly
upset him. Mr. Yonkers had begun to discover that
buying a white slave was not such a profitable investment
after all.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Columbia had ascended to her room,
closed and locked the door, turned up the gas, and
seated herself in a luxurious arm-chair before a table
covered with books. She took up one of them&mdash;it
was Mondel's "Logic of Life." She paused, with the
open volume on her knee.</p>

<p>"I do believe," murmured Columbia, "that my
step-mother is jealous. Is it possible that she can
seriously love him?&mdash;is it possible?&mdash;rather is it possible
that she should <i>not</i> love him? My father is old
enough to be her own. Can such marriages prosper?
O Mammon, Mammon, what fiery scourges canst thou
invent for thy victims! And <i>he</i>, does he, can he feel
any interest in her beyond ordinary friendship? But
no! how can she understand a soul like Mondel's.
To her he is&mdash;simply a handsome and agreeable man&mdash;whilst
to <i>me</i>, he is&mdash;I know not what&mdash;something
beyond all that I had yet dreamed of, something that
I can <i>look up to</i>. Oh, the desolation of superior
knowledge, the misery of the society of fools, the
loneliness of the ambitious spirits soaring in the cold
empyrean, without sympathy or companionship!"</p>

<p>Columbia paused and looked before her with a
vague dreaminess&mdash;unconsciously she imitated the
expression habitual to Mondel in his moments of
abstraction.  It is one of the phenomena of love,
well-known to the observant student of its manifestations.</p>

<p>Columbia's face was pale. Her hair and clearly
pencilled brows seemed dark by contrast with her
marble forehead and colorless cheeks. Her blue eyes
seemed to darken to the hue of the violet. Never
was seen beauty more noble, more spiritual.</p>

<p>"They think I am cold," she murmured; "they
think that because I recoil with horror from the contact
with the gross and silly men I see, that I am incapable
of love, of passion, of devoted idolatry! Oh, the
ignorance of the vulgar, who cannot see beyond the
wretched sphere which they inhabit!"</p>

<p>The young beauty rose and stepped before a mirror,
in which her whole form was reflected. She stood
there, tall, graceful, delicately voluptuous in the
rounded outlines of her neck, shoulders and bust,
from which she had now removed the lace, that till
then had shrouded their whiteness. She stood there
with an innocent, yet imperial pride, and in her
inmost heart, a little voice whispered, "For <i>his</i> sake,
I thank God that I am beautiful!"</p>

<p>When a woman of genius is beautiful, it is the
beauty of a celestial world. Woe to those who can
understand the beauty, and on whom its rays fall
coldly! Better never to have scaled the walls of
Paradise, and gazed upon its matchless delights, than,
having seen it, to be driven by the flaming sword of
the angel of despair into eternal darkness from its
precincts!</p>

<p id="c09">CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p>IN LOVE.</p>

</div>

<p>"I APPREHEND no danger to his life," said Dr.
Vortex, a young man of very lofty stature, with a fair
and most engaging countenance, which, like that of
his friends, Cope and Mondel, was dignified with a
well-trimmed beard.</p>

<p>"Will you not stay, doctor?  Here are some excellent
cigars and some real French brandy."</p>

<p>"No, thank you," said Vortex "I will take a
cigar, however, but I am expected by a patient."</p>

<p>"Or an <i>im</i>patient?" said Mondel smiling.</p>

<p>"I hope so," said the doctor, who was a young
married man, and still in love with his wife.</p>

<p>Enviable individual!</p>

<p>Mondel and Cope stepped together into the adjoining
room. There lay fast asleep the grim professor
of pugilism, looking very pale, with his bandaged
head and blue chin close shaven, after the custom of
his class.</p>

<p>"A strong fellow!" said Cope, pointing to the
muscular arm, which, owing to the want of a button
to the wristband, was lying half bared on the
coverlid.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt a desperate ruffian, according to
received ideas," said Mondel, as they returned to the
sitting-room. "However, you can easily imagine
that pure philanthropy did not decide me to encumber
myself with such a guest. The fact is, I was
afraid the row would lead to exposure, and get into
the papers; and just now I am on very delicate ground,
and wish to avoid everything that is disreputable."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"I have found a treasure&mdash;a real wonder of beauty
and intelligence&mdash;a girl such as I had hitherto met
only in dreams."</p>

<p>"Ha! you are in love, then?"</p>

<p>"Madly. To you, and you only, I must confide it.
But you shall see her, and judge for yourself."</p>

<p>"If I see her, I shall certainly do so. My eyes are
not yet crystallized over, whilst you already look
through prismatic glasses. You should read Henry
Beyle, <i>alias</i> Stendahl's, <i>Des l'amour</i>."</p>

<p>"Pray do not jest&mdash;the affair is too serious."</p>

<p>"It usually is."</p>

<p>"There are difficulties of the gravest kind."</p>

<p>"Not an uncommon accident. But what are your
special obstacles&mdash;want of money?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that is the least of them, though bad enough
in itself. Her father is immensely rich, whilst I, as
you know, have been immensely careless and dissipated.
However, I can soon recover myself, under
the inspiration of such a hope. But the fact is she
has a step-mother."</p>

<p>"A perverse old hag, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Not at all; a charming woman of five-and-twenty,
a few years older than Columbia."</p>

<p>"Columbia&mdash;a pretty name, national or dove-like,
as you like to take it," said Cope, intently studying
the rapt expression of Mondel's anxious countenance.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately; I paid this lady some little attentions&mdash;flattered
her perhaps a little too heavily."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; flattery is too broad or too exaggerated for
nine women out of ten," said Cope; "even if they do
not quite believe that you are in earnest, the idea
that you wish to please them is already pleasing.
There is only one kind of flattery that offends a
woman."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"To flatter her out of pity, and let her see that
you do so. But only boys under one or two and
twenty perpetrate such enormities."</p>

<p>"There is, I think, one other kind of flattery which
offends," said Mondel, "and that is to pay a woman
the compliment of speaking the truth to her, on the
supposition that she is too sensible to be deluded by
flattery!"</p>

<p>"It is indeed a dangerous experiment," said Cope;
"I tried it once."</p>

<p>"So did I," said Mondel.</p>

<p>"And the result?"</p>

<p>"An argument all on one side, that lasted a whole
evening. And yours?"

<p>"A hint that some people did not know that
their society was troublesome. Candor is a bore, and
I believe the woman was right after all."</p>

<p>"True; I should like to catch any one but a real
friend like yourself, or an angel like&mdash;somebody else&mdash;troubling
me with a candid opinion! But as I
was saying, I made Mrs. Yonkers, the lady in question,
believe that I was smitten. She is a fine woman,
a beautiful complexion, a large dark eye, a figure
such as would make the fortune of a 'model artist'&mdash;in
a word, the very embodiment of passionate
temptation. I was dying of <i>ennui</i>.  I looked all
sorts of things at her, rather languidly perhaps; but at
any rate not without effect. It was evident I pleased
her; her husband is old enough to be my father, fat
and red-faced, with grey whiskers. She asked me to
call. Of course I called, and&mdash;imagine my position!&mdash;she
introduced me to her step-daughter Columbia,
a perfect angel of light, and, as it proves, the most
accomplished, learned, gentle, noble, graceful, fascinating
woman in America!"</p>

<p>"By Jove!&mdash;a hard case," ejaculated Cope.</p>

<p>"But that is not all. Whenever madame can
speak to me alone, she makes love to me in the most
unmistakable manner. She tells me, in parables, how
unhappy she is; how she had no idea what marriage
meant when she was dragged into the Yonkers alliance;
how her life is a wreck&mdash;an <i>Inferno</i>; and
how marriage itself is an institution on a par with
the Spanish inquisition. She had read the works of
Stephen Pearl Andrews, and others, on the subject,
and tells me, confidentially, that there is no real marriage
but that of the soul. In this opinion, in the
abstract, I perfectly agree; but, as you perceive, I
am in a most painful position. It is almost impossible,
for my studiously polite efforts, to misunderstand her
allusions, and to prevent an explanation. She evidently
thinks that I am a modest man, who only requires
encouragement."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Cope, with a most unsophisticated
merriment. "Well, I must say; you are as
innocent-looking a <i>rou&eacute;</i> as I ever encountered, with
your mild, dreamy look. Sometimes I fancy, that if
you shaved, you might pass for a youth of the evangelical
persuasion, and a regular church-goer!"

<p>"I am not a <i>rou&eacute;</i>," said Mondel. "I am a&mdash;a&mdash;a <i>philosopher!</i>"</p>

<p>Cope laughed yet more heartily.</p>

<p>"Hell upon earth!" resumed Mondel, checking
Cope's merriment, by his earnestness, and pacing the
room in his excitement. "What miserable lives men
lead in this present accursed social organization!
With what difficulties are the noblest and mightiest
of our impulses surrounded! I look back on ten
years of manhood, and I see but six months&mdash;one-twentieth
part of the time&mdash;during which the first
elements of happiness were mine. You know how
<i>that</i> ended&mdash;in what a gulf of unhappiness and
despair it plunged me! Had I at that time possessed
the wealth which came too late to save me; but it
is over now. I am free. Whatever has been my
past, my present is my own. You know I have but
one dream which I cherish&mdash;love&mdash;love&mdash;eternal love
and fidelity. I have never yet been unfaithful, for
I have never loved but once; and then, you knew
my innocence. No, Cope! So much do I abhor the
wretched life of a roving <i>rou&eacute;</i>, that I would give my
whole future for a single year of true happiness and
sympathy."</p>

<p>"That is of Columbia?" said Cope, mildly.</p>

<p>"Yes! I confess. she is now all to me&mdash;world,
future, and hope. I cannot live without her. She
<i>must</i> be mine. Are we not made for one another?
Do we not sympathize in taste, in culture, in temperament?
See here, I bought her work to-day&mdash;'The
Wizard's Book.' Let me read you a few passages."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

</div>

<p>"Is it not splendid?&mdash;equal to George Sand or Bulwer?
What melody of style, what loftiness of
conception, what luxuriance of fancy!"</p>

<p>"It is very well written, indeed," said Cope, glancing
over the volume, which he had taken from the
hands of Mondel.</p>

<p>"Do you really think so?" said Mondel, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Really, on my honor," replied Peregrine, frankly.</p>

<p>"Because love is blind, you know," said Mondel.</p>

<p>"Yet, with all his blindness, the god often sees what
no one else can discern," said Cope, sarcastically.</p>

<p>"What! are you going?"</p>

<p>"I am quite tired out. I can scarcely keep my
eyes open."</p>

<p>"Ah, forgive me!" said. Mondel. "I forgot. You
are not in love with a Columbia. Now, <i>I</i> never feel
sleepy of late. I really seem never to sleep. But
you are still human."</p>

<p>"Good night," said Cope. "I leave you to your
divine afflatus."</p>

<p>The clock on the mantelpiece struck three.</p>

<p>"Good night. I will call on you to-morrow,"
said Mondel, as he sat down to the perusal of the
"Wizard's Book."</p>

<p>He little thought that at that same hour the blue-eyed
Columbia was yet watching over his own philosophical
treatise, "The Logic of Life," and mentally
adoring its author, with all the sublimity of virtue,
which he inculcated in such fascinating periods.</p>

<p>Thus love&mdash;intelligent, glorious, all-devouring love&mdash;had
sprung up in two young hearts, amid all the trees
of life and knowledge with which they had planted
the Edens of their creative imaginations. No wonder
that, when they slept, each was present to the
visions of the other.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in his lonely and mysterious habitation,
toiled one, whose love, if not so pure as that of our
two impassioned students, was, at least, as dominating
a law to his existence&mdash;Berkeley the <i>Alterer</i>.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p id="c10">CHAPTER X.</p>

<p>HOW TO MAKE MONEY.</p>

</div>

<p>BEYOND Thirtieth Street, and between the Eighth
Avenue and the river, in a neighborhood far removed
from all business, activity, or fashionable circulation,
stood the isolated house of John Berkeley. It was a
substantial red brick building, and had an iron railing
and small garden before it, in the English style.
Berkeley, on reaching this remote residence, after
parting from Mondel and his friends, opened the door
with his latch-key, and, at once, commenced the
ascent of the stairs. He did not pause till he reached
the landing of the third story, where a door, at the
foot of the next flight of stairs, which were narrower
than those below, barred further progress.</p>

<p>Since the carpenter put it up, no living mortal save
Berkeley had ever passed the threshold of that door,
nor would even the most cunning locksmith have
succeeded in picking the lock by which it was secured.
To  open the door, when unlocked, required the knowledge
of a secret, which could scarcely have been
<i>guessed</i> by one uninitiated in the mystery. It was
necessary to <i>lift</i> the door, in order to open it; otherwise
it remained secured, by a bar of wood at the
bottom, as firmly as ever.</p>

<p>When Berkeley had passed this formidable barrier
he carefully relocked the door, then struck a light
from a small box of wax-matches he carried, and,
passing a second door, which swung to by a weight,
entered a room which an instant later was illuminated
by the vivid glare of a large gas-burner, covered
by a large paper shade.</p>

<p>What a glorious invention is gas! It will seem
strange to Americans, but gas is very little used&mdash;indeed
scarcely at all&mdash;in private houses in Europe.
The Londoners, whilst freely burning it in their shops
and warehouses, have a silly prejudice against its use
in their drawing-rooms, or even in their counting-houses.
In the former they darkle miserably by the
glimmer of wax-tapers or "composites," which drop
on and spoil every piece of furniture; in the latter,
unhappy clerks still endure all the horrors of tallow,
and write by the smell as well as by the light of
"dips, four to the pound," or, as they call them in
the vernacular, "muttons." Now it became clear
to me that in a country where tallow candles were
still burned, political progress was impossible. No
wonder that in the "great metropolis" printers still
sweat away existence in working wretched hand-presses
that do not even ink themselves; and that
iced creams and cool breezes, produced by steam, are
utterly unknown to the limited intellect of benighted
Cockneydom.</p>

<p>A singular workshop was that of Berkeley.  On
every side of the large apartment, which occupied
nearly the whole story, were seen tables covered with
artists' and engravers' tools, and other materials,
shelves laden with bottles, a press of singular construction,
a photographic camera, a microscope, &amp;c.; in one
corner, on a small table, lay no less than three revolvers,
and a bowie-knife of sword-like dimensions, whilst
beneath the table stood a small barrel marked <i>gunpowder</i>.
Near one of the windows lay a coil of rope
securely fastened to a ring in the wall, as if to facilitate
escape by the window, in case of fire or other
peril. It was evident that this apartment was not
intended for the reception of visitors. A solitary
wooden arm-chair was the only means of repose it
offered. This, Berkeley; who was tired by his walk,
threw himself into, and lighting a seventeenth cigar
since his breakfast, fell into a train of meditation
sufficiently uncommon to be worth reporting, as the
"ghost-raisers" would say, by "spiritual telegraph."<p>

<p>"Art is long, and life is short;" thought Berkeley,
anxiously, "a man does not become the first forger
of his age in a day. Let me see. Five years ago I
began by altering bills, and, with the aid of a little
chemistry, I brought it to such perfection that I won
the admiration of every bank in the country. I
became <i>the</i> alterer <i>par excellence</i>, and by Phito! I
deserved the title. Since then I have done business
on a large scale. By reference to my book"&mdash;Berkeley
here referred to a ledger&mdash;"I have passed exactly
two hundred and ninety-five thousand seven hundred
and forty-three dollars of my own manufacture. Of
the proceeds I have invested some thirty-five thousand
dollars in town lots, which may now be worth
nearer eighty thousand. The balance I have squandered
in expenses, and in the process of passing.
Thanks to my caution, my disguises, and my resolution,
no accomplice has yet had it in his power to
betray me. But I have now dashed into the open
sea; I have taken 'sink or swim' for my motto. A
few months must decide my fate&mdash;Amelia and an
Italian palace, or despair and a grave of infamy!"</p>

<p>"A melodramatic finale!" assumed the Alterer
with a grim smile. "And now to work! I must
<i>make</i> ten thousand dollars before morning!"</p>

<p>The alterer had well said that forgery was an art
not to be learned in a day. More than four years
out of the five had been wasted by John Berkeley,
in the laborious task of altering bills (that is, changing
their denominations from one to ten, &amp;c.), and in
engraving plates, with prodigious patience, from
which to print counterfeits. As each of these plates
required a long time to engrave, it was necessary to
print off large numbers of the same bill, which was
not only very dangerous, but eventually frustrated
its own object.</p>

<p>Persevering investigation and industry, however,
will overcome all obstacles. A simple zincographic
press now enabled Berkeley, without any trouble, to
reproduce, at will, fac-similies of any bills issued.</p>

<p>As the reader may be interested in the application
of this curious art to other purposes than forgery, I
will here briefly describe the process.</p>

<p>Any engraving, lithograph, newspaper, writing or
drawing (in printer's or lithographic ink), can be
immediately transferred, by pressure, from the paper
to a smooth sheet of zinc, from which, as from a
lithographic stone, impressions can at once be taken.
I have seen copies of "Punch," and the "Illustrated
London News," reproduced with absolute exactness,
as, also, autograph sketches and writings of my own,
both by the pen and crayon.*  All that is necessary,
therefore, to reproduce any number of bank-bills, is
to get new and clean copies free from grease-spots,
which would otherwise cause spots in the impression,
and give much trouble.</p>

<p>[*Zincography is, so far as I know, practised in New York only
by Mr. Hohneck, 168 Hester street.]</p>

<p>The plate of zinc which Berkeley now placed on
the press, contained impressions of no less than sixteen
different bills&mdash;the very best, in point of credit,
in the city. His paper being ready damped, and the
red portions already printed, our scientific counterfeiter
deliberately proceeded to ink the plate with a
roller, and slowly to print off about one hundred
sheets, equal in nominal value to more than ten thousand
dollars, of illegal money. The process of cutting
up and separating the bills was performed in a few
minutes by another machine, and the <i>Alterer</i>&mdash;whose
alterations were now <i>radical</i>&mdash;held in his hands as
nice a looking pile of bills as ordinary critics would
wish to see in their profession. Another hour devoted
to the process of crumpling, dirtying, greasing,
and tearing the bills, with the assistance of a small
dust-bin and a jar of butter, into an appearance of
decent antiquity and indistinctness, and&mdash;the
manufacture was perfect.</p>

<p>But do not let the facility with which ten thousand
dollars in bank bills can be forged, tempt any unscrupulous
person to embark in so ridiculous a pursuit as
forgery. Forgery is like murder, which De Quincey
has so ably treated as "one of the fine arts;" it leads
to every description of meanness. It is a life of fear,
anxiety, and hideous degradation. It is perpetual
unrest. I never knew a man who launched out into
forgery or its kindred sciences&mdash;such as frauds in
connection with railway scrip, for example&mdash;who ever
seemed to enjoy a happy existence, even if spared by
the law. Hudson, the English "railway king," is
shunned like a pestilence by every honorable man.
True gentlemen in the House of Commons get up and
move from his neighborhood; and, despite all his ill-gotten
wealth, his name is never mentioned without
contempt. Schuyler, of New York, who issued the
false scrip to such an enormous extent, the other day,
will henceforward have to skulk about obscurely, and
associate with swindlers and thieves. Most unenviable
is the life of the imprudent rascal, enriched by
unorthodox roguery. He is spunged on by rogues
poorer and less daring than himself&mdash;the vilest of the
vile. He is liable to be scorned and insulted at
every turn, by the disdain of those who, at least,
cheat their fellows according to rule. In short, no
sensible rascal should take a more direct cut to robbery
than bankruptcy, which, periodically arranged,
answers well enough in some lines of business.</p>

<p>A curious reminiscence here occurs, to serve as
illustrative of the class of speculations to which
forgery pertains: it is the case of Captain Marshall,
the check-giver. This notorious character, who may
have many <i>aliases</i>, is a man of middle height, moderately
stout, fifty years of age, with a mild, good-humored
face, who occasionally professes himself a
pious convert to Catholicism, and will discuss, at
length, on his pride in his profession&mdash;the nautical&mdash;and
a new invention for reefing topsails from below.</p>

<p>He goes about&mdash;probably some of our readers may
have heard of him&mdash;living at the best hotels, and
paying <i>by check</i>. Now and then he catches a green-horn,
who cashes a small draft on a banker in the
next city, of importance. He knows everybody you
know, and is very unobtrusive, being especially dexterous
in making your acquaintance, by means apparently
accidental. Having already availed myself
of the electric telegraph and the post-office&mdash;too late,
however, to save my erewhile host and his bill, I rejoice
at being enabled, by a <i>novel</i> medium, to increase
the celebrity of this remarkable man.  <i>This
little check on the Bank of Utica, Buffalo</i>,  I still
preserve, for the sake of the autograph. But why
should I complain? Do I not owe to that insignificant
loss the gain of one of the most remarkable
spectacles I ever witnessed?</p>

<p>It is an unwarrantable digression; but, digression
or no digression, the incident shall be related.</p>

<p>It was at Niagara Falls. I had stayed over Sunday
at Buffalo, in order to present the Captain's check on
Monday morning. All was excitement at the hotel.
A man was in the rapids!</p>

<p>I hastened to the bridge above the Falls.</p>

<p>"You cannot pass, sir."</p>

<p>"I am the editor of the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pass on."</p>

<p>The word editor is an "open Sesame" in America,
and, indeed, in most civilized countries.</p>

<p>"Oh, let me pass. I <i>must</i> pass!" cried the voice
of a female behind me.</p>

<p>"You really cannot, miss," said the sentinel.</p>

<p>"But I <i>must!</i>" replied a voice of anguish.</p>

<p>"No one is allowed on the bridge, but those who
are assisting to let down the boats," said the sentinel.
"You really cannot come. We <i>must</i> keep the bridge
clear."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," cried the girl, a fair and pretty creature,
with large hazel eyes, seeing that I had turned back
to look at her, "get me through,&mdash;for God's sake, get
me through!"</p>

<p>Struck by her deep agitation, I said to the man,
"Let her pass," and as I pressed against the human
barrier, she slipped through and seized my arm. The
scene which presented itself from the bridge was most
appalling. Before us, at the distance of perhaps less
than a quarter of a mile, was the crystalline edge of
the cataract. On the right bank, between the fall
and the bridge, were thousands of people staring in
impotent horror. In the centre of the rapids, and
about half way between the bridge and the cataract's
margin, was a log jammed between two rocks. It is
still there. On this log stood a man erect, and distinctly
visible. There he had been since the previous
night. It was now five in the afternoon. He had
fallen asleep in his boat, the boat had been carried
away by the current, and had probably struck against
the log on which he had saved himself. The roar of
the rushing, foaming waters rendered it useless to
shout for assistance. In the morning he was discovered
standing where he now stood in temporary security,
yet almost beyond the possibility of escape.
Boats had been floated down with ropes attached to
them, containing provisions and brandy. They had
all failed in their mission; the overstrained ropes had
given way, and the boats had disappeared over the
fatal line of the fall. Nothing remained to be tried
but a strong raft, though every one agreed that it was
at best but a shadow of a chance. Such as it was, I
urged its immediate employment, and, briefly representing
the utter folly of delay, aided with my own
hands to lower it into the boiling torrent. Alas! a
few minutes had not elapsed before one of the ropes,
by which it was guided, was fairly torn from our
hands, and the raft drifted guideless amid the eddies.
I looked around for my companion, whom I had quitted
to aid in letting down the raft. She was requesting
a gentleman to lend her a telescope, through
which he was regarding the unfortunate man in the
rapids. He handed it to her with politeness. She
took one look, then dropped the telescope, and
exclaimed, staggering as if shot&mdash;"It is he&mdash;O,
God, it is he!"</p>

<p>She would have fallen, had I not caught her in my
arms. I, myself, looked through the telescope, and
beheld the pale, anxious, yet still courageous countenance
of a young man of two-and-twenty, of handsome
and pleasing appearance.</p>

<p>One more attempt was made. We formed a second
raft of the rudest materials, obtained a fresh supply
of rope, and this time, by wonderful fortune, succeeded
in letting it float down to the log. In a few minutes
it was there. The young man scrambled upon
it, but his strength was evidently exhausted. It was
hoped that the raft might be so guided as to
run ashore on Goat Island, which unequally divides the
river above the cataract. I may mention, for the
benefit of such of my readers as have never visited
Niagara, that to draw back anything <i>against</i> the torrent
of the rapids at that point is impossible. But all
speculation on the subject was soon at an end. The
man was suddenly swept from the raft, and carried
with awful velocity towards the fall.  For one instant
he managed to stand erect and utter a wild shriek, on
the very edge of the abyss, then he had vanished forever.</p>

<p>Those near at hand, affirmed that the word he
uttered was "<i>Mary!</i>"</p>

<p>More audible was the shriek of Mary herself, as
witnessing the last agony of her lover, she fell senseless
at my feet.</p>

<p>As soon as I had seen the poor girl placed in the
care of friends, I hastened to the foot of the fall, and,
heedless of the spray which wetted me to the skin,
peered curiously into the infernal cauldron of
waters.</p>

<p>But it is as wise to ask of oblivion the fate of the
passing hours, as to ask of savage Niagara the bodies
of his victims. Ten thousand years ago, that awful
torrent fell, broken by the immense descent into
snow-like particles, even as it now falls&mdash;of all spectacles
which Nature offers, the most enthralling and
the most sublime. Yet, for me, the solemn grandeur
of the giant falls is for ever painfully mingled in
memory with the hideous vision of the "man in
the rapids," and the shriek of his despairing mistress.</p>

<p>Thus to Captain Marshall's check on a bank
in which he never deposited one cent, I was indebted
for a remarkable adventure, and the reader for a
curious anecdote.</p>

<p>But, I was saying that forgery and ultimate misery
go together. The fact is, all crime, save personal
violence, is fundamentally falsehood. The greater
the lie, the greater the injury to mankind, and the
heavier mankind's resentment. The petty shop-keeper
who adulterates his goods, who sells <i>forged</i> coffee,
<i>forged</i> pepper, <i>forged</i> brandy, &amp;c., is a more contemptible,
but less dangerous rascal than your Fauntleroy,
your Hudson, or your Schuyler.</p>

<p>John Berkeley was a bolder, but perhaps not
morally, a more corrupt man, than two out of three
traders in Wall Street, or nine out of ten politicians at
Washington. He had taken to a by-way for fleecing
his fellows, instead of the beaten track, that was all.
And quite enough for any honest man. But who is
honest in this world? Who, but the man who <i>works</i>,
and gives a fair equivalent for what he asks of the
world. For the rest, it may be an error of judgment,
but I see little difference, in a rational point of view,
between the tyrant who oppresses, the speculator who
extorts, and the brigand who robs; or between the
brokers and bankers who, by their nefarious trickery,
raise stocks and shares to an artificial value, and the
less particular counterfeiter, who creates fictitious
value altogether. Mankind at large is equally a
sufferer by either.</p>

<p>I do not defend John Berkeley. I admit that he is
a scoundrel. But he plays his game like the rest, and
chooses his risk with the odds against him. In proportion
to the risk is the gain. Now, if John Berkeley
had counterfeited opinions, or levied black-mail
as a journalist, if he had palmed off pretended medicinal
panaceas as a quack doctor, if he had raised sham
ghosts as a spiritual medium, or exhibited counterfeit
woolly horses as a showman, he would have engaged
much less hazardous line of business. But, as we
have seen, John Berkeley simply took to forging bank-bills;
and, on the morning after the night of the fracas
with his myrmidons, sallied out in search of Confidence
Bob and the Slinker, with ten thousand newly
created dollars in his pocket. As he went out, he
was grinned at with the most sincere affection by an
ugly old negress with a big head, and feet like a
duck. She was his only servant; and, though her
master rarely honored her by remembering the fact
of her humble existence, was simply and devotedly
attached to the man who, for five long years, had provided
her with food, shelter, and clothing&mdash;requirements
to which poor Peggy had in her early life been
but too often a stranger. Perhaps she was the only
real friend John Berkeley possessed in the world.</p>

<p>STRANGE TALK.</p>

</div>

<p>AS a new superstition is fostered by persecution,
so a young love becomes enhanced by obstacles.</p>

<p>Mondel loved Columbia, and Columbia loved Mondel.
Day and night the image of each was present
to the other. In mutual deification, both were intoxicated
with happiness.</p>

<p>Never had ocean-sprung Venus two nobler, two
more ecstatic votaries.</p>

<p>Revived by the elixir of passion, Dudley Mondel
saw the clouds of disappointment and the shadows
of experience pass away like vapors before the rising
sun. His imagination became purified. The grosser
illusions of his reckless and adventurous youth dimmed
into half-forgotten nightmares, feeble phantoms of
unpleasant waking dreams. His will became once
more strong and imperial. His courage and his hope
once more bade defiance to the world.</p>

<p>He was again prepared to renew, on the highest
plane of existence, that gigantic struggle which genius
for ever maintains, by her knightly champions, with
the falsehood and ignorance of the universal spiritual
chaos.</p>

<p>"How little," said Mondel, "is the mission of the
man of genius comprehended by the herd! An
incarnate god, he stamps his law and effigy upon the
brow of humanity for all coming time. He reveals a
truth, he discovers a principle, he combines an idea,
and all eternity receives it! Every day he is nearer
his kingdom. Even now he laughs aloud at the fools
who sit on thrones or presidential chairs, in ministerial
cabinets, and boast that they are <i>governing</i> the earth.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, the true kings of men, the kings of
thought, invent, foretell, predestine things to be,
securely seated in the Olympus of their science.</p>

<p>"'But I use you,' cry the despot and the worldling.</p>

<p>"'You obey me,' says the thinker.</p>

<p>"'You think for me&mdash;you are my slave,' says the
political ruler.</p>

<p>"'You act upon my thought. I am your master,'
says the philosopher.</p>

<p>"'You work&mdash;I enjoy,' says government.</p>

<p>"'I plan&mdash;you execute,' says science.</p>

<p>"In fine, government is merely a focus, by means
of which the rays of the lamp of genius are to be
brought to bear upon a nation. As soon as the press
shall be sufficiently developed, and photographic
printing perfected, genius will no longer require
government as a medium, because it will have the
means of transmitting all its decrees straight to the
intelligence of every citizen. In those days, public
opinion will be government, and every man will represent
his own opinions, when he has any to represent,
by simply expressing them openly."</p>

<p>"But how is crime to be suppressed?" said Columbia,
timidly.</p>

<p>"In a very advanced state of society, which demands
that the freedom of the individual should be
perfect, and entirely unshackled by external force,
there would be no crime, save as a rare exception.
Law, existing only as an idea in the mind of every
citizen, and a philosophical education rendering that
disease of brain, which produces the anti-rational
abortion, called crime, extremely uncommon, there
would be so few occasions for society to apply personal
restraint to the individual man, that each
emergency could readily find its own tribunal."</p>

<p>"Still, suppose that in the absence of an executive
government, men were to unite together, and form
bands of robbers?"</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Columbia," said Mondel, smiling,
"you forget that twenty years hence every one will
be armed with an air-gun, or revolver, loaded by a
turn of a screw, and that poverty, in the sense of
actual privation, will have no existence; therefore,
the motive for so hazardous a defiance of society; nonexistent."</p>

<p>"Do you really believe that want will cease to
exist?" exclaimed Columbia, with a radiant expression
of benevolence and goodness, that made her
look like an angel about to take wing.</p>

<p>Mondel, with difficulty repressing an insane desire
to defy propriety and Mrs. Yonkers, by clasping Columbia
to his heart, and kissing her a thousand times,
replied, trembling with contending feelings:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. It must end at last!  In this country,
at least, even the trading classes will at length rise
above the revolting meanness and stupidity of fostering,
instead of preventing crime. What is crime?
Mental disease, produced by want of the necessaries
of life. These necessities are food, shelter, clothing,
and love. The man who is precluded, by poverty,
from the simple gratification of his appetites, to the
degree required by a sound mind, in a sound body,
becomes necessarily a degraded being&mdash;a criminal.</p>

<p>"Ages of selfishness, ignorance, and poverty, have
created a standing army of these outcasts, perpetually
recruited from the ranks of starving laborers of every
kind. In America, emigration furnishes ready-made
hordes of vagabonds, as a nucleus for the home production
of the same human vermin. In New York
and Philadelphia, the horrors of London and Paris are
beginning to reappear, accompanied by the same
senseless luxury and extravagance, and the same
fiendlike selfishness and indifference to the welfare of
the community as a whole. I have often said it
before&mdash;harsh as it may sound to 'ears polite,'&mdash;the
rich people, who let poor people suffer actual want
in their neighborhood, are criminal to the last degree.
The wealthy merchants of New York could easily
provide funds for distributing the continually-increasing
amount of superfluous labor accumulating in this
city, over the whole country, which their work would
enrich and cultivate. When people are utterly destitute,
a few days reduces them to the brink of starvation.
<i>Gratuitous locomotion</i> is the greatest boon
which wealth can give to poverty. The English poor-rates,
invested in steam navigation, would suffice, in
a couple of years, to remove every able-bodied pauper
from the soil of Great Britain, and to give every pauper
emigrant an outfit for the New World. But British
statesmen, in the decline of the monarchy, and on
the eve of revolution, can only imagine such things;
and American statesmen have not yet learned the
one great and simple lesson in political economy,
that pauperism is the one thing&mdash;the only thing&mdash;to
be dreaded in a Republic."</p>

<p>"Your words imply some result which I do not
precisely see," said Columbia.</p>

<p>"They imply," answered Mondel, "that liberty and
pauperism cannot long co-exist. If meanness and
grasping selfishness are not checked in America, by
loud, bold, and reiterated warnings, American liberty
will soon degenerate into oligarchy, and thence into
despotism. Already we have a race of pauper politicians
and corrupt intriguers, who pander basely to
the lowest rabble&mdash;the Irish emigrants and German
hucksters. Were it not that I foresee a revolution in
these United States, before many years are over,
which will annihilate the representative system and
all its delusive jugglery, I should despair of America
ever becoming anything but an overgrown England.
As it is, we march towards changes little dreamed of
in the philosophy of Washington senators and New
Hampshire generals!"</p>

<p>"And slavery?" said Columbia, "how is slavery to
be abolished?"</p>

<p>"It will abolish itself," said Mondel.</p>

<p>"By what means?"</p>

<p>"By the free will of the slave-holders."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"They are men, and must progress in intelligence
like the rest of the world. What the abuse of the
abolitionists has failed to do in so many years, their
own reason may do in one. No such absurdities as a
fugitive slave law can exist long in the North, and
without it where are the slavers?  American slavery
is like the English national debt; it must walk the
plank before long, however unpleasant may be the
operation to the holder of stock in either iniquity."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mrs. Yonkers, "I never can understand
your political regenerators, who wish to upset everything.
I find things very comfortable as they are. I
am sure I wish everybody to be happy, and I never
go out that I do not give away at least a quarter in
sixpences to poor little crossing-sweepers; but there
will always be some poor people, I suppose, in the
world."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mondel, "there will be probably poor
people even in the next world&mdash;people who cannot
afford a comet to live in during the dull season."</p>

<p id="c12">CHAPTER XII.</p>

<p>MORE LOVE.</p>

</div>

<p>MONDEL no longer even temporized with the infatuation
of Mrs. Yonkers. With a studied calmness, an
almost severe gravity, he baffled all her attempts to
draw him into a conversation of a personally embarrassing
nature.</p>

<p>"I feel very ill," Mrs. Yonkers would say, when he
called, as he did nearly every evening, to catch a few
moments' stolen conversation with, and a great many
stolen glances from his now adored Columbia.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry to hear it," Mondel would reply,
with polite yet sufficiently cordial sympathy.</p>

<p>"Are you <i>really</i> sorry?" Mrs. Yonkers would say,
with a vague air of sentimental reproach.</p>

<p>"I am not a hypocrite&mdash;I never knelt in a pulpit,"
Mondel would reply, quite coolly.</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that Mondel could not endure the
sight of a clergyman, and would rather have dined
with a pirate than with a bishop. It was one of his
weaknesses.</p>

<p>Mondel was not a church nor chapel-going man.
However, I do not hold him up as an example&mdash;I do
not pretend to be a moralist. I describe life as I
know and see it, that is all.</p>

<p>"This is a stupid world," again Mrs. Yonkers
would begin, shaking back her dark ringlets from her
white shoulders, with an air of languid disdain.</p>

<p>"Very," acquiesces Mondel.</p>

<p>"It is so full of cold, selfish people, that for my
part, I almost doubt the existence of love or affection
anywhere!" said the lady, desperately resolved to
despair of humanity without reserve.</p>

<p>"I often doubt it myself," says Mondel, stealing a
side glance at the door to see whether Columbia is
entering.</p>

<p>"You must find it very lonely, Mr. Mondel, with
all your deep poetical feelings?"</p>

<p>"Poets are a shocking race of impostors," replies
the poet to this <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>.</p>

<p>"But surely you have felt the passions and sentiments
you describe, or poetry is"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"All humbug, in nine cases out of ten," replies the
would-be cynic.</p>

<p>"Then Famosina is"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"A myth."</p>

<p>"Metafusa?"</p>

<p>"A joke."</p>

<p>"Colorissa?"</p>

<p>"An allegory."</p>

<p>"Why dear me! Mr. Mondel, I give you my
word, I took them to be all real ladies you had
known, and"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Me, to be&mdash;a most fortunate man?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps a very wicked one."</p>

<p>"Not at all. All my heroines are mere spectres
of the halls of fancy."</p>

<p>"And Fantasma&mdash;Fantasma, your last idealization,
who eclipses all others, as the sun eclipses the planets
in brightness, <i>she</i> surely has something real about
her?"</p>

<p>"No, she is merely a type&mdash;an impersonation of
Fancy itself&mdash;the most unreal of all."</p>

<p>Mondel had denied his enchantresses of by-gone
years, as pictured in his passionate verses, with as
little remorse as a sculptor feels in smashing his
juvenile Venuses. But when it came to repudiating
the vitality of Fantasma&mdash;Fantasma, in whose dream-like
beauty and prismatic radiance he had always
enshrined the blonde Columbia, his eternal queen and
goddess, he blushed faintly, and, felt the twinge of a
St. Peter-like pang in doing what seemed to be very
much like denying not his master, but his mistress.</p>

<p>But he was resolved to keep carefully within the
limits of the Arabia Petr&aelig;a, or Stony Arabia of sentiment
with his enamored friend; since, well he
knew that one false step might seriously interfere
with his projected trip to the Arabia Felix or happy
land, of which Columbia was the imperial hostess.
Of wanderings in the Arabia Deserta, of parching
thirst in the sandy desert of doubt, and error, and
hope long deferred, and of pilgrimages to the black
stone of Despair's Caaba, Mondel dreamed not at all.
Happily for mortals, <i>to-morrow</i> is an eternal mystery.</p>

<p>Many weeks after her first introduction to the
reader, Columbia entered the drawing-room already
mentioned, dressed for the theatre. It was the first
night of Mondel's new comedy. Mrs. Yonkers and
Columbia were to accompany the author to his private
box, where Mr. Yonkers had promised to join
them. Not that any one supposed he would
come. Mr. Yonkers had of late grown very undomesticated.
In fact, he began to feel himself more
at home anywhere than in his own house, where his
wife's intense coldness and politeness created for him
a freezing atmosphere, in which he found neither
enjoyment nor excitement. He tried at first a few
matrimonial quarrels with Amelia, but she so evidently
did not care a straw whether he was displeased
or not, that he gave up the attempt as hopeless, and
took to publicly acting the part of a very happy husband,
and patting his wife's shoulder in the presence
of friends, to make them believe that Mrs. Yonkers
and himself were living on the most affectionate
terms. I know nothing more ridiculous than an old
fool who thinks he can make the world believe that
the young wife he has bought with his money, is in
love with his elderly personality. Stay!&mdash;I know one
thing more ridiculous; it is an old fool who is jealous
of his slave, and thinks it possible to watch her. As
if a girl of sixteen were not a match for a whole regiment
of old fogies, at any time! With a woman of
six-and-twenty there is no game at all; the advantages
are too enormously one-sided. The old slaver is
nowhere!</p>

<p>Columbia entered the drawing-room. Mondel was
already there. Mrs. Yonkers was dressing. In her
ambition to outshine her rival in her toilette, she gave
the lovers an opportunity for a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, almost the
only one they had ever enjoyed. For the first few
minutes they were silent. Mondel had so much to say
that he could say nothing. It was Columbia who
broke the silence first.</p>

<p>"Are you not very anxious, Mr. Mondel, to see
your comedy realized on the stage?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least;" said Mondel, "I have not even
attended a rehearsal."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?&mdash;surely you cannot be indifferent
to the success of your work?"</p>

<p>"Indifferent to success, Miss Columbia? Oh, no; I
am not <i>indifferent</i> to success&mdash;perhaps partly because
a blind self-confidence assures me that success is certain&mdash;chiefly,
however, because all minor successes
are at present for me merged in the one grand object
of my life."</p>

<p>"And that object?" said Columbia, trembling and
changing color.</p>

<p>"That object," said Mondel, in a voice so deep, yet
clear and audible, that it seemed to come from the
very inmost centre of his being, "that object is <i>yourself</i>."</p>

<p>Columbia started, like a frightened fawn; the earnest,
concentrated passion of her lover's look alarmed
her delicate and over-sensitive nature. Her own wild
feelings alarmed her. She appeared about to fly.
Already she had retreated some paces.</p>

<p>Quick as lightning, yet without any violent movement,
Mondel stood again before her, took her hand
in his, and looking down, with an expression of
almost sombre scrutiny, into her magnificent blue
eyes, said, simply&mdash;"I love you."</p>

<p>"He loves me," thought Columbia&mdash;"he loves
me! How strange, how wonderful!"  And yet the
confession did not surprise her. She even expected
it.</p>

<p>There was no reproof in the look Columbia gave,
but something so weird, so unusual, so spiritual, that
the naturally audacious Mondel completely lost courage
for the moment. His impulse was to throw his
arm round her slender waist, to seal the confession
of his passion on her lips. But he dreaded to offend
a being so refined, so utterly unsensuous. He could
only look, with that searching, eternal, mysterious
gaze, peculiar to himself, and murmur, in a broken
voice, "It is my life I place in your hands. I wait
my sentence."</p>

<p>"Not now, not now," said Columbia, in deep
emotion.</p>

<p>"You do not hate me&mdash;I mean, I am not absolutely
repulsive to you?"</p>

<p>"No, no! I like you as a friend&mdash;I admire your
genius; but I must have time to reflect."</p>

<p>"I can wait," said Mondel, sadly.</p>

<p>Columbia was seized with a vague panic. The idea
of marriage had for her a sort of fantastic horror.
She loved, but feared to surrender her will to another.
Again, her woman's instinct had divined the secret
of her step-mother's unhappy fancy. The fair poetess
recoiled from a <i>d&eacute;no&ucirc;ment</i>. Her pride and modesty
also refused to allow that she had been so rapidly
and easily conquered.</p>

<p>It is strange to contemplate the difference between
the mental condition of a man and a woman, who
love, in the present state of society. The man has
seen, experienced all; the woman knows nothing but
in theory. The man's passions are fully developed;
the woman's often yet slumber in mysterious unconsciousness.
The man is all ardor, the woman one-half
misgiving. Thus, Mondel had lived; Columbia
had only dreamed.</p>

<p>"Alas!" thought Mondel, "how well I know that
the chances are millions to one against my ever
meeting a second Columbia, while she probably pictures
to herself a world in which such men as I are
common as the shells upon the sea-shore. And what
am I, after all, with all my reading, my intellectual
power, and my boundless daring, but a jaded man of
pleasure, a reckless desperado, compared to this pure
and radiant flower of beauty? How can I hope to
exchange love upon equal terms with one whose personal
advantages, as a woman, are so immeasurably
beyond my own as a man? Doubtless I am handsome
enough for Mrs. Yonkers, for any ordinary
beauty, but, to such angelic loveliness as Columbia's,
how rude a creature I must seem!" And poor Mondel
glanced ruefully at a glass, in which his stern, pale
features and athletic form were miserably reflected,
owing to the unevenness of the mirror's surface.</p>

<p>"Decidedly," thought he; "I must appear anything
but attractive to the imagination of a delicate
girl. Besides, I begin to look quite old, and my
complexion grows positively cadaverous. In asking
her to love me, I perhaps ask what is unreasonable."
So, calling pride to his aid, Mondel shook off all tenderness
from his aspect, and advanced to meet Mrs.
Yonkers, who then entered, with the stately mien of
a conqueror. Defeated, as he believed himself, he
resolved at least to betray no external sign of weakness,
and, with a burning heart, looked more cold and
haughty than he had ever looked before. Columbia,
witnessing this change, longed to say something which
might soften the effect of her former expressions, and
even Mrs. Yonkers was amazed at the unusual indifference
of her non-admiring friend, not to her own,
but to her step-daughter's attractions. Still more was
Mrs. Yonkers amazed to observe that Mondel took no
interest in the representation of his own piece, notwithstanding
the unbounded favor with which, from
first scene to last, it was received.  At the fall of the
curtain, Columbia turned to Mondel with such a
bright look of triumph in the applause which greeted
<i>his</i> work, that his doubts for the moment were utterly
dissipated, and pressing her hand, unobserved by the
rest of the party; with tears starting to his eyes, he
whispered, softly "May I hope?"</p>

<p>And Columbia's voice almost inaudibly murmured
back like a far-off echo&mdash;"<i>Hope</i>."</p>

<p>That night Mondel gave a late supper to his
friends, and as the champagne corks flew, O'Bouncer
cried, "Why, Mondel, my dear fellow, how changed
you look. The success of your play has made you
five years younger!"</p>

<p>But Peregrine Cope made no such blunder. He
knew that love alone had power to work so great an
alteration in his friend, and said to himself as he filled
his glass, "By Jove, Columbia has accepted him!"</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p>GREEN-EYED NEMESIS.</p>

</div>

<p>AMELIA was not a woman to be scorned with impunity.
She saw that Mondel did not love her, and
reluctantly admitted that he adored Columbia.</p>

<p>Enraged as she was, she could not teach herself to
feel indifferent towards the man who had so completely
subjugated her imagination. But if she
could not hate Mondel, she could and did hate the
idea of his possession by Columbia, and to frustrate
that union became now the most immediate object
of her excitable nature.</p>

<p>Her feelings towards Columbia were of a very
strange and complex nature. As a rival she hated
her step-daughter. As a woman, Amelia could not
resist the wonderful power of fascination possessed
by Columbia.</p>

<p>This power of fascination is the gift only of few.
It is a most rare and wonderful quality, depending
for its existence on the possession of exquisitely
reined sympathies. It betokens some moral superiority
difficult to analyze, yet of tremendous influence
on all minds that come within its sphere. It
is generally one of the prerogatives of supreme beauty
and genius. It is accompanied even in the
vicious by an internal harmony, a grand self-reliance.
It is in itself a main element of greatness.</p>

<p>Columbia fascinated every one with whom she
came in contact, under circumstances of intimacy.
In spite of herself, Mrs. Yonkers was nervously
anxious to have the good opinion and affection of her
step-daughter. Secretly; she felt the immense gulf
between her own superficial brilliance and Columbia's
dazzling acquirements. Nevertheless she had
conceived, since the visits of Mondel had commenced,
a gradually increasing dislike for her former idol.
The thought of such happiness as she
felt would be the portion of Mondel and Columbia,
if united, was more than she could bear. Devoured
by passion, jealousy and mortification, she said
fiercely to herself, "That marriage shall never be!&mdash;never
whilst I am alive to oppose it by means fair or&mdash;otherwise!"
And the jealous woman took a half
timid glance into the most evil depths of her own
nature, and beheld there shadowy possibilities which,
if distinctly revealed, even to herself, at that time,
would have terrified her by their hideousness.</p>

<p>The descent of Avernus is facile, but it is gradual
at least with the ordinary run of mortals. It is only
great evil geniuses who plunge abruptly into the
murky gloom of the nether world of thought, like
suicides who dash into death, and by a moment's
awful resolution cut through the entanglements of a
life-time.</p>

<p>But to effect her object Amelia required an accomplice.
Nor was she long in finding one both able
and willing to assist her.</p>

<p>This dangerous ally was John Berkeley.</p>

<p>Berkeley had before her marriage with Mr.
Yonkers been the most ardent of her admirers. But
a certain mystery which hung about his pecuniary
position at that time rendered him uninteresting in a
speculative point of view, whilst the hard polish and
caustic dryness of his manners and conversation repelled
the naturally passionate and romantic Amelia.</p>

<p>Berkeley, however, loved her with an insane fanaticism.
Had he received the slightest encouragement
he would have declared himself, and perhaps
have surprised and conquered Amelia by the violence
and sincerity of his passion. Apart from its
reserved air and habitual severity of expression,
Berkeley's face was handsome and striking. His
features were sharply cut, but regular and well-proportioned.
His figure was well-knit and even graceful
in its outlines. His manners were dignified and
easy. In age he was little more than Mondel's
equal. His connections were highly respectable
New Englanders. He was to all outward appearances
a most unobjectionable match for a young lady
in Miss Luton's then position.</p>

<p>By becoming suddenly Mrs. Yonkers, Amelia
almost drove Berkeley to distraction. The only
consolation he had was in reflecting that she had
perhaps escaped the horrors of a discovery of his
crimes and the consequent exposure and retribution.
Until some time after Mondel's first introduction to
Mrs. Yonkers, Berkeley neither visited nor met her.
At length, driven by fatality and a yet unconquered
love, he called upon the object of his former attentions.
He saw Mr. Yonkers, and conceived a vague
hope of yet realizing the wishes of his heart. Mrs.
Yonkers flirted with him unmercifully. By the
torments which she infected on Berkeley; she indemnified
herself for the sufferings caused by Mondel's
indifference to her own attachment.</p>

<p>As Berkeley generally called in the morning,
whilst Mondel paid his visits in the evening, they did
not at all clash or interfere with one another. But
after the meeting of Berkeley and Mondel, as described,
at the Waverley saloon, on the evening of the
scuffle, a new feature presented itself. Berkeley
called on Mondel and extracted from him not only a
confession of his views with regard to Columbia, but
a vague allusion to the difficulty of his position.
This Mondel allowed to escape him the more readily
that he had no suspicion of any serious interest being
taken by Berkeley in Mrs. Yonkers.</p>

<p>"If he has a fancy for her, a little jealousy will
make him more attentive and relieve me from a
great deal of trouble;" thought Mondel with a culpable
recklessness.</p>

<p>Berkeley, however, became savagely jealous, and
this jealousy added to the danger of his secret falling
into the hands of Mondel, through indiscretion on the
part of the sick Professor, caused the unscrupulous
fabricator of bank-bills to become the deadly enemy
of the unsuspecting poet, who neither dreamed of
his vagabond prot&eacute;ge's relation to Berkeley nor of
Berkeley's old acquaintance with and passion for
Amelia.</p>

<p>Thus, when Mrs. Yonkers confidentially assured
her suspicious admirer of her utter detestation of
Mondel, and of her wish to prevent him from
obtaining the hand of Columbia at all hazards, "for
the dear girl's sake," Berkeley was perfectly
prepared to stand by her in any emergency.</p>

<p>"Indeed I suspect," said Mrs. Yonkers, taking a
bold stride in the Avernian descent, "that he is an
odious libertine, for whilst paying his attentions to
Miss Yonkers, you will hardly believe it, he takes
every opportunity of showing me by his manner that
in fact he is&mdash;that is, that he should be only too
happy to become&mdash;well, in short, he makes love to
me as far as he dares without coming to any actual
demonstrations, whenever Columbia happens to be
out of the way!"</p>

<p>"A charming specimen of transatlantic morality,"
said the Alterer sarcastically. "He is an Englishman,
or at any rate was educated in Europe. I know him
well. He introduced me to his <i>wife</i> at Niagara."</p>

<p>"Then he is married?"</p>

<p>"Who knows?" said Berkeley, shrugging his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"And separated from his wife?"</p>

<p>"Probably."</p>

<p>"Divorced, do you think?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing more than I tell you."</p>

<p>"It is enough," thought Mrs. Yonkers, with a
diabolical sensation of triumph. "I have the mine
prepared."</p>

<p>Its explosion was not long delayed.</p>

<p>Columbia entered the room. A conversation on
general topics followed. Berkeley was, as usual,
fluent, courtly, and sarcastic.</p>

<p>"By the way, Mr. Berkeley, what a charming man
is Mr. Mondel! He is quite a favorite of mine.
What a pity that he should not live happily with his
wife! I did not even know he was married, till you
told me."</p>

<p>Berkeley saw the snare; but his hatred for Mondel,
increased by his now settled conviction of Mrs.
Yonkers' love for that detested individual, determined
him to run all risks. Berkeley was personally
brave, though usually cautious. He answered,
quietly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I did not know it myself till he introduced me to
the lady; last fall, at Niagara. She is very pretty,
and seemed quite devoted to her husband. Miss
Columbia! excuse me. You look very pale. Are
you unwell?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir," said Columbia, rising and leaving
the room, with a look at Mrs. Yonkers, which
absolutely terrified her for the consequences of her
stratagem.</p>

<p>It was a look of cold, piercing despair.  Her face
had become so pale that she resembled a ghost, as
she glided away. Mrs. Yonkers did not dare to follow
her.</p>

<p>Columbia had no suspicion of deception. She had
heard Mondel mention Berkeley casually as one of
his friends; neither was she aware that Mrs. Yonkers
had any power of control over Berkeley. She
took for granted the fact; and it was easy for Mrs.
Yonkers afterwards to fill up the details, and, by
affected expressions of pity and horror, to convince
Columbia, that the man she loved was a <i>rou&eacute;</i> of the
most unmitigated class.</p>

<p>Columbia was deeply read in books, but very innocent
in all that concerned the passions. She did
not know, what every true man knows, that your
professed saints are either the most contemptible of
hypocrites, or the most miserable specimens of humanity.</p>

<p>But how long is this infernal mystification to last?
How long are we of the harder sex to deceive and
mock the gentler half of creation, with such palpable
delusions, as the pretence that man can live in deadly
opposition to nature. To man, the indulgence of the
passion of love is an inevitable necessity. Society
has made it an inevitable crime.</p>

<p>How long will this atrocious infamy last, of selling
young beauty to old men, and driving youthful manhood
into the arms of unhappy courtesans? How long
will mothers continue to conceal from their daughters
the great truths of life, and fathers persevere in refusing
to give their sons the results of their own
dismal experience.</p>

<p>Love is the master passion of the world, the elixir
of happiness, the talisman of power. To how many
has it become a scourge and a curse! How constantly
do we see the noble and the beautiful driven apart
like ships at sea in a storm, by the errors, the prejudice,
and the cant of social imposture!</p>

<p>Thus, because Mondel had been in his past life a
<i>man</i>, and not an imbecile trifler, he was condemned
as depraved and criminal. Columbia believing him
married regarded his love as an insult. By a single
lie, malignantly repeated, was marred the happiness
of two of the most accomplished persons of their
age.</p>

<p>"Amelia," said John Berkeley abruptly, as soon as
Columbia had left the room, "this is a serious business,
did you notice the girl's face? She turned as
white as a corpse. We have, I fear, indicted a severer
blow than you intended.</p>

<p>"<i>We?</i>" exclaimed Amelia, resenting that unusual
familiarity of her companion. "<i>We?</i>  What do you
mean? Did not you tell me that Mr. Mondel <i>was</i>
married?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but you know very well that I did not
mean it seriously, and that I only said it to please
you."</p>

<p>"To please me? Why should it please me? what
does it matter to me?" said the unreasonable beauty,
pouting, and looking&mdash;in Berkeley's eyes&mdash;doubly
seductive.</p>

<p>"In that case," said Berkeley, "perhaps I had
better remedy the mistake&mdash;especially as in making
it, I deliberately risked my life."</p>

<p>"How risked your life?" said Mrs. Yonkers, with
some show of interest.</p>

<p>"Do you think Mondel is the man to leave so
gross an injury unrevenged? No madam, if he discover
the deception he will either kill me or I shall
kill him; rely upon that as certain."</p>

<p>"But he never can discover it."</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen. Sooner or later many
things are discovered;" muttered Berkeley gloomily.
"However, the thing is done, let us leave the rest to
fate. As for you, Amelia, you see that when you ask
even a crime as a proof of my devotion, I cannot
refuse you!"</p>

<p>"O, Mr. Berkeley!"</p>

<p>"One kiss before we part."</p>

<p>"Leave me, sir, I insist."</p>

<p>"My dear girl, consider how long, how ardently I
have loved you."</p>

<p>"There!&mdash;now go, I hear Mr. Yonkers opening the
door with his latch-key. Go"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"To-morrow?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>"Good by, dearest!"</p>

<p>"Good by."</p>

<p>And Berkeley departed in a state of delicious
vertigo. The knell of Mondel's happiness was the
signal for his own to commence. He had gained that
first step which counts for so much. Experience told
him that the rest must inevitably follow. But bold
as he was, under all ordinary circumstances, he could
not, on calmer reaction, recall without a rather
unpleasant sensation, the fact that he had done a
deadly injury to a man who under adequate provocation
was capable of going to the most desperate
extremities.</p>

<p>Henceforward, not only his liberty but his life
hung by a thread, and the terrible arm of the law
was not more certainly suspended over his head than
was the deadly pistol of Mondel hypothetically pointed
at his heart. By his head he had sinned against mankind,
by his heart he had wronged Mondel. By a
single phrase he had doubled the perils of his destiny.
And the Professor&mdash;what if the Professor should
betray him? Truly, John Berkeley's was not an
enviable predicament.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p id="c14">CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p>THE SICK MAN.</p>

</div>

<p>SLOWLY and painfully the wounded vagabond
recovered from the effects of Cope's well directed
blow. Berkeley called daily to inquire as to his progress.
Dr. Vortex attended him with the greatest
assiduity, and as his attentions were gratuitous, he
deserved more credit for the regularity of his visits.
Cope and Mondel nursed the patient, assisted by the
latter's landlady, Mrs. Normer. Mrs. Normer was a
stout, fine looking, dark-eyed widow, a German by
birth, whose father had been a colonel in the Prussian
army. She was one of those true, noble, generous
natures which are so rarely met with, and which seem
created for the express purpose of consoling the suffering
and aiding the unfortunate. Married young,
unfortunate in her marriage, and disappointed in her
affections, she yet had faced adversity with a lofty
and steady courage, and maintained herself and her
little daughter in respectability and comfort. All
who knew her esteemed and admired her. Every
one who lodged in her house became her personal
friend. She had lived long in the South, and in her
youth&mdash;she married, at sixteen, a dissipated Virginian&mdash;had
imbibed prejudices which rendered her utterly
impervious to all argument against the great institution
of negro slavery. In her eyes there was nothing
meaner under the sun than an abolitionist. She could
not realize the idea that people of color were to be
put upon an equality with whites. Nevertheless, no
"darkey" in distress could have applied with a better
chance of assistance than to Madame Normer&mdash;or, as
her boarders habitually addressed her, "Madame."
Her house was generally occupied by gentlemen only;
chiefly officers in the army, Southerners, <i>literati</i>, or
foreigners of distinction. Mrs. Normer possessed, in
addition to great experience and the keenest observation,
a profound intuition of character. She had
brought from the Old World, and kept up in her
Southern life, a strong aristocratic predilection in
favor of good birth, manners and education, notwithstanding
that she was, in many respects, most democratic<i>ally</i>
democratic. In her bearing she was free
in her language, often reckless of conventional forms.
But the delicacy of her feelings at heart rendered her
incapable of wounding the sensibility of a fellow
creature. She was fond of animals, and had a splendid
greyhound, a parrot, and divers cages of canaries,
all which she tended with the greatest care and kindness.
Between Mondel and Mrs. Normer subsisted a
friendship founded on mutual esteem and respect. In
all worldly matters she was Mondel's <i>confidante</i>, and
Mondel hers. They understood one another perfectly,
for neither was capable of meanness. In conclusion,
Mrs. Normer gave the poet unlimited credit, knowing
well that he always took the earliest opportunity of
paying up arrears. This the irregularity of his
receipts almost necessitated. Having premised thus
much, the reader will understand that nothing which
Mondel might take it into his head to do was likely to
meet with opposition on the part of Mrs. Normer.
Thus, when Mondel brought home the wounded Professor
to his apartments, he simply communicated the fact
to his benevolent landlady, and she at once dismissed
all thought upon the subject, until the sick
man should be restored to a state of convalescence.
The desire to save a man's life was, in her eyes, quite
enough to explain Mondel's conduct, and the unlucky
burglar found himself in most desirable quarters.</p>

<p>When, after a long interval of fever and mental
confusion, the Professor awoke to a clear consciousness
of his position, he beheld a grave, benevolent
face gazing calmly upon him from the foot of the bed,
to which gradually added itself, as his perceptions
became clearer, the whole form of Dudley Mondel,
with a dim vision of a lady slicing up a water-melon
at a small table, in the background. This lady was
Mrs. Normer.</p>

<p>The water-melon was a huge specimen, as big as
the giant Garagantua's head, or the famous roc's egg,
mentioned by Sinbad, the sailor. The Professor's
eyes brightened as he perceived coming towards him
the no longer visionary lady, with a large plate of
melon, free from rind or seeds, and ready for immediate
consumption. The poor vagabond, who had
eaten scarcely anything since his illness, attacked the
succulent vegetable instinctively, and felt wonderfully
revived.</p>

<p>"Thank you, ma'am&mdash;thank you, sir," he murmured,
faintly. So weak was the once Herculean
man, that a child might have beaten him without
fear of resistance. Nevertheless, he felt a strange
sensation of well-being. The cleanliness and comfort
of everything around him, a certain elegance in the
arrangement of the furniture, above all, the gentle
expression of the faces of Mondel and Mrs. Normer,
all showed him that he had been transplanted into
the atmosphere of a world entirely different from
that in which he had of late been accustomed to
dwell.</p>

<p>Dim recollections&mdash;dim as to distance, yet vivid as
to imagery&mdash;of his early childhood, of his father's
house, of his old school-room, before he ran away
and went to sea, as he did at the age of thirteen, and
became, by one accident and another, from reckless
audacity and wild companionship, first a smuggler,
then a robber. All passed swiftly before his mind.
Even his little playmate, Alice, came dancing, with
her blue sash and her yellow hoop, and golden hair,
before his retrospective imagination. Old, long-forgotten
impulses&mdash;long-crushed boyish sentiments, which
never yet had found their expansion, upheaved within
his soul, and beams of sincere, deep-felt gratitude
shone in his dark greenish eyes, as they rested, admiringly,
on the noble countenance of Mondel.</p>

<p>That countenance, with its lofty air of command,
and broad, white, massive brow, its soft, unwavering
eyes, and regular features, its brown silky hair; and
fair, pale, spiritual complexion&mdash;that countenance
swam before the eyes of the sick outcast, like the
phantasm of some divine messenger from another
world, calling him back to virtue and humanity.</p>

<p>In truth, Columbia's love had illuminated Mondel's
features with a serene radiance of happy confidence
and hope, that made him quite another being
in appearance, from the stern and haughty personage
with whom the world at large was more familiar.</p>

<p>Nor did the tall stature and athletic proportions of
his benefactor, by any means, diminish the Professor's
feelings of admiration. For the first time in his life
the pugilistic bandit felt a real sentiment of respect
and awe, very different from the indefinite feelings
with which John Berkeley, the Alterer, had inspired
him.</p>

<p>By a sudden inexplicable movement of his soul,
the Professor resolved to devote his future life, if
spared, to the service of Mondel, who, seating
himself by the bedside, kindly took the right hand of
the invalid in his own. The Professor squeezed it
feebly. By that squeeze he meant to imply&mdash;"Yours,
till death. I am your slave; you are my master."</p>

<p>"How do you feel, my friend?" said Mondel.</p>

<p>"Better," said the Professor&mdash;"better, sir&mdash;oh!
much better!"</p>

<p>He spoke, in fact, more of the state of his soul than
of his body.</p>

<p>"Does it fatigue you to speak?"</p>

<p>"No sir."</p>

<p>"Then let me ask, since you have been so long insensible
to outward events, whether you have any
family or friends with whom you wish to communicate?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried the wounded man, with a sharp cry,
starting up, but only incipiently, for he was too weak
actually to raise his head from the pillow&mdash;"ah!  I
had forgotten them&mdash;the children&mdash;the poor children!"</p>

<p>"What! You have children?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. They are not mine. They are the
children of a friend&mdash;a brave fellow, as ever fought
under the black &mdash;&mdash;. I mean, sir, he was shot at
my side, in a sea-fight, and his last words were&mdash;'Dick,
take care of the children.' So I did."</p>

<p>"And where are they now?"</p>

<p>"With Sally."</p>

<p>"Who is Sally?"</p>

<p>"A woman I lived with&mdash;not that I really cared
for her, but she never would leave me, because she
did not know what else to do, I suppose," and the
Professor heaved an ominous sigh at the recollection
of the very limited felicity of this unsanctioned marriage
of his.</p>

<p>"Has she the means to support them? You are
not perhaps aware that you have been more than a
month confined to this room?"</p>

<p>"More than a month!" exclaimed the Professor,
"ah, yes, I have had lots of dreams too, it seems
only the other day or else an age. I don't know&mdash;my
head is weak."</p>

<p>"Where do the children live?"</p>

<p>"Sally Smith&mdash;ask for Sally Smith corner of
Grand and Putnam."</p>

<p>"Good," said Mondel, "now do not try to talk any
more, I will go and see about the children at once."</p>

<p>"God bless you, sir!" said the vagabond, himself
much astonished to hear such a phrase escape his
lips, and the exhausted Professor lapsed once more
into the oblivion of slumber.</p>

<p>Mondel went straight to the address indicated;
but Sally Smith and the children had left their
lodging weeks before, and as their rent had remained
by some accident unsettled, Miss Smith had not
deemed it necessary to leave her next address behind
her. After many vain inquiries Mondel returned
with the conviction that until the Professor was
himself able to head the search, all chance of finding
them would be hopeless. There are so many vagabond
children and such an immense number of Miss
Smiths in New York!</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p id="c15">CHAPTER XV.</p>

<p>CHAOS.</p>

</div>

<p>"THERE are two letters for you, Mr. Mondel," said
Mrs. Normer, as Dudley returned from his unsuccessful
expedition in search of the children of the
deceased pirate, and the young lady whose "name
was Legion."</p>

<p>Dudley took the letters, and an electric current
ran up his arm, as he recognized in the direction of
the smaller envelope of the two, the handwriting of
Columbia.</p>

<p>The moment he was alone in his study, he broke
the seal of the note, carelessly throwing the other
letter on the table.</p>

<p>As he read, his eyes grew fixed and glazed, his
hands trembled, his face lost even the faintest trace
of color.</p>

<p>He read it again, and a third time, and still
remained motionless and white as a marble statue of
Horror.</p>

<p>The letter contained these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Columbia Yonkers presents her compliments to Mr. Mondel,
and begs him to understand that this note must positively terminate
their acquaintance."</p>

<p>For several hours Mondel remained plunged in a
state of gloomy abstraction. He reviewed the past,
interview by interview. He recalled every particular
of Columbia's manner, her shyness and reserve, her
fits of dreamy silence, and manifold eccentricities.</p>

<p>"She never loved me!" he at length muttered,
"possibly she tried to do so&mdash;and failed, my conversation
perhaps interested her, but my personality was
indifferent. Yet she told me to hope! But no, that
was a momentary impulse, the result of my comedy's
triumph, or, perhaps&mdash;perhaps her words bore another
meaning&mdash;she seems to live but in the ideal world of
intellect and poetry&mdash;perhaps she meant that I might
hope as a poet and a dramatist? Yet, I have fancied,
that in her looks I read&mdash;but how could I read her
looks&mdash;I, stained with all the sensualism and selfishness
of the world, she, so pure, so spiritual? The
dream is at an end!&mdash;at our last meeting, I perceived
a strange coldness in her manner&mdash;her eyes avoided
mine&mdash;I thought she withdrew her hand hastily at
parting. Well, well, such happiness was too glorious
to be real. There is no necessity for my living and
suffering in this mean, dastardly world of hypocrites
and traders! I can die&mdash;die as I have lived, a free
man, the lord of my own destiny;" and Mondel
having laid his pistols upon the table, paced slowly
up and down the apartment with an air of utterly
desperate depression.</p>

<p>The reader will, perhaps, be amazed, that a man
like Mondel, should accept Columbia's note as final,
without even suspecting a secret cause for her
conduct, or endeavoring to effect a change in her
resolution.</p>

<p>But true love is a beautiful insanity. Mondel's
love demanded absolute reciprocity or nothing.  In
the excess of his pride, and the violence of his passion,
he was unreasonable and extravagant. Thus, at
the first shock given by Columbia's insulting note,
his mind naturally fixed upon the worst and most
hopeless view of the case. He did not, in his first
moments of agony, contemplate an external agency,
because all his fears naturally pointed towards an
internal and purely passional cause.</p>

<p>"Love," argued the poet-philosopher, "can never
be forced. Love is a wild flower, not a garden plant.
If Columbia at any time loved me, no outward circumstances
could destroy that love, and therefore she
must love me still. If she never loved me&mdash;as I cannot
but believe&mdash;no perseverance on my part would have
surmounted a radical discord of nature. There is no
such thing as winning a woman. There is no medium
between love and indifference; and to try to reason
indifference into admiration, or tempt it into desire,
is the labor of a fool. Either love is a pre-existent
harmony between two spiritual types, of which the
bodily organizations are the absolute representatives,
or it is nothing. If love be a pre-existent harmony,
then is love at first sight the only real love I can
acknowledge! Alas! into what an error did my
wild longing for ideal bliss lead me, when in the first
eager glances of Columbia's curiosity at the sight of
a stranger and a supposed man of genius, I read that
answer to my own mad prayers to Destiny, which
must now for ever remain without response from
humanity! Fool, fool, vain fool that I was!" And
in an  agony of self-abasement, the strong man threw
himself upon a sofa, and wept long and bitterly over
the last withered blossom of his wild and passionate
youth.</p>

<p>At length he arose. His pale face seemed to have
grown thinner, his eyes deeper and darker, his whole
aspect more sombre and ghost-like.</p>

<p>"What if I turn monk?" said he, and a slight shudder
pervaded his whole frame, as he whispered the
awful words.</p>

<p>Awful indeed was the meaning which Mondel
attached to those words. To him they meant, what
if I become a living corpse, a disembodied spirit, a
spectre of my former self? What if I abrogate for
ever the hopes and passions of life? What if I die in
the flesh, and, abjuring manhood, walk the earth an
abstraction, a type, a phantom? Then, in a spirit of
horrible mockery, Mondel abjured the religion of his
life, the worship of Venus, the adoration of beauty,
and the search for the incarnation of the ideal woman
for ever! He registered his vow, and became a monk
of the order of desolation&mdash;the order being as yet
comprised in himself. A strange, dreamy listlessness
stole over him. If I might venture on a much
abused class of illustration, I would say that from
being surcharged with positive vitality, he had become
a perfect battery of the negative fluid. In this state
he sat down and wrote the following reply to Columbia's
note:</p>

<p>"Farewell for ever. Yours, and yours alone,<br/>

"Mondel"</p>

<p>Then he continued to pace the room with the same
dreamy spectral manner, supremely indifferent to all
things earthly or unearthly, till the shades of night
descended, and he still paced up and down in the
gathering darkness.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p id="c16">CHAPTER XVI.</p>

<p>THE JUDAS-KISS.</p>

</div>

<p>"A LADY wishes to see you, sir," said the servant.</p>

<p>"Show her in," said Mondel, with a sudden bound
of the heart, that strangely belied his newly adopted
monkdom. A wild hope rushed through his brain.</p>

<p>Entered&mdash;Mrs. Yonkers. With instantaneous reaction,
Mondel was the same spectral statue of despair,
which we have seen automatically pacing his study in
the darkness. Mechanically he lit a lamp.</p>

<p>"Be seated, madam," he said, and waited for her
to speak.</p>

<p>"My presence here, at this hour, no doubt surprises
you," Mrs. Yonkers began.</p>

<p>"Nothing surprises me," said Mondel, gloomily.</p>

<p>His voice had a curious, monotonous cadence,
which struck Mrs. Yonkers as peculiar.</p>

<p>"I have called upon you because&mdash;because I wish
your happiness," she resumed.</p>

<p>"Thank you, madam," said Mondel. The four
syllables were like four hail-stones falling, one after
another, on a flat stone.</p>

<p>"You were interested in Miss Columbia Yonkers."</p>

<p>"Well, madam?" said Mondel, his eyes alone
assuming a yet more disdainful expression.</p>

<p>"You loved her, adored her, were devoted to her?"
said Mrs. Yonkers, with a pleasant quietude, yet
with a secret fury.</p>

<p>"Well, madam?" said Mondel, sternly.</p>

<p>"She has written you a most insulting note?" continued
Mrs. Yonkers, looking down to avoid Mondel's
penetrating gaze.</p>

<p>"No madam."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know she has; and believe me, Mr. Mondel,"&mdash;here
Amelia seemed much affected,&mdash;"believe
me, I cannot bear that you should labor under a
delusion which may influence the happiness of your
life."</p>

<p>"Well, madam?"</p>

<p>"You think Columbia once loved you?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, madam?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you think so; I thought so too. Mr.
Mondel, I felt an interest in you. I admired&mdash;nay,
why should I disguise the truth&mdash;I loved you too well
not to wish you happy."</p>

<p>Mondel was still silent and unmoved. He allowed
the image of Mrs. Yonkers to float before his eyes,
her voice to strike upon the tympana of his ears:
that was all.</p>

<p>"My dear friend, you were a victim to a delusion,
as was I myself."</p>

<p>Mondel gave no sign.</p>

<p>"She never loved you. I do not think she ever
loved anybody."</p>

<p>"Never!" said Mondel, still coldly, but assuredly
less icily than before&mdash;"never?"</p>

<p>"<i>Never</i>," replied Mrs. Yonkers, not perceiving
that cold as was the tone of this query, it was the
first sign of interest which, as yet, she had succeeded
in eliciting. "When I spoke to her of marrying
you, she expressed the most violent repugnance;
indeed, she expressed her detestation of marriage,
and of love in any form."</p>

<p>"Strange," said Mondel.</p>

<p>"Very," said Mrs. Yonkers. "Had you treated
her as a friend only, you might have still been
received by her. But the moment you assumed the
character of a lover, you became a source of painful
aversion."</p>

<p>Mondel bowed, with the same unchanged face and
listless manner.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mondel, I am sorry for you. I can understand
your feelings. It almost broke my heart to
see you lavishing your love upon a cold, ungrateful
girl, when &mdash;&mdash;. Oh, Mr. Mondel! Such a soul as
yours was never made for solitude. Let us be
friends." The unhappy Amelia here took Mondel's
hand in her own. It was like the hand of a corpse.
"Let us be&mdash;as we were before you saw this proud
selfish, unsympathizing woman."</p>

<p>"Do not speak of her," said Mondel.</p>

<p>"No. We will not speak of her," said, Amelia,
gazing up, imploringly, at the dreamy eyes of the
self-made monk. "Let us speak of other things."</p>

<p>Mondel was silent.</p>

<p>"Is there anything that I can do to make you
happy?" said Mrs. Yonkers, softly.</p>

<p>"Yes. Go home," was Mondel's uncompromising
answer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yonkers started with an offended air at this
outrageous excess of disdainful indifference, on the
part of a man to whom she was, harsh as the term
may sound, engaged in making love, and that in the
most desperate manner.</p>

<p>"I mean," said, Mondel, "that your reputation
may suffer. I fear"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> fear nothing, with you," replied, Mrs. Yonkers.</p>

<p>Mondel frowned darkly. He rose, took his hat,
and said to Amelia, in a tone of cruel coldness&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, madam, allow me the honor of escorting
you home."</p>

<p>Mrs. Yonkers shivered with anger and disappointment.
She took Mondel's arm, which he did not
offer. She felt the necessity of a yet surer revenge.
A woman whose love is despised and rejected, becomes
a tigress.</p>

<p>In the extremity of his despair, Mondel became
satanic. The fate of such a woman as Mrs. Yonkers
was to him of no possible interest. What she called
love, he did not deign to recognize. He no longer
feared her. He only wished to be rid of her annoyance.
In dead silence, he accompanied her to her
house.</p>

<p>Columbia was standing at an open window.</p>

<p>Amelia saw her, though Mondel did not. Mrs.
Yonkers knew the habits of her step-daughter. A
gas-lamp fell full upon herself and Mondel. She
paused, suddenly, and throwing her arms round
Mondel's neck, kissed him passionately. Then leaving
him, utterly confounded and amazed by her conduct,
ran up the steps which led to the door, and
rang the bell violently.</p>

<p>Mondel strode away in a tempest of rage.</p>

<p>"Infernal woman!" he exclaimed&mdash;"a thousand
curses on her absurd passion! What if Columbia
had seen us? But that is not likely. The darkness
of the night, the hour, the suddenness of the act. No.
It is not likely that we were seen. But the woman
is mad! And, after all, what matters <i>now?</i>"</p>

<p>Mondel forgot, for an instant, that he was a monk&mdash;that
he had eternally resigned all hope of Columbia's
love. For many hours he paced the streets
that night, and many and strange were the wild
speculations he indulged in.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Yonkers entered the room from
which Columbia had witnessed her parting
with Mondel. Her first words were&mdash;</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, do not betray me to your
father. I am innocent&mdash;I am, indeed. I have just
parted with Mr. Mondel for ever. I saw you at the
window, Columbia, but I call God to witness that
you beheld the first and last kiss ever exchanged
between us. Now you know all&mdash;you know the
secret of his attentions to yourself, of all his mysterious
conduct. Pity me! I am indeed, guilty&mdash;if to
love be guilt alone. But, indeed, indeed, Columbia,
I am not criminal, towards Mr. Yonkers!"</p>

<p>And Amelia burst into tears&mdash;real tears of fury,
disappointment, and baffled passion.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> shall not betray you, madam," said Columbia
loftily, as she swept from the room with the dignity
of an imperial queen.</p>

<p>"And so," she said when she reached her own
room, "the world is vile enough for such revolting
crimes. He loved my step-mother after all, and yet
he dared&mdash;the wretch, the insolent, the mean-souled
traitor!"</p>

<p>And Columbia paced the room, her hair flying in
wild disorder, her eyes flashing, her virgin bosom
heaving wildly, like the surge of ocean, a very picture
of divine Nemesis.</p>

<p>"Dudley Mondel, I despise you," she fiercely wrote
with trembling angers, on the fly leaf of her lover's
great philosophical work.</p>

<p>Then the poor betrayed, unhappy girl, pressed her
hands to her throbbing temples, and exclaimed
bitterly, "O God, O God! what is all the genius and
wealth of this world when love is for ever absent!"</p>

<p>And as she vainly tried to sob herself to sleep, the
blonde poetess murmured distractedly: "And yet I
love him still&mdash;I love him still!"<p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p id="c17">CHAPTER XVII.</p>

<p>LIFE AND DEATH.</p>

</div>

<p>WHEN Mondel returned home, long after midnight,
he saw the second yet unopened letter on his table.
Without feeling the slightest interest in its contents,
he opened, it and read:</p>

<p>"DEAR SIR:&mdash;You can have the ship, and the funds are
ready.<br/>

"ROBERT LAX.<br/>

"P.S.&mdash;Call to-morrow at ten."</p>

<p>Mondel read this laconic note with imperturbable
indifference. What but the day before would have
elated him beyond measure, was now a matter of no
import.</p>

<p>Robert Lax was a man of immense capital, a great
part of which was invested in ocean steamboats. The
ship and funds he spoke of were destined to the carrying
out of a new motive power discovered by Mondel,
in whose eyes the offer amounted to a certain
fortune. But what is the ambition of the inventor or
the desire for fortune, compared to the all-absorbing
interest of a great passion. Columbia lost, all Mondel's
daring schemes became, in his eyes, stale, flat
and unprofitable. An intellectual languor had seized
on his soul, accompanied by a bodily restlessness.
What cared he for progress or science, for fame or
fortune? His life, within a few hours, had become a
purgatory. The long weariness of a life of adventure
and contest returned upon him with full force, and he
asked himself, as in many a dark hour he had asked
before, "Why live to suffer? Why suffer to
live?"</p>

<p>With a moody air he once more laid his pistols
upon the table&mdash;two long duelling pistols which he had
reserved for some such desperate emergency. They
were already loaded.</p>

<p>"An instant's resolution," thought he, "and all
my pains are at an end, and this strange, sensitive, unhappy
organization, which men call Dudley Mondel, is a
thing of the past, a theme for newspaper paragraphs,
a study for the dissecting room on the one hand, and
the post mortem critics on the other."</p>

<p>Mondel paced slowly up and down, eyeing the pistols
as he passed with a certain gloomy satisfaction.
There is an absolute certainty about death that is fascinating
to the philosophic mind.</p>

<p>It involves no worldly after-thought. Its results
being utterly unknown, must be left to take care of
themselves. It is a solution of all difficulties&mdash;it is a
complete measure, and cannot be improved on. To
die is to die, and dead men need to answer no
questions.</p>

<p>Still two thoughts occupy the minds of most intending
suicides. One is the vain idea of what people
will think and say of them afterwards. The other,
what will become of themselves in that new world
which lies behind the black curtain of shadows which,
by men, is called Death.</p>

<p>Mondel took out of a drawer a small pile of manuscript.</p>

<p>"Here," thought he, "are my memoirs. What
a pity that I have left off precisely at the most interesting
point! Suppose I add a few pages, and send
them to Columbia."</p>

<p>This led to a long, dreamy reverie on the beauty,
the grace, the ineffable charms of his lost idol.</p>

<p>Finally, though he would have repudiated the
suspicion, had any mocking demon whispered it in
his ear, a vague shadowy sense of <i>hope</i> began to arise
in his soul, and struggle quietly but vigorously for
ascendancy with the still dominating thought of self-destruction.</p>

<p>What if Columbia loved him after all? What if
she did not yet understand him? Or had misunderstood
something he had said? What if Mrs. Yonkers'
jealousy had caused her to utter reports to his prejudice?
What if he were to write to Columbia and
demand&mdash;no, entreat&mdash;an explanation?</p>

<p>But no, these were idle fancies. There was her
letter distinctly repudiating his acquaintance, casting
him off with scorn and indifference. No woman
who had ever felt a spark of love warm her heart
would write so cold and insulting an edict. His
pride rebelled, too, against the thought of bending
perhaps only to the lash of contempt. He threw
down the pen which he had taken up and approached
the table on which the pistols were lying.</p>

<p>"I have never truly enjoyed life," said Mondel to
himself; "the satisfaction of my highest cravings has
ever escaped me. Who shall say that the discovery
of the nullity of earthly life and its pleasures is not
in itself a step to a superior intellectual state? And
yet, O Columbia, adored Columbia! what a paradise
might earth have been to me if thou"&mdash;Mondel did
not complete the sentence in his mind, which dissolved
in a vast agonizing attempt to grasp the idea
of the immensity of the happiness which he had lost.
In this overwhelming thought all minor considerations
disappeared; all ideas of writing letters or
leaving a written explanation of his conduct, a profession
of faith or a formal farewell to his friends, was
banished as trivial fancies unworthy of a man
earnestly bent upon embarking for an unknown
world. With a steady hand Mondel pointed one
of the pistols at his heart. Strange fancy! he had
the vanity to wish to leave his face intact, in case&mdash;absurd
supposition!&mdash;that Columbia should take it
into her head to wish to see his corpse. The pistol
was cocked, his finger was on the hair trigger,
another instant and Dudley Mondel would have
executed his design,&mdash;&mdash;suddenly a deep groan was
heard in the Professor's room.</p>

<p>Mondel instinctively deferred his suicidal project
in order to fulfil a last duty to humanity. He
found the patient in great pain, and was long
occupied in attending to him.</p>

<p>"How kind you are!" said the Professor&mdash;"and
yet, if you knew what I have been!"</p>

<p>"What have you been&mdash;a murderer?" said Mondel
quietly.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no, not so bad as that; I never killed a
man except in fair fight, and I don't call <i>that</i>
murder," said the vagabond argumentatively.</p>

<p>"A pirate&mdash;a robber&mdash;a forger?" said Mondel.</p>

<p>"In that line," said the Professor dismally.</p>

<p>"It is of no consequence," said Mondel cynically;
"all men rob, lie and commit acts of brute-force,
violence, moral or physical. It is a mere question
of <i>form</i>."</p>

<p>"But I wish to&mdash;well, to turn over a new leaf
when I get well," said the bandit.</p>

<p>"Hardly worth while," murmured the poet.</p>

<p>"I thought it would please you," said the Professor
disappointedly; "I wanted to show you my
gratitude by devoting myself to your service."</p>

<p>"No one can serve me," said Mondel; "you will
never see me again in this world."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, sir?"</p>

<p>"I simply mean that I am going to shoot myself;
so don't be alarmed if you hear the report of a pistol
presently;"</p>

<p>"Shoot yourself?" said the Professor, "what for?"</p>

<p>"Because I am too unhappy to live&mdash;the only
reason, I imagine, for which men ever do shoot themselves."</p>

<p>"You, too unhappy to live? then what am I?"
said the hard-headed vagabond, who had a blunt sort
of logic of his own, which Cope's blow had luckily
not deranged. "What am I?"</p>

<p>The tremendous contrast thus suggested, caused
Mondel to indulge in a few curious reflections. Men
on the verge of suicide, are very apt to reflect
curiously.</p>

<p>"Are you hard up?" said the Professor, "people
mostly commit suicide for want of money. But hold
on till I'm well, and I'll raise the wind for you. No
matter how; that is my affair. Men must live. At
any rate, I'll take all the risk."</p>

<p>"Then, you would rob for me, my friend?" said
Mondel, with a slight rising in the throat; betokening
a return to human emotions, which he would
fain have repudiated.</p>

<p>"Why not? one good turn deserves another."</p>

<p>"I see you have some sense of social duties and
relations," said Mondel, smiling grimly. "Nevertheless,
I must leave you. Good night."</p>

<p>"But, sir!" cried the Professor, at his wits' end,
"what will become of <i>me</i> if you shoot yourself?"</p>

<p>"True," thought Mondel, "and poor Mrs. Normer!
Her position will be very unpleasant; besides,
I owe her fifty dollars. Pshaw, what are the paltry
obligations of society to a soul about to take a plunge
into eternity?"</p>

<p>"Sir, sir," cried the Professor, "consider, I shall
be accused of the murder!"</p>

<p>"I will leave a writing to explain," said Mondel.</p>

<p>The Professor relapsed into exhaustion.</p>

<p>Mondel returned to his room, and once more raised
his pistol. He pulled the trigger&mdash;the hammer
descended on the cap&mdash;the cap ignited, and no explosion
followed! Without an instant's hesitation,
Mondel adjusted the second pistol, and immediately
fired&mdash;with the same result.</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" exclaimed the would-be suicide.</p>

<p>"Not at all; I drew the charges," said a well-known
voice.</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened, and Peregrine
Cope stood on the threshold.</p>

<p>"Why, how on earth did you enter at this hour?"</p>

<p>"By a very simple magic&mdash;by a latch-key which
fits your door. I had a presentiment that something
was wrong with you."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"You broke your appointment with me, and as
you and I have agreed long ago that only snobs break
appointments, I knew there was cause for it. I have
been at a party till now, and coming home, I felt an
unaccountable curiosity to learn what had happened
to you."</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said Mondel, "I really forgot you;
as to what has happened, I have been simply sentenced,
and the execution would have taken place,
but for your well-meant interference, for which I
regret not to be able to thank you."</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it?" said Cope.</p>

<p>Mondel told his tale. It is in such cases an inexpressible
relief to confide in the sympathy of a real
friend.</p>

<p>Peregrine Cope said all that ingenuity could suggest
to revive the hopes of his friend. "All I ask is
time," said this sage counsellor, after a long conversation.
"Let me make the lady's acquaintance, and
find out the secret cause of her conduct&mdash;meanwhile,
be sure and see Robert Lax to-morrow. Let us die
fighting at any rate. You cannot marry without
means, and literature is the devil. Fix the capitalist,
and leave me to watch the lady. Good night!"</p>

<p>And Cope departed as noiselessly as he had entered,
after extorting a promise from Mondel, to defer all
extreme measures till they had again conversed on
the subject.</p>

<p>Mondel, who had eaten nothing all day, but a slice
of toast at breakfast, fell, dressed as he was, upon the
sofa-bed which he occupied since the Professor had
become his guest, and soon fell into an uneasy slumber,
full of those strange, vivid, fantastic dreams,
which come only in their perfection, under circumstances
of intense cerebral excitement.</p>

<p>In all these dreams Columbia figured as the leading
actress, and wonderful was the variety of parts
in which she ever fascinated her audience with equal
dexterity. A grand theatre is dream-land, and one
in which some splendid dramas are represented! The
best of it is, that a private box costs nothing, and
that all the actors are well up in their parts, whilst
the scenery is always effective, and the  <i>r&eacute;pertoire</i>
absolutely inexhaustible. Although Mondel shot
himself over and over again, during this night of
restless fantasies, he was rather surprised to find himself
in perfectly good preservation at ten o' clock on
the following morning, expounding to Robert Lax the
necessities and requirements of his new engines. As
for the Professor, he was easily persuaded that Mondel's
eccentric conversation on the previous night
was a mere joke of the latter.</p>

<p>We may as well state here that before Mondel's
ship and its new engines were ready for trial, the
Professor had perfectly recovered his health, and
proved a most valuable aid to Mondel in the minor
arrangements of his vessel. But the retreat of the
pirate's children he utterly failed in discovering.
And Sally Smith had relapsed into the universal gulf
of Smithdom, and no more to be found. Probably
she had left the city, and taken the children with
her.</p>

<p>Intense occupation, no doubt, deadened the sense
of his loss to our adventurous lover, yet could the
image of Columbia never be said to be absent from
his mind.</p>

<p>Peregrine Cope, though he amused his friend
with news of Columbia's looks and sayings, was constrained
to report, that at the mention of his (Mondel's)
name, she immediately discontinued or changed
the conversation.</p>

<p>Several times the two unfortunate lovers passed
one another in the street, but Mondel's bow was met
by an averted look, and no accident occurred to provoke
or justify a closer interview.</p>

<p>It seemed as if these two noble spirits were separated
by a vast wall of crystal, impassable, yet transparent.
Of this wall Amelia Yonkers was the triumphant
architect&mdash;she and her guilty admirer and
accomplice, John Berkeley the counterfeiter.</p>

<p id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII.</p>

<p>THE GAMBLERS.</p>

</div>

<p>IT was still early in the forenoon, on a fine dry
dusty summer's day, that a plainly but fashionably-attired
gentleman entered an open doorway in a
house not far from the Park, ascended a staircase,
passed through an ante-room, past a negro, who
vaguely protested against the liberty, and, without
making a sign, or uttering a word, walked into a
large room devoted to the blind goddess Fortune.</p>

<p>In the centre of the room stood a faro-table, with
its thirteen cards systematically arranged. Thirteen
is considered an unlucky number, and when the
Devil first invented cards no doubt he had that
superstition in view. And faro is an unlucky game
for those who play against the bank; especially for
confiding individuals.</p>

<p>In this great country talent makes itself felt, and
a "smart" man soon rises from the humblest obscurity
to positions of comparative magnificence.</p>

<p>We beg the reader, therefore, not to be too much
amazed at recognizing in the well-dressed, well-oiled
and well-washed gentleman who officiated as banker
and dealer, our quondam vagabond, Mr. Robert
Mombcross, or Confidence Bob, whom not long ago
we saw succumb so ingloriously to the valor of the
illustrious O'Bouncer, maternally descended, as we
know, from the imperial house of Fitzgammon.</p>

<p>By his side, and occupied with the cash box and
counters, sat the sharp-eyed Slinker. Around the
table were divers gentlemen of the great gambling
fraternity, with the queerest physiognomies, and the
quietest and easiest manners.</p>

<p>At first sight, the gambler and the trading speculator
resemble one another. But the vulture-like
greed, and cold pitiless selfishness which causes so
many faces in Wall street to resemble birds of prey,
or venomous reptiles, is rarely seen amongst gamblers.
The gambler has travelled, has seen ups and
downs in life, has experienced the necessity of friendship.
He is at open war with society&mdash;he cheats in a
manner professedly. He does not try to humbug
you into the idea that he is an honest man.</p>

<p>Gamblers may, as a general rule, be divided into
two great classes&mdash;insiders or swindlers, outsiders or
dupes. The first swindler&mdash;I here consider cheating
as a fine art&mdash;is he, who wearing a quiet frank air,
says little or nothing, and, above all, avoids looking
as if he knew more than another. The most egregious
dupe is he who has the will, but lacks the ingenuity
to cheat. Such men are always terribly cunning, and
much given to assert the utter fallacy of an attempt
to take them in. Of course no really accomplished
gambler ever even contemplates, much less talks of,
such a casualty; He may be robbed or victimized
as a friend, but cheated?&mdash;impossible!</p>

<p>The British nobility and gentry have brought the
gambling swindle perhaps to higher perfection than
any other class or nation, in the development of their
exquisitely rascally <i>turf system</i>.</p>

<p>The French Bourse, or Stock Exchange, is, however,
by some considered admirable, and the King
or Emperor there, as the case may be, and their
ministers, aided by Rothschild and the bankocrats,
find dishonesty the best policy to an extent almost
incredible to the uninitiated.</p>

<p>America&mdash;putting the Presidential elections aside&mdash;America
excels mainly in downright gambling
proper. Although Germany still maintains public
and authorized tables, it is only in America that
gamblers can be said to form a distinct and important
class of the community.</p>

<p>This dangerous <i>non-producing</i> class swarms on
the Mississippi River, in New Orleans, New York, and
all great cities. It is a heavy additional tax on the
working part of the community. The gambling
resembles the banking-system or swindle; it is the
cunning of the few playing, with every chance in its
favor, against the ignorance of the many.</p>

<p>The pertinacity of ignorance is wonderful!</p>

<p>Expose all the tricks of gamblers, and the utter
stupidity of frequenting gambling-houses to-day, and
no diminution of their custom would be perceived by
the "bankers" to-morrow.</p>

<p>Explain that unproductive capital bearing interest
is a ridiculous fallacy, a gross imposture or practical
joke; in short, that banking is a merely well-planned
system of fraud, and who will understand you, though
your explanation be as clear as crystal, and as logical
as Euclid?"</p>

<p>But the banker is a superior trickster to the gambler,
for the gambler is content to win your money,
without asking you to pay more than one per centage
for the use of his counters!</p>

<p>In a community of highly-educated men, the proposition
to gamble or start a bank, on the plan now prevailing,
would simply be laughed at.</p>

<p>But to show the burlesque extravagance of labor
allowing its blood to be sucked by these two classes
of vampires, let us suppose a case sufficiently limited
to admit of mathematical reasoning.</p>

<p><i>Ten</i> men with their families inhabit an island containing
ten hundred acres of land. <i>Nine</i> work, and
cultivate, sow, plant, weave, quarry, fish and <i>produce</i>
to their utmost ability. <i>One</i> turns banker, and, issues,
for purposes of exchange, one hundred bills, each
representing an acre of land. The security is unquestionable,
the land of certain value. The other <i>nine</i>
pay him interest for the use of his bills, which they
use as a means of exchange amongst themselves.
The banker lives on part of his income by exchanging
it for labor and produce, but he finds that he can
live on the value of five acres&mdash;there remain five due
to him. This must be paid him in land. At the
end of twenty years he has <i>two</i> hundred acres, and
supposing the rest of the community to have prospered
equally, each of his fellow-islanders will possess
a fraction less than eighty-nine acres. In this calculation,
also, I have omitted to consider compound
interest. In reality, if the banker lived to be an old
man, and speculated cleverly, he might very well
become the possessor of the whole island, and its
inhabitants his slaves. In the same way a cunning
gambler would win the whole island at faro, or rouge
et noir, with infallible certainty. The reign of bankers,
speculators and gamblers has succeeded that of
feudal lords. It is equally oppressive and absurd. In
England and France it has become a bondage of the
most agonizing description. In America it would
soon arrive at the same point but for the resource of
<i>flight</i> from the horrors of civilized barbarism, which
our extent of territory or vast tracts of unoccupied
lands offer, and for the grand army of philosophers
who even now are (thanks to the free speech and free
press of a free country) disseminating those mighty
and radical truths which, ere long, will be seen to prove
the banker with his antitype the forger, as vile
an excrescence of ignorant childhood in thought, as
the professional gambler or the representative form
of government.</p>

<p>It is time to speak when in our great cities a poet
or a workman&mdash;that is, a simple "son of man" can
scarcely find a spot whereon to lay his head, owing
to the exorbitant rents artificially forced up by the
sham-money conspiracy. It is time to speak when,
instead of working and producing even the slightest
benefit to society at large, whole classes of men (as
in the old world of tyranny and pauperism) devote
themselves to the mean and useless careers of the
banker, stock-broker and gambler! It is time to
speak when, as in degraded Europe, the imposture
called government is carried on by corrupt so-called
majorities in defiance of <i>individual sovereignty</i> and
common sense; that a corruptly-elected President
and a corruptly-elected Legislature, with their lazy
followers, may divide that other Old World villainy
the budget, derived from national taxation (that is
plunder) amongst them!</p>

<p>No wonder men turn thieves, gamblers, anything,
to escape the dire fate of the workman&mdash;that is, the
slave, the drudge, the pauper, the <i>victim!</i></p>

<p>No wonder poets die in despair, or wander ragged
and penniless in a land which the curses of government,
bankers and desperadoes yet desolate. But my
dear slant-browed friends in Wall street, my very
eloquent friends in Congress, and my very devil-may-care
friends in the countless petty robbers' caves called
gambling-hells, all over the land, a day is at hand
when men will begin to suspect, as <i>we</i> of the advanced
guard <i>know</i>, that in an educated community where
every man is armed, and ready to defend his liberty,
where public opinion can be expressed without check,
it may not be absolutely necessary to pay a crowd of
men called a government, to prevent us from eating
one another, or a foreign foe from eating us. Some
suspicion may then dawn that letters can be forwarded
without a government post-office, and that public
lands can be more justly appropriated to the use of
those who have nothing, than to the profit of the
grasping and idle speculator. It may also prove that,
in an enlightened society, public justice is quite as
effectual in repressing crime as public law. In a
word, it may prove that public <i>liberty</i> is quite as
natural a system as public <i>government</i>, and that the
Presidential, Congressional and Senatorial parody of
King, Lords and Commons, was no such grand
invention after all!</p>

<p>In those days, men may also suspect the feasibility
of giving one another credit, and employing a circulating
medium to represent value, without paying
highly respectable bankers three or four times over
for the privilege of using their very valuable autographs.
In those days, the idea that a man should
first lend his money, and receive interest for it from
the State (deposit stock), then issue notes upon it, and
lend it a second time, a third, a fourth time, at interest
to the community, will appear rather too funny
to be realized!</p>

<p>Finally, I do not think in those days that professional
gamblers will find many persons ignorant
enough to sit down deliberately to play a game in
which the chances are against them to begin with,
and all possibility of cheating on the side of the
banker.</p>

<div class="center">

<p id="c19">CHAPTER XIX.</p>

<p>OLD LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE.</p>

</div>

<p>THEY were a queer set of faces round the table at
which Confidence Bob presided. There was a sallow,
orientally-visaged gentleman, with a long nose, half-closed
sleepy eyes, and a neatly trimmed moustache,
who looked the personification of incapacity-to-be-surprised-at-anything.
There was a light-haired,
close-cropped, close-shaven, bull-necked young man,
whose air of resolute roguery was Anglo-Saxon to the
very marrow. There was a big red-whiskered Irishman,
with large coarse features, and small eyes, surrounded
by creases, whose soul appeared to have had
hard work to make the body a fit medium for the
acute observation required in a gambler's existence.
Then there was a clerical-looking man, of methodical
mien, in a very high shirt collar, with large silver-rimmed
spectacles, and grey hair&mdash;an old stager,
slow but sure; not to mention a dusky Spaniard,
who might have sat for a portrait of Mephistopheles.
All these were gamblers by profession, agglomerated,
heaven knows how, around the newly-started
bank.</p>

<p>Most of them had queer stories to tell of wonderful
tricks, runs of luck, dire catastrophies, and revolver-and-bowie-knife
adventures, which, as a general rule,
happened "when they were in California."</p>

<p>"When I was in California"&mdash;that is the starting
point with a gambler. A gambler who has not
visited the golden shores of the Pacific, is not thought
much of by his tribe; unless he has the wonderful
merit of being in funds. And gamblers, like the rest
of the world, revere success above all other virtues.
There is a savage logic in this religion of the trader
and the gambler. Of internal forces they cannot
judge, from the weakness of their intellectual totalities.
Their reasoning and imaginative powers, being
feebly developed, perception of present fact governs
them. What they see they believe.</p>

<p>The moment the well-dressed stranger entered the
room, Confidence Bob recognized his superior demon
and financial lord and master&mdash;the <i>Alterer</i>.</p>

<p>Let us still call him by the name with which habit
has made us familiar.</p>

<p>No sign of recognition was exchanged between
Lucifer and his imps. By this time they were well
drilled in their duty.</p>

<p>The other gamblers eyed the new-comer with curiosity.
There was something in his keen bright eye
that awed them into a vague admiration. He did
not look like a pigeon come to be plucked. Nevertheless
he began to play, staking fifty dollars at a
time. In ten minutes, he had won five hundred.
The uninitiated band looked aghast. A third of
their leader's professed capital was gone already. To
them the Alterer was an utter stranger.</p>

<p>The bull-necked Anglo-Saxon, by the time another
five hundred dollars had been transferred by Confidence
Bob to his mysterious patron, grew quite nervous,
and called to mind a pleasing reminiscence of
a "house" with which he had been connected, of a
lucky stranger, like the present, and a desperate skirmish&mdash;ending
in a half inanimate body thrown recklessly
from a back window, and a general escapade,
or, as the Mexicans would say, estampede, of the
whole band from the establishment.</p>

<p>But Confidence Bob remained unmoved. Presently
the run of luck changed, and the stranger lost hundred
after hundred. Meanwhile, a new player appeared
upon the scene. He was a tall, cadaverous-looking,
powerful man, with a ragged beard, moustaches and
hair, which, from the mixture of yellow and grey,
appeared of a greenish color. His eyes were light
blue, and gleamed with a steady lurid brightness.
His eyebrows were dark, arched and tufted. His
nose was long and aquiline. His mouth a line, the
lips being so thin and compressed as to be nearly
imperceptible. His jaws were lean, his forehead high,
narrow and wrinkled. His figure was gaunt, his neck
scraggy, and his limbs long and loosely hung. His
age was perhaps five and forty. The deep lines of his
face appeared to be rather the result of care and
thought than of age. His dress was that of a beggar.</p>

<p>A miserable frock-coat of brown cloth, stained,
threadbare and torn, was buttoned across his chest in
order to conceal to the utmost a dirty blue-check
shirt, and a tattered vest, on which, five buttons out
of six were wanting. His pantaloons were black;
but what a black! what a miserable, shiny, napless,
whitish pretence to blackness! what a meeting of
extremes! His boots without soles, with heels worn
down to the quick,&mdash;well, well, it was a sad joke to
call them boots at all! They were indeed on their
last legs, for how they could be taken off and put on
again, even once more, without going to pieces and
utterly perishing, was an inconceivable problem.
On his head, to crown all, was a broad-brimmed
green felt-hat, the very incarnation of shapeless
limpness, and unrecorded antiquity.</p>

<p>Yet, this poverty-stricken wretch was a gambler,
and a gambler too of no common order. He was
well-known to several of the men present.</p>

<p>"Here comes old Latitude and Longitude," said
the long-nosed gambler.</p>

<p>"'E come yesterday," said the Slinker, "and lost a
dollar and an 'arf."</p>

<p>"What's a narf?" said the bull-necked young man.</p>

<p>"Give me counters for these," said the ragged
gambler, cautiously handing across the table, a dollar
note and silver to the amount of two dollars more.</p>

<p>Confidence Bob handed him six fifty cent counters,
and the strange being commenced playing away, not
the earnings, but the <i>beggings</i> of a week, with a look
of the most intense eagerness.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he had doubled his capital. He
staked boldly on the knave, and three times running
the knave did not deceive him, even knaves know
pity. He had won twenty-four dollars. He transferred
his stake to the ace, and still won&mdash;who trusts
to number one is generally fortunate. He pushed
his forty-eight dollars over to the <i>queen</i>. The faithless
sex betrayed his confidence. He lost. Confidence
Bob swept away his pile of counters.</p>

<p>"If I had only coppered!" muttered the ragged
gambler, "I was nearly doing it. Ah! all is gone,
and I have not eaten to-day."</p>

<p>"Take this," said the Alterer, thrusting a half
dollar piece into his hand unperceived; and then even
Berkeley's hard nature somewhat relenting at the
aspect of the unlucky one, he whispered, "I will
add a five dollar bill, if you will promise not to play
with it."</p>

<p>"No," whispered the beggar hoarsely, "give me a
three, and let me try once more!"</p>

<p>The maker of money in a moment of caprice
handed the desired bill to the stranger, who speedily
staked and lost it, as well as the fifty-cent piece, with
unwavering fanaticism.</p>

<p>"You are out of luck to-day, Mr. Peter Quartz,"
said Confidence Bob, on whom the fierce blue eyes
of the ragged gambler were fixed vacantly.</p>

<p>"Out of luck!" growled the beggar, "yes, I am
out of luck, and yet what are all your paltry gains
compared to the treasure which is mine. If you but
knew the latitude and longitude!"<p>

<p>"Well; what if we did?" said the long-nosed
gambler, coolly puffing a cigar.</p>

<p>"You would know where the gold is&mdash;that is all!"</p>

<p>By this time the Alterer found himself a loser by
some trifling sum, and having played his part and
made his observations, lounged carelessly out of the
room.</p>

<p>The ragged gambler followed him closely.</p>

<p>"Sir!" said the mendicant, "I know where
gold is to be had for the taking, I know the latitude
and longitude&mdash;if you can aid me, if a ship can be
obtained, I will share with you wealth without limit&mdash;thousands&mdash;millions"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"My friend," said the counterfeiter, "I am no
ship-owner."</p>

<p>"But I offer you the secret of unbounded wealth!"
said the beggar earnestly.</p>

<p>"Which I already possess," said the Alterer,
gloomily.</p>

<p>"But it is of gold&mdash;solid gold&mdash;gold by the
hundred weight, by the ton, by the ship-load, that I
speak!&mdash;It is to be had for the fetching."</p>

<p>"I can dispense with the trouble of fetching," said
the grim jester. "My friend, did you ever hear of
the philospher's stone and the alchymists?"</p>

<p>"What miserable folly!" groaned the ragged gambler;
"dreams, visions, insanity?"</p>

<p>"Look at me!" said the Alterer.</p>

<p>"I look."</p>

<p>"Good; you <i>see</i> an alchymist before you."</p>

<p>"<i>What!</i> you can make gold of lead, of iron, of
some baser metal?"</p>

<p>"Of yet cheaper materials."</p>

<p>"To any extent!&mdash;But this is folly."</p>

<p>"Without limit, save my will. Here, take a
quarter, and dine in the devil's name," said Berkeley
striding hastily away. "It is useless to give the
poor wretch money," thought the counterfeiter, "he
would only return and throw it into the hellish cash-box.
He is evidently a lunatic, whose mania is some
sunken treasure or fabulous Eldorado."</p>

<p>"Fool!" said the beggar to himself, "fool! to
waste time in jesting when I had half made up my
mind to offer my secret at a bargain. But it is still
mine!" he murmured proudly, "and no other man
living knows the latitude and longitude but myself"</p>

<p id="c20">CHAPTER XX.</p>

<p>GOLD.</p>

</div>

<p>"COLUMBIA," said Mr. Yonkers one evening, when
taking tea at home with his daughter, Mrs. Yonkers
being absent on a visit, "Columbia, what has become
of your literary friend, Mr. Mondel?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"He has not been here lately?"</p>

<p>"No, papa."</p>

<p>"Why does he not come? I wished to see him.
Robert Lax tells me they are fitting up a ship with
new engines, that will give steam the go-by. If anybody
but Lax went into it I should not believe in it.
But Lax is a smart man&mdash;very. You have seen
Robert Lax?"</p>

<p>"Yes, papa."</p>

<p>Columbia spoke in a sweet, subdued tone, endeavoring
to conceal her listlessness and depression from
her father, whose rough inquisition she dreaded, notwithstanding
his unbounded affection for her, as testified
from her earliest youth, in the humoring of all
her delicate tastes and caprices, no matter how little
Mr. Yonkers was capable of understanding them.</p>

<p>"They say Robert Lax is worth three millions,"
said Mr. Yonkers.</p>

<p>No Indian worshipping his three-headed god could
have possibly felt or expressed by his looks a deeper
reverence than did Harrison B. Yonkers, by the
solemn gravity of his tone, imply for this three-millioned
commercialist.</p>

<p>"His daughter is a fine girl," pursued Mr. Yonkers,
reflectively&mdash;"a great catch for this scribbling
friend of yours, if old Lax gives him a chance.
Why; Columbia, you look as if you were not listening
to me. I say that Mr. Mondel might make his
fortune by marrying Julia Lax, by a much shorter
cut than inventing steam-engines."</p>

<p>Columbia was silent. Her father's careless talk
threw her into a train of the saddest and most bitter
reflections. In spite of her conviction of his unworthiness,
she still felt an undefinable interest in the
destinies of her adventurous lover. Strange to say,
even the revolting secret of his by-gone intrigues
with her step-mother did not wound her so deeply as
the idea of his irrevocable union with Robert Lax's
heiress. A woman who has once loved a man finds
considerable difficulty in imagining that another
woman can be otherwise than flattered by his preference.
Columbia knew that, except in point of
wealth, all comparison between herself and Julia Lax
was preposterous. She had frequently encountered
the heiress in question at evening parties. Miss Lax
was what men usually designate as an uncommonly
fine girL She had a tall, splendidly-developed figure,
fine dark eyes and abundant ringlets, and was decidedly
one of the best-dressed women in New York.
It is true that she was somewhat stupid&mdash;perhaps
even slightly vulgar in her manners, but then&mdash;her
father had three millions, and Mondel was unprincipled
and ambitious.</p>

<p>"Why, Columbia, you do not seem to relish this
idea of a match between your poetical friend and
Miss Lax?"</p>

<p>I assure you papa," said Columbia, "it is a matter
of perfect indifference to me whether Mr. Mondel
marries Miss Lax or not."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" said Mr. Yonkers. "Now, do you
know it occurred to me the other day that you did
take some interest in Mr. Mondel's matrimonial proceedings?"</p>

<p>"You are quite mistaken, papa, you are quite mistaken,"
said Columbia, coldly.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it," said Mr. Yonkers, "these
writing men are never worth a cent, and make
uncommonly bad husbands. In nine cases out of
ten, they are <i>rou&eacute;s</i> and spendthrifts. I heard the
other day of one of them who deserted his wife and
ran away with one of the female horse-riders from
the circus. I never thought much of your scribblers,"
pursued Mr. Yonkers. "There was Fox, I recollect,
who used to edit the <i>Atlantic Journal</i>, and levied
black-mail upon every one whose credit was at all
shakey."</p>

<p>"But, papa," said Columbia, "you surely do not
confound Mr. Mondel with such miserable creatures.
He is bad enough, no doubt"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Columbia paused; she felt that she was about to
commit herself.</p>

<p>Mr. Yonkers, however, with the persistent obstinacy
that characterizes some men, in pursuing a
subject to the death&mdash;or, as journalists say&mdash;running
it into the ground, returned once more to the charge.</p>

<p>"You see, Columbia, as you are now three and twenty,
and have refused so many offers from men
of the highest respectability and position, I took it
into my head that as you were so fond of books and
literature, perhaps nothing but a book-reading and
book-making man would suit you. Now, what I
want is to see you happy. So don't be afraid of
telling me the truth. If this versifying gentleman
pleases you, say so, and money shan't stand in the way
of your happiness. I do not suppose he is worth a
cent, but he seems a straightforward, manly fellow&mdash;I
met him at Robert Lax's to-day, and had some talk
with him&mdash;this ship of his may turn out a great speculation,
after all. So, if my suspicions are correct,
as Mrs. Yonkers is out of the way, just tell me all
about it, and how it stands between you."</p>

<p>Columbia, touched by this kindness and generosity
on the part of her father, rose gently, put her arm
round his neck, kissed his rubicund cheek, and said
in a very low voice&mdash;so low that it was almost a
whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear father, thank you for your
kind intentions; but you are quite mistaken. Mr.
Mondel is nothing to me beyond a mere acquaintance&mdash;nothing
more: absolutely nothing."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Mr. Yonkers, "say no more
about it Colly; I went on the principle that birds of
a feather flock together, but I see that two of a trade
can't agree is your motto. By-the-by, a curious thing
happened to-day. A mad begging fellow came to my
office, and asked me if I dealt in bullion, and whether
I wanted to know where it was to be had by the ton
for the taking. He said he knew the latitude and
longitude, and offered to go halves with me if I would
fit up a ship, and send him after it. It was only a
three months' voyage, I think, he said. He looked
as ragged as an Irish emigrant, though his face
and talk were American. I gave him a dollar to get
rid of him. It's astonishing what queer people come
boring a man who has money with their wild-goose
schemes. Imagine a fellow in rags coolly asking me
to risk ten thousand dollars on his bare word! Why,
a man came to me one day, and offered to make diamonds
out of coal."</p>

<p>"But, papa," said Columbia, "the chemists at
Paris have done it."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," said Mr. Yonkers;
"but this speculative friend of mine said it took a ton
of coal to make a square inch of diamond. I advanced
him the money to set up his furnaces, and I never
saw him again from that day to this. No, no," said
Mr. Yonkers, "I'm not to be taken in by your golden
romances&mdash;though I suspect the fellow was mad, and
I'm not sorry I gave the dollar."</p>

<p>At this moment Mrs. Yonkers entered.</p>

<p>By a curious coincidence, not three minutes elapsed
before Mr. John Berkeley was announced.</p>

<p>"Ah! Mr. Berkeley, how are you?" said Yonkers.
"Of course you have heard that there is a rise in the
&mdash;&mdash; stock, you lucky dog, you. What a fool I was
to sell out the day before yesterday. However, I
don't care much for your stocks now; I stick to the
solids."</p>

<p>"Gold is the true metal," said the Alterer; and,
turning his bright eye on Mr. Yonkers, he gave the
rich man a very peculiar look.</p>

<p>It was the sort of look which a crouching tiger
throws on the fated buffalo from his jungle.</p>

<p>In that look was expressed Mr. Harrison B. Yonkers'
destiny.</p>

<p>THE BEGGAR AND THE POET.</p>

</div>

<p>THERE are some faces which attract confidence.
Mondel's was one of them. Though somewhat stern,
there was a certain noble gentleness about its
ordinary expression, which caused strangers to feel
secure against a haughty or careless repulse of their
advances. To this peculiarity the poet was indebted
for many a strange confession, and wonderful history
recounted to him by people whom he beheld for the
first time, and often never set eyes on again.</p>

<p>It is by listening to the life-stories of the obscure,
and comparing them with the biographies of the
great, that a great writer forms his gallery of studies,
and completes his knowledge of human nature.</p>

<p>Mondel, as we have seen, was a great student of
character. No wonder that his attention was attracted
to a face so striking as that of the ragged gambler,
with whose general appearance the reader is already
familiar.</p>

<p>It was in the park at the Battery.</p>

<p>Mondel was looking at the water. His birth upon
the ocean had left in his mind an unbounded love of
the sea, which, but for the yet more potent influence
of beauty, would have infallibly made a sailor of
the poet.</p>

<p>When a boy, he was a hundred times on the eve
of running away, and trying his fortune on the great
waters, but for some sweet bright-eyed little girl,
whose loss he could not bear to contemplate. Mondel
often said that he could not recollect the time
when he was not in love.</p>

<p>At six years of age he had quite a passion for a
young lady with ringlets that hung to her waist, and
a blue sash.</p>

<p>At ten, he was quite serious about the matter, and
promised marriage to a blonde syren of nine and a
half, but quite as precocious in sentiment as himself.</p>

<p>At fourteen, he grew desperately enamored of a
third young enchantress, and wrote poems to her, in
which "tresses" rhymed to "caresses," "charms"
to "arms," and "grace" to "embrace." Finally,
before his going abroad to complete his education,
the engagement was solemnly ratified.</p>

<p>At fifteen&mdash;O fickleness of man!&mdash;we find him
"compromised" with a young French lady's-maid;
and at sixteen, really in the vortex of a <i>grande
passion</i> for a German baron's daughter, which ends
in a fever&mdash;a declaration&mdash;an interchange of vows&mdash;a
correspondence&mdash;and three years of hope, dreams,
despair and poetry.</p>

<p>Love makes the poet&mdash;what else?</p>

<p>Thus, Venus, daughter of the sea, watched over the
destinies of her sea-born votary, and vowed that their
common father&mdash;Ocean&mdash;should not deprive her
temple of so ardent a hierophant.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Mondel had been frequently at sea,
and was not only a voyager of the deep, but was well
versed in all the mysteries of a ship's rigging and
management. In technical parlance, he "knew the
ropes," and how to splice them. He could go aloft,
was a good hand at steering, and possessed that
rarest quality in a landsman, a perfect theoretical and
practical knowledge of the science of navigation.</p>

<p>As he had, most certainly, never spent above three
or four months of his life on shipboard, his acquisition
of the above-mentioned knowledge was a mystery to his
acquaintance. But Mondel had acquired, in fact,
more than a smattering of the arts and sciences of
men. Vast and shadowy projects had moved like
phantoms in the abysses of his all-grasping soul. It
was his business to know what life meant, and he
knew it.</p>

<p>He stood looking at the water, and watching the
white sails of the vessels as they glittered in the rays
of the setting sun, when he suddenly perceived that
a man was watching him with a singular interest.
The ragged gambler&mdash;for as we have already intimated,
it was he and no other&mdash;presently approached
the poet, and said bluntly, yet humbly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir, will you give me a dollar?"

<p>"With pleasure," said Mondel, inclining his body
courteously towards the strange mendicant, "but I
have not a dollar in my pocket."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear it!" said the beggar gravely.</p>

<p>"Your sorrow is natural," said, Mondel, "pray
accept my apologies for detaining you, but I must
first get change for a half-eagle, which is all I have
about me. I regret that I cannot spare more than a
dollar at the moment, or you should have it all."</p>

<p>"Do not mention it," said the mendicant, rather
puzzled by the singular humor of the grave gentleman;
"a dollar is all I want."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would not mind going across the
road, and getting change?" said Mondel quietly.</p>

<p>The beggar looked at Mondel with an intensity
that gave a wizard air to his marked and wrinkled
visage.</p>

<p>"Are you joking?" said he, half angrily, half
admiringly.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," said Mondel "here is the
piece of gold."</p>

<p>"I will return directly," said the beggar. "You
believe that I shall return?"</p>

<p>"I am too poor to afford to lose four dollars," said
Mondel; "besides, I have reasons for knowing that
you will return."</p>

<p>"Pray what are they?"</p>

<p>"Your language is good, you have an intelligent
brow, and a strong frame. You are nearly fifty,
and"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"A beggar, and in rags," completed the mendicant
coolly.</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"Well, sir?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, you must be either stupidly honest, or
you are a rogue who has sadly neglected his opportunities."</p>

<p>"Wait till I return; and we will speak further,
with your consent sir," said the beggar.</p>

<p>Mondel waited patiently.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour&mdash;half an hour&mdash;an hour
elapsed, and no beggar re&auml;ppeared.</p>

<p>The great physiognomist looked at his watch every
minute. At length he resolved to return home, ill
satisfied at having emptied his purse in order to try
an experiment in human nature.</p>

<p>But just as he was about to leave the park, a hand lightly
touched his arm</p>

<p>It was the mendicant.</p>

<p>"I thought you had forgotten me?" said Mondel.</p>

<p>"I have done worse; I have robbed you," said the
beggar.</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"I have lost your money."</p>

<p>"<i>Lost</i> it?"</p>

<p>"I have gambled it away. Oh! if I had not coppered
on the queen! Zounds! I had run up to a
hundred and sixty, when the devil possessed me to
copper. I'll never trust to a presentiment again!"</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Mondel.</p>

<p>"You despise me; you regard me as a thief?"
said the mendicant gambler despondently.</p>

<p>"I do not despise you. As for your being a thief,
it is your misfortune. Most men <i>are</i> thieves when
opportunity offers suitable to their idiosyncrasies."</p>

<p>"You do not then wish to punish me for stealing your money?"</p>

<p>"No;" said Mondel, "I do not believe in punishment.
I trusted you, it was my own weakness."</p>

<p>"Sir!" said the beggar, standing erect, and confronting
Mondel with the air of one <i>Grand Seigneur</i>
facing another, "you are a great man! May I ask
your name?"</p>

<p>"Dudley Mondel."</p>

<p>"Mondel, the poet."</p>

<p>"Some critics call me so."</p>

<p>"Are you rich or poor?"</p>

<p>"Too poor to continue your acquaintance I fear,"
said Mondel, puzzled by the audacious impudence of
the beggar.</p>

<p>"Poet Mondel, you are a millionaire!" said the
beggar, with the air of a Jupiter, looking calmly into
the eyes of his victim.</p>

<p>"In petto," said Mondel "though"&mdash;he murmured&mdash;"if
my <i>ship</i> succeed"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your <i>ship</i>&mdash;you have a <i>ship</i>?" cried the beggar.</p>

<p>"One that can cut water like a sword-fish!" replied
Mondel, still wondering what his curious acquaintance
was driving at.</p>

<p>"You are a prince!" said the beggar&mdash;" an imperial
prince!"</p>

<p>"Are you mad?" said Mondel, looking sternly at
the beggar, but detecting nothing resembling lunacy
in his exaltation.</p>

<p>"Fools say so," replied the mendicant scornfully;
"Hear my story, and judge for yourself. My name
is Peter Quartz. I am a gambler, it is the vice of
my destiny. For twenty-seven years I have begged
and gambled and starved in rags! Why? Because
I knew all the time that I possessed the secret of
unbounded wealth. For twenty-seven years I have
dreamed of the realization of my power, of the possession
of the treasures which I, and I alone, know
to exist in such limitless profusion. For twenty-seven
years I have gambled daily in the hope of
some day making one grand haul, and fitting out
the enterprise, which has been the vision of my life.
Never have I communicated to a human being the
secret which has been my curse. To-day I have met
my master. When I gambled away your money I
made a vow, and that vow was, that if I lost, my
secret should be yours; it shall&mdash;you shall know it
in an instant. Listen: latitude A B longitude X Y!
There! You are a millionaire of millionaires, a
king of kings&mdash;the Golden Island is yours. I give
it to you&mdash;to you and to your heirs for ever!"</p>

<p>Mondel looked steadily at the ragged enthusiast,
and saw that he spoke sincerely and sanely; It was
given to the man of genius to recognize what, to the
cunning counterfeiter and the shrewd merchant was
denied. What is the knowledge of the world but
the knowledge of man's nature? For the first time
for seven-and-twenty years, Peter Quartz, the supposed
lunatic gambler found a patient listener to his
extravagances.</p>

<p id="c22">CHAPTER XXII.</p>

<p>PETER QUARTZ.</p>

</div>

<p>"TWENTY-SEVEN years ago," began the beggar,
when seated after supper in Mondel's study, "twenty-seven
years ago, a ship was wrecked one dark and
stormy night, on the coast of a small island in the
South Pacific Ocean. In that ship I, Peter Quartz,
was a passenger. The captain was my relative, and
some minutes before the ship ran on the rocks, he
happened to tell me the latitude and longitude
which, as I was very tired of the voyage, and very
anxious to reach port, I most particularly noticed at
the time, and ever afterwards most carefully remembered.
Indeed, I was still poring over the ship's
position on the chart, in the cabin, when we felt the
ship strike. A few hours later the <i>Argo</i> (that was
her name) went to pieces, and I being the best
swimmer on board, though no sailor, was, so far as
I have ever been able to ascertain, the only one on
board who escaped.</p>

<p>"Imagine my horror on discovering with the light
of morning that the island was one vast barren rock
rising towards a crater in the centre, at the bottom
of which, but utterly inaccessible from the perpendicularity
of the descent was, strange to say, a large
lake of water. There was not a vestige of animal
or vegetable life on the island, which was altogether
scarcely two miles in diameter. But my horror at
this discovery was soon equalled by my amazement
and temporary delight at discovering that the whole
mineral mass was impregnated with gold to a degree
never known in any mines yet discovered. In some
places, tons and tons of pure gold were seen in
masses streaking the less brilliant quartz, and glittering
in the sunshine, whilst huge round lumps of the
pure metal, as if dropped molten from lofty precipices,
like shot from the summit of a short tower,
were to be picked up on one side of the mountain to
an extent which defied all computation. I myself
saw several as large as ordinary melons.  But my
amazement did not last long. I reflected that, to a
man on a desert island, gold was a useless commodity.
There being neither food, shelter nor water
attainable, I was but too glad to take the first chance
of escape from this El Dorado of horror which
offered itself. The wreck had entirely disappeared.
It was almost a dead calm. The burning sun fell
cruelly on my uncovered head, when I suddenly
descried a dark object on the rocks at some little
distance from the shore. It was the smallest of our
boats. I succeeded in launching it, and shipping
some stores which had been drifted ashore from the
wreck, I eventually put to sea with perhaps five
hundred pounds weight of gold as ballast. A strong
breeze sprang up, I drifted perhaps a thousand miles
to the eastward, and was capsized by a gust of wind
within two hundred yards of a Spanish brig which
picked me up almost starved to death, and master
of the most valuable secret in the world!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my mind gave way from the physical
sufferings I had undergone, and when I awoke in the
seamen's hospital at Valparaiso, to the possession
of my reason, no one regarded my miserable attempts
to express in Spanish the wonderful discovery I had
made. A Yankee captain shipped me as a green-hand,
and in process of time I reached New Orleans.
There I was utterly without means, and fell into the
most deplorable poverty. In vain I told my story to
hundreds of men. All shook their heads, all either
believed me mad or monomaniac. One only was
tempted to try the adventure. But after making
some preparations, the idea struck him, that I might
not have remembered rightly the latitude and longitude.
In vain I offered to demonstrate my wonderful
memory for figures, and declared that I could point out
on the chart the point which my acute sense of locality
had indelibly impressed upon my mind. Besides, I
was always in a peculiar dilemma. If I described the
true aspect of the island, it was treated as a fairy tale
or madman's dream. If I moderated my description,
it was of late nothing better than California after all.
In a word, for twenty-seven years, I have vainly
striven to find a man to believe the simple story of
a wrecked man, because to a world of Mammon-worshippers
the story appears too good to be true, as
if Nature could not as easily lavish gold as iron, or
any other nominally less valuable substance!"</p>

<p>"Then you never communicated the latitude and
longitude to any one?" said Mondel.</p>

<p>"Never," replied the gambler, "though I have
often offered to do so for the merest trifle, say a
thousand dollars in the extremity of my misery."</p>

<p>"Did you ever try Wall street?" said Mondel,
ironically.</p>

<p>"From end to end. Folly and meanness!" replied
the gambler bitterly.</p>

<p>"Yes, they are tolerably blind. They can neither
tell an honest man from a knave, nor a man of genius
from a fool. Yet, they have built my ship, and paid
for my engines!"</p>

<p>"How did you persuade them?"</p>

<p>"By humoring their pigmy souls. By calling a
grand invention a modest improvement. By talking
of a revolution in machinery as a slight simplification.
By coming down, in a word, to the level of
their vulgar and uncultivated intelligences. One
Robert Lax is my tool; he knows nothing, understands
nothing, and obeys my will, because he fancies
that he outwits and patronizes me. Like all
your men who grow rich by trading speculation, he has a
sort of cunning which is almost an instinct of self-interest.
There is, however, one thing that his
cunning will scarcely teach him to suspect; and that
will be the cruise of our new ship to this isle of gold
which you report of."</p>

<p>"And you believe me?" said the beggar eagerly.</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"You doubt my word?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"I doubt your sanity and memory. I am a skeptic,
but an investigating skeptic. I will inquire."</p>

<p>"Inquire? Inquire of whom? Since none but
myself know the island's existence?"</p>

<p>"That is my affair," said Mondel. "Let me see
you to-morrow. Here is money for present necessities.
Good night!"</p>

<p>"Good night! may God defend you from doubting
me!" said the ragged gambler piously.</p>

<p>Mondel sent for Mrs. Normer.</p>

<p>"My dear madam," said he, "I wish to magnetize
you to-night."</p>

<p>"You know I dislike it."</p>

<p>"It is to ascertain a fact which will make all our
fortunes."</p>

<p>"I submit, but do not exhaust me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Normer was a remarkable somnambulist.
Her presentiments even in her ordinary state were
wonderfully correct. She was a prophetess if ever
there was one, and in a state of clairvoyance, her
vision was transcendent. Mondel looked steadily at
her, made a few passes, smoothed her hair, and
murmured in a gentle but imperious tone the word
"Sleep!"</p>

<p>In a few minutes, the eyes of the somnambulist
opened with that glassy look peculiar to magnetized
persons, and Mondel put his all-important question.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the somnambulist, "yes, I see the
island&mdash;it is gold, all gold&mdash;but, in the centre, there
is"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>At this moment, they were interrupted by the
arrival of Cope, and despite his interest in the
question he was propounding, Mondel's thoughts
were so distracted by the idea of news from Columbia,
that he did not hear the remainder of the
reply. A new idea struck him&mdash;he signed to Cope
to excuse him, and put, in a low voice, a new
question to the somnambulist.</p>

<p>After a long pause, the somnambulist replied, as if
with a great effort, her brows painfully contracted.</p>

<p>"She loves you as you are, and hates you as you
seem."</p>

<p>"A truly Delphic Oracle;" said Cope, smiling.</p>

<p>"I see hope in the distance," said Mondel,
abstractedly.</p>

<p>"It must be beyond the horizon then;" said Cope,
bluntly, anxious to cure his friend of what he considered
a fatal monomania.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I saw Miss Columbia this morning. I spoke of
the poem you published last week, and said you were
looking ill of late."</p>

<p>"And she?"</p>

<p>"Changed the subject and asked me if I had been
to the opera lately!"</p>

<p>"The devil!" exclaimed Mondel.</p>

<p>"Yes, love is the devil, and so is hate. Believe
me, that if a woman dislikes you, it is a law of
nature."</p>

<p>"But I fancied once"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"We all have fancied"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Her looks, her expression"&mdash;&mdash;

<p>"We must judge by actions."</p>

<p>"Well, well," sighed the love-sick poet, "let me
release my clairvoyante, and we will go out and get
some wine. Wine! ye Gods! how I wish I could
drink and be happy like the"&mdash;&mdash;

<p>"Human swine we see reeling out of late drinking
saloons, eh?" said Cope, sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Like those who <i>can</i> forget," said Mondel, gloomily.
"But for men like myself, there is no oblivion, save
in death's 'coal black wine.'"</p>

<p>"I always hated the idea of a black draught," said
Cope, laughing.</p>

<p>"By the way," said Mondel, "what do you say to
a cruise in the Pacific?"</p>

<p>"As first-cabin passenger I should not mind, for I
don't believe in the dignity of labor a bit. I once
did duty as a cabin boy, so I think I know what sea
life is."</p>

<p>"You shall be historiographer of the expedition,
like Alexander Dumas on the Montpensier journey to
Spain."</p>

<p>"Good; that will suit me," said Cope, "when do
you start?"</p>

<p>"As soon as the ship is ready."</p>

<p>"But what will Robert Lax say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; I shall not ask his opinion."</p>

<p>"You are not going to turn pirate?" said Cope
suspiciously, for since his misadventure in love,
Mondel was terribly reckless in his projects&mdash;at least
in his conversation.</p>

<p>"Not this time."</p>

<p>"What is the object then?"</p>

<p>"Gold."</p>

<p>"Then I'm with you, for gold is a substance I have
seen very little of lately, and I'm tired of making
paper money out of ideas."</p>

<p>How cheerfully Cope uttered these last words! If
John Berkeley could have heard them, or any of his
fellow rogues, the stock brokers, note shavers, railway
scrip forgers, &amp;c., how strangely the suspicion would
have crept over them that working for the good of
mankind, is better than cheating for its ill.</p>

<p>O ye generation of bankers, brokers and landsharks!
how little does all your bogus labor weigh
in the eyes of the Spirits of the Universe, compared
to one page created by the hand of the poet, one
sketch of the artist, aye, or one really useful pot or
pan, garment or instrument, which the hand of the
workman produces! Tribe of locusts, shuffling
loafers and idlers of commerce, incubi on humanity,
devourers of industry; is not John Berkeley, the
alterer and counterfeiter, your true culmination and
representative? Answer me idle and non-producing
tribes, human cyphers! Answer me&mdash;and tremble.</p>

<p>The first trial trip came off brilliantly.
Nothing could exceed the amazement of the New Yorkers at
beholding a vessel without sails, without smoke,
without paddle-wheels, or screw propeller,
cutting through the water at a rate never yet attained by the
fastest ocean steamers. Yet "Captain" Mondel
assured the gentlemen of the press who came on
board "to see the elephant," that he had not even
attempted to put the vessel to her full speed. But
what perplexed and amazed every one was the news
that the motive power was mercury <i>not</i> vaporized&mdash;merely
warmed into life as it were&mdash;quite a gentle
process, managed without a particle of coal, the fuel
being&mdash;could you believe it?&mdash;gas generated on board
the vessel itself.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

</div>

<p>The reporting gentlemen, who, to do them justice,
are a most intelligent and quick-witted class of men,
were perfectly satisfied so far.</p>

<p>"But how do you propel your vessel?" they
inquired.</p>

<p>"By water pressure. The engine in fact does
nothing but continually raise a column of water,
which descends and escapes continually by two pipes
under the stern of the ship."</p>

<p>"Why do you reject sails?" said one of the reporters.</p>

<p>"Because I wish to spare men the hardest part of
a sailor's life&mdash;reefing and furling. Besides, if more
speed is wanted, why not use more powerful engines?
I can make engines three times as powerful, and yet
not consume one more particle of fuel. Heat is not
a thing to be measured by the amount of combustion,
but by subdivision and surface. It can be propagated
almost infinitely. My aim is to save labor, to
make the life of a seaman as pleasant as another."</p>

<p>"How broad in the beam your vessel is!" said
another visitor.</p>

<p>"It is little more," said Mondel, "than an oblong
box with a long sharp wedge-shaped cutwater. I do
not yet despair of setting an ark afloat which shall
resemble a block of houses with an engine of a hundred
thousand horse-power making a twenty-four
hours' business of the Atlantic ferry."</p>

<p>"Really captain, you jest?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least. The true plan of building a
grand ship is vertebrate. Each vertebra is a square
building complete in itself.  A number of these are
united by an external casing and keel, and all that
is wanting is the head-piece and the cut-water. On
that let all the art of the builder be expended, and
the more acute the angle of the wedge the better.
There never yet was built a ship which cut the
water as it should."</p>

<p>"How large should a ship then be to cross the
Atlantic according to your taste, sir?" said a pert
young inquirer from a Wall street paper.</p>

<p>"About a quarter of a mile long, and some sixty
to seventy yards beam," answered Mondel, tranquilly.</p>

<p>"By the way, you carry guns?" said an older
visitor, "but they appear to be only for show, and
look more like printing presses, if you will excuse
the remark."</p>

<p>"The artillery of the press is the most dangerous
in these times," said Mondel, "but the screw and
lever which you see are for the purpose of loading
these <i>air-cannon</i> (an improvement on the cannon and
imperfect air-guns) with compressed air, which here
supplies the place of powder. Neither are they
made of wood, as you probably imagine, but of vulcanized
India rubber, a substance both lighter and
cheaper than iron."</p>

<p>"Have you any other innovations on board?"</p>

<p>"A few. For example, an electric light at the
head of the vessel, gas laid on in every cabin, gas
cooking apparatus, and some interesting experiments
in preserved provisions, which I am trying for the
benefit of poor Jack, who, in an age of progress
might, I think, get something more palatable and
healthy than salt junk, bean soup, or 'plum duff'
and hard biscuit!"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said the elderly reporter, "I wish
you success, and all men like you!"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Mondel "I hope you will do
me the honor of dining on board&mdash;Ah, Mr. Lax, you
have arrived just in time. You dine with us, of
course (aside), these are gentlemen connected with
the leading newspapers."</p>

<p>"Then don't spare the champagne," said  Lax, "I
should like to see the ship well noticed. By the
by, when do you propose to try the trip to
Havana?"</p>

<p>"Next week; the stores are coming on board
already."</p>

<p>Robert Lax rubbed his hands, and eyed Mondel
complacently. He regarded that inventor as a
species of property which he had had the dexterity
to appropriate.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the devil of wild adventure and dark
projects stirred within the heart of the triumphant
but unhappy man of genius.</p>

<p>Oh, how willingly would he have given his ship, his
fame, his coming wealth, golden island and all, for
one line from the blonde Columbia, bidding him
return to her feet, and once more tell her that he
loved her better than the world!</p>

<p>But it was not to be.</p>

<p>He made one desperate attempt&mdash;in defiance of
all etiquette and propriety. He saw her carriage
standing at a shop-door. She was alone waiting for
Mrs. Yonkers. He advanced to the step of the carriage.</p>

<p>"Miss Columbia," he said, in a deep passionate
tone, "I am going on a long and perilous voyage.
To you alone, I confide the secret. Before I go, I
ask you to say in what I have offended? I love you
still, I adore you, I shall love you till death. For
your sake I have renounced all other hope. For
your sake I am a lonely, sad, and miserable man&mdash;a
monk without a cowl, a hermit of the sea and of the
land. Dear, dear, dearest Miss Columbia! one
parting word, one look of pity!"</p>

<p>But Columbia, though torn with anguish at the
beloved voice, though trembling with agitation,
remained silent, and looked another way till Mondel,
in despair, withdrew to let Mrs. Yonkers enter the
carriage. He exchanged with Amelia a look of
terrible scorn on his part, of mingled love and hate
on hers, and the carriage was whirled away.</p>

<p>On the following day the Columbia&mdash;Mondel had,
unsuspected by Robert Lax&mdash;given the national
name of his adored girl to the vessel&mdash;started on its
voyage to Havana.</p>

<p>But Mondel had made his preparations and laid in
his stores, and it was not long before he announced,
as if opening sealed orders, to his crew, what a very
different destination he had in view.</p>

<p>But of the ship and those in it and their adventures
we shall ere long have occasion to speak.</p>

<p>For the present, let us revert to the living Columbia
and her destinies.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV.</p>

<p>THE FAREWELL PRESENT.</p>

</div>

<p>THE very day after Mondel's departure&mdash;as was
generally supposed for Cuba&mdash;in reality for the
golden island of the Pacific&mdash;a lady called upon
Columbia, and delivered into her hands a sealed
packet.</p>

<p>That lady was Mrs. Normer.</p>

<p>"From whom is this packet, madam?" said
Columbia.</p>

<p>"From Mr. Mondel. He requested me to give it
to you, and to no other, myself, as he might possibly
never return to the United States."</p>

<p>"You knew Mr. Mondel well?"</p>

<p>"Intimately."</p>

<p>"And his wife? did you ever see Mrs. Mondel?"</p>

<p>"Never, and for the best of all possible reasons,
he never was married."</p>

<p>"Not married and divorced?"</p>

<p>"Never married, therefore most certainly never
divorced. Ah, my dear young lady, excuse me for
saying it, you do not know what you have lost."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, madam?"</p>

<p>"I mean that no woman was ever loved with a
deeper and truer devotion than were you by Dudley
Mondel. He is the proudest man I ever knew, yet
he wept like a child when he gave me this packet
to give to you."</p>

<p>"Favor me, madam, with your name and address,"
said Columbia, trembling with agitation, "I will do
myself the pleasure of calling upon you."</p>

<p>"I shall be happy to see you at any time," said
Mrs. Normer, with a look of pity and penetration.
"Good day."</p>

<p>"Good day, madam."</p>

<p>Columbia hastened to her own room. She tore
open the packet. It contained Mondel's Memoirs,
and a letter written in an almost illegible hand, in
which, with the utmost consideration for Mrs. Yonkers,
he explained to Columbia his exact position
with respect to her step-mother:</p>

<p>"She is innocent" he said, "of all blame. The caprices of passion
are the fiats of destiny. When I think how, at length, I despised her,
how I hated her, when one night she unexpectedly kissed me at parting,
at the very door of your house, I shudder to imagine that, perhaps,
<i>your</i> feelings towards myself are equally contradictory. But a
secret instinct tells me, that this woman has been the cause of your
hatred for me. It may be an act of meanness, it may show want of
generosity, but in the abyss of my own misery, I feel no pity for a
woman who could show so little pride as first to wed a man she did
not love, for self-interest, and then to torment a man who could not
love her. But I forget my fatalism. All now is at an end. I go, and
many, many long months must elapse before my return. Yet, if you
<i>could</i> relent, if there <i>were</i> a possibility of clearing up some horrible
mystery which has overshadowed and darkened our lives, bear in
mind that I, at least, am fixed and immutable in my faith, and that
that faith, whilst Dudley Mondel breathes and lives is, and can only
be&mdash;Columbia.</p>

<p>"In you," continued Mondel in his letter "I have at length
beheld the visioned queen of my most exaggerated dreams of beauty
and intelligence. I wish you to know me as I am and have been,
not as a mere fragment of a life. We live, O beautiful and enlightened
Columbia, in a world of cant. We are indoctrinated from our
cradles with absurd prejudices, the result of ages of ignorance. We
are taught to call one thing virtue, and another vice, to trust utterly
to the teachings from without, and to silence ever the voices from
within. The highest source of happiness, LOVE, is surrounded by
restrictions, calculated to engender baseness and crime. The commonest
necessities of existence are rendered unattainable to vast
multitudes of mankind. Our sympathies are narrowed by selfish
fears, our intellects cramped by pompous repetitions of antique
fallacies. Our whole lives are poisoned by conventional delusions!</p>

<p>"Against this world and its civilization, I am, and have been,
a rebel. In the accompanying memoirs I have spoken, like Jean
Jacques Rousseau, what I believed to be the language of absolute
truth, without false modesty on the one hand or false shame on the
other.</p>

<p>"Read, fair Columbia, and learn to know the man who had the
presumption to offer you his love. Yours till death,</p>

<p>"MONDEL."</p>

<p>With fingers actually quivering with emotion, the
blonde poetess, having first bolted her door, to prevent
Mrs. Yonkers from surprising her, pushed back the
damp silken hair that clung to her white temples, and
commenced the perusal of a manuscript which bore
for a heading the ominous title:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p>A SLAVE OF THE LAMP.</p>

<p>But it was no Arabian Night's Entertainment, no
story of Aladdin and his genii, which awaited her
perusal.</p>

<p>Reader, we have had short chapters lately; prepare

<p id="c25">CHAPTER XXV.</p>

<p>MEMOIRS OF DUDLEY MONDEL'S YOUTH.</p>

<p>I.</p>

</div>

<p>MY history is of all histories the saddest. It is the
history of the soul wrestling with Destiny.</p>

<p>I may die crowned with the wreath of victory, but the
wreath of victory is also the wreath of martyrdom.
I have lived, and suffered.</p>

<p>I have been pre&euml;minently a reasonable and reasoning
being, yet have apparently committed the
greatest follies.</p>

<p>I have been so scrupulously moral that I have even
been accused of crimes.</p>

<p>By morality I understand acting in harmony with
Nature's truth, and the soul's highest conceptions of
life!</p>

<p>I have been a refined voluptuary, yet my cravings
for enjoyment have been frustrated and counteracted.</p>

<p>Seemingly predestined by my physical organization
to be a man of action, I have been for the most part
constrained to live the life of a student. My existence
has been a tormenting contradiction. Filled
with a superabundance of vitality, I have sat face to
face with death during the best years of life.</p>

<p>A natural orator, and even an improvisatore, I
have brooded in almost unbroken silence. A born
philosopher and statesman, I have scarcely attracted
attention except as a poet and a humorist. Abounding
in social sympathies, I have lived for years
together in solitude and retirement.</p>

<p>In vain have I, from time to time, striven by a
desperate effort, to burst the iron chain which bound
me to the pen.</p>

<p>I have been offered military commands, I have
been placed at the head of a commercial enterprise.
I have been made editor of journals, elected grand
master of political societies, and I have, at various
periods, studied no less than three regular professions.</p>

<p>But the world was against me. The voice of
tyrant Fates murmured imperiously&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Think, and when weary of thinking, write!
Write, and when weary of writing, think!</i>"</p>

<p>Walls&mdash;nay ramparts of books seemed to grow up
around me, hem me in, and imprison me. Like a
huge rat in a cage, I gnawed myself a breach, by
devouring all before me, and lo! new ramparts arose,
and the task was still to be recommenced. So I
wrote and read, and read and wrote, till I became in
the bloom of youth a man without an age. I had
analyzed all things, and there remained nothing&mdash;nothing
but primitive elements&mdash;the elements of a
skepticism dark and all-embracing, in the shadow of
which the pride and power and aims of men withered
and became colorless. For to me all things were
alike. A dismal sameness overspread the world of
mortals. I knew too much, and felt too little to share
their illusions, though, alas! illusions are but illusions
when we recognize them to be so. The soul gives
its hue to nature, and the reaction of mine became
a neutral tint&mdash;a sad color not far removed from that
"darkness visible," which the Inferno of Milton
rejoiced in.</p>

<p>I was the last man of the old world with a great
purpose and a great heart; and the old world could
not comprehend me.</p>

<p>Possibly it was fortunate that a link also bound me
to the new world.</p>

<p>Old England is dead. Its supremacy is a legend
of the past. Ere long it will be no more to America
than was Troy of old to Rome. It is a grand fable
that of the gods who dethrone their fathers.
Such gods are the genii of nations. Old age brings decay,
and vigorous youth springs up to manhood and
empire. Britannia is a decrepit hag&mdash;a step-mother
who starves her children. What more can I say?</p>

<p>Regard the modern poets of England!</p>

<p>Let their feeble versicles serve to demonstrate the
justice of my disdain. Life is a riddle to them, heroism
a forgotten dream, invention&mdash;unknown, beauty
the ornamental. Sublimity, egotistic bombast;
art, a caprice, love a mixture of vanity and sensualism!&mdash;in
a word, they are weak, they are ridiculous!</p>

<p>They have neither the personal greatness, the loftiness
of idea, nor the executive power of true poets.</p>

<p>Their verses limp. They resort to poetical licenses,
to antiquated words, to the forced pronunciations of
words ending in <i>ed</i>, and I know not what paltry puerilities,
imitated, indeed, from the great old masters,
but no longer justified by the advanced state of the
noble and marvellously combined language of our
supreme Scandinavian race.</p>

<p>But why call them poets&mdash;that is <i>creators?</i>
They wrote nothing. Shakspere created a world of living
characters, as did Homer before him. &AElig;schylus,
Dante, Milton, Goethe, Byron, Lamartine, impressed
the world with the intense grandeur of their intelligence
and god-like personalities.</p>

<p>What have Tennyson and his sequent lotus-eaters
accomplished?</p>

<p>Nothing, literally nothing! their words are like
the summer's breeze that leaves no trace of its passage.
To seek enjoyment in their pages is to smoke
light cigars, not to quaff the nectar of the gods; it
is literally to kill time. They have founded a school,
they have not created an image.</p>

<p>If England <i>have</i> a poet, he is Charles Dickens.
<i>He</i> has created forms and fancies that will live, and
he alone of his generation.</p>

<p>But the glorious majesty of harmonious numbers
is wanting. The measured cadence of his easy prose
but ill supplies the magic of the lyre. It is Shakspere
without his laurels, Homer without his gods.
England can never again produce a real poet. A
nation of paupers can no longer respond to the celestial
vibrations of enthusiasm, of national sympathy,
or national glory. It is in America that the poet
must arise and sing such songs as never yet were
sung&mdash;the songs of hope and enterprise.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

</div>

<p>Long before I was born, a profound philosopher
might have predicted the stormy destiny prepared
for me.</p>

<p>My father and mother were eminently unsuited to
one another in disposition. The theory of contrasts
harmonizing in marriage is an insane delusion. My
father and mother were as opposite in nature as two
people could well be, and yet find any points of
harmony.</p>

<p>My father was dark, haughty, vain, irascible, and
though capable of liberality, naturally selfish and
sensual. He was tall, handsome and agreeable, even
cordial in manner. His mind was strong in will, but
limited in grasp. His intellect was practical, but
not expansive, tenacious without being absorbent.
Brought up in English High Church and Ultra-Tory
principles, he was a bigot in religion and a partisan
in politics. His great talisman was obedience, discipline,
order. His whole moral strength lay in his
exactness.  His sense of justice was comparatively
strong, his benevolence limited by his caution and
suspicion. He ought to have entered the army.
He would have made an admirable colonel of
cavalry, if not a great general. He had no physical
fear so far as I could ever observe. His moral, at
least his intellectual, timidity was excessive. He was
easily imposed on by the assumption of a man his
superior in one particular branch of knowledge.
His amatory affections were powerful, but he was a
natural tyrant, and required in a wife a submissive
inferior, not an equal companion.</p>

<p>It was his misfortune to marry a woman immeasurably
his superior in intelligence.</p>

<p>My mother was a fair beauty, tall, delicate, blue-eyed,
gentle, and imaginative. She had a far
greater talent for painting than my father, who also
cultivated the arts; she wrote poetry, whilst my
father could scarcely compass metre. She had been
accustomed, at * * House, her father's (the
American Minister's) residence in London, to meet
many of the most illustrious men of the age, including
most of the famous writers and artists of the past
generation. Sir W. S., the great Sir W.&mdash;&mdash;! was
her friend, and with his own hand inscribed her
name in many of his books. H&mdash;&mdash;n, the unfortunate
H&mdash;&mdash;n, was her drawing-master. The present
Sir E. L. was a constant visiter at the <i>House</i>. There,
too, she saw Spurzheim, the famous phrenologist,
Theodore Hook, the wit, and numerous other celebrities,
now for the most part vanished from this earth's
surface.</p>

<p>Her father was opposed to the marriage. As a
philosopher and an accomplished man of the world,
he probably foresaw the inevitable discord which
must spring up sooner or later between two such
characters. He even left town to avoid being present
at the marriage, though he would not oppose his
daughter's wishes. They were married. I have
heard my father say that they exchanged impatient
words in the very post-chaise which, according to
established precedent, whirled them away to the
retirement of the honeymoon.</p>

<p>Storms soon lowered.</p>

<p>The young couple differed in religion. My father
was a bigoted churchman, my mother a free-thinker
and republican, like <i>her</i> father. Still, I fancy, they
tried their best to agree. But it is an old saying,
that fire and water will not mingle. My parents
were on the verge of separation before they had been
married many years, whilst I was a mere baby.
However, friends of the family interfered, and
effected a reconciliation, and&mdash;things went on as discordantly
as ever.</p>

<p>Why is the world so stupid as not to see that the
moment a married couple cease to be happy, should
be the moment of their separation? Why is marriage,
which should be a union for the noblest
delights, converted into an ignoble slavery and
punishment!</p>

<p>To throw any obstacles, even the slightest, in the
way of divorce by mutual consent, is a monstrous
absurdity. Marriage should cordially be a simple
contract between two parties. To make it more is
an invention of fiendlike cruelty. Reason, where
divested of religious prejudice, must recognize the
same absolute freedom in relation of the sexes, as in
those of commerce or friendship. There is but one
law that should ever bind two human beings together&mdash;the
law of love. To apply brute force (that is
legal restraint or penalty) to the regulation of the
spontaneous passions of our nature, is a miserable
remnant of barbarism.</p>

<p>Let those who love be united, let those who hate
be parted. All other systems are the insanities of
diseased minds, superstitions of an ignorant age past.</p>

<p>Imagine two young married couples, equally ill
assorted and wretched, placed upon an island, discovering
that by a simple exchange of partners, they
can convert a social hell into a paradise. What are
they to do? Endure the torments of love on the one
hand, and disgust on the other, in conformity with
the laws of Man, or embrace happiness and a new
life in conformity with the laws of Nature?</p>

<p>My earliest recollections are of frolicking with my
little sister, a beautiful fairy-like child, in a large
drawing-room, whilst my mother played a series of
pieces on the piano. The intoxication of music&mdash;the
only intoxication, save that of love, which, in my opinion,
is worthy of a poet&mdash;filled my mind with
the wildest fancies and illusions. Never, never shall I
forget my mother's sweet soft voice, and clear intelligible
expression, when she conversed by the hour
with her children&mdash;her only companions. Although
neglected and abandoned by her husband, she never
breathed to us a syllable concerning our father, save
of love and duty. Her imagination was vivid, her
appreciation of genius intense, but her life was a
desert. The society she would have enjoyed was
driven by my father's strange eccentricity and vain
pride from their house. He unconsciously loved the
society of inferiors, and was captivated by the adulation
and flattery of parasites, paid rather to his wealth
than to his talent. The death of his father, in my
seventh year, had left him rich and independent;
though I have always suspected that he diminished
his fortune by vast speculations in stocks, or possibly
by downright gambling. He was very secretive, and
even in after years, vague in his confidences. To this
day I know little of the history of his affairs.</p>

<p>I was born on the sea, during the return of my
father and mother from America, which they visited
shortly after their marriage.</p>

<p>My childish life was passed in a sort of dream.
From the plays I saw at the theatres, and the books,
which at an unusually early age, I devoured with a
burning avidity, I constructed within my soul an
imaginary world of knights, enchanters, kings, princesses,
ghosts, demons, bandits, and wild beasts;
dragons, griffins, and chimeras. In this fantasmal
world, my little sister and myself passed our lives.
We acted a never-ending succession of improviso-dramas,
robing ourselves fantastically in colored
shawls and draperies, fighting feigned battles with
wooden swords and spears, and utterly indifferent to
the commonplace lives and games of other children
whom we visited, or who visited at our house.</p>

<p>This exaggeration of the imaginative faculty at
one time began to take in me the form of mental
disease, and in broad daylight hideous spectres
began to appear to me with all the distinctness of
actual forms. An insane horror of darkness, and of
the invisible world of mystery, possessed me to such
a degree, that I wonder I did not die in some of the
agonies of fear which I endured. It seems to me
that I thus exhausted all my power of feeling
terror, for, in after life, I observed in myself an indifference
to physical danger, and even to death itself,
which I have never seen so coldly and completely
developed in any other man. I have often laughed
in after years at the trouble people have taken to
impress me with the idea of some personal peril. To
risk my life in a chance has become with me a habit.
I am a sort of fatalist; I feel that when a man's hour
comes, it comes. Life is but a page in the book of
time, death but turning over a new leaf in the diary
of eternity.</p>

<p>My recollections of actual events in my early childhood
are somewhat obscure. A few brighter points
start up here and there. I remember a visit, when I
was, perhaps, five or six years of age, to my grandfather's
country-seat, Lakeland House. There was a
lake of some twenty acres on the estate, and boats
upon it; and seven little islands, which were named
after my aunts and uncles. The house was modern,
and the most attractive objects in it, to me, were the
skins of some badgers, bears and foxes, which served
as mats and which I coveted hugely. A quantity of
Indian weapons, which an adventurous uncle had
brought back from the South Seas, were also objects
of interest, as were two suits of armor and a great
cross-handled sword, with which I had a confused
notion that my grandfather had fought under Richard
C&oelig;ur-de-Lion, in the third crusade. At that time
my notions of dates were confused, and I had been
reading Sir Walter Scott's Talisman with the
perfect faith of childhood, so much so, that I dreamed of
being Ivanhoe and fighting Bois du Guilbert nightly.</p>

<p>It seems to me, that at that time, my grandfather
was always talking about his plantations and improvements,
and driving people about in a poney-chaise to
admire his doings. I remember also, having a confused
notion that some day or other I was to be
created Lord Lakeland, and become a tremendously
rich and important man. Dimly so, methinks, I once
heard my excellent grandmother impressively say to
her daughter&mdash;</p>

<p>"Make the dear boy a clergyman."</p>

<p>And I, in utter disdain of that, in England, most
respectable and aristocratic profession, ran up to my
mother and growled petulantly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I won't be a parson, ma', I'll be a soldier. I won't
wear a long gown like a woman, I hate it, I do."</p>

<p>"Hush! hush! you naughty boy!" said my grandmother,
indulgently.</p>

<p>But they could not make a parson of <i>me</i>, I felt
sure of that, so they might talk till they were tired.
I should be a soldier, or more probably a knight
errant&mdash;like Don Quixote, that glorious hero of La
Mancha, whose acquaintance I was just beginning to
make in a splendid illustrated edition in the library.</p>

<p>Of all books which I ever read, Homer's Iliad, in
Pope's translation, made the greatest and most
deeply enduring impression on my mind. I read it
at eight years of age, in an old large printed edition,
strongly bound in worn calf, with plenty of gilding,
red marble edges, and engravings which, to me, at
the time, were marvels of art.</p>

<p>I remember my father tearing out the picture
which represented Mars and Venus under the net of
Vulcan in a state of considerable <i>d&eacute;shabill&eacute;</i>. I presume
now that he thought it might suggest evil
thoughts to my youthful mind. Then I simply
regretted any damage to my dear, dear book. Oh,
how I read that Iliad! I knew the names of all
the Greek and Trojan warriors, even to the third-rate
fellows who were barely worth the killing; Achilles,
Petrocles, Agamemnon, Ajax, Ulysses, Menelaus,
Tydides, Hector, &AElig;neas, Sarpedon, Paris, were all to
me as real, nay, much <i>more</i> real than Mr. This or
That, who actually were visitors at the house.</p>

<p>If there was one thing I theoretically delighted in,
it was fighting.</p>

<p>I formed in my mind a sort of thermometer of the
valor and prowess of the Greek and Trojan leaders,
and got up, in the arena of my martial fancy, a
series of imaginary single combats between warriors
who, in the Iliad itself, never had an opportunity of
measuring their strength. I cannot say how much I
was puzzled by the consideration of the possible
result of a "regular set-to" between &AElig;neas and
Ulysses, or Hector and the King of men.</p>

<p>This love of Homer and his heroes, which has
never abated, caused me, even when I read Shakspere's
plays, a year or two later, to prefer Troilus
and Cressida to any other, on account of what Lamb
calls "the old familiar faces." Indeed, the Greek
and Roman education of boys in England of the
higher ranks, predisposes them to prefer classical
scenery and characters in their first introduction to
the second great poet of the world.</p>

<p>I say the second great poet&mdash;for of this rest
assured, between Homer and Shakspere there is a
parallel to be drawn. Otherwise each stands unapproachable
on his pedestal. All other comparisons
are feeble.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when, immediately after my rush
into Shakspere, I received a complete set of Milton's
poetical works as a present from my father, I shall
not easily forget the devouring rapture with which I
read the Paradise Lost, amazed at my own wickedness
for taking so intense an interest in Satan. But
who can help wishing the rebel Archangel success
in his stupendously audacious enterprise&mdash;the first
grand fillibustero adventure on record! I prayed
God to forgive me, but I really could not avoid feeling
that Milton's hero was the Devil, and his God a
tyrant.</p>

<p>I had not then read the mighty <i>Prometheus</i> of
&AElig;schylus, on which the Satan is modelled. I did
not know that Milton was the secretary of Cromwell,
and Satan the embodied spirit of liberty. Even
now it puzzles me to know whether Milton <i>intended</i>
the world to sympathize so strongly with his Rebel
God of Evil as the magic of his poetry necessitates.</p>

<p>Was Milton a free-thinker at bottom?</p>

<p>Can genius and superstition live side by side? In
form perhaps, in essence never.</p>

<p>Thus from the fountains of the highest and purest
genius, my soul was nourished in despite of the dull
formal routine to which I was subjected under the
pretence of education. My schoolmasters at first
mistook me for a dunce, or, at best, a boy of disordered
mind.</p>

<p>Sometimes I fell into reverie, and forgot my lesson,
then made a desperate effort to learn in ten minutes
the task of an hour. For this I was reprimanded and
punished. Little did they understand that my spirit
had returned from a voyage to another world&mdash;returned
to the consciousness of human stupidity and
tyranny.</p>

<p>Why is it that schoolmasters so rarely understand
human nature?</p>

<p>It is because this important and most noble occupation
is still not appreciated socially at its true value.
It is because, to keep school is a desperate resource,
not a field of honorable ambition. Yet it is in the
education of the young, that men of letters ought to
find that ease and emolument which their irregular
profession too often denies them. But the teacher
must not be the corrector, nor should domestic cares
form part of his charge.</p>

<p>My first success at school was a fine illustration of
the attractive theory of Fourier.</p>

<p>Our mathematical master Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;, adopted the
plan of proposing to his juvenile class, a series of
arithmetical problems, to be solved mentally, without
the use of slate or pencil. I was then in my eighth
year. The novelty of the thing interested me, and
awakened my intellectual energies. I proved quite a
"calculating boy" (in after life, <i>calculation</i> has not
been supposed to be my forte by my wise relatives
and friends); I multiplied twenty-three and three
quarters, by sixteen and a half, with a rapidity and
facility that astonished my teacher.</p>

<p>"How do you do it?" said Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do it on a slate!"</p>

<p>"On a slate? But no slate is allowed, and you
have none before you."</p>

<p>"I fancy a slate, sir, and I fancy the figures; I
see them in my mind."</p>

<p>From that moment Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;regarded me with
interest. In the holidays my father engaged him as
my private tutor. But this was an outrage I resented
most indignantly; as did also my little sister. We
would <i>not</i> work during holidays, and our childish
wills were like the "laws of the Medes and Persians,
which altered not," only a shade more obstinate. So
we learned nothing, and poor Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;resigned
himself to our tricks and his emoluments. But like
a good fellow, he told no tales out of school. It was
lucky for us he did <i>not</i>, since we had a father who did
not comprehend insubordination.</p>

<p>My little sister, two years younger than I, was a
most beautiful child, with light hair, blue eyes, and
the most delicate complexion in the world. We
loved one another dearly. We told one another all
our thoughts and fancies, with the exception, in my
case, of my fantastic love-dreams, which were too
mysteriously inexplicable to myself for me to make
them a theme of conversation. Of these I shall soon
have occasion to speak.</p>

<p>I may mention here, as one of the misfortunes of
my life, that although the most perfect sympathy
existed between my sister and myself at all times, we
have been almost constantly separated since our childhood,
by the force of circumstances, and my own
wandering adventures. Thus I have been for the
most part deprived of one of the greatest possible
sources of consolation in adversity&mdash;the pure unselfish
affection of one of the noblest and most enlightened
women of the age.</p>

<p>But I must not linger too long over the dreamy
recollections of childhood, or I shall never come to
the events which, alone, can give any original interest
to these hasty records of my life.</p>

<p>I was nearly eleven years of age, when my father
and mother actually separated. My father seized her
letters; he said she had carried on a correspondence
with a gentleman who frequented the house. He
himself, undoubtedly, kept a mistress at the time.
Nothing could equal the bitterness with which he
poisoned my mind against her. He was all noble
indignation and generous forbearance! Alas! before
the suit which she commenced against him in the
Ecclesiastical Court, could be brought to a conclusion,
she died of a broken heart, and I became the lonely
and peculiar child, of which I shall now have occasion
to speak.</p>

<p>We children were, immediately on the open rupture
taking place between our parents, hurriedly
dressed, and thrust into a carriage at the door, without
even bidding farewell to our unfortunate mother.
We  were  conveyed to the house of my father's private
physician, and, subsequently, sent to schools
where she could not find us out. I saw my mother
but once again. It was during the holidays; my
sister, her governess and I, were returning from a
drive. As the carriage approached the gates of the
country-house in which we lived, the tall form of a
lady in black, with a black lace veil, appeared
before the threshold.</p>

<p>It was my mother!</p>

<p>Filled with the hideous impressions produced by
my father's revolting insinuations against her, I felt&mdash;shall
I confess the horror!&mdash;a strange apprehension
of that sad victim of an ill-judged marriage. I leapt
from the carriage, and would have rushed before it
through the open gates, had not my mother, whose
eyes were red with weeping, clasped me in her arms,
and kissing me passionately, exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"What! have they taught you to fear me?"</p>

<p>"No, no, mamma, I love you; indeed I love you!"
was my sobbing answer.</p>

<p>Then I heard her voice speaking to the governess,
in almost inarticulate accents, begging her to be kind
to her children.</p>

<p>Then she fainted&mdash;yes, reader, my mother fainted
on the threshold of my father's house, and his
servants did not dare to carry her into the house to
restore her!</p>

<p>Was it not in <i>that</i> house, that, accompanied by
witnesses, she surprised him in the very arms of his
paramour?</p>

<p>When she was restored, she re-entered the carriage,
which awaited her hard-by, and the poor
governess, with eyes full of tears, stammered vaguely
words of consolation to my grief.</p>

<p>Poor, dear Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash;, she was a good woman,
and a true lady. She had been formerly governess
to Lord M&mdash;&mdash;'s children, the grandchildren of the
King. It was to her evidence, as to the truth of my
representations that I owed at a later period the offer
of a commission in the British army, from the late
commander-in-chief himself. I could not accept the
commission; but I well recollect at the time, the
admirable effect produced on my worthy landlady,
by the arrival of the long official letter with "<i>on her
majesty's service</i>," printed so conspicuously on the
cover. I believe it was worth three months' additional
credit to me, at the least. But I anticipate events.</p>

<p>I was twelve years of age. I had been sent to a
new boarding-school, about ten miles from London.</p>

<p>In this house it was, that Dean Swift, the renowned
satirist, ate the bread of bitterness, as private secretary
of the famous minister, Sir William Temple.</p>

<p>It was in Swift's little study, that I wrote my first
boyish satire, "The Bengal Tiger," wherein I lashed
with a "whip of scorpions" a little boy, son of an
Indian Major, who had indulged the carnivorous
extravagance of taking a mouthful of a schoolfellow's
shoulder.</p>

<p>Byron's English Bards and Scotch Reviewers was
not more successful in the great world, than was
the "Bengal Tiger" at Temple Grove. I "awoke
and found myself famous."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>II.</p>

</div>

<p>At that time the measles had run through the
school, and though convalescent, a large party of us
were living in happy idleness. Not being able to go
out, and released from scholastic torture, we devoted
ourselves to literature.</p>

<p><i>Pickwick</i> had just electrified the world. The star
of Boz had risen like a superb comet with a most
extraordinarily fine tale. I awoke one morning (not
on the morning in which I found myself famous, but
a day or two before that occurrence), and saw all the
boys in the room reading PICKWICK.</p>

<p>"Hollo, whose books are those?" cried I, gazing
covetously at the bright green-covered numbers.</p>

<p>"Why, <i>yours</i>," said one of the boys.</p>

<p>"Mine?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yours of course; I suppose your governor
sent them for you; <i>we</i> found them on the mantelpiece
wrapped loosely in that piece of brown paper, and
so took a look at them."</p>

<p>From that day a Pickwickian element was mingled
with our conversations. We were all Sam Wellers,
or rather, <i>V</i>ellers, for we did not forget Mr. Weller
senior's, solemn injunction. "Spell it with a <i>we</i> Sammivel,
spell it with a <i>we!</i>"</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, a comic poet arrived
at the right time, and there was a <i>furore</i> in favor
of the <i>Bengal Tiger</i>.</p>

<p>Like Uncle Tom, the Bengal Tiger originally owed
its immense success to the happy selection of the subject
and its advocacy of a <i>great principle</i>. English
boys, especially the "sons of gentlemen," are severe
advocates of <i>fair-fighting</i>.  In fact, they have very
rigid ideas of the conduct of the duelleo or single
combat.</p>

<p>In a battle with fists, it is lawful to <i>hit</i> anyhow
and any where <i>above the waist</i>, but the boy who
<i>scratches or bites</i>, is utterly disgraced in the eyes of
this youthful chivalry.*</p>

<p>[*A lingering remnant of the educational prejudice would, I admit, even now
enable me to shoot a man who talked of <i>gouging</i>, not as a remedial, only, but even
as a preventive measure, without any scruples of conscience. I should certainly
propose, on all occasions, to administer Lynch law to the degraded ruffians who
indulge in such fiendlike and revolting atrocities.]</p>

<p>The <i>Bengal Tiger</i>, besides being the "funniest
poem ever written" (I quote a Review started for
the express purpose of criticising the "<i>Tiger</i>") was
an indignant denunciation of all unfair fighting,
which it stigmatized as altogether unworthy of
gentlemen and only fit for wild Irishmen and cannibals.</p>

<p>Hence its unbounded popularity.</p>

<p>Hence half a dozen spurious imitations, which
vainly strove to rival the "real original Tiger."</p>

<p>In fact no less than six <i>Bengal Tigers</i> were in the
field and, be it noted, in every one of them <i>tiger</i>
rhymed to <i>Niger</i>, according to the arrangement of
the first verse of the original masterpiece, which ran
thus:&mdash;

<p>"You've heard of crocodiles that fill<br/>

The seven-mouthed Nile and Niger,<br/>

You've heard of wondrous Jack and Jill,<br/>

But not the Bengal tiger!"</p>

<p>But like the numberless apocryphal gospels which
were discarded in the early centuries of Christianity,
the spurious tigers disappeared, as rapidly and surely
from view as that renowned animal of the same
breed, who, in the magniloquent phrase of the world-famed
<i>Peter Parley</i>, on some occasion had the
remarkable indiscretion to "plunge like a thunderbolt
into the very jaws of the crocodile."</p>

<p>Probably this sublime passage (vide illustration)
suggested my own opening stanza. If so, I render
unto C&aelig;sar the things that are C&aelig;sar's, and to Parley
the things which are Parley's&mdash;which is more than
the booksellers and their miserable hacks have done
to that ingenious writer.</p>

<p>A word here for Peter! His <i>natural history</i> is the
most charming book of the kind, for the young, ever
produced. Its frontispiece with the comparative
sizes of the animals is an admirable idea. Its style
and method are delightful. I read it over so often
when a child that even at this moment I can recite
passages from its pages <i>verbatim</i>.</p>

<p>His son walks in his footsteps, and the letters of
"Dick Tinto" from Paris,* are the best correspondence
letters in the world.</p>

<p>[*Published in the <i>Daily Times</i>.]</p>

<p>The success of the "Tiger" prompted me to more
ambitious efforts, and I translated one of the most
famous odes of Horace into English verse so much to
the satisfaction of the head master of the academy,
that he encouraged me to go on, and resolved, if I
succeeded as well with the rest, to publish the work
as a specimen of what boys at twelve years of age were
in the habit of doing under his tuition. But I
was like the bird that sings when he pleases, and so
Horace was left to his fate and to the pedants.
Meanwhile the wife of the master, a lady of about
five and thirty, still extremely beautiful and highly
accomplished, showed my lighter boyish productions
to her most distinguished guests, and with a woman's
instinct recognized in them a germ of that which,
perhaps, escaped her learned husband. Accordingly
<i>she</i> suggested an epic!&mdash;and "Scanderbeg the
Epirotian King," was the result, a most infernally
absurd poem in the heroic measure&mdash;a childish epic
of a hundred and fifty lines!</p>

<p>Thanked be Destiny, I was not a precocious genius,
or, as Dickens phrases it, an infant phenomenon. I
wrote as I thought and felt, but wrote <i>as a boy</i>.
My command of language was perfect, my command
of ideas limited by my years. I could not
produce those marvellous <i>parodies</i> which are so
often mistaken in the young for signs of original
power. Nothing is more fallacious. The true poet,
or inventive spirit, writes <i>himself</i>. The pseudo-genius
reproduces others. The one is a "mirror to
nature," the other a mere colored window. There
was one boy at Temple Grove who could write so
good an imitation of an Edinburgh Quarterly review
article, that Macaulay himself could not have helped
laughing at the likeness, which, as his son was at
the school, he possibly may have seen.</p>

<p>My next attempts were a series of tales in prose
and verse, ranging from "The Last of the Romans,
or the fall of Constantinople," to "Prester John,"
and "The Island of Magicians," with odes to all
the Seasons, and a love poem so universal in its aspirations,
that I quote it here from memory, as showing
what strange thoughts boys do cherish:</p>

<p>"Oh! had I but one being to share<br/>

My dreams and fears and delights and tears,<br/>

And were she passing passing fair!<br/>

With azure eyes, and amber hair;<br/>

Might she be prest,<br/>

To my fond breast!<br/>

And I, in words of flame declare<br/>

My glowing love, and she confess,<br/>

An echo&mdash;this<br/>

Were brighter bliss,<br/>

Than, save in castles in the air,<br/>

Illumes life's bleak wilderness!"</p>

<p>I still preserve the original MS. of this sentimental
production, written in a trembling round hand, as if
under slight agitation. Truly, the boy is the father
of the man!</p>

<div class="center">

<p>III.</p>

</div>

<p>Properly speaking, I have known but one passion
in my life&mdash;the love of Beauty.</p>

<p>All other sentiments have ever with me been
secondary to the one great idea. I cannot recollect
the time when this idea did not predominate in my
mind. My earliest dreams, waking and sleeping,
were of beautiful little girls, of ecstatic caresses,
and ineffable affection.</p>

<p>Being incapable of conceiving any other object in
existence than love, nearly the whole energy of my
being has been expended in the search for that ideal
beauty and sympathy, without which, I saw no hope
of happiness, no refuge from utter despair and
death.</p>

<p>Living in this dream, I have accomplished all
other acts of my life, comparatively speaking, <i>as
tasks</i>, from a sense of duty, or rather pride and self-respect.
I never cared much for praise, even when
a boy. I never felt emulation. A strangely blind
confidence in my own success, under all circumstances,
and against all rivalry, was one of the peculiarities
(perhaps diseases) of my character.</p>

<p>At the same time this pride, which sustained me,
and alone counteracted my natural tendency to fantastic
and meditative idleness, was of an almost
satanic intensity. I was a natural desperado. At an
early age I adopted as my motto under all circumstances,
the simple alternative, "<i>Victory or Death.</i>"</p>

<p>The heraldic motto of my family, "<i>Animo et Fide</i>&mdash;By
courage and by faith," was not indeed far
removed in spirit from that which I adopted.</p>

<p>To revolutionize empires, to achieve literary,
artistic or scientific supremacy; to conquer the
thousand difficulties which oppose an unbounded
ambition, appeared to me always mere matters of
calculation, perseverance and audacity. But to discover
the ideal beauty&mdash;and, having discovered her,
to gain the return for my love which my soul so
imperiously demanded, there, there indeed, was a
perilous problem for my life!</p>

<p>Even in that dilemma I fell back&mdash;I still fall back
upon my old and desperate motto&mdash;<i>Victory or
Death!</i></p>

<div class="center">

<p>IV.</p>

</div>

<p>I HAD only been some months at T&mdash;&mdash; G&mdash;&mdash;,
when one day my father came to see me. According
to established usage, I was arrayed in fresh clothes
from head to foot, and then sent to the reception-room.
My father received me with a strange,
abstracted, yet determined, air.</p>

<p>"We will walk," said he, "down the hill; I have
left the carriage at the inn."</p>

<p>He then paused, and seeming to collect himself for
an effort, said abruptly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your poor mother is dead&mdash;she died some time
ago of a fever. I sent H&mdash;&mdash; (his steward) to verify
her decease. Poor thing! her death was perhaps
fortunate both for herself and others."</p>

<p>After this appropriate moral reflection, my father
paused, and seeming to make a second effort more
violent than the first, he continued rapidly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But this was not what I more especially came to
tell you&mdash;the fact is&mdash;you may as well know it at
once&mdash;and I may as well let you know it as leave
others to talk nonsense to you&mdash;the fact is that <i>I am
married again</i>.</p>

<p>"Your mother is dead&mdash;I am married again ! ! !"</p>

<p>That was all!</p>

<p>My mind refused to receive such an idea. The
shock of the sudden and startling news made me feel
confused and stupid. I walked beside my father in
silence. He said no more till we reached the hotel,
before which stood a carriage.</p>

<p>In it sat my little sister, then ten years of age, and
a lady of about two or three-and-twenty at most,
dressed in a satin cloak, trimmed with fur. She was
pretty, but it was a coarse and vulgar beauty, even
to the eyes of a boy who had seen glimpses of good
society. She had a strange look, that look which in
after years I learned so easily to appreciate in the
fashionable kept mistresses of London, Paris, and
other European capitals. She looked out of her element.
Poor thing! she little thought what a bleak
prospect lay before her; she little dreamed that the
whole remainder of her life was to be one long battle
for admission into a society which despised her, one
long attempt to solve the insoluble problem of remedying
a defective education, and concealing a never-sleeping
fear of retribution. Had she herself been
even a model of discretion, policy and delicate tact,
she could have done nothing, wedded as she was to
a&mdash;madman.</p>

<p>Yes, reader, the secret of my father's outrageous
conduct in thus indecently marrying his mistress <i>on
the very day after my mother's  death</i>, lay <i>not</i> in the
fierce impatience of his family-character, nor indeed
in any peculiar recklessness or defiance of public
opinion, which he secretly dreaded as much as any
man I ever knew. No, it lay in the fact that in one
point he was as thoroughly insane as any patient in
Bedlam.</p>

<p>My father's madness was <i>religious</i>. This insanity
was, I believe, the primary cause of his disagreement
with my mother. As soon as I grew up, I became
aware of the fact, which was finally proved conclusively
by a proceeding on his part, so absurd and
ridiculous as to be almost incredible.</p>

<p>It happened when I was about two-and-twenty, but
I will narrate it here, to bear out the above statements
satisfactorily.</p>

<p>He took it into his head, and for years&mdash;so he told
me&mdash;meditated the design, to print the four gospels in
such a manner, that verse 1, of Matthew, should be
opposite verse 1, of Mark, Luke, and John; and so
on to the end of the shortest gospel, when the other
three continued their parallel careers, till, first two,
then one only remained, and that also finally ended
with a threefold white margin at its side.</p>

<p>Of the preposterous absurdity of this arrangement
he seemed to have no consciousness. He called the
book, of which was printed a large edition, regardless
of expense "THE PERFECT LAW OF LIBERTY," and
designed for it a frontispiece. This frontispiece represented
Jesus Christ, with his cross, as the apex of a
Gothic arch. Below him were angels blowing trumpets,
and beneath their feet the earth, bursting in twain,
disclosed a gigantic Death's head, emblem, I
suppose, of that final catastrophe expected by the
devout.</p>

<p>The parallel gospels, without parallel (for of course
the passages describing the same events, never faced
one another), were preceded by an introduction, with
a strange mixture of imaginative intelligence, and
raving lunacy, and were followed by a general chronology,
studiously adapted to the exigencies of religious
tradition.</p>

<p>In after years, when, by his own confession, he
had disinherited me, and resolved to give his whole
property to his wife, I often took up the "PERFECT
LAW OF LIBERTY," and said bitterly, "Thou art my
box of title-deeds&mdash;the will of a madman is waste
paper. I may yet live to spend in the cause of
man's rights and liberties, to relieve suffering genius
and honest worth, the wealth which insanity
devoted to publishing its own delusion and selfishness,
and in preparing costly entertainments for
parasites and fools, whilst I, the heir and hope of my
race, wandered in poverty and sorrow over the earth,
with no fortune but my courage, and no companion
but my science&mdash;a treasure and a friend of which
death alone can rob us!"</p>

<p>My father's madness, then, being religious, he took
the earliest opportunity of sanctifying, by wedlock,
a connection which, in his eyes, was a crime.</p>

<p>Men of the world may laugh at such simplicity.
For my part, I believe religious superstition to be
the greatest curse of humanity. I was myself at the
age of fourteen very near becoming a bigoted religionist.
An accident cured me. It was my custom,
at night, to read with enthusiastic devotion, portions
of the Four Gospels (selected by the Church out of
some hundreds now lost or forgotten ), supposed to be
written by the four writers above alluded to. By
this means I exalted myself into a state of intense
fanaticism, and learned to understand the true nature
of the religious sentiment, or insanity, as freethinkers
would term it.</p>

<p>Love alone offers any parallel to the force of the
religious passion. At that time I would have become
a martyr without hesitation. One night I dreamed
the whole scene of the Crucifixion with such awful
vividness, that it has never since faded or become
dim like other dreams. Especially the tall, gaunt,
mildly stern figure of Jesus is ever present to my
memory, when it reverts to the subject of his life
and mystery.</p>

<p>The accident which checked the flow of my gushing
enthusiasm for the creed of mediation, was this:
My father one night suddenly entered my bed-room,
and finding me reading the Gospels as usual, ordered
me sternly to go to bed at once, and indulge no such
eccentricities.</p>

<p>"But," said I, amazed at this harshness, "I was
reading the New Testament."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said my father "Go to bed, and
read the New Testament at a more fitting season."</p>

<p>My father had a strange dread of fire, and much
disliked any one to burn lamp or candle during the
night. Of course he himself, in his autocratic character,
was an exception to all his own laws, which,
like those of the Medes and Persians, altered not,
except when necessity left no alternative.</p>

<p>The idea that at <i>any</i> time to read the words of
God (for such I then firmly believed the Gospels to
be) could be wrong, or that any worldly considerations
could possibly be superior to the eternal salvation
of one's soul, shocked me unutterably. At one
leap I arrived at the conclusion that all professed
Christians were hypocrites, that their religion was a
mere fancy, and their belief too weak to influence
their external lives in any matter of importance. I
saw that it did not please my father to see real faith
in my heart. What he required was, that I should
accept religion from him, and as he understood it.
My stronger and more passionate intelligence at once
rejected with scorn the mere shell of religious forms,
and sought to warm itself in the rays of the living
Truth. But the blow was struck. To my intense
sensibility there was never any middle way. Before
two years had elapsed, I was what the canters term
an Infidel, that is, I began to substitute the rational
belief of the philosopher for the blind dream of the
fanatic. My study of the Gospels cured me at least
of the religious dread or "reign of terror," as I have
elsewhere called it. A silly sermon by a dull parson
could no longer alarm me with visions of hell, devils,
and damnation: I ceased to meditate on religion; the
subject became hateful to my mind; I avoided it
with care. I fell back on my visions of ideal beauty,
and began to compose new poems and tales, which
were the admiration of my schoolfellows. I could
improvise verse without an effort, and invent endless
stories at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>Often I was amazed to observe that the fictions I
thus spontaneously poured out were eagerly credited
as facts by my young auditors, and that I was
seriously regarded as the hero of the adventures
which I narrated.</p>

<p>In after years it has been the highest triumph of
my literary ambition to hear from authors of my
acquaintance, the repeated assertion of a belief in
the substantial truth of my wildest conceptions.</p>

<p>O infernal torture of Greek verbs and Latin verses!
what a discipline for the soul! Is it for good or
evil? I know not, I cannot here discuss the question.
There is a strange prejudice in favor of the old scholastic
routine of education, which never utterly dies
in the soul of one of its <i>alumni</i>.  English school-life
is a dire imprisonment, yet I do not regret its severity;
no, I would not miss from my thoughts, even
Old Harper, the sergeant who drilled us in the gun
exercise, and rapped us over the knuckles with a
ramrod! That drilling was the most unsatisfactory
process, for the reader must understand that the rusty
old flint-lock muskets (Heaven knows how much
they weighed!) were never loaded, and that the only
part of a drill we boys would have enjoyed, viz.,
"burning powder," was rigorously denied to us.</p>

<p>I must say that we were well taken care of at
T&mdash;&mdash; G&mdash;&mdash;. If we had been of glass or wax, we
could not have been more watched over and looked
after.</p>

<p>Seven ladies&mdash;emphatically so called&mdash;and they
were, in my time, a very pretty set of young women
(a sort of cross between the lady's maid and the
governess), had each the care of a certain number of
boys, their linen and their general comforts. To servants,
our royal highnesses were never to speak, on
any pretence, except at meals, when a solemn butler
waited on us with the gravity of a Turkish Moolah,
or a Gold Stick in waiting.</p>

<p>It will appear singular, and I record the fact as
curious, that one of the duties of these fair ladies,
was to wash us every morning and evening to the
waists, which they did, I must admit, in the chastest
and most gentle manner. It was also their duty to
see us undress, and go to bed, and to extinguish the
lights. When my friend L&mdash;&mdash; took his warm baths,
he told me that the youngest of these "ladies" was
ever ready with the warm towels, to perform the part
of oriental bath servant, for his lordship.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I consider on the whole, that the
morality at T&mdash;&mdash; G&mdash;&mdash; was unexceptionable.
The conversation of the boys was, as usual, of the
most libertine character. I am told that at young
ladies' boarding schools, the subjects of conversation
in the dormitories are apt to be of a romantic nature.</p>

<p>How foolishly parents and teachers act in these
matters.  As if the <i>great mystery of life</i>, could possibly
fail to be a subject of the most intense interest
to the young; as if the development of the germ
of passion, could possibly be impeded by the impracticable
attempt to disguise or misrepresent the great
truths of nature.</p>

The boys at T&mdash;&mdash; G&mdash;&mdash; belonged to the
first families in England, many of them the sons of peers,
of distinguished statesmen, even of cabinet ministers
and royal blood: all connected with the rank and
celebrity of the day. The terms were very high, and
the profits to T&mdash;&mdash;, the master, immense. Never
were juvenile aristocrats more simply or cheaply
dieted than we. A bowl of milk-and-water for breakfast,
with dry bread <i>ad libitum</i>, the same for supper,
and at dinner a plain joint, potatoes and pudding&mdash;such
was our unvarying victual.</p>

<p>I believe the cost of keeping a boy at T&mdash;&mdash; G&mdash;&mdash;
was above a hundred pounds (or $500) a year.</p>

<p>It is a question with me whether a more generous
diet would not have in most cases proved beneficial.
But, at any rate, this frugal fare was calculated to
keep down the budding passions, and leave our heads
clear for study. And how we studied!&mdash;rather say
crammed. I will give the programme of the day.</p>

<p>Up at six, dress till half-past; chapter of Bible,
and unlimited Greek grammar till half-past eight.
School-room cold, boys hungry.</p>

<p>From ten till twelve, Latin translation, Virgil,
Horace, Cicero, as the case may be. Geometry, or
some branch of mathematics, till one. A dry biscuit,
an hour's play, and dinner at two. Play till three.
<i>Greek</i> play till five; Latin verses till half-past seven!
Tea&mdash;wash&mdash;bed by nine at latest. Conversation on
the greatness of our doings at home&mdash;horses, dogs,
pretty girls, the tremendous dignity of those awful
potentates, the "governors," and sleep&mdash;fights, bolstering-matches,
marauding expeditions excepted&mdash;till
six, and the inevitable alarm-bell.</p>

<p>Drawing, dancing, fencing, riding and drilling, in
extra hours.</p>

<p>If boys <i>could</i> be educated, we <i>were</i>; for I really do
not see <i>how</i> we could have worked any harder, and
survived the operation.</p>

<p>For my part, what with a secret impression I conceived
that T&mdash;&mdash; G&mdash;&mdash; was a sort of educational
Bastile for young lords and gentlemen of refractory
dispositions, and my horror at my father's marriage,
I resolved to run away, and seek my fortune like the
heroes I had read about in that very narrow (minded)
place, the "wide, wide world."</p>

<p>David B&mdash;&mdash;, son of Sir David B&mdash;&mdash;, of E&mdash;&mdash;,
was the only boy I could induce to accompany me.
But what with me was a stern purpose, with him was
a thoughtless whim. However, we raised all the
funds we could&mdash;a hard matter&mdash;for a lady banker
was made the depository of all our cash, and in this
truly phalansterian establishment, there was a store on
the premises at which bats, balls, and other "notions"
were handed to us on payment by <i>check</i> being tendered.
However, we collected all the smuggled specie,
which was readily given up to us as it was useless
in the pockets of its owners, who had absolutely
no means of communication with the external world.</p>

<p>An hour or two before the bell rang, one morning,
we made a start. Our plan was simple and romantic.
We would make our way to the sea-coast, take
up our lodging in a cave in the cliffs, and watch an
opportunity to join a band of smugglers! Meantime,
if our funds ran out, we could sell our gold watches
and chains, or, finally eat lobsters, crabs and oysters,
which we could get for the catching on the seashore.</p>

<p>We ourselves were however caught within a couple
of hours, on the top of the London coach, notwithstanding
that, like the villains in the melodramas, we
affected to <i>disguise</i> ourselves by sticking up our collars,
and slouching our caps over our eyes. Old
A&mdash;&mdash;, the mathematical master, stopped the coach,
and though I jumped down, had all the money about
me, and could have out-run the fat little man with
ease, I did not care for a lonely escapade, and surrendered
myself prisoner of war, and was led home
captive along with poor David, who, like King David
of old, raised up his voice and wept. I am sorry to
say, that I only swore. But that was mentally; externally,
I preserved the stoicism of an Indian prisoner.</p>

<p>The utmost consternation prevailed at T&mdash;&mdash;
G&mdash;&mdash; on our flight being detected. Messengers
were dispatched in all directions. T&mdash;&mdash; himself went
off to my father's house in London; the boys
were in ecstasies. When we returned as culprits, in
our sombre despair and terror of the coming judgment,
we distributed recklessly whole pockets full
of candy, and were heroes and persecuted patriots
ranking with Harmodius and Aristogeiton in the eyes
of our companions.</p>

<p>We were soon martyrs.</p>

<p>And here a word. If there be one contemptible,
unmanly, cowardly act in the world, it is <i>flogging a
school-boy</i>&mdash;a weak, helpless, imperfectly responsible
being, who does wrong because he is ignorant or
weak, a delicate plant which, physically and morally,
is eternally influenced by every moment of suffering
which it endures&mdash;a creature to be guided by
love and wisdom, and dignity, inspiring respect; not
to be bullied, menaced, cowed, spirit broken, and
frightened. Know this, modern Solomons&mdash;three
thousand years behind the age! there is no surer way
to breed fools and cowards than by flogging.</p>

<p>When M&mdash;&mdash; W&mdash;&mdash;shot the schoolmaster, I for
one, acquitted him from the depths of my heart.</p>

<p>Had I a son, and any living pedagogue dared to
put him to the torture, he should either beg the child's
pardon on his knees, or die the death of a scoundrel
and a coward! Like Thomas Carlyle, I have no
pity for scoundrels&mdash;at least, not when they cross
my path. A rattlesnake cannot help being a rattlesnake;
nevertheless, I feel no scruple in giving his
soul a lift on the great staircase of spiritual progress.</p>

<p><i>We</i> were flogged&mdash;half a dozen ushers were ready
to overpower all resistance.</p>

<p>Mark the result. I meditated <i>murder</i>, at the age
of twelve years! For long years the insult rankled
in my heart, and passing visions of inflicting awful
justice on poor T&mdash;&mdash; returned again and again.
Yet, this man was merely part of a vicious system,
and in his miserable ignorance of everything but
pedantic lore, and every-day worldly maxims and
prejudices, he would be now, in my eyes, were I to
meet him, as much morally a <i>child</i> compared to his
future pupil, as was I then, physically compared
to himself.</p>

<p>What a mystery is the philosophy of the passions!</p>

<p>To <i>revenge</i> is natural; to <i>cherish</i> revenge is diabolical.</p>

<p>How strange would it seem to me, were I to meet
this man again&mdash;he, almost in second childhood; I,
in the early prime of manhood, capable perhaps, of
striking him dead at a blow; our positions utterly
reversed, our very intellectual relations totally subverted!
Could I recall with bitterness his by-gone
folly? No; I should only see before me, an old man
who, to the best of his feeble ability, labored to form
my mind for the battle of life, to impart to me the
stores of learning, which he himself had accumulated
with such vast and patient labor, and who after all
gave me credit for all the good he could see in me,
and meant to do his duty, so far as his own self-interest
would let him.</p>

<p>But, <i>at the time</i>, the effect of that flogging was to
demonize me.</p>

<p>Up to that time, I was almost girlish in my gentleness
and delicacy of feeling. A harsh word or look,
would bring tears into my eyes. The ordinary cruelties
of boys to animals and one another were, to me,
revolting even to think of. My confidence in my
fellows was unbounded; to deceive me was so easy,
that the boys amused themselves with hoaxing me in
the most ridiculous ways.</p>

<p>From the moment of receiving that flogging,
strange suspicions entered my mind. Its virgin innocence
and goodness were darkened by Doubt's poisonous
fumes; I looked round on my comrades in the
pure consciousness of wishing, not only, not to harm,
but to benefit them all, and I saw malignant, imperfectly
balanced intelligences, capable of causing me
pain for mere caprice, and of deriving pleasure from
my sufferings; I was brutally attacked, I defended
myself fiercely. At first, they misunderstood the
horror with which I shrunk from a personal contest&mdash;from
the <i>idea of causing pain</i>&mdash;for cowardice.
They were soon undeceived. No superiority of
strength or skill was available against a boy who
would have died rather than own himself defeated,
and who was ever ready to renew an unequal struggle,
rather than endure an insult.</p>

<p>After a time, it ceased to enter any boy's head to
lay a finger on me; and yet I can truly say that if
they respected me, not a boy in the school feared me.
By degrees, they came to learn that my life was
different from theirs, and many, from some mysterious
instinct, treated me as one whose future was to
be famous and honored.</p>

<p>Dear young friends! never, never shall I forget
those prophecies of boyish affection destined in all
probability to be so dimly and imperfectly realized!</p>

<p>"Think," said young T&mdash;&mdash;, as I strolled with him
and H&mdash;&mdash;(the nephews of Sir J&mdash;&mdash; famous as the
friend of Lord B&mdash;&mdash;and a cabinet minister),
"think what a capital anecdote that running away
will make, when you are dead, and they write a big
life of you, like M&mdash;&mdash;'s life of B&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>O, exquisite, because unconscious flattery of
youthful faith and friendship! "<i>When I am dead</i>&mdash;yes,
that is the way of the world. So much is
done for us <i>after we are dead!</i> Think of Chatterton
and Edgar Poe!</p>

<p>It is well for a Lord Byron to wait for death, and
a Tom Moore to&mdash;<i>burn his memoirs</i>. A poor soldier
of fortune may as well let the world have the chance
of showing him some sympathy <i>before</i> that interesting
composition, the "funeral service," is read over
his remains. Even egotism itself may be excused,
when we reflect that the alternative is to <i>have one's
memoirs burned</i> at the request of one's amiable relatives,
by the d&mdash;&mdash;d good-natured friend to whom
they have been confidingly intrusted!</p>

<p>But you, <i>dear, dear Columbia</i>, type of the land
whose name you <i>ought</i> to bear, you will not burn
<i>my</i> memoirs, and perhaps, some day, even Old England,
and the highly respectable family of Mondel,
will confess that, however indiscreet the exposure,
there is a retributive justice in the sternly faithful
record of an exiled kinsman's sufferings.</p>

<p>As for the world at large, it can dispense with a
little modesty for the sake of so formidable an instalment
of truth, as the revelation of a whole human
life must necessarily prove.</p>

<p>To return to my narrative: I was fourteen years
old, I had attained the highest classical, mathematical
prizes, as also that for drawing&mdash;that is,
copying those chalk and pencil sketches which, in
an English drawing master's opinion, is a sufficient
initiation in the mysteries of <i>art</i> for&mdash;a gentleman
who is certain <i>not</i> to become an artist.</p>

<p>I think&mdash;oh, vanity of youth!&mdash;I really <i>think</i> I
should have carried off the prize for <i>dancing</i>, as well
as Greek, had I not committed the impropriety of
kissing the dancing-master's daughter, a little fairy
in white muslin, with lace-frilled trousers, whom I
met at a juvenile ball we gave at the end of the
half year.</p>

<p>Nothing is so apt to get one into scrapes as kissing
without reflection. To all young men I would say,
<i>think twice before you kiss anybody, however pretty</i>.
It is the first step that counts!</p>

<p>Alas! I have wept more tears in consequence of
random, unpremeditated kisses, than for all other
causes put together!</p>

<p>Oh, I would solemnly warn all the youth of
Europe, Asia, Africa, America, Australia and the
Polynesian Isles, above all things never, never to
kiss an ugly woman, because it is easy! for as sure <i>as</i>
you do it, you will immediately afterwards encounter
an angel of beauty, and the ugly woman will tell her
that you kissed her, and you may die of
despair perhaps, for a moment's thoughtless extravagance.</p>

<p>Many a man has wrecked his life and happiness
on a word, a look, but how many thousands have
eternally damned themselves&mdash;by a kiss!</p>

<p>Give anything in charity, gold, time, work, your
life, if you will, but never give a kiss out of pity!</p>

<p>Waste your all in gambling, in wine, in every possible
folly, but economize your kisses!</p>

<p>They rise up in judgment against you, like lies,
and indeed lies they are, for there is but one kiss
that man or woman should ever give, and that is the
kiss of true love, the seal of ineffable happiness!</p>

<p>For my part, I will kiss the true kiss, or by my
hopes of happiness, I will never kiss again!</p>

<p>Of late a German teacher was added to my usual
inflictions. Why I was to learn German&mdash;I, alone
of all the boys, was a mystery. But I found it a
relief; Professor Jacobi, was a good fellow, and
talked with me on general topics. Like many teachers
of languages, he rightly conceived that it was his
pupil's fault if he wasted the hour for which he paid.
So, although I did not learn German, I learned a
great deal about Germany, and things in general.
Professor Jacobi was no sage or prophet, but he was
the first man I had met, who talked to me <i>like</i> a
man, and for that I liked him.</p>

<p>The mystery was now unveiled. I was to complete
my education on the continent.</p>

<p>My father was, I fancy, glad to get a son, rapidly
approaching adolescence, out of the way, and to
enjoy the society of his young and pretty wife, undisturbed.
As for me, the idea of travel was enchanting
to my adventurous fancy.</p>

<p>I paid a farewell visit to my schoolfellows;
but already I was a man, and they were boys
in my eyes. <i>I had left school!</i> Sublime reflection!
I was going abroad, I was about to be <i>free!</i></p>

<p>O! sweet, sweet, liberty! how cheerfully have I
since sacrificed at thy shrine the most brilliant
chances of fortune, rank, place, power, even popularity!
for what is all the gold and honor in the
world, unless a man be <i>sovereign of himself?</i></p>

<p>Like Satan, I have preferred to reign in hell, to
serving in heaven. I have preferred the wild liberty
of the oft penniless poet, to the ease and luxury of
the prince's parasite, the partisan politician, the
dependent heir.</p>

<p>I have, it is true, walked on the margin of the
abyss of despair. In my fearlessness of death, I have
been driven to seek the courage to live. But my
will has been my law, my dull-souled oppressors
have been shaken off with scorn; my purpose has
been maintained, my aims, one by one, accomplished,
and now&mdash;I risk all once more, upon a cast of the
die, still lord and master of my fate, still firm in the
maintenance of my eternal code and its three magical
words, <i>Victory or Death</i>.</p>

<p>Another delightful discovery! I was to have no
private tutor to spy and watch over me. I was to be
entrusted to the care of a certain high government
functionary, <i>en retraite</i> (at the well-known town
of B&mdash;&mdash;n), a friend of my father's and of Major
&mdash;&mdash; the father of Mrs. T&mdash;&mdash;. This gentleman was
to receive me into his family, and treat me with
paternal consideration. Admirable old friend! I
shall never forget his kindness, or that of his lady,
and her accomplished daughter and son.</p>

<p>It is the only true glimpse of happy domestic life
I have ever enjoyed. But I anticipate events.</p>

<p>My father accompanied me to B&mdash;&mdash;n. We took
the steamer to Antwerp, and thence, by way of Brussels,
Li&eacute;ge, and Aix la Chapelle, reached Cologne,
whence a second steamer conveyed us to our
destination.</p>

<p>At Antwerp and Brussels, the magnificent picture
galleries, for the first time, awoke in me that love of
art, which has ever since made painting my most
beloved recreation. I may even venture to say, that
by the most round-about and irregular ways in the
world, I became eventually an artist, rather than an
amateur, since for many months of my life, at various
periods, I have owed my bread to my brush or
pencil, when all other resources failed me.</p>

<p>It was at B&mdash;&mdash;n, that I learned the manipulation
of the colors used in oil-painting. But these too, I
merely copied. The true knowledge of the theory
and practice of art, was to be acquired at a later
period in the studios of that rising school of
English painters, who, if my personal friendship and
the love they bore me, deceive me not, are destined
to become the great regenerators of the art&mdash;the
Titians and Da Vincis of the future!</p>

<p>My education it will be perceived, was such as
befitted a man predestined to fortune and worldly
position.</p>

<p>Besides the usual scholastic routine, I was
instructed in every athletic accomplishment. Riding,
swimming, fencing, the use of various arms, and
gymnastic exercises, were by no means neglected.
At the age of seventeen, I was "a cavalier, like other
cavaliers;" to quote the description of Goethe's
incomparable Mephistopheles.</p>

<p>I also <i>in</i>distinguished myself by drinking the best
wines, serenading the prettiest girls, fighting rapier-duels,
with young fire-eaters as wild as myself, and
finally, by falling in love with the most beautiful girl
in Germany&mdash;and to me, at that period, Germany was
the world, for in fact, though not a German by birth,
I was a student at a German University.</p>

<p>My complexion was at that time, pure and fresh as
a rose; my long hair fell, after the student fashion, in
curling abundance on my shoulders; my eyes were
clear as the heavens, which I contemplated from an
hundred mountain summits, in my daily rambles, on
foot or on horseback; my figure was erect, supple,
strong&mdash;in a word, I was then on the threshold of
manhood, and in the bloom of youthful pride and
vigor. I was not <i>yet</i>, as I soon afterwards became,
a <i>Slave of the Lamp</i>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I was a devourer of books from my
childhood. Before I was twelve years of age, I had as
I have described, read Shakspere's plays and Scott's
novels. I had read Fielding and Smollett; I had
read all Milton's poems, and numerous other British
classics. At fifteen, Byron and Shelly fell into my
hands, and, for the first time, showed me the darker
side of life, as well as its more brilliant joys. Then
I was in Germany, and Goethe and Schiller,
Hoffman, Wieland, Heine, and a host of others
became my familiar spirits. I fell in with Voltaire,
and new fields of speculation were opened to me.</p>

<p>Let me here revert, for an instant, to my school
days. I was about thirteen; my father was abroad;
I had to pass the holidays in part at T&mdash;&mdash;Q&mdash;&mdash;.
One day, I surreptitiously entered the drawing-room
by the window, and possessed myself of a superb copy
of Byron's Don Juan. With intense greediness
I read the first three cantos. I was in raptures&mdash;not
so much with the humor and the voluptuous fascination
of the descriptions, but with the magic ease
of the versification.</p>

<p>Two years later, I composed a poem of some
hundreds of stanzas in the same metre&mdash;the <i>octave
rime</i>. I mastered it at once. Rhyming was to me
second nature. My verse was fluent and correct at
the first attempt. It took me a long time to learn to
write prose&mdash;that is, to learn to <i>speak on paper</i>.</p>

<p>If <i>orators</i> would only learn to <i>write in speech!</i>
How much vapid windy verbalism we should be
spared at public meetings and in political assemblies!</p>

<p>At the same time, I had eagerly perused elementary
works on the natural sciences, and all the history
I could lay my hands on. I was ambitious of
universal knowledge, and universal distinction. I
wrote tales and poems, both in English and German,
and even in the Latin language. I began to aim
at inventions in machinery; I attended a course of
chemical lectures, by the most celebrated professor
of chemistry in Germany. My soul was of a grasping
and assimilating nature; its cravings were
unappeasable. I never retired to rest without a
book and a reading lamp, and too often I read till
the break of dawn reminded me of the necessity for
repose. It was a wonder my health did not suffer.
Irregular in my system of study, I attempted works
unequal to my strength. Before I was sixteen, I
translated Goethe's <i>Faust</i> into English verse.
Impatient of instruction, I profited little by my
masters. I drew caricatures of the professors at the
lectures, instead of taking notes, and practised pistol-shooting
with my French teacher instead of listening
to his expositions. Yet I acquired the French,
German, and Italian languages, almost without an
effort, impelled by a keen curiosity to read the books
I obtained. It seemed to me as if I acquired languages
by some wonderful process of induction. As
soon as I knew a few words, I guessed, or rather
reasoned out, by imperceptible logic, the meaning of
others. For example, I can read Spanish, yet I never
devoted three hours to its study. Grammars and
dictionaries I patronized little. <i>Language was my
element</i>. In it I lived and moved, and had my being.
Metres in versification were to me like the sciences
of music&mdash;a mathematical system, an unutterable
necessity to composition. I scarcely ever wrote an
incorrect line even in my childhood. I listened with
a smile to my companions who talked of writing by
ear, and then falsified their numbers. Such faults
were in my eyes unpardonable. A line with a false
accent, or a wanting or superfluous syllable was
simply, to my mind, <i>no verse at all</i>, a ridiculous
blunder, a thing beneath all criticism. Indeed it is
only in the English tongue, that such barbarous
fallacies as poetical liberties are practicable. In my
eyes, they are still abominations. A poet has no
more right to make a false verse, in order to squeeze
in an idea, than has an artist to violate perspective,
in order to bring two objects in juxtaposition.</p>

<p>It was shortly after my arrival at B&mdash;&mdash;n, that a
proposition was made to me to become the companion
and fellow-student of the present reigning Grand-duke
of * * * * at that time, nearly
of my own age. I declined the proposition instantly,
without even appreciating the compliment, though I
was to have received instruction with the young
prince, and have been his most intimate associate.
But I had in my soul the pride of fifty princes, and
the idea of becoming a dependent, a courtier, a
parasite, was to me inconceivable. But for this
haughty love of independence, I might perhaps at
this moment have been a titled minister, covered
with stars and orders, and the delight of my worldly
relatives; I preferred my liberty, and I prefer it
still.</p>

<p>I pass over the first two years of my residence on
the Rhine. They were years of study and reading,
and charming associations.</p>

<p>Herr K&mdash;&mdash;, in whose house I was domiciled,
was an ex-minister of Jerome Napoleon, ex-king
of Westphalia. He was very much like a French
courtier of the olden time in his manners, and a
pure Voltarian skeptic in his opinions. With regard
to religious matters, he had a remarkably humorous
way of laying his finger against his large aquiline
nose, elevating his grey bushy eyebrows, smiling
with every part of his face but his mouth, and saying
gravely&mdash;"No eye has seen, no ear has heard."
This was probably a quotation; where from I never
knew. Nor did the fine old gentleman ever moralise,
though he frequently impressed upon me that
dissipation was injurious to the health, and that
health was the <i>sine qua non</i> of enjoyment.</p>

<p>His age I never knew. He must have been then
near eighty.  His wife's brother, the Colonel (who
was at Waterloo when only sixteen), gravely assured
me one day that since his sister's marriage he had
never observed any perceptible change in K&mdash;&mdash;,
who was nevertheless as brisk as a young man, and
who played his game at <i>l'ombre</i> at his club every
evening with immutable regularity.</p>

<p>"I win two hundred dollars a year," said the old
diplomatist confidentially. "It keeps me in pocket money."</p>

<p>Colonel von R&mdash;&mdash;. was a fine old German baron,
and a popular officer with his regiment, which was
one of rifles, and then stationed at W&mdash;&mdash;w, beyond
Frankfort. But his great merit was&mdash;his daughter.
She came with him to B&mdash;&mdash;n, to the wedding of
Miss K&mdash;&mdash;, her cousin.</p>

<p>They talked much about her beforehand.  At
length she arrived. She was eighteen; a noble,
beautiful girl; tall, with dark brown hair, a fair
complexion, and soft eyes,&mdash;a figure from which to
model Graces; in a word, she was enchanting.</p>

<p>I was no longer a boy, I had just revisited England
with young K&mdash;&mdash; and my inseparable friend, the
Polish Baron de Rominski; I had experienced new
sensations, become a new being. Body and mind
had with my changed life and under the exhilarating
influence of <i>liberty</i>, become matured with unusual
rapidity. Every stranger supposed me to be two or
three years older than I really was.</p>

<p>I saw Rosalie, and a new life was revealed to me.
I had imagined love before, now I knew it. The
light of beauty descended upon my soul. I gazed
and dreamed and formed vague plans. Life began
to assume a form. With every day the thoughts and
cares of manhood grew more upon me.</p>

<p>I became indifferent to the Bacchanalian orgies
of the students. Nevertheless, one evening, at my
rooms, took place a grand drinking bout. I lived at
an hotel, overlooking the Rhine, in which the
K&mdash;&mdash;s had a suite of apartments, and I my separate
rooms.</p>

<p>In conclusion, long after midnight, the band of
intoxicated students ran wildly about the hotel,
changing the localities of all the boots and shoes,
and possessing themselves of Rosalie's, the shoe-strings
of which they divided in small pieces, and
swore to preserve as sacred relics to their dying
days.</p>

<p>I was myself far too elevated by the many flasks of
golden Rudesheimer and sparkling Moselle, to observe
clearly what was going on. The next day I was
severely enlightened. Rosalie was evidently deeply
offended. She would not speak to me for a long time;
at length I extorted from her the cause of her anger.</p>

<p>"To allow my name," she said, "to be made a
theme for the jests of a parcel of drunken students!"</p>

<p>I said little, but fixed on the three most prominent
actors in the scene of the previous night, and at
once challenged them severally, not to an ordinary
rapier duel, but to a meeting with the sabre, as usual
with military men in Germany, and amongst students,
for the gravest offences. A duel with the
sabre is, in my opinion, more dangerous than with
the pistol. However, in this case, two of the challenged
disclaimed all share of the shoe-string, and
the third backed out on the ground that he had
pledged his honor to his father (who was a clergyman),
never to fight a duel. It is not half so brave
a world as it would make believe. My friend the
Count N&mdash;&mdash;, called out six young noblemen of the
best families in Prussia, but insisted on the <i>pistol</i> as
a weapon. The result was, an offer to meet him with
the rapier; declined on the ground that N&mdash;&mdash; never
practised fencing. Finally, N&mdash;&mdash; accepted the
rapier on condition that every contest with the sword
should be followed by one with the pistol. Refused.
Negotiations followed negotiations. Finally, no one
fought; N&mdash;&mdash;, was triumphant. For my part, I
believe nine men out of ten to be natural poltroons.</p>

<p>In the Count's case, it was known that he was a
good shot, and he had let slip the remark, that six
Prussians, each with the left ear shot off, would cut
a queer figure.</p>

<p>But the six brave young noblemen declined to
submit themselves to the experiments of so dextrous
an artist.</p>

<p>An orthodox rapier duel is or was a burlesque
affair. We fought for the sake of fighting. On
a given day twenty or thirty "affairs" would come
off in a forest near the city. The belligerent parties
were enveloped in a padded leather apron tied under
the arms; a huge stock round the neck and absorbing
the chin, a cap with a large shade, and an
immense gauntlet on the right arm, completed the
arrangements.</p>

<p>Then at it they went on the word <i>los</i> (set-to!)
uttered by the seconds, who stood by, sword in hand,
ready to interpose their swords on either party being
touched. The result would be a cut nose or cheek,
which a piece of sticking-plaster, or at worst, a needle
and thread would remedy, though many were permanently
disfigured in these ridiculous contests. The
rapiers are very sharp at the edge. It is all cutting,
no thrusting is allowed; I had a cut myself under
the lip, which has left absolutely no trace, though
the scar did not entirely disappear for many years.
These duels generally originated in wanton jests or
drunken insults.</p>

<p>Although all young men, especially at universities,
or in the army, are inevitably impressed by the
atmosphere in which they move, I made up my mind
very resolutely not to allow the German students'
absurd <i>code</i> of honor&mdash;literally a <i>code</i> as long as an
act of Congress&mdash;to interfere with my reasonable
independence. Many of the "fighting" men at
B&mdash;&mdash;n practised with the rapier from morning till
night, and I was warned to avoid quarrelling with
these blood-thirsty gentry. My answer was very
simple, "I never <i>will</i> meet <i>such</i> fellows with <i>such</i>
weapons. If I meet them it will be seriously, with
chest exposed, sabre or pistol in hand." I was rarely
molested. Bullies and ruffians are <i>never</i> really brave.
They rarely attack those whom they cannot hope to
intimidate.</p>

<p>But with all their love of amateur fighting, I must
mention one fact to the credit of the German student.
He does not admit of a blow even as an insult. To
strike a fellow-student is to insure being sent to
Coventry by the decree of the Presidents or Seniors
of the Clubs, in convention assembled.</p>

<p>On the other hand "snobs," that is tradesmen, &amp;c.,
may be caned or thrashed to any extent. The student
assumes that it is absurd to apply codes of honor to
inferior orders of being, who cannot possibly understand
them.</p>

<p>The student drinks&mdash;that is his grand characteristic&mdash;he
drinks beer by the cask, wine by the dozen
bottles. He smokes long pipes, with great china
bowls, eternally.  At night he pervades the streets in
his robe-de-chambre and slippers, pipe in hand, on
his way to his club, that is&mdash;a private drinking
saloon. In parties of four he serenades the professors'
daughters. In parties of fifty he makes excursions
which result in a Commensch or extra drinking
bout. Since 1848 the student, however, is no longer
the student of my experience. He has become a
politician, and is spied by the police as mice are by
cats. Still he drinks hugely, but reserves much of
his fighting propensity for the grand coming day of
Revolution, when, as at Vienna, he will once more
strike for fatherland and liberty.</p>

<p>I yet <i>hope</i> to see a free Germany. But since the
miserable failure of the last great struggle, I no
longer venture to prophesy.</p>

<p>Time passed on, Miss K&mdash;&mdash;was married to
a Captain of Rifles, the accomplished C&mdash;&mdash;r, a musician,
composer, and author, who nearly killed a
brother officer in a sabre duel, without ever having
practised the use of the weapon, and who eventually,
I heard, quitted the army, and devoted himself to the
gentler services of the Muses altogether.</p>

<p>I read to Rosalie the works of Byron in a German
translation, and was wrapt up in her contemplation,
dreamed of her, and wrote of her, and loved her till
I brought on a fever, which might have become
dangerous, as I refused all medicines. But Rosalie
came, and at her hands I would have taken poison.
I recovered. I still loved on, and worked up my
imagination to the idea that my love was eternal and
incurable. Rosalie returned to her father's home. I
felt myself attracted to her as a needle by a magnet.
B&mdash;&mdash;n was to me no longer of any interest, since the
Baron de Rominski, my friend (an artist and poet too,
in his own sweet Polish tongue, which he began
to teach me), was going to Paris. I therefore
resolved to go to Berlin, and on the way to visit the
Colonel at W&mdash;&mdash;. He had given me a frank invitation,
and Rosalie confirmed it.</p>

<p>I wrote to my father, and, backed by the kind old
Aulic councillor K&mdash;&mdash;, succeeded in getting his consent,
and ample pecuniary supplies.</p>

<p>My last twenty-four hours at B&mdash;&mdash;n were spent in
prison. I was arrested for singing in the street with a
party of students at night, and, though released by the
watch on showing my card, was summoned next day
before Herr von Solomon, the University Judge, and
duly sentenced by that functionary, in the following
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Mondel, it is painful to me to inform you
that you will have the kindness to put yourself under
arrest, at the University prison, for the space of
twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>"But I wish to start to-day for Berlin."</p>

<p>"Oh! in that case, I will send on a note to the
authorities, and you can sit out your twenty-four
hours when you arrive there."</p>

<p>But the idea of <i>commencing</i> my abode in a new
city by going to prison, appeared to me even less
pleasant than concluding it in such a manner. So I
escorted myself quietly to the prison, and informed
the jailer that I had come to sit out my four-and-twenty
hours' incarceration!</p>

<p>"Walk in, sir, said the jailer, politely; "if you
want anything, ask for it; wine, coffee, dinner, anything
you please."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I have just breakfasted; what society
have you here?"</p>

<p>"There is Herr von P&mdash;&mdash;, sir, came in yesterday&mdash;booked
for a week."</p>

<p>I knew Herr von P&mdash;&mdash; slightly, and we were
soon engaged in a game at <i>ecart&eacute;</i>, very much to the
profit of the Herr von P&mdash;&mdash;, and very little to my
amusement; as I have not a particle of the gambler
in my composition.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of play amongst the
students at B&mdash;&mdash;n.</p>

<p>P&mdash;&mdash; was a noted gambler, and made much
money out of innocent young gentlemen. He
belonged, to the most aristocratic clique, and it was
said paid his expenses out of the losses of his friends.</p>

<p>P&mdash;&mdash; once made a singular bet with Count
N&mdash;&mdash; (of pistol-shooting repute). It was that he
would sit up longer at <i>ecart&eacute;</i> than N&mdash;&mdash;. The bet
was a hundred dollars. They sat playing for six and
thirty hours, and made it a drawn bet by mutual
consent, but P&mdash;&mdash; <i>had won two hundred and
seventy-three dollars at the game</i>.</p>

<p>Why, however, do I linger over these trivial reminiscences
of youth? Let me hasten with my story.</p>

<p>I followed Rosalie to W&mdash;&mdash;. I stayed there a
whole month, and with a tremendous effort bade her
farewell, and continued my journey to Berlin. On
the road I met with a curious example of honesty&mdash;I
dropped a roll of notes at a wayside inn, where I
stopped to dine, and the diligence or Schnell-post
(quick-post, <i>lucus a non</i>) was already in motion when
the waiter followed me, and thrusting his hand in at
the window gave me the undiminished roll of notes.
I had not even time to separate one of them from its
fellows and give it to the poor man for his trouble.</p>

<p>Nothing else happened on the road worthy of
mention, save my tragic loss of dear R&mdash;&mdash;'s parting
present, a splendid gold-headed bamboo, which
slipped out of the window, whilst I was asleep, from
the straps at the top of the vehicle. I would rather
have lost half my next quarter's income, which I
carried in my carpet bag, in the shape of some four
hundred five-franc pieces&mdash;each then, practically
worth perhaps, three times as much in Berlin, as is
now a dollar in New York.</p>

<p>When I reached Berlin, I felt myself for the first
time my own master. I threw my quarter's income
into a drawer of my escritoire. It lasted me precisely
three weeks, instead of three months. However,
credit and friendly loans carried me on to the
end of the second month, when I ventured on an
application to my father, and was supplied with the
requisite means, accompanied by a severe lecture and
an intimation that for the future I should draw a
diminished income monthly from a banker's. However,
the banker was accommodating, and I managed
to keep afloat, with the assistance of my friend, A&mdash;&mdash;
(the son of Germany's most popular living poet.)
We made common purse, and were rarely utterly
drained, though we went to the opera regularly,
drank the best wine we could discover, and made
generally as profound a business of pleasure as most
men of our years and position.</p>

<p>On my first arrival in the Prussian capital, I
presented a letter of introduction from Madame
K&mdash;&mdash; to the Baroness von W&mdash;&mdash;, wife of the
General von W&mdash;&mdash;. They treated me with unvarying
hospitality, and the young baron, who was also a
Captain in the Royal Guards, volunteered to show me
Berlin <i>du fond en comble</i>.  I quote his own phraseology.</p>

<p>This he did, but what most interested me was a
lovely girl of my own age, who sold gloves in a little
shop at the corner of the Frederich Strasse, close to
the bridge.</p>

<p>And now I wish to do what no modern writer
has dared to do. I wish to tear off the mask of
hypocrisy with which men insult the reason and
delude the fancy of women in polite society in
England and America. In <i>France</i> the truth is
allowed to be written on social matters, though
political discussion is forbidden. With <i>us</i> we may
preach any political doctrines we please, but it is an
impropriety to allude to facts of universal importance
of the greatest social interest. It is not of
shocking exceptions but of general truth that I wish
to speak.</p>

<p>Men do not, <i>cannot</i>, lead the lives of women
before marriage. No man, who is anything or anybody,
ever reaches the age of thirty years unmarried
without numerous adventures more or less serious
with the other sex. It is <i>impossible</i> from the constitution
of society that there should be even a <i>single</i>
exception to this rule, save in the case of unfortunates
who, by imprisonment, ill-health or natural
imbecility, were artificially isolated. My experience
of the young men of the upper classes of society in
many countries justifies me in saying that precisely
those men who have been stigmatised as rou&eacute;s and
libertines have been generally the most intellectual
and honorable, in fact, truly virtuous men, I have
met with. I will go further, the man in whom the
passion of love is strongest will naturally be engaged
in most adventures, and also best able to distinguish
between the real love and the false. The man who
has experience has also appreciation. In a word it is
useless to condemn that which is universal.</p>

<p>If any hypocrites, or would-be saints, deny the
<i>fact</i>&mdash;I pity them sincerely if they have acted up to
principles which Nature imperatively refutes.</p>

<p>The remedy for this evil, if evil it be, is early
marriage, and absolute liberty of divorce. People
are afraid to marry from the idea that it is taking a
step which is <i>irremediable</i>, that it is risking a whole
life's happiness in a chance. How wretchedly wicked
and foolish are such institutions! Make divorce as
easy as marriage, and the whole class of degraded
women would almost instantly vanish. Even men
would shrink from such miserable pleasures, and, <i>at
length, the first real step</i> in social progress would be
taken.</p>

<p>As there are degrees in love, so there should be
variety of duration in marriage.</p>

<p>To enjoy the highest, the <i>eternal</i> love, is the privilege
of few, to the many should be given at least the
chance of finding the nearest approximation to that
ideal felicity.</p>

<p>Again, when a man once <i>does</i> experience the <i>great</i>
passion, how absurd to reproach him with the minor
caprices of the past. As wisely reproach a great
poet for the bad verses of his boyhood.</p>

<p>All young men of rank and culture, are, out of
sight of their mothers and sisters, theoretical and
practical Don Juans.</p>

<p>In this creed I too was nurtured, even before I
knew what it meant, at school. In after life it never
was my lot to find any circle of young men who did
not possess the Don Juanic faith, at any rate up to
the epoch of marriage.</p>

<p>Of married men I shall say nothing: I dare not.
I will hope that my friends have been exceptions to
the rule. For my part I <i>pity</i> a man who can be
unfaithful to his wife. I could not bear to live with
a woman to whom I COULD be unfaithful.</p>

<p>The pretty glove-girl charmed me, yet I still
dreamed of Rosalie.</p>

<p>Six months later the little glove-girl married an
old Philistine, as all non-students or citizens are
called in the Burschen tongue.</p>

<p>I was in a moderate state of pique.</p>

<p>Four years later, when I was compelled by circumstances
to abandon all hope of returning to Germany,
to demand the hand of Rosalie, I was in a
state of despair.</p>

<p>So vast is the gulf between a mere intrigue and a
love-dream, however vague.</p>

<p>Five years later Rosalie was married to a judge,
the president of a college of officials in Prussia.
I never saw her after my departure for Berlin.</p>

<p>I think it must be admitted that the love of boys is
rather of the imagination than of the deeper life,
rather of the senses than of the heart.</p>

<p>At Berlin I first drank deeply and eagerly at the
inexhaustible fountain of metaphysics. At that time
the mind of the studious portion of the German
youth was absorbed in the transcendental philosophy
of Hegel and Schelling. The latter was still alive,
and lecturing at the University. But his great rival
was still more alive in the souls of his disciples. At
first I was mystified by the abstract terms employed.
Then I understood, and&mdash;O monstrous presumption
of boyish audacity&mdash;I cavilled and questioned. I
denied that the substantial matter at issue in all philosophy
was really affected by Hegel's logic. But I
seized on the application of philosophy to life. I
became a republican amongst republicans, and
helped to lay the seeds of the revolution which in
1848 shook all Europe to its foundations.</p>

<p>At Berlin I continued to read much, and to disdain
the tedious road to knowledge which the lecture-rooms
offered. Such a system may serve minds deficient
in self-reliance, and temperaments naturally
slow. To the born student, it is a tiresome obstacle
to the enthusiastic love of knowledge, which rests not
till it obtains its satisfaction.</p>

<p>In this city also I was a great theatre-goer, and
accompanied by A&mdash;&mdash;, I heard at the Royal Opera
those masterpieces of music to which the world is
never tired of listening. My friend, who lived in the
same house with me, was himself a fine player on the
pianoforte, and it is from this epoch more especially
that I date the development of a passionate taste for
harmony, and a fuller appreciation of those delights,
without which poets have found even their visions of
heaven incomplete.</p>

<p>I even commenced the study of music as a
science, and attempted to compose some airs. It
will be seen how these projects, with many others
of my universally ambitious idiosyncrasy, were frustrated
by circumstances, against which I have in vain
rebelled, even up to the moment of this present
writing.</p>

<p>But hitherto I had merely led a life of preparation.
I had been a child of fortune, petted, caressed, and
lapped in luxury. If the early shadows of my family
history had thrown a gloom over my brilliant student
travels and studies, it needed the presentiment of
future sorrows to afflict me with that melancholy
which, from the period of adolescence, has been my
inseparable companion.</p>

<p>Strange to say, this funereal and incurable gloom
which has ever wrapped me as in a mantle, is to the
eye of the outer world, counterbalanced by a sense
of humor, and what I may truly call, a vigor of merriment
rarely equalled. But it is a foolish blunder to
confound mirth with enjoyment. How often has my
loud laugh shaken the air, when within my heart the
vision of Death sat enthroned, and palpable to my
soul! How often have I seated myself to write the
most facetious articles, the most ludicrous pieces of
versification, by an effort of almost superhuman self-conquest
over mental anguish and depression.
Dearest! I have more than once paused over a half
finished tale, or at the end of the first act of a
comedy, to ask myself the solemn question, whether
it was worth while to torture my brain even for one
instant longer, to preserve an existence so utterly
mortifying and miserable.</p>

<p>Am I alone an isolated example? I know not. I
will hope that few have suffered as I have suffered,
in the age of so-called civilization we live in!</p>

<p>And here I will pause to cite one remark, profound,
terrible, and indisputable, in answer to the
cant which replies to the agony expressed by the
great thinkers of earth, by a trivial reference to the
more obvious sufferings of beings of inferior intelligence.</p>

<p>The degree of suffering is in proportion to the
capacity to suffer. The strongest nature and the
loftiest intellect, are subject to exquisite tortures, of
which the boor and the drudge of routine is unsusceptible.</p>

<p>Again, under a certain amount of pain, feeble
natures give way: delirium, lunacy, or death, come
to their relief. It is the awful privilege of the strong
to bear&mdash;unbent, unbroken, still to bear.</p>

<p>My last act in Germany was to leave Berlin and
bury myself in the midst of vast pine forests on the
shore of the Lake of Tegel. There, with my books,
and the use of a boat, in which I paddled myself
about on the lake, I lived in utter solitude at the
house of a forester, an old soldier, who had received
his place as a reward for services during the war
against Napoleon.</p>

<p>Just as I became accustomed, by a six weeks' experiment,
to this new and meditative communion with
nature, I received a summons from my impatient
and unquiet father, who was, indeed, ever tormenting
me with his restless suspicion, commanding my
immediate return to England.</p>

<p>I returned to Berlin, bade farewell to my friends,
and took the Schnell-Post for Hamburgh. It was a
bitterly cold journey, in the month of November, and
a poor young actress who was the only other occupant
of the spacious vehicle during the whole journey,
was nearly frozen to death, notwithstanding
that I gave her my overshoes and thickest cloak.
Truly, never did young student and pretty girl
huddle together with more innocent feelings, than
did we during that terrible three days' voyage. It
was like the retreat from Moscow. Meanwhile, there
was heat caught elsewhere; for, during our journey,
Hamburgh was almost entirely burnt to the
ground, and we entered a city over which the
destroying angel appeared to have passed.</p>

<p>We put up at a half-burnt hotel, and three days
after, with many kisses, bade one another farewell
for ever, in all human probability.</p>

<p>I took the steamer for London, and arrived safely,
despite a storm of the most violent character.
Never could I cross even the straits of Dover without
a storm!</p>

<p>I met with a cold reception; and not a week
elapsed before my father desired me to find separate
lodgings for myself. He preferred the additional
expense to my presence in his house. I was no
longer <i>at home</i>.</p>

<p>Already I felt my dependence upon my father an
oppression.</p>

<p>On my return, I commenced nominally the study
of the law, really, the pursuit of literature, as the
stepping-stone to fame and power.</p>

<p>Whilst forcing myself to study a repugnant profession,
from a sense of duty towards my father, I
devoted every leisure moment to reading and composition.
This I could the more easily do that I had
absolutely no friends or acquaintances in London.
By my early transplantation to Germany I had lost
sight of all my school-friends, and as my father had
separated himself from all his old connections, on
account of his marriage; as, moreover, he almost
treated me as a stranger, except in matters of paternal
authority, I found myself in the most isolated
position imaginable. Brought up with brilliant
prospects, and accustomed to refined society and
abundant social intercourse, I had suddenly strayed
into a bleak desert, and was, for the first time in my
life, <i>alone in a great city</i>.</p>

<p>I had yet to learn <i>how</i> lonely a man may be in the
midst of all the luxury and gaieties of a vast metropolis,
when misfortune segregates him from his fellows,
and he becomes indeed as one having a
leprosy, with whom no man may hold communion.</p>

<p>The slavery of the lamp now began; but as yet
it was a voluntary servitude.</p>

<p>A humorous incident decided my first appearance
in print.</p>

<p>My poems&mdash;imitations of Byron, translations of
Schiller, Goethe, &amp;c.,&mdash;being very wisely rejected by
the great publishers, I, with the indomitable pertinacity
of the true author, commenced laying siege
to the small ones. In these attacks, I had no guide,
philosopher, or friend; in my innocence I walked
into the first bookseller's shop I came to, who affixed
the more dignified title of publisher to his sign,
and confidently proposed to make his fortune. It
was from one of the poorest and humblest of the
tribe, that I received the following amicable counsel.

"Sir," said the printer, publisher, editor,
and compiler of "<i>Brown's Miscellaneous Broad-sheet</i>,"
"your poetry is very fine, I should like to publish it
in my journal; but as I shall be in the gazette
next week (i. e. bankrupt), I cannot indulge my
inclination. Sir, your poetry is very fine, but
poetry does not pay. You are too high, sir, a great
deal too high. Write down to the people, sir, write
something about what they know and understand,
and you will succeed. I suppose you could write
prose&mdash;a novel, for example?"</p>

<p>"I could write anything," was my reply, and my
modest belief, in my then state of scribblomaniac
fanaticism.</p>

<p>"Well, write down, sir, if it is only for once in a
way; just to try the experiment."</p>

<p>"<i>I will</i>," said I emphatically, and I left the
publisher to his reflections, and his bankruptcy. I
never saw him more; but his words never ceased to
ring in my ears. Of their wisdom I have been but
too well convinced, by experience. My lightest,
most careless, most imperfect efforts have alone
attained popularity. Those works in which I have
put forth all my strength, in which I have as it were
concentrated my life, my science, and my art, have
been passed over by the multitude unnoticed. For
doing what hundreds could do as well, or better
than myself, I have received unqualified testimonies
of approval. For accomplishing what no other
could have accomplished, I have at best received the
qualified applause of a few friends or critics. As
every original man can do certain special things,
better than any other, I do not by the above sentence
assert any arrogant claim to superiority. I merely
assert a claim common to that class who alone can
strictly and particularly be included under the
denomination&mdash;Thinkers and Poets. I may be the
last in its ranks, but to this class I naturally pertain;
and as I have fairly proved my claim by my labors,
I have never yet had the misfortune to hear it disputed;
if, on the other hand, I have but rarely
heard it acknowledged with candor.</p>

<p>I sat down to follow the advice of the bankrupt
publisher, nor did I underrate his advice on account
of his own failure. Men learn wisdom by misfortune.
I obeyed his hint, in the widest acceptation of the
word; for, after writing poems in which nothing short
of princes, knights, grand inquisitors, and magicians,
were admissible, I at once descended to the very
bottom of the social scale, and made my hero&mdash;a
beggar. Finding novel-writing easy; in my utter
ignorance of art, I soon scribbled half a dozen chapters,
and having, with Machiavellian foresight,
prepared a dozen different titles, all adaptable to the
same embryo novel, I once more sallied forth a
literary Don Quixote, in search of a publishing
castle to storm.</p>

<p>By a singular chance the very first shop I entered
was the very best in London I could have selected.
The proprietors were enterprising young beginners,
who printed cheap illustrated works, of an unexceptionable
class. I showed them my catalogue of
titles like a bagman, who shows the list of his
goods.</p>

<p>They were regarded with evident, though disguised,
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"And have you written all these tales?" said the
partner with whom I negotiated.</p>

<p>"They are not all completed," said I coolly, "but
many of them are in progress."</p>

<p>The publisher selected one of the titles as particularly
attractive.</p>

<p>"Fortunately," said I, "I have the first chapters of
that very tale in my pocket," and I produced my
omnivorous manuscript with a slight blush.</p>

<p>"If you will call again the day after to-morrow,
you shall have an answer," said the publisher.</p>

<p>Of course I was punctual. The publisher asked
but one question&mdash;the price.</p>

<p>I was so dizzy with my triumph, and the prospect
of seeing myself in print, that I answered, by stating
the first round sum that came into my head, and
which happened to be ten pounds.</p>

<p>"We shall require twenty numbers, of eight pages
each," said the publisher.</p>

<p>I acquiesced without reflection, still intoxicated
with my success.</p>

<p>The tale appeared. It sold by some thousands of
copies, and I became almost immediately the editor
of an illustrated paper, or rather weekly magazine,
which I supplied with tales, horrible, sentimental and
comic, with editorial leaders, with satirical poems,
puns, wood-cuts and epigrams. I worked awfully
hard, and gained about as large an income as&mdash;most
hack writers, and lawyers' clerks. Some years later,
when I really strove to <i>live</i> by literature, I failed to
secure so good an income. The regular newspaper
editor and the really famous author, are the only men
who can live decently by literature. Magazine and
periodical writing in all its branches, high and low,
is a mere lottery even to the comparatively lucky ones.
Ten years of observation and personal struggle
enable me to state this general fact so decisively,
that I venture to accuse any man of monomania who
voluntarily persists in such a career. Many have no
choice in the matter, and these must of course bend
to the inevitable destinies.</p>

<p>In ten weeks the illustrated paper died. The novel
was, at the publishers' request, wound up summarily.
I killed off all the characters in my hurry, and forgot
even to leave one alive to tell the story. The publishers
absconded. The shop was to let.</p>

<p>My father, who had regarded my proceedings
with mingled amazement and annoyance, was glad to
see me deprived of the opportunity of scribbling.
Indeed, literary life is all ups and downs, and the
down had now arrived. I wrote a few sketches for
some obscure papers, and then found no further opening.
Under these circumstances, I rested on my laurels,
gave the few people I knew nicely bound copies
of my abruptly wound-up "biography of a beggar,"
and once more relapsed into law, study, and isolation.</p>

<p>A droll adventure happened to me at this period.
An elderly gentleman who was compiling an arch&aelig;ological
romance, advertised for literary assistance. I
called upon him; and he requested me to put the
<i>sentiment</i> into his book, "which, otherwise," he
added, "I must cabbage from James and Bulwer, for
sentiment is out of my line!"</p>

<p>However, I expressed so freely to him my views as
to the necessity of a plot to a romance, that we disagreed
about terms, and parted, like my two friends
who went to see the sun rise on a foggy morning, and
quarrelled on the top of a mountain&mdash;to meet no more.</p>

<p>I now commenced the translation of a voluminous
German work, and applied myself till late in the
night with such ardor, that all suddenly I was seized
with a fierce fever, became delirious, and for weeks
together lost all consciousness of the outer world.</p>

<p>During this illness I was abandoned to the care of
a young doctor, who followed the old fashioned system
of reduction to an extent I barely survived, and
to the attentions of the people in whose house I had
lodgings.</p>

<p>When I recovered I met with neither kindness nor
sympathy. My step-mother was my secret, interested,
and determined enemy. My father's affections
were utterly alienated. I was doubly alone. My
books were my only friends. Therefore I addressed to
them a poem, perhaps the first tolerable attempt of the
kind I had ever made, except translations, for which
my delicate perception of idioms and their equivalents,
gave me a peculiar facility.</p>

<p>I was not yet truly a slave of the lamp. But the
hour was at hand. I was but nineteen years of age.
It struck; and my doom was sealed.</p>

<p>Like the tiger that has tasted blood, I tasted
the sweet poison of popular fame, and from that moment
the thirst was insatiable!</p>

<p>Since that date precisely ten years have elapsed;
ten years, during which time the demon of unrest
has been my familiar spirit. The genius of desperation
my almost constant tempter; my faith in the
Beautiful my only source of consolation.</p>

<p>A book appeared, the manifesto of a man who
aimed at leading a party.</p>

<p>It was a brilliant book, and the parliamentary position
of its author gave it great importance. The
papers were full of it.</p>

<p>The retrograde progressionists advanced (like crabs
backwards) in power. Nevertheless, the book was a
humbug, the "principles" it advocated fallacious, the
ideas plagiarisms, its sentiment artifice, and its effect
clap-trap.</p>

<p>It was full of plausible nonsense, and sublime bombast.
There was not a particle of honesty, truth, or
real greatness of soul in the book or in its author&mdash;an
ambitious and intriguing adventurer, who, by dint of
a rich marriage and exquisite policy, eventually
became the leader of the ultra-stupid, that is, aristocratic
party, in England, and, for a brief space, a
cabinet minister.</p>

<p>I resolved to answer the book, and hold it up to
the ridicule and contempt it deserved.</p>

<p>I wrote a novel; a bold, dashing, satirical extravaganza.
It succeeded, sold largely, was reviewed in
all the papers, and was even the subject of lengthy
articles in the magazines. Its authorship was a
mystery; it was attributed to authors of established
fame and talent.</p>

<p>It produced me, however, little, save fame and an
offer from the publisher&mdash;one of the grandees of his
class&mdash;to follow up my success, by a second attempt.
The publisher even advanced me money on the
strength of the future.</p>

<p>Already I was beginning to feel embarrassed, as,
since my return from abroad, I was barely supplied
with the funds necessary to sustain my position, and
supply my necessities. My income was doled out
to me by degrees. I was questioned, doubted, lectured
by my father, and contradicted and insulted
by my step-mother, whose defective education, added
to natural weakness of mind, made her an implacable
torment.</p>

<p>The Slavery of the Lamp had begun.</p>

<p>A violent quarrel with my father, the result of a
long train of petty annoyances on the part of himself
and my step-mother, drove me to an abrupt decision.</p>

<p>I quitted the chambers, or rather garrets, which
my father had allotted to me, in one of his houses,
and sought the hospitality of my maternal uncle.</p>

<p>I had not seen him since I was a child; he was the
younger of my mother's two brothers. He resided
in London. This brother was domiciled at New
Orleans. My grandmother was an Englishwoman,
and after my grandfather's death, resided partly on
her own estate of Lakeland, partly in London, at her
house in P&mdash;&mdash; Square.</p>

<p>My father's separation from my mother, had naturally
separated him from her family.</p>

<p>I wrote to my uncle, who was a distinguished man
of science, an author, and a travelled connoisseur in
art&mdash;himself an admirable amateur artist.</p>

<p>He replied gracefully to my letter, accompanied
by a copy of my new work, inviting me to dine with
him at his club. In England, dinner and friendship
are inseparable ideas.</p>

<p>At six o' clock precisely, I entered the splendid,
club-house in St. James's Square, and was conducted
by a powdered footman into the presence of Mr.
Harley. A tall, spare, but powerful man, of some
three and thirty years, with a pale face, and deeply
sunken, intense eyes, rose to welcome me, with
languid cordiality, but with perfectly easy and
natural manner of one accustomed to the refinement
of the very highest society.</p>

<p>He appeared pleased with my appearance. We
conversed freely, on general and family matters.
For the first time since I had returned from Germany,
I felt as if I <i>had</i> a family, a name, and a friend.
Hitherto so ghastly was the change from my brilliant
continental life, with its gay companionship, its lively
balls, its constant excitement, and my position as a
young "milord," to the solitude and comparative
penury of my London life, that I seemed to myself
an abstraction, a nightmare-ridden hero of Hoffman,
rather than an only son and heir, in two English
families of undoubted position. In England, without
family, a man is nothing. He has no introduction to
society, he knows nobody, he is not recognized, he
does not exist. People always ask who is a young
man's father, who his grandfather? Not even at the
actual shopkeeper does the aristocratic prejudice
stop. I never knew a man in England, who was
not, somehow or other, of noble family, except a
downright honest mechanic. In this respect Englishmen
are as bad as Irishmen, only their pride causes
them to keep quiet, and not absolutely ram their
ramified pedigrees down the throats of their acquaintance!</p>

<p>What a droll vanity! Are we not all cousins of
the order mammal, genus bimana, species man?</p>

<p>After dining with my uncle, he took me to a <i>soir&eacute;e</i>
in Belgrave Square, having previously arranged my
introduction. After nearly two years in London,
it was the first party at which, except at my father's
house, I had been present! My father had always
refused all invitations for me, from his own newly-formed
circle, such as it was&mdash;with few exceptions
a miscellaneous horde of parvenus and parasites.</p>

<p>But the study of my uncle himself interested me
more than all the titled and untitled celebrities I
encountered in the society to which he introduced
me; and in which I was, thanks to my book and
natural vivacity, treated, as the French say, with
distinguished consideration.</p>

<p>Indeed nothing astonished or impressed me much
in this new sphere. Had I not, in Germany, conversed
with the great Schlegel, the friend of Madame de
Sta&euml;l, and the translator of Shakspere? Had I not
danced with countesses and associated with princes?
The "great world" was the only world of which I
knew anything, and of that I knew little, it is true;
but then I had read all the novels of the age, and
novels are&mdash;or ought to be&mdash;the mirrors of society.</p>

<p>But George Harley puzzled me. He was not as
other men. The objects of his life appeared to be
purely intellectual. He was a magnetizer, a phrenologist,
a materialist philosopher. He was constantly
on the look-out for new ideas and strange books.
He knew strange men, famous for strange specialities.
One day he introduced me to an astrologer,
the next to M&mdash;&mdash; F&mdash;&mdash;, afterward Countess of
O&mdash;&mdash;i, a strong-minded American lady. He had a
curious sympathy with trees and landscape effects,
and would walk with me for hours, discussing philosophy
till long after midnight, through the deserted
streets or round the silent Regent's Park, near which
his house was situate.</p>

<p>But there was a mysterious indifference, a cold
pride (not hauteur&mdash;he was quiet, gentle and affable
in manner), about him. The upper part of his face
was superb, his lips thin, compressed, stern, and full
of sadness. He seemed to have no strong passions
but anger, which he suppressed, and scorn which
he gave vent to in cynical analyses of men and
their motives. He interested, yet oppressed me.
I loved him with a vague misgiving. I doubted
whether he was capable of affection. Yet he treated
me at that time with kindness, and gave me his
confidence so far as, perhaps, he was capable of
confiding. He seemed to be occupied solely with
the study of man and his organization. He absolutely
hated the idea of a future state, repudiated all
spiritual theories and transcendental metaphysics,
and though handsome, and possessing worldly advantages,
the thought of marriage never seemed to enter
his mind.</p>

<p>Had he been disappointed in love? I often asked
myself. Yet all the women I saw appeared to
admire, many to idolize, this cold, strange, unimpressible
man. He treated them like children, and
they looked up to him as a wonder and a mystery.</p>

<p>Suddenly the mania for railway speculation broke
out. All classes were infected, and lo! my grave
uncle, who seemed to live but in science and dreams
became, presto, a speculator. He enabled me also to
speculate on a miniature scale. I gained, as if by
magic, considerable sums of money. Ere long came
the crash. Harley, who at one time had been almost
a millionaire, was, after all, a loser of thousands of
pounds. He became gloomy and anxious, and
relapsed into his old habits, but as it seemed to me
without zest or interest. The even tenor of his
life was broken. We became estranged by degrees,
and when my hour of real imperative trouble arrived,
he too, deserted me.</p>

<p>It soon came. At twenty I had published my
second novel. It was well received, but the times
were bad, the terrible railway crash absorbed the
universal attention. Nevertheless, the produce of my
fortunate speculations, with the profits of my book,
were enough to sustain me in a life of luxury and
ease.</p>

<p>I shall never cease to remember with pleasure a
delightful trip to Paris, made with my friend Templeton
Bivar, a relative of Lord Bivar's, but himself the
son of a half-pay Major in the army, and of the
slenderest pecuniary resources. He was two years
younger than myself, a noble, talented, enthusiastic
young fellow; tall, blue-eyed, with black hair, a fresh
color, and the features of an Apollo. His sisters
were surpassingly beautiful; their presentation at
court produced quite a sensation. Bivar was full of
humor, and his judgment was pure and true as his
heart was generous and faithful. He has always
been, he still is, my friend and brother in soul. We
have rendered each other a thousand services,
seconded each other in affairs of honor, aided one
another in affairs of love. We have shared prosperity
and adversity, we have never had two purses.
Together we have battled with the world, and together
we have, at least, triumphed over obscurity,
and taught men to recognize our existence in the
world of art and literature. Whenever we have been
separated, our worst misfortunes have happened.
Rominski is the only friend I ever had, who
approached Bivar in chivalric grandeur of sentiment
and action. Bivar was emphatically a gentleman.</p>

<p>And here let me abandon for a brief space the
external progress, to record the spiritual movements
of my life.</p>

<p>I was now a man, I corresponded with a celebrated
authoress and a famous poet, I lived in and of the
world, I had some reputation as an anonymous
author. I had tasted to a certain extent the feeling
of independence. I began to feel my intellectual
power, and to meditate earnestly on man and his destinies.
My conversations with Harley, and my arguments
against his material theories had strengthened
my own convictions. I felt the necessity of systematizing
my speculations.</p>

<p>I found myself mentally at war with all received
ideas. In politics I was virtually an anarchist, in
religion an atheist. In morals I was a skeptic.</p>

<p>I had to reconstruct the universe from its elements,
and to account for its apparent inconsistencies.</p>

<p>Familiar with the theories of the ancient Hindoo
philosophers, the Greek, the English, the French, the
German schools of all shades, alike versed in material
facts and fancies, as in transcendental formulas, without
prejudice or bias, seeking only knowledge, I was
as ready to follow August Compte or the Baron von
Reichenbach; as Berkeley the bishop, or Spinoza the
Hebrew; as ready to listen to the inductions from
Harley's experiments, as to the sublime doctrines of
Fichte and the audacious logic of Hegel.</p>

<p>I was an impartial investigator, not however, an
eclectic. To me Victor Cousin was&mdash;an academician.</p>

<p>I desired a new form for the one great truth.</p>

<p>The result was my system of <i>Atomic Individualism</i>,
with which the philosophic world is acquainted.</p>

<p>What will, perhaps, surprise any students of
ontology who may read this work, is the unprecedented
fact that my system was, and is (for I still
hold the same opinions), neither spiritual nor material,
according to the ordinary acceptation of the terms,
but rather a reconciliation of the two hostile, or
supposed hostile, theories, which may be most correctly
defined as mathematical.</p>

<p>I could not, with the idealists, admit that ideas
were the fundamental realities of existence, because
ideas were ever changing. Nor could I allow, with the
materialists, that matter was the essence of all things,
because, matter being infinitely divisible, had evidently
no ultimate particles, and therefore resolved
itself into nothing but forms and phenomena.</p>

<p>To exist absolutely, a thing must exist immutably
and independently, because it <i>is</i>&mdash;and for no other
reason. Now, ideas only exist because we conceive
them, and matter only exists&mdash;if it be supposed
to exist apart from ideas at all&mdash;in relation to other
matter. In a word, both ideas and matter have
merely a comparative and proportionate, not a real
and absolute existence.</p>

<p>Both depend upon the sentient beings' power of
perceiving their existence. Hence, I was driven to
conclude that the ultimate atoms of the universe
were sentient points, having neither length, breadth,
nor qualities, and that all existences, apparent or real,
were simply the relations, I may say, for want of a
better phrase, the mathematical relations, of these
points to one another (perhaps intertortuosity of infinitely
extensible atoms). That power or force existed,
moreover, was undeniable, else constant change
and movement would be impossible. And as all
force exerted must proceed ultimately from some
determinate point, I concluded that each of these
vital atoms was the centre from which it necessarily
emanated, and that volition was the pure and radical
nature of this primitive force. In fact, that the
idea of universal forces governing the world, was
at bottom nothing but an imperfect glimmering of
the notion of the united action of the will or force
resident in every individual atom or spirit.</p>

<p>This will or force amounted then, in mathematical
parlance, to a power of changing its position with
reference to other spiritual atoms, or vital centres,
possessed by each individual atom. On these
relations depended the sentient condition of the
atom. Hence, as I assumed the necessary existence
of free-will, or independent self-originating motion
in each point of intelligence or ultimate atom of
the infinite, I also assumed, as the inevitable principle
of every such atom's motions, the desire to place
itself in a condition most productive of the
sense of enjoyment; to seek which, and avoid its opposite,
pain (or as Locke calls it, uneasiness), must be the
fundamental craving of every sentient being, or
spirit.</p>

<p>This relation of one atom to the rest, is what in
mundane parlance is called circumstance, a phrase
which betrays an unconscious presentment of my
philosophy; as implying a sentient centre, surrounded
by external entities. I also saw that as all motion
must logically spring from central points, so all
will must be governed by primitive motive or
impulse. Hence, that the desire of selfish enjoyment
must be the fountain of all actions whatsoever.</p>

<p>Hence that, humanly speaking, the great object of
this life, as of all other modes of existence, must be
to place oneself in the most favorable circumstances
for enjoying the highest degree of sensual and intellectual
pleasure, which are, at bottom, mere varieties
of the same action.</p>

<p>Such was the substance of the profound system
I had excogitated before reaching my one-and-twentieth
year.</p>

<p>As to religion, I had none, in the vulgar sense of
the word. I repudiated the idea of a personal deity,
as contrary to the nature of an infinite and eternal
Existence. As to the destinies of the soul or primitive
atom, I saw nothing but an everlasting vista of
progress, and increase of enjoyment. I had ascended
from the abyss, I was soaring into the empyrean. I
had been perchance a stone, a plant, a fish, an insect,
a bird, and a mammal. I was now a man, I might
be an angel, a god, a Kosmos; there was no bound to
imagination, nor limit to reality. In the Eternal
Infinite there was space for all things. The stars
might perish in old age, the whole present occupants
of the stage of being vanish in the storms of change,
but I and all the other indestructible, indivisible
atoms of the measureless whole, could never escape
from Existence. Eternal space was our abode, and
there was no escape from the eternal.</p>

<p>Thus I have given you a vague glimpse of the
deepest depths of my unfathomable thoughts. Let
us now return from the subtle abstractions of philosophy,
to the embodied forms and images of human
life. Henceforward I shall speak of things as they
appear, and leave the more difficult science of essential
analysis to those of my readers who care to
investigate such mysteries.</p>

<p>I will merely add, that in love I recognised the
highest spiritual potence, and in the mystery of sex,
the grand motive power of Nature's atomic citizens.</p>

<p>Up to this time, I had still vaguely dreamed of
Rosalie, although I narrowly escaped a second serious
passion (from which, however, I recovered after a
precipitate declaration and very natural rejection).
But it was only a dream, a hope. The Destinies were
eager to overthrow the edifice of pride, which the
last two years had built up.</p>

<p>The day of my majority arrived. I had creditors
like any other young man of pleasure. But what
matter? I had reversionary property to the value
of thousands of pounds. I could discount the
future, sacrifice large prospects for immediate independence!</p>

<p>Delicious illusion! On examination of the will of
my grandfather, a flaw in my title was discovered.
My reversionary possessions were, perhaps, unsaleable,
<i>without my father's consent!</i></p>

<p>I trembled at my danger.  A horrible presentiment
of my crushed and blighted future, darkened my
soul like a thunder cloud. Already I knew that to
live by literature alone in London, was for a young
aspirant, like myself, a hideous experiment, a chance
game, against the most hazardous odds. Authors
swarmed; the magazines were overwhelmed with
contributors, competing for their miserable <i>honoraria</i>.
I had, it is true, written books, conquered the
attention of readers, and sowed the seeds of a
reputation. But the railway panic deadened the sale
of my last book, as of every other published at the
time. Money was scarce. The publisher, growing
timid, demanded to see the whole MS. of my next
work, before making any advances. Alas! I had
written no work, but my grand system of "Atomic
Individualism" in the shape of a long blank verse
poem, and when I showed it to <i>the</i> philosophic publisher
by speciality, he glanced at one of its pages,
and within the space of two minutes and three
quarters, delivered himself of the following opinion:</p>

<p>"This is a string of mere assumptions, sir."</p>

<p>I have heard some fine criticism in my time.
Eight years later&mdash;only the other day&mdash;I met a
young gentleman in Wall street, who did me the
honor to tell me that one of my most artistical
compositions was "fair, very fair," in his, young
Wall Street's, opinion. I thanked him humbly for his
patronage of my modest muse, though I confess I
shivered a little at his further proposition, that we
should spend an evening in the mutual enjoyment of
one another's society.</p>

<p>Authors have to practise patience, more than even
money-lenders. The currency of ideas is even less
understood than the currency of barter.</p>

<p>My father was abroad. I sacrificed a smaller
reversion, by way of a stop-gap, and started a
magazine, besides printing at my own expense,
a most abominably bad poem, entitled,

<div class="center">

<p>"BORIANNA,"<br/>

A Tale of Ancient Nineveh,</p>

</div>

<p>or something of the kind.</p>

<p>My invisible friend, the famous poet, wrote me his
<i>candid</i> opinion, and <i>that</i> candid operation, I blush
to say, terminated our correspondence for several
years. Not that I was vain enough to feel offended
at his utter condemnation of my poem, but that I
thought he need not have damned it so <i>utterly</i>, since
the verses were at least correct and melodious. But
the poet was a Scotchman, and did his duty as a
friend, like a Brutus. My after difficulties were

the real cause of my ceasing to write, either to the
poet, or to any one else with whom I was in correspondence.
Even Lady &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; was neglected, till
her patience gave way, and she wrote through a
friend, for the return of a tale, forwarded for my
magazine. I had not used the tale, from a scruple
of delicacy, foreseeing the probable catastrophe of
that periodical and its editor.</p>

<p>My father returned. I told him the difficulty&mdash;he
was marble. I entreated his signature&mdash;he was
iron. I besought his pity for the utter ruin of all
my prospects, the destruction of my whole scheme
of ambition and hope in life&mdash;he was adamant.</p>

<p>He would do nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;absolutely nothing.
Yes, he would give me a small stipend&mdash;perhaps
even a hundred pounds a year, if I would
return to the profession of the law, and (as far as
possible), abandon literature.</p>

<p>I yielded for the moment to necessity; but as my
father sternly refused to pay one farthing of my
debts, it was too late for economy. One morning
before I rose, the servant tapped at my bed-room
door.</p>

<p>"Sir, Captain Smith is waiting to see you."</p>

<p>"Who is Captain Smith I wonder?" thought I,
as I jumped out of bed; "ah! Smith, perhaps, of the
H&mdash;&mdash;n service. Everybody knows a Captain Smith."</p>

<p>The name of Smith suggests a reminiscence.
Walking one day in a street in a Western city, I
saw a beautiful girl at a window. Impelled by
curiosity; and hoping to get an excuse to see her
more closely, I knocked at the door, and for want of
something to say inquired if Miss Smith lived there.</p>

<p>"Sir," said a middle-aged lady who came to the
door, "I <i>am</i> Miss Smith."</p>

<p>Now had she <i>not</i> been Miss Smith I was fully
prepared with apology, inquiry and various means
of prolonging the conversation. As it was, I was
for the moment taken aback. It was only by a
prodigious effort that I invented the safety valve.</p>

<p>"Miss Rowena Alexandrina Smith?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, Miss Mary Smith."</p>

<p>And so our interview terminated by my saying,
"Ah! I beg your pardon, it was Miss Alexandrina
Rowena Smith I wanted; pray excuse me."</p>

<p>In these latter days I might have suspected a
snare in the early visit of a man with so popular a
name. But at one and twenty, one suspects nothing.</p>

<p>I dressed, entered my sitting-room, and found
reading the paper an utter stranger. He was a well-dressed
man with sandy whiskers, of medium height
and easy manner.</p>

<p>"Captain Smith?" said I.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes sir," said the stranger courteously, "we
always like to do these things quietly&mdash;on account of
the servants. The fact is, I have come to arrest you,
to take your body, sir, in legal phrase&mdash;at the suit of
Mr. Roller, the printer."</p>

<p>"Who <i>are</i> you then?"</p>

<p>"Oh I, sir? I'm a sheriff's officer; my name is
Jacobs."</p>

<p>"Very well," said I "I suppose I can breakfast
first."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir."</p>

<p>"I shall be able to pay the bill in the course
of the day," I added, with an off-hand air, and still
lingering feeling of a grand seigneur to whom such
a trifle as fifty pounds could not possibly be a difficulty.</p>

<p>"No doubt, sir," said Captain Smith, otherwise
Jacobs, with apparent conviction.</p>

<p>"Since the writ was served, I really forgot to
attend to it," said I, "but it is a mere accident."</p>

<p>"Nothing more, of course," said Jacobs; "a
gentleman like yourself would of course never leave
a bill unpaid&mdash;except by accident. And now, sir, if
you please, I'll bring up my man Sloker whose time
is not so valuable as mine, and he will wait till you
breakfast, and then be at your disposal."</p>

<p>"Very well, bring up Sloker," said I, feeling a
strange novelty in my position.</p>

<p>Sloker came up. He was a short, stout man, of
immensely broad and heavy build, with a red-face,
small eyes, pug-nose, top boots, a thick stick, in short,
the bum-bailiff of tradition in high perfection.</p>

<p>Sloker introduced, Jacobs vanished with a bow.</p>

<p>"Sloker," said I, when I had finished my breakfast,
"suppose I were to knock you down with the
fire-poker (and an English poker is a formidable
weapon) and then walk off and become invisible?"</p>

<p>"Captain Frosterville tried that 'ere game," said
Sloker, a little appalled at my cool proposition, "and
vot wus the consekuns? <i>vy</i>, 'e wus <i>trans</i>ported as a
fellun!"</p>

<p>As Sloker thought that statement of fact conclusive,
I said no more, but put a few things in a carpet
bag, and sending for a cab, bid the man carry the
bag down-stairs, and preceded him in the descent.</p>

<p>I could not imagine that my relatives would allow
me to remain an hour in prison for debt. Otherwise,
I might have saved a world of suffering, by bribing
Sloker to let me escape, and keeping out of the way
till my creditors were pacified. But it was destined
that I should learn at one blow, what vile stuff the
world is made of.</p>

<p>I was taken to a sponging-house, thence to a prison.
I found myself for the first time in my life, in
the society of a miscellaneous rabble; ranging from
the "broken-down swell," as in slang phrase the
prisoners called any luckless member of the "upper
ten," who, like myself, found his way <i>by accident</i> to
those regions, down to cab-drivers, barbers, and petty
traders of all kinds.</p>

<p>A hideous sense of degradation, horror, rage and
disgust filled my whole being, when I found myself
utterly abandoned by all my relatives, friends and
acquaintances. A foreign servant, dependent upon
me, was my only visitor, with the exception of those
who were too poor to aid me. The old exiled,
impoverished and one-armed Marquis d'A&mdash;&mdash;, once
commander of the forces in C&mdash;&mdash;a; Colonel T&mdash;&mdash;,
a literary as well as military veteran, and a publisher
who had in his possession a small MS. Satire on the
Satirists of the Day, from my pen, were the only
friends of better days who came to the prison.</p>

<p>Bivar was absent, on a visit to Scotland.</p>

<p>For week after week I lingered in this horrible den
of misfortune, with difficulty raising the means of
living, by allowing my man to sell books, pictures,
and other valuables. Even that resource was
stopped, as all my furniture, &amp;c., was seized by the
landlord, when he saw that I was in difficulties. At
length, I wrote to my sister, who was married to a
rich man, and had herself property in expectancy,
like myself. She obtained the money for my release,
and extorted a promise from my father to allow me a
regular income. Once more I was at liberty.</p>

<p>Carpet bag in hand&mdash;for I had discharged my servant,
who had besides robbed me&mdash;I quitted the
detested precincts of the city, and hastened towards
one of the principal thoroughfares. I felt as one in
a dream; men, horses, omnibuses, all swam before
my eyes; the streets looked bright and gaudy like
the scenery of a pantomime, after the gloom of the
stone yard of the prison, surrounded by high buildings,
and almost impervious to the sun.</p>

<p>My furniture was sold, my books, papers, even my
clothes were detained, under pretext of a balance due
to my landlord. I was utterly destitute. I had little
more than a change of linen, and my income was
fixed at four dollars a week (fifteen shillings sterling),
by my noble father, who, without spending or sacrificing
a cent, could, by merely signing his name, put
me in possession of a fortune which, after all, <i>was</i>
mine, and which eventually I <i>proved</i> to be mine by
the best of all possible proofs, viz. by <i>selling</i> it.</p>

<p>He did not <i>dare</i> to leave me to starve, though his
unnatural hatred, fostered by his wife (of whom I
had incautiously spoken, with the contempt she
merited) would, have gladly driven me to suicide,
and thus been rid of my mother's representative and
possible avenger.</p>

<p>Finding myself alone, without friends, consolation,
or resources, my spirit broken by the humiliations of
my position, my health injured by imprisonment and
want of air and exercise, and my mind weakened by
previous over exertion, I yielded to the violence of
the shock; and when a letter to my grandmother
remained unanswered, and the landlady, at the end
of two weeks, began to persecute me for the rent of
a small room I had taken; when, moreover, owing to
my actual inability to see distress without relieving
it, and a poor "prison-acquaintance," yet worse off
than myself, I actually learned what it was to <i>want
food</i> at times&mdash;I fairly gave way to Destiny, and
deliberately swallowed a large dose of laudanum in
the hope of escaping all further misery.</p>

<p>By a sort of miracle, the poison refused to destroy.
I woke in the morning, was very sick, and recovered.
But the effect remained, not of the laudanum, but of
that terrible and profound sentiment of despair,
which must animate the human heart, before it can
attain to so supreme a resolution as that of self-destruction.</p>

<p>For twelve months the equilibrium of my mind
was disturbed&mdash;my usual courage was weakened.
I roamed dreamily about, avoiding all society. I
called on none of my former acquaintances. I disappeared
utterly from the eyes of my acquaintance.
I vegetated miserably. In my deep sadness, I
became indifferent to food; a little bread, butter and
fruit sufficed for my nutriment. I wrote nothing. I
read but with a feeble, dreamy indifference. My
literary ambition seemed dead, my self-confidence
destroyed.</p>

<p>But I was young. One day I woke up, I asked
my father for some necessary furniture, of which his
large house was full to superfluity. I took suitable
apartments in a suburb of London, and resolved
to&mdash;turn schoolmaster. In my bitter misanthropy, I
preferred a life of simple obscurity, to the trials and
ambitions of a world which I despised.</p>

<p>I issued cards&mdash;well I recollect with what difficulty
I spared the few shillings I paid for printing them&mdash;I
obtained by degrees a few pupils, who at "The
Classical and Commercial Academy of Mr. D.
Mondel, member of the Universities of &amp;c., were
instructed in Latin, Greek, Arithmetic, &amp;c. N. B.
Drawing, French, German, Italian and Spanish,
<i>extra!</i>"</p>

<p>The last item I considered rather a good idea, as I
was, of course, my own drawing-master, as well as
professor of modern languages.</p>

<p>The son of the neighboring milkman, of the
barber, of the confectioner, the washerwoman and
the green-grocer were amongst my pupils, and I
thus was chiefly paid in kind. Unfortunately the
baker had no son. However, I <i>lived</i>, and with a
certain savage pride. Sometimes I thought of John
Milton and Dionysius Tyrannus. I ate opium,
inhaled ether, and strolled about dreaming. In the
eyes of the vulgar I was a very strange personage,
especially since one day I picked up a dying beggar
on the threshold of a rich nobleman's villa, and
walked, supporting him on my arm, through the
main street, till I finally gave him into charge of the
parish authorities, with stern injunctions to relieve
his necessities forthwith.</p>

<p>My greatest torture in these years of horrible
poverty, for my rent absorbed nearly all my little
annuity, was the appeals of the poor whom I was
unable to assist.</p>

<p>Oh! the bitterness and the wild hopes that
animated me when I beheld the sufferings of the
poor in London! when I beheld the atrocious meanness,
the base ignoble selfishness of the rich!</p>

<p>Sometimes in my dreams I heard the measured
tramp of thousands, and found myself riding at the
head of a mighty army into the great city of corruption&mdash;a
second Cromwell with a greater purpose
and a sterner will. Then I woke in a cold perspiration&mdash;the
poor, half-starved schoolmaster, who <i>fancied</i>
that he had once seen the society of the great and
the beautiful a long, long time ago&mdash;perhaps in a
former life or in another planet.</p>

<p>Then I said to myself, these English lords and
gentlemen, and merchants and scholars, are only fit
to be destroyed utterly for their cruel murders of
the working man&mdash;murder by inches, murder by
starvation!</p>

<p>I became familiar with the pawnbrokers, to
whom, having at length recovered my books and
papers, I carried volume after volume, from my
rapidly diminishing library. At length, all my books
were gone, but the presents of youth, of college
friends, keepsakes, and souvenirs. Hunger drove
me to part with these at length, and poverty
allowed the time fixed to elapse, so that they all
were lost. Of all my books, there remained only a
Latin dictionary, a Greek Lexicon, Grammars of the
two dead languages, a Lempri&egrave;re's Classical Dictionary;
a Bible given me by my mother, which I still
preserve, and one or two German books, of no
salable value.</p>

<p>It was the workman selling his tools, but keeping
a hammer and chisel, a saw and a gimblet, till the
last. I now became a political agitator. I hoped
for a revolution. I saw so much injustice, suffering,
and neglect of the working classes, that I cared not
what change took place. It could but benefit the
people. I harangued the Chartists at some of their
meetings, but my soul sank within me, when I saw
what a set of crushed and spirit-broken men I proposed
to lead. Oh! had I then had money, only a
single thousand pounds (!) how much I could have
done amongst men who were so miserably poor, by
even the smallest signs of liberality&mdash;paying the
hire of a hall, for example; but I had nothing but
eloquence and reason, and they were not reasonable.
They expected the impossible, they expected <i>victory
without fighting</i>.</p>

<p>Still, with a small sum of ready money; I think
that on the outbreak of the French revolution in
1848, I could have upset the British Government, by
a rise in the metropolis. As it was, there was
more danger of such an event, than people supposed.
As for the subsequent meeting of the Chartists, on
Kensington Common, it was a mere farce. All was
prepared for resistance. But in February, 1848, the
thing <i>might</i> have been done by bold men, by a
<i>coup-de-main</i>, and once <i>done</i>, with a strong arm at
the helm, the <i>middle class</i> would have <i>accepted</i>
it. But my utter poverty crippled all possibility of
action; and I have ever been too proud to beg subscriptions,
even for the cause of humanity, or to
intrigue to ally myself with richer men, for the
purpose of using their means.</p>

<p>On the day that the news arrived of Louis
Philippe's fall, a cab stopped at my door. Unusual
event! the scholars were amazed. Out jumped a
gentleman, a publisher. He wanted me to translate
an important work from the French, with all possible
speed. It was a book of two hundred small
duodecimo pages. He offered me five pounds&mdash;twenty-five
dollars, to translate it in a fortnight. I
accepted. I translated several other books for this
man. He paid me as well as he could, but he was
poor himself, and had his family to consider before
his creditors. He is like nearly every publisher I
ever dealt with&mdash;still in my debt.</p>

<p>Let me now pass rapidly over two more years of
perpetual struggle, poverty, and suffering. Bivar
returned and engaged a room in the same house with
me. I dismissed my scholars, and relapsed into the
professional author. Now, indeed, I was a true Slave
of the Lamp. Bivar and I made common cause, but
with all our efforts, we lived irregularly, fared badly,
and were often almost in rags, as to costume.</p>

<p>I should be sorry to write down all the bitter feelings
which the mere mortification of not being able
to get proper clothes, induces in the mind of a born
gentleman in England. How often, when some well-dressed
puppy passed me, the poor threadbare poet,
with a side-glance in the street, have I muttered dark
and awful anathemas on the brutal selfishness of my
pitiful relatives. Not to <i>feel</i> was impossible, because
we know the effect of appearances on the mind, but
my feelings were not of shame, but of wrath and
contempt for the meanness and baseness of mankind.</p>

<p>One day, a dandy on horseback nearly rode over
me, as he emerged from a doorway. Striking his
horse on the forehead with my clenched hand, I commanded
him to draw back while I passed, or I
would speak to his master to discharge him. This
pretence of mistaking him for a groom, displeased
my gentleman, who made some muttered reply, in
which I caught the words "whips and insolence."
I stopped his horse, and said to him calmly, but with
the feelings of a devil&mdash;"Sir, were you ever torn
from your horse, rolled in the mire, trampled and
spit upon?&mdash;No! then utter one word, look at me
impertinently, and you will enjoy that novel experience."</p>

<p>When the man had left me, which he did in
silence, for after all, he was, perhaps, only some rich
shopkeeper, who liked horses, and in England all
shopkeepers are cowards, I still trembled with agitation.
My mind was diseased, I was fierce and
dangerous as a famished wolf. A dun forced himself
into my study, and said he would stay there till he
was paid. I threw him down-stairs, after warning
him gravely of my intention. Bivar laughed when
he came in, and heard of the incident. The people
in the house thought me mad. If anything is calculated
to drive a proud and honorable man mad, it is
pecuniary embarrassment and petty miseries.</p>

<p>Bivar and I now had made the acquaintance of
many young artists and authors, mostly as poor
as ourselves. We wrote and drew for a comic
paper, which paid well enough, but which, as it
had to support half the rising talent in London,
could not give a very large slice to individuals.
Bivar and I were also, in a manner, intruders, and
had not been originally connected with the affair.
However, the devil-may-care young editors gave us
what space they could, and eventually, I attended
the funeral of the paper, as editor, and mourner-in-chief,
having in its latter days, occasionally
written the whole paper, and drawn the caricatures
into the bargain, during Bivar's absence in the
country.</p>

<p>I had moved into the heart of London, and now
occupied chambers, as they are called, in an Inn of
court. These chambers are like offices, quite independent,
and taken on lease like separate tenements.
My rooms were naturally on the third floor, which
happened to be the highest.</p>

<p>There, in utter solitude and desolation, I lived and
wrote, and studied, boiling my own potatoes, and
making my own tea; meditating grand poems,
philosophical treatises, tales, novels, dramas, and all
kinds of fantastic creations, whole boxes of which,
in embryo, are probably still mouldering in the cellar
of the inn. But except Bivar, no one saw in me
anything but a man who had seen better days, and
written books; who was very poor, and very gloomy.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, Mondel, you are one of the great
unappreciated!" said a brilliant young writer whose
imitative faculty rendered him more easily successful
as a journalist and magazinist.</p>

<p>What had this boy <i>done</i> that he should thus speak
to me, who, at the age of four and twenty, in
one way or other, had already produced more
than a dozen volumes? I reflected impatiently.
But a second reflection calmed me. He was
right. I was unappreciated, because I expected
credit for the inward power, not for the external
deed. I immediately resolved to write a new work,
and threw my whole soul into its composition. I
found a young publisher, who was not afraid of new
ideas, and in fact, was glad to catch an author of
even my celebrity. A bargain was struck&mdash;I was
to receive a per centage on the work, and a small&mdash;a
<i>very</i> small, advance; for the publisher was poor
and himself a practical printer.</p>

<p>During these three years of purgatory, from which
I now began somewhat to emerge, having renewed
my wardrobe, and become a more dextrous financier,
I had of course, had many slight flirtations of
a more or less fleeting character, but love&mdash;divine
love&mdash;had been as it were, exorcised by the angel
of sorrow. My mind had been too much absorbed
in gloomy meditation, and anxious care, to dwell
perseveringly on the still slumbering Ideal. Beside,
I lived alone, and made no female acquaintances
of a suitable kind.</p>

<p>One day, I had just written the last sentence of
my new prose version of the "<i>Atomic Individulism</i>,"
as it is now printed, and condemned the
long poem to eternal oblivion, when there was a
tap at my door, "some one gently tapping&mdash;tapping
at my chamber door&mdash;merely this, and nothing
more."</p>

<p>I opened the door, a young girl of sixteen to seventeen
years, beautiful as a dream, entered. She
brought me a letter of no importance, but she
brought me herself, a matter of great importance.<p>

<p>Organization is the handwriting of Nature, the
emblem of the soul. We love types. The moment
we see a sufficiently near approximation to the type
within us, we love it.</p>

<p>I loved the fair stranger at the first glance. For a
second time, but with far greater power, I felt that
thrill which love, real love only can inspire. At four
and twenty the passions have a far grander movement
than at seventeen. We are not less intoxicated
perhaps, but far more deeply shaken.</p>

<p>This charming visitor appeared to me like a dove
bearing the olive branch of Hope to my tempest-tossed
ark, after a deluge of sorrows.</p>

<p>She was not really tall, but she looked so, from the
fine proportions of her figure. She was beautiful&mdash;would
you know <i>how</i> beautiful; imagine a somewhat
less dazzling reflection of Columbia, with hazel eyes
instead of ethereal blue, and a mien somewhat less
imperially graceful, standing like a Greek statue,
self-posted, calm, unconscious of the effect she was
producing, and you see the fair stranger before you
as I then beheld her.</p>

<p>I inquired the name of this heavenly messenger.</p>

<p>"Blanche D'Arcy."</p>

<p>I repeated the name to myself with delight. In
young girls and poets Nature still speaks. We
looked and loved. A few confused words, a hasty
kiss, a pressure of the hand, and Blanche glided
away like a shadow, leaving me happy&mdash;yes happy,
for the first time in my life!</p>

<p>So happy did I feel, that I could not believe my
happiness. I had been hitherto, even in my more
prosperous days so unutterably miserable from the
fierce craving for affection that consumed my soul,
amid fictitious mockeries of pleasure! And now
was it possible that in one hour the misery of a life
had been remedied? I hardly dared to believe. Yet
to-morrow came and I with it. Blanche came again,
and from day to day our love grew, and our happiness
was almost without spec.</p>

<p>Blanche was the daughter of a dramatic author
and poet, who had neither accomplished anything as
a writer, nor in any other line, and who had allowed
his youngest daughter to grow up wild as it were,
like the flowers on the heath or in the forest. But
Blanche was a genius in her way, and I have never
heard anything more fascinating than her stories of
her childhood; passed like Annabel Lee's, "in a city
by the sea." One of them I will record in her own
words.</p>

<p>"You must know, dearest, that at one time I was
in the habit of giving all my pocket-money to a poor
old beggar who stood on the Marine Parade. I could
not resist him, he was so old and looked so very poor.
Very shortly after, papa became poor himself, that is
very much troubled, so that we had scarcely bread to
eat at home on some days. But we let no one know
how poor we were. Still, I outgrew my dresses, and
mamma took opium, and papa had no money to buy
me new ones, so that I no longer looked like a young
lady, but quite like a poor workman's child. One
day I passed the beggar, and said, 'How sorry I am
that I have nothing to give you!' Then the beggar
said, 'Oh, my dear young lady, what is the matter?
you do not look so well dressed as you did; has any
misfortune happened to your parents?' 'Yes,' said
I, 'papa's eyes are grown weak, and we are not so
rich as we were,' and I wished to go away. But
the beggar held my arm, and said, 'My dear child,
I am not so poor as I look. Say nothing, you were
always good to me, and I wish to show my gratitude.'
And the old man took out a bright piece of gold&mdash;a
half-sovereign I think&mdash;and tried to force it into my
hand!"</p>

<p>"And what did you do, Blanche?" said I.</p>

<p>"Who, I?" resumed Blanche, "I cried out, '<i>What!</i>
take money from a beggar! Oh, no, my dear old
friend, never!' And I ran away as fast as I could.
But when I grew older I often thought of the incident,
and I don't know why, but the tears always
come into my eyes when I do."</p>

<p>"Blanche," said I, "you are a little angel."</p>

<p>And so things went on, and we became all to one
another that man can be to woman or woman to
man. Blanche had no conventional ideas, whatever.
She was absolutely a child of nature. We were to
be formally married, however, on a day agreed upon
between us. My book was completely printed and
published. I had provided Blanche with an outfit
and a wedding dress. All was arranged; when, by
one of the most infernal conspiracies ever formed,
originating in the jealousy of her elder sister, and a
young female friend, the daughter of a relative
with whom Blanche lived, our whole scheme of
life and happiness was overthrown as by an earthquake.</p>

<p>In an insane fit of jealousy I had an interview
with Blanche, who had been goaded into an equally
insane fit of pride. Without any explanation, without
alluding to details, which seemed to us beneath
our dignity to discuss, we each assumed positions
from which neither would descend. I insisted;
Blanche defied; and we parted the very day before
that fixed for our marriage, the victims of a few
ingenious lies and of our own unreasonable pride.</p>

<p>"Have the extreme kindness, sir," said Blanche,
"to light me down stairs."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Madam, I forgot that the gas was not
lit," I replied, as with studied politeness, I escorted
her to the bottom of the staircase.</p>

<p>"You know best," said Bivar, who was present
at the interview, but&mdash;he shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>Never, indeed had Blanche looked more lovely
than on that fatal occasion. The unfortunate cause
of the whole catastrophe, also accompanied Blanche.</p>

<p>Thus we had each our second, or as the French
say witness, in this duel of almost incredible folly,
and it is with a shudder that I recall, how when
Blanche requested to speak with me, alone in the
adjoining room, I answered coldly, "all we have
to say, can be as well said here!"</p>

<p>The presence of others prevented all possibility of
a true explanation. Altogether, I am amazed that
such a scene could have occurred, and been regarded
by us, as final. Yet, so it was. Blanche indeed
returned to unveil the conspiracy of our enemies,
but it was too late. I had left the chambers for
ever, and given no clue to my abode.</p>

<p>It happened thus. Spurning from me the more
than hinted propositions of Blanche's perfidious
friend (a young and pretty young girl, who subsequently
married an actor, and died of consumption
in the same year), I immediately left the hated
scene of so much happiness, now lost to me for
ever, and resolved to sell my estate in reversion,
at all hazards, for whatever I could obtain, were
it only a single hundred pounds, with which, to
give a last grand supper to my literary comrades,
and drug my last goblet with prussic acid, by
way of a suitable finale.</p>

<p>Bivar and I took roomy lodgings in a pleasant
suburb, where we were attended on as at an hotel.
Bivar's father advanced me some money, till my
negotiations were concluded, and Bivar himself
suddenly determined to start for New York, and
seek his fortunes in America. Thus, I was left to
the society of my only other confidential friend,
Peregrine Cope, an American editor, orator, and
man of letters, then in London. For some months, he
and I struggled on together, both terribly embarrassed
in our circumstances, when I effected a
sale of a share of my property, at a sacrifice of
at least six sevenths of its real value, and within
forty-eight hours, Cope and I were in the capital of
the then Republic of France, one and indivisible,
declaring that after all, there was only one city in
the world, and that was Paris.</p>

<p>But though I never alluded to the subject, the
pale spectre of Blanche D'Arcy, haunted me like
a crime. I was restless, irritable, morbid. Cope
could scarcely endure my caprices.</p>

<p>Let me now sum up briefly, the next two years
of my life.</p>

<p>Though not entirely idle, for I published my system
of philosophy, and wrote many articles which were
well paid for, and highly appreciated by first-class
periodicals, I devoted myself, mainly, to a
restless pursuit of excitement. The three years of
poverty, and the loss of my beautiful Blanche,
had left me in a state of misanthropy and despair. I
now believed in, hoped in nothing. I felt like a
man without a future. I associated with rich young
men, and rivalled them in their extravagant dissipations.
My reversionary thousands, dwindled down
into hundreds when realized, disappeared one after
the other, with an alarming rapidity. Still, I
plunged on, I was like a man falling in a dream.</p>

<p>One morning, I awoke in a handsome villa, which
I rented with a fair Rosamond, whom I did not
love, and servants to provide for, and with empty
purse. To hope to maintain such expenses by
writing for magazines or papers, was preposterous,
and I had just failed in getting a purchaser for
my last remnant of reversion. I was used up
mentally and pecuniarily. I had no inducement
to live; I did not love my supposed wife in the
least. It had been a union of caprice and recklessness,
and on my part, at least, resulted in perfect
indifference. In fact, I was tired of the whole life.
So, unsatisfactory as it was to die in the prime of
manhood, and perhaps on the verge of fame, I
very quietly made up my mind to get up, dress,
load my pistols, and blow my brains out.</p>

<p>What else could I do with expenses, say at least
some four or five hundred pounds a year, and not a
penny in possession or prospect? The case seemed
to me clear, and my resolution was taken. As
for applying again to my rich relatives, it did not even
occur to me.</p>

<p>A miracle again saved me. The servant knocked
at the door and handed in a card, saying that a lady
was below, and wished to see me.</p>

<p>"A lady!" I looked at the card. It was that of
my sister, whom I had not seen for four years!</p>

<p>One month from that time I had got rid of my
establishment, was separated from my fair but uncongenial
friend, had chambers in the best part of
London newly furnished, and a hundred pounds at
my bankers! Thanks to my noble sister, all this had
been accomplished. Her love inspired me with new
energy, my capitalist <i>had</i>, after all, advanced me the
funds I required, and the new magazine which I had
started, was going on well. I might yet have succeeded
in retrieving my fortune in England.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the moment I was not actually
employed, the old gloom and disgust of life returned.
I was walking past Trafalgar Square, a day or two
after my instalment in my new abode, when a
woman's hand was laid gently on my arm. I turned
impatiently; and saw a pale lady in black, instead of
the person I anticipated.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," I said, "I really do not"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not remember me?" said a voice that vibrated
to my inmost soul. It was Blanche D'Arcy.</p>

<p>"Walk with me," said Blanche, with dignity, "I
wish to speak to you. I am no longer a child."</p>

<p>In truth she was now a beautiful woman&mdash;though
looking unutterably sorrowful and care-worn.</p>

<p>We walked together towards my house. She
unravelled the whole mystery of our quarrel, and
explained the base deceptions of which we were the
victims.</p>

<p>I begged Blanche to enter. We sat down, at a
great distance from one another, on either side of the
fireplace. We were grave and polite.</p>

<p>"O Blanche!" I exclaimed, "if you had but
known how much I loved you!"</p>

<p>"<i>Loved?</i>" said Blanche.</p>

<p>In that one word she said more than could be
expressed in hours. The next moment she was in
my arms.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Blanche," I cried, "let us be married at once!"</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> married," said Blanche sadly; "I have been
married nearly two years. I married in despair; I
have since repented. My husband and I are separated."</p>

<p>"For what cause?"</p>

<p>"Because I found that I could not endure his
society."</p>

<p>"Is he old?"</p>

<p>"Twenty two."</p>

<p>"Good looking?"</p>

<p>"He is considered to be so. He is very successful
with women."</p>

<p>"Does he love you?"</p>

<p>"He adores me."</p>

<p>"And you?"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I cannot endure him near me. I do not love
him. I&mdash;&mdash;I loathe him! I cannot account for it.
So it is. Dudley! my <i>heart</i> has been true to you."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

</div>

<p>Consumption! horrible scourge of love and beauty
and hope! I cannot, dare not, trace its progress.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

</div>

<p>Blanche died in my arms.</p>

<p>I buried her with my last remaining money.</p>

<p>I was alone, penniless, lost; yet I had not yet found
the happiness I sought&mdash;a great, an <i>equal</i> love. Poor
Blanche was but a child. I loved her and nursed
her&mdash;cherished her. She looked up to me as a
woman, though she had braved me as a child. But
I still had a dream, a secret image of a goddess,
whose intelligence, as well as feeling, should harmonize
with my own. This indefinite longing revived
after the first storm of grief was over. Yet, once
more I owed my life to an accident. In a moment
of despair at my loss, I was about to form a desperate
resolution, when a letter from Bivar was given me.</p>

<p>A trifle now decided my destiny; I resolved to
rake together the necessary sum and start for
America at once. All social and conventional considerations
were now with me as wind. I made no
attempt to realize my remaining property. I
embarked on board a sailing vessel, as a second
cabin passenger, with ten pounds in my purse, and
as outfit just what was absolutely necessary. A
thirty days' voyage landed me in New York, where
Bivar received me with open arms. Of the rest of
my doings, I need not speak. I have travelled and
seen the new land of my adoption. I have lived by
my pen, my pencil, and my invention, as becomes a
gentleman and a poet. Men call me eccentric, fools
whisper that I am insane. Let my <i>work</i> speak for
me, as it constantly does in reviews, magazines,
papers, from Florida to the British Provinces, and
from New York to San Francisco. But of one thing
feel certain, the hardships which I have endured as
a <i>Slave of the Lamp</i> in this land, are little inferior
to my worst days in England. It is true, I am <i>now</i>
too old and too sensible to go without a dinner.  But
short of that, New York is as hard a step-mother for
poets as London or Paris! Some day I will hope to
fill up the outline so lightly traced in these hasty
pages.</p>

<p>Such, O, peerless Columbia! is a brief and imperfect
outline of my life. In it I have dwelt little on
my numerous literary labors; also omitted many
details which might have added apparent consistency
to the narrative. Such as it is, it is <i>true</i>.
You now know me to some extent as I <i>am</i>. Whilst others
around you wear the mask of conventional hypocrisy,
I stand before you as one who has loved and suffered,
who still loves and suffers, a victim to the <i>Fate</i>
which has implanted in his soul the instinct to seek
for the highest beauty and noblest happiness upon
earth.</p>

<p>Farewell! divinely beautiful and dear, too dear,
Columbia. I have been rejected, perhaps condemned
justly&mdash;yet would I be judged as I am,
not as I seem, and by the law of reason and nature;
not by that of cant and preconceived morality.</p>

<p>Once more farewell&mdash;if successful in my enterprise
I shall return ere many months are past.
Adored Columbia, farewell&mdash;farewell!</p>

<p>(Signed)<br/>

MONDEL.</p>

<p>When Columbia had finished the perusal of these
strange confessions, she meditated long and gravely
over their contents.</p>

<p>"Strange man! strange man!" she murmured;
and again, and again, she perused certain passages
in the memoir of this second Rousseau, who, from
the vulgar point of view&mdash;a spendthrift, a libertine,
a reckless desperado, was, philosophically regarded&mdash;a
strong spirit at war with prejudice and conventional
slavery.</p>

<p>It might be that his excessive pride glossed over
his vices and weaknesses in his descriptions; and it
was perfectly plain that he had at various periods led
anything but a respectable and saintly existence. It
was also evident that he neglected his literary life to
dwell upon his active and passional existence. But,
in fact, Columbia was familiar with Mondel's poems
and works, and now that his memoir furnished the
key, she took deeper glimpses into the dark abysses
of his nature, and its fiery intensity of volition, than
she had yet attempted.</p>

<p>"And he is gone!" murmured Columbia,  "he is
gone&mdash;perhaps for ever! Oh, why did I not receive
this package one day before the vessel sailed,&mdash;one
single day!"</p>

<p id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI.</p>

<p>MISFORTUNES.</p>

</div>

<p>AS villages are oft-times crushed by the fall of
an avalanche, so whole families are desolated by the
volcanic eruption of calamities, which, unforeseen
and irresistible, overwhelm the fated victims.
To-day they were with us; to-morrow they are
gone, dead, scattered; impoverished by crime, folly,
or insanity.</p>

<p>It was thus with the house of Atreus. Thus
too, the black wings of Destiny flapped noiseless
thunder over the Fifth Avenue palace of Mr.
Yonkers.</p>

<p>Mr. Yonkers has, for some time past, dealt largely
in bullion, besides speculating in stocks to an
enormous extent. His notes were discounted at the
lowest rates. His credit was, in commercial parlance,
A. 1. in the market. Nevertheless, a succession of
losses brought him, in the space of a few months,
to the verge of ruin. At first, he refused to
believe it; but a sudden and pressing demand,
which he had no means to meet, opened his eyes
to a sense of his true, or rather extremely false,
position. His whole complicated system of speculation
was but a huge bubble. One day's delay
in raising the sum required, and the bubble would
burst.</p>

<p>It was at this crisis, that he met his very useful
friend, Mr. Crusher. Mr. Crusher was only known
to Mr. Yonkers, since a very recent date, but their
transactions had been numerous. Mr. Crusher
bought a great deal of bullion of Mr. Yonkers, for
which he paid invariably ready cash, down, and
not by check as was usual. Mr. Crusher was a
singular man, he drove very hard bargains; he
seemed to distrust everybody; he professedly had no
banker, though his pockets were always full of
money. His air of intense assurance was marvellous,
and the few people who knew him, soon
learned to respect him as a man who at any time
could command ten thousand dollars, perhaps a
hundred.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Crusher, the bullion is ready for
you," said Mr. Yonkers, alluding to a large order
given by Mr. Crusher, some days before.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Mr. Crusher, "I will call for
it in an hour, and bring the money with me.
I need not impress upon you once more, that
where political interests are concerned, secresy is
most requisite."</p>

<p>"Nuff sed," said Mr. Yonkers, with a feeble
attempt at jocularity; "by the way, have you
any money to spare this morning?"</p>

<p>"How much do you want?" said  Mr.  Crusher.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five thousand dollars," said Mr. Yonkers,
"in bills at one, two, and three months."</p>

<p>"It is a large amount," said  Mr.  Crusher.</p>

<p>"I have just lent fifty thousand on &mdash;&mdash; stocks,"
said Mr. Yonkers.</p>

<p>"Well, you shall have it," said Mr. Crusher,
"that will be one hundred and fifty-thousand dollars,
altogether. I will bring the money, and
take away the bullion in my carriage. You know,
I have no banker, and trust nobody," said Mr.
Crusher, with his diplomatic smile.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Mr. Crusher was in his
office, No. &mdash;&mdash; Wall street.</p>

<p>"I have done it," he cried, throwing off his
assumed manner, and resuming his natural effrontery.
"Slinker, old boy, our fortunes are made.
Here, lock the outer door, and come and help me
to count out the money. One hundred and fifty-thousand!
it is quite a sum to pass off in one
transaction. I guess we shall not do such another
stroke in a hurry."</p>

<p>"But ain't it horful, Confidence?" said the
Slinker, who officiated as the highly demure clerk
of the eccentric capitalist, and possibly, mysterious
political agent, Mr. Crusher.</p>

<p>"Well, it <i>is</i> rather trying to the nerves," said
Bob, "but faint heart never won fair lady; so
go ahead, we must be there in an hour."</p>

<p>Confidence Bob was one of those men who,
though not physically brave, are morally audacious
to a degree scarcely conceivable by more cautious
natures.</p>

<p>The Slinker trembled, but obeyed.</p>

<p>In another hour the triumphant Alterer received
from his two acolytes, one hundred and twenty five
thousand dollars' worth of gold, and the notes of Mr.
Yonkers, which he immediately put in the fire, as if
they had been signed by a mere man of straw, and
not by one of the greatest speculators in New York.
"Here are thirty thousand dollars in real bills," said
Berkeley; "and five thousand in specie. So the
sooner you are both disguised and out of the city
the better."</p>

<p>"But," said Confidence Bob, carefully examining
the bills, given him by Berkeley, "how do I know
that these are good?"</p>

<p>"If you do not know, how can any one else
know?" said the counterfeiter coolly.</p>

<p>"I hope you haint playing horf any tricks on
<i>hus</i>," whispered the Slinker.</p>

<p>"No, no, it is all right," said Berkeley impatiently,
locking up the bullion in an immense iron safe, and
putting the key in his pocket.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, and an old lady in spectacles,
on the arm of a red-haired be-whiskered gentleman,
with an immense fiery moustache, emerged unnoticed
from Berkeley's quiet dwelling, its master having
sent the old negress on an errand, expressly to get rid
of her very limited powers of observation.</p>

<p>The old woman in spectacles was the Slinker.
The tall gentleman with red hair, whiskers and
moustache, was the same identical Confidence Bob,
who so recently figured as the close-cropped and
shaven Mr. Crusher in Wall street. His suit of
immaculate black was exchanged for crossbarred
pantaloons, a light green surtout, a showy waist-coat,
and a colored neck-cloth. His imposingly stiff
shirt collar, was turned down with careless negligence,
a little judicious padding gave him quite a
corpulent air, and a little rouge on his cheeks and nose
so completely destroyed his external identity,
that he might have called straightway on Mr. Yonkers
himself without fear of detection.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the unlucky merchant eagerly conveyed
his pile of forged notes to his bankers,
securely locked up in an iron box.</p>

<p>The next day he was a ruined man&mdash;the forgery
was discovered! It is true, the matter was hushed
up, on account of the universal panic which such a
disclosure might have caused, for it was with a feeling
of unmitigated dismay that all the bankers in the
city recognized the facsimile copies of their own bills.
Of course the office of Mr. Crusher was deserted.</p>

<p>On the evening of the day on which Mr. Yonkers
stopped payment, his wife eloped with John
Berkeley.</p>

<p>Columbia was moreover attacked by a mysterious
illness, which showed more resemblance to a perpetual
state of trance than anything else. She
scarcely ate or drank, never spoke, and appeared
utterly insensible to all external events. This illness
lasted for many weeks. When at length she became
convalescent, and, though bodily weak, spiritually
collected, and capable of clear perception and reflection,
she found her unfortunate father not only a
bankrupt but a drunkard. Always fond of alcoholic
stimulus, Mr. Yonkers, seeing the irremediable confusion
of his affairs, and overcome by his domestic
disgrace and misfortunes, with his daughter apparently
dying before his eyes, took swift and long
strides in the infatuation of a vice from which the
ambition of active pursuits had long partially
protected him. Soon he became unable to bear
existence, save in a state of complete or partial
intoxication, and a few days after leaving his house
in the Fifth Avenue, and removing to a hotel, within
six months of the departure of Mondel and the
elopement of his wife, Mr. Yonkers was attacked by
delirium tremens&mdash;an apoplectic stroke supervened,
and he died miserable; regretted only by his beautiful
and unhappy daughter, who wept in paroxysms
of grief over the body of the only friend she
imagined herself to possess in the world!</p>

<p>Columbia was alone in the world&mdash;alone without
means, and without friends. The once petted
heiress, thanks to her very intellectual superiority
and eccentricity of character, had no intimates of her
own sex. Her father had had no near relatives, and
his conduct previous to his death had alienated his
few business friends, whom old acquaintance induced
to assist him.</p>

<p>There was not a person she knew, to whom
Columbia dared to apply for aid. Latterly her
wretched father had so often requested her to call on
people for him, with requests for loans which he
devoted to his infernal passion, that she felt no
courage to bear any additional humiliation.</p>

<p>One vague hope sustained her&mdash;Mondel might
return&mdash;return once more to throw his great man's
soul and measureless devotion at her feet.</p>

<p>She sold her books and trinkets to pay for her
father's funeral. The landlord of the hotel came to
her, and not only refused to accept payment of his
bill, but offered her a home, so long as she might
require it. The dazzling perfection of her beauty,
the greatness of her misfortunes, excited the deepest
interest. A strange gentleman from the South&mdash;a
young man of brilliantly handsome exterior, called
upon her, and placed his fortune at her disposal, with
the most delicate possible hint, that in due time he
was only too anxious to throw his person into the
bargain. A subscription was even raised by the
ladies in the hotel&mdash;one of the largest and most
fashionable in the city&mdash;and most respectfully presented
to her.</p>

<p>But Columbia, with superb pride, which grief
seemed only to have exalted and intensified, gracefully
but firmly refused all offers of assistance, and
one day, quietly making her way to Mrs. Normer's
house, said simply&mdash;</p>

<p>"Madam, can you take me as a boarder?"</p>

<p>The amiable and pretty face of Mondel's former
landlady was hidden on Columbia's shoulder before
the blonde poetess had half finished the story of her
misfortunes.</p>

<p>"I will try to be a mother to you&mdash;and poor as I
am, whilst I live this house shall be your home,"
said Mrs. Normer, sobbing.</p>

<p>"You  are too young, madam, to be a mother to
me," said Columbia, wiping away Mrs. Normer's
tears, with an exquisite gentleness, "and I am too
proud to be anybody's pensioner. Let me board with
you, and pay the usual price, or I must seek a home
elsewhere."</p>

<p>"As you will," said Mrs. Normer, regarding her
beautiful visitor with unceasing admiration. "By
the way, I must give you Mr. Mondel's rooms.
They are the only ones I have vacant at present."</p>

<p>Columbia trembled and blushed. The idea of
occupying the apartments, of sleeping in the bed,
once occupied by Mondel, was to her a strange and
electrifying thought. She felt as if his spirit might
yet haunt the chambers.</p>

<p>"And what do you propose to do?" said Mrs.
Normer.</p>

<p>"To work," said Columbia.</p>

<p>"To work?"</p>

<p>"I mean to write," sighed the authoress, "to
write for my bread, as hitherto I have written for
my pleasure."</p>

<p>The very next day, Columbia's writing desk was
opened on the very table at which Mondel had
written so many of his wild, soul-stirring compositions.
She sat in the very arm-chair which he had
occupied, and commenced her first magazine article,
with an unconscious quotation from the Slave of the
Lamp, that treasured and often-read manuscript.
But even as she was about to commence, that good
angel, Mrs. Normer, glided slowly into the room, and
laying a small morocco case upon the table, said
gently&mdash;</p>

<p>"A present for you&mdash;which you cannot refuse"&mdash;and
Mrs. Normer vanished almost before Columbia
raised her eyes from her paper.</p>

<p>Mrs. Normer's present was a splendid daguerreotype
of Mondel.</p>

<p>Columbia started with delight. She then gazed
long and earnestly at the grave, sad countenance of
her lover, kissed passionately the glass which
covered it, and murmured pensively&mdash;</p>

<p>"How glad I am that he stole mine from the
drawing-room table!&mdash;I know he took it&mdash;for who
else could it have been?"</p>

<p>"Now let me see," said Columbia; "what shall I
write?&mdash;a love tale? Yes, a tale of happy love!"
and Columbia began to write, and in a few hours
produced a sketch of which she was the heroine, and
Mondel so unmistakably the hero, that she tore it
up in despair.</p>

<p>"This will never do!" she cried, "I must write
something very different&mdash;something about the ancient
Kings of Madagascar, and a young princess
who had a jealous step-mother; yes that will do, and
as the characters of the story will be black, who
knows but I may make a second Uncle Tom reputation!"</p>

<p>Columbia smiled as she thus spoke to herself, and
already the spirit of <i>art</i> began to whisper consolation
to her wounded heart and distracted mind.</p>

<p>What would Mondel have given could he have
seen her at that moment!</p>

<p>What would he have given?&mdash;His life, his fortune,
his prospects; all the golden islands ever dreamed of!</p>

<p>I once read a curious story in a magazine
more than a hundred years old. It was entitled
"All for the want of knowing one another," and
dwelt upon the vexatious reflection that if people
only knew one another, there would be perfect
happiness in the world. I was much struck by it.
But if all the world were clairvoyant, history would
run up a tree. Romance and adventure would be at
an end.</p>

<p>No, no, it is better as it is; there is at least excitement
in a lottery; and as Nature knows her own
business best, the destinies are, after all, sure to be
accomplished.</p>

<p>Thus Columbia sits down to write articles for
magazines, and Mondel steers his course towards
the antarctic zone. They <i>might</i> have been happier seated
on a velvet sofa, kissing one another, and whispering vows
of adoration? But who dares arraign the
unknown Gods of Time? Let the Anarchs of
Eternity judge them!</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII.</p>

<p>THE VOYAGE TO THE GOLDEN ISLAND.</p>

</div>

<p>NO rest came to Mondel's mind till the Columbia
was out of sight of land. Then, and not till then, his
deep sympathy with the element on which he had
first seen the light, began to exercise a soothing
influence over his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Never," said he, to Peregrine Cope, who stood
by him on the starboard side of the quarter-deck,
near the wheel-house, "never have I, in all my life,
known real peace of mind, save when at sea! unless
it were, perhaps, when a boy I wandered by its
shore, and watched the waves as they came in breaking
upon the sea-weed tangled rocks, or flattening
on the smooth brown sand&mdash;to my feet, more pleasant
walking than the greenest grass, or the most
purple heath, or the most velvety moss in creation!
How many thousand fantastic variations has my
imagination played on that one theme&mdash;the breaking
of the waves upon the shore!</p>

<p>"But it is chiefly in the roar and lashing of the
storm, that my spirit seems to expand and vibrate in
harmony with nature. Then, for a time, the long
pain seems lulled, and a frenetic sombre exhilaration
to fill all my being, more potent than the fumes of
opium or hasheesh, more on a level with the mad
intoxication of love or the fierce excitement of
battle!"</p>

<p>Night descended&mdash;all slept but the watch, and still
Mondel remained upon deck, his eyes alternately
resting upon the stars and upon the sea.</p>

<p>"Oh, how each knot we run increases the pain of
separation from the one centre of hope!" sighed the
adventurer, as he leaned over the taffrail to leeward
and watched the phosphorescent sparkles of the
waters. "Shall I ever behold that shape, that peerless
shape, those glorious blue eyes again?  Yet,
why desire that which could only bring increase of
misery?  She does not love me&mdash;and I, have I no
pride, no secret fund of force to struggle with this
insane delusion, this unreasonable passion?</p>

<p>"No, no, a thousand times, no!  There is no
remedy for such love as mine. Where can I find
beauty more perfect, a soul more elevated, yet more
exquisitely feminine?  Can I deny perfection?  Can
I refute my own matured and cultivated judgment?
And she&mdash;, is it possible that the Fates can be so
cruel as to leave her indifferent to such a love as
mine?  What can I henceforward become&mdash;a Don
Juan, a trifling sensualist, a prating politician, a
pompous poet?  What is all petty praise and vulgar
admiration to the man who has lost a Paradise of
happiness?  All these things I can imagine with the
certainty that if I willed I could attain. But Columbia!&mdash;to
imagine such happiness as her love would
bring is utter torture, the feast of Tantalus, the toil
of the Danaides&mdash;it is the mania for the impossible,
the dream of the non-existent."</p>

<p>And Mondel repeated to himself, a thousand
times. "Fool, she never loved you;" but a mysterious
voice like that of the demon of Socrates,
would still whisper like a bad echo&mdash;"loved you,
loved you!"</p>

<p>The ship's company consisted of Mondel, Peregrine
Cope, the Professor, and the begging gambler; of
a first, second, and third mate, an engineer, assistant
engineer, a carpenter, the doctor&mdash;that is the
cook&mdash;a negro, and twelve men, before the mast.</p>

<p>The Professor officiated as purser&mdash;a humorous
example of the vicissitudes of human adventure.</p>

<p>Mondel was in uncontrolled command, though
the first mate might be said to be acting master,
as far as the managment and navigation of the
vessel was concerned. But Mondel was much
occupied in the engine room. On the care of
the engine, everything depended, and simple as
was its construction, its inventor watched it with
the interest of a father in his child. This it was,
which, in the eyes of his crew and officers, gave
Mondel a weight and importance, which caused
them to forget the anomaly of an amateur commander.
The ship was, as it were, his creation.
He seemed to be its soul, and it an organ of his
will. Moreover, the silent and gloomy Mondel showed
no ignorance of any maritime matters;
seemed fully conversant with nautical terms, and
when he spoke to the crew, which was rarely,
spoke with a brevity, a decision, and a look of
command, which bore no criticism. Alas! the
mysterious fact of his birth upon the ocean, gave
him a superstitious prestige in the eyes of the
veriest old salt on board. Soon, Mondel himself
became familiar with his new position; and as
weeks passed away, and the ship yet cut the water
like a shark, his transports of despair abated, and
a settled melancholy took their place, which never
varied&mdash;unless at times when a mood of boisterous
humor would come over him, and he would joke
and laugh loudly with Cope, and even with his
officers. But his laughing mood ended as abruptly
as it began, and moving away, he would once
more gaze for hours in silence on the dark blue
waters.</p>

<p>Not five weeks had elapsed, since he departed
from New York, and the Columbia had doubled
Cape Horn, and reached the placid waters of the
Pacific. Still, onward sped the vessel, at a rate
unparalleled in nautical annals, making its twenty
knots an hour, in the very teeth of a stiff breeze,
more like some huge leviathan of the deep, than
a machine built by hand, of timber and iron and
copper.</p>

<p>Another week had elapsed, when one forenoon,
a huge black cloud, bearing a fantastic resemblance
to a crowned giant, mounted on a colossal winged
lion, rose unexpectedly on the western horizon,
surrounded and followed by a band of brother monsters,
at first edged with brilliant golden hues, which
soon dissolved into tawny shadows, lit till the
whole spectral array of vapors, uniting in an
impenetrable phalanx, overshadowed the heavens
with a canopy of darkness, clashing their shields
with reverberating strokes of thunder, and darting
their fiery spears from pole to pole, whilst from
the inky sea, uprose in fierce emulation, armies
of crested waves, rolling upon the other, like
insurgent nations, till all fanciful distinctions were
lost in the chaotic fury of the tempest.</p>

<p>The ship pitched, and rolled, and strained, and
groaned as savage Neptune, with his clenched
fist, struck blow after blow, upon its mighty ribs;
ever and anon, some reckless pirate of a wave,
leaping over the bulwarks, drenched to the skin
those who upon deck held on for their lives to
ropes or belaying pins, whilst the hoarse voices
of the ship's officers were drowned in the mingled
war of the elements, till finally, a deluge of water
from above, rendered all pretentions to dry clothes
on deck a mockery. The sailors huddled forward
in, to them, strange inactivity, for the absence of
sails deprived them of the hardest part of their
usual duty, felt themselves given up to Destiny,
whilst Mondel, for the first time since he had
departed on his voyage of adventure, felt the all-absorbing
horror of his inward grief and despair
relieved by the exciting sense of peril, and the
necessity for real exertion. It was soon necessary
to stop the engines, and to trust solely for headway,
to an auxiliary propeller, worked by the very
motion of the vessel itself, and which, of slight
effect in calmer seas, now became a power of
very considerable importance. The hatches were
fastened down, and all on board awaited the result
which such equanimity as their respective temperaments
afforded.</p>

<p>More than once when a tremendous wave struck
the ship and caused her to quiver from stern to stem
with a mute agony, the boldest of the ship's company
prepared themselves for a longer and more
adventurous voyage. Mondel and Cope exchanged
the thoughts of philosophers. The first mate and
the Professor expressed, each in their way, a rude
confidence in, and submission to, the invisible powers
of Nature. But there was one man on board whose
long over-excited brain, unstrung by its recent privation
of habitual stimulus, became, under the influence
of the storm-terror, a complete wreck in the confusion
of its sensations and the extravagance of its developments.</p>

<p>It was the begging Gambler, the originator of the
cruise, the discoverer of the Island Eldorado.</p>

<p>It happened that in the hurry of fastening down
the hatches, he found himself amongst the sailors
in the forecastle, and to them, for the first time
forgetting all the injunctions of Mondel, he opened
his mouth, and disclosed the secret object of the
voyage, and the nature of the hopes which animated
their commander to the enterprise.<p>

<p>From these mad ravings sprang the germ of that
Upas tree of death which was to throw a blood-stained
mantle over the future success of the expedition.</p>

<p>On that day, amid the fury of that storm, was
developed in the heart of a man, the black thought
of mutiny, hereafter to become fertile in action and
disaster.</p>

<p>This man's name was David Borack. He was the
best sailor on board. In stature he was full six feet
and a span, of gigantic frame, and to those who
knew him, formidable as a fierce, brutal, and quarrelsome
ruffian. But with all this he had a rude
plausibility and seeming frankness of manner which
acted very effectually on weaker natures than his
own. In appearance he was not ill-looking, though
his features were coarse and large. His eyes were
of a jetty blackness. His lips full and sensual, and
his hair and beard of a black wiry texture. His
enormous hands were covered with hair even to the
finger tips, and he had a habit of contracting his
bushy brows till they met, when he spoke, and
showing the white of his eye all round the pupil,
when he looked intently at any one, which gave him
a truly diabolical aspect.</p>

<p>Mondel had desired to form his crew of bold and
adventurous materials. Nevertheless he had never
much liked the looks of David Borack, and soon
had occasion to discover that he was a troublesome
personage.</p>

<p>Borack was the only man on board who ever gave
Mondel an insolent word by replying to one of the
latter's commands, which he gave in a moment of
abstraction, by a laugh and a muttered allusion to
landlubbers. Mondel, recalled to himself, corrected
his order calmly, then, looking sternly at the refractory
giant, said very slowly, "Landlubber or not,
you will find that I am captain in my own ship.
Unless you wish to make a three months voyage
in irons, remember it."</p>

<p>Borack never forgot that look. From that moment
he did his duty without venturing on a word, either
to Mondel or his officers. But when he learned
from the strange, half-crazed Gambler the golden
secret, Borack meditated mischief. He managed to
scrape acquaintance with the assistant engineer, and
heard him boast complacently of his own perfect
capacity to direct the engine. Next, David Borack
fixed on the second mate as the one officer who
might be induced to favor his scheme.</p>

<p>The first and third mates were brothers; John, and
Edward Wallace. They were both tall, fair, and
blue-eyed, with the open, gentlemanly air of good
seamen, and men of respectable birth and education.
Both had, in nautical parlance, crept in through the
cabin window. But John, the elder, who was some
six and twenty years of age, was, especially, a first
rate navigator and practical seaman. His brother
was four years younger, but equally efficient in proportion
to his experience.</p>

<p>The second mate's name was Richard Grote. He
was scarcely five feet four inches in height, though
broad-chested as the Farnese Hercules, and of prodigious
personal strength. His face was set in a frame
of bushy red whiskers, and his small green eyes had
the brilliancy and quickness of a serpent's. His
avarice was unbounded, and he was reported to have
already accumulated, and invested ashore, quite a
comparative fortune. There was no sentiment about
Richard Grote. He was a child of the streets, and
had roughed it for five and thirty years in all possible
latitudes. To the men he would have been a
bully and a tyrant had he dared with such eyes
upon him as Mondel's, who, though never familiar
with the sailors, particularly insisted on their good
treatment in every possible way.</p>

<p>Amongst the sailors, Borack placed his great reliance
on Hans Rodde, the Dutchman.</p>

<p>Hans Rodde was the favorite of the forecastle.
About five feet eight inches in stature, and twenty-three
or four years of age, Hans possessed a face of
almost feminine delicacy, large soft brown eyes,
shining with a wicked lustre, and dark curling hair; a
flexile, slightly sarcastic mouth, and a figure so correctly
proportioned, that no unpractised eye would
have suspected the prodigious strength it was capable
of developing. The thrashing, however, which he
administered so easily to Ben Grizzle, next to Borack,
the biggest and heaviest man on board, opened the
eyes of his comrades to his merits as a fighting man.
For the rest, Hans Rodde, though a Dutchman by
origin, spoke English without a foreign accent, and
had received the rudiments of a better education
than the rest of his shipmates. But though he
expressed himself in choicer language, and with a
more elegant manner than the rest, he infinitely
surpassed them all in devices of the most horrible
and unimaginable atrocity. Never were they tired
of listening to his stories and laughing at his jokes, in
which the impurity was only equalled by the utter
want of any apparent sense of conscientiousness. In
a word, Hans Rodde's external gentleness of manner
concealed the cruel fierceness of a young tiger, with
all that beautiful but detestable animal's most
treacherous and murderous instincts.</p>

<p>Ben Grizzle was a huge grumbling fellow, of some
two-and-thirty, who might be well defined as two
yards of thirst and laziness, or thereabouts.</p>

<p>Of the remaining sailors we need not speak more
particularly at present.</p>

<p>When the storm subsided, it proved fortunately
that no serious damage was done, and the Columbia
(which, in Mondel's lover-like superstition, bore a
charmed existence) once more pursued her course
towards the point in the chart indicated by the beggar's
recollections.</p>

<p>Already they had reached the necessary latitude,
and had twice crossed and re-crossed the supposed
meridian, after repeatedly taking the most careful
observations. A look-out was continually kept at
the mast-head, and since the crew were informed of
the great secret, every soul on board was equally
anxious for the hoped-for cry of "<i>land!</i>"</p>

<p>At length it came, and Mondel descried through
his glass the outline of a rocky island, answering in
every respect to the description of the Gambler.</p>

<p>Peter Quartz, who, throughout the voyage, had
hitherto been silent and abstracted, amused himself
mainly by murmuring to himself, as he generally
pervaded the vessel, "Latitude, longitude," till his
old nickname ashore, spontaneously revived amongst
the sailors, and he was Old Latitude and Longitude
on board the Columbia, as of old in the gambling
hells of Gotham.</p>

<p>As they neared the land, perpendicular rocks and
the vast cone-like mountain, with its craggy precipices
and barren surfaces, became clearly visible.</p>

<p>Before night the Columbia was anchored in a convenient
roadstead, and a boat, containing Mondel, the
Gambler, Cope, the third mate, and four sailors, had
effected a landing, and within half an hour, Mondel,
advancing before the rest on the beach, waved for
those in the ship the yellow flag, which was to be
the signal of the complete and absolute confirmation
of the statements of the guide he had trusted.</p>

<p>"We are all rich men!" was the first thought that
swelled the heart of every weather-beaten man, who
had made that voyage of wonder. We shall never
more know poverty! we need toil no more! our
future is a future of enjoyment! We have but to
wish and to receive! The yellow talisman is ours!
We are princes, potentates, and powers, till Death
relieves us of necessity!"</p>

<p>The pale blue eyes of Peter Quartz flashed with a
strange fire.</p>

<p>Even Mondel was not without his share of this
mighty and too human exultation!</p>

<p>He too had tasted the bitterness of poverty, the
mortification of embarrassment, the humiliation of
debt. He knew too thoroughly the horrors which
afflict this pauper planet, not to appreciate most
intensely the triumph of possessing a power which is
universal empire&mdash;the power of gold!</p>

<p>But whilst all the rest of the crew save Cope and
Mondel, went almost mad with joy, these two friends
and philosophers made all their arrangements for
taking in a cargo of the precious metal as speedily as
possible in order to return, before their stores were
exhausted, and enjoy the fruits of their adventure.</p>

<p>Mondel then devised a system of division by which
two-fifths of the cargo should be the property of the
owners, one-fifth of it Peter Quartz, the discoverer
of the Island, one-fifth to be divided amongst the
officers in certain proportions, and the remaining fifth
to be equally shared by the crew. He explained to
the latter that as each would have more than he
would probably be ever able to spend, it was utterly
absurd to attempt any foolish plans of secretion, since
moreover, he determined that before leaving the ship,
it should be well ascertained that no one took a
single pound of gold away beyond his share of the
common stock.</p>

<p>This arrangement was absolutely necessary to
check the wild infatuation which seized on the poor
men at the aspect of the gold.</p>

<p>In less than a week all was complete. The
Columbia bore in her hold such a treasure as no
earthly monarch yet even dreamed of possessing, and
Mondel&mdash;Mondel the poet, the adventurer, the
dreamer, was the richest man upon the face of the
earth&mdash;aye richer than a hundred Rothschilds.
And in the midst of all his incalculable wealth he
had but one thought&mdash;to return to New York, and
once more to make a last effort to soften the indifference
of the only real treasure which he believed in&mdash;Columbia.</p>

<p>How willingly, to ensure the possession of that
blonde maiden and her love, would he have seen all
his gold sunk in the blue Pacific, and returned a
penniless adventurer, once more to recommence the
hard struggle with the devils incarnate of this selfish
Pandemonium, called the world.</p>

<p>The ship was loaded with gold. But before leaving
the island, one thing remained to be done&mdash;to
gratify a traveller's curiosity. The island was
explored in all directions. No symptoms of vegetation
were discovered, no sign of living animal, or
even nest of bird. Nothing could be more utterly
inhospitable&mdash;not even a spring of fresh water was
detected&mdash;a bitter disappointment, for a supply of
water was desirable, and its want might necessitate a
visit to some other of the Polynesian Isles, whilst all
agreed in one longing to return home, and commence
reaping the harvest of their golden expedition.</p>

<p>Lastly, Mondel, Cope, and the greater part of the
crew, including the Professor and the Gambler, made
a grand ascent of the conical mountain, and after
immense exertion, succeeded in reaching its summit
and looking down into the crater.</p>

<p>Imagine their astonishment on beholding in the
centre of this crater, with almost perpendicular sides,
at a depth of some hundreds of feet, a lake of water,
in which the blue sky and the sides of the crater
itself, with the figure of the adventurers on the margin,
were reflected with the accuracy of a plate-glass
mirror.</p>

<p>This lake was, perhaps, a third of a mile in diameter.
Nothing can give any idea of its intense
lucidity and motionless smoothness.</p>

<p>"I wonder if it is salt water or fresh?" said Cope,
regarding the lake with unmitigated amazement.</p>

<p>"It <i>looks</i> fresh," said Mondel, however, that is no
criterion.</p>

<p>"I should be sorry to back myself to drink a
gallon of it," said the Professor.</p>

<p>"We are all too rich to bet now," said the first mate,
laughing.</p>

<p>"I see no possibility of descending," said Cope.

<p>"Nor do I," said Mondel.</p>

<p>"Nor I," said the mate.</p>

<p>"Nor I," said each of the rest, in succession.</p>

<p>The discoverer of the island alone said nothing,
but, at some distance from the rest, remained with his
eyes fixed, as if fascinated, on the watery mirror
below.</p>

<p>Suddenly&mdash;whether it was that a vertigo seized
him from looking over the precipice, or that the
edge of the rock on which he stood simply gave way
beneath his feet&mdash;suddenly with an unearthly shriek,
that awoke a thousand piercing echoes from the walls
of the rock-built amphitheatre, the unfortunate
Gambler lost his equilibrium, fell over the edge of
the crater, and as the rock on which he stood slightly
overhung the lake, was precipitated in an instant
into its depths.</p>

<p>But no, strange phenomenon! the body of the
unfortunate man scarcely disappeared beneath the
surface, before it reappeared, extended as on a real
mirror; so rapidly did the lake recover its marvellous
smoothness; and what was, of all, the most
strange thing to behold, the body reappeared after
its immersion, to all appearances converted into a
statue of silver!</p>

<p>Mute horror seized all present at this astounding
spectacle.</p>

<p>A dead silence followed the hideous miracle.</p>

<p>The superstitious sailors began to have vague
thoughts of enchanted islands and the devil. Ben
Grizzle, even, put the question to himself, whether
all was not illusion on the isle, and whether the
gold might not dissolve like "an unsubstantial
pageant," or, if not actually fantastical, prove to
be lumps of sulphur or sandstone!</p>

<p>Such were Ben Grizzle's reflections, and not his
alone; others had fancies which differed from his,
only in form, not in substance.</p>

<p>Their philosophic captain observed the phenomenon,
and being inaccessible to all superstitions
but love, simply summed up its features, and
arrived at a practical conclusion.</p>

<p>"It is a lake of quicksilver," said Mondel.</p>

<p>"Of quicksilver?" cried Cope.</p>

<p>"Most assuredly, how else explain the fact, that
a body becomes silvered over, and remains upon its
surface."</p>

<p>"It is indeed strange."</p>

<p>"Not at all; quicksilver is seventeen times
heavier than water; a human body therefore displaces
less one-seventeenth of its bulk, so little,
in fact, that it scarcely <i>indents</i> the liquid metal&mdash;which
gold and platina alone surpass in gravity."</p>

<p>"What are we to do, sir?" said the first mate.</p>

<p>"Nothing; we <i>can</i> do nothing.  The man was
dead the moment he sank beneath the poisonous
lake, whose fumes we ought to fly as from a pestilence.
Besides, descent is impossible, and with the
sun now shining vertically, to stay here is suicidal.
We must care for the living, let the dead care for
themselves."</p>

<p>And with a last look at the glittering form, that
lay extended on the lake, now blazing with unendurable
brightness, from the effect of the fierce
solar rays, Mondel and Cope followed their already
retreating companions towards the boats, eager to
abandon an abode of horrors, such as not unfrequently
accompany the presence of unbounded
treasures.</p>

<p>Within the space of a few hours, the Columbia
had left the setting sun, and the golden island
behind her, and the shades of evening began to fall
prematurely on the body of the mendicant Gambler.</p>

<p>Lord of unbounded wealth, triumphantly successful
in the great object of his life, Peter Quartz died,
like many a greater man, upon the very eve of
realizing that worldly enjoyment which he had
known but as a desire, a hope, a far-off vision.</p>

<p>Thus, conquerors have died in the hour of victory,
genius on the threshold of glory.</p>

<p>"It is strange," said Mondel to Cope, as he
looked down into the engine room, from the main-deck,
"that the same imprisoned god which bore
him to his destiny, should also give him welcome
to the land of shadows."</p>

<p>"Who knows but that his spirit will be translated
to the planet <i>Mercury?</i>"  said Cope, smiling sadly.</p>

<p>"I have no pity for the dead," said Mondel, "and
in this case, there are no living sufferers to deplore
the loss of a protector."</p>

<p>"We owe him our fortune," said Cope.</p>

<p>"We owe everything every day to somebody,
nevertheless, I shall write a poem to his memory."</p>

<p>"A sufficient honor to have tumbled into a mercurial
pond for!" said Cope ironically.</p>

<p>"What a fantastic dream life is!" sighed Mondel.
"Now all these strange adventures, this voyage, this
motley crew, our novel companionship as modern
Jasons in search of the golden fleece, and means of
fleecing our fellows, to me appears spectral and
unreal. There is but one real thing for the soul in
Nature, its master passion, its dominating thought!"</p>

<p>"In a word," said Cope&mdash;"Columbia!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said the pale leader of the gold-seekers,
"Columbia or death!"</p>

<p>"Incurable!" sighed Cope; "and before he gets back
to New York, she will have been married to
some highly respectable merchant."</p>

<p>"Work, work, messengers of the gods!" murmured
the poet, still looking down upon his engine,
fancifully apostrophizing his metallic slave, whose
resistless expansive force, gave way to the iron giant
below. "Work, work, and bear your master to the
Mecca of his pilgrimage! let him once more kiss the
black stone of scorn's Caaba, and then farewell to
dreams of empire, glory; creation! Farewell to
pride and passion, to science and to art, to illusion
and to torment! At the worst, even my enemies
cannot deny that I have lived and died&mdash;a man!"</p>

<p>"Sail ho!" cried the look-out at the mast head.</p>

<p>But night descended, and with the morning
the stranger had disappeared from the circle, and sea
and air met unbroken round the Columbia.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII.</p>

<p>MUTINY.</p>

</div>

<p>"THERE was some foul play!" said David Borack.</p>

<p>"He was the first discoverer of the island, remember,"
said Hans Rodde, "and it was the Captain's
interest to get rid of him."</p>

<p>"He fell very suddenly!" said Ben Grizzle.</p>

<p>"Very;" said another of the malcontents.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" said Borack.</p>

<p>"I"&mdash;said the voice of the third mate.</p>

<p>It was a dark night, and the mutineers had assembled
near the head of the vessel.</p>

<p>Their plan was long since matured. It was to
wait until the third mate was officer of the watch,
seize him, and then surprise the captain in his state
cabin.</p>

<p>Their first object was easily accomplished, and
Edward Wallace was secured and gagged before he
could give the alarm. The further execution of
David Borack's project to get possession of the ship
and all its treasure, would have been equally certain,
had not the demon of restlessness which possessed
the soul of Mondel, caused him by mere accident to
ascend, in his slippers and a loose wrapper, the gangway
of the chief cabin, at the very moment of the
seizure of his third officer by the mutineers. Ben
Grizzle, who was mounting guard at the head of the
stairs, luckily happened to turn his head for an
instant, to see the result of the struggle. This
inadvertency enabled Mondel to draw back quietly,
return to his state room, seize his sword and revolver,
awaken Cope, and return to the stairs, just in
time to pass his straight military sword through the
body of David Borack as, armed with an axe and a
double-barrelled pistol, he led the van of the descending
mutineers.</p>

<p>Borack uttered a yell of agony, and threw himself
upon Mondel, who, overwhelmed by the weight of
the giant, staggered back.</p>

<p>Borack fired his pistol without effect, and then
aimed a blow at Mondel with the axe, which fortunately
struck only the frame work of the cabin door.</p>

<p>Mondel fired, and Borack fell mortally wounded.
Ben Grizzle, who followed, received the Captain's
sword in his heart, and fell instantly. But Hans
Rodde who next followed, struck Mondel on his
uncovered head with a hand spike so violently, that
although he partially guarded the blow with his
sword, he fell stunned with the blow and would have
been dispatched at once by the young Dutchman's
knife, but for the sudden diversion caused by some
scene upon deck, which caused the other mutineers to
re-ascend the staircase with much greater eagerness
than they had evinced in their descent.</p>

<p>Hans Rodde's attention was diverted for an instant,
and by the time he again turned to Mondel, he
received a ball from Cope's revolver in the shoulder,
which disabled him&mdash;a second barrel of the revolver
fired by the same steady hand, sent the soul of Hans
Rodde to the gulf of mysteries.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Professor and the first mate having
by some means, reached the deck, maintained an
unequal contest with the remaining mutineers, till
Cope and Mondel, who rose almost immediately; his
broken sword still grasped firmly in his hand, appearing
in the scene, the bloody drama ended by the
unconditional submission of the three surviving mutineers
and the commission to the deep of the corpses
of David Borack, Hans Rodde, and their companions.
As for the second mate, Richard Grote, he had been
brained by the Professor with a marling spike, and
was found near the windlass, still gasping, though
past all hope of recovery. He too was thrown overboard
in the fierce excitement of the hour, and
Mondel found himself once more undisputed master
of a vessel full of gold, but deficient in men, water,
and, in the event of a protracted voyage, or any
accident to the engines, of the most necessary
provisions.</p>

<p>At this time the clouds cleared away from the
heavens, and the rays of the moon fell on the pale
stern brow of their chief, as with his bloody sword
still in his hands, he briefly thanked his friends for
the energy displayed in the late desperate and
unhappy emergency.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he uttered a few words on the necessity
for unparalleled exertion on the part of all
remaining on board, when the boom of a gun broke
the silence of the night, and a rakish looking brig
was seen bearing down under full sail upon the
Columbia.</p>

<p>Mondel hastened to the engine-room. Cope took
the wheel. The assistant engineer was dead, and
Mondel had to rouse the engineer himself from a
deep slumber, which not even the firing of the
pistols had interrupted. Perhaps, living in the perpetual
noise and jar of the machinery; he was less
susceptible in his acoustic sensibilities, than is usual.
The mate looked through his glass at the suspicious
stranger.</p>

<p>"It is a pirate&mdash;by G&mdash;&mdash;, a pirate!" said he,
seizing his speaking trumpet&mdash;"Sir,&mdash;Mr. Mondel! a
pirate. He hoists the black flag and makes sure of
us."</p>

<p>"Probably he mistakes us for a vessel in distress,"
said Mondel, reascending, "Now for my air-guns,
now is the time to test their efficacy! At the worst
we can outstrip them, as soon as the engine is in full
play; meanwhile to the work!"</p>

<p>"Rivers!" he resumed, "bring up the canisters!
you understand me!"</p>

<p>The Professor descended, and returned, almost
immediately with two cylinders of iron, with
which Mondel immediately proceeded to load his
stern-chasers. A few turns of their powerful screws,
and the air was compressed which was to expedite
the deadly explosive. Each cylinder had a
spike at its end, and contained materials of such
destructive character, that any vessel struck by
one of them, was certain to be seriously damaged
if not utterly destroyed. The preparation of these
terrible explosives, in a safely portable form, was
a recent discovery, of which Mondel had, with
his usual love of progress in all things, taken
care to avail himself.</p>

<p>The first canister was projected without effect,
and perhaps still sleeps harmlessly at the bottom
of the ocean. The second produced an effect for
which even Mondel was unprepared. There was
a quick lurid flash, a sound, a dispersion of fragments,
and within three minutes the pirate vessel
had disappeared!</p>

<p>All strained their eyes incredulously towards
the vacant space. Yet, so it was, the fatal missile
had struck the pirate right abeam, between wind
and water, exploded, and in so doing, tore up
the deck, and opened a vast rent in the side of
the vessel, which, admitting the sea, caused her
to sink almost instantaneously.</p>

<p>"Truly the Columbia bears a charmed life!"
said Mondel.</p>

<p>"Truly, her Captain leads a charmed life!" said
Cope, who, like all philosophers, was capable of
joking under the most exciting circumstances.</p>

<p>But the gods of ocean, were not yet weary, nor was
the ship Columbia ever destined to see port,
or discharge cargo again in this world.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>Three weeks later, the Panama and San Francisco
steamer picked up a boat containing three
gaunt; hollow-eyed, and hungry men, almost starved,
perishing with thirst, and yet bearing a brave and
undaunted aspect, in their last and most desperate
extremity.</p>

<p>These men were, the commander of the Columbia&mdash;Dudley
Mondel, Peregrine Cope, and that
remarkable ex-housebreaker, who we have so long
alluded to as the Professor; they, and they alone,
survived.</p>

<p>But though they had seen the ship of gold go
down before their eyes, they were still the envied
possessors of certain lumps of that eternal "incentive
to vice" and "indispensable requisite to happiness"&mdash;the
yellow talisman&mdash;tied up in canvass
covers, and thrown at the bottom of the boat,
as ballast, to the extent of at least one million
of dollars in value!</p>

<p>And let it be put down to the credit of Mondel,
Cope, and their faithful follower, that starved
and parched as they were, they were <i>still</i> too
deeply convinced of the superiority of the moral
torture of poverty, over the physical agony of
privation, to either ask for bread or water, till
their hard-won treasure had been deposited, by
the captain of the steamer's orders, in a place of
security.</p>

<p>"Who are you, gentlemen?" said he of the
steamer, impressed, notwithstanding his deplorable
condition as to clothing, by the stately manner
of Mondel, as he stood, surrounded by the curious
passengers, on the quarterdeck.</p>

<p>"I am Dudley Mondel, lord of the golden
island," said the late captain of the Columbia,
with a faint smile.</p>

<p>Four days later, our adventurers found themselves
luxuriating at the best hotel in San Francisco.</p>

<p id="c29">CHAPTER XXIX.</p>

<p>BERKELEY MARRIED.</p>

</div>

<p>THERE is no more curious or painful drama acted
on the world's stage than one-sided love.</p>

<p>To the laughing devils of the soured and skeptical
school, the sight of a man desperately bent on self-delusion
as to a woman's feelings towards himself, is
full of the comic element, and the observation of a
woman under a similar hallucination respecting a
man, supremely amusing.</p>

<p>To the profound thinker there is nothing more
tragic.</p>

<p>How often, and under how many varied conditions,
have I studied this melancholy phase in the grand
comedy of life!</p>

<p>John Berkeley had, we have seen, persuaded Mrs.
Yonkers to elope with him. He had attained possession
of the great object of his desires; he had
realized a felicity, which to him had been the one
green oasis of hope in a desert of crime and suffering.</p>

<p>How brief was his delusion! He had, it is true,
obtained possession of Amelia&mdash;that is, the outward
and visible Amelia, with all her beauty of form, her
dark lustrous hair, and large soul-subduing eyes.
But of the real Amelia&mdash;the <i>&pi;&nu;&epsilon;&upsilon;&mu;&alpha;</i>, the animating
principle of that charming form&mdash;he possessed no
more than the great Khan of Tartary, or the
Ethiopian Highpriest of Mumbo-Jumbo in the lands
beyond the Koran's range, near to the Mountains of
the Moon.</p>

<p>Amelia had in fact eloped with Berkeley, because
she was desperate. She had loved Mondel with all
the fiery passionate sensualism of her nature. His
indifference had outraged her vanity, wounded her
pride, and left behind it a sense of incurable dissatisfaction.
But for Columbia, she felt, things would
have happened very differently. She, Amelia, would
have been the heroine of a deliciously romantic
intrigue, living in a perpetual state of interesting and
exciting relations with a man who possessed the
faculty of perpetually amusing, puzzling, and pleasing
her. She could not understand Mondel, it is
true, but the very mystery which hung round his
vast powers and acquirements, and strange, daring,
indefinite aims, made him irresistibly fascinating to
her imagination. Before she saw him, her step-daughter
Columbia affected her with a presentiment
of the coming influence. Both had the same pale
transparent spiritual complexion, the same fathomless
look of infinite thought, the same silky hair and
unstudied grace of movement, even in moments of
embarrassment. Both had that peculiar wildness
and impulsive forcible tone, manner, gesture and
look, which is the certain sign of genius. Both had,
in a word, precisely what she had <i>not</i>&mdash;that regal air
of self-reliance, which inspired our great ancestral
God of war <i>Odin</i>, in the old Norse ballad.</p>

<p>"<i>I am a king</i>," said he<br/>

"My empire is the sea,<br/>

My throne yon ship that rides<br/>

At anchor in the haven;<br/>

Above whose topmost mast,<br/>

Fit comrade of the blast,<br/>

My regal standard floats,&mdash;<br/>

The yet unconquered raven."</p>

<p>The hero has returned from a prolonged cruise in
his Viking-galley; and thus answers the insolent
demand of Lok as to his rank and ancestry.*</p>

<p>[*The production on the stage of the present writer's unpublished poem or
drama of "<i>Odin</i>," has been delayed by the difficulties inherent in the piece
itself, which requires a large stage and expensive accessories: also by the
unremitting engagement of the author in other literary occupations.]</p>

<p>But it was as impossible for Amelia and Columbia
to be true friends, as for Amelia and Mondel really
to harmonize in love.</p>

<p>Eagles cannot mate with herons. The bird of
Jove, whose "home is heaven's light," soars habitually
in regions unattainable to inferior birds. Thus,
too, genius, in its constant exaltation of idea, leaves
the petty prejudice and narrow sympathies of ordinary
society so far beneath its spiritual feet, that
it becomes undistinguishable, from distance, to the
vulgar; yet, just as the dark speck upon the sky
excites our interest, because we know it to <i>be</i> an
eagle, so genius, even when incomprehensible to
ordinary mortals, is still genius&mdash;the revelation of
ideal knowledge and beauty to mankind.</p>

<p>With regard to Berkeley, Mrs. Yonkers neither
liked nor disliked him, though flattered by the love
of a man who in many respects was a desirable
conquest. He was young, and, in his peculiar style,
handsome, accomplished as a man of the world, and
now reported rich. He had force, vivacity, and
energy in his character, but no poetry, no romance,
no charming playfulness of manner. There was
always something cynical, reserved, indifferent in
his look. Even in his love he was earnest and
impassioned, without being gentle or pleasing. There
was devotion, but no tenderness in his nature.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Mrs. Yonkers became his mistress;
and, by the ceremony of marriage, his wife,
upon the death of Mr. Yonkers.</p>

<p>His life was a purgatory of alternate hope, despair,
and savage jealousy.</p>

<p>Amelia trifled with the stern and implacable
Berkeley, as might an oriental despot with a chained
tiger.</p>

<p>Berkeley raged, yet loved. The coldness with
which his burning passion, the pent-up torrent of
a whole life's abnegation, was received, only served
to increase the value of its indulgence. He worshipped
the indifferent Amelia, as an Indian worships
his three-headed god. His whole life was passed
in asking himself this one question, "Does she love
me or does she not?" Will she or can she love
me? was a still more sombre form of putting the
same all-important query.</p>

<p>As for Amelia, though she could not command
the weather-like variations of her temper, she
wished to make the best of her lot, and enjoy
life to the utmost; so, after asking herself the above
question, and arriving much more readily at an
answer, she concluded that she could quite well
endure to be loved by her husband, and forthwith
began to think of all other possible distractions.
Her extravagance knew no limits; and when she
returned to New York, the unbounded profusion
of her outlay called round her a sort of parasitical
circle of people, quite as well bred, indeed
much more instructive and amusing, than her
old humdrum commercial circle. Her drawing-room,
indeed, became the rendezvous of the most remarkable
foreign adventurers; Cuban patriots, Irish fortune
hunters&mdash;counts, French, Italian or Polish, who
had counted their chances in the Old world, and
made themselves counts, expressly to get an
additional chance in the New. There too, were
to be seen seventh-rate literati, and men who were
lions because they had discovered sciences which
did not exist. Also were seen spiritual mediums,
and kings of France, of Indian origin, and many
nice young men who danced there, and did heaven
knows what elsewhere, and looked very much as if
they had all been dressed by contract, by the same
tailor, and let out for the night as stop-gaps and
fill-corners.</p>

<p>The species of infatuation&mdash;the infatuation of
the senses&mdash;of which Berkeley was the victim, is
radically incurable, except by death, or a higher
form of passion. The miserable counterfeiter
indulged every whim of his syren, accepting every
humiliation and neglect on her part, little more
than a husband in name, since the ever-ready
plea of illness was always at hand to exclude
him from his wife's apartments, or convert him
from a lover into a nurse. All this he bore, and
to gratify his ungrateful wife, lavished upon her
his ill-gotten fortune with recklessness, which soon
brought him to the alternative of immediate and
positive retrenchment, or a fresh plunge into the
hazardous career which for nearly two years, he
had entirely and delightedly abandoned.</p>

<p>Amelia received the news of their impoverishment
with amazement and scorn. Why did he
remain idle, why did he not speculate? do something?
make money like other people, as he had done
formerly?</p>

<p>Then this luxurious Phryne, putting on an
affectionate air, and lavishing on Berkeley a few
careless caresses, which as usual he accepted, as
the dog accepts the crumbs from the rich man's
table, entreated her husband not to make her
miserable by talking to her of poverty, and misery,
and all sorts of disagreeable things. She wondered
he did not suggest a boarding-house at once, or
emigrate to Minnesota.</p>

<p>Berkeley left Amelia in a state of terrible agitation.
Finally he resolved to make&mdash;literally to <i>make</i>&mdash;money
to supply all demands for the present.</p>

<p>Amelia was delighted to hear no more talk of
economy, and all went on as usual, till one evening
Berkeley, who still secretly retained his old house,
though he occupied one in Fourteenth street with
Amelia, and was about to devote the night to his
infernal manufacture, Berkeley, I repeat, told his
wife that he had to call upon a friend at some distance
from the city, and should not return till the
next day.</p>

<p>It so happened however that a couple of hours
afterwards he <i>did</i> return, for his pocket-book, which
contained the very notes he was about to transfer
and reproduce.</p>

<p>As he entered by means of a latch-key, he overheard
Amelia in the drawing-room say these
ominous words in a tone which few jealous husbands
are slow to recognize&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do not run away, my dear Count&mdash;Mr. Berkeley
is out of town. He will not return till to-morrow.
I am so glad you called."</p>

<p>Berkeley remained motionless on the doormat.
He was naturally noiseless in his movements.
He unlocked a street door as no other man unlocked it.
The next five minutes satisfied him. He advanced
to the door just ajar, and through the crack of the
hinge (that terrible crack)! he saw his adored
Amelia pillowing her soft cheek on the shoulder of a
particularly handsome and black-bearded Frenchman,
the Count Alfred de Clichy in fact&mdash;otherwise Alfred
Clichy ex-cashier of Tripier's bank at Paris, political,
alias felonious, exile at New York.</p>

<p>Now John Berkeley, who knew a great many
things which his wife did not know, knew the
fascinating Count Alfred de Clichy, in vernacular
parlance, like a book. So, without more ado, he
walked into the room, giving the lovers just time to
assume a suitable innocence of attitude and aspect.</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear, I am returned you see sooner than
I said," began the Alterer with a feigned carelessness
which did not altogether deceive Amelia. Not
however suspecting that he had actually seen or
heard anything, she said in her usual tone&mdash;</p>

<p>"John, here is the Count."</p>

<p>Amelia liked Counts. It is an amiable weakness
in some American ladies. She liked Lords too, and
titles of all descriptions, both of home and foreign
manufacture. Perhaps, the novelty of the latter,
made them more attractive.</p>

<p>"Count? what Count?" said Berkeley, looking
with an insulting coolness of contempt at Clichy.</p>

<p>"Why, the Count de Clichy, my dear, of course,"
said Amelia, flushing crimson.</p>

<p>"Where is he? I see no Count de Clichy," said
Berkeley; still annihilating the fascinating Alfred,
with the look of a basilisk.</p>

<p>"Mais, Monsieur,"&mdash;began M. Clichy, rising and
trying to give an air of spirit and dignity, to his
large and somewhat portly figure.</p>

<p>"Don't try to impose on <i>me!</i>" thundered Berkeley,
all at once breaking out, and turning absolutely livid
with fury. "Do you think I want my house to be a
rendezvous for every French pickpocket and blackguard,
that likes to stick Count and de before his
name? <i>I</i> know you, Monsieur Clichy; <i>I</i> recollect
you at Paris years ago, as gar&ccedil;on at a <i>caf&eacute;</i> in the
Rue Vivienne (this invention, for it was an invention
of Berkeley's, told fearfully on the nerves of Mrs. B.),
from which you were turned away for stealing the
spoons! Out of my house, rascal! and never let me
catch you here again!"&mdash;howled, rather than spoke,
the Alterer, as he rather carried than dragged the
unfortunate "Count" to the street-door, and fairly
kicked him into the kennel.</p>

<p>"Madame," said Berkeley, when (after administering
a few supplementary kicks to the prostrate
Alfred) he returned, still ghastly pale, "I have long
suspected you, I now know and despise you."</p>

<p>"John, I am innocent, indeed I am," said Amelia,
not sobbing, but very much frightened at her husband's
violence, and very much humiliated at his
treatment of the supposed Count.</p>

<p>"Madame," said Berkeley, with a look of very
cold contempt. "I have the honor to wish you a
very good evening." Mrs. Berkeley sat stupefied
with consternation. By the time she recovered the
use of her faculties, her husband was gone.</p>

<p>Early on the following morning, there was a fire
up town. It was the old house of the counterfeiter.
Berkeley had made his last ten thousand
dollars, and quitted New York for ever.</p>

<p>In the course of the following day, the officer
of justice came to the house in Fourteenth Street,
to arrest Berkeley as a forger, and his wife as
his accomplice. They found only the latter.</p>

<p>It was from the <i>Tombs</i> that Columbia received
the first communication she had had from her step-mother,
since the elopement.</p>

<p>In her despair, at the unexpected horrors of
her position, the wretched lady could think of
no one to apply to for aid, but the noble-hearted
and generous Columbia. In return for her sympathy,
and assistance, she offered to explain the
whole mystery of her conduct, with respect to Mondel.
Thus were the statements of the unfortunate
lover confirmed, and his conduct justified. But
where was he, this tried and acquitted criminal
of love? Answer ye waves, ye tempests, isles of
metallic horrors, knife of mutineer, and ball of
pirate; answer ye fevers, and physicians of the
golden land, where is he? where is Mondel?</p>

<p>Where is the poet-adventurer, the eternal lover of
Columbia, the fair, the imperial?</p>

<p>Two years have passed away, and no news of
Mondel. His fame as a writer is beginning to
recede into the past, his character as a man is
over-clouded with dark shadows. Vaguely the
words adventurer and pirate are mingled. Saddest
of all, rumors of wrecks, and every rational
conjecture, hint at one only possible solution.
Dudley Mondel is dead. Columbia has opened
her eyes too late. Thenceforward, her heart is a
mausoleum, not a temple, and her brow grows paler
and her cheeks grow thinner, and her fingers whiter,
and her eyes more spiritually beautiful, as she
murmurs&mdash;</p>

<p>"Death, what is death? Oh! let me too die,
and be at rest!"</p>

<p>Rest!&mdash;vain demand&mdash;there is no rest for spirits,
even in eternity. There is no rest&mdash;but there <i>is</i>
happiness <i>somewhere, or Nature were herself</i> a lie
and a delusion.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p id="c30">CHAPTER XXX.</p>

<p>THE FAIR SLAVE OF THE LAMP.</p>

</div>

<p>FOR two long dismal years, Columbia had toiled,
and wept, and hoped, and dreamed, and despaired,
in solitude and poverty.</p>

<p>Pride, noble pride, and that mysterious intuition
of the soul, which divines, without comprehending,
the unknown, and the unborn event, sustained
her in her arduous struggle.</p>

<p>Nor did Mrs. Normer's kind and cheerful consolations
fail to have their effect on the sensitive
feelings, however, little they really biased the independent
judgment of Columbia.</p>

<p>Mrs. Normer would not hear of any accident
to Mondel. He would most certainly return, and
return a rich and successful man. Had he
not said to her at parting, that he should come back
a millionaire? Why did he not write?&mdash;What
was the use in writing? He was never a man of
letters, in the corresponding sense. Once, he was
absent for six months before, and never wrote to
any one, as she, Mrs. Normer knew, for she inquired
of all his friends, and none of them had heard
of him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Columbia wrote tale after tale, and
sent them to the magazines, and was kept waiting
and neglected, and refused, and her manuscripts
lost, and her patience sorely tried in every possible
way. It is true, some of her pieces were
admired, and quoted, and reprinted, but all this
produced no personal advantage to the authoress,
and Columbia, who could not see a beggar, or
listen to a tale of distress, without opening
her purse to the sufferer, found herself constantly poor,
and behind-hand, and anxious. Her dresses began
to wear out, and were not replaced. She began
to taste that refined misery, which Mondel had so
graphically described, those exquisitely petty mortifications,
which corrode and embitter the hearts
of the delicate and refined children of misfortune.</p>

<p>The world became repulsive as well as gloomy to
her imagination. Day by day, she became more
fond of solitude, more abstracted in her manner,
more indifferent to appearances. Like a beautiful
ghost, she glided along the main streets of the city,
her eyes fixed upon invisible phantasms, her lovely
countenance pale and sad as a nun's, her brows
slightly contracted with that expression of nervous
endurance so peculiarly indicative of profound mental
anguish, her fingers drawn together with nervous
tension, the very image of a beautiful Sibyl,
an enchanted princess, a creature of another world
wildly wandering through the horrors of an earthly
Inferno!</p>

<p>Oh, ye cold-blooded men of rank and office, gold
and commerce! how willingly would I forgive you
for all the assassinations which your heartless indifference
to the Great and the God-like, has committed
on the unhappy knights of intellect and companions
of the great order of Light! After all, they were
<i>men</i>, and fell fighting for the cause of truth, and
love, and beauty&mdash;fell bravely, as fell the Titans of
old, crushed by the bolts of Fate, and the omnipotent
arm of Jove. Even now I see them&mdash;the gaunt and
ill-paid soldiers of the great living army of martyrs,
and it rejoices me to hear the low, muttered defiance
of all comers, and their eternal watchword "Victory
or death!&mdash;and even <i>in</i> death&mdash;Victory!"</p>

<p>But for the sufferings of the fair and noble
daughters of genius, I do <i>not</i> forgive you. It is for
this that I not only hate your meanness, but abhor
your very existence. It is for this that I curse your
civilization, your policies, your institutions, your
spasmodic enterprise!&mdash;You <i>men?</i>&mdash;races of cowards
and pedlars! You who on all sides and every possible
way <i>see women suffer</i>, and are calm, contented,
easy in your iniquities.</p>

<p>Once more, the vice of this age is MEANNESS.
Look to it England, land of selfish aristocracy and
servile shopkeepers! look to it America, land of
greedy speculators and corrupt politicians! look to
it France, land of police spies and slaves! The
angels look down from the heavens and weep at
your meanness, the demons laugh below at the age
of traffic and progress!</p>

<p>To the devil with your progress! if the many are
still to agonize for the benefit of the few! if young
and lovely women are still to be driven by your
society to starvation or the streets. Learn this
great fact. All your philanthropy up to this present
moment has been a pitiful humbug. My worthy,
wealthy Pharisees! you have hitherto tried to
do good <i>at too cheap a rate, to give an immense deal
and sacrifice nothing!</i></p>

<p>Besides, your system is in itself demoniacal. You
wait for <i>extreme cases</i>, you are so grossly material
that you can think only of the sufferings of the
body. For the tortures of the soul you have no pity.
You are overwhelmed with applications!&mdash;What a
sad infliction! when in fact you ought to invite
them and rejoice in the opportunity of doing good.</p>

<p>But what would you have us do? you say; perhaps.</p>

<p>Wait a little, and I will tell you.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <i>give!</i>  But you want to <i>save</i>. O,
generation of <i>savers!</i> there was one who of old
gained the name of <i>Saviour</i> and whom the like of
you crucified, but <i>he saved men</i>&mdash;not dollars.</p>

<p>And what <i>do</i> you save after all?</p>

<p>A capital which is a fiction, a lie, a forgery with
which to pay, that is, enslave, future labor. Is the
world richer by a cent for a dollar saved by an
individual?</p>

<p>Imagine the Gods <i>saving</i>. And do you not boast
that you were made in a God's image?  Traditionally
ye <i>were</i>, but it was a <i>Hebrew</i> God's. He knew
the avarice of man, and directed that every fifty
years the work of vicious accumulation should be
annihilated for the general good, and all lands
revert to the original families who had owned them.
But <i>ye</i>, with your <i>forged</i> bills issued on <i>sham</i> security;
buy up the lands of the people, and torture their
souls with rents heavier than the worst taxes of the
Old world, and for the people of the American God,
that is the God of Nature, there is no jubilee of restitution,
the wrong done is eternal!</p>

<p>But it is not <i>now</i>, that I can say all that I <i>have</i> to
say on these subjects. I was speaking of the sufferings
of Columbia.</p>

<p>This is no common fiction of the day&mdash;for those
who can understand it, there is deep truth slumbering
beneath its wildest extravagances.</p>

<p>That one of the most beautiful and accomplished
and learned and adorable ladies in the land, should
suffer day by day the most intense anxiety, for the
mere means of subsistence, that such a being should
live in constant danger of becoming a beggar and a
dependent, may seem, to gross minds, a very simple
casualty.</p>

<p>To me, it appears a horrible sign of the times,
when genius, although acknowledged and appreciated,
is yet permitted to suffer. Still more horrible
it seems to me, that that genius should be ever
embodied in the person of a woman!</p>

<p>"But you are writing a novel!"</p>

<p>A novel? O wise and heroic citizens! what can
the poet invent half so thrilling, half so worthy
of record, as the simple facts of the life, which
whirls and seethes and groans and laughs around
us?</p>

<p>Who knows, but for Mrs. Normer's generous affection,
that the blonde Columbia, the very type and
acme of the American woman, in her most glorious
perfection, would not have felt the actual pangs of
hunger as others, fair loving and talented, <i>have</i>
felt them?</p>

<p>Beware, beware, my great adopted country! that
with his dying breath, a poet does not curse you with
the eternal insult&mdash;<i>A second Europe</i>.</p>

<p>Starve not genius!</p>

<p>What if it <i>be</i> hard to recognize as good bills and
pure gold. Better to support a hundred lunatics and
loafers in idleness, than to let one earth-born demigod
fly murdered back to Elysium!</p>

<p>But oh, unutterable horror! if the shade of Edgar
Poe&mdash;for example&mdash;should ever meet, upon the
shores of Styx, a ghostly queen of poetry, and she,
fixing her starry gaze on the sombre shade of America's
greatest genius, should murmur gently&mdash;"Me
too, they murdered!"</p>

<p>Can such crimes find atonement or excuse, in lives
by Rufus Griswold, and social slanderers of the
dunces?</p>

<p>"Never more,"&mdash;it is the Raven that answers&mdash;"Never
more!"</p>

</div>

<p>THE very day after Columbia's visit to her step-mother
in the Tombs&mdash;from which that lady was
released on the following day, as it appeared that she
had no knowledge of her husband's doings&mdash;the fair
authoress seated herself at her desk, not to write&mdash;for
she felt too ill, too depressed in mind, too utterly
unhappy to write&mdash;but to calculate. Her only hope
lay in getting payment in advance from some
publisher, and the very demand was risking the
acceptance of the article by the magazine. Yet
what could she do?  Her friend Mrs. Normer was
herself distressed for money. Two of her best rooms
were empty, and already the pretty face of the kind
German was overcast with anxiety and care, for Mrs.
Normer was too generous to be more than prudent,
and unexpected losses had of late impoverished her.</p>

<p>"I am not fit for this world," sighed Columbia,
"its horrible necessities are too much for my lonely
strength. Great evils I can bear, and have borne
with fortitude, but these perpetual stings of fortune's
mosquitoes, this constant dread of to-morrow's contest,
the daily battle for mere existence, kills me more
than even the grief, which is, in a manner, my chosen
companion to the grave. Could I but indulge it in
tranquillity!</p>

<p>"Let the strong-minded ones say what they will, I
feel that woman is destined to lean upon man for
strength, that it is man's highest duty and mission to
sustain her. Oh, how I wish that, but for a single
hour, I could weep upon his heart and then smile
from his arms into those of the great Physician.
Yes I could die now&mdash;willingly, how willingly, if I
could but once more see him, hear him, feel his kiss
upon my lips."</p>

<p>At this moment there was a heavy footstep in the
corridor. The door opened and&mdash;Mondel stood
before her!</p>

<p>For an instant, each of the pale lovers remained
paralyzed by amazement, and half suspected an
illusion of the brain, or a spectral apparition in the
altered countenance before them&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why!&mdash;Mrs. Normer&mdash;told me nothing of this&mdash;she
said my old room was vacant&mdash;and I"&mdash;&mdash;The
bold adventurer paused from excess of emotion.</p>

<p>"I had&mdash;not&mdash;the remotest idea"&mdash;stammered the blonde
poetess, vainly attempting to rise from her seat.</p>

<p>"Columbia," cried Mondel, springing forward and
suddenly clasping the adored shape in his arms, and
kissing her lips before she could even think of resistance,
"My dear, dear love! my adored angel of
hope! spurn me, kill me, if you will! I have felt one
moment of happiness."</p>

<p>"Dudley&mdash;dear Dudley!" said Columbia, and at
length the tears of the fond beauty burst from their
fountains, and she wept long and hysterically in the
arms of her intoxicated lover.</p>

<p>"She called me Dudley!" murmured Mondel, and
he felt as if that one fact was in itself a source of
infinite ecstasy.</p>

<p>"You have returned at last!"</p>

<p>"You desired my return?"</p>

<p>"What else?&mdash;O Dudley, Dudley!"</p>

<p>"My queen!"</p>

<p>"My world!"</p>

<p>"At length we understand one another!"</p>

<p>"Now and for ever."</p>

<div class="center">

<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

</div>

<p>"Well, Mr. Mondel, have you returned a millionaire?"
said Mrs. Normer, when, after as long an
interval as her woman's curiosity would allow, she
at length interrupted the wild whispers of the two
storm-tossed children of genius.</p>

<p>"I always keep my word, madam," replied
Mondel, smiling.</p>

<p>"Seriously?" said Columbia, who amid all her
wild delights, was still under the terror of the spectre
which had so long haunted her.</p>

<p>"Seriously, we are rich beyond <i>my</i> most sanguine
wishes."</p>

<p>"<i>We!</i>" said Columbia, "O, Dudley! what is
wealth between us!&mdash;Yet how glad I am that
it is so! How much I have suffered!"</p>

<p>"True&mdash;it is strange&mdash;you are here. Your father,
your step-mother?"</p>

<p>"My tale is soon told. But first let us hear your
adventures."</p>

<p>"Then, prepare yourselves for a long story!" said
Mondel, and with both Columbia's hands between
his own, and his eyes fixed upon hers, he commenced
a minute relation of those events, with
which the reader is already familiar.</p>

<p>A fortnight later, a young married couple were
seen walking on the sea-shore at &mdash;&mdash;, so radiant
with happiness and hope, that all who saw them
murmured involuntary admiration.</p>

<p>They were Mondel and Columbia.</p>

<p>"After all," said the poet, looking gravely into
the blue eyes of his superb bride, "it is a grand
thing to have suffered!"</p>

<p>"It teaches us, at least," said Columbia, "to sympathize
with all who suffer."</p>

<p>"Angel!" said Mondel, gaily, "you are now an
imperial queen, and I am your subject; what shall
I do to please your majesty?"</p>

<p>"Let me never see talent in distress without
relieving it."</p>

<p>"Granted, dearest, and when we come down
to the lees of my million, a second visit to the
golden island will give us a fresh start."</p>

<p>"By the by, Dudley, what name did you give
to the island?"</p>

<p>"LOVE."</p>

<p>"Oh, what a mockery! what a profanation!"</p>

<p>"Not at all. What was the Isle of Gold but a
material type of my love, which was a power
greater than even gold itself?  I called it LOVE,
because, like love, it seemed an inexhaustible treasure."</p>

<p>"But love and gold are generally antagonistic."</p>

<p>"Not at all. There has been more gold accumulated
by love, than by any other cause. Love is
the spring of life&mdash;the grand motive&mdash;it makes
the world go round, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;in the song."</p>

<p>"And in prose too. However, it is a poor Cupid
who cannot defeat Mammon in single combat!"</p>

<p>"You think love omnipotent?"</p>

<p>"I believe love to be God."</p>

<p>"Oh! what a beautiful shell!"</p>

<p>"Its opening reminds me of your lips."</p>

<p>"There now, you are drawing in the sand with
my parasol again. Dudley, I declare you are getting
quite a monster! this morning you threw my new
shawl on the ground."</p>

<p>"Stop, stop&mdash;that smile is too much for my
philosophy," said Mondel, gazing entranced at the
graceful beauty of his wife.</p>

<p>"Yes, flatterer, to escape being scolded.&mdash;Now
what shall we do next?"</p>

<p>"Suppose we make the tour of Europe and spend
a year in Italy?" said Mondel.</p>

<p>"Delightful! I wish to see everything," said
Columbia.</p>

<p>"I wish to see nothing, but yourself," said Mondel,
playfully.</p>

<p>"Of course, it is your duty to flatter!" said the
fair bride, with an air of mock importance&mdash;and so
they trifled, and were happy. But of course, the
reader does not care for trifling.</p>

<p id="c32">CHAPTER XXXII.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION.</p>

</div>

<p>"WELL, sir," says the curious reader, "well, sir?"</p>

<p>Well, what do you want? says the author.</p>

<p>"Why, I want to know all about it, of course;
what became of the whole pile, the ultimate end of
everybody?"</p>

<p>But this is a modern tale, and modern tales are
not like the old seven volume romances.</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>Why, in the first place, they have no beginning&mdash;</p>

<p>"Proceed, sir."</p>

<p>In the second place, they have no end, they are
in fact all middle.</p>

<p>"And mostly middling," groans the reader, of an
inquiring mind.</p>

<p>No wonder&mdash;they are written by steam.</p>

<p>"Written by steam?"</p>

<p>Yes, my dear sir, or madam. In these fast
times, the nine years' correction of Horace is as
impossible as it is antiquated. Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;, the publisher,
calls in the morning on Mr. N&mdash;&mdash;, the author.</p>

<p>"Mr. N.," says Mr. L., "I wish you would write
me a novel."</p>

<p>"Certainly," says Mr. N., "by what time do you
want it?"</p>

<p>"This week will do," says Mr. L., "I am not at
all in a hurry. Here is a thousand dollars in
advance."</p>

<p>"Thank you," says Mr. N., "here is my note of
hand for a novel, payable seven days after date."</p>

<p>And off goes Mr. L., to engage seven other
authors, to write seven other books.</p>

<p>Mr. N. rings the bell. His black <i>valet-de-chambre</i>
appears, and is dispatched for Mr. Scribblum, Mr.
N.'s private secretary, and one of the fastest short-hand
writers in America.</p>

<p>Mr. Scribblum sits down with a ream of superfine
paper before him.</p>

<p>Mr. N. takes a seventy-five cent cigar, lights it,
takes three turns up and down the room, and begins
dictating his novel at the rate average of one hundred and
fifty words a minute.</p>

<p>Mr. Scribblum takes down the whole verbatim.
In two days the novel is composed. In five more it
is copied out by Scribblum and his clerks, and without
even taking the three days grace accorded to a
promissory note, the work is placed in Mr. L.'s
hands, who sends it by the fastest boy in the establishment
to the printers, who sets a hundred compositors
to set it up; on the following day it is
stereotyped, and within a fortnight from the time of
Mr. L's suggestion, the novel is in the hands of the
reviewers, who blow it up sky-high in the next
morning's papers and, presto! Mr. N. wakes and
finds himself famous, Mr. L becomes a millionaire,
and half a dozen million of readers are made
happy, and write a half a dozen million letters
(luckily prepaid) full of compliments to the author,
who instantly resolves to buy ten square miles of
Texas for a city, call it by his name, and marry the
most beautiful and adorable.</p>

<p>But stay, let us stick to business and not let the cat
out of the bag. Who knows what the wonderfully
successful writer may do about the twenty-four
baskets of love-letters from anonymous heiresses, who
take it for granted that his head is a portrait of himself,
and will not listen for an instant, to the simple
statement that he is a hump-backed dwarf, with a
hare lip; a club foot, one eye, a bald head, and
deeply marked with the small-pox!</p>

<p>But what of that? beauty is only skin deep, and
virtue is the great thing after all. Luckily the
author's reputation as a saint is too firmly established
to need puffing, so further comment is unnecessary.</p>

<p>Having thus let the reader behind the scenes, and
shown our hatred for anything resembling humbug,
we beg further to explain that the modern system of
novel writing is quite correct, and strictly in accordance
with the laws of nature.</p>

<p>It is quite useless to have a beginning unless it be
<i>the</i> beginning, and, as the great Knickerbocker, in his
famous history of New York, has demonstrated, the
beginning of the world itself is involved in considerable
mystery.</p>

<p>Next, it is quite impossible to end a story which is
not yet really ended. So that the reader must be
content to take our romance as a mere slice of the
great pudding of creation, a fragmentary episode in
the history of the world, a leaf torn from the book of
life, in short, and make the most of his bargain.</p>

<p>Yet, as I am of an accommodating disposition, and
have made such a hit with my book&mdash;it sold twenty-five
thousand before it was written, and was much
admired in advance, by several critics who read it
by spiritual manifestation&mdash;I will give a few particulars
which have lately come to my knowledge respecting
the actors in my fragment of a drama, by way
of news items for their acquaintance.</p>

<p>John Berkeley the alterer, counterfeiter, and
speculator in the general line, growing desperate
from his grief at Amelia's infidelity, turned savagely
respectable, went to Australia, started a bank, and as
many a thief in Europe has ended by becoming a
spy, became a highly influential financier, railway
director, and land owner.</p>

<p>Mrs. Berkeley, finding that she had made two
unhappy marriages, declared herself a determined
enemy of the matrimonial institution, and became
successively the guide, philosopher, and friend of a
Roman Catholic bishop, a comic actor, an importer of
hardware, and an editor of a newspaper, which last
facetiously informed her, that though she <i>had</i> "been
the rounds," he considered her a very capital article.
She engaged her friend the editor as part of his duty
to abuse Mondel and his poetry, on all possible occasions,
and notwithstanding Columbia's kindness, told
stories about that angelic woman, which are too
absurd for repetition.</p>

<p>The Professor stuck to Mondel, and devoted all his
energies to the poet's service, acting as his courier
and steward when travelling, and making himself an
indispensable, though always unobtrusive, attendant.
Little did the general European public imagine that
the "distinguished Americans" were attended on by
a man capable of commanding a quarter of a million
of dollars! But every one has his whim, and this was
the Professor's. Mondel's kindness and their voyage
together to the Isle of Gold, bound the ex-robber for
ever to his eccentric Captain.</p>

<p>Nor was the Professor's devotion to the fortunes
of his eccentric leader diminished by the
discovery of his adopted children, in two young
proteges of Columbia, who, having found them
starving in one of the suburbs of New York, had
for many months sustained them, even in her
own direst distress. By the care of Rivers they
were placed at good boarding schools, and it is
not impossible that the pirate's son may live to
be an ornament to his country; and the pirate's
daughter, the belle of some future season. Wonderful
is the meeting of extremes on the great web
of Destiny. Man tries to disentangle its threads&mdash;gives
up the fruitless task, observes, accepts, and wonders.</p>

<p>Confidence Bob, who only had three wives,
besides one in Canada, one in New England, and
one in New Jersey&mdash;went to Texas, and married
the daughter of a great man in &mdash;&mdash;, who, as
he confidently told his son-in-law, originally emigrated
to the old Texan republic, because "he
had the cursed misfortune in Arkansaw, to hold
a fellow just three minutes too long by the throat,
one day in a rough and tumble hog fight." Bob
became a member of the bar, and hoped to be
one of the Legislature, eventually, and was considered
"some" down there, though not quite a
fighting man of the first water.</p>

<p>The Slinker eventually slunk into a small retail
business, and kept a corner grocery in the Eighth
Avenue.</p>

<p>The most noble and illustrious Fitzgammon
O'Bouncer, after many assaults repulsed, did <i>not</i>
capture Miss Candlesoap after all. He fell in love
with and married a pretty actress of Flicflac's
theatre, and finally became a most brilliant writer of
comedies&mdash;especially French translations, and was,
with the slight drawback of being perpetually "hard
up"&mdash;(so hard up, that some cruel wag took him off
in P&mdash;&mdash;'s magazine, in an article under that envious
title), a very successful and much admired man of
letters. He often regretted, when carrying the carpet
bag containing his wife's costume to the theatre,
that he had sacrificed to love the chances of the
great Candlesoap alliance. But it was not to be.
Fate determined that O'Bouncer should be hard up,
and despite all loans, and all editorships, farces, and
blank verse to the contrary, hard up he remained, so
far as intelligence has been received by telegraph at
the office of this novel, up to the time of going to
press.</p>

<p>Peregrine Cope took his share of the golden
remnant and went back to Paris, the city of his love,
where he occupied a grand hotel in the Quartier St.
Germain, and married a lovely widow, the brilliant
Comtesse de Henry. He was one of the esoteric
contributors to Alexande Dumas's <i>Mousquetaire</i>,
and published here a work on France and the
French, which electrified his countrymen. His
"Voyage to the Golden Island" is also a very
popular book of travels.</p>

<p>Mrs. Normer, enriched by Mondel's gratitude,
married a Major in the U. S. Army, who had long
sought her hand, and lived very happily with her
husband, who luckily had "faith in dreams," and
raised no objection to prophecies. But she never
lost an opportunity of recounting to every new
auditor the wonderful romance of her two literary
tenants, their misfortunes, their love and ultimate
prosperity. Nor did she ever fail on the first of
every month to write Mondel and Columbia a letter
full of the kindest wishes and the most playful
humor.</p>

<p>Of the further adventures of Mondel and Columbia
themselves I shall not pretend to speak. Their
happiness I leave to the imagination of those who,
like them, have loved and loved grandly, with the
whole force of their being and the whole passion of
their souls.</p>
