<h2>PREFACE </h2>

</div>

<p>SLAVERY, with its manifold evils and wrongs, is becoming
more and more the theme of the statesman, the divine, the
poet, and the writer of fiction. It matters little in forming its
estimate, whether there has or has not been exaggeration in
describing the details of its workings, as it concerns either the
master or his bondsman. It is sufficient to know, that it originated

<!--- vol 1 page iv -->

in and is sustained under, a very low estimate of the value
of man as man, and that the exalted Christian idea of the
brotherhood of the race can be but dimly discerned by any one,
who is willing for one moment, to own a human being. It
follows, therefore, that in a system where contempt for humanity
unites with irresponsible power, the most vivid imagination may
fail to delineate truly all its horrors.</p>

<p>As the material globe which we inhabit, was originally spoken
into a rude and imperfect being, its thorough completion being
left to humanity, that, by becoming co-workers with God, we
might be brought more and more into union with Him and his
wonderful designs, so does Society expand and perfect itself by
little and little, in unison with it. We may lament over its dull
perception of truth, its slow growth towards perfect maturity,
and the worldly and weak in faith, will be ready to despair of
its eventual freedom from bondage to evil. Not so does our
Maker, who knows the abundant resources of his creation, and
the fitting time when each material shall best adapt itself to its
highest and most appropriate use.</p>

<p>When the waste places of the earth have been subdued by
the energy and force of the stronger races, and the rude powers
of nature are trained to do their bidding, when by the aid of
machinery, men are set comparatively free from the harder drudgery
of life, then, to those who, by fidelity in duty have earned
the high and glad privilege, there comes the play-time of their
being, when the higher faculties which adorn and beautify life,
will be in the ascendant. Then come up to the surface of
society, those who have been regarded as inferior elements in
its construction, even those <i>little ones in Christ's kingdom</i>, in
whom the feminine, the graceful and tender, the imaginative and
artistic qualities are largely mingled. Then, woman will be
freed from the chains which enthrall her, and will step forth as
she is, the subtle, spiritual genius, to impel to high deeds the

<!--- vol 1 page v -->

"lord of creation." Then the African, child of the sunshine, in
whom is wrapped up what we, in our country, have as yet
vainly looked for&mdash;poetry, music, high art, and the full reflection
of God's love as revealed through our Saviour, will take his true
and blissful position.</p>

<p>The worldly and selfish will, for a time, scoff and disbelieve
this, as they laugh at the struggles of woman to reach her high
destiny; but the unwelcome truth will be, at last, forced upon
them, that they have been acting out the fable of the drayman
towards Pegasus, on a fearful and monstrous scale.</p>

<p>It is time that the world should know of the glorious
appointment which God has in store for these his children
upon whom his hand for the ages has been most heavily laid;
for, from the laboratory of every imaginable calamity and
woe, the fitting alembic through the action of his divine
chemistry for his choicest productions, there shall spring up
and bloom the loveliest, the most celestial, the most sky-scented
flower of humanity, which the world has yet seen. On them
will devolve the supremacy of the ages, and it will be their joyful
destiny to evolve light out of darkness, to wind up the
horologe of the present, and set it to the musical dance of the
hours of the approaching Future. And to one whose soul's
eye has become couched to discern this high lot of the feminine
element, all apology seems futile for offering to the public
the following Tale; for, as the winds of Heaven scatter
the leaves of the trees when they are ripened for the fall,
so, through a strong conviction, do the thoughts drop from
the pen, and they are scattered wherever they find a soil fitted
to vitalize them. And with faith in the welcome which words
expressed from a full and glowing heart will receive, do I
offer it to all generous and truth-loving Americans, whatever
may be their nativity or race.</p>

<h2>ZO&Euml;:</h2>

<p>OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

</div>

<div class="small">

<p>"No manna falls around me from on high;<br/>

Barely from off the desert of my life<br/>

I gather patience and severe content.</p>

<p>* * * * * *</p>

<p>A mighty purpose rises large and slow,<br/>

From out the fluctuations of my soul.<br/>

As ghost-like, from the dim and tumbling sea,<br/>

Starts the completed moon."</p>

<p>ALEXANDER SMITH.</p>

<br/>

</div>

<p>THE story of Zo&euml; Carlan, a young
colored girl, of the little Danish
island of Santa Cruz, is a pathetic
illustration of the false position into
which a refined and educated nature
may be thrown, by the fierce
prejudices of caste and color.</p>

<p>Her father, George Carlan, was
a native of the island, and originally a slave. His

<!--- vol 1 page 10 -->

ancestry on the father's side for two generations had been
whites, so that with his light complexion, he combined
much of the energy and restiveness under despotic rule
of the Anglo-Saxon race.</p>

<p>Slavery under the Danes had some mild and alleviating
features. Schools were supported by government, in
which the rudiments of knowledge were taught the slaves,
with a view to their eventual freedom, and provisions were
made, by which it could be purchased by those who would
employ the requisite exertion.</p>

<p>George so diligently used these means, that at the age
of twenty-eight, he stepped forth under the clear vault of
Heaven, a free man. He could but imperfectly read and
write and cast accounts; and he reasoned thus with himself.
"Here I am, with none to rule over me but my God
and my King. Independence and influence I will have,
but how to gain them is the question. I am too old to
educate myself; but rich I may become, and rich I will be.
I will take my stand beside the haughty whites, and whatever
consideration and power may be mine through wealth,
I will attain."</p>

<p>Through his industry and perseverance, he had become
a successful merchant; and at the time when this story
commences, he was living in the enjoyment of not only
the comforts, but many of the luxuries of life. On attaining
his freedom, he married a young colored woman, of
much gentleness and native refinement of character, and
one child, the little Zo&euml;, was given them, to be the light
of their home, and the object of all his aspiring hopes and
desires.</p>

<p>But the free blacks and colored people (for that distinction
is very carefully made in the islands), though experiencing
much favor from the Danish government, and
sometimes even preferred to the proud and discontented
white colonists, when indulgences are to be awarded, have
no <i>position</i> in society. In the first place, the latter are,

<!--- vol 1 page 11 -->

for the most part, the children of illicit connections, and
where is the community where the odium of such sin falls
not upon the weaker party and her innocent offspring?
Then the people of color are a continual source of contention
and trouble; they are restless, discontented, aspiring.
For every step they advance higher than the full black,
they cast behind them a glance of indifference or of scorn,
while they are ever looking upward and striving to plant
their feet side by side with the whites, if not in advance
of them. This is met with unflinching opposition by the
dominant race. In all spheres within their control, they
omit not to give the most scathing demonstrations of their
contempt. In social life they seldom meet, of course. It
is, however, the custom for the Danish governor-general to
hold levees, from time to time; and to these the chief mulattoes
are invited as well as the whites. Gladly would the
latter excuse themselves from the honor of attendance,
knowing the odious companionship to which they will be
subjected, but it is well understood that an invitation is
equivalent to a command, and policy, perchance safety,
forbids a refusal. There is by no means a very cordial
feeling between many of them and their rulers. The
population is a mixed one. Many of the old and more
wealthy families are of English descent. Their religion
is only tolerated, the Lutheran being that of the State.
Almost all offices are held by Danish officials, often unscrupulous
and grasping, and the Creoles are made to feel
in numberless ways, that they are but step-children to the
mother-country, and that their interests are ever second to
her own. Then, more than all other causes of jealousy,
is the slackening of their control over the blacks, by the
measures of the home-government. They see in it their
humiliation and ruin; and as prudence forbids a very open
expression of their outraged feelings to their rulers, they
display a temper all the more bitter towards the immediate
cause of them.</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 12 -->

<p>In this scene of unrest, ambitious striving, and corroding
sentiment the little Zo&euml; was born and lived until her
seventh year. It was then that her father felt that the time
had come to carry into execution the idea which, from the
first moment that his eye rested on the face of his infant
child, had been as fixed as if the fates had commanded it.
This was, to send her from the island to be educated. It
was a common custom of the white Creoles to do so; but
few, who had the means, were willing to confine their
children to the very slender advantages for culture, which
the island afforded, and though the temporary exile was
fraught with much peril and heart-sickness, it was submitted
to as a painful necessity. For through most of the
forming period of their children's minds, they were given
over to the care of teachers too distant from them to exercise
much superintendence, while the intercourse by letter
even was too infrequent to retain a very strong hold over
their affections and characters. To this fact may be attributed
very much of the feeling of exile which the Creole
carries about with him to his grave. Seldom is the island
spoken of as a home, but that endeared appellation is given
to Denmark, Germany, England, the United States; and
this use of language is imitated by those who have never
stepped beyond its boundaries.</p>

<p>George had often spoken of his intention of sending
Zo&euml; to Denmark, but the distant idea of it always distressed
his wife so much that he delayed the final announcement
of it as long as possible. She had but little of his proud,
ambitious spirit or intellectual thirst, but lived chiefly in
her affections. She was but a child in mind, and while her
heart could lavish its love upon her husband and child&mdash;while
she could wander with them through her favorite
haunts and breathe in the luxurious sensations imparted
by the delicious climate and gorgeous nature around her&mdash;she
was happy and contented.</p>

<p>One evening, as they were seated in the verandah of

<!--- vol 1 page 13 -->

their dwelling, which overlooked the Caribbean sea, the
refreshing trade-wind gently waving the leaves of the
tamarind tree, and the delicate odor of the star-jasmine
wafted to them on its breath from the abundant blossoms
over their heads, George was aroused from the abstraction
into which he had fallen by a laugh from his wife.</p>

<p>"See, George," she said, "how oddly Zo&euml;'s goat looks
with that wreath of flowers which she has tied about its
face! Is she not like some old, withered belle trying to
look young and pretty?" and Nanny, as if aware of her
ridiculous appearance, suddenly flung herself away from the
child, turning her a somerset, as she did so, down the slope.</p>

<p>"Yes," said her father, but not joining in the mirth; and
then more to himself than to his wife, he added: "Zo&euml; is
very fond of the animal. It shall go with her on the voyage;
it will serve to divert her, and besides will furnish her
with milk."</p>

<p>"What voyage? what do you mean?" said Sophia, seizing
his arm and gazing eagerly into his face.</p>

<p>"Now, Sophia, be calm and listen to me," said he, "you
know what my desire and purpose is, and I want you to
look at the matter as I do."</p>

<p>"I cannot. O George! I know you have spoken of
sending her away, but I never believed you would have the
courage, when the time came, or," she added, in a lower
tone, "that you would be so cruel to me."</p>

<p>"Heaven knows what it costs me," throwing his arm
tenderly around her, "even more on your account than my
own; but do you wish her to grow up like Mahala and
Jenny&mdash;your brother's daughters&mdash;ignorant and impure,
with no higher wish than to be the mistress of some white
coxcomb? No, I would see her die first."</p>

<p>"But she will not: am I like them? You saved me from
that fate, dearest, and will not your own child, with you to
instruct her, with my eye ever upon her, be even happier
and more worthy of her father than I am?"</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 14 -->

<p>"I teach her," said he, bitterly, "who, (thanks to my
slavery for that) know nothing myself!"</p>

<p>"But you do know a great deal," said she, brightening
a little, and casting a proud glance at his handsome face;
"I have not told you what I heard the American merchant
say to Captain Sturd, yesterday, while I was standing in
your counting-room at the store."</p>

<p>"Well, what was it, dear?" said George, willing to divert
her a moment from her grief.</p>

<p>"He said that there was not a more gentlemanly fellow,
nor a better business man on the island than yourself, nor
one that he liked to deal with so well."</p>

<p>"I dare say," said George; "but I know just what such
compliments are worth, coming from a white man, and I
value them accordingly. But what has that to do with
Zo&euml;'s going away, if not this, that if I have risen above
my people in any respect, so much the more must I see to
it, that my child does not grow up good for nothing but a
slave's degraded life, though she may not literally be one?
No, Sophia, life is too dark, too hard for me with my ignorance
and sense of humiliation, not to wish for our darling
a better fate. She shall be educated as a lady, and who
knows," said he, his eye gleaming, "but the tables may
be turned a little before she comes back, and people be
seated a little more according to their deserts?"</p>

<p>"It frightens me to see you so ambitious, George. Why
not be contented and happy in us, as we are in you, and
let the world go on as it will?"</p>

<p>"Well, love, I will. You and Zo&euml; are my life. Will
you not, with me, make a sacrifice for her best good, and
prove to me your love by being happy with me alone for a
few years? Were we not happy together the three years
before her birth? and shall we be less so now? You are
not like me if your love has weakened with time. Has it,
Sophia?" and he drew her toward him.</p>

<p>These words, and the sad and tender tone in which they

<!--- vol 1 page 15 -->

were spoken, by one not very demonstrative in his feelings,
quite subdued her. She leaned upon his shoulder and
wept, but softly and without bitterness. "Her husband's
love&mdash;the good of her child," these were the open Sesame
to her heart's most guarded treasure, when against the
claims of intellect or ambition she would have turned a
tiger's resistance.</p>

<p>O man, thou hast no lore in woman's nature, it matters
not of what clime or color, for it is one and the same in
this, if thou hast not learned the very point of the rock
which is to be smitten for its waters to gush forth for you.
"Her husband's love! The good of her child!"</p>

<p>ALL was now busy preparation with
them for the little girl's departure.
Captain Heiliger was to return to
Denmark in a month, in the good
ship Skager-rack, and his wife, who
had been spending the winter in
Santa Cruz, very willingly consented
to take charge of her. The
Captain had many business transactions
with Mr. Carlan, and great
good-will had grown up between
them, and he was very glad of an
opportunity of reciprocating some favors which he had
conferred upon him in the way of trade.</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 17 -->

<p>Many were the tears shed by Sophia as she diligently
stitched upon Zo&euml;'s wardrobe, but George saw that she
struggled hard to be reconciled to the separation, and he
redoubled his affectionate efforts for her happiness. As
for Zo&euml;, childlike, one hour she cried at the thought of
leaving her parents and going alone among strangers, and
the next, was impatient for the day to come when she
should sail upon the great ocean, and see all the wonders
of the country far away, of which her friend the captain,
often gave her glimpses in his narrations of northern life
and scenes. It came at last all too soon for Sophia, and
no less for George, whose sterner nature was first put in
action by his own firm resolves, and by the necessity of
conquering his wife's opposition to the plan; but, these
victories won, the strong man betrayed the tender heart
underneath all this bravery, and, at the last, turned to his
wife for the courage and support which had come to her
through patience, submission, and disinterested love.</p>

<p>Once on board ship, the first agony of tears over, the
busy preparations for sailing going on, holding Nanny, the
pet goat, by the brightest ribbon her mother could find in
Fredericstadt, Zo&euml; stood, interested and quiet, if not
happy. She reserved her next burst of sorrow for bedtime,
that fearful hour, when, if there is a grief in a child's
heart, it surges up and breaks over all the bounds within
which deference for others, or passing sports or occupations
had temporarily confined it. Sleep, blessed friend,
comes at last, to relieve the inconsolable one, and no less
the impotent, unhappy sympathizer, who ranges the heavens
and earth and the waters beneath for some antidote in
the shape of story, suggestion, or joke, to allay the tempest.
When all hope is failing, and the hands are folded
in mute despair, lo, more welcome than the friendly sail
or life-boat in a storm at sea, is caught the first glimmer
of relief in the drooping eyelid, and soon the occasional

sob is all that tells of the dark clouds which had so shut
in over the "Heaven of its infancy."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; found no lack of employment or of friends on board.
A child on ship is a god-send, for in no other so small a
compass, do you get so much variety and freshness combined
to break the tedium and monotony of a voyage. She
was soon at home in every part of it; knew the exact latitude
and longitude of the kitchen, pantry, cowhouse, hencoop,
and especially did she make minute investigation
into Nanny's quarters, to see that all was right with her
favorite.</p>

<p>She became an apt pupil in learning the terms in use
among the sailors, and larboard and starboard, main-sail
and top-sail, stem and stern, were soon familiar lore to her.
For the child is your true democrat. The world is all
before her, free from the conventionalisms, which build
such high walls between her elders, and love and companionship
go where natural affinity leads. Greater than
a sovereign, too, does this Heaven-directed freedom make
her, for all hearts become willing subjects to love, and
there is no smack of worldly policy or thrift in the service
which such love wins.</p>

<p>Sophia would have been frightened enough to have seen
her child threading her way through what would seem to
her, very dangerous places, now running up and down the
steep gangway, now leaning over the railing, now mounting
up into the binnacle, and anon, down in the engine-room,
with the sooty Vulcan himself. But apart from the
self-reliance and sureness of foot gained by being suffered
to depend somewhat on herself, "there were angels in
charge over her" wherever she went. At one time, it was
a lonely papa, who as he took the little hand to help her
up a step, did it all the more tenderly for thinking of his
own cherubs far, far away. At another, it was an invalid
lady, who in saving her from a fall, sighed that

<!--- vol 1 page 19 -->

before the weary weeks should bear her to her own
blue-eyed darlings, she might be sleeping beneath the
waves. And again, it was an honest tar, who "sooner
than see harm come to such a trim, pretty little craft,
shiver his timbers&mdash;he would be blown himself, he
would." And nothing of interest in sea, sky, or ship,
was thought to have fulfilled "its order of entertainment,"
until she had enjoyed her share of it. The
cry was, "Zo&euml;, see this whale spouting in the distance;"
or, "Zo&euml;, look at this troop of horses galloping through
the sea," and surely it took two or three good glances
with her bright eyes to see that they were only porpoises,
jumping and floundering through the waters. Then the
silvery flying-fish, with its brief spasmodic soarings into
the blue ether, engaged her attention and sympathy too,
when it was told her that it was impelled out of its natural
element for the moment only, to escape the jaws of some
pursuing monster. But her greatest delight was to lean
over the guards at evening, and watch the phosphorescent
light upon the waves, which the ship parted in its course.
Its silvery sheen, now brightening, now fading, and flowing
about the keel like grains of molten sunlight, had a
fascination for the child which she did not willingly forego.
Undaunted by warnings of dampness and chilly evening
winds, she would beg that she might be permitted to look
"just for one hour," and if she could not persuade my
lady to come from the cabin and share with her the
sight and her fur cloak together, why, she was just as
happy and comfortable too, under a corner of Tom's pea-jacket
at the forecastle.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; was neither a very beautiful nor a vivacious child,
but she was interesting from her gentleness and grace, and
thoughtfulness for others. She was too diffident and
shrinking to show fondness excepting to the long-known,
but she had many unobtrusive little ways of testifying gratitude
and affection. She had that delicate touch in

<!--- vol 1 page 20 -->

smoothing a sick one's pillow, that instinctive knowledge
when any little service is wanted, which made her like a
ministering spirit to the languid and sea-sick, and when
she found that her goat's milk was considered a luxury,
the largest share of it was sure to be transferred to where
it was most wanted.</p>

<p>She was of the grade of quadroons, and her features
were pure and intellectual in their contour. One skillful
in such criticism could see that there was a mingling of the
African in her physique, but nevertheless she was a fair
and agreeable-looking child. Her hair was black, wavy,
and abundant, her eyes soft and dark, her face oval and
delicate in its form; but over it there was that mysterious
pensiveness quite common to her caste, and visible even in
the face of the full African; a peculiarity which may be
explained by those who imagine he is insensible to the
evils of his condition, and would fain delude themselves
that he is joyous and happy under its hardships. Does the
difference of expression arise from the greater fragility of
constitution said to be inherent in the mixed race, or is it
a prophecy or a fulfillment of the bitter struggle of the
spirit which in all of them is to be wrought out by groans
and tears, but in the full black may be somewhat relieved
by a naturally happier temperament?</p>

<p>The favor in which she was held on board was not
stinted on account of her race. The few passengers were
Germans, Swedes, and Danes, and it is well known they
are comparatively free from our aversion to the African.
When living with them in the islands as a Pariah race, they
are not proof against the influences which slavery always
engenders in the irreligious and sensual, and in consequence
learn to regard them with a degree of contempt,
which would be entirely unfelt were the black elevated to
his rightful condition; but the individuals who go, from
time to time, to Europe to be educated, are petted, and a
vail of fancy and romance thrown around them which

<!--- vol 1 page 21 -->

raises them rather above the common level in the esteem
of their fellows.</p>

<p>With the quick wit and freemasonry of childhood, Zo&euml;
soon learned who her best friends were, and especially
with Carl, the man at the wheel, did she establish an intimacy,
for, besides a kind smile and a merry or pleasant
greeting as she approached him, she found he had a rich
storehouse of tales to narrate. Though somewhat broken
and disjointed by his duties at his post, she could gather
from them rich store for her world of day-dreams. Carl
was perfectly at home in elf-land, for he told her he was a
"Sunday child," which gave him great privileges with the
little people dwelling there, and the elves of light and the
elves of darkness he knew like a book; for to all Sunday
children they were visible. Often in herding his cows in
Denmark, just at evening had he seen the good little white
elves playing hide-and-go-seek among the leaves of the
trees over his head, or dancing in the elf-dans; that is, the
brightest and greenest spots in the meadows. But with
the little black elves, who lived underground and under
houses, he had to put on his best manners or there would
be trouble enough, ay, and his good wife, too, must see to
it, that her house was kept cleanly and neat or she would
have plenty of tricks played upon her. Her butter would
fail to come, or the cows would hold up their milk, or more
vexatious than all, when she tried to spin her linen thread,
it would snap as if the fire had touched it. But if everything
was in good order, they were sure to reward her.
Sometimes in the morning she would find her nice cream-cheese
all ready pressed without her having to put a hand
to it, or her clothes would be all washed and laid out on
the dewy grass, or the table all laid for supper, if she
stepped out to gossip a little with a neighbor.</p>

<p>But he had to be very careful not to let his cattle graze
where the elf-people have been, for they have one bad
habit&mdash;they spit&mdash;and if the cows should graze there they

<!--- vol 1 page 22 -->

would die, unless his wife had been prudent enough to
raise some John's-wort, saved on that saint's day, and it
was near at hand.</p>

<p>However, he had learned that when he went to the pasture,
if he would but say, "Thou little Troll, may I graze
my cows on thy hill?" no harm ever came to them, not
even if the great blue cattle of the elves came out to feed
with them, for they only wanted a little deference from
others to be civil in return.</p>

<p>But better than all, did she like to hear about the Hill
people who were not elves, neither were they human, but
half between; although when they appear, they are like
handsome men and women. As their name denotes, they
live in the caves and hills, and he had often put his ear to
the ground and heard their music. It was very sweet and
lively, but if any one was so cruel as to breathe a word of
doubt about their ever going to heaven, the singing would
cease, and there would be such weeping and lamentation
as to quite break his heart to hear it; for through all time
they carry about with them a longing, but faint hope of
salvation.</p>

<p>"O Carl!" Zo&euml; would say, "God will let them go to
heaven, won't he? What have they done, that he should
not?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I hope so; but don't cry about it, little
maiden, or I can tell you no more about them."</p>

<p>She hastily wiped away her tears and begged for
another story.</p>

<p>So he went on: "One evening, just at twilight, I was
sitting in my door-way with my old wife, resting after my
day's work, when I heard the sound of my neighbor Johan's
fiddle. Now Johan was a rare fiddler, but somewhat
given to mischief, and he had often said that he knew how
to play the elf-king's tune, and that he meant to try it some
day. 'Johan,' said I, 'thou hadst better not, for thou wilt
rue it if thou dost.' But sure enough, when I heard his

<!--- vol 1 page 23 -->

fiddle that night, I knew that he had acted upon his threat.
Down the road he came, playing as if he were the elf-king
himself, and with him a crowd of men and women and
little children, all dancing as if they were mad; for when
that tune is played, all who hear it must dance whether
they will or not. Up jumped my poor old wife, who had
not taken a step for many a day; and such antics as she
cut up were a sight to behold. But no need for me to
laugh at her, for though I had much rather have gone to
bed than to join the whirligig, I could not be let off, but
was forced to join the crazy crowd. And that was not the
worst of it, for out came my wife's spinning-wheel and up
jumped my plow, and then the tables and chairs set to
flying, so that it seemed as if the world was turning topsy-turvy
altogether. 'Play the tune backward, you evil carl!'
I shouted to Johan, but the good-for-nothing fellow had
forgotten it; for if he could do that, he could then stop
playing. So we whirled and capered until the breath was
nearly gone from us, and Johan himself was as red in the
face as his jacket, when I bethought me to take my knife
and go behind him and cut the strings of his fiddle. If I
had not done this, or if Johan had not bethought him how
to play the tune backward, we should have danced till this
time. And that was the last, I think, of Johan's trying to
play the elf-king's tune."</p>

<p>"Carl, was that a really true story, or did you make
believe it so?" said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>Carl hemmed and cocked his eye, and said, "there were
a great many more wonderful things than that in the
world," and gave the wheel a vigorous turn, singing, as he
did so, a snatch of a Danish ballad.</p>

<p>So Zo&euml; had no lack of entertainment to her liking, and
her appetite was insatiable. Her favorite hour for the
feast was just at evening, when the captain would permit
her to lead Nanny out for an airing, and after running a
race with her up and down the deck, she would take her

<!--- vol 1 page 24 -->

stand near her friend, her arm thrown around her goat's
neck, her eyes upturned to Carl, while Nanny, meantime
seeming pleased to serve as her support, chewed her cud&mdash;
the two making as pretty a contrast as need be seen of
contented animalism and earnest mind.</p>

<p>Carl had to draw pretty largely on his invention to satisfy
her cravings, for, although his stock of the legends and
superstitions of his country was ample, such an extravagant
draught might have exhausted even that. But he
was seldom at a loss, for, although to look at his rough,
weather-beaten, stolid face, one would as soon expect to
find a white lily growing out of a cabbage, or ottar of rose
exhaling from a rough oak knot, as fancy or imagination in
him, yet he had both.</p>

<p>These northern nations of Europe, Germans, Danes,
Swedes, etc., are a queer people&mdash;a strange blending of
sour-krout and nightingales' tongues, lager-beer and nectar,
mercury and lead, soot and sunbeam, or any other combination
of the most incongruous elements which might
be suggested to the imaginative.</p>

<p>Here is Carl's story of the Enchanted Lady, or the little
Flying Fish:</p>

<p>"One evening at twilight, as I was standing at the helm,
the new moon just over my right shoulder&mdash;where I like to
have it&mdash;with no voice about me but the washing of the
waves, as the ship parted them in its course&mdash;for the passengers,
with their noisy gabble, had gone into the saloon&mdash;I
heard a splash in a tub of water near me. This tub Jack had
brought and set in an out of-the-way place, to be ready for
him to holystone the deck with, bright and early in the
morning. Well, as I was saying, I heard something splash
into it, and I looked and saw that it was a beautiful little
silvery flying-fish. Thought I to myself, you have made a
lucky hit that time, my little heartie, for if you had landed
on the dry deck, if you had not broken your head, you
would have been rather out of breath by this time, for this is

<!--- vol 1 page 25 -->

thinner air than you like. I gave but little heed to it, but
let it stay, knowing that the poor little thing would, at least,
be out of the way of its enemy, the dolphin, though it was
rather snug quarters for one that was used to having the
sea to range in. By-and-by it was Tom's time to take the
helm, and I turned into my berth to get a bit of sleep, and
did not come up again till six bells sounded in the
morning.</p>

<p>"As I stood tending the wheel with one hand, and rubbing
my eyes with the other&mdash;for one needs a little sunlight
to wake up easy&mdash;I thought I heard some one call
my name. It was not like a common voice, speaking low,
but the tiniest little grasshopper one, calling as loud as it
could. Thinks I to myself, I must be in dream-land, for
who ever called 'Carl' like that, in the wide-awake world.
So I scratched my head hard, and pinched my arm, and
tossed up my cap in the air, to be sure that I was up and
dressed, but seeing nobody I went to my post. A second
call, and this time, a splash in the tub, and then I remembered
the flying-fish. I thought I must be mistaken about
the voice, but said to myself, 'the little thing is discontented,
and no wonder; I'll e'en put it into the sea again.'</p>

<p>"As I was taking it in my hand, it cried out: 'Let me
stay, Carl, I want to talk with you a bit.'</p>

<p>" 'That's it, is it?' said I. 'Who ever heard of a flying-fish
spinning a yarn? But what shall I do; I can't leave the
wheel, for where do you think the ship would drift? and
my old ears are too thick to hear your little fairy speech at
this distance? However, I'll pull the tub nearer the helm.
There, now: what on earth are you? And what can I do
for you?'</p>

<p>"The little flying-fish squeaked out: 'I am an enchanted
lady, and my name is Skada. I am the wife of the great
giant, Krymer, who lives in Jotunheim, away up toward
the north-pole among the eternal snows and icebergs. He
is very grim and imperious, and with him I led a hard and

<!--- vol 1 page 26 -->

slavish life. I was the daughter of King Olaf, and was
haughty and proud. I was handsome and witty, and liked
to be seen and heard&mdash;and who had a better right, being
a king's daughter? I could not abide to stay at home and
nurse the children, and cook my greedy lord's fifty fishes,
and three reindeer, and five turtles, and one white bear,
which he consumed every day at dinner. I thought myself
as great as he, being a princess, and with as good a right
to share in his rule over the dwarfs, who were his subjects.
And this I told him; but all the answer I got from him
was, 'Can you lift my hammer and throw it like that?' and
away it flew and took off the whole top of the mountain
Utgardelok, which fell plump into the sea, throwing so
much water into the air that it rained for five days. I had
to confess that I could not; and what was the use when the
ground was so moist already with the melting snow that
nothing would grow, and I told him so. 'Can you shout
as long and as loud as I can?' And with that he raised
such a hideous yell, that the trees all fell flat, and my poor
little flowers, that I was trying to nurse into life and beauty
by gently blowing upon them with my warm breath, all
shrunk back into the earth, thinking that the safest place
for them. 'No,' I said, 'and the less noise the better,
for then something would be done, or at least, there would
be less destruction.'</p>

<p>" 'Have you courage to go through Utgard, and contend
with Loke and his three evil children, Fenris, the wolf,
Jormungandur, the great serpent, and Hela, the queen of
death?'</p>

<p>" 'No, and why should I? If I keep clear of them, they
will never trouble me. Let them have their dark kingdom
to themselves.'</p>

<p>" 'Then you are not fit to rule,' said Krymer, which did
not convince me, being no reason at all. So one day I took
the scepter, and was brandishing it about when Krymer
came in. He was as angry as the north-wind in a tempest.

<!--- vol 1 page 27 -->

and without waiting a moment for his wrath to cool, turned
me into a flying-fish and threw me into the sea, where I
am compelled to live for a score of years.' "</p>

<p>"What a cross, cruel, ill-tempered husband," said Zo&euml;;
"but did not she tell you what she saw down deep in the
sea?"</p>

<p>"O yes, you may be sure she did, I thought she would
never be done talking of the mountains higher than any
on the land; of the green meadows which lie at their base;
of the waving forests; of the huge ferns a thousand feet
long, with their brilliant foliage of crimson and purple, and
the beautiful pink and green turf, and sea-weeds and
lichens, which they overshadow. And she told of the vast
monsters&mdash;the whale, the huge kraken, the sea-serpent,
and countless hosts of smaller tribes, who dart and gambol,
or pursue their prey a mile below the surface of the sea;
of the myriads upon myriads of salmon and mackerel and
herring, which migrate from one side of the world to the
other, disturbing the current of the mighty ocean itself.
But more beautiful was what she told of the wonderful
working of the little coral insects, who patiently pursue
their labor from year to year, forming their delicate and
frost-like sprays, blooming at their summits with insect
life, which become the basis of great continents and islands
in the midst of the waters.</p>

<p>"But many a sad sight too, was beneath the briny
waves; noble ships, with their untold treasures of gold
and silver, and rich merchandise, and what was sadder
still, beautiful women and children clasped in each other's
arms, and strong men with the marks of the death-wrestle
still upon their faces."</p>

<p>"Please tell me no more about that," said the child,
heaving a deep sigh, "but what became of the little lady
flying-fish?"

<p>"Well, after she had spun her yarn, and a pretty long
one it was, she said that it was time for her to go back

<!--- vol 1 page 28 -->

again, for she was afraid if Jack should see her when he
came to clean the deck, that he would seize and cook her
for his breakfast. So she begged me to give her a lift over
the side of the ship."</p>

<p>" 'I will, my heartie,' said I, 'but in return for making
the night so short with your pretty talk, I want to give you
a word of advice.'</p>

<p>" 'O yes, by all means,' said the fish, fluttering her fin a
little, by way of a courtesy, 'what is it?'</p>

<p>" 'When the time comes for you to go back to the old
giant, don't seize the scepter again, for it is an ugly, heavy,
old thing, and you will stagger under it, and it would be a
sorry sight if it should trip you up before your subjects
and throw you flat upon the ground. <i>But if you are
indeed a princess and no sham, your rank will shine out,</i>
though you are dressed in cat skins instead of sable, and
you will share the rule, for the dwarfs know who is who,
and you will get rid of the trouble of the heavy scepter.
Let the giant keep it if he wants a plaything, you are not
a baby. Will you heed what I say?'</p>

<p>" 'Ay, ay, and thank you. I can take a hint and act
upon it too. It is stupid old Krymer, whose skull is so
thick, that he thinks that it is only a leaf falling when
Thor's thunderbolt comes down upon it.'</p>

<p>" 'Tut, tut,' said I, 'little lady, be a little less free with
your liege lord, when you speak about him.'</p>

<p>" 'Never fear, I shall remember what you say; I only
want to make his ear burn once like fire with my sharp
words, for turning me into a flying-fish, and then I will ever
after be as mild as a May morning, and docile as a dove.'</p>

<p>"The little fish spread its gauzy fins, laughing as it
did so, at its own merry speech, which sounded like tiny
silver bells, until it darted out of sight under the water."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Carl, that is the funniest story you have
told me yet, all but that about the mothers and their poor
little babies;" and Zo&euml;'s eager glance was dimmed as it

<!--- vol 1 page 29 -->

turned upon her own world of dreams, and she was lost
for the time being to the one about her.</p>

<p>Thus the time sped on, and even a long voyage comes
to an end at last; and there was hurry and bustle on board
ship again as the city of Copenhagen loomed up in the
distance.</p>

<p>To Zo&euml;, accustomed as she was to the perennial verdure
of her own sunny isle and to the low style of architecture
which its exposure to hurricanes rendered necessary, the
sight of the brown earth, the leafless trees (for it was now
March), the high buildings and tall steeples, was a great
subject of amusement. She knelt upon her berth to look
out of her port-hole, as it was too cold to stay on deck,
while Koma, the servant of Mrs. Heiliger, packed her
trunk and dressed her in readiness to go to the city.
When she was arrayed to the girl's mind, Zo&euml; took her
hand to go and bid that poor invalid good-by, as the lady
would immediately take a carriage to ride ten miles to her
residence in the country; her mother's heart yearning to
embrace her children, from whom she had been separated
for six months.</p>

<p>She kissed the child and told her she had been a good
little girl and had given her no trouble, but on the contrary,
had been a great comfort to her in many little ways,
and said if she was unhappy in her school or wanted any
aid, she must let her know it, and that in the summer (if
she were living, and she sighed) she should come out and
spend her vacation with her own little girls, Adelgunda
and Freya.</p>

<p>Zo&euml;, impelled out of her accustomed timidity and
reserve, flung her arms around her neck begging her, as
she did so, to take her with her.</p>

<p>"Not now, my child, you know your father's wish was
that you should be taken directly to Miss Ingemann's, and
it will be easier for you to be left among strangers now

<!--- vol 1 page 30 -->

than if you first went home with us. You will go cheerfully,
dear, will you not?"</p>

<p>She hesitated for a moment, then nodded her head by
way of assent, and ran to get Nanny.</p>

<p>That grave individual now had its beauty set off by the
addition to its wardrobe of an old sack of her own, the
sleeves projecting each side like budding wings. She had
insisted that she must suffer from the cold, as they came
into higher latitudes, and in this she was probably right,
as the Santa Cruzian goats have scarcely a sufficient modicum
of hair, it would seem, for home use much less for
colder regions. Nature is not negligent in adapting her
children's supplies to their needs, yet she has for so many
ages accustomed herself to do her work in her own quiet,
moderate way, that she is hardly up to our fast times, when
steam transports us from the extreme heat of one climate to
the no less extreme cold of another before she has time to
get her manufacturing apparatus in order to suit the conflicting
demands upon her.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; was leading Nanny across the deck when she met
Rolf, one of the ship's apprentices, a lad of seventeen,
who, as boys are very apt to do, expressed the interest
which he really felt in her by teazing her on every possible
occasion. He found an especial charm in this entertainment,
as Zo&euml; was inclined to take very literally all his jokes
and absurdities.</p>

<p>She was, moreover, rather irritable, and when thus
fretted, would disown all friendship with him, then and
forevermore, at least two or three times a day only to
return soon to be better friends than ever.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with your goat, Zo&euml;?"
said he.</p>

<p>"I am going to take her to Miss Ingemann's with me,"
said the child.</p>

<p>"Going to school is she? hey! I doubt if with all the

<!--- vol 1 page 31 -->

old lady's teaching she gets her beyond ba-a-a-a!" imitating
her bleating to perfection.</p>

<p>"She is not going to school," said she indignantly;
"she is going to play with me and give me milk."</p>

<p>"There is no room for goats up there, you silly child,
unless you can make a crib for her in your bandbox,"
said Rolf.</p>

<p>She was going to retort again, but for the first time it
flashed into her mind that he might be right, and that she
should have to give her up. She looked anxiously at him
and said:</p>

<p>"What must I do with her, then?"</p>

<p>"O! throw her overboard; let her go to Loke's (the
devil's) kingdom. She is one of his people anyway, you
know."</p>

<p>"You naughty, wicked boy!" said Zo&euml;, stamping her
foot. "It is no such thing. She is a <i>great deal</i> better
than you are;" and with that she quickened her pace to
reach the captain, whom she saw in advance of her. She
asked him, with a very downcast look, if she should have
to leave Nanny behind with that ugly <i>old</i> Rolf, who would
throw her into the sea to live with Loke.

<p>"O no! my little girl," said the kind-hearted captain,
"she shall have no such dreadful fate as that. How
should you like to have me carry her to my country place,
where my little girls will take good care of her, until you
come in the summer to visit them?"</p>

<p>Zo&euml; was delighted, and on those terms was reconciled
to parting with her pet, with whom, however, she took
most sentimental leave, murmuring over her every imaginable
term of endearment and promise of everlasting remembrance;
and then went back to triumph over Rolf for
Nanny's happy fortune. He soon found means to appease
her wrath, and, although two or three times in as many
minutes, he nearly provoked it again by his quips and
cranks at her expense; yet, at the last, they exchanged

<!--- vol 1 page 32 -->

keepsakes, and wished that they could both go back to
Santa Cruz together.</p>

<p>Over Carl's rough shoulders she threw the ribbon with
which she had adorned Nanny in her gala hours, and told
him to wear it when he went to Valhalla; and if he were
ever so old and gray she should know him by that, and she
would come and sit by him to listen to his stories. Good
Carl!</p>

<p>THE boarding-school into which Zo&euml; was now admitted,
was kept by a lady who had gained great reputation as a
teacher of young girls. She was of noble descent, but
inheriting from her parents more of rank than of wealth,
and scorning dependence, she had resorted to education
as a means of support, and had gained an honorable reputation
thereby. Tall and stately in her mien, with the
clear blue eyes, blonde hair, and light complexion of her
country-women, with decision, high thought and power of
command in every lineament of her face, and movement
of her figure, Miss Ingemann might have been taken for a
Volkyria, and, indeed, her pupils could not have held in
higher veneration her character and acquirements had she

<!--- vol 1 page 34 -->

shown them, in legible handwriting, her certificate from
Odin, that she had been of his court.</p>

<p>She received the little girl kindly and listened attentively
to all the directions which Mr. Carlan had intrusted
to the captain, as well as to his own fatherly injunction that
she should have careful attention, and after his departure,
seeing her look tearful and forlorn, she directed an assistant
to take her to her room, to the companion who was to
share it with her.</p>

<p>This was Hildegund, or Hilda Strophel, as she was
called, the daughter of a Danish gentleman, who two
years before possessed a large plantation in Santa Cruz.</p>

<p>He married a Creole lady of English descent, and for a
time lived in great state and splendor in the island. His
lands were very productive&mdash;sugar, the principal article
of export, brought him large profits, and he spent his immense
income in the rude magnificence, once so common
among the planters&mdash;in dinners, wines, horses, equipage,
rich plate, and last, but not least, in gambling. His house,
large, airy, and commodious, was open to his friends,
scores of whom he would welcome to his hospitality for
days and weeks together, at which time his halls would
echo to the sounds of music and revelry, until the night
waned into early dawn. But this was not sufficient for his
ambitious and pleasure-seeking wife. She was beautiful
and proud, and would fain be presented at court. She,
therefore, sought and easily gained her husband's consent
to spend a year at Denmark. Here the gayeties and excitement
of high life completely engrossed her, and when the
time appointed for their return arrived, she urged delay.
The idea of going back to little, contracted, quiet Santa
Cruz and its limited range of social life, was dreadful to
her. She pleaded one reason, and then another, to induce
her husband to remain. First, her health needed the
bracing air of the north, and afterwards the children must
be educated; and how could she leave the darlings among

<!--- vol 1 page 35 -->

strangers? although no scruples of that kind prevented
her banishing them to the mercy and to the exclusive care
of servants for days and weeks together. In vain did her
husband insist that his affairs required his oversight, and
that he should be a ruined man, if they pursued their present
course much longer: she could not be made to believe
it, and so long as the money for her expenditure was forthcoming,
she drove care to the winds. Her stronger will
and greater force of character overruled his prudence and
apprehensions of evil, and so they swept on in their wild
career. This false and reckless state of things could not,
of course, last forever. His manager was a crafty and
rapacious man, who had an eye only to his own interests.
He bribed the attorney left in charge of Mr. Strophel's
business, to further his plans; so while they sent fair
accounts of the great profits the estate was yielding, and
money enough to blind him to the true state of things, they
were exhausting the land, wearing out the negroes by
cruel usage and lack of care, and in fine, feathering their
own nests with the riches of the poor, simple bird who
had given himself up as their prey. So one fine winter's
eve, when my lady was all appareled to wait upon her
Majesty, news came that he was bankrupt. What to do
now was the question? Return they must, to gather up
the fragments of his once splendid fortune, but how were
they to live? It happened that he had influential friends
at court, through whose efforts he obtained a lucrative
office, just left vacant in the island, and in a week they
were on their way to Santa Cruz, with many a bitter regret
on the part of Mrs. Strophel, that her gay and brilliant
life was comparatively at an end.</p>

<p>The little Hilda had just entered her sixth year, and
her they left with Miss Ingemann, until her school education
should be completed. She was a bright, gay little
sprite, and her rosy, dimpled face and laughing blue eye
reflected every emotion of her changeful spirits, so that

<!--- vol 1 page 36 -->

Miss Ingemann, when particularly gracious and condescending,
would designate her as Mademoiselle Aprilis.</p>

<p>When Zo&euml; entered the room, she was giving her doll,
nearly as large as herself, a lesson in waltzing, scolding
her in the tone and phrase caught from her dancing-master,
for her imperfect attention: "Toe out, toe out. Doesn't
she mean to take the steps right? Does she wish to go
into the black-hole?"</p>

<p>At her first glance at Zo&euml;, she stopped short, and stood
in speechless amazement. She was but two when she left
her birthplace, and had no recollection of the blacks or
colored people, her nurse dying soon after her arrival, and
although they were occasionally seen in Copenhagen, she
had never happened to meet one. Zo&euml; was no darker than
many a <i>white</i> Creole, and she was entirely free from the
most peculiar and repulsive African indications; but there
was a marked difference between her countenance and
that of the other girls, which struck and interested Hilda,
and although thrown off her guard by surprise, she felt
that, compared with the rather common-place and inexpressive
features of many of them, the little stranger certainly
had the advantage.</p>

<p>Zo&euml;'s heavy eyelids lifted, and her face brightened, as
she looked at the human sunbeam before her, and after
gazing straight into each other's faces for a full minute,
much to the amusement of Miss Holberg, they exchanged
smiles, an omen of their future friendship, and then Hilda
ran off to find some of her schoolmates.</p>

<p>"O! if we haven't got the funniest, little dark elves
now," said she, as she danced into the general sitting-room
of the pupils, where a dozen or more were collected;
"the new scholar, whom Miss Holberg told us was to
come from away off in the West Indies. Her hair is as
black as jet, and all wavy; her skin is dreadfully tanned
and her eyes are so mournful. I wonder if she is not one
of the little Hillfolk, who never expect to go to Heaven.

<!--- vol 1 page 37 -->

But she has a beautiful sweet smile. I know I shall like
her; I feel already that we shall soon say <i>thou</i> to each
other; I am so glad she is going to room with me."</p>

<p>"O yes, Mademoiselle Aprilis, and how long will it be
before you quarrel, as you did with Rinda, and have to be
separated?" said Elize; "I should advise you to be a little
less hasty in getting up your romantic friendships."</p>

<p>"Well, I cannot help it, if Rinda will fly off the handle
like an old jackknife that is loose in the rivets, at every
word that is spoken to her. I am ready to love her again,
when she is not so cross and fretful."</p>

<p>"Who would not get out of patience with you, you little
bumble-bee, buzzing about one's face and ears all the
time, and such an everlasting talker too? She said she
could not study, nor read, nor sew, nor do anything, you
tormented her so."</p>

<p>The idea of being a bumble-bee struck Hilda as so
comical, that she laughed loud and long, and forthwith
began to act in the character of that demonstrative insect,
flying about the room with her arms extended, with a buzz
equal to that of twenty of her tribe, giving this girl's cheek
a tap, and that one's nose a pull, and pinching a third by
way of a sting, and poking her fingers through still another's
hair, until there was a general uproar and indignation
meeting, when fortunately the door opened for some
one to enter, and she whizzed past in a bee-line towards
her own room, to see the new comer.</p>

<p>She found Miss Holberg engaged in unpacking and
arranging Zo&euml;'s clothes, while giving an occasional direction
to her about keeping them in order, she, in the
meantime, sitting passive and silent on a stool, watching
her and nodding assent from time to time to her suggestions.</p>

<p>"And Zo&euml;," she said, as Hilda bounced in, "you will
keep your closet and drawers very neat, dear, for it is a
very good habit to grow up with, and besides, with so

<!--- vol 1 page 38 -->

many little girls to see to, it would give us great trouble if
you did not."</p>

<p>"Zo&euml;! is that her name?" said Hilda to herself, "what
did her mother call her so for? It is not half as pretty as
Gunhilda or Thora."</p>

<p>Here was a sphere for my little ladyship. She was
a real Anglo-Saxon in character and mind, as well as in
descent; energetic, expressive in action as well as in word;
inventive, decided and managing. She was soon deep in
the business of the hour, loading herself with Zo&euml;'s frocks,
until she looked like a moving mass of drapery, when her
laughing face and voice would peep out and resound from
between the folds; or, finding odd corners and shelves for
shoes and the various knick-knacks of femininehood; or
passing judgment upon the child's wardrobe; or laying
down the law to Miss Holberg herself, bustling about
and talking all the time, and altogether as busy as "a
hen with one chick."</p>

<p>"O, I like this! I wish there were clothes to unpack
and put away all the time; it is a great deal better than to
sit still and study or sew; and is not this little nook a good
place for the parasol? it is so nicely out of the way. But
what are these gauzy things? I guess her mother thought
it was as hot out here as in Santa Cruz. I may as well
fold them up and put them in the very bottom of her trunk,
for she will never use them till she goes back. And, Miss
Holberg, don't you put those stockings there, for it is my
own especial corner, and I can't spare it; here is a place&mdash;lay
them there, please."</p>

<p>Every now and then, too, she would look over to Zo&euml;
and smile upon her in a very protecting way, and when she
came near her in her revolutions around the room, she
would give her a hug; but though its spirit evidently
pleased the child, she winced under the act.</p>

<p>At length all was neatly arranged, the last package
paper picked up and put away for incendiary use, and

<!--- vol 1 page 39 -->

the trunk moved into the most out-of-the-way corner; and
what more could Hilda do to show her good-will to the
stranger? She thought of a box of sugar-plums, which
she had treasured up for her next feast, when Freja and
Adelgunda came in with their dolls to play visiting with
her. She ran and opened it and poured out the larger
half and held them out to Zo&euml;, saying:</p>

<p>"Here, you may have them."</p>

<p>"No, I thank you," said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"O, but you may! I have got a plenty besides. I don't
wish for them at all."</p>

<p>"Neither do I, thank you, I don't care for sugar-plums."</p>

<p>"But you shall have them, I had rather you would than
not," and suiting the action to the word, she put her hand
up to press them into her mouth.</p>

<p>Miss Holberg, who through all these scenes had had her
eye upon the children and was forming her own opinion
upon them, now spoke out:</p>

<p>"Hilda, my child, what are you doing? Come directly
to me."</p>

<p>She stood before her.</p>

<p>"Look straight into my eyes and listen to what I say."</p>

<p>She obeyed.</p>

<p>"You know, Hilda, that I have told you before, that you
are too managing&mdash;too commanding in your disposition. I
see plainly that if you do not put a check upon yourself,
you will ride directly over this passive, gentle little being
with your rough, abrupt ways. Do you not see that she is
different from you? (a very decided nod of assent from
Hilda). Then do not force her to like just what you do.
Let her work and enjoy herself in her own way. You do
not wish to be a <i>tyrant</i> do you? (laying a contemptuous
emphasis upon the word) and make Zo&euml; miserable and
cause her to dislike and fear you?"</p>

<p>Hilda had a noble, generous, candid nature, and when a
truth was plainly presented to her, never flinched from its

<!--- vol 1 page 40 -->

avowal, even though it told against herself. She looked
very serious, and said:</p>

<p>"No, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Will you remember what I have said?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>This timely rebuke, earnestly uttered, ever after acted
as a restraint upon Hilda, and as a defense for Zo&euml;; for,
excepting in occasional fits of exuberant spirits, when the
former, like a whirlwind, would sweep clear away all
obstacles to her dominion, making one grand hurly-burly,
the latter, bending low until the blast went by; it required
her only to say, "Hilda, dear, you remember what Miss
Holberg said? Let me enjoy myself my own way," and
she would pretty soon desist from her attempt to rule.</p>

<p>It would be well for Anglo-Saxondom throughout the
world, if some wise school-marm could thus put an extinguisher
upon her propensity to force her government,
creeds, customs and tastes upon nations and people who
do not like them, or who are not yet prepared for them.</p>

<p>The two little girls were now left alone.</p>

<p>"Do you think you shall like here?" said Hilda, whose
tongue was seldom still.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Zo&euml;. "Everything is so strange,
and it seems so close," looking around at the shut doors
and glazed windows.</p>

<p>"Close! why, are you too warm?" said she, opening the
door. "I thought you came from a country where there
was no winter and that we never should be able to keep a
fire large enough for you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is very warm, but the doors are always open,
and we have no glass in the windows, and there is a
breeze all the time; it seems as if I could not breathe
here, all shut up," and she drew a long breath as she
walked towards the window.</p>

<p>"What strange trees! Ours have beautiful, shining
green leaves on them, and flowers, too," said she.</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 41 -->

<p>"So have ours in the summer. As soon as the warm
days in spring come back, they burst out in no time, and
it is just like walking from one world into another&mdash;the
change is so great and quick."</p>

<p>"O, that must be beautiful!" said Zo&euml;, brightening up.</p>

<p>"Yes," Hilda went on, elated that she could make her
look more cheerful; "and then we have such splendid
times! Miss Ingemann takes us into the country, and we
climb the hills and ford the brooks, and see the peasant
women make their butter and cheese, and play with the
calves, and eat our dinner out of doors, and, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you ever see the little elves that Carl told me
about on board ship, and the Hillpeople, and hear their
sweet music?"

<p>"No&mdash;o," said Hilda, disappointed that she could not go
on in her triumphal march, "but I think I shall next summer,
I shall look for them. They are very little, you know,
and I don't care very much about them, I like to gather
strawberries better."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; turned to the window again. "Where does all this
cotton come from?" said she, looking up at the large snowflakes,
which were falling thick and fast.</p>

<p>"Cotton!" said Hilda, clapping her hands&mdash;"good,
good! Why it is snow, ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"What is snow?"</p>

<p>"Why, it is rain that freezes away up in the sky and
comes down in this way."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; looked up disconsolate, and thought, that if the
rain froze so up near the sun, what should she do down on
the cold bare earth; and she shivered, and sat down on the
stool by the fire, shrugging up her shoulders, and leaning
her hands on her knees, and looking quite the picture of
desolation, while Hilda danced the Schottische around the
room.</p>

<p>"Come, let's dance and play a bit," said she, holding
out her hands to her.</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 42 -->

<p>Zo&euml; hesitated.</p>

<p>"I won't plague you; I'll remember what Miss Holberg
said."</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of that," said Zo&euml;; "but mamma
told me to write to her when I got to Copenhagen, and I
ought to do that first, for the captain said, that a ship
would go back soon."</p>

<p>"So I would," said Hilda, "and I'll help;" but the
image of Miss Holberg coming up, she said, "should you
not like to have me draw up this small table for you near
the fire?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Zo&euml;, and went to get her little
writing-desk, which her father had given her and furnished
with all needful materials.</p>

<p>"You are little to know how to write," said Hilda, as
Zo&euml; spread her paper and took her pen.</p>

<p>"I can't write like men and women, but I can print a
little, and mamma said she could puzzle it out, if it was
not written well, for she loved me so much;" and she
brushed away a tear and began:</p>

<p>"DEAR MAMMA:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am going to write you a letter."</p>

<p>"O, don't crowd your words so," said Hilda; "if you
do, your mother will never be able to read them in the
world&mdash;I mean, I would not if I were you," she added in a
very deprecating way.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; began again, and this time the letters were separated
twice as far as they needed to be. Hilda was about to
exclaim against this mode, but recollecting Miss Holberg's
injunction, she pinched her fingers hard and bit her lips,
and thinking she should be more out of temptation to do
something besides watching her neighbor, she seized a
book, and seated herself by the fire, and was soon absorbed
in Hans Christian Andersen's story of the Ugly Duck,
which he had given her the day before.</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 43 -->

<div class="center">

<p class="small">ZO&Euml;'S LETTER.</p>

</div>

<p>"MY DEAR MAMMA:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am going to write you a letter. Do you miss me
any? I had a good voyage, and Carl told me a great many
funny stories. Does papa miss me any? Nanny is gone
into the country to live at the captain's house with his two
little girls. I like Miss Holberg&mdash;that is one of the
teachers; she is very kind to me. I shall go and see
Nanny in the summer; the captain said so. There is a very
merry little girl in the room with me; her name is Hilda;
I think she tries not to manage me, as Miss Holberg called
it. She told me about the leaves coming all out on the
trees in the spring. It is very cold here, and the air has a
great many snows in it; that is, rain frozen up in the sky
and coming down like feathers.</p>

<p>"FROM YOUR OWN ZO&Euml;.</p>

<p>"Ever so much love to papa and you."</p>

<p>Seeing Zo&euml; closing her desk, Hilda got up and went to
her.</p>

<p>"What a pretty little desk you have got! I wish I had
one like it."</p>

<p>"You may use mine whenever you want to," said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"You are a dear, good little girl," said Hilda, "and I
know I shall like you. We will say <i>thou</i> to each other,
will we not?"</p>

<p>"What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"O, when people love very much, they say <i>thou</i>, when
they speak to each other, instead of <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>Here Zo&euml;'s timidity and self-distrust came up, and she
said, "I am afraid you will not like me so well as you
think you will, and if you left off saying it, I should feel
so bad; I had rather wait a little."</p>

<p>"What an odd little thing," thought Hilda; "sure
enough, she is different from me. I think as Miss Holberg

<!--- vol 1 page 44 -->

said, I may as well let her do things her own way, and we
will see what comes next."</p>

<p>Hilda's curiosity coming into play was a great saving to
her fingers and lips, for she never afterwards had to bite
or pinch them so hard in order to keep them in their
proper places.</p>

</div>

<p>ZO&Euml; soon became tolerably wonted to her new home.
Shrinking and timid as she was, her first introduction
into a school of forty girls was painful and awkward.
Some stared and nudged their next neighbors to look at
her; some smiled upon her as if to re-assure her; some
said and did their prettiest things to draw forth her admiration;
while the older ones either were, or affected to be
too much absorbed in, their occupations to observe her
at all.</p>

<p>Hilda would very gladly have shown her off in school-room,
parlor, and kitchen, had it not been for Miss

<!--- vol 1 page 46 -->

Holberg&mdash;either visible as she busied herself with the
pupils, or invisible in the shape of her earnest rebuke,
seconded by the shy manners of Zo&euml; herself, which pleaded
to be left in quietness and obscurity. Her childish lessons
were easily learned, and she obtained her share of the
little prizes awarded by Miss Ingemann to the best scholar
in the different studies. In no way did she seem very unlike
the other children either in study or play or in the
little household occupations which her teacher, true northern
woman as she was, required each in their turn to
share; only that she seemed of a more indolent temperament
than the Danish girls. This prompted her to retire
from their active sports sooner than the others, and disinclined
her to long and steady occupation; in fact, as was
the plain speech of the school, she was rather "lazy."</p>

<p>"Come," Hilda would say to her, "put on your furs and
hood and let's go skating. See how bright the sun shines
and what good sport the girls have! Ha! ha! there goes
one down and another on the top of her! But what is
that?"</p>

<p>"It is Rinda," said Zo&euml;; "she said she was going to be
the Snow Queen, that Mr. Andersen told us about. You
see she has dug her a palace in that great drift&mdash;look at
the icicles which she has hung from her curls, and she has
got a snow-baby in her arms! U-g-h! It makes me shiver
to see her," and she left the window and crouched down
by the fire.</p>

<p>Hilda screamed with delight as she saw the Queen, with
the light snow stuck to her lips and a long icicle for a
scepter in her hand, run round to kiss her subjects, who
shrunk from her cold embrace and chilly sway.</p>

<p>"Come, come, there's rare fun there. I'll be the reindeer
and upset her throne with my branching horns, and
you, with your black eyes and dark skin, may be the little
robber-maiden with the warm muff to warm our hands for
us. That will suit you, won't it?"</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 47 -->

<p>"Y-e-s," said Zo&euml;, and not liking to disappoint her play-mates,
she suffered herself to be dragged out to the Snow
Queen's palace, from which, however, she soon stole away
half-frozen to build one in her own way, of feathery tamarind
boughs and waving palm leaves, with a tropical sun
glistening through the shining leaves, and the blue and
violet sea stretched out before her, while loving faces and
gentle words filled up the scene and made its fitting music.</p>

<p>"I wonder," said she to herself, "if our Father in
Heaven, who mamma says, is our best friend and knows
what is good for us, told my papa to send me away off to
this cold country, where everything is so strange to me.
There is the sun; it shines bright enough, but it does
not warm me much, and how naked the world looks here!
Hilda says, that it is prettier in the summer, and she tells
me the truth about things, I know, so I believe her. I
am sure I shall be glad to walk into the new summer-world,
when it comes. Doesn't God love the white people
as well as he does us, that he gives them snow and ice and
such cold weather? But what a good warm fire this is!
How it crackles and blazes! I must move my seat back,
for it is too warm. O, now I know, God gives them plenty
of wood, so as to make a sun for themselves when his grows
cold. Isn't he kind to think of it? and Hilda likes snow
and says she has the best fun in winter. So I suppose, it is
all right; I must take my furs off too. How soft they are!
O yes! and God gives <i>them</i> too, as well as the great wood-fires&mdash;I
mean the animals they grow on. Yes, they seem
well taken care of; but I can't help wondering whether he
meant that I should come; but I've got to stay here now,
so I may as well be contented," and she drew a long sigh.</p>

<p>"Have you got your lesson in geography?" said Hilda, as
Zo&euml; sat listless, one morning, with her books in her lap.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Zo&euml;, "I've learned the words, but I don't
understand nor care about parallels of latitude and longitude,
and exactly the spot where people live. If I only

<!--- vol 1 page 48 -->

like them, and they have a pleasant country for a home,
why then I'm very glad."</p>

<p>"But don't you wish to know whether they are north or
south of you, or which way the points of compass are?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't. I like to learn, whether they live in a
warm or cold country, and what they have to eat and drink,
and what kind of people they are, and such as that; but I
don't understand why it is that Miss Ingemann said she
could not be contented in a place till she knew just where
the east was. If the sun will only rise warm and burst
the little buds which Miss Holberg showed me were
wrapped up so nicely, and the pretty flowers will bloom,
and I can feel as if I could walk about without shrugging
up my shoulders so because I am so chilled; it is all of the
points of the compass I care about."</p>

<p>"What a droll little thing you are," said Hilda. "But
we must learn about these things if we don't like them.
Miss Ingemann says that all little girls ought to. Come,
it is school time and she has gone in;" and hand in hand
these children, so opposite, and yet already so assimilated
as to be chosen companions to each other, entered her
presence.</p>

<p>This lady, in many respects, was admirably adapted to
her part as a trainer of young minds. In the first place,
her character was high-toned and truthful, in an eminent
degree. Nothing mean, unjust, or indelicate could stand
the test of her clear eye, or indignant protest. She was
not merely ordinarily truthful in speech, but in thought, in
manner, in her judgment of people and passing events,
did she strive after and attain to a wonderful degree of
integrity. As the crown of her high qualities she was sincerely
religious. Her faith was not worn externally as a
holiday garb; as it were, but entered into the warp and
woof of her being, and was the secret spring which regulated
her intellect, her affections, and her life. Common-sensible
and earnest, she sought to fit her pupils for the

<!--- vol 1 page 49 -->

duties and enjoyments of the world they lived in, by developing
their powers in just proportion, rather than by
encouraging any idiosyncrasy of mind or character. Her
mode of culture and personal influence was happy and
beautiful upon most of the minds in her charge. Under
her genial and affectionate care Hilda had budded and was
blooming like a rose. They were greatly alike naturally,
courageous, high-spirited, with minds in which the understanding
predominated, direct in speech and decisive in
action. Clear in her reasoning, exact in her knowledge
and conscientious in her investigations after the truth; with
her imagination under due restraint, the mind of Miss
Ingemann was like a grand and spacious storehouse, free
from whatever was unseemly, with various generous-sized
parcels, all neatly arranged and ready for instant use,
while a clear, steady light pervaded the scene. So that
though one might at first ask, what more could be wished
for in an educator of youth? the answer might be&mdash;scarcely
anything in intention, yet time must test her ability to deal
with a nature so opposite in its tendencies to her own as
that of the little Anglo-African.</p>

<p>MONTGOMERY.</p>

</div>

<p>"JOY, joy," said Hilda, bursting into their common
room one morning, "it is holiday you know, to-day, and
Mrs. K&ouml;rner has sent to know if you and I may go to her
house this afternoon and play with her little boys. O, I
like her so much, and Mr. K&ouml;rner is the best and the funniest
man that ever was. All the children call him <i>the kind
gentleman</i>. Aren't you glad?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Zo&euml;, to whom the idea of some change was
grateful; "but I am afraid to go to see strangers."</p>

<p>"O, you need not be. They won't be strangers to you
five minutes. Everybody is at home at Mrs. K&ouml;rner's&mdash;Miss
Holberg says so."</p>

<p>Accordingly they were neatly arrayed, and after a short
walk, were admitted into a plain, but cheerful-looking
mansion, and conducted up-stairs to the nursery&mdash;a good-sized
room, comfortably furnished, and ornamented with
engravings such as would interest children, with here and
there marks upon the tables, sofas, and chairs, made by
the collision of toy carriages and horses, and the various
implements of a children's play-shop.</p>

<p>They were greeted kindly by a bright, handsome, happy-looking
woman, with Carl, the youngest hope in her arms,

<!--- vol 1 page 51 -->

by Frederick, a black-eyed boy, of Hilda's age, and Emile,
a little stammerer of three.</p>

<p>"Come, Hilda, let's play at draughts," said Fred, in the
summary way in which youngsters go into subjects, leaving
complimentary greetings very much to their elders. "You
may have the white men and I will have the black, and we
will play the giving-away game."</p>

<p>"Well," said she; "and what shall Zo&euml; do?" who was
standing timidly by.</p>

<p>"Please give me my playthings, mamma," said Emile,
in a mode of speech guiltless of many letters, especially
consonants, familiarly known as baby-talk.</p>

<p>"O, yes," said Mrs. K&ouml;rner, "and this little girl may
help you set up your town and build castles with the
blocks. Will you, dear?"</p>

<p>Zo&euml; liked nothing better than this amusement, which
gave scope to her fancy; and she and the gentle but merry
little Emile were soon good friends.</p>

<p>"Make me a castle as big as that, please," said he,
stretching out his arms to their full width.</p>

<p>"I don't know how; but I will try to make my papa's
house that is away over the great sea," said she, at
which promise he was pleased, watching her progress and
handing her the blocks as she built it upon pillars, connected
by arches, with a veranda all around and steps to
ascend it.</p>

<p>"Build it higher," said he, as he saw her putting the
roof over the single story.</p>

<p>"I must not," said she; "the hurricane, that's a high
wind that comes sometimes, will blow it over."</p>

<p>"You must put a chimney to it," said Fred, whose
attention was drawn away from his game by their talk.</p>

<p>"No," said Zo&euml;, "we don't have chimneys."</p>

<p>"How can you cook your dinners?" said Fred, who
was fond of creature comforts. "Don't you eat anything
but oranges and pine-apples?"</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 52 -->

<p>"Yes," said she, "but the kitchen is a little house outside."</p>

<p>"That's queer; how should you like, mother, to have to
go out-doors to another house to make your puddings and
tarts for dessert?"</p>

<p>"Very well," said Mrs. K&ouml;rner, "if I lived in a warm
country, because it would keep the heat from the house."</p>

<p>At this Hilda, who had become impatient at the interruption
of the game, said, "Come, it is your turn to move."</p>

<p>Fred was moderate in his movements, and remained
with his eyes still fixed upon the house-building, whereupon
Hilda gave the board a push against him to attract
his attention, but with such force, that he burst out crying,
and said, he would play no more.</p>

<p>Hilda, partly provoked and partly sorry, tried to make
the matter fair to Mrs. K&ouml;rner, by saying, "she did not
mean to hurt him."</p>

<p>"Stop, stop crying, Fred," said Mrs. K&ouml;rner, and then
added, with a brightening manner, "Who wants to go into
the yard, and see my little white rabbits?"</p>

<p>There was a general rush for the door, Fred's last tear
being hastily dashed away, and Zo&euml; even following with
alacrity, to see the household pets.</p>

<p>After due admiration of the timid, long-eared, pink-eyed
specimens of living natural history, and seeing them in
repose, eating, jumping, in every attitude possible to rabbit
capacity, Mrs. K&ouml;rner, Zo&euml;, and Emile returned to the
house, leaving Hilda and Fred to romp in the yard for a
while.</p>

<p>But the spirit of management which slept in Hilda,
under Miss Holberg's eye and was kept in abeyance with
the gentle, non-resistant Zo&euml;, became rampant, with the
vigorous, strong-willed, self-indulgent boy Fred, and when
he tried to force her to play in his way, she only pulled
him the harder towards the fulfillment of her plans, until
he, quite out of patience at her presuming to have a decided

<!--- vol 1 page 53 -->

preference of her own, and not only that, but insisting
upon it that her will should be his, gave her frock a
twitch, making a bad rent in it.</p>

<p>Hilda's bottle of tears was very near her eyes, and if
anything went wrong, out came the cork, and to one more
self-restrained, there seemed a great waste of feeling;
but this time, she was sure there was sufficient cause, not
only for crying, but for chastisement of the wicked Fred,
so she inflicted a hearty slap upon that young gentleman's
shoulder. He was never above weeping and lamentation
when occasion offered, so that there was presented to Mrs.
K&ouml;rner, the next moment, the spectacle of two mutually injured
and enraged young <i>humans</i>, with flashing eyes and
burning cheeks, and four great rivers running down from
as many eyes.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" said that lady, with the manner
of one ready to listen to complaints, and award due justice,
and by no means thrown off her balance, as if it were the
first belligerent case upon her docket, and she were to give
her maiden charge.</p>

<p>"He pulled me first," said Hilda.</p>

<p>"She struck me, and real hard too," sobbed the little
lord of creation.</p>

<p>"My little Hilda," said Mrs. K&ouml;rner, "you know I have
three rough, strong boys who have no little sister to make
them gentle, and I want you and Zo&euml; to help me to do so,
will you not?"</p>

<p>Hilda paused a moment, as if a new idea had dawned
upon her, but her wrongs came up again, and she cried,
"He pulled me first!"</p>

<p>"She had no business to strike me," murmured Fred.</p>

<p>"Go into the bath-room and wash your tears away, and
you will feel better," said his mother; "your papa will be
at home soon, and I want him to see happy faces."</p>

<p>This was the "expulsive power of a new affection" to
them, and with the cold water it banished every trace of

<!--- vol 1 page 54 -->

ill-temper, so that five minutes after, they were playing as
if their life's sea had never been ruffled.</p>

<p>The door-bell rang, and the shout went up, "There's
papa;" and a glad "Hurra," was heard from a manly voice
in the hall, and quick steps upon the stairs soon brought a
brave beaming face to their view.</p>

<p>The baby clapped hands; Fred climbed up his father's
perpendicular with a little help, till he crowed from his
seat on his shoulder. Emile looked at Fred, and tried to
do and say just what he did. Hilda jumped up and down
and pulled him at every point by turns, while the little Carl
looked and stretched out his arms towards him, his straining
eye, eager even to painfulness, pleading for notice,
as if here was his "kingdom come," and he must rush
into it.</p>

<p>"How are you, my dear?" said he, shaking hands with
his wife. Zo&euml; sat smiling placidly upon this noisy greeting,
and hoped the kind gentleman would speak to her
by-and-by.</p>

<p>"And who is this?" said he, disrobing himself gently of
the children and stooping towards her.</p>

<p>"It's Zo&euml;," said Fred, "and see, she has built a house,
such as they have in Santa Cruz where she lives."</p>

<p>"How do you do, my little dear?" said he, putting on
his spectacles, for he was near-sighted; "and how do you
like Copenhagen?"

<p>"I like some things very well; but it is cold, and there
are no flowers, and I am afraid I shan't get all my lessons
well to say to Miss Ingemann."</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, "but it will be warm soon, and then we
will take you to ride in the country, and Fred shall hold
the reins and Emile the whip, and we will cover you all
over with flowers; won't we, Carl?" said he, tossing him
up and down and handing him to his mother: "and as for
the lesson, you must say to it&mdash;you old hard lesson, do
you jump right into my head and there do you stick, and

<!--- vol 1 page 55 -->

if you ever get out, I'll, I'll <i>pound</i> you in," and he squared
at an open book on the table near, and brought down his
clenched fist hard upon it.</p>

<p>The children gazed admiringly at his valor, and all
laughed at his threatened assault, when the tea-bell rang
and Mrs. K&ouml;rner directed Fred to lead Hilda, and Emile
Zo&euml;; while she followed, arm-in-arm with her husband, to
the dining-room below stairs.</p>

<p>The next morning Zo&euml; was awakened by the entrance
of Hilda into the room attired in cloak and hood, as if returning
from a walk.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" said she.</p>

<p>"To Mr. K&ouml;rner's, to carry back the dice of the backgammon
board, which I found in my pocket. I was afraid
Mrs. K&ouml;rner would hunt for them, as she did once before
after we had played. Did we not have a good visit?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Zo&euml;; "I like them all, and I do not feel
one bit afraid of them; they are so kind and Emile is a
little darling."</p>

<p>"I like to frolic with Mr. K&ouml;rner," said Hilda, "he lets
me do anything to him I want to."</p>

<p>"But I think he had rather you would be gentle though
he is so lively; for he looked tired when he sat down, as
if he had worked hard all day."</p>

<p>"I <i>did</i> hear him say to Mrs. K&ouml;rner softly when I was
pulling him hardest: 'What a little catamount she is!' "
said Hilda, "but he was in fun, I guess; for don't you
think, when I went there this morning, I ran directly to the
breakfast-room where they were at the table, and as soon as
he saw me he took up the newspaper and read:</p>

<p class="small">" 'Found fighting in Mr. K&ouml;rner's yard by the police, Frederick K&ouml;rner
and Hilda Strophel. They were taken to the watch-house and kept
during the night, and this morning carried to Court; where their mortified
parents and teacher plead for their release, which, after paying
five dollars and costs, was granted them.'</p>

<p>"I was so frightened that I snatched the paper out of his

<!--- vol 1 page 56 -->

hand to read it myself, and there was not a word of it
there. O! I never know when Mr. K&ouml;rner is serious or
when he makes-believe&mdash;he is so droll.</p>

<p>"But do get up, Zo&euml;, how lazy you are! The breakfast-bell
will ring in ten minutes, and I am afraid Miss Ingemann
will scold you if you are not ready."</p>

<p>MISS INGEMANN had a few clear and true principles
by which to judge of human nature and character.
She was fond of its study and proud of her shrewdness in its
interpretation, and seemed to consider it a legitimate gymnasium
in which to exercise and sharpen her intellect.
Her skill and knowledge stood her in good stead with most
of her pupils. Such a development in one of them went
for so much and must be encouraged or repressed, as the
case might be. Such an expression indicated this or that
tendency and must be dealt with accordingly. With the
frank, open Danish girls, who could bear any amount of
direct scrutiny into their natures&mdash;for so much in harmony
was hers with their own that they appreciated her kindly
motive and dearly loved her&mdash;her plain, abrupt method
answered very well; but with Zo&euml; it was different. Her
first feeling when led into the stately presence of Miss
Ingemann, was admiration. Left for the first time without
some one familiar to her to lean upon, she longed for the
love of the beautiful white lady, whose blue eye shone so
brightly upon the little girls around her and who all
seemed to live in the light of her kindly smile. But when
she fixed her clear, intellectual gaze upon her as if to read
the soul within, that world where from infancy she had
been wont to retire and revel in silent delight, not without

<!--- vol 1 page 58 -->

misgivings of a failure in truth and duty in so doing, she
shrank timid and frightened within herself.</p>

<p>Like the tamarind leaf of her own clime, which closes
at the rude touch of one who would read its hidden mystery,
so when most yearning for sympathy and companionship
she involuntarily shrank from her teacher's direct manner
and intellectual attempt at her analysis, though she
knew she was disposed to be her kind friend. To Miss
Ingemann she was at first an enigma, but as days and weeks
went by, and she developed nothing remarkable, she set
her down as a gentle, well-disposed little girl, with but
little energy and less frankness; with no decided tastes of
any kind; wanting in earnestness of character, and governed
more by a love of approbation than by anything else. She
had no complaint to make of her; she performed her tasks
well, but the lack was too general a one for her to reach&mdash;a
moderate capacity and no real enthusiasm for anything.
It needed no words for Zo&euml; to read this sentence as she
advanced in years; every sense and nerve revealed it to
her and she assented to it all. And yet there was within
her the eternal questioning and unrest of a dissatisfied,
imprisoned soul. Her face, pensive and mild in its expression,
was a poor index to the want of harmony between her
inward and outward life, and it wore, in its almost unvarying
calmness, the natural defense of a reserved and keenly-sensitive
spirit, which would hide from every eye its
struggles and griefs.</p>

<p>As the two children grew apace, it was interesting to
note the broad contrast in their persons, manners, characters,
and minds, and, at the same time, the beautiful harmony
between them. Like the soprano and contralto in
music; like light and shade in a picture; like pathos and
humor in fiction; like tender sentiment and triumphant
expression in poetry; like joy and plaintive sadness in life,
did they blend and divide in its daily anthem, till one
became necessary to the full contentment of the other, and

<!--- vol 1 page 59 -->

there was evident on each the indirect influence of a companionship
salutary to both.</p>

<p>Hilda, the elder by a whole year, was the taller and
fuller in figure, with the clear red and white which the
keen breath and tempered ray of a northern wind and sun
paints, and not for a brief day only, upon the cheeks of her
fair ones; with blonde hair, so light and silky that the
faintest breeze would set it afloat, and with a blue eye that
would kindle and brighten, throwing a flood of light over
her whole face, like the sun rising from the ocean depths
and spreading his radiance over sky, earth, and water. Her
step was quick and elastic, and when suffered to act out
her impulses, her modes of locomotion were a bound and
a spring, dancing a few steps forward, turning around as
in a waltz, swaying back and forward &agrave; la schottische with
an ordinary step or two in advance, to be continued by a
movement of original composition. Her mind was as
active and as versatile in its operations as her body. At
one time she would be absorbed with her doll, dressing
and undressing it; washing or altering its wardrobe; teaching
it her own various exercises; telling it over and over
the rules of the school, with additions &agrave; la Hilda, and especially
enforcing them by occasional punishments, so that
the school-girls, who all had reaped the benefit of Miss
Holberg's rebuke for her spirit of management, had great
amusement in seeing how the safety-valve was let off in
the direction of poor dolly, who, as they suggestively
said, had "to take it," since they were somewhat relieved.
When once settled down to her studies, her acquisitions
were rapid and correct, provided she understood them perfectly;
but she took few things on trust, nor believed much
in any subtle, hidden meanings, but if everything seemed
clear and reasonable, she easily mastered it. In character
and feelings she was like an April day, as her nickname
denoted. For story-reading she had an insatiable appetite,
preferring the true, but swallowing fairy and goblin tales,

<!--- vol 1 page 60 -->

too, though with some wry faces, and much demurring at
their hard digestion. Strong-willed and decided, only to a
firm, wise mind and cheerful spirit would she submit, and
then only through much struggle with herself, which would
often vent itself in loud weeping and complaining at her
supposed wrongs; or, when desperate and under the eye of
one in whom she stood in awe, only in inarticulate ejaculations
to herself. But when most severely punished, and
subdued to quietness, her teacher would begin to relent
and question herself if she had not been too hard with her
and thus crushed the tender young spirit, who now, passive
and serious, was gazing apparently at vacancy, she
would start up and say: "O, look, Miss Ingemann, at that
funny old man formed by the coals in the fireplace! What
a great pack he has got on his back, and how be turns his
long nose up!" She would then, forgetting her dreadful injuries,
throw her arms around her neck, and exclaim upon
her beauty and her own love for her, overwhelming her with
kisses till she had to cry for quarter and beat a retreat to
her own apartment.</p>

<p>She was her teacher's pride and joy, as she developed
beautifully in mind and person, under her fostering care,
and she looked forward to a brilliant and happy future for
her favorite.</p>

<p>Miss Ingemann's birth, mind, manners, and character
being of such elevated stamp, she sustained a high position
in the society of Copenhagen. Her pupils were from
among its best and noblest citizens, and her companionship
was sought by the enlightened and titled of the land.
To Hans Christian Andersen, she had been a friend and
early patron, and to him her doors were ever open in hospitable
welcome. And from the children of her school he
always met a glad and noisy reception. Hilda would run
to him with outstretched arms and beg for a feast from his
"nice cupboard full of stories," and no fond mother was ever
more generous in giving food to her children, than he in

<!--- vol 1 page 61 -->

their distribution. Simple they were, yet full of poetic life;
quaint and humorous, yet shedding sensibility and sympathy
for the poor and struggling from every point; and
what gave them their deepest interest was not their genius
merely, for that was but the instrument by which he poured
forth to the people, each one of whom was a dear brother
or sister, the vailed experience of a tried, but disciplined,
true and devoted life. He would sing to them too, most
sweetly, and Zo&euml; loved him better even for his music than
for his tales. His dramatic power was at their service
also, in a way which they best liked, for his childlike
character and love for their young spirits made him deem
nothing unseemly, which would furnish them a pure amusement
and a happy hour. The girls would collect their
dolls, old, young, middle-aged, handsome, ugly and odd,
and he would marshal them into a dramatic corps, imagine
some play which would hit off their several characteristics,
and lead them through it with such nature and spirit, as to
entrance not only the children, but older spectators. Hilda's
doll in particular, which rejoiced in the full age of a century,
being an heirloom in her family, was made to play a
conspicuous part. Tall and rigid in her figure, wearing on
her brow the scars of many a life-battle, with a firm pursed
up mouth, which, if she could open it, would only berate
the degeneracy of the times; a square, practical nose, with
an iron-colored tip, the effect of many a snubbing from her
young duenna; black, staring eyes, which never looked
within, but forever spied out and speared the world's surface
faults; chin and cheeks expressive of entire self-satisfaction,
two fixed spots of red upon the latter, as if
defying old Time, and saying, "put me down if you dare,"
with no line of beauty but in the eyebrows, and they were
such a thread, that they gave but an iota of character to
her face. She was dressed in the fashion of the olden
time, with here and there a scrap of modern finery stuck
on her by Hilda, and her flying hair and crumpled cap

<!--- vol 1 page 62 -->

gave evidence that her ungrateful descendant (for she
called her granny,) was getting tired of her, and thinking
that it was almost time for her to be out of the way. This
image, Hans Christian made full use of, especially with
reference to Hilda, whom he understood like a book, and
so criticised and belabored her through her ancestor as to
make her almost afraid of her, and she would say to Zo&euml;,
after his departure, "I am going to lock up my old doll in
the closet, and she shan't come out for a whole week. I
wish Mr. Andersen would not make her so cross, for I
shall certainly hate her, and as she was my great-great
great-grandmother's, and mamma told me to be careful of
her, I don't want either to burn her or cut her up, or throw
her into the street for the naughty boys to laugh at. Isn't
it too bad?"</p>

<p>By fastidious critics among his countrymen, with whom
his simplicity and purity of mind and beautiful genius
went for but little when weighed against his awkward
figure and manners and proneness to egotism, he was said
to "carry his heart on a waiter;" but Miss Holberg thought
that he might reveal himself still more to his friends, and
yet retain within much more wealth of thought and feeling
than his uncharitable judges had in their whole stock in
warehouse or trade.</p>

<p>The great and good Thorwaldsen, to whom Art revealed
herself bright, lovely, chaste, severe and sanctified as she
is, whose countrymen have it not to reproach themselves
with that they were blind to his worth, was also an honored
guest at the mansion, and to him Zo&euml; bowed lowly and
reverently in her secret heart. To Hilda and herself, unlike
yet loving as they were, he always gave attention.
He called them his "Night and Morning." For the one,
jocund and wide-awake, soaring on rapid pinion through
the empyrean, scattering roses on her way, and lighted by
the flambeau of joy, he had a merry greeting or a playful
jest; but for the other, who with folded wing and half-closed

<!--- vol 1 page 63 -->

eye, drifted slowly wherever the breeze might
waft her, with her young thoughts and feelings asleep and
pressed closely to her breast, and attended by the grim
and ominous bird of night, screeching anon of evil to come,
his tenderness gushed forth. His gentle tones and soft
hand pressed caressingly upon her head, were a healing to
the pain which she felt, but knew not enough of herself to
reveal, and a hope to the sadness which moaned within
her, but which she was too much a stranger to happiness to
note.</p>

<p>"Come down into the drawing-room," said Hilda to Zo&euml;,
one evening just at twilight: "the great sculptor and Mr.
Andersen are both there, and Miss Ingemann and Miss
Holberg have walked out. Mr. Andersen has promised to
tell me a story, and Mr. Thorwaldsen asks if his little Night
has drawn so dark a shadow over her as not to be visible.
Come with me and I will chase it away as we enter his
presence, so that he may catch a glimpse of you."</p>

<p>They entered the room, Hilda in advance, when just as
she approached him, she stepped aside, and, in mock-heroic,
school-girl style, with a wave of the hand towards
her friend, repeated:</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Lo, evening flieth upon the steps of day,"</p>

</div>

<p>and then went to the window where Hans Christian was
standing. Zo&euml; stood by her honored friend, for, at the mature
age of nine she thought herself too old to sit upon
his knee as formerly, and besides he was very infirm.
Hilda begged for a story from Hans Christian.</p>

<p>"Which of my tales do you like best?" said he.</p>

<p>"The seven stories of the Snow Queen," said she; "but
Zo&euml; reads the Ugly Duck most, and says she thinks she is
like it."</p>

<p>"Only that I never expect to become a swan," said
Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"We went yesterday," said Hilda to Thorwaldsen, "to
see your works of art, sir, in the different public buildings.

<!--- vol 1 page 64 -->

and the last place was the cathedral, where are the Saviour
and the twelve apostles."</p>

<p>"And which do you like best of all of them?" asked
Thorwaldsen.</p>

<p>"O, my namesake, Morning, and next the Three Graces.
Those are beautiful." And she imitated the attitude of
one of them, lifting Mr. Andersen's hand to have him personate
another.</p>

<p>"No, no, you cannot make a grace of me, that is very
certain; but you must balance my homely mouth against
my stories which you say you like; my one sided nose you
must set against my little dramas; and as for my forehead,
why my music need not be very much ashamed of it,
though it retreats a little as if it did not care for it as much
as my little friends do. But where are you leading me?"
said he, as Hilda pulled him along towards the door.</p>

<p>"To see my new doll, which is sitting in the armchair
in the hall. I got tired with the scoldings of old granny,
and have put her away. This new one cannot pucker up
her pretty mouth to scold, if she tried, or if you do your
best to make her."</p>

<p>"It will depend on yourself," said he, "whether she
talks to please you. I can make her give you a hard lesson
if you are not good, even if she were as beautiful as
the new moon."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; was left alone with Thorwaldsen. "And which do
you like best of what you saw yesterday, my little Night?"
said he, tenderly laying his hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>For the first time since she left her mother's side was
she won to complete confidence, by the serious but mild
eye and deep inspiring voice of the artist.</p>

<p>"The Christ," she said; "and I dreamed last night that I
saw him passing by, with a covering upon his head suited
to the drapery he wore, and there seemed to be written all
over him: '<i>Venite ad me omnes</i>,'&mdash;'come unto me all.' I

<!--- vol 1 page 65 -->

rose to follow him, but I remembered that he could read
my thoughts, and I dared not go."</p>

<p>"But, my child, you have no thoughts which you fear to
hide from him, have you?" said he mildly but solemnly.</p>

<p>"I am afraid so. I make-believe a world within myself,
and I fear it is like telling an untruth. I always say when
I have asked Hilda not to talk, because I am going to
think, 'now this is making-believe, or supposing so and so,'
but yet I do not feel quite right about it. I hope it is not
wrong, sir?"</p>

<p>"Not if you do your little duties in the outer world, and
love real people better than your ideal ones," said he.</p>

<p>"Ah, that is the trouble. They are not so pretty or so
good as they are in my mind-world, where everybody does
what is beautiful and right, and that frets me, and worse
than this, I am not the same myself in Miss Ingemann's
school that I am in my thought home, and that vexes
me more than anything; and if I do not speak cross, I feel
so, and am often very unhappy, and the minister says that
only good and blessed people are in heaven, and I am
neither; so I fear I shall never go there."</p>

<p>" 'Come to me all,' the Christ says, Zo&euml;, which means
that we must be and do and think and feel as he would if

<!--- vol 1 page 66 -->

he now lived and worked among us. Remember this, my
child; obey his commands. Take, as it were, hold of his
hand when you pray to the great Father, and the right and
true will be plain, and happiness will come to you through
following these when you seek it not."</p>

<p>She still looked dissatisfied. "But what is right? Is it
always doing what we dislike to do? And is it wicked to
do what we most like, what makes us happy?"</p>

<p>"Tell me what you like to do and I can answer you
better."</p>

<p>"Nothing which Hilda and the other girls do. I soon
get tired of play; I do not like my lessons, nor my sewing
and knitting, nor any other work. I feel afraid of people
too much to wish to visit them. Even the poor, which Hilda
likes to work for and to teach many little things, trouble me
so much with their dirty houses and clothes and stare at me
so that I cannot go to them any more."</p>

<p>"But this is what you do not like. Now tell me what
makes you happy."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; looked down and struggled hard with her natural
reserve, then gazed a moment into Thorwaldsen's eyes and
answered:</p>

<p>"To make-believe myself the great, good, kind queen
of the whole world, and to think of all that I will do to
make its people happy and gain their love. This is all I
like to do, and O! it is so foolish," and she burst into tears.</p>

<p>Thorwaldsen paused. He remembered the dreams of
his youth and how God had enabled him to fulfill them,
and he reverenced those of this timid and aspiring yet
humble child.</p>

<p>"Zo&euml;," said he, "when a boy of your age, I too
dreamed of being the greatest sculptor of my country, and
raising the world to a higher and purer taste for Art. God
has enabled me to do so, and for it I daily bless his holy
name. But to be great and to do good, we must not merely
dream but labor and suffer and wait patiently upon his

<!--- vol 1 page 67 -->

will. Daily must you take up your cross, and in his own
good time you shall wear the crown which he sees to be
fitting for you."</p>

<p>"But how take up the cross?" said she, "never, never
to dream but do everything I do not like&mdash;is that the way?
O! life would be so hard! Did our Father in heaven intend
it should be so?"</p>

<p>Children ask puzzling questions, and even Thorwaldsen
knew not how to answer her directly.</p>

<p>"My child, I cannot say, but this is sure; obey your
conscience, read your Bible, let the Christ be your pattern
and guide through life, pray to the good God to be your
friend. Learn as much as you can of the works of his
beautiful world, and be not anxious for anything else&mdash;all
will be right with you. Will you do this?"</p>

<p>"I will try, sir," she said, and as the ladies entered the
room, she turned to leave it but with a firmer step and
brighter eye than ever before, for her life at that moment
was invested with an aim, which she was never to lose
sight of wherever it might lead her.</p>

<p>"Be gentle and forbearing with this little girl," said he
to Miss Ingemann, for she had before alluded to her dullness
of apprehension and want of interest in her studies;
"for time and patience may reveal some hidden power of
mind and character which may surprise and delight you.
Hers is no common spirit, I can assure you."</p>

<p>The next day Miss Ingemann sharpened her mental
gaze as she studied Zo&euml; from her elevated post of observation,
till her victim writhed as if her teacher's eye were a
cold steel point probing her flesh, and when she could not
escape her keen metaphysical scrutiny, she instinctively
threw out a darkening cloud in the shape of an unaccountable
impulse or eccentricity. That lady became
doubly certain that she was right in her judgment of her,
only that she had given her credit for more gentleness
than she deserved, and she wondered how so clear and

<!--- vol 1 page 68 -->

true a mind as Thorwaldsen's could suffer a fancy to mislead
him. O! when will it be seen that for no jugglery,
nor even at the rap of the clearest understanding will that
sacred thing, the human soul, reveal itself, but as deep
answereth only unto deep, so to the spiritually enlightened,
sympathetic and pure, to the little child in Christ's kingdom
alone will it give forth its most subtle odor and its
sweetest music.</p>

<p>"MR. K&Ouml;RNER tells me
that Thorwaldsen is very sick,"
said Miss Ingemann, as she seated
herself at the dinner table the next
day. "The physician has been
with him all the morning, and
speaks doubtfully of his recovery."</p>

<p>"I thought he seemed ill and
languid last evening," said Miss
Holberg, "and as he bade us good-by,
I was startled by his wan look
and tottering step; I feared he was not long for this world,
but could not bear to dwell upon the thought."</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 70 -->

<p>Zo&euml; quietly dropped her knife and fork, and her dinner
remained untasted. It attracted but little notice, for her
appetite was not an eager one, and her teacher would sometimes
say, "that if she would even <i>eat</i> with the relish of
the other girls, she should have more hope of her, for it
might serve as a clue to other capacities, if she had any
distinctive ones, but with such a dead level of a nature
as hers, what could she do?"</p>

<p>After dinner, the child retired to her room, and seated
herself by the window which commanded a view of the
artistes house. Hour after hour, she sat with book in
hand, but not once read, and watched the signs of his ebbing
life. She saw one physician after another hurry up
the steps with anxious mien; the little child checked by its
nurse in running noisily before the door; the servant with
open handkerchief wipe away his tears as he quieted the
restless, growling dog who strove to go to his master's
room, and the friend who came out for a brief moment to
stand with folded arms and serious thoughtful face against
a pillar, and then rouse himself and step hastily back as if
he would not lose a single breath of the dying Christian
artist; and over the whole scene, there was that mysterious,
sad quietness, unexplained by reason, but real to the
feelings, such as one is sensible of on entering a vacant
room, and knows that a friend is gone from the house by
the still air of the chairs and tables. By-and-by there
were other movements. The two physicians last called in,
came out together talking of the case, each one having his
own thought of its treatment, and well satisfied that he was
called in too late to save his life. Then the family medical
man with slow, thoughtful step, and face with no remorse
of aspect, but mournful, as if "Would God I could have
died for thee, my best friend and benefactor!" were written
in every line. At last the window was raised, the shutter
drawn and she knew that the form of the dead was composed

<!--- vol 1 page 71 -->

decently to his last rest, and that the spirit of him
who had given a hope to her life, had ascended.</p>

<p>Hilda ran into the room. "Why, what is the matter,
Zo&euml;, you look so sick?"</p>

<p>"Thorwaldsen is dead."</p>

<p>"Why, no, he is not. Miss Ingemann sent in at three
o'clock, and he was a little better then, and they had hope
of his life."</p>

<p>"He is dead," said Zo&euml;. Hilda gazed wonderingly at
her for a moment, and then broke into a loud cry. "O!
he must not be dead; I cannot have him die; the good
Thorwaldsen, who is always so kind, and I love him so
much; O dear! what shall I do," and she ran weeping
into the school-girls' sitting-room. "Thorwaldsen is dead,"
she exclaimed, between her sobs.</p>

<p>"Who told you so?" said half a dozen voices at once.</p>

<p>"Zo&euml;."</p>

<p>"O, the little raven! It is no such thing. I'll engage
she has not been out of her room this afternoon, and
strange as she is, I do not believe she has <i>second sight</i>,' "
said Rinda.</p>

<p>"He is though!" said Hilda, wiping her eyes, for the
slur upon her friend was fast diverting her grief from her
loss. "He is, for when Zo&euml; says a thing is certain, it
always is. He is dead," and she again wept aloud.</p>

<p>The day of his funeral came, and he was to be honored
in his burial as no subject of any realm had been before.
The king in deep mourning, was to receive the body at the
entrance of the church, and the crown prince, as President
of the Academy of Fine Arts, at the head of its members,
followed by the royal princes, and the principal officers of
state were to walk after the hearse. Troops, processions
of the different guilds, and orders of citizens were to form
the train of this national ceremony.</p>

<p>Miss Ingemann's school was to attend her to the
church, habited in white, with a scarf of black crossing the

<!--- vol 1 page 72 -->

shoulder and hanging down the side. One is not curious to
know how much the preparation for this pageant alleviated
their sorrow. It is sufficient, that from the oldest to the
youngest, there were love and veneration for the departed,
and the sad sense of loss was really felt according to each
one's character and capacity.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; watched the preparations, and with Miss Holberg's
help arranged her wardrobe, but with a strange feeling of
unreality, as if it were not for herself. The idea of doing
something to honor her friend, were it but sewing a straight
seam in her most skillful manner, was grateful to her, and
her imagination pictured a thrilling adoration, a deep and
manifest woe, as a necessary accompaniment, and a lasting
inspiration derived from the recital of his greatness, and
goodness.</p>

<p>She was too young and inexperienced to know that human
power is so limited in this life that though profound sentiment
may first suggest the ceremonial, yet when we are
doing the most to honor outwardly the departed, thus
spreading our feelings over a large surface, we are for the
time dismayed at their comparative shallowness. It is
well that it is so, for to give beauty and richness to life
there must be symbol and ceremony, and the various expressions
of deep poetic sentiment; and let the mind be
sufficiently engrossed by them to have them fitting and
beautiful, though at the time they may seem to detract from
the ethereal essence of feeling. But when the duty is
done and every untoward and vexatious circumstance is
softened to the memory or haply fades away from it
entirely, then rises the Ph&oelig;nix of holy and beautiful poetry
from the ashes of what may seem to the mistaken a too
material and meaningless rite. "For thus it becometh us
to fulfill all righteousness," and to him who simply and
reverently obeys without questioning the dictates of nature
and religion, the great alchemist will in time reveal the
reward.</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 73 -->

<p>Zo&euml; sat by herself and mourned silently for her loss.
Too young to reason much, constitutionally sentimental,
early thrown into circumstances which favored reserve, not
understood by her teacher, she was fast growing morbid
and unnatural by a one-sided development. Like the passion-flower
torn up by the roots and planted against a wall
of ice, the tendrils of her soul spread hither and thither
striving instinctively to reach some support. With the
elements of a self-sacrificing, aspiring life prematurely
developing, of a nervous and anxious temperament, she
had found relief and hope through confiding in Thorwaldsen,
and at night she scarcely slept for the joyful visions
which visited her. The great artist was her friend. He,
too, had dreamed like herself, and to him she would go to
slake her yearning to be loved and feel that she could look
straight into his eye without being repelled by a wondering,
critical stare. Now her hope was cut off. With this
painful experience adding a long term to her life, she was
again thrust back upon herself, and her feelings at first
stunned, now gushed forth in uncontrollable weeping.</p>

<p>"How foolish I am!" she said to herself; "as if a little
girl of nine has a right to be so sorry because this great
man, whom all Denmark and the world worship, has died.
He never said much to me and I less to him, and Miss
Ingemann always seemed afraid lest I should trouble him
when I stood by his knee. I would not have her know
that I was crying so for him for the world. I will wash
my eyes that she may not see my tears. But! was not
his soft hand upon my head like this cold bath to my eyelids?
I never, never shall feel it again!" and she burst
forth afresh. "But I must control myself, as Miss Ingemann
calls it. I will go to the window and look out and
think of something else. There sits a poor tired man in
the street, and two little children are giving him something,
and he stretches out his hand and pats their heads.
It looks like Thorwaldsen's Christ blessing little children.

<!--- vol 1 page 74 -->

O, I never shall hear him tell me again of the Christ and
make me feel as if I could be like him! What, what shall
I do! I am afraid the feeling which made me so happy
will leave me;" and she clasped her hands and looked up
as in earnest entreaty. "But hush! some one is coming.
No, the step has passed by; but I must get ready to go to
the funeral. How the crowds begin to pour along! how
eager they are to get a place where they can see the
parade well! This is their way of being sorry, I suppose.
But can I walk in the long procession, with the bright sun
shining into my face so that people can see me, if I cannot
help crying? And how can I help it when everybody has
lost a friend, and I the most of all! And they will say:
'The great and good Thorwaldsen is dead!' And the
organ will play so mournfully, and that I cannot bear up
under. I shall certainly groan and cry aloud. O no! I
cannot go to the funeral. I must stay by myself. I must,
I must;" and she threw herself upon the bed and hid her
face in the pillow to still her sobs.</p>

<p>Miss Holberg came into the room&mdash;"Come, my dear, I
will help you to dress before I make my own toilet."</p>

<p>"I cannot go to the funeral."</p>

<p>"Not go to our friend's funeral!" But seeing the
child's swollen eyes, she guessed the cause, and she knew
her well enough to speak gently, but not to go to the deepest
springs of her nature to console her. "Yes, dear, I
see. We all loved Thorwaldsen, and feel very sad to lose
him; but we must submit to God's will and do our best to
honor his memory. You wish to do that, do you not?"</p>

<p>"O Miss Holberg! let me stay at home; please, please,
do! I feel as if I should drop down in the street. Do ask
Miss Ingemann to let me!"</p>

<p>She really looked so sick and miserable and her step
tottered so, that knowing she was not strong, she feared
she would not sustain the fatigue, and therefore, went to
Miss Ingemann and reported her state.</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 75 -->

<p>She was disappointed to have her arrangements disturbed,
for the brunette and blonde were to form a pretty
contrast in the procession, and really sorry that the child
should have one of those troublesome headaches so malapropos;
but she was too busy to see her personally, and
directing that some simple remedies should be given her
pupil, she accompanied the others to the church.</p>

<p>So Zo&euml; lost the opportunity of regulating her sensibilities,
diseased by solitude, and her idiosyncrasies of temperament,
by the healthy influence of contact with other minds
and right participation in a becoming pageant; but she sat
alone exaggerating the grief of the audience, and the
desolation caused by their loss, till a morbid impression
was fixed in her mind by an event which might otherwise
have been presented to her under such inspiring aspects.
For this born peasant, but nature's noble, from humble
poverty and a frigid clime had worked his way upward to
a post which kings looked up to, and had drawn from his
calm but burning soul, images of beauty, sanctity and
power, which the world has caught glimpses of enough to
honor, but which are to inspire and lead the human soul
far in the distant future.</p>

<p>And now, that the drapery of mortality had fallen from
him, he stands revealed as two great lives, one upon earth
so vailed as not to startle, but to allure to excellence; the
other, "where no eye hath seen, nor ear heard, nor heart
conceived"&mdash;the glory which shall be revealed to the
lovers and doers of <i>the good!</i></p>

<p>Poor Zo&euml;! her young heart was only too alive to the
power and beauty of the first life; and what a light is
quenched, when a great and pure nature bids adieu to it!
But to balance this premature sensibility, there were needed
a deeper and more inspiring mode of consolation, a clearer
insight into the other, than her teacher gave her, and she
suffered accordingly.</p>

<p>"MOTHER, here is Mr. Ernest's gardener, with
your plants which he promised you. Shall I ask him
to carry them into the yard?" said Fred K&ouml;rner, one
bright morning early in the month of May.</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy, and say, I thank Mr. Ernest, for his
kindness."</p>

<p>As soon as that bright notable lady had finished her household
arrangements for the morning above stairs, dusting here
and there a bureau or table in her bedroom, smoothing a
wrinkle left in the counterpane, picking up the threads from
the carpet, she went into the parlor. Before one could count
twenty, there was a general overturn of the furniture; sofas
were wheeled from one corner to the other; the great chairs
had an easy hob-nobbing squint given to each other, as
they were stationed at opposite angles; and she mentally
resolved, that on the first leisure day she would pull up
those set-looking bookcases by the roots, and let them
know that they were not to stand still all their lives in this
age of progress. They should change sides like the politicians
all over the world.</p>

<p>Here was little Denmark all in a fuss and fury about
Schleswig Holstein, her husband's birthplace. She hoped
it would have its own way for his sake, and had she not
read the American newspapers, which Mrs. Stephenson,
the minister's wife from that country, had lent her?

<!--- vol 1 page 77 -->

<p>She had borrowed them at first to improve her knowledge
of the idioms of the English language, but there was
such life and fun and information in those New York
papers, especially in one called the <i>Tribune</i>, that she must
read them weekly.</p>

<p>"No, no, her bookcases should not be old fogies, they
should march with the times; and if some day she could
catch her brother-in-law, the Lutheran minister, whose
church she attended, and who doted even on the odor of
an old book&mdash;no, she believed on the whole it was a new
one&mdash;would not they have a good time in making a
thorough revolution among them? And those old pamphlets,
they should make a bonfire unless the parson wanted
them, which he no doubt would. What a saint his wife
must be to suffer so much old lumber about! Poor victim,"
she thought, "on the whole she would not offer them to
him, but for her sake put them into the fire at once."</p>

<p>After giving the last touch and turn to the ornaments
about the room, to make them look as unlike to themselves
as possible, she went into her little yard.</p>

<p>It would not be called a large territory by a countryman,
but for the city, it was not to be despised by any
means, and with the contributions of her different friends,
especially Mr. Ernest's, and what the seed-store afforded,
and the hot-house plants from Mr. Hoffman that he had
just brought her, which would give the last touch to its
glory, she already saw in her fancy quite a little greenery
around her.</p>

<p>"Yes, her house, with its surroundings, should be a real
home to her in the best sense, and it should be a resting-place
to the soul of her beloved when he returned each
night from his labors, and her children should have sweet
and lovely associations through its beauty with their childhood;
and how easy it would be, through the springing
grass and blooming flowers, to lead their thoughts and affections
to the good Giver of all this enjoyment!</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 78 -->

<p>"And then it would be an oasis for the eye of the traveler
upon the dusty highway; and would she not have
flowers, not only to brighten and fill her own rooms with
incense, but for her friends also&mdash;those dear ones who had
received her with open arms when she came a young
stranger from the country, with her simple ways, to meet
what she feared were the stiff conventionalisms of a city?"
But she felt them not, for love and kind deeds had ever
attended her&mdash;so she thought as she untied the string which
bound them together.</p>

<p>"A pear tree! what a thrifty one! you shall climb against
that tall fence, and make the most of yourself. Four grape-vines!
you will be good enough to cover that out-building
as soon as it pleases you. Eight currant bushes! my favorite
fruit. Won't I have fresh individual ones for tea instead
of those conglomerates from the market? Six rose bushes!
please to arrange yourselves according to your color
and capacity, whether as climbers or staid conservatives.
And ivy! that is a radical, even if you place it against a
dead wall, more so for that, my old, young favorite! cling
there if you please. Honeysuckle! you angel, shedding
your fragrance most when the damps of life fall upon you,
cover my lattice&mdash;the sooner the better! Here is one that
looks like a mere walking-stick; but nevertheless, it shall
have its place. Who knows but that it is cousin, far removed,
to Aaron's rod, and that it may bud more marvelously
than any of the others? Now for my hoe and
trowel!</p>

<p>"But where is that precious husband of mine? He said
he would stay from the office and help me; that he would
only step out for a moment while I was arranging things
in-doors.</p>

<p>"I dare say I shall not see him until dinner time&mdash;perhaps
not before night. O dear! I wonder if it was intended
that husbands should live in dull, dirty notaries' offices and
dingy, dark wholesale stores four-fifths of their lives! They

<!--- vol 1 page 79 -->

must be a deal better than I am, if their souls don't get
soiled and rusty with such base contact all the time.</p>

<p>"But business must be attended to! Business! what
does it all amount to? Stirring up a grand hurry-scurry,
each one striving to get up in the world and thrust his
neighbor below, putting everything upside down, wrong
side up and out of the way generally, till Providence in
the form of a <i>crash</i>, throws everything into <i>pi</i>, and gives
men an opportunity to begin anew in a better way! But
do they! that is the thing! At any rate they have the
chance, and the worse for them if they do not. I don't
mean that my dear husband is one of those cackling biddies
in male attire, who go scratching about with their heads
towards the ground, as if it was their <i>mission</i> to pick up
the fattest worm in the earth, and what they cannot eat, to
hide away to putrefy, so that other hungry hens can't get
it&mdash;and the next thing you know of them, they are waking
up the babies and disturbing the neighborhood by their
noisy cackle&mdash;and when you go to see what the matter is,
there is only one little egg after all. And then with the
best luck, only a wee little chicken comes out of it, and
ten to one the silly fool scratches its eye out digging for
another worm.</p>

<p>"But how my thoughts run! O, my husband I was
thinking of! No, no, he is honest, generous, and whole-souled;
but he has got into the whirl, so away he spins
from morning to night.</p>

<p>"O dear! again I say! He will certainly go blind with
that pain in his eyes, or crazy with those headaches; and
then what will the money he is heaping up for his wife and
children&mdash;for I know that it is for us he works&mdash;be worth
to us! If I don't make him turn over a new leaf I am not
so great a woman as he thinks I am.</p>

<p>"But I hear the bell ring! never mind, Mahomet won't
go to the mountain this time, the mountain shall come to
him! Louise! whoever it is, send them out here.</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 80 -->

<p>"Mr. St&auml;rke! your most obedient! And to what fortunate
combination of events may I attribute this early call?
Why, the sun is up yet, and is not eclipsed either. You
can see to work! For mercy sake don't lose a minute!
You will feel poverty-stricken to-morrow if you do."</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mrs. K&ouml;rner," bowing, "how facetious
you are! The key of the safe was forgotten, and all the
papers needed for our present work are in it. I will thank
you for it."</p>

<p>"And can't Mr. K&ouml;rner do anything until you return?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of consequence; he desired me to call as I
had an errand this way, and the clerk was not at hand."</p>

<p>"Good! no better time than the present then to commence
my reform. No! I shall not give you the key, my
friend, and more than that, you are going to stay yourself
and help me; what say you?"</p>

<p>"I should be most happy, Mrs. K&ouml;rner, at any other
time, but really, our business is very imperative and I cannot
be spared."</p>

<p>"So is mine, and I can't spare you either. Please take
this hoe and dig a place for the root of this pear tree."</p>

<p>"But, my dear Mrs. K&ouml;rner, our clients are waiting and
they have already pressed us to hasten their cause, and&mdash;and&mdash;I
must confess that I am a little selfish about it too,
for you know, I have just been chosen junior partner and
I am very desirous of fulfilling my part of the duties of the
office."</p>

<p>"You cannot do it better than by aiding your partner's
wife, and I will prove it to you in religious and poetical
form&mdash;which is a deal better than your dry legalities&mdash;before
you leave.</p>

<p>"Please take the hoe! Is Mr. St&auml;rke impolite to a lady?
What portents are there in the heavens to correspond with
such an anomaly? (looking all over the sky). Take it,
please, I will answer for you to the court, judge, and jury,
and lead you away from them with flying colors.</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 81 -->

<p>"There, thank you! I knew you would aid a distressed&mdash;not
damsel exactly, but something fully as good
and quite as forlorn&mdash;a deserted wife; who spends the
honeymoon, gives life to and trains up her babies in the
fear and love of the Lord, or mayhap in terror of his black
majesty, works out life's problem, whether it be dark or
joyful, prepares for heaven or haply sinks into the other
state, wears away with disease dies and is buried with
what? the devoted love of her husband, to be sure, which
proves itself by his digging his own grave prematurely in
nervously searching for a paltry treasure that any ill-wind
may blow away! And, in the meantime, makes an evening
call to play with the children, spends a weary night to
get up half-refreshed in the morning, breakfasts in haste,
dines, if at all, in a trice, and sups upon the vanity and
vexation of spirit of the whole day.</p>

<p>"There, is not that a true picture of married life at the
present day? I mean of the best and happiest marriages&mdash;of
those who are called <i>well to do in the world</i> in every
way?"</p>

<p>"There is some truth in it, I confess, but what would
you have? It seems to be the order of society, and pardon
me, but you look pretty happy under the administration."</p>

<p>"So I am; who would not be with my glorious husband?
but don't you think I could be happier in a truer and higher
style? I should like to have the trial, I know, and I intend
to have it too.</p>

<p>"There! you have planted that nicely. Now for the
grape-vines! O! I see you will be tolerably educated under
my supervision, before you marry. I will give you a lesson
from time to time, and then for the wedding-cake; I
will make it for you according to my mother's receipt. It
is the best that ever was."</p>

<p>"O! that event is a long way in the future. I must
make the fortune first, which you seem to despise so much
this morning."</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 82 -->

<p>"No, you will do no such thing! You will marry before
you are a thousand dollars richer. What is the use of a
fortune to begin life with, when you have a head and two
hands and health into the bargain?"</p>

<p>"I should feel that it was very selfish to inflict poverty
and self-sacrifice upon a delicate, high-bred young lady,
and really, you would not wish me to be satisfied with any
other."</p>

<p>"If you mean refined and well-bred, I say no; but do not
ask our rosy Danish girls to grow sickly, sentimental, and
learned, like that pale American young lady opposite. She
looks like an Anemone, beautiful, it is true, and of celestial
birth apparently, but as if she would bloom only a
month in the spring and then be laid low. Mrs. Stephenson
says that many of the young girls in her country are
like her fair cousin. They live in furnace-heated rooms
in winter and go out but little, but study, read, attend to
music, poetize, and dream of a higher life than the present
affords them, till they are sick, nervous, and if they do not
become insane they sink into an early grave, or, heaven
save us! mount the rostrum or pulpit; or what is a little
better, flood the country with their mental effusions in
print!</p>

<p>"No, no! marry a sensible, healthy little damsel, contented
with this sublunary state for the present, who likes nothing
so well as to begin at the lower round of the ladder with
you, so that you may have the satisfaction of climbing to
the top together.</p>

<p>"But stop, if you please! Don't plant that honeysuckle
in that north corner, where the sun never shines, and close
by that stiff-looking snow-ball that is too pure and cold ever
to blush, but here in this sunny spot, that it may be supported
by this trellis without being shaded too much. And
now, as you are too good ever to be angry, I am going to
give you a fact or two, which your blunder forces upon me.</p>

<p>"If the young men of the present day, especially of the

<!--- vol 1 page 83 -->

learned professions, would be a little less proper, and a
little more chivalrous, a little less worthy in the hum-drum
sense, and a little more enthusiastic in their love for the
dear Lord and their fair young neighbors, to say the least,
a little less politic and sort of make-believe in their sieges
upon hearts&mdash;like the English army before Sevastopol, but
march up more in the 'deliver, or (not <i>you</i>, but <i>I</i>,) die'
style of olden time, I can tell you, women would not require
you to wear yourselves out in getting a fortune for
them, but they could not withstand you at all. Fortunes
without poetry and love are quite indispensable, but with
them they are esteemed a convenience, or otherwise as
you happen or not to have them."</p>

<p>"All that is very fine, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no tender spot in you for it to sink into, you
mean. O, the degeneracy of the men of the present!
Well, we shall see.</p>

<p>"Come, my roses, you shall bloom and console me for
the superabundance of Lombardy poplars all about this
blessed city. They give it such a stiff, prosy look, and
turn their branches upwards as if the sweet heavens needed
their shade instead of us poor mortal women. But you
need not think I speak from a sense of my own wrongs.
My husband was, is, and ever will be, '<i>le preux chevalier,
sans peur, sans reproche</i>', excepting that he works too
hard for me.</p>

<p>"Here, my beautiful white rose! friend of my childhood!
stand there, at the right of the George the Fourth; royalty
and simplicity side by side. That is well, and my Superbe
shall climb this wall, and be the back-ground of both."</p>

<p>"You seem at no loss where to put your plants, but it is
take aim, and down with you!"</p>

<p>"Of course, that is a part of my inspiration, you see; it
requires nothing else.</p>

<p>"Now, they are all set but this Ampelopsis, which my
friend, Mr. Weiss, saint as he is, brought me yesterday,

<!--- vol 1 page 84 -->

and I am so little acquainted with it, that I do not know
what site it wants to make it contented. I will wait until
Mr. K&ouml;rner comes."</p>

<p>"I thought your inspiration was sufficient? Excuse me,
but it seems to have failed already."</p>

<p>"Now, is not that a mistake worthy of a man of a clear
understanding, who depends upon a chain of reasoning,
ratiocination as he calls it&mdash;what a hard word&mdash;to sustain
himself and the universe. This mistake of yours,
proves it is insufficient. If you would but condescend
to make use of the brighter lamps which God gives
us, as we women are thankful to do, you would be a great
deal better, and more interesting than you now are, with
your dry logic and masses of facts; and you would not
make that remark, pardon me, so wanting in psychological
insight, as our metaphysical friend, Gottfried, would call
it. For, have you not learned yet, what it is to be a
prophet?"</p>

<p>"I must plead some doubt upon the subject."</p>

<p>"Why, it is the simplest thing in the world, when it is
once learned, my sister, 'Lisbet' told me, who knows a
scrap of almost everything. It is to profit by everything in
nature, God's Word, by men, women, and children, and all
they say and do&mdash;indeed everything in this great universe,
in which our Father has placed us. Now, if you can tell
what on this earth is a greater inspiration to me than your
honored partner, I wish you to do so.</p>

<p>"What! does the learned notary look puzzled? I dare
say now, that he has always pictured to himself a seer staring
up into vacancy, with a pen in his hand, and a scroll
on the table beside him, waiting for some angel, or, mayhap
evil one, to blow the divinity out of that vulgar-looking
trumpet that may be seen sticking out of some clouds near,
instead of learning about the lilies of the field and the fowls
of the air, as our Saviour did. This comes not from your
Bible, you may be sure of that; you men are too proud

<!--- vol 1 page 85 -->

and unenlightened in these days&mdash;excuse me, to read that
much; but from always pulling upon that old, broken chain
that you call ra-ti-oc-i-na-tion! no wonder that you tumble
over so often, with your nicely-laid plans. You deserve
to, for trusting so much to such an antiquated, second-rate
affair, good in its place, but not to be made so much of as
you wise men of Gotham do."</p>

<p>"Thank you for the idea, I am not quite sure of its
correctness, however."</p>

<p>"You will try if it fits into your old chain, will you,
before you adopt it? Well, it does, and it does not, but
it is true notwithstanding.</p>

<p>"Now we will give one survey of our labor, and then I
will release you from your thraldom. Yes, it will do, and
when I get a few shrubs from Mrs. Farrel's, which I had
almost forgotten she had promised me, it will be as full as
I wish it. Strange that that lady should have such a kind
and friendly face and heart with such a thunder-cloud of a
creed! I think she must get her faith, after all, more from
the New Testament and her pretty garden, than she does
from that hobgoblin from the middle ages, that stalks about
and takes up so much room in these days! But here is
Mr. K&ouml;rner."</p>

<p>"Well," said he, as he greeted them with beaming face,
"if there isn't the truant! Mr. St&auml;rke, what account can
you give of yourself?"</p>

<p>"I have none, sir; I rely on the interposition of Mrs.
K&ouml;rner; I refer you to her."</p>

<p>"Why, what! he has only been acting up to the mission
of your sex, to do the rough work of the world, while I
was the subtle, moving spirit of the scene. The plants
must be set, and he has done it very well. I thank him."</p>

<p>"Ah, Lina! Isn't she great! And here are my boys,
the very best in Copenhagen! Aren't you glad to see your
old man, Emile? Yes, you are. But where is Fred?"</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 86 -->

<p>"Here he is coming across the street from Mr. Stephenson's."</p>

<p>"What is the matter with my boy?" seeing him swallowing
with great effort some grief. "What has young America
done to you now, my dear?"</p>

<p>"He 'walked into my young affections,' as he said; but
I call it a pretty hard blow that he gave me." And the lad
ran off to stifle his sobs.</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Stephenson crossed the street.</p>

<p>"What has my boy done to yours, Mrs. K&ouml;rner? I am
very sorry that he should behave so, but he is really quite
unmanageable."</p>

<p>"O, nothing of consequence; it was a childish quarrel
between Fred and him."</p>

<p>"I left him crying, because, as he said, he had <i>hit</i>
Fred."</p>

<p>"Well, the millennium must be at hand, if the striker
cries for the deed and the stricken controls himself. Won't
you walk in?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you, our dinner is ready."</p>

<p>"So is ours; come, Mr. K&ouml;rner!"</p>

<p>"Come, come, Mr. St&auml;rke," said her husband, "walk in;
we have got a swell dinner, as Andrew Jackson over the
way would say."</p>

<p>"No; I had a little rather he would not; Eliza is cleaning
house and I have not a repast worthy of our friend today.
You understand me, Mr. St&auml;rke?"</p>

<p>"O, certainly, certainly; and I am very glad to have you
speak so plainly. Good morning!"</p>

<p>"There is a man who would not disgrace a judgeship
any day, though the wig would surmount rather young
shoulders to be sure," said Mrs. K&ouml;rner.</p>

<p>"Yes, he has knowledge and stability enough for one,
and as for his principles and opinions, why you know our
sister 'Lisbet' says he is ninety years old, as it regards
them."</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 87 -->

<p>"I don't want him to be judge," said Fred, "for then I
am afraid he will not play with me any more, nor draw pictures
for us."</p>

<p>"Never fear that, dear," said his mother; "if Mr. St&auml;rke
is a little too old in his judgment of men and their doings
in this world, he is simple, loving, and thoughtful for my
children's happiness, and for that he wins me, and no judge's
seat or wig will spoil him in these points. And remember,
Fred, if you would be as good a lawyer and writer as he
is, and at the same time not grow too sober and careworn
as your years increase, you must be careful to do everything
in its season, as he did, for when a boy in your
uncle's school, he got his lessons well and learned to draw;
in College he was always faithfully at his post, and now it
is easy for him to work at perplexing law cases all the day,
and in the evening come and talk and entertain me and
my friends, or play with you."</p>

<p>"MY birthday! I am sixteen
years of age! That is pretty old,
I but I feel just like a little girl yet.
Hilda is a year older, to-be-sure, but
she is a good deal larger than I, and
she appears already like Miss Gr&uuml;nberg
and Trener, who dress gayly
and carry their heads so straight as
if they were afraid of nobody. I
wonder if I ever can do so! It looks
pretty in them. Let me try. (She walks to the mirror
and imitates them.) No; it is only make-believe with

<!--- vol 1 page 89 -->

me, so it looks silly. Mrs. Stephenson used to say I
looked like a Quaker. What does that mean? A person
with a sober, plain face like me, I guess. I am afraid of
her and of almost everybody else but Hilda, and I never
like to go anywhere without her; she is always so kind and
talks to people, so it is no matter if I do not. O this hard
lesson! I must study it. (Looks on the book for a few
moments and then gazes on vacancy.) I will try to see my
mamma with my mind's eye. It is so very, very long since
I left her: how does she look! I wonder if she is dark
like me or white like Miss Ingemann; if she is pretty like
Hilda or plain like Rinda. I can't remember, but this I
always can call to mind, that she would smile very kindly
and call me 'dear,' and make a little cooing noise like a
dove when I had been good, and that her forehead would
have wrinkles in it when I was naughty, and I would be so
sorry to see them coming one, two, three after the other,
and then I would say I would be good and they would all
smooth away again. O! how I wish I could see her and
that she would again put me into my little bed at night, (for
I don't want to be anything but a child still,) and hear me
say 'Our Father,' for I am weary, weary of longing, longing
for something and it must be for my dear, dear, faraway
mother: and my papa, too, I remember him, tall and
dark and very thoughtful. And he would sit under the
veranda and look out upon the blue sea&mdash;for that is before
me now&mdash;and talk to himself and shake his head a little
as his lips moved. And he would gaze at me so earnestly
and sadly&mdash;and he liked to have me lively and active&mdash;energetic
and decided he called it. I am afraid I never
shall be; but here is Hilda."</p>

<p>"Have you got your lesson in algebra, Zo&euml; dear?" said
she, for she was very much afraid of her falling under the
teacher's reproof in this study which she much disliked.
The rudiments of arithmetic she easily mastered, but algebra
and geometry were like an unknown tongue to her,

<!--- vol 1 page 90 -->

and to attempt to make her comprehend or solve their problems
was like dashing water upon a steel surface, which
evaporated without one drop being absorbed.</p>

<p>"No," said she, "and I can't. I don't know what Miss
Ingemann sets me at this for! She might just as well
pour water upon that stove expecting it to soak in. It will
only crack it and raise a great steam, just as my head is
nearly split by this puzzling sum, and there is a thick blur
over my eyes, I have looked at it so long."</p>

<p>"Let me help you," said Hilda, who was quick at
figures.</p>

<p>"O no! thank you. That would be untrue, for she said
I must do it myself, but I can't and there is an end of the
matter. I was not made to study algebra. I know enough
of arithmetic to count the money when I go shopping and
to pay my laundress, and that is all that I shall want."</p>

<p>"But what if your father should leave an estate for you
to settle?"</p>

<p>"I could take care of it without knowing about <i>a</i> plus
<i>b</i> and <i>c</i> minus <i>d</i>."</p>

<p>"But you must at least know about simple and compound
interest."</p>

<p>"No, for I am going to lend my money just as I do my
books to you when you want them, or my prettiest ribbon
to Freya when she goes visiting, or my seed bracelet to
Adelgunda when she wants to make 'a sensation,' as she
says. I don't tell you that you must put a new cover on every
book you borrow, or that Rinda must pin another piece of
ribbon to the one I lend her to pay for its use, or that
Freya must hang a gold charm to my bracelet every time
she wears it. I should be ashamed to be so mean and
selfish. That is not the way they did in those days I like
to read about eighteen hundred years ago, nor will it
be so in the good time I can't help thinking will come
by-and-by."</p>

<p>"I guess that you will have plenty of people to borrow

<!--- vol 1 page 91 -->

your money. Why, they will tease it all away if they
know you don't ask interest."</p>

<p>"Don't you think I can say 'No!' if I think they don't
deserve it. I should ask 'our Father' when one asked me for
it whom I did not know about, if I should lend to him, and
I should try and learn about him or her, and whether it
would be right and useful to them to have it; and if I made
up my mind that it would, I would lend it till they could
pay it again&mdash;just the sum that I lent them and no more.
But if I thought that it would do more harm than good, I
would say, 'No, you must not have it;' and as I should
feel sorry to disappoint them, I should look and say so,
and perhaps that would do a little toward making them
better, and as soon as God was willing I would let them
have it, and I don't think he would make me wait till they
were perfect seeing that none of the rest of us are, not
even Miss Ingemann."</p>

<p>"O Zo&euml;, darling!" said Hilda, throwing her arms about
her, "I wish that you would try to do just as our teacher
wishes you to do, so that she may love you dearly as she
does me. She is so kind to me, and I am so fond of her
that my only trouble is that you don't seem to understand
each other, so she gets angry with you and you look so
sad, or if you do laugh and frolic, it seems like froth and
foam on the surface of the deep moving sea, and it makes
me feel worse than to have you sit quiet, as you do so
much of the time. I try to explain matters to both of you
and make it appear that you neither of you are in the
wrong, but both mean the very best; but it is of no use,
and it makes me very unhappy." And she kissed her
and began to arrange her curls while she hummed a
little tune.</p>

<p>"No, Hilda! it is of no use," said Zo&euml; seriously; "Miss
Ingemann does not like anything about me. I am not
clever, like you and the other girls, about my lessons. I
get them <i>by rote</i>, she says, and to-be-sure I do, all but my

<!--- vol 1 page 92 -->

natural theology and grammar and rhetoric and my Bible
lesson. I like <i>them</i>, and when Miss Ingemann wishes
to show me off she does right to question me in those
studies."</p>

<p>"But there are other matters that you trouble her about;
your hair is not always arranged neatly to suit her, and
your shoes are sometimes down at the heel and your hose
are too much darned, and then you sometimes lay your
sewing implements and books about, and as she is very
particular and nice it tries her; and it is not all for that
either, but she really wishes you to grow up a tidy, sensible,
intelligent, and elegant young lady."</p>

<p>"Yes, Hilda, I know it, and you need not think that I
don't thank her for it in my heart, though I don't kiss her
and tell her so as much as you do. But I know this too,
for though I am a little dark-girl, I can see through a cloud
when the moon shines through it, as well as Miss Ingemann
or any other bright person. She wants me to be
sensible in just her way, and intelligent in just her way,
and elegant in just her way; and if I am not, she won't
own that I am at all. Now that is not what God intends,
else He would have made me more like her. She does
not like my curly hair, and when she wants to show that
she is particularly kind, she takes both her hands and tries
to smooth it and she says, 'Zo&euml;, my dear, put on your bonnet
and may-be your complexion will improve;' or, 'Zo&euml;,
you see how straight Adelgunda sits, I wish you not to
lounge so;' or, 'Zo&euml;, look! Freya has knit this pair of stockings
in two weeks, you must be industrious like her;' or,
'Hilda has an excellent mind, she is so quick in her
algebra;' and then looks at me as much as to say, '<i>you
have not!</i>' "</p>

<p>"Why how you talk, child! what an imagination you
have!"</p>

<p>"It is not imagination, it is plain fact; and though Miss
Ingemann is very good and knows almost everything in

<!--- vol 1 page 93 -->

books and all about the great people who have lived since
the flood, and is '<i>au fait</i>,' as she is always saying, 'to the
conventionalisms of society,' there is one of 'our Father's'
little girls about five feet high, that she knows precious
little about, and it is a pity since she pretends to teach
her."</p>

<p>"Aren't you funny?" said Hilda, laughing.</p>

<p>"It may be fun to you, but it is anything else to me;
when my mind is in such a hurly-burly state and I only
know that I must be made for something, but I don't know
what, and if Miss Ingemann would go the right way to
puzzle me out and then tell me, I should be much more
thankful to her than I am while she distresses herself about
whether I am dark, or white as a piece of chalk with two
strawberries stuck on it, or my hair flax-colored and as lank
and straight as a tallow candle, or black and curly as my
own, or whether I bend a little before the cold north wind
always blowing upon me, or take it all as firm and erect as
if I were a piece of Thor's ramrod set down here on the
earth. Leave these things to 'our Father' who made me,
and teach me something of more importance, I say."</p>

<p>"Good," said Hilda, "I like to see you so, because your
face has some spirit in it. But you can't deny but your
habits of study and behavior are of some importance."</p>

<p>"O yes! But what if I do set my thimble by my plate
while I dine; she need not look and speak as if I had
smashed Moses' two tables of stone with all the commandments
upon them; or, if Freya does knit like a steam
engine, the globe is not kept together by it, as I know of;
or, if you can reckon a million, that does not redeem all
the souls in the world, does it, my own best Hilda?"</p>

<p>"O no, indeed, I hope not. Save me from any such
awful responsibility. I am afraid my own will fly away into
space some day I am such a giddy thing; but do, Zo&euml;, wear
clean white skirts, and nice fine hose all the time, to please
Miss Ingemann and me, too, dear! won't you?"

<!--- vol 1 page 94 -->

<p>"Now that is just like Miss Ingemann; and you, too,
Hilda dear! you say so to save me from disgrace with her;
but she has always had money enough all her life, and,
besides, only associates with a few elegant, tasteful people
as fortunate as herself, so she does not seem to think but
that everybody may dress as well as she does. Now my
father is not rich, and he has many poor relatives whom he
helps in their living, and it is very expensive keeping me
here, and though he is generous, yet I know he wants me
to be economical, so I am, and&mdash;I wish Miss Ingemann
would turn her sublime gaze to the stars, and not look at
my stockings."</p>

<p>"But at any rate, as she says, there is water enough in
the river and your skirts might be clean."</p>

<p>"How, without great expense in this filthy, smoky city, I
should like to know? Look at the piles of dirt in the street,
and see that great chimney belching out a column of black
smoke. I wonder if it is the evil deeds of the proprietor,
ascending to the bar of heaven to be judged in that form!
And don't we bury ourselves before our time every walk
we take. To be really and thoroughly decent as I like to
be, for I am as nice in my taste as Miss Ingemann, it
would take all my allowance money for my washing, and I
can't spare it, when I must have new clothes once in a
while; and that is just the way she judges and teaches
me. No, Hilda! I had a teacher once, and in five minutes
he pointed out to me the way to walk through life, and to
me it seems so simple and plain that I wonder when I
attempt to keep in it that all good people do not bid me
God speed! and take hold of my hand and help me onwards,
instead of making me turn aside into their by-paths.
I do not say that they are by-paths to them, but when I try
them to see if they were made for me, I feel so wretched
and away from home and the sunlight of God's favor, that
I shrink into myself and begin again my ceaseless questioning."</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 95 -->

<p class="small">(<i>A voice calls Hilda</i>.)</p>

<p>"Dear Zo&euml;! I must go. You are better, O! so much
better than I am, and I love you dearly! I only say these
things to you because it frets me not to have Miss Ingemann
see you as I do, and if some little things were altered in
you I think she would."</p>

<p>"No, Hilda! I am not as good as you. It is so easy for
you to do just what you were made for, that I admire and
look up to you all the time, and you are so kind to let me
lean upon you, and you cover up my failings so beautifully
when we go abroad together! But I am nothing but one
cluster of interrogation points, always longing to do my
duty but not knowing how, throwing the past behind in
disgust, having no life and interest in the present, and yet
what am I fit for in the future of such a world as this?
But go, dear!"</p>

<p class="small">(<i>Zo&euml; alone</i>.)</p>

<p>" 'Obey your conscience; read your Bible; let the Christ
be your pattern and guide; take, as it were, hold of his
hand when you pray to the Father to aid you; learn of the
works of his beautiful world; love him for his goodness,
and all mankind, because he loves them; and be not anxious
for anything else.' Yes, these were his words. And
have I fulfilled them? To the letter I have tried to be
faithful, but something is wanting. I reap no reward of
self-satisfaction. They speak of the approving conscience.
I know it not. My life is one great feeling of deficiency,
my soul nothing but an altar of sighing and supplication.
Whither shall I turn for light? The Bible&mdash;even Jesus&mdash;have
not their full power over my crude and ignorant mind,
and when I pray, O! that the heavens would divide but a
hair's breadth that I might be sure that God hears me! I
try to follow strictly the precepts of Jesus in my thoughts
and my conduct, but it seems to unfit me for what they
call the best society in which I visit with my teacher,

<!--- vol 1 page 96 -->

and they do and say what seems to me so contrary to his
spirit that I am ever weary and sad. Yet I can say nothing,
for I am but a little girl and know not how to argue, only
to feel, and then, worse than all, this unrest and dissatisfaction
with myself weakens my words when I would dissent
from my companions. O! my mother! my far-away
mother! would that I could be folded in thy arms while I
say 'Our Father!' and then, perhaps, He would answer to
her call and mine. For is it not a cruel thing to tear
the young bird from its warm nest, or the tender lamb from
the sheepfold, to wander in the snow-mountains alone?
and how can it be that a little girl could find the right way
through the cold, hard world, to the warm, sunlighted
heaven above, without her mother to guide her?"</p>

<p>MISS INGEMANN'S heart was a benevolent
one, and her character high-toned, and whenever a child
was placed under her care, she felt the responsibility
involved in the trust reposed in her. Not less did this
feeling influence her, than heretofore, when the little,
dark-browed West-Indian was left to her management and
fostering nurture. To us, Americans, slaveholders, or abettors,
excusers or tolerators of slavery, who are buried ten
thousand fathoms deep under the prejudices, conventionalisms,
false, unnatural and wicked feelings superinduced
upon the soul by the existence among us of this great sin
against God, and foul wrong against his humanity, it seems
almost impossible, that Zo&euml; should not from the first, have
been looked upon by both teacher and pupils with distrust
and aversion, when she came to claim as an equal a share in
the privileges of this "home of education." But it was
not so; on the contrary, she was instituted immediately as
both the lion and the pet of the school. But her nature
was a shrinking one, and she recoiled from the pedestal
upon which, not only Hilda, but all her schoolmates, at
first strove to place her. And who that knows anything of
the world of children, no less than that of men and women,
is not aware that, for immediate success in life, one must
not only accept willingly all the honors it proffers, but claim

<!--- vol 1 page 98 -->

even a little more as its just due, in order to keep a position
fairly equal to its deserts, in an age when might
makes right, and among a people, admirers of coarse,
rough, obvious power. For our modern material civilization
has but little insight into the value, beauty and latent power
of a soul, true to its natural instincts, refined and strengthened
by growing up into a perception of, and sympathy
with God's revelation through the ages, while it is kept tender
and pure, and at the same time, is glorified in intellect,
affections, character and imagination, by a walk and communion
with the Infinite, through Nature, no less than the
spirit, principles, precepts, hopes and promises of his Holy
Son, our Lord and Master, the beginning of a new spiritual
creation, and the Leader through time and eternity of
all who put their trust in him! So that the child was soon
as readily dropped as she desired to be, into quietness and
retirement. It followed, as a natural consequence, that
she ceased also to be the favorite, except with a very few;
for there are not many so true, loyal and self-sustained
that they do not require that their judgment of men and
things should be reflected from the smiles and respect or
haply worship of others, in order to insure them that they
are not making fools of themselves in their opinions or
choice of friends and associates.</p>

<p>But other causes operated with Miss Ingemann, to place
her in unhappy relations with Zo&euml;, to lead her into mistake,
perplexity and discouragement, and at length into injustice
and mutual injury to each other's characters and lives.</p>

<p>In the first place, she was an Anglo-Saxon, with the
physical courage, energy, self-reliance and practical power
of that predominant race. She believed in its "manifest
destiny," which by the majority is supposed to involve a
superiority to the rest of the world, and as a natural inference,
its final rule over the different nations.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; belonged to a different division of the human family.
Her strongest characteristics were a fiery temperament,

<!--- vol 1 page 99 -->

imagination, strong affections and religious aspiration.
With these were combined a nervous organization of the
most delicate cast, warning her at every point, of her want
of sympathy and adaptedness in physical, mental and spiritual
constitution to the sphere into which she had been
transported. By a strong natural instinct, acting upon her
like a fate, she unfolded herself only so far as she could
find a response to her utterances, either in action or words.
As the spider, who, sociably inclined, approaches the domestic
circle, and puts out one antenna after another to
attest its welcome, when lo! a start, or a scream, (if haply
it is not crushed altogether by a rude and daring foot,)
warns it to use its mysterious instinct by feigning death,
until it can scramble away discomfited, and then it compensates
itself by ascending on its self-woven wing to a
height above the scene of its trial, where it spins itself a
world according to the beautiful laws with which its Creator
has inspired it; so Zo&euml;, finding in her teacher's staid,
bare practical world no home for her glowing fancies, unworldly
fashions and aims, and enkindled hopes, sat like a
stone, in the midst of the noisy life and glittering but
chilly brightness about her, and as soon as she might,
buried herself in her chamber to call about her the spirits
of a clearer ether and intenser being.</p>

<p>In the second place, Miss Ingemann was of noble birth
and dated back from a long line of titled ancestors. She believed
in privileged orders, and though intending to be
strictly just in her estimate of her pupils, this idea made the
scale waver a little against those who were not, of which Zo&euml;
was one. Then she had the true Anglo-Saxon mode of
estimating power, as before indicated, in an age of action
and invention; its obvious, clear, striking manifestations
she appreciated, and where this was exhibited in full
blaze, no prejudice in favor of rank or title prevented her
for a moment from owning and bowing down to its sway.
So to the charms of simple goodness as exhibited in ways

<!--- vol 1 page 100 -->

familiar to her, she was fully alive, and was absolute in her
requisitions of its first importance in her friends, associates,
and pupils. But enslaved by conventionalism, ever
fearful of overstepping the bounds of female propriety, as
laid down by society; gifted with but little imagination or
passion, she frowned upon all manifestations of character
which indicated a rebellion against existing opinions and
customs.</p>

<p>With no broad sweep of sympathies which would make
her one with every tribe, nation, and kingdom under
heaven; ay, and lift her to companionship with the realms
above, and carry her in pity and hope into the under-world
beneath, but confining her familiar intercourse very much
to a choice clique of the wise and good, ignorant from
actual witness of the obstacles, disadvantages, and dreadful
temptations through which the multitudes struggle
upwards to the light, or which haply prevent their ascent,
she was often stern and intolerant in her judgment of the
imperfect and erring, or else ignored them altogether.</p>

<p>Not by such narrow rules did he who knew what was in
man gain such insight into his depths, and it may be
doubted whether with the aid of miracle itself, this nature
would have unfolded itself to his gaze, had he separated
himself from the people by virtue of his royal descent and
sought only the companionship of Simon the Pharisee,
and such as he, or even of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus.</p>

<p>But the great, over-mastering cause of her failure in educating
Zo&euml;, was the falsities of her creed; for these she was
but partially accountable, for it was the result of the spirit of
her age, which was compounded in part of Christian ideas,
it is true, but with a large infusion of the errors of the
past, the crude speculations and skepticisms of the present
mingled with the worldliness, licentiousness, and hypocrisy,
ever the attendants of a decline of faith in the simple
but sublime truths of God, written upon the human soul in
its purity, revealed through his messengers and daily

<!--- vol 1 page 101 -->

hung out to the gaze of the world in his wonderful works.
Strange, strange that these verities should be forsaken or
be held but feebly, to cling to a soiled, misshapen, parchment
credendum, scribbled all over with characters written
in blood, partly by the Pagans of the anti-Christian world,
in part by the half-enlightened, self-conceited philosophers
of the times of, and after the Apostles, with the continual
accretion with which mistaken men, loving their own blind
opinions and fancies better than the truth, have covered
over or deformed their majestic beauty.</p>

<p>Had Zo&euml;'s mind and character been like Hilda's, for
instance, ready to be moulded according to her own fixed
notions of culture, all obstructions to a happy development
of her nature, at least to a certain extent, would have been
spared her. For so much greater than any creed is the
human soul that in quiet, unexcited times when the falsehoods
of society, like lions and tigers asleep, scare not
mankind into unnatural attitudes and induce them to build
around themselves ugly walls of defense, and force not the
guardians of society to utter hideous shrieks and magnify
the danger at hand, thereby frightening it into deformity, it
may grow beautifully under the genial light of God's sunshine
and grace, though it may not reach the height,
breadth, and depth of expansion that it would under the
most favorable circumstances. But the Anglo-African was
a new specimen, a <i>lusus natur&aelig;</i> of humanity, and her
teacher knew not what to make of her. Her sense of responsibility
nullified all feeling of curiosity, all desire for
entertainment in the exhibition of a nature so different
from her own, and her love of sway and fixed ideas of the
culture suited to all human beings alike kept her on the
alert to check any of her eccentric demonstrations. Her
want of success in calling forth her powers at first bewildered,
next discouraged, then disgusted her, and year
after year she treated her with increasing coldness and
dignity. These different feelings she expressed to her

<!--- vol 1 page 102 -->

friends and associates, with a few of whom Zo&euml; was a
favorite and who saw in her more than appeared to Miss
Ingemann's prejudiced eye. These took up her defense
warmly, and by injudicious comments in favor of one and
against the other, enlarged the breach between them.
Then came to her mind the false philosophy which she
had somewhere read of, that the Africans were a race
cursed by God in early times for the unnatural scoffing of
a son at his patriarch father. Next, clustered around it
the infidel notions that its degradation was insurmountable;
that God intended it for the lowest rank among his people,
and mercifully denied it the Caucasian powers; and as
these opinions were warmly combated by the majority of
her acquaintances, resentment was awakened which recoiled
on her pupil and darkened her to her mental vision
more and more, till she became utterly incapacitated from
judging her in any point correctly. This result Zo&euml;, with
her almost supernatural perceptions, felt in its full force,
and it threw her more and more back upon her vivid imagination
and burning sentiments. It remains to be seen
what was the natural effect of this concentration upon
herself.</p>

<p>Not that she <i>knew distinctly</i> of these speculations, for
they were not repeated to her by any one, and if she had
ever had a clear consciousness of her distinction of race
before she left home, which is doubtful, it had faded from
her mind as her soliloquizing about her mother has indicated.
Her differences of person from the other girls she
attributed to a West-India climate, as also her love for the
hot summer sun and aversion to the winter's snow and
cold. She knew only too well that Miss Ingemann disliked
her, and that she was hurt and offended that she could not
make her what she wished, yet she was sensible of no willful
opposition to her desires and efforts. She studied hard
the lessons given her, and seldom dissented from her
wishes ostensibly. But there was the perpetual cry of

<!--- vol 1 page 103 -->

resistance of her nature within to many of the tasks imposed
upon her which would not be appeased. She would
rush from her abstract studies into the open air of the
garden, which surrounded the house, and clasp the trees
with her arms as if they were conscious, sympathizing
friends who would rescue her from her thraldom. She
would throw herself upon the ground by the flower-beds, and
brood over the lilies and violets, for she seldom gathered
them, and say, "O, my beautiful angels! they need not
say that ye are without life like me, for I feel it in every
breath of your fragrance. Ye tell me in that, that ye are
sorry for my woe, for Ah, my sweet flowers! ye know well
that they are not kind to the little dark-girl as to you; for
here in God's beautiful sunshine ye may ever dwell, and
be wet by his dew, and sprinkled by his showers and bloom,
O, so beautifully in the light of his smile, while I am
chained to dark, bewildering words, and mystic crooked
characters in the prison-house of my soul's bondage with
the fear of frowns and sneers, if I do not love them and
make them my own. But O! lily, queen of my heart!
they speak not to me as thou dost, when I ask them
whence, why am I and what does our Father wish me to
do. Thy voice even is not clear to me yet in answer to
my ceaseless request; but it may be that when I have more
and better studied his holy Word, my mind will be pure
and still enough to hear distinctly your revealings. So
bloom on, my lily and violet, and when your leaves fall and
mingle with the dust, and your breaths ascend to heaven to
take to themselves more glorious and lovely representations
of God's beauty and love, O, then plead with Him when ye
are blooming at the foot of his great white throne, to tell
me more plainly when, where and how I am to do his holy
will! Farewell, my flowers, until I have wrought out my
tasks, and then I will come again and seek my reward in
the odor of your incense, and the radiance of your sheen."

<!--- vol 1 page 104 -->

<p>In going in she met Miss Ingemann: "Miss Zo&euml;," said
she, "these are school hours, you are aware?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"You know the rule, it is not necessary to repeat it to
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>The lady walks up the steps with great dignity, while
Zo&euml; goes to the schoolroom and takes her Algebra.</p>

<p>"It may be breaking the rules to the letter to go and
talk to the flowers between nine and twelve in the forenoon,
but at any rate my head is clearer and courage greater
than before I went out, so my lessons will not suffer by
it. Come here, you dingy Arab of an arithmetic; I wonder
if your old grandfather far removed, who made you, and
who is, I hope, in heaven, is not sorry that he left you behind
him, to puzzle and fret so many little girls. I wonder
if Jesus studied algebra! I doubt it. Then I don't know
why I should. But come along, I say; we have got other
masters now-a-days. But you don't get me to go astray
from him, in what I <i>know</i> he did or did not."</p>

<p>"ZO&Euml;! there is the music teacher, dear; have you practised
your lesson enough to be familiar with it, for you know
how cross he is when we are at fault?" said Hilda, who
partly from her love to her friend and dread of her incurring
censure, and in part, from her inherent spirit of
management, which, train it as she would, still floated on
the surface of her character, though the principle upon
which it rested, had had its roots dislodged, kept an eye
upon her friend's doings.</p>

<p>"After a fashion; though tum-ti-tum, diddle-de-dee,
don't, you well know, belong to me, so I give it but little
welcome, seeing that I shall drive it from my soul's door as

<p>and she balanced her music sheet on its tip, and thus
walked out of the room,</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 106 -->

<p class="small">(<i>Hilda alone</i>.)</p>

<p>"The funny, mournful, foolish, wise little <i>thing</i>; yes,
<i>thing!</i> for I really do not know what else to call my precious,
provoking, fascinating, fantastic, but dear, dear
friend. I wonder what fairy left such a little elfish, yet
cherub changeling in this naughty, prosy world. She is
so different from us all in her way, speech, looks and
everything. Sometimes she is so weird, that I am afraid
of her; and then again, no angel from the skies could
look or talk more beautifully. One would think, to hear
her speak of Jesus, that she had lived when he did, and
he had been her schoolmate as I am, and that walking to
and fro, they had led each other by the hand, and spoken
in the most serious, but familiar way of their love for God
and their fellow-men, and of the great and good deeds
they would do for them. And then again, she so revolts
against her life here and her lessons and work&mdash;not in
word ever to Miss Ingemann, but by her listlessness and
indifference that I am out of patience and in fear for her.
For our teacher dislikes her, that is evident; and Zo&euml;
knows it, and that makes her more and more like a stone,
when in her presence. Miss Ingemann never sees her as
I do, sometimes full of fire and fancy, sometimes, O, so
tender and loving to me, and then again, so mournful and
sad, and next hour so angelic and devout, that I look upwards
to see if Heaven is not opening to receive her. And
yet, I well know, that she tells me but very few of her
feelings of any kind, for I am so unlike her, I could not
understand them, but I know her better than any one, for
I sometimes catch sentences of her soliloquies, and they
make me wonder and tremble for her too. What more can
I do for her than I do? I try to explain, and explain matters
between her and our teacher, but it is of no use.
Miss Ingemann will persist in seeing only her surface-mind
and character, which do not suit her. And Zo&euml; is
under a spell, I verily believe, for I can think of nothing

<!--- vol 1 page 107 -->

but a dead wall when she is in her presence, which, of
course, is rather an incumbrance in a house full of bright,
lively people. O me! I could be so happy, if the world
did not go so badly with poor Zo&euml;! My heart is as light
as a feather, when I have not her lying upon it with her
griefs and wrongs. Why can't people be happy, I wonder?
I see no reason for discontent.</p>

<p>And she waltzed out of the room.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; practised her quadrille in the presence of her master,
a common-place mind, who played with great execution
the music of the reputed masters of song, whose
deeper spirit was nevertheless beyond his ken. He was
constantly dissatisfied that his pupil did not <i>finger</i> her piano
with more agility and force, but could appreciate but very
feebly the occasional bursts of melody which in the
simplest manner would gush from her at times, when the
clouds would momentarily roll away from her spirit, revealing
the glory behind. Still less was he pleased when, with
disgust in her soul at the present hour, which encircled her
in its folds of servile propriety, with glimpses of a future
far in the distance, dazzling to her vision by its splendor
and beatification, but shaded for the most part to her prophetic
eye by she knew not what big mountains of difficulty,
tipped with sunlight, or valleys thousands of feet
deep, into which, however, the glory of heaven shone, except
into one dark mass of vapor inscrutable to her gaze,
she gave vent to all that was in her in language and tone
appropriate to her feelings much more than to poetic rules.
She was sure never to do this when he was by, but this
day he lingered in the hall for some trifling purpose, and
heard her outpourings:</p>

"Good-by t'ye, master! Are ye?<br/>

Yea, of my finger-tips alone,<br/>

Nay not of those, for here I wash ye,<br/>

My digits, and here is all your own.</p>

<p>(<i>She dips her hands into a glass of water,

window towards his usual path of egress</i>.)</p>

Soaked of its individual colors;</p>

<p>"Battered and squeezed, and shaped and

Brilliant as the day-star, and tender as the gloaming,<br/>

True as is the Word of God, wise without measurement,<br/>

Holy as the angels are! with Him I made a sacrament;</p>

<p>"Ere my soul to this earth from yon heaven descended,<br/>

When walking with Him in its fields of perennial green,<br/>

With the sunlit sky o'erhead all bright with gold and azure,<br/>

And its glory slightly vailed by clouds of silvery sheen;</p>

<p>"He told in simple words the pure truth of his commandments,<br/>

Unvailed of all invention, false glare and grim denouncings,<br/>

Their true spirit he revealed to me beneath all wordy seemings,<br/>

And set my heart on fire with the love of their perfection.</p>

<p>"I saw him face to face, their glorious embodiment.<br/>

Perfect love and truth and beauty all radiant in him shone,<br/>

As I gazed entranced and wondering, half fearful and amazed<br/>

He smiled upon me then, and laid his hand upon my head.</p>

<p>"I remember no words, for my being was in its infancy,<br/>

But his smile is in my heart as it fell upon me then;<br/>

His hand upon my head has shaped my brow to reverence.<br/>

His voice within my soul has never ceased to echo.</p>

<p>"O, glorious elder brother! for such you seem to me,<br/>

Impatient and doubting I turn my heart to thee;<br/>

Intercede before our Father, whose beloved Son thou art,<br/>

That He may aid me to know and do faithfully my part.</p>

<p>"In this life, so cold and dreary, where heaven's light but dimly
shines,<br/>

Heaven's love that comes through men is so little of it mine;<br/>

O, when will the day come so longed for by me,<br/>

When with my dearest mother sitting under the tamarind tree,</p>

<p>"We can talk of thy perfection? a ray to us from God,<br/>

All love and mercy art thou, without the cruel rod.<br/>

We will pray to Him through thee, He will listen to our cries,<br/>

<p>While thus reveling in her own fancies, making the
piano obedient to the impulses which prompted her enthusiastic
soul, outraged, as she felt it to be, in its forced
expression no less than its stinted aspirations; at one moment
making it speak in grinding, explosive, and indignant
tones, then joining her voice to it in strains full, rich, and
harmonious, while she gave vent to her religious yearnings,
followed by a song, the accompaniment to which was full
of sparkling, even rollicking humor, and that by another still

<!--- vol 1 page 111 -->

of most mournful and thrilling melody, Miss Ingemann
entered the room. She had just listened to the piqued
music-master's complaint of her reference to himself, which
he partly heard, and while nearing the door the outburst of
fun and frolic fell upon her ear; but called away for a moment,
she lost the pathos which ended her outpourings,
which might, perhaps, have touched her. She was dignified
and indignant.</p>

<p>"Miss Zo&euml;," she said, "you hinder your progress very
much by indulging in such outbursts. I hope you will not
again. I regret to hear from your teacher that you seem
to have come to a pause in the acquisition of this delightful
and most ladylike accomplishment. I advise you to
put a check upon your crude, disrespectful (and here she
erected her head while her lip expressed the scorn she
felt at what she deemed low taste), and I must say, vulgar
fancies, and be more obedient in spirit as well as letter to
the dictation of your teachers."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; was hushed, both soul and body, by this cold and
unsympathizing reproof.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, as the lady went out and closed the
door, "it is all true. I am to-be-sure very stupid not to
find more than I do in these great performances, and very
lazy, I suppose, ever to miss a note in my lesson. It is
strange when Miss Ingemann, who is so high-toned and
learned, and who is incapable of pretense, goes into ecstasies
when she hears Beethoven and Wagner and Hayden
and Mozart, that I cannot. It is because I do not appreciate
them of course, and besides I am very discontented and
wicked. Not but what they move me. O yes! yes indeed,
they are pure and high, intellectual and aspiring, and I
bless them for many an hour of forgetfulness of myself
and for carrying me up to the stars' clear light, to the
Great Spirit above, and into the world of nature all around
me, (spreading her hands and raising her eyes in ecstasy.
She pauses and leans her forehead on both hands, then

<!--- vol 1 page 112 -->

raises it with an altered expression). But you can't cheat
this dark child anyway, though I am like the ace of spades,
somewhat faded out. It is all good enough for white
people, but why won't they allow that I can be different
and crave something which I have never heard. (She
rises). Was I not born in the burning tropics, where the
sun shines all the year with fervor as well as light, and
down deep in my soul there is a thirst which no water of
earth has yet slaked, and in my brain is a flame which
perpetually burns, writhing like a serpent after the stream
that would quench it; and in my heart, O my poor heart!
a loud cry rending me for the love that would lull it to
sleep as the mother hushes her infant upon her breast,
and through my whole being is the perpetual hungering
and agonizing after God! God! Who? what am I, and
what wouldst thou have me to do? O! show me the way
of thy appointing!</p>

<p>"But I must go. Let me breathe the air of the outer-world,
and would that it were not impregnated with the
dust and smoke which somehow seem to envelop my
friends when they would do me the most good! Heigh-ho!
This is the world and the other is the country, as Hilda
says when she is particularly serious, and I believe it; but
I have a feeling that I never shall go there; for if I am as
faulty as Miss Ingemann thinks me, I don't deserve to, and
somehow I shrink from ever being in that part where such
stiff, dignified, cold people as she and some of her friends
are. I am afraid of them here and I must be more so when
my soul is laid bare and they see what a discontented,
fretful creature I am. I don't feel half so afraid of our
Father as I am of them, but he says if we don't love our
brother, which means everybody, we don't love Him; so I
don't know about the future; I am puzzled and very
anxious&mdash;O, dear! I'll try and not think about it."</p>

<p>Thus unhappy and dissatisfied with herself and her outward
relations, she rushed eagerly within, where in her

<!--- vol 1 page 113 -->

dream-world there was no self-contention or reproach from
others. The ruling qualities of her mind, being misunderstood
and thus left without guidance by those older and
more judicious than herself, ran to waste, and overleaping
their just boundaries, and rioting unlicensed, weakened
and injured her other powers and hindered their healthy
and happy action. Such mistakes in education, will continually
occur, until human nature is seen and felt to be
the great and sacred thing it is; and while on the one
hand, all human means and appliances are brought to bear
upon its development; on the other, a large margin of freedom
is left that it may work naturally and easily in its
Heaven-appointed sphere, directed and guided by the
subtle influences of his spirit no less than by his written
Scripture and his indicated will, as daily seen and heard
in the events and experiences of life, in the suggestions of
our friends, both the older and the younger, the history of
the past and the present, as well as in the changing phenomena
of nature, every one of which is a sign proceeding
directly from the Infinite mind.</p>

<p>BENEDICK. "What, my dear lady Disdain, are you yet living?"</p>

<p>SHAKSPEARE.</p>

<br/>

</div>

<p>ONE bright morning, Mrs. K&ouml;rner walked into the
study of Mr. Liebenhoff, her brother-in-law, the Lutheran
minister, where she found him preparing his next Sunday's
sermon. Her sister, also, with portfolio in hand, was
scribbling at a rapid rate, while several sheets of copy
were piled up before her.</p>

<p>"What a long letter you are writing, Lisbet! Who is
to be favored with such an elaborate epistle?"</p>

<p>"No less a personage than the public, Lina, if it will
receive it. I have been intending to tell you that I was
turning authoress, but really secrets are such troublesome
things to keep, that I did not like to burden you with
mine."</p>

<p>"Why have any great privacy about it?" said Mr. Liebenhoff.
"I'm tired of secrets; there is sure to be falsehood
growing out of them. They are confided to two or
three or more, intimate friends, and from them they are
sure to spread, and then comes the questioning and cross-questioning
inflicted upon such simple-minded individuals
as I am for instance, by one and another of your sex, and
it is more than I can stand under; and I am determined to
have nothing to do with them any more. My dear, do be
frank, and put your own name to your book."</p>

<p>The two ladies looked at each other and smiled, for they

<!--- vol 1 page 115 -->

were reminded of some precious little confidences of their
own, which they had shared with him, under promises of
his everlasting silence, but failing to make him feel their
importance and awful magnitude as viewed by themselves,
he had repeatedly shocked and discomfited them, by bringing
them into conversation at exactly the most unpropitious
time, as mere matters of course. They were never able
to convince him that these denouements were of the least
consequence, excepting as it hurt and sometimes offended
them, but as he was very sensitive to their reproofs, he had
got to have a nervous dread of anything which squinted in
the least towards secrecy; therefore his remark.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall; I have not quite made up my mind
upon the subject, but at least, until I have nearly completed
it, I prefer that my friends should not know it, for quietness
is so necessary to the free and propitious working of
my mind, that I do not wish it broken in upon by the curiosity
or observations of any one."</p>

<p>"I am very glad you are writing and I doubt not that
you will be successful. What is the title of your Tale, for
that I suppose it is?" said her sister.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I shall call it 'The Way.' It is to deal with
an interesting question of the day, the subject of tyranny;
and as you know it is a law of my nature and development
to view everything in the light of Religion, it will take its
principal tone from that. To the young at least, I hope it
will be acceptable, and I shall try to make it as entertaining
to them as I can. You shall see extracts from it when you
are at leisure, if you would like to."</p>

<p>"Thank you, very gladly; but this morning I have run
in for a moment, to invite you both to tea. Mrs. Pendleton,
the newly-arrived American minister's wife, with her
two young lady friends, Miss Hale and Miss Ingalls, are
going to be with us, and I want you to come and talk English
with them. They know nothing of Danish or German,
and only have an imperfect smattering of French.

<!--- vol 1 page 116 -->

What is the reason I wonder, that they come so poorly furnished
with the necessary requisition to a comfortable life
among us? It is well that you, thanks to your facility in
acquiring languages, and that I through my intimacy with
Mrs. Stephenson, and my acquaintance with Mr. Phillips,
can communicate with them in their mother tongue, as it
is all in all to them. Will you come?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, we shall be most happy to do so; shall we
not, dear?" turning to her husband.</p>

<p>"O yes, thank you, Lina. Who else is going to be with
you?" said he.</p>

<p>"O, Miss Dahl and Miss Holberg, and the usual set you
know, and Miss Ingemann, I suppose, though I must say
that I am rather out of conceit with her, for I really think
she treats poor Zo&euml; Carlan very shabbily, who is a great
favorite of mine. I can see that her own character is deteriorating
in consequence of her prejudice against her.
She is not so successful in her education as with her other
pupils, so she dislikes her. I used to think her a model
of a high-toned lady, but I have seen her unjust and unladylike
in spirit, and even in manner towards the poor
child, which has lowered her in my opinion very much."</p>

<p>"I must know Zo&euml; better. I feel more and more interested
in her every time I meet her. She has been so
retiring, and I have so many demands upon my time, that
I have neglected to get into familiar relations with her;
but I see she does not look happy. I will send for her to-morrow,
and try and win her affections and confidence,"
said Mrs. Liebenhoff.</p>

<p>"Do, dear," said her husband, "I know she will suit
you. She has great delicacy of organization it seems to
me, and needs some kind, strong friend to lean upon. She
keeps aloof from me very much, and I know her better
through Hilda, than in any other way. She is her oracle,
and has I think, a favorable effect upon my Undine. I
hope she will breathe a more quiet, reflective soul into that

<!--- vol 1 page 117 -->

wild water-sprite. Do you think, I was walking in the
glen yesterday, and I heard a tinkling laugh, and who
should have waded into the middle of the brook but she;
and there she was dashing water all over herself, without the
slightest regard to drenching her garments, and when she
saw me, instead of running to hide herself and her dripping
habiliments, she filled the shell which she held in her
hand with water, and threw it towards me. She is as innocent
as a child of five years old, instead of being a
young lady past seventeen, but she certainly needs a good
deal of taming."</p>

<p>"She is Miss Ingemann's pet, and presumes more upon
her indulgence than any of the other pupils," said Mrs.
K&ouml;rner; "and she <i>is</i> a most enticing creature, I don't
wonder she is fond of her."</p>

<p>"She will make smashing work among the beaux, when
she comes out into life, but really she ought to have more
check put upon her manners," said Mr. Liebenhoff.</p>

<p>The evening came, and with it Mrs. K&ouml;rner's guests, Mr.
and Mrs. Pendleton, Miss Ingalls, and Miss Hale, all fair
specimens of American citizens, who dwell in, and hold
a prominent position in New England villages of the highest
class.</p>

<p>Mrs. Liebenhoff was the first comer.</p>

<p>"Lina, what sort of people are these Americans? Are
they Goths and Vandals, dressed up in magnified French
style, without the tact which would tell them when and
where not to load on their finery; with great pretensions
and many vulgar short comings, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O no, not so, I will assure you. You will like them
because you are accustomed to mingle with all sorts of
people, and appreciate nature and spirit. Besides, they
have real cultivation. Perhaps they are not as classic and
<i>mellow</i>, if I may use the word, as those born and bred in
an old country, where every baby that comes into the world
has impressed upon its soul enough of the history of its

<!--- vol 1 page 118 -->

past, to save it from the sharp angles, which inevitably stick
out more or less from the characters and minds of the inhabitants
of a new land, where the first thing the wee
things have to do when they can walk and look about them,
is to fell a forest, build a log hut, settle its religious forms,
laws, literature and art. What can you expect but that
they should be prematurely shrewd and knowing, and
forceful, and lack a little some of the graces of life? You
will enjoy them, for you resemble them. Somehow you
have found out the secret of being mighty universal in
your sympathies, Lisbet. I have been ready to think at
times that you lagged behind in your private ones, but only
let the time of need come, and I find that your heart is in
the right place."</p>

<p>The guests entered and were soon made to feel at home,
by Mrs. K&ouml;rner's cordial, bright manner and abounding
hospitality.</p>

<p>"Have you got settled at housekeeping, Mrs. Pendleton?"
said she.</p>

<p>"Yes, pretty well. Of course I have not gathered about
me all the comforts of my own home. That I should not
expect so soon."</p>

<p>"No, my friend, and don't look at all for that consummation,"
said Theresa Ingalls. "Cooks like Sally and waiters
like Richard, ready to run to the ends of the earth for you
five times a day, and concoct all imaginable delicacies at
your artistic suggestion, do not grow on every bush, much
less here in this Lilliput," said she aside to her friend,
as Mrs. K&ouml;rner ran to lift up her youngest who had fallen
upon his face.</p>

<p>"Don't, Theresa, get into hot water with these Danes
the first thing, by your criticisms. Do smooth over matters
a little, and what you can't, with truth, why, let it go and
say nothing," said Jenny Hale, laughing a little, but at the
same time looking somewhat anxious for the next remark
Theresa would make.</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 119 -->

<p>"Why, what now! Is that so very awful! Well, (drawing
down her mouth) will that do?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pendleton and Mr. K&ouml;rner entered. Mrs. Liebenhoff
drew her chair near the former&mdash;a thoughtful looking
man, quite a contrast in person to his brilliant wife, rather
absent in manner, but when roused from his own thoughts,
his face lighted up with sympathy and interest, and he bore
in a very quiet but just and sensible way his part in the
conversation.</p>

<p>"I have been reading Emerson's Essays to-day," said
she; "do you know your distinguished countryman?"</p>

<p>"Not much, personally; but we all know of him of
course. He has lectured for us and we always like to
hear him."</p>

<p>"He has much insight into life, I think; is a true interpreter
of nature from his point of view, and is a pure,
high-toned moralist. You have great reason to be congratulated
for the possession of such a mind in your new
country."</p>

<p>"Yes; I don't understand all he writes, but I think he
is more practical as he grows older, or at any rate his mind
adapts itself to the wants of the times very well. When
we incline to run too much into the vein of a material
philosophy, he is what we call transcendental; he sits apart
and utters his oracles which seem nonsense to some, and
infidelity to others, and the distilled truth of the gods to the
initiated. When we grow corrupt in our councils and high
moral truths need to be sounded abroad, then he is found
at his post, and no one is listened to by the more advanced
portion of our people with greater interest than himself. I
sometimes think he may be a specimen, or rather an indication
of a higher order of beings, which may in future
exist among us, but I don't know."</p>

<p>"The fault which I find with him is," said she, "that
from being so much imbued with classic lore, he is Grecian
in the working of his intellect, and the expression of his

<!--- vol 1 page 120 -->

feelings, more than Hebrew or rather Christian, which is
synonymous with universal. Taking that point of departure
more than the New Testament, or at least keeping it
in sight too much, not seeing with sufficient clearness that
the principles of all literature, science, art, and life culminated
in Jesus, that he is the central sun from which is to
radiate light, heat and inspiration by which the past is
to be truly and satisfactorily read, the present interpreted
and guided, and the future gazed into with clearness of
vision and brightness of hope, he loses the proper perspective
of truth and speaks of the Vedas, Zoroaster, Confucius,
and Socrates too much as if they were on a level
with our glorified Master and his concentrated, complete,
and unadulterated truth."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so. He is in a condition of reaction from
Calvinistic superstition, which, perhaps you do not know,
stalks about in its grimmest and most unnatural guise in
my country, and one of its saddest effects is the warping
of our most free and truth-loving minds too far in the
direction of a cold rationalism. But Emerson is essentially
Christian after all. The Puritan parson was born in him,
and he can't help looking like one, and his mind is so fair
and his judgment so calm that if a higher truth were presented
to him with clearness and simplicity, he would
accept it gladly."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I would have him utter with manly, fervent,
inspiring tones his convictions of the sublime verities of the
Christian faith, and his eternal obligation to its inspired
Revealer; for it is by going back to first principles, by ever
renewing our first love, by confessing from time to time
our first faith in our Adorable Leader by word, act, symbol,
and ceremony as well as life, that we keep him in sight in
our way through the world, or can hope to be united to
him in our triumphal march through the eternal ages."</p>

<p>Mrs. Liebenhoff and Mr. Pendleton were sitting aside
during this conversation, and as it paused they heard Mrs.

<!--- vol 1 page 121 -->

K&ouml;rner say, "Well, it is of no use waiting longer for the
gentlemen, I will have tea brought in. Young ladies, I
was mindful in giving my invitation to you of your proper
accompaniments, but they are delinquent, you perceive,
which I am sorry to say is not unfrequently the case in these
faltering times. Our knights are getting to be rather unreliable
in social life; the claims of business, and if the
truth must be told, the coarser pleasures which exclude us,
are so peremptory."</p>

<p>"It is what we are used to," said Theresa, "in New
England. In the first place, our beaux are not to be
depended upon very much; and in the second place, there
are next to none left to us poor widowed maidens, for they
emigrate to California or the western States, as soon as we
begin to have some hopes of them, and the few that remain
wrap themselves up in selfish old bachelorhood, which is
more hopeless, you know, than all the rest."</p>

<p>"I am surprised," said Mrs. Liebenhoff; "I supposed
that young people in pairs, twin souls, as the cant of the
day is, designated for each other by heaven from birth,
were the natural products of your virgin soil, and that you
were free from the wicked, unnatural conventionalisms
which divide such or haply prevent their coming together
at all in our country."</p>

<p>"You are greatly mistaken, madam, if you think we are
thus unsophisticated," said Miss Hale; "we are getting to
be apt imitators of Europeans in this regard. Our young
gents and ladies, too, are very old in the ways of the world,
I can assure you."</p>

<p>"Should you like a rapid sketch of our young American
gentleman of the present day?" said Theresa.</p>

<p>"Nothing better," said Mrs. K&ouml;rner; "pray give
us one."</p>

<p>"Well, in the first place, we have a few who correspond
to the heroes of which we read in romance, the Knights

<!--- vol 1 page 122 -->

Templars, Crusaders, 'les preux chevaliers' of past times,
high-toned, enthusiastic, religious, who go to work in a very
sensible, earnest way to do their duty in every respect, and
some of my friends are lucky enough to have drawn such
into their nets; but they are rare specimens, and (sighing)
this individual, for one, has but little hope left of such
success, lay as many snares as she will. Running into this
class and still unlike it&mdash;one hardly knows where the one
ends and the other begins, and yet there is a great difference&mdash;are
the Worthies."</p>

<p>"The what?" said Mrs. Liebenhoff.</p>

<p>"The provokingly worthy class, who are more trying
than any other; for you cannot help it, and they really
deserve scolding at, and yet they are just good enough to
give one compunctious visitings for saying a word against
them. They rise early in the morning, say their prayers,
I have not the least doubt, eat a temperate breakfast, go to
their business like clock-work, never make a mistake in
life or manners, can be trusted with untold treasures in
any shape or form, are very agreeable, gentlemanly, intelligent
companions when they vouchsafe their presence in
our midst, but dear me! any machines could be made to do
as much, you know. What they want is life, moral enthusiasm,
and what is to our purpose especially&mdash;devotion to
us. You understand?"</p>

<p>"That is what I complain of in some of my gentlemen
friends," said Mrs. K&ouml;rner.</p>

<p>"Do <i>they</i> take young ladies to ride and skulk out of
town through the back streets, lest they should be suspected
of some tender designs upon them before they are sure of
success?" said Jenny, "and hover round them, weighing
every look and word to see if it will do to risk an offer;
and when impatient at such timidity, and disgusted at such
want of valor, our faces express the feeling that cannot
but be roused&mdash;'well, if you are so cool and calculating

<!--- vol 1 page 123 -->

as all that, a fig for such love. I can live without you,'
why, forsooth, they scramble away like frightened sheep,
and we see them no more; but go on, Theresa."</p>

<p>"In the third place, there are 'the young elect, who
have got beyond ritual,' who are too far advanced to value
the Bible <i>much</i>, too enlightened for the church, (having
supped that orange, as one of their number profanely said,)
but cry aloud and spare not in literary clubs, anti-slavery,
odd-fellow, free discussion and temperance societies, are
the special champions and abettors of the emancipated
ladies; and in short, thrust a finger into every reform pie
that the public concoct. Are you tired?"</p>

<p>"O no, go on," said two or three voices.</p>

<p>"The fourth class are what I call the Kilkenny cats, an
animal which eats itself up you know, all but a slender
extremity. These are the refined, introverted sort, devoured
by their own selfish sentiments, who might, if they
were not foolish and criminal too&mdash;excuse me, ladies&mdash;gild
our hard-working life with a beautiful radiance. But
no, Narcissus-like, they fall in love with themselves, and
their conversation is interlarded accordingly with every
egotistical letter of the alphabet. These <i>worship</i> in the
woods, poetize in a weakly way, have interesting fits of
absent-mindedness, affect a few high-strung authors and
fewer friends, paint pictures sans soul, sans life, sans fitness
for anything but a chimney board, are musical in a
slender, hypercritical style, fall in love in a dilettante way,
with some different fair one every summer's vacation, and,
in short, with talents and acquirements which they use just
enough to make you regret that they have any to cover
thus with a bushel, are nobody, nowhere, and nothing
at all. O! deliver me from such hangers-on upon the skirts
of our modern society, who will sit by with microscope in
hand, while the faithful are wearing themselves out with
labor and undue responsibility, making their infinitesimal
and impertinent criticisms upon results the fruit of almost

<!--- vol 1 page 124 -->

superhuman efforts, sighing and tears, crucifiers of their
Lord in kid gloves and patent leather boots; first, by denying
him practically, by their paltry lives; secondly, by depreciating
his greatness and perfect excellence in their crude
speculations; thirdly, by lazily feasting upon the bounties
of Providence, without working with their might for the
coming of his glorified kingdom; and fourthly, by standing
aloof from, if not throwing a heavy additional weight upon
the shoulders of his ministers, who would welcome even
the lifting of their little finger to cheer on the building up
anew of his church on the earth! Verily, the times are
out of joint, when such are the caressed, admired and
gazed-up to as the geniuses and seers of this nineteenth
century. Again, I say, deliver me from their deadening
companionship."</p>

<p>"Bravo!" said Mrs. Liebenhoff; "are there any more
specimens? Give them to us, please."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is young America <i>par excellence</i>, Sam, as
we call him now-a-days, often rude, extravagant, ostentatious,
impulsive, but generous, bold, energetic, chivalrous,
romantic, very faulty, sometimes very wicked, but with
great capabilities. I intend to marry one of these, if I
can't get one of the very best of the first class, and indeed,
I think I prefer them any way, they are so spontaneous.
But dear me, as I have not been brought up in the woods,
and don't intend to build my hut there and abide, what a
wearisome working and smoothing over of, and taming of
his greenness and bearishness&mdash;and what is worse often, of
his heathenism there must be before he is presentable in
civilized life! O, pity us poor damsels, ye matrons, who
have anchored in the haven of happy wifehood! I really
wish I was married, so as to have the state, condition, or
whatever you please to call it, together with mankind
generally, and each one in particular, entirely off my mind.
I am sick of the whole genus."</p>

<p>Here she was interrupted by a laugh from Mr. K&ouml;rner.</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 125 -->

<p>"A most effectual way of getting rid of them, surely.
I will try and assist you in this laudable attempt to ignore
our sex. You must be married certainly, confound the
beaux! What do they mean by letting you come off over
the waters without securing you; I am ashamed of them.
Well, we have some here that I will introduce you to."</p>

<p>"My dear sir, I hope you will not think that I left only
dry eyes and composed hearts, when I withdrew the light
of my countenance from my country. I would not tell
tales for the world, but, ahe-m&mdash;There comes Mrs. Pendleton
to the rescue of the young men. I saw her looking
over here, while I was talking with Mrs. Liebenhoff, and
I knew that she was getting ready for an onslaught
upon me."</p>

<p>At that moment Miss Ingemann and other ladies entered
the room, and after the introduction, Mrs. Pendleton crossed
over to where Theresa was sitting.</p>

<p>"Now, ladies, I beg you not to believe everything which
this satirical young friend of mine has said about our
American gentlemen. I know a great many of them
well."</p>

<p>"Excuse me for interrupting you," said Miss Hale, "but
Mrs. Pendleton is not a disinterested umpire between us,
for, as you perceive, she is so fascinating as to withdraw
the attentions which should be rightly ours (being in most
need of them) to herself. <i>She</i> has nothing to complain of,
while we are set aside just enough to make us <i>cool</i> and
impartial judges. I would not insinuate any conscious
treachery, but she and her house and garden have such a
hospitable, <i>taking</i> way with them as quite to eclipse any
humble pretensions of our own."</p>

<p>"Now is not that ungrateful," said Mrs. Pendleton,
"when my aims and efforts in placing myself, my house,
and last, but by no means least, my studious husband and
quiet-loving daughter at your disposal so much, is just
to advance your interests and happiness. Shame on you!

<!--- vol 1 page 126 -->

And now I will tell the whole truth as a proper retribution
for such thanklessness."</p>

<p>"May I be resigned," said Theresa, casting up her eyes,
"for I know well that there is no mercy to be expected
from you, when your war-horse snuffs the battle from
afar."</p>

<p>"Now," said Mrs. Pendleton, "for all moral, religious,
selfishly sentimental delinquencies, and I own that they
have a plenty, I am not going to offer any excuse, for if
people have the New Testament, with its faultless precepts
and perfect example, that is sufficient; there is no reason
that they should be shipwrecked upon these sands. But so
far as their want of gallantry and devotion to the sex is
concerned, there is some excuse, on account of <i>their</i> short-comings
in character and mistakes of education. The
fault of the present day, with our best women, is, that the
intellect is cultivated unduly at the expense of the health,
practical ability, and tenderness, grace and beauty of character.
In short, we have sharpened understandings, instead
of beautiful, loving souls; acute critics in place of
sweet <i>Charities</i>, striving with their soft mantles to cover the
deformities they cannot remove; eager, squinting speculatists,
instead of the strong-eyed <i>Faiths</i>, who pierce the
heavens and become inspired at the visions that dawn on
them as they gaze; fierce satirists, and confident denunciators
and not the bright, beaming, inspiring <i>Hopes</i>, that ever
smile and point upwards, through the thickest gloom and
discouragements. Now, you young ladies, must be less
like the heathen goddesses, somewhat faded and pass&eacute; and
more like the Celestials of our Master's spiritual dispensation
before your age of triumph begins. You must quaff the
elixir of life from the well which he opens for every one
who desires it, and then you will not be growing old at
twenty, complaining that the illusions of life are vanishing,
leaving nothing but a void; that the bloom is rubbed off
from the peach, and that life is exhausted of its sweetness

<!--- vol 1 page 127 -->

and exhilaration, but it will never cease to be full, rich and
harmonious and will irradiate your whole inward and outward
being, and then you will have no lack of adorers."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Pendleton, that is all very fine; but I ask you the
plain question, if we are not now too good for any young
gentlemen&mdash;of our village, for instance? Don't ask us to
get any farther in advance of them. They would lose
sight of us altogether."</p>

<p>"No, not if you advance in the right way, rising into the
ether like Beatrice, but ever casting a gentle, holy, winning
glance behind. Her influence drew her lover upward,
higher and ever higher, and so should yours. As it is, I
grant you excite admiration at a distance; but, dear me!
you have so much more the spirit of carping and ridicule
than of love and forbearance, and generous appreciation
of the inner spirit of humanity, when divested of some of
the ornaments of life, that the men are afraid of you, and
no wonder! I am, too. I am always on the look out for
some prick of your stiletto-intellect, sharpened by everlasting
reading and study of modern literature, and German
philosophy and mathematics, to the exclusion of
nature and <i>your</i> Bible, for the young men do not alone
neglect it."</p>

<p>"Well, Jenny, I suppose we must reform them. Have
you any spare hair-cloth for vests for us, Mrs. Pendleton,
or peas to fill our shoes with? If you have, please leave
them at my door to-night when you retire, for I shall commence
my humiliation forthwith. That floating, alluring
Beatrice quite takes my fancy. I shall practice ascension
from this time forward&mdash;that is, after a few turns with the
hair-cloth and peas," said Theresa.</p>

<p>Miss Ingemann sat by while this conversation was going
on in pretty loud, animated tones, as is a common custom
with the excitable American women, and thought it was
rather free talk, especially for young ladies. Mrs. Pendleton's
loud tones, with her occasional resounding laugh, at

<!--- vol 1 page 128 -->

length quite disgusted her, and when in a very audible
whisper the latter lady asked Mrs. K&ouml;rner, with a little
mischief in the expression of her face, if she (Miss Ingemann)
was not a countess, it was altogether too much for
her dignity to bear with its usual imperturbableness, and her
lip wore a very scornful expression.</p>

<p>Afterward, Theresa was speaking with great affection of
her mother and of her father's lively interest in life and its
events, though advanced in years.</p>

<p>"Why did they not accompany you?" said Mrs. K&ouml;rner.</p>

<p>"My mother is too precious goods to be toted away
here," said she, "and the last time I went to Niagara with
my honored papa, he bothered me so by anxiously watching
me, while I stood at the end of the cars to look out
upon the scenery, that I told him I should leave him at
home the next journey I took; so I was as good as my
word, you see."</p>

<p>This was altogether too much for Miss Ingemann, who
rose to go, excusing herself in a cold, lady-like way to
Mrs. K&ouml;rner for retiring so early, and only bowed very
stiffly to the strangers as she left the room.</p>

<p>Theresa saw that her doom was sealed with at least one
member of good society in Copenhagen, and turned to
Mrs. Liebenhoff. That lady sat very quietly, making her
observations. Feeling nervous at first, as Miss Ingemann
began to manifest displeasure, she made one or two
attempts to mediate between their understandings, but
concluded on the whole, it was of no use, so resigned
herself to the enjoyment of the scene.</p>

<p>"Have I done or said anything so very shocking?" said
Theresa.</p>

<p>"O no, certainly not! I enjoy it and hope for a better
acquaintance. I like to see individuality and spirit. I will
suggest to you, however, that as you are a stranger, and
of course wish to conciliate good-will and the favorable
opinion of those whom you are to dwell among for a time,

<!--- vol 1 page 129 -->

that without losing these, a delicate sympathy and tact will
suggest when you encroach too much on our favorite
modes of speech and action. But you will acquire that
by experience. We can all learn of each other, you
know."</p>

<p>"Thank you! You are a woman of good sense, and I
hope you will let me come and see you."</p>

<p>"Most certainly," said she; "do so often. The parsonage
has open doors for all, and especially for those after
my own heart, as I see you are, with some comparatively
trifling reservations. I want my husband to know you
all."</p>

<p>"Where is Mr. Liebenhoff all this time, Lisbet? I hoped
he would come with you."</p>

<p>"O, at the church! the failing, tottering, gasping church!
There is another adjourned meeting to-night to talk over
whether the old one shall be repaired or a new one built;
and he has gone to say a few encouraging words upon the
latter plan."</p>

<p>"Do the gentlemen have adjourned meetings in Denmark
as well as in America? How provokingly alike
people are all over Christendom! I did hope that three
thousand miles would transport me to some rarities in character
and manners, but it is very much the same old story
I see, with the exception of a few unimportant exteriors.
O for a little novelty in this humdrum lower sphere!" said
Theresa.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Liebenhoff, "adjourned meetings, in
which people dole over the difficulty of a little self-sacrifice
and discourage each other into doing nothing and
being less, if possible, in our Lord's kingdom. <i>They</i> seem
to be thought the legitimate substitutes for Christian interest,
a prompt submission to the requisitions of our glorious
faith, and zeal in advancing it among men, so they meet
again and again to tell each other how little they will give for
his cause, and adjourn to withdraw mayhap their intended

<!--- vol 1 page 130 -->

pittance, because forsooth another gives less than he ought
or than he supposed he would for the same object."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is the way. What is to be done in such a
state of things?" said Mrs. Pendleton.</p>

<p>"What each one thinks right, my dear madam," said
Mrs. Liebenhoff; "I know what I am going to do."</p>

<p>When all equipped to go home, and while making their
prolonged adieux to Mrs. K&ouml;rner, who the strangers said
seemed to them like an old friend, they met Mr. Liebenhoff
upon the steps. He exchanged a few words with the
company, and then taking his wife's arm within his, walked
homewards with her.</p>

<p>"WHAT sort of a meeting did you have?" said Mrs.
Liebenhoff, as they entered their dwelling.</p>

<p>"A pretty discouraging one! Out of a multitude to
whom notices were sent, only a handful were present, and
the conclusion is, that it is impossible to build."</p>

<p>"I see no reason why; surely it is not for want of
means, prosperous and abundantly rich as they are. They
have no good excuse, but their backwardness to engage in
the work is simply a want of interest in their religious
faith, and a low style of character, which is the natural
consequence."</p>

<p>"Of course," said he, "but how to rouse them to a
higher life is the question? O, if men would not look
upon everything which they do for Christianity, which has
done so much and would do everything for them if they
would receive it in its fullness, in the light of a hard sacrifice,
as a charity which they may or may not bestow; but
as they make their homes graceful and beautiful for their
comfort, the satisfaction of their tastes and the repose of
their hearts, so should they with joy and thanksgiving, as
if from a glad necessity of their nature lay the foundation
stones of their temple of worship, which shall be to them
the home of their souls, the altar from which shall arise
their purest hopes, desires, and aspirations, and where

<!--- vol 1 page 132 -->

Heaven shall pour upon them its richest treasures of forgiveness,
consolation and love."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Liebenhoff, "but that is a point far
beyond them as yet; not but that there are many, many
excellent persons in our parish, and I love them for what
they are, and still more for what I see lying wrapped up
within them unused. But they are as yet in the beggarly
elements of a material philosophy and life, quick to discern
the coarser characteristics of intellectual power, ready to
sympathize with the subordinate wants of the moral and
physical man, and that to be sure, is a good deal, showing
an awakening mind, and some sense of obligation, but of
the higher spiritual functions of the soul, its close communion
with the Infinite, its development into a complete,
beautiful and harmonious whole, through obedience to
the laws of its being, as taught by the Christ, resulting
in the glad liberty, strength of will and all-conquering
might of its varied powers, they seem as yet not cognizant.
And to one, who step by step has toiled up the way to this
Pisgah height of contemplation and glad experience as
you have, their life seems narrow and groping, and the
very air is heavy and dim with the lack of this celestial
electricity."</p>

<p>"But how shall I inspire them with this higher life? I
am getting discouraged, and really feel that I am not fitted
to be their pastor, Lisbet."</p>

<p>"And are you impatient for the world's idol, success?"</p>

<p>"Not vulgar success; but why may I not see that I am
doing something, and not week after week, be weighed
down with this feeling of responsibility, uncheered by
tokens that my prayers, labors and unceasing thought for
them are not like water spilled upon the ground!"</p>

<p>"O, thou of little faith! but such feelings come from a
constitutional deficiency of what is a large element of my
nature, hope, never dying, but ever springing, triumphant
Hope, and it whispers to me now, that disjointed, freezing,

<!--- vol 1 page 133 -->

unfaithful, unsympathizing as a society, the members
(each one of whom individually, is a kind, good friend to
us,) are, that when the new and inspiring word is spoken
to them, they will be all the more ready for their lack of
present organization and order to combine into a living
body of&mdash;not pure, individual Christians merely, but into
the true, free, and glorious embodiment through his appointed
church, of the universal and heaven-inspired spirit
of our Lord."</p>

<p>"You are enthusiastic, my wife!"</p>

<p>"Less so than you are blamably faithless, at this moment.
But cheer up; don't think of the ugly, falling ruin
of a church. And let the people go to perdition, I say,
where they seem to tend so evidently."</p>

<p>"My dear, don't be wicked."</p>

<p>"I am not wicked. I don't wish them there, but if you
like it better, I will state the matter as a plain fact. They
are already there. Such deadness is perdition; the very
dreariest of the mansions of the under-world, in which
people grope in darkness, and wander about dead to all
the higher and more inspiring attributes of their being,
while at the same time, they hug themselves with self-satisfaction
for their cool wisdom and acute intellectualism
which saves them from the quivering sensibilities, the
flights of an imagination which abides not in their harsh,
frigid councils, and the awakened hopes which are ever on
the wing, soaring higher and higher towards the Infinite
Good."</p>

<p>"Yes, and to bring them into this state," said he, "they
must do something for themselves; and the first and simplest
and most obvious thing is for them to unite to build a
church. A common interest in this most worthy and necessary
object may be an entering wedge to a higher and better
communion between them. But somehow I have not
leadership enough to marshal them into working order."</p>

<p>"I am glad you have not, for harsh guardianship, coarse

<!--- vol 1 page 134 -->

generalship we have had enough of in Christendom. Let
us, at this late day, come to the full knowledge of the
higher spirit of oar Lord, whose kingdom is one of liberty of
action and equal responsibility for all, in proportion to each
one's powers, opportunities and means, and that the pastor
is but the teacher, inspirer, and guide of his flock, pointing
to the living pastures of perennial truth, the sunny paradise
of affection and high and pure sympathy; or perchance,
the brave, disinterested and faithful shepherd who shall
venture into the wilderness after the lost ones and bring
them forth redeemed and penitent, for others of the fold
to rejoice over with him, and protect and bless them
so that they will not desire to wander from it again.
Ministers now-a-days seem to feel that the salvation of
every soul in their parish depends upon them though there
are so many other means of enlightenment and guidance.
While it is so, you may be sure the people will drag upon
them with their full weight, it is so much easier in idea to
be carried into heaven like a babe in one's bosom than to
struggle upwards into it, step by step, like a true disciple
of Jesus. Unfold your arms then, let them hang downwards
their full length that they bear up no such lazy souls,
and wear no robe, as friend Geiser would say, to which
the unfaithful may cling and thus be smuggled into the
courts above; for if they can show no title but <i>such</i> selfish
dependence upon their wasting, yet faithful, untiring friend,
they will surely be banished thence by their judge and
yours."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope all will come right; I feel that if I could be
the instrument of rousing them&mdash;not a few of the rich and
mature in years and experience merely, but each and all,
young men and maidens, the poor and the struggling to do
this holy work, as an expression of their faith in, and love
for God and their Saviour, that I should be satisfied to withdraw
and leave them to the councils of one who could better
express for them their wants and aspirations."</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 135 -->

<p>"Heaven knows who it would be or whether they have
any. But yes, they cannot be devoid of them as I know
they are real men and women, and not phantoms, most
certainly they are too prone to earth for that, and they seem
outwardly to possess all the characteristics of human beings.
Yes&mdash;O yes, certainly they must be human, for, as
I before said, they are our dear kind friends in private
life; but now I have it, they are under the spell of some
wicked genius, who, the moment that the great words&mdash;God,
Christ, Religion, the Soul, the Bible, are uttered
as to a society, are changed into 'spirits of the vasty
deep,' whose senses are so deadened by the element in
which they are condemned to live that they hear not, and
therefore come not up, as a matter of course, when the
sweet music of your heavenly piety vibrates upon the air.
They need the thunder, and lightning, and earthquake, those
coarser ministers of God's dispensation to men to reach
them in their low estate. <i>They</i> are the stern law, and
let it rule them if they would have it, for not even the
refreshing rain which follows the war of the elements,
which is like wisdom to men's minds, can they recognize,
much, much less the celestial dew, which is his love, distilled
in this most gentle and ethereal form. Such is the
utterance of Christian truth by you in your most natural
and legitimate way, for to this elevation have your faith and
obedience lifted you. Had you stopped short in the first,
the Xantippe plane, you would be called great; for in this
is the world chiefly, and that of course is mighty in its
eyes which expresses themselves in a slightly ideal form,
but if ever you were in that, it was in the pre-existent state
if there was one, but not in this. You have climbed up
through the second period, and the benign spirit of Wisdom
has become one with you, and men see her not because
she stalks not about nor cries in the streets. But hand in
hand with Love, the heavenly pair modestly wait upon you
and point you ever to 'the well undefiled' of crystal Truth,

<!--- vol 1 page 136 -->

and you draw from it and dispense to those who are so
many fathoms below you, that so few of its drops penetrate
to their souls that they are not impressed."</p>

<p>"What a rhapsody! but I shall not dispute you. What
husband loves not to be praised and idealized by his wife!
<i>You</i> are my parish, my church, my&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you for nothing. I'll be neither, I've long
been jealous of both, and now you shall set them aside
and admire and be at leisure, and make love to me in a
more individual manner, and not as a necessary part of
this provoking, stupid parish. Do you know that all this
heart-ache and these disappointed hopes come from your
false, unnatural notion of living for humanity and not
for me?"</p>

<p>"My dear Lisbet, what do you mean? Are you turning
tempter to warp me from the high duty to which I early
dedicated my life? God first, and humanity next, has
always been my motto. Then come other claims; <i>the me</i>
must have the next share, else how could I accomplish the
first, and then my own loved wife, and have I been remiss
towards you, dearest?"</p>

<p>"Now you doubtless expect, after my rhapsody as you
call it upon you and your preaching, that I shall most dutifully
answer, 'O no, my liege lord and anointed husband!
I am only too thankful for the droppings from the sanctuary
of your divided heart. Shiver it into as many fragments
as your swollen sense of responsibility sees fit; I receive the
smallest iota of it with the most gentle and satisfied submission.'
But no! I say again, I subscribe to no such
falsehood of creed or unfaithfulness of life. You are
quite in the wrong about this matter. My instincts have
always rebelled against my position in your life's category
of interests, and now my whole nature is up in arms to
contend against it. I have spelled it all out and now I am
going to give you a sermon from these words of your
brother divine slightly paraphrased; 'God has hid away the

<!--- vol 1 page 137 -->

human soul in a <i>woman's</i> form that in finding it we may
rediscover our alienated and forgotten nature and rejoice
over the one that was lost more than the ninety and nine
who went not astray.' "</p>

<p>"What do you mean, my love?"</p>

<p>"Only that you are a tyrant and a hypocrite and a&mdash;no
wonder you stare, my archangel, who, all the women protest,
is the most beautiful, the most amiable, the most
agreeable, the most saintly, in short the most immaculate
of all mankind on this floating globe, and that I am the
most fortunate, the most blessed, the most ought-to-be-thankful
little woman, who is all but drowned in the ocean of her
husband's perfection! Pshaw! did they not serve old
Aristides right, whom all fools surnamed 'The Just?' I
wish I had been at Athens to throw in my shell of ostracism
with that single wise man who had got tired of hearing
him perpetually praised. He had doubtless been to
his wife and asked her how he was at home, and she had
told him some truths about him. Banish him, I say, and
that crabbed old Socrates, parading round with his impudent
questions and prosy old saws. Xantippe knew how
much they were worth, and she scolded him as he deserved.
I wish she had boxed his ears when she was about it, hard
enough for the tingling to come down the ages through
every husband's ears, seeing that most of us are restrained
by the idea that it is not ladylike to perform the deed, from
doing that same thing. Give him the hemlock, I say&mdash;the
hard, quizzing, conceited, tyrannical husband, who wickedly
married for the very worst reason that he could. O thou, so
called god, Esculapius! to whom the weak, mistaken, short-sighted
man sacrificed a cock after all his pretended
advance before the age, why could ye not have gone to the
rescue of that much injured and scandalized Xantippe&mdash;wife
of his I will not again insult her by calling her&mdash;and
given her of your skill to mingle with her libation
some potion to soften his hard understanding for a true

<!--- vol 1 page 138 -->

idea of <i>her</i> to penetrate, that through his, thus enlightened
mind, there might flow into his heart a pittance at least of
the love which was her right, but which his philosophico,
coldly moralistico, anything but tenderly spiritualistico
nature denied her! O Xantippe! most injured, most to-be
compassionated woman! here I erect a statue to perpetuate
your wrongs, and thy delinquent husband shall kneel
for thy pardon for his injustice and tyranny towards thee,
and as thou wert a woman, and in that word dwells the
very soul of forgiveness, when thou seest him thus humiliated
and repentant, thou wilt raise him even to a higher
level than thyself, that then, without injury to thy delicate
sense of right and truth, thou mayst revere, as thy nature
ever craves to do, him who when humble and tender, and
not until then, becomes truly exalted! And so endeth the
first head of my sermon; the moral of which is, that as
your wife is a part of humanity, and God said when you
married her that you should forsake father and mother and
cleave unto her, saying nothing about parish and church,
as you see; next to your own culture and salvation are
you to devote yourself to her happiness and welfare, and
in this way only can you twain become truly and emphatically
one, and thereby be in harmony with God and his
beautiful universe."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, what am I to do? kneel for forgiveness
or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait, until I have finished my sermon. Pretty well
too, for a minister, to speak in meeting! But I must ask
you, however, if that is not well done? Now that is what
the people would call great. Why can you not preach so
to <i>them?</i> I am sure they deserve it enough."</p>

<p>"I will exchange with you the next Sunday, and you
may add a little different collar and wristbands, as we
preachers say to an old sermon, and give it to them hot
and strong."</p>

<p>"Well then, I must go on to the <i>secondly</i>, and by way

<!--- vol 1 page 139 -->

of rehearsal, will imagine myself in church. And seeing
that I wandered from my subject, ('an uncommon event
for a woman;' said Mr. Liebenhoff,) on account of the
imperfect education which tyrant man awards to her, thereby
condemning her to lamentable scatter-wittedness, I will
again return to the forcible text: 'God has hidden away
the human soul in a <i>woman's</i> form, etc.' And, my brethren,
as she, the least sinful portion of society, through
your generous regard for her moral and spiritual welfare,
and especially that she might become a meet, obedient and
adoring subject of her lord and master, has by means of
books, pictures, conversation and the ministration of the
word applied especially to her, as also by the laws and institutions
of our country been happily reduced to a very
submissive condition; I will address my discourse entirely
to you, hoping that you will be equally docile in the reception
of this great truth, as she has been in listening to
the homilies daily afforded her by your disinterested sex."</p>

<p>"You are getting personal, my dear! They will tell
you, as they did me, that you will break up the society."</p>

<p>"The same answer is not yet worn out, 'let it break
up then, if it is made of so flimsy materials.'</p>

<p>"And, first, I need not dwell upon this basis of all religions,
the great and sacred idea of a Supreme, Intelligent
and Parental Spirit, except to remind you that as of old it was
reiterated again and again, that it dwelt not in idols made
of wood and stone, in either the human or animal form, so
neither does it any more, when converted into banks, warehouses,
or any of the forms into which <i>business</i> is transacted
or <i>money</i> made, nor even in any great man, whether
Pope, Emperor, Noble, or Genius. Therefore I will pass
on to the next clause.</p>

"<i>Secondly, Hidden,</i> etc. A very significant word, my
hearers, informing you of what you have not sufficiently
considered, that a woman may possess more than what you
with your pre-occupied attention and narrow judgment

<!--- vol 1 page 140 -->

of her duty and destiny had thought possible or necessary,
and therefore indicating that she was created for some
wider and higher purpose than simply to be the minister
to your pleasure or honor, or even comfort and solace
under your heavy labors and responsibilities in the great
cause of doing good. For, my brethren of the priestly
order! of whom I see some among you, did it never occur
to you that while you are dispensing the bread of life to
multitudes of souls outside of your homes, and being the
sympathizers, guides, and chief laborers of society in matters
pertaining to their moral and religious welfare, indeed
their willing drudges and servants of all work, from the
chosen one of expounding to them the Holy Word and
leading them onward to the celestial gate, to every imaginable
secular errand which they may impose upon you; did
it never occur to you, I say, that while spreading your
sympathies over creation, and calling upon her likewise to
keep even pace with yourself, that <i>her</i> Innermost in the
meantime either remained unawakened and sterile, or else
became preternaturally excited without being justly responded
to by you who have all humanity to cater for?
She therefore goes moaning and shrieking through life till
her intense and bitter cry for the natural and necessary
food of her being has caused even the angels, who dwell
in the nearer presence of God, to stand aghast at her cry."</p>

<p>"A pungent discourse! Spare me, I beg," said Mr.
Liebenhoff.</p>

<p>"O don't take it to yourself! Pass it to your fellow-hearers
as is the usual custom.</p>

<p>"<i>Thirdly;</i> 'The human soul in a <i>woman's</i> form.' My
brethren, we feel no disposition to deny you the possession
of intellectual strength; that element which is sometimes
called talent, that power of fixing the attention upon truth,
of holding it up as if it were a crystal before the mind's
eye; viewing it on every side deliberately and patiently,
until you have drawn from it all its possible deductions.

<!--- vol 1 page 141 -->

Nor do I deny you the practical power of subduing to your
dominion all the ruder forces of nature and making them
subservient to the well-being of man. But to the feminine
soul, my hearers, must be awarded <i>par eminence</i>, the possession
of genius, that divine inspiration, which enables
her at a glance to pierce to the very heart of the truths
which, by diligence and hard labor, ye slowly attain unto;
and though from time to time, this faculty may show itself
in full blaze in your sex, it is because that they are invested
in a larger degree than is common with the feminine element.
But the woman's soul, when nurtured by holy love,
nourished by truth, led and imbosomed by nature, made
strong and faithful and tender by obedience to the Christ,
and ever bathed and invigorated, and inspired by communion
with the Infinite, stands forth with no peer, call me
not profane, but I repeat, <i>with no peer</i>, as the most glorious
and beautiful representative of God in the world; for
through her plastic, docile, and confiding nature, He is able
to reveal, if not with more clearness, yet with more graceful
and winning beauty, than through the more self-sufficient
and unyielding man, his designs in the development of
the races. And when, as the mother of infant humanity,
she moves among you, mild, tender, and gracious, do justice
to your better nature and give her your tenderest veneration;
for even the angels clasp their hands and gaze
reverently upon her and say: See how, under her loving
care, the bud of immortality will bloom sweetly and fairly
until it is garnered with us into the paradise of our God!"</p>

<p>"Any more, my dear? for I am sorry to say that I grow
sleepy."</p>

<p>"You always do when you don't preach yourself, and
some say that you are a little drowsy then, you know; so
you must bear with my first imperfect effort. Courage! I
have got fully half through, I do believe.</p>

<p>"<i>Fourthly;</i> 'That in finding it we may re-discover our
alienated and forgotten nature.' Upon this head it is

<!--- vol 1 page 142 -->

necessary to say but few words; for it is very evident that
man cannot lose sight of the divine in one large portion of
creation, and that so important a part as its better half,
and blasphemously imagine that he is to appropriate its
precious wealth to his trifling or injurious tastes, or at best
to his selfish consolation, encouragement, and use, without
fearful deterioration and loss. For all God's children rise
or remain in limbo, or fall together through the mysterious
sympathy which binds them in unity; and when one suffers
physically, intellectually, or spiritually, all creation groans
and agonizes with it. Therefore, my brethren, listen to
this, my asseveration, ponder it and let it sink deep into
your hearts, and thenceforward have a radical, perceptible,
and most potent influence over your principles, sentiments,
characters, institutions and laws, that woman has an <i>individual,
independent, and responsible soul</i>, subject only to
the God who created it, worthy of the highest, broadest,
and most delicate culture which may be brought from every
part of the universe, to aid in its perfect and harmonious
development. And by means of this essential and heaven-ordered
work you will arrive, my poor, ignorant, and purblind
brethren, at this very evident and joy-inspiring truth,
written upon your own natures it is true, and repeatedly
revealed more distinctly all through the six thousand years
of the world's existence, but which, lacking the clear
glance of her genius, and still more, her obedient will, you
are yet in doubt of, or practically, at least, deny altogether
that you also are the possessors of the same great gift
which I here announce in the loudest tones awarded to me,
that <i>man as well as woman has an immortal soul</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>Fifthly;</i> 'And rejoice more over it than over the ninety
and nine,' etc. Yes, my brethren, when this glad truth is
once and forever established, then will the world begin to
stride with long steps in the march of advancement. For
see you not its grand significance and tendency, the sublime
value it will give to every human being, and the

<!--- vol 1 page 143 -->

fearful consequences of marring, in any way, either by sin
or oppression, or wrong of any kind, this great handiwork
of God, and the necessity and privilege of aiding in educating
and training this child of the ages, this heir of eternity?
In this glad work let the male and female soul enter
with joy and thanksgiving; let the feminine part of the
Gospel be henceforward acknowledged, and great will be
their mutual reward."</p>

<p>"Pretty good for a first attempt! You will improve if
you practice."</p>

<p>"O! I have a great deal more to say upon the same
theme, but the people would vote me a visionary and fanatic
at once, so I spare myself and them. Here endeth the
first lesson!"</p>

<p>"MY own Zo&euml;, how neatly you are dressed and how
sweetly you look," said Hilda one afternoon, as she entered
their apartment just as the former had completed her
toilet; "are you going out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to my dear Mrs. Liebenhoff's; she told me to
come and see her whenever I liked to, and that I might
run up directly into her room, and if she were gone out I
might make myself at home among her books and medallions
and pictures until she returned; and I know she
meant every word she said, for I can tell</p>

<p class="small">"The true soul very well.<br/>

Without book or bell."</p>

<p>"And it makes you happy, don't it, love? Well, I am
glad you have found another mate to rest your sad eyes
upon once in a while; for mine, I well know, are such
dancing, twinkling orbs that yours don't get from them
much of the repose they plead for. I shall not be at all
jealous of the quiet parsoness. She will be a nice little
cushion for you to lean against; but when you want life,
enthusiasm, and love of the strong order you will come
back to me."</p>

<p>"You don't know Mrs. Liebenhoff, Hilda, for&mdash;"</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 145 -->

<p>"Bless me! don't fire up in that way for a trifle, for I
give you fair warning, my Titania, that be duped as you
may, you shall not lead me to believe there is a beauty or
a heroine of romance in that ordinary little face and figure.
Fall in love with her as much as you please and rhapsodize
her high qualities, I see nothing in her but a nice little
minister's wife, very quiet under the heavenly influence
of my dearly beloved friend, her husband, who is a great
deal too handsome and interesting and learned and everything
else for her mediocre passivity. (She takes both her
hands and lifts Zo&euml;'s face towards her own.) I see I have
swept you into the indignant mood and objective case, to
be governed by none of my analysis of her style, type,
sentiment, or covering. But, my precious pet of a brunette
with the sweeping, silken eyelashes, and the raven-winged
hair, how pretty and fresh she looks!" and she
stooped and kissed her forehead.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am trying to save my soul by what seems a
prime article of Miss Ingemann's creed&mdash;a clean white
skirt every other day, faultless gloves, and gossamer hose.
It is rather a hard way of climbing up into the third heaven
of her affections; I have very little faith that I shall succeed,
for so far it is scrambling up two steps to fall plump
down twenty, as I did to-day."</p>

<p>"Why how?" said Hilda, looking anxious. "I thought
you were getting rapidly into her good graces for the last
fortnight. Do tell me what has happened."</p>

<p>"Well, my best Hilda, after your remarks about my dress
and habits, I determined to make an effort to be very
orderly and proper, and as papa about that time sent me
some money, I purchased some necessary articles of apparel
so as to be as new all over as that figure in the shop-window
up town, who every morning as she turns by
clockwork, seems to say with a smirk, 'See how handsome
I am, please to copy me and look as stiff and unhuman as
I do.' "</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 146 -->

<p>"That you intend for me, because my dress stands out
so full to-day, but this hair-cloth will yield in time. I don't
want to look like a Grecian statue, you know, which is
pretty in a book, or in a gallery of the fine arts, but not in
life, it has such a draggled appearance."</p>

<p>"I know, I have made no complaint. The greatest inconvenience
of it is, that one has to circumnavigate the
globe to get around you, which seems a waste of time and
steps you know, when one goes for a glass of water or a
pocket handkerchief; but that is not to the purpose. To
return&mdash;</p>

<p>"I could not afford to have so much washing done, so I
thought I would do some of it myself before the family
rose in the morning, and I asked Annette, the cook, if she
would be so kind as to allow me to do so. She is very
good you know, and she told me that as I was not strong,
that she would do it for me; but I could not consent to
that, because she has to work so hard. So I told her we
would change, if she pleased; I would make her breakfast
cakes and she might be my laundress."</p>

<p>"And those nice muffins, and fritters, and other goodies
were yours then? I wondered that Annette's genius
should flower all at once in the culinary line, for she is
wanting in skill usually. But how did you learn, pray?"</p>

<p>"It requires nothing but common sense, care, patience,
and a cookbook to make good cakes, and if one has a delicate
sense of taste and smell, it is all in one's favor.

<p>"Affairs went on very smoothly for some time; I had a
nice, funny hour with Annette in the kitchen-yard with the
fresh morning air blowing upon me, and her to crack jokes
with, and to pet me as nobody does, in this cold north
world but you, Hilda, and I shone out like the sun in my
freshness and cleanliness as you so often tell me now-a-days."</p>

<p>"And have you smoothed down your hair with the sadiron,
my roly-poly, or what has come over your ebony

<!--- vol 1 page 147 -->

locks to quell them to such becoming obedience? They
really look like smooth and dutiful Christians, and not
like Pagan fury-emblems, darting at one from every point,
as they used to do."</p>

<p>"Don't you see this tamarind seed band, which my own
devoted, loving, ever-thoughtful mamma, daughter of the
sun and southern cross, sister of the trade-winds, and wife
of the earthquake of the tropics sent me by the last ship?
That is the Delilah which has subdued them to such
docility, my friend, nothing else would have had such
power."</p>

<p>"Save me from its magical influence," said Hilda,
throwing up her hands and starting back with affected
terror; "you were such a witch before, that I had thoughts
of getting Mr. Liebenhoff to bring his Bible and prayer-book
and attempt to lay you. But now, I am afraid you
are beyond the power of them all."</p>

<p>"The Bible! that is my wand, my horoscope, my talisman
as you ought to know by this time," said Zo&euml;, taking a
small copy of a Testament from her pocket and pressing
it to her breast, and looking upwards. "Lay me, do you
say? it rather carries me to the heaven of heavens, where
I ever, ever thirst to be dwelling." And she remained
rapt for a moment.</p>

<p>Hilda looked on with a mingled expression of awe,
anxiety and fun. The latter prevailing, she touched Zo&euml;'s
chin with her fan, saying, "Please to descend to the history
of batter-cakes and clean hose, for you left them both
in limbo, and it is but common justice to release them."</p>

<p>"Well, as I was saying, matters went on very well until
yesterday morning, when I discovered by Miss Ingemann's
conversation in an adjoining room, that she had learned
from Annette all about our bargain. She was not angry,
but on the contrary, I caught enough of her conversation,
(for I was taking my music lesson, and had to be a listener
against my will,) to know that she thought she had found

<!--- vol 1 page 148 -->

out what I was fit for, and that it was a pity to spoil a good
cook by laboring so hard to teach me the studies and accomplishments
of a lady, and that she was going to encourage
my becoming an adept in the business, by permitting me to
spend more than my usual two hours a week in household
occupations. Then at dinner, (you were away and did not
hear it,) she smiled upon me most graciously, and praised
in an undue manner, some tarts which I had made; and
the tea-cake last evening, and in short made me feel so all
over like a little pastry-cook and nothing else, that I was
angry, mortified and overwhelmed with confusion."</p>

<p>"You should not be so sensitive, child! Miss Ingemann
meant to be kind to you then, why could you not love her
for it instead of feeling so badly about it?"</p>

<p>"It is the last time she will be kind, I think, even in
that way," said Zo&euml;; "for this morning as I wished my
white Josey to be clean to wear this afternoon, I went into
the kitchen again, and while Annette was doing it up, I
made a 'Charlotte Russe' for dessert, and thinking over my
mortification, I forgot some of the ingredients, and not
having my wits about me, I had no skill, and such a mess
as I prepared was a sorry sight to behold. Miss Ingemann
ordered it away from the dining-room before the family
assembled and cast a glance at me, as much as to say,
'You spiteful creature! you did this purposely,' and
I verily believe she thinks I did, in revenge for her
praising me, for she saw that I was not pleased when she
did so."</p>

<p>"O no, darling! she can't be so unreasonable. But do let
her praise you, Zo&euml;, even for such things. I like the article
so well that I shall never quarrel with it, not even with
downright flattery if it is laid on ever so thick. I flourish
under it like a green bay tree, you see. To-be-sure, if it
were not for my adorable saint, Zo&euml;, to whom I ever kneel and
look up to, as my patroness and example, I know I should
be spoiled, but with her image ever in my heart to shield

<!--- vol 1 page 149 -->

me from evil, I gather in the good gifts of this wicked
world and make the most of them."</p>

<p>"O Hilda! I wish I were good for anything for your
sake, but I am not; and if I ever for a brief hour forget it,
such praises and such cutting rebukes, as Miss Ingemann
gives me, bring the sad truth back in full force and utterly
discourage me. O! what am I fit for in such a world as
this, where everybody seems strong and happy and at
home but me?" and she leaned her head dejectedly on
her hand.</p>

<p>"Come, my willow, let me tie upon your topmost bough
this rosebud of a hat, which will brighten up your drooping
pensiveness a little. There, puff! (fanning her with force
and at the same time blowing upon her), away, flutter into
the arms of your paragon friend, the Liebenhoff feminine.
You are welcome to her if you leave me my 'Aladdin,' my
'Correggio,' my spiritual 'Frithiof Saga,' 'the Minister of
the children of the Holy Supper,' the Liebenhoff masculine.
I wonder you do not fall down before him; he really
looks so much like the Christ that hangs there before us."</p>

<p>"Hilda!" said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"My dear, don't suppose I confound the conception of
some, I have no doubt, very human artist with our Saviour
himself. It is not wicked to speak so of his work, especially
if I do it with a very sorrowful face, is it? my
apostle, (drawing down her features). Good-by, I will
come at twilight and walk home with you."</p>

<p>"I don't like to hear such trifling reference to anything
connected with our Lord; but good-by, I will wait for
you."</p>

<p class="small">(<i>Hilda alone.</i>)</p>

<p>"The shadows deepen around her when I had flattered
myself they were clearing away a little. What is to be
done now? I am tired of being a 'medium' between
heaven in the shape of Zo&euml;, and the world in Miss Ingemann
and people in general. Our dear Lord must see

<!--- vol 1 page 150 -->

something more of good in me than I have ever been able
to discover, to give this precious little soul so much into
my keeping so far as to shield her from utter misery on
the world's side, or on the other to prevent her dissolving
into the heavenly sphere before her time. But as she
grows older she is too much for me in both directions. I
am not ready yet to be transfigured and find myself behind
the vail at merry seventeen. I want to enjoy myself in a
lively, human, coquettish way with flesh-and-blood belles
and beaux, so when I find that she is carrying me into too
rare an atmosphere for such sinners to follow, I lift up the
valve for the gas to escape, and down my balloon falls.
Then on the other side, I am so tried by our teacher's
prejudices and the girls' mean notions of Zo&euml;, caught from
her, that I don't know but my temper will be spoiled, and
that would be a pity, seeing I am such an angel. Heigh-ho!
I know well that I was made to be as joyous as a butterfly
all the day long, and if the wicked world chooses to spoil
the handiwork of my Maker, by making me sad and
anxious by their treatment of Zo&euml;, why they must take the
awful consequences, that is all. But one gleam of light
there is in the direction of the minister; for I rely more on
his wise and kind friendship than on anything his wife may
do. So I desire to be thankful for so much."</p>

<p>When Mrs. Liebenhoff returned from her walk in a distant
part of the city, she found Zo&euml; reclining on her couch
looking very intently upon the face of a Sybil, which hung
on the opposite wall. She presented so perfect a picture
of luxurious, dreamy, passionate orientalism, redeemed
from its sensuous character by the pure Madonna-like expression
which was natural to it, that she paused in the
doorway to gaze upon her. Finding that she was utterly
absorbed by her own reverie, which might outlast her capacity
of standing, fatigued as she was, she advanced and
stood over her.</p>

<p>"And can you really find it in your heart to pardon me

<!--- vol 1 page 151 -->

for walking into your air-castle and shivering it into atoms
as I have done! It was a beautiful structure, was it not?
And now that it is demolished, how very bare and uninteresting
the world and all of us who remain on its site look!
Come, my little architect, lay aside all your moonbeam implements,
and gossamer frame-work and spider's-web materials
generally, and let us have a good, sensible chat
together," said she.</p>

<p>"Pardon me for my freedom in lounging thus. I fear I
exceed the bounds of your kindness," said Zo&euml;, rising and
smoothing the pillow.</p>

<p>Mrs. Liebenhoff tenderly bade her welcome. "O no, no,
dear," said she, "the couch is not damaged at all by such
indulgence, nor by making it the scone of your subtle
masonry; for twenty castles, no heavier than the one you
were constructing, would not injure it at all by their pressure;
but are you quite sure that <i>your innermost</i> retains its
integrity as well after this intoxicating occupation?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;I fear not; but I am ashamed to say that
I am good for nothing besides. I am different from every
body else, and&mdash;and&mdash;the fact is, I don't like the world as
it is&mdash;I never did, and I don't think I ever shall&mdash;so I just
build and live in one of my own. If I were made like
you, my dear madam, and could do everything in its season,
and be contented and happy all the time, I should be <i>so</i>
glad, for I really do not know what is to become of me in
this practical world. You know that I am of Oriental descent,
for I have lately discovered that fact, and I have a
right to be dreamy."</p>

<p>"Zo&euml;, it is not because I am so unlike, but that I see in
you the reflected image, as it were, of my youthful self,
that my deepest heart yearns towards you as it does. I
seldom speak of my interior life, for it has ever been so
hidden with God and his Christ, that it answers not to the
call of any feeble or faltering sympathy; but for you, my
darling, who are approaching that perilous period, 'the

<!--- vol 1 page 152 -->

parting of the ways,' which divides childhood from womanhood,
I am impelled to reveal to you some of its story, hoping
that it may serve as a kindly hint to you."</p>

<p>"O, thank you, dear Mrs. Liebenhoff; how favored I
am!"</p>

<p>"I, too, am an Oriental," said she, "in temperament
and mental tendency, and formerly I marveled, that with the
breath of the Sirocco wind sweeping through my soul, with
every pore of my nature thirsting like the banyan tree for
the dewy moisture and copious showers of sympathy, affection
and intimate companionship, I should be planted in the
snowy north, where the pulse beats to an even tenor, and
a preponderance of physical life saves from the intensity
of existence within. But as I grow older and interpret
more clearly that wonderful human nature with which God
has invested us, and glance with steadier vision into the
life within life, soul within soul, of this great universe of
his planning, and my being like that same plant of multitudinous
unity from its center spreads out indefinitely and
roots itself in the common soil, only to spring up again and
again to absorb the all-enlightening sun's rays, and drink
in the fertilizing offerings of the clouds, I seem to myself
no longer peculiar and solitary, but as one most emphatically
with the great company of my sex all over the world.
The chief distinction is, that through God and the mysterious
ways of his Providence, there has been burned into
my soul a deeper impression of its wrongs, a wider knowledge
of its character and its wants, and a higher sense of
its aspirations, than is awarded to all. And as these would
but consume me by their excess, and burst my very being
asunder by the cry which they bring up from its depths,
did I not utter what is in me, it seems an intimation that I
should do so in the ways which seem truest and best to
me, though I yield with the deed the most precious privilege
of my life. For to the shrinking soul of the true
woman, publicity is ever most painful, and nothing can

<!--- vol 1 page 153 -->

compensate her for making merchandise of her thoughts
which have been a highway only between herself and the Infinite,
but a purpose which is paramount to a merely selfish
advantage and enjoyment, though these may be the greatest
and purest of which we are capable."</p>

<p>"And are you going to write a book, dear Mrs. Liebenhoff?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I cannot but hope that it may be an aid to
you, Zo&euml;, in the discipline of your mind, which, in its chief
characteristics, seems so much like my own."</p>

<p>"O I know it will; but in the meantime, please tell me
more about yourself, just to me, a little simple girl you
know, who likes her own secrets kept too well to betray
any of yours;" and she nestled close beside her as she
said this.</p>

<p>"Now I am not going to begin as the biographers do, 'I
was born in such a place,' etc., but shall rather take you
for the subject of my story, and <i>I</i> shall point the moral,"
said she, throwing her arm around her.</p>

<p>"I am so disappointed," said Zo&euml;, "for it can't be entertaining
with such a foolish, uninteresting heroine, with no
beauty even to recommend her. Please skip the story and
give me the moral."</p>

<p>"What an uncommon young woman, to prefer prosy
moral to a pretty story! I have great hopes that it <i>will</i> be
interesting with such an original subject to deal with.
Here it is. 'Far, far away, away from over the great
ocean, there once came to this land a little sun-browned
Ethiopian, with the touch of the same artist hand upon the
waves of her hair, and with teeth, of which, the elephant,
kneeling to her mamma before her birth-day, begged her
to carve some for the Zo&euml; which soon was to <i>be</i>. For, by
that name, which means life, said she, shall my darling be
called, for, from the life of our Father in Heaven, its father
on earth, my life and the life of the universe, shall she be
fitly created. And so one bright morning there was joy in

<!--- vol 1 page 154 -->

the household, for Zo&euml; had descended from the Heaven on
high, and to their eyes the ray of light which was its car,
justly provided, still rested above it. O, sweet were the
visions of the blessed young mother! O, tender the
glance of the dark, thoughtful father! And gentle her
dreams of the lisping companion, who should fly o'er the
sea-beach with feet like birds' pinions, and gather with her
the bright shells of the tropics. But big were the hopes
of the strong, manly father, that she should honor his name
by her beauty of character, and the lore which could only
be gathered afar.</p>

<p>" 'And so one strange morning, when the rain deluged
the household, though a star in the East shone brightly
above, which the father interpreted to be Zo&euml;, returning in
her lovely young womanhood, she set sail for the land of
her exile and discipline, which was to give her the glory
which was to gladden their souls.</p>

<p>" 'Our Zo&euml;, weird-being, grows apace, with two magnified
eyes, one which looks backward and homeward, straining
to catch glimpses of the emerald isle of the blue Caribbean,
with its perennial life and deep-dyed vegetation, of
its quivering sun, love-smitten with its beauty, and wedded
for aye, to this <i>Saint of the Cross</i>.</p>

<p>" 'But more eagerly than all, does she pine for the arms
of her own loved mamma, to inclose her with tenderness
and for the lullaby song of her father at even, to hush her
to rest.</p>

<p>" 'The other glance is upward to the heaven of heavens
for its light, which but dimly is granted to her impatient
expectations and feverish cry.</p>

<p>" 'But Zo&euml;, my darling, drop your eyelids and strain not
your orbs to pierce the blue vault for the&mdash;'Thus saith
your God,' to be written upon it, nor listen for the audible
summons to the work of your life, and still your heart-yearnings
for the dear ones at home.

<p>" 'But what shall supply to the fancy-fraught mind the

<!--- vol 1 page 155 -->

food of her being, the aim of her life, and inspiration to
labor. Simply the duty which lieth the nearest, and every
good word spoken by all who surround you, no less than
the Scriptures and prayer to the Highest, for he has made
you, my own, with more than two eyes&mdash;with a being wondrously
varied, and to glorify him by its flower like development
is your first obligation.</p>

<p>" 'Yet be not too selfish in acquiring the knowledge
which is to open like a key, this beautiful nature, for we
are bound to each other by a mystical chain, and to preserve
it in its lustre and smoothness, we must ever be brightening
it by some fresh object of sympathy, and what can be
better than to study and express to each other by deed
more than word, the beauty and excellence of the dealings
and works of our God?' "</p>

<p>"Thank you for the lesson, and for my birth history
which I knew not before. I will write it to mamma in my
next letter, it may be new even to her. And now for the
moral!"</p>

<p>"O Zo&euml;, if you would only remember and heed it, how
glad I should be, but I see in your eye, that your imagination
more than your reason and sense of danger are
affected by my Tale! Nevertheless, you shall have it, and
though you are too much preoccupied by your gaze backwards
and forwards and into the realm of fancy into which
you have grown, to regard it, yet like the seed sown by
the wayside, it may some time spring up and give new life
to your being.</p>

<p>"For this is its essential truth, that woman needs strength
as well as beauty, and tenderness, and aspiration. For
lacking this, she is like the ship in full sail upon the wide
and fearful sea without a helm to direct or ballast to steady
her motion. Like the eagle soaring to the gates of heaven
with an eye that can gaze without blinking upon the centre
of Infinity itself, and yet without the sure-guiding foot and
the weight acquired by the mingling with the earthy and

<!--- vol 1 page 156 -->

commonplace, she will turn over and over with absurd
gyrations in the atmosphere, causing the groundlings by
turns to wonder and adore, only to laugh and deride all the
more when, draggled and torn, her wings lie soiled in the
dust and her clairvoyant eye is dim in bewilderment or
death. And this saving force, this power over the imagination
and fancy, those beautiful but perilous pinions of
the soul, can be gained only by patient toil, watchful care,
and self-crucifixion. Give up the reins to them and you
are lost, perhaps for aye. Keep them in check, bring up
the conscience, the reason, the power of labor, the sense
of awe and love of the Infinite and of humanity into harmonious
correspondence, and no eye of earth is strong and
clear enough to see into the future glory, even of your terrestrial
being, while Vestal and Sybil, prophetess and
seeress were but meagre types in the ancient times of the
celestial glory of womanhood, thus exalted by the complete
action of Christian truth and the self-discipline it enjoins.
The genius of her tender, imaginative, sensitive soul requires
the sweep of all the choicest of creation to nurture
it, and when these come at her bidding through daily exertion
in gathering the wealth of the past and present, contemplation
and glad conformity to all the higher laws of
our Creator, like the flower which blooms into loveliness
and fragrance by a higher will than its own, like the coral
which builds its worlds by a law superior to itself, though
through its obedience it is permitted to bloom in instinctive
and conscious life at its summit, so does she go gladly on
in the way of his appointment, and Poetry, Painting, Music,
and Sculpture, ay, and even Philosophy and the orator's
gift become but playthings in her power."</p>

<p>"O glorious!" said Zo&euml;; "how can I be all this? It is
the ideal of my life, the more than wildest hope of my
brightest day-dream."</p>

<p>"Not simply by dreaming and aspiring, nor even by
purifying your nature at the perennial fount of truth,

<!--- vol 1 page 157 -->

nor even by the prayer of your most saintly hours, but by
hard labor, by dutiful performance of every duty which is
nearest you, through every season of your life."</p>

<p>"The great Thorwaldsen told me as much when I was
a little girl. I have never forgotten it, but it seems as if I
were disobeying one law of my nature while obeying
another, to do all the duties which Miss Ingemann imposes
upon me, so I get puzzled."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Zo&euml;?" said Mrs. Liebenhoff. "I
know that your teacher is of a rather stern nature, but I
had always supposed her a woman of high principle."</p>

<p>"O yes, she is most truthful and conscientious. We
have grown up under her care with a hatred of everything
false and unworthy; but she is very rigid in her decrees
towards every one alike. For instance, she thinks mathematics
a prime discipline of the mind, and we all have to
take such awful doses of it. To Hilda it comes natural to
calculate, and she says it has done her giddy head-piece,
as the dear girl calls it, a deal of good; but I have no
talent for it, my head aches, my heart is discouraged, and
I become utterly frantic over my hard problems, and Miss
Ingemann I verily believe thinks I am <i>non compos</i>, and I
can't but think treats me accordingly. Did you like to
study Algebra, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear; it would be a sight to see the regiment
of artillery, cavalry, and dragoons who could conquer the
citadel of my tower of intellect and hang upon its bruised
and battered walls, as I am sure they would be, a banner
with a problem in Quadratic Equations well solved, for a
symbol of victory. No, no, judge my <i>mens</i> by its capacity
for algebra, and I am minus altogether."</p>

<p>"That is really encouraging. I wish Miss Ingemann
knew it. We should get on much better together if that
study was permitted to go by the board, for I am a dreadful
trial to her in this respect, and she to me no less, to tell
the truth. I dream of her some nights as a guide-board to

<!--- vol 1 page 158 -->

heaven, with puzzling sums all over her, which I am to
work out truly or lose my chance of salvation."</p>

<p>"I will speak to Miss Ingemann," said Mrs. Liebenhoff;
"or rather, I will request my sister, Mrs. K&ouml;rner to do so,
who is a favorite with her. I have never got into her good
graces, not being <i>prononc&eacute;e</i> enough for her taste, I believe.
A few words of suggestion from her, will perhaps influence
her to change your studies a little. She knows that
Lina has always loved you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Zo&euml;, looking rather doubtful however
about the result of this interference.</p>

<p>"Do you like history, Zo&euml;?" continued Mrs. Liebenhoff.</p>

<p>"I like to pick plums out of it, here and there, in the
shape of the rare characters of men and women and striking
events, but I hate accounts of wars and battles which make
so much of the history of the past, and in fact, I think
there is a great deal too much said about very stupid, uninteresting,
and very wicked people, whom I think our
Lord would have put quite in the back-ground in his estimation
had he known them," she answered.</p>

<p>"Yes, the chief thing which interests me in history, is
what is called its philosophy&mdash;the showing as it were, the
thread of God's Providence running through all time, with
the light of his loving care resting over and working with
the affairs of men, ever bringing good out of evil, and
causing all changes and revolutions, no less than the more
slow and silent weaving of the warp and woof of events
together, to tend slowly but surely to the accomplishment
of his benevolent and harmonious plan in creation. If a
historian aims at this as a chief end of his labor, and especially
if he recognizes in Christianity the great moral and
spiritual power which is to solve all the difficult problems
of humanity, so far as they can be solved in life, and to
bring light out of darkness, I am placed in sympathy with
him at once; but if he merely piles up masses of facts
without recognizing these truths, I may find his book a

<!--- vol 1 page 159 -->

useful granary to gather needful materials from, but the
man interests me but slightly, and I have not full trust in
his work."</p>

<p>"Have you any more moral to my story for my edification?"
said Zo&euml;, looking up archly at Mrs. Liebenhoff.
"Please give me the whole of it."</p>

<p>"I think you need it, for you are not converted yet to
my unpalatable doctrine, so I repeat: repress your imagination
until your other powers are strong in proportion to
the elevation and extent of its flight; for, Zo&euml;, we women
need to throw out every anchor that we have, to save us
from drifting into the whirlpools that would swallow us, or
upon the strands where we should bleach out our lives,
like the ghost-flower, and only in dying reflect the faintest
rays of the descending sun. For no Gospel is truer than
that she may be born in that securest of retreats, a home
in middle life in a rural district, under a father's eye apostolic
and yet fitted by his sagacity and purity to guide her,
with a mother (how can one speak worthily of her transcendent
worth?) gentle, pure, and loving&mdash;in the highest
sense simple, far-sighted, and wise, in the very centre of a
circle of brothers and sisters most kind, disinterested, and
affectionate, with but few incidents to vary life's serene
monotony, making but one pilgrimage into the high world
of conventionalism, affluence, and comparative luxury, and
that one relieved, ay immortalized to her mind and character
forever, by contact with exalted excellence, dignity,
high intelligence, and beauty&mdash;with a marriage of affection,
in which the most generous freedom allowed her is
only equaled by the joy with which every fresh development
of her powers is received; childless, it is true, but
this scarcely regarded as a want by one to whom quiet in
the inner life and the opportunity of unoccupied companionship
in all his pursuits with the beloved one, is so
indispensable; with friends and objects of interest sufficient
to employ, enrich, and beautify her life above the common

<!--- vol 1 page 160 -->

lot; and yet, Zo&euml;, <i>and yet</i> so much greater is the soul than
its accidents, so exacting has God made it, in at least the
feminine form, that, while it falls short of one good of its
own being, and from its out-look sees the majority of its
sex, wandering bereft and forlorn, miserable by their exposure
and ruined by their fall into sin, shame, and delusion
that, Niobe-like, at one time she is turned into stone and
anon the shrieks of the Pythoness and the wailings of the
prophets express for her all too feebly her sense of her
woe, until she sees that, under God, she is to be an instrument
of their relief and uprising, when there rushes
through her being such a full tide of bliss as is known only
to the elected of God. O Zo&euml;, trust not to the uncertain,
deceitful imagination, but labor, strive, pray for the strength
which is needed even more for the perils of its seasons of
joy than of its sorrows."</p>

<p>"And you never dream, madam, though from what you
say, I know it is your nature to do so?"</p>

<p>"Listen to my teaching and ask not for my practice, that
is your part, dear. It is hard to expect me to do both, and
you neither," said she, laughing.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Zo&euml;, "and you are one of the false preachers
who cry aloud and point for the people to go up the stony
hill-path, while they turn aside into the opposite flowery
one. O fie!"</p>

<p>"I will at least say this in justification of myself, my
little accuser, that through the whole year I do my best to
act up to my own rule, while spreading my life over the
thousand objects of care and interest which come within
the sphere of a woman's life whose husband lives for the
public weal, and I take only now and then a flight into the
beloved, fancy-world, though through all its toiling hours
and busy scenes come up visions of this same couch at
this luxurious time, when our few, fervid days of summer
give me a fitting excuse to shut the light out to the
point of mystery, and I lounge and revel in dream-land

<!--- vol 1 page 161 -->

for a brief time, as it is the thirst of my nature to do.
And you need not think that I have not my reward; for the
little grub which lieth patiently at the base of the earth-pyramid,
working out in silence, amid scorn and a sense
of degradation, but with patience and trust, the appointment
of its Maker, is rewarded at last with its beautiful
butterfly being. Slowly and tremblingly she creeps up
over one green leaf and orange flower to another, until at
last she reaches the summit of the shaft, when gladly she
opens her purple and starry wings to the light, and what is
so bright and so gladsome as she? For it is with no vain
presumption that I say it, that after a childhood weighed
down by unnatural mental anxiety and premature care, followed
by a stormy and perilous youth, at times nearly shipwrecked
among the floods, then scorched by central fires,
and anon withered and seared by the sterility of the arid
deserts of life, through all of which I strove to be faithful
and true, I am now, not rewarded, Heaven forgive me if I
ever, for a moment, conceived the idea of such ingratitude,
but inconceivably, immeasurably, unmeritedly blessed with
childhood, youth, and middle life in one, and through his
abundant aid who endowed me, I have the control of every
faculty of the nature he has given me."</p>

<p>"There comes Hilda!" said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"Good evening, madam," said she, as she entered.
"Pardon me if I interrupt you. The servant directed me
to your room."</p>

<p>"Welcome to <i>my</i> sanctum; you are already familiar to
my husband's, I believe."</p>

<p>"Yes, madam, I have that privilege. Is Mr. Liebenhoff
at home?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and here he is; come to give an account of
himself, I ween, for disobeying me. I ordered him to be
quiet as he is not very well; and here he dares to return
to me with the dust upon his feet of every street in the
city, to say nothing of what he gathers in the hovels he

<!--- vol 1 page 162 -->

visits. I shake off mine," said she, stamping as she stood
before him, "as a testimony against such undutifulness,
and give him a boxing into the bargain."</p>

<p>"That I can at least defend myself against," said he.
"But I will try and not be too savage towards the wife, lest
I should alarm and disgust these young marriageables with
the holy bonds."</p>

<p>"Marriageables! Heaven forbid for these eight or nine
years at least," said she. "Spare them as long as possible
from miserable servitude like mine. See my chains and be
pitiful towards me, ye tender young hearts," said she, catching
up a wreath of flowers and holding it up with mock
despair in her face, and then, quick as thought, throwing it
over her husband's neck and leading him along by it.</p>

<p>The girls laughed, and then said that as twilight was
deepening they must return home. After affectionate
adieux and repeated invitations to come again, they departed.</p>

<p>"How funny Mrs. Liebenhoff is," said Hilda. "She is
so different from what I thought her. O I shall like to
visit her. Let's go next week again."</p>

<p>"Yes, we will," said Zo&euml;. "But I like her for other reasons
than her fun." And she became silent and thoughtful,
and heeded but little the continual chatter of her
friend as they walked homewards.</p>

<p>"WE are to have a pic-nic to-morrow
in the woods at Elfdale, my husband;
will you accompany us?" said Mrs.
Liebenhoff, as they sat together in
the window of their library one
evening, "we wish to give our American friends a breath
of the delicious odor of our pine-woods, and a glimpse

<!--- vol 1 page 164 -->

of our country life at this halcyon season. You <i>will</i> go,
dear, will you not?"</p>

<p>"I cannot, I am sorry to say; I have much to do about
this church matter you know; our vacation comes soon, and
I wish to have all settled before that time. Go you and
enjoy yourself, and my play shall be by-and-by."</p>

<p>"And after that moving discourse of mine, you can find
it in your heart to tell me all this without a blush! I see
you are just like other sinners of the common clay of the
world. You agree that the preaching is all very good, and
you mean to repent and be converted&mdash;O yes, certainly,
nothing else, but not until you have committed the very last
sin, which seemeth good to the perverse nature within you.
Pray heaven, it may not then be too late to turn from the
evil of your ways," and she looked upon his pale face with
solicitude.</p>

<p>"What a crooked stick of a husband she has got, has
she not? I wonder how she happened to take him to lean
upon; does she not repent of her bargain, the little wife?"</p>

<p>"Too little crooked is the difficulty for this naughty
world; I thought I had proved that to your satisfaction in
my memorable sermon. Why, I do believe you have forgotten
it! How discouraging to be a preacher! But, as I
was saying, if you walk through life so erect, like a tall
white pine tree, you will blow over, or break off, or be torn
up by the roots in some unlucky gale or other."</p>

<p>"You are not a willow precisely; your sap has too much
exhilarating gas in it for that, for though you may droop
once in a while, before I can get across the room to comfort
you, ten to one, you have played some trick upon me,
and are ready to meet my condolence with a laugh in my
face."</p>

<p>"It is all out of sheer compassion, I assure you. You
have so many 'live vidders,' as Sam Waller calls them, and
forlorn elderly maidens to console, and tempted, endangered
young girls to keep out of harm's way, and young

<!--- vol 1 page 165 -->

men's haram-scarum ways to straighten, and old men's
bitternesses to sweeten, and the wounded, bruised, and
out-of-sorts generally to heal and set right; to say nothing
of being chief purveyor for the community at large in
their worldly affairs, that I long ago made up my mind to
resign all claim upon you."</p>

<p>"Who brought home that nice market-basket, this morning,
full of the delicacies of the season, to say nothing of a
pretty bouquet of flowers and a Cape of Good Hope shell
into the bargain? How unhappy I am to have such an
ungrateful wife!"</p>

<p>"O, of course you must eat something under all these
inflictions, else you might fail of strength, and flowers and
shells, and pictures, and such things, I am going to live
upon in the future; I don't believe in eating, we think too
much of creature comforts. Thank you, my dear husband,
for everything of beauty you give me, and they are not a
few; each leaf, petal, and full-blown flower, and tint of the
shell is suggestive to me and nourishes my higher life.
And as for pictures, they are my quartos and folios now-a-days."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you <i>will</i> grow willowy upon such ethereal
food. Pray put this doubtful nutriment, for the <i>corpus</i> at
least, between good, substantial slices of bread and butter,
by way of sandwiches, you know; I really cannot spare
you yet."</p>

<p>"Well, anything to please you; but don't be alarmed
about losing me, I am going to be like the yew tree, that
grows and grows until it seems to be past living, and you
are on the point of cutting it down as a dead incumbrance,
when lo! it makes a crook and out it shoots again all as fresh
and new as ever, and thus it does indefinitely. Don't you
see some new sprouts in my pericranium now?"</p>

<p>"Yes truly, but that is nothing new. You have been
growing younger ever since our marriage. I must tighten
the reins and disturb your happiness a little, or I shall

<!--- vol 1 page 166 -->

have upon my hands 'the child-wife' which Dickens writes
about. But it is bed-time, especially if you go into the
country to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Yes, tighten the reins, please do; I want more opportunity
of curvetting and prancing than you give me.
Wouldn't I show my paces?"</p>

<p>The next morning, bright and early, the little lady was
up, spreading bread with butter for sandwiches, cutting
cake, and collecting from her storehouse the various dainties
which northern women make a great point of accumulating
for special occasions, if not for daily use. To see
the generous provision she was making, one would incline
to dissent from her assertion that she was going to eschew
creature comforts; and her husband, as he passed her on
his way out, hinted as much, adding that the source of the
new shoots of the yew tree was no longer a mystery.</p>

<p>"A truce to your insinuations," said she; "Zo&euml; Carlan is
my especial charge to-day, and I am going to try to add
some pabulum to her physique, or she will go off some day
in cloud and vapor. She is the most dreamy little thing
ever inclosed by mortality. I thought in my zeal I could
make her common-sensible and contented with life in one
or two interviews; but no such thing. I believe I have so
far had exactly the contrary effect upon her, and that is
not the worst of it either, for she carries me back to my
foolish youth so completely by her great weird-like eyes,
looking over, as they do, into 'Borrooboola-gha' continually,
that ten to one, I shall find myself there with her,
careering over the desert upon my Arabian steed with
Abdallah by my side, telling me of his feats with his forty
thieves, and whispering of our evening rest on the oasis by
the side of the fountain, under the cocoa-nut palm-tree
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whist! the little wife, what is she talking about?" said
he, stooping towards her and raising her laughing face
to his.</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 167 -->

<p>"O just giving you a hint that I am a part of your parish
that needs looking after a little as well as the rest. Good-by,"
said she, tying on her bonnet, and taking her basket
on her arm. "I told Zo&euml; I would call for her on my way
to the public conveyance. If we don't return before midnight
you may know that we have dissolved into thin air,
and to-morrow morning when you visit your favorite Calacanthus
you will find me there before you, in the shape of
a heavy dew. Until then, adieu."</p>

<p>Arrived at the carriage-station, they found Mrs. K&ouml;rner
and her children, Miss Dahl and Miss Meldan, friends of
hers, the two American young ladies, Miss Holberg and
Mrs. Castonio, a favorite friend of Mrs. Liebenhoff, who,
with Zo&euml;, Hilda, and herself, including baskets of every
shape and size, bursting with refreshments, filled to somewhat
more than the point of comfort the well-sized vehicle.</p>

<p>Just as they were leaving the city, Mr. K&ouml;rner's bright
face appeared at the window.</p>

<p>"Here you all are I perceive. Success to you! Good-by,
darling," said he to the youngest, who, with outstretched
arms, was petitioning for his attention.</p>

<p>"You will come, dear, will you not towards evening?"
said his wife.</p>

<p>"If I can; but don't expect me too confidently, I have
so much to do. Fare ye well," said he, kissing his hand
to them as they drove away.</p>

<p>"Widows indeed, if not widows in name two-thirds and
a half of the time!" said Mrs. K&ouml;rner. "I have got a plan
for making a general conflagration of the notaries' offices in
the city. Will you each turn out with your torch on the
occasion, my friends? The signal shall be: 'Down with
business; up with reasonable and religious good works.' "</p>

<p>"You are fortunate if you have no religionists who put
a technical meaning to that term," said Jenny Hale, "and
cover with opprobrium, as they do in my country, the sect
to which I belong, for believing in their importance."

<!--- vol 1 page 168 -->

<p>"What do they believe in?" said Miss Dahl, "bad ones?
Then their cry would be&mdash;Down with Odin; up with
Loken?"</p>

<p>"I must do them the justice to say," said Jenny, "that
they would not own to that watchword, but that is really the
practical effect upon our countrymen. Loken is let loose
in every direction, as every morning newspaper shows in
black and white, and I attribute his rampancy to the dominant
church and self-styled evangelists keeping him before
the people so continually in their sermons, putting him too
nearly on an equality with 'our Father in heaven,' horrible
to say! and especially insisting upon it that we are all his
subjects&mdash;that we are made so that we must obey him
whether or no, unless a miracle is wrought upon us to prevent
it&mdash;and that our more than probable destiny through
eternity is to burn up forever, without consuming, in the
bottomless pit. Now, if that would not have the effect to
exalt his pride, his expectations, and increase his power
over us, if his black majesty <i>really does exist</i>, at the same
time that it tended to make us powerless against his arts,
I leave it to the true, simple-minded, sensible and devout,
to determine."</p>

<p>"Come," said Theresa, "I put my veto upon this doctrinal
talk; I have too much of it at home; I am tired of
the very sound of anything that smacks in the least of Calvinistic
dogmas. It is blasphemy in the worst sense, their
Druidical belief. 'Belay that,' as the sailor said to Father
Taylor, in his chapel, when he was dealing it out in a
somewhat mild form on a Sunday, 'give us something
about Napoleon Bonaparte,' or anything else as opposite as
possible."</p>

<p>After a pleasant drive of five miles, the party arrived at
the wood where they were to encamp for the day. It was
composed principally of pines, hemlocks, and firs, although
beeches, oaks, and other forest trees were intermingled,
forming a full and grateful shade from the fervid heat of

<!--- vol 1 page 169 -->

the sun. For his summer's reign in this northern latitude,
though short, is powerful, and all the more yielded to by
the inhabitants from being so distinct from the nature of
his sway at other seasons of the year.</p>

<p>There they met a party of their country friends, and
after the first friendly greetings, the chief object seemed
to be for each one to make herself or himself as comfortable
and happy as possible. Mr. and Mrs. Pendleton soon
arrived in a britzska.</p>

<p>"What a lovely spot!" said she, as she alighted. "These
fragrant pines, and this assembled group, with their costumes
fitted for the occasion, remind me so much of home,
only with this important difference, I did not, as is my custom
there, get up at four o'clock in the morning to prepare
for it."</p>

<p>"Veterans in the service of society always get their reward
if they wait long enough," said Jenny Hale. "Please
make the most of this respite from your long campaign in
the warfare between <i>chicken-salad</i> and <i>chopsticks</i>, your
<i>flowers</i> and the <i>Floras</i>, to say nothing of <i>ice-cream</i> and
<i>screamers</i> in the shape of all the children in the neighborhood."</p>

<p>"O horrible!" said Theresa. "Save us from such detestable
puns, I beseech you."</p>

<p>"Bad enough to be good, are they not? But you should
kindly encourage my first attempt. I will seat myself by
Miss Dahl. She will have a fellow-feeling for me. She
must have made a beginning sometime though she shows
such facility now in this species of wit."</p>

<p>"What a beautiful piece of embroidery that is you are
working!" said Mrs. Liebenhoff to Miss Meldan.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a traveling-bag for a young friend, who is to
be married soon; I am willing, so far, to weave a thread
into the destiny of the fair creature's future. Farther than
in some such way, I shrink from going."</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 170 -->

<p>"Then you don't believe in match-making any more
than I do," said Mrs. Liebenhoff.</p>

<p>"No indeed, I have seen too much trouble from such
sources to attempt so dangerous an enterprise. Let each
couple pair themselves, I say."</p>

<p>"No one but the Highest is equal to it in my opinion.
He who has tempered each of his children according to
his own sense of beauty and fitness, alone knows the adaptation
of one to the other," said Mrs. Liebenhoff.</p>

<p>"Then you believe that matches are made in heaven?"
said Theresa.</p>

<p>"All true marriages are," said she. "All might be in
the best sense if we would have it so, but there is great
infidelity on this point as well as everything else connected
with our highest life."</p>

<p>"How is a body to know?" said Theresa, "if her marriage
is ordained? I desire light upon this subject, for I
have a feeling that I am fated to be dreadfully taken in, in
this awful business. The very thought of it makes me
frantic. What is your rule for knowing? Do you find it
written in the Bible, chapter and verse? or are you impressed,
as the spiritualists say? Do tell me, for pity
sake."</p>

<p>"I have no rule for any one but myself. Mine worked
well for me, but it might not for you; so you don't get it
with all your urgency. That is my own secret, but you
cannot convince me that my marriage was not ordained
above. There are quite too many rules of life in the world
and too little of acting up to the highest <i>spirit</i> of our nature
and God's requisition. The great thing is to reach an
elevated plane of thought and feeling, and then most of
the perplexities of life would be solved. But where is
Zo&euml;?"</p>

<p>"Wandering off alone," said Hilda; "shall I follow and
make her return?"</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 171 -->

<p>"No," said Mrs. Liebenhoff, "I will walk with her a
few minutes."</p>

<p>She found her standing perfectly still, looking at a large
spider's web, which was woven from branch to branch on
the dead limb of a tree above her head.</p>

<p>She started on seeing Mrs. Liebenhoff, but was reassured
on finding it to be no other than her friend.</p>

<p>"What strange creatures insects are!" said she. "They
seem to me a sort of revelators, if I may so speak, of our
fortunes, and in consequence, impress me with a kind of
awe."</p>

<p>"And what does 'Mrs. Hairy-leg spinner' deign to announce
to you of your experience or destiny? That you
are to be very industrious and practical; that you are to
build your own house, and keep the larder well provided?"</p>

<p>"O no; but, that as she sits solitary and despised in the
centre of her world, so am I alone and peculiar in the
sphere in which I am thrown; and yet God alone knows
if we are not equally with others living truly according to
his will."</p>

<p>"I think, dear, if the spider could speak, she would tell
you that you informed her of that fact quite as much as
she you. However I am not quite free from superstition,
as it would be called, about a thousand such things. I
have not made up my mind about them, and perhaps never
shall in this world at least; for, in a universe of infinity,
how can finite beings expect to know everything? Much
must necessarily be indefinite, and here comes in our glad
privilege of trust, faith in God and his Providence, which
is much better than going to spiders to have your fortune
told. And, Zo&euml; my love, pray combat this idea which I
see is fixing itself in your mind that you are peculiar. It
is pernicious every way. You will, through it, grow morbid,
unnatural, and unhappy. I don't like <i>peculiar</i> people,
they are so self-conscious and disagreeable. Come, let us
return to the company."</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 172 -->

<p>"I dislike to, they stare at me so; I look so different from
them one would think I was an ourang-outang, to see them
gaze upon me. It is as much as I can do to prevent playing
some odd trick or other when their eyes are all upon
me. And I must tell you that one sunny day, just at the
opening of spring, Hilda and I walked to the outskirts of
the city, and while she ran aside for some purpose, I sat
down on a stone to wait for her. A group of children
gathered around me, and there they stood with staring eyes
and open mouths. I had just eaten an orange and had cut
the rind round into strips. I put one of them to my eye
for a quizzing-glass and grinned at them with all my might.
You would have laughed to see them run. 'It is the queen
of the dark Elves,' said they, 'run, run, or she will carry
us into her kingdom under ground, where we never shall
see our mothers again!' I thought Hilda would have died
laughing, when she returned just in time to witness the
fun. She actually rolled upon the ground, and she had
her best pelisse on too."</p>

<p>"Well, we are never satisfied in this life," said Mrs.
Liebenhoff. "It would be a great convenience to me to
have a more distinct character than I have to my face; then
I should not, so often as I do, have the trouble of telling
my name. To my butcher, my baker, my grocer, and the
shopman, I repeat it over and over again, when I direct
packages to be sent to me. Latterly, I have formed the
habit of saying, when I enter the presence of persons that
I have not seen for the last six weeks, 'Mrs. Liebenhoff,
ladies, how are you?' and to gentlemen, who have sat at
my board and received, with the utmost graciousness, everything
in the way of hospitality I can grant them, when they
meet me abroad, a bare portrait, without the setting of my
house, and to my cordial greeting, answer, with an indifferent
look, 'You have the advantage of me, madam: I don't
recognize you,' I simply say, 'O, ay; I suppose so,' and
pass on."</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 173 -->

<p>"I should have known you, after my first introduction,
if I had met you in Timbuctoo," said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it dear, simply because you have
another style of measurement than the superficial one in
vogue. But here is a new arrival."</p>

<p>"Do you know all these people?" said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"Yes, more or less, enough to bow to them, though
some of them would not say the same of me for reasons
aforesaid. That full-faced gentleman is Mr. Calthrop. I
have called at his house when riding into the country with
mutual friends; I just bowed to him and he looked wonderingly
at me, as much as to say, 'Who is that common-looking
woman? She could not have bowed to me.'
However, that is his affair, not mine. It was proper that I
should be civil to one whose hospitality I had received."</p>

<p>"Who is that sweet-looking woman near him, talking
with animation to Miss Meldan?"</p>

<p>"It is his wife, simple, artistic, and loving. They rise
each morning after a twelve years' marriage to a prolonged
honeymoon, and as they wander, hand in hand, around their
beautiful grounds, they drink in with appreciating eyes the
beauties of shrub, tree, cloud, sunlight and shadow, and
thank the good Giver of their varied blessings, with pious
and grateful hearts. If they are in fault, it is that blessed
with wealth, culture and health, they feel too little their
obligation to return in the direction of their fellow-men the
benefits which flow to them from God. She says she feels
nearer to Him through communing with nature than
through humanity. It may be so; we need to bathe our
spirits in the silence, solemnity, and loveliness of its beautiful
scenes; yet it should be but at intervals, only to return
more fresh and enthusiastic, to labor for the world's good;
for only in proportion as we do our full part towards its
renewal and advancement, are we saved when in our retirement
from an aimless dilettantism, or a selfish, or perverted
life. In the very Eden in which we have thought

<!--- vol 1 page 174 -->

to ensconce ourselves away from all the defilements of life,
shoots out the serpent-head of evil, and alas! his trail winds
itself gradually through its holiest works, showing that
humanity in ourselves, no less than in our kind, is greater
than nature, and only as we grasp the idea of the height
and depth of its vastness, and are inspired to labor for its
full manifestation by removing from it the crust of selfishness
and wrong, and every species of narrowness, can we
have a just feeling of self-satisfaction and be saved from our
most dangerous enemies, our unoccupied selves."</p>

<p>"And who is the tall gentleman with the full brow, talking
with Mrs. Petersen?"</p>

<p>"It is Mr. Keutsch, an influential man at court."</p>

<p>"I observed he looked as if he expected you would
greet him farther than by a passing bow. Do you not know
him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he has been at our house, but I shall not trust to
his memory to recollect me. My bow was for his speaking
manly and courageous words for the independence of
Schleswig Holstein, which so few of our noblemen dare to
do; I honor him for that."</p>

<p>"Who is that gentleman walking with Miss Carden?"</p>

<p>"It is Mr. Henshom. Don't they enjoy dissecting the
last new literature and philosophy together? and they do it
in pretty good style too, only that they are too minute in their
criticisms to suit me. My scissors, which I use in that
line, are not over-sharp, for I have an instinctive fear of
damaging the <i>interior spirit</i> of life and its simple expression
by cutting and hacking right and left, as some do.
When I find <i>that</i> to suit me, I am rather blunt in my perception
of inferior faults. Many a young Miss in her
teens has overthrown and ridden right over me, when
mounted upon her exegetical pony and running a tilt
against the religion, learning, science, and art of the past
and present times, besides crowning one author with immortelles
and completely extinguishing another in the

<!--- vol 1 page 175 -->

same breath. I sometimes amble along with my moderately-paced
nag for a brief moment or two, until I see what
a fearful campaign it is going to be, when I turn aside
quietly into the first green wood near, which offers a slight
but refreshing illusion to the senses, and then I let the
poor, mortified animal browse a little before I return home
to shut her up in the stable until the good God relieves us
from the sharp perils of these dangerous times, where
nothing is sacred enough to escape being picked to pieces
by our critics."</p>

<p>"Do they visit you?"</p>

<p>"O yes, Miss Carden is my friend, earnest, intelligent,
and religious. She only needs to see more clearly that
the study of books is not the sole enlightenment of life,
but that when one has accumulated such stores of knowledge
as she has, and acquired her discipline of mind, that
if there is a different sphere from any which she has yet
occupied, open for her, it is the very one most assuredly
which her soul needs, in which to bring up its flagging,
more passive power, so to speak, and lay to its proper level
the watchful, critical, exacting intellect.</p>

<p>"As for the gentleman, we know each other&mdash;no we
don't&mdash;and yes we do again. Not so well, however, as if
he were not born in the last century, and I quite far along
in the present."</p>

<p>"O you jest, madam!"</p>

<p>"No, he is nearly a hundred, that is in his opinions,
which are conservative to the point of the admiration of all
staid old nobles and dowagers, who look very suspiciously
upon any quickstep in the march of progress. Still I am
undecided again. What has come over me as well as himself?
He has been speculating theologically and philosophically,
and his ancient basis is a little shaken. I see it
in his face, his manner, and his curt style of answering the
most simple and innocent questions, as much as to say,
'You are going to look me through, are you? You don't

<!--- vol 1 page 176 -->

seize upon my secrets.' I wonder if when he goes to his
home far away, he will sit down by his beloved mother and
say, 'you taught me to be good when I was a little boy, and
the same instructions, hallowed as they are by every
thought and memory of you, dearest mother, stand me in
good stead in my manhood; but as my mind grows, there
are opening upon me vistas through which I look, half
fearful and half joyful and dimly discern, as I think, higher
truths than have been familiar to me of yore, in the distance&mdash;and
now, my best friend, tremble not for your son,
if with prayer, with the Scripture, and your counsels to
guide me, I venture into what may seem to you dangerous
paths; for, through Christ, I trust to be guided safely to
the light and seize, through a high conviction, upon these
glorious verities, and bear them as trophies of my soul's
warfare with intellectual blindness and error to your feet,
my mother; when together we will bless God for that great
good of our being, a pure, unadulterated conception of
Christianity.' In this enterprise may heaven speed you,
my old, middle-aged, young friend."</p>

<p>"How bright and well Mrs. Petersen looks to-day! I
wish she liked me; I think I should love her so much,"
said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"You must speak to her frankly and cordially when you
meet her, my dear. You do not often see her, and then
you are so shy that she has no opportunity of knowing you,
occupied as she is with her children and many other objects
of interest. But her brightness and willing sacrifices
for the pleasure of her friends, are not the true gauge
by which to measure her physical vigor or her soul's
equanimity, for she has had a great sorrow and has heavy
cares; and though, to the superficial eye, she may seem
to pass through them unscathed, yet there are abysses in
our nature which, young as you are, Zo&euml;, you are fast
learning, may be stirred to their deepest and blackest extreme,
and yet convey no echo of the hoarse and fearful

<!--- vol 1 page 177 -->

roar, which rises and swells and subsides in the hearing
only of the Infinite, revealing to mortals the tumult below
only by the brighter rainbow hung over the spray of its
floods. What matters it if no human sympathy can pour
oil upon the troubled waters to smooth them to peacefulness,
if through their commotion comes all the more gratefully
the still small voice of God, our Father, whispering
of rest and reward in that world where 'there is no more
sea?' But here is Miss Holberg."</p>

<p>"I come to share your bank with you if you will
allow your t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te to be broken in upon, Mrs. Liebenhoff."</p>

<p>"O certainly, with all pleasure. Is it not a pretty
tableau opposite&mdash;the ladies with their fanciful costume,
and the children with their heads wreathed with leaves,
dancing on the green?"</p>

<p>"To say nothing of the grave relief to the butterfly scene
which the gentlemen present," said Miss Holberg.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I am falling mightily in love with women in
these days. They seem beautiful to me in every way, and
I have many, many questionings with myself about their
position in society as it is."</p>

<p>"Unfortunate for me to come upon you in this particular
mood of yours, as it is of one of the other sex I wished
to speak to you. I hear you are taking lessons, in one of
the oriental tongues, of a Hungarian Jew. Does he speak
the German language correctly, think you? We wish for
a teacher in our school."</p>

<p>"Yes, so far as my ear informs me, he does; besides,
his character inspires me with so much confidence that I
do not think he would attempt what he cannot do very well;
and it has been his chief medium of intercourse with his
countrymen since childhood."</p>

<p>"Is he married?"</p>

<p>"No, he has lived too busy and turbulent a life for such
quiet happiness. From his student life, he entered heart

<!--- vol 1 page 178 -->

and soul into the Hungarian revolution, from which he has
borne away some honorable scars."</p>

<p>"Does he know Kossuth?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he is his intimate friend and profound admirer.
He says, rising as he does so, and with emphatic tone, that
he is the noblest being on the face of the earth. He journeyed
at an inclement season, over a long and tedious way,
to apprise him of the traitorous designs of G&ouml;rgei, gathered
from his own observation, and begged him, for the sake of
Hungary, to concentrate the power of the kingdom more
in himself. But Kossuth, true to his Christian and republican
principles, refused to appropriate to his own person
a dignity and rule which, to his high ideal, was inconsistent
with strict justice to his compatriots."</p>

<p>"And so Hungary fell! I think he had better have been
a little more commonplace and sensible, and done what
most generals would not have hesitated to do in his place."</p>

<p>"So Mr. Se&uuml;ll thinks under the circumstances. But I
do not; and the world will yet see that, as there is a Supreme
Arbiter above, such unflinching devotion to a high
sentiment, though apparently it may result in disaster at
the time, will bring about in the end a higher good than
any that could be gained by a most conscientious departure
from it."</p>

<p>"Well, we shall see. There is not much evidence of
it as yet; but to return&mdash;how old is the gentleman? for unmarried
and young, are a combination that would shock
Miss Ingemann in a German teacher of young ladies."</p>

<p>"O anywhere between five and five thousand! the latter
age I am inclined to think. He must have sojourned with
Abraham, though I am sorry to say he is not quite his equal
in faith; he is twin brother to Joseph, as he shows in
various ways. Moses and he were special friends, though
he would have had too much self-possession to have broken
the two tables in a passion. Pity he had not intrusted
them to him in coming down from the Mount. He was

<!--- vol 1 page 179 -->

prime minister of David, and privy counselor to Solomon;
but in the reign of Hezekiah he broke out in a new place
as Isaiah, and I will just add that he says that he did not
exactly describe our Saviour in his fifty-third chapter.
That had special reference to the Jews in their captivity;
but this he knew through his prophetic foresight that something
very great and good was to happen to the world, and
that it came in Christ and his religion."</p>

<p>"What form did he assume next?"</p>

<p>"That of Jeremiah, and uttered his memorable Lamentations
over Jerusalem. Next he was in gilded captivity
with Daniel, till, for his disobedience to the wicked commands
of the king, he was thrown into the den of lions;
but being master of the magnetic art he put them to sleep,
and was taken out the next morning unscathed, to be made
more of at court than ever."</p>

<p>"What next?"</p>

<p>"He was John the Baptist, and prepared the way for the
coming of our Saviour; which mission accomplished, he
magnanimously confessed the superiority of the Messiah
to himself, and was, you know, put to death by Herod for
his moral boldness in reproving him for his sin. Soon
after this he appeared again on the earth in the form of a
little Jewish boy. He was early left an orphan and subjected
to the cruel guardianship of a miserly Pharisaical
grandfather; was educated first for a rabbi, and was deep-dyed
in the superstitions of the Talmud, but broke loose
from the bondage only to fall in the course of ages into the
no less Gentile superstition of Calvinism, through which
'wild woods' he groped his way to the light partly by the
aid of German theology and philosophy, but much more
through the pure truth of the New Testament, till after all
his peregrinations and transformations he stands forth to
the world as John the Baptist again, but of the more
spiritualized and glorified dispensation of our Lord. In
short, my friend, he is the Wandering Jew <i>par excellence</i>,

<!--- vol 1 page 180 -->

not the vulgar, stale idea of one so much written about,
who scoffed at our Saviour on his way to the cross and was
condemned to an everlasting life on earth as his punishment,
but the true, sublime, all-suffering, all-sympathizing,
all-conquering, and at last purified and Christianized
Israelite, who is to bring the millions of his countrymen
wherever they may be scattered and peeled and ground
to the dust into the light, joy, peace, and full satisfaction
of Christ's kingdom. I doubt whether his eye is yet
opened to the view of his glorious destiny; but I know it,
and rejoice that it is so. Do you not think I am fortunate
in the choice of my teacher?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you can bear up under such a marvelous history
and experience, but I fear that he would set the girls
crazy, especially Zo&euml; here. He would just suit her
fancy, but I should fear for her sanity under his administration."</p>

<p>"O do engage him, Miss Holberg! I know I should
learn of him faster than ever before. Try me, please,"
said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"I think you had better," said Mrs. Liebenhoff. "I
have noticed that he has a very father-Abrahamic way with
young girls, and a distinguishing characteristic of his is
moral-force, and power of inspiring his pupils with the
same, which, with his fidelity, and last, but not least, his
very natural and true method of instruction in the languages,
insure him great success."</p>

<p>"I will tell Miss Ingemann, and she must do as she
pleases; but I must say I have some misgivings with regard
to some foolish little heads," said she, pressing Zo&euml;'s to
her face affectionately.</p>

<p>"Come," said Mrs. Castonio, running towards them,
"you have given me no opportunity of chatting with you
to-day, and now we are going to partake of our refreshments."</p>

<p>"Take a turn through this little grove with me first,"

<!--- vol 1 page 181 -->

said Mrs. Liebenhoff; and arm in arm they threaded their
way through the fragrant pine wood.</p>

<p>"I have something to tell you in return for your confidence.
I, too, am writing a book as well as yourself,"
said she.</p>

<p>"O, I am so glad," said Mrs. Castonio; "now we are
more than ever sisters, having a like interest to occupy us.
Do you love to write?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a great pleasure as well as relief; but the
publication is the worst of it. Awful, is it not, to see fragments
of one's most precious self, flying hither and thither,
and gossiped over and laughed at and picked to pieces
by the self-styled wise?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but one always has the hope of doing good and
conferring pleasure, and that compensates for such annoyances."</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly; and I have made up my mind to put
the finishing touch to the salvation of mankind by my Tale;
that and the Bible are to be <i>the</i> books henceforward. None
of my friends seem to believe it; they speak of it like any
other common work, G&ouml;ethe's, Schiller's, Oelenschlager's,
etc. Only to think of such presumption! But never
mind, that makes no difference. We shall see what we
shall see;" and they laughed at her ambitious designs upon
immortality.</p>

<p>There was much merriment over the multiform repast,
especially the Gammel cheese made among the mountains.
Mrs. Pendleton liked it, and resolved to carry some home
on her return; while Theresa said it was hateful, from the
strong taste of the yellow flower of which the cows ate
abundantly, in the season of its manufacture, and which
imparted its flavor to the milk; and as for carrying it home,
she should not permit it to go on board ship, lest some
Nipon, or Loken, or the king of the dark Elves, or some
other one of their heathen deities or sprites, should smuggle
himself into it and sink them all in the deep.</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 182 -->

<p>At the beautiful hour of twilight they turned their faces
homewards, with many expressions of thanks and goodwill
to those who had contributed to their enjoyment by
their assiduous attentions, and as the shades deepened,
they sank into the silence and thoughtfulness which so
well befits this holiest season of the day, the dividing line
between busy labor and anxious care, and the rest and
hush of quiet, holy evening.</p>

<p>A few days after the event of the pic-nic, a group of the
pupils of Miss Ingemann's school were together in one of
the recitation rooms, from which their new German teacher
had just departed, leaving them at leisure for the rest of
the afternoon.</p>

<p>"Have we not caught a Tartar now?" said Adelgunda
Heiliger, who was given somewhat to indolence. "We
shall have to tread the exact line with him I see, or there
is no knowing what will come to pass. Dearee-me, where
is my book? It frightens me to think how I shall have to
study to come up to his high ideas of what can be done."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Freya, "and the cool way in which he says,
'you will read so far for the next lesson, and in six more
you will have finished this; and in three months you will
be able to do so and so,' is quite admirable for simple
maidens to behold, it actually takes away my breath to
think what a race in learning we are to run, to say nothing
of my neck's aching at gazing upwards at such a mountainous
height of superiority. A Tartar! say you, why he
is Hercules himself, only instead of a club he wields the
vocabularies of all the languages which scattered the
people at the tower of Babel."</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 184 -->

<p>"Nonsense,' said Rinda. 'The idea of trying to make
a hero of nothing but a despised Jew. I wonder that Miss
Ingemann should employ such a person. I do not think
my papa will wish me to take lessons of him. He is very
particular about my associates in every respect."</p>

<p>"A <i>despised Jew!</i>" said Zo&euml;; "how strange to speak
so contemptuously of that nation of which the most perfect
being that ever walked the earth&mdash;our adorable Lord&mdash;was
one, to say nothing of lawgivers, prophets, and apostles,
who gave glory to the race! I don't understand it."</p>

<p>"Did not the Jews crucify Jesus, and don't they deserve
all the contempt and punishment that can be heaped upon
them?" rejoined Rinda, in a coarse and angry tone.</p>

<p>"Our Saviour said, 'Father, forgive them, for they know
not what they do,' before he died, and even while suffering
the death-agony; and it is not being much like him for
men to harbor revenge and heap obloquy upon them
<i>eighteen hundred years</i> after they committed the deed,"
said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"Jew, or Christian, or Hottentot, I care not," said Hilda,
"he is a splendid fellow. His forehead, eyes, and mouth
are quite faultless. His nose, to be sure, might be chiseled
a little more like Apollo's and not suffer in appearance."</p>

<p>"That is the remnant of the Jews' stiff-neckedness. It
comes out in this shape, you may depend upon it," said
Zo&euml;. "Cosmopolitan as Mrs. Liebenhoff says he is in his
sympathies, attainments, and power of adaptation to different
circumstances, he can't surmount the strange prepossession
the race have for that peculiar nose. For the rest, I
have seen many pictures of the Christ, with a much lower
ideal of the high-toned and spiritual than a copy of
his face, when illuminated by its best expression, would
present."</p>

<p>"You put me out of patience, talking in this style. You
will be falling in love with him next, Hilda Strophel," said
Rinda Brandt.</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 185 -->

<p>"I look like marrying Father
Abraham and the patriarchs downwards,
don't I? said she, dancing
around the room with great glee.
"No, I am going to wed a North
American Indian and live on a bluff,
such as I read of at Mrs. Pendleton's,
overlooking the prairies, with
the sparkling rivers running through
them like silvery threads; with lakes
gleaming like diamonds in the desert;
with oak openings here and
there on their borders; and the
rank prairie grass waving, and
thousands of gold and crimson
flowers shining in the sunlight,
through which sweep the herds of the terrible buffalo, and
anon troops of mustangs make the welkin ring with the

<!--- vol 1 page 186 -->

sound of their galloping hoofs, and their neighings and
snortings."</p>

<p>"I suspect you are too '<i>loud</i> a thinker,' dear Hilda, to
suit precisely the young brave by your side," said Zo&euml;. "<i>I</i>
should fall into his own mood more naturally. As we sat
dreaming and gazing at the shadows of the passing clouds,
or the flocks of wild pigeons, or the herds of deer, or mayhap
were startled by the young Chippewa warrior flying
across the plain on his way to fight with the Sioux, he
would utter in bass the guttural <i>ugh</i>, and I in softer tenor
would echo <i>a&mdash;ugh</i>, and then sink into silence and reverie
again; and when 'the chambers of our imagery' were filled
to overflowing, we would speak out of our hearts, one after
the other."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hilda, "he would say to you, 'O Zo&euml;, life,
with the drooping eye and raven feathered hair! I have stolen
you from the bondage in which you were inclosed, to dwell
with me upon the wilderness prairie; and when I have,
with my eagle eye marked the young bison for prey and
dragged him as conqueror at my saddle-bow to my wigwam,
then, my life, you shall have your right, and cook for your
brave the tender flesh which is to strengthen him for the
conflict again.' "</p>

<p>"And I will answer," said Zo&euml;, " 'Yes, my brave 'Eagle
Plume,' joyfully will I share with you the toils of your way,
and I will open the tender young corn from its sheath, and
its sweet kernel shall delight and nourish your soul. And
when together we have cared for the field and the wigwam,
will we mount&mdash;you, your noblest wild horse; and I, my
fleetest of mules, and the wind shall sigh after us as we
leave it in the rear; and the hours shall speed to their
swiftest the coursers of the sun, and yet lag behind; and
the tempest shall in vain follow after us with its fury, for
we will outspeed them all. And when we reach the bluff,
I will descend from my daughter of the wild ass and mustang,
who shall graze by my side, and I will weave with the

<!--- vol 1 page 187 -->

quills of the porcupine, the beautiful moccasin, while you
scour the forest and prairie again for our winter's supply.
And when, weary and drooping, you return to me, with no
trophies it may be, to lay at my feet, then sweeter than the
music of the birds of the forest, tenderer than the hush of
the evening twilight, shall my voice be in soothing you to
rest; or again more inspiring than the breeze from the
north, telling you to test your fortunes again.' "</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," said Hilda: "I could do all that as well as
you. Give me the Indian, and you take the Jew. I think
you are the very one foreordained for our teacher."</p>

<p>"He would not think so," said Zo&euml;, "for he would have
to hang his harp upon the willow again and sprinkle ashes
upon his head anew, and wail for Zo&euml; as well as Zion.
No, no, I never shall marry."</p>

<p>"What absurdities are you dealing out?" said Rinda.
"I should think you were both moonstruck. I declare I
will tell Miss Ingemann if you don't hush."</p>

<p>"Come," said Hilda, "let us go to Mrs. Liebenhoff's.
You know she wished us to do so before the arrival of her
friends from Iceland, and this is the last opportunity we
shall have. You go first, Zo&euml;, please, while I finish practising
my music lesson, and then I will follow you. I know
you will be glad of a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with her."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; hastened to the parsonage.</p>

<p>"Please to walk into 'my ladies' chamber,' " said Mrs.
Liebenhoff from the window, as she ascended the steps and
entered the room. "How are you, dear? you look pale."</p>

<p>"I am not very well: we are pressing on with our studies
very fast, as we have entered upon the last half of the
term, and I am tired of them&mdash;that is all. Miss Ingemann
would think it laziness and want of interest if I complained,
so I say nothing."</p>

<p>"Did Mrs. K&ouml;rner speak to Miss Ingemann with regard
to changing the study of algebra for some other more
congenial to the character of your mind?"</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 188 -->

<p>"No, ma'am, I requested her not to. The fact is, my
pride has been aroused of late by finding that my teacher
was making up her mind that my fit destiny was to be a
cook, as she found accidentally that I had some native skill
in that way, which, added to a little care and patience,
made me successful in preparing a few trifles for breakfast
and dessert, and I was determined to show her that I could
do something in the line of her mathematical exactness;
so that algebra, geometry and I go into a pitched battle
every day."</p>

<p>"Which is the victor?"</p>

<p>"O the Chaldean and Arabian of course; how could it
be otherwise, seeing that I never was made to fight with a
parcel of ciphers and circles and triangles! Let them be
conquered by those who need them; I do not. I feel that
my warfare&mdash;if I have any&mdash;is to be a moral one, with
the evils of the world, and, therefore, I must furnish myself
with moral weapons." And her face began to assume
the rapt and contemplative expression common to it in
repose&mdash;"but (rousing herself,) I was determined to show
Miss Ingemann that I could do something besides cook,"
said she, contemptuously.</p>

<p>"The culinary art is by no means to be despised," said
Mrs. Liebenhoff, "for on that depends very much our
soundness of body, and through that, our health of mind.
Besides, in middle life at least, and I will say in every station,
no one can be a lady&mdash;and that in my view, comprehends
very much, even a high Christian character, with its
troop of sister virtues; a culture in every direction, commensurate
with our opportunities; and manners, the natural
expression of a mind thus enlightened and a soul thus enriched;&mdash;I
repeat, no one can be a lady who has not the self-possession
and grace which a command of the general principles,
if not of all the particularities of her menage gives
her. Without this power, the exigencies of life may haply
drag her down from a queenly height of elegance, delicacy,

<!--- vol 1 page 189 -->

artistic taste, and a soft and fascinating amiability, to the
frantic perplexity of a weakling who has lost her household
gods; to the coarse scolding of a shrew; to the
unseemly capacity of a drudge, too ignorant to fill the
unwonted station without complete absorption in this necessary
but second-rate department of life; or to the querulous
complainings of a grown up baby, whose wedded life,
opening as it did with flowers, music, and poetry, may,
through her own or her parents' neglect, end in dingy ugliness,
vice, or insanity. No, Zo&euml;, despise no useful capacity,
my child, however humble."</p>

<p>"But one does not wish to be praised for such things,"
said she.</p>

<p>"I don't object," said Mrs. Liebenhoff, "though I crave
the privilege of modifying the kind compliments of my
friends, for when they tell me, as they sometimes do, 'you
make the best cake and pastry in the city;' then I say to
myself, 'behold your reward for struggling with your
dreamy and indolent temperament, which would have led
you to lie hour after hour, with your head resting upon
your hand, looking at a Sybil.' "</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"Longing to be one, and yet squandering the time and
neglecting the means which would give you more than her
mysterious power. Depend upon it, a common-sensible,
practical, Christian woman, in the best and highest sense,
is a great deal better and a more agreeable personage than
any such one-sided peculiarity."</p>

<p>"There you are again."</p>

<p>"I am as bad as Miss Ingemann, am I not?"</p>

<p>"O no, no, ma'am. I always feel when with her&mdash;here
is a person entirely exempt from the frailties and sins of
humanity, and of course she can have no sympathy with
poor, weak, guilty me. Let me hide myself from her faultlessness
and intolerance of wrong. And so I do as much as
I can. But with you I feel encouraged and inspired, and if

<!--- vol 1 page 190 -->

I had been very, very naughty I could lay my forehead
upon your shoulder and tell you all that I had done, and
that as you forgave me when I was contrite and sad, so
also would I hope for mercy from our Father in heaven;"
and her head drooped and her voice sank into the lowest
whisper of pensiveness.</p>

<p>"Come, my little penitent, we will wait till you sin more
than I know of before I become your father confessor.
You shall be shriven, however, when that time arrives, I
will warrant, so don't be despairing. Let us go into the
garden."</p>

<p>They sat down under the shade of a tree in the little
inclosure and resumed their talk.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it is very hard to get used to the world
as it is? I really am afraid I never shall."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Liebenhoff, "and more than that, I
never intend to. My struggle has always been to preserve
my principles and sentiments intact without bigotry or vainglory;
to lead a true and natural life in a very artificial
state of society, and in the midst of mean and false customs,
where a low standard of life and manners is set up;
to walk with a pure and affectionate spirit among my fellows,
with my eye fixed with unfaltering gaze upon the
banner in the skies, upon which is inscribed, 'Liberty,
Holiness, Love!' But it is a weary way of traveling
through life. One has too little company on the road, and
I thirst more and more for the sense of companionship in
my highest thoughts, plans, and aspirations. I am tired
of but half uttering what swells my heart almost to bursting,
so I am going to make a bold stroke and try and bring
the world up to my stand-point. Presumptuous am I not?"</p>

<p>"The world will think so; but you are blessed in the
sympathy of Mr. Liebenhoff."</p>

<p>"O yes, and until lately I have left to him, through his
preaching, to which I have ever listened with a more entire
satisfaction than to that of any other man, to express for

<!--- vol 1 page 191 -->

me my deep sense of the need of our race for the Christian
religion, and his conversation in social life, varied as it
is by the expression of the most cheerful yet fervent piety,
learning, and wide information expressed with an accurate
judgment and delicate taste, enlivened by humor and
sweetened by love, has more than compensated for my own
shortcomings in this respect. But blest with his society
and guidance for twenty years, naturally contemplative and
retiring, it cannot be but that by snatches in my busy life,
I have seized upon scraps of the intellectual wealth which
is floating all around me. And while occupied with a
thousand familiar cares, there has been good time for it to
be assimilated into my own being, and through the broad
sympathies which a docile and appreciating reception of
Christ's teachings gives to us, all the past and present
seems gathered to a loving embrace in my soul, and the
future, through the power of our faith, is, O! so glorious
to me, Zo&euml;, that I pant for the time when the good God
shall vouchsafe to reveal it more clearly to men, for then
would they never cease to adore and be led by him."</p>

<p>"Therefore you write? O, I long to read your book!
I know it will be what I most need to read."</p>

<p>"Well, I still trust that not only you, but many another
will read it, notwithstanding the dampers thrown over my
hopes from time to time by prudent friends. Ay, that to my
sex of every class and condition, I may be able to express
something of their wants, and satisfy as far as an individual
may, their vague, yearning aspirations. For to the woman
soul, with its ideality, its delicate perception of truth and
beauty, its fervor of temperament, its religious reverence
and trust, its glance of genius and its artistic insight, there
is needed another and a tenderer expression of interest, a
closer sympathy with her peculiar trials, and wiser suggestions
than men can give. They need all this from one
who has, either through sympathy, imagination or reality
'trod the wine-press' of her life's trials alone, and through

<!--- vol 1 page 192 -->

God has worked her way to the light, peace, and trust, of
believing in, loving, and adoring Him, in closer and more
constant and familiar communion than seems common in
this cold, intellectual age. One friend tells me, on reading
what I have already written, that it will be suited only to
the more refined and cultured classes, that the majority
will throw it aside for the flashy tale of passion and
intrigue. But I do not believe it, for I have an instinctive
dread of cliques, which is strengthened every year by
every principle and high conviction. I was born among
<i>the people</i>, I have ever lived and been familiar with and
loved them. I know them, I trust them. I see between
the poorest, coarsest, and most uneducated, and the most
favored only the differences which circumstances create,
and often I long to fly from the gilded surroundings of the
one to the lowly hovel of the other, for the comfort, suggestion,
and hope which I find not in satin and gold, or in
her who puts her trust in their superficial splendor. So
that in my heart of hearts, I have an earnest that even the
most ignorant, degraded, and wretched will be brought into
sympathy with me through my pen, and will find in its flow
some solace, support, and strength to relieve them from
their woe. And if it can, like Ithuriel's spear, touch the
great heart of struggling, suffering, aspiring humanity,
crushed and bleeding as it lies under the hoof of the
spoiler, and it shall start up, it may be, in its ugly nakedness
at its thrill, O! then will I plead that, like maniac of
old, through the spirit of Christ which it is my life's aim
to paint, it may become clothed in the garments of virtue
and holiness, and conscious of its restoration to its right
mind evermore sit at his feet. And if the lowly and fainting
ones find in my tale some nutriment, enjoyment, and
inspiration, then am I sure of an audience with the stronger
and happier, for life is ever in an ascending series. The
germ of its best products lies deep in the common mould.
Gradually the little seed swells, and enlarges, and bursts

<!--- vol 1 page 193 -->

its envelope. It spreads its roots and sinks its foundation
down towards the world's centre. It shoots upwards and
expands its leaflets to the sunlight. Every element of
nature and the direct smile of the Almighty watch over it
and contribute to its growth. Slowly but surely, it is elaborated,
expanded, and beautified, until trunk, branch, leaf,
bud, and flower attest to his wonder-working hand in creation,
and his goodness in spreading it so fairly for 'the
healing of <i>the nations</i>.' In like manner, as God rears high
its structure and transfuses its sap into the rude bark-covering
as into every delicate vein of its flower-petal, so
will I utter the best that is in me, either of mirth, of sadness,
or high contemplation, and send it lovingly forth to
the great multitudes all over the world, nor be impatient
and distrustful if it makes its way slowly among them; for
this I know, that even 'a cup of cold water' tendered in
the spirit of our faith, refreshes and purifies, and thus
yields its reward; then how much more the very spirit of
one's best life's experience, hopes, and aspirations poured
out of a burning soul?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Liebenhoff encourages you, I know."</p>

<p>"O yes, I never fail of sympathy from him; yet very
wisely, as he thinks, he puts a check upon what he regards
as excited hopes, for fear perhaps that I should grow elated
and proud; and another friend thinks I need the discouragement
of some 'hardhearted man of business' to moderate
my expectations, so he very properly gives me his
plain opinion. But how little do we know of each other
here. Afraid of my being proud! Why, I have eaten
little else than <i>humble pie</i> all my life, so that I am one
great slice of humility! But in this condition of lowliness,
Zo&euml;, I have learned to see clearly that God is to be
glorified and man exalted by ministering as we may, to the
best good of mankind, and when we have been led by one
path or another to the altar of self-consecration, and
experienced the blessed fruition which flows from it; you

<!--- vol 1 page 194 -->

may as soon look to see Orion smiling with vanity expressed
in his twinkling orbs, or the moon covering her
face through a weak self-consciousness, or the sun striding
through the heavens with a step of haughty pride, as vainglory
in such a one. For when we are led into full communion
with Him, then reposes the soul upon the will of
the Most High, without care for its destiny, whether it be to
be blighted like an untimely flower, to bask like the ephemeron
in the sun for a day, or like the sturdy oak to stand
firm against the varied fortunes of centuries. For to know
that we are in his hands is sufficient. I have but little
anxiety for my story, but I <i>know</i> it will go."</p>

<p>"I trust it will not be like many books that I attempt to
read. It seems to me that their authors have a great many
crude ideas, which they think much of and very recklessly
express. Another person dislikes them, and gets angry,
and sends forth another book in a very unchristian spirit to
oppose the first, when ten to one, his own ideas are not
any truer; and so it goes," said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"Yes, criticism, criticism is the spirit of the age. We
have got beyond our soundings upon some most important
points, and need to plant our feet firmly by the side of
Jesus upon the shore of the great ocean of truth, and take
our reckoning anew, and then we shall live in and give out
the positive, and not forever deal in negations."</p>

<p>"It puzzles me to hear the philosophers and theologians
talk about what they call the essential doctrines of religion.
I don't find them in the precepts of Jesus, and they seem
to me very contrary to nature," said Zo&euml; again.</p>

<p>"So they do to me, and most injurious also, as turning
men's attention aside from the pure, and holy, and benevolent
life of the author of our faith, and subverting his
faultless rules which are to be our guide. And to one
who, when young, acknowledged the authority of these, and
has ever found that they enabled one, as Jesus said they
would, to be like the house founded 'upon the rock,' upon

<!--- vol 1 page 195 -->

which the storms of time might beat in vain, the discussion
upon these knotty points seems like the talk of the demons
in Pandemonium, of whom the English poet writes, when
they reasoned</p>

<p class="small">"Of providence, foreknowledge, will, and fate,<br/>

Fixed fate, free-will, foreknowledge absolute.<br/>

And found no end, in wandering mazes lost;<br/>

Of good and evil much they argued then,<br/>

Of happiness and final misery,<br/>

Passion and apathy, and glory and shame,<br/>

Vain wisdom all, and false philosophy."</p>

<p>"One evening last week, there was a long conversation
between our German friend, Professor Henschall, and Mr.
Lias. Mr. Liebenhoff, who has but little interest in the
subject, chimed in, however, with his modifications, and Mr.
Pendleton described to us the extreme ground which the
prevailing sects in his country took upon these vexed
questions. I sat and listened to the account of these abortions
of the mind until the air about me seemed to become
blue and imbued with a sulphurous smell. Flames of fire
enveloped the forms of our friends, their tongues were
like fiery serpents, and their eyes gleamed like coals from
the furnace of the bottomless pit, in which their thoughts
seemed determined to dwell. I fancied my garments were
becoming scorched, and I trembled lest they would draw
me into this terrible vortex. I rushed out and never was
the sweet air of heaven or the bright stars on high so welcome
to me. 'O beautiful universe!' said I, 'ye elder
scriptures of God! roll on in your majesty and loveliness,
and may our ears be opened to listen to your daily and
nightly revelation, for the written Word has become darkened
and deadened to the eyes of mankind. They read
in it the gloomy and horrible doctrines of their own perverted
minds. They see in thee, O Father, but the stern
tyrant, the inflexible, cruel, and unjust judge of their own
hardened natures, and thy all-abounding care to thy children
in sending them prophets, apostles, and above all, thy

<!--- vol 1 page 196 -->

well-beloved Son to teach us of Thee, and thy infinite love,
and how we can become like Thee, they convert it into a
terrible scheme which steals thy abounding salvation from
all but a few. O horrible doctrines! O unfortunate world!
O wretched, bewildered, and orphaned mankind, wandering
through space, (if we believe their words to be true,)
demons by birth, nurtured in corruption and sin, and destined
to eternal damnation! O my soul, come not into their
counsels again!"</p>

<p>"But these are considered the great men of the age,
are they not?"</p>

<p>"O yes, strong thinkers they are called; too strong altogether
in their love of one particular figure of the New
Testament, in which fire and brimstone are prominent. To
us Orientals, Zo&euml;, it seems very stupid in these mighty
Anglo-Saxons to make their creeds out of our favorite
tropes and metaphors, which are so abundantly scattered
through the Bible. That comes of making metaphysics all
in all in the exaggerated culture of the <i>understanding</i>,
which is the order of the day. They will have to come
round to our ground and acknowledge that the soul is
something more than a sharp iron spike, christened <i>intellect</i>,
to pry into things with. They have made a pretty
mess of creation with their narrow way of dealing with it,
and with human nature, that emanation from the Divinity.
Anything is invaluable to them that shines, if it is nothing
but a piece of old carbon, brightened up by staying under
ground a few centuries. No matter what a theory is, if it
is only brilliant and ingenious. Is it to be wondered at
that the deep, crystal well of truth undefiled, hides itself
from their shallow inquiries? And yet the most subtle
results of the mind are like a dead mass of matter without
it."</p>

<p>"But there are a great many seekers after, and teachers
of truth in these days, I should think," said Zo&euml;. "Our
new master speaks of the benefit he has derived from the

<!--- vol 1 page 197 -->

study of the German philosophers and theologians of the
present day."</p>

<p>"O yes, if people will get into the 'wild woods' of dark
speculation and skepticism through their dullness, disobedience,
pride and self-conceit in this late day of our Lord's
kingdom, it is well that there are moral Hercules to venture
in and drag them out by the head and shoulders, all
bruised and battered, and slay the hydra-headed monster
in whose grasp they are struggling. Yet in a family, that
is not considered the best child who, like a fool, is always
running into mischief through rebellion; nor he the most
agreeable member of it, who does nothing but drag him
out of it and sour his temper, may-be, by continued castigation;
on the contrary, that one is best, who buds and flowers
gracefully, as God intended it should, through the pure
counsels and example of loving and enlightened parents,
who, through his docile obedience, are at liberty to leave
behind the beggarly elements of our religion and go on to
higher and still higher attainments in it. So in society, it
seems to me that our Father loves and approves more of
those of his children who receive, with a meek and docile
temper, his instructions to them through his Christ, his
greatest, truest, and purest messenger, comprised principally
in his sermon on the Mount and his parables, believing
implicitly in the good which he says will result from them,
than those who stick in the crude thoughts of the heathen,
who lived before his time, or who overlay the mind with
the corruptions which crept into his church after it. For
the Beatitudes are the nutriment which Jesus elaborated
from all that was choicest and loveliest of the fruits and
flowers in the moral and spiritual universe of which we are
a part, and them he places before the ages, and by his life
of benevolence and love, pleads with us to grow up into
their sublime, and tender, and holy disposition, and live
everlastingly. And where in them do we find the so-called
'essential doctrines of Christianity?' The <i>spirit</i> with

<!--- vol 1 page 198 -->

which he walked among men, from childhood to manhood,
which shone out in his obedience to his parents; in his
zeal in the search after knowledge and light; his true sense
of the use, which he was to make of his mighty powers;
his humility, his affection, his patriotism, which embraced
the widest philanthropy; and his philanthropy which inclosed
as its nucleus the most heart-melting patriotism,
when he foresaw his country's doom; his submission to his
inevitable fate, and his martyr-death, crowned, as it was,
with the clustered virtues of filial love, confiding friendship,
forgiveness of enemies, disinterested regard for the
penitent, resignation and trust&mdash;this <i>spirit</i>, I say, is the
more than nectar, of which that of the gods was but a feeble
type, which, by drinking of it fully and freely, will
make us sublime and godlike as himself. And where in
<i>it</i> do we find the assumption, the bigotry, the narrow policy,
the corrupt yielding to the sins of the times, the miserable
fear and distrust of God, the low ambition, hypocrisy,
deception, cruelty, and fraud of multitudes, in the so-called
churches of Christendom? The eye of the world is
not couched to see all this; but I have a living proof of the
truth of my sermon, which I fear has wearied you, in my
beloved husband; and here is a letter from that same.
Thank you, Carl," said she, as she received it from the
hands of the lad who brought it. "I have not told you,
Zo&euml;, that he is absent for a few days. Run around the
garden, or anywhere you please about the premises, while
I read it."</p>

<p>HILDA practiced her music, a difficult piece from
Wagner, and then set off in her usual bright mood to meet
Zo&euml; at Mrs. Liebenhoff's.</p>

<p>"I shall have a merry time I know. I am so surprised
to find the little parsoness so full of fun. We laughed
and chatted together on our way home from the pic-nic in
the public conveyance, and I mean to have a second edition
of the frolic."</p>

<p>Full of this intention, she was running towards the house
when she caught a glimpse of Mrs. Liebenhoff in the
garden. She ran towards her and found her with her husband's
open letter in her hand.</p>

<p>"Ah, I have caught you in the very act, have I not? Is
it so very charming to have a lover, which one has to meet
by stealth and send messages to by craft, and in short to
pine after in secret&mdash;the fascinating Cicisbeo?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean? what has come over you?" said
Mrs. Liebenhoff, looking at her in amazement, really fearing
she had lost her wits; but she saw only the water-sprite
with her laughing, innocent, happy face, who seemed

<!--- vol 1 page 200 -->

marvelously unconscious that she was saying anything
offensive. She looked at her as if she would penetrate
into her very soul, until Hilda was sober, surprised, and
seemed as if she were ready to cry.</p>

<p>"Ah, I see," said her friend, "you have been reading
some naughty book or other, which has sent your wits and
sense of right astray. What is it, dear?"</p>

<p>"Only 'Indiana,' by George Sand."</p>

<p>" 'Indiana!' " said Mrs. Liebenhoff. "Where did you
get it? Does Miss Ingemann know what dangerous fiction
has superseded her matter-of-fact class books?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am. Rinda brought it this morning from her
home. She says it is one of her elder sister's favorite
books, and she lent it to me for an hour or two in which I
could very well run through it. Where is the mighty harm,
pray?"</p>

<p>"In its leading you to trifle, as you have just done, with
the most sacred feelings of womanhood, if in no other way,
my dear Hilda. Read this sentence, and then talk to me
of a Cicisbeo if you can. (She holds the letter so that she
may see it.) 'Together have we borne the trials and
quaffed the joys of our youth, each day made happier, and
I trust holier by each other; and now that from the height
of full middle-life we cast our horoscope anew, whatever
may betide, whether sickness or health, prosperity or adversity,
we know that we can, by the beautiful experience
of the past, ever repose more and more upon each other's
truth and affection, which shall be God-ministers to point
to the virtues and joys of the heavens above.' "</p>

<p>"But 'Indiana' had an old, cross husband who made
her very wretched, and so she accepted a lover. Very
wrong I know, but was she not to be pitied and excused,
partially? Of course, ma'am, I was only in fun in speaking
thus to you."</p>

<p>"O yes, I know, and I agree that Indiana, and such as
she, are to be pitied, who, for a loving protector and guide,

<!--- vol 1 page 201 -->

find in their marriage only a jailer, harsh, coarse, and
repulsive. But our fortunes are not altogether in our own
hands in this world. Indiana was under God's care and
discipline no less than her husband's rule, and only he
should have severed the bond between them."</p>

<p>"Then you would bear everything from a cruel, heartless
tyrant until God saw fit to take him out of the world?"</p>

<p>"I do not say that. There is a cause which annuls all
obligation, because first broken down by the guilty husband;
and it is vain to seek to keep united a one-sided bond. It
is a contradiction in terms; but whatever betide, the wife
is to keep herself true. What do I say! It is only for
lawyers and courts to speak thus coldly and juridically of
this delicate connection, or of aught that can sever it. To
the pure and religious wife it has been formed by 'our
Father.' It was He who saw how his child needed to be
tempered, and trained, and through what trials or joys she
was to weave her wings for the skies. If he judged her
strong and good enough to place in her keeping one of his
most faulty ones; it was that through holy marriage he too
might become meet for his presence. You can decide,
Hilda, whether she fulfills her trust when she abandons
him for a lover. And what was <i>he</i>, pray, this <i>fascinating
Cicisbeo?</i>"

<p>"Why, a vulgar, vicious, disgusting fellow to-be-sure!
Yes, yes, I see it was all dreadful, and I am ashamed
of myself and of speaking thus to you. Will you forgive
me?"</p>

<p>"When through marriage," said she, kissing her, "my
Undine has a tender and more thoughtful soul breathed
into her gladsome life, she will know better than to ever
whisper to herself or her friends of <i>Cicisbeos</i>. But have
done with preaching! I have already sermonized Zo&euml; and
sent her away for relief. Run and find her, dear."</p>

<p>They now returned and seated themselves side by side
on the turf.

<!--- vol 1 page 202 -->

<p>"How do you like my new hat, ma'am?" said Hilda,
untying it and laying it aside.</p>

<p>"Very much," said she. "I noticed it the first moment
you came, and thought it very becoming."</p>

<p>"Then if you <i>are</i> a pious minister's wife, you like pretty
things, I see."</p>

<p>"Why not, pray? My eyes are set in my head very
much like other people's, and I profess to have as good a
taste as my neighbors. I always dress just as pretty as I
have the means to, and always intend to."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Zo&euml;. "I wish I could be clad as
prettily as the violets and lilies are. God adorns them
beautifully, and I do not want to be a blot upon fair
creation in my person more than in my mind and character.
I have become quite converted in this respect
lately."</p>

<p>"That is right," said Mrs. Liebenhoff, "only do not let
dress encroach upon higher duties and tastes; and the
more the latter take the first rank in our regard, to the
well-balanced mind does external ornament seem appropriate
and harmonious."</p>

<p>"I am delighted!" said Hilda.</p>

<p>"I am going to dress well even when I am very old,"
said Mrs. Liebenhoff. "I shall not wear four caps and
five shawls about my person, like a certain old lady I heard
of the other day. It is more than my share, I should take
up too great a proportion of room, besides looking like a
formless heap of linsey-woolsey and cotton lace; and if I
am a minister's wife, I am not one to 'wear a green ribbon
and look very thankful,' not I."</p>

<p>"How old <i>are</i> you, Mrs. Liebenhoff?" said Hilda, with
all simplicity.</p>

<p>"What a daring question to ask a lady of my age!" said
she. "That is one of the legitimate secrets of a woman
past twenty-eight. The idea of my revealing it, indeed!
What crooked fairy possesses the little girl this blessed

afternoon? But rather than disappoint your curiosity
entirely, I will deign to inform you that I have arrived at
the 'everlasting now,' which Carlyle tells us of. I am
ashamed to have been so long in coming to this desired
haven, but here I intend to fast moor my lifeboat and never
be drifted away from it. My sister, Katrina, who is a disciple
of Spiritualism, says that there is no time in the
heavenly sphere, and I see no reason why there should be
here, especially to ladies of my mature years. My soul is
a great deal younger than when it was born into this murky
time-world, because now I really begin to see daylight
ahead, which is quite rejuvenating in its effect, I can
assure you; so I am just of no age at all."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Hilda, "only alas for the birthday gifts if
that era never comes round!"</p>

<p>"O, I get presents, I can assure you, notwithstanding
that I live in eternity. Do you see this beautiful opal ring,
my husband's last present, given me not to tell of his inconstancy,
but that with the changes of life our love will
only shine with a more varied lustre? I like jewels, they
are so suggestive. My whole pearl, for instance, which
the little fish forms to cover up some harassing, injurious,
foreign substance, inserted by accident into its shell. What
a lesson to me to envelope my troubles with the covering
of a beautiful resignation, which will enable me to float
through life, injuring no one by my harsh contact, but to
give out the gentle radiance of this precious tribute of the
sea! My garnets; of slight value in money because plentifully
abounding among the common rocks of the hills:
all the richer for me, showing that there are bright virtues
shining out abundantly from among the rudest of humanity.
My more brilliant ones, set with little pearls, mean fervor
and purity combined. I know some one by whose face I
might place my sparkling bracelet and say: 'What an excellent
likeness!' And so I might go on to the end of the
catalogue."</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 204 -->

<p>"But you say nothing about diamonds," said Hilda; "I
really feel that my pet ring is neglected."</p>

<p>"O intensely brilliant and sparkling and transparent,
like the great lights of the present age, but with too little
depth for me! Give me the pearl which has more soul
than it displays to the shallow penetration of the day!
'Sour grapes,' you will say, as I do not happen to have
one. I used to try to get up great admiration for the diamond,
thinking that it had been elaborating since time was,
in the lowest strata of the earth's formation, but when I read
that it is found in the sandstone, and of course is the result
of less time and cost, I lost my interest in it somewhat.
Very splendid it is of course, but I can live without it&mdash;and
if I were as rich as Cr&oelig;sus I would not give the
foolish thousands for it that some do."</p>

<p>"I met a lady in the street as I came here, who I am
sure rouges; her cheeks were so delicately rosy, and I
have seen her when she looked very sallow," said Hilda.</p>

<p>"Perhaps she was flushed with heat," said Mrs. Liebenhoff.
"I never saw more than one or two in my life whom
I suspected of having an artificial color. Did she look as
if she were masked?"</p>

<p>"No; I think it made her prettier than without it," said
she. "She used <i>rather</i> too much powder. To be artistically
put on, it ought not to lie in lines but be suffused, so
as to have the face look somewhat like a ripe peach with
the down on."</p>

<p>The two other ladies laughed.</p>

<p>"Let me study yours," said the elder, "so that I may
adopt your style, as I suppose you have got the right
medium, being an artistic judge. Well, I shall take you
for my model rather than Miss Lias, who puts so much on
her cheeks as to make them stand out in quite bold relief,
while her eyes, surrounded as they are, with a dark circle,
are cast into so deep a shadow, that they look as if some
one had dealt them a heavy blow, forcing them quite backwards.

<!--- vol 1 page 205 -->

I wonder if they are receding to look after the
lady's brains. At any rate her process of beautifying herself
has a <i>stunning</i> effect upon me, I can assure you. O,
Hilda! my fresh, fair and frank-hearted! give to the winds
all thoughts of the paint, plaster, pomatum, and powder,
for which young ladies in these days exchange their delicate
natural beauties, only to disfigure and destroy them
with these counterfeits. You are pretty enough without
them. I take the responsibility of flattering you thus
much."</p>

<p>Hilda rushed impulsively to the little fountain near, and
dipping her hand in the water, soon washed all traces of
the powder from her face.</p>

<p>"Good-by to the first gay deceiver which has had the
art to take me in; and I mean it shall be the last," said
she.</p>

<p>"I have not told you the news," seating herself, and
beginning with fresh zest upon another subject. "Mrs.
Gylich's wedding was yesterday. Only think! her husband
has been dead but eight months. To be sure she married
an intimate friend whom Mr. Gylich loved and confided
in. She was truly inconsolable when he died, for they were
warmly attached, and she was perfectly devoted to him;
but she is very affectionate, and is one of those who always
require some one to lean upon, and that is the reason she
married so soon, I suppose."</p>

<p>"And could she not wait even one little year," said Mrs.
Liebenhoff, "and devote it to honor and cherish his memory,
and thus blend anew their separated, yet more than
ever united lives; for when the death-vail divides them
from earthly vision, who knows but a purer and closer union
grows up between them, even while they walk to the common
eye so differently ensphered? And shall another
presumptuously step between these two souls, who were
everything to each other here, ere they adjust themselves
as God would have them, to an experience of a higher and

<!--- vol 1 page 206 -->

more celestial sympathy, growing out of the earthly and
lasting for aye? Nothing would make me doubt so much
whether this friend were fitted to succeed him in her affections,
as his appreciating no better the holiest and tenderest
feelings of a woman's nature than to thrust himself thus
early between them."</p>

<p>"Zo&euml;," continued Hilda, "says she cannot bear to think
of second marriages at all, especially for a woman. She
seems to consider it an unpardonable sin in her to contract
one. Now there may be cases when it would be very
natural and proper in my opinion. For instance, Indiana,
who married an old, disagreeable husband, not because she
loved him, but because her parents made the marriage for
her, I think if he had died, and she and her lover wished
to marry very much, they might do so, rather than for her
to remain a forlorn widow all her days. Or, I will say, even
if her husband were kind and she had loved him ever so
much, if he chose to leave her and go to heaven, where,
as everybody says he would be a thousand times happier
than she can be here, marry again or not, I don't think he
would be so selfish as to wish her to remain weeping till
old age over his grave, while he, perhaps, was careering
through the universe, seeing all the beautiful sights and
hearing the delightful music with, perhaps, some fair young
lady-angel, who knows? Now confess the truth, Mrs.
Liebenhoff, could you not possibly be induced to marry the
dear friend, and give the excuse, if you chose, that you
were <i>so lonesome</i>, as they all do? Say, please."</p>

<p>"My dear," said Mrs. Liebenhoff, "we will drop the
subject where it is. It is one upon which I am accustomed
to shun all personal reference. I am satisfied with my
present destiny, and I have no wish to make any future
reckoning upon this point."</p>

<p>Hilda looked crest-fallen and Zo&euml; disappointed, but after
a pause the latter insisted with more confidence than was
usual to her: "You said the other day, dear Mrs. Liebenhoff,

<!--- vol 1 page 207 -->

that you were accustomed to live through many
scenes to which we are liable in life, by imagination and
sympathy, and that thus you had often prepared yourself
for great emergencies. Why not this for our benefit?"</p>

<p>"Well then," said she, with a rapid utterance, "who
am I, to say that I would surely do or not do this or that in
the future of a world in which God notes 'the sparrow's
fall' and numbers the hairs of our heads? I have long
since learned that such presumption is rebuked, by having
done exactly contrary to what, in my impetuous youth, I
avowed I would, and yet at the time, it seemed God's will.
It might be the same in such a case. But of this, I may
venture to be sure, that I never would link my life with
another, divided as it would ever be to me, unless he had
a nature broad enough, and a culture elevated enough to
share with me each high and holy feeling, awakened by the
changing experiences of life. Unless he would say in
spirit, if not in words: 'I ask you to cover up for me no
precious memory, or crush no natural wish to blend the
name, and spirit, and deeds of him on high in meet and
loving harmony with our own most consecrated acts.
Together will we stand by his grave, and as I see your
faithful remembrance of him, I gather fresh surety that
you will be true to me, and as you have done your full
duty to the deceased, so no shadow shall be cast from his
tomb, and no lament come sighing from over it to darken
our marriage-day, or blend its discord with the sweet music
of our bridal f&ecirc;te.' For when nature, religion, and love
combine to weave themselves into a flower-garland and
crown the brow of the true woman, there need be no fear
that the different spheres of her earthly life will jostle
against each other in rude and painful collision, but her
heart will be more than broad and generous enough, and
her soul too full of melting tenderness for <i>him</i> to fail of
finding in its smile the heaven he pines for."</p>

<p>She looked up as she finished and saw Theresa Ingalls

<!--- vol 1 page 208 -->

standing a few steps from her. She had heard her last
remarks.</p>

<p>"A fresh breeze from the west!" said she.</p>

<p>"Welcome! and brush away some of the cobwebs which
are sticking about these little girls' brains this afternoon.
They really are too much for me with their astonishing
surprises and unexpected questionings. I should think
<i>you</i> had been dealing with them. At any rate, I will pass
them over to the strong-minded young American, for they
quite upset my equilibrium," and her face assumed an
anxious expression unusual to it.</p>

<p>"You don't pretend to say that you find any man, living
or dead, worthy of all <i>that</i> sentiment, do you? I think less
of the German and Danish gentlemen, if possible, than I
do of ours. Indeed I think I shall be ready to fall quite
in love with them in toto when I go back; they seem to me
so much more chivalrous and truly wise and refined, and
in advance of yours in their judgment of us. To decide
by what I have seen of a woman's life in Europe, it seems
to be considered that, in general, she fulfills her mission
when she cooks, sews, keeps the house, and tends the
children; or if there is especial magnanimity and great
desire to award her her full rights, she is to have a privilege
commensurate with the whole length and breadth
of her capacity, viz.: to make herself as pretty and
agreeable as possible for his supreme and selfish pleasure,
or if he happens to get into trouble (of course she
never does) he gives her full liberty to devote her life to
his <i>comfort</i> and <i>solace</i>. What wonderful condescension!"</p>

<p>"I know it is very much so among the majority; but the
time will come when it will be seen that a woman's clear
insight and quick moral sense are to serve as a barometer
to warn society against corruption and sin; that her veneration
and trust are to be the weather-vanes to keep the
proud, speculative intellects of men in the direction of
clear and starry skies; her charity and love are to enfold

<!--- vol 1 page 209 -->

and keep warm the heart of the world, which otherwise
would be forever imbittered, estranged, enraged, crusted
over with selfishness, or blackened by tyranny and wrong&mdash;those
dragon's teeth from which horrible seeds spring up
the armed demons which ravage the earth&mdash;and her artistic
genius is to be the element which is to beautify, enrich,
and glorify life. This is to be done first through her own
ascendency of soul, and then by its natural action within
the sphere designed for it by its Maker. In accomplishing
this, her legitimate work, she will indeed include in it
every proper and needful household duty, but above and
beyond these, there will be spheres for her occupancy,
which will save her from a weak and degrading dependence
upon man, whose love, and protection, and sense of her
value to him are not up to the requirements of her nature
or the commandments of God. Thus she will become the
queen of realms never dreamed of by poets or foretold by
seers, where she will reign in the true spirit of all dominion;
even in that which giveth glory to the Almighty
through her every developed and purified faculty, that he
may be all in all. But there is the auspicious queen of
night, the evening star; the dew is falling, let us go in."</p>

<p>THE island of Iceland, of which Mrs. Liebenhoff was
a native, was discovered by Naddod, a famous Norwegian
pirate, who was driven hither by a tempest about the
year A. D. 860. Just before this period, Harold, the
Fairhaired, had extended his dominion over all the petty
kingdoms of Norway, and deprived the inhabitants of that
liberty and independence which they had previously
enjoyed. The consequence was that multitudes of their
best and bravest emigrated to the various islands in the
neighborhood, but to none so much as to the more distant
and larger one of Iceland. Here they hoped to be in
security from the rule of the oppressor; nor were their
hopes disappointed.*</p>

<p class="small">[*For these facts, see Henderson's Iceland.]</p>

<p>In little more than half a century the Icelanders formed
themselves into a regular republic on principles of the most
perfect liberty, making a wise distribution of the different
powers of government, enacting laws admirably adapted
to the peculiar circumstances of the nation, and by their
natural genius and love of liberty combined their interests

<!--- vol 1 page 211 -->

and energies in support of a political system, at once calculated
to protect the rights of individuals, and inspire the
community at large with sentiments of exalted patriotism.</p>

<p>For four hundred years they maintained for the most
part this state of freedom, and when, at the end of that
time, they became tributary to Norway, and afterwards
were connected with Denmark, they were still permitted
to retain the spirit and the government of a free people.</p>

<p>The remote ancestor of Mrs. Liebenhoff, who emigrated
to Iceland at its first settlement, was head officer of one
quarter of the island, which was divided into prefectures
or sheriffdoms. He was at the same time, as was required
that he should be, a minister of religion, and upon him
devolved the care of the temple and preservation of due
respect for the rites of worship. His descendants had,
with more or less of intermission, occupied the same station,
and her father had retained it, with great satisfaction to the
community, for a period of nearly half a century up to the
time of his death, which occurred a few years before.
Thus born and nurtured among a free and religious people,
she grew up breathing insensibly their best spirit, and
in a home where narrow means contended daily with wide
opportunities for the judicious and benevolent use of large
ones, in which the dispositions and habitudes of both her
parents harmonized much more with the dispensation of
what is commonly thought sufficient by the more affluent,
than with their own small yearly pittance, it followed that
the most rigid economy in deed, though seldom alluded to
by word, was the order of the household. To meet the
various exigencies of such a life and preserve an honorable
independence from pecuniary embarrassments, the children,
a goodly number, were inured to hardy toil and a
careless freedom from reliance on any of the luxuries,
which by many in the same station of life were considered
indispensable.</p>

<p>Living in a rural district, she shared the employments,

<!--- vol 1 page 212 -->

the sports, and the means of culture of the country people,
and in a severe climate where the greater part of the year
the inhabitants are confined within doors, she grew up
studious and contemplative. It is well known that the
advancement of the Icelanders in science and literature
has been of no inferior character. At a period when the
darkest gloom was spread over the horizon of Europe, they
were cultivating the arts of poetry and history, and laying
up stores of knowledge which were not merely to supply
posterity with data respecting the domestic and political
affairs of their native country, but were also destined to
furnish very ample and satisfactory information on a great
multiplicity of important points connected with the history
of other nations. To this a wonderful combination of circumstances
proved favorable. The Norwegians, who first
went over to Iceland, were sprung from some of the most
distinguished families in the land of their nativity. They
had been accustomed to listen to the traditionary tales of
the deeds of other years and had frequented the public
assemblies where they saw the value and importance of
knowledge. Their mythology and the wonderful scenery
of their native land were favorable to the cultivation of
poetic genius. The art of writing was for a long time
little practiced, and in order to transmit to posterity an
accurate knowledge of important events, history assumed
the garb of a poetry peculiar, underived, and national in its
character.</p>

<p>The fame of the Skalds or poets of Iceland was not
confined to their native country. They visited the courts
of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, where they were received
with the highest honors; and the Edda, which comprises
their most important poetry, and the Sagas their historical
compositions, chiefly reliable for their truth, though
occasionally wreathed with beautiful fictions, were dealt out
to the admiring ears of their entertainers and reaped from
them a rich reward.</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 213 -->

<p>Thus, though the native of a bleak, barren, and frigid
island, scarcely noticeable as the eye runs over the map of
the more extensive and prouder countries of Europe, Mrs.
Liebenhoff, it may be seen, grew up encircled by no mean
environments. Naturally of a poetic and imaginative cast
of mind, she found no lack of excitement for these prevailing
traits in her quiet and secluded home in the literature
of her own country, no less than that of other lands
which flowed in from time to time at the call of eager
seekers after knowledge among the more cultured of her
people.</p>

<p>The natural wonders of the island, too, had a powerful
effect upon her training. Here were burning mountains
and eternal glaciers, rivers of lava, boiling springs and
floating fields of ice, bringing from regions far to the north
their intenser cold, and their wild, strange animals, where
the sun is too feeble in its rays to dye their furs. Here was
displayed also on a grand scale, the Aurora Borealis, those
mystic heavenly lights, now flashing out in the horizon,
with a more weird-like lustre than the lightning, to disappear
and be seen anew, blazing far up in the zenith, extinguishing
the north star's steady light, and putting to the
blush the fervid planet Mars by their blazing stare into his
face, and their eccentric whirligig around him. And when
the dogs would howl and moan at the ghost-like music
which accompanied their wondrous dance, she too would
bend low with her protecting arm about their necks, and
feel a suffocating sense of awe and dread, which made
her cling to them in strange companionship. For, to the
gentle, loving woman-poet, the sublime and the awful are
soon wearisome and overpowering, and she longs for the
warm sunlight and tender shade, and sweet dews of evening,
which may bring to her senses the distillation of flower,
fruit, and tree, and hush her spiritual nature to the repose
of silent communion, in which she can hear the "still
small voice" of God in the holy of holies, which he has

<!--- vol 1 page 214 -->

fashioned within all outer courts, even in the sanctuary of
her own soul. But where in her cold clime, in which summer
is but welcomed ere it is flown, where nature seems
in chaos, whole regions lying blasted as it were, by the
scorching fires of some evil demon, and where centuries
must roll on before they put on the garments of loveliness
which reflect the benignity and mercy of a God of these
attributes, could she find the home of her yearnings? The
occasional terrible devastations by volcanoes and shipwrecks,
and the various hardships of life in a rude and
sterile country kept her sensibilities painfully upon the
stretch. Lacking the energetic, demonstrative qualities of
the other members of her family, who were ever efficiently
employed in deeds of useful benevolence, in which, it is
true, she shared, though only in the quiet way suited to
her disposition, she all the more sought for refuge amidst
gentle scenes, and for a scope for the longings to do good
consonant, at the same time, with a generous nature and
very retiring habits.</p>

<p>To the Bible she resorted for the glowing home she desired,
and the perfect ideal of her youthful aspirations.
There she found, not only her way of duty and the path of
peace, which comes from the sense of forgiveness, and the
hope of eternal life through the knowledge of God and immortality
brought by Jesus; but besides all these, the most
subtle and satisfying food for her poetic being, the richest
storehouse for her gorgeous fancies, and the fullest treasury
of feeling with which to feed her craving, impassioned
nature. So that it came to pass, that in the usual catechetical
exercise of the Sabbath morning, when, dressed
in their simple <i>best</i>, the children would gather around their
pastor to answer his questions from the Scriptures, with
her brief reply to "who was the first man, and where was
he placed," there welled up images of living, paridisaical
scenes, and of lovely innocence expressed in the perfect
form of the first man and woman, which painted themselves

<!--- vol 1 page 215 -->

all the more enduringly upon her ardent artist-soul that
they never were expressed. With Noah, she entered the
ark and swept with the floods over the wreck of a drowning
world. With Abraham, she sojourned; rejoiced with
Sarah, and wept with Hagar over her sense of injury and
desolation. With Moses, she led the Israelites through
the wilderness towards the promised land, and shared with
them their varied fortunes through the ages, as conquerors,
as rebels from Jehovah, and captives in a foreign land, as
freed from bondage, and as, with mingled feelings, they
builded the walls of their temple anew.</p>

<p>And with their history came breathing over her, even
during the most chill and dreary Icelandic winter's night,
the waving of palm-trees and of the cedars of Lebanon,
the gurgling of the fountain, more precious than the gold
of Ophir to the weary, dusty pilgrim of the desert, and the
savor of manna to her hungry nature. And with each incident
of historic life, and every scene of nature from the
hallowed East, came blended as of yore the "Thus saith
the Lord," to the acts of her present life and her dreams
of the future. As she flowered into her full youth out of
a many-sided, interior experience, needless to dwell upon,
and Jesus, the faint ideal of her childhood, became the fixed
pole-star of her maturity, little by little came out in full
relief the perfection of his character, in which no quality
stood out too prominently, leaving others only indicated,
but in which all were in just proportion, making the
whole full, round, and harmonious. As one great man
after another rose and set in history or in society around
her, wielding power for a brief period by some one over-grown
development, she clung the more closely to the
Leader of the ages, understanding through others' deformities
no less than his own transcendent superiority, the
reason of their imperfect appreciation of him, and why, by
some he was deified, and by others denied. Then came
the resolve, which grew stronger and stronger with years,

<!--- vol 1 page 216 -->

first to live out her own conception of him as revealed to
herself, and afterwards through her imagination and culture,
to represent it, weaving into her fiction thoughts upon
the position, and wants, and destiny of her sex in the civilization
of the day; for in the uprising of the feminine
element did she foresee the restoration of the world.</p>

<p>Married as she was most happily after the period of her
early, stormy youth to a man of an intellect, character, and
heart rare in their truthfulness, enlargement, and tenderness,
she found in him the guide and example to aid her in
her secret life-wish, and deemed herself blessed in a companionship
with him through a broad range of her being,
though into its intenser life his calm, and clear, and equable
soul was never spontaneously led, and of which, therefore,
on account of her reserve on points where she was
not instinctively met, he had but little cognizance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Liebenhoff and Mrs. K&ouml;rner were now in the happy
reception of a visit from their relatives from Iceland, two
sisters and a brother-in-law, with their children. After
some playful dispute between the sisters, the parties were
finally arranged to the satisfaction of both, and a pretty equal
division made of the guests between the two mansions.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hansen, one of the guest-sisters, the next older to
Mrs. Liebenhoff, between whom there had ever been a
strong affection and sympathy, though in some respects
very different, had lately become deeply interested in the
subject of Spiritualism. This wide-spread delusion, if such
it can be called, had taken its rise in America, but as spontaneous
movements among masses of people are almost
always simultaneous in different regions, showing the
magical sympathy ever existing between the great family
of humanity, so in Europe it was beginning to attract much
attention. Mrs. Hansen, a woman of a strong, healthy
mind and physique, with no predominance of imagination,
but with an exact, practical intellect and of a high-toned,
deeply religious character, had been led, by curiosity in

<!--- vol 1 page 217 -->

the first place, to investigate the subject. After a few experiments,
too well known to be repeated, to bring herself,
as is supposed, into communication with the spiritual world,
she had been astonished at the developments made to her
inner life and its increased wealth and enjoyment thereby.</p>

<p>As the two sisters were sitting together the day after
their arrival, the subject was introduced.</p>

<p>"It surprised me," said Mrs. Liebenhoff, "to hear of
your being a subject of this mania, with your sound judgment
to keep you right."</p>

<p>"Do not call it a mania," replied Mrs. Hansen; "for it
seems to me the only true life, this close intercourse with
the spiritual world, which is granted me."</p>

<p>"I do not feel disposed to deny its truth yet, any more
than that of many other subjects which come up at the
present day. I simply wait for further data and a stronger
light thrown on it thereby, before I determine its reality.
But this much I must say, that we are very ignorant of the
nature of our minds, and still more in the dark upon the
subject of Inspiration, the way in which we are influenced
by the great Spirit of the universe; and as yet I have seen
or heard nothing well authenticated which convinces me
that a new mode of communication is opened between us
and heaven."</p>

<p>"How can I account then for my power of writing involuntarily
of what had never before entered my mind, and
of receiving from different spirits, from our brother's for
instance, information which I knew not from any other
source?"</p>

<p>"Have you never had any false or mistaken information
given?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the spirits are candid, and say that of earthly
things they have not sure knowledge; so they sometimes
mislead, and in one instance I was induced myself to take
steps for the recovery of property which I found not in the
possession of the person with whom I was told it was."</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 218 -->

<p>"Have you always communications from the good who
have departed?"</p>

<p>"No; one evening I was conversing with your friend,
Helenor, and I was telling her of my high estimate of her
character while on earth, and the good I had derived from
it, when my arm was sensibly twitched. I turned, and was
addressed by a low spirit who rebuked me for flattering
thus, saying, it would make her vain. 'And who are you,
friend?" I said. He spoke the familiar name of Heinrich,
who died soon after our venerable father. He said he had
through all these years, been wandering in the lowest
sphere, and knew not how to rise.  'Can you not say, God
be merciful to me a sinner!' 'That is it, that is it,' said
he exultingly&mdash;and so much power have these words had
upon his state that he has already risen to the third
sphere."</p>

<p>"I do not think you gain much by enlarging your society,
if he is a specimen of your spirit-acquaintances.
We all know the blessed effect of penitence without such
a revelation."</p>

<p>"That is an exception to the general rule. But it is
impressed upon me, that I must write."</p>

<p>She takes pen and paper, and in an unexcited manner,
writes a page and reads it to Mrs. Liebenhoff. At the conclusion,
she said, "Now these thoughts are new to me. I
never even dreamed of them before. They are not mine,
but your friend Nora's."</p>

<p>"And yet, they are in perfect harmony with Katrina
Hansen's mind, character, attainments and usual mode of
expression. It would require a warping of my judgment
to believe these thoughts the product of any one but yourself,
guided in the usual mode by the good spirit which is
ever about us, helping our infirmities. One may easily be
deceived upon this point, until we have much self-knowledge.
Our thoughts come to us we know not how, or
from whence. To the truth-loving, who has faithfully used

<!--- vol 1 page 219 -->

all possible means of instruction, whose mind through mental
culture, charity and a devout spirit, has been put into
communication with nature, humanity and God, all these
great ministers stand ready to do her bidding; and when
hushed to quiet, earnest labor, they come freighted with
their best to wait upon their priestess, to her the fire
which burns within her may seem that of a vestal, or an
angel spirit, while it is the natural but none the less wonderful
result of means which the world in its spiritual
deadness designates as common."</p>

<p>"I am disappointed. I looked for sympathy from you,
Lisbet."</p>

<p>"And you have it, my beloved sister. Heaven forbid
that it should be wanting in any experience of your life,
when yours has ever been so full, so generous, and more
than appreciating for me. But by keeping my judgment
cool and uttering my distinct convictions, we both gain
more than by any weak, yielding sympathy."</p>

<p>"O, certainly; and now what theory contrary to mine
have you to offer me, for you may be sure of its receiving
my full attention. Your remarks just now do not convince
me."</p>

<p>"I must commence with a few words upon what I consider
the connection of the Supreme Being with our spirits,
if it will not tire you."</p>

<p>"No, certainly, I wish to know the result of your own
thoughts upon this engrossing subject."</p>

<p>"I feel that the union of our souls with God, is regarded
too much as a technical and narrow thing. It is thought
that he at one time, inspires more than at another, and that
to some persons, he is partial in the bestowal of the great
gift of his spiritual influence; arbitrarily endowing them
with a clearer insight into the glorious working of his universe,
and a closer intimacy with his divine counsels. But
this seems unworthy of his greatness, and a reflection upon
his goodness. To me, God is the Sun of the moral and

<!--- vol 1 page 220 -->

spiritual universe. His beneficent light pervades all space,
and his parental love is the warmth, life, and fructifying
power by which all creatures live, move, and have their
being. In nature one object absorbs and another reflects
the rays of the natural sun, according to their essence and
quality, and nothing on the earth's surface remains unaffected
by its radiance, in a greater or less degree, according
to its capacity of reception. So with humanity, according
to each one's obedience to the laws of his being
and the requisitions of the spiritual universe, is he a recipient
of God's light in his soul. If <i>that</i> temple for its indwelling
is marred by sin, or darkened by ignorance, or
contracted by the vail drawn across its portals by bigotry,
intolerance, or narrow prejudice, and incrusted by pride,
selfishness, vainglory, and Pharisaic self-satisfaction, then
but an imperfect enlightenment reaches the spirit enshrined
within, and it gives out in consequence but feeble, flickering
beams for its own guidance or the world's advantage.
But if through our fidelity in using God's abundant means
of grace, we, who are made to reflect his image, keep the
portals of our souls wide open for the reception of his
inspiring spirit, then are we blessed with its full flow, for his
measure of its gift is stinted only by our self-inflicted incapacity
of receiving it."</p>

<p>"Then you think the inspiration of Jesus differed in
degree only, not in kind from that of other beings?"</p>

<p>"That is all. In his pure soul there was no obstruction
to the true light as it came from God, and therefore he is
the enlightener of the world. No other one has shown a
like obedience to the conditions of this inspiration; therefore
the mingled light and darkness of men's counsels."</p>

<p>"But what has this to do with communications from
spirits? These ideas of yours annul no such possibility."</p>

<p>"No, very true. As on earth we gather suggestions from
other minds of the past and present, so there seems to me
no impossibility that we may from the spirits beyond the

<!--- vol 1 page 221 -->

vail. Provided the great fact of spiritual influence is
established, and men waken up from their earthliness and
vice, the medium of that influence, if it be good, is comparatively
of small importance. This however is my own
experience. From one cause or another adhering to my
spiritual constitution, needless to comment upon, a large
part of my being has found hitherto no expression, even
with the nearest and dearest. Do not think I complain of
this; I simply speak of it as a fact. The capsule which
incloses and ripens the seeds which are to perpetuate its
life, may be long in maturing, or in finding a fitting soil in
which they may germinate; but it bides its time, and finally
it opens, and the ripened germs are scattered far and wide,
where every element stands ready to perfect its life-work.
Thus with me. But in this half isolation, weighed down
at times by imperfect fellowship, think you I would seek to
slake my longing, even at the fount of an archangel's
pity, or a seraph's sympathy? No, no. By the great privilege
taught us by our Christian faith; by the sublime power
we have of mounting to the Infinite himself, where alone
the soul may find its home, its refuge and its inspiration, I
am led to desire no lower revelations. When weary of the
world's babble, and sick at heart of its folly and blindness,
I fly to solitude and God, shall my most sacred moments
be broken in upon by some vulgar spirit's interruption?
Excuse me, Katrina; but we are accustomed to speak
plainly to each other."</p>

<p>"Yes, but if you could be useful to it!"</p>

<p>"If it heed not the greater light which we are accustomed
to think floods the higher sphere, I should distrust
the timeliness of my interference. But you always were a
missionary of good to the unhappy here, and if you have
found a new sphere of doing the same work, my sister, I
would be the last to throw cold words upon your enterprise."</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 222 -->

<p>"How do you account for the strange phenomena connected
with this subject which we hear and read of on
every side?"</p>

<p>"I cannot explain them. There are some strange manifestations
from all accounts, though I have never seen
them. But this I know, that there is great ignorance, as I
have said, prevalent upon the philosophy of the mind, its
natural workings, and its union with God. The imagination,
too, has great power over the multitudes; and besides
this, it is a subject fruitful of opportunities for fraud and
charlatanism, and there has been an abundance of these
connected with it. It is interesting to me chiefly from its
showing so conclusively that the spiritual nature will vindicate
its supremacy, though at first it may do it in strange
and awkward fashion. I trust that more light will be thrown
upon this interesting subject, and that through this upward
movement of humanity, when explained on rational and
Christian grounds, the age may take a long stride in the
march of true progress. I have a set of subjects which I
call <i>the indefinites</i>, I cannot decide upon their truth or
falsehood in my present state of knowledge and character.
So I patiently wait, leaving my mind open to what truth
may be granted to my candid inquiries. This is one of
them. I neither believe nor disbelieve the wonderful
things I hear, but making great allowance for extravagances
in this new theory, I feel that it is to lead to some truth relating
to the spiritual connection between all beings of the past
and present, and with our Father in heaven, which we
have yet not fully understood. And for the rest, I trust in
the progress of the human soul, and will not seek to tear
open untimely the bud of God's events, but wait for the
natural method of the flowering of his truth on earth. For
your calm, well-balanced mind I have no fear of fanaticism,
but hope that through it some light may be elicited, which
may be serviceable to us all."</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 223 -->

<p>"It greatly elevates and enriches my life, and I marvel
now at the contentment of others, whose thoughts are bound
chiefly to the earth; and yet I feel no lack of interest in it,
but on the contrary a purer and stronger one."</p>

<p>"I am most happy to hear it; only keep your mind open
to new convictions and nothing but good can come from it.
But the danger to the masses is that they materialize heaven
by low conceptions upon spiritual influence rather than
exalt the present. Fanaticism is always dangerous, for it
burns the soul with the unholy fire of earthly passion, while
the subject thinks himself within the very gates of heaven.
Then we do not need new mediums between us and God,
so much as to take to heart the teachings of Jesus, which
ever point to direct communion with him. The world is
prone to idolatry. At one time, it deifies one set of objects
and then another; it is so hard for the human mind
to soar to the centre of Infinity itself, and yet from thence
alone shall we bring home our choicest blessings. Pray
heaven this Spiritualism be not the Fetichism of the nineteenth
century, but may lead on to a higher development,
and to a more natural and universal union with God and
his Christ than the world has yet known."</p>

<p>"Here is your manuscript, dear Lisbet," said Mrs.
Hansen; "I have kept it concealed as you desired, only
showing it to one or two persons in all these years. On
looking over it of late, I have felt that you must have written
it under spiritual impression. Good morning for an
hour! I will call on Lina as I promised her."</p>

<p>(Mrs. Liebenhoff takes the manuscript in her hand.)
"Yes, here thou art, poor, yellow, old, young offspring of
my heart and brain! Twenty-one years ago I penned thee
with big hopes distilling from thy every syllable. To me
how much more was involved in every line than met the
cold gaze of those who passed thy pages lightly over. But
disgust and loathing followed at thy imperfect art-expression,
and so thou wast sent into obscurity. (She

<!--- vol 1 page 224 -->

runs it over.) I had forgotten almost its every incident,
and now I see it was but the embodiment of rules I laid
down for my life's observance. (She reads.) Pretty well,
Lisbet, written as it was more than a score of years ago,
and I am not so very, very old even now. Why verily, the
doctors of divinity are still groping in the muddy waters
of their dark theology, while a simple country girl worked
her mind clear of the dross of dogmas, and pierced the
very core of Christian truth, and fed upon its marrow!
And has not my soul thriven by it? Read the early and
the later Tale, and which is the more youthful in tone and
spirit, though a greater acquaintance with life, literature,
and character gives to the last the varied and dramatic life,
which the other so much lacks. What a sermon! The
story but a thread to hang grave thoughts upon, but its
principles laid down for a life-guide, not less condensed
and clear than my maturer life could furnish. I rather beg
pardon of the aforesaid doctors that I did not publish it for
their benefit; they plunge and wallow still in such dark,
muddy pools. I will lay thee tenderly aside, for thou wert
the healthful dewdrops exhaling from my soul after the
exhausting, gory sweat drawn from it by its life-battle with
the powers of evil without and the grim fancies and horrible
fears, magnifying the errors of its youth within, conjured
up by the so-called Christian, but in fact heathenish
theology, whose malaria lurks even in homes whose
inmates strive to attain and teach the perfect truth of
Jesus. O! come the time when Paganism, with its bonds
and terrors, shall be laid low in the dust forever, and Christianity,
the mild, clear, joyful genius which can alone lead
on the ages to their glorious destination, shall be seen as
it truly is, and its rightful sway be given it! Shall I dedicate
it to my young class of girls, who gather around me
on every Sabbath, and thus give it to the world? Compressed
here is the truth I have sought to teach them, and
exemplified by the few ideal characters naturally adopted

<!--- vol 1 page 225 -->

by a young maiden new to society and its checkered life.
It may be that to many a young heart working out life's
problem, it may hint of the reward awaiting the faithful
and patient laborer. But no; I shrink from this effort of
my timid, fluttering youth being thrust scornfully by or
sneered at by critics, who measure by superficial rule and
Gunter. For the work of my maturity, I care not; but thou
at least, my firstborn, pale, spring floweret, shalt have a
gentle euthanasy, and therefore I, thy mother, consign
thee without a sigh to the shadows of oblivion!"</p>

<p>During the visit of the relatives at Copenhagen, the two
sisters visited with them the different objects of interest in
the city, and among others, for the gratification of the children
particularly, the museum. There they met an unfortunate
woman, an attendant, and it may be, a part of the
show, who called forth their sympathy and interest. Mrs.
Liebenhoff, who had a nervous dread of monstrosities,
tried to evade her, but hearing her, in conversation with
her brother, utter the sentiments of a pure and resigned
spirit, she conquered her repugnance and approached her.
The woman fixed her eyes upon her and asked if she
wished to have her fortune told? Impulsively she answered
yes, then hesitated and half refused; but at length crossed
the Sybil's hand with the required piece of silver and
seated herself beside her. She took a pack of cards and
slowly passed them through her hands, reading at the same
time the number upon their surface, and as she said, the
book of Mrs. Liebenhoff's experience. She suggested to
her her prominent traits of character and mind, and also
some of the most striking events of her past life, and then
looked into the future and told her of its destiny. She did
not insist upon the truth of her prophecies; spoke of the
art as an entertainment to herself and others, and ended
by saying; "If the events of your future life prove my
words true, you will remember and think kindly of her
who foretold them." So they parted with a mutual friendly

<!--- vol 1 page 226 -->

interest, Mrs. Liebenhoff to her home and the Sybil to a
distant country, from which she said she never should
return.</p>

<p>Her friends gathered around her again, for she had not
permitted them to be present during the interview.</p>

<p>"Good luck, Lisbet?" said Mr. Hansen.</p>

<p>"O yes, plenty of money, that is good fortune, is it
not? and I shall not have to ask my husband for it either,"
said she.</p>

<p>"Children in flocks, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"O yes, of course; twins and all, more than I can
manage."</p>

<p>"What <i>did</i> she tell you, dear?" said Mr. Liebenhoff.</p>

<p>"A wonderful fact! how could she have known it; that
my husband tenderly loved me? She must be a conjurer
truly to learn that!"</p>

<p>"But, joking aside, did she really startle you by any
unexpected revelation?"</p>

<p>"Truly then, she did. Events in my life which I have
not thought of for years, she spoke of in the most matter-of-course
way. When I asked her how she performed the
art, seeing her do nothing but read her cards in a dreamy
manner and look with some attention in my face, she
touched her head and said, 'It is partly in my brain.'</p>

<p>" 'And you consider the gift as a compensation for your
misfortune, do you not?' said I to her.</p>

<p>" 'Yes,' said she, 'it brings me near my kind, and
they remember me with tenderness;' then looking again
intently in my face, she said, 'You have a lively mind, full
of fancies, and you love women.'</p>

<p>" 'Shall I write a book?' said I.</p>

<p>" 'Do you wish to?'</p>

<p>" 'O yes.' She read her cards. 'O yes,' said she, 'you
will write three.'</p>

<p>"The poor unfortunate public! thought I. 'Will they be
read?' said I, anxiously, 'for I never like to lose my labor.'</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 227 -->

<p>" 'I told you,' said she with a tone slightly impatient,
'that you had a lively fancy,' as if that were a sufficient
answer, and then began to count the money; five hundred,
nine hundred, and so on, until she seemed tired, and then
ended with, 'You will have plenty;' and then, but with no
leer, she added: 'And you love men too.' She then played
with my bracelet as a child would do, looking confidingly
into my face from time to time, when I left her to rejoin my
friends, she at the same time going out, each looking back
to find the other gazing at her until out of sight."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" said Mr. K&ouml;rner.</p>

<p>"All that I shall tell you now," said she, thoughtfully.
"It has given a new phase to my thoughts at any rate.
Was it through magnetic sympathy that she possessed herself
of floating images which, at some period of my life,
have been in my mind? If so, it is wonderful enough; or
does God impart to her, through some peculiarity of constitution,
the power to read futurity? Verily, 'there are more
things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our
philosophy.' "</p>

<p>"She was impressed, no doubt," said Mr. K&ouml;rner, with
a sly glance at Mrs. Hansen. "What is the world of
women coming to?"</p>

<p>"Two of them, to say the least, are getting quite off my
track," said his wife, with a face of solicitude.</p>

<p>"Lina, my dear, do not be anxious about Katrina, so as
to enjoy her visit to us less because she is investigating
this subject of Spiritualism. Who of us are calmer than
she? If she is mad, it is with a method most serene and
self-possessed, and I promise you that I forswear all means
to place myself in communication with ghosts, black, white,
or gray. No, no, there are enough of stupid, impracticable
people on this earth-sphere for my equability of temper,
and I find it rather doubtful whether one falls among better
ones in the other. So you need not fear me."</p>

<p>"I am told," said Mrs. Hansen, "that the air of your

<!--- vol 1 page 228 -->

city is so impure that the highest order of them cannot
breathe its impurities."</p>

<p>"Heaven defend us from the lower ones, I say! Katrina,
that convinces me that I am right in seeking spiritual communion
only with the Highest, for then I am sure that aid
and inspiration will ever be about me. His parental love
and all-surrounding presence are no less in the dense, polluted
city, than in the purer breath of the green fields or
fragrant forests, provided we keep our souls open to their
influence. To him I commend myself rather than to the
dainty spirits whose interest for us is graduated by more
or less of carbonic acid gas. That is too much like our
petty aristocracy, in their decisions of who are good
enough for their refined companionship. Save me from
such contracted sympathies, say I."</p>

<p>And she left the room, swinging her bonnet with an
absorbed expression of face quite usual with her.</p>

<p>AN extract from Mrs. Liebenhoff's
work, entitled "The Way:"</p>

<p>"Here cometh my Hebrew teacher
of the Hebrew tongue," said the
pastor's wife of Reykiavik, as she
heard his step upon the staircase
which led to her husband's study.</p>

<p>"Verily these crooked characters
and this inverse style of reading backwards instead of
forwards, agreeth not well with the spirit of my 'Tale,' which

<!--- vol 1 page 230 -->

is onward and still onward, casting no vain, regretful looks
behind, but ever pressing for the goal of the New Jerusalem,
that city in the heavens, which is to be brought down
to earth, and its temple for a universal faith to be rebuilded
by a woman. Verily, again I say, there is too much of the
dust and odor of the ages past upon the language to assort
well with my aspiring contemplations. It does not crush,
but for the time being, so confines and thwarts them that
their flutterings to be free disturb the order of my soul and
make it like the caged lion, tramping to and fro within his
narrow prison, more piteous to behold than his most dangerous
rampancy is awful. I will tell him that I must
relinquish it and only read with him the French language."</p>

<p>He approaches the door which is wide open, and she is
standing directly in front of it with her eyes upon him, but
at which he nevertheless knocks and stands until he is bidden
to enter, when he bows profoundly.</p>

<p>The lady aside: "Truly a most oriental mode of entering
the presence of the royal sex! But it is all very well.
As women are henceforth to take the lead in life, I am glad
that one man's manners are on the whole up to the idea."</p>

<p>"Good morning, ma'am; I come to you in the sublimest
possible mood. After my wanderings of ages and the multiform
experience of fifty centuries' existence in which I
have ever, with a child-like eagerness, clung to some fond
dreams of personal happiness, I have resolved to cast them
to the winds and live for Truth alone."</p>

<p>"A very sensible and pious resolution, and I rejoice that
resignation, that plant, it would seem, of tardy growth
in the harsh soil of a man's nature, has at length flowered
in yours! With women it fructifies almost spontaneously;
the soil, if not so <i>strong</i>, being more mellow and pervious
to skyey influences. Nevertheless I congratulate you.
Better late than never."</p>

<p>"But lo! a strange phenomenon attended the stern sacrifice!
As with a struggle such as divides the soul from our

<!--- vol 1 page 231 -->

corporeal part, and with a gasp of agony I flung them from
me; amazed I saw come trooping towards me the angels
of Hope, of Joy, of Peace and Victory, bearing in their
hands their different symbols, and attended by cherubs,
scattering from golden vases the flowers and perfumes of
the heavenly sphere, so that where I looked to travel
henceforth in the rugged path of self-renunciation, I found
it strewn with roses, and the sweet, heavenly company
awaiting to attend me."</p>

<p>"O yes, that is of course the natural result of yielding
up one's blind, selfish will to the guidance of the wiser
one of the Supreme. Plod on patiently five centuries
longer, and I have no doubt that then this truth will be
thoroughly stamped upon man's nature; that God never
intended that we should live in an exhausted receiver, but
in this living, boundless universe, every part of which will
minister to his health, happiness, and highest good, provided
we journey through life in parallel lines with his
harmonious appointments. Now that you have schooled
yourself to submission to all evils which may await you in
particular and the universe in general, it may be the most
fitting time to announce to you the painful intelligence
that I shall for a time deprive you of the felicity of administering
to the stupidity of a preoccupied mind. I relinquish
the study of Hebrew for the present."</p>

<p>"I cannot listen to your determination for a moment,
madam. Allow me to use the privilege, which my position
as an instructor gives me, and earnestly insist upon your
continuance of the study."</p>

<p>"Your urgency is of no avail, sir. I have sublunary
reasons sufficient to determine me, and besides this, I am
bidden through a friend by the spirits beyond this time-vail,
to keep my mind perfectly passive. I wonder if they
think to <i>impress</i> me against my will? I defy them. So I
shall relinquish the study."</p>

<p>He fixes his eye upon her and says emphatically: "You

<!--- vol 1 page 232 -->

will please read these four pages; you will have no difficulty
in doing it. Keep your mind passive, and this tongue
of Eld, the great medium of God's subtle influence over
the ages, shall enrich your life by its possession. And
what a mine of wealth does it unfold to the waiting soul!
Not through the vulgar, school-boy notion of plenary inspiration,
as if each line and word were a magic spell to keep
the darkened, timid mind in fetters that it go not astray,
leading it into idolatry of ink, parchment, and letter-press,
no less gross and still more crushing to human nature than
that which deifies the elements, the fruits and flowers, the
sun, moon, and planetary bodies, and the ideal of man and
woman; but through its spirit, which is in perfect harmony
with common sense and reason. As in my passage through
the ages I paused in Greece and Rome, and took note of
their Deities&mdash;Jupiter, Minerva, Mercury, Juno, Bacchus,
and Venus&mdash;and thus saw these their thoughts expressed
to the eye in their almost living, breathing works of Art,
though to worship such seemed most unmeet to me, to
whom the one true God has been revealed, yet was I glad
that to any people it was permitted to reveal in its perfection
the wondrous handiwork of God, the human form, the
living temple of his image here on earth. And as I gazed
upon the Muses, beautiful representations of poetic womanhood,
to whom is given in keeping some great Art to teach
and to transmit to coming humanity, I rejoiced that such
broad glimpses were permitted to these early times of her
high mission here below. Surely, thought I, when cometh
the brighter light promised to my people, men will see
clearly that those earth-gods are but the types, the reflections,
the imperfect embodiment of the great idea of a
universal Father, all-wise, all-present, joyous, beautiful,
and loving. And when the truth of the Messiah shall
flower in lovely woman, a tenderer grace shall sit upon her
brow than any that adorned these Muses; for endued with
the true Christian spirit, home, through her affections and

<!--- vol 1 page 233 -->

fidelity, shall be her shrine, from which shall arise her
worship to the Most High, and the hearts of her husband
and children be the Lares to which she will award the
tribute of her life's devotion."</p>

<p>"There has been a failure somewhere, for we are not so
much in advance of the ancients as we ought to be, and as
the whole spirit of Christ's teachings taught us to expect
either in religion, morals, intellectual culture, or physical
development."</p>

<p>"No, the ascetic element so rife in eastern countries,
whose deities are monsters, whose nature is to blast more
than to bless, has ever mixed with Judaism. As soon as
Christianity left the bosom of its founder, in whom dwelt
perfect love of God, invigorated only by a healthful, inspiring
awe, it mingled in his imperfect followers' minds with this
dark stream flowing from the perturbed, bewildered minds
of Jews and Pagans. The Catholic Church, so called, by its
penances and cruel, abominable restraint upon much that
is innocent and beautiful in human nature, and by its bold
assumption, in which glares the spirit of Lucifer, not beams
out the encouraging glance of meek, disinterested, freedom-loving,
liberty-giving Christ, has perpetuated this degrading
principle. And not less grievous and wicked, but more
insidious and life-crushing is the same in the prevalent
Protestantism of the day, dubbed Calvinism, self-nicknamed
Lutheranism, or with the presumptuous title of Orthodoxy,
rolling like a sweet morsel its self-assurance under its blistering
tongue. For it has by its worse than heathen dogmas
darkened our earth's atmosphere, set it awry upon its
axis, wheeled it aside from its proper orbit, so that the
moon's dark side is turned towards it, the spots upon the
sun are so magnified to the world's eye by their false
position as almost to conceal its beams, and the planetary
system and the stars seem not to shine by their heaven-appointed
light, but have the lurid glare of Hell upon their
spheres. O! it is awful that this perversion of the great

<!--- vol 1 page 234 -->

good of life, this connecting, binding link between man
and God, Religion, should be the chain and manacle to
force him to tremble, and it may be curse, while he grinds
out his daily degraded life in the prison-house of his
spirit's bondage."</p>

<p>"Yes, bondage it is, as the faces of its willing captives
indicate; for they are full of unnatural lines and sad grimaces,
as if heaven were to be propitiated by the disfigurement
of his most perfect work, 'the human face divine.'
I was looking to-day at some representations of the Nine
Muses. They were beautiful in their full, harmonious development,
and their expression of serenity and joy, as they
stood with the emblems of their art in hand, indicating both
their mission on the earth, and the delight it gave them to
fulfill it. I then turned to a volume on Sacred and Legendary
Art, with delineations of the Christian saints, martyrs,
priests, and principal nuns of the middle ages. These,
almost without exception, had the downcast, anxious, agonized
expression of poor victims to the wrath of some
avenging deity, and I closed the volume in disgust and sorrow
that a religion so full of joy, peace, bright hopes,
thrilling memories and glad anticipations should thus be
represented by its believers so as to make the unthinking
and superficial say: 'See how much better humanity throve
under the former than the latter faith!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I range myself side by side with those whom
you call shallow, and say that the idea of religion given by
these ascetics, through assuming to be the only recipients
of God's truth, is lower, as it is more unnatural than even
the excesses of the old idolaters, inasmuch as love, joy, and
free abandonment to nature, though it may merge in lust,
is better than hatred, persecution, hard-hearted, Pharisaical
assumption, the sneer of bigotry, and selfish love of power.
If either of these were the only true representations of
Divinity on earth, I go back to the ancients."</p>

<p>"Nay; but there is a strength of will, a command over

<!--- vol 1 page 235 -->

the baser passions, an invigoration of nature attained by
those who believe in Christianity, even if mingled with the
popular theology, unknown of old. The stern law is necessary
to hush the lions and tigers of our souls to due obedience,
before the singing birds and flowers which Christianity
developes in us, can find a safe, fitting bower and
garden to chant and bloom in. The simple majesty of law
is sadly smothered by false traditions, it is true; yet for all
that, there is more of it still in action to nerve us than the
ancients had. Were there no sins and persecution, no
bigotry and assumption then? History is not written aright
if these were not rampant, even worse than now."</p>

<p>"Look at Sebastopol; read the list of its hecatombs of
slain; measure the humanity of Protestant England, who
suffers thousands of her best and bravest to die rather than
overstep a miserable conventionalism; see Catholic France
lying so low within the toils of the spoiler as to suffer its
life-blood to be daily drained that its tyrant may, concealed
by the smoke and din of the battle, forge her chains more
surely; and say, whether the asceticism of the nineteenth
century has more of the love of God and humanity in it
than the mirth, and free scope given to nature by the Pagan
idolatry."</p>

<p>"O, but does not a protest, never heard by the ancients,
arise from the universal Christian nations against these
horrid butcheries, set on foot by a few selfish despots,
whom Providence, for inscrutable reasons, permits to wield
powers which they shamefully abuse? And this protest
will be heard, for it is the last war ever to be waged again
by Christendom."</p>

<p>"Do you believe it?"</p>

<p>"Most sincerely."</p>

<p>"Meantime, I wage my battle against the dark doctrines
of the prevalent theologies. Born into this my latest transformation
under the Talmud's rigid sway, nurtured, nay
half starved, body and soul, by a grandsire, Pharisaical,

<!--- vol 1 page 236 -->

covetous and cruel, whose dire conformity to false traditions
made his whole nature like a pool, stagnant and
fetid; my being would have been poisoned had it not been
for one backward glimpse, half faded but ever cherished
of a most sweet and saintly father, who died before my
infant eyes could fix themselves with steady glance upon his
reverent face and form. That gleam shed on my pathway
from his angel-sphere conducted me to Jesus, in whose
perfected truth I saw the flowering of my people's faith, the
consummation of the law of Moses, for which <i>that</i> was
a preparation and a prophecy, and <i>this</i> the seal of the significance
of all its rules, and rites, and ceremonies. So
that in early youth the Christ became my ideal of human
perfection, and this gradually led me to become his follower.
But after groping through a dismal Jewish boyhood,
it was by no flowery paths that I have reached what I
believe his simple truth. For into the 'wild woods' of the
superstitious, popular theology I plunged where there is but
a doubtful glimmer of light here and there to tempt the
wanderer on his journey. But on and on I waded through
thickets of speculations, through briery paths of discouragement
and doubt until I found the elevated plain where
beautiful Truth stands fully revealed, beckoning me on and
on towards the source of its Eternal spring."</p>

<p>"And now, having inflated yourself with this sublime
element, balloon-like you are sailing from one nation to
another down the ages, dispensing as is needed of this
ethereal gas with which you and your car are charged?
Does not Father Time get tired of seeing you following
his footsteps all these years? He is more lenient to you
than to me, or he would scowl at you and say: 'Don't
think to defy me, look at the wrinkles upon your face,
signs all that my sickle is sharpening to reap you low.' "</p>

<p>"I defy him until I have given to the world proofs of
their gross idolatry in worshiping the <i>letter</i> of the Bible in
no less than one thousand discrepancies within its pages.

<!--- vol 1 page 237 -->

showing how vain it is for men to trust their salvation to
anything so shifting as human language."</p>

<p>"You will not be understood. The Priests and Levites
will say that you are an infidel and scoff at Revelation."</p>

<p>"Let them say whatever their bigotry and lust for power
suggest; if these motives prompt them to reckless denunciation
of all utterance which squares not with their pigmy
rules. To God I commend my cause, who knows that it is
not because I love the Scriptures less but more, that I
seek to tear from their simple majesty all lying pretensions,
patched upon them by foolish, ignorant men, that they
may stand forth as they truly are, the <i>record of a revelation
to be studied, judged of, and obeyed with the same
reason and common sense wherewith nature, man, the
earth and its concerns, and our own characters and actions
are weighed.</i>"</p>

<p>"I hope the world will be ready to read your book, for
it is sadly in need of its truths. It likes the positive, however,
better than the negative; for its feelings and imagination
are in advance of its reason and religious principles,
so it is careless of laying its foundations deep on the rock
of truth, but is forever putting new turrets to its apex, and
thus it topples over continually."</p>

<p>"Yes, the positive truth is to save the world, but before
its basis is thoroughly established, it must see clearly what
its enemies have been in the past, and conquer and lay
them low in the dust. This is my present work."</p>

<p>"And I take the positive. Can I not, presumptuous
woman that I am, lend you a helping hand in your hard
drudgery. Supposing I advertise your work in the Tale
which I am writing, so that if it should fail of descending
far down the vale from its own lack of the life-principle, its
memory may still be perpetuated through mine.</p>

<p class="small">(<i>Aside</i>.)</p>

<p>("He frowns, I see, at that. What being in the likeness
of man, though he have the wisdom of the ages, ever

<!--- vol 1 page 238 -->

thought a woman could do anything for him but cook, sew,
please and <i>comfort</i>, and amuse him in some humdrum
way?)</p>

<p>"For I write for nothing less than immortality. Or do
you intend to outlive the world and keep fast hold of your
book in your peregrinations, and so secure its life?"</p>

<p>"I know not what may be before me. I live for truth,
and take no anxious thought for the future. But in dreams
of night, amid the hush of the city's roar and tumult, when
my clairvoyant eye is couched by the subtlest element of
nature, and under the greenwood tree when time and
space are annihilated and I live in the eternal Present,
there come to me visions of cool waters in the distant
future, bathing my feverish, aching brow&mdash;glimmerings of
ambrosia fit to nourish the divinities, freed from all corporeal
substance, and sweet visions of the peace of God
shed upon my weary, suffering heart of eld, yet ever
young in its sense of agony and striving with itself and the
all-present powers of evil. I will be patient, yet I know
that happiness will, in the end, lift her coy face and smile
her sweetest even on me."</p>

<p>"I hope so. It would be nuptials worthy of publication:
'Married, the Rev. Everlasting, Restless, Suffering, Wandering,
Unbelieving Jud&aelig;us to Miss Serene, Loving, Quiet,
Gospel Felicitas. The blissful pair have taken up their
abode in the Valley of Christian Contentment, and the

his low mournful cry about our dwellings of the 'old
ra-ags, ra-ags!' of Judaism, no less than at their joyful
prospects.' "</p>

<p>"Good morning, madam; I will return to-morrow at this
same hour and hear you read your lesson."</p>

<p class="small">(<i>The pastor's wife alone</i>.)</p>

<p>"Verily a strange mixture of all the ages is this weird,
mysterious man, and for this he interests me. My truant
fancy, ever striving to release itself from conventionalism,

<!--- vol 1 page 239 -->

has full sweep with one whom do age, country, or narrow
sect can bind; and yet, with the freedom breathed
from a rarer atmosphere than what envelopes other
men, he preserves a strict integrity of mind and manners.
My husband has his female friends, sweet, gentle,
loving souls, who have grown up within our heart
of hearts, some of them in the sacred inclosure of our
home. We love them both alike; for jealousy! why
it is a word not known in our vocabulary, so trustful
are we of each other; and when they meet and part
from him, it is with a sister's and brother's kiss of welcome
and farewell. And they write to him, 'So glad were
we to see your dear face again.' But I have had no friend
of his sex with whom I could think aloud, and though a
broad sweep of my being is met by his, not all is exercised.
For his life is full of grave cares and labors, and though
with marvelous power he frees himself of the dust and
cobwebs of the study when he comes to me; yet soon he
hies away to scatter his sympathies and gather an unnatural
weight of solicitude from the multitudes, who find no
friend so gentle as he to listen to their woes. And so it
happens that while the world's anxious, sorrowful ones
pour into his ear their tales of bereavement, sickness, or
mayhap worldly trials and vexations, and never in vain, my
soul goes ranging alone through perilous paths of questioning
and denial of what the sages have settled as finalities;
and Fancy, its butterfly, now flutters in dangerous proximity
to the sun, scorching its gauzy wings, till scared at its
dizzy, solitary soarings, it crouches low, dimmed and disconsolate,
folding its pinions, and sighing for the dull, dark
safety of its imprisoned, grub-life, then spreads them with
a bolder, stronger sweep to gather sunlight and fervid heat
from upper regions, which even his pure eye has not yet
penetrated.</p>

<p>"But this man of the ages has been there before me, and I
see that into these regions we can soar in meet companionship.

And now, were I a young, undisciplined girl, and did
not love my husband with a strong and true affection, and did
not <i>know</i> that he was given me by my Maker who read the
temper of his child, and fashioned its fit training and due
measure of earthly love, and if I had not long ago given
all feelings not intended to be met by earthly friend into
his keeping, who, with interest, richly has repaid me, then
I might suffer a crude and a foolish sentiment to usurp the
place of the true gold of a wife's love and duty. But
strong in the might of God's support, my love, and clear
perception of the beauty of the right, and direful consequence
of wrong, let me, through imagination, gather
some truth for the well-being of others less favored than
myself. Let me, if I may become the interpreter of my
sex and keeping fast hold of the anchor let down from
heaven and fastened deep in time, cast a clear and steady
gaze into the awful pit, ten thousand fathoms deep, where
lie buried the virtue and happiness of frail women, beguiled
and led astray by the bewitching cant about twin soulship,
psychological completeness of sympathy, sealed marriages
and spiritual wifehood, Cicisbeoism, and all other deceitful
forms of breaking a commandment written on our hearts,
and in God's word by him who made us singly, as well as
gave us into each other's keeping in social bonds. And
now I will reason, as many an unfortunate must do, before
she oversteps the line of duty to herself and God.</p>

<p>"My husband regards me not, or if he does, it is with
such cool indifference and rude sense of ownership, that
my soul is starved for sympathy or blasted by injustice.
Here is his friend, who has leisure, gentle manners and love
for my society, and wooes my confidence by his religious
aspirations and high-toned thoughts. He seeks my friendship;
gradually hints that we have tastes in common not
shared with me by my more busy, practical husband, proposes
a spiritual union, which shall lift us to the third heaven
of purest bliss. Gradually grosser thoughts steal unawares

<!--- vol 1 page 241 -->

upon me. The laws and customs of society war against
the natural love of tender hearts. Was not Jesus lenient
to the poor, lost woman, while he rebuked her accusers, no
doubt steeped in the same guilt themselves, but, as now,
mean, base, and profligate enough to seek to cover their
own shame by exposing and scorning hers? But in the
Holy One she found a friend; and shall not I in this my
life's extremity?</p>

<p>"And so she falls <i>low, lower, lowest</i> in the scale of our
humanity. O woman, flower of the earth, if virtuous,
fruit ripest for the skies, whom, if wicked, thy keen,
wounded sense of the ruin of the angel in thee drives to
demoniac madness and fierce desperation! let me unravel
for thee, my poor, tempted, deluded sister, the tangled
skein of thy troubled, flying, fascinated thoughts, and
in few words point to the remedy.</p>

<p>"But what is this strange feeling that steals over me,
as if my being were parting asunder? Can it be death,
and I in fullest health but now? Or can it be that the
weird man has dared to throw over me the subtle influence
of magnetism; me who have shunned all drugs of
narcotic and alleviating influence, so that my spirit might
be free and natural in its workings?&mdash;over me, whom mingled
disgust, pity, and indignation have long since driven
from all haunts in which its daring votaries exhibit to the
gaping multitude&mdash;some, their power over the individual
will, and others, their weak submission to those who wield
the powerful element. Let me bethink myself. Yesterday,
in the absorption of our lesson, I recall to mind that, for a
moment, my robe came in contact with his arm. And
could he thus transmit the potent fluid? And in the afternoon
my half hour's siesta was so profound that I seemed
to have slept through ages. I remember, too, his frequent
calls upon my husband; some strange tale to draw him to
his dwelling; some cabalistic secrecy attending it; some
unwonted questionings of my tale-telling. Has he <i>dared</i> to

<!--- vol 1 page 242 -->

exercise his magic on <i>me</i>, God's child and nature's prot&eacute;g&eacute;,
whose principles and whose instincts alone have guided
me since the first day they laid me in my mother's arms
within this earth-pale, sealing upon my infant brow their
baptismal mark, the blazing star? Has he dared to attempt
to mingle his being by the mesmeric touch with that of <i>my
husband's wife?</i> Does he know how much this means&mdash;
<i>my husband's wife?</i> Even this. Of all men on the wide
earthy <i>he</i> is the only, only one whose love, whose due
sense of power and of my right, whose claim upon my
affection and obedience have been so justly balanced that
I have been allowed a true development, and thus with only
him I could have lived in wedlock and not be prostitute.
This I learn through the marvelous power of a sympathy
with other minds, known only to her, reposing in nature's
loving arms, who, while she broods over her as the dove
over its young in cooing accents, tells her her secrets,
while mother and child bathe in the eternal, benignant
smile of 'our great Father.'</p>

<p>"I tread upon your power, thou impotent conjurer! get
thee behind me, Satan! you offend me by your pretensions
and miserable attempt at despotism! I'll breathe the open
air. Come, ye breezes, and blow from the top of Lebanon's
mount and cleanse me from the unwelcome gift
forced on me by thy country's degenerate son! I tear my
robe from off me, and cast it into the purifying waters
fathoms deep, that it drown out its sinful participation in
the deed. I faint&mdash;I die. Come, my husband, and fold
your protecting arms about me, and let me sleep against
your heart-pulse that it may hold your own away from the
Death-angel's grasp, whose chilly breath comes faintly to
me through the portal, half-opened by that tampering
Jew."</p>

<p>The next day the Pastor's wife, pale yet resolute,
awaits the magnetizer's usual visit</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 243 -->

<p class="small">(<i>He enters</i>.)</p>

<p>"Good morning, madam. You are surely ill."</p>

<p>"It is the truth. Ask me not the nature of my disease,
for I mistake me, or ye know it well. Confess, sir, that
you used the mysterious influence, you wield, to magnetize
me."</p>

<p>"I did. There are different temperaments so naturally
attuned, that by the influence of the subtle magnetic fluid
strange harmonies may be awakened, so that two beings
become blended into one. In our sentiments, and tastes,
and life-experiences, so far as different ages justify, there
seemed a wondrous unison, and for a reason which now I
will not name, I sought to ascertain the extent of our dual
unity. But some resistance has come between us, unaccountable
to my weird vision."</p>

<p>"And you dare to confess all this to me, your equal, ay,
your superior so far as a teachable spirit which gives clear
insight into the laws of life can make me so? You, who
have fought for your country's freedom, who plead the
captive's cause, and defend the oppressed, can stoop so
low, it seems, as to seek to cast your spell over a trusting
woman's soul and person, and try to read her secret
thoughts by a mean trick of jugglery!"</p>

<p>"I stand condemned; what farther say ye?"</p>

<p>"I grant ye an intellect, critical, inquisitive, and subtle,
an artist-eye, and a poetic soul, with learning gathered
from the deeps profound of eastern science and western
schools of rare and curious knowledge, and an insight into
the souls of men with power to wield their sympathies seldom
attained; but into that of woman ye have read no farther
than the alphabet, and one, who claims the title to be
<i>Psyche of her sex</i>, pronounces you a <i>hypocrite</i>, inasmuch
as ye in the same hour seek to enlighten and to darken, to
free and to enchain, to awaken her to larger views of
nature and its Author and to drown her in a sleep imposed
by your unlawful tyranny. But I discard your power."</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 244 -->

<p class="small">(<i>He rises to leave</i>.)</p>

<p>"Madam, our usual order is reversed. I stand the
instructed, and you the teacher are. I acknowledge my
mistake."</p>

<p>"I do not decide against your character by a single untoward
action. I wait to see if your errors be not the
consequence of a defective training, of an early, superstitious
faith, the brambles and briers brought from the 'wild
woods' of false theologies, sticking even to one who strives
for the highest truth; but if ye ever repeat the attempt to
subdue my will, to reveal my mind to your too curious
scrutiny in this unhallowed way, and above all, to make my
pure, noble, and loving husband the puppet of your capricious
will in this design, I'll scorn you like an imp of hell.
For I would as soon clasp hands with a fiend and turn my
face straight towards the under-world, as carelessly to join
myself by means of magnetism to one whom I had not, by
long and tried companionship, read through and through,
who did not use the power invested in him with the same
holy sense of responsibility with which the Christ performed
his miracles. And know this, O presumptuous
man I that for the amusement of a passing hour ye may
wield an influence given you to bless with, as a temptation
and a curse to some one who, sad and solitary, climbs up
a steep and stony way; who in glad innocence may yield
a hand to one who seems able to lead her across life's precipices,
but who, instead of replying to her confidence,
throws her among the lions. Beware, beware of the evil
that lurks, as it may seem, in flowers and music, and may,
like ravenous beasts, tear your own soul if not another's."</p>

<p class="small">(<i>He moves with sad and repentant aspect towards the door</i>.)</p>

<p>"I leave you. Forgive the injury, forget the lonely
wanderer who, from no baseness, but a pure desire for a
spiritual friendship hitherto denied him, sought through a
means, by God appointed as I deemed, to win the blessing
from you. For in starlight visions in the desert, it was

<!--- vol 1 page 245 -->

revealed to me that, far west of Sinai's heights, I should
discover the twin complement of my soul, and this sign of
dual unity sealed between us should be the test to guide
me to her. This I found in you. Mother, sister, wife are
all denied me, and miserable that I am! this more ethereal
boon I have now lost by a too eager grasp. Farewell!"</p>

<p class="small">(<i>She rises</i>.)</p>

<p>"Do we understand each other?"</p>

<p>"Ay."</p>

<p>"And do my words seem just and reasonable to you?"</p>

<p>"Even so."</p>

<p>"Then we will give the usual sign of friendship, (clasping
hands), and you will be a brother in the same great
cause to which my husband and I have pledged ourselves,
a safe inmate in our family, a friend to rely upon, not a
wizard to guard against."</p>

<p>"I pledge myself."</p>

<p>"And now we know the meaning of a <i>spiritual friendship</i>,
which shall liken us to the angels of God in heaven.
<i>A common zeal and mutual labor in the great cause of
humanity and truth; sanctifying all life's aims, labor, mental
culture and beautiful tastes;</i> holding in unbroken unity
and awful sacredness, the ties of husband and wife; superadding
it may be a third, companionship in open faith
avowed and with his full approval, in which each shall
draw from the other all that is loveliest and rarest from our
souls, while the triennial chain shall never rust in either
link, but grow brighter and brighter unto the perfect day,
when there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage, but
all are as angels of God in heaven."</p>

<p>"I hear the voices of Lina and
Mr. K&ouml;rner coming up the yard. I
will read this chapter of my Tale
to them, and see if they approve
it. They give me right cordial encouragement
in my work, but tremble
a little for my free pen. I fear
that this will startle them&mdash;Hilda
and Zo&euml;, too! and better still, the little three-year-old.
You are welcome, friends; be seated, pray. And seeing

<!--- vol 1 page 247 -->

that my larder is unfurnished with dainties for your refreshment,
shall I give you a tit-bit from my romance? or are
you not in the mood for it?"</p>

<p>"O yes," said all at once; "pray give it us."</p>

<p>"I like to see your progress; go on, you will be read,
never fear," said Mr. K&ouml;rner.</p>

<p>"When are we to be immortalized, dear Lisbet?" said
Mrs. K&ouml;rner, "for I see your fashion is to serve us up for
the benefit of the public."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am acting upon your motto, 'make your friends
useful as well as ornamental.' Do you feel damaged
thereby?"</p>

<p>"O no! I like myself very well, idealized as I am. But
are you sure that every one you dress up in this way will?"</p>

<p>"I have not asked them. They must get used to it.
My revelations are nothing to what will be made of them
at the day of judgment, when we shall know as we are
known. Won't that be a glorious time?"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! a woman's heaven that, where her curiosity
will be fully gratified. But why don't you imagine characters,
or take them from a greater distance? Novelists
usually do, I believe," said Mr. K&ouml;rner.</p>

<p>"O you and a few others are good enough for me; only
tip you off with a little glory here and there, excepting
you, however, who do very well just as you are. But paint
people at a distance! What a question? Did you ever
know an artist stand a thousand miles off from the subject of
his sketch? You think I am a witch, do you, brother mine?
Imagine, create characters! What a wicked thought! God
only does that. What are you thinking of? I must use
for my story what he has made for me, and be very thankful
that he allowed me to be born and to live with such
interesting people. So you may consider yourself as predestined
to shine in this way from all eternity; for I am
compelled, by the exacting spirit that strives within my
little person to write a book, so here you all are."</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 248 -->

<p>"What you just now said reminds me," said Hilda, "of
what Miss Ingemann told us yesterday, that women were
not creative in the character of their minds, only imitative;
that men were the inventors."</p>

<p>"Worthy of Miss Ingemann's farsighted wisdom! Excuse
me, Hilda. She is not the only one in these hard
times whose cold, steel point of an intellect pierces the
eyes of their <i>souls</i> out so that they live and grope about
in mental and spiritual blindness. Is not that a paradox?
There is a certain volume somewhere, which says 'that
men have sought out many inventions,' and don't speak of
it as much to their credit either. I agree, they are <i>very
inventive</i>. It is enough for the women to imitate, combine,
arrange, group, and show off to good advantage, by the
gift of their idealism and common-sense, the materials
which a good God has strewn abundantly around in life,
history, and nature, and in that way they stick to the <i>truth</i>,
which is what we were made to live for in this universe.
Men want to build a world of their own, and so they set
about <i>inventing</i>, and they make poor work of it, seeing
they cannot fly out of themselves, or get entirely away
from the rule of their Maker, try as hard as they may;
but they have contrived thus much, to turn the world topsy-turvy
with their abortive attempts at <i>creation</i>. But the
women will set it all right in time; let them have free
scope."</p>

<p>"But when is this happy revolution to be made? for I
suppose you date it from the publication of your book."</p>

<p>"O! of course. That depends upon my publisher. I
see he dreads to throw up the reins of government himself,
as well as to see them drop from the hands of his fellows,
so he delays. If he were not a man of honor he
would, I fear, burn my manuscript; but being such, he
contents himself with keeping back my proof-sheets, telling
me something like this, that my Tale is not of much
account. But I will now give you my last chapter."</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 249 -->

<p class="small">(<i>She reads it throughout</i>.)</p>

<p>"Lisbet, you frighten me," said Mrs. K&ouml;rner. "What
does this mean? Were you thus insulted by your teacher?"
(looking very serious.)</p>

<p>"My dear Lina, you are as literal as I was the other
day when you asked me if I had 'Bacon,' and I answered
that I had some in brine, when you meant the great English
writer! No, surely not, to my knowledge. You still
look doubtful; then, for the first time in my life, <i>I swear</i>
that he has ever treated me with the respect due from one
Christian to another. Why, you make me blush that it can
seem possible to you that I should be treated thus. My
husband never doubted me in his life. Don't you see my
drift? I had to write a chapter upon some of the new notions
of the day&mdash;magnetism, psychological twinship, etc.,
etc., and I naturally wished to make it a little thrilling, and
I have a foolish fashion born with me, of thinking in petty
dramas. So I just wrote down one of them as it bubbled
up in my mind, and it frightens, when I thought only of
amusing you. For <i>you</i> do not need the moral. I am
sorry."</p>

<p>"But really I think you are too hard on Mr. Se&uuml;ll, an
exile, and alone in the world, as he says he is."</p>

<p>"An <i>exile!</i> well, all the better. It gives him an opportunity
to make new acquaintances. <i>Alone, aloney,</i> he
says, does he? I had hoped there was one man in the
world of sensibility and genius who did not fancy himself
<i>peculiar</i>, but would take everything in the shape of trial
and training as a matter of course, as it comes along&mdash;in
short, who begins life, expecting nothing, thinking he
deserves but little, and then whatever favors come to him
he regards as so much clear gain and is thankful accordingly.
I hope, at least, he did not berate the world, because,
forsooth, it did not <i>appreciate him?</i>"</p>

<p>"His conversation squinted that way once or twice; but
he did not enlarge upon the subject."</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 250 -->

<p>"Do you think Mr. Se&uuml;ll is self-conceited?" said Hilda.
"Rinda does."</p>

<p>"Not particularly so. All men are, you know. Of
course they must be from their self-imposed position, having
arranged themselves since time was, on an elevated platform,
with the women all below, who are bidden to look
up to them as <i>superior, stronger, more creative, independent,
worthy to receive due wages for their labor, the favored
recipients for all the wine of life,</i> which froths to
the full brim."</p>

<p>"While your sex are destined to cook, <i>sew for</i>, and <i>comfort</i>
them, that comes next," said Mr. K&ouml;rner. "Lisbet,
you are falling into <i>cant;</i> don't repeat that again."</p>

<p>"No, for you seem to have learned the lesson. But,
seriously, I except you <i>almost</i> entirely. And, as for my
husband&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He is not self-conceited," said Hilda.</p>

<p>"No, not much&mdash;a trifle so now and then. But I
forbear to check him, for he is so faultless now that he
half loses his transcendental labor, preaching to this degenerate
age. So don't tell him, Hilda, for he would immediately
set about reforming. I don't like perfect people,
and I am sure the world is not good enough for such."</p>

<p>"But this Mr. Se&uuml;ll, Lisbet, I don't quite like his giving
you lessons," said Mr. K&ouml;rner. "A Hungarian, a
countryman of Kossuth, your demigod; rather dangerous
for my enthusiastic little sister. What does your husband
say?"

<p>"My husband! Surely he asked him to teach me
Hebrew. Why, he lets me do just what I please, and in
return I take every hint from him as an inspiration. The
other day, I dared to differ from him upon some verbal
matter in my 'Story,' and wrote it according to my taste
rather than his; but I lie awake nights about it, and so I
have got to hunt it up, for I have forgotten it, it was so
trifling, and change it according to his decision. That is

<!--- vol 1 page 251 -->

what wives do, who have their freedom. Don't hinder
Lina, if she ever takes a fancy to be <i>strong-minded</i> and
<i>have her rights</i>, for only so will she give you yours."</p>

<p>"As every right brings with it a duty, I have as many
now as I can respond to," said Mrs. K&ouml;rner; "I do not
wish for more."</p>

<p>"Mr. Se&uuml;ll speaks of his critical work to some of our
young men, the young elect, as you and Theresa call them,
and they make themselves merry about it and his numerous
corrections," said Mr. K&ouml;rner.</p>

<p>"O! I suppose so, of course. No doubt <i>he</i> would come
in for a share of their ridicule, as nothing escapes their
carping criticism. He has not had time since he came into
Anglo-Saxondom to learn to be 'as wise as a serpent,' as I
have, with the brilliant but shallow spirits of the time, and
keep his generous designs for humanity for those who would
deem them not fanatical, but pitched to a tune higher than
the contralto voices around us can express; designs which
will swell the song of the millennial day, and be the <i>common</i>
sentiment of souls made glorious through truth. So much
do I distrust the judgment of any clique, who sip daintily
here and there at every new rivulet which bursts out from
hillside or glen, gathering a few sparkling drops to glitter
upon their pericraniums, leaving the great ocean and the
mighty rivers where they could learn their own specific
gravity, and be humble, and gather from their generous
depths to fill their belittled souls, that when they utter
their shrewd dicta, I turn instinctively to the opposite pole
of thought for the probable sanction of the truth revealed
to the docile pupil of the ages. Jesus not only gathered
up the knowledge and wisdom of all time to guide him
and prepare him to be the Christ, but paused at the rites
and symbols of his people&mdash;those sure landmarks by which
to judge the fidelity of discipleship to the good, the fair,
and beautiful&mdash;ever the same, standing before us in contrast
to the shifting waves of speculation, which make strange

<!--- vol 1 page 252 -->

inroads into the solid earth-banks. Such has been this
Hungarian's coarse, ever breaking the fetters cast about
him, deeming of little value the already attained, so that
with strong grasp, he reaches after the truth beyond, while
sign and ceremony give to his poetic soul the refining
grace denied to those who, mole-eyed, see not their great
significance. Look on this picture and then on that, and
note well that the one will be revealed as the poet-critic,
the child-philosopher, the Christian hero and patriot, and
inspired divine; while the others, banished from the pinnacle
on which an unsanctified imagination has self-exalted
them, with penitent, willing hearts must return even as far
back as the <i>two tables</i> for the religious strength of character
they lack. And then it will seem plain to them, that
sinking all petty differences of opinion, it is better, shoulder
to shoulder, to do our part, to bear the ark of God
along the centuries, than to slink away to fondle and hug
to souls, into whom leanness enters more and more, an
<i>ism</i>, an <i>ophy</i>, or an <i>ology.</i></p>

<p>"As for Mr. Se&uuml;ll, I fear not his displeasure for being
made a victim by an illustration, indited with the intent of
doing good, for he is Hungarian, which means noble; a
Jew, which means acute in reading hidden meanings; a
Christian, which makes him universal; and a German,
which means <i>gemuthlich</i>&mdash;so much that is rare and excellent
that it cannot be translated."</p>

<p>"You have a high opinion of him, Lisbet. I have failed
to see all this in him," said Lina.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. K&ouml;rner; "these foreigners one knows
but little about. You may as well be careful in trusting
them."</p>

<p>"A foreigner, say you, and one of your own countrymen!
That is like you Germans, forever talking of dear
fatherland and sighing for the reunion of her principalities
into one glorious commonwealth, and yet doing nothing
to effect it. You do not wish for freedom nor reunion, else

<!--- vol 1 page 253 -->

you exiles would band together more in the expression of
a great central sentiment, even Christian toleration and
good-will. Instead of that, you stand far aloof from each
other with a microscope in either hand, so that you need
not miss a single point of difference between you, gathering
all such together to build a high wall of separation,
preventing all cordial effort in laboring for Germany."</p>

<p>"What is the use of trying for anything; it would do no
good, and only make us miserable, by stirring up useless
regrets," said Mr. K&ouml;rner.</p>

<p>"You have no faith, more than our physician and good
friend. It is not every one who, in seeking medical aid
can summon Poet, Philosopher, Reformer, and Doctor all
in one; and yet, of what use is all this glory, for when
my husband is ill, though I know he has beautiful boxes
of <i>Idealistic Pills</i>, which I dare say would cure him, so
little faith has he in their efficacy, that ten to one, he does
not give him salts and senna, or filthy calomel and jalap,
pah! So it is, I fear, with his treatment of his country.
He gives it the bitter dose of sighs and tears, and keeps
the heroic to himself. I see I shall have to take the matter
in hand. I daresay I shall do more for your fatherland
than either of you, with all your wailing."</p>

<p>"Go on. It may be that you will, I'll not hinder you."</p>

<p>"Who is your illustrator?" said Mr. K&ouml;rner, turning
over a blank-book, in which were specimens of his art.
"He seems to have genius."</p>

<p>"That figure of Tyranny," said Zo&euml;, "is very spirited
and expressive; how did you find one to suit you so well,
in this department of your work?"</p>

<p>"O! in true woman's fashion, Zo&euml;; just as you would
have done. In one of my prowling excursions about the
city, in which I drop into this picture-shop and that toy-store,
looking for suggestions here and there, and everywhere
my truancy happens to lead me, I was walking
along Dritte-street, and I chanced to look up at the third

<!--- vol 1 page 254 -->

story of a building, and saw this sign&mdash;Lovie, Landscape
Painter, General Illustrator, and Designer; Bauerle, Artist.
Thinks I to myself, that is just what I want; an Illustrator
for my 'Way,' so I began to interpret. Lovie! so far, so
good. If a man has moral courage enough to call himself
thus in these times, when 'Hatie,' 'Fightie,' 'Slanderie,'
'I am-better-than-youie,' 'Down-with-youie,' are
the favorite cognomens, he must be the right one for me.
'General Illus.' etc. Surely if he can touch up the
universe in general, with his art, he can my little book:
better still&mdash;'Designer!' Then he is not a mere copyist
with no ideality. Heaven deliver me from such! Another
recommendation, 'Bauerle, Artist!' If his partner preserves
enough of the scent of the pine woods and green
fields when he gets to dry, dusty, legal Dritte-street, so as to
remember to call himself the 'Bower,' it is all I need.
I'll forthwith mount skyward. So I did, following one
staircase after another, until I saw the name repeated on a
door at the end of the passage. I knocked and entered,
without waiting for it to be opened, not exactly knowing the
etiquette of business-houses. One young man sat at a table,
writing or drawing, with his hat on. 'That must be the
'le Bower,' ' thought I, 'he keeps it on as a symbol, lest
he forget his rural name in these brick walls. The other
at his desk, a pale young man with gentle mien, arose to
greet me.</p>

<p>" 'Mr. Lovie?' " said I.</p>

<p>" 'That is my name.' "</p>

<p>" 'You illustrate books?' "</p>

<p>" 'I do.' "</p>

<p>" 'Will you mine?' "</p>

<p>" 'I will.' "</p>

<p>" 'And give me lessons in drawing?' "</p>

<p>" 'Even so.' "</p>

<p>" 'Please call at my house to-morrow morning.' "</p>

<p>" 'At eight o'clock?' "</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 255 -->

<p>" 'Precisely.' And so with a few more words, showing
some ignorance on my part, of technical rules, we separated.
The next day he came, with a little fear and suspicion
in his aspect. I imagined, as he was bidden to mount
the staircase at such unwonted summons, but which were
dissipated as he found me no deluding cheat, and he does
my work promptly, gladly and with appreciation as a Poet-Artist
should, which proves to me that my mode of doing
business is a very good one."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha! But, my little sister, that is not quite
the thing. Why did you not let your husband make
the engagement? It is more proper for him to settle these
matters for you."</p>

<p>"No, not while you and all the other strong men in our
parish pile most of your religious work on his shoulders,
until I see he begins to totter under the cruel load. I am
not the one to add to his labors more than is possible, but
am going to take care of myself. Three hundred and fifty
husbands, wives, and children are too much for one man,
even if he were the grand Sultan of the Turks. I vacate
the spiritual harem and walk independently henceforth,
until a better order of things is established. Besides, Mr.
Liebenhoff was out of town just at the moment when my
business must be attended to. He was gone, you know, to
the yearly <i>Souls' Fair</i>, as your solitary purveyor in religious
matters, hoping to get some celestial eye-water and heavenly
ear-salve and angelic tonic to waken you up and cure
your deafness and arouse your sleepy members altogether,
for he is tired of repeating the siege of Sebastopol every
Sabbath in his pulpit. I want him to disband the cavalry
and artillery and give the infantry into my charge for a
little time, and he will soon see what we will do. But he
never acts rashly, you know, and believes less in revolution
than amelioration; so he is reviewing the regiment,
proclaiming freedom and equal rights to foot soldiers as
well as officers, and goes on attacking the enemy with new

<!--- vol 1 page 256 -->

courage. I follow after with my little fife and drum, saying,
bravo! <i>sotto voce</i>, and carrying my own knapsack,
meantime, except when he <i>insists</i> upon relieving me."</p>

<p>"Good! you will conquer, I think. We are a rude and
lazy set of fellows to deal with, sure enough. But it is
a minister's work to attend to these matters; we have
enough else to do. But in what light are you going to
introduce our friend, Mr. Kuhn, to the world in your
Tale?"</p>

<p>"I have not made up my mind, whether to leave him to
the judgment of his own awakened conscience for prizing
it so lightly, or to steal that pretty little horse of his which
he drives too fast; for I have a compassionate consideration
for his future some thousands of years hence, when the
soul-spark in the poor animal, after passing through all
inferior metamorphoses, shall bloom into a beautiful young
lady in the heaven-sphere. Supposing that he should be
sailing along at the rate of a thousand leagues a minute,
upon a thunder-cloud edged with <i>tin</i>, which, you know,
shines pretty brightly and is so useful to you men that I
do not think you can <i>ever</i> do without it; and he should see
seated on the point of a rainbow, a bright and radiant sky-nymph,
clad in a robe made of the brilliant day-dawn, with
a zone around her waist cut from the bow of promise,
with diamonds in her hair and on her breast, and arms
crystallized from Sirius, such as Hilda loves; and he
should say, 'Come, take a sail with me.' Now if the fair
nymph were <i>&agrave; la she</i>, would not the witty answer be; 'I
thank you&mdash;no, I have learned better than to consort with
you, my one-time master, my equal, may-be, now. I know
not but in passing the <i>Yard and Ell</i> you would snap it in
two and use it for <i>Bits</i> to guide me, or snatch the comet's
tail to switch me with; or, if I paused a moment out of
breath, the twinkling of the stars as stirrups you would
force to do your bidding; or, at best, in passing by Saturn's
rings, whose refreshing waters I pant and ask for to quench

<!--- vol 1 page 257 -->

my thirst, 'Get up, gee-ho,' would all the answer be.' And
would she not serve him rightly by this tart speech, think
you? and would he not be sorry? Or, if like Zo&euml; were the
nymph, as tones of softest flute she would breathe her
reply, while like a mist the sun shines through, she floated
by his side. 'Hail, earth-companion on the dusty way; yea,
together we will quaff the ether of the New Jerusalem;
and while we glorify our good and loving Spirit-Father,
shining so gloriously, yet mildly from his Son, and become
one with them and this bright universe, and glitter in
star and reflect in moon and milky-way, and sing in the
music of the spheres, and paint with the never-setting sun,
now glowing with hues which earth but faintly dreamed of,
and poetize in measures which ever flow 'fast by the throne
of God,' whose inspiration lifts us to his own communion
not yet conceived of, we will, in trustful harmony, pursue
our way with backward, grateful, but pensive glance it may
be, at every trial of earth which but prepared us to chant
without a discord the song, in which shall mingle no harsh,
unloving symphony. <i>Glory to God, forevermore!</i>' "</p>

<p>"I hope you will not idealize any more horses, or I shall
lose my usual pleasure on Sunday afternoon."</p>

<p>"Only let me see your favorite one and at least you will
not drive it at the rate of ten miles the hour again."</p>

<p>"But really I think you had better leave that out about
the 'Wandering Jew.' "</p>

<p>"Impossible! It would be slighting the good gifts of
Providence not to make the most of him, for he is the only
character I have with a touch of the strange and awful
about him. All the rest of you I know like a book, and
you are as harmless and matter-of-fact as lambs; but he,
with eyes a mile deep, and mystery, and it may-be, mischief
back of that, is in some way to help me to a plot;
for our friend, Mr. Headrich, and even my sober, truthful
husband says a story is not worth much without one. How
I am to work it up is not at all clear to me, but it must

<!--- vol 1 page 258 -->

come through this stranger if at all, so you may as well
ask me to stop writing altogether and close my brief life
of authorship, as to banish him from the premises. Who
knows but he was created on purpose to figure here? I
should be no better than an infidel to reject him."</p>

<p>"You are very willful, I see."</p>

<p>"Yes, you must let me have my own way for once, and
I shall live the longer for it, especially as I have been at
the world's beck all my life in a certain fashion, more than
I intend to be in future, I can tell you. So here I go at
my own sweet will, and if any of you are sailing in a nice
little skiff on some fine summer's day on waters which
you have no right to, why look out for breakers when you
see me ahead flying through the air on a broomstick."</p>

<p>"My gentle Lisbet!"</p>

<p>"O yes, gentle as old Boreas when let loose."</p>

<p>"My passive little sister can this be you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, passive as the sea in a storm, as the world in a
general earthquake, as the sky when a hurricane sweeps
over it; very, <i>very</i>, VERY passive, my penetrating brother!
But really, there is no need for fear; I will commit no deed
with pen and ink, which I am not willing you should repeat
towards me. Indeed, if you please, in your first Tale you
may have me for the only character, and show me in every
possible light, provided you only do it in the loving spirit I
do. So you see, I do not break the rule, '<i>to do as I would
be done by</i>.' "</p>

<p>"Are you going to Mrs. Sarran's to-night, dear Lisbet?"
said Mrs. K&ouml;rner.</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so."</p>

<p>"Look as pretty as you can, for it will be a beautiful
party in all its arrangements, I know; for hers always
are."</p>

<p>"I will wear my best apparel, but my pretty looks
depend very much upon other people. If you will tell the
company to please let me look pretty and they will consent

<!--- vol 1 page 259 -->

to, I shall be everlastingly obliged to you, for I have been
longing to have them allow my beauty to shine out ever
since I was born."</p>

<p>"What now, Mrs. Paradoxia?"</p>

<p>"Very plain and easy to understand. Such dull faces
as Zo&euml;'s and mine, must be lighted up by interesting conversation
to show well, and ten to one, there will not be
any up to my mark."</p>

<p>"You must make it agreeable yourself. I shall watch
you to see if you do your full part towards it."</p>

<p>"I shall try to as much as the prosaic times will allow
me. I can talk with interest for a few minutes and be enthusiastic
too upon the surface-subjects of the day&mdash;pickled
nuts, the last new fashion, novel, news, or author,
the prettiest belle, the different styles of matrons, magnificent,
or discreet and plain&mdash;eloquent, artistic, <i>new</i> or <i>coming
men</i>, war, pestilence or famine, but I tire of these transitional
subjects and want to go on to the real and substantial,
such as I indulge in in my day-dreams. Hey, Zo&euml;!"</p>

<p>"Give us a specimen, by way of variety, to-night, to
brighten up our circle a little."</p>

<p>"I have not the courage, when at the simple remark I
made to you the other day, that when grapes grew almost
spontaneously on the hillsides of more southern regions, it
was a sign that the people might eat them and drink their
juice, you laughed at me and called me fanciful."</p>

<p>"Never mind, talk as you like for all that. Drop the
weather and expatiate."</p>

<p>"I want no better subject than the weather, if I can talk
about it as I like."</p>

<p>"As how, for instance?"</p>

<p>"Well, supposing that Mr. Tubinger, who owns large
wheat fields, comes to me with benevolent intent to play
the agreeable, and after three repeated times informing
me that the summer is delightfully cool and verdant but
too rainy, adapting, as you see, his lordly mind to my capacity,

<!--- vol 1 page 260 -->

I should answer: 'Yes, the seasons in their round are
in close correspondence with our inner and outer life.
Our sins and follies disturb the order of the physical, no
less than the moral and spiritual universe. Creation groans
till now with the foul and foolish deeds of those who should
perfect the work begun by its great Architect. Tempest,
storm, and inundation, which sweep with devastating fury,
are but expressions of the want of harmony between man
and man, and both with nature. Subdue the hurricane and
whirlwind in the interior soul, enlighten it upon the great
forces, which at God's bidding rule the world as second
causes; let each inhabitant of earth perform his part well
in conquering its arid plains and deadly swamps to use and
beauty, and the world would smile as an Elysium, and Utopia
would be no baseless fabric of a dream.' Would he
not hem and ha, and think I was a lunatic? So, I say
quietly 'yes; but I think we shall have enough to eat and
drink.'</p>

<p>"Or, if I felt very cross, saucy and indignant, I should
add: 'Too rainy, is it? Is that an advertisement that your
crops are spoiled, and therefore, your prices will be heavy
for our staff of life? Shame, shame on you, when God,
with such abundance, pours from his garners food for the
millions of his children, that you should scramble to seize
an undue share by your monopolies, and make-believe a
dearth in the midst of groaning, bursting plenty! Ye shall
not have your selfish will. As there is justice and charity
above, ye shall be compelled to deal out your stores, in
meet obedience to true commercial laws. Gnash your
teeth&mdash;your avarice is impotent. Clench your hands&mdash;your
wickedness hath dealt its own death-blow, for in it,
as in a mirror, men will see how awful and unnatural it is
to pervert the free, unmerited gifts of Providence to their
own mean or selfish purposes, without thought or care for
the wants and miseries of others.' "</p>

<p>"Go on, I like it; hurra for Lisbet!" said Mr. K&ouml;rner.</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 261 -->

<p>"O, you are too satirical!" said Lina.</p>

<p>"Not at all. Again, supposing you, my brother, should
come to me, seeing me looking ennuy&eacute;e, and should say
brightly, 'What think of the times, little sister?' and exhilarated
as I always am by you, I should answer, 'Bright
visions beckon from over this dull waste of senseless folly,
crudity, narrowness of thought and temporary swoon or
captivity of all that is ennobling, beautiful and grand in
European life. For out of this sad wreck of all free
thought and frank and cordial brotherhood, from its atheism
and mockery of truth, and low morality, from its closed
artists' studios and authors' closets, double barred, and upturned
printing-presses, and shut pulpit doors, and darkened
courts of justice, shall come up a low indignant cry, which
shall increase, and swell and burst at length, until it rends
the welkin. It shall first rouse, like inarticulate thunder;
it shall resound over the nations, its spirit, lightening as it
goes, till these words, clear and commanding, shall, like
the trump of God, make the dead live, and raise them to
light and liberty. 'Citizen soldiers, standing armies, lay
down your weapons, reeking with the blood of those ye
have no quarrel with; disband your forces. Ye are the
Gods of Europe. Without ye, the despot's hands fall in
paralysis.' Let them see at last and tremble at the sight,
that bayonets not only think, but speak and act. And this,
their language is. 'Too long have ye wielded us for your
own selfish purposes, too long have we been your slaves to
do your hellish bidding. Wounded, bruised and maimed,
made like the ravenous dogs in temper, like the wild brutes
in soul, a spark still burns within us which shall flame up
and scorch ye for the ruin ye have wrought upon us. Fight
your own battles if ye will. If to the damned ye choose to
go with the blood of millions on your skirts, ye drag not
us beyond this very hour. We will not war against you in
fearful revolution; blood has been spilled in floods, and
still we are in chains. But we lay down our arms and

<!--- vol 1 page 262 -->

swear to fight no longer at your demoniac orders. Enough
to do in the short life allotted us, to live for God and our
own souls. Our children are born and live and die in
most unnatural severance from us, who gave them birth.
Wives, mothers, sisters weep till the eye loses its life and
stares sightless with the vain hope of greeting the son,
brother, husband of the sweet days long gone. For mutilated,
worn and hopeless, with the springs of life all
broken before our time, with misery and sin high heaped
upon our souls, the cursed inheritance of cruel tyrants,
we totter home to die, a desolated troop. O spirit brave,
gentle and tender, whose name befits the music tuned by
Heaven within thee, who wert sent by God to soothe the
spirits of the <i>under-world</i> on earth, the battle-field and
camp, bind up the wounds of those poor, fainting ones,
steep them with cordials that strength may last for them to
travel homewards, and weep out their homesick souls upon
the bosom of their own and die, blessing you with their
last breath! O beautiful type of womanhood, made
strong by a faith, whose watchword is 'God and Humanity!'</p>

<p>" 'Kossuth! sublime, yet humble Christian Statesman,
braver in self-restraint than in the deeds ye wrought for
thy 'dear Hungary;' now is the time ye have long bided
for. Take what belongs to thee, thou leading man of
Europe, for thou wilt rule only to bless, till the time come,
of which thy prophetic heart failed but in this, that it
yearned to share too soon for its country's good, the rule
with lesser spirits. Lead for a while with firm, yet generous
governance, the millions who look over to thee in thy
seclusion as their saviour. Marshal the forces, electrify
them with the spirit caught from him, who lived to bless,
and died to save mankind. Form Germany, Poland, Hungary,
many-sided, yet with one yearning heart, into a
Christian republic, each separate state an emporium for
art, or science, or learning, or morals, yet sending their
grateful tribute of life-blood to the centre, keeping it alive

<!--- vol 1 page 263 -->

with the true living ichor, fraternal love, then returning it
again in natural flow to every smallest member!</p>

<p>" 'Louis, thou modern man-sphinx, with thy face of stone
and supple frame, now starting into this form and now that,
to riddle the gaping nations! thou wilt yet glorify the land
which the man of destiny, Napoleon, loved with such fond
but doomed affection. Thou wilt yet reveal thy genius in
a way more startling than any yet suspected. Thou wilt
take off the chains from Artists, Philosophers, and Poets
among thy countrymen, whose spiritual insight, whose instincts,
beauty-loving, spirituelle, shall flower in noble
action, prompting to greater labors, more enduring renown
than awaits those deemed stronger, more worldly-wise,
and mighty through rigid formalism. These sons of genius
thou wilt bid God-speed in fashioning and adorning <i>la belle
France</i>, till, charming, she stands forth in beauty bright,
the <i>graceful Lady of our continent</i>. Then it will be
proved to those who taunted her with capricious vacillation
and weak subservience, that though it was not in her children
to combine successfully for victory and power upon a
<i>coarse idea</i>, she has but waited for her soul to grow beautiful,
ay mighty, too, to announce her resurrection in heavenly,
poetic, artistic, eloquent utterance, and rise and shine with
glorious and growing lustre!' "</p>

<p>"What an oration!" said Mr. K&ouml;rner. "Then that is
the way you would talk if you could, is it? Try it to-night.
I'll introduce you to the audience, and stand by you meantime."</p>

<p>"Of course I would not be so stupid as to be such a
nuisance in a party. Everything in its season, I say.
Conversation, light, graceful, tender, serious, airy, by turns
in the parlor, and orations and sermons in the lyceum and
church! When we women get the use of our tongues in
our legitimate sphere in the family circle, we will show
you how the thing ought to be done; but&mdash;"</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 264 -->

<p>"Indeed! everybody knows what chatterboxes you all
are. What now?"</p>

<p>"Men are everybody, are they? Did you ever hear a
woman say that her sex were the greatest talkers, making
speeches four hours long in parliament, preaching sermons
till they stretch to <i>twentiethly</i>, prosing hour after hour in
private, standing in the door-way lengthening out their
last words, <i>et cetera, et cetera!</i> I only ask you, or any of
your brethren, to note the five next assemblings of&mdash;say
three men and as many women in social converse, and see
which division talks the most, and how many times any
one of the ladies attempts to express herself and is not
overborne by the louder voices of the other sex. That is
all I want you to do. I am not anxious about the result.
However, I am not entirely serious in <i>this</i> complaint at
least. I believe that your sex ought to do the speaking in
public. Let women write. They wield a pen of various
power, and they can do it in the retirement they are fitted
for. And even in private, I think that gentlemen may well
form the <i>basis</i> of our conversation. Their substantial,
granite natures are fitted for foundation-work of every
kind. But if our thoughts, like vines and flowers, and
rainbows and dew, or even a good pelting shower now and
then, attended by thunder and lightning, which is very
purifying you know, seek to gild and beautify and refresh,
at intervals, do not say, 'pshaw, this is all flummery and
nonsense. Let us brush the stuff away,' and then tramp
on again with your heavy tread."</p>

<p>"Good. I'll agree to all this," said Mr. K&ouml;rner.</p>

<p>"But to return to oratory," said she; "I simply meant
that the spirit and subjects of our conversation should be
more earnest and elevated than they are. I verily believe
that many others as well as myself are revolving grave and
stirring questions within, who simply give out the scum
and froth of our best thoughts and feelings when we meet,
and for that reason society has become tedious."</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 265 -->

<p>"I fully agree with you; let me stay at home and play
with the children, I say. Yet if we would, through a
broad culture, bring out what is in us all, each his separate
gift, whatever it may be, society would be enlivening and
elevating; but to stand up for four mortal hours and play
and act the agreeable and interesting, with nothing inspiring
in the tone or spirit of the gathering, is getting too
much for my nerves, I confess," said Mr. K&ouml;rner.</p>

<p>"I have not got to that pass yet," said Mrs. K&ouml;rner. "I
look forward with a child's delight to this evening."</p>

<p>"I am so glad," said Lisbet. "And why should you
not, a sunbeam as you are, dance merrily here and there
among those who love and court you for your warmth and
brightness?"</p>

<p>"George Stephenson used to say, when his mother told
him to dress himself for her evening company: 'Confound
it, now we have got to stand and make faces at each other
till mother orders in the provender, when we shall smudge
round and eat apples in our prettiest way. Hilda, let's
cut and run.' "</p>

<p>"Rather free-spoken was the said young American, but
you seem to have a vivid recollection of him, my dear,"
said Mrs. K&ouml;rner.</p>

<p>"I have. I wish I could see him now. I wonder if he
is out in the western wilds of America, where he used to
say he was going," and even Hilda looked dreamy and
abstracted for a moment.</p>

<p>"But, sister mine, where did you learn so much, pray?
What college gave you the prize for being <i>orator primus?</i>
Tell me."</p>

<p>"Orator! did you say? I am no orator, only <i>men</i> are
orators of course, who puzzle their brains and get angry
if the children interrupt their awful lucubrations; who sit
up till after midnight scratching their heads and drinking
strong coffee, or brandy, gin, or what not; who smoke an
extra number of cigars, or may-be take an opium pill or

<!--- vol 1 page 266 -->

two by way of inspiration. And when the mountain has
brought forth a mouse, the procession forms, the best
carriage draws up to the door, the <i>orator of the day</i> steps
in, supported on either side by grave gentlemen in black
relieved by dazzling vests, and through crowds he mounts
the rostrum, rattles with cracked thunderbolts and lightens
with mouldy electricity in long-drawn, faded streaks, while
the initiated cry 'hear, hear!' When his eloquence has
expired of inanition, he is borne away on shouts to the
feast-table, where in deep potations he is drowned in the
praises of his compeers, which soothe his vailed, wine-composed
senses with the flattering unction of the <i>greatest
Orator of these progressive times!</i> No, no, I am no orator,
for I am only a woman and go about my daily work&mdash;now
make a pudding, now smooth a pillow, sweep my parlor,
prune my vines, and weed my flower-beds, or for recreation
sew&mdash;&mdash;and you know what; these thoughts and feelings
meantime swelling and rising until they flow out for
your and Lina's entertainment, and if for something better,
my beloved ones, so much the happier for me. But I am
no <i>orator;</i> that cannot be."</p>

<p>"What possesses you with the idea that Napoleon, the
Little, is going to work such wonders, and how do you
come by your spirit of prophecy? What is the secret of it,
pray?"</p>

<p>"You must wait and see if my predictions come true,
before you call me prophetic. How do I come by the
spirit? Think of a practical Anglo-Saxon asking me, a
dreamy Oriental, as I call myself, such a question! If you
had not an aurora of poetry in you which shines out now
and then, as when you tell the children their good-night
stories, for instance, I would not deign to inform you.
Why, man, I get it all through my <i>common sense</i>. Yes,
simply my common sense, which you all boast of so much,
but of which there is a disgraceful, diminishing, and disheartening
dearth in these dreary, drudging, dreadful

<!--- vol 1 page 267 -->

times among <i>your</i> sex, to say the least. Ours will have to
come to the rescue, I plainly see."</p>

<p>"But you have forgotten to answer my question."</p>

<p>"You should know yourself. Our Journals have exposed
the result of Louis' great intentions. Did you not
read yesterday's paper?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I saw nothing of this kind."</p>

<p>"Strange, when it was so prominent! You must not be
so busy with those law papers and then you would not fall
behind the times. Why, in one of them was this announcement:
'That the empress Eugenie's face was remarkable
for nothing so much as for its expression of a sense of
enjoyment,' which added to what I know of the emperor
through other sources, led me to this train of thought, and
I leave it to you if it is not very common-sensible.</p>

<p>" 'Now,' thought I, 'if Napoleon were as mean and wicked
as the world says, Eugenie's face would wear a different
look from that. There have been times since their marriage
when she seemed unhappy, and <i>they say</i>, that it
might be because her husband resolved in his mind
whether he had better not repeat the sacrifice of his uncle
in giving up Josephine. But Louis and Eugenie's was a
real love marriage, and great good always comes from such.
At any rate, all seems right between them now. Still, I do
not think it would be sufficient even for the happiness of
an empress, though I grant she is in a very false position and
one which is liable to make her very selfish, to throw over
her face the glow of a lively sense of enjoyment, simply to
have her husband love her if he were a very wicked man
at heart, or did not at least give strong symptoms of reforming.
No, Lisbet, you may depend upon it, she knows
a fact or two, and how to keep her husband's secrets too.
I have great faith also in <i>stone faces</i>, and that trustworthy
newsman, <i>they say</i>, says that his is one of the purest water.
Depend upon it, that underneath this dull surface something
great and good is revolving for her and the country

<!--- vol 1 page 268 -->

of her adoption. He has a strong will, a power of command,
and executive abilities, all requisite in its present
condition. Yes, he is just the man suited to succeed at
this distance of time, that great genius and reformer, the
first Napoleon. He will, guided by his example where it
was wise, warned by his mistakes, with a sage insight into
the spirit of the times and the requirements of the age,
strike the first hour upon the horologe which is to usher in
a new era of civilization, in which Art, Science, Literature,
and Religion are to supersede Hatred, Tyranny, War, and
Diplomacy in preserving the balance of power in Europe,
and allow the peculiar genius of either nation to attain its
natural development and growth.' All this I read in Eugenie's
face, revealed with a true woman's artlessness, and
you may be sure that she too will do her full part in bringing
about this new order of things.</p>

<p>"Now, do not say <i>absurd</i> to my mode of reasoning, but
wait five years and then pass your judgment upon it. I
see in Lina's face that she does not think I am an idiot."</p>

<p>"O Lisbet, day by day is it revealed to me, why, when
scarce beyond my infant years, as with fond care you led
me to our rustic day-school, I felt such pride in your protection,
and why, when the stranger met us on our homeward
way, I nestled close beside you, that be might know
I was <i>your</i> little sister. And now I greet you with glad and
grateful welcome in your new sphere of thought and duty,
sure that as with meek and patient spirit ye have gathered
treasures, too subtle for me, engrossed as I am, with my
maternal cares to grasp at, so will ye with true and graceful
feminine force express them in the great cause of raising
woman to her rights and duties. I only fear, that in your
zeal for truth, you may overstep the line beyond which the
world brooks not reproach and criticism. My loving heart
bids me to keep the chain of affection ever bright between
myself and others, and I do not compromise the truth, I
ween, in doing thus. And they must love you even as I am

<!--- vol 1 page 269 -->

loved, or half my happiness is missing. Keep in mind
your mutual relations with the friends at least around you,
and how painful will be a chasm between you wrought by
too free a pen."</p>

<p>"Lina, I thank you for your kind greeting, and no less
for the words of caution mingled with it. Think not that
with unguarded spirit, I dash the crudities of my careless
play-hours in the faces of my contemporaries. But with
affectionate, reverent spirit, as befits a child of the All-Perfect,
who, with wondrous skill made this our time-sphere,
and pronounced it good; so do I gather the productions
of my heart and brain, and weave them in simple
fashion, but with serious purpose, with traits and incidents
and expressions of my own and the little world about me,
with careful hand pruning my work of every falsehood to
Nature and God, hoping not to offend, but to give pleasure
to the passing hour. But by the fiat announced by Him,
who would have his children worthy of their high destiny,
to immolate ourselves, rather than to offend one of the
laws by which we are darkly held, I must reprove as well
as praise. O, my sister, ye have called to mind our childhood,
with your infant pride in me, and I have ever
deemed it as but a foolish fancy; though I loved you for
it. But I will be worthy of your early instinctive admiration,
nor mar with bitterness, the fair home of love, which
is the necessity of your being, but strive to have it fairer,
more worthy of you through my bold pen. For it is made
of a precious metal, the gift of friendship and relationship,
and dipped in the milk of human kindness, which cannot,
if it would, draw else than lines which run parallel with
truth and love, though in the process it may strive to sever
in all good faith, the ruinous excrescences from our lives,
and touch them with added healthful grace and loveliness."</p>

<p>"Then, dear, erase some of the most pointed remarks,
please do," said Mrs. K&ouml;rner.</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 270 -->

<p>"Lina, I <i>mind</i> the time, when sleeping on your baby-couch,
our mother and I would gaze in rapture on your unearthly
beauty, as your cheek lightly rested on the tiny
hand, the dark eyes closed in sweet repose, the lips divided
by a smile, the forehead with delicate veins coursing across
it, like rivulets repeating the upper sky-blue, and forehead
expanded heaven-like, telling tales of the angels who joyously
danced within. As with one breath, we would exclaim,
'how lovely!' I would question sadly, why, when I
closed my weary eyes to sleep, my brow would settle into
a frown of distress, and strange and fearful and unchildlike
dreams would lower from the darkness round me. Our
fates to me are now interpreted. You have fulfilled your
early promise. Affection, beauty, brightness and approbation
attend your every act, for each is overflowing with
sympathy and humanity. The suffering poor feed from
your open hand, which meantime softly heals the soreness
of their grieved natures. The sad and lonely cast but a
glance at your 'kind loving eyes,' and straightway lay their
burdens in your bosom. Birth, death, marriage, and burial
among those whom colder hearts would deem no claimants
are all familiar to you, who shed your sympathy like the
sweet dew from heaven, on all who ask it by look or word
or sign of grief, while, if it might be, you would gather
to your Eden a multitudinous household, and 'keep them
warm' with your embrace."</p>

<p>"Do not flatter me, I but consult my happiness," said
Mrs. K&ouml;rner.</p>

<p>"It is no flattery, but the simple truth, my Lina," said
her husband.</p>

<p>"I, on the other hand, like Memnon's statue, have stood
in stony silence, my music sounding deep within me, waiting
for the rising Sun's rays to strike my harp of thousand
strings, and chant anew the song of Bethlehem's
angels. Strange, that it should keep in tune so long amid
life's chills and damps and heats, and the coarse world's

<!--- vol 1 page 271 -->

rude handling; for my childhood mates have lived, acted,
uttered their oracles, and died, or have been absorbed in
the spirit of the times, making but slight individual mark,
by which to date their memories. Children have risen
since around me, and soon outgrown my dull intelligence
in Fashion, Elegance, Esprit du corps, Science, Art, and
Literature, Mental Acumen, and Skill of Leadership, each
one measuring the other by prominent development in one
of these or all, as is the custom. But I have simply lived
a <i>Soul</i>, growing by every influence Our Father sheds
around me, but chiefly by stretching my stature heavenward
to grasp his beams of light shed downwards. They have
guided me through no mean gymnasium which has trained
and strengthened me till now. But such culture befits not
one who would stand forth distinguished enough to influence
largely, or give a prestige so as to be heard with gentle deference,
though truth and beauty may drop like honey
from the lips. Such manners and such regard are given
to strong colors, red, yellow, or black and white mingled
in striking contrast. But I, a neutral tint, though striving
to mingle in the shade the elements of all the rest in fitting
harmony, have been too insignificant to reflect the rays of
any inferior luminary, shining by borrowed light. I have
waited for the Sun of righteousness to revolve near my
orbit with his full day of splendor, dawning near, to waken
me to give forth such music as he approves.</p>

<p>"I am his instrument, and if the chords may sometimes
rudely jangle, it is, that through temporary discord, they
may be attuned to the sublimest harmonies and charm and
elevate the listeners. I give you what is in me. Take it
in the spirit of love with which I yield it. It is the concentrated
essence of my life-song, ever sounding on through
all the weary years, but too much blended with the sounds
of Nature to be distinctly heard, except when some meek,
docile listener, with ear quickened by nightly chant of
spirits in his dreams, has placed his ear with loving trust

<!--- vol 1 page 272 -->

to my stone face and deemed the rising Sun's rays the sole
awakening cause of what he called unwonted strains, but
which I have ever striven to sing from every pore of my
stony-tinted being."</p>

<p>"Dear Lisbet, Memnon's music has never been turned
from with a deaf ear by me, though I knew not its varied
power of utterance. But to drop the figure, I simply
meant to express the idea that in a work designed for the
widest good, much tact and judgment must be used in its
construction, and in the handling of the different characters,
so as not to place you in antagonism with any of your
readers, or at least as few as possible. What you say about
your husband's parish, for instance, may offend more than
benefit."</p>

<p>"My dear, I write for people who are gifted with common
capacities, of course. One must at least, presume
upon thus much. I only ask for the judgment of patient
and sensible readers.</p>

<p>"The parish! I have been thinking that, like &AElig;sop, I
must take a candle at noonday to hunt it up, so gracefully
it was bowing itself away from our entreaties to build anew
our sanctuary; though when the pastor's services are
needed for its multiform requirements, it starts up obvious
enough. But, supposing that I should, in playful fashion,
place in opposite scales on one hand, the awful injuries
inflicted upon it by my pretty golden goosequill, and on the
other the wrongs of the sisterhood of ministers' wives. For
they grow uneasy upon the Procrustean bed on which they
are bound and cry out for freedom from their restraint. <i>I</i>
have no great complaint to make, for a neutral-tinted object
is seldom aimed at by the marksman, it is not sufficiently
evident to the eye, you know. Or, if some very sharp-eyed
hunter notes me and raises his bow, I pass on, saying,
'It cannot be for me, O no!' And even if the arrows
hit me, I am guarded by such proof-panoply within, that
they slide from me like rain from off a cabbage leaf. So it

<!--- vol 1 page 273 -->

is not for <i>myself</i> so much as <i>them</i>, I use the scales of
justice."</p>

<p>"Weigh on," said Mr. K&ouml;rner; "we'll see which side
kicks the beam."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>first item</i>. To be made the subject of a long debate
between wise men and sage elderly maidens, on our
matrimonial eve, upon whether 'we'll <i>do</i>' for the fearful
responsibilities of our future position. <i>Item second</i>. After
careful calculation upon how little salary will supply our
husband's slenderest needs, <i>to be thrown in as a make-weight</i>
in the scale which tips too lightly on his side to the
eye of careful bargainers. <i>Item third</i>. To have the same
wise men comment upon the undue attentions which the
pastor pays the bride during the honeymoon, thereby
neglecting them, their wives and children; and the said
elderly maidens throw up their eyes at the extravagance
of her wedding <i>trousseau</i>, and especially at that bright
bow or feather which she presumptuously sports in their face
and eyes. <i>Item fourth</i>. To be so unfortunate as to throw the
whole parish into convulsions if she steps to music a half
hour or two, though the wives and daughters may meantime
dance to early dawn; or into an incurable fever, because,
forsooth, she goes to see a drama enacted, though she
may meet the parishioners in a body at the play-house, on
the plea that she <i>sets a bad example!</i> <i>Item fifth</i>. To
have her first-born, and all that come after him, looked at
askance by the reckless youths of the community if he
happen to frolic extravagantly, when misled, it may be, by
them, with the sneering remark, 'pastors' sons are always
dissipated.' <i>Item sixth</i>. To be chief surveyor, engineer,
conductor, and engine-tender of the locomotive society, so
far as it devolves on women to keep it running, in order
that the <i>majority</i> of her sex who are more favored by fortune
may sit apart in indolent, elegant, fastidious leisure
and seclusion from the vulgar labors, social connections
and interests of the rude world at large, so detrimental by

<!--- vol 1 page 274 -->

its contact to the superficial gloss and tinsel of fashionable
and dilettante living. <i>Item seventh</i>. While at the same
time she denies herself a generous cultivation of her artistic
tastes and literary aspirations for want of time, engrossed
by her public and social duties and family cares, increased
by the necessity of earning, by some means, her own wardrobe,
denied by the meagreness of the living granted her
by the <i>parish</i>. Now look at the scales please, and tell
me which side tips."</p>

<p>"Stop," said Mrs. K&ouml;rner; "put first into them the
affection and its tokens which ever have attended you,
brightening your face with smiles while saying, 'how good
God is, shown in these symbols of their love, blossoming
thus beautifully in kindly deeds!' "</p>

<p>"Ay, Lina, not one is forgotten, but the spirit with
which they were proffered is cherished in my heart of
hearts. The children walk delighted through my dwelling
and say, 'How many pretty things our pastor's wife
has!' and I answer gladly, 'Gifts all of dear affection,
doubly valued for themselves and for their beautiful associations.'
The custom of the ancient Cyrus is repeated,
who, when the meat and bread upon his table was grateful
to his taste, said: 'Take the other half to yonder friend,
and say, Cyrus loves this, receive it from him.' And when
I walk abroad, proud of my brave attire, I say of some
ornament, 'this was the choice of friendship, it fits me
well.' "</p>

<p>"Then what would you have? You surely are not sordid,
though really your speech tends that way. Should
the sisterhood have a separate salary in addition to their
husband's, in consideration of their interest and aid in his
labors?"</p>

<p>"O no, no, no! we are too conventional and commercial
now in our modes of showing our interest in each other,
and it divides those who should be members, one in spirit,
as they are of one 'household of faith.' A cordial greeting,

<!--- vol 1 page 275 -->

a look saying 'God speed you on your way!' a flower,
a little mint, the slightest favor expressing our spiritual
relationship, would go far to unite those who fear to make
life a drudgery by too general a sympathy, and so look
askance lest the least greeting should draw down upon
them a host of social obligations such as the fashion of the
times exact. What I mean is this: that no woman should
be set apart, as too holy by her position to mingle in any
sports or recreations suited to her associates. It degrades
both her and them by a miserable superstition. Nor in the
work of life are they, more than she, exempted from the
responsibility, which each one owes as a Christian woman,
to do her full part to bring the world up to the tone of
God's requirements. Each one should be a priestess of
the Most High, and not only see that she burn no strange
fire upon the altar of her faith, but that the pure flame of
holy life shine brighter and brighter to the perfect day.
Then no unequal burden would heavily weigh on one, no
better fitted nor gifted with greater strength than others to
bear along the interests of humanity; but while she could
claim her share of leisure for beautiful culture and refreshing
recreation, many a one, now palsied in mind, heart,
and body by indolence and ennui, and an aimless life, will
waken as from the dead at the summons to the true life-work,
which now is resting upon a few wearied, and
anxious, and over-worked ones, starving their fancy and
living taste for beauty for want of leisure and pecuniary
means with which to indulge their cravings."</p>

<p>"You are very radical, Lisbet. The world will call you
a disorganizer," said Mr. K&ouml;rner.</p>

<p>"I am, and I care not what it calls me, provided some
words of mine may express the indefinite wish which many
have for a reform, and thus hasten on its progress. We
are souls and should have a soul's true existence, for no
one, however just, is unaffected by the atmosphere of
society around him, and I, for one, yearn for the companionship

<!--- vol 1 page 276 -->

which is shut out from me by overgrown conventionalism.
Sects, coteries, societies but divide us from
each other. Even those of the same household, who have
lived through every experience of mortal life together,
birth, death, marriage, heart-rending agony, sickness, sorrow,
and success, are ignorant as unborn babes of what
makes each other's life-pulse beat with highest hope or
sink in sad disheartenment. I say farewell forever to paltry
self-seeking, exacting friendships such as these; <i>Mene,
Mene, Tekel, Upharsin</i> is written against them on my heart
of hearts, dooming them to banishment and eternal condemnation.
They rob us of half our life; for a soul
shut up within itself, denied full expression of what it
lives, and moves, and has its being for, is but half living.
And how can Psyche spread her wings and soar to the
empyrean with no elastic atmosphere to buoy her up and
answer, breath for breath, to the timid fluttering of her
gauzy wings? Psyche! strange work must be thine own
in this enlightened age of <i>intellect</i>, but darkened and misled
concerning thee and thy just claims! Fold thy delicate
pinions and take the pickaxe, spade, and auger, and bore
deep, deep down to the crystal fount of human nature;
free the pure stream of truth which surely flows beneath
all upper incrustation, however dense, discouraging and
dubious it may seem to the weak in faith. Tire not, but
work in love, in season and out of season, by night and by
day, alone or with the cold, indifferent, or sneering world
gathered around thee to witness thy defeat. God, through
his Son who bade thee to the work, looks on and cheers
thee. Patience a little longer, and the living waters,
buried for ages, shall, freed from their dark imprisonment,
mount up high and still higher to greet the upper sunlight,
and then descend in purifying showers, cleansing the
atmosphere of all impurities, and leaving it healthful and
inspiring. Meantime, it plays in fountains, flows on in
rivers, falls in cataracts, collects in reservoirs, and is spread

<!--- vol 1 page 277 -->

from thence through every household, clearing, purifying
and gladdening all by its life and lustrous virtues. Psyche!
then spread thy wings, refreshed by rest, strengthened by
labor of thy more corporeal members, and fly into the clear
transparent blue. Now shall men see thee as thou art, the
symbol, expressive of what their life should be, strong,
vigorous, manly for thy earth-labors, but with wings fitly
plumed for highest soarings&mdash;heaven and earth in closest
junction, as befits children of time, but heirs of heaven."</p>

<p>"Lisbet, destroy not unless you re-create a new and
better friendship than you condemn. How can we live, how
can society exist without connections, rude they may be,
yet necessary to existence and efficient action here below?
Tell me the remedy for our social ills; show me the substitute
for what you banish."</p>

<p>"The Church! my Lina, formed of all living souls, each
one alive to the priceless worth of his own nature and its
development, burning with zeal to live like our great
Leader, our elder brother, God's most obedient Son,
nature's sole true interpreter, and to be one with him and
God! The Church! beginning with the household, going
out to our little company of fellow-worshipers, and spreading
and spreading till it becomes a Christian commonwealth,
embracing all people, tongues, and nations."</p>

<p>"A grand idea worthy of your husband! You have been
his docile pupil," said Mrs. K&ouml;rner.</p>

<p>"I have; but do not think it caught by rote from him.
My soul is quickened, a-blaze with this great sentiment.
O Lina! join this great communion; come to his feast.
Spurn from your generous and child-like soul the coarse,
metallic spirit of the age, if but its shadow has crossed it,
which sees in these simple symbols nothing but elements
of material bread and wine. They come to us from that
dark hour when he, the brother of our purest heart of
hearts, was in life's dire extremity. They whisper to us
in tones sadder and softer than any voice can utter, to

<!--- vol 1 page 278 -->

remember him who died that we might live. They summon
us to awaken from our lethargy and sins, and be
renewed in spirit and glorified in life; to commune
through them with the great and good of all past, present,
and coming time, with Jesus, as master of the feast, who
blends in his great spirit the genius of all that is true and
pure in the religions of the ages with the poetry of nature,
to form the subtle essence of his own eternal Christianity."</p>

<p>"We come."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, we come."</p>

<p>"O! let us join you also, in our youth," said Zo&euml; and
Hilda.</p>

<p>"And I too," said the child. "Do you love me, my
aunty?</p>

<p>"Yes, darlings, each and every one. The sweetest
flowers shall be glad offerings to our Lord, no less than the
ripened fruit. Come one, come all!"</p>

<p>"Now we will leave you better, I trust, and happier for
our meeting. Adieu, my sister!" said Mr. K&ouml;rner.</p>

<p>"Till we meet again this evening, adieu, dear Lisbet!"
said Lina.</p>

<p>"O this evening! Yes, I think I'll go. I feel at home
at Mr. Sarran's; his benevolent face, beaming a benison
upon his guests, is even better than if his speech were
freer without it, and the kind, gentle greeting of the hostess
reminds me of our mother. But wear that full gray
robe of yours, my Lina, please, that if I fail of courage in
a large company&mdash;for my heart sinks in entering a crowd&mdash;I
may hide my head between its folds, and, like the silly
fowl, imagine myself not seen. Or, now I think of it, our
hostess wears neutral tints, and I'll stand close by her, or,
if she is called away, I can hide myself behind the busts
and statuettes, or, if <i>they</i> are engrossed, I'll retire into the
library and put my face close to the portrait of my early
friend, and may-be they will think I am simply a shade of
that, for when we were young, it was said we looked alike.

<!--- vol 1 page 279 -->

Or better still, I'll sit upon the sofa with Miss Farrel; her
face is almost as stony as mine, ay, and covers as much
too, which will shine out some day to the amazement of the
superficial. We'll chat, and the guests will say: 'Are there
two there? No, yes, no; on the whole, there is but one.
How prettily she crochets!' "</p>

<p>"Lisbet, darling, let me say one word, and deem me
not intrusive. Your serious words have sunk deep into
my heart; your light ones jar upon my spirit, following in
such quick succession."</p>

<p>"Why, Lina? Dive deep into your soul and note in
your most natural hours, if various tones sweep not, one
after another, over its harp-strings. If pure and loving in
their spirit, they make no discord, but form a richer, more
thrilling melody. Look abroad on nature. Now it rains
gently, making sweet symphonies; now pours in torrents,
lightening for stage lamps and thundering for the chorus
of the orchestra. Momently, the sun breaks from behind
a cloud, like the great Primus Don, to dazzle us with the
splendor of his acting. Do these changes in the heaven-theatre
seem rude, unfeeling, and untimely? O let me be
free, at least with you, my sister! I am too grave and sermonizing
to suit <i>my</i> taste and fancy. My spirit is like a
rainbow, many-tinted. Would that the atmosphere would
reflect half its brightness! I live in the hope it some day
will. But even now shadows are flitting across my vision,
many-eyed and quick to <i>sense</i> the future. Heaven grant
they may not darken around us! Adieu, adieu! Pray
heaven for strength and guidance!"</p>

<p>ZO&Euml;'S eighteenth birthday had just passed, and she
was beginning to look forward to rejoining her parents,
from whom she had so long been exiled. A ship was soon
to sail for Santa Cruz, and the question was debated by
them whether she should return in it or wait for six months
longer, when another opportunity would offer for her passage
to the island. For a reason which will hereafter
appear, they decided that, notwithstanding their yearning
desire to see her again, which, on the part of her mother,
had become almost a mania, it still was better that she
should remain in Denmark for the present. In this Zo&euml;
more willingly acquiesced than she would have done before
her intimacy with Mrs. Liebenhoff commenced. In her
she found much relief from the devourings of her own
nature, turned in upon itself for lack of proper sympathy
and a nutriment congenial to it, and in that lady's high-toned
and enthusiastic character and sentiments, accompanied,
as they were, by a warm and growing attachment
to herself, she found an approach to the ideal friendship
of her day-dreams. On the one hand, the intimacy between
them was beneficial to her. On the other, considering
that her imagination was already unduly developed,

<!--- vol 1 page 281 -->

and her aspirations and religious sentiments in advance of
the character possible to an inexperienced young girl,
whose world had been as yet only within herself and her
school-room, and whose principles were not matured and
strengthened by practical life, the soarings of her friend
into the ideal and imaginative, as was her custom, acted
unfavorably upon her. These were but the flowering of
Mrs. Liebenhoff's nature on the summit of an experience,
which had strengthened her to the degree that there was
no exhaustion resulting from the act; the fruitage of a life
so matured by faithful labor, watchfulness, and a culture
suited to the soil of her mind, that it poured forth its abundant
harvest spontaneously, without danger of injury. If
the present influence upon Zo&euml; were considered, she
might be said to have erred in her intercourse with her,
though in a way very natural. Never before had she found
one so much like herself in her original constitution, and
at the same time, with equal simplicity and unworldliness
of character. Wearied as she was with many of the conventionalisms
of society, baulked of a full expression of
her aspirations and feelings by the different way of looking
upon life and the future of most of her friends and
associates, when with Zo&euml;, childlike yet mature, imaginative
and highly refined, and with a true eye for the beautiful
in literature and art, yet fashioned, as she was, very
much by the Hebrew Scriptures, and after the model of
the ideal presented by them, she felt such delight in her
companionship, that her whole nature gushed forth like
the crystal stream from the fountain, delighting and elevating,
but, at the same time, dazzling and unduly exciting
her. To be sure, she gave her the wisest counsel, suited
to her years and her peculiarities; but these were to bear
fruit in her pupil-friend afterwards, while the intoxication
of her fellowship was working daily in this impassioned
child of the Tropics.</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 282 -->

<p>"O Hilda!" said she, as she walked homewards, "I feel
as if Mrs. Liebenhoff were inspired whenever I am in her
presence. Even when I am sitting in silence with her,
when she is writing or sewing, or whatever she may be
doing, I am raised above my common life. Do you not
think there are some persons who shed virtue from them
as our Saviour did, without their voluntary will, simply
because they are so good and pure? I know I feel very
differently when with her from what I ever do with Miss
Ingemann."</p>

<p>"Miss Ingemann is good and pure, too," said Hilda.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it; but compared with Mrs. Liebenhoff,
she is worldly and common-place. They seem to me as
unlike in character as this Madonna, on my breastpin, is from
that portrait hanging up in the hall with a crape cushion on
her head and stiff stays on."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Liebenhoff is <i>too little</i> conventional to suit my
taste. I think she carries her ideas of fraternity and sisterhood
too far. She would make people all alike, it seems
to me. We should have no kings and queens, nor even
noblemen and ladies, with common people and servants to
work for and wait upon them; and I should not like that.
I am for preserving my dignity and not suffering every
menial and low-bred person to encroach upon me. I must
say I like to use my power over those beneath me, and
order them round a little. It makes me feel respectable;"
and Hilda raised her head and made herself as tall as
possible.</p>

<p>"I have never seen any one, not even Miss Ingemann,
who had such control over other minds as she has, and I do
not think it would be possible for one to treat her with disrespect,"
said Zo&euml;. "Her power is within, and her rule,
one which a proper self-respect, joined with love and sympathy
for every human being, gives her. O Hilda, in the
millennium, which I cannot but think is near, I believe

<!--- vol 1 page 283 -->

that God will be the only King, and Jesus the great Leader
of the world, with a more beautiful dominion than any there
are now on the earth. <i>I</i> want no other."</p>

<p>"Then, if you were presented at Court, you would treat
our King and Queen just like other people, would you?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, that would be very absurd and wrong.
God permits them at present to rule over us, and with a
pretty mild sway, compared with that of other wretched countries
in Europe. I should get instructions from some one
who had been there before me of how I must behave with
propriety, and I should not hesitate to say, 'your majesty,'
as is the custom; and I think it a very pretty title for one
who tries to deserve it as our good Queen does. But if I
thought, that in her heart of hearts, she did not see, that
by virtue of being a child of the Most High, and one who
tries above all things, to serve him truly, I were as good as
she, I should call her no lady."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Well these are new fashions of yours and
Mrs. Liebenhoff's. I suppose you would like a republic,
such as they have in America."</p>

<p>"I certainly should, only a better one, for Mrs. Liebenhoff
says they retain still in that, a good many false, feudal
notions in their government and social life. I want a real
Christian Republic, such as Jesus would establish, were
he to come on the earth, in which every one would be free
to develop their natures according to their own and God's
laws, government only serving to protect them in this great
work, and placing as many facilities in the way of it as
possible, and in which all the people would, in reality, feel
that they were equal in the eye of God and adapt their
manners and customs to the idea. You see that my year's
intimacy with Mrs. Liebenhoff has not been lost upon me."</p>

<p>"No, I see," said Hilda, thinking at the same time,
that although Zo&euml; had been happier and less irritable in
her feelings than before she knew her, yet, that she was
even more given to abstraction and more positive than ever

<!--- vol 1 page 284 -->

in clinging to what seemed to her extravagant fancies and
opinions than formerly. At any rate, there was less and
less sympathy if possible, between her and Miss Ingemann,
and this and the evils resulting from it were the greatest
trials of her own sunshiny life.</p>

<p>As has been said, Zo&euml;'s sentiments and imagination were
in advance of her years; her physique reached its maturity
at a later period than usual. While Hilda, at her age,
had the development, character and bearing of a young
lady, at least twenty-one, though mingled with great naivet&eacute;
and vivacity; Zo&euml;, on the contrary, at eighteen, wore
still the appearance of a young girl just budding into womanhood.
She was of medium height, of slender and
symmetrical figure, graceful, but languid in her movements,
with a face which seldom varied its expression from one of
almost stolid repose, when with those uncongenial to her,
or a pensive look of appeal and eager questioning, when
with those she loved and trusted in. Her complexion was
that of a clear brunette, her features regular, her eye
being dark, soft and mournful, her nose delicate in its formation,
though widening at the nostrils sufficient to give it
character, and the lips just full enough to enrich and humanize
a face, otherwise so ethereal in its beauty, as to
mingle the pleasure with which she was regarded with the
painful thought, that she would not be long for this world.
Her hair was very dark and shining, and wearing it as she
did, parted in front, confined by a band, with a rich mass
of curls on the back part of her head, when she appeared
abroad, she was always noticeable, no less for her beauty
than for its foreign characteristics, which distinguished her
from all her companions.</p>

<p>"How beautiful Zo&euml; Carlan, your West-Indian pupil, has
grown!" said a lady-visitor one day to Miss Ingemann. "I
had no idea that she would develop so prettily."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Miss Ingemann, "but her face sadly lacks
character, and for that it has ceased to interest me. It is

<!--- vol 1 page 285 -->

but a transcript of her mind, which I have decided will
always remain weak and childlike. I never shall be able to
develop it beyond a certain point, and that a low one. She
does not try me as much as formerly, because I see plainly
her incapacity for high culture, and I resign myself now to
her returning home with but a smattering of the branches
taught her."</p>

<p>"Ah! I had the idea that she was very bright. Mr. Liebenhoff
told me yesterday, that she had a rare nature."</p>

<p>"His wife has brought him over to her faith, I suppose.
The two are very intimate," and she laughed. "A fitting
companion enough for her she is too. I wish our Pastor
had a partner who could support herself better in a position
which calls for much strength and dignity of character.
Were she really <i>superior</i> she might give such a high tone
to our social circle. By way of complaisance, we have to
place her in responsible stations when we meet for various
purposes; but really, there are so many others better fitted
for them, and who really do from necessity take the lead,
that it seems a mere compliment."</p>

<p>"This, at least, can be said of her," rejoined her friend,
"that she claims no skill in leadership, and on the whole, we
get along more peaceably than if she were always <i>queening</i>
it over us. I sometimes think it is a principle with her to
keep in the background, as she does, that others may take
the parts they are well fitted for. You know she is pretty
radical upon the subject of all government."</p>

<p>"I know but little of her opinions excepting that I consider
her moon-struck generally, and for that reason, I
have dreaded her influence over Zo&euml;, who has no balance
of mind and character. All that I can do under the circumstances,
however, is to counteract it as far as possible
through her school lessons. I endeavor to do my duty by
her."</p>

<p>So there was no relaxation for her pupil in her daily
studies, but her powers were unnaturally taxed for many

<!--- vol 1 page 286 -->

hours each day in acquiring an insight into dry metaphysics,
or still dryer mathematics, so that at the most critical
period of a young girl's life, on which depends very much
her future fitness or otherwise, for its duties and enjoyments,
her brain and nervous system were taxed to the
utmost, without their being supplied with that strength and
nutriment necessary to their well-being by air, exercise,
and proper attention to general physiological laws. Added
to this, Zo&euml; was homesick from morbidly dwelling upon her
mother and the love with which she would cherish her, and
which was denied in a boarding-school, where, if she had
been ever so attractive to her teacher, she could share her
favor only with forty others. She was heartsick from
knowing that, do what she would in accordance with her
natural genius, she never suited one, whose methods of
culture were so rigid as Miss Ingemann's, and whose views
of human nature were graduated by the standard of judgment,
most favored in this practical and intellectual age, by
the narrow, keen, coarse, one-sided Anglo-Saxon mind.
Added to these unfavorable circumstances were her premature
religious sensibilities. Had she been under the
modern American <i>evangelical</i> influence, so called, where
there is a regular system in vogue of blowing up the tender
souls of the young into a flame of excitement before
the character is fitted to sustain, or the religious knowledge
sufficient to guide, or the wisdom ripe enough to protect
and train it in its great life-work, she would either have become
a maniac or a blas&eacute; religionist, or, perhaps, as many
do, have gone to the other extreme in animalism or infidelity.
But, fortunately, she was subjected to no such
forcing process in this respect. Miss Ingemann was a conscientious,
sensible woman, who believed that as soon as
she had a religious conviction it was to be carried out in
practice. She instructed her pupils in our Christian faith,
as she understood it. She was a Lutheran; but dogmatics
are not carried to the extreme, in Europe, that they are in

<!--- vol 1 page 287 -->

America, so that their minds were much less overlaid
than they would have been there with articles of human
creeds. They were taught Christian morals and piety&mdash;in
a modified form, it is true&mdash;still with less admixture of
error than would have been possible in such hotbeds of
Calvinism. Then Mr. Liebenhoff was of a wise, enlightened,
and deeply Christian spirit; and his pulpit instructions
were adapted to the guidance of souls, who have
a great and good life-work to accomplish, leaving but little
time to sharpen the wits to unnatural shrewdness by
polemics. At home and at school, the Bible was pointed
to as the chart by which they were to guide their steps,
and train their spirits, both through time and eternity.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to show Zo&euml;'s appreciation of this
volume, and the part it had in her training. Her mother
had given her one when she left her, saying, at the same
time, "Read this, Zo&euml;, every day, and not only God and
Jesus will be with you when you do so, but your own loving
mamma, too; for by the light of the holy Word I shall see
that my darling is under their kind care, and that when they
will it, I shall fold you to my arms again." For years she
had a superstitious, it may be, but none the less strong
feeling, that when she sat down to peruse its pages her
mother was near her, though unseen, guiding her in the
selection for the day, and impressing upon her childish
mind a reverence and love for its truths. So that her
filial affections were constantly operating to form and
strengthen her religious ones, at the same time that her
absence from her threw a vail of romance, not only over
the image of her which was impressed indelibly upon her
mind, but also over the Scriptures with which that image
was indissolubly connected.</p>

<p>Human nature is the most delicate and precious creation
of God, and to develop and mature it worthily of its great
Author and its high destination, it must have no one-sided
or eccentric culture, though even that may be of a purifying

<!--- vol 1 page 288 -->

and elevating character. Zo&euml;'s undue absorption in religion
made her superstitious and fanatical. She suffered
from a want of confiding and affectionate intercourse with
a variety of minds, and a more practical knowledge of the
world and its concerns. Hence her feelings became unduly
concentrated upon herself. Both her instinctive and
acquired sympathy with the character of Jesus was, through
a want of guidance, becoming a dangerous idiosyncrasy.
She felt that there was a similarity in their early fortunes
and characters, and it followed that, gradually, she imagined
that their destinies were to be similar. And here there
was what seemed an inconsistency in her, though, at the
same time, it was a very natural one. From having so high
an idea as she had of what she ought to be, and what it was
intended she should be, she suffered intense self-reproach
for her own imperfections, and every accusation thrown
upon her would deeply depress her, not so much from a
sense of its injustice as from its seeming simply the meed
of her deserts. And yet, whenever made thus miserable
by reproach and a sense of being misunderstood, she would
rush all the more eagerly to devotional musings, and in
simple converse with the Christ, forget that she, a few
moments before, had thought herself unworthy of being
the least of his disciples. "Yes, glorious elder brother,"
she would say, "first-born of a new creation, how little do
men know and love thee as thou art. But God has seen fit
to reveal thy brightness to me&mdash;me, a poor little, simple,
lonely, unloved girl. Jesus grew up a carpenter, and his
friends knew not how great and good he was to be. Only
his mother thought about the promise of the Father and
kept the secret in her heart. I wonder if my mother knows
that her child is to live over his life again in some way not
yet revealed to her, but none the less surely will it be
repeated. O come the time. Father in heaven, when I
shall see clearly how I am to fully perform thy great and
holy will."</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 289 -->

<p>These were thoughts which she never breathed, even to
Mrs. Liebenhoff. Had she done so, she would have striven
to correct them. But, on the contrary, that lady's glowing
zeal for the improvement of society through the influence
of Christianity, as embodied in his Church, served to fan
her own sanguine hopes and aims to an intenser flame,
and swell her heart with still wilder hopes, connected with
her great mission. She would exclaim to herself, "Yes!
the Church of Christ shall bring on, ere long, the millennial
day, and I will be the leader to marshal in his second
coming upon the earth."</p>

<p>These imaginations were more and more shaping her
daily experience. They gave a point to all her reading,
and through them she interpreted nature and the incidents
of her life. Every change of the elements pointed to
something in her destiny, and the most trivial words
dropped by her associates were often big with meaning
and suggestion to her. Her etherealized spirit sat lightly,
in one sense, to the earth and its common interests and
fashions. On the other, not a leaf could fall of the early
autumn foliage, not an insect could flit across her sublimated
vision, not an event occur either in her own private
history, the social circle of which she was a member, or
in the great busy, self-seeking world, without her reading
in them the signs which were to usher in a new and glorious
era of awakened Christendom.</p>

<p>The soul is a great realm. To the common eye it may
seem shrouded in thickest film of sense and apathy, giving
no sign even of ordinary action. And yet the outer revolutions
of empires, the overthrow of thrones, and the construction
of fairer kingdoms, principalities, and republics,
upon their subverted bases, are simply the symbols and
tokens of its workings. O reverence the human soul!
thine own no less, nor yet more, than that intrusted to the
keeping of thy fellows, for it is the vicegerent of the Almighty
upon the earth, and woe, woe be unto it if it work

<!--- vol 1 page 290 -->

not with all good faith and with enlightened wisdom his
lawful bidding.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; was sitting one afternoon of a hot July day, in an
undress, upon a cushion, on the floor of her own apartment,
directly opposite the window, looking upwards at the
fleecy clouds, which, piled in changeful masses, floated
past, breathing in with luxurious delight the fast fleeting
breath of the short Danish summer. She was startled from
her reverie by a white dove flying in at the window. As
it came towards her, she almost involuntarily opened the
single loose robe which partially covered her person, and
it rushed eagerly into her bosom, where it remained with its
wings spread, fluttering with fear, looking up into her face
with an almost human expression of appeal for protection.</p>

<p>It was probably pursued by some bird of prey, and such
seemed the obvious reason to her of so unwonted a visit.
But she was accustomed to look below the surface of the
most trivial events to gather hints for her direction in life,
and, in this surprising one, she read with clearer vision than
had yet dawned upon her the nature of her life-mission.</p>

<p>Poor persecuted innocent, she cried, as she looked into
its pleading eyes. God sent thee unto me, for my stricken
heart, he knew, would yearn towards thee and protect thee
from all that would work thy ruin. But what other message
hath he sent by thee, thou carrier pigeon from His
great white throne? Ha, now I see the missive folded in
thy fluttering pinion, and this its language is:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Zo&euml;, life of my life, awaken, arise,<br/>

Clothe thee anew with zeal and devotion,<br/>

Put on God's armor and strive for the prize,<br/>

The world wots not of 'mid its noise and commotion.</p>

<p>O show it the way to the truth and the light,<br/>

As it shines in the face of thy Saviour divine,<br/>

O save it from sin and the perilous flight.<br/>

Which awaits it while buried in vice and in crime.</p>

</div>

<p>She closed the window, as after the first fright was over

<!--- vol 1 page 291 -->

it seemed inclined to make its exit by the way it came in,
but Zo&euml; received it as a special messenger from heaven,
and she had no idea of suffering it to depart without
gathering from it its full meed of blessing. She gave it
food and water, and called in Hilda and her other companions
that they might admire its pure beauty, though, as
usual, she was very careful not to speak to them of the
deep significance which she attached to its visit. The
next day the poor bird moped and seemed ill at ease,
though carried into the open air of the garden, and wooed
and petted with all the tender tones of endearment, which
suggested themselves to her. Another morning came, and,
cold and lifeless, it lay in the warm nest prepared for it by
its gentle mistress. She looked aghast at first at the sacrifice
made of it to improper diet and confined air, and, perhaps,
to some injury received on its way to her. To
Rinda's "I told you so," she made no answer, but stood
and questioned with herself: 'What am I to learn by this?'
and the answer came very readily to one so impassioned and
absorbed in one idea as she was. "It bids me hasten to
do my life-work, she said. The world is famishing, dying
for the pure truth of God, revealed by Christ. Let me,
even me, show it the way to the Father by the simple precepts
and parables of our Lord; for has he not said that
out of the mouths of the simple and tender he will perfect
his praise?"</p>

<p>Filled more and more by this idea of being intrusted
with a peculiar mission, nature, the incidents of her own
life, the world and its events, became, as it were, but the
running accompaniments, or, rather, the index pointing to
this great object, each and all qualifying her for it, encouraging,
guiding and sustaining her in its preparation,
while, at the same time, God the omnipotent charioteer of
the universe was reining it in to keep even pace with the
hours, which were to usher in her ministry.</p>

<p>On her return from Mrs. Liebenhoff's she found on her

<!--- vol 1 page 292 -->

writing-desk this subject, upon which she was to write her
theme for the coming week, which Miss Holberg, at the
direction of Miss Ingemann, had just placed there: "The
beauties and advantages of docility and obedience in the
young." Zo&euml; immediately took the hint conveyed by this
sentence, and it provoked her, for she had ever striven to
obey Miss Ingemann's instructions and rules, and when
she had failed, it was only where her nature and sense of
truth had drawn her irresistibly aside from them. She
had strong impulses and a quick irritable temper, wrapped
within a nature of true gentleness and refinement. These
sometimes got the mastery over her to an extent quite ludicrous
for one invested with credentials for so sublime a
mission as she imagined, and her subsequent shame and
remorse were, of course, proportioned to the height from
which she imagined herself to have fallen. But in this
instance when the blood mounted to her cheek and the
flash of anger gleamed from her eye, she called them only
the natural and just effects of a holy indignation, and she
sat down with her pen and dashed off these burning lines:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"Docility and obedience are the two handmaidens to lead along our
steps during our weak minority, in the path which our great Father
has marked out for his children, beginning with their birth and leading
on and on to the glories and sublimities of eternity after eternity.
But does any weak, blind time-tyrant think to fetter the immortal
child of the ages, the <i>soul</i> of the souls of lesser spirits, dwelling in
darkness on this earth-sphere, within its own narrow intellectual
dimensions? No, no, for like the mist which the rising sun looses
from the mountain's brow, like musical sounds freed from the heavy-toned
organ at its swell and fall in the lonely midnight, like the
poet's measures sung to the winds in moments of rapt inspiration on
the solitary sea beach, so is the soul, enfranchised by obedience to its
own great laws and the word of its Maker, and shame, contempt,
and woe shall be the doom of him who seeks to chain it any more
than them. I come the time when freedom's breath and religion's
inspiring, directing wand shall be its only mistresses, clarified and
sublimed, as it will be by the millennial light. So yearns and agonizes
for this great spiritual truth the liberty-loving spirit of</p>

<p>"ZO&Euml; CARLAN."</p>

</div>

<!--- vol 1 page 293 -->

<p>She folded the paper upon which she had hurriedly
written these sentences, and placed them in the usual repository
for the pupils' themes, from which they were taken
by the teachers for correction.</p>

<p>It will be seen by this style of her composition, that she
had been strongly influenced by her interview with Mrs.
Liebenhoff, for, though her habitual thoughts were in harmony
with hers so far as their different ages would allow,
with the exception of her own personal idiosyncrasy, yet
her usual method of expression was more subdued, excepting
when very much excited, and then she expressed
herself in poetical strains, but limited more or less by the
bounds of metrical verse. To the narrow and superficial
this quality of imitation, which showed itself also in her
religious development, may seem a servile and inferior
one. Taking, as she did, the Saviour for her model not
only in the spirit of his teachings, but too much, as it
would seem, according to the letter also, since it led her
into the extravagant notion of her own future Messiahship,
she would be judged by the so-called philosophers of the
present speculative and inventive age as wanting in the
higher characteristics of genius and intellectual endowments.
But when it is considered that the universe is a
great school of all the sublimest arts, sciences, literatures,
and philosophies, with God for the great central inspiring
Spirit, who opens one arcana after another of its mysteries
as his children, by their obedience to his generous and
wholesome rules, are prepared for them, and that Jesus is
the pure, true, sublime, and loving revelator of the just
and right principles by which these mysteries are to be
interpreted, appropriated, and made practical to our daily
life, it follows that the most docile pupil and obedient follower
of these laws and of their great Archetype is in the
true path which leads to the inner temple, where shines
evermore the celestial light, revealing the cherubim which
keep their perpetual guard over the Holy of Holies. Like

<!--- vol 1 page 294 -->

the student artist who wanders from one hillside to another,
sketching, as it would seem, with slavish exactness each
rock, tree, mountain top, and rivulet within the scope of
his vision, spurning all aid from his own imagination or the
suggestions of another, so tender and reverential is his
love for each time-worn feature and furrow of the dear old
mother Nature, and deems that his likeness is befitting and
true, until he holds it up to her mirror with affectionate
longing for her smile of approval, and her wave of "God
speed you," when lo! disappointment. For the, but now,
haggard and ancient dame Nature, so hoary and wrinkled,
has doffed her garments of gray and her visage of eld, and
shines out lovely and fresh as a bride on the eve when new
life has been breathed through her being from the perennial
Eden of love. He dashes his picture, the pride of his
heart and the hope of his future, in rage and tears at her feet
"O mother, capricious and cruel!" he cries, "why have ye
deceived me?" But hark! hear her gentle and musical
voice, which now elates him with joy and enhances his love
to the pitch of devotion to Him, her great Author; for
before his couched vision, <i>His</i> glory now shines in each
line of her youthful and radiant face. And these are her
words, "O Son of my love, who, still groping and blind,
didst see too minutely each fissure and stain, each decay
and excrescence, yet loved me no less, ay, even more for
these weather-marked lines, indented by caring and laboring
for thee, receive now the reward of your trust and
affection."</p>

<p>She touches his eyelids and there thrills through his
being, a divine inspiration, and now is revealed the great
truth that he, who in reverent faith follows, step by step,
the leadings of nature and God through his Christ, in his
feeble minority, shall be one with them and the angels in
blissful communion; and his soul shall be trained, and his
hand shall be guided by a holy idealism, to paint for immortals
the <i>spirit</i> of earth and the <i>essence</i> of the heavens,

<!--- vol 1 page 295 -->

not on canvass alone, but on the ever during tablets
within.</p>

<p>Another influence besides Mrs. Liebenhoff's had been,
of late, assisting to mould Zo&euml; by its effect upon her imagination
and feelings. This was the acquaintance and
instruction of her German teacher. His method of tuition
was unlike any which she had been subjected to, and more
in accordance with the nature and character of her mind.
Discarding all tedious, elementary rules, he, at once,
through the aid of an interlined copy of the Gospel of
John placed that most beloved portion of Scriptures within
her grasp, through a form of expression novel and suggestive
to her. She made rapid progress, both in the pronunciation
and translation, so that when Miss Ingemann asked
him of his success with this, her most discouraging pupil,
she was surprised by his cordial encomiums upon her
mental capacity and docility of disposition. The thought
crossed her mind that she might have made a mistake in
her attempt to inclose Zo&euml; within her own cast-iron
methods, but like the oak tree, which, for a moment, may
sway to a powerful passing wind, only to return again to
its usual imperturbable sturdiness, so she soon regained
her usual self-complacency on this point.</p>

<p>But in other ways was the Hungarian shaping her
thoughts and sentiments more powerfully than through the
German language. He was a man of a strong, acute intellect,
trained both in the Jewish rabbinical schools and in
the cloister-like universities of Germany, filled with curious
and profound learning, both of the ancient and modern
schools of theology, philosophy and literature, at the same
time that his imagination was lofty and well controlled.
But what impressed her more than any other quality of his
character was his moral force. This was the commanding
element, which gave aim, energy, and perpetual vitality
and inspiration to his own life-work, and carried on his
pupils from day to day to unprecedented success in every

<!--- vol 1 page 296 -->

branch which he taught them. Like the waves of the sea
at spring-tide, which bear on their resistless current all
lighter substances, which, floating near, they draw within
their influence, so did his strong will, and high and never-flagging
sense of the great possibilities of the human
mind, when awakened to its duties, propel them with glad
but resistless impetus to high attainments. When a woman
feels this influence buoying her up and impelling her onwards,
she joyfully acknowledges the leadership of man.
Her clear, spiritual glance <i>sights</i> from afar, the true, the
beautiful, and right, and she plumes her butterfly wings
and flutters gladly towards it, but with feeble and unsteady
motion, unless his strong, eagle-eye and pinion, which
never blinks or tires, cleave the air and make a swell, so
that she be strengthened and sent onwards in her flight.
If he do this, his heaven-ordered part, she sparkles brightly
and more brightly as she nears the upper sunlight, playing
about his head, resting her grace and beauty upon his heart,
flying ever and anon in advance, sustained by his strong
breath, then nestling with joyful acknowledgment of weak
ness upon his kingly form, even making herself tinier than
need be that he may be glorified the more in the view of the
great skylight. O man! beware how ye come within the
sphere of any base, destroying elements, for, though ye may
escape utter ruin to your coarser immortal fabric, her more
ethereal and tender one may be irremediably bemired.
Keep her beside you in your highest soarings, and she
will preserve the curtain of your eye cleansed to the point
of clearest vision, and give you such glad impulse by her
cheering that the rarer ether will never weary, but change
more and more your earthly being to the celestial temper
of her own, only relieved by what she most looks up to
and admires, your strength and manhood. Zo&euml; <i>felt</i> this
force more than she <i>reasoned</i> upon it, and her progress
was in accordance with the conviction. So delightful was
it to be cordially praised for any acquisition, that, through

<!--- vol 1 page 297 -->

her study of German, her whole nature took a start, and
the school-girls, quick to perceive each other's inner or
outer changes, laughed at her for actually growing taller
under the new administration.</p>

<p>"Zo&euml;," said Adelgunda Heiliger, one day as she was
assisting her to dress, "you must get a new frock and
charge it to Ben Ezra. He is the cause of this sudden outgrowth
from the old one, and it is but right that he should
replace it, for really this is too scanty for you in the present
fashion."</p>

<p>"Let her piece it out to the proper length with her German
exercises," said Rinda. "They will answer for phylacteries
which, you know, she will have to don by-and-by,
as is the custom of certain people. Hey, Zo&euml;!"</p>

<p>"Of all things in this world, don't call our teacher a
Pharisee," said Zo&euml;, "for he is at the moral antipodes from
that sect."</p>

<p>"At any rate he intends, from present appearances, to be
no Essene," said Freya. "Zo&euml;, love, invite me to the
wedding, will you not, and introduce me to Ruth? I have
always wanted to know her better. I will help her glean,
next time she goes to the field of Boaz, and I will be as
little fascinating as possible too, so as not to damage her
prospects with her kinsman."</p>

<p>"Here are some nice smooth stones," said Adelgunda,
"which I picked up on the sea beach, which I shall drop
into David's pouch as I sit at the feast-table with him. I
am going to strike for the throne and cut out Michal altogether.
I never shall reprove him for dancing, but will
waltz till the ark drops to pieces from old age. I shall
have an opportunity to learn some new figures, shall I not?
and I will astonish Mr. Ernestine next time he comes to
give us our lesson."</p>

<p>"And I," said Hilda, "shall accept nobody's attentions
but the magnificent Solomon's, and won't I scatter the inmates
of his harem, and reign supreme over Israel, no less

<!--- vol 1 page 298 -->

than himself? The Queen of Sheba need not think to
come again and delude him by her flattering compliments.
I will give her the go-by in a way she never experienced
before. But we forget the principal personages of the occasion.
Zo&euml;, darling, what <i>r&ocirc;les</i> will suit you and Ben Ezra
best, besides that of bride, Madonna-like and saintly, and&mdash;what
shall I call him of all his metamorphoses?"</p>

<p>"Call him the Prophet-Priest and King Melchisedec
of the coming dispensation, who, without beginning of days
or end of years, remains forever the emblem of peace and
justice, on whom devolves the ministry divine of ushering
in the representative of the second coming of the Son of
God," said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"Ah! King of Salem! I salute thee and hail with joy
the day when thou, man of the ages, mysterious and
mighty, born without father or mother into our time-globe,
takest to thy arms of eld my Zo&euml; to give thee youthful life
again, and carry her on to her high destiny!" said Hilda,
bowing to her German class-book.</p>

<p>"When is this wonderful union to take place, Zo&euml;?"
said Rinda. "I like to know of great events in season so
as to be in proper readiness."</p>

<p>"Ask the great High Priest of heaven and earth, even
our heavenly Father," said she with great seriousness.
"There are secrets which even Jesus was not let into
when on earth, much less am I. But cease your mirth
and raillery, my friends, for I never expect to marry,"
and she walked out of the room absorbed in her own
thoughts.</p>

<p>This was a part of her idiosyncrasy, which strengthened
as she grew older, that, like Jesus, she should fulfill her
mission unbound by the strongest ties of life. To-be-sure,
she was shaken for a moment, now and then, when in the
presence of her teacher, whose increasing interest in her
became suspected by her companions. When his voice

<!--- vol 1 page 299 -->

sank to a tender tone as he addressed her in her recitation,
or she caught his eye resting upon her face when she
raised it in inquiry to his own, while following his reading,
she forgot for a moment her peculiar fate and felt a thrill
of youthful love's first dream, but it was soon forgotten in
her life-long musings.</p>

<p>WHEN Miss Ingemann read Zo&euml;'s outburst of feeling
in her theme, she was shocked and almost discouraged;
but being both strong and decided in character, and, at the
same time, conscientious and faithful, so far as she saw her
duty, she determined to make a strenuous effort to cure
her pupil of her extravagant fancies and willful opposition
to reasonable restraint. She sent for her to her
room. Zo&euml; knew what was coming, but she had got to the
point, at last, where a determined purpose and strong conviction
of being in the path marked out for her by God
and her nature will bring even the most plastic and gentle.
Therefore, with head unusually erect and eye expressing
courage and enthusiasm, she stood before her teacher.</p>

<p>"Miss Zo&euml;," said Miss Ingemann, "here is your theme.
Its expression does not come within the limits of propriety
and good sense, and therefore we cannot accept it from
you. We require you to re-write it in a mode consonant
to what you know is our reasonable expectation."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Miss Ingemann, I cannot do it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean. Miss Zo&euml;? That you intend a willful
disobedience to the rules of this establishment?"</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 301 -->

<p>"I have no such willful intention. I have simply written
my true feelings and thoughts, and I cannot falsify them
by a different expression."</p>

<p>"You amaze me by your presumption. I demand of
you a more subdued and rational composition. The
thoughts are extravagant and fanatical, and the expression
wild and highly improper, and we cannot permit such
within these walls. This is my unalterable determination,"
and Miss Ingemann arose and stood at her full height.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; was completely roused, and she burst forth like a
torrent to the astonishment of her teacher, who had never
seen her under such excitement.</p>

<p>"Madam, I have uttered what is in me, and woe be unto
my soul if I turn aside the inspiration of God into another
channel at the bidding of human lips! I read yesterday
in a journal from that far-off land which God opened, that
his children might have one abiding-place for freedom to
worship God according to His and nature's laws, that her
ministers, instead of being guides to lead and light along
the people to the millennial day, enchain their minds
each five years by a promise to utter nothing but what its
creeds of ages gone by have ordered. So they squeeze,
and trammel, and wind their thoughts like serpents, ever
striving to be free, around a time-worn, bloody, lying parchment.
Only now and then one frees himself, so as to interpret
the Word of God as He demands of the growing
powers he gave him. But hark! a hiss and sting, and the
poor timid spirit coils himself again in meek submission
to the dismal parchment, whispering, 'I said it not,' or, if
I did, 'I meant the same as you!' And what is the consequence?
Why, sins of every shape and hue start rampant
round them, emboldened by the falsehood and treachery of
the priests and prophets, scattering misery and darkness, and
hurling to perdition millions whom God has given into their
keeping. No, madam, even in my simple school-girl

<!--- vol 1 page 302 -->

theme, I will take warning of this fearful doom. I change
it not."</p>

<p>"What heroics are these?" said Miss Ingemann, indignant
and astonished; then paused to look critically into
Zo&euml;'s face to see if she were not insane. Her pupil knew
well that gaze, and it always turned her into stone. She
simply bowed and left the room.</p>

<p>Once out of her sight, she ran like lightning into her
apartment, where she found Hilda.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" said she, alarmed at seeing Zo&euml;'s
excited face.</p>

<p>"The matter is, that I am going to sail to-morrow for
Santa Cruz."</p>

<p>"Why, what has happened? tell me."</p>

<p>"Hilda, I have lived entrammeled long enough. My
chains gall me to the point of desperation. God and my
conscience command me hence, and I obey them. The
ship departs to-morrow, and I shall take passage in her."</p>

<p>"But, Zo&euml;, you cannot go alone. You never have been
away from this retreat, and think how you would feel upon
the deep or among uncongenial strangers!"</p>

<p>"Hilda, you know me not. I can do anything. I have
powers within me that can shake the nations, ay, and shall
do it too; how much more guide my own way across the
waters. In God I trust. He will watch over me."</p>

<p>"O Zo&euml;! I know you better than you think. I have
noted your genius and rapt, poetic soarings, so different
from the working of my mind, and I have striven to reveal
them to our teacher, but your own failure of response to
my encomiums by ever wearing before her your stony face,
has made them seem to her only like my childish preference
for you without a base of truth. I know too, that
your broad vision takes in the practical, as required within
our little circle, for we, your schoolmates, ever come to
you for a decision upon our little tastes and decorations.
But, darling, you are not strong as we are, and one day

<!--- vol 1 page 303 -->

your spirits rise to the mountain top in exultation, and the
next fall into the abyss below. Does she not aid and
soothe thee then, thy own strong Hilda, of this common,
naughty earth-sphere? Zo&euml;, how canst thou live without
me, or I without thee, if thou art far away?" and she
began to weep.</p>

<p>"Hilda! my own, my good and true, who hast borne
with such meek yet cheerful patience with my wayward
temper, and hast had ever a word and smile of gladness
for my strange woe, the cause of which I hardly know of,
though it pervades my being, checking each gladsome
thought ere it is fully formed, casting a shadow over each
smile ere it shines forth to brighten my dull face, thinkest
thou I love thee not? O my friend! though a strange gulf,
riven not by me but by our Maker, for I have vainly striven
all these years to cross it, to cover it up, or make believe
that it existed not, divides our deepest souls, yet are you
dear to me as my own life. When you are not by, I am
restless and forlorn, I gaze into the distance to catch the
first glimpse of your beloved form, and strain my ear for
quick intelligence of her who is my sunshine, my tower
of strength to lean upon, the interpreter of my thoughts to
the stern world, which chills them ere they are expressed
by its cold glitter and its icy breath. I know not how life
can be life without thee, but God points with direct, commanding
index towards the great ocean, and I go; for in him
I live, and move, and have my being in a way which seems
to me most peculiar, and if I disobey his counsel, not I
alone but the whole universe is jostled from its orbit. Of
this I must say no more; but, O Hilda! pray that I may
have strength and guidance for my strange destiny."</p>

<p>"Zo&euml;, my life, my inspiration, guide, restraint, and tenderest
friend! I go with thee. Whatever betide thee shall
be shared by me, so far as God permits. Thou shalt not
leave me to the desolation which would come over my lot
unshared by thee, my childhood's mate, the sharer of my

<!--- vol 1 page 304 -->

room by night and day, and to whom I have grown each
year by finer yet stronger ties, even to my opening womanhood,
when judgment, taste, fancy, and deeper religious
yearnings all point to thee as my best earthly satisfaction.
Can I relinquish thee for all the world beside! No, never!
we go together."</p>

<p>The two girls embraced each other with all the enthusiasm
suited to their different natures, united as they were
by a strong and disinterested affection, high principle, and
the purest sentiment. To Hilda there remained a painful
and difficult task, which was to inform Miss Ingemann of
her determination. They loved each other. With the one,
the affection was mingled with pride and a just satisfaction
at the successful result of most conscientious training;
with the other, gratitude and admiration for this oldest and
most faithful teacher and guide. But she hesitated not a
moment in view of this trial. "Zo&euml; needs me more than
any other one in the world, and how can I live without
her?" she said to herself, as with the quick decision and
courage which characterized her, she threaded her way to
Miss Ingemann's apartment. She found that she and Miss
Holberg had gone on a visit to a friend in the country, and
would not return until late in the evening. What was to
be done now? Zo&euml; was the directress in this emergency.</p>

<p>"I must go and bid Mrs. Liebenhoff farewell," said she.
"She has been so confined for the last week, nursing our
pastor in his severe sickness, that I have not met her for
several days; but I must see them both."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hilda, "and Mrs. K&ouml;rner and other friends
too, and above all, Mr. Andersen. Then the captain&mdash;we
must make arrangements with him immediately. O, how
much we have to do!"</p>

<p>"Here is your hat, Hilda," said Zo&euml;, as she put on her
own. "Come, we can tie them on the way."</p>

<p>And the twain, with gloves in hand, arranging their
mantles as they walked along the street in a way which

<!--- vol 1 page 305 -->

would have shocked their teacher's nice sense of propriety,
walked with rapid strides towards Captain Keiser's
dwelling.</p>

<p>As they came within view of the sea, they saw a ship
just sailing from port. They looked at each other and
said nothing, but quickened their pace almost to a run to
reach the captain's house. The servant at the door told
them that he had just sailed for the West Indies, and that
they had been misinformed in supposing that the next day
was the time of his leaving.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; looked bewildered for a moment, for guided, as she
felt herself to be, by a special inspiration, this obstacle
she could not account for. They were slowly retracing
their steps when an acquaintance of Miss Ingemann, an
elderly gentleman by the name of Sarran, whom Hilda, in
her fondness for playful titles, had dubbed "the Viking,"
from his frequent voyages, met them.</p>

<p>"Good evening, my Volkyria!" said he to her. "Why
droop your wings in that fashion? Come, give me a shake
of the hand, ay, and something better too, as a parting
blessing, for I suppose you know that I am off to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; for where?" said Zo&euml; and Hilda in one breath,
catching at the faintest hope of release.</p>

<p>"To Santa Cruz. Do you think I am going to winter
my old rheumatic frame among the ice and snows of old
Denmark? Not I. I hope I know what is best for myself.
Any commands? I am at the service of any fair damsels
of Valhalla, who may wish to send anything, mayhap in
the shape of a love-message to the other world, and keep
it a secret, too, from the powers at head-quarters," said
he, winking at them. "Neither Odin nor Freya get any
revelations from me. Hey, ladies!" and the good-natured
old gentleman laughed at his own bright wit, as it seemed
to him.</p>

<p>"May we go with you?" said Zo&euml;. "O, pray, let us!"</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 306 -->

<p>"<i>How</i> are you going?" said Hilda, "the ship has
sailed."</p>

<p>"By England. The monthly steamers to the West-Indies
are a better conveyance than any other, in these
days. Besides, I have business in London. You go with
me? Bless my stars! ain't I in luck? To-be-sure you may,
and you need not fear but that I will take good care of you
too. There is no gallantry in these days like what I was
bred to. But be sure and not be tardy, for I like to be in
season. At five o'clock, to-morrow evening, we must be
on board, bag and baggage. Remember the hour, please,"
and the old gentleman bustled away more self-important
than ever.</p>

<p>"It is just what I want," said Hilda. "Mamma has
always said that I might visit her relations in London,
before I left Europe, and now is my opportunity. But
here is the parsonage. I hope that Mr. Liebenhoff is not
very ill."</p>

<p>They ran up the steps and asked for their friend. Mrs.
Liebenhoff at first sent down her excuse, saying, that she
could not leave her husband; but on telling the servant
that their urgency was extreme, she appeared, but sad and
worn by night-watching and anxiety. They told her in
hurried terms, of their sudden determination, but forbore
to enter into particulars in her present state of feeling, and
she, though sad and tearful at the thought of losing them,
was not so much surprised as they expected. The fact
was, she knew that they were to go home in the course of
the year, and preoccupied as her mind was by her husband's
illness, it did not seem strange to her that they should be
summoned to return a few months earlier than they anticipated,
so she did not question them about it.</p>

<p>"Can we not see Mr. Liebenhoff, one moment?" said
Hilda.</p>

<p>"I think so. I will see," she said.</p>

<p>In a few moments they stood before him. He was

<!--- vol 1 page 307 -->

propped up by pillows, pale and emaciated, and they were
shocked to see the change which a few days of suffering
had produced in him.</p>

<p>"You are going to leave us then, and next Sabbath you
were to join us in our renewed communion? We shall
sadly miss our dear young friends. It may be, however,
that I shall be absent too; what think, dear Lisbet? Well,"
seeing her turn aside in agitation, "it must be as God
wills. Farewell, little ones! be good children and remember
us, as we shall you, with love and prayer, that God
may bless you and grant us to meet again!"</p>

<p>They kissed his pale forehead, then were folded for a
moment in the arms of Mrs. Liebenhoff, and weeping left
the house.</p>

<p>A few more calls, and tender adieux, and many tears,
and then they returned to gather their goods together
for their voyage. They sat up late packing their boxes,
writing farewell notes to friends whom they should not
see again, and arranging everything with a discretion
and sense of fitness remarkable in two young girls,
who had ever been watched over by careful guardianship.
But it seemed as if a great purpose had matured them in
a day and carried them to its fulfillment, as with the force
of inspiration. They talked over their plans till late at
night, then fell into fitful, dreamy sleep to awaken by the
broad sunlight shining into their window.</p>

<p>After breakfast, hand in hand they appeared before Miss
Ingemann. She looked up from her book and started, as
if she read a strong resolve in every feature of their faces.
Hilda, who thought she had nerved herself for the crisis,
began to cry.</p>

<p>"What means this?" said their teacher.</p>

<p>"We come," said Zo&euml;, "to inform you, madam, of our
determination to return to Santa Cruz. We are in readiness
and shall leave this evening. We ask your blessing
on our way."</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 308 -->

<p>Miss Ingemann looked from one to the other, doubting
the evidence of her senses, then with dignity and a slight
curl of the lip, said to Zo&euml;:</p>

<p>"And who has given you permission to leave your
guardians so abruptly?"</p>

<p>"God and my conscience," answered Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>Miss Ingemann had high respect for principle and a
strong resolve, and though she saw lamentable fanaticism
in her pupil, yet she could not but respect the determined
bearing of the young girl, though she meant that it should
yield to her own strength of will.</p>

<p>"Zo&euml;," she said, "I do not wish to be harsh with you;
but you are entirely in the wrong in this matter. People
are not inspired in these latter days. We have other aids
to guide us. It is very wrong for you to think of leaving
your school before your father sends expressly for you."</p>

<p>"My father had in view only my greater ease and pleasure
in bidding me stay a few more months. But I know
he is in trouble from the unsettled condition of our island
at this time, and I wish on that account, if on no other, to
return. I am not selfish, as I wish to prove to him.
Already he has spent beyond his lessened means in my education;
and my mother and I are pining to meet each other.
I wish to go. Mr. Sarran will protect us on the voyage."</p>

<p>Miss Ingemann's methodical mind was not convinced by
these reasons. There was always much formality in the
manner of the dismissal of her pupils, and this extemporaneous
leave did not consort at all with her strict notions.
She waved her hand and said, "It is of no use to exchange
words upon this subject. I dismiss you, young ladies, to
your studies."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; was roused and burst out again. "No, madam, it is
of no use, as you say, to lengthen words upon my leaving
you. A greater than my teacher bids me go hence,
where my every respiration is drawn at the expense of
truth, of nature, and the high behest of God.</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 309 -->

<p>"Last night in dreams I saw myself upon the broad and
fearful waste of waters. Strangely did they sustain my
weight, as with most natural self-possession, with drooping
head and hands suspended by my side I walked upon
them. There was darkness behind, and gloom and a fearful
wall of briny waves before me, but a bright gleam from
heaven, shining through a silvery cloud, lighted my footsteps
close before me, and the mists blew westward, and
the waves flowed fast towards the same goal; and the wind,
the sun, and every voice of nature sounded in my awakening
ear&mdash;'Onward, still onward,' and I <i>must</i> go."</p>

<p>Seeing the girl's determination, and knowing that, in a
few months, at farthest, she was to give her up, the thought
came to Miss Ingemann's mind, like a flash, that she had
better not contend longer with a nature with which she
had so little sympathy and success; and as she knew Mr.
Sarran well, and that she could confide her to him with
safety, she changed her tone and said: "Well, Zo&euml;, if you
choose to take the responsibility of disobeying your father,
I will no longer fetter you, as you, in your high-flown
language, accuse me. I will write to your parents, explaining
to them the reasons for permitting you to leave. I am
sorry if my care and labor for your good have only given
you the sense of bondage. I have striven to do right by
you," and her voice trembled.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; was completely subdued by this expression of feeling.
One of her accustomed revulsions came over her after
a time of excitement. She threw herself on her knees
before her teacher, wailing out, "Think me not ungrateful
for all the good I have derived from you. My heart is
burdened with a sense of unworthiness; for I well know I
have not met your plans and exertions in my education as
you have desired. Forgive me, and yet pity me, for I
know not what I am, nor what God would have of me. I
could not be what you wish, and yet I am weighed down
by remorse that I am not."</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 310 -->

<p>This unwonted revelation of her struggling feelings,
which was forced from her by the softening influences of
the occasion of parting from her home and teacher of
years, brought out strongly the opposite characteristics
of these two beings.</p>

<p>Zo&euml;, gentle, affectionate, and humble from ever looking
upwards to an exalted ideal; poetic, sensitive, and delicate
in her feelings and of quick insight into character, felt no
resentment at the obstinate efforts of Miss Ingemann to
warp her nature aside from its rectitude and beauty by a
culture unsuited to it. On the contrary, she looked at the
conscientious motives which had governed her in the main,
forgetting now what she had previously felt very forcibly,
that wounded pride was also a cause of her being no
better liked by her teacher. She simply wished to be free
as God and her own soul irresistibly impelled her, and,
therefore, the step she was taking, accompanied as it was
by so much heart-rending feeling.</p>

<p>In Miss Ingemann's character, on the contrary, pride,
self-reliance and self-esteem were combined with a strong,
clear, but narrow intellect, and a reason which took in but
little besides the obvious, striking, and practical in life and
character. To this was superadded a religion, which
though abstract, speculative, and mystical in its creed, and
favoring a certain cast-iron form of sentiment and contracted
mode of religious experience for all souls alike,
frowned upon all indications of an awakening religious
life in accordance with the advancing mind of the age, and
the natural influence of a more rational understanding of
the spirit of our faith in its gradual emancipation from a
slavish obedience to the bare letter of Scripture. The
consequence was that there was in her a hardness, directness,
sternness, and even scorn and intolerance towards
what was the deepest life and inspiration to Zo&euml;, her poetical
sentiment and rapt musings with the ethereal spirit of

<!--- vol 1 page 311 -->

nature and the universe, quite crushing to all her confidence
and trust.</p>

<p>These qualities were revealed in her answer to
Zo&euml;'s simple expression of gratitude and confession of
self-reproach.</p>

<p>"I am very glad, Miss Zo&euml;, that you show symptoms of
a proper consciousness of your faults, and that you are not
<i>entirely</i> unmindful of all that has been done for you.
However, I am very direct, as you know, (this she often
said with much emphasis,) and I must say to you that there
are reasons why I, of late years, have not expected the
same of you as my other pupils, so it may serve as some
alleviation to your sense of imperfection as well as to my
own disappointment. But let me advise you, as a friend,
to give up your foolish and sinful fancies and be governed
by common sense and evangelical faith in God. I wish to
part from you in friendship," and she erected her head
with self-satisfaction at her magnanimity.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; keenly felt all that was conveyed in this truly coarse
speech, though Miss Ingemann did not intend it as such.
It was simply the natural expression of a woman highly
bred by aristocratic, conventional, dogmatic life, just in
the proportion that she was vulgarized by losing sight of
the eternal principle of the equality of every immortal soul
before God, blinding herself to the truth, that if one seems
inferior to another, it is because circumstances have made
it so, or what is equally probable, because her own standard
of judgment is too low for her to see the truth as it
really is. The conviction flashed upon her pupil with
lightning force, that while she, in her simplicity, had
opened her heart to her teacher as in the presence of God,
she had been met by a severe, selfish, worldly spirit,
revealing itself quite as much through her religious wishes
in her behalf, as in her implied inferiority of caste and
mental endowment. She too erected her head and left the

<!--- vol 1 page 312 -->

room, her sorrow and self-reproach turned into a sense of
injustice and indignation.</p>

<p>In this mood of mind she ran into one of the recitation
rooms for a book, where she found her German teacher.
He had just heard from Mrs. Liebenhoff of her intention
of leaving Copenhagen, and came immediately to see her.
They gazed into each other's faces for a moment, and a
quick intelligence revealed their mutual feelings before
Zo&euml; had time to train her eye to its usual look of passionless
repose. At this moment the youngest "child of the
regiment" of school-girls, a favorite of Zo&euml; and who was
often hanging about her during her recitation, came into
the room. She was artless, and affectionate, and a great
chatterer.</p>

<p>"O dear!" said she, "you shan't go away, Zo&euml;, shall
she, Mr. Se&uuml;ll? Why don't you make her stay?" said
she. "If I were a great, strong man, I would. Do try,
won't you?" and she took a hand of each, and endeavored
to draw them together.</p>

<p>"You believe in intimations from above," said he. "O!
accept this, through one, about whom heaven lieth in her
infancy. Will you not stay? or may I not go to you?"</p>

<p>Zo&euml; said nothing, but her face expressed the opposite
feelings, striving within her.</p>

<p>"I know she will stay if you want her to; because she
told Hilda she was very sorry to give up studying German;
that she liked to speak it better than Danish."</p>

<p>"Let me interpret that," said he, "for my own soul
holds the true key to it, or I mistake me.  'Because you
can think aloud in it better than in the more northern
tongue.' Tell me that it is so."</p>

<p>She smiled and blushed, and emboldened, he approached
her. She waved him back, for the thought of her great
mission came between her and the rapture of a first affection.
Still, partly swayed by passing suggestions, various
thoughts flashed through her mind. "It may be that God

<!--- vol 1 page 313 -->

intends him for a helper in my great work. But shall I
return to my dear parents with my life's partner chosen
without their knowledge? I will not be so unfilial." She
partly turned from him, saying, "Wait but a year."</p>

<p>"What say you?" he said, not wishing to believe that he
heard aright.</p>

<p>"Be my friend for a little year," she said decidedly,
"and, in the meantime, I go to the arms of my beloved
mother."</p>

<p>"Have pity on me first," said he, "and give me surer
hope than this. I have dreamed that at last heaven was
propitious to my prayer, and was granting that in you I
might see the completion of one arc of my weird destiny,
and that in your loving care and tenderness, comfort would
flow into my stricken heart."</p>

<p>This had the opposite effect upon Zo&euml; to what was
intended, for her own life had been one of such suffering
and privation, that when she thought for a moment of the
possibility of marriage, it was as a refuge and consolation
to herself in some degree, and the oft-repeated words of
Mrs. Liebenhoff, implicating his sex for its low view of
woman, now came forcibly to her, chilling her feelings
very perceptibly.</p>

<p>He saw this, and interpreting it wrongly, said: "It may
be that far away, you will forget, in the smiles of others,
even to wait one little year."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; flashed up at the possibility of any want of truth
and rectitude in herself.</p>

<p>"Do you believe that I would trifle with your most sacred
feelings?" said she.</p>

<p>"I know well that the youthful of your sex are not without
caprice, and lack, sometimes, a faithful memory of those
they leave behind. How can I trust my fate to the few
words you have spoken, and those so enigmatical? I am
in chains, and you would sail away unshackled into the
dim distance, leaving me&mdash;"</p>

<!--- vol 1 page 314 -->

<p>"Free as the air that blows over the Carpathians from
even the bonds of friendship," said she, turning abruptly
from him and walking out of the room. If Ben Ezra,
after months' acquaintance, in which she had revealed herself
to him more than to any other one, believed her so
worldly and common-place, she wished to be bound to him
by no tie whatever; and indignant and disappointed she ran
to complete her arrangements.</p>

<p>Hilda remained with Miss Ingemann after Zo&euml; left the
room. Her teacher did not dream of her going, too; for
loving her as she had always done, she felt sure of her
being obedient in every respect to her wishes. Seeing her
in tears, she said, "I am sorry for this misguided girl.
She gives us all much trouble, but dry your eyes, my dear.
I am going into the country to pass the next Sabbath with
my friend, Mrs. Petersen, and you shall accompany me,
love. In the meantime make yourself as happy as possible,
and&mdash;perhaps you would like to assist Zo&euml; in her preparations
the next hour or two. If so, I will excuse you
from recitation this morning."</p>

<p>"I must go with Zo&euml;," said Hilda.</p>

<p>Miss Ingemann started and paused before she would
trust her voice to speak.</p>

<p>"You, my dear Hilda, my pride and joy! You will not
disappoint me by any disregard of my hopes and wishes?
Why should you go now? Another opportunity will offer
six months hence. Zo&euml; will leave this establishment in
disgrace for her willfulness and ingratitude. I wish my
<i>darling</i> to carry with her all the honors it can give her."</p>

<p>Here, too. Miss Ingemann failed in her appeal, though
to a nature very much like her own in its original characteristics.
But Hilda had been moulded by Zo&euml;, quite as
much, though more indirectly, than by her, and now that
her gentler friend was in trial, she clung to her. She had
gradually been awakening to the wide difference between
the two, and her mature preference was for the more

<!--- vol 1 page 315 -->

poetic and spiritual one, though she was not blind to the
extravagances in her development.</p>

<p>She wiped her eyes, and with as much decision and
coolness as Miss Ingemann could manifest when occasion
offered, she answered to what she considered a low motive
for her to place before her for staying. "I must go with
Zo&euml;, Miss Ingemann;" and then left her.</p>

<p>At five o'clock, all was in readiness for them to leave;
the last box corded, the last little gift exchanged with their
favorite companions, and the last kiss given to Miss Holberg,
who was in and out all day assisting them by kindly
suggestions, and exchanging many a word of affectionate
interest. The final duty was to go and bid Miss Ingemann
farewell. The latter was cold and dignified to Hilda, in
proportion as her affections and pride were more severely
wounded by the step she was taking, and Hilda acted the
same <i>r&ocirc;le</i> in a little less lofty and dignified style, while
Zo&euml; was overwhelmed with sorrow. Miss Ingemann,
partly touched by this, and partly to rebuke Hilda, with
whom she was really offended, condescended to say, "Miss
Zo&euml;, perhaps at some future time you will again visit Denmark?"
Her pupil, softened by the thought of leaving the
only home of which she had any distinct knowledge, and
her sole guardian since infancy, longed to throw herself
into her arms and respond warmly to this chilly, non-committal
invitation; but she thought what a gulf there was
between them. She never yet had uttered an untruth, and
in mournful accents and with drooping head, leaning with
sinking form on Hilda's arm, she slowly answered, "<i>No</i>."
So she went forth to meet her destiny; a reed, shaken by
every passing breeze; a wind-harp, now tuned to melody
by each gentle breath, now its cords snapped asunder by
a rude touch or gale; a vase, inclosing in its depths a store
of sweet perfume, essence, and spirit of lore and science,
by no means meagre for one so young; a failure, it is true,
in the discipline of mind deemed essential by the calculating,

<!--- vol 1 page 316 -->

critical spirit of the age; yet a trophy of success in
the great school of Christ, for she had learned of him to
be meek and lowly, at the same time that she was brave
and true to Nature and her most enlightened conscience,
and had caught a glimpse of the power and grandeur of a
life like his, and by what struggle it was to be attained, so
that, come death, come woe, or serenest happiness, it mattered
not; the goal was before her, and for that, her aim
was set, and never-ending labor.</p>

<p>As they drove away. Miss Ingemann said to Miss Holberg,
"I am more than ever convinced that there is no use
in trying to educate the masses, excepting to suit their low
position. In this instance, I have been unsuccessful, while
Zo&euml; has been a great detriment to the really superior mind
of Hilda."</p>

<p>"I feel," said Miss Holberg, weeping, "that we have
not been able to interpret her nature successfully, and
hence our disappointment. Depend upon it, she has treasures
within her, which only need the right key to unlock
them, to astonish and delight us."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" said Miss Ingemann, and stood
thoughtful for a moment. She was truly religious, and
seeing her assistant in such grief, she said, "Well, my
dear, we have striven to do our duty by her. May God
forgive us if we have been guilty of an unintentional mistake.
We can only commend her to Him now, and may
He supply what may have been lacking in our instructions."</p>

<p>The Pastor's wife watched with sinking heart, the sands
of her husband's hour-glass running silently, but none the
less surely towards eternity. In one sense, she was prepared
for this premature ultimate of a life, taxed in mind
and heart beyond the possibilities of a healthy longevity.
But more than actual exorbitant work, in its injurious
effects upon the physical system, was the heavy weight of
responsibility thrown upon him, by the want of co-operation

<!--- vol 1 page 317 -->

of the surrounding community in his labors, for what he
felt to be its absolute and imperative need. Quickened as
his soul was to a high point of spiritual insight and elevation,
the prevailing materialism, and the lack of a full and
living appreciation of the high duties devolving upon every
human being towards itself and the world, weighed upon
an already fractured constitution with destructive force.
Lacking her keen imaginative glance and ever-living hopefulness,
he was sustained in his unflagging self-devotion
by firm principle and love for truth, more than by any prospective
vision of eventual success. He was invested with
every quality of mind, character and culture incident to
humanity, save the single one of <i>passion</i> which would
have given to the others the magnetic dart, necessary to
pierce through the heavy crust with which mammon and
sense had covered up the hearts of his people. But all
was over, and she, like Marius upon the ruins of Carthage,
sat upon the grave of her desolated hopes, and thus
her soul sighed out its dirge, broken in its strains by the
anguish of many loving friends of his flock, no less than
by the sense of her own life-loss.</p>

<p>After due care and observance, Ben Ezra left the remains
of the dead to bid a more satisfactory farewell to
Zo&euml;, than she, in her impatient excitement, had allowed
him. As he passed the quay, he saw a ship with its sails
fully set, just sailing away into the thick mist, which at the
hour of evening was enveloping the harbor. He inquired
of a bystander its name and commander, and found it was
the one in which she and Hilda had embarked. A double
sense of desolation settled on his spirit. His dearest friend
in the present scene of his lengthened experience had just
departed, and now the hope, which had gilded his latest
life, was fast fading away into the grave which the ages
had been lowering and ever lowering. Thus he wailed
out his lament:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"Gone! gone! another ray of sunshine over my pathway stealing.<br/>

How long, O Lord, how long dost thou deny my heart's sore
pleading!<br/>

Am I the sport of a blind destiny, the caprice of a stern fate?<br/>

Who ever answereth to my anguished cry for love&mdash;too late, too
late!<br/>

Enlighten me, O Father, upon the purpose of my wandering!<br/>

Unvail to me thy great designs on which I tire of pondering.<br/>

Give me, O give me life in love! that I, renewed for aye,<br/>

May ever worship God, through Christ, and toil for his humanity!<br/>

For lo! from age to age, phenomenal, I gather,<br/>

With the assemblies of the people&mdash;one with them&mdash;yet, alas!

Give me, O give me life in love! that I, renewed for aye,<br/>

May ever worship God, through Christ, and toil for his humanity!</p>

<p>Zo&euml; fades from my light, like the mist of the night.</p>

<p>Call to me, Ocean, from thy deepest soundings,<br/>

Blow to me, breezes, from thy remotest boundings,<br/>

Stars, from your blue profoundest shine articulate,<br/>

Sun, with your melting beams, her love perpetuate!</p>

<p>No answer comes from them to my deep heart's appealing.</p>

<p>Speak to me, my deepest nature,<br/>

Reveal the presage of the future.<br/>

Hush all discordant whisperings,<br/>

Listen to its revealings.</p>

<p>No answer comes to me from its abysses.</p>

<p>Woe! woe! is me! the oracle of all Time is dumb,<br/>

Lonely and sad I wander. God! do thou yet sustain!<br/>

Still be my light, my life's exceeding gain,<br/>

<p>"I have been thinking, if there
were any so simple and unlearned
that I could dedicate my book to
them, and it has come into my mind
that you, my little ones, may have preserved your child-like
temper, so as to receive it in the spirit in which it was

<!--- vol 1 page 323 -->

written. There are plenty of shrewd and knowing people,
who will tell me if it is formed according to the rules laid
down for authors, if the sentences are too long, if the facts
agree with the time stated, if the characters speak and act
as they ought to, and make many other remarks upon it
which you would not, and I hope, never will understand.
But I wish to give it in charge to those who will love it for
its <i>spirit</i>, its <i>deepest meaning;</i> so I come to you, and if a
part of it is too old for you now to take a lively interest in
it, you will, I hope, grow to like it better by-and-by.</p>

<p>"My children, you know all too well that we are left
without his guidance, who was ever faithful and loving in
his instructions to us, so we must be all the more true and
earnest in laboring for ourselves. He loved each and all
of you, little ones. It cheered him, each Sabbath morning,
to come to you, and look into your sunny eyes, and mark
your obedient attention when he spoke to you of God and
Jesus. And when weighed down in spirit by the lack
of interest of his older hearers in the truth he gave them,
which was dearer than his own life to him, he would say:
'The children will drink into their young hearts its beauty
and purity, and their souls will bud and bloom into sweet
flowers for the garden of our God; and they will build a
temple for his worship, and each of them shall be a living
stone in it, polished to fittest grace and loveliness.'</p>

<p>"And now that he is gone, they say, 'we cannot rebuild
our church, so we will leave it as it is, a wreck for passers-by
to gaze at, and, may-be, scoff for our lukewarmness.'</p>

<p>"My children, <i>we</i> will build the church, new and complete
in every part, a fit offering to the great, good Father
and our Redeemer. Come one, come all, Mary, and Freya,
and Edgar, and Carl, and Gunhilda, and Louise, and Eva,
and Fritz, and many more that I cannot name. <i>We</i> will
dig stones from the quarry and fashion them into a glorious
church, worthy of our Maker, and the souls he gave us;
and the few faithful ones, who loved to teach and talk to

<!--- vol 1 page 324 -->

you of the way to be good and happy here, and afterwards
in heaven, will lend a helping hand, when most it may be
needed. And little Petrea shall sing for us, meanwhile,
the simple song she learns at school, and Meta shall come
and dance for us, and if she trips with graceful step to
help, by her playful, winning ways, to build a temple where
she can learn of Him, who loved more than all else, little
children, then she will grow up and never be proud and
vain because of her 'flouncy gown.'</p>

<p>"Do you ask, how we shall have strength and money
enough to build our church? Never fear, my children.
'God will provide.' Only begin with loving hearts and an
earnest purpose, and the sweet heavens and every gracious
influence of earth will aid us. Never fear, but commence
the work in fullest trust and love, and more than the half
is done.</p>

<p>"What shall its form be, do you say? It shall grow
into grace and beauty under our hands, even as a forest-tree.
Strong and massive shall it be, to live for ages, so
that our children's children shall see where their parents
worshiped, and say, 'we will praise God even more worthily
than they, because of their blest instructions and the ever-living,
growing action of our own souls combined.'</p>

<p>"Its pointed doors and windows shall uplift us as
we gaze towards the heavens. Its two towers, one surmounted
by an anchor, the other by a cross, shall speak to
us of consecration of ourselves to duty, however trying,
and of high hope combined. Its shell, with open ear, shall
teach us to be awake and listening to every hint borne to
us from God without and God within us. Its pillars,
many-branched, shall, like the trees, tell us of God, walking
amid the cool wood's shade, of which our temple shall
be a symbol. The angel blowing the trumpet over the
preacher's desk, shall ever prompt him to utter the whole
sacred, needed truth, as it flows in upon him.</p>

<p>"It shall be light, airy, and home-like, with the seats all

<!--- vol 1 page 325 -->

rounding towards one centre, as if we loved, one the other,
and liked to look into each other's faces, and wished no
one to hide himself in a dark corner, where he might steal
the Word, but lack the sympathetic charm of loving hearts,
which gives it half its potency. The minister will give us
in simple, earnest fashion, the pure truth of Christ. He
will read, too, of God's dealings to his people before his
coming; and then of his full, consummated truth, exemplified
by his great life. And we will chant the psalms and
hymns together&mdash;turning our faces towards the choir and
organ&mdash;each one as he best may, with melody of utterance,
or by the sincere and voiceless spirit.</p>

<p>"It shall be adorned with pictures, which speak to us, at
times, even with plainer voice than words. The infant
Jesus, in his sweet mother's arms; she, smiling upon us,
saying, 'Lo! this beloved, holy child is a new era in the
world's life. Love and grow like him, and the spirit within
you shall be pure, tender, beautiful, strong and mighty to
prevail over the inner and the outer world as his was.'</p>

<p>"Christ, walking upon the water, an emblem of the
electric spirit's potency, shall be a hint to us of the power
of the coming future. The Prodigal Son, welcomed by
his Father, will show us the forgiving love of God for sinners.
And we will not forget our <i>suffering</i> Saviour, for
his crucifixion tells us trumpet-tongued, of the high cost
of every man's redemption; for, not alone by Jesus dying
to ease, to glory, and to earthly love; nor by his resignation
to what God appointed, but by our own likewise, do
we gain the crown, and reign as conquerors over sin and
ruin forevermore.</p>

<p>"We will build high our church, with steps ascending
to it, so that the 'Children's Chapel' underneath shall have
full air and sunshine. It shall be broad and spacious, even
as the Church above, for many will come to our Sunday-school,
I ween.</p>

<p>"Pictures shall be here too; Christ blessing little children;

<!--- vol 1 page 326 -->

holy ones praising God with prayer and song, and
many others, with medallions and statuettes, such as you
will love to look on. I have many ready for our Chapel
now, my own.</p>

<p>"It shall be open each Sunday evening too. Sometimes
we will gather to hear one, who can tell us well of the
wonders of the stars. Again another shall teach us of the
beauty and high uses of the trees and flowers; another, of
the marvels of the tinted shell, linking each with thoughts
of God, and his many-sided goodness, loveliness and
power. And thus the Pastor will be relieved and cheered
by the aid of many minds, intent like him, upon spreading
God's truth and love, and making our lives harmonious
therewith. Sometimes, too, we will meet in our Chapel-home
for social converse, brightened by intelligence and
thought, and warmed by sympathetic interest in high
themes.</p>

<p>"And now, I am going to speak to you, my children, of
what many pious people will think a very sinful plan, but
it is not nevertheless, to my simple faith. So be attentive
to me. You know that the Sabbath was given us to rest
from labor, to grow good, to do good, and be happy in.
God has not told us exactly how, though all the ages have
pointed to the Church and its simple and holy ordinances, as
one great means of becoming thus; so every Sunday morning,
if possible, we will come to church; and in the afternoon,
there are so many good books to read, it seems a
very pleasant way to spend the hours in, to learn something
from <i>their</i> teachings. But sometimes, on Sunday
evenings, we will have dramatic representations in our
Chapel. Is it so very dreadful? You have felt, I dare
say, after being serious all day long, as if you would like
to sport and play. God put this love of change into your
feelings. You only must learn to guide it rightly. It is
no more wicked to laugh than weep, indeed much less so,
I think, in a world which God has made purposely for us

<!--- vol 1 page 327 -->

to be happy in. So we will be merry a part of Sunday,
will we not?</p>

<p>"And do you not think, if a little boy or girl were striving
very hard to grow up good, and wished to learn how,
in every way he could, that, if he saw, represented by living
persons, the struggles, trials, and at last the victory of
some great and good man or woman, who had toiled from
childhood for this high aim, that he would learn as much,
as if he went to a darkened church three times each Sunday,
to hear a gloomy-looking man say in the morning, over
and over again, 'that sin is exceeding sinful;' and in the
afternoon, tell of the 'terrors of the law,' and in the evening,
'that God was going to burn up a multitude of his
children for ever and ever?'</p>

<p>"I think we should learn a great deal more. So the
young people, with little trouble and preparation, will use
the talent which has been given them, for some good purpose,
to make our Sabbath evenings happy and beneficial
to us.</p>

<p>"And now, I go into the sweet country and the bright
tinted woods to gather comfort and hope again from their
refreshing influences. Farewell, my children, and when I
return, come to me, for a little while, and a few at a time;
for I have much to do, and your noisy prattle when too
long listened to, disturbs the current of my many thoughts.
And you shall see my pictures, and select one, each of
you, as you best like; for I have many which have been
suggestions to me while I wrote my book for you, and
which I will with pleasure give to my little friends. Farewell."</p>

<p>WE must now return to Santa Cruz and give a hasty
sketch of the fortunes of George Carlan and his wife,
during the twelve years' absence of their daughter in
Denmark.</p>

<p>It will be recollected that the former, in emerging from
slavery, had placed before himself two objects for which
to live and labor&mdash;wealth, and independence; or as it may
be expressed in one phrase, independence through wealth.
Towards these his aims were directed and his ambitious
hopes constantly aspiring.</p>

<p>Sophia, on the contrary, affectionate and retiring, as she
was, shared but in a slight degree her husband's restless
wishes; and if ever her thoughts were turned towards his
favorite goal, and her imagination excited by his visions of
distant good attained through these means, it was that he
and her child, more than herself, might win the happiness
which would accrue from their possession.</p>

<p>Mr. Carlan's industry and enterprise had been crowned
with success so far as to place them in comfortable circumstances.
Indeed, in comparison with most of his tribe, he
was wealthy and was regarded with consideration by his
own caste. But his affluence gave him no honorable <i>position</i>
among the white Creoles of the island. To-be-sure,

<!--- vol 2 page 6 -->

he had business relations with them, and the Danish officials
treated him with a half friendly, half condescending
familiarity, which was anything but agreeable. But by the
English residents he was looked upon with distrust and
aversion as an ambitious, discontented man, who was to be
avoided and scorned on every possible occasion to prevent
his impertinent encroachments upon their dignity and aristocratic
rights. As these latter saw their power and influence
decline in the island just in proportion to the losses
and poverty incurred by their miserable management of
their property, spendthrift habits, and ruinous absenteeism,
so in the same ratio did they hate the Irish emigrants into
whose hands their estates had fallen, or the colored people
who, through their enterprise, were seizing upon their
commerce and manufactures.</p>

<p>Had George Carlan, when he emerged from slavery,
possessed a true idea of the value of freedom in its relations
to the training and development of the human soul
above all things else, he would have been saved much bitterness
of feeling and many heartaches, and in the end
have prospered much better also in his worldly affairs.
For by this principle deeply-rooted and acting vitally upon
his daily life, he would have gained a self-possession equal
to every emergency, an insight into the laws of commercial
intercourse, and proper appreciation of the forces of
nature, and the due balance to be preserved between the
consumption of the products in which he dealt and the law
of their supply, quite indispensable to success in any business
department. This, too, would have given him that
patient reliance on Providence in untoward seasons, and
that geniality and kindness of demeanor in his social and
business relations, which are better than a capital of thousands
to one who launches forth on the sea of commercial
life. But these ideas he had had no opportunity of learning
in slavery, and it was not to be expected that he would begin
his career as a merchant under better auspices, in these

<!--- vol 2 page 7 -->

respects, than multitudes, who commence life with none
of his disadvantages. Still he had much skill, shrewdness,
and industry, and for several years his success was without
a drawback, and, as was remarked in the commencement
of this story, he was enabled to surround himself and
family with not only the comforts, but many of the luxuries
of life.</p>

<p>But in his social relations he was, as it were, between
two fires. On the one hand, he was looked down upon,
yet dreaded and contemned by the whites. On the other,
in proportion as he was separated from the blacks by his
mixed caste, his ambitious aspirations, and his gentlemanly,
and it must be confessed, haughty bearing and more
luxurious surroundings, so was he hated, suspected, and
even scorned by them. Many a time, in the market and
on the highway, as he passed along through groups of
laborers, or even met the convict-troop on their way to
work upon the roads, did he hear the muttered sentence:
"Black man get along very well with Buckra before
colored man come; he make all the trouble." This, of
course, did not increase his sympathy for his race, or give
him much hope of aiding them in their uprising. On the
contrary, he grew more and more moody and silent as the
years went by, more discontented with his position, and
more hopeless of taking his stand side by side with the
haughty whites. Absorbed in business as he was, he
gained no higher tastes with which to occupy his few
leisure hours, so that he too often, instead of bringing
sunshine and strength to his home, distressed Sophia by
throwing out hints of his determination to leave the island
altogether and go to Denmark, or better still, to more
sunny and genial, and hospitable France.</p>

<p>How, in the meantime, did she, the more simple, refined,
and retiring nature, fare in this rude, conflicting war of the
different elements which made up the social life of her
adopted island? In one sense better, in another worse.

<!--- vol 2 page 8 -->

She and her husband were very unlike in temperament
and character. He, with his admixture of Anglo-Saxonism,
partook very largely of its more striking characteristics.
He was proud, self-respecting, practical, and grave. She,
on the other hand, had the traits of the poetic, artistic, religious
African. The white tinge in her cheek came, too,
from French extraction on the maternal side, which modified
her character to a tone more graceful and spirituelle.
Her mother was from Martinique, a slave in a prominent
family in that island, and favorite cook of the establishment.
The father of Sophia was the son of her master,
and she had dim recollections of being fondled, in her
infancy, by a handsome young man under the shade of the
banana trees which surrounded their hut. When about
eighteen years old, her master and mistress came to
Santa Cruz on a visit, bringing her as one of their attendants.
Wishing to show their appreciation of the hospitality
of their host and hostess, they gave Sophia to their eldest
daughter as a parting gift. In the course of two or three
years after this event the young lady died of a painful and
lingering disease, in which the slave-girl watched her by
night and day. Through this companionship of suffering
on one side, and of tender, devoted, and sympathizing alleviation
on the other, there grew up between them a strong
affection. Elinor, for that was the young lady's name,
could hardly permit her out of her sight. No hand could
smooth so suitably as hers the pillow for her aching head,
the bitter draught lost half its loathsomeness when held to
her lips by her gentle bondwoman, and when she was away,
her eye would wander restlessly around the room for her
favorite attendant. Sophia had learned, previously to this
time, how to read imperfectly, and soon her young mistress
preferred her slow, interrupted articulation of passages
from her favorite authors to the more finished enunciation
of her own sisters. Here was a spur to improvement in
this art, so that she learned to read with much propriety in

<!--- vol 2 page 9 -->

this her primary school both of literature and bereavement.
For, at one time of that mysterious, dead hush of nature,
which attends the hours of early morning in the hottest
summer nights, when it seems an effort for even the well and
strong to keep the vital spark from failing, this delicate
southern flower folded its petals, drooped, and faded away
into the dull hue of death, exhaling its latest breath into
the ear of her beloved nurse in the form of the glad tidings
of&mdash;"Liberty to the captive." So she was free, and ere-long
she was a freeman's wife, and the wild rapture of her
betrothal, the bliss of her bridal eve, the chastened delight
of her first room of motherhood were all blended in her
mind, hallowing it by their influence, with that sad but
sweet death-bed scene, and with those entrancing words,
toned down to tenderest, softest accents by her young mistress's
failing breath, of "Ye are free, inasmuch as ye have
willingly done all this for me."</p>

<p>Until Zo&euml;'s departure, scarcely a shade had come across
her wedded life. Her husband, though much engrossed
by his business, was kind and affectionate, and she had so
much gladness within herself, that his occasional fits of
abstraction and silence were not much heeded by her,
especially as she was ever pretty successful in withdrawing
him from them by her playful chit-chat. When Zo&euml;
was born, after a three years' marriage, her happiness was
complete, for the care of her child filled up the hours of
her husband's absence, and she had no ambitious designs
of a foreign culture for her, and no corroding anxiety for
a higher station than her present one in the associations
of the island. With no relatives of her own there, she had
chosen her companions very much as her natural affinities
led her, so that they were among the best of her class, and
with a strong, instinctive love of nature leading her daily
into the most beautiful haunts within reach of her home,
she was less dependent upon social intercourse than was
common among her people.</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 10 -->

<p>Her husband's relations were of a very mingled character,
both as it regarded color, habits, and general development.
Some were in slavery, some free, but none of them
had enjoyed the same early advantages as himself; for he
was a trusty servant to one of the best English residents,
and had caught much of the tone of mind and manner of
his master and his household.</p>

<p>They, on the contrary, even the emancipated, had less
sense of character, less idea of the discipline necessary to
enable them to make the most of their freedom, and were,
therefore, thriftless, improvident, and disposed to rely very
much on him for assistance and support. They attributed
his greater success to good luck; were ever bemoaning
their own hard lot; comparing, in a discontented spirit, their
fortunes with his; repining at their own sufferings and
struggles; and, at the same time, congratulating him with
sinister look and tone upon his exemption from them. All
this was a great trial to Mr. Carlan, and he tried to remedy
their difficulties as much as possible; but, of course, time
was requisite to heal all the evils entailed upon them by
their former slavery.</p>

<p>Sophia's quick woman's wit and keener spiritual insight,
saw that the trouble rested very much upon their indolent
habits, and want of judgment, and that, while men and
women in stature, they were but children in character, and
mental and social habits. They wasted their earnings by
thriftlessness, and then came to her husband to make up
their losses, and yet were angry if either of them suggested
a different and better course of conduct for them.
They quarreled among themselves and appealed to him as
an umpire; and yet loaded him with abuse, if, in mediating
between them, he ventured to condemn, though in the
most careful manner, the conduct of either party, so that
he was constantly perplexed and anxious on their account.
All this served to imbitter him still more when he thought
of the rank which the colored people held in the island.

<!--- vol 2 page 11 -->

He was sufficiently advanced himself to see the evils resulting
to them from the prevailing prejudice against caste
and color, at the same time, that he had but little hope,
and saw less and less prospect of their taking soon a
different position. The curse of slavery still hung over
this beautiful island, and its effects were most deadly and
disheartening; and in the little world of his relations the
several acts of its fearful tragedy were daily enacting.</p>

<p>"My dear," said Sophia to him one day, "I really think
it is better for you not to give your brother Fred so much
money as you do. He does not spend it prudently. I
met him this afternoon driving two horses tandem, and
dressed in a style which you do not allow in yourself, and
really his wife quite outshines me in her finery."</p>

<p>"I know it, Sophia. I try to have him more thrifty and
saving, but I can't make much impression upon him. He
has been miserably brought up, poor fellow! what can we
expect of him?"</p>

<p>"I know we must make allowances, of course; but really
your money injures him, I think. It prevents his depending
upon his own industry and fosters his spendthrift habits.
Besides, it is not right on your own account. Here you are
working from morning to night, and pouring out your means
like water to one and another, and when I get tired of being
alone, and beg you to stroll on the sea-beach with me, or
sit under the veranda and enjoy the cool breeze, you say
you have so much to do that you cannot. I really think
Fred ought to depend on himself more, and his children
should be trained to industry by necessity, if not willingly.
Character is worth more to them than any amount of presents
from you. Tell him so, will you not, dear, next time
he asks you for money?"</p>

<p>"Sophia, he is my only brother; I must help him or he
would soon suffer. I cannot make up my mind to tell him
so either. I know I work hard for my income, but as it is
mine I must do as I think best with it."</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 12 -->

<p>His wife was silent and subdued, but, though a colored
woman, with the quick, instinctive, moral sense of her
race, and acute natural idea of justice, she was not able to
see, any more than her white sisters under the same circumstances,
how it happened, that when they began their
married life together, with scarcely a stiver, and she had,
by her own industry and good management, helped to make
their home comfortable and tasteful, and by her economy
in saving their earnings, had served to increase their means,
that they should be so coolly, and quite as a matter of
course, appropriated by himself, and she, in the meantime,
be made to feel as a dependent and intruder if she alluded
to the mode of their expenditure. Still she was happy,
and able, therefore, to dispel all such unpleasant reflections
which might be forced upon her.</p>

<p>But year after year passed, and matters grew worse and
worse. George was more discontented and gloomy, less
than ever at home, and more and more silent when there.
Sophia watched with a beating heart his dark and brooding
countenance, and strove by endearments and delicate attentions
to withdraw him from himself and become once more
to him what she was in the first years of their marriage.</p>

<p>Not that he was unkind to her. He would have been
shocked had he been told that he was negligent in his
home-duties, and cruel towards the tender, loving spirit,
who had given her affections and happiness into his keeping.
By the sophism, that business was all important, and
that, by providing her with abundant food and clothing, he
was fulfilling the pledge he had given her on their marriage
eve, he silenced any reproaches which might arise
within him as he saw her move about their dwelling with
abated spirits, or detected traces of tears on her morning
face instead of the bright expression of days gone by.</p>

<p>But with all this absorption in business, he did not prosper
as well as at first. As his spirits darkened and he
grew morose and suspicious, he ceased to be the favorite

<!--- vol 2 page 13 -->

that he had been with the captains of vessels and other
strangers who visited the island. So that his yearly profits
were less and less, and with the diminution of moral force
of character, he was more and more imposed upon by his
eager relatives. Thus his property sensibly diminished
from year to year. This was readily perceived by Sophia,
who adapted her expenditures accordingly. The French,
it is well known, have wonderful capabilities in providing
nutritious and attractive repasts from slender materials.
Sophia had profited by the early instructions of her mother,
and was an adept in all kinds of cheap, yet elegant cookery.
She dismissed some of her servants to suit the exigencies
of their lot, and occupied herself more with her domestic
affairs. But in this course she went too far, for, by exerting
herself too much in household exercise, debilitating in its
effect in a hot climate, she brought on an illness, which
put an end to the hope which had given her fresh joy, that
soon, in the care of a new object of affection, her constant
sense of Zo&euml;'s loss might be relieved.</p>

<p>Her husband, aroused to the idea of his wife's critical
situation, insisted upon it that she should work less at home
and live more, as she was so fond of doing, in the open
air among her favorite haunts. He even gave some more
time each day to her care and diversion, and something
like by-gone happiness revisited them.</p>

<p>But as he saw her recover her accustomed strength and
health, he returned to his old habits of busy toil during the
day, and silent, moody, or sleepy evenings, and she was
thrown more and more upon herself.</p>

<p>And yet she was not alone, for, to the true lover of
nature every tree is a support to the spirit as much as to
the leaning frame&mdash;every sound of its waving leaves, when
touched by the breeze, is a gentle whisper of the Almighty
to the quickened ear of het who stands and reverently
listens. Each flower is a smile, brighter or more tender,
of the beauty-loving Artist of the universe. Each tiny

<!--- vol 2 page 14 -->

moss-cup is a hint of God's ever-watchful care and supervision
of the lowliest of his children. Each brilliant shell
and sparkling coral, as it is thrown up from the deep, murmurs
of infinite love and joy. Every bird warbles in its
song of its intimate communion with the spirit who gave it
its little harp, from whose strings gush forth such melody,
and she tunes her own inner flute to harmonious liquid
measures; and the great ocean, with its roar and surge,
is but a fitting accompaniment to the full organ-tones,
which swell almost to bursting from the over-soul within
her.</p>

<p>Sophia was without the education of the schools, nor
was her mind trained to subtlety and shrewdness by the
current literature and philosophy of the day, any more than
her tastes were shrunken to dainty dillettanteism, or her
character warped to suit the <i>vulgar loftiness</i> of tone of
modern, fashionable, conventional life. But God be
thanked for the great school, which, through our dear
mother Nature, he has opened for the souls of his children,
for the high seminary of which Jesus is the head, where
we may learn the great principles for the government of ourselves
and the nations; and for the university of life where
we may acquire, at the same time that we put in practice,
the rules which are to fit us for, and conduct us through
the eternities. Sophia was a docile pupil in all these
schools. She daily sat at the feet of each prophet and
seer, both in the Book handed down from the ages and in
"God manifest" near her on the sea-shore, and mountain-top,
and mahogany grove, and her spirit grew under their
influence till in its beauty, and richness, and perpetual
vitality, it surpassed the luxurious vegetation of her tropical
island. For so wonderfully has God adapted himself,
his visible creation, and us to each other, that we have but
to put ourselves in loving relationship with them, through
their various voices and intonations, and second their
efforts in our training by obedience to their wholesome

<!--- vol 2 page 15 -->

methods and gentle admonitions, and we grow into symmetry
and loveliness like the tamarind tree or the star-jasmin,
and the fragrance of our lives arises sweeter to
heaven than the odor of the orange tree. This lesson has
the midnight student yet to learn, who shuts himself up
day after day from the sweet air, and the dancing sunlight,
and the cheerful voices of his kind to bury himself among
the dusty tomes of the past, till his brain aches, and his face
becomes wizard-like, and his hand is palsied by grasping his
ponderous volumes, and life, nature, man, and God, take
nightmare shapes in his view, so that when he pens his
lucubrations, they darken more than enlighten mankind.</p>

<p>But it is not well for us to dwell too much alone, and
Sophia suffered in this respect. She lived on pleasant
terms with her neighbors, and was affectionate and kind to
her husband's relatives. But they were all unlike and
very inferior to herself. One family, of a sister of her husband,
she hoped much from in the way of companionship.
They had natural refinement and were better taught, in
some ways, than the other sisters and nieces. But their
false position in the society of the island showed itself in
a way peculiarly disagreeable to her taste and moral sense.
They led a melo-dramatic life, as it were, acting not from
the spontaneous impulse of simple, truthful minds, but with
an eye to effect and admiration.</p>

<p>"Aunt Sophia," said Eliza Larkin one afternoon, as she
sauntered into her parlor, "I have come to sit with you a
little while, and see if you cannot cheer me, for I am very
drooping to-day."</p>

<p>"Ah! what has happened, dear; you look well. No bad
news I hope from Thomas?"</p>

<p>"O no! he was well yesterday, and his employer has
raised his salary; but I often suffer from low spirits. Lieutenant
Heidrich, who was at our house last evening, noticed
this, and told me that my pensiveness was very becoming,"
and she cast up her eye towards the ceiling and sighed.</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 16 -->

<p>"When is Thomas coming home?" said Mrs. Carlan.</p>

<p>"Next month, I believe. Have you heard from cousin
Zo&euml; lately, aunty?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. We had a letter by the last ship, and she
sent much love to all her cousins. I thought I told
you."</p>

<p>"I dare say. Did she ever write of the Baroness Von
Worm? Lieutenant Heidrich says that I remind him of
her; that I have an expression in my eye which he never
saw in any one but hers," and she opened and shut them
several times with great emphasis.</p>

<p>"No, I think Zo&euml; does not know her. She speaks of
Mrs. Liebenhoff, and Mrs. K&ouml;rner, and a few others; but
she has not very many acquaintances outside her school."</p>

<p>"I went to the Governor General's last levee with Uncle
Fred, and the Danish officers were very attentive to me,
and I heard one of them say that I was the handsomest
girl in the room;" and she raised her hand to brush aside
her curls.</p>

<p>Her aunt said nothing to this, and she continued.</p>

<p>"I wore my blue tarleton, with my new bertha, which is
edged with real lace, and Lieutenant Heidrich put a lovely
red rose in my hair, and said that it set off to good advantage
my luxurious beauty."</p>

<p>"My dear Eliza, I hope you will not suffer your head
to be bewildered and your heart turned away from Thomas,
your good lover, by Lieutenant Heidrich or any other
Danish gentlemen. Depend upon it he means no good to
you by his flatteries. Heed my words, love, will you
not?"</p>

<p>Eliza grew sullen, and said but little more before leaving;
and Sophia's heart sank within her at the thought of
the easy virtue of the women of her people, whom the
taint of slavery still infected in the holiest sanctuary of
married life, and blasted the hopes with which the truth of
loving hearts was plighted.</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 17 -->

<p>Thus Mrs. Carlan had but a limited companionship,
either with her busy husband or with her low-toned relatives
and neighbors. Her own being was constantly growing
through the natural influences upon it of life, nature,
and the Word of God, while no one kept even pace with
her, so as to balance it by a sympathetic expansion and
support. She was constantly receiving strength and inspiration,
while she could ordinarily give out only what her
friends were capable of absorbing&mdash;the mere surface-workings
of her soul. Imprisoned, as she was, to all intents
and purposes by the conventional walls which society had
built up around her, she could no more act out fully her
highest self, than when she was a slave, could she go at
her own will from island to island.</p>

<p>In Santa Cruz she was an exceptional person. Perhaps
another could not be found of a similar development, so
few influences are there to rouse human nature to its fullest
action. But in our own free land society is full of
women, restless, discontented, and morbid from a painful
sense of repression. Some strong, energetic spirits in the
higher walks of life, who unfortunately feel themselves
exempted either by the possession of wealth or by pride
of caste, from the common labor of their households, and
who have a nervous dread of any of the unfashionable ideas
about woman's rights, spend their lives in trifling occupations,
insisting upon it that their sphere is sufficiently large
for them. They think, perhaps, that their frequent fits of
ennui, the <i>blues</i>, or whatever other name may be given to
nervous depression and melancholy, are quite in the common
course of human nature, though a disagreeable phase of it.
So, if young, they emerge from a ten days' fit of complaining
ill-temper, and sadness combined, to expand themselves
to a broader circumference in hooped skirts, extensive
collars, latitudinary plaits of hair, and marvellous hats,
astounding by their showy quality just in proportion to their
diminishing quantity, and rearward tendency. If matrons

<!--- vol 2 page 18 -->

and housekeepers, they make up for their stinted normal
action of mind by devoting themselves to spacious mansions,
mirrors, and showy upholstery, which suggest that
Aladdin's lamp should ever be in their possession; and to
entertainments which vie with the extravagant waste of the
ancient Romans in the days of their voluptuous decline.</p>

<p>Some, stung to desperation by our falsities of thought
and life, mount the rostrum and the pulpit, and, Pythoness-like,
screech out their denunciations against our slaveries,
monopolies, and frauds, and get hooted at for their fury and
zeal. And there is some truth of feeling in the condemnation
of society, though it may be sinning to the very extent
of their accusations; for, if one has a truth in advance
of the age, it should be regarded as a precious trust and
deposit; it should be hovered over by the soul, with the
brooding love of a bird for its young; it should be fed
with the choicest nutriment to be found under God's canopy;
ay, and He should be wrestled with by the strong arm
of prayer until he nurture it from his own storehouse above.
It should be aired by the fresh breezes which blow all
about us, so that it contract no rust or taint from our own
possible mental stagnancy. Above all, it should nestle in
the most loving nook of our hearts, and in its warmth it
should abide until its sweetest song is panting to warble
forth of itself, and its pinions are so strong that it can
ever mount higher and higher without wish to return again
to the earth or the home of its infancy. Then, its clear,
musical note entrances and wins, and men cannot but listen
and learn from its song the lyrics of the skies.</p>

<p>Others, with gentle accents and tearful eyes, speak out
the thought that is in them, an evidence of their earnestness,
though it may not be strong enough to bear up the
listeners to the point of their own interest and fervor.
Others still, in individual and associated action show their
powers of direction, and thus give expression to their
benevolence. Some issue their prettily turned thoughts in

<!--- vol 2 page 19 -->

verse and fiction with facility and pleasure and gain by this
relief, and in the world's acceptance and praise the happiness
they ask for.</p>

<p>But what shall she do whose tastes, culture, disposition,
and aversion to prominent leadership point to no satisfactory
division of labor in society as it is, but who sees the
necessity of a still greater upheaving of old principles and
customs and modes of thought and action before she can
take her full share of the work of society upon her shoulders?
Her daily life is an ideal one, but she has outlived
the period when she thought it necessary and right to push
it aside, cover it up, or extinguish it altogether, in order to
fulfill God's appointments for her in the world. She has
measured it by the Christian standard, and it compares
well with that, and she sees that to live the same is the
vital necessity of the world no less than of herself. She
looks abroad and beholds signs on every side of the need
of a higher life, and prognostications of its approach, though
it limps, and wanders, and seems sometimes almost lost on
its way. Restrained, as she is, by the laws of her own
being, which have become to her a primary revelation,
kept within her accustomed sphere by reverence and regard
for the beloved and revered, whose feebler and less piercing
imaginative glance discerns not what is clear to her in
coming futurity, prevented from full expression, lest she
should alarm them by what they would deem the vagaries
of insanity, what, we ask again, can <i>she</i> do when the truth
is as clear as a sunbeam to her that the feminine element,
as expressed by the religion of Jesus, and which all along,
in the world's history, has been in abeyance, is to lead on
the ages of the future? The feminine element! not merely
in woman of course, but wherever it may be found, in all
the different races, conditions, and castes, but which needs
something more than the timid, slow, and compromising
means put in force by the men of this generation, however
sincere they may be, to give it supremacy. In the prevailing

<!--- vol 2 page 20 -->

skepticism of the day, the abandonment of churches and
growing disbelief in the Scriptures, she sees how much
the intellect of the age is in advance of its creeds and
forms. In magnetism, spiritualism, and other forms of
psychological development, she discerns a growth of soul,
hitherto scarcely dreamed of on this side heaven. It
shows itself at present in startling, awkward, abnormal
ways, but by little and little it comes under obedience to
legitimate laws, and, ere-long, will adjust itself to natural,
simple, but elevated philosophical rules. What, I say, can
she do, when she sees all this, and, in the new order of
things, opening to society through these means, recognizes
her extended sphere of action, but bide her time, and
nourish, and, at the same time, keep within bounds her
struggling, fluttering faith, and subdue herself to the
patience needed for the slow and wearisome hours? She
rises in the morning, not to tire herself with labor, for she
finds not sufficient of the same to suit her present development.
On the contrary, the struggle is to repress her
powers to her limited exigencies and means, to still herself
to endure the world's present slow march of progress in
spiritual life, to do her part meekly in the humble now,
when her plans are squared to the broad spaces of the
glorious future. The masculine minds around her point
to the past, and weary her with old saws and maxims of
the times gone by, when she hints of her hopes of the
coming era! And well they may, for that has been their
sphere in which her account was small. But the future
belongs to the feminine power, and in that is her home,
and there will she find her crown of rejoicing. Thus
dying to the past, while awakening to the future, upon
which no one looks with her prophetic vision, and, therefore,
her words are but as idle tales to her companions,
there is nothing left her but to write, write. So she covers
sheet after sheet with her burning thoughts, that thus the
fervor of her soul may allay itself, and as she weaves, day

<!--- vol 2 page 21 -->

by day this bright-colored web of her destiny, whose warp
is of lightning and its woof of the mid-day sunbeams, she
is but half relieved of the fire which flames through her
whole being. O! then comes to her, like the draught of
cooling water in the desert, our holy religion, bathing her
spirit so that it is subdued yet not weakened. It paints
before her mind's eye scenes as beautiful, but more true
than the mirage in the skies of the east. It bids her wait
patiently for the fulfillment of her visions, trusting in a
power greater than her own, at the same time that it points
with directing finger to the work which will leave her no
sense of insufficiency, but will glorify and brighten her
daily lot with the pomp and radiance of the heavens.</p>

<p>But Sophia Carlan had not the ready aid of her pen to
relieve her mind in its preternatural operations. She was
in delicate health. She was lonely and longed for the
companionship of her child, and in her husband she found
but scanty sympathy, proportioned to the increasing demands
of her nature. So that, like many at the present
day in this country, the <i>over-soul</i> spilled itself out in weird,
abnormal ways. She became a somnambulist, and was
subject to trances, which frightened him, and to clairvoyance,
which puzzled while it filled him with dread. He
was not without superstition, and at first he feared some
evil spirit had got possession of her, yet, as she was always
in a happy and elevated state when in them, he gradually
lost this feeling, but at the same time kept her away from
all prying eyes when under their influence. Such was
their mutual condition when an event long looked forward
to, but sudden at the last, occurred in the island. The
dark gathering clouds shot their bolt of lightning, and
uttered their peal of thunder, awful to the unprepared,
but healthful and invigorating in their tendency to the
waiting and longing who saw beyond the war of the elements
the bow of promise arched above.</p>

<p>THE government of Denmark had for years kept in
view the emancipation of the negro slaves, included within
its colonies of Santa Cruz, St. Thomas, and St. Johns. It
had afforded the means for a small amount of education
through the schools and churches under the care principally
of Moravian missionaries, and facilities through
which liberty could be bought by the more industrious
and enterprising blacks. It granted privileges by
which the free colored people became equal to the whites
in the eye of the law, and were allowed the same religious
advantages as themselves. Farther than that, the governor-general
encouraged social intercourse between them,
and by means of his occasional levees, strove to bring them
together as much as possible. This, of course, was dreadful
to the whites, and, if they dared, they would never
have returned an affirmative answer to the invitation to
honor themselves by their attendance upon him, their unpopular
governor.</p>

<p>"What do you intend to wear to the levee to-night?" said
Emma Stinson to Jane Rutgard.</p>

<p>"I have not thought much about it," said she, with a
toss of her head. "I had rather be put into the calaboose
than go there at all. I hate the governor, and despise all
his invitations," throwing his card across the room.</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 23 -->

<p>"Hush!" said her mother, who at that moment saw John,
one of the servants, slink out of a distant door of the long
apartment in which they were sitting. "Do be careful how
you speak thus within hearing of the people."</p>

<p>"I do not care, mamma, I am too indignant to keep my
speech within bounds. Here we are, forced to go whether
we will or no, to cringe and bow to this shameless man,
whose yellow mistress will be permitted to give herself
airs over us, and her vulgar relations will jostle us aside
to take the precedence as we walk to the supper-room. I
can't bear it," and Jane reddened with passion as she
gesticulated with great emphasis; "I have a great mind
to say, I will not go at any rate, and then tell him the
reason."</p>

<p>"And have your father civilly told that his services are
no longer needed by government&mdash;hey? My dear, you may
as well submit to these little unpleasantnesses," said the
indolent Mrs. Rutgard, leaning back in her arm-chair and
fanning herself. "It is not very often we are obliged to
endure it."</p>

<p>"Affairs are growing worse and worse," said Emma.
"Mamma says, that she verily believes, from all she has
heard, that the governor is plotting for the emancipation
of the slaves. Already they begin to grow insubordinate
and take airs upon themselves."</p>

<p>"They have never been as contented and obedient since
the law was made, that after twelve years, they should
have their freedom. Give them an inch and they will take
an ell," said Jane.</p>

<p>"I know that they are an ungrateful race," said Mrs.
Rutgard, with a little more energy than usual. "Though
I have been so indulgent to my servants, and they have
had so many favors, I dare say, that they would forget it
all in a moment, were there a prospect of their freedom
and leave me to take care of myself," and the poor lady
put her handkerchief to her eyes.</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 24 -->

<p>"There will be no safety for us, if there should be an
insurrection," said Miss Tomkins, an elderly maiden, in a
harsh, guttural tone. "They would take all our lives. I
would not trust one of them. Our safety rests upon their
being kept under strict rule. I wish we could have a different
governor-general from this present treacherous
one." These last words were spoken in a lowered tone,
lest the trade-wind, as it fanned their faces in their open
apartment, should waft the rebellious sentences to any one
of the many greedy Danish officials by whose exorbitant
salaries, among other means, the mother country impoverished
her colonies.</p>

<p>"O! I was so frightened, one night last week," said
Jane. "I was at 'Hannah's Rest' with Amelia. We sat
up pretty late chatting, and after I went to my room I could
not get to sleep. Her tea was so strong, I believe it
kept me awake, for I drank more than usual in the evening.
There I was lying alone, feeling a little nervous and
fidgetty when I heard a tap, tap, tap. I did not move at
first, though I trembled all over, but listened with my ears
wide open. By-and-by, tap, tap, tap again. I felt then
quite sure that it was a signal of the slaves who were
assembling for some mischief or other. I jumped up, determined
to do my part to put them down if I died in the
attempt, and lighted a lamp. I stood and listened, again
tap, tap, tap!"</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, what was it?" said Emma, wrought
up to great excitement by her graphic, earnest manner of
telling her story.</p>

<p>"I went to the window and looked all about, but could
see nothing by the pale moonlight, and everything seemed
still. I began to think it was my imagination, and I was
going to bed, when tap, tap, tap again!"</p>

<p>"O, gracious!" said Emma, clasping her hands, and
holding her breath.</p>

<p>"I could bear it no longer, so I went to brother Andrew's

<!--- vol 2 page 25 -->

door, and told him that there was a disturbance
among the negroes. He was out in quick time, as you
may suppose, with pistols in hand."</p>

<p>" 'Where? what?' said he, looking really pale with fright;
and as for Amelia, I thought she would go into fits. Her
scream, when I first told them, awakened the baby, who
began to cry at the top of his voice, so you may suppose,
what a bedlam there was."</p>

<p>"Go on, and tell us about the revolt," said Emma,
catching hold of Jane's arm, angry at her collateral details,
and her eyes staring with fear.</p>

<p>"Why, it was not a revolt, child," said she, alarmed
by her eager look. "I led Andrew into my room and told
him to stand still and listen. By-and-by, tap, tap again."</p>

<p>" 'You foolish child,' said he, partly relieved and partly
provoked, 'it is in your own closet.' He opened the door,
and away sprang a little mouse. My sister had set away
some guava jelly upon a salver, resting it upon two small
bandboxes. Mousey was attracted by the paste which was
used in covering it with paper, and in nibbling upon that,
moved the salver which was set unevenly upon the boxes,
and hence, the tap, tap, tap!"</p>

<p>"O, dear!" said Emma, "is that all? Next time you
relate an exciting story, tell how the end is to be, before
you begin. Why, you have scared me out of a year's
growth."</p>

<p>"We ought to be prepared for the worst," drawled Miss
Tomkins. "Emma," said she, to her niece, "put down
your window at night, won't you? There is no knowing
who may come about the house; the negroes are getting
very disorderly, I think."</p>

<p>"Why, Aunty, you know I should suffocate without air,
and it is at least twenty feet from the ground. But if you
think I ought to, I will."</p>

<p>This is but one instance of the continual apprehension
which haunts the slaveholder. No matter whether his fears

<!--- vol 2 page 26 -->

are well-grounded or not, they are the ghosts which injustice
and wrong conjure up, and no influence within the
limits of the terrible system, can allay them. They stalk
about, growing ever more grim, ghastly and threatening,
until the evil shall be repented of, and removed from the
land.</p>

<p>It was true that the slaves were getting more and more
dissatisfied with their condition, so one fine morning, instead
of going to work as usual, a troop of some thousands
of them assembled together from the plantations,
with their sharp, working implements in hand, and declared
themselves free. They shed no blood, and their depredations
upon property were comparatively small. Only a few
persons who had made themselves particularly obnoxious
to the blacks by cruel usage or provoking remarks at the
time, suffered from their retaliation. They even attempted
to allay the fears of the whites, as they marched through
the streets of Fredericstadt, where the rebellion first
began. To a lady, who gazed fearfully upon their movements
from her piazza as they passed along, a dark, tumultuous
crowd of excited human beings, they said; "<i>We
won't hurt you, Missis. We only want our freedom, and
freedom we will have!</i>" There must have been a general
concert among them, for, with some unimportant exceptions,
the insurrection was universal throughout the island,
Bassin, the eastern town, being only a very little later in
the same movement, than its sister town at the more western
point.</p>

<p>The white Creoles fled to the ships in the harbor, and
awaited the result. They sent immediately to Porto Rico
for assistance from its troops, as the Danish force on the
island was small and hesitating in its movements. Some
of the negroes came down to the shore and solicited the
return of the inhabitants to their homes, telling them that
they should be unharmed; but they were too much alarmed
to run the hazard. At Bassin the military fired a few times

<!--- vol 2 page 27 -->

into the rebel crowd, and some individuals were sacrificed,
one of which was a woman.</p>

<p>But the all-important point was gained. Freedom was
proclaimed by the governor-general, who all along had
been suspected of aiding and abetting them in their determination.
The government made arrangements by which
each troop of negroes should be required to remain for a
year in their former homes for small wages, and the island
settled down again into comparative quiet. It seemed to
be considered necessary to make an example of the leaders,
so that fifteen of them were, a few weeks afterwards,
shot in cold blood on the open square of the western town,
and a large number of others were condemned to the
chain-gang. These examples of cruelty and bloodshed
came with an ill grace from the whites, who had been
spared by the blacks in their day of power, not a blow
having been struck, nor a hair of their heads being injured
in the insurrection.</p>

<p>The Governor was recalled to Denmark in disgrace, and
another was appointed in his place. The Spanish troops
which were sent from Porto Rico returned home on the
arrival of the Danish reinforcements, and the turbulent
elements which had threatened to submerge this fair little
island in a sea of troubles, were to the casual observer
allayed by the prompt discipline and watchful oversight of
the mother country.</p>

<p>Mr. Carlan was one of the sufferers by the insurrection.
He was distasteful to the blacks, for his admixture of race
and his aspiring temper, which naturally led him away
from their fellowship. By the lower class of colored people
he was also disliked, because of his haughty reserve;
and among these were some of his distant relatives. He
had gone on, recklessly giving to one and another of them
of his means, without much sense of responsibility, deaf
to the suggestions of his wife, that he was really hindering
their rise in the scale of humanity by relieving them from

<!--- vol 2 page 28 -->

the exertion of their powers, which she plainly saw nothing
but absolute necessity would arouse.</p>

<p>At length his eyes were opened to the fact that, as their
demands were insatiable, it was of no use to attempt to
satisfy them, and that he must graduate his gifts by his
own sense of what was right under the circumstances,
leaving them to be pleased or discontented, as the case
might be. This aroused the anger of those whose assistance
from him was reduced; and low as they were in
spirit and character, they were angry with him for his
diminished help, rather than grateful for the generosity of
past years. Too late for his or their good he learned that,
in solving the difficult problem of how to benefit the less
favored classes, the first step is to accumulate as much
power of character as possible in ones-self, and while, at
the same time, that, from a broad outlook we take in their
general and particular wants, we must have an equal sense
of responsibility, firmness, and common sense in administering
to them as in guiding ourselves from the hurtful
effects of weakness, indolence, error, and guilt.</p>

<p>The mob, at the time of the insurrection, gathered around
Mr. Carlan's store and made some threatening demonstrations,
but were about leaving, when a free colored man, a
cousin of his, to whom he had refused money the day before,
called out, "Pitch into the upstart's goods! Let him
see what comes of looking down upon people!" They
obeyed, and his well-filled warehouse was soon a scene of
confusion and spoil.</p>

<p>His home, which was near, they did not molest. His
wife's gentle, affectionate heart and deportment were well
known, and in a moment after the deed was done, some of
the rioters repented on her account, and testified to its
truth by assisting in their leisure hours to repair the damage
committed and replace the articles saved from destruction
in their positions again.</p>

<p>The same group of white Creoles were sitting in the

<!--- vol 2 page 29 -->

cabin of the <i>Emily</i> a few days after comparative quiet had
been restored in the country, though they dared not yet
return to their homes.</p>

<p>"What a dreadful state of things for us!" said Mrs.
Rutgard. "It was as much as I could do before this rebellion
to manage my servants and make them do what I
required of them. But now that their heads are turned
by this foolish notion of freedom, matters will be a thousand
times worse. O dear, how ungrateful in them to
subject us to this, after all we have done for them!"</p>

<p>"I expected nothing better of Jim and Bill, for my part,"
said Jane; "and as for Susan, she has always been as impudent
as she could be to me. She will be giving herself
airs, I suppose, and tossing her head at me, (and Jane's
was in imminent danger of dislocation from a sudden jerk
upward,) I declare I want to leave the island forever.
Papa, let's go <i>home</i> and live."</p>

<p>Jane was born, bred, and educated in Santa Cruz. It
was her father and mother's birthplace too, though they
had been sent to England for a few years when young.
Her grandfather, it was true, was a native of that kingdom,
so, according to the custom of the islanders of considering
themselves as expatriated, the whole family called the
mother country home.</p>

<p>"I shall not have sufficient property left for that, my
dear," said Mr. Rutgard. "This cursed emancipation has
ruined us all. My estate would go for a mere song now.
Confound the government." (<i>Sotto voce.</i>)</p>

<p>This said estate had been impoverished by the ruinous
system of raising a succession of crops of the sugar-cane
for years, instead of relieving it by other productions; it
had never been generously enriched, and besides that, the
gentleman was convivial in his habits, extravagant in his
expenditures, and thriftless in the management of his
business every way, and yet emancipation was to bear all
the blame of his diminished means!</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 30 -->

<p>"Papa says that he thinks we may get along even better
than before," said Emma. "The negroes will be contented
with small wages, and will work all the better for
them. At any rate, he is going into the new system in good
earnest and try to have it work well."</p>

<p>"I don't want it to work well," said Mr. Rutgard. "And
if every planter would stand back, instead of making the
best of it, we might yet induce Denmark to give us back
old times again. Curse these new-fangled notions! The
slaves are not fit for freedom. They are an ignorant, degraded
set, and yet they are to be equal to us in the eye
of the law. What are we coming to? The impudence of
those colored rascals is insufferable. When we were conferring
with them on the day they came down to ask us to
return to the town, that scoundrel Bill had the impertinence
to nod to me with a twinkle in his eye, as if I were an
equal."</p>

<p>Emma turned away with an irresistible smile, for so
striking was the resemblance between the two, that among
both slaves and freemen of all colors he bore the sportive
appellation of Gen. Rutgard, Jr.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the languishing Mrs. Rutgard, who could be
pungent when occasion offered. "Our iniquities find us
out. These children of sin will, I verily believe, get final
possession of our beautiful island. <i>I</i> want no other home
to live and die in; but we may be forced from it," and she
fumbled in her pocket for her handkerchief, while her
husband wriggled on his chair.</p>

<p>"I know," said Emma, "there are some dear, good
creatures among them. When the first cry of insurrection
was raised, Mammy Otte turned pale&mdash;you need not laugh,
Jane&mdash;she did turn pale with fright, and wound her arms
around little Edwin and me, gasping out: 'They will kill
you, my children; let me hide my dear children from them!' "</p>

<p>"She always was a good soul," said Jane. "What a
difference there is in them!"</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 31 -->

<p>"And there never was a better fellow than Dick, our
coachman. Poor Dick! He slept in the window-seat one
night, with the full moon shining upon him, and that side
has been partially paralyzed ever since. Of course, he
could no longer be trusted with the horses, and he was <i>so</i>
fond of them and of all of us. Papa gave him his freedom,
but he is always lingering about the place. I never
can help saying, 'How sorry I am for you, Dick!' as he
touches his hat to me, and says, 'Your servant. Miss
Emma!' "</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Strophel, though panic-stricken like the
rest, suffered no other inconvenience from the new order
of things, than a residence of some days within the small
quarters of a crowded vessel, and after their return, from
some natural pertness and fain&eacute;ant tendencies of their
home servants. Being a pensioned officer of government,
he had no plantation to adjust in its workings to the new
order of things, so life soon went on with them very much
as before. Mr. Strophel had infirm health, and did no
business, and with a diminished income lived quietly, his
once handsome establishment bearing many marks of
neglect. His wife, from having but little opportunity to
indulge her passion for gayety, had settled down into a
managing housekeeper and scheming mother, gradually
taking, more and more, the rule of the household upon
her shoulders, as her husband's health declined till he was
fast becoming but little better than a supernumerary in the
establishment. She was looking forward to Hilda's return
with mingled curiosity and anxiety and a modicum of maternal
affection, it is true, but that had been insufficient to
abate her happiness very much by her more than twelve
years' separation from her. She would have been very
glad to have heard of her having matrimonial prospects in
Copenhagen, but as no such tidings came to her, she began
to cast about her for a suitable match within the island.</p>

<p>Delia, her youngest daughter, was but fourteen and

<!--- vol 2 page 32 -->

immature for her age, so she could, for the present,
concentrate her attention upon the older and marriageable
one.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carlan had for many months anticipated the insurrection.
With the quick insight of an awakened soul, she
had read the signs of the times, and knew that a change
was coming over the fortunes of her people. When in her
natural state, she seldom alluded to it, for her husband was
so accustomed to look on the dark side of things, that she
got but little sympathy if she indulged in any visions of a
better future. But when under the influence of somnambulism,
she would express herself in a more highly-wrought
style than was usual to her, and dwell with exultation upon
the emancipation of her race. With no literary culture,
associating only with minds of the simplest style of development,
whose speech and general subjects of conversation
were very circumscribed, she had, of course, but a
small storehouse of language to draw from, even in her
excited moods.</p>

<p>Clairvoyants in our own country, who have had but little
direct training, when in their abnormal condition, astonish
by their power of expression and capacity for giving
advice upon subjects foreign to their usual state of intelligence;
and they are supposed by many, to be under the influence,
involuntary to themselves, of disembodied spirits in
their revelations; but this seems inconsistent with reason
and nature, and derogatory to the dignity and independence
of the individual soul. If we valued that as we
ought, regarding it as an emanation from God, intrusted
to us to discipline, develop, and worthily prepare it by the
use of all the means he has imparted, to become one with
him in communion and aim and thus aid him in perfecting
the creation, already but begun as it were, we should
dread nothing so much as to give up our individual wills
and personal responsibility and become mere automata,
though even <i>glorified beings</i> might reveal themselves

<!--- vol 2 page 33 -->

through us. For nothing, in one sense, can be so great to
<i>us</i> as the nature which God has seen fit to originate for our
especial selves, and we turn aside from his evident design
if we are used by any external, created force in a way to
blend and confound us with the volition of another. It is
virtually saying that we are not satisfied with God's handiwork
in us, thereby proving ourselves ungrateful, undeveloped
and low in our conceptions of Him and of our
own souls. Aid, suggestion, encouragement, sympathy we
can gather from each other, and thus unite ourselves in
loving fellowship with the great and pure spirits of all past
and present time. It is good to associate with our fellows
in the various enterprises, instituted for the elevation of
mankind. But while yielding to others their meed of influence
and opportunity to develop each one his peculiar
genius and distinct characteristics, we must guard with
delicate care against the absorption of ourselves in the
general mass, or give up the particular qualities, tastes,
and tendencies which go to make up the individual <i>me</i>.
For we may be sure that, if the Infinite took pains to
fashion our being and breathe into it his pure breath of
life, he wishes, not only on our account, but for His good
pleasure also, to have us bloom into the proportions which
will make us a beautiful, new variety in his garden of exotics,
rather than to shape ourselves into one general conglomerate
without definite beauty of form, loveliness of
hue, or distinction of fragrance. This answers the idea
which is so widely spread, that spirits speak through mediums
without their voluntary will. Are not they, as well as
we, creatures of God? therefore should they not be suffered
to tyrannize over us, any more than those clothed
with humanity. No, it is time to understand that we
belong to the great Father, not to each other in any servile
or arbitrary sense. To him we are to look for our highest
communion; his universal spirit influences without enslaving;
his enlightening voice speaks, when we will let it,

<!--- vol 2 page 34 -->

into our inmost souls, and in proportion as they are prepared
for its incoming, does it echo it in more forcible or
feebler modulations. Even God has a tender respect for
our individuality, working with us for our regeneration,
instead of compelling us to obedience. Therefore, when
men and women speak with unwonted, and, as it seems to
many, with supernatural power in these days, it is a proof
of a soul awakened either by normal or unnatural means,
and that it has unwonted glimpses of truth either through
some crevice caused by disease, which is working in this
preternatural way, or as a natural result of the just and
conscientious use of means to exalt the spirit, character,
and life.</p>

<p>The ignorant may thus, in exceptional instances, utter
wonderful verities in elevated language, just as in excited
moments the arm may break through a stone wall, or lift
immense weights. In this country of books many facts
may have been gathered from them to be made use of in
this time of excitement, to give utterance to their unwonted
contemplations. For it must be remembered that nothing
is lost from the soul, but each casual word which it takes
in, even when listening carelessly in some occupied hour,
falls upon its soft tablets, making an impression, which,
though it may be overgrown, is never eradicated and is to
start up in some future day, either to rejoice and exalt, or
to condemn and disgrace us, according to its character,
and the spirit with which it was received. We believe
this doctrine to be true of the future world. What proof
have we that the spiritual faculties may not be so awakened
in this life as to live through the same experience, not
alone in occasional and startling exceptions, but more
according to the rule of an age, quickened, as no past
time has been, by the thousand new agencies put into motion
for its advancement? When human nature, in the
material departments of life, has taken such an unprecedented
start, it is no better than infidelity to suppose that

<!--- vol 2 page 35 -->

the spiritual life of humanity is always to remain in a state
so disproportional to it as it now is, in the high places of
power, influence, and trust, no less than among the masses
of mankind. The universe is one. All spirits are emanations
from one parent source. It may be that an intimate
sympathy may exist between those of different, outward
spheres, through the subtle and potent power of spiritual
affinity; but that is a secondary consideration. The
supreme, indispensable one is, that we become one with
the Father through the means taught and exemplified by
Jesus, the great head of a new spiritual creation, the Inspirer
and leader in the career of the boundless development
of the soul.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carlan's mind was filled with the poetry, imagery,
and rapt prophecies of the Bible, which principally made
up the sum of her literature and classical power of expression,
so that when somnambulic, she would express herself
similarly to them, and quote them in apt illustration of the
truths she uttered. She would exclaim, with clasped
hands and streaming eyes, "O! that the salvation of my
people would come out of Zion!" Then her face would
brighten as she would exultingly go on, "When God
bringeth back the captivity of his people, all the righteous
shall rejoice, and they who love the Lord shall be glad.
Yea, they who were down-trodden shall build the waste
cities and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and
drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens and
eat the fruit of them."</p>

<p>Thus prepared by her observation and foresight for the
exciting scene of the insurrection, she was not only calm
herself but went from one family to another, both of the
free and enslaved, counseling moderation and self restraint,
at the same time that she sympathized with, cheered, and
encouraged them in the step they were taking.</p>

<p>As she recovered her health, and the time drew near for
Zo&euml;'s return, the thought of which gave new life to her

<!--- vol 2 page 36 -->

being, she lost, in a measure, the morbid expression of her
intensified nature, though she felt it had taken an onward
spring which gave new richness and significance to her
life. She still employed the language of Scripture to aid
her in the expression of her awakened feelings; but she
was gradually losing all tendency to somnambulism, which
was a great relief and cause of rejoicing to her husband.
With her present state of mind he had but little sympathy,
and thought her very fanatical and far removed from common
sense and a sound judgment.</p>

<p>Though unable to write very freely to Zo&euml; from her
defective penmanship, she had not lacked means of communication,
or remained a stranger to her child. For
when, through her simple letters, she failed to express
fully her affection, she gathered and sent with them
the various beautiful shells from the sea beach, each one
of which became a symbol of the "mysterious union"
between them. She strung the brilliant Jumba and Cocrico
beans, for bracelets for her darling, and occupied many a
leisure hour in weaving various pretty useful articles, of
the rich, shining chestnut-colored seeds of the wild tamarind.
She at first pressed the flowers of the island, but
finding they lost their hues by the process, she brought
them home, and taught herself to copy them in water-colors
in beautiful arrangement, so that Zo&euml;'s volume of
West Indian wild flowers was the admiration of her
friends.</p>

<p>The sea-weeds and mosses she rescued from the
waves, and their pencil-lines and bright variegated tints,
were a proof to her child as much of her unseen mother's
love, as that down deep in the sea, where no one is near
to note God's admirable working, he lavishes his skill in
the pure spirit of beauty upon these waifs from the lower
ocean-depths, no less than upon the gorgeous flowers born
of the sunlight and soil.</p>

<p>Before the insurrection, Mr. Carlan had determined to

<!--- vol 2 page 37 -->

send for Zo&euml;; but that event occurring a little previous to
the time when Captain Keiser, an acquaintance of his,
would leave Denmark, he thought it better that she should
remain until matters were more settled, as there was yet
great uncertainty felt concerning the workings of the new
system. We have already seen how Zo&euml; decided otherwise.
There was no time, of course, for her to forewarn
her parents of the step she had taken, so that she was fast
nearing them on her homeward way, while they thought
her still in the safety and quiet of her school-retreat.</p>

<p>ONCE on board and Copenhagen fading into the dim
distance, the excitement of preparation and departure from
Miss Ingemann and her friends over, Zo&euml; sank into one
of the terrible fits of depression to which she had always
been liable, but which, as she grew older, deepened and
lengthened in their character and duration. She threw
herself upon her bed in her state-room, not to weep, for
the bitter grief which weighed her down was beyond all
reach of tears, but to live over her whole life again and
question herself of its history in the past and its destiny
for the future. To the keenly sensitive spirit no great
change can take place in its environments without a corresponding
one in its physical and psychological life. It
dies, as it were, to one great experience before it awakens
to another. Zo&euml; felt this truth in its full force. Prostrated
in body, deeply despondent in mind, her world seemed
coming to an end, and had the crack of doom sounded in
her ear from without, summoning her to judgment, it
would, at that moment, have appeared to her as in the
natural course of events; for with her, as with all persons
who live much within themselves and in the spirit of
Nature, the two seemed indissolubly connected. She
looked back to her infancy, even to the third year, for her
memory served her thus well, and took in each stage of the
wonderful journey of human existence. Glimpses of the

<!--- vol 2 page 39 -->

loving tenderness with which her first years were nurtured,
and of being led by her mother through a paradise of verdure,
laved by the many-tinted sea of the tropics, came
out, one by one, from the daguerreotype within her. But
over even that sunny period of childhood there was a shadow.
Her father's grave face looked darkly upon her from
the background. Her mother's, sweetly pensive, smiled
with tears in her eyes as she gazed upon her child, and
listened with attention to the troubled words of her husband.
Of the latter she had lost the memory even, if she
had ever understood them, and yet their spirit and those
sad looks of her parents had, somehow, woven a dark
thread into the fabric of her soul. She recalled the parting
from them, the life on board ship, with its wonderful
sights and still more wondrous legends of the helmsman.
Her distaste for some of the duties of her school, her fears
of her teacher, and yet her constant sense of her intended
kindness, were a mystery, a trouble, and a reproach to her.
She recalled the sweet intervals of country life, when Miss
Ingemann would take her pupils to the hillsides for a few
summer days each year, when she would talk with the white
elves in sisterly terms of endearment, and try to propitiate
the good-will of the dark elves, and encourage the little Hill-f&ocirc;k
with her own confident hope of their eventual welcome
to Heaven. She sported with the lambs and calves, with the
full belief that, imprisoned within them was some poor little
boy or girl, who one day would reveal to her the story of their
dumb imprisonment. Each tree, leaf, and flower were to
her sentient existences. She sought for the particular one
in which she had once been enshrined, but found it not in
the cold climate of the north, for the mimosa thrives only
where a southern sun and gales open and close it gently
by their soft morning and evening breath. The sea, in
the July days, would waft her spirit on its sparkling, fluent
waves to her southern home; but in winter, when the cold
snow would mingle with and whiten its waters, and the

<!--- vol 2 page 40 -->

icebergs would float by in chilly and glittering majesty, she
would close her eyes and wrap her mantle about her bosom
that the image of her own blue Caribbean might not be
swept away by its rude whirlwinds. She thought of the
good captain and his dying wife, and how, when the news
came to her of the death of the latter, in a few months after
their landing, a tie seemed severed between her and the
home from which she had attended her. She recalled how
she had gladly welcomed her little daughters, Freya and
Adelgunda, that through their love and companionship,
she might renew the severed bond, and how faithfully they
had ever kept the promise made to their mother, to love
the little stranger. Her after friendship with Mrs. Liebenhoff,
the Sunday instructions of her pastor, the thousand
opportunities for culture of mind and character which had
been hers in the home she was leaving, all came up vividly
to her mind's eye, forcing her to pass judgment upon the
profit she had derived from them.</p>

<p>Like all idealists, Zo&euml; lived as it were two lives. In
her usual one, she was the reformer, devoted by Heaven,
to a great ministry. For this she had been involuntarily
preparing herself, by her intimacy with Nature and the
Word of God. The training of her school, and her general
literary culture were of a character to foster and help her
on to the fulfillment of this settled instinct, first; then, idea
of her mind. Everything which she gained, in accordance
with her taste, was absorbed into her being, enriching
and exalting it, and hastening its maturity. From history,
she learned the economy of God's providence, and
the philosophy of mankind's existence and growth. From
poetry, she exhaled the subtle essence to be intensified in
her own spirit. In romances and biographies, she was
brought into sympathy with human character and life,
while they gave her hints in the mastery of a knowledge
of herself. She seized hold of the most striking facts of
the natural sciences to prove the truth of her feeling that

<!--- vol 2 page 41 -->

the universe was one in plan, tendency, sympathy, and
progression. By the separate beauties they revealed,
which responded to the truth of her own observations, was
she lifted higher and higher into the regions of the poetic,
so that more and more did she grow into the world of idealism,
while less and less was she fitted to cope with the actual.
For, though burning with a love of humanity, and
panting to save it, living as she had, in almost cloister retirement,
when brought into contact with the world, she
was ill at ease, unhappy and bewildered. No one came
within reach of her ideal of perfection, and yet, so much
better could the practical and common-place do well their
part in life, adorn society and be happy in it than herself,
that she was miserable at the thought of her own deficiencies,
and abashed before the superiority of the world.
Then would the thought be forced upon her, that, though
indulging daily in visions of the extensive use of every faculty
intrusted to her, she was in reality in the rear in this
respect, of the most worldly and least gifted. So overborne
was she at times, by reflections like these, exaggerated
as her sentiments were, by a somewhat morbid development
of body as well as mind, accompanied by a
reserve which had become a second nature to her, that
her occasional fits of despondency were dreadful, though
her passive features and quiet manner revealed it but little
to others.</p>

<p>Hilda knew her much better than any one else, and
without prying into her confidence or directly attempting
to console her, had great power over her feelings, by her
sunny temperament and never failing affection. She saw
Zo&euml;'s depression and hastened to her relief.</p>

<p>It was curious to see the utter difference of their feelings
at this time towards Miss Ingemann. Hilda was that
lady's favorite of all the girls in the school. She alone, of
the number, was on terms of familiarity with her. Her
playfulness and na&iuml;vet&eacute; amused her, and her courage,

<!--- vol 2 page 42 -->

decision and energy called forth her approval. Through
these qualities, she had carried herself, as if by storm,
into a kind of companionship with her dignified teacher,
which was a separate cause of wonder to both of them.
But the younger and more impressible nature had been
very much modified by the refined, tender, long-suffering,
poetic Zo&euml;. She had learned somewhat her mode of psychological
outlook, and her opinions were becoming more
and more shaped to an accordance with hers. She, therefore,
year by year, regarded the style of development, of
which Miss Ingemann was a most favorable type, with distrust
and lessened admiration, and the last few days,
though they had made her tremble more than ever for Zo&euml;,
had convinced her of the inferiority of Miss Ingemann in
all that pertains to the spiritual grace and elevation of
womanhood. Lacking Zo&euml;'s comprehensive, Christian
sentiment of fraternity, charity and all-sided consideration,
in judging of character, the more she saw her friend suffering
and despondent, the more did her affection for Miss
Ingemann diminish for the time being, until indignation at
Zo&euml;'s wrongs and indifference, and even aversion towards
the cause of them were her prominent sentiments.</p>

<p>"Come on deck with me, Zo&euml;," said Hilda, as she
opened the door of her state-room, "and let us take our
last look of Copenhagen. There is a beautiful sunset and
a new moon, too. I saw it over my right shoulder; so you
see that everything is propitious for our voyage."</p>

<p>"Not now, dear," said Zo&euml;; "you may go and leave me
here for the present. My head aches."</p>

<p>Hilda saw how it was with her, and hesitated whether
she should speak to her of her sadness or leave her to herself,
as Zo&euml; usually preferred when her tone of spirits was
at the very lowest ebb; but as they were all in all to each
other now, away from other friends as they were, she was
compelled to a different course.</p>

<p>"Zo&euml;, love," said she, "what troubles you so <i>very</i> much?

<!--- vol 2 page 43 -->

I know it is sad parting from them all; but then, you know,
we love each other better than we do all the rest of them
put together, so we will be happy, nevertheless, will we
not?"</p>

<p>"Dear Hilda, you will always be happy; but I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you, too, because you know you live in the seventh
heaven where the sun shines all the time, only tempered
a little by those white, throne-like clouds you like so well.
I only manage to <i>exist</i> while you <i>live</i>, my seraphina, pure
as ether!"</p>

<p>"Don't say so, Hilda. I am all wrong, wrong." And
she turned her head away from her.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me that, or I shall grow dangerous, who
know well enough where all the wrong lies. But we are
away now, thank heaven. Humph!"</p>

<p>"O! I owe so much to Miss Ingemann," said Zo&euml;, "and I
have always troubled her so."</p>

<p>"<i>O! I owe</i>, is a very pretty play upon words, but I am
not disposed, in my present state of mind, to go any farther
into their meaning, unless it be in a very unchristian direction,
which I know will not please you, so we will drop this
dreadful debt which seems to weigh upon you, into the sea,
while we, in the meantime, go down to tea."</p>

<p>"I don't wish for any tea to-night. I had rather stay
here."</p>

<p>"Come, life," said Hilda, without heeding her answer,
"I will introduce you to the captain. I have already
commenced a most sentimental friendship with him. I
was rushing along the passage at the rate of ten knots the
hour, (you see I am a sailor already) when I ran against
him as he came out of his state-room, with such force that
he involuntarily put his arm around me to save himself
from falling. Of course I was dreadfully embarrassed,
and knew not what to do at first; but I caught the twinkle
of his roguish eye, so what did we do but laugh outright
in each other's faces. It was as good as a month's ordinary

<!--- vol 2 page 44 -->

acquaintance and you shall share the benefit of it with
me. Come, again I say; we will seat ourselves by him at
table, you on one side and I on the other, and thus command
the best of everything going."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; smiled and said, "not to-night," and relapsed again
into abstraction and sadness.</p>

<p>Hilda could be serious and was very sensible too.</p>

<p>"Zo&euml;," said she, "I really think you ought to try and
overcome these unhappy feelings. You seem to me to
indulge in them more and more, and it is very bad for you
every way. Come, cheer up, will you not for my sake?"</p>

<p>Zo&euml; began to rise.</p>

<p>"If you do not, I shall begin to think that parting with
Ben Ezra has something to do with this forlorn mood of
yours."</p>

<p>Here she showed her want of a delicate sympathy in
the means she took in rousing her friend. If she thought
so, it was the last remark possible she ought to have made,
and if she did not think so, she should have known that so
abrupt a reference to it as that, to an enthusiastic nature
like Zo&euml;'s, who disliked nothing so much as the common
trifling upon one of the most sacred subjects of life, was a
sad mistake in her present nervous state.</p>

<p>She sank back again on her couch sayings "Hilda, please
never, <i>never</i> mention his name to me."</p>

<p>Hilda opened her eyes wide for her own relief and edification,
out of sight of Zo&euml;, wondering if there had been
any <i>passages</i> between them, concluded upon the whole
there had been, and went down to the dining-saloon, saying
to herself, "O dear, dear, here is new trouble in the
wind! How am I ever to get this gossamer web, woven of
spirit and nerves, with any kind of safety, through this
rough, wicked world! Even knowing how tender its
meshes are, as I do, don't save me from making a rent in
it now and then. How much more will the selfish and
coarse, who think it is compounded of nothing but common

<!--- vol 2 page 45 -->

materials!" And she drew a long sigh, as she seated herself
by the captain.</p>

<p>Zo&euml;, left alone, recurred to the parting scene between
herself and Ben Ezra, not without self-reproach at her
abrupt and indignant reception of words, which he was
guiltless of supposing would thus anger and wound her.</p>

<p>"I am bewildered and distressed," she said to herself,
"Is it not a vain fancy that I have been indulging, that I
am to reject the dearest happiness of life through the martyr-spirit,
prompting me to give up everything for the
cause of Christ and God? Have I not been negligent in
reading aright the intimations of Providence, which, perhaps,
pointed to the very consummation he wished? Now
I remember how, from the first, his words seemed to me
as the inspiration of God; how, as he recounted his experience
through one age after another, my spirit reveled in
the freedom it so much pants after, and soared in companionship
to the heaven of heavens.</p>

<p>"Let me bethink myself. The first night of our meeting
there was a strange and startling conjunction of the new
moon and the star of love. Since, this lunar complement
of my soul has shown even more than her wonted
sympathy with my every phase of feeling. When I was
happy, the effulgence of her rays gave still richer tone and
gladness to my spirit. When I have been sad, clouds more
or less dark and dense have vailed her mild face from
mine, telling of her sorrow for my grief. And later still,
the planet Jupiter has come within our orbit with unwonted
brilliancy, he and the love-planet on opposite sides of
heaven, looking into each other's eyes with strange intelligence.
But ah me! last night I looked for my beloved
queen, Venus, the shadow-attended star of evening, and
lo! it had fled from heaven, hiding her face in anger and
shame, at the dull comprehension of her favored votary.
O sad, sad willfulness of my untutored spirit, thus to thrust
aside what God intended for my bliss and highest good,

<!--- vol 2 page 46 -->

and through me the fulfillment of his promises to men! O
miserable me! Blind, presumptuous me! who have called
myself great Nature's fondling and God's prophetess of
the coming dispensation. How could I be thus perverse?
Am I not all wrong, a poor, weak idiot and fanatic, false
to truth and duty, and condemned to punishment for my
soaring fancies, of which this dark pall, hanging low and
dense over my spirits, is but the prognostic and preparation?
O help me, God, forgive, enlighten, point me to the
path where I must walk, to the work appointed me by
Thee!"</p>

<p>Thus was Zo&euml; ever questioning with herself, and in this
experience with the mysterious stranger was opened upon
her a new world of anxiety and doubt. In any other young
girl it would have been simply disappointed love, which
threw her whole being into commotion. Ruled, however,
first of all by the great idea of self-consecration to a religious
reform, she was not liable to yield up her affections
hastily. On the contrary, as has been said, her feeling
<i>had</i> been that she should never marry. But in reviewing
the past, it seemed now that she had made a mistake, both
as it regarded herself and also the furtherance of her
mission. As a woman, she felt that she had thrust from
her recklessly a whole constellation of enlightenment and
joy; a sun in his clear intellect, which would ever guide
her onward in her search, after truth; a gentle moon, shining
upon her with benignant, loving light at the same time
that there were depths in his being like the fathomless
gorges of that planet, satisfying to her thirst after the mysterious
and indefinite. He was Jupiter in his power, and
strength, and capacity of a glorious, protecting affection.
He was Saturn, into whose ocean-like depths of soul she
could pour the rivers of her own pent-up being, and find
relief, and at the same time receive fullness in return.
And in his steady revolution through the ages, while governed
by the natural laws which kept him within the

<!--- vol 2 page 47 -->

earth's orbit of duty, sympathy, and its highest means of
cultivation, he was at the same time, ever like our system
of worlds, revolving nearer and nearer towards the great
clustered suns of the universe.</p>

<p>As a reformer, she had perhaps thrown away half her
own power by what seemed to her now her own self-absorption,
and she mourned over a mistake which might
condemn multitudes to partial blindness and death. Thus
she mused in bitterness and doubt until sleep, the refreshment
of weary, troubled mortals, wafted her gently into the
regions of harmony and peace, and attuned her soul to
devotion and trust, as in the morning she awoke to see
the sun springing out of the ocean-bed, and by its ascending
rays, scattering golden colors over the wave-crests,
like bright-eyed hopes, ever rising and falling, yet ever
renewing, till embraced by, and blended with the sea of
infinitude.</p>

<p>When Hilda came into her state-room after she had
risen, she found her quite cheerful and ready to listen to
the various incidents which she had already a store of, and
to go with her into the cabin and join in whatever there
was of interest and novelty within the compass of the
sailing vessel. Their voyage was a successful one. Mr.
Sarran was all devotion and gallantry to his young lady
charges, the captain was a frank, agreeable Danish gentleman,
who made them feel at home on board his well-ordered
ship, so that at the end of a few days when they were fast
nearing London, the pleasure and excitement of the scene
before them were allayed by regret at bidding good-by to
their hospitable, ocean-host.</p>

<p>Hilda knew the exact locality of her relatives, so that the
two friends were soon welcomed in true English style and
made amply comfortable, and soon happy among the kindred
of her mother, in the very centre of the world-renowned
city of London.</p>

<p>Mr. Sarran established himself in a hotel near, and

<!--- vol 2 page 48 -->

divided his time between the accomplishment of his business
and attending them to some of the principal objects
of interest in the city. He was a man of dispatch, and
told them that in one week, he should be ready to go on
board the steamship Forth, and sail its usual route, first to
Bermuda, touch at the Bahama islands, then on to Mobile,
in Alabama, U. S., from thence to Havana and Jamaica,
passing by Porto Rico, and so on to St. Thomas and Santa
Cruz. Zo&euml; thought it a circuitous route home, but Hilda
rejoiced in it, and reminded her that, as they had intrusted
themselves to the Viking, there was no knowing when they
might heave in sight of their island. For her part, she
should like well to make a voyage of discovery, so she
should encourage Mr. Sarran's sailing propensities as
much as possible, as she never expected to have another
opportunity of seeing the world, which, so far, she had
found quite to her liking.</p>

<p>One day they went to Westminster Abbey, and spent an
hour amidst its aisles and in its poets' corner. To Zo&euml;
this temple spoke impressively of the past by its architecture
and the monuments to its distinguished dead. She
bowed reverently to the genius which had fashioned each
architrave and pillar to the spirit of a past religion, whose
venerable breath still whispered through its cloistered
alcoves. When the organ swelled forth its world of solemn,
low-toned music, the roar of the ocean and the vast forests
seemed hushed in concord with her soul, that no possible
discord might interrupt its harmonies. And when it pealed
forth its chorus, with the vocal choir as an accompaniment,
O! then her spirit was swept upon its wings of wondrous
melody to an ideal region, where the joyous morning song
of birds, the rich, blended sound of myriads of insects,
rejoicing in their summer life, the hallelujahs of a nation's
joyful p&aelig;ans, ay, and the music of the spheres seemed
combined to constitute its majesty. Still Zo&euml; lived too
much in the future to blend her feelings permanently with

<!--- vol 2 page 49 -->

the genius of the pile. For to her vision, the simple, joyful
faith of Jesus clothed itself, it is true, with the pointing,
uplifting form of the Gothic architecture in its exterior
development, but within, in a cheerful, domestic, home-like
church in which God and man could meet in natural,
unforced communion, together with Jesus and the great
and good of all past and present time, with the light of
heaven shining through to brighten, warm, and animate the
scene.</p>

<p>As they returned home through Hyde Park, the word
was given out by the coachman that the Queen was coming.
He drew the horses aside, to be out of the way and
at the same time to give the party a good view of the
pageant. The train came grandly on, horses, and carriages,
and outriders, with her majesty in one of them with
Prince Albert, the Princess Royal, and a youth, whom
their friends said was the Prince of Portugal. The Queen
bowed to the assembled crowd as she rode by, the glittering
train passed on, and Zo&euml; and Hilda with their friends
returned on their homeward way.</p>

<p>The two girls were alone in their room.</p>

<p>"How splendid the Queen's cort&egrave;ge was! What a magnificent
equipage, and with what pomp the whole train
moved along! You cannot deny, Zo&euml;, that there is something
very imposing in royalty, although you have fallen in
love so with republics! Confess, now, that you were impressed
by it."</p>

<p>"Certainly I was, I have an eye for splendor and beauty
of arrangement, no less than you, provided it is no more than
proportionate to what is much grander."</p>

<p>"You mean, of course, the souls of these great people.
Well, I don't know how it will do to look as deeply as that
in judging of the show. But at any rate, as a woman and
a mother, you cannot but respect Queen Victoria."</p>

<p>"Most assuredly. She dares to live a much more natural
and human life than any of her predecessors, and for

<!--- vol 2 page 50 -->

that I am very glad, and feel that I could really love
her."</p>

<p>"I know I should like to be in her place. Now don't
shake your head in that fashion; I mean for a little while,
at least. The fact is, I do like to rule. I always did, and
I believe I always shall."</p>

<p>"Then you had better not wish to be Queen Victoria.
Poor lady, poor, poor lady!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean? She does not want you to pity
her. Is she not queen of the greatest and most powerful
kingdom on the globe, the one which takes the first rank
in the civilization of the day? I glory in the idea that a
woman can be thus exalted. You see that I can talk in
Mrs. Liebenhoff-style, as well as you."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Liebenhoff would not glory in Queen Victoria's
position, Hilda, far from it. What is it but one of wretched
helplessness? Nominally a sovereign, really but an instrument
in the hands of her ministers and aristocracy, compelled
to make war through the force of a miserable,
wicked, and barbarous usage, to hear of the slaughter of
thousands of the best and bravest of her subjects, with no
power to save them, while she is insulted by having it
sounded through the world, that she shows her sympathy
for their woes by <i>hemming pocket-handkerchiefs for them!</i>
Think you if she, a <i>woman</i>, had the power you ascribe to
her, there would be the sufferings there are in her ill-furnished
camp, in which cold, pestilence, and famine are
slaying even more than the siege and battle? And now,
what a rejoicing at the victory in which thirty thousand
Christian Europeans have been murdered for the quarrel
of a few crowned heads! And she, a <i>woman</i>, forced to
congratulate the people for what sends them into mourning
and sadness forever! O Hilda, Hilda! rather than stand
in her proud place, and sweep through the streets in regal
splendor, while deeds like these are mingled with her
name and crying aloud for redress and retribution, her

<!--- vol 2 page 51 -->

hands meanwhile bound as with chains, and her heart
crushed down by pagan codes and worldly forms and customs,
I would put on the rudest peasant garb and walk by
night and day to their relief, and say to the poor, maimed,
and dying soldiers: 'See, I, your queen, could not abate
the cruelty of the men ruling the councils of our nation,
so I have come to bind up your wounds, to bathe your
burning, blood-stained brows, and die with you, if God
wills&mdash;it matters not&mdash;here I lose but one life, but away
from you, on England's throne, I groan out a martyr's death
each moment in thinking of your wrongs and woes!' "</p>

<p>"But, Zo&euml;, she does not look at the matter as you do.
She sees more of the glory of victory than the sufferings
of the people. I own I used to, and thought formerly I
should like to marry a great general like Napoleon, for
instance, and go with him to his campaigns; but, really,
since this disgraceful siege of Sevastopol, begun without
enthusiasm, and continued without any spontaneous heroism,
has been on the tapis, I must say I have got to hate
and despise war nearly as much as you."</p>

<p>"O! it is horrible. I wonder why it never comes into
the minds of any queen or king to be a great, spiritual
sovereign like our Saviour, and so rule the ages as he does
and ever will?"</p>

<p>"But, you know, he was different from other beings,
Zo&euml;. Nobody can be like him, only in a very distant
way."</p>

<p>"I know he was greater and better than any one that
will be on the earth again, because he lived in an age of
the world when there were more obstacles to his leading a
life of perfect holiness than now, and yet he attained to
that elevation, and endured more suffering and persecution
from carrying out his heavenly principles than any other
one; for sinless as he knew himself to be, yet he submitted
manfully to the direst death that can be conceived of.
Therefore he is our Leader, now and forevermore. But if

<!--- vol 2 page 52 -->

he did not know that, in our different spheres, we could do
as he did in his, ay, even more in proportion to the increased
materials we have to work with, and the prepared
state of the mind of the world by the prevalence of his
religion, why did he say,  'greater works than these ye
shall do, because I go unto my Father?' "</p>

<p>"Well, Zo&euml;, I don't know about it; but I think it is not
right, dear, for us to talk so about these high matters. We
are young and must be guided by other people's opinions.
Miss Ingemann did not think as you do, I am sure. Let's
go down into the drawing-room." And she put her arm
around Zo&euml; and drew her out of the room, chatting merrily
upon other subjects as she went down the stairs.</p>

<p>It had become her custom, and more than ever now, that
she was left alone with her, thus to draw her away from
herself, as it were, fearing that she was getting into danger
through fanaticism. Zo&euml; appreciated her tender solicitude,
which it needed no words to understand, and in one sense,
felt strengthened by the supervision of Hilda's more practical
and common style of character and thought. On the
other, she constantly suffered from having her strongest
feelings thrown back upon herself, and her nature grew in
intensity and fervor in proportion as it was denied all free
expression.</p>

<p>WHEN the week was ended, and Mr. Sarran's business
accomplished, he was impatient to be on the wing
again. They, therefore, went on board the Forth, one of
the large steam vessels, which now plyed between England
and the West Indies, touching the United States on its
way.</p>

<p>They bade an affectionate farewell to Hilda's relatives,
who had administered, in such kindly manner, to their
comfort and pleasure, and the girls, to their delight, found
themselves established one fine day, just before evening,
in their spacious and comfortable state-rooms. In this
respect the ship compensated pretty well for its ordinary
ladies' saloon, situated at the stern of the vessel, whose
motion at that point was particularly favorable to sea-sickness,
while the accommodations for those who might thus
suffer, were meagre in quantity and style. During their
rather tempestuous voyage they kept in them principally,
well ventilated as they were, until one morning the cry on
board was&mdash;"land ahead!"&mdash;and the island of Bermuda
was visibly rising from the sea as they gazed.</p>

<p>Hilda had recovered from her qualmishness and was

<!--- vol 2 page 54 -->

on deck in fine spirits, watching every indication of this
solitary group of islands, which are more isolated than any
other point of land except St. Helena, on the globe.</p>

<p>As they approached it the colored pilot came on board,
and he, with the captain, were continually on the outlook,
for the approach is a very hazardous one on account of the
coral reefs which lie under the water. For they change
so by constant growth that the greatest care is necessary
else the ship is injured by contact with their sharp branches.
The rules of the British service are very strict, so that the
captain took especial care to prevent it, lest he should
lose his command, that being the penalty for any severe
abrasion.</p>

<p>Hilda stood by an English gentleman, by the name of
Dennis, with whom she had become somewhat acquainted.
As they neared the island of <i>Ireland</i>, their point of destination,
she said:</p>

<p>"What a pretty contrast there is between the deep verdure
and the glistening white buildings."</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, "the island looks like a nice little dish
of spinach and eggs."</p>

<p>Hilda laughed.</p>

<p>"What are those houses with immense sloping roofs
here and there?" said she.</p>

<p>"They are for the purpose of collecting the rain which
falls and conducting it to reservoirs, otherwise the residents
would suffer inconvenience for the want of good water;
that which is in the wells is very much impregnated with
lime."</p>

<p>"What are those miserable-looking old ships in the
harbor?"</p>

<p>"They are hulks of vessels, used as prisons for convicts.
John Mitchell, the Irish rebel, is now confined there."</p>

<p>Here there was a perceptible shock given to the steamship
by its grazing against a hidden coral-reef. The captain
moved about from one point to another, looking very

<!--- vol 2 page 55 -->

much disturbed, and spoke with great severity to the pilot,
to whose want of skill, he attributed the accident. Whether
all the blame rested on him or not, became a subject of
discussion among the gentlemen passengers. Was the
ship given entirely into his care, or, as the captain was on
the outlook, was not he partly responsible? All agreed,
however, that notwithstanding the buoys swung here and
there, at the entrance of the harbor, to warn pilots of the
most dangerous reefs; yet, from the constant working of
myriads of sea-insects, it must always be a very difficult
one to enter. Great sympathy was felt for Capt. Stedman,
and a certificate was signed by the passengers, attesting to
his care and faithfulness, in order to avert, if possible, the
penalty attending any accident to one of the ships of the
Royal Mail Steam Packet Company.</p>

<p>Hilda kept Zo&euml; informed of everything passing on deck,
while she was detained a prisoner upon her couch by the
languor produced by sea-sickness. As the ship slowly
neared its haven, its lessened motion gave her some relief.
She rose and sat upon her berth to look out of her port-hole,
and was delighted with the variegated tints of green,
violet and purple, which the ocean strangely reflects upon
its bosom. And now, that all was still within the huge
leviathan, of whom she felt she was a part, so sympathetic
was she with its every breath and motion, she arose, and
with the aid of Hilda's stronger arm and steadier frame,
arrayed herself to go on deck.</p>

<p>At that moment, there were steps in the passage, and a
knock at the door. Hilda opened it, and two young women
stood at the entrance with large bundles in their
hands. One was a Quadroon, the other, a full Negress.</p>

<p>"Any soiled clothes to be washed. Missis?" said the
elder and prettier of the two.</p>

<p>"No," said Hilda. "I have already given them to some
one," and was about to close the door.</p>

<p>"Stop, Hilda," said Zo&euml;.</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 56 -->

<p>Emboldened by this request, the young woman advanced
a step, taking some lemons from a basket on her arm, and
saying to Zo&euml;, "will Missis have some?"</p>

<p>"O! it is just what you were wishing for, is it not,
some good, sour lemons to give you an appetite?" said
Hilda. "And here are some green ones, the first I ever
saw. Let me pay you for them&mdash;here," thrusting some
uncounted coin into her hand, and standing between her
and her friend.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; seemed completely engrossed by the stranger. She
sat quietly gazing with eager questioning in her look, (her
arm half extended, as if to receive the lemons,) into the
Quadroon's face. As Hilda bustled about nervously,
coming as much as possible between the two, she would,
involuntarily as it were, turn her head one side and the
other, so as to get a view of the girl, whom her companion
succeeded in half hiding from her sight. The Quadroon
seemed intent, too, on evading equally with herself, the
form of Hilda, until the latter, having completed the bargain,
told her quite peremptorily that she might go, and
hurriedly shut the door.</p>

<p>"It is very strange and provoking," said Hilda, "that
people don't know when they are dismissed, but persist in
hanging around one in this style;" at the same time, looking
anxiously towards her friend.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; said nothing, but seemed absorbed in thought. Hilda
stood by her arranging her hair.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dennis says that we shall stay here a day and a
half, and that to-morrow he will hire a boat and take us
ashore. Won't it be delightful to tread on terra firma, and
feel that we are bona fide children of the soil again, after
the tiresome lullaby old ocean has given us, day after
day?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Zo&euml;, but half heeding what she said.</p>

<p>"Although Mr. Liebenhoff does call me the water-sprite,
I have no idea of being wedded to Neptune, with his hoary

<!--- vol 2 page 57 -->

locks yet. I shall wait till my old age for that. I am going
to turn Hamadryad, and live in one of those cedar trees I
see in the distance; and you, darling, may take up your
abode in that palmetto. That will suit you, will it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear Hilda," said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>The bell rang for tea, and she continued, "go down
without me, please, to-night. I am not quite strong yet.
To-morrow, I will accompany you on deck, and ashore, and
wherever you wish me to go."</p>

<p>Hilda knew pretty well when it was better to leave her
friend alone, so telling her that she would send her supper
to her by the stewardess, she ran to seat herself by the
captain.</p>

<p class="small">(<i>Zo&euml; alone.</i>)</p>

<p>"What a new world is dawning upon my vision, through
the simple errand of two poor peasant women! I thought
it was my second self I saw, with the huge burden of my
griefs of years made visible. What is she? So like me
in feature and expression, yet so different in the nameless,
voiceless atmosphere she carries about her! And yet, I
felt a yearning towards her, as if she were my sister, and
if I had been stronger, I should have lifted half the weight
of that vast bundle upon my shoulders. And that other
darker being who attended her! Let me bethink myself.
There are slaves in the Indies, and they were Africans,
and Africans come from the torrid zone, where the fervid sun
dyes to intensity, whatever it shines upon. Am I of that
race? I have called myself an Ethiopian, and gloried in
the title, for it spoke of fervor and enthusiasm and poetry.
But the degraded negro! that is different. Why, he is despised
wherever he abides. He is a slave, an outcast.
Am I of the slaves' origin? Am I part and parcel of degradation,
ay, a descendant of the victims of oppression,
wrong, and every form of injury? Be still, my heart, be
quiet, quiet I say, my brain! while I unravel the tangled
skein, thrown at me at the very portals of my childhood's

<!--- vol 2 page 58 -->

birth-climate. O! now it becomes clear and clearer to
me; the separate threads arrange themselves in order and
I evoke from the whole twisted knot, the story of my birth.
Yes, yes, my father's gravity of mien, my mother's pensiveness,
my warp and woof of sadness and anxiety,
scarce daring to be relieved by brighter qualities within
me, which, under genial skies, would sparkle with varied
lustre! Ah! I know it all. And perhaps that is why Miss
Ingemann disliked me. Where have I lived, that I never
thought of this? Stupid, blind, deaf, unreflecting me!
This comes of always dwelling in an ideal world, stooping
but seldom to the actual! What am I to do now, with
this revelation bursting upon me with the force of lightning?
Hush, hush, my soul! while I commune with the
Infinite Spirit, Parent of Nature, and of poor bewildered
me!"</p>

<p>This was the event of all others, to which Hilda had
looked forward with fear and dread for her friend. She
had known for a long time, that Zo&euml; was of African descent,
and what was the condition of her race wherever found.
It seemed strange to her that <i>she</i> too had not discovered
the fact. But neither her father nor mother ever alluded
to it in their letters to her, and she was so accustomed to
idealize everything in her own mind, which did not come
into direct contradiction with its nature and tendency, that
her Eastern descent was a source of an ever-flowing current
of poetry and fancy. Hilda knew this, and in proportion
to her exaggerated regard for the fact, fancy-tinted in
this way, did she fear the effect upon her of the revelation
of the naked and painful truth. For, though from Zo&euml; she
had caught something of her way of looking at her birth-right
in the division of races, from Miss Ingemann she
had imbibed another most painful impression.</p>

<p>When her teacher saw how much Hilda was swayed by
Zo&euml;, and that she was, by her example, leading her to a
very unwarrantable departure from her rules, she sent for

<!--- vol 2 page 59 -->

her to her apartment and the following conversation took
place between them:</p>

<p>"I must communicate something to you, my dear, which
you seem unaware of, and which I have forborne to speak
of, as I know your fondness for Miss Carlan. She is of
African birth."</p>

<p>"I know it, madam. The difference between us on that
very account fits us the better to be companions. I have
learned to be much more gentle and refined from her than
I otherwise should be."</p>

<p>"I hope the influences of my home are all of a nature
to produce that result, Miss Hilda?"</p>

<p>"O yes, ma'am, certainly! but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must certainly know, if she does not, that the
whole race are in a Pariah condition, and, of course, take
no <i>position</i> in Santa Cruz. You will necessarily be separated
as soon as you get home, and now I reproach
myself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Separated! What do you mean, Miss Ingemann?"</p>

<p>"Why, that as there is, and can be no equality between
you, that your parents will never permit you to continue
your acquaintance on its present footing. Zo&euml; will
sink into a very low class of society, while you will mingle
with those fitted for your companionship."</p>

<p>"Miss Ingemann, my teacher, to whom I have looked
up as a model all through my young years, do you counsel
me to perfidy and faithlessness!"</p>

<p>"God forbid! You will ever greet Zo&euml; kindly when you
meet, but your friend she can no longer be. Your parents
will never allow it. I have thought much about the matter,
and have come to the conclusion that it is unnatural for the
two races to mingle, excepting as master and servant, and
I was going to say, that I now regret and reproach myself
for permitting you to associate with such intimacy as you
have done. I see that you both are to suffer by the means,
and I really lament it on your account, my dear. But,

<!--- vol 2 page 60 -->

indeed, the first fault was in permitting her to enter my
establishment at all. I have learned a lesson for the
future."</p>

<p>Hilda stood swallowing her emotion and anger while her
teacher was speaking.</p>

<p>"Madam, I know not what may be my poor Zo&euml;'s lot. I
have many, many fears for her myself, but of this she may
be sure, that, whatever may be in the future for her, I shall
stand her friend. No matter if all the pomp, and splendor,
and fashion of the world were weighed against her, they
would not make me swerve a hair's-breadth from her, for
I know the beauty, truth, and glory of her soul, and thank
God that she has taught me to value that above all else.
O my teacher!"&mdash;She was going on in a strain of encomium
in favor of her friend, but she saw from Miss Ingemann's
face and manner, that it would not in the least impress her,
and she sickened at the thought of again forcing Zo&euml;'s rare
qualities upon an utterly prejudiced ear, so she turned and
went out. This was, more than anything, the source of her
indignation at Miss Ingemann, vailing from her for the
time many excellent qualities and her own great indebtedness
to her.</p>

<p>She now laid awake a full hour, thinking how she could
alleviate for Zo&euml; the painful knowledge of her being one
of this servile people. She thought over the principal
characters among her tribe, who had made their mark upon
the world, Toussaint L'Ouverture, Payenga, Placido, and
Dumas, besides others known in history and the present
times. In her sincere love for her friend, she turned over
and over in her mind, how she could most strongly, and at
the same time, delicately express her own affection and
admiration for her, which should never be abated by the
opinions of society, whatever they might be.</p>

<p>In thinking of all this, and of other means by which she
might express her tenderness and sympathy, she warmed
herself to a point of great fervor, and even became in

<!--- vol 2 page 61 -->

danger of turning admirer of herself, especially for two or
three particular expressions, which seemed to her really
eloquent and poetical, and she fell asleep to see in her
dreams the sweet visions, which come only to pure and
truthful minds and loving hearts.</p>

<p>Zo&euml;'s nature, ever hopeful and bright in the upper world
of fancy and imagination, commuting, as it did, every untoward
incident and dark event into light and loveliness,
however it might seem to the realist, after the first shock
was over, recognized in this discovery of her race only the
surer and speedier call to the great mission to which God
had devoted her.</p>

<p>"Father, I thank thee," she said, "for this revelation of
thy designs for thy child and servant, and for making it
doubly dear and beautiful by rejoining me to my people,
for now I see plainly that I can gaze into their deep,
mournful eyes, whose glance is ever forced within by the
harsh world's unsympathizing and scornful gaze, and meet
the answer to my ceaseless questioning. O welcome to
my soul is the reply to my whole life's wailing appeal for
love and power to act out my being's instincts! O glorious
destiny! to raise the fallen, comfort the sorrowful, and not
only point, but lead the way to a virtue as yet undreamed
of, and a happiness commensurate with eternity."</p>

<p>In such jubilant strains did she spend the hours before
she fell asleep, and she awakened in the morning with a
hope and exhilaration of spirits never felt before, so that
when Hilda, fearful and trembling, came into her state-room,
with her budget of comfort and alleviation all ready
to be poured out at her feet, she found that, so far from
its being needed, Zo&euml; was the one to set the tune of the
day to bright and joyous measures.</p>

<p>Human nature has a spice of perversity in it, and it was
manifest for a few moments in Hilda, for the first feeling,
when seeing Zo&euml;'s pensive face lighted up by a more
radiant expression than usual, was disappointment at the

<!--- vol 2 page 62 -->

waste of so much beautiful, consolatory material as she had
all in readiness to furnish her. But her chagrin was
quickly turned to wonder at this new manifestation of her
companion, who was continually mystifying her by strange
and eccentric changes. But this slight disappointment was
followed by true enjoyment at Zo&euml;'s good spirits, and they
were soon in busy chat about what they should do to amuse
themselves during the day.</p>

<p>Mr. Dennis offered his services to Mr. Sarran to assist
him in escorting the ladies to the island. A boat was
chartered, and, with two or three others of the passengers,
they were rowed to <i>Ireland</i>, and soon were sauntering over
its verdant slopes, and shaded by its noble forest trees.
Vague memories of tropic scenes came one by one to Zo&euml;'s
mind as she threaded her way through copse and glen, and
the spirit of Poesy made music in her soul, as the breezes
gently fanned her brow, and the trees waved in unison with
their breath.</p>

<p>Both Zo&euml; and Hilda read and spoke English well and
were familiar with Shakspeare's plays. The latter could
recite many passages from them. Zo&euml;, on the contrary,
had a less ready memory, but her nature was like the
magnet, which attracted to it its affinities in thought, poetry,
and fact; and while she, at the same time, kept distinct
from herself the individuality of each author with whom
she was put in communion, she absorbed into her own
being their subtle essence, thus adding to its growth and
beauty.</p>

<p>"These are the vexed Bermoothes of which Shakspeare
wrote, I suppose," said Mr. Dennis.</p>

<p>"O yes," said Hilda, "where Prospero and Miranda
lived, and where Ferdinand wooed and won her. And
Ariel and Caliban, why this is classic ground, Zo&euml;. How
beautiful is that passage where Miranda pities her lover
for his servile labor and wishes to aid him," and she began
to repeat the lines as she walked.</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 63 -->

<p>Zo&euml; disengaged herself from her companions and turned
aside to a seat among geraniums, cacti, and japonicas,
with a palmetto rearing its fan-like summit near, and thus
she breathed out her soul:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"Welcome, ye generous products of my native clime,<br/>

Children, as I am, of the torrid sunshine!<br/>

Long, long have we been divided;<br/>

Ye have bloomed on meanwhile in the sweet consciousness,<br/>

Though feeble it may be, that ye were doing your Maker's bidding,<br/>

While doubt, dissatisfaction, and vague yearnings&mdash;<br/>

A shadowy train&mdash;have ever close attended me.<br/>

But now I clasp ye to my heart of hearts<br/>

In tenderest embraces. Speak to me, my tree,<br/>

Ye many-fingered! Tell me, ye know and love me!<br/>

O waft your fragrance to me, flowers, as sign of recognition.<br/>

I have nursed your namesakes in the snowy land,<br/>

All for your sakes, beloved!<br/>

O many tinted ocean! coral-reef-ed ocean!<br/>

Islet-studded, zephyr-breez-ed ocean!<br/>

Fain would I be imbosomed in your warm and fluent waters<br/>

That ye might hush to rest my longing, love-lorn being!<br/>

O deign to mingle with your roar a tenderer note<br/>

As welcome to your votary. As you kiss the sands<br/>

Leave the impression, ever so faint, 'This is for Zo&euml;.'<br/>

And though it may be enigmatical to all besides,<br/>

I hold the key which can interpret it.<br/>

Yes, yes, ye answer well to my appealing,<br/>

Deep, deep in my soul sounds low and gentle the replying<br/>

Come to us, lonely one,<br/>

Trust in us, aspiring one,<br/>

Ever love us, impassioned one,<br/>

Grow like us, inquiring one,<br/>

Reflect God like us, thou chosen one&mdash;<br/>

Be ever near and nearer to us, immortal one,<br/>

So shalt thou be one with Him, eternal one.<br/>

Ay, ay, this is the mystery of thy revealing,<br/>

May I obey it!<br/>

And this is the scene of the weird working<br/>

Of thy subtle genius, England's wondrous son!<br/>

God! I thank thee for the gift with which<br/>

Thou didst invest him to speak with power<br/>

And thrilling harmony to the ages.<br/>

May we not cling too closely to him, but see in him<br/>

A light to guide us to an equal height of inspiration.<br/>

<!--- vol 2 page 64 -->

For no god nor tyrant was he for the world's worship<br/>

And subjection, but one, who in life so meekly<br/>

Bore his heaven-invested dignity, that the world's<br/>

More noisy great ones scarcely noted him, while by his<br/>

Fellows was he better known as <i>sweet Will Shakspeare</i>,<br/>

Than as the Swan of Avon.<br/>

Prospero! with thy magic mantle,<br/>

And thy subtle spirit, Ariel! what were they,<br/>

And what thy marvelous strength of will<br/>

And wonder-working? Is there a power in man to rule<br/>

The elements in the outer world, and still more potent might<br/>

To sway his inner being? To be the wise and tender fate<br/>

To guide his destiny, and to summon him<br/>

To God's nearer presence, even as the mother hushes<br/>

Her babe into the sweet and peaceful realm of sleep?<br/>

Does God intrust us with his parental power<br/>

Of lullaby, by which the worn and weary body<br/>

Drops from the soul prepared and winged for flight<br/>

Into his higher temple of the boundless universe?<br/>

O my asking soul! never gathering from the wisdom<br/>

Of the past, finalities to rest upon, only hint<br/>

And impulse to pry and question more<br/>

Of the deeps profound of Nature and its Author!<br/>

Prospero! a wizard wert thou, feared and dreaded;<br/>

But as no imagining is vouchsafed to man<br/>

Which he is not to realize, in some sense in his actual,<br/>

So do I gather from thy coarse and barbarous might,<br/>

An inkling into the more humane and loving future,<br/>

When the powers of man shall be so subdued<br/>

By the spirit taught and lived by Jesus,<br/>

That God will, in a new and higher sense,<br/>

Than we now wot of, adopt us as his co-creators,<br/>

Co-workers, and ministers to a beautiful life,<br/>

And still more beautiful euthanasy.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; rejoined her companions, and after stopping a few
moments at the yard of the prison to traffic with the convicts&mdash;who
thrust their hands through the grating as they
passed&mdash;in specimens of the spar of the island, cut into
various forms and highly polished, they returned to their
boat and were soon on board ship again.</p>

<p>THE next morning the <i>Forth</i> was
on her way towards the Bahamas, at
which islands their stay was brief.
After a few hours' delay, they were
steaming away towards Mobile, their
next point of destination.  They arrived
in the night.  Hilda went down
to breakfast at the usual early hour.</p>

<p>"Good morning, my Volkyria,"
said Mr. Sarran. "What news from Valhalla? But where
is your shadowy friend, does she yet fear the daylight?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Hilda. "I can't persuade her to come
upon deck yet."</p>

<p>"O but she must, she must! It won't do at all. I must go

<!--- vol 2 page 66 -->

to her, I plainly see, and bring her up in my arms. She
will allow an old man that privilege, especially one who
learned how from daily practice lang syne"&mdash;and the old
man's voice trembled.</p>

<p>Hilda remembered the story of his early sorrows&mdash;how
he first lost his wife, then a lovely young daughter, leaving
him alone in his home, and from these bereavements were
dated his roving propensities.</p>

<p>"I shall insist upon her coming on deck after breakfast,
and I will tell her of your intention," said she, glad of
being reinforced by what she knew would be an additional
inducement for Zo&euml; to rise, to escape Mr. Sarran's rather
too demonstrative friendship. Hilda would always joke
and play with him, and never refuse a seat upon his knee
if he drew her towards him; but Zo&euml; was kept in perpetual
trepidation lest he should take advantage of what he called
an old man's right, an occasional kiss, or the support of his
embracing arm as she walked the deck.</p>

<p>"Zo&euml;" said Hilda, on her return to her, "get up, dear,
Mr. Sarran is coming soon to take you upon deck in his
arms."</p>

<p>"Heavens and earth! Hilda, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Only what I say. You are weak and he is strong as a
polar bear you know, so he will kindly save you the trouble
of walking."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; rose and bustled about anxiously for the different
articles of her wardrobe, exclaiming, "Do help me, Hilda
dear&mdash;there, that will do&mdash;tie this, please&mdash;button that if
you love me"&mdash;till quite exhausted she sank upon the side
of her berth, still reaching after her shawl, saying, "throw
it over my shoulders and let us go at once."</p>

<p>Hilda, who had hardly restrained her laughter, now burst
out in great glee.</p>

<p>"What is your great haste? Do give good, gallant Mr.
Sarran the felicity of feeling that he is all-important to
you."

<!--- vol 2 page 67 -->

<p>"I had rather administer to his happiness in some other
way. I must confess, Hilda, I shall be thankful when we
are free from his tender assiduities. The price he sets
upon them is quite too irksome for me to render. I avoid
him as much as I can with any sort of decency, seeing we
have put ourselves under his protection."</p>

<p>"You do not like him, do you?"</p>

<p>"Only at a distance&mdash;when he is so deep in his afternoon
nap, or in his game of whist, or his after-dinner discussion
and wine, that I know I shall be safe from him. I
wish old men would not make themselves so disagreeable,
for I always wish to love them."</p>

<p>"O never mind if he does pet you. I believe I am a born
coquette, Zo&euml;, and if I cannot find any better subject to
flirt with, why Mr. Sarran will answer very well; and the
old gentleman likes the joke as well, I verily believe.
We have got up quite a flirtation together, if you will
believe it."</p>

<p>"Take care, Hilda, or you will get into trouble."</p>

<p>"Nonsense; we are merely joking, of course, just to
while away the monotony on board. He understands it."</p>

<p>"Take care, I say again, or you may really pain Mr.
Sarran. He has a very affectionate heart, is susceptible
to kindness, and is almost alone in the world. There is
no knowing what hopes you may awaken in him."</p>

<p>"You are mighty tender of our friend all at once, it
seems. I thought you only liked him at a distance."</p>

<p>"True; I wish he would never kiss me. I am not willing
that many persons should, and never a gentleman,
unless I love him a deal better than Mr. Sarran. But I
regard him quite too much to wish to see his feelings hurt,
poor man."</p>

<p>"You know I would not injure them more than you,
Zo&euml;. But I do really love fun, and so does he, and why
should we not enjoy ourselves. This is the first time I
ever thought you prudish."</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 68 -->

<p>"O don't call me so, for I detest the word. But, dear,
we are left to our own guidance now, and I think we ought
to be careful. Remember how kind and watchful Miss
Ingemann was of our characters in this respect."</p>

<p>"O yes," said Hilda, "I don't forget; but I am going to
enjoy myself, nevertheless. I am as happy and joyous as
the day is long, and if I know that my heart is innocent
and kindly towards every one, what harm can I do? One
would think I was a Medusa to hear you talk, my little
guardian angel, only better, for you are not too good yet
for naughty, human love, such as what I have ever for
you, brimming up and running over;" and she threw her
arms around her and caressed her until Zo&euml; begged for
quarter.</p>

<p>"Anything but a Medusa, darling," said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"Away with you then! I'll not be a bugbear to frighten
even one little joy away. Come, we'll steal a march on
Mr. Sarran. He is not going to touch so much as his little
finger to assist me," and arm in arm they went on deck.</p>

<p>They seated themselves on a bench and looked about
them. The ship's crew were busy taking in coal, and the
luggage of the passengers, who had just come on board.
The wharf was covered with drays, wagons, omnibusses,
carriages and negroes, and the two girls sat making their
observations. Zo&euml;'s eyes were for the most part riveted
upon the slaves, as some of them brought their loads with
slow, thoughtful faces, and such deep sad eyes, as made
her sigh to see them. Others looked stupid and abject,
as if either the soul-spark never had been awakened,
or had been benumbed by cruel usage, while others, the
larger number, cracked jokes among themselves, played
tricks upon each other, and in extravagant fashion and language,
exchanged the greetings of the morning.</p>

<p>Hilda felt ill at ease at first, in the presence of Zo&euml;,
with them on every side, but she thought of her cheerfulness
since her first meeting with the Bermuda women, and

<!--- vol 2 page 69 -->

she was emboldened to speak when she saw their apparent
happiness.</p>

<p>"Those people look very happy, do they not? See that
little boy turning somerset; and his playmate puts his cap
on his feet while they are up in the air, so that he is a
monster with two heads. What a shout of laughter from
the whole group! They <i>are</i> happy, are they not?"</p>

<p>"They are quite merry just now."</p>

<p>"That American lady who visited Mrs. Pendleton last
summer, who had lived in a slaveholding state, said 'that
the negroes were, after all, happier than their masters and
mistresses.' "</p>

<p>"O, of course!"</p>

<p>"And that they had an easier life, than those who held
them in slavery."</p>

<p>"Of course, dear, it could not be otherwise."</p>

<p>Hilda turned to look at Zo&euml;, to see what she meant. She
gathered no answer from the expression of her face, which
was one of mingled thoughtfulness, pity and sadness.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by 'of course.' I have not thought
so, I am sure."</p>

<p>"You cannot think that the unjust are ever happier than
the injured, if innocent. If the slaves act as well as their
circumstances will allow them, they are very near to 'Our
Father,' which of itself is happiness; while the injurer, by
his very injustice, shuts out God's presence from his soul,
and what misery can be so great as that?"</p>

<p>"But many of the slaveholders are very kind and indulgent
to their slaves, Mrs. Taylor said."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; said nothing.</p>

<p>"Do you think it so <i>very</i> wrong, for such persons to
hold them?"</p>

<p>"Wrong, to pretend to own a human being, Hilda? If
Jesus were on earth, do you think it would be right to hold
him as a slave?"</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 70 -->

<p>"My dear, how different the two cases! You shock me,
by such a question."</p>

<p>"They are just the same, just the same."</p>

<p>Hilda marveled at her friend, and looked serious for a
moment, and seeing Mr. Sarran, ran to meet him. He
drew her arm within his own, and they walked up and down
the deck, chatting and laughing together.</p>

<p>They soon approached the bench where Zo&euml; was sitting,
Mr. Sarran saying, as he handed Hilda to her seat, bowing
at the same time profoundly, and laying his hand on his
heart:</p>

<p>"May your Viking hope that his Queen will preserve his
image enshrined within her pericardium, while he roams
for a brief period?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if he return laden with the roses, jasmines and
heliotropes of this halcyon clime, as a propitiation."</p>

<p>"And orange flowers," said he, partly dropping on one
knee.</p>

<p>"Ay, and a vail of tulle," said she, letting her head fall
on one side, and looking very modest. "How unhappy I am
that my bridesmaid is so far aloft, as to be unmindful of
my feelings, and thus neglect to spare them on this tender
and delicate occasion!"</p>

<p>Mr. Sarran laughed and called her roguish, looking
pleased at the same time, as his simple, honest face was
seen descending the steps of the vessel to go on shore.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; slowly shook her head at Hilda, but forbore to say
anything.</p>

<p>"I am a sad trial to you, am I not? But what are life
and liberty good for, unless one can enjoy herself? Why,
I am like a bottle of champagne that has been corked for
years. The stopper is flying out just now, but the extra
gas will puff off in a little time, and I shall remain a sparkling,
brilliant wine of the first order, that will be just the
article to flush and brighten the semi-soberness, demi-dullness

<!--- vol 2 page 71 -->

of my wise, youthful Mentoress," and Hilda sang
a snatch of a lively German air.</p>

<p>"O! there are the new passengers," said she; "look,
Zo&euml;."</p>

<p>They now began their speculations upon them.</p>

<p>"That mild, handsome gentleman in black is one, I suppose,"
said Zo&euml;. "I like his looks so much. His face
expresses high and refined thought and feeling. And see,
how observant he is of everything. He is pointing at
something on shore, and directing that young lady's attention
towards it."</p>

<p>"That younger and taller gentleman is his brother, I
suspect. They resemble each other. Is not <i>he</i> handsome?
and what a noble air he has!" said Hilda.</p>

<p>"If he <i>is</i> his brother, he is very different; for he looks
so much more like a man of the world than the first
one."</p>

<p>"And those two young ladies. Do you think they are
married to them?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so. No, they resemble them too much. They
must be their sisters."</p>

<p>"What splendid eyes the taller one has! How they
sparkle when she laughs! Do you think she is handsome?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Her eyes are handsome, to say the least. She
is what Miss Ingemann would call high-bred; and she is
something better than merely that too, for I see she looks
thoughtful, and now a shade of sadness comes over her
face."</p>

<p>"Yes, she is dressed in black, you see. I wonder what
friend she has lost," said Hilda.</p>

<p>"But the other one. I wish she would turn her head,"
said Zo&euml;. "She has scarcely looked from that one point
for the last ten minutes. O, now I see! She has more
regular features than the other, but it is not so easy to read
the character of her face as that of the taller one."</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 72 -->

<p>"They are like some Spaniards I saw once. I wonder
if they are of that nation? The younger gentleman looks
like a Don, does he not? I should like to know where
they are going. But who is this? See, Zo&euml;, see! May
Odin protect us! Did my eyes ever behold such an impersonation
of solemnity and woe-begoneness!"</p>

<p>The individual, who now riveted their attention, was tall,
elderly, and gaunt. His face was furrowed deeply, his eye
was sad and lack-luster, and his hair but thinly shaded his
high brow. But the most remarkable features were his
cheek and mouth. The corners of the latter were drawn
down, while the lips were closed with a perceptible
pucker. These two combined expressions gave a hard,
stiff look to the whole side-cheek, peculiarly repulsive in
its character. But the most painful idea connected with
the whole physiognomy was, that it was not truthful and
natural. Not that the man looked wicked, far from it; but
through some superstition or asceticism, he had brought
himself to suppose that to look very serious and solemn
was the true expression of a child of God, and, therefore,
he was determined to train his face to the idea. A life-long
nurture of this mistaken notion had had the effect of
thus disfiguring him.</p>

<p>It was a cool morning, and he had a large cloak with a
small cape thrown over him, and as he gazed over the vessel's
side upon the scene on shore, he placed his arms
akimbo under it, thereby extending it like a huge pall between
Hilda and Zo&euml; and the view of the town. The girls
looked at each other significantly. After standing thus a
few moments, he half turned towards them, so that they
could see his side face; his jaws moved, as if chewing
some substance, when suddenly he expectorated a nauseous
fluid, which fell in a loathsome puddle upon the
clean, holystoned deck, and then with measured tread he
slowly walked away.</p>

<p>"O dreadful!" said Zo&euml;.</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 73 -->

<p>"What <i>is</i> the matter with him?" said Hilda. "He must
be very sick."</p>

<p>"If <i>he</i> is not I am," said Zo&euml;. "Do assist me to my
state-room." Her stomach was still suffering from the
effects of sea-sickness, and this disgusting and heedless
exhibition of uncleanliness was quite too much for it in its
present delicate state.</p>

<p>"Detestable!" said she, as she sank on her berth, her
face expressing the disturbance she suffered from.</p>

<p>"What can ail the man?" said Hilda.</p>

<p>"O! nothing but a filthy habit," said Zo&euml;. "I recollect
Mrs. Pendleton said that her countrymen chewed the nasty
tobacco-weed, and that there was scarcely a place in the
United States clean from the effects of this disgusting
practice. Pah!"</p>

<p>The ship was soon in motion, and Hilda was on deck
amidst the excitement of leaving; Zo&euml;, sea-sick again, remained
below. For the whole day she was on her couch,
too ill to rise, but well enough to enjoy the view of the
ocean through her port-hole, Tennyson's new poem, which
Mr. Sarran had kindly purchased for her in the city, and
Hilda's sketches of the passengers, which she gave her
from time to time.</p>

<p>She came into her state-room in a glow of excitement.</p>

<p>"O, Zo&euml;," said she, "there is another new passenger,
which you did not see."</p>

<p>"A lady?"</p>

<p>"No, a young gentleman, equal to the Druid, in his own
way, which is a very different one."</p>

<p>"How does he look?"</p>

<p>"He is tall&mdash;more than six feet, I should think. He
must have been intended for a giant, but Nature forgot to
fill out his proportions, for he is as straight and slender as
a reed."</p>

<p>"Is he handsome?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know what to say. He has a very clear, gray

<!--- vol 2 page 74 -->

eye, and handsome brow, and his nose is well enough. As
for his mouth and chin, they may, or not be, for they are
scarcely visible, being covered by a long moustache and an
untrimmed beard, giving him a very shaggy look. But his
hair, Zo&euml;, O, if you could only see that! It is almost as
long as mine; of a beautiful brown, and as soft as silk."</p>

<p>"How does he manage this feminine accompaniment,
pray?"</p>

<p>"In no woman's fashion, I can assure you. When it
falls over his shoulders in front, so as to be in his way, he
gives it a toss back, like a high-spirited horse, when on the
full run. When it drops upon his forehead, he runs his
fingers through it, giving it a twirl on the top of his head,
leaving it in a sort of loop, pointed at the top like a horn;
the symbol of power, you know, and, in short, he plays all
sorts of off-hand tricks with it."</p>

<p>"A funny specimen of humanity, he must be."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, you would have laughed to see our meeting.
I ran up the gangway, and the first person I saw,
was this figure. He was standing looking out upon the
shore, one foot a little in advance of the other, the latter
bent a little, as he rested upon the one behind, his arms
folded, his head thrown back, and his eye taking in everything
that passed before it. But his dress, Zo&euml;, O! his
dress! His pants are too short for him, so are his coat-sleeves.
The latter garment, is a rather loose one, with a
leathern belt around his waist. His hat is a soft, broad-brimmed
beaver, with the crown all crumpled up, apparently
by design, just to look odd and strange, I know. He
wears it either on one side or else thrown on the back of
his head."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; laughed.</p>

<p>"Have you heard the phenomenon speak?"</p>

<p>"O yes, and that is the best of it. I stood for a minute,
taken completely aback, then moved forward a little, looking
around for a seat. At that moment, he saw me, and,

<!--- vol 2 page 75 -->

quick as lightning, sprang for the only chair visible, and
brought it to me, saying, 'Take a seat, ma'am? Pleasant
day!'</p>

<p>"I said, thank you, yes, very pleasant&mdash;another spring,
and he brought a stool for my feet; so there I sat, perched
up, thinking I was wonderfully waited upon, and wondered
if all the American young gentlemen were as polite as
he."</p>

<p>"Did you have any farther conversation with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I could not avoid it if I had wished to. He was
disposed to talk, and one subject led to another, until we
were in great glee. It is like taking exhilarating gas to be
with him. You have to laugh whether you will or not.
There is no place like shipboard, to make friends. All
conventionalism is dropped, and you walk straight into
people at once."</p>

<p>"Dear Hilda, you must be careful in making the acquaintance,
of gentlemen, at least. Do be a little more
reserved. It is but the part of a lady, I will assure you."</p>

<p>Hilda looked thoughtful for a moment, and then said;
"Those dark-eyed young ladies, and their brother, think so
too, for they repelled me with a very dignified air, when I
attempted to get up a little acquaintance with them, and
when I was talking with my knight of the waving locks,
they rose, and seated themselves at a distance from us."</p>

<p>"There, dear, let that serve as a hint to you, to be less
hasty in forming friendships."</p>

<p>"It will be a hint to return the compliment to their dignity,
in a similar fashion. I can erect my crest as well as
they;" and Hilda straightened her tall and elegant figure
to its full height. "I do not wish for their fellowship, if
they are so saving of it." She paused a moment, and then
broke out. "The fact is, Zo&euml;, you must get well, and
come up on deck, and take care of me. I never get on
safely without you. There is one gentleman you will like,
I know; the elder of that party, to which the Don and his

<!--- vol 2 page 76 -->

sisters belong. He is dignity and affability combined, and
talks delightfully."</p>

<p>"I shall do so, very soon. The captain says, that we
shall be in quiet seas, before many days, and I already feel
much better."</p>

<p>"Mr. Sarran has seen the list of passengers, and learned
the names of the new ones. The Druid is the Rev. Dr.
Chichester, from Missouri, United States. The younger
gentleman in black, is Mr. Lindsey, and the name of the
brother and sisters, is Pierson. As for the <i>Pine Tree</i>, I
have not learned his genus and species, technically."</p>

<p>Mr. Pierson and his sisters sat apart from the other passengers.
A gentleman from Boston, and a young English
officer, bound to Barbadoes, had just risen from seats near
them, to walk the deck.</p>

<p>"I wish you to be very careful in selecting your associates
here. Keep a stiff upper lip, and do not be encroached
upon by any one. That young Danish girl is a
perfect hoyden. I would make her keep her distance,"
said the gentleman.</p>

<p>"She is fine-looking," said the elder, whose name was
Emma.</p>

<p>"She is too little refined," said her brother. "Do you
see how free she is with that rough-looking <i>Young America?</i>
She is just like a boarding-school miss set free, who
does not know how to use her liberty."</p>

<p>"Her companion is a colored girl, I should think," said
the younger sister.</p>

<p>"She is so. Of course you will not make a companion
of her. Mr. Custis will introduce you to his mother, and
the young English officer, I am glad to know."</p>

<p>"There is Mr. Lindsey in conversation with Miss Strophel
and Young America," said Meta Pierson.</p>

<p>"Yes," said her brother. "He is no rule for us you
know, in this respect. He is a minister, and it belongs to
the cloth to know and be gracious to every one. Of course

<!--- vol 2 page 77 -->

I do not mean that this is in his disfavor, or that he is not the
very best companion that we could have&mdash;but you understand
me. He is not quite up to the highest tone of society,
you know, in his manners; and it is better, in his position,
that he is not, for he can thus be more generally useful.
Let him, of course, do as he pleases."</p>

<p>Hilda was soon on deck again reconnoitering. Her stay
was brief, however, for she was so fond of sympathy, that,
as Zo&euml; was not by her to receive every passing suggestion,
she was continually running back to talk with her.</p>

<p>"I wonder of what profession those new-comers are. I
thought Mr. Lindsey might be a minister, but as I heard
him talk about politics, I thought he must be a statesman.
Next he was talking upon agriculture, as if he had cultivated
land all his life; so I am puzzled."</p>

<p>"Whom is he talking with?"</p>

<p>"With my chevalier of the chair and stool. I am just
as much at a loss about him too. I never thought he was
a clergyman, it is true, but during the conversation, by
turns, I thought him a farmer, a notary, and now I have
come to the conclusion that he is an artist, he talks so enthusiastically
about paintings. By the way, he has got his
easel with him, so he must be one."</p>

<p>"And the elder gentleman?"</p>

<p>"He is <i>the Reverend Dr. Chichester</i>; there can be no
mistake about him. But may I be spared from his ministrations!
He never would carry me to heaven, I know, but
leave me groping about in the darkest part of the under-world.
Good-by."</p>

<p>In the course of an hour she was with Zo&euml; again.</p>

<p>"Now I think I have it. But would you believe it? that
mild, cultivated gentleman, Mr. Lindsey, is an instructor
in gymnastics. He has had his coat off for the last half
hour, teaching <i>le cheveluse</i>&mdash;I may as well call him so&mdash;in
that science. He has an empty decanter in one hand,
and a pitcher in the other, to serve as clubs, and such

<!--- vol 2 page 78 -->

demonstrations you never beheld. His pupil follows his
example exactly&mdash;now swinging the weights&mdash;now turning
himself round about on a pole&mdash;now at his full length on
the deck in strange contortions. I am hardly alive for the
laughter I have been subjected to. Yes, Mr. Lindsey
must be a gymnast."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; laughed. "I suspect," said she, "that they both
belong to a class very common in America, for I remember
that a writer in the New York <i>Evening Post</i>, which I read
at Mr. K&ouml;rner's one day, said that the '<i>Yankees</i>'&mdash;a name
which some persons give to the people of the United
States&mdash;are Jacks at all trades and good at none."</p>

<p>" 'Jacks at all trades and good at none,' " repeated Hilda.
"If they undertake and carry everything through with as
much spirit as they do those exercises, they will, in time,
be good at everything, I should think. I am going to see
what comes next on the tapis. O, Zo&euml;, do get well and
come up and see them."</p>

<p>"I was just thinking I would go now. Mr. Sarran will
come for me soon if I do not."</p>

<p>They ascended to the deck, and the first person they
met was Hilda's hero&mdash;Young America. He started on
seeing them together&mdash;looked first at one, and then at the
other, and half-questioning, half-asserting, said, "Zo&euml; and
Hilda?"</p>

<p>The two girls looked amazed, then Zo&euml; exclaimed,
"George Stephenson!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is your old playmate. I hope you are glad to
see him," said he, looking at Hilda, who, blushing, laughing
and half crying, extended her hand, to which he gave
a hearty shake. They then sat down, and, for the next
hour or two, were deep in reminiscences of the past.</p>

<p>THE next morning a group was seated on deck, consisting
of Mr. Lindsey, Zo&euml;, Hilda, and young Stephenson.
Mr. Pierson and his sisters sat a little apart, with the
young English officer. Mr. Sarran walked to and fro,
stopping occasionally to keep the thread of their conversation
in his mind, while Mr. Chichester, who was reading a
Tract, looked from time to time over his spectacles at
them.</p>

<p>"This is the day of the election of President," said
Mr. Lindsey. "I wish I knew who is the successful
candidate."</p>

<p>"Paysons, of course," said Mr. Pierson; "everything
tended that way, when we left."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Lindsey; "we are not far enough along
yet for a Freesoil man, but the next will be one with those
principles."</p>

<p>"Not as you know of," said George Stephenson.
"He'll be a Know Nothing, I can tell you."</p>

<p>"A Know Nothing!" said Hilda. "Do you want a dunce
for a President?"</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 80 -->

<p>"It is the name of a party," said Zo&euml;. "Do you not
remember, when we called to bid Mrs. K&ouml;rner good-by,
that Fred said he had been trying to persuade his father to
emigrate to America. Mr. K&ouml;rner objected on the ground
that he should not, perhaps, have more freedom there than
in Europe, since the Know Nothing party had arisen, as
they had such a prejudice against foreigners that they
were trying to restrict them in the right of suffrage."</p>

<p>"O! I remember it," said Hilda.</p>

<p>"Yes, we don't want any more ignorant Europeans, who
know nothing about our principles of government, yet try
to get the reins into their own hands, and fill the fattest
places in the country. Put them down, I say. They should
not vote until they have been in the country twenty-one
years. We will fix them. There shan't a mother's son
of them have an office two years hence."</p>

<p>"I agree with you that <i>American principles</i>, interpreted
in the most liberal and Christian way, with the increasing
light which every age can throw upon them, should hold
rule in the counsels of our nation. These are no less
beneficial to the strangers, who flock to our shores, than to
us. God forbid, that we should repeat through them the
worn out policy of the old world governments. Our
country was opened to the races for better things than that
career!"</p>

<p>"Then we must put down the Dutch and Irish," said
Stephenson.</p>

<p>"I am much more afraid of demagogues among our own
people than of any body of foreigners. It is they who
give the latter the power to injure us. They make the
ignorant among them tools for their selfish and base
designs, deceiving them by their misrepresentations, and
setting them on to, and joining them in the commission of
deeds which disgrace us in the world's eyes, and retard
the legitimate workings of our noble institutions," said
Mr. Lindsey.</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 81 -->

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Pierson, "politics have got to be such
a miserable game for the demagogues of all parties, that I
have concluded to have nothing to do with them. I did
not vote at all this year."</p>

<p>"There you was very wrong, in my opinion, Horace, excuse
me," said Mr. Lindsey. "What is to become of the
country, if the most high-toned men thus neglect their
first duty of a free citizen? It is virtually giving it over
into the hands of its destroyers."</p>

<p>"Whom should I vote for? I like neither of the candidates,
and could not make up my mind which was the
better one."</p>

<p>"On the fence, hey?" said Stephenson.</p>

<p>"Yes, and it is so muddy both sides, that I had rather
be excused from jumping either way."</p>

<p>"Vote for the best man on the whole, is my rule. The
fact is, we cannot live in exhausted receivers. We must
accept our lot with our fellow-men, and work with, and act
for them as our most enlightened conscience guides us.
If we stand aloof from them, from any dilettante notion of
superiority, and wrap ourselves up in self-satisfaction at
our purer and higher purposes, ten to one the wave of
popular opinion will not make an unwonted swell onwards,
in some unexpected moment, leaving us stranded far behind.
Depend upon it, the average of popular thought is
equal to, if not in advance of any single individual. I
stand by the people, not of course, allowing them to arbitrarily
govern me, but simply acting up to my highest convictions
in my choice of leaders for myself and them,"
said Mr. Lindsey.</p>

<p>Mr. Chichester now spoke in a very deliberate and
solemn tone:</p>

<p>"I never vote, being a minister of the Gospel, as I think
it is not consistent with doing my Master's work, to trouble
my mind much with such worldly matters. But this, I will
say, that the needless discussions upon the subject of our

<!--- vol 2 page 82 -->

peculiar Institution, is the chief cause of trouble in our
country. Until the North ceases to meddle with what is
not her business, we shall never be at peace again."</p>

<p>"The Abolitionists have done a vast amount of mischief,"
said Young America.</p>

<p>"Mr. Webster had the right ideas upon the subject. If
we had followed his wise counsels, we should be better off
than we are now. The Union is in great danger," said
Mr. Pierson.</p>

<p>"Three propositions," said Mr. Lindsey, "which we
might discuss the whole length of our voyage, and yet not
change each other's views; so I will simply say, that as a
Minister of the Gospel, I deem it my first duty, to act the
part of a man in the legitimate affairs of men; of a citizen,
in what concerns the weal of myself and family, no less
than that of my fellows; and especially to bear my testimony,
as every Christian should, against the greatest sin
and wrong of the times. Slavery affects every part of the
country, in its religion, morals, social well-being, and pecuniary
prosperity. Farther than this, though I belong to
no association of Abolitionists, I respect them as earnest,
unflinching advocates for the rights of the slaves, and believe
that their leaders will fill a higher place in history,
than many now called great through advocacy of compromising
measures, instead of taking their stand upon eternal
principles. As for the dissolution of the Union, I have no
fears for it, but I say, dissolve it, rather than strike hands
with injustice and wrong forever."</p>

<p>Mr. Chichester shook his head and said, "We had
fallen on evil times, and that we needed a refreshing from
the presence of the Lord. That it behooved his servant to
pray that he might not stay his coming. That he would
vouchsafe to come right down into our midst and save his
elect, and especially scatter all wolves in sheep's clothing,
who taught the wicked devices of their own corrupt natures
instead of the essential doctrines of the Bible."</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 83 -->

<p>"Are you a clergyman?" said Mr. Stephenson to Mr.
Lindsey.</p>

<p>"Certainly, why not?"</p>

<p>"I am astonished," said he, looking embarrassed. "Why,
I have talked to you just like any other man. Yes, and I
asked you to take a hand at whist last evening. I beg your
pardon, by George&mdash;he-e-e! excuse me, but you were so
cheerful, I never once thought of such a thing, as your
belonging to the cloth."</p>

<p>"Of course, I am cheerful, my friend. That is one of
the privileges of a profession which brings one into such
intimate communion with God, nature, and the deepest
soul of humanity. How could I be otherwise?"</p>

<p>Mr. Stephenson made no answer, but looked towards
Mr. Chichester, as a refutation of the remark.</p>

<p>"May I ask what order you are of," he continued.</p>

<p>"Of the Unitarian Congregationalist."</p>

<p>Mr. Chichester drew down the corners of his mouth to
the extremest possible limits, and looked over his spectacles
at Mr. Lindsey's pedal extremities, to see if either of them
were cloven, drew a deep sigh, and resumed the reading
of his Tract, which was entitled, "The Swift Road to Everlasting
Burnings."</p>

<p>"They call your sect infidels, up in our diggings," said
Young America.</p>

<p>"O, yes," said Mr. Lindsey, "and when the children
are refractory, tell them to be still, or the Unitarians will
catch them. In the eastern States, too, we are called so
by all who value their sect more than the truth. By such,
we are told in one breath, that we are dying or dead; and,
in the next, are preached against, prayed against, while
the people are warned against us, as if we were living,
rampant, and destructive in our influence still. We are
very sorry to be regarded as such bugbears, when we take
for our motto nothing less than 'Liberty, Holiness, Love,'
and try to act up to it as far as is in our power."</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 84 -->

<p>Mr. Chichester rose and walked away, and the party
separated, each to follow their own inclinations, leaving
Mr. Lindsey and Mr. Stephenson together.</p>

<p>"I am glad to have an opportunity of talking upon the
subject of religion with a man of some brain," said the
latter. "I am disgusted with it as it is presented by the
religionists in our part of the country, and am often
tempted to throw the whole thing overboard. And yet I
know I have strong religious instincts."</p>

<p>"You have simply outgrown the present creeds and
forms in which this great good of our being is so much
enveloped, hiding its simple majesty and beauty, and presenting
a repulsive aspect to you."</p>

<p>"And I am not the only one in this condition of mind
either. In the large circuit of which I am Judge, more
than half the lawyers are skeptical. They contribute to
the support of religion from various motives, for the sake
of their families, because it is respectable for them to do
so, and they regard it as a kind of police to keep the ignorant
and superstitious in order; but they laugh at the whole
matter when they are together."</p>

<p>"You must allow me to interrupt you a moment by asking
if you are really a Judge?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, I am nothing else."</p>

<p>"You are young for that office."</p>

<p>"O yes, but Young America is the order of the day, out
West, you know. I went to Iowa five years ago, when I
was about twenty-three, as a soldier of fortune. I practiced
law, stumping it around the country, as occasion
offered, and two years since the 'boys' put me in as Judge.
The old fogies made a great row about it, thinking such a
harum-scarum fellow as I would set the river a-fire at once.
But I've taught them a thing or two."</p>

<p>"Do the people pay the office due deference, impersonated
in one so young?"</p>

<p>"Don't they? I make them toe the mark, I can tell you.

<!--- vol 2 page 85 -->

There wasn't a more disorderly community in the State
when I was elected, and now I am willing you should ask
my bitterest opponents if there is a better one."</p>

<p>"How did you bring it about?"</p>

<p>"By enforcing the laws, to be sure, and adding a few of
my own."</p>

<p>"Will they obey those!"</p>

<p>"Ye-es, they have to. If any one asks for a precedent,
if he don't like my decisions, I come down upon him like
'a thousand of brick.' We <i>make</i> laws in this office, I say.
That is the way you have to do in a new country."</p>

<p>"But the older lawyers?"</p>

<p>"O we get on bravely together since I put one of them
in jail for contempt of court. That is the way I do if all
is not right. 'Sheriff, I say, take that man out'&mdash;and he
does not hesitate a hair. It is the only way, sir."</p>

<p>These remarks were made with many gesticulations,
with an occasional toss of his hat back, and an odd adjustment
of the hair, which had so attracted Hilda's attention.</p>

<p>"But about religion," he resumed. "I was bred a
Calvinist. My father is one of the straightest of the sect.
But I can't go it now any way. I won't have a God, as
they represent him. He is a deal worse, according to
them, than the most corrupt judge in the land, putting his
own son to torture for others' sins. What kind of justice is
that, I should like to know. And then, their three in one
and one in three, I don't understand it, and I have made
up my mind that it is all fol-de-rol, and that I'll have
nothing to do with it, but give it the go-by. And yet I
can't quite do that either, for it seems to me that, when I
resolve to do so, I hear my mother, (she was a real good
woman, sir) calling me back to the faith she lived and
died by."</p>

<p>"Have you churches in your part of the country?"</p>

<p>"Yes, plenty of them. Heathen temples, I call them,
with such priests as that old fellow yonder, with faces as

<!--- vol 2 page 86 -->

long as the moral law. If their heaven is peopled by such
specimens, I beg to be excused from going there. I'll
try t'other place."</p>

<p>At that moment Zo&euml; and Hilda approached them as they
walked to and fro upon the deck. Stephenson jumped up
and offered them his seat. "Will you join us?" said Mr.
Lindsey. And they seated themselves beside him.</p>

<p>"That poor old gentleman seems very unhappy," said
Zo&euml;, glancing towards Mr. Chichester, as he stood looking
over the guards.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder," said Stephenson, "with such hell-fire
doctrines as he holds to. What I complain of is, that he
is not half unhappy enough."</p>

<p>"I should not think his worst enemy could wish him a
more doleful physiognomy than he has," said Hilda.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is bad enough; but part of it is made up.
Didn't you see how hard he tried to lengthen his visage
down to the sanctimonious point while Mr. Lindsey was
talking? I'm up to 'em. They can't come it over me
again. I was a subject of grace once, but I'm not the fish
to be caught in their net a second time."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Hilda.</p>

<p>"Why, that I was converted; went through the whole
process, slick as a whistle. Convicted, wasn't I though;
felt awfully, took the anxious seats; was pawed over;
prayed over; whispered and groaned over by the brethren,
the old maids, and the young sistren, to boot; obtained a
hope; got religion, and was set up as an example of a saint
of the first water, all in a day and a half. Lor, don't I
know the whole scheme of salvation from beginning to
end, and yet, what does it all amount to? I am no better
but all the worse for it, fallen from grace, the elect say,
and I don't know but I am."</p>

<p>Hilda laughed, and said he bore his fate very coolly.</p>

<p>"What is the use of crying for spilled milk. It is a settled
point that I can't be religious in such a humbugging way

<!--- vol 2 page 87 -->

as that is, and if the powers at head-quarters don't think
me worth saving, why, I am not the one to dispute the
matter with them."</p>

<p>"Is the revival system as much in vogue, at the West, as
it formerly was?" said Mr. Lindsey.</p>

<p>"Not quite. The fact is, there isn't the material there
once was. People begin to see through the joke. Every
spring, the preachers come together and try to get up a
holy pow-wow, but it is no go, half the time. They pray
to the Lord, as if he were the stump orator-general of the
universe, going the rounds from one section to another;
and when they want to get up the steam in any place, they
order him on to the field."</p>

<p>"Shocking!" said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"It is just the way, ma'am. I don't pretend to be pious,
and don't mince matters, as you see, but it makes my blood
run cold to hear the coarse, familiar tone in which the revival
preachers pray. And that is not the worst of it either;
for they take the occasion to tell the Lord lots of things
about himself which, I guess, he is surprised to hear, and
about the people too."</p>

<p>"I never heard of such things in Europe," said Hilda.</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Lindsey, "the character of our people
is a very intense and excitable one. They are eminently
practical too, rapid in the execution of their business, and
they have invested the subject of religion with the coarse,
materialistic tendency of the times. It is very disheartening
to all of a more rational faith, whose religion is woven
into every fibre of their souls, reclaiming, enlightening,
guiding, and exalting, to witness such perversion of this
great sentiment which connects us with God and the spiritual
world. But I am very hopeful, and regard it as a
transitory phase of our civilization, which is to give place
to a freer and better faith than the world has yet seen."</p>

<p>"You must be hopeful if you expect to see this Ph&oelig;nix
rising from the ashes of what we call 'the burnt districts,'

<!--- vol 2 page 88 -->

where the transient fire of revivalism has passed over,"
said Stephenson. "I wish you could have heard Elder
Snow hold forth, a few years ago up our way. If he wasn't
a burster! That old man yonder is not a circumstance to
him. Such swearing I never heard, as came from him as
he strove to frighten the people into the anxious seats."</p>

<p>"Swearing!" said Hilda. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Just what I say. Now I, sometimes, in the heat of excitement
take the name of his black majesty in vain, though
I know that it is not just the thing; but never do I dare to
use the titles of the Powers above in the heedless way they
do. The fact is, the churches are a regular school to teach
swearing."</p>

<p>"It may be so," said Mr. Lindsey.</p>

<p>"I <i>know</i> it," said Young America. "Why, when the
ministers curse and damn the people&mdash;excuse me ladies&mdash;as
they do every three or four sentences, what can you
expect of us sinners, I should like to know? If they use
the holy names so glibly in denouncing us, why should it
be strange that rude and thoughtless boys and young men
should do the same? Reform the preachers first, I say,
and then we'll mend our ways in this respect. Elder Snow
swore more in an hour's sermon than I ever did in my
whole life."</p>

<p>"That is a novel use to put churches to," said Hilda,
very much amused at his recital.</p>

<p>"It is a fact. I have a good mind now to tell you my
'experunce' of religion, as the old women call it."</p>

<p>"O do!" said Hilda.</p>

<p>"Well, the old governor, as I said before, is one of the
straightest of the sect now, since he gave up politics and the
world, which happened when he was disappointed of an
office under government after his return from Denmark."</p>

<p>"The governor! what, of your State?" said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"Lor! no, ma'am, my father. That is the cant phrase
we use in speaking of the old gentleman. He was always

<!--- vol 2 page 89 -->

<i>at</i> me to <i>get religion</i>. My mother was one of the excellent
of the earth. You remember her, Hilda. She died
when I was seventeen, but I never forgot her pious instructions,
and I know she prayed for my conversion every day
of her life. So you see I was pretty tender upon that
point, and I often wished I could bring it about, if it was
only to please her; but I did not know how to go to work
exactly, for the preacher mystified me so with his <i>you-can-and-you-can't,
you shall-and-you-shan't, you'll-be-damned-if-you-don't</i>
doctrine, that I was all in a puzzle. After
mother's death, an aunt of mine, my father's sister, kept
our house and took care of the children; and between you
and me and the post, she was no better than she should
be. She was a real termagant, and we youngsters had to
stand round, I can tell you. Well, I went away to college,
was gone two years, kicked up a rumpus with some of the
<i>b'hoys</i>, and was politely told that I might make myself
scarce in those whereabouts; so, of course, I bowed myself
away from the premises. Went home, father was
awful mad, wouldn't speak to me for three days. I did
not care so much for that, for he was always rather stern
with me, and I expected as much. But my mother's picture
hung in my room, and when I awoke in the morning,
the first thing I saw were her eyes (she had beautiful eyes,
if you remember her, Zo&euml;) looking straight upon me. Then
I felt bad, I can tell you. I cried like a child; the first time
since her death. Then I expected my aunt would give it
to me in great style, for disgracing the family by my expulsion,
but to my surprise, she was as kind and amiable as
she could be. I did not understand it at first, but my sister
told me that she got religion soon after I went away, and
that, since that time, she had governed her temper for the
most part, and was real motherly to them. Well, as I told
you, Mr. Lindsey, I have strong religious instincts, and
often in waking up suddenly in the night, I would tremble
all over to think how my life was flying away and I did not

<!--- vol 2 page 90 -->

know what there was beyond for me. Being tender too, at
this time, thinking of my mother, and meeting my sisters,
and my aunt being so kind to me, and knowing that my
father had cause to be angry with me, made me feel more
upon the subject. Just now I heard that the great revival
preacher, Elder Snow, was in the township, and that a good
many of my old cronies, among the boys and girls, had
obtained a hope. Thinks I, now is the time for me. So
I went to the prayer-meeting in the evening, heard him
preach, saw all my sins pictured out before me just as plain
as you can see the different places on this map. I went to the
anxious seats with the rest, and returned home to pass an
awful night. I saw myself just ready to fall into everlasting
flames, exactly as he painted it. Thinks I to myself,
I can't stand this. If there is help for me in this world or
the next, I must have it. So without saying anything about
it to the folks, I went straight to the preacher.

<p>" 'Elder Snow,' said I, 'I want religion, and must have
it, whether or no.'</p>

<p>" 'Well, my boy,' said he, 'I am the man for you. Do
you believe that you are the wickedest sinner on God's
earth?'</p>

<p>" 'Yes,' said I; 'and what is more, I know it,' for I
really felt so at the time.</p>

<p>" 'Do you feel as if you deserved hell-torments now, and
forevermore?'</p>

<p>" 'Anything that you can name&mdash;and they have begun
with me, I feel them this very minute.'</p>

<p>" 'Do you trust in the merits of Jesus Christ, and that he
is able to save you by his blood?'</p>

<p>" 'I suppose so, as far as I understand. Heaven knows,
I haven't any of my own to boast of, and I'm willing to trust
in anything that will do the business for me.'

<p>" 'Well, my boy, I think you are a special case of God's
grace.'</p>

<p>" 'Can you put me through, do you think?'</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 91 -->

<p>" 'Yes,' said he, 'kneel down, and let us pray.'</p>

<p>"I did as he said. He first took off his coat, rolled up his
shirt-sleeves, and then went at it, and prayed for a full hour
and a half, at the top of his voice. At the end of it, I was
as light as a feather, my sufferings all gone, and I felt that
I was on the highway to the land of Canaan&mdash;beyond the
floods. I went to the conference. Elder Snow told the
assembly, that I was a flaming instance of heavenly grace,
and called upon me to relate my experience, which I did.</p>

<p>"For two weeks, I never enjoyed myself so much in
my life; went to the meetings three times a-day, prayed,
sang, and exhorted, and was made much of by all the
Christians, old and young."</p>

<p>"Well, what was the end of it?"</p>

<p>"The end of it was, that when Elder Snow went away,
my religion seemed to vanish with him. I never have been
able to get up much since, and I feel as if I had been
cheated and imposed upon. I did not fall into the reckless
vices some of my comrades did, but I know well enough,
that I am none too good for this world, much less for the
other one. So that is the history of my religious experience."</p>

<p>"What a strange idea of religion such preachers as you
describe, must have. One would think it was a mantle to
put on and off, instead of being a principle, a sentiment,
and a life. I never heard of a like absurdity."</p>

<p>"Yes, such mistakes have had a most lamentable effect
upon the moral sense of the community at large. It will
take more than one generation to recuperate it to a healthy
evangelical tone," said Mr. Lindsey.</p>

<p>"From what are such ideas derived?" said Zo&euml;. "They
do not get them from the Bible surely?"</p>

<p>"O, no! they are the natural running to seed of the
dogmatism of the past ages, united with the more vital but
extravagant spirit with which Wesley, Whitefield and
others endeavored to galvanize them. These men did a

<!--- vol 2 page 92 -->

great work for Christianity by their fervor and piety, but
they had not reach of mind and simplicity of character
sufficient to lead them to thrust aside all the incrustations
around Christianity, therefore a new reform is necessary.
The world has got to return to the simple teachings of
Christ, casting aside their false philosophies and theologies,
receive, like little children, his unadulterated truths,
and imbibe and imitate the spirit of his life."</p>

<p>"O, yes," said Zo&euml;, "and they are so beautiful, and
speak so plainly and tenderly to the soul, how can men
misunderstand them, or resist their call to the higher life,
embodied in them?"</p>

<p>"Only in Christ has the spirit of his religion been
wholly incarnated. Ever since his death, has it been deteriorated
more or less by human admixtures, concocted by
the darkened intellects and blind passions of men. I look
forward, however, to a better future. My own sect has
thrown aside all the creeds of men's invention, and though
their numbers are apparently in the minority, yet, through
all Christendom, Unitarianism, or the belief in one God
and in Jesus Christ as our great spiritual Leader, has
acted as a powerful leaven to raise the masses to higher
conceptions of religion than the dominant Churches give
them," said Mr. Lindsey.</p>

<p>"I should like to know your belief, for I am as much on
the fence in religious matters, as that young Squire yonder
is in politics."</p>

<p>"I cannot better give you an idea of it, than by saying,
that it is comprised in the precepts and parables of our
Lord, enforced by the spirit of his example and life, recognizing
with awe and gratitude, as I do, the seal he set
upon his heaven-sent mission by dying a martyr's death for
truth and God. These precepts, this holy, pure, loving
and self-sacrificing spirit, it is my aim to embody in my
own life, to set them forth in my Sunday ministrations to
my people, and to develop them in accordance with the

<!--- vol 2 page 93 -->

march of God's Providence, as is seen in nature, history,
and life, making civilization and the highest possible conception
of Christianity one and the same, now and forevermore."</p>

<p>"That is beautiful," said Zo&euml;. "It is my ideal of
Christianity, though I might not be able to express it so
well. Why does not the world see and acknowledge this
beautiful revelation? It is as clear to me as noonday."</p>

<p>"If that is Christianity, why I feel that there is some
hope for me. There is reason in that. But the doctrines
that are preached in the churches that I have attended,
upset nature and common-sense, and would turn the world
into a complete Pandemonium if fully carried out. If you
will believe it, our minister said one day, in answer to
my sister, who referred him to Christ's Sermon on the
Mount for her belief in the essentials of religion, <i>that
Jesus did not go quite far enough there</i>," said Mr.
Stephenson.</p>

<p>"Fortunately the religionists are very inconsistent, seeing
that they cling to a <i>paganized</i> Christianity," said Mr.
Lindsey. "Human nature is very vagarious in its imaginings,
and bad enough sometimes in its perverted manifestations;
but, thank heaven, it recoils from carrying out its most
unnatural and diseased lucubrations into full practice. I
doubt if our dismal friend yonder, though he looks more
like Calvinism embodied than any other one I have yet
seen, would not shrink from many of his opinions, if they
were to be wrought out in the experience of himself or
those dear to him."</p>

<p>"I guess so; but these fellows always contrive to put
themselves on the safe side, when they give out the Almighty's
decrees. They and their children are of the
elect, while we, who don't believe their lies, are among
the goats; they are the ones to look over the battlements
of heaven, while we, who don't come into their traces, are

<!--- vol 2 page 94 -->

down below, gnashing our teeth in the flames. I know
them, inch by inch."</p>

<p>"One of them, a minister, whose child's funeral my
father attended, before the separation between the Orthodox
and the more liberal sects took place, consigned his
own baby, of a year old, to the bad place very coolly,"
said Mr. Lindsey. "He said, while walking home from its
little grave, in answer to some consolatory remark of his
friend, that he 'supposed the little viper deserved to have
its head crushed,' and then added, 'that hell was paved
with infants' skulls not a span long!' "</p>

<p>"Horrible! horrible!" said Zo&euml; and Hilda in the same
breath. "What form of paganism could be more dreadful
in its results?"</p>

<p>"That I call the legitimate working of the Calvinistic
system. Thank heaven, that other influences more often
come in to modify it," said Mr. Lindsey.</p>

<p>"I guess that the Dr. there is of the same stock. Look
at him! I should think he had eaten fever and ague
damps for his breakfast, bilious miasma for his dinner, and
the cholera cramps for his supper all his life."</p>

<p>"Poor man!" said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"I think you deserve, at least, a dessert of those imponderable
miseries for caricaturing him as you do," said
Hilda.</p>

<p>"It is no caricature, and you will see that it is not before
we get rid of him. I know 'em," said Young America.
"I wish he'd tip overboard. I've enough original sin in
me for that. Fool, to think that we are suffering more for
our first grand-dad's fault than for our own, or for our father's
neglect of physiological laws, it may be!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has the notion of the old man with whom
I talked last summer. I spoke to him of what I considered
the absurdity of the doctrine of imputed sin, and he said
that his belief was, that when Adam and Eve ate the apple,

<!--- vol 2 page 95 -->

all the souls of the human race were present and consented
to the deed. I asked him if he remembered the circumstance,
and he said he thought he had a dim recollection
of it!"</p>

<p>The girls laughed at this instance of a retentive memory,
and Stephenson said that he was glad to see that one of
the tribe was consistent.</p>

<p>At that moment a cry was raised that a whale was spouting
in the distance. Dr. Chichester turned to look at it, stepping
back, as he did so, to be free of some obstacles
between it and the sphere of his vision, and was in imminent
danger of falling backward down the gangway.
Young America darted forward, caught him as he began to
totter, and with his strong arm placed him on safe footing
again.</p>

<p>" 'Does your mother know you are out?' " said he. "By
jingo! a little more, and you had been where you would
have seen stars. Take a seat, sir," said he, softening his
voice, as he saw that he was growing faint from the shock.
"I will go and get you a cordial."</p>

<p>So away he went, and in an incredibly short time
returned with wine and water, insisted upon his drinking
some, and attended upon him as if he had been an affectionate
son; and when he was able, gave him his arm to
lean upon as he went to his state-room.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my lad!" said he, as he assisted him to his
couch. "An old man's blessing be on you!"</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsey, Hilda, Zo&euml;, and others ran to offer their
services, but Stephenson was so assiduous that they were
not needed. As the two walked away, Mr. Lindsey said:
"A good heart beats under that rough exterior."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hilda; "we liked him so much when he
was in Copenhagen. His father was minister to that court
when we were very little girls, and his residence was near
Miss Ingemann's school. George staid but one year with
his family, as his parents thought he had better be <i>at home</i>

<!--- vol 2 page 96 -->

at school; but during that time, we became great friends.
I was only eight, and he was sixteen, but he was my favorite
playmate, nevertheless, and was always ready to do
anything for us we wished him to. I never have forgotten
him, though he has changed so much I did not know him
at first. But I find he is as good and funny as ever."</p>

<p>Stephenson now returned to them. "The old gentleman
isn't so bad, after all," said he. "I wish he hadn't gray
hairs, and I would get up an argument with him. I'd
knock his Calvinism into a cocked hat for him, for he is a
deal better than his thunder-and-lightning creed."</p>

<p>Mr. Pierson and his sisters now appeared on the opposite
side of the deck. "There's a <i>big-bug</i>," said he, designating
the former by a side toss of his head, as he seated
himself by Hilda.</p>

<p>"Where, where?" said she, jumping up and brushing
with her hand her neck, upon which one of her ringlets
had fallen.</p>

<p>"That Don over there," said he, "brother to those
young ladies. What frightens you?"</p>

<p>"I thought you meant that there was one on my neck,
and I can't bear insects. Why do you call Mr. Pierson a
bug? <i>I</i> think he is a very elegant young gentleman."</p>

<p>"Elegant enough! so are lady-bugs, but they have got
a pretty considerable of a <i>hum</i> to them. He is one of the
Boston chaps, I reckon. I had as lieve have a regular
John Bull round, and a little rather, for he is genuine,
while this is a counterfeit. I know 'em."</p>

<p>"Have you become acquainted with the young ladies?"</p>

<p>"Not I. They are too <i>uppish</i> for me. Don't they cut a
swath?" said he, as he saw them with their brother walk
backwards and forwards on the deck.</p>

<p>"I wonder what they are thinking of!" said Hilda, as she
saw them looking very serious.</p>

<p>"Solving a problem," said he.</p>

<p>"What problem?" said Zo&euml;. "What do you mean?"</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 97 -->

<p>"O, whether God Almighty made them, or they made
Almighty God!"</p>

<p>"I think you are very irreverent," said Hilda.</p>

<p>"They are to blame for suggesting it to me," said he.
"I know those Boston fellows. They think their little hill
is the head-quarters of creation, and if the universe was
to be destroyed, the most effectual way to begin the work
would be to extinguish one of their <i>first families</i>."</p>

<p>"I thought," said Hilda, "that America was a republic,
and that you were without an aristocracy."</p>

<p>"O no! we have the codfish aristocracy in New York,
the whale-oil aristocracy in New Bedford, the coal-trade
aristocracy in Philadelphia and Baltimore, the rise-of-land-and-pork
aristocracy in Cincinnati, the F. F. V. aristocracy
in Virginia, the cotton aristocracy down South, the literary,
and best family, and fine-mannered aristocracy in Boston,
and in every little one-horse village a six by nine aristocracy,
founded upon whatever comes handiest in the <i>set-up</i>
line. You are very much mistaken, Hilda; we are the
most aristocratic nation on the face of the globe, I'll venture
to say."</p>

<p>"Is it so?" said Zo&euml; to Mr. Lindsey. "I hardly know
how much to believe Mr. Stephenson."</p>

<p>"Yes, in a manner," said he. "Human nature is very
much the same all over the world, and until elevated and
refined by Christianity and a true philosophy, these coarse
and barbaric manifestations will repeat themselves, though
modified more and more by the increasing light of higher
principles. It requires a more elevated tone of character
than exists under our present forms of religion, to see in
its fullness the significance and beauty of the saying of our
Saviour: 'Whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased,
and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.' Until this
heavenly sentiment is incorporated into the soul, there
must be lacking that true dignity of character, which

<!--- vol 2 page 98 -->

seeks not to prop itself up by external demonstrations, in
lieu of that celestial ascendency of spirit imparted by
Christianity."</p>

<p>"I am so glad to hear you say so," said Zo&euml;. "I have
always felt thus, and that is my friend Mrs. Liebenhoff's
idea, but it strengthens my belief in them, to hear the same
truths uttered by you, sir. I have not found them common
among my associates."</p>

<p>"You have not named the over-mastering aristocracy of
our country," said Mr. Lindsey.</p>

<p>"I should like to hear the tip-top one," said young
America. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"The ecclesiastical aristocracy! the Pharisaical pretensions
of the predominant sects over those who differ from them
in creed or expression of their religious sentiments, is but the
same worldly and feudal temper transferred to the future
world as the scene of its monstrous assumption. The spirit
of the age and the common law forbid the penal fire, the
rack and the thumbscrew, so the unsanctified imagination of
religionists revels in the idea, that those whom they cannot
bind here by the chains of their formulas and articles of
belief, forged and drawn up by benighted and tyrannical
minds, shall afford them horrible satisfaction in the future
world, by undergoing the woes of an eternal inquisition.
But the force of the idea is fast dying before the growing
spirit of love and light of truth, and will, in time, like
obscene birds and ravenous beasts be banished from the
earth."</p>

<p>"Do you not think that a great reform is soon to take
place throughout the world?" said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"I do not know that any sudden improvement will be
allowed us. But I believe the age is progressing towards
a more complete realization of Christianity."</p>

<p>"I think," said Zo&euml;, "that there is soon to be a new era
in the world's spiritual advancement, and that the spirit and

<!--- vol 2 page 99 -->

instructions of our Lord will be recognized all over Christendom
as they have never been before. I think I see a
great many signs of it."</p>

<p>"You are a little enthusiastic are you not, my dear
young lady. Let me warn you against fanaticism. I believe
in the advancement of society through Christianity,
most heartily, but I do not know that there is to be any
sudden revolution."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; was silent, and Hilda, as was her wont, drew her
into conversation upon some other subject. The group separated,
and Mr. Lindsey rejoined his friends.</p>

<p>"You do not get acquainted with those young ladies
opposite. Let me introduce them to you," said he to
Emma and Meta Pierson.</p>

<p>"No, I thank you, sir. I don't care to," said the elder
of the sisters.</p>

<p>"You will find them very agreeable. The taller one is
full of vivacity and spirit, and the other, very gentle, refined
and spiritual."</p>

<p>"She is colored, is she not?" said Mr. Pierson.</p>

<p>"I suspect she is. Nevertheless she is a lady."</p>

<p>"I must say, I have not yet surmounted my prejudice
against the hue of the African, sufficiently to put myself
on a level with any one of the race. It may be a weakness.
It is not that I am not opposed to slavery, for I am
truly so," said Emma.</p>

<p>"Young America and Miss Strophel seem to have got
up quite an intimacy," said Meta.</p>

<p>"They are old friends," said Mr. Lindsey, "and formerly
knew each other in Denmark."</p>

<p>"I think she needs some more mature lady-companion
than the one she has," said Mr. Pierson, "I should be very
sorry to see my sisters as free and easy with all sorts of
people as she is."</p>

<p>"She has great frankness of character, and it is liable
to lead her into some imprudence, yet I think that she has

<!--- vol 2 page 100 -->

been essentially well-taught and will not very far overstep
the bounds of propriety."</p>

<p>The young people said no more, but seemed indisposed
to comply with Mr. Lindsey's suggestion, so of
course, he did not press the matter. They were very dear
to him and his wife, with whom they had resided, as they
were orphans, and were all that were left of a once large
family. They were naturally reserved; repeated afflictions
had bound them together very closely, as well as withdrawn
them from a very extended social intercourse. Besides,
they had been brought up under very different influences
from Mr. Lindsey, and were much imbued with the conventional
exclusiveness of the times. If ever justified in
any one, it might be in them, as they possessed all the
qualities which gild the highest life in our country, respectable
parentage, wealth, position, beauty, refined manners,
a high religious tone of character, and a broad intelligence.
That they did not interpret in its whole length and breadth
the spirit of Christianity, Mr. and Mrs. Lindsey attributed
to circumstances, more than to any willful perversity, and
they trusted to time and the events of God's providence, to
bring to a complete flowering, souls whose budding promise
of beauty and excellence of no common order, were
the delight of their childless home, and the joy of their
united hearts.</p>

<p>THUS the time sped on shipboard joyously to Hilda,
with unwonted cheerfulness to Zo&euml;. She had recovered
from her sea-sickness, and was in good health. The tone
of Mr. Lindsey's mind was more congenial with her own,
than any one she had ever met, excepting Mrs. Leibenhoff's.
Young America amused and exhilarated her. And whatever
latent prejudices there might be on the part of the
other passengers against her caste, and color, she, as yet,
was not made cognizant of them. The idea of her peculiar
mission still governed her. The dissatisfaction of
Mr. Stephenson with the prevailing forms of religious belief,
and the hopeful character of Mr. Lindsey's faith,
were, to her, a presage of the triumph of her own life-long
convictions. The skepticism prevalent in America, as well
as Europe, convinced her that the want of a clear conception
of absolute Christian truth, was the vital need of the
world. The consequent lack of enthusiasm and spirit in
carrying out its requisitions, even by its professed disciples,
to say nothing of the actual heathenism of a large
part of the so-called Christendom, pointed, as with a finger
of fire, to her duty and destiny.</p>

<p>The only question was, how should she accomplish it!
and the readiest answer seemed to be, by her pen. So she

<!--- vol 2 page 102 -->

gathered her paper together, and as she leaned over it, in
the stillness of her room, her spirit was hushed to the
quietness of thought, which flowed upon the page like the
clear rivulet from its source among the mountains, reflecting
the hues of the heavens above. No fire of Poesy, no
passionate eloquence possessed her; but it seemed as if
the spirit of Jesus, with which she had ever walked in
reverential communion, had stilled her into submission to
his own pure and sweet-toned elevation. No hosannas
sang she like the multitude, as he entered the scene of his
suffering, which was but the dark prelude to his world-wide
triumph, but a like humble exaltation of spirit was hers, as
she traced the history of God's dealings to his people to the
time of his advent. Then she gathered up the forces of
her soul, and with the trust which comes through communion
with the Highest, condensed his instructions, and represented
his spirit in the persons of a few simple-minded,
holy and earnest beings, such as a young girl would naturally
imagine, who was unused to the world and its many-sided
manifestations, but who was filled more than by anything
else, with the spirit of his character, and the desire
of his glorified reign.</p>

<p>At first she would lay aside her pen, as Hilda approached
her, for she wished no one to come between her own soul
and the Infinite; but as she approached the conclusion of
her work, she yielded to the impulses of her love for her,
and a desire for sympathy, saying nothing, however, of the
deep significance she attached to her Tale. In her heart
of hearts, she treasured the knowledge that its publication
was to be an era in the religion and literature of the nations,
and that through her, the age was to take an unwonted
stride onwards in the path of its advancement. In
the intervals between her writing, she was on deck, drinking
in the soft ocean breeze, and joining with more animation
than ever before, in the varied conversation of the
passengers.</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 103 -->

<p>"I have some engravings that I should like to show you,"
said Mr. Stephenson one morning to Zo&euml; and Hilda. "Let
us go into the saloon as no one is there now."</p>

<p>"I am delighted," said Zo&euml;, who had a true eye for the
beautiful in art as well as nature; so they followed him,
and soon after Mr. Lindsey joined them. They were
not very rare engravings and were soon laid aside by all
but Zo&euml;, whose mind was less critical of the execution of
a work than it was quick to seize upon whatever would
serve as a nucleus, around which her imagination might
weave its subtle web of poetry and fancy. So that with
a child's delight would she recur again and again to any
cheap and ordinary wood-cut, provided it was suggestive
to her. Of course, if it were, at the same time, well
wrought, she enjoyed it proportionally; but the <i>spirit</i> of
any work, either in letters or the arts, was her main object
of search and the natural food of her being.</p>

<p>"There is great expression in some of those pen and
ink drawings," said Mr. Lindsey; "did you trace them?"</p>

<p>"Nobody else, sir," said Young America.

<p>"Do you paint, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, after a fashion. I never have had much instruction,
but it comes sort of naturally to me; so in my vacations
I use the brush a little."</p>

<p>"What department of the art do you prefer?"</p>

<p>"Composition; but I can take portraits, and when I get
tired of the law and like the looks of a fellow pretty well,
I just clap his phiz on to the canvas. I've quite a gallery
at home&mdash;most of them oddities in their way, taken in all
sorts of attitudes and costumes&mdash;one sitting with his chair
tipped back, smoking, with his feet upon the mantlepiece&mdash;
another pretending to be drunk, with a decanter and wine-glass
just slipping from his hand&mdash;another swapping
horses, whittling while he makes the bargain&mdash;and I have
a whole group of fine b'hoys of my acquaintance on a flat-boat
on the Mississippi in a great frolic."</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 104 -->

<p>"A singular taste your friends show, to be taken in
such situations," said Hilda.</p>

<p>"But they are very suggestive, I suppose, of the habits
and tendencies of the young Americans," said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"Yes, in one sense," said Mr. Lindsey. "Our people
have a great deal of love of fun in reality. They have
had so much hard work to do since the settlement of the
country, and asceticism is so much the spirit of the dominant
sects that we are sadly behind-hand in furnishing rational
amusements for them, so that their wit and drollery
leaks out in all sorts of uncouth and extravagant ways in
consequence. The fact is, they have yet to learn how to
entertain themselves in a hearty, yet graceful and rational
manner, so one sees strange manifestations among them.
But I hope that a better taste will spring up in time."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it," said Stephenson; "the preachers condemn
the theatre, preach against dancing, denounce
games of chance and skill, and now they are going to put
down, as a trick of the Devil, calisthenics, that the little
girls find some pleasure and exercise in! I wonder they
don't go out into the woods and fields and put a veto on the
birds singing and the lambs frisking; or read the Assembly's
Catechism to Watch and Fido, if they get up a gambol
together! Confound their fire and brimstone notions that
they are always dealing out to us! If they really <i>believed</i>
what they said, I should not so much care, but to see one
of your young dandy priests, with no blood in him but
milk and water instead, get up, dandling his scented pocket-handkerchief,
and consign to the lower regions all but a
few slim specimens like himself, just for enjoying themselves
a bit in some innocent way, why, I can hardly
keep my hands from pulling his nose for him. I wonder
what color the sun and moon would be if such fellows
made them: dingy-black, I guess&mdash;the same that they are,
outside and inside. I am glad to see that you know how
to laugh, sir," said he to Mr. Lindsey.</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 105 -->

<p>"I have not learned that it was more wicked for the muscles
of the mouth to stretch latitudinally than longitudinally.
Indeed, I think we commit high treason against the good
Father, if we are not cheerful and at peace in his bright and
glorious universe. I reproach myself every time I suffer
a cloud to rest over my spirit; it seems a mark of ingratitude
to Him. O! when will men open their eyes to the
beautiful intentions of God in their creation, and go hand
in hand with Him and Jesus in fulfilling them?"</p>

<p>"How happy we should all be then!" said Zo&euml;. "Earth
would be like heaven at once."</p>

<p>"My sister and I sometimes talk over how we should
like to live," said Mr. Stephenson, "and we have come to
the conclusion that, when I've made money enough, we will
form a community of such people as we like&mdash;put our
business on such a plan that we shan't have to work but
four hours a day to support ourselves, and enjoy life, the rest
of the time, in literary and scientific pursuits, with fun
thrown in as we want it. And we won't have a common-place
person among us. I'm tired of <i>society</i>, as they call
it. I've been in the world enough to see how hollow and
superficial it is. You may spend an evening out, every
day in the week, and ten to one, you don't get a new idea
during the whole time."</p>

<p>"I have not the faith in communities that many have,"
said Mr. Lindsey. "They involve such a multiplicity of
rules, and there is such a complication of interests within
a small space, that, with human nature in its present condition,
they seldom work well long. The Christian principles
and spirit must be manifested in great perfection
among the members, else there will be an unequal distribution
of labor, means, and power, and consequent clashing;
and if there is a thorough appreciation of Christianity,
why then society will need no such total revolution in its
outward arrangements, but all will go on well without it."</p>

<p>"But there is a great deal of waste labor now," said

<!--- vol 2 page 106 -->

Stephenson, "by each family living separate, as it does.
And what is the worst of it, the women have such a hard
time, especially in the new districts, where it is almost
impossible to get help. My eldest sister has a bright mind,
and she would be up to almost anything in the book line,
only that she has to spend most of her time cooking and
drudging in every way for the family."</p>

<p>"I agree that here is a great evil. Still, the family seems
to me such a holy and beautiful institution, and quietness
and seclusion are so sweet to me in my own separate home,
with those most dear to me, after the labors of the day,
that neither I nor my wife would be willing to relinquish
them for the confusion of a monstrous Phalanstery."</p>

<p>"But you might have your separate apartments and be
just as retired as at home."</p>

<p>"Impossible," said Mr. Lindsey. "Then in the education
of children, you would have constantly to struggle
against the influence of an artificial association upon their
young and impressible minds. There is too little individuality
now. Under such circumstances I should fear
their becoming a mass of conglomerates of the same
quality and hue. No, the family is the institution of God
for the development of infancy to its just and beautiful proportions.
There it can be fitly nurtured in the religion of
home, which will prepare it to extend its sympathies, as it
grows older, to other friends&mdash;to the neighborhood, the
church, the city, or hamlet; and from thence to the state,
the country, the world, and to be bounded only by Infinity
itself."</p>

<p>"The system upon which society is founded, seems to
me to be very wrong, now," said Stephenson. "Competition,
not cooperation, is the order of the day. Everybody
looks out for number one; the fellow that can run the fastest
race in business and office, seizes hold of the prizes,
and 'the devil take the hindmost' is the motto. <i>He</i> does
not care, and more likely than not, he gives others a kick

<!--- vol 2 page 107 -->

backwards to prevent their getting up with him. I'm sick
and disgusted with the selfishness of the world. I'll move
into the wilderness, when I get home. I don't want a
human being within twenty miles of me."</p>

<p>"I am very much mistaken, if your nature is not quite
too social to endure life in a hermitage long. But what
you say of the labors of women in the new settlements,
and indeed throughout the country, more or less, among
the middle and poorer classes, is a subject worthy of great
consideration. I wish some methods could be adopted to
relieve them, for the old relations of master, mistress, and
servant seem fast falling into desuetude in our country, and
we must have something better to take their place."</p>

<p>"Communities would do the thing for them. Each one
would have her own allotted part of the labor, and each
would have the advantage of every improvement going, and
leisure to act out her own particular genius. That's the
true way, sir, you may depend upon it."</p>

<p>"I can't relinquish the separate family yet. My wife
has her own notions upon this subject. I should like to
read them to you some time. She writes to me pretty
fully during my absence. I found letters in Mobile for
me from her, and expect others when I get to Jamaica. I
will read you extracts from them some time, if you would
like to hear them."</p>

<p>"O do, sir!" said Zo&euml;. "I should like to know if she
thinks about such things as I do."</p>

<p>"I wish you knew my wife. Miss Carlan. I think you
would suit each other very well."</p>

<p>"Why did she not come with you?" said she.</p>

<p>"She was writing a book, which she was very much interested
in, and she wished to superintend its publication.
Besides, she had spent one winter in the West Indies, and
as I was not ill enough to require her care as an invalid,
she persuaded me to accompany our young friends without

<!--- vol 2 page 108 -->

her. But it is the first time we have been separated, and
half the pleasure of the excursion is lost by the means."</p>

<p>"Are your friends ill?" said Hilda; "they look very
well."</p>

<p>"No, but the New England winter climate is intensely
cold, and Mr. Pierson, who had some tendency to bronchitis,
persuaded his sisters to spend the winter with him in the
tropics, as much for the novelty as for health."</p>

<p>"They look very interesting," said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"They are so," said Mr. Lindsey; "they are highly cultivated
in mind, and their characters have great promise."</p>

<p>"The trouble with him is, he has no boiler aboard," said
young America; "he'll never do anything."</p>

<p>"He has very good executive abilities," said Mr. Lindsey.</p>

<p>"That may be," said he, "but he has no steam&mdash;no
more than half those Boston chaps have. They run to seed
before they are thirty. The difficulty is, they have too
much money; I know 'em."</p>

<p>"Mr. Pierson is not wealthy, though he has a pretty
competence."</p>

<p>"He never will do anything till he gets rid of it, and
that won't be very long, I reckon. These fellows always follow
one another's lead. If one worth a million makes a
great splurge with his money, all the others follow suit,
and that don't do as well for him who has but a few thousands;
they are gone before he knows it&mdash;but it is all the
better for him. Then they have to go to work, and if
there is the real stuff in them, it comes out and they make
something, but not otherwise. My father did not give me
a red cent to begin life with. It has been pretty tough
tugging, I can tell you, but I've weathered the cape, and
now it is plain sailing."</p>

<p>"And you are going to South America?" said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"Yes, my vacation comes in the winter. I had a little

<!--- vol 2 page 109 -->

spare pocket-money and I thought I would just step down
to the valley of the Amazon and see what the 'boys' are
doing. There is a new settlement there, you know. I
shall stay and look round in those parts till half my money
is gone, and then I shall turn my face homewards. I expect
to have rare fun hunting and shooting. I have got my
easel, you see, and I mean to take the heads of some of
the Indians in those diggins. If I like the country and
climate right well, I may perhaps pull up stakes in Iowa
and settle there."</p>

<p>At that moment, Mr. Sarran came in and said, that the
island of Cuba was visible, and they all went on deck.</p>

<p>"Where?" said Hilda; "I don't see it."</p>

<p>"Don't you see that high mountain, that looks almost
like a cloud?"</p>

<p>"O yes, look, Zo&euml;!"</p>

<p>"O, there are the tops of the palm-trees!" she exclaimed.
"They look as if they were growing out of the water.
My beautiful palm-trees! my waving cocoa-nut palm-trees!
how happy and joyful I am to see you again," and she
clasped her hands upon her breast, and the tears gushed
to her eyes. Seeing that she had excited the observations
of the by-standers, she went to her state-room to give full
vent to her passionate emotions.</p>

<p>"Miss Carlan shows real feeling," said Meta Pierson.
"Mr. Lindsey says she has cultivation and poetic sensibility."</p>

<p>"Poor thing!" said Emma. "I am afraid they will not
be of much service to her. I do not believe she will associate
with the whites much, when she gets home."</p>

<p>"No," said her brother; "of course not. It is no kindness
to educate one of her class. It only makes her
more sensible of her inferiority, and increases her sufferings.
Strange, the colored people don't see this, and be
contented in their own condition."</p>

<p>The steam-ship arrived off Havanna, and was met by a

<!--- vol 2 page 110 -->

boat from shore, manned by the officers of health of the
city, with inquiries, at what port they last touched; and
when informed that it was Mobile, the passengers and
crew were forbidden to land, as it was known that cholera
existed in that city, and the Spaniards were afraid of infection.
There was great grumbling and discontent on
board, as a few individuals were intending to spend the
winter there; but rather than submit to a fortnight's quarantine,
they decided to go on to some more southern
island. All were very much interested with the view of
the city; its Moro, the governor's palace, its cathedral and
churches, and the cheerful light-blue and salmon and
pink colors of its dwelling-houses, surmounted by terra-cotta
vases, containing often some small tree or shrub growing,
and at a distance, having the appearance of turrets. Letters
and papers were exchanged between the ship and the
officer on the boat, although they took the precaution of
receiving them on the point of a long sharp instrument,
and smoking them well before daring to touch them with
their hands. The Americans laughed at this extraordinary
caution, and as they steamed away from the harbor,
threw out many an indignant fling at what they considered
an old womanish timidity and whim.</p>

<p>Stephenson said, that he would not land among such a
set of cowards, if he could. Hilda was saucy enough to
repeat the old adage&mdash;"sour grapes," to him; but he
made the rejoinder, that he should join the next filibustering
expedition, and take Cuba and carry it home in his
coat-pocket to use as a sugar box, and set up the Hidalgos
as ten pins upon his bowling alley, and by that time,
he guessed, they would find out that young America was
up to snuff.</p>

<p>As Mr. Stephenson and Hilda were leaning over the
guards, talking and laughing, while they watched the receding
island of Cuba, Mr. Chichester joined them.</p>

<p>"Young man," said he, "I can't help thinking of your

<!--- vol 2 page 111 -->

kindness to me the other day, when I came so near losing
my life, as I should in all likelihood have done, had it not
have been for you."</p>

<p>"O never mind, it was nothing to speak of. A little
more, and you <i>would</i> have kicked the bucket though. I
hope you will be more cautious next time where you step,
sir. It is no joke for a man of your years to get a tumble
head over heels."</p>

<p>"I've been moved, I say, to try and do something for you
in return. I always feel a desire to, as it is my office,
under God, to win souls to Christ; and I feel an earnest
longing that your feet may be planted on the highway to
Zion."</p>

<p>Young America looked at Hilda, who turned from him
for fear he would tempt her to laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, stranger, I rather guess we are on the way there,
by the direction of the vessel. Rather slow rate we go at,
I confess. Confound this clumsy British craft; give me a
Yankee steamer, I say, that'll cut the water at the rate of
fifteen miles the hour. There would be some hope of
getting there then."</p>

<p>"You mistake me, my friend. It was of your soul's
interest, I wished to speak. Have you ever had a change
of heart?"</p>

<p>"O yes, lots of times, it changes once or twice every
day. What do you think it is made of? I ain't a granite
boulder."</p>

<p>"But do you feel that you have an interest in Christ?"</p>

<p>"That I can't tell you, stranger. Those that know him
better than I do, say that I ought to invest capital in that
bank, that it is a very safe one; but I ain't much acquainted
with him myself."</p>

<p>"But you know that your eternal salvation rests upon his
vicarious atonement?"</p>

<p>"As long as we are on Scripture subjects, hadn't we

<!--- vol 2 page 112 -->

better stick to Scripture truth? I know nothing about your
<i>vicarious</i> atonement. It is not in my Bible any-how; and
mine is one of the genuine sort, I reckon. My mother
gave it to me on her death-bed."</p>

<p>"I fear you sadly neglect the interests of your soul,
young man. O, be warned to put your trust in the blood
of Christ. He only can wash white your guilty stains."</p>

<p>"When I can see my way clear to believe in your Pagan
mode of salvation, I'll try my best to do so; but if I remember
right, my Book tells me to love the God that is
anything but the cruel tyrant you set up for us; my neighbor,
that, according to Jesus, is worth loving, instead of being
the monster you paint him; and do all the good I can
in the world. As for Jesus Christ, I like the way he says
he is going to save me, better than your new-fangled one.
I'll stick to him if the time comes that I'm pious enough
to. I don't intend to be impudent, sir, but as you make
pretty free with my private concerns, I suppose you want a
plain answer to your questions."</p>

<p>"I fear you trust in the filthy rags of your own righteousness!"</p>

<p>"There you are entirely out of your soundings. I never
set up for a saint yet, whatever others might do. But there
is one thing, old gentleman, I never expect to get to heaven
without some. And I'll be so bold as to give you a caution,
stranger. There ain't so much goodness in the world,
that you need to decry morality as you preachers do.
Many a fellow, to my knowledge, is on the high-road to
ruin from good works being put down to zero. We are
afloat, entirely, by your telling us in one breath that we
can't do anything for our own salvation, till a miracle is
wrought in us; and in the next, sending us to the bad
place for not accomplishing everything in the godly line.
What sort of consistency is that, I wonder!"</p>

<p>Dr. Chichester shook his head, and walked away, evidently

<!--- vol 2 page 113 -->

thinking that Stephenson's was a doomed case. He
turned, after going a few steps from him, saying: "I shall
pray for you, young man."</p>

<p>"That's right, stranger. If I was much used to the business
of late, I would do the same by you. As it is, I am
afraid my ticket would not forward you on the lightning
train to Canaan."</p>

<p>"I was afraid he would begin to question me," said
Hilda, "and although I am very frank, too unreserved,
Miss Ingemann used to tell me, I must say it would disturb
me very much to have my most sacred feelings pried
into in that way."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Stephenson, "according to them, human
souls must be put into the hopper of a regular grist-mill&mdash;and
there is a great hue and cry if every one does not
come out of it pretty much alike; labeled, 'Good for the
New Jerusalem&mdash;this side up,' but without the care, mind
you."</p>

<p>"I don't know what Zo&euml; would say to it," said Hilda,
"with her delicacy and reserve. I am glad she is not
here."</p>

<p>"You are as fond of each other as when you were little
girls," said Stephenson.</p>

<p>"A great deal more so," said Hilda. "As we grow
older we see in one another what the other lacks, and love
and confide in each other accordingly."</p>

<p>"She is the only colored person I could ever tolerate,"
said Young America. "But somehow she never seems to
me to have the negro taint."</p>

<p>"What an unreasonable prejudice your people have
against the Africans," said Hilda; "it is incomprehensible
to me."</p>

<p>"It is natural. The whites and blacks never can live
together. I wish the slaves were free; but I would have
every soul of them quit the country. We don't want them
in the Northern States. I can't bear the sight of a nigger."</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 114 -->

<p>Hilda felt wounded by this speech, but said nothing, yet
pondered in her mind with anxiety and dread what the
probable fate of Zo&euml; would be in the coarse, superficial,
misjudging world, and went down to her friend's state-room
to lavish upon her the caresses which, as her fears for her
increased, were multiplied in number and fervor.</p>

<p>"WHAT sketch are you taking?" said Hilda to Mr.
Stephenson one morning, as she saw him sitting at his
easel when she came on deck.</p>

<p>"Just the people hereabouts," said he. "I am trying
to get a likeness of Mr. Lindsey in the foreground. The
old Doctor will be thrown in for a shadow to bring him out
in better relief. I want you and Zo&euml; to be sitting together,
she leaning on your shoulder for the fancy part, and the
Don and his sisters will do for the quality, you know. I
shall make quite a master-piece of it, I reckon."</p>

<p>"Have you picture-galleries in America?"</p>

<p>"Not to speak of. They give artists precious little encouragement
up our way. The fact is, we don't care for
much yet, but making money and getting a good living."</p>

<p>"There is great improvement, however," said Mr. Lindsey.
"Picture-shops are multiplying among us, and young
painters are starting up on every side, and there are embryo
galleries in almost every large city. They only need culture
and time to develop the latent genius, which they
really possess."</p>

<p>"The great difficulty with our painters is," said Mr.
Pierson, "that they are not patient and persevering in
their studies. They need to copy the best masters and be
willing to give up their crude pretensions. The fact is,
our artists think they know too much ever to make much

<!--- vol 2 page 116 -->

progress. Even if they go to Europe, they come back,
saying, that they did not see much of value there, so they
soon fall into a crude mannerism, and either degenerate or
remain in a condition of mediocrity."</p>

<p>"I know that is the truth with regard to numbers of
them; but there are some honorable exceptions. There
are some young men from my own city who are doing
much honor to themselves in the Dusseldorf school. Several
beautifully finished landscapes have been sent home
by them as trophies of success in this department of the
Art."</p>

<p>"I don't think much of the Dusseldorf gallery myself,"
said Mr. Stephenson. "If you want to cramp American
genius and inflict upon us a set of mannerists, send the boys
there. If you want to develop American genius in its
own legitimate way, let them stay away from the musty
European galleries, and the old world tyrants, who think
nothing can be done but to copy them."</p>

<p>"And you would neglect the wealth of genius of all
past times, from the vain notion of the necessary supremacy
of our new giant country in everything, would you?" said
Mr. Pierson. "It is this miserable assumption that prevents
our rising in the department of high Art."</p>

<p>"I disagree with you in toto. It is in this very thing
that we forget that we are the western giants, but consent
to be spaniels to crouch to those who by their tyranny have
frightened us into the belief that they and theirs have
exhausted the genius of all creation. Throw them overboard,
I say, and begin anew. We'll show them how the
thing is to be done. We'll paint landscapes that have some
life to them, not like those dead, gray things from the
school over the water, in which God's sunlight is all
squeezed out of them; and faces that have some soul, not
those mere flesh and blood saints of the ancient masters."</p>

<p>"And the divine Madonnas of Raphael you designate
thus, do you? and the celestial Murillos?"</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 117 -->

<p>"Yes, I do; were not they Raphael's mistresses, who
sat to him for the 'Holy Mother?' How could you expect
from such models a spiritual expression, I should like to
know? I never have been able to see any. I could pick
out twenty women of my acquaintance, who would make
better Madonnas than his are. As for the Spaniard's, I
have seen copies of his, and they are neither angels nor
women, but a sort of cloudy, misty, Castilian go-betweens.
I would not give a picayune for the whole lot."</p>

<p>Mr. Pierson walked away, thinking it waste time to parley
longer with such a Vandal, and Stephenson continued:</p>

<p>"The idea of leaving our glorious western sunsets,
which one would think God had tipped his whole box of
colors over, to go to Italy to rave about scenery and skies!
The truth is, these upstarts never looked at one of our own
sunsets enough to know what it is; so when they see a
decent one over there, they make a great fuss about it.</p>

<p>"I'll show them what a sunset and a sunrise, too, is,
when I've practised a little more. I'll put in the tints.
O won't it be beautiful, beautiful!" said he slowly pronouncing
the words, as if too luscious to be abandoned,
and moving his brush in the air, as if painting, his clear
gray eye, meantime, lighting up with an expression of
genius, toning down all the coarseness of his face to one
of beauty, and refinement, and high-spirit combined.
"What do you think, Mr. Lindsey?"</p>

<p>"That you are very extravagant in your Americanism. I
allow too, that my friend, Horace, having been in Europe
just enough to taste the beauty of its artistic life, without
encountering its evils much, sees everything there <i>couleur
de rose</i>, without appreciating at their full value our own
opportunities of working out for ourselves a more exalted
life in Art, no less than in practical life. But if we ever
accomplish a higher destiny in this respect, it will be by
assimilating to ourselves the best spirit of the ancients,
and indeed of all times, in order to reproduce a grander,

<!--- vol 2 page 118 -->

tenderer, and in short, a more Christian phase of civilization
in this regard."</p>

<p>"Would you have all our best young men go to Europe,
then, to spend their lives, copying the models in the
Louvre? You won't catch me to do it, sir, if I can ever
get money enough to give up the law."</p>

<p>"By no means. I will agree with you so far as to say,
that I should wish no men or women to cross the ocean,
until their souls are sufficiently awakened to the idea of
God's great designs in opening our continent to the nations,
as to feel that the opportunity awarded them to do so was
a great trust, so that instead of aimlessly flitting from one
time-hallowed city to another, imbibing their vices and
bringing home nothing but discontent and disease of body
and mind, they might, like the bountiful earth, receive the
good seed to give out a harvest, of not the identical grain,
but fourfold more in a newer, richer, and diviner form."</p>

<p>"I will agree to that, if they will but do it; but the
trouble is, they don't. Another evil is, artists have to
struggle along without help and a cheering word, now and
then, till they get discouraged. Many a young fellow,
whom I know, would do wonders in his line, if he could
only be encouraged. The money bags are in the wrong
hands, according to my reckoning. They get possession
of it, who either hoard it, or use it for mean objects, so that
Art is kept in the background."</p>

<p>"All very true. There is lamentable lack of public
spirit, no less than of private benevolence among us,
judged by the highest rule, but you should at least give
credit for what there is. I have no sympathy with the misanthropy
which besets some of our young men. It is a
proof of lack of power, no less than of an ungrateful
spirit. Then, again, though there should be sympathy and
readiness to cheer artists in every judicious way, yet if

they must <i>live</i> in the true sense of that word. Every one,

to be a genuine man or woman either, has got to work out
his or her own salvation in the deepest and highest sense
of that injunction."</p>

<p>"I guess you would think some fellows of my acquaintance
have a pretty smart chance at that same thing, if you
knew the hard scratching they have to keep the wolf of poverty
and starvation from the door. Confound the world, and
most of the people in it! If I thought that Symmes' Hole
was really open, as he said, I'd cut for the jumping-off
place at once."</p>

<p>"How do you know you would find better friends there
than here?" said Hilda. "I advise you to stay above
ground and make the best of us all."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Liebenhoff would say&mdash;'We women will set all
things right,' " said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"No, that is the worst of it," said Young America. "In
our place they have undertaken to open a gallery of pictures.
Now, I don't, like some of my comrades, make fun
of the whole matter, simply because it is a woman's plan,
I am willing she should take the position she can fill and
do whatever she is capable of doing well."</p>

<p>"Provided she does not come into conflict with you,"
said Hilda, with a sly look at Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"Well, it's something so. I'll acknowledge the corn.
I was going to say, that instead of filling their gallery with
native pictures, they have sent off to Europe and got
some of those pagan divinities over there, in the shape of
casts, and imported some copies of the old masters, they
call them, of the color of shoe-leather, and filled most of
the other spaces with pictures after the style of the scarlet
woman. Ha, ha, ha! Good for the ladies, I say. I hope
they enjoy them! You won't catch us to go and see them,
except to laugh at the copies. Who cares anything for a
<i>copy</i>, I should like to know? You can't learn anything from
a <i>copy</i>. Give me originals, I say, and by our own artists
too."</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 120 -->

<p>"I suspect, the ladies in your place have very much such
a gallery as they have in the Queen City. I must read my
wife's musings therein. She seems to find 'copies' and
casts of pagan divinities quite suggestive."</p>

<p>"O do, please," said Zo&euml; and Hilda in one breath.</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsey went for his portfolio and took from it a
letter, and read this extract:</p>

<p>"Our Picture Gallery is at length opened, quite to our
satisfaction. Its situation is very good&mdash;an apartment back
of Mr. Weld's picture store, which makes a very agreeable
entrance. The young proprietors are very gentlemanly
and obliging, and the ladies prompt in sending in contributions
from their own collections of paintings. We anticipate
much pleasure ourselves from an occasional resort
there, and hope it will prove an acceptable addition to the
scanty sources of refined recreation with which our city
is furnished. After my last visit to it, I sat down and
wrote the following, which I send you:</p>

thy great white throne, whence beams thy clear effulgence.
Rend the vault above me, and reveal thy purposes. I have
called thee Father, and have taught the dear and hallowed
name to my disciples. Have I deceived myself? I have
poured out my love, a sea filled from no earthly source, I
deemed, upon the world's struggling, suffering, wearied and
diseased ones, and all save a few, have passed me coldly
by. I have given them of Thy truth, from a well whose

give them more than life, and they have scarce paused to
sip even its sparkling foam. The healing that abides in

heal the corporal ills of man; the music of my voice,

<p>MR. LINDSEY reads to
the group on shipboard, the following
article, from the <i>Herald of
Freedom</i>, written by a friend of his
wife.</p>

<p>"In view of the severe labors
of the gentlemen of the Queen
City, necessarily preventing them
from attending to the remedy of
some of its existing evils, and bringing
out its great capabilities for a
pleasant and beautiful residence,
the ladies of the same met together, to devise measures
by which these objects could be effected. After all due

<!--- vol 2 page 132 -->

preliminaries, Mrs. Lumkins being elected President pro
tem., they proceeded to business. It is unnecessary to relate,
even the very brief discussions which took place, so I
will simply record the almost unanimous decisions of the
meeting.</p>

<p>" '<i>Voted</i>.&mdash;That a Committee of Ladies be chosen to
sweep and thoroughly cleanse the streets of the city in
every part, and adopt such measures as may seem best to
them for its continued purification.</p>

<p>" '<i>Voted</i>.&mdash;That money be cheerfully and abundantly
raised to liquidate every church debt within its boundaries.</p>

<p>" '<i>Voted</i>.&mdash;That the church edifices which are in need of
repair shall either be completely re-arranged and beautified,
or else pulled down, and new, stable, and fitting
structures erected in their stead.</p>

<p>" '<i>Voted</i>.&mdash;That all the public buildings in the process of
erection shall be completed forthwith, with as honest and
careful regard to Uncle Sam's money used for the purpose,
as if it were the individual property of the builders.</p>

<p>" '<i>Voted</i>.&mdash;That all the buildings on a certain well-known
square, excepting the single one which by right belongs
there, shall be pulled down and the rubbish removed for a
Park to be arranged for the use of <i>the city</i> to whom it of
right belongs.'</p>

<p>"There was some discussion upon this point, and it was
at length decided, that as the quantity of material strewn
around the neighborhood by the destruction of so many
large establishments would put to serious inconvenience
the ladies as they promenaded the street, it was better to
decide that public opinion should demand the full value
of the property to purchase some tract of woodland in the
neighborhood of the city, which was to be immediately
fenced and laid out in walks for the aforesaid purpose.
With regard to the propriety of the measure there was no
dissenting voice; justice to the defrauded and the eternal
safety of its present holders demanded the sacrifice.</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 133 -->

<p>" '<i>Voted</i>.&mdash;That a large tract of land in the Millcreek
Valley be also purchased for a similar purpose.</p>

<p>" '<i>Voted</i>.&mdash;To see that the poor, who demand charity
during the coming winter, be provided with working implements,
and directed by a committee of ladies to raise the
aforesaid land to a proper level by means of soil carted on;
and fenced, and beautified for the purpose.</p>

<p>" '<i>Voted</i>.&mdash;That another committee of ladies be appointed
to communicate with the surrounding country for the purpose
of finding suitable homes for poor women and young
girls, who may apply for charity to the Relief Union, thereby
putting it in their power to gain an honorable independence,
instead of ruinously relying on the charity of the
community.</p>

<p>" '<i>Voted</i>.&mdash;That a vigilance society be appointed for the
purpose of protecting the property of strangers, especially
emigrants, from the loss of their baggage by means of the
carelessness or dishonesty of our public conveyances.</p>

<p>" '<i>Voted</i>.&mdash;That methods be devised by which the disgusting
effluvia, issuing from our pork establishments,
soap, and lard manufactories, and limekilns, be completely
remedied.</p>

<p>" '<i>Voted</i>.&mdash;That large gas establishments be erected in
the vicinity of the city, by which the coal now consumed
in its crude state, may be converted into this element for
the purpose not only of lighting, but heating manufactories,
stores, public buildings, dwelling-houses, etc., etc., thereby
removing, in a great measure, the nuisance of the smoky
atmosphere from our midst.</p>

<p>" '<i>Voted</i>.&mdash;That stationary engines be erected on the
levee to draw up burdens from the steam, coal, and wood-boats,
and rafts, and thus relieve the horses which are now
shamefully abused by being overloaded.</p>

<p>" '<i>Voted</i>.&mdash;That the present temperance law be fully
carried into practice throughout the city, thus shielding

<!--- vol 2 page 134 -->

fathers, husbands, brothers, and sons from a fruitful source
of misery and guilt.</p>

<p>" '<i>Voted</i>.&mdash;That as most of the men and many of the
women of the city have become raving crazy by the prevalent
miasma of worldliness, and as the ladies of the assembly
have so much care and labor in consequence upon
their hands, as to make it impossible for them to provide
strait-jackets for the multitude, that each one of them
should petition daily to our good Lord, that he have them
in his holy care and keeping until their recovery. Then,
if they choose to take their own work into their hands and
do it efficiently and promptly, why, very well! <i>But it has
got to be done!</i> and if they neglect it, we will immediately
band ourselves into an army of Amazons, the fourth body
of that name and character since the creation, and leave
them to delve in their warehouses and banks sixteen hours
per day, preparing for another <i>crash</i>, the consequence of
their ignorance of the true laws of labor as well as those
of commercial supply and demand of the world in which
they exist.'</p>

<p>"These few items will give the spirit of the meeting.
Many other reforms were decided upon, but we will
defer the publication of them until a more convenient
season.</p>

<p>"Two of the ladies proposed an adjourned meeting to
reconsider these resolutions; but as both were under unfortunate
antediluvian influences at home, and the resolutions
otherwise were entirely unanimous, after politely listening
to their objections, the vote was passed in the affirmative,
and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>"The next morning the committee appointed met and
arranged the different parts of the city into districts, with
a view to its complete purification. The President made
out the report of each one's duty in this wise:</p>

<p>" 'High up on Willow street there dwelleth one, brave in

<!--- vol 2 page 135 -->

the cause of virtue, faithful in works of charity. She will,
with her mighty besom, purge her precincts of all corruption,
even as far as the home for orphans. Lead out that
many-numbered band, ye foster mothers, each with her
little spade, and make the air pure and healthful to nurture
them to a higher type of womanhood than their progenitors,
mayhap, have given them for inheritance.</p>

<p>" 'The portion of the city where dwelleth your Moderator,
shall be given into the care of her Lottie, a child of
but few summers, it is true, but so fond of rule and supervision
that the humble precincts of her home but dwarf her
energies. She and her numerous mates, which swarm
around, will do well the work, while her gentle friend the
<i>Copyist</i>, will hint to her when she oversteps a democratic
governance, and note, with tasteful eye, if 'well done'
shall be the sentence for her reward.</p>

<p>" 'All around the Park and farther east, shall be consigned
to two who have been noted for an energy, quiet, but
none the less effective. One is the sister-mother in a home
with a sign of the 'infant angel' over its second story window.
If the little one's wings chance to need brushing at
the proper hour for labor, why, let the namesake of a most
lovely damsel of olden time, who was not ashamed to draw
the water for her father's herds, be her willing substitute.
Who knows but she may find some generous stranger by
the means, with jewels rare to adorn her neck and arms,
and whisper to her of a home among her father's kinsfolk
far away?</p>

<p>" 'She need not work alone, for one with an ever-smiling
face and brilliant eye, but a few steps onwards, will leave
her little one in the care of her young brothers and wield
well the broom and shovel, and no lack of merry jokes and
cheerful chat will be there to while away the hour of
labor.</p>

<p>" 'A little south and farther west, she who believes in the

<!--- vol 2 page 136 -->

enlargement of woman's sphere, will gladly, with her
handmaiden, do the part allotted her in the regeneration of
our city.</p>

<p>" 'Next comes a maid of order and decision, with too
much pride to tolerate the refuse of the market near her
door, so, though not so pleasant to arrange as 'the feast of
reason and the flow of soul' in books, yet for the sake of
duty and the weal of the community, she will adorn the
highway instead.</p>

<p>" 'But where are Minna and Brenda? I met them not
lang syne, their lower persons enveloped in purple clouds,
with an inverted rainbow from the waist upward, their
mourning for the sea-king defied. Will they not aid to
sweep our streets? They may choose where it suits them
best. It may be that some gallant (I know not) will aid
them in their labor, ashamed to see the maidens thus employed.
Let them thus try the chivalry of our Urban
Knights.</p>

<p>" 'And there is a matron, a friend, it may be, of their
own, magnificent and stately; will she not do it with a
grace? Even the stars might be excused if they peeped
from their hiding-places at unwonted hours, as with vailed
face she sweeps along the streets. Was ever city-soil thus
honored? I ween not.</p>

<p>" 'Mother judicious and gentle, who hath a sense of
beauty beaming from thy soul! thy little ones so carefully
trained may be intrusted to themselves an hour, whilst
thou and thy companion-daughter, over whom a shadow
hath fallen in her dew of youth, step forth with brush in
hand to remove the slightest stigma from the stones about
thy mansion.</p>

<p>" 'And one of many eyes and thoughts for others! if I
knew not she shrank from notice of her deeds, I would say
that, after a careful memory of the wishes of her friends
by day, and pleasures artistic during the hours of evening,

<!--- vol 2 page 137 -->

she might steal for half an hour to the pavements to renew
the boulders' tints, and, perhaps, reset what are awry, so as
to better please the eye by their arrangement.</p>

<p>" 'That young girl's school towards the setting sun must
calisthenics practice. Here is a new kind with great improvements.
Brave teacher, marshal them in order for the
amusement, for such we will call it, and we will see who
most doth honor herself and her instructors by her zeal in
our behalf.</p>

<p>" 'On Damson-street there will be no lack of faithful
laborers, though sorry I am that one is absent, whose
growing purity and loveliness brooks not the least taint
within the soul, or in its outward garments.</p>

<p>" 'But our Fidelit&eacute; will do well her share, for she has had
no lack of training or practice in the work of life. The
wee brothers, a numerous band, will aid her, and thus
repay the cares, by day and night, of those who hover over
them, almost with the love of her who plumed her wings
and mounted to the heavenly sphere, to make ready a mansion
for her numerous brood hereafter.</p>

<p>" 'The Minstrels opposite, must sweep a broad space
around them; so many seraphs, hereabouts, claim the
young matrons' time and thoughts. Let them sing merrily
as they go, cheering their own labor; and, at the same time,
by their clear melody, hushing each troubled dream of the
tender ones not used, as yet, to the lower world's rude ways.</p>

<p>" 'Two mothers I well wot of, farther on a little north,
will, for the sake of the children's play-hours, safety and
pleasure, make pure their neighborhood. No mountain
will the labor be to them, but simply a thing by-and-by; a
recreation in the intervals of their many household labors.</p>

<p>" 'We will excuse the matron the next below, for she has
delved fully her share of work for the public weal in days
gone by.</p>

<p>" 'Tread lightly by the mansion high above the street, enveloped
by odor of honeysuckle, sweetbrier and roses, for

<!--- vol 2 page 138 -->

the proprietress must be laid safely away, for a time, to
rest, else she will fail when all who sorrow or sicken
come to her for relief and aid. So we will lay our orders
upon the young mother opposite, who, with her stalwart
baby, will brighten up the highway, that it may reflect the
sunshine all over her dwelling, making it cheerful, healthful,
and beautiful.</p>

<p>" 'Opposite, on the lower street, is another who will descend
to do her part; and thus we will go on and on, until
we find the mother and daughter who will complete the
remainder of the city cleaning, ay, and rejoice in the labor
too. Good for the ladies! that those can be found among
them who from no greed of pelf, but from artistic love,
engage to keep our city pure and free from all defilement,
the first condition to a healthful tone of public morals, and
pure advancement in the soul's true life.' "

<p>"DELIVER me from <i>strong-minded</i>
women, I say," said Young
America; "it is the only one of the
species I won't give my seat up to,
in a crowd. There is nothing I like
better than to wait upon a <i>lady</i>.
But if they choose to be men, let
them take their chance with men,
and rough it as they do."</p>

<p>"I thought," said Hilda, "you
were willing to let them take any
position that they can well fill, and
yet the moment they attempt to, you scorn their proceedings.
Not that I care much about the subject; I have

<!--- vol 2 page 140 -->

always acted pretty much as I choose, as yet, and I am
sure I do not wish to sweep the city streets; I can enjoy
myself much better in other ways"&mdash;and she turned to a
sketch she was taking of a ship not very distant, with its
sails fully set.</p>

<p>"There have always been foolish women who have insisted
upon unsexing themselves," said Mr. Pierson; "and
there always will be, I suppose. But a true woman understands
that her sphere is in her home. Only there, does
she shine out in her fullest grace and loveliness; and only
in feminine pursuits can she be ever attractive to us."</p>

<p>"Which of course, is to be the chief end and aim of
woman," said his sister Meta, a little sarcastically.</p>

<p>"There must be a higher order of young men than the
majority of those on the stage, if you expect women to fill
their life in administering to their happiness and delight.
They may be very proper and worthy, but there is not that
in them to awaken enthusiasm, or retain it if once excited."</p>

<p>"There is evidently a change coming over their fortunes,"
said Mr. Lindsey. "Feminine women, of course,
we would have, but the signs of the times show that the
sphere of pursuits included within the term feminine, is
to be enlarged. As for their taking upon themselves those
of an opposite character, if man wishes to prevent it, he
must arouse to a greater and stronger style of action, and
go forward himself in all noble enterprises. Until he does
so, you may be sure there will be plenty of instances of
women departing from their own sphere."</p>

<p>"Come, Hilda," said Stephenson, "let's play a game
of backgammon."</p>

<p>They went apart a little and were soon deep, not so
much in the game as in free and lively chat. Hilda was
frank, social and excitable, and she put but little restraint
upon herself in conversation with any one. Young America
had sufficient respect for women in general, and her in particular,
to shun any coarse vulgarity; yet he had no very

<!--- vol 2 page 141 -->

deep conviction of the value of human nature in itself or as
developed in a pure woman's soul. The instinct of its
worth was lying in him in a state to be easily acted upon,
but as yet Hilda had shown him only the surface of her
character, and she was to him like a beautiful plaything,
which every day he sought more and more to please himself
with. She was enlivened and amused by his quaintness,
and his extravagances kept her perpetually laughing.
Added to these, there were constantly shining out from his
character gleams of genius and taste, though as yet quite
untrained. Then he was generous and frank, and she
delighted more and more in his society. This was very
evident to him, and it elated him so, that he never was so
prodigal of his eccentricities as when t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with her,
or with Zo&euml; sitting near, whom he liked to startle from her
reverie and make her really, heartily laugh.</p>

<p>"What a lovely day it is!" said Hilda. "I never felt
such a delicious air."</p>

<p>"Yes, I sent last evening to the clerk of the weather,
on the top of the Rocky Mountains, for just such a day as
this, and you see we've got it."</p>

<p>"Order a storm, do," said Hilda; "if you have such
influence, I should like to see the ocean in its sublimity."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't dare to. Women change their minds so
suddenly, that in sending it back, as I should have to, the
contrary winds would make a tornado which would swamp
us all." Hilda laughed. "It is your turn to move."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, besides hunt and sketch,
when you are in South America?"</p>

<p>"O, make love-knots of the boa-constrictors to send to
the lady I like best!"</p>

<p>"I hope you will send her a good strong bureau, with a
lock on it, to keep them in. What next?"</p>

<p>"Help the boys dam up the Amazon to carry on our
grist-mill with!"</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 142 -->

<p>"I am afraid you won't sketch much," said Zo&euml;, "if you
attempt such mighty works as that. I have been depending
upon seeing your portfolio when you come to Santa
Cruz, as you say you will."</p>

<p>"The sketching I am going to set the sun to do, in
regular new-fashioned style, not through your miserable
daguerreotypes, and if the old fellow don't put in the warm
colors good, why, I'll just call in a streak of lightning
to help him."</p>

<p>"I read to-day in the newspaper, that a petrifaction was
found somewhere, which had a distinct impression of the
surrounding scenery upon it, probably given it by a flash
of electricity."</p>

<p>"Lor, yes! that is no news. Didn't it take its lessons
of me? The old governor never liked my pupil, for he
was afraid of his hay-crop nicely packed away in the barn.
So I used to go and give it to him in the very middle of the
darkest thunder-cloud you ever saw."</p>

<p>"I should think there would have been a scarcity of
light, when he got so deep in his lesson as to forget to
flash," said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"Yes, there was at first, until I caught Sirius, as he was
whirling by, and stuck him into my inkstand, just as you
would a tallow candle into a turnip, and he answered my
purpose exactly, for I did not have to stop every three
minutes to snuff him. By the way, Hilda, I've got an elegant
wreath for your head, made out of a part of that same
lightning streak, and you shall have it to wear at your next
party. The piece that was left of it, I made into a walking-stick,
and, as it was rather hot for my hand, I topped
it off with a slice of one of the icebergs that wall up
Polonia."</p>

<p>"Thank you!" said Hilda. "I shall create a sensation
with my new head-dress, surely. But what have you got
for Zo&euml;?"</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 143 -->

<p>"I am waiting till we get into more southern latitudes,
and then I am going to steal the Southern Cross. It won't
be missed much, I reckon, and she may have that to wear
round her neck."</p>

<p>"But she will want a chain to hang it on."</p>

<p>"I have got one all ready for her. As I was riding
through Franconia Notch, among our White Mountains,
you know, I just scooped up that crystal waterfall by the
roadside, and I have got ever so many strings of beads
made from it. She shall have one of them."</p>

<p>"I am afraid it would not become my dusky face," said
Zo&euml;. "My taste is like Mrs. Liebenhoff's in this respect.
I like pearls. Have you any of them?"</p>

<p>"I shall have lots of them, if you will only wait six
months. As I sailed down the Ohio, I ordered the shell-fish
to make a cartload for me of different sizes, and they
fairly jumped out of the water for joy at such a grand
chance for making their fortunes; for I told them I would
pay them just what they asked me, if they were all of the
finest water."</p>

<p>"Where did you learn so much rhodomontade?" said
Hilda. "I should think you had been born and bred in
Jotunheim."</p>

<p>"Not I. Don't tell me of any of your one-horse concerns,
up north among the Laplanders, where the frosts
put a veto upon their growing knee-high to a toad!"</p>

<p>"The northern people of Europe are not all Lapps, I
would have you to know," said Hilda, quite excited. "I
defy you to present a nobler history and mythology than
our northern people can."</p>

<p>"They will do well enough for old times, but they can't
shake a stick at America."</p>

<p>"Can your America, that you boast so much of, the
child of a day, as it were, compete with our time-honored
Europe, think you?"</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 144 -->

<p>"Don't be angry, Hilda, your country is well enough,
but I could crush it between my thumb and finger," said
he snapping them very provokingly.</p>

<p>"Are objects always measured by size, pray? Then
that great heap of charcoal, down in the hold, is worth
more than the Kohinoor diamond."</p>

<p>"I go for quantity and quality too; haven't we liberty in
America, while all Europe suffers a few upstarts to lead
her by the nose? Do be reasonable and confess that ours
is the greatest country the sun shines on. For what, pray,
are all the people coming there for, from over the water,
if it is not A number one, and no mistake?"</p>

<p>"They go as missionaries, to civilize and improve you,
to-be-sure."</p>

<p>"That's it, is it? Queer missionaries some of them!
At any-rate, missionaries or not, we give them a walking-ticket,
now and then, and they go home a little wiser than
they came. We are not going to have the prisons of Europe
emptied upon our shores, I can tell you."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; rose and walked away. She had been troubled
before by Hilda's free discussions with Young America,
which, more than once, had verged on ungentlemanliness
on his part, and anger on hers, but she had said all that
she thought necessary by way of check, and now she preferred
leaving what she saw plainly would be a scene of
excitement, and if Hilda chose to take a hint of her disapproval
of her course from it, she might.</p>

<p>"You spoke of the liberty prevalent in your country,"
she said, as Zo&euml; descended the gangway out of hearing.
"Very consistent your America is in its proud proclamation
of freedom, when there are three millions of
slaves in it! What kind of a republic is that, I should like
to know?"</p>

<p>"Just the best that can be. All who have a right to
freedom, value it the more for seeing the niggers under
the control they are and ought to be."</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 145 -->

<p>"That is just like the ancient Spartans, who made their
slaves drunken that the youths might scorn intemperance.
Pretty civilization that! Why, do you know that in
Europe, in classing countries according to their advancement,
we always designate those as barbarous who hold
slaves?"</p>

<p>"Who cares for Europe, or her opinions? She could
not exist a day without us to prop her up and take care of
her starving thousands. We've no poor of our own, but
old, worn-out Europe fills our almshouses bodily. If we
were not as magnanimous as we are, we could knock her
overboard any day. But we condescend to let her alone
for the present, because she has a few workshops which
we find convenient to draw from; but if she don't walk
pretty straight in future, we'll squeeze her flat for a picture,
put her into a frame, and hang her up in our big
gallery at home. She would be quite suggestive to the
artists, I reckon.</p>

<p>"As for the niggers, we have not made up our minds
yet whether they are human or monkeys. It will be time
enough to think of freeing them when we have settled that
question. I, for one, think that they are in the best place
they can be. So, hurrah for Jackson! Clear the track,
go ahead! I say. There, Hilda, you're beat. Your last
man is as dead as a door-nail. What do you say to that?"</p>

<p>Hilda said nothing but walked away, with head erected,
angry at his last speech about the Africans, and resolving
mentally to keep Mr. Stephenson at his distance in future,
and went down to the saloon.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; saw how it was, but said nothing. Hilda sat down,
tapped her foot in an excited manner on the floor, brushed
her curls hastily behind her ears, and looked at Zo&euml; as if
she wished her to speak to her.</p>

<p>"Braggart!" she at length exclaimed, "rude, ignorant!
Zo&euml;, do help me to hate that impertinent fellow. I'll never
speak to him again."

<!--- vol 2 page 146 -->

<p>Zo&euml; laughed&mdash;"Until day after to-morrow, it may be!"</p>

<p>"No, never. He is the most inconsistent person I ever
saw."</p>

<p>"I agree to it."</p>

<p>"I never could bear insolence, especially in one who
calls himself a gentleman."</p>

<p>"Stephenson does not intend to be insolent. He is
very free in his mode of speech to-be-sure, Hilda, especially
with you, who are the same."</p>

<p>"I never shall be again. I've learned a lesson I shall
not soon forget. He has deeply wounded my feelings."</p>

<p>"How?" said Zo&euml;, looking alarmed. "He surely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O no, no vulgarity&mdash;that you fear, of course. But the
fact is, I never can like him again. He has no feeling.
He is a cruel wretch."</p>

<p>"O no," said Zo&euml;, "There you do him injustice. He
is coarse, I allow, more in expression than in feeling, however,
and is, what Mrs. Liebenhoff would call, imperfectly
developed, therefore inconsistent. But he is fresh and
natural, and of a very bright mind. But, dear, I am glad you
have had this little quarrel, for you will be more cautious
with him in future, shall you not?"</p>

<p>"Never fear me again, Zo&euml;. I have made up my mind
how to treat him henceforward."</p>

<p>Filled with this resolution to be very self-restrained,
Hilda set about devising plans that all surrounding circumstances
might strengthen her to be so. Mr. Stephenson
had changed his original seat at the table, to be at her left
hand. He must be removed from it.</p>

<p>"Zo&euml;," said she, "I can't have George Stephenson near
me any longer at table. There are several reasons why it
is disagreeable. He both smokes and chews, and thus
makes himself a perfect tobacco manufactory, and I cannot
bear the effluvia therefrom;" and she turned up her pretty
nose, a little <i>retrouss&eacute;</i> at best, to quite an alarming
extant.</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 147 -->

<p>Zo&euml; smiled to herself, for, in a discussion the day before
respecting these offensive habits, she had strongly expressed
her aversion to them. Hilda, on the contrary, was
quite lenient towards the cigar, and insisted, with some
warmth, that she liked the scent of one of the best quality
very much. Now, however, a great change had taken
place in her constitution and tastes.</p>

<p>"Dr. Chichester is my evil genius in this way," said
Zo&euml;, "for you know I sit by him, and he chews, smokes a
pipe, and takes snuff besides. I don't know how a man
can expect to see the truth clearly, who shuts up his senses
at so many avenues from the subtle influences of the universe
about us, or utter it with any power, while he is so
little under the restraining influence of God's beautiful
physical laws. I never could rely on a man's virtue in any
respect, who had so little control over his appetites as these
customs evince."</p>

<p>"Let us ask the captain to remove their seats from our
vicinity."</p>

<p>"No, that will never do. If we wish to be rid of them,
we had better remove ours."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, not I; neither shall you, dear. Yes, I will
have them banished from our vicinity, on the plea that they
are nuisances. For they are so to the very point of disgust.
I will go this moment to Captain Stedman."</p>

<p>No sooner said than done. She swept her commanding
figure past Young America, as she went on her errand,
giving him only a dignified inclination of the head which
made him utter a very expressive whew! as she whirlwind-like
sailed by him.</p>

<p>"Captain," said she, with her most fascinating manner,
"you will oblige Miss Carlan and me very much, if you
will provide other seats, than those near us, for the two
American gentlemen, Dr. Chichester and Mr. Stephenson."</p>

<p>The captain opened his eyes, doubting that he heard
aright.</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 148 -->

<p>"We are extremely incommoded by the effects of the
disagreeable habits they indulge in. My friend has very
delicate perceptions, and she is inclined to sea-sickness,
and really it is but the part of common humanity to do so,
she suffers so much from any offensive odor."</p>

<p>"I should be most happy to oblige you, Miss Strophel,
and so far as it concerns the Dr. I can do so. For do you
think, the Americans have so unreasonable a prejudice
against the Africans, that he has but just now asked me to
remove Miss Carlan from his side at the table on account
of her color. He says that he never before sat at the table
with a 'yaller gal,' that was the term he used, and he can
abide her no longer."</p>

<p>"Did you consent to it?" said Hilda, towering up to her
full height.</p>

<p>"No, surely not, Miss. No Englishman would do that.
I hope that our common-sense and humanity are more than
skin-deep. But this request of yours gives me an opportunity
to comply with his wishes. I will give him a seat
near Lieutenant Wilson, and you may be sure he shall
know the reason of it too. A pretty good joke it is to have
the tables turned on him so completely! But I really do
not see how, with propriety, I can request Mr. Stephenson
to change his," and he looked curiously at Hilda.</p>

<p>"I desire it very much," said she, turning half away from
him to avoid his scrutiny. "The fact is, Mr. Stephenson
is&mdash;somewhat rude in his manners and too free in his
speech to make him an agreeable companion."</p>

<p>"Has he insulted you, madam?" said Capt. Stedman,
with a very serious air, as if not only the honor of his ship,
but of all Britain, were involved in the answer to his
question.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no, yes," said Hilda with the recollection of not
only her own wrongs, but Zo&euml;'s also, to give point to her
answer. "Yes, so far as the expression of most unwarrantable
contempt for my country and the race to which

<!--- vol 2 page 149 -->

my dearest friend belongs, can be called insult, he has,
Capt. Stedman. If Mr. Stephenson is allowed to take his
accustomed seat, I shall not come to the table."</p>

<p>"He shall be removed, Miss Strophel, depend upon it.
Do you like to see beautiful shell-work?" said he; "If so I
will show you a specimen."</p>

<p>She assented, and he led the way towards his state-room,
Hilda called Zo&euml; to share the pleasure with her for a beautiful
toy&mdash;it was a basket, which he had purchased for his wife,
made in the Bahamas of the small rice shells so abundant
in the islands, ornamented with wreaths and flowers, with
the bright-tinted mussel shells of various colors to give
semblance to the roses, pinks, and lilies, imitated in their
arrangement.</p>

<p>As soon as they had left him, the Captain went directly to
Mr. Chichester, and informed him that he would show him
to a seat at the approaching dinner-hour, by the side of the
Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, thank you," said he; "I am not used to keeping
company with these Children of Ham, on such equal
footing. If she knew her place, she wouldn't thrust herself
where she isn't wanted, but would go to the kitchen,
where she belongs. O! Captain Stedman, it is joining
hands with the enemies of the Lord, to favor, as you English
do, this accursed race&mdash;fairly fighting under the devil's
banner. Has not Jehovah said, through the mouth of his
servant, 'Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he
be unto his brethren?' " And he drew down the corners
of his mouth, and wrinkled up his forehead to the extreme
limit of sanctimoniousness.</p>

<p>The Captain gave no direct answer to this Biblio-infidel
speech, the offspring of a slavish, mistaken adherence
to the dead-letter of Scripture, leaving out of sight, entirely,
its free, humane, and life-giving spirit; but he hastened
to undeceive him, with regard to the cause of his
removal from Zo&euml;'s side.</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 150 -->

<p>"Miss Carlan has an aversion to the scent of tobacco, in
all its forms, and her friend, Miss Strophel, has requested
that she might be relieved from it. You will find the Lieutenant
a very agreeable, <i>cheerful</i> person, and I hope you
will <i>enjoy</i> your dinner in his company."</p>

<p>Mr. Chichester made no answer, but brought his cane
down twice upon the deck, with great emphasis; relieved
his feelings by a heavy half sigh and half groan, and
walked away.</p>

<p>The Captain next went to Young America, with whom
he was on familiar terms&mdash;the frank character of both parties
having led to a rapid acquaintance.</p>

<p>"What's in the wind between you and Miss Strophel?"
said he. "I've been thinking we might have a wedding
on board the <i>Forth</i>, but instead of that, one of the parties
sues for a divorce before the bans are celebrated. She
requests me to find a seat for you away from her. She as
much as told me, that you insulted her and her friend.
What's the fact of the case?"</p>

<p>"I insult her! It is the last thing I intended to do.
What! I insult a lady who joined the 'boys' in a regular
dance round an old bonnet, away up among the Rocky
mountains, a few years ago! I'm only too soft that way&mdash;a
regular spooney. I'm rather porcupiny, I know&mdash;rough
as a chesnut-burr in my speech, but it is only skin-deep.
I thought Hilda understood me. The fact is, I haven't considered
enough that she isn't the little sprite I used to hold
on my knee, the year I spent in Denmark, among the great
ones there. I must be more careful."</p>

<p>"But what about Miss Carlan? There the shoe pinched
the hardest."</p>

<p>"Lor'! there's her strange fancy for that Quadroon, the
only nigger I could ever tolerate. It is what I said about
the darkies that's killed me dead as a musquito. Well, I
shall have to be more prudent in future. What's my sentence?
Not more than hanging, I hope!"</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 151 -->

<p>"Just as you choose to consider it. You must take your
seat by the reverend Dr., at the Lieutenant's end of the
table."</p>

<p>"Not I. I'll go on the opposite side from her, if you
say so, but I am not quite ready yet to make my pillow
of coals of fire and rolls of brimstone. I can't go that,
any way you can fix it. Seeing it's Zo&euml;, I'll not make a
fuss about her color; I'll sit by her."</p>

<p>"You will have to do as I say, my friend. One of the
troubles is, that you and the Dr. are too odoriferous with
your tobacco, in its various forms, as you use it. So, you
see your room is considered altogether better than your
company."</p>

<p>"Whew! I was condescending to color a little too soon,
wasn't I? There's where the shoe pinches, is it? Well,
I must reform my habits. I've been promising my sister
that I would, for the last ten years."</p>

<p>"Begin to-day, and set the Dr. a good example. Who
knows but that you'll beat him at his own trade of saving
souls. Try it. Sit by him, like a good fellow, and make
no trouble about it."</p>

<p>"Well, if I ain't on the anxious seat now, I'm no born
Buckeye. Who'd have thought she would have turned up
for trumps, the ace of spades in that style? Heigh-ho!
I'll keep my eye cocked that way at dinner-time, and see
how much she means by all this maneuvering."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; was sitting in Hilda's state-room, looking over a
novel which Young America had lent her, and rendering
her friend the little assistance she needed in attiring herself
for dinner. The latter was kneeling by her trunk,
taking out from it one package after another, to find something
in its very lower strata. She was attracted from her
book by an occasional exclamation of impatience from her
companion.</p>

<p>"What are you looking for, dear? Can't I assist
you?"</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 152 -->

<p>"No, thank you. I have found it at last, my jewel box;
I want my diamond pin."</p>

<p>"On shipboard, Hilda! It is too showy for your plain
chintz dress. They don't look pretty together."</p>

<p>"I can't help it, Zo&euml;. It is diamond cut diamond with
Young America now, and I am going to reinforce myself
with external brightness. I'll see which is to carry the
day, the old or the new world. Braggadocio! I imagine
he thinks he is Jupiter Olympius, with his thunderbolts.
Humph!"</p>

<p>"And Juno is going to get up an equipage by herself,
instead of riding second to him in his car. Bravo! I think
I would not put on that red string, darling."</p>

<p>"My camel's-hair scarf! the handsomest part of my
wardrobe, you call by that ignominious name, Zo&euml;! You
are too provoking with your radicalism. See how soft it is!
Even you can appreciate that, though you won't acknowledge
that it is very beautiful."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is delightfully soft. Poor little victims to
woman's vanity! I should like to know if it is true, as I
have read, that it is made of the hair of the young camels,
taken from them before their birth? If so, I think it is a
great waste of creation to destroy so many useful animals
as must be necessary for what is of no more intrinsic
value."</p>

<p>"I know nothing about that. I only am cognizant of this
fact, that Miss Ingemann gave it me when she was in one
of her most queenly and magnificent moods, and I hope
that it will act as an &aelig;gis to shield me from impertinence.
Talking about his love-knots, with such a knowing look!
Not so fast, sir!" and Hilda towered to her extremest
longitude.</p>

<p>At dinner the arrangement was made agreeably to her
wishes, and she delighted Mr. Sarran, who had felt quite
neglected of late, by her playful sociability as he sat by her
side. She avoided glancing towards Mr. Stephenson, and

<!--- vol 2 page 153 -->

one might have thought he had dropped out of existence,
she ignored him so completely, until the dessert was on the
table. She and Mr. Sarran were preparing for a fillipeen,
both in high spirits. At a pause in their merriment, she
stole a glance towards a distant, diagonal corner of the
table, and unfortunately encountered Stephenson's eyes,
looking intently upon her from under his bent brow. What
possessed him, who had an hour before resolved to be
more reserved, respectful, and elegant, to carry his thumb
and forefinger to his nose, thus stamping him as Young
America still? She understood the symbol, for the day
before he had taught her it among other peculiarities common
to his countrymen. Her first impulse was to laugh,
but she subdued the mirthful expression down to a contracted
smile, and blushed, and rose and left the dining-saloon,
passing him, on her way out, in rapid talk with Mr.
Sarran.</p>

We must awake endeavor for defense;<br/>

For courage mounteth with occasion."</p>

<p>SHAKSPEARE</p>

<br/>

</div>

<p>IT was proposed in the evening
by Mr. Lindsey, that they should
all get up at an early hour to see
the sun rise the next morning.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; was not a very early riser,
but she was so desirous of being in
season for this object, that she arose
an hour before it was necessary.
She called Hilda, and they were
dressed and sitting in readiness to
go on deck, when suddenly there was great commotion
on board. Rapid steps went to and fro; the Captain's

<!--- vol 2 page 155 -->

voice was heard, giving orders&mdash;"Reverse the engine,
down with the sails, etc.," and then a violent resistance to
the vessel's motion threw both Zo&euml; and Hilda at their full
length upon their berth, upon which they were seated.</p>

<p>Shrieks, screams, oaths, prayers, and passionate exclamations
went up from each heart of this moving little
world, whose crack of doom was sending dismay and terror
to so many human bosoms; whose life-pulse was, for
the time being, so closely blended with their own.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; clasped her hands and bowed her head upon her
breast. Hilda shrieked, then clung to her friend, crying,
"Help me, Zo&euml;! We are dying, drowning. O save me!
save me!" and seemed as if she would go into convulsions.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; threw her arms around her, and soothed her as she
would an infant. "Hilda," said she, "do you remember
when we were little girls, that you feared to walk in the
streets one summer time, lest the mad dogs should bite
you?"</p>

<p>"I remember."</p>

<p>"And I told you that no evil could ever come to us,
which God did not oversee and turn to good, if we but
put our trust in Him. Then let us wait his will. Put on
your cloak and hood, dear, and I will go and see what is
the matter."</p>

<p>She met Mr. Lindsey at the door.</p>

<p>"What has happened, sir?"</p>

<p>"The ship has struck upon a reef of rocks. There is
no immediate danger for us, but we have got to leave
it. The boats are being lowered. I will assist you and
your friend."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; gathered her scattered articles of clothing together,
and put what she did not immediately want into her boxes,
locked them, and did the same for Hilda, with the assistance
which her trembling hands allowed her to render.
They were just leaving the rooms, when she caught sight
of the camel's hair scarf, hanging on a high nail. She

<!--- vol 2 page 156 -->

seized it and hastily tied it round Hilda's neck. Mr.
Lindsey took her arm to go out.</p>

<p>At that moment came young America, striding at full
speed along the passage.</p>

<p>"Take my arm, Miss Hilda," said he. "I'll place you
safely in the boat, and then return for your baggage.
Never fear," said he, as he felt her trembling hand.
"We'll weather this dry, sunshiny storm, and make better
headway than ever, after it."</p>

<p>They met Mr. Sarran in a great fluster a moment afterwards.
Viking as he was, he had not sufficient control
of himself to be of much service to any one, and was even
very glad of assistance by the strong arm of young America,
to help him into the boat, which was launched alongside of
the ship.</p>

<p>Poor little Mrs. Rose, the stewardess, a character in her
way, compounded of gossip, green tea and weak good nature,
whose life was made up of drudgery, complaining,
and cordial-sipping combined, was frightened half out of
her frail little wits. Mr. Stephenson took her up, as if
she were a rag-baby, and placed her in haste, between the
Lieutenant and the prim little Doctor of the ship, who each
of them held an oar.</p>

<p>Emma and Meta Pierson were in despair at first, lest the
boat should leave them. They had been beleaguering
their brother's door for the last ten minutes, refusing the
proffered assistance of Mr. Lindsey, the Captain and
others, feeling, that if either were to be drowned, they
would all go down together.</p>

<p>"Horace, pray hasten," said Emma; "we are lost if
you do not."</p>

<p>"I am coming. No danger, dear, at all. I see from my
port-hole just the condition of the ship. She will live for
hours yet."</p>

<p>"Do come, Horace," said Meta. "The last boat is just
on the point of leaving."</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 157 -->

<p>"The Captain won't dare to leave us behind. He is too
much of a gentleman. Never fear."</p>

<p>"Horace, for pity's sake, don't stop to clean your nails,
only come. Come, come," said Emma, giving a most
energetic knock at the door.</p>

<p>It opened, and my gentleman walked out perfectly self-possessed,
put an arm around each of his sisters, saying,
"There is not the least cause for fear. I have been in
greater danger than this many a time. What troubles you?
You should not be so impatient."</p>

<p>"There is no place for us in this boat and the others
have gone. See," said Emma.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pierson," said the Captain, "I have reserved places
for you and your sisters. Walk this way, sir." And with
his usual dignity and coolness, with a tender, protecting
oversight of his pale, frightened sisters, he made his way
to the seat assigned them&mdash;the very best on board.</p>

<p>"There!" said he as he sat down. "Don't you see
that I was right? Be sure and never be too early if you
want to fare well. Nothing provokes me like having people
over-punctual. There is nothing gained by it."</p>

<p>His sisters said nothing, but thought that if they lost no
external good there had been a great waste of feeling on
their part while waiting for him. And the passengers, one
and all, felt it to be an injustice that the whole company
should suffer exposure and inconvenience for the delay of
a single individual of their number.</p>

<p>"See how we feathers swim!" said Young America.
"That's the way in this world. Head up, so as to look
down upon it at an angle of forty-five degrees, and everybody
runs to wait upon you and give you the best that's going. See
him. How imperturbable he is. The first mark of a gentleman,
Hilda, is never to wink or move a muscle, if the
Angel Gabriel blows his trump of judgment right in your
left ear. I wonder if I shall ever be up to the trick!"</p>

<p>They were a few rods distant from the ship, when the

<!--- vol 2 page 158 -->

cook's waiter, a negro, whom they had taken on board at
Mobile, appeared on the deck of the sinking craft and sent
forth a piteous wail for help. He had been forgotten, and
had overslept himself, and was, therefore, left behind.</p>

<p>"Put back," said the Captain.</p>

<p>"We are already full," said one of the officers, "the
boat won't bear much more weight."</p>

<p>"There is room for him by me," said Mr. Lindsey. "Of
course, put back for him."</p>

<p>"O do, do," said Zo&euml; and Hilda.</p>

<p>"The Lord has been so gracious in saving so many
lives," said Dr. Chichester, "that it may be he wishes to
be glorified by the loss of this, his lowest servant. I really
am afraid we shall sink," said he, clutching hold of the
side of the boat and trembling with fear and the cold combined.</p>

<p>"Turn back, I say," said Young America, catching hold
of a spare oar, thus giving the aid of his arm to hasten the
boat's backward motion. "What kind of piety is that, I
should like to know, that has a sharp eye to number one in
this world and the next too!"</p>

<p>They found that the ship had drifted a little from its
position, and that a heavy surf prevented the near approach
of the boat. What was to be done now? The negro would
not trust himself to the waves. Young America, quick as
thought, tied a rope around his waist, put the other end
into the seamen's hands, and jumped into the water. He
struggled manfully a moment or two, ascended the vessel's
side, seized the cook by the collar of his pea-jacket, and in
a short time was on board again. Hurra! for Young
America, went up from a dozen voices, and Hilda looked
radiant with the pleasure and excitement of the deed.
Stephenson, as he sat by her side in his wet garments, and
noted the expression of her face, looked as if he should
like a shipwreck every day, if it would bring him so much
good luck as the present one had.</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 159 -->

<p>Mrs. Rose sat ensconsed in her nook by the side of
Lieutenant Wilson, who, with a sudden movement of his
arm, by accident, twitched the little woman's night-cap off,
and a breeze just at that moment taking it, it went overboard.
She cast a rueful glance, as she saw its exit, and
put her hand to her head, whose locks were none of the
thickest. "Let us give her one of the Dr.'s bandannas,"
said Stephenson, who sat directly behind him, and had a
good view of his great coat-pocket, which was stuffed with
tobacco, a bladder of snuff, three pipes, twice as many
handkerchiefs of different colors, to meet the exigencies
of his slavery to the weed; and last, but not least, a well
worn Bible. The Dr. might not have heard him, but just
at that moment he put his hand back to secure his property
better by giving it a thrust farther into its depths.
Hilda threw her pet scarf to her and had the satisfaction
of seeing her cover her head and all of her face with it,
excepting a narrow line about the width of the pupil of a
cat's eye at high noon, and at last drop asleep under its
comforting influence upon the Lieutenant's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Quashee, can't you move a bit from my neighborhood?"
said Stephenson.</p>

<p>"Does he crowd you?" said Hilda.</p>

<p>"No, but I can't help it, Hilda. I have a born antipathy
to niggers. The fact is, they are different from us every
way."</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Hilda, "he will hear you, poor fellow.
What a singular inconsistency you show! Here you have
just saved his life, at the expense of your own, and now
you dislike to have him near you."</p>

<p>"Another thing entirely! Who would not save a fellow-creature's
life, when it was in danger? But I have a particular
objection to have the monkey so near me"&mdash;and he
put his handkerchief to his nose.</p>

<p>"Sit by me, friend," said Hilda, making way for him by
her side, "There, that just balances this part of the boat.

<!--- vol 2 page 160 -->

Here is a thick shawl for you!" and she threw it ever
him.</p>

<p>Stephenson looked rather envious at this preference,
and thought how strangely different people's feelings were
on opposite sides of the Atlantic; but, no doubt, accounted
for it on the score of America being the <i>nicest</i> nation the
sun ever shone on.</p>

<p>The ship proved to have been lost eight miles from Jamaica.
The Captain had attempted a shorter course than
the usual one, and had not made sufficient allowance for
their drifting by the current. After an anxious night of
watching, he had retired, for a brief hour, to his state-room.
The sailors, while holystoning the deck, in the gray
of the morning, were admiring the bright reflection of the
moon's rays upon the waves, when, suddenly, they were
appalled by the faint roar of breakers which they were
approaching, whose white foam they had mistaken for the
moonbeams. They did everything that men could do; but
it was too late to arrest the vessel. She was carried upon
the shoals. Hence this shipwreck. They soon reached
the port with but little damage to health and comfort, but
with many painful regrets for the destruction of the good
ship <i>Forth</i>, and much sympathy for Captain Stedman's
misfortune.</p>

<p>THE passengers of the <i>Forth</i> found another English ship
bound to Barbadoes, lying at Kingston Harbor.</p>

<p>The <i>Thames</i>, Captain Arnold, was to sail in ten days,
and the gentlemen went immediately to engage berths in
her. The next afternoon they took carriages and rode
through the town and surrounding country; and Mr. Pierson
called on Santa Anna, who was then in the endurance
of a sort of exile from his country, and lived in the vicinity
of Kingston. He then rode out to a "<i>Pen</i>,"&mdash;the name
given to the small country seats on the island&mdash;to see
some old traveling acquaintances; and he brought an invitation
to his sisters to visit them the next day, and meet
the daughter and young wife of the hero of Mexican
notoriety.</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsey and his friends found letters and papers
from America, and in the evening the party gathered
around a table to read them and discuss their contents.</p>

<p>"What news from Mrs. Lindsey?" said Emma. "Has
she sent you any of her musings? or any more signs of the
times?"</p>

<p>"Yes, both. Should you like to hear them?"</p>

<p>The four young ladies assented, and he read the following,
after premising that his wife was spending the few

<p class="small">"RAMBLE THROUGH THE RAVINE.</p>

</div>

<p>"One sunny day, when the air whispered of all things
balmy and aromatic, and the trees were decked as if to
receive visits from the seraphim, whose home is in the
rainbow, so much do they love a brilliant ether, I found
this note on waking from my morning dreams. It was
written on a white stone, polished to smoothness, with ink
of elderberry and pen of reed. As it could not be folded,
the writing was shielded from prying eyes by a vail of
whitest frost, which only needed ten minutes' sunshine to
reveal to me the characters. It ran thus:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>" 'DEAR FRIEND AND LOVER:</p>

<p>" 'Come to me, I pray you, and let us take a stroll together. We
are twin souls&mdash;is not that the phrase? and I am longing for sympathy,
and simple and true affection. I know you live in the great
city, where the big Ohio now rolls with swelling pride, now contracts
to most penurious width and volume; now floweth clear and
transparent as a cheap window glass, now turbid and opaque as
brown sugar and water, very, very sweet. Still I think you are not
quite spoiled by such capricious company, and if you are a little
dingy soulward, by communing with such a dubious companion, I,
with my clear-eyed purity and transparency, will look into your
being, and banish hence each vile intruding parasite. Come, O!
come to</p>

<p>" 'Your loving</p>

<p>" 'BROOK.'</p>

</div>

<p>"Could I refuse? I knew you would not be jealous of
such an innocent country beau, especially as you know
him well, and love his playful, simple wiles as well as I.
So I donned my hat and mantle, and went straight forth to
meet and greet him.</p>

<p>"He looked so sweet and pure as I approached him,
that I forgot my bashful modesty, and without blushing,
said, 'Good morning, owny, dony Brooklet! If it were

<!--- vol 2 page 163 -->

proper, I would say how much I love you. You are my
delight, my pride and admiration, and next summer&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'What of next summer, say you?' Brooklet answered.
'I know of no next summer. I asked you to come and see
me <i>now</i>. The present is our time. Do not be naughty for
me to scold you. O! do, for once, live in the present.
Both of us may be asleep next summer&mdash;who knows?
That comes of your city living. But cheer up; see how
merrily, merrily I flow, now here, now there, now babbling
with a wreathed bough, now curling round a mossy stone,
and anon finding a broader space to make myself a mirror for
the sky, and clouds, and trees to gaze into. Are they not
pretty? I love them as well as you. Therefore, I drink
in their beauty and receive tokens of their affection. And
to-morrow morning early, mark me well, and you will see
my incense of praise rising to heaven as thanks to the
generous Giver of all this love and beauty, and for making
me a portion of his living, fluent universe.'</p>

<p>" 'O Brooklet! you are beautiful and good, and I will
learn a lesson from you; and now, though I love to wander
with you, yet by your bounty, you have made these trees
so grand and stately, and they are so eloquent that I must
leave you briefly and commune with them. Hark, Brooklet!
hear them chant a strange, low tune, solemn, yet musical
and calmly rapturous, high up among their branches.</p>

<p>" 'This is the Air.'</p>

<p class="small">" 'Slowly wave we high above thee,<br/>

From poisonous breaths of earth we save thee,<br/>

From scorching sun's rays, close we guard ye,<br/>

O! spare us, and we'll farther teach thee.<br/>

Love us, and we'll ever shade ye,<br/>

<p>" 'Come to me, come to me,' Brooklet says. 'See my
mosaic. Was any so lovely, ever? Shall I give you my
receipt for it? I just heap up the pebbles underneath me,
and flow a little roughly over them, the bright sun shining
down to my depth, meantime, and any quantity, of different
size and shape and hue are made to order. But I've got
a patent for them, so if you think to steal them and carry
home, with which to adorn yourself, why, you will be disappointed;
for only on Brooklet can they be seen to be the
jewels that they are. Look your fill on me. It is just as
well, and better, if you would but think so&mdash;than stingily
to crave them for your own, to lock up in your cabinet, two-thirds
and a half of the time. That is no proper way.
Brooklet does not do so, O, fie!</p>

<p>" 'And now ascend the little hill,' my Brooklet says,
'and see what you can see.'</p>

<p>" 'O Brooklet! a broad and spacious natural park, with
trees just numerous enough to shade, without gathering
unhealthful damp and gloom. No underbrush to impede
my walk, and tear my robe, and green grass plenty, for a
carpet. Yes, and for these gentle kine's food too. They
eat it as if they liked it. Patient animals! I love to look into
your soft, dark eyes. I know there is more beneath their
surface, than the soulless wot of. They tell me of something
very strange, yet what I love to ponder. We'll
keep it a secret, won't we, Mooley cow, my childhood's
rustic friend?</p>

<p>" 'And there's the mansion of the rich proprietor. It
has been better in its day, and might be prettier now.
Nathless it has an easy, insouciant look I don't dislike, as
if the lady resident fled from her city fine one, to enjoy

<!--- vol 2 page 166 -->

more the woods and thee, O Brook! than dazzling walls
and the world's foolish, costly gear. But there's a noble
barn, showing that a careful farmer is he, who tills his
lands, reaping a harvest a hundred-fold, I ween, more than
he sows. Here is an orchard, and a vineyard, too. <i>They
say</i>, he is very generous with their bountiful products. I
wish he would send me some. Ask him, Brooklet! next
time you see him. And hint to him in your most winning
way, my sweet one, that he to whom God has intrusted
this rich domain as his time-steward, should be liberal to
every righteous cause&mdash;religion, morals, learning, art,
science, and every good of life, as the bounteous lands he
calls his own are to his easy culture. Now I think of
it, I had rather you would send the message to him through
his gentle lady, whose rapt soul dreams of perfection
attained by mortals, even on earth. She will persuade him
if he needs, I know.'</p>

<p>" 'O cease your prosing,' Brooklet says, 'and come to
me here. Did you ever see a spring so powerful, clear,
and health-inspiriting as this one? I call it mine in my
presumption.'</p>

<p>" 'O where did you get it, Brooklet?'</p>

<p>" 'Its source is in&mdash;the Andes, I dare say. It trickles
down their sides, joining the river's flow, making strange
meandering on its way, gathering the subtle essence of
salts and minerals, down deep, deep in the earth, and
when well concocted by the great doctress. Nature, wells
up with a strong flow&mdash;you would not believe me&mdash;much
less remember&mdash;how many gallons in a minute, just for
you, ungrateful men and women that you are!'</p>

<p>" 'Why ungrateful, Brooklet? My best friend likes it
well. So should I, only I have such a deep and living
well of exhilarating gas within me, that when I quaff of
yours, my head aches with the excess. Excuse me, but
really it is quite unnecessary for me to put you to so low
a use. I love to look upon you, and I gain more than

<!--- vol 2 page 167 -->

corporeal life thereby, even a stronger, freer swell to my
soul's flight. Pray, call me not ungrateful.'</p>

<p>" 'Well, not you then, but your brothers and sisters, who
swallow so many of the concentrated drugs found in earth's
laboratory, that they sicken and die before their hour, or
drag out a painful existence, worse than death a thousand
times. Now, if they were wise, they would come and drink
of me and my many sister-springs in the broad, ample range
of this, your country. Tell them so, my friend.'</p>

<p>" 'They will not believe me, simple country Brook!
They would dub me Quack, or, if they came to quaff you,
it would only be after their physic's dose&mdash;by way of dessert
at best. The Doctor tells them that the great pills or
the little ones have much more potency. I have warned
them over and over again to be more chary of him. It is
of no use. Please excuse me.'</p>

<p>" 'I had some friends and followers once,' poor Brooklet
murmured, 'whose trail stretched through these woods&mdash;sons
of the forest, dear to me as my own music in the
hush of even. But alas! alas! they are gone, all gone!
The white man swept them far away beyond my ken, and
ever since there has been a note of sadness in my song
which I cannot away with. Even though learning sits in
yonder halls, and science, whose steady working just below
in its hydraulic symbol, speaks of increasing purity and
intelligence in my servitors, thus cheering my onward way,
yet shall I never, never flow on in my old-time gladsomeness,
until the red men's children come hither, as of yore
their fathers did, and share with equal lot with those the
white man's blessings, and range these woods with free
but milder spirit than before, befitting the <i>Christian</i> sons
of nature. O bring them back to me and I will love and
bless you evermore!'</p>

<p>" 'I will, my Brooklet! Already are their eyes, with
longing, turned to thee, and wait but for the white man's
tender&mdash;the silver coin&mdash;to accumulate, through industry

<!--- vol 2 page 168 -->

or just due's payment, to bring their sons, a goodly band,
to be nurtured by your side. O sigh not so, my Brooklet!
Not many moons shall wane before Tecumseh's children,
brothers and sisters both, a goodly band, shall drink of thee
as erst their father did. They will instruct the people in
thy virtues, and then we shall return to nature's laws of
health, from which we have so far departed.'</p>

<p>" 'Turn to the right, walk through the park,' the Brooklet
leaps and answers, 'and I will show you how glad I am
at the thought of greeting my own again.'</p>

<p>" 'Yes, friend, I know the way. Ah, now I hear thee,
laughing louder and more gayly than e'er before. I will
descend the bank and lean against this tree, planted on
purpose for those who love thee, to lean against and look
their fill into thy depths. Bravo! Brooklet, thou art glad
and joyous indeed. Thy cascade need never hide itself for
shame, for here it bounds and leaps and pours and soars.
It dashes and sprays and shines and foams. It runs and
drops and trickles and glistens. It shakes and waves and
ripples and bubbles. It winds and glides and murmurs
and gurgles. What can Niagara more?</p>

<p>" 'If I might only say next summer, (now you are so
good-natured you will not chide me,) I will get behind thy
beady vail, and Naiad-like, see how the world appears
through thee. But now thou art too chilly in thy embrace,
for the first kiss of autumn hath left its mark upon thee.
He is very generous in his gifts, raining them down, day
after day, till we, if not ye, are almost weary of his profusion;
yet, for all that, I love and admire you at this distance
better than nearer.</p>

<p>" 'And now, my Brooklet Waterfall! I wish to follow thy
windings, even as far as the Pool, a long, long stroll for
these degenerate days of dainty exercise; and I am afraid
to trust thy guidance, lest thou shouldst play me a trick,
thou art so full of glee and frolic. I'll even ask this lad
the shortest way, for if you wander here, and there, and

<!--- vol 2 page 169 -->

everywhere, we'll separate for a time, only to meet again
more happy than before.</p>

<p>" '<i>He</i> says I cannot cross you, and knows but very little
about you any way, it seems to me. So don't be vain, as
if you were the universe in a rill, and everybody lived by
you. You are only my own, my darling Brook, just big
enough, and none too little, so we'll go together as far as
best we may.</p>

<p>" 'And so you widen and widen, naughty, provoking
Brooklet! that I need not cross you. We'll see. I'm
neither sugar nor salt to melt at your moist and softening
touch, so I'll e'en doff my hose and shoon, and wade
across. I'm not at all afraid of <i>you</i>, but those sharp
stones! And then, by chance, some gazer may pass by.
Well, my foot is not so ugly, I would have you know&mdash;rather
large I own&mdash;but only proportioned to my size; and
I've not squeezed it to make believe it smaller, therefore I
am not ashamed of it&mdash;and pointed stones to walk on are
not so bad, if you but get accustomed to them. So here
am I <i>in for it</i>. I defy you, saucy Brooklet!</p>

<p>" 'I see your drift. You are going to lead me many a
mile, with your numerous crooks and turns, so I'll just cut
across, and meet you by-and-by. <i>Au revoir!</i>'</p>

<p>"And now begin my troubles. Here is a fence to climb.
Never mind, they called me 'Tom-boy' when a child, and
now I reap the advantage. I'm over with a bound, my
frock a little torn, but I'm a woman. I can at least mend
that, without departing from my <i>sphere</i>. Another fence!
and now a ditch, and next a field new plowed! I've
crossed them all with little damage; but dear, dear me!
what pricks me so? Ten thousand pointed pins sticking
to me and my wardrobe in the shape of vegetable vermin&mdash;to
give them a genteel name. 'Beggar's lice,' we called
them in our school-days. This host of Lilliputians is the
worst trial after all. I verily fear they will pin my clothes
so close about me, that a new edition of the pillar of salt

<!--- vol 2 page 170 -->

will be advertised in the <i>Morning Journal;</i> I being condemned
to savory bondage for looking <i>forward</i> too much,
instead of <i>backwards</i>, as was the sin of the olden matron.</p>

<p>I'll hie to the welcome wood near by, and rid me of
my enemies, which, like the smaller trials of life, are harder
to bear than great ones. I'll sit in this cool shade; no, I'm
very warm, and the sudden change will give me fever and
ague. Well, here is a sunny spot! no, that will cause the
typhoid, bilious or intermittent! O dear, dear, dear! what
weaklings we have got to be, that if Nature, kind and loving,
blows with her cool, refreshing breath upon us, we
straightway tremble like cowards; or smile upon us cordially,
and we melt into tenuity! <i>I'll</i> not be a slave to miasma
or any evil demon which would mar me and make
me useless in this busy world. I've made a compact with
creation, and am so docile to her behests, that she strengthens
me with her best spirit's might, which can withstand
foes that a faithful oversight cannot remove.</p>

<p>"Now freed from my Lazzaroni, I'll join my Brook
again. But where is he? Hark! I think I hear him. No,
it is the music of the trees. What harmony they have
caught from each other, showing they should live together;
for if one is absent the other always languishes.</p>

<p>" 'Now I see; here you are again, and another waterfall!
Am I so near the Pool as this evinces? I fear not,
so I'll take the highway to it another day. I'm rather
crestfallen, I own, at my disgraceful failure to find a rural
path to it. But this cascade! not quite so pretty as the
first, is it my Brook? yet very fair.'</p>

<p>"I see a mansion near. I'll cross the stone bridge just
above, and reconnoitre, and then go home by the beaten
path. What! two proprietors hereabouts, with such surroundings
grand!</p>

<p>"O foolish me! It is the very, very same, and I've but
wandered round and round to the same point again. 'I beg
ten thousand pardons, Waterfall! I really thought you

<!--- vol 2 page 171 -->

your twin brother, only not quite so pretty; but the other
side of your face is a little different, you know, from this
one&mdash;and then I'm weary, and objects are less bright in
consequence. Besides, a shadow has fallen over my spirit,
such as does sometimes in looking towards the future, and
shall I say it, Brooklet? I will to you, though I'm almost
ashamed to, for I am no child. I woke this morning weeping,
and my eyes are rather dim, of course. Do others
cry as well as I, I wonder?'</p>

<p>" 'Yes,' Brooklet answers, 'Nature is very willful, and
if she is dammed and dyked by day, so as to keep the tide
from rising too far and overflowing, why, she has her own
way at night, I ween, when all are sleeping. I would, if I
were she.'</p>

<p>" 'And now we'll return the upland way, in sight and
hearing of you, my Brooklet, and meet the lowland path at
the foot of the 'Camel's Back.' We've crossed the little
stream, but which way now! I'm puzzled. This way I'll
go. No, the other. No, it will lead me wrong. What shall
I do? 'Look at the sun,' I hear you say, my husband. Well,
there is the sun in the heavens, and my abiding place on
the earth, but how to put that and that together, I know
not, so as to be an aid to me! O dear! I shall be late to
dinner, and I, an <i>authoress</i>, pride myself upon being punctual
like <i>common people!</i> My hostess, if she were not
kindly and were not one herself, would say: 'What trouble
a novelist is! Deliver me from such!' Well, she will have
a subject for her next story, 'The Woman in the Wood;'
and I will make a compact with the bluejays, as all the
robins have flown, to bury me with leaves, for, Brooklet!
you have completely hemmed me in, and where to go, I
know not. So, of course, nothing is left for me but to lie
down and die by thee. I'm glad my fate is nothing worse.'</p>

<p>"Nonsense! here is the path, all plain as daylight, I
know some trick has been played upon me. The earth

<!--- vol 2 page 172 -->

must have whirled around four times as often as it ought,
and hence my blunder. I'll arrange my fluttered garments.
But here is wheel-grease on my clean, gingham
frock. Ten minutes ago it was fresh and pure. Yes, here
is the proof of mischief. Ph&oelig;bus, whirling by, spattered
me from his car. We came too near him in our whirligig.
I wonder, and I wonder.</p>

<p>"Two students from yon college overtake me. One
says to the other: 'The earth in going round the sun
makes a loop each day.' 'No, not each day, but once in
twenty-nine. Yes, once it makes a loop, each nine and
twenty days.'</p>

<p>"Ah! that explains it all. I happened in the loop, in the
smallest part, and hence my loss of way, and hence the
wheel-grease from Ph&oelig;bus' car. Good for the college!
I'll always live by one, and when I lose the points of compass,
its philosophy will enlighten me of the cause.</p>

<p>" 'And now, my loving Brooklet! before we part, I'll tell
you a little secret. My life began like yours, all poesy and
dreams. But this is a rude world, and I was taught by
lessons drear that a foundation, stable and strong, must
underlie them, so I turned aside to con the teachings of the
work-day world. I've learned them pretty well by heart,
and now I return to poesy and dreams again, and who
knows but I shall make them actual? So, Brooklet! ne'er
forget me, for many a stroll we'll have together in the
sunny, playday future. Adieu, for a day, adieu.' "</p>

<p>"And now for the 'signs of the times,' " said Hilda.</p>

<p>"It is too late this evening," said Mr. Lindsey, "but
to-morrow I will read them."</p>

<p>On the arrival of the party at the hotel, Mr. Chichester
had proposed that they should immediately unite in thanksgiving
to God for their wonderful preservation from the
dangers of the deep. But there was bustle and excitement
and work on every side, so it was declined for the

<!--- vol 2 page 173 -->

present by the others of the party. He thought it a sad
sign of an ungodly temper and ungrateful spirit.</p>

<p>Now, however, when all was quiet and they were about
to separate, Mr. Lindsey, with earnest words and spirit, expressed
their gratitude to God for his loving care, and felt
the truth anew that his watchful Providence never sleeps
but is on every side, caring for us no less on the fearful
deep, with but a plank between us and death, than now in
the still room, with the refreshing land-breeze passing
through it, seaward, to return the tribute the ocean rendered
it by day.</p>

<p>He assented, and read the following chapter purporting
to be from the publication of Mrs. Pumpkin, entitled&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"TOO MUCH MAN.</p>

</div>

<p>"I read in yesterday's Journal, that 'a great mob of
women' were assailing the printing presses, eager to have
their works published. Now, thought I, is my time. I
don't like to be conspicuous, and among a crowd a modest
woman, who likes nothing so well as to do her work
quietly in her own way, won't be painfully noticeable. So
I'll begin to write this very afternoon.</p>

<p>"My little niece, Hattie, says that she is going to make
haste and learn to write, because she has a story on her
mind which she wishes to have published. I should be
mortified to have her outstrip me in literature; therefore I
will delay no longer.</p>

<p>"Now, I am not going to write an elegant, stiff, prosy
book, according to the rules of the critics, but an easy,
conversational, and very frank one. Not that I am going to
be a second Mrs. Nickleby and tell all about myself and the
world that I know of, and a little more, but as far as I go I
shall tell the <i>truth</i>. It is to have pictures, and as the substance
of it is to be so very plain, I have concluded to put
a little touch of the genteel to it by giving it a French
name out of compliment to my illustrator, who is from
France. So I call it 'La V&eacute;rit&eacute;.' I mean to have the same
publisher that my friend Mrs. Applebutter has. She sent
him her work when she had completed ten chapters out of
the forty, and he agreed to publish it. Is there another in
the United States, in these cowardly and money-making
times, that would dare to make such an engagement with
a woman? For you know it is very doubtful if it is bright
enough to be salable, or, if that is the case, she might
take a notion to bring him into it in some odd, freakish way
or other. I shall be just as likely to as not, so he had better
think twice before he dares to make a bargain with me.</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 176 -->

<p>"Mrs. Applebutter has an idea that her Tale is going to
have a great run, and she chose him, because he is the
white horse, spoken of in Revelation, 'which goes forth
conquering and to conquer.' There was a time in the
summer, when she had some doubts about it, he appeared
so slow and sleepy, but deary me, she says he pricks up his
ears, and goes at such a gallop now, that it is as much as
she can do to keep up with him. However, these were her
words&mdash;'I should like to see the printers that can set types
as fast as I can write. And, my dear Mrs. Pumpkin, there
is one thing I am very set about, if he does not use the
fortune my Tale brings him, in fulfilling the prediction
concerning him in the sixth chapter of Revelation, second
verse, by doing the great work which he is so well fitted
for, he gets no more of my books to publish. Not that I
am going to watch and pry into his affairs; I have enough
else to do, but just to see that he sets out on the right
track, and then he may go to Polonia, if he pleases, only I
hope he won't jump over into the big pond, nor get stuck
to an iceberg up there, as then he would be of no more
use hereabouts. For I am not going to be like some <i>men</i>,
I know of, who have their property invested in a big or a
little grog-shop, and then, if anybody gets murdered in it,
or the drunkard's wife and children lead a life of misery,
for the husband buying whisky in it, he waves his hand
very genteel-like, and says, 'Very sad, very bad, Mrs.
Applebutter!' and then sips his tea and laughs and chats
as if nothing had happened. No, no, my property goes
for better uses than such-like ways.'</p>

<p>"What could I but say, on hearing this last remark. <i>Too
much man</i>, altogether! <i>too much man!</i></p>

<p>"For one of the pictures, I shall introduce the printing-press
which helps me to give 'La V&eacute;rit&eacute;' to the public.
It has a very <i>knowing</i> look, as it is waited upon by a company
of young women, who like nothing better than by its
means to proclaim their own freedom. The friendly

<!--- vol 2 page 177 -->

proprietor does not frown a particle, as it winks first at one
young girl, and then at another. His inward voice has
told him, that it is none too early for that same publication,
so though he may keep his broad brim upright in the midst
of the general ogling, yet he will say, 'If thee has a call
to preach this gospel, Mrs. Pumpkin, thee may as well do
it in this way, as to use thy earthly organs of speech in
the Quarterly Meeting. Thee must follow thy own light.'
This God-speed is no more than I should expect of a sect
which has always been a friend to humanity, whether found
in the poor Indian, the Black Niggers, or the White ones.
<i>Not</i> too much man there!</p>

<p>"If I happen to like any of my lady friends better than
my dead ones, I shall work them over into characters for
my bantling. Indeed I should like to have them all perpetuated
in this way, (for of course they will be if I put
them in my book,) but that would keep me writing too long.
So for those that I omit I shall put a caret thus, ^ which
means that they are all understood. I think they will
make a very pretty bouquet, arranged tastefully as I shall
try to have them. For a bouquet-holder, I shall take a
stalk, very seedy at the end, (as I have a great fancy for
symbols,) which means the men, and that brings me to the
subject of my first chapter, '<i>Too much man!</i>'</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 178 -->

<p>"But I forget; I must go back a little, to be up to the
times.</p>

<p>"I know it is the fashion for authoresses to have their
faces for the frontispiece of their books; but I am not
handsome enough for that, so I shall put my heroine there
instead. But supposing the public were curious to know
how I look, I will gratify them so far as to say&mdash;so much
like all the rest of the world, that nobody knows us apart,
so I have to tell people when I speak to them, which is
which.</p>

<p>"Autobiographies too, are all the vogue, therefore I will
just give a hasty sketch of my parentage and life.</p>

<p>"I am of the good old stock of the Puritans, and that is
what makes me so free and easy, for you well know that
they liked liberty. My remote ancestors, my father, my
husband and most of my relations are ministers, and that,
of course, is why I am so very lively. I was born in the
country, which makes me feel very much at home in the
city. I am just old enough to feel very young, tall enough
not to suffer myself to be trampled upon, and not too tall
to cause inconvenient expense for my wardrobe in the
present lean condition of Mr. Pumpkin's purse.</p>

<p>"I am a Unitarian Christian in religion, which makes
me a believer in all the faiths which ever were preached.
I am a Know Nothing in politics, which is the reason
that <i>I know something</i> of what most interests 'Sam' in
these days, and especially gives me a great liking for
foreigners.</p>

<p>"I have no children, so, having all creation to select
from, I have a very large family.</p>

<p>"With regard to my attainments, having led a very industrious
life, much of it in the kitchen, I am, of course,
mistress of considerable literature. I have no accomplishments,
so I am quite an artist. I always like to read prose
better than rhyme, therefore, I am a poetess. I have
never had much time to observe and study nature, so I am

<!--- vol 2 page 179 -->

a passionate lover of it and know a good many of her
secrets; and though I am as sinful as my neighbors, I am
very religious.</p>

<p>"With regard to whether I have genius or not, that will
depend upon how it is defined. In a conversation with
some of my friends the other evening, I said, 'A genius is
one who knows what is what, and who is who, and how to
do a thing or two.' A gentleman, who sat by, said it was
one who knows '<i>beans;</i>' another said it was he whose
'mother knows he is out' and yet is not anxious lest he
should get into trouble. While an elderly lady said, that,
in her opinion, 'it was one who knows enough to come in
when it rains.'</p>

<p>"According to either of these definitions, I am a genius,
but I prefer my own, as being the most comprehensive.</p>

<p>"I think that I have enlightened the Public sufficiently
about myself, so I will resume my subject. If I think of
any other items I will just throw them into the body of the
chapter.</p>

<p>"Some people of my acquaintance don't like to be
classed with the <i>Feminines</i>, though they belong in that
category. I should like to know which of the other classes
suits them better. I suppose they would say: 'We wish to
be manly.' But what is the great difference, pray, between
manly and womanly, when the <i>mal</i> part of the animal is
struck out? What are they going to occupy themselves
about, if they are not feminine, or where are they going to
live? There are to be no more wars, and fighting and
murder make the great distinction between them now.
America is a woman, and Religion is a woman, and the
Arts and Sciences are women, and Literature is a woman.
Ceres, which means farming, is a woman; Pomona, which
means horticulture, is a woman; and Flora is a woman.</p>

<p>" 'Politics and law,' they say, 'will be left to them.'
Not so fast. There is to be no more diplomacy, and log-rolling,
and litigation. Justice and Truth are going to

<!--- vol 2 page 180 -->

carry the day, and they are women, so if they don't consent
to be <i>Feminines</i>, they are in danger of being nowhere
and nothing at all in the new times coming. But the
trouble is they won't believe in the advent of the new era.
They are too proud to look at the signs of the times, and
be strong in faith. They had rather reason and argue
of the future from the past. <i>Too much man! too much
man!</i></p>

<p>"Then the <i>Big-eyes</i> are always running after shadows,
such as twin-soulships, affinities, harmonies, and the like.
The provoking part of it is, however, that each one has so
many psychological mates. If they would remain true to
their sublime theory and faithful to <i>the</i> twin-soul, one
would have more trust in them. But no! they find any
quantity here and there at the corners of the streets, sitting
at the windows, or in the newspapers&mdash;just as it happens.
Or perhaps they pride themselves so much upon their <i>big-eyes</i>
that they get to think they are the Olympian Jove and
can look down any obstacle in their way to their <i>twin-soul</i>,
and so pick and choose as they please. But you may be
sure they do it by night instead of in broad daylight, and
are very careful to have no spectators, especially ladies.
They, perhaps, know how sharp <i>they</i> are to detect them,
though they may be as sly as Moses and treacherous as
Judas. Dear, dear me! When will even <i>Big-eyes</i>, that
call themselves wise, get developed to the point of seeing
that there is one greater than themselves, who puts a veto
upon such proceedings, or if they choose to break his
laws, why they suffer the consequences, that is all. Destruction
is not their forte. The <i>ani</i>-MALS can beat them at
that, any time. To re-create is what they were born for.
Matters will come right in eternity, if not in time, if they
will but be patient and faithful.</p>

<p>"My theory about twin soul-ships and <i>true marriages</i> is
this: That if you are married, your husband or your wife,
whichever it may be, is your <i>psychological complement</i>,

<!--- vol 2 page 181 -->

unless the single cause which our Saviour speaks of, divides
you. God had a hand in joining you for wise reasons of
his own. It is for you to find out what they are, and get
and return all the good from the marriage which was intended.
If he sees that it would be better for either of
you to be separated, why He will arrange it. But for
Heaven's sake be quiet and do your duty where Providence
has placed you, and give up this disgusting cant,
and these sickening, corrupting meetings and circles, and
billings and cooings which disgrace yourselves, bring scandal
upon the whole subject of spiritual affinities, (in which
there is a great truth no doubt,) and lead to moral and
physical death and destruction.</p>

<p>"No, no. <i>Big-eyes</i> are not to be relied upon. Magnetism
and Spiritualism have got the better of them&mdash;instead of
their handling the subjects as great souls should&mdash;notwithstanding
all their mighty power and wisdom, and advancement
before the age. They wield the most subtle and life-inspiring
element in creation, as if it were a plaything
given them to make themselves and others fools with. Not
so did Jesus; and until they learn of him the high purposes
for which it was given them, and catch from his transcendent
superiority the spirit with which he wielded it, they
will remain no better than poor, blundering, blind, destructive
infidels and idiots. That is a piece of my mind upon
the subject!</p>

<p>"If I were a young lady, and <i>Big-eyes</i> offered himself
to me, I would make a very safe compact with him, else I
should expect if he got tired of me, and saw another 'twin-soul'
in the distance he liked better, he would stare at me
with all his might, and I should find myself in my winding-sheet
before my time. Supposing, for instance, he had
chosen to divide the happiness he expected from me into
eight portions, and he had got five-eighths, and chose to
take for granted that the other three-eighths would be withheld,

<!--- vol 2 page 182 -->

he would want no better excuse to put me aside for
another 'complement.'</p>

<p>"So I advise my young friends to make a very sharp
bargain&mdash;something like this: Of course it is taken for
granted that half of all the property and privileges of the
partnership, as much of his society as she likes, and power
to do just as she pleases, in everything, is to be hers.
Leave the discussion of those points to the <i>ani</i>-MALS. He
has got beyond that.</p>

<p>"But after he has promised an unheard-of amount of
love and devotion, just say to him 'there is one little proof
more that I require of you before I consent to marry you.'</p>

<p>" 'What is it? It is yours, it is yours!'</p>

<p>" 'Wait a bit,' I say; 'don't be rash!'</p>

<p>" 'What is it? I shall only be too happy! O! tell me
what it is?'</p>

<p>" 'To die when I do!'</p>

<p>"He pauses and seems taken aback.</p>

<p>" '<i>To die when I do!</i>'</p>

<p>" 'But really, how can I promise that?'</p>

<p>" 'TO DIE WHEN I DO!'</p>

<p>"He stands deep in thought for a moment, and then exclaims
joyfully: 'Yes, yes, I promise to die when you do!
Yes, I die when you do; be mine, be mine!' Then very
coolly get up, and bowing to him over your left shoulder,
leave the room, saying 'I'll think about it.' It is the only
safe way, you may depend upon it, of treating the men,
and especially <i>Big-eyes</i>. For if you should say, Yes, and
perhaps give him your daguerreotype to save him from
shooting himself, or you, and make him good-natured,
then ten to one he does not go away and forget it after all.
That is the way with the men. <i>Too much man!</i></p>

<p>"Now for the <i>ani</i>-MALS! I hardly know where to begin
upon them, they need so many <i>truths</i> to set them right,
that it will require more than 'La V&eacute;rit&eacute;' to do it. But I

<!--- vol 2 page 183 -->

think their cowardice is their most glaring fault, so I'll
commence with that.</p>

<p>"In their wars they show this vice on a gigantic scale.
They are <i>afraid</i> they shan't have territory enough, or they
are <i>afraid</i> they shan't be thought the bravest people under
the sun, or they are <i>afraid</i> they shall lose their kingship,
or presidentship, or what not; or they are <i>afraid</i> the people
will get to think themselves as good as they are, so they
go to war like the <i>ani</i>-MALS they are. <i>Too much man, man,
man!</i></p>

<p>"So in politics, instead of being fair and open as if they
were doing something right and proper and for their country's
good, they get together in little companies here and
there and are mighty secret about their movements. Diplomacy
and pipe-laying, and lobbying and caucusing, and
what not they call it, but it is just nothing but cowardice.
And if a word is said about the women or the negroes and
other sensible, innocent but courageous people joining
them and putting in a word, why they absolutely turn pale
and shake with fear, or grow angry or abusive, which is a
certain sign of cowardice. <i>Too much man, I say, too
much man!</i></p>

<p>"Then as to all the moral questions of the day, they are
a set of arrant cowards. If slavery is spoken about, or
preached about, or written about, or voted about, or labored
about, dear me! they are half frightened out of their wits.
They are <i>afraid</i> the negroes will rise and kill them,
though they have had proof upon proof that they never do
so when their freedom is given them; so out of <i>fear</i> they
keep them in bondage. They are <i>afraid</i> they shall come
to poverty, or shan't be thought so grand if they do them
the simple justice to free them, so they tighten their chains.
They are <i>afraid</i> the Union will split to pieces if they even
talk upon the subject, and try to devise methods to set this
matter right. They are <i>afraid</i> they shan't make so much

<!--- vol 2 page 184 -->

money if anything is said upon it, so they are either <i>mum</i>,
or furious, or are so <i>frightened</i> that they hide themselves
behind any screen they can find. Then there is the ever-present
fear of losing office if they speak upon this subject.
That haunts them by night and day; <i>afraid</i> of losing their
fat places, or <i>afraid</i> of not getting one at the next
election.</p>

<p>"There is one thing I wish they had more wholesome
fear of, and that is of <i>breaking the commandments of God
and of not doing their duty to Him, to their fellow-men,
and their own souls. A thousand times too much man!</i></p>

<p>"And that brings me to their <i>fear</i> of being too religious.
They are <i>afraid</i> the world will talk and laugh about them
if they do their whole duty to their Maker and themselves.
They are <i>afraid</i> they can't be so free to be wicked as they
would like to be. They are <i>afraid</i> they shall lose popularity
by the means; and they are <i>afraid</i> they shall have duties
imposed upon them which they don't like to perform.
They are <i>afraid</i> religion is a humbug, and are <i>afraid</i> they
shall be taken in by it; and especially they are <i>afraid</i> it is
a more costly luxury than they can afford to indulge in.
Perhaps they make up their minds, years ago, they will
keep free from the duties imposed by religion, so are
<i>afraid</i> they shall not be thought consistent, or still farther,
they are <i>afraid</i> of narrowness and sectarianism, if they
come out and confess themselves Christians&mdash;'<i>Too much
man, too much man!</i>'</p>

<p>"Even in literature the <i>ani</i>-MALS want to carry the day
and to frighten the publishers into their notions. Nobody
must write more than a dollar and quarter story-book,
especially if it happens to please the feminines. Pretty
well too. Supposing when I invited company I should go
round and say, you must not talk but just five cents worth,
and you ten cents worth, and you twenty cents worth.
But if one of the <i>ani</i>-MALS was present I should say, you

<!--- vol 2 page 185 -->

may talk a dollar's worth! what sense or propriety would
there be in that? or will the world ever come right if you
always give up to the <i>ani</i>-MALS?</p>

<p>"So they try to manage me, but they don't find it so
easy. No, no, Mrs. Pumpkin is not a ripe, round pumpkin
for nothing. She is going to have her say and tell it in
her own globular way, and not feel when her work is done
as a watchmaker would if he had left the main-spring out.
Nobody need to buy her book if they don't want it. Young
America need not buy it, if he likes his tobacco and confectionary
better. The colored people need not buy it, if
they like the first cauliflowers and new potatoes, and
earliest green peas, and prettiest flowers better. The
women need not buy it, if they like rich lace and moire
antique cloaks better than they do 'La V&eacute;rit&eacute;.' Just as
they please. This is a free country. But it is my book
and I am going to write it in my own way. A dollar and a
quarter! Pray where is the other seventy-five cents? Is
it a luck-penny, for pity's sake, that they hug it so close?
'<i>Too much man!</i>'</p>

<p>"Then with their corporations of all sorts, that squeeze
the souls out of people and leave them like my bouquet-holder,
very seedy at the end.</p>

<p>"They are going to control lecturers, are they? And
they get up a great rumpus if they don't speak just when,
and where, and how, and for how much they want them to.
What is the world coming to, with its suspicions, and its
falsehoods, and its denunciation, and its tyranny? Next
thing, they will be for putting a regulator upon the chestnuts
and walnuts, and especially the <i>beechnuts</i>, for dropping
in the autumn where they see fit, and especially if
they happen to light down in a little different way from
what they have been accustomed to have them. They
can't be made to believe but that there is mischief and
wickedness in any other mode than their own, though
beechnuts have never been in the state's-prison for crime,

<!--- vol 2 page 186 -->

that I know of. O, most righteous and pious community!
<i>Too much man!</i></p>

<p>"A still farther instance of the cowardice of the <i>ani</i>-MALS
is in committing suicide so often. If they lose their property,
or their good-name, or their friends, or their health,
or some favorite indulgences, or, indeed, if their wills are
crossed in any way by a good Providence, who knows just
what is best for them and deals with them accordingly,
why, ten to one they do not throw away the life given them
for the highest purposes. <i>Too much man, too much man!</i></p>

<p>"But the great <i>fear</i> of all which makes the <i>ani</i>-MALS
miserable, is of the women getting their rights. They
begin to be afraid of them at home and abroad, by night
and by day, on sea and on land, in public and in private,
in office, in business, and, indeed, it would be difficult to
say where they are not in <i>fear</i> of them!</p>

<p>"Now what is it that makes the <i>ani</i>-MALS, who have
heretofore thought that all the bravery of the world was in
their keeping, so timid? It really makes me uncomfortable,
it draws upon my sympathies quite too much to be
surrounded by so many trembling, frightened people. Do
they want to be petted like a little baby, thus?  'They
shan't be hurt, no, they shan't! The niggers shan't kill
them, no, no; the women shan't hurt them, indeed they
shan't! Hush, hush!' Why can't they be courageous, like
a woman. She sees no bugbears in the way. Slavery is
too delicate a subject to think of, much less to speak of
plainly, is it? A man is a fool, is he, if he gets up in a
religious convention and speaks about three millions of
slaves in a mild, Christian way? Again I ask, what are
the men <i>afraid</i> of? I don't hear of any crack of doom,
nor the Union falling to pieces if I cry <i>freedom</i> to the very
top of my voice, when I take my walk in the woods, and
if it were civil and in good taste I would just as soon do it
in the largest assembly in the land. Is not this a free
country? <i>Too much man, man, man!</i></p>

<!--- vol 2 page 187 -->

<p>"Mr. Pumpkin is a great trial to some people for being
a friend to niggers and women. It is very natural he
should be, seeing his wife is a woman and a nigger too.
Yes, I say, she is a white nigger. That is what makes her
know so much about their character and peculiar wants.
But that is thought no sufficient reason for his speaking a
good word for them; so one slams the door at him, another
shakes his head at him, another begs him not to say freedom
in his sermons, while another stays at home from
church altogether, lest he should hear the word <i>slavery</i>.
Again I say, what are they <i>afraid</i> of? To-be-sure Mr.
Pumpkin has committed one most incendiary deed. He
has given one woman her freedom, and that is Mrs. Pumpkin,
and there is no knowing what may come of it! If she
should take a fancy to dye her face black and crisp her
hair to rectify a mistake of nature, seeing she is a nigger,
he would only say: 'Is that judicious, my dear? However,
I wish you to act out your own genius.'</p>

<p>"One great cause of the <i>ani</i>-MALS being such a nuisance
in society, is their intemperance. Whisky, or wine, or
brandy, or beer must supply to them the liveliness which
the <i>Feminines</i> draw from the elements, from heaven, and
from their own souls. I don't believe there is one of them
that gets so <i>heady</i> as some friends of mine, I could name,
do on these pure spirits, their native-born intoxication.
And they never rave and murder their families like the
<i>ani</i>-MALS, either. <i>Too much man, man, man!</i></p>

<p>"If any <i>Feminine</i> young lady receives an offer of marriage
from an <i>ani</i>-MAL, I should advise her to conduct towards
him something like this. You know the <i>feminines</i> have
beautiful wings which set off their beauty to great advantage.
They live in the third heaven, and one of their
favorite employments, is to paint and draw the lovely scenes
and faces around them, while the <i>ani</i>-MALS crawl and
stumble down on the ground. Well, an <i>ani</i>-MAL looks up,
and says, 'Will you come down and marry me?'</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 188 -->

<p>" 'No, certainly not. If you wish for me, you must let
your wings grow, and fly up here.'</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is not inclined to take the trouble, but
hopes to succeed in his suit in some other way; so he
says, 'I have got plenty of money, and you shall have
some of it.'</p>

<p>" 'No,' (she keeps on drawing.)</p>

<p>" 'I have got a fine house and furniture.'</p>

<p>" 'No, I say.'</p>

<p>" 'I have got a carriage and horses, and servants in
livery, and my coat of arms is blazoned in full sight on the
coach&mdash;<i>Shanghai triumphant! Humble-Bee couchant!</i>'</p>

<p>" 'A very significant and startling device in these days,'
says the lady aside. 'The common breed of fowls did not
crow loud enough to proclaim the ignominy of <i>Humbugs</i>,
so some individual of the species imported these monsters,
whose harsh voices will finish the business of putting them
down, in a way they little thought of. But I'll not forget
to call out, No no!'</p>

<p>" 'I have got a library, full of Book covers, which look
just as well as books, and I'll give the key into your
charge, so that nobody need to find out the sham.'</p>

<p>" 'No, no, no!'</p>

<p>"He offers more inducements of the same sort, and protests
that he loves her dearly, but she knows well enough,
it is not of the quality to suit her, so she takes no more
notice of him, which is the best way to cure a grown-up or
a small child of teazing, and at length he leaves her.</p>

<p>" 'Dear, dear!' she says, 'what a trouble! now I have
got to paint this over again. What a daub! All the fault
of that <i>Ani</i>-MAL! when will the species ever get wings and
fly up into the third heaven, where we enjoy ourselves so
much.' <i>Too much men</i>, five million times <i>too much men!</i></p>

<p>"Now, I dare-say my book will be criticised by all the
aforesaid classes of men. One will be sure to pick out all
the little faults in it the first thing, and then very carelessly

<!--- vol 2 page 189 -->

finish by sayings 'the <i>spirit</i> is very good, and it answers
the purpose for which it was written.' Another will say,
'pretty well, but a lady in our place is going to write one,
which will be the best that ever was.' Another, 'I think
this writer was afraid of being dull and prosy some time,
so she made a great effort not to be. If she had put a few
more <i>goody</i> words in it, it would be better, and in one instance
she travesties Scripture very sacrilegiously, which I
am shocked at.' Another, 'a very remarkable style!
a-hem!' Still another, 'Pretty good! Some folks can do
more with an old jackknife than others can with a whole
chest of tools. I like her better, after all, than one of your
vinegar-faced Presbyterians. I'll shake hands with her,'&mdash;over
the fence. Indeed, very condescending isn't he?
And supposing I shouldn't give him a chance? I have
never wanted for agreeable acquaintances. <i>Too much
men!</i></p>

<p>"I suppose some people will say, that I have stolen their
thunder and lightning, and have not given credit for it.
Once for all then, wherever they see and hear it, let <i>them</i>
consider themselves quoted. I don't pretend to be a
<i>genius</i>, sent on a mission express from God's great white
throne, with a parchment all ready folded in my hand, a
pen stuck in my ear, and a bottle of ink hung by my side,
but I have grown up little by little, by seizing hold of and
assimilating to myself odds and ends of all creation, men,
women and children included, so that I am a living walking
Olla-podrida, with a touch of glory from the heavens
above, which everybody might have, if they would go the
right way to work to get it. And for these reasons, most
people will like something in me and my composition.</p>

<p>"Other women will come up, who will write better than
I do, but for this I shall always be remembered as having
given old lady Grundy the go-by, as no one ever has before.
Not that I would be disrespectful to her. She is a great
deal better than no guide, and until the world has made up

<!--- vol 2 page 190 -->

its mind to take Jesus for its master, and God for its
Almighty Sovereign, it had better keep fast hold of her
apron strings, else heaven save us from the men, <i>men</i>,
MEN!</p>

<p>"I haven't said anything about the <i>Commons</i>, because
there was nothing to say, as they have no settled opinions
or principles of their own. When they get some, I'll attend
to them. I think this chapter is nearly long enough. They
begin to be afraid already, I shall make two volumes of
my book, so that it won't sell, I have tried my best to
make whom it most concerns at this present time believe,
that I am going to be famous, but it is no go. I suppose
it is because I am only a common, healthy, happy woman,
and not like the pictures one sees in vignettes, of Religion,
clasping her hands and making wry faces as if it was
dreadfully hard, disagreeable work to be pious and thankful
to the best and most beautiful Being in the universe; or of
Literature, very tall and pale, with her head hanging one
side in an affected way, holding out a book; or Art, with
her brushes and pallet, looking up at the sky as if she was
quite too nice to do anything in this lower sphere. All my
trouble comes from my liking my liberty so well and choosing
to be mistress of <i>them</i>, instead of letting them govern
me. Heigh-ho! However, my publisher has got so far as
to say&mdash;'Seeing it is you, Mrs. Pumpkin, I will issue two
thousand copies of 'La V&eacute;rit&eacute;,' for the first edition. <i>Two
thousand copies!</i> Why don't he say two hundred thousand,
so as to have them ready when they are wanted!
Well, I shall have this consolation. When he is in a dreadful
hurry-skurry, ordering paper, and answering everybody's
demand of&mdash;'Have you got 'La V&eacute;rit&eacute;' on hand?'
'Where is 'La V&eacute;rit&eacute;?' '&nbsp; 'Will you send on five thousand
copies of 'La V&eacute;rit&eacute;?' '&nbsp; then I can say&mdash;'<i>I told you so</i>.'
I think the most prudent way will be to wait till 'La V&eacute;rit&eacute;'
is fairly out before I venture to say here, <i>Too much men!</i>
And so ends my first chapter."</p>

<p>"That is the way the women are allowed to write in
your country, is it?" said Hilda. "What a funny woman
Mrs. Pumpkin must be!"</p>

<p>"I expect they are concocting a second declaration of
Independence with the niggers to back them. Whew!
Strong-minded, too strong-minded! A fellow would like
to know under which category he is to be classed in these
new feminine times. Whew!" and Young America took a
cigar from his pocket, but looking at Hilda, and seeing that
she had her eye upon it, he put it back, and asked her to

<p>HILDA had become completely reconciled to Young
America by his bravery and disinterestedness and tender
care of her in the shipwreck, so she put very little restraint
upon herself in her intercourse with him. Not that
she would have allowed, even if he had, in the remotest
degree, approached any indelicate liberties, but she was,
as Mr. Pierson denominated her, a <i>hoyden</i> in this, her first
release from the somewhat rigid restraints of a punctilious,
conventional boarding-school teacher. One half hour she
would be joking and prattling with Mr. Sarran, and delighting
him by her half-filial, half-coquettish way of receiving
his caresses; the next, she would be listening with great
gusto, to some of Mr. Stephenson's extravaganzas of speech,
and impelling him on to his utmost limits of hyperbole,
by competing with him in his own favorite sphere. He
never was jealous of the favors she bestowed on her elder
admirer, because in his more expressive than elegant
phraseology he considered him a <i>goney</i>, and thought that
if, like an old worn-out war-horse as he was, he liked to
have the little colt <i>cavortin</i> round him, he wouldn't be the
one to put the bits in her mouth and rein her in. Give her
full tether and she would come back the quicker. The
fact was, he was in love with Hilda as far as he was

<!--- vol 2 page 193 -->

capable of being, while his own deepest feelings had never
been stirred by the revelation of the rich wealth of soul,
which really lay under her sunny, glittering surface. He
had appropriated her to himself about as coolly as he would
a brilliant tulip, or cloth-of-gold rose, by offering the tender
of a trifling coin. In Hilda, on the contrary, love was but
just stepping his tiny, graceful foot on the threshold, and
laying his thrilling hand on the portal of her fresh, maiden
being. If ever, for a moment, the joyous, unreflecting
present gave way to a dreamy glance towards marriage, it
was made rapturous through a sentiment which spoke to
her of more than all the poetry she had ever yet read or
conceived of, and of the pure hope of an added elevation
of character, through the sympathy and companionship of
another's gifted spirit, impossible to be attained by her
own solitary efforts. Therefore she was as little prepared
for the rude shock she received one morning, as Stephenson
was at the effect of his really honest expression of preference
for her.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; was sitting at her writing, when Hilda rushed in and
threw herself on the bed, in an agony of tears and sobs,
and broken exclamations.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, darling!"</p>

<p>No answer&mdash;but a fresh flood of grief.</p>

<p>"O! Zo&euml;, Zo&euml;! what shall I do? what shall I do? O, oh!"</p>

<p>"What is the matter? you frighten me. What has happened?"
said she, folding her arms about her.</p>

<p>"O Zo&euml;! if I had only minded you! Fool, fool that I
am! what shall I do?"</p>

<p>Zo&euml; caught a glimpse of the truth. "George Stephenson
has said something to trouble you, has he not?"</p>

<p>Another gush of woe.</p>

<p>"He can't have dared to be disrespectful to you! If he
has, I will appeal to Mr. Lindsey at once."</p>

<p>"No, no, don't; and if you will never breathe it as long
as you live in this world or the next, I'll tell you"&mdash;and in

<!--- vol 2 page 194 -->

a voice scarcely above a whisper, she said: "He asked me
to <i>marry him!</i>" And Hilda lifted up her voice and wept.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; must be pardoned if she could not avoid laughing,
though she controlled her risibles as much as possible.</p>

<p>"Is it so <i>very</i> bad?" said she. "I thought young ladies
liked to have offers, and to be married"&mdash;and her own eye,
for a moment, grew dreamy, and her voice faltered a
little.</p>

<p>"But he asked with very much the tone and look, and
manner that he did one of the ship's apprentices, the other
day, to <i>swap jack-knives</i> with him!" And she burst out
afresh, and covered her face in her pillow.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; laughed again to herself, then said:</p>

<p>"Dear Hilda, I fear I have done wrong, in not trying to
restrain you more; but I knew, as you said, that your heart
was innocent, and I could not bear to dampen your joy.
Then I have been happier than ever before myself, in what
I hope is the fulfillment of the purpose of God's giving me
my life, and my spirit has danced in harmony with yours,
my own, as it never has in the past. It has seemed to me
that He was at last granting me a childhood and youth in
one; for, O Hilda! I am old, old, measured as the harsh
world does not stop to measure in its superficial graduation.
So how could I mark so sharply, if your gladness
was leading you into danger, when it was but the expression
of my deep, still happiness, which has for its source
no earthly fountain, and looks for its fruition towards no sea
of this life, however blue and bright-tinted it may be? But
now I see that even in our most harmless pleasures and
purest delights, there must be some reserve, else we overleap
the bounds which our Father kindly plants around us.
He does it, that when we chafe and grow weary of restraint,
we may look yearningly upward to the blue sky,
whose unfathomable depths speak to us of the infinity of
bliss beyond it. That shall be ours, if we meekly garner
up some of our brightness and wealth of feeling and affection,

<!--- vol 2 page 195 -->

as seed to sow in the glorious future, where no rude
foot shall tread, or rough tornado bend low its flowering."</p>

<p>"Dear Zo&euml;, you always do me good, and I will stay with
you, and then I shall be safe. I have books to read, which
my friends gave me, and there is my drawing and embroidery;
and I want to translate the beautiful German poem
Mrs. Liebenhoff gave me, into English, so I will seat myself
by this window. I won't hinder you in your work."</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsey was sitting with Emma and Meta Pierson in
the parlor, and listening to their account of their visit to
Mr. and Mrs. Morgan. They described their impressions
of Jamaica life from the glimpse which they had of it, and
spoke warmly of the hospitality shown them, and admiringly
of the beauty of the youthful wife of Santa Anna.</p>

<p>"She has the true Southern eye," said Meta; "so full
of liquid softness, and yet there is a latent fire slumbering
in its depths."</p>

<p>"Have you observed Miss Carlan's eye?" said Mr.
Lindsey.</p>

<p>"Not particularly," said Emma.</p>

<p>"I wish you would do so; it is so full of soul, which is
such a characteristic of the African face."</p>

<p>"The negroes look very much alike to me," said Emma.
"I never used to be able to distinguish them; now I can,
of course, since I have seen so many. Miss Carlan is not
a negress, to be sure, but she has a decided taint of her
race in her person."</p>

<p>"She seems a very quiet, thoughtful little body," said
Meta.</p>

<p>"And for those qualities you would like her," said Mr.
Lindsey. "You do not appreciate those two young persons,
nor Young America either!"</p>

<p>He paused, and then said, "I wish it were the custom
to have broader views and sympathies. Society, in that
case, would get along much better than it does now."</p>

<p>"I don't pretend to be broad, I own," said Meta. "I

<!--- vol 2 page 196 -->

have my dear friends and associates, and try to think kindly
of the world in general. Then, as an artistic pleasure, I
like to go where I can see the common people, for human
nature in them acts out so spontaneously, and if there is a
remarkable specimen of any kind, I take it for a study,
and often get a great deal of amusement from it."</p>

<p>"Yes, and if you would do yourself justice, you would
say, too, 'I find satisfaction in sharing the bounties of
my lot with the poor and suffering among them;' and I
know you always gain the love of those you benefit. But
you don't like to give up the distinctive, artificial lines
which divide the different classes."</p>

<p>"No, I can't say that I do."</p>

<p>"In our own country," said Emma, "there are very few
barriers dividing different circles. I do not believe in the
common distinctions, caused by wealth or rank, but in
order to prevent the encroachment of the vulgar and ill-bred,
one must by the power of character, of attainments,
and of good manners, keep intruders at a distance."</p>

<p>"I agree most heartily to your idea in part. One
has a right, indeed, it is a spontaneous instinct of a pure
and delicate nature, to fold itself up, as it were, within
its natural defenses so as to guard itself from defilement.
But herein we disagree. You would make the reserve, the
exclusion of yourselves the rule of life, whereas I, having
more knowledge of, more confidence in, and more hope
of human nature would make it the exception. I think
one great means of raising the tone of life in our country
is by a more general mingling of the different classes."</p>

<p>"I do not. In our village, for instance, society has
always been excellent, you know. It is because a few
high-toned individuals have not only by their positive beneficial
influence helped to make it so, but also because they
have had the force of character sufficient to exclude inferior
elements."</p>

<p>"I disagree with you. Sects, cliques, and coteries impoverish

<!--- vol 2 page 197 -->

and vulgarize individual life and character no less
than the community at large, physically, intellectually,
morally, and spiritually. Human nature is very grasping
and capricious in its demands. If denied the legitimate
connections which God allows it, by making of one blood
all the nations and families of the earth, you will see the
bitter fruit, in the end, in the shriveled, deformed, diseased
body, the narrow, one-sided, mean type of mind, and still
meaner, more debased and groveling character."</p>

<p>"How can one endure the disgust, consequent upon
mingling with the masses on any terms of equality? Society
would lose all its charms for me," said Emma.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, a broad outlook upon humanity, generous
sympathies, a quick discernment of the best points of
character, an ever-living appreciation of the worth of our
common nature, would enlarge your enjoyment beyond
bounds. For you would then discover how much pure
gold was on every side of you, which you have looked
upon as only the baser metals. Life would have new
charms for you. It would give you a sense of freedom you
have never felt, and afford you an insight into the happiness
and extended sympathies of the glorified state.</p>

<p>"I have a letter from Mrs. Lindsey here, and I will read
an extract from it to the point, if you would like."</p>

<p>"By all means," said both of them.</p>

<p>It was as follows:</p>

<p>"As I look upon and mingle in social life in this new
city, more and more do I feel the necessity of the saving
power of the religion of Jesus being presented with
greater vividness and in a more thrilling way than any
man, however high-toned and faithful, can present it. The
masculine element, by which I mean coarse might, physical
and intellectual strength, has all along so predominated,
that men hardly begin to be cognizant of the mighty
<i>spiritual</i> power which underlies Christianity. It has ever
been taken for granted by the majority that these were

<!--- vol 2 page 198 -->

always to hold precedence. But it is not so. The feminine
element, whose crowning glory is <i>spirituality</i>, is only
gathering its gentle forces, to dissipate gradually, like the
morning sun's rays, the threatening clouds which now
envelop the country. If men do not see this, if they do not
read the signs of the new times, already dawning through
its subtle power, they would believe it no more, if it were
proclaimed from the housetops. But there are <i>women</i>
who know this, who have waded through their 'slough of
despond,' have greeted with trembling fear and joy the
flickering light upon its borders, and have found it no will-o'-the-wisp.
They have trodden for long, to their own
comprehension, on an equal footing with men in spheres
of influence and command, smiling when forced to endure
the grave discussions of philosophers, statesmen, and
divines, who are too dull to see, or too proud to acknowledge
their significance, but choose to wail at the incompetency
of their worn-out weapons of defense against
error and wrong, and still rely on their own weak inventions
for enforcing the truth.</p>

<p>"There is an intelligence among such women little
dreamed of, for it is more secret than Freemasonry, and
more sure than Knownothingism. They come not abroad
to proclaim their freedom, they spend not their strength in
denunciations, they waste but few words with each other,
but they know <i>their own</i>, and gaze with unblenching eye
upon the future, in which they shall enroll themselves for a
victory, gained without battle, and an onward march in
which they need no impulse but their own invincible trust
in the all-conquering spirit of their glorified Master.</p>

<p>"Of this regiment will be many whom the world calls
not worthy, who, from some pique and injustice, or, it may
be for some fault have been tabooed from <i>society</i>, but who,
in the solitude of their own souls, with their God for witness
and help, have struggled up from one height to
another, until, in the new order of things, they will be seen

<!--- vol 2 page 199 -->

far aloft in the upper sunlight, while those who banished
them with Pharisaical haughtiness, will, like Zobeide, look
up dazzled and amazed at the winged flight of what they
trampled upon as a creeping serpent. Birth, rank, fortune,
elegance, genius, intellect, beauty have been the watchwords
to band society together in the past, but in the future,
the soul is to bear sway. He or she who is willing to give
up everything earthly to save, enrich and enlighten his or
her own, and the soul of the world, will need no other
passport to enter into all its privileges and joys."</p>

<p>At this moment, dinner was announced. The party assembled,
and there was no more said upon the subject.
But Mr. Lindsey observed that both pairs of the young
people were gradually approaching each other, and when
the fruit was brought in, the mutual enjoyment of the incomparable
Jamaica oranges seemed to complete the sundering
of the barrier which divided them. Emma, who
was seated near Hilda, was evidently pleased to find her
much more than a hoyden&mdash;an intelligent, high-principled
young lady, while Meta and Zo&euml; seemed gratified that their
tastes squared so well in Literature and Art. Mr. Pierson
was charming through his elegance and versatility. Mr.
Sarran was made happy by his favorite's interest in him,
though more subdued in its expression than before, while
even Mr. Chichester, though, in his long grace he spoke
of them all as lost and ruined souls, who deserved
nothing but the wrath of God, yet brightened up somewhat
through the urbanity of Mr. Lindsey, and, as Hilda said,
"enjoyed his dinner as much as any of them, notwithstanding
their threatened doom." He even got as far as, in the
first place, to feel very sorry that such an amiable man as
Mr. Lindsey should be eternally lost, and afterwards to
conclude that he would not certainly be suffered to die a
Unitarian, and retired, that he might pray in the secret
of his chamber, that God would let him see his way clear

<!--- vol 2 page 200 -->

to become a Calvinist of the good, old-fashioned type of
the Assembly's Catechism.</p>

<p>As for Young America, it was very evident to him, that
his star was in its declination. There was no mistake now,
in Hilda's serious wish to avoid him. Emma and Meta had
never permitted his advances, indeed he had avoided
them and their brother, no less than they him. Zo&euml; knew
well enough that he was polite to her, simply on Hilda's
account; so when she saw him dejected and forsaken, she
did not, as she otherwise would have done, enter into free
and easy conversation with him.</p>

<p>Thus it continued for several days. There was a growing
intimacy between the other young people, but he was
entirely excluded. Mr. Lindsey, of course, was even
more than usually social with him. He did not understand
exactly the present state of things, but saw that
something was wrong between him and Hilda. But it gave
him an opportunity to see him in a different light from
heretofore, which increased his respect and interest in him.
He found him full of information, judicious in his opinions
upon society and life, and reformatory and humanitarian in
his tendencies. All that he seemed to need, was a firm
and rational Christian faith, whose principles were already
his admiration; and the softening, refining influence of
feminine society, of which he had been stinted for many
years.</p>

<p>Hilda said nothing of him even to Zo&euml;. The latter rejoiced
at the least indication in her friend of self-reliance
of soul. Of this quality in action, she had no lack, but it
had been her disposition as soon as she was in hailing distance
of a thought or a feeling to report it to some one&mdash;thereby
preventing her nature growing in depth in proportion
to other directions.</p>

<p>One day, they were sitting in the common parlor, devoted
to their party. Hilda and Emma were playing chess.

<!--- vol 2 page 201 -->

Zo&euml; was translating some favorite German poetry for Meta
to enjoy with her. Mr. Pierson was alternately listening
to them, and attending to the game, hardly knowing which
fair competitor to aid; for he had of late, found that Hilda
was both handsome and agreeable, while Young America
was walking in and out of the room, talking with Mr.
Lindsey, and eyeing askance their proceedings.</p>

<p>It boded no good to him, to see Mr. Pierson so attentive
to Hilda as he had been of late, and, though she conducted
towards him with great dignity, yet he knew his own deficiencies
too well not to fear the effect which the assiduities
of a handsome, elegant, highly educated man of refined
principles, tastes and sentiments might have upon her. So,
while there was increasing sunshine and laughter in the
group before-mentioned, there was a very threatening
storm in the <i>west</i>. It growled and thundered under the
dark cloud, settling over Young America's brow, and only
required a conductor of the slightest texture, from the opposite
point of the compass, to bring out an electric
explosion. This was soon furnished.</p>

<p>"So the women are going to take the ascendency in the
United States, are they, Mr. Lindsey?" said Mr. Pierson,
rising from his stooping position over the young ladies'
chess-board.</p>

<p>"Such seem to be the signs of the times."</p>

<p>"A pretty kingdom we shall have then," grumbled
Young America. " 'A chance world,' where a fellow
won't know whether next minute he'll be standing on his
head or heels."</p>

<p>No notice was taken of this.</p>

<p>"I hope the sovereigns will condescend to choose gentlemen
for their prime ministers," said Mr. Pierson.</p>

<p>"Queen bees must always have <i>drones</i> in the hive."</p>

<p>Mr. Pierson straightened up at this, and looked very dignified.</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 202 -->

<p>"I am curious to know precisely in what form they will
announce their decrees."</p>

<p>"Burst out crying, I s'pose, if a fellow asks them a
simple favor."</p>

<p>Mr. Pierson gave him a withering look.</p>

<p>"I wonder which of them will be next President?"</p>

<p>"The greatest flirt that comes handy," said Stephenson.
Perhaps he did not intend it, but his head, as he tittered
this rude speech, very evidently inclined towards the young
ladies of Mr. Pierson's party.</p>

<p>"What is that, sir? repeat that again, if you dare!"</p>

<p>"The greatest flirt thereabouts." Then looking round
the room, he provokingly added, "If the coat suits any
one, she is welcome to it."</p>

<p>"You are an insolent&mdash;dog"&mdash;was so nearly uttered,
that Stephenson caught the half sound of it, which Mr.
Pierson changed to 'fellow!'</p>

<p>"Dog!" said Stephenson, "I thought I did hear a little
puppy bark just now."</p>

<p>"Do you think I am going to have these ladies insulted,
sir; or myself either?"</p>

<p>Stephenson was provokingly cool. His wrath had subsided
just in proportion to Mr. Pierson's rising. He
walked to the window, looked out, and remarked to Mr.
Lindsey, that it was unusually warm. He guessed the
thermometer must be up to 90.</p>

<p>"You shall account to me for this, sir," said Mr. Pierson.
"You have insulted my sisters."</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsey rose to speak.</p>

<p>"I haven't insulted them," said Stephenson.</p>

<p>"My sisters shall receive no insult, which I have power
to resent."</p>

<p>"I haven't insulted them. You lie if you say so," said
Young America.</p>

<p>This was the climax. The cloud burst. Mr. Pierson

<!--- vol 2 page 203 -->

was high-spirited, of quick temper, though in his intercourse
with those whom he respected, very self-restrained,
and with a keen sense of honor. Anything which reflected
upon that or his truth fired him at once, and when roused
to the point of resentment, he blenched at no consequences
in the fulfillment of what he considered its laws.</p>

<p>He turned pale, and a settled purpose spoke from every
lineament of his face. His sisters were in agony, for they
knew him well. Mr. Lindsey tried to mediate, but he was
not heeded. His young friend retired to his chamber, and
in a few minutes Stephenson received a note from him
containing a challenge to fight a duel. He accepted it at
once, and the little party broke up in confusion and grief,
each to act as he or she best might, in these unforeseen
circumstances.</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsey first went to Horace and had a long conversation
with him, the close of which was this remark: "I
confess that my conduct is at variance with the Christian
standard, and that your principles are abstractly true. I
honor them and the life you and Mrs. Lindsey are enabled
to lead by their means. But I am a man in the midst of
worldly men. I should lose my character, and by that
means my influence for good should I rest ignobly with this
stain upon my name. Nothing but an acknowledgment
from Stephenson of its falsity would satisfy me. I commend
my sisters to your care if I fall. You know how
dear we are to each other, but I should love them less
were they willing that I should live at the expense of
honor. I thank you for your friendship, and feel confident
that it will never fail them."</p>

<p>A gleam of hope came into Mr. Lindsey's mind when
an apology from Mr. Stephenson was spoken of, as an antidote
for Mr. Pierson's injured feelings. He went immediately
to him. He was standing upon the veranda which
commanded a view of one of the ever-verdant mountains
of Jamaica, his eye resting upon a white cluster of buildings

<!--- vol 2 page 204 -->

upon its side, where a troop of English soldiers were
stationed, to be away from the sickly heats and malaria of
the town. A lignum-vit&aelig; tree stretched one of its branches
athwart its pillars, and he had plucked one of its lovely
blue blossoms, but was crumpling it up in his hands, apparently
without consciousness of what he was doing. He
turned as Mr. Lindsey approached him and showed the
traces of tears upon his cheeks. He brushed them away
indignantly and straightened himself up to his full height.</p>

<p>"My friend," said Mr. Lindsey, "though our acquaintance
is short, I do not miscalculate your generosity of
character in appealing to it as I am about to do. I come
from Mr. Pierson. I find him inflexible and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If he wants to be made mince-meat of he can be. I
never have missed my mark when I shot a coon. I have
brought the tip of his ear down many a time. I guess a
diamond pin or a seal ring will be as good a target."</p>

<p>"Can you talk thus coolly and boastfully of taking the
life of a fellow-being; a high-toned and truthful man; the
dependence of his orphan sisters; the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't want to fight with him, I say. Mr. Lindsey, the
quarrel is of his own seeking. The challenge is his own,
and do you think I am afraid of a rifle? I haven't been
among the Indians for nothing. I'll fight if he wants me
to, but he has got to take the consequences, that is all. It
isn't my fault."</p>

<p>"Yes, my friend, it is your fault. You were the first
offender."</p>

<p>"How, pray?"</p>

<p>"By speaking in the very tantalizing way that you did
of him and the young ladies."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to do with any young ladies of his. I
was not thinking of his sisters. And I should like to
know who is the oldest acquaintance of Miss Strophel,
he or I?"</p>

<p>"Does your length of acquaintance authorize you to

<!--- vol 2 page 205 -->

fling rude remarks at her? Is that the way you show your
interest in her?"</p>

<p>"How can a fellow help being mad when he is sent to
Coventry just at the minute he thought he was on the high
road to kingdom come?"</p>

<p>"I see where the difficulty lies. I have been something
of a student of human nature. Supposing I could say a
word to make you feel that your sentence of perpetual
banishment to that comfortless place was not entirely fixed
upon?"</p>

<p>Stephenson started and look him full in the face.</p>

<p>"I had occasion to pass Miss Strophel's door and I thought
I heard indications, which, if I were a young man, would
save me from <i>utter</i> despair."</p>

<p>"God bless you&mdash;if I thought so&mdash;but it is too late, too
late!" and he threw back his hat and wiped the perspiration
from his brow.</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsey paused a moment. "I came," said he, "as
I had no success in changing my friend's determination,
for he says, that without an acknowledgment on your
part, he will never withdraw his challenge, to appeal to
your magnanimity, by proposing that you should render
what is justly your duty."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" said he, brightening up. "I have
no objection to eat my words, if they are of the sort to
choke him so. I have no quarrel with him. I never thought
of his sisters. The fact is, Mr. Lindsey, I was jealous and
angry with Hilda, and I suppose, I whipped her too hard
over the others' backs for their liking."</p>

<p>"You certainly owe Miss Strophel an apology. Whipping
young ladies, in person or by proxy, is not the most
chivalrous way, to say the least, to treat the sex, much less
gain their favor."</p>

<p>"Well, the fact is, I see I am a regular brute, and no
mistake. I have been beaten about, most of my life, among
rude boys in college, in the woods, on the Rocky Mountains,

<!--- vol 2 page 206 -->

in hotels, and circuiting round in a wild country, so
that I am not more than half-civilized. I knew Hilda when
she was a little, wild, free girl. I always threw out whatever
came into my head and she would laugh at it, and
say that, when she grew up, she would come West with
me and live on a bluff. Of course, I thought then, it was
childish nonsense, but I have never forgotten it. I have
lain awake many a night in my buffalo robe, on the prairie,
thinking of her, and when I met her, it seemed to me,
what our minister would call 'a special Providence.' I
don't believe in such myself, and told him once, when he
kept dinging the doctrine into me, that a special Providence
had never got out west of the Alleghanies. But, as
I was saying, I thought everything would go smooth
between us; yet, somehow, I haven't been able to suit <i>her</i>,
when I thought I was on the lightning-train towards suiting
<i>myself</i>, at any rate."</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsey laughed. "Women are strange beings, I
own. I can't say I quite understand all that they are up
to, though I have been married nearly twenty years. But
I believe it is quite as much our fault as theirs, or, as my
wife would say, our want of thorough development. Men,
in these days, are too exclusively practical, intellectual,
coarse, and common-place, while the soul, with all its feelings,
affections, and sentiments, its soaring fancies, burning
imagination, and religious aspirations, is left in abeyance.
In a true woman, this is a vast realm; but if they live in
that, and we in our cold kingdom of abstract thought and
prosy world of facts, why, of course, we are constantly in
danger of losing acquaintanceship altogether, or else of
meeting at a great disadvantage. I am learning new lessons
every day, and I hope you will profit by your experiences
also. But come, we forget that Psyche is on the
tenter-hooks, this very moment."</p>

<p>Mr. Stephenson, accompanied by Mr. Lindsey, went in
search of Mr. Pierson, and found him in his sisters' room.

<!--- vol 2 page 207 -->

Emma was clinging to him, uttering entreaties mingled
with expressions of despair. Meta was sitting like a statue
tipped from its pedestal, and finding on his shoulder the
support for the classic head which would fall to the dust
if he did. Horace, with pale face and compressed lips
which told his agony, was trying to soothe them. Mr.
Lindsey tapped at the door, which was ajar, and then
opened it. Stephenson walked straight up to Mr. Pierson.</p>

<p>"I had no thought of insulting you, or your sisters, or&mdash;anybody
else, but if I was impudent, I beg your pardon.
I am a rough fellow at best, but my bark is worse than my
bite. Come, shake hands and let us be friends."</p>

<p>Mr. Pierson forgot his imperturbableness that had so
provoked Young America's criticism, shook hands warmly,
and responded heartily to his cordial greeting. Emma's
eyes flashed diamond-rays, while she even clasped Stephenson's
arm with both her own. Meta looked round
bewildered at first, but recovered her wits, and sat upright
with both hands raised and mouth partly open, but joined
in the laugh excited by Young America's ending the
scene, as he found his eyes growing inconveniently dim,
with "Well, it is lucky, after all, I didn't have to fight, for
the 'Doctor,' as I call my rifle, since it always lets blood,
is out of order, I am afraid, and if I had disgraced myself
by a bad shot, the coons would have hissed me next time I
went into the woods, and accused me of turning Homeopathist,
which don't do up our way. We go the whole figure
in medicine and surgery up there, and take quinine so, as
a regular dose, that we ring the church bell at noon for
everybody to pitch into it."</p>

<p>Hilda and Zo&euml; were in the next room, and overheard all
this conversation. Zo&euml; begged her friend neither to go
crazy, nor to eat her up entirely with her vehement
caresses. Hilda kept aloof, knowing very well where
her peculiar weakness lay. Zo&euml; went to the rejoicing,
and her more subdued happiness, at the termination

<!--- vol 2 page 208 -->

of the trouble, was not thought out of place by any one of
them.</p>

<p>Stephenson looked repeatedly towards the door for another
face, but as it did not appear, he went out seemingly
disappointed.</p>

<p>He need not be criticised too closely, to ascertain how
much his renewed hope in that direction influenced him in
this confession. That was in perfect harmony with his
frank, generous nature; and as God is so careful of our
virtue and true happiness as to grant us unnumbered props
to sustain it, and impelling forces to seek after it, it would
be but the part of ingratitude not to avail ourselves of them.
Our only care should be to have the central principle of our
actions one of eternal reference to Him.</p>

<p>After seeing most of the objects of interest in Kingston,
and bidding adieu to the few acquaintances they had
made, they left in the <i>Thames</i>, much to Zo&euml;'s satisfaction,
as she was impatient to get home.</p>

<p>THE circumstance which at first threatened to be so untoward,
through the timely mediation of Mr. Lindsey, and
the proper acknowledgment of Mr. Stephenson, proved the
means of uniting the different elements of the two parties
in the greatest harmony. The good effects of the reconciliation
were seen on all sides. Mr. Pierson and his sisters
unbent from their dignified reserve, and unfolded their
richly-stored minds, as a contribution for the general pleasure.
Young America, received on the footing his intrinsic
merits deserved, and seeing hope for himself in Hilda's
eye, though she kept at a distance from him, laid aside
some of his peculiarities, and retained only those which
served to spice their interviews, and give them the zest so
grateful at any time, but especially on board ship.</p>

<p>They were sitting together, looking at the receding city,
when Stephenson said, with one of his expressive 'Whews!'
"Glad am I to get out of that old tumble-down town. I
was afraid to breathe a full breath while in it, lest it should
fall about my head and ears."</p>

<p>"Emancipation has been the death of the Island," said
Mr. Pierson.</p>

<p>"I consider it the first symptom of reviving life," said
Mr. Lindsey. "The system of slavery had eaten out all

<!--- vol 2 page 210 -->

its heart and soundness; and the freedom given the blacks,
but revealed the rottenness of its condition. Now there is
some hope, after it has rested from its former drainage and
bad system of management every way, that it will eventually
revive."</p>

<p>Then followed a long discussion between the gentlemen
upon slavery in the abstract, no less than slavery in Jamaica.
The young ladies grew weary of the discussion,
and retired; and at length Mr. Lindsey and Stephenson
were left alone.</p>

<p>Said the latter: "The blacks never have proved that
they possess much mind or force of character, excepting a
single one here and there."</p>

<p>"And he should be regarded as indicative of the capabilities
of the race. When you paint a portrait, you consider
that you have a right to catch the very best expression
you can get, the idealized look, else you disappoint
the individual and his friends. So it is with these people.
Look at those branches of trees floating in the sea, do they
not surely indicate the vicinity of land? So, if one African
has manifested genius, to me, he is but a waif cast
providentially upon the shore of civilization to guide to a
full and tropical sea of mind&mdash;now flowing smoothly, fanned
by the gentle breath of the trade-winds&mdash;now rushing
with hurricane-force to its object&mdash;now imaging upon its
surface the variegated cloud-tints, or opening its bosom so
lovingly to the sun, that it colors the sea plants below with
its intensest dye, so that they are reflected to the eye of the
beholder. My friend, we speak of genius, talent, as distinctive
in gifted specimens of the race. But each of
God's children comes from His hand with the germ of immortal
powers, differing, it is true, in combination and character,
so as to make up a beautiful variety. All types of
human nature are necessary to the perfect development of
one, not in any subsidiary sense, but through a beautiful
equality of influence. Let us not be so infidel as to suppose

<!--- vol 2 page 211 -->

that so large a part of humanity as the African race is left
out of his category of high and beautiful uses, but accept
the indications appearing on every hand, that they are to
be a no less mighty, than mild and Christian influence in
uprising humanity."</p>

<p>"But their skin is the sticking point with me. Now,
confess, Mr. Lindsey, have you really got rid of all prejudice
against color?"</p>

<p>"What color do you mean? There are several hues
imposed upon the human face divine, which I not only
<i>pre-judge</i> unfavorably, but my <i>after</i> judgment is entirely
opposed to, also.</p>

<p>"One is the ruby color of the drunkard; another is the
chalky and green color of the sensualist; another is the
light-yellow, or cadaverous blue color of the fashionable
young lady, who dissipates, lies abed late, and whines at
the musquito perplexities of life, without trying to raise herself
above them. Another is the mottled saffron and brown
color of those who neglect bathing, exercise, and proper
observance of the laws of health; to say nothing of the
pink and powder tints dashed on to hide, in the quickest,
though not surest way, the ugliness of these colors. And,
my friend, you must excuse me, if I say that one <i>tint</i> very
offensive to me, is the dirty snuff-color superinduced upon
the sacred person of the image of the Most High by the
use of tobacco!"</p>

<p>Stephenson resorted to his hair, as was his custom when
he had not a ready answer.</p>

<p>"Then amalgamation is a theory of yours, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I profess to have no <i>theory</i> upon the subject," said Mr.
Lindsey. "I leave <i>theories</i> to you men of the world. I,
a student, an observer and a worker on the sphere of our
deepest nature, deal with <i>facts</i>; and I know, that from the
marriage of the whites with the Africans, has sprung up a
race in our midst, who, by the development, in every direction,
required by physical, intellectual and spiritual laws,

<!--- vol 2 page 212 -->

are equal to the duties of a complete manhood and womanhood.
This class is, in the future, to be a power, no less
mighty than subtle, to help carry on our country to its magnificent
destiny."</p>

<p>"Marriage! I did not know that there had been many
marriages between the blacks and whites."</p>

<p>"Not know it? Woe, woe be to this generation, who,
seeing with their eyes, perceive not, hearing, hear not,
neither understand. Not know it? It is because men live
in slavish obedience to the mere letter of the Word, in
Scripture, in Nature and in life, and are dead to their
saving, inspiring spirit. Not know, that if an immortal
spirit has descended from on high, it is the fruit of <i>marriage</i>,
though no priest may have pronounced the bans
nor ritual joined the hands, nor human laws proclaimed its
sanction! Young man, God has another mode of judgment
than that of sensual, mammon-ridden mortals, who think to
go quits, though by the wicked indulgence of their beastly
appetites they may tread the souls of their victims down,
deep in the quagmire of wretchedness and sin, while the
destroyer may ride on the popular will to the very acme of
power and applause. The electric potency may be long
in gathering, the lightning may restrain its sheeted flash or
its forked finger, even until the earth fills up the measure of
its preparedness, but, as surely as Nature never collects its
forces but to scatter them abroad, so surely will the bolt be
borne to its destined goal on the lines of conductors set
up for it. In like manner, will the thunder and lightning of
God's moral laws, for a time violated with impunity, just as
surely and by just as natural means be sped to the points
which the ignorant and disobedient have sharpened and
multiplied to invite their approach. It will do its work as
speedily, as surely as the first, and when the rude, but
healthful conflict of the elements is over, then will be seen
overturned and dismantled, the kingly oaks of the forest;
while the violet and anemone look up with clearer eyes to

<!--- vol 2 page 213 -->

the blue heavens, and glorify their Preserver by blooming
with a purer and more beautiful sheen than before. That
time is fast approaching. Let the unprepared quake and
turn from the evil of their ways, before it be too late."</p>

<p>"That is Unitarian preaching, is it? I have had hell-fire
thrown at me by the Calvinists most of my life, and somehow
it isn't of the quality to singe a hair of my head;
but I feel scorched by the flames you conjure up, from the
sole of my foot to the top of my crown."</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsey threw a penetrating glance at his companion.</p>

<p>"Not that I am guilty in the way you may suspect,"
said Stephenson. "No, thank heaven, if my mother were
alive now I could lay my head against her bosom, as pure
of <i>that</i> sin as when I slept a babe in her arms. I do not
owe this exemption from a vice which I can tell you, sir,
is rampant in the land, so much to principle as to a delicacy,
which, rude as I may seem, was implanted in me by
the precepts and example of my saintly parent. But I
have always despised the niggers, and I begin to see that I
may have been putting the boot on the wrong leg. Seriously,
though, as to their color!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, seriously. I have long ago ceased to be
prejudiced against any hue of the skin, which is normal,
which God, through a true obedience to his laws, shows is
best adapted to the purposes of a man's condition and
country."</p>

<p>"Should you be willing to have your daughter marry a
nigger?"</p>

<p>"I know of no negro to whom I should be willing to intrust
her, any more than to many an Irishman, German, or
even to you, my friend, American though you are. Nay,
start not. I would have my daughter marry one of such
high tone of mind and character, and with such pure
habits that I should know that, not only no dark cloud
would ever come across the fulfillment of her maiden

<!--- vol 2 page 214 -->

dreams, but that her husband would be the priest appointed
to aid her in her perpetual ministry at the altar of worship,
which her whole life, in its every varied scene, should be."</p>

<p>Young America looked serious then, shook his head,
and said, "She may, perhaps, find such a rare jewel for a
husband, but if I were her father I should be dreadfully
afraid she would die an old maid."</p>

<p>"Let her, then, as I know that she can be very happy in
a life of single blessedness. For she has been taught that
happiness is not a thing of circumstance chiefly, but the
result of a true development of soul, <i>more especially</i> to be
looked for by her in the future world. <i>More especially
still</i> is her marriage indifferent to me as I happen to
have no daughter but ideal ones, which, in these free
times, when children are born, are married, and die without
leave or license from those who should be their guardians,
are quite as safe and more obedient to me than any
tangible ones."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" Young America burst out. "I began to
think that if all the girls that I know, have set their standard
as high as you have, I might as well as not, say it was
a gone case with me, for I shall never get up to that
point."</p>

<p>"Why not, my friend? Why should man forever grope
about in swaddling clothes and go muling and puling
through this glorious world, instead of proving himself its
lord, the director of its forces, and, through a harmonious
correspondence with it, be the recipient of its best
blessings?"</p>

<p>Young America was thoughtful for a few moments, then
said: "Mr. Lindsey, I am not used to talking sentiment,
or if I happen to have any deep feelings, laying them open
to the world. But I feel impelled to say to you, that I
have always felt a want, a void which I never understood.
I have thought it was the love of adventure, which drives
me from one part of the country to the other, and never

<!--- vol 2 page 215 -->

allows me to be at rest anywhere. But I begin to think
it sticks so close to me, that going to South America, or
getting rich, or being a great lawyer, or artist, or&mdash;or getting
married even, will not free me from it. I am pretty
fast making up my mind that the want is in my own soul,
and if that is about right, other things will come along well
enough as a fellow happens to need."</p>

<p>"That is it, friend, only be in right relations with God,
nature, and humanity, through a full and Christian faith
and the work of life is done. What do I say? It is but
just begun on its truest, most blissful and glorious conditions.
By means of that, existence is no longer a scene
of disheartenment, inconsolable sorrow, and a constant,
losing conflict with the powers of evil, but a high-school
to prepare us to enjoy, to the best advantage, the future
play-time of our being, when, through the complete discipline
of our powers, the most active service in accordance
with their peculiar character, will be a perpetual hymn of
praise to the Most High."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; had now completed her Tale, for she simply had to
pen it upon paper from a full and glowing, yet serene and
joyful mind. What to do with it now was the question.
Hilda proposed that she should show it to Mr. Lindsey,
and if he thought it worthy of publication, he would offer
to take it to America and issue it from thence. To Zo&euml;,
who had written it, as she thought, by special inspiration,
the bare idea of its being declined or disapproved of
seemed impossible. It was not her work so much as
God's, who had simply used her as an instrument, through
the force of her natural powers and attainments, aided by
his Spirit ever given to the trustful and asking soul. How
could it then be rejected? She had an earnest in her own
nature, living and burning in every fibre and nerve, that
simple as it was, it still would be seen to be the condensation
of God's highest truth to the ages, and that the nations,
taking their departure from that point, would immediately

<!--- vol 2 page 216 -->

advance with rapid strides to perfection. Hence, she was
not prepared for the very subdued judgment of Mr. Lindsey
concerning it. Its truths were familiar to him, and he
recognized not the significance of Zo&euml;'s compilation of
them. He saw not, in her quiet, passive features and
mien, an evidence, which God vouchsafes to the earnest
soul, that, if it consecrates itself to any work, vast and difficult
though it may be, if its accomplishment is longed,
toiled for, and patiently trusted in and waited for, it surely
will be granted. Zo&euml; lived in the future, in Christ's glorified
reign. She asked for no worldly honor nor wealth to
spend profusely upon herself. She only saw and wished
for the time when, through the means acquired by the
publication of her book, she could carry out the completion
of Christian reform, but begun by the promulgation of its
truths.</p>

<p>It lay upon the table one day, for she cared not who
saw it now, and Emma and Meta Pierson and Young
America took it up. The young ladies turned it over and
thought it prosy and deficient as a work of art, and Stephenson
said he thought she used the word 'soul,' and two
or three others of the like import, too often. It was well
enough, but if it was published it would never set the Ohio
a-blaze, or the fame of it be hung out from the highest
steeple. Zo&euml; happened to overhear their criticism as she
passed through the saloon, though she neither revealed by
word or sign that she did so.</p>

<p>The ship <i>Thames</i> was sailing gradually on its way, stopping
at each island to deliver the mails.</p>

<p>When off Hayti, there were some sneering remarks by
the American passengers at the late disturbances on the
island, and the sanguinary proceedings of the full blacks
towards the colored people, and it was spoken of as an
evidence of their incapacity to organize and carry on a
government themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsey spoke of France as an instance of a Caucasian

<!--- vol 2 page 217 -->

people finding that same difficulty in their attempts
at a perfect republican state, and spoke of the miserable
condition of Europe generally in both her internal and
external relations. Then, why should this country, so
lately emerged from slavery, be judged more severely than
the more forceful and practical nations of Europe?</p>

<p>The party looked forward to being separated at St. Thomas.
Mr. Lindsey and his young friends would go on to
Barbadoes, where they would stay for a short time and
then come back to Santa Cruz. Mr. Sarran and his young
lady charges would cross over to that island as soon as
possible. Mr. Stephenson would go on to South America,
sailing as far as Barbadoes with Mr. Lindsey's party.</p>

<p>One evening the passengers were enjoying the sunset
from the deck, when gradually one after another went
below, leaving George Stephenson, Zo&euml;, and Hilda leaning
over the guards, looking at the phosphorescent light, which
rose and fell, and made perpetual motion by the rotation
of the wheel. Zo&euml; was trying to recall all the scenes of
her childish voyage to Denmark, by means of the shimmer
it cast upon the waters. She involuntarily parted a little
from her companions in order to have no disturbance to
the flow of her memory, and in the silence of her own
being to commune with the Infinite through this proof of
the presence of his spirit.</p>

<p>Hilda on seeing that Zo&euml; had left her side, rose from her
stooping position in which she was leaning over the guards
and was on the point of going below.</p>

<p>"Hilda," said Mr. Stephenson, "will you always be
afraid of me in the future? Return me the confidence
with which you formerly treated me. As a little girl, I
have always carried you in the purest part of my heart.
Do not let me go among rude and unprincipled men without
the safeguard, which, thinking that you did not despise
me in your beauty and youth, would give me."</p>

<p>"Despise you! O no, Mr. Stephenson! far from it. I

<!--- vol 2 page 218 -->

shall always remember my childish acquaintance with you,
with great pleasure, and I shall certainly ever think very
kindly of you in the future."</p>

<p>"And that is all, is it?" said Young America, giving his
hat an involuntary thrust over his eyes. "Well, I know I
don't deserve anything more, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hilda was going.</p>

<p>"I must tell you what is on my mind, whether or no,"
said he, giving it a toss back, showing a face, in which
love, bashfulness and bold determination were curiously
mingled. "Hilda, I feel as if I had lived ten years in the
last fortnight. I begin to believe in sudden conversions,
and take back all I said against the Dr.'s saving grace.
Even special providence, and the whole scheme of salvation,
interpreted in Mr. Lindsey's broad, Christian way, I
subscribe to, with all my heart; for I am a living instance
of the working of them all. I think really, that I have
met with a change now, and no mistake. You know I am
a rough fellow at best, and am no more worthy of a woman's
love&mdash;especially yours&mdash;than to have God's sun shine
on me, as it does every day, but&mdash;but, if I thought I could
ever gain it, Hilda, I would crawl on my hands and knees
to Jericho!"&mdash;Hilda could not help smiling in the midst
of her confusion&mdash;"or I could worship the ground you
tread on, instead. May I hope that, some time or other,
if it is not for a hundred years, I may make you happy in
my shanty out West?"</p>

<p>Hilda had been growing, too, for the last ten days, and
her ideas of love, though they might have lost some of their
roseate hue and lavender scent, had not changed in their
desire for its fervency and strength, and she saw there was
both in this characteristic offer of her childhood's playmate,
and now the lover of her youth. She did not accept
it, finally, for, of course, she must consult with her parents
first, and feel that her affection and hopes of the bright
and dancing future were sanctioned by their consent. She

<!--- vol 2 page 219 -->

promised him, however, that if he would not urge her
more, to let him accompany her to Santa Cruz now, he
might return there on his way home. She did not forget to
tell him before they parted, that "she should expect him to
bring her the present he promised her, especially the
streak-of-lightning wreath for her head-dress!"</p>

<p>"Hilda," said Young America, "I never saw so perfect
a man as Mr. Lindsey, in all my life. I could kiss the
print of his footsteps. He is the only harmoniously developed
man I could ever tolerate; for I used to think they
must, as a matter of course, be so smooth as to be stupid.
But he is the farthest removed from that. He is a saint
and Christian of the first water&mdash;and do you know that it
was he that gave me the first glimpse of hope, when I was
stuck in the snow-bank on the under-ground railroad, as I
call those dark days not long back, that I might, possibly,
some time or other, see daylight again? I wish I was rich,
and wouldn't I give him a farm, and build a church for
him, and give him three thousand dollars salary a-year?
Nothing is good enough for him&mdash;that is a fact!"</p>

<p>Zo&euml; rejoiced in Hilda's joy, and Stephenson's last prejudice
against her race evaporated, when she shook him
warmly by the hand, and told him that if she did not wish
so sincerely for Hilda's happiness, she should not congratulate
him; that she had full cause to know a truer friend
than she, never breathed; and that he had but just begun
to know the priceless worth of the jewel he had won. To
all of this, he most cordially assented, and wondered that
he had never before thought Zo&euml; very pretty, as he certainly
found her now.</p>

<p>Young America had hardly ceased to be jealous of Mr.
Pierson, though there was friendliness between them. But
he knew well how dangerous is the comparison between
elegance on one hand, and awkwardness on the other, and
mentally resolved, as he saw him walking the deck the
next day, to cultivate the graces more. He had scarcely

<!--- vol 2 page 220 -->

yet come to the conviction that a pure and loving soul,
whose highest aim is to do one's whole duty to God and
man in the little, no less than the great affairs of life, is in
a better school to learn a graceful and gentle demeanor
than in any seminary, professing to teach those accomplishments
by merely garnishing the external manners.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pierson is a real good fellow," said he, "and I
like him right well. He has been chosen Secretary of
Legation to Chili, it seems, and is going to cut across to
that place from Santa Cruz as soon as he arrives with his
sisters. I think he would make a first-rate minister, myself.
I hope he will get that office next."</p>

<p>"And his sisters are so high-toned."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it. A little too much Boston stiffness and
conceit about them; but one can't have everything, you
know."</p>

<p>"Mr. Lindsey says, he considers Boston the most advanced
city on the globe, if you look upon it in the light
of its religion, its general intelligence, its high sense of the
proper uses of money, its philanthropy, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, but the trouble is, it knows it all too well, and
that more than half spoils it. However, among so many
<i>views</i> as its ladies have, and so many <i>notions</i> as the men
have, it is not to be wondered at that a little self-consciousness
should creep in with the rest. But I have no quarrel
with them, Hilda, especially as you like them; so when I
build my shanty, I'll add a room on purpose for them, and
I know of young fellows out in our diggins, real quality too,
who would jump over the moon and toss up Venus as they
would an India rubber ball to get acquainted with them!
We'll have them out there. As for Zo&euml;, if kingdom-come
don't claim her before I get polished up to the right Christian
tone, she shall come and live with us. And if any
body dares so much as have the word color come into his
head, I'll knock him into the very heart of Africa. There
he shall shell out the coppers and the knowledge too, and set

<!--- vol 2 page 221 -->

such a first-rate example as a Christian missionary, that the
real live niggers, and no mistake, <i>there</i>, shall crowd to the
gates of heaven so fast, that Peter will have to let them in,
and never think whether they would pass muster among the
Calvinists or not! That's the way it is going to be, Hilda,
in the future, especially if Young America gets the sovereignty,
as it ought to."</p>

<p>"I shan't allow you to talk of sovereignty. I am a
republican, you know."</p>

<p>"I mean Mrs. Pumpkin's sovereignty of the <i>Feminines</i>,
where every one is to do about right, or else be rowed up
Salt River at once. All the States' prisons are to be up
there, and we'll see that they are properly ventilated, and
if the keepers and other officers don't do their duty in providing
proper means for the reformation of the criminals,
we'll hang them on our big gallows up there, so high that
they can see over the other side of the universe. That is
the way, Hilda. Reform is the order of the day out West.
That is the tune, and we'll sing it till the Rocky Mountains
burst out laughing so loud that the folks over the
other side of the Pacific will have to join in it whether or
no. So goes the world when Young America is engine-tender."</p>

<p>They soon arrived off St. Thomas and were received
into its pretty, sheltered harbor, and looked upon its red-tiled
houses, set one above another upon its steep hill-side,
making the town, as some one remarked, look like a colored
lithograph.</p>

<p>They all landed and passed the night at Bonelli's hotel.
In the course of the evening Mr. Lindsey read to the company
the following lines written by his wife, upon the
"Steam Engine," which he found in letters which had just
come by a ship direct from New York.</p>

<p class="small">THE STEAM ENGINE.</p>

</div>

<p>"WHAT shrill and shrieking
sound comes echoing through these
woods and hills at morning's dawn?
It speaks to me of the might of our
material life, of a civil state, gigantic
in its energies, untiring in its
labor for the gain of gold, and set
to the tune of a dominion over the
rude powers of nature, undreamed
of by the prophets and seen of older ages. Its rude blast
rends through the air like a trumpet blown by Cyclops,

<!--- vol 2 page 223 -->

backed by every heathen divinity of the Pagan times.
<i>Jupiter</i> is its name, fit cognomen for the engine whose
food is fire, whose breath is boiling steam, whose race-course
is the world throughout, its ministers every element
known to the ancients, and its high-priest, to do its bidding,
the shrewd intellect of the keen-sighted, forceful, daring
hero of our century's civilization.</p>

<p>"But hark! It gives a parting snort, as if scorning to be
held in bondage. It snuffs the air and tries its power to
be sure that, Samson-like, its strength has not been stolen
in its sleeping. On, on it comes, faster and still faster, the
rattling thunder of its wheels now mellowed by the shield
of hill or wood, now sounding louder and still louder as it
nears my vision. Thou genius, beautiful yet tremendous,
of this age&mdash;which with Titan throes gave birth to thee!
half war-horse and half eagle!&mdash;thou art the angel of the
covenant made between man and nature, revealed and
brought into familiar parlance with him by the laws of
Science. Thy pillar of fire by night and cloud by day are
the symbols to prove that heaven appointed thee to thy
mission. Thou wilt lead on our hosts to a greater, more
longed for, and richer inheritance than the promised land
to those, who erst were guided by Jehovah. For, through
thee, each continent shall open its stores of greater affluence
than Canaan offered. Not alone to a single people
is the promise given, but every land through earth's
remotest bounds shall, through thy aid, possess the Rich,
the Good, the Fair, and the Beautiful of every tribe, and
tongue, and nation. And thou shalt be the messenger to
carry to the heathen the tidings of Christ glorified.</p>

<p>"Ha! there thou art in all thy pride, and strength, and
majesty! I greet thee with joyful awe, my bird of mystic
form, and spirit-life, and power of double passage. I marvel
at the sturdy meaning of thy machinery as it turns and
turns, as if impelled by thought of the huge labor to be
wrought, to finish the creation but begun by God, to be

<!--- vol 2 page 224 -->

completed by his children. Thy war-horse portion shall
level the mountains, raise the valleys, scoop out the ledges
to make a fitting pathway for thy eagle-mate to fly without
impediment. Now she spreads her pinions, buoyed up by
the dense air made palpable and visible by the frosty breath
of Autumn. They stretch far hindward, reflecting brightly
the rising sun's rays, then float into the clear ether and are
welcomed to the bosom of the still atmosphere to be made
for a time its own, and when replumed by subtle process,
returned with added force and power again to thee.</p>

<p>"Shall I dare to intrude into thy presence, Jupiter, and
sue thee to act my servant to bear me to the city's whirl
and strife? Yes, for though mighty, thou art docile as an
infant to the mind which guides thee. Though thou art
great, still greater is the force of the immortal intellect of
thy priest and minister. Thus God appoints.</p>

<p>"O gloriously we speed through mount, ravine, and
field, now dive into the tunnel dug for thee, now cross the
bridge arched high above the flood, now skirt along the
precipice, now speed through throngs of gaping villagers,
who never tire of gazing upon thy lightning-train. My
spirit blends with thine in wondrous unison, and fire and
fancy, like a flame and flood, flow into my waiting soul as
I feel thy electric thrill in every motion of thy potent
being. Would I could consort more with thee, my Jupiter!
For thou hintest to me of the time when, by a more ethereal
spirit than thine own propeller, I shall be borne from
star to star, and be familiar with the vast spaces of the
boundless universe.</p>

<p>"But hark! a jog, a dragging motion and next a crash,
crash upon crash, in horrible continuance, and then a
plunge a hundred fathoms into the deep below.</p>

<p>"O misery and perdition! Shriek upon shriek, groan
upon groan, the dead and dying, the bereaved all huddled
together with thy ruins in frightful, direful masses! How
can humanity bear the sight, the sound, the feeling of the

<!--- vol 2 page 225 -->

woe, woe of the mangled form and face divine, the bitter
loss of near and dear by a fate so fearful; and last, not
least, the pictured scene which, like a ghost, will haunt by
night and day the memory of survivors!</p>

<p>"What is the cause of this awful doom on every side of
our wisest, best, bravest and loveliest? Does God frown on
the workings of the intellect with which our demi-god is
instinct? Does he condemn in threatening tones, and
punish worse than the infant world conceived of, because
the tree of knowledge has been seized upon and eaten
daringly?</p>

<p>"O no! but this is his behest. Heed it, my countrymen!
Learn it and be wise; obey it and be true to yourselves, to
the laws of nature, science, life, and your own souls.</p>

<p>"There is a power above the intellect, greater than your
most subtle skill and shrewdness, which should bear the
sovereignty in the world in which God rules, in part, and
gives in part into your keeping. It is his Holy Spirit
granted to every one who knocks and asks, and opens his
soul to gather of its fullness. The Holy Spirit! It will
teach you to lay no rude and careless hand upon this
sacred ark, freighted with the message of One God and the
history of his righteous dealings to the nations. It will
warn you to fashion it with true and honest purpose of the
most precious of the matter lavished all around us, created
for its special uses. It will cleanse your eye so as to detect
each latent flaw, prophetic of destruction. It will give
that careful conscience and tender moral sense to its priests
and ministers, so that sooner than peril the lives placed by
Providence at their disposal, they will cut off the hand,
the foot, or pluck out the right eye and cast it from them.
For what hell can be more awful to the awakened soul than
that opening to him who, through selfish ease, or thirst of
foolish fame, or paltry gain heaps up, demoniac like&mdash;his
hecatombs of slain, and sends their spirits untimely to their
last judgment! And more than all things it will utter its

<!--- vol 2 page 226 -->

rebuke, in trumpet-tones, where most 'tis needed&mdash;<i>on the
rulers of this great and mighty, but blind and striving,
wallowing, God-forsaking people; and on its rich and
prosperous, and scheming full ones in this world's wealth
and fatness</i>.</p>

<p>"Hark! do ye not hear the Spirit's awful voice, ye
proud and presumptuous, but poor, weak, inglorious seekers
for this world's renown, whose note of triumph shall
die away into a hiss of scorn! Listen too, ye mammon-worshipers,
who hug your <i>gold</i> for basest uses, and give
your <i>copper</i> for the Lord's anointed, and the great purposes
of his mission. Bow your heads and receive the
sentence, blowing in the harsh autumn winds, pouring
upon you in the raining floods, steaming up to you on the
deadly miasma's breath, roaring to you in the destructive
ocean's surge, while the six hundred shrieks and wails
which, of late, scared the sun from the heavens, and set
the thunder and lightning raving through the sky, shall
be the seal of your condemnation! 'Thou art weighed in
the balances and found wanting! The kingdom hath departed
from thee!'</p>

<p>"O ye servitors of the mighty war-horse eagle of our
civilization! Ye brakemen, flagmen, conductors, engineers,
firemen! do well each one thy work, for God, for
man, and your own souls! Relieve by your fidelity your
worn and ever-watchful, anxious superintendent, whose
soul is chained by sense of care and high responsibility,
and firm determination to fulfill each trust committed to
him, even though through neglect of his assistants a crushing
weight falls on him. Silence broods over even his
freest, happiest hours, for the trail of the serpent&mdash;fear of
evil through unfaithfulness&mdash;haunts him, though she, the
bright, sunny, ministering spirit of his home fain would
chase it far away. May she not tire nor faint in her loving
mission, for a better time is coming, when the Holy
Spirit's power will plume our eagle's pinions to safe and

<!--- vol 2 page 227 -->

rapid flight over the spaces, which our mighty war-horse,
who snuffs the peaceful battle, will level far and wide for
her victorious soaring."</p>

<p>"Hurra! for the Feminines," said Young America.
"Life-preservers will be at a discount at once, I see, if
<i>they</i> get the direction of affairs; and a fellow will dare to
go ten miles from home without making his will, or carrying
his ascension-robes with him, or even getting his health
insured, thinking he shall in all likelihood return to hobble
round with two crutches the rest of his life. Hurra for the
<i>white</i> Feminines, and <i>black</i> ones to boot! I begin to think
the age of miracles has come back, that I should live to say
that. Excuse me, Zo&euml;! I&mdash;I forgot, but never mind!
Hurra for Zo&euml;, and all her people; from Quashee up to
Soulouque, the Emperor. Every mother's son of them
shall be freed, or I'll divide the Union, and shoot the south
through my little brother's pop-gun, straight into a vacuum.
America is to be a free country in the future! She is to
wave her stars and stripes in the breeze without having a
long, black trail to them, with a slave-ship painted at one
end, and a flying-horse, which means the Africans, and
women of all hues tied to a plow at the other, with a
coarse, brutish fellow holding it, cursing and swearing at
the top of his voice, while a finely-dressed lady is on his
back, and her little boy, with a whip in his hand, is giving
him a cut every minute or two to make him go faster."</p>

<p>Mr. Chichester, who was sitting by, rose upon this,
shocked and angered, at the picture Young America had
presented to them.</p>

<p>"What is the country coming to?" said he, in a tone,
in which wrath and sanctimony were strangely mingled.
"What judgments from heaven will not be poured upon us,
when those who call themselves God's ministers, advocate
worldly amusements, talk in trifling tones with scoffers of
the <i>essential doctrines</i> of the Bible, and try to turn aside
the judgment of Heaven from those whom he has cursed,

<!--- vol 2 page 228 -->

and&mdash;" looking directly at Zo&euml;&mdash;"seeking to place those
who have the mark of this condemnation upon their very
forehead on equal footing with the Anglo-Saxon race,
whom he has commissioned to be the conquerors and rulers
of the world!"</p>

<p>"My friend," said Mr. Lindsey, "you have alluded very
plainly to me in these remarks of yours; I will be equally
faithful in asking, with all the earnestness which comes
from a deep-seated solicitude for the welfare of my country,
what indeed is it coming to, when the dominant
churches throughout the length and breadth of the land
meet together in synod, council and convention, to condemn
calisthenics, dancing, and reading of works of
imagination, but are silent upon, if they do not applaud,
the gigantic sins of the times&mdash;Slavery&mdash;which is but another
name for lust as well as oppression, Mammon worship
and Pharisaical bigotry? I commend this great question,
sir, to the consideration of the next meeting of the
American <i>Board</i>, and Presbyterian General Assembly."</p>

<p>Mr. Chichester turned on his heel and went out with a
half groan and half execration, and appeared not again in
their circle.</p>

<p>"The spirit of Calvinism impersonated!" said Mr. Lindsey.
"Glad and grateful am I that the rude ages are passing
rapidly away, when this stern and mistaken minister of
the ancient law, will be seen by our Heavenly Father to
have fulfilled his mission on the earth, and be permitted in
the course of his Providence to make way for the angels
of Peace, Hope and Love."</p>

<p>THE next morning, the captain
of the little sailing vessel, which
plies back and forth between St.
Thomas and Santa Cruz, came at
an early hour to Zo&euml; and Hilda to
inform them that he was all in
readiness to set sail.</p>

<p>There were friendly and affectionate
leave-takings between the
young people, and expressions of
the hope of soon meeting again.</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsey put into Zo&euml;'s hand a package of books,
saying: "These I give to both of you, if you will accept

<!--- vol 2 page 230 -->

this joint present from me. They are the writings of our
great and pure American moralist and spiritual leader,
Channing. I know that you will derive both pleasure and
profit from their perusal."</p>

<p>"Have you none of your own writings with you, Mr.
Lindsey? If so, please give me those too. They will do
me double good from having known and felt interested in
the author."</p>

<p>He went to his room and brought from thence several
volumes of Notes upon the Scriptures, which he had prepared
with a view, first to the benefit of the young people
of his parish, and then with the hope that, through a more
extensive spread, they might do something to revive the
failing interest in, and growing disregard of the sacred
volume. Then giving his arm to Zo&euml;, they followed Mr.
Stephenson and Hilda to the vessel.</p>

<p>It was soon on its way to the island of which they had
all through their childhood and youth dreamed and talked,
investing it with all the brilliancy and poetry which young,
ardent, and susceptible natures are wont to throw over distant
scenes and beloved ones far removed.</p>

<p>Mr. Sarran had seen to the safety of their luggage, and
now came and took his stand by Hilda's side as she
watched Young America waving his handkerchief towards
her receding figure, while she returned in like manner his
parting salute.</p>

<p>She was holding in her hand an engraving&mdash;Stephenson's
last gift to her, just as they were separating. It
represented a boat of antique form, filled with young
maidens in poetic guise, in gay rejoicing mood, with palm
branches and musical instruments of different form in
hand, just sailing away upon the smooth sea, enveloped in
the golden sunset atmosphere, with the new moon's bright,
silvery crescent clearly discernible just over their shoulders.
In the foreground sat a dark, stooping figure looking
grimly and mournfully at their enjoyment, his own lute

<!--- vol 2 page 231 -->

unstrung and useless by his side, indicating that the freer,
gladder song which these nymphs were tuning themselves
to sing would forever silence his own weird, melancholy
notes.</p>

<p>"I have called that old gentleman, there, Dr. Chichester,"
said Stephenson, in giving it to her; "but now I feel
as if it were myself. Do have pity on him, Hilda, and
take him into the boat with you as soon as you can. He
will merely ask to be helmsman, or anything you think he
is fit for. Only let him go."</p>

<p>"Be patient," said Hilda, "and who knows but he will
be captain yet. Those pretty young ladies don't look as
if they were fitted for, or wanted to spare the time from
their music, to row the boat or manage the sail."</p>

<p>"It is more than I am fit for, I am afraid, to take any
sort of control over those sylphs. But this I know; that
if a storm should come up and darken that bright sky over
their heads, which looks as if it were made on purpose for
them, I'd reef their sails and row them into the snuggest
harbor ever thought of."</p>

<p>"There will be no clashing there about each one's
duties," said Zo&euml;; "for they look as if they had arrived at
the sphere in which each one was doing what she was best
fitted for, so that there is no room for discontent or jarring
discords."</p>

<p>"You can interpret the picture as you please," said
Young America, "provided you will let me have a berth
in her, and allow me to give a helping hand to the one I
prefer above all the rest of the angels above or the saints
below. I only wish I was good enough, to call for my passage
from the lady commander."</p>

<p>"Captains don't have to call for their passage. They
have only to prove themselves worthy to guide the ship
safely round the world, and they take the supervision at
once. Until that time, of course, the Feminines, as Mrs.
Pumpkin calls them, must take the lead; but if they are

<!--- vol 2 page 232 -->

like me, I should be very glad to be excused from any
such conspicuous position."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; smiled at Hilda's modest relinquishment of one of
the governing qualities of her character&mdash;love of control&mdash;and
marveled at the power for remoulding the temper,
which a true affection gives. And so the Old and the New
World parted to meet, ere-long, never to be separated.</p>

<p>Mr. Sarran took the picture from her hand as she now
stood waving her handkerchief, excepting, as she lowered
it from time to time, to wipe the gathering tears from her
eyes. The title of the picture was: "Les Illusions Perdues."
He looked at it intently, then said, "the flight of
the illusions&mdash;the flight of the illusions," kissed his hand
to the nymphs and turned bitterly away.</p>

<p>Then Hilda saw the injury and grief she had caused to a
solitary and affectionate heart by her thoughtless coquetry.
She was full of remorse and sorrow at the idea.</p>

<p>"Who would have thought, Zo&euml;," said she, "that such
an old gentleman would once think of a young flirt like
me, excepting in a grandfatherly way? I don't understand
it."</p>

<p>"The pure, loving, and honest soul, if living in accordance
with God and nature's laws, never grows old, dear,
remember that," said Zo&euml;. "Its environment may decay
and drop to the earth to mingle again with its sister atoms;
but the inner spirit, if obedient, is renewed, expanded
and perpetually glorified, through its ever-nearer and closer
communion with its Infinite Source. Never presume upon
the want of susceptibility of any human being, for either
the highest or the most ardent emotions of which human
nature is capable, but treat every one, as before God, you
would wish to be dealt with, knowing, as you do now, its
quivering sensibilities, and then you will be safe from
danger of wounding another, or degrading or paining
yourself."</p>

<p>Hilda was very serious, and wondered that there should

<!--- vol 2 page 233 -->

always be a shadow cast over every enjoyment. But without
appealing to Zo&euml;, as had always been her wont in her
psychological questionings, she reflected long enough to
have the conviction take root in her mind, that God has
such ever-watchful and tender care over us that he kindly
places guardians to defend us from pride and presumption&mdash;those
giant enemies of the soul&mdash;through a painful
inner experience, or by the chafing of some outward circumstances
against it sufficiently to keep it quickened to
the point of unrest in the present, that the future good may
be the more eagerly sought for.</p>

<p>Another cause of solicitude to Hilda was Zo&euml;'s interior
life as well as her outward prospects. She understood
pretty well now, how she would be looked upon in the conventional
state of society they would find in Santa Cruz.
But besides this, she read in her friend's face and manner,
that the excitement under which she had written her
Tale, was passing away, leaving her prostrated in health
and deeply dejected in mind.</p>

<p>It was true that a terrible revulsion was taking place in
Zo&euml;'s whole being. She was of a highly susceptible, nervous
organization, which had never been taken much into
account in her training, so that imperfectly disciplined as
she was, in the practical and common-place departments
of life, it combined, with her vivid and ever-active imagination,
to distress and perplex her. Her health was suffering,
first from being overtaxed in her studies, and now
by the transition from a temperate to a tropical climate.</p>

<p>Like the balloon of fragile texture and workmanship,
which carries within it, at the same time, its own propelling
force and its sure cause of ultimate destruction, so
Zo&euml;'s soul flamed up and flickered hither and thither with
every movement of its delicate car, threatening to consume
the latter and dissipate its sustaining, ethereal element to
the four winds of heaven.</p>

<p>She understood not yet the intimate connection there is

<!--- vol 2 page 234 -->

between the corporeal, the mental, and spiritual constitution,
therefore, when her spirits sank to a lower tone than
ever before, in proportion to their late elevation, she
thought it must be from some perverse sinfulness in
herself.</p>

<p>The work, which, subdued in its tone as it was, had
been a lyric to the Most High, now seemed mean and dull,
and filled her with disgust.</p>

<p>In vain, as she approached the termination of her voyage,
did she strive to rise above her depression. How could
she meet the parents from whom she had so long been
separated, who had sacrificed so much for her, with heaviness
of spirit and the inanimate expression which revealed
but too plainly her want of interest in life, or anything that
pertained to it! But the greater her struggles the more
signal was her spirit's defeat. A mountainous weight settled
upon it, a heavy pall folded itself over her, unaccountable
even to one whose life had ever been so unjoyous as hers.</p>

<p>In this mood, her eye fell upon her manuscript. It glared
upon her as if it were the ghost of every fast-fleeting
vision of her childhood and youth. "And this is all that
my whole life's aspirations have been able to make real!
Fool, fool that I am, to separate my mind from the actual,
until I feel strange and forlorn in the world in which God
has placed me to be useful, and among my fellows, whom
it was intended that I should benefit, but whom, by my
presumptuous dreamings, I cannot now bring within the
sphere of my possible influence. You, at least, deluding
cheat, will I sacrifice to the manes of every hope and desire
of the future, which I but too plainly see, are never
more to revisit me."</p>

<p>She seized it impulsively, and tying it to an orange
which Mr. Stephenson had given her, was on the point of
dropping it into the deep.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, Zo&euml;?" said Hilda, startled from
her reverie, for even she could dream now. "Your manuscript!

<!--- vol 2 page 235 -->

you are crazy;" and she threw an alarmed look at
her friend's face, while she caught hold of it.</p>

<p>"Less than ever before, Hilda, for now I see what an
idiot I have been all my life! As if <i>I</i> could write anything
fit to read. Give it me, dear; I never want to see it
again."</p>

<p>"No, no, indeed! Give it to <i>me</i>, Zo&euml;."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you will show it to some one."</p>

<p>"No, I will not. Only give it to me."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; felt too little spirit or interest in anything to contend
about the matter, so her infant production went away not
only from the gaze of the world, but she who gave it birth,
after a whole life's throe of untold agony spurned it from
her as a poor, worthless, unacceptable expression of her
love for her Master, and with sinking despondency, saw no
other way in which she could glorify him.</p>

<p>They were now within sight of Santa Cruz. The emerald
green of its fields of sugar-cane, the deep verdure of
its forest trees came out gradually to the eye, and their
aroma to the scent, as they approached, and now the low-roofed,
veranda-circled houses, the clusters of negro huts,
and then the barracks and custom-house, with its arched
oriental-like entrance, stood before them. The boat was
lowered, the luggage secured, a few strokes of the oar
given to the gentle waiting Caribbean, and its child, who
had so tenderly and tearfully yearned for it in her exile,
was borne lovingly upon its waves to the shore.</p>

<p>The passengers first went to the custom-house, to submit
to the examination of their luggage. Hilda and Zo&euml; were
standing at the door, looking around for a hackman, when
a dark, grave man sauntered in. He started on seeing the
two girls, looked admiringly at Hilda's tall, elegant figure
and animated face; then upon Zo&euml;, and exclaimed, "My
child, can this be you?" and the next moment she was
folded in her father's arms!</p>

<p>O susceptible, sensitive, thrilling soul of woman! giving

to thy sympathetic, fleshly envelope hundreds of eyes,
myriads of ears, and the power of reading the inner
thoughts and feelings of the world about thee, and of
retaining to it from the fountain within thee, either an
inspiration to high endeavor and strength to accomplish
mighty deeds in the inner and the outer life, or Circe-like,
alluring to death, or, what is worse, to the spirit's bondage
to sin and evil! Heed well the power invested in thee,
and it shall be a ministry to lift thee and thy fellows
heavenward&mdash;neglect or pervert it, and it may drag them
and thyself down to the lowest Erebus!</p>

<p>Through this subtle magnetism of an etherealized spirit,
Zo&euml; read in her father's eye, in his somewhat constrained
manner, and his brooding brow, that he compared her unfavorably
with her brilliant companion, and that he was
disappointed in the result of his life-long labor and sacrifice
for her. This, of course, only threw a deeper shadow
over her spirits, and unnerved her for the meeting with her
mother. Hilda and she separated at the custom-house, the
former saying, as she bade her good evening, "I shall see
you to-morrow:" and in a few moments she was folded in
her mother's embrace.</p>

<p>"This, my child, was dead and is alive again; she was
lost and is found!" said Sophia, in the rapt language in
which she now often expressed herself.</p>

<p>Zo&euml;'s life had been one of yearning and unrest. In her
outpourings of sentiment, she had always coupled her
mother with the cravings of her deepest nature. She had
felt that, if she could but once be pressed to her bosom,
new life would be given her, and that she should start up
quickened as from a second and conscious birth. How
different from the letter was the reality! She had but just
strength to totter towards her, and, for the first time in her
life, swooned entirely away.</p>

<p>MRS. STROPHEL was surprised at the arrival
of Hilda thus prematurely, and delighted to see her beautiful
development of person, and self-possessed, dignified
carriage. Mr. Strophel was too infirm in body and mind
to notice her with very warm and continued interest, but
asked her repeatedly, "How she left the health of their
majesties in Copenhagen."</p>

<p>Alice, the younger daughter, looked wonderingly at her,
and divided her attention between her newly-arrived sister
and her spaniel, for an hour, and then ran away to have an
undisturbed frolic with her pet.</p>

<p>In the evening, her two married sisters, who resided in
Fredericstadt, came in to greet the new comer. One of
them, Mrs. Warrington, who had been educated in England,
thus living away from her home for many years,
seeming to understand what Hilda's feelings would naturally
be on coming home to so many stranger relatives,
seated herself by her side, and caressed, and spoke to her
in tones of endearment and warm affection.</p>

<p>But the great subject of interest and never-ending talk
was the insurrection, the conduct of the blacks, the advent
of the Spanish soldiers, their departure, together with discontented
references to the conduct of the governor-general.
So that Hilda soon gained the impression that this
beautiful Eden, which had risen to her vision from the

<!--- vol 2 page 238 -->

waves of the azure-tinted sea as she gazed upon it, was
made the abode of discontent and strife by artificial usages,
false and barbarous customs, and the lack of the life-inspiring
influence of the pure and simple religion of
Jesus, freed from heathen admixtures.</p>

<p>Before she retired, she communicated to her mother her
attachment to Mr. Stephenson. She was minute in her
inquiries of his parentage and standing in society, his
fortune and his prospects in life, and the result of her
conversation with her daughter was her expression of satisfaction
at her future prospects.</p>

<p>The next morning on rising from breakfast, Hilda said,
"I must go and see Zo&euml;."</p>

<p>"My dear," said her mother, "I hope you are going to
drop your acquaintance with George Carlan's daughter."</p>

<p>"Mamma!" said Hilda, reddening from sudden excitement.</p>

<p>"Of course, you will not continue your foolish school-girl
friendship with that lowborn Quadroon. I don't like it
very well, that Miss Ingemann permitted it. Did she think
that <i>my daughter</i> was worthy of no better companion?"</p>

<p>"Zo&euml; is a <i>lady!</i>" said Hilda, "and more than that, she
is the most precious soul that ever lived; and dear mamma,"
she continued, with enthusiasm, "she is my beloved and
most valued friend!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Hilda, what will be thought of you, if you
are seen among the colored people on any terms of equality?
I can't permit it, and there is nothing more to be said
about it"&mdash;and she went out to give directions to her servants.</p>

<p>Hilda obeyed so far, as to say no more about the matter,
but went immediately to Zo&euml;. She looked ill, and she
knew that she was sad, but was evidently trying to make
herself at home with her father, and to interest herself in
her mother's occupations and little family arrangements.
Some of her cousins came in to see her, and them she

<!--- vol 2 page 239 -->

received with great sweetness, though Hilda knew how
painful it must be to her affectionate nature, to find among
them none who could give her companionship, excepting
in her most trifling hours. She mentally resolved to be
more to her in the future, than she had ever been.</p>

<p>Towards evening, Zo&euml; and her mother walked upon the
sea-shore, and had it not been for the weight of disappointment
at the non-fulfillment of her religious dreams and
aspirations, her deadness of interest in the present, and
her growing anxiety for the future, both in this world and
the next, she could not but have drank in with delight the
charms with which a tropical sea, sunset and perennial
verdure enriched the landscape around her.</p>

<p>She was not disappointed in her mother. She was
simple, affectionate, pure and a true and ardent lover of
Nature, and she longed to be able, as she laid her head on
her breast, to unburden the woes of her soul. But that
she could not do, even to her, for she felt that to her
parent's circumscribed mental vision and comparatively
narrow imaginative outlook, the revelation of the dreams,
of which she was compounded, so entirely had she blended
her whole interior life with them, would make her start
back aghast; or, if she should reveal her disappointment
and consequent depression, it would be the means of separating
them heaven-wide apart, through the natural rebuke
she would give her. So she labored on with that
heaviest and most discouraging burden, a sick, weary and
remorseful soul. With her father, she felt under continual
restraint. He was superficial in his philosophy, worldly in
his aims and desires, and narrow and one-sided in his
judgment of human nature and character. He was a disappointed
man, because he had looked for the uprising of
himself and his race, through external power and worldly
advantages, instead of through the patient, steady growth
of character and soul. Even if Zo&euml; had appeared in her
most favorable light, he would not have been satisfied, for

<!--- vol 2 page 240 -->

he wished her to be a showy, striking, handsome person,
with obvious energy and force of character, and that loftiness
of demeanor which impresses the shallow, and compels
outward adherence and a show of respect, though the
inner spirit may all the time chafe, curse, despise, and
slily use all possible means to evade its influence.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; strove to be social and lively, but this was harder
than all besides, for as it was not in accordance with her
darkened spirit, she shrank from expressing what she did
not feel. She reflected more and more upon the failure
of her hopes, more and more did her self-respect leave
her, more and more glaring did her lifelong mistake weigh
down her whole being.</p>

<p>Thus week after week passed away. It did not matter
to her that she was not received into the social circles of
the whites. Had she been so, it would not have enlarged
her estimate of herself&mdash;that she was ignored by them
did not change her opinion of her own deserts. To God,
she had always looked for approval and impulse&mdash;from Him,
she had hitherto received a full measure of inspiration and
encouragement.</p>

<p>Once only, did she show the least symptom of resentment
at the prevailing prejudices against her caste, and its
disregard of justice in its blind adherence to the floating
surface of things.</p>

<p>She had made the acquaintance of a Santa Cruz lady at
Mr. Liebenhoff's, to whom she had brought letters of introduction,
and it had so happened, that she was able to pay
her many little attentions, and give her, in several instances,
valuable aid in settling herself comfortably for a summer
residence in Copenhagen. Hilda, on the contrary, not
taking a liking to her, and being occupied with her own
affairs, paid her scarcely any attention. Now, however,
Zo&euml; ascertained that Mrs. Orlandsen had given her blonde-haired,
pale-complexioned friend, letters of introduction to
her wealthy relatives in Bassin, who were most assiduous

<!--- vol 2 page 241 -->

in paying her various attentions in the way of invitations
to visit, to ride, and to sail with them in the little pleasure
excursions got up from time to time in that part of the
island. Her pensive face glowed for a moment with resentment
at this ingratitude and disregard of the common courtesies
of life, but it was soon unheeded in the experience
of what was of infinitely more moment to her; for the
fearful and heartsinking feeling possessed her, that, by her
blasphemy in likening herself to the Messiah, she had forfeited
the favor of God, and therefore he had withdrawn
from her his support, protection, assistance and communing
Spirit. Her debilitated health, the entire change of
her associates, the discouraging effect of seeing the low
condition of her people, her father's unhappiness and evident
disappointment of his last hope of rising in social
life through herself, all tended to make her miserable.
The memory of Miss Ingemann's dislike to her, her disapproval
of the style of her mental and psychological
development, added to the condemnatory words of Dr.
Chichester concerning her race, which she had overheard,
the sense of its wide-spread debasement, giving apparently
some sanction to the idea, increased her dismay.</p>

<p>But the overmastering cause of her wretchedness was
the conviction that, through an undisciplined imagination,
she had brought ruin upon herself and dragged down upon
her guilty head the retribution meet for the proud, presumptuous,
and self-exalting soul. Then came bitterly to
her mind the warnings of Mrs. Liebenhoff against unrestrained
fancies, and she saw, but too late, that she had
sinned against the clearest light and the wisest counsel,
and in the same proportion to her wicked neglect of them,
would be her punishment and doom. A less reserved and
delicate nature and a less self-sacrificing temper would
have relieved itself by expressions of some sort, even
though it might not have met with full sympathy or appropriate
aid. But it was a part of her nature, as has been

<!--- vol 2 page 242 -->

already said, to reveal herself no farther than she met with
a response, and the bare thought of increasing her mother's
trials, and diminishing the comfort she could find in her
recovered child, kept her mouth almost entirely closed
upon the subject of her misery.</p>

<p>She entered with all the energy of which she was
capable into her domestic occupations&mdash;for her father's
diminished means made some personal labor necessary to
them&mdash;both from a desire to relieve her, and bring her own
mind also in contact with the practical and common-place.
She would select the most difficult and disagreeable duties,
and faithfully perform them, though her mother would beg
her to desist, and would watch, with tearful eye and a heart
full of tenderness, this fragile being stemming the current
of the rude world's uses. A lily she seemed to her, sitting
like a spirit of light above the thick river mud, or amidst
the green slime of the stagnant pond inlet, with no defilement
upon its pure petals, only its central star-rays folded
from sight either by its own lack of power to open them in
scenes so unmeet for it, or, by the sickly heaviness of the
circumambient air.</p>

<p>In her wish to bring herself into kindly relations with
her people, she would frequent the market when the
negroes brought of their produce for sale. But they loved
not her father, they were jealous of her superiority of culture,
and they either coldly returned her greeting, or more
decidedly evinced their want of friendliness to her by a
muttered reference to her outlandish education.</p>

<p>Hilda was with her daily for an hour or two, and sought
indirectly to rouse and cheer her. Her mother pretended
not to notice her visits to Zo&euml;, though she well knew she
was disobeying her wishes that she should drop the
acquaintance; but an inferior spirit, if at all intelligent,
learns to dread coming into collision with one superior to
itself, knowing how it will be worsted in the encounter.
As this was the only instance of her displeasing her, she

<!--- vol 2 page 243 -->

was silent upon the subject, though she strove to keep the
friendship of Hilda for Zo&euml; a secret from her conventional
friends.</p>

<p>One day she was sitting chatting by her side, telling one
incident after another which would, she thought, interest
Zo&euml;, and not being over-careful of exposing the family jars,
which occasionally happened in Mr. Strophel's abode.
She lacked Zo&euml;'s delicate sense of propriety, which, like
the magnet, always settled at the true point of the compass,
and having been away from her family all her life,
she had not the peculiar pride in its appearing always to
the best advantage, that would be sufficient to counterbalance
her sense of the ludicrousness of some of the scenes
enacted within the walls of her home.</p>

<p>"O Zo&euml;!" said she, "you don't know what a funny time
we had yesterday at the dinner-table. Two English gentlemen
dined with us, of the true British stamp, seeing
nothing but their country and her glory above the horizon,
every button upon their dress-coats an institution, and to be
honored in the closing accordingly. Papa, as he always
does, got upon Denmark, and the court, and their majesties,
and enlarged upon them to the satiety of the guests.</p>

<p>"I tried to relieve them by turning his attention to some
other subject, but did not succeed. Major Lanman, seeing
me in distress, came to the rescue, as he thought, by saying,
'Mr. Strophel, I am delighted with Santa Cruz. It
seems strange to me now, that I have never before given
myself the pleasure of visiting you (meaning the island
of course). I have often been at St. Thomas.'</p>

<p>"Papa smiled and bowed in his most courtier-like way,
and said, 'Indeed, I hope you may never have that pleasure
again!'</p>

<p>"The Englishman looked grim at first, but his feelings
changing suddenly, I thought that he would burst, in trying
to keep from laughing, and then that he would certainly

<!--- vol 2 page 244 -->

grow tipsy by seeking to cover his confusion by his wine-glass."</p>

<p>She paused a moment, then said, "I see you do not
think it is quite right to repeat these blunders of my respected
relatives, but really, Zo&euml;, it is quite a difficult matter
always to be governed by the fifth commandment, in intercourse
with those who have always been strangers to you,
especially if they do such provoking deeds as papa did
the last evening."</p>

<p>"What was it, dear?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't you think, that he has taken a fancy to
making a gallery of the fine arts of our bath-house. He has
the twelve apostles in Parian marble on brackets here and
there, and this morning, I found he had cut out some of
the handsomest engravings from that expensive and beautiful
book, cousin Harry gave me, as we were leaving London,
and stuck them up over the bathing-tub and washstand! Is
it not too bad?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry you left the volume where your father could
appropriate it to himself. You know you told me before,
that it was his habit to select for his own use, without
regard to meum and tuum. It is a pity, surely."</p>

<p>"O, Zo&euml;, I need you every hour in the day, to prompt
me to do right, and lead me into careful ways, instead of
having to steal in the manner I do, to see you."</p>

<p>Zo&euml; started. "Then your mother is unwilling to have
you visit me?"</p>

<p>"I thought you knew, dear, that there is no bottom to
the iniquities and absurdities which the system of slavery
has entailed upon the white people of this island. One is,
it has eaten up their souls, leaving them with just about as
much capacity of perceiving rightly the eternal truth of
things, as my great century doll with Mr. Andersen's spectacles
on. They see only people's skins, and their favorite
hue is that of skimmed milk, very, very blue! It seems

<!--- vol 2 page 245 -->

to me, that the whites have only a skin-deep religion, skin-deep
politics, skin-deep political economy, skin-deep literature,
skin-deep morals, skin-deep education, skin-deep
tastes, feelings, affections, and judgment of character.
There, dear, never dare again to think that I am not a
philosopher. I have spelled that out all by myself, and I
have come to the conclusion, that if some of the other
races don't rise to their proper position and sway among
the nations, that the world will shrivel all up like an old,
dry piece of parchment and blow away into the sea in the
next hurricane. What do you say about it, Zo&euml;?"</p>

<p>"I am thinking, Hilda, that you ought not to come and
see me, if your mother has forbidden it."</p>

<p>"I am a woman, Zo&euml;, and I must do as I think best."</p>

<p>"But we must honor our parents here, and obey them,
while we are under their guardianship."</p>

<p>"It is of no use trying to make me think, that it is my
duty to give up my love for you, or not to show it by coming
to see you, and there is an end of the matter."</p>

<p>"But can't you have a talk with your mother, and let
her see that it is a settled principle with you, rather than
a mere school-girl feeling? I think she can't but respect
that in her grown-up daughter."</p>

<p>"That is true, Zo&euml;. I will do that very thing, for I
don't feel quite right to come to you so slily as I do. It is
unjust to you, no less than to them and myself. You are
always so good, dearest, and direct me so beautifully!
How can I ever live without you?"</p>

<p>"No, Hilda, don't call me so any more, I am wicked;"
and her face expressed all the despair which this feeling
caused her.</p>

<p>"You wicked! Yes, as wicked as that white cloud sailing
by, glorified as it is by the sun's rays shining upon it!"</p>

<p>"Hilda, I am wicked, wicked!"</p>

<p>Hilda took another turn to try to comfort her.</p>

<p>"Well, dear, so am I wicked, as wicked as all out of

<!--- vol 2 page 246 -->

doors, as George would say. I despise my father, I hate
my mother, and dislike all my other relations, excepting
sister Warrington, and if that is not being wicked, I don't
know what is. And as for this poor, forsaken little island,
I feel so imprisoned in it, and weary of my bondage, that I
should like to take it up in my hand and toss it over to the
coast of South America. Then wouldn't I give it into the
keeping of somebody, that would shake it into a sensible
way of thinking and acting? Wouldn't I?"</p>

<p>Zo&euml; made an effort to smile.</p>

<p>"And seeing we are both so wicked now, we will have
a nice little time repenting of our sins, and to-morrow
morning wake up all new, and pure, and good as need be!
Won't we, darling?"</p>

<p>Zo&euml; shook her head despondingly.</p>

<p>"O my dear little friend!" said Hilda, folding her in her
arms as if she were a grieved child; "I wish I were good
enough, and broad enough, and deep enough to console
you; but I am not; so I can only love you dearly and pray
to our Father to take the very best care that he possibly
can of you."</p>

<p>"Yes, Hilda, nobody but He can aid me, and the worst
of it is, I have gone beyond even his help, I fear. But
why do I trouble you? It is better for me to keep my feelings
to myself, and if I am ever to rise from my depression,
it must be by communion with Him alone."</p>

<p>"That reminds me," said Hilda, "that mamma proposed
that I should go to St. Thomas to-morrow, to see
my married sister there. I did not like to leave you, but
perhaps I had better on your account."</p>

<p>"Go, dear, by all means, and before you come to me
again, speak to your mother about it and get her consent."</p>

<p>Hilda promised, and the two friends separated for a
brief season.</p>

<p>HILDA had a cousin on the
father's side, an officer in the Danish
regiment stationed at Santa
Cruz, who was educated in one
of the German universities. He
had occasionally visited her while
at Misa Ingemann's, and always
manifested a good deal of interest
in Zo&euml;. She never had liked him
very much, as his style of character and his conversation
harmonized very little with her own.  He was deeply

<!--- vol 2 page 248 -->

imbued with the latitudinarian philosophy, so rife at the present
time, was ultra rationalistic in his religious belief, an
advocate of <i>free love</i>, and quite superior to all church
ministrations and ordinances. He came to see her now
with Hilda occasionally, and showed an undiminished regard
for her. Though Zo&euml; never thought of love in connection
with him, he was more tolerable to her than
in Denmark, simply from her having so few intelligent
associates and from his being connected in her mind with
many of the works of art in Copenhagen, which they had
visited together.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Carlan were members of the Episcopal
Church, now under the care of a young clergyman from
the United States by the name of Marland.</p>

<p>The Danish government, as has been said, was striving to
raise the free blacks by giving them equal social, as well
as political privileges with the whites. In the churches it
frowned upon any dividing lines, either by the appropriation
to their use of inferior seats, or in the administration of
the ordinances. Still old customs had great power, and it
required more courage and effort than the majority cared
to evince, to take the position in all cases allowed them by
the laws.</p>

<p>In the communion service, it had been the habit all along
for the whites to come up to the altar to receive the elements,
then the free colored people, and lastly the blacks.</p>

<p>One Sunday Mr. Carlan was at church. His wife was
not well and Zo&euml; staid at home to attend upon her. Possessed,
as he was, by the spirit of rivalry&mdash;knowing what
his rights were as a free citizen under the Danish government&mdash;when
the first communicants went to the altar, he
also arose and mingled with them as they knelt to take the
emblems of his meek and lowly yet sublimely tempered
Lord. Mr. Marland was disconcerted at this unusual
demonstration of independence from a colored person; he
knew the prevailing feeling with regard to this very man's

<!--- vol 2 page 249 -->

assumption; he hesitated a moment, then passed him by,
and gave of the cup and bread to the white communicants
first.</p>

<p>Mr. Carlan returned home very much incensed, threatening
to inform the magistrates of this disregard of the Danish
law; which menace the next day he carried into execution,
and the church, in consequence, was ordered to be
closed, until the excitement among the colored citizens
should be allayed.</p>

<p>His wife tried to soothe him, but in vain. Zo&euml; attempted
to turn his mind to a higher view of this trying circumstance;
but stung to desperation as he was, it was of no
avail, but, on the contrary, brought upon herself a verbal
expression of his disappointment in her.</p>

<p>It needed but this scene and those stinging words to
complete Zo&euml;'s despair. She said nothing, but her spirit
groaned in its deepest recesses at its incompetence either
to direct aright her own meditations, or to strike the
key-note which would reduce to harmony her father's discordant
nature.</p>

<p>"Woe, woe is me!" she said to herself, "that with this
fearfully quickened perception of what is the only true
good of our being, I should be manacled and chained by
the abuse of my powers so as to be nothing but a useless
weight, an incumbrance in the sphere which I should fill
to completeness, and adorn, in accordance with the privileges
bestowed upon me!"</p>

<p>When she was no longer needed by her mother, she
walked out towards the sea-side and sat down upon a fallen
tree in a grove whose boughs almost bent over the waves.
Not a breath of air stirred a leaf upon the tree over her
head, the sky wore a lurid look, and a stagnation was in
the atmosphere such as betokens a hurricane. This was
not, however, the usual season for one, so to Zo&euml; it seemed
but the sympathy of nature with her, or, rather, its reproach
dramatized in this way, to enforce more surely to her

<!--- vol 2 page 250 -->

deadened, powerless existence the fact of her being only
a cumberer of the ground. She felt as if she should stifle
in the heated unelastic air. She threw back the hair from
her temples and bared her neck to be free from resistance
to any possible passing breath, but it did not relieve her.
She thought that the curse of God had settled thus palpably
upon her head, she felt its crushing weight, its stinging
hiss and mocking syllables were in her ear, its awful message
was written upon the heavy, dark cloud which hung
low and threatening in full view before her.</p>

<p>At this moment the cousin of Hilda, Lieutenant Tileston,
came and seated himself by her side. She half shrank
from his presence as she always had, yet now that her
being was awry as it were by disease and mental suffering,
she had come to distrust the gentle warning which a pure
soul gives out to its possessor of the approach of danger
or defilement. It was a relief at this fearful moment to
have any human form approach her.</p>

<p>"Zo&euml;," said he, "I am ordered to St. Thomas with my
troop, and I have come to see you before leaving."</p>

<p>"Hilda has already gone there you know," said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"I have no interest in Hilda, Zo&euml;; you are my soul's
complement; without you I can no longer live. Do you
not see how a magnetic sympathy drew me towards you.
I knew not of your being here, but the force of the affinity
existing between us impelled me towards you. O go with
me, Zo&euml;, my love, my twin spirit, and a true marriage without
the slavery which priests or laws impose shall be ours
through time and eternity."</p>

<p>One cause of Zo&euml;'s wretchedness was the separation
from her kind, which an exaggerated idealism, unrestrained
by a proper discipline of the social and practical elements
of our constitution ever imposes. She was solitary in the
midst of living, sentient humanity&mdash;lonely and forlorn with
the busy, pleasure-loving world on every side of her. And
now, O soul-crushing, heart-quaking thought! Nature,

<!--- vol 2 page 251 -->

whose fondling she had lovingly called herself, frowned
upon her in every phase of its manifestations; and the Infinite,
whose peculiar child she had reverently thought she
was, turned rebukingly away from her, or chided her in
each intimation of his Providence! What wonder, then,
that she should catch at the slightest hint that the great
Father above and the tender mother below were relenting
towards her and indicating, through the sympathy of one
human being, their pardon for her sinfulness!</p>

<p>The young man saw the impression his words were making
upon her. He was on the point of laying his arm on
her shoulder to draw her towards him. She looked quickly
in his eye, and started up as if a serpent had stung her,
for she read plainly in its glance a selfish, unbridled passion,
a destructive, ungovernable lust. The spirit of divination,
which ever possesses one who purges herself from
earthly pollution and looks up to the heavens calmly, longingly
and perseveringly, came back to her with full sweep
and potency.</p>

<p>"O! Genius of the universe, of matter and of mind!" she
exclaimed, as with form erect and arm up-lifted, she looked
first up to the heavens, and then with withering and majestic
glance upon him who sat gazing astounded at her
feet. "Now I know why thou sufferest the polluting breath
of concupiscence to fall upon thy undefiled! It is that she
may gather into her heart of hearts the multitudes of her
poor, seduced, betrayed, abandoned, lost and ruined sisters.
I see them everywhere&mdash;a man-forsaken, woman-scorned
throng. They cast their imploring eye up to thee, O pitying
Father, in the field&mdash;they cower, frightened and dismayed,
in the hut&mdash;they stand rigid and passive upon the
auction block&mdash;they smile sicklily, in satin and lace, in the
harem&mdash;they flaunt boldly that they may conceal their despair
in the streets; and, O misery and perdition! they
curse and wail, and bemoan their pollution of soul and
body in the brothel, and die, and are cast out as worthless

<!--- vol 2 page 252 -->

weeds into the highway. Come to me, O come to me, ye
poor, lost, ruined, man-forsaken, God-forsaking frail ones!
I will lift you out of the mire of the roadside; I will bind
up your wounds, both of the body and soul; I will place
you in safety from the foot of the destroyer. And when,
through the spirit of our tender, forgiving, life-inspiring,
crucified Master, ye have come to be clothed in your right
mind, O! then I will point you to the glorified Christ, and
ye shall help to bring on his triumphant reign. While
those, (and she pointed her finger with scorn at the Lieutenant,)
who selfishly have torn from thee, Psyche, thy delicate
wings and trampled them in the dust, shall cower and
creep away into the thick darkness to repent for thy wrongs,
and learn, in humiliation of spirit, how priceless is thy
worth before God."</p>

<p>She ceased, and before the man had recovered from the
mental stupor occasioned by this new revelation of power
in one whom he had thought so plastic and gentle as to be
moulded as he saw fit to his purposes, she had glided from
his sight and taken refuge in the embracing trunk of a silk
cotton-tree near, where she waited until he should leave
the vicinity.</p>

<p>He rose, looked around, and seeing nothing of her, the
thought came into his mind that she must have dissipated
with the dense atmosphere. A bird of the parrot species,
called by the negroes, the 'Black Witch,' at that moment
flew out from a shrub near, circled over his head for a moment,
and then soared away.</p>

<p>He put his hand to his crown, uncovered as it was, on
account of the heat, as if a condemnation had fallen upon
it, as the bird fluttered past him; he bent his form, so proud
and self-sufficient but a moment before, and shrank away,
a pitiable instance of high-flown imaginings, and most paltry
and mistaken doings.</p>

<p>O miserable, short-sighted philosophy of the unassisted
reason! which leavest the truths of the ages condensed in

<!--- vol 2 page 253 -->

the sublime religion of Jesus, to piece out for thyself a
shapeless, stained and meagre reliance for the ever-living
soul; to form, for its guidance, a compound of fanaticism,
superstition, pride, self-conceit, bigotry and Pharisaical assumption,
with but just enough truth hanging loosely to it,
to delude without saving from sin! why dare ye show
your wrinkled, blear-eyed, harlot-front before the sanctified
religion of the cross? How have ye the fool-hardy courage
to come with your scarlet, blood-stained, bespattered
garments into the precincts of the sacred courts, and compare
your faded, tattered cloak, which but scantily hides
your deformity, with the seamless robe of the Christ, or
offer your stingy, mammon-crusted, man-seeking gift upon
God's altar of the Holy of Holies!</p>

<p>Ye shall roll up from inherent lack of ability to preserve
yourself from unseemly furrows and folds! Ye shall pass
away in the muttered sighs of the confessional, the dead
forms of the rubric, the fiery, yet icy dogmas of the Athanasian
creed, in the vain whinings after the leeks and
onions of a dying and receding intellectual belief, and in
the rappings and table tippings, which are but presages of
the electric might of the rising majesty and sure victory
of the religion of Jesus.</p>

<p>The soul will, first or last, reclaim its full rights, and if
it recovers them not in the legitimate way, it will scare and
make fools of the gaping multitudes by wizard-like demonstrations
and ridiculous or fearful manifestoes. It is for
man to give it its just and proportionate sway over the present,
and the future will be sure to slide gracefully and
beneficently into its fitting and harmonious locality and state.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; came out from her hiding-place when she was
sure of being left alone, the momentary excitement
of her nature abandoning her to a still deeper and darker
depression.</p>

<p>She tottered a few steps, and then threw herself upon
the ground in her agony.</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 254 -->

<p>"Woe, woe! is me that I have lived to endure insult and
the offer of pollution. This never would have been, had I
not forfeited the favor of the pure-eyed One above. Were
I worthy to be shielded by Him, I should pass unscathed
through the direst dens of defilement without drawing upon
me the evil glance of corruption. Why, why am I permitted
to live in the universe of his holiness! Better is it
that I should sink into annihilation than to be a blot on His
lovely creation!"</p>

<p>Her hand fell upon a manchineel apple, under whose
parent tree she was prostrated. She seized it, and the
thought of self-destruction rushed over her, for by swallowing
that, she would soon lie lifeless under the bleaching,
torrid sun.</p>

<p>"And murder, too, is added to my catalogue of sins!
O, that I should live to fill up the measure of human
iniquity!"</p>

<p>At that moment a vivid streak of lightning, followed by
a crashing clap of thunder, rent the air. The wind swept
down the gulleys and ravines along the declivity of Mount
Victory, which bounded one side of the spot where she
was sitting. A hurricane sent forth its fearful blast, as a
signal of her everlasting damnation.</p>

<p>She bent low her head for a moment, as if in submission
to its heralding trump of doom. Faster and faster fell
the rain-drops, louder and louder shrieked the whirlwind
in its sweeping passage by her. An instinct of self-preservation
impelled her to look around for a retreat from its
fury.</p>

<p>She discerned, at a little distance, a disused sugar-house,
and she rushed frantically towards that, and had just time
to enter it and crouch down in a corner when the full force
of the tempest sped over her.</p>

<p>In fearful unison with its raging was the frenzy of her
mind.</p>

<p>"Roar, O ye tree-tops!" chimed in her disordered

<!--- vol 2 page 255 -->

spirit with the sound of their waving branches. "Ye echo
most fittingly the rage of hoary ocean at my youthful, yet
old as Cain sanguinary imagining!</p>

<p>"Scream out your scorn, tempest, at the weak virtue
which cannot look the deceiver into Hades! Hurl your
thunderbolts, dart your lightning, thou electrical Spirit, at
the presumptuous one, who ascribes to herself a more
than equal share of thy smiles! Rend the earth, uproot
the kings of the forest, thou tornado, which shakest in thy
fury the proud uplifting spirit of the presumptuous Zo&euml;!
O sea, which I have proudly called mine in tones of endearment!
meet is it that thou upbraidest my pride by
sweeping over thy barriers and threatening to overwhelm
me!</p>

<p>"Hush! what is that image, frightful, and cruel? It is
the press where my poor, helpless people are ground to
the dust, and their life-blood bespattered upon the pavement
of stone. The caldrons, the caldrons! They are
full of the mangled limbs of my own. The hogsheads are
brimming with their terrible woes. In the distance I
see the treadmill, where, faint and fearful they stumble,
crying, 'Massa, pity me, dear massa! For God's sake
relieve me!' And there is the scourge, all clotted
with gore, its whip braided of the long hair torn from
the brow of the murdered. And now the distillery stares
at me. From its alembic of all conceivable horrors,
exhales to the heavens, the souls tried as by fire! Ha! is
it not right, that God should destroy the earth, steeped to
the brim in its sins? Yes, yes, the wicked are cut down
by the hot breath of his nostrils. Now it sweeps over the
town, carrying destruction and ruin in its path!</p>

<p>"The men and women tremble, as well they may, at
this fearful retribution. We are overwhelmed, we are
buried in the wreck of the world. Hear its frightful shock
and shiver, as it splits and overwhelms the sinful, devoted
nations! 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what

<!--- vol 2 page 256 -->

they do!' " shrieked Zo&euml;, as an uprooted tree fell across
the roof of the sugar-house.</p>

<p>The sound of her own voice above the boom of the elements,
recalled her a little to herself, and brought back the
ever-recurring attempt to trace her mind's history back to
the time when she first fell into her ruinous habit of day-dreaming,
to which she had of late attributed all her subsequent
trials. She clutched in imagination at the period,
when she lay a happy, contented infant of three
years in her mother's arms, or tottered by her side
on the sea-beach, pleased and satisfied with the sight
of the blue and violet-tinted waves of the sea of the
Caribs. Ever since that time, she had spurned the present,
and lived in the future, but that brief period of
her remembered infancy, came up to her mind like a
backward hope of retrieving the past by amendment
in the future.</p>

<p>At that moment, her father rushed in, having come in
pursuit of her, and had traced her to her retreat, by
her scarf which had fallen from her, not far from the entrance.</p>

<p>"My child," said he, "why are you here?" Filled
with the recollection of her innocent, contented childhood,
she stretched out her hands to him as had then been her
wont, saying, "Take me into your arms, papa."</p>

<p>The strong man folded her to his bosom weeping for joy,
and as he strode homewards over uprooted trees, braving
the encroachments of the ocean's surge and the angry
force of the elements, ay, even treading upon the wreck
of his goods by the storm, he felt a new thrill of joy
through his being. For in Zo&euml;'s infantile petition and
clasp of his neck, as she fell into unconsciousness, he felt
that he had not only recovered his child in lieu of the
changeling which she had brought to him in her sadness and
reserve, but, that he had in a measure, found his own lost
self as he was, when comparatively at peace, he had watched

<!--- vol 2 page 257 -->

with Sophia, the gambols of their darling in front of their
veranda. He gave her tenderly into the arms of his wife,
who, as she laid her worn and wearied frame upon the
couch, thanked God, who had thus brought her precious
one "out of much tribulation."</p>

<p>"All her excellencies stand in her so silently, as
if they had stolen upon her without her knowledge.

<p>A LOW, lingering sickness followed
this strain upon the physical
and spiritual nature of Zo&euml;. She
lay unconscious of all outward
scenes and impressions, though her
inner world was peopled by a multitude
of shapes, and was the sphere
of incessant psychological workings.
At first, she was in great distress, struggling with
phantoms, and fighting with fearful dreams, but gradually

<!--- vol 2 page 259 -->

she grew more quiet, her face recovered its placid expression,
and at length she settled into a deep and unperturbed
sleep.</p>

<p>Her parents watched over her, as if their life's happiness
were chained to the frail tenement which inclosed
the precious spirit of their child, and many were the questionings
which forced themselves upon the mind of George
Carlan. He was learning at last the lesson of dependence,
upon a surer stay than the world's breath of popular favor,
a more certain mode of exaltation than wealth or ambition
can furnish.</p>

<p>Hilda heard accidentally, in St. Thomas, of the illness
of her friend, and hastened home to be with her.</p>

<p>"Mamma!" said she, with the decision which characterized
her, while her commanding figure and noble face
served to enforce her remarks; "I have disobeyed you
in going to see Zo&euml; contrary to your commands. I will
comply with your wishes in what does not compromise
my truth, my conscience, my honor, and my deepest
affections. The friendship of Zo&euml;, I learned all by
myself, when a little girl, was a sacred trust reposed in
me by my Heavenly Father. Therefore, I know you will
respect the convictions which impel me to more than ever
cherish and care for her. You will suffer your daughter
to judge and act in this matter, as her love and her sense
of right require her, will you not, mamma?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Strophel saw well how seriously Hilda viewed the
whole subject, and she dared not oppose her, therefore,
she gave an ungracious assent, requesting her not to be
seen more than was possible with Zo&euml; in the street, as she
felt very much mortified by her acquaintance with her.</p>

<p>When Zo&euml; recovered her consciousness, Hilda was sitting
by her side, watching every indication of returning
convalescence. She opened her eyes, fixed first a mournful,
troubled, inquiring gaze upon her face; gradually its
expression brightened as if a cloud were slowly rolling

<!--- vol 2 page 260 -->

away its dark folds, leaving a sunshiny smile to cheer and
rejoice those who lived, as it were, in its light. There
was joy in every beating of Hilda's pulse; there was a
sweet, subdued thankfulness in the heart of Sophia; and
Mr. Carlan, as he kissed the pale forehead of his risen
child, felt that he, too, had not in vain gone with her to the
gates of the dead, for he had brought from thence a contrite
spirit and an appreciation of something higher and better
than was recognized by him in his most prosperous days.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; gradually recovered, so as to take part again in the
duties of her home, and she sought, as much as possible,
to extend her sphere of usefulness abroad.</p>

<p>She gained by little and little the right idea of her constitution
in each of its departments, and its true relation to
God and humanity.</p>

<p>She thought of herself no longer as special and peculiar,
either in nature, character, or destination, but as one
of a grand company of souls, each invested with a more
than princely right, under God, to develop itself to the
point of Infinity. Only in the direction of evil and wrong
does the Almighty Republican Governor interpose his
beneficent influence to restrain and save his own from destruction
and injury; towards the ever multiplying spheres
of the All-Good and All-Perfect he has placed no barriers
to their progress, but on the contrary, has blazoned on high
every inducement through Nature, Christianity, and his
ever-watchful Providence for their advancement and complete
felicity.</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsey and his party returned from Barbadoes to
Santa Cruz, with the exception of Mr. Pierson, who decided
to go on with Mr. Stephenson to the Amazon, and from
thence to Chili, his place of destination.</p>

<p>Zo&euml; and Hilda greeted them with cordiality, and they
found comfortable lodgings in the hotel of Mrs. Howard.</p>

<p>Mr. Carlan found himself very much reduced in his
means, his losses by the hurricane being the last of repeated

<!--- vol 2 page 261 -->

blows, leveled against his fortune. He re-arranged
his affairs on a reduced scale, and his wife availed herself
of her talent in making nice confectionary and pastry to
increase their resources. Zo&euml;'s natural taste and idealism
came into play in this occupation, and she was a willing
and efficient aid to her mother in her work.</p>

<p>"See, mamma!" said she, as she pointed to a wedding-loaf
she had decorated to answer an order upon their
skill. "Is not that a work of art? If I make a beautiful
cake or tart, with a true aim after perfection in all its parts,
I shall feel as much satisfaction, so far as the effort goes,
as if I had painted a beautiful picture, and who knows, if I
begin and am faithful in this department, but that I may,
in future, rise so high as to work over the sky, and the
clouds, and the human form divine in a painting, as easily
as I now mould this sugar to my purposes. I think I'll
hang out my sign, '<i>Zo&euml; Carlan, Artist in Pies and Cakes;</i>'
and if people are bright enough to see a few years in
advance, they will read through these materialized syllables
the golden letters underneath of, '<i>Zo&euml; Carlan, Artist
in Composition Pictures and in Statuary</i>.' "</p>

<p>"What confectioner did you employ?" said Mrs. Rutgard
to Mrs. Stinson, on the occasion of her daughter
Ellen's marriage.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Carlan made all these knick-knacks; are they not
pretty? and this large loaf was ornamented by Zo&euml;. What
exquisite taste it evinces! By the way I heard you had
had trouble with your servants?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Rutgard, "they are as impertinent as
they can be. O this dreadful emancipation! We are all
ruined by it."</p>

<p>"Do you think so? My husband says his servants behave
remarkably well in the fields, and mine in the house
never did half so much work as they do now, or half as
well. They seem really to have risen in the scale of
humanity since the emancipation."</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 262 -->

<p>"Mr. Rutgard says that it is all a mere fancy of enthusiasts
to suppose that the African race is capable of improvement.
Why, look at Zo&euml; Carlan, educated as many
years as she has been, who has settled down into nothing
but a pastry cook!"</p>

<p>Yes, Zo&euml; was a pastry cook! for in this occupation did
she see her way of duty in the present. She would array
herself fitly for her employment and delight her mother
and find satisfaction for herself in expressing, in this humble
way her ideas of the beautiful and truly tasteful. From
her throne of labor, humble yet exalted as it was by her
high principles of action, she surveyed the myriads of her
sisters of every color and clime, who minister thus lowlily
to the comfort, health and happiness of mankind. She
thanked God that she could be thus brought into living sympathy
with them, and at the same time with Jesus, their
great workfellow and friend, whose words oftentimes
cheered her in the heat and labor of the day: "For
whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that
serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? But I am among
you as he that serveth."</p>

<p>How much nobler and truer, verily, is the rude life of
the kitchen if its walls and its most unseemly work are
hallowed by high endeavor, than the luxurious indolence
of the hysterical drone or of the butterfly-belle, floating
upon life's surface, on the fashionable promenade or in the
midnight assembly!</p>

<p>When the labors of the day were over she would either
stroll with her mother&mdash;and father sometimes now&mdash;amid
their favorite haunts, or sit under the shade of the tamarind
tree and weave into artistic form the shining seeds of the
mimosa, talking simply, yet ever beautifully upon the
themes which enriched and gladdened her life.</p>

<p>She was a pastry cook! but sometimes she would wander
alone till she reached her most beloved seat on a large
rock which had been washed up by the waves upon a point

<!--- vol 2 page 263 -->

extending far out from the main-land. Here she felt less
bounded than anywhere else by the inclosures of time
and sense, and her freed spirit would utter itself in jubilant
strains with the breaking surf for an accompaniment,
and the sea-birds' flight upwards to serve as the ethereal
spirit of music to waft her notes to the throne of the
Highest.</p>

<p>"O glorious and ever-shifting, yet always the same
ocean! venerable in thy hoary age, mighty in the propelling,
uplifting force of thy world-encircling waters! Thou
speakest to me of eternity in the past, and of a still more
glowing eternity in the future! Roll on in thy majesty like
the ages upon ages, ever bearing on thy varied front&mdash;now
darkened by storm and made terrible by thy roaring surge,
now reflecting the infinite and loving, universal smile of
God&mdash;the image of His great and marvelous dealings with
the nations.</p>

with thy Omnipotence; thou grantest us a foretaste, through
the soul's subtle sympathy, of thy Omnipresence; thou
spreadest before us the means of sharing with thee in thy
Omniscience; thou invitest us to be one with thee in thy
sublimely beneficent workings, while all time, eternity,
the creation without and the universe within us, cry out
to thee to unite us with humanity and Deity by the everlasting
bonds of thy love!</p>

the Father on high, first-born of a new spiritual creation!
Leader, Redeemer, Saviour, Elder Brother and Friend!
fain would I clasp hands with thee and labor to bring on
thy glorified reign. Intercede with our Father to aid me
in erecting thy kingdom below, to lead on the time when

<!--- vol 2 page 264 -->

peace shall reign over the lairs of the forest and the habitations
of men, and a little child shall lead on the hosts of
our God to power and renown through the might of all-conquering
love!</p>

<p>"Elder Scripture of Him, who spoke chaos into order
and harmony by the breath of his power! Nature, dear
mother, sweet mother, careful mother of eld, bloom brighter,
more beautiful, more fragrant than of yore, for God and
man will unite as never before to prune away thy excrescences,
to deck out thy loveliness, and call forth thy fruitful
stores to gladden the poor, and give more equally than
now to all the dwellers below.</p>

<p>"O wonderful Word! vouchsafed from on high! the clear
message of God granted to guide us through the wilderness
world! thou speakest to us now in thy every revealing,
in equal tones of command, of prediction, inspiration,
warning and tenderest love, even as thou didst to prophet,
historian, rapt-singer and seer, or to Mary sitting docile at
the feet of her Lord.</p>

<p>"O Life! thou art beautiful, befitting and grand. Through
harmonious correspondence with thy Author and his behests,
the hours glide away blissfully as eternity's flow.
Thou art a grand drama, in which, if we have conned well
our parts, every scene and each act chimes in without interruption
or jar with the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of the great theatre Manager,
showing a fit work of art. Thou art a triumphant
march, in which each one treads to music, who sees with
couched eye how to <i>keep step</i> with the Infinite, whose
everlasting arm we lean on. And an anthem art thou, in
which God calls upon solo, duet, quartette and orchestra to
sing in loving and spirited harmony to the never-ending
praise of his mercy and majesty.</p>

<p>"Death! what art thou but a radiant angel, standing midway
between heaven and earth to shadow its too brilliant
effulgence from mortals! Thou foldest the good to thy
loving embrace, and then turnest thy face to the sky, and

lo! the freed spirit returns thy embrace with thanks for
breaking the chain of its bondage.</p>

<p>"Immortality! the other side of life's page, on which
the faithful and pains-taking soul may be rid of the blots
and erasures of the first, and illumine it with the truth and
beauty of heaven. O! would that the sky-vail could be
folded aside, that I might greet and rejoice with the souls
of my own! for my frame is restless and worn with the
chafing and struggling of the spirit within it. It flutters
and pleads, and pants in its cage, saying, 'Release me; O
free me, that I may soar far away!'</p>

<p>ZO&Euml; suffered from having too little opportunity to employ
the energies of her mind, and allow her to precipitate,
so to say, the soarings of her imagination. She needed
some occupation commensurate with her intellect, and
equal to her capabilities of usefulness. She had persevered
in her attempts to bring herself into pleasant relations
with her people, and she devised many little ways of
raising their condition. But she worked in fetters, for the
Danish government kept a watchful eye upon its colonists,
to see that they did not overstep the lines marked out for
them, either in religion, education, politics, or in their
manufactures. She was like a highly-charged electric battery,
filling and ever filling with the subtle elements all
around her, with which she was in harmonious correspondence,
but having few points of sufficient power extending
towards her from any opposite pole, by which she might
discharge the superfluous ether, and thus relieve herself
of the nervous restlessness which pervaded her being.</p>

<p>She was one day expressing the wish to Hilda that she
could find more to do in accordance with the working of
the strongest part of her nature, and thus give expression
to her ideas of what life, individual character and society

<!--- vol 2 page 267 -->

ought to be, when her friend asked her why she did not
write a book.</p>

<p>"You know my attempt and failure in that line," said
she, "I have not sufficient command of detail or dramatic
power enough to make it striking and interesting."</p>

<p>"O try again!" said Hilda, " I know you will succeed,
You may have me for one of the characters and make me
just as foolish and ridiculous as you please. George will
like nothing better, than to have you show him up with all
his extravagances. Mr. Lindsey will make a beautiful
minister for your use. Dr. Chichester, as my hero once
said, will do for the background, to bring him out in better
relief, and for the <i>quality</i>, to quote my Cid again, you
could not desire more delightful specimens than Mr. Pierson
and his sisters. Begin with your school-life, and bring
in our dear Mrs. K&ouml;rner, the pastor and his wife, and can't
you weave Ben Ezra in, in some wizard-like way?" said
she, looking slily at Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, without changing countenance in
the least, as Hilda expected; "he will do for the spirit of
Judaism. I wonder how Mrs. Liebenhoff was going to
manage him in the plot of her story. I think, dear, I will
make a second attempt. Thank you for suggesting it."</p>

<p>She selected her subject; one connected with the fortunes
of her people, and her pen flew over the paper with
lightning speed, so that in a few weeks, she read her
manuscript to Hilda, whose enjoyment of its incidents
heightened her own satisfaction in this labor of love, and
healthy discharge of a part of her nature, mostly hidden
from the knowledge of the world.</p>

<p>Like plants, whose seeds have not germinated till near
the closing of summer, and which hasten to do their life-work
in a tithe of the usual time, lest the frosts should nip
them untimely, and thus prevent their leaving behind them
mementoes of their existence, so did she feel impelled by
a premonition of change in her destiny to shed the past

<!--- vol 2 page 268 -->

phases of her being by expression, that the future might
grow into more symmetry and beauty unencumbered by their
weight. She wrote from her own life, as much as her
shrinking nature would permit her to embody herself in
the form of Art, but far behind all its revelations, there
was the holy of holies, in which no one entered but the
Spirit of her God, in whose growing communion she had
more and more a foretaste of the heavenly world.</p>

<p>She received about this time, a letter from Mrs. Liebenhoff,
in which she told her of her own great loss, and
then went on as follows:</p>

<p>"Do you ask me, Zo&euml;, how I bear up under an affliction
so heavy, a loss so complete, of the object of my former
continued reference, solicitude and respectful regard?
You, at least, will understand me when I say, that though
sinking at times from the lack of the ever-sustaining arm,
watchful love and never-failing affectionate interest of my
beloved, yet, deep in my inmost soul is there at times, a
strange joy, never experienced in the happiest hours of
our marriage.</p>

<p>"For now I know that my glorified one, freed from the
mortality which fettered and chilled his intenser being, can
hold nearer and more loving communion with what most
incloses my life, even the soul, which burns and flames
upward, towards the spheres to which I know he has risen.
I lack not for sympathy and most friendly interest, and
oversight. As God gives to the trees, ere they cast their
leaves in the chill autumn, a promise of fresher life,
beauty and luxuriance after their winter repose, by drawing
to them, through their own attraction, the forces of
surrounding Nature, that plant on what seemed their
deadened branches, the living, beautiful buds of hope and
joy in the future, so my existence is enriched, as I once
never could have believed possible, by the tenderness and
affection of newly-found loved ones, added to the trusted
and tried. <i>He</i>, I well know, adds a new swell of joy to his

<!--- vol 2 page 269 -->

cherubic song when he sees that I, no more than he, fail
of the sympathy which, in my first hour of bereavement
seemed lost to me for ever, with the sudden quenching
of the light of his eye."</p>

<p>Then followed some local information, which she thought
would interest Zo&euml;, concerning Miss Ingemann, who preserved
intact, her systematic mode of training all minds
alike; of Miss Holberg, who had separated from her, and
taken the care of a few girls whom she was seeking to develop
in harmony with their own peculiar, natural characteristics;
of the American minister, who had been recalled,
and another sent in his place; of Mr. K&ouml;rner, who had
emigrated to America; and lastly, of Ben Ezra, who had
accompanied them to the same country. This had given
her Illustrator an opportunity to exhibit him in a new light in
one of the pictures in her book. He is holding a cross in
one hand, while a roll of parchment is lying at his feet.
An intelligent-looking eagle is standing by his side, to
whom he is saying, "Reverence no longer, the letter of
Scripture, but imbibe its life-giving spirit, and it will point
thee ever to the crucified Jesus, as the ideal of human
perfection, the inspirer and guide to a sublimely spiritual
life and its consequent bliss."</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsey came often to see Zo&euml;&mdash;so occasionally did
Emma and Meta Pierson. The former would bring and
read to her any tit-bit of literature she received from
America, and Meta would play upon her guitar and sing in
feeling strains, some of her favorite German airs. Zo&euml;
would join her voice to hers, and it seemed to them as they
listened to it like the tones of a spirit hovering near and
enticing them to heaven by the subtle melody of its strains.</p>

<p>One day, they came to her in grief and affliction. Their
brother, in whom their own being was wrapped, so strong
and tender was the affection between them, had suddenly
married a Spanish lady in Chili, after an acquaintance of
a few days. They were much distressed thereby, as it

<!--- vol 2 page 270 -->

must, of course, finally separate them from him, and they
feared that a foreign marriage would not be favorable for
his happiness, more than their own. The lady was intelligent,
of a freer soul than her education would indicate,
and a poetess.</p>

<p>"If she is all this, why be so troubled?" said Zo&euml;.</p>

<p>"I cannot relinquish him, who is a guardian, lover and
brother all in one, without a terrible pang. It seems to
me, that I wish no longer to live," said Emma.</p>

<p>"I can understand your feelings, dear Miss Pierson, for
I know from a life-long experience, the soreness of a soul
riven from its natural support. Still, such is the way of the
world in the course of God's Providence. Who knows, but
that a fresh shoot started in your new civilization may not
grow into a noble tree, sending forth luxuriant and fruitful
branches in the old worn-out one, for Chili is aged in its
Spanish life."</p>

<p>"But we have so few remaining friends, and Horace was
such a host in himself," said Meta.</p>

<p>"Why do you not engage in some work which will absorb
your powers, dear young ladies, and leave you less at
the mercy of the changing circumstances of your lot; you
have both of you such richly stored minds?"</p>

<p>"Meta does write occasionally," said Emma, "though
only to beguile her private hours."</p>

<p>"Why should she not be the Sappho of your country;
I see a world of idealism in the still life of her classic
features, which hide only to reveal all the more, the consuming
fire which they cover&mdash;an earnest of passionate,
burning song. Give it vent, and it shall at the same time,
delight her friends, and save the tenement which enthralls
it from ruin."</p>

<p>"I live in the past very much," said Meta. "I fear you
would not like my poems, your eye looks so much into
futurity."</p>

<p>"I love all times now," said Zo&euml;, "for perhaps you don't

<!--- vol 2 page 271 -->

know I dwell in eternity, as my friend Mrs. Liebenhoff
once told me she did. Do not look for poesy only in the
distance, or in the times long gone by. O! see it on every
hand, in the history of the past, in the living present, and
the advancing future! Every part of creation is instinct
with it, all times express to the awakened spirit its sentiment,
and all events, incidents and circumstances, assimilated
into our innermost, form themselves through the
subtle chemistry of the soul into rhythmical numbers, and
flow to the point of the pen in the still meditative hour."</p>

<p>"I am proud and grateful for my sister's genius, and look
forward to her taking no mean place among the writers of
our country."</p>

<p>"And you, Miss Emma, your quick observation, your
power of analysis of character, and the fire and force of
your nature point, as it seems to me, to your sphere. Put
them and your attainments into full requisition, and I
should like no better resource for my leisure hours than a
Tale from your stylus."</p>

<p>They bade her adieu, as they were to leave Santa Cruz
in a few days, and as they walked home with Mr. Lindsey,
Emma said to him: "Never again will I judge a human
being by the superficial standard of the world; for I now
see that one may pass by an angel of light, hidden from the
eyes of the vulgar by a dusky envelope, only to give out a
more loving lustre to the spirit prepared and waiting for
the blessing it can yield."</p>

<p>"Zo&euml; is passing away!" said Meta. "No power on earth
can retain her, for I read in her eye the beckoning light,
which the angels award to the sky-born. Before we reach
our home she will have risen to hers."</p>

<p>"It will be but a translation," said Mr. Lindsey, "when
she departs. It is not disease that is wasting her, but the
fluttering and beating of the imprisoned soul against the
frail walls which inclose it. Thank heaven there are
spheres, where conventionalism will not place its iron hoof

<!--- vol 2 page 272 -->

upon the natural action of giant, spiritual natures. In
heaven Zo&euml; will shine as a star of the first magnitude, not
to dazzle, but to lead to the upper mansions furnished for
emancipated souls."</p>

<p>Hilda came to Zo&euml; one morning in aglow of excitement.
"I have just received a letter from George Stephenson,"
said she, "which is so characteristic I must read you a
part of it, even if it is somewhat lover-like, at times, in its
expression. It is from Amazona.</p>

<p>" 'Here I am among the 'boys,' a pretty clever set of
fellows too, in this warm valley, into which God seems to
have poured the fattest and richest of all his most luscious
productions, with the giant river rolling its turbid length
within full sight of my hut. Didn't I think there was no
end to the long brook as we paddled down it in our canoe?
I can tell you, Hilda, the world is made on a pretty generous
scale, if we fellows would only get the cracks of our
skulls open wide enough to let the notion of it shine into
our muddy brains. The Southrons think that they are
going to get possession of this country and slide slavery
into it as slick as the water running over our great mill-dam
here. But they'll find that it takes two to make a bargain,
and that Young America, north of Mason and Dixon's
line, has a word or two to say before closing that contract.
No, sir-ee; niggers, as niggers, don't come into these diggins.
If they will emigrate here and set up a school for
manners of the real Christian style, and soften us rough
fellows down to a little more civilized stamp, and show us
how to be 'jolly under creditable circumstances,' as none but
a nig&mdash;I mean an Americo-African&mdash;can, and put some real
genuine humor into our Yankee sobersides, and share the
very best that's going with us, why, then we'll give them
a welcome. But we have had flying-horses long enough
to plow our fields with. Give us machinery in the future,
I say, that will go fast enough without having to lick it,

<!--- vol 2 page 273 -->

which spoils the temper on both sides of the hedge. Until
our steam engine and other tackling come from the States,
I am going to have a real live elephant to plow my fields
for me, and set the lions and tigers to plant the sweet
potatoes, and the monkeys, of which there are any quantity
here, will gather them into the cellar, provided they don't
eat them all up on the way. What funny critters they are,
Hilda, and no mistake&mdash;real caricatures of humanity. I
think I must have been one once myself, I enjoy their
tricks so much; and they seem to know it too, and wink at
me as much as to say, 'Giggle, if you will! When we
come to be men and women and set the reform-top spinning,
you will laugh t'other side of your mouth. For we
will have kingdom-come on the earth in a jiffy&mdash;not of the
kind that some people want, in which all the women are to
wear white aprons, and intone the litany with their heads
and hands hanging down like frost-bitten poppies, and the
men scraping up money like dirt in the streets to shut up
in their strong boxes, or to squander in some ruinous way
or other, but a good, healthy, happy, frolicsome one, where
everybody will do what he pleases, provided he does not
tread on other people's corns, or throw pepper or sleepy
dust in their eyes.' Hilda, I am getting to be such an anti-slavery
man that I expect my hair will begin to grow kinky,
as my sister's has ever since she became a freesoil woman,
and I am such a pious Christian that I have to hold myself
down by the force of one or two little bad habits, such as
smoking a cigar once in a week or so, or I should balloon
up to the third sphere before my time. However I <i>intend</i>
to leave off entirely before I see you again. It is all owing
to Mr. Lindsey, God bless him! He has saved me from
infidelity and showed me how I can be religious without
blotting out nature without, or nature within me. Now
don't think, my dear Hilda, that I am going to bring you
into this wild place to live, where you would be eaten up
by the sand-flies and musquitoes, to say nothing of the

<!--- vol 2 page 274 -->

other discomforts of a new settlement among half-savages.
No, no, I don't see my way clear to make a martyr of myself
or of you to that extent. I have made friends in Iowa,
and I am useful there, though I say it, that shouldn't say
it, perhaps, and there I'll build you the prettiest little
shanty there is between this and the full moon.</p>

<p>" 'I don't know what I've done to deserve such good fortune
as to have one of the angels of heaven condescend to
pity me in my wild condition, but this I know, that if thinking
of, and wishing for you ever since I was sixteen years
old has given me any title to your love, why then it is bestowed
upon the right one. I feel as if I could do anything
in creation in the finishing-off line, which Mr. Lindsey
says we were put here for, with you to encourage and back
me; and if I don't have a real Christian community in our
place in less than ten years, where every one shall do about
right, then I'm mistaken in myself.</p>

<p>" 'I have written to my father and sister that I have found
again the most precious diamond ever crystallized this
side of the central fires, and I guess I shall have a little
different reception when I return home this time, from
what I did when I came back from the Rocky mountains.
I never told you that story.</p>

<p>" 'Well, here it is:</p>

<p>" 'After I had been home from college some weeks, I got
tired of hanging round my sister's rocking-chair, and holding
her yarn while she wound it, (blessed little soul as she
is! every grain of her is pure honey). I thought I would
join a company and just step off to the tall hills I had
read about so much. I said nothing about it to the gov&mdash;&mdash;,
I mean my father, because you see, I was determined to
go, and did not want to give him the trouble of refusing
me for nothing. I was away two years. Had a pretty hard
row to hoe, I can tell you, and was glad enough to get home
with my rebellious top-piece safe in its place. I arrived in
the evening. Sister and aunty were almost crazy with joy,

<!--- vol 2 page 275 -->

but felt anxious about my reception from my father. I
don't know in what way they managed to let him know I
was in the house, (leave women for such delicate business
as that!) but the next morning I went down to breakfast,
and he looked up from his coffee and beef-steak as calm as
a clock, and said, 'Good morning, George!' just as if I
had not been away a single day. That was his way of rebuking
me. Didn't I feel cheap? I should rather he
would have given me a scolding or a round box on the ear
by a long chalk. But I never ran away again, that is
certain.</p>

<p>" 'I am collecting all the pretty things I can for you; but
it is strange, since I met you, how my ideas have grown
about what is good enough for a present to a lady. Don't
despair of me, Hilda, and I will try and make something
worthy of you yet out of myself. I only need you to lead
me on and point the way to the higher regions, and if I
don't make you happy in this world and the next too&mdash;if
you don't get tired of me&mdash;it will be because the order of
things is reversed in the universe, and effects no longer follow
causes. Take good care of yourself, dearest Hilda,
for you must remember you have charge of two lives instead
of one, for the future; and if yours goes by the
board, the other certainly will.</p>

<p>" 'Give my love to Zo&euml;, and tell her I am collecting all
the poetry and romance I can for her, in the shape of stories
and incidents, and traits of character.</p>

<p>" 'I have got one beautiful one about a bird called '<i>La
Alma Perdid&agrave;,</i>' the lost soul, which I shall repeat to her
when I come to Santa Cruz.</p>

<p>" 'Your ever devoted lover, G. S.' "</p>

<p>"Mr. Stephenson has a noble, generous soul," said Zo&euml;.
"He will do all in his power to make you happy, I am sure."</p>

<p>"I will read you one paragraph more which I hesitated
to at first, but I wish you to see what a vein of tender

<!--- vol 2 page 276 -->

sentiment there is underlying his free, imaginative intellect
and strong, impulsive character.</p>

<p>" 'Do not fear, my own Hilda, that you will find no tenderness
under the rough buffalo hide, within which I have
wrapped all my gentler emotions. A man who had such
a mother as mine to watch over him all his boyhood, to
share with him his sports, his little troubles, his studies,
and his work, and teach him about God and all holy
things, though he may get crusted over somewhat by the
wicked world, and slide into some of its evil ways, will
not need much urging to return to the right path by the
woman he loves. My mother used to be anxious lest I was
growing up irreligious and careless of all high subjects of
reflection; and, somehow, I shrunk from letting her know
how much I did think of them (I am sorry for it now as it
would have pleased her,) but a fellow can't be out night
after night as I have been under the stars without feeling
himself in God's presence, and thinking that he had better
take some heed to his ways, so as to have his character
come within speaking-trumpet distance of his ideas of
right. If she knows now of my love for you, it makes her
happier in heaven. She will know that through you she
will, some time or other, meet me again. So, though I
have led a rough life, having slept upon the prairie, eaten
bison meat, and drank out of the Mississippi, my heart tells
me that there is a nice, warm, downy place in its depths
where yours can nestle and find happiness, and repose in
its most loving and sacred hours.'</p>

<p>"O Zo&euml;," said Hilda, as she finished, "I feel very rich
in the possession of so noble a heart, and I hope I have
some proper sense of the responsibility with which I consider
womanhood is invested by our heavenly Father, to be
the leader of the beloved of the other sex in the moral
and spiritual departments of life. If you would accompany
us to America, dearest, my happiness would then be
complete. I shall go with him on his return."</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 277 -->

<p>"I can never leave my father and mother while I live;
and Hilda, my soul warns me that my life is not to be long.
Nay, weep not, I am but just beginning to be free from the
feeling of orphanage and forlornness, for, by the inner light,
I see the home of my life's yearnings, and him whom it has
been the passion of my whole life to reveal in his glory.
Will you take my manuscript to the United States and publish
it for the benefit of my down-trodden people? I know,
Hilda, that you will always be a friend to them."</p>

<p>Hilda could only enfold her in her arms and weep and
sigh out her love for her, and the promise of devotion to
the cause of Christian freedom and holiness which Zo&euml;
had lived, moved, and had her being in ever since she was
a conscious existence.</p>

<p>After sitting silent a few moments, she took from her
pocket a poem which her sister, Mrs. Warrington, had
handed her, written by a friend of her own, a former resident
of the island, just before leaving for England. She
had brought it that Zo&euml; might share with her its sweet,
affectionate sentiment and rhythm.</p>

<p>LIEUTENANT ARNSEN, the chief of the
Danish forces in Fredericstadt, with a view to the entertainment
of the men of his troop, got up little festivals from
time to time, to which he invited the neighboring gentry.
On one of these occasions, he came to Mrs. Carlan, to
order some confectionary for it, and invited her and her
husband and Zo&euml; to be present. As a Dane, he was comparatively
free from the English prejudice against their
caste and color.</p>

<p>There was to be a comedy in the early part of the evening,
then a <i>hop</i> by the Danish soldiers and the young
colored girls from the neighboring families, and afterwards,
Lieutenant Arnsen's friends were to adjourn to his room
for music and dancing, and refreshments among themselves.</p>

<p>They accordingly went. Zo&euml; and her mother chose a
seat in the back part of the room, resisting the friendly
Lieutenant's entreaties to place themselves nearer the
stage.</p>

<p>The petty drama enacted was one chosen with reference
to the quarrel between Denmark and Schleswig Holstein.
As all present were good Danes, of course it was so arranged
that Denmark should have all the glory in each
scene, and the unfortunate duchy all the disgrace and

<!--- vol 2 page 281 -->

defeat. It went off very well, and caused much amusement;
and the Lieutenant was thanked for his effort to throw a
little additional life over the social circles of the island.</p>

<p>Hilda was seated in front of the curtain with a gay group
of her Santa Cruz and American acquaintances. Zo&euml; saw
her eye turning inquiringly from one side to the other, and
she supposed she might be looking for herself. The invitation
was given to attend the f&ecirc;te after Hilda's usual morning
call upon her, so that they had no communication upon
the subject. At length, in a pause between the acts, Hilda,
with her usual independence of action, when impelled by
a strong feeling, stood up and turned completely around
and gazed over the assembly. She had the earnest look of
one seeking after some particular object, which redeemed
it from the appearance of staring at the company. She
caught a glimpse of Zo&euml;'s family party, and, quick as
thought, she left the Count and Countess of Aliford, by
whose side she was sitting, with an apology at her abrupt
leave-taking, and made her way unattended, so sudden was
her exit, and came and seated herself by Zo&euml; and her
group of colored friends. There were sly looks and winks
among the members of the first circle, and her mother
was intensely mortified. After returning home, she scolded
her severely, in her first outburst of anger. Hilda bore the
torrent of abuse unflinchingly, saying, "Mamma, in this
one matter of my affection for my dearest friend, I must
act according as my love and my duty impel me. Zo&euml; and
I are one and inseparable, not only in our private hours,
but whenever she honors any public gathering by her presence.
Let the superficial world despise her if it will.
Her spirit dwells where neither the breath of popular favor
nor the hiss of its scorn can affect her; and, thanks be to
God, who has been so gracious to me as to permit my more
terrestrial temper to rise so far heaven-ward as to be a support
and a source of enjoyment to her. I go with Zo&euml;!"</p>

<p>The arrangements for the f&ecirc;te were very pretty and

<!--- vol 2 page 282 -->

tasteful. The grounds surrounding the barracks were lighted
by lamps, inclosed within colored paper, giving a pretty
effect to the scene; and the entrance was through a gateway
arched with wreaths of flowers twined round a device
expressive of loyalty to the Danish government and crown.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carlan and Zo&euml; declined the invitation of Lieutenant
Arnsen to adjourn to his own apartments to partake
of the after amusements, and then of the refreshments.</p>

<p>An instinctive delicacy and true self-respect guarded
them from forcing themselves upon those with whom they
could have so little affinity, as with the self-exalting, social
circles of a people who still hankered after the feudal
usages and barbarous customs which the system of slavery
entails upon its adherents.</p>

<p>The next Sunday, the communion service was observed,
and Sophia and Zo&euml; welcomed the opportunity of clasping
hands, as it were, with the Christ through the symbols of
his love and self-sacrifice, and renewing, through this simple
rite, their devotion to his great and ever-expanding
mission on the earth.</p>

<p>To be entirely relieved from any possible cause of offense
to others, and thus have their minds in harmony with
the occasion, they waited until a few of the last communicants,
some old, infirm negro women, who subsisted by
charity, went up to the altar. As Zo&euml; knelt by the side of
her mother to receive of the elements, she felt a soft hand
laid on her own, as it rested upon the chancel, and she
knew it was none other than Hilda's. She had purposely
waited, that they might together pledge their Master in his
death-cup, which both of them had pierced so far to the
centre of spiritual life, as to discern it was the true life-elixir,
in its power of perpetual rejuvenation, while the
bread was the long sought for, yet never found by the world,
philosopher's stone, which gives to the partaker, when received
in the spirit of our Lord's bequest, the command

<!--- vol 2 page 283 -->

of the wealth, not only of the earth, but also of the heavens
everlastingly.</p>

<p>There were whisperings and exclamations among the
inmates of Mrs. Howard's boarding-house, one morning,
which Emma and Meta Pierson could not comprehend,
until Mr. Marland came in to make his usual evening call,
and said, that he was going to attend a wedding at Mrs. Graenske's,
the next morning at six o'clock.</p>

<p>"A wedding! and whose, pray?" said Jane Rutgard,
who had just come in from her brother's plantation in the
country.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Tileston's."</p>

<p>"To whom?"</p>

<p>"To Mrs. Graenske's youngest daughter."</p>

<p>There was great wonder, then whispers again, and angry
exclamations on Jane's part, as if the reputation of Fredericstadt
society, of which she was a decided unit, to say
the least, had suffered a stain. Then there were half explanations
about bayonets and pistols being put in requisition
by the young lady's brother, if the marriage was not
consummated, etc., etc. But this fact was fully established
in Mr. Marland's mind, that the ceremony was to be performed
by him at the aforesaid unseasonable hour, as the
pair were to leave for St. Thomas on the boat.</p>

<p>He then entered into conversation with Miss Pierson, in
which he enlarged upon the excellencies of the rubric, the
truths of Episcopalianism, the glory of, and venerableness
of the <i>Church</i>, and grew so eloquent, in his own estimation,
as to justify him in staying until quite an unseasonable
hour. Meta Pierson retired to her room&mdash;one by one, the
other ladies and gentlemen left, and still the fruitful theme
was not exhausted. Miss Pierson was a heretic, and must
be made to see the error of her ways.</p>

<p>She tried the effect of silence, then grew less careful in
the concealment of her yawns, until he slowly roused

<!--- vol 2 page 284 -->

to the idea of his untimeliness of stay. He got as far as
the door, hung upon the latch, still unwearied in his
attempts at her conversion, when, not being able to bear it
longer, she arose and took the candle, saying, "Good
evening, Mr. Marland. You must excuse me if, at this
late hour, I am not able to see the force of your argument.
But really, in my present somnolent condition, I am not
responsible for any amount of dullness of comprehension
of the claims of your <i>sect</i> to plume itself upon exemption
from mistakes in its creeds; much less do I see the justice
of its assuming to be the 'immaculate conception' of the
Apostles of the Christian time. I may be singular in my
taste, but if I am to lean on any uninspired authority,
which your Church, as well as all the others, has proved
itself very plainly to be, I shall go back a step or two
farther and rest in the bosom of that of the Catholics.
You will excuse me if I speak very plainly, but I must
say that, if I ever leave that of my own simple faith, which
God forbid that I ever should, for any less advanced one,
I shall worship with them; for, if I am to be in bondage,
it shall be to one tyrant, not to ten thousand. If dogmatism
and condemnation are hurled at me in the cathedrals,
I can at least resort to the symbols, the pictures, and statuary
for diversion and relief. It would be well if we, to a
certain extent, as those religionists do, aided ourselves in
accordance with common sense and reason, by the use of
these means. Instead of having nothing but bare walls to
stare upon, or to echo back the mistaken and presumptuous
insults of fallible men to my injured and indignant soul,
when assailed, I have found them an acceptable resource.
Good evening, Mr. Marland!"</p>

<p>He went out with the full determination to write a sermon
for the next Sunday, expressly for Mr. Lindsey and
the young ladies. He thought it over, determined where
to put the flourishes of oratory, and where a half-whispered
and half-hissing annunciation of their horrible future doom,

<!--- vol 2 page 285 -->

which must certainly finish any disposition for free thought
henceforth. He became so much interested in this mental
occupation that he laid awake until a very late hour. His
imagination branched off from the prospective delivery of
the sermon to its being published, and to its attracting the
attention of the bishop, who would, perhaps, grant him a
good rectorship, in consequence, in the great metropolis of
his country. And then how reverently he would fold his
canonicals about him in the vestry! and how spotless
should be his surplice, and neckerchief, and bands! With
what devotion he would cover his face with his lawn before
the great congregation, when he entered the desk, hem-stitched
as it was by some fair member of <i>the Church!</i>
and with what propriety he would read the service, and
through what eloquence he would save dying souls! How
the hooped moire-antique skirts and fur cloaks, with the
elegant matrons within them, would pet, and patronize,
and court him to their sumptuous abodes! Especially how
would the French hats, with young ladies in front of them,
and the rich, trailing, silk robes inclosing&mdash;what should
be, if they are not&mdash;souls full of immortal hopes, admire
and look up to him!&mdash;And yet, for all this, Mr. Marland
meant to be a pretty good and conscientious man. But the
angels of Faith, Hope, and Charity, as viewed in the comprehensive
Christian sense were, in him, but of a diminutive
and feeble type. They were ever liable to be
smothered in his surplice, or scorched in the Puseyite
candles, or trodden upon when he turned his back to the
people as High Church demanded, or crushed between
the purple velvet covers of the prayer-book, or precipitated
in the repeated reading of the creeds. He was in continual
peril lest, instead of "Holiness to the Lord" being
inscribed upon every part of his ministerial m&eacute;nage, even
to "the bells of his horses." there should be written all
over himself and them in delicate letter-press, with frequent

<!--- vol 2 page 286 -->

Italics to give emphasis to the announcement&mdash;The
Right 'Reverend Cream Cheese,' Lord Bishop of &mdash;&mdash;,
W. X. Y. Z.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that, kept awake as he was, by these
<i>uplifting</i> meditations, he should oversleep himself in the
morning. It was within a few minutes of the time set for
the wedding when he awoke. He jumped up, threw on
his clothes without having time for his ablutions, and with
unkempt hair, with no perceptible white collar about his
neck, and with the knot of his kerchief awry, he dashed
along the street and entered Mrs. Graenske's abode just
as they were dispatching a servant to hasten him. The
company were all assembled, the ceremony must take
place without delay, else the Lieutenant would lose his
passage in the boat and outstay his furlough. So Mr.
Marland tried to collect his scared and scattered wits to
read the marriage form. In his flutter he called the bride,
husband, and the groom, wife, which created a giggle among
a group of nephews and nieces, and brought down upon
them grave shakes of the head and wide open eyes at their
naughtiness. But when at the conclusion he pronounced
them, in his excitement, "a match," they laughed outright,
and were taken out of the room at once by the head and
shoulders, not to appear again until they had given such
vent to their mirth as to make them safe inmates in the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>A hasty glass of wine was drank to the health of the
bride, with rueful looks on the part of her relatives, while
the groom was treated with sufficiently stiff politeness to
announce to him that he was accepted as a necessity more
than as a son or brother.</p>

<p>Then commenced the procession seaward, The <i>family
ark</i> received the "twin souls," and drove lumbering away,
while negroes, little and big, followed after, running with
boxes, bags, umbrellas, baskets, causing a general excitement

<!--- vol 2 page 287 -->

through the town, for the people were, at this hour,
chiefly on the market square, or going to or from it.</p>

<p>They arrived at the shore just as the "Blue Peter," the
small signal sail, was taken down. The bride was safely
put aboard; but the Lieutenant, who chose to be married
in his scarlet regimentals, with his sword on, in going hurriedly
up the steps to the vessel, got that appendage entangled
in some way between his feet, causing him to fall
into the water. He sank so as to cover even the very tip
of his plume, but was dragged out by two stalwart negroes,
who grinned from ear to ear at his sorry, draggled appearance;
for the blacks had no very good-will towards the
Danish officers. He retired to put on his citizen's dress,
somewhat crest-fallen. Every time he appeared during
the voyage, they would laugh, and it did not increase his
equanimity to hear them say, "He 'gin to shake his plume
again. Next thing him crow and tip backwards. Him
sharp, iron tail feathers very much in way. Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>And this was the unpoetical conclusion to the marriage
of our philosopher, whose system of morals was quite too
extensive and sublime to be bounded by Christianity. His
self-selected, psychological twin had the humiliation of
feeling that she was now forced on him, as his companion
for life, by his fear of being shot down by her incensed
relatives. And the exalted idea of the true union with
which he had deluded her, threatened to end in the separation
of their spirits, which a want of due self-restraint
and disobedience to the highest laws laid down by nature
and God will inevitably cause.</p>

<p>His unseasonable matinal marriage was the seal to the
unbecoming character of the whole affair. Formerly the
devices for such events were, Cupid playing with a nymph;
Cupid catching a butterfly; Cupid with a torch, etc., etc.
In these prosaic days, when symbols and emblems seem to
have lost their force and beauty, it should be Cupid on a

<!--- vol 2 page 288 -->

steam engine with eyes starting with fright at a threatened
explosion; Cupid on a lump of ice in the middle of the
river, shivering from cold; Cupid in a cave, with a tallow
candle in his hand, peering around at the darkness made
visible; or Cupid in the kitchen among the pots and kettles
all begrimed and begreased thereby.</p>

<p>MR. LINDSEY and his young friends were about
to leave Santa Cruz. They had been received and treated
very hospitably and kindly, both by their hostess and the
neighboring gentry, and had treasured up a store of pleasant
memories for the future, both of its perennial verdure,
and its social and agreeable inhabitants.</p>

<p>To Mr. Lindsey, it was a season of unmingled enjoyment,
with the exception of his wife's absence from him. He
improved this season of leisure in collecting information
with regard to the history of the island, its system of servitude,
of the late emancipation, and its probable prospects
in the future. He was a student in the natural sciences,
and his eye was open and quick to perceive all that was rare,
curious and beautiful in this tropical climate, and to read
a fresh page of God's love and wisdom in the new phases
of Nature presented to him.</p>

<p>The evening before he set sail for St. Thomas, he called
on Zo&euml;. She was sitting alone, (her mother having gone
out to see a sick person near,) reading Dr. Channing's

<!--- vol 2 page 290 -->

sermon on the future life. She spoke of the pleasure and
profit she had derived from his works, and then went on to
say:</p>

<p>"I think we dwell too much on the distinction between
this life and another. To me, existence is a grand totality,
a sphere without circumference, a universe without
limitation. I know that this frail tenement which incloses
my spirit, must drop from me, for neither my friends nor I
have known how to keep it in exact accordance with my
spiritual nature. But who knows, Mr. Lindsey, in the future,
when through a more complete knowledge of the
laws of a healthy life, by means of science and art, when
the world shall become so subdued to order, as to be a
more fitting abode than now, for God's most precious creation,
human nature, but that there may not be this apparent
decided break in our being? May it not come to pass that
the ever-growing, ever-refining soul may gradually and
easily form to itself its fitting abode, and death be indeed,
but a deep sleep for an hour, to revive itself, that it may
awaken again, replumed and brightened for fresh communion
with those with whom it lives in affinity below. We
speak of the lower and the higher world, of heaven and
earth, but this is simply to accommodate our feeble conception
of spiritual things to ourselves and our friends.
Heaven and hell are in the soul. The spiritual world is
all about us. We are a part of it ourselves; we see and
commune with what we are capable of appropriating.
And we shall all through eternity see world within world
rising to infinity, according as we are elevated to the capacity
of perceiving these successive spheres."</p>

<p>"It is a delightful train of thought to indulge in, and it
may be so," said he. "But the world will not be satisfied
with it, for the majority of our race are so discontented
here, and see so little beauty or poetry about them, that
they look for something entirely different outwardly, in the
future life. And yet, did they but consider a moment,

<!--- vol 2 page 291 -->

they might see that those of different mental and spiritual
characteristics here, are just as ignorant of each other as
if in different worlds. Yes, it must be, that the soul
makes its own sphere here and hereafter, and it may be,
that it will become so superior to the elements of nature,
that they shall never have the power to strike it down, but
ever be the aids to carry it on to a more glorious destiny
without any rude rupture or decay."</p>

<p>"I think so," said Zo&euml;; "I have great faith in the instincts
of large classes of humanity, or of those of a few
individuals even, who live to express and make them
practical in separate ages, though in somewhat different
forms.</p>

<p>"The occasional eager search after the life-elixir points
to something, we may be sure. It is a prophecy, that we
shall find it some day. In my opinion, it is the electric
fluid which pervades all space, and which the true, harmonious
and spiritual human being is pervaded with, and
which gives him ever-growing life and power. If it can
have legitimate action and be regulated by other sympathetic
beings, it will perpetually renew the corporeal part.
But&mdash;" and she paused and silently pressed her hand
upon her heart, while her voice lowered&mdash;"it may be so
restrained by the confinement of an uncongenial sphere, as
to burst the frail tenement which incloses it by the very
force of its desire for expansion and response."</p>

<p>"I have a letter from Mrs. Lindsey here of which I will
read you a part in which she has inclosed some lines,
which show the deep yearning and sympathy there is in
the feminine heart of America for the oppressed of your
people. I have copied them to leave with you, if you
would like them.</p>

<p>"My wife writes as follows:</p>

<p>" 'There is nothing particularly new in the affairs of the
country. There is the perpetual play, as is usual, of wheel
within wheel, without the apparent possibility, on the part

<!--- vol 2 page 292 -->

of the men of the nation to rise to an elevated stand-point
from which society can be viewed in all its relations, and a
new, and higher, and more thrilling key-note be struck,
from which shall burst out the battle-song against evil
and corruption, and lead on the anthem commemorating
our country's true greatness. This it is left for us women
to do. You smile when I talk thus, and go on reasoning
the next moment with your gentlemen friends upon the
effect of this or that movement put in force by your sex.
But for the next century, at least, and I know not if longer,
man will, through the Providence of God, look to woman's
spiritual insight to hint to him of God's will and design for
the good of the world. There will be no rude change of
the spheres of the sexes. Woman will remain as the best
instincts, and reason, and affections of true men all point
to her being, not his drudge, his toy, or unequal companion,
but the carefully cherished wife of his bosom, the
mother of his children, the tender sympathetic friend,
lover, consoler, and aid, and the sunny, beneficent, ministering
spirit of his home. Besides all this, she is to be
the priestess of the inner, sacred temple left in charge of
humanity by the Most High. She is to utter the oracle
which is to direct men to purge, and purify, and exalt
the counsels of the people, and, if need be, at first, until
he moves with quicker step than has been his wont, to
lead on the peaceful armies to their bloodless and glorious
victories over the forces of sin, and establish the spiritual
reign of Christ on the earth.</p>

<p>" 'Art will, through her consecrated genius, become
what it is not at present, worthy of Christendom in the
nineteenth century. Literature will rise to be the fitting
handmaid of religion. Science will not only open resources
for material wealth, but will bind the two former
by indissoluble chains to the Author of the universe.
And Christ, through the faith, character, and spirit which
he bequeathed to the world, interpreted by all the light

<!--- vol 2 page 293 -->

which can be thrown around them by the advancing spiritual
might of this era, will be, without question, the
Leader, Exemplar, and Saviour of the world.</p>

<p>" 'Since your departure I have made the acquaintance
of a young man, a Hungarian Jew, who brought a letter
of introduction to you from your friend Mr. Fielding.</p>

<p>" 'He is a person of education and a gentleman, devoted
to the cause of Christianity interpreted in a very liberal
sense, and to the good of humanity in every form. It is
refreshing, in these times of dainty ease and self aggrandizement,
and lowered tone of public spirit and sentiment,
to find one who lives, through the force of a perpetual
spring of enthusiasm, for high ideas and principles. In an
age too, when the intellectual and practical engross so
large a part of the best men and women of our country, it
enlarges one's sphere of sympathy and ideas of the companionship
possible in society between those of like interests
and aims, to find in him the <i>Soul</i> with its fire, poetry,
insight, magnetic force, and attraction, occupying pretty
nearly its legitimate proportion and sphere.</p>

<p>" 'Not that his nature has as yet reached its equilibrium
upon the thousand and one points of investigation and discussion
in this thinking, curious, restless era. Women are
to ascend first to the pedestal which is sustained by the
Infinite alone, through a docile and joyful obedience to
his various laws; but he approaches nearer to that position
than most men. When he learns to trust more implicitly,
than he now does, to the simple Christian precepts and
less to the ancient philoso-<i>phers</i> and modern philoso-<i>phies</i>,
he will work himself clear, and make his mark upon the
world.'</p>

<p>"This letter," said Mr. Lindsey, "is written in the form
of a Journal, and comprises the experience of several
weeks. She goes on farther to say of him:</p>

<p>"' He is a singular being from this fact, that the soul in
him bears such sway as to modify very perceptibly his

<!--- vol 2 page 294 -->

external appearance from time to time. I have an opportunity
to observe him narrowly, as I read German with him
daily, in accordance with your parting wish that I should
learn it.</p>

<p>" 'Sometimes I can think of nothing but of all the patriarchs
impersonated in him, so venerable is his whole personnel
and manner. The next day he comes like the young
warrior he was in the revolution of his country, and instead
of expecting him to sit down quietly and hear my lesson, I
am on the qui vive for the cry of 'To horse! bring my
horse! Let us speed over the mountains! We will
cut down the Russians and scatter the Austrians! See us
sweep down the barriers to the freedom of the Magyars!
Kossuth! come, Kossuth! Quick, quick, lead on our
warriors!'</p>

<p>" 'Another day he comes in, the keen, acute, critical Rabbi,
splitting hairs, dividing sharp-edged razor lines, and trying
to look with his wizard-like eyes into the very depths
of one's being.</p>

<p>" 'Still again, he is a tender, sympathizing friend in
affliction and trouble, as I have occasion to know through
some of my neighbors.</p>

<p>" 'Again, he is the poet, full of fire and fancy, reading
the hidden meanings of flowers, and trees, and symbols
of every kind, as none but an Oriental can, and scarcely
able to repress the deep, and bitter, and ever-present sense
of his loneliness and exile.</p>

<p>" 'Again, he is the reformer, reaching forth with every
point of his fingers, no less than his subtle, wakeful intellect
after new truths and intimations to aid him in his constant
aspiring after excellence and advancement.</p>

<p>" 'He speaks of the past as having been the grave of
many hopes and yearnings after happiness and peace, and
occasionally expresses the desire and trust, that he shall
yet find in affection and family ties a home in the future.</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 295 -->

<p>" 'But after one of these seasons of mysterious reference
to his destiny, he will bury himself in his studies,
and one would think then to hear him converse or witness
his absorption in learning&mdash;that Plato was to be the rule of
the mind of the present&mdash;that Socrates was again to propose
his ceaseless questions (Heaven save us women from
touching even the hem of his robe!), or that the German
philosophers were the Messiahs of the ages.</p>

<p>" 'And lastly, he evidently imagines himself, in his most
excited moments, a Fate destined to cut the thread of the
worn-out times that still linger, and to bury them out of our
sight, and spin anew the warp and woof which will weave
a more enduring and beautiful web. He says that in
Europe, he fixed his eye on the map of the United States,
and singled out the Queen City as the scene of his mission;
and he speaks in tones of authority and decision of
his plans for its improvement. And yet, so different is
man from woman, that when an inspiration is given to him for
his life-work, and an intimation of the theatre of its accomplishment,
what does he do but already begin to speak of
going hence!</p>

<p>" 'Strange being is this descendant of the chosen people
of God! Last week I read an extract of your letter to him,
in which you spoke of the young Quadroon, Zo&euml; Carlan&mdash;of
her pure character and tender, imaginative soul, and he
started up as if new life were infused through his being.
He rushed out as soon as he could do so with propriety&mdash;leaving
me amazed at the effect of a few detached sentences
relating to her. I was wondering what connection
there was between your innocent epistle and my Janus-faced
German teacher, when in turning my eye over the
text-book he has brought me to-day for my use, I found on
a blank leaf written over and over again&mdash;Zo&euml;, Zo&euml;, Zo&euml;,
with Ben Ezra, Ben Ezra, in close connection. I now remember
his once saying that he had come last from Copenhagen,

<!--- vol 2 page 296 -->

and I conclude that she might have been a pupil of
his in Miss Ingemann's school, and that there is an attachment,
on his part, towards her. Since that he has been in
high spirits. The warrior part of his nature is decidedly
in the ascendant.</p>

<p>" 'Another phase has come over my Hebrew of Hebrews.
Like Job he sits in sackcloth and ashes, no less dismal to
him and dreary to others that they are not external but
cover over his <i>spirit</i> with darkness and dust.</p>

<p>" 'Still another manifestation! This Israelite, whom I had
thought without guile, came into our midst in the dimness
of the last evening, his gloom having given way to cynicism
and ire. Wrath sat upon his furrowed brow, scorn curled
his lip and beard, and every word was a hiss and a sting.
In my innocence I spoke to him of what occurred to me of
the trifling incidents of the day, and you would have
thought I had been Atropos, destined to cut the different
threads of which his destiny is spun, and that he hoped to
brow-beat me from the behests of the great arbiter who
directs the Three Sisters, so fiercely did he receive and answer
my unconscious and child-like remarks. I remembered
the story of the 'Wandering Jew,' who scoffed at our sublime,
solitary and suffering Lord, and I then knew that this
man was no other than he, and that the loneliness of his lot,
the bitterness of his doom, was at times beyond his power
of patient endurance. I pondered upon the strange and
awful existence of this wonderful being, and said to myself,
how long will men cling to the worn-out creeds and parchments
of the past, and not see that in the religion of Jesus
is the cure of all life's ills, the sure hope of its perennial
vigor and youth! For if he would but receive this later
gift of God in its purity and extent, then would he be
relieved from his imaginary curse and be at rest from his
wanderings.</p>

<p>" 'This morning I received this parting note from Ben
Ezra:</p>

<p>" 'I go to the sunny south, and Hope whispers to me that
when I kiss the shores of the isle of the Holy Cross I shall
find the rest which, through ages, I have sought for in
vain, and the bliss which flows from both forgiveness and
love.' "</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsey looked up as he finished, and something in
Zo&euml;'s face indicated to him not to remark upon the contents
of Mrs. Lindsey's letter. He relieved her from a
perceptible embarrassment by saying:</p>

<p>"By the way, Mrs. Lindsey says that Mrs. Pumpkin told
her when she last saw her, that, as she was so exorbitant
in her wishes for a large edition of her work, that her publisher
advised that it should first appear in a paper, which
my wife and I are going to establish on my return, entitled
the 'Independent Highway.' A chapter inserted weekly
will answer very well to show the 'signs of the times;' so I
shall accede to her proposal to introduce them."</p>

<p>"They are a neglected race, who seem to have

<p>MR. LINDSEY arose to
take his departure, and as he held
Zo&euml;'s hand within his own in his
final farewell, she said to him, "I
thank you, sir, for the aid which
your clear intellect, high adherence
to truth and duty, and your ever cheerful tone of mind
have afforded me. In you I have seen the combination of

<!--- vol 2 page 299 -->

the broad, free views of life and society, a highly cultivated
mind, a ready attention to the smaller no less than the
larger obligations of our lot, high devotional sentiment and
gentle affections, with the consecration of every part of
your nature to the claims of the Christian religion. You
have done me great good, and I shall always remember you
with gratitude and love." So they parted&mdash;he and his
friends turned their faces towards the invigorating breezes
of the north&mdash;she cast her ever-clearer and more penetrating
glance upward, where a more than tropical sun enlightened
her by His beams and kindled to an ever intenser flame
the spirit within her.</p>

<p>She reverted to the manuscript which Mr. Lindsey had
left for her, and read as follows:</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">COLLOQUY BETWEEN THE AFRICANS AND THE DEEP FEMININE
SOUL.</p>

</div>

<p>"O miserable me! The white man tore me from my
sunny home, where the leaves are ever green and shining,
and the flowers and birds and shells are brightly tinted, to
shiver in the cold north wind, which pales both man and
them, and the poor Buckra freezes, and his soul grows
stiff within him."</p>

<p>"Poor, poor chilled Buckra," echo answers, very low
and far away.</p>

<p>"My mother wrings her hands and weeps for me beside
the cottage door. My little sisters stay their gambols on
the sanded floor and look bewildered in her face, then
utter a frightened cry as she wrings again her hands and
shrieks&mdash;'The white man's slave-ship! See its black hulk
scud, with guilty, murderous look, far with my boy away!' "</p>

<p>"O wretched, wronged, and bleeding mother's heart!
Pity her, O heaven! Soothe the wounds that never more
will heal."</p>

<p>"The memory of the vessel's hold, O God! it haunts
me now. Fathers and brothers, in fearful file, the sweet

<!--- vol 2 page 300 -->

air of heaven turning to corruption; the touch of friendship
changed to loathing by continual contact; the restless
agony; the wearisome restraint. Cover the hateful scene,
O Father! from my mind's backward eye; I faint, I die."</p>

<p>"Even so do I."</p>

<p>"The long procession to the mart of sale! The brutish
voice and stare of the unpitying bargainer! Struck off to
the highest bidder like paltry merchandise! A human
soul! A bleeding heart! God's image in his child! Our
Lord's redeemed one. O me! and can it be! They have
forgotten me! Woe! woe! woe! I am, indeed, forlorn."</p>

<p>"Forlorn! forlorn!"</p>

<p>"The long, long hours of labor. No rest and playful
ease under the tamarind tree. No freedom to sleep&mdash;then
sport and gaze into the sunny heavens, or on the deep blue
sea. But work, work, rude, heavy work for him whom
God designed for his brighter, freer, gladder labors.&mdash;And
the harsh whip. I see, I feel it now. Creep, O my flesh!
Flow fresh, my gore, at the wicked, barbarous lash of the
overseer!"</p>

<p>Echo says, "O, oh! I feel it now! Forbear, forbear!"</p>

<p>"Ha! see my helpless sister struggling to be free from
the lewd master's power! Sweet heaven! canst thou thus
shine when, horrible to say! the worse than death betides
her? And I thus manacled! Break, burst my bonds!
Free me, that I may strike the tyrant down! Swallow him,
thou earth, from the sight of God and men! How long?
O Lord! how long?"</p>

<p>Echo repeats, "O Lord! how long!"</p>

<p>"O my dark, heavy soul! My ignorant, unenlightened
mind! Teach me, ye men of privilege and might, to become
the being God would have me be; a glory to his
name! I thirst for knowledge. I crave the wisdom that
He designed for me. My heart and flesh cry out for the
living God. Show me the way to heaven. Teach me of
his revealings."</p>

<!--- vol 2 page 301 -->

<p>"Enlighten me, teach me, men of might! O teach me!
Darkness broods over the feminine soul!"</p>

<p>"I look beyond to Freedom's land. I start renewed to
life. I run, I cut the waves, I reach the shore! Help me!
O help me, freeman! Thou knowest the untold worth, the
incalculable boon of liberty. Give me thy hand. I tire, I
fall. The pursuer is close upon me. Pitiless monster!
Demoniac lust of gold! Paltry man-worship! He hurls
me into the stream, whose current forces me back to bondage
and perdition! Heart of stone! God will adjudge
thee!"</p>

<p>"He will adjudge thee!"</p>

<p>"Again I flee. The strong man welcomes me. I think
to find a friend. But lo! he would use me for most vile
and selfish purposes! I point to heaven and say, 'God's
freeman am I!' He curls his lip. He speaks with scornful
phrase: 'I love thee not! A slave art thou to greed
and fame! I spurn thee from me!' So he, who was to
be my leaning-tower in the new scenes, opening through
my freedom, shrivels at my simple touch, as reed at the
approach of fire. That curling lip! Those scornful words!
O may I die! I weary of my aching life!"</p>

<p>"God help me! So do I," echoes the deep woman-soul.</p>

<p>"And now, poor bondman, whether in slavery's chains
or weighed upon by the stern white-man's laws and rude
and darkened judgment, I come to thee. I have wandered
in the years gone by, half-restless and dismayed, seeing
no soft and mournful eye on which my own could rest and
find response for my deep, thoughtful sorrow.</p>

<p>"But now I gaze far into thine, and see the answer to
my life's woe and yearning wail for sympathy. O come to
me, ye bondmen! Speak to me, captive women! Look
tenderly, ye little ones in Christ, on the still waiting spirit,
who only pleads to be one with you in the kingdom of our
Lord! We will plant deep and rear high his standard in

<!--- vol 2 page 302 -->

our midst, and it shall be the watchword to lead us on to
glory."</p>

<p>"We come, we come!"</p>

<p>Zo&euml; was fast fading away from day to day. She rode
on horseback, and loved to ascend to the summit of the
highest mountain, from which she could see the ocean on
both sides of it, and be fanned by its vast, extended
breath.</p>

<p>When too weak for that, she would be placed in the
carriage, and her father would drive with her for a short
distance into the country, whose fragrant breeze never
failed to revive her.</p>

<p>One day she was going, as usual, to take her airing,
when she felt that her hour of change was approaching.</p>

<p>"Please, take me back to mamma," she said to her
father. He looked into her face, and, without speaking,
laid her head on his shoulder and turned towards home.</p>

<p>Her mother and Hilda received her at the door and
placed her in her favorite arm-chair, where she could look
down the green slope through its trees, which but partially
hid the Caribbean from her view.</p>

<p>Mr. Carlan came and sat beside her. She said to him,
smiling faintly:</p>

<p>"My father! you sent your child away from you that she
might become learned in the world's lore and be fashioned
by its rules. But she brought back to you instead a mind
taught in Christ's school. She could not learn to command
by a haughty demeanor, but she sought the way to be
obedient and lowly. She failed in gaining the good-will
and admiration of her teacher, and such as she; but she
has found abundant bliss in the approval of her Maker.
She closes her short life on this beautiful earth, but she
will find a fairer heaven above. My own good, generous,
and much loved papa! you will build up the heavenly
kingdom more and more within you, I know, and then, ere

<!--- vol 2 page 303 -->

long, you will greet your own Zo&euml;, where no disappointment
shall again roar the bliss of our re-union. Tell me
that it shall be so and I will leave you in peace."</p>

<p>He bowed his head on her hand, and, with faltering
voice, sighed out, "Lord, I believe; help thou my unbelief!"</p>

<p>"Mother, for whom my soul so yearned in the days of
my absence! you have taught me that the spirits are ever
about us, whispering to us pure messages from the sky-born
in the still hour of meditation. Be it so or not, I
know that when I ascend I shall meet <i>your</i> pure twin angel
above, who 'always beholdeth the face of our Father who
is in heaven.' She will reveal to me of your ever-growing
love for your child. And when you are re-united with her,
never again to be divided, O then we will wander together
in sweeter fields than those of earth, and be refreshed by
the fragrant airs which fan the celestials."</p>

<p>"I see her fair form, I feel her soft breath. O hasten
the hour when I too can depart!" said Sophia, looking
upwards with a gaze of intensity and rapture.</p>

<p>"Hilda, my brave, my beautiful and true! who hadst
faith in thy friend, when it was lost to herself&mdash;I have no
need to tell of my heart's best love for my own&mdash;to thee I
commit my most precious and sacred trust. Take this
scroll, and let it be a legacy to my poor people in the country
of your adoption, who, like Tantalus, are nearly immersed
to the brim in the liberty they pant for, and yet
cannot quaff of the stream. O see in each form, however
defaced, the soul of your Zo&euml;, pleading for freedom from
the bonds which enthrall it, and speak thou the hope and
courage which will give it new life."</p>

<p>Hilda arose, seized the manuscript which lay upon the
table, and holding it aloft in the enthusiasm of the moment,
with the glance of a Skald, and the gesture of a Norny,
exclaimed, "Thy people shall be my people, as thy God is
my God! On his help I will rely that He may strengthen

<!--- vol 2 page 304 -->

my heart and the hands of my beloved, until we upturn
every root of oppression from the land of their forced adoption,
and make them equal partakers, with us, of each and
all of its blessings!"</p>

<p>Zo&euml; gazed with kindling eye upon the rapt Sibyl before
her, clasped her hands and looked upward, saying, "Father,
I thank thee! I die content."</p>

<p>The sun was just setting in a sea of glory. He slowly
disappeared below the horizon, coloring the masses of
clouds with purple and crimson as they sailed slowly
athwart the scene of his exit. There was a hush in the
room while all looked toward the pageant, which seemed
to be a fitting accompaniment to the Quadroon's Triumph.
She gazed silently upon it with placid eye, her breath
growing fainter and fainter with the decreasing light,
when, just as it seemed flickering like a candle in the
socket, Ben Ezra stood before her.</p>

<p>He laid his hand upon her shoulder, as if he would stay
the parting spirit in its flight.</p>

<p>"Nay, my friend!" she said, "seek not to recall
me to the earth, but rather ascend yourself to the glorified
spheres, where we will exchange with each other
the <i>sign of the soul</i>, which will unite us forever and
ever."</p>

<p>She ceased to breathe, and when they looked upon her
again, her face was, as it were, the face of an angel.</p>

<p>When Hilda arose from her supporting position by Zo&euml;'s
side, she looked around for Ben Ezra. He had vanished,
but instead of him there lay upon the floor a parchment,
his negative tribute to the value of the spirit of the Scriptures.
She took it up, and started, for there came sounding
to her ear from its deepest centre, in low, weird, dying
tones, these words:</p>

<p>"But when that which is perfect is come, then that
which is in part shall be done away."</p>

<p>They laid upon Zo&euml;'s breast a sprig of the star-jasmin, and

<!--- vol 2 page 305 -->

interred her in a corner of the Episcopal burying-ground,
placing upon her tombstone the simple inscription, "Zo&euml;
Carlan, aged 20. She is not here, but is risen!"</p>

<p>As the small procession was returning from the church-yard,
Jane Rutgard said to Mrs. Strophel, as they sat at
her window gazing upon it, "I hope this girl's death will
be a warning to the colored people not to attempt to educate
their children, beyond the point they need for their low
condition of life. Zo&euml; might have lived to old age and
made a very useful pastry-cook for us, but she has, of
course, died of disappointment that she was not received
into <i>our circle</i>, I am sorry for her father and mother!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Strophel, "I have no doubt she did.
I can't imagine what Hilda ever saw in the girl to fascinate
her so. She seems to me like one bewitched. Now I
think of it, I remember that there were black parrots
always flying about in the grove near Garlands. I begin to
think with the negroes, there is something superstitious
about that bird. As for Zo&euml;, of course, it was the most
absurd thing that could be thought of to attempt to educate
her like a white person. It has only brought trouble
upon herself and her parents, as we see."</p>

<p>And is it true that we must measure the value of a soul's
growth and expansion by the superficial estimate of a half-barbarous
civilization, in which <i>the letter</i> bears sway over
the spirit? That if conventionalism chooses to be owl-eyed
and hoot at any other method of development than its
own one-sided, frigid intellectualism, therefore, the world
is forever to be barren of God's own harmoniously proportionate
souls? No. There shall rise, aside from the present
chaos of philosophies and theologies&mdash;which enlighten
but to blind, which guide but to lead astray&mdash;the pure
religion of Jesus. Like God's "Let there be light!" on
the day of creation, it shall scatter the clouds and vapors
with which poor, weak, presumptuous man has enveloped
the ages. Then will bloom the flower of a new and

<!--- vol 2 page 306 -->

ascending civilization. It shall be lovely as the lily of the
vale, fragrant as the violet, pure and delicate as the anemone,
regal as the rose, and surpassing all others in grandeur,
like the Victoria Regia. It shall be no hot-house
plant, but it will exhale its perfume in the open air to
those who are of the temper to receive it. It shall gladden
by its beauty all classes of the people, and it shall be the
homely but beneficent herb to heal all the ills of humanity.
For God will be the sun to fructify and nourish it; Jesus
the gardener to watch over its growth to perfection; and
the dew of the Holy Spirit will distill ever upon it, perpetually
renewing its life, so that no blight or death can
befall it.</p>
