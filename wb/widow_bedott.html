<h2>INTRODUCTORY.</h2>

</div>

<p>THE Bedott Papers&mdash;now for the first time collected,
were first widely introduced to public notice through the
columns of "Neal's Saturday Gazette."</p>

<p>Its editor&mdash;Joseph C. Neal, the well known author of the
"Charcoal Sketches," was struck by the originality and clearness
of the first of the series, when submitted among the
mass of contributions, which crowd a weekly newspaper.
It was scarcely in print before the author's name began to
be asked by subscribers, casual readers, and brother editors,
some of whom attributed them to Mr. Neal himself. They
could scarcely be made to believe that sketches so full of
humor, so remarkable for minute observation of human nature,
were the work of an unpracticed pen.</p>

<p>A correspondence arising in this way between the editor
and his unknown contributor, Mr. Neal learned that "the
Widow Bedott," as she was familiarly called, had not even
entered the "holy estate," but was still the center of a happy
home circle, in Whitesboro', New York. That she had
never before written for publication, and was so sensitively
modest, and indeed unaware of her remarkable talent as a
humorist, that she was quite willing to cease then and there

<!-- page x -->

the history of the Widow's adventures. Mr. Neal's reply
to this despondent mood, was perhaps decisive as regards
the continuation of the series, and we quote it as preserved
among her papers. It has the more value as being the
unsolicited opinion of a practiced critic who possessed the
keenest natural sense of humor.</p>

<p>"Philadelphia, September, 10th, 1846.</p>

<p>"MY DEAR CORRESPONDENT BEDOTT:</p>

<p>"Your last contributions have been received, and are
truly welcome. The 'Gazette' is again deeply your debtor;
for your aid has been indeed truly valuable to 'Neal.'
But I regret to find that Duberly Doubtington has cast a
'glamour' over you about continuing in the comic vein, just
at the moment too, when all the world is full of Bedott.
Our readers talk of nothing else, and almost despise 'Neal'
if the Widow be not there. An excellent critic in these
matters, said to me the other day, that he regarded them as
the best Yankee papers yet written, and such is indeed the
general sentiment. I know for instance, of a lady who for
several days after reading one of them, was continually,
and often, at moments the most inopportune, bursting
forth into fits of violent laughter, and believe me that you,
gifted with such powers, ought not to speak disparagingly
of the gift which thus brings wholesome satire home to
every reader. It is a theory of mine that <i>those gifted with
truly humorous genius, like yourself, are more useful as moralists,
philosophers, and teachers, than whole legions of the
gravest preachers. They speak more effectually to the general
ear and heart, even though they who hear are not aware of
the fact that they are imbibing wisdom.</i></p>

<p>"To be sure if you have more imperative duties, I should
be the last to wish that you should neglect them; but if

<!-- page xi -->

your hesitations arise from other scruples, it appears to me
that if you were to weigh them well they may be found
mere intangibilities. But of all this you, of course, must
be the judge, and any interference on my part would be intrusive
and impertinent. </p>

<p>"But I would add that Mr. Godey called on me to inquire
as to the authorship of the 'Bedott Papers' wishing evidently
to obtain you for a correspondent to the 'Lady's
Book.' I declined giving him the name, etc., until I had
consulted you, checking the selfish impulse that would have
denied him, that 'Neal' might monopolize a correspondent
so valued as 'Frank.' Would you like to hear from
him on the subject?</p>

<p>"Think on it then before yielding up the pen of comedy,
but in any event, whether you conclude to be either serious
or comic, </p>

<p>"Believe me ever yours,<br/>

"JOSEPH C. NEAL."</p>

<p>The result of Mr. Godey's negotiations will be found in
"Aunt Maguire's Experience"&mdash;Aunt Maguire, being certainly
worthy of her distinguished relationship.*</p>

<p>[*We may here add that, as in the case of Mr. Neal, the friendly interest
of the courteous editor of the "Lady's Book" deepened from that time,
and it is with his warmest approval and predictions of success that the
volume containing both series, is now issued.]</p>

<p>The New Year found Miriam Berry a bride, and separated
from the cherished and cherishing home circle, with new
duties and responsibilities as the wife of a clergyman.
Yet to quote from a charming memorial from the pen of
an almost equally gifted sister, "Her sketches even under
these circumstances, require neither vindication nor apology.
They were never condemned by any except those who felt

<!-- page xii -->

the sting of her satire pricking against their vices. The
good sense of the entire reading public gave them praise,
and their popularity was abundantly shown in the eagerness
with which the country press copied them from the Philadelphia
papers. Her humor was chaste and original, so
true to nature that the most ignorant reader could not fail
to feel its force, and the most refined could discover nothing
that would shock the keenest sensibility. From the time
of Horace to the present, it has always been thought proper,
and often profitable, to 'speak the truth laughing.' And
the best moralists have acknowleged that laughter, when
aimed at folly, was a salutary means of improvement, and
a great aid to virtue. Indeed we have the precedent of Inspiration
itself, to use the most pointed satire in our attempts
to promote the welfare of our fellows. And this
was her only aim; for, whether she depicted the verbosity
of the self-sufficient preacher, or portrayed the vulgar coqueteries
of the inconsolable widow&mdash;whether she held up
to view the would-be literary circle, or narrated the gossip
of the sewing-society, her only object was</p>

<p>" 'the gift to gie 'em<br/>

To see themsels as others see 'em!<br/>

Which wad frae monie a blunder free 'em,<br/>

An' foolish notion.' "</p>

<p>Such, then, was the origin of the "Bedott Papers," their
characteristics and their aim. By the early death of their
wonderfully gifted author, they have become a literary
heritage to her family, and the publication has been decided
upon by them, after repeated solicitations from both

<!-- xiii -->

strangers and friends, who were anxious to have in a collected
and accessible form articles they had enjoyed so much
as fugitive sketches. For ourselves, we have never had but
one opinion. We remember, as if had been but yesterday,
the mirth-moved family circle that listened to the reading
of the first of the series with almost convulsive laughter;
and from that time until we corrected the proof-sheets of
the last, considered them among the cleverest, as they certainly
were the most popular of any humorous articles by
an American author.</p>

<p>Though among Mrs. W&mdash;&mdash;'s* warmest personal friends,
we never had the often desired pleasure of meeting her face to
face. Yet it is through a correspondence bequeathed to us,
as the successor to Mr. Neal's editorial engagements, and
some of his most genial friendships, that the sister before
alluded to, gathered much of the material for a sketch of her
life and character.</p>

<p>[*Miss Berry was subsequently married to Rev. B. W. Whitcher, of
Whitesboro', N. Y.]</p>

<p>Never was there a more remarkable contrast presented,
and we quote her own words, for the causes operating to
produce it. </p>

<p>"Your last kind letter was very gratifying. The acquisition
of a new friend is a source of great pleasure to me; for
I assure you that it has never been my lot to have many
friends. And I will tell you what I believe to be the secret
of it: I received at my birth, the undesirable gift of a remarkably
strong sense of the ridiculous. I can scarcely
remember the time when the neighbors were not afraid that

<!-- page xiv -->

I would 'make fun of them.' For indulging in this propensity,
I was scolded at home, and wept over and prayed with,
by certain well-meaning old maids in the neighborhood; but
all to no purpose. The only reward of their labors was
frequently their likenesses drawn in charcoal and pinned to
the corners of their shawls, with, perhaps, a descriptive
verse below. Of course I had not many friends, even
among my own playmates. And yet, at the bottom of all
this deviltry, there was a warm, affectionate heart&mdash;if any
were really kind to me, how I loved them!</p>

<p>"I think now, that I was not properly trained. My
errors should have been checked in a different way from
that which was adopted. I ought to have received more
tender treatment. I became a lonely child, almost without
companionship; wandering alone, for hours, in the woods
and fields, creating for myself an ideal world, and in that
ideal world I lived for many years. At times I was melancholy
almost to despair. My reserve and sadness were
called haughtiness and pride. When the best part of my
life, or rather what should have been the best part of it,
was gone, I met my husband. He was the first who penetrated
the icy vail about me, sympathized with me, and
turned my feet into a better path than they had trodden
before."</p>

<p>A modest, humble-hearted Christian woman "at the bottom
of all this," as she says, she remained until her pen
was laid aside for the last time, and she passed to a home
where all doubt and misunderstanding are denied an entrance.</p>


<!-- page xv -->

<p>"How she looked, spoke and moved," those who read
these sketches will doubtless ask, as did we, at an early
period of the correspondence. It was met by her with a
playful rhymed response, of which we can recall but a fragment,
declaring she had

<p>"Hands and feet<br/>

Of respectable size,<br/>

<i>Mud-colored</i> hair,<br/>

And dubious eyes."</p>

<p>To the last, she evaded any thing like the self-portraiture so
common among a certain class of female writers, who are as
willing to give their faces as their sketches to the public.</p>

<p>Since this would still seem to be the feeling of those most
easily interested, we pass to the peculiar artistic cleverness
of the original illustrations, which usually accompanied her
"Table Talks." They were done as rapidly as her pencil
could move, a few strokes "telling the whole story." Of
the rise and progress of this remarkable talent, we have
some characteristic anecdotes in Miss Berry's sketch of her
sister's childhood.</p>

<p>"Her school education was more varied than beneficial.
Her first teacher was a sour-faced woman, who knocked the
alphabet with her thimble into the heads of a little group of
unruly children, at so much 'a quarter,' with small love,
and no just appreciation of the dawning minds under her
care. It was the unwise and cruel practice, then more generally
than at present, though still not quite exploded, of
sending little creatures, only four or five years old, to be
shut up in a school-room six hours of each day. </p>

<!-- page xvi -->

<p>"But there was one good custom then, which, where our
limited observation extends, seems to be quite unthought of,
if not despised, in the present girls' schools&mdash;that of teaching
the pupils to sew. The object now appears to be to instruct
them most in what they shall least need to know
afterward. Well, little Miriam was told by her teacher to
bring some kind of work to busy herself with in school;
so, being furnished with a long narrow strip of old muslin,
she went prepared to take her first lesson in the art of
"scolloping." How steadily the small hands stitched away,
till the child was summoned by her serious-faced teacher to
the table, to have her work inspected. What was Miss
&mdash;&mdash;'s amazement on discovering that Miriam had adhered
but a very little way to her pattern, when, leaving it entirely,
she had worked a long row of <i>heads</i> on the muslin, after
a stitch of her own choosing.</p>

<p>" 'What a pity,' said the careful woman who spoke with
a strong nasal accent, 'to waste all that 'ere nice muslin!
Jest take it home, and fetch some old stuff to-morrow; and
work it good, too. Don't make any more of them heads.' </p>

<p>"But Miriam had a piece of bran-new muslin given to her
at home, when she repeated her teacher's orders, with the
permission to make as many heads on it as she pleased.
Whether this act of high-handed rebellion was continued, we
know not; for, in telling the story, as we have heard her do,
with many amusing accessories, she proceeded no further.
This little incident, it would seem, was the most deeply impressed
upon her memory of any thing connected with her
first school-teacher. </p>

<!-- page xvii -->

<p>"A second time was little Miriam introduced within the
walls of the academy, but under a new and quite different
dynasty. The principal was the kindest hearted and most
indulgent of pedagogues, well skilled in mathematics and
learned in all classic lore; greatly successful, moreover, in
'fitting young men for college,' as the phrase goes. But
the younger fry were left to take care of themselves, or at
most received a kind of desultory instruction from some
older pupil, while their misbehavior was kindly overlooked
by the classical master. Lightly passed her school-days
now, but her education, in the true sense of the word was
advancing. Within the school-house walls, the child's already
observant mind and keen perception of the ludicrous
found occupation and food in watching the countenances and
conduct of those who surrounded her; while her lonely
rambles abroad taught her much that your thorough-faced
pedagogue utterly ignores.</p>

<p>"Her slate did not always present the sums in addition
duly set, which it ought. The stiff, tallowed looks and long-nosed
visages of the serious matter-of-fact young men, intently
poring over their Virgils and Latin grammars, on
the opposite side of the room, were oftener transferred by
her pencil to its surface. She could no more keep from
drawing a striking or peculiar set of features, than she could
stop her heart's beating; but she had no thought of giving
pain, and was unwilling to have her pictures seen. Sometimes
a mischievous companion, possessing herself of one,
would display it. If the unfortunate subject had the happy
faculty of taking a joke, he passed it off with a laugh. But

<!-- page xviii -->

a matter-of-fact, shy, sensitive youth regarded Miriam afterward
with insuperable dread. We well remember one,
who, finding himself graphically set forth with the quite
imaginary addition of a parasol over his head, and bows,
with floating ends on his coat skirts, left school in dismay,
and did not again attend.</p>

<p>"Her copy-book presented an appearance very unlike
those of her school-mates. She followed no formally set
copy, but wrote little poems which had struck her fancy in
reading, interspersed with an occasional verse of her own,
the margins being adorned with heads and various devices,
something after the ancient fashion, modernly revived, of
embellishing books.</p>

<p>"In the art of drawing <i>she never had a master</i>, the only
instruction she received being a few hints from a relative
gifted with a like talent. The itinerant professors of painting
and kindred accomplishments who stopped at times, in
her native village, were incapable of improving such an endowment
as hers. Their <i>chefs-d'&oelig;uvres</i> on velvet, their red
and green birds, and extraordinary 'flower-pieces' done by
theorems, their impossible Scripture scenes, gave her infinite
amusement. She should have studied with a true artist,
but no such opportunity presented itself&mdash;a subject of deep
regret to her in after years, as therein she believed the
proper development of her powers could have been found."</p>

<p>Such was the erratic training and chance development of
rare&mdash;indeed almost unprecedented&mdash;original talent; for
what humorist has ever so clearly illustrated his own
sketches of life and character. The very expression of the

<!-- page xix -->

Widow's nose and the Elder's spectacles, are a promise to
the mirth-loving reader of good things at hand; and we
leave them with the assurance that the promise will more
than be fulfilled.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<h3>Hezekiah Bedott.</h3>

</div>

<p>HE was a wonderful hand to moralize, husband
was, 'specially after he begun to enjoy poor
health. He made an observation once when he was
in one of his poor turns, that I never shall forget the
longest day I live. He says to me one winter evenin'
as we was a settin' by the fire, I was a knittin' (I was
always a wonderful great knitter) and he was a
smokin' (he was a master hand to smoke, though the
doctor used to tell him he'd be better off to let
tobacker alone; when he was well, used to take his
pipe and smoke a spell after he'd got the chores done
up, and when he wa'n't well, used to smoke the biggest
part o' the time). Well, he took his pipe out of
his mouth and turned toward me, and I knowed something
was comin', for he had a pertikkeler way of
lookin' round when he was gwine to say any thing
oncommon. Well, he says to me, says he, "Silly,"

<!-- page 22 -->

(my name was Prissilly naterally, but he ginerally
called me "Silly," cause 'twas handier, you know.)
Well, he says to me, says he, "Silly," and he looked
pretty sollem, I tell you, he had a sollem countenance
naterally&mdash;and after he got to be deacon 'twas more
so, but since he'd lost his health he looked sollemer
than ever, and certingly you wouldent wonder at it if
you knowed how much he underwent. He was
troubled with a wonderful pain in his chest, and
amazin' weakness in the spine of his back, besides the
pleurissy in the side, and having the ager a considerable
part of the time, and bein' broke of his rest
o' nights 'cause he was so put to't for breath when he
laid down. Why it's an onaccountable fact that when
that man died he hadent seen a well day in fifteen
year, though when he was married and for five or six
year after I shouldent desire to see a ruggeder man
than what he was. But the time I'm speakin' of he'd
been out o' health nigh upon ten year, and dear
sakes! how he had altered since the first time I ever
see him! That was' to a quiltin' to Squire Smith's a
spell afore Sally was married. I'd no idee then that Sal
Smith was a gwine to be married to Sam Pendergrass.
She'd ben keepin' company with Mose Hewlitt, for
better 'n a year, and every body said <i>that</i> was a settled
thing, and lo and behold! all of a sudding she up
and took Sam Pendergrass. Well, that was the
first time I ever see my husband, and if any body'd

<!-- page 23 -->

a told me then that I should ever marry him,
I should a said&mdash;but lawful sakes! I most forgot, I
was gwine to tell you what he said to me that evenin',
and when a body begins to tell a thing 'I believe in
finishin' on't some time or other. Some folks have a
way of talkin' round and round and round for evermore,
and never comin' to the pint. Now there's
Miss Jinkins, she that was Poll Bingham afore she was
married, she is the tejusest individooal to tell a story
that ever I see in all my born days. But I was a
gwine to tell you what husband said. He says to me
says he, "Silly," says I, "What?" I dident say
"What, Hezekier?" for I dident like his name. The
first time I ever heard it I near killed myself a laffin.
"Hezekier Bedott," says I, "well, I would give up if
I had sich a name," but then you know I had no more
idee o' marryin' the feller than you have this minnit
o' marryin' the governor. I s'pose you think it's
curus we should a named our oldest son Hezekier.
Well, we done it to please father and mother Bedott,
it's father Bedott's name, and he and mother Bedott
both used to think that names had ought to go down
from gineration to gineration. But we always called
him Kier, you know. Speakin' o' Kier, he <i>is</i> a blessin',
ain't he? and I ain't the only one that thinks so,
I guess. Now don't you never tell nobody that I said
so, but between you and me I rather guess that if
Kezier Winkle thinks she is a gwine to ketch Kier

<!-- page 24 -->

Bedott she is a <i>leetle</i> out of her reckonin'. But I was
going to tell what husband said. He says to me, says
he, "Silly," I says, says I, "What?" If I dident say
"what" when he said "Silly," he'd a kept on saying
"Silly," from time to eternity. He always did, because,
you know, he wanted me to pay pertikkeler
attention, and I ginerally did; no woman was ever
more attentive to her husband than what I was.
Well, he says to me, says he, "Silly." Says I,
"What?" though I'd no idee what he was gwine to
say, dident know but what 'twas something about his
sufferings, though he wa'n't apt to complain, but he
frequently used to remark that he wouldent wish his
worst enemy to suffer one minnit as he did all the
time, but that can't be called grumblin'&mdash;think it can?
Why, I've seen him in sitivations when you'd a
thought no mortal could a helped grumblin', but <i>he</i>
dident. He and me went once in the dead o' winter
in a one hoss slay out to Boonville to see a sister o'
hisen. You know the snow is amazin' deep in that
section o' the kentry. Well, the hoss got stuck in
one o' them are flambergasted snow-banks, and there
we sot, onable to stir, and to cap all, while we was a
sittin' there, husband was took with a dretful crick in
his back. Now <i>that</i> was what I call a <i>perdickerment</i>,
don't you? Most men would a swore, but husband
dident. He only said, says he, "Consarn it." How
did we get out, did you ask? Why we might a been

<h3>The Widow Essays Poetry.</h3>

</div>

<p>YES&mdash;he was one o' the best men that ever trod
shoe-leather husband was, though Miss Jinkins
says (she 'twas Poll Bingham) <i>she</i> says, I never found
it out till after he died, but that's the consarndest lie
that ever was told, though it's jest of a piece with
every thing else she says about me. I guess if every
body could see the poitry I writ to his memory, nobody
wouldent think I dident set store by him.
Want to hear it? Well, I'll see if I can say it; it
ginerally affects me wonderfully, seems to harrer up
my feelins; but I'll try. Dident know I ever writ
poetry? how you talk! used to make lots on't; haint
so much late years. I remember once when Parson
Potter had a bee, I sent him an amazin' great cheese,
and I writ a piece o' poitry and pasted on top on't.
It says:</p>

<p>Teach him for to proclaim<br/>

Salvation to the folks,<br/>

No occasion give for any blame<br/>

Nor wicked people's jokes.</p>

<p>And so it goes on, but I guess I won't stop to say the
rest on't now, seein' there's seven and forty verses.

<!-- page 27 -->

Parson Potter and his wife was wonderfully pleased
with it, used to sing it to the tune o' Haddem. But I
was gwine to tell the one I made in relation to husband,
it begins as follers:</p>

<p>He never jawed in all his life,<br/>

He never was onkind&mdash;<br/>

And (tho' I say it that was his wife)<br/>

Such men you seldom find.</p>

<p>(That's as true as the Scripturs, I never knowed him
to say a harsh word.)</p>

<p>I never changed my single lot&mdash;<br/>

I thought 'twould be a sin&mdash;</p>

<p>(though widder Jinkins says it's because I never had
a chance.) Now 'tain't for me to say whether I ever
had a numerous number o' chances or not, but there's
them livin' that might tell if they was a mind to;
why, this poitry was writ on account of being joked
about Major Coon, three year after husband died. I
guess the ginerality o' folks knows what was the
nature o' Major Coon's feelins toward me, tho' his
wife and Miss Jinkins <i>does</i> say I tried to ketch him.
The fact is, Miss Coon feels wonderfully cut up 'cause
she knows the Major took her "Jack at a pinch"&mdash;seein'
he couldent get such as he wanted, he took such
as he could get&mdash;but I goes on to say&mdash;</p>

<p>I never changed my single lot&mdash;<br/>

I thought 'twould be a sin&mdash;<br/>

For I thought so much o' Deacon Bedott<br/>

I never got married agin.</p>

<!-- page 28 -->

<p>If ever a hasty word he spoke<br/>

His anger dident last,<br/>

But vanished like tobacker smoke<br/>

Afore the wint'ry blast.</p>

<p>And since it was my lot to be<br/>

The wife of such a man,<br/>

Tell the men that's after me<br/>

To ketch me if they can.</p>

<p>If I was sick a single jot<br/>

He called the doctor in&mdash;</p>

<p>That's a fact&mdash;he used to be scairt to death if any thing
ailed me, now only jest think&mdash;widder Jinkins told
Sam Pendergrasses wife (she 'twas Sally Smith) that
she guessed the deacon dident set no great store by
me, or he wouldent a went off to confrence meetin'
when I was down with the fever. The truth is, they
couldent git along without him no way. Parson Potter
seldom went to confrence meetin', and when he
wa'n't there, who was ther, pray tell, that knowed
enough, to take the lead if husband dident do it?
Deacon Kenipe hadent no gift, and Deacon Crosby
hadent no inclination, and so it all come on to Deacon
Bedott&mdash;and he was always ready and willin' to do
his duty, you know; as long as he was able to stand
on his legs he continued to go to confrence meetin';
why, I've knowed that man to go when he couldent
scarcely crawl on account o' the pain in the spine of
his back. He had a wonderful gift, and he wa'n't a
man to keep his talents hid up in a napkin&mdash;so you
see 'twas from a sense o' duty he went when I was

<!-- page 29 -->

sick, whatever Miss Jinkins may say to the contrary.
But where was I? O&mdash;</p>

<p>If I was sick a single jot<br/>

He called the doctor in&mdash;<br/>

I sot so much store by Deacon Bedott<br/>

I never got married agin.</p>

<p>A wonderful tender heart he had<br/>

That felt for all mankind&mdash;<br/>

It made him feel amazin' bad<br/>

To see the world so blind.</p>

<p>Whiskey and rum he tasted not&mdash;</p>

<p>That's as true, as the Scripturs&mdash;but if you'll believe
it, Betsy, Ann Kenipe told my Melissy that Miss Jinkins
said one day to their house how't she'd seen
Deacon Bedott high, time and agin! did you ever!
Well, I'm glad nobody don't pretend to mind any
thing <i>she</i> says. I've knowed Poll Bingham from a
gal, and she never knowed how to speak the truth&mdash;besides
she always had a pertikkeler spite against husband
and me, and between us tew, I'll tell you why
if you won't mention it, for I make it a pint never to
say nothin' to injure nobody. Well, she was a ravin-distracted
after my husband herself, but it's a long
story, I'll tell you about it some other time, and then
you'll know why widder Jinkins is etarnally runnin'
me down. See&mdash;where had I got to? O, I remember
now&mdash;</p>

<p>Whiskey and rum he tasted not&mdash;<br/>

He thought it was a sin&mdash;<br/>

I thought so much o' Deacon Bedott<br/>

I never got married agin.</p>

<!-- page 30 -->

<p>But now he's dead! the thought is killin'<br/>

My grief I can't control&mdash;<br/>

He never left a single shillin<br/>

His widder to console.</p>

<p>But that wa'n't his fault&mdash;he was so out o' health for
a number o' year afore he died, it ain't to be wondered
at he dident lay up nothin'&mdash;however it dident give
him no great oneasiness&mdash;he never cared much for
airthly riches, though Miss Pendergrass says she heard
Miss Jinkins say Deacon Bedott was as tight as the
skin on his back&mdash;begrudged folks their vittals when
they came to his house! did you ever! why he was
the hull-souldest man I ever see in all my born days.
If I'd such a husband as Bill Jinkins was I'd hold
my tongue about my neighbors' husbands. He was a
dretful mean man, used to git drunk every day of his
life&mdash;and he had an awful high temper&mdash;used to
swear like all possest when he got mad&mdash;and I've
heard my husband say&mdash;(and he wa'n't a man that
ever said any thing that wa'n't true)&mdash;I've heard <i>him</i>
say Bill Jinkins would cheat his own father out of his
eye teeth if he had a chance. Where was I? O!
"His widder to console"&mdash;ther ain't but one more
verse, 'tain't a very lengthy poim. When Parson
Potter read it, he says to me, says he&mdash;"What did
you stop so soon for?"&mdash;but Miss Jinkins told the
Crosby's <i>she</i> thought I'd better a stopt afore I'd begun&mdash;she's
a purty critter to talk so, I must say. I'd
like to see some poitry o' hern&mdash;I guess it would be

<!-- page 31 -->

astonishin' stuff; and mor'n all that, she said there
wa'n't a word o' truth, in the hull on't&mdash;said I never
cared tuppence for the deacon. What an everlastin'
lie!!  Why&mdash;when he died, I took it so hard I went
deranged, and took on so for a spell they was afraid
they should have to send me to a Lunattic Arsenal.
But that's a painful subject, I won't dwell on't. I
conclude as follows:</p>

<p>I'll never change my single lot&mdash;<br/>

I think 'twould be a sin&mdash;<br/>

The inconsolable widder o' Deacon Bedott,<br/>

Don't intend to get married agin.</p>

<p>Excuse my cryin'&mdash;my feelins always overcomes me
so when I say that poitry&mdash;O-o-o-o-o-o!</p>

<h3>Widow Jenkins' Animosity.</h3>

</div>

<p>O, YES! I remember I promised to tell you the
cause o' widder Jinkinses ennimosity to me&mdash;Melissy,
pass the bread&mdash;well, you see, Deacon Bedott
(he wa'n't deacon then though) he come&mdash;help yorself
to butter, dew&mdash;he come to Wiggletown to teach the
deestrict school. He was origginally from the Black
River kentry. His father was a forehanded farmer,
and he'd give Hezekier a complete eddication&mdash;he
took to larnin' naterally. Is your tea agreeable? I
s'pose ther wa'n't his equil for cypherin' no wher
round. Well, Squire Smith he was out in them parts,
and he got acquainted with Hezekier, and he see that
he was an oncommon capable young man, and so he
conduced him to come to Wiggletown and teach school.
Kier, pass the cheeze to Miss Higgins. Don't never
eat cheeze! dew tell! well, <i>husband</i> couldent eat cheeze
without impunity durin' the last years of his life&mdash;used
to say that it lay like a stun on his stomick; as
sure as he eat a piece o' cheeze for his supper, he'd
lay awake groanin' all night, if he dident take some

<!-- page 33 -->

kind of an antigote to pervent it. But I was gwine
to tell&mdash;Well, the day after he come to our place,
Squire Smith's folks had a quiltin'&mdash;I was there&mdash;'twa'n't
long afore Sally was married (she 'tis Sam
Pendergrasses wife)&mdash;she was a makin' her quilts&mdash;though
'twas ginerally thought she was engaged to
Mose Hewlet, and as to that matter, it's my opinion
she might better a had him than the one she <i>did</i> have.
I never thought Sam Pendergrass was much&mdash;none
o' the Pendergrasses ain't no great shakes, though
he's good enough for Sal Smith. Melissy, why don't
you sarve out the sass? That sass ain't fust-rate&mdash;you
see, while 'twas a dewin' Loviney Skinner, she
come in with that are subscription paper, to git up a
society for "the univarsal diffusion of elevation among
the colored poperlation," and while I was lookin' at it
to see who'd signed and how much they gi'n, the sass
got overdid. But I was gwine to tell about that
quiltin'. Ther was a number o' young folks there&mdash;see&mdash;there
was Prissilly Poole (that's me), Poll Bingham
(Bill Jinkinses widder), Huddy Hewlit (she
married Nat Farntash and both on 'em died to the
westard a number o' years ago), and Sally Smith
(Sam Pendergrasses wife), and the Peabodys (Jerushy
married Shadrack Dany&mdash;but Betsy ain't married
yet, though I s'pose if ever any body tried
faithfully to git a husband Bets' Peabody has), and
Nab Hinksten (she 'tis Major Coon's wife now),

<!-- page 34 -->

though then she wa'n't nothin' but a milliner's apprintice.
I remember, I wondered at the Smiths for
invitin' her, but they never was pertikkeler who they
went with, and she always had a wonderful way o'
crowdin' in. See&mdash;you heerd, dident you, how't she
said I tried to ketch the Major, but he lookt ruther
higher 'n to marry widder Bedott? He must a lookt
consarn-ed high when he took Nab Hinksten! She's
a purty critter to be a tryin' to disperse my character,
I dew say! I'll let her know't Deacon Bedott's
widder ain't a gwine to be put down by the like o' her.
What was she, pray tell, in her young days? I make
it a pint never to say nothin' against nobody&mdash;but
truth ain't no slander, think it is? and all creation
knows she wa'n't nobody. Why her father was a
poor drunken shack away down in Bottletown, and
her mother took in washin', and Nab Hinksten herself
worked out for a half a dollar a week, till Miss Potter
was down there one time a visitin' Parson Potter's relations,
and she took pity on her and fetched her up
to Wiggletown to live with her; but after a spell she
got above dewin' housework and went into Miss Dickerson's
milliner shop, and there she stayed till Zeb
Hawkins married her, and after he died o' delirreum
trimmins, she sot tew to ketch somebody else, and at
last she draw'd in Major Coon&mdash;he'd been disappinted
('tain't for me to say who disappinted him) and so
he dident care much who he married: and now she's

<!-- page 35 -->

<i>Miss Major Coon!</i> O, deary me it's enough to make
a body sick to see the airs she puts on. Did you see
her come nippin' into meetin' last Sabber day with
that are great long ostridge feather in her bunnit, and
a shawl as big as a bed kiver? But I could put up
with her if she wouldent slander her betters. She
and Miss Jinkins is wonderful intimit now, though I
remember when Poll Bingham hild her head high
enough above Nab Hinksten, at that quiltin' she
dident scarcely speak to her. Is your cup out? Take
some more bread&mdash;not no more? why you don't eat
nothing&mdash;I'm afeard you won't make out a supper&mdash;well
dew take a piece o' the sweetcake&mdash;I ain't sure
about it bein' good, Melissy made it and she's apt to
git in a leetle tew much molasses&mdash;but them nutcakes
<i>I know</i> is good, for I made 'em myself, and I dew
think I make nutcakes <i>about</i> as good as any body
else. Kier's a wonderful favoryte o' nutcakes, ain't
you Kier? but his father couldent eat 'em at all for
a number o' year afore he died&mdash;they were tew rich
for his stomick&mdash;jest as sure as he eat a nutcake he
used to have a sick spell afterward. But I was a
gwine to tell how Poll Bingham come to take such a
spite against me&mdash;well, the beginnin' on't commenced
at that are quiltin'. In the evenin' you see the young
men come. There was Hezekier Bedott&mdash;Zeb Hawkins
(he 'twas Miss Coon's fust husband, he got to be
a worthless critter afore he died), and Shubal Green

<!-- page 36 -->

(he was a wonderful good singer, had an amazin'
powerful voice, used to sing in meetin' and nigh about
raise the ruff o' the meetin'-house off), and Zophar
Slocum&mdash;he was studyin' to be a doctor, he was a
smart young man but dretfal humbly: he used to
write the poitry for the "Wiggletown Banner." He
got dretfully in love with a young woman once, and
she dident recipperate his feelins&mdash;'tain't for me to
tell who the young woman was. I don't approve o'
tellin' such things&mdash;well, he got into such a takin' on
account o' her coldness, that at last he writ her a letter
tellin' of her how't he couldent stan such undifference
no longer, and if she continood to use him so, he was
determined to commit self-suiside&mdash;at the end o' the
letter, he put in a varse o' poitry&mdash;it says&mdash;

<p>O, 'tis a dretful thing to be<br/>

In such distress and miseree!<br/>

I'm eny most a natteral fool<br/>

All on account o' Silly Poole!</p>

<p>There! I've let on who 'twas&mdash;hain't I? but he
altered his mind about killin' himself, and was married
about three months after to Sophier Jones. Take
another nut-cake&mdash;dew. Why, what a small eater
you be! I'm afeared the vittals don't suit you.
Well, less see who else was there. O, Tim Crane.
He was a wonderful <i>saftly</i> feller&mdash;dident scarcely
know enough to go in when it rained, though he was
purty sharp at makin' money. He married Trypheny

<!-- page 37 -->

Kenipe, Deacon Kenipe's sister&mdash;they went to the
westard, and I've heered they'd got to be quite rich.
I guess it must be owin' to Miss Crane's scrapin'
and savin', for she was the stingiest of all created
critters. What did you say, Kier? Tim Crane
comin' back here to live? Well, 'twon't be no great
addition to Wiggletown, for they ain't&mdash;What!
Kier Bedott? Miss Crane dead! Land o' liberty!
what an awful thing! Dear me! I dew feel amazin'
sorry for Mr. Crane! how onfortinate! to lose his
wife! such a nice woman as she was, tew! What did
you say, Melissy Bedott! How't I jest called Miss
Crane a stingy critter? you must a misunderstood me
a purpose! I said she was an oncommon equinomical
woman. I always thought a master sight of Miss
Crane, though I must say she wa'n't quite good
enough for such a man as Timothy Crane. He's an
amazin' fine man, I said he dident know nothing?
Kier Bedott, how you <i>dew</i> misunderstand. I meant
that he was a wonderful unoffensive man, well-disposed
toward every body. Well, I'm glad Mr.
Crane's a comin' back here; should think '<i>twould</i> be
melancholy to stay there after buryin' his pardner.
His poor motherless darters, tew! I feel for <i>them</i>. It's
a dretful thing for galls to be left without a mother!
Melissy, what be you winkin' to Kier for? Don't you
know it's very improper to wink? Kier, did Deacon
Kenipe say what complaint Miss Crane died of? The

<!-- page 38 -->

eperdemic! how you talk! that's a turrible disease!
I remember it prevailed in our place when I was quite
young&mdash;a number o' individuals died on't. I don't
wonder Mr. Crane wants to git away from the westard,
it must be very onpleasant to stay to a place
where his companion was tore away from him by such
an aggravatin' complaint as the eperdemic. Won't
you be helped to nothing more?&mdash;O, sure enough&mdash;I
was goin' to tell how Poll Bingham came to be such
an inimy o' mine&mdash;now, I shouldn't wonder if she
should set tew and try tew ketch Mr. Crane when he
comes back, should you? I'll bet forty great apples
she'll dew it, she's been ravin' distracted to git married
ever since she was a widder, but I ruther guess Timothy
Crane ain't a man to be took in by such a great
fat, humbly, slanderin' old butter tub. She's as gray
as a rat, tew, that are hair o' hern's false. I'm gray
tew. I guess you haint told no news now, Melissy
Bedott. I know I'm <i>ruther</i> gray, but it's owin' to
sickness and trouble. I hadn't a gray hair in my head
when yer par died. I ain't as old as widder Jinkins,
by a number o' year. I think 'twould be a good
idear for some friendly person to' warn Mr. Crane
aginst Poll Jinkins as soon as he gits here, don't you?
I <i>dew</i> feel for Mr. Crane. Kier, I wish you'd invite
him to step in when you see him, I want to convarse
with him, I feel to sympathize with him in his afflictive
dispensation. I know what 'tis to lose a pardner.</p>

<h3>Mr. Crane Walks In.</h3>

</div>

<p>WALK in! Why Mr. Crane how dew you dew?
I'm despot glad to see you&mdash;amazin' glad.
Kier told me you'd arriv' several days ago, and I've
been suspectin' you in every day sence. Take a cheer
and set down&mdash;dew;&mdash;Why Mr. Crane, you hold yer
own wonderfully, don't grow old a speck as I see.
Think I've altered much? Don't, hay? Well, Mr.
Crane, we've both on us had trouble enough to make
us look old. Excuse my cryin', Mr. Crane. I've
ben dretfully exercised ever sence I heerd o' your
affliction. O! Mr. Crane! what poor short-sighted
critters we be! can't calkilate with any degree o' sartinty
what's a gwine to happen. Parson Potter used
to say 'twas well we didn't know the future, cause
'twould have an attendency to onfit us for dewin' our
duty; and so 'twould&mdash;if you and I'd a knowed
when you went away fifteen year ago, what we'd got
to undergo, 'twould a nigh about killed us, wouldn't
it?  O! Mr. Crane! Mr. Crane! Creation has dealt
purty hard with us sence we parted! Then, you had

<!-- page 40 -->

a wife&mdash;an uncommon likely woman she was tew&mdash;and
I was blest with one o' the best o' men for a
husband&mdash;now, I'm a widder, and you're a widdyiver.
But our loss is their gain&mdash;at least I'm sartin
my loss is Deacon Bedott's gain. O! Mr. Crane, how
that man did suffer for a number o' year afore he died;
but he was the resignedest critter I ever <i>did</i> see&mdash;never
grumbled a grain. Parson Potter used to say
'twas to eddification to come to see him, and hear him
convarse. He felt wonderful bad about your bein'
gone to the westard, Mr. Crane. He used to frequently
remark, that he'd giv more to see Mr. Crane than
ary individdyival he knowed on. He sot a great deal
by you&mdash;and so did I by Miss Crane. We both on
us felt as if we couldn't be reconciled to your livin'
away off there&mdash;it seemed as if we couldn't <i>have</i> it so
no way. It's a dretful pity you went there, Mr.
Crane. Mabby if you hadn't a went, yer pardner
wouldn't a died&mdash;but what's did can't be ondid, it's
all for the best, I was turribly evercome when I
heerd o' her death&mdash;fainted away, and 'twas quite a
spell afore I come tew. That's a bad clymit, Mr.
Crane&mdash;it <i>must</i> be a bad clymit, or the eperdemic, and
fever ager wouldn't prevail so there. A few year afor
husband died, <i>he</i> had quite a notion to go to the westard.
He heerd how well you was a dewin'&mdash;and then
there was Samson Bedott, his cousin (he married Hepsy
Gifford, you know), <i>he</i> went some where to the westard&mdash;and

<!-- page 41 -->

after he'd ben there a spell, he writ my husband
a letter, urgin' of him to come out there, he said
to be sure the clymit was ruther tryin' at fust&mdash;but then
after you'd got used to't, you'd be ruggeder 'n ever
you was afore&mdash;and it was such a wonderful kentry
for agricultifer to grow&mdash;said 'twa'n't nigh so mountanious
as the eastard&mdash;the yomandery didn't have to
labor no wher nigh so hard as what they did here&mdash;just
plant your perduce and that was the eend on't&mdash;'twould
take care of itself till 'twas time to git it in.
Well, husband was quite fierce to go&mdash;and if it hadn't
a ben for me, he <i>would</i> a went, but I wouldn't hear
to't at all. I says to him, says I, " 'Twon't dew for
you to go there, no how&mdash;Samson, himself, owns it's
a tryin' clymit&mdash;and if it's tryin' for well hearty folks,
how do you 'spose <i>you'd</i> stan' it? you enjoy poor
enough health here, and if you was to go there you'd
enjoy woss yet, what's agricultifer compared to
health?" I was a great deal more consarned for husband
than what I was for myself, Mr. Crane&mdash;be sure
it's a woman's duty to feel so, but seems to me I felt
it oncommonly. And no wonder, for my husband
<i>was</i> a treshur. O! Mr. Crane, when I lost <i>him</i> I lost
<i>all</i>. And that's what makes me feel to sympathize
with you as I dew, Mr. Crane. Our sittywations are
so much alike. I 'spose you feel as if your loss
couldn't never be made up to you, don't you? That's
jest how I felt. Now there's Major Coon, and Mr.

<!-- page 42 -->

Gifford, and Squire Perce, and Cappen Canoot, and
old uncle Dawson (he's old but he's quite rich), why,
nary one o' them wouldn't a filled Deacon Bedott's
place to me. 'Tain't for me to say they've all wanted
me&mdash;ahem&mdash;but s'posen they should, you know.
Whenever my friends begin to talk to me about
changin' my condition, I always tell 'em it's a <i>resk</i>&mdash;and
so 'tis Mr. Crane&mdash;it's a turrible resk to take a
second pardner&mdash;without it's an individdyival you
know'd when you was young&mdash;<i>that</i> makes a difference&mdash;'tain't
so resky, <i>then</i>. But after all, Mr, Crane&mdash;it's
a tryin' thing to be without a companion&mdash;ain't it?
And then there's the responsibilitude and bringing
up the children&mdash;widders complains most o' that.
But there's a wonderful difference in folks about that.
Now 'twa'n't no great chore for me to bring up my
children. Parson Potter's wife fraquently used to
say (she had quite a large family, you know), she used
to say to me, "Miss Bedott I'd giv eny, most eny
thiag if I had such a faculty for managin' children
as you've got, and for dewin' as well by 'em as what
you do." Ther <i>is</i> an amazin' difference in wimmin&mdash;now
ther's the widder Jinkins&mdash;she 'twas Poll Bingham&mdash;see&mdash;you
knowd Poll Bingham when she was
a gal, didn't you? Very nice gal did you say!!!
Why Mr. Crane, how forgetful your memory is! But
I don't know as she was so much woss than <i>some</i> other
gals I've knowd. A body can't tell what sort of a

<!-- page 43 -->

woman a gal <i>will</i> make afore she's married&mdash;they
don't always show out, you know. But I make it a
pint never to say nothing against nobody&mdash;and I am
sure I don't wish Miss Jinkins no harm&mdash;for all she's
did so much to injure me. I was only gwine to speak
o' her way o' bringin' up her children, 'Tis astonishin'
how that critter has managed with them young
ones! She's the miserablest hand I ever did see in
all my born days. Why them little plagues was in
the streets from mornin' till night&mdash;Bill and Sam a
swearin' and throwin' stuns&mdash;and Alviry a racin' and
rompin' and botherin' the neighbors. They've got
bigger now and ain't quite so troublesome, though
they're bad enough yet&mdash;but that ain't to be wondered
at&mdash;for Miss Jinkins has so much gaddin' to dew she
hain't no time to tend to her family. But if that was
all ther was against her 'twouldn't be so bad. However&mdash;I
don't want to talk about her&mdash;truth ain't to
be spoken at all times you know&mdash;but I <i>will</i> say I
should pity any decent man that got her for a wife&mdash;'specially
if he had children. Speakin' o' children&mdash;you
must feel Miss Crane's loss dretfully in takin' care
o' yourn. It's an awful task for a man to manage
gals, Mr. Crane&mdash;and you've got four on 'em&mdash;Mirandy
and Seliny is purty well growd up&mdash;but then
them tew little ones&mdash;see&mdash;what's ther names? O,
yes&mdash;Liddy and Sary Ann. What purty little critters
they be though! I noticed them in meetin' a Sabberday&mdash;O

<!-- page 44 -->

Mr. Crane! when I looked at them poor little
darlin's&mdash;a settin' there all in mournin'&mdash;and thought
about their motherless sittywation&mdash;I felt as if I
should a bust right out a cryin'! I had to hold my
handkerchief afore my face. O Mr. Crane! I dew
feel for them children! It's so onfortinate to be left
without a mother!&mdash;jest at their age tew&mdash;when they
have so much vivacitude and animosity, and need a
mother's care for to train 'em rightly. O Mr. Crane!
it's turrible! turrible! What would Melissy a did if
it had a ben me that died instid of her par? She
wa'n't but ten year old, just about the age o' them
little cherubims o' yourn. My husband was an oncommon
gifted man&mdash;and a wonderful kind father&mdash;but
he wouldn't a did by Melissy as I have&mdash;he
wouldn't a knowed how to expend her mind and devilup
her understandin' as I have&mdash;but I've got a
natteral tack. Melissy's a credit to me, Mr. Crane&mdash;tho'
it's me that says so, she's eny most as good a
housekeeper as what I be, but 'tain't for me to boast&mdash;I've
been indefategable in train' of her. I'm sorry
she hain't to hum to-night&mdash;she and Kier's gone to
singin' school. Yes&mdash;it's an onfortinate thing for
gals to be left without a mother. It was dretful Miss
Crane's bein' took away&mdash;so sudding tew&mdash;I feel so
distrest about your moloncolly sittywation I can't
scarcely sleep o' nights. I've jest begun a piece o'

<p>GOOD evenin', Betsy&mdash;[Mr. Crane's "help."]&mdash;Is
Mr. Crane to hum? Is he in the kitchen? in
the settin' room, hey? Ain't very well? why how
you talk! Well, I want to see him a minnit, but I
guess I'll jest step in the kitchin fust and dry my feet.
I'd no idee 'twas so sloppy or I'd a wore my overshoes&mdash;seems
to me you're got yer kitchen heated up
wonderful hot&mdash;O, stewin yer punkin, hey? I've
been makin some pies to-day, tew. You must have a
purty hard time here, Betsy. Mr. Crane's a fine man,
<i>a very</i> fine man&mdash;a very fine man, <i>indeed</i>&mdash;but 'tain't
as if he had a wife&mdash;<i>now</i> every thing comes on his
<i>help</i>, you see&mdash;the gals is nice gals&mdash;amazin' nice gals
but they hain't no experience&mdash;never had no care you
know&mdash;and 'tain't natral to s'pose they could take
right hold and <i>dew</i>, as soon as ther mar died. But it
sems rather hard to see so much come onto a young
gal like you. On <i>your</i> account I wish Mr. Crane had
a wife, 'twould be so much easier for you&mdash;that is if
he got a good experienced woman o' biziness&mdash;that

<!-- page 48 -->

had brung up a family of her own&mdash;don't you think
so?&mdash;Well, my feet's got purty well dry&mdash;I guess I'll
step into the settin' room and see Mr. Crane&mdash;I've got
an arrant tew him. How d' you dew, Mr. Crane?
I'm dretfal sorry to hear you ain't well, I wa'n't a
comin' in&mdash;but Betsy said you was undisposed&mdash;and I
was unwillin' to make you egspose yerself by comin'
to the door&mdash;so I thought I'd jest step in where you was&mdash;hope
I don't intrude&mdash;I jest run over to fetch that
are poitry I've ben writen for you&mdash;I would a gin it
to yer darters&mdash;they called in for Melissy to go to singin'
school&mdash;but I was afeard they'd lose it afore they
got hum.&mdash;young gals is kerless, you know. Here
'tis&mdash;'tain't so long as I meant to have, arter all&mdash;only
nine and forty varses&mdash;but I've had company&mdash;sister
Magwire (she 'twas Melissy Poole, you know&mdash;my
youngest sister, the one my Melissy was named arter)
she's ben to see me, and stayed a week, and when a
body has company it kind o' flustrates a body's idees,
you know. And then, tew, sister Magwire don't take
no interest in no such thing. She's a very clever woman,
Melissy is, but she ain't a bit like me&mdash;hain't no
genyus&mdash;no more hain't sister Harrinton&mdash;why they
don't nary one on 'em take no more sense o' poitry
than that are stove. If I had a let on to sister Magwire
what I was a writin', she'd a tried to stop me&mdash;had
to work at it o' nights arter she'd went to bed&mdash;and
that's the reason why I hain't finished it afore.

<!-- page 49 -->

Sister Magwire's a smart woman, tew in <i>her way</i>&mdash;but
it's a different kind o' smart from mine. I think her
bein' married to such a man has exarted an onfavorable
attendency on her.  Mr. Magwire's a stiddy,
well-meanin' man&mdash;and has got along amazin' prosperous
in the world&mdash;but he has dretful curus notions.
Why, when I writ that affectin' allegory to the memory
o' my husband, as true as I live, Mr. Crane, brother
Magwire laffed about it right to my face!&mdash;said
'twas enough to make the deacon groan under ground&mdash;did
you ever! I felt dretful hurt about it, but I
never laid it up agin him 'cause I know'd he dident
know no better. But I dew feel wonderful consarned
about yer health, Mr. Crane. What seems to be the
matter with you? Pain in yer chist! O! that's turrible!&mdash;it
always scares me to death to hear of any
body's havin' a pain in ther chist. Why-that very
thing was the beginnin' o' my husband's sickness, that
finally terminated in his expiration. It ought to be
tended tew right off, Mr. Crane, right off. When
husband fust had it, 'twa'n't very bad, and he dident
pay no tention to't&mdash;next time 'twas rother woss, and
I wanted him to send for the doctor, but he wouldent&mdash;he
was always amazinly opposed to physicianers.
Well, the next time he was attacked 'twas dretful bad&mdash;he
had to lay by&mdash;still all I could dew I couldent
conduce him to have a doctor. Well it went on so
for three days. I done all I could for him, but it

<!-- page 50 -->

dident do a smite o'good&mdash;he kept a gittin' woss and
woss, and the third day he was so distrest it <i>did</i> seem as
if every breath he draw'd would be the death on him.
Jest then old mother Pike come in&mdash;she was quite a
doctor, you know&mdash;and she said he must take skoke
berries and rum right off&mdash;ther wa'n't nothin' like it
for pain in the chist&mdash;she always kep it in the house&mdash;so
she goes right hum and fetches over a bottle on't
and gin husband a wine glass full. She said he must
begin with a purty stiff dose, 'cause he'd let it run on
so long&mdash;arterward a gret spunful night and mornin'
would be enough. Well, 'tis astonishin' how soon
my husband experienced relief. Arter that he always
took it as long as he lived, and I dew believe it allivated
his sufferings wonderfully&mdash;yes&mdash;I hain't a doubt but
what if he'd a took it afore his disorder was seated, that
man'd a been alive and well to this day. But what's
did can't be ondid&mdash;it's no use cryin' for spilt milk.
Now, Mr. Crane, I dew beseech you, as a friend, to
take skoke berries and rum afore it's tew late. Temperance
man, hey? So be I, tew; and you don't
s'pose, dew you, Mr. Crane, that I'd advise you to take
any thing that would intosticate you? I'd die afore
I'd dew it. I think tew much o' my repertation and
yourn tew, to do such a thing. But it is the harmlessest
stuff a body can take. You see the skoke berries
counterects the alkyhall in the rum, and annyliates
all its intosticatin' qualities. We jest put the rum on

<!-- page 51 -->

to make it keep. You know skoke berries can't be
got in the winter time, so if you want to presarve
'em for winters, you've got to put some sort o' sperits
tew 'em so's they won't spyle. So don't you be none
afeard to take it, Mr. Crane. I'll send you some
when I go hum&mdash;I always keeps it on hand&mdash;and
you be faithful and take a great spunful night and
mornin'&mdash;and if you ain't the better for't, afore long&mdash;then
I'm out o' my calkilation&mdash;that's all. You must
feel yer loss oncommonly when you ain't well, Mr.
Crane. If ever a departed companion's missed&mdash;seems
to me it must be when the afflicted surviver's
sick&mdash;'specially if it's a <i>widiwer</i> that's lost his wife.
How awful lonesome you <i>must</i> be here alone, when
the children's in bed and the gals has gun off&mdash;as I
s'pose they fraquently dew when evenin' comes&mdash;and I
don't blame them for't as I know on&mdash;it's natural for
young folks to like to <i>go</i>. How dretful lonesome you
must be. Now <i>some</i> men wouldent mind it so much&mdash;they'd
go abroad and divart ther minds&mdash;but <i>you</i>
ain't a man to go to taverns and shops and such like
places to begwile the time&mdash;<i>you're</i> a man that's above
such things, Mr. Crane&mdash;and that's what makes it so
aggrevative for you to be without a pardner. I went
into the kitchen to dry my feet as I came in&mdash;and O,
Mr. Crane! I never did experience such moloncolly
sensations in my life as I did when I see how things
went on there&mdash;'twas plain to be seen ther want no

<!-- page 52 -->

<i>head</i> in the kitchenary department&mdash;and when 'tain't
well managed <i>there</i>&mdash;I tell you what, Mr. Crane&mdash;'twon't
be long afore it'll be out o' kilter every where.
Now Betsy Pringle's a clever enough gal fur as I
know&mdash;but she's young and onstiddy, and wants
lookin' tew every minnit. She lived to Sam Pendergrasses
a spell&mdash;and Miss Pendergrass told me how't
Betsy could <i>dew</i>&mdash;but she wanted somebody to her
heels, t'overlook her all the time&mdash;she was such a
kerless critter&mdash;said <i>she</i> couldent git along with her
no way. Now if Sam Pendergrasses wife couldent
stan' it with Betsy, it's a mystery to me how tew
young gals like yourn is a gwine to git along with her.
They hain't never had no care, and 'tain't to be suspected
they should know how to manage&mdash;'twould be
cruel to require it on 'em. It needs an experienced
woman&mdash;and one that takes an <i>interest</i> in things, to
keep house right. Ther was one thing hurt my feelins
amazinly when I was in the kitchen&mdash;Betsy was
a stewin' punkins for pies&mdash;I knowd in a minnit by
the smell, that the critter was a burnin' on't up. I
dident say nothin'&mdash;thought mabby she'd be put out
if I did, cause I ain't mistress here&mdash;but I couldent
scercely hold in. I'll be bound, Mr. Crane, you won't
have a punkin pie fit t' eat all winter long&mdash;and it
makes me feel bad to think on't&mdash;for I make gret account
o' punkins in winter time&mdash;don't you? Speakin'
o' punkins reminds me of a trick Miss Jinkins

<!-- page 53 -->

sarved me once (she 'twas Poll Bingham)&mdash;I never see
a punkin without thinkin' on't&mdash;and it's tew good to
keep&mdash;though I don't want to say nothin' to injure
Miss Jinkins. 'Twas tew year ago this fall&mdash;somehow
or other our punkins dident dew well that year.
Kier said he dident know whether the seed was poor,
or what 'twas&mdash;any how, our punkins dident come to
nothin' at all&mdash;had to make all my punkin pies out o'
squashes&mdash;and <i>them</i> ain't no wher nigh as good as punkins.
Well, one day I see Sam and Bill Jinkins go
by with a load o' punkins&mdash;so I says to Mellissy, says
I, "I mean to jest run over and see if Miss Jinkins
won't let me have one o' her punkins,"&mdash;the sight on
'em fairly makes my mouth water. So I throws on
my shawl and goes over&mdash;though I very seldom axed
any favors o' her&mdash;notwithstandin' she was etarnally
borrerin' o' me&mdash;why ther want scarcely a day past
but what she sent to borrer somethin or other&mdash;a loaf
o' bread&mdash;or a drawin' o' tea&mdash;or a little molasses or a
little sugar, or what not&mdash;and what's more&mdash;she wa'n't
wonderful pertickler about payin'&mdash;and it's a sollem
fact&mdash;the times that critter has had my bake pans and
my flats and my wash board, ain't to be numbered. I
make it a pint never to borrer when I can help it.
Ther <i>is times</i> to be sure&mdash;when the best o' housekeepers
is put to't and obleged to ax favors o' ther nabors&mdash;but
as for borrerin' every day&mdash;week in and week
out, as the widder Jinkins does&mdash;ther ain't no need

<!-- page 54 -->

on't&mdash;but she can't stay to hum long enough to keep
things in any kind o' decent order. But I was gwine
to tell how she sarved me about the punkin. Well&mdash;I
goes over&mdash;and I says, says I, "Miss Jinkins, I see
you're a gittin' in yer punkins&mdash;and I want to know
whether or no you can't spare me one&mdash;ourn's failed,
you know." "Well," says she, "we hain't got more
'n enough for our own use&mdash;but seein' it's <i>you</i>, I guess I
<i>will</i> let you have one." So she went and fetched in
one&mdash;quite a small one 'twas. "What's the price on't?"
says I (I dident s'pose she'd tak any thing, for I'd gin
her a mess o' turnips a few days afore&mdash;but I thought
I'd offer to pay). "What's the price on't?" says I.
"O nothin' at all," says she. "Lawful sakes!" says I,
"you don't s'pose I want to <i>beg</i> it, dew you? I meant
to pay the money down." "You'd look well," says
she, "a payin' for't&mdash;don't you s'pose I can afford to
giv away a punkin?&mdash;purty story if I can't!"
"Well," says I, "thank you a thousand times&mdash;you
must come in to-morrer arter I git my pies made and
help eat some." "Well, mabby I will," says she&mdash;so
I takes my punkin and goes hum mighty pleased.
Well, next day Melissy and me we cut up the punkin&mdash;'twas
dretfal small and wonderful thin&mdash;and when
I come to stew it&mdash;my gracious! how it <i>did</i> stew
away! The fact is 'twas a miserable <i>poor</i> punkin&mdash;good
punkins don't stew down to nothin' so. Milessy
she lookt into the pot and says she to me, says she,

<!-- page 55 -->

"Granf'ther grievous! why mar I'm afeard this ere
punkin's gwine to exasperate intirely, so ther won't be
nun left on't." Well sure enough&mdash;arter 'twas sifted&mdash;as
true as the world, Mr. Crane&mdash;ther want more'n
a pint on't. "Why, mar," Milessy, says she&mdash;" 'twon't
make more 'n <i>one</i> good sized pie." "Never you fear,"
says I&mdash;"I'll bet forty gret apples I'll git three pies
out on't any way." Some folks, you know, puts
eggs in punkin pies, but accordin' to my way o' thinkin,
'tain't no addition. When I have plenty o' punkin
I never use 'em&mdash;but Miss Jinkinses punkin turned
out so small, I see I shouldent have nun to speak on
without I put in eggs; so I takes my punkin and I
stirs in my molasses, and my milk, and my eggs, and
my spices, and I fills three of my biggest pie-pans.
"There," says I to Melissy, "didn't I say I'd make
three pies, and hain't I did it?" "Yes," says she,
"but they're purty much all ingrejiences, and precious
little punkin." Well, we got 'em in the oven, and
jest as I was gwine to put in the last one, somebody
knockt at the door. Melissy was a handin' on't to me,
and she was ruther startled, you know, when she
heerd the knock, and she jerked away quite sudding,
and spilt about half the pie out. I wiped it up as
quick as I could, and Melissy she opened the door,
and lo and behold! who should come in but the widder
Jinkins! Arter she'd sot a spell she says, says
she, "Well, Miss Bedott, how did you make out with

<!-- page 56 -->

yer pies?" "O, very well," says I. "I'd jest got 'em
in the oven when you come in." I thought, seein' she
gin me the punkin, I wouldent say nothin' about its
bein' such a miserable one. Mustent find fault in a
gift hosses mouth, you know. "Well, when my pies
was done I takes 'em and sets 'em on the table.&mdash;"Them
<i>looks</i> nice," says the widder, says she. "They
<i>be</i> nice," says I. I knowed they was nice, for they
had every thing in 'em to <i>make</i> 'em nice. So I took
the thin one that Melissy spilt over, and sot it in the
buttry winder to cool, so's to give Miss Jinkins a piece.
I took <i>that</i> cause I knowd 'twould cool sooner'n t'
others, on account of its bein' thinner. Well, when
my pie was cool, I fetcht it out and sot it afore Miss
Jinkins, and I gin her a knife and a fork, and says I,
"Now help yerself. Miss Jinkins," and I tell you, the
way she helpt herself was a caution. Melissy lookt
as if she was ready to burst out laffin; I was raly
afeard she would. Arter she'd put in about half the
pie, she laid down her knife and fork, and says she,
"This ere pie ain't cool enough yet accordin' to <i>my</i>
way of thinkin'&mdash;I never did fancy warm punkin pies,"
So she riz up to go. "don't go. Miss Jinkins," says
I, "dew wait a spell and I'll set it out door&mdash;it'll cool
there in a few minnits&mdash;you gin me the punkin and I
want you should have yer share o' the pie." "Mercy
on us!" says she, "I hope you don't spose I consider
a punkin such a mighty gret gift&mdash;I was very glad of

<!-- page 57 -->

a chance t' obleege you&mdash;but it's time I was hum&mdash;I
guess I won't mind about eaten any more o' that there
pie&mdash;I never did fancy thin punkin pies&mdash;<i>these ere tew'll
be as much as I want</i>." And jest as true as I live
and breathe, the critter actilly took them tew pies and
sot 'em crossways&mdash;one a top o' t'other and marched
off with 'em! When she got to the door she turned
round, and says she&mdash;"Now Miss Bedott, whenever
you want any little favor, such as a punkin or any
thing else I've got that you hain't got&mdash;don't scruple
to ask for't&mdash;it always affords me the greatest gratification
to dew a nabor a kindness." Arter she'd gone, I
lookt at Melissy and Melissy lookt at me in a perfect
state o' dumfounderment! we was so bethunderstruck,
'twas as much as five minnits I guess afore ary one of
us spoke a word. At last says Melissy says she,
"Did you ever!" "No, never! never!" says I, and
then we sot up such a tremendous laff that Kier heerd
us (he was to work out door), and he came in to see
what was the matter, so I told him&mdash;and good gracious
how he did roar! I tell you, he hain't never let
me hear the last o' that punkin&mdash;I don't know to this
day whether Miss Jinkins knowd I stewed up the hull
o' the punkin to once or not&mdash;but I dew raly bleve if
she had a knowd it, 'twouldent a made a speck o' difference
about her taken the pies, for she was always
the very squintessence o' meanness. Land o' liberty!
It's nine o'clock&mdash;I'd ought to ben hum an hour ago.

Now, Mr. Crane, I dew hope you'll take care o' yerself
in season, and take my medicine&mdash;I'll send Kier over
with it as soon as I get hum&mdash;and mind you take a
gret spunful night and mornin' as long as you have
any pain in yer chist&mdash;it's a wonderful help to't. And
dew be kerful about egsposin yerself to the cold air&mdash;don't
go out without rappin' up warm&mdash;remember the
equinoxical storms is a comin' on soon, and them's
dretful bad for invalidders. O Mr. Crane, 'twould be
an awful thing if; you should be took away! I can't
bear to think on't&mdash;excuse my cryin', Mr. Crane&mdash;I
can't help it&mdash;I dew feel such an interest in yer family
and&mdash;I hope you won't think I'm forrard, Mr. Crane&mdash;but
I dew&mdash;I dew&mdash;I dew&mdash;set a great deal&mdash;by
you, Mr. Crane.</p>

<h3>The Widow Loses her Beau.</h3>

</div>

<p>MELISSY! Melissy! Melissy Bedott! Why,
what on arth's come o' the critter! I'm sure
she went up chamber a spell ago, to fix up, and I
ain't seen her come down sence. You set down,
gals, and I'll jest run up and see 'f she's there. Why,
Melissy, what in natur do you mean by keepin' me a
yellin' all night? Did anser, hey? well, you'd ought
to leave yer door open so's a body could hear you,
and not be obleeged to trot way up here arter you.
Come down, right off. Seliny, and Mirandy Crane's
down stairs&mdash;they want you to go to the Phreenyogical
lectur with 'em. Ther par's a gwine, but he's
bizzy and ain't ready yit, and he told 'em not to wait
for him, 'cause it might be late afore he could git
away. So they come arter us, 'cause they dident like
to go alone. Me gwine? Why yes, to be sure&mdash;why
shouldent I? I never heerd a phreenyogical lectur,
and I've got considerable curosty to see what 'tis.
I'll go put on my things. Melissy'll be down in a
minit. She insists on't I shall go, tew, and I guess I

<!-- page 60 -->

will&mdash;I always thought I should like to hear one o'
them kind o' lecturs! [They enter the lecture room.]
Less go back side, as fur away from the stove as we
can git, it's so awful hot here. What! you afeard o'
the men folks, Mirandy? I don't care if 'tis right
amongst the loafers and boys. I never see that man
yit, nor boy nother, 't I was afeard on. Gracious
sakes alive! dew look o' them dead folkses heads on
the table! What awful looking things they be!
Made o' plaster, hey? Well, I'm glad on't&mdash;shan't
feel so dizgusted lookin' at 'em as I should if they
was rael heads. What a curus lookin' critter that
lecturer is, ain't he? How he has got his hair all
scraped up! makes him look kind o' skairt. Name's
Mr. Vanderbump, ain't it? Wonder if that are woman
without a bunnit on's Miss Vanderbump? What
an awful big head she's got! <i>Her</i> forrid's all bare,
tew&mdash;how it sticks out! Sign of intellect? Goody
grievous! I wouldent care for that. If I had such a
humbly face I'd keep it kivered up, wouldent you?
Dew see! there comes Sam Pendergrasses wife, with
that everlastin' boy o' hern. She takes that young
one every where&mdash;and he always acts like Sanko. I
guess she'll find it purty warm there, right aside o'
the stove. Look, Seliny! there's Cappen Canoot&mdash;I'll
bet a cookey he called for me. Well, I'm glad I'd
come away afore he'd got there. I don't want none
o' <i>his</i> company. I don't know what he expects to

<!-- page 61 -->

gain by stickin' round me so. I hain't never gin him
no incurridgement, and don't intend tew. Of all
things! if there ain't Major Coon's wife, with that
flambergasted old red hood o' hern on! Dew, for
pity's sake, see how she sails along. And then, there
comes the Major grinin' along behind her, as if she
<i>was</i> the eend o' the law. I s'pose if ever a man was
completely under his wife's thumb, Major Coon is.
But they say he thinks she's clear perfection; well,
it's well ther's <i>somebody</i> thinks so. Kier was tellin' a
speech old Green made about her t'other day. Old
Green's a musical old critter, you know; well, he was
in Smith's store, and Kier was there, and Major Coon,
and a number of other men. The Major was a talkin'
about his wife&mdash;you know how he's forever talkin'
about her&mdash;well, he was a praisin' on her up, tellin'
how smart, and keen, and industrous she was, and all
that. Bymeby he went out, and says old Green, says
he, "The Major does think his wife's the very <i>dyvil,
and so do I, tew</i>." Old Green'd no bizness to said it,
but when Kier told on't, I couldent help laffin'. Well
done! If there ain't the widder Jinkins! I wonder
if ever any thing goes on in Wiggletown without that
woman's bein' on the spot! I never <i>did</i> see any body
so beset to <i>go</i> as she is. If I was her I <i>would</i> stay to
hum jest <i>once</i>, so's to see how 'twould seem&mdash;wouldent
you?</p>

<p>There! Mr. Vanderbump is agwine to begin! [The

<!-- page 62 -->

lecturer expatiates on the wonderful science of Phrenology&mdash;gives
a history of the various specimens&mdash;points
out the organs, etc., etc., and just as he concludes
this part of the performance, Mr. Crane enters.] Seliny&mdash;I
<i>dew</i> begin to feel ruther timmorsome settin' here
with all them rowdies behind us&mdash;don't you? If we
had a gentleman with us I shouldent feel oneasy,
should you? Ain't that yer par over yonder?&mdash;s'pose
you go ax him to come and set here long with us&mdash;I
should feel safer&mdash;[Selina goes and returns with her
father, who sits down beside the widow.] Good evenin',
Mr. Crane! I hope you won't take it amiss, my
sendin' for you to come and set over here, for I raly
felt as if I <i>should</i> fly away, with all those 'ere loafers
right behind us&mdash;was afeard they'd say something
sassy tew us. And then, tew, I was expectin' every
minit when old Canoot would be makin' a dive for
this quarter&mdash;and I know'd he wouldn't if he see you
here. O, Mr. Crane, you can't imagine how I dew
dred that critter. I couldent bear the idee a' havin'
on him go hum with me to-night&mdash;don't want t' incurridge
him. How do you feel this evenin', Mr. Crane?
better 'n you did, hey? well, I dew feel thankful for't.
Took them skoke berries and rum, did you? Well,
that's what helped you, depend on't&mdash;but you
mustent git slack about takin' on't&mdash;stick tew it faithfully.
Hadent you better take yer comforter off
yer neck till you go out? you won't be so likely

<!-- page 63 -->

to ketch cold. You've got to be kerful&mdash;very kerful,
Mr. Crane&mdash;you need somebody to see tew you all the
time <i>and</i> make you kerful, the gals is young and
thoughtless, and don't think on't&mdash;but that ain' surprisin'.
I'm sorry you wa'n't here sooner, Mr. Crane.
This 'ere phreenyology's the curusest thing I ever
<i>did</i> see. Did you ever see any thing to beat it&mdash;how
he can tell an individiwal's character so egzactly by
the looks o' their heads? don't seem to me as if it
could be so&mdash;does it to you? I can't raelize I've got
such a numerous number of organs in my head&mdash;can
you?&mdash;O, Mr. Crane; what a musical man you be!
you'll make me die a laffin! Seliny! jest hear what
your par says. I axed him if he could raelize he had
so many organs in his head:&mdash;and he said how't
t'other day when he had such a turrible cold in it, it
seemed is if there was organs, and fiddles, and drums,
and every thing else in't&mdash;did you ever?&mdash;I wish
you'd a ben here sooner, Mr. Crane, to hear Mr. Vanderbump's
exparigate about them heads&mdash;he gin a description
of the people they belonged tew&mdash;and told
how ther characters was accordin' to ther heads.
That are big head&mdash;the one that runs up to such a
peak on top&mdash;he says, that's Scott the celebrated author&mdash;I
s'pose it's the one that writ "Scott's Commontaries"
on the Scripters. He says it's a wonderful
intillectible head: no doubt on't&mdash;husband sot a
gret deal by his Commontaries&mdash;used to borrer 'em o'

<!-- page 64 -->

parson Potter&mdash;Mr. Scott must a' ben a smart man to
write 'em. That are small curus shaped one on the
corner&mdash;that's the head of an underwitted critter that
died' in one o' the poor houses&mdash;hain't got no intellectible
organs at all. That are skull that sets behind
Mr. Scott&mdash;that's Old Gibbs the pyrit, that was extecuted
a number o' years ago&mdash;he was a turrible old
villing. Mr. Vanderbump said that was old Gibb's
skull positively <i>bony fidy</i>. That is&mdash;it's giniwine
bones&mdash;the rest on 'em's made o' plaster. But that
are head that sets aside o' the commentater&mdash;the one
that's got such a danglin' under lip and flat forrid and
runs out to such a pint behind&mdash;that's old mother
O'Killem, the Irish woman that murdered so many
folks&mdash;she was an awful critter. He said 'twa'n't to
be disputed though, that she'd done a master sight o'
good to menkind&mdash;he reckoned they ought to raise a
moniment tew her&mdash;'cause any body that lookt at her
head couldent persume no longer to doubt the truth o'
phreenyology. He told us to obsarve the shape on't
perticlerly. You see the forrid's dretful flat&mdash;well,
that shows how't the intellectible faculties is intirely
wantin'. But he dident call it <i>forrid</i>. He called it the
<i>hoss frontis</i>. I s'pose that's 'cause it's shaped more
like a hoss than a human critter&mdash;animal propensitudes
intirely predominates, you know. That's what
makes it stick out so on the back side&mdash;that's the
<i>hoss hindis</i> I s'pose&mdash;<i>hoss frontis</i> and <i>hoss hindis</i>, you

<!-- page 65 -->

know. I felt oncomonly interested when he was a
tellin' about her, 'cause I've read all about her in
"Horrid Murders"&mdash;a book I've got&mdash;it's the interestinest
book I've read in all my life. It's enough to
make yer hair stand on eend. I've ben over it I
guess half a dozen times&mdash;and it seems interestiner
every time. Husband got it of a pedlar the year afore
he died, and he used to take an amazin' deal o' comfort
readin' on't. Time and agin I've knowd that
man to lie awake half the night arter he'd ben readin'
in "Horrid Murders." He was narvous, you know&mdash;I feel wonderfully attached to that book 'cause 'twas
such a favorite o' husband's. Every thing 'twas dear
to husband is dear to me&mdash;Mr. Crane&mdash;that's one reason
why I set store by you&mdash;<i>he</i> reckoned on you so
much. I'll lend you that book Mr. Crane&mdash;you'll be
delighted with it. You can jest step in with me when
we go hum and I'll let you take it. You'll be
amazinly pleased with the account o' Miss O'Killem.
She murdered five husbands and a number of other individiwals,
and it tells all how she killed each one on
'em. Some she cut ther throats and some she burnt,
and some she chopped to pieces. O 'tis awful interestin'.
What did you say, Mr. Crane? That gal with
such red cheeks settin' right by the table, do you mean
O, that is Kesier Winkle, she always contrives to get
a seat where she'll be seen. She takes quite a notion
to Kier&mdash;but I guess she'll miss a figger there. Kier

<!-- page 66 -->

Bedott ain't a feller to be drawd in by a purty face&mdash;<i>he</i>
wants something besides that&mdash;tho' I never thought
she was so wonderful handsome, do you&mdash;her cheeks
is red to be sure, but every body can have <i>such</i> a color
if they want&mdash;you understand, hey! tho' 'tain't for
me to say she paints, never standin' there is them that
says so. I'm very glad Kier don't, think o' havin' on
her&mdash;I never did like the Winkles. Old Winkle's a
hard old case, and they <i>dew</i> say Kesier's considerable
like him.</p>

<p>There! I guess Miss Pendergrass has got roasted
out&mdash;she's a comin' this way with her admyrable boy&mdash;don't
see what she wants to crowd in here for&mdash;should
think she might find a seat somewhere else&mdash;shouldent
you? [Mr. Crane relinquishes his seat to
Mrs. Pendergrass and takes the one she left.] Good
evenin', Miss Pendergrass! found yer sittivation rather
warm, hey? Well&mdash;<i>I</i> make it a pint never to change
my seat in meetins and lecturs and such places, when
other folks is obleeged to change theirn t' accommerdate
me. I think <i>I</i> can afford to be oncomfortable as
well as other folks can&mdash;hope Mr. Crane won't ketch
his death a cold when he goes out, on account o' brylin'
and stewin' there by the stove&mdash;he ain't well at
all. O don't git up, Miss Pendergrass&mdash;dew sit still
now you've got here. What a curus consarn this
phreenyology is, ain't it? What an age of improvement
we live in! If any body'd a told us once

<!-- page 67 -->

how't in a few year we'd be able to tell egzackly
what folks <i>was</i> by the shape o' ther heads&mdash;we wouldent
a bleeved a word on't&mdash;would we? You remember
readin' about old mother O'Killem, in that are
book I lent you, don't you? Well, he's mistaken
about one thing relatin' to her. He says she killed
the niggar wench by choppin' off her head&mdash;now
'twa'n't so&mdash;she stomped on her&mdash;I remember just
how 'twas, don't you? Ain't his wife a turrible humbly
woman? Her head looks jist like a punkin, and
hisen looks like a cheese, don't it? You gwine to
hear her lectur to the ladies to-morrer? Guess <i>I</i> shall&mdash;if
it's as interestin' a lectur as hisen, it'll be worth
hearin'&mdash;though I don't think much o' these here
wimmin lecturers, no way&mdash;the best place for wimmin's
to hum&mdash;a mindin' their own bizness, accordin'
to my notions. You remember that one that come
round a spell ago, a whalin' away about human rights.
I thought she'd ought to be hoss-whipt and shet up
in jail, dident you? Dew, for pity's sake, look at
Major Coon's wife a blowin' herself with her pocket-handkercher!
Did you see her when she come in?
Dident she cut a spludge, tho'? I never <i>did</i> see such
an affected critter as she is in all my born days. When
you see any body put on such airs as she does, you may
be sure they was raised up out o' the dirt. They're
what Kier calls "the mud aristocrasy." She gwine
to have a party Thursday evenin'? How you talk!&mdash;how

<!-- page 68 -->

did you hear?&mdash;told you herself, hey? Is she
gwine to have married folks and young folks both?
Well, them's the right kind o' parties&mdash;enough sight
pleasanter 'n where they're all married folks or all
young folks&mdash;don't you think so? Well, I should
think she'd have a party&mdash;hain't never gin a reglar
smasher yit&mdash;and they're able to dew it. It's pleasant
to git a body's friends and nabors together&mdash;has an
attendancy to permote sociabilitude. I always thought
Miss Coon was a nice woman. Folks has a good deal
to say about her, cause she was a hired gal when she
was young&mdash;but I never thought 'twas any thing
against her&mdash;Miss Jinkins used to run her down dretfully
afore they got to be so intimit&mdash;and whenever
she used to begin a slanderin' Miss Coon afore me, I
always made it a pint to stan' up for her. I've sometimes
thought she was <i>ruther affected</i>&mdash;hain't you?&mdash;but
then you know it's natral for some folks to be
affected&mdash;I hope Mr. Crane's settin' with me to-night
won't make any talk. I shouldent wonder tho' if it
should&mdash;it don't take nothin' to make a story in Wiggletown&mdash;but
I couldent git up and go off, you know,
when he come and sot down by me&mdash;t' wouldent a ben
perlite&mdash;s'pose you're heerd he'd called t' our house
a number o' times? Hain't?&mdash;well that's curus&mdash;it's
all over town. I wish folks wouldent be gitten' up
such reports about me. Mr. Crane's a fine man&mdash;a
very fine man&mdash;but if folks thinks I've any idee o'

<!-- page 69 -->

changin' my condition at present, they're mistaken.
I hain't begun to think about no such thing yit. I
think it's a pity if Mr. Crane can't call t' our house
once in a while, without the hull naborhood bein' in
a blaze about it&mdash;I eny most hope he won't see me
hum to-night&mdash;cause <i>that</i> would make folks say 'twas
a gone case with us sartin sure. I see Kier come in
a spell ago&mdash;hope <i>he'll</i> go with me&mdash;though I s'pose
he's come a purpose to go hum with some o' the gals.
There! the lectur's out&mdash;Seliny, wait a minnit till the
crowd gits along&mdash;I don't want to be squashed to
death&mdash;look, Miss Pendergrass! dew see the widder
Jinkins a squeezin' up along side o' Mr. Crane&mdash;did
you ever! If that ain't <i>rich!</i> I guess if she thinks
she's a gwine to ketch him she's mistaken. As true
as the world she's took his arm, and he's a gwine
hum with her! Well&mdash;I'll bet forty great apples she
axed him tew. [The young ladies have beaux, and
Kier very dutifully escorts his mother home, <i>just as
she hoped he would</i>.]</p>

<p>JEST in time, Mr. Crane&mdash;we've jest this minnit
sot down to tea&mdash;draw up a cheer and set by&mdash;now
don't say a word&mdash;I shan't take <i>no</i> for an answer.
Should a had things ruther different to be sure, if I'd
suspected <i>you</i>, Mr. Crane&mdash;but I won't appollygise&mdash;appolligies
don't never make nothin' no better, you
know. Why, Melissy, you hain't half sot the table.
Where's the plum sass? thought you was a gwine to
git some on't for tea. I don't see no cake nother.
What a kerless gal you be? Dew bring 'em on quick&mdash;and
Melissy, dear, fetch out one o' them are punkin
pies and put it a warmin'. How do you take yer tea,
Mr. Crane? clear, hey? how much that makes me
think o' husband! he always drunk hisen clear. Now
dew make yerself to hum, Mr. Crane&mdash;help yerself to
things. Do you eat johnny cake? 'cause if you don't
I'll cut some wheat bread&mdash;dew hey? we're all gret
hands for injin bread here, 'specially Kier. If I don't
make a johnny cake every few days, he says to me,
says he, "Mar, why don't you make some injin bread?

<!-- page 71 -->

it seems as if we hadent never had none." Melissy,
pass the cheeze. Kier, see't Mr. Crane has butter.
This ere butter's a leetle grain frowy. I don't want
you to think it's my make, for 'tain't&mdash;Sam Pendergrasses
wife (she 'twas Sally Smith) she borrered butter
o' me t'other day, and this 'ere's what she sent
back. I wouldent a had it on if I'd suspected company.
How do you feel to-day, Mr. Crane? Dident
take no cold last night? well, I'm glad on't, I was
raly afeared you would, the lectur room was so turrible
hot I was eny most roasted, and I wa'n't drest
wonderful warm nother, had on my green silk mankiller&mdash;and
that ain't very thick. Take a pickle, Mr.
Crane&mdash;I'm glad you're a favorite o' pickles. I think
pickles is a delightful beveridge&mdash;don't feel as if I
could make out a meal without 'em&mdash;once in a while
I go a visitin' where they don't have none on the
table&mdash;and when I git hum the fust thing I dew's to
dive for the buttry and git a pickle. But husband
couldent eat 'em&mdash;they was like pizen tew him. Melissy
never eats 'em nother&mdash;she ain't no pickle hand.
Some gals eats pickles to make 'em grow poor, but
Melissy hain't no such foolish notions, I've brung
her up so she <i>shouldent</i> have. Why&mdash;I've heerd o'
gals drinkin' vinegar to thin 'em off and make ther
skin delekit. They say Kesier Winkle&mdash;why Kier,
what be you pokin' the sass at Mr. Crane for? Melissy
jest helped him. I heered Carline Gallup say how't

<!-- page 72 -->

Kesier Winkle&mdash;why Kier what dew you mean by
offerin' the cold pork to Mr. Crane? jest as if he
wanted pork for his tea! you see Kier's ben over to
the Holler to-day on bizness with old uncle Dawson,
and he come hum with quite an appertite&mdash;says to
me, says he "Mar, dew set on some cold pork and
taters, for I'm as hungry as a bear." Lemme fill up
yer cup, Mr. Crane. Melissy, bring on that are pie, I
guess it's warm by this time. There! I don't think
any body'd say <i>that</i> punkin was burnt a stewin'.
Take another pickle, Mr. Crane. O, I was a gwine to
tell what Carline Gallup said about Kesier Winkle,
Carline Grallup was a manty maker&mdash;what, Kier?
ruther apt to talk? well, I know she <i>was</i>&mdash;but then
she used to be sowin' 't old Winkle's about half the
time, and she know'd purty well what went on there&mdash;yes&mdash;I
know sowin' gals is ginerally tattlers. It's a
turrible bad trait in any body&mdash;'specially in them&mdash;they
hain't no bizness to go round from house to
house a tellin' what guz on among folks that finds
'em ther bread and butter. I never incurridge 'em in
it. When I have manty makers to work for me&mdash;as
sure as they undertake to insiniwate any thing aginst
any o' my nabors&mdash;I tell ye, I shet 'em up quicker&mdash;but
I was gwine to tell what Carline Gallup said&mdash;Carline
was a very stiddy gal&mdash;she was married about
a year ago&mdash;married Jo Bennet&mdash;Philander Bennet's
son&mdash;you remember Phil Bennet, don't you, Mr.

<!-- page 73 -->

Crane? he 'twas killed so sudding over to Ganderfield?
Though come to think, it must a ben arter
you went away from here. He'd moved over to
Ganderfield the spring afore he was killed. Well, one
day in hayin'-time he was to work in the hay-field&mdash;take
another piece o' pie, Mr. Crane&mdash;O dew&mdash;I insist
on't. Well, he was to work in the hay-field, and he
fell off the hay-stack. I s'pose 'twouldent a killed
him if it hadent a ben for his comin' kersmash onto a
jug that was a settin' on the ground aside o' the stack.
The spine of his back went right onto the jug and
broke it&mdash;broke his back, I mean&mdash;not the jug&mdash;<i>that</i>
wa'n't even cracked&mdash;curus! wa'n't it? 'Twas quite
a comfort to Miss Bennet in her affliction&mdash;'twas a jug
she vallyed&mdash;one 'twas her mother's. His bein' killed
so was a turrible blow to Miss Bennet, the circumstances
was so aggravatin'. I writ a piece o' poitry
on the occasion and sent it tew her; she said 'twas
quite consolin'. It says:</p>

<p>O Ganderfield!<br/>

Where is thy shield<br/>

To guard against grim Death?<br/>

He aims his gun<br/>

At old and young,<br/>

And fires away their breath!</p>

<p>One summer's day<br/>

For to 'tend tew his hay,<br/>

Mr. Bennet went to the medder&mdash;<br/>

Fell' down from the stack&mdash;<br/>

Broke the spine of his back,<br/>

And left a mournin' widder!</p>

<!-- page 74 -->

<p>'Twas occasioned by his landin'<br/>

On a jug that was standin'<br/>

Alongside o' the stack o' hay&mdash;<br/>

Some folks say 'twas <i>what was in it</i><br/>

Caused the <i>fall</i> of Mr. Bennet,<br/>

But ther ain't a word of truth in what they say&mdash;</p>

<p><i>'Twas</i> true, though, and I know'd it, but of course I
wouldent a had Miss Bennet s'pose I did for all creation.
She sticks to't to this day 'twas molasses and
water 'twas in the jug. That's a likely story!
Why! 'twas a common report for better 'n a year
afore he was killed, that Phil Bennet was a gittin onsteady,
but I never let Miss Bennet know't I had any
such idee. She and me was always quite intimit.
She was Lorainy Perce, old Peter Perce's darter; you
know I sot a gret deal by Lorainy. She took it purty
hard when her husband was killed; she went into
awful deep mournin'&mdash;mournin' was becomin' tew her,
she was a dark complected woman; and she wa'n't
satisfied with wearin' mournin herself, 'twa'n't enough,
she even put black 'caliker bed-kivers onto her bed.
I remember she had a black canton crape gownd all
trimmed with crape; but she dident wear her mournin'
long, for she got married agin in about three
months&mdash;married a man by the name o' Higgins&mdash;carpenter
and jiner by trade: got acquainted with
him over in Varmount, when she was there a visitin'
tew her sister's&mdash;quite a forehanded man. But I was
a sayin' that poitry&mdash;where had I got tew! O! I
know:</p>

<p>Well&mdash;I'll give it up&mdash;I've forgot it&mdash;that's a settled
pint. It's queer, tew&mdash;it's the fust time I ever disremembered
any o' my poitry&mdash;but it can't be helped&mdash;mabby
it'll come tew me some time. If it does,
I'll write it down and show it to you, Mr. Crane&mdash;I
know you'd be pleased with it. Take another cup o'
tea, Mr. Crane. Why! you don't mean to say you've
got done supper! ain't you gwine to take nothin'
more? no more o' the pie? nor the sass? well, won't
you have another pickle? O, that reminds me&mdash;I
was a gwine to tell what Carline Gallup said about

<!-- page 76 -->

Kesier Winkle. Why, Kier seems to me you ain't
very perlite to leave the table afore any body else
does. O, yes, I remember now, it's singin'-school
night&mdash;I s'pose it's time you was off, Melissy&mdash;you
want to go tew don't you? well, I guess Mr. Crane'll
excuse you. We'll jest see the table back agin the
wall&mdash;I won't dew the dishes jest now. Me and Melissy
does the work ourselves, Mr. Crane. I hain't
kept no gal sence Melissy was big enough t'aid and
assist me&mdash;I think help's more plague than profit.
No woman that has grow'd up darters needent keep
help if she's brung up her gals as she'd ought tew.
Melissy, dear, put on yer cloak, it's a purty tejus
evenin'. Kier, you tie up yer throat, you know you
was complainin' of a soreness in't to-day&mdash;and you
must be kerful to tie it up when you come hum&mdash;it's
dangerous t'egspose yerself arter singin'&mdash;apt to give
a body the browncritters&mdash;and that's turrible&mdash;you
couldent sing any more if you should git that, you
know. You'd better call for Mirandy and Seliny,
hadent you? Don't be out late.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Crane, draw up to the stove&mdash;you must
be chilly off there. You gwine to the party to Major
Coon's day after to-morrow? S'pose they'll give out
ther invitations to-morrow. Dew go, Mr. Crane, it'll
chirk you up and dew you good to go out into socierty
agin. They say it's to be quite numerous. But I
guess ther won't be no dancin' nor highty tighty

<!-- page 77 -->

dewins. If I thought ther would, I shouldent go myself,
for I don't approve on 'em, and couldent countenance
'em. What do you think Sam Pendergrasses
wife told me? she said how't the widder Jinkins (she
'twas Poll Bingham) is a havin' a new gownd made a
purpose to wear to the party&mdash;one o' these 'ere flambergasted,
blazin' plaid consarns&mdash;with tew awful
wide kaiterin flounces round the skirt! Did you
ever! How reedickilous for a woman o' her age, ain't
it? I s'pose she expects t' astonish the natyves, and
make her market tew, like enough&mdash;well, she's to be
pitied. O, Mr. Crane! I thought I <i>should go off</i> last
night when I see that old critter squeeze up and hook
onto you. How turrible imperdent&mdash;wa'n't it? But
seems to me, I shouldent a felt as if I was obleeged
to went hum with her if I'd a ben in your place, Mr.
Crane. She made a purty speech about me to the
lectur&mdash;I'm a'most ashamed to tell you on't, Mr.
Crane&mdash;but it shows what the critter is. Kier said he
heered her stretch her neck acrost and whisper to old
Green, "Mr. Green, don't you think the Widder Bedott
seems to be wonderfully took up with <i>craniology</i>."
She's the brazin-facedest critter t' ever lived&mdash;it does
beat all&mdash;I never <i>did</i> see her equill&mdash;but it takes all
sorts o' folks to make up the world, you know. What
did I understand you to say, Mr. Crane?&mdash;a few
minnit's conversation with me?&mdash;deary me! Is it any
thing pertickeler, Mr. Crane! O, dear suz! how you

<p>"O NO, Mr. Crane, by no manner o' means, 'tain't a
minnit tew soon for you to begin to talk about
gittin' married agin. I am amazed you should be
afeerd I'd think so. See&mdash;how long's Miss Crane ben
dead? Six months!&mdash;land o' Goshen!&mdash;why I've
know'd a number of individdiwals get married in less
time than that. There's Phil Bennett's widder t' I
was a talkin' about jest now&mdash;she 'twas Louisy Perce
&mdash;her husband hadent been dead but <i>three</i> months,
you know. I don't think it looks well for a <i>woman</i>
to be in such a hurry&mdash;but for a man it's a different
thing&mdash;circumstances alters cases, you know. And
then, sittiwated as you be, Mr. Crane, it's a turrible
thing for your family to be without a head to superintend
the domestic consarns and tend to the children&mdash;to
say nothin' o' yerself, Mr. Crane. You dew need a
companion, and no mistake. Six months! Good
grievous! Why Squire Titus dident wait but <i>six
weeks</i> arter he buried his fust wife afore he married
his second. I thought ther wa'n't no partickler need

<!-- page 80 -->

o' his hurryin' so, seein' his family was all grow'd up.
Such a critter as he pickt out, tew! 'twas very onsuitable&mdash;but
every man to his taste&mdash;I hain't no dispersition
to meddle with nobody's consarns. There's
old farmer Dawson, tew&mdash;his pardner hain't ben dead
but ten months. To be sure he ain't married yet&mdash;but
he would a ben long enough ago if somebody I
know on'd gin him any incurridgement. But 'tain't
for me to speak o' that matter. He's a clever old
critter and as rich as a Jew&mdash;but&mdash;lawful sakes! he's
old enough to be my father.  And there's Mr. Smith&mdash;Jubiter
Smith&mdash;you know him, Mr. Crane&mdash;his wife
(she 'twas Aurory Pike) she died last summer, and
he's ben squintin' round among the wimmin ever
since, and he <i>may</i> squint for all the good it'll dew
him as far as I'm consarned&mdash;tho' Mr. Smith's a respectable
man&mdash;quite young and hain't no family&mdash;very
well off tew, and quite intellectible&mdash;but I tell ye
what&mdash;I'm purty partickler. O, Mr. Crane! it's ten
year come Jinniwary since I witnessed the expiration
o' my belovid companion!&mdash;an oncommon long time
to wait, to be sure&mdash;but 'tain't easy to find any body
to fill the place o' Hezekier Bedott. I think <i>you're</i>
the most like husband of ary individdiwal I ever see,
Mr. Crane. Six months! murderation! curus you
should be afeard I'd think 'twas tew soon&mdash;why I've
know'd&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Mr. Crane.</i>&mdash;"Well widder&mdash;I've been thinking

<!-- page 81 -->

about taking another companion&mdash;and I thought I'd
ask you&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Widow.</i>&mdash;"O, Mr. Crane, egscuse my commotion&mdash;it's
so onexpected. Jest hand me that are bottle o'
camfire off the mantletry shelf&mdash;I'm ruther faint&mdash;dew

to my nuz. There&mdash;that'll dew&mdash;I'm obleeged tew

<p><i>Mr. Crane.</i>&mdash;"Well widder, I was agoing to ask
you whether&mdash;whether&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Widow.</i>&mdash;"Continner, Mr. Crane&mdash;dew&mdash;I know
it's turrible embarrisin'. I remember when my dezeased
husband made his suppositions to me, he stammered
and stuttered, and was so awfully flustered it
did seem as if he'd never git it out in the world, and
I s'pose it's ginerally the case, at least it has been with
all them that's made suppositions to me&mdash;you see
they're ginerally oncerting about what kind of an anser
they're agwine to git, and, it kind o' makes 'em
narvous. But when an individdiwal has reason to
s'pose his attachment's reciperated, I don't see
what need there is o' his bein' flustrated&mdash;tho' I must
say it's quite embarrassin' to me&mdash;pray continner."</p>

<p><i>Widow.</i>&mdash;"The dragon!"</p>

<p><i>Mr, C.</i>&mdash;"I hain't said any thing to her about it yet&mdash;thought

<!-- page 82 -->

the proper way was to get your consent
first. I remember when I courted Trypheny we were
engaged some time before mother Kenipe knew any
thing about it, and when she found it out she was
quite put out because I dident go to her first. So
when I made up my mind about Melissy, thinks me,
I'll dew it right this time and speak to the old woman
first&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Widow.</i>&mdash;"<i>Old woman</i>, hey! that's a purty name
to call me!&mdash;amazin' perlite tew! Want Melissy, hey!
Tribbleation! gracious sakes alive! well, I'll give it
up now! I always know'd you was a simpleton, Tim
Crane, but I <i>must</i> confess I dident think you was <i>quite</i>
so big a fool&mdash;want Melissy, dew ye? If that don't
beat all! What an everlastin' old calf you must be
to s'pose she'd <i>look</i> at <i>you</i>. Why, you're old enough
to be her father, and more tew&mdash;Melissy ain't only in
her twenty-oneth year. What a reedickilous idee for
a man o' your age! as gray as a rat tew! I wonder
what this world <i>is</i> a comin' tew: 'tis astonishin' what
fools old widdiwers will make o' themselves! Have
Melissy! Melissy!"</p>

<p><i>Mr. C.</i>&mdash;"Why, widder, you surprise me&mdash;I'd no
idee of being treated in this way after you'd ben so
polite to me, and made such a fuss over me and the

bizness keepin' me up here so late waitin' for you&mdash;when
I'm eny most tired to death iornin' and workin'
like a slave all day;&mdash;ought to ben abed an hour ago.
Thought ye left me with agreeable company, hey? I
should like to know what arthly reason you had to
s'pose old Crane's was agreeable to me? I always
dispised the critter&mdash;always thought he was a turrible
fool&mdash;and now I'm convinced on't. I'm completely
dizgusted with him&mdash;and I let him know it to-night.
I gin him a piece o' my mind 't I guess he'll be apt to
remember for a spell. I ruther think he went off with
a flea in his ear. Why, cappen&mdash;did ye ever hear o'
such a piece of audacity in all yer born days? for
<i>him</i>&mdash;<i>Tim Crane</i>&mdash;to durst to expire to my hand&mdash;the
widder o' deacon Bedott! jest as if <i>I'd</i> condescen to
look at him&mdash;the old numskull! He don't know B
from broomstick; but if he'd a stayed much longer
I'd a teacht him the difference, I guess. He's got his
<i>walkin' ticket</i> now&mdash;I hope he'll lemme alone in futur.
And where's Kier? Gun home with the Cranes, hey!
well, I guess it's the last time. And now, Melissy
Bedott, you ain't to have nothin' more to dew with
them gals&mdash;d'ye hear? you ain't to sociate with 'em at
all arter this&mdash;'twould only be incurridgin th' old man

round&mdash;d'ye hear? Don't be in a hurry, cappen&mdash;and
don't be alarmed at my gitten' in such passion
about old Crane's persumption. Mabby you think
'twas onfeelin' in me to use him so&mdash;and I don't say
but what 'twas <i>ruther</i>, but then he's so awful dizagreeable
tew me, you know&mdash;'tain't <i>every body</i> I'd treat in

<p>MELISSY! ain't that old uncle Dawson a drivin'
up to Smith's store? Well, I thought so&mdash;I've
seen him round considrable lately&mdash;ben suspectin'
every day he'd be callin' in here&mdash;hain't called sence
his wife died. I met him t'other day and axed him
why he dident come&mdash;said he'd ben very bizzy, but
he'd try to call afore long&mdash;so I guess he's comin' to-day,
he's so spruced up. He's got on a new overcoat,
hain't he? that's the reason I dident know him
at fust. Melissy! spring tew and finish pleetin' on
that are cap border, I want to put it on, this ere's so
dirty I should be ashamed to be ketcht in't. I want
you should set the border furder back, and the bows
a leetle higher up than they be on this ere, so's my face
won't look so narrer, it makes a body look old to have
such a phizmahogany. Here's the ribbin; come, be spry,
I expect every minnit to see him come out o' the store.
You' needent sow it wonderful tight, jest pin them
bows on, don't stop to sow em&mdash;that'll dew. Guess
I'll put on my ally packer gownd, wouldent ye? it's

<!-- page 87 -->

more becomin' than ary other gownd I've got. Hold
your tongue, Melissy&mdash;what bizness is it o' yourn if I
dew set my cap for old Dawson? He's rich as mud
and hain't a chick nor child to leave his fortin' tew.
Univarsaler? I don't bleve a word on't&mdash;he goes to
meetin' quite stiddy lately. I don't care if he is a
Universaler nother, there's good folks in all denominations&mdash;pin
down my collar quick&mdash;he's enough
sight better'n old Crane is with all his sanctimony.
Don't you think it's an improvement settin' the bows
higher up? I tell you what, Melissy Bedott, I should
like a chance to ride over the heads o' some o' these
ere folks that feel so mighty grand, shouldent you?
you <i>shouldent</i>, hey? Well, I spoze ye wouldent&mdash;you'd
jest as leve be put down and trod upon as not&mdash;you're
jest like yer father, he hadent no more sperrit than an
old goose, and you hain't nother. For <i>my</i> part I'd
like to be able to show Miss Coon 't I'm as good as
she is and a leetle grain better, neverstandin' she
dident invite me to her party, the miserable, low-lifed
critter! shall always be glad I dident let you go&mdash;spoze
I couldent pervented Kier's gwine if he'd a felt
able&mdash;shall always be glad he had such a turrible cold
he couldent go. There comes Mr. Dawson! he's
gittin' in his cutter. Why! as true as natur he's
druv up street! wonder where he's gwine! You jest
go to the door and see where he stops&mdash;folks'll talk
if I go, every body's a watchin' me. Well, where did

<!-- page 88 -->

he go? To widder Jinkinses!! land o' liberty! well
I'll give it up now! I'll bet a cookey she called him
in, 'twold be egzackly like her. Well, seein' I'm
drest, I'll just run in to Sam Pendergrasses. I want
to see Miss Pendergrass&mdash;I'll take my knittin', for
mabby I shant be hum to tea. If I should stay there
to tea don't you and Kier be a lettin' into the plum
sass and cake, as you did t'other day when I went to
Deacon Kenipe's. Git some o' them are cold beans in
the cubberd, and the bread 'twas left at dinner, there's
enough on't, don't cut no more&mdash;ye won't want no
butter if ye have beans. And if Mr. Dawson calls,
you come arter me, d'ye hear? [On her return in the
evening she finds Mr. Jupiter Smith visiting Melissa.]
How dew you do, Mr. Smith? Ben here long? I'm
sorry I was out when you came&mdash;glad you stayed 'till
I got back tho'. When did you git home from Varmount?
To-day, hey! How did you find your
parents? So you mist that are all-killin' genteel
party last night? Well, I guess you dident lose much&mdash;'tain't
no credit to nobody to go to such a place.
Sam Pendergrasses wife's ben a tellin' me about it,
she was there, and of all the strains ever I heerd on I
should think that was the cap sheef. Why wa'n't
I there? 'cause I don't sociate with such company as
the Coons. I wa'n't invited, to be sure&mdash;she'd as soon
a thought of invitin' the <i>governor</i> as me. I shouldent
a went a step if had a ben invited&mdash;why, Miss

<!-- page 89 -->

Coon used to be a hired gal in her young days! and
now sence she's got a hyst in the world, she tries to
cut a spludge and make folks think she's a lady&mdash;but
any body that's used to good company, can see
in a minnit that <i>she's</i> no lady. They say the way
she performed last night was a caution. She had a
gret long ostridge feather in her head, and she paraded
round like a grannydear&mdash;bowin' and smilin' and
curchyin' with as much dignitude as if she'd a ben the
queen o' Sheby&mdash;wa'n't it laffable? If I'd a ben
there I know I should a snorted right out in her face.
Old Crane was there tew, pokin' round among the
gals&mdash;mighty partickler to Kesier Winkle, they say.
Did you ever! and his wife hain't ben dead but six
months! ain't it awful? Well, I'm glad I've got rid
o' the critter at last. He's ben stickin' round me ever
since he come here&mdash;and it <i>did</i> seem as if I should go
crazy, he's so terrible disagreeable&mdash;but I gin him a
check on the tow-path t'other day&mdash;and I ruther
guess he'll lemme alone arter this. Kesier Winkle!
ain't it reedickelous? I don't see what he could
fancy about her, do you? ther ain't nothin' of her but
her purty face&mdash;and <i>I</i> never thought that was so awful
handsome as some folks does. Her red cheeks is her
only beauty, and they dew say <i>them</i> ain't natral. But
I don't want to hurt Kesier Winkle&mdash;she's an unoffensive,
simple critter&mdash;I shall pity her if she gits
Tim Crane, he's the meanest of all created critters.

I knowed him in his young days. I mean when he
was <i>ruther</i> young, and I was <i>very</i> young indeed. I
knowed him always till he went to the West&mdash;and
I'd as soon think o' havin' the "old boy" as him.
He don't know nothin' only how to make money&mdash;O
yes he does to&mdash;he knows how to <i>keep</i> it. Of all
stingy mortals he's the stingiest. Husband dispised
him&mdash;used to say, Tim Crane was so tight he fairly
begrudged the air he breathed&mdash;and it's a fact. Massy
tew me! it does seem onaccountable how any body
can be so beset to get married as to take up with him&mdash;don't
it? He's the consarndest old gump tew't
ever was&mdash;no intellectibility at all. I always knowed
he was a dretful ninny, but I <i>dident</i> think he was so
awful silly as he is till t'other night at the Phreenyogical
lectur. He come and sot down by me; I was
turribly provoked to have him a stickin' round me in
public so, but I couldent help it, you know; I was
purty haughty tew him, I tell ye. Well, if you'll
believe it&mdash;as true as I <i>set here</i>&mdash;when the lecterer was
tellin' about the organs in folkses heads, old Crane
thought he meant them are music organs&mdash;it's a fact;
I never was so dizgusted in my life. Well, he ain't
worth talkin' about, and I make it a pint never to talk
about nobody. I eny most wish you had a ben to
that party, Mr. Smith; it must a ben quite entertainin'
to see the dewins. They say the widder Jinkins
made herself perfectly redicklous. She was drest

off like a young gal&mdash;false curls on and artifishel
flowers in her cap.  I think that's very unproper for
a woman o' her age&mdash;why, I never wear 'em, and I
ain't nowhere nigh so old as she is&mdash;'tis amazin! and
they say she cut round and hollered and laffed and
tried to be wonderful interestin'. They say she's a
tryin' to draw in old uncle Dawson; wouldent it be awful
if she should coax him up to marry her? but if she
should, he's a bigger fool than I took him for, that's
all&mdash;what say? <i>is</i> gwine to marry her? why Jubiter
Smith! I don't bleve it&mdash;if 'twas so Sam Pendergrasses
wife would a knowed it&mdash;she knows every
thing that guz on in the place&mdash;though she and Miss
Jinkins ain't very friendly; but I know 'tain't so&mdash;who
told you, Mr. Smith? Miss Jinkins herself!!
land o' Nod!! Next week!! you don't!! well&mdash;I'll
give it up now! The widder Jinkins a gwine to be
married to old, uncle Dawson! If that ain't the last
thing I ever heerd on! What is this world a comin'
tew? How redicklous! well, she's a mean, good-for-nothin',
underhanded critter to go to work a settin'
her traps for that poor old man, and, conduce him to
make such a flumbergasted fool o' himself in his old
age! What a dog's life she'll lead him tew! Why
she's the awfullest tempered critter 'tever was made.
I've knowed Poll Bingham from a gal, and I don't
bleve Bill Jinkins would a turned out such a misrable
shack if he'd a had decent woman for a wife, Poll

<!-- page 92 -->

Jinkins and old Dawson? tribbilation!! Well, she's
been ravin' distracted to git married ever since her
husband died, and arter all, she couldent git nobody
but that poor decripped, superanimated old feller. If
she wa'n't dretful anxious to git marrid she wouldent
take <i>him</i>. Melissy, dear, go down suller and git some
apples&mdash;some o' the seek-no-furders&mdash;don't fall down
and break yer neck, darlin'. Old Dawson! why he's
a Univarsaler! ain't it awful? I'd as soon think o'
havin' a Hoppintot. If that had a ben the <i>only</i> thing
ther was aginst him, <i>I</i> shouldent a had him. I never
gin him no incurridgement&mdash;just as if I were a gwine
to take up with Tom, Dick, and Harry, arter bein' the
wife o' such a man as Deacon Bedott! He's an
amazin' ignorant old coot, tew&mdash;'tis surprisin' how
little he knows! Git some knives and plates, now,
Melissy&mdash;help yourself to apples, Mr. Smith. I can
tell you a circumstance that actilly took place once&mdash;that'll
show you what an ignorant old heathen he is.
His wife used to belong to Parson Potter's church,
and once in a while he used to come to meetin' with
her, and he always used to go to sleep as soon as the
sarmon begun, and sleep till meetin' was out&mdash;well,
one Sabberday old Dawson was to meetin'&mdash;and Parson
Potter preached some doctrinal pint&mdash;I don't now
remember what was the theme of his subject&mdash;but
any way, arter he'd gin out his text, says he,
"Brothrin&mdash;the subject under consideration this

<!-- page 93 -->

mornin' is one o' the biggest importance, and I've
gin it my unmitigated attention for a number o' year&mdash;but
I'm sorry to say, the commontaters don't agree
with me." Well, old Dawson heerd that&mdash;and then
he dropt asleep as usual. The next arternoon Miss
Potter had company&mdash;what's called a "deacon party,"
you know&mdash;that is&mdash;all the deacons and ther wives.
There was Deacon Kenipe and his wife, Deacon Crosby
and his wife, Deacon Whipple and his wife, and Deacon
Bedott and me. Well, as we was all a settin' there
about the middle o' the arternoon, who should come
in but old uncle Dawson, luggin' a mortal gret sass-basket&mdash;"Well
Parson," says he, "you said yesterday
in meetin' how't the <i>common taters</i> dident agree with
ye&mdash;so I've fetched you some <i>oncommon</i> ones&mdash;the
very best that ever was growd&mdash;for I reckoned 'twas
tew bad you should be obleeged to live on common,
poor taters, while I had such a bundance o' good uns.
It's a kind I fetcht from Connecticut&mdash;where I used
to live&mdash;nobody round here hain't got nun like em.
They call em "Harrington blue-skins"&mdash;you needent
be afeared but what they'll agree with ye&mdash;ye might
eat em all day, and not feel a grain the woss for't."</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Smith, that's a fact&mdash;I was knowin' to't&mdash;Parson
Potter, he thankt him over and over agin&mdash;and
we all contrived to keep our faces strait till he'd
got out o' the house&mdash;and then, what a roarin' ther
was! Parson Potter told us never to mention it in

<!-- page 94 -->

creation&mdash;cause the old man meant well&mdash;but some
how or other it got out&mdash;such things will, you know.
But, as Deacon Whipple remarked&mdash;it's lamentyble
that any body in this free and inlightened kintry
should be so blind and ignorant. But he's good
enough for widder Jinkins any day&mdash;don't you say
so? Well, what <i>is</i> Wiggletown a comin' tew? Poll
Jinkins and old uncle Dawson! it's the laffablest
thing I've heerd on this many a day! he, he, he! I
shall go off!!</p>

<br/>

<p>The last news that I had from Wiggletown, was
that Melissa is soon to be married to the worthy Mr.
Jupiter Smith; and that Kier is engaged to Selina
Crane. It is supposed that the widow never would
have given her consent to these matches, had it not
been for the interference of Mr. and Mrs. Magwire,
who have at last induced her to give up her opposition
to the wishes of her children. She, however, continues
to growl about it occasionally, and has become
perfectly "<i>dizgusted</i>" with Wiggletown and every body
in it, declaring, that "it ain't what it used to be&mdash;all
run down&mdash;not fit for respectable people to live in&mdash;and
she don't mean to have nothin' to dew with nobody
in a place where every body's atryin' to injure
her, and put her down&mdash;and so."</p>

<h3>The Widow Resolves to Leave Wiggletown.</h3>

</div>

<p>THE Widow Bedott having resolved to leave
Wiggletown, makes her farewell visit to her
friend Mrs. Higgins, of Ganderfield.</p>

<p>"Did ye know I was a gwine to quit Wiggletown?
dident hay? Well I be&mdash;I lay out to go next week.
I am gwine to Scrabble Hill, to sister Magwire's, to
spend the winter, at least&mdash;and if I like it purty well,
mabby I shall conclude to make it my native place
and never come back to Wiggletown&mdash;without 'tis
jest a visitin'. It's turrible lonesome to be keepin'
house all alone as I be now since Kier and Melissy
was married and dewin' for themselves. Ary one
on 'em would be glad to have me live with 'em&mdash;but
some how I don't like the idee. Melissy's
got a nice man for a husband. Jubiter Smith's a very
nice man&mdash;and she's very pleasantly sitiwated. But
I'd ruther not live with 'em&mdash;shouldent feel independent,
ye know. And as for livin' to Kier's&mdash;I
guess it'll be <i>after this</i>, any how, afore I dew that.
Seliny's well enough, fur as I know. I hain't nothin'

<!-- page 96 -->

against Seliny&mdash;only I don't like that <i>stock</i>. I was
opposed to Kier's marryin' into that family&mdash;but he
was so determined on't I gin up my opposition and
tried to make the best on't. But I can't be intirely
reconciled to't, dew what I will. It's werry onpleasant
to be connected with that tribe, any way. Especially
the old man&mdash;I never could bear Tim Crane&mdash;he's
so mortal mean. Dident know it? well, then,
you don't know him as well as I dew. Why I've
been acquainted with him ever sence he was quite a
young man, and I can testify 't he was always as tight
as a drum-head. How else did he make his money,
pray? he never could a did it by his <i>wits</i>, for he hain't
none. Yes&mdash;I always knowd Tim Crane&mdash;so did my
poor husband&mdash;he used to have dealins with him, and
<i>he</i> said, that of all born skin-flints 'tever he had to do
with, Tim Crane was the biggest. Yes&mdash;I always
dispised the critter&mdash;and then to think that any body
should say 't I was a tryin' to ketch him!&mdash;'tis scandicilous!
Hain't heerd nobody say so? Well thir
<i>is</i> such a story all round Wiggletown&mdash;and I guess
I know who started it, tew&mdash;and that was old Dawson's
wife&mdash;she 'twas widder Jinkins&mdash;she's always a
runnin' me down&mdash;and she feels oncommon ryled up
against me now cause she knows the old man was
arter me 'fore he took her. I know she started the
story, cause Sam Pendegrasses wife told me on't&mdash;and
she said she heerd it from Minervy Hawley&mdash;and

<!-- page 97 -->

Minervy Hawley heerd it from Major Coon's wife&mdash;and
Major Coon's wife and Miss Dawson is wonderful
intimit&mdash;and I s'pose Miss Dawson told Miss Coon.
But what she says ain't worth mindin'. 'Tis curus't
nobody should pay any attention to't. <i>Me</i> set my
cap for old Crane! Gracious! I never could bear the
sight of him. I tell you, I was glad enough when he
got married to Kesier Winkle&mdash;though <i>'twas</i> a most
reedicilous piece o' business, wa'n't it? To think o'
his marryin' that foolish flirt of a gal! young enough
to be his darter, tew! But I rejoiced from the bottom
o' my heart when it took place&mdash;for, thinks me, folks'll
stop ther gab about him and me now. You see, he'd
been stickin' round me ever sence he came back here&mdash;and
ther was considerable talk that him and me
was a gwine to make a match&mdash;and 'twas very distressin'
to me to be the subjick of such a report. I
done all in my power to give him to understand that
his attentions was dizagreeable tew me&mdash;but somehow
another he wouldent take the hint. I dident want
him to offer himself tew me, you know. I always
make it a pint when I see't an individdiwal's pleased
with me and I don't recipperate ther sentiments&mdash;I
say, I always make it a pint to disencourage 'em all
I can&mdash;for it hurts my feelins amazinly to be obleeged
to refuse a man; it's so mortifyin' tew 'em, ye know,
to be told they ain't wanted. I always git rid on't
when I can&mdash;and I tried tew in this case&mdash;but the old

<!-- page 98 -->

coot was so awful numbheaded I couldent beat any
thin' into him. He hung on like the toothache&mdash;till
I got out of all patience. At last he come t' our house
one evening&mdash;(Now Miss Higgins, I hope you won't
never mention this to nobody. I shouldent a told you
on't&mdash;I make it a pint never to tell o' such things.
Only seein' we was a speakin' o' the story bein' round
that I sot my cap for him, I thought I'd let you know
how much foundation ther was for't&mdash;but don't let it
git no furder for pity's sake. I don't wish Mr. Crane
no harm). But I was a gwine to tell ye&mdash;He took
the opportunity one night when I was alone, to come
over t' our house. I ginerally contrived to keep
Melissy or Keir in the room when he came there; and
I 'spose he'd noticed it, for he come over a singin'
school evenin', when he knowd they'd be gone. I tell
ye I was mad when I see the critter come in. I
treated him as cool as a cowcumber; but neverstandin'
all that, if you'll bleve it, he up and popped the question!
At first I answered him as civil as I could, and
begged to be egscused; but he wouldent take <i>no</i> for
an answer; and so I was obleeged to be purty hash
with him and told him I dident want nothing to dew
with him, and wished he'd reitterate and leave me
alone and never trouble me no more. And will ye
bleve it! the critter continued to bang on till I was
necessiated to order him out o' the house and tell him
if ever be darkened my doors agin he'd ketch it. So

<!-- page 99 -->

at last I got rid of him; and that's the upshot o' the
matter betwixt old Crane and me. 'Twas about tew
months afore he was married to Kesier Winkle&mdash;and
<i>disappinted me</i>, as they say. Disappinted! it looks
like bein' disappinted, don't it? It's awful provokin'
to be talked about as I be, ain't it? But I've always
ben the subjick o' slander ever since I lived here, and
that's since I was quite a gal. What a turrible place
for talkin', Wiggletown is, though! a regular slander
mill. It's a great deal woss than it used be&mdash;and
'twas always bad enough. I'm perfectly dizgusted
with the place, expecially sence them stories about old
Crane and me. It makes me outrageous to be lied
about so by such folks as old Dawson's wife and Miss
Major Coon. Miss Coon&mdash;she don't like me cause I
hain't never knuckled tew her. You know she thinks
she's a great character sence she married Major Coon.
But I can tell her "I ain't so fond o' pork as to eat hog-yokes!"
Miss Pendergrass says, I hadent ought to
mind none o' the stories folks tells&mdash;and I don't mean
tew. But then it's made me clear sick and tired o'
Wiggletown. I'm completely dizgusted with it, and
don't mean to live there no longer if I can help it.
I've ben some time considerin' what's best to dew,
and I've made up my mind to go to Scrabble Hill to
spend the winter with sister Magwire. I was there
and stayed a fortnight about two year ago&mdash;had a very
pleasant visit. At first I thought quite strong o' visitin'

<!-- page 100 -->

my brother, Christopher Columbus Poole, away in
Varmount&mdash;never was there but once, and that was
fore husband died. But I've giv't up on account o'
the family bein' Baptists. I can't stan the Baptists no
way; and if I went there I should have to go to the
Baptist meetin' and that would be a turrible cross tew
me; so I've concluded to go to Scrabble Hill for a
spell. Sister Magwire's a fine woman, though she
ain't very intellectible. I always sot a great deal by
her. No doubt she'll be wonderful glad to have me
come. She must be considerable lonesome now. Her
only son's gone off to study doctrin; and she's alone
quite a good deal. Her husband carries on the shoe-makin'
bisness quite extensive; and he's to his shop
the heft o' the time. To speak the truth, I ain't sorry
her son's gone, for he ain't no favoryte o' mine. He's
growed up to be rather a dizagreeable young man&mdash;always
pokin' fun at every body. He takes after his
father in that respect. Brother Magwire's quite a
teaze, though he knows better'n to hurt folk's feelins
as Jeff does. I think I shall enjoy myself pretty
well at Scrabble Hill. The society is quite refined
there, and that suits me, ye know. I feel out o' place
in Wiggletown; ther ain't no refinement there at all.
What little there used to be's all run out. The inhabiters
now's a perfect set o' Goffs and Randals.
I'm thoroughly dizgusted with the hull town and
every body in it, exceptin' Kier and Melissy, and Sam

Wiggletown might go to destruction for all I'd

<p>LETTER FROM JEFFERSON MAGUIRE TO HIS COUSIN,
MRS. JASPER DOOLITTLE.</p>

<p>COONVILLE, Oct. 27, 1847.</p>

<p>DEAR COUSIN NANCY:</p>

<p>What gloomy, miserable weather this is! But I
suppose that your domestic cares and your good husband,
occupy so much of your attention, that you've
hardly time to growl about the weather. I assure
you I feel forlorn enough to-day. Probably more so,
for having just returned from a visit of a week at
father's; and home is so much pleasanter to me than
any other place, that I am always discontented for a
while after coming away.</p>

<p>I suppose you would like to know what the good
folks at Scrabble Hill are doing; so I'll tell you as
far as I know. Father and mother get on about after
the old sort, and there seems to be no great change
among the other inhabitants. Sam Baily is paying
attention to Katy Carey, and Pardon Hittibone and
Maria Louisa Wilson are to be married next month.
Charity Grimes and Sally Hugle are as <i>old</i> and as disagreeable
as ever, if not a <i>leetle</i> more so, and full as
anxious to dispose of themselves as ever. Old Elder

<!-- page 102 -->

Sniffles, the Baptist minister, lost his wife about two
months ago, and his personal appearance has greatly
improved since that afflictive event (no uncommon
thing as respects widowers, I believe). The Footes have
sold out, and gone to Wisconsin, and&mdash;well I believe,
you have now all the village news, excepting one
piece of information, and that, as it is the most important,
I have reserved till the last. A distinguished
stranger arrived at Scrabble Hill some two weeks
since. Who do you guess it is? Why, no less a
personage than the Widow Bedott, interesting relict
of Deacon Hezekiah Bedott. She has actually inflicted
herself upon father's folks for the whole winter.
What a time they'll have of it, won't they? Mother
is so well disposed, that she tries to put up with it
cheerfully; but nevertheless, it is pretty evident that
she looks upon Aunt Bedott as a prodigious bore.
She had been there but two or three days when I
went home, and she did not appear overjoyed to see
me. For some reason or other she doesn't take a
particular fancy to me. Mother says it's because I
teaze her sometimes. But there is something so <i>decidedly
rich</i> about Aunt Silly, that I can not for my life
help having a little fun at her expense occasionally.
On Sunday morning I said to her, when mother wasn't
by, "Well, aunty, where do you go to meeting to-day?"
"Where do I go to meetin'!" said she "what
a question! why, where should I go but to my own

<!-- page 103 -->

meetin'?" "Oh," said I, "I thought perhaps you'd
like to hear Elder Sniffles, he's such an interesting
preacher," "What!" said she, "me go to the Baptist
meetin'! I hope you ain't in arnest, Jeff; why I'd as
soon go to the theater as go there. I have a sufferin'
contempt for the Baptists. They think nobody can't
git to heaven without bein' dipped, dippin's a savin'
audience with them. Why, come to think, I remember
that Elder Sniffles. When I was here afore, yer
mother and me was in to Mr. Hugle's one evenin'&mdash;they're
Baptists ain't they? and Elder Sniffles
and his wife come in there to call. If my memory
serves me, he's ruther a tall, scrawny man, with eyes
that looks like a couple o' peeled onions, and kind o'
squintin' tew, and seems to me he hadn't no hair
hardly." "O!" said I, "you'd scarcely know him
now, he's got a wig and wears spectacles, which improves
his appearance vastly." "Well, I should think
it needed improvin'," said she.</p>

<p>"By the way, aunty," said I, "did you know that
Mrs. Sniffles was dead?" "You don't say so!" said
she. "Yes," said I: "she died only a few weeks ago.
I feel sorry for the elder&mdash;he must be so lonesome."
"So do I," said she, with a sigh. "It's a dredful
thing to lose a companion, and I s'pose the Baptists
feel it as much as anybody." "Undoubtedly," said
I; "Elder Sniffles seems deeply afflicted&mdash;his sermons,
they say have been more interesting than ever, since

<!-- page 104 -->

his loss: something mournfully solemn about them."&mdash;so
I went on for some time, dilating upon the elder's
eloquence and talents, and loneliness and all that. I assure
you I talked pretty fast, for fear mother'd come in
before I could say all I wanted to&mdash;and I was afraid
she'd throw all the fat in the fire. At length aunt
Silly said that I'd raised her curiosity to such a pitch
that she really felt quite a desire to hear the elder preach&mdash;she
had a good notion to go to the Baptist meeting
for once. Of course I offered my services as escort.
Shortly after mother came in, and was quite surprised
when Aunt Bedott announced her intention of:
going to the Baptist meeting. "What's your notion?"
said mother. "Oh!" said aunty, "Jeff's excited my
curiosity so much about Elder Sniffles, that I feel as
if I'd like to go and hear him preach." Mother looked
at me for an explanation&mdash;so I thought my best course
was to own up&mdash;for I knew that mother wouldn't expose
me, and tell Aunt Bedott that I was hoaxing
her, as it would serve to increase her antipathy to me,
which mother was anxious to do away. Therefore, I
remarked that I'd been telling aunt Silly what an eloquent
man elder Sniffles was. Mother said nothing
then, but as soon as we were alone, she took me to task
roundly. However I carried the point, and aunty and
I went off to the Baptist meeting. We had a seat very
near the pulpit. As usual, the elder whaled away
through his nose&mdash;thumped the desk, and went over

<!-- page 105 -->

and over again with the same thing&mdash;using a little different
words each time, without ever making the most
remote approach to any thing like the shadow of an
idea. But it would have done you good to see with
what devout and earnest attention Aunt Bedott regarded
him all the time. Once she was deeply affected,
and sobbed in a manner that attracted universal attention.
It was on his making the very <i>original</i> observation
that "this was a changing world, and we couldn't
calculate with any degree of certainty upon any
thing!" When we were going home, Aunt Bedott
said&mdash;"Well, Jefferson you was right&mdash;elder Sniffles
is a very interesting preacher&mdash;very, indeed. I never
was more edified in my life than I've been this mornin'.
He ain't so bad <i>lookin</i>', nother, as I was thinkin'
he was: that ere wig makes him look ten year younger&mdash;a
body never'd think o' such a thing as its bein'
a wig&mdash;it's so natral. And them specs, too: they're
an improvement on account o' kind o' hidin' the pecooliarities
of his eyes. I don't know as I should a'
took him for the same indiwiddiwal. But then his
sarmon!&mdash;Oh, Jefferson, that was what I call a <i>sarmon</i>
in arnest! I begin to think 'tain't right to be so
prejudiced against other denominations. I should
like to be introduced to Elder Sniffles, and hear him
convarse." Wouldn't it be <i>rich</i>, Nancy, to be an invisible
listener to the conversation? The next day I
came away. I shall be quite curious to know whether

<!-- page 106 -->

Aunt Bedott continues in her liberal frame of mind&mdash;but
I sha'n't dare to ask mother a word about it when
I write&mdash;so I must remain in ignorance until I go
home again at Thanksgiving. But I'm writing a
tremendously long letter, so I'll just stop where I am.
Remember me to cousin Jasper, and believe me your
affectionate cousin.</p>

<p>"I think I may confidentially say I hev."</p>

<p>"How long sence?"</p>

<p>"Wal, about a year and a half. I experienced religion
over in Varmount, at one o' brother Armstrong's
protracted meetin's. I tell ye, Widder, them special
efforts is great things&mdash;ever sence I <i>come out</i> I've felt
like a new critter."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope you've <i>acted</i> like one, and restored

<!-- page 109 -->

four-fold, as scripter commands, to them you've got
the better of. If ye did I guess yer pockets was
cleaned out amazin' quick."</p>

<p>"I'm free to say, I hev made restitution as fur as I
was able."</p>

<p>"Well, then, ye'd better hand over that dollar I paid
for them shoes&mdash;or at least six shillin' on't, they
wa'n't worth over twenty-five cents at the furdest."</p>

<p>"Wal, I'll tell ye Widder how I ginerally dew in
such cases. I make a practice o' lettin' on 'em <i>trade</i>
it out [he begins to open his boxes], I've got a lot o'
goods that'll make yer eyes water, I guess. I make
it a pint o' carryin' a finer stock than ary other travelin'
merchant in this section."</p>

<p>"Ye needent undew 'em&mdash;I hain't no notion o'
tradin'."</p>

<p>"But 'twon't cost nothin' to jest look at 'em, ye
know&mdash;there, them pocket handkerchers is superior
to any thing ye'll find this side o' New York."</p>

<p>"Wonderful thin though."</p>

<p>"Sheer, ye mean, that's what they call sheer, a
very desirable quality in linning cambrick. I tell ye
Widder there ain't no such handkerchers in Scrabble
Hill."</p>

<p>"I'll bet a cent they're half cotton."</p>

<p>"Half cotton! jingo! they ain't half cotton&mdash;I'll
stake my repertation on't&mdash;I mean my present repertation."</p>

<!-- page 110 -->

<p>"What dew ye ax for 'em?"</p>

<p>"Wal, them handkerchers had orto fetch twelve
shillin' apiece. I never sold none for less, but bein'
as I dident dew exactly the fair thing about the shoes,
if ye'll take a couple I'll strike off tew shillin', and
let ye hev 'em for tew dollars and seventy-five
cents."</p>

<p>"Land o' liberty! ye scare me, Jabe! I'm wantin'
some nice handkerchers wonderfully <i>jest now</i>, but dear
me! I'd go without to the eend o' my days afore I'd
pay such a price for 'em."</p>

<p>"Wal, then, say tew dollars fifty cents, I'm willin'
to let 'em go for that considerin' the shoes."</p>

<p>"Twenty shillin'! it's awful high, I won't give it."

<p>"Say eighteen shillin' then, nobody could ax less
than that, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Eighteen shillin'! it's tew much&mdash;I can't afford
it."</p>

<p>"Tew dollars then&mdash;take 'em for tew dollars&mdash;it's
the same as givin' on 'em away. I tell ye Widder, ye
wouldent git such a chance if 'twa'n't for my feelin's
in relation to them shoes. I told ye they was worth
twelve shillin' apiece, and now I offer 'em tew ye for
tew dollars a pair, one dollar struck off, that's all
ye paid for the shoes."</p>

<p>"I never gi'n so much for handkerchers in all my
born days, can't ye take no less?"</p>

<p>"Not a cent Widder, not a cent."</p>

<!-- page 111 -->

<p>"Well, then, I don't feel as if I could afford to take
'em."</p>

<p>"And so I s'pose I may as well put 'em up agin&mdash;wal,
I'm sorry, not that it would be any objict to
me to let them go so cheap, only I thought I'd like
to set my mind at rest about the matter o' the shoes.
I've offered to make it up and you've refused to
have it made up, so the fault is yourn, not mine, my
conscience is clear; if folks will persirt in stannin' in
their own light I can't help it, that's all." [He replaces
them in the box.]</p>

<p>"Lemme jest look at 'em once more, Jabe&mdash;these <i>is</i>
purty&mdash;<i>can't</i> take no less than tew dollars?"</p>

<p>"Not a red cent less; and I tell ye agin it's the
same as givin' on 'em away at that."</p>

<p>"Sure they ain't half cotton?"</p>

<p>"Jest as sure as I be that my name's Jabez
Clark."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I guess I shall hev to take 'em."</p>

<p>"I'm glad on't for <i>your</i> sake&mdash;as I said afore, t'ain't
no objict to me. I've got a piece o' silk I want to
show ye, Miss Bedott, a very desirable article for a
weddin' dress."</p>

<p>"Lawful sakes! I hope ye don't think <i>I</i> want such
a thing."</p>

<p>"Wal, folks tells singular stories. I heerd something
down here."</p>

<p>"O shaw! 'twon't dew to believe all ye hear."

<!-- page 112 -->

<p>"I sold Elder Sniffles a black satting stock and a
buzzom pin yesterday; s'pose he wanted 'em for a
<i>particklar occasion</i>."</p>

<p>"Git out Jabe! what sort of a buzzom pin was it?"</p>

<p>"Wal, 'twas a very desirable pin; topiz sot in gold.
I sold it tew him for a'most nothing. I always make
it a pint to accommodate the clergy in that way, never
charge 'em full price. I always lookt upon the Elder
as a very gifted man&mdash;I staid here over the Sabbath
once to hear him preach&mdash;I tell ye, Widder, 'twas
powerful pleadin'. I'm rather inclined to the Baptist
order myself&mdash;ben quaverin' on the subjict ever sence
I was brought out&mdash;in fact I've thought hard o' givin'
up the travelin' marcantile business and studyin' deology;
but, on the hull, I've about gi'n it up&mdash;'twouldent
do for me to be confined to preachin'&mdash;my health
requires such amount of exercise. But here's that
silk, did ye ever see the beat on't? now that's what
I call <i>splendid</i>&mdash;it's ginniwine French&mdash;they call it
'grody&mdash;grody&mdash;grody'&mdash;what the dogs&mdash;them
French names is so consarnid hard to remember&mdash;O,
I know now, 'grody flewry;' jest take a realizin'
sense o' the colors&mdash;how elegant them stripes is shaded
off, green and yaller and purple, reglar French trycolor,
as they call it."</p>

<p>"It's slazy though, ther ain't much heft to't."</p>

<p>"Heft! to be sure 'tain't heavy, but heavy silks
ain't worn no more, ye know; they're all out o' fashion&mdash;these

<!-- page 113 -->

ere light French silks is all the go now&mdash;ye
see folks has found out how much more durable
they be than the heavy ones&mdash;them's so apt to crack&mdash;why
one o' these ere'll outlast a dozen on 'em.
I've got jest a pattern on't left&mdash;had a hull piece&mdash;sold
tew dresses off on't, one to Judge Hogobome's
daughter in Greenbush, and the other to the Reverend
Dr. Fogo's wife in Albany. Now Widder what do ye
say to takin' that, 'twould make a most hyastical weddin'
dress."</p>

<p>"Well, 'tain't for me so say I'm wantin' such an
article&mdash;but s'posen I was&mdash;I've got a new one that'll
dew. Sister Magwire pickt it out for me. She hain't
got much taste about colors&mdash;but she's a good judge
of quality."</p>

<p>"Got it made up!"</p>

<p>"No; but the mant-maker's a comin' to morrer to
make it."</p>

<p>"Lemme see it, if ye please. I want to compare it
with this." [She brings it.] "Jingo!&mdash;I'll be darned
if 'tain't stun-color! the fag end of <i>all</i> colors!
Why, a body'd think 'twas some everlastin' old maid
instid of a handsome young widder that had chose
such a distressid thing for a weddin' dress."</p>

<p>"Lawful sakes! I dident say 'twas a weddin' dress&mdash;and
I dident say I chose it myself: for, to tell the
truth, I dident more 'n half like it: but sister Magwire
stuck to 'twas more suitable than ary other color&mdash;and

<!-- page 114 -->

then tew, she thought 'twas such an amazin' good
piece."</p>

<p>"Good piece! Jingo! what did ye pay for't?"</p>

<p>"A dollar a yard. Ther's twelve yards on't&mdash;got
it o' Parker and Pettibone, and they said 'twas fustrate."</p>

<p>"Wal, I don't s'pose <i>they</i> meant to cheat ye&mdash;they got
cheated themselves when they bought that silk. I always
know'd that Parker and Pettibone warn't no
judges o' goods. The fact is, them New York marchants
puts off their old onsailable articles onto 'em,
and make 'em think they're ginteel and desirable. I
tell ye, Widder, ye got most consarnedly took in when
ye bought that silk. Ye won't wear it three times afore
it'll crack out at the elbows, and fray out round the
bottom."</p>

<p>"Well, I hain't ben suited with it none o' the time&mdash;shouldent
a got it if sister Magwire hadent a ding-dong'd
me into't. Ther was a blue one ther't I liked
a great deal better."</p>

<p>"I tell ye, Widder, it raly hurts my feelins to think
o' your standin' up along side of Elder Sniffles with
such a consumid lookin' thing on."</p>

<p>"O shaw!&mdash;stop yer hectorin' about the Elder. I
ain't obleeged to hev every body that's after me."</p>

<p>"Wal, I know that&mdash;only such chances as Elder
Sniffles ain't to be sneezed at, ye know. But speakin'
o' that silk&mdash;if 'twa'n't for standin' in my own light

<!-- page 115 -->

so consarnidly, I'll be darned if I wouldent offer to
swop for a small matter o' boot."</p>

<p>"Boot! that's wuss than the shoes! S'pose I'd go
to givin' boot to git rid on't after payin' an awful
sight o' money for't in the fust place?"</p>

<p>"Wal, 'twould be ruther aggravatin' if you'd got
a full pattern&mdash;you hain't but twelve yards. Of course
ye dident calkilate to hev no trimmin', or ye'd a got
more."</p>

<p>"I thought I shouldent trim it considerin'&mdash;"

<p>"Yes, I understand&mdash;considerin' 'twas for a minister's
wife&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Git out, Jabe&mdash;I dident say so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I tell ye, Widder, you're tew partickler&mdash;minister's
wives is as dressy as any body. The Reverend Doctor
Fogo's wife had hern made up with three wide cross-grained
pieces round the skirt. Jingo! they sot it off
slick. These ere stripid silks look fust rate with cross-grain
trimmin'&mdash;seems to go windin' round and round,
and looks so graceful kinder. I seen lots on 'em in the
city. How them city ladies would larf at such a
dress as yourn! But out here in the country folks
don't know nothin'."</p>

<p>"If I'd a trusted to my own taste, I shouldent a
got it. I wish to massy I hadent a ben governed by
sister Magwire."</p>

<p>"Jingo! wouldent it be quite an idee for you to be
the fust in Scrabble Hill to come out in a 'grody flewry.'

<!-- page 116 -->

Them colors would be wonderful becomin' to you.
Jest lemme hold it up to ye and you stan' up and look
in the glass. Jingo! it's becominer than I thought
't would be. I tell ye Widder, you must <i>hev</i> that silk,
and no mistake."</p>

<p>"Dear me! I wish I could afford to swop&mdash;What's
it woth?"</p>

<p>"Wal, I can't expect to git the full vally on't. I'll
sell it tew ye as low as I feel as if I could&mdash;it's a
high-priced silk&mdash;bein' as it's so fashionable now;
but I'll tell <i>you</i>, Miss Bedott&mdash;though I wouldent tell
every body&mdash;the fact is, I got that silk at a bargin,
and of course I can afford to let it go for considerable
less than I could if I'd a paid full price. Ye see the
marchant I took it of was on the pint o' failin', and
glad to sell out for any money. He dident ax but a
dollar a yard.&mdash;Ther's fourteen yards left, as you can
see by the folds&mdash;and you may hev it for fourteen dollars,
jest what it cost me. I tell ye, widder, it's a
bargin."</p>

<p>"Land o' liberty! fourteen dollars! I can't think
on't."</p>

<p>"Wal, then, I'll dew still better by ye. I want
you should hev this silk&mdash;so s'pozen I take yourn off
yer hands, and you take this, and jest pay me the balance.
Mabby I could sell that to some distressid old
quaker woman that wants an every-day frock&mdash;and
what if couldent, I should hev the satisfaction o'

Various Topics.</h3>

</div>

<p>"I SAY, sister Magwire&mdash;this ere's a miserable mean
kind of a world, for I've&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't agree with you, Silly. I think it's a very
good sort of a world if a body looks at in a right
point o' view. Most o' folks in it used <i>me</i> well, and I
guess they'll continner to dew so as long as I use <i>them</i>
well. For my part I'm satisfied with the world ginerally
speakin."</p>

<p>"Well, s'pozen ye be, that's no sign 'tevery body
else had ought to be satisfied with it. You was always
a wonderful satisfied critter. You think every
body's dretful nice and dretful clever."</p>

<p>"Now sister Bedott you <i>know</i> that ain't so&mdash;you
know ther's some folks 't I've got a turrible mean
opinion of."</p>

<p>"I know ther <i>is</i> a few 't ye don't like&mdash;but I mean
as a gineral thing you seem to think the most o' folks
is jest about right. For my part, I'd ruther see things

<!-- page 120 -->

as they actilly be. I shouldent want to be so <i>awful</i>
contented."</p>

<p>"I should think so&mdash;for you ain't never contented
only when you've got some thing to be <i>discontented</i>
about."</p>

<p>"Well, if that's the case, I'd ought to be contented
the heft o' the time, for my trouble is continniwal."</p>

<p>"How you talk, sister Bedott! I thought you hadent
nothing to complain of now-a-days. I know't
along after your husband died you wus in ruther poor
circumstances and used to grumble a good deal&mdash;but
seems to me you'd ought to be contented and thankful
now. Yer children's growd up to be blessins tew
ye, and now they're both settled and dewin fust rate.
And sence father was took away, and the property
was divided, you've had enough to keep ye comfortable,
and more tew."</p>

<p>"O lawful sakes! I dident mean't I was <i>poverty
struck</i>. Ther's other kinds o' trouble besides <i>that</i>&mdash;ain't
thar? If you'd a ben in Wiggletown durin' the
last few years, and seen how every body was a peckin'
at me, and a tryin' to put me down, you'd a thought
I had <i>somethin'</i> to try me. You wouldent jaw me for
thinkin' the world's a dretful mean place&mdash;full o'
dretful queer folks."</p>

<p>"O dear suz! Some folks is always a talkin' about
other folks' bein' queer, while, like enough, it's themselves
that's queer, after all."</p>

<!-- page 121 -->

<p>"I hope ye don't mean to insinniwate 't <i>I'm</i> queer,
Melissy."</p>

<p>"O no, Silly. I dident mean to insinniwate <i>that</i>&mdash;but
then ye know almost every body has ther queer
streaks."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I know it's a pecooliarity natral to every
body to be queer about <i>some</i> things&mdash;but then some
folks <i>is</i> queerer 'n others."</p>

<p>"Jest so, Silly&mdash;some folks is <i>actilly</i> queer&mdash;and
some folks <i>thinks</i> some other folks queer 'cause they
don't happen to think jist as they dew on some pints.
We think some indiwiddiwals is queer cause they
differ from us, and mabbe they think <i>we're</i> queer
cause we differ from <i>them</i>. We'd ought to be carful
how we call other folks queer, for the fact is we're all
queer more or less&mdash;and them that lives in glass
houses mustent throw stuns."</p>

<p>"I wa'n't a throwin' stuns as I know on when I said
'twas a queer world&mdash;for 'tis&mdash;specially that part on't
called Wiggletown. Scrabble Hill don't seem to be
such a sort of a place at all, as fur as I'm able to judge.
I think the inhabbiters is quite intellectible, as a gineral
thing&mdash;and oncommon perlite, tew. I'm quite
pleased with the Scrabble Hill folks. There's Dr.
Lippincott&mdash;he's quite a science man, I should think,
from the way he talks."</p>

<p>"Mabbe he is&mdash;can't say&mdash;for I can't understand
much o' what he says, he talks so big."</p>

<!-- page 122 -->

<p>"I shouldent wonder if <i>you</i> couldent&mdash;but that ain't
no sign nobody can't. I was quite pleased with him,
and his wife, tew&mdash;they seemed so friendly&mdash;took <i>such</i>
an interest in my health, and was so consarned about
my cough that night they called on me."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I guess they've got an idee your a rich widder,
livin' on the interest o' yer money&mdash;husband says
ther's such a story 'round&mdash;shouldent wonder if husband
started it himself, jist to see what would be the
effect on't."</p>

<p>"I shouldent nother, he's so full o' mischief&mdash;but
you don't s'pose that's what makes the Peabodys, and
the Buels, and the Fusticks, and the Hugles so perlite
tew me, dew ye?"</p>

<p>"O I ain't no rite to say 'tis&mdash;I'm sure I'm glad
they're so attentive&mdash;it'll make yer visit pleasanter."</p>

<p>"Jest so&mdash;seems to me Miss Deacon Fustick's a
sing'lar woman&mdash;she seems to be intirely took up with
the 'anti-tea-and-coffee society'&mdash;talked to me all the
time she was here about it&mdash;said I might depend on't
that all that made me so thin, and have such a cough,
was drinkin' tea and coffee. If she runs me so every
time I see her I guess I shall keep clear on her&mdash;for I
won't give up my tea and coffee for her nor nobody
else."</p>

<p>"O lawful sakes! Ye needent be afeard o' that&mdash;she'll
be on to something new afore long. She takes
up every thing that comes along, and gits all engaged

<!-- page 123 -->

about it. A spell ago she was wide awake against
Sabbath-breakin', and dident talk about nothin' else&mdash;then
'twas moral reform&mdash;next come Millerism&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now that makes me think of old mother Green
in Wiggletown. You remember old Jabe Green's
wife!&mdash;she was always jest so carried away with every
new thing, ye know. Tew or three years ago, when
Millerism was makin' such a noise, ther was a feller
along lecturin' about it&mdash;and a number o' the Wiggletown
folks raly thought ther was something in it. But
old Miss Green was clear killed up with it. She give
up all bizness, and dident dew nothin' but traipse
round from house to house a takin' on about the eend
o' the world&mdash;'twas a comin' afore long. Well&mdash;one
day she come into Sam Pendergrasses&mdash;'twas afore
old Miss Pendergrass, Sam's mother, died. She was
a livin' with 'em&mdash;and ye know she was a woman
that always minded her own bizness. Well&mdash;she sot
ther at her loom a weavin' away&mdash;she was a great
hand to weave, the old lady was. Sam's wife was a
settin' there tew&mdash;'twas Sam's wife told me about it.
Well&mdash;Miss Green she sot down in the rockin' cheer,
with her face half a yard long, an she hauled out her
snuff-box (she was an all-to-pieces snuff-taker ye know)
and she begun to snuff and rock, and rock and snuff,
as hard as ever she could, and every once in a while
she'd heave a turrible sythe. Bymeby says she,
'Miss Pendergrass, do you expect to finish that web?'

<!-- page 124 -->

'Well, I ruther guess I shall,' says the old lady, says
she, 'if I live.' 'If you <i>live</i>,' says Miss Green, 'that's
the pint&mdash;for my part I've sot my house in order, and
I'm ready to go any minnit, and I wish you could
say the same. It's raly a moloncolly sight to see you
so occupied with the consarns o' this world that's jest
a comin' to and eend. I don't see how you <i>can</i> set
there a weavin' a piece o' cloth when the day o' the
Lord's so nigh at hand,' and she took a normous pinch
o' snuff, and gi'n a dretful groan. 'Well,' says old
Miss Pendergrass, says she, 'I'm glad you feel so sartin
about yer condition&mdash;I'd as lieve the Lord would
find me a weavin' cloth as a <i>takin' snuff</i>.' "</p>

<p>"Well, that was a good un! It ought to stopped
the old woman's mouth and sot her a thinkin'. Miss
Fustick <i>is</i> some such a woman in some respects."</p>

<p>"I was pleased to hear Cappen Smalley take up
agin her in favor o' tea and coffee, t'other night, in to
Miss Grimes's. By the way, Cappen Smalley's quite
an intellectible man, ain't he?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes&mdash;he <i>knows</i> enough. It kind o' strikes
me he's a steppin' up to Charity&mdash;seems to go there
considerable."</p>

<p>"You don't! Well ther's no accountin' for tastes,
I <i>dew</i> say, I should a took the cappen for a man o'
better judgment than to be pleased with such a critter.
Don't you think she's awful dizagreeable?"</p>

<p>"Well, I must say I don't admire her no great."</p>

<!-- page 125 -->

<p>"And then she's so awful humbly tew. What a
draw up nose she's got! And she's so turribly affected
and stuck up. I took a dislike tew her the
first time I ever see her&mdash;when she come in here with
her mother. The widder's a skew-jawed oncomfortable
lookin' old critter, ain't she?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and no wonder, for she's tew stingy to <i>feel</i>
comfortable, and of course she can't <i>look</i> so. You
was sayin', a spell ago, that I thought every body was
dretfal nice, and dretfal clever, and I told ye ther was
some folks I had a turrible mean opinion of&mdash;well, the
Widder Grimes is one on 'em&mdash;she's the meanest
woman in the neighborhood."</p>

<p>"Is, hay! Well I reckoned whether or no she wa'n't
when I seen her."</p>

<p>"And Charity's a chip o' the old block. They git
their livin' by visitin' and borrerin'. They keep that
little black girl o' theirn on a trot the heft o' the time&mdash;runnin'
after <i>a little piece</i> o' butter here, a half a loaf
o' bread there, and a little o' this that and t'other in
another place&mdash;and they ain't everlastin' partickler
about payin'. They borrer a good deal o' me, and I
ginerally let 'em have it. 'Tain't much they ax for
at once, and I hate to refuse when I've got it in the
house. They send every few days for a slice or tew
of bread, and so it goes on for some time&mdash;till what
they've got amounts to mabbe, half a dozen loaves&mdash;and
then the little nigger comes in with a loaf o' bread,

<!-- page 126 -->

and says she, 'Missy Grimes sends this loaf o' bread
and wants Missy Magwire to <i>take off whut's right</i>.
The last time she sent hum bread in that way&mdash;only
a few days ago&mdash;husband was in&mdash;I took the loaf and
was a gwine to cut off a piece as usual&mdash;but husband
laid his hand on my arm, and says he, 'Stop, Melissy&mdash;don't
you cut that&mdash;here, <i>Snowball</i>, take it hum
and tell Miss Grimes 'twouldent be <i>right</i> to take off
<i>none on't</i>.' I don't know whether they took the hint&mdash;time'll
show. But I got rid o' ther borrerin' coffee
the slickest&mdash;or ruther husband did&mdash;'twas his dewins.
They used to send about once a week after
coffee&mdash;and once in a while they'd send hum a cup
full, ready ground&mdash;and of all things! such miserable
stuff I never laid my mouth tew! 'twas as black as
dirt. I biled some on't once or twice, and then I gin
it up&mdash;for husband nor Jeff wouldent nary one on
'em touch it&mdash;they declared 'twa'n't nothin' but burnt
bread-crusts. At last, one day when Miss Grimes
sent hum some coffee, husband happened to be in.
After the nigger'd gone he says to me, says he, 'Now,
Melissy, you save that coffee, and the next time Miss
Grimes sends to borrer, jest give it tew her.' Well,
'twant long afore they sent agin. Dianny come in
with her cup and said Missy Grimes had company
come onexpected, and hadent no coffee burnt, and
wanted to git a little. So I goes to the cubberd and
fetches out the same old stuff and gives it tew her.

<!-- page 127 -->

I tell ye I felt rather mean when I gi'n it tew her,
but then I'd promised husband I would, and besides,
I kind o' wanted to see how 'twould operate. That
was three months ago, and they hain't sent for coffee
sence."</p>

<p>"Well that was about the cutest thing I ever heerd
o' your dewin, Melissy. You sarved 'em right. But
ain't it curus 't Cappen Smalley should be pleased with
Charity? wonder if he knows how mean they be?"</p>

<p>"If he did 'twould be a recommendation tew him."</p>

<p>"What! Cappen Smalley ain't a tight man, is he?"</p>

<p>"Tight! yes, tight as the skin tew his back."</p>

<p>"Well, now, I <i>am</i> beat! Why how oncommon
good and ginerous he talked t'other night, when he
come in to Parson Tuttle's, when we was there to tea&mdash;seemed
to be so ingaged in every menevolent operation."</p>

<p>"Yes, he's famous for wishin' 'tevery body might
be warmed and clothed; but somehow or another he
never <i>hands over</i>. Whenever any body goes tew him
with a subscription-paper, he always seems highly delighted
with it&mdash;says it's an excellent objick&mdash;an
objick he feels wonderfully interested in&mdash;he <i>does</i>
hope they'll succeed in raisin' enough for't&mdash;'twould
be <i>shameful</i> if they dident. But he'd ruther not put
his name down&mdash;he has an aversion to makin' a display&mdash;he
wishes they'd go all round and raise what
they can, and if they don't git enough, come to him,

<!-- page 128 -->

and he'll <i>make up what's lackin</i>'. Somehow or another
it don't often happen't he's called on to make up
what's lackin': when he <i>is</i>, he's generally missin'.
Parson Tuttle don't seem to see through him yet&mdash;he
thinks he's a wonderful charitable man."</p>

<p>"Speakin' o' Parson Tuttle&mdash;seems to me he ain't
very <i>deep</i>."</p>

<p>"O, Parson Tuttle's considerable of a man; he's
young yet, but I think he's got a good deal o' staminy
in him. He'll improve as he grows older."</p>

<p>"Well, whether he improves or not, it's my opinion
he won't never be able to hold a candle to Elder
Sniffles."</p>

<p>"Granf'ther grievous! you ain't in airnest, Silly?"</p>

<p>"I be tew. I think Elder Sniffles is equil to Parson
Potter."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll give it up now. I always thought the
elder was ruther of a dough-head."</p>

<p>"No thin' but prejudice, Melissy&mdash;nothin' in the
world but prejudice, 'cause he happens to belong to a
different seck from yourn&mdash;'tain't right to be so set in
yer way."</p>

<p>"Deary me, Silly! seems to me you're got to be
wonderful forbearin', lately; you used to blaze away
about the Baptists turribly."</p>

<p>"I know I dident use to like 'em much, but 'twas
'cause I dident know much about 'em, and husband
you know, couldent bear 'em,"</p>

<!-- page 129 -->

<p>"Well, I disremember about that: but I <i>dew</i> remember
o' hearin' you blow him up once for gwine to Baptist
meetin'."</p>

<p>"Well, I say for't, your memory's wonderful good&mdash;considerable
better 'n mine. Any how&mdash;s'posen a
body <i>does</i> dislike a sartin seck, and express ther sentiments
agin 'em&mdash;is that any reason why they shouldent
be open to conviction; and alter ther minds consarnin'
'em?"</p>

<p>"To be sure not&mdash;but it does seem queer to me't
you should be so eat up with Elder Sniffles, when you
hain't heerd him preach but once: but he's widdiwer
now, and I s'pose <i>that</i> makes his preachin' a good deal
interestiner. Shouldent wonder if you'd heerd he'd
lost his wife, afore you went to his meetin'&mdash;hadent
ye? now, Silly, own up."</p>

<p>"Melissy Magwire! I should like to know what
you mean to insinniwate. If I take a notion to go to
Baptist meetin' or any other meetin', I got a right to
dew it, and I <i>will</i> dew it as much as I'm a mind tew,
and if my motives is impunged, I can't help it&mdash;that's
all."</p>

<p><i>Enter Mr. Maguire</i>&mdash;"What ye jawin', about, now?"</p>

<p>"We wa'n't a jawin', was we, sister Bedott? we
was only, discussin'."</p>

<p>"Cussin', hey? well, then, what was ye <i>cussin'</i>
about?"</p>

<p>"What a critter you be to misunderstand! I dident

<!-- page 130 -->

say <i>cussin</i>' but <i>dis</i>cussin'. We was discussin' Elder
Sniffles&mdash;ye know Silly thinks he's something supernatral."</p>

<p>"Haw! haw! haw! what if Silly should git to be
a Baptist! wouldent it be a joke, though? But look
here, Silly, you must be carful how ye set yer traps
for the elder&mdash;it might be dangerous to interfere with
Sally Hugle's pretensions. Don't ye s'pose wife, that
Sally's ruther a squintin' that way?"</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldent wonder if she was; I don't
s'pose she'd have any <i>serus</i> objections to changin' her
condition. That are piece of poitry o' hern, that cum
out in the paper last week, looked ruther <i>pinted</i>, dident
it?"</p>

<p>"What! sister Magwire, you don't mean to say't
Sally Hugle writes poitry?"</p>

<p>"Lawful sakes, yes! she writes bushels on't&mdash;curus
kind o' poitry, tew. Ther's some on't comes out almost
every week in the 'Scrabble Hill Luminary.'
She signs it 'Hugeliner.' She generally calls 'em
'<i>sunnets</i>'&mdash;Jeff says they ought to be called <i>moonets</i>,
cause they're always full o' stuff about the moon and
stars, and so on. She's always groanin' away about
her <i>inward griefs</i>, and <i>unknown miseries</i>. I don't know
what to make on't. Sally Hugle never had no partickler
trouble as I know on&mdash;without 'twas her not
bein able to ketch a husband."</p>

<p>"See, wife&mdash;what was that she writ on the death of

<!-- page 131 -->

Elder Sniffleses wife? can't you remember some on't.
I thought <i>that</i> was about as <i>rich</i> as any thing o' hern
I'd seen."</p>

<p>"Lemme see. I'm sure I'd ought to remember it;
for Jeff had it over all the time for about a week&mdash;a
singin' it through his nose to the tune o' 'Saint Martins'&mdash;that
goes shakin' up and down ye know, kind o'
sollem. Less see&mdash;seems to me this was the way it
begun.&mdash;</p>

<p>'As droops the pale effulgent flower,<br/>

By wintry breezes tried&mdash;<br/>

So, in an onexpected hour.<br/>

Dear Missis Sniffles died.'</p>

<p>Now what comes next? Oh, I remember&mdash;</p>

<p>'No more her sorrowin' pardner hears<br/>

The voice he loved below&mdash;<br/>

While tears, unmitigated tears,<br/>

Reveal his bosom's woe.</p>

<p>'In that respect such grief as hisen<br/>

Is different from my own,<br/>

Which, in my heart's dark mournful prison,<br/>

Lies ranklin' unbeknown;'</p>

<p>"Ther's more on't, but I forgit what 'tis."</p>

<p>"That's enough any way, wife&mdash;what do ye think
on't, sister Bedott&mdash;s'pose ye could beat it?"</p>

<p>"I should be sorry if I couldent&mdash;why I could
make better poitry'n that by throwin' an inkstand at
a sheet o' paper. I wonder if she expects the elder'll
be took with such stuff. If he is, I'm mistaken."</p>

<p>"S'pose you take hold, then, and see if ye can't

<!-- page 132 -->

write her down&mdash;wouldent it be a capital idee, wife,
for Silly to write a piece o' poitry to the elder, and
have it printed in the 'Luminary.' Come on, Silly&mdash;that
you writ on Miss Crane's death was very <i>touchin</i>',
though it dident seem to <i>touch</i> Mr. Crane much."

<p>"Brother Magwire, I look upon't as an insult, to
have old Crane's name mentioned in my hearin'&mdash;considerin'
all the lies that's told about him and me, and
all the trouble his disagreeable attentions gin me&mdash;and
I hope in futur you'll keep silent on that onpleasant
subjick."</p>

<p>"I beg yer pardon, sister Bedott. I forgot you was
so sore on that pint. But I'm in arnest about that
poitry. Why not try, and see if you can't beat 'Hugeliner'
all holler."</p>

<p>"Seems to me you're changed yer mind about my
poitry; you used to turn up yer nose at it."</p>

<p>"O, well, my taste improves as I git older. I admire
poitry more'n I used to."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll show you some varses I writ a spell ago
on the Mexican War&mdash;and see what you think on
'em." [She goes to bring them, and Mrs. Maguire remarks&mdash;]</p>

<p>"Now, Joshaway, ain't you ashamed o' yerself!
You'd ought to know better'n to go to puttin' Silly
up to writin' poitry&mdash;first we know she'll be a sendin'
some of her stuff to the 'Luminary,' and it'll make
<i>her</i> ridickilous, and us tew."</p>

<!-- page 133 -->

<p>"Don't fret your gizzard, Melissy. Nobody won't
think nothing she does is ridickilous&mdash;for ye know it's
ginerally thought she's a rich widder, and every body'll
be ready to swaller her poitry&mdash;I don't care if it's the
tarnalest mess o' stuff that ever was put together."</p>

<h3>XIII.</h3>

<h3>The Widow having Heard that Elder Sniffles is Sick,
Writes to Him.</h3>

</div>

<p>DEAR ELDER:</p>

<p>I DON'T know but what you'll consider it ruther
forrard in me to trouble you with this epistol, bein'
as I'me a'most a strainger; but I hope youle overlook
my appearent want of judition, and attribit this
communication to the oncommon interest I take in
your welfare. Sence the first time I heerd you preach,
I've had had an undescriberble desire to hev some
privit conversation with you, in regard to the state o'
my mind&mdash;your discourse was so wonderful searchin'
that I felt to mourn over my backslidden state o'
stewpidity, and my consarn has increased every time
I've sot under the droppin's o' your sanctuery. Last
night when I heerd o' your sickness, I felt wonderful
overcome; enable to conseal my aggitation, I retired
to my chamber, and bust into a flood o' tears. I felt
for you, Elder Sniffles&mdash;I felt for you. I was wonderful
exercised in view of your lone condition. O,
it's a terrible thing to be alone in the world! I know

<!-- page 135 -->

all about it by experience, for I've ben pardnerless
for nigh twelve year; it's a tryin' thing, but I thought
'twas better to be alone than to run enny resk&mdash;for
you know it's runnin' a grate resk to take a second
companion, espeshelly if they ain't decidedly pious&mdash;and
them that's tried' to perswade me to change my
condition, dident none on 'em give very satisfactory
evidence of pioty&mdash;'tain't for me to say how menny
I've refused on account o' ther want o' religion.
Accordin' to my notions, riches and grander ain't to
be compaired to religion, no how you can fix it, and
I always told 'em so. But I was a tellin' how overcome
I was when I heerd o' your bein' attackted with
influenzy. I felt as if I must go right over and take
care of you. I wouldent desire no better intertainment
than to nuss you up, and if 'twa'n't for the
speech o' peeple, I'd fly to your relefe instanter; but
I know 'twould make talk, and so I feel necessiated to
stay away. But I felt so consarned about you, that
I couldent help writin' these few lines to let you know
how anxious I be on your account, and to beg o' you
to take care o' yerself. O, elder, do be careful&mdash;the
influenzy's a dangerous epedemic, if you let it run on
without attendin' to it in season. Do be kerful&mdash;consider
what a terrible thing 'twould be for you to be
took away in the haight of yer usefulness; and O,
elder, nobody wouldent feel yer loss with more intensitude
than what I should, though mebby I hadent

<!-- page 136 -->

ought to say so. O, Elder Sniffles, I feel as if I
couldent part with you, no how. I'me so interested
in your preachin', and it's had such a wonderful attendency
to subdew my prejudices aginst your denomination,
and has sot me a considerin' whether or
no I wa'n't in the wrong. O, reverend elder, I intreat
you to take case o' yer preshus helth. I send you
herewith a paper o' boneset, you must make some
good stiff tea out, and drink about a quart to-night
afore you retire. Molasses and vinegar's a good
thing too for a cold or coff; jest take about a pint o'
molasses and bile it down with a teacup of vinegar
and a hunk o' butter as big as a hen's egg, and stir in
about a half a teacup full of pepper sass, and eat it
down hot jest afore bedtime&mdash;and take a strip o'
flannil, and rub some hog's lard on't, though goose
ile's about as good, and pin it round yer throte right
off; and I send likewise a bag o' hops; you must dip
it in bilin' vinegar, and lay it on yer chist when you
go to bed, and keep a dippin' on't as fast as it begins
to git cool; and jest afore you git into bed, soke yer
feet in bilin' hot water with some red peppers in it;
now don't forgit nothin' I've proscribed. But I was
a tellin' how exercised I felt last night when I heard
o' your sickness. I went immejitly to my chamber,
and gin way to my grefe in a violent flood of tears.
I retired to my couch o' repose, but my aggitation
pervented my sleepin'. I felt quite a call to express

<!-- page 137 -->

my feelin's in poitry&mdash;I'me very apt to when enny
thing comes over me&mdash;so I riz and lifted my candle,
and composed these stanzys, which I hope will be
agreeable to you.</p>

<p>O reverend sir, I do declare,<br/>

It drives me a'most to frenzy,<br/>

To think o' you a lyin' there<br/>

Down sick with influenzy.</p>

<p>A body'd a thought it was enough<br/>

To mourn yer wife's departer,<br/>

Without such trubble as this 'ere<br/>

To come a follerin' arter.</p>

<p>But sickness and affliction is trials sent<br/>

By the will o' a wise creation,<br/>

And allways ought to be underwent<br/>

With fortytude and resignation.</p>

<p>Then mourn not for yer pardner's death,<br/>

But to submit endevver;<br/>

For s'posen she hadent a died so soon,<br/>

She couldent a lived forever.</p>

<p>O, I could to your bedside fly,<br/>

And wipe yer weepin' eyes,<br/>

And try my best to cure you up,<br/>

If 'twouldent create surprise.</p>

<p>It's a world o' trial we tarry in&mdash;<br/>

But elder, don't dispair;<br/>

That you may soon be movin' agin,<br/>

Is constantly my prayer.</p>

<p>Both sick and well, you may depend<br/>

Youle never be forgot,<br/>

By your faithful and affectionate friend,<br/>

PRISCILLA POOL BEDOTT.</p>

<p>P. S. My nefew, Jefferson Magwire, will hand you
this epistol, I should be wonderful happified to receve

<!-- page 138 -->

a few lines from you when you git able, jest to
show whether or no you think me forrard in addressin'
you in this manner. P. P. B.</p>

<p>P. S. Now do be cerful o' yerself, dear elder&mdash;excuse
me for callin' you dear, it came out afore I was
aware on't&mdash;don't fail to foller my directions, espeshelly
about the boneset; it's the sovereinest cure in
nater for influenzy&mdash;and be shure to soke yer feet in
the hot water and peppers&mdash;ther ain't nothin' like it
to fetch down infermation&mdash;and bind up yer throte in

keep a pan o' hot vinegar on top o' yer stove, and dip

give you such a good night's rest&mdash;hops is

<p>ELDER SNIFFLES' REPLY.</p>

</div>

<p>MOST WORTHY MRS. BEDOTT:</p>

<p>Your communication of yesterday was duly received
at the hand of your nephew. At the period
of its reception, I was laboring under too great a
degree of corporeal prostration to dictate an immediate
response. But at present, feeling my physical condition

<!-- page 139 -->

to be, to some extent, ameliorated, I hasten to
respond. Accept my most unqualified acknowledgments
for the interest which you apparently take in
my welfare&mdash;and for the articles which you so kindly
transmitted by your nephew. Permit me, also, to
assure you of my abundant gratification at the assurance
that my unpretending discourses have been the
feeble instrument of exerting a salutary influence upon
your mind. I feel, most deeply do I feel, that I am
but a poor unworthy worm of the dust; and it serves
but to augment my humiliation to reflect that my
labors in the field have been so signally blessed. Your
remedies, most excellent madam, I have applied in
accordance with your directions; and it affords me
no inconsiderable satisfaction to be able to say that I
think I can safely affirm that their effects upon my
system have been salubrious; and I can but indulge
the hope that they will tend to my ultimate restoration.
I must not, however, omit to mention, that I did
not realize, to the full extent, the efficacy of the hop-bag;
for after having arisen agreeably to your directions,
some five or six times (it may be seven, I will
not venture to speak positively as to the number) and
immersed the hop-bag in the boiling vinegar, I regret
to say that I unintentionally fell into a state of
unconsciousness, from which I unhappily did not
awake until morning. Owing to this unfortunate occurrence,
I probably did not enjoy the refreshing

<!-- page 140 -->

repose which a constant application of the hot hop-bag
would have afforded. However, notwithstanding
this unintentional neglect, I am happy to state
that the virulence of my attack is decidedly abated.</p>

<p>I acknowledge myself deeply indebted for the poem
which accompanied your communication. It was
truly gratifying to my feelings. Your remark therein
embodied, that "we tarry in a world of trial," is a
very just one&mdash;very, indeed. This is incontrovertibly
a life of trials&mdash;of disappointment and fluctuations,
sent, undoubtedly, for the fortification of our faith.
It will afford me most unmitigated pleasure to converse
with you privately, in regard to your mind, and
to give you such instructions upon doctrinal points
as may be necessary and conducive to your spiritual
edification. With that view, I invite you to call at
my residence on Friday evening next, when, if no
unforeseen contingencies intervene to prevent, and my
corporeal condition continues to improve, I shall be
unoccupied and most happy to attend to your case,
and enlighten you in relation to such inquiries as you
may be pleased to propound.</p>

<p>With sentiments of unmitigated regard,<br/>

I remain your obliged friend,<br/>

O. SHADRACK SNIFFLES.</p>

<p>"WHERE you gwine, sister Bedott?"</p>

<p>"Well, I thought I'd go to Parson Tuttle's
Friday evenin' lectur."</p>

<p>"Why ther ain't none. Don't you remember Mr.
Tuttle said last Sunday that he'd got to be away to-day,
and the lectur'd be omitted?"</p>

<p>"O, sure enough&mdash;so he did. But come to think&mdash;don't
you remember he said the brethern and sisters
might meet and have a season o' prayer?"</p>

<p>"O, yes&mdash;he did says so. But lawful sakes! I don't
think it's very edifyin' to go set a hull evenin' and
hear Deacon Fustick and Deacon Peabody and old
Parker hold forth."</p>

<p>"Nor I nother. But then I think it's my duty to
go once in a while. Ye know Scripter says we musn't
forsake the assemblin' of ourselves together. I guess
I'll go tew night."</p>

<p>[She departs and proceeds to Elder Sniffles' residence.]</p>

<!-- page 142 -->

<p>"Good evenin', Elder Sniffles. You see I'm punctable
to the time. I always make it a pint to be. I
think punctability's very, important."</p>

<p>"A very just remark, Mrs. Bedott&mdash;it is so&mdash;and I
am most happy to receive you this evening."</p>

<p>"Well, how's your health now? Convalessin', I
hope?"</p>

<p>"It affords me the most unmitigated satisfaction to
be able to state that my corporeal system has, in a
great measure, recovered its usual tone."</p>

<p>[With much fervor.] "O how thankful I be to hear
you say so, Elder Sniffles. You can't have the remotest
idee o' my anxiety on your account, and how
delighted I feel to find you so much better, and I
hope you've recovered yer tone so's to be able to sing
agin. It's a great blessin' to sing when a body has
such a powerful voice as yourn. I've obsarved it a
Sabberdays in meetin'. O how oneasy I've been
about you when I thought you might be took away,
and me never hear you preach no more. I felt as if I
couldent submit to't no how. 'Twas a dretful subjick
o' retrospection to think o' your dessolution.  I
was wonderful glad to git your letter, and know't you
dident think I'd overtopt the bounds of propriety in
writin' to you. I was <i>so</i> afeared you would. But I
felt so consairned for fear you wouldent be comfortable
and have such care as you'd ought tew&mdash;livin' all
alone so&mdash;nobody in the house but a little chore-gal&mdash;and

<!-- page 143 -->

what does she know about taking care of a sick
man?"</p>

<p>"O, Sally does very well. As a general thing she
discharges the duties devolving upon her with fidelity
and&mdash;"

<p>"As fur as <i>you</i> know, undoubtedly&mdash;but 'tain't
likely you know jest how things goes on. I never
know'd a gal o' her age but what wanted watchin'
every minnit. You can't trust 'em they're such
highty-tighty critters. And then the best on 'em
wants a <i>head</i> to oversee 'em all the time&mdash;the very
best on 'em can't dew for you as a pardner would.
O, when an indiwiddiwal's sick then's the time they
feel the want of a companion, and ministers is so apt
to git sick, ye know."</p>

<p>"A very just remark, ma'am&mdash;very indeed. Our
profession is arduous. I myself am the subject of
frequent valetudinary attacks&mdash;the effects, undoubtedly,
of intense application."</p>

<p>"Jest so. I remember Parson Potter, our minister
in Wiggletown, used to have a great many poor turns,
dispepshy-like&mdash;his vittals distresst him."</p>

<p>"He was a Presbyterian clergyman, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes. He labored in Wiggletown ten years. My
husband was deacon all the time he was there. Died
about a year after Parson Potter left there. Husband
used to have such attacks as yourn, tew. He enjoyed
miserable health for a number o' year afore he died.

<!-- page 144 -->

He was a feeble constitutioned man. I s'pose he
wouldent a lived no wher nigh as long as he did if I
hadent a ben undefateegable in takin' care of him.
O, how I did watch that man! For six or seven
years afore his dessolution I gi'n up my hull time tew
him. The neighbors used to say, 'Miss Bedott, you'll
sartinly wear yerself out takin' care o' the deacon.'
'Well,' says I, 'it'll be in a good cause if I dew. I
consider it a duty and a privilege to devote myself to
my husband. I don't want no better occerpation.'
And 'twas a wonderful comfort tew me after his
dizease, to think I had been so devoted. O elder,
mine was a dretful loss! I've always felt as if
'twould be very difficult to make it up to me. My
friends has wondered at me for continiwin single
so long, but, as I obsarved in my letter, I always
told 'em 'twas a very resky bisness to take a second
pardner, very resky, indeed. Don't you think so,
elder?"</p>

<p>"I do, indeed; the selection of a consort, either
first or second, is a matter of immense importance,
and involves consequences of tremendous magnitude.
In my opinion, it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I says to 'em, says I, when they was a teazin' me
to git married agin, I says to 'em, says I, don't speak
on't, don't&mdash;I've had one o' best o' men for a pardner,
and I lived in the greatest conjugial felicitude
with him; and that's the reason why I'm so pertickler

<!-- page 145 -->

now&mdash;piety's every thing&mdash;don't you think so,
Elder Sniffles?"</p>

<p>"A very just remark, Mrs. Bedott&mdash;piety is every
thing, truly. Your late consort was, undoubtedly, a
pious individual; though, as you begin to perceive,
being a Presbyterian, he must necessarily have held
some views which undoubtedly were&mdash;were&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;husband <i>was</i> ruther sot in his way, and
that's the reason why I never got inlightened on some
pints&mdash;husband always thought every thing Parson
Potter said was jest right; and Parson Potter was a
wonderful prejudiced man. He writ a couple o' sarmons
aginst the Baptists, and had 'em printed; and
husband used to read 'em over and over again. Yes&mdash;'tain't
to be denied that husband was mistaken on
some doctrinal pints&mdash;my mind has been wonderfully
exercised about it lately."</p>

<p>"I should judge so from your letter; and I trust&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ever sence the first time I heerd you preach, I've
felt oneasy; I says to my nephew Jefferson Magwire&mdash;(ye
know he went with me to the meetin')&mdash;Jeff,
says I, I feel as if I <i>must</i> hear Elder Sniffles convarse.
You see, Jeff had been a tellin' me afore we went
what an interestin' preacher you was; but I'd no idee
I should be so much affected&mdash;mabby you obsarved
I was quite overcome at one part o' the discourse;
'twas when you dwelt upon the changeable natur of
arthly happiness&mdash;the onsartinty of every thing&mdash;it

<!-- page 146 -->

touched a tender pint. I thought how it applied to
my case&mdash;my circumstances is so changed&mdash;alone in
the world&mdash;without a sympathizin' buzzom to lean on&mdash;nobody
to take any pertickler intrest in me." [She
covers her face with her handkerchief, and appears
much agitated.]</p>

<p>"But, Mrs., Bedott, in this mundane sphere, we
should endeavor to be prepared for the innumerable
fluctuations which&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm aware on't. Elder Sniffles&mdash;I'm intirely
aware o' the truth o' what you obsarve; but then you
know an indiwiddiwal in my sittiwation has so many
onpleasat things to incounter; if they're ever so kerful,
folks <i>will</i> talk and say they're a gwine to change
ther condition&mdash;and be all the time a pickin' out this
one and that one for 'em&mdash;when they hain't no more
idee o' changin' ther condition than they have o' flyin'.
And then ther's another dretful trial we have to undergo;
dew what we will, we can't git red o' the impartinent
attentions o' the men folks. If we're ever
so stiff and haughty tew 'em, they won't seem to mind
it a speck; they <i>will</i> keep a makin' up tew us&mdash;and
you've no idee how dizagreeable 'tis&mdash;'twas the principal
cause o' my leavin' Wiggletown. As long as
my son and darter was with me, I felt as if 'twas my
duty to stay there&mdash;but when they got married and
left me, it seemed as if I couldent stan' it no longer&mdash;not
that I've got any thing to say against the indiwidiwals

<!-- page 147 -->

that was pleased with me&mdash;'twa'n't <i>their</i> fault
that I wa'n't suited with ary one on 'em; but 'twas
very onpleasant to be the objick o' their preference,
when I couldent recipperate none o' ther feelins&mdash;and
was detarmined never to unite my destination to a person
that was destitute o' religion. 'Twas a tryin' sitiwation
to be placed in: but dear me! it's awful tryin'
to be without a companion, as I remarked in some
stanzys I was a writin' 't other day.</p>

<p>What sittiwation <i>can</i> be wuss<br/>

Than not to haye nobody to care for <i>us!</i><br/>

Riches and honors that most folks prize,<br/>

Ain't of no vally in my eyes<br/>

In comparison with a congenial heart,<br/>

In all our consarns to take a part;<br/>

To recipperate all our buzzom's emotions,<br/>

And to take the lead in our daily devotions.</p>

<p>"Ain't them your sentiments, elder?"</p>

<p>"They are so, Mrs. Bedott; the society of a congenial
spirit is truly desirable. In particular, I consider
congeniality of sentiments to be indispensable as regards
religious opinions; and as you have expressed a
desire to receive some instructions relating to doctrinal
points&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I <i>have</i> felt very much exercised lately. I've
felt to deplore my lukewarmness and want o' zeal,
but especially I've felt to mourn over my former prejudices
against your seck: but you see I've always ben
placed under onfortinate circumstences&mdash;circumstences
that's had an attendency to exart an onfavorable influence

<!-- page 148 -->

on my religious faith; and it actilly seems as
if the hand o' Providence was in my comin' here to
Scrabble Hill, instid o' concludin' to go to Varmount
to my brother, Christopher Columbus Poole's. They
wanted I should come there, but somehow another I
felt a loud call to come here. I speak on't in another
stanzy o' the same poem I illuded tew jest now. I
says, says I&mdash;</p>

<p>Yes, sartin there was a providence in it,<br/>

And I shall always bless the minnit<br/>

That fixed my choice on Scrabble Hill,<br/>

Instid o' the town o' Buttonville&mdash;</p>

<p>S'posen I'd a went to Buttonville, and stayed all winter,
instid o' comin' here&mdash;how different my circumstences
would a ben. O, Elder Sniffles, what a privilege
'tis to set Sabberday after Sabberday under your
preachin', and to be permitted to come to yer house
and injoy the benefit o' hearin' you convarse on religious
subjicks. I dew feel as if I couldent be thankful
enough. The day you was t' our house to dinner, I
was wonderfully interested in yer conversation. I
s'pose you obsarved I was ruther tackciturn most o'
the time&mdash;'twas cause I felt under considerable constraint.
Sister Magwire and her husband is very well
meanin' folks, but they're dretful narrer minded and
sot in ther way. I don't never feel free to express my
mind afore 'em as I'd like tew&mdash;you know a body
can't when they're so sittiwated&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 149 -->

<p>"Exactly&mdash;a very just remark&mdash;in order to enjoy
the entire benefit of intellectual or religious discourse,
an individual must be wholly unrestrained. The present
occasion, therefore, is one suited to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, felt <i>so</i> gratified when I got your letter and invitation
to come round here to-night. O, thinks me,
what a blessid privilege 'tis&mdash;I dew hope I 'preciate
it&mdash;but O, elder, elder, what if it should git out that I
come here alone, and in the evenin'! What <i>would</i>
some folks say? You know ther's so many that's
ready to ketch up every little thing, and make the
most on't. Gracious sakes alive! what <i>should</i> I dew
if the story should get round that I was settin' my cap
for you! and I know 'twould if Sally Hugle should
find out I come here to-night&mdash;they say she's a dretful
meddlin' critter, and I'm sure she don't feel none
o' the frenliest to me; I s'pose it's cause I hain't shewed
no great anxiety to cultivate her society. The fact
is the minnit I first set my eyes on her, I made up my
mind she wa'n't a person I cared about havin' for an
intimit: her countenance is so dizagreeable. I should
know she had an onpleasant disposition; thinks me
she's got <i>grit</i> and no mistake. Brother Magwire says
he should pity any man that would be draw'd in by
her, cause she's so lazy. They say when she ain't a
spinnin' street yarn, she don't dew nothin' but write
poitry; her mother and sister Polly has the hull heft
o' the housekeepin' on their shoulders; Now I say

<!-- page 150 -->

ther ain't no need o' neglectin' yer-duties to write poitry:
for I've writ a sight on't in my day&mdash;enough, I
should say, to fill a bushel basket&mdash;and nobody can't
say't I ever allowed it to interfere with my domestic
consarns. A body can write poitry and be industrous
tew. And massy on me! such poitry as hern! did
you ever!&mdash;but 'tain't for me to crittycise other folkses
writin's, nor I don't want to say nothin' deroggery to
Sally Hugle&mdash;only I <i>dew</i> hope she never'll find out
about my comin' here. O, Elder Sniffles, I'm a lone
woman; ther ain't nobody to stan' up for my rights,
if the voice o' slander should be raised aginst me."
[She weeps.]</p>

<p>"Be calm, Mrs. Bedott&mdash;[he approaches and sits
down beside her]&mdash;permit me to assure you that your
apprehensions are utterly groundless. You are quite
too sensitive&mdash;quite. It is no unusual circumstance for
individuals of your sex to resort to me for religious
instruction and private conversation in regard to the
state of their minds."</p>

<p>"Does Sally Hugle ever come for private conversation?"</p>

<p>"I believe&mdash;indeed it strikes me that Miss Hugle
has done so once or twice."</p>

<p>"O, Elder Sniffles, beware of that critter. Depend
on't 'tain't for the sake o' gittin instruction she comes.
It's jist for to insiniwate herself into your favor&mdash;and
judgin' from what I've seen and heerd of her, I

<!-- page 151 -->

shouldent wish my worst innemy a greater cuss
than to git her for a pardner. Old maids always
makes miserable wives&mdash;and of all things, to think o'
such a person as Sally Hugle bein' united to a man
like Elder Sniffles! A man that ought to have the
very salt of the arth for a companion. O, it's awful!
'Twould put an eend to your usefulness, depend on't."</p>

<p>"Compose yourself, my dear madam. Your fears
are unfounded. The interest which you take in my
welfare touches me deeply. If the period should ever
arrive when I shall deem it essential to select a second
consort, believe me, I shall&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, Elder Sniffles!"</p>

<p>"I shall proceed with the utmost caution and prudence."</p>

<p>[A hurried knock is heard at the door.]</p>

<p>"There! some body's a comin'. I must go."</p>

<p>"Well, allow me to entreat you to lay aside all apprehensions,
and resort to me whenever you wish to
unburden your mind, or receive religious instruction."</p>

<p>"I'm very much obleeged to ye, Elder Sniffles, very
much, indeed. I feel as if your conversation this
evenin' had done me a great deal o' good."</p>

<p>"Well now, if that don't beat all! did you ever see
any thing so redickilous in all your born days? you
may talk as much as you're a mind tew about 'hidden
meanin'.' I believe if there's any meanin' at all in a
thing it'll show out some wher&mdash;and for my part, I
can't see a speck nor grain o' sense in that are piece.
What on arth does the simpleton mean by blazin'
away so about her 'liar' and its 'thunder tones' and
'mournin' weeds,' and all that? I should think Elder
Sniffles would feel insulted by such a mess o' stuff&mdash;shouldent
you?"</p>

<p>"O, no, I dare say he'll consider it quite complimentary;
don't you see she talks about his eloquence&mdash;drawing
admiring crowds, and so forth? I guess
she means to catch the elder if she can; any how she
seems to be making a dead set at him, and I shouldn't
wonder if she should succeed."</p>

<p>"Well, if Sal Hugle ketches Elder Sniffles with
such trash as that, I'll give it up that's all; but I
don't bleve she will: he ain't so big a fool as to have
the wool drawd over his eyes in that way."</p>

<!-- page 154 -->

<p>"But you know she may possess other attractions
besides her poetical talents."</p>

<p>"Other attractions! goody grievous! I wonder what
they be! Of all created critters she's the dizagreeablest
I ever see, and so awfully humbly I shouldent
think she could feel comfortable. I guess she's one
o' them that's tew humbly to relish ther vittals. But
for all that, I bleve she thinks she's quite handsome.
What a way she's got o' fixin' her hair&mdash;them great
long stringlets a danglin' down her cheeks&mdash;her phizmahogany's
narrer enough without 'em, I'm sure. I
met her yisterdy as I was gwine to the store, and
'twas as much as I could dew to keep from bustin'
right out a laughin' in her face. She had on that
are everlastin' red hood that shows the hull o' her
face, and her curls was a streamin' down over the
corners of her mouth, so't a body'd a ben pestered
to tell how far round it went; and she was a salin'
along like a goose in a mud puddle, with her great
eyes a starin' straight at nothin'. She's got a way o'
lookin' as if she was gazin' into futewrity."</p>

<p>"That's a mark of genius, you know&mdash;a sign
that she lives in the shadowy regions of imagination&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shaddery fiddle-stick?"</p>

<p>"She was probably composing a sonnet when you
met her."</p>

<p>"Shoudent wonder if she was&mdash;she looked as if

she was occupied with somethin' despirit. Well, if I
couldent make out better 'n she does, I'd hang up my
fiddle&mdash;that's all!"</p>

<p>"Well, aunty, why don't you write some poetry
for the 'Luminary?' come, suppose you try your
hand at it&mdash;you're <i>great</i> on poetry."</p>

<p>"O, I don't feel willin' to make myself so conspiciwus."</p>

<p>"O fudge! that's nonsense&mdash;every one ought to be
willing to exercise their gift, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, it does look reasonable, but your mar always
discourages me about writin' poitry."</p>

<p>"What of that? father and I don't, and I'm sure
we're quite as competent judges as mother is. Come
now, if you'll write a piece of poetry I'll take it to
the 'Luminary' to-morrow, before I go back to Coonville.
I know you can beat Hugelina. Mother
needn't know any thing about it till it comes out, and
then she can't help herself."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know but what I will. I've got a
piece begun that I think's about as good as any thin'
I've writ in some time. Mabby I'll finish that off
and send it."</p>

<p>"What's the subject?"</p>

<p>"Well, it treats o' the onsartainty o' terrestrious
things. 'Twas occasioned by a remark in the first
sarmon I ever heard Elder Sniffles preach. You know

<!-- page 156 -->

he spoke o' our bein' onable to calkilate with any
degree o' sartainty."</p>

<p>"O yes, I remember it very well; that would be a
first-rate subject to write upon."</p>

<p>"I begin by alludin' to the elder's sarmon, and
then I goes on to testify to the truth on't by showin'
how diffikilt 'tis to make any kind o' calkilation
about any thing, bein' as all things of a transiterry
natur is so onsartin. But I'll go get it and show it
tew ye and then you can see for yourself. Here 'tis."
[Jeff reads it.]</p>

<p>"That's capital, Aunt Silly. Send it by all means.
I'll copy it off in a larger hand, so that it can be read
more easily. And what shall we call it? Suppose
we entitle it "Can't Calculate."</p>

<p>"Well, I should think that would be very approbriate."</p>

<p>"On second thoughts, I guess we'll just call it 'K. K.'&mdash;that
stands for 'can't calculate,' you know&mdash;and
there'll be something striking and original about it,
too."</p>

<p>"Just so. Well, you may fix it out as you're a
mind to&mdash;but I'll take it and add on a few more
stanzys first."</p>

<p>"O no, you needn't, it's plenty long enough&mdash;they
don't like to print long articles."</p>

<p>"Don't, hey? Well, it seems as if 'twa'n't hardly long
enough to pay a body for the trouble o' readin' on't."</p>

<!-- page 157 -->

<p>"Yes it is. It isn't so much the length of a poem
as the excellence of it that folks look at, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know but you're right, though I
remember how't Zebidee Higgins used to write very
long pieces. He writ a good deal for the 'Wiggletown
Banner,' and when Minarvy Pike died he writ
a piece on her death, and had it printed alone by itself
on a big sheet o' paper, and sold 'em for a shillin'
apiece. Ther was risin' a hundred varses on't. I
remember when he was a carryin' 'em around to sell,
he come t' our house, and husband bought one.
When he see how long 'twas, he says, says he to Zeb,
'Why, Zebidee, what was yer object in havin' on't
so long?' Says Zeb, says he, 'Don't ye s'pose I
wanted folks should git the worth o' their money?'
But as I don't charge nothin' for this ere, 'tain't so
much matter about its length, I s'pose. There, yer
mar's a comin', stick it away for pity's sake."</p>

contrast to the more highly wrought and elaborate
style of our own gifted 'Hugelina,' and strongly
reminds one of the effusions of the early masters of
English poesy, when the muse was in her pristine
purity. All worshipers of the truthful&mdash;the pure&mdash;the
earnest and the unadorned in poetry, will rejoice
with us that a brighter day appears about to dawn
upon our poetical horizon, and that the time is probably
not far distant when nature shall assert her supremacy
over art in the dominions of the muse. We
hope to hear often from our fair correspondent."</p>

<h3>The Widow Prepares to Receive Elder Sniffles
on Thanksgiving-Day.</h3>

</div>

<p>"SAY, sister Magwire, can't you spend time jest to
come here a minnit and look at my caps. I
want to ax you which I'd better wear to-day. I don't
want to wear it to meetin', cause my bunnit would
jam it all down&mdash;but I want to make up my mind
aforehand about it so's not to lose no time when I
git hum. Come quick, dew&mdash;the bell'll ring in a
minnit. O, here ye be; well, now tell, which o' these
caps is the becominest."</p>

<p>"Why, you've got a regiment on 'em seems to me."</p>

<p>"Yes; I'm well on't for caps&mdash;but the half on 'em
was giv' tew me. Here's one, though, 't I made myself.
I wore it to Kier's weddin'. How does it
look?" (She puts it on.)</p>

<p>"Somehow, I don't like that much&mdash;it sticks up tew
high on top: and then them yaller bows looks so
kind o' <i>darin</i>'; and then them red artifishels is ruther
<i>extensive</i>. I reckon you look better without artifishels."</p>

<p>"Well, lemme try on this ere; Melissy gin it tew
me. I always thought 'twas quite becomin'."</p>

<!-- page 162 -->

<p>"Well, I don't agree with ye, Silly. I think there's
tew much ribbin on't&mdash;pink ribbin tew; don't you
think pink ribbin's a'most tew <i>young</i> for you?"

<p>"O, dretful suz, Melissy! what foolish idees you've
got!&mdash;you're always a takin' me to dew about dressin'
<i>tew young</i>. What's the use o' makin' an old woman
o' myself afore I <i>be</i> one? But come to think, this
<i>would</i> be ruther dressy for to-day, seein' the minister's
a comin'. See 'f ye like this ere any better&mdash;'twas a
present from Sam Pendergrasses wife, not long afore
I come away. I never wore it but once."</p>

<p>"Well I reckon that looks woss than the pink one&mdash;blue
makes you look kind o' <i>squawy</i>; you're rather
dark complected; and blue's a tryin color for dark
skins."</p>

<p>"Well, I never thought I was so wonderful dark
complected, I'm sure. I wonder if this one'll suit
ye any better. Kier's wife gin it tew me. I hain't
never wore it at all; thought I shouldent, 'cause it's
so turrible old-womanish and quakery. I fetcht it
along, cause I thought mabby Seliny'd be mad if I
dident&mdash;but I don't see what on arth she meant by
givin' me such a lookin' thing."</p>

<p>"Now, Silly, I don't see how you can talk so&mdash;for
my part, I like that better 'n ary one you've tried on.
That are white satin trimmin' looks so kind o' neat
and plain. It's a purty shape tew&mdash;comes down furder'n
the others onto yer face&mdash;and that's an improvement,

<!-- page 163 -->

bein' as you're ruther long-favored. I'd
wear that by all means. Silly."</p>

<p>"You would!&mdash;well now I <i>am</i> beat&mdash;why ther ain't
a color about it but white."</p>

<p>"All the better for that; it's enough ginteeler'n
them flambergasted blue and yaller things; and then
the elder's a comin', ye know."</p>

<p>"Jest so; well I guess I <i>will</i> wear it considerin'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And yer black silk gownd and muslin underhandkercher&mdash;you
look best in them of any thing you've got."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know but what I will&mdash;murder!
there's the bell, and I hain't begun to be ready; never
mind, I won't dress till I git hum; this ere allipacker
looks well enough to wear to meetin'. I'll jest throw
on my mankiller and bunnit&mdash;'twon't take me long;
wish you could go Melissy&mdash;but I know ye can't and
git dinner tew; the elder's a gwine to preach in your
meetin'-house, hey?&mdash;well, that looks brotherly; Baptists
preach in your meetin'-house one year&mdash;and your
minister preach in theirn the next&mdash;I like the idee.
Is my bunnit on strait? This glass makes me look
kind o' skew-jawed&mdash;never know whether my things
is in decent order and reglar rotation or not, when I
git 'em on. How does this ere scarf go? Where's
brother Magwire and Jeff, I wonder? How thoughtful
'twas in Jeff to ax the elder here to dinner&mdash;he'd
a ben so lonesome to hum all alone. Melissy, I begin

<!-- page 164 -->

to have considerable hopes o' Jeff&mdash;shouldent wonder
if he should turn out quite a stiddy man after all.
Here they come."</p>

<p>"Elder Sniffles, let me give you another piece o' the
turkey."</p>

<p>"I'm obleeged to you, Mr. Maguire; you probably
recollect that I remarked in my discourse this morning,
that individuals were too prone to indulge in an
excessive indulgence in creature comforts on thanksgiving
occasions. In view of the lamentable fact that
the sin of gormandizing is carried to a sinful excess
on this day, I, as a preacher of the Gospel, deem it my
duty to be unusually abstemious on such occasions:
nevertheless, considering the peculiar circumstances
under which I am placed this day, I think I will
waive objections and take another small portion of the
turkey."</p>

<p>"That's right elder&mdash;what part will you take
now?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not particular; a small quantity of the
breast, with a part of a leg and some of the stuffing,
will be quite sufficient."</p>

<p>"Pass the cramberries to Elder Sniffles, Jeff&mdash;elder
help yourself; wife give the elder some more o' the
turnip sass and potater."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Maguire. I am an advocate for
a vegetable diet&mdash;and have always maintained that it

<!-- page 165 -->

is more congenial to individuals of sedentary habits
and intellectual pursuits like myself, than animal
food."</p>

<p>"Jeff, my son, pass the bread. Sister Bedott send
your plate for some more o' the turkey."</p>

<p>"No, I'm obleeged to ye&mdash;I've had sufficient."</p>

<p>"Jeff, cut the chicken pie."</p>

<p>"Sure enough&mdash;I almost forgot that I was to carve
the pie&mdash;Aunt Silly you'll take a piece of it, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't care if I dew take a leetle mite on't.
I'm a great favoryte o' chicken pie&mdash;always thought
'twas a delightful beverage&mdash;don't you Elder Sniffles?"</p>

<p>"A very just remark, Mrs. Bedott&mdash;very indeed;
chicken pie is truly a very desirable article of food."</p>

<p>"Allow me to help you to some of it, elder."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my young friend; as I before remarked,
I am entirely opposed to an immoderate indulgence
of the appetite at <i>all</i> times, but particularly on thanksgiving
occasions&mdash;and am myself <i>always</i> somewhat
abstemious. However, I consider it my duty at the
present time to depart, to some extent, from the usual
simplicity of my diet. I will, therefore comply with
your request and partake of the chicken pie."</p>

<p>"Take some more o' the cramberry sass, elder:
cramberries is hulsome."</p>

<p>"A very just remark, Mrs. Maguire&mdash;they are so;

<!-- page 166 -->

nevertheless, I maintain that we should not indulge
too freely in even the most wholesome of creature
comforts; however, since you desire it, I will take a
small portion more of the cranberries."</p>

<p>"Husband, dew pass that pickled tongue&mdash;it hain't
been touched&mdash;take some on't Elder Sniffles."</p>

<p>"I'm obliged to you, Mrs. Maguire&mdash;but I confess
I am somewhat fearful of taking articles of that description
upon my stomach, as they create a degree of
acidity which is incompatible with digestion. Is it
not so my young friend? You are undoubtedly prepared
to decide, as you are, I believe, pursuing the
study of the medical science."</p>

<p>"I think you are altogether mistaken, Elder Sniffles.
We should always take a due proportion of
acid with our food, in order to preserve the equilibrium
of the internal economy, and produce that degree of
effervescence which is necessary to a healthy secretion."</p>

<p>"Exactly. Your views of the subject is one which
never struck me before; it seems a very just one. I
will partake of the pickled tongue in consideration of
your remarks."</p>

<p>"Take a slice on't, Sister Bedott. You seem to
need some tongue to-day&mdash;you're oncommon still."</p>

<p>"What a musical man you be, brother Magwire!
but it strikes me when an indiwiddiwal has an opportunity
o' hearin' intellectible conversation they'd better

<!-- page 167 -->

keep still and improve it. Ain't it so, Elder
Sniffles?"</p>

<p>"A very just remark, Mrs. Bedott; and one which
has often occurred to my own mind."</p>

<p>"Take some more of the chicken pie, Elder Sniffles."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, my young friend; I will take nothing
more."</p>

<p>"What! you don't mean to give it up yet, I hope,
elder."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mr. Maguire, I assure you I would rather
not take any thing more, for as I before remarked, I
am decidedly opposed to excessive eating upon this
day."</p>

<p>"Well, then, we'll have the pies and puddins.
Jeff, my son, fly round and help your mar change the
plates. I'll take the puddin, Melissy&mdash;you may tend
to the pies. Jeff set on the cider. So here's a plum
puddin'&mdash;it looks nice&mdash;I guess you've had good-luck
to-day wife. Sister Bedott, you'll have some on't?"</p>

<p>"No; I'm obleeged to ye. I've got ruther of a
head-ache to-day, and plum puddin's rich. I guess
I'll take a small piece o' the punkin pie."</p>

<p>"Elder Sniffles, you'll be helped to some on't of
course?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mr. Maguire, the practice of indulging in
articles of this description after eating meat is esteemed
highly pernicious, and I inwardly protest against

<!-- page 168 -->

it; furthermore, as Mrs. Bedott has very justly remarked,
plum pudding is rich&mdash;however, considering
the peculiar circumstances of the occasion, I will for
once overstep the boundaries which I have prescribed
for myself."</p>

<p>"Am I to understand that you'll have some, or
not?"</p>

<p>"I will partake, in consideration of time and
place."</p>

<p>"Jimmeni! wife, this is good puddin' as I ever
eat."</p>

<p>"Elder Sniffles, will you take some o' the pie&mdash;here
is a mince pie and punkin pie."</p>

<p>"I will take a small portion of the pumpkin pie if
you please, Mrs. Maguire, as I consider it highly nutritious;
but, as regards the mince pie, it is an article
of food which I deem excessively deleterious to the
constitution, inasmuch as it is composed of so great
a variety of ingredients. I esteem it exceedingly
difficult of digestion. Is it not so my young friend?"</p>

<p>"By no means, elder; quite the contrary&mdash;and the
reason is obvious. Observe, elder&mdash;it is cut into the
most minute particles; hence it naturally follows, that
being, as it were, completely calcined before it enters
the system&mdash;it leaves, so to speak, no labor to be performed
by the digestive organs, and it is disposed of
without the slightest difficulty."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed! your reasoning is quite new to me&mdash;yet

<!--

"Desist! Mrs. Maguire, desist, I entreat you! I invariably set my face like a flint against the use of all
intoxicating liquors as a beverage." page 169.

-->

<!-- page 169 -->

I confess it to be most satisfactory and lucid. In
consideration of its facility of digestion I will partake
also of the mince pie."</p>

<p>"Wife, fill the elder a glass o' cider."</p>

<p>"Desist! Mrs. Maguire, desist, I entreat you! I invariably
set my face like a flint against the use of all
intoxicating liquors as a beverage."</p>

<p>"Jimmeni! you don't mean to call new cider an intoxicatin'
liquor, I hope. Why, man alive, it's jest
made&mdash;hain't begun to work."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I believe it to be exceedingly insalubrious,
and detrimental to the system. Is not that
its nature, my young friend?"</p>

<p>"Far from it, elder&mdash;far from it. Reflect a moment
and you will readily perceive, that being the pure
juice of the apple&mdash;wholly free from all alcoholic
mixture&mdash;it possesses all the nutritive properties of the
fruit, with the advantage of being in a more condensed
form, which at once renders it much more agreeable,
and facilitates assimilation."</p>

<p>"Very reasonable&mdash;very reasonable, indeed. Mrs.
Maguire you may fill my glass."</p>

<p>"Take another slice o' the puddin', Elder Sniffles."</p>

<p>"No more, I'm obliged to you, Mr. Maguire."</p>

<p>"Well, won't you be helped to some more o' the
pie?"</p>

<p>"No more, I thank you, Mr. Maguire."</p>

<!-- page 170 -->

<p>"But you'll take another glass o' cider, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"In consideration of the nutritious properties of
new cider, which your son has abundantly shown to
exist, I will permit you to replenish my glass."</p>

<p>"So you won't take nothin' more, elder?"</p>

<p>"Nothing more, my friends&mdash;nothing more whatsoever&mdash;for
as I have several times remarked during
the repast, I am an individual of exceedingly abstemious
habits&mdash;endeavoring to enforce by example
that which I so strenuously enjoin by precept from
the pulpit, to wit&mdash;temperance in all things."</p>

<p>"Walk into the sitting room, elder. Mother'll
have to excuse us for a while. Aunt Bedott, you'll
give us your company, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Sartainly."</p>

<p>"Father, are you not coming?"</p>

<p>"Not now, Jeff. I've got to go out for a spell.
I'll try to be in soon."</p>

<p>"Take this arm-cheer by the stove. Elder Sniffles&mdash;the
room's got ruther cool; Jefferson, can't you
accumelate the fire a little?"</p>

<p>"It strikes me very forcibly, Mrs. Bedott, that
the weather is somewhat cool for the season of the
year."</p>

<p>"So it strikes me tew; but I think this is quite a
cool climit&mdash;appearently considerably cooler 'n Wiggletown."</p>

<!-- page 171 -->

<p>"Why no, aunty&mdash;there can't be any difference in
the climate&mdash;the latitude's just the same."</p>

<p>"I guess not, Jeff&mdash;what <i>is</i> the latitude o' Scrabble
Hill?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's about forty-two."</p>

<p>"Lawful sakes! our'n in Wiggletown's as much
as fifty, and sometimes in the summer time it gits up
as high as sixty or seventy."</p>

<p>"Ah! indeed! you surprise me, Mrs. Bedott,
Speaking of Wiggletown&mdash;is that your place of
residence?"</p>

<p>"It is so&mdash;the place where the heft o' my life has
ben spent."</p>

<p>"In what section of the country is it located?"</p>

<p>"It's sitiwated between Ganderfield and Tuckertown,
Slammerkin' crick runs along the south side on't."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, I comprehend; I think I have an indiscriminate
recollection of the place. If I am not mistaken
I journeyed through it some two years since, in
company with my companion (now deceased), on a
visit to her relatives in that section."</p>

<p>"H-o-o-o! how you talk! that journey must be a
mellancolly subjick o' reflection now&mdash;how little you
thought then that in tew year you'd be called to
mourn her departer! how onsartin' the futur is!"</p>

<p>"True&mdash;a very just remark, Mrs. Bedott, very, indeed&mdash;we
are sojourners in a world of fluctuation!"</p>

<p>"O, Elder Sniffles&mdash;how true that is!"</p>

<!-- page 172 -->

<p>"One moment tossed on the billows of prosperity
and joy, and the next plunged into the abysses of
desperation and despair."</p>

<p>"O, Elder Sniffles, what a strikin' remark; every
word you say goes to the bottom o' my heart. I tew
mourn the loss of a pardner, and bein' as we're similarly
sittiwated, I feel as if we could sympathize with
one another. You hain't no children&mdash;I've got tew, but
they're married and settled, and I'm as good as alone
in the world. It's a tryin' sittiwation&mdash;very tryin'."</p>

<p>"It is <i>so</i>, Mrs. Bedott&mdash;your remark is a very just one&mdash;very,
indeed&mdash;your situation is undoubtedly a trying
one&mdash;but you are in easy circumstances, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, ginerally speakin' I be purty easy,
though sometimes I'm ruther <i>on</i>easy when I think
o' the futur&mdash;I was wonderfully struck with a remark
in your sarmon this mornin'&mdash;it described my feelins
so egzackly."</p>

<p>"Allow me to inquire what that remark was, Mrs.
Bedott?"</p>

<p>[The conversation is here interrupted by the entrance
of Mr. and Mrs. Maguire].</p>

<p>"Well, elder, how do you come on&mdash;time pass
agreeably?"</p>

<p>"Most agreeably, Mr. Maguire, most agreeably, in
conversation with Mrs. Bedott."</p>

<p>"Glad on't&mdash;Jeff, here's the last 'Luminary,' want
it? I've read it purty much all, exceptin' the poetry."</p>

<!-- page 173 -->

<p>"Does it contain a poem by 'Hugelina?' If so, permit
me to request you to favor us with it, my young
friend. She is indeed a most extraordinary writer."</p>

<p>"She is, that's a fact&mdash;Jeff, less have it."</p>

<p>[Jeff reads]&mdash;"Those of our readers who are in any
degree imbued with a love of the poetic&mdash;with an
appreciation of the sublime and beautiful&mdash;will find a
rich treat in the following exquisite lines from the pen
of our highly gifted correspondent 'Hugelina.' Aside
from the high degree of finish which her effusions
always possess, the ensuing lines breathe a spirit of
world-weariness and self-abandonment exceedingly
touching.</p>

<p>"O don't ax me&mdash;I can't make head, nor tail on't&mdash;what's
your opinion, Jefferson?"</p>

<p>"Well, I think that the obscurity of which Elder
Sniffles complains constitutes the greatest beauty of
the poem. Don't you know, elder, we are never
deeply interested in any thing that we can comprehend
at the first glance. There must be some mystery,
some <i>hidden meaning</i> to excite at once our curiosity
and admiration&mdash;Shakespeare himself often writes
obscurely, you know."</p>

<p>"Shakespeare! that is an author that I am not
conversant with. What does he principally treat
of?"</p>

<p>"O, theology, and metaphysics, and so forth."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, I recollect now&mdash;I think I have seen
some of his sermons. On consideration, your reasoning
in relation to the poem strikes me as quite conclusive.
There should be&mdash;as you very justly remark&mdash;a
hidden meaning to create an interest in any
thing of that description."</p>

<p>"Well, then, that poitry must be awful interestin',
for all the meanin' ther is in't is <i>hid</i>, and no mistake&mdash;don't
you say so, husband?"</p>

<p>"O, I ain't no judge o' poitry&mdash;ax sister Bedott,
she knows all about poitry, writes bags on't."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed! is it true, Mrs. Bedott, that you cultivate
the poetic art?"</p>

<p>"Well, <i>'tain't for me to say.</i>"</p>

<i>shall</i> I dew! I wouldent a had you heerd that song
for no money! I wish I hadent a come! I wish to
gracious I hadent a come!"</p>

<p>"I assure you, Mrs. Bedott, it was unintentional on
my part, entirely unintentional, but my contiguity to
yourself, and your proximity to me, were such as rendered
it impossible for me to avoid hearing you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, it can't be helped now, it's no use cryin' for
spilt milk, but I wouldent hev you to think I know'd
<i>you</i> ever come here."

<p>"On the contrary, this grove is a favorite resort of

<!-- page 177 -->

mine; it affords a congenial retreat after the exterminating
and tremendous mental labors of the day. I
not unfrequently spend the declining hours of the
evening here, buried in the most profound meditation.
On your entrance, I was occupying my customary seat
beneath that umbrageous mounting ash which you
perceive a few feet from you: indeed, had not your
mind been much pre-occupied, you could scarcely have
avoided discovering me."</p>

<p>"O, granf'ther grievous! I wish I'd a stayed to hum!
I was born for misfortin' and nothin' else! I wish to
massy I'd a stayed to hum to-night! but I felt as if
I'd like to come here once afore I leave the place."
[She weeps.]</p>

<p>"Ah! indeed! do you project leaving Scrabble
Hill?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I dew, I calklate to go next week. I must hear
you preach once more&mdash;<i>once</i> more, elder, and then I'm
agwine&mdash;somewher&mdash;I don't care where, nor I don't
care what becomes o' me when I git there." [She
sobs violently.]</p>

<p>"O, Mrs. Bedott, you distress me beyond limitation&mdash;permit
me to inquire the cause of this uncontrollable
agony?"</p>

<p>"O, Elder Sniffles, you're the last indiwiddiwal
that ought to ax such a question. O, I <i>shall</i> die! I
<i>shall</i> give it up!"</p>

<p>"Madam, my interest in your welfare is intense, allow

<!-- page 178 -->

me to entreat you still more vehemently to unburden
your mind, perhaps it is in my power to relieve
you."</p>

<p>"Relieve me! what an idee! O, elder, you <i>will</i> be
the death o' me if you make me revulge my feelins so.
An hour ago, I felt as if I'd a' died afore I'd a said
what I hev said now, but you've draw'd it out o' me."</p>

<p>"Respected madam; you have as yet promulged
nothing satisfactory, permit me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, granf'ther grievous! must I come to't! well
then, if I must, I must, so to begin at the beginnin'.
When I fust heern you preach, your sarmons onsettled
my faith; but after a spell I was convinced by
yer argefyin', and gin up my 'roneus notions, and my
mind got considerable carm. But how could I set
Sabberday after Sabberday under the droppin's o' yer
voice, and not begin to feel a mor'n ordinary interest
in the speaker? I indevored not tew, but I couldent
help it; 'twas in vain to struggle against the feelins
that prepossest my buzzom. But it's all over with
me now! my felicitude is at an eend! my sittiwation
is hopeless! I shall go back to Wiggletown next
week and never truble you no more."</p>

<p>"Ah, Mrs. Bedott, you alarm&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, you never'll see no more trouble with Prissilly.
I'm agwine back to Wiggleton. Can't bear to
go back there nother, on account o' the indiwiddiwals
that I come away to git rid of. There's Cappen

<!-- page 179 -->

Canoot, he's always been after me ever since my husband
died, though I hain't never gin him no incurridgement&mdash;but
he won't take no for an answer. I
dread the critter's attentions. And Squire Bailey&mdash;he's
wonderful rich&mdash;but that ain't no recommendation
to me, and I've told him so time and agin, but I s'pose
he thinks I'll come round bumby. And Deacon
Crosby, he lost his pardner a spell afore I come away,
he was very much pleased with me, he's a wonderful
fine man&mdash;make a fust rate husband. I kind o' hesitated
when he promulgated his sentiments tew me,
told him I'd think on't till I come back&mdash;s'pose he'll
be at me as soon as I git there. I hate to disappoint
Deacon Crosby, he's such a fine man, and my dezeased
companion sot so much by him, but then I don't feel
for him, as I dew for&mdash;&mdash;. He's a Presbyterian tew,
and I don't think 'twould be right to unite my destination
to hisen."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly in your present state of feeling, the
uncongeniality would render a union&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, dear, dear, dear! I can't bear to go back there
and indure their attentions, but thank fortune, they
won't bother me long&mdash;I shall go into a decline, I
know I shall, as well as I want to know it. My troubles'll
soon be over&mdash;ondoubtedly they'll put up a
monnyment to my memory&mdash;I've got the discription
all ready for't&mdash;it says,

<!-- page 180 -->

<p>Here sleeps Prissilly P. Bedott,<br/>

Late relic of Hezekier,<br/>

How mellancolly was her lot!<br/>

How soon she did expire!</p>

<p>She didn't commit self-suicide,<br/>
'Twas tribbilation killed her,<br/>

O, what a pity she hadn't a died,<br/>

Afore she saw the elder!&mdash;</p>

<p>And O, elder, you'll visit my grave, won't ye, and
shed tew or three tears over it? 'Twould be a consolation
tew me to think you would."</p>

<p>"In case I should ever have occasion to journey
thro' that section of country, and could consistently
with my arrangements make it convenient to tarry for
a short time at Wiggletown, I assure you it would afford
me much pleasure to visit your grave agreeably
to your request."</p>

<p>"O, elder, how onfeelin'!"</p>

<p>"Unfeeling! did I not understand you correctly
when I understood you to request me to visit your
grave?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I don't see how you can be so carm,
when I'm a talkin' about dyin'."</p>

<p>"I assure you, Mrs. Bedott, I had not the slightest
intention of manifesting a want of feeling in my remark.
I should regard your demise as a most deplorable
event, and it would afford me no small degree of
satisfaction to prevent so melancholy a catastrophe
were it in my power."</p>

<!-- page 181 -->

<p>"Well, I guess I'll go hum. If Sally should
know you was here a talkin' with me, she'd make an
awful fuss."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I see no reason to fear that my domestic
should interfere in any of my proceedings."</p>

<p>"O, lawful sakes! how numb you be, elder! I
dident illude to Sal Blake&mdash;I meant Sal Hugle, she't
you're ingaged tew."</p>

<p>"Engaged to Miss Hugle! you alarm me, Mrs.
Be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now don't undertake to deny it, elder; every
body says it's a fact."</p>

<p>"Well, then, it only remains for me to assert that
every body is laboring under an entire and unmitigated
mistake."</p>

<p>"You don't say so, elder! well, I declare I dew feel
relieved. I couldent indure the idee o' stayin' here
to see that match go off. She's so onworthy&mdash;so different
from what your companion had ought to be&mdash;and
so lazy&mdash;and makes such awful poitry; and then
she hain't worth a cent in the world. But I don't
want to say a word aginst her; for if you ain't ingaged
now, mabby you will be. O, elder! promise
me, dew promise me how't you won't marry that
critter. 'T would be a consolation tew me when I'm
fur away on my dyin' bed, to know&mdash;" [she weeps
with renewed energy] "O, elder, I'm afreard I'm
a gwine to hev the highsterics. I'm subjick to

<!-- page 182 -->

spasmatic affections when I'm excited and overcome."</p>

<p>"You alarm me, Mrs. Bedott! I will hasten to the
house, and bring the sal volatile, which may restore
you."</p>

<p>"For the land's sake, elder, don't go after Sal; she
can't dew nothing for me. It'll only make talk, for
she'll tell it all round the village. Jest take that are
newspaper that sticks out o' yer pocket, and fan me
with it a leetle. There&mdash;I feel quite resusticated.
I'm obleeged tew ye; guess I can manage to git hum
now." [She rises.]</p>

<p>"Farewell, Elder Sniffles! adoo! we part to meet
no more!"</p>

<p>"Ah, Mrs. Bedott! do not speak in that mournful
strain; you distress me beyond all mitigation&mdash;" [he
takes her hand] "pray reseat yourself, and allow me
to prolong the conversation for a short period. As I
before observed, your language distresses me beyond
all duration."</p>

<p>"Dew you actilly feel distressed at the idee o' partin'
with me?"</p>

<p>"Most indubitably, Mrs. Bedott."</p>

<p>"Well, then, what's the use o' partin' at all? O,
what <i>hev</i> I said! what <i>hev</i> I said!"

<p>"Ahem&mdash;ahaw! allow me to inquire&mdash;are you in
easy circumstances, Mrs. Bedott?"</p>

<!-- page 183 -->

<p>"Well, not intirely, yet; though I feel considerable
easier 'n what I did an hour ago."</p>

<p>"Ahem! I imagine that you do not fully apprehend
my meaning. I am a clergyman&mdash;a laborer in the
vineyard of the Lord&mdash;as such you will readily understand
I can not be supposed to abound in the filthy
lucre of this world; my remuneration is small&mdash;hence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, elder, how can you s'pose I'd hesitate on account
o' your bein' poor? Don't think on't&mdash;it only
increases my opinion of you; money ain't no objick
to me."</p>

<p>"I naturally infer from your indifference respecting
the amount of my worldly possessions, that you yourself
have&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be oneasy, elder, dear&mdash;don't illude tew it
again; depend on't you're jest as dear to me, every
bit and grain, as you would be if you owned all the
mines of Ingy."</p>

<p>"I will say no more about it."</p>

<p>"So I s'pose we're engaged."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly."</p>

<p>"We're ingaged, and my tribbilation is at an end."
[Her head droops on his shoulder.] "O, Shadrack!
what will Hugelina say when she hears on't?"</p>

<h3>XVIII.</h3>

<h3>The Widow Writes to her Daughter, Mrs.
Jupiter Smith.</h3>

</div>

<p>DEAR MELISSY:&mdash;</p>

<p>I NOW take my pen in hand to tell you that I
ruther guess you'll be considerably astonished
when you read what I set down to rite. I've got
some news to tell, that you can't guess if you try till
next never, so you may as well give it up furst as last
afore you begin. And you ain't to let on a word
about it only to Jubiter and Kier and Seliny. Come
to think, I don't care if you tell Sam Pendergrasses
wife, bein' as how she's a partickler friend o' mine.</p>

<p>But don't you open yer head about it to no other
indiwiddiwal&mdash;for I want to supprise the Wiggletown
folks, and make 'em open ther eyes a leetle. Come
to considder, I guess you'd better not tell Miss Pendergrass,
for I'm afeard she can't keep it to herself.
She might let it out to the Kenipes, and they'd tell
the Crosbys, and the Crosbys they'd carry it strait to
Major Coon's wife, and she'd be sure to tell old Dawson's
wife (the widder Jinkins that was&mdash;she 'twas

<!-- page 185 -->

Poll Bingham), and she's the verry undentical person
I want to keep it from till it busts upon her all of a
sudding, like a thunder-clap. I guess I'll let her
know't I can hold my head as high as hern in futur,
for who did she git but a decrippid old bung head
that she wouldent a had if she could a got any body
else. I guess on the hull you hadent better say nothin'
about it to Kier's wife, for fear she'll tell her folks,
and they'll sartinly devulgate it all round. If you
dew tell her, you make her promise she won't tint a
sillyble about it to her step-mother&mdash;she 'twas Kesier
Winkle&mdash;nor to nobody else. You must all keep it a
perfound secret till I come. If nothin' happens to
pervent, we shall be in Wiggletown next week, a
Saturday, on our bridal tewer. A Sunday mornin'
we calkilate to go to meetin' along a you and Jubiter,
and in the afternoon we shall tend the Baptist meetin'.
I tell ye won't ther be some starin' in Wiggletown
that day. I guess they'll find out that I'm as good
as enny on 'em if not a leetle better. I shan't hev on
none o' the things they've ever seen me wear. My
riggin's to be intirely new. Yer Uncle Magwire has
made me a present of a hansome green merino dress,
and yer Aunt Magwire has gi'n me a new brown
velvet bunnit, and yer Cousin Jefferson has presented
me an elegant plaid shawl, and I calkilate to come out
in 'em all in Wiggletown.</p>

<p>Speakin' o' my new wardrobes, reminds me to tell

<!-- page 186 -->

you that if Jabe Clark comes your way a peddlin',
not to trade a cent's woth with him. You remember
how he come it over me about the shoes, don't ye?
Well it's amazin' I should ever be such a fool as to
be took in by him agin&mdash;but so 'twas. He come
along here a spell ago, and sarved me the awfullest
trick that ever you heerd on. I was alone in the house&mdash;yer
aunt had went to a sick nabor's, and the way he
cheated me was perfectly dretful. My blud biles now
a thinkin' on't. He pretended he'd experienced religion,
and lamented over the way he used to cheat
and lie; and as true as I live and breathe, actilly got
round me so't he preswaded me to swop away an elegant
stun colored silk, that cost me a dollar a yard,
for a miserable slazy stripid consarn, that he said was
all the fashion now&mdash;called it "grody flewry"&mdash;and
what makes it more aggravatin' made me pay tew dollars
to boot. But that wa'n't the wost on't, for come
to onroll it, we found that three or four yards away
at t'other eend on't was all dammidged and stained
up&mdash;'twa'n't fit for nothing. Yer aunt was mad at
me for bein' so took in, and yer uncle he lafft and
hectored me and went on about it&mdash;you know what a
critter he is to bother a boddy. At last I busted out
a cryin', and went off and shot myself up in my room,
and stayed there till tea time&mdash;and when I come down,
lo and behold, yer uncle stept up and handed me a
new green merino dress&mdash;he'd ben off to the store

<!-- page 187 -->

and bought it a purpose for me, fringe, and buttons
and every thing to trim it with, and I've got it made
up, and it sets like a dandy&mdash;and I'm gwine to be
married in it. But I can't help feelin' awfully gauled
about the silk. I took it to Parker and Pettibone's and
swoppt it for some things I wanted. They wouldent
allow me but eighteen pence a yard, and 'twas all
'twas woth. Jabe made me take a couple o' hankerchers
tew, for a dollar a piece&mdash;said he'd stake his
repertation on't they wa'n't half cotton&mdash;and no more
they wa'n't, for come to dew 'em up, they showed out
plain enuff that they was all cotton&mdash;did you ever?
He got round the elder tew&mdash;made him pay five dollars
for a buzzum pin&mdash;said 'twas topiz sot in gold,
and it turned out to be yaller glass with a pinchback
rim round it. I was clear out o' pashence with the
elder for bein' so green&mdash;but sittiwated as I was I
couldent say nothin' ye know. If ever I come acrost
Jabe Clark agin, if he don't ketch it, no matter. But
I'm wonderful bizzy about these days&mdash;and so no
more at present from your affectionate mother,</p>

<p>PRISSILLA P. BEDOTT.</p>

<p>P. S. Give my love to Jubiter. I'm gratified to
hear that the baby is so forrard. What do you calkilate
to call him? I hope it won't be Jubiter&mdash;for
somehow I don't egzactly like the name, tho' it sounds
well for a man. But don't in all favor name him arter

<!-- page 188 -->

yer par. Hezekier's an awful name. How do ye
like Shadrack? That's the name o' his grandfather
that's to be. Yer uncle and aunt and Jeff sends
love. P. P. B.</p>

<p>P. S. Yer cousin, Jeff axed permission to read this
letter, and he says I hain't told you who I'm gwine
to be married tew, nor when, the weddin's to be,
nor nothin'. But 'tain't to be wondered at that I
forgot, for I've got such a numerous number o' things
to think on now. My future companion is the
Baptist minister o' this place&mdash;by the name o' Elder
Sniffles. The way we come acquainted was quite
singular. You see I took to attendin' his meetin'
because the Presbyterian minister here is such small
potaters that 'twa'n't eddifyin' for me to set under his
preachin', and understandin' that Elder Sniffles was a
very gifted man I thought I'd go to hear him.
Well, I liked him wonderful well, he's a powerful
speaker and his prayers is highly interestin'. So I
goes to hear him a number o' times. He obsarved
me and was' evidently pleased with me&mdash;but during
all the time I was creatin' such a sensation in his
feelins I never knowd but what he had a wife. How
I <i>did</i> feel when I found out he was a widdiwer. I
was dretfully flustrated, and kep myself as scarce as
possible. But he follered me up and parsevered, till
at last I consented to accept o' him. It's mellancolly

<!-- page 189 -->

to be alone in the world, and then ministers don't
grow on every bush. The weddin' is to take place
next week a Wensday evenin' at yer uncle's. Elder
Yawpers, from Slabtown, is to reform the ceremony
and preach in Elder Sniffleses place the next Sabbath
when we're gone.</p>

<p>The elder lives in a gamble rufft yallar house. I
mean to make him put wings to't and make it look
ruther more fashionable. It stans on a descendin'
elevation that slants down to the canawl on the one
side, and not fur behind it is a morantic grove. He
hain't no family but a little highty tighty gal that they
brought up. I tell ye if I don't make her stan' round
when I get there I'm mistaken. We shall start for
Wiggletown a Thursday, in the stage&mdash;and git there,
I s'pose, Saturday evenin'. Now Melissy Smith remember
you're to keep it a profound secret. I don't
want nobody in Wiggletown to know a word about
it till 'they see us come a walkin' into meetin'. If you
anser this afore we come, direct to the Reverend Mrs.
Sniffles.</p>

<p>Your affectionate mar, P. P. BEDOTT,<br/>
(till next week).</p>

<p>P. S. I've writ an elegy on my marriage that Jeff
thinks is one o' my best poims. He's gwine to send
it to be printed in the "Scrabble Hill Luminary," right
under the marriage notice. He's a keepin' it from

<!-- page 190 -->

his par and mar, cause they hain't no sense o' poitry&mdash;yer
aunt espeshelly, has always disencurridged my
writin' for the papers. But she can't help herself. P. P. B.</p>

<h3>XIX.</h3>

<h3>The Rev. Mrs. Sniffles Abroad.</h3>

</div>

<p>LEFT Scrabble Hill this mornin' in the stage for
Libertyille. Felt like death about leavin' my
beloved companion, but he insisted on't; said 'twould
be onpleasant for me to stay to hum while the parsonage
was undergwine repairs; and, besides the
journey'd be for my health; so at last I yealded to
conformity and went. 'Twas determined I should
visit the Crippinses, at Libertyville&mdash;Mrs. Crippin bein'
my husband's cousin.</p>

<p>The mornin was derlicious, and Aurory shone with
undiminished lusture. The feathered songsters wobbled
in the groves; the breezes was ladened with the
fragrance of ten thousand flowers, while natur seemed
to vie with creation to render the scene one of unmitigated
splendor. But I scercely noticed it a bit; for I
wa'n't in a sittiwation to enjoy it a mite. Alas! my
hull soul was with Shadrack.</p>

<p>Ther wa'n't but tew individiwals besides me in the
stage, and they was men folks. I should a found the

<!-- page 192 -->

journey awful tejus if I hadent amused myself by
courtin' the muses, as Shadrack calls it. I had a pencil
and a piece o' paper in my ridicule, and I axed one
o' the gentlemen to lend me his hat to write on. He
handed it out very perlitely, and I composed the follerin'
stanzys:</p>

<div class="center">

<p>TO MY OWN ONE.</p>

</div>

<p>Farewell to Scrabble Hill!<br/>

Farewell to my dear Shad!<br/>

I leave you much against my will,<br/>

And so I feel quite bad.</p>

<p>O Shadrack think o' me<br/>

When I am far away;<br/>

I sartingly shall think o' thee<br/>

Wherever I do stray.</p>

<p>Adoo! a fond adoo!<br/>

Dear pardner o' my heart.<br/>

The idee o' comin' back to you<br/>

Sustains me while we part.</p>

<p>O if my Shad should be<br/>

Onwell while I'm from home,<br/>

I shall feel most onpleasantlee,<br/>

And wish I hadn't a come.</p>

<p>But I will hope and pray<br/>

That we may both be able<br/>

To meet agin some futur day,<br/>

Alive and comfor<i>table</i>.</p>

<p>Every thing conspired to remind me of my absent
one. The men that was my feller passengers smoked
the heft o' the time. My Shadrack loves his pipe, and
it does me so much good to see him enjoy it. The indiwiddiwal

<!-- page 193 -->

that lent me his hat brought him very forcibly
to my mind. He was drest in black, and had a
wonderful dignified and thoughtful cast of expression.
I made up my mind he was a clargyman as soon as I
sot eyes on him; so when I handed back his hat I
ventured to inquire where his field o' labor was. He
hem'd and haw'd, and seem'd ruther imbarrised, So I
says, says I, "I s'pose I ain't mistaken in takin' you
for a clargyman?"</p>

<p>But afore he had time to answer, t'other one&mdash;he
was quite a young man&mdash;spoke up, and says he,
"You're right, marm&mdash;it's the Reverend Mr. Beadle,
of Punkin Hook."</p>

<p>"And this is my principal deacon, Mr. Snobs,"
says Mr. Beadle.</p>

<p>So I told 'em who I was; and after the ice was
broke, we had considerable interestin' conversation on
a number o' tropics, espeshealy on the state o' religion
in this section, particklarly in our respectable places
of abode. They seem'd wonderful grieved at the inikity
that prevails in our midst. Informed me that
they'd jest ben attendin' a convention to suppress the
railroads runnin' a Sabberdays. They never travel'd
on't, cause it dident lay by a Sabberdays.</p>

<p>They seem'd to be very much interested in me. I
show'd 'em the poetry I'd ben writin' which they was
wonderfully struck with. Brother Beadle proposed
settin' on't to music, and all on us singin' it together.

<!-- page 194 -->

<p>The deacon thought 'twould go in "Away with mellancolly:"
but not bein' conversant with that tune, I
proposed "Haddam"&mdash;a great favorite o' mine. They
said they'd amost forgot Haddam; so I sung one stanzy
to show 'em how it went, and then we all put to
and sung it together. They dident make out very
well I dident think; dident keep no time; seem'd to
be what Jeff Magwire calls <i>independent singers</i>, that is,
each one went intirely on his own hook, without payin'
no attention to the rest. But no doubt they done
the best they could, and I hadent ought to find fault.</p>

<p>The deacon requested me to give him the poim, in
order to have it printed in the "Punkin Hook Patriot
and Journal." After some hesitation I consented.</p>

<p>At Punkin Hook my interestin' feller travelers got
out. I regretted partin', and so did they. I invited
Brother Beadle to come to Scrabble Hill and preach
for us sometime. He squeezed my hand, and said he
was delighted to have met with such a sister in Israel&mdash;he
never should forget the refreshin' season he'd
enjoyed in my society.</p>

<p>The rest o' the way to Libertyville I was the only
passenger; but 'twa'n't no great distance. Jest as the
horrizon was sinkin' behind the western skies, I arriv
at Cousin Crippinses. When I told 'em who I was
they received me with open arms, for they set a great
deal by the elder. They're olderly people, very well
off; hain't no family but a son and daughter, both

<!-- page 195 -->

married and settled. The daughter lives in the same
place, is married to a risin' doctor by the name o'
Briggs. In short, I think I should be quite contented
here if my beloved companion was only with me.
But the accumulatin' shadders o' night, aggravated by
the descendin' of my candle into the socket, warns me
that it is time to seek my piller, and resusticate exausted
nater by repose.</p>

<p>O for a sight o' Shadrack's face,<br/>

To shine amid the gloom!<br/>

To mitigate this lonesome place,<br/>

And shed a sweet perfume.</p>

<p>WED-NIGHT.&mdash;Agin I take my pen in hand to record
the occurrences that have occurred durin' the day.
I riz at an arly hour, and sallied forth into Cousin
Crippinses garding to view the works of natur. O
how it expends and illuminates the religious affections
to contemplate the wonders of creation. The pinies
was all in full blow, and the yallar lilies riz up strait
and stiff to court the revigoratin' atmosphere. Also
the cabbidge leaves was a glitterin' with dew drops,
and looked like ever so many fans kivered with spangles.
My hull soul was evaporatin' with delightful
meditation, when cousin Crippin blowd the horn for
breakfast, and I was obleeged to go in, though I'd ten
times ruther a stayed there than to eat. Cousin Crippin
sets a tolerable good table&mdash;makes fust rate coffy,
though I must say I can beat her on griddle cakes;

<!-- page 196 -->

wonder whether she spunges 'em over night: don't believe
she does; can't have good griddle cakes without
spungin' 'em, accordin' to my way o' thinkin'.</p>

<p>This afternoon Cousin Crippinses daughter, Mrs.
Briggs, she 'twas Susan Ann Crippin, called on me;
ruther an ornary looking woman, but quite ginteel
and intellectible. The Crippinses had told me so
much about her that I was prepared to be wonderfully
struck up with her. She writes poetry for the
"Libertyville Reflector." She invited me to attend a
literary swearee at her sittiwation to-morrer evenin'.
She says they hold their swearees once a fortnight, and
she thinks they have a great attendancy to elevate the
tone o' society, and axed if we had any such thing at
Scrabble Hill. I told her no, that they was pretty
high strung ther already, and dident need nothin' to
elevate their tone. She smiled at this observation,
and remarked that I was rather sarcastical.</p>

<p>She said they dident admit none to membership
without they'd had something printed; but others
was sometimes invited to attend and enjoy the benefit
of the intellectible feast. And they'd be happy to
see me. I'd have the pleasure o' meetin' a number of
literary charicters; among 'em "Nell Nox," the celebrated
critic, and "Kate Kenype," the well-known
and greatly admired advocate of women. She presumed
I'd heerd of 'em both. "Nell Nox" was very
severe, very sarcastical, very, indeed. I told her I'd

<!-- page 197 -->

a number o' poims printed myself. She lookt quite
surprised, and I confess I was surprisder yet that she
hadent seen or heerd o' my pieces in the "Scrabble
Hill Luminary." On the hull, I was rather disappointed
in Cousin Briggs. But I mean to go to that
swearee any how, if nothin' happens. But we're
poor short sighted mortals.</p>

<p>Poor ignorant critters we!<br/>

To our short-sighted race<br/>

Things futur in life's mystery<br/>

And like enough never'll take place.</p>

<p>FRIDAY.&mdash;Last night attended the literary swearee
at Cousin Briggses, and was highly intertained. Ther
was ten or a dozen present, and four on 'em had original
productions. The most extinguished article was
the Widder Reade's. She signs her perductions
"Nell Nox." She's a very fleshy woman, with a
wonderful small head. I took particular notice of
her 'cause she's so notorious in a literary point o'
view. She had a singlar lookin' head-dress stuck atop
of her head. Her nose is awful long, and turns up
at the eend; very handy, saves her the trouble o'
turnin' on't it up every time she reads a poor piece o'
poetry, and she don't seem to read no other exceptin'
Cousin Briggses. She was drest in a sky blue muslin
dress with flounces almost up to her waist, that made
her look shorter and fleshyer than she actilly was,
She had a dretful severe critisism on the American

<!-- page 198 -->

poits, espeshially a certing long-feller, as she called him,
some tall indiwidiwal I s'pose. She cut him all to
pieces, declaring that he had never writ a line that
could be call poitry in all his born days. She said
that his Eve Angeline was a perfectly nonsensical
humbug. I presume that's some young woman he's
ingaged to. I thought if she was a mind to whale
away aginst the long-feller she might, but she might a let
his intended alone. Cousin Susan Ann axed me afterwards
if I dident think Nell Nox was awful cuttin'.
She said <i>she</i> shouldent like to come under her lash.
She wondered what long-feller'd say when he come to
see that critisism, as he ondoubtedly would, for
'twould come out in "The Reflector" afore long; Nell
contribbits to that paper. Thinks me I ain't afeared of
her; I guess she'll change her sentiments when she
hears my piece. She'll think ther is such a thing as
poitry in Ameriky then. For I had in my pocket the
stanzys I writ in the stage&mdash;I'd brought 'em along,
thinkin' like enough I should be called on to read
something.</p>

<p>The editor of "The Reflector" was there; he's president
of the swearees. A wonderful small, jandery-lookin'
young man, with blazin' red hair, and exceedinly
pompous, but oncommon talented. He had an
article on the prospects of the literary horizon throughout
the world. His sentiments differed from Nell
Noxes inasmuch as he held that Ameriky was the

<!-- page 199 -->

only country where poitry had reached the hight of
its zenith. To prove it, he brought forrard Cousin
Briggses writins, said that even Nell Nox, the severest
critic of the age, spared <i>her;</i> ther wa'n't nothing in
her poitry that no critic could git hold of. He wound
up, at last, by glorifyin', in a most eloquent manner,
that both o' these remarkable writers were contribbitors
to his paper.</p>

<p>Next come Cousin Susan Ann Briggs with her article.
'Twas a very affectin' poim on the death o' Deacon
Paine's daughter. I don't' remember but one stanzy,
and that come in at the eend of every alternative
verse. It runs thus:</p>

<p>Fond parents weep for me no more,<br/>

That I no more am given;<br/>

We'll surely shall meet when life is ore,<br/>

High up above in heaven.</p>

<p>I must ax Cousin Briggs for a coppy on't, it's very
good, though I actilly think I can beat it; 'tain't for
me to say so, however. Her newspaper name is
"Fenella Fitzallen."</p>

<p>The last indiwidiwal that read was an olderly young
woman, named Samanthy Hocum, a wonderful tall,
slab-sided, coarse lookin' critter. Her hair looked
singular, 'twas all raked back off her forrard, and
made her phizmahogany look amazin' broad and
brazen; She certainly was oncommon odd and ornary
lookin'. Had on a red calico dress, and a queer kind

<!-- page 200 -->

of a bobtailed little thing, made o' green silk, with
brass buttons down it. Take her altogether, she was
about as singular a critter in her appearance as I've
seen in some time. But she's oncommon smart. She
had an article on the subject o' "Woman's Rights."
'Twas a powerful perduction. She hild that the men
hadent no bizness to monopolize every thing, and
trammil the female sect. I thought to myself they
hadent showed no great disposition to <i>trammil</i> her so
far. She writes for the "Pidgin Pint Record of
Genius," and signs Kate Kenype.</p>

<p>Them was all the articles that was read last night,
though ther was several more literary indiwidiwals
ther. A fat, pudden-faced young man that writes
poetry for the "Newville Star and Trumpet," and
signs "Phil Philpotts." And then ther was a ruther
good lookin' young woman that writes the amusin'
articles for the same paper, and signs 'em "Betsy Buttertub,"
and some more, but I disremember their newspaper
names.</p>

<p>After the readin' was over, the company diverted
the time till the refreshments come in to walkin' round
and round through the foldin' doors to the hall, and
then from the hall through the foldin' doors agin, as
if ther lives depended on't. The editor, he walked
with Nell Nox, and Phil Philpotts with Betsy Buttertub,
and Kate Kenype, she stramanaded round alone,
wonderful independent. I sot on the sofy and talked

<!-- page 201 -->

to the Briggses till I got as dizzy as a fool, seein' 'em
go round and round. I wanted to read my poim, and
I seed plainly that Cousin Susan Ann dident mean to
ax me to (shouldent wonder if she was a little jealous).
So I determined I would read it whether or no; so
when the company sot down to take refreshment, I
speaks up and  says, that seein' I'd ben so eddified
myself; I thought I'd ought to contribute my share to
the evenin's intertainment; and then without furder
ado, I takes out my piece and reads it. 'Twas very
much admired. Nell Nox declared 'twas what <i>she</i>
called poitry, and the editor requested a coppy on't to
put in "The Reflector." I gi'n it tew him. It dident
strike me till after I got hum that I'd gi'n it the
Reverend Mr. Beadle, to be printed in the "Punkin
Hook Patriot and Journal." So I s'pose the tew
papers'll be accusin' one another o' stealin' on't, and
there'll be a reglar newspaper quarril about it; and
I shall be drawn into public notice in a manner very
imbarrassin' to my retirin' disposition. But I can't
help it. We literary characters must expect to be
subjected to a great many more onpleasant things than
falls to the lot o' privit indiwidiwals&mdash;it's the fate o'
genius.</p>

<p>Don't know but what I'd try git up a Literary
Swearee Society in Scrabble Hill, if I dident s'pose
Sally Hugle'd make herself so conspickiwous in it.
But I know she would. She's so awful vain, and

<!-- page 202 -->

thinks herself such an amazin' poitess, though as to
that, every body knows she can't write. I feel kinder
sorry for her, she mistakes her calling so. I should
lament to have her make such a laffin' stock of herself,
as she would if ther was any literary dewins there.</p>

<p>SATURDAY EVENING.&mdash;Larnt to-day, through Dr.
Briggs, and by a long chain o' circumstances tew numerous
to be detailed here; that the indiwidiwals that
past themselves off for a clargyman and deacon in the
stage, was nothing but a couple of hoss dealers from
Varmount, with no more sense o' religion than the
animals they trade in. O, 'tis mellancoly! I feel to
lament that human natur should be sunk to such a
turrible a pitch as to deceave a reverend lady so awfully.
I pitty the poor degraded, deluded critters
from the bottom o' my heart. I hope they may
have grace and space to repent. To think o' my bein'
so took in! Well, they'll have it to answer for,
that's a comfort. But I hope they'll be led to see
ther sinfulness afore it's tew late. To think o' my
lettin' 'em have my poitry tew, that galls me. I wish
they'd steal some hosses and be took up and sent to
the states prison, the miserable wretches&mdash;but I forgive
'em&mdash;I always forgive&mdash;I never lay up nothing
aginst nobody&mdash;the consarnid critters!</p>

<p>To-morrer'll be Sunday&mdash;intend to go to meetin'
if I can command my feelins sufficient. But ondoubtedly

<!-- page 203 -->

I shall be all day a counterastin' the preacher
with my companion, and so sha'n't enjoy my mind,
and have as refreshin' a season as I otherways should.</p>

<p>Agin the sacred day<br/>

Of sacred rest has come,<br/>

And to my inmost feelins brings<br/>

My Shadrack's image hum.</p>

<p>I'd rather spend the day<br/>

With him than where I am,<br/>

A hearin' of him preach and pray,<br/>

And givin' out the psalm.</p>

<h3>The Rev. Mrs. Sniffles at Home.</h3>

</div>

<p>"I MUST show ye my daggertype, sister Magwire,
that I had took while I was gone."</p>

<p>"I want to know if you've got one o' them things!
I've heerd about 'em, and had a great curiosity to see
'em. Pray how do they take 'em?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell ye. Sal! Sal Blake, come in here!
Why don't ye never start some time or other when I
call ye? You go up stairs to my chamber, and fetch
here that thing kivered with morocker, that lies on
the stand. Step quick, you&mdash;and don't ye be gone
longer 'n till next day after to-morrer, if ye can help
it. And here! don't you open it&mdash;you fetch it right
straight along down&mdash;d'ye hear. That young one
does try my patience the worst way&mdash;she's the slowest
o' all created critters. I don't b'leve it done her any
good stayin' with you while we was gone. I wish
the elder'd a sent her to the Widder Grimeses&mdash;I
guess she'd a made her fly round. I don't s'pose you
trained her a mite."</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't see no occasion for it. She seemed

<!-- page 205 -->

willin' enough to dew without drivin'. And besides,
I don't approve o' workin' half-grown gals so hard as
some folks dew. It stunts 'em, and injures their constitutions."</p>

<p>"I declare, if that ain't a bright idee! jist as if&mdash;As
true as natur, there she comes! What's got into
ye, Sal, to make ye so spry all of a sudding? I guess
ye seen a ghost on the stairway, didn't ye? There
Sister Magwire, isn't that strikin'? Sal, you huzzy!
where's yer manners? don't ye know no better'n to
be a gawpin' over Miss Magwire's shoulders? go into
the kitchin&mdash;budge!"</p>

<p>"Why Sister Sniffles, dew let the poor child look
at it&mdash;what harm'll it dew?"</p>

<p>"Sister Magwire, I wish you wouldn't interfere in
my domestic arrangements&mdash;Sal, you put for the
kitchin, and finish pearin' them apples and when
ye've got 'em done, take hold and scour them pans&mdash;and
don't ye stop to look out o' the winder&mdash;and as
soon as ye git done scourin' the pans, come here, and
I'll tell ye what to do next. I rather guess I'll larn
that critter to know her place, afore I've ben here
much longer. She hain't never had no instruction
about what belongs to her sittiwation, at all."</p>

<p>"Poor thing I don't blame her, I'm sure. You
know, Miss Sniffles, the elder's first wife, brought her
up as if she was her own daughter."</p>

<p>"Well, I mean to show her the difference betwixt

<!-- page 206 -->

genteel folks and them that's born to be underlin's.
But ain't that a wonderful strikin' picter?"</p>

<p>"It is, actilly; looks as nat'ral as life&mdash;especially
the elder's specs and your cap."</p>

<p>"I had a couple more just like it took at the same
time: one for Melissy, and t'other for Sam Pendergrasses
wife. I think the position's very interestin'&mdash;me
a leanin' on the elder's shoulder, and holdin'
hold o' his hand."</p>

"They must cost a good deal&mdash;don't see how you
could afford it."

<p>"Well, I'll tell ye how 'twas&mdash;'twas a curus circumstance.
At Miss Penderasses party&mdash;see, I
hain't told ye about her makin' a party for us, I guess;
well, she did, and it was a reglar kind o' a would-if-ye-could
consarn, jist such as she always makes out
when she tries to cut a spludge. But Sam's wife
<i>meant</i> well enough. And on the hull 'twas quite
pleasant. Most o' my old acquaintances was there:
Major Coon and his wife, pompious as ever; Mr.
Crane and his wife&mdash;she 'twas Kesier Winkle. She
don't paint her face no more now her market's made&mdash;looks
wonderful humbly. And there was old Dawson
and his wife&mdash;Widder Jinkins, ye know&mdash;she
'twas Poll Bingham. She and Miss Coon had their
heads together half the evenin', a whisperin' about
me and the elder. But I didn't care&mdash;I tell ye, I hild
my head as high as any on 'em, if not a <i>leetle</i> grain

<!-- page 207 -->

higher. Ther was a great deal o' notice took o' me
and the elder. He talked up and made considerable
o' a sensation. I told him aforehand to do his purtiest,
for I wanted old Dawson's wife to see't I'd got
a pardner ruther above a common plow-jogger, such
as hern is. And I guess she felt it some, for she
looked mighty spiteful. While the elder was a talkin',
she kept a hunchin Miss Coon, and grinnin'. Sam
Pendergrasses wife said she obsarved to <i>her</i> that she
should think I'd be in a constant state o' consarn
about the elder, for fear he'd git choaked with a big
word stickin' in his throat. Miss Pendergrass said
she wouldn't care a cent about it, if she was me; for
'twas plain enough 'twa'n't nothin' but envy because
her husband couldn't talk so."</p>

<p>"But you was gwine to tell about them daggertypes."</p>

<p>"O yes. Well, Sam Pendergrasses wife axed Miss
Coon to play on the pianner. They've got a pianner
for Ann Elizy&mdash;piece o' extravagance in my opinion&mdash;don't
see how Sam Pendergrass can afford such
things&mdash;besides, I don't b'leve Ann Elizy'll ever
make much of a musicianer, for she can't play but a
few tunes yit, and she's ben a takin' lessons amost
three months. I spent the day there one day, and
she thumpt away on the consarnid thing half the time.
'Twas enough to split a body's skull open. Well,
Miss Coon she sot down to the planner&mdash;and o' all

<!-- page 208 -->

things! I wish you could a ben there! If 'twa'n't
<i>killin</i>', then no matter. She throw'd back her head,
and she rolled up her eyes, and she thrum'd it off
with the tips o' her fingers. But good gracious! her
singin'! you'd a gin up I know, if you'd a heerd it!
The way she squawked it out was a caution to old
gates on a windy day! See, what was it she sung?
O, I remember&mdash;a dretful nonsensical thing, that kept
a sayin' every little while '<i>Jimmeni</i> fondly thine
own.' I was perfectly dizgusted."</p>

<p>"But what has all that to dew with the daggertypes?"</p>

<p>"Well, I was a gwine to tell&mdash;why can't ye have
patience? I was settin' right by the pianner when
she sung, and I obsarved that she had on a wonderful
curus buzzom-pin. So, after she'd got done her
music, and gone back t'other side o' the room, I says
to Melissy, says I, what a sing'lar lookin' buzzum-pin
Miss Coon's got on&mdash;wonder what it's made of!
'Why, mar,' says she, 'it's a daggertype o' the Major&mdash;didn't
you never see a daggertype?' 'No,' says I;
'but I've heerd o' 'em.' So Melissy she got right up,
and went and axed Miss Coon if she wouldn't be
kind enough to let mar see her pin. I was awful mad
at Melissy&mdash;didn't want that stuck up critter to know't
I noticed her pin&mdash;so I speaks up, and I says, 'I want
ye to understand, Miss Coon, that I didn't request
Miss Smith to ax ye to show me yer pin,' 'O, law,'

<!-- page 209 -->

says she, 'you're perfectly welcome to see it.' So she
onfastened it, and handed it to Melissy, mighty gracious.
She's always wonderful polite to Melissy&mdash;don't
know, I'm sure, what's the reason she treats her so
much better'n ever she did me; but I s'pose ther
ain't nothin' about <i>her</i> to be jealous of. Well, Melissy
she fetched it over and I couldn't help lookin' at it;
and sure enough, there was the major, nat'ral as life,
with all his tranin' regimentals on&mdash;'twas complete.
Miss Coon axed me how I liked it. 'Tain't wonderful
hansome,' says, I, 'but it looks full as well as the
major.' Miss Coon turned rather red, and 'twas plain
to be seen she felt cut up. Melissy&mdash;silly thing&mdash;she
kind o' wanted to plaster over what I'd said, so she
praised it up to the skies&mdash;said she never see any
thing so perfect&mdash;and axed Miss Coon where 'twas
took. Miss Coon said the major had it took in
Gambletown a few days afore. Ther was a gentleman
stayin' there a few weeks, that done 'em uncommon
correct. 'O, mar,' says Melissy, 'I heerd the elder
say he meant to go home by the way o' Gambletown&mdash;why
can't you stop and have yourn and the elder's
took for me? Jubiter's got a cousin livin' there&mdash;a
young man named Jo Baker, and he's a comin' out
here in a few weeks. You can leave 'em with him to
fetch.' 'Well,' says I, 'I'll see about it.' After that,
Melissy she teazed us till we promise to git 'em for
her. She concluded she'd like to have us represented

<!-- page 210 -->

together in one picter. We'd made our calculations
to stop in Gambletown a day or tew on our way hum.
The elder was some acquainted with Elder Cumstork,
the minister there&mdash;had met him at the meetin' o' the
Baptist Presbytery. We left Wiggletown a Monday,
went round by Pidgin Pint, and stopped there toward
night. The elder inquired where the Baptist
minister lived, and we went there. We hadn't never
heerd o' him afore&mdash;but 'twas better to go there than
to have a tavern bill to pay. His name was Elder
Hawley. The elder he introduced himself as the
Rev. Elder Sniffles, from Scrabble Hill, and his consort.
Well, brother Hawley invited us in and introduced
us to his wife. She was a sick lookin' woman,
with a hull raft o' young ones squallin' round her.
'Twa'n't very pleasant there, they didn't seem to be in
wonderful good circumstances. But they treated us
very polite, and we staid till Thursday, for Brother
Hawley was a holdin' a protracted meetin', and invited
the elder to stay awhile and assist. A Thursday we
come on to Gambletown, got there in the afternoon.
Elder Cumstork was very glad to see us, and so was
his wife. I was quite surprised when I seen her, for
I used to know her some. Her name was Mary
Cushman. She used to keep school in Wiggletown
when Melissy was a little gal. I sent her to Miss
Cushman's school. Melissy liked her very well, but
I never thought much o' her. She was kind o' proud&mdash;couldn't

<!-- page 211 -->

git acquainted with her. She wouldn't
talk about nobody. She had quite a quarrel with
the Widder Jinkins about Alviry. Miss Jinkins took
Alviry out o' school. There was a great deal said
about it. Every body was a takin' sides. Miss Jinkins
went all around blazin' away against Miss Cushman.
But I couldn't hear o' Miss Cushman's saying any
thing, though I s'pose Miss Jinkins did abuse her
shamefully. Well, I invited her to drink tea at our
house a purpose to see if she wouldn't have something
to say about it, but she never' opened her head.
I tried my best to draw her out&mdash;expressed <i>my</i> opinion
o' the Widder Jinkins without resarve. But still
the provokin' critter never said a syllable about the
matter. I tell you 'twas the last time I axed her there
to tea. I was disgusted with her. I took quite a dislike
tew her, and when she went away I didn't care
whether I ever heerd from her agin or not. And I
hadn't heerd since&mdash;didn't know what had become o'
her. But I know'd her the minute I clapped my
eyes on her in Gambletown, for she's ruther a singular
lookin' woman. 'Law me,' says I, 'Mary Cushman,
I want to know if that's you?' 'Jest so,' says
she, 'but I can't for the life o' me tell who you are.'
'The dear me,' say I, 'why I'm the Reverend Miss
Sniffles, she 'twas Widder Bedott, o' Wiggletown.'
'Sure enough,' says she, 'I wonder I didn't know you,
but I've seen so many folks since I was there, it

<!-- page 212 -->

ruther confuses me sometimes.' I thought 'twas a
pretty poor excuse for fogettin' <i>me</i>, but I passed it off.
She was wonderful polite to us. They'd ben to
dinner, but she went and got dinner for us right off.
She don't keep no help, does all her own work, and I
must say she keeps the house in very nice order, and
cooks pretty well considerin' she used to be a school-marm;
school teachers don't ginerally make no great
o' housekeeper's. Her husband seemed to be wonderful
proud o' her; told how well she got along, and
what a good manager she was, and all that. But I
thought I'd let 'em know't I hadn't no great opinion
o' her housekeepin'. She sot on a leg o' biled mutton
for us, and some vegetables and bread and butter.
So when we sot down to the table I declined takin'
any o' the meat. Miss Cumstork axed me if I wa'n't
hungry. 'Yes,' says I, 'but I don't like biled vittals,
ain't used to 'em.' She felt awful bad, and went and
fetcht on some cold roast beef. But I told her she
needn't a troubled herself, for I couldn't eat cold
meat. So she said she'd cut off some slices and beat
'em in a stew-pan. I begged o' her not to dew it, for in
my opinion warmed up vittals wa'n't fit to eat. 'I'll
make out with a potater,' says I, 'and a piece o' bread.'
At last she gin up tryin' to make me take any thin'
else. But the elder he eat wonderful hearty. I kept
a winkin' at him to hold up, but he wouldn't take
the hint. Afterward she brought on a rice puddin',

<!-- page 213 -->

and the elder let into't in arnest. I eat some tew, for,
to tell the truth, I was awful hungry, but didn't
want 'em to think I eat it because 'twas good, so, I
says, says I, 'rice puddin's terrible plain; but it's
better 'n nothin', and I s'pose I shall be sick if I don't
eat somethin'.' When we was alone the elder undertook
to take me to do about findin' fault with the
vittals, but I told him he needn't be consarned, for I
meant to let the Cumstorks see't I know'd what was
what, though I hadn't been a school-marm. And I
made it a pint to turn up my nose at every thing in
the house all the time I was there; and I tell ye, I
couldn't help laughin' in my sleeve to see how oncomfortable
it made 'em feel. Well, we stayed till
the next Monday, and the elder he preached for
brother Cumstork. The Gambletown folks was very
much taken with him, and with me tew, all the most
extinguished indiwiddiwals in the place called on me.
I see that they seemed to think Miss Cumstork was an
amazin' smart, intellectible woman, but whenever I got
a chance I let 'em know't <i>I</i> didn't think so, nor the Wiggletown
folks didn't think so nother. I ruther guess the
Cumstorks'll have to draw in their horns after this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, now, Sister Bedott&mdash;Sister Sniffles I mean&mdash;I
want to know if you think 'twas Christianlike to
go there and abuse that poor woman in her own
house, and talk aginst her to her own congregation
into the bargain, when, accordin' to yer own story,

<!-- page 214 -->

she done all she could to make yer visit pleasant?
I'd be ashamed to tell on't if I'd acted so ridicilous,
I don't see what yer object was cuttin' up so."</p>

<p>"I tell ye I wanted to show 'em 't I know'd what
was what."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess ye show'd 'em <i>one</i> thing pretty plain&mdash;that
ye dident know what <i>politeness</i> was."</p>

<p>"I guess, Sister Magwire, 't I know what politeness
is as well as you dew. It looks <i>well</i> for <i>you</i> to be a'
tellin' <i>me</i> what's right and what's wrong, when my
first pardner was a deacon and my present one's a
minister&mdash;when I want <i>your</i> advice I'll ax for it."</p>

<p>"Well, well, I want to hear about them daggertypes&mdash;how
they make 'em, and all in relation tew it. It's
a wonderful art&mdash;beats all I ever heerd of. How is it
they take 'em in so little while?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell ye. Ther's a pole stuck up in the
middle o' the floor, with a machine atop on't&mdash;kind of
an uplong shaped consarn&mdash;looks for all the world
like the old cannon they haul out on Independence
and training days, about <i>so</i> wide and <i>so</i> long. In the
little eend on't ther's a hole, and into that hole the
daggerotyper slips the steel plate that the picter's to
be made on, and kivers it up. Then ye have to set
down in a cheer about as fur from the machine as
from here to that stove, on an average. Then he fastens
yer head in an iron consarn to keep it still&mdash;for
ye've got to set as onmovable as a wax-work, and as

<!-- page 215 -->

stiff as stillyards, or the picter'll be spiled. Then ye
must look strait at the machine that stans there a pintin'
right at yer face&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Grammany! I should think 'twould be an awful
sittiwation. I should be frightend out o' my wits."</p>

<p>"Lawful sakes! I wa'n't a bit skairt. Well, ther's
a winder right aside o' ye, and a white sheet fastened up
all round ye, and when ye've got fixt, he takes the kiver
off o' the machine, and the light reflects into the winder
and onto yer face, and from yer face it refragerates
onto the steel plate, and executes the picter in a minit."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't understand now a bit better 'n I did
afore."</p>

<p>"I never! how dumb you be? it's as clear as daylight
to me. I seen right through it at first."</p>

<p>"Well, what do they call them daggertypes for?"</p>

<p>"O, I s'pose that's on account o' the dagger they
use to polish off the plates aforehand. Seems to me
that was what Jabe said."</p>

<p>"Jabe who?"</p>

<p>"Why Jabe Clark&mdash;he took that picter."</p>

<p>"You don't!"</p>

<p>"It's a curus circumstance. I'll tell ye how it
happened. I'd no more idee o' the daggertyper bein'
Jabe Clark than nothing in the world. Nobody dident
know it. He was there in Gambletown cuttin' a
mighty swell with his daggertypes&mdash;makin' money
like dirt. Had his gallery over Smith's store&mdash;altered

<!-- page 216 -->

his name&mdash;had a great flarin' sign stuck up over his
door that had on't, 'Mr. Augustus Montgomery,
Daggertyper.' Well, we went in there a Friday to
look at his picturs, and see what he taxed for takin'
'em&mdash;thought mabby he'd strike off some on account
of our belongin' to the clargy. Brother Cumstork
went with us and introduced us; and Mr. Montgomery
was wonderful polite&mdash;showed all his picters; told
us all about 'em tew&mdash;the way he took 'em and so on;
though most on 'em was his own likenesses. There
was Mr. Montgomery a readin'&mdash;Mr. Montgomery a
smokin'&mdash;Mr. Montgomery a shavin'&mdash;and ever so
many more. I forgit what they was all a dewin'.
All the time I kept a thinkin' I'd seen the man afore;
but to save my life I couldent remember when nor
where. He looked kind o' natral some how, and his
voice sounded jest as if I'd heerd it afore. But then
he lookt so different, no wonder I dident know him at
first. He'd cut off his whiskers all, only a bunch on
the tip of his chin; and he'd got on spectacles though
I noticed he looked over the tops of 'em. He had a
wig, tew, considerable blacker 'n his own hair. The
elder and me we stood up together and axed him if
he thought we'd <i>take</i> well. He looked at us a minute,
and then says he, 'Jingo! you'd make an admyrable
picter.' Then it popped right into my head
who 'twas. I was on the pint o' screamin' right out&mdash;but
I happened to think and hild my tongue, for

<!-- page 217 -->

thinks me, I'll come up with ye old feller for that
'grody flewry' afore I quit ye. So I told him we'd
set for our picters; and he fixed the plate and the machine,
and arranged us in our cheers the way we
wanted to be represented&mdash;and then he took us. But
the first one wa'n't good. The Elder he hysted his
eyebrows&mdash;it's a trick o' hisen&mdash;and so his pictur had
as much as a dosen pair of eyes. 'Twas ruther bigger'n
I wanted it tew. I axed him if he couldent
make one ruther smaller. He said, 'O yes, he had a
process by which he could manage 'em down to any
size.' So we sot agin, a little furder off from the machine,
and that time 'twas good. I was so much
pleased with it, I told him I'd have another one took
for Miss Sam Pendergrass, a friend o' mine. The elder
looked ruther surprized, but he dident say nothing.
Well, he got another one full as good as the
first; and I liked it so well, I concluded to have another
one to fetch home with me. The elder opened
his eyes and looked surpriseder 'n ever; but I gin him
a look, and he hild his tongue. After he'd finished
'em all up, and got 'em all sot in the cases, says I,
'Well, now, Mr. Montgomery, what d' ye tax?'
'Well,' says he, 'my reglar price for a double picter
is tew dollars; but I always want to dew the feir
thing by the clargy&mdash;ginerally make a pint to throw
off some for them. So in your case I won't tax but
five dollars for the hull.' As good luck would have

<!-- page 218 -->

it, I happened to have that ar buzzom-pin he sold me
elder in my work-pocket. It had ben there ever
since the Elder first showed it to me. So I takes it
out and holds it up afore him. 'Twas as green as
grass, and any body could see in a minit that 'twas
brass. 'There,' says I, 'that's a buzzum-pin that my
husband bought of a pedlar and paid him five dollars
for it. He was a wonderful pious pedlar&mdash;had jest experienced
religion&mdash;and of course he wouldent take
the advantage of a minister o' the Gospel; and <i>he</i>
said 'twas woth double the money he taxed; but
seein' he was tradin' with the clargy, he wouldent
charge but half-price. To be sure, it dident look so
<i>green</i> then as it does now&mdash;the <i>greenness</i> was principally
on husband's side. Now I'm willin' to dew as
well by you as Jabe Clark done by my husband. I'll
let ye have this pin to pay for the picters, and won't
ax no boot.' Then I gin him a knowin' look.</p>

<p>I wish you could a seen the critter. I tell ye 'twas
<i>rich</i>, as Jeff says. He turned pale, and then he
turned red, and looked as if he was completely
stumped. The elder he begun to ham and haw as if
he was a gwine to say something. But I looked at
him in away that made him think 'twa'n't woth
while. Elder Cumstork tew looked perfectly astonished.
He examined the pin, and says he, "Why
Sister Sniffles, this ere's brass and no mistake&mdash;that
pedlar cheated brother Sniffles most wickedly."</p>

<!-- page 219 -->

<p>"What!" says I, "you don't s'pose that a pedlar
that had experienced religion at a protracted meetin',
and sold splendid 'grody flewry' silk for only a dollar
a yard, and linen cambric handkerchers that <i>wa'n't
half cotton</i>, for half price, would put off a brass buzzom-pin
onto a dargyman for gold! what an idee!"
Brother Cumstork dident say no more. Well, <i>Mr.
Montgomery</i> he stood there with his knees a shakin'
and a lookin' as if he'd like to exasperate through the
key hole. At last says I, "Come, what do you think
o' the offer?" "Well, well," says he, "raly, I&mdash;I&mdash;"
Then I marched strait up to him, and hild the pin
right under his nose, and says I, "Mistopher! do you
darst to say that are pin's brass?" He ketcht it out
o' my hand and stuffed it into his pocket, and says he,
"Well, bein' as you belong to the clargy, I s'pose I'd
ought to accommodate ye." So I took my daggertypes
and started off. Jest as I was a passin' out behind
the men, Jabe ketcht me slyly by the sleeve,
and says he, "Widder!" "That ain't my name," says
I. "Miss Sniffles, I mean," says he, "I hope ye'll
keep <i>dark</i>." I dident say nothing; but after we'd
got into the street, right by the corner of the store,
where ther was a hull mess o' men standin', I looks
up to his winder and shakes my daggertypes in his
face, and says I, "Jaby Clark, don't you feel <i>green</i>?"
Then I explained it to Elder Cumstork; and he told

<!-- page 220 -->

Smith&mdash;and I tell ye it flew like every thing. The
next mornin' <i>Mr. Montgomery</i> was <i>missin</i>'.</p>

<p>There comes the elder&mdash;he's ben over to Deacon
Hugle's. I'll be hanged if he ain't a comin' in without
cleanin' his feet. I wonder if any woman ever
had ther patience so tried as mine is all the time!
Here ye be&mdash;mud and all, I wonder if it ever occurred
tew ye what that scraper was put to the door for?
Ye never think o' cleanin' yer feet no more'n as if
ther wa'n't such a thing in the world. I guess yer
first wife must a ben a wonderful particklar woman."</p>

<p>"I assure you, Mrs. Sniffles, I was not aware that
any particles of mud adhered to the extremities of
my boots."</p>

<p>"I presume ye wa'n't aware on't. Ye'd go head
foremost into a mud puddle as big as a meetin'-house,
and not be aware on't. Sal! fetch here the dust pan,
and brush, and clean up this mud, quick. There!
jest like ye! can't take it up without gittin' down on
yer knees to dew it."</p>

<p>"I got down to look after it&mdash;couldent see where
'twas."</p>

<p>"Couldent see it, hey! Hain't ye no eyes in yer
head? Ye've ben so used to mud and dirt all yer
days, I s'pose you actilly don't see it without it's a
lump as big as yer head. Scoured them pans yit?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<!-- page 221 -->

<p>"Well, why dident ye come and let me know when
ye got done&mdash;say?"</p>

<p>"Because I only just got done this minute."</p>

<p>"That's a likely story! I'll bet a dollar ye've ben
a lookin' out o' the winder, or talkin' to Bets Wilson
this half hour. Go along and make up a fire, and
put on the tea kittle," [boxing her ears] "and then go
out and mop off the steps, and git 'em ready for Mr.
Sniffles to dob up with mud agin next time he comes
in."</p>

<p>"Well, Sister Sniffles, I guess I must go."</p>

<p>"What! I thought ye was a gwine to stay to tea."</p>

<p>"No, I can't&mdash;husband'll be expectin' me hum to
drink tea with him."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'll jest throw on my things and run
over and take a dish with ye, for I'm tired, and don't
feel like gittin' vittals myself."</p>

<p>"Brother Sniffles you come along tew."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Sal you may take off the tea-kettle;
and don't ye make no more fire&mdash;shet up the stove,
and let it go down, and take yer knittin'-work and stick
to't stiddy. If ye want any thing to eat afore we git
back, ye may git some o' that cold pork and taters.
Thank fortin the cubbard's locked, or I s'pose she'd
be a pokin' her nose into the rest o' the vittals&mdash;moopin'
critter."</p>

<h3>XXI.</h3>

<h3>The Rev. Mrs. Sniffles Expesses her Sentiments
in Regard to the Parsonage.</h3>

</div>

<p>"I SAY I'm disgusted with this old house; 'tain't
fit for ginteel folks to live in; looks as if 'twas
built in Noah's time, with its consarned old gamble
ruff and leetle bits o' winders a pokin' out like bird
cages all round. Painted yaller, too, and such a humbly
yaller; for all the world jest the color o' calomel
and jollup!"</p>

<p>"But you are aware, Mrs. Sniffles&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I say 'tain't fit to live in. I'm ashamed on't. I
feel awful mortified about it whenever I look at Miss
Myerses and Miss Loderses, and the rest o' the hansome
sittiwations in the neighborhood, with their wings and
their piazzers and foldin' doors, and all so dazzlin'
white. It's ridicilous that we should have to live in
such a distressid lookin' old consarn, when we're
every bit and grain as good as they be, if not ruther
better."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, the house is very comfortable."</p>

<p>"Comfortable! who cares for comfort when gintility's

<!-- page 223 -->

consarned! <i>I</i> don't. I say if you're detarmined
to stay in it, you'd ought to make some alterations
in't. You'd ought to higher the ruff up and put on
some wings, and build a piazzer in front with four
great pillars to't, and knock out that are petition betwixt
the square room and kitchen, and put foldin'
doors instid on't, and then build on a kitchen behind,
and have it all painted white, with green winder
blinds. <i>That</i> would look something <i>like</i>, and then I
shouldent feel ashamed to have ginteel company come
to see me, as I dew now. T'other day, when Curnel
Billins and his wife called, I couldent help noticin'
how contemptible she looked round at the house and
furniture&mdash;I actilly was so mortified I felt as if I
should sink right through the floor."</p>

<p>"But you know, Mrs. Sniffles&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I say we'd ought to have new furnitur&mdash;sofys and
fashionable cheers, and curtains, and mantletry ornaments,
and so forth. That old settee looks like a sight.
And them cheers, tew, they must a come over in the
ark. And then ther ain't a picter in the house, only
jest that everlastin' old likeness o' Bonyparte. I'll
bet forty great apples it's five hundred years old. I
was raly ashamed on't when I see Miss Curnel Billins
look at it so scornful when they called here. I
s'pose she was a counterastin' it with their beautiful
new picters they're jest ben a gittin up from New
York, all in gilt frames. I seen one on 'em t'other

<!-- page 224 -->

day in to Mr. Bungle's shop, when I went in with
Sister Tibbins to look at her portrait that he's a paintin'.
I seen one o' Miss Billinses picters there.  'Twas
a splendid one, as big as the top o' that are table, and
represented an elegant lady a lyin' asleep by a river,
and ther was a little angel a hoverin' in the air over
her head, jest a gwine to shoot at her with a bow and
arrer. I axed Mr. Bungle what 'twas sent to his shop
for, and he said how 't Miss Billins wa'n't quite satisfied
with it on account o' the angel's legs bein' bare,
and she wanted to have him paint some pantaletts on
'em, and he was a gwine to dew it as soon as he got
time.  He thought 'twould be a very interestin' picter
when he got it fixed. I think so tew. I dew admire
picters when they ain't all dirty and faded out like old
Bony there. Them Scripter pieces that Sister Myers
has got hangin' in her front parlor&mdash;them she painted
afore she was married, strikes me as wonderful interestin',
especially the one that represents Pharoh's
daughter a findin' Moses in the bulrushes. Her parasol
and the artificials in her bunnit is jest as natral as
life. And Moses, he looks so cunnin' a lyin' there
asleep, with his little coral necklace and bracelets on.
O it's a sweet picter. And I like that other one, tew,
that represents Pharoh a drivin' full tilt into the
Red Sea after the Isrelites. How natral his coat-tails
flies out. I think some Scripter pieces would be very
approbriate for a minister's house. We might git Mr.

<!-- page 225 -->

Bungle to paint some for the front parlor, and our
portraits to hang in the back parlor, as Miss Myers
has theirn. But law me! what's the use o' my talkin'
o' havin' picters or any thing else that's decent?
You don't take no interest in it. You seem to be perfectly
satisfied with this flambergasted old house and
every thing in it."</p>

<p>"My former consort never desired any thing superior
to it."</p>

<p>"Your former consort! I'm sick and tired o' hearin'
about her. 'Tain't by no means agreeable to have
dead folks throw'd in yer face from mornin' to night.
What if she was satisfied with her sittiwation?
'Tain't no sign <i>I</i> should be. I s'pose she hadent
never ben used to nothin' better, but I <i>have</i>."</p>

<p>"But, Mrs. Sniffles, you must recollect that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I say 'tain't to be put up with. I want to have
some company&mdash;ben wantin' tew ever sence we was
married; but as for invitin' any ginteel people a visitin'
to such a distressid old shell as this is, I won't dew
it&mdash;and <i>so</i>&mdash;Miss Billins and Miss Loder and <i>them</i>
would say I was tryin' to cut a swell, and couldent
make it out. And I don't mean to accept no more
invitations amonkst them that lives in style, for it aggravates
me, it does, to think how different I'm sittiwated.
So you may make yer pastoral visits without
<i>me</i> in future, for I've made up my mind not to go out
none as long as we live in this ridicilous old house."</p>

<!-- page 226 -->

<p>"But recollect, Mrs. Sniffles, this house is a parsonage&mdash;I
occupy it rent free."</p>

<p>"I don't care if 'tis a parsonage. I say the congregation
might afford you a better one, and for my part,
I'm disposed to make a fuss about it."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Sniffles, you must be aware that I am not
possessed of inexhaustible means. I have never attempted
to conceal from you this fact&mdash;therefore, you
must also be aware that there exists an entire impossibility
of my erecting a new residence on the plan
which you propose. Nor is it at all probable that the
congregation would be willing to make such alterations
in this as you suggest. Yet, I assure you, that I
have not the slightest objection to your employing
your <i>own</i> means in the construction of a more elegant
edifice."</p>

<p>"My own means!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Sniffles. Your dissatisfaction with the
parsonage is so great, that I have for some time past
been expecting you would propose building a new residence;
and I repeat that such an appropriation of a
portion of your funds would meet my concurrence."</p>

<p>"My funds!"</p>

<p>"Your funds, Mrs. Sniffles. It is a delicate subject
and one on which I have hitherto hesitated to make
inquiry, although possessing an undoubted right to do
so. I have been expecting ever since our union, that

<!-- page 227 -->

you would inform me how and where your property
is invested."</p>

<p>"My property!"</p>

<p>"Your property, Mrs. Sniffles. In what does it
consist, if I may be permitted to inquire?"</p>

<p>"Land o' liberty! you know as well as I dew."</p>

<p>"What am I to infer from that observation?"</p>

<p>"Jest what you're a mind to. I ain't woth money,
and I never said I was."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Sniffles, you are well aware that on your arrival
in this place, common report pronounced you to
be an individual of abundant means, and I have always
labored under this impression&mdash;an impression
which, allow me to remind you, yourself confirmed
in a conversation which occurred between us in the
parsonage grove."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say't I <i>told</i> you so, and you
darsent say't I did."</p>

<p>"A-hem&mdash;I mean to say that you did not deny it
when I delicately alluded to the subject. On the contrary
you led me to infer that such was the fact, and
under that impression I was induced to accede to your
proposal."</p>

<p>"My proposal? What do you mean to insinniwate?"</p>

<p>"I should have said your&mdash;your&mdash;evident inclination
for a&mdash;a&mdash;matrimonial engagement. I deeply regret,
Mrs. Sniffles, that you should have allowed yourself
to practice upon me what I can not consider in any

<!-- page 228 -->

other light than that of a heinous and unmitigated
deception. I regard it as an act quite incompatible

<p>"You dew, hey? well, you can't say't I ever told
you out and out that I was woth property; and if
you was a mind to s'pose so from what I <i>did</i> say, I'm
sure 'tain't my fault, nor I ain't to blame for other
folkses saying I was a rich widder."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Sniffles, I lament exceedingly that you should
view it in that light. You can but acknowledge that it
was your duty when I requested information on the
subject, to have given me a correct account of your
property."</p>

<p>"I hadent no property to give ye an accont of."</p>

<p>"You should have told me so, Mrs. Sniffles, and
not have suffered me to infer that you was in easy
circumstances."</p>

<p>"I tell ye agin, I couldent help what you <i>inferred</i>,
and s'pozen I could, which was the most to blame, me
for lettin' you think I was rich, or you for marryin'
me <i>because</i> you thought I was rich? For my part, I
think <i>that</i> was ruther incompatible with <i>your</i> professions.
<i>Ministers</i> had ought to have their affections sot
above transiterry riches."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Sniffles, this is a&mdash;a&mdash;delicate subject, we
will waive it, if you please."</p>

<p>"But I think the congregation ought to fix up the
house."</p>

<!-- page 229 -->

<p>"I will lay it before the session at the next meeting."</p>

<p>"Well, dew, for pity's sake. And if they agree to
fix it, I'll go a journey somewhar while it's a bein' altered,
and you can board round, and Sal can stay at
sister Magwire's."</p>

<p>SABBATH DAY EVENING.&mdash;O, what a precious season
this day has been to me! My pardner has
hild forth with uncommon unction. O, may he long
be a burnin' and shinin' light to the world! My feelins
to-day has been of the most desirable natur. O
that I could say so every night! but, alas! ther is
times when I feel as cold as a stun, when the face o'
creation seems to frown, and evidences is wonderful
dull. And then agin, I'm as bright as a dollar, and
have such wonderful clear manifestations, and such
oncommon nearness&mdash;and such a sense of intarnal
satisfaction. O that I could always feel as I'd ought
to feel. Dear suz! I'm often reminded o' what my
deceased companion, the lamented Deacon Bedott,
used to remark, "We're all poor critters."</p>

<p>To-day we're liable to fall,<br/>

To-morrow up we climb,<br/>

For't ain't our nature to enjoy<br/>

Religion all the time.</p>

<p>MONDAY.&mdash;Have ben very much exercised to-day
on account of Sally Blake, our help. Her depraved

<!-- page 230 -->

natur has showed out in a very tryin' manner. But I
feel to rejoice that I've ben enabled to be faithful with
her. How I have wrastled day and night for that distressid
child! O, that I may have grace to bear with
patience and resignation the daily trials I have to undergo
with her! I feel to be thankful that thus far I
have ben supported and hain't sunk under it as many
would a done. O that I may be enabled to feel and
realize that such afflictions is sent for the trial of my
faith.</p>

<p>THURSDAY.&mdash;O, what a responsible sittiwation is
mine as President of the "F. U. D. G. E., and A. Society!"
I've realized it in an overwhelmin' degree
to-day. Attended the meetin' this afternoon, and
some very onpleasnt circumstances occured. But I
feel to be truly thankful that I had grace to presarve
my uniformity in the midst of the diffikilties. I wish
I could say as much for some o' the rest o' the members,
especially Sal Hugle. O, the vanity and pride
o' that critter! it grieves me to the heart.</p>

<p>SATURDAY.&mdash;My beloved Shadrach has jist informed
me that the parsonage is to be repaired and made
comfortable. My dear pardner has requested it to be
done intirely to please me, and quite unbeknown to
me. It's true it needs it bad enough, but then I never
should a thought o' complainin' about it. I feel that
I'm a pilgrim and a sojourneyer here, and hadent
ought to be partickler, and so I told the elder when he

<!-- page 231 -->

proposed havin' the house repaired. But he insisted
on't and I consented more for his sake than my own.
O that I may be truly thankful for the blessins I injoy
especially for such a pardner!</p>

<p>Blest be tho day o' sacred mirth<br/>

That gave my dear companion birth;<br/>

Let men rejoice while Silly sings<br/>

The bliss her precious Shadrack brings.</p>

<p>DON'T care a snap for him, hey? Now Nancy
Harrington, I want to know if you think
you're a gwine to make me believe such a story as
that? I know <i>better</i>. I can see as fur into a millstone
as any body&mdash;and I know and have know'd for
better 'n six months how't you and Jasper Doolittle
tuck a notion to one another. 'Tis extrawnary how
gals will talk! If you don't care a snap for him,
what makes you go with him to lecters, and concerts,
and sleigh-rides, and all kinds o' dewins? Don't tell
<i>me</i> you don't care a snap for him. He's a real nice
young man tew&mdash;stiddy and industrus and dewin'
well&mdash;you never'll have a better chance in yer life&mdash;mabby
he hain't said nothin' partickler to you yet&mdash;but
that's no sign he ain't a gwine tew as soon as he
gits his curridge up. He's ruther bashful, you know&mdash;it
takes them sort o' fellers longer to come to the pint
in such matters; they want considerable spurrin' up,
and I advise you not to let nobody else hear you say
you don't care nothin' about Jasper Doolittle&mdash;trouble

<!-- page 233 -->

comes o' them kind o' speeches. I know by experience&mdash;I
come purty nigh losin' yer Uncle Joshaway
by makin' an imprudent remark o' that nater. I'll
tell you how 'twas, and mabby you'll take warnin'
by it. I remember egzackly when 'twas&mdash;'twas in
the month o' March, about tew year and a half arter
Sister Bedott was married; yer uncle and me'd ben
keepin' company all winter: he come t' our house
every Sabberday evenin' regularly, besides always
seein' me hum from singin'-school and evenin' meetins,
and so forth&mdash;'twas town talk that we was engaged&mdash;Joshaway
Magwire and Melissy Poole&mdash;that
was the story all round. But all this time, mind you&mdash;he
hadent said a word tew me about havin' on him,
though I was suspectin' every day when he would.
You see he was awful bashful. Well, one night
('twas in the month o' March), we was gwine hum
from singin'-school&mdash;nary one on us dident say nothin'
for some ways. At last yer uncle ham'd and haw'd
tew or three times, and then says he to me, says he,
"Melissy!" says I, "Hey?"&mdash;but he dident continner
for some time&mdash;arter a spell he ham'd and haw'd agin&mdash;and
he says to me, says he, "Melissy!" says I,
"Well&mdash;what?" but still he dident continner. At
last I see we was a gittin' purty nigh hum&mdash;so I says
to him, say I, "Joshaway&mdash;what was you a gwine to
remark?" So then he says, says he, "I was a gwine
to say&mdash;" but his curridge failed and he dident finish.

<!-- page 234 -->

Afore long we come to the gate, and there we stopt
(we used to stop awhile at the gate in a gineral way),
and says he, "Melissy!" says I, "Joshaway Maguire,
what <i>dew</i> you want?" "Why," says he, "I was a
gwine to ax you&mdash;." Jest then yer granf'ther Poole
opened th door and came out, and so yer uncle went
off and I went in. Well&mdash;next day Hanner Canoot
come in t'our house&mdash;and she begun to joke me
about yer uncle&mdash;now I never <i>could</i> bear Hanner
Canoot&mdash;she was a reglar mischief-makin' old maid&mdash;always
a meddlin' with every body's bizness in the
place&mdash;and sure as she see a young cupple appearantly
attached to one another, she'd insiniwate sutin' or
other against 'em. She couldent git no sweetheart
herself, and it made her awful cross-grained and mad
at them as could git 'em. I hadent never had no
diffikilty with her&mdash;but I dispised her&mdash;and yer
gram'ther Poole used to say to me frequently, "Melissy,
dew be keerful what you say afore Hanner
Canoot&mdash;she's a dangerous critter"&mdash;and I <i>was</i> kerful
in a gineral way. And then, you see, ther was
another thing about it&mdash;there was her brother, Josiar
Canoot&mdash;he'd ben tryin' to be perlite to me tew or
three year&mdash;and I wouldent keep company with him,
nor have nothin' to say tew him&mdash;and Hanner she
know'd it, and felt awful spiteful to me on account o'
<i>that</i>. Speakin o' Siar Canoot&mdash;the last time I was up
to Wiggletown, yer Aunt Bedott telled me he was

<!-- page 235 -->

quite pertickler to her. He hain't never ben married.
I s'pose nobody wouldent have him&mdash;he was so lazy
and so consarned disagreeable, and so awful humbly.
Why his hair was as read as blazes&mdash;and he hadent
no nose at all&mdash;and what ther was on't turned right
up straight. When yer Aunt Bedott tell'd me about
his steppin' up to her, I say, says I, "I hope you
won't incurridge him. Silly&mdash;for he's a poor shiftless
critter." "Why no he ain't, nother," says she, "he's
ben in the millentary and got to be Cappen Canoot."
"I don't care for that," says I; "'twouldent make no
difference to me if he was <i>gineral</i>&mdash;he's Si Canoot
and always will be." Well, I felt awful worried
about it, and when I come hum, I telled yer uncle
on't, and says he, "O don't you be afeard o' Silly's
marryin' him. I'll be bound <i>he</i> hain't no idee o'
marryin' <i>her</i>. She always thinks the men has serus
intentions if they look at her"&mdash;that's what yer <i>uncle</i>
said&mdash;and I don't say but what <i>'tis</i> so&mdash;Sister Bedott's
a curus critter&mdash;tho' she's a nice woman in the main.
Well, I was a gwine to tell what Hanner said; she
begun to joke me&mdash;and says she (I was a spinnin' on
a gret wheel you know), well she begun at me and
says she, "Melissy, they tell curus stories about you;"
whiz&mdash;whiz&mdash;whiz went the wheel, and I pertended
I dident hear her. Arter a spell she spoke up louder,
and says she, "Melissy&mdash;they tell strange stories
about you and Joshaway;" whiz&mdash;whiz&mdash;whiz went

<!-- page 236 -->

the wheel, I made as if I dident hear a word, she said&mdash;so
bymeby she turns to your gram'ther (she
was a settin' there), and says she&mdash;"How is it, Miss
Poole? when's that are weddin' comin' on?" "What
weddin?" says mother, says she. "Why, Melissy
and Joshaway Magwire, beshure," says Hanner, says
she. "Never&mdash;not as I knows on," says mother,
says she, "I don't know nothin' about no such
bizness." Well&mdash;she see she couldent git no satisfaction
out o' mother, so she hollers to' me agin, and says
she, "seems to me yer ruther hard o' hearin' to-day,
Melissy." Whiz-z-z-z-z went the wheel louder 'n ever,
and I dident take no notice o' what she said. Party
soon she bawled out agin, and says she&mdash;"I guess
what makes you so deef, you must a ketcht cold in
yer head last night&mdash;'twas rather a long journey you
tuck to git hum"&mdash;(you see yer uncle and me went
hum by the turnpike instid o' gwine cross lots&mdash;but
how the critter found it out, dear knows). Well, I
dident pay no 'tention, but I tell you I was a gittin'
awful mad. Arter a spell she gits up and comes and
dumps herself right down aside o' me, and says she,
"Say, Melissy, dew tell when you and Joshaway's a
gwine to step off&mdash;he's a very nice young man, tho'
I guess he won't never set the river afire." When
she said that, I was completely ryled up. I'd ben a
growin' madder and madder all the time&mdash;to think o'
her tellin' right afore mother about our comin' hum

<!-- page 237 -->

by the turnpike&mdash;and then sayin' "he wouldent never
set the river afire"&mdash;'twas tew much, I couldent hold
in no longer; so I turned round and shook my wheel-pin
in her face, and says I, "Hanner Canoot&mdash;yer a
meddlin' old maid. I wish you'd mind yer own
bizness and lem'me alone about Josh Magwire&mdash;<i>I
wouldent wipe my old shoes on him</i>." Now what did
the critter dew when I spoke so? Why she snorted
right out a laffin, and says she, "O, don't git in a passion,
Melissy&mdash;don't; dew keep your temper till yer
married&mdash;dew." Purty soon she went hum. This
was a Friday. Well&mdash;Sabberday come and I dident
see nothin o' Joshaway. I thought 'twas ruther queer,
but I reckon'd on seein' on him to Wensday evenin'
meetin'&mdash;so I waited with patience till Wensday
evenin' come, and I went to meetin'. Well, he was
there, and I s'posed of course he'd wait on me hum
&mdash;but when meetin' was out, lo and behold! he went
straight apas me and axed Cloey Foggerson if he
should have the pleasure o' seein' <i>her</i> hum! Then it
all come thro' my head like a flash o' lightnin', what
I said to Hanner Canoot&mdash;and I know'd she'd told
him on't as well as if I'd heerd her. I tell you I felt
like death! I never know'd till that minnit how
much I sot by Joshaway Magwire&mdash;the idee o' loosin'
on him was awful aggravatin'.</p>

<p>Well, I got hum somehow or other and went
straight off to bed&mdash;but I dident sleep nun that night.

<!-- page 238 -->

In the mornin' I got up with a tremenjuous headache,
and lookin' as pale as a ghost. Mother, she axed me
whether or no I wa'n't sick. I telled her no; but all
that day I wa'n't fit for no bizness&mdash;dident have no
appertite&mdash;and when night come yer gram'ther felt
so consarned about me, she gin me a dose o' perrigarlick&mdash;cause
she said if I dident sleep that night I'd sartinly
be attacked with the fever. In spite o' the perrigarlick
I dident sleep a wink <i>that</i> night nother.
Next day I felt woss than ever, but I was awful high
sperrited, and I was detarmined nobody shouldent
know the reason. Thinks me if Joshaway's a mind
to use me so, he may and be hanged to him. I ain't
a gwine to kill myself on account o' him&mdash;he ain't the
only young man in the univarse. That was the way
I <i>talked</i>&mdash;to myself&mdash;but talkin' and dewin's tew
things, you know, Nancy. The more I tried to despise
yer uncle, the more I couldent&mdash;the more I tried
to hate him the better I liked him. Well, so it went
on for a number o' weeks. Yer uncle never come
nigh me. I used to see him to singin' school and
meetin', but he never offered to see me hum&mdash;Always
went with Cloey Foggerson. Afore long, every body
was a talkin' about him and Cloey Foggerson. But
what worked me most was&mdash;the gals begun to blagguard
me about losin' my sweetheart, and thinks me,
I'll git him back if I die for't. So arter ponderin'
on't a spell, I made up mind I'd incurridge Siar

<!-- page 239 -->

Canoot, and see 'f <i>that</i> wouldent bring yer uncle tew.
Si was ready enough to step up, you know, but I'd
gi'n him the mitten so many times, he was afeard to
ventur. So one day I goes by his shop (he was a
waggin-maker by trade, you know)&mdash;he was a standin'
in the door as he always was&mdash;in a gineral way&mdash;(he
was everlastin' lazy)&mdash;well, I says, says I, "How
de dew, Mr. Canoot?" I tell you I never see a surprisder
critter 'n what he was&mdash;I hadent spoke tew
him in better 'n a year. "Well as common," says he.
Says I, "Why don't you never come to see us now
days, Mr. Canoot?" The critter was mighty tickled&mdash;and
says he&mdash;"The reason I hain't ben's cause I
reckoned my company wa'n't agreeable." "O! Mr.
Canoot, you mustent think so," says I&mdash;and then I
went off. Well, next night he come t' our house, and
arter that he come every night&mdash;and I tell you 'twas
an awful cross to me to treat him any way decent&mdash;for
I hated the critter like pizen: but I managed to be
perlite tew him, and afore a week's time he poppt the
question. I tell'd him 'twas very onexpected and I
must consider on't a spell afore I gin him an anser.
He seemed appearantly satisfied, and continnerd to
wait on me; and I could see 't yer uncle felt oneasy
by the way he lookt sideways at us whenever he see
us together&mdash;but still he never come nigh me nor offered
tew speak tew me&mdash;and so it went on for tew
hull months. All the nabors begun to talk about

<!-- page 240 -->

Josiar Canoot and me&mdash;and Siar himself was a teazin'
on me to know whether I hadent considered eny most
long enough&mdash;and what to dew I dident know. I
was nigh upon crazy&mdash;my health failed&mdash;I hadent no
appetite, nor no sperrits. Yer gram'ther was awful
oneasy about me. You see I was all the darter she
had left to hum. Yer mar was married and gone, and
yer Aunt Bedott was married and gone tew. Well,
I got to be a miserable critter. One evening, arter
supper, I was in a dretful state o' mind. I know'd
Siar was a comin' that night to git his anser, and I
wanted to git red on him. So I huv on my things
and slipt out and went up to Sister Bedott's. She
lived to the upper eend o' the village; Well, I
found yer Aunt Bedott to hum alone. Yer Uncle
Hez wa'n't in&mdash;gone to some meetin' or other&mdash;and
Kiar (he was a baby then), he was asleep in the cradle.
"I'm glad you've cum," says Silly, says she,
"for I'm awful lonesome. Hez has gun off somewher&mdash;dear
knows wher: 'tis amazin' how any man can
be willin' to leave his pardner alone as much as he
does. I'm clear out o' patience with it&mdash;if it hadent
a ben for that flambergasted young one's havin' the
snuffles, I'd a went off somewher myself." (Yer
Aunt Bedott's a nice woman, but she was always an
awful grumbler&mdash;they <i>dew</i> say she jawed the deacon
out o' the world.) Well, so she went on scoldin' and
frettin' and tellin' her troubles and trials, for ever so

<!-- page 241 -->

long; at last I broke in, and says I, "O! Silly, don't
go on so&mdash;<i>you</i> dont know what <i>trouble</i> is." I said it
in a kind o' way that startled her, and says she, "Melissy,
what dew you mean?" I bust right out a cryin'.
Yer aunt huv down her knittin' work and come
up tew me, and says she, "Melissy Poole, what <i>is</i> the
matter?" I kept on a cryin' and dident anser. At
last say she, "Dew tell what ails you, Melissy, dew&mdash;'tain't
nothin' about Joshaway Magwire, I hope. I
wouldent fret my gizzard for him; ther's as good
fishes in the sea as any 'tever was ketcht yit." Well,
arter a spell, thinks me&mdash;I may as well tell her. So
I telled her the hull from beginning to eend&mdash;how
nigh yer uncle come to poppin' the question&mdash;what I
said to Hanner Canoot&mdash;how she provoked me to say
it&mdash;how ondoubtedly she'd told Joshaway on't&mdash;and
all how and about it. Well, at fust yer aunt blowed
me up sky high, for makin' such an unprudent speech
(she was unprudent enough herself, but she hadent
no patience with any body else for bein' so). At last
says she, "What's said can't be onsaid&mdash;the only way
to mend the mischief is for Joshaway and you to git
together and make it up somehow." "But how <i>can</i>
we git together," says I; "I can't go to see him, and
he don't never come to see me no more." Arter
thinkin' a spell, says Silly, says she (Silly was always
a cunnin' critter), "I've got it now; you jest stay
here and see to the baby, and I'll run into the Widder

<!-- page 242 -->

Magwire's&mdash;it's a good while sence I've been there.
It's purty dark now, and by the time I come hum
it'll be awful dark, and Joshaway he'll come with me&mdash;he's
did it several times&mdash;he's wonderful perlite&mdash;and
when we git to the door I'll ax him to come in
and see husband. Hez won't be to hum 'tain't likely&mdash;but
Josh won't know but what he is&mdash;and when he
once gits in, I'll bet forty gret apples you and he'll
make it all straight purty soon." "O, Silly," says I,
"that's a real good idee&mdash;but you mustent let him
know I'm here, cause if you dew he won't come in."
"I won't, sartin sure," says she. So she put on her
things and off she went, and I sot down the back side
o' the room and begun a contrivin' what I should say
to yer uncle. O, Nancy I you've no idee what a state
of preturbation I was in&mdash;one minnit I was afeard I
shouldent say nothin' to no purpose&mdash;and the next
minnit I was eny most sure o' gittin' Joshaway back
agin. Well, Sister Bedott was gone a hull hour.
You see Joshaway wa'n't to hum when she went, and
so she stayed till he come. It did seem to me as if
she was gone a year. At last I heerd 'em a comin'.
They got to the door and says yer uncle, says he,
"Good night." "O, you come in, dew," says yer
Aunt Silly, says she; "Mr. Bedott wants to see you
amazinly." "Well," says he, " I'll step in a minnit."
So in they come. "Why," says Sister Bedott, says
she, "I wonder where husband is! you set down by

<!-- page 243 -->

the fire and I'll go call him&mdash;he can't be fur off, I'm
sure; he wouldent go off and leave the baby alone."
So he sot down with his back to me&mdash;(I was a settin'
where he dident see me), and she went off into t'other
room and shot the door. Gracious sakes alive! I
never in my hull life experienced such feelins as I did
that minnit&mdash;and I never shall agin if I live a thousand
year. It seem'd as if my heart would jump right
out o' my mouth. Arter a minnit or so I <i>ham'd</i>&mdash;yer
uncle he started and lookt round&mdash;and when he see
me he riz up and made for the door. Thinks me,
I've lost him now sartain, sure. Jest as he got his
hand on the latch, says I, "Mr. Magwire!" He stopt
and lookt round at me, and says he, "Did you speak
to me, Miss Poole?" "Yes," says I. "What did you
want?" says he;&mdash;he spoke so cold and onconsarned,
I felt clear discurridged, and I jest bust right out a
cryin'. So then he come up to me, and says he, "Melissy!"
Says I, "Joshaway, what makes you so cold
and distant to me lately?" Says he, "You're engaged,
ain't you; Melissy?" Says, I "No I ain't&mdash;no
such a thing." Arter a minnit he says, says he,
"What made you say you wouldent wipe yer old
shoes on me?" "Cause I <i>wouldent</i>," says I, "and
ther ain't but one feller in the town I <i>would</i> sarve such
a mean trick, and that's Siar Canoot&mdash;he's jest fit to
wipe old shoes on." Now Nancy what do you s'poze
yer uncle done then? Why he huv his arms round

<!-- page 244 -->

my neck, and giv me such a thunderin' smack as I
never got afore nor sence. "O, Melissy," says he,
"we'll be married arter all the fuss&mdash;won't we?"
"I shouldent wonder," says I. And we <i>was</i> married
in less than a month, and I hain't never had no 'casion
to repent&mdash;for he's made me a fust rate husband; but
only think how nigh I come to losin' on him jest for
speakin' as I did to Hanner Canoot. She hain't never
ben nigh me sence I was married&mdash;and as for Siar,
he was as mad as the Dragon.</p>

Nancy? 'Twa'n't long afore you was married, I
know. Well, ther's been some changes here since
then. We've lost our old minister, Parson Scrantum,
and got a new one. He seems to be a very good man,
Parson Tuttle does&mdash;quite young yet&mdash;jest begun to
preach, hain't ben married but a little while. And his
wife appeared like a nice woman, tew. But I feel
sorry for 'em. This is a trying place for a minister,
and a minister's wife, tew. Though I don't know but
what all places are jest so. All goes on slick enough
yet&mdash;but I'm afeard 'twon't last long. They hain't
ben here but three months&mdash;and the folks are makin'
a terrible fuss over 'em. You know it's the way they
always dew when they git a new minister. They're
ready to eat him up for a spell. And his wife&mdash;lawful
sakes! ther's nothing equil tew her. They make
an awful parade about her. Such treatment spiles the
minister's wives. Afore long they begin to think

<!-- page 246 -->

themselves the most important characters in creation&mdash;and
really expect the hull community to be a flyin'
round all the time to attend tew 'em. And 'tain't at
all surprisin' it should be so&mdash;it's accordin' to natur.
But after a spell, the minister gits to be an old story,
and the people begin to find fault with him. Some
think he's gittin' wonderful tejus; some think he ain't
gifted in prayer, and he ain't sperritual minded enough
to suit some others. But the most gineral complaint
is, that he don't visit enough. As if a minister could
write tew sarmons a week&mdash;sometimes three&mdash;and go
a visitin' every day besides. And then his wife&mdash;'tis
astonishin' how public opinion changes consarnin' her
The <i>upper</i> crust begin to think she's a troublesome
helpless critter. Say she depends on the congregation
to take care of her, and all <i>that</i>. They pick flaws in
every thing she says and does. And the under crust
call her proud&mdash;say she visits Miss <i>This</i>, and don't
visit Miss <i>That</i>. If she invites some of her neighbors
to drink tea with her&mdash;some o' the rest'll be mad, because
she left <i>them</i> out, and say, she feels above 'em.
And so it goes on&mdash;gittin' woss and woss&mdash;she can't
please nobody. After a spell, the deacons begin to
hint to the minister that it's <i>gittin' ruther hard</i> to raise
his salary, and wonder whether or no he couldn't <i>live</i>
on <i>less</i>. If he thinks he couldn't, they wonder whether
or no he couldn't <i>dew more good</i> in some other place.
So at last they drive him to ax a dismission, and the

<!-- page 247 -->

poor man takes his family and goes off somewhere
else, to go through with the same trials and troubles
over again. And after they've been settled about a
dozen times, the minister begins to find out that all
ain't gold that glitters; and his wife if she is a woman
o' sense&mdash;discovers that she ain't a supernatral being
and must take care of herself, like other folks.</p>

<p>That's the experience o' ministers in gineral. I
know it by my own observation&mdash;and I'm sure it
had ben the case with the Scrantums. They'd ben
settled in a number o' places afore they come here;
and Miss Scrantum, herself, told me that it took her a
good while to larn that a minister's life must be a life
o' trial and self-denial. But she did larn it at last.
Miss Scrantum was an excellent woman. She wa'n't
no gadder nor no gossipper. She stayed to hum and
took care of her husband and children. If any body
was sick or sufferin', she was there to help 'em; but
she seldom went out any other time. She was good
to the poor, tew&mdash;and divided her mite with 'em.
You'd a thought folks couldent find fault with <i>her</i>.
But they did. Some grumbled because she wa'n't more
sociable&mdash;and some was mad because she wa'n't what
they called an <i>active Christian</i>&mdash;that is&mdash;she wa'n't willin'
to spend the heft o' her time a runnin' round on
missionary bisness and distribitin' tracts, and so forth.
But <i>every body</i> was outrageous at her, cause she tried
to reconcile Liddy Ann Buel and Deacon Fustick's

<!-- page 248 -->

wife&mdash;instid o' takin' sides with ary one on 'em&mdash;when
they had that awful quarrel about the ostridge feathers.
But I thought&mdash;and think yet&mdash;that Miss Scrantum
acted jest as a Christian ought to act in that bizness,
though every body else blamed her; and Liddy
Ann and Miss Fustick got as mad at her as they was
at one another.</p>

<p>Parson Scrantum was a good man, tew&mdash;and a
smart man&mdash;they dident know how to vally him here.
To be sure he went away of his own accord; but
I s'pose if he'd a wanted to stay, they'd a druv him
off afore long&mdash;jest as they always dew&mdash;for husband
said they was beginnin' to growl about payin' the salary.
I tell ye, I felt dretful sorry when they went
away, and so did yer uncle&mdash;we sot a great deal by
'em. And then they had such a nice family o' children.
Susan, the oldest, is as nice a gal as ever I
know'd. I took a wonderful likin' tew her. Her
mother used to let her come in often and set a spell
with me. I was awful lonesome after Jefferson went
off to study to be a doctor. Yer uncle was in the
shop biggest part o' the day, and I used to be here all
stark alone a good deal o' the time; and when Miss
Scrantum found out how lonesome I was she used to
send Susan over sometimes to see me. She'd fetch her
sewin' or her knittin' and stay an hour or tew; and
sometimes she'd fetch a book and read tew me, and it
used to chirk me up wonderfully. And Mr. Scrantum,

<!-- page 249 -->

he used to come in once in a while, and always had
somethin' good to say.</p>

<p>"You said he went away of his own accord, aunt;
how did it happen?"</p>

<p>Well, I'll tell ye; When they gin him a call to settle
here, they agreed to give him four hundred dollars
a year and a donation party every winter. Well, he
thought he could live on that. Four hundred dollars
was purty small, to be sure, but then they was very
equinomical and industrious&mdash;dident keep no hired
help,&mdash;Miss Scrantum and Susan done all the work
themselves. And they thought the donation party
would be quite a help&mdash;they never'd had none&mdash;they
wa'n't customary where they come from. Well, they
managed to git along through the summer and fall.
(They come here in the spring o' the year.) In December
follerin', the congregation gin 'em their first donation
party. I dident go; I never had ben to none;
used to kind o' want to go sometimes&mdash;but yer uncle
wa'n't willin' to have me&mdash;he never approved o' them
givin' visits. He thinks that when the people want to
make their minister a present, they'd ought to give it
in a private way, and not go and turn his house upside
down, to dew it. So I dident go to that one. But I
don't think the Scrantums thought any the less of us
for it; for they know'd we was as willin' to dew well
by 'em as any o' the congregation was, for yer uncle
always paid his pew rent promptly, and that's more'n

<!-- page 250 -->

some that was richer done. And, besides that, we
often sent 'em presents. They always looked upon us
as the best friends they had here.</p>

<p>Well, never heerd how the donation party come
out. Miss Scrantum never said nothing about it, and
I never axed her no questions; only I know that
through the rest o' the winter the minister's folks
seemed to be more pinched than ever. I was in there
quite often, and though they dident make no complaints,
I could see plain enough that they had to
scrimp and save, and patch and turn every way, to
keep any how comfortable; for they had house-rent
to pay, and six children to support, and it takes considerable
to <i>feed</i> so many, to say nothin' o' clothin' and
eddicatin' on 'em. They had a good deal o' company,
tew, and that costs something. You see they had to
entertain all the stragglin' agents that come along, for
all sorts o' societies in creation. They'd stop there to
save payin' tavern bills. It's the way they always
dew, ye know. Well, they contrived to live along
till the next winter. The time come round for another
donation party; and I says to yer uncle, says I&mdash;"Husband,
I want to go to that givin' visit." "O,
shaw," says he, "what do you want to go for?" "O,
says I, " 'cause I think so much o' the minister's folks."
"Well," says he, "that's the principal reason why <i>I</i>
should want to <i>stay away</i> from the givin' visit myself;
as for you&mdash;of course you can do as ye please."

<!-- page 251 -->

"Well, then," says I, "if you hain't no objections, I'll
go; and I wish you'd go tew, jest for once." " 'Tain't
no use to ax <i>me</i> to go," says he; "it's aginst my principles;
I always mean to dew all I'm able to support
the Gospel and help the minister; but as for them
<i>bees</i>&mdash;I won't countenance 'em by my presence&mdash;that's
all; and let me tell ye one thing, if you go, I'll bet a
cookey you'll wish you hadent a went afterward."
"Well that's <i>my</i> look out," says I. "If you're willin'&mdash;I'll
go." "And what'll ye take?" says he, "a
stick o' tape, or a pint of emptins, or what?" "No, I
won't," says I, "I'll take something o' more vally than
<i>that</i>." "Then you'll be <i>odd</i>," says he.</p>

<p>So after considerin' a spell, I concluded to git, what
Miss Scrantum needed about as much as any thing, and
that was a new bunnit. She wore a shabby, faded old
thing, that looked as if it came over in the ark. Well,
I thought I could git a ginteeler one in Harristown,
than I could by havin' on't made here. So I got yer
uncle to harness up the hoss for me, one afternoon,
and bein' as he was tew busy to go with me himself, I
went over and axed Susan Scrantum to go 'long; I
thought she could help me about pickin' on't out.
She'd be likely to know what would suit her mother.
So I goes over and calls for Susan. She was delighted
to go&mdash;she dident git a chance to ride very often.
Well, we druv to Harristown, and went into the best
lookin' milliner's shop ther was there. "Now, Susy,"

<!-- page 252 -->

says I, "I'm a gwine to git a new bunnit, and I want
your advice about what to choose." "Why, Miss
Magwire," says she, "I thought you had quite a nice
one a ready." "Well, it is middlin' nice," says I,
"but I've wore it tew winters, and some ladies gits a
new one every winter, ye know." So we examined
all the bunnits in the shop, and I axed Susan which
she liked the best. "I should think that one would be
very purty for you," says she, pintin' to a plum-colored
satin one that hung on a peg. "It's ma's favorite
color, and that makes me like it." Now that was jest
what I wanted to know. So I axed the milliner to
hand it down, and I tried it on, for I reckoned if 'twould
fit me, 'twould fit Miss Scrantum&mdash;she was
about my size&mdash;and it did fit nicely, so I bought it. I
had to pay six dollars for't&mdash;quite a launch out for me
&mdash;more'n ever I paid for a bunnit for myself. Susan
looked as if she thought I was ruther extravagant, but
she didn't say nothing. Well, I put it in a bandbox
I fetcht, and we went hum. When yer uncle come in
I showed it tew him, and he was quite pleasd with it;
and '<i>twas</i> a clear beauty, plum-colored satin, trimmed
off with a ribbin the same color, and lace borderin',
with white satin bows between, all quilled round the
inside. I axed yer uncle if 'twas more expensive
than he was willin' I should give. "No," says he, "I
don't begrudge the money. I want you to dew the
hansome thing; but 'twould suit me a great deal better

<!-- page 253 -->

if you wait till the next day and then take it over."
"O husband," says I, "I've got my heart sot on attendin'
the party; dew lemme go." "Well, go," says
he, "if you're beset tew; but mark my words, I'll
bet a dollar you'll wish you hadn't a went."</p>

<p>Well, the day afore the party Jefferson come hum
to stay a few days. I told him I was gwine to the
donation party, and he said he'd like no better fun
than to go with me. Jeff's always ready to go, you
know. So he went and got a ream o' nice paper for the
parson to write his sermons on. At last the day came,
and I and Jeff, we started off for the party. "We
went quite early in the evenin', for I wanted to be
there 'fore 'twas crowded. Ther hadent nobody come
when we got there, only three or four ladies, that was
a gittin' the supper ready. There was Glory Ann
Billins, and Polly Mariar Stillman, and Jo Gipson's
wife, and old mother Parker a settin' the table. You
know at them kind o' dewins they always have a supper
sot for the company. The congregation provides
the intertainment ginerally, but in this place the
minister's wife has to find a good share on't. Miss
Scrantum found the tea and coffee, and sugar and
cream, and butter, and so forth. Some o' the neighbors
sent in cake and pies, and cheese and biscuit.
But Miss Scrantum was afeared ther wouldent be
enough o' the cake and pies&mdash;so she sent to the baker's
and got a mess more. Well, I axed Miss Gipson

<!-- page 254 -->

where we should put our donations, and she told us
to take 'em in the parlor and lay 'em on the table.
Ther was a table there a purpose to put the dry goods
on. The provisions was carried into the store-room.
So we went in there and laid 'em on the table. The
bunnit was pinned up in a newspaper. Jeff he sot
down, and I started off to find Miss Scrantum. I found
her in the kitchen a makin' coffee. She looked dretful
tired and beat out. I was real sorry I hadent a
went sooner and helped her. She was wonderful glad
to see me; and I told her to go and dress herself, and
I'd make the coffee. So she thanked me and went&mdash;and
I took hold and made the coffee. Ther was an
awful sight on't; I never made so much afore in all
my born days, and I never expect to agin. 'Twas
made in Miss Scrantum's biler. She'd scoured it up
for the occasion. 'Twas a biler that held ten pails
full&mdash;and it was brimmin full o' coffee. After I'd got
it made, I went back into the sittin'-room. They'd
got the table all sot. Ther was lots o' cake, and biscuit,
and pies, and cold meat, and all sorts o' stuff.
Then I went into the parlor, and lo and behold, Jo
Gipson's wife and Miss Parker had ondid the bunnit,
and was admirin' on't at a wonderful rate. Jest then
Mr. and Miss Scrantum and the children come in, and
dear me! how pleased they were with the bunnit.
Miss Scrantum, she tried it on, and it fitted her to a T.
But Susan! you'd ought to seen Susan! She jumped

<!-- page 255 -->

and frisked around, and dident hardly know what to
dew with herself, she was so delighted. "O, Miss
Magwire," says she, "that beautiful bunnit wasn't for
you after all, was it? What a dear good woman you
are to make ma such a fine present. She'll look as
nice as any body now&mdash;won't you ma?" They seemed
wonderful pleased to see Jefferson, tew; and Mr.
Scrantum was very glad to git the paper&mdash;said 'twas
jist what he wanted. Well, purty soon the company
begun to come, and they come pourin' in, thicker and
faster till the house was crammed. The settin'-room
door was locked, so as to keep 'em out o' there till
supper was ready&mdash;and I tell ye all the rest o' the
house was jest as full as it could stick. The parlor and
the hall and the bed-rooms was all crowded and crammed.
You'd a thought from the number o' folks
that was there, that ther'd been a wonderful sight o'
donations brought&mdash;but as true as I'm a livin' critter&mdash;that
table wa'n't half full. But then ther was a
good many families that fetcht one article to answer
for the hull. For instance, Deacon Skinner and his
wife and four darters and tew sons was all there&mdash;and
Miss Skinner fetcht a skein o' yarn to knit Parson
Scrantum some socks. Miss Hopkins and her three
darters and her son and his wife, that was a visitin' her,
and <i>their</i> three children all come&mdash;and Miss Hopkins
brought half a pound o' tea. And the Runyons with
their four young ones&mdash;what do you think they

<!-- page 256 -->

brought? why, Miss Runyon fetcht a little fancy
basket to stick on the center-table and put visitin'
cards in. And the Miss Footes, three on 'em they
brought Miss Scrantum a pair o' cuffs. And all the
Binghams, they fetcht a neck ribbon for Susan. And
Deacon Peabody and his tribe, ther's as much as a
dozen on 'em, they brought a small cheese. I heerd
afterward that half o' it was a donation and t'other
half was to go for pew rent. And Cappen Smalley and
all his children was there. He fetch a box o' raisins
out o' his store, ther was twelve pound in't and Susan
told me afterward that ten pound was to go toward
pew rent and the rest was a present. The Widder
Grimes and Charity was there, of course. They
dident go nigh the donation table for some time, and
I was kind o' curus to know whether they'd brought
any thing, and so I watch'd 'em, and bimebye, I observed
Charity go up slily, when she thought nobody
didn't see, and lay a little paper on the table. I had
the curiosity to see what was in it, so as soon as I got
a chance I took up the paper and peeped into 't, and
lo and behold! there were two skeins o' thread! did
you ever? Widder Grimes is well off, but she's tew
stingy to be decent, and Charity's jest like her. Then
there was ever so many belonging to other denominations,
that dident bring nothin'; they come to show
their good will, to let folks see that <i>they</i> wa'n't bigoted
and prejudiced, though they did differ in a religious

<!-- page 257 -->

pint o' view, and git their supper. And besides them,
I noticed a great many that I never see before&mdash;nobody
knows where they come from nor where they
went tew. I guess they must a been raised up for the
occasion. And then ther was an awful sight o' children
that straggled in from every where. Doctor
Lippincott, he was there, bowin' and scrapin' round as
usual&mdash;awfully anxious about every body's health;
and his wife, tew, as much consarned as he was&mdash;and
their promisin' red-headed boy, and interestin' darter,
Anny Marier, with her six starched skirts on&mdash;takin'
up more room than ary ten decent drest girls in the
room. The doctor always goes to all the donation
parties for fifteen miles round, to make himself popilar,
but nobody knows of his ever takin' any thin'. On
this occasion, Anny Mariar took a <i>book-mark</i> to Mr.
Scrantum, with a thing on it that looked like a <i>choppin'-knife</i>,
and a mess o' French nonsense below it.
But the greatest part o' the performance was the seminary
gals and their donation. Ther was twenty-five
on 'em, and what do you suppose they fetcht? Why,
the hull kit and cargo on 'em had conspired together
and made a rag-baby for little Adeline Scrantum, and
rigged it up in gauze and tinsel, and they all come
together and brought that. Miss Pinchem, their
teacher, wa'n't there. She was sick o' somethin'. I
guess if she had a come, she'd a kept 'em a little
straighter. Land o' liberty! I never see such an

<!-- page 258 -->

actin' set o' critters in all my born days! They
carried on like all possesst. I see some on 'em a
flourishin' round Jeff&mdash;he's always ready for a scrape,
you know&mdash;and I was afeared he'd git to carryin' on
with 'em and I wouldent a had him for any thing, so
I gin him a caution. "Jeff," says I, "you let them
seminary galls alone; they're a wild set; 'tain't
proper to cut up so in the minister's house." Jeff
promised to keep clear on 'em&mdash;he generally does as
I want him tew. I'll say that much for Jefferson, he's
always been good about mindin'. But it went hard
with him to dew it then; he was ripe for fun, and
determined to let off the steam some way or other.
So he looks round and he sees Charity Grimes stuck
up on the settee 't other side o' the room. Stiff as a
poker and prim as a pea-pod&mdash;you know what a
starched up, affected old critter she is. Jeff went to
school tew her when he was little, and she snapped
his ears and cuffed him round, so he's always hated
her like pizen ever since. She's ben tryin' this twenty
year to git married and can't make it out. She'd
chased after Squire Fuller ever since his wife died.
Squire Fuller got married about a month afore that&mdash;and
yer uncle says he verily believes he did it in self-defense,
jest to get rid o' Charity Grimes&mdash;she bother'd
him to death; he couldent go out in company but
what she'd contrive to hook on to him. He's a very
perlite man, the Squire is, and he dident want tew be

<!-- page 259 -->

rude to her, but he couldent bear her, though she tried
hard to make folks think he was her beaux. At last
he got married, quite suddenly, to a young woman in
Chenang county; and yer uncle says, he don't believe
he'd a done it, if it hadent a ben to get rid o' Charity
Grimes; for his wife had ben dead five year, and he
seemed to be uncommon contented <i>for a widdiwer</i>.
But I was gwine to tell you what Jeff done. He see
Charity a sittin' there a tryin' to dew the agreeable to
Cappen Smalley (<i>his wife</i> hadent been dead long&mdash;by
the way, they'd make a good match, wouldent
they?) Well, Jeff says to me, says he&mdash;"Mother,
may I go <i>stir up</i> Charity Grimes?" "I don't know
what you mean by stirrin' on her up," says I. "O,"
says he, "I jest want to condole with her a little on
the loss o' Squire Fuller." "No," says I, "you
needent dew no such thing; 'twould be very improper,
indeed, and very aggravatin', tew." "Well,"
says he, "mayn't I jest go and talk a little Shakespeare
tew her? (Jeff's always quotin' Shakespeare,
you know.) "I'm afeerd you'll say something sassy,"
says I. "No I won't," says he. "I'll be all-killin'
perlite." "Well go, then," says I. So off he steps,
demure as a deacon. "Good evenin', Miss Grimes,"
says he. "Good evenin', Mr. Magwire," says she,
"It seems like old times to see you agin," says he
and then he obsarved to Cappen Smalley&mdash;"I used to
go to school to Miss Grimes when I was young."

<!-- page 260 -->

Charity puckered up her mouth and grinned, and says
she, "Yes, you was quite a boy then&mdash;and I was a
mere child myself, exceedingly youthful for a teacher."
"Well," says Jeff, says he, "you hain't altered a spek
since&mdash;you hold your own amazingly&mdash;you looked
every bit as old then as you dew now; but how do
you <i>feel</i> about these days?" "Feel!" says she, pickin'
up her ears, "I feel as well as common&mdash;why shouldent
I?" "Excuse me," says Jeff, "I only axed because
I didn't know but you felt ruther nonplussed,
put to't for business as it were, since Squire Fuller
got married. 'Old feller's ocerpation's gone' now, I
s'pose, as Shakespeare says." Gracious! how mad
Charity was! She brustled up like a settin' hen, and,
says she&mdash;"Jeff Magwire, I don't care a straw for
what Shakespeare nor none o' the rest o' your rowdy
acquaintances says about me, I'm above it; but whoever
he is, you may tell him he's an impudent puppy,
for callin' a <i>young lady</i> an <i>old feller</i>&mdash;and you're
another for tellin' on't." So she got up and flounced
out into the hall. The folks all giggled and seemed
wonderful tickled; but Jeff, he looked round as
astonished as he could be, and says he&mdash;"I wonder
what ails Miss Grimes. I thought for the life o' me
she was a gwine to snap my ears, as she used to when
I was young." I was vexed at Jeff, and took him to
task as soon as I got a chance; but he declared

<!-- page 261 -->

'twa'n't "<i>old feller</i>" he said, but somethin' else&mdash;however,
it sounded jest like it, any way.</p>

<p>Just then the door was thrown open, and we was
invited out to supper. So we went squeezin' and
crowdin' into the settin'-room. Some o' the folks
pushed and jammed as if they were afeared they
shouldent git the best chance. Glory Ann Billins sot
at one end o' the table a pourin' coffee, and Jo Gipson's
wife at the 'tother end a pourin' tea; and I tell
ye, 'twas as much as ever they could dew to pour it
fast enough. Jeff, he flew round and helped the
ladies. For my part, I dident feel like eatin' much&mdash;I
was jammed up agin the wall and couldent stir hand
nor foot. So I told Jeff to fetch me a cup o' tea and
nut-cake, and he did; and I took 'em and managed to
eat the nut-cake, but somebody hit my elbow and
made me spill the heft o' the tea; so I stood and held
my empty cup, and looked on to see the performance.
I say for't if 'twa'n't worth seein', I'm mistaken.
Why, if I was a starvin' to death, I shouldent be
willin' to act as some o' them folks did. They pushed,
and elbowed, and pulled, and hauled, and grabbed
like crazy critters. 'Twas amusin' to see 'em put
down the vittals&mdash;I'd a gin a sixpence, Nancy to had
you there; 'twould a ben fun for you to look on and
see the dewins. You'd a thought the biggest part o'
the company hadent had nothin' to eat since the last

<!-- page 262 -->

donation party, and dident expect to have nothin'
more till the next one.</p>

<p>The wimmin, as a general thing, took tea, and eat
the cake and pies, and so forth. And the men, they
let into the coffee, and biscuit, and cheese, and cold
meat, and such like. I actilly see Deacon Skinner
drink six cups o' coffee, and eat in proportion. And
Dr. Lippincott, my grief! 'twas perfectly astonishin'
to me that one mortal body could hold as much as
that man put in&mdash;no wonder he's so fat&mdash;they say he
gits the heft of his livin' away from home&mdash;contrives
to git to one patient's house jest as dinner's ready,
and to another's jest at tea time, and so eats with 'em.
And I wish you'd a seen the Widder Grimes. Grammany!
how the critter did stuff! I took partickler
notice of her, and I see she had an awful great work-bag
on her arm, and every little while she'd contrive
to tuck a piece into't when she thought nobody wa'n't
a lookin'. As soon as I got a chance, I hunched Jeff,
and says I&mdash;"For pitty's sake, Jeff, do obsarve the
Widder Grimes." So Jeff, he watched her a spell.
"By George!" says he, "if that ain't rich!" I tell
ye, 'twas fun for Jeff. Bimeby&mdash;after she'd got her
bag purty well filled, says Jeff to me, says he&mdash;"Now,
mother, may I stir her up a little?" "I don't care,"
says I. So he reached forrard and hollered across the
table tew her, loud enough for every body to hear&mdash;"Miss
Grimes, may I come to your party?" "My

<!-- page 263 -->

party?" says she; "what do you mean?" "Why,"
says Jeff, says he, "I reckoned from the size o' your
bag, and the quantity o' provissions you was 'a layin'
in, that you was a calculatin' to make a party, and I
thought I'd like to come." Every body looked at
Miss Grimes; and, I tell ye, she looked as if she'd
like to crawl into some knot-hole&mdash;and I don't know
but what she did, for she made her disappearance
amazin' soon after. And, then, them seminary gals&mdash;gracious!
how they did eat! I s'pose they was half-starved
at Miss Pinchem's. Afore long the table was
purty well cleared, and Miss Scrantum had to go to
the buttry and bring on all 'twas left, "I guess every
thing in the house that could be eat, without stoppin'
to cook it, was made way with that night. When
the seminary gals had eat all they wanted, they
amused themselves a throwin' hunks o' cheese and
buttered biscuit at the young men. After most o' the
other eatables had been disposed of, Dave Runyon,
great gump! went into the buttry and brought out
the box o' raisins that was to go toward Cappen Smalley's
pew-rent, and handed 'em round. Every body
grabbed, especially the seminary gals, and children,
till ther wa'n't one left in the box. When supper was
about finished, Jane Elizy Fustick (she's always a
tryin' to dew something cunnin'), she went into the
store-room and got a chain o' sassages, that old Miss
Crocker brought, and come along slily and throw'd

<!-- page 264 -->

it round Liph Peabody' s shoulders. Liph, he was a
standin' by the tea board a drinkin' a cup o' coffee.
When he felt the sassages come floppin' round his
neck, he was skairt, and whisked round suddenly and
hit the tea-board, and knocked it off onto the floor,
and smash went every thing on it! What made it
more aggravatin' was, ther was a dozen chany cups
and sarcers on it that Miss Scrantum had fetcht out
after the folks come out to supper. They was some
that she sot a great deal by; her mother giv 'em tew
her, and her mother was dead. She dident bring 'em
on at first, for fear they'd git broke. She sot on all
her common crockery, and borrerd a good deal at
Smalley's store, calculatin' if any on't was broke to
pay for't. But when she see so many folks come
crowdin' out, she was afeard ther wouldent be cups
enough, so she fetcht out her mother's chany cups and
sot 'em on the tea-board. But Glory Ann got along
without usin' 'em, and there they sot, and when the
tea-board fell, they fell tew, and every one on 'em
was broke or cracked. Gracious I how Miss Scrantum
looked when she see her precious chany all to pieces.
She dident say a word, but her lips quivered, and she
trembled all over. But she seemed to overcome it in
a minnit, and went away and brought a basket and
begun to pick up the pieces, and Jeff and I took hold
and helped her. A good many o' the company had
gone back into the parlor; but ther was enough left

<!-- page 265 -->

to track the sassage round, and, my goodness! what
work they made with 'em! While we was a pickin'
up the crockery, all of a sudden ther was a terrible hullerballoo
in the parlor&mdash;Jeff and me rushed in to see
what was the matter, and gracious granfather! what
do you s'pose it was? Why one o' them pesky seminary
gals had throw'd a hunk o' cheese and hit Miss
Scrantum's parlor lamp that was a settin' on the table,
and knocked it over and broke it all to flinders. But
that wa'n't the wost on't&mdash;where it tumbled over it
fell right onto that plum-colored sattin bunnit, and the
ile run all over it in a minnit. Afore anybody could
ketch the bunnit, one side on't, ribbon and all, was
completely ruined. Such a sight as 'twas, you never
sot your tew lookin' eyes on! All the ile that dident
go onto the bunnit was soaked up in the paper that
Jeff took, that was a lyin' right aside on't, and the
biggest part o' that was spiled tew. My grief! how I
<i>did</i> feel when I see that beautiful bunnit in such a
condition! And poor Miss Scrantum turned pale as
death, and Susan cried like every thing. I axed Sam
Lippincott (the doctor's red-headed boy) who 'twas
that throwed the cheese&mdash;he pinted out the gal, and I
goes up to her, and, says I&mdash;"You good-for-nothin'
little huzzy hain't you no better manners than to be a
throwin' cheese at other folkses lamps in that way?"
She was a real sassy little thing, and dident care a
straw for what she'd done. She looked up and

<!-- page 266 -->

grinned as imperdent as could be, and says she&mdash;"Excuse
me, marm&mdash;I tadn't the most remote idee o'
hittin' the lamp. I meant to aim at Sam Lippincott's
head, and mistook the lamp for it. I'm sure you
can't blame me for makin sich a <i>natral</i> mistake." Did
you ever! I was a good mind to hit her a cuff aside
o' the head, but I dident. I told Miss Pinchem on't,
though, the next day&mdash;and she punished the huzzy
by keepin' her on bread and water a week. Jeff said
'twas a very, <i>equinomical</i> kind o' punishment. Well,
the party broke up purty soon after this scrape, and
Jeff and me went hum. Jeff went off to bed. Yer
uncle was out; dear me I how I <i>did</i> dread meetin'
him! Afore long he come in. "Well," says he,
"how did the party go off?" "O, well enough," says
I; "but I'm tired and sleepy, and we won't talk
about it to-night." The fact is, I felt tew mean to tell
him the truth&mdash;but in the momin', when Jeff come
down, he let it all out. My grief! how yer uncle did
crow over me. "Didn't I tell ye so?" says he;
"don't ye wish you hadn't a went?" "Yes," says I,
"if it's any satisfaction tew ye to know it&mdash;I dew
wish so." "I know'd ye would," says he. I verily
believe he was glad the bunnit got spiled.</p>

<p>The next mornin', as soon as I got my chores done
up, I went over to Mr. Scrantum's to see how they
come on, and help 'em regilate a little. Murder-alive!
such a sight as that house was, from one end to t'other,

<!-- page 267 -->

I never sot my tew  lookin' eyes on! The carpets
was all greased up with butter, and cheese, and sassages.
And then the lamp ile had done more mischief
than we know'd on the night afore. It had run off
the table and made a cruel great spot on the best carpet;
and I found Miss Scrantum a tryin' to wash it
out. I sot tew and helped her&mdash;but 'twa'n't no use&mdash;'twouldent
come out. Susan, she was a settin' on a
little stool a scourin' teaspoons, and cryin' as if her
heart would break. "What's the matter, dear?"
says I&mdash;but the poor child couldent answer me. So
her mother said she was a cryin' about the bunnit
bein' spiled. "No wonder," says I, "it's enough to
make any body cry. I s'pose you can't dew nothin'
with the bunnit, can you?" " O, yes," says Miss
Scrantum, says she; "I've ben lookin' at it this mornin',
and I think I can get enough out of it to make a
bag of. It'll make a very nice bag&mdash;and I shall keep
it as long as I live, for your sake, Miss Maguire." I
looked at the woman with surprise. There she sot
on the floor, a rubbin' away at that grease spot, and a
talkin' as calmly about that six dollar bunnit, as if
it hadent a cost more'n six cents. I was kind o'
vexed a her for not makin' more fuss about it. I actilly
begun to think she hadent no feelin', and dident
care for nothing. "And then," says I, "to think o'
their breakin' your beautiful chany&mdash;'twas shameful&mdash;a
present from her mother tew; and you sot <i>so</i>

<!-- page 268 -->

much by it; and I've heerd ye say 'twas the last
thing yer mother ever giv ye." I was a runnin' on in
that way when I thought I heerd Miss Scrantum sob&mdash;I
looked up and she was a cryin' dretfully. She
couldent hold in no longer when I spoke o' the chany.
I was sorry I said a word about it; but it convinced
me that Miss Scrantum had feelins, deep feelins; but
she'd larn't to control 'em, poor woman! Well, I
stayed a spell and helped 'em clean up, and then I
went hum. Susan went to the door with me. When
we got outside, I axed her whether ther was many
provisions brought in the night afore. She told me
to come to the store-room and look. So I went into't
and took a view, and there was tew or three punkins,
a couple o' spare ribs (<i>spare</i> enough, tew, I tell ye),
three or four cabbages, a chicken, what was left o'
Deacon Peabody's cheese, and a codfish. "Is that
all?" says I. "Yes," says Susan, "and half o' the
cheese, and one o' the spare ribs and the chicken are
to go for pew-rent&mdash;I heerd pa tell ma so; but you
mustent let 'em know I told you about it&mdash;for they'd
think it wrong for me to speak of it; you won't tell
'em, will you, Miss Maguire?" "No, darlin'," says I,
"I won't let it out." So I went hum&mdash;and as I went
along considerin' the matter, I come to a unanimous
conclusion in my own mind, that <i>donation parties was
a humbug</i>.</p>

<p>Well, the next Sunday Parson Scrantum requested

<!-- page 269 -->

the male members of his congregation to meet him
the next evenin' at the meetin'-house. Ter uncle
went to the meetin'. I was in a wonderful fidgit to
know what was the object on't&mdash;and quite impatient
for husband to come hum. When he come I obsarved
he was oncommonly tickled about something. "What
is the matter? dew tell, for pity's sake," says I.
"Why, the minister's axed a dismission," says he.
"You don't!" says I. "Jest so," says he; and then
he haw-haw'd out a laffin. " "What ails ye, man alive?"
says I; "I don't see what ther is to laff at in that; for '
my part, I look upon't as a great misfortin to Scrabble
Hill, to lose such a minister as Parson Scrantum. I'm
astonished to see you laff." "Well, you won't be,"
says he, "when I tell ye about the meetin'." So he
went on and gin me the hull description. He said,
that when Mr. Scrantum told 'em he wanted a dismission,
they was wonderful surprised&mdash;Deacon Skinner
he riz and axed the reason. So Mr. Scrantum stated
that he found it onpossible to support his family on
his salary. Deacon Skinner said <i>that</i> was curus&mdash;he
thought four hundred dollars was <i>purty well up</i>. Deacon
Peabody said he thought so tew, especially with a
donation party besides. Deacon Fustick, he put in, and
said 'twas ruther a queer time for a minister to complain
of his congregation, jest after they'd gin him a
<i>bee</i>&mdash;and he axed Dr. Lippincott what was <i>his</i> opinion.
(Now Dr. Lippincott never had, an opinion in all his

<!-- page 270 -->

life, on any subject&mdash;if he had, he never expressed it
for fear of injurin' his practice; 'tain't even known
what his politics is&mdash;he always contrives to be away
on election days.) So he hemmed and hawed, and
said that really he hadn't <i>made up his mind</i>&mdash;he hoped
Mr. Scrantum 'preciated his donation party&mdash;he hoped
the congregation 'preciated Mr. Scrantum; he wished&mdash;he
wished things wasn't sittiwated jest as they was
sittiwated; and that was all they got out of him. Old
Parker observed that minister's families, somehow,
took more to support 'em than any body else. Mr.
Scrantum said that his family was as equinomical as
they could be, but he had a good many children, and
'twas purty difficult to dew as he'd ought tew by 'em
on four hundred dollars a year; axed 'em whether
they thought ary one o' them could dew it. Cappen
Smalley, rich old curmudgin, stuck up his head and
said he guessed <i>he</i> could dew it&mdash;any <i>reasonable</i> man
could dew it&mdash;especially with the help of a donation
party every, year; but he hoped Mr. Scrantum's request
would be granted unanimously for his part, he'd
long ben of opinion they'd ought to have a <i>cheaper</i>
minister, and one that hadn't such a snarl o' young
ones. I don't s'pose Parson Scrantum would a said
any thing severe if it hadent a ben for Cappen Smalley's
speech. He seemed quite stirred up by it. He
riz up considerable flustrated, and says he&mdash;"I thank
God, that what ever else I lack, He has ben pleased to

<!-- page 271 -->

give me plenty o' the <i>poor</i> man's blessins&mdash;yea, a
quiver full of them. And it's for their sakes, not
my own, that I come here to-night. If I was alone in
the world, I could and would dew on a'most nothing&mdash;though
Scripter says the laborer is worthy of his
hire. Brethren, since I come among you, I've done
my best to be a faithful pastor&mdash;if I've failed I hope
to be forgiven. At first I had an idee that I should
be able to rub along, on my small salary; and I don't
know, but I might a done it, if it hadn't a ben for
<i>one thing</i>." Here he paused. "What was <i>that</i>?" says
Deacon Peabody. Mr. Scrantum continued&mdash;"I've
ben here tew years, and you've had the kindness to
give me tew donation parties. I've stood it so fur,
but I can't stand it no longer; brethren, I feel convinced
that <i>one more donation party</i> would completely
<i>break me down</i>, I will now retire and leave the meetin'
to decide as they see fit." Yer uncle said that for
about five minutes after he went out universal silence
prevailed. The first to speak was Deacon Skinner.
"Strange!" says he. "Curus!" says Deacon Peabody.
"<i>Ree</i>markable!" says Deacon Fustick. "Onaccountable!"
says Cappen Smalley. "Singular circumstance!"
says Dr Lippincott. Then yer uncle got up,
and, says he&mdash;" Gentlemen, I don't see as any thing's
to be gained by settin' here and wonderin' all night.
For my part, I think all Parson Scrantum's said
is true&mdash;his request is perfectly reasonable&mdash;and I

<!-- page 272 -->

move it be put to vote." So 'twas put to vote and
granted.</p>

<p>A few days afterward the minister's folks packed
up and started off for Miss Scrantum's father's, to stay
till they could git another place. Yer uncle gin 'em
ten dollars when they went. He'd a ben glad to give
fifty if he'd a ben able. They was very thankful
for't, and the parson gin us his partin' blessin', and I'd
ruther have <i>that</i> than all Cappen Smalley's money.
We all felt bad enough when we said good-by. Miss
Scrantum cried hard&mdash;she dident try to conceal her
feelins then. Susan cried tew, and so did I&mdash;and we
had a gineral time kissin' all round; as true as I live,
Jeff, he kissed Susan tew&mdash;but don't you teaze him
about it; I was glad to see him dew it, though Susan
did blush awfully. They made us promise to come
and see 'em if ever they got another sittiwation.
We've heerd lately that the parson had got a call to
Bangtown. I don't know nothin' about the village,
but I hope to gracious it's a place where <i>donation parties</i>
is a thing unknown.</p>

<h3>XXIV.</h3>

<h3>Aunt Maguire's Treats of the Contemplated Sewing
Society at Scrabble Hill.</h3>

</div>

<p>WE're a gwine to have a Sewin' Society at
Scrabble Hill. Miss Birsley, lawyer Birsley's
wife, was the first one that proposed it. She hain't
lived here but about a year, and she's always ben
used to such societies where she come from, so she
felt as if she'd like to have one here. Miss Birsley's
jest the woman to take hold o' any such thing. She's
a wonderful active little body, and a real good woman
tew. But, above all, she's got a way o' sayin' jest
what she pleases to every body without even givin' any
offense. I've often wondered how it was that Miss
Birsley could speak her mind so freely and never
make no enemies by it. Why, if I should venter to
talk half so plain as she does I should be univarsally
hated. But she comes right out with every thing
she thinks, and yet she's more popilar than any
other woman in the place. I guess it must be because
folks has found out that she never says no wuss
about 'em to their backs than she says to their faces.

<!-- page 274 -->

Well, she come into our house one day last week (she
and I's very good friends); she come in and axed me
how I'd like to jine a Sewin' Society for benevolent
purposes? I told her that not knowin' I couldent
say, for I hadent never belonged to none. So she
went into an explanation; and after I understood the
natur of 'em I liked the idee, and said I'd go in for
it. So she wanted me to go round with her and talk
it up to the folks; and as I dident see no reason why
I shouldent, I put on my things and off we started.
The first place we went to was the minister's&mdash;we
thought we'd like to see what Miss Tuttle thought
about it afore we spoke to any body else. Well, Miss
Tuttle said she approved o' sowin' societies&mdash;she
thought they was quite useful when they was properly
conducted. She dident know how the plan would
work here&mdash;at any rate, it was well enough to try,
and she'd be glad to help us all she was able to.</p>

<p>Next we went to Deacon Skinner's. The Widder
Grimes and Charity was there spendin' the day, so we
discussed the pint with 'em all. Miss Skinner and
the gals seemed quite took with the idee; but Charity
and her mother rather hesitated at first, but after
they'd axed forty questions, and we'd told 'em all
about it, and they'd satisfied themselves that they
could git along without givin' any thing more than
their time for an hour or tew a week, and git their
tea to boot, they agreed to jine. So Miss Birsley took

<!-- page 275 -->

down their names. We dident conclude what we
should dew with the avails o' our labor&mdash;thought
we'd discuss that matter at the first meetin', and Miss
Birsley said she'd have 'em meet to her house the
next week a Wensday.</p>

<p>When we come away from there, I says, says I,
"We mustn't forgit to go to see Liddy Ann Buill."
"O yes," says Miss Birsley, "the old maid that keeps
the milliner's shop." Now I hadent the least idee
she'd jine, but I know'd she never'd forgive us if we
dident call on her. She's a curus critter&mdash;consates
that some folks feels above her, and it makes her wonderful
oncomfortable. She's always on a look out for
slights and insults, and o' course she thinks she gits
plenty on 'em. She hates Deacon Fustick's wife like
pizen, on account o' some remarks she heerd o' Miss
Fustick's makin' about the ostridge feathers she wore
on her bunnit winter afore last. Miss Fustick said
afore old Miss Crocker, that she thought Liddy Ann
Buill was tew old to wear plumes. Old mother
Crocker went straight and told Liddy Ann on't, and
she was hoppin' mad about it. She went round
talkin' about Miss Fustick at a terrible rate. Of
course, Miss Fustick talked back agin, and it led to
an awful quarrel that ain't made up yet. That bunnit
<i>was</i> a curiosity though. Blue velvet with a couple o'
great long yaller feathers tipped with pink on't, and
red flowers in the inside. "I know she won't jine,"

<!-- page 276 -->

says I; "but we may as well call, for she'll be awful
mad if we don't." "I guess I can manage her," says
Miss Birsley. "I know she thinks I feel above her,
but I'll see ef I can't convince her she mistaken."
So in we goes&mdash;Liddy Ann was a sewin' a straw
bunnit. She's ginerally pretty perlite to me&mdash;I s'pose
she thinks I ain't proud;&mdash;but when she see me long
o' Miss Birgley, she thought I'd naturally feel ruther
lifted up (bein' as Miss Birsley belongs to the upper
crust), and so she'd treat me accordin'ly. She looked
up when we come in, and gin us a wonderful stiff
bow&mdash;never laid by her sewin'&mdash;dident even ax us to
sit down&mdash;but there she sot, head up, nose in the air
(she's got a sing'lar way o' turnin' up her nose at
folks), with a real I'm-as-good-as-you-be look on her
face, and sewed away as if her life depended on't. I
felt ruther aukerd, but Miss Birsley dident seem to.
She looked down into the show-box that sot on the
counter, and says she, "What a beautiful assortment
o' ribbins&mdash;you've jest got 'em up, hain't you, Miss
Buill?" "I have," says Liddy Ann. "That green
and white plaid one's a beauty," says Miss Birsley&mdash;"Won't
you please to let me look at it?" "Can't
you lift the kiver and take it out yerself?" says Liddy
Ann, says she. "O yes, to be sure," says Miss
Birsley&mdash;"I dident know as I might." So she took
it out and admired it wonderfully. "What a firm
stout ribbin it is tew?" says she&mdash;"Why, Miss Buill,

<!-- page 277 -->

you make better selections than the merchants dew."
"When <i>I</i> buy ribbins I buy <i>ribbins</i>, and not shavin's,"
says Liddy Ann. "So I see," says Miss Birsley.
"I'll take three yards on't, if you please." I wondered
whether the critter'd condescend to git up and
wait on her&mdash;but she couldent help it&mdash;so she riz with
a great deal o' dignity and measured it off. Miss
Birsley paid for't; and then she happened to notice a
straw bunnit that laid on the shelf&mdash;'twas one that
Liddy Ann had been dewin' over for Loanthy Pettibone&mdash;"How
white this bunnit is!" says she&mdash;"I
don't see how you can make old straw look so nice."
"When I bleech hats I <i>bleech</i> 'em," says Liddy Ann;
"I don't <i>tan</i> 'em." "So I perceive," says Miss Birsley,
says she&mdash;"but I declare I'd a'most forgot my arrand&mdash;we're
a tryin' to raise a Sewin' Society, Miss Buill,
and we called to see whether you wouldent jine?"
"Me!" says Liddy Ann, lookin' a leetle grain
pleasanter'n she did afore&mdash;"well, I don't know&mdash;I'm
fearful you won't succeed in yer undertakin'."
"Why not?" says I. "O," says she, "society here
ain't united as it ought to be&mdash;indiwiddiwals don't
pull together at all." "Well, then," says Miss Birsley,
"mabby a Sewin' Society would be the means o'
makin' 'em more united&mdash;it promotes good feelin' to
meet together and work for some benevolent objict&mdash;makes
folks take an interest in one another, you
know." "O, but 'twouldent be the case here," says

<!-- page 278 -->

Liddy Ann; "there's tew much rastocratical feelin'&mdash;some
o' the members would carry their heads so
high, and think themselves so much better'n some
others; and them others would <i>know they</i> was jest as
good as the rest&mdash;for my part, shouldent want to put
myself in the way o' bein' put down and stompt on
afterward by Deacon Fustick's wife and such." Miss
Birsley, she raised her hands and eyes, and says she,
"The land alive!&mdash;well, I declare, if I ain't beat now
to hear you go on at such a rate, Miss Buill! You
look well a talkin' about aristocracy when you've got
more on't than anybody else in the village. Why, I
always thought you was very proud and haughty;
and I guess it's the general impression that you feel
above your neighbors. I was half afeared to come in
here to-day, you've always been so scornful toward
me; but now I am here, I feel as if I must speak
plainly&mdash;and I'll tell you <i>what</i>, if you raly want
society to be united, you must be the first to set the
example. You must lay aside some o' yer pride, and
consent to associate with yer neighbors on equil tirms."
(Liddy Ann's nose come down a peg, and she raly
looked quite gratified. Thinks me, these ere folk
that's forever a blazin' away about aristocracy, are
always willin' enough to have the name o' bein' aristocrats
themselves, and would be so actilly if they had
a chance). Miss Birsley went on&mdash;"Now, if you're
sincere in what you say, do, for pity's sake, show it

<!-- page 279 -->

by comin' to the Sewin' Society. We expect all the
other girls'll come&mdash;the Skinners have agreed to, and
we intend to call on the rest, and no doubt they'll
jine." Liddy Ann's nose come down another peg to
hear herself classed with the <i>girls</i>. She looked eny
most good-natered. "Well, I'll see about it," says
she&mdash;"but why don't you take some cheers and set
down?" "Because you hain't invited us tew," says
Miss Birsley. "Dear me," says Liddy Ann, "how
forgitful I be!" "No matter," says Miss Birsley,
"we can't stay to set down now&mdash;but you <i>will</i> jine us,
won't you? we depend a great deal on your taste, and
the other girls all seem to give up to you in that respect."
Liddy Ann fairly dropt her nose to a level
with other folkses, and actilly smiled, and says she&mdash;"Well,
takin' all things into consideration, I ruther
guess I <i>will</i> jine." So Miss Birsley took down her
name, and told her not to fail to attend the first
meetin' at her house next Wensday. She promised
she'd come; and then she went to the door with us
mighty gracious, and hoped we'd call on her agin.
After we'd got on a piece, says I, "Well I dew say
for't, I never was more beat in all my born days than
I was to see you git round that cross-grained old
critter as you did! I dident know afore that you ever
used any <i>soft soap</i>, but I'm sure you daubed it onto
Liddy Ann right and left; 'twas the best way after
all though, for if you'd a took her to task about bein'

<!-- page 280 -->

jealous and suspicious, she'd a ben tearin' mad, and
like enough showed us the door, and then went round
and jawed about us afterward." "Jest so," says Miss
Birsley, "the only way to deal with such folks is to
try to make them satisfied with themselves; make 'em
think you look upon 'em as persons o' some consequence,
and they'll dew any thing you want 'em tew;
and then, tew, there's a satisfaction in it, because it
makes 'em feel so much more comfortable and good-natered."</p>

<p>The next place we went to was Dr. Lippincott's.
Miss Lippincott was pleased with the idee of a Sewin'
Society, and said she'd jine. Anny Mariar sot there
a playin' on the pianner, and we axed her if she
wouldent take hold and help us? "Dear me, no!"
says she; "I can't bear to sew, and, besides, I don't
understand it. I never had to sew any." "How old
are you?" says Miss Birsley. "Eighteen," says Anny
Mariar. "The land alive!" says Miss Birsley, "eighteen
year old and don't know how to sew!&mdash;and you
can set there and tell on't without blushin'! Why
what's yer ma ben thinkin' about all this time to neglect
yer eddication so? I declare, I must tell Dick o'
that; I shan't allow him to git interested in a young
lady that don't know how to sew"&mdash;(Dick was her
nephew; he was a studyin' law with Mr. Birsley, and
was quite attentive to Anny Mariar.) "Well," she
went on, "it's high time you larnt, and if you'll come

<!-- page 281 -->

to the Sewin' Society, I'll engage to teach you."
Miss Birsley said all this in a pleasant, good-natered
way, but Miss Lippincott felt it, and so did Anny Mariar.
I guess she begun to suspect that, after all,
'twa'n't so wonderful lady-like not to know how to
sew. She promised she'd attend the meetin' next
week. "That's good," says Miss Birsley; "but don't
for pity's sake, wear all them petticoats, for I don't
think ther'll be room for 'em if the meetin's large."</p>

<p>When we come from there, we started for Deacon
Fustick's and while we was a crossin' the road we observed
Cappen Smalley a standin' in his store door.
"There's the cappen," says Miss Birsley, " now we'll
go in and make him give us something to begin with."
"Gracious sakes!" says "I, "I hope you don't expect
to squeeze any thing out o' him?" "To be sure I
dew," says she. "Well, you'll find yerself mistaken,"
says I; "for he never gives nothing to no objict&mdash;always
takes it out in talkin'." "You see'f I don't
make him hand over," says she. When the cappen
see us a comin' he went in so's to be ready to wait on
us. "Cappen," says Miss Birsley, "we hain't come
to trade to-day; we've come on bizness. We ladies
are thinkin' o' startin' a Sewin' Society for benevolent
objicts, and it's quite important to git the opinion o'
the leadin' men o' the place afore we begin. What do
you think o' the plan, cappen?" "A capital plan,"
says he, "a most excellent idee. I've long been of

<!-- page 282 -->

opinion that somethin' o' the kind was needed here&mdash;it's
a great satisfaction to be laborin' for the good of
our feller-critters. To what partickler purpouse do
you intend to devote the avails o' yer labor?" "Well,"
says she, "we hain't decided yet; we shall wait till
we git started, and then consider the matter&mdash;ther's
enough ways o' dewin' good with money, you know."
"Exactly," says the cappen, says he, "and I would
suggest the idee o' your expendin' yer funds in the
purchase of articles o' clothin' for the poor; ther's a
great number in destitute circumstances in this place,
and it strikes me it would be a great satisfaction to the
ladies to furnish 'em with comfortable apparril."
"That <i>is</i> a good idee," says Miss Birsley&mdash;"don't you
think so. Miss Maguire?" "Yes," says I. "I'm glad
it strikes you favorably," says the cappen, says he;
"and come to think, I have on hand a variety o' materials
that would be suitable to make garments for the
poor; and if you see fit to purchase, I'll let you have
'em at first cost, seein' it's for a benevolent objict. In
such cases it's always a satisfaction to me to sell low."
"You're very kind," says Miss Birsley, "we'll mention
it at the meetin'; but we've got to have some funds to
begin with. You can give us something, I s'pose?"
"Well, raly," says the cappen, says he, rubbin' his
hands together, "I'm very sorry, very, indeed, that
it's happened so. It's very inconvenient jest now&mdash;in
fact, it's onpossible for me to give any thing at this

<!-- page 283 -->

time. I have a large remittance to make very soon to
New York, and, of course I can't spare a penny. We
men o' bizness that have large outstandin' debts are
often more put to't for ready money than a day-laborer&mdash;it's
very vexatious, very, indeed." "Yes," says
Miss Birsley, "it <i>must</i> be so&mdash;it must be very tryin'
to you to be scant o' money when you have a call to
contribbit, it's such a <i>satisfaction</i> to you to give "&mdash;(here
she gin me a hunch)&mdash;"but that don't make no
difference to us, we'd jest as live take something out
o' the store&mdash;for instance, some o' this ere cotton cloth&mdash;(and
she stept up to a pile o' shirtin' that laid on the
counter)&mdash;"you'd esteem it a privilege to give us a
piece o' this." "But&mdash;but," says the cappen, "I
raly don't feel." "Now, cappen," says Miss Birsley,
"you needent apologize a word, this is very nice cloth
and it'll be jest as good to us as money&mdash;it'll make first
rate shirts, and we can always find ready market for
good shirts." "But," says he, "consider a minnit&mdash;a
piece o' shirtin' is&mdash;" "O now, don't talk so, cappen,"
says she; "a piece o' shirtin's jest exactly as good as
any thing else, and we'd jest as live have it as the
money; for if we had the money we should have to
spend it to buy materials to begin on. We know
'twould be more of a <i>satisfaction</i> to you to give us
five dollars if 'twas convenient; but seein' it ain't,
we're perfectly willin' to take this.&mdash;so jest please to
dew it up;" so she picked out one o' the best pieces

<!-- page 284 -->

and tumbled it down toward him. The cappen he
looked awful womblecropt&mdash;I declare, I raly pitied the
poor man&mdash;he hesitated a minnit, and then, can you
believe it? he actilly took the cloth and done it up!&mdash;but
I tell ye, I never see such an oncomfortable lookin'
countenance as his'n while he was a dewin' on't.
"Now," says Miss Birsley, "I'll trouble you to write
on't&mdash;'Thirty-one yards shirtin' presented to the Ladies'
Sewin' Society by Captain Smalley.' " So he
took a pen and writ it, and I'll be hanged if he dident
look as if he was a signin' his own death warrant.
"Much obleeged to ye," says Miss Birsley, and she
took up the cloth and we come off. When we got to
the door, she turned round, and says she, "Mabby it
will be a <i>satisfaction</i> to ye, cappen, to buy some o' the
shirts after we git 'em made?" The cappen he gin a
ghastly grin, and a peculiar kind of a bow as much as
to say&mdash;"You see'f you ketch me agin," and so we
bid him good-afternoon, and left him to his meditations.
"Well," says I, "I'll give it up now!&mdash;if I
hadent a seen it with my own eyes, I never'd a believed
it, never! How astonished every body'll be
when they hear on't?" "Yes," says Miss Birsley;
"but we mustent let on how we got it out of him&mdash;'tain't
right to tell o' such things&mdash;we must let folks
think he gin it of his own accord." "Jest so," says I;
but, thinks me, it's tew good to keep, and I <i>must</i> tell
Mr. <i>Godey</i> on't, though I won't mention it to any body

<!-- page 285 -->

else. Well, it was a pretty heavy load to carry, and
Miss Birsley proposed we should take it into her husband's
office and leave it. The office was nigh by, so
we goes in. Miss Birsley huv it down, and says she
to her nephew, "There, Dick, I want you to bring
that up when you come home to-night." Squire Birsley
looked at it and read the writin', and says he,
"You don't mean to say that Cappen Smalley gin you
this?" "To be sure he did," says she; "don't you
believe his own words?" "Pretty cunnin' in you,"
says the squire, "to git it in writin', for fear he'd be
down on yer society with a bill." "O law!" says she,
"jest as if I done it for that." Dick Wilson he looked
up kind o' knowin', and says he, "It <i>takes you to
come it</i>, Aunt Lucy."</p>

<p>Next we went to Deacon Fustick's. Miss Fustick
and Jane Elizy had gone to Deacon Peabody's to tea,
so we went round there, and had a chance to see 'em
all at once. Miss Peabody's entirely governed by
Miss Fustick in every thing, so she waited to see what
Miss Fustick would say afore she expressed her opinion
about the Sewin' Society; and Miss Fustick don't
want to go into any thing without she can be head
man, and as she wasn't sure how she'd stand in the
Sewin' Society, she hesitated a spell. At last she said
she had her doubts about it&mdash;dident like to undertake
a thing till she was convinced 'twould promote the
interests o' religion&mdash;(Miss Fustick's awful pious

<!-- page 286 -->

cordin' to <i>her</i> idees o' piety.) Of course, Miss Peabody
had <i>her</i> doubts tew, about jinin' the society.
Miss Birsley and me, we both said tew 'em that we'd
no doubt but what the Sewin' Society would be the
means o' dewin' a great deal o' good if 'twas properly
conducted. Well, Miss Fustick said she was onsartin'
about bein' able to attend&mdash;her time was pretty much
took up&mdash;she was Superintendent o' the Maternal Society,
President o' the Daughters o' Temperance, and
Gorrespondin' Secretary to the Friends o' Humanity,
and she was afeard she couldent consistently do much
for the Sewin' Society; but she'd try to attend occasionally&mdash;at
least she'd make it a subject o' prayer,
and try to find out what was <i>duty</i> in the case. Of
course, Miss Peabody said she'd try to attend tew&mdash;and
then we axed ther daughters whether they'd come?
Sophrony Peabody inquired whether the gentlemen
was a gwine to attend? We said that hadent been
thought of yet.  And Jane Elizy Fustick said she
hoped in all favor they wouldent&mdash;if they did, <i>she</i>
wouldent any how&mdash;she couldent bear to have the fellers
stickin' round. "Why can't you speak the
truth," says Miss Birsley, "and say you won't come
<i>without</i> they do?" At last they both said they'd jine.</p>

<p>Next, we went into Jo Gipson's, and there we found
Tom Hodges' wife a visitin' with her young one. Of
all the children I ever see, that boy's the disagreeablest;
but his mother don't think so. She makes a

<!-- page 287 -->

natral fool of him&mdash;always takes him every where
with her, and it takes every body in the house to attend
to him. He was a settin' on his mother's lap eatin'
an awful great hunk o' cake, makin' a dretful growlin'
noise over it that any most prevented our hearin'
one another talk. After we'd discussed the Sewin'
Society with the ladies, and they'd both said they'd
jine, Miss Birsley says to the young one, "Come here
and see me, bub." "Me won't!" says he. "He'd
ruther stay by his mommy, hadent he, darlin'?" says
Miss Hodge. "Stay there, then, if you want to, little
cross-patch," says Miss Birsley. I felt ruther sorry to
hear her speak out so, so I says, "What's yer name,
ducky?" "Nun o' oo bidness!" says he. "O now,"
says his mother, "can't he be a little man and tell the
lady his name?" "Me won't!" says he, and he hit
his mother a slap in the face, "Now that ain't pritty,"
says she; "mommy'll cry," so she put her hands
up to her face and pretended to cry; After a spell,
says she, "Now tell the lady his name nice and pritty,
and then mommy'll stop cryin'." But instid o' tellin'
his name, he begun to bawl for more cake. "Wait a
minnit. Miss Gipson," says Miss Hodge, "I want the
ladies to hear him tell his name, he says it so sweet
and cunnin'. Now tell the lady his name, and then
he shall have more cake." "Yando Puffle Hogs,"
says the little torment. "That's a darlin'," says his
mother&mdash;"now, Miss Gipson may git him a great big

<!-- page 288 -->

piece o' cake." "What did he say his name was?"
says Miss Birsley. "Orlando Percival Hodge," says
his mother. "The land alive!" says Miss Birsley, "I
declare I don't blame the young one for not wantin'
to tell his name." "What! don't you like it?" says
Miss Hodge. "No," says Miss Birsley; "I don't admire
double names any way, especially such awful
jaw-breakers as that." "Why how you talk," says
Miss Hodge, "for my part, I think boys names always
ought to be double. I told his pa I wanted to give
him a name that would sound well in Congress one o'
these days, and I think 'Orlando P. Hodge' will."
"The land alive!" says Miss Birsley, "I s'pose you
think that Henry Clay'd be a much greater man if
his name was Henry P. Clay. And George Washington,
tew, no doubt he'd a made a great deal more
noise in the world if his name had a ben George P.
Washington. What a pity 'twa'n't&mdash;but you needent
be calculatin' on seein' your boy a member o' Congress&mdash;his
name'll be the death of him afore he comes to
maturity. Did you ever consider that 'twas O. P.
H.?" "Gracious!" says Miss Hodge, "it never struck
me afore." "Miss Birsley," says I, "it's time for us
to go." "So 'tis," says she. "Well, ladies, we shall
expect to see you at the meetin' next Wensday; but
Miss Hodge, don't you bring O. P. H., for I shan't
have time to stuff him."</p>

<p>Well, from there, we went over to Professor Stubbleses

<!-- page 289 -->

to present the case to Miss Stubbles and Jerushy.
Miss Stubbles is quite a clever woman, and a
good member o' society as fur as she dares to be; but
she's dretfully under the Professor's thumb, and he's
a wonderful curus man; he's got some o' the oddest
notions in his head that ever you heerd of&mdash;thinks
that property ought to be equilly divided&mdash;calls all
rich men oppressors, and all the laborin' class abused
and deprived o' their rights&mdash;holds that men and wimmin
ought to be eddicated jest alike. He's always a
whalin' away about the dignity o' labor&mdash;has jest ben
deliverin' a course o' lecters on the subjict, and he calls
all men that don't take hold and dew kitchen work,
domestic tyrants; but he has such a blind, twistical
way o' talkin', that a body can't tell what he means
half the time&mdash;husband says he don't know himself
what he's a drivin' at. When we got there, Miss
Stubbles was in the side yard a splittin' wood; she
come round and went in with us. They hadent no
fire only in the kitchen, so she took us in there. The
professor was a churnin'&mdash;I thought I should go off
when I see him. He's a great, tall, lank, ongainly
man, and there he stood with a check apron on, a
churnin' away like fury&mdash;he <i>did</i> look like old Time.
Their overgrown gawkey son, Nathan, was a settin'
the tea-table. There's somethin' wonderful quizzical
about the boy's looks. His clus is a great deal tew
small for him, and he looks as if he was jest a gwine

<!-- page 290 -->

to bust out of 'em like a chicken out o' the shell. He
looked wonderful sober a settin' the table; but they
say he's up to all sorts o' tricks away from home.
We inquired for Jerushy, and they said she'd gone
to milk. Well, we told our bizness, and axed Miss
Stubbles if she'd jine the society? She looked at the
Professor to see how he took it afore she answered us&mdash;so
I says, says I, "What do <i>you</i> think o' the plan,
Professor Stubbles?" The Professor giv three or four
awful <i>hams</i> to clear out his throat, and then says he,
"Did I believe that an organization of this description
would be a labor-promotin' association, I would
give it my heart-willing approval." "No doubt it
will be so," says Miss Birsley. "Ladies," says he, "it
is high time that the dignity of labor was appreciated
world-wide." (We see he was in for a speech, so we
let him go on.) "It's high time that the purse-proud
and vice-bloated aristocracy o' the land was compelled
to toil like the hard-handed sons and daughters of
honest poverty;&mdash;it's high time that the artificial arrangements
of society was done away, and this sin-distracted,
folly-bewildered, hag-ridden world was
governed by such laws as the Great Heart of the universe
originally intended. Ladies, the earth-mission
of mundane souls is twofold; first, to discharge with
self-interest-sacrificing zeal our duty toward down-trodden
humanity; second, to perform with soul-earnest,
wife-assisting, daughter-helping, labor-loving fidelity,

<!--

"Here the churn-dasher come down with such a vengeance, that the cream
spirted up and spattered all round." page 291.

-->

<!-- page 291 -->

such domestic services as shall be to be performed at
home; and I pronounce that soul who refuses to acknowledge
the dignity of household labor, a pride-besotted,
contempt-deserving, heaven-provoking churl."
Here the churn-dasher come down with such a vengeance,
that the cream spirted up and spattered all
round, and some on't went onto Miss Birsley's shawl.
"The land alive!" says she, "that was dignified, any
how." Miss Stubbles jumped up to clean it off. "Set
still, Miss Stubbles," says Miss Birsley, "it's the Professor's
bizness to repair the mischief. Come, Professor,
git a wet cloth and wipe off my shawl afore the
grease soaks in." The Professor looked mad and
dident stir. "Well," says she, "accordin' to what
you jest advanced, you must own yerself to be a pride-besotted
wretch. Now, Professor, I should like to
know if it wouldn't be ruther more dignified for you
to go out and split wood, than 'tis to make yer wife
do it while you stay in the kitchen and churn?
Wouldn't it be quite as dignified to send that great
able-bodied boy to the pastur' to milk, as 'tis to make
Jerushy go? It kind o' seems to me as if labor wa'n't
dignified only when it's done by the right persons,
and in the right time and place. It seems to me as
if it's the best way for every body to dew ther duty
in the station where Providence has placed 'em&mdash;mabby
it's an <i>artificial arrangement</i>, but it strikes me
as ruther a good one." The Professor looked quite

<!-- page 292 -->

beat, and begun to <i>ham</i> and clear his throat, and I see
he was a preparin' to let off another speech, so I says
to Miss Birsley, "Come, it's time we was a gwine."
So we riz to come away, and Miss Birsley says she,
"Well, Professor Stubbles, I s'pose you'll be offended
if I don't invite you and Nathan to come to the Sewin'
Society and help us, but as my idees respectin' the
dignity' o' labor differ from yourn, I think I'd a leetle
ruther have Miss Stubbles and Jerushy come." The
Professor looked real wrathy, but dident say nothing,
and we left him a churnin' away for dear life.</p>

<p>Well, the next day we went to the Parkers, and the
Billinses, and the Stillman's, and the Pettibone's, and
all round; but 'twould take tew long to go over with
the hull genealogy of all the calls we made. Enough
to say, we found most every body agreeable to the
plan; and when they wa'n't in favor on't, Miss Birsley
argyd 'em into't&mdash;so she sent a notice to Parson
Tuttle, and yesterday he giv it out in meetin', requestin'
all the ladies o' the congregation to meet next
Wensday afternoon at the house of Squire Birsley,
for the purpose of organizin' a Sewin' Society for benevolent
objicts.</p>

<h3>XXV.</h3>

<h3>Aunt Maguire Continues her Account of the
Sewing Society.</h3>

</div>

<p>I WISH to gracious you could attend one of our
Sewin' Society meetin's. You never se nothin'
to beat 'em, I'll be bound for't. We've had tew now.
At the first one, at Squire Birsley's, ther was twenty-five
present. Miss Birsley had got some shirts cut
out o' Cappen Smalley's cloth, and as fast as they
come in she sot 'em to work&mdash;at least she gin 'em
some work, but ther was so much talkin' to dew ther
was precious little sewin' done. Ther tongues went a
good deal faster 'n ther fingers did, and the worst on't
was, they was all a runnin' at once. Ther was an
everlastin' sight o' talkin', but it did seem as if they
wouldent never come to no decision in creation.
'Twa'n't expected we should dew much at the first
meetin' more 'n to elect the managers, and make up
our minds how often we should meet&mdash;and I begun
to think we shouldent dew even that much, there was
such o' sight o' discussin' and disputin' about every
thing. Some was for meetin' once a week, and some

<!-- page 294 -->

thought 'twas altogether too often. Some was for
stayin' to tea, and some was opposed to't. Some
thought 'twould be a good plan to stay and work
evenin's, and some was of opinion 'twouldn't pay,
bein' as we'd have to burn so many candles and lamps.
Ther wa'n't nothing said about what object we'd work
for at the first meetin'&mdash;thought we'd leave that till
next time.</p>

<p>Well, we talked and talked and talked, and the upshot
on't was, Miss Birsley was appinted <i>president</i>&mdash;Miss
Ben Stillman, Miss Dr. Lippincott and Miss Deacon
Fustick, <i>managers</i>&mdash;Polly Mariar Stillman <i>secretary</i>,
and Liddy Ann Buill, <i>treasurer</i>. Moreover, we
agreed to meet once a fortnight; at tew o'clock in the
afternoon, stay to tea and work till dark. When we'd
got through with our bisness, we had tea&mdash;quite a
plain tea. Miss Birsley don't approve o' makin'
much fuss for Sewin' Society&mdash;because if ye dew,
ther'll be some that'll feel as if they couldent afford
to have it to their houses. She dident give us but
one kind o' cake, but 'twas light and good, and so
was the bread; and we had sliced meat and cheese.
Miss Birsley dident say nothing about it but she hoped
the rest would foller her example. I made up my
mind <i>I</i> would any how, whether the rest did or not.</p>

<p>Well the ladies all eat as if they liked it, and they
praised up every thing at a wonderful rate. They
<i>never</i> laid tooth to such bread, in all their lives; the

<!-- page 295 -->

butter was superfine; the cold meat was <i>delicious</i>; and
for the cake it <i>was</i> a mystery to them how Miss Birsley
managed to <i>always</i> have such first-rate cake.
Miss Deacon Peabody declared she'd eat such a hearty
supper she was afeard she should be sick. After tea,
Miss Jo Gripson invited us to meet at their house next
time, and then we went hum. While we was in the
bed-room' a puttin' on our things, I heerd Miss Peabody
whisper to Miss Stillman and say, "Did you ever
see any thing to beat that tea in all your born days?
No presarves at all!" "I never did," says Miss Stillman.
"If I can't give 'em a better tea when they
meet to our house, I'll give up."</p>

<p>Well, at the next meetin' ther was about the same
number present, and we talked up what we'd dew
with the money. The difficulty was, the members
couldent agree upon nothin'&mdash;some wanted to work
for <i>this</i> objict, and some wanted to work for <i>that</i>.
Miss Skinner and some o' the rest thought we'd ought
to sew for the missionaries, but most on 'em opposed
it, 'cause they wanted to <i>see</i> what become o' the money.
Miss Stubbles thought 'twould be a good plan to establish
a school for the colored sect&mdash;I s'pose the Professor
put her up to't&mdash;but nobody else dident seem
to be in favor on't; and Sister Bedott (she attended),
she said <i>she</i> never'd agree to that, 'twould be money
throw'd away, for niggers would be niggers, dew what
ye would to elevate 'em. Miss Fustick (she come in

<!-- page 296 -->

and got a spell with her things on&mdash;said she couldent
stay long, jest dropped in on her way to the Matarnal
Society, meetin'), she thought we couldent dew better'n
to give the avails of our labor to the "Sons o' Temperance."
"Sons o' yer granny," says Liddy Ann
Buill, says she (you know she and' Miss Fustick's a
quarrelin'.) When she spoke up so, Miss Fustick
looked awful mad, and got up to go: when she reached
the door, she turned round and says she, "Perhaps
Miss Buill would ruther work for the 'Old Maids'
Consolation Society' that they talk o' formin'. Good
afternoon, ladies!" and off she cut afore Liddy Ann
had time to answer. The gals all tittered, and Liddy
Ann lookt wonderful womblescropt. I don't know
but she'd a cleared out if Miss Birsley hadent a
smoothed it over in her cunnin' way; she laughed,
and says she, "What, Miss Buill, you gals don't mean
to help the old maids I hope? I say let 'em take
care o' themselves." Liddy Ann grinned and looked
quite satisfied.</p>

<p>Well, they talked and talked and talked, jest as
they did at the first meetin', to no more purpose neither
only to git more ryled up than they did then. It
seemed as if every one had got a partickler pint to
carry and was detarmined the rest should yield to't.
I tried a number o' times to make a proposition I'd
thought on, but ther was so many that talked louder
and faster'n what I could, that I couldent for the life

<!-- page 297 -->

o' me git nobody to listen tew me. At last I went to
Miss Birsley and told her my idee, and axed her what
she thought on't. She said she liked the notion.
"Well, then, you propose it," says I, "for I can't git
'em to listen to me if I try till Doomsday." So she
spoke out, and says she, "Ladies!" but ther was such
a racket nobody dident hear her. So she tried agin:
"Ladies, I say!" but still they dident' pay no attention.
Then she took the tongs and knockt on the stove as
loud as ever she could. "Order!" says she. They
stoppt talkin' then, and lookt round to see what she
wanted. "Ladies," says she, "Miss Magwire has proposed
an object to work for that strikes me as an excellent
one. She thinks we'd better raise enough to
repair the meetin'-house, and for my part, I think, we
couldent dew better: the meetin'-house is in a miserable
condition; the plasterin's a comin' off in ever so
many places, and the pulpit's a forlorn old thing,
away up in the air; it's enough to break a body's neck
to look at the minister, and shakes like an old eggshell.
Mr. Tuttle says he's a'most afeard to go into
it. Don't you think 'twould be a good plan to tear
it down and build another? Now don't all speak at
once. We never shall dew nothing in creation if we
don't have some sort o' order. Miss Skinner, what's
<i>your</i> opinion?"</p>

<p>Well, Miss Skinner was delighted with the idee,
and so was the Grimeses, and the Fosters, and the

<!-- page 298 -->

Peabodys. Miss Peabody said the Baptists and the
Episcopals was all a pintin' at us for lettin' our house
o' worship be in such a condition. Miss John Brewster
said she'd long thought our meetin'-house was a
disgrace to the village; she'd no doubt but what
'twould be an advantage to the cause o' religion to
repair it, for the Widder Pettibone told her how't
if we'd had a dicent meetin'-house <i>she</i> wouldent a
went off and jined the Episcopals, but, she got so
disgusted with the old nasty house and so tired a
stretchin' her neck to see the minister, that she couldent
stan' it no longer.</p>

<p>"The dear me!" says Charity Grimes, "I want to
know if she gives <i>that</i> as a reason! Why, every body
knows she went there 'cause Curnel Dykeman's an
Episcopal."</p>

<p>"Yes," says Polly Mariar Stillman, "I guess it's
ginerally known what took <i>her</i> there."</p>

<p>"She's a wonderful oneasy critter," says Miss Peabody;
"she's ben a Baptist and a Presbyterian, and
now she's an Episcopal. I wonder what she'll be
next."</p>

<p>"Well, it's cause she's a widder," says Glory Ann
Billins. "I never know'd a widder yet but what was
as oneasy as a fish out o' water. I raly believe it's
nat'ral tew 'em."</p>

<p>"Jest so," says Liddy Ann Buill; "widders will be
widders."</p>

<!-- page 299 -->

<p>"Not if they can help it," says I. I was sorry as
soon as I said it, Sister Bedott lookt so mad. I tell
ye she gin me an awful blowin-up when we got hum&mdash;said
every body in the room thought I meant her,
and she dident mean to go to the meetin' no more. I
don't know whether she will or not.</p>

<p>Well, they'd got hold o' the Widder Pettibone, and
they dident let her drop right off: if her ears dident
burn that afternoon, I'm mistaken. Some on 'em got
so engaged talkin' about her they stopt sewin' intirely.
Bymeby Miss Birsley got out o' patience, and knockt
on the stove. "Order!" says she. When they got
still, says she&mdash;"When the ladies have got the Widder
Pettibone sufficiently done up, I'd like to have
'em take hold and dew up ther shirts." "Law me,"
says old Aunt Betsy Crocker, "they ain't a dewin' her
up; they're a pickin' on her tew pieces." Aunt
Betsy ain't no great talker, but when she does speak
she always says somethin' to the pint. She's a real
clever old soul, good to every body, dumb critters and
all. She was disappinted when she was young, so she
hain't never got married; lives all alone; nobody in
the house but her and Gruff, her old dog. She thinks
the world o' Gruff. I went in to see her one evenin'
last winter. Gruff was asleep on a rug behind the
stove, and ther was'a great pan o' vittals setlin' by
him. I thought 'twas somethin' she'd sot there to
warm, so I says, says I, "Ain't you afeared Gruff'll

<!-- page 300 -->

be pokin' his nose into yer meat?" "Law me," says
she, "that's there a purpose for him. I always set
somethin' by him when he goes to bed, so he'll find
it handy if he happens to wake up hungry in the
night." "My sakes," says I, "I wouldent take' all
that pains for a dog." "Law me!" says she, "Gruff
don't know he's a dog&mdash;he thinks he's <i>folks</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, ladies," says Miss Birsley, "if it's a possible
thing, I'd like to have it decided whether we shall
repair the meetin'-house or not. I think we'd better
put it to vote. Them that's in favor on't will please
to signify it by holdin' up their right hand." Well,
all o' the members held up their right hand exceptin'
Miss Ben Stillman and Polly Mariar. "Miss Stillman,"
says Miss Birsley, "I see that you and Polly
Mariar don't hold up yer hands. Don't you approve
of appropriatin' the money for that purpose?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can't say as I disapprove on't," says Miss
Stillman, "but I should think we'd better not be in
a hurry about makin' up our minds what we'll dew
with the money."</p>

<p>"What's the use o' waitin'?" says Miss Birsley.
"For my part, I think we should go ahead with more
sperrit if we had an object fixed on to work for." "I
think so tew," says Miss Stillman; "but, you know,
we'd ought to be unanimous." "Then why don't you
agree with us?" says Miss Birsley; "that's the way
to be unanimous."</p>

<!-- page 301 -->

<p>"I mean," says Miss Stillman, says she, "that we'd
ought to wait till ther's a full meetin' afore we
vote."</p>

<p>"The land alive!" says Miss Birsley, "I don't
know what you call a full meetin' if this ain't
one."</p>

<p>"The fact is," says Polly Mariar, stretchin' her
great mouth from ear to ear and displayin' all her big
teeth&mdash;(Jeff says her mouth looks like an open sepulcher
full o' dead men's bone)&mdash;"the fact is," says she,
"mar and me's of opinion that we hadent ought to
vote till Miss Samson Savage is consulted."</p>

<p>"Miss Samson Savage ain't a member o' the Society,"
says Miss Birsley, "and she don't go to meetin' once
in six months. I don't know what we should want to
consult her for, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"But you know," says Miss Stillman, "her means
is such that she's able to contribbit a great deal to
any object she approves of."</p>

<p>"And we'd ought to be careful about offendin'
her," says Polly Mariar, "for, you know, she withdraw'd
herself from the Baptists because their Sewin'
Society dident dew as she wanted to have 'em."</p>

<p>"Did the Baptists break down after it?" says Miss
Birsley. Jest then the door opened, and in marched
Miss Samson Savage. But afore I go on, I'd ought
to tell you something about her. She's one o'the
<i>big bugs</i> here&mdash;that is, she's got more money than

<!-- page 302 -->

a'most any body else in town. She was a tailoress
when she was a gal, and they say she used to make a
dretful sight o' mischief among the folks where she
sewed. But that was when she lived in Varmount.
When Mr. Savage married her, he was one o' these
ere specilators. Wonderful fellers to make money,
them Varmounters. Husband says they come over the
Green Mountains with a spellin'-book in one hand and
a halter in t'other, and if they can't git a school to
teach, they can steal a hoss. When they first come
to our place, he was a follerin' the tin-peddlin' bisness;
he used to go rumblin' round in his cart from house
to house, and the rich folks ruther turned up their
noses at him, or he consated they did, and it made
him awful wrathy; so he detarmined he'd be richer 'n
any on 'em, and pay 'em off in their own coin. Old
Smith says he's heerd him time and agin make his
boast that he'd ride over all their heads some day&mdash;dident
seem to have no higher eend in view than to
be the richest man in Scrabble Hill. He sot his heart
and soul and body on't, and knowin' how to turn
every cent to the best advantage, and bein' wonderful
sharp at a bargain, he succeeded; every thing he took
hold of prospered, and without actilly bein' what you
could call dishonest, afore many years every body
allowed he was the richest man in the place. So he
built a great big stun house and furnished it wonderful
grand; his wife wouldent have a bit o' furnitewer

<!-- page 303 -->

made here&mdash;nothin' would dew but she must send
away to Philadelphy for't. And such furnitewer was
never seen in the town afore! Such elegant sofys and
cheers and curtins, and ever so, many curus consarns
that I don't know the name of, and I guess she don't
neither. So she sot up for a lady. She was always a
coarse, boisterous, high-tempered critter, and when
her husband grow'd rich, she grow'd pompous and
overbearin'. She made up her mind she'd rule the
roast, no matter what it cost&mdash;she'd be the <i>first</i> in
Scrabble Hill. She know'd she wa'n't a lady by natur
nor by eddication, but she thought mabby other folks
would be fools enough to think she was if she made
a great parade. So she begun by dressin' more, and
givin' bigger parties than any body else. Of course,
them that thinks money's the main thing (and ther's
plenty such here and every where), is ready to flatter
her and make a fuss over her, and approve of all her
dewin's. If ther's any body that <i>won't</i> knuckle tew
her, I tell ye they have, to take it <i>about east</i>. She
abuses 'em to their faces and slanders 'em to their
backs. Such conduct wouldent be put up with in
a poor woman; but them that would be for drummin'
<i>me</i> out o' town if I should act so, is ready to uphold
Miss Samson Savage, and call it <i>independence</i> and
<i>frankness</i> in her. She's got so she prides herself on
it. She says <i>she</i> ain't afeard to tell folks what she
think of 'em&mdash;if <i>she</i> don't like any body, they <i>know</i>

<!-- page 304 -->

it purty soon. Husband says she wouldent think it
no harm to set her neighbor's house a fire if she done
it in the <i>day-time</i>. She shows her independence in
another way sometimes, by riggin' out in old duds
that would disgrace a washerwoman, and trainin' round
town, makin' calls and so forth, sometimes in an old
wagin and sometimes afoot. It tickles her wonderfully
to hear folks whisper as she goes along&mdash;"Jest
see Miss Savage! that'll dew for <i>her</i>, but 'twouldent
do for every body."</p>

<p>When she goes out in company, she 'nopolizes the
hull o' the conversation. She's detarmined that every
body in the room shall have the benefit of all she has
to say. So she talks up so awful loud that she
drownds every body else's voice, and they have to
listen tew her whether or no. I was to a party a spell
ago where she was, and from the minnit she come in&mdash;(thank
fortin' she never comes arly&mdash;always keeps
the tea a waitin' for her)&mdash;I say, from the minnit she
come till it broke up, she talked without ceesation. It
did seem to me as if I should go distracted. In the
course o' the evenin', somebody axed Pardon Pettibone's
wife (she 'twas Katy Carey) to play on the
planner and sing: she's a beautiful player, and I'm
very fond o' hearin' her. When she sot down to the
music, thinks me, Miss Savage <i>will</i> hold her tongue
now, I'm sure. But I was mistaken. <i>She</i> wa'n't a
gwine to be put down by a pianner, not she, so she

<!-- page 305 -->

jest pitched her voice a peg higher and went on with
her stuff&mdash;all about her hired help&mdash;what Bets, the
cook, done; how Suke, the chambermaid, managed,
and how Nab, the washerwoman, carried sail. I
couldent take no sense o' the music at all. Miss Stillman
and Polly Mariar, and a few more, draw'd up
round her and swallered all she said, but some o' the
young folks that wanted to hear the music, lookt as
if they wished Miss Samson Savage was furder.</p>

<p>But it's plain to be seen with all her pretensions
she feels oneasy and oncomfortable the hull time.
I've noticed that yer <i>codfish gentility</i> always dew. She
knows she ain't the <i>ginniwine article</i>, and so she tries
to make up for't in brass and bluster. If any thing
goes on without her bein' head man, she always tries
to put it down. She was gone a journey when the
Sewin' Society was started, and I s'pose she was awful
mad to think we darst to git up such a thing without
consultin' her. Miss Birsley called on her when she
got hum, and axed her to jine. But she said she
wouldent&mdash;she despised Sewin' Societies, dident want
nothin' to dew with 'em. Miss Birsley dident tell nobody
what she said but me; she know'd 'twould
make some o' the wimmin mad and scare the rest&mdash;but
we both know'd 'twouldent be long afore she'd
be pokin' her nose in among us.</p>

<p>Well, as I said afore, she came a marchin' into the
room where we all sot. She's a great, tall, raw-boned

<!-- page 306 -->

woman, and she steps off like a trainer. She had on
a dirty pink sun-bunnit, and an old ragged blue calicer
open-gownd (what Jeff calls a <i>shelaly</i>) over her dress.
She dident so much as say "How-de-dew" to nobody,
but strammed right across the room and sot down;
then she huv her old sun-bunnit onto the floor, and
draw'd a long breath, and says she&mdash;"Well, I vow
I'm tired&mdash;ben round a shoppin', and shoppin's no
small bisness with me. I don't go into a shop and
stan' an hour, and make the clerks haul down all ther
goods, and then buy <i>tew-cents' worth</i>, as some folks
dew"&mdash;here she lookt round at Miss Grimes and
Charity&mdash;"when <i>I</i> trade, I trade to some amount,
and no mistake. I was ruther tired afore I left hum&mdash;had
company to dinner&mdash;dident think o' comin'
here when I come out&mdash;" Caroline Gipson thought
she was a gwine to apologize for her dress, so she says
says she, "Oh, no apologies necessary&mdash;'twas jest as
well to come in as you was." "What!" Says she, "I
hope ye don't think I'd a dressed up if I had a know'd
I was a comin' here?&mdash;not I. I don't believe in riggin'
up to come to a sewin' meetin','as some folks
dew"&mdash;(here she squinted at the Skinners&mdash;they had
on new plaid dresses)&mdash;"but 'tain't every body that
can <i>afford</i> to wear an old double gownd. I says to
Poll, my waitin'-maid, 'Poll,' says I, 'go to the lumber-room
and git my sun-bunnit and my blue calicer
double gownd; I'm a gwine out.' 'Massy sakes!'

<!-- page 307 -->

says Poll says she, 'does Miss Savage know't the
blue double gownd has got one sleeve a'most ripped
out, and the linnin's all tore so't it hangs down below
the outside round the bottom?' 'Poll,' says I, 'if
'twa'n't that you've jest come out o' Pennsylvany
woods, and don't know nothin' about manners yet,
I'd discharge ye on the spot for darin' to question <i>me</i>,
or make any remarks about what I order. I'll forgive
ye this time on account o' yer ignorance, but if
ever you dew it agin you'll git your walkin'-ticket on
short order, as sure as my name's Miss Samson
Savage. Now start yer stumps, and fetch them things
quick meter.' So she fetcht 'em, and I went and
done my shoppin'. On my way hum, it struck me
that you was to meet here to-day, so thinks me, I'll
jest step in and see what they're up tew." "Will
you take some sewin'?" says Miss Birsley. "Not I,"
says she, "till I know what I'm a sewin' for. What
do ye calculate to dew with the money ye raise?"</p>

<p>"We thought," says Miss Birsley, "that is, the
majority of us thought 'twould be a good idee to arn
enough to repair the meetin'-house and build a new
pulpit." "Murder!" says Miss, Savage; "well, I vow
if that wouldent be a worthy object." "So you don't
approve on't, hey?" says Miss Birsley. "Approve
on't?" says she; "not I."</p>

<p>"No more don't me and Polly Mariar," says Miss
Stillman. Miss Savage went on: "I'd look purty,

<!-- page 308 -->

wouldent I, a workin' to fix up that meetin'-house for
Tuttle to preach in!" "So you don't like Mr. Tuttle,
hey?" says Miss Birsley. "Like him?" says she;
"not I. He don't know nothin'&mdash;can't preach no
more'n that stove-pipe"&mdash;(she hates Parson Tuttle
'cause he hain't never paid no more attention to her
than he has to the rest o' the congregation)&mdash;"he's
as green as grass and as flat as a pancake." "That's
jest what mar and me thinks," says Polly Mariar
Stillman. Miss Savage went on: "He don't know
B from a broomstick, nor bran when the bag's open."
"That's jest what I think," says Miss Stillman. "I
says to Mr. Stillman last Sabbath, as we was a comin'
from meetin', 'Mr. Stillman' says I"&mdash;But what 'twas
she said to Mr. Stillman, dear knows, for Miss Savage
dident let her go on. "I say," says she, "I'd look
beautiful a comin' to Sewin' Society and workin' the
eends o' my fingers off to build a pulpit for Tuttle to
be poked up in Sabbath after Sabbath, and preach off
jest what he's a mind tew. No&mdash;ye don't ketch me
a takin' a stich for such an object. I despise Tuttle,
and I'll tell him so tew his face when I git a chance.
Ye don't ketch me a slanderin' folks behind ther
backs and then soft-soapin' 'em to their faces, as some
folks dew"&mdash;(here she lookt at Miss Stillman and
Polly Mariar.) "And where's his wife, I'd like to
know? Why ain't <i>she</i> here to work to-day? A
purty piece o' bisness, I must say, for you all to be

<!-- page 309 -->

here a diggin' away to fix up Tuttle's meetin'-house,
when <i>she's</i> to hum a playin' <i>lady</i>." "Miss Tuttle
ain't very well," says I. "That's a likely story,"
says Miss Savage; and from that she went on and
blazed away about Miss Tuttle at a terrible rate. Miss
Stillman and Polly Mariar, and a number more o' the
wimmin, sot tew and helped her whenever they could
git a word in edgeways; and such a haulin' over as
Miss Tuttle and the parson got, I never heerd afore
in all the days o' my life.</p>

<p>While they was in the midst on't, Miss Gipson
come to the door and axed us to walk out to tea&mdash;she'd
ben out all the afternoon a gittin' it reddy&mdash;so
we put up our work and went out. We don't have
the tea handed round at our meetin's as a gineral
thing; we have the things sot on a long table; the
woman o' the house pours tea at one eend, and we all
stan' round and help ourselves. It's very convenient,
especially where they don't keep no help. Well, we
all took hold, and for a while Parson Tuttle and his
wife and every body else had a restin' spell, for even
Miss Samson Savage had other use for her tongue.
She believes in dewin' one thing to once. When <i>she</i>
eats she <i>eats</i>&mdash;and when she talks she talks.</p>

<p>And we had a real nice tea, I tell ye&mdash;biscuit and
butter, and crackers and cheese, and cold meat and
pickles, and custard and whipt cream, and three kinds
o' presarves, and four kinds o' cake, and what not!

<!-- page 310 -->

I couldent help o' thinkin' that the money laid out on
that tea would a went a good way toward the new
pulpit.</p>

<p>"What delightful biscuit," says Miss Grimes.
"They are so" says Miss Skinner; "but Miss Gipson
never has poor biscuit." "O shaw!" says Miss
Gipson, "you ain't in arnest: my biscuits is miserable&mdash;not
nigh so good as common. I don't think the
flour's first rate." "Miss Gipson, how <i>dew</i> you
make crackers?" says Miss Stillman; "I never tasted
none so good." "Now you don't mean so," says Miss
Gipson. "I <i>can</i> make good crackers, but them's very
poor; the oven wa'n't jest right when I put 'em in."
"I <i>must</i> have another piece o' this cheese, it's so good,"
says Miss Lippincott. "Where <i>did</i> you git it?"
"Well, I got it of old Daddy Sharp: he ginerally
makes excellent cheese; but I tell Mr. Gipson old
Sharp's failed for once&mdash;that's what I call poor cheese."
"Dew taste o' this plum sass Miss Peabody," says
Miss Brewster; "I never see the beat on't." "I'd
ruther have these peaches," says Miss Peabody;
"they're <i>derlicious</i>. It is a mystery to me how Miss
Gipson always has such luck with her presarves.
I never dew, and I always take pound for pound tew."
"This apple-jel's the clearest I ever see," says old Miss
Parker. "How did you make it, Miss Gipson? Dident
you dew it in the sun? I'm sure it don't look as
if it ever was nigh the fire." "Now don't speak o'

<!-- page 311 -->

that jel," says Miss Gipson. "I told Carline I was
ashamed o' my jel after seein' Miss Parker's, and I was
a'most sorry I'd made any presarves since I'd eat
some o' Miss Peabody's and Miss Skinner's, theirn was
<i>so</i> much nicer." So they went on. The whipt cream
and custard had to be gone over: Miss Gipson had to
tell jest how 'twas made&mdash;what flavorin' she used,
and all that&mdash;though she declared she was ashamed
on't. The <i>cake</i> was praised up: they must know
how much butter ther was in <i>this</i>, how many eggs it
took for <i>that</i>, and so forth; Miss Gipson, of course,
run it down&mdash;she <i>could</i> make good cake, but somehow
she failed that time. A person that dident know how
wimmin always go on at such a place, would a thought
that Miss Gipson had tried to have every thing the
miserablest she possibly could, and that the rest on
'em had never had anything to hum but what was
miserabler yet.</p>

<p>Well, every thing arthly comes to an eend, and so
did that tea after a spell, and purty' soon after we went
hum. Miss Stillman invited us to meet to their house
next time. She urged Miss Sampson Savage to come,
and I don't doubt but what she will if she thinks
ther's any chance for kickin' up a muss. I was in to
Miss Birsley's the next day, and she and I talked it
over. She says we hain't accomplished much yit, for
some o' the work's done so miserable 'twon't
never sell in creation without it's picked out and

<!-- page 312 -->

done over better. The rest is put together wrong,
and has got to be took to pieces whether or no. For
my part, I feel eny most discouraged about the Sewin'
Society.</p>

<h3>Aunt Maguire's Visit to Slabtown.</h3>

</div>

<p>I'VE ben a journey sence I saw you, Nancy, away
down to Slabtown, to see a cousin o' husband's
that lives there. She 'twas Eunice Ludlow, she married
a Bentley, carpenter and jiner by trade. They
moved from Coon's Holler to Slabtown about five
year ago, and there he follered the lumberin' business,
and done very well at it. I hadent seen 'em since,
they went away, and bein' as she urged me very hard,
and made me promise I'd come out there the last time
she was to our house, I thought I'd ought to go. I
used to set a great deal by Eunice when she was a gal.
I thought there never was a happier couple than she
and Bentley was when they lived at the Holler. He
had a good trade and was industrious, and so was she,
and they got along first rate. And then they had a
couple o' the nicest behaved children that I ever see.
Lucy, the eldest, was about eight year old when they
moved away, and Henry was five or six.</p>

<p>But I found things considerably altered since they
come to Slabtown. It's quite a big place, as big agin

<!-- page 314 -->

as Scrabble Hill, and growin' bigger all the time.
Eunice had got her idees raised a good deal, and had
some wonderful curus notions about <i>gintility</i>. The
house was furnished mighty grand, and she dident dew
her own work as she used to at the Holler, but kept
a great slatterin', imperdent hired gal, that done jest
as she was a mind tew about every thing.</p>

<p>Lucy, tew, she was a growin' up ginteel. She's
got to be the proudest little thing that ever I see,
peart and bold, and right up in every body's face and
eyes, stickin' in her gab all the time, and nippin' round
with a couple of awful long pigtails with bows on the
eends, a danglin' down her back.</p>

<p>Henry, he's about as hateful a young one as ever
went unflogged. I used to dread his comin' hum from
school; for he went yellin' and hollerin' round the
house, kickin' and spittin', and sassin' every body that
spoke to him. I actilly heerd him swear a number o'
times. And he's out in the streets late o' nights,
playin' and fightin' with all sorts o' boys. I talked to
his father about it, told him I thought he'd ought to
keep Henry in o' nights, and be more particklar about
his 'sociates. But he haw-haw'd right out in my face;
"Shaw, Aunt Magwire," says he, "that's all <i>cant</i>. I
believe in lettin' boys run; it's the only way to make
'em independent." "Sam Bentley," says I, "you
ain't the man you used to be. When you lived to
the Holler, you was quite partic'lar about yer children,

<!-- page 315 -->

and about yerself tew; for I remember you
used to go to meetin' quite stiddy with Eunice, and
always had prayers in yer family night and mornin'."
"Don't never mention that agin," says he; "I'm
ashamed on't. I was <i>green</i> in them days; now I've
got more inlarged views. The fact is, Aunt Magwire,
Slabtown's a <i>great</i> place. If I'd a stayed at Coon's
Holler, ten to one, I'd a went on in that snivellin',
cantin', go-to-meetin' way all my life." "Like
enough," says I; "and mabby got to heaven in it last.
Slabtown <i>is</i> a <i>great place</i>, and no mistake." Sam dident
say no more.</p>

<p>Eunice dident seem to be very proud o' me, I'm
such a plain, homemade body. She never introduced
me to none of her ginteel acquaintances when they
called; so, as I dident have nothing to say, I used to
have the benefit of all the conversation, and sartinly
'twas quite entertain'. They ginerally begun with
the fashions. Next, they took up the subject o' hired
gals, and when they'd wore that out, the neighborhood
in gineral had to undergo a haulin' over. 'Twas
pretty much the same as it is in Scrabble Hill, only I
think the Slabtown folks make ruther more fuss over
each other to their faces, than what they dew in our
place.</p>

<p>One afternoon, there was a youngish married woman
by the name o' Miss Teeters called. She and
Eunice are quite intimit; though, after all, Eunice

<!-- page 316 -->

don't seem to think much of her, but she considers
her wonderful ginteel. Her gintility seemed to consist
in her wearin' more colors than I ever see on to
once afore in all my born days. She had on a yaller
bunnit, with a great pink artificial on it; a red shawl,
and a green silk frock, and blue ribbin round her
neck, and I forget what all; but t' was enough' to
make a body's eyes ache to look at her.</p>

<p>After they'd gone over with the fashions, says Miss
Teeters, says she: "I see you keep Marthy yet; how
do you git along with her?"</p>

<p>But afore Eunice had time to answer her, the door
was banged open, and the very Miss Hawkins they'd
ben talkin' about come bowsin into the the room without
ever ringin' the bell. She was clear out o' breath;
for she's quite a fleshy woman. Her face was as red
as a blaze, and her green satin sack was all one-sided.
She looked as if she'd fixed in a wonderful hurry and
run all the way. "What's to pay?" says Miss Teeters
and Eunice in a breath. She couldent speak for
a minnit or so, she was so exhausted. I got up and
giv her the rockin'-cheer I was a sittin' in, and she
squoze herself into it, and says she&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Have</i> you heerd the news?"</p>

<p>"What news?" says Miss Teeters and Miss Bentley,
openin' their mouths and eyes and stretchin' their
necks. "What news?&mdash;dew tell, for pity's sake!"</p>

<p>"O dear me, suz," says she, "I never was so dumfoundered

<!-- page 317 -->

in all my life. Cousin Jeemes was in to
our house not half an hour ago, and read it to Sary
Ann and me. I thought I'd run in and see if Miss
Teeters had heerd on't. They said she was over to
Mr. Bentley's, so I come right on here."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it, in the name o' wonder?" says
Miss Teeters, says she.</p>

<p>"O dear me," says Miss Hawkins, a blowin' herself
with her handkercher as hard as ever she could. "O
dear me, ther's the awfulest piece that you ever see,
come out in the 'Ladies Book,' and it's all about our
Sewin' Society, takin' us off to an ioty, and tellin' all
how we go on; and, of course, 'twas writ in this village."</p>

<p>"You don't?" says Miss Teeters, says she.</p>

<p>"It's a fact," says Miss Hawkins. "And what's
worse yet, our minister's wife writ it."</p>

<p>"How you talk!" says Miss Teeters.</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldent wonder," says Eunice, says she,
"for I've heerd that your minister's wife writes for the
papers. But, pray, what does it say?"</p>

<p>"Oh," says Miss Hawkins, "as true as I'm a live
woman, it's got every one of our members in, and
shows us all up shamefully, only jest me and Sary
Ann. I can't see as ther's any body in it that resembles
us a mite. But you're drawed out, Miss
Teeters; and Cappen Sapley, he's down large as life;
and the Bomans are in for't; and so's Bill Sweezer's

<!-- page 318 -->

wife, and Samanthy Cooper, and Tom Baily's wife,
and Miss Ben Curtis; and there's a Miss Stillman and
her daughter, that's meant for the Longs. They're
all fictitious names, to be sure, but it's easy enough
to tell who's who. But the squire's wife ketches it
the worst of all. I tell ye, it takes her off to fits.
Nobody can mistake it. Jeemes wouldent let us keep
it, or I'd a fetcht it over. He war gwine to take it in
to the Bomanses. I hope you'll get hold on't; for
of all the abominable messes that ever I see, it's the
crownin' pint."</p>

<p>"Well, I never heerd the beat on't," says Miss Teeters.</p>

<p>"Nor I neither," says Eunice. "I should think a
minister's wife might be in better business. Well,
I'm glad I don't belong to your Society. I ain't took
off, that's sartin. But how do you know it actilly
means your Society?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's plain enough," says Miss Hawkins,
"for it tells things that was positively said and done
at some o' the meetin's. Jest how the squire's wife
went on; calls her 'Miss Samson Savage.' " (I begun
to prick up my ears. Thinks me, what on airth does
all this mean?)&mdash;"But the mystery to me is, how the
minister's wife got hold on't. She wa'n't there.
Somebody that <i>was</i> there must a told her. I wonder
who 'twas?"</p>

<p>Miss Teeters turned ruther red. I thought she

<!-- page 319 -->

looked kind o guilty; and says she: "It's abominable&mdash;it's
ridicilous! I'll go right home and tell my husband
how the minister's wife's ben writin' about me;
and I shouldent wonder if he should take the matter
up&mdash;he's cowhided a number of individdiwals for
speakin' disparagin' o' me. But has the squire's wife
heerd on't?"</p>

<p>"No," says Miss Hawkins. "I stopt there as I
come along, but she'd gone out o' town. Won't she
be mad, though; she's such a fiery critter!"</p>

<p>"I say," says Miss Teeters, says she, "it's high
time we got rid o' the minister; he ain't the man for
us. A ginteel and intellectible congregation like our'n
had ought to have a man o' great eloquential powers.
And as for his wife, I never could bear her, with her
old stripid dress that she wears every Sunday, rain or
shine. I don't believe she was ever accustomed to
ginteel society."</p>

<p>"Nor I neither," says Miss Hawkins. "I took a
dislike tew her when they first come here. I don't
like yer mum characters that never say nothin' about
nobody. It seems she's ben savin' on't up to let off
in the newspapers. Bethiar Nobles says she told her
she thought our congregation drest tew much; and I
shouldent wonder if she did, for she stuck to that old
straw bunnit and everlastin' stripid dress all winter,
and I s'pose it's to set an example o' plainness afore
us, jest as if we'd foller <i>her</i> lead. For my part, I think

<!-- page 320 -->

she might better spend more time a dressin', and less
a writin' for the newspapers. And they say he incourages
her in it, and likes to have her write. I wish
they was both furder off."</p>

<p>"I wish so tew," says Miss Teeters; "and I guess
ther's a good many that wish so. She ain't popilar at
all in our set. She never runs in sociably, as Miss
Van Duzen used to. They say she goes a great deal
more among the poor folks, than she does among the
ginteel part o' the congregation. And that's a sure
sign, <i>I think</i>, that she's ben more accustomed to minglin'
with them sort o' folks, than with such as we be."</p>

<p>Well, they blazed away in that style for as much as
an hour. I can't remember half they said; and Eunice
she told 'em that if she was they, she wouldent put up
with it; she'd make a fuss about it, and have the
minister sent off.</p>

<p>As soon as they'd gone, Eunice burst out a laughin',
and says she: "Well, if that ain't the best piece o'
news I've heerd this many a day. I've always heerd
that that Sewin' Society was a reg'lar slander-mill,
where the principal busines is to brew mischief against
the minister; and I'm glad they've got showed up at
last. The minister's a good man, and a smart man
tew; but the biggest part o' the congregation is such a
set of ignoramuses, that they don't know a smart man
from a fool. They always make a great fuss over
their minister when he first comes; but if he don't

<!-- page 321 -->

preach smooth things tew 'em all the time, they soon
contrive to starve him out or quarrel him off. When
they gin this one a call, they agreed to give him five
hundred dollars a year, and pay it quarterly. And it
is a solemn fact, that half on't hain't ben paid yet.
Betsy Hall, a girl that used to wash for 'em sometimes,
told me so. She said she'd often listened to
the door, and heerd the minister and his wife a talkin'
over their troubles; and she says that ther ain't more 'n
half a dozen in the congregation that pay their dues
reglarly; and if 'twa'n't for what the minister's wife
gits for writin' for the newspapers, they wouldent be
able to pay their house-rent and keep out o' debt, no
way. She said she overheerd him say to his wife one
day: 'The quarter's rent'll be due next Saturday, and
I hain't a cent to pay it.' 'Keep up your courage my
dear,' says she, 'perhaps I shall have somethin' from
Philadelphy before then.' And Betsy said she guessed
it come, for she was knowin' to the rent bein' paid
the next Saturday. I couldent help laughin' in my
sleeve when Miss Teeters was a tellin' how much better
Parson Van Duzen's wife was liked than this one.
They abused her like a pickpocket when she was here
and was always a runnin' her down. She couldent
dew nothin' to please 'em."</p>

<p>"Eunice," said I, "why dident you talk so when they
was in, and tell 'em plainly to their faces what you
thought."</p>

<!-- page 322 -->

<p>"O law," says she, "I dident want to get mixed up
in their quarrels." And then she throw'd on her
things and run off to some o' the neighbors to tell the
news and talk over it. She was gone till tea time.
But she dident have the satisfaction o' tellin' the story
first, for every body where she went had heerd it already.
News flies like wildfire in Slabtown. She
dident git hold o' the piece though; nobody hadent
seen it, but they'd all heerd about it. It's wonderful
how soon 'twas in every body's mouth. When Sam
comes hum he was full on't&mdash;said 'twas all over town&mdash;nothin'
else was talked about from one eend o' the
village to t'other. Eunice was very anxious to read
it; and Sam went to the bookstore to git it, but they'd
sold every copy they had, and ther was a great call
for more. Ther was a wonderful excitement about it.
Sam said the Californy fever was nothing tew it.
Californy and every thing else seemed to be entirely
forgot for a spell. The wimmin laid aside all other
business, and gadded round from house to house talkin
about the Sewin' Society. And the men, tew,
they're as fond o' tatlin' and gossipin' in Slabtown as
the wimmin. They met together in shops and stores,
and bar-rooms and oyster-cellars, and talked it over.
Wherever you'd see a mess o' men standin' you might
know they was discussin' the Sewin' Society.</p>

<p>In Slabtown, every body knows jest what every
body else says and does. It seemed raly wonderful to

<!-- page 323 -->

me how all that was said was trumpeted round. Private
conversations was blazed all over town, that must
a ben carried by the birds o' the air, or else ther must
a ben a good many ears occurpied at a good many
key-holes. I was wonderfully struck with this faculty
in the Slabtown folks. They're a community remarkable
for their <i>inquirin' minds</i>. If 'twas applied to
any useful purpose, ther's no calculatin' how much
they might accomplish. If the government should
ever conclude to make researches into the manners
and customs o' the antipodes under ground, I should
advise 'em to send to Slabtown for an explorin' company.
I'll warrant they'd find out all how and about
it for 'em. They'd report all that's a dewin' there,
and a good deal more. So 'twas about that article
that was laid to the ministers wife's door. Every body
know'd what every body else said and thought about
it. The <i>inquirin' minds</i> was all at work. Every
hour in the day ther was somebody a runnin' into
Bentley's with some new story&mdash;something the Hawkinses
or the Longs, or the Teeters, or the squire's
folks had said or done.</p>

<p>"And 'Miss Samson Savage,' " says Miss Teeters&mdash;"did
you ever see such a perfect picter as that is o'
the squire's wife?&mdash;how exactly it goes on like her,
don't it? Any body that ever see her would know it
in a minute."

<p>"But," says Teeters, "I don't see how the minister's

<!-- page 324 -->

wife found out how she talked. Some o' your members
must a peached."</p>

<p>Miss Teeters blushed, and says she: "Oh, dear me,
I'm dreadfully afeard she'll think 'twas me. If she
should, she'd hate me like pisen, and never invite me
to any more o' her parties. I wouldent git her ill-will
for all the world. What <i>shall</i> I dew? I must run
right over there 'fore any body else see her, and make
it all straight."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Teeters. "I wouldent be struck
out o' her good books for no money. We'll show
her that <i>we</i> don't uphold the minister's wife in such
conduct. But I must dew something tew. If she
was only a man I could give her a cowhidin' or at
least threaten to; but bein' she's a woman I don't
know what to dew."</p>

<p>"I'll tell ye, Teeters, what ye can dew," said his
wife. "You can circulate a petition to get the minister
dismissed."</p>

<p>"That's the checker," said Teeters, with a terrible
oath.</p>

<p>So Miss Teeters flung on her things and started off
for the squire's. And Teeters sot down to draw up
his petition. When she got to the squire's, Miss Teeters
huv herself down on the sofy and fainted away;
and the squire's wife run for the cologne bottle.
When she began to come tew, says the squire's wife,
says she&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 325 -->

<p>"For the land's sake, child, what's the matter with
ye?"</p>

<p>Miss Teeters groaned, and says she: "<i>Have</i> you
seen the Lady's Book?"</p>

<p>"What lady's book?" says the squire's wife, says
she.</p>

<p>"Why the Lady's Book that's printed in Philadephy
once a month."</p>

<p>"No, I hain't seen it," says shes. "What on't?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm so glad you hain't," says Miss Teeters;
"and I <i>do</i> hope you won't. Dont you look at it if you
do see it. I beg of you not to look at it for all the
world. Promise me you won't open it if you do see
it."</p>

<p>"Well, I should like to know," says the squire's
wife, "what's the reason I mustn't look at that partic'lar
book. For gracious sake, out with it!"</p>

<p>"Oh," says Miss Teeters, "ther's the awfullest piece
in it that ever you sot eyes on; and every body says
the minister's wife writ it. It's all about our Sewin'
Society&mdash;takes us off most shamefully&mdash;but you especially&mdash;shows
you up abominably&mdash;calls you 'Miss
Samson Savage.' It ain't a bit like you, to be sure;
but it's perfectly horrid. Do promise me not to read
it; for it'll hurt your feelins dreadfully. It did mine.
To think that a person I set so much by as I do
by you, should be so abused! Mr. Teeters is perfectly
outrageous about it; he says it isn't to be borne.

<!-- page 326 -->

He's intendin' to start a petition to have the minister
sent off. You know we've long ben tryin' to git rid
of him, and this'll be a good opportunity"&mdash;(Miss
Teeters had always pretended to the minister that she
was one of his best friends, and was always a runnin'
tew him with every thing the squire's wife and Miss
Hawkins said against him. Of course, he nor his
wife hadent no confidence in her. They understood
human nater well enough to know she'd talk against
<i>them</i> behind their backs.)</p>

<p>'Twas nat'ral enough, after all this parade, that the
squire's wife should be in a terrible pucker to see the
Lady's Book. So, after makin' a wonderful to do
about it, and pretendin' she was awful unwillin', Miss
Teeters fetcht her the book. At first, the squire's
wife declared that Miss Savage wa'n't meant for her,
but all her <i>particular friends</i> insisted upon it that 'twas.
So at last she had to give up, and, of course, she was
awful mad about it, and stormed away at a terrible
rate.</p>

<p>Miss Hawkins, she kept the ball a rollin'; devoted
her hull time to runnin' round the neighborhood and
blazin' away about it. She was what folks call "toady"
to the squire's wife, and every body said that the
"Miss Stillman" in the piece, that was makin' such a
muss, meant her, and she tho't so tew. But she tho't
that if she could make folks believe 'twas intended
for Miss Long, she could accomplish tew ends: she'd

<!-- page 327 -->

git rid o' havin' the names o' Miss Stillman and Polly
Mariar tucked onto her and her daughter, and, what was
purty important, turn the Longs against the minister
and his wife. Now the Longs was very stiddy, go-to-meetin'
sort o' folks, and had always been very friendly
to the minister's family. So Miss Hawkins went
puffin' and blowin, round town, makin' a terrible fuss
about the "piece," and dwellin' partic'larly on the awful
shame it was to take off the Longs so. One day she went
into the squire's, and the squire's wife says to her,
says she: "Well, how do you feel about bein' hit off
by Aunt Magwire? You ketch it about as bad as I
dew."</p>

<p>"O, shaw," says Miss Hawkins, "I ain't hit off at all.
What makes you think I be?"</p>

<p>"Now, Hawky," says the squire's wife, "it's all nonsense
for you to try to make me think that ain't meant
for you and Sary Ann. I <i>know</i> 'tis."</p>

<p>"Well," says Miss Hawkins, says she, "between
you and me, the fact is, whether 'twas meant for me
or not, one thing's clear, if we could make the Longs
believe 'twas intended for them, we should be pretty
sure o' gittin' rid o' the minister. For, of course, Miss
Long and Helen would feel dretfully hurt about
bein' took off so by the minister's wife, and Mr. Long
he'd think jest as they did. And if we can once git
the Longs set against the minister's folks, they'll have
to quit in short order."</p>

<!-- page 328 -->

<p>"Well, that is an idee," says the squire's wife.
"Hawky, you's more cunnin' than I be. If 'Daddy-long-legs' "&mdash;(that's
what she calls Mr. Long behind
his back)&mdash;"once gits his dander up it'll be all day
with the parson; for some how or other, he's contrived
to git considerable influence in the parish. It must
be because he's such a stiddy old poke, for he hain't
no more mind of his own than that pair o' tongs. I
can turn him round with my little finger. I guess I'll
go down and give 'em astirrin' up." So up she started
and off she traipsed to Mr. Long's. She marched
into the parlor, where Miss Long and Helen was a sittin',
and makin' a low curchy, she says, says she:
"Miss Samson Savage, at your sarvice; and how does
Miss Stillman and Polly Mariar dew to-day?"</p>

<p>Well, to make a <i>long</i> story short, the Longs was
made to believe that the minister's wife had actilly
ben showin' 'em up. Of course they was outrageous
about it; and Miss Long talked harder aginst the minister's
wife than she'd ever talked aginst any body
afore. She dident go <i>tew</i> her, like a Christian ought
to, and ax an explanation, but she contented herself
with callin' her an <i>abominable woman</i> and a <i>shameful
critter</i>, and said she wa'n't fit to be a minister's wife,
and so forth. And Mr. Long he jined in with the opposition,
and wanted the minister to quit.</p>

<p>And Teeters, he got up his petition, and went blusterin'
round with it, threatenin' to cowhide everybody

<!-- page 329 -->

that dident sign it. He hadent got but a few names
to it, when he went into Sharp's store and axed Sharp
to sign it. Sharp's a straight-forrard feller, that minds
his own business. He took the petition and lookt at
it, and then deliberately opened the stove door and
throw'd it in; and turnin' to Teeters, says he: "Teeters,
you're a fool; go hum and take care o' yer wife,
and let alone meddlin' with what's none o' yer business."</p>

<p>I s'pose you think Teeters cowhided him on the
spot; but you're mistaken. He went hum and took
it out in rippin' and swearin', and threatenin' to take
the law o' Sharp.</p>

<h3>Visit to Slabtown, Continued.</h3>

</div>

<p>LAW me, Nancy, why 'twould take a week to tell
all the sayin's and dewin's that took place in
Slabtown in consequence o' that article in the Lady's
Book. I never see nor heerd o' nothin' equal to't.
Such a tempest in a tea-pot! such an awful uproar
about nothin'! 'Twas wonderful&mdash;'twas amusin' tew.
And what was the poor minister's wife about all this
time? Why she was to hum, a mindin' her own
business as usual. Miss Teeters was heerd to say to
several individdiwals, that she guessed that old stripid
dress and straw bunnit wouldent darst to show themselves
in church no more, when there was such an
excitement. But Sunday came and there was the
minister's wife in her seat, lookin' jest as if nothin'
had happened more'n or'nary. The members o' the
Sewin' Society thought 'twas very audacious in
her.</p>

<p>'Twas cur'us to see how all the persons that was
the most active in makin' a noise and keepin up the
excitement, had every one on 'em some eend o' their

<!-- page 331 -->

own that they hoped to forrard by makin' a hue and
cry. There was the Slaters, they were dretful mad at
the squire's wife, because she hadent invited 'em to
her last party. And Mr. Sweezer had told 'em that
the squire's wife remarked at her party, that she
dident invite the Slaters because she meant to be more
select in her parties in futur'. Sweezer's very intimit
with the squire's folks&mdash;a kind o' boot-licker tew 'em&mdash;though
he's always slanderin' 'em to their backs.
He's a reg'lar man-gossip. Well, the Slaters was
wonderful tickled to see the squire's wife git such a
<i>dressin' out</i>, as they called it; so they went round exultin'
over it.</p>

<p>Then ther was a number that was wonderful anxious
to git themselves into notice, no matter how. And
they blazed away about the <i>impropriety o' writin' such
articles</i>. They disproved on 'em entirely. But them
that was tryin' to git into the squire's wife's good
graces, was the most obstropelous about it. They
called it abominable&mdash;awful! they hoped the squire
would take the law o' the minister's wife, and so forth.
And some that was rejoiced to git hold o' any thing
that could be turned against the minister, went sneakin'
round takin' it up in a sly way; they was very
sorry it had happened, very; but it was all up with
the minister now; he might as well pack up his traps
and budge at once; for he couldent be supported in
Slabtown no longer, public sentiment was so against

<!-- page 332 -->

him. Then, tew, ther was a careful set, such as there
is every where, that wanted to be "right side up;"
and not bein' able to determine for sartin which would
turn out to be the popilar party, all they done, when
the "Sewin' Society" was mentioned, was to shake
their heads and look knowin'. But the tew-sided
party was the most numerous. They circulated round
from the minister's friends to his enemies, and pretended
to belong to jest the side they happened to be with.
To the minister's friends they said, "that was a first-rate
article in the Lady's Book; 'twas capital&mdash;'twas
true to nater&mdash;it took off them that deserved it richly;
and they hoped that the author'd write more, and give
'em another dig." When they got among the opposite
party, they said " 'twas a slanderous, thing&mdash;'twas
shameful&mdash;'twa'n't to be put up with;" and
then they carried back and forth all they heerd on
both sides, and made a sight o' mischief. Mr. Sweezer
was one o' this kind. He had about as much as he
could attend to for a spell, runnin' from one side
t'other carryin' the news.</p>

<p>But the most active o' the two-siders was Bethiar
Nobles, an old gal that gits her livin' principally by
visitin'. She's acquainted with every thing that goes
on in the village; knows every body's business, jest
what young folks are ingaged, and who's broke off
their ingagements; who's ben disappointed, and
who's distracted after who. She knows jest what

<!-- page 333 -->

couples lives like cats and dogs together, what
ones is livin' beyond their means, and who's over
head and ears in debt, and how every lady in town
carries on her kitchenary consarns, how scrimpin' they
live, and all that. She always has some great excitin'
piece o' scandal on her hands that sarves for visitin'
capital; and when one wears out she trumps up
another. She's an awful disagreeable old critter, but
still ther's plenty o' folks that's willin' to incourage
her, for the sake o' hearin' her talk. Well, when the
Sewin' Society muss come up, she was on her high
heels. It gin her plenty o' business for a spell. She
visited on the strength on't for a month at least. As
sure as the day come round, off started Bethiar Nobles
on her scandal-peddlin' expedition. Wherever she
went, the first question she axed was: "Have you
seen <i>that article</i> in the Lady's Book?" and the next:
"What do you think on't?" and what ever <i>they</i>
thought <i>she</i> thought tew, and jawed away accordin'ly,
and <i>spent the day</i> a tellin' what she heerd on both
sides.</p>

<p>One day she went to the minister's and spent the
afternoon. After she'd hauled out her knittin' work,
and spread her white handkerchief across her lap for
show (she's an awful snuff-taker, and carries an old
red silk one in her pocket for use)&mdash;after she'd hauled
out her knittin' work, says she "Have you seen that
piece that's come out in the Lady's Book?"</p>

<!-- page 334 -->

<p>"I've seen a number of pieces in the Lady's
Book," says the minister's wife, "which one do you
refer to?"</p>

<p>"Why, that one about the Sewin' Society that
appeared in the Jinuwary number," says Bethiar, says
she.</p>

<p>"I havent read that number at all," says the
minister's wife. "Mine was borrowed before I'd had
time to open it."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>I've</i> seen it," says Bethiar; "and I think
it's complete. I hope the person that writ <i>that</i>'ll keep
on writin', and give it to 'em again. I never see
nothin' to beat that description of the squire's wife&mdash;it's
her to a T. They say she <i>feels</i> it tew. I'm glad
she does; and I hope it'll make her draw in her horns
and remember her origin, and behave a little more
decent. And Miss Teeters, I was glad to see her
ketch it&mdash;ridicilous critter, neglectin' her children
and flirtin' round with the young men all the time.
And the Longs; that's the best o' the hull; I tell ye,
it done me good to see <i>them</i> cut up. I hope it'll larn
'em to think for themselves, and not pin their faith to
big folkses coat-tails. They never have no opinion o'
their own. I dew despise them Longs." The minister's
wife interrupted her, and says she&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dident you spend the day at Mr. Long's yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Yes," says Berthiar, says she.</p>

<!-- page 335 -->

<p>"Seems to me it's strange you should visit people
you despise so," says the minister's wife.</p>

<p>Bethiar was rather nonplushed for a minute, and
dident seem to know what to say. She hauled out
her snuff-box and took a monstrous pinch, and draw'd
round her nose one side and snuffed it up, and then
draw'd it round t'other side and snuffed it up agin;
and when she'd fixed out what to say, she begun:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, I did spend the day there, and it's the last
day I'll spend there for <i>one</i> while, I guess; for they
had so much to say aginst you and yer husband that I
was perfectly disgusted. They're awful mad about that
piece, and say you writ it. I told 'em, whether you
did or not, <i>I</i> thought 'twas a first-rate thing." So
she run on, tellin' ever so much stuff that the Longs
had said against the minister and his wife, and all
how she tried to stop 'em, and felt so distresst to hear
'em. The minister's wife kept on sewin', and dident
make no farther remark. Bethiar stayed all the afternoon
and evenin', and talked and snuffed, and bored
'em through and through; and then went off declarin'
she'd had a delightful visit.</p>

<p>The next day she went to the squire's&mdash;Miss Teeters
and Miss Hawkins was there, They was all glad to
see Bethiar come in, for they know'd she'd bring the
news. She told 'em she'd ben to the minister's; and
they was wonderful cur'us to know how the minister's
wife felt, and all she said and done. "Was she a

<!-- page 336 -->

writin'?" says Miss Teeters. "No," says Bethiar;
"not when I went in; she'd jest tucked it away when
she heerd the bell ring. I know'd by the looks o'
things that she'd ben a writin'. She don't keep no
help now; and I stayed to tea a purpose to see what
sort o' work she made gittin' vittals. When she went
out to git tea I offered to go and help her; for I did
want to take a peep into the butt'ry and see what condition
'twas in&mdash;they say these writin' wimmin is
such sluttish critters about their houses. But she was
tew cunnin' to let me see behind the curtin'. She said
she dident need no assistance."</p>

<p>"Why dident you insist upon't and go ahead,
whether or no?" says the squire's wife. "That's the
way I'd a done."</p>

<p>"Oh," says Bethiar, "she's so kind o' stiff, I
darsent; but I took a good look round when I went
into the bed-room to take off my things. I wish to
gracious you could see the quilt that's on her bed!
It's the greatest curiosity in the quiltin' line that ever
I sot eyes on&mdash;old fashioned herrin' bone, the lines
as much as tew inches apart&mdash;without stretchin', full
tew inches apart!"</p>

<p>It's cur'us, by the way, what a wonderful time the
Slabtown wimmin make about their quilts. Ther
seems to be a continniwal strife there as to who shall
git the most stitchin' on a quilt. They crowd and
stuff 'em as full o' work as they possibly can. Folks

<!-- page 337 -->

that's able to buy han'some bed-kivers, never think
o' such a thing. But they'll spend ever so many
weeks a diggin' away at a home-made bed-quilt, and
git the neighbors together time and agin, and stitch,
stitch, stitch, stitch, as if their lives depended on't,
and not feel satisfied till every spot as big as a sixpence
is kivered with stitches. Eunice had a quiltin'
while I was there. My eyes wa'n't good enough to
work on the quilt, and Eunice dident seem to be very
sorry; for she wa'n't very anxious to have me make
my appearance among her genteel friends. So I
staid up in my own room. Ther was a stove-pipe
hole in the floor from the parlor where they was
quiltin', and I could hear 'em talk. Grammany, what
a buzzin' they kept up! I tell ye, every body that
wa'n't there had to take it, and no mistake. It would
have to be a pretty skillful arithmeticker that could
calculate how many characters can be pulled to pieces
while one quilt's a puttin' together. But I was tellin'
about Bethiar Noble's account o' her visit to the
parson's. She went on to tell, and says she&mdash;</p>

<p>"And of all the teas that ever I sot down tew, if
that wa'n't the beat!" (she praised up every thing sky
high while she was eatin' on't). "Baker's bread as
dry as a stick. I s'pose she's tew lazy to make her
own bread, or else she has so much writin' to dew she
can't spend time; and the cake&mdash;dear knows how

<!-- page 338 -->

long it had ben baked&mdash;and plum-sass as sour as
vengeance."</p>

<p>"But what did she say?" says the squire's wife.
"That's the main pint. What did she have to say
about the <i>piece?</i>"</p>

<p>"She kept pretty mum about <i>that</i>, I tell ye," says
Bethiar; "for, you see, I pretended I dident know
she writ it, so I went on and told <i>my</i> opinion pretty
freely. I said that I guessed if the writer on't thought
they was a gwine to injure people of such standin' as
the squire's wife and Miss Teeters, they'd find themselves
mistaken. She look't awful mad, but never
opened her head. Then I spoke o' the Longs, what
fine people they was, and said I spent the day before
with 'em. When I said that, she spoke up, and
says she: 'Well, <i>I</i> wouldent visit such despisable
people.' "</p>

<p>"She talked against the Longs, hey?" says the
squire's wife. "Well, they ought to know it."</p>

<p>"They <i>shall</i> know it," says Miss Teeters.</p>

<p>"I thought I should tell 'em on't," says Bethiar.</p>

<p>"Well, they must know it to-day, for to-morrow's
Sunday," says Miss Hawkins. "I s'pose you calculate
to spend the afternoon here, so I guess I'll jest run
down myself and give 'em a hint on't."</p>

<p>Well, I kept a hearin' more and more every day,
and what to make on't, I dident know. 'Twas all
"Miss Samson Savage, and Miss Stillman, and Miss

<!-- page 339 -->

Fustick and Miss Birsley." Thinks me, how on arth
has all this about our Sewin' Society got out? and
what makes the Slabtown folks think it means them?
I was wonderful puzzled, but thought 'twa'n't best to
say any thing about it. At last, one day, Sam got
hold of a Lady's Book, and fetcht it hum; and Eunice
took it and sot down to read the wonderful piece out
loud. She turned along till she come to't, and says
she: "Here 'tis&mdash;'Aunt Magwire's Account of the
Sewin' Society at Scrabble Hill.' " I tell <i>you</i>, I
jumped as if I was shot: "Grammany," says I, "that
means me!" Then it begun to crawl through my
hair that the name o' the book was "Godey's Lady's
Book," and says I: "I'll bet a dollar it's the same
Mr. Godey that I know, and he's went and printed
off that story that I told him about our Sewin' Society."
After I got calmed down a little, Eunice went
on and read it; and, sure enough, there 'twas, word
for word, jest as I told it to Mr. Godey. I told 'em
so.</p>

<p>"Now, Sam," says I, "you go right off down street,
and tell every body that that are's a ginniwine description
of our Scrabble Hill Sewin' Society, and
nothin' else."</p>

<p>"I shan't dew it," says Sam. "They wouldent believe
a word on't if I should; and, besides, I like to
see the fun go on."</p>

<p>"I say so tew," says Eunice. "If they're a mind

<!-- page 340 -->

to take it tew themselves, let 'em; they deserve a
usin' up, and I'd be the last one to tell 'em they hadent
got it."</p>

<p>Well; what to dew, I dident know; I was a
stranger there, and couldent go round tellin' how 'twas
myself. But it did hurt my feelins amazin'ly, to
think that the minister's wife was a sufferin' for't, and
that his enemies was a makin' a handle on't to injure
him and drive him away. I pondered on't, and pondered
on't; and, at last, I made up my mind that the
least I could dew would be go to the minister's and
explain it tew 'em. So I told Sam and Eunice what
I meant to dew. But they tried to persuade me not
to. Eunice said 'twas all nonsense; she wa'n't acquainted
with the minister's wife, but she looked like
a very stiff, haughty woman, and she'd treat me cool,
and I'd have my labor for my pains. But I determined
to set my own conscience at rest, so I put on
my things and started off. Eunice tried with all her
might to stop me, but my mind was made up. Sam
wouldent go with me, nor tell me where they lived,
so I had to inquire the way as I went. 'Twas a
moonlight night, and I dident have no trouble in
findin' the house; but 'twas onpleasant to be out
alone in a strange place. When I got to the doorsteps
my courage failed, and I was afeard to ring the
bell; I dident know but what ther was company in,
and dident want to go in if ther was. I noticed

<!-- page 341 -->

little crack one side o' the winder shades, so I stepped
up softly and peeped in. Ther wa'n't nobody there
but the minister's wife; she sot by the table a darnin'
stockins, and ther was a big basketful o' duds beside
her, that she was a gwine to mend. She looked like
a good natered woman. I stood and watched her
for some time. As I was a lookin' at her, I noticed a
smile come over her face. Thinks me, I'll bet a dollar
she's a thinkin' about the "Sewin' Society." A
minute after, the smile went off and she looked
troubled and oneasy; thinks me, she's a wonderin'
what'll turn up, next. It made me think of poor Miss
Scrantum, and her troubles. After a spell I plucked
up courage and pulled the bell. She come to the
door and axed me in; but after I'd got seated, I dident
know how to begin nor what to say. The minister's
wife see that I felt aukard, so she made some remark
about the weather, and so on; then she axed
me to take off my things; I thanked her, and said I
couldent stay long. At last I ham'd and haw'd, and
stammered out: "I hope you'll pardon a stranger for
intrudin' on you?" "No intrusion at all," says she;
"every body's welcome to the minister's house." So
then, I felt relieved, and says I: "I come from Scrabble
Hill to visit a relation o' mine that lives here; and
I've happened to come just in the midst o' the muss
they've kicked up about that piece they're a layin'
to you. I know all the folks that it tells about."

<!-- page 342 -->

<p>"You do?" says she. "And do you know Aunt
Magwire?"</p>

<p>I riz up, and makin' as good a curchy as I know'd
how, says I: "I'm that individdiwal, at yer service."</p>

<p>"Indeed," says she, comin' up to me and shakin'
hands with me; "well, I'm very glad to see you
though you <i>have</i> got me into a muss."</p>

<p>"O dear me," says I, "I hope you don't think I
know'd that story was a gwine to travel to Slabtown,
when I told it to Mr. Godey?"</p>

<p>"Law, no," says she; "don't give yourself the least
trouble about it; you ain't a bit to blame."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad you feel so," says I; "but ain't it
curus that the Slabtown folks should take it all to
themselves as they dew?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," says she; "human natur's the same
every where."</p>

<p>"I guess so," says I. "Any how, your Sewin'
Society must be wonderfully like our'n, or they
wouldent be so detarmined it means them; but what
hurts my feelin's is, that you should have to suffer
for't. I was so distrest when I heerd they was a layin'
on't to you, and usin' on't to injure yer husband,
that I felt as if I must come right over and see you,
though you was a stranger. If any body's to blame,
I'm willin' to bear it."</p>

<p>"O fie," says she, "don't you fret yourself a bit
about it. If people choose to fit your coats to their

<!-- page 343 -->

own backs, 'tain't your fault; and if they fit nice and
snug, perhaps they'll do as good service as if they
were made expressly for 'em."</p>

<p>"Jest so," says I. "But it does seem tew bad that
you should suffer for't. Ain't ther no way o' puttin'
a stop tew it?"</p>

<p>"Never you mind," says she; "we minister's folks
must have our trials, of one sort or another, wherever
we go. If we hadent this perhaps we should
have somethin' still worse."</p>

<p>"But," says I, "what if they should drive you away
from here?"</p>

<p>She smiled, and dident say nothin'.</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "to judge from what I've seen o'
Slabtown since I come here, I'm bold to say that, if
they do drive you away, they can't possibly drive you
to a worse place."</p>

<p>"Hush, Aunt Magwire," says she, "human natur's
the same every where; we must expect trouble
wherever we go. I feel prepared for almost any
thing."</p>

<p>"Yes," says I, "I s'pose you feel a good deal as
that fox in the story did, when them miserable insects
was a bitin' him. 'Let 'em alone,' says he; 'for if
you drive 'em away ther'll come a hungrier swarm.' "</p>

<p>Well, that was the amount of our conversation.
The minister's wife was very polite to me, and I invited
her to call on me if ever she come through

<!-- page 344 -->

Scrabble Hill. She said she would, and hoped we
should git better acquainted.</p>

<p>I come away a few days after that, and I ruther
guess it'll be a good while afore I go a visitin' to
Slabtown agin'. The place is tew awful <i>ginteel</i> to suit
my taste.</p>

<h3>XXVIII.</h3>

<h3>Mrs. Maguire's Account of Deacon Whipple.</h3>

</div>

<p>HE'S a mortal teaze, husband is. He does like a
joke about as well as any man I ever see. But
he's always good-natured, hain't no malice at heart in
his capers. He was a leetle wicked though about that
are cider hoax he played off on Deacon Whipple and
Deacon Bedott. See&mdash;did you ever hear about that?
Well, I'll tell you, for I think 'twas one o' the cutest
tricks he ever come. But in the first place you must
know what sort o' a man Deacon Whipple was, or
else you won't sense the joke. Well, accordin' to my
notion, he was about as contemptible a specimen of a
man as ever walked shoe-leather. I always thought
so, and so did husband, though ther was a good many
folks in Wiggletown looked upon him as clear perfection,
'cause he had so much sanctimony. He come
from Meddleville to our town, and he was so wonderful
pious, and made such an awful parade of his religion,
prayin' and exortin' and laborin' for souls, as he
called it, that when he'd ben there about three months,
they made him deacon. As soon as he was promoted,

<!-- page 346 -->

he begun meddlin' in every body's bizness the worst
way, watchin' all the naborhood, and takin' on 'em to
dew for every little thing that dident happen to come
up to his idees o' duty. This he called "consarn
for the welfare o' Zion." As sure as ther was a
party o' young folks, there was Deacon Whipple's long
nose poked into some o' the winders to pry out what
was done. And if ther was any church members
among 'em, and they happened to play "Button&mdash;button!
whose got the button?" or danse round a little,
he'd have 'em hauled up before the session to anser
for't. It seemed to dew him a deal o' good to ketch
any o' the brethren or sisters a trippin'. A body'd a
thought he spent the heft of his time a pryin' into
other folks' bizness, but some how or other he managed
to take care of his own tew; he was a tailor by
trade, and a reg'lar old cabbagin' skinflint to boot.
That reminds me o' what Jo Snyder said to him once.
You see he was an awful stingy critter, and so was
Miss Whipple. The 'printices used to complain dretfully
o' ther livin'&mdash;said they was nigh about starved.
Well, Jo Snyder he stuck his head into the shop winder
one day and says he (Jo was an independent critter),
says he, "Deacon, how comes it you starve yer
'printices so, when you're always so flush o' cabbage?"
The deacon was awful mad. Says he to Jo, "If you
was a <i>professor</i> you'd ketch it." He was a monstrous
mean-<i>lookin</i>' man tew. You'd a know'd to see him in

<!-- page 347 -->

the street that he was' a contracted critter&mdash;had a stingy
kind of a walk&mdash;went along as if he begrudged
the room he took up. The circumstance I was a
gwine to tell took place when he'd ben deacon only
a little risin' tew year&mdash;and it's a sollem fact, ther'd
ben more cases o' deseplyne in that short time than
ther ever was afore sense the place was settled. Now
Deacon Bedott wa'n't such a man at all. He was
great on prayin' and exortin', but he dident meddle in
his nabors' consarns, nor think himself so much piouser
and better 'n all the rest o' creation. Well, the next
fall arter we come away from Wiggletown, husband
and me went out there a visitin'. You see Mother
Poole and Mother Magwire both lived there, and Sister
Bedott tew, and I spent the time visitin' round
from one to t'other. Well, one evenin' I was to Sister
Bedott's&mdash;husband had gone over to Mother Magwire's.
'Twas about a year afore Deacon Bedott
died, and he wa'n't very well&mdash;you know he was feeble
a number o' years afore his death. Well, he and
Sister Silly and me was a settin' round the settin'-room
fire, and Artemishy Pike&mdash;the Widder Pike's oldest
darter&mdash;she was a spendin' the evenin' there. Artemishy
was jest a tellin' us about Deacon Whipple's
comin' to thair house the day afore to take Cinthy
(her youngest sister) to dew, 'cause he'd heerd how't
she 'tended a ball when she was over to Varmount a
visitin'; and Artemishy was in an awful fidgit about

<!-- page 348 -->

it, for fear he'd have her hauled up for't, and she
wanted Deacon Bedott to try to prevent it. Well, she
was just a tellin' about it when ther come a knock to
the door. "Walk in," says Sister Bedott&mdash;and who
should walk in but Deacon Whipple, with Deacon
Kenipe and Deacon Crosby on behind him! "There,"
says I to Artemishy, "the <i>Old One</i>'s always at hand
when you're talkin' about him." "Hush!" says she.
"Lawful sakes!" says I; "I ain't afeard o' bein' hauled
up&mdash;I don't live here." When they come in, Artemishy
looked half-skairt to death. She thought
they'd come to talk about dealin' with Cinthy, but Sister
Bedott whispered tew her, and says she, "Don't
be afeard; I don't bleve it's Cinthy. I guess more
likely it's Sue Collins." ('Twas the same time they
had <i>her</i> over the coals.) Whatever 'twas, we all
know'd 'twas purty important bizness, for Deacon
Whipple lookt wonderful <i>big</i> and awful sollem: his
face was about half a yard long. But though he tried
to appear as if he felt dretful bad, 'twas plain to be
seen he was enjoyin' a state of intarnal satisfaction&mdash;lookt
jest as he always did when he got hold of a case
that suited him to a T. But Deacon Kenipe and Deacon
Crosby lookt as if they <i>raly</i> felt bad. (They was
very clever men indeed.) <i>They</i> dident say a word, but
Deacon Whipple he convarsed a spell about matters
and things in gineral, said the weather was oncommon
fine for the season o' year, crops were wonderful

<!-- page 349 -->

abundant, 'specially the apple crop&mdash;though 'twas to
be lamented that any o' the good critters o' Providence
should be abused and turned to the ruination o' mankind
as apples was by bein' made into cider. Then
he went on to deplore the low state o' religion in the
place, axed us wimmin folks about the state of our
minds and so on, and then said they'd come on private
bizness and would like to see Deacon Bedott
alone a spell. So we three wimmin got up and went
into the kitchen. "Now," says Sister Bedott, says
she, "I feel as if I'd like to know what they've come
for&mdash;wouldent you?" "Yes," says we. "Well,
then, "says Silly, "let's go into the buttry and listen."
"Agreed," says we. So in we went. You see ther
was a passage between the settin'-room and the kitchen,
and on one side o' this passage the buttry was sittiwated;
and ther was a door leadin' from the buttry
into the settin'-room, and atop o' this door ther was an
awful wide crack, so't a body could hear every word
that was said in the settin'-room there. Well, in we
goes, as still as mice. Artemishy and me we got up
on an old box and peeped through the crack, and Sister
Bedott she put her ear to the keyhole. Deacon
Whipple had begun to talk afore we got fixed. The
first thing I heerd him say, says he, "It's very onpleasant
bizness, very indeed. I assure you it's very
tryin' to my feelins to be necessiated to rebuke a brother,
but it seems to be an insurmountable duty in

<!-- page 350 -->

this case. We're all poor errin' critters; the best on,
us is liable to go astray and fail in our duty. I'm free
to confess that <i>even I</i> have my shortcomins"&mdash;I guess
he had an attack on't when he cut husband's pantaloons;
they was so short and so tight he had to give
'em to Jeff&mdash;"I have my shortcomins, and I feel to
mourn for't; I feel to lament that I'm fraquently
cold and slack in dewin' my duty&mdash;don't keep such a
constant watch round the walls o' Zion as I'd ought
tew. I feel as if it may be owin' to my onfaithfulness
Brother Bedott, that you've fell into the practice o'
such a hyneous offence&mdash;ahem&mdash;&mdash;" "Gosh!" says
Deacon Bedott, says he&mdash;(now Deacon Bedott never
used bad language in his life, but once in a while when
he was dretfully took by surprise he used to say
"<i>gosh!</i>")&mdash;"Gosh," says he, "I want to know if you
was a meanin' me all this time? Well, I'd like to
know what I've ben a dewin'?" "O dear," says Silly,
says she, "it's husband, it's husband! What <i>has</i>
he done&mdash;what has he <i>done</i>?" "Don't make a foss,"
says I; "they'll hear you, and we shall have to clear
out." Deacon Bedott went on; "I ain't aware o' bein'
in the practice of any known sin. If I've done
wrong in any way I'm willin' to be told on't, and I hope
I shall take your rebuke as I'd ought tew&mdash;though as
I said afore I ain't aware o' bein' in the practice of
any hyneous offense, as you call it." Says Deacon
Whipple, says he, with a rael provokin' grin, "I'm

<!-- page 351 -->

raly sorry you're so dull of apprehension, Brother Bedott.
It's truly lamentyble, when a brother, that's ben
apparently a burnin' and shinin' light, turns out to be
such agreevibus transgresser&mdash;when sinners round is in
such perishin' need o' havin' good examples sot afore
'em, to make 'em cast down the weapons o' rebellion.
And it's still woss, when such a backslidin' brother is
reasoned with, to see him refuse to confess his faults,
and repent of his sins and mend his ways." "Dew
tell me," says Deacon Bedott, says he, "what the sin
<i>is</i>, and if I've raly been guilty on't, I'll repent, and
confess, and forsake it tew." "I'm sorry to see you
so obderret," says Deacon Whipple, says he. "You
know, Scripter says, if a brother is overtook in a fault,
the brother must go tew him and tell him on't&mdash;and
if he refuses to hear 'em, why, he must be dealt with
afore the congregation; and I'm afeard that's what
<i>you'll</i> have to come tew, Brother Bedott, if you hold
out so." "O misery me!" says Silly, says she, "What
has that man ben a <i>dewin!</i> what <i>has</i> he ben a dewin!
O dear me! what an onfortunit woman I be!" "Silly,"
says I, "why can't you shet yer head? Take
my word for't, he hain't done nothin'&mdash;it'll turn out,
to be jest nothin' at all, I'll bet a goose, so dew be
easy." Well, arter Deacon Whipple had gone on so
for ever so long. Deacon Bedott got clear out o'
patience, and says he, "For massy's sake, what <i>is</i> it?
Brother Kenipe, Brother Crosby, dew tell me what

<!-- page 352 -->

'tis." "I'd rather not," says Deacon Kenipe, says he,
"Brother Whipple begun, and he ought to finish."
"I say so tew," says Deacon Crosby. "Why," says
Deacon Whipple, "it's curus that Brother Bedott
should be so onwillin' to own up, without my comin'
right out." "O! dear me, suz!" says Sister Bedott,
"that he should be a cuttin' capers, and me never suspect
him on't! O Melissy, I shall <i>die!</i> I <i>shall</i> die!"
and she begun wringin' her hands like mad. "You
simple critter," says I, "dew save yer highsteerics till
there's occasion for 'em; dew keep still, they'll hear
you, sartin sure, and if they should ketch us a listenin',
'twould ruin all our three repertations." On account
o' Silly's interruption, we lost what Deacon Whipple
said next&mdash;and the first thing, we heerd arter she got
quiet agin, was Deacon Bedott sayin' "It's curus you
should be so willin' to believe such a story about me,
when you've know'd me some years, and hain't never
heerd nothin' o' the kind till now." "I for one wa'n't
willin' to believe it," says Deacon Kenipe; "nor I
nother," says Deacon Crosby, says he. "Now, ther
ain't no use in denyin' on't, Brother Bedott," says
Deacon Whipple, says he&mdash;"A few years ago, 'twa'n't
thought to be no great crime, to take a glass o' sperrits
now and then; ther wa'n't so much light on the subject
as ther is now in these ere temperance days; but,
even then, 'twas eny most an onheerd-of thing for
any body, to git intosticated on cider&mdash;as you're in a

<!-- page 353 -->

habit o' dewin' now against light and privelidge&mdash;and
you a deacon tew&mdash;a man that makes such' high pretensions.
Brother Bedott! it's a hyneous and a
cryin' sin." "Consarn it!" says Deacon Bedott, says
he, "dew stop a minnit and let one speak; I want to
know, who said I was in a habit o' takin' tew much."
"Whoever 'twas," says Silly, says she, "they lied,
and they know'd it, and I'll tell Deacon Whipple so&mdash;lemme
come, Melissy." (It always made Silly awful
mad to have any body else run the deacon down,
though she used to give it tew him herself, like the
dragon sometimes.) "Woman alive," says I, "what
be you dewin! you shan't go out there&mdash;you'll jest
spile the hull&mdash;and we shan't hear another word&mdash;it'll
be time enough for you to put in bymeby." She
made such a noise, they'd a heerd her, if they hadent
a got to talkin' purty loud themselves. Well, she got
still; and the next thing I heerd was Deacon Kenipe
sayin', says he, "Brother Whipple, dew come to the
pint; dew tell Brother Bedott, who 'twas&mdash;and don't
hurt his feelins any more 'n you can help." "Well,
then," says Deacon Whipple, says he, "'twas yer
brother-in-law, Mr. Magwire." "Gracious sakes
alive!" says Deacon Bedott, says he, "did Josh say
that about me? What on arth did the critter mean?"
"He meant what he said, I s'ppse," says Deacon
Whipple, "that you're in a habit o' gittin' <i>corned</i> on
cider." Says Deacon Bedott, says he, "Did Josh say

<!-- page 354 -->

he'd actilly <i>seen</i> me drunk on cider?" "He meant
so, ondoubtedly," says Deacon Whipple; "tho' them
wa'n't <i>precisely</i> the words he used; he called to my
shop to-day a purpose to tell me on't, said 'twas
awful tryin' to his feelins, to be obleeged to expose
you, not only on account o' your bein' a connection o'
hisen, but 'cause he raly thought you was a worthy
man in the main; 'but,' says he, 'I dew feel as if I
couldent leave Wiggletown with a clear conshence,
without tellin' you that I've actilly know'd Deacon
Bedott to be the woss for cider!&mdash;as true as my name's
Joshuway Magwire, I've seen that man half shaved
on cider afore breakfast in the momin'.' Now, though
I hain't no very high opinion o' Mr. Magwire, bein'
he's a worldly man, and don't know nothin' about
experimental religion, I dew b'leve, he wouldent tell
such a thing as that right out and out, if 'twa'n't
true, 'specially about his brother-in-law. I should a
went right over to Parson Potter about it, if he'd ben
to hum, but he's gone a journey, you know. O, how
that man will take it to heart, when he hears ther's
such a wolf in sheep's clothin' in the midst o' his flock!
So I goes over and tells Brother Kenipe and Brother
Crosby on't. They was very onwillin' to come over
with me to labor with you to-night. I'm sorry to
say, they're ginerally slack about dewin' their duty
in cases o' deseplyne&mdash;the heft on't comes on to me,
and I'm thankful I'm always ready to lift a warnin'

<!-- page 355 -->

voice in sinners' ears, and dew my endeever to reclaim
backsliders, and my exartions has been blest beyond
my most sanguinary expectations. I hain't expected
much help from you on account o' yer poor health;
and I feel to rejoice now, that you hain't ben active
sence you've turned out to be such a hyneous transgressor&mdash;O,
Brother Bedott! if you're half shaved on
cider afore breakfast, what must be yer condition afore
night! purty well upsot I should think." Deacon
Bedott dident say a word; he said afterward he
thought he'd let Brother Whipple go on, and see how
much he <i>would</i> say. After a minnit Deacon Whipple
begun agin' and says he, "Dew you still continue to
deny it?" Deacon Bedott never opened his head.
"Well," says Deacon Whipple, says he, "silence gives
consent; so, I s'pose you don't mean to hold out no
longer, and say 'tain't a fact. Well 'tain't tew late to
repent and reform yet, I hope you'll make up yer
mind, to come forrard next Sabberday, and confess
yer besettin' sin 'afore the congregation; and mabby
you'll go to the temperance meetin' next Saturday
night, if you'r able to git out, and give an account o'
yer experence in drinkin'&mdash;reformed ineebrits does a
mense sight of good tellin' the partickler circumstances
'tendin' their downfall and reformation&mdash;and,
I should think your experence would have an attendancy
to be useful as a warnin' to moderit drinkers&mdash;by
showin' on 'em what they've got to come tew, if

<!-- page 356 -->

they ain't nipt in the bud. If you don't consent to
dew any or both o' these, why, we'll have to deal with
you, that's all. We don't want to expose you no
more'n what's necessary. I hain't said a word about
it to nobody, but jest my wife. What dew you say
to confession? laffin hey!" (You see, Deacon Bedott
begun to grin.) "O, Brother Bedott, what a tremenjuous,
sinner you be! not only to refuse to confess yer
inickities, but laff at 'em! Dew you still continner
to deny it?" Jest then, husband bust into the room;
and Jo Snyder and Shubal Green and Mr. Smith and
Doctor Pike (Artemishy's brother), and Sam Collins
(Joe's brother)&mdash;they'd followed the <i>session</i> to the
house, and ben a listenin' to the door ever sence.
Husband, he went straight up to Deacon Bedott and
shook his fist in his face, and says he, "Deny it if you
darst afore me'.&mdash;dident I see you half shaved on
cider this very mornin'? dident I empty the water out
o' yer shavin' cup onbeknown to nobody, while it was
a heatin'? and dident I fill it up with some o' Silly's
sweet cider she'd got to make sass on? and wasn't I
a settin' by when you took it off the stove? and
wasn't I a lookin' on, when you had such a dretful
time a tryin' to make yer lather? and dident I see
you scrape and saw away at your face till the blood
run? and dident I see you throw down yer razor at
last, and declare the old dragon was in it! and wasn't
you jest about <i>half shaved</i> then? say! and dident I

<!-- page 357 -->

bust out a laffin then, and tell you 'twas the fust time
I ever see you the woss for cider?&mdash;deny it, if you
darst" "I plead guilty," says Deacon Bedott, says
he. Then we wimmin folks bust out o' the buttry
into the settin' room; and ther was such a gineral
roarin' and laffin' as I never heerd afore nor sence.
Deacon Kenipe and Deacon Crosby got up and shook
hands with Deacon Bedott and axed his pardin' for
comin' over there to take him to dew&mdash;and Deacon
Bedott, he told 'em, they wa'n't to blame at all&mdash;and
Silly, she was so tickled; she lafft one minnit, and
cried the next, and eny most went into highsteerics:
and Artemishy, she laffed, and Mr. Magwire and the
men folks they hollered; and you never seen such a
time as ther was. Deacon Bedott was a very kind-hearted
man, and he thought they was a most tew
hard on Deacon Whipple, so he turned round to apoligize
to him, and lo and behold! he'd took advantage
o' the commotion and slipt out. But though Deacon
Bedott tried to look sober, and told husband 'twas tew
bad to play off such a joke&mdash;'twas plain to be seen he
wa'n't sorry to see Deacon Whipple come up with.
Poor Deacon Whipple! 'twas a humblin' stroke tew
him&mdash;every body was throwin' on't in his face&mdash;he
couldent go no wher, but what <i>that cider</i> was throw'd
in his face. And Miss Whipple tew&mdash;she felt awful
mean about it&mdash;you see she'd ben all round the naborhood
a tellin' that Deacon Bedott was a drinkin'

<!-- page 358 -->

man. But it cured Deacon Whipple of his <i>consarn
for the welfare o' Zion;</i> he never made another complaint
aginst nobody while he lived there; and about
six months afterward, he moved away from Wiggletown.</p>

<h3>XXIX.</h3>

<h3>Mrs. Mudlaw's Recipe for Potato Pudding.</h3>

</div>

<p>MR. John Darling, a worthy and intelligent mechanic,
who has been, for two years past, a resident
of our town, was somewhat surprised and considerably
gratified one day last fall, at receiving an invitation
to dine with Colonel Philpot, one of the aristocracy.</p>

<p>Mr. Darling enjoys that respect in our community
which mechanical ingenuity and integrity united are
always sure to command every where. These qualities,
and a more than ordinary degree of information,
acquired by the employment of much of his leisure
time in reading, have given him an almost unbounded
influence among his own class.</p>

<p>Though the invitation to Colonel P.'s created some
surprise in his mind, he felt more disposed to be pleased
at the honor than to question the motives which
prompted it; for his nature is wholly free from suspicion
and the petty feeling of jealousy which those in
his station sometimes indulge toward the "upper ten"&mdash;feelings

<!-- page 360 -->

with which, we are sorry to say, the bosom
of his better half was frequently agitated.</p>

<p>"We have been neighbors for some time, Mr. Darling,"
said Colonel Philpot; "it is time we were better
acquainted. You must come and dine socially with
me to-morrow. Mrs. Philpot and the children are out
of town, and I am going to have a few friends to enliven
my solitude."</p>

<p>So John Darling "saved his appetite," dressed himself
in his best clothes, and, at the appointed hour&mdash;a
somewhat later one than his customary time for dining&mdash;repaired
to Colonel Philpot's.</p>

<p>He met there several of his associates&mdash;had a "fine
time and a grand dinner"&mdash;the utmost hilarity and
good feeling prevailed; and Mr. Darling entertained
his wife with an account of it at every meal for several
weeks.</p>

<p>"Hester," said he one day, as they were seated at a
codfish dinner, "did you ever taste a potato pudding?"</p>

<p>"Potato pudding! No; I never heerd of such a
thing."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish you could, for 'tis delicious! We
had one when I dined at Colonel Philpot's."</p>

<p>"I wonder what you <i>didn't</i> have at Colonel Philpot's,"
said Mrs. Darling. "I declare, I'm tired hearing
about it."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you one thing we didn't have&mdash;we

<!-- page 361 -->

didn't have <i>codfish</i>. But, that pudding&mdash;I wish you'd
learn how to make it; it was superb!"</p>

<p>"I presume so; and I guess, if I had half a dozen
servants at my heels, and a thorough-trained cook into
the bargain, I could have things superb, too. But, as
long as I have every thing to do myself, and very
little <i>to do with</i>, I don't see how I'm to get up things
in style. I wonder you can expect me to."</p>

<p>"I don't expect you to, Hester. You always do
things to suit my taste. But that pudding was excellent;
and, being made of potatoes, I thought, of course
it must be economical, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Economical! That's all you know about it.
What gumps men are! I'll warrant it had forty different
things in it, and less potatoes than any thing
else. I'm no hand to fuss up. I like plain cookery,
for my part."</p>

<p>"So do I, as a general thing. But then, you know,
it's well to have something a little better than ordinary
once in a while."</p>

<p>"Well, if you're not satisfied with my way of
doing things, you must hire a cook, or go and board
out." And Mrs. Darling put on her <i>injured look</i>, and
remained silent during the rest of the dinner.</p>

<p>But, after all, she was not an ill-natured woman
really; and, after her husband had gone to his shop,
she began to feal a little pricked in her conscience for
having been so cross at dinner. She wished she had

<!-- page 362 -->

not <i>gone on</i> at such a rate. But, then, John had bored
her so about that dinner at Colonel Philpot's, she was
out of patience with it. Yet what right had she to be
out of patience with John? He never was out of patience
with her, and she could but acknowledge that
he often had reason to be so. So she resolved to make
it up as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"John," said she, as she handed him a cup of tea,
"I've a great notion to try that potato pudding. I
believe I could make one."</p>

<p>"No doubt of it, Hester," said her husband; "you
can do almost any thing you try to."</p>

<p>"I suppose it takes butter, and sugar, and eggs, and
spices, and so forth; but I wish I knew the proportions."</p>

<p>"It's very easy to find out all about it by calling at
Colonel Philpot's. He said his wife would be delighted
to get acquainted with you."</p>

<p>"So you've told me a dozen times; but I think
that, if she wanted to get acquainted with me she
might call upon me. She's lived here longer than I
have, and it isn't my place to call first; and I don't
believe the colonel tells the truth when he says she
wants to get acquainted with me."</p>

<p>"Well, I always think people mean as they say,
and I wish you would, too, Hester."</p>

<p>"But it's very evident that she holds herself a great
deal above me. She has no reason to, certainly, for

<!-- page 363 -->

her family wasn't half as respectable as mine. Mrs.
David Potter knows all about them, root and branch,
and she says that Mrs. Philpot's father kept a very low
tavern in Norridge, and Mrs. Philpot herself tended
the bar when she was a girl. But, somehow, Colonel
Philpot happened to fall in love with her, and he sent
her away to school, and then married her."</p>

<p>"Well, that's nothing against her, is it?"</p>

<p>"No, of course it wouldn't be, if she didn't carry
her head so high now. But it's always the way with
such persons&mdash;they never know how to bear prosperity.
There wouldn't be any thing said about her origin,
if she didn't put on such airs; but, as long as
she feels so lifted up, folks <i>will talk</i> you know."

<p>"Perhaps you don't do her justice, Hester. You
know nothing about her excepting what you've heard.
At any rate, it would do no harm to call upon her."</p>

<p>After repeated conversations and discussions of this
sort, Mrs. Darling concluded to pay Mrs. Philpot a
visit. She could make the potato pudding an excuse,
and be governed by Mrs. P.'s reception in regard to
further intercourse. Mrs. Philpot has been, for several
years past, to use her own expression, "very unfortunate
in her domestics." With the exception of her
cook&mdash;up to the time of Mrs. Darling's call&mdash;she had
seldom kept one above a month, and sometimes not as
long as that. This frequent change of servants was
not so much owing to any unkindness on Mrs. Philpot's

<!-- page 364 -->

part, as to the fact that Mrs. Mudlaw, her cook,
could never agree with them. This functionary had
been, for several years, a fixture in Colonel P.'s establishment;
indeed, Mrs. P. declared she could not possibly
get along without her. Mrs. Mudlaw was in
fact, a good cook, and so entirely relieved that lady
from all care in that department that, rather than part
with her, she was willing to submit to her petty tyranny
in every thing. The cook actually "ruled the
roast" at Colonel P.'s in more than one sense. And
she did not often find the subalterns of the household
as submissive to her wishes as Mrs. Philpot herself
was. She contrived to quarrel them away in a
short time, for she had only to say to Mrs. P., "Well,
either Bridget or I must quit, so you may take your
choice;" and the offending servant-maid was dismissed
forthwith, there being no appeal from Mrs. Mudlaw's
decision.</p>

<p>A scene of this kind had just occurred when Mrs.
Darling made her visit, and a new raw Irish girl had
that morning been installed in place of the one discharged.
The duty of this girl was to answer the
door-bell, and help Mrs. Mudlaw. In fact, the hardest
and most disagreeable of the kitchen-work came
upon her. When Mrs. Darling rang, Mrs. Philpot
was in the kitchen giving instructions to Peggy, or
rather acquiescing in those which Mrs. Mudlaw was
laying down.</p>

<!-- page 365 -->

<p>"There goes the bell," said that important personage,
and Mrs. Philpot hastened to an upper window to
see who it was. Having satisfied herself, she came
back and told Peggy to go and admit the lady.</p>

<p>"Why don't you start, you?" said Mrs. Mudlaw.</p>

<p>"Well, what'll I do now?" said Peggy, whirling
round in that bewildered way peculiar to Irish girls.</p>

<p>"Do!" roared Mudlaw. "Don't you know nothin'?
Hain't we jest been tellin' ye 'twas your duty to tend
to the door-bell? Run to the front door and let 'em
in, and show 'em into the drawin'-room. You know
where that is, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Faith, I know that" answered Peggy, and away
she ran, thanking her stars that there was at least one
thing that she knew.</p>

<p>"It's no one that' I know, I'm sure," said Mrs.
Philpot, after Peggy had gone; "at least the bonnet
and shawl are not familiar to me. I presume it is
somebody I don't care about seeing."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder," said Mudlaw. "But I
s'pose you couldn't do otherways, as the curnel has
given orders that nobody ain't to be refused till after
'<i>lection</i>."</p>

<p>With much confusion and toe-stubbling, the unfortunate
Peggy ushered Mrs. Darling into the nursery,
which was also Mrs. Philpot's ordinary sitting-room.
It was directly over the kitchen, and heated by the
cooking stove by the means of a drum, or dummy, as

<!-- page 366 -->

Mrs. Mudlaw called it. Every word that was said in
the kitchen could easily be heard in the nursery&mdash;quite
a convenience to Mudlaw, as it enabled her often
to communicate with Mrs. Philpot without the trouble
of going up stairs. Many an interesting account of
what she did when Mr. Mudlaw was living, and how
they managed at General K.'s when she <i>was staying</i>
there, has gone up that stove-pipe.</p>

<p>The nursery was in a state of the greatest disorder,
as was usually the case, though the children were all
out just then. Sukey the nurse-girl, had taken the
baby out to ride, and Philip Augustus had gone with
them; and Zoe Matilda was at school. Playthings of
every description, darts, horses, dolls, as well as children's
books and clothes, were scattered about the room
in what Mrs. Darling called "awful confusion." But
she had not time for inward comments upon this state
of things, before her attention was called to the conversation
below.</p>

<p>"It's Mrs. Darling as wushes to see you mum,"
said Peggy.</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> Mrs. Darling! Did you ever!" exclaimed
Mrs. Philpot.</p>

<p>"She ain't nobody, is she?" said Mrs. Mudlaw.</p>

<p>"Nobody at all. Her husband is a cabinet-maker;
but the colonel has charged it upon me to be polite to
her jest now. He wished me to call upon her; but I
wouldn't condescend to stoop so low as that, though

<!-- page 367 -->

he made me promise to treat her with attention if she
called."</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldent do it, if I was you," said the
cook. "I'd be mistress in my own house any how."</p>

<p>"But, you know, it's for his interest now. He
says that Darling has a great deal of influence among
mechanics&mdash;can command a good many votes."</p>

<p>"Oh, I remember now! he's one of them codgers
that dined here while you was away, that the curnel
was a laughin' about afterward, and telling you how
awkward they handled the silver forks."</p>

<p>"Yes; isn't it provoking to have to be polite to
such people? Well, I shall be glad when 'lection's
over, for the colonel says I may cut them all then,
and I think it won't be long before they sink back to
their own level." And Mrs. Philpot arose with a sigh,
and ascended to the drawing-room, arranging her
features into a gracious and patronizing expression as
she went.</p>

<p>Mrs. Darling's feelings during this conversation
"can be better imagined than described," as the novels
would say. Her first impulse was to leave the house
without waiting for Mrs. Philpot's appearance, and she
rose and made a few steps with that intention; but,
on second thoughts, she resolved to remain, and let
her know that she only came on an errand, and resumed
her seat.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Philpot found no one in the drawing-room

<!-- page 368 -->

she returned to the kitchen, supposing that her
visitor had gone.</p>

<p>"She's gone," said she, "without waiting for me.
She doesn't know enough about good society to understand
that a lady doesn't make her appearance the
moment she's called for."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder if she was in the nursery all
the time," said Mudlaw; "for I heard a stepping up
there a while ago, and the children hain't got home
yet. Where did you take her to, you?"</p>

<p>"Why, I tuck her in the dhrawin'-room, sure, as
you tould me, right overhid," said Peggy, in some
alarm.</p>

<p>"You blunderin' Irish gumphead! Don't you
know the drawin'-room from the nursery?"</p>

<p>"Och! but I thought it was the dhrawin'-room;
for dident I see the young masther a dhrawin' his cart,
and wasn't Shukey a dhrawin' the baby about the
floore by its feet, when I went up to take the wather
this mornin'?"</p>

<p>"There, I told you she was a born fool!" said Mudlaw,
in a rage. "She'll never know nothing&mdash;she'll
never learn nothing&mdash;you may as well send her off
first as last."</p>

<p>"Hush! don't speak so loud," said Mrs. Philpot, in
a whisper. "She can hear all you say&mdash;she has heard
enough already. Dear me, what <i>shall</i> I do? The
colonel will be so provoked! How could you be so

<!-- page 369 -->

dumb, Peggy? Run right up and take her into the
drawing-room. Stop! you needn't; you will make
some other mistake. I'll go myself."</p>

<p>In a state of mind not to be envied, Mrs. Philpot
hastened to the nursery. But as she entertained a
faint hope that the conversation below had not penetrated
through Mrs. Darling's bonnet, she endeavored
to hide her embarrassment under an affable smile, extended
her hand gracefully, and drawled out a genteel
welcome to her visitor.</p>

<p>"Delighted to see you, Mrs. Darling; but very
sorry you should have been brought into the nursery"&mdash;no
wonder she's sorry, thought Mrs. Darling&mdash;"these
raw Irish girls are so stupid! Walk into the
parlor, if you please."</p>

<p>"No, I thank you, Mrs. Philpot, I'd as soon sit
here," returned Mrs. Darling. "I can only stay a
moment. I called to ask for a recipe for potato pudding.
Mr. Darling tasted one when he dined with
Colonel Philpot, and liked it so much that he wished
me to get directions for making it."</p>

<p>"Potato pudding? Ah, yes, I recollect. Mudlaw,
my cook, does make a very good plain thing that she
calls a potato pudding; but I know nothing about her
manner of preparing it. I will call her, however, and
she shall tell you herself." Thereupon she pulled the
bell, and Peggy shortly appeared, looking more
frightened and bewildered than ever.</p>

<!-- page 370 -->

<p>"Send Mudlaw here," said Mrs. Philpot.</p>

<p>She would not have dared to address her "chief
cook and bottle-washer" without the respectful title of
<i>Mrs</i>.; but it was rather more grand to omit it, and she
always did so when not in her hearing.</p>

<p>"The missus said I was to send you there," said
Peggy.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> send <i>me!</i>" exclaimed the indignant cook;
"I guess when I go for <i>your</i> sending, it'll be after
this."</p>

<p>Mrs. Philpot, although conversing in a condescending
manner with Mrs. Darling, caught something of the
cook's reply to her summons, and asked to be excused
for a moment, saying that Peggy was so stupid, she
feared that Mudlaw might not understand her, and
she would go herself and send her. So she hastened
down to the kitchen, where she found the head functionary
standing on her dignity.</p>

<p>"Pretty well," said she, "if I am to be ordered
round by an Irish scullion!"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mudlaw, step here a moment, if you please,"
said Mrs. Philpot meekly, opening the door of an adjoining
room.</p>

<p>The offended lady vouchsafed to comply with the
request, and with a stern aspect, entered the room
with Mrs. Philpot. The latter closed the door for fear
of being heard overhead, and began&mdash;</p>

<p>"What do you think, Mrs. Mudlaw? That Mrs.

<!-- page 371 -->

Darling has come to learn how to make potato pudding,
and you'll have to go up and tell her."</p>

<p>"I sha'n't do it. I make it a point never to give
my recipes to nobody."</p>

<p>"I know it; and, I'm sure I don't blame you.
But, in this case&mdash;just now&mdash;I really don't see how
we can refuse."</p>

<p>"Well, I sha'n't do it, and that's the hull on't."</p>

<p>"Oh, do, Mrs. Mudlaw, just this once. The colonel
is so anxious to secure Darling, and he will be so
angry if we offend them in any way."</p>

<p>"But he needent know it, need he?"</p>

<p>"He certainly will find it out by some means. I
know it is real vexatious to you, and I wouldn't ask
it if election was over; and now 'tis very important&mdash;it
may save us all trouble. The colonel is so decided
you know."</p>

<p>These last words of Mrs. Philpot had an effect
upon Mudlaw which no wish or entreaty of that lady
would have ever produced, for they suggested to her
selfish mind the possibility of a dismissal from her
snug berth at Colonel P.'s, where she carried it with a
high hand; so she gave in.</p>

<p>"Well, jest to please you and the curnel, I'll do it;
but I wish 'lection was over."</p>

<p>Mrs. Philpot returned to the nursery, and Mrs.
Mudlaw took off her apron, changed her cap for one
trimmed with pink ribbons and blue roses, gave numerous

<!-- page 372 -->

orders to Peggy, and followed. She was a
short, fat woman, with a broad red face&mdash;such a person
as a stranger would call the very personification
of good nature; though I have never found fat people
to be any more amiable than lean ones. Certainly,
Mrs. Mudlaw was not a very sweet tempered woman.
On this occasion, she felt rather more cross than usual,
forced, as she was, to give one of her recipes to a nobody.
She, however, knew the necessity of assuming
a pleasant demeanor at that time, and accordingly entered
the nursery with an encouraging grin on her
blazing countenance. Mrs. Philpot, fearing lest her
cook's familiarity might belittle her mistress in the
eyes of Mrs. Darling, and again asking to be excused
for a short time, went into the library, a nondescript
appartment, dignified by that name, which communicated
with the nursery. The moment she left her seat,
a large rocking-chair, Mudlaw dumped herself down
it, exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Philpot says you want to get my recipe for
potater puddin'?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mrs. Darling. "I would be obliged
to you for the directions." And she took out of her
pocket a pencil and paper to write it down.</p>

<p>"Well, 'tis an excellent puddin'," said Mudlaw,
complacently; "for my part, I like it about as well as
any puddin' I make, and that's sayin' a good deal, I
can tell you, for I understand makin' a great variety.

<!-- page 373 -->

'Tain't so awful rich as some; to be sure. Now,
there's the Cardinelle puddin', and the Washington
puddin', and the Lay Fayette puddin', and the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. Mr. Darling liked it very much&mdash;how do
you make it?"</p>

<p>"Wal, I peel my potaters and bile 'em in fair water.
I always let the water bile before I put 'em in. Some
folks let their potaters lie and sog in the water ever so
long, before it biles; but I think it spiles 'em. I always
make it a pint to have the water bile&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How many potatoes?"</p>

<p>"Wal, I always take about as many potaters as I
think I shall want. I'm generally governed by the
size o' the puddin' I want to make. If it's a large
puddin', why I take quite a number, but if it's a small
one, why, then I don't take as many. As quick as
they're done, I take 'em up and mash 'em as fine as I
can get 'em. I'm always very partic'lar about <i>that</i>&mdash;some
folks ain't; they'll let their potaters be full o'
lumps, <i>I</i> never do; if there's any thing I hate, it's
lumps in potaters. I <i>won't</i> have 'em. Whether I'm
mashin' potaters for puddin's or for vegetable use, I
mash it till there ain't the size of a lump in it. If I
can't git it fine without sifting, why I <i>sift</i> it. Once in
a while, when I'm otherways engaged, I set the girl
to mashin' on't. Wal, she'll give it three or four
jams, and come along, 'Miss Mudlaw, is the potater
fine enough?' Jubiter Rammin! that's the time I

<!-- page 374 -->

come as near gittin' mad as I ever allow myself to
come, for I make it a pint never to have lumps&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it is very important. What next?"</p>

<p>"Wal, then I put in my butter; in winter time I
melt it a little, not enough to make it ily, but jest so's
to soften it."</p>

<p>"How much butter does it require?"</p>

<p>"Wal I always take butter accordin' to the size of
the puddin'; a large puddin' needs a good sized lump
o' butter, but not too much. And I'm always partic'lar
to have my butter fresh and sweet. Some folks
think it's no matter what sort o' butter they use for
cookin', but I don't. Of all things, I do despise strong
frowy, rancid butter. For pity's sake have your butter
fresh."</p>

<p>"How much butter did you say?"</p>

<p>"Wal, that depends, as I said before, on what sized
puddin' you want to make. And another thing that
regulates the quality of butter I use is the 'mount o'
cream I take. I always put in more or less cream;
when I have abundance o' cream, I put in considerable
and when it's scarce, why, I use more butter than I
otherways should. But you must be partic'lar not to
get in too much cream. There's a great deal in havin'
jest the right quantity; and so 'tis with all the ingrejiences.
There ain't a better puddin' in the world
than a potato puddin', when it's made <i>right</i>, but 'tain't
every body that makes 'em right. I remember when

<!-- page 375 -->

I lived in Tuckertown, I was' a visitin' to Squire Humprey's
one time&mdash;I went in the first company in Tuckertown&mdash;dear
me! this is a changeable world. Wal,
they had what they called a potato puddin' for dinner,
Good land! Of all the puddins! I've often occured
to that puddin' since, and wondered what the
Squire's wife was a thinkin' of when she made it. I
wa'n't obleeged to do no such things in them days,
and dident know how to do any thing as well as I do
now. Necessity's the mother of invention. Experience
is the best teacher, after all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you sweeten it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, to be sure it needs sugar, the best o'
sugar, too; not this wet, soggy, brown sugar. Some
folks never think o' usin' good sugar to cook with, but
for my part I won't have no other."</p>

<p>"How much sugar do you take?"</p>

<p>"Wal, that depends altogether on whether you calculate
to have sass for it&mdash;some like sass, you know,
and then some agin don't. So, when I calculate for
sass, I don't take so much sugar; and when I don't
calculate for sass, I make it sweet enough to eat without
sass. Poor Mr. Mudlaw was a great hand for
puddin' sass. I always made it for him&mdash;good, rich
sass too. I could afford to have things rich before he
was unfortinate in bizness." (Mudlaw went to State's
prison for horse-stealing.) "I like sass myself, too;
and the curnel and the children are all great sass

<!-- page 376 -->

hands; and so I generally calculate for sass, though
Miss Philpot prefers the puddin' without sass, and perhaps
<i>you'd</i> prefer it without. If so you must put in
sugar accordingly. I always make it a pint to have
'em sweet enough when they're to be eat without
sass."</p>

<p>"And don't you use eggs?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, eggs is one o' the principal ingrejiences."</p>

<p>"How many does it require?"</p>

<p>"Wal, when eggs is plenty I always use plenty;
and when they're scarce, why I can do with less,
though I'd ruther have enough; and be sure and beat
'em well. It does distress me, the way some folks
beat eggs. I always want to have 'em thoroughly
beat for every thing I use 'em in. It tries my patience
most awfully to have any body round me that won't
beat eggs enough. A spell ago we had a darkey to
help in the kitchen. One day I was a makin' sponge
cake, and havin' occasion to go up stairs after something,
I sot her to beatin' the eggs. Wal, what do
you think the critter done? Why, she whisked 'em
round a few times, and turned 'em right onto the
other ingrejiences that I'd got weighed out. When I
come back and saw what she'd done, my gracious! I
came as nigh to losin' my temper as I ever allow myself
to come. 'Twas awful provokin'! I always
want the kitchen help to do things as I want to have

<!-- page 377 -->

'em done. But I never saw a darkey yet that ever
done any thing right, They're a lazy slaughterin'
set. To think o' her spilin' that cake so, when I'd
told her over and over agin that I always made it a
pint to have my eggs thoroughly beat!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was too bad. Do you use fruit in the pudding?"</p>

<p>"Wal, that's jest as you please. You'd better be
governed by your own judgment as to <i>that</i>. Some
like currants and some like raisins, and then agin some
don't like nary one. If you use raisins, for pity's
sake pick out the stuns. It's awful to have a body's
teeth come grindin' onto a raisin stun. I'd rather
have my ears boxt any time."</p>

<p>"How many raisins must I take?"</p>

<p>"Wal not <i>too</i> many&mdash;it's apt to mke the puddin'
heavy, you know; and when it's heavy it ain't so
light and good. I'm a great hand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, what do'you use for flavoring?"</p>

<p>"There agin you'll have to exercise your own
judgment. Some likes one thing, and some another,
you know. If you go the whole figger on temperance,
why some other kind o' flavyrin'll do as well as wine
or brandy, I s'pose. But whatever you make up your
mind to use, be partic'lar to git in a sufficiency, or
else your puddin'll be flat. I always make it a
pint&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How long must it bake?"</p>

<!-- page 378 -->

<p>"There's the great thing after all. The bakin's the
main pint. A potater puddin', of all puddins, has got
to be baked jest right. For if it bakes a leetle too
much, it's apt to dry it up; and 'then agin if it don't
bake quite enough, it's sure to taste potatery&mdash;and
that spiles it, you know."</p>

<p>"How long should you think?"</p>

<p>"Wal, that depends a good deal on the heat o' your
oven. If you have a very hot oven, 'twon't do to
leave it in too long; and if your oven ain't so very
hot, why, you'll be necessiated to leave it in longer."</p>

<p>"Well, how can I tell any thing about, it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I always let them bake till I think they're
done&mdash;that's the safest way. I make it a pint to have
'em baked exactly right. It's very important in all
kinds o' bakin'&mdash;cake, pies, bread, puddins, and
every thing&mdash;to have'em baked <i>precisely</i> long enough
and jest right. Some folks don't seem to have no system
at all about their bakin'. One time they'll burn
their bread to a crisp, and then agin it'll be so slack
'tain't fit to eat. Nothin' hurts my feelins so much
as to see things overdone or slack-baked. Here only
t'other day, Lorry, the girl that Miss Philpot dismissed
yesterday, come within an ace o' letting my
bread burn up. My back was turned for a minnit,
and what should she do but go to stuffin' wood into the
stove' at the awfullest rate? If I hadent a found it
out jest when I did, my bread would a ben spilt as

<!-- page 379 -->

sure as I'm a live woman. Jubiter Rammin! I was
about as much decomposed as I ever allow myself to
git! I told Miss Philpot I wouldent stan' it no longer&mdash;one
of us must quit&mdash;either Lorry or me must
walk."</p>

<p>"So you've no rule about baking this pudding?"</p>

<p>"No rule!" said Mudlaw, with a look of intense
surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Darling, "you seem to have no
rule for any thing about it."</p>

<p>"No rule!" screamed the indignant cook, starting
up, while her red face grew ten times redder, and her
little black eyes snapped with rage. "No rules!" and
she planted herself in front of Mrs. Darling, erecting
her fleshy figure to its full hight of majestic dumpiness,
and extending the forefinger of her right hand
till it reached an alarming propinquity to that lady's
nose. "No rules! do <i>you</i> tell <i>me</i> I've no rules! Me!
that's cooked in the first families for fifteen years, and
always gi'n satisfaction, to be told by such as <i>you</i> that
I hain't no rules!"</p>

<p>Thus far had Mudlaw proceeded, and I know not
to what length she would have "allowed herself" to
go, had not the sudden entrance of Colonel Philpot
interrupted her. He being a person of whom she
stood somewhat in awe, particularly "jest at this time,"
she broke off in the midst of her tirade, and, casting a
look of ineffable disgust at Mrs. Darling, retreated to

<!-- page 380 -->

her own dominions to vent her fury upon poor Peggy,
who had done every thing wrong during her absence.</p>

<p>While Colonel Philpot was expressing his extreme
satisfaction at seeing Mrs. Darling, Mrs. Philpot
emerged from the library, where she had been shaking
in her shoes during the interview between that
lady and Mudlaw.</p>

<p>"Matilda, my dear," said the colonel, "this is quite
an unexpected pleasure, for really Mrs. Darling, we
began to fear that you did not intend to cultivate
us."</p>

<p>"I did not come for that purpose," replied Mrs. Darling,
who, now that she saw through Colonel Philpot,
despised him thoroughly, and was not afraid to let
him know it, notwithstanding he belonged to the aristocracy
of our town. "I came on an errand, and
your cook has got very angry with me for some reason,
I scarcely know what."</p>

<p>"Poor Mudlaw," said Mrs. Philpot, anxious to
screen her main stay from the colonel's displeasure,
yet feeling the necessity of some apology to Mrs. Darling.
"Poor Mudlaw! I don't think she intended to
be rude."</p>

<p>"What! has the cook been rude to Mrs. Darling?"
exclaimed Colonel Philpot.</p>

<p>"Not rude, exactly, dear; but you know she is so
sensitive about every thing connected with her department,

<!-- page 381 -->

and she fancied that Mrs. Darling called her
skill into question, and became somewhat excited."</p>

<p>"<i>Quite</i> excited, I should call it," said Mrs. D. with
a smile.</p>

<p>"And she has dared to treat Mrs. Darling rudely,"
said Colonel P., apparently much agitated. "Shameful!
disgraceful! the wretch shall suffer for it! To
think that a lady like Mrs. Darling should be insulted
by a <i>cook!</i> in my house, too!"</p>

<p>"And just before <i>election</i>, too; it is a pity!" said
Mrs. Darling quietly, as she rose, and wishing them
good-morning, departed, leaving Colonel Philpot lost
in astonishment. Her last remark rendered necessary
some explanation from Mrs. P. She was compelled
to repeat some part of the' conversation that had taken
place in the kitchen, which, though softened down as
much as possible, was sufficient to rouse the colonel's
indignation to the highest pitch, for he saw at once
that Darling was lost. He gave his silly wife a hearty
blowing up, but upon Mudlaw, his wrath fell heaviest.
No entreaties of her mistress could save her; she was
commanded to quit the premises, to <i>troop forthwith</i>
"for being rude to visitors." But Mudlaw knew well
enough the real reason of her dismissal, and when
she went forth in rage and sorrow, she found some
consolation in spreading it far and wide, thereby making
Colonel Philpot very ridiculous in the eyes of the
community.</p>

<!-- page 382 -->

<p>"Well, I'm surprised, Hester," said John Darling,
after his wife had given him a circumstantial account
of her visit. "And I'm right sorry, too, to have my
good opinion of a man knocked in the head so, for I
did think well of Col. Philpot. I really believed we
couldn't send a better man to Congress. But it won't
do. A man that can stoop to such conduct isn't fit
to go there. I can't vote for him, and my influence,
what little I have, must go against him. If he gets
there, it must be without any help from John Darling."</p>

<p>Colonel Philpot did <i>not</i> go to Congress, and what
made his defeat the more aggravating was the fact that
his opponent was elected by the small majority of
three votes. And so Colonel Philpot lost his election;
and Mrs. Philpot lost her cook; and Mr. Darling
lost his esteem for Colonel Philpot, and all through
the over-politeness of the latter.

<p>And was there nothing gained? Oh, yes; Mrs.
Darling gained something. Not much information in
regard to the potato pudding, certainly; but she
gained some knowledge of the internal arrangements
of Mrs. Philpot's household, which proved of great
service to her, for she confesses to John that she was
never so contented with her own home and her own
husband as she has been since she made that memorable
call at Colonel Philpot's.</p>

not been at all neighborly of late."</p>

<p>"I know it, Mrs. Shaw, but you must excuse us,
for grandmother has been so feeble for some weeks
past that we have not been able to leave&mdash;mother is
with her now and desires to be excused."</p>

<p>"Certainly; she is very excusable. I was not
aware that your grandmother was sick&mdash;I'm excessively
sorry to hear it&mdash;should assuredly have been
round to see her before had I been aware of her illness.
I <i>do</i> think <i>so</i> much of your grandmother&mdash;she
is certainly the sweetest old lady that I ever knew. I
tell Mr. Shaw she reminds me <i>so</i> much of my own
dear dead mother&mdash;has the same dignified manner and
benevolent countenance that she had. And her character

<!-- page 384 -->

is very much like my mother's, too, always doing
good among the poor and sick. I regret excessively
that I was not aware of her illness&mdash;should certainly
have been round, though my own health has been
very precarious&mdash;in fact, it always is&mdash;I go out very
little&mdash;none at all excepting among my particular
friends. I <i>do</i> hope your grandma'll be spared&mdash;we
<i>couldn't</i> part with her any way&mdash;there are so few like
her on earth&mdash;and the poet says 'Heaven is overflowing.'
Ah! I see you have Dickens' last here&mdash;I suppose
it's excessively interesting."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I think it's hardly worth reading."</p>

<p>"Indeed! well, of course I shall not read it if you
condemn it&mdash;you are such an excellent judge of literature,
and <i>such</i> a reader&mdash;your own productions, too,
are exquisite&mdash;Mr. Shaw is perfectly charmed with
them. What a beauty your japonica is, I noticed it
last evening in passing. Ah! that reminds me they
tell stories about you, Mary."</p>

<p>"Indeed! what do they say about me, pray?"</p>

<p>"O, they say you're going to be married."</p>

<p>"The deuce I am! To whom are <i>they</i> going to
marry me?"</p>

<p>"My stars! I protest you counterfeit astonishment
to perfection. Of course the favored one is George
Carter&mdash;and I assure you, Mary, you're quite the
envy of all the girls for snapping him up so soon after
his return from Europe."</p>

<!-- page 385 -->

<p>"You surprise me Mrs. Shaw. I've seen very little
of George Carter since he came home."</p>

<p>"Ah, do you think I shall believe you when appearances
are so very strong against you? Didn't I
see somebody's curly dog lying on somebody's piazza
last evening?"</p>

<p>"And seeing a puppy <i>outside</i> of the door, it was
very natural for <i>you</i> to infer that there was another one
<i>inside</i>."</p>

<p>"O Mary, what a creature you are! You have
such a ready wit. Mr. Shaw says he never knew
your equal in that respect&mdash;he <i>does</i> admire wit in a
lady, excessively. But I'll not detain you&mdash;give my
love to your ma, and your grandma, too&mdash;and tell her
how deeply interested I feel in her&mdash;I do hope she'll
recover. And do you and your ma come round and
see us as soon as you can. Serapheen and I think <i>so</i>
much of seeing our friends&mdash;your ma and you particularly&mdash;and
we're <i>so</i> lonely since Angeleen went to
New York."</p>

<p>"Have you heard from Angeleen lately?"

<p>"Yes, we received a letter, yesterday. She says,
give my love to all the girls, but particularly to Mary
Barber. Angel does think so much of you. (Miss
Barber bows.) She's enjoying herself excessively&mdash;sees
a great deal of company. You know how it is
in the city, Mary&mdash;you've spent so much time there.

<!-- page 386 -->

She says she dreads coming back to this dull place excessively."</p>

<p>"Well then I hope she'll <i>snap up</i> somebody in the
city, and not be compelled to come back here."</p>

<p>"What a quiz you are, Mary! but I <i>must</i> go&mdash;give
my love to your ma, and do come round when you
can. Good morning."</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mrs. Shaw."</p>

<p>Her next call is at Dr. More's.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Caroline. Is your ma at home?"</p>

<p>"She is. She's engaged jest now in the kitchen,
but she'll be in shortly."</p>

<p>"Now don't let me hinder you if your engaged
about any thing&mdash;just take me right in where you're
at work."</p>

<p>"Well, then, walk into the sitting-room, if you
please&mdash;Charlotte and I are sewing there."</p>

<p>"Good morning, Charlotte! Dress-making, eh? Is
that for you or Caroline?"</p>

<p>"For me&mdash;but Caroline has one like it. Do you
think it pretty?"</p>

<p>"I do <i>so</i>. Those large plaids are excessively becoming
to a tall slender person like you and Caroline&mdash;but
Mary Barber looks wretchedly in them&mdash;she's
<i>so</i> short and <i>so</i> thick. I was just in there&mdash;she had
on a plaid, the squares, without exaggeration, as large
as my two hands&mdash;it was blue, too, and you know
she is <i>so</i> dark."

<!-- page 387 -->

<p>"I should think it would be unbecoming to her&mdash;but
Mary cares very little for dress, I think."</p>

<p>"She does <i>so</i>&mdash;an unpardonable fault in a young
lady, in my opinion. Mr. Shaw thinks a young lady
should be always neatly and becomingly dressed. He
was speaking of it the other day, and contrasting your
two girls with Mary Barber. 'But,' said he, 'Mary
might be ever so well dressed and she wouldn't look
any how with such a form as she has.' You were
passing our house at the time&mdash;said he, 'there's a
couple of the finest forms in Greenville.' Mr. Shaw
<i>does</i> admire a fine form in a lady excessively. But
Mary's so busy writing those nonsensical stories and
stuff that she has no time to think of her personal appearance.
Did you ever read any thing <i>so</i> flat?
What a pity that she so mistakes her talent. Mr.
Shaw laughs about it&mdash;he <i>does</i> dislike a blue stocking
excessively. And, Caroline, don't you think Mary is
very unrefined in her conversation?"</p>

<p>"I think she's rather abrupt, sometimes."</p>

<p>"Abrupt! my stars! I tell Mr. Shaw that what she
intends for wit, I call essential vulgarity; and Mr.
Shaw agrees with me&mdash;he does dislike such things in
a young lady, excessively. I think she's rather censorious
too&mdash;for instance she pronounced George Carter
a puppy&mdash;at which I confess I am astonished."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm astonished too&mdash;for I think George Carter
a fine fellow."</p>

<!-- page 388 -->

<p>"He is so, Charlotte. Serapheen thinks him decidedly
elegant; and you know she's competent to give
an opinion&mdash;having passed two winters in New York,
where she saw a great deal of gentlemen's society. I
was excessively sorry to hear Mary speak so; but I
hope you won't repeat it; at least don't mention it as
coming from me. I merely alluded to it because I
felt so indignant at the remark."</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mrs. Shaw."</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mrs. More; how's your health?"</p>

<p>"Very good, indeed&mdash;are you well, Mrs. Shaw?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Mrs. More. I'm miserable; indeed I
ought to be at home and in bed now; but I told Mr.
Shaw that the morning was <i>so</i> fine, I must come round
to see you. I don't pretend to call except upon my
particular friends. Mr. Shaw often tells me I make a
complete hermit of myself&mdash;I hope I'm not hindering
you this morning, Mrs. More."</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all&mdash;you must excuse me for not coming
in sooner. I was just baking and couldn't well
leave my bread."</p>

<p>"Just <i>so</i>&mdash;you're very excusable&mdash;you do your own
work, Mrs. More, I believe."</p>

<p>"Yes, our family is small&mdash;only Dr. More and us
three&mdash;and since the girls were old enough to help
me, I've preferred doing without servants."</p>

<p>"Well now&mdash;what a grand thing that is! I tell
Mr. Shaw I should be <i>so</i> delighted if I could get along

<!-- page 389 -->

without servants&mdash;they are <i>such</i> a plague! but situated
as we are, it would be utterly impossible. The girls
are very industrious&mdash;I've instructed them in that respect&mdash;but
they are away so much; our relatives in
the city insist upon having one of them there most of
the time; and my health is <i>so</i> precarious that I can
do very little. And then, when the girls <i>are</i> at home,
they are necessarily so much occupied with their company
and music. <i>Your</i> daughters are not musicians,
I believe, Mrs. More?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;they have never shown any fondness for
music&mdash;at least no decided talent for it; and their
father thought it would be a useless expense to have
them take lessons."</p>

<p>"It would <i>so</i>, Mrs. More&mdash;Mr. Shaw and myself
would never have thought of such a thing as having
Angeleen and Serapheen learn music, if they had not
shown such an extraordinary talent for it, from their
very infancy. It's utter nonsense for children to
study any thing they haven't a taste for, especially
music. I think you acted very judiciously."</p>

<p>"Have you heard from Angeleen, lately?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Caroline&mdash;I had a letter from her yesterday.
She is passing her time very pleasantly at her uncle's&mdash;but
she says she <i>does</i> want to see her pa and ma and
sis, and you and Charlotte very much indeed. She
says, 'give my love to all the girls, but <i>particularly</i> to
Caroline and Charlotte More.'  Angel <i>does</i> think <i>so</i>

<!-- page 390 -->

much of her friends&mdash;especially your two girls. Seeing
you making a sleeve, Charlotte, reminds me that
she speaks of the fashions. She says they're wearing
that kind of sleeve now very much. Who cuts your
dresses, Lotty? they always fit beautifully."</p>

<p>"We cut them ourselves."</p>

<p>"My stars! you amaze me! why Mrs. More, I wonder
if there's <i>any thing</i> under the sun that your girls
<i>can't</i> do."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;they can't play on the piano. I had them
learn to cut and fit of Miss Curtis, before she went
away&mdash;and ever since they have made all our dresses."</p>

<p>"My stars! If that isn't a grand idea. You are
such a capital manager, Mrs. More. Mr. Shaw often
remarks that Dr. More's family is a model for its admirable
management&mdash;and it is <i>so</i>. It seems to me I
should be the happiest woman in the world if I could
be independent of hired girls and mantua-makers. I
tell Mr. Shaw they're the plague of my life. Oh, if
my girls could make their own dresses and have them
fit as exquisitely as Carry's and Lotty's do, I should be
<i>so</i> rejoiced. How dreadfully Mary Barber's dresses
hang on her. By the way, Mrs. More, did you know
that old Mrs. Barber is quite sick?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she's been sick some time."</p>

<p>"Is Dr. More her physician?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;they employ Dr. Smith, I beheve."</p>

<p>"My stars! you amaze me, Mrs. More! that miserable

<!-- page 391 -->

hom&oelig;opathist! Astonishing that people will be
such fools! to think of their trusting her in his hands,
when there's such a skillful physician as Dr. More
close by; why I haven't the least confidence in that
kind of practice&mdash;and Dr. More enjoys such a reputation
too! Mr. Shaw says that if Dr. Billings hadn't
been our family physician before Dr. More came here,
he should certainly have employed Dr. More. However,
Mrs. More, between you and me, I presume Dr.
More has escaped an undesirable job. I should think
old Mrs. Barber would be an excessively disagreeable
patient. She is so <i>very</i> repulsive when she's well.
Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know; she's rather reserved&mdash;though
I like her."</p>

<p>"Reserved! my stars! she's as cold as an icicle&mdash;I
don't see how you <i>can</i> like her, especially when she
has treated Dr. More so shabbily."</p>

<p>"I <i>did</i> feel rather hurt that they discharged Dr.
More; but they were urged by some of their friends
to try the hom&oelig;opathic system. It's not from any
want of confidence in Dr. More&mdash;they are very friendly
to him&mdash;and I dare say they'll employ him again,
at some future time, if they're not satisfied with Dr.
Smith's practice."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope that Dr. More will decline attending
them; he certainly ought to do so. I went in there
this morning from a sense of duty. I never call upon

<!-- page 392 -->

any but my particular friends, except in case of sickness;
and the Barbers are such a queer family. I
never know what to make of them. But I <i>must</i> go;
I always stay so long when I come here. I tell Mr.
Shaw I never know when to get away from Dr.
More's. I <i>do</i> think so much of your family. Now
do come round Mrs. More; you <i>never</i> come&mdash;and the
girls are not sociable at all; do come. Seraph and I
are so lonely, etc. etc."&mdash;(Imagine the rest).</p>

<p>She next proceeds to Dr. Smith's.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mrs. Smith."</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mrs. Shaw; you look fatigued;
take the rocking-chair&mdash;do."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Smith, I will, for I am quite
weary; have made several calls this morning; calls
are an awful bore to me in my state of health, except
when I go to see my particular friends."</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;is your health not good, Mrs. Shaw?"</p>

<p>"It's miserable, Mrs. Smith&mdash;miserable. I really
ought to be at home and in bed now, but I told Mr.
Shaw that the morning was <i>so</i> fine, I must get round
and see Mrs. Smith. I've so long been wishing to
come. Mr. Shaw thought I was rather imprudent to
walk so far; but I told him I would stop and rest
several times on the way. I wouldn't attempt to take
such a walk except to see a very <i>particular friend</i>,
which I hope I may call you, Mrs. Smith."</p>

<!-- page 393 -->

<p>"Certainly, Mrs. Shaw&mdash;you do me much honor.
I hope you will not be the worse for the exertion.
Have you been long an invalid?"</p>

<p>"I have <i>so</i>; my health has been very precarious
for some years. O, Mrs. Smith, you can not imagine
how excessively tired I've become of taking such
quantities of medicine as the old-fashioned doctors
give. I tell Mr. Shaw the very sight of it disgusts me."</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"I've heard <i>so</i> much of Dr. Smith's astonishing
success in his practice, that I shouldn't hesitate a moment
to place myself under his care, and go through
a course of hom&oelig;opathic treatment, if it were not for
fear of offending old Dr. Billings, who has always
been our family physician; and we are fearful he
might feel hurt, you know."</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;but I do not think he would be. Dr. Smith
has one of Dr. <i>More's</i> patients, Mrs. Barber, under his
care; and Dr. More doesn't appear to be at all displeased
about it."</p>

<p>"I think you're mistaken, Mrs. Smith, for I've
heard Mrs. More speak of it with considerable bitterness.
She said <i>her</i> feelings were very much hurt at
the Barbers' discharging her husband. Though she
remarked that she felt confident they would become
dissatisfied with Dr. Smith, and send for Dr. More
again."</p>

<p>"Well, I declare! I'll tell the doctor of that&mdash;it's

<!-- page 394 -->

the first time I've heard of any one's speaking
against my husband's practice."</p>

<p>"You know, Mrs. Smith, Dr. More is a very penurious
man, and of course would not like to have a rich
patient slip through his fingers."</p>

<p>"Is he a <i>close</i> man? I didn't know it before."</p>

<p>"He is <i>so</i>&mdash;are you acquainted with the family?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;Mrs. More has never called on me."</p>

<p>"Well, that's not strange&mdash;it <i>costs</i> something you
know to keep up an acquaintance."</p>

<p>"I thought they were quite a genteel family."</p>

<p>"Genteel!&mdash;my stars! they are excessively plain."</p>

<p>"I'm sure the daughters dress in good style."</p>

<p>"I'm aware of that, Mrs. Smith; but they pinch
and save in every other way."</p>

<p>"Sure!&mdash;how you talk!"</p>

<p>"They keep no servants at all, though Dr. More is
abundantly able; there are few richer men in Greenville.
Mrs. More works like a slave&mdash;and so do the
girls."</p>

<p>"Sure!&mdash;how you talk, Mrs. Shaw!"</p>

<p>"I tell Mr. Shaw I do really pity those poor girls;
notwithstanding the doctors' ample means, he has
never given them the advantage of a genteel education."</p>

<p>"Sure! You don't say so, Mrs. Shaw!"</p>

<p>"Just <i>so</i>, Mrs. Smith&mdash;they've not even learnt
music!"</p>

<!-- page 395 -->

<p>"Mercy on us!"</p>

<p>"But they've taken lessons in&mdash;&mdash;, what do you
think?&mdash;just <i>guess</i>, Mrs. Smith."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure I can't tell&mdash;is it drawing?"</p>

<p>"Drawing! My stars! You'd never guess till
your dying day&mdash;dress-making!!"</p>

<p>"Mercy on us! he, he, he, he, he! how Ann Eliza
would laugh to hear that. It's the last thing I ever
should have thought of."</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Shaw says he'd do anything in the
world before he'd let me and the girls work as they
do. He says if it took his last sixpence, Angel and
Seraph should learn music."</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;I shouldn't think Ann Eliza fit for genteel
society, unless she could play on the piano&mdash;how I
<i>should</i> feel if her pa should want her to make her own
dresses."</p>

<p>"You would <i>so</i>, Mrs. Smith&mdash;it's the only <i>accomplishment</i>
that the More's possess; and no wonder they
carry it to such <i>perfection</i>, and pinch up their waists to
the size of a chair-post. Did you ever see such sights
as their waists?"</p>

<p>"They are very small, indeed."</p>

<p>"They look perfectly ridiculous&mdash;Mr. Shaw can't
bear such forms; he says a little waist is a deformity
rather than a beauty."</p>

<p>"I think so too. I've never let Ann Eliza lace
tight."</p>

<!-- page 396 -->

<p>"Well, you have acted very judiciously, Mrs.
Smith; how is Ann Eliza?"</p>

<p>"She's quite well, thank you. She's gone out this
morning to make calls."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope she'll go round to our house.
Seraph would be <i>so</i> delighted to see her&mdash;Ann Eliza's
a lovely girl. I'm told she was a great belle at Coonville."</p>

<p>"Well, it's not for me to say as to that."</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;but you can't help being proud of her,
Mrs. Smith. How sweetly she looked last Sabbath
day! Mr. Shaw remarked it. He admires her style
of beauty excessively. I observed she had on one of
the new-fashioned capes. Angeleen writes me that
they're very much worn by the <i>first</i> in New York."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Ann Eliza heard they were very fashionable
among genteel people. Have you heard from
Angeleen, lately?"</p>

<p>"Received a letter yesterday&mdash;she's very happy;
says she's engaged in one constant round of parties
and swearees&mdash;just what Angel likes, you know;
she's <i>so</i> fond of society. She says, give my love to
all the girls, but particularly to Ann Eliza Smith.
She <i>does</i> love Ann Eliza. But I <i>must</i> go."</p>

<p>"Don't be in haste, Mrs. Shaw."</p>

<p>"O, I've staid a long time. I always <i>do</i> stay forever
when I come here. Now do come round Mrs.
Smith&mdash;run in at any time&mdash;don't be ceremonious.

<!-- page 397 -->

I never use any ceremony with my particular friends.
Tell Ann Eliza to come round, etc. etc."</p>

<p>Her next call is at Mr. Price's, the minister.</p>

<p>"How <i>do</i> you <i>do</i>, Mrs. Price?"</p>

<p>"Quite well, thank you&mdash;how are you, Mrs. Shaw?"</p>

<p>"Poorly, Mrs. Price&mdash;quite poorly."</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry to hear it."</p>

<p>"Really, Mrs. Price, I must take you to task for not
coming round to see me this long time. You've not
done your duty as a minister's wife."</p>

<p>"I've not been able to go, Mrs. Shaw. Gustus has
been sick with the measels, and I've not been out at
all for three weeks."</p>

<p>"My stars! how you shock me, Mrs. Price. I haven't
heard a word of Augustus being sick, or I should
certainly have been round; I always go to see the
sick if I am able to crawl&mdash;but my health is so precarious
that I very seldom get out. I told Mr. Shaw the
morning was <i>so</i> fine I <i>must</i> get out and see my minister's
folks, though it's a very long walk for me. How
is dear little Gusty now?"</p>

<p>"Much better&mdash;so as to be able to go to school to-day."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad&mdash;very indeed. Augustus is such a
noble boy&mdash;Mr. Shaw says he is without exception the
finest child he ever saw. What a mercy that the
Lord saw fit to spare him!</p>

<p>"It was, indeed&mdash;I feel to be thankful."</p>

<!-- page 398 -->

<p>"Is Mr. Price at home?"</p>

<p>"He is. I'll speak to him."</p>

<p>"Now don't disturb him, Mrs. Price, if he's engaged;
but his conversation is <i>so</i> instructive I would
like excessively to see him."</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Price, I hope you're well&mdash;quite well?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly so, Sister Shaw. I trust you are in the
enjoyment of more comfortable corporeal health than
has recently fallen to your lot?"</p>

<p>"I regret that I am not, Mr. Price&mdash;my health is
very delicate&mdash;I assure you, it was a great exertion
for me to walk so far this morning. I told Mr. Shaw
I wouldn't have thought of going such a distance to
see any one but you and Mrs. Price."</p>

<p>"Y-e-s&mdash;I assure you Sister Shaw, I appreciate the
effort, and am truly gratified to see you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Price, it does me <i>so</i> much good to
talk with you occasionally."</p>

<p>"Y-e-s&mdash;well, how do you f-e-e-l now, Sister Shaw,
in regard to your mind?"</p>

<p>"O, Mr. Price, I can not say that I always feel as I
ought to&mdash;owing to the precarious state of my health,
my feelings are variable."</p>

<p>"Y-e-s&mdash;quite natural they should be so."</p>

<p>"Sometimes I feel a degree of coldness and apathy,
and am almost tempted to give up my hope; and again
I experience great comfort, and my evidences of acceptance
are very strong."</p>

<!-- page 399 -->

<p>"Y-e-s&mdash;as a general thing, you enjoy religion, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"I do <i>so</i>&mdash;O, Mr. Price, what should I do without
religion? I tell Mr. Shaw, that with my miserable
health, religion is my only support."</p>

<p>"Y-e-s&mdash;how does Mr. Shaw feel?"</p>

<p>"O, Mr. Price, I regret to say, that he does not feel
his lost and ruined condition as sensibly as I could
wish. O! O! if that man <i>only</i> had saving faith&mdash;and
if Serapheen was <i>only</i> a Christian&mdash;my happiness
would be complete!"</p>

<p>"Y-e-s&mdash;I trust that you wrestle for them, without
ceasing at the throne of grace?"</p>

<p>"I do <i>so</i>, Mr. Price&mdash;I do <i>so</i>."</p>

<p>"Y-e-s&mdash;and do you feel, that in case the Lord
should see fit to disregard your petitions, and consign
them to everlasting misery, you could acquiesce in his
decrees, and rejoice in their destruction?"</p>

<p>"I feel that I could without a murmur."</p>

<p>"Y-e-s&mdash;I am very happy, Sister Shaw, to find you
in such a desirable state of mind."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Price, I feel at times excessively exercised,
in view of the low state of religion in Greenville,
now."</p>

<p>"Y-e-s&mdash;it is truly melancholy, the ways of Zion
languish."</p>

<p>"They do <i>so</i>&mdash;it's time we had another protracted
meeting. I don't know when I've had my feelings so

<!-- page 400 -->

tried as they have been this morning, to see the coldness
and worldliness of some of our people. On my
way here, I stopped to rest at several places&mdash;and O,
my dear Mr. Price! it was so distressing to witness
the unconcern that was manifested."</p>

<p>"Y-e-s."</p>

<p>"I called at Mrs. Barber's&mdash;they're very irreligious
people you know."</p>

<p>"Y-e-s&mdash;no experimental acquaintance with saving
faith."</p>

<p>"None whatever. The old lady's quite sick&mdash;on
her death-bed, perhaps&mdash;I didn't see her&mdash;they didn't
ask me to go in&mdash;you know they're very peculiar
people&mdash;so distant. I <i>did</i> want to see her, and find
out how she <i>felt</i>&mdash;and whether she expected to get to
heaven on good works now. You know you used to
think she did."</p>

<p>"Y-e-s&mdash;I had reason to suppose so, from her conduct."</p>

<p>"It would be dreadful, if the old lady should die in
such a state of mind&mdash;wouldn't it, Mr. Price?"</p>

<p>"Y-e-s&mdash;</p>

<p>'Behold the aged sinner goes,<br/>

Laden with guilt and heavy woes,<br/>

Down <i>to</i> the regions <i>of</i> the dead<br/>

With endless curses <i>on</i> her head.'</p>

<p>How remarkably those words of the sacred poet apply
to her case!"</p>

<p>"They do <i>so</i>. I didn't see Mrs. George Barber neither.

<!-- page 401 -->

She was with the old lady&mdash;but I saw Mary&mdash;what
a hardened girl she is! Why, Mr. Price, she
actually called on the name of the adversary of souls
in the course of her conversation. I <i>never</i> was so
shocked!"</p>

<p>"Dreadful! awfully dreadful, Sister Shaw!"</p>

<p>"And the Mores, too&mdash;I was in there&mdash;how excessively
worldly they are&mdash;think of nothing but making
and saving money&mdash;and what <i>is</i> money good for?
nothing&mdash;just nothing, Mr. Price&mdash;it's the root of all
evil, Mr. Price."</p>

<p>"Y-e-s&mdash;y-e-s."</p>

<p>Though poor Mr. Price thought in his heart that a
little of that same root wouldn't come amiss to him.</p>

<p>"And Dr. Smith's people&mdash;I called there, too&mdash;what
a poor, silly woman, Mrs. Smith is&mdash;entirely devoted
to the world and its follies. She thinks more
of having her daughter shine in society, than she does
of saving her soul, I <i>do</i> believe. O, Mr. Price, I was
sick at heart&mdash;I could have wept as I sat there, and
heard that woman run on about her daughter being a
belle, and dressing in style and all that. Poor Ann
Eliza! she has no parent to wrestle for her at the
throne of grace, as my dear Serepheen has! I do feel
for her&mdash;no wonder that she's such a trifling thoughtless
thing."</p>

<p>"Y-e-s&mdash;it is truly melancholy to be in her condition."</p>

<!-- page 402 -->

<p>"O, there's an alarming state of things in Greenville
now, Mr. Price&mdash;we must have a protracted meeting,
Mr. Price."</p>

<p>"Y-e-s, Sister Shaw, we must endeavor to do so."</p>

<p>"I feel as if <i>something</i> must be done for impenitent
sinners in Greenville. It's three years since we had a
special effort&mdash;'twas before you came here, Mr. Price&mdash;there
was a great outpouring of the Spirit&mdash;Angeleen
experienced religion&mdash;and I feel to believe, that if
we could have another, Mr. Shaw and Serapheen
would come out. And then a great many of those
that were hopefully converted at the last meeting, have
gone back into the world, and want to be re-converted.
We must get up a revival, Mr. Price. Don't you
think so?"</p>

<p>"Y-e-s, I feel convinced that a protracted effort might
be signally blest if the church would come up to the
work. Speaking of your absent daughter, Sister Shaw
have you heard from her lately?"</p>

<p>"I have <i>so</i>&mdash;received a letter yesterday. She desired
to be particularly remembered to her dear friends,
Mr. and Mrs. Price."</p>

<p>"Y-e-s, thank you&mdash;did she say what was the state
of religion in New York now?"</p>

<p>"Very low, she says&mdash;very low, indeed. She attends
Dr. Kittles' church with her uncle's family; but
she says she <i>does</i> want to hear one of your excellent,
spiritual sermons again, Mr. Price. She's heartily

<!-- page 403 -->

sick of the gayety of the city. She's obliged to mingle
in it some, you know; but such things are very
uncongenial to Angel's taste. She <i>does</i> long to come
home to her old friends, and sit under her dear Mr.
Price's preaching once more. Angel is very much attached
to you and Mrs. Price, and so fond of retirement.
'Ma,' she says in her letter, 'I'm utterly worn
out with visits, parties, and swearees.' "</p>

<p>"Swearees! I trust those are not, as the name imports,
profane assemblages."</p>

<p>"By no means, Mr. Price, 'Swearees' is the French
for 'ice-cream parties;' but I <i>must</i> go&mdash;my visits here
are <i>so</i> refreshing. I always stay longer than I intend
to. What an intensely interesting sermon you gave us
last Sabbath day, Mr. Price it did me <i>so</i> much good.
Mr. Shaw was excessively delighted with it&mdash;'<i>that's</i>
what I call preaching,' said he to me, as we were going
home. O, Mr. Price, it is <i>such</i> a deprivation to me
not to be able to attend the evening prayer-meeting
oftener, but my health is <i>so</i> precarious that I can not
do as inclination prompts; but I <i>feel</i> that such deprivations
are sent as trials to my faith."</p>

<p>"Y-e-s, undoubtedly. Sister Shaw&mdash;and I trust that
your faith will be strengthened by them."</p>

<p>"I do most <i>ardently</i> hope so&mdash;but I <i>must</i> go&mdash;now
<i>do</i> come round, Mr. Price, and you, Mrs. Price, I think
<i>so</i> much of having you come."</p>
