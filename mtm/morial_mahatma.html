<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Morning</span> on the mountain tops! The sun had just
risen over the snow-crowned peaks, sending a strong
glow of warmth through the biting air into the sheltered
valleys protected from the cruel northern winds.
The lofty summits of the great range of everlasting
hills gleamed brilliantly against the dark blue sky.
But below the glittering line of the snow mantle all
was dark and terrible; dreadful precipices and deep
ravines broke up the rugged surfaces, and no verdure
existed to soften the gloom. The solitude and sense
of stillness in these mountains is something beyond

<!-- page 6 -->

expression. Mortal man has never trodden these
desolate crests nor even essayed to climb to the verge
of the snow.</p>

<p>They are impassable to the native mountaineers,
and the wild goats, and the yak can find no foothold
on them. These mountains, so awful in their grandeur,
so appalling in their solitude, are the mysterious
and wondrous Koiran chain, which stands in the
centre of Tibet.</p>

<p>All that the Western world, the world of civilisation,
as it is termed, knows of them is that their glittering
peaks can be seen from the summit of Mount
Kambala. But even to the most daring traveller who
has had the courage to attempt the passage of the
Himalayas, the grand range of the Koiran remains
a mystery and a marvel.</p>

<p>They are inaccessible. The "old ice," as the Tibetans
call the perpetual snow, which makes them so
beautiful in the brilliant morning sunshine, will never
gladden the heart of man or beast in the summer
heats, for neither can ever reach it.</p>

<p>The morning sun may kiss the frozen heights, but
fails to warm even the crust of the ice cap. Only

<!-- page 7 -->

the clouds may rest on the bosom of these grim sentinels.
Alone with the storm and mist, the majesty
of the heavens, and the roar of the elements, they
guard for ever the heart of that land of wonders and
romance which we call Tibet.</p>

<p>A perfect fastness is this strange spot around which
roam the great peoples and hordes of Asia. Was it
so preserved when the world was created, that the
Great Unknown might have a natural temple in which
to dwell when He deigned to visit the earth? Who
can say?</p>

<p>It was a May morning&mdash;which means, that here
in Tibet, it was the height of summer. The sun had
indeed extraordinary strength, and threw an almost
tropical heat into the sheltered valleys. There were
but few of these where the soil would admit of the
sun's kindliness being rewarded by greenness or
colour. There was one such spot, however, which
seemed especially favoured.</p>

<p>Completely walled in from the world by these giant
mountains, and right in their very heart, a gleaming
oasis shone out as the sun poured its warmth and
brilliance straight upon it.</p>

<!-- page 8 -->

<p>A beautiful stream fell into this lovely valley and
gathered in the centre into a broad lake.</p>

<p>Here were the only trees to be seen in all that terrible
mountain land. Here, too, were rich grass,
flowering shrubs, and waving fields of grain.</p>

<p>On the lake numbers of beautiful wild fowl revelled
in the sunshine. Flowers bloomed on every side, filling
the air with sweetest perfumes. Not even the
happy valley of Rasselas, filled with delights, could
compare, for gorgeous beauty, harmony of colour
wealth of glory, with this wondrous oasis. It was
like a vision of heaven, a dream of paradise, shut in
among the awful hills!</p>

<p>Until the sun was high in the sky it seemed as
though this exquisite spot, hidden and sheltered by the
stern and gloomy peaks which surrounded it, was uninhabited
save by the birds of the air. But the sun soon
drew forth the lizards to bask in its warmth, and the
noonday hour drew forth also the one solitary human
creature within it whose home was here guarded by
the great mountains from the intrusion of the curious,
ignorant world.</p>

<p>The tallest cluster of trees&mdash;most of them flowering,

<!-- page 9 -->

and grouped so beautifully together that their appearance
was as of a bouquet cast upon the black
mountain side&mdash;surrounded and concealed a dwelling.
When the sun was hot a man stepped out from the
flower-wreathed doorway, and lifting his face towards
the day god, took with delight a deep inspiration of
the keen pure mountain air, snow-sweetened and
scent-laden.</p>

<p>What a face! Was it that this sunshine, this air,
could create such marvellous beauty?</p>

<p>A man of the stature and appearance of other men,
shaped like the toiling millions; yet how different!
It scarcely seemed as if he could be of the race of
mankind, this superbly beautiful being. Standing in
the sunshine, glorious as Apollo, he completed the
perfect charm of this lovely scene. The summit of
creation&mdash;the human flower, seemingly fresh from the
hands of Divinity&mdash;had appeared amidst the flowers
of nature.</p>

<p>A man in strength and vigour, his face had yet all
the fresh beauty of youth. Only a light fair down
lay over the exquisite curve of his mouth; the dark
blue eyes he lifted to the sunshine were calm and

<!-- page 10 -->

untroubled, like a boy's. There was majesty and
power in his bearing, such as is vouchsafed only to
those who are above the common herd of men that
are born and die, and leave no trace of their lives but
a few bones and a handful of earth.</p>

<p>The glorious panorama stretched before him gave
the keen pleasure of contrast to his gaze, for the hours
of darkness, and even of the early morning, had been
spent by this wondrous mortal in strange, unhallowed
studies, and tasks that men speak of only with
bated breath.</p>

<p>Awe-inspiring and marvellous as the great barrier
that surrounded him, was he who stands revealed to
our gaze, unknown and inaccessible as the innermost
recess of the Koiran range, was this solitary man,
magician, and seer, <span class="smcap">Morial, The Mahatma</span>.</p>

<p>A smile of intense pleasure illumined his face, as
he passed out on to the grass. Each summer morning,
and each moment of it, was as a fresh revelation
of enjoyment to him. A happy hour in this transparent
air had the fulness of an eternity to this man;
so great was his capacity for pleasure that every
second had its keen sensation. Magic arts were his

<!-- page 11 -->

at command; from afar off he controlled the feelings
of many disciples, to his will even whole nations
were subjected, he was as destiny to those who came
under his sway. For him the secrets of nature, the
mysteries of life, had been unlocked.</p>

<p>He had lived through centuries, through &aelig;ons,
accumulating pleasure, learning to intensify the joy
of existence!</p>

<p>He moved across the grass, and as he passed from
the door, a panther which had been crouching behind
him, rose and followed him with stealthy step.
This creature never left Morial's side save when he
entered his laboratory, and then it lay, motionless,
across the doorway.</p>

<p>He went down to the side of the water and called
to the fowl, who came flying to him from far across
it, as soon as they heard his voice. They fluttered
about him, and he smiled with pleasure as he watched
their beautiful movements.</p>

<p>A dark blue robe, made of the exquisitely fine cloth
woven from the soft wool of the Tibetan sheep, enfolded
his person. It was a simple gown, much like
the coat worn by an Indian rajah, and was only remarkable

<!-- page 12 -->

for the extreme fineness of its texture. His head
was uncovered, and the sun's rays turned his hair
into a halo of gold. Standing here among his favourite
birds, he might have been mistaken, with
his marvellous beauty for a faun or a pagan deity.</p>

<p>Suddenly there sounded a faint cry&mdash;a cry as of
a human voice, but very far off&mdash;from among the
mountains. Morial scattered the birds from him
with a gesture, and they flew away over the water
as if obeying his wish. He stood still and listened.
Again it came&mdash;more clearly:</p>

<p>"Master!"</p>

<p>Morial turned in the direction whence the sound
proceeded, and raised his right hand with a movement
of command. As he did so, a gradual change
came over him&mdash;his face grew set and stern, and the
beautiful smile left it&mdash;he seemed to increase in
stature.</p>

<p>Presently from out of a thicket of flowering trees,
a being appeared&mdash;a strange figure, in this morning
sunshine, muffled from head to foot in a black garment,
the face entirely hidden in the sable folds; only
the bare feet could be seen, as it advanced timidly,

<!-- page 13 -->

like one blindfolded does, towards the Master.</p>

<p>"What is it, my disciple?" said Morial, and at the
sound of his voice the figure fell upon the ground and
lay prostrate before him.</p>

<p>"Speak!" said the Master, holding out his hand.
Was the face so closely veiled to shield it from the
rays of the brilliant sun, or from the much more terrible
brilliance of the master's presence? For now,
while he used his power, his eyes were like fire; and
from the golden hair that crowned his head something
rose upwards, vivid even in the strong sunlight,
like a flame.</p>

<p>"He is lost, Master, lost in the pass of Phari! His
strength has failed him."</p>

<p>"This is your fault!"</p>

<p>"I have failed, Master. The servants of the Llama
Lishnoo have seized me, and I am helpless&mdash;they
have taken me into the great Lamasery. They think
me dead. Oh, Master, save me!"</p>

<p>"Save you!" said Morial. "You are a useless
servant."</p>

<p>He spoke quite without anger, but there was no
mercy in his voice. How should there be? He felt

<!-- page 14 -->

that the Great Unseen Hand&mdash;the hand of God&mdash;was
opposing him. In such a warfare, a mere soldier
of the ranks was readily forgotten.</p>

<p>He turned away, passing his right hand across his
brow as he did so. Instantly the normal appearance
of his face returned&mdash;the smile of pleasure came upon
his eyes and mouth again. He moved towards the
house, without another glance at the dark figure.</p>

<p>Motionless, it lay upon the grass, like a dead thing.
And yet! before he had gone many paces it had
vanished; there was nothing there. The dark blot
on the beauty of the sunshine and the verdure was
wiped out more easily than a spot of ink on a painted
canvas.</p>

<p>Turning at the doorway, Morial lifted his hand as
if with a gesture of farewell to the beautiful scene he
left; and for one moment the smile in his eyes, blue
with the dark blueness of the Tibetan sky he gazed
at, deepened into laughter.</p>

<p>"Now to work! and the surrender of sweet pleasure
for the moment. I have conquered through the
ages&mdash;I shall conquer to the end."</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 15 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER II.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> he entered the doorway of the house it was
as though the whole world had changed&mdash;as though
he had passed from one planet to another. There
were two entrances to this dwelling, and he returned
by that through which he had emerged, which was
quite contrary to his wonted custom. But he had unexpected
work to do; he had to repair the failure of
a servant and see that that erring servant's work was
properly done, therefore he returned to his laboratory.</p>

<p>The panther crouched down at the entrance, instinctively.</p>

<p>How dark! how cold! how silent! Was the
world dead, and the sun's light quenched in the
heavens?</p>

<p>Morial threw aside the blue robe, and put on in its
place a white garment, most exquisitely embroidered
with figures which seemed to change as he moved.</p>

<!-- page 16 -->

<p>He pushed aside a heavy curtain and entered the
inner chamber of the laboratory. He only glanced
round. His night's work was finished, and he had
no need to enter here for some hours to come. He
paused to give one look at a vast map of the world
which covered a whole wall. This map was a living
thing&mdash;a conscious phonograph&mdash;and disclosed
to him who could command it the movements and
actions of the nations and of the men who led them.
Morial's passing scrutiny was merely to see if any
change had occurred since he had left his vigil. But,
no!&mdash;there was nothing to attract his attention.</p>

<p>He went on, past some more heavy curtains, and
through a massive doorway. And now, indeed, it
seemed as though he had entered the arctic regions!
The stillness was awful; the cold intense. But these
things did not trouble Morial, who had the power of
putting aside external sensations at his will, and was
able to adapt his own temperature to that in which
he found himself.</p>

<p>The room he entered was hewn out of the living
rock; long, narrow, perfectly dark. A lighted taper
in a crevice of the wall at the entrance was all the

<!-- page 17 -->

light admitted. He advanced until he came into the
complete darkness, which fell like a pall, so deep
was it.</p>

<p>But something was now alight&mdash;an irradiated
light!&mdash;a light not of the earth. A gleam came from
it, like moonlight&mdash;cold and white.</p>

<p>It was a huge crystal, hung from the roof of the
great room.</p>

<p>In its heart was the mystic gleam which can be
seen only in earthly darkness, and which shines but
for the eye of the initiated.</p>

<p>Morial stood before it, and gazing into its depths
he stretched out his right hand towards it. As he
did so, the red gold hair upon his head again seemed
to lift itself. But now, in the darkness, it could be
seen as living flame.</p>

<p>The light of the crystal clouded and grew dim.
Still Morial gazed; and soon the cloud parted and
slowly cleared. Then, with all the sharpness of
a photograph, a scene appeared before his eyes.</p>

<p>The side of a vast, snow-clad mountain, the summit
just visible, and along this summit a row of small
flags, fluttering in the wind, fixed roughly, but firmly

<!-- page 18 -->

enough, in rude cairns of stone. Morial knew these
to mark the boundary line between Hindostan and
Tibet. A long way down the dreary face of the
dark mountain Sumunang was a ravine, filling rapidly
with drifting snow. In this cold grave he could
discern a man, wrapped in a travelling cloak, and
seemingly dead. Morial knew him not to be dead.
He was fast bound in the sleep of fatigue and of
cold, known only too well to the daring traveller
who attempts to pass the Himalayas.</p>

<p>"My feeble disciple!" murmured Morial, as he
looked at this scene, "you must not be lost to me
so readily. I have work for you to do. You, who
have almost penetrated into the fastnesses of Tibet,
shall not die within sight of the flags. No, I need
you. You are now in the pass of Phari: you shall
be brought in safety to the other side of it."</p>

<p>He waved his hand, and immediately the crystal
clouded. Presently, the clouds parted again, and
there was revealed another part of the same dreadful
pass. A great company of pilgrims was collected
here, resting in the snow. They were worn out with
fatigue, and all half asleep; but with their cloaks

<!-- page 19 -->

and camping fire were able to retain life. These,
as Morial knew, were pilgrims from the borders
of Hindostan to the shrine of Kiangtsi, within the
borders of Tibet. He scrutinised their faces a moment
or two, and then raised his hand and made a
sudden movement towards one of them. Instantly
this sleeper sprang up and began to cry out and
declaim. In a moment he was surrounded by others,
who listened to him in amazement. He issued words
of command, and his comrades hurriedly prepared
to obey him, for they were devout believers in the
divine afflatus.</p>

<p>Soon a small band set forth through the snow, led
by the inspired speaker, who hurried on, surmounting
every difficulty with incredible strength. At last
he stood still and shouted with excitement, pointing,
as he did so, to the ravine below, where in the snow
lay the figure he had been shown in his vision&mdash;the
prostrate figure of the man he had been commanded
to save.</p>

<p>The traveller was drawn forth from the snow, and
carried back to the heat of the fire, and revived by
such rude methods as the pilgrims could devise. No

<!-- page 20 -->

word could be interchanged, even when the frozen
traveller had recovered his senses, for Julian Arundel
knew nothing of Hindustani, which was the only
language these men had ever heard of. But he knew
that these wild-looking creatures had saved his life;
saved it by so much of a miracle, that his faith returned
as he thought of it, and he believed again, not
only that Mahatma Morial existed, but that he himself
was destined to find him. This faith had deserted
him more than once during his terrible journey; and
when at length his strength gave way in climbing
that awful pass of Phari, he had given up all hope.</p>

<p>Morial remained standing by the crystal until again
the clouds veiled its light, and then he left the dark
room in which it hung. He passed straight through
his laboratory without a glance around; and putting
on once more the blue robe, he went quickly out into
the glorious sunshine.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 21 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER III.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> scene which he had just witnessed as a vision
was real enough to its unfortunate hero.</p>

<p>Julian Arundel, although he had felt himself to be
among friends for the moment, could not guess how
long that friendship might last, or what it would mean.</p>

<p>He did not know enough of the country to recognise
that he had fallen in with a band of pilgrims,
and all kinds of wild conjectures filled his mind, as
soon as he had fully recovered his faculties.</p>

<p>The strange looking creatures by whom he was
surrounded, although they were kind enough in a
rough way, yet evidently considered him their property.
Being unable to speak a word which they
understood, he could only lie by the camp fire and
wonder what was to happen next.</p>

<p>His mind went back to London, to the home and

<!-- page 22 -->

to the life he had left, and all their attractions, and
to her who would have been his wife, ere now, if he
had not followed the mysterious call which came to
him.</p>

<p>Here, lying by the fire under the Tibetan sky, his
far-off home seemed like a dream to him. He
thought of his studio, where now, although he had
quitted it, his last work stood upon an easel, carefully
guarded and screened by a curtain from prying
eyes.</p>

<p>That last work was a portrait of Morial the Mahatma
in all the majestic beauty which we have
seen.</p>

<p>As one does sometimes, in an enforced period of
quiet, Julian Arundel thought over many of the
details of the commencement of his strange pilgrimage.</p>

<p>He recalled that night in his studio when Daphne
had been sitting to him, and he startled her by an
exclamation of surprise, and almost of horror, for,
suddenly, while he was working, he had seen upon
the wall opposite, in letters of fire, the name "Morial."
This had appeared, vanished, and appeared again,

<!-- page 23 -->

and Daphne in her tender anxiety thought he had
been working too hard, and that he was ill.</p>

<p>But the next day before her sitting was over, not
only did the name appear, but the figure of the
Master himself stood in the room. To Julian he was
as real as a human being in the flesh. Daphne saw
and heard nothing, but she was filled with terror for
Julian's health.</p>

<p>However, when this vision had appeared again
and again, at last she also seemed to realise its presence,
and when Julian took a fresh canvas and began
to sketch the figure of the Master, she was overcome
with a sense of its reality.</p>

<p>What a splendid portrait it was that appeared upon
his canvas! It filled his own mind with awe and
wonder as he painted, and Daphne would sit for
hours, watching him at work, lost in a kind of
dream.</p>

<p>Before the picture was finished he had seen written
across it the words, that were to him a sacred
call: "<i>Leave everything and come to me</i>."</p>

<p>Daphne saw this too, only for a moment, and she
could scarcely tell whether it was fancy, so brief

<!-- page 24 -->

was the glimpse! But her mind was overwhelmed
with a sense of the awful reality of the thing, and
when Julian turned to her and said:</p>

<p>"Daphne, this is the great call, I must go," her
answer was simply:</p>

<p>"Yes, you must go."</p>

<p>Daphne Royal was quite alone in the world, save
for a distant relation in whose charge she was now
placed. She was a ward in Chancery, very rich.
Her father's early death left her entirely without any
controlling authority. Julian and she had known
each other since they were children, and she had
always looked to him for guidance as well as love.</p>

<p>She and her auntie, as she called Miss Riga, who
was in reality a second cousin of her dead father,
lived next door to him at Hampstead. The young
people were much together, but Julian had a great
distrust of the old lady, and was well aware that she
did not like him.</p>

<p>This was his one trouble in leaving Daphne so
long and in postponing their marriage. He thought
of it now when he was so far from her.</p>

<p>Miss Riga was, in his opinion, capable of any

<!-- page 25 -->

duplicity for her personal advantage, but Daphne
would never listen to anything against her aunt, for
in her childhood she had learned to look up to her
as to a mother.</p>

<p>Miss Riga felt that when Daphne came of age and
married Julian Arundel her special occupation would
be at an end. Not only was she pleased at the "call,"
but she felt that it would be a good thing to annihilate
Daphne's affections for Julian in his absence.</p>

<p>This was not possible, Julian thought to himself.
Daphne was as true and as certain as the stars above
him. And, moreover, he reminded himself it was
against the conditions of the great call that he should
even think about such a material matter!</p>

<p>Nothing mundane, nothing of earth was to affect
him any longer: he had chosen his path, he had
given up the world, and Daphne in her beautiful
enthusiasm had agreed with him that he should
obey the mysterious power which called him to
service.</p>

<p>Many times on the cruel mountain-side had he
longed to be back in his comfortable studio with
Daphne to cheer him, but he had taken a vow that

<!-- page 26 -->

he would not give way to fatigue or illness, that he
would go on until he had proved to himself whether
the Master existed in the flesh.</p>

<p>Through the most difficult parts of his journey a
guide had been by his side who had helped and befriended
him. This man had sometimes, he declared,
even spoken with the Master himself, and hope beat
high in Julian's heart when the thought came that
perhaps this man was a chosen disciple sent to help
him.</p>

<p>But at the most critical moment, on the very border
of Tibet, at the worst point of this terrible pass, this
guide had apparently deserted him. In his awful
peril and helplessness, when he sank down in the
snowdrift, he had, indeed, cursed the enthusiasm
which had brought him on this apparently hopeless
journey.</p>

<p>But now that he had been saved, as if by a miracle,
now that the night of despair was waning, and a
streak of dawn was showing in the sky, he had again
companions to help him on his way, and the enthusiasm
which had carried him so far rose strongly
within him.</p>

<!-- page 27 -->

<p>Yes! he would despair no more. He would find
the Master now at any cost.</p>

<p>He reckoned without thought of the consequences
to himself when the pilgrims would bring him to the
great Lamasery or Tibetan Monastery at which they
made their next halt. The awful rigours of the Tibetan
laws against the intrusion of strangers were,
however, soon to be demonstrated to him.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 28 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Julian Arundel</span> was a particularly handsome man.
Not above the average stature, but broad-shouldered,
with a magnificent figure, and a head carried with a
certain Lucifer-like pride. No doubt Morial, in choosing
him out of the many highly cultured persons in
London for his peculiar purpose, had recognised the
great physical strength which would survive hardship,
and the pride which would scorn to fail. This
last was an essential of Julian's character. The very
fact that death had so nearly seized him, and so
nearly destroyed his whole scheme and programme,
made him awake in the morning, after a brief sleep,
doubly resolved to persevere in his strange pilgrimage.</p>

<p>The camp fire, made of argols, the sole fuel of the
country, was dying out. The pilgrims had untethered
the miserable, starved horses which had
carried them so far&mdash;carried them usually in manner

<!-- page 29 -->

unknown to Europeans, suspended to their tails. To
hold on to one's horse's tail and let him climb is the
only comparatively easy manner of ascending these
terrible precipices, which are by courtesy called mountain
faces.</p>

<p>Poor Julian had come hither on his own weary
limbs, and he surveyed with envy these travellers
with skeleton beasts of burden. The exhaustion of
the animals was owing to no inclemency of their
masters, but simply to that of the climate, which forbade
the ground to yield them food. For many a
weary day these poor creatures had only eaten grass
so cruelly frozen that its stiffness cut their mouths
and left them bleeding. Splendid horses at one time,
they presented as sorry a spectacle as Julian himself,
who, but a short while ago, a superb specimen of
an Englishman, now looked like a starved mendicant.</p>

<p>His face and hands were literally ploughed with
the cold; his grenadier moustache, erstwhile a pride
to him, was now a torment, each hair being weighted
by an unmeltable icicle. He was clad in strange
garments; a sheep's skin, the wool inwards, next

<!-- page 30 -->

his body; over this a coat made of foxes' skins; and
over all a great woollen overcoat.</p>

<p>It would have been hard indeed to recognise in
this bundle the <i>debonnaire</i> figure which had been the
ornament of Picadilly on many a private view day.
But Julian was no trifler with circumstances; if he
had to face a difficulty or hardship he faced it heroically.
At the same time it is possible that if on this
morning he had foreseen the amount of hardship he
would have to endure, he might even then have
turned back.</p>

<p>This would have been the case with most of us at
the critical moments of our lives, and surely this is
why (if there is a reason) the future is mercifully
concealed from us.</p>

<p>When Julian attempted to rise from his bed of
cloaks, which the pilgrims made for him, he found
that his feet and hands were completely frozen, and
that it was impossible for him to stand, much less to
walk. His lips were livid and his eyes drawn backwards
by the cold, and the pilgrims, who were well
acquainted with the horrors of a frozen death, began
to fear that it was all over with him.</p>

<!-- page 31 -->

<p>The inspired one who had been guided to his rescue
refused to leave him by the wayside as some
of them wished. Urged on by his importunities, a
little body of rescue workers wrapped the unfortunate
disciple of the great Morial in some rough blankets,
and forced him to take a grasp of one of the
horse's tails. In this way he was taken over the actual
summit of the mountain. When they came to the
other side he was placed upon one of the horses.
The descent of the pass of the Phari is much like that
of an enormous staircase, each stair of which seems
very like what a Westerner would call a hill at the
least. The animal which supported Julian appeared
to sink from one vast table to another below it.</p>

<p>He gave himself up for lost, simply clinging on to
the horses body, which had a certain warmth and
friendliness, and awaited his fate. Starvation had
much to do with this apathetic condition of mind.
He had tasted nothing but a little barley meal soaked
with a horrible Tibetan tea for many a long day, and
even that had been denied him for a day and a
night.</p>

<p>When at last the exhausted little company reached

<!-- page 32 -->

what looked like a plain, but what was really a table-land,
and there seemed some chance of an easier
journey for a little while, a new danger presented
itself. In the distance, on the far horizon, were seen
two horsemen. Instantly the entire caravan stopped
by a simultaneous movement of consternation. The
distant horsemen galloped steadily at a furious pace.
The inspired pilgrim, who always remained by the
side of Julian, was hanging his head in an overwhelming
state of abjection. Julian touched him to
attract his attention.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he said, "why are we halting?" but
his attempt at Hindustani was unavailing. The man
could not understand what he said, and his answer
was equally unintelligible. Julian felt he could do
nothing but submit to force of circumstances.</p>

<p>By the time the horsemen had neared them, many
more had appeared on the horizon. This was, as a
matter of fact, a little band of some thirty or thirty-five
in number of the Kolos, the brigands of Tibet. No one
outside Tibet has an idea of the position of these men
in the country. They say themselves that they are
the servants of the Tal&egrave; Lama, and irreconcilable

<!-- page 33 -->

enemies of the Emperor of China, and indeed of all
foreign Powers. This may be true, for they certainly
protect the frontier of Tibet more effectually than any
body of recognised soldiers could. Europeans will,
of course describe them as highwaymen.</p>

<p>Julian's companions appeared to be utterly overcome
with the appearance of these men. It was
probably quite unexpected to them, that, poor as
they were, destitute of everything but faith, they
should attract any attention. Nevertheless, the Kolos
were quite determined to give them a most embarrassing
interview. The reason for this was soon
seen.</p>

<p>Tibet appears to be a wild country, impassable,
and without means of communication. And yet no
European traveller has ever yet entered it, no traveller
has ever passed the little flags, which look
so innocent and trivial on the top of the great mountain,
without these terrible warriors of the desert
immediately arresting them, and condemning them
to either death or imprisonment. What that imprisonment
ends in no European can at present
even conjecture.</p>

<!-- page 34 -->

<p>Julian's arrival had evidently been clearly expected;
all about him, whence he had come was known,
which pass he would enter by, and in what company.
As soon as the two emissaries from the little
band reached the pilgrims, they immediately placed
themselves one on each side of Julian, and then proceeded
to survey him with great interest.</p>

<p>Awaiting the arrival of their companions, they did
not attempt to speak to him, evidently being aware
that there was no possible means of communication.
Julian, in his turn, surveyed his guardians with great
interest and curiosity. They were most terrible-looking
persons, riding animals of a sort which Europeans
are seldom favoured with seeing, even in a
circus. A sheepskin was the only coat worn by these
men, and a scrap of wolfs skin formed their caps,
and long, thick black hair fell over their shoulders, a
carbine was slung in the saddle-bow of each, and
two long sabres stuck in the girdle.</p>

<p>The alarming part, however, of their appearance
was the expression of the eyes, which had something
ferocious and wolfish in them. Julian had enough
of the artist left in him, and enough of the philosopher

<!-- page 35 -->

to be able to look at them and think to himself,
"What would I not give to be back in my own studio
with these gentlemen as my models."</p>

<p>A long colloquy passed between his two guards
and the pilgrims, which terminated on the arrival of
the other Kolos. These men came galloping up in
true circus fashion, careering wildly over the ground
and then drawing up suddenly in a circle, the horses
thrown back on their haunches. In a few moments
the pilgrims had vanished. They appeared to have
melted away like a handful of Himalayan snow taken
to a fireside.</p>

<p>So far as the unlucky Julian was concerned, they
had disappeared as easily as this, and he himself had
an entirely new circle of acquaintances to deal with.
He had been quickly taken off the wretched horse he
was mounted on and placed on what he would himself
have described as a wild beast of the desert,
which belonged to the brigands. They set off at
full speed, and some kind of goad applied to his own
animal kept him in their midst. Presently with the
greatest suddenness, a halt was called by a rough
cry from the leader. Once more every horse was

<!-- page 36 -->

thrown back on its haunches. Julian would certainly
have fallen from his animal, had not the men who
rode by his side been so near and kept him in his
place.</p>

<p>A great change was now made in his position.
He was quietly taken from his horse's back and one
of the warriors untied a long scarf which had been
wound round his waist. This was knotted firmly
round Julian's neck, and by it he was attached to the
horse's tail. Immediately every man mounted and
the party set off again at full speed. After a space of
time, the length of which Julian himself never knew,
he was released from this yoke of torture and left
upon the ground perfectly unconscious.</p>

<p>Many a long year afterwards he looked at the
fragments of the scarf which had bound him, and
which he succeeded in preserving, with utter amazement
at the manner in which his life had been preserved.
Preserved it was, but when first he opened
his eyes his feeling was that death would have been
far preferable under such circumstances. He found
himself lying upon the ground, on the floor of a
species of natural amphitheatre. When first his

<!-- page 37 -->

eyes opened he saw the intense blueness of the
Tibetan sky, a blueness which is almost black, and
magnifies the beauty of the stars at night.</p>

<p>Now the sun was shining in the heavens, although
it did not reach him where he lay, for the shadow of
a great mountain fell across the ground. As he
lowered his gaze he saw the mountain tops one after
another, and then he recognised the awful place where
he had himself been. Yes, that was the pass of
Phari, faraway, looking so remote that it seemed impossible
that human being should ever reach it. But
he had passed it; the little flags were passed, he had
descended the other side of the mountain, and he
was in Tibet.</p>

<p>A wild sense of elation was the first feeling that
arose within him. Before he had time to realize
this, and believe that he was indeed in the secret
country of the world, his sight was clouded, and
the heavens were darkened by a dreadful shape
that floated over him. What was this awful thing?
Was this really not a world of the living, but a world
of the dead? had he reached the uttermost regions,

<!-- page 38 -->

and was this a ghoul sent to close out light and
destroy his life slowly?</p>

<p>He knew that it was a living thing, because he
could see a movement that seemed like wings. But
the creature was close to him, and so horribly dark,
so black, that he could only determine the one fact
that he lived. He longed to shriek, to cry out, but
he could not. He was like a man in a nightmare.
But the thing came closer, the blackness settled on
him. Something seemed to touch his breast, and
then all the vigour of the man asserted itself.</p>

<p>With a wild effort he lifted his head and raised his
arm, and struck the horror from him. What was it?
It floated high into the air, up into the blueness of
the sky. He watched it until it became so small
that he could scarcely see it. Then he lowered his
eyes again and saw around him, in the ghastly theatre
in which he lay, millions of skeletons, and hovering
over them more of those terrible black shapes&mdash;the
great vultures of Tibet.</p>

<p>In an instant he realised that this was a physical
danger, that if he could rise, if he could stand, the
creatures would not come near him. But how could

<!-- page 39 -->

he do this, worn out and exhausted as he was? How
was it that he was surrounded in this way by these
skeletons, these bodies long since stripped of every
particle of flesh? To him it seemed like some awful
dream, like some ordeal given him to see if his
reason would endure it.</p>

<p>It was not until long afterwards when he learned
something of the country, that he knew he had been
simply left as one dead in an ordinary Tibetan burial
ground. This was the burial ground of Phari, which
lies below the pass. A deserted fortress stood on
the other side of it, but Julian could not even know
that there were walls to shelter him. And little use
would these walls have been, for there was neither
food nor fire nor any human company within them.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 40 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER V.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Julian</span> must have swooned right away. He passed
through what was a blissful period of unconsciousness.
When he again woke to life, his first impression
was that he was in the grasp of a fearful skeleton,
nothing more or less than the evil spirit itself
come to claim him. This phantasy which affected
him quickly passed away, and his next impression
was that Daphne was sitting beside him and he was
back again in his old, old room, and that he had
been ill and she nursing him. How sweet it was; it
brought to his troubled heart the sense of peace and
of friendliness of human beings.</p>

<p>He stirred himself to try and take her hand, and in
this effort the dream vanished. No, it was not
Daphne, and his own home and his happiness were
on the other side of the world. He saw himself
again surrounded by the bones of the dead, and the
figure by his side he recognised after a moment of

<!-- page 41 -->

amazed contemplation. This was one of the pilgrims
from whom he had been torn. He did not know the
man except that he recognised him as one who had
walked by his side. It was, in fact, the fanatic, the
inspired speaker, who had risen out of his sleep
before to save him, and who now, still under the
spell of Morial's dominion, had sought him out again
in the graveyard.</p>

<p>This man knew well enough that the stranger was
not dead. If he had found him buried in the earth
he would have dug him out of it. Morial's spell was
strong upon him. He lifted Julian in his arms, and
drawing from inside his coat a little cake of barley,
tried to press some of it upon him. But this was impossible,
for Julian was unable to swallow it. The
pilgrim sighed, but made no further efforts. He put
the cake back very carefully into the capacious bosom
of his coat, which really served him as a larder. As a
matter of fact he had offered to Julian what was really
his own food for the next twenty-four hours, and it is
little wonder that in the midst of hardships he was
not sorry to think that this wretched meal had been
saved for him.</p>

<!-- page 42 -->

<p>After carefully putting away the cake he clasped
Julian in his arms and lifted him to his feet. But for
the iron physique of a strong Englishman, Julian
must have been dead, and the pilgrim evidently
looked upon his power of endurance as something
almost supernatural. By the help of his companion's
arm he turned himself and surveyed the extraordinary
scene in which he found himself placed. The skeleton
of a horse is not a pleasant thing. Anyone who
has travelled a desert has seen it. It gives one a
shock; there is something so ghastly about it. The
skeleton of a human being is twenty times more horrible
when it has no associations with study or science
or the use of medicine, when one sees it stripped by
the carrion of the sky, lying exposed to the elements
in all its horror.</p>

<p>Julian saw this sight on every side of him multiplied
a thousand times, and at last he covered his
eyes with his hands, and said aloud in his own language,
"Take me away from this awful place." He
had forgotten in his horror with whom he was.
Some strange instinct told the pilgrim what the man
said, and placing his arm around him he led him

<!-- page 43 -->

as well as he could across the bone-cumbered valley.</p>

<p>It was a terrible journey for Julian, who dared not
open his eyes, for he felt certain his reason would
desert him if he did. Having crossed the valley they
passed through a narrow ravine, at the bottom of
which a mountain torrent made a deep bed. At the
sound of the water Julian uncovered his eyes and
looked at it with thankfulness as something wholesome,
although its blackness and the depth in which
it moved would have horrified those accustomed to
pastures and a quiet life.</p>

<p>On the side of this, in a sheltered nook a band of
pilgrims was encamped, and once more Julian found
himself amongst those who appeared to be friends.
His appearance caused a great deal of animated conversation,
but he did not concern himself about it.
His rescuer wrapped him in a large sheepskin, and
laid him by the side of a fire of argols, and soon he
fell into a deep, refreshing sleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke, this man who had been his deliverer
brought him (one great luxury of Tibet) a cup of
buttered tea, which Europeans would describe as a
horrible decoction made of tea siftings and flavoured

<!-- page 44 -->

with rancid butter. Soon after he had been refreshed
by this wonderful drink the whole camp started into
motion.</p>

<p>Julian noticed that since his adventure they had
lost some of their animals, and only a few wretched
horses were left to assist them on their way. These,
however, worked willingly enough, as anxious as
the men themselves to get out of the position they
were in. They went on through the ravine and into
a valley where the temperature was milder. There
was a deep lake here, but it was covered with ice;
the supply of fuel being very small the pilgrims did
not dare to stay. They passed on and attempted to
cross the river of the golden sand.</p>

<p>Julian heard this name for it afterwards; at the
time his mind was taken up with the extraordinary
spectacle presented by the surface of the stream. It
was completely frozen, but apparently a series of
islands crossed it, and his first thought was that they
could walk along these islands.</p>

<p>He noted, however, something that attracted a
great deal of attention from his comrades, and when
they came close he was utterly stupefied by the sight

<!-- page 45 -->

which presented itself. The islands were formed
simply by a troop of wild cattle which had attempted
to cross the river at the moment of the concretion of
the waters. They had been frozen into it&mdash;encrusted
in the rapidly-formed ice. Their eyes had been
picked out by birds of prey and much of the flesh
had been taken as well. Their splendid heads, with
their great horns upstanding, were raised up high as
if in protest. Seeing this immediately after the awful
burial ground the sight impressed Julian strangely.
It made him feel how little life was valued in this
mysterious country. He had already suspected that
the Masters looked upon life as valueless, and that
notable service only was what they cared for. He
had been prepared to encounter this, but already he
was face to face with something more dreadful.</p>

<p>The nation, the elements in which it lived, alike
seemed indifferent to cost or loss. The ice was so
strong that it was very easy to walk by the side of
the skeletons of these unfortunate creatures. Although
the pilgrims were now in what seemed like a
valley, as a matter of fact, a very high point of Upper
Asia had been reached, and the cruelty of the north

<!-- page 46 -->

wind was something that no dweller in the West
could realise. Long before Julian had crossed the
river he had forgotten all about those unlucky ones
whose bones he had seen lying in the valley, about
the artistic results he was losing every moment, and,
yet more surprising, about even himself.</p>

<p>All he knew was the simple fact that the cold was
killing him, and his especial friend among the pilgrims,
the one who had twice rescued him from
death, became very excited on observing his symptoms.
He was lifted on to one of the horses' backs,
and a small band of the pilgrims, taking the best of
the horses, went on with him.</p>

<p>The day was far advanced now, and it was impossible
for Julian to appreciate the scenery through
which they had to pass. Vague visions returned to
him in after years of grassy hills where banks were
formed of masses of primrose-coloured flowers. He
heard the great stream rushing far below, he saw in
the distance the rolling mountains which filled the
background.</p>

<p>At the base of the hills which closed this valley
were great spurs of bright sandstone, and in the valley

<!-- page 47 -->

itself piles of stones were capped with flat slabs
of white marble. At the first glance these white tops
had the appearance of English bell tents, and Julian
for a moment half expected to see some dear familiar
red-coats pacing among them. But it was not so
indeed. As a matter of fact, they had arrived at the
great Tibetan Lamasery. Although it appears to be
in a valley it really stands higher than the summit of
Mont Blanc. Though Julian's sight had grown dim
with the fatigue, he observed a pile of stately buildings
arranged as if in imitation of the mountains,
amphitheatrically.</p>

<p>The highest building of all, which was also the
largest, was surmounted by an extraordinary roof,
which in the rays of the now setting sun seemed to
be composed entirely of gold. Julian fancied, however,
that he could detect some figures upon it, and
even in his extreme state of weariness resolved within
himself that he would endeavour to find out what
these were. The detachment of the body of pilgrims
which had made itself into his especial escort, passed
rapidly down the ravine through the valley, along a
path which passed straight across the great valley of

<!-- page 48 -->

barley, and up to the very entrance of the great
Lamasery.</p>

<p>Here Julian got a vision of a number of persons,
tall, severe-looking, with an ominous expression,
dressed in white, with big yellow girdles clasped
about the waist. These men approached him, and in
a few moments he found himself lifted from his horse
by strong arms. In a few moments more all the
horrors of cold, of ice, and of the bitter journey had
disappeared. He was in an interior, a strange one
indeed, but for the moment he was sheltered, he was
warmed, and he was fed. For a little while these
facts were enough for him.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 49 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Riga</span> had been one of the advanced teachers
of the Woman's Rights movement many years before
she took charge of Daphne. Her relationship
with Daphne was a very remote one. She was the
second cousin of Daphne's father, but when poor
Daphne with all her money and with all her beauty
strayed into Chancery, Miss Riga was the nearest
relation to be found who could take charge of her.</p>

<p>It had been a great trouble to her for a long time,
that she had seen and felt Julian's distrust of her.
She saw that when Daphne's majority was attained,
and when Daphne had become his wife, she would
once more herself be at the mercy of the world.
Such a prospect was unsupportable to a woman of
her ambition. Miss Riga in her experience of life
had learned to look upon attractive women as creatures
of another sphere. She had never been loved,
more than that, she had never been liked. She had

<!-- page 50 -->

simply held to her rights as long as she had any,
and after that fought her way. In Daphne's inheritance
and in Daphne's present wealth all her
opportunity now lay.</p>

<p>When Julian left England to obey the mysterious
call, he left Daphne reluctantly enough in charge of
this woman. He could not object to such a guardian,
since Daphne had been guarded by her since childhood.
At the same time it annoyed him because of
his great distrust. But very soon after his departure
both Miss Riga and Daphne were in high spirits.
Or, to speak more correctly, were in a remote kind
of elation. Communications from a far-off world
do not so much raise our spirits as change them.
Daphne's beautiful face and figure seemed to be
petrified into a statue expressive of all wonder and
amazement; while Miss Riga, sitting in her big armchair,
laughed to herself, rapping her hands the
while. She had an odd little trick, this weird old
woman, of rapping the knuckles of her left hand
with the palm of her right when she was delighted
about anything. And she was very delighted now,
for on the very day after Julian had sailed for India

<!-- page 51 -->

Daphne had received an extraordinary communication.
She awoke in the morning with an idea that
someone had been with her, that a paper had been
given her, that something had fluttered over her
head. And when broad awake, sure enough, a paper
lay close to her hand, a morsel of paper torn out of
Julian's favourite manuscript book. Daphne took
the paper to Miss Riga, and asked her what she
thought it meant. Miss Riga looked at it, took off
her glasses, put them on again, reflected, then said:
"My dear, this is in no language known in this part
of the world. It must be a message from Julian's
Master. I suppose it is in Sanscrit. Shall we go to
the British Museum and see if anybody there can
tell us what it means?"</p>

<p>But there was no necessity for them to go to the
Museum. Long before they were ready to start, a
knock at the door announced the arrival of one of
Julian's friends&mdash;a Mr. Gray. Miss Riga, who was
in a great fuss ready to depart (for it always took a
couple of maids to set her in motion), immediately
informed Mr. Gray of the matter in hand. "Well,

<!-- page 52 -->

well," he said, "you need not go to the British
Museum; I can read Sanscrit."</p>

<p>At this the message was shown to him. He looked
at it, he read it, he stroked his beard, a long brown
silky one, and then again he looked at the message
and read it. Then he looked at the ladies, and
said:</p>

<p>"Prepare yourselves."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Miss Riga, "we are ready for anything;
have we not suffered from losing our dear
Julian?"</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said Mr. Gray, "The message
is simply this:&mdash;</p>

<br/>

<p><i>Throw these two houses into one, and make a great
lamasery in London. Obey my orders, and I, the
Master, will visit you and guide you."</i></p>

<p class="right">(<i>signed</i>) <i>MORIAL</i>.</p>

<br/>

<p>The two women looked at each other; Miss Riga
rose from her chair&mdash;she was a very small woman,
very attenuated, with a drawn look peculiar to
some faces when success has not enlivened them.

<!-- page 53 -->

"Daphne," she said, "this is the great moment of
your life and a great moment of mine. We must
obey. Child, what right have we over Julian's
house?"</p>

<p>"None that I know of," said Daphne, "but
if it is an order from his Master, I shall obey it
at any hazard."</p>

<p>Miss Riga, putting the glasses on her face again,
took up the paper with the message written on it
and looked at it very seriously.</p>

<p>"Have you the slightest idea," addressing herself
to Mr. Gray, "what a Lamasery is?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes," said Mr. Gray, hesitating and laughing
at the same time, "it is a monastic establishment
of the Buddhistic religion."</p>

<p>"A monastic establishment!" said Miss Riga;
"are we to found one here?"</p>

<p>"I have no idea," said Mr. Gray; "this matter is
getting altogether beyond me. Do you know, Miss
Royal," he said addressing himself to Daphne,
"that you promised, when Julian was at home,
you would sit for me for the picture of the Tragic
Muse."</p>

<!-- page 54 -->

<p>Daphne roused herself with an effort. "Yes,"
she said, "I remember quite well. Do you really
want me to sit?"</p>

<p>"Should I have ever asked you," he said, "if I
did not?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Gray," said Miss Riga, in an impressive
manner, "these trifles are out of place; Julian,
Daphne and I have all alike been called to a great
life of renunciation. By it we shall pass through the
golden gates of sacrifice into the glorious hereafter,
and every interest and every selfish thought has to
be surrendered; we live now only for our Master's
bidding."</p>

<p>She said this very solemnly. Turning presently
to Daphne she asked in a different tone, "Which
room could we use best to break an archway into
Julian's house?"</p>

<p>Daphne was a little startled by this sudden question
and hesitated a moment. "Well, Auntie, dear,
his studio joins our drawing-room."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," Miss Kirton said; "that will do very
well. What a grand hall it will make if we can throw
the two into one for meetings of the faithful."</p>

<!-- page 55 -->

<p>"What do you mean?" said Daphne, looking at
her in amazement.</p>

<p>"Don't you see?" said Miss Riga, turning suddenly
around. The old lady looked like a witch
now, if ever a woman did. Her black hair,
streaked slightly with grey, was usually thrown
decorously over her temples, but she had pushed it
back in her excitement. Her eyes were of a peculiar
grey-green, and glittered like stars. When she was
excited her shrivelled face and attenuated body appeared
to be mere accessories to this peculiar brilliance
of expression. She fixed her eyes on Daphne,
and the girl's answering gaze was at first full of
steadiness, but afterwards faltered and grew dim.</p>

<p>"Julian would never object to what you do," said
Miss Riga, and "Why of course not," said Mr. Gray,
rising and taking up his hat, "Julian is much too
devoted a lover to make any difficulty where Daphne's
wishes are concerned."</p>

<p>"That is all right," said Miss Riga with a winning
smile, intended for Mr. Gray's benefit.</p>

<p>She held out her hand as a cue for his departure.</p>

<p>"I think myself," she said, holding his hand in

<!-- page 56 -->

hers, and fixing her queer eyes straight on his, "I
feel myself, that whatever Daphne does, specially
under the direction of his Master, Julian will approve
of. Don't you agree with me, Mr. Gray?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," he said, "have I not already said
so."</p>

<p>Arthur Gray having once got out of the house and
a little way on the road, stopped in the street, lifted
his hat, looked into it, and fell into a profound reverie.
Probably if a brilliant policeman had found
him he would have been taken into custody for some
reason or other, for he certainly could not account
for himself at that moment. All his thoughts were
of Daphne Royal. "What on earth is that old woman
up to!" he said to himself. "I hate her, so I came
away; and I was a fool to do it, for if I had stayed
I might have learned what her little game is. That
silly fool, Julian, has gone away on a wild-goose
chase to the North Pole, or some other salubrious
region, and left this dear girl to take her chance. She
is not fit for it, she is no match for that money-making
hag. I must keep up to the old lady's game,
and I must fall into it whether I like it or not, for

<!-- page 57 -->

I will not leave Daphne alone in her clutches."</p>

<p>Daphne, sitting in the chair into which she sank
when Gray read the translation of the Sanscrit message,
was now looking earnestly at Miss Riga, and
studying her face with an anxiety worthy of a better
cause.</p>

<p>"Dear auntie," she said, "are you convinced
that this message came from Julian's Master?"</p>

<p>"Have you any reason to doubt it?" asked Miss
Riga, turning round fiercely, lifting her glasses and
staring at Daphne.</p>

<p>"I have no reason to doubt it," said Daphne,
"but at the same time I cannot see what proof
there is."</p>

<p>"Why, my dear," said the old lady, "who else
should send you messages, fluttering in the air in the
middle of the night? Who else should take the trouble
to tell you what to do? Julian has been selected for
a great mission. Julian himself, his mere body and
his purse are at the service of his Master in a remote
country, of which we know nothing. We, my child,
are custodians of his wealth in the meantime, and
his wealth is to be used in the service of the Master.

<!-- page 58 -->

Don't you see that? Do you doubt the existence of
this Master, whose simple order has made you sacrifice
your lover, your peace, your comfort, and your home?
If you could let Julian go on such an enterprise without
a protest, surely you could obey the orders of
his Master in trivialities, which have only to deal
with party walls and money matters."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, dear aunt, you are quite right," said
Daphne. "To part with Julian was a great trial on
my faith. If I could believe so far, nothing else
should be difficult; but it is so hard to decide anything
when he is away from me."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Miss Riga, contentedly, taking
a comfortable chair by the side of the fire, "you
should have thought of that before you let him go.
Having let him go you must do your best in his
absence, and consider yourself, so to speak, vice-president
of this great movement."</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Daphne went up to her room that evening,
she was filled with a very curious feeling of terror
and anxiety. She had a large bureau standing between
the two windows. In it she kept all her treasures,
and these treasures were of some value, she
being a young woman of property. She had her
jewel-case here, she had her bank-book, and she had
a great many other papers and different documents
of importance. But none of these amounted to
anything in her sight, compared to a certain paper
which had been put inside this desk and locked on
the night before Julian went away.</p>

<p>This was a paper very quickly drawn up by his
solicitor, meaning a very great deal to her, and it was
simply a power of attorney over the whole of Julian
Arundel's property given to her. It, of course, remained
in abeyance until her twenty-first birthday.
But that was close at hand, only a few days off. All

<!-- page 60 -->

her life, since she and Julian had talked of love, she
had expected that that day would be her wedding-day,
instead of which it had been made into a day
on which she had complete control over all his property
while he himself seemed lost to her for ever.</p>

<p>But this was not troubling her so acutely for the
moment; she was very well aware that Miss Riga
knew that she held this paper. She was very well
aware that whatever Miss Riga decided should be
done with regard to Julian's possessions could be
done by herself, and she had a terrible certainty that
Miss Riga's will was so strong that whatever she decided
to be done would be done. What then did it all
mean?&mdash;that is what Daphne wondered as she sat
down, her bureau unlocked and this paper before her.
By its side lay another paper which she had placed
there, and this was the mysterious message from
the Master&mdash;a message which bore no conviction to
her heart, which seemed to her nothing but a scrap
of Julian's note-book, and scrawled hastily in a
disguised hand.</p>

<p>No doubt Daphne was naturally an incredulous
person. Some people would have been convinced

<!-- page 61 -->

by the fact of this message coming to her when she
was alone, but Daphne was not convinced; she was
very doubtful. She thought it was some freak of
one of the maids, and she would have thought it had
been a dream if the paper had not been actually there.</p>

<p>But she could not believe that it came from a supernatural
power. Nevertheless she saw that her
duty lay plain before her. This message had one
word in it which she could read. It was written in
Sanscrit, but it was signed by a single name, and
that name was Morial. Against this signature she
could say nothing,- she could do nothing, for the name
of Morial was the name always given by Julian's
Master. A message signed in this way she must obey.
Having arrived at this point of decision she locked
up the papers and got up with a deep sigh from
the bureau.</p>

<p>As she did so, a strange thing happened. When
Julian had been painting Morial's portrait, and talking
to her about it, and telling her what a beautiful
figure and what a lovely face the Master possessed,
she came by degrees to realise the presence of this
unseen being. She had acquired a vivid idea of what

<!-- page 62 -->

he was like, and when she saw his counterfeit presentment
on Julian's canvas, she recognised the face of
her fancy, and the figure of her dreams. Now she
rose from her bureau and turned to the room, it appeared
to her that the door opened and this same
figure entered. It advanced towards her, not near,&mdash;she
felt as if its presence would have killed her if it
came too near.</p>

<p>It appeared to her that scorching rays emanated
from it. It paused in the centre of the room, extending
one hand towards her, and then words entered
her mind, though she heard no voice, "Child," said
this figure, "obey me; do not allow your foolish reason
and your weak intellect to stand between you and
the great life. I will guide you if you will obey me."</p>

<p>Daphne hesitated in silence, but a moment after
the words reached her, it appeared to her that now
Julian's own Master had spoken to her. She clasped
her hands together, she fell on her knees, and a
moment later she fell forward on the floor, and in
the attitude of subjection which a disciple always
adopts.</p>

<p>Daphne was very ill all that night. Her maid and

<!-- page 63 -->

old Miss Riga were up with her, tending her carefully,
for she seemed to be in a fever. The old family
doctor was sent for, but could not tell what was the
matter with her, except that she was feverish and
quite prostrated. In the middle of the morning Miss
Riga came to her and said, "Now, Daphne, tell me,
shall I obey the mysterious orders, or shall I act
according to the dictates of common sense?"</p>

<p>"Obey them," said Daphne, very decidedly, "but
it does not seem to me," she went on, "you have
very clear directions. What are these orders?"</p>

<p>"I have them," said Miss Riga, very positively,
"The message came to me last night. We have
to found a great school of divine teaching in this
country. We have to kill all the false religions of
the earth. We have to plant the pure spirit of
Buddhism in their stead. Is not this a great mission,
dear child? Have we not work to do that any
women would be proud of?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes," said Daphne. "Do as you like,"
she said. "You must attend to all the details."</p>

<p>Miss Riga leaned over and whispered into her ear,
"Child," she said, "it will cost money, but this

<!-- page 64 -->

money is all given to the Master, and for the great
work. You will pay it, you promise me, if I obey
his orders."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Daphne. "Of course, if you
obey his orders, I shall obey mine in giving you
what money is necessary; but, dear aunt, let me see
these orders&mdash;let me know what you have to do."</p>

<p>"Not yet," said Miss Riga; "you are not strong
enough. I am quite capable of learning the full
effulgence of this inspiration. You know, my child,
that in my family we have had second-sight for more
than ten generations. It is natural to us to see the
unseen, and to hear words that are not spoken. Let
me, therefore, listen to the mysterious utterances
that come to me and obey them. You know very
well that I am working only according to the wishes
of the Master, who has taken Julian from you. And,
my child, you must know that the more rapidly we
fulfil his behest, the sooner he will give Julian back
to you."</p>

<p>Naturally this argument had great weight with
Daphne, who in her present state of complete acquiescence
and surrender of her own judgment was

<!-- page 65 -->

very unhappy. She fully realised that if Julian had
been with her it would have been possible to make
a more critical analysis of the situation. She was
not strong enough alone. Once or twice she thought
seriously of asking Mr. Gray whether that really was
the interpretation of the message, whether it was
really written in Sanscrit, and whether he really could
read it. Then, when she made up her mind to this,
the memory of the vision she had seen checked her.
That was real; therefore, she had nothing to say
any more.</p>

<p>She decided that her best and her most righteous
course was that of obedient submission. She felt
that she was in the midst of great mysteries both of
earth and heaven. She could understand nothing,
she could not see what object was to be gained for
Julian by his being taken from his right work and
being lost to the world as he was, nor could she understand
how she and her old aunt were to found a
great religion. Lost in these perplexities, she resolved
to wait till circumstances gave her some new
guidance, and in the meantime to sacrifice whatever
she could for what appeared to be the great cause.</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Julian Arundel opened his eyes after his first
deep sleep of exhaustion he was so surprised at what
he saw that sleep fled from him altogether. He
lay gazing and wondering whether he was still dreaming
or not. But his imagination had never conjured
up a scene like this even in his most excited moments;
and so he was fain to believe it real.</p>

<p>He himself was laid on a low couch which was
covered with sheepskin, a large wolfskin had been
thrown over him, and the warmth was an absorbing
delight in itself after the agonies of cold he had endured.
The languor which held him in a quiet which
seemed like that of a trance was simply nature's way
of making recovery a pleasure. And what a pleasure
it was, with such a sight to look idly at as he lay half
dozing! His couch was placed at the far end of a
large and lofty room; the walls and ceiling of this
room were gilded; and Julian noticed immediately
the splendour of this gilding. He had never seen

<!-- page 67 -->

anything to equal it; and though the Tibetan gilding
never shows to such supreme advantage as in the
open air, lit by the sunshine, and set off by the snow,
still its beauty in a lamp-lit room is wonderful. The
passion of the religious Tibetans for gilding is so great
that a race of foreigners, the Pebonans from Bontan,
are tolerated in the country solely because of their
skill in this labour. Julian's love of light and colour
was excited to the highest degree by the glow of this
rich gilding, illuminated as it was by the light of a
number of coloured lamps. The mystic Buddhist
"mani" was written over the door: "Om mani
padmi noum," in dark blue letters. Julian was familiar
with this sentence, as every dabbler in occultism
must be, and like every one else had made his own
individual guess at its meaning; so that it seemed
like a friendly spot in the scene. The air was laden
with an intensely sweet scent, an odour which afterwards
became a positive passion with him. The
sweetness of the aromatic Tibetan pastilles is unlike
any other fragrance in the world. But all these delights
were forgotten, when at last Julian was sufficiently
aware to realise that the room was lined with

<!-- page 68 -->

figures. Lined literally, for the lamas were ranged
round the walls like statues. All wore the yellow
robe of the higher grades. They knelt, immovably,
as if fast locked in eternal prayer. No movement
was made, except that sometimes a gaunt hand would
touch the rosary which each one held&mdash;and sometimes
a face was lifted a little, and glance thrown
round the room.</p>

<p>The faces fascinated Julian, so that he could only
look from one to the other, studying them intently.
They looked as if carved out of rock; severe, cold,
forbidding, and, in some instances, savage. But the
glances of those fierce eyes, when lifted!&mdash;glances
such as wild animals on the watch might throw upon
their prey!&mdash;covert, fierce, menacing.</p>

<p>"And these," said Julian to himself, "are the lamas
of Tibet! the priests of the greatest religion in the
world! I would as soon be Daniel in the lions' den
as a peaceful European in this lamasery! They look
like committing any kind of cannibalism. But how
I wish I could take a sketch of them, kneeling there
as immovably as a row of Egyptian mummies!"</p>

<p>Julian had one treasure which he carried slung

<!-- page 69 -->

round his neck by a chain; the only piece of luggage
he had succeeded in bringing into Tibet. This was
a sketch-book. He knew it would be madness to
attempt to use it until he had ascertained whether his
formidable gaolers were friendly or not; yet the
longing within him made him stir a little and move
his hand toward his breast, where this treasure was
hidden.</p>

<p>Instantly there was a stir among the lamas; they
rose to their feet, slowly, as became men roused from
their devotions. They approached him, and in a
moment Julian was surrounded by these men, who
scrutinised him with great interest, and talked together
in the soft Tibetan tongue. It was the first time Julian
had heard it, and he listened with a keen delight and
interest, wondering whether he should ever master its
meaning. It was strange to lie there like some exotic
animal, and know that these men were discussing him&mdash;and
possibly his fate!&mdash;and yet be unable even to
conjecture what they said. He could guess nothing
from the expression of their faces: the stoniness of
the features did not alter when they talked. Only the
occasional flashes of the fierce, small eyes, indicated

<!-- page 70 -->

(as he thought) the vulture-like spirit repressed by
monasticism.</p>

<p>"I would as soon be on the mountains or in that
dreadful graveyard as here, in spite of the warmth
and comfort," thought Julian, dejectedly, as he surveyed
the crowd about him.</p>

<p>"How am I to get out of this place?" was his next
reflection, and he half rose on his couch from the
mere instinct of flight. The effect of this was rather
startling. The lamas all closed together immediately
in the direction in which he moved. It was done so
instantaneously and without any word of command,
that he recognised very plainly that he was in close
custody.</p>

<p>"Not much use thinking of escape," he reflected
grimly. "I must wait and see this out. If I am to
be saved, I suppose I shall be saved."</p>

<p>Here spoke the true spirit of the disciple, who hoped
to succeed according to the preaching which is called
Esoteric. Julian lay down again, resolving simply
to wait and watch. Very soon he was rewarded by
something happening which concerned himself. A
panel or gilded wall close to him moved; he saw it

<!-- page 71 -->

was a cunningly contrived secret door. An inferior
lama entered, closing it behind him, and, advancing
to the others, addressed them. What he said appeared
to cause some discussion among them, but before
long they evidently came to a unanimous decision.
As a result of this one of them approached Julian to
motion to him to rise. This he did with great alacrity,
feeling himself quite recovered and decidedly curious
to know his fate. His magnificent constitution had
stood him in good stead during his recent ordeal,
and the long rest he had had&mdash;for, as a matter of fact,
though he did not yet know it, he had lain in a profound
sleep for hours in this warmed and scented
room&mdash;had entirely restored him. He felt now ready
to face any enemy, prepared to encounter any danger
that stood in his path. The lamas motioned to him
to proceed to the great door of the room over which
was the mystic inscription. He advanced, guarded
among them as though he was under an escort of
soldiers. The door opened into a vestibule whitewashed
both on the walls and on the ceiling. The
doors were outlined and decorated in red and yellow
with a quaintness that pleased Julian's artistic fancy,

<!-- page 72 -->

even in this moment of uncertainty and suspense.
He was in a darkness of profound ignorance; he knew
not, he could not guess, where he was being taken,
or for what purpose. They led him through several
corridors, all whitewashed and decorated in the same
manner, and presently emerged into the open air.
He saw then the wonder of the night which arrested
his attention so completely that he really forgot his
own danger, and perhaps for the moment even his mission.
The sky was a black-blue colour, lit by the stars
which seemed so large that he fancied that he was
almost in another world. The moon was at its full
and shed a flood of white light all over the valley, lighting
up the gilded domes of the lamasery, and giving
to them a strange cold brilliance. He saw at a second
glance that this lamasery was like a township, so large
was it. It was composed of a number of buildings
all arranged one above another. Away on the other
side of the valley was the fortress. He could just
distinguish it, although it looked dark and gloomy.
But here in the home of the great religion everything
seemed to glitter. His delight in this scene was so
evident that the lamas noticed it, and seemed morosely

<!-- page 73 -->

amused. Probably they looked upon him as
a poor heathen who had never seen anything decent
before. He was not given long in which to satisfy
the pleasure he felt; they passed one or two of the
buildings, and then paused before the door of one.
It was standing open; to Julian's surprise&mdash;in fact,
amazement&mdash;two Chinamen were in charge of the
door, one on each side of it. These gentlemen evidently
expected the great body of visitors who arrived,
for they simply bowed with all celestial politeness,
and ushered them in. The building which Julian
now entered appeared to him to be composed of a
vast suite of rooms, all whitewashed, and very simply
furnished. None of the splendour he had left was
here. At the same time, there was abundant comfort.
The large room into which he was first taken was
occupied by a whole crowd of Chinese, who seemed
immensely interested in his appearance. The lamas,
however, maintained a species of human wall around
him. Evidently they considered him a sacred charge,
whether for good or evil he knew not. Passing
through this room, they entered another, somewhat
more luxurious, in which a few Chinamen, evidently

<!-- page 74 -->

of superior grade, were busy talking together and
looking over papers. They, too, were interested in
him, but in a more civilised fashion. Two more
rooms of this character were passed, and then they
entered one which was fully furnished in the Chinese
manner. Its aspect appeared to him most fantastic
and delightful, for Julian had never been to China,
and knew nothing more of its charms of decoration
than can be learned in Regent Street. A young
Chinaman, most beautifully dressed, received the
company at the door of this chamber, and, with many
bows of the elegant sort, ushered them into the room.
At the far end, upon a kind of a throne covered with
a red cloth, was seated a Chinaman, who appeared
to Julian to be a man of some sixty years of age, and
who had great dignity of appearance. Before him
was a little table of elaborate lacquer work, on which
was an inkstand, some writing materials and a little
silver vase containing snuff, which Julian looked at
with longing gaze, only wishing he had it at home
as a studio property.&mdash;But he had now reached a
time when it was impossible any longer to gratify his
artistic sensibilities. He had at last realised the position

<!-- page 75 -->

in which he was placed, and clearly this was the
guest house or Lamasery; clearly also the guests now
occupying it were nothing more or less than a Chinese
Embassy. This fate&mdash;the awful fate of falling into
the hands of the Chinese&mdash;Julian had seriously hoped
to escape. It was the one thing he had dreaded, in
spite of all his heroism, for dreadful are the tales told
to enterprising travellers of the tortures inflicted by
the Chinese on those whom they think may be spies,
or who may possibly in any way afford them information.
Suddenly, without a moments preparation,
he found himself in the face of this danger. What
was to be done he knew not. Having entered the
room of the ambassador, the lamas withdrew from
their prisoner, leaving him standing alone in the centre
of the floor, they themselves ranging against the
wall in the quaint fashion of most of the Oriental
races. The young Chinaman who appeared to be
master of the ceremonies, and who certainly commanded
every grace possible, now held a long conversation
with the Ambassador, who during the whole
of it surveyed Julian with the greatest curiosity and
interest. The result of this, after some time, was a

<!-- page 76 -->

course of interrogations in various languages. The
young Chinaman advanced, and with a deep bow
addressed Julian in Tibetan. In reply to this Julian
adopted the simple expedient of shaking his head and
saying, "I don't understand you."</p>

<p>The ambassador then addressed him in Hindustani,
and to Julian's regret he had to make the same
reply in the same manner. After this, the ambassador
evidently tested him in several Indian dialects.
All this was perfectly hopeless, and it was very evident
to Julian that, if he chose to hold his tongue, no
cross-examination could take place, for these men
would never think of addressing him in their own
language. As a matter of fact, he did know a little
Chinese, having met some Chinese ambassadors who
came to London on a visit, and who made themselves
most charming at many of the Piccadilly and Grosvenor
Square receptions. Their sweet manners and
bland expressions had so delighted him that he had
fraternised with them a little, and had persuaded
them to teach him a few sentences of their language
and some of its fundamental rules. He was perfectly
aware that if he chose he could explain quite intelligibly

<!-- page 77 -->

to the ambassador that he was an Englishman
who wished to penetrate the interior of Tibet, with
no political or ulterior object. But would it be wise
to do this, or would it be better to be silent? How
was it possible for him to tell; his mind was torn
between the two alternatives, and he looked wildly
around, searching for something that would give him
an idea of what to do; and this something came.
The walls of the chamber were hung with sombre
draperies of black silk, embroidered in dull gold.
Right across these he suddenly saw some characters
which instantly attracted his attention, not only because
they were of vivid crimson, of blood colour or
of fire, but because they came and went while he
looked. He then suddenly remembered that he was
no ordinary wanderer, no ordinary mortal at the
mercy of an official, but that he was a disciple of
Morial, and if he was worthy to be a disciple, he
would be guided. Standing, therefore, in the midst
of these crowds of enemies of two nationalities, he
recovered his calmness, and waited to see what the
mystic words would be which he presumed would
convey to him his order.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 78 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daphne</span> also was looking at the stars on this moonlight
night, and wondered why, if they looked down
upon Julian and herself alike, they could not give her
any message from him. For Daphne was one
accustomed to question the dictates of Providence
and to attempt to scale heights which never could be
compassed. She was standing on the balcony of her
London house when she looked at these same stars
which Julian saw flaming like suns in the clear Tibetan
sky. To Daphne they seemed, in all their splendour
and beauty, very impotent and pale and small.
Hers was the old cry just now&mdash;"Is there no mercy
in the pitiless sky," for she was troubled and harassed
beyond words, and it seemed to her that for Julian to
leave her with such great responsibilities and to face
such great dangers was no right thing for any just
Master to have ordered. The balcony on which she

<!-- page 79 -->

stood was outside the windows of the drawing-room
of her house. It was covered in with trellis work
over which a Virginian creeper was trained, and many
a time when they had had parties here in the summer
evenings of the season, Daphne had sat out among
these creepers, and talked and laughed, like the light-hearted
girl she had been. Now she wondered
whether she ever had been such a girl, whether these
merry parties, so common in every-day life had ever
taken place here. It was late in the night, indeed
it was nearly morning, for just now when Daphne
stepped out on to the balcony Julian had entered the
room of the Chinese Embassy. Perhaps in her sympathetic
nature she felt the trouble he was in, or perhaps
it was her own troubles that made her so restless,
but at all events she had not been able to sleep.
She had never liked her own room since these mysterious
missives had begun to float down upon her in
the night, and when she could not rest she had a
habit of going into the open air. The wide balcony
outside the drawing-room window was a delightful
and quiet spot. She was sitting here, like a ghost
wrapped in a white cloak, and thinking, too, more

<!-- page 80 -->

like a ghost than an ordinary girl who should have
had every hope and comfort in life.</p>

<p>"What can it all mean?" she was saying to herself.
"Why is everything so eerie and unnatural just
now, and, what is more, so horribly uncomfortable.
Not that I should mind this. I only wish I was away
with Julian on his dangerous journey, for then I
should feel I was doing something real. But why
should we be worried out of our lives about what
seems like nothing? I suppose it is all right, but
how can I tell? I shall never know until Julian
comes back."</p>

<p>Having come to this conclusion for the hundredth
time, she rose up and went back into the drawing-room,
and then paused on her way, as she always
paused now, to look at the great change which had
been effected in it. In one wall an immense arch
had been made, heavily curtained, for the work was
now quite completed. Neither money nor trouble
had been spared to get it rapidly done. Why, no
one knew, only these were the orders from the mysterious
source whence all the new orders came. The
curtains were looped back after the manner of curtains

<!-- page 81 -->

on the stage, drawn up in the centre. And
through this great space Daphne could see the dim,
shadowy interior of Julian's painting room, his old
studio. This very night the room, as well as the
drawing-room of her house, had been thronged with
visitors&mdash;people whom she had never seen or heard
of before, and most of them people she did not like,
even when she saw them. It annoyed her that this
crowd should be in possession of Julian's sanctum in
his absence and without his leave, but what could
she do, or what could she say? At the far end of
the studio stood Julian's largest painting easel, and
on it was a picture framed most splendidly in a frame
which had doors and a strong lock. These doors
were always safely fastened, except at special moments
when Miss Riga herself would place a little
golden key in an elaborate lock, and with much ceremony
open it. The mystery then revealed was Julian's
portrait of Morial the Mahatma. On the previous
evening this portrait had been shown to a select
few. Daphne thinking of it again began to walk from
end to end of the two great rooms, pondering in her
mind what it all could mean and what was right for

<!-- page 82 -->

her to do. She thought over all that Miss Riga had said
to this select few who had remained after the others
had departed. Miss Riga had made a kind of little
speech to them, which she had evidently thought
over and rehearsed beforehand, and for which Daphne
was wholly unprepared.</p>

<p>"My friends," said Miss Riga, "the Master has
greatly distinguished us. He has chosen this spot as
the centre of the new religion, which is indeed simply
the oldest religion in the world and the only true
one. He has chosen those who dwell in this house
as his disciples to do his will. The strongest he has
taken away; for the time being we have lost the one
whom we ought to lean on. Julian Arundel has gone,
at his Master's call, into Tibet to meet his Master
face to face and receive his teaching, so that he may
bring it back fresh from the fountainhead into this
country. In the meantime, we women, who, because
we are women, never can become disciples of
a high grade, are yet distinguished as women have
never been before, and perhaps never will be again.
This is not because of our own merit, but because we
are needed. This is to be a great movement in this

<!-- page 83 -->

country. Its present religion will fall and give place
to that of which it is a mere offshoot&mdash;a mere babe.
The light of the true Esoteric teaching, that which is
not mere Buddhism but inspired Buddhism, is to
spring up here in the midst of London, the capital of
a Christian country. And we, Daphne Royal and I,
are the poor weak creatures chosen to carry out this
great work until stronger ones can join us. We must
fulfil our task nobly, looking for the end. Think of
the great moment when the Master, who appeared in
this very room to the inspired artist who painted the
portrait, shall be able to enter it bodily; think of the
great moment when we have made this place sufficiently
purified for the Master to enter it in the flesh.
That is what he wants; he wants this place made fit
to be a true Lamasery, and a place in which he could
find a home if he needed it. We cannot do this
altogether alone, for there is much to do. Already
we have received orders that would tax our strength
beyond what is possible. We must have a little
band of devoted workers to surround us and support
us&mdash;support us in the true spirit of pure religion, for
the world is a very hard place to live in, and never

<!-- page 84 -->

so hard as when one is trying to fight ones way to a
higher life."</p>

<p>This was the sum and substance of Miss Riga's
memorable speech, with which she celebrated the
occasion of the founding of what she called a "Lodge."
Daphne had confused ideas, gathered from reading
novels more than anything else, of the system adopted
by the Freemasons which they had borrowed from
the Rosicrucians, and it was clear to her on reflecting
over it that Miss Riga had been reading up the system
of Freemasonry and was proposing to adopt an
imitation of it.</p>

<p>"But what are these people to do, what are they
to be?" Daphne questioned and questioned. Although
it was very late when the little group of the elect left
the house, Daphne had learned before she went to
her room that several of them really proposed to
enter the mystic lodge. This meant much more than
might seem apparent at first sight. Daphne had
heard with much surprise that two of these persons
proposed to take up residence in the house on the
very next day. They were enthusiasts, fanatics, who
thought themselves doing as great a deed in surrendering

<!-- page 85 -->

their home ties as was Julian in his terrible pilgrimage.
What most troubled Daphne was the fact
that Miss Riga refused now to take her into her confidence.
She assured her, as she assured the other
devotees, that she was receiving letters from the
Master. She told her that she could not for the present
show them to her or to any one else, but promised
to do so later. In the meantime she demanded
from her trust and obedience. Daphne, who had
plenty of courage, would have refused this if it had
not been for that vision which she had herself seen
of Morial himself. The entanglement was one which
she was unable to see through. Nevertheless she
was very unhappy in realising the tremendous change
that was about to be made in her home life. For,
on the very next day, the houses which had been
one her own, and one Julian's, were to be made into
the strange thing which Miss Riga called a Lamasery.
Miss Riga's definition of it was a place in
which people dwelt who had given up ordinary life,
with all its claims and its attractions, and were
ready by discipline to become true disciples. Walking
up and down, Daphne pondered very seriously

<!-- page 86 -->

over the whole position, and spared herself no painful
criticism. She brought before her mind's eye the
two new disciples, the two original members of the
"Lodge?" of Eastern wisdom in the West. One
was a Mrs. Flite, a lady whose acquaintance Miss
Riga had very recently made, with whom she had
struck up an ardent friendship, and whom she
habitually spoke of as a true soul, "the same as
myself." Mrs. Flite was one of those peculiar wrecks
left after a youth of extreme prettiness. She was
small&mdash;petite&mdash;with a tiny face highly rouged, lit up
by dark eyes full of arch meanings. At the first
glance she seemed like a woman of thirty, for she
wore a fair, curly wig which reached her eyebrows,
and carried herself with much of the gaiety of a girl.
This lady, who had hitherto cared for nothing but
parties and social gatherings of any sort, had now
become an earnest neophyte in the new faith, and
was ready to take any vows or to make any sacrifice
in the cause. The other new disciple, Mr. Foster, was
an exceedingly tall young man, who appeared to
possess immense accumulations of learning. He
seemed to be so profoundly acquainted with every

<!-- page 87 -->

science and art that Miss Riga and Mrs. Flite both
assured him that he must have passed innumerable
incarnations in order to be so wise at such an early
age. He also announced that he was willing to give
up the brilliant career before him in secular life, and
endeavour at any cost to learn how to become a
Mahatma if Miss Riga would but accept him. He
also was accepted. Daphne thought over the scene
with a keen feeling of rebellion. She did not want
these people in her house. She did not know them,
and she did not like them. What did it mean? Why
should they come? Within her breast had risen a
feeling of strong protest.</p>

<p>She was on the eve of going to Miss Riga, rousing
her, and telling her she would have her own way.
The thought of doing this had come to her, and she
paused in the middle of the great drawing-room
thinking what she should do, when suddenly she
gave a faint shriek and fled to the door. Then taking
her courage in both hands she turned round,
walked back into the room, and looked through the
arch into Julian's studio. Yes, she was not mistaken,
it was no illusion. There was the writing on the

<!-- page 88 -->

wall&mdash;the blood-red characters&mdash;they came and
went like lambent gleams of fire. A message was
written there for her, and it was the same message
that Julian read on the wall of the room in the
lamasery of Tibet!</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 89 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER X.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> were the words which Julian saw written upon
the wall at the same time as Daphne, although
these two were separated by the great span of the
world. That it was no ordinary writing was only
too evident, for it came and went just like letters of
fire, that might be blown out and then burn again.
Julian stood regarding them in wonder and awe, but
presently his attention was attracted by hearing the
ambassador and his secretary talking together. Although
he knew very little Chinese, he knew enough
to follow their conversation. To his horror he
gathered that they had decided to claim him as a
prisoner and take him to China, right across Western
Tibet. Not even the possible tortures he might have
suffered if at once treated as a spy alarmed him so
much as the idea of this journey. Eight months of

<!-- page 90 -->

wasted, useless travelling, and then to fall into the
hands of Chinese officials, and be practically as far as
ever from his Master, and far, indeed, from his own
home. This must be prevented; what should he do?
Again the letters came flaming out, and he instantly
concluded that here must be his guide. Where was
the crimson star? What was it? He looked all
round the room hoping to find some tangible symbol,
obeisance to which might win him favour in sight of
the officials. But there was nothing of the sort anywhere.
A deep dejection fell upon him, he had no
idea how to act. He stood still, having thoroughly
examined the room, looking at the ambassador and
trying to hear all that he said, for he knew very well
that his fate lay in this man's hands.</p>

<p>And, as he stood there, silent, hopeless, and horror-stricken
at the condition he found himself in, he suddenly
saw something which electrified him. As the
ambassador sat there making some notes, and speaking
the while to his secretary, over his head, in the air
that a moment since was empty, appeared a crimson
star! perfectly clear in outline and brilliant in colour.
Julian could trace it plainly. It was formed by the

<!-- page 91 -->

double triangle with the point downwards. Here
must be his chance, his safeguard; the supernatural
again was leading him! His confidence returned;
he flung away his own judgment, and obeyed the
mystic guidance. Instantly he fell on his knees.
The ambassador and secretary looked at him in the
utmost amazement.</p>

<p>"What is this man kneeling for?" said the ambassador.</p>

<p>"I cannot guess," replied the secretary.</p>

<p>Julian resolved now to fling aside the caution
which appeared to be useless, and to speak to the
ambassador.</p>

<p>"I am kneeling," he said in Chinese, speaking
with some difficulty, but clearly enough, "to the
Crimson Star."</p>

<p>The ambassador rose with a start from his seat;
he was seized with a sudden and powerful agitation,
which evidently perplexed the secretary as much as
Julian's action had done. Ki-Chan, the ambassador,
came hastily from his place and advanced to Julian,
his face working with a strong emotion which he
could not conceal. Indeed, he did not seem to make

<!-- page 92 -->

any effort to conceal it; he was too entirely overcome.
The secretary advanced to him and touched
him on the shoulder. This recalled him a little to
himself, and he immediately gave a gesture of command,
dismissing all who were present except Julian
and the secretary. The secretary, however, appeared
to Julian to stay of his own accord, and Ki-Chan evidently
did not like this. Recovering himself sufficiently
to speak to him with politeness he asked
him to go also.</p>

<p>"Now," said the ambassador when they were quite
alone; "rise, the star has been recognised and has
acknowledged the recognition. Who are you, tell
me, and whence do you come?"</p>

<p>Julian looked at him in the greatest doubt and perplexity.
Should he tell him&mdash;was it not madness to
talk of his Master to a Chinese official? to tell such a
man as this that his aim was to penetrate into the interior
of Tibet, a region that the Chinese officials themselves
had never succeeded in entering? But a kind of
despair fell on him at the thought of being, as he was,
so completely in this man's power. If he did not
find a friend in him what hope had he? None; he

<!-- page 93 -->

would simply be taken a prisoner across the steppes
of Tartary into China. He had just come to this conclusion
when Ki-Chan, who had been observing his
doubt with keen anxiety, approached him and spoke
with great earnestness:</p>

<p>"You could not see the Crimson Star, you could
not recognise it if you were not a servant of the great
Morial. That you see the star above my head shows
you that I am one of his trusted servants crowned by
his special mark. Surely then you need not hesitate
to trust me?"</p>

<p>This argument decided Julian; he hesitated no
longer. In lame and halt Chinese, but with sufficient
clearness to be understood, he began to tell the ambassador
the simple facts which brought him into this
strange situation. Ki-Chan listened as to a wild and
thrilling romance. At the same time Julian noticed
that he was not so much overpowered by the supernatural
part of the narrative as he was by the fact
that this new disciple was an Englishman, who had
come straight from London. Ki-Chan had met Englishmen
at Pekin, and had heard a great deal of
their wonderful country. But he had never yet seen

<!-- page 94 -->

an Englishman within the borders of Tibet, a fact
which evidently had singular importance with him,
and interested him in a way which Julian could not
then understand.</p>

<p>"You are the Master's servant," said Ki-Chan. "I
bow to the name of the Master as you bow to the
Crimson Star. You are my charge from this moment.
When Morial permits two disciples to meet, it
is with an object, and he thinks us poor fools if we
cannot guess what we are to do without being told.
I presume that my task is to send you under safe
escort as far as I can into Hither Tibet. That is the
one thing I can do, and, therefore, it is evidently
what I have to do. You shall go on your journey as
early on the morrow as I can have your escort arranged.
It will be a terrible journey, even as far as
I can give you protection. For there are no halting
places for caravans, there are no great Lamaseries
like this, and, worse still, there are no roads. Riding
in the desert or across the steppes, as you will
have to do for many a long league, will be nothing
as a matter of difficulty compared to getting over the
rocky parts of the mountains. I myself once made

<!-- page 95 -->

the pilgrimage, and I know how awful it is. You
had better ride a yak, which goes slowly but surely.
Horses, in leaping over these rocks, often stumble,
however sure-footed they may be; and camels die
in the rarified air. Does not this account of what
you have before you intimidate you?" he asked,
looking curiously at Julian.</p>

<p>"Nothing will intimidate me now," replied Julian,
"after what I have passed through. I am young and
strong, and have but one object&mdash;to find the Master."</p>

<p>"But one object," Ki-Chan repeated after him; "is
that really so? I cannot doubt your word, as you
have recognized the sign of the order, and therefore I
will believe all that you say. But I must tell you that
you stand in greater danger in this country, being
an Englishman, than if you belonged to any other
nation in the world. The Tibetans have an idea that
the English is the one conquering race. No Englishman
has been permitted to enter the interior except
poor Moorcroft, who, after studying the country and
its traditions for twelve years, hoped to go back and
enrich the West with his knowledge. But although
they had allowed him to live here, he was really only

<!-- page 96 -->

a prisoner, although he did not know it. When it
was found that he intended to go back to the West,
he was murdered without hesitation. If you penetrate
into the interior you will never return, unless,
indeed, the Master thinks you worthy of protection.
He has never thought it worth while to protect any
man yet who has gone to him in his solitude."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said Julian, somewhat doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is so," replied the ambassador; "for
you must know, of course, that those disciples who
determine to leave the world and actually go to the
feet of the Master, are idealists, fanatics, and it is
only once in a century, perhaps not so often, that
such men have the stamina in them to be of any
use."</p>

<p>"Then you think," said Julian, "that even if I
reach him, I shall be no safer there than here?"</p>

<p>"Not unless you are that one aloe of a century,"
replied the ambassador, with an inscrutable smile.
"You will never know until the moment of your
fate; but I warn you that if you are protected now
it may not always be so. And if the Tibetans, in
those districts where the English have been heard

<!-- page 97 -->

of, discover you are an Englishman, your doom is
sealed."</p>

<p>"But why?" said Julian, "they are already conquered:
they have nothing to fear."</p>

<p>"Conquered!" answered Ki-Chan. "That, my
friend, is one of those appearances which are entirely
opposed to reality. The world itself is ruled by
Morial. Is it likely, then, that another nation could
conquer his native country?"</p>

<p>"What does the Chinese rule in Tibet mean, then?"
inquired Julian, much surprised at this new aspect
of the matter.</p>

<p>"It is simply nominal," replied the ambassador;
"or, to speak more correctly, it is useful in a simple
way. The Chinese officials and soldiers keep the
lower class of Tibetans in order and save the high
class a great deal of trouble. The pure nobles in
Tibet are magicians and they much prefer to hold
their country without claiming it, being always engaged
with much larger affairs than the government
of a district of Asia. The one serious matter to them
with regard to Tibet itself is that it should be for ever
protected from incursions of any sort. The English

<!-- page 98 -->

have never been permitted to come here, because
they are credited with great powers, perhaps correctly,
I know not; therefore conceal your nationality
if you can."</p>

<p>"Tell me," said Julian, returning to a subject which
interested him much more deeply, "how shall I know
when I reach my journey's end? That has always
troubled my mind a great deal more than any of the
hardships by the way. For I am not like a person
who is going to a certain place, the name of which
can be found on the map, or at all events asked for;
I only know that the Master is hidden in the depths
of this great country."</p>

<p>The ambassador fell into a deep reverie, walking
about the room and thinking. Presently he roused
himself, and, coming back to Julian, began to talk
once more.</p>

<p>"After a certain part of the journey is over," he
said, "it is impossible to give you any directions,
as it is impossible to give you any escort, because
neither my Chinese soldiers nor the ordinary Lamas
will be permitted to go any further. You will enter
a great region in the very heart of the country where

<!-- page 99 -->

the protection of man no longer exists; the Great
Ones keep it protected by their magic powers. I
cannot direct you, although I have passed over the
ground once&mdash;and once only. How could I direct
you? There is no township to stay in, there is not
even any dwelling to pass. I have been thinking in
my mind of the great rocks I noticed, of the marvellous
fountain which is said to give death instantly to
the thirsty one who drinks, of the great pillar of gold,
within which they say a spirit dwells imprisoned,
which cries out for help to all who pass, or rather to
the one who passes now and again in the course of
long years. I have thought of the mystic tree,
which stands alone in the desert, on every leaf of
which there is a word written in blood. I have
thought of these things, strange enough in themselves,
and land-marks by the way, but I know not
how to tell you to go from one to the other. I suppose
if you are to reach your journeys end
the Master will find you some mode of guidance."</p>

<p>"Did he give you guidance?" asked Julian.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the ambassador.</p>

<!-- page 100 -->

<p>"And what was it, who was it?" asked Julian,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you," replied Ki-Chan, with a look
of awful fear coming on his face, "don't ask me to
speak of it."</p>

<p>"Well, suppose I have passed all these things and
found my way, still I want to know how shall I
guess that I need go no further."</p>

<p>Ki-Chan began to speak in a very quiet voice, very
quickly. "The Mahatma Morial dwells in a beautiful
house in the most lovely spot on the whole world.
It is like Paradise, full of sweet air and flowers, and
everything delightful. There is grass, there are
trees, there is water, and all more beautiful than any
you have ever seen."</p>

<p>"Then I shall easily recognise this place," said
Julian.</p>

<p>"If you are allowed to see it," answered Ki-Chan,
in the same low, awestruck voice. "But when the
Master does not choose to let it be seen by some
poor wretch who has fought with hardship and
danger in order to try and reach it, he simply veils
it in a magic mist and it becomes invisible."</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 101 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> strange conversation between these two lasted
until dawn, but at last fatigue compelled them to
rest, and the ambassador dismissed Julian with a
promise that he should be sent on his way as early
in the day as was possible. He kept him as his
own guest, and gave him one of the little guest-rooms
in the house occupied by his followers.
Julian fell asleep from utter weariness, although he
was in a state of great excitement. It was a deep
and contented sleep that came to him; he felt that
he was being taken care of, and that he was really
accomplishing his difficult task. He did not awake
until the ambassador himself came to rouse him.
"My friend," said he, "you have so much fatigue
before you that I let you rest as long as possible.
Rise now and breakfast. Your escort is ready, and
the animals are waiting at the door."</p>

<p>A breakfast was brought in to Julian, which was

<!-- page 102 -->

an odd mixture of Chinese and Tibetan diet. He
rather preferred to the Chinese dishes some rolls sent
him by the Lamas, stuffed with sugar and meat.
They also sent him a great jug of the buttered tea
which is the one drink of the country. Julian began
to think it really very nice, but he altered his opinion
later on, when compelled to drink it in its primitive
state day after day in the desert. This was the delicious
buttered tea of a rich Lamasery. As soon as
he was ready, the ambassador and secretary escorted
him out of the guests' building into the narrow lanes
that ran between the houses forming the Lamasery.
The Lamas were standing on every side, waiting to
see him depart. Evidently all the circumstances of
his arrival and departure aroused the greatest interest
and curiosity among the Lamas and the Chinese
retinue. This of course was not surprising as no
one but himself and the ambassador knew the meaning
of his journey. They passed, as they walked, a
yard full of the great Tibetan dogs who howled
furiously. Julian, who knew what these animals
were kept for, looked at them half with admiration
and half with a shudder of thankfulness to think

<!-- page 103 -->

that his body had not been thrown to them to form
a meal this day instead of his being allowed to
depart in safety. A little lower down was the place
where the animals stood ready for his journey. They
were a number of rough long-haired yaks, the strong
bulls of the country. Half a dozen Chinese soldiers
and half a dozen of the Lamas from the monastery
constituted his escort. Julian was placed upon the
yak which was to carry him, and the others, mounting,
immediately surrounded him, and in this manner
they started. The ambassador coming up to him for
a second, said in a low voice, "Be of good courage,
my friend;" but Julian saw that he was afraid to
speak before the others. He contented himself,
therefore, with giving him a hearty farewell. The
strange little cavalcade started with considerable
difficulty, for yaks do not like being driven, and take
some little time to get into order.</p>

<p>For many days, the journey, although intensely
interesting to Julian, was, comparatively speaking,
eventless. They wended their way in among the
hills, over grassy slopes at their base, making the
journey as smooth as possible as long as this could

<!-- page 104 -->

be done. It seemed to him dull and weary work
riding these bulls, which take so much longer getting
over the ground than either camels or horses, and
once or twice he observed to the leader of the Chinese
guard, who always rode beside him, that it would
have been much better to have used any other
animals.</p>

<p>"Wait," said the Chinaman, "till we get to the
Burkhan Bota. If we had camels with us we should
only leave them as corpses on that pass, and horses
are perfectly useless when we come to making the
descent."</p>

<p>Julian made no inquiries as to the horrors which
lay before them. He thought he should find out
quite soon enough what they were like.</p>

<p>The time passed without his being able to keep any
record of it. Night and day succeeded each other,
and that was all he knew. He was unable to ascertain
exactly how long this journey took, not having
taken the precaution of making notes of the nights
and days that passed from the commencement. It
was certainly some twenty days, but it may have
been more, before they sighted a tremendous range

<!-- page 105 -->

of mountains, which the Chinaman told him was
the Burkhan Bota. And he explained to him the
quaint meaning of this name. Burkhan is the Mongol
for Buddha, and the Abb&eacute; Huc's interpretation of the
name, which he gives in his travels, is the one commonly
accepted by the Chinese, and is simply
"Buddha's kitchen."</p>

<p>"What in the world does it mean?" said Julian.</p>

<p>The Chinaman explained to him that this name,
which sounded so funny, was really very ominous,
as it originated in the mephitic gases which rise all
over these mountains, and which make it a terrible
task for anything living to cross them. However,
it had to be done if Julian wanted to enter Hither
Tibet. They reached at sundown one day the foot
of the nearest of these mountains. The pass, as it was
called by courtesy, lay across this. Julian looked up
in the dim light and saw that some twenty miles of
climbing lay before them on the morrow. He desired
very much to sketch the outline of these most
barren and ghoul-like mountains, which appeared to
him to express in their shapes the very abstract idea
of desolation. But he was too weary and worn out,

<!-- page 106 -->

and resolved that he would make a sketch when they
reached the plains on the other side. There is very
little choice on such a journey as this as to whether
one will work on arriving at the end of a day's travel,
or sleep, for sleep comes suddenly like a trance.
Julian had only a blanket of felt for his bed, laid upon
the ice-cold ground, but, nevertheless, he slept every
night with a deepness which he had never before
thought possible.</p>

<p>A start was made the very next morning directly
after dawn. Evidently his escort looked forward
with much dismay to the next part of the journey.
Julian was at first so fascinated by the barrenness
of the scene that he forgot everything else in contemplating
it. The slopes which the yaks slowly and
patiently climbed were of clay, out of which rose
great rocks of porphyry. No vegetation was to
be seen anywhere, except some small bushes of
yellow kurile tea. There was very little snow, which
is a peculiar feature of this range. A warm wind
from the South plains passing over it continually
drives the snow even from the heights. Julian thought
when he saw these hills without the familiar snow-cap,

<!-- page 107 -->

that there would be very little hardship, comparatively
speaking, in crossing them, and the ascent
too was exceedingly gradual. But in a very little
while a strange feeling came over the whole party.
The animals staggered and swayed as they walked,
and Julian began to have a strange sensation of acute
headache and intense languor. Soon a feeling as if
he could not draw another breath came upon him.
"It is impossible to go on," he said, "unless we rest.
I am too tired."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said the Chinaman, "you are not tired.
We are in Buddhas kitchen. We must suffer the discomfort
of crossing over the vapours which rise from
his cookery. Now you may be glad that Ki-Chan
had sense enough not to send us upon camels, for they
cannot breathe at all in this terrible air." The exertion
of movement became each moment more intolerable,
and Julian looked in surprise at the dogged
obstinacy with which the others urged on their animals,
and slowly continued the ascent. Once or
twice he begged them to pause, but these men, accustomed
to the hardships of the country, knew very well
that if they paused, they would never go on again.

<!-- page 108 -->

No doubt, if he had been the only person whom they
had to please, they would have turned back at once;
but, as a matter of fact, they knew very well that
they could not return&mdash;either the Lamas or the soldiers&mdash;without
having fulfilled their orders of taking
him a certain distance into the interior of the country.
The fatigue and giddiness which overpowered him
became so great that when they neared the summit,
he was unable even to appreciate the scene. In the
whole string, five isolated peaks only were crowned
with snow, all the others were barren alike of this
mantle and of anything softening either of verdure or
coloured earth. The scene resembled what one imagines
the dead side of the moon must look like.
They had to camp in this exhausting atmosphere,
being perfectly unable to continue marching, and
Julian when he thought of his journey afterwards,
concluded that the night he passed here was the most
dreadful experience of all, for although he lay down
on his accustomed bed the fatigue he suffered was of
such an extraordinary character that sleep for the first
and only time deserted him altogether. He had a
sense as if he was not upon the earth, as if he was

<!-- page 109 -->

being carried through the air, and a dreadful terror
oppressed him&mdash;the kind of terror that we suffer in a
nightmare when experiencing one of our dream
journeys. It appeared to him as if the air he breathed
must be full of carbolic acid or some other noxious
gas. This could not be, as a matter of fact, in spite
of the dreadful sensations he experienced, or else he
must have been dead before the morning. The descent
on the other side of the mountain was comparatively
easy on yaks, especially as every yard they
traversed took them further out of Buddha's kitchen.
The animals recovered some spirit, and riding them
became less of a torment; but, nevertheless, the
journey which lay before them was enough to intimidate
the boldest soul. The vast desert stretched
right away as far as the eye could see in every direction,
a hideous desert of clay and sand, with an
efflorescence of salt upon it here and there, as white
as a snowdrift. No vegetation was to be seen, but a
tuft occasionally of a grey lichen and a little grass,
growing about half a foot high, and so parched by
the constant wind that it fell to powder when touched.
Yet the animals attempted to eat this dreadful stuff,

<!-- page 110 -->

and Julian pitied them; but on such a pilgrimage as
this the very capacity to pity dies out in time. One
grows accustomed to see the creatures fail every now
and then from sheer exhaustion and hunger.</p>

<p>When they came to their second halt in this dreary
scene, Julian had recovered a little from his extreme
exhaustion, and he determined to seize the first opportunity
of making a sketch of the outlines of Buddha's
kitchen. He was too tired at night, but resolved to
rise early and make a sketch in the morning before
they started. This he did, and while the felt tent
which they slept under was being taken down and
packed up, and the animals got ready, he went a
little way from the others and took out his sketch-book.
It was the first time he had done anything of
this sort since he had started, and it delighted him to
feel his pencil in hand once again. He worked on
very busily, anxious to complete his task before he
was called to mount, as he knew he could not delay
the start even a few moments. One can imagine his
surprise, therefore, when on looking up he saw that
he was surrounded by the Lamas, who had all left
their animals standing in order to observe what he

<!-- page 111 -->

was doing. A second glance at the silent group
round him showed him that they were full of rage, and
that they directed furious glances at him; but it appeared
they had no intention of interrupting his work.
They allowed him to finish it in silence, and then
Julian fastened up his sketch-book and put it back
within his dress with a feeling of great satisfaction.
To his amazement the moment he had done this he
was seized by one of the Lamas and another took off
the scarf or khata that he wore and bound Julian's
arms so that he could not move. Having bound him
up very safely the Lamas withdrew from him again
and formed a circle around him. Julian looked about
for his Chinese escort and saw that these were all
mounted and ready to start. Presently the leader
observing this group, which showed no signs of getting
ready, goaded his yak and rode up to them.
Before he could speak Julian addressed him.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" he said.</p>

<p>The Chinaman spoke to the Lamas in Tibetan
and one of them answered him in a few sullen words.
The Chinaman seemed greatly disconcerted and
startled at the answer he received.</p>

<!-- page 112 -->

<p>He dismounted and entering the circle came up to
Julian. "Is it true," he said, "that you have been
making a map of the country?"</p>

<p>Julian looked at him in surprise. "A map," he
said, "no; I have been sketching the mountains."</p>

<p>The Chinaman shook his head. "I don't know
what you mean," he answered. "The Lamas have
been telling me that you have been drawing, in a
book which you carry inside your dress, a map of
the country. If this is so I cannot save you. They
have always wished you to be killed, believing you
to be an English spy, drawing maps for the use of
the English army. Ki-Chan knew that this was so;
only because of his lofty position did they release
you, but now they say that they have proof positive
that what they suspected you of is true. Their dread
of the English is something extraordinary. If this
is so, these men will kill you, and I have no means
of saving you."</p>

<p>"What am I to do?" said Julian.</p>

<p>"Let me see," said the Chinaman, "what this
drawing is you have made."</p>

<p>"Take the chain that is round my neck," said

<!-- page 113 -->

Julian, "and you will pull out the book from my
dress; it is attached to it."</p>

<p>The Chinaman did so, drew out the sketch-book,
and opened it. When he saw Julian's sketch, he
gave a little cry of dismay, and a low ominous murmur
came from the Lamas.</p>

<p>"Your fate is sealed," said the Chinaman. "They
will kill you. How could you be so mad as to expose
yourself to this danger?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning after this curious experience of hers,
Daphne was quite worn out with the excitement and
the hours of thinking which she had devoted to the
difficult position she was placed in. It was evident
to her that some great power was at work in her life
for which she could not account, and yet she could
not render up her judgment altogether, because she
was too sensible to be entirely credulous. Nevertheless,
the sign she had seen appeared to her so
strange and so inexplicable that she felt she had no
choice but to obey it. There was nothing to be done
but watch and wait till she understood the meaning
of the mysterious words. She was so little disposed
to talk to Miss Riga or to any of the members of the
fraternity, who might be in the house, that she did
not leave her room until the middle of the day. The
consequence was that a little before noon, Miss Riga

<!-- page 115 -->

came to look for her, carrying in her hands some
note-paper of different sizes.</p>

<p>"I want your opinion, Daphne," she said; "you
do not seem to take any interest in what is going
on."</p>

<p>"Indeed I do, auntie," replied Daphne, "but there
is so much! I am tired of thinking!"</p>

<p>"Don't stay to think, child," said Miss Riga;
"there is so much to <i>do</i>, that there is no time to think;
we have real work before us now. Two nights ago I
had an order to get this special stamp ready for use.
I want you to tell me what you think of it, and which
of these specimens you like best."</p>

<p>With this matter-of-fact remark Miss Riga handed
to Daphne some sheets of paper of different sizes
and styles, and on all of them there was at the head
a double triangle with the points downwards,
stamped in crimson ink.</p>

<p>Daphne said nothing, but remained gazing at the
paper as if petrified.</p>

<p>After a moment Miss Riga noticed this and said,
"Why, Daphne, are you ill? What is the matter?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing the matter," said Daphne, with

<!-- page 116 -->

an effort, "only there is something very strange
going on. I, too, have had an order given me about
the Crimson Star!"</p>

<p>"No doubt, no doubt," cried Miss Riga with an
air of great triumph. "You have had an order to
yield it obedience, I feel sure."</p>

<p>"How could you guess that?" exclaimed Daphne,
breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Because I too have had the same order," said
Miss Riga. " 'Tis simple enough. I have yielded
my obedience absolutely. Shall you yield yours?"</p>

<p>As she said this she fixed a curious questioning
gaze on Daphne, but directly the girl looked up the
old lady pretended to be concerned with the stamp
on the note-paper.</p>

<p>"I have no choice," said Daphne, "but to yield
obedience."</p>

<p>She got up from her chair uneasily, and said with
a sigh, "How I wish Julian was here."</p>

<p>"Then you have <i>not</i> yielded obedience," said Miss
Riga emphatically. "The disciple of the true religion
knows no regard, feels no desire, considers
nothing but the Master's will."</p>

<!-- page 117 -->

<p>"How do you know this," said Daphne, pausing
in her walking about the room and looking very
earnestly at her aunt.</p>

<p>"I know it," said Miss Riga with a sudden change
of manner; "I know it because I have been chosen,
and I have had my orders explained to me."</p>

<p>She had dropped the quiet observant manner and
put on one which was very impressive, a manner
which she was wise enough to use only occasionally.
It affected Daphne very much, for she had only heard
her aunt speak in this tone once or twice in her
life.</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause, during which these
two who had known each other so long exchanged
a regard like that of strangers. "What does she
mean?" was in the mind of each. Then Miss Riga
rose abruptly from her chair, holding some of the
stamped paper in her hand. "This star," she said,
"is the same in the Mystic Brotherhood as the
sceptre of royalty is in the world. It has been given
me straight from the Master to use for mystic purposes,
and from every impression of it a mysterious
power emanates. By it I command&mdash;by this I am

<!-- page 118 -->

made the Master here.&mdash;He chooses to give his orders
through me, now that Julian has left us."</p>

<p>The old woman spoke with a curious dignity
an air of dominance and strength&mdash;and she looked
every inch a witch as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Now, child," she said, "I have told you the
position; you have received your order, and if you
mean to obey it, you have to obey me."</p>

<p>Miss Riga then went out of the room, taking the
paper with her, without saying another word.</p>

<p>Daphne remained standing where she was like one
stupefied. After a few moments, a servant came to
the room to tell her that Mr. Gray wished to see
her. She felt quite undecided whether to see him or
not.</p>

<p>"What is the use?" she said to herself; "I cannot
talk to him about these things, and there is
nothing else I care to talk about." And then she
suddenly realised that his cheerful presence would
be a very pleasant relief to the mood she was in.
She therefore said to the servant, who was waiting
for her answer, "Yes, I will come down and speak
to him."</p>

<!-- page 119 -->

<p>Mr. Gray had asked to see her alone, and had
therefore been shown into a little morning-room on
the ground floor of the house. Daphne looked for
him first in the drawing-room, which had now become
a species of chapel, used by night and by day.
Miss Riga was there talking to Mrs. Flite, and evidently
exchanging very confidential remarks, for
they both stopped talking when Daphne looked in.
Mr. Gray, not being there, she went downstairs,
and found him waiting for her in the little room.</p>

<p>"Miss Royal," said he, speaking at once, in an
earnest manner very unusual with him, "I believe I
have taken a liberty in asking to see you alone, but
I have been thinking all night over the extraordinary
occurrences of yesterday evening, and I determined
to speak to you and risk your displeasure. Do you
realise the tremendous pace at which Miss Riga is
setting to work? Do you realise the position she is
placing you in?"</p>

<p>Daphne looked at him, and meeting the troubled
gaze of his honest eyes decided to speak out.</p>

<p>"I think I realise it fully," she said in a low voice,
"but I too have had commands laid on me so

<!-- page 120 -->

strangely that I have no choice but to obey them."</p>

<p>Gray sat looking at her with the most perplexed
expression on his face. "Are you all going mad?"
at last he said.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Daphne, "I am torn between
faith and incredulity." And then she told him of her
experience in the night.</p>

<p>"This is very serious," said Gray, "and I don't
see how you are to get out of it without a strong
hand to help you. Have you any objection to my
becoming a member of the Society, that is, of the
inner circle?"</p>

<p>"I have none," said Daphne, "but I must own
that I doubt whether you will be accepted."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Mr. Gray, stroking his beard.
"Miss Riga does not like me. Never mind, I will
find a way to propitiate her; I won't waste a moment
now that I know you have no objection." He took
up his hat as if to go and then hesitated. "I want
to ask you a business question, Miss Royal, if you
won't resent it."</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Do you know who Julian's heir is?"</p>

<!-- page 121 -->

<p>"I am," said Daphne. "He made a will just
before he went away."</p>

<p>"Merciful powers!" said Mr. Gray, "what a
position&mdash;well, good-bye for the moment, I must go
and prepare my plans."</p>

<p>Daphne returned to her own room lost in thought
and speculation, but very soon she was summoned
downstairs again by the lunch gong.</p>

<p>At the table she found Miss Riga and also Mrs.
Flite who had already taken up residence. They
both seemed as if full of some portentous news,
something from which Daphne was excluded. Mrs.
Flite was much given to chattering, but now she was
quite solemn and silent.</p>

<p>"We shall have our rules very soon," remarked
Miss Riga in the midst of a dead pause, "all our
rules for working the Lamasery. Everything, even
diet, is a matter of rule, and in every detail obedience
must be given unquestioningly whether in a small
matter or a large."</p>

<p>Mrs. Flite cast up her eyes and shook her head
from side to side. "Who could refuse it," she said
rapturously, "when taken by the hand as we are,

<!-- page 122 -->

and led on the path to perfection&mdash;honoured are we
to be chosen out of the world&mdash;no self-denial could
be too great, no sacrifice too heavy."</p>

<p>"And yet," said Miss Riga, "there are many
things which it is very hard to bear. It was very
hard to have Julian leave us; suppose Daphne should
be chosen next to go out of the world into those
awful solitudes, could we bear it?"</p>

<p>"Oh! what a dreadful thought," said Mrs. Flite,
applying her lace handkerchief to her eyes. Daphne
had been keeping her gaze riveted upon her plate
waiting in great anxiety for what might come next.
What did come next was enough to startle anybody.
A crimson rose fluttered gently through the air and
descended upon the plate right under her eyes.</p>

<p>Daphne started and pushed back her chair as if
prepared to get up and run away.</p>

<p>"Child!" cried Miss Riga in an excited awestruck
voice, "don't move, the Master must be here. This
is some special message from him."</p>

<p>Nothing further happened, and they all sat silent
looking at this rose, which was a large and very
beautiful one, of the deepest colour.</p>

<!-- page 123 -->

<p>"Take it up," said Miss Riga, "perhaps there is
something inside it."</p>

<p>"I don't want to touch it," said Daphne.</p>

<p>"You ridiculous child," said Miss Riga. "Are
you afraid?"</p>

<p>This was said in such a tone that it stung Daphne.
She put out her hand and took up the rose, and as she
did so a small piece of paper fluttered out from the
petals and fell on the white cloth.</p>

<p>They all sat and looked at it as if it was something
which would bite. Presently Daphne, realising the
absurdity of the situation, picked it up. It was a
very tiny bit of thin paper, and on it was a crimson
star evidently traced by hand. A few words were
written upon it in a very peculiar handwriting.</p>

<p>"What is it, Daphne, may we know?" said Miss
Riga after a few moments of silence and wonder.</p>

<p>Daphne looked up and met her aunt's curious observant
gaze. Miss Riga and Mrs. Flite were both
leaning forward watching her. She handed the paper
across to them. "Read it," she said. "I don't
understand it&mdash;perhaps you do."</p>

<p>"Dear child," said Mrs. Flite, "how is it likely

<!-- page 124 -->

I should understand it if you don't, for to you is
given the direct inspiration; I am only a poor believer,
though a true one."</p>

<p>Miss Riga slowly read out the words written on
the paper:&mdash;<i>If you can be perfectly unselfish and sacrifice
all your life for the great truth, to you will be
given a great mission</i>.</p>

<p>"It is signed 'Morial,' " said Miss Riga&mdash;"signed
by the name of our Master. This is his writing.
Oh! Daphne, what can it be that lies before
you&mdash;how greatly are we honoured in this poor
house!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Flite lifted up her hands and eyes to heaven,
and echoed the sentiment with "How greatly indeed!"</p>

<p>Daphne got up from the table, and, taking the
paper and the rose in her hand, she left the room.
The others followed her immediately, and Mrs. Flite,
putting her hand on her arm as they went upstairs,
drew her into the drawing-room. Daphne had not
intended this&mdash;she wanted to go away alone to think,
but Mrs. Flite would take no excuse.</p>

<p>"You must not shut yourself up, Daphne," she

<!-- page 125 -->

said; with a purring manner. "All this will be too
much for you to bear if you do."</p>

<p>"It is enough to take one's reason away," she
added, giving a deep sigh of ecstacy. Daphne agreed
with her, but did not say so.</p>

<p>Miss Riga had just come into the room after going
upstairs to collect some important papers which she
carried in her hand, when a servant announced Mr.
Water.</p>

<p>"Is this your friend, Mrs. Flite?" asked Miss Riga.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Flite, "it is the Mr. Water I
told you of&mdash;you will find him a precious friend.
He is very earnest, and I am sure that he is inspired.
He does but need the right guidance to be of the
greatest value to the world. I know that he is unselfish
that he would give his life, his time, his money to
the great cause, if once convinced."</p>

<p>"His life will be accepted if he is worthy," said
Miss Riga very solemnly; "but money,&mdash;no one
wants that. Have I not been accepted&mdash;have I not
been honoured by special guidance and direct orders,
and I am poor, obscure, penniless. A miserable
old woman with nothing of her own, dependent on

<!-- page 126 -->

others, dependent upon the charity of those who love
me."</p>

<p>"Oh! Auntie," said Daphne impulsively, "do
not speak like that," for she had never heard her talk
in such a way before.</p>

<p>"But it is true, my dear," said Mrs. Flite, "very
true, for I also, have nothing. I can give nothing
but true service, yet I also have been accepted&mdash;is
it not wonderful?"</p>

<p>By this time Mr. Water had entered the room.
Daphne looked up at him with a faint curiosity. He
was a very fair young man, with large, prominent
eyes; it is difficult to say anything more about his
personal appearance. His manner was both eager
and hesitating, and struck anybody who heard him
speak for the first time as curiously vague. There now
followed a conversation which bewildered Daphne
very much. In spite of the absorbing interest of
the message which she held in her hand, she could
not help listening with a feeling of fascination. Miss
Riga led the conversation, and talked like a priestess
or the teacher of a great school. Something of the
two combined she maintained in her manner. She

<!-- page 127 -->

talked openly and freely of the Master&mdash;Mahatma
Morial&mdash;as of a person with whom she was positively
acquainted. She talked of his intentions&mdash;of his vast
scheme for the reformation of the religions of the
world, and the social life of the world, which he was
initiating. She spoke with awe and humility of their
own modest house being chosen as the starting point,
and themselves as the first disciples and the pioneers!</p>

<p>Daphne had never heard this speech before, although
she had heard Miss Riga deliver some of the
sentiments it contained. She became very familiar
with it afterwards, for it was repeated to every new
inquirer.</p>

<p>When Miss Riga had done talking, Mr. Water
asked very humbly what qualifications were necessary
to enter the fraternity.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Water," said Mrs. Flite, here interrupting
for the first time the conversation, "with your
special gifts and your noble aspirations you have
every qualification. Dear Miss Riga, I only ask you
to look at some of the inspired verses which Mr.
Water has produced."</p>

<p>Mr. Water, blushing with modesty or perhaps

<!-- page 128 -->

pleasure, produced a roll from his pocket&mdash;a ponderous
roll of manuscript&mdash;which he handed to Miss
Riga.</p>

<p>She took it and turned the pages over, just glancing
at them. "These are very wonderful," she
said, "I can see that you have direct inspiration. I
wonder whether our Master can inspire you&mdash;would
you like to try?" Mr. Water blushed more deeply
still, and stammered an unintelligible assent.</p>

<p>Miss Riga rose with great dignity, walked down
the room beckoning Mr. Water to follow her, and unlocked
the doors which hid Julian's portrait of his
Master. Mr. Water trembled visibly as he stood
before this splendid figure and gazed at it. As he
stood like this, Mrs. Flite approached him, and stretching
out one hand, directed it towards him, and uttered
the word "Sleep." He turned his eyes helplessly
towards her, and she, taking him by the arm,
led him to a chair, into which he sank.</p>

<p>"What a wonderful subject!" exclaimed Miss
Riga in a whisper. "Oh wonderful!" said Mrs.
Flite, in the same tone; "you can have no idea what
he is!"</p>

<!-- page 129 -->

<p>She took a paper and pencil and placed them in
his hands. Very soon he began to write in a helpless,
mechanical way, and after covering one or two
pages, sank back in the chair as if exhausted. The
two old ladies snatched up the pages as they fell,
and read them with whispered ejaculations of awe
and wonder. Presently Mrs. Flite awoke him with
some of the "reverse passes," as the mesmerists call
them. He looked round blankly and anxiously.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" he said.</p>

<p>Miss Riga put her hand on his arm and said very
solemnly, "I think you will be accepted. I shall
call a special meeting to-night at eight o'clock&mdash;if
you will be here then, I will give you your answer."</p>

<p>The young man felt that he had received his dismissal,
and, dazed though he was, found his hat and took
her departure. Daphne was about to rouse herself
and ask some questions, when another visitor was
announced, who must have met Mr. Water on the
stairs. This was Mr. Gray.</p>

<p>With a passing glance of intelligence at Daphne,
he went direct to Miss Riga, and said briefly enough

<!-- page 130 -->

that he wished to see her alone. Miss Riga took
him away with her. She returned in about a quarter
of an hour, looking very pleased and contented.
During her absence, Mrs. Flite had been maintaining
a species of cooing soliloquy, Daphne meantime
sitting still lost in thought, and forgetting to answer
her. Miss Riga came up and took her seat between
them.</p>

<p>"Another serious candidate already&mdash;Mr. Gray
has asked to join us." This interested Daphne.</p>

<p>"Shall you accept him, Auntie?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I!" said Miss Riga; "it does not lie with me.
I have to ask the Master for him as well as for Mr.
Water. I have promised them both their answers
to-night. I must go now to my own room and seek
inspiration."</p>

<p>All the rest of that day there was a deep solemnity
over the house. When dinner came, the meal was
conducted as if it was a funeral feast, and Daphne
felt herself growing more sad and depressed with
every passing moment. The atmosphere of solemnity
and mystification was almost more than she
could bear. Immediately after dinner the members

<!-- page 131 -->

of the little lodge arrived; there were only two already
accepted and chosen besides Mrs. Flite, Daphne, and
Miss Riga herself, so that the meeting was soon convened.
Then came Mr. Gray and Mr. Water. Mr.
Water trembled as he crossed the room in front of
the portrait, although it was now concealed behind
locked doors. The easel was dressed like an altar,
with candles lit on each side, and on a little table in
front of it a great bouquet of white flowers. This
last, it appeared later in the evening, had been sent
as a humble offering by Mr. Water. He trembled
at the very sight of his own offering in so august a
place.</p>

<p>Miss Riga immediately went to business with all
the dignity of the Grand Master of a Freemasons'
Lodge. She made her preliminary speech, which
was much the same as that of the evening before,
and she then announced, in the most solemn manner,
that Mr. Water and Mr. Gray were both accepted.</p>

<p>"We have now a good working body. With a
strong band of outside workers under us, we are
enough to influence the whole world. Great work

<!-- page 132 -->

has been begun already&mdash;Mr. Water is evidently
one of those pure, translucent mediums that can be
used by the Master without difficulty.</p>

<p>"The first few pages of a book which shall revolutionise
thought and change the whole aspect of
religious life, have already been written by his pen,
under the influence of the Master's portrait. This
book is to be a history of the world since the first
thought of it dawned in the mind of the Infinite!"</p>

<p>"Oh! how wonderful!" ejaculated Mrs. Flite;
"how marvellously are we honoured!"</p>

<p>"Honoured indeed!" said Miss Riga; "we are
chosen, that is more! We shall have to suffer&mdash;we
shall have to sacrifice all&mdash;but, in recompense, we
know that we are chosen. It will be one of the
rules of the Lamasery that wherever we meet for business
or discussion, some little study of the great laws
of occult life, as our Master will give them to us, shall
always be done, for we have much to learn. We
cannot do better than study this book which is to be
written through Mr. Water's mediumship, as it is being
produced," To this there was a universal murmur of
assent.</p>

<!-- page 133 -->

<p>"Let us begin at once, then," she said and, taking
up the papers, she handed them to Mrs. Flite, asking
her to read aloud. This the lady did in a high-pitched,
monotonous voice.</p>

<p>"In the beginning of all things there was nothing.</p>

<p>"There was less than nothing, for there was no
mind to realise the nothingness.</p>

<p>"In the beginning there was not chaos, for there
was no consciousness with which to know there was
no chaos.</p>

<p>"In the beginning there was neither light nor dark
nor heat nor cold nor shape nor form.</p>

<p>"Nor yet was there any knowledge that these
things were not.</p>

<p>"In the beginning there was not the spirit of the
world, which has created and built it up.</p>

<p>"Nor was there any intelligence to know that this
spirit was not.</p>

<p>"In the beginning there was neither sun nor moon
nor stars.</p>

<p>"Nor was there any fire, nor anything of which
chaos could be made.</p>

<!-- page 134 -->

<p>"In the beginning there was neither movement
nor stillness.</p>

<p>"Nor was there anything which could move or be
silent."</p>

<p>Mrs. Flite paused from want of breath. The company
sat still, as though overcome by awe. In the
midst of this religious silence, Mr. Gray's voice was
heard. "Dear me!" he said, "where was Moses
when the light went out?"</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 135 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Julian Arundel</span> looked around and saw no succour.
He gave himself up for lost this time&mdash;there
appeared to be no hope whatever.</p>

<p>The Lamas were not only hostile but terribly enraged.
One glance at their faces showed him that
intercession even of the most powerful sort would
be useless with them, and now his Chinese friend
acknowledged himself helpless. When Julian looked
round he noticed the other Chinamen, standing together
and observing the scene with great interest,
and then a doubt crossed his mind whether, as a
matter of fact, these Chinese were not just as hostile
to him as the Tibetans, and simply playing into their
hands.</p>

<p>This awful doubt cast out the last vestige of
hope.</p>

<!-- page 136 -->

<p>Mechanically, rather than with any object, he
glanced round the horizon. Nothing but desert.
Nothing but sand and clay except in one direction,
where the high peaks of the Koiran mountains were
visible against the sky. What use was it to look
round on such a scene as this with any hope of help?
But as Julian looked, his attention was for a moment
attracted by what appeared to be a black speck moving
rapidly towards them across the desert. His
sight was sufficiently practised now to tell him that
this was a horseman. Only for a moment did he feel
any interest in the circumstance, and then it was
such an interest as a dying man feels in watching
the movements of a fly. A horseman in this desert
could be nothing to him&mdash;a native mountaineer, or,
perhaps, one of the terrible Kolas.</p>

<p>His eyes came back to study the faces of the crowd
that watched him. His doom was written there.
The word "Death" was as clearly conveyed by
their glances as if spoken. All that remained to him
was to know of what character that death was to be.
He expected torture, and he knew that an European's
imagination in such matters is weak. He

<!-- page 137 -->

tried to check this dreadful train of conjecture, and
having resigned himself to the fact that his pilgrimage
was over, that he would never cross that desert,
and never learn what he came to know, his mind
reverted to thoughts of Daphne and of home. His
head drooped on his breast and he stood there silent
and motionless, hardly conscious of the ominous
murmur of the voices of the men around him.</p>

<p>They were arranging or discussing some detail
evidently, and he thought it was lucky that he could
not understand their discussion. He determined to
die like a stoic, and think as little about it as possible.
Ah, but Daphne would never know,&mdash;would
never know,&mdash;that hurt him most of all. She would
never know how far he had fought, and how much
he had suffered. His head drooped lower, and the
scene he was in faded right away from his sight.
He was back in his studio with Daphne.</p>

<p>Suddenly he was startled, and roused out of this
sad reverie by a tremendous thundering sound. It
was the noise made by a great horse approaching at
full speed. He did not trouble to raise his head
even, so completely was he occupied in facing his

<!-- page 138 -->

fate,&mdash;another enemy made but little difference to
him now!</p>

<p>The furious rider dashed straight up to the group
and into its centre, the men all backing right and left
away from the hoofs of the great horse. It was an
immense creature&mdash;black, and fire seemed to come
from its nostrils. Julian's artistic eye noticed the
size and beauty of the horse in spite of his trouble,
for it was brought to a standstill right in front of
him. What a size it was! It seemed to fill the sky.</p>

<p>The others all shrank back terrified, but Julian
stood still. In an instant something inexplicable
happened. Before he had time to realise that the
horse had a rider, he was snatched up as a child
might be, by a hand that gripped like iron, and found
that he was himself upon this horse. He knew not
who else rode it, or who guided it, for it was carrying
him across the desert at the same terrific speed
at which it had come. He was blinded, breathless,
helpless, only able to cling to the long thick mane,
and keep his seat. There was some one sitting behind
him, that he well knew, but it was impossible
to look round. His sight was blurred and bewildered

<!-- page 139 -->

by the tremendous rapidity of the pace at which
they went. It seemed to him that no animal ever
bred to the desert could keep up such a pace as this.
Surely it was not natural!</p>

<p>They fled across the great expanse straight in the
direction of those mountain peaks, which he had
so long looked at with weary desire, and which now
seemed to come visibly nearer with every moment
of this extraordinary flight.</p>

<p>Was this thing a horse on which he rode? he
asked himself, or was it some great bird;&mdash;or was he
dreaming? At last, strong though he was, nature
gave way, and he swooned on the neck of the great
horse as a woman might have done; but he did not
fall. He was held in his place by a strong hand.
A great blank of unconsciousness followed. He
fancied afterwards that he came to life once or twice
during this dream-like flight, falling back again into
a stupor. He remembered vague glimpses of some
strange experience, such a one as comes to us in
delirium.</p>

<p>When he woke to any clear knowledge of life he
was lying down in great comfort on soft pillows,

<!-- page 140 -->

but he was not indoors. His wakening faculties
soon told him that. He looked up into a low canopy
of embroidered cloth and fine woven curtains
were drawn round him. He was being carried, and
after a little while he recognised the movement, and
knew that he was in a litter. He was resting&mdash;he
was refreshed&mdash;he could feel that he had been taken
care of, and that some cordial had been given to him
to restore his strength. He was profoundly comfortable,
and these curtains so prettily embroidered with
an arabesque of flowers shut him in from all the
world. He conjectured from the slant of the litter
that he was being carried up a very steep incline.</p>

<p>A fever of curiosity rose in his mind. "Where
can I be?&mdash;what can have happened to me?" he
kept saying to himself, and then he longed to draw
the curtains apart and look through. And then he
dreaded to do so, and the dread was so much greater
than the longing that he lay still&mdash;he knew not how
long&mdash;it seemed to him for hours&mdash;without making
any efforts to satisfy his curiosity. But at last
the longing conquered, and very cautiously he raised
one hand and drew back one of the curtains a

<!-- page 141 -->

very little. All that he saw at first was that he had
left the desert, and that he was being taken up a
very difficult pass. "What mountains are we crossing?"
he asked himself in the greatest perplexity
of mind, "surely I am not being taken back again.
No&mdash;this vegetation is new, I see some tiny shrubs!"
When he saw these little plants his heart gave a
leap of delight, for he knew that he was not being
carried back across the dreadful Buddha's Kitchen,
where nothing but parched grass grows anywhere.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;this was something different. Was it possible
that he was being carried across the Koiran
Mountains? If so, he was indeed helped on his way
beyond his wildest hopes! But who was doing this?
Into whose hands had he fallen?"</p>

<p>When he came to this conjecture he tried to look
through the curtains more fully, though very cautiously,
to see who his bearers were. A glimpse of
them showed him that their aspect would not enlighten
him in any way. Evidently they were simply
native mountaineers, peasant Tibetans of the shepherd
order, who are accustomed to climb the passes
just as the goats and the yaks are.</p>

<!-- page 142 -->

<p>He sank back on his pillows more exhausted with
thought and perplexity than with the fatigues of his
strange journey. He determined that his best course
was to keep still until some event should take place.
Very soon something did happen. A halt was called,
and as soon as the litter had been put down, some
one came and drew apart the curtains. Julian lifted
himself upon his elbow, and looked with intense
eagerness at the figure which stood there.</p>

<p>It was tall and commanding, the figure of a warrior,
but the face was hidden&mdash;hidden by a mask.
Julian felt more terror at the sight of this mask than
he had experienced during any of his previous adventures,
for he knew not what it meant. Who was
it that was thus silently regarding him? After a moment
of this silent inspection, the figure turned to
some one standing by, and putting out one hand took
a glass, which he then offered to Julian.</p>

<p>Julian lay still, half hesitating; he remained gazing
at the figure, and then at the glass and the hand&mdash;such
a beautiful hand he had never seen before! It
had not the special beauty of a woman's hand because
it was so full of strength, but it was more exquisitely

<!-- page 143 -->

shaped than any woman's he had ever seen; and in
this hand was held a glass, of a kind which he had
never seen before or ever heard of. Its shape was as
exquisite as that of the hand which held it, and it was
so thin that the golden liquid within it seemed like a
sunbeam unconfined.</p>

<p>Julian understood after a moment that he was to
drink this&mdash;this sunbeam. He still hesitated&mdash;was
this the refined and subtle manner in which the Tibetans
had chosen to kill him? While he reflected on
this, a strange thing happened&mdash;in the very body of
the liquid flamed out a crimson star. Julian took the
glass instantly, and drained it. It was taken from
him again with something which seemed almost like
a caress, and the subtle magnetism which came from
that touch affected him more than any words could
have done. A chain appeared to have fallen upon
his spirit. It was formed of a delightful series of
sensations&mdash;it might have been a chain of roses, but
yet he knew that it <i>was</i> a chain. He tried to analyse
this feeling, and tried to keep the curtain open, but
his mind sank under the instant influence of the wine&mdash;of
the touch&mdash;he knew not which, and the curtains

<!-- page 144 -->

were drawn together from outside close and firmly.
In what seemed less than a second to him Julian was
again unconscious. This time his sleep, or swoon, or
trance&mdash;he never knew what it was&mdash;may have lasted
a few hours or it may have lasted a few days for all
that he could ever tell. When he tried to recall what
had happened he remembered that it was daybreak
when he made that fatal sketch of Buddha's Kitchen.
When next he was able to take any intelligent survey
of the scene in which he found himself it was the
evening. It did not occur to him just then to wonder
whether it was the evening of the same day, but afterwards
he often speculated as to how many suns he had
lost sight of in crossing the Koiran Mountains. For he
<i>had</i> crossed them. He knew enough of their outlines&mdash;he
had studied them sufficiently, to recognise them,
and when again he looked round he saw a horizon
bounded by them. They hemmed in the landscape
on every side. So amazed was he when he realised
this that he started instantly to his feet and looked
again. Not until he had done this and fully convinced
himself that he was not dreaming, but that what he
saw were the real mountain-peaks did he look down

<!-- page 145 -->

upon the scene close at hand. He drew a deep breath
of amazement. Never even in his wildest fancies had
he pictured anything so beautiful as that which he
now saw!</p>

<p>How he had been brought here&mdash;how he came to
be here alone now&mdash;were things he could not even
stop to puzzle over. He only knew that he was
standing on the green grass of a velvet lawn and that
he must have been lying on it when his consciousness
returned so suddenly. The sun was just setting and
a marvellous rose colour flooded all the sky, while a
golden haze, almost like gold dust, lay across the
valley in which he stood.</p>

<p>For the first few moments of delight he absolutely
forgot himself&mdash;his mission&mdash;everything. Julian
Arundel&mdash;Daphne&mdash;and the Master, were all alike
swept out of his mind by the intense pleasure that he
experienced. A great throb of delight passed through
his whole being as he looked round from side to side
on this wonderful scene. We know something of
what it was like, for Julian stood upon the lawn that
lay outside Morial's home. He looked at the beautiful
surroundings which Morial had gathered about him,

<!-- page 146 -->

but he experienced much more than that. He actually
breathed the same air as Morial, for Morial's power
was so great that he altered the atmosphere in which
he lived.</p>

<p>His first breath of air drawn in the fastness sacred
to Morial gave to Julian the first moment of real
pleasure that he had ever known in all his life. His
only conscious thought was, "Have I ever lived before
this? Am I only just born; and was all that
dreary time a mere nothing? Oh! what a marvellous
thing is life if this be it."</p>

<p>And yet Julian had the advantage of being a strong
man who could enjoy all the ordinary pleasures of
life, and of having the high-strung artistic temperament
to give him keen enjoyment as well. He had
always supposed that he was one of those specially
gifted to enjoy, but this awakening in Morial's garden
showed him that he had been, as it were, asleep
hitherto. He found, moreover, every sense intensified.
He could not tell whether it was in the intrinsic
beauty of the scene or in his keener faculty that the
delight lay which he found in looking round him.
"If I were to die now," he thought to himself, "I

<!-- page 147 -->

would willingly take all the suffering I have been
through for the sake of these few moments!"</p>

<p>A wakening curiosity led him to turn round and
look behind him. A great rock formed the background,
rising straight up into the sky. Against its
darkness stood out the beautiful flowering trees which
sheltered Morial's home.</p>

<p>Only a little way across the velvet grass Julian
could see an open door framed with a perfect wreath
of tropical flowering creepers. The sight of this
struck him with amazement. He could see through
the doorway that it admitted immediately into a large
room. This room was lit by a very soft silvery light,
and moreover, the rays from the setting sun fell across
the threshold. He could see that it was furnished in
the greatest luxury and with every sign of what we
usually call civilisation. A table near the window
was covered with books and papers. Further back
in the room he could dimly see another table laid as
for a meal, spread with a white cloth lace-edged,
glittering with glass and silver and brilliant with
flowers. Great divans heaped with silken cushions

<!-- page 148 -->

went round the walls, and above them the walls
were lined with books.</p>

<p>Julian stood transfixed with amazement as he
studied these details. What a hermitage was this to
chance upon in a savage country! Surely, it must
be a dream&mdash;a mirage. Presently he saw something
move across the room, coming from far back in it,
and approaching the door. Nothing human this&mdash;and,
as he recognised instantly, something terribly
savage! With a stealthy movement it came out and
stood on the threshold, and then Julian saw that it
was a panther.</p>

<p>While the creature stood there he waited once
again for his fate. To move was useless.</p>

<p>He knew that if it sprang on him he could not
escape.</p>

<p>It <i>did</i> spring, and there flashed across him that
moment of excitement amounting almost to unconsciousness
in which a man gives himself up for lost
and yet determines to fight hard for his life.</p>

<p>But simultaneously with the panther's bound came
the sound of a voice.</p>

<p>"Edon&eacute;!" cried this voice. That was all&mdash;but

<!-- page 149 -->

the tone of command was enough. The creature
crouched and drew back, and Julian stood breathless,
but at ease again, knowing he was saved.
Something else crossed the room in the same direction
as that in which the panther had come. It was
a human figure this time. A young man dressed
simply in the ordinary blue robe with which Julian was
now familiarised, came to the window and stepped
out on to the grass. He raised his hand as he passed
the panther and it shrank away from him. He approached
Julian, coming quite close to him, and
with a smile addressed him immediately in English.</p>

<p>"I am afraid Edon&eacute; startled you," he said, "but
you need never fear him again now."</p>

<p>Julian was very much more startled by this apparition
than he was by that of the panther.</p>

<p>He saw before him a young man of his own age,
of the most wonderful beauty, and with the most
charming manner.</p>

<p>That was all he realised in the first moment, and
he tried to speak and answer this friendly address
in his own language which was the very last he expected
to hear spoken, but found his powers of

<!-- page 150 -->

speech failed him. He was overcome by a sensation
perfectly new to him&mdash;a sense of attraction, so
strong that it seemed to pull his very heart-strings,
drew him towards this wonderful being&mdash;a feeling of
devotion inexplicable because it sprang so instantly
into life&mdash;seized upon him. No woman had ever
affected him like this. His love for Daphne was
child's play beside this feeling. He wanted to fall
on his knees, or do something which to an Englishman
appears absurd, but he controlled himself, and
after a slight pause which appeared nothing more
than that of natural astonishment, he succeeded in
speaking.</p>

<p>"I am more startled by hearing you use my own
language."</p>

<p>"That is very likely, but you must get used to being
surprised here. No doubt you will be astonished,
having come from a very matter-of-fact country
where I believe you are dependent upon the post
and telegraph, to know that I quite expected you,
that you are here as my guest, and that I shall be
very glad if you will come in to supper."</p>

<p>With this speech the young man turned and led

<!-- page 151 -->

the way through the open door into the lighted
room.</p>

<p>Julian looked to the skies and the earth to see if
there were any more miracles about, and then quickly
followed his mysterious host. He did not know
until he entered the room and sat down to the perfectly
appointed table that he was quite tired and
quite hungry. But so he was, and the rest and refreshment
of the beautiful surroundings were most
delightful and cheering. He was very surprised (or
rather that is hardly correct, for his power of being
surprised was worn out; I should rather say he was
very much relieved) to find the supper a delicate
meal, such as an epicure of any nation would appreciate.
This was a great change from the raw meat,
the barley cakes, and the dreadful buttered tea, to
which he had been so long accustomed.</p>

<p>And his host, who talked lightly and easily to him,
just as if they had been two college friends meeting
in his rooms, sat opposite, and poured him out from
time to time wine in a glass like that from which he
had drunk on the journey.</p>

<p>The first time the glass was handed to him he was

<!-- page 152 -->

so wrapt in admiration of the beautiful face opposite
that he did not notice it. The second time his eyes
fell on it he recognised its peculiar shape, and he
recognised also the hand that held it.</p>

<p>This, then, was his masked guide across the mountain!
And the wine, <i>was</i> it wine? or was it fire and
light? It seemed to flash into Julian's brain and
give him new intelligence and new powers. He
could not bring himself to ask any question which
might break the charm of this ideal supper. He
prized the moments which passed by in the delightful
intercourse with this stranger, who entertained
him so royally, who laughed with him like a boy,
and talked of all things in heaven and earth. Well,
if not of all, of strangely many!</p>

<p>It struck Julian suddenly with amazement that this
man, whom he found in the inaccessible fastness of
Tibet, was talking to him of the politics of Europe,
and showed an infinitely greater knowledge of the
events of the day than he himself possessed.</p>

<p>This thought having once entered his mind, he
could not banish it again&mdash;a kind of intellectual terror
seized him and chased away the freshness of his

<!-- page 153 -->

pleasure. A wild craving to solve the mystery of
the place he was in, and the person he talked to took
possession of him. Like everything else he had experienced
since he had been in this strange place,
his emotion was keener than anything he had ever
felt before. It overpowered him&mdash;it was uncontrollable.</p>

<p>He started suddenly from his chair, and stood a
moment looking at the beautiful youth who sat opposite
him with a smile of amusement on his face.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" said Julian, "I cannot rest till I
know. Who are you that talks like this of the affairs
of all the world, though you dwell in a hermitage?
Who are you that talks of men's minds and hearts,
as though you read them?"</p>

<p>"What?" was the answer, uttered with the most
delicate inflection of amused scorn, "what?&mdash;the
disciple with the clairvoyant vision&mdash;the disciple that
can read that which is not written! Can you not
answer your own question?"</p>

<p>Julian leaned across the table and stared at the
brilliant young face which fascinated him as he had
never been fascinated before.</p>

<!-- page 154 -->

<p>"What?" he said, in his turn, "is it you?"</p>

<p>"My name is Morial," said the other, and laughed
his exquisite musical laugh, as he watched Julian's
face.</p>

<p>"Have you not painted my portrait!" he went on,
"do you not recognise your model?"</p>

<p>"I recognise my own incapacity," answered Julian;
"I recognise the blindness of my sight and the
feebleness of my hand! I know you now, but, God!
I never dreamt that a man could have such beauty!
and when I saw you from the other side of the world
I suppose I was half blindfolded."</p>

<p>"That is not altogether the explanation," said
Morial, lightly, getting up from his chair, "partly it
is, but I am in my youngest humour to-night. You
would not have known me at all had you seen me
when I came on my good horse, Agape, to save you
from those murderers; I looked very different then.
Is not Agape a good horse? Did not he carry you
well across the leagues of the desert? Agape is one
of my oldest friends and the next is Edon&eacute;. Imprisoned
souls both. My best prayer for you is that
you may never earn their fate!"</p>

<!-- page 155 -->

<p>Julian did not attempt to understand him.</p>

<p>Morial was moving about the room, and Julian
stood watching his movements, fascinated absolutely
by their beauty, and absorbed in his own amazement.
"I fancied our meeting so different!" he
said. "I have often tried to picture it. I thought I
should fall on my knees and ask you to teach me."</p>

<p>"Well," said Morial, with a laugh, "you wanted
to. Don't doubt yourself; you <i>did</i> recognise me,
but I wished for an hour of amusement. I do not
often entertain a nineteenth-century Englishman in
my hermitage. To speak correctly, I have never
entertained one before. I liked talking to you for a
little while, and let me tell you that I never lose a pleasure
unless a duty compels me to. Life is too precious
to waste the value of one moment of it. Now," he
went on, altering his manner to that easy one of the
host, which he had worn at supper, "you had better
rest. You have had no natural sleep for some
time."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Julian, "I thought I had been in a
strange state."</p>

<p>"Oh! I could never have got you here if you

<!-- page 156 -->

had been awake," said Morial smiling, "you are
such an excitable creature, and an Englishman is so
obstinate. Besides you would have died under the
fatigue. Now, I want you to sleep, but only for
two or three hours. You have come here to work
and to learn, and you must begin your apprenticeship.
I shall rouse you at midnight, when you will
have slept off the effects of the long journey and all
this excitement. I must preserve your physique, it
is a fine one, and youth is more valuable than gold
or learning in the path you have chosen. Come."</p>

<p>He lifted a curtain and went through an archway
and Julian followed him, much too bewildered to be
anything but submissive. The corridor they entered
was full of the same silvery light as the room they
had been in. The impression produced on Julian's
mind was that they were in a great house. He had
just sense enough to be surprised at this, because on
the outside the house had appeared very small. He
knew afterwards that most of it actually lay within
the rock, and he found out, but this not until long
afterwards, that the room he rested in was within
the rock and just below the hall in which the great

<!-- page 157 -->

crystal hung. His bed was actually beneath the
crystal, but to-night there was nothing to make him
guess this. The walls were covered with embroidered
cloths, the floor was hidden by skins. The
dim light which came from no visible lamp, was
pale and soft. The bed struck him with instant admiration.
It was of ivory, and shaped like a boat,
and it swung very lightly as he laid down in it with
a delightful soothing motion. The couch was so
soft that to his tired frame, so long accustomed to
lie on the hard ground, it seemed like a bed of rose
leaves, and it smelled like one too.</p>

<p>But a stronger scent overpowered this fragrance,
the scent of a burning pastille, which faintly filled
the room. It was a different scent from that of the
pastilles of the Lamasery&mdash;more subtle and more intoxicating.
It appeared to him to affect his brain as
the wine had done.</p>

<p>Morial said no "good-night." He led him into
the room, and, with a wave of his hand which
brought upon Julian a deep sense of sleep, turned,
and left him.</p>

<p>What rest that was which came to Julian!&mdash;as delightful&mdash;as

<!-- page 158 -->

full of keen enjoyment as his sensations
when he first woke to life outside Morial's home.</p>

<p>His last thought as he sank off was: "What a
marvellous thing life must be when one has really
learnt to live, if I can find such pleasure as this so
soon!"</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 159 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Julian</span> was awakened by a light touch on his hand&mdash;a
touch as light as the fall of a rose leaf, and yet it
went so straight to his brain that he was wide awake
in an instant. When he fell asleep the light in his
room had been silvery and bright, although very
dim. Now, when he opened his eyes, it was much
stronger, but it had a kind of coppery tinge, like one
sometimes sees in a sunset, but more often in the light
of a fire. That was what first attracted his attention,
but in the next instant his whole mind was occupied
by the figure which stood beside him. He knew
immediately that it was Morial, although without a
certain amount of intuition he would probably not
have recognised him. The face had changed so completely
that it seemed as if one or the other, must be
a mask. The same features were there, but the brilliant
creature of supper-time had given place to a

<!-- page 160 -->

stern and cold ascetic, more than stern and cold,
hard and repellant. A shiver passed through Julian's
frame as he looked at this face, which seemed to be
made of iron. The cold blue eyes looked down on
him with a fixed, steady gaze, which he felt compelled
to answer; he could not look away.</p>

<p>"It is time to rise," said Morial. "Come with
me.</p>

<p>Without hesitation Julian obeyed. How could he
do otherwise with that unwavering gaze fixed upon
him. Wait, you who think it is possible to repel any
such gaze as this, till you have been swayed by a
powerful hypnotist, or taken half out of the track of
reason by some half maniacal soul, that desires to
influence you!</p>

<p>The singular gaze which Morial fixed upon Julian,
brought into his mind immediately that dreadful
thought of insanity. He had only seen such a look
as that once before, and that was in the eyes of an
inmate of a solitary cell at Bedlam. But there was
no resisting it.</p>

<p>He rose quickly out of the ivory couch in which he
lay. Even this had changed its appearance perhaps

<!-- page 161 -->

merely from the change of light, but it no longer
looked so white or so beautiful as when he entered
the room. Morial was dressed in a scarlet robe,
which fell in straight lines from neck to feet. He
carried on his arm another garment of the same
kind which he gave to Julian.</p>

<p>"Put this on," he said. "Come with me."</p>

<p>Julian, who, though he had studied the mysteries
and beauties of colour, had never studied its meanings,
dressed himself in the robe of the Duppa, and
gowned as a novitiate of the Black Order, he followed
his Master in curiosity and awe.</p>

<p>The keen feeling of pleasure which the first meeting
with Morial had given him was gone. He did
not feel now that this man was a friend, as he had
felt a few hours ago. Then it seemed to him as if
he had met the dearest one of all in the world, the one
who would give him the most pleasure, and whom
he could trust absolutely, as he could trust no none
else. All this was gone, the cold glitter of those
steel blue eyes had dissipated the delightful fantasy.
But Julian did not distrust his Master, he only feared
him; he had learned enough of occultation to apprehend

<!-- page 162 -->

that the master is regardless of his pupils welfare
for his own sake, the master's one thought being
the good of the world. What he felt, therefore, as he
followed Morial along the corridor was that now he
had indeed met with his master, one who would
judge him without favour, and compel him to show
all the strength and value of his character.</p>

<p>They went up a long flight of stone stairs, and in
a few moments passing the crouching figure of the
panther, they went together into what we have called
Morial's laboratory. Julian had no conception of
where he was, for the room was perfectly dark, and
from the moment he passed the threshold of the door,
there was no evidence to any of his senses that any
other living was there. He only felt that he was in
darkness and silence. Perhaps this state of things
only lasted a moment, or it may have lasted hours,
it was impossible for him to tell. He had just begun
to feel that he must shriek aloud, not from fear, but
from a horror which this blank darkness brought
upon him, when his attention was arrested by the
sudden appearance of a faint grey cloudiness just in
front of where he stood.</p>

<!-- page 163 -->

<p>Immediately a great contentment took the place of
the horror. If his clairvoyance was to be developed
by this ordeal, then he was well pleased to bear it.
The greyness grew larger; then formed itself into
shapes. Very dim shapes these were at first, but
presently he fancied he could see the pillars and archways
of a great hall. By degrees the outlines became
more definite, and he felt that he was in this
Hall, though only just within the door, still really
within it, and the door was closed behind him.</p>

<p>There was a great altar at the far end, a strange
altar, not decked with flowers nor lit with candles,
and yet offerings were placed there. Shadowy figures
slowly moved towards it through the dimness of the
hall, and put upon it vessels which they carried.
This went on slowly but continuously, and Julian
strained his sight to the utmost to try and understand
what it meant. Presently he saw that all these figures
were blindfolded; more than that, they were
swathed, bound, wrapped, like Egyptian mummies,
with scarcely any freedom, even of the limbs, save
just enough to move with difficulty, and just enough
to carry the vessels which they all bore. They could

<!-- page 164 -->

not see nor hear, nor speak, and it came to him as a
most strange thing, that so completely were they
swathed and bound, that, not any one of them
could guess who their companions were, not even
those who stood on each side of them. What a
mysterious isolation it seemed of the members of the
silent crowd! And what were these vessels that they
all carried? Each one as he with difficulty reached
the altar, lifted his arms and placed the vessel which
he held, upon the very altar itself, and then, after a
moment's pause, turned and moved away in a strange,
wandering, helpless way, like something lost and
without aim.</p>

<p>Some of those who had been to the altar came very
near Julian, and he looked at them with an intense
curiosity. It was useless to speak to them, useless
to touch them; they were more effectually separated
from him and from each other than if they had been
creatures of a different planet. Some power which
was not his own seemed to awaken in Julian. Did
it come from Morial? was he still standing by him?
He did not know, he could not guess, but presently
he found that, not his own volition and with most

<!-- page 165 -->

unexpected ease, he had himself reached the altar.
He stood where he could look into these vessels;
and what was within them? Only a few ashes&mdash;just
a few ashes at the bottom of each. As soon as he
had seen this, a dreadful oppression, a sense of deep
despair came over him, and it seemed as if the place
that he was in was no longer supportable. Immediately,
he appeared to be carried rather than led, to
the doorway. The door was opened and a breath
of more natural air revived him. Morial stood beside
him, still looking at him with that cold, glittering
gaze. Julian feared him now, but his curiosity was
too great for him to remain silent.</p>

<p>"What have I seen," he said; "what were those
ashes?"</p>

<p>"You have seen," said Morial, "the ceremony of
sacrifice. Those ashes are the ashes of the heart.
Each human creature that enters the Great Life, must
first burn out his heart and offer it willingly. That
is what now lies before you. It is useless for me to
ask you whether you are ready, but I shall soon know.
Follow me."</p>

<p>Julian followed his Master, as he called him now

<!-- page 166 -->

in his own mind, as obediently and as mutely as a
dog would have done, but at the same time he was
plunged in profound and terrible thought. What did
this thing mean? He had hoped that the hardship
had quickened, not killed his heart, and he resolved
to wait and try and discover the true meaning of this
mystery before he entered upon it.</p>

<p>Morial took him through a darkened arch-way in
the great room where the crystal hung. There were
many other things in the room to attract attention,
and Julian did not at first notice the great mirror of
the soul. Indeed, he did not realise at all that it was
there, or what it was that he looked at, when at last
he saw it. All he knew was that he was looking
straight into his old studio back in London. How
home-like and how pleasant it looked! It was perfectly
real to him, and the revulsion of feeling, after
the terrible gloom and despair with which the masked
figures he had seen had inspired him, was so keen as
to make him entirely forget his present surroundings.
A figure moved across the studio, and so completely
was he carried away by the illusion that he started
forward and cried out "Daphne," and the figure

<!-- page 167 -->

paused and turned, and Daphne's face was lifted towards
him! Surely she had heard him.</p>

<p>If so, the sound of his voice brought her no pleasure.
A look of anxiety, even of despair, came upon
her face. She was dressed in white, and as Julian
noticed this, and how dark the room was otherwise,
it suddenly struck him that this was the night, and
that Daphne was wandering about the house really as
if she was a ghost.</p>

<p>Why was she so restless, so anxious, so nervous?
And he saw that she looked from side to side as if in
terror at some possible apparition. He uttered her
name again, almost unconsciously, and with the idea
of reassuring her. She started violently, and then
suddenly turned and fled, and the crystal relapsed
into darkness, for it seemed that it was the lamp in
Daphne's hand which had illumined it. How changed
she was! how altered! Julian stood lost in amazement
and distress. Then suddenly he again felt that
light touch which awoke him from his sleep, and,
turning, saw Morial standing by his side.</p>

<p>"It is nothing to you," said Morial, "if that beautiful
girl became mad with trouble or dies of trouble

<!-- page 168 -->

and grief. What should it be to you? There are
many beautiful girls in the world, but in the fierce
fight of the great life they are nothing. They amount
for no more than the midges that buzz round you on
a summer's day; if the life of one of these is snuffed
out, what matters it?"</p>

<p>"What makes you talk like this?" said Julian;
"surely you do not wish me to be heartless? If
Daphne is suffering I must return to her."</p>

<p>"Do so, then, quickly, my friend," said Morial,
"and do not waste my time. That which you have
first to offer on the great altar is the vessel containing
the ashes of your heart. I have shown you
this once very plainly. Make no mistake: the
neophyte sacrifices all that the ordinary man is bound
by; the ordinary limitations of preference or liking
can easily be conquered; but let me tell you that he
who loves is utterly useless in the life which you wish
to enter. We are compassionate, but we cannot
allow ourselves to <i>feel</i>, the stakes at issue are so great
as to enter into the realm of abstractions, and we
should fall from our high duties if we allowed the
thought of any one person or of any number of individuals

<!-- page 169 -->

to affect us. Until you have learned this
lesson it is useless to think of going on."</p>

<p>Having so spoken the Master turned away as if to
attend to something more important than a neophyte's
educational welfare. And he left upon Julian's soul
the same awful sense of dreariness and desolation
which had been given to it by the vision of the Ceremony
of Sacrifice. To his imagination it had always
appeared that the life of the neophyte would be more
intense and much fuller than the life of the ordinary
man, and that the life of the Master would be a glory
of warmth and of love. The keen pleasure which
Morial had imparted to him when first he arrived
seemed to warrant this hope and make it a justifiable
faith, and now this crumbled to ashes.</p>

<p>He remained standing without desire to move, and
thinking deeply over Morial's dreadful words. The
light about him was very dim and grey as his own
thoughts, but suddenly he was startled by a brilliant
flash straight before his eyes. It was in the crystal,
and in a moment the whole of the great mirror was
one glow of light. He did not realise this. All that
he realised was that the light in front of him was his

<!-- page 170 -->

studio again, but lit now as if for a great entertainment.
All the wax candles in the silver sconces,
which he himself had placed upon the walls, were
burning, and soon he saw that the room was full of
people. They did not come in, he did not see them
enter, but they slowly became visible to his sight,
and the walls were lined with chairs, and all the
chairs were filled. And then he saw, too, that the
room was altered. For a long time he could not
understand it. He saw the great archway which had
been opened between the houses. He saw that there
were people in the further room; he saw his portrait
of Morial standing upon an easel in its accustomed
place, but in a new frame and hidden behind locked
doors.</p>

<p>Just when he took in the whole scene, Miss Riga
entered the room, and walking up to the easel unlocked
the doors and showed the splendid portrait of
Morial in his crimson dress. Julian drew his breath
as he looked at it. Yes, that was Morial as he painted
him as he first saw him in the mystic vision, and
that was Morial as he was to-night&mdash;cold, heartless,
cruel, inexorable. But immediately his attention was

<!-- page 171 -->

distracted from the picture by the sound of a voice
which penetrated to his ears. It was Miss Riga's
voice; he recognised it, although it appeared to come
from a great distance and sounded as if carried to
him through a kind of tube! Still, he could hear every
word of it plainly; and he listened in the utmost
amazement to a speech which she delivered standing
there in front of the portrait.</p>

<p>"Surely this is some fantastic dream," he thought
to himself. "This is never Aunt Riga standing there
addressing these people?"</p>

<p>But it was true! and its truth was made clear to
him as he watched this scene.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 172 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER XV.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> stood spellbound, listening to these words uttered
on the other side of the world. To him everything
that was said was perfectly novel, and he could not
understand it. Miss Riga delivered the speech with
which Daphne was now familiarised; just a little
learned and a little elaborated for her larger audience.
Perhaps it would be hard to enlarge the idea of founding
a religion which is to oust Christianity from the
face of the world, but it is not so hard as it seems,
with such a creed as Buddhism to fall back upon,
and this was Miss Riga's position. She was a very
clever woman, and she knew exactly how to use her
opportunities.</p>

<p>Julian listening to her, separated by the surface and
centre of the globe from her actual personality, yet
stood amazed, and indeed appalled by her power.

<!-- page 173 -->

If all she said were true, it was she that was the
Master; if all she said were true, she knew more of
Morial than he did, and yet he was close to the
Master, able to speak to him if he wished. What
could this mean? All these people who sat surrounding
his familiar room were spellbound, listening to
her words. Who were they? What were they? What
had they to do with himself or his mission? It seemed
to him that he ought to interfere, to speak to Miss Riga,
and to tell her that he did not understand her authority
for such words as she uttered, for they were the
words of a high priestess; in fact, in what she said
she absolutely claimed to be this; and how was this?
For when he left London, surely but a short time
ago, Miss Riga had looked upon his mission as the
enterprise of a madman, as the vagary of a half
crazed painter!</p>

<p>She talked and talked, and at last when it seemed
she had said enough (as perhaps she stopped only
for lack of breath, he could not tell which, but at all
events she stopped), she crossed the room and sat
down in her accustomed chair. The people in the
room remained silent for a moment, but soon a dark,

<!-- page 174 -->

tall young man rose, and advancing to the place
Miss Riga had occupied in front of the portrait, addressed
the others. He talked of the Great Life, of
the Higher Life, and the Great Cause, of something
which transcended all ordinary life, and which swallowed
it up absolutely, in what he called a superhuman
motive. Julian listened to him in amazement.
Who was this man who stood and talked like
the master of the house in his studio?</p>

<p>He could not understand it, and this possessiveness,
so characteristic of an Englishman, almost
crowded out of his mind for a moment the consciousness
that the greatest stakes were at issue. He felt
an intense irritation at the idea of a man whom he
had never seen and did not know speaking like one
in authority in his own house. But his thoughts
about this were soon interrupted by something more
vital to the man himself which stirred his whole
being to its depth, and this was the sound of a familiar
voice. It was the voice of his old friend, Arthur
Gray, and how strange was that sound, perhaps more
strange than even the voice of Daphne herself would
have sounded, had he heard it away here in these

<!-- page 175 -->

mysterious surroundings and in the heart of this
extraordinary country into which he had penetrated.</p>

<p>"I should like to ask," said Mr. Gray, "if it is not
being too practical, what definite position we are to
take up in this Christian country? Perhaps Mr.
Foster will kindly answer me, as he seems perfectly
aware of what we are intended to do."</p>

<p>The tall dark young man, who Julian presumed
to be Mr. Foster, looked at Arthur Gray who had
risen from his chair and stood facing him, just as a
panther might look at a lion, or to speak more in
nineteenth-century fashion, as a cat might look at a
dog. He surrendered the position after a moment's
thought by appealing to Miss Riga, and taking refuge
under her standard.</p>

<p>"Madam," he said, addressing her, "this surely
is beyond my powers and scope. Will you please
answer this inquiry if I retire?"</p>

<p>Miss Riga rose to the occasion and looked regal as
she did so, little though she was in person. She had
the peculiar quality which makes the Queen of England
great among monarchs. Our Victoria is a very
little lady, but she looks taller than anybody else on

<!-- page 176 -->

occasions. And so it was with Miss Riga now when
called upon. She grew taller as she rose from her
chair. She seemed to expand and enlarge in her
majesty and dignity.</p>

<p>"The position that we have to assume," said Miss
Riga, facing her audience with perfect confidence,
"in a country which owns Jesus Christ as its Saviour
and teacher is simply this:&mdash;we are the apostles and
disciples of the parent creed. Buddhism is as much
the father of Christianity as the parent is the father
of the child. Christianity is a mere offshoot of that
religion upon which we found our daily lives, in
which we find our aspirations and our hopes. What
we have to do, in fact, is to found a great centre
in London, where the poor creatures who have
hitherto followed a mere off-shoot religion shall become
the children of the great parent stock. In this
centre everything can be learned; here actual truth
can be studied. More than that, here we get the
words of a master of to-day, now living on the earth,
the benefit of his teachings and his guidance."</p>

<p>Julian's amazement at these words can possibly be
better imagined than described. When he had left

<!-- page 177 -->

London Miss Riga had not developed any of these
tendencies. He had not then heard that she even recognised
the Master as a personality with which she
was familiar. How did she come to know anything
of this Master, with whom he himself was practically
a stranger in spite of his terrible journey.</p>

<p>There was a buzzing of general conversation in the
room into which he was looking, and during the distraction
he felt a touch upon his hand&mdash;the magic
touch again. It startled him intensely; it brought
him back from the commonplaces and simplicities of
London life, to the awful reality that he was&mdash;whatever
might be going on in London&mdash;in the deserts of
Tibet alone with this inexplicable creature, the
Mahatma Morial.</p>

<p>Turning, he saw Morial's beautiful brows bent upon
him, full of interest.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "what do you think of this?"</p>

<p>Julian answered his gaze very earnestly. "I
think," he said, "it is both sad and terrible, unless
you will explain to me something that I cannot even
guess at. Tell me has that old woman orders from
you to say these things?"</p>

<!-- page 178 -->

<p>"Indeed, no," said Morial, "I have never communicated
with that creature. She has nothing to
do with me except as a tool that I do not care to
even handle."</p>

<p>"Then how can she speak as she does?" said
Julian, still looking at him fixedly.</p>

<p>"Because," said Morial, "she is a tool and a useful
one."</p>

<p>"But," said Julian, "if you had not communicated
with her she is telling lies."</p>

<p>"Certainly," answered Morial, "she is telling lies,
I am aware of that."</p>

<p>"And you permit it in your name," said Julian.</p>

<p>"I not only permit it," said Morial, "but I approve
it; it saves me a world of trouble."</p>

<p>"Why does Daphne look so sad?" said Julian still
looking at him but not conquering the intense gaze
which he met.</p>

<p>"Daphne looks sad," replied Morial, "because
she has met at last with the realities of life. She is
much better off than if you had married her and made
her happy. She will become a candidate for the
higher life in time, and she may attain eminence

<!-- page 179 -->

before you do, because she has some very high qualities.
Her clairvoyance is extraordinarily pure."</p>

<p>"That may be," said Julian, "but I love her, and
I want to know why she looks so unhappy."</p>

<p>"I take no interest," replied Morial, "in the happiness
or unhappiness of the persons who have become
my instruments. If you wish to enter the life
for which you have become a candidate, you must
conquer these foolish notions. Happiness and unhappiness
are convertible terms. Learn this as the
first truth, and then offer up that heart of yours,
which is at present leaping like a wild beast, at the
great ceremony. When it is done you may perhaps
learn the truth."</p>

<p>He was alone again, Morial had left him, but the
sense of solitude only lasted a second, for again he
saw this crowded room before him, and the eager
faces. "You can tell us the truth," said one. "You
can guide us and tell us what to do," said another,
"and you can order our lives, and tell us what is
right to say, and even to think," said the third;
"why, then, we are your slaves, this is what we have
looked for, what we have waited for!"</p>

<!-- page 180 -->

<p>Julian looking at the scene before him, saw Miss
Riga, whom he had known as an unfortunate and
helpless old woman, surrounded like the high priestess
of a temple, by a crowd of earnest neophytes.
Very earnest were they. They were ready to surrender
their lives or money&mdash;everything, if only they
could know <i>the truth</i>. Watching, Julian went through
a terrible experience, for he found that looking at them
through this crystal medium he could see their very
thoughts, and that they were in earnest in what they
said. What was it to which they rendered their homage?
Was it a true altar or a mock one? How could
he tell after Morial's last words? He had doubted
Miss Riga very naturally, but he had been prepared
to trust his Master. Now everything seemed swept
away from him&mdash;heaven and earth alike. The crystal
clouded and grew dark, and Julian's soul clouded
and grew dark with it. None who have not suffered
as he has suffered, can know the solitude and despair
of that darkness and doubt.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 181 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER XVI.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Very</span> soon after the actual sunrise, indeed as soon as
the sun had reached the valley, Morial threw off the
peculiar garment which he wore during the night,
and, dressed in his blue robe, went out into the air.
His was one of those marvellous faces of which in
every-day life we sometimes see faint reflections, in
which youth appears to grow stronger day by day
instead of age. Nature was to him like a playmate,
and the smile of pleasure always came upon his face
when he threw aside his cares and looked up into the
brilliant sky. He needed no companionship in order
to find pleasure as less perfect mortals do. In the
deep recesses of his mind memory had stored so much
and thought had created so much that no other being
had power to supply him with amusement. Certainly
he had found amusement in the few hours spent with

<!-- page 182 -->

Julian on his first arrival, but that was not found in
Julian himself. He simply used this young Englishman
fresh from the centre of civilisation, to reawaken
by his talk and manner memories of his own life long
ago; for in the far past he had saturated himself with
the intellectual and social life of every country.
There had been a time when he had been very much
what Julian was now, only more intellectually cultured
and with an overpowering knowledge of his
own future and destiny.</p>

<p>That future and that destiny had been so gigantic
and so full of romance that ordinary life was lost
sight of beside it.</p>

<p>Long since had he renounced all the pleasures and
passions of every-day humanity, putting them aside
for something which utterly blotted them out from
his consciousness. But at times it gave him a passing
gleam of amusement to touch on old chords,
and fancy himself a boy again in the old-fashioned
sense. He had immortal youth&mdash;not the transient
youth which has to be snatched and enjoyed before
it flies; but at what a cost had he not obtained it!
what lives had he not sacrificed, what hearts had he

<!-- page 183 -->

not broken, what minds had he not clouded by despair
and insanity!</p>

<p>Going on his way triumphant, a monstrous intellectual
hero, the whole decalogue of crimes, and
even more (for some defied description in words)
had been committed by this exquisitely beautiful
creature who stood here now in the sunshine, greeting
it with as innocent and beautiful a smile as any
saint might have worn. His difficulty (a faint momentary
difficulty which had commenced when the
disciple whom he sent to bring Julian across the
pass of Phari failed) was now conquered. Julian
was in his grasp, and through this man's magnetic
touch with the home and country he had left, Morial
held a telephone agency of the sort he needed.
Julian was, in his eyes, a tool, though not just as
he had called Miss Riga a tool&mdash;this was a very
valuable one, because highly strung, and in connection
with the centre which he desired to touch.
And why did he desire to touch this? Not from a
caprice or a fancy, but because that thing we call
fate, and which is stronger even in the will of a
Mahatma, ordered that at this time knowledge of

<!-- page 184 -->

many strange things should come to the Western
world. An hour of unfoldment had arrived, and
Morial, who well knew that a stronger power than
himself existed, knew that he, too, was a tool just as
were his creatures; but he had learned the supreme
art of wresting from fate fruition and reward for himself.
He intended to hold the reins of this Western
development, and not to permit the opposing power
which continually met him through all his hitherto
triumphant life, to take from him this great opportunity.
Power was to him the one good, the one
desirable thing, and he worked for that, to increase
it and maintain it, as some work for a great cause
and others for a selfish one.</p>

<p>For perhaps two hours of the fresh, dewy morning,
Morial wandered about in his garden, perfectly
happy in the pleasure of the movement, and taking
the perfect rest which he had learned to obtain at
will. But at last he was disturbed. A faint sound
reached his ear, like the tinkling of a very sweet,
silvery bell. He started, and paused, and then in a
moment the mystic change came over him, which

<!-- page 185 -->

transformed him from a beautiful youth to the mysterious
being we call a magician.</p>

<p>In all this world there were but two other minds
with which Morial the Mahatma ever held what we
call conversation, only two other minds ever approached
the level of his own, and these were the
minds of men who had lived his own life, and who
now had secluded themselves, as he had done, from
the disturbances of the outer world in order to
preserve the altitude which they had reached. These
three, almost brothers, had not met in the ordinary
sense for more than a thousand years, but from time
to time they communicated with each other, by
methods peculiar to themselves.</p>

<p>The signal which had reached Morial's ear came
from one of these friends.</p>

<p>It was the note struck by Kuthumi, the nearest
and closest to him of the two. It was unusual to
receive a signal of this kind at such an hour. Late
in the afternoon a time was appointed for their conversations
and therefore Morial was surprised at receiving
the signal now. He answered it instantly.</p>

<p>A moment later the sound of a voice as sweet as

<!-- page 186 -->

the bell penetrated to his ear. It appeared to come
from a great distance, and was faint but perfectly
clear.</p>

<p>"May I give you a warning," said this voice;
"will you listen to me now if I do?"</p>

<p>"I know, Kuthumi, what it is you have to say,"
replied Morial, "for although I am daring I am not
blind. There is danger, there is terrible danger, in
what I am at work upon now."</p>

<p>"Be warned by me," said Kuthumi, "rest upon
that which you have, and desire not to take that
which the Opposing Spirit covets."</p>

<p>"I have always conquered," said Morial, "and I
shall conquer to the end. My spirit is indomitable."</p>

<p>"That is true, but the Overruling Power wins
when it is least expected," was the reply. "Do you
know, have you observed, where your danger lies
now?"</p>

<p>"My friend," said Morial, "I listen to you, speak
and tell me what you have to say."</p>

<p>"It is with that young creature whose soul is as
white as she is pure herself that your danger lies.
She is so immaculate that she cannot be soiled in

<!-- page 187 -->

spite of every evil thing you throw about her. If
she were not there in the very midst of your tools,
you would win without difficulty, but as it is, her
very innocence and simplicity combined with her
courage threaten you with an overwhelming danger."</p>

<p>"Now I do not understand you," said Morial,
"explain yourself more fully."</p>

<p>"Can you not see," said this quiet voice, "that
the Opposing Spirit itself can control an individual
so unspotted by the world as this? Right in the
very heart of your machinery you have one place
which is not your own and which never can be."</p>

<p>"I understand you now," said Morial. "Well, a
frail thing like that shall not stand in my way, nor
prevent the great development I see before me. I
will crush her!"</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 188 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER XVII.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the curious community now dwelling in the big
house at Hampstead, Miss Riga had only one
absolute confidante. It is much better for a person
in such a position as hers to have no confidante at
all; but this is difficult, indeed practically impossible.
The greater the autocrat, the more necessary is the
one trusted servant. Miss Riga had found it beyond
her powers to do everything herself, and as soon as
the great ideas of the new religion and the lamasery
had entered her mind in their practical aspects, she
looked about her for an ally who would play into her
hands when necessary. Just at that time Mrs. Flite,
an old, but hitherto not much valued acquaintance,
met her by accident. Mrs. Flite had been a very
pretty woman once upon a time, in a certain sickly,
faded, gushing style, and being entirely without
intellect, had found all the pleasures of life in society
and admiration. But with the loss of her youthful

<!-- page 189 -->

beauty, which not even her yellow wig could preserve,
she found these pleasures harder to get. She
was a widow, with an income which was a mere
pittance for a woman of her tastes; and for many a
long day had she been looking about her for some
easy and agreeable means of adding to the comforts
of her life.</p>

<p>In Miss Riga's new religion Mrs. Flite beheld a
happy hunting-ground for herself. It was long since
she had been able to get into a set of rich people;
and at the first glance she saw that if she embraced
this creed, it would admit her to the society she
wanted. Then she must look out for opportunities&mdash;some
rich old lady, perhaps, a fanatic in the latest
fashion, might want a companion to humour her
follies. She looked with a keen interest at the
members of the fraternity, with an eye to business.
But before she had hit on any scheme of her own, an
accident brought her good fortune. Being absolutely
incredulous and sceptical in all matters supernatural,
she was, as a matter of course, on the look out as to
how these strange things happened in the house. An
incautious word dropped by Miss Riga put her on

<!-- page 190 -->

the right scent; in an innocent mind like Daphne's
it would not have roused suspicion&mdash;but to Mrs. Flite
it brought not only suspicion but conviction. She
laughed from genuine enjoyment; a glance of intelligence
and appreciation passed between the two
women; and from that moment Mrs. Flite found
herself established as the factotum of the high
priestess. The post was better than she had expected;
and she was well content. She had to learn a few
conjuring tricks; she had occasionally to visit a
certain Sanscrit scholar whom Miss Riga had discovered,
by inquiring at the British Museum, and get
sentences translated; and she had to talk a great
deal on subjects about which she understood nothing.
But all this was very easy to her. In return she had
a comfortable home, and sums of money from time
to time. And when the rules of the lamasery were
given to its members, and they found themselves
deprived of all amusements and fed upon gruel and
water, she and Miss Riga had many a little supper
together, and sometimes some mysterious little outings.
It is such an advantage to have one really
confidential friend!</p>

<!-- page 191 -->

<p>The great amazement of Mrs. Flite was, that people
could be so easily duped as they were. She
told herself twenty times a day, that if she had had
any idea there were so many fools in the world, she
would have made her fortune long ago.</p>

<p>Having made the great discovery that the credulous
form a large class, she determined now to make
the utmost out of it.</p>

<p>She acknowledged in Miss Riga a greater person
than herself&mdash;a true general. If Daphne could
have heard them talking together, it would have
been a revelation which would have shaken her
reason. Neither of these two had seen anything
genuine at all, and looked upon Daphne and Julian
as only a different kind of lunatics from the others
whom they deceived so easily. But they very carefully
concealed their views from Daphne, whom they
instinctively felt could not be trusted&mdash;as they would
have expressed it. It would be hard to say what
they thought of Daphne's own visions, which so
mysteriously confirmed all that happened. Probably
if they thought about it at all, which is doubtful, as
neither of them were intellectual questioners, they

<!-- page 192 -->

imagined all these things to be self-delusions, for in
this little centre of work, the mysterious duality of
the true and the false was to be seen distinctly, the
two running side by side; and this duality is more
mysterious and terrible even than that of good and
evil. To the ordinary mind the tricks played by
these old ladies would be enough to destroy all faith
in the supernatural and the unseen. And yet the
supernatural and the unseen were at work all the
time. The unintelligible power which Morial exercised,
not only created the genuine phenomena,
but utilised the false ones. Once granted such a
power as his, it is quite as easy to allow natural
incidents to play the game as to create special ones.
Mercifully for Daphne, her own visions were becoming
so real and vivid, that she was losing the sense
of trickery, with which the letters had at first filled
her. She was one of those idealists to whom the
mere transcending of the laws of nature amounted to
little, while great issues to which most people pay
but slight attention occupied the first place in her
mind. She wanted to know whether the cause was
a true one, whether it would be good, whether it

<!-- page 193 -->

would really benefit humanity. Once convinced of
that, and her life was readily offered up to it. She
was not yet convinced of that great fact, in spite of
the visions which came to her, and showed her that
the supernatural was reality. There is a great
difference in the way in which people receive the
facts of supernaturalism; to many they are of no
interest, whether true or false. To some, when once
they are seen to be real, a profound faith comes, a
kind of divinity hides in the medium's table which tilts
and tips and spells by the alphabet; and Daphne
belonged to the third class, a small one. She was
readily convinced of the supernatural, being highly
impressionable and naturally clairvoyant; but she
was as anxious to distinguish between right and
wrong in that domain, as in any other, and it was
impossible for her to be blind to the strange and
supreme selfishness which ordered this little lamasery.
Here, where unselfishness was talked of from morning
to night, the very opposite was practised by those
in authority.</p>

<p>She thought little about the money matters which
seemed to impress Mr. Gray so much. She did not

<!-- page 194 -->

realise the difficulties which these might lead to, nor
the dishonourable conduct which is possible in connection
with money.</p>

<p>To her it had never appeared of very great importance,
but she did realise that the eager disciples
were taught nothing, or allowed to talk a great deal
of innocence, or to impose upon themselves as well
as to be imposed upon, and she failed to see, in spite
of the excellent ground-work which Miss Riga, by a
little clever reading up had built up out of the old religions,
what benefit was to be done to the world by
the new system. For among them there was no one,
as yet, to seize the essence of the beautiful thoughts
which were imparted wholesale into their conversation,
and convert them into reality. There was a
general idea that something which was called the
higher life was being led in this little establishment.
As a matter of fact, a kind of despotic rule was being
exercised by Miss Riga, which gave great benefits to
herself, and caused greater deprivations to others.
Of course there was a great deal of talk about the literature
that was to be given to the world. Daphne
gathered by degrees that Mr. Gray had obtained his

<!-- page 195 -->

ready admission by depositing a fairly large sum of
money to be used for the benefit of the cause. This,
it was understood, was to be used for the publication
of books to disseminate the wonderful doctrines of
the new sect. So far, there was nothing more being
done in the way of literary production than Mr.
Water's inspired volume, of which we have had a
specimen. He continued from time to time to produce
these remarkable stanzas, and he was duly
worshipped for his extraordinary gifts. Daphne
studied them carefully, and tried very hard to make
out whether they had any meaning; but Mr. Grays
critical remarks too often showed up absence of ideas
in them for her to be able even to put any in herself.
So far she saw the whole thing to be a bubble, nevertheless,
she was kept in very strict order, in a special
state of preparation for the great work, that which
had been foreshadowed by the message given her in
the crimson rose.</p>

<p>At last one day Miss Riga told her, point blank,
that she intended to send her with Mrs. Flite to
America to form a centre there, and, as she expressed
it, to "spread the truth and extend the work."

<!-- page 196 -->

Daphne was so startled at the idea that she received
the information in silence. It seemed to her so
utterly ridiculous that she should be set up to teach
that which she did not know, and of which she had
learned, as yet, practically nothing, that she thought
it to be merely a passing fantasy of her Aunt, and that
it would not be mentioned again. But in this she was
quite mistaken. She soon found that actual preparations
were being made for the journey. Mrs.
Flite had all this in hand, and told Daphne, quite as
a matter of course, what she was doing. Mr. Gray
was sitting in the room at the time when Daphne
made this discovery, and it gave him a great deal of
food for thought. "What can the old lady's object
be in this," he conjectured. And seeking Daphne
out he begged her to tell him everything Miss Riga
should say. "There must be some reason in her
own mind, Miss Royal," he said, "or she would
not select you for such an impossible task. Why
does she not send two of the men? Foster would
go directly and do all the talking. You will never
talk to drawing-rooms full of people as the old lady
does."</p>

<!-- page 197 -->

<p>"Impossible," said Daphne, in the greatest distress
of mind. "I cannot, and I will not. No doubt I
should be willing to do it if I understood the subject,
but as yet I know nothing. I cannot go; I must insist
on having my own way in this." And so saying,
this rebellious spirit went to interview the high
priestess.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 198 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER XVIII.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> came of Daphne's interview with Miss Riga,
who remained inexorably fixed in her resolution to
send the girl to America. And neither Daphne nor
Mr. Gray could discover her motive. One circumstance
gave Mr. Gray much food for speculation, and
that was that Daphne was not to sail until just after
she came of age. This struck him as curious. It
would seem as if then Daphne should surely assert
her authority over her own life, and refuse to go on
this unpalatable journey. But Gray saw that before
that time came either she would be dangerously ill
or her spirit would be broken.</p>

<p>Miss Riga and her confederate subjected the girl to
that sort of slow daily torment which wears out the
proudest spirit. She saw no one from the outer
world, but dwelled always in this curious mental
hot-bed, where excitements and emotions of an unnatural

<!-- page 199 -->

kind were constantly being worked up. The
rules of the lamasery being now in working order,
long hours of solitude were enforced, and diet of the
very lowest was made a law. Daphne was of the
ideal temperament which takes little notice of circumstances
such as these&mdash;but her physique was very
delicate and the strain began to tell on her. It only
augmented her beauty; she grew more fragile and
ethereal with every passing hour.</p>

<p>Gray, reflecting over these things, concluded that
the object of the rules of the lamasery was to weaken
the will and break the spirit of the unlucky disciples.
He himself conformed to them very thoroughly to all
appearance, while in reality taking excellent care of
himself. He considered this quite in the light of an
altruistic duty, for if he did not keep his wits about
him who was to take care of Daphne in her lover's
absence?</p>

<p>And as the days went by, and no word came
from Julian, and Daphne visibly faded away
before his eyes, Gray determined to take heart of
grace, and forbid his conscience to call him a traitor
to his friend if he asked Daphne to marry himself.

<!-- page 200 -->

What else could he do? Loving her so dearly and
devotedly as he did, was he to see her die, because
of her lover's neglect, and the heartless selfishness of
her guardian? No, a thousand times no, exclaimed
Gray after arguing the question with himself through
a whole night. It was impossible for him to decide
what her feeling for him was; he knew that when
Julian left she cared for him and for him only; but
of late she had seemed to turn to Gray for counsel, and
lean on him. Gray told himself that if Julian had
written to her, or if she had not been in such a terrible
position and so much in need of someone to
help her, he would have kept silence; but now
surely he might speak.</p>

<p>And so at last he brought himself to do
so. He had sat watching her through the solemn
comedy called lunch, and had come to the conclusion
that if something was not done soon it
would be too late. He stayed indoors that afternoon,
contrary to his usual custom, and waited patiently
for an opportunity of being alone with her.
And then, afraid of losing a moment of this rare
chance, and afraid, too, of losing his courage (for at

<!-- page 201 -->

heart his conscience was not perfectly satisfied), he
began to speak instantly.</p>

<p>"Miss Royal," he said in a very low, earnest voice&mdash;they
were in the window of the drawing-room, and
though alone in the great room, he never felt quite sure
that the very walls had not ears in this house&mdash;"you
know Julian was my dearest friend, and you know, too,
I hope and trust, that I feel a sense of honour towards
him in his absence. God forbid that I should wrong
him in any way! I have loved you since I first met
you, but I should never speak one word if I were not
so uneasy and anxious about you. Why has Julian
left you alone, without a word, among these crazy
people? Don't be angry with me, if I dare, now that
you are in such a terrible position, to ask you if you
will give me a right to help you. It will be needed
very soon!&mdash;I implore you don't misunderstand me
or think I am making a treacherous use of the
friendship you have honoured me with!&mdash;But, indeed,
indeed you cannot fight through the difficulties before
you unaided."</p>

<p>Daphne shook her head mournfully.</p>

<p>"I will try not to misunderstand you," she said,

<!-- page 202 -->

"though I think, as Julian's friend, you should not have
said this. But let us forget it&mdash;there are such dreadful
things to think of. Oh, Mr. Gray, it doesn't matter
about me&mdash;but I am breaking my heart about Julian.
Where is he&mdash;what has become of him? I can't
think about anything else. And when I ask Aunt
Riga this she says I am showing disobedience to the
Master. Oh, Mr. Gray, I do wish Julian would come
home."</p>

<p>And this was all the result of poor Gray's casuistry
and the stifling of his conscience. Daphne burst
suddenly into tears, and sobbed in such a heart-broken
way about Julian, that Gray was silenced,
and never dared to mention his name again. Very evidently
Daphne's heart was away in Hither Tibet, and
Gray was sensible enough to know that it is of no
use to ask for what is not to be had. So he made up
his mind, like a man, to face the situation. If he
could not have the best, and take Daphne away from
this wretchedness, and keep her safe from it all, then
he must be content with the second best&mdash;accept her
friendship, and do what he could to help her. He

<!-- page 203 -->

knew he could not complain, for she had been
engaged to Julian when first he knew her.</p>

<p>And so this was the end of it. He stood by her,
trying to comfort her, listening to the passionate outburst
that gave her so much relief after her long reticence,
and trying to conquer the dreary sense of
disappointment which made him feel as if he wanted
to go away, and leave her even in her pain. But he
conquered it, and stayed with her, till someone else
entered the room and they were interrupted.</p>

<p>Then he went away and tried to think.</p>

<p>Daphne had told him, all in one rush of confidence,
how her heart was breaking for Julian&mdash;how but a
night or two since she had twice heard his voice
calling her name, distinctly, and had conceived the
idea from this that he was dead&mdash;how the vision of
Morial had several times visited her, and always
commanded obedience&mdash;how she received letters and
messages which also always commanded obedience&mdash;how
she doubted and dreaded and feared, and
yet could not resist the potency of these mysterious
visions of her own.</p>

<p>"Then you believe in these visions?" said Gray,

<!-- page 204 -->

very sadly and solemnly. "They are real to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they are real," exclaimed Daphne with
a shudder.</p>

<p>"If this thing is true," said Gray reflectively, "if
there is a supernatural life&mdash;if there are Masters in
knowledge, surely a pure soul like yours can find the
truth. Why not demand it and ask for it?"</p>

<p>The suggestion quieted Daphne&mdash;she seized upon
it, in all its force and beauty, instantly.</p>

<p>"I will do it," she cried with fervour, "oh, thank
you, Mr. Gray, for the thought; surely I can insist
upon knowing the truth. If there are Masters they
will answer my appeal! And if there are not, and
I am sincere, surely God will hear me!"</p>

<p>All this, Gray found, required a good deal of
thinking over afterwards. He went to town and
dined at his club.</p>

<p>It was a pseudo-artistic, pseudo-aristocratic club,
and at the next table to Gray, also eating a solitary
dinner, was a young peer of the realm, who came
here because he found a little Bohemianism and a
great many new ideas. He was one of those unfortunate
persons to be found in life more frequently

<!-- page 205 -->

than they should be, to whom their natural surroundings
bring no final satisfaction. Being enormously
rich he cared nothing for money, and only respected
brains. Being born a peer he had thought himself
into a tentative sort of socialism. As he was isolated
from all the common hardships of humanity he was
led (probably by some emotional law of re-action
which we do not understand) into suffering these
sorrows vicariously, and wishing there was some way
to relieve them.</p>

<p>Such, briefly, was the character of the handsome
youth, a nobleman in thought and deed and in appearance,
who was so nearly caught last season
by the new modern religion&mdash;Theosophy.</p>

<p>It first touched him that evening at the club, when
he sat next Arthur Gray at dinner.</p>

<p>Notices of the mysterious doings at the Hampstead
Lamasery had begun to creep into the papers;
courteous interviewers had been to call on Miss Riga,
and had been politely received. For Miss Riga saw
very plainly that the name of the credulous is
Legion, and that to the catching of them there is
no end.</p>

<!-- page 206 -->

<p>Morial the Mahatma, in his mystic retreat, saw
very plainly, too, this early work could as well be
done by an impostor like Miss Riga as by himself.
When he chose, he could, with one touch of reality,
take the inquirer to himself, if it were worth while,
as a devoted disciple, as he had done with Julian.
The preliminaries of finding those who wished to
enter the path could as easily be done by a common
tool like Miss Riga. It would not be an effort for
him to stretch out his destroying hand, even from
far Tibet, and silence her forever when the right
moment should come. And so, for the time being,
she had her own way, as it seemed. Vistas opened
before her which seemed limitless, visions of wealth
beyond any dreams she had ever had, and her head
was almost turned by it. What might wait for her
in the future she could not guess, when such unexpected
good fortune had come already. But she
determined that she would lose nothing of what fate,
in its generosity, bestowed on her. She, therefore,
saw the newspaper reporters, and told them just such
pretty little tales as she wished to see in print about
herself and her new religion.</p>

<!-- page 207 -->

<p>"Theosophy" was, therefore, quite a well-known
name already, and it was merely as a subject of
general conversation that Lord Ferdinand introduced
it in his desultory talk with Gray. But when Gray
answered him by saying, "Great Heavens, Ferdie,
I can think of nothing else to-night," then Lord
Ferdinand, scenting a new sensation, promptly moved
himself and his half-finished bottle of wine to his
neighbour's table.</p>

<p>"Now, Gray," he said, "I can see you are in this
business. Now just tell me all about it."</p>

<p>Gray shook his head.</p>

<p>"I could never tell you all about it," he said,
"because that's beyond the power of mortal man.
I can tell you what I know. It's a grand idea being
run, I feel sure, to her own advantage, by an unscrupulous
old woman. But the thing is so difficult
to describe that if you want to know anything about
it you had better come and see for yourself."</p>

<p>"See for myself! What, will you take me right
into the mysterious headquarters where the old witch
dwells? Oh, please do! When shall we go?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow evening, if you like," said Gray,

<!-- page 208 -->

solemnly. "It's what the old girl calls a visitors'
evening. I've never taken anyone yet; but, upon my
word, I think it might be a good thing to take you,
as a dispassionate critic and a sensible man of the
world."</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 209 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER XIX.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day Mr. Gray's first appearance at the
lamasery was at lunch-time. He was very quiet
until the meal was nearly over, when he addressed
Miss Riga, and said that he wished to bring a visitor
to the meeting in the evening.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Miss Riga, showing very little
interest in the matter.</p>

<p>"I have never used my privilege yet," said Mr.
Gray, speaking very slowly, "of bringing a visitor
to these open meetings; but yesterday evening I
went into the club, and Lord Ferdinand Abchurch,
who was sitting next me, asked me if I knew anything
about Theosophy. He is a dear boy and an
old friend of mine, so I told him all I knew. He
seemed so very interested in the matter that I offered
to bring him here to-night." While speaking, Gray
had never taken his eyes off Miss Riga, and had been
fully rewarded by a change in her countenance.</p>

<p>"Lord Ferdinand Abchurch," she repeated, in an

<!-- page 210 -->

awed voice, and then, suddenly recovering her spirit,
she exclaimed vehemently, "see how the power of
our great creed is working."</p>

<p>"Well, yes," said Gray, drily. "Ferdie is certainly
a fine recruit, if you can get him."</p>

<p>"Get him," said Miss Riga, "that is not our affair.
If the Master wants him, he will claim him and take
him for his own; and he is coming to the meeting
to-night, is he?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gray, "he is coming to the meeting."
He was trying, but without much success, to interpret
the meaning of some swift glances exchanged across
the table between Mrs. Flite and Miss Riga. Evidently
they understood each other, but he found that
he could not interpret the language of the eyes which
they used. He had promised to meet Lord Ferdie
at the club at dinner, and drive down to Hampstead
with him afterwards, which he rather regretted, for he
had a kind of idea that some special sort of preparations
were going to be made for the reception of the august
visitor. However, he could not stay to watch, for
he knew that Lord Abchurch would not come if he
did not meet him.</p>

<!-- page 211 -->

<p>Daphne shut herself in her own room that afternoon,
hoping that in the excitement of a titled visitor, which
she knew would please her aunt very much, that she,
herself, and her great mission in America might be
temporarily forgotten. But not so; her quiet was
soon disturbed by the arrival of Miss Riga and Mrs.
Flite in company.</p>

<p>"Daphne," said Miss Riga in a very decided manner,
"the Master wishes you to make the preliminary
speech to-night."</p>

<p>Daphne was lying on a couch reading. She put
down her book and sat up with a sudden expression
of defiance on her face which was new to it.</p>

<p>"I cannot do that, Aunt Riga," she said; "you
seem to know all about the subject, but I know
nothing."</p>

<p>Mrs. Flite lifted her hands and eyes to Heaven, as
if in horror of this statement.</p>

<p>"How can you talk like this, Daphne," said Miss
Riga. "I only want you to repeat what you have
often heard me say; but it would be more effective
from you than from me, and how you can say that
you know nothing of the subject when you yourself

<!-- page 212 -->

have been the special recipient of the Master's messages,
I cannot tell."</p>

<p>"I cannot help that," said Daphne. "I have seen
visions, certainly, and there are strange things going
on that I cannot explain. But I am not fitted to
speak as you speak to strangers, because I have not
been taught, and therefore cannot teach."</p>

<p>Something in Daphne's manner showed Miss Riga,
who knew her very well, that on this point it was
useless to do battle. Daphne was very yielding
up to a certain point; but when her mind was made
up she was as immovable as a rock. Miss Riga,
having exchanged a glance with Mrs. Flite, got up
and left the room. Mrs. Flite then fell into ordinary
conversation, and being a chatty and pleasant sort of
person, well practised in ordinary wiles, she soon succeeded
in distracting Daphne's attention, and amusing
her a little. She did not leave her until Daphne had
dressed herself for the evening, and the girl never
noticed, or perhaps never realised, until afterwards that
it was Mrs. Flite who had dressed her hair, and that
Mrs. Flite had selected from her wardrobe the very
dress she wore, and quietly put it ready for her, and

<!-- page 213 -->

had put finishing touches to her toilet. While doing
this she had kept Daphne's mind off the distressing
subject, which harassed her so, and the consequence
was, that when she took the girl down with her into
the drawing-room, it was a Daphne very like the
brilliant one of old that made her appearance there.
Miss Riga looked up at her and nodded an approval
which her confederate well understood.</p>

<p>Daphne was not allowed to have time for thought,
for the two old ladies contrived to amuse her or to
see her amused until the moment when Mr. Gray and
the new inquirer walked in. Lord Ferdie was one of
those charming men who win all hearts at once, and
there was no necessity for the schemers to pretend
they liked him, for that was such an easy thing to do.</p>

<p>The business of the meeting was commenced within
a few minutes after his arrival. Miss Riga delivered
the preliminary speech as usual, but with some little
embroideries for Lord Ferdie's benefit. While this
was going on Mrs. Flite came to Daphne, and whispered
a few words into her ear.</p>

<p>"There is a message from the Master for Lord
Ferdinand Abchurch, and you are to deliver it to him."</p>

<!-- page 214 -->

<p>"Give it to me, then," said Daphne.</p>

<p>"You are to say," said Mrs. Flite, "that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you mean," said Daphne, "I do not
understand."</p>

<p>"If I tell you the words," said Mrs. Flite, "will you
repeat them to him as a message from the Master?
This order has been given to Miss Riga."</p>

<p>Daphne turned and looked Mrs. Flite straight in
the face, and the woman's eyes fell before her gaze.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I will not; I must be convinced
of the reality of the message before I can do such a
thing as that."</p>

<p>"Oh, Daphne," said Mrs. Flite, "you will bring a
terrible punishment upon yourself by this disobedience
and incredulity."</p>

<p>She said no more but got up and left her, and
Daphne, sitting alone, became plunged in thought.
Terrible suspicions were beginning to work in her
mind, and the horror of them rushed back upon her
now with redoubled vigour. Gray, who was sitting
opposite, watched her ceaselessly, and had taken
careful note of the little play enacted before his eyes.
He understood very well that she had been asked to

<!-- page 215 -->

do something and had refused; but what could it be?
Seeing that she was left entirely alone, he devoted his
attention to Mrs. Flite, who went about the room
with an air which convinced him that she had some
plan to carry out. Further stanzas from Mr. Water's
wonderful book, depicting the creation of the world,
were read, and a discussion upon these was commenced.
Gray noticed that while this discussion
went on Mrs. Flite devoted herself to reaching Lord
Abchurch's neighbourhood by easy and scarcely
noticeable stages. No one would have guessed what
she was doing, who had not been as keenly on the
watch as he was. Presently he saw Lord Ferdie
start, and then look at some small thing which was
in his hand, and then quickly close his hand upon
it. What was this? That he decided to find out from
Lord Abchurch. In the meantime he observed that
Mrs. Flite now quieted down, and presently took
her original place with an air of having accomplished
her task.</p>

<p>Lord Ferdie's private cab was waiting for him, and
when the meeting broke up he asked Gray to drive
back to town with him. Gray agreed, for reasons of

<!-- page 216 -->

his own. As soon as they were in the cab Lord
Abchurch said to him: "Now tell me, what does all
this mean?"</p>

<p>"I brought you here," said Gray, "that you might
tell me."</p>

<p>"I suppose you know," said Lord Ferdie, "that I
have received a Mahatmic missive&mdash;a letter from the
Master himself&mdash;in the course of the evening."</p>

<p>"I guessed as much," said Gray.</p>

<p>"It appears," said Lord Ferdie, "that I have all the
characteristics of the neophyte of the first water, if I
choose to go in for the higher life. I may become a
Mahatmic within a reasonable and measurable time.
Awfully nice that, dear boy."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of it?" said Gray.</p>

<p>"I want to know," said Lord Ferdie, "what position
Miss Royal occupies in the whole business. I
would stake my life on that girl's honesty and truth.
They are to be read in her face. She, surely, is not
hypocrite nor conjuror as she is depicted."</p>

<p>"Now," said Gray, "you come to the <i>crux</i> of the
whole matter, you get beyond me. Miss Royal is
what spiritualists call clairvoyant. She sees visions

<!-- page 217 -->

and dreams dreams. I have had them from her own
lips, and they are so strange that it is no wonder that
she is entangled in this network. On the face of the
thing the whole fabric appears to be mere charlatanry,
but my knowledge of Miss Royal and of Julian
Arundel convinces me that there is something else
in it, something else which cannot yet be explained."</p>

<p>"Then you cannot enlighten me," said Lord Ferdie.</p>

<p>"Not yet," said Gray.</p>

<p>"Well, in that case," said Lord Ferdie, "I will
investigate for myself. Miss Royal's face induces
me to do that. I shall go down to-morrow, and talk
the whole day. Perhaps I shall become a member,
I don't know."</p>

<p>"And this," said Gray, "this trouble you take
because Miss Royal is beautiful?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lord Ferdie, "but, not only that. Her
face has the light of truth in it, and I want to understand
the situation."</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 218 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER XX.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day Gray found there was a mysterious
atmosphere about the house. There seemed to be
some important business on hand, of which he knew
nothing. He soon detected that Daphne occupied a
different position on this day from any she had occupied
before. She was interviewed by one person
after the other, much as a queen might be interviewed
by her ministers. Hitherto she had always been
treated as a child that was to obey, and therefore he
saw there must be some change, for which he had not
been prepared. He took an opportunity as early as
possible in the day to ask Daphne what it meant. He
did not get this opportunity until quite late in the
afternoon, for all the morning Daphne stayed in her
own room, and no one saw her but Mrs. Flite and
Miss Riga. In the afternoon, however, pale and exhausted,
she came into the drawing-room, and there
Gray found her.</p>

<!-- page 219 -->

<p>"What is the mystery, to-day, Miss Royal," he
said, "it seems as if this is some great occasion."</p>

<p>"Why, of course it is, Mr. Gray," she answered.
"Why, don't you know this is my birthday?"</p>

<p>"Your birthday," said Gray, who seemed suddenly
struck by some thought which he did not care to
express.</p>

<p>"Yes, I come of age to-day," said Daphne, "and
it was to have been my wedding-day. Two years
have passed since it was fixed, but how changed it
all is now!"</p>

<p>"I offer you all the good wishes possible," said
Mr. Gray, "but you must excuse me if my first feeling
is one of curiosity. I want to know what those
old ladies have been talking about all the morning.
It is no business of mine, but I have been your
friend so far in Julian's absence, and I may be of
use to you yet."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Daphne, "it is nothing but money,
always money; I am perfectly sick of the subject.
It does not interest me at all."</p>

<p>"It may not interest you," said Gray, "but nevertheless
it is a very serious matter. You don't realise

<!-- page 220 -->

how serious it is. Will you tell me what is going
on?"</p>

<p>"I would if I could," said Daphne, "but it is impossible.
Our lawyer is coming directly, and I have
to sign a number of papers. That is all I can tell
you."</p>

<p>"But why is it all you can tell me," said Gray,
"why should you not tell me what the papers are?"</p>

<p>"For a very simple reason," replied Daphne, "I
have promised not to tell anyone."</p>

<p>Gray replied to this in a low whistle.</p>

<p>"Then the old ladies mean business," he said,
"and I wish to goodness I could find out what they are
doing. What do you mean by saying they extracted
a promise from you that you would tell nobody
about it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, what does it matter," said Daphne, "there
are much more important things in the world than
money."</p>

<p>Gray made no direct reply, for indeed this did not
need a direct answer. He walked about the room
for a moment, and then turning to Daphne, he said:</p>

<p>"Answer me seriously, Miss Royal, do you consider

<!-- page 221 -->

yourself bound to say nothing about the business
that you are doing to-day, and to tell no one
what those papers are?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Daphne, with an air of great
surprise. "Did I not tell you I had given my word?"</p>

<p>A little later in the afternoon, Miss Riga's lawyer
arrived: the servants were told that he was the only
visitor to be admitted. This was a detail which did
not escape Gray's attention. A great many visitors
came to the house now in the afternoon; it had become
a sort of public resort, and it was a very noticeable
fact that the house was to be closed to visitors.
Gray knew that he could do nothing, but yet he could
not tear himself away. He walked about the house,
and wondered what were the bonds with which
Daphne was binding herself, and how far she
was robbing herself of her own; but he was powerless.
And so at last he resolved to go to town, and
talk to Lord Ferdie about it. He had come to the
conclusion that it would be a great relief to have a
confidant in the matter. Just as he was passing
through the hall to go out he heard Miss Riga's
voice give an order to one of the servants. This was to

<!-- page 222 -->

the effect that now, or at any time, if Lord Ferdinand
Abchurch was to call he was to be admitted.</p>

<p>"Well," said Gray to himself as he went out by
the front door, "that is an invitation for Lord Ferdie.
I will take it to him. He has great natural advantages,
and he may be able to do what I cannot."</p>

<p>In the early part of the evening of Daphne's coming
of age, the house was very quiet. She was sitting
alone in her room and thinking. She never gave a
thought&mdash;not a serious thought&mdash;to the business
transactions she had been engaged in, for she considered
them of no account, and she had so much
else to think about.</p>

<p>Just twenty-one&mdash;only a girl still with such strange
experiences of her life. All the other members of the
Lamasery were out of doors, with the exception of
the two old ladies. They had a little sitting-room of
their own upstairs, where the interview with the
lawyer had been held. And after he had gone and
Daphne had left them, Miss Riga locked the door in
order to enjoy a few minutes' real private conversation.</p>

<p>"Upon my word," said Mrs. Flite, the moment

<!-- page 223 -->

she heard the key turned, and knew it was safe to
speak, "you have been successful beyond my wildest
dreams. It is all right now, dear, there is nothing
to fear. We have not got much time left, it is true,
but what we have got we can enjoy thoroughly."</p>

<p>"We may," said Miss Riga, who did not look so
jubilant. "So far everything has succeeded splendidly,
but don't forget we have still Daphne to deal
with. She has signed these deeds, which will hold
good if we can get her out of the country, but can
we? I don't know how to convince her that she has
a mission. The child is beyond me, she is not like
the rest of them. And yet she is the only one who
really believes in the thing itself, and I cannot make
it out."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Flite, "there is only one thing
to be done; we must 'hedge.' "</p>

<p>"You are an old gambler," said Miss Riga; "perhaps
you can tell me how to do it. At the moment
I don't quite see my way."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is simple enough," said Mrs. Flite; "you
have a grand card in your hands. Now, keep Daphne
up to the idea that she is going to America, and if

<!-- page 224 -->

she goes to America, you and I can arrange it very
easily. I take her, and I guarantee that she does not
come back until you have done all you wish. In the
meantime, compel her to bring Lord Abchurch into
the camp, and you will have in him just as great a
prize as in Daphne herself, I grant you; but you
will have to use a more subtle diplomacy, because
he is a man of the world. But, nevertheless, if he
once lends himself to this absurd affair, he will have
to pay very heavily to get out of it." It was at that
moment Miss Riga opened the door again, and gave
the order which Gray overheard. She returned to
the room, locked the door, and sat down by Mrs.
Flite. "And do you think," she said, "that he will
ever lend himself to this affair? I fancy he is too
good a bird to be caught. He is too clever and too
well educated."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Mrs. Flite, "he is both; but
then you must remember that he is one of those men
who sacrifice themselves for a cause. I know him&mdash;not
personally, of course&mdash;but I know his reputation
very well, indeed. In spite of his being a peer
of the realm, he has been a Socialist, and he got disgusted

<!-- page 225 -->

with it. Every fantastical cause that has
come up in his time, which promised to benefit the
human race, he has gone into. All those people he
has been mixed up with have benefited a little. I
only propose that he should do the same thing as us,
and we will benefit a great deal. It may be possible
to get him into the community and take Daphne to
America as well, but certainly we will do one thing
or the other."</p>

<p>"And how are we going to get him into the community,"
inquired Miss Riga.</p>

<p>"We can only do it through Daphne," said Mrs.
Flite, "for Daphne can do it. He would be more
impressed by the air of innocence and conviction
about that girl last night than by anything you said or
anything he saw. Daphne was very obstinate about
giving him a message, but I think she can be conquered,
and if she gives him a message in which he is
told to enter the brotherhood and give his life to the
cause, the whole thing can be settled. I will take her
to America the next day."</p>

<p>"Well, how is it to be done? You are showing
yourself the general now. I must confess Daphne is

<!-- page 226 -->

beyond me. I can manage the rest, but not Daphne."</p>

<p>"Well, leave it to me," said Mrs. Flite, "and let
me try my hand. If you undertake to back up
everything I say without questioning me I think I
can manage it."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Miss Riga, who was very complacent,
having succeeded in her own enterprise
beyond her wildest hopes.</p>

<p>The result of this was that a little later in the evening
instead of making their appearance in the drawing
room, Mrs. Flite and Daphne were shut up in
Daphne's room, and Mrs. Flite was a diplomatist of
the first water, and had always been agreeable to
Daphne, who looked upon her, though she did not
like her, as a friend rather than otherwise. This
evening Mrs. Flite pursued the same policy. She
talked to her very pleasantly about all manner of
things and put Daphne at her ease. Then quite
suddenly she turned to the girl and said:</p>

<p>"Now, Daphne, I have a little piece of business to
do, and I want you to answer me very plainly.
Why did you refuse to give that message to Lord
Ferdinand Abchurch last night?"</p>

<!-- page 227 -->

<p>Daphne was amazed and for a moment sat silent.
Then she collected herself and said, "for this reason,
that I had no proof that it was genuine."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed," said Mrs. Flite, "who is it you
mistrust, myself or Miss Riga?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell you that I distrust either of you,
but I am simply in the dark about the whole matter."</p>

<p>"You are more than that, Daphne," said Mrs.
Flite; "you do distrust one or the other of us. Let
me tell you, child, you have been so associated with
us that you cannot escape from that association. I
am only a learner, but now I accept it, and therefore
it is not for me to speak as you or your aunt would,
who have been in this thing from the commencement.
But I am a woman of the world, and I can
assure you that it is impossible to separate yourself
from her now. Whatever this thing is, whether it
is genuine or whether it is a fraud, you and she are
identified, and do you see what I mean," she said
after a moment's pause.</p>

<p>Daphne rose, drawing herself up to her full height,
before she replied. "You imply," she said, "that
the whole thing is a fraud, and that I have not got

<!-- page 228 -->

the power to escape from it, having been associated
with it so far. Is that what you mean?"</p>

<p>"You can take it so if you like," said Mrs. Flite,
composedly. "And let me tell you," she went on,
"that your future is not in your own hands. If you
suspect your aunt of forging these messages, which
convey orders to her disciples, why should she not
suspect you of doing it?"</p>

<p>This was totally a new idea to Daphne, and she
stood silent and astonished. "If she thinks you are
going to accuse her," said Mrs. Flite, "she will settle
the whole thing very easily by accusing you beforehand."
Daphne still made no answer, her brain was
reeling under this revelation.</p>

<p>"And you know," went on Mrs. Flite, "that we
are all of us, unfortunately, in the power of the law.
If these messages have been forged, and if any of us
should choose to go to law for redress, money has
been taken on false pretences. It won't do, my
dear, we must hold together now. What your fate
may be I cannot say, but the fact that you yourself
talk of visions which you consider real, puts you in
a more helpless position than any of the others. At

<!-- page 229 -->

the very least you will be looked upon as mad.
Now, don't be foolish, but lay up for yourself a quiet
future. If you play into our hands we will play into
yours. You have nothing to do, but when Lord
Ferdie next visits us to give to him the message
which I shall dictate to you. He will accept it from
you as a truth, because he believes in you. I can
see that at once. As soon as we have rescued him
for the cause you and I will take the next boat for
America, and when we are once there I won't allow
you to be bothered any more. You shall be free
from the whole thing&mdash;you will have done all that is
wanted. But this one thing you positively must do."</p>

<p>For a moment there was complete silence after
Mrs. Flite had delivered this little speech. Daphne
had stood quite still, had not moved, had said never a
word since first she rose from her chair in her amazement.
But the amazement was giving place to a
rage and great indignation. At last she found speech.</p>

<p>"And this thing," she said, "I positively refuse to
do. I would infinitely rather end my days in Colney
Hatch, or in the workhouse, than lend myself to
these tricks and frauds of yours."</p>

<!-- page 230 -->

<p>"Merciful power!" exclaimed Mrs. Flite, who
had not in the least expected such a reply, "do you
mean it?"</p>

<p>"I mean it," said Daphne, in a manner which she
never hitherto used and which seemed to change her
in a moment to a woman, "I mean it," she said,
"and you will not find me alter, and I know you
now for what you are. If this thing is controlled by
that Master whom I have seen in my visions, then
that Master is as bad as you are yourselves. Nothing
will induce me to be your tool or his."</p>

<p>Just at this moment a loud knock at the front door
resounded through the house. The two women
were so absorbed in what they were saying to each
other that they took no interest in it, and simply remained
as they were, looking into each other's eyes.
Someone was admitted to the house, and presently
a servant came and said that Miss Royal was
wanted.</p>

<p>"Come in," said Daphne, who was still standing
like a statue, "what am I wanted for?"</p>

<p>"Miss Riga has sent me," said the servant, "to
tell you that Lord Ferdinand Abchurch is here."</p>

<!-- page 231 -->

<p>"Then you can tell Miss Riga that I am not coming
down."</p>

<p>Mrs. Flite remained where she was, turning the
whole matter over in her mind and wondering what
to do next, for her generalship was outwitted. She
was a creature of diplomacy, expecting always to
meet the same quality, but she had met something
real instead, something like a rock she could not
move. A moment later Miss Riga herself entered
the room.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" she said. "I want Daphne
downstairs; it is no good me talking to Lord Ferdie,
you know that very well."</p>

<p>"I am not coming," said Daphne, suddenly flaming
up, "you have gone too far, and I defy you both.
I do more&mdash;if the Master has ordered these things
then I defy the Master himself. Look to yourselves,
for I shall speak the truth from henceforward, now
that I know it, to whoever asks me." So saying, she
swept out of the room, leaving the two old ladies
looking at each other in dismay.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 232 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER XXI.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daphne</span> did not leave her room at all that evening
until everyone had gone to bed. Lord Ferdie stayed
some hours in the hope that she would appear, but
she did not. All the time he was in the house, she
paced her room to and fro, harassed by a tumult of
thought. Late in the night, when all the house was
quiet, an unexpected calm fell suddenly on her
troubled spirit. A sense of new strength came to
her, a feeling of resolution, deep enough to help her
face the Evil One himself.</p>

<p>There is some mysterious inspiration to the restless
soul in the silence and darkness of the night. Daphne,
now grown still, and sitting silently in her room,
felt, as the night advanced, as if she were now alone
with the soul of the world, as if she could now
demand the truth and command it. Led by some
impulse which she could not have explained even to

<!-- page 233 -->

herself, she rose suddenly, and taking her reading
lamp in her hand, left the room, and went down the
dark passages and the great silent, shadowy stairway
to the drawing-room. She walked across it,
and passed through the archway with an inspired
look in her face which lent it a strange light. Little
did she guess that as she approached the easel that
held the portrait of Morial, she entered the range of
Julian's vision!&mdash;that he could see her as plainly as
though he were in the room with her. Her beauty
seemed to him unearthly, with this strange, set expression
on her face, but greater than ever. She
seemed transfigured, as if she had cast off the trammels
of her body; she looked like an angel.</p>

<p>Julian was keeping vigil, watching the crystal.</p>

<p>He had seen the whole proceedings of the day in
his old home, but had not been able to understand
them properly, for want of a clue. He had remained
riveted to the contemplation of this mystic mirror,
which revealed to them all the doings of those he
loved.</p>

<p>Morial left him alone to watch and to ponder.
Until he had exhausted his interest in his old home

<!-- page 234 -->

and surroundings, and offered up his heart at the
altar of sacrifice, it was useless to attempt to initiate
him further, or excite his interest in any other matter.
In occultism, whether it be good or evil, this is the
first step; and until it has been absolutely accomplished
it is in no way possible to accomplish any
other.</p>

<p>Therefore the neophyte was left alone with this
terrible mirror, which reflected the life which he had
left. It seemed an impossibility to him to tear himself
away, and indeed I doubt whether anyone who
has not been through the experience could imagine
how much more terrible than any unexpected ghosts
or extraordinary apparitions these familiar thoughts
of home were to Julian when so far removed from
them. To see and feel all that Daphne was doing
and thinking, and to realise the hypocrisy and shams
that surrounded her, appalled him as no dweller
of the threshold, nor Angel Gabriel even, could have
done, for the sense of responsibility upon himself,
the sense of neglected duty was almost more than he
could bear. Why had he left a plain, straightforward
path&mdash;the path that lies before every man, who has

<!-- page 235 -->

taken up the ordinary responsibilities of life,&mdash;why
had he left it for this wild unintelligible quest?</p>

<p>He felt like a lost soul, looking out from its fleshy
prison, here in this desert, and the work of his own
hands, for if he had not come away, none of this
would have happened.</p>

<p>Daphne advanced straight across the room to the
easel on which Morial's portrait stood. She lit the
candles on each side of it, and then she lit a number
of other lights in the room. Julian could see all this;
the crystal was like a shining diamond, with the
light within it. Then she returned to the portrait,
unlocked the doors, and flung them wide open. She
stood back from it, and looked steadily at it, drawing
herself up to her full height, and wore a look
such as he had never seen upon her face before.</p>

<p>This seemed hardly like the girl he had known;
although she had the same features&mdash;this was like
the priestess of Isis. She remained silent for some
moments, and Julian was very much puzzled as to
what she was doing, but suddenly he understood.
She extended her arms, and pointing at the portrait
uttered the one word, "Morial!" in a tone of command.

<!-- page 236 -->

The word was uttered again and again, and
then, to his surprise, she turned and faced him full,
as though she realised in what direction to throw her
command. Again she uttered the word, again she
used this command, and there was something in her
voice and form as she did so that made Julian quail
before her, and feel glad that he had nothing to be
ashamed of in her eyes. In the same instant his
whole attention was absorbed by the fact that another
person was with him.</p>

<p>Morial was there! Morial stood beside him!
Morial had answered the call!</p>

<p>Julian with difficulty drew his eyes from the figure
within the crystal which stood there like a shining
spirit, and looked at the figure beside him. Yes, it
was Morial, who had attended to this call that came
from the other part of the world. Julian looked
back at Daphne, and he understood, when he looked
at her, that Morial had come within her vision. She
saw him, and she still commanded him, her hand
outstretched, her face resolute. She was no longer
his tool, he was hers. And while Julian observed
this with the utmost amazement, the sound of her

<!-- page 237 -->

voice falling on his ears, came, as it seemed, from a
long distance, but still perfectly distinct.</p>

<p>"Morial," she said, "I command you, answer
me. What is it you want with Lord Ferdinand
Abchurch?" and, to Julian's amazement, he heard the
beautiful voice of the man at his side answer
her:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I want him as my servant."</p>

<p>"And is it you, that you would have me play
these tricks upon him?" said Daphne. "If you want
him why not approach him honestly yourself, instead
of letting these monsters prey upon him."</p>

<p>"That does not concern me," said Morial, "why
do you question me about it?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Daphne, speaking calmly and
quietly, every word dropping like the tinkle of silver
on the ears of those who listened, "because I
see cheating and trickery, and I will not lend myself
to it. If you are one of the White Brotherhood
you will not employ such methods as these. Answer
me, I command you, and tell me what you
want of Lord Abchurch."</p>

<p>And Morial answered her, "He has a great political

<!-- page 238 -->

future before him, and I want that future for
my own purpose."</p>

<p>"For your evil and selfish purpose," cried Daphne.
"No, you shall not have him. He is honest, and I
will not be the tool of these wretches who would take
his money, and teach him nothing. If you are the
true Master, you can influence him directly without
this paltry teaching. But you are not; I know you,
and I denounce you. The first step you force us
into, poor and paltry though it is, compels us to give
up our souls and our consciences; and then, perhaps,
we are of some use to you. That would not be if
you were true. I will not be a willing tool, I refuse
to be, and I shall denounce you, and deny you, here
in your own temple."</p>

<p>As she said this, it seemed to Julian as if she was
actually materialised before his eyes, as if the crystal
was merely a frame for her living form, or rather, a
frame that surrounded it. Yes, Daphne stood there
in front of him, but her eyes were fixed upon Morial.
It was to him that she gave all her attention. Again
he made an effort to take his eyes from her, and look
at the strange being who stood by his side. He did

<!-- page 239 -->

so, and saw a thing stranger than he expected.
Morial stood there like a statue, tinted, coloured certainly,
but just as if carved in marble, and for a moment
Julian was convinced that life had gone from
him, that he was turned to stone. He cried out,
hardly knowing that he did so, "Daphne, what have
you done." These words penetrated to her ears,
through the strange medium which had carried her
voice to him. He heard her give a sharp cry of joy
and of exaltation, and looking back he saw that her
eyes were now fixed on him, and she had stretched
out both her hands as if in welcome. And then she
spoke directly to him: "Julian," she said, "have no
fear, the Good Spirit will save us; see, the dark mystery
is soulless, he cannot speak or live in the light
of conscience."</p>

<p>Julian sprang forward, almost convinced that he
could touch her, as he stood there, but his action
induced some change which drew the mysterious
cloud over the crystal, and in a moment the vision
was gone, and he stood in the dim light of Morial's
laboratory alone with this soulless figure.</p>

<p>Never had he experienced such a sensation as

<!-- page 240 -->

that which came over him when he looked at this
statue, which appeared truly void of life. Was it
possible that this was the Morial of power, of God-like
attributes whom he had so feared? Could this
be the great one who could span the earth, and who
had, by his own magic power, created this extraordinary
mirror which destroyed time and space?
Could it be? It was,&mdash;that he knew, for only a few
minutes ago he had stood beside him; what could
it mean then? Julian had not had time to realize
the meaning of the miracle that had occurred close
to him, under his agonised scrutiny. He did not yet
grasp all that Daphne had meant in her last words.
They came to her as an inspiration, a direct knowledge
of the Unseen which governs the world; but
to him they were only words as yet, and he was utterly
baffled by the extraordinary change he saw before
him. The unearthliness, the weirdness of it surpassed
anything he could have imagined. It seemed
as if with Morial's silence, all the world was silent.
There was no sound, no movement, nothing; and
he knew not where to go or where to turn in this
strange wilderness without Morial's aid. But before

<!-- page 241 -->

he had had time to do more than wonder at what he
saw, a change came over Morial's face, and life returned,
slowly and steadily, and the first sign of the
animated soul was the brilliant smile of the beautiful
youth whose person had so fascinated Julian when
he first found Morial in the hermitage. The magician
was gone, the dark master was in abeyance,
and what he saw was the young man whose mere
glance excited sympathy and aroused love.</p>

<p>"Something very curious has happened," said
Morial, in the most ordinary, pleasant tone of voice,
"and I do not yet know the reason of it. Come
with me and we will leave this place, and take the
rest I am sure we both need."</p>

<p>So saying he led the way out of the great room,
and Julian with one glance at the darkened mirror
followed him without comment. Morial went downstairs
and through the corridors into the room in
which he had first entertained Julian. This room
was always brilliantly lit, always ready as if for a
feast; it always had in it a subtle atmosphere of
luxury and pleasure. Morial flung himself upon one
of the couches, and seemed as if he was going to

<!-- page 242 -->

fall into a sleep or a deep reverie. But after a moment
he started up, and began to walk about the
room, apparently unconscious, or else forgetful of
Julian's presence.</p>

<p>"There is something I do not understand about
it," he said. "There is something stronger than
myself I have met with; through the long centuries
in which I have succeeded I have met with
nothing like this. Kuthumi, I must speak with you,
I must speak with both my friends."</p>

<p>Almost before he had uttered the words there came
the delicate sound of silvery bells on the air, and
then a voice, remote, but very clear. "You want
us, Morial," said this voice, "you are in great danger,
and we are both perfectly conscious of it. We shall
be with you at once."</p>

<p>Morial appeared now suddenly to remember Julian's
presence. He turned to him abruptly, and speaking
to him in a cold, hard voice, "you must rest," he said.</p>

<p>"You mean," replied Julian, with something of the
manner he would have used to an ordinary man,
"you want to leave me."</p>

<p>"Certainly," answered Morial, "unless you rest

<!-- page 243 -->

you will die, for your vigil has been a terrible and
long one. Come, let me give you some medicine, or
wine, whatever you like to call it, and then you will
rest in peace, until there is need for you again."</p>

<p>As Morial spoke, Julian recognised for the first
time, that he was absolutely worn out, and he knew
very well that he needed all his strength. He had
benefited in so extraordinary a manner from Morial's
cordials before, and he did not hesitate to drink the
one offered to him now. He knew that he could
not stay where he was, his faculties were succumbing,
and he would not have the strength to remain,
even if he had been privileged to do so. But Morial
was his host, and wished him gone. Being a gentleman
as well as a neophyte, he drank the wine offered
him, and went away to the ivory couch, where, instantly,
he was lost in sleep.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 244 -->

<p class="center">CHAPTER XXII.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Julian's</span> next sensation was that of awakening with
a sudden start which comes from the knowledge
that there is an unexpected person in the room.
The feeling was one of awe, as well as surprise. It
seemed to him as if some very strange visitor had
come to his bedside, for the moment he opened his
eyes they rested on the figure of a man who was
standing beside him, looking at him gravely and
earnestly. He had never seen this figure before, and
yet it gave him that curious feeling of recognition
which most of us know. He knew at once that this
grave man, this grey-bearded cassida, and yet so
mild looking, was of Morial's brotherhood. His
heart leaped within him at the thought. Perhaps
this was a Master who was human, and who had
retained a sense of conscience and honour. These
thoughts flashed through his mind on the moment

<!-- page 245 -->

of waking, while he lay without moving, gazing on
this unexpected figure. But as soon as he was quite
awake, which from the effect of surprise was very
quickly, his visitor drew a chair from its place, put
it near to Julians couch, and sat down upon it in
the most friendly manner.</p>

<p>"You are rested now, are you not?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Perfectly," said Julian. "What is it that lies
before me now? I have all my strength back, and I
am ready."</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing so alarming," he replied, "only
a simple matter of discussion. I have come to
talk to you a little, to try and make you realise your
position, and how madly you are sacrificing a great
future for a merely temporal good."</p>

<p>"And how do you know all this about me?" said
Julian.</p>

<p>"There is nothing wonderful about that," was the
answer. "I have known all about you, as you call
it, since you left London in answer to Morial's call,
and I have been talking to him ever since you came
into this room and fell asleep."</p>

<p>"Oh, then you are Kuthumi," with an instantaneous

<!-- page 246 -->

feeling of conviction. "It was you whom
Morial called to his aid and counsel."</p>

<p>A curious feeling of defiance took possession of
him, as he said this, and he added, inspired by this
feeling, "Why have you come to see me, what
have you to say to me?"</p>

<p>"I will answer your questions one by one," said
his visitor, with the gentle, benevolent manner which
seemed to be his strongest characteristic. "You are
quite right, your intuition serves you well. I am
Kuthumi, and I came at Morial's call, to counsel
him with the third of our brotherhood, whose name
you do not know, and never will know. I have
come to talk to you, because Morial has selected
you for a great mission, and in your success or failure
his welfare is concerned."</p>

<p>"But I am only a child in the hands of you," said
Julian, rather bitterly, "you that are Masters of the
earth&mdash;of life."</p>

<p>"Yes, you are only a child," said Kuthumi very
composedly. "You are less than a child in our
hands. We can take your life, we can give it back
to you, but the dominant will in you we cannot

<!-- page 247 -->

control, unless you determine to offer up your heart
in the sacrifice which Morial showed you."</p>

<p>"And if I refuse?" said Julian.</p>

<p>"Then you must fail on the very threshold of the
great life, as so many have done, and with your
failure you must yield your earthly life. No man
can go so far as you have gone, and go back into
the world and face it. That cannot be permitted.
Pause, and consider, my friend, before you refuse to
sacrifice the youth, and health, and strength of this
life you are now living; pause a thousand times, and
consider before you sacrifice all the potentialities
that lie in the centuries before you if you persevere
in the great life."</p>

<p>Julian was silent for a moment, and then he said,
in a very low voice, "Well, what is required of me,
what does the surrender of the heart actually mean?"</p>

<p>"You know," was the answer, "as well as I can
tell you. You have to give up all thought of those
whom you have loved. It is not bare selfishness in
its simple form that will ruin you in your great
faith, but it is the thought for others which paralyses
you. This seems unlike selfishness, but, believe me,

<!-- page 248 -->

it is not. Why should you care for one or two individuals
who pass away as the flowers pass away, so
short is their span? Why should that care interfere
with the possibilities of a chosen life which shall be
continuous, and shall have the great gift of continuity
through all ages. To you is the great opportunity
given of becoming one of ourselves when we pass
on. Although we have centuries of immortality on
this earth, yet there comes an end to this, because
our power becomes too great, others step in and
take our places, and Morial has offered you this one
great chance. If you take it, if you decide to blot
out your personal passions and affections, then to
the whole race you may be as a god."</p>

<p>"And to do that," said Julian, "I have to blot out,
not only my affections but my conscience."</p>

<p>It seemed to him, almost as if Daphne prompted
him to say those words, as if her spirit was with him.
In reality he saw her spirit-like figure, as he had seen
her in the crystal, clearly before him. She stood
there, or her memory of her stood there, like an
angel, forbidding him to be deceived by this Jesuitical
reasoning.</p>

<!-- page 249 -->

<p>"The first thing," said Kuthumi, with perfect calmness,
"that the neophyte surrenders to his Master is
his conscience. What can a mortal creature of a
short span of life, such as yours, know of actual right
and wrong? Nothing; it is impossible. You must
surrender your own judgment to that of those who
are greater than yourself. If you cannot do this, you
can do nothing."</p>

<p>"I cannot do it," said Julian, "it is useless. I am
beginning to understand now, as I recover my faculties,
the meaning of all that I have seen, in my long
vigil, in the crystal. If those visions were true, and
I cannot doubt them, for they bore the internal stamp
of truth, then it is my duty to go back, and to save
the helpless creatures whom I have left behind me
from the consequences of my fanatical act. I left my
home maddened, and carried out of myself, by a
supernatural call. I return to it convinced that the
every-day duties must be attended to before these
others which are out of focus with life."</p>

<p>"Let me tell you," said Kuthumi, "that if you refuse
to enter upon the ceremony of sacrifice, you will never
leave this place."</p>

<!-- page 250 -->

<p>There was a long pause after this. Julian knew
well what the sinister words uttered in that sweet
voice meant. He thought, for and against, but his
own reason weighed not so heavily with him as the
memory of Daphne's words.</p>

<p>"If I can be certain," he said, "that what I am
doing will produce good I will sacrifice myself, but I
will not sacrifice others, and that terrible crystal
which reflects thoughts as well as deeds shows me
that others are being sacrificed.</p>

<p>Kuthumi looked at him with a kind of sorrow rather
than anger. "And for such a poor thing," he said,
"are you determined to let all go?"</p>

<p>"What else can I do?" said Julian, suddenly aroused
into a feeling of passionate expostulation; "if Morial
would act, as I would act in his place, if he would let
me use that crystal as Daphne used it, tell her the
truth about everything, and guard her against those
who are cheating and telling falsehoods, then I would
suffer anything, I would endure anything."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Kuthumi, "but then you have no right
to dictate to the Master. He knows best his own
methods."</p>

<!-- page 251 -->

<p>"I am not fit for the life," was Julian's reply, "and
I suppose I have wrecked my own life; but even if
it be so, nevertheless, those whom I have loved and
trusted must remain my first care, and, in spite of all
you say, I cannot permit Daphne to be made a tool
of liars and cheats while I live."</p>

<p>"Be it so," said Kuthumi, with the same perfect
composed sweetness of manner, "but if you retain
that decision, and, from what I see, I fear you will,
you cannot live long."</p>

<p>Julian was about to make some answer to these ominous
words, but his voice died away before he said anything,
for Kuthumi was no longer there. He vanished
from before Julian's eyes like a mist before the sun.
He was gone in an instant, and there was his chair
standing where he had placed it. Julian was so surprised
at this sudden departure, that he sat there for
a few moments, gazing at the vacant chair. Why
had Kuthumi left him so suddenly, what could this
mean?</p>

<p>It was nearly dusk, but not quite, in London at this
moment. Daphne, who had had a terrible day, not
exactly of altercation, but of obstinately sticking to

<!-- page 252 -->

her own resolutions, and listening to the other side,
had gone wearily up to her own room for a little quiet
and rest. She was thinking of Julian, a terrible conviction
had come upon her that she would never see
him again. As she went up the dim stairs, gray with
the coming evening, and yet not lighted, a vision
passed quickly before her, which made her hesitate a
moment. In the flash of illumination she had seen
Julian and her supernatural visitor holding their conversation.
The vision was gone instantly, and she
recovered herself and went on her way, but a moment
later she saw a figure before her, which she recognised.
It was standing in the doorway of her own
room, and as she approached it, it receded, and, entering
the room, awaited her. It was Kuthumi, as she
had seen him a second before, in her vision, but real
now as any man. Kuthumi with his perfect sweetness
of manner, which would disarm even the most suspicious
person. Daphne saw that some great trial
was before her, and without saying a word, or showing
any feeling, she went straight into her room, and
closed the door behind her. And then she stood and
faced this unexpected visitor.</p>

<!-- page 253 -->

<p>"I am glad to see that you are not alarmed," said
Kuthumi, "at my appearance here. Do you know
that you stand in great danger? I have come to warn
you. You have disobeyed the Master himself. He
can crush you instantly if he chooses, but instead of
that he would rather save you, and therefore I have
come to try and show you how foolish your deeds
are."</p>

<p>"Show me, then," said Daphne, "what you would
have me do."</p>

<p>"The mistake you are making," said Kuthumi, very
gently and persuasively, "is to think that you are to
judge for yourself. That is not so; you must let those
who know more than you judge for yourself."</p>

<p>"But I cannot yield," said Daphne, "I must know
what I am doing, and I must understand it."</p>

<p>"If you adhere to this," said Kuthumi, "you mark
out for yourself a future of horrible suffering. You
cannot thus set your Master at defiance without drawing
upon yourself the fires of expiation. Be warned.
Do you wish to see Julian Arundel again?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Daphne, "I do wish to see him
again."</p>

<!-- page 254 -->

<p>"He is in your Master's hands," said Kuthumi,
"powerless in his hands, and it depends on you
whether he lives or dies. Obey the Master, and such
teachers as he shall choose to set over you, and all
will be well. Set him at defiance, as you do now,
and Julian Arundel's life must be sacrificed. Your
influence with Julian is so great that he feels it, even
the other side of the world."</p>

<p>Daphne's face lit up with a brilliance that made
her look positively angelic. She clasped her hands
with a gesture of delight.</p>

<p>"Is it possible," she said, "that I saw Julian the
other night? did he hear my voice? has he responded?
is that why you have come to tempt me? You cannot
do it," she said, and as she spoke she seemed
transfigured. "I would rather let Julian die than
have him return to me with his conscience and honour
broken and ruined. I would rather never see
him again than when he returned I should have lies
on my soul that I could never wipe out. No, Morial
is a black master, I know it, and I repudiate him."</p>

<p>As she spoke she raised her hand with the same gesture
that she used when Julian saw her in the crystal,

<!-- page 255 -->

and the same majesty transformed her figure, and
it was scarcely recognisable. She did not know her
own power, she could not realise it; those who are
inspired never can. But she was startled to see that
she had so readily silenced her tempter. Kuthumi
faded from before her; as she spoke he was gone.</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER XXIII.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> this extraordinary interview, Daphne remained
standing and thinking deeply, forgetting what she
had come to her room for, and that she was tired,
and wished to rest. Her whole mind was absorbed
in her strange position, and trying hard how to act.
While she remained thus lost in thought, a knock
came to the door, and the servant, entering, gave her
a little note, which she took mechanically, without
even thinking who it came from, or what it might
mean. But the servant waited, saying that she had
been specially asked to take back an answer. Opening
it, Daphne saw it was from Mr. Gray, begging
her to come down to him at once into the drawing-room,
and speak to him. She decided immediately
to do so, for it was evident that he had some important
reason for sending to her in this way, as they
met continually in the ordinary manner during the
day.</p>

<p>"Tell Mr. Gray I will come down at once," she said.</p>

<p>In a very few moments she went into the big room,

<!-- page 257 -->

which at this time was deserted. It was all lit up for
the evening, when there was to be a great meeting.
Lord Ferdinand Abchurch was to become a member
of the new sect, and a member of the inner circle of
chosen disciples on this evening, and preparations
were made for a full gathering; but no one was yet
in the great room, except Mr. Gray, who was pacing
impatiently up and down, awaiting Daphne's entrance.</p>

<p>"Miss Royal," he said, "I have to-day made a
great discovery. Chance favoured me in that I know
one of the firm of lawyers whom Miss Riga employs.
I daresay what I have done seems unpardonable in
your eyes, and indeed I can hardly justify it to myself.
I know that I was not intended to know, and I have
devoted myself to obtaining this knowledge, but now
I have it, whatever you think of me, I will use it,
that is to say, I will try and explain to you your position."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" said Daphne, "I
don't understand you."</p>

<p>"Are you still intending to leave this country with
Mrs. Flite?" asked Gray.</p>

<!-- page 258 -->

<p>Daphne sighed, "I suppose so," she said. "I don't
intend to go if I can help it, but after all it would be
a trifling thing to what I am expected to do here.
Once away from my aunt I cannot be expected,
surely, to deceive people, as she wishes me to now.
I am speaking very plainly, you see, Mr. Gray, but
you know so much that there is no reason why I
should not."</p>

<p>"I know a great deal, indeed," said Gray, "I
know you have signed a power of attorney to your
aunt, which gives her absolute control over all
your possessions during your absence, and I know
that Julian gave you power of attorney when he left.
And as soon as she has got you out of this country,
she has both of your estates under her absolute
control. Now that I have put it as plainly as that,
do you see why you have been asked to leave this
country?"</p>

<p>"Surely she cannot be as bad as that?" said
Daphne.</p>

<p>"I may be very wrong in my estimate of human
nature," said Mr. Gray; "but I think if you allow
her to carry out all your plans, that if you ever return

<!-- page 259 -->

to this country, you will find both yourself and Julian
penniless."</p>

<p>"But my aunt, what will she do?" said Daphne.</p>

<p>"Oh, that I cannot say," said Gray. "But I should
say that you will never see her again, unless some
strong controlling hand is put upon her."</p>

<p>"But surely it will be," cried Daphne. "The
Master is a reality&mdash;I have seen him. Surely he
will not allow all this to be done, merely for that one
person's benefit."</p>

<p>"I cannot answer you," said Gray, "I cannot
understand it. I am certain that you and Julian both
believe in your visions, but I know that Miss Riga
doesn't believe in them; and if the Master whom
you see is using her as a tool, he must be bad himself
to use so bad a tool, and to allow such methods
to be adopted."</p>

<p>"I have defied him," said Daphne. "I have no
mercy to expect from him; and now I am prepared
to defy her, now that I see this as you put it before
me. I see how awful it appears when one looks at
it from your point of view. I know so little of the
value of money, that I think nothing of my losses,

<!-- page 260 -->

but I do think a great deal of her gain, wrought by
so terrible means; and, knowing how wicked her
methods are, I can believe that she never intends me
to return, and that is why Mrs. Flite is to go with
me."</p>

<p>Daphne spoke with that terrible conviction of
treachery which shows that no further argument is
needed.</p>

<p>"I have been trying to think what to do," said
Gray. "You must get those papers back. You
must remember that, even if you are willing to give
everything you possess to that woman, you have no
right to give everything that Julian possesses."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see it plainly," said Daphne. "I see that
I shall be doing a dishonourable thing; I shall fail
at my post of trust. In his absence I am simply his
steward, and he gave me that power of attorney
because he trusted me. I shall not fail," she said,
"to cry out in fear," and without another word she
went away, leaving Gray in the room to ponder.</p>

<p>In two hours more that room was filled with a
large gathering of the faithful. That was what Miss
Riga called them; what they actually were, who can

<!-- page 261 -->

tell? Some, indeed, were very earnest, some were
ready to sacrifice everything; but, no doubt, many,
like Mrs. Flite, were looking out for a happy hunting-ground
of some sort or the other. However, they
were there, and presented a goodly show, and all
seemed in equal earnest. Lord Abchurch came quite
early, for he was greatly interested in the whole matter,
and having made up his mind to understand it, was
determined to do so thoroughly. It seemed that Mrs.
Flite was deputed to entertain him, for she kept close
to him during the time before the actual proceedings
of the evening began. Miss Riga never came in
until the last moment, making always a theatrical
kind of entrance; and to-night, Gray, who was
watching everything with great interest, noticed also
that Daphne did not come until the last moment.
He was in a very silent humour that evening. He
had so much to think of, and was glad that Mrs.
Flite devoted herself to Lord Ferdie. He was watching
the two closely, because they interested him
more than anyone else, until Daphne appeared,
when he saw Lord Ferdie start violently. Mrs.
Flite had just put her lace handkerchief to her mouth,

<!-- page 262 -->

and a look of triumph was on her face. A look of
anxiety and surprise was on Lord Ferdie's. In his
hand was a crimson rose, which had fluttered to him,
as it seemed, from the ceiling. He held it up, and
looked at it in great amazement. A flutter of excitement
passed through the whole room, for this miracle
had been worked in full conclave, and before the
eyes of the full meeting.</p>

<p>"Look at it, Lord Ferdie," said Mr. Foster, "it is
sure to contain a letter from the Master;" and at
these words everyone instantly drew a little nearer,
and Lord Ferdie found himself the centre of a curious
group. He pressed the rose gently, and drew from
out the petals a folded paper. He opened it slowly,
and under the scrutiny of all those curious eyes.</p>

<p>"Is it an order?" said an awed voice at last.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand it," said Lord Ferdie, "it
seems to be written in some unknown language."</p>

<p>"Sanscrit, probably," said Gray. "I can read it,
Ferdie, if it is so. Let me look."</p>

<p>At that moment Daphne's voice was heard, and
Gray turned with a start, very much surprised that
she was in the room. She was standing in the archway,

<!-- page 263 -->

half hidden by the curtain, and now came
forward.</p>

<p>"I have been here some moments," she said, speaking
deliberately, and yet with a strong and subdued
excitement. "I have seen all that has happened. It
is not worth your while to read that message, Mr.
Gray; that is not a message from the unseen. Mrs.
Flite is very clever, and has learned her business
admirably, but I saw her throw the rose, although
perhaps no one else did."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, some one did," said Gray very drily,
"and I have seen her do it before."</p>

<p>Miss Riga was in the room by this time, and Mrs.
Flite started from her chair and approached her.</p>

<p>"There is a conspiracy against us," she said, in a
voice almost inarticulate, with a mingling of passion
and terror.</p>

<p>Daphne turned upon them.</p>

<p>"No, it is no conspiracy," she said. "I am speaking
the truth and intend to speak the truth. I came
into this room with that intention to-night. When I
saw so many drawn into this network of deceit, I
resolved, come what might, I would speak, and tell

<!-- page 264 -->

what I knew, and just as I entered the room I saw
this trick played before my eyes. The credulous,
who have believed so much, never paused to question
but truly no one fresh from the outer world,
could be so easily deceived," and as she said this
she turned to Lord Ferdie.</p>

<p>He rose, and coming to her side, "No," he said, "I
was not deceived." He spoke very quietly, but the
words evidently struck terror into the hearts of the
two conspirators. They both looked at him with
glances of dismay.</p>

<p>"I have much more to say than this," said Daphne,
and the amazed, eager little crowd drew back from
her as she drew herself up and addressed them, with
a peculiar manner, which made her seem like an
inspired priestess.</p>

<p>"I have to tell you," she said, "that I have seen
this thing from the beginning, and that not only are
the grand words that are used, reduced to mere
meaningless jargon, because they are in the mouths
of people who use them for a bad end; not only are
the great thoughts drawn from the old religions debased
and degraded, because they are used as the

<!-- page 265 -->

screen for selfish and wicked actions. All that would
be unintelligible, because we all know that the ordinary
human being is imperfect and evil. But I have
to say, too, I have myself seen the Master who initiated
this movement and that he, so far as I can judge,
is as evil as the creatures whom he uses." As she
said this she turned with a magnificent gesture to the
portrait of Morial, the doors of which were always
unlocked and thrown open for these special gatherings,
and instead of addressing the people about
her, she addressed her next words to the portrait
itself.</p>

<p class="center">* * * *</p>

<p>Julian, left to himself, experienced a sense of loneliness
which had never befallen him before. All
hope, all ambition, seemed killed by Kuthumi's terrible
words. Morial as a guide and a teacher was destroyed
for him. What had he learned from this monster
of selfishness, that he should wish to know?
Nothing! The only thing that he desired to do was
to save Daphne from the terrible consequences of the
position in which she was placed, but he was powerless
to do this, was powerless as though he were

<!-- page 266 -->

dead, here in this remote, unexplored region. When
his mind reverted to this, a longing to see and know
what was happening drew him, almost without
thought, from the room in which he had been sleeping,
to that in which the crystal hung. He had no
thought of Morial, or of anything else in the world&mdash;except
what was happening in his own home. The
crystal was clouded when he reached it, and he set
himself to will that this cloud should clear, and he
should see the truth. It did clear, as if in obedience
to his will, and he saw the gathering which we have
seen in the great drawing-room. He heard Daphne's
words, and a kind of terror came upon him when he
saw her address herself to the portrait, for he knew
by experience and by intuition that if she commanded
Morial he must obey her, and if she did this to-night
the final battle between them must come, and he
dreaded that she would be the one that would be
crushed. While he was thinking this, he heard her
voice ring out, clear and plain, "Morial, I command
you. I have found that by some mysterious power
I can make you obey me; you who profess to be the
ruler of the world, I command you to listen to me now,

<!-- page 267 -->

that I denounce you as a spirit of evil. You have
knowledge and you have power, you are a Master,
but you are a black Master. You put evil thoughts
into men's minds, you corrupt them, you lead them
into fatal positions, from which they can never escape,
and then you make them your helpless tools. I
know that Miss Riga wants the money which rich
believers bring; but you want more, you want their
souls and their consciences, and their whole lives to
be sacrificed to your monstrous selfishness, and you
would make them as evil as yourself. Answer
me," she said with an air of command which surpassed
any possibility which seemed to lie within herself,
a manner which seemed visibly inspired. "Answer
me, I command you." And then at this moment
there came upon Julian the awful sense which he had
experienced before when Daphne called him. Morial
had come at her command, and again it seemed as
if she saw him in person, for she turned from the
portrait, and directly faced the place where Julian
stood, and where Morial stood beside him.</p>

<p>"I denounce you," she cried. "I know you to be
a Master of the Black Art, and a servant of the devil;

<!-- page 268 -->

I invoke the pure Spirit of Truth to withstand your
Jesuitical casuistries. I call upon the inner power
of good which dwells in every man to withstand
your subtle temptations; and I demand that the Pure
Spirit which enlightens the world shall destroy you."</p>

<p>Julian, listening intently to these words, forgot that
he stood close to the Master to whom she addressed
these words, but Morial's presence was recalled to
his memory by a terrible stifled cry which seemed
like no human sound that he had ever heard. He
turned and looked, expecting to see something
terrible and agonising, some mortal struggle for life.
What he did see was simply the statue-like figure of
the beautiful youth, whose fascinations had been so
great. Looking back, he saw that the crystal was
clouded, and terrified that he should not know the
result of Daphne's inspired effort, he approached
Morial hastily, and, touching him, to his horror, it
was as though he had touched, not merely marble
only, but ice. He recoiled from the chill of this
contact, and as he did so he heard a cry of despair,
a wail as of a lost spirit, and he recognised the voice
of Kuthumi. And he heard this voice speak. "He is

<!-- page 269 -->

gone," it said, "where shall we find another in the
world to join us. The mystic number is destroyed,
He is gone." The voice died away. Julian looked
at the crystal, but it was dark again. He approached
Morial's figure, but it was fixed, immovable, and
colder than death. A horror fell upon him, which
was uncontrollable; this exquisite form, this beautiful
face, filled him with a sense of terror, now that this
smile had gone, and those eyes were helpless. Led
by an uncontrollable impulse, he rushed out of the
room, and throwing back the curtain from the doorway
escaped into the outer air. But as he did so
he almost fell across the lifeless figure of the panther
which lay upon the threshold. Recovering himself
he went on, and reached the lawn. The sun was
high, and it seemed to have scorched the very ground
on which he stood, for the verdure had vanished,
where the velvet turf had been, it was all parched
and harried. In spite of the heat of the sun, a bitter
wind, ice-cold, blew across the valley. It appeared
to have killed the flowers which had bloomed in
such quantities, for on every side they drooped and
hung lifeless on their stalks. The sight was horrible,

<!-- page 270 -->

and affected Julian with a new terror. He turned, and
rushed back to the other side of the hermitage, to that
place where he knew the great black horse Agape
dwelt in a charmed stable. The great horse had
been his friend before, and it seemed to him that in
this strong animal life there would be some comfort.
He flung wide the door, and rushed in, longing to
touch the creature, and feel its burning breath. It
had before now saved him from death. The horse
stood there, but Julian's artistic eye told him instantly
that life was gone; that the splendid form
before him was a statue of ebony, fixed and immovable
as the rock in which the charmed stable
was hewn. With an awful cry he flung himself at
the feet of this majestic statue, and in one moment
the shock had silenced the questioning brain, and he
had found the eternal quiet of death.</p>
