<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="small">INTRODUCES AN OLD VIRGINIA FAMILY.</p>

</div>

<p>I AM the undistinguished and not very
flourishing member of an old Virginia
family. I am the daughter of a planter&mdash;whose
broad acres stretch away for
miles&mdash;whose cattle dot the distant slopes&mdash;whose
bending fields wave as far as the
eye can reach&mdash;whose home is an old-fashioned
Virginia home.</p>

<p>We, the Rushtons, are a branch of an
old federal family of talent, prejudice,
and unpopularity. Among our immediate
ancestors we number a colonel, a member
of Congress, a respectable house-carpenter,
a mad gentleman, several thrifty
landholders, one genius, and one beauty.
There are others among our ancestors who
are suppressed in the family history, for
reasons best known to grandma and aunt
Ph&oelig;be Braxley, who always close the
doors, and stuff the key-holes, whenever
they hold a confab over these suppressed
individuals. These honest old Virginia
families do not like to disillusionate people
who are kind enough to take their word
for the good conduct of their progenitors.
I am quite sure if papa were to overhear
grandma and aunt Braxley, dabbling into
these family secrets, he would soon put
a stop to their confidential disclosures. I
need not say to the intelligent reader, that
it is the keenest delight of grandma's life
to conjure up these proscribed individuals.
She gloats over their misdeeds, and she,
and Mrs. Braxley, will steal off from the
gayest companies to con over this dark
page in the family history.

<!-- page 78 col 2 -->

I dislike to be formal, but there are
little ceremonies which cannot be comfortably
neglected, and I now beg to present
to my readers the various members of our
family, who are left to cheer up the wide
halls, and well-furnished apartments, of
the old hill house.</p>

<p>First, we have grandma, Mrs. Barbara
Rushton, the sole surviving link of a generation
which has passed away. She is a
little, straight, plump, weasel-looking,
keen, shrewd, voluble old lady, with clattering
knitting-needles, and tongue of
rare speed and bottom. She sports a
black satin on gala days, and an illusion
cap. She is fond, to this day, of fashion
plates, and would not, for the world, offend
the authorities in the cap of a sleeve,
or the trimming of a collar. She is the
embodiment of terror to giggling servant-maids,
and mischievous boys. Dogs, with
any pretensions to sagacity, instinctively
avoid her; and the old house cat can
snooze more comfortably on the opposite
side of the hearth. Mrs. Barbara Rushton,
being in a state of savage warfare with
the nineteenth century, thinks it her duty
to express her opinion on all subjects, and
to make some people know their places.
She attacks servants from all points, and
is possessed of the gift of ubiquity. Being
a lady of property, she keeps her own
maid, who makes nothing of wishing she
had a hundred arms, and fifty pairs of
legs, so perplexing, multifarious, and
pressing, are the duties devolving upon the
honored body-servant of Mrs. Barbara.</p>

<p>I now present my father, Mr. Dabney

<!-- page 79 col 1 -->

Rushton, a gentleman of stately presence,
stern politics, retiring habits, and princely
hospitality. I am afraid his <i>otium cum
dignitate</i> is rather burdensome, and that
his aristocratic pretensions somewhat
hinder the free <i>use</i> of his limbs, and
overwhelm his luxurious days with
<i>ennui:</i> but I never heard him say in all
my life, that he was tired sitting in his
library, or that it was at all fatiguing to
act the gentleman of elegant leisure. I
have only regretted in my unsophisticated
way, that he was obliged to yawn out his
winter days, and sleep and fan out his
summer ones; being too much of a landholder
and slaveholder to condescend to
any bodily work, and not inclining particularly
to disarrange the books on the
shelves of his library.</p>

<p>Next we have my mother, Mrs. Theodora
Rushton, a lady quiet, pale, pious,
and lady-like, but much addicted to spoiling
her children, and over-indulging her servants.
Like all Virginia mothers, she
looks much older than she really is, and
persists in wearing caps over her rich
auburn hair, which grandma declares are
several years too old for the oldest inhabitant.
Mamma worries her days out over
the servants, who seldom heed a word she
says, and is always wondering what she
had better have for dinner.</p>

<p>My brother, Mr. Robert Ashley Rushton.
This remarkably handsome gentleman
possesses many claims to the reader's
notice, having spent a great deal of money
at college, and being still industriously
engaged in digging a large hole in the paternal
estate. He is a noble, lordly, careless,
dashing fellow of twenty-one. Papa
likes to hear him talk, and see him swell.
He is such a royal buck, with such a free
off-hand manner, and Ciceronian flow of
words. This young gentleman walks over
mamma like a Juggernaut. She follows
him with her eyes, and listens at him
with her ears, and thanks Heaven that
she has such a son. He goes slashing
about, and is the wonder and admiration
of all the lady visitors, and servants about
the house. He comes down late of mornings,
with dressing-gown on, and newspaper
in hand, and reads, and sips his coffee
after the latest and most approved manner,
while mamma sits patiently beside the coffee-pot,
looking fondly on. He says it
was ordained that I should carry the
family nose, and hopes I do not find it at
all burdensome. He has his own servant
and groom, who hold themselves above
the other servants. He has what he
calls a span of horses, and a hunter. He
goes to Old Point in July, and to the
White Sulphur in August, where he cuts
quite a figure he says. He has grand and

<!-- page 79 col 2 -->

foreign visitors, who take the whole plantation
when they come. On these interesting
occasions mamma puts on the black
silk, and papa appears in varnished boots,
and strangely cut hair. Louise is sent
for from aunt Braxley's, and a round of
dinners, visits, hunting, fishing, and pick-nicking,
takes place all in the good old
English style. Every thing is out of
joint, old family rules and regulations entirely
disregarded. Late breakfasts, late
dinners, and midnight suppers, intrude
upon our regular family arrangements.
Hounds, and horns, and hunters, and servants,
and juleps, and champagne, create
such anarchy, and confusion, that Mrs.
Barbara generally gathers up her maid
and shadow, Epsey, and retreats to her
room in high dudgeon. Mr. Robert is
very fond of our sister Louise. He considers
her a trump, he says.</p>

<p>Our sister Louise has all the peculiar
charms of a Virginian country lady, high
born and rich. Her time, and good looks,
have never been frittered away upon balls,
routs, and empty chit-chat. Neither have
her delicate fingers been hardened and
reddened by rubbing, scrubbing, cooking,
washing, cleaning, and all those wonderful
operations carried on by the stirring
ladies of the north. This young creature
has the gracious, kind manner of those
who rule&mdash;the inborn pride of birth; the
native generosity and loftiness of the nobles
of her state. Added to this, she has
the ease and superb indolence of an Oriental
beauty. The perfect consciousness of
superiority, requiring no eagerness for display.
The magnificent repose and flowing
outline of untasked perfection. Here
are no angles, no quick, fidgety, restless,
uneasy seekings for effect. No show, no
ostentation, no pomp, but unconscious dignity
and ease, combined with the animation
and flexibility of youth. Her step is
royal, and her lifted head superb. Fire
sleeps beneath the alabaster, and courses
through fine veins of purple tint.</p>

<p>Louise has the long, black lash, the hidden,
mysterious, lambent eye of the South,
and the pure, clear, moonlight face, so peculiar
to ladies born under a Virginian
sky. She has, also, the small arched
head, Grecian brow, undulating figure,
and dainty feet of the lustrous beauties of
the tropics. She is not impetuous, not
daring, but unconquerable and firm. One
of those fair, startling creations we see
gliding like moonlight visions, here and
there; consolidating in one bright gem all
the far-famed beauties and frailties of woman's
nature. She is beautifully timid,
and fearfully bold; showing the strength
of the lion, and the meekness of the dove.
Thrilling, provoking, indolent, passionate,

<!-- page 80 col 1 -->

variable, mysterious. Men die of love of
these creatures, while the favored one
exults. There is no sacrifice they would
not endure, no whim they cannot exhibit,
no trifle they cannot pursue, no danger
they cannot confront. Keenly sensitive
to ridicule, jealous guardians of the delicacy
of the sex, ever alive to the slightest
breach of gallantry or tenderness, these
creatures wield weapons of their own,
scorning woman's rights, elections and
politics. They would not enter the arena,
they would not be jostled by the crowd.
They know familiarity breeds contempt,
and they stand aloof, fair and angelic,
enlisting all the latent chivalry of that
sex, who boast that they can be led
through interminable labyrinths, but cannot
be driven an inch. Well do these fair
creatures know that their weakness is
their strength; their delicacy the seat of
their power; their dependence their protection,
and their smiles the axis upon
which the busy world turns.</p>

<p>These idle, luxurious Virginians love by
chance. They never <i>calculate</i>. They
love honor, and generosity, and refinement,
when well gotten up and exquisitely embodied.
They love, and they never change.
Happy he who first pleases the eye, and
is then thought worthy of the heart.
Be he planter or beggar, he is loved. I
have seen these high-born, gloriously proportioned
creatures, being married to a
pair of whiskers, or a moustache, after a
trial of constancy and heroic endurance of
years. They are the impersonation of
truth, and cannot understand falsehood.
Hence they are often deceived by fortune-hunters,
coming from afar, with handsome
persons, selfish hearts and nimble tongues.
Indolent, opulent, dreamy, ideal and concentrative,
love, and sometimes hate, absorbs
their very being. They are dangerous
beauties, men say, with their glorious
flounces and headlong darts.</p>

<p>My sister Louise is the idol of the young
men, a pet of aunt Braxley's, and the
pride of Mr. Robert Rushton's heart.
She is so fair, so unsuited to rough it
and tough it here below, so unfitted to
encounter the wear and tear of life, that
it is the business of our family to shield
her and guard her like a rare exotic;
and she is to be spared, by our exertions,
the common pains and ills of our
mortal lot.</p>

<p>As to myself, I am, dear reader, the
humblest of narrators. I am the family
knitter and darner, and am decidedly more
useful than ornamental. I am called
Jenny, after somebody I presume. Grandma
does not think I will ever get married.
She sees no earthly possibility of my ever
having a beau, and darkly and alarmingly

<!-- page 80 col 2 -->

hints that, when girls begin to knit at the
rate I knit, the game of a young lady's
life is up for them. She thinks my prospects
would have been better if I had not
thought proper to bring back into this
world Peggy Rushton's nose, and Buck
Rushton's top lip, which, as a sincere
friend of the family, she had fondly hoped
were buried with Peggy and Buck, both
of whom, it seems, died in a state of single
blessedness. She advises me to become a
missionary to Feejee, or some jumping-off
place or other, and to write a book on
cannibals, their probable destiny and present
uses, as a complete damper to the
outrageous pretensions of the nineteenth
century. This cannibal book, she says,
she intends as a pill for some folks, and a
cap, which it will be surprising to see how
many it will fit. She regales me on drizzly
days and misty evenings with anecdotes
of her triumphs and conquests, and
informs me that she has rejected nearly
every distinguished man of her day. She
hopes mutton-ham sleeves will soon come
back, for they were so becoming to her
figure, and wonders who, in the name of
common sense, sets the fashions nowadays.
Whoever it is, she says, that person
has a spite against her, and is only
one of the numerous enemies furnished
her by the nineteenth century. But the
greatest enemy she has in the world is
the man, or demon, who invented a gentleman's
sacque coat. She is sure if gentlemen
could only see their own backs
they would feel ashamed of themselves,
and if her grandson, Robert Rushton, will
persist in wearing them, she respectfully
requests that he will back out of her presence
and keep out of her sight.</p>

<p>But, dear reader, we must descend to
particulars. We must leave off stretching
and enter, heart and soul, into the cares
and joys of our old Virginia family of the
good old school.</p>

<p>Spring! dear delicious spring is come at
last&mdash;but she has been with us before.
She came with fair blue skies and southern
breezes, early in February, to look up
sunny sides and sheltered nooks for her
first-born. And then, old winter frowned
upon her, shaking his hoary locks savagely,
until she stole away, leaving the
tender buds of her care to bear up against
many a chilling blast, and icy breath, ere
the day of promise come. March came
rushing headlong upon us, determined to
conquer or to die. But like many a bristling
warrior, he was by gentleness o'ercome,
and yielded in his truly good-natured
way, turning the keen edge of his
blasts, and telegraphing to his snows that
they had better come down as showers, or

<!-- page 81 col 1 -->

they would be pretty badly received. Accordingly,
these piping blasts turned about
and gave us cooling breezes, and the snows
came gently from their heavenly heights
as fragrant showers, and the sun's eye
grew melting and tender, and old March
turned upon his heel and made his exit.
And with him, the whole pack of unwelcome
storms, Jack-frosts, heavy snows,
and pelting hails.</p>

<p>Now the long, warm, languid days are
come. Children, and thinly-coated, lambs
grow frisky, and fine ladies grow dull and
take a blue pill. Ho! for the country
now! Ho! for the ploughed fields and
green wheat! Milkmaids are exalted,
and opera-girls, and ballet-troupes, and
tinsel and glare are gone out with the gas.
Ploughmen walk erect, and the brindle
cow lies down to ruminate in the early
shade, for city folks are sketching them,
and the picturesque is the order of the
day. The tall old pines look rusty beside
the dainty pea-green of the oaks. Red
berries and evergreens have had their day,
and the holly needs a new suit. Straw
bonnets are all the go, and the broad brim
of the palm-leaf hat looks tempting. The
old country-house begins to stir, rubbing
up, and yawning at windows and doors
until it is wide awake. Beds are sunning
on the flat-crowned cedar hedges, carpets
are beaten, walls are whitewashed, floors
are scoured, maids are running with buckets
of water, and jostling each other, and
passing merry words at every turn. Negro
dames, of grave demeanor and imperturbable
dignity, take off their party-colored
handkerchiefs, and turn out their
crisp locks to the sun. The cottage door
is opened, turning out its swarms of knotty
pates, and the old dame in the clean cotton
gown takes the wheel out upon the
grass, and keeps it buzzing all the long
fair day. Birds trill and warble and
chatter, and get up trios and quartettes
high up in their leafy homes, and mischief-loving
mocking-birds mock on, and bandy
merry, gladsome, light-hearted notes, until
the cool still hours of the night. Martens,
those gay absentees, return to their
summer residences, bringing troops of
lively chattering friends. Little chickens,
with grave countenances, go every morning
before any body is up, and scratch up
all the gardener's carefully-sown seed, aided
and abetted by their mammas, who
ought to know better. Cool shadows
thicken under the trees, and golden drops
of sunlight dance and flicker under the
low-hanging boughs. Light zephyrs sit
upon the waving branches, and swing and
quiver all the day. The cooing of the
dove comes up from the deep cool groves,
and the croaking of the sun-awakened

<!-- page 81 col 2 -->

frogs, fills up the pauses in the glad light
music of the Spring.</p>

<p>Master John feels lazy, and loiters on
his way to school, and wishes that he
could play like Jim and Ned, and wonders
what his papa wants to send him to
school for. Valetudinarians and hard-working
men complain that the nights are
getting too short for them. Housekeepers
pitch their voices an octave higher, and
get alarmed when people drop in to dinner.
Hot-beds are thrown open, and long-legged
plants run up, like gosling boys who
outgrow all their clothes. Lilacs and
jasmine are perfuming the rooms, and
adorning the vases on the mantel. Invalids
throw open their windows, and
thank God that they have lived to see another
spring. The cook pets the pig for
holiday, and the pig thinks "sufficient
unto the day, &amp;c." Ladies are seen out
in the gardens with long bonnets on, stooping
over flower-beds, and talking with the
gardener, who leans upon his hoe, and
points about with the air of a connoisseur.
Doctors have reluctantly dismissed all
obstinate coughs, pneumonias, and pleurisies,
and are lying in wait for those
delightful summer visitors, chills, and
typhoid and bilious fevers, having at
the same time, a most tender yearning
for dyspeptics, and for plethoric gentlemen
of luxurious habits. Meantime, as
though to dissipate all such charitable anticipations,
on the part of the soft-footed,
low-voiced, mysterious gentlemen, the glorious
sun, fresh and health-inspiring, rises
regularly every morning, and sets every
evening, per that time-honored oracle, the
Virginia and North Carolina Almanac;
and we are having the pinkest mornings,
and most sapphire evenings imaginable.</p>

<p>On the broad highway, where the wayward
road emerges from a dark pine
grove, and makes a sweeping bend, ere it
goes undulating afar&mdash;we pause. Here,
in the bend of the road, is the old hill
house&mdash;blessed Fairy Hill,&mdash;which has
been the family seat of the Rushtons,
since Sir William Berkeley's time. Here
is a large commodious dwelling, with a
good well of water, out-houses, and tobacco
fixtures in excellent repair, as the
newspapers would say; and here, in the
stately, old-fashioned house, before which
the road bends obsequiously, one can find
as much happiness, and charity, and eccentricity,
and pride, and old-fashioned
Virginia hospitality, as one need desire to
find anywhere. Here, the stranger may
ride and tie his horse, and halloo for the
groom, and enter, booted and spurred, if
he like, and be welcomed.</p>

<p>Here, the old organ-woman, and the
tambourine children, and the weary-looking

<!-- page 82 col 1 -->

monkey, may halt, and be fed. Here,
the beggar, ruddy and lithe of foot, may
come, and trump up any fancy sketch
of shipwreck, conflagration, avalanche, or
earthquake, and be politely trusted, kindly
relieved, and sent on his way with a
blessing. Here, the man with the sixteen
children, and bedridden wife, on the other
side of the water, all waiting to be brought
over by his means, delights to bi-annually
come, and tell his tale with its last additions,
and get his money, and chuckle to
himself as he goes along, wondering at
that charity which he cannot understand.
Here, the Yankee schoolmaster, the rawest
of all that honored fraternity, may come,
and cut rare didoes, and make ludicrous
mistakes, and call young ladies by their
Christian names, and the grinning servant-man
mister, and every thing else under
the sun "sauce," if such be his habit, and
he will never detect a smile, or awaken to
all the horrors of his situation, so long as
he lives. Here, the prosy parson may
talk, and talk, and talk, and no yawn will
ever warn him of the hour. Here, the
man brimfull of theories may open his
budget, and tell his plans, and have that
luxury to him, a listener. Here, the
busy world lulls, and the bustle and confusion
cease, and time ambles withal, and
one finds rest, and social pleasures, and
home comforts, and peace.</p>

<p>On one of those dreamy, delicious, body-relaxing,
soul-expanding, heaven-descending
days, mamma came to me with a look
of some importance, to say, that my brother's
friends, viz., Mr. Blanton, and his
sister, and the widow of the late Johnston
Blanton, were coming on a visit to
Fairy Hill, and that she wished to consult
with me about domestic matters. This
piece of news threw us into a panic. We
commenced active preparations immediately;
we overhauled the china-closet,
and made excursions into the pantry, and
clothes-presses. The family plate is rubbed
up, and servants are drilled, fattening
coops filled, and every body exhorted
to do their duty.</p>

<p>Louise is sent for, from aunt Braxley's,
and Robert invites his friend Frank Dashwood
to join the party. Mamma and I
have only a week for preparation. Assisted
by the housekeeper, and head servants,
mercilessly harassed by grandma,
we accomplish herculean feats. We arrange
the sweetest and most inviting chambers,
impart quite a learned and dignified
look to the old library, furbish up the
parlors, and touch up the summer-house,
arbors, and walks, for Louise, Dashwood,
and other lovers of romance. Robert
takes a snake-infested and dilapidated
grotto, and a very unpromising, briery,

<!-- page 82 col 2 -->

brawling, unmanageable spring, branch
in hand, and plays magic work in those
deep-shadowed and sequestered regions.
His man Sappingwood, who has an eye
for the picturesque, contrives rustic fixtures
admirably. Gnarled roots are
turned into rude but inviting seats, vines
into swings and festoons. The brawling
brook is cleared of all obstacles, and comes
tripping down the hill-side into a bright
pool, where it gurgles and dimples at the
grotto's foot. Into this pool, little fishes
are thrown, and from the cool banks the
noontide heat is warded off. Mr. Robert
looks around upon his handiwork complacently,
and declares that he intends to
talk love to the widow here, in a strain
unsurpassed in poetry or prose, and thinks,
upon his honor, that there are not many
of the softer sex who could withstand
the grotto, the pool of water, and himself.
Papa submits to be measured by
Robert's tailor, and mamma, poor, unambitious
mamma, thinks the black silk will
do, and, instead of purchasing new spring
dresses, concludes to lay in an extra supply
of butter, eggs, and chickens.</p>

<p>Louise comes home with a straw-colored
bar&egrave;ge, which throws quite a halo over
her clear complexion, and a blue silk,
which makes her pale and madonna-like,
and a pink tissue, which envelops her in
faint <i>coleur de rose</i>, together with any
number of little quaker morning wrappers
and coquettish coiffures, and numerous
little trifles of the toilette, which are of
so much importance to pretty ladies, and
alas! so hopelessly useless in the case of
ugly ones.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">OURSELVES AND OUR GUESTS.</p>

</div>

<p>"I SAY, Jenny, this room is badly arranged,"
said Louise to me, after all our
preparations were completed, and we were
in hourly expectation of our guests.</p>

<p>"I look confoundedly green about the
mouth," said Robert, looking towards a
mirror, "there is a bad light somewhere;
where is it?"</p>

<p>"I suspect it is from the window opening
upon papa's shrubbery, which, you
know, he says must be opened," said I.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! and we are to have a bad
light. Louise, you look cadaverous."</p>

<p>"<i>Can</i> it be the new carpet?" asked my
sister.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, the new carpet is
abominable. Have we had the yellow
fever or not? Are we all going off into
ghastly jaundices immediately?" inquired
Robert, sinking down upon a sofa in
alarm. "Are we to be ghosts for papa,

<!-- page 83 col 1 -->

who doubtless selected these ghastly
greens, and dingy yellows, at the instigation
of some demon shopkeeper. Jenny
do close those blinds, and call Sap to me."</p>

<p>"Indeed, you are a pretty fellow," said
Louise, indignantly. "If I were Jenny,
you might call Sap yourself, and close the
blinds too, sir. I know where I can sit to
throw a rosy tint on me."</p>

<p>"Do you?" faintly ejaculated our brother.</p>

<p>Now, Sappingwood, who was seldom
out of hearing, entered, with his eternal
bow, closed the window, turned the blinds,
drew the curtains a shade closer together,
opened the folding-doors about the eighth
of an inch more, and glided about the
room, giving a touch here and a turn there,
until his master consulted the mirror, and
said the green shadow about the corners
of his mouth was no longer to be seen.
Sappingwood then gracefully retired, and
Mr. Robert Rushton's usual volubility returned.</p>

<p>"I say, Louise, when my widow comes,
you may hide your diminished head," he
began, in a half jocular way.</p>

<p>"<i>Your</i> widow! oh, you are a ghost, if
one may judge from appearances. Well,
Mr. Ghost, I am not afraid of your widow,
nor can I conscientiously consent to be
annihilated by her, even though it be
your ghostly pleasure."</p>

<p>"You should see her&mdash;everybody should
see her!" cried Robert.</p>

<p>"Oh! she is the dearest, loveliest, prattling
little creature in the world. She is
always as earnest and intent as a child.
She has some of the gravest and most
comic little ways, which, upon my soul,
no mortal of human organization can resist.
Her hair, my dear girl, is a lustrous,
changeable brown&mdash;not sandy, you
know," said our fastidious brother, with a
shudder.</p>

<p>"But nevertheless suggesting such an
idea," said Louise, laughing.

<p>"No&mdash;a thousand
times no!&mdash;but the color, the very
identical color of that deep, old-fashioned
black molasses I used to love so when I
was a boy."</p>

<p>"And the boy is father of the man, you
know," remarked Louise.</p>

<p>"Yes, I being
my own father, love those soft rippling
locks&mdash;perhaps, who knows? perhaps&mdash;
for the sweet associations which they unconsciously
recall! Philosophy befriend
me!" said Robert, plunging into a reverie.</p>

<p>"But do furnish the sketch of your
widow," said Louise.</p>

<p>"Eh! heigho&mdash;where was I? Well,
this widow with the remarkable hair is a
perfect gem of a woman. She has a little
son," said Robert, with a rueful countenance,
but with the sublime air of a martyr,

<!-- page 83 col 2 -->

"who is considered a very remarkable boy
for his age. Indeed, all boys are considered
remarkable boys for their ages, I
think; ah, they are a pair of cherubs, this
little fat Therese and her darling little
Adolphe! They frolick and gambol together,
and their soft caressings are beautiful
to behold. On him, the dear little
woman lavishes all that exuberance of affection,
for which the generality of mankind
would be so grateful. Upon him,
she bestows the overflowings of a heart
brimfull of tenderness. Dashwood says
she is deep&mdash;but upon my word she is no
such thing. Her eyes are like a pair of
clear, oval mirrors of the soul, and they
reflect faithfully every impulse, and untutored
thought which animates this
little being. You think <i>your</i> shoulders
and arms are fine, Louise, and, if I am not
mistaken, you set up for a model in that
way; but wait until you see Therese
dressed out for dinner, I advise everybody
to wait until then."</p>

<p>"I suspect she is very
handsome," said Louise. "Brother Dashwood
calls her a flirt, but for your sake, I
hope she is not. I shall love her, I shall
be obliged to love her, if she is, as you say,
a warm-hearted little creature, with pure
oval eyes and cheeks."</p>

<p>"And Miss Willianna
Blanton," continued Robert, "I must
prepare you for her. Indeed, I consider it
my bounden duty as master of ceremonies,
to prepare your nervous system, by some
judicious man&oelig;uvre, for the shock. Imagine,
young ladies, a long-limbed, long-necked
creature, very closely resembling
a crane. Having recovered from this effort
of the imagination, you can picture to
yourselves this crane-like concern advancing
upon you, with the stride of a Jack
heron, combined with the awkwardness
of an alarmed ostrich."</p>

<p>"Oh! my dear brother!" I ejaculated,
in dismay.</p>

<p>"With sloping&mdash;I may say falling-off
and dwindling-away shoulders, sandy
hair, and a pair of pink albino eyes. Then
this neck, the property evidently of some
crane, is turned out regularly at dinner,
I presume for anatomical observations.
Her arms are hung with bracelets of all
shapes and sizes, which they cannot fill
up; and are ruthlessly exposed in a very
naked and attenuated condition. These
highly ornamented extremities are frequently
dangerously chalked, and being
fond of hooking themselves on to gentlemen's
coat-sleeves, manage to carry on a
considerable business in the whitewashing
line. Finally, girls, she apes my widow!
She affects the innocent and artless,
you know, and audaciously apes my
inimitable Therese!"</p>

<p>"And Mr. Blanton&mdash;what of him?"</p>

<!-- page 84 col 1 -->

<p>"Old Hal&mdash;why he is a prim, long-legged
stork of a man&mdash;very stiff and particular.
He loved Therese once; but while
he was deliberating about making his proposal
to her, he learned, to his dismay,
that his brother's wedding day was fixed&mdash;and
he thus had the supreme satisfaction
of becoming the only brother of his
adorable. Rather a trial, wasn't it?
and a lesson to deliberators generally."
Here Robert ceased his admirable sketching,
and thought he heard carriage wheels
approaching. Our guests were coming.
I heard papa call Mike to run to the gate,
and every servant darted to his post.
There were two carriages, and a servant
on horseback; Miss Blanton, the little
Adolphe, and a maid, alighted from one
carriage. After this, Mr. Blanton, as stiff
as a poker, descended from the other carriage.
My brother ran nimbly up, and
gave his hand to Mrs. Blanton, who
sprang out, talking as fast as she could, and
gesticulating to Mr. Blanton, the happy
Robert, and her own maid, who emerged
from the carriage laden with dressing-cases,
and shawls.</p>

<p>Papa welcomed the new-comers in his
happiest manner. Mamma kissed the
cherub boy of Robert's widow; and the
whole party came up the walk to the house,
where they were met by Louise and myself.
Louise soon took possession of Mrs.
Blanton, who seemed delighted with every
thing in the world&mdash;running everywhere,
and admiring every thing, leaving Miss
Blanton and myself in an anxious state
about servants, chambers, luggage, and
baths.</p>

<p>In the course of time, Mrs. Blanton
sprang in at the unlucky window opening
upon papa's shrubbery, and consented to
be shown to her room, having made the
tour of the grounds, and caught some fish
with her own little hands, out of Robert's
pond, at the foot of the grotto.</p>

<p>We had scarcely settled the Blantons
ere Dashwood arrived, dusty and fatigued,
and was shown to his own room in Robert's
rather luxurious office-building.</p>

<p>Now, Sappingwood felt that his hour
was come. Mr. Dashwood had thought
proper to come on horseback, no doubt expecting
Sap to wait upon him. And Mr.
Blanton, poor, particular man, required
two servants; his own man to wait on
himself, and somebody else to wait on his
man&mdash;which latter duty plainly devolved
upon Sap.</p>

<p>Under these formidable circumstances,
I must do Sappingwood the justice to say,
that he was as nimble and active as it is
possible for a valet of human organization
to be.</p>

<p>The new maids were showered and

<!-- page 84 col 2 -->

sprinkled with compliments as he dashed
about with shaving-cans, dressing-cases,
boots, curling-tongs, and clothes-brushes.
Mr. Sappingwood, as he brushed by the
Blanton maids, had to regret that the gentlemen
had not brought their own men
with them, as in that comfortable event he
should have had more time to devote to
the ladies. He respectfully hoped that the
gentlemen would get shaved, and curled,
and pumped, in the course of time, and he
fervently wished he were fifty Saps, instead
of one.</p>

<p>About four o'clock, they were all dressed
for dinner. Therese, fairer and fresher, was
out upon the upper balcony with her little
boy, admiring the beautiful scenery around
Fairy Hill. My brother and Dashwood
were lounging in the office portico, looking
up, now and then, at the widow and her
boy, as they walked up and down the balcony.
Louise selected her straw-colored
bar&egrave;ge for her d&eacute;but, and had no cause to
hide her diminished head in Mrs. Blanton's
presence. The witching Therese, I must
confess, was rather a dumpy woman, and
decidedly inclining to <i>embonpoint</i>. But
my brother adored dimples at the points
of ladies' elbows, and upon their knuckles,
and he could overlook many minor defects
to secure these rare and all-important
beauties.</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that grandma positively
refused to make her appearance,
not being able to see why all the rules
and regulations of a highly respectable
family should be broken in upon, and totally
set at naught by Bob's friends: she
declined making her appearance at all.
For her part, she always dined at one
o'clock. Her ancestors, who were every
whit as good as the "Blarntons" (Mrs.
Barbara sounded her a's very broad, as
all aristocratic Virginians do) or the anybody-else's,
she was credibly informed
had always dined at one o'clock, and if
she couldn't have her dinner at one o'clock
she wouldn't have it at all. She begged
the privilege of eating a crust of bread
in her own son's house at any hour she
chose, and of keeping her room. Still,
she couldn't for the life of her see why a
respectable house was to be invaded in
this way by a chunky widow, a yellow
old maid, and what seemed to her to be a
man may-pole (Mr. Blanton); and if her
son, Dabney Rushton, was going to be
quietly led by the nose by that conceited
fellow Bob, who, she would take occasion
to say, used more tobacco than he'd ever
make&mdash;<i>she</i> wasn't; she'd keep her room
from now until the crack of doom, rather
than allow Bob to lead <i>her</i> by <i>her</i> nose.</p>

<p>The ladies and gentlemen were now assembled
in our large drawing-room. Miss

<!-- page 85 col 1 -->

Blanton appeared in a pink silk, very low
and with short sleeves; she wore a set
of emeralds, several serpentine bracelets,
and a heavy chatelaine. Therese was
dressed in a thin white muslin, very soft
and delicate, cool, and most artistically
arranged, which seemed to float about her
like a snowy summer cloud. This effect
was heightened by a long illusion scarf,
which half concealed her beautiful arms,
and wreathed about her pure white neck
like vapor, and was most coquettishly
worn. Mrs. Blanton wore no jewelry at
all; on her bosom she had a white rosebud,
and geranium leaf, gallantly given
by Robert.</p>

<p>Papa and mamma complimented the ladies,
hoped they were refreshed, said a
great many kind things, and exerted themselves
to be agreeable. Robert, exquisitely
dressed, put on airs, looked careless
and indolent&mdash;seemed rather to tolerate
papa and mamma&mdash;and gave people to understand
that they were really very good
sort of folks in their way.</p>

<p>Dashwood, handsome and fastidious,
was "spreading himself out," to use my
brother's expression, to conquer the whole
company at one sitting. Never was mortal
man so brilliant and delightful before
dinner, as was Dashwood on this occasion.
Master Alphonse, who was dressed out
quite fancifully, had a passage at arms
with his "<i>bonne</i>" as he called the severe
yellow person who presided over him.
This skirmish, at first very unpromising,
ended in quite a tender scene between
Robert and the widow; he begging permission
to dismiss the "<i>bonne</i>" and to
assume the whole responsibility of Alphonse,
and Therese earnestly declaiming
that he knew nothing about managing
children, and could do nothing with Alphonse
at all, while the little boy ran to
Robert and clung to him, as though with
childish instinct he had already recognized
in that gentleman his natural protector.</p>

<p>I say this was a tender scene, rendered
with great effect, and considerably heightened
by a dark background, composed
of Mr. Blanton, in a pair of tight boots,
looking savage, scowling, and distressingly
uncomfortable. In a few minutes Therese,
without any apparent effort, had her
brother-in-law by two of his stiff fingers,
telling him a string of anecdotes in her
voluble, earnest way, while he began visibly
to thaw under her genial smiles.</p>

<p>It is impossible for my pen to follow the
graceful movements of this gifted and select
company. My eyes were completely
fascinated by this easy, natural, and coquettish
little creature, Mrs. Blanton. She
seemed to have the warmest heart, the
most jocund smile, the archest ways, and

<!-- page 85 col 2 -->

the most untiring little tongue in the
world. Circling about, easy, and without
the slightest effort, saying naive things
with the naivest of airs, she was a very
witch of a little woman. Her presence
was like a charm; and people loved each
other better, and had more charity for
their neighbors, and their hearts were
warmer, when she was in their midst.</p>

<p>"I say, mamma, may I ride the pony?"
began Alphonse.</p>

<p>"The pony would run away with you,
and then poor mamma would have no dear
little Alphonse," said the little woman.</p>

<p>"No, he wouldn't; I would just hold
him so, sir, and draw him this way, and
saw him just so, and Sap says he would
pace like the very deuce, mamma," said
the little fellow, with great animation,
gesticulating all the while most admirably.</p>

<p>"Sap says! and pray who is Sap, Alphonse?"</p>

<p>"Sap; why don't you know Sap? don't
you know a yellow man, mamma, who
lives here? He makes faces at little boys,
and he says he ate up a little boy just
about my size once. I tell you, mamma,
he talks exactly like this Mr. Rushton;
not like the dark Mr. Rushton, but like
the one that sits by you so much."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Alphonse," said Robert,
laughing.</p>

<p>"You are not polite, sir," said Miss
Blanton.</p>

<p>"Well, aunty, he <i>does</i> talk like Mr.
Rushton, and when he walks, he steps
just so, exactly like Mr. Rushton."</p>

<p>Here every body laughed very much
at Alphonse, who was walking across the
room like that pink of valets, Sap.
I say every body laughed, but mamma
did not laugh, for she was painfully uneasy
about dinner, and actually afraid to
leave the room, because Robert would not
like it. He said fashionable ladies never
attended to their own dinners, indeed seldom
knew what was on the table till it
was uncovered. Poor mamma had unbounded
confidence in her son's knowledge
on all subjects. She therefore sat,
endeavoring to smile, while her thoughts
were with the dinner, which, for aught she
knew, might at that very moment be
spoiling in the kitchen. Divining her
forebodings, indeed, beginning to feel somewhat
alarmed myself, I glided out, and
found the housekeeper in a stew over the
soup. She declared it was not fit for a
dog to eat. She brought me a spoonful
to taste, and it was awful stuff. I could
liken its taste to nothing but a decoction
of turpentine. I ran to mamma's room
and gathered all the authorities I could
find,&mdash;Miss Leslie, Mrs. Randolph, and

<!-- page 86 col 1 -->

others, and returned to the kitchen armed
to the teeth.</p>

<p>"Have you pepper in that soup?" I
inquired, glancing over the receipt. "Yes.
missis," ejaculated the cook, wiping her
face with her apron and fanning violently.</p>

<p>"And celery seed pounded?"</p>

<p>She shook her head and the housekeeper
revived.</p>

<p>I now took the unfortunate soup in
hand, and before I was done with it, I am
sure it was dark enough, and highly
enough seasoned for the most <i>blas&eacute;</i> epicure.
I had the satisfaction, in ten minutes,
of bringing it to a clear purple color,
while it emitted an odor of great fragrance.
I fancy few young ladies, of a literary
turn, could have finished off that unpromising
soup as artistically as the
humble authoress of these pages. While
I stood, cookery book in hand, exulting
over my soup, the dining-room servant
rushed upon us to say, that Robert
said it was dinner time. People never
could be free and social until after dinner,
and Mr. Robert Rushton desired his compliments
to the housekeeper, and cook.
This report spread dismay and consternation
in our ranks. Every idea in the cook's
head immediately took flight, and the
housekeeper put men, women and children
to confusion. The spirit lamps burned
blue, and then expired. The soup threatened
to grow cold, and poor mamma was enduring
torture in the drawing-room. Having
got the soup off safely, I began to exhort
the discomfited housekeeper and cook
to keep calm, as the worst was over. I
went into the dining-room, and found matters
progressing finely here. After this,
I went into the back parlor to await the
summons which was to test my soup. Here
I found only Alphonse, riding about on
papa's walking-stick, on which he seemed
determined to practise until he learned
enough of horsemanship to be promoted
to the pony.</p>

<p>Dinner was announced, and Robert
came through the back-parlor with Mrs.
Blanton on his arm, to look after Alphonse.
I followed them into the dining-room,
determined to take a seat where I could
be of service to somebody during the
weighty ceremonies of dinner. I sat by
Mr. Blanton, who wore a forlorn and benighted
look, and was likely to require
assistance I thought.</p>

<p>To my surprise Mrs. Blanton exclaimed,
"What delicious soup!" and Dashwood,
charming man, responded "Capital!"</p>

<p>The Virginia housewife, if so notable
and estimable a personage should deign
to read these pages, can appreciate my
feelings on this occasion. She, and only

<!-- page 86 col 2 -->

she, can know the instant relief felt by
poor mamma, and the light bound which
my heavy heart gave, as these delightful
guests made the above remarks. I could
have hugged Mrs. Blanton, and squeezed
Dashwood, so grateful was I for their
tribute to my culinary qualifications.
Mamma gave me a bright glance, and
verily I had my reward.</p>

<p>While we were discussing this royal
purple, and most delicious soup, and papa
and Mr. Blanton were talking of tobacco,
Mr. Farren, our bachelor neighbor, was
announced. Miss Blanton bridled up,
and grew very red at the mention of his
name, and Dashwood looked at Louise.
The servant came in to say that Mr.
Farren had dined. "What an amazingly
industrious man he is," said Dashwood.
"He rises by day," said Robert, "goes
fox-hunting to earn an appetite for his
breakfast; breakfasts on cream, boiled
eggs, and cold bread; walks over his
plantation until twelve; dines precisely
at three, after which he visits the ladies,
and amuses himself." "You have not
mentioned half," said papa; "I am an old-fashioned
man, and have lived full fifty
years, and I have seen, in my half century,
enough to know that these are the
men who control the destinies of nations.
These early-risers, hard-workers, strong-minded,
independent country gentlemen,
are not bound by any clique."</p>

<p>"Confined by no pent-up Utica," remarked
Miss Blanton.</p>

<p>"Exactly," said papa, with a bow;
"they are the bone and sinew of the
country; they put their shoulders to the
wheel, these sturdy, educated, wealthy
country gentlemen, and are, in fact, the
great propellers of the ship of state."</p>

<p>My brother looked at the servant,
who changed the plates.</p>

<p>"Tom Farren can do more in one day,"
said papa, now fairly launched, and forgetting
to help to fish, "than any young
man of my acquaintance. I say <i>young</i>
man, because old men work more nowadays
than young ones."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Blanton will trouble papa," said
Robert.</p>

<p>"I beg a thousand pardons, madam,"
said papa, helping neatly to fish. "May
I give you fish, Miss Blanton? Mr. Dashwood,
pray allow me, my dear sir, take a
bit of the head&mdash;ahem&mdash;and by this
great bodily exercise my young friend,
Thomas Farren, stimulates his mind, and
builds up, if I may so express myself, the
mental and physical fabric together."</p>

<p>"He makes enormous crops, I understand,"
remarked my neighbor, Mr. Blanton.</p>

<p>"And invariably gets the highest prices.

<!-- page 87 col 1 -->

He has, I suppose, on his plantations, upwards
of three hundred slaves, who are
most kindly and most admirably managed.
He will be sent to Congress, sir;
he <i>must</i> be sent to Congress, sir; we
want working men in our Legislative bodies,
sir; he is the kind of man we need
in our high places, sir," said papa, regardless
of etiquette, ladies, and Farren's position
as a suitor of our sister's, and all Robert's
interruptions.</p>

<p>"I should like to see him," said Therese,
"he is quite a catch, is he not, Louise?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, indeed," replied Louise,
blushing; "he is very handsome, and
very fascinating."</p>

<p>"Fascinating?" inquired Robert and
Dashwood in a breath.</p>

<p>"Yes, I should say so," said Louise, "he
is somewhat reserved, but I understand
he is uncommonly fascinating, and can
please any body when he chooses."</p>

<p>"When he <i>chooses</i>. Oh, perhaps so&mdash;he
never chose to fascinate <i>me</i>, Miss Louise,"
said Dashwood, in an under tone, to
my fair sister.</p>

<p>"Nor me, I declare, but,"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wonder if he will choose to fascinate
me?" asked Therese, pouting beautifully.
"I wish somebody would take the trouble
to fascinate me, really."</p>

<p>This provoking little speech being taken
by Robert altogether to himself, he began
to be very mysterious indeed, and to ask
Mrs. Blanton if she had ever seen a snake
charming a bird. If so, she must have
observed how still, and drooping, and powerless
the poor bird was under the snake's
all-charming eye. And she could easily
imagine how delighted the poor bird would
be, had he only the power to charm his
charmer back again. Whereupon, Mr.
Blanton dropped his fork, and savagely remarked
that he had yet to learn how his
sister-in-law could possibly resemble a
snake in any particular.</p>

<p>"Brother, you have not tasted your
wine!" returned Therese, laughing very
much, and trying her best to reach her
brother's foot, under the table. Thinking
she had succeeded, this dear little woman
bore down upon my unoffending toes with
great strength. At the proper moment,
mamma obeyed a look from Robert, and
rose to leave the table. Mr. Rushton,
junior, pressed the widow's hand, and saw
her to the door.</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="small">ROMANCE AND NONSENSE, WHICH, IN OLD VIRGINIA,
ARE SYNONYMES.</p>

</div>

<p>WE returned to the drawing-room, and,
of course, were agreeably surprised to find

<!-- page 87 col 2 -->

Mrs. Barbara and Mr. Farren sitting together,
the old lady regaling her favored
guest with some racy old anecdotes, which
she always reserved for great occasions.
After a highly interesting introduction of
all parties, Miss Blanton selected an isolated
seat, and by an adroit man&oelig;uvre,
forced Mr. Farren to attach himself to
her. This interesting couple sat at arm's
length, Miss Willy "laying herself out"
to secure Mr. Farren by every art she possessed,
and Mr. Farren literally shocked
at the bare idea of her attempting such a
thing. Grandma's keen eyes, lifted above
her spectacles, were circling around the
room. She noticed the widow's bare
shoulders, and exceedingly low corsage,
which was only partially concealed by her
cloud-like vapory scarf. She noticed the
scarcely perceptible sleeve, and perfect
dimpled arm, and asked me, in a whisper,
if she was going to a party? "In <i>my</i>
days," said grandma earnestly to me, "a
girl would disgrace her family by dressing
out in that way!"</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"Yes; and that yellow thing, talking
to Thomas Farren, would be confined to a
mad-house."</p>

<p>"What fine days those were!"</p>

<p>"People had to behave themselves, and
dress properly in those days, I tell you.
And pray, what is that?" abruptly inquired Mrs.
Barbara, as Alphonse entered.</p>

<p>"Master Alphonse," I answered.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, that's a figure to
bring into a gentleman's drawing-room! a
varstly fine figure. I should say, that unruly
lad had broken away from his nurse
only harf drest. I should be constrained
to surmise, in all charity, that his jacket
had yet to be put on. Bless my soul,
what are widows and the rest of mankind
coming to!"</p>

<p>The gentlemen now entered, and poor
Farren brightened up at the prospect of a
release from Miss Blanton. But Mr.
Thomas Farren was evidently sold to the
lady with the emerald-eyed serpents. In
vain he looked around upon those he had
deemed his friends, nobody came to the
rescue. They sat apart, cruelly partitioned
off from every living creature, and
conversation was getting low. Mr. Farren
began to learn to his dismay, that he
was "touching bottom." He had discussed
the last new novel, the watering places,
and the spring hats. He had admired
the baubles on her chatelaine, and done
every thing that mortal man, of iron nerve,
could do under the circumstances, and
Miss Willianna still hung on.</p>

<p>"Poor Tom Farren!" said Dashwood to
Louise.</p>

<!-- page 88 col 1 -->

<p>"Why poor Tom Farren?" asked Louise,
shrugging her white shoulders.</p>

<p>"Because he is getting to be so desperate.
His glances this way are soul-harrowing.
I declare Bob ought to go to his
relief, and allow unhappy Blanton a word
with his sister-in-law. I would take Miss
Willianna myself, but&mdash;I am so fastidious
in these matters you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know."</p>

<p>"So painfully fastidious, that an hour's
conversation with that interesting creature
in pink, would unfit me for the remainder
of my visit, nay, perhaps for life, for any
rational pleasure under the sun."</p>

<p>Fate had grouped the company in one
drawing-room. She had given Farren over
to Willianna, and Dashwood to Louise.
She had perched me, diabolically, vis-&agrave;-vis
to speechless Mr. Blanton, across a table
of bijouterie&mdash;and she had ensconced the
favored Robert snugly in an alcove with
Therese. It was painfully evident to me
that my vis-&agrave;-vis had only eyes and ears
for his brother's fascinating relict. I had
seen her trying to mollify him, by hanging
about him in her half childish affectionate
way; calling him brother&mdash;ever brother,
and looking up to him, starch-necked and
stern as he was, as her brother, her only
brother. She had a way of trying to soften
him by taking his hand familiarly into
her little velvet palm; and stretching his
long fingers one by one, over the length
and breadth of her little hand, and
then laying her other hand gently over it,
as she talked away earnestly to him,
which lapped the monster brother-in-law
in Elysium. He adored her, he had adored
her for years, and she was kind, and attentive,
and soothing to him, because of
his years of suffering and untiring love.
Mrs. Blanton had a gentle woman's heart,
returning ever love for love. Nobody
could be kind to her without gaining her
whole heart. Nobody could be in trouble
without this little woman's crying as
though her very heart would break. She
was not brilliant, or witty, but so thoroughly
good. She was coquettish, fond
of dress, volatile, and childish; but this
was only from an excess of kindness, a
thorough woman's nature, and a happy
light heart. She could not bid her brother
cease to love her, and frown upon him and
turn away, and leave him in his trouble.
She thought rather to turn the current of
his love, and by all gentleness, and sincere
affection, to make him look upon her
as a sister. She knew, that while she
listened to Robert's pleasant talk, he was
looking intently upon her charming shoulder,
and dimpled elbow, which were the
only points visible from the recess, and she
would have comforted him if she could.</p>

<!-- page 88 col 2 -->

<p>A splendid scheme now entered my
head. I determined to rescue these sufferers,
Blanton and Farren! I determined
to play a waltz, and thereby change every
body's position, and make everybody happy.
I felt that it devolved upon me to
play the part of the good fairy, and thus
to thwart the diabolical arrangements of
fate. I accordingly struck up an animated
and heel-inspiring waltz, which no
lover of waltzing could ever hope, even
under the most fortuitous circumstances,
to resist. My beloved reader, I had the
supreme satisfaction of seeing Robert take
Therese in his arms and wheel away with
her. Then, Dashwood, with his consummate
grace flung his arm about Louise,
and off they went; leaving Mr. Blanton
stark and stiff, sitting bolt upright in the
middle of the room, like a shipwrecked
man for life. I need not say that this
unhappy man served also as a target for
grandma's wonder, amazement, and intense
scrutiny. Really, I had amused
Messrs. Blanton and Farren capitally!
From their countenances, I should say it
was a highly hilarious amusement, to see
a couple of faultlessly moustached, magnificently-limbed
youngsters, flying about
with their adorables in their arms.</p>

<p>"Do you waltz?" poor Farren asked
of his pink tormentor.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; with those I&mdash;&mdash;with particular
friends."</p>

<p>"Do let us take a turn."</p>

<p>She yielded, and he took her respectfully
by the tips of her elbows, and whirled
off with her. The desperate Farren
and the chary Willianna were dangerous
navigators. They seemed to steer at random.
They soon brought Robert and
Therese to a dead halt, and made Dashwood
and Louise wheel away for dear life.
They bore down upon that rock-bound
and stranded man, Blanton, and to the
lookers-on he was in imminent danger.
Finally, they cleared the circle, and caused
grandma to open her eyes, and gather up
her skirts. When they had distinguished
themselves sufficiently by their performance,
Mr. Farren released his pink partner,
and took occasion to deposit her in
a more thickly-settled part of the room,
which I regarded as the most sensible
part of the performance.</p>

<p>There was a whisper going the round
of the saloons, that Miss Blanton loved
Tom Farren, and that he could get her
for the asking, which, I dare say, was
highly probable. Her open display of
preference, her silly smirking way, made
Tom Farren perfectly miserable. He admired
shy, retiring, modest ladies, and demonstrations
unbalanced him. He was a
young man of sound judgment, much

<!-- page 89 col 1 -->

modesty and discretion, and was really
hurt by Miss Blanton's attentions. Her
great riches, and distinguished relations,
could not tempt him. She should have
bestowed them upon that handsome supercilious
fellow, Dashwood, who, of all
things, wanted money enough to take him
to Europe.</p>

<p>"Pray, who is this Mr. Dashwood?"
Miss Blanton inquired of me.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dashwood," said I, "is one of the
most talented young men I know. He is
my brother's particular friend, and likely
to distinguish himself some day."</p>

<p>"Indeed! I thought him only a dandy,
you know."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, he is anything else."</p>

<p>"Dear me, how odd these geniuses are!
One never can keep the run of them.
Sometimes they are exquisites, then again
they are slovens. They should adopt a
uniform, for there is no telling them from
other people. I slighted a lady, who, it
seems, was one of them, the other day.
She was so pert and disagreeable, and put
on airs which I really did <i>not</i> think her
appearance justified, and I cut her. We
Virginians are so particular, you know;
so I quietly gave her to understand <i>my</i>
position, and who do you think she was?
Why, Mrs. Haller, the great authoress,
who was making a tour for the express
purpose of studying Virginia, and the
Virginians. I shall be down in her next
book. I feel that I am doomed to be
slaughtered by that woman's pen.</p>

<p>"Dreadful!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Horrible! wasn't it? But pray, how
is one to know them? I would not willingly
slight them, but how <i>am</i> I to know
them?"</p>

<p>"By consummate effrontery, and unbounded
assurance," said Mr. Farren,
bitterly.</p>

<p>"Not always," said I, "sometimes they
are diffident; indeed I may say they are
always diffident, until they are spoilt by
flattery, for which other people should
have to answer."</p>

<p>"One thing I know," said Miss Blanton,
"I shall never slight a lady with a gray
shawl, large foot, mashed bonnet, and
long nose again. I shall know <i>she</i> is a
genius. Do you write poetry, Miss?"
she said, turning to me.</p>

<p>I quickly said "No."</p>

<p>"Yes, you do, now&mdash;indeed you do.
Will you write me an acrostic? do oblige
me, will you?"</p>

<p>"You must call on Mr. Dashwood,"
said I.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dashwood, Mr. Dashwood!"
cried the pink female, trying to be childish,
like Therese, "will you write me a
piece of poetry?"</p>

<!-- page 89 col 2 -->

<p>"I, madam! I am thunderstruck; upon
my word I am thunderstruck at your request,"
cried Dashwood, running his fingers
through his hair, and putting on a
favorite porcupine look of his; "but I
will confidently assert, and stoutly maintain,
that if I am ever to write poetry, if
there be a spark of poetry in me, such a
request would instantly cause spontaneous
combustion."</p>

<p>At this little Mrs. Blanton was seized
with an uncontrollable fit of laughter, for
which nobody could reasonably account.</p>

<p>"But they tell me you are a poet,"
urged the lady, drawing a chair near him.</p>

<p>"Long, long ago," commenced Dashwood,
with a low intense voice, and a
glittering vibratory eye, "when first my
heart shook off its swaddling clothes, I
was foolish enough to dream I was a poet.
I looked around me upon the heavens
and the earth, and lo! the old familiar
hills shone with a newer fire, and the
sun's track deepened and gleamed, and
the arrowy beams vibrated intensely, and
there was a fervor and a glow come over
creation; and still I dreamed&mdash;oh, foolish
dream!&mdash;that I was a poet!"</p>

<p>"Did you?" ejaculated the lady in
pink.</p>

<p>"I dreamed," continued Dashwood, his
face lighting up, "that I saw with no
common eye, and that I felt with a deeper
and a stronger power I was not all
clay, nor like this one, and that one, whose
eye had none of the soul-light of mine.
Oh, this blessed, intense, quivering, blissful
dream! Sweeping o'er the waking
heart-strings, and bringing music from
the vasty deep; and there was music,
gushing, swelling chords, and aerial bounding
notes, floating o'er this blessed, mournful
dream! Then budding thought was
bursting, and latent powers were awaking,
and hidden feelings were revealing;
and I hugged to my heart, and guarded
from the dull, unsympathizing world, my
great and wondrous gift from God. I
tramped on, and on, jostling the soulless,
and pushing on, that I might lay my gift
upon the altar. I felt neither hunger nor
thirst. The body was a fetter I despised,
detaining me from my great end. I longed
to throw it aside as unceremoniously as I
would my overcoat upon a summer's day,
Miss Blanton, and press on! Herculean
fellows, who hungered, and slept, and
ministered to their bodies like slaves,
pushed me aside. Ladies of great mental
balance and bodily strength looked at my
frantic efforts with a sneer, and passed
proudly on, heralded by Fame. Poets,
with eyes glowing with fire,&mdash;my own
fire, I knew it at a glance,&mdash;followed in
their wake. Fame was up at auction,

<!-- page 90 col 1 -->

they said, and they crowded on. Still
dreaming, I went on, toiling after I knew
not what, hoping for more than this poor
world can give. Dreaming, yet dreaming,
still on I went, and this fierce race ended
in the maddest brain fever that ever poet
had. I awoke from this ecstatic trance,
to find myself nearly scalped by the Doctors,
from which judicious treatment you
will perceive that my poetic locks have
not yet entirely recovered. I was food
for leeches, and the peculiar delight of
scarificators, for more than three weeks.
Whether the leeches went off with my
exuberant poetry, or it was taken off with
my scalp, I am not prepared to say."</p>

<p>"What a blessing, young man," said
grandma, handing around her snuff-box,
"that the doctors interfered before you
made a ninny of yourself. You may regard
it as a special providence, that attack."</p>

<p>"Poesy, my dear madam," said Dashwood,
with a profound bow to grandma,
"is defined by physicians to be a chronic
congestion, or extravasation of the brain,
occurring in persons of highly nervous and
sanguinous temperament."</p>

<p>"To be relieved by partial beheading,"
said Robert, laughing.</p>

<p>"To be allayed by leeching, and anti-phlogistics.
Cases of long standing belong
to the mad-house, the faculty think,"
said Dashwood.</p>

<p>"But you write acrostics occasionally,
do you not?" asked Miss Blanton.</p>

<p>"It was an acrostic to this lady," said
Dashwood, turning to Louise, "which
brought about those terrible results I
have been telling you of. My physician
advises me to beware of acrostics. He
considers them the most inflammatory
and dangerous species of poetry."</p>

<p>Poor Robert laughed until he was
ashamed of himself, at Dashwood's earnest
countenance and unshrinking gravity.
Miss Blanton had to give up all
hopes of an acrostic, so she turned upon
grandma, and began to question her.
The reader can easily imagine that Miss
Blanton immediately found herself in clover,
as the saying is. She had only to
ask the most trivial questions to set Mrs.
Barbara's tongue in motion. She had
only to suggest an idea, or gently to jog
her memory, in order to provoke a perfect
avalanche of anecdote. Miss Blanton had
now aroused the right passenger. Mrs.
Barbara straightened up, and proceeded
to draw from the great storehouse of her
memory, treasure after treasure. She reverted
to one of her favorite topics, the
burning of the Chatterton Theatre.</p>

<p>"If it hadn't been for <i>that</i> fire," said
Mrs. Barbara, in a mysterious and impressive

<!-- page 90 col 2 -->

tone, "I should never have been
a Rushton! I think it highly probable
I should have been a Maddon!"</p>

<p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Miss Blanton,
thrillingly interested, "was Maddon
burned?"</p>

<p>"No, but you shall hear it all, and then
blame me if you can. You see, I was engaged
to Maddon, and had discarded Rushton.
On this eventful and destiny-destroying
night," commenced grandma
forcibly, "the management presented to
the lovers of the drama a most attractive
and enticing bill. We all determined to
go to the play. My hair was splendid in
those days, and at least two hands longer
than Louise's. I had it arranged in the
morning by a hair-dresser, who thought
proper to saturate it with a kind of oil,
which, to my horror, I afterwards learned
was highly combustible. Maddon came
to our house rather early, with tickets,
and spoke rapturously of Mrs. Somebody&mdash;I
forget her name,&mdash;who, he said, was
going to electrify all Chatterton by her
performance that night. We were sitting
in our box, patiently awaiting the rising
of the curtain, after the second or third
act, when a whiff of smoke came from the
stage, accompanied by a slight, crackling
sound. I thought they were making their
thunder and lightning you know, and was
perfectly easy. Not so Maddon. He stood
up, his eyes flashing, his nostrils dilating,
and his lips compressed. Presently 'fire!
fire!' was heard, and Maddon dashed over
the railing upon the heads of the pit,
stepped over the orchestra, and into the
foot-lights upon the stage, leaving me unceremoniously
to take care of myself,
wondering what on the face of the earth
was to pay. I hadn't sense enough to
move hand or foot. The crowd writhed,
and swore, and elbowed, and fainted, and
trampled on each other, while I, absolutely
petrified, remained glued to my seat. I
could not budge an inch. People mashed
me, and tore me all to pieces, and tall men
stepped over my head, without so much
as 'by your leave, Miss.' Finding that
every body was making for the doors, I
bethought me of looking out for a window.
As soon as I began to move I found myself
in a current of human beings, while
crash after crash, and scream after scream
was heard. I was pushed on by the
crowd, until I stood before a window, and
I hung on to my place. I heard somebody
crying out to me from below. It was
Rushton, calling on me to spring from the
window. He placed a feather-bed upon the
pavement, and, calling frantically to me,
implored me to jump out. But I was
paralyzed by fright. People were pushing
me away, and jumping out like shot out

<!-- page 91 col 1 -->

of a shovel. In the crowd below I recognized
the deserter Maddon, with the actress
in his arms, who had fainted in the
street. Again Rushton screamed to me,
and begged me to spring out upon the bed.
I hadn't sense enough to move. Presently
a flame licked me upon the back of my
head, which, as I told you, was all saturated
with a highly inflammable oil,&mdash;and
I assure you, Miss Blanton, I sprang out
with such superhuman strength, that I
cleared the feather bed, passed over Rushton,
and descended upon a large lot of
household and kitchen furniture, belonging
to Pratt &amp; Brothers, next door above.
People were astonished at me, and all
eyes were turned upon me, as I reclined
comfortably upon the household and
kitchen furniture. I understand it was
the greatest jump made that night. The
tight-rope dancers didn't come near me.
Suffice it to say," concluded Mrs. Barbara,
with great gravity and importance, "that
Mr. Rushton's gallantry, as contrasted
with Maddon's shameful desertion, and
devotion to the actress, caused me to become
a Rushton!"</p>

<p>Grandma's maidenly choice was universally
applauded. Every body thought
she was right in discarding Maddon, and
consenting to adorn, and illuminate, the
Rushton family.</p>

<p>But about Robert's eccentric friend
Dashwood. This handsome fellow was a
perfect riddle to ordinary people. He
had a way of flashing out sometimes, in a
dazzling electrifying manner, and then
subsiding into a man of less than ordinary
pretensions. Sometimes people would
begin to think him most extraordinary,
destined for great things, capable of wonders,
and suddenly he would put all such
charitable notions to flight, by some unaccountable
freak, which would have the
happy effect of precipitating public
opinion below zero. Robert alone, and
perhaps Louise, held the key to his absurd
whimsicalities. To Robert he was
the most glorious and piquant of men.
To Louise,&mdash;ah, what was he to Louise?
More than mortal, more than lover, more
than beloved. That he was pervaded by
a poetic something, nobody could doubt.
That he was lifted above his fellows, was
beyond a question. That he had rare
powers, glorious-powers, every lady of any
refinement and cultivation, of his acquaintance,
was ready to admit. But, in the
ordinary business of life&mdash;in buying and
selling&mdash;making money, and the most of
one's talents, our brilliant Dashwood was
hopelessly inferior. He could assume, at
a moment's warning, any character under
the sun. Sometimes, for whole weeks, he
was the man of business, going about

<!-- page 91 col 2 -->

with a brisk manner, closely buttoned
coat, and knit brows. During these
business attacks, he would shoot ahead
of the old stagers, throw a flood of light
upon matters before shrouded in darkness,
give quite a new turn to the old way of
doing things, and after triumphantly
proving himself eminently worthy of the
counting-room or the desk, and blazing
away to his own satisfaction, a complete
reaction would take place.</p>

<p>The next thing you would hear of
Dashwood, he would be idling about his
lodgings, in gorgeous slippers, trailing
robe, and jewelled cap, writing poetry for
the magazines.</p>

<p>Again he would assume his profession
of the law with an ardor and impetuosity,
which could not last, make a crack speech,
astonish the court, gain his suit, pocket
his fee, and live like a lord, eschewing
every thing but love, wine, and cigars.
After this, he would take a trip off to a
watering-place, or some fashionable place
of folly, and smirk, and polk, and create
sensations, until he was tired. Of course,
after this, he would have a severe attack
of <i>dolce far niente</i>, and then the usual
return of <i>otium cum dignitate</i>. He did
not care a fig for money, because he could
generally contrive to make a little when
hard pressed. He was not called a dissipated
man, or a man of bad habits, but
people called him an uncommon man, an
astonishing man, a psychological riddle, a
jack at all trades and good at none. His
varied talents, his brilliancy, his powers,
ever obedient, and ready to rise equal to
any emergency, his eloquence, his intuitive
knowledge of almost everything, his splendid
person, and flexibility of manner,
gave him a position among men, from which
no freak on his part could displace him.
To confess the truth, people petted his
whims, in order to secure the use of his
talents. Generally, if a fellow-citizen had
a very unpromising case on hand, which
he knew could only be gained by a master
spirit, or some legerdemain peculiar to
lawyers, or some trick of oratory, he consulted
Dashwood, who, if in the want of
money at that particular time, or exactly
in the vein, would take hold of the matter,
turn the whole strength of his soul
and body upon it, and make such an effort
for his client as few men, even in Virginia,
could make.</p>

<p>To love such a man as this, was to tie
one's self to a wheel at once. To love
Dashwood was perfect folly. But there
are some women, doubtless, provided by
Providence for such men, who exult in
martyrdom; who, of all things, love to
make living sacrifices of themselves;
whose hearts are moved by wonders, and

<!-- page 92 col 1 -->

astonishment, and who must have a demi-god,
for nothing short of a demi-god can
till up their capabilities of loving. The glitter
and the glare of great personal beauty,
astonishing powers, and irresistible manners,
envelope them, and they are lost.</p>

<p>Louise, woman-like, first loved him, and
then began to search about for reasons to
sustain her. She loved him, first, because
she could not help it, and because amid
all his fickleness he was true to her. He
was as steady in love, as he was unstable
in every thing else. True, my sister was
enough to fill a poet's eye, yet it must have
been flattering to her, to see this man anchored,
you may say, at her feet. He
never swerved from her, or pretended to
love another, or deigned to think there
was any thing loveable in any other woman
under the sun. Let him be politician,
lawyer, poet, or dandy, his love for
her remained the same. This was his
great redeeming grace. What young lady
of eighteen could withstand poetry, law,
oratory, grace, fashion, great personal
beauty, and most of all, constancy, combined?
What southern beauty, spoilt by
over-indulgence, never knowing the want
of money or of friends, kept in seclusion,
and guarded from all the ills that flesh is
heir to, would not have loved this flashing
Dashwood?</p>

<p>There are many, older and more experienced
than our beautiful sister, who would
have yielded to his power.</p>

<p>Tom Farren&mdash;upright, economical, well-balanced,
systematic, money-making, plantation-managing
Tom Farren, detested
our poor Dashwood. He would be ready
to say "fudge" at the bare mention of his
name. He could see nothing but folly
and consummate assurance in all he said
and did. He wondered how people could
tolerate such a man, who was, in fact, no
man at all. How Robert and, most of all,
Louise, could listen to him with any
patience.</p>

<p>There had been a talk among the sovereigns
who adored and petted Dashwood,
of sending him to Congress, some day;
but the neighboring gentry and landholders
were in favor of Farren. Robert, too,
who was a mighty man among the young
girls and old maids in the neighborhood,
and patronized incipient dandies, and carried
on with old ladies and gossips at a
high rate, was heart and soul for Dashwood.
He declared Virginia hadn't given
such a son to the world since she favored
mankind with John Randolph, and always
excused every vagary of his friend, by a
dark and oracular allusion to the "eccentricities
of genius." It was a rare frolic
to Robert, this wheedling human nature,
and enticing poor gullibility, to help Dashwood

<!-- page 92 col 2 -->

up the ladder. He hadn't had any
thing so rich since the old rebellion days
at college. He flattered, and joked, and
visited among the outsiders, and was seen
gallanting some of the oddest dressed creatures
to church&mdash;solely for Dashwood's
sake, he said. He would take giggling
country lasses on his arms, and supply
the babies with gingerbread, and keep
mammas posted up in the news, solely because
some day Dashwood might need
popularity. Of course, Robert upheld
Louise in her preference for her brilliant
and meteor-like lover; and he sustained
her nobly, in trying times, when grandma
and papa would call her to account for refusing
Farren again and again. Grandma
was really awed by Tom Farren. She never
raised her eyes to him without thinking
of three hundred negroes, five plantations,
his uncle, Governor Farren, two
dwelling houses, and prospective winters
in Washington. Our dear mamma, though
still and placid, and seldom obtruding her
opinions before folks, had, nevertheless, a
strong dash of romance in her composition,
which all the Rushton practicability could
not entirely eradicate. Papa had no more
poetry in him than a vice; he had so
ridiculed all such nonsense, so preached
against novel reading, so railed against
Byron, so laughed at Dickens, and so completely
annihilated Thackeray, that mamma
had to withdraw her opinions and retire
within herself. She was forced to
read her favorite authors in her own room,
to weep over Effie Deans and Byron's
sad effusions in secret. The timid woman
took a mother's pride in seeing her own
smouldering embers of poetry and sentiment
burning defiantly and glowing intensely
in the magnanimous Robert, and
the tender Louise.</p>

<p>She nourished them with her treasured
books, she imbued them with her poetry,
she sketched for them the wonders of the
realms of thought; she read to them of
the inner life; she talked to them of cloud-land
and the yearnings of the heart; she
held up before their eyes a beautiful world
which they could make their own; she
purified them from the dross, and bade
them throw off the earthy particles with
contempt; she aroused imagination, and
beheld with delight the mighty giant rearing
its magnificent head. She thought
she was arming them for the battle of
life; she thought there were moments of
darkness and gloom for all, and that these
treasures would lighten them; she thought,
dear mother, of woman in her solitude,
embalmed within her narrow, wearying
sphere, of her long, dark, hopeless hours,
of her isolation and loneliness, of the winter
days and winter nights, after the gay

<!-- page 93 col 1 -->

summer should be o'er, and she gave her
beautiful daughters these, her hidden

<!-- page 93 col 2 -->

treasures, that they might comfort and
beguile her then.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="small">THE AUTHORESS PROVES TO BE A DAGUERREOTYPIST,
AND BEGS TO LAY BEFORE THE READER SOME
CHOICE SPECIMENS OF HER ART.</p>

</div>

<p>WE were pleased to see that our guests
enjoyed themselves. Every thing was
done that could be done to promote their
pleasure. Mrs. Blanton was delighted
with her visit, and a favorite with every
member of the family, except grandma.
In a few days, Therese was completely
domesticated. With mamma she was a
particular favorite; and the two, happy
with each other, would go off upon house-keeping
excursions, and to see the sick,
and take the longest walks, while Adolphe
would be skipping around them, forming
a group most pleasant to the eye, and
perfectly charming to Robert. My brother
would watch the evolutions of this
little fairy who had enslaved him, with
mingled expressions of pride, tenderness,
and ecstacy. She was so natural and
good-humored, so arch and coquettish, so
filled with all we are wont to love in
woman, that nobody need blame Robert
for his happiness, or Mr. Blanton for his
misery. Therese proposed to make some
cakes for us, with her own little hands.
She told the housekeeper that she knew
how to make the best cakes any body ever
tasted in the world. Of course, such a
proposition placed my brother Robert in
the seventh heaven. To think that Therese
could make cakes! Gracious, what a
thought! Real, round, plump little cakes,
light and melting in the mouth! And
that he should eat them!</p>

<p>Of course, these cakes were honored
above all the cakes that ever appeared
upon our table. Therese, funny little
woman, doing the honors, while her little
tongue ran on the while in its pleasant
social way. Miss Blanton frowned, and
asked her if those cakes hadn't soda in
them?</p>

<p>"They are seasoned with nectar, genuine
nectarine cakes, upon my word," retorted
Robert.</p>

<p>"I put a little piece of soda, sister,
just so much," said Therese, checking off
a little tip of rosy finger nail, to show how
much.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! I detected it." cried Miss
Blanton; whereupon Robert turned around
gravely, and looked at Miss Blanton,
evidently regarding that lady as a complex
chemical apparatus from that moment.

<!-- page 139 col 2 -->

Dashwood cried out from his seat for a
few more of the nectarine cakes, and papa
reached forth demurely, and apologized
for taking "Captain Manners," which was
the last of them. Little Therese was so
delighted with her performance. Her
oval eyes were glistening, and her soft
cheek glowing; really, all this was most
charming. Robert became so magnanimous,
after eating of these cakes, that he
allowed Mr. Blanton a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with
Therese in the grotto.</p>

<p>Dashwood was the life of our party.
He planned fishing excursions and riding
parties. He played at graces with Miss
Blanton, and at backgammon with Mr.
Blanton. He read for our amusement in
the early hours, and repeated poetry in
sylvan haunts, at times when all hearts
were filled with poetry. He sang bass
with all the ladies, and got up serenades
in the <i>wee</i> small hours. He aided and
comforted mamma during the weighty
ceremonies of dinner, and was never too
late for breakfast. He sat in tableaux
with rigid propriety, and in a rash moment
undertook a waltz with the dangerous
Willianna. He captivated every heart but
papa's&mdash;and even papa was charmed with
him as a guest, only begging to be excused
when he was proposed as a son-in-law.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blanton was in transports about
Dashwood. What a man he was! Never
had she seen such an intellectual face,
faultless contour, and superb address&mdash;except&mdash;except&mdash;and
here Therese broke
down, and looked sideways at Robert,
and blushed.</p>

<p>"She alludes to the departed Blanton,"
whispered grandma in confidence to me&mdash;tapping
her snuff-box, getting her pocket
handkerchief ready, and sighing with great
force.</p>

<p>"Very likely," said I, pretending not
to notice Robert's eye catching the light
of hers, and the half whispered "charming
Therese," which followed.</p>

<p>I have already said that Robert was
so overcome by generosity and magnanimity,
after partaking of Mrs. Blanton's
cakes, that he went off to the river with
Alphonse, and allowed Mr. Blanton a
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with his adorable, in his own
consecrated grotto. It seems that Mr.
Blanton was consumed by jealousy, and
that he really became restive and unruly,
and that Therese almost broke her heart
in this grotto, begging her brother to give

<!-- page 140 col 1 -->

her up like a man, and let her love Mr.
Rushton. I learned it was a terrific scene.
The tender woman fearing to wound, and
yet obliged to cut him to the very heart.
She throwing herself upon his mercy, and
he mad with love. "And has it come to
this?" said Mr. Blanton, sternly, to his
sister. "Am <i>I</i> to be trifled with in this
way? Is my love of five years to be
measured with the mushroom passion of
this flippant stripling? Have you no
gratitude&mdash;no common sense&mdash;nothing,
absolutely nothing, but dimples, and tears,
and nonsense?"</p>

<p>"Dearest brother," begun Therese&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am not your brother, madam."</p>

<p>"Dear Henry, I only tell you how I
love Robert." said Therese, naively.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!"</p>

<p>"And implore your forgiveness."</p>

<p>"My forgiveness; pray, madam, what
have I to forgive?"</p>

<p>"Me&mdash;your little Therese&mdash;your sister."</p>

<p>"My little pest and torment," he said,
toying with her pretty fingers. She
laughed and drew nearer to him, in her
winning artless way, and he folded her in
his arms, not exactly like a brother, I
fear.</p>

<p>"My own dear good brother," murmured
Therese. He suffered her to call
him so. She might have called him fiend,
and he would have held her to his breast,
with her soft wreathing arms and pearly
cheek.</p>

<p>Poor Blanton! To find himself so
proud, stiff, and unyielding; being turned
around a little woman's finger, in spite of
his teeth. And to be dying and sighing
at his age, for a pair of wreathing arms
and pearly cheeks.</p>

<p>We were all very sad when our gay
guests took their departure. Robert
watched the carriages until they turned
down the hill, and were out of sight; and
then he came into the back parlor, and
declared that Mrs. Blanton was the sweetest
woman in the world. Grandma immediately
remarked that her dresses were
too low, for which illusion scarfs could
offer no apology at all; and gave it as her
deliberate opinion, that she had better
marry Mr. Blanton, or he would petrify;
indeed, she considered that stiff specimen
as already far advanced into petrifaction.</p>

<p>Dashwood said she had about as much
soul as a mermaid. And that the whole
secret of her success with Bob could be distinctly
traced to three dimples (they being,
he was sorry to say, very weak points with
Bob), a well turned bust, two rows of
teeth, several smiles, and a pair of baby
feet&mdash;not to mention a way she had of
looking up at a man, and down at a man,

<!-- page 140 col 2 -->

and aside at a man&mdash;and thereby putting
a man to great bewilderment and confusion.</p>

<p>"Pray, what do you call soul? She
has delicacy, refinement, quickness of apprehension,
relish for wit; she is never
ruffled; she is always tender and gentle;
she is careful of every body's feelings, and
good to the poor. Now if that isn't soul,
old fellow," cried Robert, slapping him on
the shoulder, "tell me what it is?"</p>

<p>"Art," said Dashwood.</p>

<p>"Art! By heaven, she is as unsophisticated
as a child! Her own son is not
more guileless."</p>

<p>"By the way, that little son, how will
you dispose of him in the matrimonial
contract?" asked Dashwood.</p>

<p>"Why," said Robert, "I will take
that little boy by the hand, and show him
the way to go. I will tell him where to
look for breakers, and where he may expect
treachery beneath the dimpling waves&mdash;and,
perhaps&mdash;perhaps," said Robert
laughing, "I will point to one eccentric
Dashwood; and bid him look and take
warning."</p>

<p>"No, you will not!" cried Dashwood,
with a bright face; "no, you will not,
sir! But you may be able to say by that
time, 'See Dashwood, how <i>he</i> has struggled,
and how <i>he</i> has conquered, and what
a brave figure <i>he</i> cuts upon his pedestal!'
You may say, 'Go and do likewise,' to
your little son&mdash;who knows?"</p>

<p>I saw Louise look up, and smile gloriously
upon him. I saw mamma turn
with a proud bright look towards him,
and I saw Robert reach forward and grasp
his hand, and hold it, that he might read
his sparkling, glowing countenance.</p>

<p>Surely Dashwood, if aught under the
sun can fix thee in thy purpose, it is this.
If aught can settle the rover in thee, it is
this. Unstable as water, restless as the
wind, unsatisfied as the sea, brilliant as
the sun, magnanimous as Jove; if aught
can gather thy great powers into one purpose,
surely it is this!</p>

<p>"I intend," said Dashwood, "to shake
off the sin which doth so easily beset me,
and turn over a new leaf. You see, I have
been all this time running my fingers over
the keys."</p>

<p>"And uncertain music making," said
Robert.</p>

<p>"Merely to find the tune; and I intend
to find the tune."</p>

<p>"God grant it," said my brother.</p>

<p>"I intend to run up and down the
gamut, until I find out the tune of my
life," remarked Dashwood.</p>

<p>"It is to be a brilliant introduction to
an overture, I suspect," said Robert.</p>

<p>"Or a romance <i>&agrave; la Reeve</i>," said I.</p>

<!-- page 141 col 1 -->

<p>"Or a fantasia," said Louise.</p>

<p>"I do not know yet; but I suspect,
I strongly suspect, that I am now upon
the verge of a discovery. I think after
having rambled on, and trying this key
and that, I am now about to find out in
what key I can best perform."</p>

<p>"You have been scampering about
among sharps, flats, and naturals," said
Robert jocosely.</p>

<p>"Indeed have I."</p>

<p>"And dreamily running the scales,
and trying your chords, as young ladies
are wont to do, before entering into the
body of an astonishing piece."</p>

<p>"Exactly. I expect to launch out into
brilliant execution, now, the first opportunity,"
said Dashwood, shaking off all
gravity, and treating this subject, as he
did all others, with intrepid recklessness.
The glorious tinting on Louise's cheek
faded, and Dashwood's momentary enthusiasm
was gone. He and Robert lived
for jokes and fun. They had no more
idea of the great ends of life than a couple
of butterflies. They were a well-matched
pair. Loving each other first, and then
loving their respective sweethearts. But
these young fellows were only twenty and
twenty-two.</p>

<p>Dashwood, who was the elder, was an
orphan, allowed by his guardian to grow
up and run wild, under the supervision of
dame Nature, to whom he was more indebted
than to family or friends. Consequently,
nobody could expect much from
him, until twenty-five or thereabouts.
Robert was too rich, I believe, to follow a
profession. He had a plantation, which
his overseer managed, while he sported
upon the proceeds. He had studied law
somewhere, and had a law library, but he
considered it entirely too dry for a gentleman
of his tastes. Dashwood was pushed
up the hill by poverty, which ranks high
among stimuli and propellers, and generally
accomplishes something for young
men. Robert having no such enemy, or
rather friend in the rear, lingered in pleasant
places, and sported in luxuriant vales,
and turned from the great hill of life with
contempt.</p>

<p>After the departure of our pleasant
guests, Louise was sent by our wary papa
into Siberian banishment. In other words,
she was sent under the care of two maid
servants, and papa's own man Jerry, to
Mrs. Ph&oelig;be Braxley, to be kept out of
sight and hearing of Dashwood. Papa
was very much in hopes that something
of a Providential nature would occur to
get Dashwood out of our neighborhood,
so that diffident young Farren might have
a fair field for the contemplated matrimonial
adjustment between these two staunch

<!-- page 141 col 2 -->

Whig and moneyed families. Louise was,
therefore, sent beyond the orbit of this
brilliant comet, before whom all other
luminaries paled, to Mrs. Braxley, before
whom no luminary of any intelligence
dare show itself. Mrs. Braxley, like all
the immediate descendants of Mrs. Barbara
(whose vein of eccentricity, by the
mere accident of a theatrical conflagration,
had been turned into our family), was a
character.</p>

<p>Mrs. Phoebe Jane Braxley was a woman
out of a hundred. She was a shrewd,
managing, business woman; viewing all
nature with a keen eye, and carrying every
thing before her. She was blunt and
plain spoken; telling people flatly, and
without circumlocution, what she thought:
full of spunk; indeed people have been
heard to remark, that she was "spunk to
the back bone."</p>

<p>She was the greatest domestic manager
in the whole country, and celebrated,
far and near, for the neatness of her household,
and the regularity and economy of
her establishment. Mamma, who was a
weak woman in this respect, regarded
Mrs. Braxley with profound awe, and consulted
her in her management, as she
would consult a highly gifted oracle.
She kept whole rows of sleek, tidy
negro girls at work, under her vigilant
eye. She had also half-a-dozen negro
lads, about twelve years old or thereabouts,
whose uniform was a blue jacket
and white trowsers, and who could be seen
on fine days going through their evolutions
in the yard and garden, like a well-drilled
company. She had, as privy council,
several staid, prim, high-capped, low-curtsying
old negro women, who, report said,
knew every thing. They wove and dyed
the most enormous quantities of homespun;
striped and checked carpets of bright
colors, and beautifully shaded; blankets
of rose patterns, and curious workmanship;
counterpanes, knotted, dotted, crossbarred,
raised, flowered, and bordered.
These learned high-capped women (the
pride and stay of all well-regulated Virginia
homes, and very tyrants in their
sphere), could be seen early of mornings,
hanging out long chains of blue cotton
warp upon the palings; festooning whole
pieces of cloth out to dry; spreading out
long white strips on the dewy grass, to
bleach; making starch; peeling apples;
mustering, like Macbeth's witches, around
tremendous cauldrons; and going about
at all times with rigid faces and important
looks, as though the destinies of all mankind
were in their hands. Mrs. Braxley
herself was frequently with these old
women, consulting over bits of board,
wrapped with bright colors, or what they

<!-- page 142 col 1 -->

called drafts, or abstruse and many cornered
patterns. Mrs. Braxley, who had
as much energy as Bonaparte, always
made large tobacco crops, engaged her
own overseer, and turned him off midway
between January and Christmas, if he did
not walk exactly to suit her; grew her
own corn and wheat; raised her own pork,
beeves, and fowls; and was always in
advance of her neighbors, in green peas
and fried chicken. She was a tall, fine
woman of forty; standing erect and independent,
with a sun-burnt face and clear
gray eye; speaking quickly, and to the
point; dressing neatly and compactly, not
even bending to that female tyrant, fashion,
but choosing, year after year, after a
pattern of her own invention. Her sleeves
were large enough to roll up over the elbows;
her skirts short enough not to
sweep the yard, or to interfere with Mrs.
Braxley in going up any flight of steps,
however formidable. Her caps were made
with an eye to a weekly washing; her
shoes ample and double-soled. Mrs.
Braxley often boasted that fashion came
to her once in seven years, and that she
never had a corn; and, though her family
was a gouty family, and she might add a
corny family, yet she defied both. This
lady, as the reader already perceives, was
a worthy daughter of Mrs. Barbara, though
she had none of Mrs. Barbara's weaknesses,
viz., love of family, style, big names,
fortunes, and Paris fashions. Mrs. Braxley
despised pretension and display, and
entertained a sovereign contempt, to use
her own expression, for the "fag end of a
big family." But one defect had this
model female; I cannot call it a weakness,
for Mrs. Braxley had no weaknesses. One
defect had she, which I cannot conscientiously
pass over in silence. My beloved
reader, will you believe it?&mdash;this neat,
orderly, sin-exterminating woman, rubbed
snuff! She kept a snuff-box in her right
pocket, filled with the strongest and most
pungent Scotch snuff; and she went about
all day, brandishing a dangerous-looking
hickory stick, with a mop end, which she
was constantly dipping into this huge
black horn snuff-box, and loading with
snuff, which I am sorry to say was duly
deposited in Mrs. Braxley's mouth. This
horrible practice, called in lower Virginia
and North Carolina, dipping, is of respectable
standing. I have known many dippers
in my life, who, like my aunt Braxley,
had but that one fault; and I must
halt just here, in my description of my
aunt, to pay my respects to "dipping."
Ladies who confess to "taking a dip," are,
I am sorry to say, exceedingly ferocious
on the subject. They repel indignantly
any attack upon this favorite and genial

<!-- page 142 col 2 -->

pursuit. Beautiful creatures, with rosy,
perfumed mouths, will grow restless at
"dipping time," and will cautiously desert
lover, husband, father, or friend, at the
established dipping hour; to draw out, in
some snug retreat, these formidable and
nauseous-looking hickory sticks, with mop
ends, and fill their delicate mouths with
load after load, of horrid Scotch snuff!
That estimable lady, who, after kissing
her own cow, turned around and proclaimed
to astonished mankind, "<i>de gustibus
non est disputandum</i>," surely had the
gift of second sight, and must have had her
prophetic eye upon troops of dippers,
away down in the vista of time, gliding
off with nimble step to this remarkable
pursuit.</p>

<p>Forgive me, dippers, if I have played
the <i>spy</i> in your midst. Forgive me if I
have approached your <i>sancta</i> with a potent
hickory wand, and been injudiciously
admitted. Forgive me for having, with
grave visage, followed your example, and
walloped my mop-stick deep in your black
horn boxes, that I might get the "hang"
of this delightful recreation. Forgive me
for saying, that I have seen you giving
each other the wink at dipping-time, and
stealing off one by one, with innocent
faces and compressed smiles, to range
yourselves <i>&agrave; les regles</i> in compact circles,
around brisk winter fires, or in back summer
piazzas, and then luxuriously dipping&mdash;dipping&mdash;dipping.</p>

<p>By simply arming herself with a
hickory stick, and boldly penetrating the
charmed circle of these dippers, the curious
reader can see human nature in a new
light. She (for no gentleman is ever admitted,
under any circumstances) will hear
ladies inviting ladies to "come over and
take a dip." She will see them grouped together,
with handkerchiefs spread over their
laps, snuff-boxes open, and mops at work,
dipping, the sly happy creatures! at the
maddest rate. Unfortunately, my curious
reader will find that they do not confine
their dippings to their black horn boxes;
they sometimes dip into their friends!
The stimulative weed excites these ladies,
and they unbosom themselves, spin the
longest yarns, open the darkest pages, and
dip&mdash;and dip&mdash;and dip.</p>

<p>"Dippers" are of gregarious habits,
going in herds, communicating by signs,
and bound together in long unbroken
chains. They will face any danger to
meet an appointment, and would go
through a brush fire to rub their teeth,
and wag their heads and chat. Woe be to
the absent dipper in such dangerous times.
Woe be to her if the community cannot
furnish a murder, or a run-away match,
or a jealous husband, or a monster of

<!-- page 143 col 1 -->

some kind, for the entertainment&mdash;these
dippers will most assuredly dip into her!</p>

<p>Sometimes we find a small band of
dippers cast into a highly dangerous and
anti-dipping community. Public opinion
is against dipping; husbands and fathers
are against dipping; young men are against
dipping. Under these unfavorable circumstances
they unite into secret societies,
concealing their boxes and mops, abusing
the weed publicly and vehemently, resorting
to private signs, appointing rendezvous,
meeting, mid hairbreadth escapes and
thrilling adventures&mdash;and then, oh! such
royal dips! Dipping into every thing.
Dipping into the so-and-so's, and the
everybody's, with a vengeance! Dipping
into families and friends, probing the sorest
wounds with these mopped sticks; brandishing
their weapons more and more
fiercely, until, from the stimulating effects
of the weed, they turn against their own
husbands, and relate such matrimonial
trials as would still every mop for reflection!</p>

<p>Mrs. Braxley was a leading dipper;
an independent go-ahead dipper; from
whom many timid dippers plucked a little
courage.</p>

<p>Mrs. Braxley would brandish her
tooth-brush in the President's face, if
provoked to it; and a brave commander-in-chief
was she.</p>

<p>Poor Louise would have been very
comfortably located, had it not been for
uncle Joe, the meek husband of the above-mentioned.</p>

<p>It seems that uncle Joe had been a
gay rollicking blade in his youth, and that
Mrs. Barbara had considered him rather
beneath her daughter, and had opposed
the match, "solely upon aristocratic
grounds," to use her own expression; but
finally, in consideration of Phoebe's low
forehead and freckles, she graciously consented.
Thereupon, uncle Joe, in his
usual rash and inconsiderate manner,
rushed young, high-spirited, and unbroken,
into the matrimonial yoke, and found himself
secured for life! I need not say that
he was completely broken in a fleeting
twelvemonth.</p>

<p>The daughter of Mrs. Barbara asserted
and maintained her rights with a high
hand. Year after year found her still
gaining upon the enemy (Uncle Joe), who
retreated and retreated, and being also
seized with a furious rheumatism, he
seized his pipe and took his corner, and
was no more like the dashing Joe Braxley
of the olden time, than he was like a
gaudy war elephant of Siam. His wants
were few and his pleasures were fewer.
Half his time was spent in acute rheumatic
pain, by which he was shockingly
drawn: and the other half was divided in

<!-- page 143 col 2 -->

sharp lookings-out for east winds, friendly
chattings with friends, and vigorous rubbings
with pungent liniments and bear-like
gloves, to keep the rheumatism at
bay. Ah, could that young lady, who in
bygone romantic days had so loved uncle
Joe, and who had taken out to Alabama
a broken heart, to be healed by gentle
southern breezes; could she but see the
gay young heart-breaker now! Her
youthful dream would, alas, be broken,
quite as effectually as was her heart. She
would see, instead of her crisp-locked
ideal, a bald-headed, plethoric, mild mannered
man, sitting in his corner with his
pipe, or with his bristly gloves and liniments,
intently rubbing his knee joints!
What a picture for a broken heart! What
a finale for greedy romance to digest!</p>

<p>Still, there was an old twinkle in the
corner of the eye, and a keen relish for a
joke, and the echo of a once boisterous
and hearty laugh, which pertinaciously
clung to uncle Joe, and a few sparks of
the old fire, which had resisted all the
dampers of matrimony, which shone forth
now and then, and made this hymeneal
and rheumatic captive appear a jocund
man at times.</p>

<p>Time's gorgeous panorama moved
slowly on. The spring had budded and
blossomed. The summer had blushed
and deepened and passed away, and the
flaunting crimson cloud-land, with its
burnished splendors, had sobered and
grown gray, and faded, and old Time was
in the sere and yellow leaf. Young hearts
were subdued, and old affections mellowed.
Louise's exile was not yet over. She was,
by papa's order, still pining in Mrs.
Braxley's dominions. I hope my reader
knows something of love. How he mocks
at frowns and barriers. How young lovers,
though separated, can wait, and hope,
and bear up stoutly against all cruelty,
and endure a variety of hardships and
crosses, in a manner which must seem
somewhat surprising to them after they
have attained the object of their wishes.
We all know how danger only stimulates
young lovers; and how opposition will
often change quite a commonplace and
lukewarm passion into an heroic and
sublime affair. How absence and parental
tyranny have done more for the wily god
than all the arrows in his quiver. How
the beloved in absence can be easily decked
with many imaginary beauties and
graces, which his constant presence would
too wofully dissipate. How one stolen
interview is of more value to a lover than
fifty unrebuked and prolonged sittings.
In short, how Cupid only enlists obstinate
parents in his service, and makes them
fight blindly against themselves.

<!-- page 144 col 1 -->

<p>Louise was pining in Siberia. The Siberian
monarch, Mrs. Braxley, was gone
with her sceptre of hickory to a neighbor's,
to dip. Uncle Joe and Louise were drawn
up around a three-legged table, on which
mildly and lambently shone Mrs. Braxley's
parlor lamp. Uncle Joe sat with bits of
soft wood lying on the table, which he
was fashioning with his pen-knife into all
sorts of shapes; his bald head shining
amid his iron-gray locks, like a soft shrouded
moon. Louise sat indolently rocking
in a large blue chair, absorbed in thought.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Louise? You are
terribly moped about something," said
uncle Joe, scooping out the rim of a wooden
punch bowl.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Louise, listlessly.</p>

<p>"Nothing but Dashwood. That fellow
is always uppermost in your thoughts.
You had better dismiss him, and take
Farren; at least so Mrs. Barbara and all
these clever women think. They say
Dashwood is incorrigible."</p>

<p>"Do <i>you</i> think so?" Louise asked.</p>

<p>"My dear, do not ask me; I do not
know. They say he is wasting the finest
talents in the State, and that he hasn't
the stability even to make a start in life."</p>

<p>"Ah, but he has," said my sister.</p>

<p>"I have my doubts. I should dislike
to see you throwing yourself away upon
a fellow, who, it seems, can be any thing,
and will be nothing."</p>

<p>"I tell you," said Louise, turning to the
light, and raising a pair of lustrous eyes,
"I tell you he has the strength to be any
thing. He has the noblest heart in the
world; and I&mdash;I have sounded its lowest
depths. I cannot believe such glorious
gifts can perish, any more than a sunbeam
can be drowned in the sea. You have
only to look upon his countenance and
believe. You have only to look and see
the great light shining on his brow. Ah,
the light gilds up the highest peaks, does
it not? Well, uncle Joe, it is there!"</p>

<p>"Youth, youth," said uncle Joe, in a
sad funereal note.</p>

<p>"But let me say it now, uncle Joe.
Let me say it only once, that I may not
break my word. If <i>he</i> fail, if <i>he</i> perish,
if <i>he</i> fall&mdash;then I fail, and I perish, and
I fall, too!"</p>

<p>"Stop, girl! Pray don't!" cried uncle
Joe, casting an alarmed look around; for
that good man had been taught, and firmly
believed, that walls had ears, particularly
Mrs. Braxley's walls.</p>

<p>"Don't be rash; I beg you don't be
rash. You'll repent it as sure as you
live," said uncle Joe, really alarmed at
her remarks.</p>

<p>"They are going to oppose me," continued
Louise steadily, while uncle Joe cut away

<!-- page 144 col 2 -->

furiously upon his punch bowl. "I see
them banding together&mdash;papa, grandma,
all but mamma and dear Robert&mdash;but I&mdash;I
cannot give him up."</p>

<p>As Louise expressed herself thus, her
face glowing and her eye glittering beneath
the serene globe of the lamp, and
her countenance radiant with that divine
fortitude possessed by some women in
such heavenly perfection, Dashwood, who
held the door ajar, bounded in. He caught
her to his breast, and then paid his respects
to uncle Joe, by squeezing him in
his arms until he cried out, and then he
danced several times around the table, and
finally he drew up beneath the lamp, and
informed his hearers that he was the happiest
man alive. He begged leave to repeat
it, and most forcibly to impress it
upon them, that, "recent events, together
with the absence of a respectable lady,
whose image often filled their hearts,"
said Dashwood, his eye gleaming with its
comic fire, "have conspired to render me
the most supremely happy man in the
world."</p>

<p>Uncle Joe slapped his rheumatic knees,
and laughed at the bare idea of a certain
person's absence contributing to any body's
happiness. He regarded it as a capital
idea, a facetious and mirth-provoking conceit,
that allusion to the timely absence
of the lady who so often filled their hearts.
He hadn't "shook the cobwebs" at such
a rate since the last time, one snug evening,
after tea, it was, when Dashwood
boldly walked in at one door as she walked
out at the other, and after making his
bow to the retiring figure, he demurely
stretched himself out upon her vacant
chair, and proceeded to lament her absence,
in low pathetic modulations.</p>

<p>Poor Dashwood had such twinkling
comic eyes, and could put on such grave,
queer faces, that uncle Joe could never
resist his sallies. Indeed, uncle Joe enjoyed
these stolen visits, and though he
cried out fudge and fiddlesticks, he wickedly
delighted in the perils which this
courageous fellow encountered, with such
admirable ease and assurance. The greatest
and most bitter enemy the persecuted
lover could boast, was Mrs. Braxley, and
his greatest admirer the timid, but once
rash, uncle Joe. Therefore, uncle Joe
always shook the reckless dashing fellow
warmly by the hand, and invariably invited
him to look in upon them on snug
evenings, with the emphasis as I have
marked; though uncle Joe knew it was
as much as his head was worth to give
that invitation.</p>

<p>The reader sees how these Ph&oelig;bean
territories were invaded by love, and how
this Cassanova-like Dashwood, was ever

<!-- page 145 col 1 -->

ready, with his masterly ingenuity and
address, to take advantage of the most
untoward event. I dare say, had Mrs.
Braxley accidentally returned to find him
in possession of her favorite chair, he
would have met her as coolly, and with
quite as much assurance as the admirable
Cassanova displayed when he encountered
the terrible Inquisitor.</p>

<p>"You cannot guess what I have to tell
you!" cried Dashwood.</p>

<p>"Don't talk so loud, are you the town
crier, young man?" hoarsely whispered
uncle Joe in alarm.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, you cannot guess what
I have to tell you!" exclaimed the animated
lover, nothing daunted.</p>

<p>"Fudge!" muttered uncle Joe, hobbling
across the room for his pipe.</p>

<p>"Do you give it up?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I am appointed attach&eacute; to an
embassy at the Court of St. Cloud!!"
cried Dashwood, jumping up.</p>

<p>"And a precious attach&eacute; you will be,"
said uncle Joe, filling the bowl of his pipe.</p>

<p>"What do you think of that?" asked
Dashwood, his face beaming with delight.</p>

<p>"I think our Government has gone mad,
if it dreams of attaching you to any thing,"
said uncle Joe, from his fog in the corner.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha! I am very much attached
to some things. But I am going to cross
the waters, bless your soul, uncle Joe!
To Rome! think of that&mdash;to Paris&mdash;does
not that startle you? To London! How
often have you taken me to London by
the ears, until I squealed, uncle Joe'? Am
I to behold the skies of Italy, the Coliseum,
the Sistine Chapel, the Venus, the
Campagna, and the Carnival? Am I to
hear the Miserere&mdash;and stand upon the
Rialto! oh! Louise, darling girl, am I reserved
for this!"</p>

<p>"Am I," continued Dashwood, after a
pause, "to be kindly snatched by Providence,
from pleasures and temptations,
which I am too weak to resist? Am I to
be taken from my old companions, who
are reckless, extravagant and rich, while
I am reckless, extravagant and poor, because
my struggles have been seen by a
pitying eye, while I was too proud to admit
that I had struggled, and had been
conquered? Are efforts which have been
made with an earnest, but hopeless heart,
to be at length rewarded? Are old associations,
which would cling to me, to be
broken by a stronger hand than mine?"
And the lover's eye was moist, and there
was a mellow glow upon his face, which
was of heaven. "Heigho!" he said, pausing
again, "Bob dislikes to give me up,
and all the fellows dislike to give me up,
and some of the girls, eh Louise? declare

<!-- page 145 col 2 -->

they cannot give me up, but this will be
the making of me. This will break up
old habits and old associations, but not
old loves, remember, and it is to be the
making of me. We have been trying for
months to secure this appointment. Bob,
poor fellow, has toiled like a capitalist, and
corresponded like a Home Secretary, about
this attach&eacute;ship for me. And now we've
got it, and I rushed in to tell you. I
brushed Mrs. Braxley's respectable sleeve
on the road, to tell you this; I invaded her
jail, and scared my dear uncle Joe, to tell
him this!"</p>

<p>Again there was silence, and uncle Joe,
as the wreathing smoke coiled itself fantastically
above his head, was heard to
murmur "too rash, too rash," and puffed
on.</p>

<p>"Now," continued Dashwood, "Mrs.
Braxley, estimable lady, can dip on, if she
will only refrain from dipping into me.
Uncle Joe, I shall leave my girl with you.
If Tom Farren come near her, do you
chunk him with your crutch with my
compliments. If Mrs. Braxley attempt to
entice her away from me, speak up for me
uncle Joe. Speak up, and say how I have
ever esteemed Mrs. Braxley, you know
how I have never failed to bemoan her absence
in mournful numbers, on all accidental
occasions like the present. How I have
secured this appointment by Herculean
feats, of which she did not deem me capable.
How, in my heart, I cannot blame
her for her jealous watching of my Louise.
How I wish I could only engage her services
on my side until I return. How I
honor and respect her, and lament my
own unworthiness. How I shall leave my
native land with the determination never
to return until I can come worthy of her
good opinion. Will you tell her this for
me, uncle Joe?"</p>

<p>"Lord bless your soul, man,&mdash;no! It
would be the rashest thing I ever did!"
returned uncle Joe, puffing away vehemently.
"No," continued that good man,
gently relenting, "but I have had my eyes
upon you, Frank, ever since you were so
high;" and uncle Joe laid his hand, in a parental
manner, upon the back of a chair,
"ever since, with an arm no bigger than
the round of this chair, you fetched the
d&mdash;d schoolmaster that famous lick, plump
in the black of his eye, for whipping Bob,
you know. 'Twas well done for a youngster,
and properly done, and I said the
good metal was there. I knew the good
old ring when I heard it, I said that was
the genuine article. I did not think it was
rash then, ah no, hang me; I wanted a
pull at the Yankee bully my self, and while
your mamma&mdash;rest her soul&mdash;apologized
to the Yankee, and scolded you, and cried

<!-- page 146 col 1 -->

about your disgraceful and ill-mannered
behavior to your preceptor, and all that,
I&mdash;I believe upon my word, I was the man
who gave you half a dollar, and a dozen
striped marbles, and told you when he
needed it, to give it to him again!"</p>

<p>"The very man!" cried Dashwood,
grasping his hand.</p>

<p>"And," returned the once rash man,
gently knocking the ashes from his pipe,
"and I am as confident of your success,

<!-- page 146 col 2 -->

Frank, as I am of&mdash;of&mdash;Mrs. Braxley's
return as soon as the clock is done
striking."</p>

<p>"Verbum sap," said Dashwood, kissing
Louise's hand, and retiring with his accustomed
grace and ease. I may as well
say that Mrs. Braxley returned true to the
minute, rang for family prayers, and gave
her hearers an impromptu prayer, of great
power and length.</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="small">THIS CHAPTER, WITH THE READER'S PERMISSION, IS
DEDICATED TO CUPID.</p>

</div>

<p>MR. ROBERT RUSHTON'S time was devoted
exclusively to his friend Dashwood.
He must be with Frank, morning, noon, and
night. He was seldom at home. He had
always some business or an engagement
with Frank. They found time amid
their multifarious duties, to take a mysterious
trip together to see Mrs. Blanton.
Dashwood came back enraptured with
her. He told mamma&mdash;who had doubtless
in her anxiety for her son, commissioned
him to keep an eye upon Therese&mdash;that he
was proud of Robert's choice&mdash;for it was
not art, he said, which made Therese so
enchanting, but nature. Nature so perfectly
beautiful, that he had mistaken it

<!-- page 253 col 2 -->

for the perfection of art, for which he begged
the dear dimpled creature's pardon.</p>

<p>Having made the <i>amende</i> to Mrs. Blanton,
Dashwood, who was getting his affairs
in order, previous to his departure to
foreign parts, drew me to the window,
and begged me with moist eye, and nervous
lip, to take good care of Louise for
him.</p>

<p>"If she cries for me, when I am gone&mdash;ah,
if she hangs about your neck, and sobs
for me in the long, still hours&mdash;comfort
her, Jenny, and keep her hopeful, and cheerful
for me, will you? Do not let her go
off by herself to weep; cheer her up for
me, my good Jenny, I must not think of
her, all drooping and tearful&mdash;and yet&mdash;and
yet," said he, half musing, "I would
not have her careless and gay." I smiled.</p>

<!-- page 254 col 1 -->

<p>"I tell you, dear Jenny" he said, "I
would like her to be resigned and hopeful,
but not remarkably lively,&mdash;you understand?"</p>

<p>"Very well," said I, "I shall exhort
my sister to endeavor to poise herself midway
between joy and sorrow. I shall
tell her that, while I am to try very much
to amuse her, she is not to be at all amused."
"Heigho!" began poor Dashwood, with
a rueful face, "what a time I shall have
with my attach&eacute;ship! What long, long
hours I must endure before I can be with
you all again!"</p>

<p>"But you two are determined?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Determined! I tell you no word in
the English language can express the
firmness of our purpose. Determined!
death cannot part us. Mr. Rushton, your
estimable father, is, I am happy to say,
only a feather in our estimation, Mrs. Barbara
a mere puff of wind, Mrs. Braxley
a mop to be jumped over on our way to
church."</p>

<p>"And uncle Joe?"</p>

<p>"Pooh&mdash;small potatoes," said Dashwood
with an air. I was not then aware
that uncle Joe had deserted the family
party, and gone over to the enemy. Such
knowledge being considered, by his friends,
as highly dangerous to circulate, and as
calculated to embitter the domestic peace
of that most worthy man.</p>

<p>Papa was highly pleased at Dashwood's
appointment; and Tom Farren delivered
quite a speech upon the occasion. Poor
Robert declared that he had rather part
with his right hand than with Frank, but
he added, "If I thought it necessary to
amputate my right hand, it should be cut
off, and I would try and do with the left."
Mrs. Barbara inquired where St. Cloud
was, and if Mr. Dashwood was likely to
meet with a very dear friend of hers, who
had gone with her husband to Rio. If so,
would he be kind enough to take charge
of a steel bag, and a pair of button-hole
scissors, which it seems, that friend had
left at Mrs. Barbara's on her last visit.</p>

<p>Mamma hoped he would not be shipwrecked,
or robbed, or caught by the Inquisition,
or, above all, go over to the
Pope.</p>

<p>Robert hoped he would write some telling
letters to the Star, and let people
know what he was about.</p>

<p>During this visit, which was about a
fortnight before Dashwood's departure,
papa took him kindly by the hand, and
led him into the library.</p>

<p>"My dear young friend," he said handing
him a seat, and then settling down in
his large leather chair, "I am extremely

<!-- page 254 col 2 -->

gratified at this appointment; I <i>am</i> your
friend, though I have never flattered you&mdash;perhaps
your best friends do not flatter
you. Well, Mr. Dashwood, the last conversation
we had in this room was not a
very pleasant one, but I must beg that
you will continue to bear it in mind."</p>

<p>"There is no danger of my forgetting it,
sir," said Dashwood quickly.</p>

<p>"What I said then I repeat to-day; my
daughter must <i>not</i> be troubled by your
proposals."</p>

<p>"I have no proposals to make to the
young lady, sir."</p>

<p>"I hope not. I have other views for
my daughter, Mr. Dashwood."</p>

<p>"So you have taken the trouble to inform
me very many times, sir."</p>

<p>"And I wish it distinctly understood."</p>

<p>"I am quick at apprehension, sir."</p>

<p>"That I oppose the affair <i>in toto</i>. The
long engagement, the promise to wait until
you make a fortune, the idle notion
about congeniality, and all the foolish visions
which have flitted across the brains
of all the foolish lovers in the world. I
tell you, fortunes and great names are
not so easily made. I tell you, every
young man of talent is not bound to
succeed. I tell you the most strenuous
actions are not always crowned with
success&mdash;that our most ardent wishes
had better not be realized sometimes.
Bless my soul, suppose all my wild visions
had been realized! where would I
have been now, in the name of common
sense? Suppose I had married my sister's
pretty governess for whom I was actually
run mad a whole year! Bless my
soul&mdash;we had better leave these things to
Providence, Mr. Dashwood. Young ladies
of eighteen, and high-spirited fellows
of twenty-two, had better not take their
destinies into their own hands. I tell
you it is wrong&mdash;morally wrong; and
you will thank me for all this, some day,
if you live&mdash;indeed you will."</p>

<p>"My dear sir, I do not blame you for
refusing me your daughter's hand; I esteem
you for it. I esteem all her friends
who have her interests so much at heart.
Time can only prove what we are. If I
were to say to you now, that ten years
hence, I shall be this or that, you would
laugh at me. Very well, I say no such
thing. But I say <i>nous verrons</i>."</p>

<p>"Exactly&mdash;<i>nous verrons</i>. You go off
to a foreign court, young, and unfettered
by promises, you will come back with a
little more knowledge of men and things.
Exactly sir, <i>nous verrons</i>."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. I shall return to bid
your family farewell, with your permission,"
said Dashwood rising.</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;come by all means. I

<!-- page 255 col 1 -->

shall be happy to see you. Good morning,"
and papa opened the door, and shook
the hand of his guest, with much cordiality.</p>

<p>Mrs. Braxley brought Louise home,
and in a few days Dashwood came to pay
his last formal visit to our family.</p>

<p>Now, poor fellow, his "jests and gibes"
were gone. He could no longer rally and
be gay. The laughing lip quivered, and
the lustrous eye, with its comic fire, was
filled to the brim. Once or twice he
made an effort to be himself, but it would
not do. The light spirit was trailing in
the dust, the quick retort and happy repartee
were stifled, and the merry laugh
no longer rang around the family circle
as in the bright days which were flown.
Louise was never alone with him during
this visit. Papa was all attention to his
guest, and Mrs. Barbara and suite mustered
about him. My sister went on careless,
indolent, and calm. Papa marked
with pride the same lofty air and graceful
ease&mdash;and he thought the dreamer dreamed
no more. Dashwood strove to emulate
her in her perfect show of insensibility;
but he hadn't the self-command of
the imperious Louise. And from the
filmed eye, flushed cheek, and nervous,
restless manner, one saw the anguish of
his manly, loving heart, and pitied him for
the struggles he so bravely made.</p>

<p>The hour was coming&mdash;coming with
pulsating step, when these two, so different,
and yet so united, were to part.
Louise stood calm and clear, under papa's
eye, waiting to say farewell. Mrs. Barbara
stood looking on, as Dashwood, after
shaking every body by the hand, turned
firmly and steadily to Louise. He took
her hand, and not a tear, or faltering word
betrayed the mighty strength of that
love which so many had tried in vain to
sever.</p>

<p>Louise bade him "God speed" in a
dear, unshaken voice, and he made his bow,
and left us standing in the hall. I saw
him brush away a tear as he gathered the
reins in his hand&mdash;and I saw him wring
Robert's hand as though his heart was
breaking,&mdash;but this was all I saw.</p>

<p>My sister, as though to test to the utmost
limit the great strength of her poor
woman's heart, remained standing some
fifteen minutes with papa and mamma in
the hall. And though she felt that all
eyes were upon her, she never faltered or
quailed, but stood conversing with them
carelessly, as though nothing had happened.
Papa took his hat and stick,
and walked out. Mrs. Barbara returned
to her knitting, and Mrs. Braxley to
her snuff, and Louise walked carelessly
away.</p>

<!-- page 255 col 2 -->

<p>But in her quiet room her woman's nature
triumphed. Here, the pent-up tears
flooded the lustrous eyes, and she fell
upon my neck, and yielded to the luxury
of unrestrained emotion. Here, the woman's
nature shone forth in all its strength.
Here, the calm and placid girl shivered
with emotion. Here, poor Louise threw
off the outer garment of proud insensibility,
and sobbed convulsively, and prayed,
and refused all comfort and all hope.
She drew from her bosom his miniature,
and a bit of poetry which the guarded
lover had scribbled off for her eye alone,
on his last visit. As some evidence of the
talents with which poor Dashwood was
gifted, I transcribe it for the reader.</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="center">FOR MY LOUISE.</p>

<p>Well, we have met&mdash;nor have our eyes<br/>

Revealed the secret they could tell,<br/>

Nor blushing cheek, nor faintest sighs<br/>

Betrayed the truth we knew so well.</p>

<p>A mystic chain between us lay,<br/>

In airy links, unseen and still;<br/>

From heart to heart its fairy way,<br/>

Electric in its mighty thrill.</p>

<p>A breath, a tone, a careless note,<br/>

Would vibrate on each magic round,<br/>

In airy circles surely float,<br/>

Reaching the heart with lightest bound.</p>

<p>Oh Love! how subtle is thy power,<br/>

How wonderful thy changing ways,<br/>

Compressing years in one short hour,<br/>

And making dreary, summer days.</p>

<p>Louise&mdash;ah! should I never come<br/>

To claim each promise, and each vow;<br/>

Keep them, my darling, for our home,<br/>

All star-lighted above us now.</p>

<p>Keep them, Louise, all pure and true,<br/>

Keep them&mdash;ah, I'll wait them there;<br/>

Keep them&mdash;nor utter them anew,<br/>

Nor breathe them, save to Heaven in prayer.</p>

<p>Keep them&mdash;nor tell them save to Heaven,<br/>

In stilly hours, where none are near;<br/>

The jealous spirit floats at even,<br/>

Perhaps such precious vows to hear.</p>

<p>Once more adieu!&mdash;my heavy heart<br/>

Goes on its weary way alone:<br/>

Since loving, trusting, we must part,<br/>

'Twere better quickly, coldly done.</p>

<p>And parted! oh! the bitter tears,<br/>

And fears, which loving heart ne'er flees,<br/>

And midnight vigils long as years,<br/>

And days&mdash;all wanting my Louise!</p>

</div>

<p>"Oh, he is gone, Jenny&mdash;gone&mdash;and all
is blank!" cried my sister, her heart realizing
anew the full extent of her sorrow.
Somebody tapped gently at our door, and
Robert came in, and threw himself upon
the bed and wept like a child. He drew
Louise to him, and whispered to her, and
laid her stricken head upon his bosom,
and these two children of prosperity sobbed
together over their first sorrow.</p>

<p>"Jenny, you must help me to take
care of this poor little thing. We must
stand by her, sister Jenny, through thick
and thin. We must console her, and minister
to her in her grief, for she is a tender

<!-- page 256 col 1 -->

creature, Jenny, and we must shield
her for his sake;" and then our gentle
Robert wiped his eyes, and kissed her,
and tried to be cheerful and stout of heart.
"There's a better time coming, little sis&mdash;a
happy time coming. The sun does not
always shine, little sis, and clouds and
darkness are quite as useful as the sun.
Come, Louise&mdash;cheer up, my pretty pet.
You can be brave, I know. Come, little
sis, remember all is for the best." And
Robert took her in his lap, and with tears
in his eyes, talked of being strong and
brave.</p>

<p>Dear mamma, with her mother's instinct,
came gently in and sat down by
her suffering child, and spoke like one
who had suffered and had endured. After
these little outbursts of uncontrollable
emotion, Louise recovered her usual calm
self-possession, and we sat in our little
room&mdash;the indulgent mother, and her
children, talking in the twilight until tea
time. Robert was chief spokesman of
course. Under all dispensations, he was
voluble and wise. He was always kind
to those in trouble, and was never more
happy than when in sad, chastened hours,
he could hang about mamma, and caress
her, and fondle about her, like a child. I
need not say that this handsome, tender
son, was the pride of my mother's heart.
Robert declared to mamma, upon his
honor, that Frank Dashwood was the
noblest fellow in the world. And he
took that opportunity to favor Louise and
me with such lectures on matrimony, as
few debutantes are privileged to hear.
My brother said if a handsome woman
married a rich fool, who would lavish
every dollar he had upon her, she might
be happy, provided she possessed none of
that exquisite delicacy which was the first
charm of her sex. Provided, also, that
she had no conscience&mdash;not a bit&mdash;no generosity&mdash;no
pride&mdash;and had been pinched
by poverty all her life. To such women
money was happiness. He said his sister
Louise, with her reserve, her modesty,
her delicate nature, her extreme sensibilities,
could not be happy with Tom Farren.
Because Tom Farren was such a
machine of a man. So severe, so stiff, so
formal, so built up in his own rectitude,
so hard and common-sensible, "that he
would break this regal flower of ours,
mamma, in less than two years," said my
brother earnestly. "Her beautiful eccentricities
would be harshly put down&mdash;her
tears would be childish&mdash;her whims unbecoming,
and all that. I know Tom
Farren&mdash;every body must bend to him.
He is a walking model in his own estimation,
and every body must walk exactly
by his rules. And I know Dashwood. I

<!-- page 256 col 2 -->

have tested his heart and soul. He is
chivalrous, magnanimous, glorious. Let
him succeed. Let him&mdash;God bless him&mdash;come
back renewed and re-established,
and I will be responsible for this dear
girl's happiness."</p>

<p>"But, my son, your papa knows best."</p>

<p>"We will not discuss the subject," said
my sister with dignity, and the supper
bell rang merrily, and we obeyed the
summons.</p>

<p>Poor Robert had a difficult task before
him, viz., to storm the library and sound
papa concerning Mrs. Blanton. Papa was
remarkably cautious and reserved. He
had treated Mrs. Blanton not only with
marked respect, but sometimes playfully,
and almost affectionately. But this was
no proof that he thought her worthy of
his son. There were not many who could
aspire to that honor. Papa thought Robert
destined for great things, and Robert
thought Mrs. Blanton was on the very
pinnacle of greatness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Braxley, who was staying with
us, expressed herself as being glad that
Dashwood was gone, and wished Mrs.
Blanton could receive an appointment of
the kind immediately. Mrs. Barbara repeated
for our edification, that she had no
opinion of widows with little boys, turning
out their shoulders, and stripping
their arms, and coquetting with every
green-horn in the whole country; and
went on with string after string of anecdote,
illustrative, and forcibly bearing
upon the subject in hand, with divers catastrophes
and horrible denouements, of a
startling and extraordinary nature. Mrs.
Braxley had collected a budget concerning
the widow in her dippings. She had
learned from some of the mop sisterhood
that she had made the deceased Blanton
see sights.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you all so?" inquired
Mrs. Barbara, looking around. But none
of us remembered her ever having intimated
to us that Therese had made her
husband see sights.</p>

<p>Mrs. Braxley went on to say that the
late Johnston Blanton had died of yellow
fever in Mobile, it was true, but she understood
that his system had been previously
undermined by a train of nervous
disorders, brought on by jealousy, for
which, it seemed, Mrs. B. had given him
sufficient cause.</p>

<p>"I'll be bound she did!" broke in Mrs.
Barbara. "I'll be bound she aggravated
that man to death. Why I have known
more people aggravated to death," said
grandma, with open eyes. "Gracious!"</p>

<p>Of course nobody disputed this alarming
fact.</p>

<p>Mrs. Braxley still running on, undisturbed

<!-- page 257 col 1 -->

by grandma's shrill remarks, continued.
She represented the artless, exuberant
Therese with her overflowing,
boundless heart, and good will towards
all mankind, as a wicked, vexatious little
imp&mdash;destroying the peace of every family
into which she entered&mdash;and as being
leagued with the yellow fever, and the
green-eyed monster, to carry destruction
into all quarters. She was notoriously
fond of waltzing, and polking with beardless
youths, easily overcome by her wiles.
She was, furthermore, excessively fond of
Mr. Blanton, and made nothing of treating
him in a most sisterly manner.
The family convocation about this delightful
Therese was held in mamma's
room. Aunt Braxley had related her
dippings, flourishing her tooth-brush with
great effect. Grandma had made several
blunders, but on the whole her remarks
were caustic and telling. Poor Bob had
battled for his sweetheart manfully, telling
of her simplicity, her gentle charities,
her meekness, and forgiving heart. Mamma
had related how Therese, during her
memorable visit to Fairy Hill, would
leave the gay company to come and sit in
her room and have a quiet chat with her,
and how tender and charming she was.
Louise had said how she loved her, and
how she had rather Robert would marry
her than the queen of all the Brazils.
And I had told how she had stolen her
soft arm around my waist, and asked me
so innocently if I loved her?</p>

<p>"As though any body could help loving
her!" cried Robert.</p>

<p>Just then papa came in, and inquired
what we were all talking about.</p>

<p>"Why, about this widow who has come
here and turned Robert's head," said the
ever ready Mrs. Barbara.</p>

<p>"Turned Robert's head! His head is
not so easily turned, depend upon it."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe the harf (half) of
that," returned the sapient dame. "I
have had beaux, a few of them, report
says;" Mrs. Barbara had been a famous
belle. "At all events, I know enough of
courting and love-scrapes generally, to
know when a young gudgeon nibbles at
a bait (which has been passed and re-passed,
and seen through by wiser fish, I
fancy), and then, like a certain young man
not a hundred miles from here, gulps
down the hook and the line, to the infinite
wonder and amusement of connoisseurs
in that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut&mdash;I hope I shall hear no more
of this," said papa. "Mrs. Blanton indeed!"</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Rushton," interposed
mamma, her eyes filling with tears at
Robert's discomfiture.</p>

<!-- page 257 col 2 -->

<p>"Be quiet, my dear, Mr. Robert Rushton
should know better."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said the dowager; "he
should really know better. Why, Sappingwood
is a Solomon to her."</p>

<p>"I beg that you will not speak of her in
that way," said Robert, knitting his brow.</p>

<p>"And I beg some consideration for one
who has been our guest," remarked the
elegant and impassive Louise, from the
lounge.</p>

<p>"Hoity, toity!" cried grandma. "It
seems that I have aroused a hornet's nest.
I am constrained to remark, at the peril
of my ears, that young Mr. Hornet's
moustache will have to exert itself considerably
before the uncommon glibness of
his tongue can annihilate me exactly."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" said papa. "I wonder, Robert,
that you are so silly. I expected a flirtation
between Mrs. Blanton and yourself,
but, upon my word, I was not prepared
for any further exhibition of folly."</p>

<p>"I do not like to reply to you now, sir,"
said Robert, handing papa, who was standing,
a chair. "I might be tempted to say
something which I should regret. We will
dismiss the subject, if you please."</p>

<p>The reader can form no idea of the inimitable
grace of these words, or of my
handsome brother's beautiful and respectful
manner. He softened all hearts, and
dispelled all acrimony.</p>

<p>Mrs. Braxley, who had not been figuring
at all during the latter part of the conversation,
now thought it time for prayers.
She was a professed expounder and exhorter.
She did not mind rising in a
crowded church and giving out an appointment
for her neighborhood. Indeed she
did not mind doing any thing she chose to
do. She always rang in the servants,
during her visitations and gave us prayers.
And such prayers! None of your lack-a-daisical,
lukewarm affairs, but fervent,
strong, knock-down-and-drag-out improvisations.</p>

<p>She prayed for rain if she wanted rain.
She called sinners by their names, and
prayed for their speedy disenthralment
from the bondage of sin.</p>

<p>But, as I was saying, after much ringing,
and scolding, and "blessings over the
left shoulder," as Sap called them, she succeeded
in gathering in our straggling undisciplined
troops. She then read the sermon
on the mount, and sang the Old Hundred,
after which she favored us with one of her
strongest impromptus. She had a clear,
ringing voice, and the ready words came
trippingly on her tongue, and Mrs. Braxley
would have made no ordinary preacher.
After a soul-searching and Satan-exterminating
prayer, of nearly a half an hour
in length, we all received her benediction

<!-- page 258 col 1 -->

and arose from our recumbent position,
save my brother's devout man Sappingwood,
who thought proper to remain on
his knees in an attitude of profound devotion.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see Sappingwood so religious,"
remarked grandma, in a loud
whisper to the company, while Sappingwood
still remained upon his bended knees.</p>

<p>"Sappingwood, you will please finish
your devotions elsewhere," said papa, as
the servants retired. Grandma then approached
him gently, and tapping him on
the back with her spectacle case, said,
"Sappingwood, you will please finish your
devotions elsewhere."</p>

<p>At which Sap started up, rubbed his
eyes, scratched his head, and seeing grandma,
cried out "the devil!" and took to
his heels, running over "eight foot eleven,"
as he called Epsey, and finally made but
one step from the head of the stairs to
the landing.</p>

<p>Poor Sap had fallen asleep under Mrs.
Braxley's soporific prayer, being the most
sleepy-headed nigger, grandma informed
us, between this and a brother of his she
had sold somewhere, wherever that was.</p>

<p>Not very long after this, Robert stormed
the library, and informed papa in a pathetic
manner, that he was dying for Mrs.
Blanton, actually dwindling away, and
losing his appetite (in the height of the
strawberry season too, said my romantic
brother), because Therese would cruelly
persist in being so enchanting.</p>

<p>"And what have you done with your
old flame, Mary Jennings?" asked papa,
turning round in his chair, that he might
get a better view of his hopeful.</p>

<p>"Mary Jennings!" said Robert, slightly
coloring. "why, when <i>have</i> I thought of
Mary Jennings?"</p>

<p>"Exactly, and yet that girl alarmed me
for twelve months."</p>

<p>"But she is not like Therese, nobody
is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no, I suspect not, and the next one
will doubtless eclipse Therese."</p>

<p>"Well," said Robert, laughing, "will
you try me a year, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, two of them, if you like. Come
to me in a year, if we all live, and tell
me that you are still true to Therese, and
that Therese is still true to <i>you</i>, mind that,
and my blessing will be upon you both."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. If&mdash;if&mdash;by that time
we are changed, I will go right off and
propose to Col. Fletcher's daughter, upon
my word."</p>

<p>"As a personal favor to your indulgent
father," said papa.</p>

<p>"And," said Robert, "any other cross-eyed
lady of your acquaintance can be
favorably noticed about that time."</p>

<!-- page 258 col 2 -->

<p>I must explain to the reader that Maria
Fletcher was what is called cock-eyed,
though immensely rich, and of distinguished
family, and that she was an old
bone of contention between papa and
Robert.</p>

<p>"You will at least have learned, I sincerely
hope," remarked papa, "that happiness
in this life does not exactly depend
upon the turn of a lady's eye."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," replied Robert, "I expect
to find it sadly inconvenient to repeat
the story of my love to a lady with one
eye full upon me and the other out of the
window."</p>

<p>"A trifle," said papa, and the conversation
ended rather differently from what
Mr. Rushton, junior, expected.</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that difficulties in another
quarter beset my brother. Therese
wrote him a little odorous letter, containing
rather a startling and unique proposition.
She proposed, with her usual
na&iuml;vet&eacute;, that they should endeavor to forget
each other, and that she really thought
Mr. Blanton would die if she rejected him
again.</p>

<p>He had taken his bed when she told
him all about "an affair," the dear little
woman said, and had never gotten up until
she promised to be off with Robert.
Therese went on to say, that she and Robert
were young and could forget perhaps,
and form new ties, while poor Mr. Blanton
was getting old&mdash;indeed was bald under
his scratch (!)&mdash;and turning gray&mdash;and
had proved so&mdash;oh terribly constant, that
she was really afraid he might die, if she
persisted in being so cruel as dear Mr.
Rushton had advised.</p>

<p>Such a note my brother returned to
this confiding, pliant creature, as would
make one's hair stand on end. He wrote,
that of course Mrs. Blanton could consult
her own wishes about the matter&mdash;he had
nothing to say&mdash;and would respectfully
withdraw his proposals, rather than submit
the lady to any such heart-rending
trials as she had described.</p>

<p>After this, my handsome brother wore
a sneer upon his lip, and read Byron with
wonderful relish.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">CONTAINS ALL I SAW AT THE FAMOUS BLACK MOUNTAIN
SPRINGS, AND MORE BESIDES.</p>

</div>

<p>IN due time the season arrived for every
bird of passage to take flight. Dress-makers
were sewing night and day, and
spry clerks excessively active. Robert
graciously offered to take Louise and
myself to the famous Black Mountain
Springs (which, by some mysterious agency,
were to be the fashion that season),

<!-- page 259 col 1 -->

provided we religiously promised to
obey him in all things. He said we must,
by all means, take our own maids, buy
more dresses than we ever had in all our
lives, and exert ourselves during the whole
season to do honor to the family. He did
not want to feel ashamed of his sisters.
They must go in style, and hold high
heads if they were going with him.
Having agreed to abide by his instructions
in all things, to hold high heads, and
to take our own maids, active preparations
commenced. Grandma and aunt Braxley
were at loggerheads about Louise's
outfit. The dowager was bent upon sending
her to the Springs dressed out as the
belles of her day. She wanted to lay in
a large stock of spangles, wax beads, paste
buckles, and bugles. She had known several
persons, in her day, married solely
by the skilful use of beads, spangles, and
paste buckles. Nay, she instanced one Julianna
Ruggles, whose ringlets had made
her a belle. And having been made a
belle by these ringlets, she was courted
by James Maclin, who courted all the
belles; indeed, ladies were not established
belles in those days, until they had
been courted by James Maclin. Well, he
courted her, and she, contrary to all precedent,
took him. Knowing what she did,
she accepted him.</p>

<p>"For," said grandma, "I am coming
to a horrible denouement. Robert, yours
is nothing to it. She knew, the fiendish
woman knew, they were false&mdash;the ringlets!
and that her head was as bald as
the palm of my hand! There she had
the advantage of beau Maclin, and she
clamped him, to the delight of every
body&mdash;and he was a belle-hating and a
ringlet-distrusting man, from that day
forth."</p>

<p>By such reminiscences as these, our estimable
grandma prepared us for the
Black Mountain Springs, which she evidently
regarded as a battle-field. She
said that girls who could do nothing for
themselves at the Black Mountain Springs,
might as well give up. There had been
more matches made, and mischief done,
at those Springs, than at any watering-place
of her acquaintance. While we
were making our preparations for our
summer tour, this dear old lady was going
mysteriously about, with old rusty
bunches of keys, and bringing out from
secret repositories the pride of her youth,
in the shape of trinkets, and silks, and
satins. She presented Louise with several
large oval brooches, with tombstones
and weeping-willows upon them, which
she said were wrought with her great,
great grandmother's remarkable hair.
She gave us a large box of Spa beads,

<!-- page 259 col 2 -->

as large as partridge-eggs, which she said
would produce quite a sensation at the
Black Mountain, as doubtless they would.
She strung my sister's fingers with numerous
gold rings, with little odd-looking,
bug-shaped stones upon them, to each of
which there was a tremendous history
attached. Finally, she lugged out, triumphantly,
the identical crimson brocade
which she had sported on the night of
the calamitous conflagration.</p>

<p>In the mean time, mamma and Mrs.
Braxley were coming home every evening
laden with purchases.</p>

<p>Louise was happy and pleased. Papa
opened his eyes at the bills which were
handed to him by these industrious ladies,
and seemed to think that one more
trip to the Black Mountain would put
him up to the highest bidder.</p>

<p>Robert had Sappingwood and the horses
in training, and they were driving and
dashing about every day, preparatory to
a series of flourishes to be cut on the
scene of action. The Black Mountain
Springs, from their out-of-the-way location,
were about to find themselves famous.
The fashionables were growing
semi-barbarous, and were pining to get
beyond the great thoroughfare, to an
Elysium where democratic steam could
not penetrate. My brother, rather than
endure uncomfortable inns, and a circuitous
route, concluded to go by public conveyance.
Sap was therefore sent on with
the carriage and horses, and we took the
cars. At the railroad station we met the
Blantons, bound, also, for the Black Mountain.</p>

<p>Robert met Therese very coldly, which
evidently pained the little woman very
much. The coaches on the up train were
very much crowded, and our party was
separated. Robert found himself seated
with a knot of college mates, I, with an
unprotected female, Louise with Miss
Willianna, and Mr. Blanton, Therese,
and Adolphe at the lower end of the
car.</p>

<p>In travelling, Mrs. Blanton was the
most interesting and accommodating little
creature in the world. She would not
take the best seat she could find, neither
would she deprive polite gentlemen of
comfortable quarters on any consideration.
She held Adolphe on her lap, and
sent his "bonne" into another car, in order
to accommodate an elderly lady with
a lounge. Finally, after doing all she
could, to make the ladies, and invalids,
and children, around her, comfortable,
this dear little woman and her cherub
boy both fell asleep, and my brother's
eyes rested upon them in spite of himself.
He watched the charming tableau

<!-- page 260 col 1 -->

with a countenance of vivid pleasure.
Therese sat with her head thrown back,
her veil half fallen off, her soft lids
closed, and Adolphe's curly head resting
on her arm, while Blanton sat stark
and stiff on the outside, guarding these
treasures with a grim smile.</p>

<p>But on stopping, Mrs. Blanton was the
busiest and most earnest little body&mdash;gathering
up Adolphe, and all the books,
shawls, and carpet-bags, belonging to our
party, that she could lay her little hands
upon. All this time my brother scarcely
interchanged a syllable with her. When
we came to the staging he could stand it
no longer. She was entirely too natural,
too busy, too earnest, too irresistible.
Taking the most out-of-the-way little naps,
saying the most charming things&mdash;and all
the while pulling and lugging Adolphe
about, like a great doll. Tourists were
inquiring who the darling little woman
was, and Adolphe was a pet with every
body.</p>

<p>My brother tried to keep his eyes away
from her, tried not to hear her, or to observe
any thing she did; but this provoking
little woman was too enticing for his
philosophy. He found himself ever near
her, being drawn more and more to her,
and once when she looked up at him and
smiled, my brother could have taken her
to his heart for very thankfulness.</p>

<p>These horrible stages going to the Black
Mountain Springs, were, of course, crowded.
The weather was intensely warm, and
people's equanimity put to the test. Few
could preserve their amiability under all
provocations. Ladies often looked sour,
and gentlemen looked daggers while performing
civilities. Early one morning we
were seated in a pleasant coach, and a
stirring breeze came down from the
mountains, and we were expecting every
minute to be dashing along the beautiful
turnpike&mdash;when&mdash;horror of horrors!&mdash;a
large, fat, hot-looking man, presented
himself at the door, and looked around
keenly for a seat. Passengers were civilly
requested to make room for this very
warm-looking man, of only three hundred
pounds.</p>

<p>Now Mrs. Blanton, Adolphe, and Robert
were cosily seated on the back seat; and
ere Robert could enter a protest, Therese
had taken Adolphe on her lap, and drawn
herself up in a corner, leaving an alarmingly
wide space between herself and her
almost reconciled lover, to be filled up by
this monster man. Seeing this, Robert
sprang to her side, determined that no
such formidable barrier should come between
them, and told her so. She laughed,
and the fat man came down with an
"ah" and wedged himself in. I may say

<!-- page 260 col 2 -->

that Therese and my brother had now a
very close conversation, and, that never
had this charming woman felt nearer to
him than during the twelve miles he thus
travelled. Perhaps I had better request
the reader to see a moral in this, as I am
not likely to have a moral ready for him
at the close of the volume. "It is an
ill wind that blows nobody any good."
Who would have thought that that large,
overheated man, could have contributed
to any body's happiness, by jamming himself
in a crowded stage-coach? And yet,
my brother Robert found himself supremely
happy. Thus we see the most
untoward events are fraught with good
for somebody&mdash;and therefore we should
never complain of untoward events, because
they may ultimately develope themselves
for our good.</p>

<p>A lady fainted in this crowded coach,
and though she was old and common looking,
Therese hung over her, and finally
restored her with something she found
away down in her carpet bag. Such evidences
of this dear woman's overflowing
goodness of heart and perfect unselfishness,
were constantly occurring. Amid
disorder she was calm. When others
were complaining and railing against contractors,
agents, and other discomforts, she
was quiet, cool, and pleasant, and not unfrequently
rebuked without a word, and
restored good humor by her example. My
brother, over head and ears in love, finally
reached the Black Mountain Springs.
We arrived on a clear, tingling morning,
and found our rooms awaiting us.</p>

<p>We found all the fashionables assembled
at this retired and rustic looking watering-place.
Happy groups were dotting the
green-sward. Invalids were creeping
painfully about. Children and nurses
were wandering in all directions, animating
the groves and waking up the solitudes.
Ladies were talking in knots of
twos and threes. Beautiful girls were
sitting in piazzas surrounded by beaux.
Romantic lovers were threading the distant
groves. Dandies were attitudinizing
and turning their glasses upon the belles.
Carriages were dashing in every direction.
Gentlemen in elegant turn-outs, were waving
their hands to gay groups as they
passed. Little French boys were talking
to their French mammas, to the amusement
of little Virginia boys, who made
faces at them. Hunting parties were going
merrily off, and pleasure was being
sought in every available form by the hundreds
congregated here.</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that our party was
very exclusive at these Springs. I regretted
this very much, as I desired, of all
things, the piquant pleasure of amusing

<!-- page 261 col 1 -->

myself in my own way, and of studying
human nature in all its curious phases, as
developed by mineral waters. But my
brother would not allow it.</p>

<p>There was an old, fussy lady parading
about with her daughters in all directions,
and talking promiscuously to every body,
who I was sure was a character, and I
was very anxious to accept her invitation
to drop into her cabin at odd hours; but
Mr. Robert Rushton never heard of such
a thing in his life! Then, there was the
singing young lady, and the polking company,
and an old beau, who, I am convinced,
desired to make my acquaintance, but
Mr. Robert Rushton said no, decidedly no.
And down at the Spring I encountered a
most pleasant lady and courtier-like gentleman,
who were most elegantly and exquisitely
dressed, had travelled every
where and seen every thing in the world
worth seeing, and who were really so
charming and delightful, and withal so
refined, that I promised to call on them,
and, indeed, had arranged an excursion to
a remarkable cave with them, when I was
informed by my brother that I should
have cut them; that they were not of our
set. And so, by my contract, I was bound
to cut them the next morning at breakfast.
The reader will perceive that I know nothing
about etiquette and exclusiveness, and
that my exquisite brother and fastidious
sister had all the care of the family honors,
inasmuch as I really could not find
out, for the life of me, "who was who."
I was a bewildered and benighted woman,
during the whole of this memorable
season; no information was vouched
me by any body whom I questioned;
frowns, shrugs, and contemptuous "bahs"
were all the answers I ever received to
my benighted interrogatories. In vain I
sought for rules to guide me at these
Springs. I saw Mr. Robert Rushton, to
whom I was emphatically sold, riding and
dining with creatures whose whole souls
were absorbed in horses, livery, and style,
and I saw him cut, ruthlessly, people
whose whole souls were also absorbed in
horses, livery, and style! Then I saw
Louise petting ladies, and smiling on gentlemen,
who were badly dressed, and disagreeable,
and yet this young lady would
have nothing to do with the so-and-sos,
<i>because</i> they were badly dressed and disagreeable!</p>

<p>It seems that Therese was somewhat
unmanageable too. She only appeared in
the ball-room twice a week, which was a
rule with our party, but then, oh then!
Mr. Robert Rushton was horrified to see
her polking and waltzing with all sorts of
partners. Mrs. Blanton gathered beaux
from all quarters. Every body was doing

<!-- page 261 col 2 -->

her homage. Robert, who had never been
accustomed to this southern freedom of
manner, was shocked and annoyed to
see her polking about with people she
never saw before. He remonstrated with
her, and she would hang her head and be
extremely penitent, and then&mdash;away she
would go in some fierce fellow's arms.</p>

<p>My sister Louise was called very beautiful,
but very haughty. Her admirers
were among the most distinguished men
at the Springs, and no fops of doubtful
genus were admitted into her circle. In
truth, my sister, according to her contract,
held a very high head. She polk! She
slide about zig-zag, with Tom, Dick, and
Harry, while the rabble were forming a
ring and looking on! Horrors! Gentlemen
repented ever offering to take her out
upon any such exhilarating excursions.
She preferred standing aloof, protected
by a cordon of <i>elegantes</i>, from contact
with the herd; looking ever high-born,
and superior, disdaining any air, or grace,
or angular movement, which might mar
the effect of her elegant repose.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blanton, who was an Alabamian,
and who conversed delightfully in French
and Spanish, secured all foreigners, all
those new-fangled, over-done <i>outr&eacute;</i> specimens
who annually invade our staid Virginia,
making her sons and daughters
stare. I need not say that this was not
altogether pleasant to Mr. Blanton or to
Robert. I hope the reader and the rest
of mankind are already aware of what I
am going to tell, viz., that there is no persuading
an elegant, thorough-bred Virginian
to seek for effect, or to strive to
gain the lion's share of public attention.
They are invincible in their propriety.
They are completely incrusted in a kind
of hereditary superiority, and have no
idea that all the world is not perfectly acquainted
with their claims. Consequently,
they will <i>not</i> make themselves ridiculous,
though all the world should strive
to be ridiculous, and though Fashion, who
is most potent in Virginia, should proclaim
it to be her supreme will that all her subjects
should be as ridiculous as possible.
They are, under all circumstances and all
provocations, the most perfect ladies and
gentlemen in the world. The swell mob
can swell, and parvenus can dash about
without being rivalled by a single son or
daughter of the genuine aristocracy of the
Old Dominion. Their regal repose of manner
and high dignity of character is invulnerable.
If other people <i>will</i> be <i>outr&eacute;</i>
and <i>will</i> angle for notoriety, what have
these ladies and gentlemen to do with it?
If a man <i>will</i> wear a remarkable hat, why,
let him wear it. If a lady chooses to haul
her hair back and invade society like a

<!-- page 262 col 1 -->

Chinese, why these ladies and gentlemen
are not responsible. If French people,
itching for notoriety, clear a ring and get
up dancing matches in the dog-days, why
these ladies and gentlemen have no earthly
objection. If ladies, by hard dancing,
and elaborate dressing, and conspicuous
airs, strive to earn a questionable paragraph
in a questionable newspaper, these
ladies and gentlemen are only surprised
at their taste.</p>

<p>I am happy to say that Miss Blanton
left all her jewelry at home. It seems
that she had it all packed and ready for
transportation with the rest of her artillery,
for this famous battle-field, and that
Therese, by a delightful <i>ruse</i>, defrauded
her of it. Miss Blanton was bemoaning
the emerald-eyed serpents, and other rare
and curious specimens, at intervals during
her sojourn at the Springs. Our party
were spared some terrible be-jewelings by
this adroit man&oelig;uvre of Mrs. Blanton's,
and nobody knows how thankful Robert
was for this happy deliverance.</p>

<p>Mr. Blanton walked the gay assemblies
like some unhappy, unknelled ghost. The
water was of no earthly benefit to this
unhappy man; neither were the famous
baths conducive of any good. Still stark
and still stiff, he gulped his morning
draught, and still desperate, he plunged
with frisky fellows up to his very chin in
medicinal waters. Jaundiced man, he
knew not what pleasure, or what comfort
was! Victim of the green-eyed monster,
butt of Cupid, dispeller of all sociability
and ease, Stork in human apparel, terror
and scatterer of Juveniles, wonder and inexhaustible
source of inquiry and solicitude
to all who saw him; silent, speechless,
and stiff he came, and silent, speechless,
and stiff he was likely to go away.</p>

<p>In the course of time Miss Willianna
caught a beau. This was the greatest
feat of the season, and the most remarkable
event I have to chronicle. I say she
<i>caught</i> him, because the man was suddenly
caught up, unsuspicious and unconscious
of danger, much to his own surprise
and much to the surprise of his friends,
and all those who had his interests at
heart. It happened in this wise. That
dissatisfied ghost, Mr. Blanton, while going
his mighty rounds, encountered a
large man, closely resembling a frog, sitting
in a very warm, badly ventilated,
spinster-phalanxed corner. We understand
that when the man in the badly
ventilated, spinster-phalanxed corner saw
Mr. Blanton, who, void of all purpose, and
innocent of all damage, was bearing down
in that direction, he suddenly exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Why, Blanton!"</p>

<p>And that Mr. Blanton, though generally

<!-- page 262 col 2 -->

speechless found utterance in the
words,</p>

<p>"Surely it isn't Dandy!"</p>

<p>"The very man," exclaimed the man in
the corner, sincerely hoping that supernatural
aid had been sent to his relief. After
this, Mr. Blanton shook him warmly by
the hand, rescued him from the phalanx
of spinsters and badly ventilated corner;
and, seeing that the man, thankful for his
deliverance, was likely to follow him on
his nightly rounds, he brought him
straight to me, presented him and walked
off, thinking that he had done a first-rate
thing, and conferred a lasting favor upon
me. Now I, who am, particularly in gay
assemblies, the most taciturn of mortals,
had nothing very cheering to say to Mr.
George Dandy. He, however, seemed
anxious to undertake a conversation, and
turning to me in a conciliatory manner,
remarked that it was</p>

<p>"A very close evening."</p>

<p>"Very," I responded laconically, and
the conversation seemed about to give up
the ghost. Just at this highly interesting
crisis, Miss Blanton, who was perfectly
disengaged, tapped me with her fan, and
smiled so sweetly, that I immediately
presented Mr. George Dandy to her, and
was really happy to see that Miss Blanton
appreciated that interesting conversationist.
Mr. Dandy, supremely happy
to find himself so warmly welcomed, lingered
near Miss Willianna the whole evening.
All I know after this, is, that
Dandy was caught, and very soon found
himself engaged, and was further informed
that he must look forward to matrimony
at no distant day. During all this time,
Mrs. Blanton so worried my brother, and
so tantalized and harassed him, that he
pronounced the Black Mountain Springs a
bore.</p>

<p>Therese was very celebrated at the
South; and Robert, who flattered himself
that he alone had discovered and admired
this jewel of a woman, was pained to
learn that she had been toasted and idolized
at many Southern watering-places,
and what was worse, that Therese revelled
in this admiration. There was no
coquetry ever so beautiful as hers. And
she certainly excelled in the art of retaining
the affections of those fond hearts
which she lacerated at every turn. No
lover could think her wilfully cruel, and
no man of any susceptibility could fail to
be enticed by such an array of charms.
Grave and reverend seigneurs would cluster
around this beautiful, naive, sincere-hearted
woman; men, <i>blas&eacute;</i> and woman
hating, would be attracted by her purity,
freshness, and amiability. Many a sad
heart has she cheered by her woman's

<!-- page 263 col 1 -->

tact and instinctive knowledge, of what
the sad heart required. People overlooked
her coquetry, and were lenient to
her pretty faults, which all leaned so
beautifully to virtue's side. And there
was never a frown upon her open brow,
never a sarcasm on her untiring little
tongue, never a cut for friend or foe, never
a severe retort, never a word of malice or
ill-will; all was harmony and good nature
in her charmed presence, and this fairy
creature floated in an atmosphere of love
and admiration.</p>

<p>Mr. Blanton, who had turned his
back upon all mankind, seemed determined
to let Therese run her course, and
surfeit on flattery and adulation, while he
prowled about a perfect wreck. He
hadn't a word to throw at a dog, as the
saying is. He walked to the spring three
times a day&mdash;he went to his meals when
the bell rang&mdash;he invaded the ball-room
twice a week&mdash;and thus he passed his
time. Robert lost his fine airs and equanimity.
He grew almost morose, and
could have stabbed a certain fairy-limbed
Frenchman with great pleasure. Not a
flirtation had he to amuse himself with;
Therese absorbing his eyes and ears and
innermost thoughts.</p>

<p>In the midst of heart-burnings, and
fancy dances, that enemy to crowds at
watering-places, Jack Frost, appeared.
Every night he nipped belated buds, and
spread himself out upon the green-sward,
and gave people to understand in his way,
that it was time to be off. We bade
farewell to the Black Mountain, and its
health-giving fountain, about the latter
part of September; Miss Blanton having
captured Dandy, Mrs. Blanton having
done great damage, and Mr. Blanton looking
forward to a quiet winter at home,
with some faint feeling of comfort. Robert
and Therese were evidently at logger-heads.
Nothing that little woman could
say at table, or elsewhere, was received
with the least show of interest by my
brother. The yellow <i>bonne</i>, and Adolphe,
failed to entice his rigid eye, and Therese
returned to Mr. Blanton's guardianship,
and was borne home, without a kind look,
or a flattering word from her whilome
adorer.</p>

<!-- page 263 col 2 -->

<p>We returned to dear Fairy Hill, renewed
in health and spirits. Robert was
rather quiet and subdued, and somewhat
given to heavy sighing, solitary rambles,
and reverie. We missed Dashwood more
and more, as the seasons rolled around.
He had been the life of our home circle
so long, that even Grandma declared she
missed Mr. Chatterbox. His place was
ill supplied by Tom Farren, who came in
regularly to tea, and sat erect for hours,
talking about the crops, horizontal ditches,
politics, guano, subsoiling, the convention,
Mr. Webster's speech, the rise in cotton,
the fall in breadstuffs, the prospects for
tobacco, the crevasse, non-intervention, the
new candidate, and the missing steamer.
It was enough to put us all asleep, to
hear Papa and our exemplary neighbor
talking over these profound matters.
Robert, whenever he wrote to Dashwood,
dated from the land of Nod. Alas&mdash;Tom
Farren had none of the easy variableness,
the brilliant flashes of poetry and pathos,
and the inexhaustible humor of his gifted
rivals. He had no songs, no hearty outburts
of laughter, no high-toned chivalry,
no glorious lights and sombre shadows,
no merry twinkle of the eye, no moments
of sadness, no softened melancholy, nothing,
actually nothing, which made our
Dashwood eminent among men, and
charming among women. Did he, correct
Tom Farren, think to woo my delicate
sister with horizontal ditches? Did he
think to soften her by sub-soiling, or to
make her more genial with his eternal
guano? Had Dashwood seen all this, he
would have laughed. He would have out-talked
Tom Farren on horizontal ditches,
and had a sly blink of the eye for Louise
into the bargain.</p>

<p>Louise, to the horror of Grandma, was
deaf and dumb in Mr. Farren's company.
Occasionally, he would make a deferential
remark to her, to which she would deign
a cool monosyllable if she felt inclined.
Sometimes she would see him when he
called, and sometimes she would not.
Sometimes she chose to be a statue, and
sometimes a woman. In all her moods
and tenses though, she was ever respectfully
regarded, and deferentially approached,
by that model man, Mr. Farren.</p>

</div>

<p>DASHWOOD had been absent about
eighteen months, and not one line
had been received from him. He had
said before he left that he would not
write until he had good news to tell us;
and we, therefore, concluded our brilliant
luminary was waning beyond the sea.
Alas, there are so few that fulfil the promise
of their youth! Genius, though
divine, is easily turned astray. Who has
not seen it very low&mdash;sinking into a dishonored
grave?</p>

<p>Poor Dashwood, more gifted than
others, was therefore more tempted than

<!-- page 416 col 2 -->

others. Men are not sought, who are
not worth seeking. He, unfortunately so
versatile, so pliant, so easily accommodating
himself to all characters, was attractive
to all. His company was ever
welcome. No assembly was complete
without him. His time was never his
own. Gay, idle fellows were constantly
seeking him, and seductive ladies ready
to flatter him. Too gifted, too fond of
pleasure, too enthusiastic, he was beset
on all sides by allurements which few
withstand. He had but to woo to win;
but to smile, to please; but to exert himself
in the least, and rounds of applause
saluted him. Spoilt by adulation, tired
of flattery, blas&eacute;, and dissatisfied, he had

<!-- page 417 col 1 -->

forsaken quiet, quaint, easy-going Old
Virginia, to seek solitude and repose in
Paris.</p>

<p>To execute wise resolves in Paris!
Flying from the temptations and pleasures
of the world to Paris! I feared that he
was lost. I feared that he who had
yielded in Virginia, could hardly escape
in Paris. I feared that he was ashamed
to write. Robert began to grow restless
at his long silence, Louise painfully silent,
uncle Joe fidgety, and Mrs. Barbara
exultant. The man at the post-office
saw no peace for uncle Joe, who was
distracted for a letter. On fair, unrheumatic
days, he would ride over to our
house, ask for Louise, look earnestly at
her, kiss her, and then pace off upon his
easy-going animal, in a low, sad state.</p>

<p>Mamma's eyes followed Louise, and
marked the shadow on her clear pale
brow. There were cares and troubles in
this world, from which no mother's love
could shield her. And though fair, and
beautiful, and beloved, she was yet mortal
and must suffer. Papa, too, felt that his
regal, petted child was enduring silently
and uncomplainingly. His heart yearned
for her. Dashwood's name was seldom
mentioned. Tom Farren came and went
daily, and the imperious object of his adoration
never turned her eye upon him.
Cold and fair as ice, and unapproachable
in her grief, she brooked no compassion
from those whose hearts were bleeding
for her. Too proud to acknowledge her
weakness, too haughty to heed our sympathy,
she held aloof from us, impregnable
in the sanctity of her sorrow. Papa,
who had never harshly reproved her in
his life, longed to speak with her. He
felt it his duty, however painful it might
be to him, to remonstrate seriously with
her on her stern obstinacy and unswerving
constancy to one he deemed so unworthy.</p>

<p>"My daughter," said papa gently to
her, "I have suffered for you more than
you are aware of. I have endeavored to
convince you that your happiness is all I
ask. I tremble for you, my dear, when
I see you rejecting all advice, and throwing
away all happiness, for a man whose
wonderful gifts only unfit him for usefulness
in life."</p>

<p>"Papa," said Louise, unmoved, "we
will not talk about this, if you please."</p>

<p>"But, Louise, I must; I am in duty
bound to advise and direct you. I must
show you the right, when I see you so
perverse, and so wilfully blind."</p>

<p>"Not so blind as you think, papa."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Not so blind, that I cannot see faults
in the most gifted. Not so blind, that I
cannot see the dangers you would point

<!-- page 417 col 2 -->

out to me. Not so perverse, that I wilfully
shut my eyes to the truth. Believe
me, I have suffered too; and your daughter,
sir, knows her duty to you, and also
to herself."</p>

<p>"Your duty to me is to heed my counsels,
and obey my voice."</p>

<p>"Both of which I shall ever proudly
do, sir, when conscientiously I can."</p>

<p>"Very well, my dear, go your way,
but when you bring trouble upon yourself,
and all who love you, do not look to
me."</p>

<p>"I will never bring you trouble, sir, or
cause you one moment's unhappiness, by
any folly or waywardness on my part."</p>

<p>"Louise!"</p>

<p>"I shall never forget," said Louise,
proudly, "the high dignity which I inherit.
I shall never forget my duty; I
shall never forget that I am your daughter,
sir."</p>

<p>"Then go, my child. Go, shielded by
your own pride and high sense of the
right. I place all faith and confidence in
you. Go, Louise, as free, my girl, as you
have ever been. No longer will I doubt
you, my own noble child. I am secure,
for I rely upon your own moral strength,
and your respect for yourself."</p>

<p>"And on my love for you, papa," said
Louise, with moist eyes.</p>

<p>"God bless you, child of my heart.
Remember&mdash;I say no more. But all
faith and all confidence I repose in you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, papa; you have made
me proud and happy from this hour."</p>

<p>Thus wisely papa dealt with his favored
child. She was left to herself to do
that which seemed right unto her. This
was the only way to guide the spoiled,
imperious beauty. Feeling her own dignity,
proud of her strength and of the
confidence reposed in her, she would have
died before she would have compromised
the one or betrayed the other. But, under
all this, lay the woman's faithful
heart&mdash;hoping, praying, trusting.</p>

<p>She believed him true; she believed
him great and good. Had he been other
than this; had he lost, by any misconduct,
the high place he had gained in
her estimation, or forfeited the apotheosis
with which she had endowed him, the
spell would have been broken at once.
Her love, high, and pure, and spiritual as
it was, would have fallen with him.
Founded on respect, it would have tottered
with its base. Founded on respect,
it must be retained by respect. He must
be worthy of her love, and continue worthy
of her love, or he was lost, and the
beautiful creation of her heart shattered
for ever. I trembled for Dashwood. I
trembled for Louise, I knew his easy,

<!-- page 418 col 1 -->

pliant disposition, and I knew her stern,
unyielding pride. I knew her heroic capability
of endurance, her high sense of
propriety, and I feared the result. For
my own part, I had always been in favor
of Dashwood, but, like uncle Joe, I almost
feared to avow my predilection. That
good man almost betrayed himself daily.
When Mesdames Barbara and Ph&oelig;be
would be railing against his favorite, his
contortions of visage were ludicrous in
the extreme. Sometimes, he would limp
about the room, and whistle, to moderate
himself. Then, he would smoke furiously,
and thus let off an enormous amount of
steam. Again, he would handle his
crutch in a manner which convinced me
that he was almost tempted to do something
very rash indeed. He lost no opportunity
to pet and fondle Louise, and
to drop a sly word for her ear in praise
of his favorite. He resorted to various
expedients to amuse her in her trouble,
and wooden punch-bowls, ladles, baskets
neatly cut of cherry-stones, and hearts
fantastically fashioned from the same&mdash;all
the handiwork of that once rash man,
were presented to her. Tales of his youth
were conjured up and remodelled, and revarnished,
to beguile her ear. All the
particulars of his love scrape with the
broken-hearted young lady, who sought
the southern breezes, were, for the first
time, confessed by uncle Joe, in order
triumphantly to prove that absence could
not conquer love.</p>

<p>My valiant brother was not idle during
Dashwood's appalling and inexplicable
silence. He was voluble and argumentative,
and made a speech for his friend
every day at table. A rumor reached us
that some publishing house had, rather
pompously, announced a book of poems
as about to appear, which, some persons
hinted, were from Dashwood's pen. Mr.
Farren mentioned the rumor at dinner one
day, and said he presumed it was true.</p>

<p>"Not <i>our</i> Dashwood, surely," said Mrs.
Barbara, rather pointedly.</p>

<p>"And why not <i>our</i> Dashwood?" exclaimed
Robert, wheeling around as
though about to charge the most implacable
enemy he had in the world. "Show
me a man more capable of writing than
he. On whom has nature so lavished her
gifts? Where is a better heart, or a more
godlike man?"</p>

<p>"My son, you always run away with
that subject," said mamma gently.</p>

<p>"I acknowledge that I am not myself
when Dashwood is remotely slandered.
I acknowledge that I am incensed against
those persons who cannot excuse one fault
in a fellow-creature. Suppose I were eminently
handsome, would I not be at times

<!-- page 418 col 2 -->

proud of my person? Certainly I would,
and so would all of us. Suppose I excelled
in dancing, would I not delight to
dance? Suppose all the world sought
me, and applauded me, would I not seek
the world? Suppose I had a talent for
music, drawing, oratory, conversation, poetry,
satire, polite learning, and were of
an enthusiastic, ambitious temperament,
would I not exult in exhibiting my gifts?
Would I not turn from one to the other,
uncertain which to prefer? Would I not
delight to astonish with my brilliancy
and versatility? Surely I would, and so
would every one of us. It is very easy
to say we would not do thus and so, until
we are tempted. It is easy for the poor
to rail against the rich; but let the wheel
of fortune turn, and the question alters.
It is easy for a lady to say she will not
marry, until she has a beau; then she
begs to change her mind. An ill-used
servant makes the worst master. Nobody
knows how he would act until he is
tried, and then he is often astonished at
himself."</p>

<p>"You had better have a temporary pulpit
erected," said Mrs. Barbara, "before
proceeding further with your sermon."</p>

<p>"I am obliged to you, madam," said
Robert, sarcastically; "but I should think
such a piece of furniture a necessary permanency
in any house you honored with
your presence."</p>

<p>"Robert!" said papa gravely, while a
smile went around the festive board.</p>

<p>"You had better say champagne," cried
Mrs. Barbara.</p>

<p>"No!" cried Robert, "better still to
remark calmly and dispassionately, that
evil communications will corrupt the best
manners."</p>

<p>"And pray, do not forget, in summing
up your brilliant apothegms, that you can't
squeeze blood out of a turnip; neither
does any reasonable person expect to make
a silk purse out of a sow's ear," retorted
the dowager.</p>

<p>"Most remarkable and irrefragable
truths, madam. Allow me&mdash;&mdash;" said
my brother, raising his glass respectfully,
and bowing gravely to the heroine of the
theatrical conflagration. The stately heroine
tipped her glass at him, and during
this ludicrous ceremony we all laughed.
Even Mr. Farren's risibles were excited.</p>

<p>The grandmamma and grandson were
remotely alike. They had hot heads and
nimble tongues, and were often sparring
at each other in this way; indeed, they
had never been known to agree on any
subject.</p>

<p>It really seemed that my brother's temper
was visibly changing. He, who had
always been so gay and facetious, so fond

<!-- page 419 col 1 -->

of jokes and so careless of the morrow,
was now morose at times, and, like grandma,
seemed in a state of perpetual warfare
with all mankind. His favorite pursuits
had lost their charms. His horses,
fat and sleek, were no longer exercised
and trained. His dogs, when they came
jumping and frisking around him, were
sternly rebuked. Even Byron's harmonious
despair no longer diverted him, or
soothed his captious mind. His whole
soul was absorbed in Dashwood, Louise,
and Therese. The cruelty and coquetry
of the fair Alabamian had well-nigh
brought on a typhoid fever. Still time
passed on, and still Dashwood remained
silent, and Therese cruel.</p>

<p>Just about the time my brother's
spirits were as low as they could be, and
just before uncle Joe had fully made up
his mind to be very rash indeed, Robert
returned from the post-office with a very
bright face, rushed into mamma's room,
slammed the door, and then held up two
letters, and fairly danced around the room.
My brother was himself again, important,
mysterious, tantalizing, and somewhat inclined
to talk.</p>

<p>"Remember," he cried, "it never rains
but it pours. Bear that in mind, girls,
before I can give you the news."</p>

<p>"My son, what is the use of tantalizing
people so?" said mamma.</p>

<p>"Well, prepare yourselves. Are you
ready? No fainting now, no hysterics;
and with your permission I will read letter
number one."</p>

<p>"Pray, take your time," said Louise,
coolly; "you seem nearer hysterics than
any one else, I think."</p>

<p>"You are right; perhaps to-morrow
will do as well."</p>

<p>"Provided Mr. Robert Rushton does
not explode," said Louise, laughing.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!&mdash;no, upon my word, I must
out with it. To begin with Dashwood&mdash;God
bless him; here is his veritable old
fist once more. First he writes that in
London he advertised for his great-aunt,
Miss Ellen McGregor Dashwood (which
was exactly what I advised him to do),
and that, sure enough, the old lady responded
from away in Kent, and invited
the bold advertiser to hunt her up in that
direction. Accordingly, Dashwood started
off to Kent, and found the old lady,
who, fortunately, notwithstanding tabby
cats, and pink-eyed dogs, had yet a warm,
snug place in her heart for him. Here he
remained, treated like a prince, for a
month, the old lady growing fonder of
him every day. Finally, she begged him
to resign his office, and live with her;
'but,' says Dashwood, 'though strongly
inclined to consent, yet remembering uncle

<!-- page 419 col 2 -->

Joe's predictions, viz., that, if our government
thought to attach <i>me</i> to any point
of the compass, our government was
vastly mistaken, I respectfully declined.
Still the old lady urged me daily, and still
I would not consent. She offered me a
thousand pounds per annum, and though
my pockets were as light as feathers, I
again, to my immortal honor, declined.
Still the old lady held on to me with
might and main, and I finally tore myself
away, promising to see her again.
The next week found me in Paris, engaged
in my official duties&mdash;mem&mdash;tell uncle
Joe to cut a notch for me there. In the
midst of my avocations, and at the height
of the carnival, I was attacked with a
brain fever, which nearly finished me. I
was the sickest man in the world. To lie
all day long upon a small bed, with French
gabbling around you in every direction,
while your brain is whirling and reeling,
is enough to drive any reasonable person
mad. I had foreign nurses, foreign doctors,
the oddest potions to take, the greenest
attendants, was civilly requested to do
the strangest things, and politely harassed
within an inch of my life, until I concluded
that I had rather die then and there,
and break off in the middle of my life, as
it were, without waiting for the sequel of
so perplexing a tragedy. Thus I lay for
six weeks, and finally arose from my sick
bed to find my purse in a very low state;
indeed, I may say completely collapsed.
Fortunately, I had a package of letters
from my guardian angel in Kent, in which
she had inclosed a draft. This I kept by
me for some weeks in case of accidents,
but finally had the good fortune to return
it to her untouched. Again the dear
old lady wrote me, advising me to go to
Italy for my health, and for her sake to
resign my office. She was particularly
anxious that I should go, she said; she
would defray all expenses, and go I must.
In a very feeble and dilapidated condition,
I tendered my resignation, which was
graciously accepted by the department,
and behold me next <i>en route</i> for Italy.</p>

<p>" 'You remember, my beloved Robert,
how I vowed to forget the muses; how
I railed against those inconstant ladies,
who have led so many lovers astray;
how I determined to turn my back upon
them, and, indeed, had quite cut their acquaintance
before I left old Virginia's
shore. And you know I left my native
land with a head brimful of common
sense. Every poetical avenue was jealously
closed, every crack in my brain
rigidly guarded. I was determined that
nothing, however poetical, should mislead
me. No landscape, no water view, no
love of home (the most poetical feeling in

<!-- page 420 col 1 -->

the world) should woo me back to my
old habits. Right bravely I battled
against these nine ladies&mdash;God forgive
them&mdash;until I found myself convalescing,
drinking in new life beneath the
glorious skies of Italy. Italy, steeped to
the very heaven in poetry! Here the old
feelings were stirred up; here the old
dreams came back; here fairy land was
opened; here I yielded, knowing that the
nine ladies had me upon their own ground,
and they seized me. Behold, I dreamed
again&mdash;I was intoxicated&mdash;I was expanded&mdash;I
was lifted up&mdash;I staggered beneath
the weight of so much poetry! Poesy
sailed on the deep blue air, and glided on
every stately panorama of this magnificent
land. Still my MSS. remained untouched
in the bottom of my box. Oh!
I thirsted for these MSS. I felt like an
old toper deprived of his drink. I was
pining for my manuscripts. Sickness had
cleared me, had refined me, had purified
me for this. I paced my room. I was
full of thoughts. Something was heavy
upon me. It was my undigested poetry.
I seized the pen. I dashed, I scampered,
I revelled in the blissful regions of imagination.
I was pressed on by thought,
rushing, coming, accumulating thought.
I wrote on all day and all night. Quick
my glad pen winged its way across the
snowy page. The wee small hours found
me drunk with poetry. During this paroxysm,
which I have but feebly described,
I finished off that unfortunate manuscript
which has so long been my <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i>.
After this, when the reaction had taken
place, and the sober second thought came
upon me, I wrote a long letter to my dear
aunt Ellen, in which I made a full confession,
and sent her the manuscript, requesting
her to do with it as she chose.
She chose to submit it to the inspection
of the most high-minded and generous
<i>litterateur</i> in England, and to return me
ten thousand thanks for the gift. She
wrote me, further, that she had made inquiries
concerning me of a friend in Virginia,
and that this friend had advised her
of my poetical predilections, and had
given so flattering an account of me, (!)
my standing in society, (!!) my talents,
and all that (worse and worse), that she
was thereby induced to insist upon my
travelling at least twelve months, and
hoped some day to see me reaping the
honors I so richly deserved. My dear
Robert, excuse this egotism. Do you
know, that when I received that dear letter
from my aunt&mdash;when I thus became
convinced that I actually had a friend in
the world, who took a deep and abiding
interest in me, I knelt beside the open
window, and looking up to the rose-tinted

<!-- page 420 col 2 -->

sky above me, prayed fervently and
long. I was thankful, I was humble, I
was a better man. Never had the deep
waters of my heart been so moved. Now,
Robert, who was this friend in Virginia,
who induced my aunt to act so generously
towards me? To whom am I indebted
for all the benefits she has showered upon
me?'</p>

<p>"Does any body know?" inquired
Robert.</p>

<p>"I suspect it was Jenny," said Louise,
her face lighting up.</p>

<p>"And why do you suspect me?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"She looks guilty. Bravo! sly-boots!"
cried Robert, catching me in his arms, and
caressing me violently.</p>

<p>I had to confess it all. I confessed that
Miss Dashwood had done me the honor
to write me a few months after Dashwood's
departure&mdash;while he was her guest,
in fact&mdash;and that she inquired strictly
and confidentially of me concerning him.
That I immediately returned her an answer,
so highly satisfactory, that the good
lady was charmed. That I had received
a second letter from her, in which she
spoke most affectionately of her nephew,
thanked me for the information I had
given her, and said she would act accordingly.
How nobly she had performed her
part, I had learned, for the first time,
from Dashwood's letter.</p>

<p>"My dear, dear Jenny!" cried Louise,
with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Angel of mercy!" cried Robert,
catching me again to his heart. And I
had to submit to some of the most unmerciful
hugs, and remorseless squeezes,
that ever fell to mortal lot; Robert clearly
forgetting that I was flesh and blood,
and going on with me as one would expect
an anaconda to proceed with a delicious
ox.</p>

<p>But my brother had yet something in
reserve for us. His looks were fraught
with meaning. He stepped into the hall,
and returned with rather a large package,
which he handed to me. They clustered
around me while I opened it. It was
Dashwood's book of poems, with Miss
Ellen McGregor Dashwood's compliments!
She had had it published in London, and
edited by the distinguished <i>litterateur</i> to
whose inspection she submitted the manuscript.
A magnificent volume it was,
most beautifully and elaborately illustrated.
The frontispiece was a superb specimen
of the engraver's art. A youth, remotely
resembling Dashwood, sat leaning
against a rock in a sombre valley. On
the sun-tipped hills around him, tripped
the tuneful nine, weaving wreaths for
him, beckoning him up the airy peaks,

<!-- page 421 col 1 -->

pointing to the burnished hill-tops, and to
the laurel crown on high, while one beam
from the glowing heavens pierced the valley,
and illuminated the rippling, careless
locks of the dreaming poet.</p>

<p>Gems of the mind lay enshrined in this
magnificent casket. Bursts of inspiration,
and mellow harmonies were linked in
musical rhyme. Light cadences, mingled
with gigantic thoughts, which loomed into
eternity. Echoes from the heart, reverberations
from spirit-land, music of the
spheres, revealings of wonder-land, liftings
of the spirit, longings of the soul, murmurs
from the far-off shores, and light-hearted
songs of earth, floated on, in
sweetest melody, and mingled in one harmonious
whole.</p>

<p>"Read, Jenny, read," said Robert, leaning
back upon the cushions of his chair;
"I want a tone from his grand, deep
heart." I turned the leaves listlessly,
and read:</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Sweeping, sweeping ever o'er me,<br/>

Like spirit-murmurs from afar,<br/>

Rising phantom-like before me,<br/>

Sprinkling light, as from a star;</p>

<p>Buoying up on ocean billow,<br/>

Light bounding on the summer air,<br/>

Lulling oft on weary pillow,<br/>

Thy memory cometh, ever fair&mdash;</p>

<p>Cometh like a bubbling fountain<br/>

Up-springing in the desert sand,<br/>

Gurgling as from parent mountain,<br/>

And sparkling as in happier land.</p>

<p>Falling like the tinkling water,<br/>

Enhaloed like the evening star,<br/>

Tripping, as though fairy taught her,<br/>

Sweet memory cometh from afar.</p>

<p>Tripping as to lightest numbers,<br/>

Stealing near in saddened hours,<br/>

Weaving through delicious slumbers<br/>

Dreams of home and summer bowers.</p>

</div>

<p>"Ah, that is very sweet," said mamma,
imprinting a kiss upon the softly glowing
cheek of the poet's beloved.</p>

<p>"There we have Dashwood! he speaks
in every line you have read," said Robert;
"may God bless him, and prosper him,
and prove through him, that to love the
things He has made, is but to love Him."</p>

<p>"My son," said mamma, "you are going
too far, both Dashwood and yourself.
When you have learned the frailty and
insecurity of earth, you will turn from the
fleeting things He has made to Him."</p>

<p>"Still, mamma, it is not right to scowl
upon the earth. I detest those persons
who are continually railing against all
earthly pleasures. Believe me, we are
made for the world, and the world for us.
It is folly for us to be fitting ourselves
for a place of which we know nothing,
and thereby unfitting ourselves for the
very pleasant and delightful abode He,
in His wisdom, has given us. Now
we are of the earth, earthy; when we
shall have put on immortality, we shall

<!-- page 421 col 2 -->

be clad and fashioned for eternity. In the
mean time, it is religion, religion of the
highest order, to be contented and happy
here, and not to turn with contempt from
the beauties and pleasures by which He
has graciously surrounded us. For my
own part, my motto is, <i>dum vivimus
vivamus</i>, and, I may say, it is also my
religion."</p>

<p>"But years gradually change us&mdash;sorrows
cause us to turn away from earth.
The heart points elsewhere. Instinctively
we reach up until we find a better place,"
said mamma, sadly.</p>

<p>"I know, I know," said Robert, putting
his arm around her. "There are some,
even here, who are more of heaven than
of earth. There are scattered, here and
there, gentle spirits to lead us on. There
are some, whom to follow, is but to go to
the home from which they have been sent
to guide us."</p>

<p>"May you follow one of these!" said
mamma.</p>

<p>"I have two of them to follow," said
Robert, "two who go unconsciously together;
two whose hearts direct them
ever aright; two angels with hidden
wings, who beck me beautifully on. They
are&mdash;my mother and Therese!"</p>

<p>"Therese!" cried Louise and I.</p>

<p>"Yes, Therese&mdash;gay, dashing, coquettish,
heart-breaking Therese. She is ever
coyly fluttering in the right path! She,
with her giddy, chameleon-like nature,
is obeying her good, true heart, and coming
into measures at last!" and Robert drew
from his vest pocket a little perfumed
billet, which any physiognomist would
have said could only be written by Therese.
He said he would read a few choice extracts
from this precious document, as a
particular favor to mamma, Louise, and
me. From these extracts, selected with
great care by Robert, we gathered that
Therese was in trouble. She wrote a
doleful, <i>na&iuml;ve</i> letter, in which she said
she wanted to take back every thing she
had ever said, or written, which could
possibly give dear Mr. Rushton any pain.
She said somebody (Mr. Blanton, Robert
informed us) had treated her very unkindly&mdash;that
she was almost as much afraid
of him as his own badly used dog&mdash;that
she wanted to go away from his house&mdash;and
here she appealed so beautifully and
artlessly to her lover, that Robert had
actually to seize us all, and kiss us, before
he could proceed any further.</p>

<p>After this delightful ceremony, he returned
to the delicious little letter, wherein
Therese went on to say, that Mr. Blanton
had gotten angry with her about something.
She could not tell, to save her life,
she said, what had happened to put him

<!-- page 422 col 1 -->

so terribly out. At all events, he had
scolded her savagely, and then he whipped
Adolphe; beat him, oh! dreadfully, regardless
of his mother's tears and entreaties,
because the dear little fellow had innocently
walked upon one of his angular,
ugly flower-beds.</p>

<p>Of course, my brother rushed chivalrously
to the rescue of his Dulcinea.
Mr. Robert Rushton could neither eat nor
sleep, so impatient was he to go where
duty called him. Sappingwood had hardly
time to sleek up the ponies, varnish his
own immaculate boots, or trim his moustache,
before Robert was equipped for immediate
departure.</p>

<p>Grandma, with her head out of the
window, squeaked out in vain to know
where he was going. My brother kissed
his hand to her, and dashed along the
bending road, with glittering wheels, and
bounding heart. Papa stepped out upon
the balcony, and smiled, and waved his
adieu to this gallant knight of modern
times.</p>

<p>When my brother asked for Therese at
Mr. Blanton's inhospitable door, he was
informed that she had denied herself to
all visitors for some days. Robert gave
his card to the man, and then a side-door
was opened, and Therese came running to
him with glowing cheeks, and moistened
eyes. My brother drew her proudly to
him; she blushed, and clung to his arm;
and then dropping her lids, she asked "if
light words could part them now;" and
showed him into her own fairy sitting-room.
Here Robert took her to his
bosom, and she burst into tears, with her
head upon his shoulder. Robert declared
to me, in confidence, that at that moment
he not only felt three feet taller, but he
felt like a giant&mdash;a very happy, illustrious,
all-conquering giant, intent upon the blood
of an Englishman (Blanton). Adolphe
came in, looking shy, but pleased, and
very soon began to cling to Robert too.</p>

<p>No dear little exuberant coquette was
ever more completely subdued than was
Therese by Blanton's barbarity. All the
world had smiled upon this little woman,
for she had smiled upon all the world.
Nobody could have the cruelty to wound
her, for she was always so delicate and
kind. She was not only made for summer
weather, but she carried summer
sunshine ever in her bosom. Her presence
was ever cheering, and her little failings
were so womanly, so clearly descending
from pure goodness of heart, that they
only made her more lovable. To see
her taking with her into a ball-room all
her natural purity and amiability, and
thereby gaining universal homage&mdash;to see
her with the great, as she was with the

<!-- page 422 col 2 -->

small&mdash;to see her bestowing the same
beaming smile upon all mankind&mdash;was to
remind one of the goodness of Heaven,
sending its sunshine and its showers upon
the just and upon the unjust.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p class="small">"OF SUCH IS THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN."</p>

</div>

<p>My brother found the Blantons full of
crooks and oddities. Mr. Blanton was as
particular as an old maid, and the queerest
creature imaginable. He delighted in
rare flower-beds, and pets of all kinds.
He had any number of remarkable dogs,
a raccoon for a bosom companion, and
quite a menagerie of uncouth animals in
subjection.</p>

<p>He was a stern disciplinarian in his
household&mdash;a hard master, and at all
times peevish and exacting. He was made
up of notions, <i>his</i> notions, to which every
body must bend. Therese, with her artless
manner and perfect freedom, found
herself somewhat trammelled here. Even
<i>her</i> fascination could not overcome one of
Mr. Blanton's established notions. Poor
Adolphe was a tender-hearted little fellow,
clinging to any body who was kind to
him, and was very much spoiled by his
mamma.</p>

<p>Mr. Blanton had often remonstrated
with Therese about what he considered
her over-indulgence of her son, and had
indeed undertaken to manage him himself.
But the little fellow had walked
upon one of Mr. Blanton's flower-beds,
and he had beaten him severely. This
was enough for Therese. She, upon, the
strength of this beating, informed Mr.
Blanton that she wouldn't marry him if
he were strung with diamonds from his
head to his heels.</p>

<p>Nobody should whip Adolphe; nobody
should take that liberty with <i>her</i> son, if
he trampled all the flower-beds in the
universe.</p>

<p>From all accounts, little Therese was
up in arms about the matter, but had become
somewhat subdued when Robert
reached the Grove, as Mr. Blanton's residence
was called.</p>

<p>"And where is your enemy?" Robert
inquired, after listening for at least half
an hour to Therese's lamentable story.
"Fortunately," said Therese, gravely,
"he is being paid by Providence for his
ungentlemanly conduct. No sooner had
he beat my son than a whole row of discontented
and enraged teeth commenced
aching, and they have been aching ever
since. The last I saw of him, he was
stalking about his grounds, with his face
bound up, grunting piteously."</p>

<!-- page 423 col 1 -->

<p>"Then I needn't run him through with
my sword?" said Robert.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;I would have something done
to him to make him know better. The idea&mdash;the
bare idea of his whipping my little son!
<i>He</i> to take my little fatherless boy, in his
own house, and beat him until his little
neck and arms were purple, and swollen
in great streaks, and the tears running
down his cheeks! If I had been a man&mdash;oh!
if I had only been a man&mdash;I would
have killed him on the spot, the monster!
the brute!"</p>

<p>And my brother informed us that at
these words Therese doubled her dimpled
fists, and looked daggers at the window
overlooking Mr. Blanton's flower-beds.
Nobody ever knew or heard of her being
as angry as she was on this occasion.
She blazed away, and talked like a hero.
Robert said she was fire and tow. She
declared she would not stay in Mr. Blanton's
house. He might beat her. He
had assurance enough to beat her, she
really thought. During this happy interview,
Mr. Blanton entered, bringing a
rueful, peaked face, bound up in a red
bandanna. He drew a chair&mdash;and Therese
took Adolphe by the hand, and with a
scornful, indignant air, walked off to the
window, and stood thrumming away upon
the window-pane.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Blanton," remarked the trainer of
youth to Robert, "is highly offended with
me, Mr. Rushton&mdash;and in justice to myself
I must beg that you will listen to a few
words on <i>my</i> side of the question."</p>

<p>"Really I must decline the honor, sir,"
said Robert, stiffly.</p>

<p>"But I insist&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," said Robert, "I have neither the
right nor inclination to interfere in your
affairs, sir. I regret the unfortunate occurrence,
and will bear your apologies to
the&mdash;Mrs. Blanton, sir, if you desire it."</p>

<p>"She should apologize to <i>me</i>, sir!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Robert.</p>

<p>"I repeat it, sir&mdash;Mrs. Blanton owes me
an apology for her behavior to me this
morning. She has insulted me, sir, in my
own house. She has been managing this
boy of hers, sir, until he has gotten beyond
all control. She insists upon indulging
him and spoiling him, until really I am
obliged to interfere. She is very young,
and very volatile, and very foolish, and
what can <i>she</i> know about managing a
son?"</p>

<p>"She has had at least as much experience
as either of us," said Robert,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Still, sir, she knows nothing in the
world about it. One must have firmness
to manage children. One must be systematic,
and lay down rules for them which

<!-- page 423 col 2 -->

they should not be permitted, on any account,
to break. Adolphe knew it was
wrong to go on that flower-bed; I had
told him so repeatedly. He knew very
well it was wrong, and yet, when he
thought I was out of sight he viciously
galloped backwards and forwards on it,
kicking and neighing like a horse."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Robert, bowing gravely.</p>

<p>"He is an obstinate, wilful boy, and will
give any person trouble who has the
management of him."</p>

<p>Robert had civility enough to give an
"ah!" at this clause.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Mr. Rushton," cried Adolphe,
who had been deeply interested in
Mr. Blanton's account of his unruly proceedings,
"I galloped over those flowers
for fun!"</p>

<p>Blanton scowled, and the little fellow
drew near to my brother, laid his hand
upon his knee, and with an animated face,
continued; "I saw them all growing upon
that bed so high, and John betted me I
couldn't jump clear over the heads of the
flowers, and I betted him two allys I
could, and so I swung my arms just so, a
long time, till I thought I could jump over,
and when John said three, I jumped, and
fell right into the middle, and rolled over
and over upon them all, and when uncle
saw me I was galloping away, like a race-horse."</p>

<p>Robert said the little fellow's countenance
was beautiful as he stood at his
knee, looking up to him, and telling him
exactly how it was. "And did he tell
you this, and you whipped him?" said
Robert, lifting Adolphe upon his knee.</p>

<p>"I would hear nothing he had to say.
He disobeyed my orders and that was
enough."</p>

<p>"Will you excuse me for saying that I
think you should have listened to his explanation?"</p>

<p>Therese had now drawn near them, and
sat down close by Robert. The youthful
mother laid the little boy's cheek upon her
own, and the tears filled her gentle eyes.
Blanton, harsh and rigid as he was, was
moved by these tears. He said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Therese, I promised my brother on his
dying bed to guard this boy&mdash;to instruct
him, and correct him, as I would my own.
I promised that your over-indulgence and
childish fondness should not spoil him,
and I am trying, through all opposition
and misunderstanding, to keep my word."</p>

<p>"But, brother, you whipped him&mdash;you
beat my boy! I heard his screams, and
his trembling voice pleading for mercy,
and I was not allowed to go near him; my
boy&mdash;my fatherless boy&mdash;was cruelly
beaten! Oh, Mr. Rushton, my heart
bleeds when I think of this! I would

<!-- page 424 col 1 -->

have given the last dollar I had in the
world, to have spared him those stripes!
Oh, brother, if this be your guarding, your
promised watching, spare me, oh spare me
the agony of such as this! No, sir!" she
cried, raising her head defiantly, "nobody
under heaven shall correct my son in that
way. My son has a heart, sir, a noble
generous heart, quick and sensitive, with
intelligence to understand any reasoning
<i>you</i> can employ; and this boy, this pride
of my heart, shall never, no never, be
beaten with stripes!"</p>

<p>Therese was beautiful with the fresh
tears on her cheeks, and her moist flashing
eye. There was actually a glory and
sublimity about her as she spoke. Robert
said that he had an almost uncontrollable
impulse to snatch these two treasures in
his arms, and fly off with them as bold as
an eagle. Therese had never shone out
so clearly and splendidly as through these
gem-like tears.</p>

<p>"Very well, madam," said Mr. Blanton,
"I have my duty to perform, and I <i>will</i>
do what I think is right."</p>

<p>"You may do as you please, sir, with
your dogs, or your crow, or your Egyptian
hens, or your opossum, or your raccoon,"
said Therese, running over Mr.
Blanton's private menagerie, "but <i>my</i>
son, sir, you can touch again if you
dare!"</p>

<p>Here Robert felt very awkward, and he
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"It seems that you both have the little
boy's good at heart; I am sure he will not
require correcting again. I say, Adolphe,
will you ever run over your uncle's flowers
again, exactly like a race-horse?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; but I am going with you and
Sap home."</p>

<p>"And leave your mamma?" said
Robert.</p>

<p>"Uncle does not whip mamma. He
loves mamma, and sometimes he tries to
hug and kiss her&mdash;don't he, mamma?"</p>

<p>Adolphe was getting on forbidden ground
again, and Robert said that really there
seemed to be nothing but flower-beds for
that dear boy. This was all we learned
of the conversation. Robert came home
sad, and yet happy. He had patched up
matters as well as he could at the Grove;
and had taken that favorable opportunity
to make quite a comfortable arrangement
for himself. My brother seemed to have
grown older after this. He was not so
frivolous, and light-hearted. He was more
tender and thoughtful. He was uneasy
about his darling Therese. He feared the
petted woman on whom the world had
delighted to smile, had rather an unpleasant
home. He feared Blanton's harshness
might tarnish the fair picture on

<!-- page 424 col 2 -->

which he so loved to dwell; that his
stern discipline might cloud the serene
brow, and dispel the freshness and artlessness
of this fairy-like creature. He
loved her for her faults, her very fickleness,
her lightness, and her simplicity of heart.
He would not have had that lion-lunged
man to meddle with these fragile beauties
and mar them, for worlds. Therefore, my
brother was thoughtful. In the long summer
days, he dreamed, and revelled in castles
shining bright, and crystal-like, in
the clear blue air. He was enveloped in
love and poesy, his kind heart was overflowing
with tenderness and joy. Mamma's
heart was with her boy. And there
was no more beautiful sight under heaven
than the patient mother, sitting with his
head upon her lap, in the long warm days,
running her slender fingers through the
chestnut curls she had loved and trained
from babyhood, and listening to his plans,
and his hopes, and his fears, as he told
them still to her.</p>

<p>In a few weeks Robert had another letter
from Therese, informing him that
Adolphe was sick, and that she was very
unhappy. My brother determined to go
again to Therese, and this time he took
me with him.</p>

<p>After a pleasant morning's drive, we
reached the Grove, and were shown to a
quiet room, where we found Therese sitting
by a low bed, on which Adolphe,
with flushed cheek and glittering eye was
lying.</p>

<p>When she saw us, she covered her face
and wept. Miss Blanton spoke very kindly
to her, and Mr. Blanton looked sorrowful
and troubled.</p>

<p>"My darling," said Therese, bending
over the bed and caressing his little hand,
"here are Mr. Rushton, and dear Miss
Rushton, whom you love so much."</p>

<p>But the bright glittering eye was unchanged,
and no intelligent glance returned
the fond mother's appealing look.
Again Therese covered her face and sobbed.
Mr. Blanton led her gently away
from the bedside, and placing her on a
lounge, whispered a few words, but they
could not comfort poor Therese.</p>

<p>I took the mother's place beside the
little boy, and cooled his burning brow,
and rubbed his little hands. Poor Robert
was so overcome by Therese's distress,
that he could neither say nor do any thing.
In silence we sat around the low bed,
while the irregular wheezing of the little
sufferer was painful to hear. He was in
great pain, and his little hands wandered
uneasily to his chest, as though there
was something oppressive there. The
physician, who had been in the adjoining
room asleep (for they had been up all

<!-- page 425 col 1 -->

night with Adolphe), came in and felt his
pulse.</p>

<p>"Doctor, is he no better?" asked Therese,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"He will be better when the blister
draws, madam."</p>

<p>"Oh, do tell me he is a little better!"
cried Therese.</p>

<p>For three hours we sat around the little
bed, watching for light in the dark, dilated
eye, while the mother, by every gentle
aid, sought to bring back the little spirit
to its home. In vain she called upon his
name, and pressed her lips upon his own.
The breath came painfully and quick, and
the intense, unnatural eye was fixed. At
last, I felt his hand grow moist within my
own, and his lips were moving. Therese
bent her ear and hung over him, to hear
him say "mamma." She raised her eyes
to heaven, and her illuminated face proclaimed
the intense thankfulness of her
heart.</p>

<p>"My son, our good God has heard my
prayer," she said, kissing him over and
over again. At these words he clasped
his little hands, and instinctively commenced,
in faint, low tones, "Our Father
who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy
name, &amp;c." He finished his prayer,
taught him by the earnest-hearted little
mother, and then he placed his arm about
her neck, and there were moist eyes around
the little bed. Robert, who had been
sitting apart at the window, came and sat
down by the bed, and kissed the darling
boy, and Therese gave him her hand with
a grateful, tender look.</p>

<p>But though the fever was somewhat
abated, Adolphe was very weak. His
little hands, once so plump and dimpled,
were thin and transparent&mdash;his eyes were
large and hollow. He was patient and
uncomplaining. Like his mother, so gentle
and grateful, thanking us sweetly for
every thing, and talking in his simple,
childish way: "Mamma, where is old
Punch?"</p>

<p>"Old Punch has been in very many
times, looking for his little master," said
Therese, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"He misses me, I know. I wonder if
he knows I'm sick, mamma?"</p>

<p>"He <i>feels</i> that you are sick; old Punch
<i>feels</i> that something is the matter with
our boy, for he goes whining about the
house, and is not happy and frisky like he
used to be," said Therese, smoothing back
his hair.</p>

<p>Robert said old Punch was lying at the
door, looking inquiringly at all who passed.
He opened the door, and the great
dog came in and went straight to the
bed.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" said Adolphe. Punch

<!-- page 425 col 2 -->

wagged his shaggy tail, and laid his nose
upon the pillow, looking earnestly at his
little playfellow.</p>

<p>"Poor old Punch!" said Adolphe, patting
his head, and the dog placed his
paws upon the bed, watching his little
master.</p>

<p>"Why, old dog!" cried the boy, stretching
his arms around his great white circled
neck. The sagacious creature was proud
of this. He stood with his white paws
upon the edge of the bed, and his nose
upon the pillow, and kept slowly opening
his eyes and shutting them in excess of
happiness, and getting closer and closer
to his little master, until in his joy he
licked the boy's forehead, and put his
paws upon his neck, and seemed scarcely
to know how to show his delight and his
affection.</p>

<p>"Mamma, he wants me to get up and
go with him."</p>

<p>"He must wait until you are strong
enough," said Therese, placing her hand
on the dog's head, who laid his nose back
upon the pillow, "and then we'll go with
dear old Punch, to play on the garden
falls."</p>

<p>"Not on the flower-beds, mamma."</p>

<p>"No, not on the flower-beds," said
Therese, her face coloring, "but on the
high green falls, where the cherry limbs
hang so low."</p>

<p>"The black-heart cherries? I know
which tree that is."</p>

<p>"Yes, Punch knows the tree too."</p>

<p>"I can climb up that tree, mamma."</p>

<p>"You can! When you get strong
enough, I will push you up that tree."</p>

<p>"There is a cat-bird nest up there.
John held me up, and I peeped into it.
The old cat-bird stays there all day."</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;and mocking-birds, and jay
birds too. We will go there some of
these fine days, you, and I, and Punch.
But my little boy must sleep some now."</p>

<p>"Somebody must sing to me; mamma,
you sing."</p>

<p>And Therese, so earnest in her devotion,
sang a soft lullaby for her boy. He turned
over and nestled close to her, and she
sang the baby song she always sang to
him when he slept. Robert was too weak-hearted
for such tender scenes. He was
a very woman in his nature, and he stole
away, while the mother sang in liquid
tones, though her eyes were filled with
tears.</p>

<p>The next day we hoped the dear child
was better, and Robert and I concluded
to return home. Therese drew my brother
to the window, and asked if he would
do her a favor. Of course Robert was
ready and anxious to do any thing he could
for her.</p>

<!-- page 426 col 1 -->

<p>"Send your good mother to me, will
you?" said Therese, sadly. "I want
somebody who is older than I am. I
want your good mother with me now.
Beg her to come and stay with me until
my boy gets well. She is so kind and
gentle, and she lost a little boy once.
Perhaps I may have to suffer what she
has. She can feel for me, I know she
can."</p>

<p>"My dear Therese, we all sympathize
with you," said Robert.</p>

<p>"I know, oh I know you do. You
have all been more than kind. But your
mother&mdash;<i>she</i> knows the sorrow of my
heart. She told me of her little boy&mdash;her
first-born&mdash;and showed me his little grave.
I have thought of all this in the long,
still hours, when I've been watching him.
He is not like himself. He grows purer,
and more tender, and so thoughtful.
Heaven may be drawing him, gently drawing
my boy away!"</p>

<p>"We must hope for the best, my dear
Therese," said Robert, pressing her hand,
while the tears came to his eyes. She
turned to the bed, and took the limp hand
which was reaching to her.</p>

<p>We went home and sent mamma to poor
Therese.</p>

<p>In a week mamma wrote:</p>

<p>"The little boy grows visibly worse. I
think, with poor Therese, that he is being
gradually drawn to heaven. He is very
feeble. His little frame is wasted to a
shadow, and his eyes are very bright&mdash;too
bright for earth. I have comforted the
mother all I could, but this is the Father's
work: I cannot bid her be comforted, but
there is One greater than I, who will teach
her that all is for the best." And in a
postscript, she said Adolphe was dead.
The little spirit had returned to its Home,
and the pride of the mother's heart was in
Heaven.</p>

<p>Poor little Adolphe!</p>

<p>Poor Therese was left with mamma.
And she glided about our house, carrying
her great sorrow in her gentle bosom, and
looking up to us through her tears.
Louise would take her hand at evening
and walk far away, and try to win her

<!-- page 426 col 2 -->

back to life. Mamma, with gentle
thought, would bid her take the keys,
and go on errands for her, that she might,
for a moment, forget her loss. And I
would try to do my part by talking,&mdash;not
cheerfully, but a shade more cheerfully
than any of us felt, that by degrees we
might call her away from her great and
constant grief. Papa, too, had a gentle
thought for her&mdash;and would come in
from squirrel hunting, and calling her to
him, would ask her to have the squirrels
served up in her capital way for his dinner.
Sometimes he would cry out from the Library,
to Therese to mix his porter for
him, or to prepare his toddy, or to do any
thing, which he knew would please her.</p>

<p>Robert kept away. He felt more than
all, but he could not approach her.</p>

<p>After a while, Therese said she must
return to Mr. Blanton's. She could not
desert them altogether. They were lonely
and felt her loss, and missed, at every
turn, the same little foot-fall which she
mourned.</p>

<p>It was twilight, and the pensive mournful
figure stole away from the quiet family
circle to the grave of her darling boy.
She had been gone an hour, and the heavy
dew was falling on her bowed head.
Robert was restless. He wanted to go to
her, but how disturb her in the sanctity
of her grief?</p>

<p>"Mamma, if I were to go to her, and
lead her gently back?" he said, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Go, my son, but be gentle with her."</p>

<p>Robert went up the winding pathway,
looking for the mourner at the little
grave. He found her kneeling with her
white hands clasped and her eyes turned
to heaven.</p>

<p>"My poor Therese!" said Robert, sitting
down and drawing her gently to him.</p>

<p>"Poor, poor Therese," she murmured,
bending her head upon her hand, "this
blow is too much&mdash;too much!"</p>

<p>"And can I do nothing for my poor
Therese?" said Robert, tenderly.</p>

Gradually Therese returned to life.
She seemed to think it selfish to sadden
gay hearts with her presence, and at last,
with many tears she left us.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

</div>

<p>IN the course of time, Tom Farren became
unfortunate. He had proposed six
times to Louise, and exactly six times had
he been rejected. He was anxious to
marry, and to marry well. He thought
Louise a most estimable, well bred young
lady, who would show to decided advantage
as Mrs. Farren. He particularly
admired her hauteur, and reserve. She
could not have employed a more effectual
method of binding young Farren's heart,
than by indulging in her natural imperturbable
dignity and hauteur. He did
not think she was less kind to him than
she was to others. He was quite sure
Dashwood had never won more smiles
than he had. But Tom Farren could not
fathom such a heart. He knew not the
depth of the still waters. He knew not
of the fairy palace reared beneath the polished
surface, and of the gem-like hopes
all shining there. What could <i>he</i> know
of the gorgeous dream-land in which this
placid beauty revelled?</p>

<p>Meantime Dashwood's beautiful book
was insinuating its smoothly flowing sentiments
into every heart. People were
speaking of him as of a genius. Young
ladies, of romantic temperaments, were
inditing odorous epistles to him, and some
leading men were determined to take him
by the hand. Our <i>attach&eacute;</i> was on the
wing, and sustaining himself beautifully,
like a young eagle born to fly in the very
eye of the sun.</p>

<p>Dashwood had written that he was
coming home. Miss Ellen McGregor had
written very many times, exulting in her
nephew's success, thanking us for all our
kindness to him, and predicting still more
wonderful things, of this most gifted of
mortals.</p>

<p>Mrs. Braxley, highly offended at her
<i>proteg&eacute;e's</i> want of taste in refusing Tom
Farren six times, made a will out of spite,
and left me every dollar she had in the
world. This sudden change in her temporal
affairs alarmed me very much, inasmuch
as Mr. Farren began to talk to me
one evening, after dinner, about a model
bee-hive. Grandma&mdash;when Mr. Farren
took a chair, strode across the room, and
planted himself upright in front of me&mdash;was
visibly affected.</p>

<p>I, who knew that Aunt Braxley made
half a dozen wills per annum, was very
much shocked at this rash proceeding.
Nobody enjoyed Mr. Farren's demonstrations
more than Uncle Joe, whose vein of

<!-- page 492 col 2 -->

fun was not yet exhausted. Grandma
would have had me&mdash;the fastidious authoress&mdash;the
destined historian of the
Feejees&mdash;the light of the nineteenth century&mdash;fairly
to jump at such a proposal.
She implored me not to be so foolishly
blind to my own interests. She promised
to keep Aunt Braxley to that last will
and testament, but I could not consent to
any such uncertainty. At last, Grandma
gave over her persuasions, and bade me go
and be an old maid, she did not care.</p>

<p>The subject now uppermost in our
thoughts was Dashwood's return. My
brother was so impatient to see his friend,
that he must needs go a hundred miles to
meet him. Louise, with glittering eye
and high lifted head, went on in the even
tenor of her way&mdash;and on the very day
she expected her lover, the daring girl
managed to have an engagement to dine
out. Her heart was certainly pitched an
octave higher than other people's. She
ordered the carriage and drove off about
an hour before the ardent lover was
expected. On her way, she met Tom
Farren, who was doubtless coming over
to see the meeting, and I need not say,
she left that orderly, systematic young
man, completely petrified on the highway.</p>

<p>Dashwood and Robert came, driven
home triumphantly by Sap, and drawn by
the ponies. As soon as Dashwood descended
lightly from the open carriage, Grandma
squeaked out in a high treble, "Oh,
gracious! what a sweet, love of a fellow!"</p>

<p>Papa met him with a hearty welcome.
Mamma brushed away a tear, and the
noble fellow took both her hands in his
own, and kissed her. He greeted Grandma
with elaborate and chivalrous respect,
and Mrs. Braxley with profound obedience.
But Uncle Joe&mdash;kind-hearted, beaming
Uncle Joe&mdash;he took in his arms, whirled
him around, and such a meeting as they
had, somewhat opened Mrs. Braxley's
eyes, and caused Grandma to guess there
was a spy in the camp. Dashwood's eye
now sought Louise, and there was a slight
shade perceptible in his face.</p>

<p>Louise could not complain of demonstrations
now, or fear an <i>expos&eacute;</i>. His
<i>hardiesse</i> was quite equal to her own.
He was as pleasant and entertaining as
though her royal eye had been upon him.
A malicious person would have said he
was not so much in love after all. That
he could, at least, exist without her.
Late in the evening, the young lady,
accompanied by Mr. Farren, arrived.

<!-- page 493 col 1 -->

Dashwood encountered her, purposely I
dare say, before she expected it; and he
had the satisfaction to see the pearly
cheek flush in a moment, and the eye,
with its jealous lash, glisten, as he took
her hand. He had scarcely time to mark
the tremor and the blush, ere Louise had
recovered, and welcomed him in her clear
silver tones. But my sister looked more
beautiful that evening, than ever before.
There was a tinge upon her cheek which
was not always there, and a light in her
magnificent eyes which was seldom seen.
She smiled several times on Mr. Farren,
but not once on Dashwood. It was so
like her, Dashwood said, to go off when
she expected him. She did not wish to
meet him in the portico, when all were
clamoring a welcome. She was so exquisitely
refined, that she dreaded the shock,
and feared for her boasted self-possession.</p>

<p>"Now when we met," he said, after
Mr. Farren had left, and he could summon
the boldness to draw very near to
Louise&mdash;"now, dear Jenny, when we
met, this young lady was almost tempted
to scream."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Louise, for the first
time raising her eyes to his.</p>

<p>"She wanted very much to faint," continued
Dashwood, "and, with all her placidity,
she has yet to conquer some very
rebellious emotions."</p>

<p>Louise smiled, and Dashwood seemed
to be never tired of looking at her. Robert
hung about this beautiful pair. He seemed
to exult in their happiness, and to watch
their countenances with vivid delight.</p>

<p>Papa saw the change in Louise. He
saw his beautiful child, as if by magic,
looking her former self. He saw her
lovely and serene, in the fulness of her
happiness. He saw mamma too, as she
unconsciously betrayed, in every action,
her love for the poet. He saw us all
clustering around him, listening to him,
devouring him with our eyes, enjoying
his anecdotes, electrified by his happy
sallies, and forgetting every thing but the
bliss of our reunion; and papa was almost
conquered.</p>

<p>Even grandma was drawn within this
magic circle, around which uncle Joe fluttered,
like a man whose judgment could
not always control the limbs of his body,
even in a certain person's awful presence.</p>

<p>Finally, after a long conversation with
mamma, Robert, and myself, papa came
into measures.</p>

<p>"To confess the truth," said papa to us,
"when a man has such dutiful and respectful
children, he can scarcely find it
in his heart to deny them any thing. He
must not allow his prejudices and preferences
to interfere with their happiness.

<!-- page 493 col 2 -->

There is something due from me to my
children, as well as from them to me. It
is my duty to be reasonable with so respectful
and gentlemanly a fellow as my
son Robert; and it also becomes me to
yield a point to a young lady who has
proved herself so noble as my daughter
Louise. This I do proudly; because it is
my duty and privilege thus to reward
such respect and such obedience."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" cried Robert, "I knew how
it would all end!"</p>

<p>"A very weak father, a vastly weak
father," was Mrs. Barbara's comment, on
learning the state of affairs.</p>

<p>"A man after my own heart, by Jove!"
cried uncle Joe.</p>

<p>"My own dear papa!" cried Louise,
rushing to his arms.</p>

<p>"Why, Dabney!" remarked Mrs. Braxley,
with elevated brows.</p>

<p>"God bless him!" interrupted uncle
Joe, snapping his fingers under the very
eyes of his sovereign mistress.</p>

<p>"Why, Joseph!" ejaculated the astonished
lady.</p>

<p>Hearing that Miss Willianna was no
longer in the market, and that there was
no danger of his being caught by that
cunning angler, while Robert was devoting
himself to Therese, Dashwood consented
to accompany Mr. Rushton, junior, to see
his lady love. My brother was himself
again with Dashwood. He forgot all
trouble and care in his gay presence.
Never were two gallants so perfectly congenial;
Robert was always piquant and
original to Dashwood, and Dashwood was
always gloriously brilliant to Robert.
Louise became really merry in their society.
Fairy Hill acknowledged the presence
of its master spirit in Dashwood.
Papa, too, yielded to the irresistible charm
of his manner, and grew excessively fond
of his society. Dashwood had many adventures
to relate, and talked of every
thing but his book. His success, his few
laurels so recently won, his increasing
popularity, his high standing among men
of letters&mdash;all this was a sealed volume
with him. He was ever the unselfish and
elegant gentleman, pleasing all, but never
vaunting himself. Never boasting in word,
or look, but wearing his new honors with
a modest grace. But what was new to us
was not so to him. It was nothing new
to him that he could write charmingly&mdash;that
he was master of all the intricacies
of the language&mdash;that poetry flowed spontaneously
from his pen, and that he had
the material within him of which great
men are formed. He must have felt a
consciousness of this from boyhood. He
must have known this amid all his vagaries,
and therefore he was not unduly

<!-- page 494 col 1 -->

exalted when the world acknowledged it.
He was a thorough artist, humbled at his
own success, and evading any allusion
which might lead to the subject of his
honors.</p>

<p>The two friends went off together to
see Therese. She ran out, and greeted
them before they reached the steps. Dashwood
said some gentle words to her, and
pressed his lips upon her hand; and she
bravely conquered all her emotion, and
put her arm in Robert's, in her trusting,
childlike way, and looked up to her handsome
lover with sweet and winning pride.
She showed them into a cosy morning
room, where the happy Willianna was
sitting sewing. Dashwood said the dear
little woman was so changed. All her
bewildering little coquetries were gone;
her pleasant wiles and pretty, artless fascinations
completely subdued. She was
tearful, but brave. She kept close to
Robert. She felt the need of some one
to cling to; and he was proud of the delicate,
trusting creature at his side.</p>

<p>Dashwood said it was the most beautiful
tableau he ever saw&mdash;Therese and
Robert. And while he rattled away to
Miss Blanton, he had yet an eye for them.
Robert, so manly and tender, and Therese,
so chastened and purified, turning
her soft eye upon him with coy confidingness;
and then forgetting herself, and
betraying unconsciously her deep devotion,
and her woman's pride in him she
had chosen. It was beautiful, most refreshingly
beautiful, said Dashwood, with
an "ah!" as he related all this to Louise,
in the vain hope of softening his obdurate
fair one.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he continued, half soliloquizing,
"if Louise will ever lay her hand
upon my shoulder, and say, Frank, or,
indeed, any thing else; I would give all I
have to hear."</p>

<p>Uncle Joe accidentally overheard this
remark, and he immediately hobbled up
to the desponding lover, to inform him,
that he might depend upon it Louise could
say enough when she chose.</p>

<p>"I have heard her&mdash;&mdash;dear me! You
don't know Louise. I think she's rash at
times; indeed I do."</p>

<p>Dashwood turned to Louise, and she
was blushing beautifully.</p>

<p>My sister, with all her composure, was
excessively diffident&mdash;too diffident, in fact,
to let people know what she really was;
and Dashwood would not have had her
otherwise. He was a most jealous lover,
and could not have borne what poor
Robert endured at the Black Mountain
Springs.</p>

<p>It was very well for the lives of all her
lovers that Louise was thus chary of her

<!-- page 494 col 2 -->

smiles. Had she been one shade less
prudish and disdainful, I should have had
some heartrending murders and bloody
duels to relate. These dull pages would
have been garnished with exploits on Mr.
Dashwood's part almost exceeding belief.
Othello would have been an angel to my
hero. Happily for me&mdash;for I have no talent
for such gloomy details&mdash;my sister
gave him no cause for jealousy. Her rigid
propriety and uncompromising fidelity
were the anchor of his life. Loving so
intensely, it was fortunate that she was
so firm. Had she rejected him once, or
wavered in the least, this intrepid fellow,
after doing serious damage, would have
cut his own throat.</p>

<p>The Dandy scheme was now about to be
consummated. Miss Blanton was soon to
be led to the Hymeneal altar by her Black
Mountain Captive. Weddings were rare
in the Blanton family; and this was to be
a prodigious affair. The note of preparation
was sounded months before the happy
day. Mrs. Braxley was invited over
to the Grove to matronize the fair Willianna,
and to act as generalissimo of the
Blanton forces. Mrs. Braxley, proud of
her reputation, and delighting in power,
took possession of the Grove. She very
unceremoniously turned the house out of
the windows and the astonished Blanton
and menagerie out of doors, and commenced
operations on an alarming and
Ph&oelig;bean scale. Sappingwood, who was
occasionally sent over with messages and
injunctions from Mrs. Barbara to her
daughter, reported that Mrs. Braxley was
turning up Jack at the Grove, and making
the Blanton servants "hop linky."</p>

<p>The lovely Willianna, in "maiden meditation
fancy free," while the house was
apparently being pulled down over her
ears, awaited the auspicious day. The
wedding day arrived; and beaux and
belles, and old and young, were congregated
together at the Grove to witness the
ceremony, and partake of the good cheer
so lavishly provided. The amount of
jewelry worn by Miss Blanton on this interesting
occasion had better not be specified.
My readers would not believe me
if I were to tell them. Poor Dandy was
terribly scared, and shockingly dressed. I
should say he was happy the evening
Blanton encountered him in the badly-ventilated
corner, compared to what he
was on the evening of his marriage. He
took Willianna upon the wrong arm, and
could scarcely be made to understand that
the wedding ring was not intended for
that lovely creature's thumb. Even after
the ceremony, when one would naturally
expect to see him somewhat composed,
this Black Mountain Captive seemed in

<!-- page 495 col 1 -->

an awkward trance. In dancing he managed
to wind his feet in several yards of
thule belonging to his bride's apparel, and
to get a dreadful fall. At supper, he got
choked with a chicken's wing, and had
several stout fellows thumping him on
the back before he could recover his
breath. None of this escaped Dashwood's
eye. My brother had commissioned
him to use all his comic powers
upon Therese. Robert was pining to see
her revive, and Dashwood strove zealously
to bring back the coquettish smiles, and
their attendant dimples, which had first
ensnared his susceptible friend. Therese
could not resist Dashwood's drollery. She
laughed when he called her attention to
Dandy wound up in thule, and struggling
on the floor, while the band paused for
his release, and bid her behold the Dandy
of the day! Robert was ever near her,
catching her smiles and watching the old
light of early summer days, as it broke
beautifully on her brow.</p>

<p>Grandma was at the wedding. A gay illusion
cap, and a new velvet, with many
new airs and graces, were brought out for
the occasion. No swan ever curved her
neck more complacently, than did this triumphant
belle of old, as she circled about
the illuminated rooms. These were the
weddings for her, she informed her friends.
None of your blue-nosed morning affairs
for her, she never attended them at all.
She loved the real old Virginia "break
downs," when the masters' heads swam
in champagne, and the servants' in apple
toddy.</p>

<p>"The Blarntons are old Virginia aristocrats,"
she remarked. "The family never
do things by halves. A relative of theirs,
Col. William Blarnton of Reedy Creek,
gave a party on one occasion which finally
drove him to prison."</p>

<p>"That costly and magnificent entertainment,"
said Mrs. Barbara, who was in one
of her happiest moods, "was given to me
when I was married, and I always larfed
and told Mr. Rushton that Col. Blarnton
had given me his estate." In this delightful
manner that brilliant conversationist,
Mrs. Barbara, beguiled many a weary
wall flower on that memorable evening.</p>

<p>Sappingwood, illustrious valet, also distinguished
himself here. It seemed that
since Dashwood's return, that remarkable
servant had dropped his master, and taken
the poet for his model, in dress, manner,
carriage, and the small courtesies generally.
Knowing that our <i>ex attach&eacute;</i> was
just returned from the seat of grace and
fashion, Sappingwood kept his eye upon
him, and was often seen practising the last
tip before a large mirror in my brother's
dressing-room. Now there was at the

<!-- page 495 col 2 -->

wedding a notorious exquisite, who imagined
himself partially eclipsed by Dashwood,
and who had not failed to observe
Sap's fidelity in all his movements to his
illustrious original. In the gentlemen's
dressing-room Sap figured largely, and
being an adept in matters of taste and
style, was, of course, in great demand.
The exquisite, wishing to throw some ridicule
on Dashwood, gave his valet an order
in French. To his surprise, Sap approached
him with a bow, and said:</p>

<p>"Que voulez-vous, monsieur?" with the
very air and accent of Dashwood true to
the life.</p>

<p>Highly pleased at his success, the exquisite,
in order to stimulate him to further
displays, languidly extended a bank-note,
and asked Sap in drawling tones if
he would be kind enough to recognize
a V?</p>

<p>Sap, having exhausted his French, replied
in his vernacular, "Certainly, sir,"
remarking with a very low bow, as he put
up the note in his red morocco pocket-book,
that he always made it a point to
recognize a friend in any company, though
he would do the V's the justice to say
that he had never heard of their being
seen with the gentleman before.</p>

<p>After the marriage ceremony, grandma
came majestically to me, and gave it
as her deliberate and unalterable opinion,
that Mrs. Dandy was still an old maid!</p>

<p>"Nothing under the sun," said Mrs. Barbara
solemnly, "no ring&mdash;no priest&mdash;no
ceremony&mdash;can prevent that unfortunate
woman from being an old maid."</p>

<p>"If she were to marry forty times,"
continued the dowager in a chilling whisper,
which made the blood run cold, "she
would still be an old maid! And she
might remove from here, and settle with
that truly remarkable creature, Dandy, in
Texas if she chose, and every man, woman
and child would know her to be an
old maid. Old maid is written on her
forehead&mdash;is heard in her voice&mdash;is legible
on the very finger on which she wears her
wedding ring. You might blindfold me,
and only let me hear her voice, and I
should immediately exclaim, 'There speaks
an old maid of forty!' You might take
me to Jericho, and just by way of experiment
show me one single ringlet&mdash;the
smallest tip of one of her corkscrew curls,
and what would I say? Why I would
immediately exclaim, 'This belonged to an
old maid of forty!' I should, upon my
word. Therefore, I repeat it, what hope
is there for her? Can she escape? No&mdash;emphatically
no. She is, Dandy or no
Dandy&mdash;priest or no priest&mdash;an old maid
until doomsday!"</p>

<p>Uncle Joe forgot his rheumatism at this

<!-- page 496 col 1 -->

wedding. I am inclined to think that he
was even oblivious of his rash alliance
with Mrs. Barbara's daughter. I was informed
that uncle Joe coaxed a company
of chosen spirits into a remote room, and
having carefully closed the door, sang to
them in dulcet tones two of his favorite
songs, "Oh no, I never mention her," and
"Meet me by moonlight alone, in the
grove at the end of the vale." They say
uncle Joe's inimitable singing brought
tears into his own eyes, but failed similarly
to affect his jolly hearers.</p>

<p>The next event I have to record is the
double wedding&mdash;Dashwood and Louise&mdash;Robert
and Therese. I am sorry to say
that this was a blue-nosed morning affair,
and of course the reader knows Mrs. Barbara
kept her room. When she learned
that breakfast was to be eaten at one
o'clock, she slammed the door in the face
of her informer, and said she did not care
if they ate it at midnight.</p>

<p>Therese, in her half-mourning, looked
beautiful but sad. She could not forget,
even in her happiness, the darling boy in
Heaven. She missed, even then, the prattling
tongue and childish caresses of the
little one she mourned, and she would
stealthily seek some quiet place to weep
alone. Robert, pained to see her thus,
was almost jealous of her sorrow. Once
he found her sitting alone in a back room,
crying bitterly. In her hand she held a
little blue shoe, all crumpled and worn,
and a coral necklace. She threw her soft
arms around her tender husband's neck,
and begged him to forgive her for crying
so much&mdash;and then she held up the little
wrinkled shoe, with its broken strings,
and wept again.</p>

<p>Now, if my readers would like to know
this dear Therese in her own fairy home,
they must come to Virginia; nay, they
must come to me, and I will show them
Robert and Therese, still young, and still
loving, and still happy. And I will take
great pleasure also in showing them a
little round-faced, bald-headed boy, who,
I regret to say, cries very much, and
makes very wry faces. My readers, particularly
my sentimental ones, would be
astonished to see my careless, fastidious
brother, with this round-faced boy in his
arms, walking him backwards and forwards,
tossing him, jumping him, until
my good brother is worn out with walking,
tossing, and jumping. This boy of
Robert's is considered a paragon of boys
in the family. He is certainly a most remarkable
boy. To convince my readers
of this, I have only to mention that he
cries for the candle&mdash;and yells terrifically
because prudent persons oppose his putting
his fingers in the blaze! Then he

<!-- page 496 col 2 -->

has been known to cry himself hoarse for
the new moon! He also cries to pull his
papa's hair&mdash;and most wonderful to relate,
cries for his uncle Blanton every
time he sees him! Such a compliment
from such a source astonishes Mr. Blanton&mdash;he
having been all his life as a dreadful
raw-head-and-bloody-bones to juveniles.
But this wonderful baby of Robert's
invariably sets up a yell to get to his
uncle Blanton; and Mr. Blanton, with a
grave face, takes the unaccountable infant
in his arms, handling him pretty much as
he would a rare and fragile specimen of
Bohemian ware; keeping him at arm's
length, and in such a unique and uncomfortable
position that baby squalls and
Therese laughs.</p>

<p>This boy is a subject of profound investigation
to Mr. Blanton. He has neglected
his menagerie to study this human problem.
He has examined him phrenologically,
physiologically, and psychologically,
and says he has some extraordinary developments.
He lectures Robert and
Therese on the manner in which so astonishing
a subject should be trained. He
lays down rules for his behavior, for
which baby has evidently no earthly respect.</p>

<p>Uncle Joe comes twice a week to see
the boy, and seems to think with Mr.
Blanton, that it is a wonderful child.
The Dandys live in great splendor, and
entertain magnificently. Mrs. Dandy and
Mrs. Braxley are inseparable. They are
most congenial spirits, and I think poor
Dandy has a fellow-feeling for uncle Joe.</p>

<p>Dashwood and Louise went to Europe
immediately after their marriage. My
sister returned from her travels improved
in manner and person. Her diffidence
and hauteur had given place to a charming
graciousness of manner, most fascinating
and delightful. Dashwood is now
living in a large city, and his lady is one
of the leaders of the ton. She is the
centre of a circle unsurpassed for wit and
refinement, and Mrs. Barbara, who is a
judge in these matters, says the hospitalities
of her house are dispensed with a
grace and elegance she never saw equalled.
My sister is one of the married belles,
and Dashwood the leader of the literati.
She is chaperoned by Miss Ellen McGregor
Dashwood, who has left her home in
Kent to devote her days to these beloved
relatives. Mrs. Dashwood comes to Fairy
Hill every summer, on her way to the
Springs. Mrs. Barbara evidently looks
up to her with great deference, and always
speaks of her granddaughter, Mrs. Dashwood,
when she wishes to impress people
with a proper sense of her dignity and importance.</p>

<!-- page 497 col 1 -->

<p>Dashwood is always busy. He comes
in great haste to Fairy Hill, calls a little
while at Robert's, looks in upon the Dandys,
and devotes a few odd hours to uncle
Joe. He is in such demand. People
want him every where. He has not even
time to accompany his own wife to the
sea-side. My sister, who is a lady of
fashion and independence, makes up her
own parties, and goes any where, leaving
her husband to pursue his business, or
his pleasure, as a fashionable lady should
do.</p>

<p>Therese, once so fond of admiration, is
completely domesticated, and devoted to
Robert and her boy. Louise, who was a
type of indomitable constancy, is now a
lady of ton, somewhat inclined to dissipation,
Dashwood says, and exulting in the
quantity and quality of her admirers.</p>

<p>Our glorious poet is still brilliant and
handsome, and jocund, and delightful.
He has a pleasant word and a beaming
smile for all. He has the art of dispensing
a few words to great profit. He has
something to say to every old family servant,
and a happy jest for dependents of
all grades. His way through the world
is but a triumphant march. And all this
is the effect of his most happy and irresistible
manner. His manner has made
him great among men&mdash;has won golden
opinions from the highest to the lowest&mdash;has
filled his once empty purse&mdash;has gathered
around his elegant wife the most
refined circle in Virginia&mdash;has riveted his
friends to him under all circumstances&mdash;has
brought him honor upon honor, and
will, ultimately, give him any position he
may demand. All this has been accomplished
by a happiness of address which
it is impossible to describe. Without it,
he might have been honorable and good,
and gifted, and sincere, but he would never
have been what he is. I need not
here dilate on the importance of tact, and
manner. Plato, himself, never lost an
opportunity to impress his pupils with
the great importance of a conciliatory address.
It can achieve more than is dreamed
of in the cynic's philosophy. It has
raised many a man to the highest honors
in our great Democracy, while the want
of it has caused talents of the first order
to remain unnoticed and unpreferred.</p>

<p>But moralizing is not my <i>forte</i>, as the
sagacious reader has doubtless perceived.

<!-- page 497 col 2 -->

I will not sift from these dull pages the
morals which lie therein embedded, as
the precious metal in California's barren
sands. I will not repeat that patience
and perseverance overcometh all things&mdash;nor
the commandment with promise,
wherein we are told to honor our fathers
and mothers, etc. Time will teach all
this&mdash;for as he goes noiselessly on, he
leaves his footprints in his wake.</p>

<p>He leaves (the stern old teacher) a few
more shining locks&mdash;steals a little lightness
from the lightest foot&mdash;tinges the
gayest hearts&mdash;casts a shadow where the
sun has ever shone&mdash;throws a quaintness
over the old hill house&mdash;peers in upon the
auburn curls&mdash;lifts the little boy upon
his round, rolling feet&mdash;lays the faithful
servant in his grave&mdash;checks the jocund
laugh&mdash;lends a cane to the once fleet of
foot&mdash;and thus he goes, and sprinkles
lesson upon lesson in his path.</p>

<p>And may he deal gently with thee, oh
martyr reader mine! may he not lag heavily
with thee over these pages. May
you close the book as the dinner-bell
rings, and say, "Ha! I did not think it
was so late!" And may you consult
your watch, and find old Time has stolen
a march upon you while you have been
with me.</p>

<p>And at dinner may you sip the choicest
wines, and astonish with your wit and
brilliancy, oh martyr reader mine!</p>

<p>May you hold up the dainty glass and
say, "Here's to the writer of the book
with which I have beguiled the morning!"
And may you in the overflowing
goodness of your heart, do violence to
your conscience, and say, "She wields a
graceful pen (!) upon my word&mdash;so here's
to her!"</p>

<p>Bless thee, reader mine! One word
from thee were worth all the vintage in
the world! One word from thee, would
give wings unto my pen and tranquillity
to my heart! One word from thee,
would lighten the family nose which I
am doomed to carry&mdash;would cause the
Feejees to be served up in a piquant style&mdash;would
set me to daguerreotyping Old
Virginia for life&mdash;would infuse new vigor
into the style and imagination of a lady
doomed to all the horrors of single-blessedness,
unless, with thy approval, she be
wedded to Immortality.</p>
