<p>OLYMPUS PUMP;</p>

<p class="small">OR, THE POETIC TEMPERAMENT.</p>

</div>

<p>IT is said that poetry is on the decline, and that as man
surrounds himself with artificial comforts, and devotes
his energies to purposes of practical utility, the sphere of
imagination becomes circumscribed, and the worship of
the Muses is neglected. We are somewhat disposed to
assent to this conclusion; the more from having remarked
the fact that the true poetic temperament is not so frequently
met with as it was a few years since, and that
the outward marks of genius daily become more rare.
Where the indications no longer exist, or where they
gradually disappear, it is but fair to conclude that the
thing itself is perishing. There are, it is true, many delightful
versifiers at the present moment, but we fear that
though they display partial evidences of inspiration upon
paper, the scintillations are deceptive. Their conduct
seldom exhibits sufficient proof that they are touched
with the celestial fire, to justify the public in regarding
them as the genuine article. Judging from the rules
formerly considered absolute upon this point, it is altogether
preposterous for your happy, well-behaved, well-dressed,
smoothly-shaved gentleman, who pays his debts,

<!-- page 8 -->

and submits quietly to the laws framed for the government
of the uninspired part of society, to arrogate to
himself a place in the first rank of the sons of genius,
whatever may be his merits with the gray goose quill.
There is something defective about him. The divine
<i>afflatus</i> has been denied, and though he may flap his
wings, and soar as high as the house-tops, no one can
think him capable of cleaving the clouds, and of playing
hide and seek among the stars. Even if he were to do
so, the spectator would either believe that his eyes deceived
him, or that the successful flight was accidental,
and owing rather to a temporary density of the atmosphere
than to a strength of pinion.</p>

<p>The true poetic temperament of the old school is a gift
as fatal, as that of being able to sing a good song is to a
youth with whom the exercise of the vocal organ is not
a profession. It was&mdash;and to a certain extent is&mdash;an
axiom, that an analogy almost perfect exists between the
poet and the dolphin. To exhibit their beautiful hues they
must both be on the broad road to destruction. We are
fully aware that it has been supposed by sceptical spirits
that there is some confusion of cause and effect in arriving
at this conclusion,&mdash;that there is no sufficient reason
that genius should be a bad citizen. The existence of
an irresistible impulse to break the shackles of conventionalism
has been doubted by the heterodox. They declare
that a disposition to do so is felt by most men, and
that aberrations are indulged in, partly from a principle
of imitation, because certain shining lights have thought
proper to render themselves as conspicuous for their eccentricities
as for their genius, and chiefly from a belief
that society expects such wanderings, and regards them
with lenity. But analysis is not our forte, even if we
were disposed to cavil at such convenient things as

<!-- page 9 -->

lumping generalities. Your inquiring philosophers are
troublesome fellows, and while we content ourselves
with the bare fact, let them seek <i>rerum cognoscere
causas</i>.</p>

<p>It is, however, a satisfaction to know that the full-blooded
merino is not yet quite extinct. Olympus Pump
is the personification of the temperament of which we
speak. Had there been a little less of the divine essence
of poesy mingled with the clay of which he is composed,
it would have been better for him. The crockery of his
moral constitution would have been the more adapted to
the household uses of this kitchen world. But Pump
delights in being the pure porcelain, and would scorn the
admixture of that base alloy, which, while it might render
him more useful, would diminish his ornamental qualities.
He proudly feels that he was intended to be a
mantel embellishment to bear bouquets, not a mere
utensil for the scullery; and that he is not now fulfilling
his destiny, arises solely from the envy and uncharitableness
of those gross and malignant spirits with which the
world abounds. Occupied continually in his mental
laboratory, fabricating articles which he finds unsaleable,
and sometimes stimulating his faculties with draughts
of Scheidam, the "true Hippocrene," he slips from
station to station, like a child tumbling down stairs; and
now, having arrived at the lowest round of fortune's ladder,
he believes it was envy that tugged at his coat-tails,
and caused his descent, and that the human race are a
vast band of conspirators. There are no M&aelig;cenases in
these modern times to help those who will not help themselves;
no, not even a Capel Lofft, to cheer the Pumps
of the nineteenth century. No kindly arm toils at the
handle: and if he flows, each Pump must pump for
himself. Such, at least, is the conclusion at which Olympus

<!-- page 10 -->

has arrived, and he has melancholy reasons for believing
that in his instance he is correct. Thus, while
his mind is clothing its varied fancies in rich attire, and
his exulting spirit is gambolling and luxuriating in the
clover and timothy of imagination's wide domain, or
drinking fairy Champagne and eating canvass-back ducks
in air-drawn palaces, his outward man is too frequently
enduring the sad reverse of these unreal delights. He
may often be seen, when the weather is cold, leaning his
back against a post on the sunny side of the street; his
hands, for lack of coin, filling his roomy pockets; his
curious toes peeping out at crannies to see the world;
an indulgence extended to them by few but the Pump
family; and his elbows and knees following the example
of his lower extremities. Distress, deep thought, or
some other potent cause has transplanted the roses from
the garden of his cheek to that no longer sterile promontory
his nose, while his chin shows just such a stubble
as would be invaluable for the polishing brush of a boot-black.</p>

<p>But luckily the poetic temperament has its compensations.
When not too much depressed, Olympus Pump has
a world of his own within his cranium; a world which
should be a model for that without,&mdash;a world in which
there is nothing to do, and every thing to get for the asking.
If in his periods of intellectual abstraction, the
external atmosphere should nip his frame, the high price
of coal affects him not. In the palace of the mind, fuel
costs nothing, and he can there toast himself brown free
of expense. Does he desire a tea-party?&mdash;the guests
are in his noddle at his call, willing to stay, or ready to
depart, at his command, without "standing on the order
of their going;" and the imagined tables groan with
viands which wealth might exhaust itself to procure.

<!-- page 11 -->

Does he require sweet music?&mdash;the poetic fancy can
perform an opera, or manufacture hosts of Frank Johnsons
in the twinkling of an eye; and the celestial creatures,
who waltz and <i>galope</i> in the spacious <i>salons</i> of his
brain-pan, are endowed with loveliness which reality
can never parallel.</p>

<p>With such advantages, Pump, much as he grumbles,
would not exchange the coruscations of his genius, which
flicker and flare like the aurora borealis, for a "whole
wilderness" of comfort, if it were necessary that he should
entertain dull, plodding thoughts, and make himself
"generally useful." Can he not, while he warms his
fingers at the fire of imagination, darn his stockings and
patch his clothes with the needle of his wit; wash his
linen and his countenance in the waters of Helicon; and,
sitting on the peak of Parnassus, devour imaginary fried
oysters with Apollo and the Muses?</p>

<p>But either "wool gathering" is not very profitable, or
else the envy, of which Pump complains is stronger
than ever; for not long since, after much poetic idleness,
and a protracted frolic, he was seen, in the witching time
of night, sitting on a stall in the new market house, for
the very sufficient reason that he did not exactly know
where else lodging proportioned to the state of his fiscal
department could be found. He spoke:</p>

<p>"How blue! how darkly, deeply, beautifully blue!&mdash;not
me myself, but the expanse of ether. The stars
wink through the curtain of the air, like a fond mother
to her drowsy child, as much as to say hush-a-by-baby
to a wearied world. In the moon's mild rays even the
crags of care like sweet rock-candy shine. Night is a
Carthagenian Hannibal to sorrow, melting its Alpine
steeps, whilst buried hope pops up revived and cracks
its rosy shins. Day may serve to light sordid man to

<!-- page 12 -->

his labours; it may be serviceable to let calabashes and
squashes see how to grow; but the poetic soul sparkles
beneath the stars. Genius never feels its oats until
after sunset; twilight applies the spanner to the fireplug
of fancy to give its bubbling fountains way; and midnight
lifts the sluices for the cataracts of the heart, and
cries, 'Pass on the water!' Yes, and economically considered,
night is this world's Spanish cloak; for no matter
how dilapidated or festooned one's apparel may be,
the loops and windows cannot be discovered, and we
look as elegant and as beautiful as get out. Ah!" continued
Pump, as he gracefully reclined upon the stall,
"it's really astonishing how rich I am in the idea line
to-night. But it's no use. I've got no pencil&mdash;not even
a piece of chalk to write 'em on my hat for my next
poem. It's a great pity ideas are so much of the soap-bubble
order, that you can't tie 'em up in a pocket handkerchief,
like a half peck of potatoes, or string 'em on a
stick like catfish. I often have the most beautiful notions
scampering through my head with the grace, but alas!
the swiftness too, of kittens&mdash;especially just before I get
asleep&mdash;but they're all lost for the want of a trap; an
intellectual figgery four. I wish we could find out the
way of sprinkling salt on their tails, and make 'em wait
till we want to use 'em. Why can't some of the meaner
souls invent an idea catcher for the use of genius? I'm
sure they'd find it profitable, for I wouldn't mind owing
a man twenty dollars for one myself. Oh, for an idea
catcher!"</p>

<p>Owen Glendower failed in calling up spirits, but the
eloquence of Pump was more efficacious. In the heavy
shadow of a neighbouring pile of goods a dark mass appeared
to detach itself, as if a portion of the gloom had
suddenly become animated. It stepped forth in the

<!-- page 13 -->

likeness of a man, mysteriously wrapped up, whose eyes
glared fiercely, and with a sinister aspect, as he advanced
towards the poet. Pump stared in silence&mdash;he felt like
an idea, and as if the catcher were close at hand, ready to
pounce upon it. "Catching the idea" for once seemed a
disagreeable operation. The parties confronted each other
for a time without saying a word. A cloud hurrying
across the moon lent additional terror to the scene, and
the unknown, to Pump's astonished vision, appeared to
swell to a supernatural size. The stranger, at last,
waved his arm, hemmed thrice, and in the deep, decisive
tones of one used to command, said:</p>

<p>"It's not a new case&mdash;it's been decided frequent.
It's clearly agin the ordination made and provided, and
it's likewise agin the act"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah me! what act?" ejaculated the astonished
Pump.</p>

<p>"To fetch yourself to anchor on the stalls. It isn't
what the law considers pooty behaviour, and no gemman
would be cotched at it. To put the case, now,
would it be genteel for a man to set on the table at
dinner-time? Loafing on the stalls is jist as bad as
rolling among the dishes."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that all? I'm immersed in poetic conceptions;
I'm holding sweet communion with my own desolate
affections. Leave me, leave me to the luxuriance of
imagination; suffer me, as it were, to stray through the
glittering realms of fancy."</p>

<p>"What! on a mutton butcher's shambles? Bless you,
I can't think of it for a moment. My notions is rigid,
and if I was to find my own daddy here, I'd rouse him
out. You must tortle off, as fast as you kin. If your
tongue wasn't so thick, I'd say you must mosey; but
moseying is only to be done when a gemman's half shot;

<!-- page 14 -->

when they're gone cases, we don't expect 'em to do
more nor tortle."</p>

<p>"Excuse me&mdash;I don't see that it makes much difference
to you whether I am qualified to mosey, or am
only capable of the more dignified method of locomotion,
which you call to tortle. But don't disturb me. The
moon has resuscitated my fancy, and I feel as if I would
shortly compose an ode to Nox and Erebus."</p>

<p>"Compose what's owed to Messrs. Nox and Erebus!
Yes, I thought you were one of that sort what makes
compositions when they owe any thing. Precious little
Nox and Erebus will get out of you. But come, hop
the twig!" So saying, the relentless guardian of the
night seized the hapless Pump by the collar, and began to
remove him.</p>

<p>"Now, don't&mdash;don't be gross and muscular. I'm an
oppressed man, with no friend but my coat, and both
my coat and myself are remarkable for fragility of constitution.
We are free souls, vibrating on the breath of
the circumambient atmosphere, and by long companionship,
our sympathies are so perfect, that if you pull hard
you'll produce a pair of catastrophes; while you tear the
one, you'll discombobberate the nerves of the other."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm be blamed!" said the watch, recoiling,
"did you ever hear the likes of that? Why, aunty, ain't
you a noncompusser?"</p>

<p>"I'm a poet, and it's my fate not to be understood
either by the world in general, or by Charleys in particular.
The one knocks us down, and the others
take us up. Between the two, we are knocked about
like a ball, until we become unravelled, and perish."</p>

<p>"I don't want to play shinney with you, no how&mdash;why
don't you go home?"</p>

<p>"The bottle is empty; the bill unpaid; landlords are

<!-- page 15 -->

vulgar realities&mdash;mere matters of fact&mdash;and very apt to
vituperate."</p>

<p>"Well, it's easy enough to work, get money, fill the
bottle, and pay the gemman what you owes him."</p>

<p>"I tell you again you can't understand the poetic soul.
It cannot endure the scorn and contumelies of the earthly.
It cannot submit to toil under a taskmaster, and when
weaving silver tissues of romance, be told to jump about
spry and 'tend the shop. Nor, when it meets congenial
spirits, can it leave the festive board, because the door is
to be locked at ten o'clock, and there isn't any dead latch
to it. The delicate excesses into which it leads us, to
repair the exhaustion of hard thought, compel us to
sojourn long in bed, and even that is registered by fip-and-levy
boobies as a sin. At the present moment, I am
falling a victim to these manifold oppressions of the unintellectual."</p>

<p>"Under the circumstances, then, what do you say to
being tuck up?"</p>

<p>"Is it optional?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; but it's fineable, and that's as good."</p>

<p>"Then I decline the honour."</p>

<p>"No, you don't. I only axed out of manners. You
must rise up, William Riley, and come along with me,
as the song says."</p>

<p>"I suppose I must, whether I like the figure or not.
Alack, and alas for the poetic temperament! Must the
&AElig;olian harp of genius be so rudely swept by a Charley&mdash;must
that harp, as I may say, play mere banjo jigs, when
it should only respond in Lydian measures to the southern
breezes of palpitating imagination? To what base
uses"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hurrah! Keep a toddling&mdash;pull foot and away!"</p>

<p>Olympus obeyed; for who can control his fate?</p>

<hr/>

<p>'TIS ONLY MY HUSBAND.*</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="small">[*It may not be amiss to state that the mere conclusion of the
above sketch, hastily thrown off by the same pen, appeared in one
of our periodicals a few years ago, and, much mutilated and disfigured,
has since been republished in the newspapers, with an erroneous
credit, and under a different name.]</p>

<p>"GOODNESS, Mrs. Pumpilion, it's a gentleman's voice,
and me such a figure!" exclaimed Miss Amanda Corntop,
who had just arrived in town to visit her friend,
Mrs. Pumpilion, whom she had not seen since her marriage.</p>

<p>"Don't disturb yourself, dear," said Mrs. Pumpilion,
quietly, "it's nobody&mdash;'tis only my husband. He'll
not come in; but if he does, 'tis only my husband."</p>

<p>So Miss Amanda Corntop was comforted, and her
agitated arrangements before the glass being more coolly
completed, she resumed her seat and the interrupted conversation.
Although, as a spinster, she had a laudable
and natural unwillingness to be seen by any of the masculine
gender in that condition so graphically described
as "such a figure," yet there are degrees in this unwillingness.
It is by no means so painful to be caught a
figure by a married man as it is to be surprised by a
youthful bachelor; and, if the former be of that peculiar
class known as "only my husband," his unexpected
arrival is of very little consequence. He can never
more, "like an eagle in a dove cote, flutter the Volsces."

<!-- page 17 -->

It is, therefore, evident that there exists a material difference
between "my husband" and "only my husband;"
a difference not easily expressed, though perfectly understood;
and it was that understanding which restored
Miss Amanda Corntop to her pristine tranquillity.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Miss Corntop, when she heard that the
voice in question was that of Mr. Pumpilion. "Ah!"
added Miss Corntop, intelligently and composedly, when
she understood that Pumpilion was "only my husband."
She had not paid much attention to philology,
but she was perfectly aware of the value of that diminutive
prefix "only."</p>

<p>"I told you he would not come in, for he knew there
was some one here," continued Mrs. Pumpilion, as the
spiritless footsteps of "only my husband" passed the
door, and slowly plodded up stairs. He neither came
in, nor did he hum, whistle, or bound three steps at a
time; "only my husband" never does. He is simply a
transportation line; he conveys himself from place to
place according to order, and indulges not in episodes
and embellishments.</p>

<p>Poor Pedrigo Pumpilion! Have all thy glories shrunk
to this little measure? Only my husband! Does that
appellation circumscribe him who once found three
chairs barely sufficient to accommodate his frame, and
who, in promenading, never skulked to the curb or
hugged the wall, but, like a man who justly appreciated
himself, took the very middle of the <i>trottoir</i>, and kept it?</p>

<p>The amiable, but now defunct, Mrs. Anguish was
never sure that she was perfectly well, until she had
shaken her pretty head to ascertain if some disorder were
not lying in ambush, and to discover whether a headache
were not latent there, which, if not nipped in the
bud, might be suddenly and inconveniently brought into

<!-- page 18 -->

action. It is not too much to infer that the same reasoning,
which applies to headaches and to the physical constitution,
may be of equal force in reference to the moral
organization. Headaches being latent, it is natural to
suppose that the disposition to be "only my husband"
may likewise be latent, even in him who is now as fierce
and as uncontrollable as a volcano; while the desire to be
"head of the bureau" may slumber in the mildest of the
fair. It is by circumstance alone that talent is developed;
the razor itself requires extraneous aid to bring it to an
edge; and the tact to give direction, as well as the facility
to obey, wait to be elicited by events. Both grey-mareism
and Jerry-Sneakery are sometimes latent, and
like the derangements of Mrs. Anguish's caput, only
want shaking to manifest themselves. If some are born
to command, others must certainly have a genius for submission&mdash;we
term it a genius, submission being in many
cases rather a difficult thing.</p>

<p>That this division of qualities is full of wisdom, none
can deny. It requires both flint and steel to produce a
spark; both powder and ball to do execution; and,
though the Chinese contrive to gobble an infinity of rice
with chopsticks, yet the twofold operation of knife and
fork conduces much more to the comfort of a dinner.
Authority and obedience are the knife and fork of this
extensive banquet, the world; they are the true <i>divide
et impera;</i> that which is sliced off by the one is harpooned
by the other.</p>

<p>In this distribution, however, nature, when the "latents"
are made apparent, very frequently seems to act
with caprice. It is by no means rare to find in the form
of a man, a timid, retiring, feminine disposition, which,
in the rough encounters of existence, gives way at once,
as if, like woman, "born to be controlled." The proportions

<!-- page 19 -->

of a Hercules, valenced with the whiskers of a tiger,
often cover a heart with no more of energy and boldness
in its pulsations than the little palpitating affair which
throbs in the bosom of a maiden of bashful fifteen;
while many a lady fair, before marriage&mdash;the latent
condition&mdash;all softness and graceful humility, bears
within her breast the fiery resolution and the indomitable
will of an Alexander, a Hannibal, or a Doctor
Francia. The temperament which, had she been a
man, would, in an extended field, have made her a conqueror
of nations, or, in a more contracted one, a distinguished
thief-catching police officer, by being lodged
in a female frame renders her a Xantippe&mdash;a Napoleon
of the fireside, and pens her hapless mate, like a conquered
king, a spiritless captive in his own chimney
corner.</p>

<p>But it is plain to be seen that this apparent confusion
lies only in the distribution. There are souls enough of
all kinds in the world, but they do not always seem properly
fitted with bodies; and thus a corporal construction
may run the course of life actuated by a spirit in
every respect opposed to its capabilities; as at the
breaking up of a crowded <i>soir&eacute;e</i>, a little head waggles
home with an immense castor, while a pumpkin pate
sallies forth surmounted by a thimble; which, we take
it, is the only philosophical theory which at all accounts
for the frequent acting out of character with which
society is replete.</p>

<p>Hence arises the situation of affairs with the Pumpilions.
Pedrigo Pumpilion has the soul which legitimately
appertains to his beloved Seraphina Serena, while
Seraphina Serena Pumpilion has that which should
animate her Pedrigo. But, not being profound in their
researches, they are probably not aware of the fact, and

<!-- page 20 -->

perhaps would not know their own souls if they were to
meet them in the street; although, in all likelihood, it
was a mysterious sympathy&mdash;a yearning of each physical
individuality to be near so important a part of itself,
which brought this worthy pair together.</p>

<p>Be that, however, as it may, it is an incontrovertible
fact that, before they did come together, Pedrigo Pumpilion
thought himself quite a model of humanity; and
piqued himself upon possessing much more of the
<i>fortiter in re</i> than of the <i>suaviter in modo</i>&mdash;a mistake,
the latter quality being latent, but abundant. He dreamed
that he was brimming with valour, and fit, not only to
lead squadrons to the field, but likewise to remain with
them when they were there. At the sound of drums and
trumpets, he perked up his chin, stuck out his breast,
straightened his vertebral column, and believed that he,
Pedrigo, was precisely the individual to storm a fortress
at the head of a forlorn hope&mdash;a greater mistake. But
the greatest error of the whole troop of blunders was his
making a Pumpilion of Miss Seraphina Serena Dolce,
with the decided impression that he was, while sharing
his kingdom, to remain supreme in authority. Knowing
nothing of the theory already broached, he took her for
a feminine feminality, and yielded himself a victim to
sympathy and the general welfare. Now, in this, strictly
considered, Pedrigo had none but himself to blame;
he had seen manifestations of her spirit; the latent energy
had peeped out more than once; he had entered unexpectedly,
before being installed as "only my husband," and
found Miss Seraphina dancing the grand rigadoon on a
luckless bonnet which did not suit her fancy,&mdash;a species
of exercise whereat he marvelled; and he had likewise
witnessed her performance of the remarkable feat of
whirling a cat, which had scratched her hand, across the

<!-- page 21 -->

room by the tail, whereby the mirror was infinitesimally
divided into hom&oelig;opathic doses, and whereby pussy, the
patient, was most allopathically phlebotomised and scarified.
He likewise knew that her musical education terminated
in an operatic crash, the lady having in a fit of
impatience demolished the guitar over the head of her
teacher; but, in this instance, the mitigating plea must
be allowed that it was done because the instrument
"wouldn't play good," a perversity to which instruments,
like lessons "which won't learn," are lamentably
liable.</p>

<p>These little escapades, however, did not deter Pumpilion.
Confiding in his own talent for governing, he
liked his Seraphina none the less for her accidental displays
of energy, and smiled to think how, under his
administration, his reproving frown would cast oil upon
the waves, and how, as he repressed her irritability, he
would develope her affections, results which would both
save the crockery and increase his comforts.</p>

<p>Of the Pumpilion <i>tactique</i> in courtship some idea may
be formed from the following conversation. Pedrigo
had an intimate associate, some years his senior,&mdash;Mr.
Michael Mitts, a spare and emaciated bachelor, whose
hawk nose, crookedly set on, well represented the eccentricity
of his conclusions, while the whistling pucker in
which he generally wore his mouth betokened acidity
of mind rendered sourer by indecision. Mitts was addicted
to observation, and, engaged in the drawing of
inferences and in generalizing from individual instances,
he had, like many others, while trimming the safety
lamp of experience, suffered the time of action to pass
by unimproved. His cautiousness was so great as to
trammel up his "motive power," and, though long intending
to marry, the best part of his life had evaporated

<!-- page 22 -->

in the unproductive employment of "looking about."
His experience, therefore, had stored him with that
species of wisdom which one meets with in theoretical
wooers, and he had many learned saws at the service
of those who were bolder than himself, and
were determined to enter the pale through which he
peeped.</p>

<p>As every one in love must have a confidant, Pedrigo
had selected Mitts for that office, knowing his peculiar
talent for giving advice, and laying down rules for others
to act upon.</p>

<p>"Pedrigo," said Mitts, as he flexed his nose still further
from the right line of conformity to the usages of the
world, and slacked the drawing strings of his mouth to
get it out of pucker; "Pedrigo, if you are resolved upon
marrying this identical individual&mdash;I don't see the use, for
my part, of being in a hurry&mdash;better look about a while;
plenty more of 'em&mdash;but if you are resolved, the first
thing to be done is to make sure of her. That's undeniable.
The only diff'erence of opinion, if you won't
wait and study character&mdash;character's a noble study&mdash;is
as to the <i>modus operandi</i>. Now, the lady's not sure
because she's committed; just the contrary,&mdash;that's the
very reason she's not sure. My experience shows me
that when it's not so easy to retract, the attention,
especially that of young women, is drawn to retraction.
Somebody tells of a bird in a cage that grumbled
about being cooped up. It's clear to me that the bird
did not complain so much because it was in the cage, as
it did because it couldn't get out&mdash;that's bird nature, and
it's human nature too."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed!" responded Pumpilion, with a smile of
confidence in his own attractions, mingled, however,
with a look which spoke that the philosophy of Mitts,

<!-- page 23 -->

having for its object to render "assurance double sure,"
did not pass altogether unheeded.</p>

<p>"It's a fact," added Mitts; "don't be too secure.
Be as assiduous and as mellifluous as you please before
your divinity owns the soft impeachment; but afterwards
comes the second stage, and policy commands that it
should be one rather of anxiety to her. You must
every now and then play Captain Grand, or else she
may perform the part herself. Take offence frequently;
vary your Romeo scenes with an occasional touch of the
snow storm, and afterwards excuse yourself on the score
of jealous affection; that excuse always answers. Nothing
sharpens love like a smart tiff by way of embellishment.
The sun itself would not look so bright if it were
not for the intervention of night; and these little agitations
keep her mind tremulous, but intent upon yourself.
Don't mothers always love the naughtiest boys best?
haven't the worst men always the best wives? That
exemplifies the principle; there's nothing like a little
judicious bother. Miss Seraphina Serena will never
change her mind if bothered scientifically."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so; but may it not be rather dangerous?"</p>

<p>"Dangerous! not at all; it's regular practice, I tell
you. A few cases may terminate unluckily; but that must
be charged to a bungle in the doctor. Why, properly
managed, a courtship may be continued, like a nervous
disease, or a suit at law, for twenty years, and be as
good at the close as it was at the beginning. In nine
cases out of ten, you must either perplex or be perplexed;
so you had better take the sure course, and play the
game yourself. Them's my sentiments, Mr. Speaker,"
and Michael Mitts caused his lithe proboscis to oscillate
like a rudder, as he concluded his oracular speech, and
puckered his mouth to the whistling place to show that

<!-- page 24 -->

he had "shut up" for the present. He then walked
slowly away, leaving Pumpilion with a "new wrinkle."</p>

<p>Seraphina Serena, being both fiery and coquettish
withal, Pumpilion, under the direction of his preceptor,
tried the "Mitts system of wooing," and although it
gave rise to frequent explosions, yet the quarrels, whether
owing to the correctness of the system or not, were productive
of no lasting evil. Michael Mitts twirled his
nose and twisted his mouth in triumph at the wedding;
and set it down as an axiom that there is nothing like a
little insecurity for rendering parties firm in completing
a bargain; that, had it not been for practising the system,
Pumpilion might have become alarmed at the indications
of the "latent spirit;" and that, had it not been for the
practice of the system, Seraphina's fancy might have
strayed.</p>

<p>"I'm an experimenter in mental operations, and there's
no lack of subjects," said Mitts to himself; "one fact
being established, the Pumpilions now present a new
aspect."</p>

<p>There is, however, all the difference in the world
between carrying on warfare where you may advance
and retire at pleasure, and in prosecuting it in situations
which admit of no retreat. Partisan hostilities are one
thing, and regular warfare is another. Pumpilion was
very well as a guerilla, but his genius in that respect
was unavailing when the nature of the campaign did not
admit of his making an occasional demonstration, and of
evading the immediate consequences by a retreat. In a
very few weeks, he was reduced to the ranks as "only
my husband," and, although no direct order of the day
was read to that effect, he was "respected accordingly."
Before that retrograde promotion took place, Pedrigo

<!-- page 25 -->

Pumpilion cultivated his hair, and encouraged its sneaking
inclination to curl until it woollied up quite fiercely; but
afterwards his locks became broken-heartedly pendent,
and straight with the weight of care, while his whiskers
hung back as if asking counsel and comfort from his
ears. He twiddled his thumbs with a slow rotary motion
as he sat, and he carried his hands clasped behind him
as he walked, thus intimating that he couldn't help it,
and that he didn't mean to try. For the same reason,
he never buttoned his coat, and wore no straps to the
feet of his trousers; both of which seemed too energetically
resolute for "only my husband." Even his hat,
as it sat on the back part of his head, looked as if Mrs.
Pumpilion had put it on for him, (no one but the wearer
can put on a hat so that it will sit naturally,) and as if he
had not nerve enough even to shake it down to its characteristic
place and physiognomical expression. His <i>personnel</i>
loudly proclaimed that the Mitts method in matrimony
had been a failure, and that the Queen had given
the King a check-mate. Mrs. Pumpilion had been
triumphant in acting upon the advice of her friend, the
widow, who, having the advantage of Mitts in combining
experience with theory, understood the art of breaking
husbands <i>&agrave; merveille</i>.</p>

<p>"My dear madam," said Mrs. Margery Daw, "you
have plenty of spirit; but spirit is nothing without steadiness
and perseverance. In the establishment of authority
and in the assertion of one's rights, any intermission
before success is complete requires us to begin again.
If your talent leads you to the weeping method of softening
your husband's heart, you will find that if you give
him a shower now and a shower then, he will harden in
the intervals between the rain; while a good sullen cry
of twenty-four hours' length may prevent any necessity

<!-- page 26 -->

for another. If, on the contrary, you have genius for
the tempestuous, continued thunder and lightning for the
same length of time is irresistible. Gentlemen are great
swaggerers, if not impressively dealt with and early
taught to know their places. They are much like
Frisk," continued the widow, addressing her lap-dog.
"If they bark, and you draw back frightened, they are
sure to bite; stamp your foot, and they soon learn to run
into a corner. Don't they, Frisky dear?"</p>

<p>"Ya-p!" responded the dog: and Mrs. Pumpilion,
tired of control, took the concurrent advice.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>"To-morrow," said Pumpilion, carelessly and with
an of-course-ish air, as he returned to tea from a stroll
with his friend Michael Mitts, who had just been urging
upon him the propriety of continuing the Mitts method
after marriage, "to-morrow, my love, I leave town for
a week to try a little trout fishing in the mountains."</p>

<p>"Mr. Pumpilion!" ejaculated the lady, in an awful
tone, as she suddenly faced him. "Fishing?"</p>

<p>"Y-e-e-yes," replied Pumpilion, somewhat discomposed.</p>

<p>"Then I shall go with you, Mr. Pumpilion," said
the lady, as she emphatically split a muffin.</p>

<p>"Quite <i>on</i>possible," returned Pumpilion, with decisive
stress upon the first syllable; "it's a buck party, if
I may use the expression&mdash;a buck party entirely;&mdash;there's
Mike Mitts, funny Joe Mungoozle&mdash;son of old
Mungoozle's,&mdash;Tommy Titcomb, and myself. We intend
having a rough and tumble among the hills to beneficialise
our wholesomes, as funny Joe Mungoozle has it."</p>

<p>"Funny Joe Mungoozle is not a fit companion for any
married man, Mr. Pumpilion; and it's easy to see, by
your sliding back among the dissolute friends and dissolute

<!-- page 27 -->

practices of your bachelorship, Mr. Pumpilion&mdash;by
your wish to associate with sneering and depraved Mungoozles,
Mitts's, and Titcombs, Mr. Pumpilion, that the
society of your poor wife is losing its attractions," and
Mrs. Pumpilion sobbed convulsively at the thought.</p>

<p>"I have given my word to go a fishing," replied
Pedrigo, rather ruefully, "and a fishing I must go.
What would Mungoozle say?&mdash;why, he would have a
song about it, and sing it at the 'free and easies.' "</p>

<p>"What matter? let him say&mdash;let him sing. But it's
not my observations&mdash;it's those of funny Joe Mungoozle
that you care for&mdash;the affections of the 'free and easy'
carousers that you are afraid of losing."</p>

<p>"Mungoozle is a very particular friend of mine, Seraphina,"
replied Pedrigo, rather nettled. "We're going
a fishing&mdash;that's flat!"</p>

<p>"Without me?"</p>

<p>"Without you,&mdash;it being a buck party, without exception."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pumpilion gave a shriek, and falling back, threw
out her arms fitfully&mdash;the tea-pot went by the board, as
she made the tragic movement.</p>

<p>"Wretched, unhappy woman!" gasped Mrs. Pumpilion,
speaking of herself.</p>

<p>Pedrigo did not respond to the declaration, but alternately
eyed the fragments of the tea-pot and the untouched
muffin which remained on his plate. The <i>coup</i>
had not been without its effect; but still he faintly whispered,
"Funny Joe Mungoozle, and going a fishing."</p>

<p>"It's clear you wish to kill me&mdash;to break my heart,"
muttered the lady in a spasmodic manner.</p>

<p>" 'Pon my soul, I don't&mdash;I'm only going a fishing."</p>

<p>"I shall go distracted!" screamed Mrs. Pumpilion,
suiting the action to the word, and springing to her feet

<!-- page 28 -->

in such a way as to upset the table, and roll its contents
into Pedrigo's lap, who scrambled from the <i>debris</i>, as
his wife, with the air of the Pythoness, swept rapidly
round the room, whirling the ornaments to the floor, and
indulging in the grand rigadoon upon their sad remains.</p>

<p>"You no longer love me, Pedrigo; and without your
love what is life? What is this, or this, or this," continued
she, a crash following every word, "without mutual
affection?&mdash;Going a fishing!"</p>

<p>"I don't know that I am," whined Pumpilion. "Perhaps
it will rain to-morrow."</p>

<p>Now it so happened that there were no clouds visible
on the occasion, except in the domestic atmosphere; but,
the rain was adroitly thrown in as a white flag, indicative
of a wish to open a negotiation and come to terms,
Mrs. Pumpilion, however, understood the art of war better
than to treat with rebels with arms in their hands.
Her military genius, no longer "latent," whispered her
to persevere until she obtained a surrender at discretion.</p>

<p>"Ah, Pedrigo, you only say that to deceive your
heart-broken wife. You intend to slip away&mdash;you and
your Mungoozles&mdash;to pass your hours in roaring iniquity,
instead of enjoying the calm sunshine of domestic
peace, and the gentle delights of fireside felicity. They
are too tame, too flat, too insipid for a depraved taste.
That I should ever live to see the day!" and she relapsed
into the intense style by way of a specimen of calm delight.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Pumpilion retired for the night at an
early hour; but until the dawn of day, the words of reproach,
now passionate, now pathetic, ceased not; and
in the very gray of the morning, Mrs. P. marched down
stairs <i>en dishabille</i>, still repeating ejaculations about the
Mungoozle fishing party. What happened below is not

<!-- page 29 -->

precisely ascertained; but there was a terrible turmoil in
the kitchen, it being perfectly clear a whole "kettle of
fish" was in preparation, that Pedrigo might not have the
trouble of going to the mountains on a piscatorial expedition.</p>

<p>He remained seated on the side of the bed, like Marius
upon the ruins of Carthage, meditating upon the
situation of affairs, and balancing between a surrender to
petticoat government and his dread of Mongoozle's song
at the "free and easies." At length he slipped down.
Mrs. Pumpilion sat glooming at the parlour window.
Pedrigo tried to read the "Saturday News" upside
down.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Pumpilion! Going a fishing,
Mr. Pumpilion! Mike Mitts, funny Joe Mungoozle, and
Tommy Titcomb must be waiting for you&mdash;you know,"
continued she with a mocking smile, "you're to go this
morning to the mountains on a rough and tumble for the
benefit of your wholesomes. The elegance of the phraseology
is quite in character with the whole affair."</p>

<p>Pedrigo was tired out; Mrs. Margery Daw's perseverance
prescription had been too much for the Mitts
method; the widow had overmatched the bachelor.</p>

<p>"No, Seraphina my dearest, I'm not going a fishing,
if you don't desire it, and I see you don't."</p>

<p>Not a word about its being likely to rain&mdash;the surrender
was unconditional.</p>

<p>"But," added Pedrigo, "I should like to have a little
breakfast."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pumpilion was determined to clinch the nail.</p>

<p>"There's to be no breakfast here&mdash;I've been talking
to Sally and Tommy in the kitchen, and I verily believe
the whole world's in a plot against me. They're gone,
Mr. Pumpilion&mdash;gone a fishing, perhaps."</p>

<!-- page 30 -->

<p>The battle was over&mdash;the victory was won&mdash;the nail
was clinched. Tealess, sleepless, breakfastless, what
could Pedrigo do but sue for mercy, and abandon a contest
waged against such hopeless odds? The supplies
being cut off, the siege-worn garrison must surrender.
After hours of solicitation, the kiss of amity was reluctantly
accorded; on condition, however, that "funny Joe
Mungoozle" and the rest of the fishing party should be
given up, and that he, Pedrigo, for the future should
refrain from associating with bachelors and widowers,
both of whom she <i>tabooed</i>, and consort with none but
staid married men.</p>

<p>From this moment the individuality of that once free
agent, Pedrigo Pumpilion, was sunk into "only my husband"&mdash;the
humblest of all humble animals. He fetches
and carries, goes errands, and lugs band-boxes and bundles;
he walks the little Pumpilions up and down the
room when they squall o' nights, and he never comes in
when any of his wife's distinguished friends call to visit
her. In truth, Pedrigo is not always in a presentable
condition; for as Mrs. Pumpilion is <i>de facto</i> treasurer,
he is kept upon rather short allowance, her wants being
paramount and proportioned to the dignity of head of the
family. But, although he is now dutiful enough, he at
first ventured once or twice to be refractory. These
symptoms of insubordination, however, were soon
quelled&mdash;for Mrs. Pumpilion, with a significant glance,
inquired,&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Are you going a fishing again, my dear?</i>"</p>

<p>ORSON DABBS, THE HITTITE.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>IT has been said, and truly, that it takes all sorts of
people to make a world. He who complains of the lights
and shades of character which are eternally flitting before
him, and of the diversity of opposing interests
which at times cross his path, has but an illiberal, contracted
view of the subject; and though the Emperor
Charles the Fifth, in his retirement at Estremadura, had
some reason for being a little annoyed when he could not
cause two or three score of watches to go together, yet
he was wrong in sighing over his previous ineffectual
efforts to make men think alike. It is, to speak figuratively,
the clashing which constitutes the music. The
harmony of the whole movement is produced by the
fusion into each other of an infinite variety of petty discords;
as a glass of punch depends for its excellence upon
the skilful commingling of opposing flavours and antagonising
materials. Were the passengers in a wherry to
be of one mind, they would probably all sit upon the
same side, and hence, naturally, pay a visit to the Davy
Jones of the river; and if all the men of a nation thought
alike, it is perfectly evident that the ship of state must
lose her trim. The system of checks and balances pervades
both the moral and the physical world, and without
it, affairs would soon hasten to their end. It is, therefore,
clear that we must have all sorts of people,&mdash;some to prevent
stagnation, and others to act as ballast to an excess

<!-- page 32 -->

of animation. The steam engines of humanity must have
their brakes and their safety valves, and the deadweights
of society require the whip and the spur.</p>

<p>Orson Dabbs certainly is entitled to a place among the
stimulants of the world, and it is probable that in exercising
his impulses, he produces beneficial effects. But it
would puzzle a philosopher to designate the wholesome
results which follow from his turbulent movements, or
to show, either by synthesis or analysis, wherein he is
a good. At all events, Orson Dabbs has the reputation
of being a troublesome fellow in the circles upon which
he inflicts himself; and, judging from the evidence elicited
upon the subject, there is little reason to doubt the
fact. He is dogmatical, and to a certain extent fond of
argument; but when a few sharp words will not make
converts, he abandons those windy weapons with contempt,
and has recourse to more forcible persuaders&mdash;a
pair of fists, each of which looks like a shoulder of
mutton.</p>

<p>"If people are so obstinate that they won't, or so
stupid that they can't understand you," observed Dabbs,
in one of his confidential moments&mdash;for Orson Dabbs
will sometimes unbend, and suffer those abstruse maxims
which govern his conduct to escape&mdash;"if either for one
reason or the other," continued he, with that impressive
iteration which at once gives time to collect and marshal
one's thoughts, and lets the listener know that something
of moment is coming&mdash;"if they won't be convinced&mdash;easily
and genteelly convinced&mdash;you must knock it into
'em short hand; if they can't comprehend, neither by
due course of mail, nor yet by express, you must make
'em understand by telegraph. That's the way I learnt
ciphering at school, and manners and genteel behaviour
at home. All I know was walloped into me. I took

<!-- page 33 -->

larnin' through the skin, and sometimes they made a good
many holes to get it in."</p>

<p>"And," timidly interjected an humble admirer of this
great man, hazarding a joke, with an insinuating smile;
"and I s'pose you're so wise now because the hide
growed over it, and the larnin' couldn't get out, like Ingey
ink in a sailor's arm."</p>

<p>"Jeames," replied Orson Dabbs, relaxing into a grim
smile, like that of the griffin face of a knocker, and
shaking his "bunch of fives" sportively, as one snaps an
unloaded gun&mdash;Napoleon tweaked the ears of his courtiers&mdash;why
should not Dabbs shake his fist at his satellites?&mdash;"Jeames,
if you don't bequit poking fun at me,
I'll break your mouth, Jeames, as sure as you sit there.
But, to talk sensible, walloping is the only way&mdash;it's a
panacea for differences of opinion. You'll find it in history
books, that one nation teaches another what it didn't
know before by walloping it; that's the method of civilizing
savages&mdash;the Romans put the whole world to rights
that way; and what's right on the big figger must be
right on the small scale. In short, there's nothing like
walloping for taking the conceit out of fellows who think
they know more than their betters. Put it to 'em strong,
and make 'em see out of their eyes."</p>

<p>Orson Dabbs acts up to these golden maxims. Seeing
that, from disputes between dogs up to quarrels between
nations, fighting is the grand umpire and regulator, he
resolves all power into that of the fist,&mdash;treating bribery,
reason, and persuasion as the means only of those
unfortunate individuals to whom nature has denied the
stronger attributes of humanity. Nay, he even turns up
his nose at betting as a means of discovering truth.
Instead of stumping an antagonist by launching out his
cash, Dabbs shakes a portentous fist under his nose, and

<!-- page 34 -->

the affair is settled; the recusant must either knock under
or be knocked down, which, according to our hero, is all
the same in Dutch. In this way, when politics ran
high, he used to decide who was to be elected to any
specified office; and he has often boasted that he once, in
less than five minutes too, scared a man into giving the
Dabbs candidate a large majority, when the unfortunate
stranger did not at first believe that the said candidate
would be elected at all.</p>

<p>Some people believe that the fist is the poorest of
arguments, and that it, therefore, should be the last.
Here they are completely at issue with Dabbs, and it is
well that they do not fall in his way, or he would soon
show them the difference. With him it is what action
was to the ancient orator, the first, the middle, and the
last. Being himself, in a great measure, fist proof, he
is very successful in the good work of proselytism, and
has quite a reputation as a straightforward reasoner and
a forcible dialectitian.</p>

<p>Misfortunes, however, will sometimes happen to the
most successful. The loftiest nose may be brought to
the grindstone, and the most scornful dog may be obliged
to lunch upon dirty pudding. Who can control his fate?
One night Mr. Dabbs came home from his "loafing"
place&mdash;for he "loafs" of an evening, like the generality
of people&mdash;that being the most popular and the cheapest
amusement extant; and, from the way he blurted open
the door of the Goose and Gridiron, where he resides,
and from the more unequivocal manner in which he slammed
it after him, no doubt existed in the minds of his
fellow boarders that the well of his good spirits had been
"riled;" or, in more familiar phrase, that he was
"spotty on the back." His hat was pitched forward,
with a bloodthirsty, piratical rakishness, and almost

<!-- page 35 -->

covered his eyes, which gleamed like ignited charcoal
under a jeweller's blowpipe. His cheeks were flushed
with an angry spot, and his nose&mdash;always a quarrelsome
pug&mdash;curled more fiercely upward, as if the demon wrath
had turned archer, and was using it for a bow to draw
an arrow to its head. His mouth had set in opposition
to his nasal promontory, and savagely curved downward,
like a half-moon battery. Dabbs was decidedly out of
sorts&mdash;perhaps beery, as well as wolfy; in short, in that
unenviable state in which a man feels disposed to divide
himself, and go to buffets&mdash;to kick himself with his own
foot&mdash;to beat himself with his own fist, and to throw his
own dinner out of the window.</p>

<p>The company were assembled round the fire to discuss
politics, literature, men, and things. Dabbs looked
not at them, but, slinging Tommy Timid's bull terrier
Oseola out of the arm-chair in the corner, by the small
stump of a tail which fashion and the hatchet had left the
animal, he sat himself moodily down, with a force that
made the timbers creak. The conversation was turning
upon a recent brilliant display of the aurora borealis,
which the more philosophical of the party supposed to
arise from the north pole having become red-hot for
want of grease; while they all joined in deriding the popular
fallacy that it was caused by the high price of flour.</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Dabbs, with a grunt, "any fool
might know that it was a sign of war."</p>

<p>"War!" ejaculated the party; "oh, your granny!"</p>

<p>"Yes, war!" roared Dabbs, kicking the bull terrier
Oseola in the ribs, and striking the table a tremendous
blow with his fist, as, with clenched teeth and out-poked
head, he repeated, "War! war! war!"</p>

<p>Now the Goose and Gridiron fraternity set up for
knowing geniuses, and will not publicly acknowledge

<!-- page 36 -->

faith in the doctrines on meteorology broached by their
grandmothers, whatever they may think in private. So
they quietly remarked, confiding in their numbers against
the Orson Dabbs method of conversion, that the aurora
was not a sign of war, but an evidence of friction and
of no grease on the axle of the world.</p>

<p>"That's a lie!" shouted Dabbs; "my story's the true
one, for I read it in an almanac; and to prove it true,
I'll lick anybody here that don't believe it, in two cracks
of a cow's thumb. Yes," added he, in reply to the looks
bent upon him; "I'll not only wallop them that don't
believe it, but I'll wallop you all, whether you do or
not!"</p>

<p>This, however, was a stretch of benevolence to which
the company were not prepared to submit. As Dabbs
squared off to proceed <i>secundum artem</i>, according to the
approved method of the schools, the watchful astrologer
might have seen his star grow pale. He had reached
his Waterloo&mdash;that winter night was his 18th of June.
He fell, as many have fallen before him, by that implicit
reliance on his own powers which made him forgetful
of the risk of encountering the long odds. The threat
was too comprehensive, and the attempt at execution
was a failure. The company cuffed him heartily, and
in the fray the bull terrier Oseola vented its cherished
wrath by biting a piece out of the fleshiest portion of his
frame. Dabbs was ousted by a summary process, but
his heart did not fail him. He thundered at the door,
sometimes with his fists, and again with whatever missiles
were within reach. The barking of the dog and the
laughter from within, as was once remarked of certain
military heroes, did not "intimate him in the least,
it only estimated him."</p>

<p>The noise at last became so great that a watchman

<!-- page 37 -->

finally summoned up resolution enough to come near,
and to take Dabbs by the arm.</p>

<p>"Let go, watchy!&mdash;let go, my cauliflower! Your
cocoa is very near a sledge-hammer. If it isn't hard, it
may get cracked."</p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh! don't be onasy, my darlint&mdash;my
cocoa is a corporation cocoa&mdash;it belongs to the city, and
they'll get me a new one. Besides, my jewel, there's
two cocoas standing here, you know. Don't be onasy&mdash;it
mayn't be mine that will get cracked."</p>

<p>"I ain't onasy," said Dabbs, bitterly, as he turned
fiercely round. "I ain't onasy. I only want to caution
you, or I'll upset your apple cart, and spill your peaches."</p>

<p>"I'm not in the wegetable way, my own-self, Mr.
Horse-radish. You must make less noise."</p>

<p>"Now, look here&mdash;look at me well," said Dabbs, striking
his fist hard upon his own bosom; "I'm a real nine
foot breast of a fellow&mdash;stub twisted and made of horse-shoe
nails&mdash;the rest of me is cast iron with steel springs.
I'll stave my fist right through you, and carry you on
my elbow, as easily as if you were an empty market
basket&mdash;I will&mdash;bile me up for soap if I don't!"</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed! why, you must be a real Calcutta-from-Canting,
warranted not to cut in the eye. Snakes is no
touch to you; but I'm sorry to say you must knuckle
down close. You must surrender; there's no help for
it&mdash;none in the world."</p>

<p>"Square yourself then, for I'm coming! Don't you
hear the clockvorks!" exclaimed Dabbs, as he shook
off the grip of the officer, and struck an attitude.</p>

<p>He stood beautifully; feet well set; guard well up;
admirable science, yet fearful to look upon. Like the
Adriatic, Dabbs was "lovelily dreadful" on this exciting
occasion. But when "Greek meets Greek," fierce looks

<!-- page 38 -->

and appalling circumstances amount to nothing. The
opponent of our hero, after regarding him coolly for a
moment, whistled with great contempt, and with provoking
composure, beat down his guard with a smart blow
from a heavy mace, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'Taint no use, no how&mdash;you're all used up for bait."</p>

<p>"Ouch!" shrieked Dabbs; "my eye, how it hurts!
Don't hit me again. Ah, good man, but you're a bruiser.
One, two, three, from you would make a person believe
any thing, even if he was sure it wasn't true."</p>

<p>"Very well," remarked the <i>macerator</i>, "all I want
of you is to behave nice and genteel, and believe you're
going to the watch'us, for it's true; and if you don't
believe it yet, why (shaking his mace) I shall feel
obligated to conwince you again."</p>

<p>As this was arguing with him after his own method,
and as Dabbs had distinct impressions of the force of
the reasoning, he shrugged his shoulders, and then
rubbing his arms, muttered, "Enough said."</p>

<p>He trotted off quietly for the first time in his life.
Since the affair and its consequences have passed away,
he has been somewhat chary of entering into the field of
argument, and particularly careful not to drink too much
cold water, for fear the bull terrier before referred to was
mad, and dreading hydrophobic convulsions.</p>

<p>ROCKY SMALT;</p>

<p class="small">OR, THE DANGERS OF IMITATION.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>MAN is an imitative animal, and so strong is the
instinctive feeling to follow in the footsteps of others,
that he who is so fortunate as to strike out a new path
must travel rapidly, if he would avoid being run down by
imitators, and preserve the merit of originality. If his
discovery be a good one, the "<i>servum pecus</i>" will sweep
toward it like an avalanche; and so quick will be their
motion, that the daring spirit who first had the self-reliance
to turn from the beaten track, is in danger of
being lost among the crowd, and of having his claim to
the honours of a discoverer doubted and derided. Turn
where you will, the imitative propensity is to be
found busily at work; its votaries clustering round the
falcon to obtain a portion of the quarry which the nobler
bird has stricken; and perhaps, like Sir John Falstaff,
to deal the prize a "new wound in the thigh," and
falsely claim the wreath of victory. In the useful arts,
there are thousands of instances in which the real discoverer
has been thrust aside to give place to the imitator;
and in every other branch in which human ingenuity
has been exercised, if the flock of copyists do not
obtain the patent right of fame, they soon, where it is
practicable, wear out the novelty, and measurably deprive

<!-- page 40 -->

the inventor of the consideration to which he is entitled.
In the apportionment of applause, the praise too often
depends upon which is first seen, the statue or the cast&mdash;although
the one be marble, and the other plaster.</p>

<p>In business, no one can hope to recommend his wares
to patronage in a new and taking way, no matter what
outlay of thought has been required for its invention,
without finding multitudes prompt in the adoption of
the same device. He who travels by a fresh and verdant
path in literature, and is successful, soon hears the
murmurs of a pursuing troop, and has his by-way converted
into a dusty turnpike, macadamized on the principle
of "writing made easy;" while, on the stage, the
drama groans with great ones at second-hand. The
illustrious in tragedy can designate an army of those,
who, unable to retail their beauties, strive for renown by
exaggerating their defects; and Thalia has even seen her
female aids cut off their flowing locks, and teach themselves
to wriggle, because she who was in fashion wore
a crop, and had adopted a gait after her own fancy.</p>

<p>It is to this principle that a professional look is attributable.
In striving to emulate the excellence of another,
the student thinks he has made an important step if he
can catch the air, manner, and tone of his model; and
believes that he is in a fair way to acquire equal wisdom,
if he can assume the same expression of the face, and
compass the same "hang of the nether lip." We have
seen a pupil endeavouring to help himself onward in
the race for distinction by wearing a coat similar in cut
and colour to that wherewith his preceptor indued
himself; and we remember the time when whole classes
at a certain eastern university became a regiment of
ugly Dromios, lengthening their visages, and smoothing
their hair down to their eyes, for no other reason than

<!-- page 41 -->

that an eminent and popular professor chose to display
his frontispiece after that fashion&mdash;and that, as they
emulated his literary abilities, they, therefore, thought it
advantageous to imitate his personal defects. When
Byron's fame was in the zenith, poetic scribblers dealt
liberally in shirt collar, and sported an expanse of neck;
and when Waterloo heroes were the wonders of the
hour, every town in England could show its limpers and
hobblers, who, innocent of war, would fain have passed
for men damaged by the French. On similar grounds,
humps, squints, impediments of speech, mouths awry,
and limbs distorted, have been the rage.</p>

<p>How then could Orson Dabbs, the Hittite, admired
and peculiar as he was, both for his ways and for his
opinions, hope to escape imitation? If he entertained
such a belief, it was folly; and if he dreamed that he
could so thump the world as to preserve his originality,
it was a mere delusion. Among the many who frequented
the Goose and Gridiron, where Orson resided,
was one Rocky Smalt, whose early admiration
for the great one it is beyond the power of words to
utter, though subsequent events converted that admiration
into hostility. Rocky Smalt had long listened with
delight to Orson's lectures upon the best method of
removing difficulties, which, according to him, is by
thumping them down, as a paviour smooths the streets;
and as Orson descanted, and shook his fists in exemplification
of the text, the soul of Rocky, like a bean in a
bottle, swelled within him to put these sublime doctrines
in practice.</p>

<p>Now, it unluckily happens that Rocky Smalt is a
very little man&mdash;one of the feather weights&mdash;which
militates somewhat against the gratification of his pugilistic
desires, insomuch that if he "squares off" at a big

<!-- page 42 -->

fellow, he is obliged, in dealing a facer, to hit his antagonist
on the knee; and a blow given there, everybody
knows, neither "bungs a peeper" nor "taps a smeller."
But Rocky, being to a certain degree aware of his gladiatorial
deficiencies, is rather theoretical than practical;
that is, he talks much more than he battles. His narratives,
differing from himself, are colossal; and as Colossus
stood with one foot on one side, and with the other
foot on the other side, so do Rocky's speeches refer to
the past and to the future&mdash;to what he has done, and to
what he means to do. He is now retrospective, and
again prospective, in talking of personal contention, his
combats never being present, which is by far the most
agreeable method of obtaining reputation, as we thereby
avoid the inconvenience of pricking our fingers in gathering
glory.</p>

<p>Rocky, in copying Dabbs as to his belligerent principles,
is likewise careful to do the same, as far as it is
possible, in relation to personal appearance. He is,
therefore, a pocket Dabbs&mdash;a miniature Orson. He
cultivates whiskers to the apex of the chin; and although
they are not very luxuriant, they make up in length
what they want in thickness. He cocks his hat fiercely,
rolls in his gait, and, with doubled fists, carries his arms
in the muscular curve, elbows pointing outward, and
each arm forming the segment of a circle. He slams
doors after him, kicks little dogs, and swears at little
boys, as Orson does. If any one runs against him, he
waits until the offender is out of hearing, and then
denounces him in the most energetic expletives belonging
to the language, and is altogether a vinaigrette of
wrath. It is the combat only that bothers Smalt; if it
were not for that link in the chain of progression from
defiance to victory, he would indeed be a most truculent

<!-- page 43 -->

hero, and deserve a salary from all the nose menders
about town, whether natural bone-setters or gristle-tinkers
by commission&mdash;were it not for that, Larrey's Military
Surgery would be in continual demand, as a guide to the
cure of contusions, and so great would be the application
of oysters to the eye, that there would be a scarcity of
shell-fish.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, Smalt's flaming ardour precipitates
him into a quarrel; but, even then, he manages
matters very adroitly, by selecting the largest individual
of the opposite faction for his antagonist.</p>

<p>"Come on!" shrieks Smalt, in such an emergency;
"come on! I'll lick any thing near my own weight. I'll
chaw up any indewidooal that's fairly my match&mdash;yes,
and give him ten pounds. I ain't petickelar, when it's
a matter of accommodation. Whe-e-w! fire away!"</p>

<p>But, as Rocky's weight is just ninety-four pounds,
counting boots, hat, dead-latch key, pennies, fips, clothes,
and a little bit of cavendish, he is certain to escape; for
even the most valiant may be excused from encountering
the long odds in a pitched battle, although he may sometimes
run against them in a crowded chance-medley.
Rocky, therefore, puts on his coat again, puffing and
blowing like a porpoise, as he walks vapouring about, and
repeating with an occasional attitude <i>a la</i> Orson Dabbs,
"Any thing in reason&mdash;and a little chucked in to accommodate&mdash;when
I'm wound up, it 'most takes a stone wall to
stop me, for I go right through the timber&mdash;that's me!"</p>

<p>Yet these happy days of theoretical championship at
length were clouded. Science avails nothing against
love: Dan Cupid laughs at sparring, and beats down the
most perfect guard. It so fell out that Orson Dabbs and
Rocky Smalt both were smitten with the tender passion
at the same time, the complaint perhaps being epidemic

<!-- page 44 -->

at the season. This, however, though individually
troublesome, as the disorder is understood to be a sharp
one, would not have been productive of discord between
them, had it not unluckily happened that they became
enamoured of the same "fair damosel." Two warriors
and but one lady!&mdash;not one lady <i>per</i> piece, to speak
commercially, but one lady <i>per</i> pair. This was embarrassing&mdash;this
was dangerous. Miss Araminta Stycke&mdash;or
Miss Mint Stycke, as she was sometimes more sweetly
termed&mdash;could not, according to legal enactments, marry
both the gentlemen in question; and as each was determined
to have her entire, the situation was decidedly perplexing,
essentially bothering, and effectively dramatic,
which, however amusing to the looker-on, is the <i>ne plus
ultra</i> of discomfort to those who form the tableau. Miss
Araminta could doubtless have been very "happy with
either, were t'other dear charmer away;" but this was
out of the question; for, when Dabbs on one side stuck
to Stycke, Smalt on the other side just as assiduously
stuck to Stycke, and both stickled stoutly for her
smiles.</p>

<p>"My dear Mint Stycke," said Rocky Smalt, at a tea
party, taking hold of a dish of plums nicely done in molasses&mdash;"my
dear Mint Stycke, allow me to help you to
a small few of the goodies."</p>

<p>"Minty, my darling!" observed Dabbs, who sat on
her left hand. Rocky being on the right&mdash;"Minty my
darling," repeated Dabbs, with that dashing familiarity
so becoming in a majestic personage, as he stretched
forth his hand, and likewise grasped the dish of plums,
"I insist upon helping you myself."</p>

<p>The consequence was an illustration of the <i>embarras</i>
of having two lovers on the ground at the same time.
The plums were spilt in such a way as to render Miss

<!-- page 45 -->

Stycke sweeter that ever, by giving "sweets to the
sweet;" but the young lady was by no means so pretty
to look at as she had been before the ceremony.</p>

<p>"Of the twain, she most affected" Dabbs, of which
Rocky was not a little jealous.</p>

<p>"Minty, I don't care for Dabbs," said Rocky, in heroic
tones; "big as he is, if he comes here too often a crossing
me, he'll ketch it. I'll thump him, Minty, I will&mdash;feed
me on hay, if I don't."</p>

<p>Minty laughed, and well she might, for just then Orson
arrived, and, walking into the room, scowled fiercely at
Smalt, who suddenly remembered "he had to go somewheres,
and promised to be there early&mdash;he must go, as
it was a'most late now."</p>

<p>"He thump me!" said Dabbs, with a supercilious
smile, when Minty repeated the threat. "The next time
I meet that chap, I'll take my stick and kill it&mdash;I'll sqush
it with my foot."</p>

<p>Unhappily for the serenity of his mind, Rocky Smalt
had his ear at the key hole when this awful threat was
made, and he quaked to hear it, not doubting that Dabbs
would be as good as his word. He, therefore, fled <i>instanter</i>,
and roamed about like a perturbed spirit; now travelling
quickly&mdash;anon pausing to remember the frightful
words, and, as they rushed vividly to mind, he would
hop-scotch convulsively and dart off like an arrow, the
whole being done in a style similar to that of a fish which
has indulged in a frolic upon <i>cocculus indicus</i>. In the
course of his eccentric rambles, he stopped in at various
places, and, either from that cause, or some other which
has not been ascertained, he waxed valiant a little after
midnight. But, as his spirits rose, his locomotive propensity
appeared to decrease, and he, at length, sat down
on a step.</p>

<!-- page 46 -->

<p>"So!" soliloquized our hero: "he intends to belt me,
does he? Take a stick&mdash;sqush with his foot&mdash;and calls
me 'it'&mdash;'it' right before Minty! Powers of wengeance,
settle on my fist, take aim with my knuckles, and shoot
him in the eye! If I wasn't so tired, and if I hadn't a
little touch of my family disorder, I'd start after him. I'd
go and dun him for the hiding; and if he'd only squat, or
let me stand on a chair, I'd give him a receipt in full,
right in the face, under my own hand and seal. I'd
knock him this-er way, and I'd whack him that-er way,
till you couldn't tell which end of his head his face
was on."</p>

<p>Smalt suited the action to the word, and threw out his
blows, right and left, with great vigour.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, he felt a heavy hand grasp his
shoulder, and give him a severe shake, while a deep gruff
voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Halloo! what the deuse are you about? You'll tear
your coat."</p>

<p>"Ah!" ejaculated Smalt, with a convulsive start;
"oh, don't! I holler enough!"</p>

<p>"Why, little 'un, you must be cracked, if you flunk
out before we begin. Holler enough, indeed! nobody's
guv' you any yet."</p>

<p>"Ah!" gasped Smalt, turning round; "I took you
for Orson Dabbs. I promised, when I cotch'd him, to
give him a licking, and I was werry much afeard I'd
have to break the peace. Breaking the peace is a werry
disagreeable thing fur to do; but I must&mdash;I'm conshensis
about it&mdash;when I ketches Orson. Somebody ought to
tell him to keep out of the way, fur fear I'll have to break
the peace."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't do to kick up a row&mdash;but I'm thinking
it would be a little <i>piece</i>, if you could break it. I'll

<!-- page 47 -->

carry home all the pieces you break off, in my waistcoat
pocket. You're only a pocket piece yourself."</p>

<p>"Nobody asked your opinions&mdash;go 'way. I've got a
job of thinking to do, and I musn't be disturbed&mdash;talking
puts me out. Paddle, steamboat, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take keer&mdash;don't persume," was the impressive
reply; "I'm a 'fishal functionary out a ketching of dogs.
You musn't cut up because it's night. The mayor and
the 'squires have gone to bed; but the law is a thing
that never gets asleep. After ten o'clock, the law is a
watchman and a dog ketcher&mdash;we're the whole law till
breakfast's a'most ready."</p>

<p>"You only want bristles to be another sort of a whole
animal," muttered Smalt.</p>

<p>"Whew! confound your little kerkus, what do you
mean? I'd hit you unofficially, if there was any use in
pegging at a fly."</p>

<p>Smalt began to feel uneasy; so, taking the hint conveyed
in the word fly, he made a spring as the commencement
of a retreat from one who talked so fiercely
and so disrespectfully. But he had miscalculated his
powers. After running a few steps, his apprehensions
overthrew him, and his persecutor walking up, said:</p>

<p>"Oh! you stumpy little peace-breaker, I knows what
you have been about&mdash;you've been drinking."</p>

<p>"You <i>nose</i> it, hey?&mdash;much good may it do you.
Can't a man wet his whistle without your nosing it?"</p>

<p>"No, you can't&mdash;it's agin the law, which is very full
upon this pint."</p>

<p>"Pint! Not the half of it&mdash;I haven't got the stowage
room."</p>

<p>The "ketcher" laughed, for, notwithstanding their
sanguinary profession, ketchers, like Lord Norbury, are
said to love a joke, and to indulge in merriment, whenever

<!-- page 48 -->

the boys are not near. He therefore picked up
Smalt, and placing him upon his knee, remarked as
follows:</p>

<p>"You're a clever enough kind of little feller, sonny;
but you ain't been eddicated to the law as I have; so I'll
give you a lecture. Justice vinks at vot it can't see, and
lets them off vot it can't ketch. When you want to break
it, you must dodge. You may do what you like in your
own house, and the law don't know nothing about the
matter. But never go thumping and bumping about
the streets, when you are primed and snapped. That's
intemperance, and the other is temperance. But now you
come under the muzzle of the ordinance&mdash;you're a
loafer."</p>

<p>"Now, look here&mdash;I'll tell you the truth. Orson
Dabbs swears he'll belt me&mdash;yes, he calls me 'it'&mdash;he
said he'd sqush me with his foot&mdash;he'd take a stick and
kill 'it'&mdash;me, I mean. What am I to do?&mdash;there'll be a
fight, and Dabbs will get hurt."</p>

<p>"He can't do what he says&mdash;the law declares he
musn't; and if he does, it isn't any great matter&mdash;he'll
be put in limbo, you know."</p>

<p>This, however, was a species of comfort which had
very little effect upon Smalt. He cared nothing about
what might be done with Orson Dabbs after Orson had
done for him.</p>

<p>His new friend, however, proved, as Smalt classically
remarked, to be like a singed cat, much better than he
looked, for he conducted the Lilliputian hero home, and,
bundling him into the entry, left him there in comfort.
Rocky afterwards removed to another part of the town,
for the purpose of keeping clear of his enemy, and, with
many struggles, yielded the palm in relation to Miss
Araminta Stycke, who soon became Mrs. Orson Dabbs.

<!-- page 49 -->

After this event, Rocky Smalt, who is not above the
useful employment of gathering a little wisdom from
experience, changed his system, and now speaks belligerently
only in reference to the past, his gasconading
stories invariably beginning, "A few years ago, when I
was a fighting carackter."</p>

<p>UNDEVELOPED GENIUS.</p>

<p class="small">A PASSAGE IN THE LIFE OF P. PILGARLICK
PIGWIGGEN, ESQ.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>THE world has heard much of unwritten music, and
more of unpaid debts; a brace of unsubstantialities, in
which very little faith is reposed. The minor poets
have twangled their lyres about the one, until the sound
has grown wearisome, and until, for the sake of peace and
quietness, we heartily wish that unwritten music were
fairly written down, and published in Willig's or Blake's
best style, even at the risk of hearing it reverberate from
every piano in the city: while iron-visaged creditors&mdash;all
creditors are of course hard, both in face and in
heart, or they would not ask for their money&mdash;have
chattered of unpaid debts, ever since the flood, with a wet
finger, was uncivil enough to wipe out pre-existing scores,
and extend to each skulking debtor the "benefit of the
act." But <i>undeveloped genius</i>, which is, in fact, itself
unwritten music, and is very closely allied to unpaid
debts, has, as yet, neither poet, trumpeter, nor biographer.
Gray, indeed, hinted at it in speaking of "village Hampdens,"
"mute inglorious Miltons," and "Cromwells
guiltless," which showed him to be man of some discernment,
and possessed of inklings of the truth. But
the general science of mental geology, and through that,
the equally important details of mental mineralogy and

<!-- page 51 -->

mental metallurgy, to ascertain the unseen substratum
of intellect, and to determine its innate wealth, are as
yet unborn; or, if phrenology be admitted as a branch
of these sciences, are still in uncertain infancy. Undeveloped
genius, therefore, is still undeveloped, and is
likely to remain so, unless this treatise should awaken
some capable and intrepid spirit to prosecute an investigation
at once so momentous and so interesting. If not,
much of it will pass through the world undiscovered and
unsuspected; while the small remainder can manifest
itself in no other way than by the aid of a convulsion,
turning its possessor inside out like a glove; a method,
which the earth itself was ultimately compelled to adopt,
that stupid man might be made to see what treasures
are to be had for the digging.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why genius so often remains
invisible. The owner is frequently unconscious of the
jewel in his possession, and is indebted to chance for
the discovery. Of this, Patrick Henry was a striking
instance. After he had failed as a shopkeeper, and was
compelled to "hoe corn and dig potatoes," alone on his
little farm, to obtain a meagre subsistence for his family,
he little dreamed that he had that within, which would
enable him to shake the throne of a distant tyrant, and
nerve the arm of struggling patriots. Sometimes, however,
the possessor is conscious of his gift, but it is to
him as the celebrated anchor was to the Dutchman; he
can neither use nor exhibit it. The illustrious Thomas
Erskine, in his first attempt at the bar, made so signal a
failure as to elicit the pity of the good natured, and the
scorn and contempt of the less feeling part of the auditory.
Nothing daunted, however, for he felt undeveloped
genius strong within him, he left the court; muttering,
with more profanity than was proper, but with much

<!-- page 52 -->

truth, "By &mdash;&mdash;! it is in me, and it shall come out!"
He was right; it was in him; he did get it out, and
rose to be Lord Chancellor of England.</p>

<p>But there are men less fortunate; as gifted as Erskine,
though perhaps in a different way, they swear frequently,
as he did, but they cannot get their genius out. They
feel it, like a rat in a cage, beating against their barring
ribs, in a vain struggle to escape; and thus, with the
materials for building a reputation, and standing high
among the sons of song and eloquence, they pass their
lives in obscurity, regarded by the few who are aware
of their existence, as simpletons&mdash;fellows sent upon the
stage solely to fill up the grouping, to applaud their
superiors, to eat, sleep, and die.</p>

<p>P. PILGARLICK PIGWIGGEN, Esq., as he loves to be
styled, is one of these unfortunate undeveloped gentlemen
about town. The arrangement of his name shows
him to be no common man. Peter P. Pigwiggen would
be nothing, except a hailing title to call him to dinner,
or to insure the safe arrival of dunning letters and tailors'
bills. There is as little character about it as about the
word Towser, the individuality of which has been lost
by indiscriminate application. To all intents and purposes,
he might just as well be addressed as "You Pete
Pigwiggen," after the tender maternal fashion, in which,
in his youthful days, he was required to quit dabbling in
the gutter, to come home and be spanked. But</p>

<div class="center">

<h3>P. Pilgarlick Pigwiggen, Esq.</h3>

</div>

<!-- page 53 -->

<p>&mdash;the aristocracy of birth and genius is all about it. The
very letters seem tasselled and fringed with the cobwebs
of antiquity. The flesh creeps with awe at the sound,
and the atmosphere undergoes a sensible change, as at
the rarefying approach of a supernatural being. It penetrates
the hearer at each perspiratory pore. The dropping
of the antepenultimate in a man's name, and the
substitution of an initial therefor, has an influence which
cannot be defined&mdash;an influence peculiarly strong in the
case of P. Pilgarlick Pigwiggen&mdash;the influence of undeveloped
genius&mdash;analogous to that which bent the hazel
rod, in the hand of Dousterswivel, in the ruins of St.
Ruth, and told of undeveloped water.</p>

<p>But to avoid digression, or rather to return from a ramble
in the fields of nomenclature, P. Pilgarlick Pigwiggen
is an undeveloped genius&mdash;a wasted man; his talents
are like money in a strong box, returning no interest. He
is, in truth, a species of Byron in the egg: but unable to
chip the shell, his genius remains unhatched. The
chicken moves and faintly chirps within, but no one sees
it, no one heeds it. Peter feels the high aspirations and
the mysterious imaginings of poesy circling about the
interior of his cranium; but there they stay. When he
attempts to give them utterance, he finds that nature forgot
to bore out the passage which carries thought to the
tongue and to the finger ends; and as art has not yet
found out the method of tunnelling or of driving a drift
into the brain, to remedy such defects, and act as a general
jail delivery to the prisoners of the mind, his divine
conceptions continue pent in their osseous cell. In vain
does Pigwiggen sigh for a <i>splitting</i> headache&mdash;one that
shall ope the sutures, and set his fancies free. In vain
does he shave his forehead and turn down his shirt collar,
in hope of finding the poetic vomitory, and of leaving

<!-- page 54 -->

it clear of impediment; in vain does he drink vast quantities
of gin to raise the steam so high that it may burst
imagination's boiler, and suffer a few drops of it to
escape; in vain does he sit up late o' nights, using all
the cigars he can lay his hands on, to smoke out the
secret. 'Tis useless all. No sooner has he spread the
paper, and seized the pen to give bodily shape to airy
dreams, than a dull dead blank succeeds. As if a flourish
of the quill were the crowing of a "rooster," the dainty
Ariels of his imagination vanish. The feather drops
from his checked fingers, the paper remains unstained,
and P. Pilgarlick Pigwiggen is still an undeveloped
genius.</p>

<p>Originally a grocer's boy, Peter early felt he had a
soul above soap and candles, and he so diligently nourished
it with his master's sugar, figs, and brandy, that
early one morning he was unceremoniously dismissed
with something more substantial than a flea in his ear.
His subsequent life was passed in various callings; but
call as loudly as they would, our hero paid little attention
to their voice. He had an eagle's longings, and with an
inclination to stare the sun out of countenance, it was
not to be expected that he would stoop to be a barn-yard
fowl. Working when he could not help it; at times
pursuing check speculations at the theatre doors, by
way of turning an honest penny, and now and then
gaining entrance by crooked means, to feed his faculties
with a view of the performances, he likewise pursued
his studies through all the ballads in the market, until
qualified to read the pages of Moore and Byron.
Glowing with ambition, he sometimes pined to see
the poet's corner of our weekly periodicals graced
with his effusions. But though murder may out, his
undeveloped genius would not. Execution fell so far

<!-- page 55 -->

short of conception, that his lyrics were invariably
rejected.</p>

<p>Deep, but unsatisfactory, were the reflections which
thence arose in the breast of Pigwiggen.</p>

<p>"How is it," said he&mdash;"how is it I can't level down
my expressions to the comprehension of the vulgar, or
level up the vulgar to a comprehension of my expressions?
How is it I can't get the spigot out, so my
verses will run clear? I know what I mean myself, but
nobody else does, and the impudent editors say it's wasting
room to print what nobody understands. I've plenty
of genius&mdash;lots of it, for I often want to cut my throat,
and would have done it long ago, only it hurts. I'm
chock full of genius and running over; for I hate all sorts
of work myself, and all sorts of people mean enough to
do it. I hate going to bed, and I hate getting up. My
conduct is very eccentric and singular. I have the miserable
melancholies all the time, and I'm pretty nearly
always as cross as thunder, which is a sure sign.
Genius is as tender as a skinned cat, and flies into a
passion whenever you touch it. When I condescend to
unbuzzum myself, for a little sympathy, to folks of ornery
intellect&mdash;and caparisoned to me, I know very few
people that ar'n't ornery as to brains&mdash;and pour forth
the feelings indigginus to a poetic soul, which is always
biling, they ludicrate my sitiation, and say they don't
know what the deuse I'm driving at. Isn't genius always
served o' this fashion in the earth, as Hamlet, the boy
after my own heart, says? And when the slights of the
world, and of the printers, set me in a fine frenzy, and
my soul swells and swells, till it almost tears the shirt
off my buzzum, and even fractures my dickey&mdash;when it
expansuates and elevates me above the common herd,
they laugh again, and tell me not to be pompious. The

<!-- page 56 -->

poor plebinians and worse than Russian scurfs!&mdash;It is
the fate of genius&mdash;it is his'n, or rather I should say,
her'n&mdash;to go through life with little sympathization and
less cash. Life's a field of blackberry and raspberry
bushes. Mean people squat down and pick the fruit,
no matter how they black their fingers; while genius,
proud and perpendicular, strides fiercely on, and gets
nothing but scratches and holes tore in its trousers.
These things are the fate of genius, and when you see
'em, there is genius too, although the editors won't publish
its articles. These things are its premonitories, its
janissaries, its cohorts, and its consorts.</p>

<p>"But yet, though in flames in my interiors, I can't
get it out. If I catch a subject, while I am looking at it,
I can't find words to put it in; and when I let go, to hunt
for words, the subject is off like a shot. Sometimes I
have plenty of words, but then there is either no ideas,
or else there is such a waterworks and cataract of them,
that when I catch one, the others knock it out of my
fingers. My genius is good, but my mind is not sufficiently
manured by 'ears."</p>

<p>Pigwiggen, waiting it may be till sufficiently "manured"
to note his thoughts, was seen one fine morning
not long since, at the corner of the street, with a melancholy,
abstracted air, the general character of his
appearance. His garments were of a rusty black, much
the worse for wear. His coat was buttoned up to the
throat, probably for a reason more cogent than that of
showing the moulding of his chest, and a black handkerchief
enveloped his neck. Not a particle of white
was to be seen about him; not that we mean to infer
that his "sark" would not have answered to its name, if
the muster roll of his attire had been called, for we scorn
to speak of a citizen's domestic relations, and, until the

<!-- page 57 -->

contrary is proved, we hold it but charity to believe that
every man has as many shirts as backs. Peter's cheeks
were pale and hollow; his eyes sunken, and neither
soap nor razor had kissed his lips for a week. His
hands were in his pockets&mdash;they had the accommodation
all to themselves&mdash;nothing else was there.</p>

<p>"Is your name Peter P. Pigwiggen?" inquired a
man, with a stick, which he grasped in the middle.</p>

<p>"My name is P. Pilgarlick Pigwiggen, if you please,
my good friend," replied our hero, with a flush of indignation
at being miscalled.</p>

<p>"You'll do," was the nonchalant response; and "the
man with a stick" drew forth a parallelogram of paper,
curiously inscribed with characters, partly written and
partly printed, of which the words, "The commonwealth
greeting," were strikingly visible; "you'll do, Mr. P.
Pilgarlick Pigwiggen Peter. That's a <i>capias ad respondendum</i>,
the English of which is, you're cotched because
you can't pay; only they put it in Greek, so's not to
hurt a gentleman's feelings, and make him feel flat afore
the company. I can't say much for the manners of the
big courts, but the way the law's polite and a squire's
office is genteel, when the thing is under a hundred
dollars, is cautionary."</p>

<p>There was little to be said. Peter yielded at once.
His landlady, with little respect for the incipient Byron,
had turned him out that morning, and had likewise sent
"the man with a stick" to arrest the course of undeveloped
genius. Peter walked before, and he of the "taking
way" strolled leisurely behind.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>"It's the fate of genius, squire. The money is owed.
But how can I help it? I can't live without eating and

<!-- page 58 -->

sleeping. If I wasn't to do those functionaries, it would
be suicide, severe beyond circumflexion."</p>

<p>"Well, you know, you must either pay or go to jail."</p>

<p>"Now, squire, as a friend&mdash;I can't pay, and I don't
admire jail&mdash;as a friend, now."</p>

<p>"Got any bail?&mdash;No!&mdash;what's your trade&mdash;what name
is it?"</p>

<p>"Poesy," was the laconic, but dignified reply.</p>

<p>"Pusey?&mdash;Yes, I remember Pusey. You're in the
shoe-cleaning line, somewhere in Fourth street. Pusey,
boots and shoes cleaned here. Getting whiter, ar'n't
you? I thought Pusey was a little darker in the countenance."</p>

<p>"P-o-e-s-y!" roared Peter, spelling the word at the
top of his voice; "I'm a poet."</p>

<p>"Well, Posy, I suppose you don't write for nothing.
Why didn't you pay your landlady out of what you
received for your books, Posy?"</p>

<p>"My genius ain't developed. I haven't written any
thing yet. Only wait till my mind is manured, so I can
catch the idea, and I'll pay off all old scores."</p>

<p>" 'Twont do, Posy. I don't understand it at all.
You must go and find a little undeveloped bail, or I
must send you to prison. The officer will go with you.
But stay; there's Mr. Grubson in the corner&mdash;perhaps
he will bail you."</p>

<p>Grubson looked unpromising. He had fallen asleep,
and the flies hummed about his sulky copper-coloured
visage, laughing at his unconscious drowsy efforts to
drive them away. He was aroused by Pilgarlick, who
insinuatingly preferred the request.</p>

<p>"I'll see you hanged first," replied Mr. Grubson; "I
goes bail for nobody. I'm undeveloped myself on that

<!-- page 59 -->

subject,&mdash;not but that I have the greatest respect for you
in the world, but the most of people's cheats."</p>

<p>"You see. Posy, the development won't answer.
You must try out of doors. The officer will go with
you."</p>

<p>"Squire, as a friend, excuse me," said Pilgarlick.
"But the truth of the matter is this. I'm delicate about
being seen in the street with a constable. I'm principled
against it. The reputation which I'm going to get might
be injured by it. Wouldn't it be pretty much the same
thing, if Mr. Grubson was to go with the officer, and get
me a little bail?"</p>

<p>"I'm delicate myself," growled Grubson; "I'm principled
agin that too. Every man walk about on his own
'sponsibility; every man bail his own boat. You might
jist as well ask me to swallow your physic, or take your
thrashings."</p>

<p>Alas! Pilgarlick knew that his boat was past bailing.
Few are the friends of genius in any of its stages&mdash;very
few are they when it is undeveloped. He, therefore,
consented to sojourn in "Arch west of Broad," until the
whitewashing process could be performed, on condition
he were taken there by the "alley way;" for he still
looks ahead to the day, when a hot-pressed volume shall
be published by the leading booksellers, entitled Poems,
by P. Pilgarlick Pigwiggen, Esq.</p>

<div class="center" id="b1ch06">

<p>THE BEST-NATURED MAN IN THE
WORLD.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>A YIELDING temper, when not carefully watched and
curbed, is one of the most dangerous of faults. Like unregulated
generosity, it is apt to carry its owner into a
thousand difficulties, and, too frequently, to hurry him
into vices, if not into crimes. But as it is of advantage
to others while inflicting injury upon its possessor, it
has, by the common consent of mankind, received a fine
name, which covers its follies and promotes its growth.
This easiness of disposition, which is a compound of indolence,
vanity, and irresolution, is known and applauded
as "good-nature;" and, to have reached the superlative
degree, so as to be called the "best-natured fellow in the
world&mdash;almost too good-natured for his own good," is
regarded as a lofty merit. When applied to the proper
person, though the recipient says nothing, it may be
seen that it thrills him with delight; the colour heightens
on his cheek; and the humid brilliance of his eye
speaks him ready to weep with joy over his own fancied
perfections, and to outdo all his former outdoings. He
is warmed through by the phrase, as if he had been feasting
upon preserved ginger, and he luxuriates upon the
sensation, without counting the cost, and without calculating
the future sacrifices which it requires. He seldom
sees why he is thus praised. He is content that it is so,

<!-- page 61 -->

without inquiring into the process by which it was
brought about. It is enough for him that he is the best-natured
fellow in the world, and the conclusion generally
shows that, in phrase pugilistic, it is "enough." There
are few kinds of extravagance more ruinous than that of
indulging a desire for being excessively good-natured, as
the good-natured pussy learnt when the monkey used her
paw to draw chestnuts from the fire. A man of circumscribed
means may, with comparative safety, keep horses
and dogs, drink Champagne and Burgundy, bet upon
races and upon cock-fights; he may even gratify a taste
for being very genteel&mdash;for these things may subside into
moderation; but being very good-natured, in the popular
acception of the phrase, is like the juvenile amusement
of sliding down Market street hill on a sled. The further
one goes, the greater is the velocity; and, if the momentum
be not skilfully checked, we are likely to land in the
water.</p>

<p>The "best-natured fellow in the world" is merely
a convenience; very useful to others, but worse than
useless to himself. He is the bridge across the brook,
and men walk over him. He is the wandering pony of
the Pampas, seeking his own provender, yet ridden by
those who contribute not to his support. He giveth up
all the sunshine, and hath nothing but chilling shade for
himself. He waiteth at the table of the world, serveth
the guests, who clear the board, and, for food and pay,
give him fine words, which culinary research hath long
since ascertained cannot be used with profit, even in the
buttering of parsnips. He is, in fact, an appendage, not
an individuality; and when worn out, as he soon must
be, is thrown aside to make room for another, if another
can be had. Such is the result of excessive compliance
and obsequious good-nature. It plundereth a man of his

<!-- page 62 -->

spine, and converteth him into a flexile willow, to be
bent and twisted as his companions choose, and, should
it please them, to be wreathed into a fish-basket.</p>

<p>Are there any who doubt of this? Let them inquire
for one LENITER SALIX, and ask his opinion. Leniter
may be ragged, but his philosophy has not so many
holes in it as might be inferred from the state of his
wardrobe. Nay, it is the more perfect on that account;
a knowledge of the world penetrates the more easily
when, from defective apparel, we approach the nearer
to our original selves. Leniter's hat is crownless, and
the clear light of knowledge streams without impediment
upon his brain. He is not bound up in the strait jacket
of prejudice, for he long since pawned his solitary vest,
and his coat, made for a Goliath, hangs about him as
loosely as a politician's principles, or as the purser's shirt
in the poetical comparison. Salix has so long bumped
his head against a stone wall, that he has knocked a hole
in it, and like Cooke, the tragedian, sees through his
error. He has speculated as extensively in experience
as if it were town lots. The quantity of that article he
has purchased, could it be made tangible, would freight
a seventy-four;&mdash;were it convertible into cash, Cr&oelig;sus,
King of Lydia, son of Halyattes, would be a Chelsea
pensioner to Salix. But unluckily for him, there are
stages in life when experience itself is more ornamental
than useful. When, to use a forcible expression&mdash;when
a man is "done,"&mdash;it matters not whether he has as much
experience as Samson had hair, or as Bergami had whisker&mdash;he
can do no more. Salix has been in his time so
much pestered with <i>duns</i>, "hateful to gods and men,"
that he is <i>done</i> himself.</p>

<p>"The sun was rushing down the west," as Banim
has it, attending to its own business, and, by that means,

<!-- page 63 -->

shedding benefit upon the world, when Leniter Salix
was seen in front of a little grocery, the <i>locale</i> of which
shall be nameless, sitting dejectedly upon a keg of mackerel,
number 2. He had been "the best-natured fellow
in the world," but, as the geologists say, he was in a
state of transition, and was rapidly becoming up to <i>trap</i>.
At all events, he had his nose to the grindstone, an operation
which should make men keen. He was houseless,
homeless, penniless, and the grocery man had asked
him to keep an eye upon the dog, for fear of the mid-summer
catastrophe which awaits such animals when their
snouts are not in a bird cage. This service was to be
recompensed with a cracker, and a glass of what the
shopman was pleased to call <i>racky mirackilis</i>, a fluid
sometimes termed "railroad," from the rapidity with
which it hurries men to the end of their journey. Like
many of the best-natured fellows in the world, Salix, by
way of being a capital companion, and of not being different
from others, had acquired rather a partiality for riding
on this "railroad," and he agreed to keep his trigger eye
on the dog.</p>

<p>"That's right, Salix. I always knowed you were the
best-natured fellow in the world."</p>

<p>"H-u-m-p-s-e!" sighed Salix, in a prolonged, plaintive,
uncertain manner, as if he admitted the fact, but
doubted the honour; "h-u-m-p-s-e! but, if it wasn't for
the railroad, which is good for my complaint, because I
take it internally to drive out the perspiration, I've a sort
of a notion Carlo might take care of himself. There's
the dog playing about without his muzzle, just because
I'm good-natured; there's Timpkins at work making
money inside, instead of watching his own whelp, just
because I'm good-natured; and I'm to sit here doing
nothing instead of going to get a little job a man promised

<!-- page 64 -->

me down town, just because I'm good-natured. I can't
see exactly what's the use of it to me. It's pretty much
like having a bed of your own, and letting other people
sleep in it, soft, while you sleep on the bare floor, hard.
It wouldn't be so bad if you could have half, or quarter
of the bed; but no&mdash;these good friends of mine, as I
may say, turn in, take it all, roll themselves up in the
kivering, and won't let us have a bit of sheet to mollify
the white pine sacking bottom, the which is pleasant to
whittle with a sharp knife&mdash;quite soft enough for that
purpose&mdash;but the which is not the pink of feather beds.
I don't like it&mdash;I'm getting tired."</p>

<p>The brow of Salix began to blacken&mdash;therein having
decidedly the advantage of his boots, which could neither
blacken themselves, nor prevail on their master to do
it&mdash;when Mrs. Timpkins, the shopman's wife, popped
out with a child in her arms, and three more trapesing
after her.</p>

<p>"Law, Salix, how-dee-doo? I'm so glad&mdash;I know
you're the best-natured creature in the world. Jist hold
little Biddy a while, and keep an eye on t'other young
'uns&mdash;you're such a nurse&mdash;he! he! he!&mdash;so busy&mdash;ain't
got no girl&mdash;so busy washing&mdash;most tea time&mdash;he!
he! he! Salix."</p>

<p>Mrs. Timpkins disappeared, Biddy remained in the
arms of Salix, and "t'other young 'uns" raced about
with the dog. The trigger eye was compelled to invoke
the aid of its coadjutor.</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled Salix; "the quantity of pork
they give in this part of the town for a shilling is amazin'&mdash;I'm
so good-natured! That railroad will be well
earnt, anyhow. I'm beginning to think it's queer there
ain't more good-natured people about besides me&mdash;I'm
a sort of mayor and corporation all myself in this business.

<!-- page 65 -->

It's a monopoly where the profit's all loss. Now,
for instance, these Timpkinses won't ask me to tea, because
I'm ragged; but they ar'n't a bit too proud to ask
me to play child's nurse and dog's uncle&mdash;they won't
lend me any money, because I can't pay, and they're persimmony
and sour about cash concerns&mdash;and they won't
let me have time to earn any money, and get good
clothes&mdash;that's because I'm so good-natured. I've a good
mind to strike, and be sassy."</p>

<p>"Hallo! Salix, my good fellow!" said a man, on a
horse, as he rode up; "you're the very chap I'm looking
for. As I says to my old woman, says I, Leniter Salix
is the wholesoul'dest chap I ever did see. There's nothing
he won't do for a friend, and I'll never forget him, if I
was to live as old as Methuselah."</p>

<p>Salix smiled&mdash;Hannibal softened rocks with vinegar,
but the stranger melted the ice of our hero's resolution
with praise. Salix walked towards him, holding the child
with one hand as he extended the other for a friendly
shake.</p>

<p>"You're the best-natured fellow in the world, Salix,"
ejaculated the stranger, as he leaped from the saddle,
and hung the reins upon Salix's extended fingers, instead
of shaking hands with him; "you're the best-natured
fellow in the world. Just hold my horse a minute.
I'll be back in a jiffey, Salix; in less than half an
hour," said the dismounted rider, as he shot round the
corner.</p>

<p>"If that ain't cutting it fat, I'll be darned!" growled
Salix, as soon as he had recovered from his breathless
amazement, and had gazed from dog to babe&mdash;from horse
to children.</p>

<p>"Mr. Salix," screamed Miss Tabitha Gadabout from
the next house, "I'm just running over to Timpson's

<!-- page 66 -->

place. Keep an eye on my street door&mdash;back in a
minute."</p>

<p>She flew across the street, and as she went, the
words "best natured-soul alive" were heard upon the
breeze.</p>

<p>"That's considerable fatter&mdash;it's as fat as show beef,"
said Salix. "How many eyes has a good-natured fellow
got, anyhow? Three of mine's in use a'ready. The
good-natureder you are, the more eyes you have, I s'pose.
That job up town's jobbed without me, and where I'm
to sleep, or to eat my supper, it's not the easiest thing
in the world to tell. Ain't paid my board this six months,
I'm so good-natured; and the old woman's so good-natured,
she said I needn't come back. These Timpkinses
and all of 'em are ready enough at asking me
to do things, but when I ask them&mdash;&mdash;There, that dog's
off, and the ketchers are coming&mdash;Carlo! Carlo!"</p>

<p>The baby began squalling, and the horse grew restive,
the dog scampered into the very teeth of danger; and the
three little Timpkinses, who could locomote, went
scrabbling, in different directions, into all sorts of mischief,
until finally one of them pitched head foremost into a
cellar.</p>

<p>Salix grew furious. "Whoa, pony!&mdash;hush, you infernal
brat!&mdash;here. Carlo!&mdash;Thunder and crockery!&mdash;there's
a young Timpkins smashed and spoilt!&mdash;knocked into a
cocked hat!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Salix!" shouted a boy, from the other side of
the way, "when you're done that 'ere, mammy says
if you won't go a little narrand for her, you're so good-nater'd."</p>

<p>There are moments when calamity nerves us; when
wild frenzy congeals into calm resolve; as one may see
by penning a cat in a corner. It is then that the coward

<!-- page 67 -->

fights; that the oppressed strikes at the life of the oppressor.
That moment had come to Salix. He stood bolt
upright, as cold and as straight as an icicle. His good-nature
might be seen to drop from him in two pieces,
like Cinderella's kitchen garments in the opera. He
laid Biddy Timpkins on the top of the barrel, released
the horse, giving him a vigorous kick, which sent him
flying down the street, and strode indignantly away,
leaving Carlo, Miss Gadabout's house, and all other
matters in his charge, to the guardianship of chance.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>The last time Salix was seen in the busy haunts of
men, he looked the very incarnation of gloom and despair.
His very coat had gone to relieve his necessities,
and he wandered slowly and dejectedly about, relieving
the workings of his perturbed spirit by kicking whatever
fell in his way.</p>

<p>"I'm done," soliloquized he; "pardenership between
me and good-nature is this day dissolved, and all persons
indebted will please to settle with the undersigned, who
alone is authorized. Yes, there's a good many indebted,
and its high time to dissolve, when your pardener has sold
all the goods and spent all the money. Once I had a
little shop&mdash;ah! wasn't it nice?&mdash;plenty of goods and
plenty of business. But then comes one troop of fellows,
and they wanted tick&mdash;I'm so good-natured; then comes
another set of chaps, who didn't let bashfulness stand in
their way a minute; they sailed a good deal nearer the
wind, and wanted to borry money&mdash;I'm so good-natured;
and more asked me to go security. These fellows were
always very particular friends of mine, and got what
they asked for; but I was a very particular friend of
theirs, and couldn't get it back. It was one of the
good rules that won't work both ways; and I, somehow

<!-- page 68 -->

or other, was at the wrong end of it, for it wouldn't
work my way at all. There's few rules that will, barring
substraction, and division, and alligation, when our
folks allegated against me that I wouldn't come to no
good. All the cypherin' I could ever do made more
come to little, and little come to less; and yet, as I said
afore, I had a good many assistants too.</p>

<p>"Business kept pretty fair; but I wasn't cured.
Because I was good-natured, I had to go with 'em frolicking,
tea partying, excursioning, and busting; and for
the same reason, I was always appinted treasurer to
make the distribution when there wasn't a cent of surplus
revenue in the treasury, but my own. It was my
job to pay all the bills. Yes, it was always 'Salix, you
know me'&mdash;' Salix, pony up at the bar, and lend us a
levy'&mdash;' Salix always shells out like a gentleman.'&mdash;Oh!
to be sure, and why not?&mdash;now I'm shelled out myself&mdash;first
out of my shop by old <i>venditioni exponas</i>, at the
State House&mdash;old <i>fiery fash 'us</i> to me directed. But
they didn't direct him soon enough, for he only got the
fixtures. The goods had gone out on a bust long before
I busted. Next, I was shelled out of my boarding
house; and now," (with a lugubrious glance at his shirt
and pantaloons,) "I'm nearly shelled out of my clothes.
It's a good thing they can't easy shell me out of my
skin, or they would, and let me catch my death of cold.
I'm a mere shell-fish&mdash;an oyster with the kivers off.</p>

<p>"But, it was always so&mdash;when I was a little boy,
they coaxed all my pennies out of me; coaxed me to
take all the jawings, and all the hidings, and to go first
into all sorts of scrapes, and precious scrapings they
used to be. I wonder if there isn't two kinds of people&mdash;one
kind that's made to chaw up t'other kind, and t'other
kind that's made to be chawed up by one kind?&mdash;cat-kind

<!-- page 69 -->

of people and mouse-kind of people? I guess there
is&mdash;I'm very much mouse myself.</p>

<p>"What I want to know is what's to become of me.
I've spent all I had in getting my eddication. Learnin',
they say, is better than houses and lands. I wonder if
anybody would swap some house and land with me for
mine? I'd go it even, and ask no boot. They should
have it at prime cost; but they won't; and I begin to be
afraid I'll have to get married, or list in the marines.
That's what most people do when they've nothing to
do."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>What became of Leniter Salix immediately, is immaterial;
what will become of him eventually, is clear
enough. His story is one acting every day, and, though
grotesquely sketched, is an evidence of the danger of an
accommodating disposition when not regulated by prudence.
The softness of "the best-natured fellow in the
world" requires a large admixture of hardening alloy to
give it the proper temper.</p>

<p>WHENEVER we look upon the crowded thoroughfare,
or regard the large assembly, we are compelled to admit
that the infinite variety of form in the human race contributes
largely to the picturesque. The eye travels over
the diversity of shape and size without fatigue, and renews
its strength by turning from one figure to another,
when, at each remove, it is sure to find a difference.
Satiated with gazing at rotundity, it is refreshed by a
glance at lathiness; and, tired with stooping to the lowly,
it can mount like a bird to the aspiring head which tops
a maypole. But, while the potency of these pictorial
beauties is admitted, it must be conceded that the variations
from the true standard, although good for the eye-sight,
are productive of much inconvenience; and that, to
consider the subject like a Benthamite, utility and the
general advantage would be promoted if the total amount
of flesh, blood, bone, and muscle were more equally distributed.
As affairs are at present arranged, it is almost
impossible to find a "ready made coat" that will answer
one's purpose, and a man may stroll through half the
shops in town without being able to purchase a pair of
boots which he can wear with any degree of comfort. In

<!-- page 71 -->

hanging a lamp, every shop keeper, who "lights up,"
knows that it is a very troublesome matter so to swing
it, that, while the short can see the commodities, the tall
will not demolish the glass. If an abbreviated "turnippy"
man, in the goodness of his heart and <i>in articulo mortis</i>,
bequeaths his wardrobe to a long and gaunt friend, of
what service is the posthumous present? It is available
merely as new clothing for the juveniles, or as something
toward another kitchen carpet. Many a martial spirit is
obliged to content himself with civic employment, although
a mere bottle of fire and wrath, because heroism
is enlisted by inches, and not by degree. If under "five
foot six," C&aelig;sar himself could find no favour in the eye
of the recruiting sergeant, and Alexander the Great
would be allowed to bestride no Bucephalus in a dragoon
regiment of modern times. Thus, both they who get too
much, and they who get too little, in Dame Nature's apportionment
bill, as well as those who, though abundantly
endowed, are not well made up, have divers reasons for
grumbling, and for wishing that a more perfect uniformity
prevailed.</p>

<p>Some of the troubles which arise from giving a man
more than his share in altitude, find illustration in the
subjoined narrative:&mdash;</p>

<p>Linkum Langcale is a subject <i>in extenso</i>. He is, to
use the words of the poet, suggested by his name,</p>

<p class="small">&mdash;&mdash;"<i>A bout</i>"<br/>
"<i>Of linked sweetness long drawn out.</i>"</p>

<p>and, in speaking of him, it is not easy to be brief. Linkum
is entirely too long for his own comfort&mdash;something
short&mdash;if the word <i>short</i> may be used in this connexion&mdash;something
short of the height of the Titans of old, who
pelted Saturn with brickbats; but how much has never

<!-- page 72 -->

yet been ascertained, none of his acquaintances being
sufficiently acquainted with trigonometry to determine
the fact. He is one of those men who, like the gentle
Marcia, "tower above their sex," and must always be
called down to their dinner, as no information can be
imparted to them unless it be hallooed up; and in conversing
with whom, it is always necessary to begin by
hailing the maintop. There is not, however, more
material in Linkum than enough for a man of ordinary
length. The fault is in his not being properly made up.
He is abominably wire drawn&mdash;stretched out, as Shakspeare
says, almost to the crack of doom. It is clear
that there has been an attempt to make too much of
him, but the frame of the idea has not been well filled
out. He is the streak of a Colossus, and he resembles
the willow wand at which Locksley shot his gray goose
shaft in the lists of Ashby de la Zouche. The consequence
is, that Linkum is a crank vessel. If he wore a
feather in his cap, he would be capsized at every corner;
and as it is, he finds it very difficult to get along on a
windy day, without a paving stone in each coat pocket
to preserve the balance of power. He is, however, of a
convivial nature, and will not refuse his glass, notwithstanding
the aptitude of alcohol to ascend into the brain,
and so to encumber it as to render a perpendicular
position troublesome to men shorter than himself. When
in this condition, his troubles are numberless, and among
other matters, he finds it very difficult to get a clear fall,
there being in compact cities very little room to spare
for the accommodation of long men tumbling down in
the world.</p>

<p>One evening Linkum walked forth to a convivial
meeting, and supped with a set of jolly companions.
Late at night a rain came on, which froze as it fell, and

<!-- page 73 -->

soon made the city one universal slide, sufficiently
"glip" for all purposes, without the aid of saw-dust.
Of Linkum's sayings and doings at the social board, no
record is preserved; but it is inferred that his amusements
were not of a nature to qualify him for the safe
performance of a journey so slippery as that which it
was necessary to undertake to reach home. No lamps
were lighted, they who were abroad being under the
necessity of supposing the moonshine, and of seeing
their way as they walked, or of gathering themselves up
when they fell, by the lantern of imagination.</p>

<p>"Good night, fellers," said Linkum, at the top of the
steps, as the door closed after him. He pulled his hat
over his eyes determinedly, buttoned his coat with
resolution, and sucked at his cigar with that iron energy
peculiar to men about to set forth on their way home on a
cold, stormy night. The fire of the cigar reflected from
his nose was the only illumination to be seen; and
Linkum, putting his hands deep into his pockets, kept
his position on the first step of the six which were
between him and the pavement.</p>

<p>"I've no doubt," said he, as he puffed forth volumes
of smoke, and seemed to cogitate deeply&mdash;"I've not the
slightest doubt that this is as beautiful a night as ever
was; only it's so dark you can't see the pattern of it.
One night is pretty much like another night in the dark;
but it's a great advantage to a good looking evening, if
the lamps are lit, so you can twig the stars and the
moonshine. The fact is, that in this 'ere city, we do
grow the blackest moons, and the hardest moons to find,
I ever did see. Sometimes I'm most disposed to send
the bellman after 'em&mdash;or get a full blooded pinter to
pint 'em out, while I hold a candle to see which way he
pints. It wouldn't be a bad notion on sich occasions to

<!-- page 74 -->

ask the man in the steeple to ring which way the moon
is. Lamps is lamps, and moons is moons, in a business
pint of view, but practically they ain't much if the
wicks ain't afire. When the luminaries are, as I may
say, in the raw, it's bad for me. I can't see the ground
as perforately as little fellers, and every dark night I'm
sure to get a hyst&mdash;either a forrerd hyst, or a backerd
hyst, or some sort of a hyst&mdash;but more backerds than
forrerds, 'specially in winter. One of the most unfeeling
tricks I know of, is the way some folks have
got of laughing out, yaw-haw! when they see a gentleman
ketching a riggler hyst&mdash;a long gentleman,
for instance, with his legs in the air, and his noddle
splat down upon the cold bricks. A hyst of itself is
bad enough, without being sniggered at: first, your
sconce gets a crack; then, you see all sorts of stars,
and have free admission to the fireworks; then, you
scramble up, feeling as if you had no head on your
shoulders, and as if it wasn't you, but some confounded
disagreeable feller in your clothes; yet the jacksnipes
all grin, as if the misfortunes of human nature was only
a poppet show. I wouldn't mind it, if you could get up
and look as if you didn't care. But a man can't rise,
after a royal hyst, without letting on he feels flat. In
such cases, however, sympathy is all gammon; and as
for sensibility of a winter's day, people keep it all for
their own noses, and can't be coaxed to retail it by the
small."</p>

<p>Linkum paused in his prophetic dissertation upon
"hysts"&mdash;the popular pronunciation, in these parts, of
the word <i>hoist</i>, which is used&mdash;<i>quasi lucus a non
lucendo</i>&mdash;to convey the idea of the most complete tumble
which man can experience. A fall, for instance, is
indeterminate. It may be an easy slip down&mdash;a gentle

<!-- page 75 -->

visitation of mother earth; but a hyst is a rapid, forcible
performance, which may be done, as Linkum observes,
either backward or forward, but of necessity with such
violence as to knock the breath out of the body, or it is
unworthy of the noble appellation of hyst. It is an apt,
but figurative mode of expression, and it is often carried
still further; for people sometimes say, "lower him up,
and hyst him down."</p>

<p>Our hero held on firmly to the railing, and peered
keenly into the darkness, without discovering any object
on which his vision could rest. The gloom was substantial.
It required sharper eyes than his to bore a
hole in it. The wind was up, and the storm continued
to coat the steps and pavements with a sheet of ice.</p>

<p>"It's raining friz potatoes," observed Linkum; "I
feel 'em, though I can't see 'em, bumping the end of my
nose; so I must hurry home as fast as I can."</p>

<p>Heedless and hapless youth! He made a vain attempt
to descend, but, slipping, he came in a sitting posture
upon the top step, and, in that attitude, flew down like
lightning bump! bump! bump! The impetus he had
acquired prevented him from stopping on the sidewalk,
notwithstanding his convulsive efforts to clutch the icy
bricks, and he <i>skuted</i> into the gutter, whizzing over the
curbstone, and splashing into the water, like a young
Niagara.</p>

<p>A deep silence ensued, broken solely by the pattering
of the rain and the howling of the wind. Linkum was
an exhausted receiver; the hyst was perfect, the breath
being completely knocked out of him.</p>

<p>"Laws-a-massy!" at length he panted, "ketching"
breath at intervals, and twisting about as if in pain; "my
eyes! sich a hyst! Sich a quantity of hysts all in one!
The life's almost bumped out of me, and I'm jammed

<!-- page 76 -->

up so tight, I don't believe I'm so tall by six inches as I
was before. I'm druv' up and clinched, and I'll have to
get tucks in my trousers."</p>

<p>Linkum sat still, ruminating on the curtailment of
his fair proportions, and made no effort to rise. The
door soon opened again, and Mr. Broad Brevis came
forth, at which a low, suppressed chuckle was uttered
by Linkum, as he looked over his shoulder, anticipating
"a quantity of hysts all in one" for the new comer,
whose figure, however,&mdash;short and stout,&mdash;was much
better calculated for the operation than Linkum's. But
Brevis seemed to suspect that the sliding was good, and
the skating magnificent.</p>

<p>"No, you don't!" quoth he, as he tried the step with
one foot, and recovered himself; "I haven't seen the
Alleghany Portage and inclined planes for nothing. It
takes me to diminish the friction, and save the wear and
tear."</p>

<p>So saying, he quietly tucked up his coat-tails, and
sitting down upon the mat, which he grasped with both
hands, gave himself a gentle impulse, crying "All aboard!"
and slid slowly but majestically down. As he came to
the plain sailing across the pavement, he twanged forth
"Ta-ra-ta-ra-ta-ra-tra-a-a!" in excellent imitation of the
post horn, and brought up against Linkum. "Clear the
course for the express mail, or I'll report you to the
department!" roared Brevis, trumpeting the "alarum,"
so well known to all who have seen a tragedy&mdash;"Tra-tretra-ta-ra-tra-a-a!"</p>

<p>"That's queer fun, anyhow," said a careful wayfarer,
turning the corner, with lantern in hand, and sock on
foot, who, after a short parley, was induced to set the
gentlemen on their pins. First planting Brevis against
the pump, who sang "Let me lean on thee," from the

<!-- page 77 -->

Sonnambula, in prime style, he undertook to lift up
Linkum.</p>

<p>"Well," observed the stranger, "this is a chap without
no end to him&mdash;he'd be pretty long a drowning, any
how. If there was many more like him in the gutters,
it would be better to get a windlass, and wind 'em up.
I never see'd a man with so much slack. The corporation
ought to buy him, starch him up stiff, cut a hole for
a clock in his hat, and use him for a steeple; only
Downing wouldn't like to trust himself on the top of
such a ricketty concern.&mdash;Neighbour, shall I fetch the
Humane Society's apparatus?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I ain't drownded, only bumped severe. The
curbstones have touched my feelings. I'm all over like
a map&mdash;red, blue, and green."</p>

<p>"Now," said their friendly assistant, grinning at the
joke, and at the recompense he had received for the job,
"now, you two hook on to one another like Siameses,
and mosey. You've only got to tumble one a top of
t'other, and it won't hurt. Tortle off&mdash;it's slick going&mdash;'specially
if you're going down. Push ahead!" continued
he, as he hitched them together; and away they
went, a pair of slippers, arm in arm. Many were their
tumbles and many their mischances before they reached
their selected resting place.</p>

<p>"I can't stand this," said Linkum to his companion,
as they were slipping and falling; "but it's mostly owing
to my being so tall. I wish I was razee'd, and then it
wouldn't happen. The awning posts almost knock the
head off me; I'm always tumbling over wheelbarrows,
dogs, and children, because, if I look down, I'm certain
to knock my noddle against something above. It's a complete
nuisance to be so tall. Beds are too short; if you
go to a tea-fight, the people are always tumbling over

<!-- page 78 -->

your trotters, and breaking their noses, which is what
young ladies ain't partial to; and if you tipple too much
toddy of a slippery night&mdash;about as easy a thing to do as
you'd wish to try&mdash;you're sure to get a hyst a square long&mdash;just
such a one as I've had. If I'd thought of it, I
could have said the multiplication table while I was going
the figure. Stumpy chaps, such as you, ain't got no
troubles in this world."</p>

<p>"That's all you know about it," puffed Brevis, as
Linkum alternately jerked him from his feet, and then
caused him to slide in the opposite direction, with his
heels ploughing the ice, like a shaft horse holding back:
"phew! That's all you know about it&mdash;stumpies have
troubles."</p>

<p>"I can't borrow coats," added Linkum, soliloquizing,
"because I don't like cuffs at the elbows. I can't
borrow pants, because it isn't the fashion to wear knee-breeches,
and all my stockings are socks. I can't hide
when anybody owes me a lambasting. You can see me
a mile. When I sit by the fire, I can't get near enough
to warm my body, without burning my knees; and in a
stage-coach, there's no room between the benches, and
the way you get the cramp&mdash;don't mention it."</p>

<p>"I don't know nothing about all these things; but to
imagine I was a tall chap&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't try; you'll hurt yourself, for it's a great stretch
of imagination for a little feller to do that."</p>

<p>After which amicable colloquy, nothing more was
heard of them, except that, before retiring to rest, they
chuckled over the idea that the coming spring would
sweat the ice to death for the annoyance it had caused
them. But ever while they live, will they remember
"the night of hysts."</p>

afflictions are temporary in their nature; the most inveterate
of chronic diseases leaves the patient his hours of
comfort; but he who lacks decision of character must
cease to act altogether before he can be released from the
suffering it occasions. It is felt, whether the occasion
be great or small, whenever there is more than one method
of arriving at the same end, and it veers like a <i>girouette</i>
at the aspect of alternatives. One can scarcely go so far
as the poet, who quaintly says:</p>

<p>"<i>It needs but this, be bold, bold, bold;<br/>
'Tis every virtue told&mdash;<br/>
Honour and truth, humanity and skill,<br/>
The noblest charity the mind can will.</i>"</p>

<p>But the lines are pregnant with meaning. The curse of
indecision impedes the growth of virtue, and renders our
best powers comparatively inoperative.</p>

<!-- page 80 -->

<p>It would certainly be the parent of interminable confusion
if all men were qualified to lead in the affairs of
the world. The impulse to direct and to command is
almost irrepressible. He who is born with it instinctively
places himself at the head of a movement, and
clutches the baton of authority as if it had been his plaything
from infancy. Even in the sports of childhood,
the controlling and master spirit of the merry group is to
be detected at a glance; and, if three men act together
for a day, the leading mind discovers and assumes its
place. The inferior in mental power sink rapidly to their
appropriate station; the contemplation of an emergency
tends to convince them that they are incompetent to head
the column, and, although they may grumble a little,
they soon fall quietly into the ranks. It, therefore,
would not answer if all men had that self-reliance and
that iron will which are the essential ingredients in the
composition of a leading mind. The community would
be broken up into a mob of generals, with never a soldier
to be had for love or money. There would be no more
harmony extant than there is in the vocal efforts of a
roomfull of bacchanalians, when each man singeth his
own peculiar song, and hath no care but that he may
be louder than his boon companions. Our time would
be chiefly spent in trying to disprove the axiom, that
when two men ride a horse one must ride behind. Each
pony in the field would have riders enough; but, instead
of jogging steadily toward any definite end, he who was
in the rear would endeavour to clamber to the front, and
thus a species of universal leap-frog would be the order
of the day. Great results could not be achieved, for action
in masses would be a thing unheard of, and the nations
would be a collection of unbound sticks.</p>

<p>Yet the cultivation of the energies to a certain extent

<!-- page 81 -->

is a matter of import to the welfare and happiness of
every individual. We are frequently placed in circumstances
in which it is necessary to be our own captain-general;
and, with all deference to the improving spirit
of the time, and to the labours of the many who devote
themselves to the advancement of education, it must be
confessed that the energies do not always receive the attention
to which they are entitled. It is true there is an
abundance of teaching; we can scarcely move without
coming in contact with a professor of something, who,
in the plenitude of his love for his fellows, promises, for
the most trifling consideration, to impart as much if not
more than he knows himself, in a time so incredibly
short that, if we were not aware of the wonder-working
power of the high pressure principle, we should not believe
it; but no one has yet appeared in the useful character
of a "Professor of Decision"&mdash;no one has yet thought it
a good speculation to teach in six lessons of an hour
each, the art of being able without assistance speedily to
make up the mind upon a given subject, and to keep it
made up, like a well-packed knapsack. There are arithmeticians
and algebraists in plenty; but the continent
may be ranged without finding him who can instruct us
how to solve, as Jack Downing would express it, a "tuff
sum" in conduct, and to act unflinchingly upon the
answer; and ingenuity has discovered no instrument to
screw the mind to the sticking place. Now, although
humility may be a very amiable characteristic, and deference
to the opinions of others a very pleasing trait, yet
promptness in decision and boldness in action form the
best leggins with which to scramble through the thistles
and prickles of active life; and a professor of the kind
alluded to would doubtless have many pupils from the
ranks of those who have, by virtue of sundry tears

<!-- page 82 -->

and scratches, become anxious for a pair of nether integuments
of that description. At least, he might rely
upon</p>

<div class="center">

<p>DUBERLY DOUBTINGTON,</p>

<p class="small">THE MAN WHO COULDN'T MAKE UP HIS MIND</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>"LEAH, tell your master dinner's been waiting for him
this hour."</p>

<p>"He can't come, mem;&mdash;the man's with him yet,
mem."</p>

<p>"What man?"</p>

<p>"The solumcolly man, mem;&mdash;the man that stays so
long, and is always so hard to go."</p>

<p>Every one who has visiters is aware of the great
difference among them in the matter referred to by Leah.
In fact, they may be divided into two classes&mdash;visiters
who are "easy to go" and administer themselves, according
to Hahnemann, in hom&oelig;opathic doses, and visiters
who are "hard to go," and are exhibited in quantity, in
conformity with regular practice.</p>

<p>The individual who was guilty of keeping Mr. Edax
Rerum from his dinner was Duberly Doubtington, a
man who couldn't make up his mind&mdash;a defect of character
which rendered him peculiarly hard to go, and
made him responsible for having caused many to eat
their mutton cold. It was Juliet who found,</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"<i>Parting such sweet sorrow,<br/>
That she could say good night till it be morrow;</i>"</p>

</div>

<p>and Duberly's farewells are equally interminable. When
he has once fairly effected a lodgment, he is rooted to

<!-- page 83 -->

the spot. It is as difficult for him to go off, as it frequently
is for stage heroes to make their pistols shoot. But,
though it is hard for him to go, yet he finds it quite easy
to be hours in going. By way of preparation, he first
reaches his hat, and "smooths its raven down." He
then lays it aside again for the greater convenience of
drawing on a glove, and that operation being completed,
the gauntlet is speedily drawn off that he may adjust his
side-locks. Much time being consumed in these interesting
preliminaries, he has no difficulty at all in employing
an additional hour when once fairly upon his
legs. He discourses over the back of his chair, he
pauses at the parlour door, he hesitates in the hall, and
rallies manfully on the outer steps. The colder the
weather the more determined his grasp upon his victim,
having decidedly the advantage over the resident of the
mansion, in being hatted, coated, and gloved. In this
way, indeed, he deserves a medal from the faculty for
cutting out doctor's work, especially in influenza times.</p>

<p>The straps and buckles of Duberly's resolution will
not hold, no matter how tightly he may pull them up,
and he has suffered much in the unphilosophic attempt
to sit upon two stools. When he starts upon a race, an
unconsidered shade of opinion is sure to catch him by
the skirt, and draw him back. He is, in a measure,
Fabian in policy. He shifts his position continually,
and never hazards an attack. His warfare is a succession
of feints and unfinished demonstrations, and he has
been aptly likened to a leaden razor, which looks sharp
enough, but will turn in the cutting. He is in want of
a pair of mental spectacles; for he has a weakness in the
optic nerve of his mind's eye which prevents him, in
regarding the future, from seeing beyond the nose of the
present movement. The chemistry of events, which

<!-- page 84 -->

figures out ulterior results from immediate combination
and instant action, is a science as yet unknown to Duberly
Doubtington. He cannot tell what to think; he
knows not what to do. The situations in which he is
placed have never occurred to him before; the lights of
experience are wanting, and he is therefore perplexed
in the labyrinth. Like the fabled coffin of Mohammed,
he is always in a state of "betweenity." He is, in short,
as a forcible writer well observes, one of those unfortunate
people who seldom experience "<i>the sweet slumber
of a decided opinion.</i>"</p>

<p>Such is the moral man of Duberly Doubtington, and
his physical man betrays traits of indecision equally as
strong. He tries to encourage his heart by cocking his
beaver <i>&agrave; la militaire</i>, but its furry fierceness cannot
contradict the expression of the features it surmounts.
His eyebrows form an uncertain arch, rising nearly an
inch above the right line of determination, and the button
of his nose is so large and blunt as to lend any thing but
a penetrating look to his countenance. His under lip
droops as if afraid to clench resolutely with its antagonist;
and his whiskers hang dejectedly down, instead of
bristling like a <i>chevaux de frise</i> toward the outer angle
of the eye. The hands of Mr. Doubtington always
repose in his pockets, unwilling to trust to their own
means of support, and he invariably leans his back
against the nearest sustaining object. When he walks,
his feet shuffle here and there so dubiously that one may
swear they have no specific orders where to go; and so
indefinite are the motions of his body, that even the tails
of his coat have no characteristic swing. They look,
not like Mr. Doubtington's coat-tails, but like coat-tails
in the abstract&mdash;undecided coat-tails, that have not yet
got the hang of anybody's back, and have acquired no

<!-- page 85 -->

more individuality than those which dangle at the shop
doors in Water street.</p>

<p>Duberly Doubtington was at one time tolerably comfortable
in his pecuniary circumstances. His father had
been successful in trade, and, of course, thought it unnecessary
to teach his children to make up their minds
about anything but enjoying themselves. This neglect,
however, proved fatal to the elder Doubtington.</p>

<p>That worthy individual being taken one warm summer
afternoon with an apoplectic fit, the younger Doubtington
was so perplexed whether or not to send for a physician,
and if he did, what physician should be called in&mdash;whether
he should or should not try to bleed him with
a penknife, and whether it was most advisable to have
him put to bed up stairs or to leave him upon the sofa
down stairs,&mdash;that the old gentleman, being rather pressed
for time, could not await the end of the debate, and
quietly slipped out of the world before his son could
make up his mind as to the best method of keeping him
in it. In fact, it was almost a chance that the senior
Doubtington obtained sepulture at all, as Duberly could
not make up his mind where that necessary business
should take place; and he would have been balancing the
pros and cons of the question to this day, if some other
person, more prompt of decision, had not settled the
matter.</p>

<p>Duberly Doubtington was now his own master.
There were none entitled to direct, to control, or to
advise him. He was the Ph&aelig;ton of his own fortunes, and
could drive the chariot where he pleased. But, although
he had often looked forward to this important period
with much satisfaction, and had theorised upon it with
great delight, yet in practice he found it not quite so well
adapted to his peculiar abilities as he thought it would

<!-- page 86 -->

be. A share of decision is required even by those who
are placed beyond the necessity of toiling for bread. The
disposition of his means frequently called on him to
resolve upon a definite course.</p>

<p>"I regard it as a very fair investment, Mr. Doubtington,"
said his broker; "your money is useless
where it is."</p>

<p>"But, what do you advise?&mdash;under the circumstances,
what should I do?" replied Duberly.</p>

<p>"Of course, I don't pretend to direct. I want no unnecessary
responsibility. There's no knowing what
may happen these slippery times. I think the chance a
good one; but make up your mind about it."</p>

<p>There are people who talk about making up one's
mind as if it were a task as easy as to eat a dinner, or
as if it were as purely mechanical as driving a nail, or
putting on a pair of old familiar boots.</p>

<p>"I pay that man for attending to my business,"
muttered Duberly, "and yet he has the impudence to
tell me to make up my mind!&mdash;That's the very thing I
want him to do for me. The tailor makes my clothes&mdash;Sally
makes my bed&mdash;nature makes my whiskers, and
John makes my fires; yet I must be bothered to make
up my mind about money matters! I can't&mdash;the greatest
nuisances alive are these responsibility shifting people;
and, if some one would tell me who else to get to attend
to my business, I'd send that fellow flying."</p>

<p>Difficult, however, as he supposed it would be, Duberly
at length found a gentleman manager of his pecuniary
affairs, who never troubled him to make up his mind,
with what results shall appear anon.</p>

<p>Duberly could not resolve whether it was the best
policy to travel first in the old world or in the new, and
he therefore did neither; but as time is always heavy on

<!-- page 87 -->

the hands of those who have much of it at disposal, and
as it is difficult to lounge eternally at home, or in the
street, he slowly established what the Scotch call a
"howf" for each portion of the day. In the morning
he dozed over the newspapers at a reading room; between
noon and the dinner hour, he lolled upon three
chairs at the office of his friend Capias the lawyer, by
way of facilitating that individual's business; the afternoon
was divided between whittling switches at home
and riding to some popular resort, where he cut his name
upon the table. In the evening, if he did not yawn at
the theatre, he visited some hospitable mansion, where
the elders were good natured and the juniors agreeable.</p>

<p>At the house of Mrs. St. Simon Sapsago, a bouncing
widow, with a dashing son, and a pair of daughters,
Mr. Duberly Doubtington was invariably well received;
for, although he could not make up his mind, he was in
other respects so "eligible" that Mrs. St. Simon Sapsago
was always pleased to see him, and willing that he
should either listen or talk as much as he liked within
her doors. Miss Ethelinda St. Simon Sapsago was a
very pretty girl; and, for some reason or other, comported
herself so graciously to Duberly, that, when troubled to
form a conclusion, he usually asked her advice, and to his
great satisfaction, was sure to receive it in a comfortable,
decisive way.</p>

<p>"Miss Ethelinda, I'm trying to make up my mind
about coats; but I can't tell whether I like bright buttons
or not. Nor do I know exactly which are the
nicest colours. I do wish there was only one sort of
buttons, and only one kind of colour; the way every
thing is now, is so tiresome&mdash;one's perpetually bothered."</p>

<p>So Ethelinda St. Simon Sapsago, with her sweetest

<!-- page 88 -->

smile, would give her views upon the subject, to Duberly's
great delight. In fact, she was his "council's consistory;"
or, as the Indians have it, she was his "sense-bearer,"
a very important item in the sum total of one's
domestic relations.</p>

<p>But, though these consultations were very frequent,
still Duberly said nothing to the purpose, notwithstanding
the fact that every one looked upon it as a "settled
thing," and wanted to know when it was to be. Duberly
Doubtington, however, never dreamed of matrimony; or
if he did, it only floated like a vague mist across the
distant horizon of his speculative thoughts. He regarded
it as a matter of course that, at some period or other, he
should have a wife and children&mdash;just as we all expect
either to be bald, or to have gray hairs, and to die: but
he shivered at the idea of being called on to make up his
mind on such a step. He had a faint hope that he
would be married, as it were, imperceptibly; that it
would, like old age, steal upon him by degrees, so that he
might be used to it before he found it out. The connubial
state, however, is not a one into which a Doubtington
can slide by degrees; there is no such thing as being imperceptibly
married, a fact of which Mrs. and Miss St.
Simon Sapsago were fully aware, and, therefore, resolved
to precipitate matters by awakening Duberly's jealousy.</p>

<p>Ethelinda became cold upon giving her advice on the
subject of new coats and other matters. Indeed, when
asked by Duberly whether she did not think it would be
better for him to curtail his whiskers somewhat during
the summer months, she went so far as to say that she
didn't care what he did with them, and that she never
had observed whether he wore huge corsair whiskers, or
lawyerlike apologies. Duberly was shocked at a
defection so flagrant on the part of his "sense-bearer."

<!-- page 89 -->

Insult his whiskers!&mdash;he couldn't make up his mind
what to think of it.</p>

<p>But still more shocked was he when he observed that
she smiled upon Mr. Adolphus Fitzflam, who cultivated
immense black curls, latitudinarian whiskers, black
moustaches, with an <i>imperial</i> to match&mdash;Fitzflam, who
made it the business of his life to "do the appalling," and
out-haired everybody except the bison at the "Zoological
Institute." Duberly felt uncomfortable; he was not
in love&mdash;at least he had never found it out&mdash;but he was
troubled with a general uneasiness, an oppression, a depression,
and a want of appetite. "Gastric derangement,"
said the quack advertisements, and Duberly took a box
of pills: "but one disease," said the newspapers, and
Duberly swallowed another box of pills, but without
relief. Whenever Fitzflam approached, the symptoms
returned.</p>

<p>"I can't make up my mind about it," said Duberly;
"but I don't think I like that buffalo fellow, Fitzflam.
Why don't they make him up into mattrasses, and stuff
cushions with whatever's left?"</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>"Mr. Doubtington, isn't Augustus Fitzflam a duck?"
said Ethelinda one evening when they were left <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te;</i>
"such beautiful hair!"</p>

<p>"I can't tell whether he's a duck or not," said Duberly,
dryly, "I haven't seen much more of him than the
tip of his nose; but, if not a member of the goose
family, he will some day share the fate of the man I saw
at Fairmount&mdash;be drowned in his own <i>locks</i>."</p>

<p>"But he looks so romantic&mdash;so piratical&mdash;as if he had
something on his mind, never slept, and had a silent
sorrow here."</p>

<!-- page 90 -->

<p>"He had better try a box of the vegetable pills,"
thought Duberly.</p>

<p>"Well, I do declare it's not surprising that so many
have fallen in love with Adolphus Fitzflam," and Miss
Ethelinda St. Simon Sapsago breathed a scarcely perceptible
sigh.</p>

<p>Duberly started&mdash;his eyes were opened to his own
complaint at once, and somehow or other, without
making up his mind, he hurriedly declared himself.</p>

<p>"Speak to my ma," faintly whispered Miss Ethelinda
St. Simon Sapsago.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," replied Duberly Doubtington, taking
a tender, but rapid farewell.</p>

<p>Duberly was horror-struck at his own rashness. He
tossed and rolled all night, trying to make up his mind
as to the propriety of his conduct. He stayed at home
all day for the same purpose, and the next day found
him still irresolute.</p>

<p>"Mrs. St. Simon Sapsago's compliments, and wishes
to know if Mr. Duberly Doubtington is ill."</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>Three days more, and yet the mind of Mr. Doubtington
was a prey to perplexity.</p>

<p>Mr. Julius St. Simon Sapsago called to ask the
meaning of his conduct, and Duberly promised to inform
him when he had made up his mind.</p>

<p>Mr. Adolphus Fitzflam, as the friend of Julius St. S.
Sapsago, with a challenge.</p>

<p>"Leave your errand, boy," said Doubtington, angrily,
"and go."</p>

<p>Fitzflam winked at the irregularity, and retreated.</p>

<p>Duberly lighted a cigar with the cartel, and puffed
away vigorously.</p>

<!-- page 91 -->

<p>"What's to be done?&mdash;marry, or be shot! I don't
like either&mdash;at least, I've come to no conclusion on the
subject. When I've made up my mind, I'll let 'em
know&mdash;plenty of time."</p>

<p>No notice being taken of the challenge, Mr. Julius St.
Simon Sapsago assaulted Mr. Doubtington in the street
with a horsewhip, while Fitzflam stood by to enjoy the
sport. There is nothing like a smart external application
to quicken the mental faculties, and so our hero found it.</p>

<p>"Stop!" said he, dancing <i>&agrave; la Celeste</i>.</p>

<p>"You're a scoundrel!" cried Julius, and the whip
cracked merrily.</p>

<p>"I've made up my mind!" replied Duberly, suddenly
shooting his clenched fist into the countenance of the
flagellating Julius, who turned a backward summerset
over a wheelbarrow. Fitzflam lost his hat in an abrupt
retreat up the street, and he was fortunate in his swiftness,
for, "had all his hairs been lives," Duberly would
have plucked them.</p>

<p>But, from this moment, the star of Duberly Doubtington
began to wane. The case of Sapsago <i>versus</i> Doubtington,
for breach of promise of marriage, made heavy
inroads upon his fortune. His new man of business,
who took the responsibility of managing his money
affairs without pestering him for directions, sunk the
whole of his cash in the Bubble and Squeak Railroad and
Canal Company, incorporated with banking privileges.
Doubtington, therefore, for once was resolute, and turned
politician; and in this capacity it was that he called upon
Mr. Edax Rerum for his influence to procure him an
office. He still lives in the hope of a place, but, unluckily
for himself, can never make up his mind on which
side to be zealous until the crisis is past and zeal is
useless.</p>

<!-- page 92 -->

<p>His last performance was characteristic. Having
escorted the Hon. Phinkey Phunks to the steamboat, the
vessel began to move before he had stepped ashore.
He stood trembling on the brink. "Jump, you fool!"
said a jarvey.&mdash;"Take keer&mdash;it's too fur!" said a newspaper
boy. The advice being balanced, Doubtington
was perplexed, and, making a half step, as the distance
widened, he plumped into the river. He was fished out
almost drowned, and, as he stood streaming and wo-begone
upon the wharf, while other less liquid patriots earned
golden opinions by shouting, "Hurrah for Phunks!"
imagination could scarcely conceive a more appropriate
emblem of the results of indecision than that presented
by Duberly Doubtington, a man who, had it been left to
himself, would never have been in the world at all.</p>

<p>DILLY JONES;</p>

<p class="small">OR, THE PROGRESS OF IMPROVEMENT.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>ONE of the most difficult things in the world is to run
before the wind; and, by judiciously observing the
changes of the weather, to avoid being thrown out.
Fashion is so unsteady, and improvements are so rapid,
that the man whose vocation yields him an abundant
harvest now, may, in a few years, if he has not a keen
eye, and a plastic versatility, find that his skill and his
business are both useless. Many were the poor barbers
shipwrecked by the tax upon hair-powder, and numerous
were the leather breeches maimers who were destroyed
by the triumph of woollens. Their skill was doubtless
very great, but it would not avail in a contest against the
usages of the world; and unless they had the capacity
to strike out a new course, they all shared the fate of
their commodities, and retired to the dark cellars of popular
estimation. Every day shows us the same principle
of change at work, and no one has more reason to reflect
and mourn about it than one Dilly Jones of this city.
Dilly is not, perhaps, precisely the person who would be
chronicled by the memoir writers of the time, or have a
monument erected to him if he were no more; but Dilly
is a man of a useful though humble vocation, and no one
can saw hickory with more classic elegance, or sit upon

<!-- page 94 -->

the curbstone and take his dinner with more picturesque
effect.</p>

<p>Yet, as has been hinted above, Dilly has his sorrows,
particularly at night, after a hard day's work, when his
animal spirits have been exhausted by reducing gum logs
to the proper measure. In the morning he is full of life
and energy, feeling as if he could saw a cord of Shot-towers,
and snap the pillars of the Bank across his knee
like pipe stems. In the full flush of confidence at that
time of day, reflection batters against him in vain; but
as the night draws on, Dilly feels exhausted and spiritless.
His enthusiasm seems to disappear with the sun,
and neither the moon nor the stars can cause high tide in
the river of his mind. The current of his good spirits
shrinks in its channel, leaving the gay and gorgeous
barques of hope and confidence drearily ashore on the
muddy flats; and his heart fails him as if it were useless
longer to struggles against adversity.</p>

<p>It was in this mood that he was once seen travelling
homeward, with his horse and saw fixed scientifically
upon his shoulders. He meandered in his path in the
way peculiar to men of his vocation, and travelled with
that curvilinear elegance which at once indicates that he
who practises it is of the wood-sawing profession, and
illustrates the lopsided consequences of giving one leg
more to do than the other. But Dilly was too melancholy
on this occasion to feel proud of his professional
air, and perhaps, had he thought of it, would have reproved
the leg which performed the "sweep of sixty,"
for indulging in such graces, and thereby embarrassing
its more humble brother, which, knowing that a right
line is the shortest distance between two places, laboured
to go straight to its destination. Dilly, however, had no

<!-- page 95 -->

such stuff in his thoughts. His mind was reasoning from
the past to the future, and was mournfully meditating
upon the difficulties of keeping up with the changes of
the times, which roll onward like a Juggernaut, and crush
all who are not swift enough to maintain themselves in
the lead. He wondered why fashions and customs
should so continually change, and repined that he could
not put a spoke in their wheel, that the trade of one's
early days might likewise be the trade of one's latter
years. So complete was his abstraction that he unconsciously
uttered his thoughts aloud:</p>

<p>"Sawing wood's going all to smash," said he, "and
that's where every thing goes what I speculates in. This
here coal is doing us up. Ever since these black stones
was brought to town, the wood-sawyers and pilers, and
them soap-fat and hickory-ashes men, has been going
down; and, for my part, I can't say as how I see what's
to be the end of all their new-fangled contraptions. But
it's always so; I'm always crawling out of the little end
of the horn. I began life in a comfortable sort of a way;
selling oysters out of a wheelbarrow, all clear grit, and
didn't owe nobody nothing. Oysters went down slick
enough for a while, but at last cellars was invented, and
darn the oyster, no matter how nice it was pickled, could
poor Dill sell; so I had to eat up capital and profits myself.
Then the 'pepree pot smoking' was sot up, and
went ahead pretty considerable for a time; but a parcel
of fellers come into it, said my cats wasn't as good as
their'n, when I know'd they was as fresh as any cats in
the market; and pepree pot was no go. Bean soup was
just as bad; people said kittens wasn't good done that
way, and the more I hollered, the more the customers
wouldn't come, and them what did, wanted tick. Along
with the boys and their pewter fips, them what got trust

<!-- page 96 -->

and didn't pay, and the abusing of my goods, I was soon
fotch'd up in the victualling line&mdash;and I busted for the
benefit of my creditors. But genius riz. I made a raise
of a horse and saw, after being a wood-piler's prentice
for a while, and working till I was free, and now here
comes the coal to knock this business in the head. My
people's decent people, and I can't disgrace 'em by turning
Charcoal Jemmy, or smashing the black stones with
a pickaxe. They wouldn't let me into no society at all
if I did."</p>

<p>The idea of being excluded from the upper circles of
the society in which he had been in the habit of moving,
fell heavily upon the heart of poor Dilly Jones. He
imagined the curled lips and scornful glances of the aristocratic
fair, who now listened with gratification to his
compliments and to his soft nonsense; he saw himself
passed unrecognised in the street&mdash;absolutely cut by his
present familiar friends, and the thought of losing caste
almost crushed his already dejected spirit.</p>

<p>The workings of his imagination, combined with the
fatigue of his limbs, caused such exhaustion, that, dislodging
his horse from his shoulder, he converted it into
a camp-stool, seated himself under the lee of a shop
window, and, after slinging his saw petulantly at a dog,
gazed with vacant eyes upon the people who occasionally
passed, and glanced at him with curiosity.</p>

<p>"Hey, mister!" said a shop-boy, at last, "I want to
get shut of you, 'cause we're goin' to shet up. You're
right in the way, and if you don't boom along, why Ben
and me will have to play hysence, clearance, puddin's out
with you afore you've time to chalk your knuckles&mdash;won't
we, Ben?"</p>

<p>"We'll plump him off of baste before he can say fliance,
or get a sneak. We're knuckle dabsters, both on us.

<!-- page 97 -->

You'd better emigrate&mdash;the old man's coming, and if he
finds you here, he'll play the mischief with you, before
you can sing out 'I'm up if you knock it and ketch.' "</p>

<p>So saying, the two lads placed themselves one on each
side of Dilly, and began swinging their arms with an expression
that hinted very plainly at a forcible ejectment.
Dilly, however, who had forgotten all that he ever knew
of the phrases so familiar to those who scientifically understand
the profound game of marbles, wore the puzzled
air of one who labours to comprehend what is said to him.
But the meaning became so apparent as not to be mistaken,
when Ben gave a sudden pull at the horse which
almost dismounted the rider.</p>

<p>"Don't be so unfeelin'," ejaculated Dilly, as he clutched
the cross-bars of his seat; "don't be unfeelin', for a
man in grief is like a wood-piler in a cellar&mdash;mind how
you chuck, or you'll crack his calabash."</p>

<p>"Take care of your calabash then," was the grinning
response; "you must skeete, even if you have to cut
high-dutchers with your irons loose, and that's no
fun."</p>

<p>"High-dutch yourself, if you know how; only go
'way from me, 'cause I ain't got no time."</p>

<p>"Well," said the boys, "haven't we caught you
on our payment?&mdash;what do you mean by crying here&mdash;what
do you foller when you're at home?"</p>

<p>"I works in wood; that's what I foller."</p>

<p>"You're a carpenter, I s'pose," said Ben, winking at
Tom.</p>

<p>"No, not exactly; but I saws wood better nor any
half dozen loafs about the drawbridge. If it wasn't for
grief, I'd give both of you six, and beat you too the best
day you ever saw, goin' the rale gum and hickory&mdash;for I
don't believe you're gentlemen's sons; nothin' but poor

<!-- page 98 -->

trash&mdash;half and half&mdash;want to be and can't, or you
wouldn't keep a troubling of me."</p>

<p>"Gauley, Ben, if he isn't a wharf-rat! If you don't
trot, as I've told you a'ready, boss will be down upon
you and fetch you up like a catty on a cork-line&mdash;jerk!"</p>

<p>"That's enough," replied Dilly; "there's more places
nor one in the world&mdash;at least there is yet; new fashions
haven't shut up the streets yet, and obligated people
to hire hackney balloons if they want to go a walkin', or
omnibus boardin' houses when they want a fip's worth
of dinner, or a levy's worth of sleep. Natural legs is
got some chance for a while anyhow, and a man can get
along if he ain't got clock-vurks to make him go.</p>

<p>"I hope, by'm'by," added Dill scornfully, as he
marched away from the chuckling lads, "that there
won't be no boys to plague people. I'd vote for that
new fashion myself. Boys is luisances, accordin' to
me."</p>

<p>He continued to soliloquize as he went, and his last
observations were as follows:</p>

<p>"I wonder, if they wouldn't list me for a Charley?
Hollering oysters and bean soup has guv' me a splendid
woice; and instead of skeering 'em away, if the thieves
were to hear me singing out, my style of doing it would
almost coax 'em to come and be took up. They'd feel
like a bird when a snake is after it, and would walk up,
and poke their coat collars right into my fist. Then, after
a while, I'd perhaps be promoted to the fancy business of
pig ketching, which, though it is werry light and werry
elegant, requires genus. 'Tisn't every man that can come
the scientifics in that line, and has studied the nature of
a pig, so as to beat him at can&oelig;uvering, and make him
surrender 'cause he sees it ain't no use of doing nothing.
It wants larning to conwince them critters, and it's only

<!-- page 99 -->

to be done by heading 'em up handsome, hopping which
ever way they hop, and tripping 'em up genteel by
shaking hands with their off hind leg. I'd scorn to pull
their tails out by the roots, or to hurt their feelin's by
dragging 'em about by the ears.</p>

<p>"But what's the use? If I was listed, they'd soon find
out to holler the hour and to ketch the thieves by steam;
yes, and they'd take 'em to court on a railroad, and try
'em with biling water. They'll soon have black locomotives
for watchmen and constables, and big bilers for judges
and mayors. Pigs will be ketched by steam, and will be
biled fit to eat before they are done squealing. By and
by, folks won't be of no use at all. There won't be no
people in the world but tea kettles; no mouths, but safety
valves; and no talking, but blowing off steam. If I had
a little biler inside of me, I'd turn omnibus, and weekdays
I'd run from Kensington to the Navy Yard, and
Sundays I'd run to Fairmount."</p>

<p>THE FLESHY ONE.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">" 'Twas fat, not fate, by which Napoleon fell."</p>

</div>

<p>THERE is a little man in a sister city&mdash;there are little
men in most cities&mdash;but the one now on the tapis is a peculiar
little man&mdash;a fat little man. He is one who may be
described as a person about five feet&mdash;five feet high and
very nearly five feet thick, bearing much resemblance to
a large New England pumpkin stuck upon a pair of beets.
When he lies down to sleep, were it not for his nose at
one extremity and his toes at the other, the spectator
would naturally suppose that he was standing upright
under the cover. When he descends the stairs, he might
as well roll on his side as fatigue himself with walking;
and, as for tumbling down as other people tumble down,
that is out of the question with Berry Huckel, or Huckel
Berry, as he is sometimes called, because of his roundness.
Should he, however, chance to trip,&mdash;which he is
apt to do, not being able to reconnoitre the ground in the
vicinity of his feet,&mdash;before he achieves a fair start from
the perpendicular, his "corporosity" touches the ground
which his hands in vain attempt to reach, and he remains,
until helped up, in the position of a schoolboy stretching
himself over a cotton bale. Had he been the Lucius
Junius of antiquity, the Pythia would never have been
so silly as to advise him to kiss his mother earth; for

<!-- page 101 -->

unless his legs are tilted up by some one like the handles
of a wheelbarrow, Berry Huckel can never bite the dust.
He cannot fall on his nose&mdash;that glorious privilege has
been denied to men of his periphery; but when enjoying
moderate serenity of mind, he is always able to sleep
o' nights, therein having no trifling advantage over your
Seurats, your Edsons, your walking anatomies, whose
aspect is a reproach to those who have the feeding of
them.</p>

<p>But biographical accuracy, and a desire that future
generations may not be misled as to those important facts
which make up the aggregate of history, render it necessary
to avow that these fleshy attributes worry Mr. Berry
Huckel. He cannot look upon the slender longitude of
a bean-pole, he cannot observe the attenuated extent of a
hop-stick, or regard the military dandyism of a greyhound's
waist, without experiencing emotions of envy,
and wishing that he had himself been born to the same
lankiness of figure, the same emaciation of contour. He
rejoices not in his dimensions, and, contrary to all rules
in physical science, believes that what he gains in weight,
he loses in importance. It must, however, be confessed
that he has some reason for discontent. He cannot wear
shoes, for he must have assistance to tie them, and other
fingers than his own to pull them up at heel. Boots are
not without their vexations, although he has a pair of
long hooks constructed expressly for his own use; and
should a mosquito bite his knee&mdash;which mosquitoes are
apt to do&mdash;it costs him a penny to hire a boy to scratch
it. Berry is addicted to literature, and once upon a time
could write tolerable verses, when he was thin enough to
sit so near a table as to be able to write upon it. But this
is not the case at present. His body is too large, and his
arms too short, for such an achievement.</p>

<!-- page 102 -->

<p>It is happily so arranged that the mind of man in
general accommodates itself to circumstances. We
become reconciled to that which is beyond remedy,
and at length scarcely bestow a thought upon subjects
which, when new, were sources of much disquietude and
annoyance. In fact, owing to the compensating principle
so often acted on by nature, it is by no means rare to
find vanity flourishing most luxuriantly in those who
have least cause to entertain the feeling. The more
numerous our defects, the greater is our self-satisfaction,
and thus the bitterness and discontent that might be
engendered by a knowledge that in mental or in physical
gifts we are far inferior to the majority of mankind,
are harmlessly and pleasantly prevented. Who so happy
as the simpleton, who is unconscious of any difference
between himself and the superior spirits with whom he
is thrown in contact, and who would smilingly babble
his <i>niaiseries</i> in the presence of the assembled wisdom
of the world? Who look more frequently or with
greater delight into the mirror, than they who have in
truth but little reason to be gratified with the object it
reflects?&mdash;and who indulge more in personal adornment
than they in whom it would be the best policy to avoid
display, and to attract the least possible attention to their
outward proportions? The ugly man is apt to imagine
that the fair are in danger of being smitten with him at first
sight, and perhaps&mdash;but we do not pretend to much
knowledge on this branch of the subject, though suspecting,
contrary to the received opinion, that the masculine
gender are much more liable to the delusions of conceit
than the softer sex, and that the guilty, having a more
perfect command of the public ear, have in this instance,
as in many others, charged their own sins upon the
guiltless&mdash;perhaps plain women are to a certain extent

<!-- page 103 -->

subject to the same imputation. But who, even if he had
the power, would be so unfeeling as to dissolve the charm
and dissipate the "glamour" which is so potent in making
up the estimate, when we sit in judgment on ourselves?
Who, indeed, could do it safely?&mdash;for every one is
indebted to the witchery of self-deception for no small
portion of the comfortable sensations that strew flowers
on his path through life; and it would be the
height of cruelty if the "giftie" desired by Burns were
accorded, enabling us to "see oursels as ithers see us."
It was&mdash;had it been carried out to its full extent&mdash;an
unkind offer, that of Cassius to play the moral looking-glass
to his brother conspirator, and "show that to
himself which he yet knew not of." If true and unrelenting
in its office, such a looking-glass would be in
danger of a fracture, and it would have the alternatives
of being either considered as a malicious exaggerator, or
as a mere falsifier that delights to wound.</p>

<p>But digression is a runaway steed,&mdash;all this bears but
slantingly on Berry Huckel, and they who love not
generalizing, may substitute for it the individual specification
that, owing to the comforting operation of custom,
even Berry might not have troubled himself on the score
of the circumstantial and substantial fat by which he is
enveloped, had it not been that in addition to an affection
for himself, he had a desire that he should be equally
esteemed by another. In short, Berry discovered, like
many other people, that his sensibilities were expansive
as well as his figure&mdash;that it was not all sufficient to
happiness to love one's self, and that his heart was more
than a sulky, being sufficient to carry two. Although so
well fenced in, his soul was to be reached, and when
reached, it was peculiarly susceptible of soft impressions.
"The blind bow-boy's butt-shaft" never had a better mark.

<!-- page 104 -->

<p>In love, however, like does not consort with like
either in complexion, in figure, or in temper, or each
race would preserve its distinct lineage with the regularity
of the stripes upon the tartan. The fiery little
man&mdash;little men are almost always fiery, a fact which
can only be accounted for on the theory, that whether the
individual be big or little, he contains the same quantity
of the electro-magnetism of vitality, or in other words, of
the spirit of life,&mdash;this spirit in a large body, having a
greater amount of matter to animate, cannot afford to
flash and blaze except on extraordinary occasions&mdash;while,
being superabundant in the smaller figure, it has
a surplus on hand, which stimulates to restlessness and
activity, engenders warmth and irritability of temper,
and is always ready for explosion&mdash;thus, the fiery little
man is apt to become attached to beauty upon a large
scale. He loves by the ton, and will have no idol but
one that he must look up to. By such means the petulance
of diminutiveness is checked and qualified by the
phlegmatic calmness and repose of magnitude. The
walking tower, on the contrary, who shakes the earth
with his ponderous tread, dreams of no other lady-love
except those miniature specimens of nature's handiwork,
who move with the lightness of the gossamer, and seem
more like the creation of a delightful vision than tangible
reality. In this, sombre greatness asks alleviation from
the butterfly gayety which belongs to the figure of fairy
mould. The swarthy bend the knee to those of clear
and bright complexion, and your Saxon blood seeks the
"dark-eyed one" to pay its devotions. The impulse of
nature leads to those alliances calculated to correct faults
on both sides, and to prevent their perpetuity. The
grave would associate with the gay, the short pine for
the tall, the fat for the lean, the sulky for the sunny&mdash;the

<!-- page 105 -->

big covet the little; and, if our philosophy be not
always borne out by the result, it is because circumstance
or accident counteracts instinct, or that the cases cited
form exceptions to the rule without impairing its force.
A true theorist always leaves the wicket of escape open
behind him.</p>

<p>At all events, Berry Huckel was in the strictest conformity
to the rule. His affections were set upon lathiness,
and if he could not fall in love, he certainly contrived
to roll himself into it.</p>

<p>He was indulging himself in a walk on a pleasant day,
and, as usual, was endeavouring to dance along and to
skip over the impediments in the path, for the purpose
of persuading himself that he was a light and active
figure, and that if any change were going on in his corporal
properties, it was a favourable one, when an event
occurred which formed an era in his life. He twirled
his little stick,&mdash;a big one would have looked as if he
needed support,&mdash;and, pushing a boy with a basket aside,
attempted to hop over a puddle which had formed on the
crossing at the corner of the street. The evolution,
however, was not so skilfully achieved as it would have
been by any one of competent muscle who carried less
weight. Berry's foot came down "on the margin of
fair Zurich's waters," and caused a terrible splash,
sending the liquid mud about in every direction.</p>

<p>"Phew!" puffed Berry, as he recovered himself, and
looked with a doleful glance at the melancholy condition
in which his vivacity had left his feet.</p>

<p>"Splut!" ejaculated the boy with the basket, as he
wiped the mud out of his eyes. "Jist let me ketch you
up our alley, that's all, puddy-fat!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" shrieked Miss Celestina Scraggs, a very tall
lady, and particularly bony, as she regarded the terrible

<!-- page 106 -->

spots and stains with which Berry had disfigured her
dress: "what a pickle!"</p>

<p>Berry turned round at the voice of a female in distress,
and the sight of her went to his heart like an arrow.
Miss Celestina Scraggs was precisely his beau ideal of
what a woman should be&mdash;not perhaps in countenance,
but her figure was the very antipodes of his own, and he
felt that his time was come. As for face and a few more
years than are desirable, Berry cared not, if the lady were
tall enough and thin enough, and in the individual before
him he saw both those qualities combined.</p>

<p>"My dear madam," said Berry, ducking his head
after the semblance of a bow, and raising his hat with a
graceful curve&mdash;"my dear madam, I beg ten thousand
pardons. Allow me, if you please," continued he, observing
that she paid no attention to his speech, and was
attempting to shake off the looser particles of mud, an
operation in which Berry ventured to assist.</p>

<p>"Let me alone, sir&mdash;I wonder at your impudence,"
was the indignant reply, and Miss Celestina Scraggs
floated onward, frowning indignantly, and muttering as
she went&mdash;"First splash a body, and then insult a body!
Pretty pickle,&mdash;nice situation! fat bear!"</p>

<p>Berry remained in attitude, his hat in one hand and
his handkerchief with which he would have wiped the
injured dress in the other. The scorn of the lady had
no other effect on him than that of riveting his chains.</p>

<p>"Hip-helloo, you sir!" shouted an omnibus driver
from his box, as he cracked his whip impatiently;
"don't stand in the middle of the street all day a blockin'
up the gangvay, or I'll drive right over you&mdash;blamenation
if I don't!"</p>

<p>"Shin it, good man!" ejaculated a good-natured
urchin; "shin it as well as you know how!"</p>

<!-- page 107 -->

<p>The qualification was a good one, Berry not being
well calculated for a "shinner" of the first class. So
starting from his revery, he hastened to escape "as well
as he knew how," and, placing his hat once more upon
his head, he resolved to follow the injured lady to ascertain
her residence, and to devise ways and means of
seeking her favour under better auspices. He hurried
up the street with breathless haste, forming a striking
resemblance to the figure which a turtle would present
if walking a match against time on its hinder flippers.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Passing over intermediate circumstances, it will
suffice to say that Mr. Berry Huckel discovered the
residence of Miss Scraggs, and that, by perseverance, he
obtained an introduction according to etiquette. The
more he saw of her the more thoroughly did he become
fascinated; but Miss Scraggs showed no disposition to
receive his suit with any symptoms of favour. She
scornfully rejected his addresses, chiefly because, although
having no objection to a moderate degree of plumpness,
his figure was much too round to square with her ideas
of manly beauty and gentility of person. In vain did he
plead the consuming passion, which, like the purest
anthracite with the blower on, flamed in his bosom and
consumed his vitals. Miss Scraggs saw no signs of
spontaneous combustion in his jolly form; and Miss
Scraggs, who is "as tall and as straight as a poplar tree,"
declared that she could not marry a man who would
hang upon her arm like a bucket to a pump. That he
was not a grenadier in height might have been forgiven;
but to be short and "roly-poly" at the same time! Miss
Seraphina Scraggs could not think of it&mdash;she would
faint at the idea.</p>

<p>Berry became almost desperate. He took lessons on

<!-- page 108 -->

the flute, and trolled forth melancholy lays beneath the
lady's casement, to try the effect of dulcet sounds upon a
hard heart; but having been informed from a neighbouring
window that fifer-boys were not wanted in that
street, and that no nuisances would be tolerated, he
abandoned music in despair; and having consulted a
physician as to the best method of reducing corpulency,
he went to the Gymnasium, and endeavoured to climb
poles and swing upon bars for hours at a time. But the
unhappy Berry made but little progress, and in his
unskilful efforts having damaged his nose and caused
temporary injury to the beauty of his frontispiece, he
gave up the design of making himself an athlete by that
species of exercise. For sparring, he found that he had
no genius at all, his wind being soon exhausted, and his
body being such pleasant practice that his opponents
never knew when to be done hitting at one whose frame
gave no jarring to the knuckles. It was, however, picturesque
to see Berry with the gloves on, accoutred for
the fray, and squaring himself to strike and parry at his
own figure in the glass. Deliberation and the line of
beauty were in all his movements. Not obtaining his
end in this way, he tried dieting and a quarter at
dancing school; but short-commons proved too disagreeable,
and his gentle agitations to the sound of the fiddle,
as he <i>chassez'd</i>, <i>coupez'd</i>, <i>jetez'd</i>, and <i>balancez'd</i> only
increased his appetite and added to his sorrows. Besides,
his landlady threatened to discharge him for
damaging the house, and alarming the sleepers by his
midnight repetitions of the lessons of the day. As he
lay in bed wakeful with thought, he would suddenly, as
he happened to remember that every moment was of
importance for the reduction of his dimensions, slide out
upon the floor, and make tremendous efforts at a performance

<!-- page 109 -->

of the "pigeon-wing," each thump resounding
like the report of a cannon, and causing all the glasses
in the row to rattle as if under the influence of an earthquake.
On one occasion indeed&mdash;it was about two
o'clock in the morning&mdash;the whole house was roused by
a direful, and, until then, unusual uproar in the chamber
of Berry Huckel&mdash;a compound of unearthly singing and
of appalling knocks on the floor. The boldest, having
approached the door to listen, applied their ears to the
keyhole, and heard as follows: "Turn out your toes&mdash;forward
two&mdash;tol-de-rol-tiddle (<i>thump</i>)&mdash;tiddle (<i>bump</i>)&mdash;twiddle
(<i>bang!</i>)&mdash;cross over&mdash;tiddle (<i>whack</i>)&mdash;twiddle
(<i>smack</i>)&mdash;tiddle (<i>crack</i>)&mdash;twiddle (<i>bang!</i>)"</p>

<p>(<i>Rap! rap! rap!</i>) "Good gracious, Mr. Huckel, what's
the meaning of all this?&mdash;are you crazy?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm dancing&mdash;<i>balancez!</i>&mdash;tiddle (<i>bump</i>)&mdash;tiddle
(<i>thump</i>)&mdash;tiddle (<i>bang!</i>)"</p>

<p>Crash! splash! went the basin-stand, and the boarders
rushing in, found Berry Huckel in "the garb of old
Gaul," stumbling amid the fragments he had caused by
his devotions to the graces. He was in disgrace for a
week, and always laboured under the imputation of
having been a little <i>non-com</i> on that occasion; but with
love to urge him on, what is there that man will not
strive to accomplish?</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Berry's dancing propensity led him to various balls
and hops; and on one of these occasions, he met Miss
Scraggs in all her glory, but as disdainful as ever.
After bowing to her with that respectful air, which
intimated that the heart he carried, though lacerated by
her conduct, was still warm with affection, he took a
little weak lemonade, which, as he expressed it, was the
appropriate tipple for gentlemen in his situation, and then

<!-- page 110 -->

placed himself immediately under the fiddlers, leaning
against the wall in a despairing attitude, arms carelessly-crossed,
a handkerchief dangling negligently from his
little finger, his, mouth half open, and his eyes now fixed
with resignation upon the ceiling, and anon dropping
misanthropically to the ground. The <i>tout ensemble</i>
was touching in the extreme, but Miss Scraggs only
smiled derisively when her eyes fell upon her dejected
lover.</p>

<p>Berry, however, finding that this would not do, cheered
himself with wine, and danced furiously at every opportunity.
Gracefully glided the dancers, merrily twinkled
their feet, and joyously squeaked the fiddles, as Berry,
late in the evening, panting with his previous Terpsichorean
exertions, resolved to have a chat with the obdurate
Seraphina, and solicited the honour of her fair hand
for the next set.</p>

<p>"Mons'us warm, miss," said Berry, by way of opening
the conversation in a novel and peculiarly elegant
way, "mons'us warm, and dancing makes it mons'usser."</p>

<p>"Very mons'us," replied Miss Scraggs, glancing at
him from head to foot with rather a satirical look, for
Miss Scraggs is disposed to set up for a wit; "very
mons'us, indeed. But you look warm, Mr. Huckel&mdash;hadn't
you better try a little punch? It will agree with
your figure."</p>

<p>"Punch!" exclaimed Berry, in dismay, as he started
back three steps&mdash;"Oh, Judy!"</p>

<p>He rushed to the refreshment room to cool his fever&mdash;he
snatched his hat from its dusky guardian, forgetting
to give him a "levy," and hurriedly departed.</p>

<p>It was not many hours afterwards that Berry&mdash;his love
undiminished, and his knowledge refreshed that gymnastics
are a remedy against exuberance of flesh&mdash;was seen

<!-- page 111 -->

with his hat upon a stepping stone in front of a house in
Chestnut street, labouring with diligence at jumping over
both the stone and the chapeau. But the heaviness of
his heart seemed to rob his muscles of their elasticity.
He failed at each effort, and kicked his hat into the
middle of the street.</p>

<p>"Phew!" said he, "my hat will be ruinationed to
all intents and purposes. Oh! if I wasn't so fat, I might
be snoozing it off at the rate of nine knots instead of
tiring myself to death. Fat ain't of no use, but on the
contrary. Fat horses, fat cows, and fat sheep are respected
accordin', but fat men are respected disaccordin'. Folks
laugh&mdash;the gals turn up their noses, and Miss Scraggs
punches my feelings with a personal insinuation. Punch!
oh my!&mdash;It's tiresome, to be sure, to jump over this 'ere,
but it's a good deal tiresomer to be so jolly you can't jump
at all, and can't even jump into a lady's affeckshins. So
here's at it agin. Warn'ee wunst! warn'ee twy'st!
warn'ee three times&mdash;all the way home!"</p>

<p>Berry stooped low, swinging his arms with a pendulum
motion at each exclamation, and was about assuming
the salient attitude of the pound of butter which Dawkins,
for want of a heavier missile, threw at his wife, when
he was suddenly checked by the arrival of a fellow
boarder, who exclaimed, "Why, Berry, what are you at?"</p>

<p>"Don't baulk, good man&mdash;I say, don't baulk&mdash;but now
you have done it, can you jump over that 'ere hat, fair
standing jump, with a brick in each hand&mdash;none of your
long runs and hop over?&mdash;kin you do it?&mdash;answer me
that!" queried Berry, as he blew in his hands, and then
commenced flapping his arms <i>&agrave; la</i> wood-sawyer.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I might&mdash;but it won't do for us to be cutting
rusties here at this time o' night. You had better sing
mighty small, I tell you."</p>

<!-- page 112 -->

<p>"Pooh! pooh! don't be redickalis. The doctor says
if I don't exercise, I'll be smothered; and Miss Scraggs
called me punch, and won't have me&mdash;I'm jumping for
my life, and for my wife too."</p>

<p>"You'd better go prentice to Jeames Crow," said
his friend Brom, dryly, "and learn the real scientifics."</p>

<p>"It would make me laugh," replied Berry, gravely;
"such as you can afford to laugh and get fat, but I
can't. I've jumped six fireplugs a' ready, and I'll jump
over that 'ere hat before I go home&mdash;I'm be blowed out
bigger if I don't. Now squat, Brom&mdash;squat down, and
see if I go fair. Warn'ee wunst&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're crazy!" answered Brom, losing all patience,
"you're a downright noncompusser. I haven't seen a
queerer fellow since the times of 'Zacchy in the meal-bag;'
and if you go on as you have lately, it's my
opinion that your relations shouldn't let you run at
large."</p>

<p>"That's what I complain of&mdash;I can't run any other
way than at large; but if you'll let me alone, I'll try to
jump myself smaller. So clear out, skinny, and let me
practyse. Warn'ee wunst!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'd better come home, and make no bones about
it."</p>

<p>"Bones! I ain't got any. I'm a boned turkey. If
you do make me go home, you can't say you boned me.
I've seen the article, but I never had any bones myself."</p>

<p>This was, to all appearance, true enough, but his
persecutor did not take the joke. Berry is, in a certain
sense, good stock. He would yield a fat dividend; but,
though so well incorporated, no "bone-us" for the privilege
is forthcoming.</p>

<!-- page 113 -->

<p>"Yes, you're fat enough, and I'm sorry to say, you're
queer enough too; queer is hardly a name for you. You
must be taken care of, and go home at once, or I'll call
assistance."</p>

<p>"Well, if I must, I must&mdash;that's all. But if I get the
popperplexy, and don't get Miss Scraggs, it's all your
fault. You won't let me dance in my chamber&mdash;you
won't let me jump over my hat&mdash;you won't let me do
nothing. I can't get behind the counter to tend the customers,
without most backing the side of the house out;
but what do you care?&mdash;and now you want me to get
fatter by going to sleep. By drat! I wouldn't wonder
if I was to be ten pounds heavier in the morning. If I
am, in the first place, I'll charge you for widening me and
spoiling my clothes; and then&mdash;for if I get fatter, Miss
Scraggs won't have me a good deal more than she won't
now, and my hopes and affeckshins will be blighteder than
they are at this present sitting&mdash;why, then, I'll sue you
for breach of promise of marriage."</p>

<p>"Come along. There's too many strange people
running about already. It's time you were thinned off."</p>

<p>"That's jist exactly what I want; I wish you could thin
me off," sobbed Berry, as he obeyed the order; but he
was no happier in the morning. Miss Seraphina Scraggs
continues obdurate, for her worst fears are realized. He
still grows fatter, though practising "warn'ee wunst"
at all convenient opportunities.</p>

<p>GARDEN THEATRICALS.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>MAN is an imitative animal, and consequently, the
distinguished success which has fallen to the lot of a few
of our countrymen in the theatrical profession, has had
a great effect in creating longings for histrionic honours.
Of late years, <i>debuts</i> have been innumerable, and it
would be a more difficult task than that prescribed by
Orozimbo&mdash;"to count the leaves of yonder forest"&mdash;if
any curious investigator, arguing from known to
unknown quantities, were to undertake the computation
of the number of Roscii who have not as yet been able
to effect their <i>coup d'essai</i>. In this quiet city&mdash;many
as she has already given to the boards&mdash;multitudes are
yet to be found, burning with ardour to "walk the
plank," who, in their prospective dreams, nightly hear
the timbers vocal with their mighty tread, and snuff the
breath of immortality in the imaginary dust which
answers to the shock. The recesses of the town could
furnish forth hosts of youths who never thrust the left
hand into a Sunday boot, preparatory to giving it the last
polish, without jerking up the leg thereof with a Kean-like
scowl, and sighing to think that it is not the well
buffed gauntlet of crook'd Richard&mdash;lads, who never don
their night gear for repose, without striding thus attired
across their narrow dormitory, and for the nonce, believing
themselves accoutred to "go on" for Rolla, or

<!-- page 115 -->

the Pythagorean of Syracuse&mdash;two gentlemen who promenade
in "cutty sarks," and are as indifferent about
rheumatism as a Cupid horsed upon a cloud.</p>

<p>But in the times of which we speak, stage-struck
heroes were rare. The theatrical mania was by no
means prevalent. It went and came like the influenza,
sometimes carrying off its victims; but they
were not multitudinous. Our actors were chiefly importations.
The day of native talent was yet in the
gray of its morning&mdash;a few streakings or so, among the
Tressels and Tyrells, but nothing tip-topping it in the
zenith. There are, however, few generalities without
an exception, and in those days, Theodosius Spoon had
the honour to prove the rule by being an instance to the
contrary.</p>

<p>Theodosius Spoon&mdash;called by the waggish <i>Tea-spoon</i>,
and supposed by his admirers to be born for a stirring
fellow&mdash;one who would whirl round until he secured for
himself a large share of the sugar of existence&mdash;Theodosius
Spoon was named after a Roman emperor&mdash;not
by traditional nomenclature, which modifies the effect of
the thing, but directly, "out of a history book" abridged
by Goldsmith. It having been ascertained, in the first
place, that the aforesaid potentate, with the exception of
having massacred a few thousand innocent people one
day, was a tolerably decent fellow for a Roman emperor,
he was therefore complimented by having his name
bestowed upon a Spoon. It must not, however, be
thought that the sponsors were so sanguine as to entertain
a hope that their youthful charge would ever reach
the purple. Their aspirations did not extend so far; but
being moderate in their expectations, they acted on the
sound and well established principle that, as fine feathers
make fine birds, fine names, to a certain extent, must

<!-- page 116 -->

have an analogous effect&mdash;that our genius should be
educed, as it were, by the appellation bestowed upon
us; and that we should be so sagaciously designated that
to whatever height fortune leads, fame, in speaking of
us, may have a comfortable mouthful, and we have no
cause under any circumstances to blush for our name.
Mr. and Mrs. Spoon&mdash;wise people in their way&mdash;reasoned
in the manner referred to. They were satisfied
that a sonorous handle to one's patronymic acts like a
balloon to its owner, and that an emaciated, every-day,
threadbare cognomen&mdash;a Tom, Dick, and Harry denomination&mdash;is
a mere dipsey, and must keep a man at the
bottom. Coming to the application of the theory, they
were satisfied that the homely though useful qualities
of the spoon would be swallowed up in the superior
attributes of Theodosius. That this worthy pair were
right in the abstract is a self-evident proposition. Who,
for instance, can meet with a Napoleon Bonaparte Mugg,
without feeling that when the said Mugg is emptied of
its spirit, a soul will have exhaled, which, had the gate
of circumstance opened the way, would have played
foot-ball with monarchs, and have wiped its brogues
upon empires? An Archimedes Pipps is clearly born to
be a "screw," and to operate extensively with "burning
glasses," if not upon the fleets of a Marcellus, at least
upon his own body corporate. While Franklin Fipps,
if in the mercantile line, is pretty sure to be a great flier
of kites, and a speculator in vapours, and such like fancy
stocks. If the Slinkums call their boy C&aelig;sar, it follows
as a natural consequence that the puggish disposition of
the family nose will, in his case, gracefully curve into the
aquiline, and that the family propensity for the Fabian
method of getting out of a scrape, will be C&aelig;sarised into
a valour, which at its very aspect would set "all Gaul"

<!-- page 117 -->

into a quake. Who can keep little Diogenes Doubikens
out of a tub, or prevent him from scrambling into a
hogshead, especially if sugar is to be gathered in the
interior? Even Chesterfield Gruff is half disposed to be
civil, if he thinks he can gain by so unnatural a course
of proceeding; and everybody is aware that Crichton
Dunderpate could do almost any thing, if he knew how,
and if, by a singular fatality, all his fingers were not
thumbs.</p>

<p>Concurrent testimony goes to prove that the son of a
great man is of necessity likewise great&mdash;the children of
a <i>blanchisseuse</i>, or of a house-scrubber, have invariably
clean hands and faces; schoolmasters are very careful
to imbue their offspring with learning; and, if we are not
mistaken, it has passed into a proverb that the male progeny
of a clergyman, in general, labour hard for the
proud distinction of being called "hopeful youths and
promising youngsters." The corollary, therefore, flows
from this, as smoothly as water from a hydrant, that he
who borrows an illustrious name is in all probability
charged to the brim, ipso facto, with the qualities whereby
the real owner was enabled to render it illustrious&mdash;qualities,
which only require opportunity and the true position
to blaze up in spontaneous combustion, a beacon to
the world. And thus Theodosius Spoon, in his course
through life, could scarcely be otherwise than, if not an
antique Roman, at least an "antic rum 'un;" his sphere
of action might be circumscribed, but he could not do
otherwise than make a figure.</p>

<p>Our Spoon&mdash;his parents being satisfied with giving
him an euphonious name&mdash;was early dipped into the broad
bowl of the world to spoon for himself. He was apprenticed
to a shoemaker to learn the art and mystery of
stretching "uppers" and of shaping "unders." But,

<!-- page 118 -->

for this employment, as it was merely useful and somewhat
laborious, he had no particular fancy. Whether it
was owing to the influence of his name or not, we cannot
pretend to say, but, like Jaffier and many other worthy
individuals, he was much troubled with those serious inconveniences
termed "elegant desires." Young as he
was, his talent for eating was aldermanic; aristocracy
itself might have envied his somnolent performances in
the morning; while, if fun or mischief were afoot, no
watch dog could better encounter prolonged vigils, and
no outlying cat could more silently and skilfully crawl
in at a back window than he, when returning from his
nocturnal perambulations. His genius for lounging, likewise,
when he should have been at work, was as remarkable
as his time-consuming power when sent on an
errand. He could seem to do more, and yet perform less,
than any lad of his inches in the town; and, being ordered
out on business, it was marvellous to see the swiftness
with which he left the shop, and the rapidity of his immediate
return to it, contrasted with the great amount of
time consumed in the interval. With these accomplishments,
it is not surprising that Theodosius Spoon was
discontented with his situation. He yearned to be an
embellishment&mdash;not a plodding letter, valuable only
in combination, but an ornamental flourish, beautiful
and graceful in itself; and, with that self-reliance peculiar
to genius, he thought that the drama opened a short
cut to the summit of his desires. Many a time, as he
leaned his elbow on the lapstone, and reposed his chin
upon his palm, did his work roll idly to the floor,
while he gazed with envious eyes through the window
at the playbills which graced the opposite corner, and
hoped that the time would come when the first night of
Theodosius Spoon would be thereupon announced in

<!-- page 119 -->

letters as large as if he were a histrionic ladle. Visions
of glory&mdash;of crowded houses&mdash;of thundering plaudits&mdash;of
full pockets&mdash;of pleasant nights, and of day lounges up
and down Chestnut street, the wonder of little boys and
the focus of all eyes,&mdash;floated vividly across his imagination.
How could he, who bore the name of a Roman
emperor, dream of being elsewhere that at the topmost
round of fortune's ladder, when he had seen others there,
who, subjected to mental comparison, were mere rushlights
compared to himself?</p>

<p>Filled with these gorgeous imaginings, our Spoon
became metamorphosed into a spout, pouring forth
streams of elocution by night and by day, and, though
continually corking his frontispiece to try the expression
in scenes of wrath, it soon became evident that his
powers could not remain bottled in a private station.
When a histrionic inclination ferments so noisily that its
fizzling disturbs the neighbourhood, it requires little
knowledge of chemistry to decide that it must have vent,
or an explosion will be the consequence; and such was
the case in the instance of which we speak. The
oratorical powers of Theodosius Spoon were truly
terrible, and had become, during the occasional absence
of the "boss," familiar to every one within a square.</p>

<p>An opportunity soon afforded itself.&mdash;Those Philadelphians,
who were neither too old nor too young, when
Theodosius Spoon flourished, to take part in the amusements
of the town, do not require to be told that for the
delectation of their summer evenings, the city then
rejoiced in a Garden Theatre, which was distinguished
from the winter houses by the soft Italian appellation of
the Tivoli. It was located in Market near Broad street,
in those days a species of <i>rus in urbe</i>, improvement
not having taken its westward movement; and before its

<!-- page 120 -->

brilliancy was for ever extinguished, the establishment
passed through a variety of fortunes, furnishing to the
public entertainment as various, and giving to the stage
many a "regular" whose first essay was made upon its
boards.</p>

<p>At this period, so interesting to all who study the
history of the drama, lived one Typus Tympan, a
printer's devil, who "cronied" with Spoon, and had been
the first to give the "reaching of his soul" an inclination
stageward. Typus worked in a newspaper office, where
likewise the bills of the Garden Theatre were printed,
and, <i>par consequence</i>, Typus was a critic, with the
<i>entr&eacute;e</i> of the establishment, and an occasional order for
a friend. It was thus that Spoon's genius received the
Promethean spark, and started into life. By the patronising
attentions of Typus, he was no longer compelled
to gaze from afar at the members of the company as they
clustered after rehearsal, of a sunny day, in front of the
theatre, and varied their smookings by transitions from
the "long nine" to the real Habana, according to the
condition of the treasury, or the state of the credit system.
Our hero now nodded familiarly to them all, and by dint
of soleing, heel-tapping, and other small jobs in the leather
way, executed during the periods of "overwork" for Mr.
Julius Augustus Winkins, was admitted to the personal
friendship of that illustrious individual. Some idea of the
honour thus conferred may be gathered from the fact
that Mr. Winkins himself constituted the entire male
department of the operatic corps of the house. He
grumbled the bass, he warbled the tenor, and, when
necessary, could squeak the "counter" in beautiful perfection.
All that troubled this magazine of vocalism
was that, although he could manage a duet easily enough,
soliloquizing a chorus was rather beyond his capacity, and

<!-- page 121 -->

he was, therefore, often compelled to rely upon the
audience at the Garden, who, to their credit be it spoken,
scarcely needed a hint upon such occasions. On opera
nights, they generally volunteered their services to fill
out the harmony, and were so abundantly obliging, that
it was difficult to teach them where to stop. In his
private capacity&mdash;when he was <i>ex officio</i> Winkins&mdash;he did
the melancholico-Byronic style of man&mdash;picturesque, but
"suffering in his innards,"&mdash;to the great delight of all the
young ladies who dwelt in the vicinity of the Garden.
When he walked forth, it was with his slender frame
inserted in a suit of black rather the worse for wear, but
still retaining a touching expression, softened, but not
weakened, by the course of time. He wore his shirt
collars turned down over a kerchief in the "fountain
tie," about which there is a Tyburn pathos, irresistible
to a tender heart; and with his well oiled and raven
locks puffed out <i>en masse</i> on the left side of his head,
he declined his beaver over his dexter eye until its brim
kissed the corresponding ear. A profusion of gilt chain
travelled over his waistcoat, and a multitude of rings of
a dubious aspect encumbered his fingers. In this interesting
costume did Julius Augustus Winkins, in his
leisure moments, play the abstracted, as he leaned gracefully
against the pump, while obliquely watching the
effect upon the cigar-making demoiselles who operated
over the way, and who regarded Julius as quite a love,
decidedly the romantic thing.</p>

<p>Winkins was gracious to Spoon, partly on the account
aforesaid, and because both Spoon and Tympan were
capital <i>claqueurs</i>, and invariably secured him an encore,
when he warbled "Love has eyes," and the other
rational ditties in vogue at that period.</p>

<p>Now it happened that business was rather dull at the

<!-- page 122 -->

Garden, and the benefit season of course commenced.
The hunting up of novelties was prosecuted with great
vigour; even the learned pig had starred at it for once;
and as the Winkins night approached, Julius Augustus
determined to avail himself of Spoon for that occasion,
thinking him likely to draw, if he did not succeed, for in
those days of primitive simplicity first appearances had
not ceased to be attractive. The edge not being worn
off, they were sure to be gratifying, either in one way
or the other.</p>

<p>It was of a warm Sunday afternoon that this important
matter was broached. Winkins, Spoon, and Tympan
sat solacing themselves in a box at the Garden,
puffing their cigars, sipping their liquid refreshment, and
occasionally nibbling at three crackers brought in upon
a large waiter, which formed the substantial of the
entertainment. The discourse ran upon the drama.</p>

<p>"Theo, my boy!" said Winkins, putting one leg on
the table, and allowing the smoke to curl about his nose,
as he cast his coat more widely open, and made the
accost friendly.</p>

<p>"Spoon, my son!" said Winkins, being the advance
paternal of that social warrior, as he knocked the ashes
from his cigar with a flirt of his little finger.</p>

<p>"Spooney, my tight 'un!"&mdash;the assault irresistible,&mdash;"how
would you like to go it in uncle Billy Shakspeare,
and tip the natives the last hagony in the tragics?"
Winkins put his other leg on the table, assuming an
attitude both of superiority and encouragement.</p>

<p>"Oh, gammin!" ejaculated Spoon, blushing, smiling,
and putting the forefinger of his left hand into his mouth.
"Oh, get out!" continued he, casting down his eyes
with the modest humility of untried, yet self-satisfied
genius.</p>

<!-- page 123 -->

<p>"Not a bit of it&mdash;I'm as serious as an empty barn&mdash;got
the genius&mdash;want the chance&mdash;my benefit&mdash;two acts
of any thing&mdash;cut mugs&mdash;up to snuff&mdash;down upon 'em&mdash;fortune
made&mdash;that's the go."</p>

<p>"It's our opinion,&mdash;we think, Theodosius," observed
Typus Tympan, with editorial dignity, as he emphatically
drew his cuff across the lower part of his countenance,
"we think, and the way we know what's what,
because of our situation, is sing'ler&mdash;standing, as we
newspaper folks do, on the shot tower of society&mdash;that
now's your time for gittin' astraddle of public opinion,
and for ridin' it like a hoss. Jist such a chance as
you've been wantin'. As the French say, all the <i>bew
mundy</i> come to Winkins's benefit; and if the old man
won't go a puff leaded, why we'll see to havin' it sneaked
in, spread so thick about genius and all, that it will
draw like a blister&mdash;we will, even if we get licked for it."</p>

<p>" 'Twon't do," simpered Spoon, as he blushed brown,
while the expression of his countenance contradicted his
words. " 'Twon't do. How am I to get a dress&mdash;s'pose
boss ketches me at it? Besides, I'm too stumpy for
tragedy, and anyhow I must wait till I'm cured of my
cold."</p>

<p>"It will do," returned Winkins, decisively; "and
tragedy's just the thing. There are, sir, varieties in tragedy&mdash;by
the new school, it's partitioned off in two
grand divisions. High tragedy of the most helevated
description," (Winkins always <i>haspirated</i> when desirous
of being emphatic,) "high tragedy of the most helevated
and hexalted kind should be represented by a gentleman
short of statue, and low comedy should be sustained by
a gentleman tall of statue. In the one case, the higher
the part, the lowerer the hactor, and in the other case,
<i>wisey wersy</i>. It makes light and shade between the

<!-- page 124 -->

sentiment and the performer, and jogs the attention by
the power of contrast. The hintellectual style of playing
likewise requires crooked legs."</p>

<p>"We think, then, our friend is decidedly calkilated to
walk into the public. There's a good deal of circumbendibus
about Spoon's gams&mdash;he's got serpentine trotters&mdash;splendid
for crooked streets, or goin' round a corner,"
interpolated Typus, jocularly.</p>

<p>"There's brilliancy about crooked legs," continued
Winkins, with a reproving glance at Typus. "The monotony
of straight shanks answers well enough for genteel
comedy and opera; but corkscrew legs prove the mind
to be too much for the body; therefore, crooked legs,
round shoulders, and a shovel nose for the heccentricities
of the hintellectual tragics. Audiences must have
it queered into 'em; and as for a bad cold, why it's a
professional blessing in that line of business, and saves a
tragedian the trouble of sleeping in a wet shirt to get a
sore throat. Blank verse, to be himpressive, must be
frogged&mdash;it must be groaned, grunted, and gasped&mdash;bring
it out like a three-pronged grinder, as if body and soul
were parting. There's nothing like asthmatic elocution
and spasmodic emphasis, for touching the sympathies and
setting the feelings on edge. A terrier dog in a pucker
is a good study for anger, and always let the spectators
see that sorrow hurts you. There's another style of tragedy&mdash;the
physical school&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That must be a dose," ejaculated Typus, who was
developing into a wag.</p>

<p>"But you're not big enough, or strong enough for
that. A physical must be able to outmuscle ten blacksmiths,
and bite the head off a poker. He must commence
the play hawfully, and keep piling on the hagony
till the close, when he must keel up in an hexcruciating

<!-- page 125 -->

manner, flip-flopping it about the stage as he defuncts,
like a new caught sturgeon. He should be able to hagonize
other people too, by taking the biggest fellow in the
company by the scuff of the neck, and shaking him at
arm's length till all the hair drops from his head, and
then pitch him across, with a roar loud enough to break
the windows. That's the menagerie method. The physical
must always be on the point of bursting his boiler,
yet he mustn't burst it; he must stride and jump as if he
would tear his trousers, yet he mustn't tear 'em; and
when he grabs anybody, he must leave the marks of his
paws for a week. It's smashing work, but it won't do
for you. Spooney; you're little, black-muzzled, queer
in the legs, and have got a cold; nature and sleeping with
the windows open have done wonders in making you fit
for the hintellectuals, and you shall tip 'em the sentimental
in Hamlet."</p>

<p>Parts of this speech were not particularly gratifying
to Spoon; but, on the whole, it jumped with his desires,
and the matter was clinched. Winkins trained him;
taught him when and where to come the "hagony;"
when and where to cut "terrific mugs" at the pit; when
and where to wait for the applause, and how to <i>chassez</i>
an exit, with two stamps and a spring, and a glance
<i>en arriere</i>.</p>

<p>Not long after, the puff appeared as Typus promised.
The bills of the "Garden Theatre" announced the
Winkins benefit, promising, among other novelties, the
third act of Hamlet, in which a young gentleman, his
first appearance upon any stage, would sustain the character
of the melancholy prince. Rash promise! fatal
anticipation!</p>

<p>The evening arrived, and the Garden was crowded.
All the boys of the trade in town assembled to witness

<!-- page 126 -->

the <i>debut</i> of a brother chip, and many came because others
were coming. Winkins, in a blue military frock, buttoned
to the chin, white pantaloons strapped under the
foot, and gesticulating with a shining black hat with
white lining, borrowed expressly for the occasion, had
repeated "My love is like the red, red rose" with
immense applause, when the curtain rang up, and the
third act began.</p>

<p>The tedious prattle of those who preceded him being
over, Theodosius Spoon appeared. Solemnly, yet with
parched lips and a beating heart, did he advance to the
footlights, and duck his acknowledgments for the applause
which greeted him. His <i>abord</i>, however, did not
impress his audience favourably. The black attire but
ill became his short squab figure, and the "hintellectual
tragicality of his legs," meandering their brief extent,
like a Malay creese, gave him the aspect of an Ethiopian
Bacchus dismounted from his barrel. Hamlet resembled
the briefest kind of sweep, or "an erect black tadpole
taking snuff."</p>

<p>With a fidelity to nature never surpassed, Hamlet
expressed his dismay by scratching his head, and, with
his eyes fixed upon his toes, commenced the soliloquy,&mdash;another
beautiful conception,&mdash;for the prince is supposed
to be speaking to himself, and his toes are as well
entitled to be addressed as any other portion of his personal
identity. This, however, was not appreciated by
the spectators, who were unable to hear any part of the
confidential communication going on between Hamlet's
extremities.</p>

<p>"Louder, Spooney!" squeaked a juvenile voice, with
a villanous twang, from a remote part of the Garden.
"Keep a ladling it out strong! Who's afeard?&mdash;it's only
old Tiwoly!"</p>

<!-- page 127 -->

<p>"Throw it out!" whispered Winkins, from the wing.
"Go it like a pair of bellowses!"</p>

<p>But still the pale lips of Theodosius Spoon continued
quivering nothings, as he stood gasping as if about to
swallow the leader of the fiddlers, and alternately raising
his hands like a piece of machinery. Ophelia advanced.</p>

<p>"Look out, bull-frog, there comes your mammy.
Please, ma'am, make little sonny say his lesson."</p>

<p>Bursts of laughter, shouts, and hisses resounded
through the Garden. "Whooror for Spooney!" roared
his friends, as they endeavoured to create a diversion in
his favour&mdash;"whooror for Spooney! and wait till the
skeer is worked off uv him!"</p>

<p>"How vu'd you like it?" exclaimed an indignant
Spooneyite to a hissing malcontent; "how vu'd you
like it fur to have it druv' into you this 'ere vay? Vot kin
a man do ven he ain't got no chance?"</p>

<p>As the hisser did but hiss the more vigorously on
account of the remonstrance, and, jumping up, did it
directly in the teeth of the remonstrant, the friend to
Spooney knocked him down, and the <i>parquette</i> was soon
in an uproar. "Leave him up!" cried one&mdash;"Order!
put 'em down, and put 'em out!" The aristocracy of
the boxes gazed complacently upon the grand set-to
beneath them, the boys whacked away with their clubs
at the lamps, and hurled the fragments upon the stage,
while Ophelia and Hamlet ran away together.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," exclaimed Winkins, as he
rushed upon the stage, dragging after him "the rose and
the expectancy of the fair state," the shrinking Theodosius,&mdash;"will
you hear me for a moment?"</p>

<p>"Hurray for Vinkins!" replied a brawny critic,
taking his club in both hands, as he hammered against
the front of the boxes; "Vinkey, sing us the Bay uv

<!-- page 128 -->

Viskey, and make bull-frog dance a hornspike to the tune
uv it. Hurray! Twig Vinkey's new hat&mdash;make a
speech, Vinkey, fur your vite trousers!"</p>

<p>At length, comparative silence being restored, Mr.
Winkins, red with wrath, yet suppressing his rage,
delivered himself as follows&mdash;at times adroitly dodging
the candle ends, which had been knocked from the main
chandelier, and were occasionally darted at him and his
<i>proteg&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, permit me (<i>dodge</i>) respectfully
to ask one question. Did you (<i>dodge</i>) come here
to admire the beauties of the drama, (<i>successive dodges to
the right and left,</i>) or am I to (<i>dodge, dodge</i>) to understand
that you came solely to kick up a bloody row?"</p>

<p>The effect of this insinuating query had scarcely time
to manifest itself, before <i>Monsieur le directeur en chef</i>, a
choleric Frenchman, who made a profitable mixture of
theatricals, ice cream, and other refreshments, suddenly
appeared in the flat, foaming with natural anger at the
results of the young gentleman's <i>debut</i>. Advancing
rapidly as the "kick" rang upon his ear, he suited the
action to the word, and, by a dexterous application of his
foot, sent Winkins, in the attitude of a flying Mercury,
clear of the orchestra, into the midst of the turbulent
crowd in the pit. Three rounds of cheering followed this
achievement, while Theodosius gazed in pallid horror at
the active movement of his friend.</p>

<p>"Kick, aha! Is zat de kick, monsieur dam hoomboog?
Messieurs et mesdames, lick him good&mdash;sump
him into fee-penny beets! Sacre!" added the enraged
manager, turning toward Theodosius, "I sail lick de
petit hoomboog ver' good&mdash;sump him bon, nice, moimeme&mdash;by
me ownsef."</p>

<p>But the alarmed Theodosius, though no linguist,

<!-- page 129 -->

understood enough of this speech not to tarry for the
consequences, and climbing into the boxes, while the
angry manager clambered after him, he rushed through
the crowd, and in the royal robes of Denmark hurried
home.</p>

<p>For the time, at least, he was satisfied that bearing the
name of a Roman emperor did not lead to instant success
on the stage, and though he rather reproached the
audience with want of taste, it is not probable that he
ever repeated the attempt; for he soon, in search of an
"easy life," joined the patriots on the Spanish main, and
was never after heard of.</p>

<p>PETER BRUSH,</p>

<p class="small">THE GREAT USED UP.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>IT was November; soon after election time, when a
considerable portion of the political world are apt to be
despondent, and external things appear to do their utmost
to keep them so. November, the season of dejection,
when pride itself loses its imperious port; when ambition
gives place to melancholy; when beauty hardly
takes the trouble to look in the glass; and when existence
doffs its rainbow hues, and wears an aspect of such
dull, commonplace reality, that hope leaves the world
for a temporary excursion, and those who cannot do
without her inspiring presence, borrow the aid of pistols,
cords, and chemicals, and send themselves on a longer
journey, expecting to find her by the way:&mdash;a season,
when the hair will not stay in curl; when the walls weep
dewy drops, to the great detriment of paper-hangings,
and of every species of colouring with which they are
adorned; when the banisters distil liquids, any thing
but beneficial to white gloves; when nature fills the
ponds, and when window-washing is the only species of
amusement at all popular among housekeepers.</p>

<p>It was on the worst of nights in that worst of seasons.
The atmosphere was in a condition of which it is difficult
to speak with respect, much as we may be disposed to
applaud the doings of nature. It was damp, foggy, and

<!-- page 131 -->

drizzling; to sum up its imperfections in a sonorous and
descriptive epithet, it was " 'orrid muggy weather." The
air hung about the wayfarer in warm, unhealthy folds,
and extracted the starch from his shirt collar and from
the bosom of his dickey, with as much rapidity as it robbed
his spirits of their elasticity, and melted the sugar of
self-complacency from his mind. The street lamps
emitted a ghastly white glare, and were so hemmed in
with vapory wreaths, that their best efforts could not
project a ray of light three feet from the burner. Gloom
was universal, and any change, even to the heat of Africa,
or to the frosts of the arctic circle, would, in comparison,
have been delightful. The pigs' tails no longer
waved in graceful sinuosities; while the tail of each
night-roving, hectoring bull-dog ceased flaunting toward
the clouds, a banner of wrath and defiance to punier creatures,
and hung down drooping and dejected, an emblem
of a heart little disposed to quarrel and offence. The
ornamentals of the brute creation being thus below par,
it was not surprising that men, with cares on their shoulders
and raggedness in their trousers, should likewise
be more melancholy than on occasions of a brighter
character. Every one at all subject to the "skiey influences,"
who has had trouble enough to tear his clothes,
and to teach him that the staple of this mundane existence
is not exclusively made up of fun, has felt that philosophy
is but a barometrical affair, and that he who is
proof against sorrow when the air is clear and bracing,
may be a very miserable wretch, with no greater cause,
when the wind sits in another quarter.</p>

<p>Peter Brush is a man of this susceptible class. His
nervous system is of the most delicate organization, and
responds to the changes of the weather, as an &AElig;olian
harp sings to the fitful swellings of the breeze. Peter

<!-- page 132 -->

was abroad on the night of which we speak; either
because, unlike the younger Brutus, he had no Portia
near to tell him that such exposure was "not physical,"
and that it was the part of prudence to go to bed, or that,
although aware of the dangers of miasma to a man of his
constitution, he did not happen at that precise moment
to have access to either house or bed; in his opinion,
two essential pre-requisites to couching himself, as he
regarded taking it <i>al fresco</i>, on a cellar door, not likely
to answer any sanitary purpose. We incline ourselves
to the opinion that he was in the dilemma last mentioned,
as it had previously been the fate of other great men.
But be that as it may, Mr. Peter Brush was in the street,
as melancholy as an unbraced drum, "a gib-ed cat, or
a lugged bear."</p>

<p>Seated upon the curb, with his feet across the gutter,
he placed his elbow on a stepping-stone, and like Juliet
on the balcony, leaned his head upon his hand&mdash;a hand
that would perhaps have been the better of a covering,
though none would have been rash enough to volunteer
to be a glove upon it. He was in a dilapidated condition&mdash;out
at elbows, out at knees, out of pocket, out of office,
out of spirits, and out in the street&mdash;an "out and outer"
in every respect, and as <i>outr&eacute;</i> a mortal as ever the eye of
man did rest upon. For some time, Mr. Brush's reflections
had been silent. Following Hamlet's advice, he
"gave them an understanding, but no tongue;" and he
relieved himself at intervals by spitting forlornly into
the kennel. At length, suffering his locked hands to
fall between his knees, and heaving a deep sigh, he
spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A long time ago, my ma used to put on her specs
and say, 'Peter, my son, put not your trust in princes;'
and from that day to this I haven't done any thing of the

<!-- page 133 -->

kind, because none on 'em ever wanted to borry nothing
of me; and I never see a prince or a king,&mdash;but one or
two, and they had been rotated out of office,&mdash;to borry
nothing of them. Princes! pooh!&mdash;Put not your trust
in politicianers&mdash;them's my sentiments. You might jist
as well try to hold an eel by the tail. I don't care which
side they're on, for I've tried both, and I know. Put
not your trust in politicianers, or you'll get a hyst.</p>

<p>"Ten years ago it came into my head that things
weren't going on right; so I pretty nearly gave myself
up tee-totally to the good of the republic, and left the
shop to look out for itself. I was brimfull of patriotism,
and so uneasy in my mind for the salivation of freedom,
I couldn't work. I tried to guess which side was going
to win, and I stuck to it like wax;&mdash;sometimes I was
a-one side, sometimes I was a-t'other, and sometimes I
straddled till the election was over, and came up jist in
time to jine the hurrah. It was good I was after; and
what good could I do if I wasn't on the 'lected side?
But, after all, it was never a bit of use. Whenever the
battle was over, no matter what side was sharing out the
loaves and the fishes, and I stepped up, I'll be hanged if
they didn't cram all they could into their own mouths,
put their arms over some, and grab at all the rest with
their paws, and say, 'Go away, white man, you ain't
capable.'&mdash;Capable! what's the reason I ain't capable?
I've got as extensive a throat as any of 'em, and I could
swallow the loaves and fishes without choking, if each
loaf was as big as a grindstone and each fish as
big as a sturgeon. Give Peter a chance, and leave him
alone for that. Then, another time when I called&mdash;'I
want some spoils,' says I; 'a small bucket full of spoils.
Whichever side gets in, shares the spoils, don't they?'
So they first grinned, and then they ups and tells me that

<!-- page 134 -->

virtue like mine was its own reward, and that spoils
might spoil me. But it was <i>no</i> spoils that spoilt me,
and <i>no</i> loaf and fish that starved me&mdash;I'm spoilt because
I couldn't get either. Put not your trust in politicianers&mdash;I
say it agin. Both sides used me jist alike. Here
I've been serving my country, more or less, these ten
years, like a patriot&mdash;going to town meetings, hurraing
my daylights out, and getting as blue as blazes&mdash;blocking
the windows, getting licked fifty times, and having more
black eyes and bloody noses than you could shake a
stick at, all for the common good, and for the purity of
our illegal rights&mdash;and all for what? Why, for nix. If
any good has come of it, the country has put it into her
own pocket, and swindled me out of my arnings. I can't
get no office! Republics is ungrateful! It wasn't reward
I was after. I scorns the base insinivation. I only
wanted to be took care of, and have nothing to do but to
take care of the public, and I've only got half;&mdash;nothing
to do! Being took care of was the main thing. Republics
<i>is</i> ungrateful; I'm swaggered if they ain't. This is
the way old sojers is served."</p>

<p>Peter, having thus unpacked his o'erfraught heart,
heaved a sigh or two, as every one does after a recapitulation
of their own injuries, and remained for a few
minutes wrapped in abstraction.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said he, mournfully, swaying his head
to and fro after the sagacious fashion of Lord Burleigh&mdash;"live
and learn&mdash;live and learn&mdash;the world's not what a
man takes it for before he finds it out. Whiskers grow
a good deal sooner than experience&mdash;genus and patriotism
ain't got no chance&mdash;heigh-ho!&mdash;But anyhow, a
man might as well be under kiver as out in the open air
in sich weather as this. It's as cheap laying down as it is
settin' up, and there's not so much wear and tear about it."

<!-- page 135 -->

<p>With a groan, a yawn, and a sigh, Peter Brush slowly
arose, and stretching himself like a drowsy lion, he
walked toward the steps of a neighbouring house. Having
reached the top of the flight, he turned about and looked
round with a scrutinizing glance, peering both up and
down the street, to ascertain that none of the hereditary
enemies of the Brushes were in the vicinity. Being
satisfied on that score, he prepared to enjoy all the comfort
that his peculiar situation could command. According
to the modern system of warfare, he carried no baggage
to encumber his motions, and was always ready to
bivouac without troublesome preliminaries. He therefore
placed himself on the upper step, so that he was
just within the doorway, his head reclining against one
side of it, and his feet braced against the other, blockading
the passage in a very effectual manner. He adjusted
himself in position as carefully as the Sybarite who was
annoyed at the wrinkle of a rose-leaf on his couch, grunting
at each motion like a Daniel Lambert at his toilet,
and he made minute alterations in his attitude several
times before he appeared perfectly satisfied that he had
effected the best arrangements that could be devised.
After reposing for a while as if "the flinty and steel
couch of war were his thrice-driven bed of down," he
moved his head with an exclamation of impatience at the
hardness of the wall, and taking his time-worn beaver,
he crumpled it up, and mollified the austerity of his bolster
by using the crushed hat as a pillow.</p>

<p>"That will do," ejaculated Brush, clasping his hands
before him, and twirling his thumbs; and he then closed
his eyes for the purpose of reflecting upon his condition
with a more perfect concentration of thought than can be
obtained when outward objects distract the mind. But
thinking in this way is always a hazardous experiment,

<!-- page 136 -->

whether it be after dinner, or in the evening; and Peter
Brush soon unwittingly fell into a troubled, murmuring
sleep, in which his words were mere repetitions of what
he had said before, the general scope of the argument
being to prove the received axiom of former times, that
republics do not distribute their favours in proportion to
services rendered, and that, in the speaker's opinion, they
are not, in this respect, much better than the princes against
whom his mother cautioned him. Such, at least, was
the conviction of Mr. Brush; at which he had arrived,
not by theory and distant observation, but by his own
personal experience.</p>

<p>It is a long lane which has no turning, and it is a long
sleep in the open air, especially in a city, which does not
meet with interruption. Brush found it so in this instance,
as he had indeed more than once before. Several
gentlemen, followed by a dog, arrived at the foot of the
steps, and, after a short conversation, dispersed each to
his several home. One, however, remained&mdash;the owner
of the dog&mdash;who, whistling for his canine favourite, took
out his night-key, and walked up the steps. The dog,
bounding before his master, suddenly stopped, and after
attentively regarding the recumbent Brush, uttered a
sharp rapid bark.</p>

<p>The rapidity of mental operations is such that it frequently
happens, if sleep be disturbed by external sounds,
that the noise is instantly caught up by the ear, and incorporated
with the subject of the dream&mdash;or perhaps a
dream is instantaneously formed upon the nucleus suggested
by the vibration of the tympanum. The bark of
the dog had one of these effects upon Mr. Brush.</p>

<p>"Bow! wow! waugh!" said the dog.</p>

<p>"There's a fellow making a speech against our side,"
muttered Peter; "but it's all talk&mdash;where's your facts?&mdash;print

<!-- page 137 -->

your speech in pamphlet form, and I'll answer it.
Hurray for us!&mdash;everybody else is rascals&mdash;nothing but
ruination when that fellow's principles get the upper
hand&mdash;our side for ever&mdash;we're the boys!"</p>

<p>"Be still, Ponto!" said the gentleman. "Now, sir,
be pleased to get up, and carry yourself to some other
place. I don't know which side has the honour of claiming
you, but you are certainly on the wrong side at
present."</p>

<p>"Don't be official and trouble yourself about other
people's business," said Brush, trying to open his eyes;
"don't be official, for it isn't the genteel thing."</p>

<p>"Not official! what do you mean by that? I shall be
very official, and trundle you down the steps if you are
not a little more rapid in your motions."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," responded Brush, as he wheeled
round in a sitting posture, and fronted the stranger&mdash;"very
well&mdash;be as sassy as you please&mdash;I suppose you've
got an office, by the way you talk&mdash;you've got one of
the fishes, though perhaps it is but a minny, and I ain't&mdash;but
if I had, I'd show you a thing or two. Be sassy, be
any thing, Mr. Noodle-soup. I don't know which side
you're on either, but I do know one thing&mdash;it isn't saying
much for your boss politicianer that he chose you when
I must have been on his list for promotion&mdash;that's all,
though you are so stiff, and think yourself pretty to look
at. But them that's pretty to look at ain't always good
'uns to go, or you wouldn't be poking here. Be off&mdash;there's
no more business before this meeting, and you
may adjourn. It's moved, seconded, and carried&mdash;pay the
landlord for the use of the room as you go."</p>

<p>The stranger, now becoming somewhat amused, felt a
disposition to entertain himself a little with Peter.</p>

<p>"How does it happen," said he, "that such a public

<!-- page 138 -->

spirited individual as you appear to be should find himself
in this condition? You've had a little too much of
the <i>stimulantibus</i>, I fear."</p>

<p>"I don't know Greek, but I guess what you mean,"
was the answer. "It's owing to the weather&mdash;part to
the weather, and part because republics is ungrateful;
that's considerable the biggest part. Either part is excuse
enough, and both together makes it a credit. When it's
such weather as this, it takes the electerizing fluid out
of you; and if you want to feel something like&mdash;do you
know what 'something like' is?&mdash;it's cat-bird, jam up&mdash;if
you want to feel so, you must pour a little of the electerizing
fluid into you. In this kind of weather you must
tune yourself up, and get rosumed, or you ain't good for
much&mdash;tuned up to concert pitch. But all that's a trifle&mdash;put
not your trust in politicianers."</p>

<p>"And why not, Mr. Rosum?"</p>

<p>"Why not! Help us up&mdash;there&mdash;steady she goes&mdash;hold
on! Why not?&mdash;look at me, and you'll see the why
as large as life. I'm the why you musn't put your trust
in politicianers. I'm a rig'lar patriot&mdash;look at my coat&mdash;I'm
all for the public good&mdash;twig the holes in my trousers.
I'm steady in my course, and I'm upright in my
conduct&mdash;don't let me fall down&mdash;I've tried all parties,
year in and year out, just by way of making myself
popular and agreeable; and I've tried to be on both sides
at once," roared Brush, with great emphasis, as he slipped
and fell&mdash;"and this is the end of it!"</p>

<p>His auditor laughed heartily at this striking illustration
of the results of the political course of Peter Brush, and
seemed quite gratified with so strong a proof of the danger
of endeavouring to be on two sides at once. He
therefore assisted the fallen to rise.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?"</p>

<!-- page 139 -->

<p>"No&mdash;I'm used to being knocked about&mdash;the steps
and the pavement are no worse than other people&mdash;they're
like politicianers&mdash;you can't put any trust in 'em.
But," continued Brush, drawing a roll of crumpled
paper from the crown of his still more crumpled hat&mdash;"see
here now&mdash;you're a clever fellow, and I'll get you
to sign my recommendation. Here's a splendid character
for me all ready wrote down, so it won't give you
any trouble, only to put your name to it."</p>

<p>"But what office does it recommend you for&mdash;what
kind of recommendation is it?"</p>

<p>"It's a circular recommend&mdash;a slap at any thing that's
going."</p>

<p>"Firing into the flock, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"That's it exactly&mdash;good character&mdash;fit for any fat
post either under the city government, the state government,
or the gineral government. Now jist put your
fist to it," added Peter, in his most persuasive tones, as
he smoothed the paper over his knee, spread it upon the
step, and produced a bit of lead pencil, which he first
moistened with his lips, and then offered to his interlocutor.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," was the laughing response; "it's too
dark&mdash;I can't see either to read or to write. But what
made you a politicianer? Haven't you got a trade?"</p>

<p>"Trade! yes," replied Brush, contemptuously; "but
what's a trade, when a feller's got a soul? I love my
country, and I want an office&mdash;I don't care what, so it's
fat and easy. I've a genus for governing&mdash;for telling people
what to do, and looking at 'em do it. I want to take
care of my country, and I want my country to take care
of me. Head work is the trade I'm made for&mdash;talking&mdash;that's
my line&mdash;talking in the streets, talking in the bar
rooms, talking in the oyster cellars. Talking is the

<!-- page 140 -->

grease for the wagon wheels of the body politic and the
body corpulent, and nothing will go on well till I've got
my say in the matter; for I can talk all day, and most
of the night, only stopping to wet my whistle. But
parties is all alike&mdash;all ungrateful; no respect for genus&mdash;no
respect for me. I've tried both sides, got nothing,
and I've a great mind to knock off and call it half a day.
I would, if my genus didn't make me talk, and think, and
sleep so much I can't find time to work."</p>

<p>"Well," said the stranger, "you must find time to go
away. You're too noisy. How would you like to go
before the mayor?"</p>

<p>"No, I'd rather not. Stop&mdash;now I think of it, I've
asked him before; but perhaps if you'd speak a good
word, he'd give me the first vacancy. Introduce me properly,
and say I want something to do shocking&mdash;no,
not something to do&mdash;I want something to get; my
genus won't let me work. I'd like to have a fat salary,
and to be general superintendent of things in general
and nothing in particular, so I could walk about the
streets, and see what is going on. Now, put my best
leg foremost&mdash;say how I can make speeches, and how I
can hurray at elections."</p>

<p>"Away with you," said the stranger, as he ran
up the steps, and opened the door. "Make no noise
in this neighbourhood, or you'll be taken care of soon
enough."</p>

<p>"Well, now, if that isn't ungrateful," soliloquized
Brush,&mdash;"keep me here talking, and then slap the door
right in my face. That's the way politicianers serve me,
and it's about all I'd a right to expect. Oh, pshaw!&mdash;sich
a world&mdash;sich a people!"</p>

<p>Peter rolled up his "circular recommend," put it in
his hat, and slowly sauntered away. As he is not yet

<!-- page 141 -->

provided for, he should receive the earliest attention of
parties, or disappointment may induce him to abandon
both, take the field "upon his own hook," and constitute
an independent faction under the name of the "Brush
party," the cardinal principle of which will be that peculiarly
novel impulse to action, hostility to all "politicianers"
who are not on the same side.</p>

<p>TO be thin-skinned may add to the brilliancy and to
the beauty of the complexion; but, as this world goes,
it is more of a disadvantage than a blessing. Where
there is so much scraping and shaving, the cuticle of a
rhinoceros is decidedly the most comfortable wear; and to
possess any of the senses beyond a certain degree of
acuteness may be regarded as a serious misfortune. It
opens the door to an infinite variety of annoyances.
There are individuals with noses as keen as that of a
beagle; but whether they derive more of pleasure or of
pain from the faculty, is a question easily answered when
the multiplicity of odors is called to mind. To be what
the Scotch term "nose-wise," sometimes, it is true,
answers a useful purpose, in preventing people in the
dark from drinking out of the wrong bottle, and from administering
the wrong physic; it has also done good
service in enabling its possessor to discover an incipient
fire; but such occasions for the advantageous employment
of the proboscis are not of every-day occurrence,
and, on the general average, its exquisite organization is
an almost unmitigated nuisance to him who is obliged
to follow from his cradle to his grave, a nose so delicately
constituted, so inconveniently hypercritical, so frequently
discontented, and so intolerably fastidious.</p>

<!-- page 143 -->

<p>They, likewise, who are gifted with that which is
technically termed a "fine ear," have sufferings peculiar
to themselves, and, like the king of Denmark, receive
their poison through the porches of the auricle. They
are the victims of sound. It is conceded that from good
music they derive pleasures of which the rest of the
world can form but a faint conception; but, notwithstanding
the rage for its cultivation, really good music is
not quite so plentiful as might be supposed, and the pain
inflicted on the "family of fine ear" by the inferior article
is not to be expressed in words. A discord passes
through them as freezingly as if it were a bolt of ice; a
flat note knocks them down like a mace; and, if the
vocalist flies into the opposite extreme, and indulges in
being a "little sharp," all the acids of the shop could not
give the unhappy critic a more vinegar aspect, or more
effectually set his teeth on edge. To him a noise is not
simply a noise in the concrete; the discriminating
powers of his tympanum will not suffer him, as it were,
to lump it as an infernal clatter. Like a skilful torturer,
he analyzes the annoyance; he augments the pain by
ascertaining exactly why the cause is unpleasant, and by
observing the relative discordance of the components,
which, when united, almost drive him mad. The drum
and the fife, for instance, do very well for the world at
large; but "the man with the ear" is too often agonized
at perceiving how seldom it is that the drumstick
twirler braces his sheepskin to the proper pitch, and he
cannot be otherwise than excruciated at the piteous
squeaking of its imperfect adjunct&mdash;that "false one"
which is truly a warlike instrument, being studiously
and successfully constructed for offence, if not for defence.</p>

<p>Now it so happens that Matthew Minim is a man

<!-- page 144 -->

with an ear, his tympanum being a piece of most elaborate
workmanship. He could sing before he could talk,
and his early musical experiments were innumerable.
The first use he made of his teeth was to bite his nurse
for singing one strain of "hush-a-by-baby," in three
keys; and he could scarcely be prevailed upon to look at
his pa, because that respectable individual, with a perversity
peculiar to the incompetent, was always subjecting
poor "Hail Columbia" to the Procrustean bed of his
musical capabilities, and, while whistling to show his
own light-heartedness, did any thing but communicate
corresponding pleasure to his auditors.</p>

<p>"Screw it up, poppy," would little Minim exclaim,
with the expression of one upon the rack; "screw it up,
and keep it there. What's the use of chasing a tune all
about?"</p>

<p>But in some mouths a tune will run all about of itself,
let their lips be puckered ever so tightly, and there is no
composition of a popular nature which is so often heard
performing that erratic feat as the one familiarly termed
"Hail Curlumby." Matthew's "poppy," therefore, remained
a tune-chaser, while Matthew himself went on
steadily in the work of cultivating his ear, and of enlarging
his musical knowledge. He, of course, commenced
his studies with the flute, which may be regarded among
men and boys as the first letter of the alphabet in musical
education. He then amused himself with the fiddle&mdash;tried
the French horn for a season, varying the
matter by a few lessons upon the clarionet and hautboy,
and finally improving his powers of endurance by a little
practising of the Kent bugle. He at length became a
perfect melomaniac, and was always in danger of being
indicted as a nuisance by his less scientific neighbours,
whose ears were doomed to suffer both by night and by

<!-- page 145 -->

day. The twangling of stringed instruments was the
only relief they could obtain from the blasts of those
more noisy pieces of mechanism which receive voice
from the lips, and it has even been supposed that Matthew
Minim ranged his bugles, trumpets, and fiddles by
the side of his bed, that he might practise between
sleeps.<p>

<p>Not long since, Matthew Minim was returning from
a musical party late at night, and his friend Jenkinson
Jinks, who is likewise a votary of the divine art, was
with him. Minim carried his flute in a box under his
arm, and Jinks bore his fiddle in a bag on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Nature," observed Minim, "is the most perfect of
musicians; she never violates the rules of composition,
and though her performers are often noisy, yet, so long as
they attempt no more than is jotted down for them, they
are always in time and in tune. In fact, the world is one
great oratorio. Hark!&mdash;listen! throw aside vulgar prejudices,
and hear how chromatic and tender are the voices
of those cats in the kennel!&mdash;consider it as the balcony
scene from <i>Romeo e Giulietta</i>&mdash;how perfectly beautiful
that slide! how exact the concord between the rotund bass
notes of Thomas Cat, and the dulcet intonations of the
feminine pussy, and how sparkling the effect produced
by the contrast in the alternate passages! They are the
Fornasari and the Pedrotti of this moonlit scene. Bellini
himself, with all his flood of tenderness, never produced
any thing more characteristic, appropriate, and
touching; nor could the most accomplished artistes give
the idea of the composer with more fidelity."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Jenkinson Jinks, who was not altogether
capable of entering into the spirit of the refined
abstractions in which, after supper, his companion was
prone to indulge.</p>

<!-- page 146 -->

<p>"Ph-i-t!&mdash;ph-i-z!" exclaimed the cats, as they
scampered away in alarm at the approach of the musicians.</p>

<p>"<i>Staccato</i> and expressive in execution," said Jinks;
"but certainly not <i>stay-cat-o</i> in effect."</p>

<p>"Admirable!" remarked Minim&mdash;"Phit and phiz are
the exact phrase to express in short metre that it is time
to be off like a shot, and the notes in which they were uttered
are those best calculated to convey the sense of the
passage."</p>

<p>"A very rapid passage it was, too," added Jinks;
"quite a <i>roulade</i>&mdash;the performers are running divisions
up and down old Boodle's fence&mdash;a passage from the
oratorio of 'Mosey' perhaps."</p>

<p>"I bar punning," ejaculated Minim, impatiently; "and
to elucidate my theory upon the subject of natural music,
and to prove&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Cat</i>egorically?" inquired Jinks.</p>

<p>"Hush! To prove that the composer can have no better
study for the true expression of the passions and
emotions than is to be found in observing the animal
creation, I shall now proceed to kick this dog, which
lies asleep upon the pavement, and, without his being at
all aware of what I want, I shall extract from him a
heartrending passage in the minor key, expressive of
great dolor, and of a sad combination of mental and physical
discomfort."</p>

<p>"Stop!" hurriedly exclaimed Jinks, ensconcing himself
behind a tree; "before you give that <i>dog</i>matical
illustration, allow me to inform you that the dog before
you is old Boodle's Towser&mdash;he bites like fury."</p>

<p>"Bite!" replied Minim, contemptuously; "and what's
a bite in the cause of science, and in the exemplification
of the minor key?"</p>

<!-- page 147 -->

<p>Minim accordingly gave the dog a gentle push with his
foot.</p>

<p>"Ya-a-a-ah!" angrily and threateningly remonstrated
Towser, without moving.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;I told you so!" roared Jinks&mdash;"that's not
in the minor key&mdash;it's as military a major as ever I heard
in my life: when I listen to it, I can almost see you in
the shape of a cocked hat."</p>

<p>"Well, then, poke him with your fiddle," said Minim,
drawing back, and eying the dog rather suspiciously.
"Come away from the tree, and give Mr. Boodle's
Towser a jolly good punch."</p>

<p>"Not I," replied Jinks; "I've no notion of letting my
Cremona be chawed up <i>agitato</i> by an angry Towser&mdash;poke
him with your flute."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;stop&mdash;I'll get at him as it were slantindicularly&mdash;round
a corner," said Minim, retiring so that he was
partially protected by the flight of steps, from which
position he extended his leg, and dealt to Mr. Boodle's
Towser a most prodigious kick.</p>

<p>"Y-a-h! y-o-a-h!&mdash;b-o-o!" snarled the dog indignantly,
as he dashed round the corner to revenge the insult,
which was so direct and pointed that no animal of
spirit could possibly pass it over unnoticed.</p>

<p>Mr. Matthew Minim turned to fly, but he was not
quick enough, and the dog entered a detainer by seizing
him by the pantaloons.</p>

<p>"Get out!" shrieked Minim. "Take him off, Jinks,
or he'll eat me without salt!"</p>

<p>"Splendid illustration of natural music!" shouted
Jinks, clapping his hands in ecstasy; "<i>Con furore! Da
capo</i>, Towser!&mdash;<i>Volti subito</i>, Minim!&mdash;Music expressive
of tearing your breeches. I never saw a situation

<!-- page 148 -->

at once so picturesque, dramatic, and operatic. Why
don't you sing</p>

<p class="small">'<i>Oh, I cannot give expression<br/>

To this dog's deep felt impression?</i>'</p>

<p>for I'm sure, while he bites and you squeal, that he's
proving to your satisfaction how well nature understands
counterpoint. Bravo, Towser!&mdash;that's a magnificent
shake; but he won't let you favour us with a run,&mdash;will
he, Matthew?"</p>

<p>Towser held on determinedly, shaking his head and
growling fiercely, with his mouth full of pantaloons,
which, however, being very strong, did not give way and
suffer the distressed captive to escape.</p>

<p>"Hit him with a stick&mdash;get a big stone!" panted
Minim&mdash;"quit cracking jokes, for when the cloth goes
the horrid beast will take hold again&mdash;perhaps of my
flesh, and bite a piece right out!"</p>

<p>"Very likely&mdash;it's better eating than woollens; but
go on with your duet&mdash;don't mind me," added Jinks
quietly, as he looked about for a missile. Having found
one sufficiently heavy for his purpose, he took deliberate
aim, and threw it with such force that the angry animal
was almost demolished. On finding himself so violently
assailed, the dog relaxed his jaws and scampered down
the street, making the neighbourhood vocal with his cries.</p>

<p>"There, I told you," said Minim, settling his disordered
dress, and hoping, by taking the lead in conversation,
to avoid any hard-hearted reference to his misfortune&mdash;"I
told you he would sing out in the minor key, if he was
hurt. Hear that now&mdash;the dog is really heartrending."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Jinks, "he's quite a tearer of a dog&mdash;now
heartrending, and from the looks of your clothes,
he was a little while ago really breeches-rending. But
pick up your flute&mdash;the lecture upon natural music is
over for this evening."</p>

<!-- page 149 -->

<p>"Um!" growled Minim, discontentedly, as he took
up his hat and flute-box, and walked <i>dog</i>gedly forward.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Not a word was said while they walked several squares.
Peter was musing upon the cost of new pantaloons, and
Jinks chuckled to himself as he thought how capitally
the story about "natural music" would tell at a small
party.</p>

<p>A protracted silence, however, if men are not alone or
are not positively occupied, becomes wearisome and annoying,
and brings the nerves into unpleasant action.
Taciturnity, though commended, is after all but a
monkish virtue. Nature designed the human race to talk
when they are together&mdash;to be brightened and enlivened
by an interchange of sentiment; and while gratifying
themselves by exhibiting their old ideas, to be enriched
by the reception of new thoughts and fresh impressions.
So strong is the impulse, that there are many minds
which, under these circumstances, cannot continue a chain
of thought, and grow restless and impatient, in the belief
that the neighbour mind gives out nothing because it
waits for the lead, and is troubled for the want of it. The
silence therefore continues, the same idea prevailing on
both sides, and disabling each from tossing a subject into
the air, to elicit that volley of ideas or of words, as the
case may be, which constitutes conversation. The exemplification
is to be met with every day, and never
more frequently than in formal calls, when the parties
are not so well acquainted as to be able to find a common
topic on an emergency. He was not so much of
a simpleton as people think him, who said a foolish thing
during the excruciating period of an awkward pause,
merely for the purpose of "making talk." Every one
is familiar with plenty of instances, in which a Wamba

<!-- page 150 -->

"to make talk" would have been regarded as a blessing,
saving those present from the torture of cudgelling torpid
brains in vain, and from the annoyance of knowing that
each uncomfortable looking individual of the company,
though likewise cudgelling, regarded every other person
as remarkably stupid and unsocial.</p>

<p>From feelings analogous to those just mentioned, was
it that Jenkinson Jinks felt it incumbent upon him to
hazard an observation. He looked about for a cloud, but
there was none to be seen. He glanced at the stars, but
they were neither very bright nor very dim.</p>

<p>"Magnificent houses," said Jinks, at last, by way of
starting a leading fact, which was at once undeniable and
calculated to elicit a kindly response. The conscience
of Jinks rather reproached him with having laughed too
heartily at Minim's recent misadventure, and he therefore
selected a topic the least likely to afford opportunity
for a petulant reply, or to open the way to altercation.
Minim received the olive branch.</p>

<p>"Yes, but there's a grand mistake about this luxurious
edifice for instance," replied Minim; halting, and
leaning against a pump in front of a house which was
adorned with both a bell and a knocker, "the builder
has regarded the harmony of proportion, and all that&mdash;he
has made the proper distances between the windows
and doors,&mdash;the countenance, expression, and figure of
the house has been attended to; but I'm ready to bet,
without trying, that no one has thought of its voice&mdash;no
one has had the refined judgment to harmonize the bell
and the knocker, and, luckily for our nerves, knockers
are going out and have left the field to the bells. But,
where they remain, there's nothing but discord in the
vocal department; and if the servants have ears,&mdash;and
why should they not?&mdash;it must almost drive them distracted.

<!-- page 151 -->

Yes, yes&mdash;very pretty&mdash;fine steps, fine house,
bright knocker, glittering bell handle, and plenty of discord.
It's as sure as that the bell and knocker are there
in juxtaposition. To be morally certain, I'll try."</p>

<p>Up strode Matthew Minim to the top of the steps.</p>

<p>"Now, Jinks&mdash;out with your fiddle&mdash;it's up to concert
pitch&mdash;sound your A."</p>

<p>Jinks laughingly did as he was ordered, and after a
preliminary flourish, sounded orchestra fashion, "Twa-a-a&mdash;twawdle,
tweedle, twawdle&mdash;twa-a-a!"</p>

<p>"Taw-lol-tol-tee&mdash;tee-lol-tol-taw!" sang Minim, travelling
up and down the octave, to be sure of the pitch.
"Now, listen," and he rattled a stirring peal upon the
knocker. "That's not in tune with us no how you can
take it&mdash;is it, Jinks?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;twudle, tweedle, twudle, tweedle!" replied
Jinks, fiddling merrily, as he skipped about the pavement,
delighted with his own skill.</p>

<p>"Be quiet there&mdash;now, I'll try whether the bell and the
knocker are in tune with each other. Let's give 'em a
fair trial." So saying, Minim seized the knocker in
one hand, and the bell in the other, sounding them to
the utmost of his power.</p>

<p>"Oh, horrid! shameful! abominable!&mdash;even worse
than I thought&mdash;upon my word!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Halloo, below!" said a voice from the second story
window, emanating from a considerable quantity of night-cap
and wrapper; "what's the matter? Is it the Ingens,
or is the house afire?"</p>

<p>"I ain't a fireman myself, and I can't tell until the big
bell rings whether there's a fire or not," said Minim;
"but, if the house is positively on fire, I advise you as a
friend to come down, and leave it as soon as possible.
Bring your clothes, for the weather's not over warm."</p>

<!-- page 152 -->

<p>"Yes," said Jinks; "bring your trousers anyhow,
for we've only got one whole pair down here."</p>

<p>"You're a pair of impertinent rascals: what do you
mean by kicking up such a bobbery at this time of night?"</p>

<p>"Bobbery!&mdash;don't be cross, fiddle-strings; always be
harmonious in company, and melodious when you're
alone, especially when you snore. I merely wish to inform
you that your bell and knocker do not accord. Just
listen!"</p>

<p>Bell and knocker were both again operated on vigorously.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear the like? I'm ashamed of you&mdash;have
them tuned, do&mdash;it's dreadful. Tune 'em."</p>

<p>Once more Minim rang the bell and plied the knocker
with great vigour and strength of muscle, while Jinks
played "<i>Nel furor delle tempeste</i>," from Il Pirata.</p>

<p>The night-capped head disappeared from the window,
and the musical gentlemen stood chattering and laughing,
the one on the step and the other on the pavement, all
unconscious of the mischief that was brewing for them.</p>

<p>"Come," said Minim&mdash;"let's give these people a
duet&mdash;a serenade will enlarge their musical capacities."</p>

<p>"What shall it be?" queried Jinks, humming a succession
of airs, to find something suited to the occasion.</p>

<p>"Something about bells, if you don't know any thing
about knockers," added Minim, giving the bell handle
another affectionate tweak.</p>

<p>Just then, Meinherr Night-cap and Wrapper returned
to the window, aided by a stout servant, bearing a bucket
of water. "I'll not call the watch," chuckled he, "but
I'll teach these fellows how to swim."</p>

<p class="small">"<i>Home, fare thee well,<br/>

The ocean's storm is over</i>,"</p>

<p>sang Matthew Minim and Jenkinson Jinks.</p>

<!-- page 153 -->

<p>"Not over yet," said the voice from the window, as
Minim was drenched by the upsetting of the bucket&mdash;"take
care of the ground-swell!"</p>

<p>A spluttering, panting, and puffing sound succeeded,
like</p>

<p class="small">"<i>The bubbling shriek, the solitary cry<br/>

Of some strong swimmer in his agony</i>."</p>

<p>Jinks paddled off rapidly&mdash;he had seen enough of the
Cataract of the Ganges in former times: not so with Mr.
Minim, who exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Fire and fury! who asked for a water-piece? If
'Water parted' is your tune, you may stick to Arne, but
I'll give you a touch of Kotzwara&mdash;a specimen of the
'Battle of Prague,' with a little of the 'Hailstone
chorus.' "</p>

<p>Minim hammered away at the door; but not being
able to beat in the panels with his feet, he caught up a
paving-stone and hurled it against the frame, shouting
"Stony-batter!"</p>

<p>Windows flew up in all directions, and night-capped
heads projected from every embrasure. The people shouted,
the dogs barked, and rattles were sprung all round.
Never was there heard a less musical din.</p>

<p>Minim stood aghast. "Worse and worse!" cried he;
"what a clatter! Haydn's 'Chaos' was a fool to this!
It's natural music, however, and I'll play my part till I
get in, and catch the fellow who appointed himself the
watering committee;" and he, therefore, continued beating
upon the door.</p>

<p>Mr. Minim was, however, overpowered by a number
of individuals, headed by the bucket bearing servant,
and as his heels were tripped up, he mournfully remarked,</p>

<p>"So fell Cardinal Wolsey. Will nobody favour us

<!-- page 154 -->

with the 'Last words of Marmion,' or 'The soldier tired,'
'My lodging is on the cold ground,' or something else
neat and appropriate?"</p>

<p>"Can't you get somebody to bail you?" said a punning
individual, alluding to Mr. Minim's drenched condition.</p>

<p>"Let him run, Jacob," exclaimed the gentleman with
the night-cap, speaking from the window; "take him
round the corner, and give him a start. He is sufficiently
water-lynched, and I want no further trouble on his account."</p>

<p>"I won't go," replied Minim. "I've finished playing
for the night; but as you are leader, give the <i>coup d'archet</i>,
and set your orchestra in motion. I won't walk
round the corner&mdash;carry me&mdash;this must be a <i>sostenuto</i>
movement."</p>

<p>"Well, if that ain't a good note!" said the admiring
crowd, as Minim was transported round the corner,
whence, being set at liberty, he walked drippingly home,
and ever after confined his musical researches within
decorous bounds.</p>

<p>THEY who are at all mindful of atmospheric phenomena
must remember a storm, remarkable for its violence,
which occurred not long since. It was a storm by
night, and of those abroad at the time, every one averse
to the shower bath, and having a feline dislike to wet
feet, will bear it in mind, at least until the impression is
washed out by the floods of a greater tempest. In the
evening, the rain, as if exercising itself for more important
feats, fell gently and at intervals; but as the night
advanced, the wind came forth intent upon a frolic. Commencing
with playful gambols, it amused itself at first
with blowing out the old women's candles at the apple
stands. Then growing bolder, it extinguished a few
corporation lamps, and, like a mischievous boy, made
free to snatch the hats of the unguarded, and to whisk
them through mud and kennel. At length becoming wild
by indulgence, it made a terrible turmoil through the
streets, without the slightest regard to municipal regulations
to the contrary. It went whooping at the top of its
voice round the corners, whistled shrilly through the
key-holes, and howled in dismal tones about the chimney
tops. Here, it startled the negligent housewife from her
slumbers by slamming the unbolted shutter till it roared

<!-- page 156 -->

like a peal of artillery; and there, it tossed a rusty sign
until its ancient hinges creaked for mercy; while at
intervals, the heavy tumble of scantling told that when
Auster chooses to kick up a breeze, he is very nearly as
good at a practical joke as Boreas, or any other frolicsome
member of the &AElig;olian family. The clouds too
threw open their sluices, and the water joining in the
saturnalia, tried a variety of ways to amuse itself, and its
capers were as numerous as those of the gale. It beat
the tattoo upon the pavement with such sportive fury,
that it was difficult to decide whether it did not rain upward
as violently as it did downward. Anon the breeze
came sweeping along in a horizontal shower, disdaining
alike the laws of gravity, and the perpendicular, but more
hackneyed method of accomplishing its object. In short,
whether reference be had to wind or to water, it may be
noted in the journals of those curious in regard to weather,
as a night equally calculated to puzzle an umbrella,
and to render "every man his own washerwoman."</p>

<p>Selecting a single incident from the many, which it is
natural to suppose might have been found by the aid of a
diving bell on such a night, it becomes necessary to fish
up Ripton Rumsey, who happened to be abroad on that
occasion, as he is upon all occasions when left to consult
his own wishes. Where Ripton had been in the early
part of the evening, it would not have been easy either
for himself or any one else to tell. It is, therefore, fair
to infer that, distributing his attentions, he had been as
usual "about in spots." The fact is he has a hobby,
which, like many hobbies, is apt to throw its rider. Although
temperately disposed, such is the inquiring nature
of his philosophic spirit, that, with a view perhaps to
the ultimate benefit of the human race, he is continually
experimenting as to the effects of alcoholic stimulants

<!-- page 157 -->

upon the human frame. It is probable, therefore, that on
this occasion having "imbibed too much of the enemy"
neat as imported, he had walked forth to qualify it by a
stroll in the rain. This, however, is irrelevant, where
he was, is the point at issue.</p>

<p>The rain came down heavier than ever. A solitary
watchman, more amphibious than his race in general,
was seen wending his way through the puddles, thinking,
if he thought at all, of the discomforts of those whom
Noah left behind, and of that happy provision of nature
which renders a wet back fatal to none but young goslings.
Dodging between the drops was out of the question;
so he strode manfully onward, until he stumbled
over something which lay like a lion, or a bundle of wet
clothing, in his path.</p>

<p>"Why, hello!&mdash;what do you call this when it's biled,
and the skin's tuck off?" said he, recovering himself,
and giving the obstruction a thrust with his foot. "What's
this without ing'ens?" continued he, in that metaphorical
manner peculiar to men of his profession, when they ask
for naked truths and uncooked facts.</p>

<p>It was Ripton Rumsey&mdash;in that independent condition
which places men beyond the control of circumstances,
enabling them to sleep quietly either on the pavement
or on the track of a well travelled railroad, and to repose
in despite of rain, thunder, a gnawing conscience, or the
fear of a locomotive. It was Ripton Rumsey, saved from
being floated away solely by the saturated condition of
both his internal and external man.</p>

<p>"It's a man," remarked the investigator, holding to a
tree with his right hand, as he curiously, yet cautiously
pawed Ripton with his left foot. "It's a man who's
turned in outside of the door, and is taking a snooze on
the cold water principle. Well, I say, neighbour, jist in

a friendly way," added he, giving Riplon a prodigious
kick as an evidence of his amicable feeling&mdash;"if you
don't get up, you'll ketch a nagee or the collar-and-fix-you.
Up with you, Jacky Dadle."</p>

<p>Ripton's condition, as before hinted, was beyond the
ordinary impulses to human action; and he, therefore,
endured several severe digs with the foot aforesaid, without
uttering more than a deep-toned grunt; but at last
the sharp corner of the boot coming in contact with his
ribs, he suddenly turned over in the graceful attitude of a
frog, and struck out vigorously. Like Giovanni's faithful
squire, he proved himself an adept at swimming on
land. He "handled" his arms and legs with such dexterity,
that before his progress could be arrested, he was
on the curbstone. The next instant heard him plunge
into the swollen and roaring kennel, and with his head
sticking above the water, he buffeted the waves with a
heart of controversy.</p>

<p>"The boat's blowed up, and them that ain't biled are
all overboard!" spluttered the swimmer, as he dashed
the waters about, and seemed almost strangled with the
quantities which entered the hole in his head entitled a
mouth, which was sadly unacquainted with undistilled
fluids&mdash;"Strike out, or you're gone chickens! them as
can't swim must tread water, and them as can't tread
water must go to Davy Jones! Let go my leg! Every
man for himself! Phre-e-e! bro-o-o! Who's got some
splatterdocks?"</p>

<p>The watch looked on in silent admiration; but finding,
that the aquatic gentleman did not make much headway,
and that a probability existed of his going out of the
world in soundings and by water, a way evidently not in
conformity to his desires, the benevolent guardian of the
night thought proper to interpose; and bending himself

<!-- page 159 -->

to the work, at last succeeded in re-establishing Ripton
Rumsey on the curbstone.</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Ripton, after gasping a few minutes, and
wringing the water from his face and hair&mdash;"you've
saved me, and you'll be put in the newspapers for it by
way of solid reward. Jist in time&mdash;I'd been down twyst,
and if I'd gone agin, Ripton Rumsey would a stayed there&mdash;once
more and the last and the nearest gits it. Only
think&mdash;my eye! how the shads and the catties would a
chawed me up! Getting drownded ain't no fun, and
after you're drownded it's wus. My sufferings what I had
and my sufferings what I like to had is enough to make
a feller cry, only I ain't got no hankercher, and my
sleeve's so wet it won't wipe good."</p>

<p>"Yes, young 'un," said the Charley, "s'posing the
fishes had been betting on elections, they'd have invited
the other fishes to eat you for oyster suppers,&mdash;so much
majority for sturgeon-nose, or a Ripton Rumsey supper
for the company&mdash;why not? If we ketch the fishes, we eat
them; and if they ketch us, they eat us,&mdash;bite all round."</p>

<p>But the storm again began to howl, and as Ripton
evidently did not understand the rationale of the argument,
the watchman lost his poetic sympathy for the Jonah of
the gutters. Even had he heard the fishes calling for "Ripton
Rumseys fried," "Ripton Rumseys stewed," or
"Ripton Rumseys on a chafing dish," he would have felt
indifferent about the matter, and if asked how he would
take him, would undoubtedly have said, "Ripton Rumsey
on a wheelbarrow."</p>

<p>"You must go to the watch-house."</p>

<p>"What fur must I! Fetch along the Humane Society's
apparatus for the recovery of drownded indiwidooals&mdash;them's
what I want&mdash;I'm water logged. Bring us one
of the largest kind of smallers&mdash;a tumbler full of brandy

<!-- page 160 -->

and water, without no water in it. I've no notion of
being diddled out of the sweets of my interesting sitivation&mdash;I
want the goodies&mdash;wrap me in a hot blanket and
lay me by the fire&mdash;put hot bricks to my feet, fill me up
with hot toddy, and then go away. That's the scientific
touch, and it's the only way I'm to be brung to, because
when I'm drownded I'm a hard case."</p>

<p>The Charley promised all, if Ripton would accompany
him. The soft delusion was believed, and the "hard
case" was lodged in the receptacle for such as he, where,
before he discovered the deception, he fell into a profound
slumber, which lasted till morning. The examination
was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where do you live?"</p>

<p>"I'm no ways petickelar&mdash;jist where it's cheapest and
most convenient. The cheapest kind of living, according
to my notion, is when it's pretty good and don't cost
nothing. In winter, the Alms House is not slow, and
if you'll give us a call, you'll find me there when the
snow's on the ground. But when natur' smiles and the
grass is green, I'm out like a hoppergrass. The fact is,
my constitution isn't none of the strongest; hard work
hurts my system; so I go about doing little jobs for a fip
or a levy, so's to get my catnip tea and bitters regular&mdash;any
thing for a decent living, if it doesn't tire a feller.
But hang the city&mdash;rural felicity and no Charleys is the
thing, after all&mdash;pumpkins, cabbages, and apple whiskey
is always good for a weakly constitution and a man of an
elewated turn of mind."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll send you to Moyamensing prison&mdash;quite
rural."</p>

<p>The sound of that awful word struck terror to the very
marrow of Ripton. Like the rest of his class, while
bearing his soul in his stomach, he carries his heart at

<!-- page 161 -->

the end of his nose, and to his heart rushed the blood
from every part of his frame, until the beacon blazed with
a lurid glare, and the bystanders apprehended nasal apoplexy.
The rudder of his countenance grew to such a
size that there was no mistaking the leading feature of
the case. To see before him, Ripton was compelled to
squint direfully, and as the beggar in Gil Blas did his carbine,
he found himself under the necessity of resting his
tremendous proboscis on the clerk's desk, while cocking
his eye at his honour.</p>

<p>"Miamensin!" stammered Ripton&mdash;"Ouch, ouch!
now don't! that's a clever feller. Arch street was all
well enough&mdash;plenty of company and conversation to
improve a chap. But Miamensin&mdash;scandaylus! Why
they clap you right into a bag as soon as you get inside
the door, jist as if they'd bought you by the bushel, and
then, by way of finishing your education, they lug you
along and empty you into a room where you never see
nothing nor nobody. It's jist wasting a man&mdash;I'm be
bagged if I go to Miamensin!&mdash;I'd rather be in the Menagerry,
and be stirred up with a long pole twenty times
a day, so as to cause me for to growl to amuse the company.
I ain't potatoes to be put into a bag&mdash;blow the
bag!"</p>

<p>"There's no help for it, Ripton; you are a vagrant,
and must be taken care of."</p>

<p>"That's what I like; but bagging a man is no sort of
a way of taking care of him, unless he's a dead robin or
a shot tom-tit. As for being a vagrom, it's all owing to
my weakly constitution, and because I can't have my
bitters and catnip tea regular. But if it's the law, here's
at you. Being a judge, or a mayor, or any thing of that
sort's easy done without catnip tea; it don't hurt your
hands, or strain your back; but jist try a spell at smashing

<!-- page 162 -->

stones, or piling logs, and you'd learn what's what without
being put in a bag.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Ripton, as he was conducted
from the office, "every thing goes round in this world.
Perhaps I'll be stuck up some day on a bench to ladle
out law to the loafers. Who knows? Then let me
have a holt of some of the chaps that made Miamensin.
I'd ladle out the law to 'em so hot, they'd not send their
plates for more soup in a hurry. I'd have a whole bucketful
of catnip tea alongside, and the way they'd ketch
thirty days, and thirty days a top of that, would make
'em grin like chessy cats. First I'd bag all the Charleys,
and then I'd bag all the mayors, and sew 'em up."</p>

<p>A WHOLE-SOULED FELLOW;</p>

<p class="small">OR,</p>

<p class="small">THE DECLINE AND FALL OF TIPPLETON TIPPS.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>AS the reader may have observed in his journey
through life, the shades and varieties of human character
are infinite. Although the temperaments, like the cardinal
numbers, are not multitudinous, yet in the course
of events they have been so combined with each other,
and are so modified by circumstance, that ingenuity
itself cannot institute subdivisions to classify mankind
with correctness. Whatever it may have been when our
ancestors existed in the nomadic state and herded in
tribes, it is difficult now to find the temperaments in their
pristine purity; and in consequence, it is but vague description
to speak of others as sanguineous, nervous, or
saturnine. Something more definite is required to convey
to the mind a general impression of the individual,
and to give an idea of his mode of thought, his habitual
conduct, and his principles of action. Luckily, however,
for the cause of science and for the graphic force of language,
there is a universal aptitude to paint with words,
and to condense a catalogue of qualities in a phrase,
which has been carried to such perfection, that in acquiring

<!-- page 164 -->

through the medium of another a knowledge of
the distinctive moral features of our fellow mortals, it is
by no means necessary to devote hours to query and
response. An intelligent witness can convey to us the
essence of a character in a breath; a flourish of the
tongue will sketch a portrait, and place it, varnished and
framed, in our mental picture gallery. The colours will,
it is true, be coarsely dashed in, but the strength of the
resemblance abundantly compensates for deficiency of
finish. If, for instance, we are briefly told that Mr. Plinlimmon
is a "cake," the word may be derided as a cant
appellation; the ultra-fastidious may turn up their noses
at it as a slang phrase; but volumes could not render our
knowledge of the man more perfect. We have him as
it were, upon a salver, weak, unwholesome, and insipid&mdash;suited
to the fancy, perhaps, of the very youthful, but
by no means qualified for association with the bold, the
mature, and the enterprising. When we hear that a
personage is classed by competent judges among the
"spoons," we do not of course expect to find him
shining in the buffet; but we are satisfied that in action
he must figure merely as an instrument. There are
likewise, in this method of painting to the ear, the nicest
shades of difference, often represented and made intelligible
solely by the change of a letter,&mdash;"soft" being
the positive announcement of a good easy soul, and
"saft" intimating that his disposition takes rank in the
superlative degree of mollification. When danger's to
be confronted, who would rashly rely upon a "skulk?"
or, under any circumstances, ask worldly advice of those
verdant worthies known among their cotemporaries as
decidedly "green?"</p>

<p>Such words are the mystic cabala; they are the key
to individuality, throwing open a panoramic view of the

<!-- page 165 -->

man, and foreshadowing his conduct in any supposed
emergency.</p>

<p>Therefore, when we speak of Tippleton Tipps as a
"whole-souled fellow," the acute reader will find an
inkling of biography in the term&mdash;he will understand
that Tippleton is likely to be portrayed as "no one's
enemy but his own"&mdash;and from that will have a
glimpse of disastrous chances, of hairbreadth 'scapes,
and of immediate or prospective wreck. According to
the popular acceptation of the phrase, a "whole-soul" is
a boiler without a safety valve, doomed sooner or later to
explode with fury, if wisdom with her gimblet fail in
making an aperture: the puncture, however, being effected,
the soul is a whole-soul no longer. It must
therefore be confessed that Tippleton Tipps has not
thus been bored by wisdom. He has a prompt alacrity
at a "blow-out" and has been skyed in a "blow-up,"
two varieties of the blow which frequently follow each
other so closely as to be taken for cause and effect.</p>

<p>Tippleton Tipps, as his <i>soubriquet</i> imports, is one of
those who rarely become old, and are so long engaged in
sowing their wild oats as to run to seed themselves, never
fructifying in the way of experience, unless it be, like
Bardolph, in the region of the nose. Before the condensing
process was applied to language, he would probably
have been called a dissipated, unsteady rogue, who
walked in the broad path which furnishes sea-room for
eccentricities of conduct; but in these labour-saving
times, he rejoices in the milder, but quite as descriptive
title of a whole-souled fellow, the highest degree attainable
in the college of <i>insouciance</i> and jollity. It is, however,
no honorary distinction, to be gained without toil
or danger. The road is steep and thorny, and though
in striving to reach the topmost height, there is no necessity

<!-- page 166 -->

for burning the midnight oil in the retired study,
yet the midnight lamp, and many of the lamps which
beam between the noon of night and morning, are often
incidentally smashed in the process. Aspirants for other
academic glories become pale with application and protracted
vigils, but the whole-souled fellow will outwatch
the lynx, and, if his cheek be blanched, the colour is
made up in another portion of his visage. He is apt to
be as "deeply red" as anyone, though the locality of
his acquirements may be different.</p>

<p>The strict derivation of the title acquired by Tippleton&mdash;the
W. S. F. by which he is distinguished&mdash;is not
easily to be traced. There is, however, a vulgar belief
that the philosopher who devotes himself to profound
investigations, whether theoretical, like those of the
schools, or experimental, like those of the Tippses, is not
altogether free from flaw in the region of the occiput,
and hence, as the schoolman has the sutures of his cranium
caulked with latinized degrees, and as one should
always have something whole about him, fancy and
charity combined give the fast-livers credit for a "whole-soul."</p>

<p>Now, Tippleton Tipps always lived uncommonly fast.
He is in fact remarkable for free action and swift travel,
existing regularly at the rate of sixteen miles an hour
under a trot, and can go twenty in a gallop. He sleeps
fast, talks fast, eats fast, drinks fast, and, that he may get
on the faster, seldom thinks at all. It is an axiom of his
that thinking, if not "an idle waste of thought," is a
very leaden business&mdash;one must stop to think, which
wastes time and checks enterprise. He reprobates it as
much as he does poring over books, an employment
which he regards as only calculated to give a man a
"crick in the neck," and to spoil the originality of his

<!-- page 167 -->

ideas. A whole-souled fellow knows every thing intuitively&mdash;what
is reason with others, is instinct in him.</p>

<p>When Tippleton was quite a little boy, his moral idiosyncrasy
manifested itself in a very decisive way. His
generosity was remarkable; he was never known to pause
in giving away the playthings belonging to his brothers
and sisters; and his disinterestedness was such that he
never hesitated an instant in breaking or losing his own,
if sure of repairing the deficit by foraging upon others.
No sordid impulse prevented a lavish expenditure of his
pennies, and as soon as they were gone he "financiered"
with the same liberality by borrowing from his little
friends, never offending their delicacy by an offer to
return the loan,&mdash;a blunder into which meaner spirits
sometimes fall. When that statesmanlike expedient
would no longer answer, he tried the great commercial
system upon a small scale, by hypothecating with the
apple and pie woman the pennies he was to receive, thus
stealing a march upon time by living in advance. There
being many apple women and likewise many pie women,
he extended his business in this whole-souled sort
of a way, and skilfully avoiding the sinking of more
pennies than actually necessary to sustain his credit, he
prospered for some time in the eating line. But as every
thing good is sure to have an end, the apple and pie system
being at last blown out tolerably large, Tippleton
exploded with no assets. By way of a moral lesson, his
father boxed his ears and refused to settle with his creditors,&mdash;whereupon
Tippleton concluded that the sin lay altogether
in being found out,&mdash;while his mother kissed
him, gave him a half dollar, and protested that he had the
spirit of a prince and ought not to be snubbed. As the
spirit of a prince is a fine thing, it was cherished accordingly,
and Tippleton spent his cash and laughed at the
pie women.</p>

<!-- page 168 -->

<p>The home department of his training being thus
carefully attended to, Tippleton went to a variety of
"lyceums," "academies," and "institutes," and mosaicked
his education by remaining long enough to learn the
branches of mischief indigenous to each, when, either
because he had outstripped his teacher, or because his
whole-soul had become too large, he was invariably
requested to resign, receiving on all of these interesting
occasions the cuff paternal and the kiss maternal, the
latter being accompanied, as usual, with a reinforcement
to his purse and a plaudit to his spirit. Tippleton then
took a turn at college, where he received the last polish
before the premature notice to quit was served upon him;
and at seventeen he was truly "whole-souled," playing
billiards as well as any "pony" in the land, and boxing
as scientifically as the "deaf 'un." He could owe everybody
with a grace peculiar to himself; kick up the
noisiest of all possible rows at the theatre, invariably
timed with such judgment as to make a tumultuous rush
at the most interesting part of the play; he could extemporize
a <i>fracas</i> at a ball, and could put Cayenne pepper
in a church stove. The most accomplished young man
about town was Tippleton Tipps, and every year increased
his acquirements.</p>

<p>Time rolled on; the elder Tippses left the world
for their offspring to bustle in, and Tippleton, reaching
his majority, called by a stretch of courtesy the age of
discretion, received a few thousands as his outfit in
manhood. He, therefore, resolved to set up for himself,
determined to be a whole-souled fellow all the time,
instead of, as before, acting in that capacity after business
hours.</p>

<p>"Now," said Tipps, exultingly, "I'll see what fun
is made of&mdash;now I'll enjoy life&mdash;now I'll be a man!"</p>

<!-- page 169 -->

<p>And, acting on that common impression, which, however,
is not often borne out by the result, that when the
present means are exhausted something miraculous will
happen to recruit the finances, Tippleton commenced
operations,&mdash;stylish lodgings, a "high trotting horse,"
buggy, and all other "confederate circumstance." It was
soon known that he was under weigh, and plenty of
friends forthwith clustered around him, volunteering their
advice, and lending their aid to enable him to support the
character of a whole-souled fellow in the best and latest
manner. Wherever his knowledge happened to be deficient,
Diggs "put him up" to this, Twiggs "put him up"
to that, and Sniggs "put him up" to t'other, and Diggs,
Twiggs, and Sniggs gave him the preference whenever
they wanted a collateral security or a direct loan. Thus,
Tippleton not only had the pleasure of their company at
frolics given by himself, but had likewise the advantage
of being invited by them to entertainments for which his
own money paid.</p>

<p>"Clever is hardly a name for you, Tippleton," said
Diggs, using the word in its cis-atlantic sense.</p>

<p>"No back-out in him," mumbled Sniggs, with unwonted
animation.</p>

<p>"The whole-souled'st fellow I ever saw," chimed
Twiggs.</p>

<p>Tippleton had just furnished his satellites with the
cash to accompany him to the races; for then he was yet
rather "flush."</p>

<p>"Give me Tippleton anyhow," said Diggs,&mdash;"he's
all sperrit."</p>

<p>"And <i>no</i> mistake," chimed Sniggs.</p>

<p>"He wanted it himself, I know he did," ejaculated
Twiggs, "but, whole-souled fellow&mdash;" and Twiggs buttoned
his pocket on the needful, and squinted through

<!-- page 170 -->

the shutters at the tailor's boy and the bootmaker's boy,
who walked suspiciously away from the door, as if they
didn't believe that</p>

<div class="center">

<p>TIPPLETON TIPPS, ESQ.</p>

<p><i>Dr.</i></p>

<p><i>To sundries as per account rendered,</i></p>

</div>

<p>was "not in." Tailors' boys, and shoemakers' boys,
and indeed, bill-bearing boys in general, are matter-of-factish
incredulous creatures at best, and have no respect
for the poetic licenses; they are not aware that whole-souled
people, like the mysterious ball of those ingenious
artists the "thimble riggers," who figure upon the sward
on parade days, race days, hanging days, and other
popular jubilees, are either in or out as the emergencies
of the case require.</p>

<p>But what would not Tippleton do to maintain his
reputation? While he had the means, let borrowers be as
plenty as blackberries, they had only to pronounce the
"open sesame" to have their wishes gratified, even if
Tippleton himself were obliged to borrow to effect so
desirable an object. The black looks of landlords and
landladies, the pertinacities of mere business creditors,
what are they, when the name of a whole-souled fellow
is at stake? Would they have such a one sink into the
meanness of giving the preference to engagements which
bring no credit except upon books? Is selfishness so
predominant in their natures? If so, they need not look
to be honoured by the Tippleton Tippses with the light
of their countenance, or the sunshine of their patronage.
There is not a Tipps in the country who would lavish
interviews upon men or the representatives of men, who
have so little sympathy with the owners of whole-souls.
To such, the answer will invariably be "not in."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<!-- page 171 -->

<p>"Tippleton Tipps, I've an idea," said Diggs.</p>

<p>"Surprising," said Tippleton moodily.</p>

<p>"A splendid idea&mdash;a fortune-making idea for you,"
continued Diggs.</p>

<p>Now, it so happened that Tippleton was just in that
situation in which the prospect of a fortune is a "splendid
idea," even to a "whole-souled fellow." His funds were
exhausted&mdash;his credit pumped dry; the horse and buggy
had been sequestered, and "something miraculous" in the
shape of relief had not happened. In fact, affairs were in
that desperate condition which offers no resource but the
dreadful one of suicide, or that still more dreadful alternative,
going to work,&mdash;running away without the means
being a matter of impossibility.</p>

<p>"As how?" interrogated Tippleton dubiously, he
having but little faith in the money-making schemes
broached by Diggs, that individual's talent lying quite in
another direction.</p>

<p>"As how?" chorussed Sniggs and Twiggs, who, as
hard run as their compatriots, snuffed free quarters in the
word, and a well-filled purse ready at their call.</p>

<p>"You must marry," added Diggs. "Get thee a wife,
Tippleton."</p>

<p>"Ah! that would improve the matter amazingly, and
be quite a profitable speculation," replied Tippleton
ironically.</p>

<p>"To be sure&mdash;why not? What's to prevent a good
looking, whole-souled fellow like you from making a
spec?&mdash;Grimson's daughter, for instance&mdash;not pretty,
but plaguey rich&mdash;only child&mdash;what's to hinder&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;what's to hinder?" said Twiggs and Sniggs,
looking at each other, and then at Tippleton&mdash;"whole-souled&mdash;good
looking&mdash;and all that&mdash;just what the girls
like."</p>

<!-- page 172 -->

<p>"Perhaps they do, but papas do not," said Tippleton,
with a meditating look; "as for old Grimson, he
hates 'em."</p>

<p>"Very like; but you don't want to marry Grimson&mdash;get
the daughter, and the father follows&mdash;that's the plan.
If it must be so, why make an impression upon Miss
Jemima first&mdash;then shave off your whiskers, uncurl your
hair, put your hat straight on your head, and swear to a
reform&mdash;quit fun, go to bed early&mdash;very hard certainly,
but when matters are once properly secured, then you
know&mdash;ha! ha!" and Twiggs sportively knocked Tippleton
in the ribs.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed Twiggs and Sniggs, poking each
other in the same anatomical region.</p>

<p>Although Tippleton had but little fancy for matrimony
in general, or for Miss Jemima Grimson in particular,
yet under the circumstances, he felt disposed to venture
on the experiment and to try what could be done. He
therefore continued the conversation, which happened
late one night in a leading thoroughfare, and which was
interrupted in a strange, startling manner.</p>

<p>An intelligent "hem!" given in that peculiar tone
which intimates that the utterer has made a satisfactory
discovery, seemed to issue from a neighbouring tree-box,
and as Messrs. Tipps, Diggs, Sniggs, and Twiggs directed
their astonished regards toward the suspected point, a
head decorated with a straw hat&mdash;a very unseasonable
article at the time, and more unseasonable from its lid-like
top, which opened and shut at each passing breeze&mdash;protruded
from the shelter.</p>

<p>"Ahem!" repeated the head, seeming to speak with
"most miraculous organ," the wintry blast lifting up
the hat-crown and letting it fall again, as if it were the
mouth of some nondescript&mdash;"Ahem! I like the speckilation

<!-- page 173 -->

myself, and I must either be tuck in as a pardener
or I'll peach. I knows old Grimsings&mdash;he lent me a kick
and a levy t'other day, and if I don't see good reason to
the contrayry, I mean to stick up fur him. It's a prime
speckilation fur me every-vich-vay."</p>

<p>The conspirators were astonished, as well they might
be, at the sudden and unexpected apparition among them
of another "whole-souled fellow" with a dilapidated hat.
The stranger was Richard Dout, the undegenerated scion
of a noble house, the members of which have been conspicuous
in all ages&mdash;it was Richard, known to his
familiars by the less respectful, but certainly more affectionate
appellation of "Dicky Dout." He is a man of
fine feelings and very susceptible susceptibilities, being
of that peculiar temperament which is generally understood
to constitute genius, and possessing that delicate
organization which is apt to run the head of its owner
against stone walls, and prompts him on all occasions to
put his fingers in the fire. He has, therefore, like his
illustrious progenitors, a strong affinity for "looped and
windowed raggedness," and rather a tendency toward a
physical method of spiritualizing the grosser particles of
the frame. But for once, Dout was sharpened for
"speckilation."</p>

<p>"I'm to go sheers," added Dout, as if it were a settled
thing.</p>

<p>"Sheer off, you impudent rascal!" ejaculated the
party.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind sass," replied he, seating himself
coolly on the fire-plug, and deliberately tucking up the
only tail which remained to his coat&mdash;"Cuss as much as
you please&mdash;it won't skeer wot I know out o' me. Don't
hurt yourself, said Carlo to the kitten. I'll see Grimsings
in the morning, if I ain't agreeable here&mdash;I'm to

<!-- page 174 -->

have fust every and a shot this time, as the boys says ven
they're playin' of marvels. Let them knuckle down
close as can't help it," concluded Dout, as he whistled
and rubbed his shin, and remarked that when "sot upon
a thing he was raal lignum witey."</p>

<p>"Tippleton!" said Diggs.</p>

<p>"Well?" replied Tippleton.</p>

<p>"A fix!"</p>

<p>"Ra-a-ther."</p>

<p>"<i>Nullum go-um</i>," added Sniggs, who prided himself
upon his classical knowledge.</p>

<p>"<i>E pluribum uniber</i>, if you come to that," interjected
Dout.</p>

<p>"We're caught," added Twiggs, who dealt largely in
French; "we're caught, <i>tootin in the assembly</i>."</p>

<p>"Does he know us?" inquired Tippleton.</p>

<p>"To be sure," replied Dout&mdash;"we whole-souled
fellers knows everybody in the same line of business."</p>

<p>This was decidedly a check&mdash;the speculators were
outgeneralled by the genius of the Douts; so making
a virtue of necessity, they mollified him by a slight
douceur scraped up at the time, and large promises for
the future. Dicky was forthwith installed as boot-cleaner
and coat-brusher to the party, as well as recipient of
old clothes, under condition of keeping tolerably sober
and very discreet.</p>

<p>Peace being thus concluded, Tippleton Tipps commenced
the campaign against the heart of Miss Jemima
Grimson, who liked whole-souled fellows, and began the
work of ingratiating himself with his father's old friend
Mr. Grimson, who cordially disliked whole-souled fellows.
In the first place, therefore, he ceased to associate publicly
with Diggs, Sniggs, and Twiggs, and contented himself

<!-- page 175 -->

with chuckling with them in private. He silenced
his creditors by demonstrating to them that he was a
young man of great expectations, and even contrived to
obtain advances upon the prospect, wherewith to keep
himself in trim and to nourish Dicky Dout. Miss Jemima
was delighted, for Tippleton had such a way with
him; while Mr. Grimson's unfavourable impressions
gradually vanished before his professions of reform and
improved conduct. The old gentleman employed him
as a clerk, and had a strong inclination either to "set him
up" or to "take him in." "Such a correct, sensible
young man has he become," quoth Grimson.</p>

<p>Things were thus beautifully <i>en train</i>, when Mr.
Grimson rashly sent his <i>proteg&eacute;</i> with a sum of money
to be used in a specified way in a neighbouring city, and
the <i>proteg&eacute;</i>, who longed to indulge himself in that which
he classically termed a "knock-around," took his allies
Diggs, Sniggs, and Twiggs with him. The "cash proper"
being expended&mdash;the wine being in and the wit being
out&mdash;Tippleton being a whole-souled fellow, and his
companions knowing it, the "cash improper" was diverted
from its legitimate channel, and after a few days of roaring
mirth, they returned rather dejected and disheartened.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>"Come, what's the use of sighing?" roared Tippleton,
as they sat dolorously in a snug corner at the headquarters
of the whole-souled fellows. "The money's
not quite out&mdash;Champagne!"</p>

<p>"Bravo, Tippleton!" responded his companions, and
the corks flew merrily&mdash;"That's the only way to see
one's road out of trouble."</p>

<p>"Another bottle, Dout!&mdash;that for Grimson!" shouted
Tipps, snapping his fingers&mdash;"I'll run off with his
daughter&mdash;what do you say to that, Dicky Dout?"</p>

<!-- page 176 -->

<p>Dicky dodged the cork which was flirted at him, and
regarding the company with a higubrious air, observed:</p>

<p>"Accordin' to me, gettin' corned's no way&mdash;there's
only two business sitiations in which it's allowable&mdash;one's
when you're so skeered you can't tell what to do,
and the other's when your eyes is sot and it's no use
doin' nothin'&mdash;when you're goin', and when you're
gone&mdash;it makes you go by a sort of a slant, instead of a
bumping tumble. It eases a feller down like a tayckle,
when on temperance principles he'd break his neck.
For my part, I think this bustin' of yourn looks bad"&mdash;Dicky
filled a glass and drained its contents&mdash;" 'specially
when you're goin' it on crab-apple cider."</p>

<p>"Get out, Dicky Dout!&mdash;Fetch some cigars, Dicky
Dout!"</p>

<p>The party sang songs, the party made speeches, and
the party rapidly drank up the remainder of Mr. Grimson's
cash, a catastrophe which in their present state of
mind did not trouble them at all, except when they remembered
that no more money, no more wine. Boniface
was used to dealing with whole-souled fellows.</p>

<p>"Order, gentlemen!" said Tipps, rising to deliver an
address&mdash;"I don't get upon my feet to impugn the eye-sight,
gentlemen, or the ear-sight, gentlemen, of any
member present; but merely to state that there are facts&mdash;primary
facts, like a kite, and contingent facts, like
bob-tails&mdash;one set of facts that hang on to another set of
facts"&mdash;and Tippleton grasped the table to support himself.
"The first of these facts is, that in looking out at
the window I see snow&mdash;I likewise hear sleigh-bells, from
which we have the bob-tailed contingent that we ought
to go a sleighing to encourage domestic manufactures."</p>

<p>"Hurra!" said Diggs and Sniggs&mdash;"let's go a
sleighing!"</p>

<!-- page 177 -->

<p>"Hurray!" muttered Twiggs, who sat drowsing over
an extinguished cigar and an empty glass&mdash;"let's go a
Maying!"</p>

<p>"I have stated, gentlemen," continued Tipps, swaying
to and fro, and endeavouring to squeeze a drop from
a dry bottle&mdash;"several facts, but there is another&mdash;a
further contingent&mdash;the sleighing may be good, and we
ought to go&mdash;but, gentlemen, we've got no money!
That's what I call an appalling fact, in great staring capitals&mdash;the
money's gone, the Champagne's gone, but
though we made 'em go, we can't go ourselves!"</p>

<p>Tippleton Tipps sank into his chair, and added, as he
sucked at his cigar with closed eyes:</p>

<p>"Capitalists desiring to contract will please send in
their terms, sealed and endorsed 'Proposals to loan.' "</p>

<p>"Cloaks, watches, and breast-pins&mdash;spout 'em," hinted
Dout from a corner. "We whole-souled people always
plant sich articles in sleighing-time, and let's 'em crop
out in the spring."</p>

<p>The hint was taken. As the moon rose, a sleigh whizzed
rapidly along the street, and as it passed, Tippleton
Tipps was seen bestriding it like a Colossus, whirling
his arms as if they were the fans of a windmill, and
screaming " 'Tis my delight of a shiny night!" in which
his associates, including Dout, who was seated by the
driver, joined with all their vocal power.</p>

<p>" 'Twas merry in the parlor, 'twas merry in the hall,"
when Tippleton, <i>cum suis</i>, alighted at a village inn.
Fiddles were playing and people were dancing all over
the house, and the new arrivals did not lose time in
adding to the jovial throng. Tippleton, seizing the bar-maid's
cap, placed it on his own head, and using the
shovel and tongs for the apparatus of a fiddler, danced
and played on top of the table, while Dout beat the door

<!-- page 178 -->

by way of a drum, and Diggs, Sniggs, and Twiggs disturbed
the "straight fours" of the company in the general
assembly-room by a specimen of the Winnebago war-dance,
the whole being accompanied by whoopings after
the manner of the aborigines.</p>

<p>The clamor drew the "select parties" into the passages
to see the latest arrivals from Pandemonium.</p>

<p>"Who cares for Grimson?" said Tipps, as he fiddled
and sung the following choice morceau from Quizembob's
Reliques of Lyric Poetry&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"<i>Oh! my father-in-law to me was cross;<br/>

Oh 'twas neither for the better, nor yet for the worse;<br/>

He neither would give me a cow nor a horse,</i>"&mdash;</p>

<p>when Mr. Grimson and Miss Jemima Grimson from the
"select parties" stood before him.</p>

<p>"So, Mr. Tippleton Tipps, this is your reform!
be pleased to follow me, and give an account of the
business intrusted to your charge," said Mr. Grimson
sternly.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed Tippleton, fiddling up to him&mdash;"business&mdash;pooh!
Dance, my old buck, dance like a
whole-souled fellow&mdash;like me&mdash;dance, Jemimy, it may
make you pretty&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"<i>He neither would give me a cow nor a horse.</i>"</p>

<p>Mr. Grimson turned indignantly on his heel, and Miss
Jemima Grimson, frowning volumes of disdain at seeing
her lover thus attired and thus disporting himself, and
at hearing him thus contumelious to her personal charms,
gave him what is poetically termed "a look," and sailed
majestically out of the room leaning on her father's arm.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" said Tippleton, continuing to fiddle.</p>

<p>"The speckilation's got the grippe," added Dout.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<!-- page 179 -->

<p>It was nearly morning when a pair of horses, with
the fragments of a sleigh knocking about their heels,
dashed wildly into Millet's stable yard. They were the
ponies which had drawn Tippleton Tipps and his cohort;
but where were those worthy individuals? At the
corner of a street, where the snow and water had formed
a delusive compound as unstable as the Goodwin sands,
lay Tippleton half "smothered in cream"&mdash;ice cream,
while "his lovely companions" were strewed along the
wayside at various intervals, according to the tenacity of
their grasp.</p>

<p>"The tea party's spilt," said Dicky Dout, as he went
feeling among the snow with a fragment of the wreck,
and at length forked up Tippleton, as if he were a dumpling
in a bowl of soup.</p>

<p>The tableau was striking. The tender-hearted Dout
sat upon the curbstone with Tippleton's head upon his
knee, trying to rub a little life into him. It was a second
edition of Marmion and Clara de Clare at Flodden field,
the Lord of Fontenaye and Tippleton Tipps both being
at the climax of their respective catastrophes.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Dout, heaving a deep sigh as he rubbed
away at his patient's forehead, as if it were a boot to
clean, "this night has been the ruination of us all&mdash;we're
smashed up small and sifted through. Here lies
Mr. Tipps in a predicary&mdash;and me and the whole on 'em
is little better nor a flock of gone goslings. It's man's
natur', I believe, and we can't help it no how. As fur me,
I wish I was a pig&mdash;there's some sense in being a pig
wot's fat; pigs don't have to speckilate and bust&mdash;pigs
never go a sleighing, quarrel with their daddies-in-law
wot was to be, get into sprees, and make tarnal fools of
themselves. Pigs is decent behaved people and good
citizens, though they ain't got no wote. And then they

<!-- page 180 -->

haven't got no clothes to put on of cold mornings when
they get up; they don't have to be darnin' and patchin'
their old pants; they don't wear no old hats on their
heads, nor have to ask people for 'em&mdash;cold wittles is
plenty for pigs. My eyes! if I was a jolly fat pig
belonging to respectable people, it would be tantamount
to nothin' with me who was president. Who ever see'd
one pig a settin' on a cold curbstone a rubbin' another
pig's head wot got chucked out of a sleigh? Pigs
has too much sense to go a ridin' if so be as they can
help it. I wish I was one, and out of this scrape.
It's true," continued Dout thoughtfully, and pulling
Tippleton's nose till it cracked at the bridge-joint,&mdash;"it's
true that pigs has their troubles like humans&mdash;constables
ketches 'em, dogs bites 'em, and pigs is sometimes almost
as done-over suckers as men; but pigs never runs their
own noses into scrapes, coaxin' themselves to believe it's
fun, as we do. I never see a pig go the whole hog in
my life, 'sept upon rum cherries. I'm thinkin' Mr.
Tipps is defunct; he sleeps as sound as if it was time to
get up to breakfast."</p>

<p>But Tipps slowly revived; he rolled his glassy eye
wildly, the other being, as it were, "put up for exportation,"
or "bunged" as they have it in the vernacular.</p>

<p>"Mister Tipps," said Dout, "do you know what's
the matter?"</p>

<p>"Fun's the matter, isn't it?" gasped Tipps; "I've
been a sleighing, and we always do it so&mdash;it's fun this
way&mdash;but what's become of my other eye?&mdash;Where's&mdash;stop&mdash;I
remember. The horses and sleigh were in a
hurry, and couldn't stay&mdash;compliments to the folks, but
can't sit down."</p>

<p>"Your t'other eye," replied Dout, "as fur as I can
see, is kivered up to keep; the wire-edge is took considerable

<!-- page 181 -->

off your nose&mdash;your coat is split as if somebody
wanted to make a pen of it, and your trousers is fractured."</p>

<p>"Well, I thought the curbstone was uncommonly cold.
What with being pitched out of the sleigh, and the grand
combat at the hotel, we've had the whole-souled'st time&mdash;knocked
almost into a cocked hat. But if you don't
get thrashed, you haven't been a sleighing. What can
science do in a room against chairs, pokers, shovels, and
tongs? Swing it into 'em as pretty as you please, it's
ten to one if you're not quaited down stairs like clothes
to wash. Fun alive!&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Tippleton Tipps yelled defiance, and attempted
to show how fields were won&mdash;or lost, as in his case;
but nature is a strict banker, and will not honour your
drafts when no funds are standing to your credit.</p>

<p>"Ah!" panted he, as he fell back into the arms of
Mr. Dout; "my frolic's over for once&mdash;broke off with
Grimson, spent his money&mdash;sleigh all in flinders, and I'll
have to get a doctor to hunt for my eye and put my nose
in splints. Ha! ha! there <i>is</i> no mistake in me&mdash;always
come home from enjoying myself, sprawling on a shutter,
as a gentleman should&mdash;give me something to talk
about&mdash;who's afraid?"</p>

<p>Even Dout was surprised to hear such valiant words
from the drenched and pummelled mass before him; and
as he stared, Tippleton mutteringly asked to be taken
home.</p>

<p>"I'm a whole-souled fellow," whispered he faintly&mdash;"whole-souled&mdash;and&mdash;no&mdash;mistake&mdash;about&mdash;the&mdash;matter&mdash;at&mdash;all."</p>

<p>Assistance and "a shutter" being procured, Tippleton
Tipps was conveyed to his lodgings, where with a black
patch across his nose, a green shade over one eye, the
other being coloured purple, blue, and yellow halfway to

<!-- page 182 -->

the jaw, his upper lip in the condition of that of the man
"wot won the fight," his left arm in a sling, and his
right ankle sprained, sat Tippleton for at least a month,
the very impersonation, essence, and aroma of a "whole-souled
 fellow." As soon, however, as he was in marching
order, he suddenly disappeared, or perhaps was exhaled,
like Romulus and other great men, boldly walking right
through his difficulties, and leaving them behind him in
a state of orphanage.</p>

<p>The last heard of Dout was his closing speech after
taking Tipps home on the night of the catastrophe.</p>

<p>"My speckilation has busted its biler. To my notion
this 'ere is a hard case. If I tries to mosey along through
the world without saying nothin' to nobody, it won't do&mdash;livin'
won't come of itself, like the man you owe
money to&mdash;you are obligated to step and fetch it. If I
come fur to go fur to paddle my tub quietly down the
gutter of life without bumping agin the curbstone on one
side, I'm sure to get aground on the other, or to be upsot
somehow. If I tries little speckilations sich as boning
things, I'm sartin to be cotch; and if I goes pardeners,
as I did with Mr. Tipps, it won't do. Fips and levies
ain't as plenty as snowballs in this 'ere yearthly spear.
But talking of snowballs, I wish I was a nigger. Nobody
will buy a white man, but a stout nigger is worth the
slack of two or three hundred dollars. I hardly believe
myself there is so much money; but they say so, and
if I could get a pot of blackin' and some brushes, I'd
give myself a coat, and go and hang myself up for sale
in the Jarsey Market, like a froze possum."</p>

<p>Dout walked gloomily away, and the story goes that
when this whole-souled fellow in humble life was finally
arrested as a vagrant, his last aspiration as he entered the
prison, was: "Oh! I wish I was a pig, 'cause they
ain't got to go to jail!"</p>

<p>GAMALIEL GAMBRIL;</p>

<p class="small">OR, DOMESTIC UNEASINESS.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>IT may be a truism, yet we cannot help recording it as
our deliberate opinion, that life is begirt with troubles.
The longer we live, the more we are convinced of the
fact&mdash;solidly, sincerely convinced; especially in cold
weather, when all evils are doubled, and great annoyances
are reinforced by legions of petty vexations. The
happiest conditions of existence&mdash;among which it is
usual to class matrimony&mdash;are not without their alloy.
There is a principle of equity always at work, and, therefore,
where roses strew the path, thorns are sharpest
and most abundant. Were it otherwise, frail humanity
might at times forget its mortal nature&mdash;as it is apt to do
when not roughly reminded of the fact&mdash;and grow altogether
too extensive for its nether integuments.</p>

<p>A stronger proof that "there's naught but care on
every hand," and that it is often nearest when least expected,
could not be found, than in the case of Gamaliel
Gambril the cobbler, an influential and well known resident
of Ringbone Alley, a section of the city wherein he
has "a voice potential, double as the Duke's." Gamaliel's
Christmas gambols&mdash;innocent as he deemed
them&mdash;terminated in the revolt of his household,
a species of civil war which was the more distressing
to him as it came like a cloud after sunshine,

<!-- page 184 -->

darker and more gloomy from the preceding light. It is
often thus with frail humanity. The keenest vision cannot
penetrate the contracted circle of the present, and give
certain information of the future. Who, that sets forth
to run a rig, can tell in what that rig may end? The
laughing child, unconscious of mishap, pursues the sportive
butterfly and falls into a ditch; and man, proud of
his whiskers, his experience, and his foresight, will yet
follow that phantom felicity until he gets into a scrape.
The highways and the byways of existence are filled
with man-traps and spring-guns, and happy he whose
activity is so great that he can dance among them with
uninjured ankles, and escape scot-free. That faculty,
which to a man of a sportive turn of mind is more precious
than rubies, is denied to Gamaliel Gambril. When
convivially inclined, he is a Napoleon, whose every battle-field
is a Waterloo&mdash;a Santa Anna, whose San Jacintos
are innumerable.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>It was past the noon of night, and the greater part of
those who had beds to go to, had retired to rest. Light
after light had ceased to flash from the windows, and
every house was in darkness, save where a faintly burning
candle in the attic told that Sambo or Dinah had just
finished labour, and was about enjoying the sweets of
repose, or where a fitful flashing through the fan light of
an entry door hinted at the fact that young Hopeful was
still abroad at his revels. It seemed that the whole city
and liberties were in bed, and the active imagination of
the solitary stroller through the streets could not avoid
painting the scene. He figured to himself the two hundred
thousand human creatures who dwell within those
precincts, lying prone upon their couches&mdash;couches varied
as their fortunes, and in attitudes more varied than either&mdash;some,

<!-- page 185 -->

who are careless of making a figure in the world,
with their knees drawn up to their chins; the haughty
and ostentatious stretched out to their full extent; the ambitious,
the sleeping would-be C&aelig;sars, spread abroad like
the eagle on a sign, or a chicken split for the gridiron,
each hand and each foot reaching toward a different point
of the compass; the timid rolled up into little balls, with
their noses just peeping from under the clothes; and the
valiant with clenched fists and bosoms bare&mdash;for character
manifests itself by outward signs, both in our sleeping
and in our waking moments; and if the imagination of the
speculative watcher has ears as well as eyes, the varied
music which proceeds from these two hundred thousand
somnolent bodies will vibrate upon his tympanum&mdash;the
dulcet flute-like snoring which melodiously exhales from
the Phidian nose of the sleeping beauty; the querulous
whining of the nervous papa; the warlike startling snort
of mature manhood, ringing like a trumpet call, and rattling
the window glass with vigorous fury; the whistling,
squeaking, and grunting of the eccentric; and, in fine, all
the diversified sounds with which our race choose to accompany
their sacrifices to Morpheus.</p>

<p>But though so many were in bed, there were some
who should have been in bed who were not there. On
this very identical occasion, when calmness seemed to
rule the hour, the usually quiet precincts of Ringbone
Alley were suddenly disturbed by a tremendous clatter.
But loud as it was, the noise for a time continued unheeded.
The inhabitants of that locality&mdash;who are excellent
and prudent citizens, and always, while they give
their arms and legs a holiday, impose additional labour
upon their digestive organs&mdash;worn out by the festivities
of the season, and somewhat oppressed with a feverish
head-ache, the consequence thereof, were generally

<!-- page 186 -->

asleep; and, with no disposition to flatter, or to assume
more for them than they are entitled to, it must be conceded
that the Ringboners, when they tie up their heads
and take off their coats to it, are capital sleepers&mdash;none
better. They own no relationship to those lazy, aristocratic
dozers, who seem to despise the wholesome employment
of slumbering, and, instead of devoting their
energies to the task, amuse themselves with counting the
clock, and with idly listening to every cry of fire&mdash;who
are afraid to trust themselves unreservedly to the night,
and are so suspicious of its dusky face, and so doubtful
of the fidelity of the "sentinel stars," as to watch both
night and stars. Unlike this nervous race, the Ringboners
have in general nothing to tell when they assemble
round the breakfast table. They eat heartily, and
grumble not about the badness of their rest; for their
rest has no bad to it. They neither hear the shutters slam
in the night, nor are they disturbed by mysterious knockings
about three in the morning. They do not, to make
others ashamed of their honest torpidity, ask, "Where
was the fire?" and look astonished that no one heard
the alarm. On the contrary, when they couch themselves,
they are only wide enough awake to see the
candle out of the corner of one eye, and nothing is audible
to them between the puff which extinguishes the
light and the call to labour at the dawn. When their
heads touch the pillow, their optics are closed and their
mouths are opened. Each proboscis sounds the charge
into the land of Nod, and like Eastern monarchs, they
slumber to slow music, Ringbone Alley being vocal with
one tremendous snore.</p>

<p>No wonder that such a praiseworthy people, so circumstanced,
should not be easily awakened by the noise
before alluded to. But the disturbance grew louder; the

<!-- page 187 -->

little dogs frisked and barked; the big dogs yawned and
bayed; the monopolizing cats, who like nobody's noise
but their own, whisked their tails and flew through the
cellar windows in dismay. The alley, which, like
Othello, can stand most things unmoved, was at last
waking up, and not a few night-capped heads projected
like whitewashed artillery through the embrasures of
the upper casements, dolefully and yawnfully "vanting
to know vot vos the row?"</p>

<p>The opening of Gamaliel Gambril's front door answered
the question. He and his good lady were earnestly
discussing some problem of domestic economy&mdash;some
knotty point as to the reserved rights of parties to
the matrimonial compact. It soon, however, became
evident that the husband's reasoning, if not perfectly convincing,
was too formidable and weighty to be resisted.
Swift as the flash, Madam Gambril dashed out of the
door, while Gamaliel, like "panting time, toiled after her
in vain," flourishing a strap in one hand and a broom in
the other. Though the night was foggy, it was clear
that something unusual was the matter with Gamaliel.
His intellectual superstructure had, by certain unknown
means, become too heavy for his physical framework.
Mind was triumphing over matter, and, as was to be expected,
matter proving weak, the immortal mind had
many tumbles; but still, rolling, tumbling, and stumbling,
Gamaliel, like Alpheus, pursued his Arethusa; not
until the flying fair was metamorphosed into a magic
stream, but until he pitched into an urban water-course
of a less poetic nature, which checked his race, while its
waves soothed and measurably tranquillized his nervous
system. At the catastrophe, Mrs. Gambril ceased her
flight, but after the manner of the Cossacks of the Don,

<!-- page 188 -->

or the Mahratta cavalry, kept circling round the enemy&mdash;out
of striking distance, yet within hail.</p>

<p>"Gammy Gambril," said she, appealing to the <i>argumentum
ad hominem</i>, in reply to that <i>ad baculum</i> from
which she fled&mdash;"Gammy, you're a mere warmunt&mdash;a
pitiful warmunt; leave me no money&mdash;not at home these
two days and nights, and still no money!&mdash;now you are
come, what do you fetch?&mdash;a tipsy cobbler! Hot corn is
good for something, and so is corned beef; but I'd like
to know what's the use of a corned cobbler?"</p>

<p>"Corneycopey for ever! It's merry Christmas and
happy New Year, old woman!" said Gambril, raising
himself with great difficulty to a sitting posture; "and
I'll larrup you like ten thousand, if you'll only come a
little nearer. Ask for money on a Christmas!&mdash;it's too
aggrawatin'!&mdash;it's past endurin'! I'm bin jolly myself&mdash;I'm
jolly now, and if you ain't jolly, come a little nearer
and [<i>flourishing the strap</i>] I'll make you jolly."</p>

<p>Much conversation of a similar tenor passed between
the parties; but as the argument continued the same, no
new ideas were elicited, until Montezuma Dawkins, a
near neighbour, and a man of a rather nervous temperament&mdash;the
consequence perhaps of being a bachelor&mdash;stepped
out to put an end to the noise, which interfered
materially with his repose.</p>

<p>"Go home, Mrs. Gambril," said Montezuma Dawkins
soothingly; and as she obeyed, he turned to Mr.
Gambril, and remarked in a severe tone, "This 'ere's
too bad. Gammy&mdash;right isn't often done in the world;
but if you had your rights, you'd be between the finger
and thumb of justice&mdash;just like a pinch of snuff&mdash;you'd
be took."</p>

<p>Montezuma Dawkins prided himself on his legal

<!-- page 189 -->

knowledge, for he had made the fires in a magistrate's
office during a whole winter, and consequently was well
qualified to lecture his neighbours upon their errors in
practice.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," replied Gammy&mdash;"me took when it's
Christmas!&mdash;well I never!&mdash;did any body ever?&mdash;I'm
be switch'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No swearing. This 'ere is a connubibal case&mdash;connubibalities
in the street; and the law is as straight as a
loon's leg on that pint. You don't understand the law,
I s'pose? Well, after you're growed up, and your real
poppy&mdash;or your pa, as the people in Chestnut street
would call him&mdash;can't keep you straight, because you
can lick him, which is what they mean by being of age,
then the law becomes your poppy, because it isn't so
easy to lick the law. The law, then, allows you a wife;
but the law allows it in moderation, like any thing else.
Walloping her is one of the little fondlings of the connubibal
state; but if it isn't done within doors, and without
a noise, like taking a drop too much, why then it
ain't moderation, and the law steps in to stop intemperate
amusements. Why don't you buy a digestion of
the laws, so as to know what's right and what's wrong?
It's all sot down."</p>

<p>"The law's a fool, and this isn't the first time I've
thought so by a long shot. If it wasn't for the law,
and for being married, a man might get along well
enough. But now, first your wife aggrawates you, and
then the law aggrawates you. I'm in a state of aggrawation."</p>

<p>"That all comes from your not knowing law&mdash;them
that don't know it get aggrawated by it, but them that does
know it only aggrawates other people. But you ignorantramusses
are always in trouble, 'specially if you're

<!-- page 190 -->

married. What made you get married if you don't
like it?"</p>

<p>"Why, I was deluded into it&mdash;fairly deluded. I had
nothing to do of evenings, so I went a courting. Now,
courting's fun enough&mdash;I haven't got a word to say agin
courting. It's about as good a way of killing an evening
as I know of. Wash your face, put on a clean dicky,
and go and talk as sweet as nugey or molasses candy
for an hour or two&mdash;to say nothing of a few kisses behind
the door, as your sweetheart goes to the step with
you. The fact is, I've quite a taste and a genus for courting&mdash;it's
all sunshine, and no clouds."</p>

<p>"Well, if you like it so, why didn't you stick to it; it's
easy enough; court all the time, like two pretty people
in a pickter."</p>

<p>"Not so easy as you think for; they won't let a body
court all the time&mdash;that's exactly where the mischief lies.
If you say A, they'll make you say B. The young 'uns
may stand it because they're bashful sometimes, but the
old ladies always interfere, and make you walk right
straightup to the chalk, whether or no. Marry or cut stick&mdash;you
mustn't stand in other people's moonshine. That's
the way they talked to me, and druv' me right into my
own moonshine. They said marrying was fun!&mdash;pooty
fun to be sure!"</p>

<p>"Well, Gammy, I see clear enough you're in a
scrape; but it's a scrape accordin' to law, and so you
can't help your sad sitivation. You must make the best
of it. Better go home and pacify the old lady&mdash;larrupings
don't do any good as I see&mdash;they're not wholesome food
for anybody except bosses and young children"&mdash;and
Montezuma yawned drearily as if anxious to terminate
the colloquy.</p>

<p>"The fact is, Montey&mdash;to tell you a secret&mdash;I've a

<!-- page 191 -->

great mind to walk off. I hate domestic uneasiness, and
there's more of that at my house than there is of eatables
and drinkables by a good deal. I should like to leave it
behind me. A man doesn't want much when he gets
experience and comes to look at things properly&mdash;he
learns that the vally of wives and other extras is tantamount
to nothing&mdash;it's only essentials he cares about.
Now I'm as hungry as a poor box, and as thirsty as a cart
load of sand&mdash;not for water, though; that's said to be
good for navigation and internal improvements, but it
always hurts my wholesome, and I'm principled against
using the raw material&mdash;it's bad for trade. I can't go
home, even if there was any use in it; and so I believe
I'll emigrate&mdash;I'll be a sort of pinioneer, and fly away."</p>

<p>"It can't be allowed. Gammy Gambril. If you try it
and don't get off clear, the law will have you as sure as
a gun&mdash;for this 'ere is one of them 'are pints of law what
grabs hold of you strait&mdash;them husbands as cut stick
must be made examples on. If they wasn't, all the he-biddies
in town would be cutting stick. To allow such
cuttings up and such goings on is taking the mortar out
of society and letting the bricks tumble down. Individuals
must sometimes keep in an uneasy posture, for the
good of the rest of the people. The world's like a flock
of sheep, and if one runs crooked all the rest will be sure
to do the same."</p>

<p>Gamaliel elevated his eyebrows and shrugged his
shoulders in contempt at the application of the abstract
principle to his individual case, and then reverted to his
original train of thought. After rising to his feet, he
turned his eyes upward and struck a classical attitude.</p>

<p>"Marrying fun!" ejaculated he&mdash;"yes, pooty fun!
very pooty!"</p>

<p>"Keep a goin' ahead," said Montezuma Dawkins,

<!-- page 192 -->

poking him with a stick,&mdash;"talk as you go, and let's hear
the rights of it."</p>

<p>"When I was a single man, the world wagged along
well enough. It was jist like an omnibus: I was a passenger,
paid my levy, and hadn't nothing more to do with it
but sit down and not care a button for any thing. S'posing
the omnibus got upsot&mdash;well, I walks off, and leaves the
man to pick up the pieces. But then I must take a wife
and be hanged to me. It's all very well for a while;
but afterwards, it's plaguy like owning an upsot omnibus."</p>

<p>" 'Nan?" queried Montezuma&mdash;"What's all that about
omnibusses?"</p>

<p>"What did I get by it?" continued Gamaliel, regardless
of the interruption. "How much fun?&mdash;why a jawing
old woman and three squallers. Mighty different
from courting that is. What's the fun of buying things
to eat and things to wear for them, and wasting good
spreeing money on such nonsense for other people? And
then, as for doing what you like, there's no such thing.
You can't clear out when people's owing you so much
money you can't stay convenient. No&mdash;the nabbers must
have you. You can't go on a spree; for when you come
home, missus kicks up the devil's delight. You can't
teach her better manners&mdash;for constables are as thick as
blackberries. In short, you can't do nothing. Instead of
'Yes, my duck,' and 'No, my dear,'&mdash;'As you please,
honey,' and 'When you like, lovey,' like it was in courting
times, it's a riglar row at all hours. Sour looks and
cold potatoes; children and table-cloths bad off for soap&mdash;always
darning and mending, and nothing ever darned
and mended. If it wasn't that I'm partickelarly sober,
I'd be inclined to drink&mdash;it's excuse enough. It's heart-breaking,
and it's all owing to that I've such a pain in

<!-- page 193 -->

my gizzard of mornings. I'm so miserable I must stop
and sit on the steps."</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?"</p>

<p>"I'm getting aggrawated. My wife's a savin' critter&mdash;a
sword of sharpness&mdash;she cuts the throat of my felicity,
stabs my happiness, chops up my comforts, and snips up
all my Sunday-go-to-meetings to make jackets for the
boys&mdash;she gives all the wittels to the children, to make
me spry and jump about like a lamp-lighter&mdash;I can't
stand it&mdash;my troubles is overpowering when I come to
add 'em up."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense! behave nice&mdash;don't make a noise
in the street&mdash;be a man."</p>

<p>"How can I be a man, when I belong to somebody
else? My hours ain't my own&mdash;my money ain't my
own&mdash;I belong' to four people besides myself&mdash;the old
woman and them three children. I'm a partnership concern,
and so many has got their fingers in the till that I
must bust up. I'll break, and sign over the stock in
trade to you."</p>

<p>Montezuma, however, declined being the assignee in
the case of the house of Gambril, and finally succeeded
in prevailing upon him to abandon, at least for the present,
his design of becoming a "pinioneer," and to return
to his home. But before Gambril closed the door, he
popped out his head, and cried aloud to his retiring friend,</p>

<p>"I say, Montezuma Dawkins!&mdash;before you go&mdash;if
you know anybody that wants a family complete to
their hands, warranted to scold as loud and as long as
any, I'll sell cheap. I won't run away just yet, but I
want cash, for I'll have another jollification a New Year's
Eve, if I had as many families as I've got fingers and
toes!"</p>

<p>THE CROOKED DISCIPLE;</p>

<p class="small">OR, THE PRIDE OF MUSCLE.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>NATURE too frequently forgets to infuse the sympathies
into the composition of the human race, and hence the
world is afflicted with a flood of evils. Imperfect as
mankind may be in a physical point of view, their moral
defects are immeasurably greater, and these chiefly flow
from the dearth of sympathy. Social offences, as well
as crimes, are in general born from this cause, and the
sins of humanity are to be charged upon selfishness, the
weed that chokes all wholesome plants in the garden of
the heart, and exhausts the soil. It manifests itself in a
variety of ways. In one instance, being combined with
other essentials, it makes a mighty conqueror; in another,
a petty larcenist; one man beats his wife and sots at an
alehouse; another sets the world in a blaze, and dying,
becomes the idol of posterity; all from the same cause&mdash;a
mind concentred on itself.</p>

<p>The forms which govern society were intended to
counteract the aforesaid neglect of dame nature, and to
keep selfishness in check; it having been early discovered
that if every one put his fingers in the dish at
once, a strong chance existed that the contents thereof
would be spilt, and all would be compelled to go home
hungry. It was equally clear that if each individual

<!-- page 195 -->

tucked up his coat-tails, and endeavoured to monopolize
the fire, the whole company would be likely to catch
cold. The canon was therefore issued that "after you"
should be "manners;" and that, however anxious one
may be to get the biggest piece, he should not obey the
promptings of nature by making a direct grab; but rather
effect his object by indirect management&mdash;such as placing
the desired morsel nearest himself, and then handing the
plate&mdash;a species of <i>hocus pocus</i>, which puts the rest of
the company in the vocative, and enables the skill of
civilization quietly to effect that which in earlier times
could only be accomplished by superior force, and at the
hazard of upsetting the table. If sympathy were the
growth of every mind, politeness and deference would be
spontaneous; but as it is not, a substitute&mdash;a sort of
wooden leg for the natural one&mdash;was invented, and hence
"dancing and manners" are a part of refined education.
Wine glasses are placed near the decanter, and tumblers
near the pitcher, that inclination may receive a broad hint,
and that the natural man may not rob the rest of the
company of their share of comfort, by catching up and
draining the vessels at a draught. Chairs stand near the
dinner table to intimate that, however hungry one may
be, it is not the thing to jump upon the board, and,
clutching the whole pig, to gnaw it as a school-boy does
an apple; while plates, with their attendant knives and
forks, show that each one must be content with a portion,
and use his pickers and stealers as little as possible. To
get along smoothly, it was also ordained that we must smile
when it would be more natural to tumble the intruder
out of the window; and that no matter how tired we may
be, we must not, when another is about taking our seat,
pull it from under him, and allow him to bump on the
floor.</p>

<!-- page 196 -->

<p>Although education has done much to supply deficiencies,
and to make mock sympathy out of calves' heads
when the real article is not to be found, yet education,
potent as it is, cannot do all things. "Crooked disciples"
will exist from time to time, and to prove it, let the story
be told of</p>

<p class="center">JACOB GRIGSBY.</p>

<p>Of crooked disciples, Jacob Grigsby is the crookedest.
His disposition is twisted like a ram's horn, and none
can tell in what direction will be the next turn. He is
an independent abstraction&mdash;one of that class, who do
not seem aware that any feelings are to be consulted but
their own, and who take the last bit, as if unconscious
that it is consecrated to that useful divinity "manners;"
lads, who always run in first when the bell rings, and
cannot get their boots off when any body tumbles overboard;
who, when compelled to share their bed with
another, lie in that engrossing posture called "catty-cornered,"
and when obliged to rise early, whistle, sing
and dance, that none may enjoy the slumbers denied to
them;&mdash;in short, he strongly resembles that engaging
species of the human kind, who think it creditable to
talk loud at theatres and concerts, and to encore songs
and concertos which nobody else wants to hear. Grigsby
was born with the idea that the rest of the world,
animate or inanimate, was constructed simply for his
special amusement, and that if it did not answer the purpose,
it was his indefeasible right to declare war against
the offender. When a boy, he was known as a "real
limb"&mdash;of what tree it is unnecessary to specify. He
was an adept in placing musk melon rinds on the pavement
for the accommodation of those elderly gentlemen
whose skating days were over, and many a staid matron
received her most impressive lessons in ground and lofty

<!-- page 197 -->

tumbling, by the aid of cords which he had stretched
across the way. Every child in the neighbourhood
learnt to "see London" through his telescope, and he
was famous for teaching youngsters to write hog Latin
by jerking pens full of ink through their lips. At school
he was remarkable for his science in crooking pins, and
placing them on the seats of the unsuspicious, and ever
since he has continued to be a thorn in the side of those
who are unlucky enough to come in contact with him.</p>

<p>Grigsby has now grown to man's estate&mdash;a small property
in most instances, and in his it must be simply the
interest of his whiskers, which extend some inches beyond
his nose and chin&mdash;he having nothing else clear
of embarrassment. He is said to be more of a limb than
ever, his unaccommodating spirit having increased with
his trunk. The good qualities which were to appear in
him are yet in the soil, no sprouts having manifested
themselves. He is savagely jocular in general, and jocosely
quarrelsome in his cups in particular. He stands
like a bramble in life's highway, and scratches the cuticle
from all that passes.</p>

<p>This amiable individual is particularly fond of cultivating
his physical energies, and one of his chief delights
is in the display of his well practised powers. He sometimes
awakens a friend from a day dream, by a slap on
the shoulder which might be taken for the blow of a cannon
ball. His salutation is accompanied by a grasp of
your hand, so vigorously given that you are painfully
reminded of his affectionate disposition and the strength
of his friendship for a week afterwards; and he smiles to
see his victims writhe under a clutch which bears no
little resemblance in its pressure to the tender embrace
of a smith's vice. To this Herculean quality Grigsby
always recurs with satisfaction, and indeed it must be

<!-- page 198 -->

confessed that superiority, either real or imagined, is a
great source of pleasure in this mundane sphere. There
are few who do not derive satisfaction from believing
that, in some respect, they are more worthy than their
neighbours&mdash;and self-love, if the truth were known, performs
many curious operations to enable its possessor to
enjoy the delight of thinking that there are points in
which he is unsurpassed. Should his countenance be
of the most unprepossessing cast, he gazes in the mirror
until convinced that whatever is lost in beauty, is gained
in expression. Should he have a temper as rash and unreasonable
as the whirlwind, it is to him but a proof of
superior susceptibility and of an energetic will; if thin,
he is satisfied that he possesses a free unencumbered
spirit; and if nature has provided him with a superabundance
of flesh, he comforts himself with the idea of
an imposing aspect, and of being able, physically at least,
to make a figure in the world. The melancholy man,
instead of charging his nervous system with treachery,
or his stomach with disaffection, finds a stream of sunshine
in his gloom, from the impression that it is left to
him alone to see reality divested of its deceptive hues&mdash;and
smiles sourly on the merry soul who bears it as if
existence were a perpetual feast, and as if he were a butterfly
upon an ever-blooming prairie.</p>

<p>The pride of art likewise comes in as a branch of this
scheme of universal comfort. The soldier and the politician
rejoice in their superior skill in tactics and strategie&mdash;and
even if foiled, charge the result upon circumstances
beyond their control; while even the scavenger
plumes himself upon the superior skill and accuracy with
which he can execute the fancy work of sweeping round
a post: but none feel the pride of which we speak more
strongly than those who are addicted to the practice of

<!-- page 199 -->

gymnastics. They have it in every muscle of their
frames; their very coats are buttoned tight across the
breast to express it; and it is exhibited on every possible
occasion. In their dwellings, wo upon the tables and
chairs&mdash;and they cannot see a pair of parallels or cross
bars without experimenting upon them.</p>

<p>At a period when Grigsby was in the full flush of his
gymnastic powers, he returned from a supper late at
night, with several companions. After Grigsby had
created much polite amusement by torturing several dogs
and sundry pigs, they attempted a serenade, but they
were not in voice; and after trying a cotillion and a galopade
in front of the State House, which were not quite
so well executed as might have been desired, they separated,
each to his home&mdash;if he could get there. Grigsby
strolled along humming a tune, until his eye happened
to be greeted by the welcome sight of an awning-post.
He stopped, and regarded it for a long time with critical
gravity.</p>

<p>"This will answer famously," said he. "Tom brags
that he can beat me with his arms; but I don't believe
it. Any how, his legs are no great shakes. There's no
more muscle in them than there is in an unstarched shirt
collar; and I don't believe, if he was to practise for ten
years, he could hang by his toes, swing up and catch
hold. No, that he couldn't; I'm the boy, and I'll exercise
at it."</p>

<p>It is however much easier to resolve than to execute.
Mr. Grigsby found it impossible to place himself in the
requisite antipodean posture.</p>

<p>"Why, what the deuse is the matter? All the supper
must have settled down in my toes, for my boots feel
heavier than fifty-sixes. My feet are completely obfuscated,
while my head is as clear as a bell. But 'never

<!-- page 200 -->

despair' is the motto&mdash;here's at it once more," continued
he, making another desperate but ineffectual effort.</p>

<p>An individual with a white hat and with his hands
deeply immersed in the pockets of his shooting jacket,
now advanced from the tree against which he had been
leaning, while chuckling at the doings of Mr. Grigsby.</p>

<p>"Hay, whiskers, what's the fun in doing that, particularly
when you can't do it?" said he.</p>

<p>"Can you hang by your toes, stranger? Because if
you can, you'll beat Tom, in spite of his bragging."</p>

<p>"I don't believe I can. The fact is, I always try to
keep this side up with care. I never could see the use of
shaking a man up like a bottle of physic. I can mix myself
to my own taste without that."</p>

<p>"You've no taste for the fine arts, whatever you may
have for yourself. Gymnastics stir up the sugar of a
man's constitution, and neutralize the acids. Without
'em, he's no better than a bottle of pepper vinegar&mdash;nothing
but sour punch."</p>

<p>"Very likely, but I'll have neither hand nor foot in
hanging to an awning-post. If it was like the brewer's
horse in Old Grimes, and you could drink up all the beer
by turning your head where your feet should be, perhaps
I might talk to you about it."</p>

<p>Grigsby, however, by dint of expatiating on the beneficial
tendency of gymnastics, at last prevailed upon the
stranger to make the attempt.</p>

<p>"Now," said he, "let me bowse you up, and if you
can hang by your toes, I'll treat handsome."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't care if I do," replied the stranger
with a grin, as he grasped the cross-bar&mdash;"hoist my
heels and look sharp."</p>

<p>Jacob chuckled as he took the stranger by the boots,
intending to give him a fall if possible, and to thrash him

<!-- page 201 -->

if he grumbled; but the victim's hold was insecure, and
he tumbled heavily upon his assistant, both rolling on the
bricks together.</p>

<p>"Fire and tow!" ejaculated Grigsby.</p>

<p>"Now we're mixed nicely," grunted the stranger, as
he scrambled about. "If any man gets more legs and
arms than belong to him, they're mine. Hand over the
odd ones, and let's have a complete set."</p>

<p>"This will never do," said Grigsby, after they had
regained their feet, and still intent on his design. "It
will never do in the world&mdash;you're so confoundedly
awkward. Come, have at it again; once more and the
last."</p>

<p>"Young people," interposed a passing official, "if
you keep a cutting didoes, I must talk to you both like
a Dutch uncle. Each of you must disperse; I can't allow
no insurrection about the premises. If you ain't got no
dead-latch key, and the nigger won't set up, why I'll
take you to the corporation free-and-easy, and lock you
up till daylight, and we'll fetch a walk after breakfast
to converse with his honour on matters and things in
general."</p>

<p>"Very well," answered Grigsby&mdash;"but now you've
made your speech, do you think you could hang by your
toes to that post?"</p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh! don't be redikalis. When matters is
solemn, treat 'em solemn."</p>

<p>"Why, I ain't redikalis&mdash;we're at work on science.
I'm pretty well scienced myself, and I want to get
more so."</p>

<p>"Instead of talking, you'd better paddle up street like
a white-head. Go home to sleep like your crony&mdash;see
how he shins it."</p>

<p>"I will," said Grigsby, who likes a joke occasionally,

<!-- page 202 -->

and is very good humoured when it is not safe to be
otherwise&mdash;"I will, if you'll tell me what's the use. In
the first place, home's a fool to this&mdash;and as for sleeping,
it's neither useful nor ornamental."

"Do go, that's a good boy&mdash;I don't want to chaw you
right up, but I must if you stay."</p>

<p>"I snore when I'm asleep&mdash;and when I do, Tom
puts his foot out of bed till it's cold, and then claps it to
my back. He calls it firing me off on the cold pressure
principle."</p>

<p>"What a cruel Tom! But why don't you keep your
mouth shut? You should never wear it open when you're
asleep."</p>

<p>"If I did, my dreams would get smothered. Besides,
I like to look down my throat, to see what I'm thinking
about."</p>

<p>"Don't quiz me, young man. Some things is easy to
put up with, and some things isn't easy to put up with;
and quizzing a dignittery is one of the last. If there is
any thing I stands upon, it's dignitty."</p>

<p>"Dignitty made of pipe-stems, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"My legs is pretty legs. They ain't so expressive as
some what's made coarser and cheaper; but they're slim
and genteel. But legs are neither here nor there. You
must go home, sonny, or go with me."</p>

<p>"Well, as I'm rather select in my associations, and
never did admire sleeping thicker than six in a bed at the
outside, I'll go home, put a woollen stocking on Tom's
foot, and take a pint of sleep: I never try more, for my
constitution won't stand it. But to-morrow I'll swing by
my toes, I promise you."</p>

<p>"Go, then. Less palaver and more tortle."</p>

<p>"<i>Tortelons nous</i>&mdash;good night; I'm off to my <i>lit</i>."

<p>The <i>censor morum</i> wrapping himself in his consequence,

<!-- page 203 -->

paused, looked grave until Grigsby turned the
corner, and then, relaxing his <i>dignitty</i>, laughed creakingly,
like a rusty door.</p>

<p>"Hee! hee! hee!&mdash;that's a real fine feller. He's too
good for his own good&mdash;makes something of a fuss every
night&mdash;always funny or fighting, and never pays his debts.
Hee! hee! hee! a real gentleman&mdash;gives me half a dollar
a New Year's&mdash;a real&mdash;past two o'clock and a cloudy
morning!&mdash;sort of a gentleman, and encourages our business
like an emperor, only I haven't got the heart to take
advantage of it."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Jacob Grigsby moved homeward, his temper souring as
he proceeded and as the pleasant excitement of the evening
began to wear off. Some people, by the way, are
always good humoured abroad, and reserve their savage
traits for home consumption. Of this class is Grigsby.</p>

<p>Where he boards, the rule is to stow thick&mdash;three in a
bed when the weather is warm, and, in the colder season,
by way of saving blankets, four in a bed is the rule.
Now, even three in a bed is by no means a pleasant
arrangement at the best, when the parties are docile in
their slumbers, and lie "spoon fashion," all facing the
same way, and it is terrible if one of the triad be of an
uneasy disposition. Grigsby's "pardeners," however,
are quiet lads, and there is an understanding among the
three that turn about shall be the law in regard to the
middle place, which therefore falls to his share every third
week&mdash;one week in, and two weeks out&mdash;the soft never
to be monopolized by any one individual, and nobody to
turn round more than once in the course of the night.
Grigsby is borne down by the majority; but when it is his
week in, he is worse than the armed rhinoceros or the
Hyrcan tiger, so ferocious are his ebullitions of wrath.</p>

<!-- page 204 -->

<p>It happened to be his week "in," the thought whereof
moved his ire, and he ascended the stairs with the
energetic tread of an ox, set fire to the cat's tail with the
candle, and poked a long nine down Carlo's throat.</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Jacob, as he kicked open the door, surveyed
his sleeping bedfellows, and flashed the light in
their eyes&mdash;"mighty comfortable that, anyhow; but I'll
soon spoil it, or I'm not a true Grigsby."</p>

<p>He put out the light, and in full dress&mdash;boots, hat,
great coat, body coat, and pantaloons&mdash;muddy as he was,
scrambled over the bed two or three times, until he established
himself in the central station between his co-mates.
He rolled and he tossed, he kicked and he groaned,
until the whole concern were as wide awake as himself.</p>

<p>"Why, Jacob, you've got your boots on," said they.</p>

<p>"The fact is, fellows, the cold in my head is getting
worse, and sleeping in boots draws down the inflammation.
It's a certain cure."</p>

<p>"But you don't intend sleeping with your hat on your
head, do you?"</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you I've got holes in my stockings? If
I don't keep my hat on, I'll be sure to have the rheumatism
in my big toe."</p>

<p>"Well, we won't stand it, no how it can be fixed."</p>

<p>"Just as you like&mdash;go somewhere else&mdash;I've no objection.
I'm amazing comfortable."</p>

<p>"Why, thunder and fury!" said one, jerking up his
leg, "your boots are covered with mud."</p>

<p>"That <i>are</i> a fact&mdash;you've no idea how muddy the
streets are&mdash;I'm all over mud&mdash;I wish you'd blow up the
corporation. But hang it, give us a fip's worth of sheet
and a 'levy's worth of blanket. That's the way I like
'em mixed&mdash;some lean and a good deal of fat."</p>

<p>So saying, Jacob wound himself up in the bed-clothes

<!-- page 205 -->

with a prodigious flounder, denuding his companions
entirely.</p>

<p>Grigsby's co-mates however, knowing that "who
would be free, themselves must strike the blow," declared
war against the manifold outrages of their oppressor,
and, notwithstanding his gymnastic powers, succeeded in
obtaining the mastery. Much enraged, they resolved
upon carrying him down stairs and placing him under
the hydrant as a punishment for his violations of the
social compact, and were proceeding to put their determination
in force, when Bobolink and the rest of the
boarders, alarmed at the noise, popped out of their chambers.</p>

<p>"What's the fraction&mdash;vulgar or decimal?" said Bobolink.</p>

<p>"Vengeance!" panted Grigsby&mdash;"revenge! I'm insulted&mdash;let
me go!"</p>

<p>The cause of quarrel was explained&mdash;all cried shame
upon Mr. Jacob Grigsby, and Mr. Bobolink constituted
himself judge on the occasion.</p>

<p>"They kicked me!" roared the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Bobolink, "but as they hadn't their
boots on, it wasn't downright Mayor's court assault and
battery&mdash;only an insult with intent to hurt&mdash;assault and
battery in the second degree&mdash;a species of accidental
homicide. Perhaps you were going down stairs, and they
walked too quick after you&mdash;toeing it swift, and 'most
walked into you. What was it for?"</p>

<p>"Look ye," said Grigsby&mdash;"it's very late&mdash;yes, it's
nearly morning, and I didn't take time to fix myself for
a regular sleep, so I turned in like a trooper's horse, and
that's the whole matter."</p>

<p>"Like a trooper's horse&mdash;how's that?"</p>

<p>"I'll explain," said one of the spectators&mdash;"to turn

<!-- page 206 -->

in like a trooper's horse is to go to bed all standing,
ready for a sudden call&mdash;parade order&mdash;winter uniform&mdash;full
dress&mdash;a very good fashion when you've been out to
supper&mdash;convenient in case of fire, and saves a deal of
trouble in the morning when you're late for breakfast."</p>

<p>"Well, I never heard tell of the likes on the part of a
white man. They served you right, and my judgment is,
as you won't be quiet, that you be shut in the back-cellar
till breakfast time. I'm not going to have any more row.
If you don't like it, you can appeal afterwards."</p>

<p>"Never heerd the likes!" said Jacob contemptuously;
"ain't a bed a bed&mdash;ain't my share of it, my share
of it?&mdash;and where's the law that lays down what sort of
clothes a man must sleep in? I'll wear a porcupine jacket,
and sleep in it too, if I like&mdash;yes, spurs, and a trumpet,
and a spanner."</p>

<p>"Put him in the cellar," was the reply, and in spite
of his struggles the sentence was laughingly enforced.</p>

<p>"Bobolink, let's out, or I'll burst the door&mdash;let's out&mdash;I
want vengeance!"</p>

<p>"Keep yourself easy&mdash;you can't have any vengeance
till morning. Perhaps they'll wrap some in a bit of paper,
and keep it for you."</p>

<p>But in the morning Grigsby disappeared, and returned
no more.</p>

<p>FYDGET FYXINGTON.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>THE illustrious Pangloss, who taught the metaphysico-theologo-cosmolo-nigology
at the Westphalian chateau
of the puissant Baron Thundertentronckh, held it
as a cardinal maxim of his philosophy, <i>que tout est
au mieux</i>; that "it's all for the best." Pangloss
was therefore what is called an optimist, and discontent&mdash;to
use the favourite word of the slang-whangers&mdash;was
repudiated by him and his followers. This doctrine,
however, though cherished in the abstract, is but little
practised out of the domain of Thundertentronckh. The
world is much more addicted to its opposite. "All's for
the worst" is a very common motto, and under its influence
there are thousands who growl when they go to bed,
and growl still louder when they get up; they growl at
their breakfast, they growl at their dinner, they growl at
their supper, and they growl between meals. Discontent
is written in every feature of their visage; and they go
on from the beginning of life until its close, always growling,
in the hope of making things better by scaring them
into it with ugly noises. These be your passive grumbletonians.
When the castle was on fire, Sir Abel Handy
stood wringing his hands, in expectation that the fire
would be civil enough to go out of itself. So is it with
the passive. He would utter divers maledictions upon
the heat, but would sit still to see if the flame could not
be scolded into going out of itself.</p>

<!-- page 208 -->

<p>The active grumbletonians, however, though equally
opposed in practice to the metaphysico-theologo-cosmolo-nigology,
are a very different race of mortals from
the passives. The world is largely indebted to them for
every comfort and convenience with which it abounds;
and they laugh at the inquiry whether their exertions
have conduced to the general happiness, holding it that
happiness consists chiefly in exertion&mdash;to which the passives
demur, as they look back with no little regret to
the lazy days of pastoral life, when Chaldean shepherds
lounged upon the grass. The actives are very much
inclined to believe that whatever is, is wrong; but
then they have as an offset, the comfortable conviction
that they are able to set it right&mdash;an opinion which fire
cannot melt out of them. These restless fellows are in
a vast majority; and hence it is that the surface of this
earthly sphere is such a scene of activity; hence it is that
for so many thousand years, the greater part of each
generation has been unceasingly employed in labour and
bustle; rushing from place to place; hammering, sawing,
and driving; hewing down and piling up mountains; and
unappalled, meeting disease and death, both by sea and
land. To expedite the process of putting things to rights,
likewise, hence it is that whole hecatombs of men have
been slaughtered on the embattled field, and that the cord,
the fagot, and the steel have been in such frequent demand.
Sections of the active grumbletonians sometimes
differ about the means of making the world a more comfortable
place, and time being short, the labour-saving
process is adopted. The weaker party is knocked on
the head. It saves an incalculable deal of argument, and
answers pretty nearly the same end.</p>

<p>But yet, though the world is many years old, and
the "fixing process" has been going on ever since it

<!-- page 209 -->

emerged from chaos, it seems that much remains undone,
with less time to do it in. The actives consequently
redouble their activity. They have called in the aid of
gunpowder and steam, and in this goodly nineteenth century
are kicking up such a terrible dust, and are setting
things to rights at such a rate, that the passives have no
comfort of their lives. Where they herd in nations, as in
Mexico, the actives cluster on their borders and set things
to rights with the rifle; and when they are solitary amid
the crowd, as among us, they are fretted to fiddlestrings,
like plodding shaft horses with unruly leaders. They are
environed with perils. In one quarter, hundreds of
stately mansions are brought thundering to the ground,
because the last generation put things to rights in the
wrong way, and in another quarter, thousands are going
up on the true principle. Between them both, the passive
is kept in a constant state of solicitude, and threads
his way through piles of rubbish, wearing his head askew
like a listening chicken, looking above with one eye, to
watch what may fall on him, and looking below with the
other, to see what he may fall upon. Should he travel, he is
placed in a patent exploding steamboat, warranted to boil
a gentleman cold in less than no time; or he is tied to the
tail of a big steam kettle, termed a locomotive, which
goes sixty miles an hour horizontally, or if it should meet
impediment, a mile in half a second perpendicularly.
Should he die, as many do, of fixo-phobia, and seek peace
under the sod, the spirit of the age soon grasps the spade
and has him out to make way for improvement.</p>

<p>The passive grumbletonian is useless to himself and
to others: the active grumbletonian is just the reverse.
In general, he combines individual advancement with
public prosperity; but there are exceptions even in that
class&mdash;men, who try to take so much care of the world

<!-- page 210 -->

that they forget themselves, and, of course, fail in their
intent.</p>

<p>Such a man is Fydget Fyxington, an amelioration-of-the-human-race-by-starting-from-first-principles-philosopher.
Fydget's abstract principle, particularly in
matters of government and of morals, is doubtless a
sound rule; but he looks so much at the beginning
that he rarely arrives at the end, and when he advances
at all, he marches backward, his face being directed toward
the starting place instead of the goal. By this
means he may perhaps plough a straight furrow, but instead
of curving round obstructions, he is very apt to be
thrown down by them.</p>

<p>Like most philosophers who entertain a creed opposed
to that of the illustrious Pangloss, Fydget may be fitly
designated as the fleshless one. He never knew the joy
of being fat, and is one of those who may console themselves
with the belief that the physical sharpness which
renders them a walking <i>chevaux de frise</i>, and as dangerous
to embrace as a porcupine, is but an outward emblem
of the acuteness of the mind. Should he be thrust in a
crowd against a sulky fellow better in flesh than himself,
who complains of the pointedness of his attentions, Fydget
may reflect that even so do his reasoning faculties
bore into a subject. When gazing in a mirror, should
his eye be offended by the view of lantern jaws, and
channelled cheeks, and bones prematurely labouring to
escape from their cuticular tabernacle, he may easily
figure to himself the restless energy of his spirit, which
like a keen blade, weareth away the scabbard&mdash;he may
look upon himself as an intellectual "cut and thrust"&mdash;a
thinking chopper and stabber. But it may be doubted
whether Fydget ever reverts to considerations so purely
selfish, except when he finds that the "fine points" of

<!-- page 211 -->

his figure are decidedly injurious to wearing apparel and
tear his clothes.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Winter ruled the hour when Fydget Fyxington was
last observed to be in circulation&mdash;winter, when men
wear their hands in their pockets and seldom straighten
their backs&mdash;a season however, which, though sharp and
biting in its temper, has redeeming traits. There is something
peculiarly exhilarating in the sight of new-fallen
snow. The storm which brings it is not without a charm.
The graceful eddying of the drifts sported with by the
wind, and the silent gliding of the feathery flakes, as one
by one they settle upon the earth like fairy creatures
dropping to repose, have a soothing influence not easily
described, though doubtless felt by all. But when the
clouds, having performed their office, roll away, and the
brightness of the morning sun beams upon an expanse
of sparkling, unsullied whiteness; when all that is common-place,
coarse, and unpleasant in aspect, is veiled for
the time, and made to wear a fresh and dazzling garb,
new animation is felt by the spirit. The young grow
riotous with joy, and their merry voices ring like bells
through the clear and bracing air; while the remembrance
of earlier days gives a youthful impulse to the
aged heart.</p>

<p>But to all this there is a sad reverse. The resolution
of these enchantments into their original elements by
means of a thaw, is a necessary, but, it must be confessed,
a very doleful process, fruitful in gloom, rheum, inflammations,
and fevers&mdash;a process which gives additional
pangs to the melancholic, and causes valour's self to
droop like unstarched muslin. The voices of the boys
are hushed; the whizzing snow-ball astonishes the unsuspicious
wayfarer no more; the window glass is permitted

<!-- page 212 -->

to live its brief day, safe from an untimely fracture,
and the dejected urchin sneaks moodily from school.
So changed is his nature, that he scarcely bestows a derisive
grin upon the forlorn sleigh, which ploughs its
course through mud and water, although its driver and
his passengers invite the jeer by making themselves small
to avoid it, and tempt a joke by oblique glances to see
whether it is coming.</p>

<p>Such a time was it when Fydget was extant&mdash;a sloppy
time in January. The city, it is true, was clothed in
snow; but it was melancholy snow, rusty and forlorn
in aspect, and weeping, as if in sorrow that its original
purity had become soiled, stained, and spotted by contact
with the world. Its whiteness had in a measure disappeared,
by the pressure of human footsteps; wheels and
runners had almost incorporated it with the common
earth; and, where these had failed in effectually doing
the work, remorseless distributers of ashes, coal dust,
and potato peelings, had lent their aid to give uniformity
to the dingy hue. But the snow, "weeping its spirit
from its eyes," and its body too, was fast escaping from
these multiplied oppressions and contumelies. Large
and heavy drops splashed from the eaves; sluggish streams
rolled lazily from the alleys, and the gutters and crossings
formed vast shallow lakes, variegated by glaciers
and ice islands. They who roamed abroad at this unpropitious
time, could be heard approaching by the damp
sucking sound which emanated from their boots, as they
alternately pumped in and pumped out the water in their
progress, and it was thus that our hero travelled, having
no caoutchouc health-preservers to shield his pedals from
unwholesome contact.</p>

<p>The shades of evening were beginning to thicken, when
Fydget stopped shiveringly and looked through the glass

<!-- page 213 -->

door of a fashionable hotel&mdash;the blazing fire and the
numerous lights, by the force of contrast, made an outside
seat still more uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The gong pealed out that tea was ready, and the
lodgers rushed from the stoves to comfort themselves
with that exhilarating fluid.</p>

<p>"There they go on first principles," said Fydget Fyxington
with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Cla' de kitchen da'," said one of those ultra-aristocratic
members of society, a negro waiter, as he bustled
past the contemplative philosopher and entered the hotel&mdash;"you
ought to be gwang home to suppa', ole soul, if
you got some&mdash;yaugh&mdash;waugh!"</p>

<p>"Suppa', you nigga'!" contemptuously responded
Fydget, as the door closed&mdash;"I wish I was gwang home
to suppa', but suppers are a sort of thing I remember a
good deal oftener than I see. Every thing is wrong&mdash;such
a wandering from first principles!&mdash;there must be
enough in this world for us all, or we wouldn't be here;
but things is fixed so badly that I s'pose some greedy
rascal gets my share of suppa' and other such elegant
luxuries. It's just the way of the world; there's plenty
of shares of every thing, but somehow or other there are
folks that lay their fingers on two or three shares, and
sometimes more, according as they get a chance, and the
real owners, like me, may go whistle. They've fixed it
so that if you go back to first principles and try to bone
what belongs to you, they pack you right off to jail,
'cause you can't prove property. Empty stummicks and
old clothes ain't good evidence in court.</p>

<p>"What the deuse is to become of me! Something
must&mdash;and I wish it would be quick and hurra about it.
My clothes are getting to be too much of the summer-house
order for the winter fashions. People will soon

<!-- page 214 -->

see too much of me&mdash;not that I care much about looks
myself, but boys is boys, and all boys is sassy. Since
the weather's been chilly, when I turn the corner to go
up town, I feel as if the house had too many windows
and doors, and I'm almost blow'd out of my coat and
pants. The fact is, I don't get enough to eat to serve for
ballast."</p>

<p>After a melancholy pause, Fydget, seeing the coast
tolerably clear, walked in to warm himself at the fire
in the bar-room, near which he stood with great composure,
at the same time emptying several glasses of
comfortable compounds which had been left partly filled
by the lodgers when they hurried to their tea. Lighting a
cigar which he found half smoked upon the ledge of
the stove, he seated himself and puffed away much at his
ease.</p>

<p>The inmates of the hotel began to return to the room,
glancing suspiciously at Fydget's tattered integuments,
and drawing their chairs away from him as they sat
down near the stove, Fydget looked unconscious, emitting
volumes of smoke, and knocking off the ashes with
a nonchalant and scientific air.</p>

<p>"Bad weather," said Brown.</p>

<p>"I've noticed that the weather is frequently bad in
winter, especially about the middle of it, and at both
ends," added Green. "I keep a memorandum book on
the subject, and can't be mistaken."</p>

<p>"It's raining now," said Griffinhoff&mdash;"what's the use
of that when it's so wet under foot already?"</p>

<p>"It very frequently rains at the close of a thaw,
and it's beneficial to the umbrella makers." responded
Green.</p>

<p>"Nothin's fixed no how," said Fydget with great
energy, for he was tired of listening.</p>

<!-- page 215 -->

<p>Brown, Green, Griffinhoff, and the rest started and
stared.</p>

<p>"Nothin's fixed no how," continued Fydget rejoicing
in the fact of having hearers&mdash;"our grand-dads must a
been lazy rascals. Why didn't they roof over the side
walks, and not leave every thing for us to do? I ain't got
no numbrell, and besides that, when it comes down as if
raining was no name for it, as it always does when I'm
cotch'd out, numbrells is no great shakes if you've got
one with you, and no shakes at all if it's at home."</p>

<p>"Who's the indevidjual?" inquired Cameo Calliper,
Esq., looking at Fydget through a pair of lorgnettes.</p>

<p>Fydget returned the glance by making an opera glass
with each fist, and then continued his remarks: "It's a
pity we ain't got feathers, so's to grow our own jacket
and trousers, and do up the tailorin' business, and make
our own feather beds. It would be a great savin'&mdash;every
man his own clothes, and every man his own feather bed.
Now I've got a suggestion about that&mdash;first principles
bring us to the skin&mdash;fortify that, and the matter's done.
How would it do to bile a big kittle full of tar, tallow,
beeswax and injen rubber, with considerable wool, and
dab the whole family once a week? The young 'uns
might be soused in it every Saturday night, and the nigger
might fix the elderly folks with a whitewash brush.
Then there wouldn't be no bother a washing your clothes
or yourself, which last is an invention of the doctor to
make people sick, because it lets in the cold in winter and
the heat in summer, when natur' says shut up the porouses
and keep 'em out. Besides, when the new invention
was tore at the knees or wore at the elbows, just tell
the nigger to put on the kittle and give you a dab, and
you're patched slick&mdash;and so that whole mobs of people
mightn't stick together like figs, a little sperrits of turpentine

<!-- page 216 -->

or litharage might be added to make 'em dry like a
house-a-fire."</p>

<p>"If that fellow don't go away, I'll hurt him," said
Griffinhoff <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>

<p>"Where's a waiter?" inquired Cameo Calliper edging
off in alarm.</p>

<p>"He's crazy," said Green&mdash;"I was at the hospital
once, and there was a man in the place who&mdash;"</p>

<p>" 'Twould be nice for sojers," added Fyxington, as
he threw away his stump, and very deliberately reached
over and helped himself to a fresh cigar, from a number
which Mr. Green had just brought from the bar and held
in his hand&mdash;"I'll trouble you for a little of your fire,"
continued he, taking the cigar from the mouth of Mr.
Green, and after obtaining a light, again placing the
borrowed Habana within the lips of that worthy individual,
who sat stupified at the audacity of the supposed
maniac. Fydget gave the conventional grin of thanks
peculiar to such occasions, and with a graceful wave of his
hand, resumed the thread of his lecture,&mdash;" 'Twould be
nice for sojers. Stand 'em all of a row, and whitewash
'em blue or red, according to pattern, as if they were a
fence. The gin'rals might look on to see if it was done
according to Gunter; the cap'ins might flourish the brush,
and the corpulars carry the bucket. Dandies could fix
themselves all sorts of streaked and all sorts of colours.
When the parterials is cheap and the making don't cost
nothing, that's what I call economy, and coming as
near as possible to first principles. It's a better way,
too, of keeping out the rain, than my t'other plan
of flogging people when they're young, to make their
hides hard and waterproof. A good licking is a sound
first principle for juveniles, but they've got a prejudice
agin it."</p>

<!-- page 217 -->

<p>"Waiter!" cried Cameo Calliper.</p>

<p>"Sa!"</p>

<p>"Remove the incumbent&mdash;expose him to the atmosphere!"</p>

<p>"If you hadn't said that, I'd wopped him," observed
Griffinhoff.</p>

<p>"Accordin' to first principles, I've as good a right to
be here as any body," remarked Fydget indignantly.</p>

<p>"Cut you' stick, 'cumbent&mdash;take you'sef off, trash!"
said the waiter, keeping at a respectful distance.</p>

<p>"Don't come near me. Sip," growled Fydget, doubling
his fist&mdash;"don't come near me, or I'll develope a
first principle and 'lucidate a simple idea for you&mdash;I'll
give you a touch of natur' without no gloves on&mdash;but I'll
not stay, though I've a clear right to do it, unless you are
able&mdash;yes, sassy able!&mdash;to put me out. If there is
any thing I scorns it's prejudice, and this room's so
full of it and smoke together that I won't stay. Your
cigar, sir," added Fydget, tossing the stump to Mr.
Green and retiring slowly.</p>

<p>"That fellow's brazen enough to collect militia fines,"
said Brown, "and so thin and bony, that if pasted over
with white paper and rigged athwart ships, he'd make a
pretty good sign for an oyster cellar."</p>

<p>The rest of the company laughed nervously, as if not
perfectly sure that Fydget was out of hearing.</p>

<p>"The world's full of it&mdash;nothin' but prejudice. I'm
always served the same way, and though I've so much to
do planning the world's good, I can't attend to my own
business, it not only won't support me, but it treats me
with despise and unbecoming freedery. Now, I was used
sinful about my universal language, which every body
can understand, which makes no noise, and which don't

<!-- page 218 -->

convolve no wear and tear of the tongue. It's the patent
anti-fatigue-anti-consumption omnibus linguister, to be
done by winking and blinking, and cocking your eye, the
way the cat-fishes make Fourth of July orations. I was
going to have it introduced in Congress, to save the expense
of anchovies and more porter; but t'other day I
tried it on a feller in the street; I danced right up to him,
and began can&oelig;uvering my daylights to ask him what
o'clock it was, and I'm blow'd if he didn't swear I was
crazy, up fist and stop debate, by putting it to me right
atween the eyes, so that I've been pretty well bung'd up
about the peepers ever since, by a feller too who couldn't
understand a simple idea. That was worse than the kick
a feller gave me in market, because 'cording to first principles
I put a bullowney sassinger into my pocket, and
didn't pay for it. The 'riginal law, which you may see
in children, says when you ain't got no money, the next
best thing is to grab and run. I did grab and run,
but he grabb'd me, and I had to trot back agin, which
always hurts my feelin's and stops the march of mind.
He wouldn't hear me 'lucidate the simple idea, and the
way he hauled out the sassinger, and lent me the loan
of his foot, was werry sewere. It was unsatisfactory and
discombobberative, and made me wish I could find out
the hurtin' principle and have it 'radicated."</p>

<p>Carriages were driving up to the door of a house brilliantly
illuminated, in one of the fashionable streets, and
the music which pealed from within intimated that the
merry dance was on foot.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' in," said Fydget&mdash;"I'm not afeard&mdash;if we
go on first principles we ain't afeard of nothin', and since
they've monopolized my sheer of fun, they can't do less
than give me a shinplaster to go away. My jacket's so
wet with the rain, if I don't get dry I'll be sewed up and

<!-- page 219 -->

have <i>hic jacket</i> wrote atop of me, which means defuncted
of toggery not imprevious to water. In I go."</p>

<p>In accordance with this design, he watched his opportunity
and slipped quietly into the gay mansion. Helping
himself liberally to refreshments left in the hall, he looked
in upon the dancers.</p>

<p>"Who-o-ip!" shouted Fydget Fyxington, forgetting
himself in the excitement of the scene&mdash;"Who-o-ip!"
added he, as he danced forward with prodigious vigour
and activity, flourishing the eatables with which his hands
were crammed, as if they were a pair of cymbals&mdash;"Whurro-o-o!
plank it down&mdash;that's your sort!&mdash;make
yourselves merry, gals and boys&mdash;it's all accordin' to first
principles&mdash;whoo-o-o-ya&mdash;whoop!&mdash;it takes us!"</p>

<p>Direful was the screaming at this formidable apparition&mdash;the
fiddles ceased&mdash;the waltzers dropped their panting
burdens, and the black band looked pale and aghast.</p>

<p>"Who-o-o-p! go ahead!&mdash;come it strong!" continued
Fydget.</p>

<p>But he was again doomed to suffer an ejectment.</p>

<p>"Hustle him out!"</p>

<p>"Give us a 'shinplaster' then&mdash;them's my terms."</p>

<p>It would not do&mdash;he was compelled to retire shinplasterless;
but it rained so heavily that, nothing daunted, he
marched up the alley-way, re-entered the house through
the garden, and gliding noiselessly into the cellar, turned
a large barrel over which he found there, and getting into
it, went fast asleep "on first principles."</p>

<p>The company had departed&mdash;the servants were assembled
in the kitchen preparatory to retiring for the
night, when an unearthly noise proceeding from the barrel
aforesaid struck upon their astonished ears. It was
Fydget snoring, and his hearers, screaming, fled.</p>

<p>Rallying, however, at the top of the stairs, they procured

<!-- page 220 -->

the aid of Mr. Lynx, who watched over the nocturnal
destinies of an unfinished building in the vicinity,
and who, having frequently boasted of his valour, felt it
to be a point of honour to act bravely on this occasion.
The sounds continued, and the "investigating committee,"
with Mr. Lynx as chairman, advanced slowly and
with many pauses.</p>

<p>Lynx at last hurriedly thrust his club into the barrel,
and started back to wait the result of the experiment.
"Ouch!" ejaculated a voice from the interior, the word
being one not to be found in the dictionaries, but which,
in common parlance, means that a sensation too acute to
be agreeable has been excited.</p>

<p>"Hey!&mdash;hello!&mdash;come out of that," said Lynx, as
soon as his nerves had recovered tranquillity. "You are
in a bad box whoever you are."</p>

<p>"Augh!" was the response, "no, I ain't&mdash;I'm in a
barrel."</p>

<p>"No matter," added Lynx authoritatively; "getting
into another man's barrel unbeknownst to him in the
night-time, is burglary."</p>

<p>"That," said Fydget, putting out his head like a terrapin,
at which the women shrieked and retreated, and
Lynx made a demonstration with his club&mdash;"that's
because you ain't up to first principles&mdash;keep your stick
out of my ribs&mdash;I've a plan so there won't be no burglary,
which is this&mdash;no man have no more than he can
use, and all other men mind their own business. Then,
this 'ere barrel would be mine while I'm in it, and you'd
be asleep&mdash;that's the idea."</p>

<p>"It's a logo-fogie!" exclaimed Lynx with horror&mdash;"a
right down logo-fogie!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" screamed the servants&mdash;"a logo-fogie!&mdash;how
did it get out?&mdash;will it bite?&mdash;can't you get a gun?"</p>

<!-- page 221 -->

<p>"Don't be fools&mdash;a logo-fogie is a sort of a man that
don't think as I do&mdash;wicked critters all such sort of people
are," said Lynx. "My lad, I'm pretty clear you're
a logo-fogie&mdash;you talk as if your respect for me and
other venerable institutions was tantamount to very little.
You're a leveller I see, and wouldn't mind knocking me
down flat as a pancake, if so be you could run away and
get out of this scrape&mdash;you're a 'grarium, and would cut
across the lot like a streak of lightning if you had a
chance."</p>

<p>"Mr. Lynx," said the lady of the house from the head
of the stairs,&mdash;she had heard from one of the affrighted
maids that a "logo-fogie" had been "captivated," and
that it could talk "just like a human"&mdash;"Mr. Lynx,
don't have any thing to say to him. Take him out, and
hand him over to the police. I'll see that you are recompensed
for your trouble."</p>

<p>"Come out, then&mdash;you're a bad chap&mdash;you wouldn't
mind voting against our side at the next election."</p>

<p>"We don't want elections, I tell you," said Fydget
coolly, as he walked up stairs&mdash;"I've a plan for doing
without elections, and police-officers, and laws&mdash;every
man mind his own business, and support me while I oversee
him. I can fix it."</p>

<p>Having now arrived at the street, Mr. Lynx held him
by the collar, and looked about for a representative of justice
to relieve him of his prize.</p>

<p>"Though I feel as if I was your pa, yet you must be
tried for snoozling in a barrel. Besides, you've no respect
for functionaries, and you sort of want to cut a piece out
of the common veal by your logo-fogieism in wishing to
'bolish laws, and policers, and watchmen, when my
brother's one, and helps to govern the nation when the

<!-- page 222 -->

President, the Mayor, and the rest of the day-watch has
turned in, or are at a tea-party. You'll get into prison."</p>

<p>"We don't want prisons."</p>

<p>"Yes we do though&mdash;what's to become of functionaries
if there ain't any prisons?"</p>

<p>This was rather a puzzling question. Fyxington
paused, and finally said:</p>

<p>"Why, I've a plan."</p>

<p>"What is it, then&mdash;is it logo-fogie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it upsets existing institutions," roared Fyxington,
tripping up Mr. Lynx, and making his escape&mdash;the
only one of his plans that ever answered the purpose.</p>

<p class="small">OR, THE MISFORTUNES OF PETER FABER.</p>

</div>

<p>IT was a lovely autumnal morning. The air was fresh,
with just enough of frost about it to give ruddiness to the
cheek and brilliancy to the eye. The rays of the sun
streamed brightly up the street; knockers, door-plates, and
bell-handles, beamed with more than usual lustre; while
they who had achieved their breakfasts, and had no fear of
duns, went, according to the bias of their musical fancy,
either whistling or singing through the town, as if they had
finally dissolved partnership with care, and had nothing else
to do for the remainder of their natural lives but to be as
merry as grigs and as frolicsome as kittens. Every one, even
to the heavy-footed, displayed elasticity of step and buoyancy
of motion. There were some who seemed to have a
disposition to dance from place to place, and evidently found
it difficult to refrain from a pirouette around the corner, or a
pigeon-wing across the way, in evidence of the lightheartedness
that prevailed within. The atmosphere had a silent
music in it, more delicious than orchestral strains, and none
could resist its charm, who were not insensible in mind and
body to the innocent delight which is thus afforded to the
healthful spirit. There are mornings in this variable climate
of ours more exhilarating than the wines of the banquet.

<!-- page 8 -->

There are days which seem to be a f&ecirc;te opened to all
the world. The festive hall, with its blaze of chandeliers
and its feverish jollity, has no pleasure in its joys to
equal nature's holyday, which demands no hollow cheek
or haggard eye in recompense. Enjoyment here has no
remorse.</p>

<p>No wonder, then, that young men slapped their comrades
on the back with a merry laugh, and dealt in mirthful salutations.
Nor could it cause surprise that old men poked
their cronies with a stick, and thought that it was funny.
Ay, there are moments when our frail humanity is forgotten&mdash;when
years and sorrow roll away together&mdash;when time
slackens its iron hold upon us&mdash;when pain, tears, disappointments,
and contrition, cease to bear down the spirit, and
for a little moment grant it leave to sport awhile in pristine
gleefulness&mdash;when, indeed we scarcely recognise our care-worn
selves, and have, as it were, brief glimpses of a new
existence.</p>

<p>Still, however, this is a world of violent contrasts, and of
painful incongruities. Some of us may laugh; but while we
laugh, let us be assured of it that there are others who are
weeping. It is pleasant all about you here, within your
brief horizon, but the distance may be short to scenes most
sadly different. Smiles are on your brow, as you jostle
through the street, yet your elbow touches him whose heart
is torn with grief. Is there a merry-making in your family&mdash;are
friends in congregation there with mirth, and dance,
and song? How strange to think that it is scarce a step to
the couch of suffering or the chamber of despair. The air
is tremulous, perchance, with sighs and groans; and though
our joyous strains overwhelm all sorrow's breathings, yet
the sorrow still exists even when we hear it not.</p>

<p>And so it was on this autumnal morning. While the very
air had delight in it, and while happiness pervaded the atmosphere,
there was a little man who felt it not&mdash;poor little
man&mdash;poor grim little man&mdash;poor queer little man&mdash;poor

<!-- page 9 -->

little man disconsolate. Sadness had engrossed the little
man. For him, with no sunshine in his heart, all outward
sunshine was in vain. It had no ray to dispel the thick fogs
of gloom that clouded round his soul; and the gamesome
breezes which fluttered his garments and played around his
countenance, as if to provoke a smiling recognition, met
with as little of response as if they had paid courtship to
the floating iceberg, and they passed quickly by, chilled by
the hyperborean contact. The mysterious little man&mdash;contradictory
in all his aspects to the order of the day&mdash;appeared,
as he walked toward the corner of Fifth and Chestnut
streets&mdash;Justice's peculiar stand, where "Black Marias"
most do congregate, and where his honor does the honors to
that portion of society who are so unfortunate and so maladroit
as to be caught in their transgressions and to be
arrested in their sins&mdash;he appeared, we say, as he approached
this awful corner, to be most assuredly under
duress, as well as an enlistment under general affliction&mdash;a
guard of functionaries&mdash;a body-guard, though not of
honor, seemed to wait upon him&mdash;the grim little man and
the queer little man. There was a hand too&mdash;ponderous in
weight&mdash;austere in knuckle&mdash;severe in fist&mdash;resting clutchingly
upon the collar of the little man, as if to demonstrate
the fact that he only was the person to be gazed at&mdash;the incident,
the feature, the sensation of the time&mdash;though the
little man resisted not. He had yielded to his fate, sulkily,
it may be, but submissively. Pale was the little man's face&mdash;most
pale; while his hat was generally crumpled in its
circumference, and particularly smashed in the details of its
crown, having the look, abused hat, of being typical of its
owner's fortunes&mdash;an emblem, as it were, of the ups and
the downs, the stumbling-places and the pitfalls wherewith
its owner's way through life is diversified. He had a coat,
too&mdash;though this simple fact can not be alluded to as distinctly
characteristic&mdash;most men wear coats whose aspirations
go beyond the roundings of a jacket. But our little

<!-- page 10 -->

man's coat was peculiar&mdash;"itself alone," speaking of it
merely as a coat. There were two propositions&mdash;either
the coat did not belong to him, or else he did not belong to
the coat&mdash;one of these must have been true, if it were
proper to form an opinion upon the usual evidences which
go to settle our impression as to the matter of proprietorship
in coats. The fitness of things is the great constituent
of harmony in coats, as in all other matters; but here was a
palpable violation of the fitness of things, a coat being a
thing that ought always to fit, or to come as near to that condition
as the skill of the tailor, or the configuration of the
man, will allow. It may possibly be that mischance had
shrunk the individual's fair proportions, and had thus left
his garments in the lurch&mdash;the whole arrangement being
that of a very small kernel in an uncommonly-extensive
shell. It may be mentioned also, in the way of illustration,
that the buttons behind were far below their just
and proper location&mdash;that its tails trailed on the ground;
while in front the coat was buttoned almost around its
wearer's knees&mdash;not so stringently, however, as to impede
progression, for its ample circumference allowed sufficient
play to his limbs. Thus the little man was not only
grim, and queer, and sorrowful, but was also picturesque and
original. There was at least nothing like him to be seen
that day, or any other day; and, as he walked, marvellous
people held up their hands and wondered&mdash;curious people
rubbed their eyes and stared&mdash;sagacious people shook their
wise heads in disapproval; and dubious people, when they
heard of it, were inclined to the opinion that it must be a
mistake altogether, and "a no such thing." A boy admiringly
observed, that it was his impression that "there was
a good deal of coat with a very small allowance of man,"
like his grandmother's pies, which, according to his report,
were more abundantly endowed with crust than gifted with
apples; as if the merit of a pie did not consist mainly in its
enclosures. To confess the truth, it might as well be candidly

<!-- page 11 -->

granted at once, that but for the impediment of having
his arms in the sleeves, the little man might have turned
round in his coat, without putting his coat to the inconvenience
of turning round with him.</p>

<p>The case&mdash;we do not mean the coat, but the case, in general
and inclusive&mdash;offered another striking peculiarity. In
addition to the somewhat dilapidated pair which already
adorned his pedal extremities, the little man, or Mr. Peter
Faber&mdash;for such was the appellation in which this little
man rejoiced, when he did happen to rejoice&mdash;for no one
ever was lucky enough to catch him at it&mdash;Mr. Peter Faber
carried another pair of boots along with him&mdash;one in each
hand&mdash;as if he had used precaution against being sent on a
bootless errand, and took the field like artillery, supplied
with extra wheels. But it was not that Mr. Peter Faber had
feloniously appropriated these boots, as ill-advised persons
might be induced to suppose. But each man has his idiosyncrasy&mdash;his
peculiarities&mdash;some trait which, by imperceptible
advances, results at last in being the master-passion,
consuming all the rest; and boots&mdash;an almost insane love
of boots&mdash;stood in this important relation to Mr. Peter Faber.
In happier days, when the sun of prosperity beamed
brightly on him, full of warmth and cheeriness, Peter Faber
had a whole closet full of boots, and a top-shelf full of
blacking&mdash;in boxes and in bottles&mdash;solid blacking, and
that which is diluted; and Peter Faber's leisure hours
were passed in polishing these boots, in admiring these
boots, and in trying on these boots. Peter knew, sadly
enough, that he could not be regarded as a handsome man&mdash;that
neither his face nor his form was calculated to
attract attention as he passed along; but his foot was undeniably
neat&mdash;both his feet were&mdash;and his affection for himself
came to a concentration at that point.</p>

<p>Some men there are who value themselves upon one
quality&mdash;others may be discovered who flatter themselves
on the possession of another quality&mdash;each of us is a sort

<!-- page 12 -->

of heathen temple, with its peculiar idol for our secret worship.
There are those who pay adoration to their hair.
Whiskers, too, have votaries. People are to be met with
who attitudinize with their fingers, from a belief that these
manual appendages are worthy to be admired, because they
are white, or chance to be of diminutive order. Many eyes
have double duty to perform, that we may be induced to mark
their languishing softness or to note their sparkling brilliancy.
To smile is often a laborious occupation to those who fancy
they are displayed to advantage in that species of physiognomical
exercise; and there are persons of the tragic style,
who practise frowning severity in the mirrors, that they may
"look awfully" at times. Softnesses of this kind are innumerable,
rendering us the most ridiculous when most we
wish to please. The strongest have such folly; and the
weak point in Peter Faber's character lay in his foot. Men
there are who will make puns, and are yet permitted to live.
Peter Faber cherished boots, and became the persecuted of
society! Justice is blind.</p>

<p>On the previous night, in the very hours of quietness and
repose, there came a strange noise of rattling and bumping
at the front door of the respectable house of the respectable
family of the Sniggses&mdash;people by no means disposed to turbulence
themselves, or inclined to tolerate turbulence in others.
It so happened, indeed, on this memorable occasion,
that Sniggs himself was absent from the city; and the rest
of the family were nervous after dark, because his valor had
temporarily been withdrawn from their protection. Still,
however, the fearful din continued, to the complete and terrified
awakening of the innocent Sniggses from the refreshment
of balmy slumber. And such a turmoil&mdash;such hurrying
to and fro, under the appalling influence of nocturnal alarm.
Betsy, the maid-of-all-work, crept in terror to the chamber
of the maternal Mrs. Sniggs. Betsy first heard the noise
and thought it "washing-day;" but discovering her mistake,
Betsy aroused the matron with the somewhat indefinite news,

<!-- page 13 -->

though rather fearful announcement, that "they are breaking
in!"&mdash;the intelligence, perhaps, being the more horrible because
of its vagueness, it being left to the excited imagination
to determine who "they" were. Then came little Tommy
Sniggs, shivering with cold and fear, while he looked like a
sheeted ghost in the whiteness of his nocturnal habiliments.
Tommy and Betsy crawled under the bed, that they might
lie hid in safety. Nor were Mary, and Sally, and Prudence,
and Patience, slow in their approach; and they distributed
themselves within the bed and beneath, as terror chanced to
suggest. Never before had the Sniggs family been stowed
away with such compactness&mdash;never before had there been
such trembling and shaking within the precincts of that staid
and sober mansion.</p>

<p>"There it goes again!" shivered Mrs. Sniggs, from beneath
the blankets.</p>

<p>"They're most through the door!" quivered Betsy, under
the bed.</p>

<p>"They'll take all our money!" whimpered Prudence.</p>

<p>"And all our lives, too!" groaned Patience.</p>

<p>"And the spoons besides!" shrieked Mary, who was acting
in the capacity of housekeeper for that particular week.</p>

<p>"Pa!" screamed Tommy, under the usual impression of
the juveniles, that, as "pa" corrects them, he is fully competent
to the correction of all the other evils that present themselves
under the sun.</p>

<p>"Ma!" ejaculated the others, seeking rather for comfort
and consolation, than for fiercer methods of relief. But neither
"pa" nor "ma" seemed to have an exorcising effect upon
the mysterious bumpings, and bangings, and pantings, and
ejaculations, at the front door.</p>

<p>In the process of time, however, becoming a little familiarized
to the disturbance, Mrs. Sniggs slowly raised the
window, and put forth her nightcapped head, it having been
suggested that by possibility it might be a noise emanating
from Mr. Sniggs, or "pa" himself, returning unexpectedly.</p>

<!-- page 14 -->

<p>"Who's there?" said Mrs. Sniggs.</p>

<p>"Boots!" was the sepulchral reply.</p>

<p>"Is it you, dear&mdash;you, Sniggs?"</p>

<p>"If you mean 'me' by saying 'you,' it is me&mdash;but I'm not
'dear'&mdash;boots is 'dear'&mdash;Sniggs, did you say? Who's
Sniggs? If he is an able-bodied man, send him down here
to bear a hand, will you!" and another crash renewed the
terrors of the second story, which sought vent in such loud
and repeated shrieks, that even the watchman himself was
awakened, and judiciously halting at the distance of half a
square, he made his reconnaisance with true military caution,
concluding with an inquiry as to what was the matter,
that he might know exactly how to regulate his approaches
to the seat of war. An idea had entered his mind, that perhaps
a ghost was at the bottom of all this uproar; and though
perhaps as little afraid of mere flesh and blood as most people
of his vocation, he had no fondness for taking spectres by
the collar, or for springing his rattle at the heels of a goblin,
holding it&mdash;the principle, and not the ghost&mdash;as a maxim
that, if such folks pay no taxes and are not allowed to vote, they
are not entitled to the luxury of an arrest, for the ordinances
of the city do not apply to them.</p>

<p>"Even if it is not a ghost nor a sperrit&mdash;and I'm not very
fond of any sort of sperrits but them that comes in bottles,"
said he, having now approached near enough to hear the
knocking, and to see a dark object in motion at the top of
Mr. Sniggs's steps&mdash;"perhaps it's something out of the
menagerie or the museum&mdash;something that bites or something
that hooks; and I can not aff'ord to have my precious
corporation used for the benefit of the city's corporation.
The wages is too small for a man to have himself killed into
the bargain."</p>

<p>"But maybe it's a bird!" continued he, as he caught
a glimpse of Peter's coat-tail fluttering in the wind&mdash;"sho-o-o-o!"</p>

<p>But no regard being paid to the cry, which settled the

<!-- page 15 -->

point that there was no bird in the case&mdash;"sho-o-o!" being
a part of bird language, and only comprehensible by the
feathered race&mdash;the watchman slowly advanced, until he
saw that the mysterious being was a man&mdash;a little man&mdash;apparently
levelling a blunderbuss and pulling at the trigger.</p>

<p>"Who said shoe, when it's boot?" inquired the unknown
figure, still seemingly with a gun at its shoulder, and turning
round so that the muzzle appeared to point dangerously at
the intruder.</p>

<p>"Hallo! don't shoot! maybe it will go off!" cried the
watch, as he ducked and dived to confuse the aim and to avoid
the anticipated bullet.</p>

<p>"Don't shute! I know it don't shute&mdash;that's what I want
it to do&mdash;I'm trying to make it shute with all my ten fingers,"
was the panting reply, as the apparently threatening muzzle
was lowered for an instant and raised again&mdash;"and as for its
going off, that's easy done. What I want, is to make it
go on."</p>

<p>Luckily for Charley's comfort, he now discovered that the
supposed blunderbuss was Peter Faber's leg; and that the
little man had it levelled like a gun, in the vain attempt to
pull a Wellington boot over that which already encased his
foot. He sighed and tugged, and sighed and tugged again.
The effort was bootless. He could not, to use his own words,
make it "shute." The first pair, which already occupied the
premises, would not be prevailed upon to admit of interlopers,
and Peter's pulling and hauling were in vain.</p>

<p>It was the banging of Peter's back against the front door
of Mrs. Sniggs's mansion that had so alarmed the family;
and now as he talked, he hopped across the pavement, still
tugging at the boot, and took his place upon the fire-plug.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!&mdash;baint it hot!" said Peter. "Drat these boots!
they've been eating green presimmings. I guess their
mouths are all drawed up, just as if they wanted to whistle
'Hail Kerlumby.' They did fit like nothing when I tried
'em on this morning; but now I might as well pull at the

<!-- page 16 -->

door-handle and try to poke my foot through the keyhole.
My feet couldn't have growed so much in a single night, or
else my stockings would have been tore; and I'm sure these
are my own legs and nobody else's, because they are as short
as ever and as bandy. Besides, I know it's me by the patches
on my knees. That's the way I always tell."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure," inquired the watch, "that you didn't
get swopped as you came up the street? You've got boot,
somehow or other. But come, now," added he authoritatively,
and putting on the dignity that belongs to his station,
"quit being redickalis, and tell us what's the meaning of sich
goin's on in a white man, who ought to be a credit to his
fetching up. If you're a gentleman's son, always be genteel,
and never cut up shindies, or indulge in didoes. What are
you doing with them 'are boots? That's the question, Mr.
Speaker."</p>

<p>"Doing with my boots? What could I do without my
boots, watchy?" added Peter, in tones of the deepest solemnity,
as he laid his boots upon his lap and smoothed them
down with every token of affection. "Watchy, though you
are a watchy, you've got a heart with the sensibilities in it&mdash;nothing
of the brickbat about you, is there, watchy? If
you are ugly to look at, it's not your fault, and it's not your
fault that you're a watchy. I can see with half an eye that
you're a man with feelings; and you know as well as I do
that we must have something to love in this world&mdash;you
love your rattle&mdash;I love my boots&mdash;better nor they love me,
I'm afraid," and Peter grew plaintive.</p>

<p>The watchman, however, shook his head with an expression
of "duberousness," which, like the celebrated nod of
Lord Burleigh, seemed to signify a great deal relative to the
thoughts existing within the head that was thus shaken. It
vibrated, as it were, between opinions, oscillating to the right,
under the idea that Peter Faber was insane from moral
causes, and pendulating to the left with the impression that

<!-- page 17 -->

he was queer, perchance, from causes which come upon the
table of liquid measure.</p>

<p>Peter's thoughts, however, were too intent upon the work
he had in hand and desired to get on foot, to pay attention
to any other insinuation than that of trying to insinuate his
toes into the calfskin. Sarcastic glances and nods of distrust
were thrown away upon him. He asked, no other solace
than that of bringing his sole in contact with the sole of his
new boot. On this his soul was intent.</p>

<p>"It's not a very genteel expression, I know," said the nocturnal
guardian, "and it may seem to be rather a personal
insinivation, though I only ask it in a professional way, and
not because I want to know as a private citizen&mdash;no, it's in
my public campacity, that I think you've been drinking&mdash;I
think so as a watchman, not as David Dumpy. Isn't you a
leetle corned?"</p>

<p>"Corned! No&mdash;look at my foot&mdash;nor bunioned either,"
replied Peter, as he commenced another series of tugging at
the straps; and with a look of suspicion, he added: "That
'tarnal bootman must have changed 'em. He's guv me
some baby's boots. But never mind&mdash;boots was made to
go on, and go on they must, if I break my back a driving
into 'em. Hurra!" shrieked our hero, "bring on your wild
cats!"</p>

<p>With this exclamation&mdash;which amounts with those who
use it, to a determination to do or die&mdash;Peter screwed up
his visage and his courage to what may be truly denominated
"the terrible <i>feet</i>," and put forth his whole strength. Every
nerve was strained to its utmost tension; the tug was tremendous;
but alas! C&aelig;sar was punctured as full of holes as
a cullender, by those whom he regarded as his best friends;
many others have been stuck in a vital part by those who
were their intimate cronies; and how could Peter Faber
hope to escape the treachery by which all great men are begirt?
When exerting the utmost of his physical strength,
the traitorous straps gave way. Two simultaneous cracks

<!-- page 18 -->

were heard; a pair of heels, describing a short curve, flashed
through the air, and Peter, with the rapidity of lightnings
turned a series of backward somersets from the fire-plug, and
went whizzing like a wheel across the street. Now the half-donned
boot appeared uppermost, and again his head followed
his heels, as if for very rage he was trying to bite the
hinder part of his shins, or sought to hide his mortification at
his failure, not only by swallowing his boots, but likewise by
gobbling up his whole body.</p>

<p>"Why, bless us, Boots!" said the Charley, following him
like a boy beating a hoop, "this is what I call rewarsing the
order of natur. You travel backerds, and you stop on your
noddle. I thought you was trying to go clean through the
mud into the middle of next week. An't you most knocked
into a cocked hat?"</p>

<p>"Cocked fiddlesticks!" muttered Peter. "Turn us right
side up, with care. That's right&mdash;cocked hat, indeed! when
you can see with half an eye, if you've got as much, it's my
boots vot vont go on. A steam-engine&mdash;forty horse power&mdash;couldn't
pull 'em on, if your foot was a thimble and your
legs a knitting-needle. Don't you see it was the straps as
broke? Not a good watchy!" continued Peter, as he dashed
the boots on the pavement, and made a vain attempt to dance
on them, and "tread on haughty Spain."</p>

<p>"Well, now, I think I am a good watchy; for I've been
watching you and your boots for some time."</p>

<p>"What's a man, if he a'n't got handsome boots; and what's
the use of handsome boots, if he a'n't got 'em on? As the
English gineral said, what's beauty without bootee, and what's
bootee without beauty? Look at them 'are articles&mdash;fust I
bought 'em, and then I black'd 'em, and now they turn agin
me, and bite their best friend, like a wiper. Don't they look
as if they ought to be ashamed!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I rather think they do look mean enough."</p>

<p>"Who cares what you think? Have you got a bootjack

<!-- page 19 -->

in your pocket?&mdash;no, not a bootjack&mdash;I want a pair of them
'are hook-em-sniveys, vot they uses in the shops. I don't
want a pull-offer; I want a pair of pull-oners."</p>

<p>"If you will walk with me, I'll find you a pair of hook-em-sniveys
in less than no time."</p>

<p>"If you will, I'll go; because I must get my boots on
somehow, and hook-em-sniveys will do it if anything will.
There's no fun in boots what won't go on; you can't make
anything of 'em except old clothes-bags and letter-boxes, and
I a'n't got much use for articles of the sort&mdash;seeing as how
clothes and letters are scarce with me."</p>

<p>"Can't you use them for book-keeping by double-entry?
That's the way I do. I put all my cash into one old
boot, and all my receipts into the other. That's scientific
double-entry simplified&mdash;old slippers is the Italian
method."</p>

<p>"No, I can't. I does business on the fork-out system. I
don't save up, only for boots; and as soon as I gets any money,
I speculates right off in something to eat, and lives upon the
principal."</p>

<p>Peter gathered up his boots, and half reclining upon the
watchman, wended his way to the common receptacle, where,
after discovering the trick played upon him, and finding that
the "hook-em-sniveys" were not forthcoming, he shared his
wrath between the boots which had originally betrayed him,
and the individual who had consequently betrayed him. At
length,</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Sweet sleep, the wounded bosom healing,"</p>

</div>

restored Peter to himself and that just estimate of the fitness
of things, which teaches that it is not easy&mdash;even for a man
who is as sober as a powder-horn&mdash;to pull a pair of long
boots over another pair, particularly if the latter happen to
be wet and muddy. Convinced of this important truth,
Peter put his boots under his arm, and departed to get the

<!-- page 20 -->

straps repaired, and try the efficacy of "hook-em-sniveys"
where the law could not interfere.</p>

<p>And such was the close of this remarkable episode in the
life of the grim little man and the queer little man, whose
monomania had boots for its object.</p>

<p>THE MAN THAT DANCED THE POLKA</p>

<p class="small">OR, THE OAK AND THE VIOLET.</p>

</div>

<p>HE danced the polka!</p>

<p>And here, if we were addicted to epigrammatic brevity,
our narrative might close, with the short and simple enunciation
of a fact which involves the moral of Lankley Towers&mdash;all,
perhaps, that entitles him to special attention as a
subject of biography.</p>

<p><i>He danced the polka!!</i></p>

<p>We like this condensation, winding up the virtues of a
man, Napoleon-like, into that compactness of parcel which
seems to contain much more than volumes. There is a classic
nudity about it, scorning the tinsel of pretence; and
whether inscribed upon the rolls of fame, or carved upon a
tombstone, what could be more likely to arrest attention or
to be long remembered, than&mdash;</p>

<p>HE DANCED THE POLKA!!!</p>

<p>The effect is obvious. As the ages pass along, there
would be pausing on the march, and pondering by the way.
Successive centuries must stop&mdash;here, over Lankley's "sad
remainders"&mdash;to wonder at the epitaph. Why was it that
he danced the polka?&mdash;how was it that he danced the
polka?&mdash;what is the polka, and who was Lankley? Our
era would gain an immortality.</p>

<p>Antiquarian research might show that many danced the
polka, at the period referred to; and that an ability to perform
the feat was a passport through the world of social life;
but nicer observation might detect, that while the many
danced the polka, in the thoughtlessness of mere muscular
agitation, wiggling hither and waggling thither, without ulterior

<!-- page 22 -->

design, and reversing heel and toe, as Korponay prescribes,
with no originality of mind, Lankley Towers availed
himself of the polka as an aid to enterprise. To him, the
polka was a stratagem&mdash;a conspiracy&mdash;a <i>coup d'etat</i>. His
polka had a purpose.</p>

<p>Some men succeed by plodding industry&mdash;there are others
who make their way, through force of intellect&mdash;the
whisker and mustache have oft worked wonders; but it was
left for Lankley Towers to accomplish all he wished by "a
wise and masterly" recourse to the polka. He neither
crawled, nor crept, nor rushed, up to the heights of fortune.
He danced up, to tunes of Strauss and Jullien, as the army
of Italy was animated to the crossing of the Alps by the
inspiring strains of the <i>Marseillaise</i>.</p>

<p>Not that there was any peculiar physical adaptation in
Lankley Towers, leading to brilliant achievements as a
carpet knight. Though a gentleman, in the most extended
sense of the term&mdash;longitudinally, few could measure more
in feet and inches&mdash;yet he had little pretension to beauty in
other respects. He was a man, no doubt, of elevated views,
capable of lighting his cigar at the street lamp, and of looking
into the windows of the second story. No inquiries
could be requisite on any occasion, to ascertain if Mr. Lankley
Towers were present; and, in a crowd, he, better than
other people, might discover exactly what was the matter.
Others may brag of a long line of ancestors&mdash;Lankley could
boast of being a long line in himself. But he discovered at
last, when the cash his father bequeathed to him had melted
from his grasp&mdash;how incidents of that sort sharpen the philosophy&mdash;that
a man requires some degree of latitude to
live, however upright may be his intentions, and however
erect his bearing. And so&mdash;</p>

<p>He danced the polka.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lankley Towers," observed his uncle Tobias, when
Lankley was in process of paying a domiciliary visit to the

<!-- page 23 -->

uncle aforesaid, in the vain hope of raising the wind&mdash;his
uncle, on this fiscal occasion, like a prudent man, as he was,
volunteering a monitory check, in the way of advice, instead
of a monetary check, in the way of the bank, as Lankley
desired&mdash;"Lankley Towers, I can not afford to keep you
in wind any longer&mdash;you are too long in this respect
already, and I am getting short. I'm nearly blown myself,
by this tightness in the money-market, which has given
me a sympathetic constriction in the region of the chest.
Financially speaking, I've got the asthma."</p>

<p>"But, uncle, I want some cash so bad."</p>

<p>"To be sure&mdash;to want money is always bad; and that is
one of the reasons why I won't lend. If you didn't want it
so bad, there might be some chance of getting it back. But
when people want money bad, as you call it, the whole affair
becomes bad. Why don't you do something for yourself?"</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" asked Lankley, mournfully. "I've
borrowed from everybody, and don't know how to do anything
else."</p>

<p>"Can't you get a situation as a lighthouse? They might
whitewash you up, and hang a lamp on your hat&mdash;or there's
Mr. Morse and his magnetic telegraph&mdash;how would you
like to be one of the posts, with a wire to your head?"</p>

<p>"Uncle," replied Lankley, in accents of reproach, "don't
talk ironically about wires to a fellow's head; and never
speak disrespectfully of nature's doings, in regard to the
article of legs. If you won't lend me any money, pray have
respect for my feelings. I'm sensitive about the legs, especially
when my pockets are empty. I never twitted you,
uncle, because your legs are mere abridgments of works
upon the understanding."</p>

<p>"Well, well; I only desired that you should make yourself
useful in one way or in another; and such legs as yours
are as good a method of getting along, as any I could think
of. If you were to lie down they would make a tolerable
railroad. Always trust to your legs, Lankley, since you

<!-- page 24 -->

have been so extensively favored in this respect. It is more
than probable your genius lies in that extraordinary locomotive
apparatus&mdash;you may as well trust to your legs now&mdash;there's
no money hereabouts&mdash;nothing over to-day, unless it
be done over."</p>

<p>"Trust to my legs!" repeated Lankley, as he walked
away at the utmost compass of his stride, so that people
looked after him in admiration, as if the "shears" from the
navy-yard, or the machinery for raising blocks at the Girard
college, had wandered forth to take a walk; "trust to my
legs!&mdash;many a true word may be spoken in jest&mdash;but how
to render my legs available? Creditors are troublesome;
and there is Texas; but Texas is annexed. Oregon!&mdash;bother
enough there about parallels, without me and my
legs. And besides, what's the use of changing the scene,
when the performance will be all the same? If I can't borrow
here, how can I borrow anywhere else?"</p>

<p>"Legs!" and Lankley Towers stood still in silent meditation.</p>

<p>In these times of excitement, the very children returning
from school will dance the polka&mdash;with arms a-kimbo, and
with vibrating heads, they skip along the street, singing,
"<i>la, la, riddle, tiddle, right tum. looral&mdash;right tum, dight
tum, tooral, looral,</i>" and looking coquettishly, first over one
shoulder and then over the other, as they twist themselves
into every variety of grotesque form. The polka is everywhere;
in highways and in byways; and no wonder that it
jostled Lankley Towers, in the midst of his disconsolate reflections.
Lankley Towers had himself&mdash;and who had not?&mdash;shared
in the general enthusiasm; and knew somewhat
of the mystic dance of the nineteenth century. The instinct
of discipline prevailed involuntarily.</p>

<p>"Right dum, dight tum&mdash;tooral, looral," sang Lankley
Towers, casting himself rapidly into a series of attitudes.
The people laughed, and the little dogs barked.</p>

<p>But with Lankley it was a moment of inspiration. The

<!-- page 25 -->

flint and steel, dissevered, each lie in icy coldness. No
flash of fire appears; and thus may our genius slumber, like
the flint or like the steel, until some happy contact wakes
the sheeted flame. A falling pippin&mdash;or was it the dandy-gray-russet?&mdash;hit
Newton on the head, and aroused him to
a knowledge of nature's choicest secrets&mdash;a knock, we doubt
not, that led to the after scourging of the schools, that sluggish
intellect might be similarly enlivened. Why not throw
apples now at pupils' heads?&mdash;for just such an apple to the
head of Lankley Towers, was the accidental polka of the
street striking upon his uncle's parting words&mdash;"Trust to
your legs."</p>

<p>"I will," said Lankley; and, with a firm resolve, he
hastened home, to dress for a polka party, at Muscovado's.</p>

<p>It was a brilliant scene&mdash;beauty was there&mdash;whisker, imperial,
mustache, goatee&mdash;all thronged at Muscovado's. But
Lankley heeded not&mdash;looming over all, his eyes were ever
downward bent&mdash;for Celestina Muscovado&mdash;the heiress to
more thousands than our arithmetic dare calculate&mdash;was the
antipodes of Lankley&mdash;a condensation of all excellence;
and it was she that Lankley sought.</p>

<p>Relatively, Celestina Muscovado was like the church,
while Lankley spired and steepled at her side&mdash;one might
almost hear the bells a ringing in his head; and as you
travelled by, it was no more than natural to give an upward
glance, to see the clock and learn the time of day. When
"timorous accent and dire yell," proclaimed a conflagration,
it was common to call up to Lankley to ask in what direction
lay the fire. But Miss Celestina Muscovado, though a
person of considerable weight in the world, took a different
direction, preferring breadth to altitude; and she became
the beau ideal of the "roly-poly" style of feminine loveliness.
No wonder, then, she looked with favor upon Lankley
Towers&mdash;no wonder, then, he took the hint.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is no grace or beauty," whispered he, "in these

<!-- page 26 -->

Patagonian girls&mdash;grenadiers&mdash;fit only to reach things from
a top-shelf."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, Mr. Towers," blushingly said Miss Celestina
Muscovado, "a lady may be too tall."</p>

<p>"A great deal too tall, Miss Muscovado&mdash;horrid tall, too
many of them. I never could admire this wire-drawn attenuation
in a woman. Give me the stature of a sylph&mdash;a
fairy&mdash;rounded into grace and comfort&mdash;divinely human&mdash;humanly
divine."</p>

<p>"Certainly," simpered Celestina Muscovado; "a lady may
be too meager, as well as too tall."</p>

<p>"Both are common faults; and with my susceptibility to
the truly beautiful&mdash;ah, Miss Muscovado, my susceptibility&mdash;my
capacity to love and to admire&mdash;is intense&mdash;it's awful&mdash;with
my susceptibility, then, I seldom go out into the
world&mdash;it shocks me so&mdash;I am happy only at friend Muscovado's.
Here only is my soul content."</p>

<p>"Fie, Mr. Lankley Towers! A'n't you 'shamed?" and
Miss Celestina Muscovado tapped him with her fan.</p>

<p>Lankley had touched the proper chord. The response
was as he wished; and, like the celebrated Mr. Brown, it
was not in his nature to "give it up so." He proceeded
upon the Brunonian theory of perseverance; and displayed
his knowledge of human nature by proving a practical acquaintance
with the fact that, next to ourselves, we admire
and love the opposite to ourselves.</p>

<p>"Such pigmy little fellows!" murmured Towers, in disdain,
drawing up to such a height that Miss Celestina Muscovado
could scarcely see his countenance. "Most men are
so diminutive now-a-days&mdash;nothing heroic or magnificent
about them. If there's anything I do despise, it is these
little men."</p>

<p>"They ought always to be tall&mdash;I doat on a tall gentleman,"
said Miss Muscovado, impulsively, but checking herself
with bewitching confusion.</p>

<p>"Such a lovely contrast it makes, Miss Muscovado&mdash;the

<!-- page 27 -->

lordly and majestic oak&mdash;man&mdash;reaching almost to the
skies; and the modest violet&mdash;woman&mdash;finding peace, happiness,
and joy, beneath his shelter and protection. But
now, woman is the oak; and man is a saucy little 'johnny
jump-up' at her feet. There is a very small quantity of the
true poetics to be met with in these degenerate days, Miss
Muscovado;" and Lankley looked down, as it were, from
the garret-window of his elevation, upon Miss Muscovado
in the "airey."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Towers!"</p>

<p>"Ah, Miss Celestina!"</p>

<p>What a moment&mdash;no "tirkle" doves were ever happier.
Let us not interrupt a silence so eloquent.</p>

<p>"Just observe, Miss Muscovado," at length whispered
Lankley, recovering from the abstraction, with a sigh of
tenderness; "look at those little men and monstrous women
dancing in the polka. Where, where, I ask you, in this gay
assemblage, do we behold a picture of what should be?&mdash;where
is the oak, and where the violet?"</p>

<p>"Not there&mdash;not there!" and Miss Celestina Muscovado
buried the light of her countenance in the most gossamer of
all pocket-handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>Lankley Towers felt convinced that his genius had been
developed, and that it must prevail.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The oak and the violet were seen dancing together at intervals
throughout the evening; and when they were not
dancing, they retired into the recesses of a window, engaged
in earnest discoursings, which it is not for us to betray to
the gossiping ear of the public. Their conduct, however, did
not escape from observation, for Miss Celestina Muscovado
was an envied prize.</p>

<p>"I say, Ned, do you see," remarked a very little dandy,
with more of whisker to his countenance than his physical
frame appeared calculated to sustain&mdash;"do you see how that
lightning-rod fellow, Lankley Towers, is flirting with Celestina?&mdash;'bominable,

<!-- page 28 -->

isn't it?&mdash;such an ugly rascal, too&mdash;she
won't listen to me at all. What taste!&mdash;I'll try a little more
chicken salad."</p>

<p>"When I asked her to dance, she said she was engaged&mdash;engaged
every set. I've half a mind to affront him; and I
will, after I have some terrapin&mdash;there's terrapin, I hope&mdash;and
a glass or two of champagne," observed Ned.</p>

<p>"Lankley Towers is after the spoons," growled another
of the great rebuffed, who being after the "spoons" himself,
was, therefore, a good judge of motive in the case; "and if
there's any whiskey-punch&mdash;punch sooths one's feelings so&mdash;I'll
go and tell old Muscovado that fortune-hunters are
about."</p>

<p>"He knows that already," muttered somebody else, who
had been rejected on the same score by the Muscovado family;
and he consoled himself with a little brandy and water,
as the best tonic in his peculiar emergency. "What will you
get by telling? Better make a bargain with Lankley Towers,
and help him off with Celestina, for a per-centage on the
profits of the speculation."</p>

<p>Thus all was excitement at Muscovado's polka party.
Everybody about the room was talking of Lankley Towers's
unblushing impudence in thus openly aspiring to the hand
of Miss Celestina Muscovado; and when they danced, everybody
scrambled to witness the performance and to sneer at
the happy man. The little dandy, in his ocean of whisker,
stood in gloom, with folded arms, having a sensation which
is peculiar in such cases, and is known in surgery as the dislocation
of the nose. Ned actually jumped upon a waiter to
obtain a better view of that which wrung his heart; while
old Muscovado shook his head in vain. The oak and the
violet had a harmony that nothing could derange. The sneers
of the gentlemen at Lankley Towers, and the tittering of the
ladies at Celestina Muscovado, fell harmlessly around that
happy pair.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 29 -->

<p>"Tell Celestina&mdash;Miss Muscovado"&mdash;for the old gentleman
piqued himself upon preserving the dignities and proprieties
before the servants&mdash;we should like to see you slap
him on the back and call him "Bob," as you do some people&mdash;"tell
my daughter that breakfast waits," said paternity,
as it sat revolving the costs and meditating on the annoyances
of the preceding night.</p>

<p>But Miss Muscovado, as Miss Muscovado, was no longer
in existence. Instead of retiring to her chamber at the conclusion
of the polka party, she had merely stolen up stairs for
an apparel suitable to the occasion, and had escaped to somebody
else's cab, where our tall friend awaited her arrival;
and in a very brief space of time she had been metamorphosed
into Mrs. Lankley Towers, thus realizing the allegory
of the oak and the violet. Muscovado, notwithstanding the
sweetness of his name, became greatly acidulated&mdash;sharp to
a degree&mdash;he jumped about the room and dashed his wig
into the fire&mdash;he whirled a teapot through the looking-glass.
He swore he never could, and never would, and never should,
forgive his short daughter with that endless husband; but,
alas, he had no daughter but Mrs. Lankley Towers, and who
else could supervise the house?</p>

<p>Before many months had elapsed, old Muscovado, at his
own fireside, was stumbling over a pair of illimitable legs,
which had gained fame and fortune for their owner, and had
enabled him to "marry in" and "hang up his hat" in the
quietude of domestic felicity. Not a care wrinkled the happy
front of the fortunate possessor of these far-reaching limbs.
They were needed no longer&mdash;if they could be longer&mdash;to
carry him about to borrow from his friends; for Muscovado
footed all the bills, and the proprietor thereof took upon himself
no heed either of to-day or to-morrow. Who was this
lucky one, do you ask?&mdash;why, who but he that took his
uncle's advice and "trusted to his legs?"&mdash;who could it
be but&mdash;</p>

<p>PERRY WINKLE:</p>

<p>MR. PERRY WINKLE has one advantage&mdash;though it is
rather of a melancholy description&mdash;over the rest of the
world; and his superiority in this respect, as there are but
few who can claim to be largely distinguished from the mass
of men by a feature which may be called decidedly their own,
entitles him to be looked upon as a hero, and to have things
written about him. Perry Winkle does not follow in the
beaten track, like a horse in a mill. He has an idea or two
completely to himself; and he diverges from the macadamized
ways of other people, to make a detour through the grass.
This singularity, even if it be presumed that, with the unconsciousness
which is an attribute to genius, he is not aware
of the fact, must be regarded as a great happiness in Perry
Winkle. It may chance to send him down embalmed to
future ages; and it can not be otherwise than a source of
comfort to departed Perry Winkles, to have the name remembered
when its owner is gone. The consideration is one
for which multitudes freely render up their lives, often without
obtaining it; and a single posthumous puff from the tin
trumpet of chubby-cheeked fame, is thought to be a solid
equivalent for any amount of sacrifice. To Perry Winkle,
however, it will be an involuntary offering. He seeks not
the bubble reputation, and it is probable that his indifference
on this score will secure to him a prize for which others toil
in vain.</p>

<p>But it must be confessed, that Perry Winkle's claim to
notice is rather moral and metaphysical, than of that active

<!-- page 31 -->

nature which is the more easily recognised. He has not
been in battles, and he never so much as tried to kill people;
he would scarcely have been distinguished as a soldier. A
gun, particularly when the muzzle is grinning toward his
person, excites no pleasurable emotions in Perry Winkle.
He has an aversion to cold steel, and finds no music in the
report of firearms.</p>

<p>What, then, is this strange characteristic which is so much
enlarged upon, as rendering Perry Winkle a person in whose
presence we should instinctively and respectfully take off our
hats? If Perry Winkle is notable mainly for doing nothing,
what did he do to achieve his greatness?</p>

<p>Perry Winkle <i>thinks</i>. He ruminates, cogitates, meditates,
contemplates, speculates, hesitates, and vegetates. Perry
muses. There are nine muses already; but Perry increases
the number to ten.</p>

<p>Doing is one thing; and, as the world is constituted, doing
is a useful thing enough in its way. It would be improper
to speak of it in terms of disparagement. We often find it
obligatory to be doing. But yet, this "to do"&mdash;the "greatest
to do" that can possibly occur&mdash;what is it in qualities of
the true sublime, compared to that unseen and mysterious
process which is known as thinking? There is force in
thinking.</p>

<p>Some people think all the hair off their heads. Shakspeare
and Julius C&aelig;sar were bald, as if the brain, like physical labor,
works better without its jacket, and is never free in its
energies and unembarrassed in its operations until it strips
to the task. But without fully developing this idea, which
no doubt will at some future day lead to important results,
as regards the intellectual constitution of man, let it now be
remarked, that it is wrong to reprove people for seeming to
do nothing. There may be much of wisdom in the twiddling
of thumbs. Who knows what a vast amount of thought may
be performed when the individual appears only to whittle a
stick?&mdash;It was so with Perry Winkle. He is always thinking,

<!-- page 32 -->

and is remarkable, among other remarkabilities, for the
very little he can contrive to do, which augurs greatness with
the certainty of a gimlet, though citizens of the more worldly
cast regard it as a bore.</p>

<p>And though Perry Winkle may in strictness be said to
think for himself, he is not of an exclusive nature, and frequently
thinks for other people, without standing on ceremony,
or waiting to be asked; and it is his constitutional
point, as well as his characteristic trait, never to anticipate
anything but disaster. In this way, though he can not be
spoken of as exempt from calamity, he certainly does contrive
to escape from the disappointments which cast a shadow
over the lives of the most fortunate. Contrary to the practices
of a sanguine people, mischance with Perry is the rule,
while success forms the exception; and his predictions are
so often verified by the result&mdash;he made a great hit at the
time "morus multicaulis" was in fashion&mdash;that he almost
regards himself, to this extent at least, as gifted with a species
of second-sight, and as nearly equal to the "seventh son
of a seventh son," which he would doubtless have been, if
his father and himself could each have had six elder brothers.
It is indeed true that his forebodings are precisely the same
in all cases. Whatever he attempts, or whatever other folks
may chance to do, Mr. Perry Winkle anticipates the worst;
and his sagacity is more frequently vindicated by the event
than is usual with those who seek to peer into futurity.
When enterprises are embarked in, Perry Winkle indicates
a shipwreck. When neighbors are sick, Perry Winkle is
beforehand with the doctor in assurances that they can not
recover; and when the vessel is on the breakers, or the
voice of mourning is heard, can any one deny that Perry
Winkle was right? When he was the smallest slip of a boy,
did he not say he was sure the rope of a swing would break;
and did it not break, to the essential damage of Perry's
bones?&mdash;didn't he know it would be so? How often has he
shrieked to children as they climbed the fence or projected

<!-- page 33 -->

themselves from windows, that they would surely fall; and
did they not fall as soon as the startling announcement reached
their ears? No wonder Perry Winkle looks upon himself
as one as prophetically gifted as the famed Cassandra; and,
happier than the croaking Trojan lady, he is presumed to
derive a certain degree of pleasure from the fulfilment of his
melancholy vocation.</p>

<p>Others, perhaps, may find it difficult to realize Perry Winkle's
satisfactions; but they are real to him, even if incomprehensible
to them. For instance&mdash;when the boat was
capsized by a flaw of wind, and the cold and dripping Perry
Winkle was fished up inanimate from the bottom of the river,
ordinary individuals in his extremity, would have been quite
unable to extract agreeable emotions from such a catastrophe.
Still less could they imagine how joy was to be deduced
from it, when the humane but unskilful rescue, hoisted the
water-logged Perry Winkle up by the heels, as if he were to
be put to dry, like a herring. Nor would they have been a
whit the more successful in ascertaining the comfort of it,
when the exhausted man was rolled about bumpingly, upon
a barrel, to wake up by rude knockings any remnant of life
that might still reside within him.</p>

<p>It was a rough method of resuscitation. In the opinion of
those who are large in their experiences, and have tried this
species of entertainment in addition to their other sports, it
is considerably worse in itself, than the preliminary act of
being drowned, which no one yet has ventured to set down
as altogether funny. But the first gleam of consciousness
was a ray of sunshine to Perry Winkle; not because he had
been restored to existence&mdash;Perry Winkle is rather indifferent
than otherwise on that score, considering it a little unworthy
of the true philosopher to have "vitativeness large"&mdash;but
because it illustrated an idea. It could not be denied
that the shakes and bruises to which he had been so remorselessly
subjected were vexatious, pain being a downright evil,
as every one who has had a chance to know, must be aware.

<!-- page 34 -->

The clustering embellishments of his craniology&mdash;for Perry
had not then thought much of his hair off&mdash;had been not a
little diminished, leaving grievous reminiscences behind, by
the boat-hook and other means resorted to for the purpose
of drawing him from the bosom of the deep. His cuticle
exhibited many fractures, as distressing to look upon as they
were doleful to endure; and he was half-smothered, besides,
by the curious crowd of idlers on the wharf, who were studying
the curative art upon his proper corporation, and were
trying a vast detail of experiment on his personal identity.
After they had held him up manually by the heels, and were
somewhat pleased with the antipodean spectacle, they protracted
their recreation more at leisure by using a block and
tackle with the same object, as if it were intended to flay the
victim; so that when Perry snapped his eyes for the first
time, he thought, naturally enough, that he had got to another
world, where our order of things is reversed, and where
"topsy-turvy" is the habitual practice; or that he had floated
off to the cannibals, and was now being "dressed for dinner,"
not where he eats, but where he is eaten. And to be bundled
hither and yon upon a barrel, which could not be described
as travelling upon springs, let those do so who like it. Perry
Winkle is not of their sort.</p>

<p>But he had other sufferings to undergo. There was one
man who thought that he had a specific for bringing the
dead to life, by the application of Scotch snuff; and Perry
Winkle's reluctant nose received a liberal supply, it being
supposed that such an appeal to his senses was not to be
resisted by any one who intended to oblige his friends by
revisiting the glimpses of the moon. To be sure, it was
immediately declared, when his nose spiritedly resented the
insult, that he was coming to, on the ground that "he sneezed
fust rate," as any nose having pretensions to vitality would
have done when thus assailed; but whatever of delectation
might have been found in a "fust-rate sneeze" under such
circumstances, we do not, for our own part, believe that it

<!-- page 35 -->

was enhanced by the renewed application which it induced,
under the popular impression that if a little is good, a great
deal more must be better; until, in despite of his earnest,
but inarticulate remonstrances, Perry Winkle's weeping
eyes were as full of the pungent preparation as his persecuted
proboscis, and until the hapless man, whom water had
spared, was in no little danger of being snuffed out like a
farthing rushlight, escaping from Neptune to perish under
the auspices of that sternutatory divinity who, in Highland
garb, figures at the door of the tobacconist. Perry Winkle
was never good "at a pinch."</p>

<p>Nor was it an exquisite delight, in addition, to be fumigated
freely with the worst kind of "long nine," by that party
of practitioners who held it as a cardinal maxim, that one's
chances of existence are to be estimated by the vigor with
which he may be provoked to cough. And then, again,
the spirits which were forced down his throat to "warm
him up," were rather remarkable for strength than for flavor,
and excoriated as they went. It was not enough that
Perry Winkle had been drowned and had been compelled
to take the trouble to come to life, without the slightest
regard to his own personal views upon a matter which so
nearly concerned him&mdash;for he might have preferred, had he
known all that was in waiting for him, to have continued as
he was and where he was, among the little fishes, to be nibbled
quietly; but he had likewise the task imposed upon
him, to get well of his doctors&mdash;to patronize the Balm of
Columbia, that his hair might grow anew&mdash;to recover from
the effects, not only of his suspended animation, but likewise
of his suspended body, which had been hung contrary
to the manner congenial to bodies, and had a right, therefore,
to be indignant&mdash;to forget his unwilling ride upon a
barrel, to which he had been compelled, as if he were qualified
for the work, like a bandy Bacchus, or had been formally
sentenced to be broken upon the wheel&mdash;to be oblivious
moreover, of snuff, cigars, and spirits, which, pleasant

<!-- page 36 -->

sins though they be to some among the human family, are
not to be considered as temptations, when used upon the
individual remedially and <i>nolens volens</i>.</p>

<p>Who, let us ask again, after so many miles of parenthesis,
would have been gratified, like Perry Winkle&mdash;not that he
was still in positive existence&mdash;there are people to be met
with who, though neither useful nor ornamental, could contrive
to be pleased at that&mdash;but because his own lugubrious
predictions had been verified?</p>

<p>"Atchee!" sneezed Perry, as he sat upon the barrel&mdash;"atchee!&mdash;stop
off the snuff to this 'ere injine&mdash;every man
smoke himself. I tell you&mdash;you&mdash;sir, with cigars at a
cent a grab, and a hatful for a thank'ee, I'm not the glass
works, all chimbly. Am I drowned, or am I not?&mdash;quit
punching me in the ribs, and don't blow them bellowses
down my throat any more. I've got breath enough already
to last a week, and you can't blow a man any more alive
than he's got room for. Am I still in the United States of
Amerekey, agoing to the election, or have I lost my vote
and gone somewheres else by water? Am I defunct?&mdash;hat's
the question, Mr. Cheerman."</p>

<p>On being furnished with all the information he required,
Perry Winkle indulged in that creaking and rather sinister
apology for a laugh, which is habitual to him. It is his idiosyncratic
laugh. One can always tell when Winkle laughs,
that a disaster has occurred. Mischief is at hand&mdash;mischief
which Perry had foretold.</p>

<p>Perry Winkle only laughs when other people would cry.
His mother took it for granted, when that sound was heard,
that something had been broken. It invariably indicated
that a screw was loose. Perry Winkle laughed o' this
fashion, when Dobbin threw him over the fence. He
looked up and laughed in Dobbin's face, because he had
said, when his father placed him on the horse's back, that
he knew he would get a tumble, and he did&mdash;just as he
expected. Perry Winkle's laughs are mainly of that kind

<!-- page 37 -->

which are said to be produced "on the wrong side of the
mouth." He constructs them there.</p>

<p>"Hee! haugh! heugh!" laughed Perry, with a groaning
sound; "I was just as sure this would happen jist so,
as I am that I got up this morning. I'll leave it to old
Tarpaul himself, if I didn't say his hulk of a boat would
never do with its new sail&mdash;didn't I say she was too crank,
with a great shot-tower of a mast&mdash;didn't I say that the
first puff of wind would make his six-acre lot of a mainsail
pull us right over; and weren't we upsot beautiful in less
than half an hour? He wanted to shorten sail; but I
wouldn't let him alter his stupid arrangements, and made
him keep 'em as they were, so we could see who was right
and who knowed best. He! he! who-o-o!" and Perry
groaned again. "Didn't I tell 'em all we'd soon be down
to David Joneses, riding sturgeons and chasing catfish, if
things were kept so, and didn't I make the fellows keep 'em
so, because they snickered and said I was a loblolly know-nothing?
And then&mdash;smack!&mdash;didn't the breeze come,
turning us head over heels, and this side up with care, in
less than half a jiffy? I told you how it would be, said this
little gentleman, as we went ca-splash into the water. Fool
who, said I, about working a sailboat? I haven't had such
a laugh for a year, and I wouldn't be done laughing yet if
Tarpaul had not tuck me by the legs and pulled me right
under water. Water sort of spoils jokes&mdash;spoils them tee-totally,
as a body may say, when it's mixed more than half
and half. Fishes can't have much fun, seeing that water is
put into everything they've got."</p>

<p>And Perry continued to chuckle and to groan alternately,
until at last he fell back exhausted, as he muttered, "I told
them so&mdash;I know'd exactly how it would be. If we had all
been drowned, it would have been no more than right. Who
asked these people to hook me out? But perhaps it's just
as well, if somebody else has gone to Joneses&mdash;not that I
wish them bad luck, but because I know'd how it would be."

<!-- page 38 -->

Assurances being given, however, that his companions
were also safe, Perry said: "Well, there's some consolation
yet&mdash;how old Tarpaul, and Ned, and Dick, and the rest,
will try to sneak round the corner when they see this child
a coming up the street with his mouth wide open, to ask
'em who it was that know'd best about that boat of theirs.
Pretty fellows, to be sure, to take a man out sailing and
treat him to a capsize!&mdash;I'll make 'em confess that if it
hadn't been for me, not one of 'em would be here now; and
I almost wish I hadn't come to life, so I might tell everybody
whose fault it was that Perry Winkle had been brought to
an untimely end, in the very flower of his youth and beauty.
They'd never have heard the last of it."</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that Perry Winkle is deficient in that
joyous and buoyant trait of character which is classified by
the phrenologists under the name of "hope," and which forms,
not only the mainspring of enterprise, but likewise constitutes
the chief charm of existence. The Perry Winkles are
not at all given to hopefulness. Even when the sun sets,
they are not quite sure that he purposes to rise again; or
are at least doubtful whether they will be in a condition to
witness the spectacle. Perry has no pleasurable anticipations.
His hopes, if he may be represented as having any,
are rather of the funereal cast&mdash;hopes with crape round
their hats and white handkerchiefs to their eyes&mdash;hopes for
the worst. No matter how gay the vista may seem to the
ordinary spectator, Perry Winkle always contrives to discover
the coroner, with an inquest, sitting at the other end
of it, busily engaged in finding a verdict. Shaking his head
in advance. Perry "knew how it would be&mdash;didn't he tell
'em so?"</p>

<p>It was a peculiarity of the earliest development. When
Perry Winkle filled a smaller space in society, being rather
a bud than a rose&mdash;before he became a full-grown tulip&mdash;it
was his chance sometimes to be sent for what, in the vernacular
of Philadelphia, is called, elegantly enough, a "penneth

<!-- page 39 -->

of milk," to enable the elderly Winkles to take their
tea, as Winkles often do. In such cases, it generally happened
that a doleful plaint was soon to be heard at the door
of the paternal mansion. Perry Winkle had returned in
tears&mdash;Macbeth had but a barren sceptre in his gripe, notwithstanding
the fuss he made to obtain it; and in Perry
Winkle's grasp there was no other image of authority than
the handle of the jug. The cunning fiend had juggled with
him as well as with the king of Scotland. But the unfortunate
youth had so much of an advantage that he, even at that early
period of his existence, "know'd how it would be, if they
would send him over there by that big dog"&mdash;though, perhaps,
it was not so much the fault of the "big dog" himself that the
calamity so invariably occurred, as it was attributable to the
little Perry's own conduct, as he stood in his worn cap and
dilapidated check apron, gazing fearfully at the "big dog"
<i>couchant</i> on his master's step&mdash;now making an imperfect
attempt to run past, and then retreating with a doubtful heart&mdash;again
saying "get out," before the "big dog" had stirred,
and shaking the aforesaid apron to alarm the canine dignitary.
It was scarcely an erroneous conclusion on the part
of the "big dog," lazily inclined as he for the most part was,
and as big dogs, thus distinguished from nervous and petulant
little dogs, are apt to be, to imagine that something of
an active nature was expected of him. Under this belief, the
"big dog" would rise to his feet, and as Perry Winkle then
shrieked and ran away, the "big dog" would briskly follow
after and tear, not his own trowsers, but those of Perry Winkle&mdash;not
so much in wrath, as under the impulse of a sense
of duty. The "big dog" thought himself invited to do so&mdash;he
no doubt regarded himself as conferring a favor when he
did so. And as Perry Winkle made it a practice to drop the
entire jug as he fled, and only to pick up the handle thereof,
the "big dog" regarded this feat as included in the performance,
and looked upon it as necessary on his part to continue
tearing the trowsers until the jug operation was completed;

<!-- page 40 -->

after which he returned, with no little of self-satisfaction in
his air, to the original door-step.</p>

<p>Dogs, like men, are under the influence of public opinion.
If they are treated as if they were expected to bite, they will
often act up to the reputation&mdash;good or bad, as it may chance
to be&mdash;which has been made for them in advance. It may,
however, not be amiss to intimate that, as Perry always contrived
to come home without the penny, as well as being
minus in regard to the jug, a suspicion was afloat that he
labored a little to fulfil his own predictions as to how it
"would be," and that, having previously expended the coined
money in the purchase of dainties, he put himself in the "big
dog's" way to secure an excuse. But of this no certain assurances
are to be obtained. It is certain, at least, that
the dog was not in the secret, and Perry keeps his own
counsel.</p>

<p>At school, too&mdash;for Perry Winkle had been at school for
a time, and knew nearly as much when he came away as
he did when he went&mdash;he seldom had the pleasure of an
acquaintance with his lessons, though he always "know'd
how it would be," when appealed to by the rattan on the
subject of extending his knowledge. "Jist what I expected,"
Perry would declare; "I couldn't say one word of it when
master called me up&mdash;not a single word&mdash;and I know'd
exactly how it would be, before I tried. It's always so; and
it's no use sending me to school for the old man to cure his
dyspepsy by dusting my jacket. He says it's all for my own
good! Pretty good, I don't think! It hurts him more than
it does me, hey? Then why don't he hand over the rattan,
and take a regular lambasting himself? I'd larrup him all
day, and never charge nothing for the job&mdash;I'll thank him
for it some day, will I?&mdash;jist wait till I'm grow'd up, and
ketch him out by Fairmount or somewheres&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>Perry played truant, and when detected, said he "know'd
exactly how it would be&mdash;he couldn't get to school, if he tried
ever so hard;" and his academic experiences were brought

<!-- page 41 -->

to a close before he had "completed his education" and
learned everything up. A star went out at that time.</p>

<p>Perry Winkle, then, is not the possessor of those faculties
which enable men to advance themselves in the world. He
contemplates disaster from the outset, and gives himself a
moral defeat before he has entered upon the action. And
hence his career through life, so far as his disposition to hold
back can be called a career, is a series of mishaps. Being
always satisfied that the undertaking will prove unfortunate,
and pursuing it, or rather lagging after it, in such a spirit, he
probably contributes not a little to the fulfilment of his own
predictions. All that has sustained him is, as before hinted,
the enjoyment which he derives from being a true prophet.</p>

<p>Although Mr. Winkle has, in his time, had many situations
which were desirable enough, yet he continued to
"know how it would be," and never failed to be turned out
of employment. "Jist as he expected," he never got from
his bed in time to open the store. He "know'd he would
forget to lock the door," and thieves carried off the goods.
He "know'd he would never remember to take home the
parcels," and customers were indignant. When he had a
little shop of his own, and affairs promised well enough, he
would fasten the front entrance, and go round to the tavern
to prophesy about matters and things in general; and even
then he "know'd exactly how it would be," and that people
always would keep a coming to the shop when he was not
there. And finally, when he was sold out by Venditioni
Exponas, or some other gentleman of the same unceremonious
family, Perry Winkle sat upon the counter drumming
with his heels, and remarking to his sympathizing companions,
as they crowded in upon receipt of the news, "well,
it's jist what I always expected&mdash;it's my luck&mdash;it has to be
so. Didn't I tell you that I'd bust up some day or other,
and hasn't it come true, exactly as I said it would? I'll
leave it to any man here whether I didn't say so; and here

<!-- page 42 -->

is old Venditioni Exponas, to prove that I'm never mistaken.
Somebody ought to treat&mdash;sorrow's dry."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Perry Winkle," responded
old Venditioni Exponas, putting his great white hat more
firmly on his head, and knocking the ivory tip of his big stick
with emphasis upon the counter: "I'll tell you exactly how
it is, and then you may look upon yourself as having learned
something at last. This way you have got of knowing how
things will be, is the very reason why they come to be so. If
you won't get off the track when the locomotive's coming,
anybody might know how it will be. You must take the
trouble to jump out of the way, or you'll be run over. Stir
your stumps&mdash;that's the doctrine. A good many curious
concerns have been invented, but there's no machine yet to
take care of people. They have to do it for themselves.
Steam is marvellous, and clock-works are surprising&mdash;start
'em and they'll go&mdash;wind 'em up and they'll run&mdash;and you
can either turn in to sleep, or step out to see the soldiers.
But self-keeping shops have not been discovered. Can a
steam-engine fork over the change for a five-dollar note?&mdash;can
it measure off goods, hand a chair to the ladies, make a
bow, or say thank'ee, ma'am? No&mdash;you must mind your
shop yourself, if you want your shop to mind you. A shop
is more jealous than a sweetheart&mdash;you must keep paying
it attention all the time, studdy."</p>

<p>"I know'd it would be so," observed Perry Winkle, as
Mr. Exponas turned indignantly away, to make an inventory
of the goods; "it's jist what I expected&mdash;constables is sassy,
always. They think that people's things are only made to
be seized and sold out, and that human natur' was sent down
here jist to have writs served upon it, or to be tuck up for
debts and assault and battery. But it's no more than what
I expected&mdash;and I knew it was my fate some time or other
to be bully-ragg'd in the legal way. When they built the
debtor's apartment, they had me in their eyes."</p>

<p>THE MORAL OF GOSLYNE GREENE:</p>

<p class="small">WHO WAS BORN TO A FORTUNE.</p>

</div>

<p>THAT man is a moral.</p>

<p>He is historically complete&mdash;a hero who has achieved his
climax and has survived his catastrophe&mdash;one of those luckless
wights who outlive themselves, and tarry on the stage
when their drama is over, posthumous to the action of the
piece. Nothing can be more poetically ungraceful than to
exist too long, and to go slouching down the world on the
wrong side of your crisis, like the stupid stalk of an exploded
rocket.</p>

<p>To be a moral&mdash;</p>

<p>Morals, in their plurality of number, are entitled to respect;
but make it, gentle reader, ambitious though you chance to
be, a matter both of solicitude and solicitation, that you may
never, in the singular point of view, obtain the sad pre-eminence
of being elevated to the rank of a moral, to be stuck
with a pin upon a card in the cabinet of ethical entomology,
as a theme for lectures. The moral deducible from one's
own experiences, is in some sort antagonistical to himself.
It rises at the other end of the plank, and soars to importance
as a text, just as he declines from the equipoise of a
true balance. When, for instance, we are in the mire, our
moral is at its superlative height of interest; and, generally
speaking, the individual is capable of affording the most
impressive moral when his morals are in their extreme state
of dilapidation. It is too much to ask, even of a philanthropist,
that he should himself be a moral; but, luckily,

<!-- page 44 -->

there are volunteers enough to supply the demand. As we
said before&mdash;</p>

<p>That man is a moral.</p>

<p>You may see it in the sad dejection of his visage&mdash;in his
pallid cheek and in his vacant aspect. There is also that indescribable
air of shabby gentility in his well-worn garments,
which belongs almost exclusively to the man who is a moral,
had we no manifestation in his habitual deportment that he
has done with ambition and has parted with his hope. He
moves, as it were, in solitude, though bustling crowds may
throng the street. Amid the din of business or the hum of
pleasure, there seems to be a circlet of silence about him;
and people unconsciously feel it as he approaches, that this
man is a moral. They have at once an inclination to sympathize
with him, they can not tell why, and yet to avoid
him, they know not wherefore. Faces lengthen as he
comes, and there is a passing chill in the atmosphere. The
very children are disposed to circumnavigate him, by a
detour to the right or left, as if they were aware that a lesson,
and a lesson somewhat of the hardest, is before them.
There is no mistaking the fact. A broken spirit buttons to
the chin. Misanthropy, even if it is fortunate enough to
possess the article, displays no collar to its shirt; for what
cares it for vanity? And the man who has no expectation
to feed his energies, indicates forlornness by a gloomy slam
of the hat, that he may see and not be seen, knowing that
it is by the eyes alone we learn aught of each other, and
that if they be shaded from the view, we are isolated and
apart. We can not err. He who loiters in the highways
when others hurry by&mdash;he who reposes in public squares
when nothing else is there but a truant dog or two in race
through the grass, must be a moral, a completed moral&mdash;a
deduction and an inference from the aggregate of active
humanity, to be read and pondered over at the close of the
fable. He is something that was&mdash;something which now only
appears to be.</p>

<!-- page 45 -->

<p>But why was he&mdash;why was Goslyne Greene&mdash;for it is
of him we speak&mdash;why was this man loaded with a moral?
why is it his hard fate to be a locomotive homily and a
perambulating sermon? For no other reason, than that it
was his mishap to begin at the wrong end of existence, and
to construct his story downward.</p>

<p>Yes, it is indeed a terrible thing&mdash;we dread to mention
it&mdash;the pen falters as we write the fearful words, and we
look round with apprehension lest others may be involved in
the same awful concatenation of circumstances; but still,
cheered by the fact that such shocking calamities do not
often happen, and that, on this favored side of the Atlantic
at least, the course of events contributes to preserve the
human race from being thus oppressed, we summon up
courage to announce the fact, that it was the unutterable
wo of Goslyne Greene&mdash;poor unoffending infant&mdash;to be
born to a fortune!&mdash;that it was his disaster to come into
the world as heir to cash, to stocks, to bond and mortgage,
to real estate&mdash;to money in hand, to dividends, to interests,
and to rents. He cried&mdash;afflicted child&mdash;when he was thus
inauspiciously ushered into life, and for several days, and
nights too, if tradition is to be credited, he continued to upraise
his tiny and inarticulate voice, as if in remonstrance
at the wrong which had been done to him. Nay, he was
long a wailing babe, pained in anticipation by his melancholy
moral. "Good gracious," exclaimed the nurse,
"what ails the boy!" and the choicest drugs that chymic
art could offer, went soothingly down his vocal throat, but
without affecting the pacification of Goslyne Greene. It
was not physical, but metaphysical, aid that he needed, and
Mrs. Jones was incapable of the ministration.</p>

<p>Unhappy Goslyne Greene!&mdash;and yet his mother received
visits of congratulation, and people shook his father by, the
hand. There were rejoicings in the mansion. Matrons
and maids strove gleefully to welcome the little stranger;
and every one who gazed upon him, endeavored by the

<!-- page 46 -->

force of imagination, to discover family resemblances in his
round undeveloped features, or, at least, beauty in his infantile
ugliness. Our Goslyne was a love, a darling&mdash;the
image of its "ma"&mdash;a counterpart of "pa." The phrenologists
promised genius, and there was reason to apprehend,
in short, that Crichton would no longer have the monopoly
of being "admirable," and that the river would be set on
fire at last, through the gifts of Goslyne Greene. But while,
in this respect, he only shared the common lot&mdash;for we are
all prodigies in the cradle&mdash;still Goslyne had lace upon his
cap and velvet to his couch, with splendor all about. Born
to a fortune! Enviable creature!&mdash;Why did he thus
wrinkle up his pudgy nose and weep with direful squalls?
The more he was kissed, the more he was caressed, the
more he was admired and felicitated, the more angrily did
he sob and shriek. It may be that his unsophisticated perceptions
saw little else than bitter irony in the flattering
compliments that were bestowed upon him, and could discover
small reason for being glad that another sufferer had
been added to the roll, for the benefit mainly of the tailor,
the physician, and the undertaker, which, it is to be presumed,
is the philosophy of our indignant uproar at the
commencement of this sublunary career.</p>

<p>Besides, what had Goslyne done to be thus doomed to a
fortune? He appeared to have as much intellect as other
babes. His voice was as strong&mdash;his back as straight&mdash;his
legs and arms as capable as theirs; and yet he was to be
denied the natural and lawful use of his gifts and faculties.
No wonder his cries were unremitting, and that his wrath
rose as the state of the case was made obvious by the thronging
of his courtiers.</p>

<p>In truth, Goslyne Greene was himself not at all to blame
in the premises. His father had toiled with but a single
hope that his son might be born to a fortune; and that hope
had been accomplished, as hopes sometimes are, to prove
perhaps that the success of our wishes is not always the

<!-- page 47 -->

most desirable thing that could happen to us. "Goslyne
will be rich, any how," said the old gentleman, in the midst
of his labors, as if he found consolation in the fact, and as if
he had thus secured his son's welfare and happiness beyond
the reach of doubt.</p>

<p>The majority of the world will probably agree in opinion
with the elder Mr. Greene; for it is the popular sentiment
that the fact of being rich, and not the process of getting
rich, is the happiness. But, in this case, and probably in
many others, the reverse was the truth. The father had a
pleasant life enough under the influence of an absorbing
object, while the son is a man with a moral; and it may be
that people are often overruled in this matter, for the advantage
of posterity. Who knows but that the follies and
extravagances of those who have either the command of
wealth or the prospect of it&mdash;their speculations and their
splendors&mdash;their "operations" and their magnificence&mdash;are,
after all, but an element in the plan of wisdom, intended
at intervals to afford a new impulse by a reduction to the
primitive, healthful, and energetic state of having more wants
and wishes than we have the means to supply? A dabble
in the stocks does not always turn out profitably; cotton
sometimes is heavy on our hands, and real estate will sulkily
retrograde, when, by the calculation, it ought to have advanced.
But are we sure that such events are a visitation
of unmitigated disaster? May not that dusky spectre, a
dun, "hated of gods and men," whose portentous tap causes
the heart to quake and the pocket to quiver, have a mission
of far greater importance than to make the mere demand
for money? Superficially considered, it was a sad business
when <i>morus multicaulis</i> toppled from its airy height, and
brought so many to the earth along with it. To find one's
fifty-dollar twigs suddenly reduced to the level of sixpenny
switches, is by no means a pleasant waking from golden
dreams; and to decline from the damask luxury of a chariot
to plain pedestrianism, is a sinking in poetry which affects

<!-- page 48 -->

the mind by the force of contrast. People, for the most
part, are not pleased with changes of so violent a character,
and have a decided aversion to the downward movement,
whatever they may have done to render it indispensable.
And yet reverses are often medicinal. There is much of
virtue in an alternative. The necessity for walking, which
is thus imposed, may be the only prescription to bring the
mind and body back to their native vigor. Both are liable
to be invaded by an apoplectic pursiness, which demands
severe training to preserve us from lethargy, and to afford
room for the salutary play of our faculties. The spirit, like
the corporeal fabric in which it is enclosed, is exposed to
the danger of growing rotund, asthmatic, indolent, and unwieldly;
and perchance, even as regards those for whom we
labor, if our vision were keen enough to embrace the whole
scheme of this earthly struggle, we might be induced to look
upon a financial catastrophe now and then, as a providential
interference, and to rejoice over the enlivening incident of
being ruined occasionally, as if it were a capital prize in the
lottery of adventure&mdash;like a shower-bath&mdash;a sharp shock to
the nerves; but, in its reaction, exceedingly tonic and refreshing.</p>

<p>The elder Mr. Greene, however, was rather of a practical
cast than of a meditative nature, content in the outward
seeming of things without cracking for the kernel; and it is
not at all likely that he would have credited it, even if you
had told him so, that the primitive Goslyne is the safest bird,
and that, when it is compelled to nibble over a somewhat
arid common for a living, the position is better than if the
nutriment were gathered to its neb. Observe, now, when
a man's pockets are stimulantly vacant&mdash;when a new coat
is rather an abstract idea than a palpable presence&mdash;when
the pleasure of having a good dinner to-day, is enhanced by
a small and appetizing degree of doubt as to the nature of
the viands which will grace his board to-morrow, what a
quick, lively, interesting little creature he becomes. How

<!-- page 49 -->

his manners are improved; how his temper is ameliorated;
how all sorts of morbidities and misanthropies are shaken
to the winds, as too expensive for indulgence, and how evil
habit is dispensed with until the purse may admit of such
gentlemanlike recreations; while, on the other hand, who
arises willingly from his coach, or has a spontaneous disposition
to go to bed at reasonable hours? Why, what a
languid time we would have of it, if it were only requisite
to form a wish to insure its gratification. Even our planetary
duty of revolving upon an axis, and of strolling round
the sun, for the sake of varieties of light, and for a patronizing
encouragement of the little seasons, might come to be
neglected from a want of inducement to take the trouble of
rolling; and we should lose caste in the solar system by being
too indolent to perform our gyrations, or to extend the
shadow of eclipse.</p>

<p>The elder Mr. Greene would have stared at an attempt
to demonstrate, that perhaps one's real felicity is to be estimated
rather by what one wants, than by what one has;
and, though realizing the truth in his own person, that the
pursuit is often more of a pleasure than the possession, he
would have thought it strange enough, if he had been told
that it is frequently a misfortune to be free from care.</p>

<p>But Goslyne Greene verified a fact, the knowledge of
which had been denied to his paternal predecessor. Though
surrounded by mere conventional thinkers&mdash;by those who
think they think, and labor under the delusion of supposing
they have opinions of their own, when they only reflect the
image presented to them&mdash;and who, by dint of reiteration
had worn out Goslyne's original and instinctive aversions
to his peculiar position in the world, manifested by juvenile
whimpers, which had more of wisdom in them than is often
to be found in the gravest nod of a snow-crowned head&mdash;still
Goslyne returned at last, but rather circuitously, it
must be confessed, to the primary sentiment, and perfected
the moral. In the long interval, however, he was "sophisticate;"

<!-- page 50 -->

and, like the mass of mankind, took things for true
because everybody says so, when perhaps this species of
universal concession is rather a suspicious circumstance, and
should awaken scrutiny.</p>

<p>"Born to fortune" came, therefore, pleasantly enough to
the ears of Goslyne Greene. He soon learned to consider
himself as an exempt from the discipline of the drill sergeant.
The filings and facings which necessity imposes were nothing
to him. There was no reason why his step should be regulated,
or why he should be obliged to march to measure.
Goslyne had a gun before he had any conception of the purposes
of that complicated contrivance. Goslyne had a pony,
with a "colored gentleman" appurtenant, to hold him on the
saddle. Goslyne had a watch before he knew there was such a
thing as time, and before he had the slightest idea of the trouble
he would hereafter have to kill the horological enemy, which
was destined to hang so heavy on his hands. Other children
must dream of drums and sigh for drums till Christmas; but
drums were attainable by Goslyne every day in the year;
and drums, thus reduced to their sheepskin realities&mdash;the
drum in fact, and not the drum of imagination&mdash;became a
weariness. It is not our business to invalidate proverbs, and
the birds may have it their own way; but an anticipated
drum is in every respect more fascinating than any quantity
of drums in hand; and the philosophy of this has an extended
application. Goslyne, however, had no anticipations. Almost
from the very outset, he was compelled to puzzle himself to
imagine new pleasures, and to harass his mind to conceive a
want. Now, there are few distresses more essentially distressing
than to want a want. Other difficulties may be surmounted;
but when we experience a difficulty because we
have not got a difficulty, what is to be done? Goslyne had
many fatiguing hunts through the region of his fancy, in the
hope that under some unsuspected, untried bush, he might
be lucky enough to beat up an unsatisfied desire. How often
did he wish that there was something which he had not, that

<!-- page 51 -->

he might enjoy the sport of wishing that he could have it&mdash;a
common amusement enough, but one with which Goslyne
was not at all familiar; and it was this very deficiency that
goaded him on to his moral.</p>

<p>From the force of circumstances, Goslyne unavoidably became
an indolent boy. People did everything for him, when
it is childhood's happy impulse to do all things, however imperfectly,
for itself, and when it joyfully seeks the wisdom
of experience, by an endless variety of experiments, triumphing
through tears, tumbles, breakages, and damage of all
sorts and sizes. But Goslyne was supervised and carefully
tended; and being born to a fortune, the mountain came to
the little Mahomet, instead of Mahomet going to the mountain.
He rarely, indeed, had the opportunity of improving
himself by a fall down stairs on his own special account;
and probably never gathered knowledge by an uninterrupted
dabble in a tub of water. If he would climb the fence, John
lifted him to the top; and if he wanted to make a horse of
the poker, an expensive toy was substituted, to the death of
all ingenuity and imagination. Goslyne was tamed and
tranquillized at last into a nice boy, and his mind, like his
body, lost relish for adventure. He looked to others for his
entertainment, and required grimaces to be made at him to
create his laughter. John beat the hoop, while Goslyne
looked on; and Tom turned heels over head, that Goslyne
might enjoy the sport without risking a bruise. It was a
business to amuse the child, when that is a business belonging
chiefly to the child itself.</p>

<p>Goslyne had not even elasticity enough left for mischief, it
was so tiresome when the edge of its novelty had been somewhat
blunted by repetition. What fun is there in the demolition
of windows, when one would just as soon pay for the
broken glass as not? Who would fatigue himself to run
down all manner of streets, when half a dollar is sure to stop
the pursuit? Why poach for fruit upon forbidden ground,
when cash can procure much better fruit, with John to go

<!-- page 52 -->

for it, and with no agitation of trouble and excitement?
Goslyne had not discovered that this "trouble" constitutes
the poetry of almost everything within the range of human
enjoyment. We are born to trouble; and it is lucky that it
is so, or how should we fill up our time? It might not, perhaps,
be difficult to demonstrate that the abrogation of domestic
and scholastic "correction," which is yielding to the
progress of innovating philanthropy, has made the present
generation less jocund than its predecessors. For who can
deny that it was an exquisite pleasure to " 'scape whipping,"
when that description of appeal to the feelings was in fashion?
But the enlivening sensations thus derivable were not
accorded to the wealthy Goslyne Greene, as being an enjoyment
suitable only to the plebeian order. No wonder he
yawned&mdash;nobody ever ventured to put him in a rage by
thwartings and contradiction. How could he do otherwise
than stagnate?</p>

<p>In the matter of acquirement at school and at college, the
achievements of Mr. Greene were just about what would be
anticipated from his earlier training; and he arrived at the
conclusion to have it so, by two converging processes of
thought, which were brief, and did not impose a heavy tax
upon the reasoning powers.</p>

<p>"Learning things is a trouble," said Goslyne, "and I
hate trouble. What's the use of being rich, if we are to
have trouble?"</p>

<p>This was the first stretch of his intellect; and he reposed
upon its laurels for a considerable series of years, when, his
faculties being fully matured, he reflected as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What do people take trouble for&mdash;what do they learn
things for? Why, to get a living. But I have got a living
already, and more than a living. Then, what's the use?"</p>

<p>And Goslyne ceased to think further on the subject, lest
he should injure the delicate organization of his brain by the
entertainment of abstruse propositions. He, therefore,
yawned and sauntered through academic groves until he

<!-- page 53 -->

reached the estate of manhood, together with the estate
which his father had accumulated for him.</p>

<p>Now came the most arduous part of the effort to live
pleasurably without trouble&mdash;to gather roses without a
thorn. Never was humanity more perplexed. The tiresome
fiend was close at Goslyne's heels wherever he might be,
whether vegetating at home or hurrying in travel. He tried
change of place. He tried horses and dogs. Gay companions
wearied him. Amusements became insipid. There
appeared to be no end to the day, and the night was equally
as "tardy-gaited." The delights of the table seemed to
promise well, and he endeavored to fill up intervals by Apician
indulgences; but he was too inactive in body to carry
on gormandizing to advantage for any length of time; and he
found that to vibrate between the cook and the physician, with
a preponderating tendency toward the man of medicine, was
a species of trouble for which, on the whole, he had very little
fancy. Enlistments under the banner of Bacchus proved
equally unproductive; and in games of hazard, he suffered a
certain degree of annoyance when he lost his money, with no
compensating satisfaction when he won the money of other
people, as he had always cash enough, and had undergone
no such experience in a deficiency thereof to give zest to
pecuniary acquisitions.</p>

<p>He labored to persuade himself once upon a time that he
had fallen in love, undertaking to be sentimental in "yellow
kids," and paying particular attention to costume. The
lady's brothers borrowed his money, drank his wine, smoked
his cigars, rode his horses, broke his carriages, and treated
him in every way as "one of the family;" while the lady
herself dragged him from company to company, from concert
to theatres, caused him to come for her and to go for
her, and danced him through a whole winter; so that, when
they were just about to fix the "happy day," the timely
thought struck him, in the midst of a yawn of unusual width
and weariness, that he did not like the affair altogether, and

<!-- page 54 -->

that he would take no more "trouble" in relation to it.
There was much talk about horsewhips, about breaches of
promise, express and implied, about the pulling of noses,
horizontal and vertical, coupled with hints concerning hair-triggers
and percussion caps.</p>

<p>"As for assaults and battery, suits at law, and permitting
fellows to fire at you as if you were the target in a shooting-gallery,
it's decidedly too much trouble," yawned Goslyne
Greene. "Tell 'em to send in a bill of how much it comes
to for letting me off, and I'll pay. It's cheaper than being
shot, and not half so much trouble as matrimony seems
to be."</p>

<p>But the star of Goslyne Greene had reached its culminating
point, and began to wane. His fortunes had suffered much
from his mode of living, and more from an unwillingness to
encounter the "trouble" to look after his affairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Thimblerig, who had kindly undertaken to manage all
investments for him, and to increase his cash by profitable
speculation, thought it proper one fine morning to depart for
Texas, leaving no particular explanatory remarks behind
him, and, indeed, leaving the remarks to be made by other
people, though he left nothing else that was portable or convertible,
either of his own or belonging to the estate of Goslyne
Greene. Goslyne had an idea that he ought to feel as
a goose is reputed to feel.</p>

<p>"I always had a suspicion that Thimblerig was a little of
a rascal," thought he; "but then the fellow was so handy,
and saved such a deal of trouble."</p>

<p>There was something left, to be sure. Thimblerig had
not completely swept the board; but, in such cases, it often
happens that it never rains without pouring. A commercial
crisis swept over the land. Banks exploded; speculations
vanished into thin air; money loaned was not worth seeking
after. The work begun by his faithless agent was now perfected,
and Goslyne Greene was reduced, like mighty C&aelig;sar,
to the petty measure of his physical dimensions, without circumstance

<!-- page 55 -->

or accompaniment&mdash;a simple Goslyne, independent
of feathers.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there's going to be trouble," said he, as he
looked at the collapsed condition of his purse. "But never
mind&mdash;I can borrow."</p>

<p>The theory of borrowing, as Goslyne had learned it, by
occupying the place of a lender, is essentially different from
the practice of borrowing when one tries it on his own account.
The world has various aspects, according to the
position from which it is viewed; and when an individual
"born to a fortune" gets into the reverse attitude, and seeks
to do as he has been done by, the difference is striking.
Goslyne was surprised to find, when he endeavored to live
upon other people as other people had lived on him, that it
was rather a severe and an unpleasant method of operation.</p>

<p>"Well, if I'd had any idea of this before," said he, when
disappointed in an effort to raise five dollars in the way of a
friendly loan, "it would have saved a deal of trouble, and a
considerable quantity of money."</p>

<p>But it was rather too late in the day with the unfortunate
Goslyne Greene, to unlearn everything and to begin his life
anew. He had no qualifications for the task either, even if
the inclination had not been lacking; and he discovered,
painfully enough, that being "born to a fortune," where it is
much easier to make money, difficult as that process may be,
than to keep it when it is made, is not always the greatest
kindness that our guardian angel can bestow. Riches with
us is a bird of an incredible power of wing, and has qualities
of escape and evasion which skill itself is often unavailing to
combat. The bird was gone from Goslyne; but having had
no training as a fowler, there was no help, and he was obliged
to trust his future life to chance.</p>

<p>He ekes out a precarious existence on the reluctant kindness
of former friends, and by appeals to the feelings of his
kinsfolk, who, however near in former times, are now disposed
to be "distant relations" in regard to him. He is,

<!-- page 56 -->

nevertheless, as averse to trouble as ever, when there is a
possibility of avoiding it, and rarely removes from hotel or
boarding-house until the politeness of the landlord induces
him to say, that he will forgive arrearage for the sake
of hastening Mr. Goslyne Greene's departure from the
premises.</p>

<p>"And that is what I call behaving like a gentleman," says
Mr. Greene; "it saves a deal of trouble in the adjustment
of accounts; and as I don't understand figures, people are
so apt to impose upon me."</p>

<p>Latterly, however, he begins to think that this mode of settlement
is too much to the advantage of the opposite party,
and that he, being at the trouble of looking out for a new
domicil, should have something to boot, in the shape of a
small subsidy or an order upon a ready-made clothing establishment,
just for the sake of symmetry and to make the matter
perfectly square; and he proposes to carry out the idea
when the next occasion offers itself. Whether his conduct
in thus obtaining credit, is altogether creditable, is left to
the reader to decide. It is enough for us to have presented
"The Moral of Goslyne Greene, who was born to a fortune,"
that they who are not thus distinguished may rejoice over
their peculiar happiness in being with the majority on this
question, and esteem themselves lucky in beginning life at
its smaller and lower end.</p>

<p>JOHNNY JUMPUP,</p>

<p>LIFE is full of difficulties&mdash;a trying time it is altogether,
not only in the Oyer and Terminer, but likewise in other
places quite as remote from justice as the courts of law.
Everybody lives, after a fashion. They must do it, or embrace
an alternative that is disagreeable; but there are many
who find that to live, easy and natural as some people may
think it, is one of the most troublesome jobs they ever undertook.
But after we rise above the mere first principles
of existence, and have succeeded in making tolerably sure
of a reasonable supply of breakfasts, dinners, and suppers,
clothing and house-room included, which is elementary living&mdash;the
practical and physical part, on which we are to
erect the romance, the poetry, and the ornament&mdash;then comes
the grandest perplexity of all, where emulation exists, and
where ambition flourishes, to prevent the individual&mdash;just
as like as not me, or may be you&mdash;from being completely
absorbed in the mass of mankind, as only one in the statistical
returns of the census, and to fashion for him a distinctive
feature of some sort, that shall single him out from the general
family of the race, and cause others to designate him
with "extended finger," as he circulates among the crowd.
Merely to live, and to breathe, and to be the inert consumer of
a certain amount of provant and provision, is that to content
a soul replete with ardor, hungry for preferment, and athirst
to be distinguished?</p>

<p>No&mdash;it is required that we should be a sensation&mdash;an
electric spark&mdash;something on the thunder and lightning

<!-- page 58 -->

principle&mdash;rather than a mere negative quality, with nothing
of the flash or sparkle about it. But how?&mdash;ay, there's
the rub&mdash;how are we to be a shock to the nerve of the
millions?</p>

<p>"That's Stiggins!" say they; and if every eye is turned
at the word, to gaze with wonder and amaze at him who
rejoices in the euphonious appellation of Stiggins&mdash;if the
name of Stiggins hath associations connected with it, either
for good or for evil&mdash;admiring love or malignant hate&mdash;which
are sufficient to attract the regards of all to its lucky
possessor, who so happy as "Stiggins," standing as he does,
upon a pedestal, to receive the homage of the bystanders.</p>

<p>"That's Stiggins!" is the cry, which Stiggins, in proud
humility, affects not to hear, while Stiggins is inwardly
rejoicing at the glances which rest upon his lineaments.</p>

<p>"Hey!&mdash;where?&mdash;what?&mdash;which is Stiggins?"</p>

<p>"Oh, show me Stiggins!"</p>

<p>"Won't he wait till I run home for my wife?&mdash;she's half
dead to see Stiggins."</p>

<p>"Lawks!&mdash;do tell!&mdash;and is that Stiggins? I've seen
Stiggins at last, with my own eyes, I have."</p>

<p>Do not pretend that you do not envy Stiggins&mdash;the happy
Stiggins. When such a state of things as we now attempt
to describe, waits on any of the Stigginses, it may be set
down at once that he has seated himself upon the utmost
"rung" of felicity's ladder&mdash;that he is at the high topgallant
of his joy&mdash;has completed his pyramid and has capped
his climax. Stiggins need not stay&mdash;he may leave the
world now just as soon as he pleases&mdash;there is little left for
him to do.</p>

<p>Why, say'st thou, should Stiggins cease from effort and
permit himself to be evaporated&mdash;why?</p>

<p>Because this is fame&mdash;this is the laurel of renown&mdash;this,
the <i>Ultima Thule</i> of vaulting ambition&mdash;all that Stiggins
can do in the way of elevating himself above the swampy
level of the rest of creation.</p>

<!-- page 59 -->

<p>"Stiggins!"&mdash;with a "Hurrah for Stiggins," or "A groan
for Stiggins"&mdash;either way&mdash;be not particular&mdash;his leafy-laurelled
chaplet is completed. Stiggins has, you see, conquered
a notoriety and climbed unto an apex&mdash;a feat rarely
to be accomplished more than once in a lifetime, it being a
settled rule&mdash;there's so many of us&mdash;that no one shall have
more than a day.</p>

<p>Why should Stiggins be now exploded, and go off, like a
rocket, from the busy stage.</p>

<p>Because, when we are as high as we can go, the notoriety
that has been attained must thenceforth be on the wane, with
a greater or less degree of rapidity, according to the extent
of our skill and tact in the nourishment, cherishment, and
preservation of our passing glory. It is doleful to be one of
the "have beens"&mdash;melancholy to wander about as a member
of the "used to was" family&mdash;and he who is the idolater
of fame, will find it the best policy, if he desires to be
remembered, to disappear in the full meridian of his greatness,
instead of waiting till it is night. For still, it wanes,
do what we will to the contrary; and he who is hailed with
shouts of applause whenever he presents himself in public,
should be as busy with his hay as possible, now that the sun
is shining; for very soon he will decline into nothing more
than one of the multitude, and be left to wonder what has
become of the thronging circle of his admirers. The truth
is, that the public can not afford to be puffing up anybody's
balloon for a length of time, and are apt, after a while to permit
it to drop down in a state of collapse. But to dismiss
such saddening reflections upon the mutabilities of things,
let us repeat once more, like a chubby-cheeked Fame in full
blast upon a speaking-trumpet&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's Stiggins!"</p>

<p>Let Stiggins rejoice in his distinction: for no matter how
he conquered it, and it avails not why it is accorded to him,
it can not be denied that he&mdash;Stiggins&mdash;is now what we
may call a thing of glory and a matter of renown.&mdash;Is it not

<!-- page 60 -->

for this that the writer burns the midnight oil; and, like the
cuttle-fish, darkens all around him by an inky flood?&mdash;Fame!&mdash;"<i>monstrari
digito</i>"&mdash;"there he goes!"&mdash;does not
the warrior fight for it, bleed for it, die for it? And what
toils, what dangers, what perils, do we not cheerfully undergo
for such reward, unsubstantial as it may appear?&mdash;Notoriety&mdash;distinction!&mdash;ambition
craves; and there is not
a path to such attainment, be it lofty, or be it depressed, that
is not crowned with eager and jostling competitors, only to
hear the welcome whisper as they pass, that "this is Stiggins."</p>

<p>There are all sorts of ways essayed to climb the steeps of
renown. Some of us write books&mdash;others fight in battles&mdash;the
duello is resorted to by many&mdash;others keep race-horses;
while there be men in the pursuit of fame, who will eat you
a hundred or two of oysters at a single sitting, on a wager,
and down in a cellar.</p>

<p>Fame&mdash;we must have fame, if we can get it&mdash;a little
something peculiar to ourselves, that shall set up and maintain
a difference&mdash;perceptible and admitted&mdash;between us
and all the rest&mdash;"myself alone," with nothing to be seen
of the like pattern in any other person's house, even if the
radiation from our name should not be enabled to cast its
beams beyond the most limited circle; and hence it is&mdash;we
are sure you wince under it yourself&mdash;that no man likes to
be confounded in the minds of persons, indifferent as they
may be to him in the main, with any other man, either
on the score of a similarity of name, or on any account
whatever. There can not, indeed, be a worse compliment
than not to know that Brown is Brown, or that Smith is
Smith, or Jones is Jones; for though there be, as proved by
the directory, many Browns, several Smiths, and not a few
of the Joneses, yet each individual, not only of these names,
but of all other names that may be suggested, feels that he
is, pre-eminently, the person of that name, not to be mistaken
or to be overlooked; and when, awkwardly, as it often happens,

<!-- page 61 -->

an unconsciousness of our existence or of who we are,
is exhibited&mdash;it is a folly to seek to palliate the offence by
soothings or apologies&mdash;our self-love is writhing under a
wound. "Beg pardon&mdash;didn't know you!"&mdash;Yet we have
been here, or there, or elsewhere, all the time&mdash;yea, figuring
just as largely as we could upon our little stage&mdash;and
still you were not aware that we had ever been born at all,
supposing us to be anybody in general, or nobody in particular!
Say no more&mdash;we are essentially snubbed; and you
can not make it better by these bungling efforts to explain
away the original error.</p>

<p>But be careful for the future&mdash;never, while you live, be
so rash as to admit to any person's face that you never
chanced to hear of him before&mdash;never, while you live, be
induced to confess that you mistook him for somebody else,
because there are so many of that name. Better try to play
with lions as you would with common people, than thus
to trifle with a man's identity&mdash;it's dangerous; for it is a
jar, brimming full of bitterness, for any man to discover that
the identity which occupies all his thoughts, all his time, and
all his care, is yet so little of an identity, that he has not
been able to assume a distinctive aspect in the eyes of the
community which surrounds him.</p>

<p>"That's Stiggins!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but who is Stiggins?"</p>

<p>Now, we ask you&mdash;"on your apparel"&mdash;is not such a
cruel query as that enough to be&mdash;apoplectically&mdash;the
death of the hardiest, toughest, knottiest Stiggins, that ever
floated on the tide of time? "Unknown," as they say in
the bills of mortality, would not that be fatal to the most
vital of us? And then, to hear our dear self spoken of so
cheaply as "a Mr. Stiggins"&mdash;"one Mr. Stiggins"&mdash;or,
worse than either, "some Mr. Stiggins," as if, with all our
toil, we had been so far a failure as not to be able to project
ourselves a single notable inch beyond the level of undistinguished
Stigginsism. It is sufficient to cause any person,

<!-- page 62 -->

however averse to hydropathy, and antagonistical to the cold
water principle, to cast himself into the river, as the nearest
attainable approach to <i>felo-de-se</i>.</p>

<p>And here we have it why it is, that indisputable distinction,
whatever be its kind, is so flattering and so precious
that mankind counts no cost too great that may be required
to make it sure; and that everybody fondles it so affectionately
when it has been obtained, often believing, indeed, that
we do possess it when we have it not.</p>

<p>And so, too, in paternal and maternal affection. It is not
to be controverted that the child is yet to be born, which, in
the eyes of those to whom it more immediately appertains,
is not gifted by nature with faculties that will never allow it
to be absorbed in insignificancy, or to be taken and mistaken
for any other child. "There can be no mistake in this child,"
as they say in popular phraseology. It is a bright particular
star in the firmament of babydom. Look, now&mdash;you
see, as it reaches forward to inflict endearing scratches upon
the accommodating nose which you so politely extend toward
it for infancy's special amusement, you see that it
"takes notice," differently from common children, and thus
gives indubitable evidences of a latent genius. Perhaps it
talks sooner&mdash;that's the force of genius&mdash;or may be it talks
later&mdash;that's the slumbering and growing strength of genius&mdash;than
other children talk. It recognises its "da-da"&mdash;its
proud da-da&mdash;in a way that is certainly peculiar to itself;
and it goes on, step by step, in developing one evidence of
coming greatness after another evidence of coming greatness,
so that we are at last stupified to find, on encountering
the test of downright experiment and of actual collision with
the world, that our prodigy was merely a prodigy when in
bud, the genius and the greatness not having survived an
emancipation from the nursery; and then, the prodigy having
itself been, in all likelihood, deluded into a belief that it
is a prodigy, is compelled, painfully and slowly, to discover
its real value, and to acquiesce in being placed, for the rest

<!-- page 63 -->

of its existence, in a position merely subordinate&mdash;a task
which, in many cases, is so replete with mortifications that
it is but imperfectly performed, and the sufferer goes through
life groaning under the erroneous impression that he came
upon the stage before the world was sufficiently advanced
to comprehend his merits, and that he is decidedly "The
Unappreciated One."</p>

<p>At all events, it is clear that the world is ever full of
wonderful babies&mdash;but not remarkable at any time for a
superabundance of wonderful men.</p>

<p>But Johnny Jumpup, however, as any one with half an
eye, may discover from his portrait&mdash;an authentic likeness,
now first published&mdash;is safe&mdash;certain of his distinction, from
the very outset. He&mdash;Johnny&mdash;is not to be mistaken for
anybody else&mdash;for, physically and longitudinally&mdash;by feet
and by inches&mdash;he&mdash;Johnny&mdash;rises far above all cavil and
all dispute. He looks down upon them with disdain. His
elevation&mdash;Jumpup's&mdash;is not to be reached by others, unless
recourse be had to a chair or to a pile of bricks. But Johnny
is up already; and there is no such thing as the getting of
him down, unless he should be <i>razeed</i>, by a cannon-ball, of
which, we think, there is no likelihood at present.</p>

<p>As you may have had occasion to remark, the family of
the Jumpups are none of your lowly-minded people, who
feel and act as if they were intruders in the walks of men.
Not at all&mdash;the Jumpups know they have as good a right
to be here as anybody&mdash;they doubt, indeed, whether their
right to be here is not a shade or two better than that of anybody
with whom they are acquainted, having always, as Sylvester
Daggerwood quaintly expresses it, "a soul above buttons;"
but as everybody else does not place them so far
above buttons as they place themselves, the Jumpups pant
for that distinction to which all must bow. The Jumpups
thought of the making of money in the first instance, as perhaps
the shortest cut to glory; and it is of material assistance;
and so they toiled and they traded&mdash;bargained, sold,

<!-- page 64 -->

swopped, exchanged, and "chiselled," day in and day out,
till Dame Fortune, finding herself so vehemently besieged,
could resist no longer, and yielded herself to their persevering
arms. Eldad Jumpup&mdash;the father of Johnny&mdash;eventually
become one of the richest men about&mdash;bowed to at the
exchange&mdash;chairman of all sorts of meetings&mdash;heading subscriptions,
and having a voice potential in mercantile and
monetary affairs. But in this respect, others contrived at
last to be as renowned as he&mdash;the name of Jumpup could
not stand here alone, "grand, gloomy, and peculiar;" and
then Eldad Jumpup endeavored to attain originality by the
effort to conjoin literature to commerce; and he purchased
a large assortment of books in exquisite binding&mdash;had his
portrait painted, in a library&mdash;himself with pen in hand,
thinking hard over a pile of octavoes, as if crammed with
their contents, and endeavoring to give voice to the inspiration
awakened. But there is a marvellous difference between
the buying of books and the reading of books&mdash;between
the wish for literary laurel, and the processes of
gathering the plant; and Eldad Jumpup very often found
himself awakened from unexpected slumber, there in the
library, by the sonorous fall of the selected volume from his
unconscious hand, books proving rather soporific to one so
long accustomed to stirring realities and active competitions.</p>

<p>"Ho! ho!" cried Eldad, "this will never do. I'll hire
some fellow to read these books for me, and make a division
of the labor."</p>

<p>So he had recourse in the next instance to what may be
called the hospitalities&mdash;town-house, country-house, dinners,
and so forth. But even then, people would contradict him at
his own table, and talk of him as "no great shakes," when
he wanted to be "a great shakes"&mdash;what's the use of living,
if you are not considerable of a "shakes"?&mdash;they would so
talk of him at the very moment when they were fattening
their lean and withered frames with his viands and at his expense.</p>

<!-- page 65 -->

<p>But had he not Johnny? When his own hopes of being a
peculiar and leading feature were thus foiled and so blighted,
was there not Johnny? What could be done to manufacture
Johnny Jumpup into a great man?&mdash;Johnny not being
troubled with any traits different from common traits, except
that as regards eating and sleeping he could do a larger business
than any one else. In these regards Johnny was clever&mdash;undeniably.</p>

<p>"That boy's always asleep," observed Eldad, gravely;
"he shows no other genius now&mdash;can't sing&mdash;can't draw&mdash;won't
talk&mdash;doesn't like to run about, and never made anything
in his life&mdash;nothing but sleep. Extraordinary boy&mdash;sleeping
so much must mean something, I'm sure of that&mdash;but
what does it mean? I'd like to know. It's his genius,
I guess, growing in his head while he's asleep&mdash;it don't want
to be disturbed now, but by'm'by it will come out in a perfect
blaze of glory. If it don't, I'll turn him out as an impostor.</p>

<p>"And besides, now I think of it, when Johnny is not asleep,
Johnny is always eating. That's wonderful, too&mdash;very wonderful.
It's the genius&mdash;some sort of genius&mdash;getting into
the stomach that makes Johnny so hungry&mdash;genius is always
hungry, more or less; because, you see, it wants nourishment.
So, what between sleeping and eating, I don't see
how Johnny Jumpup can very well fail of being a great man,
because it's quite clear he doesn't waste any of his strength
or trifle away any of his ideas&mdash;nobody ever gets an idea
from Johnny&mdash;he's too cunning for that."</p>

<p>All at once, Johnny's genius did make itself apparent;
and the real meaning of the phenomena of much eating and
incessant sleeping, so strongly exhibited in his case, became
obvious to the meanest capacity. His abilities took an upward
direction, drawing him out, though Johnny said nothing
on the subject himself&mdash;drawing him out, story after
story, like a telescope or a portable fishing-rod. He ate,
and he slept, and he grew&mdash;every week let out a new tuck

<!-- page 66 -->

from his trowsers, and his arms went a considerable distance
through the sleeves of his jacket. There was no denying it,
that Johnny was destined, in one way at least, to be a great
man, and to be discovered easily in the thickest of the crowd.
So was it that the paternal desires were realized. Nobody
else had such a Johnny.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>And now comes the delicate consideration as to whether
in the main, it be best for us or not, that our wishes in regard
to ourselves or our offspring should be realized. When we
look into things with our philosophic eye alone, closing all
other eyes, it will often be apparent that a supposed blessing
is often a misfortune, and that it is, after all, better for us to
be just as we are, rather than any other way. Admire the
extent of Johnny Jumpup as much as you please&mdash;you that
are brief and dumpy&mdash;we fear that Johnny could, if he would,
tell a very different story about the matter.</p>

<p>For instance, Johnny Jumpup is invariably in the way.
"Gracious alive!&mdash;do, Johnny, double yourself up, instead
of poking your legs all over the room, to break people's
necks."</p>

<p>Long as he is, people are ever short with Johnny on the
subject of his extensions, forgetting too, in their wrath at
being unintentionally tripped, that Johnny "suffers some" in
the process as well as they.</p>

<p>"Oh, Johnny! you're only fit to hand things down from
high shelves, or to look into second-story windows. They'd
better hire you to light the lamps, or to whitewash ceilings."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," says Johnny himself, "it's all very dignified
and commanding, I've no doubt, to be stretched out this way,
like a scaffold-pole or part of the magnetic telegraph; but
that doesn't pay for the knocks I get on the head, or make
the beds any longer. I can look down upon people, of
course; but what's that to having to keep curled up like a
coil of rope more than half the time?&mdash;It's entirely too much
trouble to be a great man. Great men do well enough for

<!-- page 67 -->

extraordinary occasions, but I'd rather be a common people
for everyday wear; and I'm half inclined to wish that somebody
would take me in a little, or cut me off short. It's a
deal of trouble to be always trying to make one's self small:
for when I feel the smallest, it's just then that I'm the largest
and the most in the way. I wish I was brother to Tom
Thumb. It's every way cheaper and more convenient."</p>

<p>Just so&mdash;who is content?&mdash;not Johnny Jumpup, with all
his advantages; and we have here another lesson to be always
as contented as possible with our lot. It is a doubt
whether we could change it to any advantage, or whether,
if we could have our children as we wish them, it would be
of advantage either to them or to us. Remember Johnny
Jumpup, who finds that this world, having been prepared for
people of the smaller extension, is ever at war with his comforts.
No one can tell how many of the swinging-lamps are
destroyed by Johnny Jumpup, or how often his hat is swept
from his brow by the awnings of the street. He dares not
rise from his chair with precipitation, lest it prove that the
ceiling is too low; and his phrenological faculties are literally
beaten in by the concussions to which he is so unceasingly
exposed. When he stops to shake hands with any one, he
has a pain in his back from the stooping; and the boys shout
after him in the street as "the man who is too long anywhere."
Jumpup is modest; yet Jumpup is made the target
for jokes. People hail him as "the man in the steeple," to
know where the fire is; and many are the queries to learn
of him what is the state of the weather up there. Poor
Jumpup&mdash;wearied and vexed, how is it possible for him to
hide himself from sneering observation, or to avoid the pains
and the penalties of being conspicuous?</p>

<div class="center" id="b2ch06">

<p>MR. KERR MUDGEON:</p>

<p class="small">OR, "YOU WON'T, WON'T YOU."</p>

</div>

<p>THERE; now!</p>

<p>You see&mdash;do you not?&mdash;Nay, you may almost hear it,
if you listen attentively. Mr. Kerr Mudgeon&mdash;great many
of the Kerr Mudgeons about, in various places&mdash;but this
Mr. Kerr Mudgeon&mdash;going to a party as he was&mdash;desirous
too, as people generally are on such occasions, of looking
particularly well&mdash;and all ready, to his own infinite satisfaction&mdash;all
ready except the final operation of putting on
his bettermost coat&mdash;has torn that important article of gentlemanly
costume&mdash;one may work without a coat, you know,
and work all the easier for the relief; but it is not altogether
polite to leave it at home on a peg when you go to a party.
Torn his coat&mdash;not through his own fault, as Mr. Kerr
Mudgeon would tell you explicitly enough&mdash;he never is,
never was, never can be, in fault&mdash;but because of that coat's
ill-timed and provoking resistance to the operation of being
donned. The coat might have known&mdash;who is ever thus to
be trifled with in the process of dressing? Yes, the coat
must have known. Ah, coats and the makers of coats
have much to answer for. Kerr Mudgeon is ruffled, ruffles
of this sort, causing a man to look none the handsomer or
the more amiable for the ruffles. Such ruffles are not
becoming.</p>

<p>"Ho! ho! won't go on, hey?" cried Mr. Kerr Mudgeon,
and Mr. Kerr Mudgeon panted and Mr. Kerr Mudgeon
blew, on the high-pressure principle, until the steam of his
wrath had reached its highest point.</p>

<!-- page 69 -->

<p>It is a fearful moment with the Kerr Mudgeons when it is
manifest that something must break&mdash;a blood-vessel or the
furniture, or the peace of the commonwealth. Why will
things animate and inanimate conspire to bring about such a
crisis? Kerr Mudgeons will be sweet tempered if you will
only permit them.</p>

<p>The coat positively refused to go on any further&mdash;the
contumacious raiment. What could Kerr Mudgeon do in
such a strait of perverse broadcloth?</p>

<p>"Tell me you won't go on," muttered Kerr Mudgeon,
setting his teeth as a rifleman sets his trigger; "I'll make
you go on, I will," shouted he.</p>

<p>There's no such word as fail with Mr. Kerr Mudgeon.
Something is sure to be done when he is once fairly roused
to the work. It is a rule of his to combat like with like;
and so&mdash;and so&mdash;stamping his foot determinedly, and
gathering all his forces for a grand demonstration against
the obstinacy of tight sleeves, he carried his point as he proposed
to carry it, by a rushing <i>coup-de-main</i>, to the material
detriment of the fabric.&mdash;But what of that? Was it not a
victory for Kerr Mudgeon? The coat had yielded to the
force of his will; and if the victory had been gained at cost,
is it not always so with victories!&mdash;Glory&mdash;is that to be
had for nothing?&mdash;No&mdash;depreciate the cost of glory, and
pray tell me what becomes of glory?&mdash;It is glory no longer.
A luxury, to be a luxury, must be beyond the general reach&mdash;too
expensive for the millions&mdash;too costly for the masses.</p>

<p>"And now&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;ho! ho!&mdash;he! he!&mdash;come off!"
shrieked Mr. Kerr Mudgeon; "now you've done all the
mischief you could, come off." Kerr Mudgeon divested himself
of the fractured, now humbled, penitent and discomfited
coat, and followed up his first success, like an able
tactician, he danced in a transport of joy upon its mangled
fragments and its melancholy remains. Ghastly moment of
triumph o'er a foe. Alas! Kerr Mudgeon, be merciful to the
vanquished when incapacited for the war.</p>

<!-- page 70 -->

<p>But no&mdash;coolness comes not on the instant&mdash;not to the
Kerr Mudgeons. They have no relationship to the Kew
Cumbers. They disdain the alliance; and Mr. Kerr Mudgeon's
coat had been conquered only&mdash;not punished.</p>

<p>"That's what you get by being obstinate," added he, as
he kicked the expiring coat about the room, knocking down
a lamp, upsetting an inkstand, and doing sundry other minor
pieces of mischief, all of which, of course, he charged to the
account of the coat, as aforesaid&mdash;it was coat's fault altogether.
Mr. Kerr Mudgeon is not naturally in a passion.
He would not have been in a passion had it not been for the
coat&mdash;not he&mdash;the coat was the incendiary cause; and we
trust that every coat, frock or body&mdash;sackcoat or any other
of the infinite variety of coats now in existence, with all other
coats that are to be, may take timely example and salutary
warning from the doleful fate of Mr. Kerr Mudgeon's coat,
that there may be no sewing of tares, and an exemption
from rent. A coat is never improved by participation in
battle.</p>

<p>And this unhappy coat, which has thus fallen a victim to
its incapacity to adapt itself to the form and pressure of circumstances,
is by no means a singular case in the experience
of Mr. Kerr Mudgeon. We mention it rather as a symbol
and as an emblem of the trials and vexations that ambuscade
his way through life, to vex him at unguarded moments and
shake him from his propriety. Boots, it will appear, have
served him just so, particularly on a warm morning when
unusual effort fevers one for the day. Did you see Kerr
Mudgeon in a contest with his boots, when the leather, like
a sturdy sentinel, refused ingress to Kerr Mudgeon's heel,
and declared that there was "no admission" to the premises,
in despite of coaxings, of soap, and of the pulverizations of
soap-stone? If you never saw that sight, you ought to see
it, before you shuffle off this mortal coil&mdash;indeed you ought,
as Kerr Mudgeon toils and pants at the reluctant boots, in
the vain effort "to grapple them to his sole with hooks of

<!-- page 71 -->

steel." Then it is most especially that a Kerr Mudgeon is
"lovelily dreadful," like ocean in a storm. Whether saltpetre
will explode or not, just set the Kerr Mudgeons at a
tight boot, and you shall hear such explosions of tempestuous
wrath as were never heard under other circumstances. The
gun-cotton is like lambs-wool in comparison, as Kerr Mudgeon
hops about in a state of betweenity, the boot half on,
half off, declining either to go forward or to retreat. We
pity that boot should Kerr Mudgeon find a failure to his deep
intent. It has suffering in store&mdash;a species of storage which
is never agreeable.</p>

<p>Corks, too&mdash;did you ever dwell upon a Kerr Mudgeon
endeavoring to extract a cork, without the mechanical appliances
of a screw? The getting out of corks with one's
fingers is always more or less of a trial. There is donkeyism
in corks; and those that will yield a little, are generally
sure to break. Concession, conciliation, and compromise,
demand, under these circumstances, that if the cork will not
come out, it should be made to go in, to employ the ingenuity
of future ages in fishing it up with slipknots and nooses. But
Kerr Mudgeon with a cork&mdash;he never, "Mr. Brown," can
be prevailed upon to "give it up so;" not even if you find
the cork-screw for him. Rather would he hurt his hand,
loosen his teeth, break his penknife, or twist a fork into an
invalid condition, than allow himself to be ingloriously baffled
by the contemptible oppugnation and hostility of a cork
and bottle, thirsty and impatient as he may be for the imbibation
of the contents thereof. If all else fail, Kerr Mudgeon
enraged, and the bystanders in an agony of nervousness
at the scene&mdash;"smack" goes the bottle's neck against a
table, or "whack" over the back of a chair&mdash;"you won't,
won't you!"&mdash;or in the more protracted and aggravating
case, "smash!" goes the whole bottle to the wall; for the
embellishment of paper hangings and the improvement of
carpeting&mdash;Victoria!</p>

<p>Something is always the matter, too, with the bureau when

he would open or shut a drawer. Either it will not come
out or it won't go in. That drawer must take the consequences;
and doors&mdash;lucky are they to escape a fractured panel,
if doors prove refractory, as doors sometimes will. Nobody
can open a door so featly as a Kerr Mudgeon.</p>

<p>"You won't, won't you!" and so he appeals to the <i>ultima
ratio regum</i>&mdash;the last reasoning of kings&mdash;which means as
many of thumps, cuffs, and kicks, as may be requisite to the
purpose. It is a knock-down argument.</p>

<p>Pooh! pooh!&mdash;how you talk of the efficacy of the soft
answer in the turning away of wrath. Nonsense, Mr.
George Combe, that wrath to the wrathful is only fuel to the
flame. Mr. Kerr Mudgeon has no faith in passive resistance
and in other doctrines of that sort. Smite his cheek, and
then see what will come of the smitation. Go to him if you
want "as good as you give," and you will be sure to obtain
measure, exact, yea, and running over.</p>

<p>And so Mr. Kerr Mudgeon has always a large stock of
quarrel on hand, unsettled and neat as imported&mdash;feuds
everywhere, to keep him warm in the winter season. A
good hater is Mr. Kerr Mudgeon&mdash;a bramble-bush to
scratch withal.</p>

<p>"Try to impose on me," says Kerr Mudgeon, "I'd like
to see 'em at it. They'll soon find I'm not afraid of anybody;"
and he therefore seeks to impress that fact with distinctness
on everybody's mind; and, in consequence, if anybody
has unexpended choler about him&mdash;a pet rage or so,
pent up, or a latent exasperation&mdash;make him acquainted
with Kerr Mudgeon, and observe the effect of the contact of
such a spark as Mudgeon with an inflammable magazine.
Should you find yourself peevish generally, and a little crusty
or so, to those around you&mdash;primed, as it were, for contention,
should it be fairly offered, stop as you go to business,
at Kerr Mudgeon's. He will accommodate you, and you
will feel much better afterward, you will&mdash;"calm as a summer
morning," as the politicians have it.</p>

<!-- page 73 -->

<p>Kerr Mudgeon rides; and his horse must abide a liberal
application of whip and spur, sometimes inducing it as a
corollary, is a tumble to be regarded as a corollary from the
saddle?&mdash;inducing it as a corollary, that Kerr Mudgeon
must abide in the mire, with a fractured tibia or fibia, as the
case may be. "You won't, won't you?"&mdash;and there are
horses who won't when not able clearly to understand what
is to be done. Now, the horse swerves, and Kerr Mudgeon
takes the lateral slide. Again the steed bows&mdash;with politeness
enough&mdash;and Kerr Mudgeon is a flying phenomenon
over his head&mdash;gracefully, like a spread-eagle in a fit of enthusiasm.
When he is <i>down</i> he says he never gives <i>up</i> to a
horse.</p>

<p>Kerr Mudgeon delights also to quicken the paces of your
lounging dog, by such abrupt and sharp appeal to the feelings
of the animal as occasion may suggest; and often there
is an interchange of compliment, biped and quadrupedal,
thus elicited, returning bites for blows, to square accounts
between human attack and canine indignation. Some dogs
do not appreciate graceful attentions and captivating endearments.
"Dogs are so revengeful," says Kerr Mudgeon.
His dogs always run away; "dogs are so ungrateful, too,"
quoth he.</p>

<p>Unfortunate Kerr Mudgeon! What is to become of him
until the world is rendered more complaisant and acquiescent,
prepared in all respects to go his way?</p>

<p>In the street, he takes the straightest line from place to
place, having learnt from his schoolboy mathematics, that
this is decidedly the shortest method of going from place to
place. And yet, how people jostle him, first on the right
hand, then on the left? Why do they not clear the track for
Kerr Mudgeon?</p>

<p>Then at the postoffice, in the hour of delivery.</p>

<p>Kerr Mudgeon wants his letters. What is more natural
than that a man should want his letters?</p>

<!-- page 74 -->

<p>"Quit scrouging!" says somebody, as he knocks Mr. Kerr
Mudgeon in the ribs with his elbow.</p>

<p>"Wait for your turn!" cries somebody else, jostling Mr.
Kerr Mudgeon on the opposite ribs.</p>

<p>Still Kerr Mudgeon struggles through the press, resolved
upon obtaining his letters before other people obtain their
letters, having his feet trampled almost to a mummy, his
garments disarranged, if not torn, and in addition to bruises,
perhaps losing his fifty dollar breast-pin, to complete the
harmony of the picture; but still obtaining his letters in
advance of his competitors&mdash;five minutes saved or thereabouts&mdash;what
triumph! what a victory! To be sure, after
such a struggle, Mr. Kerr Mudgeon consumes much more
than the five minutes in putting himself to rights, and finds
himself in a towering passion for an hour or two, besides
groaning for a considerable length of time over his bruises
and his losses, all of which might have been escaped by a
few moments of patience. But then the victory&mdash;"you
won't, won't you?" Was Kerr Mudgeon ever baffled by any
species of resistance? Not he.</p>

<p>"People are such brutes," says he; "no more manners
than so many pigs&mdash;try not to let me get my letters as soon
as any of them, will they? I'll teach 'em that a Kerr Mudgeon
is not to be trifled with&mdash;just as good a right to be
first as anybody; and I will be first, wherever I go, cost
what it may."</p>

<p>We do not know that Kerr Mudgeon ever entered into a
calculation as to the profit and loss of the operation of the
rule that governed his life in intercourse with society. Indeed,
we rather think not. But it is probable that in the
long run, it costs as much as it comes to, if it does not cost
a great deal more, thus to persist in having one's way in
everything. In crossing the street now, when the black and
fluent mire is particularly abundant, Mr. Kerr Mudgeon insists
upon the flagstones&mdash;"as good a right as anybody,"
and thus pushes others into a predicament unpleasant to

<!-- page 75 -->

their boots and detrimental to their blacking, so that their
understandings become clouded, as they lose all their polish.
In general, such a course as this does very well&mdash;but it will
sometimes happen, as it has happened, that two Kerr Mudgeons
meet&mdash;the hardest fend off&mdash;and thus our Kerr Mudgeon
is toppled full length into a bed much more soft than
is altogether desirable, which vexes him.</p>

<p>Did you, of a rainy day, ever see Kerr Mudgeon incline
his umbrella to allow another umbrella to pass? We are
sure you never did. Kerr Mudgeon's umbrella is as good
as anybody's umbrella, and will maintain its dignity against
all comers, though it has been torn to fragments by the sharp
points of other umbrellas, which thought themselves quite
as good as it could pretend to be&mdash;and so, Kerr Mudgeon
got himself now and then into a fray, to say nothing of suits
for assault and battery, gracefully and agreeably interspersed.
Ho! ho! umbrellas!&mdash;"you won't, won't you?"</p>

<p>Kerr Mudgeon walks with a cane&mdash;carries it horizontally
under his arm, muddy at the ferule, perchance; and canes
thus disposed, come awkwardly in contact with the crossing
currents of persons and costumes. But what does he care
for the soiled garments of the ladies or the angry countenances
of offended gentlemen? Is not Kerr Mudgeon with
his cane, as good as anybody else and his cane? Horizontally&mdash;he
will wear it so. That's his way.</p>

<p>"The world don't improve at all,"" cries Kerr Mudgeon.
"They may make speeches about it, and pass resolutions
by the bushel; but it is my opinion that it grows obstinater
and obstinater every day. It never yields an inch, and a
man has to push, and to scramble, and to fight for ever to
make any headway for himself&mdash;black and blue more than
half the time. Every day shoots up all over rumpuses and
rowses. But, never mind&mdash;the world needn't flatter itself
that it's a going to conquer Kerr Mudgeon and put him
down too, as it does other people. Kerr Mudgeon knows
his rights&mdash;Kerr Mudgeon is as good as anybody else. Kerr

<!-- page 76 -->

Mudgeon will fight till he dies. He was never made to
yield, so long as his name is Kerr Mudgeon. It's a good
name&mdash;never disgraced by movements of the knuckle-down
character, and I am determined to carry on the war just as
all the Mudgeons did that went before me. If a horse kicks
me, I'll kick him back; and I wouldn't get out of the way,
like Mr. Daniel Tucker in the song, if a thirty-two pound
shot was coming up the street, or a locomotive was a
whizzin' down the road. Stand up straight&mdash;that's my
motto. Give 'em as good as they can bring; that's the
doctrine; and while a single bit of Kerr Mudgeon remains&mdash;while
any of his bones hang together, that's him squaring
off right in the centre of the track, ready for you, with his
coat buttoned up and a fist in each of his hands."</p>

<p>Kerr Mudgeon's face is settled grimly into the aspect of
habitual defiance. His brows are for ever knitting, not socks
or mittens, but frowns, and his mouth is knotted like a rope.
When he looks around, it seems to be an inquiry as to
whether any gentleman present is disposed to pugilistic encounter&mdash;if
so, he can be accommodated; and the whole
disposition of his garments indicates contention&mdash;war to
the knife.</p>

<p>Kerr Mudgeon complains that he has no friends, and is
beginning to stand solitary and alone, with but a dreary
prospect before him, in a world that grows "obstinater and
obstinater every day;" and he has yet to learn, if such learning
should ever penetrate through the armor of hostility
wherewith he is begirt, that perhaps, if we desire to have a
smooth and easy time of it, we must ourselves begin by being
smooth and easy. The belligerent ever meets with belligerents.
There's no difficulty about that. There is a
sufficiency of war in every atmosphere, if you are disposed
to condense it upon yourself; and no one eager to enjoy the
pleasure, need wander far in search of quarrels. Kerr Mudgeon
finds them everywhere&mdash;"rumpuses and rowses"&mdash;But
it is a shrewd doubt whether one's general comfort is

<!-- page 77 -->

greatly promoted by the aggravation of rudeness. It is easier
to bend a little to inclement blasts, than to be snapped off
by perpendicular resistance&mdash;easier to go round an obstacle
than to destroy your temper, and your clothing, in the exhausting
effort to clamber over it, and it may be said of
every quarrel in which Kerr-Mudgeonism is engaged, that
probably both parties are at fault, though Kerr-Mudgeonism
is, in all likelihood, the responsible party.</p>

<p>Yet "you won't, won't you?" is a great temptation to combativeness
and destructiveness. Is it not, all ye people of
the Kerr-Mudgeon temperament?</p>

<p>A BORE, IN CHARCOAL.</p>

</div>

<p>THAT's a Bore!</p>

<p>Everybody has heard of bores&mdash;of an immense bore&mdash;an
intolerable bore, or an excruciating bore. The majority of
mankind do not require to be told what constitutes a bore.
The enlightenment of daily experience is sufficient for the
purpose. They learn by dint of sufferings, which, at school
and elsewhere&mdash;flogging it in&mdash;has long been regarded as
the best method of disseminating intelligence and of making
people smart. We, therefore, content ourselves with repeating&mdash;</p>

<p>That's a bore!</p>

<p>Not from the forest of Ardennes&mdash;quadrupedal and porcine.
It is neither Mirabeau nor William de la Marck&mdash;nor
yet is it a personal likeness, representative of each existing
bore, or of all the varieties of bore. Portraiture so comprehensive
is impossible. Regard it rather as the ideal of
Cruikshank&mdash;a type and a symbol, having reference to bores
at large&mdash;to "General Bore," of the combined forces, if we
may be permitted to furnish an available title to the fanciful
embodiment. We have, in truth, before us, a sketch of universal
boredom, condensed into a form, that when we speak
of bores, the whole matter may present itself, physically, to
the eye. So&mdash;</p>

<p>That's a bore!</p>

<p>A modern bore&mdash;descended possibly from the Roman
augurs, who bored in classic times. But, leaving the historical
and genealogical question to more learned arbitrament,

<!-- page 79 -->

it can not be disputed that the bore is of an ancient
race, perforating, as it were, in days beyond the flood, and
having now the whole earth as an inheritance. Such multitudes
of bores&mdash;and then so unkindly, too&mdash;unfilial and unthankful.
Was there ever bore&mdash;we do not believe it&mdash;a
bore, but of the lesser sort&mdash;a gimlet, simply&mdash;who could
be prevailed upon to acknowledge (candidly and honestly,
and with no blush of shame at the relationship) that he was
a downright bore, or anything of a bore? Never. Though
the fact that he is a bore be apparent as the sun at noonday,
still will he insist upon it&mdash;boring all the while, most likely&mdash;that
he is not now, that he never has been, that he never
can be, and never will be, a bore&mdash;as if, zoologically speaking,
a decided bore, born a bore and educated a bore, could
very well help being a bore. Bristle as he may, to be so accused,
yet he must be a bore; and the best he can do, if
there can be a best to the worst, is to cherish ambition in his
calling, to place it beyond the reach of controversy that
Linkum Fidelius is a tremendous bore&mdash;superlative&mdash;equal
to Brunel and the tunnel of the Thames.</p>

<p>But as the annals of confession afford no instance of pleading
guilty to a snore&mdash;nobody snores; though the s'norous
resonance may keep the watch from sleeping&mdash;so the peculiarity
of boring is broadly denied by its most persevering
practitioners. It is professed by none except by those who
bore the earth for Artesian wells, and by those who bore
their bills through whole houses of legislation.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, gentle reader, smile not too securely in scorn
of bores. What if it should be said that you are a bore&mdash;that
we are a bore&mdash;that all of us&mdash;everything and everybody&mdash;are
bores inevitably, at certain times and at certain
seasons. It is melancholy, but it is true, that be as amiable
and as fascinating as possibility will allow&mdash;and who more
delightful than yourself, or than ourself, when we choose to
set about it?&mdash;still, it is not to be disputed that there are
occasions when people&mdash;they, perchance, that love us best at

<!-- page 80 -->

other moments&mdash;will regard us both as bores&mdash;tiresomely,
and with a yawn&mdash;"Good gracious, what a bore;" or again,
querulous and fretful&mdash;"A shocking bore!" It has been so,
in word and in thought, has it not, with you? And there
are no exceptions to the rule, flatter yourself never so
much.</p>

<p>It is hydropathic, we must admit&mdash;Priessnitz, Graefenberg,
and all that sort of aquatic treatment, thus to be sluiced,
spiritually, with cold water, by hearing such outcry as we
close the door, or to read such thought&mdash;the board have an
expression&mdash;in neighbor faces as we rise to go. After all
our efforts&mdash;after this deal of trouble in what we regard as
our irresistible style of conversational operation&mdash;after so
much care in costume (did we ever look so well?)&mdash;so much
grace in attitude, moreover&mdash;topics, besides, so judiciously
selected, and we so full of wit and poignancy; and then to
discover&mdash;worse than annihilation!&mdash;that it is boring we
have been, from first to last!&mdash;and that while we proudly
hoped to gain all hearts, people were inquiring of themselves
"when will he go?" coupled with unexpressed desires that
you were in safe deposite at "Jericho," or borne away to a
further remoteness. From this, observe ye, the uninitiated
may understand what is meant by a "sinking in poetry."
It is bathos realized and brought home in the utilitarian
sense. To speak of "feeling flat," is descriptive enough of
what humanity endures at an ordinary "flash in the pan."
When a joke snaps, and people sit in dismayed silence at
your inexplicable audacity&mdash;"what did he mean?"&mdash;while
your cheeks are tingling&mdash;or when young gentlemen break
down suddenly in an effort at dashing ease and elegance&mdash;flatness
is frequent and familiar; but to be thus hurled from
the topmost summit of complacent self-esteem, is a Tarpeian
fall that makes a hollow in the ground, depressing far beyond
the flat.</p>

<p>But grumble not&mdash;these are results which are not always
to be avoided. The best of people, beaming in beauty or

<!-- page 81 -->

sparkling with wit&mdash;even our friendships, and not excluding
loves&mdash;yea, more attractive than all these, in the preference
yielded to indispensables over the luxuries of existence&mdash;the
very call to dinner, tap, tap, in the midst of our employment&mdash;if
coming at the unpropitious time&mdash;are bores, just
then. Who are not bores, when gentlemen have something
else to do, or when the lady is surprised in "wrappers"&mdash;when
you wish to dress, or have engagements more
attractive?</p>

<p>Be content. There is no complete emancipation from
boredom&mdash;from boring, or from being bored; and our wisdom
teaches to balance one against the other, submitting
patiently; or, in a more revengeful spirit, setting forth relentless,
to inflict on others the same species of calamity that
has been administered to you.</p>

<p>It is well, however, to refine perception, so that it may be
discovered in the features of the sufferers&mdash;you could not
well feel pulses&mdash;when they have had as much as constitution
will enable them to bear. Note their writhings, and
be as merciful as can be afforded. It is economic, also:
people once bored to death are beyond reach, to be bored
no more; but if allowed to escape before complete inanition
is induced, one may call again to-morrow, to practise on the
victim. Note when the "boree" fidgets in its chair, playing
with books or twiddling with its darling little thumbs&mdash;adjusting
lights which do not need adjustment&mdash;vague in answer,
or abstract in look&mdash;with remarks apart, which bear
not on the question&mdash;with awful pause, spasmodically broken
by "How's your uncle, or your aunt?" or, "When did
you see Jones?"&mdash;when it comes to this&mdash;there!&mdash;you'd
better go&mdash;it is "suffigeance" now; and it maybe homicide,
if more protracted. It is folly when such discoveries
are made&mdash;that boredom has reached its climax&mdash;to sit
hour after hour in nervous meditation on retreat, as you have,
yet fearing the attempt, as you often do. Vanish, gracefully
or disgracefully. "Stand not," as Lady Macbeth judiciously

<!-- page 82 -->

remarked, when bored that her husband misbehaved before
the tea-party&mdash;"stand not on the order of your going, but
go at once." It is useless&mdash;who has not tried it?&mdash;to wait
until incident occurs to afford facility for retirement, unless
there is boldness enough to elbow something over that will
break. Nor can reliance for a start be placed on any but
ourselves; for how often is it found that each is waiting for
the other, and that a single move dissolves the whole array?
In vain&mdash;the boys, vociferous enough at other times, are not
disposed to raise alarms of fire for your accommodation; and
we do not know that earthquakes come by wishing for a
shock.</p>

<p>When thoughts like these are springing to the mind,
it admits not of question&mdash;we are boring terribly; and if
no better way suggests itself, it is wise to faint at once, that
we may be carried out&mdash;the open air will do us good. Set
it in a note-book, that whenever it is felt that our chair and
ourselves are becoming one and indivisible&mdash;that we would
rejoice to escape if we had hardihood for the deed, but that
escape becomes more awkward and impracticable as the
time wears on, then are we bores upon the larger scale, fit to
be used in pump construction. Then, should our literary
researches be confined to Xenophon and the retreat of the
ten thousand, or to the study of Moreau in the Black forest.
How got the French away from Moscow?</p>

<p>But not to drive any one to despair as an irremediable
bore&mdash;we should regret to hear of an unusual recourse to
pistols, cord, or poisons, following close upon the promulgation
of this boring article&mdash;not then to induce summary
methods of shuffling coils, with smooth bore or with rifle,
it affords pleasure to add that there is hope of redemption
for those who are yet capable of feeling the sensations which
we have thus imperfectly attempted to describe. They are
accidental bores&mdash;involuntary&mdash;and without malice prepense.
They have compunctious visitings afterward&mdash;they
call themselves hard names&mdash;dolt, perhaps, or booby&mdash;in

<!-- page 83 -->

returning home&mdash;"how could I?"&mdash;and in disrobing them
for bed, each silliness, real or supposed, that they may have
uttered&mdash;each folly of excitement&mdash;each <i>platitude</i>&mdash;verging
on the green, or tending to the soft&mdash;that has been perpetrated,
rises up remorseful&mdash;spectre-like and in gigantic
exaggeration&mdash;to self-accusing eyes.&mdash;If we had not said
this, or if we had not done that&mdash;if we had retired in only
tolerable time, or could have comprehended the suppressed
irony that induced us "not to be in a hurry," when it had
already been proved, to a very great extent, that we were
not in a hurry, by any manner of means. The gapings, too&mdash;checked,
but yet perceptible&mdash;unnoticed, but remembered&mdash;how
well we understand them now!&mdash;"Alas, gosling,
goose, and gander, that I am, to have taken compliment
for reality, and to have 'walked in, won't you,' when 'walk
off' was the true translation of the phrase!" and Borem
buries his head in the pillow, as if it were possible when
bored by one's self&mdash;the worst of all possible bores&mdash;to
get rid of one's self, by any practicable process.</p>

<p>To such as these, as before announced, there is hope of
redemption. But what may be called the "Bore Proper"&mdash;the
bore ingrain&mdash;he who does it a purpose, and, as it
were, makes a living at it, thinking that the world rejoices
in him and would not have it otherwise, he is fit only for the
Hospital of Incurables, and must be given up.</p>

<p>But now let us make inquiries, on the score of humanity
and benevolence, as to</p>

<p>Who bores?</p>

<p>What bores?</p>

<p>The one idea is exceedingly apt to bore&mdash;a single barrelled
bore shoots close&mdash;as, for instance, when you see
him coming, and know to an exactitude the very thing he
will talk about, endeavoring, for the hundredth time, to afford
enlightenment on a subject we already understand, or relative
to which we care not the value of a button. That's a
bore, as it ambuscades us in the street, or trenches upon

<!-- page 84 -->

time intended for other purposes. It is prudent, therefore,
to be chary and watchful of your one idea. However important
it may seem to its possessor, other folks may have a
different bias, and are not likely to desire to trot far upon any
hobby-horse but their own; and so philosophers, politicians,
philanthropists, inventors, speculators, and innovators, of
every description and degree, are all given more or less to
boring. And though politeness may seem to feel an interest,
it is a fair presumption, more than half the time, that politeness
is not to be believed. We are obliged to politeness
always, for its sacrifices, but have little faith in its complaisance.
It may say "bore," when we are gone&mdash;it does so
generally.</p>

<p>Self&mdash;how delicious to chatter of one's self!&mdash;delicious,
but full of danger&mdash;self, then, as a theme for speeches, is, in
the most of cases, quite boreal&mdash;hyperboreal&mdash;other selves
being present, each one of which prefers itself to every other
self, and only listens to yourself, that, on the reciprocity
principle, it may afterward be permitted to talk of itself.
Try to remember that all these people round about, are
selves of their own, complete and perfect in their individuality,
and that as they are to you, so are you to them&mdash;simply
an external circumstance&mdash;a shadow and an accident.
If you catch yourself talking of yourself, recollect yourself
before you commit yourself, and ask yourself how you would
like it, if yourself were bored after this fashion. It is hard,
undoubtedly; but it is necessary to learn how to put yourself
in your pocket.</p>

<p>"The shop"&mdash;mind the shop&mdash;is assuredly a bore, if
much of the shop be offered. We all have shops, of one
kind or of another, which, in the main, is quite enough; and
few there are who care much to be indoctrinated with the
particulars of the circumjacent shops. When leaving the
shop, then, let us be sure that all appertaining to the shop
is also left. In society, the gentleman&mdash;and not to be a
bore is essential to that coveted character&mdash;is one who volunteers

<!-- page 85 -->

no evidence of his avocation. He talks not of bullocks&mdash;prates
not of physic or of surgery&mdash;refrains from
cotton, and leaves his stocks in the money-market, except
briefly and in reply to question&mdash;and for the plain reason
that he is aware that others have shops&mdash;that they love their
shops as much as he loves his shop, and that if shops are to
be lugged in, why not their shops as well as his shop?&mdash;While
thus "sinking the shop," it may be taken rather as
an ill compliment to be questioned much about the shop,
there being reason to suspect that an imagination exists that
you can talk of nothing else but the shop. Think of it by
day&mdash;dream of it, if you will, by night&mdash;and above all,
attend to it industriously; but do not take it with you into
other people's houses.</p>

<p>We might perhaps keep boring on, like Signor Benedict,
who would still be talking&mdash;that was a bore&mdash;when nobody
heeded him&mdash;for these general charges admit of minute
specification. We could speak of invalid bores, who find
delight in the recapitulation of sufferings; who dote on the
doctor, and who bore for sympathy when there is none to
spare, and as if none were hurt but them&mdash;of melancholy
bores, who seek to draw a funeral veil across the joyous day&mdash;of
misanthropic bores, who sulk and groan&mdash;of argumentative
bores&mdash;combative and disputatious&mdash;who can not
acquiesce, and must contest each point, in a war of posts, with
armor ever on&mdash;of literary bores, who lend you books, and
after catechize, to see that you have read them&mdash;be sure at
least to cut the leaves before you send the volume back&mdash;of
oratorical bores, who practise speeches and grind logic
on you&mdash;of the bore critical, who would better all things,
and of the bore grammatical, who parses what you say&mdash;of
bores too formal and the bore familiar. But it all resolves
itself to this&mdash;that he who talks only to please himself, like
him who sings or whistles at your elbow, is tending boreward,
engrossed in his own gratification, and that the truly kind
and considerate are not apt to bore, except by accident. A

<!-- page 86 -->

little thought, and they will know what to talk about, and
when to leave off talking; while the opinionated and the
selfish will persist in boring&mdash;for they lack perception and
benevolence; and perhaps, as a general rule, it may be set
down, paradoxically, and differing from guns, that</p>

<p class="center">THE GREATEST BORES HAVE THE SMALLEST CALIBRE.</p>

<p>LOOK AT THE CLOCK:</p>

<p class="small">OR, A PRETTY TIME OF NIGHT.</p>

</div>

<p>"TINKLE!"</p>

<p>There are people, of the imaginative sort, who undertake
to judge of people's character from people's hand of write,
pretending to obtain glimpses of the individual's distinctive
traits through the rectilinear and curvilinear processes of
that individual's pen; and we shall not, for "our own poor
part," undertake to deny that "idiosyncracy," meaning
thereby the mental and physical peculiarities of our nature,
may be discoverable in whatever we do, if there were wit
enough to find it out. We are probably pervaded by a style
as much our own and none of our neighbor's, as the style
of our nose, making each man, each woman, and each child,
himself, herself, and itself, alone; and perhaps the time may
come, if it be not here already, when the wise ones&mdash;professors
and so forth&mdash;will be able to discover from a glimpse
of our thumbs, what we are likely to prefer for dinner. Indeed,
we know it to be theoretical in certain schools&mdash;in
the kitchen, for instance, which is the most orthodox and
sensible of the schools&mdash;that, as a general rule, the leading
features of character are indicated by the mode in which we
pull a bell, and that, to a considerable extent, we may infer
the kind of person who is at the door&mdash;just as we do the
kind of fish that bobs the cork&mdash;by the species of vibration
which is given to the wire. Rash, impetuous, choleric, and
destructive, what chance has the poor little bell in such
hands? But the considerate, modest, lowly, and retiring&mdash;do
you ever know such people to break things? Depend

<!-- page 88 -->

upon it, too, that our self-estimate is largely indicated by our
conduct in this respect. If it does not betray what we really
are, it most assuredly discloses the temper of the mind at
the moment of our ringing.</p>

<p>"Tinkle!"</p>

<p>Did you hear?</p>

<p>Nothing could be more amiable or unobtrusive than that.
It would scarcely disturb the nervous system of a mouse;
and whoever listened to it, might at once understand that it
was the soft tintinnabulary whisper of a gentleman of the
convivial turn and of the "locked out" description, who,
conscious probably of default, is desirous of being admitted
to his domiciliary comforts upon the most pacific and silent
terms that can be obtained from those who hold the citadel
and possess the inside of the door.</p>

<p>"Tinkle!"</p>

<p>Who can doubt that he&mdash;Mr. Tinkle&mdash;would take off his
boots and go up stairs in his stocking-feet, muttering rebuke
to every step that creaked? What a deprecating mildness
there is in the deportment of the "great locked out!" How
gently do they tap, and how softly do they ring; while, perchance,
in due proportion to their enjoyment in untimely and
protracted revel, is the penitential aspect of their return.
There is a "never-do-so-any-more-ishness" all about them&mdash;yea&mdash;even
about the bully boys "who wouldn't go home
till morning&mdash;till daylight does appear," singing up to the
very door; and when they</p>

<p>"Tinkle!"</p>

<p>It is intended as a hint merely and not as a broad annunciation&mdash;insinuated&mdash;not
proclaimed aloud&mdash;that somebody
who is very sorry&mdash;who "didn't go to help it," and
all that&mdash;is at the threshold, and that if it be the same to
you, he would be exceeding glad to come in, with as little
of scolding and rebuke as may be thought likely to answer
the purpose. There is a hope in it&mdash;a subdued hope&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tinkle!"</p>

<!-- page 89 -->

<p>&mdash;that perchance a member of the family&mdash;good-natured
as well as insomnolent&mdash;may be spontaneously awake, and
disposed to open the door without clamoring up Malcolm,
Donalbain, and the whole house. Why should every one
know? But&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tinkle&mdash;tankle!!"</p>

<p>Even patience itself&mdash;on a damp, chilly, unwholesome
night&mdash;patience at the street-door, all alone by itself and
disposed to slumber&mdash;as patience is apt to be after patience
has been partaking of potations and of collations&mdash;even patience
itself can not be expected to remain tinkling there&mdash;"pianissimo"&mdash;hour
after hour, as if there were nothing
else in this world worthy of attention but the ringing of
bells. Who can be surprised that patience at last becomes
reckless and desperate, let the consequences&mdash;rhinoceroses
or Hyrcan tigers&mdash;assume what shape they may?</p>

<p>There is a furious stampede upon the marble&mdash;a fierce
word or two of scathing Saxon, and then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Rangle&mdash;ja-a-a-ngle&mdash;ra-a-a-ng!!!"&mdash;the sound being
of that sharp, stinging, excruciating kind, which leads
to the conclusion that somebody is "worse" and is getting
in a rage.</p>

<p>That one, let me tell you, was Mr. Dawson Dawdle, in
whom wrath had surmounted discretion, and who, as a forlorn
hope, had now determined to make good his entrance&mdash;assault,
storm, escalade&mdash;at any hazard and at any cost.
Dawson Dawdle was furious now&mdash;"savagerous"&mdash;as you
have been, probably, when kept at the door till your teeth
rattled like castinets and cachuchas.</p>

<p>Passion is picturesque in attitude, as well as poetic in expression.
Dawson Dawdle braced his feet one on each side
of the door-post, as a purchase, and tugged at the bell with
both hands, until windows flew up in all directions, and
nightcapped heads, in curious variety, were projected into
the gloom. Something seemed to be the matter at Dawdle's.</p>

<p>"Who's sick?" cried one.</p>

<!-- page 90 -->

<p>"Where's the fire?" asked another.</p>

<p>"The Mexicans are come!" shouted a third. But Dawson
Dawdle had reached that state of intensity which is
regardless of every consideration but that of the business in
hand, and he continued to pull away, as if at work by the
job, while several observing watchmen stood by in admiration
of his zeal. Yet there was no answer to this pealing
appeal for admittance&mdash;not that Mrs. Dawson Dawdle was
deaf&mdash;not she&mdash;nor dumb either. Nay, she had recognised
Mr. Dawdle's returning step&mdash;that husband's "foot," which
should, according to the poet&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"Have music in't<br/>

As he comes up the stair."</p>

<p>But Dawdle was allowed to make his music in the street,
while his wife, obdurate, listened with a smile bordering, we
fear, a little upon exultation, at his progressive lessons and
rapid improvements in the art of ringing "triple-bob-majors."</p>

<p>"Let him wait," remarked Mrs. Dawson Dawdle; "let
him wait&mdash;'twill do him good. I'm sure I've been waiting
long enough for him."</p>

<p>And so she had; but, though there be a doubt whether
this process of waiting had "done good" in her own case,
yet if there be truth or justice in the vengeful practice which
would have us act toward others precisely as they deport
themselves to us&mdash;and every one concedes that it is very
agreeable, however wrong, to carry on the war after this
fashion&mdash;Mrs. Dawson Dawdle could have little difficulty
in justifying herself for the course adopted.</p>

<p>Only to think of it, now.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dawson Dawdle is one of those natural and proper
people who become sleepy of evenings, and who are rather
apt to yawn after tea. Mr. Dawson Dawdle, on the other
hand, is of the unnatural and improper species, who are not
sleepy or yawny of evenings&mdash;never so, except of mornings.
Dawson insists on it, that he is no chicken to go to roost at

<!-- page 91 -->

sundown; while Mrs. Dawson Dawdle rises with the lark.
The larks he prefers, are larks at night. Now, as a corrective
to these differences of opinion, Dawson Dawdle had
been cunningly deprived of his pass-key, that he might be
induced "to remember not to forget" to come home betimes&mdash;a
thing he was not apt to remember, especially if good
companionship intervened.</p>

<p>Thus, Mrs. Dawdle was "waiting up" for him.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>To indulge in an episode here, <i>apropos</i> to the general
principle involved, it may be said, pertinently enough, that
this matter of waiting, if you have nerves&mdash;"waiting up,"
or "waiting down," choose either branch of the dilemma&mdash;is
not to be ranged under the head of popular amusements,
or classified in the category of enlivening recreation. To
wait&mdash;who has not waited?&mdash;fix it as we will&mdash;is always
more or less of a trial; and whether the arrangement be for
"waiting up"&mdash;disdainful of sleep&mdash;or for "waiting down"&mdash;covetous
of dozes&mdash;it rarely happens that the intervals
are employed in the invocation of other than left-handed
blessings, on the head of those who have caused this deviation
from comfortable routine; or that, on their tardy arrival&mdash;people
conscious of being waited for, always stay out as
long and as provokingly as they can&mdash;we find ourselves at
all disposed to amiable converse, or complimentary expression.</p>

<p>And reason good. If we lie down, for instance, when my
young lady has gone to a "polka party," or my young gentleman
has travelled away to an affair of the convivialities,
do we ever find it conducive to refreshing repose, this awkward
consciousness, overpending like the sword of Damocles,
that sooner or later the disturbance must come, to call us
startingly from dreams? Nor after we have tossed and
tumbled into a lethargy, is it to be set down as a pleasure to
be aroused, all stupid and perplexed, to scramble down the
stairway for the admission of delinquents, who&mdash;the fact

<!-- page 92 -->

admits of no exception&mdash;ring, ring, ring, or knock, knock,
knock away, long after you have heard them, and persist in
goading you to phrensies, by peal upon peal, when your very
neck is endangered by rapidity of movement in their behalf.
It is a lucky thing for them when they so ungratefully ask,
"why you didn't make haste," as they always do, or mutter
about being "kept there all night," as they surely will, that
despotic powers are unknown in these regions, and that you
are not invested with supreme command. But now get thee
to sleep again, as quickly as thou canst, though it may be
that the task is not the easiest in the world.</p>

<p>"Waiting up," too, this likewise has its delectations. The
very clock seems at last to have entered into the conspiracy&mdash;the
hands move with sluggish weariness, and there is a
laggard sound in the swinging of the pendulum, which almost
says that time itself is tired, as it ticks its progress to the
drowsy ear. There is a bustle in the street, no doubt, as you
sit down doggedly to wakefulness: and many feet are pattering
from theatre and circus. For a time the laugh is
heard, and people chatter as they pass, boy calling unto boy,
or deep-mouthed men humming an untuned song. Now
doors are slammed, and shutters closed, and bolts are shooting,
in earnest of retirements for the night. Forsaken dogs
bark round and round the house, and vocal cats beset the
portico. The rumbling of the hack dwindles in the distance,
as the cabs roll by from steamboat wharf and railroad depot.
You are deserted and alone&mdash;tired of book, sated with newspaper,
indisposed to thought. You nod&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;bibetty
bobetty!&mdash;as your hair smokes and crackles in the lamp.
But it is folly now to peep forth. Will they never come?
No&mdash;do they ever, until all reasonable patience is exhausted?
Yes&mdash;here they are!&mdash;pshaw!&mdash;sit thee still&mdash;it is but a
straggling step; and hour drags after hour, until you have
resolved it o'er and o'er again, that this shall be the last of
your vigils, let who will request it as a favor, that you will
be good enough to sit up for them. I wouldn't do it.</p>

<!-- page 93 -->

<p>So it is not at all to be marvelled at that Mrs. Dawson
Dawdle&mdash;disposed, as we know her to be, to sleepiness at
times appropriate to sleep&mdash;was irate at the nonappearance
of Mr. Dawson Dawdle, or that, after he had reached home,
she detained him vengefully at the street-door, as an example
to such dilatoriness in general, for it is a prevailing fault in
husbandry, and that, in particular, being thus kept out considerably
longer than he wished to keep out&mdash;too much of a
good thing being good for nothing&mdash;he might be taught
better, on the doctrine of curing an evil by aggravation&mdash;both
were aggravated.</p>

<p>But the difficulty presents itself here, that Mr. Dawson
Dawdle has a constitutional defect, beyond reach of the
range of ordinary remedial agents. Being locked out, is
curative to some people, for at least a time&mdash;till they forget
it, mostly. But Dawson Dawdle is the man who is always
too late&mdash;he must be too late&mdash;he would not know himself
if he were not too late&mdash;it would not be he, if he were not
too late. Too late is to him a matter of course&mdash;a fixed result
in his nature. He had heard of "soon," and he believed
that perhaps there might occasionally be something of the
sort&mdash;spasmodic and accidental&mdash;but, for his own part, he
had never been there himself. And as for "too soon," he
regarded it as imaginative altogether&mdash;an incredibility.
The presumption is, that he must have been born an hour
or so too late, and that he had never been able to make up
the difference. In fact, Dawson Dawdle is a man to be relied
on&mdash;no mistake as to Dawson Dawdle. Whenever he
makes an appointment, you are sure he will not keep it,
which saves a deal of trouble on your side of the question;
and at the best, if an early hour be set, any time will answer
in the latter part of the day. Dawson Dawdle forgets, too:
how complimentary it is to be told that engagements in which
we are involved are so readily forgotten! Leave it to the
Dawdles to forget; and never double the affront by an excuse
that transcends the original offence. Or else Dawson

<!-- page 94 -->

Dawdle did not know it was so late; and yet Dawson might
have been sure of it. When was it otherwise than late with
the late Mr. Dawson Dawdle?</p>

<p>"Well," said he, at the bell-handle all this time, "well,
I suppose it's late again&mdash;it rings as if it was late; and
somehow or other, it appears to me that it always is late,
especially and particularly when my wife tells me to be sure
to be home early&mdash;'you, Dawson, come back soon, d'ye
hear?' and all that sort o' thing. I wish she wouldn't&mdash;it
puts me out, to keep telling me what I ought to do; and
when I have to remember to come home early, it makes me
forget all about it, and discomboberates my ideas so that
I'm a great deal later than I would be if I was left to my
own sagacity. Let me alone, and I'm great upon sagacity;
but yet what is sagacity when it has no key and the dead-latch
is down? What chance has sagacity got when sagacity's
wife won't let sagacity in? I'll have another pull at the
bell&mdash;exercise is good for one's health."</p>

<p>This last peal&mdash;as peals, under such circumstances, are
apt to be&mdash;was louder, more sonorous, and in all respects
more terrific, than any of its "illustrious predecessors,"
practice in this respect tending to the improvement of skill
on the one hand, just as its adds provocation to temper on
the other. For a moment, the fate of Dawson Dawdle
quivered in the scale, as the eye of his exasperated lady
glanced fearfully round the room for a means of retaliation
and redress. Nay, her hand rested for an instant upon a
pitcher, while thoughts of hydropathies, douches, shower-baths,
Graefenbergs, and Priessnitzes, in their medicinal
application to dilatory husbands, presented themselves in
quick aquatic succession like the rushings of a cataract.
Never did man come nearer to being drowned than Mr.
Dawson Dawdle.</p>

<p>"But no," said she, relenting; "if he were to ketch his
death o' cold, he'd be a great deal more trouble than he is
now&mdash;husbands with bad colds&mdash;coughing husbands and

<!-- page 95 -->

sneezing husbands&mdash;are the stupidest and tiresomest kind
of husbands&mdash;bad as they may be, ducking don't improve
'em. I'll have recourse to moral suasion; and if that won't
answer, I'll duck him afterward."</p>

<p>Suddenly and in the midst of a protracted jangle, the door
flew widely open, and displayed the form of Mrs. Dawson
Dawdle, standing sublime&mdash;silent&mdash;statuesque&mdash;wrapped
in wrath and enveloped in taciturnity. Dawdle was appalled.</p>

<p>"My dear!" and his hand dropped nervelessly from the
bell-handle, "my dear, it's me&mdash;only me."</p>

<p>Not a word of response to the tender appeal&mdash;the lady
remained obdurate in silence&mdash;chilly and voiceless as the
marble, with her eyes sternly fixed upon the intruder. Dawson
Dawdle felt himself running down.</p>

<p>"My dear&mdash;he! he!" and Dawson laughed with a melancholy
quaver&mdash;"it's me that's come home&mdash;you know me&mdash;it's
late, I confess&mdash;it's most always late&mdash;and I&mdash;ho!
ho!&mdash;why don't you say something, Mrs. Dawson Dawdle?&mdash;Do
you think I'm going to be skeered, Mrs. Dawdle?"</p>

<p>As the parties thus confronted each other, Mrs. Dawdle's
"masterly inactivity" proved overwhelming. For reproaches,
Dawson was prepared&mdash;he could bear part in a war of opinion&mdash;the
squabble is easy to most of us&mdash;but where are we
when the antagonise will not deign to speak, and environs
us, as it were, in an ambuscade, so that we fear the more because
we know not what to fear?</p>

<p>"Why don't she blow me up?" queried Dawdle to himself,
as he found his valor collapsing&mdash;"why don't she blow
me up like an affectionate woman and a loving wife, instead
of standing there in that ghostified fashion?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Dawdle's hand slowly extended itself toward the
culprit, who made no attempt at evasion or defence&mdash;slowly
it entwined itself in the folds of his neck-handkerchief,
and, as the unresisting Dawson had strange fancies relative
to bow-strings, he found himself drawn inward by a sure
and steady grasp. Swiftly was he sped through the darksome

<!-- page 96 -->

entry and up the winding stair, without a word to comfort
him in his stumbling progress.</p>

<p>"Dawson Dawdle!&mdash;Look at the clock!&mdash;A pretty time
of night, indeed, and you a married man. Look at the clock,
I say, and see."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dawson Dawdle, however, had, for the moment, lost
her advantage in thus giving utterance to her emotion; and
Mr. Dawson Dawdle, though much shaken, began to recover
his spirits.</p>

<p>"Two o'clock, Mr. Dawdle&mdash;two!&mdash;isn't it two, I ask you?"</p>

<p>"If you are positive about the fact, Mrs. Dawdle, it would
be unbecoming in me to call your veracity in question, and
I decline looking. So far as I am informed, it generally is
two o'clock just about this time in the morning&mdash;at least,
it always has been whenever I stayed up to see. If the clock
is right, you'll be apt to find it two just as it strikes two&mdash;that's
the reason it strikes, and I don't know that it could
have a better reason."</p>

<p>"A pretty time!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;pretty enough," responded Dawdle; "when it
don't rain, one time of night is as pretty as another time of
night&mdash;it's the people that's up in the time of night, that's
not pretty; and you, Mrs. Dawdle, are a case in pint&mdash;keeping
a man out of his own house. It's not the night
that's not pretty, Mrs. Dawdle, but the goings-on, that's not&mdash;and
you are the goings-on. As for me, I'm for peace&mdash;a
dead-latch key and peace; and I move that the goings-on
be indefinitely postponed, because, Mrs. Dawdle, I've heard
it all before&mdash;I know it like a book; and if you insist on it,
Mrs. Dawdle, I'll save you trouble, and speak the whole
speech for you right off the reel, only I can't cry good when
I'm jolly."</p>

<p>But Dawson Dawdle's volubility, assumed for the purpose
of hiding his own misgivings, did not answer the end which he
had in view; for Mrs. Dawson Dawdle, having had a glimpse
at its effects, again resorted to the "silent system" of connubial

<!-- page 97 -->

management. She spoke no more that night, which
Dawson, perchance, found agreeable enough. But she
would not speak any more the day after, which perplexed
him when he came down too late for breakfast, or returned
too late for dinner.</p>

<p>"I do wish she would say something," muttered Dawdle;
"something cross, if she likes&mdash;anything, so it makes a
noise. It makes a man feel bad, after he's used to being
talked to, not to be talked to in the regular old-fashioned
way. When one's so accustomed to being blowed up, it
seems as if he was lost or didn't belong to anybody, if no
one sees to it that he's blowed up at the usual time. Bachelors,
perhaps, can get along well enough without having
their comforts properly attended to in this respect.&mdash;What
do they know, the miserable creatures, about such warm
receptions, and such little endearments? When they are
out too late, nobody's at home preparing a speech for them;
but I feel just as if I was a widower, if I'm not talked to for
not being at home in time."</p>

<p>So Dawson Dawdle was thus impelled to efforts at reform,
because his defaults and his deficiencies could elicit no rebuke
but that of an impenetrable silence; and, in consequence,
he has of late been several times almost in time, and
he begins to hope that he may be in time yet before he dies.</p>

<p>As for Mrs. Dawson Dawdle, whose example is commended
to whom it may concern, she has adopted the "silent
system" of discipline, as a part of her domestic economy.
She says nothing. Talk as she may when Dawdle is from
home, he must be a good Dawdle&mdash;a love of a Dawdle&mdash;to
induce her to the use of her tongue when he is about the
house. The intensity of the silence announces to him how
far he has offended; and the only notice now that is accorded
to his errors in the computation of hours and minutes,
is the hand upon the neck-handkerchief, and that solemn
and startling request before alluded to, which invites him to</p>

<p class="center">"LOOK AT THE CLOCK!"</p>

<div class="center" id="b2ch09">

<p>SHERRIE KOBLER:</p>

<p class="small">OR, A SEARCH AFTER FUN.</p>

</div>

<p>SHERRIE KOBLER, did you say?</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;Sherrie Kobler. The name, of course, strikes you
as familiar; and if it has been your fortune to be much
"about," as the phrase goes, in the bustling scenes of a gay
metropolis, it is more than probable that you have, more or
less, had the pleasure of forming an acquaintance with the
illustrious individual&mdash;Sherrie Kobler&mdash;to whom we now
refer.</p>

<p>But let us be respectful to a colossal genius of the times,
and accord to him all the typographical extension to which
his worth is entitled. Leave it to cotemporaneous levity to
curtail men's names of fair proportion, and to stab at dignity
by the vile processes of that abbreviation which terms you
Pick, and calls me Tom, as if we were too slight and insignificant
to have ourselves spelt out in full. Sheridan Kobler,
with all its longitude&mdash;at least, in the preliminaries of introduction,
however much we may fall into the vulgar custom
as we proceed in narrative&mdash;Sheridan Kobler, then, is
a personage of intrinsic force; and, though bearing the
name of a wit, a statesman, a dramatist, and a <i>bon vivant</i>,
he is one of the precious few who have proved themselves
equal to their prenomen, and have been at all able to realize
the promise held out by the error of their parents. The
paths of distinction lie comparatively open to your Sams,
your Bens, and your Abrahams&mdash;but if the name be ambitious&mdash;borrowed,
as it were, from the memory of departed
greatness&mdash;a double load is imposed upon its unfortunate

<!-- page 99 -->

possessor, and he is doomed not only to work himself forward,
but likewise continually to provoke disadvantageous
comparison with him who has gone before; and hence it is
that this system of complimentary nomenclature has shown
itself so barren of results. It is, for the most part, the plain
name&mdash;the simple, unpresuming name&mdash;the name without
swagger, without dash, without complication&mdash;the name
awakening no recollections of antecedent glory&mdash;that buoys
itself upward into the ethereal regions of renown. But
Sheridan Kobler has that within which is superior to impediment,
and triumphant over obstacles&mdash;Sheridan Kobler is
an impulse and an energy; and if he had done nothing else
to entitle him to a world's admiration and remembrance, the
mere fact that he first prepared, combined, and imbibed, the
potation that bears his own title&mdash;Sherrie Kobler&mdash;would
be sufficient to find him a place in grateful mouths long
after the C&aelig;sars and Napoleons of the earth are forgotten.</p>

<p>Who&mdash;let us ask&mdash;who calls for them&mdash;who&mdash;thirsty
and impatient&mdash;cries aloud for a "Julius C&aelig;sar," or a "Napoleon
Bonaparte," to quench the fever of his frame? As
well might he seek refreshment in dust and ashes, as in
these, or cast himself in fiery furnaces, as ask the warrior's
aid in such extremity. But it is not thus with Sherrie Kobler&mdash;"a
Sherrie Kobler"&mdash;"two Sherrie Koblers"&mdash;"Sherrie
Koblers for six "&mdash;"keep bringing Sherrie Koblers"&mdash;there's
glory for you, in its broadest sense and in
its most extended compass; and so does Sherrie Kobler,
crowned with a decanter, roll onward to the unborn centuries,
cresting the "tenth wave" of imperishable renown.
"Jefferson shoes" and "Wellington boots"&mdash;their soles
and uppers&mdash;may pass into the realms of oblivion, as men
decay and fashions change. Where is now that tinct of
"Navarino smoke" which once enveloped beauty in its
silken folds; and where the "Talavera trowsers" that almost
showed how fields were won?&mdash;Gone&mdash;all gone&mdash;their
memory scarce remains in shops. Some newer incident

<!-- page 100 -->

usurps the place; and even the all sorts of "Lafayettes,"
that twenty years ago brought the "illustrious representative
of two hemispheres" so frequently to view, what, we
pray you, has become of them?&mdash;Ay&mdash;"so fades the glimmering
landscape on the sight;" and it is rare&mdash;if not
almost one of the impossibilities&mdash;so to impress ourselves
upon the minds of men that the image may escape erasure,
and that our memory shall remain as sharply cut and as
freshly carved as at first.</p>

<p>We do not propose, therefore, to fly, like an exasperated
hen, with contumelious boldness, into the wrinkled face of
the established experiences, in honor of our present hero,
the benignant Sherrie Kobler, of the nineteenth century. It
may be that he, too, must undergo the lot of our common
humanity and evaporate like the rest of us. But still, it may
be at least assumed that he can not be altogether lost sight
of, while bar-rooms remain and glasses retain their shape.
Punch has long been in the heads of people, and why not
Sherrie Kobler?&mdash;Let ambition take the hint. Why pile
a pyramid, or build the mighty city? Why undergo phlebotomy
in battles, or seek to be immortal in the evanescent
puffs of transitory newspapers? These are but the shadows
of a shade&mdash;the delusive phantasm of the moment; but
Sherrie Kobler&mdash;he is enshrined in men&mdash;not, observe ye,
in the deceitfulness of their hearts, or in the frigid reasoning
of their intellect&mdash;but deeper, surer, safer, in the cravings
of their stomach, there hoping to hold a state for ever&mdash;unless&mdash;at
which poor Sherrie Kobler shivers&mdash;unless the
second deluge of cold water which now surges round him,
hydropathically&mdash;this Sherrie Kobler can not swim&mdash;should
destroy him too, as it once destroyed a world.</p>

<p>But let us become acquainted with Sherrie Kobler himself,
having announced the peculiar fact by which the reality
of his existence has been carved upon the gate-posts of the
age&mdash;for Sherrie Kobler is not a man of single merit&mdash;not
a hero with "one virtue and a thousand crimes." Sherrie is

<!-- page 101 -->

jovial, jocose, and jolly, at all points, like a chestnut bur or
a porcupine&mdash;practically jocose and physically jolly; and it
is singular how he contrived to pass over the minor considerations
of annoyance to the rest of creation, in working out
of them all the materials for fun which they were capable of
producing. Indeed, the youthful Sherrie Kobler, who now
does "not misbeseem the promise of his spring," was a delightful
boy, to those who discern genius in its fainter struggling
and feebler developments. At that time of life, he
was not endowed with a superfluity of strength; yet the lack
of power was deliciously made up in adroitness; and he
could pull away the chair on which an elderly individual was
about to deposite himself, with a hand so neat and clever that
the tumble consequent thereon could not fail to elicit general
admiration. The crash was magnificent, though there
were occasions on which the performance was productive
somewhat of a suit of boxed ears, and various entertainments
of that vivacious description, which are, perhaps, more
practised than appreciated; and it was thus a source of frequent
complaint on the part of Sherrie and his admirers&mdash;especially
when stout ladies and maiden aunts were discomposed
after his peculiar fashion&mdash;that "some people never
know how to take a joke"&mdash;your joke probably not being
"taken" when an equivalent is returned in sundry manipulations
on the dexter and sinister aspects of your countenance.</p>

<p>The world is apt to treat us&mdash;Sherrie Kobler and all&mdash;as
Tony Lumpkin was treated at the Hardcastles'&mdash;"we
are always snubbed when we are in spirits."</p>

<p>So it was when Sherrie put brimstone on the stove or
powder in the scuttle&mdash;nay, the joke was rarely taken when
he had even encountered the trouble, on the coldest of nights,
to lodge extensive snowballs in the beds, or to pour water
into every boot. People have no perception of fun whatever;
and having undergone detriment by finding salt in
their coffee or fishes in their pockets&mdash;nay, after having

<!-- page 102 -->

been caused to tumble down stairs through the devices of ingenious
trickery, they rarely laughed, while Sherrie Kobler
was convulsed with merriment. Isn't it queer?</p>

<p>Not only so, but likewise when Sherrie endeavored to
develop the martial spirit of the neighbor children, by inducing
them to practise pugilism on each other, their mothers,
weakly repugnant to the visual and nasal traces of the
fray&mdash;variegations of black and crimson&mdash;were most vociferous
in complaint, as if there must not be attendant drawbacks
to the accomplishment of every good; and the case
was not much better when Sherrie undertook to match
Brown's dog against Smith's cat, down there in the cellar.
Besides, what harm is there in administering Cayenne pepper
to innocent urchins? Does it not make them friskier
than they ever were before, in the whole course of their
lives? And if there be such voracity in ducks, that they
will gobble up the stump of a lighted cigar, or try to chew
a burning coal, whose fault is it, we ask you, that ducks are
foolish? Sherrie could not help it, if he desired to elicit
fun, that his vicinity was always to be discovered by the
roarings, yelpings, squealings, and scoldings, that invariably
betokened his whereabouts; and if he put out his foot as
you passed&mdash;why didn't you take better care?&mdash;it was you
that fell down&mdash;not he.</p>

<p>Sherrie Kobler went at one time largely into the hoaxing
business, and would, in your name, sometime amuse himself
with advertising for cats or dogs in quantity, deliverable on
your premises. Unwished-for cabs would call to convey you
to most unwelcome places; and the undertaker would come
breathless with regret at your sudden demise, yet quite willing
to perform the job of this premature interment. Sherrie
was likewise curious in what we may call peptic combinations,
frequenting restaurants and oyster-cellars, to mix the
castors after receipts of his own, which queerly united those
various condiments that most people desire to commingle
for themselves. He could also&mdash;accomplished youth&mdash;sneeze

<!-- page 103 -->

so melodiously in church, as to provoke all the juveniles
to laughter; and at an opera, he yawned so loudly and
so judiciously at the most dulcet passages of the prima donna,
that while some chuckled, others again cried "turn him out."
It is he, likewise, that barks when the rest applaud.</p>

<p>It will be seen, then, that fun is the staple of Sherrie Kobler's
existence, and that fun he must have, at any cost and at
any hazard. Let the poet ask, if he will, "What is life with
out passion&mdash;sweet passion of love?" Sherrie Kobler is convinced
that life is not endurable or worthy of toleration without
a large modicum of that species of sport which, while it
is fun to him, is apt to be, comparatively, death to others.
"What fun can we have here?" is the first inquiry wherever
he goes; and if the circumstances be not productive of the
article, rely on it that Sherrie Kobler will surpass the leopard
and change his spot immediately. Fun, to be sure, is,
in his estimation, a very comprehensive phrase. If a horse
runs away, that of course is fun, for somebody is hurt. So,
too, with the upsetting of a vehicle. A riot, now, is fun alive,
especially if a lad or two be carried home from it dead.
There is a deal of fun, also, in a fire, should it be of the most
destructive sort; and a street-fight answers the purpose exceedingly
well, if nothing more exciting be at hand. Breaking
things is fun, moreover, if it so turn out that Sherrie is
not obliged to pay for them; and the fun is greatly enhanced,
if the sufferer has no redress and is quite unable to bear the
loss. Turbulence in steamboats, and tumult in railroad-cars&mdash;that's
tolerable fun, for want of better, if there are timid
women present to observe the manliness of the affair; and
all descriptions of roaring disturbances, every one of these
is fun, according to Sherrie Kobler and his followers, of
whom there are a good many "about in spots," at this present
writing.</p>

<p>And so, if suddenly metamorphosed into a dictionary, and
called upon authoritatively to give a precise definition of the
thing called fun, by the Sherrie Koblers and by "the boys"

<!-- page 104 -->

in general, it might be said, in sweeping terms, that fun is
nuisance, and that nuisance is fun. Fun, to be fun at all,
must annoy every one (excepting the funny ones themselves),
who chance to be within the sphere of its influence; and it
rises in the scale of funniment, just in proportion as it increases
in qualities of the disagreeable and painful sort.
Thus Sherrie Kobler, being a funny one, rejoices in all manner
of superfluous noises. He laughs with a reverberating
yell and an explosive violence that remind one of the storming
of Ciudad Roderigo, or the Battle of Prague&mdash;the louder
and the more appalling is his scream in proportion to the
insignificance of the cause of laughter, as if to make up in
din for a deficiency in sport. The slamming of doors "in
the dead waste and middle of the night," is another of Sherrie
Kobler's enjoyments, as he rattles up and down stairs,
like a drove of oxen or the battalion of flying artillery at
drill; and he practices upon trumpets, bugles, cornets, and
so forth, precisely as the "sma' hours" of the morning begin
to strike&mdash;enchanting Sherrie Kobler!</p>

<p>Sherrie has also a great fancy for the keeping of dogs&mdash;there's
such a deal of fun in dogs&mdash;in dogs that bark, for
example&mdash;sharp, excruciating, and excoriating terriers, down
below in the yard, which challenge every passing footstep or
recurring noise, with a piercing eloquence that causes each
nerve to tingle; or a forlorn pointer tied with a rope, that
howls at moonbeams and yelps at the intervening cloud.
There is a nocturnal pleasantry at Sherrie Kobler's, which
must be felt to be appreciated. The dog at distance leads
the choir, and never calls for aid in vain. The hint once
given, the full pack open at once, and a general cry prevails.
Who, then, so happy as Sherrie Kobler, as he hears the
sleepless neighborhood shout in vain from windows&mdash;"get
out!"&mdash;"lie down!"&mdash;"shut up!"&mdash;whistling, coaxing,
raging, for a little sleep, with dashings of water, and showerings
of bits of soap, of sticks, or brushes, or boots, just as
the chamber furnishes material for such projectile demonstrations?

<!-- page 105 -->

Ha! ha! fun alive for Sherrie Kobler. With
such a night, he is content to doze all day.</p>

<p>Sherrie, you see, is fond of pets, because, as you may observe,
when there are no other present means of eliciting
fun, through the instrumentality of pets a secondary degree
of fun may be extracted from the pet itself. A melancholy
life, in the vast majority of cases, is the life of a pet&mdash;as sad
almost as that of the retained jester of the olden time&mdash;and
hence your pet&mdash;canine, particularly&mdash;is almost always
cynical and misanthropic. Unhappy pet! it is for thee to
be washed, and combed, and adorned, and kept in chambers,
with ribands and with bells, while thy brothers and thy sisters
riot in dust and liberty! It is for thee, too, to be taught
tricks, all foreign to thy nature&mdash;to learn these sittings-up
and lyings-down, and giving me your paw, and jumpings-over
sticks! Harsh rebukes are for thee, with slaps and pinches&mdash;fondlings
now, and cuffings then, with all those bodily
disquiets which arise from uncongenial atmospheres and unwholesome
feedings. Pampered and puffy pet&mdash;no wonder
thou art cross, for thy whole existence is perchance a thwarting
and a crossing of nature's design for thee!&mdash;a splendid
misery is thine, poor pet, even when most caressed and
vaunted. No wonder pets will run away whenever doors
are open. There is no slavery like to theirs. Pray, pity
pets; and pity, beyond all others, the pets of Sherrie Kobler,
which are doomed, in one way or in another, to furnish fun,
and which can not even take the naps of weariness and exhaustion,
without a chance of Canton crackers to the nose or
distressing canisters to the tail. Thank your stars, my sighing
friend&mdash;that is, if you are ungrateful and repining&mdash;that
we are not compelled to "hold opinion with Pythagoras,"
or to have faith in the theory of transmigration; for
would it not be doleful to change hereafter into the pet of
funny men? Or what more fearful retribution could there
be, than for the funny man himself&mdash;in quadrupedal metamorphosis&mdash;to
be converted into the pet of men still funnier

<!-- page 106 -->

and more practical in joking than he has ever been? By
the way, tyrannic&mdash;sir, shall we say, or madam&mdash;did it
ever cross your mind, touching this realization of the "<i>Lex
Talionis</i>," which will return you like for like, and cause
you to feel remorsefully whatever pang you may have given
to others? You, that chide and rail, beware lest the servant's
post be yours&mdash;you, that spur the willing steed to
death, would such goadings thrill pleasantly through your
own person? And, Sherrie Koblers, what if you should
hold the place of pet to Sherrie Koblers yet unborn? Think
of it often&mdash;"what if my own measure be hereafter meted
out to me?"&mdash;and check the selfish impulse.</p>

<p>Sherrie Kobler's last arrangement of this sort, is in the
shape of a bull-terrier&mdash;an imported dog, direct from over
sea, and full, of course, of savagenesses and prejudices&mdash;a
carping, crusty dog, whose whole life is one of quarrel and
of fence&mdash;a dog that never frisks or smiles. No man e'er
saw a jocund wagging of the tail in him&mdash;no, nor a playful
bound&mdash;obviously, a dog disgusted with the world&mdash;devoid
of hope or love&mdash;of fear, favor, or affection.</p>

<p>"The funniest dog you ever saw," says Sherrie Kobler;
"bite anybody but me; and when he once takes hold, he
never lets go again. I never had so much fun with any dog
in my life. He has had a bite out of almost everybody I
know, and has swallowed samples of all my friends. He
shakes 'em beautiful! You should see him astonish the
match-boys and the apple-girls, when they come in at the
front-door; and every day, as I sit at the window, that dog,
who can do anything but talk, is sure to gather a crowd.
Sometimes he takes a horse by the nose, or another dog by
the throat, or some respectable old gentleman by the calf of
the leg; and then the fun of it is to see 'em try to make him
let go, with their cold water, big sticks, and all that. Yes,
that dog&mdash;Ole Bull&mdash;is worth his weight in gold&mdash;the funniest
dog anywhere's about."</p>

<p>When Sherrie Kobler feels dull or dejected&mdash;as the gayest

<!-- page 107 -->

sometimes will&mdash;for there is no sunshine without its
occasional cloud&mdash;he calls up Ole Bull to entertain him, and
laughs to see the illustrious Ole chase visiters down stairs.
You may see him now, disporting himself with the coat-tails
of one of Mr. Sherrie Kobler's chief creditors, preparatory
to munching up a portion of the individual.</p>

<p>"Wonderful dog, that Ole Bull!" cried Sherrie Kobler:
"he can tell a man with a bill in his pocket, just like a book&mdash;he
can't bear anything bilious. Deal of fun in that
dog."</p>

<p>But the chief creditor aforesaid had not a perceptive faculty
in reference to the humorous, especially when the joke
was at his own expense. He intimated indeed&mdash;the unreasonable
creature&mdash;that it was a little too bad to be bitten so
deeply, first by Ole Bull's master, and then by Ole Bull himself&mdash;the
practice was too sharp altogether; and so he took
measures to curtail Sherrie Kobler's enjoyment of life, and
contributed to bring that amiable personage's public career
as "a man about town" to a melancholy close and a disastrous
twilight. Fun, we find, is not commercially productive,
and is not yet regarded in the light of a legal tender for the
payment of debts. Neither do bull-terriers pass current for
bullion or relief-notes. Sherrie Kobler, therefore, could not
pay, and consequently was allowed to joke no more at large;
but as he left his lodgings, in charge of an officer, he took
occasion to vent his exasperated feelings in a manner congenial
to the circumstances, by dealing out a potent kick to
his deposed favorite, Ole Bull; and Ole Bull&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Ingratitude more strong than traitors' arms"&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>did not hesitate to follow the lead thus given, according to
the capabilities and resources with which he is gifted. Ole
Bull borrowed a bit from his master.</p>

<p>The officer laughed&mdash;swore it was comical&mdash;roared over
it as a good joke&mdash;thought Ole Bull the funniest dog <i>he</i> ever

<!-- page 108 -->

saw in his life. But as for Sherrie Kobler&mdash;hold!&mdash;let a
veil be drawn over the griefs we can not hope to depict.</p>

<p>The result proved that fun is fun, relatively&mdash;according
to the position we occupy in regard to the act of fun. When
Sherrie Kobler laughed and roared, it is sure that some one
else was weeping; and perhaps it would not be amiss for all,
as they pass through life, to endeavor to view both sides of
every question, that our enjoyment may not be neutralized
in the broad account by the suffering of others&mdash;a wisdom
to which, it may be, that Sherrie Koblers rarely help us.</p>

<p>SINGLETON SNIPPE:</p>

<p class="small">WHO MARRIED FOR A LIVING.</p>

</div>

<p>"USED to be&mdash;"</p>

<p>We have, as a general rule, an aversion to this species
of qualifying phraseology, in which so many are prone to
indulge. It seems to argue a disposition like to that of Iago,
who "was nothing, if not critical;" and it indicates a tendency
to spy out flaws and to look after defect&mdash;a disposition
and a tendency at war, we think, with that rational
scheme of happiness which derives its comfort from the reflection
of the sunny side of things. "It was"&mdash;"she has
been"&mdash;"he used to be"&mdash;and so forth, as if all merit were
a reminiscence&mdash;if not past, at least passing away. Is that
a pleasure? Would it not be quite as well to applaud the
present aspect, and to be satisfied with the existing circumstances,
instead of murmuring over the fact that once it was
brighter?</p>

<p>But yet there is a difference&mdash;</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;decidedly&mdash;the matter here is beyond the possibility
of a dispute.</p>

<p>There is a difference&mdash;lamentable enough, you may term
it&mdash;between the Singleton Snippe that was, and the Singleton
Snippe that is.</p>

<p>The Singleton Snippe that was, is not now an existence;
and the probabilities are that he never will be again. Nothing
is stable in this world but instability; and the livery-stable
of to-day is converted into something else on the morrow,
never more to be a stable, unstable stable. And so with
men as well as with horses&mdash;for this perpetual revolution

<!-- page 110 -->

of human affairs goeth not backward, except when the rope
breaks on an inclined plane, making it a down-hill sort of a
business. Snippe is on the down-hill&mdash;rather.</p>

<p>The Singleton Snippe that is, stands picturesquely and
pictorially before you&mdash;patiently, as it were, and on a monument.</p>

<p>And now, was there ever&mdash;we ask the question of those
who remember Snippe in his primitive and natural state&mdash;was
there ever a merrier fellow than the said Singleton
Snippe, in the original, if we may term it so&mdash;before the said
Singleton was translated into his present condition, and became
tamed down from his erratic, independent eccentricities
to the patient tolerance of the band-box and the bundle?
Who, thus remembering and thus contrasting Singleton
Snippe as he was, with the Singleton Snippe as he is now
portrayed, could possibly believe that there are processes in
life&mdash;chymistries and alchymies&mdash;which could bring the
man of to-day so diametrically opposite to the same man of
yesterday; and cause the Singleton Snippe of the past to
differ with such strangeness from the Singleton Snippe of the
current era? Two Snippes, as plain as may be; but legally
and responsibly the same Snippe. There was Snippe the
bold&mdash;Snippe the reckless&mdash;Snippe the gay and hilarious&mdash;scoffing,
joking, jeering Snippe&mdash;Snippe that was always
on hand for mischief or for fun&mdash;Snippe, with the cigar in
his mouth, or the champagne-glass in his grasp&mdash;yes, the
very Snippe whom you have so often heard in the street,
disturbing slumber by the loud and musical avowal of his
deliberate determination not to "go home till morning," as
if it would, barring the advantage of the daylight, be any
easier to him then, and whose existence was ever a scene of
uproar and jollity, except in the repentant intervals of headache
and exhaustion. And then, besides his ornamental
purposes, he was such a useful member of society, this Singleton
Snippe, in the consumption of the good things of this
life at the restaurants and in the oyster saloon.</p>

<!-- page 111 -->

<p>Was not that a Snippe&mdash;something like a Snippe?</p>

<p>But, alas for Snippe, the last representative of the illustrious
firm of "Tom &amp; Jerry." Who is there now&mdash;now
that Snippe is withdrawn as a partner from the establishment&mdash;to
maintain the credit of the house? Snippe is
snubbed&mdash;snubbed is Snippe. Well, well, well&mdash;let the
watchmen&mdash;sweet voices of the night&mdash;rejoice in their
boxes, if they will, over their pine-kindlings, and their hot
sheet-iron stoves&mdash;rejoice in their cosy slumbers, that the
original Snippe no longer molests their ancient, solitary
reign, by uncouth noises, preliminary, symphonious, and
symptomatic to a row. And let the cabmen&mdash;want a cab,
sir?&mdash;be merry, too, with rein in hand, or reclining against
the friendly wall, that they are no more to be victimized by
the practical jocularities of the school of Singleton Snippe.
What relish have they for the gracefulness of existence&mdash;its
little playful embellishments that bead and dimple the
dull surface of the pond into the varieties of playful fantasy.</p>

<p>Such as these would describe a boy of the superlative
order of merit, as "one that goes straight home and never
stops to play on the road;" and we all know that Singleton
Snippe never went straight home in the whole course of his
experience.</p>

<p>Home!</p>

<p>Home, it should be understood, so much vaunted by the
poets, and so greatly delighted in by the antipodes to Snippe,
is regarded in quite a different light&mdash;humdrumish&mdash;by the
disciples of Snippeism. Home, according to them, is not
so much a spot to retire to, as a place to escape from&mdash;a
centre of rendezvous, no doubt, with the washerwoman, the
bootblack, and other indispensable people of that sort.
Snippe's new clothes were always sent home: and long
bills, provocative of long faces, were apt to follow them with
the certainty of cause and effect.&mdash;But to stay at home himself&mdash;what&mdash;Snippe?&mdash;He
stay at home? He was called
for occasionally at that point&mdash;his breakfast was taken there,

<!-- page 112 -->

when any degree of appetite remained from the preceding
night; and a note would eventually reach its destination if
left for him there. But it required a very unusual conjunction
of circumstances to find Singleton Snippe at home more
frequently than could be helped. Home, in Snippe's estimation,
was the embodiment of a yarn&mdash;he never heard of it
without the most extended of gapes. He could not speak
of it without opening his mouth to the extent of its volume;
and Snippe's mouth is not a diamond edition, but rather an
octavo, if not rising to the dignity of a quarto, at least when
he is drinking. "Home!" said he; "home's a bore. What
fun is there at home, except dozing over the fire, or snoring
on a sofa?"</p>

<p>Home, indeed!&mdash;Talk to Snippe about staying at home,
if you would risk a home-icide. To be sure, when too ill
to run about, Singleton Snippe remained unwillingly at
home, as if it were an hospital; and he stayed at home once
for the space of an evening, merely to try the experiment,
when he was in health; but before he went to bed, Snippe
had thoughts of sending for the coroner, to sit upon his body,
but changed his mind and brewed a jorum of punch, which,
after he had shod the cat with walnut shells, somewhat reconciled
him to the monotony of domestic enjoyment. But
Snippe never stayed at home again, not he. Home is where
the heart is; and Snippe's heart was a traveller&mdash;a locomotive
heart, preambulating; and it had no tendencies toward
circumscription and confine. That put him out of heart altogether.</p>

<p>Wherever anything was going on&mdash;"a fight or a foot-race,"
according to popular phraseology, which thus distinguishes
the desirable in the shape of spectacular entertainment&mdash;there
was Snippe, with his hat set knowingly on
one side, to indicate that if others felt out of their element
on the occasion, he, Snippe, was perfectly at home, under all
circumstances&mdash;the more at home, the more singular the
occasion, and the more strange the circumstance; and his

<!-- page 113 -->

hat was the more knowingly set on to indicate the extent of
his superiority to vulgar prejudices. It was the hat of a
practical philosopher&mdash;a thorough-bred man of the world,
who could extract sport from anything, and who did not care,
so that the occurrence afforded excitement, whether other
people thought it reprehensible or not.&mdash;Yes, yes&mdash;there
is much in a hat&mdash;talk of your physiognomy and your
phrenology&mdash;what are they as indications of character, feeling,
and disposition, compared to the "set" of one's beaver?
Look at courage, will you, with his hat drawn resolutely
down upon its determined brow. Dare you dispute the way
with such a hat as that? The meek one and the lowly,
with his hat placed timidly on the back of his head&mdash;does
not every bully practice imposition there? Hats turned up
behind, indicate a scornful indifference to public opinion in
all its phases&mdash;say what you will, who cares? While the
hat turned up before, has in it a generous confidence, free
from suspicion of contempt. Nay, more&mdash;when science
has made a further progress, why should not the expression
of the hat afford knowledge of the passing mood of mind in
its wearer, the hat shifting and changing in position as the brain
beneath forms new combinations of thought? Let the shop-boy
answer; does he not discover at a glance, from the style
in which his master wears his hat at the moment, whether he,
the subordinate, is to be greeted with scoldings and reproaches,
or with commendations and applause? Does not
the hat paternal forbode the sunshine or the storm; and as
the pedagogue approaches school, where is the trembling
truant who does not discern "the morn's disaster" from the
cocking of that awful hat? There can not be a doubt of it.
The science of the hat yet remains to be developed; and
deep down in the realms of ignorance are they who have
not reflected yet upon the clue afforded by the hat to what is
passing in the soul of him who wears it.</p>

<p>Thus, you could distinguish Singleton Snippe's hat at a
horse-race, at a riot, or at a fire&mdash;equally delighted was that

<!-- page 114 -->

hat at every species of uproar&mdash;in the street&mdash;the lobby&mdash;the
bar-room, or wherever else that hat could spy out "fun,"
the great staple of its existence, with this advantage, that it
had an instinct of peril, and could extricate itself from danger
without the slightest ruffling of its fur. Snippe was
wise&mdash;Snippe preferred that all detriments should fall to
the share of others, while the joke remained with him.</p>

<p>But at last a change reached even unto the hat of Snippe&mdash;change
comes to all; a change, singularly enough, that
took all other change from the pockets of Snippe. He was
obliged to discover that the mere entertainments of life are
not a commodity to live upon, and that however pleasant it
may be to amuse one's self, the profits thereon accruing do
not furnish continued means of delectation and delight.
Snippe neglected his business, and consequently, his business,
with a perversity peculiar to business, neglected
Snippe&mdash;so that Snippe and Snippe's business had a falling
out.</p>

<p>"This will never do," declared Snippe, after deep reflection
on the subject of ways and means&mdash;"never do in the
world."</p>

<p>But yet it did do&mdash;did do for Singleton Snippe, and effectually
broke him up in the mercantile way, which involved
all other ways; and so Mr. Snippe resolved to make the
most available market that presented itself for the retrieval
of past error. Snippe resolved to marry&mdash;advantageously,
of course. Snippe was not poetical&mdash;he had no vein of
romance in his constitution; he could live very well by himself,
if he only had the means for that purpose; but not having
the means, unfortunate Snippe, he determined to live by
somebody else, living of some sort being a matter of necessity
in Snippe's estimation, though no other person could
discover what necessity there was for the living of Snippe.
The world might revolve without a Snippe; and affairs generally
would work smoothly enough, even if he were not
present. Snippe labored under a delusion.

<!-- page 115 -->

<p>But Still&mdash;not having much of philosophy in his composition
to enable him to discover that, so far as the general
economy of the universe is concerned, it was no matter
whether Singleton Snippe obtained a living or not; and lacking
the desire, if not also the ability, to work out that living
by his own energies of head and hands, Snippe, according
to his own theory, having too much of proper pride and of
commendable self-respect to engage in toil, though some of
the unenlightened gave it the less respectful designation of
laziness, which, perhaps, is a nearer relative to the pride of the
Snippes than is generally supposed&mdash;Snippe, as already intimated,
made up his mind to marry aforesaid&mdash;upon the
mercantile principle&mdash;bartering Snippe as a valuable commodity
(without regard to the penal enactments against obtaining
goods on false pretences), for a certain share of
boarding and lodging, and of the other appliances required
for the outfit and the sustenance of a gentleman of wit
and leisure about town&mdash;Snippe offered to the highest bidder&mdash;Snippe
put up, and Snippe knocked down&mdash;going&mdash;gone!</p>

<p>Now, although there are many who would not have had
Singleton Snippe about the premises, even as a gift, and
would have rejected him had he been offered as a Christmas-box,
yet there was a rich widow, having the experience
of three or four husbands, who did not hesitate on the experiment
of endeavoring to fashion our Snippe into the
shape and form of a good and an available husband. Mrs.
Dawkins was fully aware of the nature of his past life, and
of the peculiarities of his present position. She likewise
formed a shrewd guess as to the reasons which impelled
him to seek her well-filled hand, and to sigh after her plethoric
purse&mdash;Snippe in search of a living; but confident in
her own skill&mdash;justly confident, as was proved by the result&mdash;to
reduce the most rebellious into a proper state of submissiveness
and docility, she yielded her blushing assent to
become the blooming bride of Singleton Snippe, and to undertake

<!-- page 116 -->

the government of that insubordinate province, the
state of man.</p>

<p>"I shall marry Mrs. Dawkins," thought Snippe; but,
alas! how mistakenly; "I shall marry her," repeated he,
"and, for a week or two, I'll be as quiet as a lamb, sitting
there by the fire a twiddling of my thumbs, and saying all
sorts of sweet things about 'lovey,' and 'ducky,' and so
forth. But as soon after that as possible, when I've found
out how to get at the cash, then Mrs. Dawkins may make
up her mind to be astonished a little. That dining-room of
hers will do nice for suppers and card-parties, and punch
and cigars&mdash;we'll have roaring times in that room, mind I
tell you we will. I'll have four dogs in the yard&mdash;two
pinters, a poodle, and a setter; and they shall come into the
parlor to sleep on the rug, and to hunt the cat whenever
they want to. A couple of horses besides&mdash;I can't do
without horses&mdash;a fast trotter, for fun, and a pacer for exercise;
and a great many more things, which I can't remember
now. But Mrs. Dawkins has a deal to learn, I can tell
her. There's nothing humdrum about Singleton Snippe;
and if she did henpeck my illustrious predecessors, she has
got to find the difference in my case."</p>

<p>So Snippe emphasized his hat plump upon his brow, and
looked like the individual, not Franklin, that defied the
lightning.</p>

<p>"And I shall marry Singleton Snippe," also soliloquized
Mrs. Dawkins, "who is described to me as one of the wildest
of colts, and as being only in pursuit of my money.
Well, I'm not afraid. A husband is a very convenient article
to have about the house&mdash;to run errands, to call the
coach, to quarrel with work-people, and to accompany me
on my visits. Everybody ought to have a husband to complete
the furniture; and as for his being a wild colt, as Mrs.
Brummagen says, I should like to see the husband of mine
who will venture to be disobedient to my will when he has
to come to me for everything he wants. I'll teach Mr. Singleton

<!-- page 117 -->

Snippe to know his place in less than a week, or else
Mr. Singleton Snippe is a very different person from the
generality of men.</p>

<p>Thus Singleton Snippe and Mrs. Dorothea Dawkins became
one, on the programme above specified; and thus
Mr. Singleton Snippe, whose last dollar was exhausted in
the marriage-fee, was enabled to obtain a living. Poor
Snippe!</p>

<p>Glance, with tear in eye, if tears you have, at the portrait
of the parties, now first laid before the public&mdash;note it
in your books, how sadly Singleton Snippe is metamorphosed
from the untamed aspect that formerly distinguished him in
the walks of men, and tell us whether Driesbach, Van Amburgh,
or Carter, ever effected a revolution so great as we
find here presented. Observe the bandbox, and regard the
umbrell'&mdash;see&mdash;above all&mdash;see how curiously and how
securely Singleton Snippe's hand is enfolded in that of Mrs.
Singleton Snippe, that she may be sure of him, and that he
may not slip from her side, and relapse into former habits&mdash;"safe
bind, safe find," is the matrimonial motto of Mrs. Singleton
Snippe. Moreover, in vindication of our favorite
theory of the expression of the beaver, mark ye the drooping
aspect of Snippe's chapeau, as if it had been placed
there by Mrs. Snippe herself, to suit her own fancy, and to
avoid the daring look of bachelor, which is her especial
detestation.</p>

<p>Snippe is subdued&mdash;a child might safely play with him.</p>

<p>And now, curious psychologist and careful commentator
on the world, would you learn how results, apparently so
miraculous, were effected and brought about? Read, then,
and be wiser.</p>

<p>Snippe has his living, for he is living yet, though he
scarcely calls it living&mdash;but Mrs. Snippe firmly holds the
key of the strong-box, and thus grasps the reins of authority.
The Snippes are tamed as lions are&mdash;by the mollifying
and reducing result of the system of short allowances.

<!-- page 118 -->

Wonderful are the effects thereof, triumphant over
Snippes&mdash;no suppers, no cards, no punches, and no cigars.
The dogs retreated before judicious applications of the
broom-handle; and it was found a matter of impossibility to
trot those horses up&mdash;the arm of cavalry formed no branch
in the services of Singleton Snippe.</p>

<p>Foiled at other points, Mr. Snippe thought that he might
at least be able to disport himself in the old routine, and to
roam abroad with full pockets in the vivacious field of former
exploit; and he endeavored one evening silently to
reach his hat and coat, and to glide away.</p>

<p>"Hey, hey!&mdash;what's that?&mdash;where, allow me to ask, are
you going at this time of night, Mr. Snippe?" cried the lady,
in notes of ominous sharpness.</p>

<p>"Out," responded Snippe, with a heart-broken expression,
like an afflicted mouse.</p>

<p>"Out, indeed!&mdash;where's out, I'd like to know?&mdash;where's
out, that you prefer it to the comfortable pleasures of your
own fireside?"</p>

<p>"Out is nowhere in particular, but everywhere in general,
to see what's going on. Everybody goes out, Mrs. Snippe,
after tea, they do."</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Snippe, everybody don't&mdash;do I go out, Mr.
Snippe, without being able to say where I am going to?
No, Mr. Snippe, you are not going out to frolic, and smoke,
and drink, and riot round, upon my money. If you go out,
I'll go out too. But you're not going out. Give me that hat,
Mr. Snippe, and do you sit down there, quietly, like a sober,
respectable man."</p>

<p>And so, Mr. Snippers hat&mdash;wonder not at its dejection&mdash;was
securely placed every evening under Mrs. Snippe's
most watchful eye; and Mr. Snippe, after a few unavailing
efforts to the contrary, was compelled to yield the point, to
stay quietly at home, his peculiar destination, and to nurse
the lap-dog, and to cherish the cat, instead of bringing poodle

<!-- page 119 -->

and setter into the drawing-room to discontent the feline
favorite.</p>

<p>"I want a little money, Mrs. Snippe, if you please&mdash;some
change."</p>

<p>"And pray, allow me to ask what you want it for, Mr,
Snippe?"</p>

<p>"To pay for things, my dear."</p>

<p>"Mr. Snippe, I tell you once for all, I'm not going to
nurture you in your extravagance, I'm not. Money, indeed!&mdash;don't
I give you all you wish to eat, and all you want to
wear? Let your bills be sent to me, Mr. Snippe, and I'll
save you all trouble on that score. What use have you for
money? No, no&mdash;husbands are always extravagant, and
should never be trusted with money. My money, Mr.
Snippe&mdash;mine&mdash;jingling in your pockets, would only
tempt you to your old follies, and lead you again to your
worthless companions. I know well that husbands with
money are never to be trusted out of one's sight&mdash;never.
I'll take better care of you than that, Mr. Snippe, I will."</p>

<p>If Singleton Snippe ever did escape, he was forthwith
brought to the confessional, to give a full and faithful
account of all that had occurred during his absence&mdash;where
he had been&mdash;whom he had seen&mdash;what he had done, and
everything that had been said, eliciting remarks thereon,
critical and hypercritical, from his careful guardian; and
so also, when a little cash did come into his possession, he
was compelled to produce it, and to account for every deficient
cent.</p>

<p>No wonder, then, that Singleton Snippe underwent</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"A sea change,<br/>

Into something quaint and strange."</p>

</div>

<p>He married for a living, but while he lives, he is never
sure whether it is himself or not, so different is the Singleton
Snippe that is, from the Singleton Snippe that
was.</p>

<!-- page 120 -->

<p>If you would see and appreciate differences in this respect,
it would not be amiss to call upon the Snippes, and observe
with what a subdued, tranquillized expression, the once
dashing, daring Snippe now sits with his feet tucked under
his chair, to occupy as little room as possible, speaking only
when he is spoken to, and confining his remarks to "Yes,
ma'm," and "No, ma'm." Mrs. Snippe has "conquered a
peace."</p>

<p>QUINTUS QUOZZLE'S CATASTROPHE.</p>

<p class="small">A PHRENOLOGICAL ILLUSTRATION.</p>

</div>

<p>WHETHER phrenology, in its details&mdash;geographical phrenology,
if we may call it so&mdash;which plots out the cranium,
like a topographical engineer, giving a local habitation and
a name to each distinct faculty of the mind&mdash;whether this
hypothesis should be received as true or not, is a question
about which, as the work of proselytism&mdash;either way&mdash;happens
to be none of our business, it is not the purpose to argue
at this present writing. It may be, or it may not be&mdash;let
learned doctors decide; taking care, however, that judgment
is neither warped nor biased by personal interest in the
matter. One is so apt to incline to that which flatters his
own "developments," and to frown adversely upon a system
which would register his intellectual gifts as rising only from
"pretty fair to middling." It is an impulse of our nature to
love that which deals kindly with us; and it will often be
found that the <i>pro</i> and the <i>con</i> in the argument now alluded
to, is more or less influenced by such considerations. With
a cerebral expansion as rotund and majestic as a pumpkin,
who can array himself in hostility to Gall and Spurzheim?
Greatness may not, perhaps, have as yet made itself apparent;
but it is pleasant to think that it will at last come forth,
and to rest in the faith that the day of our supremacy is
about to dawn. But, on the contrary, if our upper story be
set down as nothing remarkable, why should we subscribe to
Combe, or believe that there is aught in measurement? The
great and governing principle of the <i>quid pro quo</i> demands

<!-- page 122 -->

our gratitude in the one instance; but, in the other, it is evident
that no return is to be expected at our hands.</p>

<p>Thus, it will be noted, for the most part, that the individual
who requires a hat of the extra size, habitually hiding
his light under a bushel, and who, therefore, is unable to improve
his craniological embellishment, even at the most
crowded of tea-parties, by the appropriation of a newer and
better beaver than his own&mdash;the fitness of things forbidding
the exercise of such choice and discrimination, so far as he is
concerned&mdash;is apt to look with a complacent eye upon the
science to which we refer; while the person whose physical
man is crowned with a pippin, and to whom a thimble would
serve as a helmet, is at once of opinion that the whole of
these assumptions are ridiculous, and that, perhaps, the truth
will eventually be proved to lie in a contrary direction. If
it be said that we either are, or ought to be, a wit or a warrior,
a statesman or a philosopher, the intelligence falls
agreeably upon the ear, and the inference is unavoidable,
that there must be profundity in him who has been able to
discover the latent fact, when not a sign of it is apparent to
the general view, and when it is the first time that we have
fallen even under a suspicion of being wiser than our neighbors.
But should it be announced to us, that we have no
business with ambition, and that our hope is a deceiver&mdash;that
distinction is unattainable, and that the nursery predictions
of our future glory were but the idle dream in which
fond parents are apt to indulge&mdash;it is merely a defensive
means and a retributive return, to set him down a simpleton
who has the hardihood to tell us so. Let those, then, who
would arrive at a candid conclusion, beware at once of
Scylla and Charybdis, lest their heads come in contact with
a post.</p>

<p>Being, as it were, non-committal upon this point, it is
enough just now to declare a decided belief&mdash;founded upon
great research and careful investigation&mdash;that instances do
occur when there is much in a head, and that there are cases

<!-- page 123 -->

to the contrary&mdash;full cases and empty cases, but still cases
in point; establishing the fact, which is something for philosophy
to go upon, that there are two varieties of the article in
market. Many a man, deceived by the semblance which
rests with the vacuity of a balloon upon his deluded shoulders,
flatters himself with an idea that it is positively a head&mdash;available
and efficient&mdash;and does not hesitate to make
purchases for its adornment: he pets it up, and he brushes
it down&mdash;has it trimmed, curled, and perfumed&mdash;admires
it in the glass, and "goes ahead" with complacency&mdash;yet
his friends and neighbors, in consultation, will shake their
own heads, as they declare that he has no head at all, showing
the strange diversities of opinion that exist in some heads
on other heads. Nay, he will actually imagine, upon occasion,
that his head aches&mdash;there are numbers, indeed, to
whom the head is only a thing to ache with&mdash;and he ties it
up in a napkin, to be deplored over and to be sympathized
upon, at the very moment probably when society announces
its conviction that&mdash;poor fellow&mdash;if he only had a head,
what a good thing it would be. It is a delusion under which
the community labors, that each member claims a head to
himself, while the rest of the people are clear in regard to
it, that he has none&mdash;only a symbol and an effigy of that
useful appendage.</p>

<p>Thus far, then, public opinion and phrenology have advanced
together. It is settled that there is a difference in
heads&mdash;heads of reality and heads of appearance&mdash;heads
by courtesy, and not of right. But whether the brain be a
general power, ready to rush with all its force and with equal
energy in any designated direction, or whether it be a congeries
of organs, distinct in function, but living together, so
to speak, in a boarding-house, sometimes in harmony, but
anon in antagonism, as often happens with inmates of various
minds, tempers, fancies, and inclinations, is a matter that remains
open for debate.</p>

<p>In the case of Quozzle, now&mdash;Quintus Quozzle, who is

<!-- page 124 -->

troubled with "self-esteem"&mdash;what is to be said? It is his
peculiarity to "know better" than anybody else; and how
can he help it, that he is so much wiser than every other
person with whom it is his fortune to meet? He could not,
if he would, prevent himself from knowing better than they,
even if it were desirable that there should be no display of
superior intelligence. It is the instinct of Quintus Quozzle
which operates on such occasions, and instincts are not easily
to be repressed. Quozzle is not accountable, were it to be
attributed to him as a fault, for his intellectual superiority to
the rest of the world. His nicety of mental constitution was
not a matter of his own choice.</p>

<p>"I would be a great deal happier, I know I should," said
Quozzle, when he felt that he was not properly appreciated,
and had reason to complain of the world's ingratitude, "if I
was not more than half as 'cute&mdash;to be extra 'cute is more
of a misfortune than an advantage; and if I was just like
other people, then I could be as foolish as other people, and
as happy as other people, because I wouldn't know what a
fool I was. There must have been some mistake about it:
I was born at least a hundred years too soon, and came into
the world before it was ready for me. No one yet comprehends
Quozzle&mdash;no one can&mdash;it takes Quozzle himself to
be up to Quozzle, and to appreciate his qualities; and if it
wasn't for that&mdash;if I didn't know what a first-rate fellow I
am, which is a great comfort, when other folks haven't brains
enough to find it out&mdash;I would be wasted completely. It is
the only pleasure the Quozzles have, to think how very green
everybody else is. It makes 'em mad to say so, to be sure;
and they take revenge by hinting that I'm crazy; but it's a
sort of a tax and a tariff upon first-rate people to be called
cracked&mdash;I don't mind being called cracked&mdash;the greatest
people are always called the crack'dest people, out of
spite."</p>

<p>It is even so, Quintus Quozzle. The pioneer has an unpleasant
time of it. "He who surpasses or subdues mankind,"

<!-- page 125 -->

must expect scratches in the bramble-bush; and the
men of superior views&mdash;especially the Quozzles&mdash;are
generally in danger of being set down as a little "cracked."
It is the short-hand method of disposing of them.</p>

<p>"When they have nothing else to say&mdash;when they can't
answer, and when they don't understand, they always try to
get off by telling me I'm cracked; and then I tell them that
they are in no danger of such an accident&mdash;their heads won't
crack by hard thinking&mdash;empty things and soft things never
crack," added Quozzle.</p>

<p>It, however, was not voluntary on Quozzle's part, that he
is thus subjected to detraction. So far as his volition had a
share in it, he might just as well have been somebody else.
But since he is Quozzle, it is unavoidable to fulfil his vocation,
and at least to endeavor to set other people right.
True, they may say that Quozzle is a goose&mdash;which, when
said of any one is apt to be unpleasant, if he happens to
hear of it. Still, however, there is a balm for all such hurts
to Quozzle's self esteem, in the reflection that what human
nature thinks of him, is only an ignorant opinion; while
what he thinks of human nature, is an incontrovertible fact&mdash;a
fixed fact.&mdash;"What do they know about it, the benighted
individuals?" says Quozzle.</p>

<p>He feels that his perceptions are of a higher power than
those which appertain to mankind in general; and with a
spontaneous waking "clairvoyance," he sees direct through
the opacity of millstones. Quozzle, therefore, is never
puzzled and rarely perplexed, especially in regard to the
course of action which others should pursue. If they would
only consult him, no difficulty, impediment, or embarrassment,
could possibly arise&mdash;there would be no such word
as fail&mdash;the mischances which so often occur, spring altogether
from a neglect to take counsel with Quozzle.</p>

<p>"If people would only take my advice," says Quozzle,
"they would save themselves from a deal of trouble; but
people are so obstinate in their opinions&mdash;they insist upon

<!-- page 126 -->

it that they know best, when I tell them over and over again
that they don't. They sometimes come to ask me about it,
to be sure; and if I think as they do, then they follow my
advice; but if I don't think as they do&mdash;and I don't often&mdash;then
they don't follow my advice. They ought to be a
law passed to make 'em do as I tell 'em.&mdash;There's Stibbins,
now, with a dozen children&mdash;limbs, every one of them.&mdash;'Stibbins,'
says I, 'them children of yourn, are decidedly the
worst children I ever did see; and it's a fact; and Stibbins,
you don't know how they ought to be fetched up, the barbarous
young aborigines&mdash;whale 'em, Stibbins, night and
morning; and I don't care if I bear a hand myself&mdash;And
what do you think Stibbins said?&mdash;why, Stibbins, says he,
'There's the door, Mr. Quozzle,' says he&mdash;'walk Spanish,'
says Stibbins, says he, 'or I'll be after whaling you, your
own self;' and he swore his boys were the best boys about."</p>

<p>In truth, Quozzle has a plan for every case&mdash;an alternative
for every emergency&mdash;he explains the principle of
the locomotive to an engineer, and endeavors to make the
captain comprehend the true management of a steamboat&mdash;when
he reads a newspaper, he sees at once that no one understand
editorship but himself, and when he returns from
church, he is quite melancholy at the loss society suffers,
because he had not been brought up to the ministry. "If
they would only let me teach them how to write sermons,"
says Quozzle, "good would come of it&mdash;I've got the right
idea&mdash;call that preaching, indeed!&mdash;but no one knows but
me&mdash;I'd make 'em understand the error of their ways&mdash;I'd&mdash;but
what's the use of talking?&mdash;We must put up with it,
I suppose; and it's not my fault there is so much wickedness
about; for when I call upon those whose business it is
to see after it, and furnish them with hints, they say, 'Good
morning Mr. Quozzle&mdash;I'm obliged to you, Mr, Quozzle;
I'm busy just now, Mr. Quozzle; but I'll think of what you
suggest, Mr. Quozzle,' and that's the end of it.</p>

<p>"Why, when I called upon the sheriff and the mayor to

<!-- page 127 -->

explain to 'em how to put down riots by using the engines
and squirting riot out, on the teetotal principle, squenching
them at once, the people said I was a stupid pump; and the
constable opened the door and told me to navigate like a
duck. But cold water is the doctrine, and they'll all have
to come to it at last. Who would stand still to be played
upon?"</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Fubbs did not agree very well&mdash;there were
rumors of fierce discussions over the breakfast-table; and it
was said that "twist-loaves" passed to and fro sometimes in
the way of a missile; but when Quozzle went to see them
on an errand of peace, the result came near being disastrous.
By way of preliminary, he had merely hinted to Mr. Fubbs
that he was inclined to be a bear, and had also informed
Mrs. Fubbs that she was by no means so wise a person as
she might be, rendering it impossible for them to live comfortably
together without his advice&mdash;he knew how to govern
wives and to regulate husbands&mdash;when the contending
forces united against the pacificator, and fairly turned him
out of doors.</p>

<p>"You, Quozzle," screamed Mrs. Fubbs, "never let me
see your ugly face here again the longest day you have to
live!&mdash;my Fubbs a bear, indeed! If he did throw a 'twist'
at me, didn't I dodge?"</p>

<p>"Put out, Quozzle&mdash;I'm getting dangerous&mdash;my wife a
fool, only because she never knows when to hold her tongue,
or to quit aggrawatin'! Just say that twice more, and clear
me of the law!" added Fubbs, assuming a pugilistic attitude,
as Quozzle disappeared round the corner.</p>

<p>Quozzle has the genius for criticism in every department&mdash;there
is nothing within the range of human effort, which
might not be better done, if he were permitted to advise, or
if he were allowed to undertake the execution thereof.
When Macready personated Hamlet, Quozzle smiled rather
derisively in the midst of the applause; and when Forrest
as Spartacus brought down thunders of approbation, Quozzle

<!-- page 128 -->

was sure that he could have made the character more effective.
Indeed, in both cases, he satisfied himself of the correctness
of his impression, by corking his eyebrows and going
into a tragic phrensy before the glass. No one could
have been more alarmed than Mrs. Sampler, the landlady,
when Quozzle told her to "go to a nunnery, go!" and poor
Boots has not completely recovered to this day from the terror
of it, when, in answer to his humble tap at the door, Mr.
Quozzle caught up the poker and cried out "Let 'em come
in&mdash;we're armed!"&mdash;Boots rolled headlong down the stairs;
nor did the added cry of "freedom to gladiators and to slaves,"
serve at all to tranquillize his nerves. He is clearly of opinion
that Mr. Quozzle is affected with the hydrofogy; while
Quozzle thinks that but for the accident of position, the
stage would now be graced with the presence of another
Garrick.</p>

<p>Ole Bull is clever enough in his peculiar department; but
yet if Quozzle only had time to attend a little to the violin,
the public, perhaps, would have the chance to hear a better
tone and a more touching expression. Quozzle has a theory
of his own in regard to fiddles. The capabilities of that instrument
are not yet fully developed; and in the other divisions
of musical endeavor, if Quozzle were only a woman,
Norma would at last have justice done to her. The whole
neighborhood must be aware of the fact&mdash;do they not hear
Quozzle sing? And as for dancing&mdash;what nonsense to
talk about Elssler. Look at Quozzle when he kicks.</p>

<p>Quozzle, however, is not quite forlorn upon his Alpine
height of intellectual eminence. There is one person, at
least, to treat him with respect and deference&mdash;Bob Spanker&mdash;and
Bob never thought that Quozzle had the misfortune
to be cracked&mdash;Spanker never thinks at all&mdash;nor had he
said so, even in the way of joke&mdash;Spanker rarely says anything,
and was never known to joke&mdash;he abhors joking&mdash;he
can not imagine what it means. Spanker drives a buggy,
and suffers Quozzle to talk to him and to give him good advice.

<!-- page 129 -->

A world of wisdom has thus been addressed to Spanker,
and Spanker is remarkable for having kept it all to himself.
They are consequently well calculated to travel together, as
Quozzle does not keep a buggy for his own use, and as
Spanker can not always find a companion to ride out with
him. Quozzle criticises the construction of buggies and
theorizes upon the art of driving; Spanker continually keeps
saying nothing, and is rather soothed than otherwise by the
hum of Quozzle's voice, the idea not being suffered to
penetrate.</p>

<p>It was on an occasion of this sort, that Quozzle and
Spanker rode down to Point Breeze, it being Quozzle's
determination to let the folks thereabouts see how the noble
game of ninepins ought to be played. "I'll astonish 'em,
Spanker," said Quozzle, as he took his seat. But he did
not remain quiet long.</p>

<p>"See here, Bob," remarked Quozzle, "you don't know
how&mdash;upon my word you don't&mdash;see here, now&mdash;just lend
me the whip," and Quozzle took the instrument from his
hand&mdash;"now then&mdash;let's pass these fellows&mdash;you steer,
and I'll cut&mdash;there's nothing requires more judgment than
to cut at the right moment&mdash;there's a genius in cutting."</p>

<p>And, after causing the lash to whistle scientifically round
his head, Quozzle did "cut" with a vengeance. Spanker's
horse was indignant at the unwonted infliction and at the unpleasant
affliction; and, after rearing and plunging for a moment,
the outraged animal dashed forward with the speed of
lightning.</p>

<p>"Hold him in. Bob!&mdash;why don't you hold him in?"
screamed Quozzle; "why don't you stop him, as I tell you?"</p>

<p>"Why because I can't hold him in," replied the panting
Mr. Spanker, "and because he won't stop&mdash;he'll never stop
any more."</p>

<p>"Let me," cried Quozzle, somewhat alarmed at the extremity
of the danger, "let me&mdash;you don't know how&mdash;you
pull one rein, and I'll pull the other." But, as in such attempts

<!-- page 130 -->

it is difficult nicely to adjust the balance of power,
and to preserve a due equilibrium, the vehicle, naturally
enough, swung round as if on a pivot, dashing against the
market-cart of an old lady, from "down the neck." Now
any one who has happened to try the experiment, must be
perfectly aware that the delicate grace of a buggy, notwithstanding
its superior costliness, seldom comes in contact with
the masculine energy of a market-cart, without experiencing
some degree of detriment, while the cart itself cares little or
nothing about the matter. Bob Spanker's establishment
was doomed to realize the philosophical correctness of this
position, being, as it were, resolved into its original elements.
As for the horse, he set forth, rapidly enough, on an excursion
of pleasure, to be charged to his own individual account,
as he did not see that he could be of further use, under all
the circumstances of the case; and he carried two little bits
of shaft with him, as a relic of the catastrophe; leaving both
Quozzle and Spanker to repose ignominiously in the dust.</p>

<p>The old lady, in a charitable manner, placed a cabbage
under each of their heads, considering the vegetable to be
appropriately soft and calculated to sooth their anguish,
and they lay for a time, "like warriors taking their rest."</p>

<p>"Poor dears," cried the lady, benevolently, "I shouldn't
wonder if each of 'em had cracked his calabash, they came
down with such a squash. Before I could say beans, they
were both shelled out, and here they are; they sprung up
like a hopper-grass, but are cut down like a sparrow-grass."</p>

<p>"Who says I'm cracked?" gasped Quozzle; "I told him
what to do&mdash;but nobody knows what to do, and nobody
knows how to do it, when they are told, except myself&mdash;trust
'em and you're sure to be upset. Next time I must
cut and drive too!"</p>

<p>It was, therefore, evident enough, that whatever else might
be broken, Quozzle's organ of self-esteem remained unhurt,
proudly triumphing over the wreck of carriage and the crash
of cart. Whenever he alludes to the matter, he instances it

<!-- page 131 -->

as another evidence of the incapacity of other people to hold
the reins&mdash;nobody knows how to drive but himself. If
Spanker had followed his advice to "hold in," he is sure
that no mischief could have happened. But it is the inevitable
luck of the Quozzles to encounter mischance through the
inefficiency of other people&mdash;somebody else is always in
fault; and Quozzle is determined never again to take a
ride, unless he has the whole and sole control of the enterprise.
Spanker is of opinion that Quozzle should pay at
least half the damage; but Quozzle objects, on the ground
that he was only a passenger&mdash;according to his view, it is
a limited partnership in such cases, involving the invited
guest only to the extent of his neck.</p>

<p>DASHES AT LIFE:</p>

<p class="small">OR, SPLASHES IN PHILADELPHIA.</p>

</div>

<p>IT has always been a favorite scheme with the philanthropic
to provide bathing for the million, so that every one
at least once a week, should be enabled to enjoy the luxury
of a cold bath, in addition to the salutary effects of that species
of application; and accordingly, from time to time, a
multitude of plans have been proposed to accomplish that
desirable end, washing for the million! How much there is
of tonic influence in the idea? How the eyes sparkle and
the cuticle glows at the thought of these amphibious recreations.
Water is cheap&mdash;water is plenty&mdash;there are whole
rivers, lakes, oceans of water running to waste. But as civilized
man&mdash;man who must live in the close pent city, and
devote every waking hour to the toil of providing for subsistence&mdash;can
not well go to the water, and as the water
does not come to him in spontaneous lavations, this washing
for the million remains, throughout the world, rather a matter
of theory than of practice, and "the great unwashed" is
perhaps a phrase of as much import as when it was first
coined in derision of the unfortunate.</p>

<p>Thus it is everywhere&mdash;almost everywhere&mdash;indeed,
everywhere, except in Philadelphia. No one who walks
our streets can have reason justly to complain that there is
anything of niggardliness in the distribution of water hereabouts;
and whether you wish the footbath&mdash;pediluvium&mdash;or
a showery application to the head and shoulders, you may
be certain of it that your desires will be gratified to the utmost.

<!-- page 133 -->

In fact, it is not necessary to express a wish to
this effect. Solicitations are not at all required. It is
taken for granted here that everybody is in part amphibious&mdash;web-footed&mdash;and
therefore equally at home in either
element.</p>

<p>Come, then, to Philadelphia, if you would enjoy bathing for
the million, in its most perfect and widest application. If
you are dry and athirst&mdash;feverish possibly from a distempered
spirit, or ill-regulated diet&mdash;passionate and irascible,
from what cause you will&mdash;we would recommend an after-breakfast
saunter, especially through the streets where fashion
most resides. Observe, now&mdash;there's Sam with a hose
rising through the sidewalk&mdash;Sam's a colored gentleman,
and therefore fond somewhat of a little brief authority&mdash;Sam
converts the bricked footway, by these processes of irrigation,
into the loveliest miniature of a lake that can possibly
be imagined, while Peter with his broom is particularly
careful to scatter the waters far and wide, that he may discover
the degree of science in the art of dancing possessed
by each by-passer. But busy as they may be thus below, it
will be found that the series of hydropathic exercises is by
no means confined to the groundwork of things. In all likelihood,
Susan and Nancy are quite as busy at the windows
of the upper stories as Samuel and Peter have proved themselves
to be in the region of the basements; and consequently,
unless favored with that peculiarity of vision which
enabled one to glance simultaneously at earth and heaven,
"in fine phrensy rolling," as the poets have it, all the care
used in reference to our footsteps will prove unavailing to
save our bonnets or our hats. In one way, or in another,
we are irretrievably lost&mdash;splashed, drenched, ducked, destroyed!</p>

<p>Pooh!&mdash;talk of Venice&mdash;"I stood in Venice," and all
that, including Jaffier and Belvidera&mdash;what is Venice, aquatically,
when measured&mdash;liquid measure&mdash;"two pints make
a quart," and so forth&mdash;what is Venice, viewed in its hydraulic

<!-- page 134 -->

relationships, compared to our rectangular Philadelphia.
Venetian canals are slow and sluggish&mdash;but we dash
in Philadelphia, and we splash in Philadelphia, and emulate
the cataracts. Talk, will ye, of the "blue rushings of the
arrowy Rhone." Wait until you have experienced the rushings
of a bucketful of Schuylkill as it comes down sluicingly
from third stories; and then, and there, you will better understand
the force of projectiles and the peculiar beauties of
the "douche" as recommended by Priessnitz and the finny
followers of the school of Graefenberg. Venice, sayest thou?
Why ours are living waters that come down upon you, leaping
down, as it were, with loudest laughter, in the wildness
of their joy. We do not deny it that the gondola may be
swift as it glides beneath palace-wall&mdash;romantic, no doubt,
if the guitar tinkles and the verses of Tasso are sung; but
swift as the gondola may be, we are very sure it does not
hurry the passenger along so fast as the bucket and the dipper,
when judiciously applied; while the paddle and the oar are
weak indeed as a propulsive force compared to wet brooms
and twirling mops; and as for poetry&mdash;listen to the exclamations
of the drenched stranger, who has not yet learned
the art of navigation, and upon whom the floods come unawares.
There's poetry, my friend&mdash;the utterance of passion.
The Venetians, forsooth!&mdash;leave them to their stagnant
canals, and stroll with us through the streets of
Philadelphia, if you are an admirer of the picturesque and
would see water in all the varieties of its display. What is
there more graceful than water, unsophisticated water, as it
snorts in unaffected ease, and is thus careless of all observation?
Is it summer?&mdash;you may swim; be it winter&mdash;you
can slide; for the seasons make but little difference in our
fondness for the domestic deluge; and it is probably an effect
from this cause, that Philadelphia, with its multitudinous
spouts, has given so many actors to the stage.</p>

<p>But "enough of water hast thou, poor Ophelia;" and we
shall, therefore, bring our chapter to a close, desiring all to

<!-- page 135 -->

remember that so far as the use and the abuse of water are
concerned, we are disposed to yield to none. The Croton
itself can not bring our parallel of latitude in this respect;
and if it be your desire to get along swimmingly, come to
Philadelphia by all manner of means.</p>

<p>Still, however, the aquatic branches above alluded to, are
not all that spout and flourish in the streets of Philadelphia.
Formerly, the operations were confined to the sidewalks and
to the fronts of the houses; but now&mdash;such is the progress
of luxury&mdash;a new and extended method of irrigation is
adopted, by damming up the gutters during the dry and
dusty weather, that the somewhat discolored and rather unsavory
slackwater navigation, which is thus accumulated,
may be dispersed far, wide, and several times in the course
of the day, by the skilful and daring hand of some colored
contractor, in order that the pulverizations of mother earth,
so ground down and champed up to the minutest fineness by
the unceasing roll of omnibus and cart, may lie still and
slumber, for the exemption and the benefit of all the fancy
establishments of the fashionable streets. This is a new
peril added to the many which before beset our daily
walks; and lucky are they who contrive to pass along
unspotted from the world. The clear, fresh water is perhaps
bad enough; but when it comes to the kennels sown
broadcast, if we may be allowed the expression, one is to
be excused if some slight expression of annoyance escape
the lips.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary, therefore, to endeavor to delude us with
flaming placards about "cataracts of real water," or to strive
to draw us from our homes by talk concerning the wonders
in that respect which are to be seen in the course of travel.
We have all these things at home&mdash;displayed at our very
doors&mdash;surrounding our footsteps wherever we may chance
to go; and if any one desires to take preliminary lessons in
the art of "getting along," as practiced in the city of
"brotherly love," our advice may be briefly conveyed by

<!-- page 136 -->

reference to the engraving we have given. It requires much
natural agility&mdash;a bound, for example, as quick and as elastic
as the springing of the kangaroo&mdash;in eye quick to perceive,
conjoined to an ear which detects the faintest sound.
It is a species of ballet, demanding many classic <i>poses</i>, and
as great a variety of steps as ever emanated from the schools
of Taglioni, Elssler, or Cerito, it being taken for granted
that every one is acquainted with the customs of the country&mdash;that
none venture into the streets who are not capable of
taking care of themselves, or that they go forth fully prepared
for any of the consequences that may ensue. It will
not answer, therefore, to be so absorbed in self as to forget
all other circumstances, or else the absorption may be extended
in a manner more congenial to coolness than to comfort;
and so, if all the senses be not possessed in the highest
perfection&mdash;if you are not well qualified for the nicest personal
management, and are at the same time at all affected
by the "sad hydrofogie," a walk through the streets of Philadelphia,
especially of a Saturday, has as many perils as
spring from the uses of cold iron.</p>

<p>Cleanliness, they say, is next to godliness, and without a
doubt upon it, cleanliness is one of the most virtuous of all
the virtues. Hence&mdash;by splash of water&mdash;we of Philadelphia
are disposed to yield the palm to none in whatever goes
to make up the moral part of character. Do you impugn
our excellence&mdash;deride our benevolence&mdash;sneer at our honesty,
or find fault with our public spirit&mdash;do you so? Look
to the hydrants, the fire-plugs, the washers, and the scourers&mdash;then
assume it if you can, that a spot remains upon our
reputation. Not a stain could possibly maintain itself there
for the space of a single week, so obstinate are we in the
performance of our ablutions; and should posterity at all degenerate,
we place the picture given as an evidence on
record, that once at least we were the best-washed people
upon the face of the universal earth&mdash;second only to the
mermans and the mermaidens, who, we doubt not, would

<!-- page 137 -->

find in the Philadelphian a spirit congenial to their own,
though we do not often appear in public with a comb and a
mirror to warn the erring from the rocks. We are a nice
people&mdash;the fact is one that admits of no disputation; and
should a second deluge arise, we should be sadly disappointed,
if we were found unable to float upon the surges that
overwhelm those less happily constituted.</p>

<p>THE TRIALS OF TIMOTHY TANTRUM.</p>

</div>

<p>THAT's a Tantrum.</p>

No difficulty about it, at all. With ordinary discernment,
you may tell a Tantrum as far as you can see one, by the
distressed and dissatisfied expression of its countenance&mdash;"Tantrumical,"
if we may term it so. A numerous family,
too, these Tantrums&mdash;to be found everywhere in this vale
of tears; and few but happy are they who have neither temporary
attachment nor enduring relationship to the Tantrums.
Who is there, indeed, even among the most placid,
that is not more or less, and off and on, affected and afflicted
by the influence of the Tantrums? Bar the door as we may&mdash;resolve
against them as we will&mdash;the house, we fear, is
yet to be built which does not at times exhibit traces that
the Tantrums visit its fireside. It is difficult to rid ourselves
altogether of the Tantrums, even the wisest and firmest of
us; while some people are monopolized by Tantrum, in infinite
variety&mdash;Tantrumed beyond redemption, in every turn
of thought and change of feeling.</p>

<p>But this is only one of the Tantrums&mdash;a specimen number
of the whole work. It is TIMOTHY TANTRUM, the Man
of Trials; and perhaps&mdash;if you have tears&mdash;that is, for any
but yourself&mdash;prepare to shed them now&mdash;when Timothy
is to be spoken of, it would not be amiss&mdash;in the way of
condolings&mdash;to summon up the sob of sympathy, and to unfold
the handkerchief of tribulation. Timothy Tantrum&mdash;yea,
examine him physiognomically&mdash;is one of those unlucky
personages who are always under a shade, and who
are attended by a double allowance of shadow. They have

<!-- page 139 -->

no experience in sunshine, but dwell in the desolate regions
of perpetual cloud and everlasting storm. If it is not raining
there, it snows; and thus poor Timothy Tantrum carries
the atmosphere of sadness with him wherever he goes.
The barometer falls at his approach, down to "squally," or
thereabouts; and Timothy Tantrum presents himself to observation
as the inevitable individual who's always caught
in showers without an umbrella&mdash;the forlorn one, of a gusty
afternoon, that can not overtake an omnibus, and is "himself
alone" as he drips down the street. But what is Tantrum,
afloat, as it were&mdash;what is Tantrum to do? If he
should run now, all experience shows that the rain would
only come down the faster&mdash;the same quantity in a shorter
space of time; and if he were to wait for it to stop, they are
but little acquainted with the malign disposition of the elements
in their bearing on the Tantrums, who are yet to be
informed that it never stops when Tantrum is waiting.
"Rather than so," we should have a freshet, if not a deluge.
The shower makes it a point never to "hold up till
all the Tantrums who are out, are wet through and through&mdash;saturate,
Timothy and the rest&mdash;and it may be observed
to clear off, derisively, just as Timothy reaches home in a
state of damp.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you wait till the rain was over?"</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Timothy Tantrum wrings himself, with the grimmest of
smiles, but says nothing. Was there ever a rainbow&mdash;could
there be a rainbow&mdash;except at the instant when he had absorbed
the greatest possible quantity of moisture? There
is no such fact on record.</p>

<p>Unlike Napoleon, Timothy Tantrum has neither a sun of
Austerlitz, nor a "bright particular star," to his destiny&mdash;no
star at all, unless it be a star in eclipse, or on the principle
of Daggerwood's "moon behind a cloud." If he has a
star, it is a star of the funereal sort&mdash;a star with weepers,
shining black and radiating gloom. Luck!&mdash;has he luck?

<!-- page 140 -->

<p>It must be bad luck, then; and Timothy Tantrum considers
himself as a target, set up for the special purpose of being
shot at by the arrows of disaster, which hit him invariably,
whatever be the case with other people. Anything thrown
out as he comes along, is sure to go right into the eye of Mr.
Timothy Tantrum, the lineal descendant of that celebrated
sufferer in a similar way, who, if there be truth in epitaphs
met his fate "at the hands" of a sky-rocket. It had been so
with Tantrum, had he been there; and the other man would
have gone on his way rejoicing, with all his eyes in his head.</p>

<p>Tantrum's mind is of that peculiarity in grief, that it
seems to have "crape on its left arm," not "for thirty days"
alone, but for ever. It is always in mourning, and has no
associate except calamity. Should he be surprised and
overtaken, at an unguarded moment, by a laugh&mdash;ha ha!&mdash;he!
he!&mdash;ho! ho! and so forth&mdash;the outward and physical
expression of an interior and metaphysical hilariousness&mdash;it
would not only amaze his ears and astonish his unpractised
organs, but he would likewise be convinced that "something
is going to happen," of a kind calculated to translate
jocundity to the opposite side of the facial aperture, antipodean
to merriment; and he thus cuts the risible short off,
with a look of alarm, lest it should remind misfortune that
it had not yet completely annihilated Timothy Tantrum.</p>

<p>As a little boy&mdash;"Love was once a little boy," and so
was Timothy Tantrum&mdash;as a little boy, then, he never
went out without returning in a roar of grief, and in a tempest
of indignation, announcing to all the house that Tim&mdash;unhappy&mdash;was
again on hand&mdash;somebody had slapped Tim&mdash;or
somebody had tumbled Tim right into the kennel, Tim
having on his "Sunday's best," to go and see his grandmother,
illustrating the curious affinity between nicely
dressed children and the kennel&mdash;especially as regards the
Tantrum children&mdash;or else Tim's playthings had been
wrested from him&mdash;a big fellow had beaten Tim&mdash;spontaneously,
of course. For he&mdash;how could you wrong our

<!-- page 141 -->

Timmy so?&mdash;he had "done nothing to nobody"&mdash;he never
did "do nothing to nobody," according to his own account.
No! not even to the cur that barked at Tim, and wanted to
bite him; it being one of Tim's "features" to be always in
trouble, but never in the wrong. You see&mdash;a conspiracy
from the outset against Timothy Tantrum. The world had
determined, <i>ad initio</i>&mdash;that is, from the time he wore frock
and trowsers&mdash;to be continually pulling Timothy Tantrum
down, and never letting Timothy Tantrum up, the naughty
world, that always frowns on merit and persecutes the deserving.
Why won't it let the Tantrums alone?</p>

<p>Investigation, to be sure&mdash;but why investigate, to disturb
your conclusions?&mdash;might discover that "our Tim"&mdash;the
darling&mdash;had indulged a little in sauciness to lads not altogether
disposed to pocket it; or that, perchance, he had endeavored
playfully to abstract a cherished bone from curs
not given to the sportive mood. But here it is again, in
regard to the Tantrums&mdash;Tim was not comprehended and
understood. He had come in contact with inferior natures,
incapable of the requisite appreciation; and, as usual, no
allowances were made for the child, who only wanted to
have his own way, after the fashion of the Tantrums, and
asked for nothing more than that his way should be allowed
to take precedence of other people's ways; the trouble, from
first to last, arising from the oppugnation of obstinacy, which
forgets that the Tantrums are antagonistic by nature, and
can not get along at all except in the opposite direction&mdash;for
instance&mdash;right against you, and contrary to the general
grain. Now, it is a self-evident proposition, that if you and
the general grain are indisposed to yield&mdash;"about face,"
and so&mdash;the Tantrums are of necessity crossed, irritated,
and exasperated, and can have no peace because of your
belligerant habits of mind, which foolishly lead you to prefer
your own way to the way of the Tantrums&mdash;a way that
they know to be the right way; while your way&mdash;indisputably&mdash;is
the wrong way&mdash;the transgressive way.</p>

<!-- page 142 -->

<p>"But," as Timothy Tantrum has judiciously remarked, at
least a thousand times, "it is always cold when I wish it to
be warm; and warm invariably when I desire that it should
be cold. If I want to go out, then, of course, it's stormy&mdash;raining
cats and dogs; and when I don't care whether it's
clear or not, and would rather, maybe, that it was not clear,
why then it is as bright as a new button, as if it was laughing
at me. 'Spose I've no use for a thing&mdash;it's there, everlastingly,
right in the road&mdash;I'm tumbling over it a dozen
times a day. But when I do want that very thing, is it ever
in the way then? No, I thank you&mdash;no!&mdash;it wouldn't be
if it could. And when I hunt it up, if it allows itself to be
found at all, which it won't if it can help it, that thing is
morally certain to be the very last thing in the closet, or the
undermost thing in the drawer. It's the nature of things,
which are just as crooked and just as spiteful as people are.
Can anybody ever find his hat when there's a fire? Don't
the buttons disappear from sleeves and collars whenever
you're in a hurry to go to a tea-party? And at the very last
moment&mdash;the bell done ringing&mdash;all aboard&mdash;isn't something&mdash;the
very thing of all other things you ought to have&mdash;isn't
that thing sure to be a mile off, at home, grinning at
you from the mantel-piece?"</p>

<p>No wonder, then, that the Tantrums are always in despair.
Should Timothy be sent for in haste, the left boot is sure so
to offer itself that the right foot may be jammed fast in the
instep&mdash;owing, past doubt, to the constitutional perverseness
of boots, which, if they can not contrive to be too tight, and
to pinch you into misery, will manage it so as to come home
with a sharp peg in their sole, to harrow up your sole; and
which never will "go on" of a warm morning, until we have
toiled and tugged ourselves into fevers for the day. And
should Timothy, indignant and sudorific, should he, in a species
of retributive justice, jerk the aforesaid left boot from
his innocent right foot, to dash it&mdash;the boot, not the foot&mdash;across
the room, as some punishment to its untimely trickishness,

<!-- page 143 -->

did any one ever know that boot&mdash;still exemplifying
the perverseness of boots in particular, and of things in
general&mdash;to fail in jumping to the very place of all places
that it should not have gone to&mdash;the only place in the chamber
where it could upset a lamp or break a looking-glass?
But it is a folly to talk to boots&mdash;Tantrum swears at his, by
the hour, yet finds, after all, that boots are but boots.</p>

<p>It would be comparatively nothing, however, if such were
the limit of Tantrum's vexation. He might escape from
boots, and secure a shelter in slippers. But the hostile alliance
against him is comprehensive&mdash;it not only includes
all the departments of art, but likewise embraces the productions
of nature. Should Tantrum's arms stick in the
sleeve of Tantrum's coat&mdash;did that coat, in the pervading
treachery, and as he thrust his determined arm into it, hesitate,
if it were only for an instant&mdash;hesitate to rip in seam,
or refuse to tear in cloth, in a manner never practised by
well-behaved coats, and rarely by any coats at all, except
by the coats of the Tantrums? Was it not from the first
like an incubus on Tantrum's mind, that this coat would go
"all to flinders" on some occasion when he must have a
coat, and could get no other coat? Yes, this identical coat,
that positively would not come home, try all they would, for
weeks after it was promised, and appeared to resist every
effort at finishment.</p>

<p>And more&mdash;in the course of your acquaintance with the
Tantrums, you must have noticed, of a cold evening, when
Tantrum desired to "Adonise," that he might be intensely
agreeable to all beholders, and "lovelily dreadful" to the
ladies, that "that razor" would cut his chin in defiance of
all he could do to the contrary; and that, besides, the pitcher
would not have any water in it, the servant would be gone
out, and the way to the hydrant would be one glare of slippery
ice&mdash;a long, complicated conspiracy of things to defeat
Tantrum's hopes, and to disturb his complacency, if not to
give Tantrum a tumble. Nay, more&mdash;the very pitcher contrived

<!-- page 144 -->

to crack, and the basin went to fragments, merely to
aggravate Tantrum still farther, as he slapped them together,
in a well-founded scorn of their provoking emptiness; while
the candle, too&mdash;in emulation of the fires, and in imitation
of the servants&mdash;does it not "go out" whenever Tantrum
opens doors, or runs in agile movement up the stair? And
should he "send it flying"&mdash;as it so well deserves&mdash;they
have studied the characteristics of the candle to but little
profit, who do not expect, under these circumstances, to hear
a crash of valuables. Try it, if you are incredulous&mdash;just
leave a candle unwatched, and our life upon it, there will be
arson and incendiarism in a very little time. It has no
compunctions about setting the house afire, if it can, that
candle, meek and innocent as candles always look. Trust
them not!</p>

<p>While it is thus between the Inanimate and the Tantrums,
the case is but little better, as before hinted, between the
Animates and the Tantrums. Creation is a porcupinity,
with its sharp-pointed quills stuck out in all directions, impaling
the Tantrums at every movement they may chance to
make. The universe is a brambledom, for the scarification
of ankles; and whatever the hand of Tantrum falls upon,
what else can it be but a nettletop? It is all nettletop to the
Tantrums&mdash;for there is nothing innocuous unless we choose
to take it so; but the Tantrums will insist on it, that the innocuousness
shall be as they choose to take it, and that all
the smoothness is to be in their peculiar direction. In consequence
whereof, how the Tantrums suffer in this rasping,
sand-papered, gritty sphere of fret and friction, to which for a
time they are doomed, like Hamlet's ghost, "to fast in fires."</p>

<p>There is no accordance or concordance in it. We shall
find it a hopeless task, even the endeavor, simple as it may
appear, to induce any other man to wear his hat after the
excellent mode and fashion in which we wear our hat. And
yet why should he not? Tantrum, at least, can discover no
sufficient reason for the nonconformity; and he would, on

<!-- page 145 -->

philanthropic grounds alone, like to be armed with a power
to compel that other man to wear his hat correctly. "Any
man who persists in wearing his hat at such an angle as that,
after I have explained the matter to him, must be a fool, if
indeed he is not something a great deal worse;" and Tantrum
tells him so, in the plainest phrase, for the dissemination
of truth. The same rule, of course, holds good in politics,
and in all matters of practice and opinion. Yet when
Tantrum informs people of the fact, without circumlocution
or indirect phraseology, they quarrel with Tantrum, and call
Tantrum hard names, and say that they know as well as Tantrum
knows, and will continue to do as they please, without
the slightest regard to the principles laid down by Tantrum&mdash;and
so the world and its affairs go wrong, just as the world
and its affairs have always gone, and just as the world and
its affairs will continue to go, all the efforts of the Tantrums
to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

<p>"Where are you running to now?" cries Tantrum, sharply;
for this unremitting opposition, like a whetstone to the
knife, will set any one on edge.</p>

<p>"Home to dinner."</p>

<p>"Home to dinner! What do you have dinner at this time
for? This is no time for dinner. Look at me&mdash;I don't go
to dinner now. Never have dinner, I tell you, till you are
hungry. I don't&mdash;none but fools do!"</p>

<p>"But I am hungry now&mdash;I want my dinner."</p>

<p>"You can't be hungry&mdash;I'm not hungry&mdash;and how can
you be hungry? Do you think I don't know when I am hungry,
and when other people ought to be hungry? You're not
hungry&mdash;you can't be hungry. It's impossible. You pretend
to be hungry, out of spite&mdash;just because I'm not&mdash;that's
the way with everybody."</p>

<p>And so Tantrum falls out with Greedy, on the question
of appetite and the proper period of feeling a disposition to
dine, in which Greedy, like the rest of his class, proves to be
unconquerably obstinate. Greedy persists in going to dinner

<!-- page 146 -->

at an improper hour; and Timothy Tantrum is overwhelmed
with despair at the ignorant contumacy of the Greedies, who
have been the same ever since the days of Sir Giles Overreach.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>"I'm going to be married, Mr. Tantrum, and desire your
presence as groomsman."</p>

<p>"Going to be what?" exclaims Tantrum, in such tones of
scornful amazement as could scarcely fail to carry dismay to
the boldest heart, when placed in the trying position now referred
to&mdash;"Going&mdash;to&mdash;be&mdash;w-h-a-t?"</p>

<p>"Married," is the trembling response.</p>

<p>"Jinkins, I should be sorry to be forced, Jinkins, to class
you, too, among the fools; Jinkins&mdash;I should. Going to be
married, to be sure! Well!&mdash;I never! Jinkins, did you
ever know me to marry anybody? Jinkins, am I married,
Jinkins, or am I going to be? No, Jinkins, you may swear
to that!&mdash;and why should you? Don't, Jinkins&mdash;if you
value my friendship or my countenance."</p>

<p>But Jinkins insists on being married, in broad contradiction
to all that the Tantrums can say, resting his plea of palliation
and mitigation on the fact mainly that he is "in love"
an argument which Timothy Tantrum&mdash;like a genuine bachelor,
that pernicious species, who are thus by design, perhaps,
more than by accident, and who have been found audacious
enough to rejoice in their iniquity&mdash;treats with even less of
mercy than he does other differences of sentiment.</p>

<p>"If you are in love, why the shortest way is to get out of
it&mdash;I always do&mdash;and are you coming for to go for to set up
as wiser than I am?&mdash;as if I don't know. And who do you
propose to marry, I should like to learn? Susan Scissors!
Good gracious&mdash;what a choice! I wouldn't have Susan
Scissors&mdash;am I in love with Susan Scissors? Did you ever
know me to marry Susan Scissors? Why should you? I
really can't understand it. To marry, is bad enough of itself!
But Susan Scissors&mdash;whew!"</p>

<p>And hereupon arose another contention and another division,

<!-- page 147 -->

because Timothy Tantrum was hostile to matrimony in
general, and to Susan Scissors in particular&mdash;forgetting, in
the first place, that everybody, except the Tantrums, will
marry, it being a way they have; and that, in the second
place, it will not do for all the world&mdash;the masculine world&mdash;to
affect and to fancy the same individual&mdash;Susan Scissors,
or another&mdash;it might lead to trouble.

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>"That's not the way to bring up a child," says Tantrum;
"I wouldn't educate him so. Did you ever know me to fetch
up a child that way, a spilin' of him, as you do?"</p>

<p>"I never saw you bring up children at all, unless knocking
'em down, when they come crying in your way, is what
you call bringing 'em up."</p>

<p>"What I mean is&mdash;do you think that's the way I'd bring
'em up, if I was to bring 'em up? I'm not such a goose.
Did you ever see me"&mdash;</p>

<p>And then Tantrum would enlarge upon his theory of training
and instruction, until he found that parents and guardians
were quite as rigid in the wrong, and quite as fond of their
own erroneous conclusions as all the rest of society. In this
regard, there was no solace for Tantrum but in one fond expectation.</p>

<p>"Those children will all go to the mischief, that's one great
and glorious consolation&mdash;the girls will run off with some big-whiskered,
mustached, long-legged, and long-nosed swindler,
who'll beat 'em well, and send 'em home at last, with large
families of little people&mdash;that's one of the consequences of
not minding me. And as for the boys, those that don't disappear
some day, nobody knows where, may be looked for
in the penitentiary, never coming to no sort of good; and
then I can drop in sociably to inquire about them at home,
and the way I'll ask the folks if they 'marked my words'
when I said how it would end, will be what they won't forget
in a hurry&mdash;I can promise them that beforehand!" and
Tantrum for once chuckled with glee.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>In the affairs of medical science, also, Timothy Tantrum

<!-- page 148 -->

was equally learned, but as equally unfortunate. But, as
nobody would pursue his system of practice, he still consoled
himself with giving the recusants a bit of his mind, which is
not often the most agreeable present that can be bestowed&mdash;and,
in the second place, should the results prove fatal, as
results sometimes will, why didn't Timothy Tantrum say how
it would be?</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But no man is altogether without refuges and resources&mdash;we
all have something to fall back upon; and Timothy Tantrum,
in the midst of the contumelies of an unappreciating
world, where none will do as he thinks every one should do,
derives solace and refreshment for his spirit by going a fishing,
alone by himself, with a patent-rod and a red cork. When
he succeeds in setting the household by the ears, and has
got the whole neighborhood comfortably in an uproar, he
then&mdash;quietly&mdash;like Sylla abdicating&mdash;travels off to fish.
Fishes have this advantage as companions&mdash;they bite, and
say not a word; or, if they do not bite, they never make
jeering remark, or indulge in provoking argument; so that
one may be as philosophical and as splenetic as he likes
when he is fishing, without risk of being "aggravated." But
even here, drawbacks to the perfect felicity will intrude themselves.
We want to catch a fish, it may be; and that fish,
however sensible in the main, has not arrived at a perfect
conclusion in himself whether he is hungry or not, coquetting
with the bait, yet refusing it&mdash;ungrateful fish, after so much
trouble has been encountered for his especial entertainment.
There is a crookedness, too, in hooks, that attaches itself to
weeds and roots, if not to garments, and to the fleshy integuments
beneath. But worse than all is it when we&mdash;the
Tantrums&mdash;are established in just the sort of nook we have
been looking for all day, to be pounced upon in our soliloquies
by some ragged and vociferous urchin, with a ponderous dog
of the amphibious breed, who will have it that Carlo shall
"go in and fetch it out," right upon our piscatorial premises,

<!-- page 149 -->

to our discomfiture and to that of the finny tribes&mdash;Carlo,
who surges like a diving elephant, and who comes out to shake
himself at our elbow, like the spray of cataracts. And Nicodemus
swims horses, too, at the same appalling instant. Who
can be surprised that Timothy Tantrum, in an effort to better
his condition, broke his patent angling-rod in an ineffectual
blow at the aforesaid ragged and vociferous urchin, or that he
fell into the creek by an injudicious striving to administer a
kick to the ponderousness of Carlo? Both of these movements
were natural enough; and the consequent disasters,
what were they but a link in the chain of annoyance connected
with the life and misfortunes of the Tantrum family?</p>

<p>"Just exactly what was to be expected," growled Tantrum,
as he wandered home, moist and disconsolate; "it's always
so when I undertake to teach manners to boys and genteel
behavior to the dogs. My best intentions are thrown away,
on everybody. I've broke my rod, and the boy's not a bit
the wiser; I've tumbled in the creek, and the dog's as impolite
as ever. And now, I've a great mind to let everybody and
everything take its own course, without bothering myself any
more. I don't see that I've got anything yet for my pains,
though I've fretted all my hair off, and scolded my teeth out.
It's easier, I guess, and more profitable, to make the best of
things as they are, now I find that they won't be any other
way; and I would, if it wasn't that I know I know better about
things than other people&mdash;what's the use of knowing you
know better, if you don't make other people know you know
so? Whatever is, is wrong&mdash;all but me&mdash;I'm clear as daylight
as to that; but I won't cry about it any longer. Perhaps
when Timothy Tantrum's dead and gone, they'll begin to discover
there was somebody here when he was alive. But they
won't before, for they haven't yet&mdash;they're too obstinate&mdash;and
while I'm waiting to be understood and appreciated, I'm
half inclined to begin to take the world easy, and enjoy myself,
like the foolish people, who don't know any better."</p>

<p>THE LIONS OF SOCIETY:</p>

<p class="small">POTTS, PETERS, AND BOBUS.</p>

<p class="small">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"Another lion gave a grievous roar;<br/>

And the first lion thought the last 'a bore.' "<br/>

BOMBASTES FURIOSO.</p>

</div>

<p>LIONS!&mdash;yes&mdash;every collection, zoological or otherwise,
must have its lions. Without them, it is incomplete&mdash;deficient
in what may be termed its rallying point or nucleus.
What, for instance, would be the menagerie&mdash;and it is, more
or less, all menagerie, "here upon this ground"&mdash;without a
smart sprinkling of lions? We admit that the elephant is a
respectable, solid individual, in his way&mdash;prosy, however,
and not at all of a sparkling nature. And your monkey,
provided he be not sick&mdash;there is nothing sadder than your
sick monkey&mdash;monkeys ought to be exempt from sickness&mdash;he
may be droll, as he catches the apple or cracks a nut&mdash;doleful
drollery though, as that drollery must ever be in
which we discover how narrowly the most of us escaped
from being monkeys. But still, these things&mdash;monkey,
elephant, and all&mdash;can not satisfy the reachings of the soul;
and we turn from them in weariness to ask, "where is the
lion?&mdash;let me hear a lion roar!" We are imposed upon,
if we can not find a lion.</p>

<p>And so it is in the circles of society. Each must be provided
with its lion. Nay, it is indispensable that there should
be several lions, of different forces and dimensions, to vary
the scene, or to be produced in the absence of each other.
But not two of a similar kind, at the same moment. Such
lions never agree, on account of that dislocation of noses, to

<!-- page 151 -->

which, by such collision, they become subject; and if you
have ever noticed the fact&mdash;perhaps you have felt it, as all
of us play the lion's part, more or less, at intervals&mdash;but if,
either way, you may chance to have observed it, this truth
is familiar, that there is nothing more dangerous than a lion
with his "nose out of joint."&mdash;The moody ferociousness
exhibited under such circumstances, is a matter which, according
to the popular phrase, is not to be sneezed at, even
by one who happens to be worse off than the aggrieved lion
himself, in the delicate particular of noses. A lion's nose is
his thermometer of health and barometer of temper.&mdash;Put
that out of place&mdash;ay, but sprain a lion's nose, however
slightly, and the attempt to play with him is a fearful risk.
He is sure to snap your nose off.</p>

<p>To know a lion&mdash;what may be described as a good sizeable
lion&mdash;such a one as plays the lion, wherever he goes&mdash;among
the "upper ten thousand," or amid the substratum
of "the masses"&mdash;one of your dauntless lions, who confidently
sports his mane and his claws in all possible situations,
and has that pervading sense of his own immensity,
that he is the lion&mdash;equally&mdash;at your house, or at home&mdash;in
the kitchen&mdash;for even the kitchen has its lions&mdash;or in the
presence of all imaginable quantities of wisdom, wit, beauty,
rank and fashion&mdash;there being "comparative lions," who
lionize according to the chance&mdash;but we allude to the
"positive lion," who is invariably himself&mdash;if you would
know him, then, the discovery may be made in various ways.
When you feel patronized, as it were, in society, and can not
tell exactly why, as you do not seek for patronage particularly,
at that moment, a shrewd suspicion may be indulged that
you are in the presence of a lion. A lion, too, condescends&mdash;his
whole deportment announces the fact to the bystanders
that "now the lion condescends," for the encouragement of
people&mdash;little people&mdash;such as have nothing of the leonine
growth about them. The lion pats, that you may not be too
much overcome by his austere dignity&mdash;he will not eat you

<!-- page 152 -->

up&mdash;though he could do it, and he wishes you to see that
he knows he could do it&mdash;he is not hungry now, the amiable
lion. But the undoubtable sign that Leo approximates&mdash;if
it be not felt mesmerically&mdash;is in the eclipse that falls
around. No one now says, "how dee do-o," to you&mdash;give
it up at once, loquacious friend&mdash;nobody listens to your
narrative&mdash;your pun provokes no smile&mdash;your jest can
draw no laughter. But a few moments since, perhaps, and
you were in feather&mdash;a larger estimate than usual of the
entertaining qualities which you had derived from nature,
began to warm your heart and stimulate your brain&mdash;a
thought, perchance, that if not a whiskered lion of the tribe&mdash;adult,
mature, consummate&mdash;you were at least a promising
cub of the same species. But now, how shrunk&mdash;what an
insignificancy of contraction!&mdash;The matter?&mdash;Can't you
see?&mdash;Why, man, the lion's come&mdash;the lion past dispute&mdash;the
real, uncontested thing. There is a dislocation, for
the time, of your beloved nasal promontory. Go&mdash;for now
you are "no go"&mdash;the game is up. Our meaning here is
aptly illustrated by the accompanying engraving, and which
might properly be termed, "<i>A Discomfiture of the Lesser
Lions; or, the Extinction of the Rushlights.</i>"</p>

<p>There was a gathering at Brown's&mdash;of beauty and of
chivalry, as any one may see. Potts was there, and Peters&mdash;social
lions of the smaller growth. Potts did the sublime
and beautiful&mdash;Potts is literary&mdash;and Peters was strong
upon the queer and quaint&mdash;Peters is a wag. Never was
there a more delightful party. Potts talked romance and
reason, politics, poetry, and polemics&mdash;soaring upward&mdash;wondrous
Potts!&mdash;like an eagle from its eyry; and Peters
followed, quizzical, playing upon words in the centre of
"Giggledom." Potts secured the solid sense of the meeting&mdash;the
matrons circled round him&mdash;bald heads and spectacles
were there, to feed on wisdom. "A great man is Potts,"
said they; "sensible to the last;" and Potts grew wiser
as he glanced reprovingly back to "Giggledom"&mdash;listen

<!-- page 153 -->

young ladies, and be improved&mdash;where Peters flashed and
coruscated like the uncorking of champagne. A funny man
was Peters then, and "Giggledom" rejoiced. The more
philosophical Potts became, the wittier was Peters, as if
these antagonist forces acted and re-acted on each other to
the production of a power which neither had exhibited before.
Potts, indeed, thought that if it were possible for man
to be more rational, acute, and sagacious, than he now proved
himself, it would scarce be possible for such a man to live,
and that when he died, as die he must, the world would cut
him up into schools, colleges, and other seats of learning and
profundity&mdash;he felt convinced, moreover, that it would,
when he was out, be advisable always to have reporters near,
that he might be published&mdash;a serial&mdash;in continuous number,
at a fip a week, as a living "Library of Useful Knowledge."
Potts could not admire himself enough, as by far
the ablest individual that he ever knew&mdash;while Peters was
assured, that if he (Peters) should get any funnier as the
night wore on&mdash;he did not believe it possible&mdash;there never
was anything funnier&mdash;but if he (Peters) should grow funnier&mdash;and
it would not be practicable for him (Peters) to
help it&mdash;why then it would be impossible for other folks to
live. He (Peters) would be the death of them. Somebody
ought to hold him (Peters)&mdash;in mercy, hold him.</p>

<p>Both Potts and Peters were impressed with a full belief,
that clever&mdash;English clever&mdash;as they always were, still on
this memorable evening, they were&mdash;Potts to Potts and
Peters to Peters&mdash;immeasurably superior to themselves.
Potts, in short, was not sure whether it was himself or not;
and Peters escaped the doubt only from knowing that he could
not easily be any one else, or rather, that it was out of the
question for any one else to be him. How pleasant it is to
be satisfied that no other person can be you&mdash;that you are
unique.</p>

<p>But suddenly&mdash;a catastrophical suddenly&mdash;in walked
Bobbs&mdash;"B. Bobus Bobbs, Esq."&mdash;"Goodness, gracious,

<!-- page 154 -->

if here isn't Bobbs!&mdash;my!&mdash;I thought Bobbs would never
come! Oh! how glad&mdash;Bobbs!&mdash;such a pleasure&mdash;Bobbs!&mdash;quite
delighted&mdash;Bobbs!"</p>

<p>"As I was saying," continued Potts, beginning to quail,
"as I was about to say, to show the rationale of the matter
Mrs. Brown&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind now, Mr. Potts," rejoined Mrs. Brown,
"there's Bobbs at last;" and Mrs. Brown darted away,
leaving Potts in soliloquy.</p>

<p>"But the best of the joke was, ladies," whimpered Peters,
under a foreknowledge of his fate, "the best of the joke&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bobbs!" ejaculated the young ladies, wild with delight,
and Peters was alone.</p>

<p>"Potts!&mdash;Bobbs!" said Peters.</p>

<p>"Peters!&mdash;Bobbs!" replied Potts.</p>

<p>And on reference again to the picture, their relative expressions
may be seen, Potts endeavoring to muster courage
to stand his ground&mdash;Peters getting indignantly out of the
way. Bobbs is the largest lion of the town, and they know
it. Bobbs, who is as philosophical and as funny as both
Potts and Peters combined, is evidently provoked at their
presumption in his absence; and Potts and Peters, after
vainly endeavoring to resist the current of opinion by sly insinuations
against the merits of Bobbs, at last betake themselves,
silently and sullenly, to chicken salad in a corner.
Always retreat on chicken salad.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Lions are diverse and different. There is your musical
lion, who is sometimes a bore&mdash;your scientific lion, who is
apt to be an ass&mdash;your political lion, who is frequently a
nuisance, and your funny lion, who, on occasion, is dull
enough. The handsome lion is not often endurable; but the
dandy lion is at least harmless if he pays his tailor's bill.
And following these, we find literary lions, gymnastic lions,
lions in buggies and on horseback&mdash;fast-trotting lions, are
they&mdash;military lions&mdash;in fact, every jungle has its lion, big

<!-- page 155 -->

or little&mdash;not one of which, except as aforesaid, in the way
of condescension, will permit others to slip in a word edgewise.
Those who are not lions themselves, are born for no
other purpose but to admire the lions. Gentle reader, if
you are not a lion already, try to be a lion, with all your
might and "mane."</p>

<p>DAVID DUMPS,</p>

<p class="small">THE DOLEFUL ONE.</p>

</div>

<p>THE majority of people are in the Dumps only at times&mdash;the
most stormy of lives has its gleams of sunshine, and
perhaps there are few among men whose existence is a night
so dark that no star of hope appears. Even melancholy itself
has its reactions, as the criminal on the rack is said to sleep
in the intervals of torture, and thus to gain strength for added
suffering. One can not be always weeping, and there must
be a pause in sorrow. The Dumps then, as a general thing,
do not prevail in every bosom without the grace of intermissions
of relief; and, for the most part, there is quite as much
of smiles and laughter in this world, as there is of doleful
groaning. You, for instance, are in tears to-day, while your
neighbor jests right merrily, the loud outbreak of his mirth
jarring on your lacerated nerves, as you wonder how it is
that men can thus be "pleased with a rattle, tickled with a
straw," while you suffer like Guatemozin on his bed of coals.
But be then of good heart, friend&mdash;let not the soul within
thee break down as without hope. It may be but a little
time&mdash;a week, perchance&mdash;a month then&mdash;or what if it be
a year&mdash;before you shall be as gamesome as a kid, while the
dark shadow of tribulation rests upon your neighbor's head.
All evils cure themselves in one way or another. A grief
can not be eternal, or if the evil must endure, why, we grow
callous at the last, and cease to feel its pressure. That is,
the most of us are in this way affected, having the Dumps
only upon occasion, to give effect by the force of contrast, as
it were, to the more pleasant passages of our career on earth.

<!-- page 157 -->

All sights and sounds can not for ever remain as disagreeable
to you as they now appear&mdash;the light of the blessed sun
shall not always be more oppressive than the darkness, which
it chases away; and depend upon it, unlikely as the realization
of the promise now seems, we all may smile again.</p>

<p>All smile again&mdash;yes, all but David&mdash;he never has smiled
yet&mdash;how can he smile again? David has no lot or part in
such business. His life is a matter far too serious for trifling
divertisement of that sort; and we doubt whether cranks
or pulleys, or any of the complex arrangement of rope, block,
and tackle, could be made to elevate the corners of his downcast
mouth even to the level of a simper. Archimedes himself,
with all the resources of mechanical invention, must fail
in the effort to extend the corners aforesaid from ear to ear,
according to the practice of most people when tickled by a
conceit; and were his countenance thus forcibly opened by
crowbar or by cable, what good could it possibly do when
David's vocal apparatus is altogether incompetent to the
formation of those sounds which are indicative that fun holds
revel in the halls of the brain? Nay, David would thus look
sadder far than ever he did before&mdash;for what is more sad&mdash;more
chillingly melancholy, than the mere forms and semblances
of smile and mirth when the soul denies illumination?
It is the ghastly grinning of a skeleton&mdash;the cadaverous expression
of a corpse&mdash;we pray you to let that mouth&mdash;the
mouth of David&mdash;let it alone as it falls. We doubt whether
any change that you could make, would be at all for the better.
Gloomy as the natural David may appear, there are no
artificial arrangements that can be contrived to improve him.
Rouge to his cheek or roses in his hair, would that afford to
David a more cheerful aspect?&mdash;Do not think it.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is, that while you or I, in the way
of recreation are temporarily miserable and occasionally distressed,
the miserables and the distresses are David's natural,
habitual, and original condition. For his name is Dumps&mdash;David
Dumps, at your service&mdash;not Dumps now or Dumps

<!-- page 158 -->

then; but invariably Dumps, suing and sued in that delightful
name. When constables apprehend him, they soon comprehend
that they have the Dumps. Having commenced
crying at his first appearance on the stage of life, as nearly
everybody does&mdash;"our pilgrimage begins in tears"&mdash;Dumps
has gone directly onward in the same strain of dolor as at
first&mdash;weeping, and wailing, and gnashing his teeth, as he
passes by. He cries aloud at all times and seasons, so that
he is "like loftiest peaks," surrounded by fogs and mists impenetrable
to the sun of gladness. His summit is a glacier
where nothing grows, and the brightest beams of noon only
thaw tears away, which do not improve the general aspect.</p>

<p>Dumps&mdash;David&mdash;has it in his power&mdash;for he continually
exercises himself in the art&mdash;to sorrow over all things;
but what especially provokes him, and he falls back upon it
as a species of reserve in the battle of life, when no particular
distress sets in to goad his sides, is the general unhappiness
of human condition, as compared to the "jolly times,"
to use his own phraseology, which the inferior animals have
of it.</p>

<p>"Dave&mdash;you, Dave&mdash;it's time to get up and kindle the
fire! Get up, this minute, and don't make me come there
after you."</p>

<p>Now such a call as this, of a bitter cold morning&mdash;in a
room uncarpeted, with the outward atmosphere whistling in
through chinks and crannies, and penetrating broken panes,
ill stopped by antiquated hats and rejected trowsers, can not
be regarded as a musical call, even if uttered by the sweetest
of voices&mdash;for David Dumps was coiled up warmly, forgetting
his sorrows in the depths of slumber, and bidding
them defiance in a snore as haughty and fearless as the
sonorous brass of bold dragoonery.</p>

<p>"You, Dave!"</p>

<p>"Augh-waugh," responded Dave.</p>

<p>Words, you know, are idle in an emergency&mdash;who wastes
words in a crisis such as this? The next thing David knew

<!-- page 159 -->

was the unwelcome visitation of a sufficient quantity of the
coldest water to his sublime but sleeping countenance; and,
as the usual result in all aquatic and amphibious experiments
of this sort, David sat bolt upright and wide awake at once.</p>

<p>"Now, make the fire, or you shall have some more water."</p>

<p>There are two ways of impressing the memory. A congenial
association of ideas will do it; and so will the most
diverse and opposite commingling of thoughts. There is a
sharp, pungent irony in dashing one's face with cold water
to make one get up to kindle the fire, which prevents the
hint from being wasted. In such a case, it is not easy to
forget, though even the meekest spirit lodged in the thickest
skin, is apt to feel vengeful and resentful, on such occasions;
and if you are the person who distributed the water, take
timely care that the ways of swift retreat are clearly open
behind you&mdash;for we have known disaster to be the result of
oversights in this respect. To be drifted from slumber by
water conveyance, never yet soothed anybody's temper&mdash;the
mildest are apt to swear&mdash;the most peaceful will become
belligerent. 'Tis best to evaporate at the instant of the
sprinkle, before eyes are opened wide enough to take an
aim with boot, or shoe, or clothes-brush. No fear that the
sleeping will be resumed.</p>

<p>David did arise, like a mermaid or a river-god, but in no
gentle frame of mind. As he always got up crossly, and
with emotions somewhat savage at being obliged again to
mingle with life's harsh realities, he was as near frantic now
as may be. To make the fire was an imperative necessity,
and it was made with that commingling of "fire and fury,"
which furnishes evidence of the sulkiness and aggravation
that reign within. The pussy that purred in the corner&mdash;the
dog that stretched upon the hearth, both received abrupt
evidences that David Dumps was in a state of extreme displeasure.</p>

<p>But it so happened that, as he struck them, an idea struck
him, as if the collision had elicited a spark which fired up

<!-- page 160 -->

the magazine of his brain. But, account for it as you may,
there can be no doubt of the fact, that Dumps did catch an
idea at the aforesaid moment. Not an idea of the ordinary
description, such as are continually tumbling through men's
minds, leaving no impression of any value behind them&mdash;ideas
that would not bring sixpence for a hundred in the intellectual
market, and which are by no means a fruitage worthy
of any species of preservation; but an idea of that grand
and comprehensive force of generalization, which set David
Dumps up in business as a philosopher for the rest of his
life, rendering him as nearly good for nothing, as his most
ardent admirer could desire. It was a leading idea, to which
David Dumps could bend all things, and from which he
could, at any moment, deduce the most bitter of dissatisfactions.
David stood with his mouth open to its full extent
that the idea aforesaid, as it knocked against his cranium for
admission, might be swallowed whole, which, possibly, is the
reason why so many people open their mouths extensively
at strange sights and unaccustomed words, the eye and the
ear not being sufficient to receive the impression. Always,
therefore, do the like when you wish to understand anything
completely, and wear your mouth ajar at all times and seasons;
for who knows what you may catch, if the trap be
always set and ready to spring upon anything that passes.</p>

<p>But when David Dumps felt that he had secured the new
idea, he shut his mouth with a snap, to make all safe, that his
new idea might not fly out again as rapidly as it had gone in.
Besides, he had gained wisdom enough for one day&mdash;as
much, indeed, in his private opinion, as others collect in the
whole course of their mortal lives; and he felt also that, perchance,
he might injure himself and bring on mental dispepsia,
if there should be any sudden addition to the dose of
wisdom which he had just taken. We must allow due time
for the new idea to become assimilated to the old stock of
intelligence, before we increase the supply, or the whole
establishment may be thrown into inexplicable confusion.

<!-- page 161 -->

<p>"Some people," remarked David, after a long pause, in
the course of which his nose hitched itself into wrinkles of
supreme contempt, "some people never know nothing more
than they know'd at first&mdash;they only know what they are
told, and couldn't find a thought for themselves if it was a
laying right before them squeaking to be taken up. There's
not many that ever ketch an idea on their own hook; and
they couldn't, if ideas were as thick as huckleberries on a
bush. It takes such folks as me, who have heads for use
and not for show, to discover the wisdom that's to be found
in things. And so, while other people are laughing and rejoicing
in their foolishness, because they can't see straight,
you may hear me groaning at least a mile off, because I can
see right through everything.</p>

<p>"Now as to them dogs and them cats. It appears to me,
though I can't say I ever heard 'em at it&mdash;but it appears
to me that they must be laughing at us all the time&mdash;for
they are always idling or sleeping or feeding at our cost and
expense, while we are at work from the time we get up till
we go to bed again. What do they do, I'd like to know,
but can&oelig;uvre round to enjoy themselves, while we have to
get up and make fires, and cook wittals as much for them as
for ourselves?&mdash;Oh, yes&mdash;yarn and stretch, doggie&mdash;look
at me lazy with your eyes half shut, for its me that's at work,
not you. And now the fire burns a little, down you go in the
warmest corner, as if you were one of the upper ten-thousanders,
and had your boots cleaned every day by a colored
pussun. You don't have to pay taxes, nutther, nor milishy
fines&mdash;we have to go to market for you and let you in when
you scratch at the door. And so, get out, warmint!" and
David lent the dog another kick&mdash;kicks being always lent,
as the greatest favor, while blows, being cheaper, are freely
given&mdash;lent the dog another kick, which put to flight at once
not only the quadruped itself, but likewise all that quadruped's
serenity of mind, while the cat, as another of the aristocratic

<!-- page 162 -->

circles, met with very nearly a similar fate, both retiring with
doleful lamentations.</p>

<p>"That's some comfort anyhow&mdash;if I can't make you work,
I can make you sing out, which is very nigh as good;" and
so with some slight emotion of pleasure, down sat David
Dumps, to warm himself and meditate still further upon the
idea which he had partially broached as above, that in the
main, the beasts, and the birds, including the fishes, are much
better off in this world than David Dumps or any of his kind.</p>

<p>And it is a favorite topic of discourse with him even now,
when grown unto man's estate of length of limb and anxiety
of mind&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Lord of himself, that heritage of wo"&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>his thoughts are full of the injustices of natural history;
and if it were not that through man's peculiar cunning, some
part of the animal creation has nearly as hard a time of it as
Dumps himself, it is a doubt whether Dumps would consent
to remain in the world at all, if he could find any particularly
easy and pleasant way of getting himself out of it.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A cigar-shop is the natural resort of the meditative and
inquiring. Smoke and speculation combine in perfect beauty,
while the argument and the tobacco consume themselves
together, leaving little but ashes behind. Men of the thinking
sort, are fond of congregating of evenings at the cigar-shop,
where and at which time, politics, war news, anecdote,
and metaphysics, are particularly rife. Yes, if you would
note the current feature of the time, go to the barber's in the
morning, and stop for your cigars at night.</p>

<p>The cigar is the smoke pipe of the great social locomotive,
and puffs it along, giving force to thought and fluency
to expression. No great plan is laid&mdash;no grand project
conceived, without the agency of cigars&mdash;at all "preparatory
meetings," where two or three concoct public opinion for

<!-- page 163 -->

the masses, the cigar opens the debate and sharpens the wit
for discussion. Smoke, smoke is the mighty propulsive force
of our country; and things will never go quite properly until
the judge lights his regalia on the bench, and the juror sports
his favorite brand in the box. Then, and not till then, will
justice go like smoke.</p>

<p>Is talking your forte?&mdash;go to the cigar-shop, that you
may be sure of an audience. Would you rather listen to the
experiences of others, get thee to the cigar-shop, for budding
oratory there holds forth, with chequers, perchance, or
dominoes, in the little back-room. David Dumps is, of
course, a smoker&mdash;a man of sorrow is almost always a man
of addiction to the weed, for what of comfort can he elsewhere
find?</p>

<p>And so in full divan, seated beneath the wooden Highlander,
who is always taking snuff, there&mdash;even there at
Quiggs's cigarrery, David Dumps had broached it as a truth
not to be controverted, that with the exception of his ignorance
of the various uses of the divine weed, it were better
to be a dog than such a Roman.</p>

<p>"That's my candied opinion, any how," said Dumps, doggedly,
almost barking as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Nothin's never right with Dumps," observed a fat
gentleman with a rosy physiognomy, who looked as if
everything agreed with him, just as he agreed with everything.</p>

<p>"Dumps, Dumps, Dumps," remarked another individual,
with a considerable quantity of whisker, round which the
smoke curled as if they were burning brush on the premises;
"Dumps, what possible use can there be in your groaning
all the time over what can not be helped?&mdash;It's very clear
to me, Dumps, that you were not born to set the world to
rights, and to fix everything over again just to suit yourself.
It wouldn't be fair, Dumps, you see, even if it could be done,
because may be, I shouldn't like it then any more than you
like it now; and so, every man would be obligated to have a

<!-- page 164 -->

little world all to himself; and hire a star to live in, the same
way that people hire houses, paying rent by the quarter.
See here, Dumps&mdash;if you happen to know any man that's
rich enough to keep a grindstone, you had better go and have
yourself made a little smoother about the edges. You're
so rough now, that you hurt yourself and everybody else.
If the world don't suit you, there's nothing for it but to make
yourself suit the world. That's the way I do."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Dumps&mdash;try to be a man," remarked another&mdash;"be
a reasonable critter, that puts up quietly with what
he can't help&mdash;for Dumps, you'll find that you must put up
with it whether or no, and growling is just so much of labor
wasted. Wise folks never complain&mdash;they go right off and
get a cigar or a fip's worth of cavendish, to sooth the feelin's.
Be a man, Dumps&mdash;a reasonable critter."</p>

<p>"A man, indeed," retorted Dumps, morosely rejoiced at
the opportunity thus afforded to ring in his favorite idea&mdash;"a
pretty thing to be proud of&mdash;being a man. Why, what's
a man, I'd like to know, to have to work and to scramble
all the time for a miserable living, and then not to be able
to get more than half a one, if you get that?&mdash;For my part,
I'd be anything rather than a man. Nobody has good times
in this world but the unreasonable critters, and they make
their living easy.&mdash;Tell me, now, who asks a bird to pay up
for what he wants?&mdash;He has no bill to trouble him but his
own bill&mdash;that's his due-bill. The cats, and the dogs, and
the cattle&mdash;they play all the time if they want to&mdash;sleep
and play. If it wasn't that the city-dogs has hard times of
it in summer, when they're out and forget their muzzles,
I'd get right down on all fours and bark&mdash;I'd join the
bow-wow chorus, as the only free and independent set that's
going."</p>

<p>"But the horses, Dumps, and the mules, and the oxen&mdash;they
are not much better off than you are."</p>

<p>"Very true; and there's some little comfort in that, as
there is in a peep at the menagerie where they stir up the

<!-- page 165 -->

animals and make them roar and growl for a living, like the
tragedians at the theatre, though the animals don't get so
much for the job. But that has nothing to do with the general
principle, that in this world the reasonable critter has
decidedly the worst of it in every possible p'int of view. Oh,
what a blessed thing it would be, if we lived by suction, and
had feathers&mdash;that's the grand idea I'm driving at&mdash;nateral
clothing&mdash;spontaniferous jackets, and free gratis trowsaloons,
with nothing to do but open our mouths when we want our
dinner. Do chickens learn a trade, and are cockrobins
bound 'prentice? Are calves sent to school, or did you ever
see a brindled cow trying to get a discount from the bank?
Do rabbits go about to borrow money in great haste when
it's near three o'clock, or must poodle-dogs shy round the
corner when they see creditors coming?&mdash;No; it's left for
me and for you to be full all the time of botheration and
vexation, to keep life in our precious bodies. We don't lie
down in the grass, to nibble a bit of clover between sleeps&mdash;you
never saw me flutter up an apple-tree, to roost, with
my head poked under my wing, or sitting with the pigeons
atop of a chimbly, with no care on my mind only as to where
I should fly to next, for the sake of fun. A man must not
coil himself up on a cellar-door when the sun shines, or he'll
be tuck up right away, as a fellow with no visible signs of
living, when if rights was rights, all he should want as a
visible sign of living would be a pretty good-sized mouth
of his own, with a tolerable supply of teeth in it. Natur'
ought to finish all we want to bite; and what we should have
to do would be to have ourselves provided with something to
bite with; and I'm pretty well off' as to that. Give me the
eatables, and I'll be bound to find whatever else is needed to
make out my dinner. But, no&mdash;not at all&mdash;that's not the
way the world is carried on under the present system of
operations. Natur' doesn't care how great your appetite is.
She never minds if you're as hungry as a hawk. Sposin'
you were to do as the animals and the birds do&mdash;take what

<!-- page 166 -->

you want and gobble it right up, why then they open a big
book and say it's larceny&mdash;and so off you're sent to Miamensin
for a year or two, to learn better manners. Now did
you ever see a burglarious sheep in the Black Maria, or a
thieving chicken going along with a constable holding by the
cuff of its neck? I guess not&mdash;all these little comforts are
kept for the reasonable critters&mdash;nobody else has the enjoyment
but only men, and much good it does them. Be a man,
indeed!&mdash;that's the worst of it. I am a man already, and am
willing to swop places with almost anything that isn't a man.
I'd rather be a sunfish dodging about in the canal, to get clear
of the boys with their pin-hooks, than to be the president of
the United States, who always has trouble about him quite
as big as his salary."</p>

<p>Having thus unburthened his mind of the great idea that
it did groan withal, David Dumps set forth with the largest
of all possible cigars in his mouth, being firmly of the impression
that one's cigar should be proportioned to one's sorrow.
A little cigar is an amusement, while it requires a big
one to be a consolation. Where David passed the intervening
time, we do not know, but at a late hour in the night, he
was seen performing many curious antics in illustration of
the idea.</p>

<p>"I should like to be a calf," said he, and he bleated. "Oh,
if I'd only been born a sheep," added he, and he baa'd. And
thus the neighborhood was rendered vocal by all the sounds
of the agricultural interests. We are not sure indeed but that
he jumped upon a high step and crowed, and tones like that
of a turkey-gobbler resounded along the street. There was
no end to the eccentricities of David Dumps on that memorable
night; but being unable to reach home, from divers antagonistic
causes, he fell asleep in a corner, muttering that
he wished he could have feathers to save the tailor's bill,
could roost on a cherry-tree, to avoid the expenses of lodging,
and derive nourishment by an inhalation of the air, to
escape the cost of beef-steaks.</p>

<!-- page 167 -->

<p>"I want to be independent," sighed he, "and I'll sleep
here by way of a beginning."</p>

<p>Poor Dumps&mdash;his indifference caught him such a dreadful
cold, that he is disposed for the future to eschew all experiment
upon new methods of living, and if he can not do
exactly as the turkeys do, he will try to behave a little more
like other people, it being cheapest in the end.</p>

<div class="center" id="b2ch16">

<p>FLYNTEY HARTE:</p>

<p class="small">OR, THE HARDENING PROCESS.</p>

</div>

<p>"I'LL knock your head off!" accompanied by an effort,
partially at least, to carry the threat into execution, formed
the earliest outpouring of maternal tenderness that little
Flyntey Harte could bring to mind; and it made an impression,
both mental and physical, which time has been unable
to efface.</p>

<p>"I'll knock your head off!" exclaimed Mrs. Flyntey Harte&mdash;a
good-enough woman in her way, everybody said, but,
as the good-enough family often are, quite unused to self-restraint,
innocent altogether of the theory and practice of
self-government, and wofully addicted, when provoked or
vexed, to extravagances of speech and redundancies of action.
Such was particularly the case in the present instance. The
young Flyntey being affected with a crossness and a perversity
at a moment when the good lady aforesaid had no temper
for the endurance&mdash;these stages of condition always happen
out of time&mdash;the young Flyntey was, of course, forthwith
accommodated with a sonorous box o' the ear, intended
mainly to sooth his perturbed spirit, while it likewise served
all the purposes of an orrery to his as yet unenlightened understanding.
Flyntey saw quite as many stars, in galaxy or
in constellation, as ever became apparent to the astronomer;
but unfortunately for Mrs. Flyntey Harte, the remedial means
resorted to, rather tended to aggravate than to counteract the
disorder; and little Flyntey, who had given offence in the
first place by the expression of his uneasiness, having now

<!-- page 169 -->

an increase to his uneasiness, set himself to work at an increased
expression and with renewed offence. Consequently,
there was quite a "bawl" at Mrs. Flyntey Harte's, with
more of music in it than was agreeable or diverting, inducing
several other demonstrations, knockingly, at little
Flyntey's head, to allay the storm which had been caused by
knocks.</p>

<p>"Won't you hush?"&mdash;and as Flyntey gave no token of
acquiescence, but, on the contrary, expanded his mouth still
wider, he was "taken and shaken," to the variation, though
perhaps not to the improvement of his vocal strain.</p>

<p>The resources of genius, as regards the administration of
nursery affairs, appeared at last to be exhausted. Mrs. Flyntey
Harte sat down to rock herself, in all the energy of despair;
and little Flyntey Harte roared away as lustily as ever, over
the griefs, known and unknown, which disturbed his mental
tranquillity. But a new idea suddenly flashed into the maternal
mind, like one of those strategic inspirations which
often gain the day when the battle is seemingly lost.</p>

<p>"I'll give you something to cry for!" screamed the lady,
again taking up the controversy, on the assumption that like
cures like; and it must be confessed that she was fully equal
to her word. Little Flyntey was immediately furnished with
something to cry for, in addition to that which he had received
already, and being thus furnished, under a belief that by this
species of urging he would the sooner be induced to cry himself
out, he took ample occasion to demonstrate the soundness
and endurance of the lungs with which he was gifted,
and perversely afforded no prospect whatever of being cried
out in any reasonable space of time.</p>

<p>"That boy will be the death of me!" thundered paternity,
in the shape of Mr. Flyntey Harte, who had come ravening
homeward for his dinner, and whose acerbities were, therefore,
in a high state of activity. "My dear, why don't you
hush him up at once?" added he, giving force to the idea by
a "dumb motion," pantomimic of the spank.</p>

<!-- page 170 -->

<p>"He can't be hushed up, as you call it," replied Mrs.
Flyntey Harte. "I'm sure it's not my fault&mdash;no mother
pays more attention to her children than I do&mdash;I've been
slapping him, and shaking him, off and on, for the whole
blessed morning"&mdash;and she immediately offered a few samples
of both methods of operation&mdash;"but, in spite of all I
can do, he is bad as bad can be yet. I can't think, for my
part, what the brat would have."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" retorted old Mr. Flyntey Harte: "you women
never know how to manage a child&mdash;let me at him a minute!"
and Flyntey went at him with a zeal probably deserving of
better success; but little Flyntey Harte continued, notwithstanding
all the parental care lavished upon him, to roar and
to whine alternately until he fell fast asleep through weariness
and exhaustion.</p>

<p>Thus ended one day in the life of little Flyntey Harte, this
one day exposing with clearness the principle on which his
domestic education was conducted, and perhaps, likewise,
affording a glimpse of the results to which it led. His parents
had no other method of training intellect, and of forming
character, than that which may be described as the system
of terrorism; and, with the best intentions in the world,
to "terrorism" they resorted, upon all occasions of difficulty.
It seemed to simplify the problem so, and to condense, as it
were, all the perplexing theories of youthful cultivation into
a plain and practical doctrine, capable of being applied on the
instant, and under any circumstances whatever. There was
a saving, too, of time, and care, and thought, in coming to
the comfortable conclusion that the wisest way of bringing
little Flyntey up, was to knock little Flyntey down. It levelled
the difficulty at once, besides being so wholesome and
pleasant to the instructor, who, in this view of the subject, is
under no obligation to suppress wrath, or to restrain the
emotions of impatience. On the contrary, it seems to be a
permission to slap away, right and left, killing two birds with
one stone, by at once gratifying your own pugnacity, and

<!-- page 171 -->

giving your pupil an impulse forward in the walks of useful
knowledge. But it must be confessed, however, unfortunately
both for the theory here alluded to and for little Flyntey
Harte himself, that, while no boy ever had more "pains" bestowed
upon him in the processes of education, it is also true
that no boy ever yielded more "pains" in return&mdash;as if it
were on a principle of poetical justice that caused the sowing
and the reaping to be somewhat similar in kind. Flyntey
was "corrected" every day of his existence&mdash;sometimes
twice, if not thrice a day; and yet popular report set him
down proverbially as the worst lad in the neighborhood.
Was it not strange that such should be the discouraging result
of so much toil of arm and expenditure of strap, and
that the only advantage derived by either of the parties should
be merely deducible from the exercise?</p>

<p>Not an hour passed that it was not announced to little
Flyntey, formally or informally, that his wickedness was beyond
all other wickedness; and little Flyntey took it as
matter of course, that he was wicked, that he must be wicked,
and wicked he therefore was, to all intents and purposes;
no good being expected from him, which, we take it, in a
stout constitution, either for evil or its opposite, is as sure
a way as any, of making it certain that no good will
come.</p>

<p>"Might just as well enjoy myself," said little Flyntey;
"they don't expect any better from me."</p>

<p>It was astonishing to both father and mother that Flyntey
had no instinctive notions about <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>; and that
he should have come into the world so surprisingly ignorant
of the fundamental principles of the social compact, as to lay
his unhallowed hands on whatever he wanted; and we are
constrained to admit that a knowledge of the rights of property
was not spontaneous in his infant mind; so that, if he
desired to have a thing, it was most likely, if occasion served,
that he would take that very thing, putting it either into his
mouth or into his pocket, with no very serious visitations of

<!-- page 172 -->

remorse for having gone contrary to the statutes. We can
not well account for it, but there is no contending against
the fact, made apparent so frequently, that Flyntey's propensities,
appetites, and inclinations, were developed in advance
of his reasoning and restraining powers. Was he not a
wicked one, the little Flyntey, not to comprehend, as soon
as his eyes were open, that people on this earth are not to do
exactly as they like?&mdash;and what are we to expect from that
childhood, like Flyntey's, which could not at once anticipate
the wisdom gathered by years? Of course, there was but
one recipe for expediting his intellectual progress, and many
chastisements were invoked to ripen conscience, and to expand
causality.</p>

<p>"Let that alone, you Flyntey!</p>

<p>"And why must I let it alone?&mdash;I want that&mdash;I will have
that!"</p>

<p>"Because, if you don't let it alone, I'll whip you within an
inch of your life&mdash;I will, you thief!"</p>

<p>The reasoning, perhaps, may be regarded as sound&mdash;there
is no doubt whatever that the whipping to which it
pointed was, in general, sound enough&mdash;but yet little Flyntey
Harte could only understand from this admonition, not
so much that it was his duty and his best interest to resist
the impulses of his acquisitiveness, as that it was his policy
so to regulate them as to " 'scape whipping." He saw
nothing more than the arbitrary will of another and a
stronger, based upon barefaced power, arraying itself against
the cravings of his own individual will, and condescending
to no kindly explanations of its conduct; and little Flyntey,
unconvinced, called in the flexibilities of insincerity and
cunning, to enable him to creep round obstacles that he
could not directly surmount. The petty larceny, in consequence,
bloomed into one of his choicest accomplishments.
Nay, even when detection was inevitable, he weighed and
balanced the good with the evil. If the pleasure of attaining
his end seemed to transcend the torment of the penalty

<!-- page 173 -->

he enjoyed the one at the cost of the other, and looked upon
himself as a gainer by the bargain.</p>

<p>Another singular result soon manifested itself. Little
Flyntey Harte, though himself fresh, as it were, from the
sorrows of affliction, and from the griefs of infliction, proved
to be a tyrant and an oppressor&mdash;very cruel and very barbarous,
to all who were unable to defend themselves&mdash;he
proved a terror to the smaller children, and a horror to the
cats and dogs. He had, somehow or other&mdash;can you imagine
how?&mdash;gathered one generalization into his magazine
of maxims, that pain of a corporeal nature is the great actuating
impulse of the world, and that it should be employed
as a means of procuring amusement as freely as for any
other purpose whatever. "If you are not hurt yourself,"
thought Flyntey, "it's prime sport to hurt other people,"
and accordingly, none were safe from his machinations in
that respect; and direful were the complaints on this score
against little Flyntey Harte. But here again&mdash;what is to
be done in such a case?&mdash;the precepts of humanity, so industriously
flogged into him, answered no other end than that
of increasing the evil, by rendering it the more guarded, and
the more difficult to avoid. Even the mollifying influence
of ratan, cowskin, or horsewhip, were impotent in imparting
the lessons of kindness, charity, and love. They rather
aggravated the treacherousness of and malignity which they
were intended to eradicate.</p>

<p>There had been an endeavor, likewise, according to the
canons of flagellation, to place young Flyntey Harte <i>en
rapport</i> with veracity, that he might, in the way of forming
a creditable acquaintance, sometimes have to do with the
truth. But, by his own sinister mode of reasoning, our hero
came to peculiar conclusions:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Flyntey, did you take that sugar, or smoke them cigars?"
inquired his father, as he gave significant pliancy to a rod;
"come&mdash;tell the truth now."</p>

<p>"If I do tell the truth," mused Flyntey, eying the rod

<!-- page 174 -->

askance, and estimating from long experience, its capacity
for mischief, "if I do tell the truth, there is no mistake
about it&mdash;I shall be whaled, sartin&mdash;but if I don't tell the
truth, may be I'll get off clear&mdash;them's the chances; and I
go for the chances."</p>

<p>"No, sir; it wasn't me," replied Flyntey, with an iron
countenance, and with that steady front of denial which
practice in deceit is sure to give; and it depended upon the
chances aforesaid whether he should be chastised or not;
but if, unluckily, the evidences of the deed, or the accidental
exasperations of paternal temper were against him, Flyntey
Harte would be corrected <i>in extenso</i>. In that event the result
was still the same as before hinted at.</p>

<p>"I'll teach you to steal sugar!" and the lesson did teach
him, not so much that the felonious appropriation of forbidden
sweets was improper and unjustifiable, but that it
should be done, Spartanlike, in a way to preclude the possibility
of being discovered. The deficiency was made up
in sand.</p>

<p>"I'll teach you to tell falsehoods!" and the teaching&mdash;which
played lively enough about the back, but came not
near the heart&mdash;did induce the patient to exercise more
ingenuity in the getting up of denials, subterfuges, and evasions,
than had been his preceding practice.</p>

<p>"They talk to me a good deal about the truth," soliloquized
Flyntey, "and they say truth is a pretty nice sort of
thing; but I don't believe a word of it. Own up, must I,
whenever I've had a bit of fun to myself? I sha'n't!&mdash;Owning
up is always a pair of boxed ears&mdash;I don't like
that&mdash;and as for the truth, why that is a thunderin' big
hiding, every time. They ask me for the truth; and when
I tell it, they always switch me; and if I don't tell the truth,
then they switch me to make me tell it; and after I have
told it, they switch me again, because I told it. Whenever
I hear of the truth, it's as sure as can be, that switching is
not far off. They always go together; and I'll do my best

<!-- page 175 -->

to keep out of such disagreeable company. If they want to
know who it was that broke the closet window, and took
the preserves, let 'em find it out by their learning. It's just
as easy to say no, as it is to say yes; and it's cheaper, considerable.
And now I'll go and enjoy myself. Catch me
telling the truth, to get a flogging."</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fun! yes&mdash;there's going to be fun this afternoon,"
muttered little Flyntey Harte, as he skulked about a house
at the corner, now loitering at the pump, and anon gazing
idly into the shop-windows, giving, from time to time, a
short peculiar whistle, as a subdued signal to some desired
companion. It could scarcely be said that Flyntey's countenance
wore a smile&mdash;the hardening process and its deceitful
consequences had long ago swept smiles for ever
from his face, and had left instead, a joyless contortion of
feature that had nothing of mirthfulness about it, even when
the cordage of his physiognomy pulled hard to open gates
for laughter. Flyntey had no laughter in him&mdash;there was
none of the joyousness of youth about his hard and careworn
look, with its premature expression of depravity; and
when he would be merry, it was awkward, ungainly, and
unpractised, dashed too, with a tinge of malice and revenge,
as if it were but an ambush for the stealthy approach of
trick and enmity. But in the instance now referred to, it
was evident that Flyntey had a thought within, which was
pleasant to himself at least&mdash;whatever it might prove to
others.</p>

<p>"Fun for two!" again ejaculated he, with a gleam of
stony delight; and there was a cold sparkle in his eye.
coupled with a compression of the lip that spoke of mischief.</p>

<p>"Fun!" said he?&mdash;Fun needs to be defined. Many
things are honored with the name of fun, which are eventually
discovered to be anything but fun. The funny man is

<!-- page 176 -->

too often a sad fellow; and the frog is in the right of it,
who decided that fun to me might be death to him. When
such folks as Flyntey Harte thus rub their hands together,
anticipating glee, the fun in contemplation is to be a monopoly,
leaving one of the parties to the affair as far from
realizing the fun as can well be imagined. Ringing people's
bells, considered in juvenility, is fun in some sort,
as you thought once, and ran in joy away; but it is a
shrewd question with the philosopher, whether rheumatic
and wearied Sally, after a hard day's work, is alive to a full
appreciation of the fun which calls her, by tintinnabulation
and these eccentric campanologian performances, from the
deep recess of kitchen, or from sweet repose in garrets,
to find none but nobody at street-doors. Do you not&mdash;most
funny one&mdash;now hear her growling in retreat? Yes, Sally
grumbles, ay, and Juba, too, to be disturbed in this, your
funny fashion. The whole department of hoaxing and of
practical jokery is of the same description of one-sided fun;
and though it be set down as fun to throw eggs into a crowd,
still, it is not often that the recipient thereof is overwhelmed
with gratitude at the favor so liberally bestowed. A snowball
in one's bed, or freezing water in a boot, often convulses
the performer of the deed with deepest bursts of
laughter; yet it will be observed as a general rule, that the
effect upon the person for whom all this trouble has been
taken, is for the most part, and in the majority of instances,
widely different; as indeed will also show itself to be the
case when a trap is left upon the stairs, to cause the unwary
to go through a certain series of ground and lofty tumbling,
for the amusement of those who are in the secret and who
listen for the clatter. Thus, too, when the chair upon which
you purpose to deposite yourself, is suddenly withdrawn,
and your descent is considerably greater and more rapid than
you had reason to anticipate, it is within the scope of likelihood
that your usually placid brow will be corrugated with
frowns, and that the few words you do speak in answer to

<!-- page 177 -->

the mirth of bystanders, will embody more of the force than
of the graces of our language.</p>

<p>Flyntey's look, therefore, indicated some species of fun of
this restricted nature&mdash;the sport to be all here&mdash;the annoyance
and the suffering all there; and he now awaited the
approach of an accomplice&mdash;one Badde Feller, who, without
the intensity of character and the powers of invention,
that so eminently distinguished Flyntey Harte, and made
him instinctively a leader, had yet the faculty of following
in another's trail, and of admiring the imprint of a broader
footstep than his own.</p>

<p>"Fun!&mdash;where?" inquired Badde Feller, with his usual
sneaking smirk, being then in process of an errand, with a
bottle in one hand, and a shilling in the other.</p>

<p>"Here!" growled Flyntey, tapping upon the breast of his
jacket, with an air of lofty superiority. "Peep in there, and
tell me what you think of that?"</p>

<p>"Why, if it isn't a pistil&mdash;an 'orse pistil! Is it borrered?"</p>

<p>"Hooked, you goose," replied Flyntey, with a smile;
"hooked round at Jones's&mdash;leave me alone for that&mdash;baby
was at the door, and I tumbled it off the steps, for fun; but
then, thinks I to myself, thinks I, now's the time; so I picked
baby Jones up in my arms, gave baby Jones a pinch or two,
to make it squeal the louder, and carried it into the shop,
poor little Jones!&mdash;the folks all came running to see what
was the matter&mdash;gave me two cents for being a good boy,
and, as I came out, I hooked the pistol! ho! ho!"</p>

<p>"And shot off too, I guess, ha! ha!" jocularly and delightedly
added Badde Feller; "it takes you, Flyntey, to
do good things&mdash;I'd never thought of that 'are&mdash;never."</p>

<p>"I guess not&mdash;but now we've got the pistol, what else is
to be done!"</p>

<p>"Shoot something, mustn't we?" added Badde Feller, with
an innocent smile. "Kill somebody's dog, won't we?"</p>

<p>"Ay; but where's the powder, and the shot, and the
bullets? Get them, and we'll shoot Jones's pet cat to begin

<!-- page 178 -->

with. Stop&mdash;I have it&mdash;keep that bottle and sell it&mdash;give
me the shilling to get the powder, and afterward you can
tell your old man that you fell down, and spilt the whiskey&mdash;that's
the plan. You'd never have thought of that, neither&mdash;it
takes me."</p>

<p>Badde Feller demurred, lacking nerve for the crisis; but at
length his fears were overcome: and it will be seen in the engraving
how the plans against Jones's cat were pushed from
abstract theory into the full flush of glorious practice. Jones's
cat perished, yielding up at least one of its nine lives; but the
murder had a witness in the dowager Mrs. Jones. It was
"my grandmother's cat," and thereby hangs a tale, though
that the cat be dead by the remorseless hands of Flyntey
Harte.</p>

<p>This affair proved to be catastrophical, as well, or as ill,
to Flyntey Harte, as to Jones's unhappy cat. Investigation
was instituted&mdash;the evidence being direct, not circumstantial,
left not a hinge or loop to hang a doubt on&mdash;the larceny of
the pistol&mdash;the death of the pussy&mdash;and the deluding of
Badde Feller, who played innocence on the occasion, and
"owned up" as state's evidence, under the plea of having
been cajoled into disappointing his father in regard to the
bottle and the shilling&mdash;relative to which, however, we do
not believe one word&mdash;all formed a terrific array of criminal
fact against young Flyntey Harte; and as, unfortunately for
himself, it had not been his luck to have killed a man, and to
be tried by a jury, which would have secured the verdict of
acquittal, a conviction and a punishment came inexorably
down upon him, after the manner to which he had been long
accustomed. Flyntey Harte, the elder, with a nerve worthy
of the first Brutus, made a last effort to scourge his precious
offspring into that wholesome appreciation of the beauties
of honesty, humanity, and truthfulness, which as yet seemed
to be a sealed book to his perverted eyes. The result, however,
was as "striking" as the means employed; for young
Flyntey Harte beat a retreat in the middle of the night, after

<!-- page 179 -->

breaking whatever was breakable, silently, about the house.
His own clothes went with him, added to other choice selections
in the way of apparel; and he took as much of the
paternal cash as became available in the opening of desks
and drawers. Nay, he had even made well-intended arrangements
for a domiciliary conflagration, which failed
through mischance; and the words&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"GON TO SEE,"</p>

<p>were scrawled in charcoal upon the wall of his chamber, in
such equivocal orthography, that none could tell whether he
had embarked his fortunes on the ocean wave, or had merely
set forth "to see" the world, in a more earthly way. But whatever
be the way chosen by young Flyntey Harte&mdash;on the
waters or on the dry land&mdash;is a way which will lead to
prisons, if not to that greater elevation whence it is usual to
"drop the subject;" and if so, it is left to consideration
where the blame and responsibility should rest, for all Flynty
Harte's mischances and misdeeds. The theme, perhaps,
may be found worthy of a moment's thought, in its connexion
with the varied systems of youthful training with which our
age abounds.</p>

<p class="small">THE MERRY CHRISTMAS AND THE HAPPY NEW YEAR</p>

<p class="small">OF</p>

<p>MR. DUNN BROWN.</p>

</div>

<p>POOR Mr. Dunn Brown!</p>

<p>Do you not, friend, pity any one who thus bears engraved
upon his front the unerring signs of a sad and discontented
spirit&mdash;you, we mean, all of you, who are gifted&mdash;if, as this
world goes, it be a gift to feel acutely those sorrows which
appertain rather to our neighbors than ourselves&mdash;who are
afflicted, then, if you prefer it so, with philanthropy and tenderness
of heart? Are you not disposed, when in the mood,
and with time to spare for the purpose, to weep over the unknown
sufferings of the rueful Mr. Dunn Brown, and to enter
largely on the work of sympathization and of condolement,
shaking him gently by the hand, with a tear or two in your
eye, as you advise him to be of good cheer, and to "get up
and try it again?" We are sure it must be so.</p>

<p>Yet we fear that all of this disinterested kindness of yours
is a waste and a throwing away of benevolence. Mr. Dunn
Brown is not to be comforted&mdash;Mr. Dunn Brown does not
wish to be comforted&mdash;Mr. Dunn Brown regards himself as
happier to be unhappy than all the rest of the world as it
revels in felicity and runs riot in delight. Laugh who will&mdash;sing
who may&mdash;dance whoever has the agility&mdash;Dunn
Brown has more of pleasure, according to his ideas of pleasure,
in these doleful groanings of his than is to be conceived
of by any of the inferior nature. For, as he thinks, they,
poor creatures, "don't know any better." But he&mdash;Mr.
Dunn Brown&mdash;will not enjoy delight upon such terms as

<!-- page 181 -->

these&mdash;he knows a great deal better&mdash;ask him, and he will
tell you so&mdash;and therefore, on a principle, makes the worst
of things, and exults sulkily in his superior wisdom, with a
smile of scornfulness and contempt for those triflers in the
sunbeam who are so weak as to be content and merry.
Dunn Brown is not to be caught in the perpetration of such
a silliness, but growls, he does, and grumbles, in all the exasperation
of a splenetic spirit&mdash;the great, the wise, the
profound Mr. Dunn Brown&mdash;who is there, anywhere, but
Mr. Dunn Brown? Who is there that has been, can be, or
will be, to compare with Mr. Dunn Brown?</p>

<p>True, Mr. Dunn Brown, with his keen perception of values,
wishes misanthropically, both night and morning, that
he never had been born, regarding it as the greatest misfortune
that ever happened to him, to have made an appearance
on this sublunary sphere of trouble and disquietude; but, for
all that, Mr. Dunn Brown is as firm as can be in the faith
that it would have been a disaster to the world itself, if the
age we live in had not been enlightened by his example, and
by the comments on it which were only to be imagined and
uttered by a man like him&mdash;if, indeed, there could by possibility
have been another man like him cotemporaneous with
Mr. Dunn Brown&mdash;who firmly believes that, however it may
be with others, he stands alone, without a parallel&mdash;only one
Dunn Brown&mdash;the rest are verdant in their tinge and coloring.
He&mdash;he only&mdash;is not to be deceived by the toys
and sugar-plums of existence, into a belief that there is anything
worth living for&mdash;he sees, he knows, he comprehends;
and he scorns the superficial gilding which makes others
happy in their tinselled gingerbread.</p>

<p>When Dunn Brown rises in the morning, he rails at the
day which calls him to another succession of plagues and
perplexities, in causing ends to meet, and in providing for
the demands of business. When Mr. Dunn Brown goes to
bed at night, Mr. Dunn Brown is at least half inclined to the
opinion, that if it were not for the loss that would thus be

<!-- page 182 -->

sustained by society, it would be an economy if he were
never to wake again&mdash;a saving in the way of tears and a retrenchment
in the matter of misanthropic reflection. You
should see Mr. Dunn Brown as he makes his forlorn appearance
at the breakfast-table, and imbibes his nutriment&mdash;how
he carps, how he complains, how he argues against the
soundness of every proposition that may be broached; objecting
to the coffee, impugning the cakes, and placing the
seal of his reprobation on the savory sausage; croaking and
eating until the argument and the appetite are both exhausted,
and his hunger and his querulousness are satisfied and
silenced. Do see Mr. Dunn Brown at his breakfast, in preference
to a visit to the menagerie. Should the process be
converted into an exhibition, it would be cheap at twenty-five
cents, only to acquire a knowledge of the ferocious capabilities
of Mr. Dunn Brown.</p>

<p>"And now, a merry Christmas to you, Mr. Dunn Brown."</p>

<p>"Merry stuff&mdash;merry nonsense&mdash;merry fiddlesticks!" responds
Mr. Dunn Brown&mdash;"pretty merriment, indeed, to
be compelled to empty your pockets, whether you want to
or not, to give things to people who don't care a button about
you, after they have obtained what they want, with their
merry Christmas, and all that&mdash;and that's not the worst of
it either, for you must bother your brains for a week, thinking
what you shall give them, and then not hit upon the right
thing after all&mdash;all sorts of things, too, that are useless&mdash;fine
books to those who never read, with precious curiosities
that only serve to lumber up all the dark closets. Now, I'll
leave it to any man, any woman&mdash;yes, and any child, I will,
whether it is not the first requisite of a Christmas-box, that
it should not be available for any purpose&mdash;too fine to touch&mdash;too
frail to be employed. The whole house is cluttered
up with Christmas-boxes; and all the children are either
crying over their broken toys, or are very sick with surfeits
of pie and candy. D'ye call that merry Christmas, I'd like
to know?</p>

<!-- page 183 -->

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;'merry Christmas,' to be sure&mdash;and what
does that mean? Yes&mdash;what does that mean when you take
your dictionary and translate it into plain language? Why,
a half-dollar at least, if it does not come to a great deal more
than fifty cents. You want to be merry at my expense, do
you, Mr. Merry Christmas?&mdash;Well, when I'm sent to the
legislature, I'll have a law passed against all such merriments,
I will. Every man shall shake his own hand, and
everybody buy his own Christmas-box&mdash;that's my notion,
and that's the way I'd box 'em, all round, and see who'd be
merry then."</p>

<p>"A happy New-Year, Mr. Dunn Brown&mdash;I wish you a
very happy New-Year."</p>

<p>"A happy New-Year!" cries Mr. Dunn Brown; "I wish
you would tell me where I'm to find the happiness of the
New-Year, when all the world comes pecking at me with
their bills, as if a man had nothing else to do but to pay
money&mdash;everything going out and not a farthing coming in&mdash;tailors'
boys, bootmakers' boys&mdash;all sorts of boys, bill in
one hand and t'other hand extended for the cash, pulling at the
bell, too, as if it was the greatest sport in the world to prevent
a man from having one moment of peace and happiness.
And this is your New-Year&mdash;your happy New-Year! The
old year was bad enough; but each of your New-Years is a
great deal worse than any that went before. I can say for
one, that I never want to see a New-Year again as long as
I live; for no sooner is the old year fixed off comfortably,
than in comes another to disturb the whole arrangement."</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that Mr. Dunn Brown is ever to be
found in that melancholy measure which is familiarly known
to the rest of the world as "a peck of troubles;" and that
whatever may chance to occur, it is certain to give rise to a
discourse somewhat of the funereal order. To all anniversaries
he has an especial aversion, and nothing moves his wrath
more effectively than to speak of the celebration of a birthday&mdash;his
own, or that of any other person.</p>

<!-- page 184 -->

<p>"Your birthday, Mr. Dunn Brown&mdash;is it not? How old,
Mr. Dunn Brown?"</p>

<p>"How old?"&mdash;why not, O world!&mdash;why not, in this
matter, change and transmute your phraseology? How old!&mdash;is
it agreeable thus to be reminded of the course of time
and of the progress of decay, by your "how old?" Would
it not be as easy to say, "How young are you now," instead
of thus continually reminding people that their span on earth
is marching rapidly to its close?</p>

<p>"And here it is again!" exclaims Mr. Dunn Brown.
"Why could not our lives have been begun at the other
end, so that we might be growing younger every day, instead
of dwindling into wrinkles and gray hairs?&mdash;then they would
say 'fifty years young,' instead of 'fifty years old,' which
would be vastly more agreeable&mdash;'getting young fast'&mdash;wouldn't
that be nice? But to rejoice over birthdays, the
way they have them now, it's the silliest thing I ever heard
of. Nobody sees me making a fuss about my birthday, any
more than I do about your merry Christmas and your happy
New-Year, No&mdash;I keep just as quiet about it as ever I
can&mdash;sort'er dodge round it, and try to make myself forget
that there ever was such a thing as a birthday, instead of
ciphering over it as some people do, as if there were a
pleasure in counting how much is gone and how little remains."</p>

<p>It will, therefore, be perceived that Mr. Dunn Brown is a
species of philosopher&mdash;sad and sombre&mdash;as we find it usually
the case with your incipient philosopher, who, in the first
stages of his advancement, cries aloud that all is barren. But
Dunn Brown advances no further than grumbletonianism;
and we fear that there he will remain, Dunn Brown, convinced
that man, legitimately, is never properly employed
unless he is engaged in the useful operation of shedding tears
of vain regret and finding fault with that which is to be regarded
as the irremediable, not knowing that there is something
beyond this which enables humanity to make the best

<!-- page 185 -->

of its position and to be happy with the circumstances which
surround it.</p>

<p>But still, Dunn Brown has that negative happiness which
consists in pluming himself upon his superior sagacity in the
pleasant labor of the discovering of miseries and the preparation
of torments, while he likewise gathers comfort in the
habit of despising those who are foolish enough not to engage
in the cultivation of sorrow, which with Dunn Brown may be
regarded as a species of wholesale manufacture.</p>

<p>"Any man"&mdash;it is Dunn Brown's decided conviction,
which he carries out practically&mdash;"any man&mdash;a live man,
who is not decidedly miserable all the time he is alive, must
be a goose&mdash;there's no alternative. I'm thankful I'm not a
goose, but a sensible, thinking individual, and, of course, just
about as miserable a man as you could wish to see, especially
about the New-Year, when the silly ones keep up such a
firing of guns, as if they could drive off the charges of creditors
by the discharges of blank-cartridge&mdash;a thing not to be
did. But I do wish that a man could somehow or other contrive
to run away from himself as easily as he can run away
from other people. If anybody will find out how to do that,
he shall be remembered in my will, if there happens to be
anything over, which, from present appearances, isn't very
likely."</p>

<p>And so Mr. Dunn Brown sits down in his "old armchair,"
to rail at the world and to congratulate himself upon his own
wretchedness, until he is shrivelled away to a mere anatomy,
unhappy Dunn and melancholy Brown! One of his children
is to be educated as a sexton, while the other is to walk
abroad in the shadowy guise of an undertaker, as Dunn
Brown himself saunters through creation as its mourner-in-chief,
by constitution and by preference. Should he be smitten
by the love of military renown, the regiment he belongs
to must parade and muster as "the Blues"&mdash;no other color
will serve&mdash;no other color can prevail where he is present;
and should too much of mirthfulness pervade your vicinity,

<!-- page 186 -->

ask Mr. Dunn Brown to step in now and then, and our life
on it, there will soon be a sufficient infusion of gall and bitterness,
of misanthropy and discontent, to qualify the whole
matter to suit the most lugubrious fancy. Dunn Brown is a
perpetual <i>memento mori</i>&mdash;an everlasting remembrancer of
the insecurity of all human happiness; and we'd like to see
any of you venture upon a laugh or try the experiment of a
joke in his awful presence. Next to the obituary notices in
the journals, one of Dunn Brown's greatest enjoyments in
life is in the perusal of the bulletin-boards of the newspaper-offices,
when they recount the latest steamboat disaster, or
the most recent catastrophe upon a railroad. Depend upon
it, that he will meet you on the wharf, or greet you at the
depot, with all the most comfortable particulars of the peril
you are about to encounter. In this respect, Dunn Brown is
careful that you should have none of that species of bliss
which is the offspring of ignorance; and should you thus
serve to furnish an item of "appalling intelligence," you will
be pleased to remember, as the boiler bursts, that you would
rush upon your fate in defiance of the friendly cautions of
your careful friend, the immortal Dunn Brown, who knew
well how it would be, and who did not hesitate to tell you so.
Perhaps the thought may prove a source of comfort in your
sufferings. At all events, 'twas not the fault of Mr. Dunn
Brown. Was it, now?</p>

<p>PELEG W. PONDER:</p>

<p class="small">OR, THE POLITICIAN WITHOUT A SIDE.</p>

</div>

<p>IT is a curious thing&mdash;an unpleasant thing&mdash;a very embarrassing
sort of thing&mdash;but the truth must be told&mdash;if not
at all times, at least sometimes; and truth now compels the
declaration, that Peleg W. Ponder, whose character is
here portrayed, let him travel in any way, can not arrive
at a conclusion. He never had one of his own. He scarcely
knows a conclusion, even if he should chance to see one belonging
to other people. And, as for reaching a result, he
would never be able to do it, if he could stretch like a giraffe.
Results are beyond his compass. And his misfortune is,
perhaps, hereditary, his mother's name having been Mrs.
Perplexity Ponder, whose earthly career came to an end
while she was in dubitation as to which of the various physicians
of the place should be called in. If there had been
only one doctor in the town, Perplexity Ponder might have
been saved. But there were many&mdash;and what could Perplexity
do in such a case?</p>

<p>Ponder's father was run over by a wagon, as he stood debating
with himself, in the middle of the road, whether he
should escape forward or retreat backward. There were
two methods of extrication, and between them both old Ponder
became a victim. How then could their worthy son,
Peleg, be expected to arrive at a conclusion? He never
does.</p>

<!-- page 188 -->

<p>Yet, for one's general comfort and particular happiness,
there does not appear to be any faculty more desirable than
the power of "making up the mind." Right or wrong, it
saves a deal of wear and tear; and it prevents an infinite
variety of trouble. Commend us to the individual who closes
upon propositions like a nutcracker&mdash;whose promptness of
will has a sledge-hammer way with it, and hits nails continually
on the head. Genius may be brilliant&mdash;talent commanding;
but what is genius, or what is talent, if it lack that
which we may call the clinching faculty&mdash;if it hesitates,
veers, and flutters&mdash;suffers opportunity to pass, and stumbles
at occasion? To reason well is much, no doubt; but reason
loses the race, if it sits in meditation on the fence when competition
rushes by.</p>

<p>Under the best of circumstances, something must be left
to hazard. There is a chance in all things. No man can so
calculate odds in the affairs of life as to insure a certainty.
The screws and linchpins necessary to our purpose have not
the inflexibility of a fate; yet they must be trusted at some
degree of risk. Our candle may be put out by a puff of wind
on the stairs, let it be sheltered ever so carefully. Betsy is
a good cook, yet beefsteaks have been productive of strangulation.
Does it then follow from this, that we are never to
go to bed, except in the dark, and to abstain from breaking
our fast until dinner is announced?</p>

<p>One may pause and reflect too much. There must be action,
conclusion, result, or we are a failure, to all intents and
purposes&mdash;a self-confessed failure&mdash;defunct from the beginning.
And such was the case with Peleg W. Ponder, who
never arrived at a conclusion, or contrived to reach a result.
Peleg is always "stumped"&mdash;he "don't know what to think"&mdash;he
"can't tell what to say"&mdash;an unfinished gentleman,
with a mind like a dusty garret, full, as it were, of rickety
furniture, yet nothing serviceable&mdash;broken-backed chairs&mdash;three-legged
tables&mdash;pitchers without a handle&mdash;cracked
decanters and fractured looking-glasses&mdash;that museum of

<!-- page 189 -->

mutilations, in which housewifery rejoices, under the vague,
but never-realized hope, that these things may eventually
"come in play." Peleg's opinions lie about the workshop
of his brain, in every stage of progress but the last&mdash;chips,
sticks, and sawdust, enough, but no article ready to send
home.</p>

<p>Should you meet Peleg in the street, with "Good morning,
Peleg&mdash;how do you find yourself to-day?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I don't know exactly&mdash;I'm pretty&mdash;no, not very&mdash;pray,
how do you do, yourself?"</p>

<p>Now, if a man does not know exactly, or nearly, how he
is, after being up for several hours, and having had abundant
time to investigate the circumstances of his case, it is useless
to propound questions of opinion to such an individual. It
is useless to attempt it with Peleg. "How do you do," puzzles
him&mdash;he is fearful of being too rash, and of making a
reply which might not be fully justified by after-reflection.
His head may be about to ache, and he has other suspicious
feelings.</p>

<p>"People are always asking me how I do, and more than
half the time I can't tell&mdash;there's a good many different sorts
of ways of feeling betwixt and between 'Very sick, I thank
you,' and 'Half dead, I'm obliged to you;' and people won't
stop to hear you explain the matter. They want to know
right smack, when you don't know right smack yourself.
Sometimes you feel things a-coming, and just after, you feel
things a-going. And nobody's exactly prime all the while.
I ain't, anyhow&mdash;I'm kinder so just now, and I'm sorter
t'other way just after.&mdash;Then, some people tell you that
you look very well, when you don't feel very well&mdash;how
then?"</p>

<p>At table, Peleg is not exactly sure what he will take; and
sits looking slowly up and down the board, deliberating what
he would like, until the rest of the company have finished
their repast, there being often nothing left which suits Peleg's
hesitating appetite.</p>

<!-- page 190 -->

<p>Peleg has never married&mdash;not that he is averse to the
connubial state&mdash;on the contrary, he has a large share of the
susceptibilities, and is always partially in love. But female
beauty is so various. At one time, Peleg is inclined to believe
that perfection lies in queenly dignity&mdash;the majesty of
an empress fills his dreams; and he looks down with disdain
upon little people. He calls them "squabs," in derogation.
But anon, in a more domestic mood, he thinks of fireside
happiness and quiet bliss, declining from the epic poetry of
loveliness, to the household wife, who might be disposed to
bring him his slippers, and to darn the hole in his elbow.
When in the tragic vein, he fancies a brunette; and when
the sunshine is on his soul, blue eyes are at a premium.
Should woman possess the lightness of a sylph, or should
her charms be of the more solid architecture? Ought her
countenance to beam in smiles, or will habitual pensiveness
be the more interesting? Is sparkling brilliancy to be preferred
to gentle sweetness?</p>

<p>"If there wasn't so many of them, I shouldn't be so
bothered," said Peleg; "or, if they all looked alike, a man
couldn't help himself. But yesterday, I wanted this one&mdash;to-day,
I want that one; and to-morrow, I'll want t'other
one; and how can I tell, if I should get this, or that, or
t'other, that it wouldn't soon be somebody else that I really
wanted? That's the difficulty. It always happens so with
me. When the lady's most courted, and thinks I ought to
speak out, then I begin to be skeered, for fear I've made a
mistake, and have been thinking I loved her, when I didn't.
May be it's not the right one&mdash;may be she won't suit&mdash;may
be I might do better&mdash;may be I had better not venture at
all. I wish there wasn't so many 'may-bes' about everything,
especially in such affairs. I've got at least a dozen
unfinished courtships on hand already."</p>

<p>But all this happened a long time ago; and Peleg has
gradually lost sight of his fancy for making an addition to
his household. Not that he has concluded, even yet, to

<!-- page 191 -->

remain a bachelor. He would be alarmed at the bare mention
of such an idea. He could not consent to be shelved in
that decisive manner. But he has subsided from active
"looking around" in pursuit of his object, into that calm
irresponsible submissiveness, characteristic of the somewhat
elderly bachelor, which waits until she may chance to present
herself spontaneously, and "come along" of her own
accord. "Some day&mdash;some day," says Peleg; "it will
happen some day or other. What's the use of being in a
hurry?"</p>

<p>Peleg W. Ponder's great object is now ambition. His
personal affairs are somewhat embarrassed by his lack of
enterprise; and he hankers greatly for an office. But which
side to join? Ay, there's the rub! Who will purvey the
loaf and fish? For whom shall Peleg shout?</p>

<p>Behold him, as he puzzles over the returns of the state
elections, laboring in vain to satisfy his mind as to the result
in the presidential contest. Stupefied by figures&mdash;perplexed
by contradictory statements&mdash;bothered by the general hurrah;
what can Peleg do?</p>

<p>"Who's going to win? That's all I want to know," exclaims
the vexed Peleg; "I don't want to waste my time a
blowing out for the wrong person, and never get a thank'e.
What's the use of that? There's Simpkins&mdash;says I, Simpkins,
says I, which is the party that can't be beat. And
Simpkins turns up his nose and tells me every fool knows
that&mdash;it's his side&mdash;so I hurrah for Simpkins's side as hard
as I can. But then comes Timpkins&mdash;Timpkins's side is
t'other side from Simpkins's side, and Timpkins offers to
bet me three levies that his side is the side that can't be
beat. Hurrah! says I, for Timpkins's side!&mdash;and then I
can't tell which side.</p>

<p>"As for the newspapers, that's worse still. They not
only crow all round, but they cipher it out so clear, that both
sides must win, if there's any truth in the ciphering-book;
which there isn't about election times. What's to be done?

<!-- page 192 -->

I've tried going to all the meetings&mdash;I've hurraed for everybody&mdash;I've
been in all the processions, and I sit a little
while every evening in all sorts of headquarters. I've got
one kind of documents in one pocket, and t'other kind of
documents in t'other pocket; and as I go home at night, I
sing one sort of song as loud as I can bawl half of the way,
and try another sort of song the rest of the way, just to split
the difference and show my impartiality. If I only had two
votes&mdash;a couple of 'em&mdash;how nice it would be.</p>

<p>"But the best thing that can be done now, I guess, as my
character is established both ways, is to turn in quietly till
the row is all over. Nobody will miss me when they are
so busy; and afterward, when we know all about it, just
look for Peleg W. Ponder as he comes down the street,
shaking people by the hand, and saying how we have used
them up. I can't say so now, or I would&mdash;for I am not
perfectly sure yet which is 'we,' or which is 'them.' Time
enough when the election is over."</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that Ponder is a remarkable person.
Peter Schlemihl lost his shadow, and became memorably
unhappy in consequence; but what was his misfortune
when compared with that of the man who has no side?
What are shadows if weighed against sides? And Peleg
is almost afraid that he never will be able to get a side, so
unlucky has he been heretofore. He begins to dread that
both sides may be defeated; and then, let us ask, what is to
become of him? Must he stand aside?</p>

<p>PETER PLODDY'S DREAM.</p>

</div>

<p>LET no one be unjust to Ploddy&mdash;to Peter Ploddy,
once "young man" to Mr. Figgs, the grocer, and now
junior partner of the flourishing firm of Figgs and
Ploddy. Though addicted a little to complaint, and apt
to institute comparisons unfavourable to himself, it would
be a harsh judgment to set him down as ever having
been envious, in the worst sense of the word. It is true,
no doubt, that at the period of his life concerning which
we are now called upon to speak, a certain degree of
discontent with his own position occasionally embittered
his reflections; but he had no wish to deprive others of
the advantage they possessed, nor did he hate them on
the score of their supposed superiority. It was not his
inclination to drag men down, let them be situated as
loftily as they might; and whatever of vexation or perplexity
he experienced in contemplating their elevation, arose
altogether from the fact that he could not clearly understand
why he should not be up there too. It was not
productive of pleasurable sensations to Ploddy, to see
folks splashed who were more elegantly attired than himself.
He never laughed from a window over the disastrous
results of a sudden shower; nor could he find it in
his heart to hope it would rain when his neighbours set
gayly forth on a rural excursion. It is a question, indeed,
whether it had been a source of satisfaction to him to see
any one's name on a list of bankrupts. The sheriff's advertisements
of property "seized and taken in execution,"
were never conned over with delight by Peter Ploddy;

<!-- page 6 -->

and when the entertainments given in his section of the
town were as splendid as luxury and profusion could
make them, it was yet possible for Peter to turn in his bed
at the sound of the music and of the merriment, without
a snarl about "there you go," and without a hint that
there are headaches in store for the gentlemen, with a
sufficient variety of coughs and colds for the ladies. He
never said, because an invitation had not been addressed
to Ploddy, that affairs of this sort make work for the
doctors.</p>

<p>It will be observed then, that Peter was not of a cynical
turn. Neither did he attempt to delude himself, as
many do, into a belief that he despised the things which
were denied to him. When his hands found an amplitude
of room in empty pockets, he was candid to himself,
and wished them better filled, instead of vainly endeavouring
to exalt poverty above riches. When Thompson
married wealth, or Johnson espoused beauty, it was
no part of Peter's philosophy to think that extravagant
habits might neutralize the one, and that the love of admiration
could render the other rather a torment than a
blessing. In short, Peter would have been pleased if
both together had fallen to his share. Wealth and beauty
might unite in Mrs. Peter Ploddy without causing consternation
in his mind, and he confessed that the said
Thompson and Johnson were lucky fellows.</p>

<p>It being conceded that pedestrianism is a healthy exercise,
and that being jumbled in an omnibus is a salutary
impulse to the physical constitution, still Peter remained
unshaken in the opinion, somewhat theoretical though it
were, that a fine horse is not to be taken amiss, and that
a smooth rolling carriage, however conducive to indolence
it may be, is not an appendage to be altogether
contemned. It is true, to be sure, that horses are often
perilous to a rider's limbs, and it needs no demonstration

<!-- page 7 -->

at this late day to show that vehicular mischances are
many; but Peter was willing to encounter the risk, and
to exchange the toilsome security of going on foot for the
dangers incident to more elevated conveyance. Haughtily
as they might travel by, he never even indulged himself
in a charitable hope that certain people might break
their necks before they reached home, notwithstanding
the quantity of dust thrown in his eyes. On such occasions,
it was the habit with Peter to wipe his optics as
carefully as possible, as he wondered why it was not his
lot to kick up a similar cloud, to the astonishment of
some other Peter.</p>

<p>Here lay the trouble. Why was not Peter Ploddy
otherwise than he was, if not in circumstances, at least in
personal attributes? Why was he environed by disadvantages,
when the favours of nature and of fortune had
been so profusely distributed around him&mdash;when almost
everybody but himself had something to boast about or
to make capital of?&mdash;There, for instance, was his young
friend Smith, at the apothecary's, over the way&mdash;Smith
was a wit and a mimic&mdash;Smith could imitate all sorts of
things, from the uncorking of a bottle to the plaintive
howl of an imprisoned dog&mdash;his "bumbly-bee" was
equal to any thing of the sort to be heard among the
clover blossoms or in the buckwheat field&mdash;his mosquito
would render a sound sleeper uneasy, and he could perform
a cat's concert so naturally that old Mr. Quiverton,
who is nervous in his slumbers, has thus been made,
more than once, to leap from his bed and dash his slippers
into the yard, as he uttered imprecations upon the
feline race in general and the apothecary's cats in particular.
The gifted Smith! As a calf, too, he was
magnificent. No one in town could bleat half so well.
Why could not Ploddy have accomplishments like Smith?&mdash;accomplishments
which are the instinct of genius, and

<!-- page 8 -->

not attainable by labour. For had not Ploddy tried the
effect of practice? Had he not, in the solitude of his
dormitory, devoted whole evenings to corking and uncorking
a bottle, listening with all the ears he had to its
peculiarities of expression&mdash;had he not given himself
assiduously to the study of the "bumbly-bee"&mdash;endeavoured
to analyze the vocalism of gallinippers, and whined
industriously through successive hours? And with what
result, as the reward of so much intensity of application
and usefulness of labour? A request from Figgs to quit
his infernal noise o' nights, without the least doubt on the
part of that respectable gentleman that the said noise was
Peter's work. He did not even desire him to abstain
from imitations&mdash;he did not recognise imitation in the
matter at all. He spoke only of noise, without the slightest
zoological or entomological allusion. And as for Mrs.
Figgs, when Peter wished to test his progress by an effort
at the "cat's concert" in the open air, did not her nightcap
appear at the window and think that Peter Ploddy&mdash;"you
Pete"&mdash;had better go to bed than stand screeching
there? She did not ask whether it was Pete&mdash;she did not
say " 'scat"&mdash;she knew it was Pete, in the dark. Yet
Smith had never been so disparaged. He could pass for
a cat, or for any thing he pleased. He had no difficulty
in causing people to jump and to cry "get out!" And
hence every one was proud of knowing Smith. It was
equal to a free admission to the menagerie.</p>

<p>Then there was Bill Baritone, at the dry-goods store.
Bill sang delightfully, and was "invited out" every
evening. A serenade was not regarded as complete
without him. Nobody could be in greater demand than
Bill Baritone, whose sentimental strains went to the heart
of every young damsel. But when Peter Ploddy tried
to sing, people stopped their ears&mdash;the neighbours sent
in to know "what's the matter," and the boys in the

<!-- page 9 -->

street were of opinion that something had "broke loose"&mdash;a
species of compliment for which Peter had no great
relish, especially as the droll Mr. Smith had woven the
affair into a story, and gave prime imitations of his vocal
efforts, which were described as a bunch of "keys," and
all sorts of "time," past, present, and to come. Peter
had bought several music books, and had gone so far as
to ask the price of a guitar; but he soon abandoned the
hope of competing with Baritone, though he continued
to wish that he could sing&mdash;at least a little&mdash;just enough
to enable his friends to discover what tune it was, or what
tune it was meant to be. It is so discouraging to be
obliged to tell them the name of it.</p>

<p>Tom Quillet, who was reading law round the corner,
how he could talk&mdash;how he did talk&mdash;how he could
not be prevented from talking! Ploddy had not the
shadow of a chance when Tom was present. In the
first place, Ploddy was not very rapid in raking up an
idea&mdash;it often took him a considerable time to find any
thing to talk about, and to determine whether it was
worth talking about, when he had found it; and then it
was to be brushed up and dressed in words fit to go out.
Tom Quillet, on the contrary, was a walking vocabulary,
who sent forth his words to look for ideas, being but
little particular whether they found them or not; and he
was, therefore, fully entered upon a speech which scorned
subjection to the "one hour rule," before Ploddy had
discovered a corner in his mind where a thought lay burrowing.
Tom, in truth, used his friends as a target, and
remorselessly practised elocution and oratory upon them
on all occasions. He could talk Peter Ploddy right up,
with the greatest ease. He was, in the comparison, like
steam against sails. He could talk all round Peter&mdash;before,
behind, and on every side. Ploddy was not voluble,
and Quillet either brought down or scared away

<!-- page 10 -->

the game, while he was priming his gun to take sight
at it.</p>

<p>"Why can't I express myself like that everlasting
Tom Quillet?" thought Ploddy, in petulance; "what he
says don't often amount to much, to be sure, when you
come to think of it, but it stretches over a deal of ground
and hammers out broad and thin. A little goes a great
way. I wonder if he ever heard anybody but himself
say any thing? I wonder if he believes that any
body but himself has a right to say any thing? How
does he do when he goes to church, I'd like to
know, and must sit still without contradicting or giving
his notions on the subject? How does he manage to
stop his confounded clack long enough to get asleep?&mdash;Should
there ever be a Mrs. Tom Quillet, and should
she ever happen to want to make an observation, which
is very likely, she will die as certain as fate, of not being
allowed to speak her mind. She'll die of a checked utterance
and of a congestion of words. Her thoughts will
be dammed up till she chokes with them. Tom will
never give her a chance. He never gives me one&mdash;not
half a one."</p>

<p>Quillet was a politician, and a rising youth upon the
stump, whither Ploddy ventured not to follow him. His
elocutionary failure in social life had closed the gate of
his ambition in this respect, and he felt assured that to
gain distinction by the power of tongue did not fall
within the compass of possibility, so far as he was concerned.
Still he thought it a great thing to be able to
talk&mdash;to be the operator rather than the patient&mdash;the
surgeon in preference to being the subject&mdash;a Quillet
rather than a Ploddy&mdash;on the general principle which obtains
in warfare, that the offensive is apt to be a surer
game than the defensive, as it affords room for choice in

<!-- page 11 -->

the time and method of attack, whereas the other party is
never safe, and must always be on the <i>qui vive</i>.</p>

<p>All these dashing qualities, with others that might be
named, which are placed first in order as coming first in
Ploddy's estimation, could perhaps have been dispensed
with, had he been able to discover things in himself calculated
to compensate for their absence. As a matter of
immediate concern, he fell back upon his quiet common
sense and sound unobtrusive judgment. We always
think much of our common sense and sound judgment,
when surpassed in more showy characteristics. Almost
everybody has a wonderful degree of judgment&mdash;judgment
more precious than other people's genius; and who
is endowed with talent equal in value to our common
sense? Like the rest of the world, Peter derived consolations
from this source; but it was his youthful desire to
be able to flash and glitter, if he could only discover the
way to excel, or the line for which he was qualified. He
had consumed no little time in fruitless efforts, musical,
mimetic and otherwise, to acquire accomplishments
which were impossibilities to him, as has happened and
will continue to happen in more cases than that of Mr.
Peter Ploddy, and he had encountered both toil and disappointment
to convince himself of disqualifications obvious
from the first to every one except himself. But in
giving up these, he sighed for others equally unattainable.
He saw that every man's life is a story, and that every
man must perforce, and for want of a better, be the hero
of his own story. Now, in examining the magazines,
the nouvellettes, and the historiettes of the day, it will be
discovered that heroes are always tall and generally
valiant. Peter Ploddy was not much above five feet,
and he resigned from the Thunderpump fire company because
he had no fancy for riots, or for being hit over the
head with brass trumpets and iron spanners. He never

<!-- page 12 -->

liked "games of that sort." Heroes are graceful too! but
Ploddy's dancing was not at all admired. It would have
been strange if it had been. Heroes are handsome,
moreover, with dark eyes, clustering curls and umbrageous
whiskers. But the mirror insisted upon it to Ploddy
that he was not handsome&mdash;verging rather in another
direction&mdash;that his eyes were of a dubious lightness, his
hair sandy, and his whiskers discontinuous, uncertain
and sparse. He gazed sadly upon Mr. Daffodil Twod,
the pretty man in the perfumery way and the fancy line.
Sweet Mr. Twod!&mdash;with such loveliness, it is worth
one's while to strap tight and to make costume a science.
But Ploddy was not improvable into any resemblance,
however remote, to the Narcissus family. Nor could he
approximate otherwise to his impressive friend, Samson
Hyde, the currier, who was wild and wonderful,
at the corner of the street. Samson Hyde&mdash;what
a martial figure he was gifted with&mdash;what mountains of
chest, and what acres of shoulder. And his frown&mdash;so
terrific. How Samson Hyde could fight&mdash;how he did
fight, whenever opportunity occurred. "I wish I was
Samson Hyde the currier," ejaculated Ploddy, as he
doubled his fists and endeavoured to scowl Dick, the
shop-boy, into entire and utter annihilation. As Dick
only asked whether Mr. Ploddy had got something in his
eye, that he made such funny faces, Mr. Ploddy felt that
the attempt to pulverize the boy by mesmerization was
an undeniable failure&mdash;he felt at once, as he attempted
to hide his confusion by adjusting a box of candles, that
there was nothing fascinating in his qualities, picturesque
in his appearance, or heroic in his composition&mdash;that he
could not surpass the men, attract the women or confound
the urchins&mdash;that he had not even the genius to make a
fortune at a blow, like Mr. Headover Slapdash, the speculator,
who rolled in wealth and built long rows of houses&mdash;that

<!-- page 13 -->

he had no inward or outward gifts to afford success
or prominence&mdash;undistinguished and undistinguishable
Peter Ploddy, young man to Mr. Figgs, the grocer!</p>

<p>In meditating upon the injustices of nature and the inequalities
of fortune, Peter, even at his post of business,
grew melancholy and abstracted. He sometimes sold
salt for sugar, and sent people honey instead of oil, to fill
their lamps and to illuminate their ways. Mr. Figgs
found it necessary to take him aside and to "talk to him
seriously," which all who have chanced to be subjected
to it know to be as unpleasant an operation as a young
man can undergo and expect to survive. There is
nothing worse than being "talked to seriously," in an
empty room, the door locked and no help at hand,
though elderly gentlemen are so much addicted to it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Figgs, however, with the gentleness peculiar to
her sex, was not so cruel. She had not much faith in
having persons "talked to," and, besides, she was convinced
that the young man must be crossed in love, as
she had an exalted idea of the potency of the tender
passion, particularly among those employed in the retail
grocery business, which she regarded as calculated to
increase the susceptibilities and to soften the heart. Figgs
had been struck with her, and she had been struck with
Figgs, under circumstances of this description, and it had
ever since rendered her firm in the faith that a young
woman, whether she be sent for soap, sugar or tea, is
very likely to be smitten by the insinuating individual
who waits upon her, and that the insinuating individual
himself is in love all the time, and, for the most part, with a
great many at a time. However this may be as a general
rule, though not exactly applicable in the instance under
discussion, it is nevertheless true that employments have
their effect, somewhat in the manner suggested by Mrs.
Figgs. Your baker's boy, for example, who serves customers

<!-- page 14 -->

of a morning&mdash;what a destroyer of hearts is he!
what a concentration of coquettishness, as he goes flirting
from door to door, distributing loaves of bread, words of
love and seductive glances all over town. He is a dangerous
fellow, that same baker's boy&mdash;none the less so
because his experience is so extensive that his own heart
is Cupid-proof, and is rarely, even in extreme cases,
scratched deeper than his tally.</p>

<p>"Peter's crossed in love," repeated Mrs. Figgs, at the
tea-table, in the little back room; "Peter's crossed in
love. He snores so loud you can hear him all over the
house, and that's a sure sign of being blighted in the
affections and nipped in the bud, as a body may say.
First, they snore, and then they borrow pistols, and buy
clothes-lines, and fippenny-bits-worth's of corroding sublimity,
done up in white paper, with the name pasted on
the outside. It is actually shocking the cruelty of us
women," and Mrs. Figgs "wiped away a tear."</p>

<p>"I've heard Peter sythe by the hour," observed Miss
Priscilla Figgs, in corroboration of her mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear," added Mrs. Figgs, "young gentlemen
that have got the mitten, or young gentlemen who
think they are going to get the mitten, always sythe. It
makes 'em feel bad, poor innocent little things, and 'then
they heave a sythe,' as the song says. You should have
heard your father when he was in a state of suspension
about whether I was going to have him or not. Several
people thought it was a porpus."</p>

<p>"Do porpusses get the mitten, ma?" interjected little
Timothy Figgs, who was always on the search for information.
"I didn't think fishes ever wore mittens."</p>

<p>"Pshaw, you're always talking about love and mittens
and stuff, as if people had time for such nonsense now-a-days,"
said Mr. Figgs, sternly. Figgs had survived
his sentimental era, and grew impatient at any reminiscences

<!-- page 15 -->

of it. The reference to the "porpus" nettled him.
"If Peter is crossed as you say, wait till we take an account
of stock next week. That will cure him, I'll be
bound. But the long and the short of it is, that if he
keeps growing stupid, I'll send him adrift. I'm afraid
he is beginning to read books and buys cheap publications.
Reading books is enough to ruin anybody.
There ought to be tee-total societies against it."</p>

<p>But Peter was not then in love, or, if he were, he was
not fully conscious of the fact; nor did he read books
enough to do him material injury. His complaint was
ambition. He wanted to be something, and he did not
know what, which is an embarrassing situation of affairs&mdash;he
cared not what&mdash;rich, handsome, wise, witty, eloquent,
great upon the stump or fierce in regard to whisker&mdash;he
would be a meteor, large or small&mdash;courted or
feared&mdash;loved or envied&mdash;if not a cataract, at least a
ripple on the wave,&mdash;more than Peter Ploddy had ever
been or was like to be,&mdash;as funny as Smith, as musical
as Baritone, as voluble and as impudent as Quillet, as
pretty as Daffodil Twod, as big and as ferocious as
Samson Hyde, as wealthy as Headover Slapdash was
reputed to be.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It was one of those afternoons at the close of the
month of June, which seem to have no end to them&mdash;when
the sun, broad and blazing, appears to be unwilling
to approach the horizon, and endeavours to make the
night his own as well as the day&mdash;when the eye wearies
of excess of light&mdash;when ice-creams are in their first
flush of popularity and little boys paddle in the brook&mdash;when
crops rejoice in green, while people swelter in
white,&mdash;when nature clothes herself thickly in leaves,
while the rest of the world divests itself of garments to
as great an extent as the customs of society will permit.

<!-- page 16 -->

<p>It was such an afternoon as this, and the Figgs family
were abroad for recreation. Dick, the boy, was out on
an errand, trying how many hours could be consumed in
a transit from one given point to another. Peter Ploddy
was alone in the shop, labouring under a suspicion that
customers must have departed this life, and that buying
things had become an "obsolete idea"&mdash;so he availed
himself of the opportunity and of a friction match, to find
recreation in the smoking of a segar. Reclining upon
coffee bags, he puffed and he mused, he mused and he
puffed, until the smoke circled around him in lazy clouds,
and his brain grew as hazy as the atmosphere. Light
faded, sounds melted indistinctly away, and, at last, Peter
imagined that he was rapidly travelling over the gulf of
time, using his coming years for stepping stones, and
anticipating the occurrences of the future, as if he were
turning over the pages of a book of prints. The beginning
and the end were equally within his ken, and, fixing
himself at a point some eight or ten years after date, it
struck him that he would like to know where "funny
Smith" might chance to be at that period.</p>

<p>The place certainly had somewhat the appearance of a
theatre; but of a theatre in a very small way&mdash;of a theatre
in a consumption, and troubled with a difficulty of
breathing. The room itself was not very large, but it
was much too large for the audience, who disposed of
themselves in various picturesque positions, as if desirous
of making up in effect what they wanted in numbers.
One individual had his pedal extremities on the bench
before him, and looked, as it were, from a rest, his elbows
placed upon his knees, while his chin reposed in the
palms of his hands. Another was longitudinally extended,
with his back against the wall; while others intersected
at least three benches in their desire for repose,
lifting their heads at intervals to see what was going on.

<!-- page 17 -->

The gentleman in the window seemed to be as comfortable
as any, in his zigzag attitude, with his feet on one side
and his shoulders on the other; and he had the advantage
too of seeing all that occurred, both inside and out, as
was evident from his frequent remonstrances with certain
juveniles in the street, who were poking him with a stick
because he obstructed their view. "Git down, I tell
you!" cried Zigzag, impatiently, every now and then.
The candles were few and ghastly; a single fiddle comprised
the strength of the orchestra, and it was quite
enough; for had there been more of the same sort, it would
have been a questionable experiment upon the limits of
auricular endurance. Ploddy paid his entrance money to
a faded-looking woman, with one disconsolate child in
her arms, and several others, equally forlorn and unkempt,
hanging about her, while she herself, who, in her own
person, united the offices of treasurer, check-taker and
policeman, (in which latter capacity she often visited the
window aforesaid, to aid Mr. Zigzag in making them
"git down" on the outside,) was a singular compound of
the remains of beauty, of the slattern and of the virago&mdash;care-worn
indeed, but theatrical still, like the odd volume
of a romance, thumbed to tatters in the kitchen. A performer
was sustaining the regular drama by a series of
"barn-yard imitations," which struck Ploddy's ear as
familiar, as also seemed the figure of the imitator, though
his hollow cheeks, painted face and flaxen wig set recognition
for a moment at defiance. The well-known finale
of the "cat's concert," however, dissipated doubt. It
was Smith&mdash;the funny Smith&mdash;the envied Smith, who
soon came round to "the front" to hold the baby and
mind the door, while Mrs. Smith delighted the audience
with a fancy dance. His countenance told a sad tale of
disappointment, poverty and suffering, and rendered explanation
unnecessary.</p>

<!-- page 18 -->

<p>"It is just as well," thought Ploddy, as he slipped
sadly away, "that I never could succeed in being a funny
fellow, and made so poor a business of it at the cat's
concert, and at imitating the bottle and the cork. This
trying to make people laugh every night, from year to
year, especially when their mouths are full of gingerbread,
wouldn't do for me, and doesn't seem to do for Smith.
I'd rather be Ploddy than Smith, if that's the way it's to be."</p>

<p>As Peter went meditating along, musing upon the
melancholy situation to which funny apothecaries, who
think more of creating merriment than of wielding the
pestle, may be reduced, he found himself, at the small
hours of the night, in the streets of the city. He was
startled by the sound of rattles, and almost overthrown
by a rush of tipsy and uproarious gentlemen, who battled
the watch, and would have battled also with Peter,
but that he secured a birds-eye view of the scene from a
lofty flight of steps. Mars proved false to Bacchus, and
victory perched like an eagle upon the banner of the
functionaries.</p>

<p>"Well, bang my kerkus for a drum," panted Dogberry,
"if this 'ere isn't that 'ere singing chap agin. I knows
him by his mulberry nose. He's on a shindy somewhere
or other every night, and gets knock'd down and tuck'd
up three times a week, rig'ler. Old Calico, his daddy-in-law,
has turned him out&mdash;couldn't stand it no longer,
no how it could be fixed; he got so blue and blew it out
so strong. He's a musical genus, you see."</p>

<p>"The corporation should make a contract for ketching
him by the month, or else they should keep him ketch'd
all the time," replied Verges.</p>

<p>"Put the genus in a wheelbarrow," exclaimed Dogberry,
in tones of command, "and make the t'other fellers
walk."</p>

<p>A shade of doubt passed over Peter's mind as to

<!-- page 19 -->

whether the gifts of Bill Baritone had really, and in the
long run, proved of benefit to him, and whether it was
desirable, after all, to enjoy that degree of popularity
which causes a youth to be "invited out" to convivialities
every evening. It was a distinction, perhaps, but
Peter did not exactly like the order to "put the genus in
the wheelbarrow."</p>

<p>"But I must go to Quillet," said Peter, "and ask him
to talk the police people over in the morning, to get poor
Bill out of his troubles."</p>

<p>Quillet, however, had exhaled and evaporated. The
places that had known him, now knew him no more&mdash;no
Quillet at the ward meetings&mdash;no Quillet on the stump.
His talking abilities had converted him at last into a
mere hanger-on of party&mdash;he neglected clients, and clients
returned the compliment by being equally neglectful
of him. People praised him that he might do the work
necessary for political triumph; but when that was accomplished,
it so happened always, that somebody else
reaped the advantage. "Good fellow, Quillet," said
they, "but not popular&mdash;obnoxious&mdash;too much before the
public. Can't recommend him, you know. Habits not
very good&mdash;doesn't attend to his business&mdash;oughtn't to
go to so many meetings;" and the unlucky Quillet was
finally starved out, to do his talking elsewhere.</p>

<p>And the pretty man, in the fancy line, Mr. Twod&mdash;what
disposition had these years made of him? He had
dressed so well and lounged so much in the resorts of
fashion, by way of showing what nature and the tailor had
done for him, that in the end "Twod's Perfumery" was
disposed of at public sale, without the slightest regard to
his feelings on the subject; and some remorseless stripling,
whose face must have been as hard as the contents of his
bosom, had disfigured the door by a chalked inscription
to the effect that "Pretty Mr. Twod is now safe in quod."</p>

<!-- page 20 -->

<p>"A face is not always a fortune," inferred Peter;
"there are decided differences between being useful and
being ornamental;" and he had his own notions on another
subject, when he became impressed with a belief that
Samson Hyde, the currier, had disappeared suddenly, to
avoid the consequences of a fatal fray, in which he was
deeply implicated. Broad shoulders and alarming whiskers
were sinking below par&mdash;a man may have too much
spirit.</p>

<p>Ploddy was not sure, but it struck him that the bar-keeper
at the Spread Eagle had a marvellous resemblance
to Mr. Headover Slapdash, the speculator,&mdash;a
little older, but yet as restless as ever. What had possibly
become of his equipages, his magnificent mansion
in town, his beautiful retreat in the country, his long
rows of houses, and his immense accumulation of lots?
Gone! Could it be? There was nothing more likely.</p>

<p>"How different things seem to be in the end, from
what they promise to be in the beginning," muttered
Peter, as he moved uneasily upon the coffee-bags.
"Strange, strange, very strange," and his foot dislodged
a demijohn from its perch. The crash aroused him from
slumbers and dreams, and he sprang to his feet in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Headover Slapdash has exploded&mdash;didn't you hear
the smash?" shouted Peter.</p>

<p>"Crossed in love, poor thing," said Mrs. Figgs, as
she rummaged for her sympathizing pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Who crossed him, I'd like to know?" cried Priscilla,
with a twinge of jealousy.</p>

<p>"He's becoming foolish," added Figgs.</p>

<p>"He's been asleep, and has had an inkeybus," observed
the youthful Timothy, whose bias was in a scientific
direction.</p>

<p>But Peter was rejoicing that it was only in his imagination

<!-- page 21 -->

that his friends had suffered,&mdash;that however real
and however probable the whole matter appeared, it was
still no more than a dream. There were hints in it, notwithstanding,
which might be rendered useful, not to
himself only, but to the other parties concerned. Peter
was sure, at all events, that he had learned something
about contentment with his position, with his faculties
and with his physical endowments, which he had never
acquired before, although he stood greatly in need of it.
He had, in half an hour or so, anticipated the trying experiences
of years, and saw that every condition has its
compensations&mdash;that the higher the elevation, the more
imminent the danger of a fall&mdash;that brilliancy may
betray to ruin, and that successes are often lures to destruction.
Humbleness looked by no means so despicable
as he had previously considered it.</p>

<p>"Tol de rol!" said Ploddy.</p>

<p>"You can't sing, Peter," remarked Mrs. Ploddy.</p>

<p>"I'm glad of it," returned Ploddy, thinking of "genus"
on the wheelbarrow; "I'll mind my business all the
better."</p>

<p>It was to this observation, coupled with a confirmatory
change in his general business deportment, that Peter
eventually was indebted for his position as a member of
the firm of "Figgs and Ploddy," and a very prosperous,
respectable, and wealthy firm it came to be, owing in part
to Peter's dream, which also gained him the reputation
of being a philosopher, in secretly furnishing the material
for wise discourses upon the folly of inordinate ambition
and vain desires.</p>

<p>There was, however, another event in Peter's life
which deserves to be chronicled as important.</p>

<p>It was evident that there was something on his mind as
he fidgetted before the glass&mdash;an unusual event with him&mdash;and
he rumpled his hair in all directions.</p>

<!-- page 22 -->

<p>"It's labour thrown away, Peter&mdash;you can't make
yourself handsome," hinted Priscilla Figgs, rather maliciously,
as she glanced over her sewing.</p>

<p>But Peter had not been studying himself in the mirror.
His eyes were on the reflected image of Miss Priscilla
Figgs, who was by no means a disagreeable object.
Ploddy had too much taste to look at himself when she
was near.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!&mdash;ho! ho!&mdash;I know it," said Peter; "I've
had a lucky escape."</p>

<p>"Not a very narrow one, I'm sure," replied Priscilla,
tossing her head, "whatever Sally Jones may think."</p>

<p>"Sally who?"</p>

<p>"Sally Jones," responded Priscilla, poutingly. She appeared
uncommonly pretty at that moment, and Peter had
a sensation.</p>

<p>"Now, Priscilla!"</p>

<p>"Now Peter, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't&mdash;I don't know," and Peter drew nearer to
the damsel, whose head was turned coquettishly away,
but not far enough to prevent her downward glance from
noting the progress of the approach.</p>

<p>What explanations were made relative to Sally Jones,
the historian saith not; but the inference is that they
were satisfactory.</p>

<p>"Peter, Peter, there's ma!" cried Miss Priscilla Figgs
as she flew to the opposite side of the room, assuming a
look of intense demureness, which was perhaps a little
overacted, if not also a little contradicted by the mantling
colour of her cheek and the dewy softness of her eyes.</p>

<p>"Let her come," said Peter, with delight, "all the
ma's there are, and pa into the bargain."</p>

<p>Figgs had no objection to Peter as a son-in-law, now
that he had "got over his foolishness," and was so strict
in his attention to business, and "ma" was charmed to

<!-- page 23 -->

think that her theory of the tender passion in reference
to grocers, had been so happily illustrated, the more especially
as she had somewhat risked her reputation upon
it that Peter was in love.</p>

<p>Smith, Baritone, Quillet, Twod and Samson Hyde were
at the wedding, and you may be sure there was a
merry party. Peter told them his dream as a bachelor's
legacy of warning against the dangers to which they
were individually exposed, and the effect was no doubt
salutary. Certain it is, that Peter Ploddy heard the clever
imitations, the funny stories, and the good songs&mdash;listened
to Quillet's neat and appropriate speeches&mdash;saw the pretty
man dance and the valiant man look heroic, without a
shadow of discontent or envy, satisfied to be, in every
particular, as he was and as he was like to be. Priscilla
was decidedly good-looking enough for both, and Peter
Ploddy was a happy man.</p>

<p>THE PRISON VAN; OR, THE BLACK MARIA.*</p>

</div>

<p class="small">[*In Philadelphia, the prisons are remote from the Courts of
Justice, and carriages, which, for obvious reasons, are of a peculiar
construction, are used to convey criminals to and fro. The
popular voice applies the name of "Black Maria" to each of these
melancholy vehicles, and, by general consent, this is their distinguishing
title.]</p>

<p>"HUSH! there she comes!"</p>

<p>It was a pleasant summer morning,&mdash;brightly shone
the sun, and the neighbours gossipped at the door,
Nancy polished the handles&mdash;Susan had the windows
wide open, and, with handkerchief on head, leaned forth
to join in the conversation. Mrs. Jenkins had been at
market, and paused upon the step, with the provision-laden
Polly. There was quite a discussion of the more
agreeable points of domestic economy, and a slight seasoning
of harmless scandal gave piquancy to the discourse.
All were merry. Why, indeed, should they
not be merry? Innocent hearts and balmy weather&mdash;sunshine
within and sunshine without. No wonder their
voices rang so cheerfully. Even Mr. Curmudgeon, over
the way, that splenetic and supercritical bachelor, with
no partner of his bosom but a flannel waistcoat, and
with no objects of his tender care but the neuralgics and
the rheumatics&mdash;even Mr. Curmudgeon chirped, and for
once granted that it was a fine day, with no reservation
whatever about the east wind, and without attempts to
dash the general joy by casting forth suspicions that a
storm was brewing. If he said so&mdash;if Mr. Curmudgeon
confessed the fact&mdash;not a doubt can be entertained&mdash;it
was a fine day beyond the reach of cavil&mdash;a day free
from the reproach of a flaw&mdash;with no lingering dampness

<!-- page 25 -->

from yesterday, and with no cloud casting its shadow before,
prospective of sorrows to-morrow.</p>

<p>In short, every thing looked warm, cheerful, and gay&mdash;the
Nancies, the Pollies, and the Susans were prettier
than usual&mdash;there are pretty days as well as lucky days&mdash;when
cheeks are more glowing and eyes are more brilliant
than on ordinary occasions&mdash;when Mrs. Jenkins is
more pleasant than is the won't even of pleasant Mrs.
Jenkins, and when the extensive brotherhood of the Curmudgeons
pat children on the head, and give them
pennies&mdash;days when one feels as if he were all heart, and
were gifted with the capacity to fall in love with everybody&mdash;happy
days! The day of which we speak was
one of these days&mdash;nature smiled, and the people smiled
in return. Nature approached as near to a laugh as was
becoming in a matron at her time of life and with so large
a family, while the people did laugh with the smallest
provocation thereto.</p>

<p>"Hush! there she comes!" said somebody, in tones
of commingled fear and curiosity.</p>

<p>"Who comes?"</p>

<p>The finger of the speaker pointed steadfastly down the
street.</p>

<p>"Who comes?"</p>

<p>"Black Maria!" was the half-whispered reply.</p>

<p>Conversation ceased&mdash;a shade of gloom passed over
every brow&mdash;all gazed in the direction indicated&mdash;it was
a melancholy pause&mdash;a pause of sad attention.</p>

<p>"Black Maria!" was the unconscious and involuntary
response.</p>

<p>The children looked behind them, as if to ascertain
whether the doors were open for retreat into the recesses
of home, and then peeped timidly and cautiously around
the skirts of their mothers. The mirth of their seniors
was also checked in mid career.</p>

<!-- page 26 -->

<p>" 'Black Maria,' sissy," said curly-headed Tom, and
"sissy" clasped Tom's hand with the energy of apprehension.</p>

<p>" 'Black Maria,' Tom!" repeated his aunt, with an
air of warning and admonition, at which Tom seemed to
understand a whole history, and was abashed.</p>

<p>"Black Maria!"</p>

<p>Who was this strange creature&mdash;this Black Maria&mdash;that
came like a cloud across the ruddy day&mdash;that chills
the heart wherever she passes? What manner of thing
is it which thus frowns gayety itself into silence?&mdash;Black
Maria!&mdash;Is she some dark enchantress, on whose swart
and sullen brow malignity sits enthroned?&mdash;or is pestilence
abroad, tangible and apparent?</p>

<p>The "Black Maria" goes lumbering by. It is but a
wagon, after all&mdash;a wagon so mysteriously named&mdash;a
wagon, however, which is itself alone&mdash;not one of the
great family of carts, with general similitude and vast relationship,
but an instrument of progression which has
"no brother&mdash;is like no brother." It creaks no salutation
to wheeled cousins, as it wends its sulky way&mdash;it
has no family ties to enable it to find kith and kin, more
or less humble and more or less proud, in the long line
of gradation, from the retiring wheelbarrow up to the
haughty and obtrusive chariot. It is unique in form and
purpose&mdash;it has a task which others are unfitted to encounter,
and it asks no help in the discharge of duties.
It moves scornfully among hacks and cabs, while even
the dray appears to regard it with a compound feeling of
dread and disdain. It is, as we may say, a vehicular
outcast, hated but yet feared&mdash;grand, gloomy and peculiar&mdash;a
Byron among less gifted but more moral carriages&mdash;tragedy
amid the niceties of commonplace. Such
is the social isolation of the "Black Maria." Even in
its hour of repose&mdash;in its stabular retreats, the gig caresses

<!-- page 27 -->

it not, nor does the carriole embrace it within its shafts.
The respectability of the stalls shrinks from contact with
the "Black Maria," and its nights are passed in the open
court-yard. Nor is it to be wondered at. The very
<i>physique</i> of the "Black Maria" is repulsive, apart from
the refinements of mere association. What is it&mdash;a coffin,
rude but gigantic, travelling to and fro, between the
undertaker and the sexton? Why is it that the eye fails
to penetrate its dark recesses? No "sashes" adorn the
person of the "Black Maria." Unlike all other vehicles,
it has no apertures for light and air, save those openings
beneath the roof, from which a haggard and uneasy glance
flashes forth at intervals, or from which protrudes a hand
waving, as it were, a last farewell to all that gives delight
to existence. Sternly and rigidly sits the guard in the
rearward chamber, and beyond him is a door heavy with
steel. It is no pleasure carriage then&mdash;it is not used as
a means of recreation nor as a free-will conveyance, travelling
at the guidance of those who rest within. No&mdash;they
who take seats in the "Black Maria" feel no honour
in their elevation&mdash;they ride neither for health nor amusement.
They neither say "drive on," nor designate the
place of destination. If it were left to them, they would,
in all likelihood, ask to be taken another way, and they
would sooner trot on foot for ever, than to be thus raised
above contact with mud and mire. They are not impatient
either&mdash;they make no objection to the slowness of
the gait. In short, they would like to get out and dismiss
all cumbrous pomp and ceremonious attendance.</p>

<p>But there are bars between&mdash;yes, bolts and bars, and
there is nothing of complaisance on the brow of him who
has these iron fastenings at control. Polite requests
would be unheeded, and he has heard the curses of despair&mdash;the
sobs of remorse&mdash;the bitter wailings of heart-broken
wretchedness too often to be much moved by

<!-- page 28 -->

solicitations such as these. Nor is he to be shaken by
the fierce regards of hardened recklessness. Even the
homicide may threaten&mdash;red murder itself may glower
upon him with its fevered glare; but there is neither
weakness nor terror in the hard business-like deportment
with which he silences the exuberance of lacerated feeling.
He is but a check-taker at the door, and cares
naught about the play within. Tears may fall&mdash;convulsive
sorrow may rend the frame; but what is that to him
whose limited service it is to watch and ward&mdash;to keep
them in and keep them out? To weep is not his vocation,
who sits at the door. He has no part in the drama,
and is no more bound to suffer than they who snuff the
candles for the stage. His emotions are for home consumption&mdash;his
sympathies are elsewhere&mdash;left behind with
his better coat and hat, and well it is so, or they would
soon be torn to tatters&mdash;all&mdash;heart, cloth, and beaver.</p>

<p>What, then, is this "Black Maria," so jocularly
named, yet so sad in its attributes? The progress of time
brings new inventions&mdash;necessity leads to many deviations
from the beaten track of custom, and the criminal,
in earlier days dragged through crowded streets by the
inexorable officers of the law, exposed to the scorn,
derision or pity, as the case might be, of every spectator,
now finds a preliminary dungeon awaiting him at the very
portals of justice&mdash;a locomotive cell&mdash;a penitentiary upon
wheels. He is incarcerated in advance, and he begins
his probationary term at the steps of the court-house.
Once there was an interval:</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">"Some space between the theatre and grave;"</p>

</div>

<p>some breathing time from judge and jury to the jailer,&mdash;a
space to be traversed, with the chances incident to a
journey. Constables on foot are but flesh and blood,
after all, and an adroit blow from a brawny thief has often
laid them prostrate. A short quick evasion of the body

<!-- page 29 -->

has extricated the collar from many a muscular grasp, and
once it was a thing of not unfrequent occurrence that the
rogue flew down the street, diving into all sorts of interminable
alleys, while panting tipstaves "toiled after
him in vain." There were no cowardly, sneaking
advantages taken then&mdash;enterprise was not cabined in a
perambulating chicken-coop&mdash;valour had room to swing
its elbow, and some opportunity to trip up the heels of
the law. But as things are at present managed, a man
is in prison as he traverses the city&mdash;in prison, with but
a plank between him and the moving concourse of the
free&mdash;in prison, while the horses start at the crack of the
whip&mdash;in prison, as he whirls around the corner&mdash;in prison,
yet moving from place to place&mdash;jolted in prison&mdash;perhaps
upset in prison. He hears the voices of the
people&mdash;the din of traffic&mdash;the clamours of trade&mdash;the
very dogs run barking after him, and he is jarred by
rough collisions; but still he is in prison&mdash;more painfully
in prison, by the bitterness of intruding contrast, than if
he were immured beyond all reach of exterior sound; and
when the huge gates of his place of destination creak
upon their hinges, to the harsh rattling of the keeper's
key, the captive, it may be, rejoices that the busy world
is no longer about him, mocking his wretchedness with
its cheerful hum.</p>

<p>If it were in accordance with the spirit of the age to
refine upon punishment and to seek aggravation for
misery, the "Black Maria" would perhaps furnish a hint
that the pang might be rendered sharper, by secluding
the felon from liberty by the most minute interval&mdash;that
freedom might be heard, yet not seen&mdash;as the music of
the ball-room fitfully reaches the chamber of disease and
suffering&mdash;that he might be in the deepest shadow, yet
know that light is beaming close around him; in the centre
of action, yet deprived of its excitements&mdash;isolated in

<!-- page 30 -->

the midst of multitudes&mdash;almost jostled by an invisible
concourse&mdash;dead yet living&mdash;a sentient corpse.</p>

<p>It is not then to be marvelled at that the "Black
Maria" causes a sensation by her ominous presence&mdash;that
labour rests from toil when the sound of her wheels
is heard&mdash;that the youthful shrink and the old look sad,
as she passes by. Nor is it strange that even when empty
she is encircled by a curious but meditative crowd, scanning
the horses with a degree of reverential attention
which unofficial horses, though they were Barbary coursers
or Andalusian steeds, might vainly hope to excite.
The very harness is regarded with trepidation, and the driver
is respectfully scrutinized from head to foot, as if he
were something more or less than man; and if the guard
does but carelessly move his foot, the throng give back
lest they should unwittingly interfere with one who is
looked upon as the ultimatum of criminal justice. Should
the fatal entrance be left unclosed, see how the observant
spectator man&oelig;uvres to obtain a knowledge of its interior,
without approaching too closely, as if he laboured
under an apprehension that the hungry creature would
yawn and swallow him, as it has swallowed so many,
body, boots, and reputation. Now, he walks slowly to
the left hand, that he may become acquainted with every
particular of the internal economy afforded by that point
of view. Again, he diverges to the right, on another
quest for information. Do not be surprised, if he were
also to "squat," and from that graceful posture glance
upwards to ascertain the condition of the flooring, or sidle
about to note the style of the lynch-pins. A mysterious
interest envelopes the "Black Maria;" every feature
about her receives its comment&mdash;she has not a lineament
which is not honoured by a daily perusal from the public.
She is the minister of justice&mdash;the great avenger&mdash;the
receptacle into which crime is almost sure to fall, and as

<!-- page 31 -->

she conveys the prisoner to trial or bears him to the fulfilment
of sentence, she is still the inspirer of terror. There
may be some, no doubt&mdash;perhaps there may be many&mdash;who
have forebodings at her approach, and tremble as
she passes, with an anticipation of such a ride for themselves.
Could upbraiding conscience come more fearfully
than in this "Black Maria's" shape, or could the sleeping
sinner have compunctious visitings more terrible than
the dream in which he imagines himself handed into this
penitential omnibus, as an atonement for past offences?
What, let us ask, can be more appalling than the "Black
Maria" of a guilty mind?</p>

<p>It is a matter of regret that history must be the work
of human hands&mdash;that the quill must be driven to preserve
a record of the past, and that inanimate objects&mdash;cold,
passionless, and impartial witnesses&mdash;are not gifted
with memory and speech. Much has been done&mdash;a long
array of successive centuries have fidgeted and fumed;
but, after all, it is little we know of the action of those
who have gone before. But if a jacket now were capable
of talk, then there would be biography in earnest.
We would all have our Boswells, better Boswells than
Johnson's Boswell. A dilapidated coat might be the
most venerable and impressive of moralists. Much could
it recount of frailty, and the results of frailty, in those
who have worn it; furnishing sermons more potent than
the polished compositions of the closet. Could each
house narrate what it has known of every occupant,
human nature might be more thoroughly understood than
it is at present. What beacons might not every apartment
set up, to warn us from the folly which made shipwreck
of our predecessors! Even the mirror, while
flattering vanity, could tell, an it would, how beauty,
grown wild with its own excess, fell into premature
decay. Ho! ho! how the old goblet would ring, as we

<!-- page 32 -->

drain the sparkling draught, to think of the many such
scenes of roaring jollity it has witnessed, and of the multitude
of just such jovial fellows as are now carousing,
it has sent to rest before their time, under the pretence of
making them merry! Wine, ho! let the bottle speak.
Your bottle has its experiences&mdash;a decanter has seen the
world. Thou tattered robe&mdash;once fine, but now decayed&mdash;nobility
in ruins&mdash;how sourly thou smilest to discourse
of the fall from drawing-rooms to pawn-brokers'
recesses. What a history is thine&mdash;feeble art thou&mdash;very
thin and threadbare; still thou hast seen more of weakness,
ay, in men and women too, than is now displayed
in thine own ruin. Yea, cobble those boots for sooterkin&mdash;they
are agape, indeed; yet were once thought fit ornaments
for the foot of fashion. Leathern patchwork,
thou hast been in strange places in thy time, or we are
much mistaken. Come, thy many mouths are open, and
thy complexion scarce admits of blushing&mdash;tell us about
thy furtive wanderings.</p>

<p>Let then this "Black Maria" wag her tongue&mdash;for
tongue she has, and something of the longest&mdash;and she
would chatter fast enough, I warrant me. Let us regard
her as a magazine of memoirs&mdash;a whole library of personal
detail, and as her prisoners descend the steps, let
us gather a leaf or two.</p>

<p>Here comes one&mdash;a woman&mdash;traces of comeliness still
linger even amid the more enduring marks of sin, poverty,
and sorrow. Her story has been told before, in thousands
of instances, and it will be told again and again and again
There is not much that is new in the downward career of
those who fall. It is an old routine. Giddiness, folly, and
deception, it may be, at the outset&mdash;remorse, misery,
and early death, at the close. Yes, yes&mdash;the old father
was humble in his ploddings&mdash;the mother had no aspirings
above her sphere; but she who now is weeping bitter

<!-- page 33 -->

tears, she longed for silks and satins and gay company.
It was but a cracked and crooked looking-glass that told
her she was beautiful, but its pleasing tale was easily believed&mdash;for
perfumed youths endorsed its truth, and whispered
Fanny that she was worthy of a higher lot than that
of toiling the humble wife of dingy labour. Those secret
meetings&mdash;those long walks by moonlight&mdash;those stories
of soft affection, and those brilliant hopes! Day by day
home grew more distasteful&mdash;its recurring cares more
wearying&mdash;the slightest rebuke more harsh, and Fanny
fled. That home is desolate now. The old father is
dead, the mother dependent upon charity, and the daughter
is here, the companion of felons, if not a felon herself.</p>

<p>Another!&mdash;that dogged look, man, scarcely hides the
wretchedness within. You may, if it seems best before
these idle starers, assume the mask of sullen fierceness.
"Who cares," is all well enough, indeed, but still the
thought travels back to days of innocence and happiness.
You set out in the pursuit of pleasure and enjoyment, but
it has come to this at last; all your frolickings and drinkings&mdash;your
feastings, your ridings, and your gamblings.
You were trusted once, I hear&mdash;your wife and children
were happy around you. But you were not content.
There were chances to grow rich rapidly&mdash;to enjoy a
luxurious ease all your life, and to compass these you
were false to your trust. Shame and disgrace ensued;
dissipation environed your footsteps, and more daring vice
soon followed. It is a short step from the doings of the
swindler to the desperate acts of the burglar or the counterfeiter.
You, at least, have found it so. Well, glare
sternly about you&mdash;turn upon the spectators with the
bitter smile of defiance. It will be different anon, in
hopeless solitude&mdash;the past strewed with the wreck of
reputation&mdash;the future all sterility.</p>

<p>Here is one who had a golden infancy. Where was

<!-- page 34 -->

there a child more beautiful than he? No wonder his
parents thought no cost too great for his adornment.
Who can be surprised that caresses were lavished upon
the darling, and that his tender years knew no restraint.
But it was a strange return in after time, that he should
break his mother's heart&mdash;plunder his father, and become
an outcast in the lowest haunts of vice. Were the graces
of Apollo bestowed for such a purpose?</p>

<p>This fellow, now, was destroyed by too much severity.
His childhood was manacled by control. Innocent pleasures
were denied&mdash;his slightest faults were roundly
punished&mdash;there was no indulgence. He was to be
scourged into a virtuous life, and, therefore, falsehood
and deceit became habitual&mdash;yes, even before he knew
they were falsehood and deceit; but that knowledge did
not much startle him, when the alternative was a lie or
the lash. Had the cords of authority been slackened a
little, this man might have been saved; but while the
process of whipping into goodness was going on, he paid
a final visit to the treasury and disappeared. Being
acquainted with no other principle of moral government
than that of fear and coercion, he continues to practise
upon it, and helps himself whenever the opportunity
seems to present itself of doing so with no pressing
danger of disagreeable consequences. Mistakes, of
course, are incident to his mode of life. Blunders will
occur, and, in this way, the gentleman has had the pleasure
of several rides in the "Black Maria."</p>

<p>Here is an individual, who was a "good fellow,"&mdash;the
prince of good fellows&mdash;a most excellent heart&mdash;so
much heart, indeed, that it filled not only his bosom, but
his head also, leaving scant room for other furniture.
He never said "no" in his life, and invariably took
advice when it came from the wrong quarter. He was
always so much afraid that people would be offended, if

<!-- page 35 -->

he happened not to agree with them, that he forgot all
about his own individual responsibility, and seemed to
think that he was an appendage and nothing more.
Dicky Facile, at one time, had a faint consciousness of
the fact, when he had taken wine enough, and would say,
"No, I thank you," if requested to mend his draught.
But if it were urged, "Pooh! nonsense! a little more
won't hurt you," he would reply, "Won't it, indeed?"
and recollect nothing from that time till he woke next
day in a fever. Dicky lent John his employer's cash,
because he loved to accommodate; and finally obliged
the same John by imitating his employer's signature,
because John promised to make it all right in good time;
but John was oblivious.</p>

<p>The "Black Maria" has a voluminous budget,&mdash;she
could talk all day without pausing to take breath. She
could show how one of her passengers reached his seat
by means of his vocal accomplishments, and went musically
to destruction, like the swan&mdash;how another had such
curly hair that admiration was the death of him&mdash;how
another was so fond of being jolly that he never paused
until he became sad&mdash;how another loved horses until
they threw him, or had a taste for elevated associations
until he fell by climbing&mdash;how easily, in fact, the excess
of a virtue leads into a vice, so that generosity declines
into wastefulness, spirit roughens into brutality, social
tendencies melt into debauchery, and complaisance opens
the road to crime. We are poor creatures all, at the
best, and perhaps it would not be amiss to look into
ourselves a little before we entertain hard thoughts of
those who chance to ride in the "Black Maria;" for, as
an ex-driver of that respectable caravan used to observe,
"there are, I guess, about two sorts of people in this
world&mdash;them that's found out, and them that ain't found
out&mdash;them that gets into the 'Black Maria,' and them

<!-- page 36 -->

that don't happen to be cotch'd. People that are
cotch'd, has to ketch it, of course, or else how would
the 'fishal folks&mdash;me and the judges and the lawyers&mdash;yes,
and the chaps that make the laws and sell the law
books&mdash;make out to get a livin'? But, on the general
principle, this argufies nothin'. Being cotch'd makes no
great difference, only in the looks of things; and it happens
often enough, I guess, that the wirchis looking gentleman
who turns up his nose at folks, when the constable's
got 'em, is only wirchis because he hasn't been
found out. That's my notion."</p>

<p>And not a bad notion either, most philosophic Swizzle,
only for the fault of your class&mdash;a little too much of generalization.
Your theory, perhaps, is too trenchant&mdash;too
horizontal in its line of division. But it too often happens
that the worst of people are not those who take the air in
the "Black Maria."</p>

<p>Still, however, you that dwell in cities, let not this
moral rumble by in vain. Wisdom follows on your
footsteps, drawn by horses. Experience is wagoned
through the streets, and though your temptations be many,
while danger seems afar off, yet the catastrophe of your
aberrations is prophetically before the eye, creaking and
groaning on its four ungainly wheels. The very whip
cracks a warning, and the whole vehicle displays itself
as a travelling caution to all who are prone to sin. It is
good for those who stand, to take heed lest they fall.
But we have an addition here which should be even
more impressive, in these times of stirring emulation.
Take heed, lest in your haste to pluck the flowers of life
without due labour in the field, you chance to encounter,
not a fall alone, but such a ride as it has been our endeavour
to describe&mdash;a ride in the "Black Maria."</p>

<p>SLYDER DOWNEHYLLE.</p>

<p class="small">A SEARCH AFTER HAPPINESS.</p>

</div>

<p>"HOW happy I'll be to-morrow!" exclaimed little Slyder
Downehylle, in anticipation of Christmas; "oh, how
happy I shall be to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"Couldn't you contrive to be happy a little now?"
replied Uncle John, who had learned somewhat to distrust
anticipation and its gorgeous promises.</p>

<p>"Happy now, Uncle John!" retorted little Slyder
Downehylle, rather contemptuously, "happy now!&mdash;what
with, I should like to know&mdash;what shall I be happy with&mdash;now?
Where's the candy, the cakes, the pies&mdash;where
is the hobby-horse that somebody's going to give
me&mdash;and all the Christmas gifts? How I wish to-morrow
had come&mdash;what a long day&mdash;what a long evening&mdash;what
a great while I've got to sleep!"</p>

<p>Little Slyder Downehylle became quite cross, and
Uncle John whistled. Twenty-four hours afterward, little
Slyder Downehylle was still more cross&mdash;he had been
happy with candy, with cakes and with pies, until he
was very uncomfortable indeed; he had been happy with
toys, until he had quarrelled with his little companions
and strewed the room with broken playthings; he had
been happy with his hobby-horse, until he got a fall.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a stupid day!" said little Slyder Downehylle,
"I wish to-morrow would come&mdash;I'll be so happy
at Aunt Betsy's."</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to intrude at Aunt Betsy's, for the
events there were of a character strongly resembling what
had already occurred. Little Slyder Downehylle went
to bed in tears.</p>

<!-- page 38 -->

<p>It was always so with the unfortunate Slyder Downehylle.
Throughout life, he wanted something to be
happy with; and strangely enough, it universally occurred
that when he had obtained the thing, it did not prove to
be exactly the thing he wanted. His expectations were
never realized, and he was, therefore, constantly in a state
of disappointment. Unlucky Slyder Downehylle! It
was deplorable too that such should be the case, for Slyder
Downehylle was anxious to be happy&mdash;he was always
looking forward to be happy&mdash;for something "to be happy
with." He never got up in the morning but that it was
his resolve to be happy in the afternoon&mdash;and, if not successful
in accomplishing his purpose at that time, he endeavoured,
as far as possible, to retrieve the failure by forming
a similar determination for the evening. No one ever
had a greater variety of schemes for living happy&mdash;very
happy&mdash;than he; for living happy next week, for living
happy next month, or next year; but it appeared to him
that a malignant fate was sure to interfere, in order that
his projects might be frustrated. At school, he was
always thinking how happy he would be on Saturday
afternoon; but then sometimes it rained on Saturday
afternoon, or his companions would not do as he wished
them to do on Saturday afternoon, or it may be that,
although he had toiled hard for pleasure on Saturday afternoon,
and the toil for pleasure is often the severest of
work, he returned home weary, dispirited, and out of
temper. Of course, it was unavoidable that his pleasure
should be postponed until some other Saturday afternoon.
And it was even so with the larger holidays. They
never were exactly what they ought to have been&mdash;what
they promised to be&mdash;what they seemed to be, when
viewed from a distance. If Slyder Downehylle went a
fishing, why a treacherous bank would often give way,
and then&mdash;pray, who can possibly be happy when dripping

<!-- page 39 -->

wet, with his clothes on? Nobody but poodles.
What felicity is there in losing one's shoe in a swamp?
Who is perfectly happy when scouring across the plain,
like "swift Camilla," with old Jenkins' big dog&mdash;that
dog always bites&mdash;rustic dogs do&mdash;following close at his
heels, widely opening a mouth which shows no need
of the dentist? Then, if Slyder Downehylle went skating,
it not unfrequently happened that he cried with cold,&mdash;what
a strange arrangement it is not to have the best
of skating on the warmest days! At other seasons, there
was the sun. It never rains but it pours, in this world.
Is it happiness, think ye, to have one's dear little nose&mdash;incipient
Roman, or determined pug, as the case may
be&mdash;all of a blister, and to have one's delectable countenance
as red and as hot as a scarlet fever? "There's
lime in the sack"&mdash;invariably, in Slyder Downehylle's
sack&mdash;it would be easy to make mortar of it.</p>

<p>The young Downehylle, finding that happiness eluded
his grasp while a boy, made sure of throwing a noose
over its head when he should be a man. What on earth
is there to prevent a man's being happy, if he chooses&mdash;especially
if a man has money, as was the case in the
present instance. Uncle John and Aunt Betsy both being
gathered to their fathers and mothers. May not a man
do as he pleases?&mdash;go to bed when he pleases, and get
up when he pleases?&mdash;eat what he pleases and drink
what he pleases? A man is not compelled to learn lessons.
All his afternoons are Saturday afternoons&mdash;his
holidays last all the year round. Who would not be a
man?  "Oh, when I am a man!" said Slyder Downehylle.
"I wish I was a man!" exclaimed Slyder Downehylle.
"I want to be a man!" cried Slyder Downehylle,
with impatience.</p>

<p>Sooner or later, at least in the eye of the law, most
boys become men, in despite of remonstrance. These

<!-- page 40 -->

boys are remarkable for an upstart tendency, and the
Downehylles themselves are not exempt from the peculiarity.
So Slyder Downehylle was a man at last, though,
on the whole, it must be confessed that he did not derive
the satisfaction from it that he had been led to expect.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Slyder Downehylle was extended at full length upon
a sofa.</p>

<p>"I say, Spifflikens, what shall I be at? I'm twenty-one&mdash;I've
got plenty of money&mdash;I'm as tired as thunder
already&mdash;what shall I be at, Spifflikens?"</p>

<p>"Lend me a hundred, and buy yourself a buggy,&mdash;why
don't you get a buggy, to begin with?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Spifflikens, I will. You're right&mdash;the Downehylles
were always great on buggies, you know, Spifflikens."</p>

<p>It was Slyder Downehylle's theory, after this conversation&mdash;for
he often theorized&mdash;that happiness was, to
some degree, vehicular; that, like respectability, it was
to be found in a gig, if it were to be found anywhere.
He, therefore, bought him a sulky and a fast trotter&mdash;a
mile in two minutes or thereabouts. What could escape
a man who followed so rapidly? If you wish to be successful
in the pursuit of happiness, do not forget to buy a
sulky&mdash;there's nothing like a sulky.</p>

<p>"Aha!&mdash;that's it!" muttered Slyder Downehylle, as he
tugged at the reins, and went whizzing along the turnpike
in a cloud of dust, passing every thing on the road,
and carrying consternation among the pigs, the ducks,
and the chickens.</p>

<p>Slyder thought that this was "it" for several consecutive
days; but as the novelty wore off&mdash;there's the rub&mdash;(that
Hamlet was rather a sensible fellow&mdash;did he too
keep a "fast trotter?")&mdash;Slyder was not so sure whether
it was the thing exactly, and on the recommendation of

<!-- page 41 -->

his friend Spifflikens, who borrowed another hundred on
the occasion, he endeavoured to improve it a little by
drinking champagne and playing billiards at the "Cottage."
Fast trotters and champagne&mdash;fast trotters and
billiards harmonize very well. Under this combination,
Slyder appeared to think that "it" was considerably
more like the thing than before. He had found "something
to be happy with," at last, and so had Spifflikens.
It was not, however, so difficult to make Spiffy a happy
man,&mdash;only allow him to go ahead, and say nothing
about "returns." He hates any thing sombre&mdash;any thing
"dun."</p>

<p>"Now I'm happy," said Slyder Downehylle, as he
stood on the portico of the "Cottage," and saw every eye
fixed with admiration on his establishment, as the boy
led his horse and sulky through the crowd of vehicles.
"That's it, at last!" and he lighted another cigar and
called for an additional bottle of iced champagne. "That's
it, certainly," remarked Spifflikens, at the explosion of
the cork.</p>

<p>Slyder Downehylle was perfectly satisfied that this was
indeed "it," for a considerable portion of the afternoon,
and, to tell the truth, when he remounted his buggy,
nodding his head to the bystanders, as he hung his coat-tails
over the back of the vehicle, he was not a little
"elevated."</p>

<p>"There&mdash;let him go!" said he, tossing a half-dollar to
the hostler's deputy.</p>

<p>Mr. Downehylle's sulky flew like lightning across the
lawn.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" ejaculated the spectators.</p>

<p>"Superiaw&mdash;fine!" added Spifflikens.</p>

<p>The dogs barked&mdash;the coloured gentlemen, who officiated
as waiters, grinned from ear to ear.&mdash;There was quite
a sensation at the "Cottage."</p>

<!-- page 42 -->

<p>"That's it, at last!" said Slyder Downehylle, triumphantly.
But he forgot that existence, short as it is, cannot
be crowded all into the exhilarating moment of a
"start." Life is not to be distilled and condensed in this
way, though his life seemed to come as near it as possible,
on the occasion referred to.</p>

<p>Why are we made ambitious? Why will we endeavour
to jump over puddles that are too wide, when we
so often miss immortality by no more than a hair's
breadth? But "touch and go" is the secret of great
enterprises. Slyder Downehylle was struck with a desire
to sublimate the sublime&mdash;to "o'ertop old Pelion,"
and old Pelion, as it was natural he should, resented the
insult. Downehylle was allowed to "touch"&mdash;we
often do that&mdash;but there was a veto on his "go." He
wished to shave the gate-post, in his curricular enthusiasm&mdash;to
astonish the natives with his charioteering skill.
Yet the poplars might have reminded him of Phaeton&mdash;of
Phaeton's sisters weeping, lank and long.</p>

<p>It certainly was the champagne&mdash;that last bottle, so
well iced.</p>

<p>Mr. Downehylle was out in his calculation by about
the sixteenth part of an inch. He was on a lee-shore.</p>

<p>A cloud of splinters went up and came down again.
"There is but a Frenchman the more in France," said a
Bourbon on the Restoration. It was also quite evident
that there was a sulky the less in existence. As this
could not be considered the "fast trotter's" business&mdash;he
having no further concern with the matter than to do
a certain number of miles in a specific number of minutes&mdash;he,
therefore, went straight on to fulfil his part of
the contract, and it is to be presumed that he was successful,
as nothing has been heard from him since.</p>

<p>"That's not it, after all," murmured Mr. Slyder Downehylle,
as he was carried into the Cottage for surgical aid.</p>

<!-- page 43 -->

<p>The bystanders, lately so full of admiration, ungraciously
placed their thumbs upon their noses, and waggled
their fingers. Greatness always falls when it meets
with an upset.</p>

<p>"What could you expect from a fellow that holds his
elbows so, when he drives?" was the general remark.
When we are down, every one can see the reason why.
The world is always full of sagacity, after the event.</p>

<p>Slyder Downehylle is known by the coloured waiters
at the Cottage as "the gemplin that got spilt," and he
was so knocked down by the affair that he felt flat at the
slightest allusion to it. He never hunted happiness in a
buggy again, but went slowly home in the omnibus, and,
though it did not enable him to journey very rapidly, he
yet contrived, while in it, to arrive at the conclusion that,
if "fast trotters" carried others to felicity, the mode of
travel was too rough for him.</p>

<p>He was puzzled. What could be the matter? He
was a man, a man of cash&mdash;money in both pockets; but
yet Slyder Downehylle was not happy&mdash;not particularly
happy. On the contrary, striking an average, he was,
for the most part, decidedly miserable. He yawned
about all the morning; he was not hungry in the afternoon;
he was seldom sleepy at night,&mdash;vexatious!</p>

<p>"There's something I want," thought Slyder Downehylle;
"but what it is&mdash;that's more than I can tell; but
it is something to be happy with. What other people
get for the purpose, that they go grinning about so, hang
me if I can discover."</p>

<p>Slyder Downehylle was rather good-looking, about these
times&mdash;not decidedly "a love," but well enough; and so,
as nature had been propitious, he struck out in a new line&mdash;a
very popular line&mdash;the hair line. He cultivated whiskers,
"fringing the base of his countenance;" he set up a
moustache; he starred his under lip with an imperial, and

<!-- page 44 -->

he balanced the superstructure with the classical "goatee."
Medusa herself never had more luxuriant curls. When
Slyder Downehylle wanted to find himself, he was obliged
to beat the bushes. He passed half the day with a brush
in his hand, in adjusting his embellishments&mdash;in giving
them the irresistible expression; and the rest of the time
was consumed in carrying them up and down all manner of
streets, and to all sorts of public places. Slyder Downehylle
was now the envy of the young bloods about town,
and was regarded as a perfect Cupidon by the ladies.
How, indeed, could it be otherwise! Birnam Wood had
come to Dunsinane&mdash;not a feature was discernible. Esau
and Orson were shavelings and shavers to Slyder Downehylle.
But, notwithstanding the fact that Samson found
strength in his hair, Slyder was not so lucky. A thick-set
hedge cannot keep out ennui. It is true that the buffalo
and the bison at the menagerie, took Mr. Slyder
Downehylle for a patriarch of the tribe, fresh from the head
waters of the Oregon; yet, after all, Slyder's spirit was
nearly as bald of comfort as the "hairless horse"&mdash;that
unfashionable quadruped. It must be confessed, however,
that there were gleams of consolation attendant upon
his bristly condition. The servants at the hotels styled
him "mounsheer." How delightful it is to be mistaken
for what you are not! People thought he talked "pretty
good English, considerin'," and, best of all, the little
boys ran backwards that they might look with wonder at
his face, while the smaller children went screaming into
the house to call their mammas to see the "funny thing."
But "false is the light on glory's plume;" and it is no
less false on glory's hair. Even the excitement of such
enviable distinction as this soon wears away, and it may
be questioned whether, barring the expense of soap, a
furry-faced gentleman is, in the long run, much happier
than the more sober citizen who has so little taste for the

<!-- page 45 -->

picturesque as to shave several times a week, and who is
neither a "foundling of the forest" nor a perambulatory
Moses, always among the bulrushes.</p>

<p>Slyder Downehylle, therefore, reinforced his whiskers
by an elaborate care in dress. He was padded into a
model of symmetry; but, although the buckram was judiciously
placed, he soon ascertained that this was not the
kind of bolstering he wanted. The cotton made him
warm, but it did not make him happy&mdash;not quite. It
was "nothing to be thus," unless one were "safely thus."
Slyder Downehylle began to feel small, when his muscular
developments were hung upon the bed-post. Which
was Slyder, in the main&mdash;he beneath the cover, or that
larger part of him against the wall? He was tired of
packing and unpacking; wearied with being "spectacular."</p>

<p>It was not exactly kind in Uncle John and Aunt
Betsy&mdash;though they thought it was&mdash;thus to bequeath
their savings to Slyder Downehylle. Their legacy perplexed
him sadly. He discovered, in a very short time,
that money is not in itself&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that
it is generally known as the "one thing needful"&mdash;the
material of happiness. But he was clear in his own mind
that it was something to be got with money. Still, however,
he could not find it&mdash;that "something to be happy
with"&mdash;that cake, that candy, that sugar-ice, that hobby-horse.
When his game was run down, why, it was only
a fox after all.</p>

<p>"Life's an imposition&mdash;a humbug," said Slyder
Downehylle, pettishly; "I've tried much of the fun that's
said to be in it, and I'm beginning to have an idea it's a
confounded stupid piece of business, when a man has
seen it pretty much all through, like a farce at the theatre.
I'm sure I don't know what to be at next. There's
a man to be hung to-morrow; but I've seen two or three

<!-- page 46 -->

fellows hung, and they do it just alike. The fun is soon
got out of that. Then there's to be a fight somewhere
this afternoon; but what's a fight, or a race, or any thing,
in short? A spree is to come off to-night at Crinkumcrankum's;
but I suppose every thing's to travel down
our throats in the old way&mdash;botheration!"</p>

<p>"You should go it," remarked Spifflikens, "go it
strong&mdash;that's the way to scatter the blue devils: go it
strong; and, as the poet judiciously remarks, 'go it while
you're young.' That's the time&mdash;lend me fifty, and I'll
show you a thing or two&mdash;there are several things to be
seen yet, by individuals who don't wear spectacles. This
is good brandy, Slyder&mdash;prime brandy&mdash;where did it
come from? Have you got any more? Brandy's wholesome.
It agrees with almost everybody."</p>

<p>This postulate is not exactly so self-evident as Mr.
Spifflikens thought it to be; but while it is not clearly
proved that brandy agrees with everybody, yet it was
plain enough that Spifflikens agreed with it, and Slyder
Downehylle began likewise to have a slight agreement
with that adjective, both in number and person.</p>

<p>He followed the advice of Spifflikens. No one knew
the world better than Spifflikens, and, therefore, Spifflikens
must, of course, be right,&mdash;so Slyder Downehylle
became convivial. He slept by day and he frolicked by
night. If this was not the long-sought "it," where could
"it" be. Slyder Downehylle was merry&mdash;exceeding
jocose. He was sometimes turned out of three theatres
in one evening:&mdash;he had fought in a ball-room&mdash;had
thrashed several watchmen&mdash;had been honoured with
"private hearings" by the magistracy, and had been,
more than once almost beaten to a jelly. Slyder Downehylle
earned the right and title to be known as a spirited
youth, and so he was, generally. But, by dint of repetition,
the blue began to disappear from this plum also&mdash;the

<!-- page 47 -->

peach was no longer downy. If it had not been for
the peach-brandy, what would have become of Slyder
Downehylle? It was not, indeed, perfect bliss&mdash;Slyder
was subject to headache in the earlier part of the day&mdash;but
it was as nearly "something to be happy with," as
he had yet been enabled to discover.</p>

<p>It was a hard case, view it as you will. Mr. Slyder
Downehylle wanted to be happy&mdash;he had the greatest
disposition to be happy. He had tried every possible experiment
in that direction that either he or Spifflikens
could suggest; but yet he was a dejected man, even
when tipsy twice a day. He could find no delight that
was of a substantial character&mdash;nothing to which he could
constantly recur without fear of disappointment and disgust&mdash;nothing
that would wear all the week through and
be the same to-day, to-morrow, and the day after that.
It was in vain that he intermingled his pleasures&mdash;took
them in alternation&mdash;over-eat himself in the morning and
over-drank himself in the evening, or reversed the process,
turning the bill of fare upside down. It came all
to the same thing in the end. There must be something
wrong&mdash;why could not Slyder Downehylle be happy?
Who laboured harder to boil down common-place and to
extract from it the essence of felicity&mdash;to concentrate the
soup of life, and to elicit essentials from their insipid
dilution?</p>

<p>A man laughed in the play-house&mdash;laughed several
times. What right had he to laugh in that side-shaking
manner? Slyder Downehylle could not laugh&mdash;he saw
no particular joke that required it; but the man laughed
again, and when Slyder requested him not to make a fool
of himself, the man pulled Slyder's nose. Hope deferred
engenders fierceness. Slyder quarrelled with the
man about making so free with another person's nose, as
if it were a bell-pull or a knocker. A nose is not much,

<!-- page 48 -->

to be sure&mdash;many noses are not&mdash;but when a nose is constituted
a point of honour, it expands to the dimensions
of a geographical promontory&mdash;it is peninsular&mdash;it is an
independent territory, over which no one can be allowed to
march, much less to make settlements upon it. Slyder
Downehylle resolved to stand by his nose, and so he
stood up to it, and a duel was the consequence&mdash;a duel,
according to the barbarian custom of modern times, which
was fought before breakfast. Who can be surprised that
there is so much bad shooting extant on these interesting
occasions? A gentleman, no matter how much of a gentleman
he may be in proper hours, cannot reasonably be
expected to be altogether a gentleman&mdash;altogether himself&mdash;at
such an uncivilized time of day. A man may
be valiant enough after nine o'clock&mdash;when he has had
his coffee and muffins&mdash;he may be able to face a battery
in the forenoon, and ready to lead a forlorn hope when he
has dined comfortably; but to ask one to get up to be
shot at, in the gray of the morning&mdash;in the midst of fogs
and all sorts of chilly discomfort, his boots and his trowsers
draggled with dew, and himself unsustained by a
breakfast, why the whole thing is preposterous. No man
can be valiant unless he is warm, and, as no man can be
warm without his breakfast, it is a demonstrated fact that
breakfast is itself valor, and that one may be frightened
before breakfast, without the slightest disparagement to
his character for courage. Master Barnardine was right
when he refused to get up early to go to the gallows.
There is a time for all things. But Slyder Downehylle
was not more alarmed than was natural and proper&mdash;not
more, probably, than his antagonist. "How do they
come on?" said the surgeon to Goliah Bluff, who acted
as Slyder's second. The fourth shot had been interchanged
and no blood drawn. "As well as could be
expected," replied Goliah; "they are approximating&mdash;the

<!-- page 49 -->

seconds don't have to dodge now, and the principals
are not so likely as they were to shoot off their own toes.
Practice makes perfect. Gentlemen, are you ready?&mdash;one,
two, three!"&mdash;bang!&mdash;bang!&mdash;The man had winged
Slyder, and both were glad&mdash;the one that it was safely
over, so far as he was concerned, and the other that the
affair was finished and no worse, so far as he was concerned.
Further approximations might have been dangerous.
But the result was a downright flying in the
face of poetical justice, owing, no doubt, to the fact that
poetical justice wisely lies abed till the last bell rings.
But then, as Goliah Bluff announced to the parties belligerent,
Slyder Downehylle was "satisfied," and who
else had a right to complain? His nose was the feature
most interested, and it said nothing, "as nobody knows
on"&mdash;for it was now a nose which, when regarded in its
metaphysical and honourable aspect, notwithstanding its
rubid tints, had not a stain upon its escutcheon. The
bullet in its master's shoulder had been soapsuds to its
reputation, and the duel had been brickdust to the lustre
of its glory. Slyder Downehylle's nose actually "shone
again," brighter than ever. His arm, indeed, was in a
sling&mdash;the same arm that had conveyed so many slings
into him, to support him, comfort him, and keep him up;
but his nose was self-sustained; it had been proved to be
a feature not to be handled with impunity. But what are
noses, after all&mdash;what are noses in the abstract&mdash;noses individually
considered? Slyder, in the end, did not care
much who pulled his nose, so they did it gently.</p>

<p>He was engaged in solving a great moral problem.
He left the longitude and the squaring of the circle to
intellects of an inferior order. It was for him to determine
whether it was possible to live upon the principal
of one's health and capacities for enjoyment, without
being restricted to such beggarly returns as the mere interest

<!-- page 50 -->

thereof. As for content&mdash;the "being happy with
one's self," as Uncle John expressed it&mdash;this was a very
flat sort of happiness in Slyder Downehylle's estimation,
if, indeed, he ever placed it in that category at all. It
was by no means strong enough for the purpose. Happy
upon water! "I'll trouble you for that pale brandy,"
said Slyder Downehylle. He desired that his existence
should be one vast bowl of champagne punch&mdash;an
everlasting mince-pie&mdash;terrapins and turtle soup&mdash;glaciers
of ice-cream and cataracts of cognac, sunned by
frolic and fanned by the breeze of excitement,&mdash;a "perpetual
spree." There were to be no shady sides of
the way in his resplendent world.&mdash;How many practical
philosophers have failed in the same pursuit! Is the
<i>aurum potabile</i> never to be discovered? Are we always
to come down to the plain reality, at last? Downehylle
could not endure the thought. "More cayenne, if you
please."</p>

<p>"Have you ever tried faro?" whispered Spifflikens;
"there's considerable fun at faro, when you are up
to it."</p>

<p>Spifflikens passed the bottle. Slyder Downehylle had
never tried faro, but he did try it, and thought that he
rather liked it. In short, it improved upon acquaintance.
At length, he had reached the <i>ultima Thule</i>. The "something
to be happy with" had, to all appearance, been
found. Redheiffer was but a goose. He knew not
where to look for the "perpetual motion"&mdash;the everlasting
jog to the flagging spirit. But the top of our speed
brings the end of the race. He who moves most rapidly,
is the soonest at the close of his career. Faro is fickle,
and Slyder Downehylle, in his zeal to pile enjoyment
upon enjoyment&mdash;to be happy, if possible, with several
things at a time&mdash;had unluckily a habit of not taking
even his faro "plain;" he needed syrup also in that effervescing

<!-- page 51 -->

draught, and, as his head became warm, the
"cool" amounts in his pockets melted away.</p>

<p>Slyder Downehylle was a cashless man&mdash;his researches
after felicity had not only proved unsuccessful, but had
left him without the means of future progression. He
was bemired, half-way&mdash;swamped, as it were, in sight
of port. Even Spifflikens cut him dead. The tailors
desired no more of his custom&mdash;his apartments at the
hotel were wanted. The "credit system" was out of
fashion. Financiering had been clipped in its wings.
How doleful looks the candle when capped with an extinguisher!&mdash;The
wounded squirrel drops from limb to
limb. The world has many wounded squirrels, besides
those that crack nuts to earn a living. Just such a
squirrel was Slyder Downehylle, compelled, before he
reached the top of his aspiring hopes, to abandon every
step that he had so toilfully surmounted.</p>

<p>How he now obtained any thing to eat, is not exactly
known. His mode of obtaining something to drink, is,
if not original, certainly ingenious. He never goes to the
pump, having no taste for hydraulics. Nor does he find
water with a hazel twig. He has a more effective "twig"
than that. He lounges in bar-rooms, and, as his old
acquaintances, searchers after happiness not yet brought
up with a "round turn," go there to drink&mdash;a dry
bar is a sad impediment to navigation&mdash;it is astonishing
how very solicitous he becomes in reference to their
health.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Jones? I've not had the pleasure
of seeing you for a long time. How have you
been?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well, Downehylle, pretty well&mdash;but excuse
me&mdash;Bibo and I are going to try something."</p>

<p>"Why, ah&mdash;thank you&mdash;I don't care much if I do join.

<!-- page 52 -->

The pale brandy&mdash;yes&mdash;that will answer," would be Slyder
Downehylle's response under such circumstances,
from which it is apparent that misfortune had somewhat
impaired his sense of hearing.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Slyder Downehylle is supposed to be yet about town,
looking earnestly for his undiscovered happiness. The
last time he was seen by credible witnesses, they noted
him busily employed in playing "All Fours," in front of
John Gin's hostelry&mdash;a game probably selected as emblematic
of his now creeping condition. He lounges no
more in fashionable resorts. Champagne punch is a
mere reminiscence. His Havanas are converted into
"long nines," and his bibulations are at two cents a glass,
making up in piperine pungency what they lack in delicacy
of flavour. He is sadly emaciated, and, in all respects,
considerably the worse for wear, while a hollow
cough indicates that his physical capabilities have proved
inadequate to the requirements of his method of employing
life, and are fast dropping to pieces. Slyder Downehylle
is consequently more melancholy than ever. He is
troubled with doubts. Perhaps he may have proceeded
upon an error&mdash;perhaps the principle, the high pressure
principle, of his action was not the right one. It may be
that excitement is not happiness&mdash;that our pleasures are
fleeting in proportion to their intensity&mdash;that, indeed, if
"life be a feast," the amount of satisfaction to be derived
from it is rather diminished than increased by swallowing
the viands hastily, and by having a free recourse to
condiments, and that a physical economy is as wise and
as necessary to well-being as economy of any other kind.
He is almost led to suppose that his "something to be
happy with" is a fallacy; he never could hold it within

<!-- page 53 -->

his grasp, and he inclines to the belief that a man probably
does well to have a home in himself, that he may not
always be compelled to run abroad for recreation, or to
appeal to his senses to give vivacity to the hour. If it
were his luck to begin again, perhaps he might try the
tack thus indicated. But that hollow cough!&mdash;Our experiences
oft reach their climax too late; yet others may
learn from the example of Slyder Downehylle.</p>

<p>HIGHDAYS AND HOLIDAYS.</p>

<p class="small">A CHRISTMAS FANCY, AND A NEW-YEAR'S THOUGHT.</p>

</div>

<p>UNDOUBTEDLY&mdash;we never meant to deny it&mdash;anniversaries
are pleasant enough, in their way. It is true, perhaps,
that if our wishes could have an effect in the matter,
we might rather desire them not to come quite so
rapidly as they do of late, thus huddling on each other as
if the space between had undergone abridgment, and as
if years, like ourselves, as they grow older, are liable to
shrinkage. There is no audible call for despatch in this
particular, and thus to mount the months upon a locomotive,
to sweep by in such undignified haste that they
are gone almost before we are able to avail ourselves of
their services,&mdash;which every one must have observed to
be peculiarly the case since steam became the fashion and
hurry the order of the day,&mdash;is annoying to people of
leisurely habits, who like to deliberate before they act,
and to consider consequences in advance of the deed,
instead of afterwards, according to modern usages. To
our fancy, the slow year&mdash;the year in hoop, powder and
buckles&mdash;in full decorum and expansion&mdash;was a much
more respectable personage than such years as we have
now; years which have changed the minuet measure of
their ancestors for a hop, step and jump, not to be set
down as otherwise than an abomination. We hate to be
jostled and pushed from our propriety, and though it is
admitted to be true that "here to-day and gone to-morrow"
is symbolical of human existence, this incessant
bustle of preparation causes an absorption of the day in
the morrow. There is no "to-day"&mdash;scarcely the fragment
of an afternoon; nothing but beginnings and endings,
without an intervening pause for thought.</p>

<!-- page 55 -->

<p>Still, however, as you say&mdash;as all the world says&mdash;these
anniversaries are pleasant things; not emphatically
pleasant, but pleasant, with no particular stress upon the
word. They will intrude into our company, you know,
without ceremonious observances. It is not easy to shut
the door in the face of old time, nor is it of avail to reply
"not at home," to the New Year; and, in emergencies
of this kind, when there is no help, we cannot probably
do better than to insist upon it, downright&mdash;to ourselves
and to other people of less importance, that the inevitable
visitant is under our patronage, and has agreeable points
about him. Marvels are to be accomplished in regard
to such convictions, by dint of perseverance. Resolve
upon it that you shall think so, and you will think so,&mdash;sooner
or later. Only want to think so, and the object is
more than half achieved. We are very docile to ourselves,
and in an internal dispute, inclination is so fertile
in argument that it becomes "useless to talk." The fair
lady at last confessed that John Wilkes had a squint&mdash;the
aberration from the true line was too evident to be
denied&mdash;but then, she had prevailed on herself to admire
even his defects, and she qualified her unwilling admission
by declaring that, to her view, "Mr. Wilkes did not
squint more than a gentleman should." And so, these
anniversaries are pleasant things. There is a little of a
sinister expression in their aspect, no doubt&mdash;father Saturn
is charged with a disposition to devour his children&mdash;but
we will set it down as a peculiarity which is rather attractive
than otherwise&mdash;romantic interest, such as that
which envelopes gentlemen of the "suspicious look," who
combine the bully and the beau in so just an equipoise,
that they command success and enforce admiration.</p>

<p>No one pretends to assert, at least, that it is not a
source of pleasure to meet with friends, on a festive occasion&mdash;provided
always that we have friends and possess

<!-- page 56 -->

a fondness for festivities. To give and to receive tokens
of love and amity, affords refreshment to the spirit. The
heart is cheered by smiling faces and the voice of joy,
and it is not to be disputed that dining well is a circumstance
by no means repugnant to the ordinary constitution
of human nature&mdash;not repugnant at the moment, though
sometimes apt to entail remorseful reminiscences. There
is a period also, in our terrestrial career, when the dance
comes not amiss, even if we should chance to feel a little
dull upon it, when the next day's sun peeps in at us; and,
indeed, it may be conceded that all the incidents of the
holiday season and anniversary return&mdash;very nearly all&mdash;are
decidedly pleasant&mdash;bright to anticipate, happy in
fruition, and well enough in the retrospect. Let us, then,
look gayly on the approach of the "happy New Year,"
when we rejoice by tradition, and take up the echo of
old time, that it may reverberate to posterity. Our merry-makings
now, are the connecting link between the past
and the future.</p>

<p>We are told, moreover, that it is not the part of true
wisdom to be strict in the analysis of our pleasures, and
that he is more of a simpleton than a philosopher, who
stops in the midst of his mirth to ascertain, by critical inquiry,
whether, after all, there be any thing to laugh at.
And, in fact, if it is our purpose to extract from life as
many agreeable sensations as it is capable of affording,
we must content ourselves with being entertained, and
not insist too strenuously that the cause shall be in strict
proportion to the effect. Nor can it be regarded as altogether
a matter of sagacity, to pass much time in endeavouring
to discover what we have to be unhappy about
to-day. There are annoyances enough, of the unavoidable
and intrusive sort&mdash;vexations which will, of their own
impulse, be in attendance, independent of a call&mdash;without
a recourse to the muster-roll of grievance, to select a

<!-- page 57 -->

pet sorrow as our special companion. And to search for
a discomfort, merely to bring it in action as a means of
self-disturbance, may be courageous, but it is, for the
most part, an unprofitable exhibition of valour. There is
abundant room for the exercise of the passive virtues,
without this continued practice upon our fortitude.&mdash;Nevertheless,
there are occasions when fevers of this peculiar
type have their advantages; and when, from unknown
causes, be they moral or physical, a diffused
irascibility pervades the individual&mdash;when we go to rest
in gloom and arise in sulkiness&mdash;it is a wholesome operation
that the disorder should be localized, and that some
particular point should be presented, no matter what, on
which the pent-up fury may have vent. For example,
if a gentleman, in the morning, should chance to be overheard
in addressing harsh and uncivil words to his slippers,
and in speaking with unkindness and disrespect to
his boots, those with whom he is likely to come in contact
at subsequent hours, have reason to rejoice that the
superfluous electricity with which he was troubled, has
wreaked itself upon inanimate objects. A living creature
has, in all likelihood, had a fortunate escape. The slipper
anticipates a contention&mdash;a boot may have frustrated
a duel, and deprived surgery of a subject. Should my
lady apostrophize the unlucky broom, which careless
hands have left upon the stair, or should she, in sparkling
monologue, comment on other oversights in housewifery,
which meet her early eye, do not repine at wasted energy,
or at eloquence scattered to the unheeding air. It is a
mercy, though you think it not, and power remains for
all needful purposes. Occurrences of this description are,
however, but exceptions to the comprehensive rule, and
are not to be elevated to the station of a general example.
They are not to be pleaded, certainly, as a justification of

<!-- page 58 -->

undiscriminating cynicism, or as palliating the propensity
to seek for faults and to spy out defects.</p>

<p>But yet, as concerns holidays in general&mdash;as involves
the merits of New Year's days and birth-days in particular&mdash;we
are little disposed to be captious and hypercritical&mdash;but
still it must be acknowledged, with all due
deference to sounder judgment and more enlarged experience,
that when they are regarded apart from their
fineries, and the sophistication is dispensed with&mdash;when
they lay aside hat, cloak and feathers&mdash;the comeliness, as
in other instances not lying under present notice, measurably
disappears, and as they sit down with us quietly
by the fireside, it would be difficult perhaps conscientiously
to assert, that the sensation is that of unmixed
delight, or that the satisfaction would have been much
less had their coming been delayed somewhat&mdash;not from
a dearth of hospitality&mdash;not that we are altogether averse
to this stranger presence; but from a vague impression
that we are not fully prepared for such distinguished company,
and would like to be a little more economical in
joys of this description&mdash;not quite so many birth-days,
and a thought less, if we may so express it, of the New
Year. Let children be impatient&mdash;we can wait well
enough; and though it be an axiom that time is money,
we care not thus to exercise our arithmetic in its computation&mdash;like
Hamlet, we are "ill at these numbers."&mdash;The
observant eye may have noted, too, that with its increase
of chronological wealth, the world grows miserly
in the accumulation of its anniversary amounts&mdash;that it
hides them, as it were, in unnoticed crannies and disregarded
chinks, and that, as the sum grows larger, it
shrinks from every allusion to its doubtful riches, as if
there were robbers here, to "steal our years away."
Nor can it have escaped intelligent remark, that there are
those among us&mdash;respectable people, not incompetent to

<!-- page 59 -->

a gig, if, indeed, they may not justly aspire to a pair of
horses&mdash;persons not to be suspected, under ordinary circumstances,
of a bias towards larceny, who do not scruple
to plunder themselves of their historical position, and who,
since it would be a work beyond their powers to suppress
the First of January outright, nathless do contrive to wink
strangely when the day that gave them birth rolls by, as
if they had forgotten its distinctive features, and felt no
gratitude for the favour it conferred, in the far distant
past.</p>

<p>Since such facts are facts, not to be controverted, how
happens it that at these moments, a really reluctant people
are called upon to rejoice, in assumed jollity and
forced smiles? Is it done to drive away care, or is it,
after all, a joke&mdash;an invocation to merriment and convivialities&mdash;we
address the question to the common sense
of everybody&mdash;is it a joke&mdash;we mean, a very good joke&mdash;a
joke to make us frisk, and give us a spasmodic twinge
in the side&mdash;to peep into the mirror, and to count upon
the cheek and brow, the additional flourishes of Time's
villanously crampt penmanship? We speak not in regard
to connoisseurship or dilletanteism; but are you, in
your heart, fond of the study of these ungraceful hieroglyphics?
Would you not prefer engrossments on other
parchment? A majestic brow is admirable in a statue,&mdash;a
fine phrenology may be a letter of recommendation; but
it is yet to be made manifest that musings upon a wig,
or meditations about the approaching necessity for a
"scratch," ever provoked a smile in him who was compelled
to entertain them. Lear thought it flattery&mdash;but
he was singular in his opinion&mdash;to be told that his beard
was white; and it would perhaps move surprise, if there
were an issue of invitations to celebrate the arrival of
gray hairs. There are methods to create hunger when
the appetite is disposed to sleep; but why it should render

<!-- page 60 -->

us eager for comfits and confections, because another
round has been completed&mdash;because, though the jubilant
be a year older, he is scarce a minute wiser&mdash;nearer the
end of his career, yet not a penny richer&mdash;as full of sin
and folly as before, but with much less time for repentance
and amendment,&mdash;would puzzle Abernethy himself
to explain.&mdash;There is, besides, a sad waste of gunpowder,
and the loud rattle of fire-arms, hereabouts, and it may be
appropriate to let off a blunderbuss as the old year expires.
There are instances, no doubt, in which that
weapon would be characteristic.</p>

<p>Look ye, too, where comes the forgotten tailor, the
neglected hatter, the unsought shoemaker, with a long
line of others who have administered to your convenience&mdash;see
them approach, not perhaps having "fire in
each eye," but certainly with "paper in each hand," to
bring you to a settlement&mdash;a winding up of old affairs,
preliminary to a new onset. Do you find that funny,
friend&mdash;heedless, thoughtless, perhaps cashless, friend?&mdash;Now,
you perceive the moral of the matter&mdash;now, you
obtain a glimpse of the special mission of this holiday;
and the pecuniary settlement to which the time is subject,
is but a type of the more impressive settlement which the
recurrence of the day should impose upon us. If that be
well performed, then, indeed, have we reason to rejoice.</p>

<p>It has struck you often, in moments of calmness and
reflection&mdash;after disappointments and in grief&mdash;in those
minutes when the flush of enjoyment had faded to a
sombre hue, and self-estimation had proportionably subsided&mdash;that
there were changes in your own character and
disposition which might be made to advantage. It would
have been resented, if another had said as much; for you
then thought, and still think, it may be mistakenly, that
these defects are only apparent in full to their owner.
Still, however, the amelioration was resolved upon. At

<!-- page 61 -->

first, it was to begin "now." Then came cares and
pleasures; a little postponement was granted, and this
great work, if we are not in error, lies in the dusty
corners of your determination, quite unfinished. Could
you not take it up to-day?&mdash;A more fitting time is not
likely to present itself.</p>

<p>Somebody has frequently promised&mdash;but, after the
cautious fashion of Sir Giles Overreach, "we name no
parties"&mdash;has promised very distinctly to himself&mdash;and
there is no one with whom it would be more to his advantage
to keep faith&mdash;that the New Year shall find him,
in many respects, a new man. Do you know such a
person&mdash;a friend, a brother, a lover or a husband, who
has done this, in the view of evil habit, of indolence, of
ill temper, of any of the thousands of temptations and of
faults which beset the human family? Strengthen his
will; give encouragement to his weakness. He may
chance to need it.</p>

<p>And then, it may not be too much to assume that, perfect
as we are, there is no want of certain pestilent imps, who
find places in our train, and are ever on the alert for mischief,&mdash;saucy
companions, of whom we would gladly be
rid, but that they take us by surprise, and await not the
chastisements of our regret&mdash;little petulances, which at
times prompt us to wound those who love us best&mdash;small
discontents, which seek expression in embittered words&mdash;unrecognised
envies, which lacerate the heart and disturb
repose, leading to uncharitable thoughts, and unkindly
judgments&mdash;petty jealousies, have we not, rendering
us unreasonable, querulous, and ill at ease? Such
restless spirits swarm the air, causing endless complications
of annoyance. Let them, this day, be summoned
to your footstool, to meet discharge, and, above all things,
let us impress it on your mind to scan their faces closely.
They are adroit at a disguise, and often elude the most

<!-- page 62 -->

careful watch; so that we know them not but in their
effects, and by the sorrows they are apt to leave behind.</p>

<p>If such be our policy, as the substratum of our merriment,
and the undercurrent to our mirth, and if we can
find nerve enough to accomplish but a part of what is
deemed desirable,&mdash;if each New Year is thus assured of
meeting with us so much wiser, and therefore happier&mdash;for
wisdom is but happiness, after all,&mdash;than any of its
predecessors, we shall "better brook the loss of brittle
youth," and meet the onward tide of time with buoyant
hearts and an unshrinking hope&mdash;satisfied with the present,
and with no terrors for the future.</p>

<p>THE NEWS-BOY.</p>

</div>

<p>ARMS have had their day. The age of steel is past.
The thunders of Mont St. Jean formed the grand finale
to the melo-drama of military exploit, and the curtain fell,
never to rise again, upon the last scene of martial greatness,
when the laurelled warriors of France cast aside the
baton of command to have recourse to their spurs. Bellona
then went to boarding-school, and learned to comb
her refractory locks into the pliant graces of the toilet,
while Mars obtained a situation in a counting-house, and
seated upon a three-legged stool, still nibs his pen to gain
a livelihood. Romance expired at Waterloo. Chivalry
expended itself when Ney was foiled; and the Belgian
peasant unconsciously depicts the moral of the fall of
the empire when he boils potatoes in the helmet of the
knight, and cooks his mutton in a breastplate of the
"Guard." The world is tired of slaughter&mdash;the poetry
of the shambles is exhausted. We live as long as we
can now, and find existence none the worse for having a
full supply of arms and legs. A body like a cullender is
not essential to reputation, and death has become so unpopular
that it is only by special favour that ambition can
get itself hanged.</p>

<p>New elements produce new combinations. When the
musket rusts in a garret, and glory puzzles over the multiplication
table and retails brown sugar, the restless impulses
of humanity seek excitements before unknown.
Strategy exhibits itself in the marts of trade. Napoleons
are financiers. The sun of Austerlitz bursts through the
clouds which overhang the stock exchange. Bulls and
bears constitute the contending hosts of modern times,

<!-- page 64 -->

and there is no analogy to the "maraud," unless we find
it in embezzlement and defalcation. We are "smart"
now&mdash;exceeding smart, and pugnacity is thrown to the
dogs. Learning, too, leaves its solidity in the cloister,
and, no longer frighted by trumpets and sulphurous vapors,
spreads itself thinly abroad. Being in haste, the
world reads as it runs, so that heavy books, like heavy
artillery, remain in the arsenals. Man, commercial man,
speculating man, financial man&mdash;man, heedless of gory
greatness, but eager for cash, must know all that is in
agitation. Having ceased to kill his neighbour, he is
anxious to ascertain what his neighbour is about, that he
may turn him and his doings to profitable account; and
hence, in the place of those gaudy banners which used to
flout the sky, instead of the oriflamme of nations, which
once rallied their battalia, we gather round the newspaper,
not with sword, and shield, and casque, but with ink-stained
jacket and with pen in ear. Our clarion now,
more potent than the Fontarabian horn, is the shrill voice
of the news-boy, that modern Minerva, who leaped full
blown from the o'erfraught head of journalism; and, as the
news-boy is in some respects the type of the time&mdash;an incarnation
of the spirit of the day,&mdash;a few words devoted
to his consideration may not be deemed amiss.</p>

<p>As the true Corinthian metal was formed from the
meltings of the devoted city, thus the news-boy is the
product of the exigencies of the era. The requirements
of the age always bring forth that which is wanted. The
dragon teeth of tyranny have often caused the earth to
crop with armed men, and the nineteenth century, thirsting
for information and excitement, finds its Ganymede
in the news-boy. He is its walking idea, its symbol, its
personification. Humanity, in its new shape, is yet young
and full of undefined energies, and so is he. The first
generation of his race not having outgrown their business,

<!-- page 65 -->

the important part which youth thus trained, is destined
to play in human affairs, is as yet too imperfectly developed
even for the meditations of the most speculative
philosopher that ever extracted glowing sunbeams from
the refreshing cucumber; but, as nature does nothing in
vain, it is fair to infer that the news-boy is destined,
in one way or another, to fix the period which gave him
birth, in the niche of history. Too many powerful elements
combine in him not to be productive of grand results.
What is the news-boy&mdash;what is necessary to his
original constitution&mdash;what faculties are involved, cherished,
strengthened and made, as it were, the preponderating
forces of his character, by the calling to which
he is devoted? Survey the news-boy&mdash;extract him from
the buzzing crowd and place him on a pedestal, while
you analyze his character in its psychological and physical
details, estimating, at the same time, the past and
future operation of circumstances in educating him for
mature effort in the contentions of men. Anatomize him,
and "see what breeds about his heart." A rough study,
truly&mdash;soiled garments and patches. The youth is not
precisely fitted for presentation in the drawing-room, evident
though it be that his self-possession would not desert
him in the presence of an empress. Valets and body
servants do not trouble themselves about him. Father
and mother, brother and sister, if such there be, have
enough to do in struggling for their own existence, without
attending to the details of his costume, and many a
repair is the result of his own handiwork in hours stolen
from needful rest. That battered hat, grown foxy by exposure,
is picturesque in its proportions, not so much
from careless usage as from hard service, and those oxhide
boots, embrowned and cracked, have shamed the
feats of plank-walking pedestrians. Sooth to say, our
hero is somewhat uncouth in his externals. That fair

<!-- page 66 -->

damsel there would scarcely covet him for a parlour pet.
He would not shine amid carpet knights, nor would Titania
weary Oberon with prayers to have him for her
henchman. The news-boy would not weep either, if he
were to know that perfumed pride and silken delicacy
thus curl the nose at him; for he would be lost and wearied
in such preferment. Observe his frame, so light,
yet so strong;&mdash;so pliant, wiry and enduring. No
"debile wretch" enters the ranks of these juvenile Pr&aelig;torians;
or, if he should venture on services so far beyond
his capacity, exhaustion soon removes him. Glance at
the expression of that weather-beaten face, prematurely
channelled into line and hardened into muscle. Care,
courage and resolution are in every curve of those compacted
lips. The soft roundness of childhood has departed
long since. That mouth knows more of the strong
word, the keen retort, the well-weighed phrases of the
bargainer, of cunning solicitation, and of the fierce
wrangle, than of the endearing kisses of affection. It
brings no memory of rosebuds. It is no poetic feature
for romance to dwell upon, but a mouth of plain reality&mdash;of
confirmed utilitarianism. It wreathes itself more
readily into the mould of worldly intrepidity, than into the
gentle dimples of early life. It is, in the news-boy, as in
all mankind beside, a key to the individual mysteries of
our nature. The impulses, the ruling trait, are here developed,
and the news-boy offers no exception to the rule.
The glance of his eye is as cold, but as bright, as the
beaming sun of a frosty morning, which sparkles on the
ice, but melts it not. Still, though self-interest and sordid
calculation dwell in its depths, we find a laughing devil
there, which feasts on satire and sports like the chevaliers
of old, <i>&agrave; l'outrance</i>. Its jokes bite shrewdly, and the
lance of its wit displays the point "unbated," though not
"envenomed." When the news-boy turns awhile from

<!-- page 67 -->

business to the pleasures of companionship, he asks no
quiet recreation. His raillery and his pleasant tricks
both deal in heavy blows and rude interchanges. Your
nice, nervous sensibility finds no quarter from one whose
very existence in all its phases is roughness. Should he
hereafter learn to woo, it will be "as the lion wooes his
bride."</p>

<p>Such is the <i>physique</i> of the news-boy, and it contains
many of the constituent points of greatness. Tossed early
into the world, the impediments which cause other men
to fail, are soon surmounted in his path. He has no
kindly arm to lean upon, and, through mistaken tenderness,
to make his steps unsteady. He is his own staff&mdash;his
own protector. Of diffidence, he never heard the
name&mdash;he does not know its nature. Imaginary barriers
cannot interpose between him and his object; for he recognises
none as worthier than he, and self-distrust plays
no fantastic tricks to defeat the consummation of what he
may resolve. He lives in deeds, and not in dreamy
speculation&mdash;he is an actor, not a looker on, and practice
has given him that estimate of his own powers which
rarely falls below the mark, and which, best of all, surrounds
disappointment with no unreal terrors. When he
falls, he falls but to rise again with renewed strength, like
the fabled Ant&aelig;us. And while continued collision with
the world thus hardens his intellectual being, his muscular
energies, which sustain the spirit, receive a training
of proportionate severity. He has no tender years. Let
wealthy youth be housed in luxury, and guarded from the
storm. Soft couches and protracted slumbers do not
enervate the news-boy. Compared to him, the sun itself
is a sluggard. No morning ray finds him in bed; the
moon and stars witness his uprisings, and he travels forth
in darkness to commence his daily toil. Let the rain fall
in torrents&mdash;the lightning flash&mdash;the thunders roar, the

<!-- page 68 -->

news-boy laughs at the elemental strife. Heat and cold
are alike indifferent to one who has such duties to perform.
It is on him that society waits for its mental aliment,
and can he falter&mdash;can he shrink before winds and
showers, before frosts and heats, who, more truly than
any human being, is the "schoolmaster abroad?" No&mdash;others
may crouch around the fire, or shrink beneath their
blankets, at the sound of winter's threatening blasts; but
the news-boy springs up, whistling cheerily, to encounter
any hardship that may oppose him.</p>

<p>Now, it is contended that whole masses and classes of
youth, thus educated, thus trained&mdash;who live, as it were,
by their wits&mdash;by their boldness, their address, their perseverance&mdash;whose
faculties are always literally at the
grindstone&mdash;who daily practise endurance, fortitude, self-restraint,
abstinence, and many other virtues; who are
pre-eminently frugal and industrious; who learn to understand
men and boys, dandies and dandizettes, and are
schooled to emulation and competition&mdash;must of necessity
produce something&mdash;not a little of roguery, mayhap,
which is often the fungous growth, the untrimmed shoot,
of a certain grade of cleverness. But we look for more
than this&mdash;if genius is ever latent, the life of the news-boy
must bring it forth. The blows which fall on him,
would elicit sparks from the flint. In the school which
boasts of such a pupil, society is the book, adversity the
teacher, and harsh circumstance plays the part of rod
and ferula. He is scourged into wisdom, almost before
others can walk alone.</p>

<p>In what peculiar way, Tom Tibbs, whose admirable
portrait graces our present number, is likely to distinguish
himself, remains to be seen. His faculties are expansive
&mdash;roaming like summer bees. The moment of concentration,
when genius, rallying upon its focus, burns its way
through all impediments, has not yet come to him. But

<!-- page 69 -->

Tibbs is one of whom expectation may be entertained.
In fact, he has long been spoken of as a "hopeful youth,"
by many of those who know him; and though the phrase
may often be applied derisively, as a sort of <i>lucus a non
lacendo</i>, still this is but the vulgar error, which cannot
comprehend the kittenhood of lionism&mdash;the unappreciated
infancy of power. No one ever achieved distinction who
did not begin by being a nuisance, just as greatness in a
single walk, of necessity constitutes a bore; and it may
be so with Tibbs. He has already learned the one great
lesson of success. He looks upon the community as a
collective trout&mdash;a universal fish, which must nibble at
his bait, lie in his basket, and fill his frying-pan. On this
maxim, heroes have overrun the world. It has been the
foundation, not only of fortunes, but of empires. Why
should it not elevate Tibbs? Especially as his soul has
not been whittled down to a single point, by the process
of acquiring the knowledge to which we refer. Tibbs
has the affections, the sympathies, the twining tendrils of
the heart, in as great perfection as can be expected in
one who has been taught to look upon downright fact as
the great purpose of existence. The pennies, however,
do not engross him utterly; but when he is in pursuit of
the pennies, that pursuit is made paramount. He takes
his business as Falstaff did his sack, "simple, of itself;"
and his pleasures are imbibed "neat," never spoiling
both by an infusion and admixture of either. That soldier
is a poor sentinel who nods upon his post, and would
both watch and wink upon a tour of duty. The winkings
of Tibbs are wisely condensed into a continuous
slumber; and when he watches, it is generally found that
his eyes are quite as widely open as the eyes of other
people.</p>

<p>Tom Tibbs had a father, a necessity from which it is
believed the greatest are not exempt, and in Tom's case,

<!-- page 70 -->

as indeed in many others, it was a hard necessity, from
which it would have pleased him to be excused. Tom's
father was a disciplinarian&mdash;that is, he compounded for
his own delinquencies by a compensatory severity upon
the delinquencies of others. When he had made a fool
of himself abroad, he balanced the account and atoned
for the folly, by chastising Tom at home, and thus went
to bed with a cleared conscience and a weary arm. When
he had spent more money upon a recreation than precisely
suited his circumstances, the family were put upon short
commons, and Tom's contingent of shoes and jackets, as
well as those of his brothers and sisters&mdash;for he is not
the only scion of Tibbsism&mdash;was economically retrenched.
The elder Tibbs piqued himself much upon his paternal
kindness in teaching prudence to his offspring. "You'll
bless me for it," said he, with tears in his eyes, as he
prepared to hammer them all round, after having been
fined for wheeling his barrow upon the pavement,
"you'll bless me for it the longest day you have to
live." The elder Tibbs was patriarchal&mdash;he made the
law as the necessity arose, carrying it into effect himself,
and its adaptation to circumstances was wonderful.
Any trouble in solving the equity of the case was instantly
obviated by flogging Tom, and then old Tibbs would
exclaim, "My conscience is easy&mdash;I do my best towards
these naughty children&mdash;my duty is fulfilled&mdash;if they
come to bad ends, they can't blame me for it. I have
spared no pains to bring 'em up properly," and he had
not been sparing, so far as the strap was concerned.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tibbs was a tender-hearted woman, who did not
exactly understand parental duties as they were received
by her husband; yet, being somewhat overcrowed by the
commanding spirit of her mate, she sometimes almost
began to think that Tom must indeed be rather a bad boy
to require the neat's leather so often. But Mrs. Tibbs

<!-- page 71 -->

loved her children, and did her best to console them,
thus preserving a verdant spot in Tom's otherwise arid
heart; for, as his cuticle was hardened, his spirit also grew
callous.</p>

<p>The pressure of the times, however, at last compelled
the Tibbs family to migrate westward; and the father,
when two days out from the city, having become warm
with his own eloquence upon the difficulties of making a
living, called Tom to his side and diverged into a personal
episode and an individual apostrophe:</p>

<p>"It's so hard now to get along in the world, that I
shouldn't wonder, if any thing happened to me, if these
children were to starve. Tom, Tom, how often have I
told you that you'd never come to good! Tom, Tom!
you'll break my heart! Where's that strap? I don't
want to do it, but I must!"</p>

<p>Tom, however, could not be prevailed upon to "stay
to supper," and escaped, retracing his steps to the city,
and dissolving all connection with the strap. He thought
that he had received quite as much "bringing up," in
that respect, as was necessary.</p>

<p>Tom felt his destiny strong within him. He threw
himself into the bosom of the news-boys, and through
their kindness, for they are a kindly race when properly
approached, soon became one of the most distinguished
of the corps. No one can sell more adroitly than he; his
perseverance is mingled with tact, and his verbal embellishments
as to the peculiar interest of the number
of the journal he has to sell, are founded on fact. He
never announces the steamer to be in before she is
telegraphed, nor indulges in the false pretences which
so often derogate from the dignity of the profession.
He estimates its importance, and proceeds upon principle.
The traveller who trades with Tibbs, at the cars, or on
board the steamboat, may safely buy under the ringing of

<!-- page 72 -->

the last bell, without finding too late that his pennies have
been exchanged for newspapers stale as an addled egg,
and freshly pumped on, to give them an appearance of
juvenility. Nor does Tom ever avail himself of hasty departures,
to be oblivious in the matter of returning change.
He does not, under such circumstances, "as some ungracious
pastors do," put your quarter in one pocket and
fumble for sixpences in the other, until the train darts
away; nor would he, if tempted to the performance of
this unworthy feat, add insult to injury, by holding up the
cash when distance had made its reception impossible, or
by assuming that burlesque expression of hypocritical
astonishment with which some paper-venders, in a similar
catastrophe, outrage your feelings besides wronging
your purse. As Tom often justly remarks to such of his
colleagues as are habituated to these practices, "This
'ere chiselling system won't do. Nobody likes to be
chiselled, and when you have chiselled everybody, why
then they'll get a law passed, and chisel us all to chips. A
joke to-day is often a licking to-morrow, mind I tell you."</p>

<p>Tom's philosophy was, at once, Franklinian and indisputable.
He felt the necessity of obviating all danger of
a war of races. He knew that nothing but mischief was
to be anticipated, if all the rest of the human family were
to be "chiselled" into a hostility against the news-boys;
for the minority always stand in the predicament of being
presented and suppressed as a nuisance, whenever the
stronger party think fit to exercise the power of numbers;
and, as a natural consequence, Tom was opposed to the
practice of clustering about a corner and selling newspapers
in a flock. "A sprinkling of news-boys, one or
two in every square," thought he, "is well enough. It's
good for trade, and makes things lively; but to be cutting
up, so fashion, all in a jam, why people go on t'other
side of the way, and retailing's done for. I vote for

<!-- page 73 -->

scatteration. Folks hate being obligated to fight their
way through the literary circles."</p>

<p>But Tibbs, with all his good sense, has a weakness.
There is a forte and a foible to every blade, and even
such a blade as a news-boy cannot escape the common
lot of humanity. Sound upon the general principle of
not annoying others, yet, in the indulgence of his humour,
he sometimes makes an exception. He especially dislikes
Mr. Sappington Sapid, a starched gentleman of the
old school, who never reads a journal, cares nothing for
the current of events, and entertains a perfect horror of
the modern style of newspapers and of all concerned in
their distribution. In fact, he attributes much of the
evils of the time to cheap journalism, and he has
not been sparing of an expression of his views on the
subject, whenever the opportunity was afforded. On
some one of these occasions, it was his luck to wound
the feelings of Thomas Tibbs, and Tibbs accordingly
marked him for a sufferer.</p>

<p>Incessantly was Mr. Sappington Sapid assailed. Not a
news-boy passed his door without ringing the bell to ascertain
whether a paper was not required&mdash;he never walked
the streets without perpetual and ridiculous solicitations.
When he appeared, all customers were left for his special
annoyance, and, in consequence of failing in the attaint
one day, when he directed an indignant kick at the provoking
Tibbs&mdash;unpractised individuals should never
essay the rapid and extemporaneous application of the
foot&mdash;Mr. Sappington Sapid sat suddenly and unexpectedly
down in a puddle of water, in full sight of a legion
of his tormentors, who never forgot the incident, but
would rehearse it, to the delight of their fellows, whenever
the unfortunate man happened to present himself,
and Tibbs was especially dexterous in giving the broadest
effect to the incident.</p>

<!-- page 74 -->

<p>What a vitality there is in our worst mishaps! It
would be nothing, comparatively, if disaster were circumscribed
by its immediate consequences, and it would have
made but little figure in Mr. Sapid's memoirs had he only
caught cold by the operation referred to; but when a personal
sorrow is transmuted into a general joke, it becomes,
<i>ipso facto</i>, a living piece of attendant biography, a walking
companionship, which even smiles over a man's last resting-place.
Death itself affords no refuge to the hero of a
"ridicule." "Poor fellow!" say his dearest friends,
"perhaps it's wrong to mention it now, but, by-the-way,
did you ever hear how,&mdash;ha! ha! ho!&mdash;how he made
such a fool of himself at Mrs. Dunover's pic-nic? Ho!
ho! ha! Poor soul!!"</p>

<p>Rob a church, or lay logs on the rail-road, and there is
a chance that the last may be heard of it; but if a drollery,
no matter how sad in its essence, be created at any one's
expense, he and it are so far married that they cling together
through life, while the jest is a "relict," to move
<i>post mortem</i> mirth, autopsical grins and necrological merriment.
A dear departed is much more likely to be resurrectionised
by a surviving joke, than by the most intrepid
of body-snatchers, and the best of portraits is not so good
a memento as being implicated in an anecdote which is
sure to create laughter. Under an inkling of this truth,
Mr. Sapid always denies that he is the person who
"shook his foot" at the news-boys.</p>

<p>But there are bounds to patience. A man is but a
bottle before the fire of mischance, and when the heat
becomes insupportable, he must of necessity explode, no
matter how tightly corked by fortitude, or wired down by
philosophy. "The grief that will not speak," is a deadly
inward fermentation. They who survive sorrow, are those
who "exteriorize" sorrow, and give sorrow a free channel.
To scold is the vital principle of practical hygiene for the

<!-- page 75 -->

ladies, and grumbling humanity rarely needs the doctor.
The inference therefore is, that the average of existence
would be at a higher rate, if the admirable counter-irritant
of round swearing were not proscribed in refined society,
thus killing people by the suppressed perspiration of an
indignant spirit.</p>

<p>Sapid, however, was none of these. Patience might
sit upon a monument, if she liked; but there was nothing
of the marble-mason in his composition, nor did he at all
affect the "statuesque," when vexation chafed his heart.
If preyed upon in this way, though he never indulged in
Commodore Trunnion's expletives, nor "shotted his discourse"
like that worthy commander, yet he did not, by
any means, pray in return, as Dinah had often reason to
acknowledge, when the chamber pitcher was left vacant
of water, or when forgetful Boots failed in the performance
of his resplendent office. No! Sappington Sapid
makes people hear of it when he is offended, justly thinking
it better that their ears should be annoyed, than that
he should pine away of an unexpressed inflammation.</p>

<p>It was a bright forenoon, such as elicits snakes in the
country, and evolves the fashionable in cities, when Mr.
Sappington Sapid walked firmly along the street, filled
with a settled purpose. His coat was buttoned up to the
chin, to prevent the evaporation of his stern resolve; his
lips were drawn together, as if to obviate all danger of
evasion by word of mouth; his hat had settled martially
down almost to the bridge of his nose, while his heels
saluted mother earth so determinedly, that his whole
frame-work jarred at the shock. If ever a man displayed
outward symptoms of having his mind made up into the
most compact kind of a parcel, it was Sappington Sapid,
on this memorable occasion. No beggar would have
dared to ask charity from him, under such an aspect. He
was safe from being solicited to take a cab. They who

<!-- page 76 -->

met him, made way instinctively. "Under him, their
genius was rebuked; as, it is said, Mark Antony's was
by C&aelig;sar;" a psychological phenomenon often manifest,
when, by the force of an emergency, even inferior men
are screwed up to the sublime,&mdash;just as valour's self
shrinks abashed from the angry presence of a cornered cat.</p>

<p>But whither wandered Sapid? No one knew. He
had taken breakfast without a word, and had wandered
forth in equal silence. Counsel he sought not&mdash;sympathy
he did not require. When we are girded up, of
our own impulse, to pull the trigger of a catastrophe, advice
is felt to be an impertinence, and no spur is needed
to prick the sides of our intent. We are a sufficiency
unto ourselves. Legions could not make us stronger,
and, therefore, Sapid disdained companionship or an interchange
of thought. He, Sapid, was enough to fill the
canvas for the contemplated picture. He was the
tableau, all alone, so far as his share in the incident was
to be concerned.</p>

<p>Some clue to his state of mind may be afforded, when
it is known that he was visited by a night-mare, a journalistic
incubus, on the previous night. An immense
Tom Tibbs sat upon his breast, and tried to feed him
with penny papers. His head seemed to grow to the
size of a huge type-foundery, and each of his ears roared
like a power press. Then again, he was flattened into
an immense sheet, and they printed him as a "Double
Brother Jonathan," with pictorial embellishments. He
was expanded into whole acres of reading for the people,
and did not awake until he was folded, pasted up, and
thrust into the mail-bag; when, protesting against the
ignominy of being charged "at the usual rate of newspaper
postage," he sprang up convulsively, and found that
his night-cap had got over his nose.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 77 -->

<p>"Is this the office of the 'National Pop-gun and Universal
Valve Trumpet?' " inquired Sapid, in sepulchral tones.</p>

<p>"Hey&mdash;what? Oh!&mdash;yes," gruffly replied the clerk, as
he scrutinized the applicant.</p>

<p>"It is, is it?" was the response.</p>

<p>"H-umpse;" being a porcine affirmative, much in use
in the city of brotherly love.</p>

<p>"I am here to see the editor, on business of importance,"
slowly and solemnly articulated Sapid.</p>

<p>There must have been something professionally alarming
in this announcement, if an opinion may be formed
from the effect it produced.</p>

<p>"Editor's not come down yet, is he, Spry?" inquired
the clerk, with a cautionary wink at the paste-boy.</p>

<p>"Guess he ain't more nor up yet," said Spry; "the
mails was late, last night."</p>

<p>"I'll take a seat till he does come," observed Sapid,
gloomily.</p>

<p>Spry and the clerk laid their heads together, in the
most distant corner of the little office.<p>

<p>"Has he got a stick?" whispered one.</p>

<p>"No, and he isn't remarkable big, nuther."</p>

<p>"Any bit of paper in his hand&mdash;does he look like State
House and a libel suit? It's a'most time&mdash;not had a new
suit for a week."</p>

<p>"Not much; and, as we didn't have any scrouger in
the 'Gun' yesterday, perhaps he wants to have somebody
tickled up himself. Send him in."</p>

<p>St. Sebastian Sockdolager, Esq., the editor of "The
National Pop-gun and Universal Valve Trumpet," sat at
a green table, elucidating an idea by the aid of a steel pen
and whitey-brown paper, and, therefore, St. Sebastian
Sockdolager did not look up when Mr. Sapid entered the
sanctum. The abstraction may, perhaps, have been a
sample of literary stage effect; but it is certain that the

<!-- page 78 -->

pen pursued the idea with the speed and directness of a
steeple-chase, straight across the paper, and direful was
the scratching thereof. The luckless idea being at last
fairly run down and its brush cut off, Mr. Sockdolager
threw himself back in his chair, with a smile of triumph.</p>

<p>"Tickletoby!" said he, rumpling his hair into heroic
expansiveness.</p>

<p>"What?" exclaimed Sapid, rather nervously.</p>

<p>"My dear sir, I didn't see you&mdash;a thousand pardons!
Pray, what can be done for you in our line?"</p>

<p>"Sir, there is a nuisance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Glad of it, sir; the 'Gun' is death on a nuisance.
We circulate ten thousand deaths to any sort of a nuisance
every day, besides the weekly and the country edition.
We are a regular smash-pipes in that line&mdash;surgical,
surgical to this community&mdash;we are at once the knife and
the sarsaparilla to human ills, whether financial, political
or social."</p>

<p>"Sir, the nuisance I complain of, lies in the circulation&mdash;in
its mode and manner."</p>

<p>"Bless me!" said Sockdolager, with a look of suspicion;
"you are too literal in your interpretations. If
your circulation is deranged, you had better try Brandreth,
or the Fluid Extract of Quizembob."</p>

<p>"It is not my circulation, but yours, which makes all
the trouble. I never circulate,&mdash;I can't without being
insulted."</p>

<p>"Really, mister, I can't say that this is clearly comprehensible
to perception. Not circulate! Are you below
par in the 'money article,' or in what particular do
you find yourself in the condition of being 'no go'? Excuse
my faceti&aelig; and be brief, for thought comes tumbling,
bumping, booming" and Sockdolager dipped
his pen in the ink.</p>

<p>Mr. Sappington Sapid unravelled the web of his miseries.

<!-- page 79 -->

"I wish you, sir, to control your boys&mdash;to dismiss
the saucy, and to write an article which shall make 'em
ashamed of themselves. I shall call on every editor in
the city, sir, and ask the same&mdash;a combined expression
for the suppression of iniquity. We must be emancipated
from this new and growing evil, or our liberties
become a farce, and we are squushed and crushed in a
way worse than fifty tea-taxes."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Mr. Whatcheecallem; it can't be done&mdash;it
would be suicidal, with the sharpest kind of a knife.
Whatcheecallem, you don't understand the grand movement
of the nineteenth century&mdash;you are not up to snuff
as to the vital principle of human progression&mdash;the propulsive
force has not yet been demonstrated to your benighted
optics. The sun is up, sir; the hill-tops of intellect
glow with its brightness, and even the level plain
of the world's collective mediocrity is gilded by its beams;
but you, sir, are yet in the foggy valley of exploded prejudice,
poking along with a tuppenny-ha'penny candle&mdash;a
mere dip. Suppress sauciness! Why, my dear bungletonian,
sauciness is the discovery of the age&mdash;the secret
of advancement! We are saucy now, sir, not by the
accident of constitution&mdash;temperament has nothing to do
with it. We are saucy by calculation, by intention, by
design. It is cultivated, like our whiskers, as a superadded
energy to our other gifts. Without sauciness,
what is a news-boy? what is an editor? what are revolutions?
what are people? Sauce is power, sauce is spirit,
independence, victory, every thing. It is, in fact,&mdash;this
sauce, or 'sass,' as the vulgar have it&mdash;steam to the great
locomotive of affairs. Suppress, indeed! No, sir; you
should regard it as part of your duty as a philanthropist
and as a patriot, to encourage this essence of superiority
in all your countrymen; and I've a great mind to
write you an article on that subject, instead of the

<!-- page 80 -->

other, for this conversation has warmed up my ideas so
completely, that justice will not be done to the community
till they, like you, are enlightened on this important
point."</p>

<p>St. Sebastian Sockdolager, now having a leading
article for "The National Pop-gun and Universal Valve
Trumpet," clearly in his mind, was not a creature to be
trifled with. An editor in this paroxysm, however gentle
in his less inspired moments, cannot safely be crossed,
or even spoken to. It is not wise to call him to dinner,
except through the keyhole, and to ask for "more copy,"
in general a privileged demand, is a risk too fearful to be
encountered. St. Sebastian's eye became fixed, his brow
corrugated, his mouth intellectually ajar.</p>

<p>"But, sir, the nuisance"&mdash;said Sappington.</p>

<p>"Don't bother!" was the impatient reply, and the
brow of St. Sebastian Sockdolager grew black as his
own ink.</p>

<p>"The boys, sir, the boys!&mdash;am I to be worried out of
my life and soul?"</p>

<p>The right hand of St. Sebastian Sockdolager fell heavily
upon the huge pewter inkstand&mdash;the concatenation of
his ideas had been broken&mdash;he half raised himself from
his chair and glanced significantly from his visiter to the
door.</p>

<p>"Mizzle!" said he, in a hoarse, suppressed whisper.</p>

<p>The language itself was unintelligible&mdash;the word might
have been Chaldaic, for all that Sapid knew to the contrary;
but there are situations in which an interpreter is
not needed, and this appeared to be one of them. Sapid
never before made a movement so swiftly extemporaneous.</p>

<p>He intends shortly to try whether the Grand Jury is a
convert to the new doctrine of sauciness.</p>

<!-- page 81 -->

<p>Tibbs, in the meantime, grows in means and expands
in ambition. Progress is in his soul, like a reel in a bottle.
He aspires already to a "literary agency," and often
feels as if he were destined to publish more magazines at
a single swoop than there are now in existence, each of
which shall have upon its cover, a picture of "The News-Boy,"
while the same device shall gleam upon the panels
of his coach.</p>

<p>GOSSIP ABOUT GOSSIPING.</p>

<p class="small">WITH HINTS ON CONVERSATION.</p>

</div>

<p>IT is a matter both theoretical and practical in our philosophy,
(and we are reckless enough not to care who
knows it, either,) that, next to lounging at a front window
when the weather's sunny, to see the world from a safe
and luxurious ambushment, there are few among human
pleasures at once so cheap, so agreeable, and so enduring
as that slipshod and unpretending delight of the leisure
hour, stigmatized by ignorant incapacity under the reproachful
name of "gossip." We are not, however,
about to trouble ourselves to prove the correctness of the
assertion. There are cases wherein the logical demonstration
is an impertinence. If a truth, in matters of feeling,
come not home to us at the instant of its enunciation,
why, our perceptions are defective&mdash;our experiences incomplete.
We have not been educated and finished up
to that point. It may be, indeed, that we are not calculated
to attain it, even with opportunities the most favourable
to this species of advancement; and it is not in the
nature of words to change the quality of the material of
which we are composed, or to anticipate the results of
that practical schooling which chisels away the block to
bring out the man. In the profundities of wisdom, you
and I learn nothing from each other. Argument and
demonstration are wasted, unless there be that within,
which, to some extent at least, has experimentally proved
the soundness of the doctrine. To be convinced, is but
to recognise a conclusion towards which our imperfect
intelligence had previously been tending; and hence it is
that the treatise on morals is so often an encumbrance to

<!-- page 83 -->

the shelf. It addresses itself to those who are not sufficiently
ripened by trial and observation, to be gathered up
in the harvest of the ethical essayist. Available knowledge,
in the main conduct of life, is a precious ore, to
be, with toils and strugglings, mined out by personal
effort. It is not enough that myriads have passed through
the same process, and have devised to us their experiences
as a legacy. We are only satisfied when, like the child,
our own little hand has established the fact that fire will
burn. We are sure of it then, and govern ourselves accordingly;
but the mere <i>dictum</i> of mamma and all the
warning voices of the nursery, could not otherwise have
impressed it upon us that the lighted taper is an uncomfortable
plaything, as dangerous as it is brilliant. Can
vanity be soothed into an unassuming temper before its
inordinate appetites have caused it to falter, enfeebled by
the very food on which it grew? Is vaulting ambition
to be checked, think you, by the uplifted finger of precept?
Are we to be deterred by "wise saws and modern
instances," until we have felt it stinging in our inmost
soul, be it by success, or be it by disappointment,
that unregulated impulses and morbid cravings lead to
satiety and to the sickness of the heart? So, the time
may be long or short, before we turn with weariness from
the champagne exhilarations of existence, to find health
and comfort in its cooling springs; but, if we are capable
of wisdom, that time must come; and happy they, who,
through many stumblings, by much groping in thick
darkness, with painful bruises and in sad tribulation, have
reached the broad refreshing daylight of this conviction.
Let them not regret the years that have been consumed.
The remnant is the leaf of the sybil, its value enhanced
by the antecedent destruction. Weep not over the afflictions
that have been encountered in threading the labyrinths
of passionate delusion. A prize has been gained

<!-- page 84 -->

worth all its cost; and we have now taken the first degree
in the great university of human training.</p>

<p>All our refinements, in the end, resolve themselves into
nothing more than an unpretending simplicity; for simplicity
is itself the highest of refinements. Your "frogged"
coat and your embroidered vest are indications from the
circus and the theatre. Rings and jewels and <i>bijouterie</i>,
though they may clink and sparkle innocently enough, do
still suggest ideas of the faro-table and a predatory life;
while gaudiness and assumption give rise to an inference
that we are making the first attempt in a position above
our habitude. The true voluptuary, he who regards pleasure
as a science and would derive from existence all the
delight it is capable of yielding, is economical in his enjoyments,
and shuns the debauch as a serpent in the path.
Ignorance may feed fat at its evening meal; but he who
takes things in their connection, as if they were links in
a continuous chain, looks beyond the hour, and is content
with tea and toast; sweet sleep and a clear head on
the morrow being essential items in his calculation.
Whatever be the line of our travel and the nature of our
experiences, we arrive at simplicity at last, if we are so
fortunate as to survive the exploration; and those who
have outlived this arduous task, which cannot be performed
by proxy, and which is a conscription admitting
of no substitute, will agree with us that gossip, goodly
gossip, though sneered at by the immature, is, after all,
the best of our entertainments. With no disparagement
to the relish of professional pursuits&mdash;without invidiousness
towards the ball-room, the dramatic temple, the concert,
the opera or the lecture, we must fall back upon the
light web of conversation, upon chit-chat, upon gossip,
an thou wilt have it so, as our mainstay and our chief reliance&mdash;as
that <i>corps de reserve</i> on which our scattered
and wearied forces are to rally.</p>

<!-- page 85 -->

<p>What is there which will bear comparison as a recreating
means, with the free and unstudied interchange of
thought, of knowledge, of impression about men and
things, and all that varied medley of fact, criticism and
conclusion so continually fermenting in the active brain?
Be fearful of those who love it not, and banish such as
would imbibe its delights, yet bring no contribution to the
common stock. There are men who seek the reputation
of wisdom by dint of never affording a glimpse of their
capabilities, and impose upon the world by silent gravity&mdash;negative
philosophers, who never commit themselves
beyond the utterance of a self-evident proposition, or
hazard their position by a feat of greater boldness than is
to be found in the avowal of the safe truth which has been
granted for a thousand years. There is a deception here,
which should never be submitted to. Sagacity may be
manifest in the nod of Burleigh's head; but it does not
follow that all who nod are Burleighs. He who habitually
says nothing, must be content if he be regarded as
having nothing to say, and it is only a lack of grace on
his part which precludes the confession. In this broad
"Vienna" of human effort, the mere "looker-on" cannot
be tolerated. It is not to be endured that any one should
stand higher than his deserts, because he can contrive to
hold his tongue and has just wit enough to dodge the
question. And there is no force whatever in an unwillingness
to give forth nonsense, or in the dread of making
one's self ridiculous. It is part of our duty to be nonsensical
and ridiculous at times, for the entertainment of
the rest of the world; and, if not qualified for a more
elevated share in the performance, why should we shrink
from the role allotted to us by nature? Besides, if we
are never to open our mouths until the unsealing of the
aperture is to give evidence of a present Solomon, and to
add something to the Book of Proverbs, we must, for the

<!-- page 86 -->

most part, stand like the statue of Harpocrates, with "still
your finger on your lips, I pray." If we do speak, under
such restrictions, it cannot well be, as the world is constituted,
more than once or twice in the course of an existence,
the rest of the sojourn upon earth being devoted
to a sublimation of our thought. But always wise, sensible,
sagacious, rational&mdash;always in wig and spectacles&mdash;always
algebraic and mathematical&mdash;doctrinal and didactic&mdash;ever
to sit like Franklin's portrait, with the index fixed
upon "causality"&mdash;one might as well be a petrified
"professor," or a William Penn bronzed upon a pedestal.
There is nothing so good, either in itself or in its effects,
as good nonsense. It is, in truth, the work of genius to
produce the best article of the kind, and, if men and
women cannot reach the climax in this particular, they
owe it to the common welfare to soar as near it as their
limited capacity will allow.</p>

<p>But, while it is regarded as a bounden duty upon all
who enjoy the protection of society, to talk on proper
occasions, both for the benefit of others, and that, for
ulterior purposes, the strength of each individual may be
properly appreciated, still there is no intention to undervalue
the advantage afforded by good listeners. They
are a source of blessing for which the talking world cannot
be too grateful. Did they not exist, the vast steam-engine
of human ability would lack its safety-valve.
Explosion would ensue, or we should murderously talk
each other to death. The man fraught with intellectual
product, would find no market for its disposition. The
quick fancies of his wit would beat against the bars in
vain, and perish miserably by their own efforts to escape.
Our thinkings are for exportation&mdash;not to be consumed
within. There must be no embargo on the brain, or the
factory is stopped by accumulating goods. Hence, the
speaker and the listener combine to make a perfect whole.

<!-- page 87 -->

The one is the soil&mdash;the other the sun&mdash;the plant and
that refreshing shower, which enables the leaf to put
forth and the bud to bloom. No man, whatever may be
the intrinsic force of his genius, can form an idea of
what he is capable, until he is well listened to. Much of
his power lies in the auditory. There is a subtle correspondence
between them, which raises or depresses as
the sympathetic intercommunication happens to be the
more or less perfect in its vibrations. But there should
be alternation in this, to develope human powers, to increase
human affections, to complete the republic. There
must be no division into exclusive classes, the one all
vivacity, all pertness, all tongue&mdash;an unremitting volume
of sound and a vocal perpetuity of motion; while the
other, subdued and overwhelmed, curves into a huge
concavity of ear, into a mere tympanum for the everlasting
drummer to play upon. Where this happens to be
the case, from colloquial encroachments on the one hand,
and from submissive dispositions on the other, there is a
double degeneration&mdash;to words without meaning, and to
hearing without heeding. They who are talked to beyond
the bounds of salutary affliction, only escape the
fatal result of being subjected to such cruelty, by emulating
the rhinoceros in his impervious cuticle; so that the
pattering storm of speech rebounds innocuously from the
surface. They close the porches of the sense while elocution
rages around them, and, snug within, cogitate securely
upon their own ruminations. Turn from your florid
rhetoric to the sharp interrogation, and you shall find the
patient fast asleep as to external uproar, though his eyes
be open. Nature has provided him with a safeguard&mdash;he
has been bucklered by inattention, and has left you to
your own applause.</p>

<p>To listen well, it is not enough that we yield, rescue or
no rescue, and ask not for quarter, when detained by the

<!-- page 88 -->

button or cornered in a <i>cul de sac</i>. More is required than
hopeless resignation, as, with a sigh, we surrender to an
inevitable fate. The abject look, so generally worn by
the man who knows that he is going to be talked to, and
evinces by his aspect that he has no hope of mercy, is
unworthy of the heroic soul. It is emphatically an art,
and it is scarcely necessary to state that there are moments
when it is no easy art, to "lend me your ears" to our
mutual profit and pleasure. This is not an anatomical
demonstration we are upon, that the mere handing over
of the physical body is sufficient. Your imaginations are
not to ramble all about the fields, nozzling in every bush
and giving chase to every butterfly. The appropriate interjection
is wanted, living, breathing, burning; nicely
timed, too, and imperceptibly strengthening the oratorical
wing&mdash;not like the Roman citizen of the mimic stage,
whose accordance with Brutus and whose sympathies
with Antony, are stamped with that indifference which
arises from supernumerary station, and whose limited
share of the receipts causes him to care no more than the
worth of fifty cents about "C&aelig;sar's testament"&mdash;but as
if the business were your own. It is imperative on you
to adjust the countenance to the nicest expression of appreciating
intelligence&mdash;to be in tune, not only in the
tones of the voice, but in the cadence of the body&mdash;to
display attention in the very play of the fingers&mdash;to laugh
readily, just enough and no more, and to show by slight
subsequent observation, that all which has been uttered
is duly estimated, instead of bringing the speaker to the
ground with a jarring shock, by betraying, in an unconscious
word, that his flight has been alone. The mere
powers of endurance&mdash;fortitude, patience, and long-suffering&mdash;are
indeed much; but still, they are but a part of
what is demanded. If it were not so, the passive pump,
which stands in sad aridity before the door, would answer

<!-- page 89 -->

every purpose. More is necessary than to be an
unresisting recipient&mdash;a conversational "Deaf Burke,"
who can endure any amount of "punishment" without
being much the worse for it. Like the red warrior at
the stake, the perfect listener should so comport himself
as to induce the belief that he has pleasure in his pain,
and invites its increased continuance. He should be
made up of tact and benevolence&mdash;of courage and humanity.
His nerve should be strong&mdash;his perception
nice. At one moment he needs forbearance, to suppress
the almost irresistible interruption, and anon, his rapid
powers of anticipation must be ridden with a curb. His
philological expertness cannot be permitted to patch the
gaps of hesitancy, by the impertinent suggestion of a
word; but, when intuitive promptness is expected, a
broken syllable should point the way to a desired conclusion.
Worse, much worse than nothing, is the uneasy
listener, who, like "Sister Ann" upon the tower, gazes
every way for relief, and "sees it galloping" at each
passing cloud of dust, as if, in short, our beard were blue,
and our tongue were as remorseless and as sharp as a
Turkish scimitar; and worse than Sister Ann is the abstracted
companion, who knows nothing of the subjunctive
mood, but endeavours to break the finely woven
thread of your discourse by crossing you with irrelevant
ideas&mdash;he who interrupts your pathetic revelations&mdash;perhaps
of love&mdash;you were in love once&mdash;almost everybody
is&mdash;by coolly inquiring "when you saw Smith?"&mdash;As if
you cared any thing about Smith&mdash;or were even thinking
of Smith. Hang Smith!&mdash;Never suffer yourself thus to be
overcome by Smith, and never talk to that man again, if
another is to be had. Nor are kindly feelings to be entertained
towards the accommodating friend, that provoking
extract from the "Book of Martyrology," who
sits him down as nearly as possible in the attitude which

<!-- page 90 -->

patience has upon a monument, and looks at your approach
as if you were surgery itself, fresh from the schools,
all glitter with instruments and draped in bandage&mdash;compassionating
his hard lot, but setting his teeth to suffer.
Mark it well. Should you propose to tell this fellow any
thing&mdash;volunteering to explain to him how it happened,
clearly and circumstantially, and with no other view than
to his enlightenment, be prepared for ingratitude, in advance&mdash;ingratitude,
"more strong than traitors' arms."
A cold reluctance is within him, and he tries to play Procrustes
with your narrative, by asking "how long it will
take" to give it expression, his tolerance of you being
measured horologically, as it were, by the hour-glass and
dial. A shower-bath is warm encouragement compared
to his notes of acquiescence; and if he does not yawn&mdash;what
on earth are we to do with people that yawn?&mdash;is
there no remedy in legislative action?&mdash;why, he always
swears he understands&mdash;"oh, yes&mdash;perfectly"&mdash;while
calculating the odds and chances of some distant speculation,
to which you are not a party. It will be observed
that individuals of such a sort are troubled with a propensity
to know "what o'clock it is"&mdash;not that they have
any particular interest in the hour, on their own personal
account, but from a vague hope that the time of day may
chance to have something in it alarming to you, and that
you are to be scared from your present prey to attend to
a remote engagement. A benevolent hearer never wants
to know what o'clock it is. There is a morose misanthropy
in the desire, of which he is incapable; and if an
acquaintance with the precise moment be inadvertently
forced upon him, he has no such cruelty in his bosom as
to affect a look of surprise and consternation, while he
hypocritically protests that he had "no idea it was so
late." They who are loudest in saying that they had
"no idea it was so late," for the most part, fib. They

<!-- page 91 -->

had that idea, and more. They believed that it was as
late, and they hoped it might be a great deal later. They
were waiting for the clock to sue out a <i>habeas corpus</i> in
their case. "Didn't think it was so late," indeed.
Pshaw! What question was there touching hours and
minutes, when our story was but half developed? Were
we singing to Maelzel's Metronome, pry'thee, that we
are thus to be reminded of beats and bars, and the prescribed
measure of a stave? "Late," say'st thou?
What is "late?"&mdash;There is no such thing as "late" in
modern civilization. Steam has annihilated space, and
the "dead-latch-key" has left the word "late" a place
in the vocabulary, no doubt; but it has been deprived
of its operative meaning. When some one sat up for
you, then lateness was possible; but now&mdash;do you see
this little bar of steel, with its pendant and arabesque termination&mdash;this
talismanic "open sesame?" "Late"
expired when the powers of invention reached their climax
in fashioning forth this curious instrument. No one
can come in late. Sit thee still, and be not antediluvian.
Now-a-days, and especially now-a-nights, it is always
early enough.</p>

<p>But good listeners, as there has been unhappily too
much occasion to show, are rarities. When they die,
they should have monuments loftier far than that of
Cheops. Pyramids, with "forty centuries looking from
their top," would not be too much of honour for such
philanthropists; and, to render education what it ought to
be, the human family should be trained to listen, and, at
the same time, taught to talk. To sit still with dignity
and composure, is as difficult as to move with ease and
grace; yet both are matters of importance in the work of
refinement. But it is much more essential to success that
our presence should be hailed with pleasure, because, whether
speaking or being spoken to, the faculty is possessed of

<!-- page 92 -->

giving pleasure to those by whom we are surrounded.
To converse well&mdash;to gossip delightfully, is an art that
richly deserves to be studied. It does not follow that
one is a conversationist, or a perfect gossip, by such endowments,
valuable as they are when properly qualified
by a little of the "allaying Tiber" of sound discretion, as
fertility of mind, a magazine of facts, and a flood of
fluency. "Did you ever hear me preach?" said Coleridge
to Charles Lamb. "I never heard you do any
thing else," was the sarcastic but truthful reply; and
herein abides the common error. There is a fever of
talkativeness, occasional with some, but constitutional in
others, which is the bane of social enjoyment. "First-fiddleism"
is as unpleasant to come in contact with, as to
pass an evening encaged with a lion of literary, scientific,
or metaphysical renown. Your Van Amburgs and your
Driesbachs may be fitted for such an encounter; but mortals
of inferior nerve find an unpleasant species of annihilation
in the contact. Do not, then, attempt the lion's
part, even if it be "nothing but roaring;" nor, unless
assured past doubt that you possess the skill of Nicolo
Paganini, is it ever wise to compel protracted attention
to your single string, when others have quite as strong a
desire to scrape their Cremonas, as that which burns in
your own musical bosom. Play no more than is necessary
to the harmonious effect of the whole orchestra; and,
should occasion offer for a solo, give it and be done.
Monopoly in discourse is "most tolerable, and not to be
endured." It should be punishable by statute, thus to
invade the inalienable right of utterance.</p>

<p>It is not even freedom to go abroad, when the garrulous
kite has wing, to swoop upon his quarry. The
liberty&mdash;the life itself&mdash;of the citizen is at stake, from that
stoutly timbered magazine of words, who, strengthened
by practice, and warmed by self-complacency, sustains

<!-- page 93 -->

no injury from wind or weather, and will dilate for hours,
in frosty streets, to those who come within the dreadful
clutch. We see him now, smiling in conscious triumph,
as his prize shivers, shakes, and trembles almost to spectral
nothingness, and feels most sadly that this is not all
his sufferings&mdash;that catarrhs, and feverous aches and pains
creep into him at every word. Homicidal&mdash;is it not, thus
to thin out our population? An oversight in criminal
jurisprudence, to let destruction forth into the highways,
to run at unprotected men. Cunning doctors do not note
it in their cautions, and the bills of mortality are silent on
the subject; but it is no less a truth, that though the victim
may sometimes be able to travel homeward after the
catastrophe, he often gets him to his bed, if he escape the
undertaker, from such combined assaults of breeze and
bore as are now before us. Wouldst thou despatch thine
enemy? What need of steel or poison&mdash;why lurk in
slouched hat, in moustache, or with stiletto? There is a
safer method, and, having no other accomplice than the
thermometer, waylay him as he goes, with smiling face
and oiled tongue. You have him there, and safely too.
Chemistry has no surer poison, if you hold him fast; and
justice has no cognisance of the deed.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The true conversationist requires as nice a balance of
qualities as the adroit swordsman. He should have an
eye, an ear and a tongue, equally on the alert, perfectly
under control, and skilled to act together. It is his duty
to be able to mark the moment when a slumbering idea
is awakened in the mind of another, and to afford opportunity
for its development. When the thought quivers
in an almost inaudible murmur upon the lips of the timid,
it is not to be suppressed in premature death by the rattling
noise of practised confidence; not to be driven over,

<!-- page 94 -->

if we may so describe it, by each hackney cab that thunders
up the street. It claims to be deferentially educed,
not so much by a display of patronising encouragement,
which is almost as fatal as harsh disregard, but by that
respectful attention which creates no painful sense of inferiority.
He cannot pretend to civilization, who, in his
wild dance of intellectual excitement, tramples under his
massive foot all the little chickens of our imagination,
and scares each half-fledged fancy back to its native shell.
Be it rather your pleasure to chirp the tremblers forth to
the corn of praise and the sunshine of approbation. Who
has not found himself to be totally absorbed by the volubility
of others; so that he could neither find subject nor
words, even when an interval was left for their exercise?
And who has not often been altogether debarred from the
delight of speaking, merely because he had not space to
set himself fully in motion? Many, perhaps, have resigned
themselves to the taciturnity of La Trappe and
have gone voiceless to their graves, from injudicious
treatment in this respect. The humane citizen, then,
will not of himself take all the labour of talking, lest he
may be inadvertently stifling a Demosthenes, and smothering
a Cicero&mdash;a case, it is true, which does not very
often happen, though it might happen.</p>

<p>And, besides, let it be remarked, there is no fact, in
our day of innovation, scheming and discovery&mdash;when
we reform, remodel, and lay our hands upon every thing&mdash;which
deserves to be more strongly imprinted on the
recollection than this, that man does not go forth into
society, "no, nor woman neither," armed, <i>cap-&agrave;-pie</i>, like
a gladiator, to battle for opinion, or to thrust the sword
of conversion through reluctant ribs. Let such things be
confined to the dedicated halls of controversial debate,
where one may be polemically impaled, <i>secundum artem</i>,
expecting no better treatment. It is good to be wise&mdash;"merry

<!-- page 95 -->

and wise," saith the song; but, then, wisdom
need not always be at our throat with spoon and bowl,
determined to administer nutriment, without regard to the
state of the appetite. Did it never occur to you, my
game friend, as you strapped on your gaffs, and crowed
defiance at a rooster of another feather, that the rest of
the social circle do not derive your pleasure from the "set-to,"
and would gladly be excused from being annoyed by
the argumentative combat? And, as for hobbies, they
prance prettily enough on their proper ground; but do
not let them caracole in the parlour. People would rather
be kicked by any thing than by other people's hobbies;
and, again, these hobbies, being merely composed of wood
and leather, are never wearied, and cannot stop. They
outstrip everybody, and carry none with them. Hark, in
your ear. Leave hobby at home; he will not be restive
or break things, when you are not by. It is disagreeable
to be ridden down by these unaccommodating quadrupeds.
Folks do not like it.</p>

<p>The engrossing idea, too, should be hung up with the
hat in the vestibule. It is near enough there; and, admitting
that you have troubles of your own, ambitions of
your own, prospects of your own, projects and inventions
of your own, let it always be borne distinctly in mind
that this, singular as it may appear, is, to a certain degree,
the case with several other individuals of your acquaintance.
What right they have to an engrossing idea
when yours wishes to awaken their sympathies, is a point
of equity which we cannot take it upon ourselves to decide;
but it is so, nevertheless, as the groaning soldier
found when rebuked for making so much noise over
his hurts, "as if, forsooth, no one is hit but yourself."&mdash;"Am
I then reposing on a bed of roses?" said Guatemozin,
in a similar spirit, to his complaining courtier,
when Spanish cruelty had stretched them upon the

<!-- page 96 -->

glowing grate; and every man has, to some extent, a
gridiron to himself.&mdash;To push this point still further, are
they entitled to rank with conversationists, who stand as
greyhounds on the slip, with straining eyes and quivering
limbs, heedless of all remark, and waiting only till an
opening be made, that they may course their peculiar
game, rabbit or otherwise, as the case may be? Are
they qualified gossips, who only talk to exercise the organ,
and to luxuriate on the sound of their own sweet voices?&mdash;who,
at last, dash forward over every impediment, and,
by their bad example, like prairie horses in a stampede,
set the whole circle into a very Babel of tongues&mdash;into
what we may call a steeple-chase, straight across the
country, and through any man's field&mdash;each for himself,
boot and saddle, whip and spur? Nay, never think it.
He is scant in his schooling who shifts impatiently from
foot to foot when another has the floor&mdash;who darts his
restless head into the aperture of every pause, in the hope
that the shoulders may be permitted to follow, and who is
only kept in abeyance by those stentorian lungs which
crush the puny interruption.</p>

<p>No&mdash;to gossip well is a delicate thing&mdash;a game of address&mdash;a
school of self-command&mdash;an academy for nice
perceptions. To be skilled in it, involves the main points
of an accomplished gentleman. It furnishes, moreover,
a key to character. The selfish man cannot be versed
in it, for he has no appreciation of the minor rights of
others, and, in this garden, no compulsory code exists to
prevent him from pocketing all the fruit. Harshness is
incompatible with it, for it is the very essence of respectful
consideration. The domineering spirit cannot gain
laurels here; while pride and vanity display themselves
in their true colours. The proselytes of Lavater and the
disciples of Combe may, by their science, be enabled to
read the soul; but, as the one traces the lines of the countenance,

<!-- page 97 -->

and the other toils among the hills and valleys
of the skull, the surest observer of disposition is he who
notes the deportment of those bearing part in the animated
gossip. Before him, the secret unrolls like a map, and
the geography of the heart is familiar to his searching eye.
When the glow lights up within, there is a ray behind
the best adjusted mask which reveals the features as
they are.</p>

<p>As the day is utilitarian, the <i>cui bono</i>, the advantage
and the profit, form a material part of every matter, and it
will be found that to cultivate these responsive faculties&mdash;to
add the art of hearing and of speaking to the catalogue
of accomplishments&mdash;has a moral as well as a pleasure
in it. A skilful talker, who is, at the same time, a
thorough listener, is not a spontaneity&mdash;an unlessoned
creature. Oaks do not bear such acorns. The spirit of
such a one, if feeble, has been strengthened. His temper,
if tempestuous, has been subdued. He has sympathies,
cultivated and refined. He feels for those around him,
in great things and in small. He is that wisest of philosophers,
the well regulated man of the world, who shuns
the wrong because he knows its evils, and adopts the
right, from having proved it to be an essential to his own
happiness, and the happiness of others. And what contributes
more largely to this important end, than a perfect
system of hearing and of being heard? Nature does not
furnish it. To be nothing more than natural, is to be an
egotist, a glutton, a monopolizer. That the untrained steed
has power enough, is not to be disputed; but, in the simplicity
of his unsophisticated heart, he is apt to apply his
strength in an uncomfortable manner, to those who wander
within range of his heel, never thinking that the joy he
derives from the rapid extension of his locomotive muscles,
is not likely to be reciprocated on our part. He is
not aware of the difference of sensation between kicking

<!-- page 98 -->

and being kicked, which is often a point to be considered.
It is even so with bipeds, who have not properly undergone
the discipline of the <i>man&egrave;ge</i>. It cannot be denied
that the child of nature has something in him of the poetical;
but, in practice, he is likely to border on the uncouth
and uncontrollable.</p>

<p>If, therefore, after the experiment of a year, according
to our suggestion, it be found that the trial does not bring
out the better constituents of character, while restraining
those of less amiability, why, continue to chatter, without
stint or limitation, to the end of your days, and throw no
chance away, unless compelled to it by exhaustion; or, if
it please you, sit in sulky silence, and have never a word
by way of change.</p>

<p>SHIVERTON SHAKES;</p>

<p class="small">OR, THE UNEXPRESSED IDEA.</p>

</div>

<p>SHIVERTON SHAKES had an idea&mdash;a cup of tea had
warmed the soil of his imagination, and it was flowering
to fruit&mdash;he had an idea in bud&mdash;a thought which struggled
to expand into expression, and to find a place in the
great basket of human knowledge.</p>

<p>Shiverton Shakes had an idea, and ideas, whether great
or small&mdash;whether good, bad or indifferent&mdash;must have
utterance, or the understanding wilts and withers. Even
the body sympathetically suffers. It is easy to mark the
man who smothers his intellectual offspring&mdash;the moral
infanticide, with his compressed lip, his cadaverous hue,
his sinister eye, and his cold, cautious deportment; whose
thinkings never go out of doors, and lack health for want
of air and exercise. That man is punished for his cruelty
to nature, by a dyspepsia affecting both his mental and
physical organization. There is no health in him.</p>

<p>But it must not be forgotten that Shiverton Shakes had
an idea&mdash;little Shiverton, in his earlier years, when the
world is fresh and new, and when the opening faculties
are wild in their amazement.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said Shiverton, suspending the assault
upon his bread and butter, "mamma, what d'ye think?&mdash;as
I was going down&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Shakes were too earnestly engaged in
the interchange of their own fancies, to heed the infantile
voice of Shiverton.</p>

<p>"What d'ye think, ma?" repeated the youthful aspirant
for the honour of a hearing; "as I was going down
Chestnut street, I saw&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 100 -->

<p>"A little more sugar, my dear," said Mr. Shakes.</p>

<p>"And, as I was telling you," added Mrs. Shakes,
"Mary Jones has got&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sweetened to death! There&mdash;don't!" said Mr.
Shakes, withdrawing his cup rather petulantly.</p>

<p>"Down Chestnut street, I saw&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A new black hat, trimmed with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sugar enough to fill a barrel," muttered Mr.
Shakes.</p>

<p>"I saw&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hat with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tea spoilt altogether&mdash;give me another&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very little black hat, trimmed with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Two boys, and what d'ye think!" chimed in the persevering
Shiverton Shakes.</p>

<p>"Why, what is all this?" exclaimed Mr. Shakes, as
he raised his eyes in anger. "Hats and boys and sugar!
I never heard such a Babel!"</p>

<p>"That child!" ejaculated Mrs. Shakes; "did you ever
know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Two boys, and they were a&mdash;" continued Shiverton,
pursuing his own peculiar train of reminiscence, undisturbed
by Mary Jones or any thing else, and happy in
feeling that there now appeared to be no impediment to
the flow of his narrative.</p>

<p>But yet, this moment, though he knew it not, was a
crisis in the fate of Shiverton Shakes&mdash;a circumflex in the
line of his being; slight perhaps in itself, but very material
in determining the result of the journey.</p>

<p>Mr. Shakes fixed his eye upon his son&mdash;Mr. Shakes
seemed to ponder for a moment.</p>

<p>"I cannot stand it any longer," said he, "and what is
more, I won't&mdash;that boy is a nuisance&mdash;he talks so much
that I cannot tell what I'm reading, taste what I'm eating,
or hear what I'm saying. I'm not sure, in fact, when he

<!-- page 101 -->

is present, that I know exactly whether it's me or not,
He wants to talk all the time."</p>

<p>Luckless Shiverton had been running wild in the
country for a considerable period, and, while his elocutionary
capacities had been greatly developed, the power of
endurance in his parents had been weakened for want of
exercise. They were out of practice&mdash;he was in high
training. They were somewhat nervous,&mdash;he was, both
in mind and body, in the best possible condition, deriving
as much nourishment from the excitement of noise as
he did from food.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare, he does talk all the time and asks
such questions&mdash;so foolish I can't answer them," exclaimed
the mother, with her usual volubility; "just as
if there was a reason for every thing&mdash;so tiresome. I do
declare, when he is in the room, I can scarcely slip in a
word edgeways, and his tongue keeps such a perpetual
clatter, that since he came back, I hardly think I've heard
my own voice more than&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You hear it now," said Mr. Shakes; "but I'm determined
Shiverton shall be spoiled no longer. Do you
hear? From this time forth, you must never speak but
when you are spoken to. Little boys must be seen, and
not heard."</p>

<p>"Well, I do declare, so they must&mdash;mus'n't be seen
and not be heard&mdash;that's the way to bring up children."</p>

<p>"Shiverton," added his father, impressively; "Shiverton,
when you are old enough to talk sensibly, then
you may talk. When you are mature enough&mdash;I say
mature&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is mature?" inquired Shiverton, tremblingly.</p>

<p>"Mature is&mdash;never mind what it is&mdash;when you are
older you'll know. But, as I before remarked, when you
are mature enough to understand things, then you may
ask about them."</p>

<!-- page 102 -->

<p>The rule, thus emphatically laid down, was enforced
inexorably. It, therefore, not only happened that Shiverton's
idea was suppressed on the occasion referred to,
thus preventing the world from ever arriving at a knowledge
of what really was done by those two mysterious
boys, as he went down Chestnut street, but likewise cutting
him off from other communications relative to the
results of his experience and observation. Henceforth he
was to be seen, not heard&mdash;a precept and a rule of conduct
which he was compelled to write in his copybook,
as well as to hear, whenever the workings of his spirit
prompted him to "speak as to his thinkings." The twig
was bent&mdash;the tree inclined.</p>

<p>What Shiverton Shakes might have been, had the
trunk of his genius been permitted to ascend according to
its original impulse, is now but matter for conjecture.
How far he would have reached in his umbrageous expansion,
had the shoots of his soul been judiciously
trimmed and trellised&mdash;sunned, shaded and watered&mdash;who
can tell? There may be a blank in glory's book which
his name should have filled&mdash;an empty niche in our century's
greatness, where Shiverton Shakes should have been
embalmed. At this instant, perhaps, the world suffers
because some momentous truth which it was for him to
have drawn to light, is still "hushed within the hollow
mine of earth." Why, indeed, may we not suppose that
when he was rebuked for making chips, to the annoyance
of the tidy housekeeper, an invention perished in its very
inception which would have superseded the steam-engine?
What might Shiverton Shakes&mdash;Shiverton cherished&mdash;Shakes
undismayed&mdash;what might he not have been? A
warrior, probably, phlebotomizing men by the battalion
and by the brigade, and piling skulls to build his way to
fame. Why not a patriot and a statesman, heading parties
and carrying elections, with speeches from the stump

<!-- page 103 -->

and huzzas from the multitude? Nor would it be considering
too curiously if it were to be imagined that, had
circumstances been propitious, Shiverton Shakes might,
at this very hour, have been in the enjoyment of the highest
of human honours and the most sublime of modern inventions,
that of being pilloried by the political press and
flung at by half the nation&mdash;the new pleasure, for which
an exhausted voluptuary of the classic age breathed sighs
in vain.</p>

<p>But such delights as these were denied to Shiverton
Shakes, who was too strictly taught to be seen and not
heard&mdash;who was not to speak until he was spoken to; in
consequence whereof, as the invitation was not very often
extended, he came near being deprived of the faculty of
speech altogether.</p>

<p>When Shiverton Shakes came home&mdash;"why, there's
company in the parlour," and Shiverton Shakes went to
learn manners and deportment in the kitchen. Shiverton
Shakes breakfasted, dined and supped in the kitchen, and
when promoted by a call up stairs, Shiverton mumbled in
his words, fumbled in his pockets and rumpled among
his hair. An ungainly lout was Shiverton Shakes. He
had been, so to speak, paralyzed by his undeveloped
idea. His original confidence, instead of being modulated
and modified, had been extirpated, and the natural <i>aplomb</i>
of his character&mdash;that which keeps men on their feet,
maintaining the adjustment and balance of their faculties&mdash;had
been destroyed.</p>

<p>"The boy is a booby," said Mr. Shakes; "why can't
you stand up straight and speak out?&mdash;you're old enough."</p>

<p>"Well, I do declare," subjoined Mrs. Shakes, "I'm
quite ashamed of him. I can't think how he came to be
such a goose. When Mary Jones spoke to him the other
day, I do declare if he didn't put his thumb right in his
eye, and almost twist himself out of his jacket; and when

<!-- page 104 -->

she asked him what he learned at school, all he could
say was 'he! he! I don't know.' He shan't show himself
again till he behaves better&mdash;a great long&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't like to be harsh&mdash;in fact, I'm rather too indulgent,"
philanthropically remarked Mr. Shakes; "but,
if I were to do my duty by this boy, I ought to chastise
him out of these awkward tricks. There&mdash;go&mdash;down
stairs with you. It's the only place you're fit for."</p>

<p>"He must never be allowed to come up when any
body's here&mdash;not till he knows how to speak to people."</p>

<p>Such was the earlier life of Shiverton Shakes. He
was not to plunge into the billows of the world before he
had learned to swim, and yet was denied the opportunity
to acquire the rudiments of this species of natation, in
those smaller rills and ripples where alone the necessary
confidence and dexterity are to be obtained. It was perhaps
believed that he could cast the boy off and assume
the man, without preliminary training, and that, having
been seen but not heard, for so many years, he would have
an instinctive force, at the proper moment, to cause himself
both to be seen and heard, thus suddenly stepping
from one extreme to the other. There may be such
forces in some people&mdash;in people who, in a phrenological
aspect, have a large propelling power, to drive them
over the snags, sawyers and shallows of this "shoal of
time." They were not, however, to be found in Shiverton
Shakes. Nor was he a proof of the correctness of
that common parental theory, so often urged to palliate
and to excuse deficiencies in culture and supervision,
that he would "know better when he grew older," thus
endeavouring to make future years responsible for duties
which should be performed by ourselves and at the existing
moment. This method of "knowing better" may suit
the procrastinating disposition, and there may be instances
in which it engenders a corrective influence; but it

<!-- page 105 -->

is at best a doubtful experiment to permit defects to
"harden into petrifaction," while awaiting the uncertain
period of removal. That we may "know better when
we are older" is like enough; but then, will we do better?
Who, of all the world, does better&mdash;much better&mdash;half
as much better as he ought&mdash;as he "knows better?"
There are differences, sad to experience, hard to overcome,
between knowing and doing. The right habitude
is the surest panoply. Shiverton Shakes had no habitude
but the wrong habitude&mdash;no panoply at all.</p>

<p>Shiverton went forth into the world&mdash;shrinkingly forth&mdash;modestly
forth, and so forth, which perhaps is very amiable
as an abstraction, though its value, in a peculiarly
brazen state of society, is not quite so great, in a practical
point of view, as the school-books would have us to believe&mdash;for
if, as we are told, this modesty is a candle to
one's merit, there must be some strange omission in regard
to lighting the wick, and, unless that process be complied
with, it is as clear as darkness can make it, that all
the candles in the universe will do but little toward an
illumination. It is at least certain that Shiverton's merit
gained no refulgence from his unobtrusiveness, and that
his retiring disposition, so far from promoting his interests
and extending his fame, according to the philosophic
notion on the subject, came near causing him to be pushed
out of sight and forgotten altogether. No one searched
him from his obscurity&mdash;fortune passed by his door without
knocking, and reputation swept onward without
offering him a seat in its vehicle. Yet Shiverton was as
modest as modest could be&mdash;as modest, according to the
popular comparison, as a sheep. He thought nothing of
himself at all&mdash;he invariably got out of the way when
other people wanted to advance, on the principle of "after
you is manners," and when others spoke first, he was
particularly careful to speak last, or not to speak at all;

<!-- page 106 -->

suppressing his own wishes, feelings, and opinions, to promote
the general harmony. A retiring man was Shiverton,
and he obtained an occupation wherein his main
intercourse was with his pen and with columns of figures,
so that he still could be seen and not heard, according to
the regulation which governed his childhood. He stooped
as he walked, that his superiority of height (for Shiverton
had stretched in longitude far beyond his unpretending
wishes) might be lost, as it were, in the smaller crowd;
and he went home, as far as it was possible to do so, by
the "alley way," to escape the ostentation of parading the
thoroughfares, and to elude the embarrassing operation
of returning salutations to those with whom he was unavoidably
acquainted. What would Shiverton Shakes
not have given if he had known nobody&mdash;if there were
nobody here but himself, or if he could consume this
troublesome "how d'ye do" existence in a back room,
up three pair of stairs, where no one could by possibility
come? And his bashfulness grew by being indulged.
He suffered, not only by the painful sensations of his
own timidity, but more by the thought that others likewise
saw into his perturbations, and derived enjoyment
from his internal distress. He appropriated every laugh
to himself&mdash;he could not think that when he was within
range of observation, there could reasonably be any
other jest so likely to provoke a smile; and when people
talked together with mirthfulness on their countenance,
he was sure that the awkwardnesses and defects of Shiverton
Shakes were under discussion. He had never heard
of any thing else at home, and he always felt as if he
were a discreditable intruder, who ought, if any thing, to
apologize for having come into this breathing world at
all. Had there been such a thing as a back door to our
sublunary sphere, he would certainly have opened it, if
it could have been done without noise, and have crept

<!-- page 107 -->

out, glad to escape into the immeasurable solitude of
ether.</p>

<p>But a retreat of this sort is not possible, according to
existing planetary arrangements, without a recourse to
means to which Shakes had a repugnance. The sensibility
of his nervous system rejected the thought of a cold
bath by midnight, with brickbats in his vest and paving
stones in his coat pockets&mdash;the pistol is a means of dismissal
altogether too noisy for the retiring disposition, and
the elevation of the cord shows an aspiring temper which
would not have been at all characteristic in Shiverton
Shakes. Besides, a jury in such cases generally looks
for the impulsive reason, and how ridiculous it would
seem to be returned in the newspapers, as one who had
voluntarily gone defunct through lack of brass! Such an
imagination could not be entertained even for an instant.
There would be more chuckling than ever. Shiverton
resolved to live&mdash;to be Shakes to the end of his terraqueous
term, no matter how unpleasant it might be.</p>

<p>Still, however, man&oelig;uvre as one may, we cannot
always avoid contact with the world in some of its phases.
Invitations will come, for instance, from which there is
no moral possibility of evasion. To be very unwell,
sometimes answers a good purpose, if indeed these dodging
purposes be ever good, when the motive is simply a dodge
from a failure in self-reliance. It will do to have prior
engagements occasionally when none such exist, and the
pressure of business at certain seasons may be extreme;
but, exert ourselves to that end as we may, there are few
individuals who can contrive to be ill all the time, or
always to have a prior engagement, or to be busy so continually
as not to have an evening to spare; and then a
point blank <i>non inventus</i>, without the shadow of a palliation,
is scarcely to be attempted under certain circumstances.
It requires the imperturbable solidity of a dead

<!-- page 108 -->

wall to be guilty of it. It sits upon the soul like a nightmare,
and the guilty wakes next morning with a conscience
as heavy as a millstone. Shiverton Shakes was
cornered by such an invitation&mdash;to a dance of the most
extensive and brilliant description&mdash;in honour of the marriage
of the daughter of one concerning whom he had
<i>post mortem</i> expectations&mdash;expectations which he fondly
dreamed would productively survive the individual who
had given rise to them. It was, therefore, what we may
call, for want of an established phrase to describe it, the
invitation undeniable&mdash;the trident of an appeal, which
forks on either side and pins one through the body. It
was an invitation which, with all Shiverton's agile practice
in this respect, he could neither leap over nor
creep under. It was not to be got round, on the right
hand or upon the left. It enflanked and enfiladed&mdash;encircled
and hemmed in. Yet, if boldly faced, it was obvious
that Shiverton Shakes could not help being, to some
extent at least, a feature on the occasion&mdash;occasions, like
countenances, must have features, or they cease to be
occasions. But to be suddenly elevated into a feature&mdash;projected
from the level into a promontory, like some
diver duck of a volcanic island&mdash;when we are not used
to it&mdash;when we don't know how! Who, in such a crisis,
could avoid feeling like Shakes? To be a protuberance&mdash;a
card&mdash;a first or a second fiddle, with no acquaintance
with the bow and innocent of rosin&mdash;to dance with the
bride&mdash;to be fascinating to the maids&mdash;to make himself
generally agreeable, he, who had never before been on
such hard duty&mdash;to be easy, graceful, and witty&mdash;"preposterous
and pestiferous!" cried Shiverton Shakes;
"me making myself agreeable! I should like to catch
myself at it."</p>

<p>Shiverton was haunted by Mrs. Marygold's note. In
his dreams, it was like the air drawn dagger of the tragedy.

<!-- page 109 -->

It seemed to "marshal him the way he was to go," and
beckoned him on, not to Duncan's surcease&mdash;Duncan
surceased in the dark&mdash;the fewer witnesses the better&mdash;but
to something much worse, in his fearful estimation&mdash;to
violins and laughter&mdash;to smiles and compliments&mdash;to
airs and graces&mdash;to silks and cologne&mdash;blooming bouquets,
pearly teeth and sparkling eyes&mdash;more terrible to
him than frowning ramparts and stern artillery.</p>

<p>Shiverton sat alone in his chamber. The lamp burned
dimly, and the fatal note, its perfume not yet departed,
lay before him.</p>

<p>"There's my ankle," said he, after a gloomy pause,
"if I could only sprain it now, without hurting myself
much&mdash;sprain it gently&mdash;but no&mdash;that won't do&mdash;they'd
guess in a minute&mdash;and I couldn't very conveniently contrive
to break my neck for a day or two, by way of
something original; but I almost wish it was broke. It
would save a fellow a great deal of trouble. I should
like to raise a fever, if I only knew how; but I can't find
a headache with all the shaking I can give it. Perhaps
it wouldn't do to be found 'no more' when they came, to
call me to breakfast, on the morning of this horrible
dance; but I wish I was no more&mdash;I wish I never had
been more at all. But more or less, I must go, if an
earthquake does not intervene, or if there is not a blow
up of some sort. But these things never happen when
they're wanted. I never found the dentist out in my life
when I was to be hurt. There are matters which can't
postpone. Hanging day is hanging day, whether it rains
or shines, and then hanging day is never yesterday&mdash;I
don't mind things when they're past&mdash;hanging day is
always to-morrow or to-day&mdash;something to come&mdash;something
that's not done, but must be done. It appears to
me that I'm never done, but always doing&mdash;going to be
done."</p>

<!-- page 110 -->

<p>After this escapade, Shiverton was moodily silent&mdash;expressionless
outwardly, save in the uneasy transposition
of his pedal extremities, while his brows were knitting
like a weaver's loom.</p>

<p>"If they'd let me be, now&mdash;but they won't&mdash;they never
do," continued he sharply; "let me be in a corner, or in
the refreshment room, eating things and drinking things&mdash;cracking
nuts, or forking pickled oysters, or spooning in
ice cream, and nobody looking on&mdash;it always chokes me
when anybody's looking on&mdash;things won't get on the spoon,
and my plate is sure to spill and run over&mdash;if they'd do so,
I'd be able to get along well enough; but then I must go
in among the ladies&mdash;there's nothing scares me more than
ladies&mdash;good-looking ladies particularly&mdash;I can't talk to
them&mdash;they frighten me like Old Scratch. Yet I've got
all the books about manners, in that closet&mdash;'American
Chesterfield,' 'Etiquette,' and all that&mdash;why don't somebody
publish how to flourish away in other people's
houses, so we can learn it in three lessons, like French,
Italian and Spanish? That's the kind of cheap literature
I want."</p>

<p>At last he sprung impatiently from his chair, and the
clock struck one.</p>

<p>"Since I must go to Mrs. Marygold's whether I will
or not, I had better begin to practise as soon as possible&mdash;practise
tea party"&mdash;and Shiverton brushed up his hair
and pulled down his wristbands; "that's the way, I suppose.&mdash;Now
I come in, so," and he threw his head aside
in a languishing manner&mdash;"Hope you're very well, Mrs.
Marygold&mdash;that chair's the old lady&mdash;how dee doo, Mrs.
Marygold&mdash;how's Bob?&mdash;no, not Bob&mdash;how is Mr.
Robert?&mdash;then that bedpost's the old man&mdash;compliments
to the old man&mdash;that wash-stand is the young ladies, all
of a bunch&mdash;your most obedient, says I, in a sort of off-hand
way&mdash;most obedient to the wash-stand, and a sort

<!-- page 111 -->

of a slide all round. Pooh! it's easy enough, if you go
right at it&mdash;who's afraid? Ha! ha!" and Shiverton be
came excited, bowing about the room. "Dance! why
yes, to be sure I will. Pleasure of dancing with Miss
Slammerkin?&mdash;ho! ho! tolderol! tolderol! chassez across&mdash;swing
corners&mdash;slambang! pigeon-wing!"</p>

<p>Shiverton's operations in this matter were rather of the
old school; more, it is to be presumed, from the dash of
desperation that tinged his spirit at the time, than from
any other cause; and so, forgetting, if he ever knew it,
the easy, unambitious and nonchalant manner of the modern
ball-room, he set arms and legs agoing with the
whirligig vigour and expansive reach of a windmill. The
floor creaked and trembled&mdash;the windows rattled and
shook; but still he danced away with the concentrated
energy of one who "had business would employ an
age, and but a moment's time to do it in." He was, in
fact, and without being conscious of it, realizing a great
moral and physiological truth. His mental uneasiness
found relief in physical action, on the principle which
renders the body restless when the mind is disturbed,
that the superabundance of the nervous force may be diverted
from our thoughts to our muscles. Care and bashfulness
seemed to be driven away together. The rust
flew off, and a momentary hardness and transient polish
appeared.</p>

<p>He upset the chair. "Mrs. Marygold's done for,"
said he, in breathless exultation. Crash went the table.
"Supper's over&mdash;let's waltz! Taglioni and Queen Victoria&mdash;who's
afraid! I knew I only wanted to begin, to
go ahead of D'Orsay!" and he flew round like a top, to
the complete discomfiture of the "Dukedom of Hereford
and those movables."</p>

<p>"Murder!&mdash;or fire!&mdash;or thieves!&mdash;or something!"
screamed Mrs. Fitzgig, the landlady, as she awoke in

<!-- page 112 -->

trepidation from her slumbers, the more appalled because
it was impossible to imagine what was the matter. Terror
is never so terrific as when we do not know what
terrifies us. "Boh!" cried in the dark, will unsettle the
firmest nerves, because it has never yet been decided
exactly what "Boh!" means. People will tremble and
run at "Boh!" who do not shrink from surgery or from
an unpaid bill.</p>

<p>The uproar continued, and at last Mrs. Fitzgig, with
her boarders, men, women and children, leaped from their
beds and rushed, blanketed and sheeted, to the scene of
action.</p>

<p>"Shiverton Shakes is crazy&mdash;run for Doctor Slop!"</p>

<p>"Shave his head!" said one.</p>

<p>"Knock him down!" exclaimed another.</p>

<p>"Law suz!" pathetically cried Mrs. Fitzgig, looking
at the devastation&mdash;"What's all this?"</p>

<p>"It's tea-party&mdash;it's hop&mdash;it's ball!" shouted Shiverton,
for once grown bold, and seizing upon his landlady&mdash;"Why
don't you jump along?&mdash;swing around&mdash;practice
makes perfect!"</p>

<p>The laughter, loud and long, which followed these
explanatory exclamations, brought Shiverton Shakes to
his senses, and awakened him from his dream of ball-room
triumph, as if he had suddenly been subjected to
the tranquillizing influence of a shower-bath.</p>

<p>"Exercise&mdash;nothing but exercise&mdash;bad health&mdash;too
much confined," muttered he&mdash;"a man must have exercise."</p>

<p>"But two o'clock in the morning's not the time, is it?
and breaking things is not the way, I guess," said Mrs.
Fitzgig, sulkily. Shiverton Shakes paid the damages,
but the balance of ridicule was not so easily settled. It
is a strange thing, too, that the rehearsal should be a subject
of derision, when the deed itself is rather commendable

<!-- page 113 -->

than otherwise. If a man is found making speeches
to himself, people will regard it as a joke, and should he
be discovered taking off his hat to his own reflection in
the mirror, that he may bow with grace in the street, and
perform his <i>devoir</i> to fair damsels with becoming elegance,
why he would never hear the last of it. Always turn the
key, and speak softly when practising gentlemanly deportment
to supposititious society. If you experience a
lack of preparatory drill in the art of making yourself
peculiarly agreeable, go through your discipline in the
vacant garret, and should there be no bolt to the entrance,
keep your face to the door, that you may confront the
sudden intruder, with a vacant countenance and the fragment
of a tune, as if nothing in the world were the matter.
Demosthenes himself must have felt what is now
termed "flat," when detected shoveling flints into his
mouth, to turnpike his vocalities, and to Macadamise the
way for his oratorical genius. To do such things is
praiseworthy. To be surprised in the act, is the offence.
The spirit of Lycurgus survives in the nineteenth century,
and the Spartans were not alone in thinking that it is not
the deed, but the discovery, which is to be reproved.
Shakes found it so, when jeered for his social training.
And, in referring to this popular contradiction, which
asks for the thing, and in some sort derides one of the
means of obtaining it, we cannot refrain from introducing,
as an illustration, a colloquy in which our hero bore a part.</p>

<p>It was in the evening, at Mrs. Fitzgig's&mdash;Shakes was
forlornly looking into the fire&mdash;but few of the family remained,
and Mr. Dashoff Uptosnuff, a gentleman probably
of northern descent, but professing to know a thing
or two in the west, twisted his moustache, adjusted his
flowing locks, and ceased for a moment to admire his legs.</p>

<p>"Shakes," said Dashoff Uptosnuff, "this sheepishness
of yours will never do, at your time of life."

<!-- page 114 -->

<p>"I know it," replied Shakes, with a sigh; "it never
did do, and I don't think it's going to do. But what am
I to do?"</p>

<p>"Do! where's the difficulty?&mdash;do like other people&mdash;do
like me&mdash;do, and don't be done. I tell you what it
is. Shakes, there's a double set of principles in this world,
one of which is to talk about, and the other to act upon&mdash;one
is preached, and the other is practised. You've got
hold, somehow, of the wrong set&mdash;the set invented by
the knowing ones, to check competition and to secure all
the good things for themselves. That's the reason people
are always praising modest merit, while they are pushing
along without either the one or the other. You always
let go, when anybody's going to take your place at table&mdash;you
always hold back, when another person's wanting the
last of the nice things on the dish. That's not the way&mdash;bow
and nod and show your teeth with a fascination, but
take what you want for all that. This is manners&mdash;knowing
the world. To be polite, is to have your own
way gracefully&mdash;other people are delighted at your style&mdash;you
have the profit."</p>

<p>"But I'm ashamed&mdash;what would people think?"</p>

<p>"Why, Shiverton Shakes, if you only learn to understand
the hocus pocus of it, they'll think of you just what
you wish them to think. Don't be afraid of other people&mdash;other
people is a goose. Hav'n't you found that out
yet? Who is ever afraid of people when he knows them
well&mdash;lives in the same house with them? You're not
afraid of Mrs. Fitzgig; you're not afraid of me&mdash;you're
not afraid of the washerwoman&mdash;not much afraid, even
when you owe her for the last quarter. Confidence is
only carrying out the principle&mdash;look upon everybody
as me, or Mrs. Fitzgig, or the washerwoman. That's
the way to do. As for your not knowing people, it
amounts to nothing&mdash;it's often an advantage&mdash;for then

<!-- page 115 -->

you may fairly conclude they don't know you. How are
battles gained? Because the party who run away, don't
know that their enemies were just about to do the same
thing&mdash;they don't know that their opponents were as
much scared as themselves. Look bluff, and the day's
your own. Nobody sees beyond appearances."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I can't do as you advise&mdash;I think I can
sometimes, when no person's by; but when I come to
try it, I can't&mdash;I feel so&mdash;my heart bumps so&mdash;my tongue's
so dry, and I always tumble over things and tread on
somebody's toe. I'm sure to tread on somebody's toe."</p>

<p>"Shiverton, you're a melancholy victim to the errors
of education and the wrong set of principles, or you
wouldn't tread on other people's toes&mdash;not so they'd
know it, even if you had to step over their heads. If
you only understand how, you can do what you please.
The style is all. Ah," continued Dashoff Uptosnuff, falling
into a philosophic reverie, "what a world of blunders
is this! They've got free schools and high schools, and
universities and colleges,&mdash;they learn to cipher&mdash;to read
languages&mdash;to understand mathematics and all sorts of
things&mdash;comparatively useless things&mdash;but who is taught
confidence&mdash;that neat kind of confidence which don't look
like confidence&mdash;who is taught to converse, when in that
lies all the civil engineering of life, which shaves the
mountain from our path, tunnels the rocks and lifts us to
the top of the social Alleghanies? Who learns at school
how to make a bow, or to get a wife with a hundred
thousand dollars or upwards? Where, in short, is that
professorship which shows us the road to success, and indicates
how we are to live without work, the great secret
at which we are all struggling to arrive? As things are
managed now, we are soldiers sent to the battle before
we have learned to tell one end of our muskets from the
other; and before we have discovered where to insert the

<!-- page 116 -->

load and where to place the priming, the war is over and
we are among the killed, wounded and missing. Isn't
it doleful?"</p>

<p>"Very," said Shiverton, mournfully.</p>

<p>"Well, now, for my part, I don't see the trouble," said
Mrs. Fitzgig; "why can't a man buck up?"</p>

<p>"Nor I," added Miss Jemima Fitzgig, who wanted to
be Mrs. something. "It is the easiest thing in the world
to get along, especially among ladies," and she glanced
tenderly at Mr. Dashoff Uptosnuff.</p>

<p>"You must make an effort, Shiverton&mdash;one plunge and
all will be over&mdash;go to Marygold's determined on boldness.
Sooner or later, you must begin. It is impossible
to dodge in this way for ever."</p>

<p>What a happy thing it would be if the determination
were the achievement&mdash;if "I will" were the consummation&mdash;if,
by one potent screw upon the organ of firmness,
the little troop of faculties which make up our identity,
could be wheeled into the unshrinking and impenetrable
Macedonian phalanx, and if there could be no uneasy intervention
of doubtful thoughts between the firm resolve
and its execution.</p>

<p>"I will," said Shiverton, and he did.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>He did&mdash;but how? Let us not anticipate. Let as
sooner pause before ringing up for the catastrophe of this
painful drama, and rather seek metaphysically to know
why it was a painful history and why it had a catastrophe&mdash;why
any of us have catastrophes&mdash;for catastrophe is
not necessary to our nature. If the faculties were in
equipoise, we should never fall&mdash;Shiverton Shakes would
not have fallen. We are, to a certain extent, rope-dancers
here below&mdash;Seiltanzers&mdash;Herr Clines; and there
is truth in the Mahommedan supposition that we cross the
gulf upon a bridge finer than a hair. Any internal force,

<!-- page 117 -->

therefore, in excess or in deficiency, swerves us from the
right line, and we run the risk of being impinged upon
an adverse catastrophical circumstance, having the melancholy
preferment of serving to point a moral and adorn
a tale. Our vices are our virtues running to riot and
pushing into the extreme, and all human impulses are
good, in subordination and in their place. It is their
morbid, unwholesome condition which makes our trouble.
There is no sinfulness in thirst, if the proper means are
used to quench it; nor is ambition unholy, if it only seeks
honourable and useful distinction among men. Acquisitiveness
is derided; but a subdued acquisitiveness is
requisite, if we would not be a burden to our friends and
subject old age to the degradation of being a charge upon
the public purse. Even anger&mdash;the combativeness and
destructiveness of modern definition&mdash;is essential to our
well-being, as a defensive means, and that the oppressor
may fear to set his heavy foot upon us. We are, in
short, good people enough in the constituents of our individuality&mdash;all
the materials are respectable in themselves;
it is the quantity of each which causes the disturbance.
Too much courage makes the bully&mdash;too little
shrinks into the coward. A modicum of self-esteem induces
us to scorn meanness&mdash;with too large a share, our
pride becomes an insult and an outrage. The love of
approval gives amiability to our deportment; but it may
run into perking vanity and ambling affectation. Happy
they "whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,"
that they can march with a steady step and
have no reason for pausing analysis to learn why they
stumble.</p>

<p>Now the psychological ship of Shakes&mdash;the vessel
which carried this C&aelig;sar and his fortunes&mdash;was defective
in its trim&mdash;the ballast was badly stowed&mdash;too much by
the head or too much something else, which prevented

<!-- page 118 -->

it from working "shipshape and Bristol fashion." His
deference to "other people" had been nourished to an
extent which cast a destructive shadow over his other
faculties, and his firmness and self-reliance had probably
left hollows in his pericranium. But it was not altogether
that he placed no sufficient estimate upon himself&mdash;there
were times&mdash;times apart&mdash;times of retiracy, when he felt
"as good as you"&mdash;perhaps better, and it may be that it
was an overweening desire to fill out his fancy sketch of
himself&mdash;to be a sublime Shakes&mdash;the embodiment of
his own conception&mdash;which gave such paralyzing force
to the eye of the observer&mdash;that "Mrs. Grundy" whose
criticism we all fear, more or less, and made him either
shrink from the effort, or fail miserably when he did venture
on the attempt. Was it at all thus with Shakes?
There are such apparent contradictions in humanity.
But who is "clairvoyant" enough to penetrate into the
mental council-chamber, and discover what we scarce
know ourselves?</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>It was cold and dark, but yet a man in a cloak walked
uneasily up and down the street. Lights beamed from
the windows and carriages drove up to the door of a mansion,
upon which his earnest regards seemed to be fixed.</p>

<p>"Now, I will," said he, pausing under the trees; "no,
not yet&mdash;I can wait a little while longer.</p>

<p>"I wish it was to-morrow, or some time next week,"
muttered he. "I wish I was a chimney-sweep, for they
are all a-bed&mdash;I wish I was that limping fellow with a
bad cold, crying oysters&mdash;he don't wear white kids&mdash;I
almost wish I had an attack of apoplexy, and somebody
was rolling me along on a wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>"Now for it!" and he dashed desperately up the steps
and seized the bell-handle with unflinching fingers&mdash;but

<!-- page 119 -->

he did not pull&mdash;like the renowned "King of France,"
he walked gently down again.</p>

<p>"I think I should like a little hot whisky punch,"
sighed he; "very strong whisky, and remarkable hot
punch."</p>

<p>It is an anti-temperance weakness, no doubt; but still
there are passages in most men's lives when they feel the
very want expressed by Shiverton Shakes&mdash;when they
would "like a punch"&mdash;a strong punch&mdash;to make them
go. But such punches are apt to become bad punches&mdash;to
punch out one's brains. If you cannot get along without
punch, you had better not go at all.</p>

<p>"But no&mdash;who's afraid?&mdash;Uptosnuff will laugh if I
don't&mdash;here goes!" and the bell rang loudly.

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Shiverton Shakes had committed an error&mdash;nothing
daunts a man of his infirmity more than unaccustomed
garments. One who is at ease in a familiar coat, feels
embarrassed in a new dress. Shakes had caused his hair
to be curled&mdash;it pulled in every direction. His white
gloves were rather of the tightest&mdash;his satin stock had
not yet the hang of his neck&mdash;his pumps uncomfortably
usurped the place of his expanded boots&mdash;his coat had
only come home that afternoon. He had practised to
dance, but it was not a full dress rehearsal. His white
waistcoat and his snowy gloves were ever in his eye;
he saw himself continually, and there is nothing worse
than to see one's self, under circumstances of restraint&mdash;to
be reminded all the time that yourself is there. Shiverton
had that species of consciousness which poetic souls
have attributed to the poker. He felt like a catapult,
without hinge or joint. He was cold at the extremities.</p>

<p>"If nobody knew me, I wouldn't care so much,"
quoth he.</p>

<!-- page 120 -->

<p>But Uptosnuff was unexpectedly there&mdash;there before
him.</p>

<p>"Now, Shiverton&mdash;your respects to the hostess&mdash;graceful
and rather affectionate."</p>

<p>"I wish he hadn't said that," growled Shiverton, as
he made his way, as if travelling on eggs, through the
gayly dressed throng to Mrs. Marygold, who stood in all
the splendors of matronly embellishment.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Marygold&mdash;I'm very&mdash;how d'ye&mdash;hope you're&mdash;good
evening&mdash;how's&mdash;yes, ma'am," ejaculated Shiverton,
spasmodically.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! Shiverton! rejoiced to see you," said Mr.
Marygold, a jocular gentleman, with a mulberry nose;
"got over your bashfulness, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;e&mdash;s," responded Shiverton, with a mechanical
effort at a smile, in which the mouth went into attitude,
curving toward the ears, while the rest of the face kept
its rigid, stony appearance.</p>

<p>"Glad of it&mdash;plenty of pretty girls here&mdash;come, let me
make you acquainted."</p>

<p>"No, thank you&mdash;I'd rather&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now's your time, Shiverton," whispered Uptosnuff,
"keep it up&mdash;don't flinch."</p>

<p>"Mr. Shakes, bashful Mr. Shakes, Miss Simpkins&mdash;very
desirous of dancing with you. Didn't you say so?"
observed the jocular Mr. Marygold.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;yes&mdash;I&mdash;oh!&mdash;very&mdash;it's getting warm," and
Shiverton Shakes sat forcibly down upon the elderly Mrs.
Peachblossom, who shrieked aloud, while Shakes sprang
up with amazement: "just as I expected&mdash;right on somebody's
toe!"</p>

<p>"Never mind&mdash;persevere," whispered Uptosnuff.
"Nobody's hurt. Now be bold&mdash;it's much easier than
being timid."</p>

<p>"I will," said Shiverton, drawing down his waistcoat;

<!-- page 121 -->

<p>"I will&mdash;keep near me, but don't look at me&mdash;"
and Shiverton led his partner to the dance, resolved at
all hazards to try the advice of his friend. But when the
dance began, he suddenly felt as if ten thousand eyes were
upon him&mdash;his little knowledge of the subject, picked up
"long time ago," deserted from his memory. It was all
confusion, and every attempt to guide his erratic steps
made the confusion worse confounded. "Now, Mr.
Shakes"&mdash;"there, Mr. Shakes," and "here, Mr. Shakes,"
only served to mystify his perceptions still more deeply,
as, driven to desperate courses, he danced frantically
about, in the vain hope that lucky chance might put him
upon that undiscovered and apparently undiscoverable
clue to the labyrinth, to which, it was plain, direction
could not lead him.</p>

<p>"Whew!&mdash;Uptosnuff," panted Shiverton, during a
prelude to a new complication of dance and suffering,&mdash;when
the tamborine rang out, and when the yellow man
in ear-rings was evidently inhaling volumes of the atmosphere,
to aid him in calling figures in that as yet unknown
tongue and untranslated language which dancers alone
comprehend. "Uptosnuff, I can't stand this&mdash;what
shall I do?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell&mdash;did you ever try to faint?" replied
Uptosnuff.</p>

<p>"Yah-yay&mdash;doo yandleming foo-yay!" shouted the
yellow man in ear-rings.</p>

<p>"Jang-jingle&mdash;r-a-a-n-g foodie," said the tamborine.</p>

<p>"Shaw-shay!"</p>

<p>If Shiverton could have reached the yellow man, there
would have been an end to the ear-rings; but as this
was out of the question, he shut his eyes and set his arms
and legs in action with an unlimited power of attorney,
and, though he went many ways, it happened, with a
perversity peculiar to Terpsichorean tyros, that he never

<!-- page 122 -->

hit upon the right way, at the right time; for, in these
matters, the right soon becomes wrong.</p>

<p>The company began to gather round, to witness this
extraordinary and extemporaneous performance.</p>

<p>" 'Pon my soul, if I don't think it's animal magnetism,"
remarked a scientific looking individual, with a bald head
and green spectacles. He's mesmerized&mdash;he's under
the influence of the fluid."</p>

<p>"I wish I was," thought Shiverton, as he bounded
like a kangaroo, catching his rearward foot in the flowing
robes of Miss Simpkins, and oversetting the "one lady
forward," as he himself came lumbering to the floor.</p>

<p>All was chaos.</p>

<p>"Intoxicated!"</p>

<p>"Insane!"</p>

<p>"Insufferable!"</p>

<p>"Infamous!"</p>

<p>"Satisfaction!" said whiskers.</p>

<p>Shiverton scrambled to his feet, and stared wildly
around.</p>

<p>"Shiverton Shakes, I never could have believed that
you would have come to my house, in such a condition,"
said Mrs. Marygold, in awful tones.</p>

<p>"Shiverton Shakes, I've done with you for ever," said
the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"My friend will wait on you in the morning," remarked
whiskers.</p>

<p>"Beat a retreat, Shiverton&mdash;you're Waterloo'd," hinted
Uptosnuff. "<i>Sauve qui peut</i>. It's too late to faint
now&mdash;why didn't you lie still, to be picked up?"</p>

<p>Shiverton charged like a conscript of the French republic,
without much science, but with inflexible will, at
what he thought to be an open door&mdash;it was a costly
mirror; but, though a deceptive appearance, it did not
"take him in"&mdash;he rebounded, amid the crash of glass.

<!-- page 123 -->

Shrieks of dismay arose on every side; but Shiverton,
having now a clearly defined object in view, "bent up
each corporal agent to this terrible feat," and overthrew
all impediment, including stout Mrs. Marygold and sundry
other obstacles which were in the way of his recoil, to
say nothing of John with the refreshments, who was thus
deluged in lemonade, and the cabman at the door, who
was summarily taught how to execute a backward summerset
down a flight of steps.</p>

<p>Shiverton reached home, breathless, hatless, cloakless,
and in despair&mdash;a melancholy example of the perilous
consequences of endeavouring to "assume a virtue, if you
have it not."</p>

<p>"A man must be brought up to it," soliloquized Shiverton,
when he had recovered coolness enough to think,
and had kicked his kid gloves indignantly into a corner;
"at least, I'm sure that this spontaneous combustion sort
of way of going at it, will never answer for me. If I
could now, little by little, just dip in a foot&mdash;wet my
head&mdash;slide in gradually&mdash;become accustomed and acquainted
by degrees, and not be spoken to or bothered at
first&mdash;begin where I wasn't known, or where people don't
laugh at every thing so confoundedly. But no&mdash;I'm
done for&mdash;this blow up at Marygold's&mdash;I can never show
my head again," and he buried himself in the blankets,
as if he never more wished to be looked upon by the
surrounding world.</p>

<p>This was the first and last attempt of Shiverton Shakes
to gain a footing in society. He held no more intercourse
with Dashoff Uptosnuff; for, although he admitted the
correctness of that individual's theory, still he had an
overwhelming consciousness of inability to carry it into
effect. He bought him a turning lathe, and made knick-knacks
in the long winter evenings, smoked cigars, and
tried to read "Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman

<!-- page 124 -->

Empire." He would have liked to have a wife, but the
process of getting one was too much for his nervous sensibilities;
so he dined at an ordinary and made his own
tea and toast, being literally and truly an "unexpressed
idea"&mdash;an undeveloped capability.</p>

<p>THE BOYS THAT RUN WITH THE ENGINE.</p>

</div>

<p>WE are deceived. There is not so much inequality of
talent as the world supposes. From the earliest ages,
there has been a conspiracy of caste, to blind and to mislead
the mass of mankind, by giving a monopoly of fame
to those who stand in certain positions. To all the rest,
renown has been denied, and they have been content
with a lot, not inevitable, but cunningly imposed; and
thus the world, at every period, has been converted into
a crowd of "stupid starers"&mdash;shouters for self-constituted
idols, when, if the truth were known, thousands of those
who submit to be lookers-on, and to be shut from the
historic page altogether, not only possess genius equal to
that of the hero, but, actually, albeit in an humbler field,
give unhonoured manifestations of superior ability. The
difference is, that one man is framed, gilded, and hung
up against the wall, to be looked at and admired, while
another plods along the dusty highway, without attracting
notice. An accident has been wanting. A concurrence
of circumstances has brought about greatness in one
instance, when, in the other, the individual did not happen
to be within range of the breeze of fortune at the
proper moment; and hence, his sails flap idly against the
mast, while the happier ship proudly careers across the
seas. Luck may not be a very euphonical word; but
there is much in luck. Instances of course arise, in
which the individual has not the innate force to improve
his luck, and is, therefore, rather overwhelmed than benefitted
by it. If a man be crank, and lack ballast, he is
swamped by the prosperous gale; but there are many
others who lag behind, only because they need the external

<!-- page 126 -->

impetus which has been fatal to him. If, then,
any one stands before our eyes, sparkling with reputation
and glittering with glory&mdash;like Gesler's cap upon a pole,
to which all are required to bow&mdash;let us shade our eyes
from the effulgence, and do honour rather to the luck,
than to him who has been the subject of it. Let us enquire
whether it has been his own strength of limb, or
the brawny muscle of propitious fortune, which has
borne him up the steep, and let us pay our respects
accordingly.</p>

<p>Glory, in the main, is a delusion. It is too often rather
a concession on our part, than a merit in him to whom it
is accorded. It is not so much the talent we admire, as
the chance which gave room for its exhibition. The
same elements of character might be at our side for a lifetime,
and receive no appreciation. It is only when they
are successfully displayed in the arena peculiarly dedicated
to glory, that our wonder is moved. The dexterity
of a Talleyrand may retail dry goods, but who writes the
history of him that wields a yard-stick? The strategic
talent of a Napoleon may be evinced in robbing the
"watermillion" patches of New Jersey; but where is the
O'Meara to note the sayings of one who expiates his
offences in a county jail? Humanity is unjust to itself.
If genius be the thing to be admired, why should it command
our homage more readily when attired in feathers
and embroidery, than when skulking in rags and tatters?
Are the constituents of heroism less worthy when their
owner is in the hands of a constable, than when he is incarcerated
in an island prison like St. Helena? Never
credit it. We are fools to our false views and erroneous
estimates. We are struck by the circumstance, and not
by the essential. The ragamuffin's head has not been
adorned with a laurel wreath&mdash;he never, perhaps, caused
an illumination, except when dragged from his thieving

<!-- page 127 -->

ambush in the coal-hole, by the light of a single candle;&mdash;but
analyze his actions, put his motives and his achievements
into the crucible of philosophic reflection, and then
determine whether, in a happier sphere, he would not
have stolen "crowns" where he now filches shillings,
and have appropriated empires, instead of "hooking"
boots from an entry. Is it not true, then, that we esteem
the lucks and chances of a man, much more than we
reverence the man himself? Why, even when hero
meets hero, he receives the applause who carries off the
victory, when it is plainly apparent that accident alone
was decisive of the conflict. A chance shot disables the
frigate,&mdash;the bugler is killed, and does not call "boarders
to repel boarders,"&mdash;an aid-de-camp fails to convey
orders,&mdash;a Grouchy does not bring up the reserve in
time,&mdash;the success is determined by some petty failure in
the details of a masterpiece of skill, and he is hailed the
great one who stumbles into triumph. Blind luck draws
the bow-string round the neck of genius, and the goose
pecks out the eyes of the eagle.</p>

<p>The same injustice prevails throughout. Why should
familiarity breed contempt, but that we have what may
be called a proclivity to humbug&mdash;a disposition to be
deceived? And yet it will always be found, that no man
is a hero to his valet-de-chambre&mdash;no, nor to his wife, his
children, or his friends, except in some rare instances.
Who can believe that Peter, by our side,&mdash;Peter, whom
we have known from childhood upwards,&mdash;Peter, whom
we have rebuked, rebuffed and perhaps cuffed,&mdash;who can
think that Peter is a genius? And why not Peter?&mdash;who
is inevitably better than Peter? Warriors and statesmen?
They were not born warriors and statesmen. They were
once little Peters, probably Peters not so promising as
yours. Scurvy little Peters, crying on the stairs&mdash;rebuked,
rebuffed and cuffed, no doubt, like him. But we

<!-- page 128 -->

know Peter&mdash;know him too well, and seem to lose the
power of appreciation by that intimate knowledge; and in
this respect, as in all others, it is distance and ignorance
combined, which creates our astonishment. Thus it is,
indeed, that they err, who wish to see the great ones
close at hand; and thus the great ones err, who suffer
themselves unnecessarily to be seen close at hand. He
who really desires to enjoy the enchantment of the drama,
is not wise in thrusting himself behind the scenes. The
tyrant does not become more awful, when it is observed
that his portentous moustache and terrific eye-brow are the
product of a burnt cork; nor are the dancing-girls a whit
more full of fascination, when it appears that their roseate
blushes are the quintessence of brick-dust. And what
literary lion is there, in the long list of those who have
visited our shores, who did not lose his mane by the adventure?&mdash;who
did not sink in public estimation, and
gradually decline from the majesty of a quadruped, into
the ordinary two-legged condition of the indigenous man?
Where, in fact, is the exception? Not one. Familiarity
is the "Lion King." It reduces all such rampant creatures
to the mere household standard, and puts them to
sleep before the fire.</p>

<p>But all these things are nevertheless wrong. Genius
is genius, whether the chance be afforded or not;&mdash;it is
still genius, and the same genius, whether its field be
small or great;&mdash;it is genius, notwithstanding, however
close it may be in our intimacy, and the truth of our prelude
may be demonstrated in all its branches, by a slight
recurrence to the history of "The Boys that run with the
Engine."</p>

<p>They are but imperfect observers of human nature, who
look abroad and look upwards, to note character in its
more striking developments. If their study is man, the
true materials for research are best found close at hand.

<!-- page 129 -->

History is a falsifier. All actions, when viewed from a
distance, are seen through a distorting medium. The
so-called chronicles of the times, are but the mirage of
the desert, in which the parties represented often appear
upside down, one swelling to a gigantic stature, while
another dwindles to dwarfish proportions. Motives are
mistaken and results are exaggerated, and he who hopes,
in this way, to arrive at knowledge through the medium
of written records, must, by dint of preparatory study on
the living subject, have learned to separate the reality
from the fictitious. Cabinets and camps are well enough,
to be sure, if we are on our guard against the deceptive
glare which is almost invariably thrown around them&mdash;if
we are gifted with that rare discrimination which considers
the man himself, and not his embroidery; but, in
the generality of cases, it is our weakness to regard as
fine birds, all poultry which has been lucky enough to
trig itself out in fine feathers, and hence we are led into
errors innumerable,&mdash;our swans are geese, and the turkey
is often degraded to the rank of a buzzard. If, however,
we turn from courts and camps and cabinets, to the
engine houses of a great metropolis, we shall there find
action, and the springs to action,&mdash;action as energetic,
and the springs to action as forcible, as are to be seen
any where,&mdash;laid open to our view, without gilding and
without guile. Here is manhood in its opening flower,&mdash;in
the summer morning of its restlessness. The untrimmed
colt of aspiring ambition prances upon this plain;
a colt which may hereafter be the war-horse, with his
neck clothed in thunder&mdash;a more striking adornment,
as must readily be admitted, than even one of Tennent's
best fitting stocks, in all the glory of shining satin.
Diplomacy may perhaps be expanding in this group,
little restrained by the weak embraces of a thread-bare
jacket, and, by its side, stands that emulation, which

<!-- page 130 -->

may lead to the pinnacle of fame, though at present content
with carrying a torch, with bearing the massive
weight of a branch-pipe, with having the head of a rope,
or with having the hand of control upon the tongue of
the carriage. All propelling qualities are developed
here, and "the boys that run with the engine" have
within them every faculty necessary, in a more polished
condition, for the conduct of an empire.</p>

<p>And it is for these reasons, that "the boys that run
with the engine," are deemed worthy of being sketched
by the cunning hand of the artist, and of having their
mental characteristics pourtrayed in an essay especially
devoted to the subject. Fastidious refinement may turn
its head aside in scorn, to luxuriate upon the historical
novel or the metaphysical romance, to contemplate representations
of man as he is not, and of woman as she ought
not to be; but these things are passing away, and it is to
be the glory of our time to "catch the manners living as
they rise,"&mdash;to look upon nothing as beneath its notice
which contributes to modify the dispositions of the
age.</p>

<p>Who, let us ask, is more of a "feature" in the countenance
of the times, as they exist hereabouts, than these juvenile
Rosicrucians&mdash;these Ghebers&mdash;these modern Fire-worshippers?
Who stand out more prominently on the
face of things than they who, by night and by day, sweep
like the wind along the streets, and, by their obstreperous
clamour, prevent even echo from indulging in a protracted
nap? Who are more active, more courageous, more
constantly on the alert,&mdash;who make more noise in the
world, or force their way more readily through every
obstruction, causing all people and all things to give way
before them, than "the boys that run with the engine?"
Who are more frequently heard, more often felt, or more
continually seen than these skimmers of the street, and

<!-- page 131 -->

are they not to find a place in the portraiture of the period?
It would be a gross dereliction of duty to suffer them to
pass unheeded.</p>

<p>The "spirit of fire," which early seizes upon a considerable
portion of the youth of cities, is so far from
being properly subject to those who have that limited
species of control over them, which is accorded to parents
and guardians, that perhaps it may be said, there is no
other branch of insubordination which causes so much
trouble and uneasiness. To the "boss," whose apprentices
have reached the state of development necessary for
the reception of the fever, an alarm of fire is a perfect
horror&mdash;not because his sympathies with the probable
sufferer are excessive&mdash;not because he mourns over the
ragings of the destructive element; but because he knows
that, under such circumstances, his authority is neutralized
and negatived&mdash;that his influence is so far gone that
"moral suasion" will not keep his boys to their work,
and that, if he expects that the shop is not to be left to
take care of itself, he must prevent its depopulation by
bringing the strong arm in play. To lock the door is
not sufficient, while windows remain practicable, and
even should the windows be hermetically sealed, egress
by the chimney would not be thought too much of a feat
to meet the call of paramount duty. Should the alarm
come in the night, it is in vain that the "old man"&mdash;all
superiors are "old men," in modern phraseology, and our
standing in that respect is measured by rank, not years&mdash;has
made all fast and gone chuckling to bed, with the key
under his pillow. He forgets that sheds and fences and
out-houses are as available to intrepidity as a staircase, and
that "the boy that runs with the engine" can travel over
the exterior of a house with as little embarrassment as if
the laws of gravitation exercised no influence over him&mdash;that,
with his jacket under his arm and his boots slung

<!-- page 132 -->

about his neck, no denizen of the forest can run up perpendiculars
more cleverly than he; and, while the aforesaid
"boss" notes the heavy eyes and nodding heads
which hang during the day so listlessly over their task,
he never arrives at the true secret until he discovers that
"there was a fire last night." Little did he dream&mdash;poor
unsuspicious soul!&mdash;when the midnight bell struck
on his ear, and he turned him again to sleep, after ascertaining
the key to be safe in its snug position&mdash;that Tom
and Dick and Ben, and all the rest, were off in triumph,
and that the energies which should have been expended
in his service, according to the articles of apprenticeship,
had been exhausted in extinguishing far distant flames.
He never thought that those hoarse yells, which broke his
rest with momentary dismay, emanated from most familiar
voices, nor that the unintelligible, but none the less fearful
on that account, "waugh-baugh-wulla-balloo!" which
sounded so dreadfully before his door, mingled with the
clanging of the bell and the fitful glancing of torches, was
a derisive cry, uttered for his especial edification, by one
of those whom he believed still to be slumbering in the
garret. Nor when at breakfast time, he told the lads how
loud was the alarm last night, and how the signal indicated
that the danger lay "nor-west," did he mark the
cunning wink which stole from eye to eye, in mockery
of the ignorance that would give them information upon
a subject so familiar. Why the lads are all so harsh in
their tones, he cannot imagine, unless it be that the influenza
is about; but he does think that the variety of soil
upon their boots, indicates the fact of more previous travel
than he was aware of. At such times also, there are apt
to be unaccountable deficiencies in the quantity of cold
provisions in the cellar, which are scarcely to be attributed
to the gastronomic performances of a single cat. The
amateur fireman, on the return from service, is apt to

<!-- page 133 -->

feel the calls of appetite, and as he is, as it were, a principle
essential to the well-being of real estate, he takes
due care to nourish himself accordingly.</p>

<p>The learned may not perhaps have taken due cognisance
of the fact, but, in some divisions of knowledge,
the extent of information obtained by "the boys that run
with the engine," is well calculated to move our wonder.
The amount of their acquaintance with local topography,
qualifies them to write articles for the Encyclopedia.
Not a court, lane or alley&mdash;not a hole nor a corner, in the
vast circumference of the town, which is not considerably
more familiar to them than a glove. They are the Plutarchs
of fire-plugs, knowing the history of each, and the
comparative merits of all. At every conflagration within
their experience, they can tell what engines were in service,
what hose companies had "attachments," and how
many feet of hose were brought in play&mdash;who was earliest
on the ground, and obtained the most effective position,
with many other particulars with which the world, greatly
to its disadvantage, is never likely to become conversant.
If it were the nature of "the boys" to write, the annals
of the parish, as they would record them, could not fail
to form a whole library in itself.</p>

<p>On the score of emulation too, these lads are not to be
surpassed by the most ambitious of ancient or modern
times. Other people are regardful of creature comforts.
They will break away from the most interesting employment,
because dinner is ready, or because the hour has
come when they are in the habit of imbibing tea. When
the time arrives for going to bed, they cease from their
labours and get them to repose. They are slaves to
routine, and must travel continually in the accustomed
circle, or they are wretched in proportion to the extent to
which they have deviated; but it is not so with "the
boys that run with the engine." The eccentricity is their

<!-- page 134 -->

delight. Rest, sleep, food, are nothing to them when
weighed in the balance with the pleasure of dragging a
heavy machine through the mud; and, that they may be
first at the engine house, they have often been known, on
the frostiest night, to leap from their warm couches,
rushing forth with their garments in a bundle, to dress
when they had reached their destination. Can disinterestedness,
generous emulation and glowing ambition,
attain a more exalted climax than this? It does not lie
within the range of possibility, and the higher value will
be affixed to it, when it is remembered that many of
these "young youths" have quite another character in the
more ordinary affairs of life. In matters of mere domestic
concernment, they who will labour so strenuously in the
cause of the engine, are, in frequent instances, found to be
in no way addicted to excessive exertion. A night alarm
will draw those from their beds, who are not easily enticed
therefrom at the call of business; and the most
lethargic lounger that ever dozed when he should have
been waking, or that ever skulked when work was at
hand, will cheerfully encounter any toil, if it happen to be
connected with the duties of the hose house.</p>

<p>The leading characteristic, however, of the class to
which we refer, is valour&mdash;enterprise, energy and valour.
Where could a nobler combination be discovered?
Next to a fire, the most glorious object to their view, is
a fight. But when both unite&mdash;when a fight is found at
a fire, and when the fire lights the way to a fight, who
are happier than "the boys that run with the engine?"
And reason good, if it be true that martial heroism is a
matter worthy of our aspirations. The elements of war
conjoin. The flames crackle&mdash;the fierce hurrah goes up&mdash;columns
charge&mdash;the heavy artillery comes lumbering
through the press&mdash;shrieks, groans, imprecations and denunciations,
are mingled thick with blows and thrusts.

<!-- page 135 -->

The glittering trumpet takes the place of the flashing
sabre, and quick as lightning, cuts "six" upon the head
and shoulders of the foe, stretching him senseless in the
kennel. The massive "spanner" makes short work of
the stoutest tarpaulin, and though the combatants may
long for the bullet, yet those who have had much experience
in the force of projectiles, have discovered that but
for the name of the thing, brickbats are likely to answer
just as well. All the joy of conflict is called forth in
such a field. It is not the distant and cold-blooded courtesy
of scientific man&oelig;uvre, where legs usurp the prerogative
of arms&mdash;it is the forlorn hope, the escalade, the
storm, the hand-to-hand engagement, developing "the
worth of the individual" and giving scope to personal
prowess&mdash;this is what invests it with fascination for the
engine boy; and what more could be accomplished, even
at a Waterloo, than to be picked up for dead and carried
home on a shutter? The essentials of glory are every
one attainable in such a struggle, and it is but that short-sightedness
on the part of the world, to which we have
already alluded, which prevents the proper distribution
of praise. It is true that the scarred veteran obtains no
pension to compensate for his knocks; but does that argue
that they did not smart as much as wounds that are better
paid for? The victor receives neither title nor riband;
but, in all likelihood, he has been quite as cruel, brutal and
oppressive, to the extent of the opportunity, as if he were
honoured with both.</p>

<p>In all associations, whether of men, boys or sheep,
there is invariably a bell-wether&mdash;a master spirit; one
who affords colour to their modes of thought, and furnishes
aim for their actions&mdash;who warms their spirit when their
courage flags&mdash;who lends them enterprise when they
falter, and gives concentration to their efforts. In an extended
sphere, such individuals bestow character on nations

<!-- page 136 -->

and on ages, leaving their impress upon all, and, in
a more confined circle, the personal stamp, though not so
widely spread, is made with equal distinctness. In the
group which forms the subject of our story, such a one
will be seen in the person of Hickey Hammer,&mdash;he who
leans against the wall, with club in hand and with a most
majestic sternness in his countenance&mdash;he, with the game-cock
look all over him&mdash;he, whose combativeness and
destructiveness are so prominent as to render it unavoidable
to wear his hat aslant, that, on one side at least, these
organs may be comparatively cool, to ensure safety to his
friends&mdash;he, Hickey Hammer, who has fierceness enough
in his composition to furnish a whole menagerie, and yet
leave sufficient surplus to animate and constitute a warrior.
Were there ample swing for Hickey Hammer&mdash;had
we the delights of civil war, or the charms of a revolution,
there would be one more added to the list of
heroes, and another picture would figure in the print shops.
But as it is, Hickey contrives to find some vent for his
inspiration, by getting up a quarrel about once a day, and
nourishing it into a genial combat&mdash;otherwise, he would
explode from the attrition of his own fiery spirits. Hickey
Hammer "runs with the engine," because it goes to fight
fire, and he almost wishes that he were a bucket of water,
to grapple more directly with so fierce a foe. So irresistible
is his call to contend, that he is obliged to gratify
it, whether there be an object present or not. When he
goes to bed at night, or when he rises in the morning, the
exercise of his muscles is an invariable concomitant.
He strikes the air, parries imaginary blows, and passes
through all the action of a "heady fight," with an energy
that is really alarming. Every door in the house bears
the imprint of his knuckles, and the very tables are splintered
by the weight of his fist. The "cocked hat" is to
him the beau ideal of shapes, and he labours to knock all

<!-- page 137 -->

things into that antiquated resemblance. Should old time
venture within reach of his arm, the existing moment
would at once be converted, by a similar process, into
"the middle of next week."</p>

<p>It will be seen that one of his devoted admirers is endeavouring
to tell him a story about a Mr. Tompkins,
who had recently distinguished himself at a fire, and that
Hickey Hammer listens with his usual scornful impatience.</p>

<p>"Tompkins!" said Hickey, on the occasion referred
to; "well, and who is Tompkins, your great Tompkins?
Now I'll bring this thing to a pint at once; for when
there's so much talk, there's never a bit of fight."</p>

<p>"I didn't say any thing about fight," was the trembling
remonstrance of the admirer.</p>

<p>"But you cracked Tompkins up, didn't you, and
Tompkins pretends to be great shakes, don't he? What's
that but fight, I should like to know? Now the thing,
as I said before, is just this, and no more than
this. I don't pretend to be much; but can Tompkins
lick me? Could he lick me any way, fair stand up
and no closing in, or could he do it, rough and tumble
and no letting up? Talking about people is nonsense&mdash;this
is the how, to find out what a chap is good for.
Fetch on your Tompkins, and tie my right hand behind
me, if you like&mdash;that's all&mdash;yes, and he shall have six
cracks at me before I begin. I'm not particular about
odds. When you see this Tompkins, tell him so, and
ask if he or his big brother, if he has got one, or any of
the family, boss and all, would like to knock a chip off
my hat any afternoon. I'll clear them of the law. I
want them to do it&mdash;I'd give 'em something if they'd
do it. Just feel my arm&mdash;hickory and gum logs! Talk
of your Tompkinses! Who did they ever lick? I don't
even believe they were ever taken up because they were

<!-- page 138 -->

going to fight. Only wait till there's an alarm some
Sunday, and then show me Tompkins, if you want to see
a man forget what he had for dinner."</p>

<p>In fact, Hickey Hammer considers himself sent here on
a special mission, to accommodate all customers, and
whenever he hears of a new comer, his first inquiry is
as to the individual's appreciation of his own prowess&mdash;whether,
like Tompkins, "he thinks he can lick Hickey
Hammer." If he does think so, and ventures to say so,
why, Mr. Hammer sees to it that the difference of opinion
may be settled on the spot. So great is his love of truth,
that he cannot bear to leave any one in error upon a
point of such interest and importance. Had Hammer
lived in earlier times, he would have been the very flower
of chivalry&mdash;at present, he only rejoices in the distinction
of being "a bird."</p>

<p>When squabbles are scarce and riots are a little out of
fashion, such events being somewhat epidemic, Mr.
Hammer, following the example of other great men,
makes the circumstance to suit himself, and, gathering a
flock of pupils and proselytes around him, often sets forth
on what he calls the "grand rounds." This process consists
in taking an evening ramble from one engine house
to another, to have a glance at the collection of boys
there assembled; for each establishment has its separate
set of votaries, who believe that all virtue resides in their
gang, and that all excellence is combined in their engine.
If there are enough present to render the scene impressive,
Hickey Hammer sternly confronts the strangers, and, with
a lowering aspect, thus addresses them:</p>

<p>"Well, my lads, where's the bully?"</p>

<p>"What bully?" is the natural response, from those who
are yet to be indoctrinated into Mr. Hammer's mode of
doing business.</p>

<p>"I want to see the bully of this company&mdash;you've got

<!-- page 139 -->

a bully, I suppose. Everybody says so. Where is he?
Tell him to come to supper," and, that there may be no
mistake as to his meaning, Hickey throws himself into
position, dealing forth experimental blows in the very
face of the bystanders, so nicely calculated as to distance,
that they are enabled to feel the "whiff and wind," without
experiencing personal detriment, the insult being
assault enough, though rather constructive than positive,
and having no taint of battery.</p>

<p>If a bully be forthcoming, which is not often the case
upon an emergency so sudden and unexpected, the consequences
are obvious. The combat either comes off at
once, or is fixed for a more convenient spot and a subsequent
meeting. But, should the assailed party be without
a champion, Hickey challenges any two, or more, if
they like to undertake him, and this mode of proceeding
generally results in a set-to all round, requiring a constabulary
suppression, and furnishing material for many a
tale of traditionary narrative, in which Hickey Hammer
figures as the hero; in consequence whereof, all "the
boys that run with the engine," of which Hickey Hammer
may be regarded as the patron, are Hickey Hammerites
in word and deed. They roll their trowsers up
higher than other boys&mdash;they roar louder than other
boys; they take the engine out on Sundays, and, if they
cannot get a fight in any other way, they dash deliberately
into every "carriage" that passes. Rare boys are "the
boys that run with the engine"&mdash;the choice and master-spirits
of the time.</p>

<p>JACK SPRATTE'S REVENGE.</p>

<p class="small">A PISCATORIAL EPISODE.</p>

</div>

<p>DO you know Mrs. Brownstout? Everybody ought
to know Mrs. Brownstout; for Mrs. Brownstout is in the
market&mdash;not for sale&mdash;matrimonially speaking, her market
was made long ago, and thence was derived the
hearty appellation in which she rejoices. But, as she
occupies a conspicuous stand in the Fish Market, it is
therefore presumed that everybody knows Mrs. Brownstout,
who presides over the eventful destinies of shad
and "pearch" and rockfish. That is, they know her
"superfishally," if we may be allowed the expression&mdash;in
her commodities and in her outward appearance.
When she passes by, they possess that degree of acquaintance
with her exterior, to enable them to say "there goes
Mrs. Brownstout;" and when she is seated at her stand&mdash;strange
perversity of human nature, that it is always sure
to sit at its stand!&mdash;people are positive that it is really
Mrs. Brownstout. They recognise her by her gait, or
by her costume, or by the piscatorial circumstances that
surround her, which is about as much as the world in
general knows of any body. But the moral Mrs. Brownstout&mdash;the
historical Mrs. Brownstout&mdash;the metaphysical
Mrs. Brownstout&mdash;in short, the spiritual Mrs. Brownstout,
as contra-distinguished from the apparent Mrs. Brownstout,
who merely sells her fishes and takes your money,
why, what does society at large know of her? To the
popular eye, she counts one in the sum total of humanity&mdash;a
particle, and nothing more, in the vast conglomeration
of the breathing universe. There is no perception
of her mental identity&mdash;her intellectual idiosyncrasy

<!-- page 141 -->

attracts no attention&mdash;her past and her future are not inquired
into&mdash;the Mrs. Brownstout retrospective, and the
Mrs. Brownstout prospective, are equally disregarded, so
that those ambitious of shad may find her to be the Mrs.
Brownstout present; and thus the life of this estimable
lady, like the lives of most of us, is narrowed down to
the single point of immediate action&mdash;she and we are
important only when it happens that our services are
wanted. Our story&mdash;who has not got a story?&mdash;all our
beings, doings and sufferings&mdash;our loves, hopes, successes
and disappointments&mdash;all the trouble we have taken&mdash;the
vexations we have endured&mdash;the triumphs we have
achieved&mdash;who that encounters us in the street, ever thinks
of them, or reflects that each of us, as we pass on our
winding way, is a volume of exquisite experiences, bound
in calf, and well worthy of the closest perusal? Not one,
of all the vast multitude which throngs the path; and
hence it is that the world, collectively considered, is more
distinguished by folly than by wisdom, learning nothing
from the problems that have already been solved, but
preferring to stumble onward, from the beginning to the
end, without borrowing a ray of light from the lanterns of
those who have gone before.</p>

<p>But it has been resolved that Mrs. Brownstout shall not
be sacrificed in this unceremonious manner&mdash;that some
passages of her existence shall be snatched from oblivion,
to amuse or instruct, as the case may be, at least a portion
of those into whose hands our pages may be destined
to fall. For Mrs. Brownstout, notwithstanding the energetic
expression of the outward woman, has had her
share of the disasters which seem inevitable to the susceptible
temperament. She, too, has had her "trials of the
heart," and has felt that though the poets seem to think
that the sphere of young love's gambols is chiefly located
"among the roses," he may yet exercise much potency

<!-- page 142 -->

when playing among the fishes. There is no scale armour
against the darts of Cupid, and, however steeled against
such impressions the fair one may be, it is found, sooner
or later, that she falls a prey to the tender passion.</p>

<p>It is an admitted fact, made evident by repeated observation,
that this world is full of people&mdash;men people and
women people&mdash;and that there are some among both,
who set out and travel to a considerable distance on their
earthly journey, upon the self-sustaining principle of
celibacy, in a heroic effort not to be bothered with appendages,
forgetting that, by a singular provision of
nature, their proper condition is that of being bothered,
and that, though they cannot see it, they must be bothered,
to be at all comfortable. When we are alone, we are not
bothered; yet who likes to be alone?</p>

<p class="small">"Better dwell in the midst of alarms,<br/>

Than reign in this horrible place,"</p>

<p>said Selkirk, in default of the noise of children and of his
wife's "alarms," and Selkirk had learned that stagnation
is a tiresome piece of work. A few of those, to whom
reference is made, protract their restless and uneasy experiment
of trying to live a quiet unperplexed life, in
which they are unquiet, and very much perplexed, until
the period for all human experiment is over. But the
great majority fail for lack of nerve, and retract, from a
late discovery of the truth. Your Benedicks and Beatrices
are almost sure to participate in the lot of those delineated
by the first of dramatists&mdash;they are certain, somehow or
other, to sink into the very calamity against which they
formerly protested, and, in an unguarded hour, malignant
fate delights to betray them to the common weakness.</p>

<p>To some extent, it was the fortune of Mrs. Brownstout
to be a living illustration of the truth of this principle. In
her maiden days. Miss Felicia Phinney laughed at the
importunities of her numerous admirers. Having early

<!-- page 143 -->

gone into the fish business, she was confident in her own
resources, and felt but little disposed to sink to a secondary
place in the firm; and, therefore, "the gentlemen in
waiting" each experienced a rebuff, so sharply administered,
that they were but little disposed to put themselves
again in the way of being similarly astonished&mdash;as she
had a method of conducting herself little calculated to
mollify the disappointment experienced upon such occasions.</p>

<p>One night&mdash;it was a lovely night, during a warm spell
which succeeded a "cold snap," in the early part of the
spring&mdash;shad were selling at seventy-five cents, and were
scarce at that&mdash;the moon shone sweetly upon the chimney-tops&mdash;the
fire-plugs, which were lucky enough to be on
the north side of the street, were tinged and tinted with
lines of fairy silver, and the beams of softened light played
with romantic effect upon the craggy sides and rough
fastnesses of the curb-stones. A balmy southern breeze
sighed through the streets and loitered round the corners
in lazy luxury, whispering soft nonsense in the ears of
the somnolent Charleys, as they dreamily indulged in
beatific visions of hot coffee and buckwheat cakes. All
nature, including the brickbats and paving-stones, seemed
to be wrapped in happy repose. The dogs barked not;
even the cats had ceased to be vocal, and when any of
these nocturnal wanderers appeared, it was plain from
their stealthy step and subdued deportment, that they, too,
felt the influence of the hour, and were unwilling to disturb
the magnificent but tranquil harmony of the picture.
It was, in short, a very fine night, particularly for the
season, and, though used by the undiscriminating, many
for the mere domestic purposes of snoring slumber, for
which the coarser kind of night would answer just as well,
yet this especial night was worthy of a more elevated
fate; and it may be regarded as a great pity that such

<!-- page 144 -->

nights as these do not come in the daytime, when they
would be better seen and more thoroughly admired&mdash;as
sleep, for the most part, is imperative, and as there are but
few of us who can manage its performance with our eyes
open.</p>

<p>The main object of nights of this description, taking it
for granted that every thing has its purpose, is to soften
the heart&mdash;to render it flexible, malleable, and susceptible
to the softer impressions. The sun, for instance, melts
the ice, and gives plasticity to many descriptions of candy;
but its warmest rays are ineffective, so far as the sympathies
of the soul are concerned. No one is apt to fall in
love at mid-day, or is much disposed to a declaration of
passion, at three o'clock of a sunny afternoon. Existence,
at these periods, is, in the main, altogether practical
and unimaginative&mdash;good enough, no doubt, for buying
and selling, and the eating of dinners; but not at all calculated
to elicit the poetry of the affections. Whereas
your moonlight evenings, when the frost is out of the
ground, play Prometheus to sentiment, and, when the
patient is not addicted to cigars and politics, both of which
are antagonistical to this species of refinement, are sure
to induce the bachelor to think that his condition is incomplete,
and that there are means by which he might
be made considerably happier. Thus it is that "our life
is twofold"&mdash;that before tea we are one person, and that
after this interesting event, we are somebody else.</p>

<p>It was on such an evening as we have attempted somewhat
elaborately to describe, and it was under such a
state of circumstances as we have incidentally alluded to,
that Jack Spratte escorted Miss Felicia Phinney home
from a tea party, given among themselves by the fish-merchants.
Jack Spratte had been as merry as a "grigge"
throughout the entertainment. He had danced and he
had sung&mdash;he had played "pawns" and "Copenhagen"&mdash;he

<!-- page 145 -->

had "sighed in a corner"&mdash;he had loved his love
with a "C," because she was "curious," "crusty" or
"crooked," and so forth; but still Jack Spratte was
heartwhole&mdash;sound as a roach, and as gracefully playful
as an eel. Jack Spratte, in that blind confidence for
which some men are remarkable, thought that the hook
had not yet been baited which was destined to discompose
the serenity of his gills, and that he was no catfish in a
pool, devoted to an early fry. He little dreamed that
celibacy is very "unsartin," and that the cork lines and
the lay-out lines, together with the dipsies, to say nothing
of the gilling seines, the floats and the scoop-nets, are
always about, and that the most innocent nibble may
result in a captivation.</p>

<p>Jack Spratte was strong in spirit when he stepped forth
from the festive hall, and crooked his dexter arm for the
accommodation of Miss Felicia Phinney. He was jocose
in his criticisms and observations for a square or two, and
he reviewed the sports of the evening with a degree of
humour which entitled him to rank with the wits of the
time. But the night was one not to be resisted, even by
Jack Spratte. He soon found that his chest&mdash;the chest
enclosing his susceptibilities&mdash;was not a safety chest,
not a fireproof asbestos chest, such as they roast under
cords of blazing hickory, and submit without damage to
vast conflagrations&mdash;but, on the contrary, though he
never suspected it before, rather a weak chest&mdash;he had
an oppression at the chest&mdash;in short, an affection of the
chest, resulting in a palpitation of the heart&mdash;and his
tongue became hard and dry, while there was a peculiar
whizzing in his ears, as if the "Ice-breaker" were suddenly
letting off steam. He stammered and he trembled.</p>

<p>"It can't be the punch," observed Jack Spratte, internally
to himself; "it can't be the punch that makes
me such a Judy. I didn't take enough of it for that&mdash;no,

<!-- page 146 -->

nor do I believe it is the fried oysters; for I put plenty
of Cayenne pepper and mustard on 'em."</p>

<p>No, Jack Spratte; it was neither the punch nor the
oysters. They are wronged by the suspicion. It was
the moonlight, chiefly, and Miss Felicia Phinney in the
second place. Amid the oysters, the punch and the
blazing lamps&mdash;amid the joke, the laugh and the song&mdash;yea,
even in the romp and in the redemption of pawns,
Jack Spratte was safe. But a walk into the air proved
fatal to him. The contrast was too much for his constitution,
like an icy draught on an August day. Mirth
often reacts into sensibility, and the liveliest strain easily
modulates into tenderness; just as extreme jocundity in a
child is but the prelude to a flood of tears.</p>

<p>Jack Spratte acted without premeditation, and instinctively
thought it wiser to begin afar off, and to approach
the subject by circumvallation. His first parallel was laid
as follows:</p>

<p>"Miss Phinney," said he, and his voice faltered as he
spoke, "Miss Phinney, don't you think that pearches is
good, but that rockfishes is nicer&mdash;better nor sunnies?"</p>

<p>"Why, every goose knows that," replied the lady,
forgetting, in her dislike to the professional allusion of
Spratte's remark, that geese are not particularly addicted
to fish&mdash;"but what are you talking about sich things now
for? We're not setting on the end of the wharf, I'd like
to know&mdash;are we?"</p>

<p>"No, we're not," hastily ejaculated Jack Spratte, who
felt that the crisis of his fate was at hand; "but oh, Miss
Phinney!&mdash;oh, Miss Felicia Phinney!&mdash;don't trifle with
my dearest affekshins&mdash;don't keep me a danglin' and a
kickin', with a big hook right through the gristle of my
nose!"</p>

<p>The figurative style in which passion is apt to indulge,
was strikingly manifest in Mr. Spratte's mode of expression;

<!-- page 147 -->

but it may well be doubted whether it operated in
a way likely to promote his cause.</p>

<p>"Well, if ever I heerd of sich a tarnal fool!" was Miss
Phimiey's unkind response; "Jack Spratte, I've not got
hold of your nose yet, whatever I may do if you keep
a cuttin' up in this crazy sort of way; and as for your
affekshins, take care there isn't kicks about your other
shins, which might hurt worse. Why&mdash;what&mdash;do&mdash;you
&mdash;mean&mdash;anyhow?" continued she, with great emphasis
and deliberation.</p>

<p>"I mean," gasped Jack Spratte, so overcome by the
contending emotions of love and fear, that he was constrained
to catch hold of a lamp-post with his disengaged
hand, to prevent himself from falling; "what I mean is
this&mdash;you've got a nibble&mdash;yes, you've got a bite!&mdash;haul
me up quick, thou loveliest of sitters in the Jarsey market&mdash;haul
me up quick, and stow me away in your basket.
I'm hook'd and I am cotch'd&mdash;I'm your "catty' forvermore.
String me on a willow switch, and lug me right
away home!"</p>

<p>And Jack Spratte came near fainting upon the spot.
His heart was laid open&mdash;a feat of amatory surgery which
almost proved fatal to the daring lover.</p>

<p>Miss Felicia Phinney stepped back and gazed at him
in undisguised amazement.</p>

<p>"You, Jack!" said she, "you'd better jine the teetotallers
to-morrow, when you've got the headache. You
must be snapt now&mdash;any man that acts so queer, must be
blue."</p>

<p>"No, no, no!&mdash;I thought it was the punch myself,
at first&mdash;but it's not&mdash;it's love&mdash;nothing but love&mdash;love,
without no water, no sugar, nor no nutmeg. They
couldn't make punch so strong&mdash;not even with racky-fortus,
stirred up with lignum-witey! Take pity on me,
do! Mayn't I hope, Phinney, mayn't I hope? If you

<!-- page 148 -->

hav'n't time to love me now, I can wait till you're ready&mdash;yes,
wait a hopin'."</p>

<p>"You're much more likely to be sent a hoppin', Mr.
Jack Spratte."</p>

<p>"I only want to be on an understandin' now&mdash;sort of
engaged, and sort of not engaged&mdash;just to know who I
belong to."</p>

<p>"Well, once for all, you won't belong to me. Jack
Spratte, no how it could be fixed," and Miss Felicia
Phinney began to look enchantingly savage.</p>

<p>"Ah, now, don't&mdash;the cork's under&mdash;pull me up&mdash;ah,
do!"</p>

<p>Jack Spratte sank upon his knees, with mouth open
and upturned, as if he expected to be taken in hand immediately,
and to have the hook gently and scientifically
extracted, after the fashion of the experienced angler;
but he was doomed to disappointment; and, to continue
the metaphor, he may be regarded as a trout that broke
the snood, and was left among the bulrushes, to pine away,
with the barb deep in its gullet&mdash;an image, to express
this peculiar state of things, which is quite as poetical,
true and striking: as if allusion were had to the "stricken
deer," or to the "arrow-wounded dove." Birds and
quadrupeds have had a monopoly in this matter quite too
long, and original sentiment must now prepare to dive
among the fishes, for the sake of novel illustration.</p>

<p>"Jack Spratte," said the "scornful ladye," "quit
lookin' like a sturgeon with the mumps&mdash;I've done with
you&mdash;get up and tortle home the straightest way there is,
and think yourself confounded lucky that you didn't get
spanked this very night. Marry you, indeed!&mdash;why, I
wouldn't marry a decent man, or a good-lookin' man, or a
man with some sort of sense in his head; and nobody
would ever tell so big a whacker as to say you are sich a
one. Now, do you hooey home, and don't try to follow

<!-- page 149 -->

me, if you happen to know when a fool is well off;" and
the "scornful ladye" walked disdainfully away, with an
air like Juno in her tantrums.</p>

<p>Jack Spratte remained upon his knees, as if converted
into a perfect petrifaction. His eyelids never twinkled&mdash;he
seemed not even to breathe&mdash;to all intents and purposes,
he was, for the time being, a defunct Spratte, and
it is presumed that, to this day, he would still have been
found upon the same spot, like a spratte done in salt, if
the watchman had not threatened to arrest him for being
<i>non com</i>.

<p>"Where is she?" exclaimed he wildly, as he started
to his feet.</p>

<p>"Where is what?" said the nocturnal perambulator.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Spratte!" cried Jack, with a bewildered air,
"Mrs. Jack Spratte, that is to be. I'm goin' to be married,
ain't I?"</p>

<p>"I don't know whether you're going to be married
or not," was the petulant reply; "but, if you don't go
away, you'll be like to spend the rest of the evening with
the capun, at the watch'us. It's not my business to tell
people when they're goin' to be married, whether they're
sprattes or gudgeons."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it&mdash;I am&mdash;I am a gudgeon!" said Spratte,
smiting his forehead and then darting away.</p>

<p>"A werry flat sort of a fish, that chap is," said Charley,
with a sage expression.</p>

<p>Jack Spratte went directly home, just as he had been
bid&mdash;he went home, not with any definite purpose in
view&mdash;he did not want to sleep, he did not want to eat,
he did not want to sit down&mdash;he merely experienced an
undefined "want to go home," peculiar to the Anglo-Saxon
race, when they do not exactly know what to do
with themselves, (all other people go out, under similar
circumstances,) and, therefore, home he went, very much

<!-- page 150 -->

after the fashion of a livery-stable horse, when the gig
has been demolished, or the rider left in some friendly
ditch. He came home like a whirlwind; but yet his feelings
were those which may be supposed to belong to the
minor vegetables&mdash;the most diminutive of the potato tribe.
He had not been "strung upon a willow switch"&mdash;he,
Jack Spratte, was enrolled among the "great rejected"&mdash;a
goodly company enough; but he derived no consolation
from the thought.</p>

<p>Jack Spratte vowed vengeance!&mdash;Jack Spratte kept
his word!!</p>

<p>Many other lovers shared the fate which had befallen
the unhappy Spratte; and, to the general eye, it certainly
did appear as if Felicia Phinney was to realize her boast,
that "if other gals had to take up with husbands, she, at
least, could do without a master," though it was perhaps
clear enough that, in any event, the master was likely to
be but a "negative quantity."</p>

<p>Miss Felicia Phinney waxed onward in years, and, as
her years increased, her energy and her commanding
spirit seemed to gather new strength. She became omnipotent
in the market-house, and wo to those who dared
to undersell, or tried too perseveringly to cheapen her
commodities.</p>

<p>"Why now, aunty, is that the lowest?" was sometimes,
and not unfrequently, the question.</p>

<p>"Sattingly&mdash;what d'ye 'spect?&mdash;Fishes is fishes now,
and shad is skurse," would be the tart reply, and the
saleswoman would slap a pair of shad together, until they
resounded through the arches of the market like the report
of a swivel&mdash;"skurse enough, and the profits being
small, them as prices, ought to buy&mdash;that's the principle
I go upon," and the fishes would again be brought in
contact, to the great discomposure of all who happened
to be within hearing.</p>

<!-- page 151 -->

<p>In appeals of this sort, the maiden fish-woman seldom
failed to be successful&mdash;especially when the customer
happened to be rather unpractised in the affairs of the
market&mdash;for there was something peculiarly imposing in
her tone and attitude, as she held a fish by the gills in each
hand. Mark Antony himself was not more persuasive
over the remains of the slain C&aelig;sar, than was Miss Felicia
Phinney when haranguing over her "skurse shad."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! it's well she bought something," would be
the after remark, "for if there's any thing I hate to do,
it is being obligated and necessiated to flop a customer
over the head with a shad&mdash;'specially if it's a lady, with
a bran-new, tearin' fine bonnet&mdash;a hard flop with a shad
is sudden death and run for the coroner, on spring fashions.
But when people prices, they've got to buy. I go
for principles, and if they won't buy, why, flopped they
ought to be, and flopped they must be, or our rights will
soon be done for. People are gettin' so sassy now, that
by'm'by, if they're not learnt manners, they'll take our
shad for nothin', and make us carry 'em home to boot.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>There certainly appears to be a retributive principle in
nature, which, sooner or later, victimizes us as we have
victimized others&mdash;a species of moral <i>lex talionis</i>, which
returns the ingredients of our chalice to our own lips.
No man ever made a greater "bull" than he who manufactured
a brazen representative of the animal, that
Phalaris might roast his victims in it, and hear their bellowing
cries&mdash;for the ingenious artificer was himself the
earliest victim, and roared like a calf. The original
hangman does not live in story. It is but fair, however,
to infer that he died by the rope, and either strangled
himself, or had that friendly office performed for him by
another. All who introduced refinements in the application
of the axe&mdash;that most aristocratic of executive

<!-- page 152 -->

instruments&mdash;have themselves been subjected to a different
process of "shortening" from any set down in Miss
Leslie's "Domestic Cookery;" and probably the inventor
of solitary confinement and the "Pennsylvania system of
prison discipline," was she of the "mistleto bough"&mdash;the
identical lady of the "old oak chest." The retributive
principle goes even further than this. There are retributive
husbands and retributive wives&mdash;such, at least, do
they seem to be&mdash;whose office appears to consist in being
a penance for previous jiltings, previous flirtations, and
antecedent insults of all kinds, to the blind little gentleman
who primitively sports with bow and arrow, disdaining
recourse to the use of fire-arms. In this sense, Mr.
Brownstout was a retribution&mdash;a retribution for all the
past offences of Miss Felicia Phinney. He had been
ambushed far onward in her course through time; so
that when she thought the past forgotten, and when she
had measurably forgotten the past, the retributive husband
might, like a steel trap, be sprung upon her.
Whether Brownstout&mdash;Mr. Brownstout&mdash;had been created
and trained for this especial purpose, does not appear.
He was but a little fellow, it is true&mdash;in this respect, his
person and his name were in evident contradiction to
each other; but he was an ample sufficiency to bring
about the purposes for which he was intended.</p>

<p>There is, they say, such a thing as love at first sight&mdash;an
instantaneous attack, resembling somewhat the unexpected
assault of cholera, in Calcutta or thereabouts, where
the victim, doubled up, at once falls to the ground. This
spontaneous combustion is not perhaps so frequent in
modern days, as when the world was younger. Time and
change, atmospherical or otherwise, modify all disorders,
and by these influences, love, like the lightning, has, to
a considerable extent, fallen under the control of science,
and has ceased to be so rash, sudden, and explosive as it

<!-- page 153 -->

was; while the actual cases do not exhibit symptoms so
imminent and dangerous. Young gentlemen now-a-days
are not nearly so apt, according to the popular phrase, to
be "struck all of a heap," as their grandfathers and their
paternal predecessors are represented to have been. The
Fire-King thought little of remaining in the oven until the
dinner was baked&mdash;a feat at which precedent ages would
have looked aghast&mdash;but experiment has since proved
that the generality of our kind are salamanders to the
same extent, and a similar truth appears to have been
demonstrated, as to the capacity existing in the present
era, to withstand the fire of the brightest eyes that ever
beamed from a side-box at the opera. Who ever hears
that Orlando has shot himself for love with a percussion
pistol, or with one of your six barrelled, repeating detonators?
No&mdash;that fashion expired before the flint lock
was superseded, and when the steam engine came roaring
along, the lover ceased to sigh,&mdash;instead of suffering
himself to be pale and disheveled, he looks in the mirror
and brushes his whiskers; and, as hearts are not
knocked about so violently as they were at the period of
small swords and chapeaus, it follows as a natural consequence,
that they are very rarely broken past repair.</p>

<p>Miss Felicia Phinney, it may be, from having so long
evaded the "soft impeachment," was finally afflicted
somewhat after the fashion of our ancestors. Her constitution,
not being accustomed&mdash;perhaps we should say
seasoned&mdash;to such shocks, "took it hard." An individual
of her "timber" could not be expected to "pine;"
but when Mr. Brownstout first insinuatingly and delicately
asked the price of a shad&mdash;in those very tones which
cause lovers' words to sound "so silver sweet by night"&mdash;she
felt that her hour had come&mdash;and that her "unhoused
free condition must be put in circumscription and
confine." Whether she was affected by the force of

<!-- page 154 -->

contrast, in joining which, as Mr. Sheridan Knowles has
taken occasion to remark, "lieth love's delight," or whether
Mr. Brownstout only chanced to present himself at
the propitious moment, is a problem which the parties
themselves, unaccustomed as they are to such analysis,
could not undertake to solve. It is true that Felicia
Phinney was somewhat tall and not a little muscular, and
that Mr. Brownstout had no pretensions either to length,
or to any unusual degree of latitude in form. She was
bold, determined, and rather Stentorian in her vocalities&mdash;he
was mild, submissive and plausible, when it was
necessary&mdash;being both serpentine and dovelike.</p>

<p>Brownstout saw that he had made an impression.&mdash;Every
one intuitively knows when he has been thus fortunate;
and he justly thought that if he had been so successful
when only asking the price of a fish, results must
ensue proportionably greater, if he were actually to become
the purchaser of the article; for, if a mere tap at the door
is productive of notable consequences, a regular peal with
the knocker cannot fail to rouse the entire household.
Now Brownstout, who at that period was "a tailor by
trade," but one who had a soul so much above buttons
that he could but rarely be persuaded to sew any of them
on, had a tolerably clear perception of the fact, that it
would be rather a comfortable thing&mdash;a nice thing, indeed&mdash;to
hang up his hat in a house of his own, and to
possess a wife gifted with the faculty of making money&mdash;a
sublunary arrangement of surpassing loveliness, provided
the wife be duly impressed with a sense of its symmetrical
proportions, and has the good taste not to recur
to the subject too often. On the one hand, he saw&mdash;"in
his mind's eye, Horatio"&mdash;enchanting visions of ninepins,
shuffleboard and other exercises of that sort, made still more
agreeable by proper allowances of ale and tobacco&mdash;while,
on the other hand, a sufficient basis&mdash;"a specie basis"&mdash;for

<!-- page 155 -->

all these absorbing delights was evident in a stand at
the mart piscatorial, femininely attended. There was a
beautiful harmony in this aspect of the case, that came
straight home to his bosom. It combined dignity with
utility&mdash;poetry with practice&mdash;the sweet with the useful,
in such architectural grace, that it was not in his nature
to abandon the prospect. He had what few men have&mdash;a
scheme of life before him, which dove-tailed into all his
peculiarities of disposition, and might be pronounced
perfect. It is not then to be wondered at that Thais at
Alexander's side, on the memorable evening when the
mail brought the election returns from Persia, was not
more soul-subduing than Miss Felicia Phinney seemed in
the eyes of the enraptured Brownstout.</p>

<p>It was not in his way, to be sure. He was not altogether
accustomed to such matters; but as he was aware
of the truth of the axiom, "nothing venture, nothing
have," he ultimately made the desperate resolve to buy a
fish, and&mdash;reckless man!&mdash;to pay for it!&mdash;to buy, if
necessary to the completion of his great design, several
successive fishes and to pay for them, and he saw but one
difficulty in the way. His road was clear enough so far
as the mere purchase was involved; but it was the second
clause in the programme of the operation which somewhat
puzzled Mr. Brownstout, as indeed it often puzzles
financiers of a more elevated range. He might buy, but,
like Macbeth, he did not know how to "trammel up the
consequence," which was to pay. It is true that a certain
practical philosopher has decided that "base is the
slave who pays;" yet there are times when circumstances
so combine against the principles of "free trade" that to
pay is unavoidable. Mr. Brownstout felt his situation to
be a case in point, and he was sadly puzzled as to the
mode in which this monetary obstacle was to be surmounted,
until he remembered that, in default of assets,

<!-- page 156 -->

there is a mode of hypothecating one's hopes and prospects
so that they may be "coined to drachmas." He
resolved to borrow on his personal liability, secured by
the "collateral" of his chances in matrimony, of course
promising a premium proportionate to the risk. For the
means of obtaining a half dollar's worth of fish, he was,
at a future day, to return a full dollar, which is not unreasonable,
considering the shadowy nature of prospective
dollars, dependent on contingencies&mdash;dollars, so situated,
are very uncertain dollars&mdash;dollars, which are "to be or
not to be," as the fates may determine. When any one
says "I'll owe you a dollar," it often requires acute ears
to detect even the approaching jingle thereof.</p>

<p>"A sweet morning. Miss Phinney!&mdash;a lovely morning&mdash;quite
circumambient and mellifluous, if I may use the
expression. Such mornings as this cause us bachelors
to feel like posts in a flower garden&mdash;we may look on, to
be sure, but no rosies and posies are blooming for us&mdash;we
are nothing but interlopers and don't belong to the family&mdash;solitary
and forlorn in the middle of the crowd. More
juvenile people, such as you, Miss Phinney, don't realize
those things; but for me!"&mdash;and Brownstout assumed an
expression peculiarly plaintive, as he stood in the market-house
<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> to the shad basket.</p>

<p>"I minds my own business, Mr. Brownstout, and never
trades in rosies and posies," was the gentle reply; "the
beautifulest mornings, to my thinking, is them when people
bites sharp and are hungry for fish. Hyperflutenations
and dictionary things are not in my way;" but Miss
Phinney was evidently pleased with Brownstout's "hyperflutenations
and dictionary things," and liked them none
the worse probably because they were not very clearly
understood.</p>

<p>"You are right, madam&mdash;perfectly right. When
people have a taste for fish, they are generally fond of fish,

<!-- page 157 -->

and are likely to show their good sense by buying fish.
I'm very much attached to fish myself. How are fish
to-day?"</p>

<p>"Why, pretty well, I thank you, Mr. Brownstout;
how do you find yourself?"</p>

<p>This being the first attempt at a joke ever essayed by
Miss Felicia Phinney, she was quite pleased with the
darling, and she laughed&mdash;rather rustily, it must be confessed,
but she did laugh; and Brownstout, not being
deficient in tact, he laughed too. If you desire to win
people's hearts, always laugh at their jokes, whether good,
bad, or indifferent&mdash;more heartily, in fact, at those which
are bad and indifferent than at the good ones. It proves
your benevolence. The good joke can take care of itself
and walk alone, while the others are rickety and require
cherishing, and are also, on this account, the greater
favourites with the author of their being.</p>

<p>Brownstout laughed&mdash;"ha&mdash;ha&mdash;hugh!" and Miss
Phinney laughed&mdash;"he&mdash;he&mdash;haw!" Pretty well on
both sides. This intermingling of laughs often leads to
an intermingling of sighs, if care be taken not to laugh too
much; for a lover habitually jocose seldom prospers with
the fair, however deep the undertow of his sentimentality.
Brownstout was aware of this, and subsided betimes into
a more amiable 'haviour of the visage.</p>

<p>He finally bought his fish, and, as they dangled from
his hand, so did he dangle after Miss Phinney, and the
combined perseverance of dangling and purchasing at
last brought him to the haven of his hopes. They were
married, and Miss Felicia Phinney was duly metamorphosed
into Mrs. Brownstout.</p>

<p>But who had urged this ill-starred attachment to so dire
a catastrophe!&mdash;who but Jack Spratte&mdash;the Varney Spratte&mdash;the
Iago Spratte&mdash;the worse than Schedoni Spratte!&mdash;Spratte,
the rejected&mdash;Spratte, the despised!! He had

<!-- page 158 -->

never forgotten, though long years had elapsed, the outrage
to his tender emotions on that memorable night of
"Copenhagen and fried oysters"&mdash;of love and despair&mdash;when
the expression of his lacerated feelings had been
imputed to the effects of punch&mdash;when, in spite of assurances
that "the hook was through the gristle of his nose,"
the obdurate fair had refused to "pull him up." Had
Jack Spratte been oblivious of his wrongs? No&mdash;they
had lain within his bosom as icy as a cold potato, while
the sweet cider of his affections had passed through all
the grades of fermentation&mdash;acetous and so forth&mdash;until
they had become vinegar, sharper than the north wind&mdash;pepper
vinegar, to which "picalillies" are not a circumstance.
The merry Spratte, in a single night, had been
converted into a pike of the fiercest description. He
frequented the shuffleboard&mdash;he early discovered the
secret of Mr. Brownstout's attachment&mdash;he treated to
slings and egg nog, until he ascertained the relative position
of parties, and all necessary particulars&mdash;he confirmed
Brownstout's wavering resolution&mdash;he lent him the
money to buy shad&mdash;and he, even he, stood groomsman
at the ceremony, covering his procrastinated triumph in
deceptive smiles, and eating cake as if his heart were filled
with sympathetic emotions.</p>

<p>Why did Jack Spratte do this?&mdash;why?&mdash;because he
knew Mr. Brownstout's sordid views&mdash;his nefarious designs&mdash;his
intention to frequent the ninepin alley and the
shuffleboard, while his wife sold fish in the market&mdash;his
resolution never to work again. It was JACK SPRATTE'S
REVENGE!! Diabolical Spratte!!!</p>

<p>The results which Jack Spratte had anticipated, as
some compensation for his sufferings, were not of slow
development. "Domestic uneasiness" gathered like a
cloud around the hearth-stone of the Brownstouts; for
Brownstout, being busily engaged in the pursuit of happiness,

<!-- page 159 -->

was not only absent the greater part of the day,
but rarely made his appearance at all until one or two
o'clock in the morning; and, when he did come, his first
visitation was to his wife's professional check apron, to
obtain an additional supply of the sinews of war.</p>

<p>"Husbands are luxuries, my dear, and must be paid
for accordingly," was his only reply to words of remonstrance;
and when the aforesaid pocket was put out of
sight, he broke things by way of demonstration, until it
was again brought within reach.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brownstout, in the warmth of her affection, for a
time tried kindness as a means of reform&mdash;she winked at
her husband's idleness and made him a weekly allowance;
but his ideas on the subject of gentlemanly expenditure,
developed themselves too rapidly to be confined within
the bounds of such limits, and he had secret recourse to
the pocket, until the deficiencies thus occasioned became
too palpable to be concealed. The cash would not balance,
and, naturally enough, the patience of Mrs. Brownstout
then kicked the beam. She "flopped" her little
husband&mdash;not with a shad, as might be expected, but
with a shovel applied in its latitude, "broadside on."</p>

<p>The next morning, silence reigned through the hapless
domicile of the Brownstouts. The masculine owner of
that name had disappeared, and with him the pocket,
check apron and all. Night after night he came not, and
Mrs. Brownstout grew meagre and dejected.</p>

<p>"I'm a lone widder feller," sighed she, "or just as
bad. When you ain't got your husband, it's pretty near
the same thing as if you hadn't none. But men is men
all the world over, and you can't help it no how. When
Brownstout fust came a courtin' to me, you'd a thought
butter wouldn't a melted in his mouth, he pretended ta
be so sniptious. He swore he loved me; but now, just
because of a little difficulty about the shovel, he's shinned

<!-- page 160 -->

it like a white-head, with my pocket full of change and
all the spoons he could lay his hands on."</p>

<p>And so Mrs. Brownstout one evening sallied forth in
search of the delinquent.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>The bar was in full practice&mdash;clients and "cases"
flocked around it in abundance. Four "hands," with
their sleeves rolled up, could scarcely, with all their quickness,
mix the "fancy drinks" fast enough to supply the
demand, so numerous were the applications for refreshment.
Corks were popping&mdash;the bottles gurgled&mdash;clouds
of cigar smoke were "rolling dun," and men had to
speak at the very stretch of their voices, to be heard over
the thunder of the balls, as they went trolling along the
board and crashing among the ninepins, anon booming
back adown the trough. There, amidst the crowd, divested
of his coat and waistcoat, to give free play to muscular
action, was Brownstout!&mdash;the faithless Brownstout!&mdash;in
his glory. His cigar and his half-empty tumbler stood
upon an adjacent ledge&mdash;in the enthusiasm of the hour, he
had not only bared his arms, but likewise girt his body with
a bandana, and tucked his trowsers into his boots. There
was a streak of chalk upon his face, which gave its general
flush of excitement a still more ruddy tinge.</p>

<p>It was his throw!</p>

<p>Nicely did Brownstout poise the ponderous ball, which
rested on his right hand, while the forefinger of the left
remained for an instant upon its upper hemisphere. He
paused a moment for an inspiring sip and a preliminary
puff&mdash;and then&mdash;the living statues never displayed more
grace in attitude&mdash;every head projected, as if their owners
would penetrate into futurity, and see results before they
were accomplished. Brownstout bowed himself to the
task, scanning the interval with that eye of skill which
so surely betokens victory, and then, with a slide like

<!-- page 161 -->

that of the feathered Mercury&mdash;whizz!&mdash;bang!&mdash;slam!&mdash;boom!&mdash;bump!&mdash;smash!!&mdash;crash!!!</p>

<p>"Another set-up!" is the general cry, and Brownstout,
with a back-handed sweep across his countenance, which
scarcely concealed the half-suppressed smile of conscious
genius beaming in every feature&mdash;though he would have
looked indifferent, had that been possible&mdash;turned himself
once more to his tumbler and to his cigar, like one
who felt that "he had done the state some service and
they knew it." He had reason to be proud. Not only
had he achieved victory for his "pard'ners" and gained
the refreshment tickets&mdash;good for a drink and trimmings&mdash;consequent
thereon&mdash;but he had also secured several bets,
couched under the mysterious phrase of being for "something
all round." Indeed, it is not certain that an "oyster
supper for six" was not also dependent on the result,
which Brownstout had mentally resolved should be an
oyster supper for one, on each of six specified nights, and
not an oyster supper for six, on one night; the last being
a common arrangement, but regarded by him as at war
with true economy, and as most "wasteful and ridiculous
excess."</p>

<p>After the first burst of exultation was over, the victors
seemed suddenly to become athirst&mdash;they smacked their
lips, and made many other conventional signs expressive
of that condition, jogging the elbows of the defeated, and
asking, very significantly, "what shall it be?"&mdash;a sound
which awakened the smiles of "the bar," the members
whereof began scientifically to handle the decanters
chiefly affected by Mr. Brownstout's "brave associates&mdash;partners
of his toil"&mdash;for had he not gained the decisive
"set-up?"</p>

<p>"Set-up!"&mdash;unlucky words! Well said Napoleon to
the Abbe De Pradt, that from the sublime to the ridiculous
there is but one step. It was so with the emperor.

<!-- page 162 -->

He and Brownstout both found that often when we have
gained a "set-up," we are nearest to a "set-down."</p>

<p>"Out of the way!" shrieked a well-known voice, the
owner of which was endeavouring to force a passage
through the crowd&mdash;"I'm sure he's here&mdash;he's always
here, and I'm come to fetch him!"</p>

<p>"The old woman!" exclaimed Brownstout, in trembling
dismay, as the tumbler slipped from his nerveless
hand, and the cigar rolled into the folds of his bosom.</p>

<p>"An old woman!" repeated the gentlemen of the bar,
letting fall their "muddlers."</p>

<p>"His old woman!" re-echoed the ninepin players,
aghast.</p>

<p>"Brownstout's old woman!" was the general chorus.</p>

<p>"Run, Brown!"</p>

<p>"Hop, Stout!!"</p>

<p>"Make yourself scarce!"</p>

<p>Too late, alas! were these kindly hints from those who
would have saved their beloved friend from the infliction
of domestic discipline. Brownstout saw that retreat was
impossible. His wife's broad hand was upon him. He
fell back breathless with terror&mdash;it is presumed that reminiscences
of the shovel danced athwart his brain.</p>

<p>Like another Mephistophiles, Jack Spratte appeared
upon the scene. The author of mischief is always in at
the catastrophe.</p>

<p>"You are a precious set of warmint!" said Mrs. Brownstout,
as she glared fiercely around&mdash;"who am I to thank
for deludin' my old man to sich places as this, to waste
his time and my money on fools and foolery?"</p>

<p>"Thank me!" exclaimed Jack Spratte, hysterically,
"me!&mdash;me! to whom you guv' the mitten!&mdash;me, who
got the bag to hold!&mdash;me, whose nose was put out of
jint!&mdash;me, whose young hopes was drownded in cold
water almost before their eyes was opened!"</p>

<!-- page 163 -->

<p>The "<i>adsum qui feci</i>" of the Latin poet was never
more finely "done into English," though it may well be
questioned whether the atrocious Spratte had ever heard
of Nisus and Euryalus.</p>

<p>The excitement became intense&mdash;the crowd huddled
around&mdash;the boys rushed from the pins to listen to the
denouement&mdash;and one thirsty soul at the bar showed his
interest in the matter, by hastily swallowing the contents
of three other gentlemen's glasses, to fortify himself for
the occasion, after which he also hurried to the centre.</p>

<p>"It was me that done it all!" continued Spratte, gesticulating
spasmodically&mdash;"I know'd he'd break your
heart!&mdash;I know'd he'd hook your money!&mdash;I know'd he'd
keep always goin' out and never comin' home agin! If
it hadn't been for me, he'd not have married you&mdash;but
now I'm revenged&mdash;now I'm happy&mdash;now I'm&mdash;ha! ha!
hugh!" and Jack Spratte sprung high into the air, and,
on his return to earth, spun round three times, and, exhausted
by emotion, fell prostrate, upsetting a table upon
which stood three "brandies" and one whisky punch.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brownstout dropped her hands, and suffered the
almost inanimate form of her husband to go lumbering to
the earth, while she stood petrified with despair at this
terrible revelation. Her heart was congealed, and every
bystander was stricken with horror at Spratte's having
been been such a "debaushed fish"&mdash;all were moved
inwardly, except the utilitarian who had imbibed the
other gentlemen's liquor, and he seized on the chance to
move outwardly, that he might sneak away without discharging
the dues for that which he had ordered himself.</p>

<p>There were no more ninepins that night&mdash;the moral influence
was such that the boys put out the lights without
being told to do so&mdash;if they had not, indeed, it is probable
the lights would have gone out of themselves. Mr.
and Mrs. Brownstout went home in a cab&mdash;they were too

<!-- page 164 -->

much overcome to walk. Jack Spratte recovered by slow
degrees&mdash;the three brandies and the whisky punch, in
which he was immersed, probably saved his life&mdash;but
Jack Spratte never smiled again, no matter how good the
joke. His bosom was seared&mdash;his heart was like a dried
cherry several seasons old, and so he became a drummer
in the marines, delighting only in the beating of tattoo
and reveille, as two of the most misanthropic of employments&mdash;the
one sending men to bed, while the other
forces them to get up. He was severe upon these points
of war, and it was noticed that he was always a little before
the time in the performance of each. Such are the
spiteful effects of blighted affections, which give acerbity
even to a musician! But Jack Spratte's revenge had
failed&mdash;most signally failed. After the events of the
ninepin alley, Brownstout was an altered man. He
might justly be spoken of as a great moral re-action.
Stung to the quick at having been made an instrument
of revenge&mdash;a mere drumstick of malignity&mdash;he burnt all
the tickets in his possession, "good," as they were, "for
refreshments at the bar"&mdash;he returned the check apron
pocket to his wife, though probably it would have been
more acceptable if any thing had remained in it. The
spoons, however, were past redemption; but what are
spoons in comparison with matrimonial comfort&mdash;what
are spoons, when one's husband works in the daytime
and never goes out in the evenings? Mrs. Brownstout was
a happy woman, and never, in fact, hinted at "spoons," unless
she had cause to suspect that her husband's thoughts
might perhaps be straying towards ninepins. That word
always brought him straight, and she but rarely had occasion
to say "spoons," except on the Fourth of July or about
the Christmas holidays. As for the bibulous individual
before alluded to, the poetic catastrophe to which he was
an accidental witness, made him so dry that he has been

<!-- page 165 -->

busy ever since in a vain endeavour to quench his thirst.
He thinks of hiring himself out as a dam to any moderate
sized river, and would do so, if the navigation company
were liberal enough to put a drop of something
in the water, just to take the chill off and to correct its
crudities.</p>

<p>And such is the end of "JACK SPRATTE'S REVENGE."

<p>CORNER LOUNGERS.</p>

<p>THERE are men&mdash;many men&mdash;whose mental callipers
grasp only a single idea&mdash;the sun of whose thought revolves
about, warms and enlightens but one little world,
that world being the contracted universe (for universe it
is to them) of their own personal affairs and individual
interests. From some congenital defect in their intellectual
optics&mdash;as spectacles for the mind remain to be
invented, and as the concave lens has not yet been adjusted
to rectify the imperfect vision of the soul&mdash;they
live within a narrow horizon, and browse, as it were,
with a tether, having a certain circumference of grass,
without the ability to take a mouthful beyond its limits.
Nor, indeed, have they any desire for such epicurean adventure.
They do not so much as wish to glance into any
field which is not peculiarly their own. The clover which
belongs to them, satisfies all their wants, and to disturb
themselves at all, as to how other people make hay, is a
stretch of ambition to which they never aspire. Armies
may devour each other&mdash;navies may go down and submit
their Paixhans artillery to the investigation of the grampus
and other martial fishes,&mdash;empires may rock and reel, like
Fourth of July revellers, in the days when the evidence
of patriotism was to make the head heavier than the heels;
but the species to which we refer, still open their shops
with unshaken nerves, take their breakfast with undiminished
appetite, and go about their business with no thought
but that of making both ends meet. To bear a hand in
the grand work of ameliorating the condition of the human
race, is a matter, in their opinion, which qualifies one for
the first vacancy in the lunatic asylum. They belong to
no philanthropic associations to regulate the price of soap

<!-- page 167 -->

in another hemisphere; nor have they ever entered into an
organization to compel the employing shoemakers of the
moon to give their apprentices half-holiday once a week
They are sure that "Convention" must be something
relative to Bedlam, and that those who wish to reform
everybody else, must stand greatly in need of some such
operation themselves. An election, to them, is an annual
nuisance&mdash;a periodical eruption, made necessary by
a defective constitution, and all the meetings which go
before, are, in their eyes, merely the premonitory symptom
that disease is reaching a crisis. Processions and
parades move their pity, and when they think at all about
the turmoil of the outer world, it is only to wonder when
the fools will have it "fixed" to their liking.</p>

<p>Far different from these is that disinterested body of
men and boys who lounge at the corners of the way in a
great metropolis; members of the human family who may
be said to be always on hand and continually in circulation.
They literally are the pillars of the state. They
prop up lamp-posts&mdash;patronise fire-plugs, and encourage
the lindens of the street in their unpractised efforts to
grow. The luxuriant trees, which adorn the front of Independence
Hall, outstrip all others in umbrageous beauty
because they, beyond all others, have been sustained by
the kindness of loungers; and they now strive to return
the compliment, by affording a canopy to intercept the rays
of the sun, and to avert the falling shower, from the
beloved friends who stand by them, have stood by them,
and will continue to stand by them, in every sort of
weather.</p>

<p>In ancient Rome, whenever that respectable republic
got itself into a difficulty with those unreasonable people
who were foolish enough to wish to regulate their own
affairs, and when the storm grew loud and threatening, it
was sometimes found necessary to intrust all things to the

<!-- page 168 -->

discretion of a dictator, whose duty it was "to take
care that the republic received no detriment." But,
without the provisions of law&mdash;without the troubles and
dangers which flowed from the Roman practice, we are
happy in the possession of a host of such officers, unrecognised,
it is true, but not the less efficient, whose
chief employment and whose main delight it is, reckless
of honour and emolument, to take care that nothing
detrimental happens to the republic. Their regards are
always upon it, in jealous supervision. They are no
speculative overseers, who imperfectly attend to exterior
affairs, by lounging in slippered ease in luxurious offices,
disporting themselves over the newspapers of the day.
They are not influenced by the mere report of scouts, or
the sinister assertions of the interested; but make it their
daily practice to hear with their own ears and to see with
their own eyes. Nay, they push their zealous watchfulness
so far, that they may often be seen in the exercise
of their high functions, when other mortals, less gifted
with discrimination, can discover nothing to excite their
notice. When the pavier is at work in the highway,
heaving the weighty rammer with most emphatic groan,
not a pebble is driven to its place, that the genuine
lounger has not marked in every stage of its progress. No
gas-pipe is adjusted, without undergoing a similar scrutiny,
and the sanctified spot where the pig was killed or the
hound was run over, acquires such mysterious and fascinating
importance in the lounger's estimation, that he
will stand whole days in sombre contemplation of so distinguished
a locality. Even the base of Pompey's statue,
where great C&aelig;sar fell, could not prove more attractive;
and Rizzio's blood, which stains the floor of Holyrood,
is not more dear to the antiquary than are the marks left
by an overturned wagon, to the non-commissioned superintendents
of the city. Indeed, they have been seen

<!-- page 169 -->

congregated for hours around the house from which the
tenants moved on the previous night, without complying
with the vexatious ceremony of paying the rent&mdash;a feudal
exaction perpetuated by landlords for the perplexity of
the people. Should a masterless hat be found, or a drop
of blood be discovered in the street, it forms a nucleus
for a gathering. No matter how slight the cause may
seem to the ordinary intellect, there are persons who look
more deeply into things, and derive wisdom from circumstances
apparently too trivial to deserve regard.</p>

<p>But they are secret, too. The perfect lounger, though
prodigal of his presence, is a niggard with his words. It
is his vocation to see, and not to speak. His inferences
are locked within the recesses of his own breast. He is
wary and diplomatic, and not like other individuals, to
be sounded "from the lowest note to the top of his compass,"
by the curiosity of each passing stranger. He
opposes no one in the acquisition of knowledge&mdash;he places
no stumbling-blocks in the way; but, by his taciturnity,
intimates that the results of his labours are not to be
obtained for nothing. It is his motto that if you desire
information, you must use the proper means to acquire it;
for you have the same natural qualifications for the purpose
as he.</p>

<p>That this characteristic belongs to the street lounger&mdash;we
have nothing to say about the inferior class who operate
solely within walls&mdash;is evident from the fact that it
rarely happens in the course of the most inquisitive life,
that any one, on approaching a crowd, can ascertain, by
inquiry of its component members, why it has assembled.
The question is either unheeded altogether, or else a
supercilious glance is turned upon the querist, with a
laconic response that the party does not know. Ostensibly,
nobody knows a jot about the matter, except the
fortunate few who form the inner circle, and, as it were,

<!-- page 170 -->

hem in all knowledge. They who extricate themselves
early from the interior pressure, and walk away, either
with smiling faces, as if the joke were good, or with a
solemn sadness of the brow, as if their sensibilities
had been lacerated, even they "don't know!" None
will tell, except perchance it be a luckless urchin not yet
taught to economize his facts, or some unsophisticated
girl with a market basket, who talks for talking's sake.
But who believes that the initiated "don't know"&mdash;that
the omnipresent lounger "don't know?" It is not to be
believed. He does know; but from some as yet undetermined
and unappreciated singularity of his nature, it is
rather his pleasure to be looked upon as ignorant, than to
"unlace his reputation" by proving false to so cardinal
a point in the practice of his kind, as to be a mere bulletin
for others' uses. What he knows, he knows&mdash;let that
content you. He has employment for all he has acquired,
which, to outward appearance, would be spoiled by participation;
but where, or how, or when he proposes to
use it, is a problem which remains to be solved.</p>

<p>Unawed by the state of the weather, these watchful
sentinels are always abroad; and so far are they elevated
above the influences of prevailing effeminacy, that they
indulge so little in home delights as to induce many to
believe that they dispense altogether with the enervating
comforts of a fixed domicile. When their nature must
needs "recuperate," it is supposed they "rotate" for
repose, and that thus, by never couching themselves consecutively
in the same nest, they catch abuses napping,
by their sudden and unexpected appearance "so early in
the morning."</p>

<p>But, whatever may be the private habits, entomologically
or ornithologically speaking, of "the corner
lounger," he is a self-evident proposition and an undeniable
fact. There may be doubts as to the existence of

<!-- page 171 -->

other things&mdash;all circumstantial nature may be disputed:
but he must be confessed. Go where you will, he is
there, and as he is there to everybody, his there must be
everywhere, paradoxical as it may seem. His visibility
is co-existent with your presence, and it would require
the pen of transcendentalism to explain the mysterious
nature of his wonderful ubiquity. We have not language
to pourtray the phenomena developed in this respect by a
civic lounger of the superlative class; but, in homely
phrase, if we may so express it, like a speck upon the
eye itself, look where you will, he stands full blown before
you. He is rarely seen in motion&mdash;never <i>in transitu;</i>
but he is at your elbow when you depart, and when you
have reached your end, the lounger is at the place in anticipation,
leisurely drumming with his heels upon a post
and bearing no traces of a forced march. By what magic
process this is accomplished, no one can tell. There is
no proof that he travels. There is no physical sign in his
appearance, to induce a belief that he excels in locomotion,
or has any taste for such active employment as would
seem to be necessary for achieving such results; and so
much are the scientific puzzled to account for the fact to
which we have reference, that a paper is said to be in
preparation for the "Philosophical Transactions," having
for its object to determine "whether a corner lounger,
in his distinctive and individual capacity, be one or
many; or whether the specimen be not multitudinous,
in an identical shape and image, so that in the same form
and as one person, he is gifted with the capacity to be
everywhere at once." Every nice observer will be inclined
to receive the last hypothesis as the correct impression;
for he must often have had abundant reason to
conclude that the lounger is really thus, "as broad and
general as the casing air"&mdash;a Monsieur Tonson who has
always "come again."</p>

<!-- page 172 -->

<p>There are, however, certain peculiarities in this matter
which are also worthy of remark&mdash;little niceties in the
case which deserve their comment. As each man is supposed
to have his superintending star&mdash;his supervising
genius, which, both in weal and wo, hovers about his
footsteps or directs his course, so each individual has his
lounging "John Jones"&mdash;his familiar from the spirit-land
of loaferdom. We know him not, but in his palpable
form&mdash;we have exchanged no word or kindness with
him&mdash;he has no interest in our affairs, nor we in his&mdash;there
is no earthly tie existing; but when we have once
marked our coincident lounger, he is there for ever&mdash;our
inevitable fate&mdash;the everlasting frontispiece in the volume
of our experiences&mdash;our perpetual double, in sunshine or
in rain. Let the fact once be presented to your sensorium
that you rarely go to any place without seeing "that
man," and your doom is sealed. You never will go
anywhere without seeing him, either there or on your way
there, from that time forth; and when you do not see him,
be assured that there is abundant reason to doubt whether
you are really yourself, and whether, notwithstanding
appearances, you are not mistaken in the person&mdash;so that
in shaving your apparent countenance, you may have
shaved an impostor, and in drinking your wine, you may
have been pouring refreshment down the throat of a rogue.
When a man is without his shadow, what assurance is
there that himself is he? But when one's reflex is present,
he may, in some cases, be satisfied that money put
in his own pocket, is not intrusted to the care of a peculator.
And in this way is it that wisdom derives comfort
from the phenomenon that we have attempted to
explain.</p>

<p>Is the citizen martially inclined, and does he attend
volunteer parades, to gratify the heroic longings of his
soul by having his toes macerated by iron heels, his ribs

<!-- page 173 -->

compressed by ruffian elbows, or his abdominal capacity
astonished by the musket-but of the authoritative sentinel,
who knocks the breath out of your body, while politely
exclaiming "stand back, gentlemen; a little further, if
you please!" There is his attendant lounger, in the best
of possible places, and safely beyond the reach of the mob-repressing
guard.</p>

<p>Is the foiled pickpocket borne triumphantly to office
of Recorder, Alderman or Mayor? Look ye now and see.
Within the rail of official function, close to magisterial
dignity, there stands your ghost, your "bodach glas;" not
antecedent or consequent, but instant. No need to wish,
or call, or wonder at his absence. You are here, and he
is&mdash;there&mdash;cause and effect, linked together by hooks of
steel. 'Tis your <i>alter ego</i>&mdash;your t'other eye.</p>

<p>Do you attend the burial of a friend, and walk in gloom
and silent sorrow? Dash aside your tears, and behold,
leaning against that funeral tree which overshadows the
sad procession, an evidence is apparent that even in grief
your unknown coadjutor is true to his vocation. You
will never be deserted&mdash;never!</p>

<p>Are you essentially humane, taking delight to see murder
choked and homicide made breathless, that the world
may become tender-hearted and averse to horrors by familiarity
with Ketch's delectable countenance? "That
man" is helping to support the rectangular superstructure
which reforms men by the speedy dislocation of their
vertebral column, and improves the age by the disjointing
of necks. He and Ketch seem to be sworn brothers.</p>

<p>But fear not. Though this circumstance of yours be
something that cannot be avoided, either by secresy respecting
your movements&mdash;for he is an intuition&mdash;by
rapidity of travel&mdash;for he is ubiquitous&mdash;or by cunning
evasion&mdash;for he is instinctive&mdash;yet no harm appears ever
to have arisen from this species of Chang and Engship&mdash;from

<!-- page 174 -->

this disjunctive Siamese twinnery, if we may so
venture upon a terminological experiment, and coin a
phrase to distinguish an unnamed idea. The "inevitable"
may be sad in his expression; but he shows no sign of
being mischievous in his soul, nor is his observation sarcastic
in its conclusions. He is a student of humanity,
ever at his book, but rather touched with melancholy at
the lesson thus derived, than made misanthropic by a
knowledge of our weaknesses and follies. Exulting beauty
passes by him, and at the "rustling of silks and the creaking
of shoes," which have betrayed so many hearts, he
sighs to think that a bad cold or a misdirected bucket
would soon reduce that joyousness to the most pitiable
plight. He looks plaintively at the unheeding dog, who,
ignorant of laws, and with muzzle at home, sports onward
to the fell clutches of the sordid Sambo, to whom canine
slaughter is a trade and profit; and he draws analogies
between puppyhood and youthful prime, revelling in wild
delights, and unwarned of "ketchers" till they are caught.
The lounger is a lonely moralist, who has too much general
sympathy to isolate affection by contracting his sphere
of usefulness&mdash;too disinterested to narrow himself down
to a pursuit of selfish aggrandizement&mdash;too full of heart to
be cooped within the ribs of a trade, and too anxious
about the general welfare ever to give rest to his anxious
eye. He is the general guardian&mdash;the foster mother of us
all; and perhaps it is our ignorance alone that regards him
as being exclusive in his attentions; just as childhood
thinks that a portrait watches all its movements, or as the
moon seems marching above our heads wherever we go.</p>

<p>Such as we have described is Nicholas Nollikins&mdash;he
with the breastpin&mdash;he who watches so intently the
shaving, evolved and elaborated from its parent stick by
the keen edge of his whittle. Though Nollikins appears
to be cutting, and it is reasonable to suppose that he is

<!-- page 175 -->

cutting, yet Nollikins is also thinking. In fact, he is a
sage&mdash;not such as they stuff ducks withal, or liquidate
into medicinal tea&mdash;but that sort of sage which has sagacity
for its result, better far than ducks or teas. Nollikins,
however, labours under a difficulty. He is reflective
and observant, but not practical. He never comes
to the application, for that word is particularly what he
dislikes; and hence the deep river of his probable usefulness
has its perfect navigation interrupted by a dam in
the channel. His ships never come to port. Nollikins
has in his time tried many trades; but none of them agreed
with him, except the office of being midshipman to an
oyster boat, and there were points even in this profession
which were repugnant to his finer emotions. "Raking"
on dry land is not perhaps so disagreeable; but let those
who think that words are identical and synonymous, and
represent the same thing at sea and ashore, try raking for
oysters, as Nicholas Nollikins did for a whole season, and
they will ever after have a correct appreciation of differences.
When the boat returned to the wharf, Nicholas
was at home. His taste for society could now be gratified.
The delicate aspirations of his nature found food in the
distribution of oysters, and his imagination had room to
expand as he opened the bivalves. What a delightful
compound of business and pleasure is that phase of the
oyster trade which sells wholesale, but yet does not scorn
the niceties of retail to the hungry wanderer! Benevolence
and information are here combined&mdash;to talk and to
eat&mdash;to question and to impart nourishment&mdash;to benefit
both the physique and the morale at the same time&mdash;who
would not be midshipman of an oyster boat&mdash;who could
not live whole days at the wharf, under such circumstances?
Nollikins could&mdash;Nollikins did&mdash;thrice happy
Nollikins!</p>

<p>But the genial sky always has clouds in it&mdash;a spring

<!-- page 176 -->

morning, be it as balmy as it may, is generally followed
by a cloudy afternoon. When oysters are sold and eaten,
it is a necessity, arising from the unfortunate state of
things in this sublunary sphere, that you must go after
additional oysters&mdash;that is, if you want more; for oysters,
unlike the accommodating shad, have not yet learned to
come up the river of themselves, that they may be caught
at the very door. Few things, in the eating way, have
that innate politeness so remarkable in the character of a
shad. Had the shad been blessed with feet and hands,
there cannot be a doubt but that it would complete its
measure of complaisance by walking up the street and
ringing at the bell, with a civil inquiry for the cook and
the gridiron. It would come about half an hour before
breakfast, and never defer its call till after tea. Commend
us to the shad, as the best mannered fish that swims.
Many men might go to school to the shad; and indeed, if
our piscatory learning be not at fault, the shad do assemble
in schools, to which cause possibly may be attributed
the excellence of their training. Always bow with
deference to a shad&mdash;it has travelled far to enjoy the
pleasure of your acquaintance. The oyster, however, is
churlish&mdash;it makes no free visitation, and upon this fact
hinges the fate of Nicholas Nollikins. He could not
abide the painful contrast which was brought home to his
sensibilities, by the change from the wharf to the cove&mdash;from
society to solitude&mdash;from the delicate play of the
iron-handled knife, (so favourable to the exhibition of
grace and skill,) to the heavy drag of rakes and tongs in
the oyster bed; and he, therefore, concluded to resign his
regular commission, and to obtain his living for the future
by dabbling only in the fancy branches of human employment.
When the boats come up, he has no objection to
taking a place, for the time being, as salesman to the
concern; and in this way, working only when urgent

<!-- page 177 -->

necessity compels, and consuming the rest of his existence
in the ornamentals of life, such as leaning against a post
and speculating on the chances and changes of terrestrial
affairs, our worthy Nicholas contrives to bite the sunny
side from the peach, leaving the green core for those who
are mean enough to be content with it.</p>

<p>Nicholas has a home, upon a desperate emergency;
but he does not trouble it often with his presence, for
reasons which he regards as perfectly adequate to excuse
any delinquency in this respect, which calumnious tongues
may think proper to lay to his charge.</p>

<p>"As for goin' home, Billy Bunkers," said he, one day,
in confidence to the long lad with the short roundabout,
who leans upon the opposite side of the lamp post; "as
for goin' home, Billy, savin' and exceptin' when you
can't help it, why it's perfectly redicklis. If people's
opinyins could be made to agree, that would be one thing,
and you might go home. But as these opinyins don't
agree, why that's another thing, and it's best to clear out
and keep out, jist as long as you kin. What's your sitivation
when you do go home? There's the old man, and
there's the old voman and the rest of them, hurtin' your
feelins as bad as if they was killin' kittens with a brickbat.
As soon as you're inside of the door, they sing out
like good fellers, 'Eh, waggybone!&mdash;Ho! ho! lazyboots!&mdash;hellow,
loafer!&mdash;ain't you most dead a workin' so hard?&mdash;t'aint
good for your wholesome to be so all-fired industrious!'
That's the way they keep a goin' on, aggravatin' you for
everlastin'. They don't understand my complaint&mdash;they
can't understand a man that's lookin' up to better things.
I tell you, Billy," exclaimed Nicholas, with tears in his
eyes, "when a feller's any sort of a feller, like you and
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Billy, complacently; "we're the fellers&mdash;it
takes us."</p>

<!-- page 178 -->

<p>"When a feller's any sort of a feller, to be ketched at
home is little better than bein' a mouse in a wire-trap.
They poke sticks in your eye, squirt cold water on your
nose, and show you to the cat. Common people, Billy&mdash;low,
ornery, common people, can't make it out when
natur's raised a gentleman in the family&mdash;a gentleman all
complete, only the money's been forgot. If a man won't
work all the time&mdash;day in and day out&mdash;if he smokes by
the fire or whistles out of the winder, the very gals bump
agin him and say 'get out of the way, loaf!' Now what
I say is this&mdash;if people hasn't had genteel fotchin' up,
you can no more expect 'em to behave as if they had
been fotch up genteel, than you can make good cigars
out of a broom handle."</p>

<p>"That are a fact," ejaculated Billy Bunkers, with emphasis;
for Billy has experienced, in his time, treatment at
home somewhat similar to that complained of by Nicholas
Nollikins.</p>

<p>"But, Billy, my son, never mind, and keep not a lettin'
on," continued Nollikins, and a beam of hope irradiated
his otherwise saturnine countenance; "the world's
a railroad and the cars is comin'&mdash;all we'll have to do is
to jump in, chalked free. There will be a time&mdash;something
must happen. Rich widders are about yet, though
they are snapped up so fast. Rich widders, Billy, are
'special providences,' as my old boss used to say when
I broke my nose in the entry, sent here like rafts to pick
up deservin' chaps when they can't swim no longer.
When you've bin down twy'st, Billy, and are jist off
agin, then comes the widder a floatin' along. Why,
splatterdocks is nothin' to it, and a widder is the best of
all life-preservers, when a man is most a case, like you
and me."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not perticklar, not I, nor never was. I'll
take a widder, for my part, if she's got the mint drops,

<!-- page 179 -->

and never ask no questions. I'm not proud&mdash;never was
harrystocratic&mdash;I drinks with anybody, and smokes all
the cigars they give me. What's the use of bein' stuck
up, stiffy? It's my principle that other folks are nearly
as good as me, if they're not constables nor aldermen. I
can't stand them sort."</p>

<p>"No, Billy," said Nollikins, with an encouraging
smile, "no, Billy, such indiwidooals as them don't know
human natur'&mdash;but, as I was goin' to say, if there happens
to be a short crop of widders, why can't somebody
leave us a fortin?&mdash;That will do as well, if not better.
Now look here&mdash;what's easier than this? I'm standin'
on the wharf&mdash;the rich man tries to go aboard of the
steamboat&mdash;the niggers push him off the plank&mdash;in I
jumps, ca-splash! The old gentleman isn't drownded;
but he might have been drownded but for me, and if he
had a bin, where's the use of his money then? So he gives
me as much as I want now, and a great deal more when
he defuncts riggler, accordin' to law and the practice of
civilized nations. You see&mdash;that's the way the thing
works. I'm at the wharf every day&mdash;can't afford to lose
a chance, and I begin to wish the old chap would hurra
about comin' along. What can keep him?"</p>

<p>"If it 'ud come to the same thing in the end," remarked
Billy Bunkers, "I'd rather the niggers would
push the old man's little boy into the water, if it's all the
same to him. Them fat old fellers are so heavy when
they're skeered, and hang on so&mdash;why, I might get
drownded before I had time to go to bank with the
check! But what's the use of waitin'? Couldn't we
shove 'em in some warm afternoon, ourselves? Who'd
know in the crowd?"</p>

<p>"I've thought of that. Bunkers, when a man was before
me that looked like the right sort. I've often said
to myself, 'My friend, how would you like to be washed

<!-- page 180 -->

for nothin'?'&mdash;but, Billy, there might be mistakes&mdash;perhaps,
when you got him out, he couldn't pay. What
then?"</p>

<p>"Why, keep a puttin' new ones in to soak every day,
till you do fish up the right one."</p>

<p>"It won't do, my friend&mdash;they'd smoke the joke&mdash;all
the riff-raff in town would be pushin' old gentlemen
into the river, and the elderly folks would have to give
up travellin' by the steamboat. We must wait, I'm
afeared, till the real thing happens. The right person will
be sure to come along."</p>

<p>"I hope so; and so it happens quick, I don't much
care whether it's the old man, or his hide boy, or that
rich widder, that gets a ducking. I'm not proud."</p>

<p>"And when it does happen," exclaimed Nollikins,
swelling with a triumphant anticipation, "who but me,
with more beard than a nannygoat, and a mile of gold
chain, goin' up Chestnut street! Who but Nollikins,
with his big dog!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and Billy Bunkers, with two big dogs, a chasin'
the pigs into the chaney shops."</p>

<p>"Then you'll see me come the nonsense over the old
folks&mdash;who's loafer now!&mdash;and my dog will bite their
cat&mdash;who's ginger-pop and jam spruce beer, at this present
writin', I'd like to know!"</p>

<p>And, in a transport of enthusiasm, Nollikins knocked
the hat of Billy Bunkers, a shallow, dishlike castor, clear
across the street.</p>

<p>Thus, wrapped in present dreams and future anticipations&mdash;a
king that is to be&mdash;lives Nicholas Nollikins&mdash;the
grand exemplar of the corner loungers. There he
stations himself; for hope requires a boundless prospect
and a clear look out, that, by whatever route fortune
chooses to approach, she may have a prompt reception.
Nicholas and his tribe exist but for to-morrow, and rely

<!-- page 181 -->

firmly upon that poetic justice, which should reward those
who wait patiently until the wheel of fortune turns up a
prize. They feel, by the generous expansion of their
souls, by their impatience of ignoble toil, by their aspirations
after the beautiful and nice, that their present position
in society is the result of accident and inadvertency,
and that, if they are not false to the nature that is within
them, the time must come when the mistake will be rectified,
and "they shall walk in silk attire and siller hae
to spare," which is not by any means the case at present.
All that can be expected just now, is, that they should
spare other people's "siller."</p>
