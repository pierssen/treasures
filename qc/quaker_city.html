on the Bench of Justice, the Knife and the Torch in place of Law, a People beggared by dishonest
Banks, and a city disgraced by Riot, by Robbery, by Murder! Are these the fruits, for which

<h3>The origin and object of this Book.</h3>

</div>

<p>ONE winter night I was called to the bedside of a dying friend. I found him
sitting up in his death-couch, pale and trembling yet unawed by the gathering
shadows of the tomb. His white hairs fell over his clammy brow, his dark grey
eye, glared with the unnatural light, which, heralds the approach of death. Old
K&mdash;&mdash; had been a singular man. He had been a profound lawyer, without fame
or judgeship. In quiet he pursued his dreamy way, deriving sufficient from his profession,
to support him in decency and honor. In a city, where no man has a
friend, that has not money to back him, the good old lawyer had been my friend.
He was one of those old-fashioned lawyers who delight to bury themselves among
their books, who love the law for its theory, and not for its trick and craft and despicable
chicanery. Old K&mdash;&mdash; had been my friend, and now I sat by his bedside
in his last hour.</p>

<p>"Death is coming," he said with a calm smile, "but I dread him not. My accounts
with God are settled; my face is clammy with the death-sweat, but I have
no fear. When I am gone, you will find in yonder desk, a large pacquet, inscribed
with your name. This pacquet, contains the records of my experience
as a private councillor and a lawyer, for the last thirty years. You are young and
friendless, but you have a pen, which will prove your best friend. I bequeath
these Papers to you; they may be made serviceable to yourself and to the
world&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>In a faint voice, I asked the good old lawyer, concerning the nature of these
records.</p>

<p>"They contain a full and terrible development of the Secret Life of Philadelphia.
In that pacquet, you will find, records of crimes, that never came to trial,
murders that have never been divulged; there you will discover the results of
secret examinations, held by official personages, in relation to atrocities almost
too horrible for belief&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then," said I, "Philadelphia is not so pure as it looks!"</p>

<p>"Alas, alas, that I should have to say it," said the old man with an expression
of deep sorrow, "But whenever I behold its regular streets and formal look, I
think of The Whited Sepulchre, without all purity, within, all rottenness and dead
men's bones. Have you courage, to write a book from those papers?"</p>

<p>"Courage?"</p>

<p>"Aye, courage, for the day has come, when a man dare not speak a plain
truth, without all the pitiful things of this world, rising up against him, with adder's
tongues and treacherous hands. Write a book, with all your heart bent on
some good object, and for every word you write, you will find a low-bred calumniator,

<!-- page 4 -->

eager to befoul you with his slanders. Have you courage, to write a book
from the materials, which I leave you, which shall be devoted to these objects:
To defend the sanctity of female honor; to show how miserable and corrupt is
that Pseudo-Christianity which tramples on every principle ever preached or
practiced by the Savior Jesus; to lay bare vice in high places, and strip gilded
crimes of their tinsel. Have you courage for this?"</p>

<p>I could only take the old man's hand, within my own, and murmur faintly,
"I'll try!"</p>

<p>"Have you courage, to lift the cover from the Whited Sepulchre, and while
the world is crying honor to its outward purity, to show the festering corruption
that rankles in its depths? Then those records are yours!"</p>

<p>I sat beside the deathbed of the old man all night long. His last hours were
past in calm converse, full of hope and trust in God. Near the break of day, he
died. God bless him! He was my friend, when I had nothing but an orphan's
gratitude, to tender in return for his friendship. He was a lawyer, and <i>honest</i>;
a Christian and yet no bigot; a philosopher and yet no sceptic.</p>

<p>After his funeral, I received the pacquet of papers, inscribed with my name,
and endorsed, REVELATIONS OF THE SECRET LIFE OF PHILADELPHIA, <i>being the records
of thirty years practice as a councillor, by</i> * * * K&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>The present book is founded upon those portions of the Revelations, more intimately
connected with the present day.</p>

<p>With the same sincerity with which I have written this Book of the Quaker
City, I now give it to my countrymen, as an illustration of the life, mystery and
crime of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>It was commenced on the 6th of September 1844, and published in ten numbers,
with a success, almost without parallel in the annals of our literature.
Since its first publication, near 40,000 numbers of the book have been sold.
Whether this success is owing to the merits of the work, or the malignant persecution
of a few paltry enemies, I leave the reader to determine.</p>

<p>I now present the work to the public in complete form, after nine editions in
numbers, have met with a rapid sale. And as a matter of some small chronological
interest, I must here make the record, that&mdash;</p>

<p>On the night, November Eleventh, 1844, a play taken from this book, was withdrawn
by the Managers of the Chestnut Street Theatre, because the same Mob
who with characteristic cowardice, threatened to murder the Author, declared
their intention to destroy or burn the building in case the piece was played. The
Mayor finding the arm of the civil power, too weak to protect the theatre, in a
city where churches had been laid in ashes by a Mob, preferred the more convenient
method of requesting the non-performance of the play, <i>because a Riot was
threatened</i>.</p>

<p class="small">THE WAGER IN THE OYSTER-CELLAR.</p>

</div>

<p>"I SAY, gentlemen, shall we make
a night of it? That's the question
gents. Shall we elevate the&mdash;the
devil along Chestnut Street, or shall we
subside quietly to our homes? Let's
toss up for it&mdash;which shall have the
night&mdash;brandy and oysters, or quilts
and feather-beds?" And as he spoke,
the little man broke loose from the
grasp of his friends, and retiring to the
shelter of an awning-post, flung his
cloak over his shoulder with a vast
deal of drunken dignity, while his
vacant eyes were fixed upon the convivial
group scattered along the pavement.</p>

<p>"Brandy" cried a gentleman
distinguished by a very pursy figure,
enveloped in a snow-white overcoat,

<!-- page 5 col 2 -->

and a very round face, illuminated by
a pear-shaped nose&mdash;"Brandy is a
gentleman&mdash;a per&mdash;perfect gentleman.
He leaves no head-ache next
morning by way of a card. Champagne's
a sucker&mdash;a hypocritical
scoundrel, who first goes down your
throat, smooth as oil, and then&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;very
much so&mdash;how d&mdash;&mdash;d
irregular these bricks are&mdash;puts a
powder-mill in your head and blows
it up&mdash;dam 'im!&mdash;Mem:&mdash;Byrnewood&mdash;d'ye
hear? write to the corporation
to-morrow, about these curst
mountainous pavements&mdash;" And having
thus said, the pursy gentleman retreated
to the shelter of another awning-post,
leaving the two remaining members
of the convivial party, in full
possession of the pavement, which
they laid out in any given number of
garden-plots without delay.</p>

<p>"Byrnewood&mdash;d'ye hear?" exclaimed

<!-- page 6 col 1 -->

the tallest gentleman of the
twain, gathering his frogged overcoat
closer around him, while his mustachioed
lip was wreathed in a drunken
smile&mdash;"Look yonder at the State House&mdash;sing&mdash;singular
phenomenon!
There's the original steeple and
duplicate. Two steeples, by Jupiter!
Remarkable effect of moonlight! Very&mdash;Doesn't
it strike you, Byrnewood,
that yonder watch-box is walking
across the street, to black the lamp-post's
eyes&mdash;for&mdash;for&mdash;making a
face at him?"</p>

<p>The gentleman thus addressed,
instead of replying to the sagacious
query of his friend, occupied a small
portion of his leisure time in performing
an irregular Spanish dance along
the pavement, terminating in a pleasant
combination of the cachucha, with a
genuine New Jersey double-shuffle.
This accomplished, he drew his well
proportioned figure to its full height,
cast back his cloak from his shoulders,
and turned his face to the moonlit sky.
As he gazed upon the heavens, clear,
cold, and serene as death, the moonlight
falling over his features, disclosed
a handsome though pallid face,
relieved by long curling locks of jet
black hair. For a moment he seemed
intensely absorbed amid the intricacies
of a philosophical reverie, for he frequently
put his thumb to his nose, and
described circles in the air with his
outspread fingers. At last tottering
to a seat on a fire-plug, he delivered
himself of this remarkable expression
of opinion&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miller the Prophet's right! Right
I say! The world&mdash;d&mdash;&mdash;n the plug,
how it shakes&mdash;the world is coming
to an end for certain&mdash;for, d'ye see

<!-- page 6 col 2 -->

boys&mdash;there's <i>two</i> moons shining up
yonder this blessed night sure as
fate&mdash;"</p>

<p>The scene would have furnished a
tolerable good subject for an effective
convivial picture.</p>

<p>There, seated on the doorway step
of a four storied dwelling, his arms
crossed over his muscular chest, his
right hand grasping a massive gold-headed
cane, Mr. Gustavus Lorrimer,
commonly styled the handsome Gus
Lorrimer, in especial reference to his
well-known favor among the ladies,
presented to the full glare of the
moonbeams, a fine manly countenance,
marked by a brilliant dark eye, a nose
slightly aquiline, a firm lip clothed
with a mustache, while his hat tossed
slightly to one side, disclosed a bold
and prominent forehead, relieved by
thick clusters of rich brown hair.
His dark eye at all times full of fire,
shone with a glance of unmistakeable
humor, as he regarded his friend
seated on the fire-plug directly opposite
the doorway steps.</p>

<p>This friend&mdash;Mr. Byrnewood, as
he had been introduced to Lorrimer&mdash;was
engaged in performing an extemporaneous
musical entertainment on
the top of the fire-plug with his fingers,
while his legs were entwined around
it, as though the gentleman was urging
a first-rate courser at the top of his
speed.</p>

<p>His cloak thrown back from his
shoulders, his slight though well-proportioned
and muscular form, was
revealed to the eye, enveloped in
a closely fitting black frock coat.
His face was very pale, and his long
hair, which swept in thick ringlets to
his shoulders, was dark as a ravens

<!-- page 7 col 1 -->

wing, yet his forehead was high and
massive, his features regular, and his
jet-black eye, bright as a flame-coal.
His lips, now wreathing in the very
silly smile peculiar to all worshippers
of the bottle-god, were, it is true,
somewhat slight and thin, and when
in repose inclining to severity in expression;
yet the general effect of his
countenance was highly interesting,
and his figure manly and graceful in
its outlines, although not so tall by
half-a-head as the magnificent Gus
Lorrimer.</p>

<p>While he is beating a tattoo on the
fire-plug, let us not forget our other
friends, Col. Mutchins, in his snow-white
overcoat and shiny hat; and Mr.
Sylvester J. Petriken, in his glazed
cap and long cloak, as leaning against
opposite awning posts, they gaze in
each other's faces and afford a beautiful
contrast for the pencil of our friend
Darley.</p>

<p>Col. Mutchins' face, you will observe,
is very much like a picture of a
dissipated full-moon, with a large red
pear stuck in the centre for a nose,
while two small black beads, placed
in corresponding circles of crimson
tape, supply the place of eyes. The
Colonel's figure is short, thickset, and
corpulent; he is very broad across the
shoulders, broader across the waist,
and very well developed in the region
of the hands and boots. The gentleman,
clinging nervously to the opposite
awning post, is remarkable for
three things&mdash;smallness of stature,
slightness of figure, and slimness of
legs. His head is very large, his
face remarkable for its pallor, is long
and square&mdash;looking as though it had

<!-- page 7 col 2 -->

been laid out with a rule and compass&mdash;with
a straight formal nose, placed
some distance above a wide mouth
marked by two parallel lines, in the
way of lips. His protuberant brow,
faintly relieved by irregular locks of
mole-skin colored hair, surmounted by
a high glazed cap, overarches two
large, oyster-like eyes, that roll about
in their orbits with the regularity of
machinery. These eyes remind you
of nothing more, than those glassy
things which, in obedience to a wire,
give animation to the expressive face
of a Dresden wax-doll.</p>

<p>And over this scene of quadruple
convivialism, shone the midnight moon,
her full glory beaming from a serene
winter sky, upon the roofs and
steeples of the Quaker City. The
long shadows of the houses on the
opposite side of the way, fell darkly
along the street, while in the distance,
terminating the dim perspective, arose
the State House buildings, with the
steeple shooting upward into the clear
blue sky.</p>

<p>"That champagne&mdash;" hiccupped
Mr. Petriken, clinging to the awning-post,
under a painful impression that it
was endeavoring to throw him down&mdash;"That
champagne was very strong&mdash;and
the oysters&mdash;Oh my&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As mortal beings we are subject
to sud&mdash;sudden sickness&mdash;" observed
the sententious Mutchins, gathering
his awning-post in a fonder embrace.</p>

<p>"I say, Byrnewood&mdash;how shall
we terminate the night? Did I understand
you that the d&mdash;&mdash;l was to be
raised? If so, let's start. Think how
many bells are to be pulled, how many
watch-boxes to be attacked, how many&mdash;curse

<!-- page 8 col 1 -->

the thing, I believe I'm
toddied&mdash;watchmen to be licked.
Come on boys?"</p>

<p>"Hist! Gus! You'll scare the fire-plug.
He's trying to run off with me&mdash;the
scoundrel. Wait till I put the
spurs to him, I say!"</p>

<p>"Come on boys. Let's go round
to Smokey Chiffin's oyster cellar and
have a cozy supper. Come on I say.
Take my arm, Byrnewood&mdash;there,
steady&mdash;here Petriken, never mind
the awning-post, take this other arm&mdash;now
Mutchins hook Silly's arm
and let's travel&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Mutchins&mdash;who, by the way,
had been out in a buffalo hunt the
year before&mdash;was now engaged in an
imaginary, though desperate fight
with a Sioux warrior, whom he belabored
with terrific shrieks and yells.</p>

<p>"D&mdash;&mdash;n the fool&mdash;he'll have us
all in the watch house&mdash;" exclaimed
Lorrimer, who appeared to be the
soberest of the party by several bottles&mdash;"Fun
is fun, but this thing of cutting
up shines in Chestnut Street, after
twelve, when it&mdash;keep steady Silly&mdash;amounts
to yelling like a devil in
harness is&mdash;un-un-der-stand me, no
fun. Come along, Mutchy my boy!"</p>

<p>And arm in arm, linked four
abreast, like horses very tastelessly
matched, the boon companions tottered
along Chestnut Street, toward Smokey
Chiffin's oyster cellar, where they
arrived, with but a single interruption.</p>

<p>"<i>Hao-pao-twel-o-glor-a-a-damuley-mor!</i>"</p>

<p>This mysterious combination of
sounds emanated from a stout gentleman
in a slouching hat, and four
or five overcoats, who, with a small
piece of cord-wood in his hand met

<!-- page 8 col 2 -->

our party breast to breast, as they were
speeding onward in full career.</p>

<p>"I say stranger do that over
again&mdash;will yo'?" shrieked Petriken,
turning his square face over his
shoulder and gazing at the retreating
figure with the cord stick and the
overcoats "Jist do that again if you
please. Let me go I tell you, Gus.
Don't you see, this is some dis-dis-tinguished
vocal-ist from London?
What a pathos there is in his voice&mdash;so
deep&mdash;so full&mdash;why Brough is
nothing to him! Knock Wood, and
Seg-Seguin&mdash;and Shrival&mdash;and a
dozen more into a musical cocked-hat,
and they can't equal our mys-mysterious
friend&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I say you'd better tortle on my
coveys&mdash;" cried he of the great coats
and cord stick, in a subterranean
voice&mdash;"Or p'r'aps, my fellers, ye'd
like to tend Mayor Scott's tea-party&mdash;would
ye?"</p>

<p>"Thank you kindly&mdash;" exclaimed
Gus Lorrimer in an insinuating tone,
"otherwise engaged. But my friend&mdash;if
you will allow me to ask&mdash;what
<i>do</i> you mean by that infernal noise you
produced just now? Let us into the
lark?"</p>

<p>The gentleman of the cord stick and
overcoats, was however beyond hearing
by this time, and our friends
moved on their way, Byrnewood observing
in an under tone, somewhat
roughened by hiccups, that on his
soul, he believed that queer old cove,
in the slouched hat, meant by his
mysterious noise to impart the important
truth that <i>it was half-past twelve
o'clock and a moonlight morning</i>.</p>

<p>Descending into Smokey Chiffin's
subterranean retreat, our friends were

<!-- page 9 col 1 -->

waited upon by a very small man,
with a sharp face and a white apron,
and a figure so lank and slender, that
the idea involuntarily arose to the
spectator's mind, of whole days and
nights of severe training, having been
bestowed upon a human frame, in order
to reduce it to a degree of thinness
quite visionary.</p>

<p>"Come my 'Virginia abstraction'&mdash;"
exclaimed Lorrimer&mdash;"Show us into
a private room, and tell us what
you've got for supper&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This way sir&mdash;this way gents&mdash;"
cried Smokey Chiffin, as the thin gentlemen
was rather familiarly styled&mdash;"What
got for supper? Woodcock
sir? Excellent sir. Venison sir; excellent
sir. Oysters sir, stewed, sir,
fried sir, roasted sir, or in the shell
sir. Excellent sir. Some right fresh,
fed on corn-meal sir. What have sir?
Excellent sir. This way gents&mdash;"</p>

<p>And as he thus delivered his bill of
fare, the host, attended by his customers,
disappeared from the refectory
proper, through an obscure door
into the private room.</p>

<p>There may be some of our readers
who have never been within the confines
of one of those oyster-caverns
which abound in the Quaker City.
For their especial benefit, we will endeavor
to pencil forth a few of the
most prominent characteristics of the
"Oyster Saloon by Mr. Samuel
Chiffin."</p>

<p>Lighted by flaring gas-pipes, it was
divided into two sections by a blazing
hot coal stove. The section beyond
the stove, wrapt in comparative obscurity,
was occupied by two opposing
rows of 'boxes,' looking very much
like conventual stalls, ranged side by

<!-- page 9 col 2 -->

side, for the accommodation of the
brothers of some old-time monastery.
The other section, all light, and glitter,
and show, was ornamented at its extreme
end, by a tremendous mirror,
in which a toper might look, time
after time, in order to note the various
degrees of drunkenness through which
he passed.  An oyster-box, embellished
by a glorious display of tin signs
with gilt letters, holding out inviting
manifestations of "oysters stewed fried
or in the shell," occupied one entire
side of this section, gazing directly in
the face of the liquor bar placed opposite,
garnished with an imposing array
of decanters, paint gilding, and glasses.</p>

<p>And the company gathered here?
Not very select you may be sure.
Four or five gentlemen with seedy
coats and efflorescent noses were warming
themselves around the stove, and
discussing the leading questions of the
day; two individuals whose visits to
the bar had been rather frequent, were
kneeling in one corner, swearing at a
very ragged dog, whom they couldn't
persuade to try a glass of 'Imperial
Elevator,' and seated astride of a
chair, silent and alone, a young man
whose rakish look and ruffled attire
betrayed the medical student on his
first 'spree' was endeavoring to hold
himself steady, and look uncommonly
sober; which endeavor always produces,
as everybody knows, the most
ridiculous phase of drunkenness.</p>

<p>These Oyster Cellars are queer
things. Like the caverns of old story,
in which the Giants, those ante-diluvian
rowdies, used to sit all day long,
and use the most disreputable arts to
inveigle lonely travellers into their
clutches, so these modern dens, are

<!-- page 10 col 1 -->

occupied by a jolly old Giant of a decanter,
who too often lures the unsuspecting
into his embrace. A strange
tale might be told, could the stairway
leading down into the Oyster Cellar
be gifted with the power of speech.
Here Youth has gone down laughing
merrily, and here Youth has come up,
his ruddy cheek wrinkled and his
voice quavering with premature age.
Here Wealth has gone down, and kept
going down until at last he came up
with his empty pocket, turned inside
out, and the gripe of grim starvation
on his shoulder. Here Hope, so
young, so gay, so light-hearted has
gone down, and came up transformed
into a very devil with sunken cheeks,
bleared eyes, and a cankered heart.
Oh merry cavern of the Oyster Cellar,
nestling under the ground so close to
Independence Hall, how great the
wonders, how mighty the doings, how
surprising the changes accomplished
in your pleasant den, by your jolly
old Giant of a Decanter!</p>

<p>It is here in this Oyster Cellar, that
we open the fearful tragedy which it
is the painful object of our narrative,
to tell. Here amid paint, and glitter
and gilding, amid the clink of glasses
and the roar of drinking songs, occurred
a scene, which trifling and
insipid as it may appear to the casual
observer, was but the initial letter to
a long and dreary alphabet of crime,
mystery and bloodshed.</p>

<p>In a room, small and comfortable,
lighted by gas and warmed by a
cheerful coal-fire, around a table furnished
with various luxuries, and garnished
with an array of long necked
bottles, we find our friends of the convivial
party. Their revel had swelled

<!-- page 10 col 2 -->

to the highest, glass clinked against
glass, bottle after bottle had been exhausted,
voices began to mingle together,
the drinking song and the
prurient story began to pass from lip
to lip, while our sedate friend, Smokey
Chiffin, sate silently on the sofa, regarding
the drunken bout with a glance
of quiet satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Let me see&mdash;let me see"&mdash;he
murmured quietly to himself&mdash;"Four
bottles o' Cham. at two dollars a bottle&mdash;four
times two is eight. Hum&mdash;hum.
They'll drink six more.
Let's call it twelve altogether. Say
twenty-four shiners for supper and all.
Hum&mdash;hum&mdash;Gus pays for all.
That fellow Petrikin's a sponge.
Wonder when Col. Mutchins will call
for the cards? Don't know who this
fellow Byrnewood is? New face&mdash;maybe
he's a <i>roper</i>* too? We'll
see&mdash;we'll see."</p>

<p class="small">[*This genteel term is applied to a well-dressed
edition of the vulgar stool-pigeon,
used by gamblers, to decoy the unwary into
their dens. The stool-pigeon is the loafer

<p>"Give us your hand, Gus"&mdash;cried
Byrnewood, rising from his seat
and flinging his hand unsteadily across
the table&mdash;"Damme, I like you old
fellow. Never&mdash;never&mdash;knew until
to-night&mdash;met you at Mutchins' room&mdash;wish
I'd known you all my life&mdash;Give
us your hand, my boy!"</p>

<p>Calm and magnificent, Gustavus
extended his hand, and exclaimed, in
a voice, which champagne could not
deprive of its sweetness, that it gave
him pleasure to know such a regular
bird as Mister Byrnewood; great pleasure;
extraordinary pleasure.</p>

<p>"You see, fellows, I believe I'll
take a spree for three days&mdash;won't
go home, or to the store in Front
street. Mean to keep it up until after
Christmas. Wants three days o'
Christmas&mdash;mean to jolly&mdash;ha&mdash;ha&mdash;how
the room reels."</p>

<p>"Gentle-men&mdash;I don't know what
is the matter with me&mdash;" observed
Petriken, who rested his elbows helplessly
on the table, as he looked around
with his square face, lengthened into
a vacant stare&mdash;"There's somethin'
queer a-goin' on with my eyes. I
seem to see spiders&mdash;lots o' 'em&mdash;playin'
corner-ball with roaches. See
anything o' the kind, Mutchins?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;" replied that sententious
gentleman as his red round
face was overspread by a commiserating
smile&mdash;"Why the fact is&mdash;Silly&mdash;you've
been drinkin'. By-the-bye
doesn't it strike you that there's something
queer going on with that gas
light. I say, Smokey, isn't there a
beetle tryin' to mash his brains out
against that gas-pipe?"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen&mdash;I will give you a
toast!" exclaimed Lorrimer, as he
stood erect, the bold outline of his
manly form, his handsome face, the
high forehead relieved by thick masses
of brown hair, the aquiline nose, the
rounded chin, and the curving lip
darkened by a mustache, all shown to
advantage in the glowing light&mdash;"Gentlemen
fill your glasses&mdash;no
heeltaps! WOMAN!"</p>

<p>"WOMAN!" shrieked the other
three, springing unsteadily to their
feet, and raising their glasses on high&mdash;"WOMAN!
Three times three&mdash;hip-hip-hurrah!"</p>

<p>"Women!" muttered Sylvester

<!-- page 11 col 2 -->

Petriken&mdash;"Women forever! when
we're babies she nusses us, when
we're boys she lathers us, when we're
men she bedevils and bewitches us!"</p>

<p>"Woman&mdash;" muttered Colonel
Mutchins "without her what 'ud
life be? A dickey without a 'plete,' a
collar without starch!"</p>

<p>"We can't help it if we fascinate
'em?" exclaimed Byrnewood&mdash;"Can
we Gus?"</p>

<p>"All fate, my boy&mdash;all fate. By
the bye&mdash;set down boys. I've got a
nice little adventure of my own to tell.
Smokey bring us some soda to
sober off with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen" cried Petriken,
sinking heavily in his chair "Did
any of you see the last number of my
magazine? 'The Ladies' Western
Hemisphere and Continental Organ.'
Offers the following inducements to
sub&mdash;subscribers&mdash;one fashion-plate
and two steel engravings per number&mdash;48
pages, octavo&mdash;Sylvester J.
Petriken, Editor and Proprietor, office
209 Drayman's alley, up stairs.
Damme, Mutchins, what's your idea
of fleas?"</p>

<p>There was not, it is true, the most
visible connection between the Ladies'
Continental Organ and the peculiar
insect, so troublesome to young
puppies and very small kittens, yet
as Mr. Petriken was not exactly
sober, and Col. Mutchins very far
from the temperance pledge, the idea
seemed to tickle them both immensely
and they joined in a hearty laugh,
which terminated in another glass
from a fresh bottle of champagne.</p>

<p>"Let's have your story, Gus!"
shouted Byrnewood&mdash;"Let's have
your story! Damme&mdash;life's but a

<!-- page 12 col 1 -->

porcelain cup&mdash;to-day we have it, to-morrow
we haven't&mdash;why not fill it
with sweetness?"</p>

<p>As he said this, in tones indistinct
with liquor he flung his long curling
hair back from his brow, and tossed
his glass unsteadily on high.</p>

<p>Life a porcelain cup, why not fill it
with sweetness? Great God of Mercy!
Could the terrible future, which was
to break, in a few brief hours, with all
its horrors, on the head of this young
man, who now sat unconsciously at
the drinking board, have at that moment
assumed a tangible form, it
would have stood like an incarnate
devil at his shoulder, its outstretched
hand, pouring the very gall of despair
into the cup of his life, crowding it to
the brim with the wormwood of death.</p>

<p>"Well boys for my story. It's a
story of a sweet girl, my boys&mdash;a
sweet girl about sixteen, with a large
blue eye, a cheek like a ripe peach, and
a lip like a rose-bud cleft in two&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Honor bright Gus. Damme, that's
a quotation from my last Ladies'
Western Hem. Damme Gus&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Byrnewood do hold poor Silly
down. There's this material difference,
boys, between a ripe peach or a
cleft rose-bud, and a dear little
woman's lips or cheek. A ripe peach
won't throb and grow warm if you lay
your cheek against it, and I never yet
heard of a rose-bud that kissed back
again. She's as lovely a girl as ever
trod the streets of the Quaker City.
Noble bust&mdash;slender waist&mdash;small
feet and delicate hands. Her hair?
damme, Byrnewood, you'd give your
eyes for the privilege of twining your
hands through the rich locks of her
dark brown hair&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 12 col 2 -->

<p>"Well, well, go on. Who is this
girl; uncover the mystery!"</p>

<p>"Patience, my boy, patience. A
little of that soda if you please. Now,
gentlemen, I want you to listen attentively, for
let me tell you, you don't
hear a story like mine every day in
the year."</p>

<p>Half sobered by the combined influences
of the soda water and the interest
of Lorrimer's story, Byrnewood
leaned forward, fixing his full dark
eyes intently upon the face of Gus,
who was seated opposite; while Col.
Mutchins straightened himself in his
chair, and even Petriken's vacant face
glowed with a momentary aspect of
sobriety.</p>

<p>"I see, boys, that you expect something
nice. (Smokey put some more
coal on that fire.) Well Byrnewood,
you must know I'm a devil of a fellow
among the girls&mdash;and&mdash;and d&mdash;&mdash;n
the thing, I don't know how to get at
it. Well, here goes. About two weeks
ago I was strolling along Chestnut
street towards evening, with Boney
(that's my big wolf dog, you know?)
at my heels. I was just wondering
where I should spend the evening;
whether I should go to see Forrest at
the Walnut, or take a turn round
town; when who should I see walking
ahead of me, but one of the prettiest
figures in the world, in a black silk
mantilla, with one of these saucy kiss-me-if-you-dare
bonnets on her head.
The walk of the creature, and a little
glimpse of her ankle excited my
curiosity, and I pushed ahead to get a
view of her face. By Jupiter, you
never saw such a face! so soft, so
melting, and&mdash;damme&mdash;so innocent.
She looked positively bewitching in

<!-- page 13 col 1 -->

that saucy bonnet, with her hair parted
over her forehead, and resting each
cheek in a mass of the richest curls,
that ever hung from the brow of mortal
woman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, Gus, we'll imagine all this.
She was beautiful as a houri, and
priceless as the philosopher's stone&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Byrnewood you are too impatient.
A pretty woman in a black silk mantilla,
with a lovely face peeping from
a provoking bonnet, may seem nothing
to you, but the strangest part of the
adventure is yet to come. As I looked
in the face of this lovely girl, she, to
my utter astonishment addressed me
in the softest voice in the world,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Called you by name?"</p>

<p>"No. Not precisely. It seems
she mistook me for some gentleman
whom she had seen at a country
boarding-school. I took advantage of
her mistake, walked by her side for
some squares along Chestnut Street,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Became thoroughly acquainted
with her, I suppose?" suggested
Byrnewood.</p>

<p>"Well, you may judge so, when I
mention one trifling fact for your
consideration. This night, at three
o'clock, this innocent girl, the flower
of one of the first families in the city,
forsaking home and friends, and all
that these sweet girls are wont to hold
dear, will seek repose in my arms&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She can't be <i>much</i>&mdash;" exclaimed
Byrnewood, over whose face a look
of scornful incredulity had been gathering
for some few moments past&mdash;"Pass
that champagne, Petriken my
boy. Gus, I don't mean to offend

<!-- page 13 col 2 -->

you, but I rather think you've been
humbugged by some 'slewer?' "*</p>

<p class="small">[*A cant term used by profligates for female
servants of indifferent character.]</p>

<p>A frown darkened over Lorrimer's
brow, and even as he sate, you might
see his chest heave and his form
dilate.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to doubt my word&mdash;<i>Sir?</i>"</p>

<p>"Not at all, not at all. But you
must confess, the thing looks rather
improbable. (Will you smoke, Col.?)
May I ask whether there was any
one in company with the lady when
first you met her?"</p>

<p>"A Miss something or other&mdash;I
forget her name. A very passable
beauty of twenty and upwards, and I
may add, a very convenient one, for
she carried my letters, and otherwise
favored my cause with the sweet
girl."</p>

<p>"And this 'sweet girl' is the flower
of one of the first families in the
city?" asked Byrnewood with a half-formed
sneer on his upper lip.</p>

<p>"She is&mdash;" answered Lorrimer,
lighting a cigar.</p>

<p>"And this girl, to-night, leaves
home and friends for you, and three
hours hence will repose in your
arms?"</p>

<p>"She will&mdash;" and Lorrimer vacantly
eyed a column of smoke winding
upward to the ceiling.</p>

<p>"You will not marry her?"</p>

<p>"Ha-ha-ha! You're ahead of me
now. Only a pretended marriage,
my boy. As for this 'life interest' in
a woman, it don't suit my taste. A
nice little sham marriage, my boy, is
better than ten real ones&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 14 col 1 -->

<p>"You would be a d&mdash;&mdash;d fool to
marry a woman who flung herself in
your power in this manner. How do
know she is respectable? Did you
ever visit her at her father's house?
What is her name? Do enlighten us
a little&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're 'cute, my boy, mighty 'cute,
as the Yankee says, but not so 'cute
as you think. Her name? D'ye
think I'm so particularly verdant as to
tell it? I know her name, could tell
you the figure of her father's wealth,
but have never been inside of the
threshold of her home. Secret meetings,
secret walks and even an assumed
name, are oftentimes wonderfully
convenient."</p>

<p>"Gus, here is a hundred dollar bill
on the Bank of North America. I am,
as you see, somewhat interested in
your story. I will stake this hundred
dollars that the girl who seeks your
arms to-night, is not respectable, is
not connected with one of the first
families in the city, and more than all
has never been any better than a common
lady of the sidewalk&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Book that bet, Mutchins. You
heard it, Silly. And now, Byrnewood,
here is another hundred, which I will
deposit with yours in Mutchins' hands
until the bet is decided. Come with
me and I'll prove to you that you've
lost. You shall witness the wedding&mdash;ha,
ha&mdash;and to your own sense of
honor will I confide the secret of the
lady's name and position&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The bet is booked and the money
is safe"&mdash;murmured the sententious
Mutchins, enclosing the notes in the
leaves of his pocket-book&mdash;"I've
heard of many rum go's but <i>this is</i>
the rummest go of all."</p>

<!-- page 14 col 2 -->

<p>"If I may be allowed to use the
expression, this question involves a
mystery. A decided mystery. For
instance, what's the lady's name?
There is a point from which Hypothesis
may derive some labor. 'What's
in a name'&mdash;as Shakspeare says. I
say, gents, let's pick out a dozen
names, and toss up which shall have
it?"</p>

<p>This rather profound remark of
Mr. Petriken's was received with
unanimous neglect.</p>

<p>It was observable that during this
conversation, both Lorrimer and
Byrnewood had been gradually recovering
from the effects of their debauch.
Lorrimer seemed somewhat
offended at the distrust manifested by
Byrnewood; who, in his turn, appeared
to believe the adventure just related
with very many doubts and modifications.</p>

<p>Lorrimer leaned over the table and
whispered in Sylvester's ear.</p>

<p>"Damme&mdash;damme my fellow"&mdash;murmured
Sylvester, apparently in
reply to the whispered remark of his
friend&mdash;"It cannot be done. Why
man it's a penitentiary offence."</p>

<p>Lorrimer again hissed a meaning
whisper in the ear of the little man.</p>

<p>"Well, well, as it is your wish I'll
do it. A cool fifty, did you say? You
think a dev'lish sight of the girl&mdash;do
you then? I must provide myself
with a gown and prayer book? I flatter
myself I'll rather become them&mdash;three
o'clock, did you say?"</p>

<p>"Aye&mdash;aye&mdash;" answered Lorrimer,
turning to the rubicund face of
Col. Mutchins and whispering hurriedly
in his ear.</p>

<p>A pleasant smile overspread the

<!-- page 15 col 1 -->

face of the benevolent man, and his
pear-shaped nose seemed to grow expressive
for a single moment.</p>

<p>D&mdash;&mdash;d good idea? I'll be your
too-confiding uncle? Eh? Stern but
relenting? I'll bless the union with
my benediction&mdash;<i>I'll give the bride
away?</i>"</p>

<p>"Come along Byrnewood. Here
Smokey is the money for our supper.
Mark you gentlemen, Mr. Petriken
and Col. Mutchins the hour is three
o'clock. Don't fail me, if the d&mdash;&mdash;l
himself stands in the way. Take my
arm Byrnewood and let's travel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then 'hey for the wedding.'
Daylight will tell who wins!"</p>

<p>And as they left the room arm in
arm, bound on the adventure so suddenly
undertaken, and so full of interest
and romance, Petriken looked
vacantly in Mutchins' face, and Mutchins
returned the look with a steady
gaze that seemed to say&mdash;'How
much did he give you, old boy?'</p>

<p>Whether Sylvester translated the
look in this manner, it is difficult to
tell, but certain it is, that as he poured
a bumper from a fresh bottle of champagne,
he motioned the Colonel to do
the same, and murmured in an absent
manner, or perhaps by way of a sentiment,
the remarkable words&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fifty dollars! Egad that'll buy
two steel engravings and three fashion
plates for the next number of the
Ladies' Western Hemisphere. 'Economy
is wealth,' and the best way to
learn to fly is to creep&mdash;creep very
low, remarkably low, d&mdash;&mdash;d low&mdash;<i>always
creep!</i>"</p>

<p>CHAPTER SECOND.</p>

<p class="small">MARY, THE MERCHANTS DAUGHTER.</p>

</div>

<p>LEANING gently forward, her shawl
falling carelessly from her shoulders,
and her bonnet thrown back from her
brow, the fair girl impressed a kiss on
the cheek of her father, while the
glossy ringlets of her hair mingled
their luxuriant brown with the white
locks of the kind old man.</p>

<p>The father seated on the sofa, his
hands clasping her slight and delicate
fingers, looked up into her beaming
face with a look of unspeakable affection,
while a warm glow of feeling
flushed over the pale face of the mother,
a fine matronly dame of some
forty-five, who stood gazing on her
daughter, with one hand resting on
the husband's shoulder.</p>

<p>The mild beams of an astral lamp
diffused a softened and pleasing light
through the parlor. The large mirror
glittering over the mantle, the curtains
of crimson silk depending along the
windows, the sofa on which the old
man was seated, the carpet of the
finest texture, the costly chairs, the
paintings that hung along the walls,
and in fine all the appointments of the
parlor, designated the abode of luxury
and affluence.</p>

<p>The father, who sate on the sofa
gazing in the face of his child, was a
man of some sixty years, with a fine
venerable countenance, wrinkled by
care and time, with thin locks of
snow-white hair falling along his high
pale forehead. In his calm blue eye,
looking forth from the shadow of a
thick grey eyebrow, and in the general
contour of his face, you might
trace as forcible a resemblance to his

<!-- page 16 col 1 -->

daughter, as ever was witnessed
between an old man just passing
away from life, and a fair young
girl, blooming and blushing on the
very threshold of womanhood. The
old man was clad in glossy black,
and his entire appearance, marked
the respectable merchant, who, retiring
from active business, sought
in the quietude of his own home, all
the joys, that life, wealth or affection
united and linked in blessings, have in
their power to bestow.</p>

<p>The mother, who stood resting her
hand on her husband's shoulder, was,
we have said, a fine matronly dame
of forty-five. A mild pale face, a
deep black eye, and masses of raven
hair, slightly sprinkled with the silver
threads of age, parted over a calm
forehead, and tastefully disposed beneath
a plain cap of lace, gave the
mother an appearance of sweetness
and dignity combined, that was eminently
effective in winning the respect
and love of all who looked upon her.</p>

<p>"Mary&mdash;my child&mdash;how lovely
you have grown!" exclaimed the
Merchant, in a deep quiet tone, as he
pressed her fair hands within his
own, and looked up in her face.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! You will make the
child vain&mdash;" whispered the wife
playfully, yet her face flushed with
affection, and her eyes shone an
answer to her husband's praise.</p>

<p>The girl was indeed beautiful.</p>

<p>As she stood there, in that quiet
parlor, gazing in her father's face,
she looked like a breathing picture of
youth, girlhood and innocence, painted
by the finger of God. Her face was
very beautiful. The small bonnet
thrown back from her forehead, suffered

<!-- page 16 col 2 -->

the rich curls of her brown hair
to escape, and they fell twining and
glossy along each swelling cheek, as
though they loved to rest upon the
velvet skin. The features were regular,
her lips were full red and ripe,
her round chin varied by a bewitching
dimple, and her eyes were large, blue
and eloquent, with long and trembling
lashes. You looked in those eyes,
and felt that all the sunlight of a
woman's soul was shining on you.
The face was lovely, most lovely, the
skin, soft, velvety, blooming and
transparent, the eyes full of soul, the
lips sweet with the ripeness of maidenhood,
and the brow calm and white
as alabaster, yet was there no remarkable
manifestation of thought, or
mind, or intellect visible in the lines
of that fair countenance. It was the
face of a woman formed to lean, to
cling, to love, and never to lean on but
one arm, never to cling but to one
bosom, never to love but once, and
that till death and forever.</p>

<p>The fair round neck, and well-developed
bust, shown to advantage in
the close-fitting dress of black silk,
the slender waist, and the ripening
proportions of her figure, terminated
by slight ankles and delicate feet, all
gave you the idea of a bud breaking
into bloom, a blossom ripening into
fruit, or what is higher and holier, a
pure and happy soul manifesting
itself to the world, through the rounded
outlines of a woman's form.</p>

<p>"Come, come father, you must not
detain me any longer&mdash;" exclaimed
the daughter in a sweet and low-toned
voice&mdash;"You know aunt Emily has
been teasing me these two weeks, ever
since I returned from boarding-school,

<!-- page 17 col 1 -->

to come and stay with her all night.
You know I was always a favorite
with the dear old soul. She wants to
contrive some agreeable surprise for
my birth-day, I believe. I'm sixteen
next Christmas, and that is three days
off. Do let me go, that's a good
father&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better put on your
cloak, my love?" interrupted the Mother,
regarding the daughter with a
look of fond affection&mdash;"The night is
very cold, and you may suffer from
exposure to the winter air&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no, no, no, mother&mdash;" replied
the fair girl, laughingly&mdash;"I <i>do</i> so
hate these cloaks&mdash;they're so bungling
and so heavy! I'll just fling my
shawl across my shoulders, and run
all the way to Aunt Emily's. You
know it's only two squares distant in
Third Street&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And then old Lewey will see you
safe to the door?" exclaimed the Mother&mdash;"Well,
well, go along my dear
child, take good care of yourself, and
give my love to your Aunt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"These old maids are queer things"&mdash;said
the Merchant with a smile&mdash;"Take
care Mary or Aunt Emily will
find out all your secrets&mdash;"</p>

<p>And the old man smiled pleasantly
to himself, for the idea of a girl, so
young, so innocent, having any secrets
to be found out, was too amusing to
be entertained without a smile.</p>

<p>A shade fell over the daughter's
face so sudden and melancholy that
her parents started with surprise.</p>

<p>"Why do you look so sad, my
child?" exclaimed the Father, looking
up in his daughter's face. "What is
there in the world to sadden <i>you</i>, my
Mary?"</p>

<!-- page 17 col 2 -->

<p>"Nothing, father, nothing&mdash;" murmured
Mary, flinging her form on her
father's bosom and twining her arms
round his neck as she kissed him
again and again&mdash;"Only I was thinking&mdash;just
thinking of Christmas,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The fair girl rose suddenly from
her father's bosom, and flung her arms
hurriedly around her mother's neck,
imprinting kiss after kiss on her lips.</p>

<p>"Good bye mother&mdash;I'll be back&mdash;I'll
be back&mdash;to-morrow."</p>

<p>And in an instant she glided hastily
to the door and left the room.</p>

<p>"Lewey isn't it very cold to-night?"
she asked as she observed the white-haired
negro-servant waiting in the
hall, wrapped up in an enormous overcoat,
with a comforter around his neck
and a close fur cap surmounting his
grey wool and chubby round face&mdash;"I'm
sorry to take you out in the
cold, Lewey."</p>

<p>"Bress de baby's soul&mdash;" murmured
the old negro opening the door&mdash;"Habbent
I nuss you in dese arms
when you warnt so high? Lewey
take cold? Debbil a cold dis nigger
take for no price when a-waitin' on
missa Mary&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mary stood upon the threshold of
her home looking out into the cold
starlit night. Her face was for a moment
overshadowed by an expression
of the deepest melancholy, and her
small foot trembled as it stepped over
the threshold. She looked hurriedly
along the gloomy street, then cast her
glance backwards into the entry, and
then with a wild bound she retraced
her steps, and stood beside her father
and her mother.</p>

<p>Again she kissed them, again flung

<!-- page 18 col 1 -->

her arms round their necks, and again
bounded along the entry crying laughingly
to her parents&mdash;"Good night&mdash;good
night&mdash;I'll be back to-morrow."</p>

<p>Again she stood upon the threshold,
but all traces of laughter had vanished
from her face. She was sad and silent,
and there were tears in her eyes.
At least the old negro said so afterwards,
and also that her tiny foot,
when resting on the door-sill, trembled
like any leaf.</p>

<p>Why should her eye grow dim with
tears and her foot tremble? Would
not that tiny foot, when next it crossed
the threshold, bound forward with a
gladsome movement, as the bride
sprung to meet her father and her
mother once again? Would not that
calm blue eye, now filled with tears,
grow bright with a joy before unknown,
when it glanced over the husband's
form, as for the first time he
stood in the father's presence? Would
not Christmas Eve be a merry night
for the bride and all her friends as
they went shouting merrily through
the luxuriantly furnished chambers of
her father's mansion? Why should
<i>she</i> fear to cross the threshold of her
home, when her coming back was to
be heralded with blessings and crowned
with love?</p>

<p>How will the future answer these
trembling questions of that stainless
heart?</p>

<p>She crossed the threshold, and not
daring to look back, hurried along the
gloomy street. It was clear, cold,
starlight, and the pathways were comparatively
deserted. The keen winter
wind nipped her cheek, and chilled
her form, but above her, the stars

<!-- page 18 col 2 -->

seemed smiling her onward, and she
fancied the good angels, that ever
watch over woman's first and world-trusting
love, looking kindly upon her
from the skies.</p>

<p>After traversing Third Street for
some two squares, she stood before an
ancient three-storied dwelling, at the
corner of Third and &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Streets,
with the name of 'Miss. E. Graham,'
on the door-plate.</p>

<p>"Lewey you needn't wait&mdash;" she
said kindly&mdash;yet not without a deeper
motive than kindness&mdash;to the aged
Negro who had attended her thus far&mdash;"I'll
ring the bell myself. You
had better hurry home and warm
yourself&mdash;and remember, Lewey, tell
father and mother that they need not
expect me home before to-morrow at
noon. Good night, Lewey."</p>

<p>"Good night, Missa Mary, Lor'
Moses lub your soul&mdash;" muttered the
honest old Negro, as, pulling his fur
cap over his eyes, he strode homeward&mdash;"Dat
ar babby's a angel, dat
is widout de wings. De Lor grant when
dis here ole nigger gets to yander
firmey-ment&mdash;dat is if niggers gets
dar at all&mdash;he may be 'pinted to one
ob de benches near Missa Mary, so he
can wait on her, handy as nuffin&mdash;dat's
all. She's a angel, and dis here
night, is a leetle colder dan any night
in de memory ob dat genel'man de
Fine Col'ector nebber finds&mdash;de berry
oldest inhabitant."</p>

<p>Thus murmuring, Lewey trudged
on his way, leaving Mary standing in
front of Aunt Emily's door. Did she
pull the bell? I trow not, for no
sooner was the negro out of sight, than
the tall figure of a woman, dressed in
black, with a long veil drooping over

<!-- page 19 col 1 -->

her face, glided round the corner and
stood by her side.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;Bessie&mdash;is that you?"
cried Mary, in a trembling voice&mdash;"I'm
so frightened I don't know what
to do&mdash;Oh Bessie&mdash;Bessie don't you
think I had better turn back&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> waits for you&mdash;" said the
strange woman, in a husky voice.</p>

<p>Mary hurriedly laid her hand on the
stranger's arm. Her face was overspread
with a sudden expression of
feeling, like a gleam of sunshine, seen
through a broken cloud on a stormy
day, and in a moment, they were
speeding down Third Street toward
the southern districts of the Quaker
City. Another moment, and the eye
might look for them in vain.</p>

<p>And as they disappeared the State
House clock rung out the hour of
nine. This, as the reader will perceive,
was just four hours previous to
the time when Byrnewood and Lorrimer
closed their wager in the subterranean
establishment along Chestnut
Street. To the wager and its result
we now turn our attention and the
reader's interest.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br/>

<p>CHAPTER THIRD.</p>

<p class="small">BYRNEWOOD AND LORRIMER.</p>

</div>

<p>THE harsh sound of their footsteps,
resounding along the frozen pavement,
awoke the echoes of the State House
buildings, as linked arm in arm, Byrnewood
and Lorrimer hurried along
Chestnut Street, their figures thrown in
lengthened shadow by the beams of
the setting moon.</p>

<!-- page 19 col 2 -->

<p>The tall, manly and muscular figure
of Lorrimer, attired in a close-fitting
black overcoat, presented a fine contrast
to the slight yet well-proportioned
form of Byrnewood, which now and
then became visible as the wind flung
his voluminous cloak back from his
shoulders. The firm and measured
stride of Lorrimer, the light and agile
footstep of Byrnewood, the glowing
countenance of the magnificent Gus,
the pale solemn face of the young
Merchant, the rich brown hair which
hung in clustering masses around the
brow of the first, and the long dark
hair which fell sweeping to the very
shoulders of his companion, all
furnished the details of a vivid contrast,
worthy the effective portraiture
of a master in our sister-art.</p>

<p>"Almost as cold as charity, Byrnewood
my boy&mdash;" exclaimed Lorrimer,
as he gathered Byrnewood's arm
more closely within his own&mdash;"Do
you know, my fellow, that I believe
vastly in faces?"</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"I can tell a man's character from
his face, the moment I clap my eye
on him. I like or dislike at first sight.
Now there's Silly Petriken's face
how do you translate it?"</p>

<p>"The fact is, Lorrimer, I know
very little about him. I was introduced
to him, for the first time, at a
party, where he was enrapturing some
sentimental old maids, with a few
quires of sonnets on everything in
general. Since that occasion I have
never met him, until to-night, when
he hailed me in Chestnut Street, and
forced me into Mutchins' room at the
United States Hotel. You know the
rest&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 20 col 1 -->

<p>"Well, well, with regard to Petriken,
a single word. Clever fellow,
clever, but like Mutchins, he sells for
a reasonable price. I buy them both.
By Jupiter! the town swarms with such
fellows, who will sell themselves to
any master for a trifle. Petriken&mdash;poor
fellow&mdash;his face indicates his
character&mdash;a solemn pimp, a sententious
parasite. Mutchins is just the
other way&mdash;an agreeable jolly old-dog
of a pander. They hire themselves
to me for the season&mdash;I use
and, of course, despise them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your remarks are truly flattering
to these worthy gentlemen!" said
Byrnewood, drily.</p>

<p>"And now my fellow, you may
think me insincere, but I tell you
frankly, that the moment I first saw
your face, I liked you, and resolved
you should be my friend. For your
sake I am about to do a thing which
I would do for no living man, and
possibly no dead one&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And that is&mdash;" interrupted Byrnewood.</p>

<p>"Just listen my fellow. Did you
ever hear any rumors of a queer old
house down town, kept by a reputable
old lady, and supported by the purses
of goodly citizens, whose names you
never hear without the addition of
'respectable,' 'celebrated,' or&mdash;ha&mdash;ha&mdash;'pious'&mdash;<i>most</i>
'pious?' A
queer old house my good fellow,
where, during the long hours of the
winter nights, your husband, so kind
and good, forgets his wife, your merchant
his ledger, your lawyer his
quibbles, your parson his prayers? A
queer old house, my good fellow,
where wine and woman mingle their
attractions, where at once you sip the

<!-- page 20 col 2 -->

honey from a red-lip, and a sparkling
bubble from the champagne? Where
luxuriantly-furnished chambers resound
all night long with the rustling
of cards, or the clink of glasses, or&mdash;it
may be&mdash;the gentle ripple of
voices, murmuring in a kiss? A
queer old house, my dear fellow, in
short, where the very devil is played
under a cloak, and sin grows fat within
the shelter of quiet rooms and impenetrable
walls&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;Lorrimer you are eloquent!
Faith, I've heard some rumors
of such a queer old house, but always
deemed them fabulous&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The old house is a fact, my boy,
a fact. Within its walls this night I
will wed my pretty bride, and within
its walls, my fellow, despite the pains
and penalties of our Club, you shall
enter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I should like it of all things in the
world. How is your club styled?"</p>

<p>"All in good time, my friend. Each
member, you see, once a week, has
the privilege of introducing a friend.
The same friend must never enter
the Club House twice. Now I have
rather overstepped the rules of the
Club in other respects&mdash;it will require
all my tact to pass you in to-night.
It shall be done, however&mdash;and mark
me&mdash;you will obtain a few fresh ideas
of the nature of the <i>secret life</i> of this
good Quaker City&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why Lorrimer&mdash;" exclaimed
Byrnewood, as they approached the
corner of Eighth and Chestnut&mdash;"You
seem to have a pretty good idea of
life in general&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Life?" echoed the magnificent
Gus, in that tone of enthusiasm peculiar
to the convivialist when recovering

<!-- page 21 col 1 -->

from the first excitement of the
bottle&mdash;"Life? What is it? As
brilliant and as brief as a champagne
bubble! To-day a jolly carouse in an
oyster cellar, to-morrow a nice little
picnic party in a graveyard. One
moment you gather the apple, the
next it is ashes. Everything fleeting
and nothing stable, everything shifting
and changing, and nothing substantial!
A bundle of hopes and fears,
deceits and confidences, joys and
miseries, strapped to a fellow's back
like Peddler's wares&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Huzza! Bravo&mdash;the Reverend
Gus Lorrimer preaches. And what
moral does your reverence deduce
from all this!"</p>

<p>"One word, my fellow&mdash;ENJOY!
Enjoy till the last nerve loses its delicacy
of sense; enjoy till the last sinew
is unstrung; enjoy till the eye flings out
its last glance, till the voice cracks and
the blood stagnates; <i>enjoy</i>, always
<i>enjoy</i>, and at last&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye&mdash;that terrible <i>at last</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At last, when you can enjoy no
longer, creep into a nice cozy house,
some eight feet deep, by six long and
two wide, wrap yourself up in a comfortable
quilt of white, and tell the
worms&mdash;those jolly gleaners of the
scraps of the feast of life&mdash;that they
may fall to and be d&mdash;&mdash;d to 'em&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;Lorrimer! Who
would have thought this of you?"</p>

<p>"Tell me, my fellow, what business
do you follow?"</p>

<p>"Rather an abrupt question. However,
I'm the junior partner in the
importing house of Livingston, Harvey,
&amp; Co., along Front Street&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I&mdash;" replied Gustavus slowly

<!-- page 21 col 2 -->

and with deliberation&mdash;"And I am
junior and senior partner in a snug
little wholesale business of my own.
The firm is Lorrimer, &amp; Co.&mdash;the
place of business is everywhere about
town&mdash;and the business itself is enjoyment,
nothing but enjoyment;
wine and woman forever! And as
for the capital I've an unassuming
sum of one hundred thousand dollars,
am independent of all relations, and
bid fair to live at least a score of years
longer. Now my fellow, you know
me&mdash;come, spice us up a few of your
own secrets. Have you no interesting
little <i>amour</i> for my private ear?"</p>

<p>"By Heaven, I'd forgotten all about
it!" cried Byrnewood starting aside
from his companion as they stood in
the full glare of the gas-lamp at the
corner of Eighth and Chestnut Street&mdash;"I'd
forgotten all about the letter!"</p>

<p>"The letter? What letter?"</p>

<p>"Why just before Petriken hailed
me in Chestnut Street this evening&mdash;or
rather <i>last</i> evening a letter was
placed in my hands, which I neglected
to read. I know the hand-writing on
the direction, however. It's from a
dear little love of a girl, who, some six
months ago, was a servant in my
father's house. A sweet girl, Lorrimer&mdash;and&mdash;you
know how these
things work&mdash;she was lovely, innocent
and too confiding, and I was but
a&mdash;man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And she a 'slewer.' Rather a
low walk of business for <i>you</i>, my boy!
However, let's read the letter by lamp-light&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here it is&mdash;'Dear Byrnewood&mdash;I
would like very much to see you to-night.
I am in great distress. Meet
me at the corner of Fourth and Chestnut

<!-- page 22 col 1 -->

streets at nine o'clock or you will
regret it to the day of your death. Oh
for God's sake do meet me&mdash;Annie.'
What a pretty hand she writes&mdash;Eh!
Lorrimer! That '<i>for God's sake</i>' is
rather cramped&mdash;and&mdash;egad! there's
the stain of a tear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"These things are quite customary.
These letters and these tears. The
dear little women can only use these
arguments when they yield too much
to our persuasions&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And yet&mdash;d&mdash;&mdash;n the thing&mdash;how
unfortunate for the girl my acquaintance
has proved! She had to
leave my father's house on account of&mdash;of&mdash;the
<i>circumstance</i> becoming
too apparent, and her parents are very
poor. I should have liked to have
seen her to-night. However, it will
do in the morning. And now, Lorrimer,
which way?"</p>

<p>"To the 'queer old house' down
town. By-the-bye, there goes the
State House&mdash;one o'clock, by Jupiter!
We've two good hours yet to
decide the wager. Let's spend half
an hour in a visit to a certain friend
of mine. Here, Byrnewood, let me
instruct you in the mysteries of the
'lark'&mdash;"</p>

<p>And, leaning aside, the magnificent
Gus whispered in the ear of his friend
with as great an appearance of mystery
as the most profound secret might be
supposed to demand.</p>

<p>"Do you take, my fellow?"</p>

<p>"Capital, capital&mdash;" replied Byrnewood,
crushing the letter into his
pocket&mdash;"We shall crowd this night
with adventures&mdash;that's certain!"</p>

<p>The dawn of daylight&mdash;it is true&mdash;closed
the accounts of a night
somewhat crowded with incidents.

<!-- page 22 col 2 -->

Did these merry gentlemen who stood
laughing so cheerily at the corner of
Eighth and Chestnut Streets, at the hour
of one, their faces glowing in the light
of the midnight moon, did they guess
the nature of the incidents which five
o'clock in the morning could disclose?
God of Heaven&mdash;might no angel of
mercy drop from the skies and warn
them back in their career?</p>

<p>No warning came, no omen scared
them back. Passing down Eighth
Street, they turned up Walnut, which
they left at Thirteenth. Turning down
Thirteenth they presently stood before
a small old fashioned two storied
building, with a green door and a bulk
window, that occupied nearly the entire
width of the front, protruding in
the light. A tin sign, placed between
the door and window, bore the inscription,
"*. *****, ASTROLOGER."</p>

<p>"Wonder if the old cove's in bed&mdash;"
exclaimed Lorrimer, and as he spoke
the green door opened, as if in answer
to his question, and the figure of a man,
muffled up in the thick folds of a cloak
with his hat drawn over his eyes,
glided out of the Astrologer's house,
and hurried down Thirteenth Street.</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;devilish cunning, but
not so cunning as he thinks!" laughed
Byrnewood&mdash;"I saw his face&mdash;it's
old Grab-and-Snatch, the President of
the &mdash;&mdash; Bank, which everybody
says is on the eve of a grand blow-up!"</p>

<p>"The respectable old gentleman
has been consulting the stars with regard
to the prospects of his bank&mdash;ha&mdash;ha!
However, my boy, the
door is open&mdash;let's enter! Let's
consult this familiar of the fates, this
intimate acquaintance of the Future!"</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br/>

<p>CHAPTER FOURTH.</p>

<p class="small">THE ASTROLOGER.</p>

</div>

<p>IN a small room, remarkable for
the air of comfort imparted by the
combined effects of the neatly white-washed
walls, the floor, plainly carpeted,
and the snug little wood-stove
roaring in front of the hearth, sat
a man of some forty-five winters,
bending over the table in the corner,
covered with strange-looking books
and loose manuscripts.</p>

<p>The light of the iron lamp which
stood in the centre of the table, resting
on a copy of Cornelius Agrippa, fell
full and strongly over the face and
form of the Astrologer, disclosing
every line of his countenance, and
illumining the corner where he sat,
while the more distant parts of the
room were comparatively dim and
shadowy.</p>

<p>As he sat in the large old-fashioned
arm-chair, bending down earnestly
over a massive manuscript, covered
with strange characters and crossed
by intricate lines, the lamp-beams disclosed
a face, which somewhat plain
and unmeaning in repose, was now
agitated by an expression of the deepest
interest. The brow, neither very
high nor very low, shaded by tangled
locks of thin brown hair, was corrugated
with deep furrows, the eyebrows
were firmly set together, the
nostrils dilated, and the lips tightly
compressed, while the full grey eyes,
staring vacantly on the manuscript,
indicated by the glassy film spread
over each pupil, that the mind of the
Astrologer, instead of being occupied
with outward objects, was buried within

<!-- page 23 col 2 -->

itself, in the contemplation of some
intricate subject of thought.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the dress of
the man, or in the appearance of his
room, that might realize the ideas
commonly attached to the Astrologer
and his den. Here were no melodramatic
curtains swinging solemnly
to and fro, brilliant and terrible with
the emblazoned death's-head and cross-bones.
Here were no blue lights
imparting a lurid radiance to a row of
grinning skeletons, here were no
ghostly forms standing pale and erect,
their glassy eyes freezing the spectator's
blood with horror, here was
neither goblin, devil, or mischievous
ape, which, as every romance reader
knows, have been the companions of
the Astrologer from time immemorial;
here was nothing but a plain man,
seated in an old-fashioned arm-chair,
within the walls of a comfortable room,
warmed by a roaring little stove.</p>

<p>No cap of sable relieved the Astrologer's
brow, no gown of black velvet,
tricked out with mysterious emblems
in gold and precious stones, fell in
sweeping folds around the outlines of
his spare figure. A plain white overcoat,
much worn and out at the elbows,
a striped vest not remarkable for its
shape or fashion, a cross-barred neckerchief,
and a simple linen shirt collar
completed the attire of the astrologer
who sat reading at the table.</p>

<p>The walls of the room were hung
with the Horoscopes of illustrious
men, Washington, Byron, and Napoleon,
delineated on large sheets of
paper, and surrounded by plain frames
of black wood; the table was piled
with the works of Sibly, Lilly, Cornelius
Agrippa and other masters in

<!-- page 24 col 1 -->

the mystic art; while at the feet of
the Astrologer nestled a fine black cat,
whose large whiskers and glossy fur,
would seem to afford no arguments in
favor of the supposition entertained by
the neighbors, that she was a devil in
disguise, a sort of familiar spirit on
leave of absence from the infernal regions.</p>

<p>"I'm but a poor man&mdash;" said the
Astrologer, turning one of the leaves
of the massive volume in manuscript
which he held in his hand&mdash;"I'm
but a poor man, and the lawyer, and
the doctor, and the parson all despise
me, and yet&mdash;" his lip wreathed with
a sneering smile&mdash;"this little room
has seen them all within its walls,
begging from the humble man some
knowledge of the future! Here they
come one and all the fools, pretending
to despise my science, and yet
willing to place themselves in my
power, while they affect to doubt.
Ha-ha&mdash;here are their Nativities one
and all&mdash;That" he continued, turning
over a leaf&mdash;"is the Horoscope
of a clergyman&mdash;Holy man of God!&mdash;He
wanted to know whether he
could ruin an innocent girl in his congregation
without discovery. And
that is the Horoscope of a lawyer, who
takes fees from both sides. His desire
is to know, whether he can perjure
himself in a case now in court without
detection. Noble counsellor! This
Doctor&mdash;" and he turned over another
leaf&mdash;"told me that he had a delicate
case in hand. A pretty girl has
been ruined and so on&mdash;the seducer
wants to destroy the fruit of his crime
and desires the doctor to undertake
the job. Doctor wants to know what
moment will be auspicious&mdash;ha-ha!"

<!-- page 24 col 2 -->

And thus turning from page to page,
he disclosed the remarkable fact, that
the great, the good, and the wise of
the Quaker City, who met the mere
name of astrology, when uttered in
public, with a most withering sneer,
still under the cover of night, were
happy to steal to the astrologer's
room, and obtain some glimpses of
their future destiny through the oracle
of the stars.</p>

<p>"A black-eyed woman&mdash;lusty and
amorous&mdash;wants to know whether
she can present her husband with a
pair of horns on a certain night? I
warned her not to proceed in her
course of guilt. She does proceed&mdash;and
will be exposed to her husband's
hate and public scorn&mdash;"</p>

<p>And thus murmuring, the Astrologer
turned to another leaf.</p>

<p>"The Horoscope of a puppy-faced
editor! A spaniel, a snake, and an
ape&mdash;he is a combination of the three.
Wants to know when he can run off
with a lady of the <i>ballet</i> at the theatre,
without being caught by his creditors?
Also, whether next Thursday is an
auspicious day for a little piece of
roguery he has in view? The penitentiary
looms darkly in the distance&mdash;let
the editor of the 'DAILY BLACK
MAIL' beware&mdash;"</p>

<p>Another leaf inscribed with a distinguished
name, arrested the Astrologer's
attention.</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;ha! This fellow is a man
of fashion, a buck of Chestnut Street,
and&mdash;and a Colonel! He lives&mdash;<i>I</i>
know <i>how</i>&mdash;the fashionables who
follow in his wake don't <i>dream</i> of his
means of livelihood. He has committed
a crime&mdash;an astounding crime&mdash;wants
to know whether his associate

<!-- page 25 col 1 -->

will betray him? I told him <i>he</i>
would. The Colonel laughed at me,
although he paid for the knowledge.
In a week the fine, sweet, perfumed
gentleman will be lodged at public expense&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Astrologer laid down the
volume, and in a moment seemed to
have fallen into the same train of
thought, marked by the corrugated
brow and glassy eye, that occupied
his mind at the commencement of
this scene. His lips moved tremulously,
and his hands ever and anon were
pressed against his wrinkled brow.
Every moment his eye grew more
glassy, and his mouth more fixedly
compressed, and at last, leaning his
elbows on the table with his hands
nervously clasped, his gaze was fixed
on the blank wall opposite, in a wild
and vacant stare that betrayed the
painful abstraction of his mind from
all visible objects.</p>

<p>And as he sat there enwrapt in
thought, a footstep, inaudible to his
ear, creaked on the stairway that ascended
into the Astrologer's chamber
from the room below, and in a moment,
silent and unperceived, Gus Lorrimer
stood behind his chair, looking
over his head, his very breath hushed
and his hands upraised.</p>

<p>"In all my history I remember
nothing half so strange. All is full of
light except one point of the future,
and that is dark as death!" Thus
ran the murmured soliloquy of the
Astrologer&mdash;"And yet they will be
here to-night&mdash;here&mdash;here both of
them, or there's no truth in the stars.
Lorrimer must beware&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha&mdash;" laughed a bold

<!-- page 25 col 2 -->

and manly voice&mdash;"An old stage
trick, that. You didn't hear my footsteps
on the stairs&mdash;did you? Oh no&mdash;oh
no. Of course you didn't.
Come&mdash;come, my old boy, that clap-trap
mention of my name, is rather
too stale, even for a three-fipenny-bit
melo-drama&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sudden start which the Astrologer
gave, the unaffected look of surprise
which flashed over his features
at the sight of the gentleman of pleasure,
convinced Lorrimer that he had
done him rank injustice.</p>

<p>"Sit down, sir&mdash;I have much to
say to you&mdash;" said the Astrologer, in
a voice strikingly contrasted with his
usual tone, it was so deep, so full and
so calmly deliberate&mdash;"Last Thursday
morning at this hour you gave
me the day and hour of your birth.
You wished me to cast your horoscope.
You wished to know whether
you would be successful in an enterprise
which you meditated. Am I correct
in this?"</p>

<p>"You are, my old humbug&mdash;that
is my <i>friend</i>&mdash;" replied Lorrimer,
flinging himself into a seat.</p>

<p>"Humbug?" cried the other with a
quiet sneer&mdash;"You may alter your
opinion after a-while, my young friend.
Since last Thursday morning I have
given the most careful attention to
your horoscope. It is one of the most
startling that ever I beheld. You were
born under one of the most favorable
aspects of the heavens, born, it would
seem, but to succeed in all your
wishes; and yet your future fate is
wrapt in some terrible mystery&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Like a kitten in a wet blanket, for
instance?" said Lorrimer, in the vain

<!-- page 26 col 1 -->

endeavor, to shake off a strange feeling
of awe, produced by the manner
of the Astrologer.</p>

<p>"This night I was occupied with
your horoscope when a strange circumstance
attracted my attention.
Even while I was examining book
after book, in the effort to see more
clearly into your future, I discovered
that you were making a new acquaintance
at some festival, some wine-drinking
or other affair of the kind.
This new acquaintance is a man with
a pale face, long dark hair and dark
eyes. So the stars tell me. Your fate
and the fate of this young man are
linked together till death. So the
heavens tell me, and the heavens
never lie."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;my friend, very
good&mdash;" replied Gustavus with a
smile&mdash;"Very good, my dear sir.
Your conclusions are perfect&mdash;your
prophetic gift without reproach. But
you forget one slight circumstance:
I have made no new acquaintance to-night!
I have been at no wine-drinking!
I have seen no interesting young
man with a pale face and long dark
hair&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then my science is a lie!" exclaimed
the Astrologer, with a puzzled
look&mdash;"The stars declare that this
very night, you first came in contact
with the man, whose fate henceforth is
linked with your own. The future
has a doom in store for one of ye.
The stars do not tell me which shall
feel the terror of the doom, but that it
will be inflicted by one of ye upon the
other, is certain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, let us suppose, for the sake
of argument, that I did meet this

<!-- page 26 col 2 -->

mysterious young man with long black
hair. What follows?"</p>

<p>"Three days ago, a young man,
whose appearance corresponds with
the indication given by the stars of the
new acquaintance you were to make
this very night, came to me and desired
me to cast his horoscope. The
future of this young man, is as like
yours as night is to-night. He too is
threatened with a doom either to be
suffered or inflicted. This doom will
lower over his head within three days.
At the hour of sunset on next Saturday&mdash;Christmas
Eve&mdash;a terrible
calamity will overtake him. At the
same hour, and in the same manner,
a terrible calamity will blacken your
life forever. The same doubt prevails
in both cases&mdash;whether you will endure
this calamity in your own person,
or be the means of inflicting its
horrors on some other man, doomed
and fated by the stars&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What connection has this young
man with the 'new acquaintance'
which you say I have formed to-night?"</p>

<p>"I suspect that this young man
and your new acquaintance are <i>one</i>.
If so, I warn you, by your soul,
beware of him&mdash;this stranger to you!"</p>

<p>"And why <i>beware</i> of <i>me?</i>" said a
calm and quiet voice at the shoulder
of the Astrologer.</p>

<p>As though a shell had burst in the
centre of that quiet room, he started,
he trembled, and arose to his feet.
Byrnewood, the young merchant,
calm and silent, stood beside him.</p>

<p>"I warn ye," he shrieked in a
tone of wild excitement, with his grey
eyes dilating and flashing beneath

<!-- page 27 col 1 -->

the woven eyebrows&mdash;"I warn ye
both&mdash;beware of each other! Let
this meeting at my house be your last
on earth, and ye are saved! Meet
again, or pursue any adventure together,
and ye are lost and lost forever!
I tell ye, scornful men that ye
are, that ask my science to aid you,
and then mock its lessons, I tell ye,
by the Living God who writes his
will, in letters of fire on the wide scroll
of the firmament, that in the hand of
the dim Future is a Goblet steeped in
the bitterness of death, and that goblet
one or the other must drink, within
three little days!"</p>

<p>And striding wildly along the room,
while Byrnewood stood awed, and
even the cheek of Lorrimer grew
pale, he gave free impulse to one of
those wild deliriums of excitement
peculiar to his long habits of abstraction
and thought. The full truth, the
terrible truth, seemed crowding on his
brain, arrayed in various images of
horror, and he shrieked forth his interpretation
of the future, in wild and
broken sentences.</p>

<p>"Young man, three days ago you
sought to know the future. You had
never spoken to the man who sits in
yonder chair. I cast your horoscope&mdash;I
found your destiny like the destiny
of this man who affects to sneer
at my science. My art availed me no
further. I could not identify you with
the man who first met Lorrimer this
night, amid revelry and wine. Now
I can supply the broken chain. You
and his new-formed acquaintance are
<i>one</i>. And now the light of the stars
breaks more plainly on me&mdash;<i>within
three days, one of you will die by the
other's hand</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 27 col 2 -->

<p>Lorrimer slowly arose to his feet,
as though the effort gave him pain.
His cheek was pale, and beaded drops
of sweat stood on his brow. His
parted lips, his upraised hands and
flashing eyes attested his interest in
the astrologer's words. Meanwhile,
starting suddenly aside, Byrnewood
veiled his face in his hands, as his
breast swelled and quivered with sudden
emotion.</p>

<p>Stern and erect, in his plain white
overcoat, untricked with gold or gems,
stood the Astrologer, his tangled brown
hair flung back from his brow, while,
with his outstretched hand and flashing
eye, he spoke forth the fierce
images of his brain.</p>

<p>"Three days from this, as the sun
goes down, on Christmas eve, one of
you will die by the other's hand. As
sure as there is a God in Heaven, his
stars have spoken, and it will be so!"</p>

<p>"What will be the manner of <i>the
death?</i>" exclaimed Lorrimer, in a
low-toned voice, as he endeavored to
subdue the sudden agitation inspired
by the Astrologer's words, while
Byrnewood raised his head and awaited
the answer with evident interest.</p>

<p>"There is the cloud and the mystery&mdash;"
exclaimed the Astrologer,
fixing his eye on vacancy, while his
outstretched hand trembled like a leaf
in the wind&mdash;"The death will overtake
the doomed man on a river, and
yet it will not be by water; it will kill
him by means of fire and yet he will
not perish in the midst of flames&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a dead pause for a single
instant. There stood the Astrologer,
his features working as with a convulsive
spasm, the light falling boldly
over his slight figure and homely attire,

<!-- page 28 col 1 -->

and there at his side, gazing in his
face, stood Byrnewood, the young
merchant, silent as if a spell had fallen
on him, while on the other side, Gustavus
Lorrimer, half recoiling, his
brow woven in a frown, and his dark
eyes flashing with a strange glance,
seemed making a fearful effort to command
his emotion, and dispel the gloom
which the wierd prophecy had flung
over his soul.</p>

<p>"Pah! What fools we are! To
stand here listening to the ravings of
a madman or a knave&mdash;" cried
Byrnewood, with a forced laugh, as
he shook off the spell that seemed to
bind him&mdash;"What does he know of
the future&mdash;more than we? Eh?
Lorrimer? Perhaps, sir, since you
are so familiar with fate, destiny and
all that, you can tell us the nature of
the adventure on which Lorrimer is
bound to-night?"</p>

<p>The Astrologer turned and looked
upon him. There was something so
calmly scornful in his glance, that
Byrnewood averted his eyes.</p>

<p>"The adventure is connected with
the honor of an innocent woman&mdash;"
said the Astrologer "More than this
I know not, save that a foul outrage
will be done this very night. And&mdash;hark
ye sir&mdash;either the heavens are
false, or your future destiny hangs
upon this adventure. Give up the adventure
at once, go back in your
course, part from one another, part
this moment never to meet again, and
you will be saved. Advance and you
are lost!"</p>

<p>Lorrimer stood silent, thoughtful
and pale as death. It becomes me not
to look beyond the veil that hangs between
the Visible and the Invisible, but

<!-- page 28 col 2 -->

it may be, that in the silent pause of
thought which the libertine's face manifested,
his soul received some indications
of the future from the very
throne of God. Men call these sudden
shadows, presentiments; to the eyes of
angels they may be, but messages of
warning spoken to the soul, in the
spirit-tongues of those awful beings
whose habitation is beyond the threshold
of time. What did Lorrimer behold
that he stood so silent, so pale,
so thoughtful? Did Christmas Eve,
and the River, and the Death, come
terrible and shadow-like to his soul?</p>

<p>"Pshaw! Lorrimer you are not
frightened by the preachings of this
fortune-teller?" cried Byrnewood with
a laugh and a sneer&mdash;"You will not
give up the girl? Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;scared
by an owl! Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;What would
Petriken say? Imagine the rich laugh
of Mutchins&mdash;ha&mdash;ha&mdash;Gus Lorrimer
scared by an owl!"</p>

<p>"Give up the girl?" cried Lorrimer,
with a blasphemous oath, that profaned
the name of the Savior&mdash;"Give
up the girl? Never! She
shall repose in my arms before daylight!
Heaven nor hell shall scare
me back! There's your money Mister
Fortune Teller&mdash;your croaking deserves
the silver, the d&mdash;&mdash;l knows!
Come on Byrnewood&mdash;let us away."</p>

<p>"Wait till I pay the gentleman for
our coffins&mdash;" laughed Byrnewood,
flinging some silver on the table&mdash;"See
that they're ready by Saturday
night, old boy? D'ye mind? You
are hand-in-glove with some respectable
undertaker&mdash;no doubt&mdash;and can
give him our measure. Good bye&mdash;old
fellow&mdash;good bye! Now, Lorrimer,
away&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 29 col 1 -->

<p>"Away, away to Monk-Hall!"</p>

<p>And in a moment they had disappeared
down the stairway, and were
passing through the lower room toward
the street.</p>

<p>"On Christmas Eve, at the hour of
sunset&mdash;" shrieked the Astrologer,
his features convulsed with anger, and
his voice wild and piercing in its tones&mdash;"One
of you will die by the other's
hand! The winding sheet is woven,
and the coffin made&mdash;you are rushing
madly on your doom!"</p>

<p>CHAPTER FIFTH.</p>

<p class="small">DORA LIVINGSTONE.</p>

</div>

<p>IT was a nice cozy place, that old
counting-house room, with its smoky
walls, its cheerful coal-fire burning in
the rusty grate, and its stained and
blackened floor. A snug little room,
illuminated by a gas-light, subdued to
a shadowy and sleepy brilliancy, with
the Merchant's Almanac and four or
five old pictures scattered along the
walls, an old oaken desk with immense
legs, all carved and curled into
a thousand shapes, standing in one
corner, and a massive door, whose
glass window opened a mysterious
view into the regions of the warehouse,
where casks of old cogniac lay,
side by side, in lengthened rows, like
jolly old fellows at a party, as they
whisper quietly to one another on the
leading questions of the day.</p>

<p>Seated in front of the coal fire,
his legs elevated above his head, resting
on the mantel-piece, a gentleman,
of some twenty-five years, with his

<!-- page 29 col 2 -->

arms crossed and a pipe in his mouth,
seemed engaged in an earnest endeavor
to wrap himself up in a cloak of
tobacco smoke, in order to prepare for
a journey into the land of Nod, while
the tumbler of punch standing on the
small table at his elbow, showed that
he was by no means opposed to that
orthodox principle which recognizes
the triple marriage of brandy, lemon
and sugar, as a highly necessary addition
to the creature comforts of the
human being, in no way to be despised
or neglected by thinking men.</p>

<p>You would not have called this gentleman
well-proportioned, and yet his
figure was long and slender, you could
not have styled his dress eminently
fashionable, and yet his frock coat was
shaped of the finest black cloth, you
would not have looked upon his face
as the most handsome in the world,
and yet it was a finely-marked countenance,
with a decided, if not highly
intellectual, expression. If the truth
must be told, his coat, though fashioned
of the finest cloth, was made a little
too full in one place, a little too
scant in another, and buttoned up
somewhat too high in the throat, for a
gentleman whose ambition it was
flourish on the southern side of Chestnut
Street, amid the animated cloths
and silks of a fashionable promenade.
And then the large black stock, encircling
his neck, with the crumpled,
though snow-white collar, gave
a harsh relief to his countenance,
while the carelessly-disposed wristbands,
crushed back over the upturned
cuffs of his coat, designated the man
who went in for comfort, and flung
fashion to the haberdashers and dry
goods clerks.</p>

<!-- page 30 col 1 -->

<p>As for his face, whenever the curtain
of tobacco smoke rolled aside, you
beheld, as I have said, a finely-marked
countenance, with rather lank cheeks,
a sharp aquiline nose, thin lips, biting
and sarcastic in expression, a full
square chin, and eyes of the peculiar
class, intensely dark and piercing in
their glance, that remind you of a
flame without heat, cold, glittering and
snake-like. His forehead was high
and bold, with long and lanky black
hair falling back from its outlines, and
resting, without love-lock or curl, in
straight masses behind each ear.</p>

<p>"Queer world this!" began our
comfortable friend, falling into one of
those broken soliloquies, generated by
the pipe and the bowl, in which the
stops are supplied by puffs of smoke,
and the paragraph terminated by a sip
of the punch&mdash;"Don't know much
about other worlds, but it strikes me
that if a prize were offered somewhere
by somebody, for the queerest world
a-going, this world of ours might be
rigged up nice, and sent in like a bit
of show beef, as the premium queer
world. No man smokes a cigar that
ever tried a pipe, but an ass. I was
a small boy once&mdash;ragged little devil
<i>that</i> Luke Harvey, who used to run
about old Livingstone's importing
warehouse. Indelicate little fellow:
wore his ruffles out behind. Kicked
and cuffed because he was poor&mdash;served
him right&mdash;dammim. Old
Liv. died&mdash;young Albert took the
store capital, cool one hundred
thousand. Luke Harvey rose to a
clerkship. Began to be a fine fellow&mdash;well-dressed,
and of course virtuous.
D&mdash;&mdash;d queer fellow, Luke.
Last year taken into partnership along

<!-- page 30 col 2 -->

with a young fellow whose
worth at least one hun. thousand.
Firm now&mdash;Livingstone, Harvey, &amp;
Co. Clever punch, that. Little too
much lemon&mdash;d&mdash;d it, the sugar's
out.</p>

<p>"Queer thing, that! Some weeks
ago respectable old gentleman in white
cravat and hump-back, came to counting
house. Old fellow hailed from
Charleston. Had rather a Jewish
twang on his tongue. Presented Livingstone
a letter of credit drawn by a
Charleston house on our firm. Letter
from Grayson, Ballenger, &amp; Co., for
a cool hundred thousand. Old white
cravat got it. D&mdash;n that rat in the
partition&mdash;why can't he eat his
victuals in quiet? Two weeks since,
news came that G. B. &amp; Co. never
gave such letter&mdash;a forgery, a complete
swindle. Comfortable, that. Hot
coals on one's bare skull, quite pleasant
in comparison. Livingstone in
New York&mdash;been trying for a week
to track up the villain. Must get new
pipe to-morrow. Mem. get one with
Judas Iscariot painted on the bowl.
Honest rogue, that. Went and hanged
himself after he sold his master.
Wonder how full the town would be
if all who have sold their God for
gold would hang themselves? Hooks
in market house would rise. Bear
queer fruit&mdash;eh? D&mdash;&mdash;d good tobacco.
By-the-bye&mdash;must go home.
Another sip of the punch and I'm off.
Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;good idea that of the handsome
Colonel! Great buck, man of
fashion and long-haired Apollo. Called
here this evening to see me&mdash;smelt
like a civet cat. Must flourish his
pocket-book before my eyes by way of
a genteel brag. Dropped a letter from

<!-- page 31 col 1 -->

a bundle of notes. Valuable letter that.
Wouldn't part with it for a cool thousand&mdash;rather
think it will raise the
devil&mdash;let me see&mdash;"</p>

<p>And laying down his pipe, Mr. Luke
Harvey drew a neatly-folded billet-doux
from an inside pocket of his
coat, and holding it in the glare of the
light perused its direction, which was
written in a fair and delicate woman's
hand.</p>

<p>" 'Col. Fitz-Cowles&mdash;United States
Hotel' "&mdash;he murmured&mdash;"good idea,
Colonel, to drop <i>such</i> a letter out of
your pocket-book. Won't trouble you
none? S'pose not&mdash;ha, ha, ha&mdash;d&mdash;&mdash;d
good idea!"</p>

<p>The idea appeared to tickle him
immensely, for he chuckled in a deep,
self-satisfied tone as he drew on his
bearskin overcoat, and even while he
extinguished the gas-light, and covered
up the fire, his chuckle grew into a
laugh, which deepened into a hearty
guffaw, as striding through the dark
warehouse, he gained the front door,
and looked out into the deserted street.</p>

<p>"Ha-ha-ha&mdash;to drop such a dear
creature's letter!"&mdash;he laughed, locking
the door of the warehouse&mdash;"Wonder
if it won't raise h&mdash;l? I
loved a woman once. Luke, you were
a d&mdash;&mdash;d fool <i>that</i> time. Jilted&mdash;yes
jilted. That's the word I believe?
Maybe I won't have my revenge?
Perhaps not&mdash;very likely not&mdash;"</p>

<p>With this momentous letter, so
carelessly dropped by the insinuating
millionaire, Colonel Fitz-Cowles resting
on his mind, and stirring his features
with frequent spasmodic attacks
of laughter, our friend, Mr. Harvey,
pursued his way along Front Street,
and turning up Chestnut Street, arrived

<!-- page 31 col 2 -->

at the corner of Third, where he halted
for a few moments in order to
ascertain the difference in time, between
his gold-repeater and the State House
clock, which had just struck one.</p>

<p>While thus engaged, intently perusing
the face of his watch by the light
of the moon, a stout middle-aged gentleman,
wrapped up in a thick overcoat,
with a carpet bag in his hand,
came striding rapidly across the street,
and for a moment stood silent and
unperceived at his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Well Luke&mdash;is the repeater right
and the State House wrong?" said a
hearty cheerful voice, and the middle-aged
gentleman laid his hand on Mr.
Harvey's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Ah-ha! Mr. Livingstone! Is that
you?" cried Luke, suddenly wheeling
round, and gazing into the frank and
manly countenance of the new-comer&mdash;"When
did you get back from New
York?"</p>

<p>"Just this moment arrived. I did
not expect to return within a week
from this time, and therefore come
upon you by a little surprise. I wrote
to Mrs. L. yesterday, telling her I
would not be in town until the Christmas
holidays were over. She'll be
rather surprised to see me, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Rather!" echoed Luke, drily.</p>

<p>"Come Luke, take my arm, and
let's walk up toward my house. I
have much to say to you. In the first
place have you anything new?"</p>

<p>While Mr. Harvey is imparting his
budget of news to the senior partner
of the firm of Livingstone, Harvey &amp;
Co., as they stroll slowly along Chestnut
Street, we will make some few
notes of his present appearance.</p>

<p>Stout, muscular, and large-boned,

<!-- page 32 col 1 -->

with a figure slightly inclining towards
corpulence, Mr. Livingstone strode
along the pavement with a firm and
measured step, that attested all the
matured strength and vigor peculiar
to robust middle age. He was six
feet high, with broad shoulders and
muscular chest. His face was full,
bold, and massive, rather bronzed in
hue, and bearing some slight traces of
the ravages of small-pox. Once or
twice as he walked along, he lifted
his hat from his face, and his forehead,
rendered more conspicuous by
some slight baldness, was exposed to
view. It was high, and wide, and
massive, bulging outward prominently
in the region of the reflective organs,
and faintly relieved by his short brown
hair. His eyes, bold and large, of a
calm clear blue, were rendered strangely
expressive by the contrast of the
jet-black eyebrows. His nose was
firm and Roman in contour, his mouth
marked by full and determined lips,
his chin square and prominent, while
the lengthened outline of the lower
jaw, from the chin to the ear, gave
his countenance an expression of inflexible
resolution. In short, it was
the face of a man, whose mind, great
in resources, had only found room for
the display of its tamest powers, in
enlarged mercantile operations, while
its dark and desperate elements, from
the want of adversity, revenge or hate
to rouse them into action, had lain still
and dormant for some twenty long
years of active life. He never dreamed
himself that he carried a hidden
hell within his soul.</p>

<p>Had this man been born poor, it is
probable that in his attempt to rise,
the grim hand of want would have

<!-- page 32 col 2 -->

dragged from their lurking-places,
these dark and fearful elements of his
being. But wealth had lapped him at
his birth, smiled on him in his youth,
walked by him through life, and the
moment for the trial of all his powers
had never happened. He was a fine
man, a noble merchant, and a good
citizen&mdash;we but repeat the stereotyped
phrases of the town and yet,
quiet and close, near the heart of this
cheerful-faced man, lay a sleeping
devil, who had been dozing away
there all his life, and only waiting the
call of destiny to spring into terrible
action, and rend that manly bosom
with his fangs.</p>

<p>"Have you heard any news of the&mdash;forger?"
asked Luke Harvey, when
he had delivered his budget of news&mdash;"Any
intelligence of the respectable
gentleman in the white cravat and
hump-back?"</p>

<p>"He played the same game in New
York that he played in our city.
Wherever I went, I heard nothing but
'Mr. Ellis Mortimer, of Charleston,
bought goods to a large amount here,
on the strength of a letter of credit,
drawn on your house by Grayson,
Ballenger, &amp; Co.,' or that 'Mr. Mortimer
bought goods to a large amount
in such-and-such a-store, backed by
the same letter of credit&mdash;' No less
than twelve wholesale houses gave
him credit to an almost unlimited extent.
In all cases the goods were
despatched to the various auctions and
sold at half-cost, while Mr. Ellis Mortimer
pocketed the cash&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you have no traces of this
prince of swindlers?"</p>

<p>"None! all the police in New York
have been raising heaven-and-earth to

<!-- page 33 col 1 -->

catch him for this week past, but without
success. At last I have come to
the conclusion that he is lurking about
this city, with the respectable sum of
two hundred thousand dollars in his
possession. I am half-inclined to believe
that he is not alone in this business&mdash;there
may be a combination
of scoundrels concerned in the affair.
To-morrow the police shall ransack
every hiding-hole and cranny in the
city. My friend, Col. Fitz-Cowles
gave me some valuable suggestions
before I left for New York&mdash;I will
ask his advice, in regard to the matter,
the first thing in the morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very fine man, that Col. Fitz-Cowles&mdash;"
observed Luke, as they
turned down Fourth Street&mdash;"Splendid
fellow. Dresses well&mdash;gives
capital terrapin suppers at the United
States&mdash;inoculates all the bucks about
town with his style of hat. Capital
fellow&mdash;Son of an English Earl&mdash;ain't
he, Mr. Livingstone?"</p>

<p>"So I have understood&mdash;" replied
Mr. Livingstone, not exactly liking the
quiet sneer which lurked under the
innocent manner of his partner&mdash;"a
least so it is rumored&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Got lots of money&mdash;a millionaire&mdash;no
end to his wealth. By-the-bye,
where the d&mdash;&mdash;l did he come from?
Isn't he a Southern planter with acres
of niggers and prairies of cotton?"</p>

<p>"Luke, that's a very strange question
to ask me. You just now asked
me, whether he was the son of an
English Earl&mdash;didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Believe I did. To tell the truth,
I've heard both stories about him, and
some dozen more. An heir-apparent
to an English Earldom, a rich planter
from the South, the son of a Boston

<!-- page 33 col 2 -->

<i>magnifique</i>, the only child of a rich
Mexican&mdash;these things you will see,
don't mix well. Who the devil is our
long-haired friend, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Tut-tut&mdash;Luke this is all folly.
You know that Col. Fitz-Cowles is received
in the best society, mingles with
the <i>ton</i> of the Quaker City, is 'squired
about by our judges and lawyers, and
can always find scores of friends to
help him spend his fortune&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fine man, that Col. Fitz-Cowles.
Very," said the other in his dry and
biting tone.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Luke, that I think
the married men the happiest in the
world?" said Livingstone, drawing
the arm of his partner closely within
his own&mdash;"Now look at my case for
instance. A year ago I was a miserable
bachelor. The loss of one hundred
thousand dollars then, would have
driven me frantic. Now I have a
sweet young wife to cheer me, her
smile welcomes me home; the first
tone of her voice, and my loss is forgotten!"</p>

<p>The Merchant paused. His eye
glistened with a tear, and he felt his
heart grow warm in his bosom, as the
vision of his sweet young wife, now
so calmly sleeping on her solitary bed
rose before him. He imagined her
smile of welcome as she beheld him
suddenly appear by her bedside; he
felt her arms so full and round twining
fondly round his neck, and he tried to
fancy&mdash;&mdash;but the attempt was vain&mdash;the
luxury of a kiss from her red ripe
lips.</p>

<p>"You may think me uxorious,
Luke&mdash;" he resumed in his deep
manly voice&mdash;"But I do think that
God never made a nobler woman than

<!-- page 34 col 1 -->

my Dora! Look at the sacrifice she
made for my sake? Young, blooming,
and but twenty summers old, she
forgot the disparity of my years, and
consented to share my bachelor's-home&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She <i>is</i> a noble woman&mdash;" observed
Luke, and then he looked at
the moon and whistled an air from
the very select operatic spectacle of
'Bone Squash.' "</p>

<p>"Noble in heart and soul!" exclaimed
Livingstone&mdash;"confess, Luke
that we married men live more in an
hour than you dull bachelors in a
year&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;yes&mdash;certainly! You may
well talk when you have such a handsome
wife! Egad&mdash;if I wasn't afraid
it would make you jealous&mdash;I would
say that Mrs. Livingstone has the
most splendid form I ever beheld&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a slight contortion of Mr.
Harvey's upper lip as he spoke, which
looked very much like a sneer.</p>

<p>"And then her heart, Luke, her
heart! So noble, so good, so affectionate!
I wish you could have seen
her, where first I beheld her&mdash;in a
small and meanly furnished apartment,
at the bedside of a dying
mother! They were in reduced circumstances,
for her father had died
insolvent. He had been my father's
friend, and I thought it my duty to
visit the widowed mother and the
orphan daughter. By-the-bye, Luke,
I now remember that I saw you at
their house in Wood Street once&mdash;did
you know the family?"</p>

<p>"Miss Dora's father had been kind
to me&mdash;" said Luke in a quiet tone.
There was a strange light in his dark

<!-- page 34 col 2 -->

eye as he spoke, and a remarkable
tremor on his lip.</p>

<p>"Well, well, Luke&mdash;here's my
house&mdash;exclaimed Mr. Livingstone,
as they arrived in front of a lofty four
storied mansion, situated in the aristocratic
square, as it is called, along
south Fourth Street. "It is lucky I
have my dead-latch key. I can enter
without disturbing the servants. Come
up stairs, into the front parlor with
me, Luke; I want to have a few more
words with you about the forgery&mdash;"</p>

<p>They entered the door of the mansion,
passed along a wide and roomy
entry, ascended a richly carpeted
staircase, and, traversing the entry in
the second story, in a moment stood
in the centre of the spacious parlor,
fronting the street on the second floor.
In another moment, Mr. Livingstone,
by the aid of some Lucifer matches
which he found on the mantle, lighted
a small bed-lamp, standing amid the
glittering volumes that were piled on
the centre table. The dim light of the
lamp flickering around the room, revealed
the various characteristics of
an apartment furnished in a style of
lavish magnificence. Above the mantle
flashed an enormous mirror, on
one side of the parlor was an inviting
sofa, on the other a piano; two splendid
ottomans stood in front of the fireless
hearth, and, curtains of splendid
silk hung drooping heavily along the
three lofty windows that looked into
the street. In fine, the parlor was all
that the upholsterer and cabinet
maker combined could make it, a depository
of luxurious appointments and
costly furniture.</p>

<p>"Draw your seat near the centre

<!-- page 35 col 1 -->

table, Luke&mdash;" cried Mr. Livingstone,
as he flung himself into a comfortable
rocking chair, and gazed around the
room with an expression of quiet satisfaction&mdash;"Don't
speak too loud, Luke,
for Dora is sleeping in the next room.
You know I want to take her by a
little surprise&mdash;eh, Luke? She
doesn't expect me from New York
for a week yet&mdash;I am the last person
in the world she thinks to see to-night.
Clearly so&mdash;ha&mdash;ha!"</p>

<p>And the merchant chuckled gaily,
rubbed his hands together, glanced at
the folding doors that opened into the
bedchamber, where slept his blooming
wife, and then turning round, looked
in the face of Luke Harvey with a
smile, that seemed to say&mdash;"I can't
help it if you bachelors are miserable&mdash;pity
you, but can't help it."</p>

<p>"It <i>would</i> be a pity to awaken Mrs.
Livingstone&mdash;" said Luke fixing his
brilliant dark eye on the face of the
senior partner, with a look so meaning
and yet mysterious, that Mr. Livingstone
involuntarily averted his gaze&mdash;"A
very great pity. By-the-bye,
with regard to the forgery&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me recapitulate the facts.
Some weeks ago we received a letter
from the respectable house of Grayson,
Ballenger, &amp; Co., Charleston, stating
that they had made a large purchase
in cotton from a rich planter&mdash;Mr.
Ellis Mortimer, who, in a week or so,
would visit Philadelphia, with a letter
of credit on our house for one hundred
thousand dollars. They gave us this
intimation in order that we might be
prepared to cash the letter of credit at
sight. Well, in a week a gentleman
of respectable exterior appeared, stated
that he was Mr. Ellis Mortimer, presented

<!-- page 35 col 2 -->

his letter of credit; it was cashed
and we wrote to Grayson, Ballenger,
&amp; Co., announcing the fact&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They returned the agreeable answer
that Mr. Ellis Mortimer had not
yet left Charleston for Philadelphia,
but had altered his intention and was
about to sail for London. That the
gentleman in the white cravat and
hump-back was an impostor, and the
letter of credit a&mdash;forgery. There
was considerable mystery in the affair;
for instance, how did the impostor
gain all the necessary information
with regard to Mr. Mortimer's visit,
how did he acquire a knowledge of the
signature of the Charleston house?"</p>

<p>"Listen and I will tell you. Last
week, in New York, I received a letter
from the Charleston house announcing
these additional facts. It
appears that in the beginning of fall
they received a letter from a Mr. Albert
Hazelton Munroe, representing
himself as a rich planter in Wainbridge,
South Carolina. He had a
large amount of cotton to sell, and
would like to procure advances on it
from the Charleston house. They
wrote him an answer to his letter, asking
the quality of the cotton, and so
forth, and soliciting an interview with
Mr. Munroe when he visited Charleston.
In the beginning of November
Mr. Munroe, a dark-complexioned
man, dressed like a careless country
squire, entered their store for the first
time, and commenced a series of negotiations
about his cotton, which
had resulted in nothing, when another
planter, Mr. Ellis Mortimer, appeared
in the scene, sold his cotton, and requested
the letter of credit on our
house. Mr. Munroe was in the store

<!-- page 36 col 1 -->

every day&mdash;was a jolly unpretending
fellow&mdash;familiar with all the
clerks and on intimate terms with
Messrs. Grayson, Ballenger, &amp; Co.
The letter written to our house, intimating
the intended visit of Mr. Mortimer
to this city, had been very carelessly
left open for a few moments on
the counting house desk, and Mr.
Munroe was observed glancing over
its contents by one of the clerks. The
day after that letter had been despatched
to Philadelphia, Mr. Albert H.
Munroe suddenly disappeared, and
had not been heard of since. The
Charleston house suspect him of the
whole forgery in all its details&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very likely. He saw the letter
on the counter&mdash;forged the letter of
credit and despatched his accomplice
to Philadelphia without delay&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now for the consequences of this
forgery. On Monday morning next
we have an engagement of one hundred
thousand dollars to meet, which,
under present circumstances, may
plunge our house into the vortex of
bankruptcy. Unless this impostor is
discovered, unless his connection with
this Munroe is clearly ascertained before
next Monday, I must look forward
to that day as one of the greatest
danger to our house. You see our position,
Luke?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;" answered Luke, as
he arose, and, advancing, gazed fixedly
into the face of Mr. Livingstone&mdash;"I
see <i>our</i> position, and I see <i>your</i>
position in more respects than one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Confound the thing, man, how
you stare in my face. Do you see
anything peculiar about my countenance,
that you peruse it so attentively?"</p>

<!-- page 36 col 2 -->

<p>"Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;" cried Luke, with a
hysterical laugh&mdash;"Ha&mdash;ha! Nothing
but&mdash;horns. Horns, sir, I
say&mdash;horns. A fine branching pair!
Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;Why damn it, Livingstone,
you won't be able to enter the
church door, next Sunday, without
stooping&mdash;<i>those</i> horns are so d&mdash;d
large!"</p>

<p>Livingstone looked at him with a
face of blank wonder. He evidently
supposed that Luke had been seized
with sudden madness. To see a man
who is your familiar friend and partner,
abruptly break off a conversation
on matters of the most importance,
and stare vacantly in your face as he
compliments you on some fancied resemblance
which you bear to a full-grown
stag, is, it must be confessed,
a spectacle somewhat unfrequent in
this world of ours, and rather adapted
to excite a feeling of astonishment
whenever it happens.</p>

<p>"Mr. Harvey&mdash;are&mdash;you&mdash;mad?"
asked Livingstone, in a calm deliberate
tone.</p>

<p>Harvey slowly leaned forward and
brought his face so near Livingstone's
that the latter could feel his breath on
his cheek. He applied his mouth to
the ear of the senior partner, and
whispered a single word.</p>

<p>When a soldier, in battle, receives
a bullet directly in the heart, he springs
in the air with one convulsive spasm,
flings his arms aloft and utters a
groan that thrills the man who hears
it with a horror never to be forgotten.
With that same convulsive movement,
with that same deep groan of horror
and anguish Livingstone, the merchant,
sprang to his feet, and confronted
the utterer of that single word.</p>

<!-- page 37 col 1 -->

<p>"Harvey&mdash;" he said, in a low tone,
and with white and trembling lips,
while his calm blue eye flashed with
that deep glance of excitement, most
terrible when visible in a calm blue
eye&mdash;"Harvey, you had better never
been born, than utter that word again.
To trifle with a thing of this kind is
worse than death. Harvey, I advise
you to leave me&mdash;I am losing all
command of myself&mdash;there is a voice
within me tempting me to murder you&mdash;for
God's sake quit my sight&mdash;"</p>

<p>Harvey looked in his face, fearless
and undaunted, though his snake-like
eye blazed like a coal of fire, and his
thin lips quivered as with the death
spasm.</p>

<p>"<i>Cuckold!</i>" he shrieked in a hissing
voice, with a wild hysterical laugh.</p>

<p>Livingstone started back aghast.
The purple veins stood out like cords
on his bronzed forehead, and his right
hand trembled like a leaf as it was
thrust within the breast of his coat.
His blue eye&mdash;great God! how glassy
it had grown&mdash;was fixed upon the
form of Luke Harvey as if meditating
where to strike.</p>

<p>"To the bedchamber&mdash;" shrieked
Luke. "If <i>she</i> is there, I am a liar
and a dog, and deserve to die. <i>Cuckold</i>,
I say, and will prove it&mdash;to the
bedchamber!"</p>

<p>And to the bedchamber with an even
stride, though his massive form quivered
like an oak shaken by the hurricane,
strode the merchant. The folding
door slid back&mdash;he had disappeared
into the bedchamber.</p>

<p>There was silence for a single instant,
like the silence in the graveyard,
between the last word of the prayer,

<!-- page 37 col 2 -->

and the first rattling sound of the clods
upon the coffin.</p>

<p>In a moment Livingstone again
strode into the parlor. His face was
the hue of ashes. You could see that
the struggle at work within his heart
was like the agony of the strong man
wrestling with death. <i>This</i> struggle
was tenfold more terrible than death&mdash;death
in its vilest form. It forced the
big beaded drops of sweat out from
the corded veins on his brow, it drove
the blood from his face, leaving a
black and discolored streak beneath
each eye.</p>

<p>"She is not there&mdash;" he said,
taking Luke by the hand, which he
wrung with an iron grasp, and murmured
again&mdash;"She is not there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"False to her husband's bed and
honor&mdash;" exclaimed Luke, the agitation
which had convulsed his face,
subsiding into a look of heart-wrung
compassion, as he looked upon the
terrible results of his disclosure&mdash;"False
as hell, and vile as false!"</p>

<p>An object on the centre table, half
concealed by the bed-lamp arrested
the husband's attention. He thrust
aside the lamp and beheld a note, addressed
to himself, in Mrs. Livingstone's
hand.</p>

<p>With a trembling hand the merchant
tore the note open, and while Luke
stood fixedly regarding him, perused
its contents.</p>

<p>And as he read, the blood came
back to his cheeks, the glance to his
eyes, and his brow reddened over with
one burning flush of indignation.</p>

<p>"Liar and dog!" he shouted, in
tones hoarse with rage, as he grasped
Luke Harvey by the throat with a

<!-- page 38 col 1 -->

sudden movement&mdash;"Your lie was
well coined, but look here! Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;"
and he shook Luke to and fro like
a broken reed&mdash;"Here is my wife's
letter. Here, sir, look at it, and I'll
force you to eat your own foul words.
Here, expecting that I might suddenly
return from New York, my wife has
written down that she would be absent
from home to-night. A sick friend,
a school-day companion, now reduced
to widowhood and penury, solicited
her company by her dying bed, and
my wife could not refuse. Read, sir&mdash;oh
read!"</p>

<p>"Take your hand from my throat
or I'll do you a mischief&mdash;"murmured
Luke, in a choking voice as
he grew black in the face. "I will,
by God&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Read&mdash;sir&mdash;oh read!" shouted
Livingstone, as he forced Luke into a
chair and thrust the letter into his
hands&mdash;"Read, sir, and then crawl
from this room like a vile dog as you
are. To-morrow I will settle with
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Luke sank in the chair, took the
letter, and with a pale face, varied by
a crimson spot on each cheek, he began
to read, while Livingstone, towering
and erect, stood regarding him
with a look of incarnate scorn.</p>

<p>It was observable that while Luke
perused the letter, his head dropped
slowly down as though in the endeavor
to see more clearly, and his unoccupied
hand was suddenly thrust
within the breast of his overcoat.</p>

<p>"That is a very good letter. Well
written, and she minds her stops&mdash;"
exclaimed Luke calmly, as he handed
the letter back to Mr. Livingstone&mdash;"Quite
an effort of composition. I

<!-- page 38 col 2 -->

didn't think Dora had so much
tact&mdash;"</p>

<p>The merchant was thunderstruck
with the composure exhibited by the
slanderer and the liar. He glanced
over Luke's features with a quick
nervous glance, and then looked at
the letter which he held in his hand.</p>

<p>"Ha! This is not the same letter!"
he shouted, in tones of mingled rage
and wonder&mdash;"This letter is addressed
to 'Col. Fitz-Cowles'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was dropped in the counting
house by the Colonel this evening&mdash;"
said Luke, with the air of a man who
was prepared for any hazard&mdash;"The
Colonel is a very fine man. A favorite
with the fair sex. Read it&mdash;<i>Oh</i>
read&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a look of wonder Mr. Livingstone
opened the letter. There was a
quivering start in his whole frame,
when he first observed the hand-writing.</p>

<p>But as he went on, drinking in word
after word, his countenance, so full of
meaning and expression, was like a
mirror, in which different faces are
seen, one after another, by sudden
transition. At first his face grew crimson,
then it was pale as death in an
instant. Then his lips dropped apart,
and his eyes were covered with a
glassy film. Then a deep wrinkle
shot upward between his brows, and
then, black and ghastly, the circles of
discolored flesh were visible beneath
each eye. The quivering nostrils&mdash;the
trembling hands&mdash;the heaving
chest&mdash;did man ever die with a struggle
terrible as this?</p>

<p>He sank heavily into a chair, and
crushing the letter between his fingers,
buried his face in his hands.</p>

<!-- page 39 col 1 -->

<p>"Oh my God&mdash;" he groaned&mdash;"Oh
my God&mdash;and I loved her so!"</p>

<p>And then between the very fingers
convulsively clutching the fatal letter,
there fell large and scalding tears,
drop by drop, pouring heavily, like
the first tokens of a coming thunderbolt,
on a summer day.</p>

<p>Luke Harvey arose, and strode hurriedly
along the floor. The sight was
too much for him to bear. And yet
as he turned away he heard the groans
of the strong man in his agony, and
the heart-wrung words came, like
the voice of the dying, to his ear&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh my God, oh my God, and I
loved her so!"</p>

<p>When Luke again turned and gazed
upon the betrayed husband, he beheld
a sight that filled him with unutterable
horror.</p>

<p>There, as he sat, his face buried in
his hands, his head bowed on his
breast, his brow was partly exposed
to the glare of the lamp-beams, and
all around that brow, amid the locks
of his dark brown hair, were streaks
of hoary white. The hair of the merchant
had withered at the root. The
blow was so sudden, so blighting, and
so terrible, that even his strong mind
reeled, his brain tottered, and in the
effort to command his reason, his hair
grew white with agony.*</p>

<p class="small">[*This is a fact, established by the evidence
of a medical gentleman of the first reputation.]</p>

<p>"Would to God I had not told
him&mdash;" murmured Luke&mdash;"I knew
not that he loved her so&mdash;I knew not&mdash;and
yet&mdash;ha, ha, <i>I</i> loved her
once&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Luke&mdash;my friend&mdash;" said Livingstone
in a tremulous voice as he

<!-- page 39 col 2 -->

raised his face&mdash;"Know you anything
of <i>the place</i>&mdash;named in&mdash;the letter?"</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;and will lead you there&mdash;"
answered Luke, his face resuming its
original expression of agitation&mdash;"Come!"
he cried, in a husky voice,
as olden-time memories seemed striving
at his heart&mdash;"Come!"</p>

<p>"Can you gain me access to the
house&mdash;to <i>the&mdash;the</i> room?"</p>

<p>"Did I not track them thither last
night? <i>Come!</i>"</p>

<p>The merchant slowly rose and took
a pair of pistols from his carpet bag.
They were small and convenient
travelling pistols, mounted in silver,
with those noiseless 'patent' triggers
that emit no clicking sound by way
of warning. He inspected the percussion
caps, and sounded each pistol
barrel.</p>

<p>"Silent and sure&mdash;" muttered
Luke&mdash;"They are each loaded with
a single ball."</p>

<p>"Which way do you lead? To
the southern part of the city?"</p>

<p>"To Southwark&mdash;" answered
Luke, leading the way from the parlor&mdash;"To
the rookery, to the den, to
the pest-house&mdash;"</p>

<p>In a moment they stood upon the
door-step of the merchant's princely
mansion, the vivid light of the December
moon, imparting a ghastly hue to
Livingstone's face, with the glassy
eyes, rendered more fearful by the discolored
circles of flesh beneath, the
furrowed brow, and the white lips, all
fixed in an expression stern and resolute
as death.</p>

<p>Luke flung his hand to the south,
and his dark impenetrable eyes shone
with meaning. The merchant placed

<!-- page 40 col 1 -->

his partner's arm within his own, and
they hurried down Fourth Street with
a single word from Luke&mdash;</p>

<p>"To Monk-Hall!"</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br/>

<p>CHAPTER SIXTH.</p>

<p class="small">MONK-HALL.*</p>

</div>

<p class="small">[*<i>No reader who wishes to understand this
story in all its details will fail to peruse this
chapter.</i>]</p>

<p>STRANGE traditions have come
down to our time, in relation to a
massive edifice, which, long before
the Revolution, stood in the centre of
an extensive garden, surrounded by a
brick wall, and encircled by a deep
grove of horse-chestnut and beechen
trees. This edifice was located on the
out-skirts of the southern part of the
city, and the garden overspread some
acres, occupying a space full as large
as a modern square.</p>

<p>This mansion, but rarely seen by
intrusive eyes, had been originally
erected by a wealthy foreigner, sometime
previous to the Revolution. Who
this foreigner was, his name or his
history, has not been recorded by tradition;
but his mansion, in its general
construction and details, indicated a
mind rendered whimsical and capricious
by excessive wealth.</p>

<p>The front of the mansion, one plain
mass of black and red brick, disposed
like the alternate colors of a chess-board,
looked towards the south. A
massive hall-door, defended by heavy
pillars, and surmounted by an intricate
cornice, all carved and sculptured into
hideous satyr-faces; three ranges of

<!-- page 40 col 2 -->

deep square windows, with cumbrous
sash frames and small panes of glass;
a deep and sloping roof, elaborate
with ornaments of painted wood along
the eaves, and rising into a gabled
peak directly over the hall-door, while
its outlines were varied by rows of
substantial chimneys, fashioned into
strange and uncouth shapes,&mdash;all
combined, produced a general impression
of ease and grandeur that was
highly effective in awing the spirits of
any of the simple citizens who might
obtain a casual glance of the house
through the long avenue of trees extending
from the garden gate.</p>

<p>This impression of awe was somewhat
deepened by various rumors that
obtained through the southern part of
the Quaker City. It was said that
the wealthy proprietor, not satisfied
with building a fine house with three
stories above ground, had also constructed
three stories of spacious
chambers below the level of the
earth. This was calculated to stir
the curiosity and perhaps the scandal
of the town, and as a matter of course
strange rumors began to prevail about
midnight orgies held by the godless
proprietor in his subterranean apartments,
where wine was drunken without
stint, and beauty ruined without
remorse. Veiled figures had been
seen passing through the garden gate
after night, and men were not wanting
to swear that these figures, in dark
robes and sweeping veils, were pretty
damsels with neat ankles and soft
eyes.</p>

<p>As time passed on, the rumors
grew and the mystery deepened.
The neatly-constructed stable at the
end of the garden was said to be connected

<!-- page 41 col 1 -->

with the house, some hundred
yards distant, by a subterranean passage.
The two wings, branching out
at either extremity of the rear of the
mansion, looked down upon a court-yard,
separated by a light wicket
fence from the garden walks. The
court-yard, overarched by an awning
in summer time, was said to be the
scene of splendid festivals to which
the grandees of the city were invited.
From the western wing of the mansion
arose a square lanthern-like
structure, which the gossips called a
tower, and hinted sagely of witchcraft
and devildom whenever it was named.
They called the proprietor, a libertine,
a gourmand, an astrologer and a
wizard. He feasted in the day and he
consulted his friend, the Devil, at
night. He drank wine at all times,
and betrayed innocence on every occasion.
In short the seclusion of the
mansion, its singular structure, its
wall of brick and its grove of impenetrable
trees, gave rise to all sorts of
stories, and the proprietor has come
down to our time with a decidedly bad
character, although it is more than
likely that he was nothing but a
wealthy Englishman, whimsical and
eccentric, the boon-companion and
friend of Governor Evans, the rollicking
Chief Magistrate of the Province.</p>

<p>Although tradition has not preserved
the name of the mysterious individual
yet the title of his singular mansion,
is still on record.</p>

<p>It was called&mdash;Monk-Hall.</p>

<p>There are conflicting traditions
which assert that this title owed its
origin to other sources. A Catholic
Priest occupied the mansion after the
original proprietor went home to his

<!-- page 41 col 2 -->

native land, or slid into his grave; it
was occupied as a Nunnery, as a
Monastery, or as a resort for the Sisters
of Charity; the mass had been said
within its walls, its subterranean
chambers converted into cells, its
tower transformed into an oratory of
prayer&mdash;such are the dim legends
which were rife some forty years ago,
concerning Monk-Hall, long after the
city, in its southern march, had cut
down the trees, overturned the wall,
levelled the garden into building lots
and divided it by streets and alleys
into a dozen triangles and squares.</p>

<p>Some of these legends, so vague
and so conflicting, are still preserved
in the memories of aged men and
white-haired matrons, who will sit by
the hour and describe the gradual
change which time and improvement,
those twin desolators of the beautiful,
had accomplished with Monk-Hall.</p>

<p>Soon after the Revolution, fine brick
buildings began to spring up along the
streets which surrounded the garden,
while the alleys traversing its area,
grew lively with long lines of frame
houses, variously fashioned and painted,
whose denizens awoke the echoes
of the place with the sound of the
hammer and the grating of the saw.
Time passed on, and the distinctive
features of the old mansion and garden
were utterly changed. Could the old
proprietor have risen from his grave,
and desired to pay another visit to his
friend, the Devil, in the subterranean
chambers of his former home, he
would have had, to say the least of it, a
devil of a time in finding the way.
Where the old brick wall had stood
he would have found long rows of
dwelling houses, some four storied,

<!-- page 42 col 1 -->

some three or one, some brick,
some frame, a few pebble-dashed, and
all alive with inhabitants.</p>

<p>In his attempt to find the Hall, he
would have had to wind up a narrow
alley, turn down a court, strike up an
avenue, which it would take some
knowledge of municipal geography to
navigate. At last, emerging into a narrow
street where four alleys crossed,
he would behold his magnificent mansion
of Monk-Hall with a printing
office on one side and a stereotype
foundry on the other, while on the
opposite side of the way, a mass of
miserable frame houses seemed about
to commit suicide and fling themselves
madly into the gutter, and in the distance
a long line of dwellings, offices,
and factories, looming in broken perspective,
looked as if they wanted to
shake hands across the narrow street.
The southern front of the house&mdash;alas,
how changed&mdash;alone is visible. The
shutters on one side of the hall-door are
nailed up and hermetically closed,
while, on the other, shutters within the
glasses bar out the light of day. The
semi-circular window in the centre
of the gabled peak has been built up
with brick, yet our good friend would
find the tower on the western wing in
tolerable good preservation. The stable
one hundred yards distant from
Monk-Hall&mdash;what has become of it?
Perhaps it is pulled down, or it may
be that a splendid dwelling towers in
its place? It is still in existence,
standing amid the edifices of a busy
street, its walls old and tottering, its
ancient stable-floor turned into a bulk
window, surmounted by the golden
balls of a Pawnbroker, while within its
precincts, rooms furnished for household

<!-- page 42 col 2 -->

use supply the place of the stalls
of the olden-time. Does the subterranean
passage still exist? Future
pages of our story may possibly answer
the question.</p>

<p>Could our ancient and ghostly proprietor,
glide into the tenements adjoining
Monk-Hall, and ask the mechanic
or his wife, the printer or the
factory man to tell him the story of
the strange old building, he would find
that the most remarkable ignorance
prevailed in regard to the structure,
its origin and history. One man
might tell him that it had been a factory,
or a convent, or the Lord knows
what, another might intimate that it
had been a church, a third (and he
belonged to the most numerous class)
would reply in a surly tone that he
knew nothing about the old brick nuisance,
while in the breasts of one or
two aged men and matrons, yet living
in Southwark, would be discovered the
only chronicles of the ancient structure
now extant, the only records of
its history or name. Did our spirit-friend
glide over the threshold and
enter the chambers of his home, his
eye would, perhaps, behold scenes that
rivalled, in vice and magnificence,
anything that legend chronicled of the
olden-time of Monk-Hall, although its
exterior was so desolate, and its outside-door
of green blinds varied by a
big brass plate, bore the respectable
and saintly name of "ABIJAH K.
JONES," in immense letters, half indistinct
with dirt and rust.</p>

<p>Who this Abijah K. Jones was, no
one knew, although the owner of the
house, a good Christian, who had a
pew in &mdash;&mdash; church, where he took
the sacrament at least once a month,

<!-- page 43 col 1 -->

might have been able to tell with very
little research. Yet what of that?
Abijah K. Jones might have nightly
entertained the infernal regions in his
house, and not a word been said about
it; because, as the pious landlord
would observe, when cramming Abijah's
rent-money into the same pocket-book
that contained some tract-society
receipts,&mdash;"Good tenant that!&mdash;pays
his rent with the regularity of clock-work!"</p>

<p>CHAPTER SEVENTH.</p>

<p class="small">THE MONKS OF MONK-HALL.</p>

</div>

<p>THE moon was shining brightly
over the face of the old mansion, while
the opposite side of the alley lay in
dim and heavy shadow. The light
brown hue of the closed shutters afforded
a vivid contrast to the surface
of the front, which had the strikingly
gloomy effect always produced by the
intermixture of black and red brick,
disposed like the colors of a chess-board,
in the structure of a mansion.
The massive cornice above the hall-door,
the heavy eaves of the roof, the
gabled peak rising in the centre, and
the cumbrous frames of the many
windows,&mdash;all stood out boldly in
the moonlight, from the dismal relief
of the building's front.</p>

<p>The numerous chimneys with their
fantastic shapes rose grimly in the
moonlight, like a strange band of goblin
sentinels, perched on the roof to
watch the mansion. The general effect
was that of an ancient structure
falling to decay, deserted by all inhabitants
save the rats that gnawed the

<!-- page 43 col 2 -->

wainscot along the thick old walls.
The door-plate that glittered on the
faded door, half covered as it was with
rust and verdigris, with its saintly name
afforded the only signs of the actual
occupation of Monk-Hall by human
beings: in all other respects it looked
so desolate, so time-worn, so like a
mausoleum for old furniture, and
crumbling tapestry, for high-backed
mahogany chairs, gigantic bedsteads,
and strange looking mirrors, veiled in
the thick folds of the spider's web.</p>

<p>Dim and indistinct, like the booming
of a distant cannon, the sound of the
State House bell, thrilled along the
intricate maze of streets and alleys.
It struck the hour of two. The murmur
of the last stroke of the bell, so
dim and indistinct, was mingled with
the echo of approaching footsteps, and
in a moment two figures turned the
corner of an alley that wound among
the tangled labyrinth of avenues, and
came hastening on toward the lonely
mansion; lonely even amid tenements
and houses, gathered as thickly together
as the cells in a bee-hive.</p>

<p>"I say, Gus, what a devil of a way
you've led me!" cried one of the
strangers, with a thick cloak wrapped
round his limbs&mdash;"up one alley and
down another, around one street and
through another, backwards and forwards,
round this way and round that&mdash;damme
if I can tell which is north
or south except by the moon!"</p>

<p>"Hist! my fellow&mdash;don't mention
names&mdash;cardinal doctrine that on an
affair of this kind&mdash;" answered the
tall figure, whose towering form was
enveloped in a frogged overcoat&mdash;"Remember,
you pass in as <i>my friend</i>.

<!-- page 44 col 1 -->

Wait a moment&mdash;we'll see whether
old Devil-Bug is awake."</p>

<p>Ascending the granite steps of the
mansion, he gave three distinct raps
with his gold-headed cane, on the surface
of the brass-plate. In a moment
the rattling of a heavy chain, and the
sound of a bolt, slowly withdrawn,
was heard within, and the door of the
mansion, beyond the outside door of
green blinds, receded about the width
of an inch.</p>

<p>"Who's there, a disturbin' honest
folks this hour o' the night&mdash;" said a
voice, that came grumbling through
the blinds of the green door, like the
sound of a grindstone that hasn't been
oiled for some years "What the devil
you want? Go about your business&mdash;or
I'll call the watch&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I say, Devil-Bug, what hour o' th'
night is it?" exclaimed Lorrimer in a
whispered tone.</p>

<p>" 'Dinner time'&mdash;" replied the
grindstone voice slightly oiled&mdash;"Come
in sir. Didn't know 'twas
you. How the devil should I? Come
in&mdash;"</p>

<p>As the voice grunted this invitation,
Lorrimer seized Byrnewood by the
arm, and glided through the opened
door.</p>

<p>Byrnewood looked around in wonder,
as he discovered that the front door
opened into a small closet or room
some ten feet square, the floor bare
and uncarpeted, the ceiling darkened
by smoke, while a large coal fire,
burning in a rusty grate, afforded
both light and heat to the apartment.</p>

<p>The heat was close and stifling,
while the light, but dim and flickering,
disclosed the form of the doorkeeper
of Monk-Hall, as he stood directly in

<!-- page 44 col 2 -->

front of the grate, surrounded by the
details of his den.</p>

<p>"This is <i>my friend</i>&mdash;" said Lorrimer
in a meaning tone&mdash;"You understand,
Devil-Bug?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;" grunted the grindstone
voice&mdash;"I understand. O'course. But
my name is 'Bijah K. Jones, <i>if</i> you
please, my pertikler friend. I never
know'd sich a individooal as Devil-Bug&mdash;"</p>

<p>It requires no great stretch of fancy
to imagine that his Satanic majesty,
once on a time, in a merry mood,
created a huge insect, in order to test
his inventive powers. Certainly that
insect&mdash;which it was quite natural to
designate by the name of Devil-Bug&mdash;stood
in the full light of the grate,
gazing steadfastly in Byrnewood's
face. It was a strange thickset specimen
of flesh and blood, with a short
body, marked by immensely broad
shoulders, long arms and thin distorted
legs. The head of the creature
was ludicrously large in proportion to
the body. Long masses of stiff black
hair fell tangled and matted over a
forehead, protuberant to deformity. A
flat nose with wide nostrils shooting
out into each cheek like the smaller
wings of an insect, an immense mouth
whose heavy lips disclosed two long
rows of bristling teeth, a pointed chin,
blackened by a heavy beard, and massive
eyebrows meeting over the nose,
all furnished the details of a countenance,
not exactly calculated to inspire
the most pleasant feelings in the
world. One eye, small black and
shapen like a bead, stared steadily in
Byrnewood's face, while the other
socket was empty, shrivelled and orbless.
The eyelids of the vacant socket

<!-- page 45 col 1 -->

were joined together like the opposing
edges of a curtain, while the other eye
gained additional brilliancy and effect
from the loss of its fellow member.</p>

<p>The shoulders of the Devil-Bug,
protruding in unsightly knobs, the
wide chest, and the long arms with
talon-like fingers, so vividly contrasted
with the thin and distorted legs, all
attested that the remarkable strength
of the man was located in the upper
part of his body.</p>

<p>"Well, Abijah, are you satisfied?"
asked Lorrimer, as he perceived
Byrnewood shrink back with disgust
from the doorkeeper's gaze&mdash;"<i>This</i>
gentleman, I say, is <i>my</i> friend?"</p>

<p>"So I s'pose," grunted Abijah&mdash;"Here,
Musquito, mark this man&mdash;here.
Glow-worm, mark him, I say.
This is Monk Gusty's friend. Can't
you move quicker, you ugly devils?"</p>

<p>From either side of the fire-place,
as he spoke, emerged a tall Herculean
negro, with a form of strength and
sinews of iron. Moving slowly along
the floor, from the darkness which
had enshrouded their massive outlines,
they stood silent and motionless gazing
with look of stolid indifference
upon the face of the new-comer.
Byrnewood had started aside in disgust
from the Devil-Bug, as he was styled
in the slang of Monk-Hall, but certainly
these additional insects, nestling in the
den of the other, were rather singular
specimens of the glow-worm and musquito.
Their attire was plain and
simple. Each negro was dressed in
coarse corduroy trowsers, and a flaring
red flannel shirt. The face of
Glow-worm was marked by a hideous
flat nose, a receding forehead, and a
wide mouth with immense lips that

<!-- page 45 col 2 -->

buried all traces of a chin and disclosed
two rows of teeth protruding like
the tusks of a wild boar. Musquito
had the same flat nose, the same receding
forehead, but his thick lips,
tightly compressed, were drawn down
on either side towards his jaw, presenting
an outline something like the two
sides of a triangle, while his sharp
and pointed chin was in direct contrast
to the long chinless jaw of the other.
Their eyes, large, rolling and vacant,
stared from bulging eyelids, that protruded
beyond the outline of the brows.
Altogether, each negro presented as
hideous a picture of mere brute
strength, linked with a form scarcely
human, as the imagination of man
might well conceive.</p>

<p>"This is Monk Gusty's friend&mdash;"
muttered Abijah, or Devil-Bug, as the
reader likes&mdash;"Mark him, Musquito&mdash;Mark
him, Glow-worm, I say.
Mind ye now&mdash;this man don't leave
the house except with Gusty? D'ye
hear, ye black devils?"</p>

<p>Each negro growled assent.</p>

<p>"Queer specimens of a Musquito
and a Glow-worm, I say&mdash;" laughed
Byrnewood in the effort to smother his
disgust&mdash;"Eh? Lorrimer?"</p>

<p>"This way, my fellow&mdash;" answered
the magnificent Gus, gently leading
his friend through a small door, which
led from the doorkeeper's closet&mdash;"This
way. Now for the club&mdash;and
then for the wager!"</p>

<p>Looking around in wonder, Byrnewood
discovered that they had passed
into the hall of an old-time mansion,
with the beams of the moon, falling
from a skylight in the roof far above,
down over the windings of a massive
staircase.</p>

<!-- page 46 col 1 -->

<p>"This is rather a strange place&mdash;eh?
Gus?" whispered Byrnewood, as
he gazed around the hall, and marked
the ancient look of the place&mdash;"why
the d&mdash;l don't <i>they</i> have a light&mdash;those
<i>insects</i>&mdash;ha-ha&mdash;whom we have
just left?"</p>

<p>"Secrecy&mdash;my fellow&mdash;secrecy!
Those are the 'police' of Monk-Hall,
certain to be at hand in case of a row.
You see, the entire arrangements of
this place may be explained in one
word&mdash;it is easy enough for a stranger&mdash;that's
you, my boy&mdash;to find his
way <i>in</i>, but it would puzzle him like
the devil to find his way <i>out</i>. That
is, without assistance. Take my arm
Byrnewood&mdash;we must descend to the
club-room&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Descend?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes my fellow. <i>Descend</i>, for we
hold our meetings one story underground.
It's likely all the fellows&mdash;or
Monks, to speak in the slang of the
club&mdash;are now most royally drunk,
so I can slide you in among them,
without much notice. You can remain
there while I go and prepare the
bride&mdash;ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha! the <i>bride</i> for
your visit&mdash;"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, grasping Byrnewood by
the arm, he had led the way along the
hall, beyond the staircase, into the
thick darkness, which rested upon this
part of the place, unillumined by a ray
of light.</p>

<p>"Hold my arm, as tight as you
can&mdash;" he whispered&mdash;"There is a
staircase somewhere here. Softly&mdash;softly&mdash;now
I have it. Tread with
care, Byrnewood&mdash;In a moment we
will be in the midst of the Monks of
Monk-Hall&mdash;"</p>

<p>And as they descended the subterranean

<!-- page 46 col 2 -->

stairway, surrounded by the
darkness of midnight, Byrnewood
found it difficult to subdue a feeling of
awe which began to spread like a
shadow over his soul. This feeling it
was not easy to analyze. It may
have been a combination of feelings;
the consideration of the darkness and
loneliness of the place, his almost
entire ignorance of the handsome libertine
who was now leading him he
knew not where; or perhaps the
earnest words of the Astrologer, fraught
with doom and death, came home to
his soul like a vivid presentiment, in
that moment of uncertainty and gloom.</p>

<p>"Don't you hear their shouts, my
boy&mdash;" whispered Lorrimer&mdash;"Faith,
they must be <i>drunk</i> as judges, every
man of them! Why Byrnewood,
you're as still as death&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, Lorrimer,
this place looks like the den of some
old wizard&mdash;it's so d&mdash;d gloomy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here we are at the door: Now
mark me, Byrnewood you must
walk in the club-room, or Monk's room
as they call it, directly at my back.
While I salute the Monks of Monk-Hall,
you will slide into a vacant seat
at the table, and mingle in the revelry
of the place until I return&mdash;"</p>

<p>Stooping through a narrow door,
whose receding panels flung a blaze
of light along the darkness of the passage,
Lorrimer, with Byrnewood at
his back, descended three wooden
steps, that led from the door-sill to the
floor, and in a moment, stood amid
the revellers of Monk-Hall.</p>

<p>In a long, narrow room, lighted by
the blaze of a large chandelier, with a
low ceiling and a wide floor, covered
with a double-range of carpets, around

<!-- page 47 col 1 -->

a table spread with the relics of their
feast, were grouped the Monks of
Monk-Hall.</p>

<p>They hailed Lorrimer with a shout,
and as they rose to greet him, Byrnewood
glided into a vacant arm-chair
near the head of the table, and in a
moment his companion had disappeared.</p>

<p>"I'll be with you in a moment,
Monks of Monk-Hall&mdash;" he shouted
as he glided through the narrow door&mdash;"A
little affair to settle up stairs&mdash;you
know me&mdash;nice little girl&mdash;ha-ha-ha&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha-ha-ha&mdash;" echoed the band of
revellers, raising their glasses merrily
on high.</p>

<p>Byrnewood glanced hurriedly
around. The room, long and spacious
as it was, the floor covered with
the most gorgeous carpeting, and the
low ceiling, embellished with a faded
painting in fresco, still wore an antiquated,
not to say, dark and gloomy
appearance. The walls were concealed
by huge panels of wainscot, intricate
with uncouth sculpturings of
fawns and satyrs, and other hideous
creations of classic mythology. At
one end of the room, reaching from
floor to ceiling, glared an immense
mirror, framed in massive walnut, its
glittering surface, reflecting the long
festal board, with its encircling band
of revellers. Inserted in the corresponding
panels of the wainscot, on
either side of the small door, at the
opposite end of the room, two large
pictures, evidently the work of a
master hand, indicated the mingled
worship of the devotees of Monk-Hall.
In the picture on the right of the door,
Bacchus, the jolly god of mirth and

<!-- page 47 col 2 -->

wine, was represented rising from a
festal board, his brow wreathed in
clustering grapes, while his hand
swung aloft, a goblet filled with the
purple blood of the grape. In the
other painting, along a couch as dark
as night, with a softened radiance
falling over her uncovered form, lay a
sleeping Venus, her full arms, twining
above her head, while her lips were
dropped apart, as though she murmured
in her slumber. Straight and erect,
behind the chair of the President or
Abbot of the board, arose the effigy of
a monk, whose long black robes fell
drooping to the floor, while his cowl
hung heavily over his brow, and his
right hand raised on high a goblet of
gold. From beneath the shadow of
the falling cowl, glared a fleshless
skeleton head, with the orbless eye-sockets,
the cavity of the nose, and
the long rows of grinning teeth, turned
to a faint and ghastly crimson by the
lamp-beams. The hand that held the
goblet on high, was a grisly skeleton
hand; the long and thin fingers of
bone, twining firmly around the glittering
bowl.</p>

<p>And over this scene, over the paintings
and the mirror, over the gloomy
wainscot along the walls, and over the
faces of the revellers with the Skeleton-Monk,
grinning derision at their scene
of bestial enjoyment, shone the red
beams of the massive chandelier, the
body and limbs of which were fashioned
into the form of a grim Satyr, with a
light flaring from his skull, a flame
emerging from each eye, while his extended
hands flung streams of fire on
either side, and his knees were huddled
up against his breast. The design was
like a nightmare dream, so grotesque

<!-- page 48 col 1 -->

and terrible, and it completed the
strange and ghostly appearance of the
room.</p>

<p>Around the long and narrow board,
strewn with the relics of the feast,
which had evidently been some hours
in progress, sate the Monks of Monk-Hall,
some thirty in number, flinging
their glasses on high, while the room
echoed with their oaths and drunken
shouts. Some lay with their heads
thrown helplessly on the table, others
were gazing round in sleepy drunkenness,
others had fallen to the floor in
a state of unconscious intoxication,
while a few there were who still kept
up the spirit of the feast, although
their incoherent words and heavy eyes
proclaimed that they too were fast advancing
to that state of brutal inebriety,
when strange-looking stars shine in
the place of the lamps, when the bottles
dance and even tables perform the
cracovienne, while all sorts of bee
hives create a buzzing murmur in the
air.</p>

<p>And the Monks of Monk-Hall&mdash;who
are they?</p>

<p>Grim-faced personages in long black
robes and drooping cowls? Stern old
men with beads around their necks
and crucifix in hand? Blood-thirsty
characters, perhaps, or black-browed
ruffians, or wan-faced outcasts of society?</p>

<p>Ah no, ah no! From the eloquent,
the learned, and&mdash;don't you
laugh&mdash;from the pious of the Quaker
City, the old Skeleton-Monk had selected
the members of his band. Here
were lawyers from the court, doctors
from the school, and judges* from the

<!-- page 48 col 2 -->

bench. Here too, ruddy and round
faced, sate a demure parson, whose
white hands and soft words, had made
him the idol of his wealthy congregation.
Here was a puffy-faced Editor
side by side with a Magazine Proprietor;
here were sleek-visaged tradesmen,
with round faces and gouty hands,
whose voices, now shouting the drinking
song had re-echoed the prayer
and the psalm in the aristocratic
church, not longer than a Sunday
ago; here were solemn-faced merchants,
whose names were wont to
figure largely in the records of 'Bible
Societies,' 'Tract Societies' and  'Send
Flannel-to-the-South-Sea-Islanders Societies;'
here were reputable married
men, with grown up children at college,
and trustful wives sleeping
quietly in their dreamless beds at
home; here were hopeful sons, clerks
in wholesale stores, who raised the
wine-glass on high with hands which,
not three hours since, had been busy
with the cash-book of the employer;
here in fine were men of all classes,&mdash;poets,
authors, lawyers, judges,
doctors, merchants, gamblers,
and&mdash;this is no libel I hope&mdash;<i>one</i> parson,
a fine red-faced parson, whose
glowing face would have warmed a
poor man on a cold day. Moderately
drunk, or deeply drunk, or vilely
drunk, all the members of the board
who still maintained their arm-chairs,
kept up a running fire of oaths, disjointed
remarks, mingled with small talk
very much broken, and snatches of
bacchanalian songs, slightly improved
by a peculiar chorus of hiccups.</p>

<p class="small">[*This of course alludes to Judges of distant
country courts.]</p>

<p>While Byrnewood, with a sleeping
man on either side of him, gazed
around in sober wonder, this was

<!-- page 49 col 1 -->

the fashion of the conversation among
the Monks of Monk-Hall.</p>

<p>"Judge&mdash;I say, judge&mdash;that last
Charge o' yours was capital&mdash;" hiccupped
a round-faced lawyer, leaning
over the table&mdash;"Touched on the
vices of the day&mdash;ha&mdash;ha! 'Dens
of iniquity and holes of wickedness'&mdash;its
very words!&mdash;exist in city, which
want the strong arm of the law to uproot
and ex-ex&mdash;d&mdash;n the hard
words&mdash;exterminate them!' "</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;my&mdash;very&mdash;words&mdash;"
replied the Judge, who sat gazing
around with a smile of imbecile fatuity&mdash;"Yet,
Bellamy, not quite so good
as your words, when your wife&mdash;how
this d&mdash;d room swims&mdash;found
out your <i>liaison</i> with the Actress! Ha&mdash;ha,
gents&mdash;too d&mdash;d good that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha&mdash;" laughed some
dozen of the company&mdash;"let's hear it&mdash;let's
hear it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;you&mdash;see&mdash;" replied the
Judge&mdash;"Bellamy is <i>so</i> d&mdash;d fat, (just
keep them bottles from dancing about
the table!) so <i>very</i> fat, that the i-i-idea
of his writing a love-letter is rath-rather
improbable. Nevertheless&mdash;he
did&mdash;to a pretty actress, Madame De
Flum&mdash;and left it on his office table.
His wife found it&mdash;oh Lord&mdash;what
a scene! ranted&mdash;raved&mdash;tore her
hair. 'My dear&mdash;' said our fat
friend, 'do be calm&mdash;this is the copy
of a letter in a breach of promise case,
on which I am about to bring suit for

the names is the fault of my clerk.

swallowed the story&mdash;clever story for
a fat man&mdash;very!"</p>

<p>"Friends and Brethren, what shall
ye do to be saved?" shouted the beefy-faced

<!-- page 49 col 2 -->

parson, in the long-drawn nasal
tones peculiar to his pulpit or lecture-room&mdash;"When
we con-consider the
wickedness of the age, when we reflect
tha-that there are thousands da-i-ly
and hou-r-ly going down to per-perdition,
should we not cry from the
depths of our souls, like Jonah from
the depths of the sea&mdash;I say, give us
the brandy, Mutchins!"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, allow me to read you
a poem&mdash;" muttered a personage,
whose cheeks blushed from habitual
kisses of the bottle, as he staggered
from his chair, and endeavored to
stand erect&mdash;"It's a&mdash;poem&mdash;on
(what an unsteady floor this is&mdash;hold
it, Petriken, I say)&mdash;on the Ten Commandments.
I've dedicated it to our
Rev-Reverend friend yonder. There's
a touch in it, gentlemen&mdash;if I may
use the expression&mdash;above ordinary
buttermilk. A sweetness, a path-pathos,
a mildness, a-a-vein, gentlemen,
of the strictest mo-ral-i-ty. I
will read sonnet one&mdash;'Thou shalt
not take the co-eternal name'&mdash;eh?
Dammit! This is <i>a bill!</i> I've left
the sonnet at home&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Curse it&mdash;how I'll cut this fellow
up in my next Black Mail!" murmured
the puffy-faced editor, in a tone
which he deemed inaudible to the poet&mdash;"Unless
he comes down handsome&mdash;I'll
give him a stinger, a real
scorcher&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you, though?" shouted the
poet, turning round with a drunken
stare, and aiming a blow at the half-stupid
face of the editor&mdash;"Take that
you fungus&mdash;you abortion&mdash;you
d&mdash;d gleaner of a common sewer&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I con-consider myself

<!-- page 50 col 1 -->

grossly insulted&mdash;" muttered the editor,
as the poet's blow took effect on
his wig and sent it spinning to the
other end of the table&mdash;"Is the <i>Daily
Black Mail</i> come to this?"</p>

<p>Here he made a lunge at the author
of the "Ten Commandments, a Series
of Sonnets," and, joined in a fond embrace,
they fell insensible to the floor.</p>

<p>"Take that wig out of my plate&mdash;"
shouted a deep voice from the head of
the table&mdash;"Wigs, as a general thing,
are not very nice with oysters, but
that fellow's wig&mdash;ugh! Faugh!"</p>

<p>Attracted by the sound of the voice,
Byrnewood glanced towards the head
of the table. There, straight and erect,
sate the Abbot of the night, a gentleman
elected by the fraternity to preside
over their feasts. He was a man
of some thirty odd years, dressed in a
suit of glossy black, with a form remarkable
for its combination of
strength with symmetry. His face,
long and dusky, lighted by the gleam
of a dark eye, indicating the man whose
whole life had been one series of plot,
scheme, and intrigue, was relieved
by heavy masses of long black hair
resembling, in its texture, the mane of
a horse&mdash;which fell in curling locks
to his shoulders. It needed not a
second glance to inform Byrnewood
that he beheld the hero of Chestnut
Street, the distinguished millionaire,
Col. Fitz-Cowles. The elegant cut
of his dark vest, which gathered over
his prominent chest and around his
slender waist, with the nicety of a
glove, the plain black scarf, fastened
by a breast-pin of solid gold, the
glossy black of his dress coat, shapen
of the best French cloth, all disclosed
the idol of the tailors, the dream of

<!-- page 50 col 2 -->

the fashionable belles, the envy of the
dry goods clerks, Algernon Fitz-Cowles.
He seemed, by far, the most
sober man in the company. Every
now and then Byrnewood beheld him
glance anxiously toward the door as
though he wished to escape from the
room. And after every glance, as he
beheld one Monk after another kissing
the carpet, bottle in hand, the interesting
Colonel would join heartily in the
drunken bout, raising his voice with
the loudest, and emptying his glass with
the most drunken. Yet, to the eye
of Byrnewood, this looked more like
a mere counterfeit of a drunkard's
manner than the thing itself. It was
evident that the handsome millionaire
emptied his glass under the table.</p>

<p>The revel now grew wild and
furious. As bottle after bottle was
consumed, so the actors in the scene
began to appear, more and more, in
their true characters. At last all disguise
seemed thrown aside, and each
voice, joining in the chorus of disjointed
remarks, indicated that its owner
imagined himself amid the scenes of
his daily life.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen&mdash;allow&mdash;me&mdash;to read
you a tale&mdash;a tale from the German
on <i>Transcendental Essences</i>&mdash;" cried
Petriken, rising, for he too was there,
forgetful, like Mutchins, of his promise
to Lorrimer&mdash;"This, gents, is a
tale for my next Western Hem.:" here
his oyster-like eyes rolled ghastily&mdash;"The
Ladies Western Hem., forty-eight
pages&mdash;monthly&mdash;offers following

at this point of his handbill the gentleman
staggered wofully&mdash;"Office No.

<!-- page 51 col 1 -->

Mutchins what's your idea of soft
crabs?"</p>

<p>Here the literary gentleman fell
heavily to the floor, mingled in the
same heap that contained the poet and
the wigless editor. In a moment he
rose heavily to his feet, and staggered
slowly to Mutchins' side.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the jury, I charge
you&mdash;" began the Judge.</p>

<p>"Your honor, I beg leave to open
this case&mdash;" interrupted the lawyer.</p>

<p>"My friends and brethren," cried
the parson&mdash;"what shall ye do to be
saved&mdash;oh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hand us the brandy&mdash;" shouted
Mutchins.</p>

<p>"Mutchy&mdash;Mutchy&mdash;I say&mdash;"
hiccupped Petriken&mdash;"Rem-Rem-em-ber
the gown and the prayer-book&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silly&mdash;we must take a wash-off&mdash;"
cried Mutchins, starting suddenly
from his seat&mdash;"The thing&mdash;had
slipped my memory&mdash;this way,
my parson&mdash;ha, ha, ha&mdash;"</p>

<p>And taking Silly by the arm, he
staggered from the room in company
with the tow-haired gentleman.</p>

<p>"Lord look down upon these thy
children, and&mdash;" continued the parson,
who, like the others, appeared
unconscious of the retreat of Petriken
and his comrade.</p>

<p>"Hand the oysters this way&mdash;"
remarked a mercantile gentleman,
with a nose decorated by yellowish
streaks from a mustard bottle.</p>

<p>"Boys I tell you the fire's up this
alley&mdash;" cried another merchant&mdash;
rather an amateur in fires when sober&mdash;"Here's
 the plug&mdash;now then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the Grand Jury, I
beg leave to tell you that the amount
of sin committed in this place, in your

<!-- page 51 col 2 -->

very eyesight, cannot be tolerated by
the court any longer. Dens of iniquity
must be uprooted&mdash;who the
h&mdash;ll flung that celery stalk in my
eye?"</p>

<p>"Who soaked my cigar in champagne?"</p>

<p>"Somebody's lit another chandelier&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hand us the brandy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you say I didn't put down
my name for 'one hundred,' to the
Tract Society?"</p>

<p>"No I didn't, but I do now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say it again, and I'll tie you up
in a meal bag&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My friends&mdash;" said the reverend
gentleman, staggering to his feet
"What is this I see&mdash;confusion and
drunkenness? Is this a scene for the
house of God?" He glanced around
with a look of sober reproof, and then
suddenly exclaimed&mdash;"No heeltaps
but show your bottoms&mdash;ha-ha-ha!"</p>

<p>There was another person who regarded
this scene of bestial mirth with
the same cool glance as Byrnewood.
He was a young man with a massive
face, and a deep piercing brown eye.
His figure was somewhat stout, his
attire careless, and his entire appearance
disclosed the young Philadelphia
lawyer. Changing his seat to Byrnewood's
vicinity, he entered into conversation
with the young merchant,
and after making some pointed remarks
in regard to the various members of
the company, he stated that he had
been lured thither by Mutchins, who
had fancied he might cheat him out of
a snug sum at the roulette table, or the
faro-bank in the course of the night.</p>

<p>"Roulette-table&mdash;faro-bank?" muttered
Byrnewood, incredulously.</p>

<!-- page 52 col 1 -->

<p>"Why, my friend&mdash;" cried the
young lawyer, who gave his name as
Boyd Merivale&mdash;"Don't you know
that this is one of the vilest rookeries
in the world? It unites in all its
details the house-of-ill-fame, the club-house,
and the gambling hell. Egad!

my foot within its doors! What I
beheld then, I can never forget&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have been here before, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes have I! As I perceive you
are unacquainted with the place, I will

<div class="center">

<p class="small">A NIGHT IN MONK-HALL.*</p>

</div>

<p class="small">[*The reader will remember, that Merivale
entered Monk-Hall <i>for no licentious object,
but with the distinct purpose of discovering the
retreat of Western</i>. This story, told in Merivale's
own words, is strictly true.]</p>

<p>"Six years ago, in 1836, on a foggy
night in spring, at the hour of one
o'clock, I found myself reposing in
one of the chambers of this mansion,
on an old-fashioned bed, side by side
with a girl, who, before her seduction,
had resided in my native village. It
was one o'clock when I was aroused
by a hushed sound, like the noise of a
distant struggle. I awoke, started up
in bed, and looked round. The room
was entirely without light, save from
the fire-place, where a few pieces of
half-burned wood, emitted a dim and
uncertain flame. Now it flashed up
brightly, giving a strange lustre to the
old furniture of the room, the high-backed
mahogany chairs, the antiquated
bureau, and the low ceiling,
with heavy cornices around the walls.
Again the flame died away and all
was darkness. I listened intently. I

<!-- page 52 col 2 -->

could hear no sound, save the breathing
of the girl who slept by my side.
And as I listened, a sudden awe came
over me. True, I heard no noise, but
that my sleep had been broken by a
most appalling sound, I could not doubt.
And the stories I had heard of Monk-Hall
came over me. Years before, in
my native village, a wild rollicking
fellow, Paul Western, Cashier of the
County Bank, had indulged my fancy
with strange stories of a brothel, situated
in the outskirts of Philadelphia.
Paul was a wild fellow, rather good
looking, and went often to the city on
business. He spoke of Monk-Hall as
a place hard to find, abounding in
mysteries, and darkened by hideous
crimes committed within its walls. It
had three stories of chambers beneath
the earth, as well as above. Each of
these chambers was supplied with trap-doors,
through the which the unsuspecting
man might be flung by his
murderer, without a moment's warning.
There was but one range of
rooms above the ground, where these
trap-doors existed. From the garret
to the first story, all in the same line,
like the hatchways in a storehouse,
sank this range of trap-doors, all carefully
concealed by the manner in
which the carpets were fixed. A
secret spring in the wall of any one of
these chambers, communicated with
the spring hidden beneath the carpet.
The spring in the wall might be so
arranged, that a single footstep pressed
on the spring, under the carpet, would
open the trap-door, and plunge the
victim headlong through the aperture.
In such cases no man could stride
across the floor without peril of his
life. Beneath the ground another

<!-- page 53 col 1 -->

range of trap-doors were placed in the
same manner, in the floors of three
stories of the subterranean chambers.
They plunged the victim&mdash;God knows
where! With such arrangements for
murder above and beneath the earth,
might there not exist hideous pits or
deep wells, far below the third story
underground, where the body of the
victim would rot in darkness forever?
As I remembered these details, the
connection between Paul Western, the
cheerful bachelor, and Emily Walraven,
the woman who was sleeping at
my side, flashed over my mind. The
child of one of the first men of B&mdash;&mdash;,
educated without regard to expense by
the doating father, with a mind singularly
masculine, and a tall queenly form,
a face distinguished for its beauty and a
manner remarkable for its ladylike elegance,
poor Emily had been seduced,
some three years before, and soon
after disappeared from the town. Her
seducer no one knew, though from
some hints dropped casually by my
friend Paul, I judged that he at least
could tell. Rumors came to the place,
from time to time in relation to the
beautiful but fallen girl. One rumor
stated that she was now living as the
mistress of a wealthy planter, who
made his residence at times in Philadelphia.
Another declared that she
had become a common creature of the
town, and this&mdash;great God, how terrible!&mdash;killed
her poor father. The
rumor flew round the village to-day&mdash;next
Sunday old Walraven was dead
and buried. They say that in his dying
hour he charged Paul Western with
his daughter's shame, and shrieked a
father's curse upon his head. He left
no property, for his troubles had

<!-- page 53 col 2 -->

preyed on his mind until he neglected
his affairs, and he died insolvent.</p>

<p>"Well two years passed on, and no
one heard a word more of poor Emily
Suddenly in the spring of 1836, when
this town as well as the whole Union
was convulsed with the fever of speculation,
Paul Western, after a visit to
Philadelphia, with some funds of the
Bank, amounting to near thirty thousand
dollars, in his possession, suddenly
disappeared, no one knew
whither. My father was largely interested
in the bank. He despatched
me to town, in order that I might
make a desperate effort to track up the
footsteps of Western. Some items in
the papers stated that the Cashier had
fled to Texas, others that he had been
drowned by accident, others that he
had been spirited away. I alone possessed
a clue to the place of his concealment&mdash;thus ran my thoughts at
all events&mdash;and that clue was locked
in the bosom of Emily Walraven, the
betrayed and deeply-injured girl.
Sometime before his disappearance,
and after the death of old Walraven,
Paul disclosed to me, under a solemn
pledge of secrecy, the fact that Emily
was living in Philadelphia, under his
protection, supported by his money.
He stated that he had furnished rooms
at the brothel called Monk-Hall. With
this fact resting on my mind, I had
hurried to Philadelphia. For days my
search for Emily Walraven was in
vain. One night, when about giving up
the chase as hopeless, I strolled to the
Chestnut Street Theatre. Forrest was
playing Richelieu&mdash;there was a row
in the third tier&mdash;a bully had offered
violence to one of the ladies of the
town. Attracted by the noise, I joined

<!-- page 54 col 1 -->

the throng rushing up stairs, and
beheld the girl who had been stricken,
standing pale and erect, a small poignard
in her upraised hand, while her
eyes flashed with rage as she dared
the drunken 'buffer' to strike her again.
I stood thunderstruck as I recognized
Emily Walraven in the degraded yet
beautiful woman who stood before me.
Springing forward, with one blow I
felled the bully to the floor, and in
another moment, seizing Emily by the
arm, I hurried down stairs, evaded the
constables, who were about to arrest
her, and gained the street. It was yet
early in the evening&mdash;there were no
cabs in the street&mdash;so I had to walk
home with her.</p>

<p>"All this I remembered well, as I sat
listening in the lonely room.</p>

<p>"I remembered the big tears that
started from her eyes when she recognized
me, her wild exclamations
when I spoke of her course of life.
'Don't talk to me&mdash;' she had almost
shrieked as we hurried along the
street&mdash;'it's too late for me to
change now. For God's sake let me
be happy in my degradation.'</p>

<p>"I remembered the warm flush of indignation
that reddened over her face,
as pointing carelessly to a figure
which I observed through the fog,
some distance ahead, I exclaimed&mdash;'Is
not that Paul Western yonder?'
Her voice was very deep and not at
all natural in its tone as she replied,
with assumed unconcern&mdash;'I know
nothing about the man.' At last,
after threading a labyrinth of streets,
compared to which the puzzling-garden
was a mere frolic, we had gained
Monk-Hall, the place celebrated by the
wonderful stories of my friend Western.

<!-- page 54 col 2 -->

Egad! As we neared the door
I could have sworn that I beheld
Western himself disappear in the door
but this doubtless, I reasoned, had
been a mere fancy.</p>

<p>"Silence still prevailed in the room,
still I heard but the sound of Emily
breathing in her sleep, and yet my
mind grew more and more heavy,
with some unknown feeling of awe. I
remembered with painful distinctness
the hang-dog aspect of the doorkeeper
who had let us in, and the cut-throat
visages of his two attendants seemed
staring me visibly in the face. I grew
quite nervous. Dark ideas of murder
and the devil knows what, began to
chill my very soul. I bitterly remembered
that I had no arms. The only
thing I carried with me was a slight
cane, which had been lent me by the
Landlord of the &mdash;&mdash; Hotel. It was a
mere switch of a thing.</p>

<p>"As these things came stealing over
me, the strange connection between the
fate of Western and that of the beautiful
woman who lay beside me, the
sudden disappearance of the former,
the mysterious character of Monk-Hall,
the startling sounds which had aroused
me, the lonely appearance of the room,
fitfully lighted by the glare on the
hearth, all combined, deepened the
impression of awe, which had gradually
gained possession of my faculties.
I feared to stir. You may have felt
this feeling&mdash;this strange and incomprehensible
feeling&mdash;but if you have
not, just imagine a man seized with
the night-mare when wide awake.</p>

<p>"I was sitting upright in bed, chilled
to the very heart, afraid to move an
inch, almost afraid to breathe, when,
far, far down through the chambers

<!-- page 55 col 1 -->

of the old mansion, I heard a faint
hushed sound, like a man endeavoring
to cry out when attacked by nightmare,
and then&mdash;great God how distinct!&mdash;I
heard the cry of 'Murder,
murder, murder!' far, far, far below
me.</p>

<p>"The cry aroused Emily from her
sleep. She started up in the bed and
whispered, in a voice without tremor&mdash;'What
is the matter Boyd&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'Listen&mdash;' I cried with chattering
teeth, and again, up from the depths
of the mansion welled that awful
sound, <i>Murder!</i> MURDER! MURDER!
growing louder every time.
Then far, far, far down I could hear
a gurgling sound. It grew fainter
every moment. Fainter, fainter, fainter.
All was still as death.</p>

<p>" 'What does this mean?' I whispered
almost fiercely, turning to Emily
by my side&mdash;'What does this mean?'
And a dark suspicion flashed over my
mind.</p>

<p>"The flame shot upward in the fire-place,
and revealed every line of her
intellectual countenance.</p>

<p>"Her dark eyes looked firmly in my
face as she answered, 'In God's
name I know not!'</p>

<p>"The manner of the answer satisfied
me as to her firmness, if it did not
convince me of her innocence. I sat
silent and sullen, conjuring over the
incidents of the night.</p>

<p>" 'Come, Boyd&mdash;' she cried, as she
arose from the bed&mdash;'You must leave
the house. I never entertain visitors
after this hour. It is my custom. I
thank you for your protection at the
theatre, but you must go home&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Her manner was calm and self-possessed.

<!-- page 55 col 2 -->

I turned to her in perfect
amazement.</p>

<p>" 'I will not leave the house&mdash;' I
said, as a dim vision of being attacked
by assassins on the stairway, arose to
my mind.</p>

<p>" 'There is Devil-Bug and his cut-throat
negroes&mdash;' thought I&mdash;'nothing
so easy as to give me a 'cliff'
with a knife from some dark corner;
nothing so secret as my burial-place
in some dark hole in the cellar&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'I won't go home&mdash;' said I, aloud.</p>

<p>"Emily looked at me in perfect
wonder. It may have been affected,
and it may have been real.</p>

<p>" 'Well then, I must go down stairs
to get something to eat&mdash;' she said,
in the most natural manner in the
world&mdash;'I usually eat something
about this hour&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'You may eat old Devil-Bug and
his niggers, if you like&mdash;' I replied
laughing&mdash;'But out of this house my
father's son don't stir till broad daylight.'</p>

<p>"With a careless laugh, she wound
her night gown round her, opened the
door, and disappeared in the dark.
Down, down, down, I could hear her
go, her footsteps echoing along the
stairway of the old mansion, down,
down, down. In a few moments all
was still.</p>

<p>"Here I was, in a pretty 'fix.' In
a lonely room at midnight, ignorant
of the passages of the wizard's den,
without arms, and with the pleasant
prospect of the young lady coming
back with Devil-Bug and his niggers
to despatch me. I had heard the cry
of 'Murder'&mdash;so ran my reasoning&mdash;they,

<!-- page 56 col 1 -->

that is the murderers&mdash;would
suspect that I was a witness to their
guilt, and, of course, would send me
down some d&mdash;d trap-door on an
especial message to the devil.</p>

<p>"This was decidedly a bad case. I
began to look around the room for
some chance of escape, some arms to
defend myself, or, perhaps from a
motive of laudable curiosity, to know
something more about the place where
my death was to happen.</p>

<p>"One moment, regular as the ticking
of a clock, the room would be illuminated
by a flash of red light from the
fire-place, the next it would be dark as
a grave. Seizing the opportunity afforded
by the flash, I observed some
of the details of the room. On the
right side of the fire-place there was a
closet: the door fastened to the post by
a very singular button, shaped like a
diamond; about as long as your little
finger and twice as thick. On the
other side of the fire-place, near the
ceiling, was a small oblong window,
about as large as two half sheets of
writing paper, pasted together at the
ends. Here let me explain the use of
this window. The back part of Monk-Hall
is utterly destitute of windows.
Light, faint and dim you may be sure,
is admitted from the front by small
windows, placed in the wall of each
room. How many rooms there are
on a floor, I know not, but, be they five
or ten, or twenty, they are all lighted
in this way.</p>

<p>"Well, as I looked at this window, I
perceived one corner of the curtain on
the other side was turned up. This
gave me very unpleasant ideas. I
almost fancied I beheld a human face
pressed against the glass, looking at

<!-- page 56 col 2 -->

me. Then the flash on the hearth
died away, and all was dark. I heard
a faint creaking noise&mdash;the light from
the hearth again lighted the place&mdash;could
I believe my eyes&mdash;the button
on the closet-door turned slowly round!</p>

<p>"Slowly&mdash;slowly&mdash;slowly it turned,
making a slight grating noise. This
circumstance, slight as it may appear
to you, filled me with horror. What
could turn the button, but a human
hand? Slowly, slowly it turned, and
the door sprung open with a whizzing
sound. All was dark again. The
cold sweat stood out on my forehead.
Was my armed murderer waiting to
spring at my throat? I passed a moment
of intense horror. At last,
springing hastily forward, I swung
the door shut, and fastened the button.
I can swear that I fastened it as tight
as ever button was fastened. Regaining
the bed I silently awaited the
result. Another flash of light&mdash;Great
God!&mdash;I could swear there was a
face pressed against the oblong window!
Another moment and it is
darkness&mdash;creak, creak, creak&mdash;is
that the sound of the button again? It
was light again, and there, before my
very eyes, the button moved slowly
round! Slowly, slowly, slowly!</p>

<p>"The door flew open again. I sat
still as a statue. I felt it difficult to
breathe. Was my enemy playing
with me, like the cat ere she destroys
her game!</p>

<p>"I absently extended my hand. It
touched the small black stick given
me by the Landlord of the &mdash;&mdash; Hotel,
in the beginning of the evening. I
drew it to me, like a friend. Grasping
it with both hands, I calculated
the amount of service it might do me.

<!-- page 57 col 1 -->

And as I grasped it, the top seemed
parting from the lower portion of the
cane. Great God! It was a sword
cane! Ha-ha! I could at least strike
<i>one</i> blow! My murderers should not
despatch me without an effort of resistance.
You see my arm is none of
the puniest in the world; I may say
that there are worse men than Boyd
Merivale for a fight.</p>

<p>"Clutching the sword-cane, I rushed
forward, and standing on the threshold
of the opened door, I made a lunge
with all my strength through the darkness
of the recess. Though I extended
my arm to its full length, and the
sword was not less than eighteen
inches long, yet to my utter astonishment,
I struck but the empty air!
Another lunge and the same result!</p>

<p>"Things began to grow rather queer.
I was decidedly beat out as they say.
I shut the closet door again, retreated
to the bed, sword in hand, and awaited
the result. I heard a sound, but it
was the footstep of poor Emily, who
that moment returned with a bed-lamp
in one hand, and a small waiter, supplied
with a boiled chicken and a bottle
of wine in the other. There was
nothing remarkable in her look, her
face was calm, and her boiled chicken
and bottle of wine, decidedly common
place.</p>

<p>" 'Great God&mdash;' she cried as she
gazed in my countenance&mdash;'What
is the matter with you? Your face is
quite livid&mdash;and your eyes are fairly
starting from their sockets&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'Good reason&mdash;' said I, as I felt
that my lips were clammy and white&mdash;That
d&mdash;d button has been going
round ever since you left, and that

<!-- page 57 col 2 -->

d&mdash;d door has been springing open
every time it was shut&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'Ha-ha-ha&mdash;' she laughed&mdash;'Would
it have sprung open if you
had not shut it?'</p>

<p>"This was a very clear question and
easy to answer; but&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'Mark you, my lady&mdash;' said I&mdash;'Here
am I in a lonely house, under
peculiar circumstances. I am waked
up by the cry of 'Murder'&mdash;a door
springs open without a hand being
visible&mdash;a face peers at me through
a window. As a matter of course I
suspect there has been foul work done
here to-night. And through every
room of this house, Emily you must
lead the way, while I follow, this good
sword in hand. If the light goes out,
or if you blow it out, you are to be
pitied, for in either case, I swear by
Living God, I will run you through
with this sword&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'Ha-ha-ha&mdash;' she fairly screamed
with laughter as she sprung to the
closet door&mdash;'Behold the mystery&mdash;'</p>

<p>"And with her fair fingers she pointed
to the socket of the button, and to
the centre of the door. The door had
been 'sprung,' as it is termed, by the
weather. That is, the centre bulged
inward, leaving the edge toward the
door-post to press the contrary direction.
The socket of the button, by
continual wear, had been increased to
twice its original size. Whenever the
door was first buttoned, the head of
the screw pressed against one of the
edges of the socket. In a moment the
pressure of the edge of the door, which
you will remember was directed outward,
dislodged the head of the screw,
and it sank, well-nigh half an inch,

<!-- page 58 col 1 -->

into the worn socket of the button.
Then the button, removed <i>farther</i>
from the door than at first, would
slowly turn, and the door spring open.
All this was plain enough, and I smiled
at my recent fright.</p>

<p>" 'Very good, Emily&mdash;' I laughed&mdash;'But
the mystery of this sword&mdash;what
of that? I made a lunge in the
closet and it touched nothing&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'You are suspicious, Boyd&mdash;' she
answered with a laugh&mdash;'But the
fact is, the closet is rather a deep
one&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'Rather&mdash;' said I&mdash;'and so are
you, my dear&mdash;'</p>

<p>"There may have been something
very meaning in my manner, but certainly,
although her full black eyes
looked fixedly on me, yet I thought
her face grew a shade paler as I
spoke.</p>

<p>" 'And my dear&mdash;' I continued&mdash;'What
do you make of the face peeping
through the window:&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'All fancy&mdash;all fancy&mdash;' she replied,
but as she spoke I saw her eye
glance hurriedly toward the very window.
Did she <i>too</i> fear that she might
behold the face?</p>

<p>" 'We will search the closet&mdash;' I
remarked, throwing open the door&mdash;'What
have we here? Nothing but
an old cloak hanging to a hook&mdash;let's
try it with my sword!'</p>

<p>"Again I made a lunge with my
sword: again I thrust at the empty
air.</p>

<p>" 'Emily, there is a room beyond
this cloak&mdash;you will enter first if you
please. Remember my warning about
the light if you please&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'Oh now that I remember, this
closet <i>does</i> open into the next room&mdash;'

<!-- page 58 col 2 -->

she said gaily, although her cheek&mdash;so
it struck me&mdash;grew a little paler,
and her lip trembled slightly&mdash;'I
had quite forgotten the circumstance&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'Enter Emily, and don't forget
the light&mdash;'</p>

<p>"She flung the door aside and passed
on with the light in her hand. I followed
her. We stood in a small room,
lighted like the other by an oblong
window. There was no other window,
no door, no outlet of any sort. Even
a chimney-place was wanting. In one
corner stood a massive bed&mdash;the quilt
was unruffled. Two or three old
fashioned chairs were scattered round
the room, and from the spot where I
stood looking over the foot of the bed,
I could see the top of another chair,
and nothing more, between the bed
and the wall.</p>

<p>"A trifling fact in Emily's behavior
may be remarked. The moment the
light of the lamp which she held in her
land flashed round the room, she
turned to me with a smile, and leading
the way round the corner of the foot
of the bed, asked me in a pleasant
voice 'Did I see anything remarkable
there?'</p>

<p>"She shaded her eyes from the lamp
as she spoke, and toyed me playfully
under the chin. You will bear in
mind that at this moment, I had turned
my face toward the closet by which
we had entered. My back was therefore
toward the part of the room most
remote from the closet. It was a trifling
fact, but I may as well tell you,
that the manner in which Emily held
the light, threw that portion of the
room, between the foot of the bed and
the wall in complete shadow, while

<!-- page 59 col 1 -->

the rest of the chamber was bright as
day.</p>

<p>"Smilingly Emily toyed me under
the chin, and at that moment I thought
she looked extremely beautiful.</p>

<p>"By Jove! I wish you could have
seen her eyes shine, and her cheek&mdash;Lord
bless you&mdash;a full blown rose
wasn't a circumstance to it. She
looked so beautiful, in fact, as she
came sideling up to me, that I stepped
backward in order to have a full view
of her before I pressed a kiss on her
pouting lips. I did step back, and did
kiss her. It wasn't singular, perhaps,
but her lips were hot as a coal. Again
she advanced to me, again chucked
me under the chin. Again I stepped
back to look at her, again I wished to
taste her lips so pouting, but rather
warm, when&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, stranger, even
at this late day the remembrance
makes my blood run cold!</p>

"&mdash;&mdash;When I heard a sound like
the sweeping of a tree-limb against
a closed shutter, it was so faint and
distant, and a stream of cold air came
rushing up my back.</p>

<p>"I turned around carelessly to ascertain
the cause. I took but a single
glance, and then&mdash;by G&mdash;d&mdash;I
sprung at least ten feet from the place.
There, at my very back, between the
bed and the wall, opposite its foot, I
beheld a carpeted space some three
feet square, sinking slowly down, and
separating itself from the floor. I had
stepped my foot upon the spring&mdash;made
ready for me, to be sure&mdash;and
the trap-door sank below me.</p>

<p>"You may suppose my feelings were
somewhat excited. In truth, my
heart, for a moment, felt as though it

<!-- page 59 col 2 -->

was turning to a ball of ice. First I
looked at the trap-door and then at
Emily. Her face was pale as ashes,
and she leaned, trembling, against the
bedpost. Advancing, sword in hand,
I gazed down the trap-door. Great
God! how dark and gloomy the pit
looked! From room to room, from
floor to floor, a succession of traps
had fallen&mdash;far below&mdash;it looked like
a mile, although that was but an exaggeration
natural to a highly excited
mind&mdash;far, far below gleamed a light,
and a buzzing murmur came up this
hatchway of death.</p>

<p>"Stooping slowly down, sword in
hand, my eye on the alert for Miss
Emily, I disengaged a piece of linen,
from a nail, near the edge of the trap
door. Where the linen&mdash;it was a shirt
wristband&mdash;had been fastened, the carpet
was slightly torn, as though a man
in falling had grasped it with his finger
ends.</p>

<p>"The wristband was, in more correct
language, a ruffle for the wrist. It
came to my mind, in this moment, that
I had often ridiculed Paul Western for
his queer old bachelor ways. Among
other odd notions, he had worn ruffles
at his wrist. As I gathered this
little piece of linen in my grasp, the
trap-door slowly rose. I turned to
look for Miss Emily, she had changed
her position, and stood pressing her
hand against the opposite wall.</p>

<p>" 'Now, Miss Emily, my dear&mdash;' I
cried, advancing toward her&mdash;'Give
me a plain answer to a plain question&mdash;and
tell me&mdash;what in the devil do
you think of yourself?'</p>

<p>"Perfectly white in the face, she
glided across the room and stood at the
foot of the bed, in her former position,

<!-- page 60 col 1 -->

leaning against the post for support.
You will observe that her form concealed
the chair, whose top I had only
seen across the bed.</p>

<p>" 'Step aside, Miss Emily, my dear&mdash;'
I said, in as quiet a tone as I
could command&mdash;'Or you see, my
lady, I'll have to use a little necessary
force&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Instead of stepping aside, as a
peaceable woman would have done,
she sits right down in the chair, fixing
those full black eyes of hers on my
face, with a glance that looked very
much like madness.</p>

<p>"Extending my hand, I raised her
from the seat. She rested like a dead
weight in my arms. She had fainted.
Wrapped in her night-gown, I laid her
on the bed, and then examined the
chair in the corner. Something about
this chair attracted my attention. A
coat hung over the round&mdash;a blue
coat with metal buttons. A buff vest
hung under this coat; and a high
stock, with a shirt collar.</p>

<p>"I knew these things at once. They
belonged to my friend, Paul Western.</p>

<p>" 'And so, my lady&mdash;' I cried, forgetting
that she had fainted; 'Mr.
Western came home, from the theatre,
to his rooms, arrived just before us,
took off his coat and vest, and stock
and collar&mdash;maybe was just about to
take off his boots&mdash;when he stepped
on the spring and in a moment was
in&mdash;in h&mdash;ll&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Taking the light in one hand, I
dragged or carried her, into the other
room and laid her on the bed. After
half an hour or so, she came to her
senses.</p>

<p>" 'You see&mdash;you see&mdash;' were her
first words uttered, with her eyes flashing

<!-- page 60 col 2 -->

like live-coals, and her lips white
as marble&mdash;'You see, I could not
help it, for my father's curse was upon
him!'</p>

<p>"She laughed wildly, and lay in my
arms a maniac.</p>

<p>"Stranger, I'll make a short story of
the thing now. How I watched her
all night till broad day, how I escaped
from the house&mdash;for Mr. Devil-Bug, it
seems, didn't suspect I knew anything&mdash;how
I returned home without any news
of Paul Western, are matters as easy
to conceive as tell.</p>

<p>"Why didn't I institute a search?
Fiddle-faddle! Blazon my name to
the world as a visitor to a Bagnio?
Sensible thing, that! And then, although
I was sure in my own soul,
that the clothes which I had discovered
belonged to Paul Western, it would
have been most difficult to establish
this fact in Court. One word more
and I have done.</p>

<p>"Never since that night has Paul
Western been heard of by living man.
Never since that night has Emily
Walraven been seen in this breathing
world. You start. Let me whisper
a word in your ear. Suppose Emily
joined in Western's murder from motives
of revenge, what then were
Devil-Bug's? (<i>He</i> of course was the
real murderer.) Why the money to be
sure. Why be troubled with Emily as
a witness of his guilt, or a sharer of
his money? This is rather a&mdash;a
<i>dark house,</i> and it's my opinion,
stranger, that <i>he murdered her too!</i></p>

<p>"Ha-ha&mdash;why here's all the room
to ourselves! All the club have either
disappeared, or lie drunk on the floor!
I saw Fitz-Cowles&mdash;I know him&mdash;sneak
off a few moments since&mdash;I

<!-- page 61 col 1 -->

could tell by his eye that he is after
some devil's-trick! The parson has
gone, and the judge has gone, the
lawyer has fallen among the slain,
and so, wishing you good night,
stranger, I'll vanish! Beware of the
Monks of Monk-Hall!"</p>

<p>Byrnewood was alone.</p>

<p>His head was depressed, his arms
were folded, and his eye, gazing
vacantly on the table, shone and
glistened with the internal agitation of
his brain. He sate there, silent, motionless,
awed to the very soul. The
story of the stranger had thrilled him
to the heart, had aroused a strange
train of thought, and now rested like
an oppressive weight upon his brain.</p>

<p>Byrnewood gazed around. With a
sudden effort he shook off the spell
of absence which mingled with an
incomprehensible feeling of awe, had
enchained his faculties. He looked
around the room. He was, indeed,
alone. Above him, the hideous Satyr
chandelier, still flared its red light
ever the table, over the mirror, and
along the gloomy wainscot of the
walls. Around the table, grouped in
various attitudes of unconscious drunkenness,
lay the members of the
drinking party, the merry Monks of
Monk-Hall. There lay the poet, with
his sanguine face shining redly in the
light, while his hand rested on the
bare scalp of the wigless editor, there
snored some dozen merchants, all
doubled up together, like the slain in
battle, and there, a solitary doctor,
who had fallen asleep on his knees,
was dozing away with one eye wide
open, while his right hand brushed
away a solitary fly from his pimpled
nose.</p>

<!-- page 61 col 2 -->

<p>The scene was not calculated to
produce the most serious feelings in
the world. There was inebriety&mdash;as
the refined phrase it&mdash;in every
shape, inebriety on its face, inebriety
with its mouth wide open, inebriety on
its knees brushing a fly from its nose,
inebriety groaning, grunting, or snoring,
inebriety doubled up&mdash;mingled in
a mass of limbs, heads and bodies,
woven together&mdash;or flat inebriety simply
straightened out on its back with
its nose performing a select overture
of snores. To be brief, there, scattered
over the floor, lay drunkenness&mdash;as
the vulgar will style it&mdash;in every
shape, modeled after various patterns,
and taken by that ingenious artist, the
Bottle, fresh from real life.</p>

<p>Raising his eyes from the prostrate
members of the club, Byrnewood started
with involuntary surprise as he beheld,
standing at the tables-head, the
black-robed figure of the Skeleton-Monk,
with his hand of bone flinging
aloft the goblet, while his fleshless
brow glared in the light, from the
shadow of the falling cowl. As
the light flickered to and fro, it gave
the grinning teeth of the Skeleton the
appearance of life and animation for a
single moment. Byrnewood thought
he beheld the teeth move in a ghastly
smile; he even fancied that the orbless
sockets, gleaming beneath the white
brow, flashed with the glance of life,
and gazed sneeringly in his face.</p>

<p>He started with involuntary horror,
and then sate silent as before. And
as you can feel cold or heat steal over
you by slow degrees, so he felt that
same strange feeling of awe, which he
had known that night for the first time
in his life, come slowly over him,

<!-- page 62 col 1 -->

moving like a shadow over his soul,
and stealing like a paralysis through
his every limb. He sate like a man
suddenly frozen.</p>

<p>"My God!" he murmured&mdash;and
the sound of his voice frightened him&mdash;"How
strange I feel! Can this be
the first attack of some terrible disease&mdash;or&mdash;is
it, but the effect of the
horrible story related by the stranger?
I have read in books that a feeling like
this steals over a man, just before
some terrible calamity breaks over his
head&mdash;this is fearful as death itself!"</p>

<p>He was silent again, and then the
exclamation broke from his lips&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lorrimer&mdash;why does he not return?
He has been absent full an
hour&mdash;what does it mean? Can the
words of that&mdash;pshaw! that fortune
teller have any truth in them? How
can Lorrimer injure me&mdash;how can I
injure him? Three days hence&mdash;Christmas&mdash;ha,
ha&mdash;I believe I'm
going mad&mdash;there's cold sweat on
my forehead&mdash;"</p>

<p>As he spoke he raised his left hand
to his brow, and in the action, the
gleam of a plain ring on his finger
met his eye. He kissed it suddenly,
and kissed it again and again. Was
it the gift of his ladye-love?</p>

<p>"God bless her&mdash;God bless her!
Wo to the man who shall do <i>her</i>
wrong&mdash;and yet poor Annie&mdash;"</p>

<p>He rose suddenly from his seat and
strode towards the door.</p>

<p>"I know not why it is, but I feel as
though an invisible hand, was urging
me onward through the rooms of this
house! And onward I will go, until
I discover Lorrimer or solve the mystery
of this den. God knows, I

<!-- page 62 col 2 -->

feel&mdash;pshaw! I'm only nervous&mdash;as
though I was walking to my death."</p>

<p>Passing through the narrow doorway,
he cautiously ascended the dark
staircase, and in a moment stood on
the first floor. The moon was still
shining through the distant skylight,
down over the windings of the massive
stairway. All was silent as death
within the mansion. Not a sound, not
even the murmur of a voice or the
hushed tread of a footstep could be
heard. Winding his cloak tightly
around his limbs, Byrnewood rushed
up the staircase, traversing two steps
at a time, and treading softly, for fear
of discovery. He reached the second
floor. Still the place was silent and
dismal, still the column of moonlight
pouring through the skylight, over the
windings of the staircase only rendered
the surrounding darkness more
gloomy and indistinct. Up the winding
staircase he again resumed his
way, and in a moment stood upon the
landing or hall of the third floor. This
was an oblong space, with the doors
of many rooms fashioned in its walls.
Another stairway led upward from the
floor, but the attention of Byrnewood
was arrested by a single ray of light,
that for a moment flickered along the
thick darkness of the southern end of
the hall. Stepping forward hastily,
Byrnewood found all progress arrested
by the opposing front of a solid wall.
He gazed toward his left&mdash;it was so
dark, that he could not see his hand
before his eyes. Turning his glance
to the right, as his vision became
more accustomed to the darkness, he
beheld the dim walls of a long corridor,
at whose entrance he stood, and

<!-- page 63 col 1 -->

whose farther extreme was illumined by
a light, that to all appearance, flashed
from an open door. Without a moment's
thought he strode along the
thickly carpeted passage of the corridor;
he stood in the full glow of the
light flashing from the open door.</p>

<p>Looking through the doorway, he
beheld a large chamber furnished in a
style of lavish magnificence, and
lighted by a splendid chandelier. It
was silent and deserted. From the
ceiling to the floor, along the wall opposite
the doorway, hung a curtain of
damask silk, trailing in heavy folds,
along the gorgeous carpet. Impelled
by the strange impulse, that had urged
him thus far, Byrnewood entered the
chamber, and without pausing to admire
its gorgeous appointments, strode
forward to the damask curtain.</p>

<p>He swung one of its hangings aside,
expecting to behold the extreme wall
of the chamber. To his entire wonder,
another chamber, as spacious as the
one in which he stood, lay open to his
gaze. The walls were all one gorgeous
picture, evidently painted by a
master-hand. Blue skies, deep green
forests, dashing waterfalls and a cool
calm lake, in which fair women were
laving their limbs, broke on the eyes
of the intruder, as he turned his gaze
from wall to wall. A curtain of azure,
sprinkled with a border of golden
leaves, hung along the farther extremity
of the room. In one corner
stood a massive bed, whose snow-white
counterpane, fell smoothly and
unruffled to the very floor, mingling
with the long curtains, which pure
and stainless as the counterpane, hung
around the couch in graceful festoons,

<!-- page 63 col 2 -->

like the wings of a bird guarding its
resting place.</p>

<p>"The bridal-bed!" murmured
Byrnewood, as he flung the curtains
of gold and azure, hurriedly aside.</p>

<p>A murmur of surprise, mingled
with admiration, escaped from his
lips, as he beheld the small closet, for
it could scarcely be called a room,
which the undrawn curtaining threw
open to his gaze.</p>

<p>It was indeed a small and elegant
room, lined along its four sides with
drooping curtains of faint-hued crimson
silk. The ceiling itself was but a
continuation of these curtains, or
hangings, for they were gathered in
the centre, by a single star of gold.
The carpet on the floor was of the
same faint-crimson color, and the
large sofa, placed along one side of
the apartment, was covered with velvet,
that harmonized in hue, with both
carpet and hangings. On the snow-white
cloth, of a small table placed in
the centre of the room, stood a large
wax candle, burning in a candlestick
of silver, and flinging a subdued and
mellow light around the plate. There
was a neat little couch, standing in the
corner, with a <i>toilette</i> at its foot. The
quilt on the couch was ruffled, as
though some one had lately risen
from it, and the equipage of the <i>toilette</i>
looked as though it had been recently
used.</p>

<p>The faint light falling over the
hangings, whose hue resembled the
first flush of day, the luxurious sofa,
the neat though diminutive couch, the
small table in the centre, the carpet
whose colors were in elegant harmony
with the hue of the curtains, all combined,

<!-- page 64 col 1 -->

gave the place an air of splendid
comfort&mdash;if we may join these
incongruous words&mdash;that indicated the
sleeping chamber of a lovely woman.</p>

<p>"This has been the resting place of
the <i>bride</i>&mdash;" murmured Byrnewood,
gazing in admiration around the room&mdash;"It
looks elegant it is true, but
if she is the innocent thing Lorrimer
would have me believe, then better for
her, to have slept in the foulest gutter
of the streets, than to have lain for an
instant in this woman-trap&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a woman's dress&mdash;a
frock of plain black silk&mdash;flung over
one of the rounds of the sofa. Anxious
to gather some idea of the form of the
bride&mdash;oh foul prostitution of the
name!&mdash;from the shape of the dress,
Byrnewood raised the frock and examined
its details. As he did this, the
sound of voices came hushed and
murmuring to his ear from a room,
opposite the chamber which he had
but a moment left. Half occupied in
listening to these voices, Byrnewood
glanced at the dress which he held in
his hand, and as he took in its various
details of style and shape, the pupil of
his full black eye dilated, and his
cheek became colorless as death.</p>

<p>Then the room seemed to swim
around him, and he pressed his hand
forcibly against his brow, as if to
assure himself, that he was not entangled
in the mazes of some hideous
dream.</p>

<p>Then, letting his own cloak and
the black silk dress fall on the floor at
once, he walked with a measured step
toward that side of the room opposite
the Painted Chamber.</p>

<p>The voices grew louder in the next
room. Byrnewood listened in silence.

<!-- page 64 col 2 -->

His face was even paler than before,
and you could see how desperate was
the effort which he made to suppress
an involuntary cry of horror, that
came rising to his lips. Extending his
hand, he pushed the curtain slightly
aside, and looked into the next room.</p>

<p>The extended hand fell like a dead
weight to his side.</p>

<p>Over his entire countenance flashed
a mingled expression of surprise, and
horror, and woe, that convulsed every
feature with a spasmodic movement,
and forced his large black eyes from
their very sockets. For a moment he
looked as if about to fall lifeless on the
floor, and then it was evident that he
exerted all his energies to control this
most fearful agitation. He pressed
both hands nervously against his forehead,
as though his brain was tortured
by internal flame. Then he reared
his form proudly erect, and stood apparently
firm and self-possessed, although
his countenance looked more
like the face of a corpse than the face
of a living man.</p>

<p>And as he stood there, silent and
firm, although his very reason tottered
to its ruin, there glided to his back,
like an omen of death, pursuing the
footsteps of life, the distorted form of
the Doorkeeper of Monk-Hall, his huge
bony arms upraised, his hideous face
convulsed in a loathsome grin, while his
solitary eye glared out from its sunken
socket, like a flame lighted in a skull,
grotesque yet terrible.</p>

<p>In vain was the momentary firmness
which Byrnewood had aroused to
his aid! In vain was the effort that
suppressed his breath, that clenched
his hands, that forced the clammy sweat

<!-- page 65 col 1 -->

from his brow! He felt the awful
agony that convulsed his soul rising
to his lips&mdash;he would have given the
world to stifle it&mdash;but in vain, in vain
were all his superhuman efforts!</p>

<p>One terrific howl, like the yell of a
man flung suddenly over a cataract,
broke from his lips. He thrust aside
the curtain, and strode madly through
its folds into the next room.</p>

<p>CHAPTER EIGHTH.</p>

<p class="small">MOTHER NANCY AND LONG-HAIRED
BESS.</p>

</div>

<p>"SO YE have lured the pretty dove
into the cage, at last&mdash;" said the old
lady, with a pleasant smile, as she
poised a nice morsel of buttered toast
between her fingers&mdash;"This tea is
most too weak&mdash;a little more out of
the caddy, Bessie, dear. Lord! who'd
a-thought you'd a-caught the baby-face
so easy! Does the kettle boil, my
dear? I put it on the fire before you
left, and you've been away near an
hour, so it ought to be hissing hot by
this time. Caught her at last! Hah-hah&mdash;hey?
Bessie? You're a reg'lar
keen one, I must say!"</p>

<p>And with these mild words the old
lady arranged the tea things on the
small table, covered with a neat white
cloth, and pouring out a cup of "Gunpowder,"
chuckled pleasantly to herself,
as though she and the buttered
toast had a quiet little joke together.</p>

<p>"Spankin' cold night, I tell ye,
Mother Nancy&mdash;" exclaimed the
young lady in black, as she flung herself
in a chair, and tossed her bonnet

<!-- page 65 col 2 -->

on the old sofa&mdash;"Precious time I've
had with that little chit of a thing!
Up one street and down another, I've
been racing for this blessed hour!
And the regular white and black 'uns
I've been forced to tell! Oh crickey&mdash;don't
mention 'em, I beg&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sit down, Bess&mdash;sit down, Bessie,
that's a dove&mdash;" said the delighted
old lady, crunching the toast between
her toothless gums&mdash;"and tell us all
about it from the first! These things
are quite refreshin' to us old stagers."</p>

<p>"What a perfect old d&mdash;l&mdash;" muttered
Bessie, as she drew her seat near
the supper table&mdash;"These oysters
are quite delightful&mdash;stewed to a turn,
I <i>do</i> declare&mdash;" she continued, aloud&mdash;"Got
a little drop o' the 'lively'&mdash;hey,
Mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dovey&mdash;here's the key of
the closet. Get the bottle, my dear.
A leetle&mdash;jist a <i>leetle</i>&mdash;don't go ugly
with one's tea&mdash;"</p>

<p>While the tall and queenly Bessie
is engaged in securing a drop of the
lively, we will take a passing glance
at Mother Perkins, the respectable
Lady Abbess of Monk-Hall.</p>

<p>As she sate in that formal arm-chair,
straight and erect, her portly form clad
in sombre black, with a plain white
collar around her neck and a bunch of
keys at her girdle, Mother Nancy
looked, for all the world, like a quiet
old body, whose only delight was to
scatter blessings around her, give
large alms to the poor, and bestow
unlimited amounts of tracts among the
vicious. A good, dear, old body, was
Mother Nancy, although her face was
not decidedly prepossessing. A low
forehead, surmounted by a perfect

<!-- page 66 col 1 -->

tower-of-Babel of a cap, a little sharp
nose looking out from two cheeks disposed
in immense collops of yellowish
flesh, two small grey eyes encircled
by a wilderness of wrinkles, a deep indentation
where a mouth should have
been, and a sharp chin, ornamented
with a slight 'imperial' of stiff grey
beard; such were the details of a
countenance, on which seventy years
had showered their sins, and cares, and
crimes, without making the dear old
lady, for a moment, pause in her career.</p>

<p>And such a career! God of Heaven!
did womanhood, which in its
dawn, or bloom, or full maturity, is so
beautiful, which even in its decline is
lovely, which in trembling old age is
venerable, did womanhood ever sink
so low as this? How many of the
graves in an hundred churchyards,
graves of the fair and beautiful, had
been dug by the gouty hands of the
vile old hag, who sate chuckling in her
quiet arm-chair? How many of the
betrayed maidens, found rotting on the
river's waves, dangling from the garret
rafter, starving in the streets, or resting,
vile and loathsome, in the Green-house;*
how many of these will, at the
last day when the accounts of this
lovely earth will be closed forever,
rise up and curse the old hag with
their ruin, with their shame, with their
unwept death?</p>

<p class="small">[*The house for the unknown dead.]</p>

<p>The details of the old lady's room
by no means indicated her disposition,
or the course of her life. It was a
fine old room with walls neatly papered,

<!-- page 66 col 2 -->

all full of nooks and corners, and
warmed by a cheerful wood fire blazing
on the spacious hearth. One whole
side of the room seemed to have been
attacked with some strange eruptive
disease, and broken out into an erysipelas
of cupboards and closets. An
old desk that might have told a world
of wonders of Noah's Ark from its own
personal experience, could it have
spoken, stood in one corner, and a
large sideboard, on whose top a fat
fellow of a decanter seemed drilling
some raw recruits of bottles and
glasses into military order, occupied
one entire side of the room, or cell, of
the Lady Abbess.</p>

<p>There are few persons in the world
who have not a favorite of some kind,
either a baby, or a parrot, or a canary,
or a cat, or, in desperate cases, a pig.
Mother Nancy had her favorite as
well as less reputable people. A
huge bull-dog, with sore eyes and a
ragged tail&mdash;that seemed to have been
purchased at a second-hand store during
the hard times&mdash;lay nestling at the
old lady's feet, looking very much like
the candidate whom all the old and
surly dogs would choose for Alderman,
in case the canine race had the
privilege of electing an officer of that
honorable class, among themselves.
This dog, so old bachelor-like and
aldermanic in appearance, the old lady
was wont to call by the name of
'Dolph,' being the short for 'Dolphin,'
of which remarkable fish the animal
was supposed to be a decided copy.</p>

<p>"Here's the 'lively,' Mother Nancy&mdash;"
observed Miss Bessie, as she resumed
her seat at the supper table&mdash;"It's
the real hot stuff and <i>no</i> mistake.
The oysters, if you please&mdash;a little o'

<!-- page 67 col 1 -->

that pepper. Any mustard there? Now
then, Mother, let's be comfortable&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But," observed the old lady pouring
a glass of the 'Lively' from a decanter
labelled 'Brandy'&mdash;"But Bessie
my love, I'm a-waitin' to hear all about
this little dove whom you trapped to-night&mdash;"</p>

<p>It may be as well to remark that
Bessie, was a tall queenly girl of some
twenty-five, with a form that had once
been beautiful beyond description, and
even now in its ruins, was lovely to look
upon, while her faded face, marked by
a high brow and raven-black hair,
was still enlivened by the glance of
two large dark eyes, that were susceptible
of any expression, love or hate,
revenge or jealousy; anything but
fear. Her complexion was a very
faint brown with a deep rose-tint on
each cheek. She was still beautiful,
although a long career of dissipation
had given a faded look to the outlines
of her face, indenting a slight wrinkle
between her arching brows, and slightly
discoloring the flesh beneath each
eye.</p>

<p>"This here 'Lively' is first rate,
after the tramp I've had&mdash;" said Bessie
as her eyes grew brighter with the
'lively' effects of the bottle&mdash;"You
know Mother Nancy it's three weeks
since Gus mentioned the <i>thing</i> to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What thing, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Why that he'd like to have a little
dove for himself&mdash;something above the
common run. Something from the aristocracy
of the Quaker City&mdash;you
know?"</p>

<p>"Yes my dear. Here Dolph&mdash;here
Dolph-ee&mdash;here's a nice bit for
Dolph&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gus agreed to give me something

<!-- page 67 col 2 -->

handsome if I could manage it
for him, so I undertook the thing.
The bread if you please, Mother. You
know I'm rather expert in such matters?"</p>

<p>"There ain't you beat my dear.
Be quiet Dolph&mdash;that's a nice Dolph-ee&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For a week all my efforts were in
vain. I couldn't discover anything
that was likely to suit the taste of
Gus&mdash;At last he put me on the right
track himself&mdash;</p>

<p>"He did, did he? Ah deary me, but
Gus is a regular lark. You can't perduce
his ekle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One day strolling up Third Street,
Gus was attracted by the sight of a
pretty girl, sitting at the window of a
wealthy merchant, who has just retired
from business. You've heard of
old Arlington? Try the 'Lively'
Mother. Gus made some enquiries;
found that the young lady had just returned,
from the Moravian boarding
school at Bethlehem. She was innocent,
inexperienced, and all that. Suited
Lorrimer's taste. He swore he'd
have her."</p>

<p>"So you undertook to catch her,
did ye? Butter my dear?"</p>

<p>"That did I. The way I managed
it was a caution. Dressing myself in
solemn black, I strolled along Third
street, one mild winter evening, some
two weeks since. Mary&mdash;that's her
name&mdash;was standing at the front door,
gazing carelessly down the street.
I tripped up the steps and asked in my
most winning tone&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can act the lady when you
like, Bess. That's a fact.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whether Mr. Elmwood lived there?
Of course she answered 'No.' But in
making an apology for my intrusion, I

<!-- page 68 col 1 -->

managed to state that Mr. Elmwood
was my uncle, that I had just come to
the city on a visit, and had left my aunt's
in Spruce Street, but a few moments
ago, thinking to pay a nice little call on
my dear old relative&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just like you Bessie! So you scraped
acquaintance with her?"</p>

<p>"Fresh from boarding school, as
ignorant of the world as the babe unborn,
the girl was interested in me, I
suppose, and swallowed the white 'uns
I told her, without a single suspicion.
The next day about noon, I met her
as she was hurrying to see an old
aunt, who lived two or three Squares
below her father's house. She was all
in a glow, for she had been hurrying
along rather fast, anxious to reach her
aunt's house, as soon as possible. I
spoke to her&mdash;proposed a walk&mdash;she
assented with a smile of pleasure. I
told her a long story of my sorrows;
how I had been engaged to be married,
how my lover had died of consumption
but a month ago; that he was
sich a nice young man, with curly hair,
and hazel eyes, and that I was in black
for his death. I put peach fur over
her eyes, by whole hand's full I tell you.
The girl was interested, and like all
young girls, she was delighted to become
the <i>confidante</i> of an amiable
young lady, who had a little love-romance
of real life, to disclose. Oysters,
Mother Nancy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The long and short of it was, that
you wormed yourself into her confidence?
That it my dear? Keep
still Dolph or Dolph's mommy would
drop little bit of hot tea on Dolph's
head&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We walked out together for three
days, just toward dark in the evening.

<!-- page 68 col 2 -->

You can fancy Mother, how I wound
myself into the heart of this young
girl. Closer and closer every day I
tightened the cords that bound us, and
on the third evening I believe she would
have died for me.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well child, when did Gusty
first speak to her? A little more of
the 'Gunpowder' my dear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One evening I persuaded her to take
a stroll along Chestnut Street with me.
Gus was at our heels you may be sure.
He passed on a little-a-head determining
to speak to her, at all hazards. She
saved him the trouble. Lord love you
Mother Nancy, she spoke to him
first&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be still Dolph&mdash;be still Dolph-ee;
Now Bessie that's a leetle too strong!
Not the tea, but the story. She so innocent
and baby-like speak first to a
strange man? Ask me to believe in
tea made out of turnip tops will ye?&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She mistook him for a Mr. Belmont
whom she had seen at Bethlehem.
He did not undeceive her, until she
was completely in his power. He
walked by her side that evening up
and down Chestnut Street, for nearly
an hour. I saw at once, that her girlish
fancy was caught by his smooth
tongue, and handsome form. The
next night he met us again, and the
next, and the next&mdash;Lord pity her&mdash;the
poor child was <i>now</i> entirely at his
mercy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;Gusty is sich a devil.
Put the kettle on the fire my dear.
Let's try a little of the 'Lively.' And
how did she&mdash;this baby-faced doll&mdash;keep
these walks secret from the eyes
of her folks? Eh? Bessie?"</p>

<p>"Easy as <i>that</i>&mdash;" replied Bessie
gracefully snapping her fingers&mdash;"Every

<!-- page 69 col 1 -->

time she went out, she told
'father and mother' that she went to
see her old Aunt. I hinted at first,
that our friendship would be more romantic,
if concealed from all intrusive
eyes. The girl took the hint. Lorrimer
with his smooth tongue, told her
a long story about his eccentric uncle
who had sworn he should not marry,
for years to come; and therefore he
was obliged to keep his attentions to
her, hidden from both of their families.
Gusty was dependent on this old uncle&mdash;you
know? Once married, the
old uncle would relent as he beheld
the beauty and innocence of the
young&mdash;<i>wife!</i> So Gusty made her
believe. You can imagine the whole
trap. We had her in our power.
Last night she consented to leave her
home for Lorrimer's <i>family</i> mansion.
He was to marry her, the approval of
his uncle&mdash;that imaginary old Gentleman
was to be obtained, and on
Christmas Eve, Mr. and&mdash;ha, ha,
ha&mdash;<i>Mistress</i> Lorrimer, were to rush
into old Middleton's house, fall on their
knees, invoke the old man's blessing;
be forgiven and be happy! Hand us
the toast Mother Nancy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And to-night the girl <i>did</i> leave the
old folks' house? Entered the door
of Monk-Hall, thinking it was Lorrimer's
<i>family</i> Mansion, and to-morrow
morning at three o'clock will be married&mdash;eh?
Bess?"</p>

<p>"Married, pshaw! <i>Over the left.</i>
Lorrimer said he would get that fellow
Petriken to personate the Parson&mdash;Mutchins
the gambler, acts the old uncle;
you, Mother Nancy must, dress
up for the kind and amiable grand-ma&mdash;&mdash;suit
you to a T? Lorrimer
pays high for his rooms you know?"</p>

<!-- page 69 col 2 -->

<p>"S'pose it must be done. It's now
after ten o'clock. You left the baby-face
sleeping, eh? At half-past two
you'll have to rouse her, to dress. Be
quiet Dolph or I'll scald its head&mdash;that's
a dear. Now Bessie tell me
the truth, did you never regret that
you had undertaken the job? The
girl you say is so innocent?"</p>

<p>"Regret?" cried Bess with a flashing
eye&mdash;"Why should I regret?
Have I not as good a right to the comforts
of a home, to the smile of a father,
the love of a mother, as she?
Have I not been robbed of all these?
Of all that is most sacred to woman?
Is this innocent Mary, a whit better
than I <i>was</i> when the devil in human
shape first dragged me from my home?
I feel happy&mdash;aye happy&mdash;when I
can drag another woman, into the same
foul pit, where I am doomed to lie and
rot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yet this thing was <i>so</i> innocent&mdash;"
cried the good old lady patting Dolph
on the head&mdash;"I confess I laugh
at all qualms&mdash;all petty scruples, but
you were so different when first I knew
you&mdash;you <i>Emily</i>, you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Emily</i>&mdash;" shrieked the other as
she sprung suddenly to her feet&mdash;"You
hag of the devil&mdash;call me by
that name again, and as God will judge
at the last day, I'll throttle you!"
She shook her clenched hand across
the table, and her eyes were bloodshot
with sudden rage&mdash;" '<i>Emily!</i>'
Your mother called you by that name
when a little child&mdash;" She cried with
a burst of feeling, most fearful to behold
in one so fallen&mdash;"Your father
blessed you by that name, the
night before you fled from his roof!</p>

<p>" 'Emily!' Aye, <i>he</i>, the foul betrayer,

<!-- page 70 col 1 -->

whispered that name with a smile
as he entered the Chamber, from which
he never came forth again&mdash;You remember
it old hell-cat, do ye?&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not so loud, Good G&mdash;d, not so
loud&mdash;" cried the astonished Mother
Nancy&mdash;"Abuse me Bessie
dear&mdash;but not so loud; down Dolph
don't mind the girl, she's mad&mdash;not
so loud, I say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can see him now!" cried the
fallen girl, as with her tall form raised
to its full height, she fixed her flashing
eye on vacancy&mdash;"He enters the room&mdash;that
room with the&mdash;the trap-door
you know? 'Good night, Emily,' he
said, and smiled&mdash;'Emily?' and&mdash;my
father had cursed him! I laid me
down and rested by another man's
side. <i>He</i> thought I slept. Slept! ha,
ha! When, with my entire soul, I
listened to the footsteps in the next
room&mdash;ha, ha&mdash;when I heard the
creaking sound of the falling trap,
when I drank in the cry of agony,
when I heard that name 'Emily, oh
Emily,' come shrieking up the pit of
death! My father had cursed him,
and he died! 'Emily'&mdash; oh my God&mdash;"
and she wrung her hands in very agony&mdash;"Roll
back the years of my life,
blot out the foul record of my sins, let
me, oh God&mdash;you are all powerful
and can do it&mdash;let me be a child
again, a little child, and though I
crawl through life in the rags of a
beggar, I will never cease to bless&mdash;oh
God&mdash;to bless your name&mdash;"</p>

<p>She fell heavily to her seat, and,
covering her face with her hands, wept
the scalding tears of guilt and shame.</p>

<p>" 'Gal's been a-takin' opium&mdash;"
said the old lady, calmly&mdash;"And the
fit's come on her. 'Serves her right.

<!-- page 70 col 2 -->

'Told her never to mix her brandy
with opium&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did I regret having undertaken
the ruin of the girl&mdash;" said Bess, in a
whisper, that made even the old lady
start with surprise&mdash;"Regret? I tell
ye, old hell-dame as you are, that my
very heart strings seemed breaking
within me to-night, as I led her from
her home&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What the d&mdash;l did you do it for,
then? Here's a nice Dolph&mdash;eat a
piece o' buttered toast&mdash;that's a good
Dolph-ee&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When the seducer first assailed
me&mdash;" continued Bess, in an absent
tone&mdash;"He assailed a woman, with a
mind stored with knowledge of the
world's ways, a soul full as crafty as
his own, a wit sharp and keen as ever
dropped poison or sweetness from a
woman's tongue! But this girl, so
child-like, so unsuspecting, so innocent!
my God! how it wrung my
heart, when I first discovered that she
<i>loved</i> Lorrimer, loved him without one
shade of gross feeling, loved him without
a doubt, warmly, devotedly, with
all the trustfulness of an angel-soul,
fresh from the hands of God! Never
a bird fell more helplessly into the
yawning jaws of the snake, that had
charmed it to ruin, than poor Mary
fell into the accursed wiles of Lorrimer!
And yet <i>I, I</i> aided him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So you did. The more shame for
you to harm sich a dove. Go up stairs,
my dear, and let her loose. We'll
consent, won't we? Ha-ha! Why
Bess, I thought you had more sense
than to go on this way. What <i>will</i>
become of you?"</p>

<p>"I suppose that I will die in the
same ditch where the souls of so many

<!-- page 71 col 1 -->

of my vile sisterhood have crept forth
from their leprous bodies? Eh, Mother
Nance? Die in a ditch? '<i>Emily</i>' die
in a ditch? And then in the next
world&mdash;ha, ha, ha&mdash;I see a big lake
of fire, on which souls are dancing
like moths in a candle&mdash;ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"Reely, gal, you must leave off
that opium. Gus promised you some
five or six hundred if you caught this
gal, and you can't go back now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know it! I know it!
<i>Forward's</i> the word if the next step
plunges me in hell&mdash;"</p>

<p>And the girl buried her face in her
hands, and was silent again. Let not
the reader wonder at the mass of contradictions,
heaped together in the
character of this miserable wreck of a
woman. One moment conversing in
the slang of a brothel, like a thing
lapped from her birth in pollution; the
next, whispering forth her ravings in
language indicative of the educated
woman of her purer days; one instant
glorying in her shame, the next recoiling
in horror as she viewed the dark
path which she had trodden, the
darker path which she was yet to
tread&mdash;these paradoxes are things of
every day occurrence, only to be explained,
when the mass of good and
evil, found in every human heart, is
divided into distinct parts, no more to
mingle in one, no more to occasion an
eternal contest in the self-warring
heart of man.</p>

<p>"Well, well, Bessie&mdash;go to bed
and sleep a little&mdash;that's a dear&mdash;"
said the old lady, with a pleasing
smile&mdash;"Opium isn't good for you,
and you know it. A leetle nap 'll do
you good. Sleep a bit, and then you'll
be right fresh for the wedding. Three

<!-- page 71 col 2 -->

o'clock you know&mdash;Come along,
Dolph, mommy must go 'tend to some

<p class="small">A CHAPTER IN WHICH EVERY WOMAN MAY FIND
SOME LEAVES OF HER OWN HEART, READ WITH
THE EYES OF A HIGH AND HOLY LOVE.</p>

</div>

<p>"MARY!"</p>

<p>Oh sweetest name of woman! name
by which some of us may hail a wife,
or a sister in heaven; name so soft, and
rippling, and musical; name of the
mother of Jesus, made holy by poetry
and religion!&mdash;how foully were you
profaned by the lips that whispered
your sound of gentleness in the sleeper's
ear!</p>

<p>"Mary!"</p>

<p>The fair girl stirred in her sleep,
and her lips dropped gently apart as
she whispered a single word&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lorraine!"</p>

<p>"The assumed name of Lorrimer&mdash;"
exclaimed the woman, who stood
by the bedside&mdash;"Gus has some taste,
even in his vilest loves! But, with
this girl&mdash;this child&mdash;good Heavens!
how refined! He shrunk at the very
idea of <i>her</i> voice whispering the name
which had been shouted by his devil-mates
at a drinking bout! So he told
the girl to call him&mdash;not Gusty, no,
no, but something musical&mdash;<i>Lorraine!</i>"</p>

<p>And, stooping over the couch,
the queenly woman, with her proud

<!-- page 72 col 1 -->

form arrayed in a dress of snow
white silk, and her raven-black hair
gathered in thick tresses along her
neck, so full and round, applied her
lips to the ear of the sleeper and
whispered in a softened tone&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mary! Awake&mdash;it is your wedding
night!"</p>

<p>The room was still as death. Not
a sound save the faint breathing of the
sleeper; all hushed and still. The
light of the wax candle standing on
the table in the centre of the Rose
Chamber&mdash;as it was called&mdash;fell
mild and softened over the hangings
of faint crimson, with the effect of
evening twilight.</p>

<p>The maiden&mdash;pure and without
stain&mdash;lay sleeping on the small
couch that occupied one corner of the
closet. Her fair limbs were enshrouded
in the light folds of a night-robe,
and she lay in an attitude of perfect
repose, one glowing cheek resting
upon her uncovered arm, while over
the other, waved the loosened curls
of her glossy hair. The parting lips
disclosed her teeth, white as ivory,
while her youthful bosom came heaving
up from the folds of her night-robe,
like a billow that trembles for a
moment in the moonlight, and then is
suddenly lost to view. She lay there
in all the ripening beauty of maidenhood,
the light falling gently over her
young limbs, their outlines marked by
the easy folds of her robe, resembling
in their roundness and richness of proportion,
the swelling fulness of the
rose-bud that needs but another beam
of light, to open it into its perfect
bloom.</p>

<p>The arching eyebrows, the closed

<!-- page 72 col 2 -->

lids, with the long lashes resting on
the cheek, the parted lips, and the
round chin, with its smiling dimple,
all these were beautiful, but oh how
fair and beautiful the maiden's dreams!
Rosier than her cheek, sweeter than
her breath, lovelier than her kiss&mdash;lovely
as her own stainless soul, on
whose leaves was written but one
motto of simple meaning&mdash;"<i>Love in
life, in death, and for ever</i>."</p>

<p>And in all her dreams she beheld
but one form, heard the whisper of
but one voice, shared the sympathies
of but one heart! <i>He</i> was her dream,
her life, her <i>God</i>&mdash;him had she trusted
with her all, in earth or heaven,
him did she love with the uncalculating
abandonment of self, that marks
the first passion of an innocent woman!</p>

<p class="small">[*The reader who desires to understand
thoroughly, the pure love of an innocent girl
for a corrupt libertine, will not fail to peruse
this passage.]</p>

<p>*And was there aught of <i>earth</i> in
this love? Did the fever of sensual
passion throb in the pulses of her virgin
blood? Did she love Lorimer because
his eye was bright, his form
magnificent, his countenance full of
healthy manliness? No, no, no!
Shame on the fools of either sex, who
read the first love of a stainless woman,
with the eyes of Sense. She
loved Lorrimer for a something which
he did not possess, which vile worldlings
of his class never will possess.
For the magic with which her fancy
had enshrouded his face and form, she
loved him, for the wierd fascination
which <i>her own soul</i> had flung around
his very existence, for a dream of

<!-- page 73 col 1 -->

which <i>he</i> was the idol, for a waking
trance in which <i>he</i> walked as her
good Angel, for imagination, for fancy,
for anything but <i>sense</i>, she loved
him.</p>

<p>It was her first love.</p>

<p>She knew not that this fluttering
fascination, which bound her to his
slightest look or tone&mdash;like the
charmed bird to the lulling music
which the snake is said to murmur,
as he ensnares his prey&mdash;she knew
not that this fluttering fascination, was
but the blind admiration of the moth,
as it floats in the light of the flame,
which will at last consume it.</p>

<p>She knew not that in her own organization,
were hidden the sympathies
of an animal as well as of an
intellectual nature, that the blood in
her veins only waited an opportunity
to betray her, that in the very atmosphere
of the holiest love of woman,
crouched a sleeping fiend, who at the
first whisperings of her Wronger,
would arise with hot breath and blood-shot
eyes, to wreak eternal ruin on her
woman's-honor.</p>

<p>For this is the doctrine we deem it
right to hold in regard to woman.
Like man she is a combination of an
animal, with an intellectual nature.
Unlike man her animal nature is a
<i>passive</i> thing, that must be roused ere
it will develope itself in action. Let
the intellectual nature of woman, be
the only object of man's influence, and
woman will love him most holily.
But let him play with her animal nature
as you would toy with the machinery
of a watch, let him rouse the
treacherous blood, let him fan the
pulse into quick, feverish throbbings,
let him warm the heart with convulsive

<!-- page 73 col 2 -->

beatings, and the woman becomes,
like himself, but a mere animal.
<i>Sense</i> rises like a vapor, and utterly
darkens <i>Soul</i>.</p>

<p>And shall we heap shame on woman,
because man, neglecting her holiest
nature, may devote all the energies
which God has given him, to rouse
her gross and earthy powers into action?
On whose head is the shame,
or whose the wrong? Oh, would man
but learn the solemn truth&mdash;that no
angel around God's throne is purer
than Woman when her intellectual nature
alone is stirred into development,
that no devil crouching in the flames
of hell is fouler than Woman, when
her animal nature alone is roused into
action&mdash;would man but learn and revere
this fearful truth, would woman
but treasure it in her inmost soul, then
would never a shriek arise to heaven,
heaping curses on the betrayer's head,
then would never a wrong done to
maiden virtue, give the suicide's grave
its victim, then in truth, would woman
walk the earth, the spirit of light that
the holiest Lover ever deemed her!</p>

<p>And the maiden lay dreaming of
her lover, while the form of the tall
and stately woman, stood by the bedside,
like her Evil Angel, as with a
mingled smile and sneer, she bade the
girl arise, for it was her wedding night.
<i>Her wedding night!</i></p>

<p>"Mary! Awake&mdash;it is your wedding
night!"</p>

<p>Mary murmured in her sleep, and
then opened her large blue eyes, and
arose in the couch.</p>

<p>"Has&mdash;<i>he</i> come?" were the first
words she murmured in her musical
tones, that came low and softened to
the listener's ear&mdash;"Has <i>he</i> come?"</p>

<!-- page 74 col 1 -->

<p>"Not yet&mdash;not yet&mdash;my dear&mdash;"
said long-haired Bess, assisting the
young maiden to rise from the couch,
with all imaginable tenderness of manner&mdash;"You
see Mary love, it's
half-past two o'clock and over, and
of course, high time for you to dress.
Throw back your night-gown my love,
and let me arrange your hair. How
soft and silky&mdash;it needs but little aid
from my hands, to render each tress
a perfect charm&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is it not very strange Bessie&mdash;"
said Mary opening her large blue eyes
with a bewildered glance as she spoke.</p>

<p>"What is strange? I see nothing
strange except the remarkable beauty
of these curls&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I should first meet him, in
such a singular manner, that he should
love me, that for his sake I should fly
to his uncle's mansion and that you
Bessie&mdash;my dear good friend&mdash;should
consent from mere friendship to leave
your home and bear me company.
All this is very strange&mdash;how like
the stories we read in a book! And
his stern old uncle you say has relented?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly resigned to the match
my dear. That's the way with all
these relations&mdash;is not that curl perfect?&mdash;when
they've made all the mischief
they can, and find it amounts to
nothing, at the last moment they roll
up their eyes, and declare with a
sigh&mdash;that they're <i>resigned</i> to the
match. And his dear old grand-ma&mdash;She
lives here you know? There
that is right&mdash;your curls should fall
in a shower over your snow-white
neck&mdash;The dear old lady is in a perfect
fever to see you! She helped me

<!-- page 74 col 2 -->

to get everything ready for the wedding&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh Bessie&mdash;Is it not most sad?"
said Mary as her blue eyes shone with
a glance of deep feeling&mdash;"To think
that Albert and you should love one
another, so fondly, and after all, that
he should die, leaving you alone in this
cheerless world! How terrible! <i>If</i>
Lorraine should die&mdash;"</p>

<p>A deep shade of feeling passed over
Mary's face, and her lip trembled.
Bessie held her head down, for a moment,
as her fair fingers, ran twining
among the tresses of the Bride. Was
it to conceal a tear, or a&mdash;smile?</p>

<p>"Alas! <i>He</i> is in his grave! Yet
it is the <i>memory</i> of his love, that makes
me take such a warm interest in your
union with Lorraine. This plain fillet
of silver, with its diamond star&mdash;how
well it becomes your brow!
You never yet found a woman, who
knew what it was to love, that would
not fight for two true-hearted lovers,
against the world! Do you think
Mary dear, that I could have sanctioned
your flight to this house, if my
very soul had not been interested in
your happiness? Not I&mdash;not I!
Now slip off your night-gown my
dear&mdash;Have you seen the wedding
dress?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me&mdash;" said Mary,
whose thoughts dwelt solely on her
love for Lorrimer&mdash;"That there is
something deeply touching in a wedding
that is held at this hour of the
night! Everything is calm and tranquil;
the earth lies sleeping, while
Heaven itself watches over the union
of two hearts that are all in all to
each other&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 75 col 1 -->

<p>The words look plain and simple,
but the tone in which she spoke was
one of the deepest feeling. Her very
soul was in her words. Her blue eyes
dilated with a sudden enthusiasm, and
the color went and came along her
glowing cheek, until it resembled a
fair flower, one moment resting in the
shade, the next bathing in the sunlight.</p>

<p>"Let me assist you to put on this
wedding dress. Is it not beautiful?
That boddice of white silk was Lorrimer's
taste. To be sure I gave the
dress-maker a few hints. Is it not perfect?
How gently the folds of the
skirt rest on your figure! It is a perfect
fit, I do declare! Why Mary
you are <i>too</i> beautiful! Well, well,
handsome as he is, Lorrimer ought to
be half crazy with vanity, when such
a Bride is hanging on his arm!"</p>

<p>A few moments sufficed to array
the maiden for the bridal.&mdash;</p>

<p>Mary stood erect on the floor, blush
after blush coursing over her cheek,
as she surveyed the folds of her gorgeous
wedding dress.</p>

<p>It was in truth a dress most worthy
of her face and form. From the shoulders
to the waist her figure was enveloped
in a boddice of snow-white
satin, that gathered over her swelling
bosom, with such gracefulness of shape
that every beauty of her form,&mdash;the
width of the shoulders, and the gradual
falling off, of the outline of the
waist, was clearly perceptible.</p>

<p>Fitting closely around the bust,
it gave to view her fair round neck,
half-concealed by the drooping curls of
glossy hair, and a glimpse of each shoulder,
so delicate and white, swelling
away into the fullness of the virgin
bosom, that rose heaving above the

<!-- page 75 col 2 -->

border of lace. From the waist downward,
in many a fold, but with perfect
adaptation to her form, the gorgeous
skirt of satin, fell sweeping to
the floor, leaving one small and tiny
foot, enclosed in a neat slipper, that
clung to it as though it had grown
there, exposed to the eye.</p>

<p>The softened light falling over the
rose-hued hangings of the room,
threw the figure of the maiden out
from the dim background, in gentle
and effective prominence. Her
brown tresses showering down over
each cheek, and falling along her
neck and shoulders, waved gently to
and fro, and caught a glossy richness
from the light. Her fair shoulders,
her full bosom, her long but not too
slender waist, the downward proportions
of her figure, swelling with the
full outlines of ripening maidenhood;
all arrayed in the graceful dress of
snow-white satin, stood out in the dim
light, relieved most effectively by the
rose-hued hangings, in the background.</p>

<p>As yet her arms, unhidden by sleeve
or robe, gave their clear, transparent
skin, their fullness of outline, their
perfect loveliness of shape, all freely
to the light.</p>

<p>"Is it not a gorgeous dress?" said
long-haired Bess, as she gazed with
unfeigned admiration upon the face
and form of the beautiful maiden&mdash;"As
gorgeous, dear Mary, as you are
beautiful!"</p>

<p>"Oh it will be such a happy time!"
cried Mary, in a tone that scarcely
rose above a whisper, while her blue
eyes flashed with a glance of deep
emotion&mdash;"There will sit my father
and there my mother, in the cheerful

<!-- page 76 col 1 -->

parlor on Christmas Eve! My father's
grey hairs and my mother's kindly
face, will be lighted up by the same
glow of light. And their eyes will be
heavy with tears&mdash;with weeping for
me, Bessie, their 'lost child,' as they
will call me. When behold! the door
opens, Lorraine enters with me, his
wife, yes, yes <i>his wife</i> by his side.
We fling ourselves at the feet of our
father and mother for they will be
<i>ours</i>, then! We crave their forgiveness!
Lorraine calls me his wife&mdash;we
beg their forgiveness and their
blessing in the same breath! Oh it
will be such a happy time! And my
brother he will be there too&mdash;<i>he</i> will
like Lorraine, for he has a noble
heart! Don't you see the picture,
Bessie? I see it as plainly as though
it was this moment before me, and&mdash;my
father&mdash;oh how he will weep
when again he clasps his daughter in
his arms!"</p>

<p>There she stood, her fair hands
clasped trembling together, her eyes
flashing in ecstacy, while her heart,
throbbing and throbbing like some
wild bird, endeavoring to burst the bars
of its cage, sent her bosom heaving
into view.</p>

<p>Bessie made no reply. True she
attempted some common-place phrase,
but the words died in her throat. She
turned her head away, and&mdash;thank
God, she was not <i>yet</i> fallen to the
lowest deep of woman's degradation&mdash;a
tear, big and scalding, came rolling
down her cheek.</p>

<p>And while Mary stood with her
eyes gazing on the vacant air, with
the manner of one entranced, while
Bess&mdash;poor and fallen woman!&mdash;turned

<!-- page 76 col 2 -->

away her face to hide the falling
tear, the curtains that concealed
the entrance to the Painted Chamber
were suddenly thrust aside, and the
figure of a man came stealing along
with a noiseless footstep.</p>

<p>Gus Lorrimer, silent and unperceived,
in all the splendor of his
manly beauty, stood gazing upon the
form of his victim, with a glance of
deep and soul-felt admiration.</p>

<p>His tall form was shown to the utmost
advantage, by a plain suit of
black cloth. A dress coat of the most
exquisite shape, black pantaloons that
fitted neatly around his well-formed
limbs, a vest of plain white Marseilles,
gathering easily across the outlines of
his massive chest, a snow-white shirt
front, and a falling collar, confined by
a simple black cravat; such were the
brief details of his neat but effective
costume. His manly face was all in
a glow with health and excitement.
Clustering curls of dark brow hair
fell carelessly along his open brow.
His clear, dark-hazel eye, gave forth
a flashing glance, that failed to reveal
anything but the frank and manly
qualities of a generous heart. You
did not read the villain, in his glance.
The aquiline nose, the rounded chin,
the curving lip, darkened by a graceful
moustache, the arching eyebrows,
which gave additional effect to the
dark eyes; all formed the details of a
countenance that ever struck the beholder
with its beaming expression of
health, soul, and manliness, combined.</p>

<p>And as Gus Lorrimer stood gazing
in silent admiration upon his victim,
few of his boon companions would
have recognized, in his thoughtful

<!-- page 77 col 1 -->

countenance, the careless though handsome
face of the reveller, who gave life
and spirit to their drinking scenes.</p>

<p>The truth is, there were <i>two</i> Lorrimers
in <i>one</i>. There was a careless,
dashing, handsome fellow who could
kill a basket of champagne with any
body, drive the neatest 'turn out' in
the way of horse flesh that the town
ever saw, carry a 'frolic' so far that
the watchman would feel bound to
take it up and carry it a little farther&mdash;This
was the magnificent Gus Lorrimer.</p>

<p>And then there was a tall, handsome
man, with a thoughtful countenance,
and a deep, dark hazel eye,
who would sit down by the side of an
innocent woman, and whisper in her
ear, in a low-toned voice for hours together,
with an earnestness of manner
and an intensity of gaze, that failed
in its effect, not once in a hundred
times. Without any remarkable
knowledge derived from education,
this man knew every leaf of woman's
many-leaved heart, and knew how
to apply the revealings, which the fair
book opened to his gaze. His gaze,
in some cases, in itself was fascination;
his low-toned voice, in too many
instances, whispered its sentences of
passion to ears, that heard it to their
eternal sorrow. This man threw his
whole soul, in his every passion. He
plead with a woman, like a man under
sentence of death pleading for his life.
Is it a wonder that he was but rarely
unsuccessful? This man, so deeply
read in woman's heart, was the 'inner
man' of the handsome fellow, with the
dashing exterior. Assuming a name,
never spoken to his ear, save in the

<!-- page 77 col 2 -->

soft whispers of one of his many
victims, he styled himself Lorraine
Lorrimer.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bessie, is not this Love&mdash;a
strange mystery?" exclaimed
Mary, as though communing with her
own heart&mdash;"Before I loved, my soul
was calm and quiet. I had no thought
beyond my school-books&mdash;no deeper
mystery than my embroidery-frame.
<i>Now</i>&mdash;the very air is changed. The
atmosphere in which I breathe is no
longer the same. Wherever I move
<i>his</i> face is before me. Whatever may
be my thoughts, the thought of <i>him</i> is
never absent for a moment. In my
dreams I see him smile. When
awake, his eyes, so deep, so burning
in their gaze&mdash;even when he is absent&mdash;seem
forever looking into mine.
Oh, Bessie&mdash;tell me, tell me&mdash;is it
given to man to adore his God? Is it
not also given to woman to adore the
<i>one</i> she loves? Woman's <i>religion</i> is
her <i>love</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>And as the beautiful enthusiast,
<i>whose mind had been developed in
utter seclusion from the world</i>, gave
forth these revelations of her heart, in
broken and abrupt sentences, Lorrimer
drew a step nearer, and gazed
upon her with a look in which passion
rose predominant, even above admiration.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bessie, can it be that his love
will ever grow cold? Will his voice
ever lose its tones of gentleness, will
his gaze ever cease to bind me to him,
as it enchains me now?"</p>

<p>"Mary!" whispered a strange voice
in a low and softened murmur.</p>

<p>She turned hastily round, she beheld
the arms outspread to receive her, she

<!-- page 78 col 1 -->

saw the manly face of him she loved
all a-glow with rapture, her fair blue
eyes returned his gaze, "Lorraine,"
she murmured, in a faint whisper, and
then her head rested upon his bosom,
while her form trembled in his embrace.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lorraine&mdash;" she again murmured,
as, with one fair hand resting
upon each arm of her lover, she gazed
upward in his face, while her blue eyes
shone with all the feeling of her inmost
soul. "Oh&mdash;Lorraine&mdash;will
you love me ever?"</p>

<p>"Mary&mdash;" he answered, gazing
down upon her blushing face, as he
uttered her name in a prolonged whisper,
that gave all its melody of sound to
her ear&mdash;"Mary can you doubt me?"</p>

<p>And as there he stood gazing upon
that youthful face, now flushed over
with an expression of all-trusting love,
as he drank in the glance of her large
blue eyes, and felt her trembling form
resting gently in his arms, the foul
purpose of his heart was, for a moment,
forgotten, for a moment his
heart rose swelling within him, and
the thought flashed over his soul, that
for the fair creature, who hung fascinated
on his every look, his life he
could willingly lay down.</p>

<p>"Ha-ha&mdash;" muttered Bess, who
stood regarding the pair with a glance
of doubtful meaning&mdash;"I really believe
that Lorrimer is quite as much
in love, as the poor child! Good idea,
that! A man, whose heart has been
the highway of a thousand loves&mdash;a
man like this, to fall in love with a
mere baby-face! Mary, dear&mdash;" she
continued aloud, too happy to break
the reverie which enchained the seducer
and his victim&mdash;"Mary, dear,

<!-- page 78 col 2 -->

hadn't I better help you to put on your
wedding robe?"</p>

<p>Lorrimer turned and looked at her
with a sudden scowl of anger. In a
moment his face resumed its smile&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mary&mdash;" he cried, laughingly&mdash;"let
me be your costumer, for once.
My hands must help you on with the
wedding robe. Nay, nay, you must
not deny me. Hand me the dress,
Bessie&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was a splendid robe of the same
satin, as the other part of her dress.
Gathering tightly around her form, it
was designed to remain open in front,
while the skirt fell trailing along the
floor. Falling aside from the bust,
where outlines were so gracefully developed
by the tight-fitting boddice of
white satin, its opposite sides were connected
by interlacing threads of silver-cord,
crossed and recrossed over the
heaving bosom. Long and drooping
sleeves, edged with silver lace, were
designed to give bewitching glimpses
of the maiden's full and rounded arms.
In fine, the whole dress was in the
style of some sixty years since, such
as our grand-dames designated by the
euphonious name of "a gown and
curricle."</p>

<p>"How well the dress becomes you
Mary!" exclaimed Lorrimer with
a smile as he flung the robe over her
shoulders&mdash;"How elegant the fall
of that sleeve! Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;Mary,
you <i>must</i> allow me to lace these silver
cords in front. I'm afraid I would
make but an awkward lady's-maid.
What say you Bessie? Mary, your
arms seem to love the light embrace
of these drooping sleeves. You must
forgive me, Mary, but I thought the
style of the dress would please you,

<!-- page 79 col 1 -->

so I asked our good friend Bessie here
to have it made. By my soul, you
give additional beauty to the wedding
dress. Is she not beautiful Bessie?"</p>

<p>"Most beautiful&mdash;" exclaimed
Bess, as for the moment, her gaze of
unfeigned admiration was fixed upon
the Bride, arrayed in the full splendor
of her wedding robes&mdash;"Most
beautiful!"</p>

<p>"Mary, your hand&mdash;" whispered
Lorrimer to the fair girl, who stood
blushing at his side.</p>

<p>With a heaving bosom, and a flashing
eye, Mary slowly reached forth
her fair and delicate right hand.
Lorrimer grasped the trembling fingers
within his own, and winding his
unoccupied arm around her waist he
suffered her head, with all its shower
of glossy tresses, to fall gently on his
shoulders. A blush, warm and sudden,
came over her face. He impressed
one long and lingering kiss upon
her lips. They returned the pressure,
and clung to his lips as though they
had grown there.</p>

<p>"Mary, my own sweet love&mdash;" he
murmured in a low tone, that thrilled
to her very heart&mdash;"Now I kiss you
as the dearest thing to me in the wide
world. Another moment, and from
those same lips will I snatch the first
kiss of my lovely bride! To the
Wedding Room my love!"</p>

<p>Fair and blushing as the dawn,
stainless as the new-fallen snow, loving
as one of God's own cherubim, he
led her gently from the place, motioning
onward with his hand as again
and again he whispered "To the Wedding
Room my love, to the Wedding
Room!"</p>

<p>"To the Wedding Room&mdash;" echoed

<!-- page 79 col 2 -->

Bess who followed in her Bridesmaid
robes&mdash;"To the Wedding
Room&mdash;ha, ha, ha, say rather to
h&mdash;ll!"</p>

<p>There was something most solemn,
not to say thoughtful and melancholy,
in the appearance of that lonely room.
It was wide and spacious, and warmed
by invisible means, with heated air.
Huge panels of wainscotting covered
the lofty walls, and even the ceiling
was concealed by massive slabs of
dark walnut. The floor was all one
polished surface of mahogany, destitute
of carpet or covering of any kind.
A few high-backed mahogany chairs,
standing along the walls, were the only
furniture of the place. The entrance
to the Rose Chamber, was concealed
by a dark curtain, and in the western,
and northern walls, were fashioned
two massive doors, formed like the
wainscotting, of dark and gloomy
walnut.</p>

<p>In the centre of the glittering mahogany
floor, arose a small table or
altar, covered with a drooping cloth,
white and stainless as the driven snow.
Two massive wax candles, placed in
candlesticks of silver, stood on the
white cloth of the altar, imparting a
dim and dusky light to the room. In
that dim light the sombre panelling of
the walls and the ceiling, the burnished
floor of mahogany as dark as the
walnut-wood that concealed the ceiling
and the walls, looked heavy and
gloomy, as though the place was a
vault of death, instead of a cheerful
Wedding Room.</p>

<p>As yet the place was silent and solitary.
The light flickered dimly
along the walls, and over the mahogany

<!-- page 80 col 1 -->

floor, which shone like a rippling
lake in the moonlight. As you gazed
upon the desolate appearance of that
place, with the solitary wax lights
burning like two watching souls, in
the centre, you would have given the
world, to have seen the room tenanted
by living beings; in its present stillness
and solitude, it looked so much
like, one of those chambers in olden
story, where the ghosts of a departed
family, were wont to assemble once
a year, in order to revive the memories
of their lives on earth.</p>

<p>It might have been three o'clock,
or even half an hour later, when the
western door swung slowly open, and
the Clergyman, who was to solemnize
this marriage, came striding somewhat
unsteadily along the floor. Clad
in robes of flowing white&mdash;he had
borrowed them from the Theatre&mdash;with
a Prayer Book in his hand, Petriken
as he glanced uneasily around
the room, did not look at all unlike
a Minister of a particular class. His
long, square, lugubrious face, slightly
varied by red streaks around each
eye, was tortured into an expression
of the deepest solemnity. He took
his position in silence, near the Altar.</p>

<p>Then came the relenting Uncle,
striding heavily at the parson's heels&mdash;He
was clad in a light blue coat
with metal buttons, a buff vest, striped
trowsers, and an enormous scarf,
whose mingled colors of blue and gold,
gathered closely around his short fat
neck. His full-moon face&mdash;looking
very much like the face of a relenting
uncle, who is willing to bestow
mercy upon a wild young dog of a
nephew, to almost any extent&mdash;afforded
a pleasing relief to his pear-shaped

<!-- page 80 col 2 -->

nose, which stood out in the light, like
a piece of carved work from a crimson
wall. Silently the relenting Uncle,
took his position beside the venerable
Clergyman.</p>

<p>Then dressed in solemn black, the
respected Grand-ma of the Bridegroom,
who was in <i>such</i> a fever to see the
Bride, came stepping mincingly along
the floor, glancing from side to side
with an amiable look that ruffled the
yellowish flesh of her colloped cheeks.</p>

<p>The 'imperial' on her chin had been
softened down, and with the aid of a
glossy dress of black silk, and a tower-of-Babel
cap, she looked quite venerable.
Had it not been for a certain
twinkle in her eyes, you could have
fallen in her arms and kissed her;
she looked so much like one of those
dear old souls, who make mischief in
families and distribute tracts and cold
victuals to the poor. The Grand-ma
took her position on the left of the
Clergyman.</p>

<p>And in this position, gathered around
the Altar, they stood for some five
minutes silently awaiting the appearance
of the Bridegroom and the Bride.</p>

<p>CHAPTER TENTH.</p>

<p class="small">THE BRIDAL.</p>

</div>

<p>"I SAY Mutchy, my boy&mdash;" said
Petriken, in a tone that indicated
some lingering effects of his late debauch&mdash;"How
<i>do</i> I do it? Clever&mdash;hey?
D'ye like this face? <i>Good</i>&mdash;is
it? If my magazine fails, I
think I'll enter the ministry for good.
Why not start a Church of my own?

<!-- page 81 col 1 -->

When a man's fit for nothin' else, he
can always find fools enough to build
him a church, and glorify him into a
saint&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you think I <i>do</i> the Uncle
well?" whispered Mutchins, drawing
his shirt collar up from the depths of
his scarf, into which it had fallen&mdash;"Devilish
lucky you gave me the hint
in time. 'Been the d&mdash;l to pay if we'd
a-disappointed Gus. What am I to
say, Silly. 'Is <i>she</i> not <i>beautiful!</i> in a
sort of an <i>aside</i> tone, and then fall on
her neck and kiss her? Eh, Silly?"</p>

<p>"That'll be coming it a little too
strong&mdash;" said Petriken, smoothing
back his tow-colored hair&mdash;"You're
merely to take her by the finger-tips,
and start as if her beauty overcame
you, then exclaim 'God bless you my
love, God bless you&mdash;' as though
your feelings were too strong for utterance&mdash;"</p>

<p>" 'God bless you, my love&mdash;' "
echoed Mutchins&mdash;" 'God bless you'&mdash;that
will do&mdash;hey, Silly? I feel
quite an interest in her already. Now
Aunty, my dear and kind-hearted old
relative, what in the d&mdash;l are <i>you</i> to
do?"</p>

<p>"Maybe I'll get up a convulsion or
two&mdash;" said the dear old lady, as her
colloped cheeks waggled heavily with a
smile&mdash;her enemies would have called
it a hideous grin&mdash;"Maybe I'll do a
hysteric or so. Maybe I won't? Dear
me, I'm in sich a fever to see my little
pet of a grand-daughter! Ain't I?"</p>

<p>"Hist!" whispered Petriken&mdash;"There
they are in the next room.
I think I heard a kiss. Hush! Here
they come&mdash;d&mdash;n it, I can't find the
marriage ceremony&mdash;"</p>

<p>No sooner had the words passed his

<!-- page 81 col 2 -->

lips, than Lorrimer appeared in the
small doorway opening into the Rose
Chamber, and stepped softly along
the floor of the Walnut Room. Mary
in all her beauty hung on his arm.
Her robe of satin wound round her
limbs, and trailed along the floor as
she walked. At her side came Long-haired
Bess, glancing in the faces of
the wedding guests with a meaning
smile.</p>

<p>"Nephew, I forgive you. God
bless you, my dear&mdash;I approve my
nephew's choice&mdash;God bless you, my
dear&mdash;"</p>

<p>And, as though his feelings overcame
him, Mutchins veiled his face in
a large red handkerchief; beneath
whose capacious shelter he covertly
supplied his mouth with a fresh morsel
of tobacco.</p>

<p>"And is <i>this</i> my grandchild? Is
this the dear pet? How I shall love
her! Shan't I, grandson? Oh my
precious, how do you <i>do?</i>"</p>

<p>The clergyman saluted the bride
with a low bow.</p>

<p>A deep blush came mantling over
Mary's face as she received these
words of affection and tokens of kindness
from the Minister and the relatives
of her husband, while a slight,
yet meaning, expression of disgust
flashed over Lorrimer's features, as he
observed the manner in which his
minions and panders performed their
parts.</p>

<p>With a glance of fire, Lorrimer
motioned the clergyman to proceed
with the ceremony.</p>

<p>This was the manner of the marriage.</p>

<p>Hand joined in hand, Lorrimer and
Mary stood before the altar. The

<!-- page 82 col 1 -->

bridesmaid stood near the trembling
bride, whispering slight sentences of
consolation in her ear. On the right
hand of the clergyman, stood Mutchins,
his red round face, subdued into
an expression of the deepest solemnity;
on the other side, the vile hag
of Monk-Hall, with folded arms, and
grinning lips, calmly surveyed the
face of the fair young bride.</p>

<p>In a deep-toned voice, Petriken began
the sublime marriage ceremony
of the Protestant Episcopal Church.
There was no hope for the bride now.
Trapped, decoyed, betrayed, she was
about to be offered up, a terrible sacrifice,
on that unhallowed altar. Her
trembling tones, joined with the deep
voice of Lorrimer in every response,
and the marriage ceremony, drew
near its completion. "There is no
hope for her <i>now</i>"&mdash;muttered Bess,
as her face shone with a glance of
momentary compassion&mdash;"She is
sold into the arms of shame!"</p>

<p>And at that moment, as the bride
stood in all her beauty before the altar,
her eyes downcast, her long hair
showering down over her shoulders,
her face warming with blush after
blush, while her voice in low tones
murmured each trembling response of
the fatal ceremony, at the very moment
when Lorrimer gazing upon her
face with a look of the deepest satisfaction,
fancied the fulfilment of the
maiden's dishonor, there shrieked
from the next chamber, a yell of such
superhuman agony and horror, that
the wedding guests were frozen with
a sudden awe, and transfixed like
figures of marble to the floor.</p>

<p>The book fell from Petriken's trembling

<!-- page 82 col 2 -->

hands; Mutchins turned pale,
and the old hag started backward
with sudden horror, while Bess stood
as though stricken with the touch of
death. Mary, poor Mary, grew white
as the grave-cloth, in the face; her
hand dropped stiffly to her side, and
she felt her heart grow icy within her
bosom.</p>

<p>Lorrimer alone, fearless and undaunted,
turned in the direction from
whence that fearful yell had shrieked,
and as he turned he started back with
evident surprise, mingled with some
feelings of horror and alarm.</p>

<p>There, striding along the floor,
came the figure of a young man,
whose footsteps trembled as he walked,
whose face was livid as the face
of a corpse, whose long black hair
waved wild and tangled, back from
his pale forehead. His eye&mdash;Great
God!&mdash;it shone as with a gleam
from the flames of hell.</p>

<p>He moved his trembling lips, as he
came striding on&mdash;for a moment the
word, he essayed to speak, stuck in
his throat.</p>

<p>At last with a wild movement of his
arms, he shouted in a voice whose
tones of horror, mingled with heart-rending
pathos, no man would like
to hear twice in a life time, he shouted
a single word&mdash;</p>

<p>"MARY!"</p>

<p>The bride turned slowly round.
Her face was pale as death, and her
blue eyes grew glassy as she turned.
She beheld the form of the intruder.
One glance was enough.</p>

<p>"MY BROTHER!" she shrieked,
and started forward as though about

<!-- page 83 col 1 -->

to spring in the strangers arms; but
suddenly recoiling she fell heavily
upon the breast of Lorrimer.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence&mdash;all
was hushed as the grave.</p>

<p>The stranger stood silent and motionless,
regarding the awe-stricken
bridal party, with one settled and
burning gaze. One and all, they
shrank back as if blasted by his look.
Even Lorrimer turned his head aside
and held his breath, for very awe.</p>

<p>The stranger advanced another step,
and stood gazing in Lorrimer's face.</p>

<p>"<i>My Sister!</i>" he cried in a husky
voice, and then as if all further words
died in his throat, his face was convulsed
by a spasmodic movement, and
he shook his clenched hand madly in
the seducer's face.</p>

<p>"Your name&mdash;" cried Lorrimer,
as he laid the fainting form of the
Bride in the arms of Long-haired
Bess&mdash;"Your name is Byrnewood.
This lady is named Mary Arlington.
There is some mistake here. The
lady is no sister of yours&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My name&mdash;" said the other, with
a ghastly smile&mdash;"Ask this pale-faced
craven what is my name! He introduced
me to you, this night by my full
name. You at once forgot, all but my
first name. My name, sir, is <i>Byrnewood
Arlington</i>. A name, sir, you
will have cause to remember in this
world and&mdash;devil that you are!&mdash;in
the next if you harm the slightest hair
on the head of this innocent girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lorrimer started back aghast. The
full horror of his mistake rushed upon
him. And in that moment, while the
fainting girl lay insensible in Bessie's
arms; while Petriken, and Mutchins,
and the haggard old Abbess of the

<!-- page 83 col 2 -->

den, stood stricken dumb with astonishment,
quailing beneath the glance of
the stranger; a long and bony arm
was thrust from behind the back of
Byrnewood Arlington, the grim face
Devil-Bug shone for a moment in the
light, and then a massive hand with
talon-fingers, fell like a weight upon
the wick of each candle, and the room
was wrapt in midnight blackness.</p>

<p>Then there was a trampling of feet
to and fro, a gleam of light flashed for
a moment, through the passage, opening
into the Rose Chamber, and then
all was dark again.</p>

<p>"They are bearing my sister
away!" was the thought that flashed
over the mind of the Brother, as he
rushed toward the passage of the Rose
Chamber&mdash;"I will rescue her from
their grasp at the peril of my life!"</p>

<p>He rushed along, in the darkness,
toward the curtain that concealed the
entrance into the Rose Chamber. He
attempted to pass beyond the curtain,
but he was received in the embrace of
two muscular arms, that raised him
from his feet as though he had been a
mere child, and then dashed him to
the floor, with the impulse of a giant's
strength.</p>

<p>"Ha-ha-ha!&mdash;" laughed a hoarse
voice&mdash;"You don't pass here, Mister.
Not while 'Bijah's about! No you
don't, my feller&mdash;ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"A light, Devil-Bug&mdash;" exclaimed
a voice, that sounded from the centre
of the darkened room.</p>

<p>In a moment a light, grasped in the
talon-fingers of the Doorkeeper of
Monk-Hall, flashed around the place.
Silent and alone Gus Lorrimer, stood
in the centre of the room, his arms

<!-- page 84 col 1 -->

folded across his breast, while the dark
frown on his brow was the only outward
manifestation of the violence of
the struggle that had convulsed his
very soul, during that solitary moment
of utter darkness. Calling all
the resources of his mind to his aid,
he had resolved upon his course of
action.</p>

<p>"<i>It is a fearful remedy, but a sure
one</i>&mdash;" he muttered as he again faced
Byrnewood, who had just risen from
the floor, where he had been thrown
by Mr. Abijah K. Jones&mdash;"Begone
Devil-Bug&mdash;" he continued aloud&mdash;"But
wait without and see that Glow-worm
and Musquito are at hand," He
added in a meaning whisper. "Now
Sir, I have a word to say to <i>you</i>&mdash;"
And as he spoke he confronted the
Brother of the girl, whose ruin he had
contrived with the ingenuity of an
accomplished libertine, mingled with
all the craft of an incarnate fiend.</p>

<p>Aching in every limb from his recent
fall, Byrnewood stood pale and
silent, regarding the libertine with a
settled gaze. In the effort to command
his feelings, he pressed his teeth against
his lower lip, until a thin line of blood
trickled down to his chin.</p>

<p>"You will allow that this, is a most
peculiar case&mdash;" he exclaimed with
a calm gaze, as he confronted Byrnewood&mdash;"One
in fact, that demands
some painful thought. Will you favor
me with ten minutes private conversation?"</p>

<p>"You are very polite&mdash;" exclaimed
Byrnewood with a withering sneer&mdash;"Here
is a man, who commits a wrong
for which h&mdash;ll itself has no name,
and then&mdash;instead of shrinking from
the sight of the man he has injured,

<!-- page 84 col 2 -->

beyond the power of words to tell&mdash;he
coolly demands ten minutes private
conversation!"</p>

<p>"It is your interest to grant my request&mdash;"
replied Lorrimer, with a
manner as collected as though he had
merely said 'Pass the bottle, Byrnewood!' "</p>

<p>"I presume I must submit&mdash;" replied
Byrnewood&mdash;"But after the ten
minutes are past&mdash;remember&mdash;that
there is not a fiend in hell whom I
would not sooner hug to my bosom,
than grant one moment's conversation
to&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;man&mdash;ha, ha&mdash;a <i>man</i>
like you. My sister's honor may be
in your power. But remember&mdash;that
as surely as you wrong her, so surely
you will pay for that wrong, with
your life&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You then, grant me ten minutes
conversation? You give me your
word that during this period, you will
keep your seat, and listen patiently to
all, that I may have to say? You nod
assent. Follow me, then. A footstep
or so this way, will lead us to a pleasant
room, the last of this range,
where we can talk the matter over&mdash;"</p>

<p>He flung open the western door of
the Walnut room, and led the way
along a narrow entry, up a stairway
with some five steps, and in a moment
stood before a small doorway, closing
the passage at the head of the stairs.
At every footstep of the way, he held
the light extended at arm's length, and
regarded Byrnewood with the cautious
glance of a man who is not certain,
at what moment, a concealed enemy
may strike him in the back.</p>

<p>"My Library Sir&mdash;" exclaimed
Lorrimer as pushing open the door, he
entered a small oblong room, some

<!-- page 85 col 1 -->

twenty-feet in length and about half
that extent in width. "A quiet little
place where I sometimes amuse myself
with a book. There is a chair
Sir&mdash;please be seated&mdash;"</p>

<p>Seating himself upon a small stool,
that stood near the wall of the room,
furthest from the door, Byrnewood
with a single glance, took in all the
details of the place. It was a small
unpretending room, oblong in form,
with rows of shelves along its longest
walls, facing each other, supplied with
books of all classes, and of every description,
from the ponderous history to
the trashy novel. The other walls at
either end, were concealed by plain
and neat paper, of a modern pattern,
which by no means harmonized with
the ancient style of the carpet, whose
half-faded colors glowed dimly in the
light. Along the wall of the chamber
opposite Byrnewood, extended an old-fashioned
sofa, wide and roomy as a
small sleeping couch; and from the
centre of the place, arose a massive
table, fashioned like a chest, with substantial
sides of carved oak, supplying
the place of legs. To all appearance
it was fixed and jointed, into the
floor of the room.</p>

<p>Altogether the entire room, as its
details were dimly revealed by the
beams of the flickering lamp, wore a
cheerless and desolate look, increased
by the absence of windows from the
walls, and the ancient and worn-out
appearance which characterized the
stool, the sofa and the table; the only
furniture of the place. There was no
visible hearth, and no sign of fire,
while the air cold and chilling had a
musty and unwholesome taint, as

<!-- page 85 col 2 -->

though the room had not been visited
or opened for years.</p>

<p>Placing the lamp on the solitary table,
Lorrimer flung himself carelessly
on the sofa, and motioned Byrnewood,
to draw his seat nearer to the light.
As Byrnewood seated himself beside
the chest-like table, with his cheek
resting on his hand, the full details of
his countenance, so pale, so colorless,
so corpse-like, were disclosed to the
keen gaze of Lorrimer. The face of
the Brother, was perfectly calm, although
the large black eyes, dilated
with a glance that revealed the Soul,
turning madly on itself and gnawing
its own life, in very madness of
thought, while from the lips tightly
compressed, there still trickled down,
the same thin line of blood, rendered
even more crimson and distinct,
by the extreme pallor of the
countenance.</p>

<p>"You will at least admit, that <i>I
have won the wager</i>&mdash;" said Lorrimer,
in a meaning tone, as he fixed
his gaze upon the death-like countenance
of Byrnewood Arlington.</p>

<p>Byrnewood started, raised his hands
suddenly, as if about to grasp the libertine
by the throat, and then folding his
arms tightly over his chest, he exclaimed
in a voice marked by unnatural
calmness&mdash;</p>

<p>"For ten minutes, sir, I have promised
to listen to all&mdash;<i>all</i> you may
have to say. Go on, sir. But do not,
I beseech you, tempt me too far&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly half-past three by my repeater&mdash;"
coolly replied Lorrimer,
looking at his watch&mdash;"At twenty
minutes of four, our conversations ends.
Very good. Now, sir, listen to my

<!-- page 86 col 1 -->

proposition. Give me your word of
honor, and your oath, that when you
leave this house, you will preserve the
most positive secrecy with regard to&mdash;to&mdash;<i>everything</i>&mdash;you
may have
witnessed within its walls; promise
me this, under your word of honor and
your solemn oath, and I will give you
my word of honor, my oath, that, in
one hour from daybreak, your sister
shall be taken to her home, pure and
stainless, as when first she left her father's
threshold. Do you agree to
this?"</p>

<p>"Do you see this hand?" answered
Byrnewood, with a nervous tremor
of his lips, that imparted an almost
savage sneer to his countenance&mdash;"Do
you see this flame? Sooner than
agree to leave these walls, without&mdash;my&mdash;my&mdash;without
Mary, pure and
stainless, mark ye, would hold this
good right hand in the blaze of this
lamp, until the flesh fell blackened and
festering from the very bone. Are
you answered?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir&mdash;I was not speaking
of any <i>anatomical experiments</i>;
however interesting such little efforts
in the surgical line, may be to you. I
wished to make a compromise&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>A compromise!</i>" echoed Byrnewood.</p>

<p>"Yes, a compromise. That melodramatic
sneer becomes you well, but
it would suit the pantomimist at the
Walnut Street Theatre much better.
What have I done with the girl, that you,
or any other young blood about town,
would <i>not</i> do, under similar circumstances?
Who was it, that entered
so heartily into the joke of the <i>sham</i>
marriage, when it was named in the
Oyster Cellar? Who was it called

<!-- page 86 col 2 -->

the astrologer a knave&mdash;a fortune
teller&mdash;a catch-penny cheat, when
he&mdash;simple man!&mdash;advised me to
give up the girl? I perceive, sir, you
are touched. I am glad to observe,
that you appreciate the graphic truth
of my remarks. You will not sneer
at the word '<i>compromise</i>' again, will
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary! oh, Mary!" whispered
Byrnewood, drawing his arms yet
more closely over his breast, as though
in the effort to command his agitation&mdash;"Mary!
Was I placing your honor
in the dice-box, when I made the
wager with yonder&mdash;<i>man?</i> Was it
your ruin the astrologer foretold, when
he urged this <i>devil</i>&mdash;to turn back in
his career? Was it my <i>voice</i> that
cheered <i>him</i> onward in his work of
infamy? Oh Mary, was it for <i>this</i>,
for <i>this</i>, that I loved you as brother
never loved sister? Was it for this,
that I wound you close to my inmost
heart, since first I could think or feel?
Was it for <i>this</i>, that in the holiest of
all my memories, all my hopes, your
name was enshrined? Was it for this,
that I pictured, again and again, every
hour in the day, every moment of the
night, the unclouded prospects of your
future life? Oh Mary, oh Mary, I
may be wrong, I may be vile, I may
be sunken as low as the man before
me, yet my love for you, has been
without spot, and without limit! And
now Mary&mdash;oh <i>now</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused. There was a husky
sound in his throat, and the blood
trickled faster from his tortured lip.</p>

<p>Lorrimer looked at him silently for
a moment, and then, taking a small
pen-knife from his pocket, began to
pare his nails, with a quiet and absent

<!-- page 87 col 1 -->

air, as though he didn't exactly know
what to do with himself. He wore
the careless and easy look of a gentleman,
who having just dined, is
wondering where in the deuce he shall
spend the afternoon.</p>

<p>"I say, Byrnie my boy&mdash;" he cried
suddenly, with his eyes fixed on the
operations of the knife&mdash;"Devilish
odd, ain't it? That little affair of
yours, with <i>Annie?</i> Wonder if she
has any <i>brother?</i> Keen cut <i>that</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>Had Mr. Lorrimer intended the allusion,
about the keenness of the 'cut,'
for Byrnewood instead of his nail-paring
knife, the remark would, perhaps,
have been equally applicable. Byrnewood
shivered at the name of Annie,
as though an ague-fit had passed suddenly
over him. The 'cut' was rather
keen, and somewhat deep. This careless
kind of intellectual surgery, sometimes
makes ghastly wounds in the
soul, which it so pleasantly dissects.</p>

<p>"May I ask what will be your
course, in case you leave this place,
without the lady? You are silent. I
suppose there will be a suit instituted
for '<i>abduction</i>,' and a thousand legal
et ceteras? This place will be ransacked
for the girl, and your humble servant
will be threatened with the Penitentiary?
A pleasant prospect, truly.
Why do you look so earnestly at that
hand?"</p>

<p>"You have your pleasant prospects&mdash;I
have mine&mdash;" exclaimed Byrnewood
with a convulsive smile&mdash;"You
see that right hand, do you? I was
just thinking, how long it might be,
ere that hand would be reddened with
your heart's blood&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Poh! poh! Such talk is d&mdash;d

<!-- page 87 col 2 -->

boyish. D'ye agree to my proposition?
Yes or no?"</p>

<p>"You have had my answer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In case I surrender the girl to you,
will you then promise unbroken secrecy,
with regard to the events of
this night?"</p>

<p>"I will make no terms whatever
with a <i>scoundrel</i> and a <i>coward!</i>"
hissed Byrnewood, between his clenched
teeth.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! It is high time this mask
should be cast aside&mdash;" exclaimed
Lorrimer, as his eye flashed with an
expression of triumph, mingled with
anger and scorn&mdash;"And do you suppose
that on any condition, or for any
consideration, I would leave this fair
prize slip from my grasp? Why, innocent
that you are, you might have
piled oath on oath, until your very
breath grew husky in the effort, and
still&mdash;still&mdash;despite of all your oaths,
the girl would remain mine!</p>

<p>"Know me as I am! Not the mere
man-about-town, not the wine-drinking
companion, not the fashionable
addle-head you think me, but the
<i>Man of Pleasure!</i> You will please
observe, how much lies concealed in
that title. You have talents&mdash;these
talents have been from childhood, devoted
to books, or mercantile pursuits.
I have some talent&mdash;I flatter myself&mdash;and
that talent, aided and strengthened
in all its efforts, by wealth, from very
boyhood, has been devoted to Pleasure,
which, in plain English, means&mdash;Woman.</p>

<p>"Woman&mdash;the means of securing
her affection, of compassing her ruin,
of enjoying her beauty, has been my
book, my study, my science, nay my

<!-- page 88 col 1 -->

<i>profession</i> from boyhood. And am I,
to be foiled in one of the most intricate
of all my adventures, by such a
child&mdash;a mere boy like you? Are
you to frighten me, to scare me back
in the path I have chosen; to wrest
this flower, to obtain which I have
perilled so much, are <i>you</i> to wrest this
flower from <i>my</i> grasp? You are <i>so</i>
strong, <i>so</i> mighty, you talk of reddening
your hand in my heart's blood&mdash;and
all such silly vaporing, that would
be hissed by the pit-boys, if they but
heard it, spouted forth by a fifth-rate
hero of the green-room&mdash;and yet
with all this&mdash;<i>you are my prisoner</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Your prisoner?</i>" echoed Byrnewood
slowly rising to his feet.</p>

<p>"Keep cool Sir&mdash;" cried Lorrimer
with a glance of scorn&mdash;"Two minutes
of the ten, yet remain. I have
your word of honor, you will remember.
Yes&mdash;<i>my prisoner!</i> Why
do you suppose for a moment, that I
would let you go forth from this house,
when you have it in your power to
raise the whole city on my head?
You know that I have placed myself
under the ban of the laws by this adventure.
You know that the Penitentiary
would open its doors to enclose
me, in case I was to be tried for this
affair. You know that popular indignation,
poverty and disgrace, stare me
in the very eyes, the moment this adventure
is published to the world, and
yet&mdash;ha, ha, ha&mdash;you still think me,
the egregious ass, to open the doors
of Monk-Hall to you, and pleasantly
bid you go forth, and ruin me forever!
Sir, you are my prisoner."</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha! I will be even
with you&mdash;" laughed Byrnewood&mdash;"You

<!-- page 88 col 2 -->

may murder me, in the act but
I still have the power to arouse the
neighborhood. I can shriek for help.
I can yell out the cry of Murder, from
this foul den, until your doors are flung
open by the police, and the secrets of your
rookery laid bare to the public gaze&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Scream, yell, cry out, until your
throat cracks! Who will hear you?
Do you know how many feet, you are
standing, above the level of the earth?
Do you know the thickness of these
walls? Do you know that you stand
in the Tower Room of Monk-Hall?
Try your voice&mdash;by all means&mdash;I
should like to hear you cry Murder or
Fire, or even hurra for some political
candidate, if the humor takes you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Byrnewood sank slowly in his seat,
and rested his cheek upon his hand.
His face was even paler than before&mdash;the
consciousness that he was in the
power of this libertine, for life or death,
or any act of outrage, came stealing
round his heart, like the probings of
a surgeon's knife.</p>

<p>"Go on Sir&mdash;" he muttered biting
his nether lip, until the blood once
more came trickling down to his
chin&mdash;"The hour is yours. <i>Mine
will come</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At my bidding; not a moment
sooner&mdash;" laughed Lorrimer rising
his feet&mdash;"Why man, death surrounds
you in a thousand forms,
and you know it not. You may walk on
Death, you may breathe it, you may
drink it, you may draw it to you with
a finger's-touch, and yet be as unconscious
of its presence, as a blind man
is of a shadow in the night&mdash;"</p>

<p>Byrnewood slowly rose from his
seat. He clasped his hands nervously

<!-- page 89 col 1 -->

together, and his lips muttered an incoherent
sound as he endeavored to
speak.</p>

<p>"Do what you will with me&mdash;" he
cried, in a husky voice&mdash;"But oh, for
the sake of God, <i>do not wrong my
sister!</i>"</p>

<p>"She is in <i>my</i> power!" whispered
Lorrimer, with a smile, as he gazed
upon the agitated countenance of the
brother&mdash;"She is in <i>my</i> power!"</p>

<p>"Then by the eternal God, you are
in mine!" shrieked Byrnewood, as
with one wild bound, he sprang at the
tall form of Lorrimer, and fixed both
hands around his throat, with a grasp
like that of the tigress when she fights
for her young&mdash;"You are in my
power! You cannot unloose my grasp!
Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;you grow black in the
face! Struggle!&mdash;struggle!&mdash;With
all your strength you cannot tear my
hands from your throat&mdash;you shall
die like a felon, by the eternal God!"</p>

<p>Lorrimer was taken by complete
surprise. The wild bound of Byrnewood
had been so sudden, the grasp
of his hands, was so much like the
terrific clutch with which the drowning
man makes a last struggle for life,
that for a single moment, the handsome
Gus Lorrimer reeled to and fro
like a drunken man, while his manly
features darkened over with a hue of
livid blackness, as ghastly as it was
instantaneous. The struggle lasted
but a single moment. With the convulsive
grasp tightening around his
throat, Lorrimer sank suddenly on
one knee, dragging his antagonist with
him, and as he sank, extending his
arm, with an effort as desperate as that
which fixed the clenched fingers

<!-- page 89 col 2 -->

around his throat, he struck Byrnewood
a violent blow with his fist, directly
behind the ear. Byrnewood
sank senseless to the floor, his fingers
unclosing their grasp of Lorrimer's
throat, as slowly and stiffly as though
they were seized with a sudden cramp.</p>

<p>"Pretty devilish and d&mdash;d hasty!"
muttered Lorrimer, arranging his cravat
and vest&mdash;"Left the marks of his
fingers on my throat, I'll be bound!
Hallo&mdash;Musquito! Hallo, Glow-worm&mdash;here's
work for you!"</p>

<p>The door of the room swung suddenly
open, and the herculean negroes
stood in the doorway, their sable faces,
agitated by the same hideous grin,
while the sleeves of the red flannel
shirts, which formed their common
costume, rolled up to the shoulders
disclosed the iron-sinews of their jet-black
arms.</p>

<p>"Mark this man, I say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Massa&mdash;I doo-es&mdash;"
chuckled Musquito, as his loathsome
lips, inclining suddenly downward toward
the jaw, on either side of his
face, were convulsed by a brutal grin&mdash;"Dis
nigger nebber mark a man
yet, but dat <i>somefin</i>' cum ob it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Massa Gusty no want de critter to
go out ob dis 'ere door?" exclaimed
Glow-worm, as the long rows of his
teeth, bristling from his thick lips,
shone in the light like the fangs of
some strange beast&mdash;"S'pose he go
out ob dat door? S'pose de nigger
no mash him head, <i>bad?</i> Ain't Glow-worm
got fist? Hah-hah! 'Sketo
did you ebber see dis chile (child)
knock an ox down? Hah-hah!"</p>

<p>"You are to watch outside the door
all night&mdash;" exclaimed Lorrimer, as

<!-- page 90 col 1 -->

he stood upon the threshold&mdash;"Let
him not leave the room on the peril of
your lives. D'ye mark me, fellows?"</p>

<p>And as he spoke, motioning the negroes
from the room, he closed the
door and disappeared.</p>

<p>He had not gone a moment when
Byrnewood, recovering from the stunning
effect of the blow which had saved
Lorrimer's life, slowly staggered to
his feet, and gazed around with a bewildered
glance.</p>

<p>" '<i>On Christmas Eve</i>&mdash;' " he murmured
wildly, as though repeating
words whispered to his ear in a dream&mdash;"
'<i>On Christmas Eve, at the hour
of sundown, one of ye will die by the
other's hand&mdash;the winding sheet is
woven and the coffin made!</i>' "</p>

<p>"IT don't skeer me, I tell ye! For
six long years, day and night, it has
laid by my side, with its jaw broke
and its tongue stickin' out, and yet I
ain't a bit skeered! There it is now&mdash;on
the left side, ye mind&mdash;in the
light of the fire. Ain't it an ugly
corpse? Hey? A reel nasty christian,
I tell ye! Jist look at the knees,
drawed up to the chin, jist look at the
eyes, hanging out on the cheeks, jist
look at the jaw all smashed and broke&mdash;look
at the big, black tongue,
stickin' from between the teeth&mdash;say
it ain't an ugly corpse, will ye?</p>

<p>"Sometimes I can hear him groan&mdash;<i>only</i>
sometimes! I've always noticed
when anything bad is a-goin' to

<!-- page 90 col 2 -->

come across me, that critter groans
and groans! Jist as I struck him
down, he lays afore me now. Whiz&mdash;wh-i-z
he came down the hatchway&mdash;three
stories, every bit of it!
Curse it, why hadn't I the last trap-door
open? He fell on the floor, pretty
much mashed up, but&mdash;but he wasn't
dead&mdash;</p>

<p>"He riz on his feet. Just as he lays
on the floor&mdash;in his shirt sleeves, with
his jaw broke and his tongue out&mdash;he
riz on his feet. Didn't he groan? I
put him down, I tell ye! Down&mdash;down!
Ha! What was a sledge hammer
to this fist, in that pertikler minnit?
Crack, crack went the spring of
the last trap-door and the body fell&mdash;the
devil knows where&mdash;I don't.
I put it out o' my sight, and yet it
came back to me, and crouched down
at my side, the next minnit. It's been
there ever since. If I sleep, or if I'm
wide awake, it's there there always
on my left side, where I hain't
got no eye to see it, and yet I do&mdash;I
<i>do</i> see it. What a cussed fool I was
arter all! To kill him, and he not
got a cent in his pockets! Bah!
Whenever I think of it I grow feverish.
And there he is now&mdash;With his
d&mdash;d ugly jaw. How he lolls his
tongue out&mdash;and his eyes! Ugh!
But I ain't a bit skeered. No. Not
me. I can bear wuss things than that
'are&mdash;"</p>

<p>The light from the blazing coal-fire,
streamed around the Doorkeeper's
den. Seated close by the grate, in a
crouching attitude, his feet drawn together,
his big hands grasping each
knee with a convulsive clutch, his
head lowered on his breast, and his
face, warmed to a crimson red by the

<!-- page 91 col 1 -->

glare of the flame, moistened with
thick drops of perspiration; Devil-Bug
turned the orbless eye-socket to
the floor at his left side, as though it
was gifted with full powers of sight,
while his solitary eye, grew larger and
more burning in its fixed gaze, until
at last, it seemed to stand out, from
his overhanging brow, like a separate
flame.</p>

<p>The agitation of the man was at
once singular and fearful. Oozing from
his swarthy brow, the thick drops of
sweat fell trickling over his hideous
face, moistening his matted hair, until
it hung, damp and heavy over his
eyebrows. The lips of his wide mouth
receding to his flat nose and pointed
chin, disclosed the long rows of bristling
teeth, fixed as closely together, as
though the man, had been suddenly
seized with lock-jaw. His face was
all one loathsome grimace, as with his
blazing eye, fixed upon the fire, he
seemed gazing upon the floor at his
left, with the shrunken and eyeless
socket, of the other side of his face.</p>

<p>This creature, who sate crouching
in the light of the fire, muttering
words of strange meaning to himself,
presented a fearful study for the Christian
and Philanthropist. His Soul
was like his body, a mass of hideous
and distorted energy.</p>

<p>Born in a brothel, the offspring of
foulest sin and pollution, he had grown
from very childhood, in full and continual
sight of scenes of vice, wretchedness
and squalor.</p>

<p>From his very birth, he had breathed
an atmosphere of infamy.</p>

<p>To him, there was no such thing as
<i>good</i> in the world.</p>

<!-- page 91 col 2 -->

<p>His world&mdash;his place of birth, his
home in infancy, childhood and manhood,
his only theatre of action&mdash;had
been the common house of ill-fame.
No mother had ever spoken words of
kindness to him; no father had ever
held him in his arms. Sister, brother,
friends; he had none of these. He
had come into the world without a
name; his present one, being the standing
designation of the successive Doorkeepers
of Monk-Hall, which he in vain
endeavored to assume, leaving the
slang title bestowed on him in childhood,
to die in forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Abijah K. Jones he might call himself,
but he was Devil-Bug still.</p>

<p>His loathsome look, his distorted
form, and hideous soul, all seemed to
crowd on his memory, at the same moment,
when the word 'Devil-Bug'&mdash;rang
on his ear. That word uttered, and he
stood apart from the human race; that
word spoken, and he seemed to feel,
that he was something distinct from the
mass of men, a wild beast, a snake, a
reptile, or a devil incarnate&mdash;any
thing but a&mdash;man.</p>

<p>The same instinctive pleasure that
other men, may feel in acts of benevolence,
of compassion or love, warmed
the breast of Devil-Bug, when enjoyed
in any deed, marked by especial <i>cruelty</i>.
This word will scarcely express
the instinctive impulse of his soul.
He loved not so much to kill, as to observe
the blood of his victim, fall drop
by drop, as to note the convulsive look
of death, as to hear the last throttling
rattle in the throat of the dying.</p>

<p>For years and years, the instinctive
impulse, had worked in his own bosom,
without vent. The murder which had
dyed his hands, with human blood for

<!-- page 92 col 1 -->

the first time, some six years ago,
opened wide to his soul, the pathway of
crime, which it was his doom and his delight
to tread. Ever since the night of the
Murder, his victim, hideous and repulsive,
had lain beside him, crushed and
mangled, as he fell through the death-trap.
The corpse was never absent
from his fancy; which in this instance
had assumed the place of eyesight. Did
he sit&mdash;it was at his left side. Did
he walk&mdash;crushed and mangled as it
was, it glided with him. Did he
sleep&mdash;it still was at his side, ever
present with him, always staring him
in the face, with all its loathsome details
of horror and bloodshed.</p>

<p>Since the night of the Murder, a
longing desire had grown up, within
this creature, to lay another corpse beside
his solitary victim. Were there
he thought, two corses, ever at his
side, the terrible details of the mangled
form and crushed countenance of
the first, would lose half their horror,
all their distinctness. He longed to
surround himself with the Phantoms
of new victims. In the <i>number</i> of his
crimes, he even anticipated pleasure.</p>

<p>It was this man, this deplorable moral
monstrosity, who knew no God,
who feared no devil, whose existence
was one instinctive impulse of cruelty
and bloodshed, it was this Outlaw of
heaven and earth and hell, who held
the life of Byrnewood Arlington in
his grasp.</p>

<p>"It's near about mornin' and that
'ere boy ought to have somethin' to eat.
A leetle to drink&mdash;per'aps? Now
<i>sup</i>-pose, I should take him up, a
biled chicken and a bottle o' wine.

<!-- page 92 col 2 -->

He sits down by the table o' course to
eat&mdash;I fix his plate on a pertikler side.
As he planks down into the cheer, his
foot touches a spring. What is the
consekence? He git's a fall and hurts
hisself. <i>Sup</i>-pose he drinks the wine?
Three stories down the hatchway&mdash;reether
an ugly tumble. He gits crazy,
and won't know nothin' for days.
Very pecooliar wine&mdash;got it from the
Doctor who used to come here&mdash;dint
kill a man, only makes him mad-like.
The Man with th' Poker isn't nothin'
to this stuff&mdash;Hallo! Who's there?"</p>

<p>"Only me, 'Bijah&mdash;" cried a woman's
voice, and the queenly form of
Long Haired Bess with a dark shawl
thrown over her bridesmaid's dress advanced
toward the light&mdash;"I've just
left Lorrimer. He's with the girl you
know? He sent me down here, to tell
you to keep close watch on that young
fellow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jist as if I couldn't do it mesself&mdash;"
grunted Abijah in his grindstone
voice&mdash;"Always a-orderin' a feller
about? That's his way. S'pose you
cant make yourself useful? Kin you?
Then take some biled chicken and
a bottle o' wine up to the younk chap.
Guess he's most starved&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shall I get the chicken and the
wine?" asked Bess gazing steadily in
Abijah's face.</p>

<p>"What the thunder you look in my
face that way fur? No you shan't git
'em. Git 'em mesself. Wait here
till I come back. Don't let any one
in without the password&mdash;'What
hour of the night&mdash;' and the answer
'Dinner time&mdash;' you know?"</p>

<p>And as Devil-Bug strode heavily
from the den, and was heard going
down into the cellars of the mansion,

<!-- page 93 col 1 -->

Bess stood silent and erect before the
fire, her face, shadowed by an expression
of painful thought, while her
dark eyes, shot a wild glance from beneath
her arching brows, suddenly
compressed in a frown.</p>

<p>"Some mischief at work I suppose&mdash;"
she whispered in a hissing
voice&mdash;"I've sold myself to shame,
but not to Murder!"</p>

<p>A low knock resounded from the
front door.</p>

<p>Suddenly undrawing the bolt and
flinging the chain aside, Bess gazed
through a crevice of the opened door,
upon the new-comers, who stood beyond
the outside door of green-blinds.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" she said in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;" laughed one of the
strangers&mdash;"It's bonny Bess. 'What
hour of the night' is it, my dear?"</p>

<p>" 'Dinner time', you fool&mdash;" replied
the young lady opening the outside
door&mdash;"Come in Luke! Ha!
There is a stranger with you! <i>Your
friend</i> Luke?"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, Bessie my love,&mdash;" answered
Luke as he entered the den,
with the stranger at his side&mdash;"Did
ye hear the Devil-Bug say, whether
there was fire in my room? all right&mdash;hey?
And <i>cards</i> you know Bess&mdash;<i>cards?</i>
This gentleman and I, want
to amuse ourselves with a little game.
By-the-bye&mdash;where's Fitz-Cowles?
I should like him to join us. Seen
him to-night my dear?"</p>

<p>"Up stairs you know Luke&mdash;" answered
Bess with a meaning smile&mdash;"
'<i>Veiled figure</i>,' Luke you know?
That's a game above your fancy I
should suppose?"</p>

<p>And as she said this with an expressive

<!-- page 93 col 2 -->

glance of her dark eye, Bess
observed that the stranger who accompanied
Luke, was a very tall, stout
man, wrapped up in a thick overcoat,
whose upraised collar, concealed his
face to the very eyes. His eyes were
visible for a single moment, however
as half-hidden by the shadow of
Luke's figure, the stranger strode
swiftly across the floor of the den.
Bess started, with a feeling of terror,
akin to the awe one experiences in the
presence of a madman, as those eyes,
so calm and yet so burning in their
fixed gaze, flashed for a moment in
the red light.</p>

<p>"Luke, I am&mdash;ready&mdash;" said the
Stranger in a smothered voice&mdash;"To
<i>the room</i> Luke&mdash;to <i>the Room!</i>"</p>

<p>Without a word Luke led the way
from the den, and in a moment Bess,
heard the half-hushed sound of their
footsteps, as they ascended the staircase
of the mansion.</p>

<p>"That's a strange eye for a man
who's only <i>a-goin</i>' to play cards&mdash;"
muttered Bess as she stood by the fire-place&mdash;"Now
it's more like the eye of
a man, who's been playin' all night,
and lost his very soul in a game with
the D&mdash;l! Lord!&mdash;But that's a wicked
eye for a dark night!"</p>

<p>"Here's the biled chicken and the
wine&mdash;" grated the harsh voice of
Devil-Bug, who approached the fire,
with a large 'waiter' in his arms&mdash;"Take
it up to the feller, Bess. He's
hungry p'r'aps? And d'ye mind gal&mdash;set
his plate on the side of the table,
furthest from the door?"</p>

<p>"Any particular reason for that,
'Bijah?"</p>

<p>"Cuss it gal, can't you do it, without
axeing questions? It's only a

<!-- page 94 col 1 -->

whim o' mine. That bottle is worth
its weight in red goold. Don't taste
such Madeery every day I tell you.
Poor fellow&mdash;guess he's a-most
starved&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well, I'll take him the chicken
and the wine&mdash;" exclaimed Bess
pleasantly as she took possession of
the 'waiter' with its cold chicken and
luscious wine&mdash;"Hang it though,
when I come to think o'it, why couldn't
you have taken it up yourself? 'Bijah
you're growin' lazy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mind gal&mdash;" grunted Devil-Bug
as the girl disappeared through the
door&mdash;"Set his plate on the side of
the table furthest from the door. D'ye
hear? It's a whim o' mine&mdash;furthest
from the door&mdash;d'ye hear?"</p>

<p>" 'Furthest from the door'&mdash;"echoed
Bess, and in a moment her footsteps
resounded with a low pattering noise
along the massive staircase.</p>

<p>"The <i>Spring</i>&mdash;and the <i>bottle</i>&mdash;"
muttered Devil-Bug as he resumed his
seat beside the fire&mdash;"It seems to
me, I should like to creep up stairs,
and listen at his door to see how them
things work. The niggers is there:
but no matter. May be he'll howl&mdash;or
groan&mdash;or do all sorts of ravin's?
Gusty did not exactly tell me to do all
this&mdash;but I guess he'll grin as wide
as anybody, <i>when the thing is done</i>.
It seems to me I should like, to see
how them things works. It 'ud be nice
to listen a bit at his door. Wonder if
that gal suspicions anything?"</p>

<p>He rubbed his hands earnestly together,
as a man is wont to do, under
the influence of some pleasing idea,
and his solitary eye, dilated and sparkled,
with a glance of the most remarkable

<!-- page 94 col 2 -->

satisfaction. A slight chuckle
shook his distorted frame, and his lips,
performed a succession of vivid spasms
which an ignorant observer might
have confounded under the general
name of laughter.</p>

<p>"Poor feller&mdash;guess he's cold without
a fire&mdash;" said complacent Devil-Bug
as he rubbed his hand cheerfully
together&mdash;"I might build him a little
fire. I might&mdash;I might&mdash;ha! ha!
ha!" he arose slowly to his feet, and
laughed so loud, that the echoes of his
voice resounded from the den, along
the hall, and up the staircase of the
mansion&mdash;"I might try <i>that</i>"&mdash;he cried
with a hideous glow of exultation&mdash;"Wonder
<i>how that</i> would <i>work?</i>"</p>

<p>Opening the door of a closet on one
side of the fire-place, he drew from its
depths, a small furnace of iron; such
as housewives use for domestic purposes.
He placed the furnace in the
full light of the fire, surveyed it closely,
rubbed his hands pleasantly together
yet once more, while a deep
chuckle shook his form, from head to
foot. His face wore an expression of
extreme good humor&mdash;the visage of
a drunken loafer, as he flings a penny
to a ragged sweep, was nothing in
comparison.</p>

<p>"A leetle kindlin' wood&mdash;" he
muttered, drawing to the fire an old
sack that had lain concealed in the
darkness&mdash;"And a leetle charcoal!
Makes a <i>rouging</i> hot fire! Fat pine
and charcoal&mdash;ha, ha, ha! Rather
guess the poor fellow's cold! Now
for a light&mdash;Cuss it how the fat pine
blazes!"</p>

<p>He waited but a single moment for
the wood and charcoal to ignite. It

<!-- page 95 col 1 -->

flared up at first in a smoky blaze, and
then subsided into a clear and brilliant
flame. Seizing the iron handle of the
furnace Devil-Bug suddenly raised it
from the floor, and rushed from the
den, and up the staircase of the mansion,
as though his very life hung on
his speed. And as he ascended the
stairway, the light of the furnace
gradually increasing to a vivid flame,
was thrown upward over his hideous
face, turning the beetling brow, the
flat nose and the wide mouth with its
bristling teeth, to a hue of dusky red.
One moment as he swung the furnace
from side to side, you beheld his face
and form in a glow of blood red light,
and the next it was suddenly lost to
view, while the vessel of iron, with its
burning coals, seemed gliding up the
stairway, impelled by a single swarthy
hand, with fingers like talons and
sinews starting out from the skin like
knotted cords.</p>

<p>"Halloo! I didn't know Monk
Luke was in his room&mdash;" he muttered,
as he paused for a moment before
a massive door, opening into the hall,
which extended along the mansion,
above the first stairway "There's a
streak of light from the keyhole of his
door! And voices inside the room&mdash;but
no matter! The charcoal's a-burn-in'&mdash;and&mdash;wonder
how <i>that 'ill
work?</i>"</p>

<p>And up the staircase of the mansion
he pursued his way, flinging the blazing
furnace from side to side, while his
face, grew like the visage of a very
devil, as again the words rose to his
lips&mdash;</p>

<p>"The charcoal's a-burnin'&mdash;wonder
how <i>that</i> 'ill work?"</p>

<!-- page 95 col 2 -->

<p>The light still flickered through the
keyhole of the massive door.</p>

<p>Within the sombre panels, it shone
over the rich furniture of an apartment,
long and wide, with high
ceiling and wainscotted walls. There
was a gorgeous carpet on the floor, a
thickly curtained bed in one corner, a
comfortable fire burning in the grate,
and a large table standing near the
centre of the room, on which a plain
lamp, darkened by a heavy shade, was
burning. The shade flung the light
of the lamp down over the table&mdash;it
was covered with books, cards, and
wine glasses&mdash;and around the carpet,
for the space of a yard or more, while
the other portions of the apartment,
were enveloped in faint twilight.</p>

<p>And in that dim light, near the fire,
stood two men, steadfastly regarding
each other in the face. The snake-like
eye of the tall and slender man,
was fixed in keen gaze upon the bronzed
face of his companion, whose stout
and imposing form seemed yet more
large and commanding in its proportions,
as occasional flashes from the
fire-place lighted up the dim twilight.
It was a strange thing, to see those
large blue eyes, gleaming from the
bronzed face, with such a calm and
yet burning lustre.</p>

<p>"Luke&mdash;to the&mdash;the&mdash;<i>room</i>&mdash;"
whispered a voice, husky with suppressed
agitation.</p>

<p>"He is calm&mdash;" muttered Luke to
himself&mdash;"I led him a d&mdash;l of a way
in order to give him time to command
his feelings. He is calm now&mdash;and&mdash;it's
<i>too late to go back</i>."</p>

<p>Extending his hand he reached a
small dark lanthern from the mantel-piece,

<!-- page 96 col 1 -->

and walked softly across the
floor. Opening the door of a wide
closet, he motioned Livingstone to
approach.</p>

<p>"You see, this is rather a spacious
closet&mdash;" Luke whispered, as silently
drawing Livingstone within the recess,
he closed the door, leaving them enveloped
in thick darkness&mdash;"The
back wall of the closet, is nothing less
than a portion of the wainscotting of
the next room. Give me your hand&mdash;it
is firm, by G&mdash;d!&mdash;Do you feel
that bolt? It's a little one, but once
withdrawn, the panelling swings
away from the closet like a door, and&mdash;egad!&mdash;the
next room lays before
you!"</p>

<p>While Livingstone stood in the thick
darkness of the closet, silent as death,
Luke slowly drew the bolt. Another
touch, and the door would swing open
into the next room. Luke could hear
the hard breathing of the Merchant,
and the hand which he touched suddenly
became cold as ice.</p>

<p>As though by mere accident, in that
moment of suspense, when their joined
fingers touched the bolt, Harvey allowed
the door of the dark lanthern,
to spring suddenly open. The face
of Livingstone, every line and feature,
was disclosed in the light, with appalling
distinctness. Luke was prepared
for a sight of some interest, but no
sooner did the light fall on the Merchant's
face, than he gave a start of
involuntary horror. It was as though
the face of a corpse, suddenly recalled
to life, had risen before him. White
and livid and ghastly, with the discolored
circles of flesh deepening beneath
each eye, and with the large
blue eyes, steadily glaring from the

<!-- page 96 col 2 -->

dark eyebrows, it was a countenance
to strike the very heart with fear and
horror. The firm lips wore a blueish
hue, as though the man had been dead
for days, and corruption was eating
its way through his vitals. Around
his high and massive brow, hung his
hair, in slight masses; fearful streaks
of white resting like scattered ashes,
among the locks of dark brown.</p>

<p>"Well, Luke&mdash;you see&mdash;I am
calm&mdash;" whispered Livingstone, smiling,
with his lips still compressed&mdash;"I&mdash;am&mdash;calm&mdash;"</p>

<p>Luke slowly withdrew the bolt, and
closed the door of the lanthern. The
secret door, of the wainscotting swung
open with a faint noise.</p>

<p>"Listen!" he whispered to Livingstone,
as the dark room lay before
them&mdash;"Listen!"</p>

<p>And with his very breath hushed,
Livingstone silently listened. A low
sound like a woman breathing in her
sleep, came faintly to his ear. Luke
felt the Merchant start as though he
was reeling beneath a sudden blow.</p>

<p>"Give me the dark lanthern&mdash;"
whispered Livingstone&mdash;"<i>The pistols
I have!</i>" he continued, hissing the
words through his clenched teeth&mdash;"The
room is dark, but I can discern
the outlines of the bed&mdash;"</p>

<p>He pressed Luke by the hand with
a firm grasp, took the lanthern, carefully
closing its door, and strode with
a noiseless footstep, into the dark
room.</p>

<p>Luke remained in the closet, listening
with hushed breath.</p>

<p>There was a pause for a moment.
It seemed an age to the listener. Not
a sound, not a footstep, not even the
rustling of the bed-curtains. All was

<!-- page 97 col 1 -->

silent as the grave-vault, which has
not been disturbed for years.</p>

<p>Luke listened. He leaned from
the closet and gazed into the dark
room. It was indeed dark. Not the
outline of a chair, or a sofa, or the
slightest piece of furniture could he
discern. True, near the centre of the
place, arose a towering object, whose
outlines seemed a shade lighter than
the rest of the room. This might be
the bed, thought Luke, and again,
holding his breath, he listened for the
slightest sound.</p>

<p>All was dark and still.</p>

<p>Presently Luke heard a low gurgling
noise, like the sound produced
by a drowning man. Then all was
silent as before.</p>

<p>In a moment the gurgling noise was
heard again, and a sudden blaze of
light streamed around the room.</p>

<p>CHAPTER TWELFTH.</p>

<p class="small">THE TOWER ROOM.</p>

</div>

<p>"MY sister is in his power, for any
act of wrong, for any deed of outrage!
And I cannot strike a blow in her defence!
A solitary wall may separate
us&mdash;in one room the sister pleads with
the villain for mercy&mdash;in the other,
trapped and imprisoned, the brother
hears her cry of agony, and cannot&mdash;cannot
raise a finger in her behalf!
Ha! The door is fast&mdash;I hear the
hushed breathing of negroes on the
 other side. I have read many legends
of a place of torment in the other
world, but what devil could contrive a
hell like this?"</p>

<!-- page 97 col 2 -->

<p>He flung himself on the sofa, and
covered his face with his hands. The
lamp burning dimly on the solitary
table, flung a faint and dusky light
around the walls of the Tower Room.</p>

<p>Byrnewood lay in dim shadow,
with his limbs thrown carelessly along
the sofa, his outspread hands covering
his face, while the long curls of his
raven-black hair, fell wild and tangled
over his forehead. As he lay there,
with his dress disordered and his form
resting on the sofa, in an attitude
which, careless as it was, resembled
the crouching position of one who suffers
from the cold chill succeeding
fever, you might have taken him for
an inanimate effigy, instead of a living
and breathing man.</p>

<p>No heaving of the chest, no quick
and gasping respiration, no convulsive
movements of the fingers, indicated
the agitation which shook his soul to
its centre. He lay quiet and motionless,
his white hands, concealing his
livid face, while a single glimpse of
his forehead was visible between the
tangled locks of his raven hair.</p>

<p>The silence of the room was broken
by the creaking of the door, as it
swung slowly open.</p>

<p>Bess silently entered the room, holding
the waiter with the cold chicken
and bottle of Madeira in her hands.
She hurriedly closed the door and advanced
to the solitary table. Her face
was very pale, and her long dark
hair, hung in disordered tresses around
her full voluptuous neck. The dark
shawl which she had thrown over her
bridesmaid's dress, had fallen from her
shoulders and hung loosely from her
arms as she walked. Her entire appearance
betrayed agitation and haste.</p>

<!-- page 98 col 1 -->

<p>"He sleeps!" she murmured, arranging
the refreshments&mdash;provided
by Devil-Bug&mdash;along the surface of
the chest-like table&mdash;" 'Fix his plate
on the side of the table furthest from
the door'&mdash;what could the monster
mean? Ha! There may be a secret
spring on that side of the table, which
the foot of the victim is designed to
touch. I'll warn him of his danger&mdash;and
then, the <i>bottle</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>She said she would warn Byrnewood
of his danger, and yet she lingered
about the small table, her confused
and hurried manner betraying her irresolution
and changeability of purpose.
Byrnewood still lay silent and
motionless on the sofa. As far from
slumber as the victim writhing on the
rack, he was still unconscious of the
presence of Long-haired Bess. His
mind was utterly absorbed in the harrowing
details of the mental struggle,
that shook his soul to its foundations.</p>

<p>At first, arranging the knife and
plate on one side of the table, and then
on the other, now placing the bottle in
one position and again in another, it
was evident that Long-haired Bess
was absent, confused and deeply agitated.
The side-long glance, which
every other instant, she threw over
her shoulder at the reclining form of
Byrnewood, was fraught with deep
and painful meaning. At last, with a
hurried footstep, she approached the
sofa, and glancing cautiously at the
door, which hung slightly ajar, she
laid her hand lightly on Byrnewood's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"I come to warn you of your
danger&mdash;" she whispered in his
ear.</p>

<p>Byrnewood looked up in wonder

<!-- page 98 col 2 -->

and then an expression of intolerable
disgust impressed every line of his
countenance.</p>

<p>"Your touch is pollution&mdash;" he
said, shaking her hand from his
shoulder&mdash;"You were one of the
minions of the villain. You plotted
my sister's dishonor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I come to warn you of your
danger!" whispered Bess, with a
flashing eye&mdash;"You behold refreshments
spread for you on yonder table.
You see the bottle o' wine. On peril
of your life don't drink anything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But rale good brandy&mdash;" grated
a harsh voice at her shoulder&mdash;"Liqu-ood
hell-fire forever! That's
the stuff, my feller! Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>With the same start of surprise,
Byrnewood sprang to his feet, and
Bess turned hurriedly around, while
their eyes were fixed upon the face of
the new-comer.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug, hideous and grinning,
with the furnace of burning coals in
his hand, stood before them. His
solitary eye rested upon the face of
Long-haired Bess with a meaning look,
and his visage passed through the series
of spasmodic contortions peculiar to his
expressive features, as he stood swinging
the furnace from side to side.</p>

<p>"You can go, Bessie, my duck&mdash;"
he said, with a pleasant way of speaking,
original with himself. "This
'ere party don't want you no more.
You see, my feller citizen&mdash;" he continued,
turning to Byrnewood&mdash;"yer
humble servant thought you might be
hungry, so he sent you suffin' to eat.
Thought you might be cold; so he
brung you some coals to warm yesself.
You can <i>re</i>-tire, Bessie&mdash;"</p>

<p>He gently led her to the door, fixing

<!-- page 99 col 1 -->

his eye upon her face, with a look,
as full of venom as a spider's sting.</p>

<p>"You'd a-spilt it all&mdash;would yo'?"
he hissed the whisper in her ear as he
pushed her from the room&mdash;"Good
night my dear&mdash;" he continued aloud&mdash;"You
better go home. Your
mammy's a waitin' tea for you. Now
I'll make you a little bit o' fire, Mister,
if you please&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fire?" echoed Byrnewood "I
see no fire-place&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all you know about it"&mdash;answered
Devil-Bug swinging the
furnace from side to side&mdash;"You
think them 'are's books do you? Look
a little closer, next time. The walls
are only painted like books and
shelves&mdash;false book-cases you see.
And then there's glass doors, jist like
real book-cases. They did it in the
old times&mdash;them queer old chaps as
used to keep house here, all alone to
themselves. Nice fire-place&mdash;ain't it?"</p>

<p>He opened two folding leaves of the
false book-case near the centre of the
wall opposite the door, and a small
fire-place neatly white-washed and
free from ashes or the remains of any
former fire, became visible. Stooping
on his knees, Devil-Bug proceeded
to arrange the furnace in the hearth,
while the half-closed folding leaves of
the book-case, well-nigh concealed
him from view.</p>

<p>"A false book-case on either side of
the room! Ha! Books of all classes,
painted on the panels, within the
sashes, with inimitable skill? They
deceived me, in the dim light of yonder
lamp. What can this mean? By
my life, I shrewdly suspect, that these
book-cases, conceal secret passages,
leading from this den&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 99 col 2 -->

<p>Byrnewood flung himself on the
sofa, and again covered his face with
his hands.</p>

<p>"Blazes up quite comfortable&mdash;"
muttered Devil-Bug, as half concealed
by the folding doors of the central
part of the book-case, he stooped over
the furnace of blazing coal, warming
his hands in the flame. "A nice fire,
and a nice fire-place. But I'll have to
discharge my bricklayer for one
thing. Got him to fix up this
harth not long ago. Scoundrel walled
up the chimbley. Did ye ever
hear of sich rascality? Konsekence
is, this young genelmen will be
rather uncomfortable a'cause, the
charcoal smoke won't find no vent.
If I should happen to shut the door
right tight he might die. He might
so. Things jist as bad have happened
afore now. He might die. Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha&mdash;"
he chuckled as he retired
from the fire-place, screening the blazing
furnace, with the half-closed
doors of the book-case&mdash;"Wonder
how <i>that</i> 'ill work!"</p>

<p>He approached the side of Byrnewood,
with that same hideous grin distorting
his features, but had not advanced
two steps, when he started
backward with a moment of involuntary
horror.</p>

<p>"Look here you sir&mdash;" he whispered
grasping Byrnewood by the arm&mdash;"Jist
look here a minnit. You see the
floor at my left side&mdash;do you? Now
tell us the truth, ain't there a dead man
layin' there? His jaw broke and his
tongue out? Not that I'm afeered,
but I wants to satisfy my mind. Jist
take a good look while I hold still&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see nothing but the carpet&mdash;"
answered Byrnewood with a look of

<!-- page 100 col 1 -->

loathing, as he observed this strange
being, standing before him, motionless
as a statute, while his left hand pointed
to the floor&mdash;"I see nothing but
the carpet."</p>

<p>"Don't see a dead man, with his
knees drawed up to his breast, and his
tongue stickin' out? Well that's
queer. I'd take my book oath, that
the feller was a layin' there, nasty as
a snake&mdash;Hows'ever <i>re</i>-fresh yourself
young man. There's plenty to
eat and drink and&mdash;" he pointed to
the hearth as he spoke&mdash;"There's a
nice comfortable fire. Good charcoal&mdash;and&mdash;I
wonders how <i>that</i> 'ill
<i>work</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>Closing the door, he stood in the
small recess, at the head of the stairs,
leading to the Tower Room. The
huge forms of the negroes, Musquito
and Glow-worm, were flung along the
floor, while their hard breathing indicated
that they slumbered on their
watch. Listening intently for a single
moment, at the door of the Tower Room,
Devil-Bug slowly turned the
key in the lock, and then withdrawing
it from the keyhole placed it in his
pocket. He stepped carefully over the
forms of the sleeping negroes, and
passed his hands slowly along the panelling
of the recess, opposite the door.</p>

<p>The spring&mdash;ha, ha&mdash;I've found
it&mdash;" he muttered in the darkness.&mdash;"The
book-cases don't conceal no passage
between the walls of this 'ere
Tower, and the room itself&mdash;do they?
O' course they do not. Quiet little
places where a feller can say his prayers
and eat ground-nuts. Ha! Ha!
Ha! I must see how <i>that</i> 'ill work."</p>

<p>The panelling slid back as he
touched the spring and Devil-Bug

<!-- page 100 col 2 -->

disappeared into the secret recess
or passage, between the false book-cases
and the massive walls of the
Tower; as the solitary chamber, rising
from the western wing of Monk-Hall,
was termed in the legends of the
place.</p>

<p>Meanwhile within the Tower Room,
Byrnewood Arlington paced slowly up
and down the floor, his arms folded,
and his face, impressed with a fixed
expression, that forced his lips tightly
together, darkened his brows in a settled
frown and drove the blood from
his entire visage, until it wore the livid
hues of death.</p>

<p>"My sister in his power! Last
night she was pure and stainless&mdash;to-morrow
morning dawns and she will be
a thing stained with pollution, dishonored
by a hideous crime! No lapse of
time, no prayers to Heaven, no bitter
tears of repentance can ever wash out
the foul stains of her dishonor. And
I am a prisoner, while she shrieks for
help and shrieks in vain&mdash;"</p>

<p>As Byrnewood spoke, striding rapidly
along the floor, a grateful warmth
began to steal around the room, dispelling
the chill and damp, which
seemed to infect the very air, with an
unwholesome taint.</p>

<p>"And we have been children together!
I have held her in these arms,
when she was but a babe&mdash;a smiling
babe, with golden hair and laughing
cheeks! And then when she left home
for school, how it wrung my soul to
part with her! So young, so light-hearted,
so innocent! Three years
pass&mdash;she returns grown up into a
lovely girl&mdash;whose pure soul, a very
devil would not dare to tarnish&mdash;she

<!-- page 101 col 1 -->

returns to bless the sight of her father&mdash;her
mother, with her laughing face and
she is&mdash;<i>dishonored!</i> I never knew
the meaning of the word till now&mdash;<i>dishonored</i>
by a villain&mdash;"</p>

<p>He flung himself on the sofa, and
covered his face with his hands.</p>

<p>"And yet I, I, wronged an innocent
girl, because she was my father's
servant! Great God! Can she,
have a brother to feel for her ruin?
My punishment is just, but Mary&mdash;Oh!
whom did she ever harm, whom
<i>could</i> she ever wrong?"</p>

<p>He was silent again. And while
his brain was tortured by the fierce
struggles of thought, while the memories
of earlier days came thronging
over his soul&mdash;the image of his sister,
present in every thought, and shining
brightest in each old-time memory&mdash;he
could feel, the grateful heat which
pervaded the atmosphere of the room,
restoring warmth and comfort to his
limbs, while his blood flowed more
freely in his veins.</p>

<p>There was a long pause, in which
his very soul was absorbed in a delirium
of thought. It may have been the
effect of internal agitation, or the result
of his half-crazed intellect acting
on his physical system, but after the
lapse of some few minutes, he was
aroused from his reverie, by a painful
throbbing around his temples, which
for a single moment destroyed all consciousness,
and just as suddenly restored
him to a keen and terrible sense
of his appalling situation. Now his
brain seemed to swim in a wild delirium,
and in a single instant as the
throbbing around his temples grew
more violent, his mental vision, seemed
clearer and more vigorous than ever.</p>

<!-- page 101 col 2 -->

<p>"I can scarcely breathe!" he muttered,
as he fell back on the sofa, after
a vain attempt to rise&mdash;"There is a
hand grasping me by the throat&mdash;I
feel the fingers clutching the veins,
with the grasp of a demon. My
heart&mdash;ah!&mdash;it is turning to ice&mdash;to
ice&mdash;and now it is fire! My heart is
a ball of flame&mdash;the blood boils in
my veins&mdash;"</p>

<p>He sprung to his feet, with a wild
bound and his hands clutched madly
at his throat, as though he would free
the veins from the grasp of the invisible
fingers, which were pressing
through the very skin.</p>

<p>He staggered to and fro along the
floor, with his arms flung overhead, as
if to ward off the attacks of some
invisible foe.</p>

<p>His face was ghastly pale, one moment;
the next it flushed with the
hues of a crimson flame. His large
black eyes dilated in their glance,
and stood out from the lids as though
they were about to fall from their sockets.
His mouth distended with a convulsive
grimace, while his teeth were
firmly clenched together. One instant
his brain would be perfectly conscious
in all its operations, the next
his senses would swim in a fearful delirium.</p>

<p>"My God&mdash;My God!" he shouted
in one of those momentary intervals
of consciousness, as he staggered
wildly along the floor&mdash;"I am dying&mdash;I
am dying! My breath comes
thick and gaspingly&mdash;my veins are
chilled&mdash;ha, ha&mdash;they are turned to
fire again&mdash;"</p>

<p>Even in his delirium he was conscious
of a singular circumstance. A
portion of the panelling of the false

<!-- page 102 col 1 -->

book-case, along the wall opposite the
fire, receded suddenly, within the sash
of the central glass-door, leaving a
space of black and vacant darkness.
The aperture was in the top of the
book-case, near the ceiling of the room.</p>

<p>Turning toward the hearth, Byrnewood
endeavored to regain the sofa,
but the room seemed swimming around
him, and with a wild movement, he
again staggered toward the book-case
opposite the fire.</p>

<p>He started backward as a new horror
met his gaze.</p>

<p>A hideous face glared upon him,
from the aperture of the book-case,
like some picture of a fiend's visage,
suddenly thrust against the glass-door
of the book-case.</p>

<p>A hideous face, with a single burning
eye, with a wide mouth distending
in a loathsome grin, with long rows
of fang-like teeth, and a protuberant
brow, overhung by thick masses of
matted hair. This face alone was
visible, surrounded by the darkness
which marked the square outline of
the aperture. It was, indeed, like a
hideous picture framed in ebony, although
you could see the muscles of
the face in motion, while the flat nose
was pressed against the glass of the
book-case, and the thick lips were now
tightly closed, and again distending in
hideous grin.</p>

<p>"Ho! ho! ho!" a laugh like the
shout of a devil, came echoing through
the glass, faint and subdued, yet wild
and terrible to hear&mdash;"The charcoal&mdash;the
charcoal! Wonder how <i>that 'ill
work!</i>"</p>

<p>Byrnewood stood silent and erect,
while the throbbing of his temples, the

<!-- page 102 col 2 -->

gasping of his breath, and the deadening
sensation around his heart, subsided
for a single moment.</p>

<p>The full horror of his situation
rushed upon him. He was dying by
the gas escaping from charcoal, in a
room, rendered impervious to the air;
closed and sealed for the purpose of
this horrible death.</p>

<p>A brilliant idea flashed across his
brain.</p>

<p>"I will overturn the furnace&mdash;"
he muttered, rushing toward the hearth&mdash;"I
will extinguish the flame!"</p>

<p>With a sudden bound he sprang
forward, but in the very action, fell to
the floor, like a drunken man.</p>

<p>His breath came in thick convulsive
gasps, his heart grew like a mass
of fire, while his brain was tortured by
one intense and agonizing throb of
pain, as though some invisible hand
had wound a red hot wire round his
forehead. He lay on the floor, with
his outspread hands grasping the air
in the effort to rise.</p>

<p>"It works, it works!" shouted the
voice of Devil-Bug, as his loathsome
countenance was pressed against the
glass-door of the book-case&mdash;"Ha!
ha! ha! He is on the floor&mdash;he
cannot rise&mdash;he is in the clutch of
death. How the poor feller kicks and
scuffles!"</p>

<p>A wild, wild shriek echoing from a
distant room came faintly to Byrnewood's
ear. That sound of a woman's
voice, shrieking for help, in an emphasis
of despair, aroused the dying
man from the spell which began to
deaden his senses.</p>

<p>"It is my sister's voice!" he exclaimed,
springing to his feet with a

<!-- page 103 col 1 -->

last effort of strength&mdash;"She is in the
hands of the villain! I will save her&mdash;I
will save her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The sister outraged! The brother
murdered!" shouted Devil-Bug,
through the glass-door&mdash;"I wonder
how <i>that 'ill work!</i>"</p>

<p>Byrnewood rushed towards the
door; it was locked and secured. All
hope was in vain. He must die. Die,
while his sister's shriek for aid rang
on his ears, die, with the loathsome
face of his murderer pressed against
the glass, while his blazing eye feasted
on his last convulsive agonies, die,
with youth on his brow, with health
in his heart! Die, with all purposed
vengeance on his sister's wronger unfulfilled;
die, by no sudden blow, by
no dagger thrust, by no pistol shot,
but by the most loathsome of all
deaths, by suffocation.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" the thought flashed
over his brain&mdash;"The hangman's
rope were a priceless luxury to me in
this dread hour!"</p>

<p>Staggering slowly along the floor,
with footsteps as heavy as though he
had leaden weights attached to his
feet, he approached the chest-like table,
and with a faint effort to recover
his balance, sunk down on the floor,
in a crouching position, while his outspread
hands clutched faintly at the
air.</p>

<p>In a moment he rolled slowly from
side to side, and lay on his back with
his face to the ceiling, and his arms
extended on either side. His eyes
were suddenly covered with a glassy
film, his lower jaw separated from the
upper, leaving his mouth wide open,
while the room grew warmer, the air
more dense and suffocating.</p>

<!-- page 103 col 2 -->

<p>"Help&mdash;help!" murmured Byrnewood,
in a smothered voice, like the
sound produced by a man throttled by
nightmare&mdash;"Help! help!"</p>

<p>" 'By-a-baby, go to sleep'&mdash;that's
a good feller&mdash;" the voice of Devil-Bug
came like a faint echo through
the glass&mdash;"A drop from the bottle
'ud do you good, and&mdash;jist reach
your right hand a leetle bit further!
There ain't no spring there, I <i>sup</i>-pose!
Ain't there? Ho-ho-ho!"</p>

<p>And Byrnewood could feel a delicious
languor stealing over his frame,
as he lay there on the floor, helpless
and motionless, while the voice of
Devil-Bug rang in his ears. The
throbbing of his temples had subsided,
he no more experienced the quick
gasping struggle for breath, his heart
no more passed through the quick
transitions from cold to heat, from ice
to fire, his veins no more felt like
streams of molten lead. He was sinking
quietly in a soft and pleasing
slumber. The film grew more glassy
in each eye, his jaws hung further
apart, and the heaving of his chest
subsided, until a faint and tremulous
motion, was the only indication that
life had not yet fled from his frame.
His outspread arms seemed to grow
stiffened and dead as he rested on the
floor, while the joints of the fingers
moved faintly to and fro, with a fluttering
motion, that afforded a strange
contrast to the complete repose of his
body and limbs. His feet were pointed
upward, like the feet of a corpse, arrayed
for burial.</p>

<p>The dim light burning on the chest-like
table, afforded a faint light to the
ghastly scene. There were the untouched
refreshments, the cold chicken

<!-- page 104 col 1 -->

and the bottle of wine, giving the
place the air of a quiet supper-room,
there were the false book-cases, indicating
a resort for meditation and study,
there was the cheerful furnace, its
glowing flame flashing through the
half-closed doors, speaking a pleasant
tale of fireside joys and comforts, and
there, along the carpet, stiffening and
ghastly lay the form of Byrnewood
Arlington, slowly and quietly yielding
to the slumber of death, while a
hideous face peered through the glass-door,
all distorted by a sickening
grimace, and a solitary eye, that
gleamed like a live coal, drank in the
tremulous agonies of the dying man.</p>

<p>"Reach his hand a leetle bit further
that's a good feller. Won't have
no tumble down three stories, nor
nothin', if his fingers touch the spring?
Ho-ho! Quiet now, I guess. Jist
look how his fingers tremble&mdash;He!
he! he! Hallo! He's on his feet
agin!"</p>

<p>With the last involuntary struggle
of a strong man wrestling for his life,
Byrnewood Arlington sprang to his
feet, and reaching forth his hand with
the same mechanical impulse that had
raised him from the floor, he seized the
bottle of wine; he raised it to his lips,
and the wine poured gurgling down
his throat.</p>

<p>"Hain't got no opium in, I <i>sup</i>-pose?
Not the least mossel. Cuss it,
how he staggers! Believe my soul
he's comin' to life agin&mdash;"</p>

<p>Byrnewood glanced around with a
look of momentary consciousness.
The drugged wine, for a single moment,
created a violent re-action in
his system, and he became fully sensible
of the awful death that awaited

<!-- page 104 col 2 -->

him. He could feel the hot air, warming
his cheek, he could see the visage
of Devil-Bug peering at him through the
glass-door, and the danger which menaced
his sister, came home like some
horrible phantom to his soul. He felt
in his very soul that but a single moment
more of consciousness, would be
permitted him, for action. That moment
past, and the death by charcoal,
would be quietly and surely accomplished.</p>

<p>"Keep me, oh Heaven!" he whispered
as his mind ran over various expedients
for escape&mdash;"Aid me, in this,
my last effort, that I may live to
avenge my sister's dishonor!"</p>

<p>It was his design to make one sudden
and desperate spring toward the glass-door,
through which the hideous visage
of Devil-Bug, glared in his face
and as he madly dashed his hands
through the glass, the room would be
filled with a current of fresh air.</p>

<p>This was his resolve, but it came
too late. As he turned, to make this
desperate spring, his heel pressed
against an object, rising from the floor,
near a corner of the chest-like table.
It was but a small object, resembling
a nail or spike, which has not been
driven to the head, in the planking of
a floor, but suffered to remain half-exposed
and open to the view.</p>

<p>And yet the very moment Byrnewood's
heel, pressed against the trifling
object, the floor on which he stood gave
way beneath him, with a low rustling
sound, half of the Chamber was changed
into one black and yawning chasm,
and the lamp standing on the table suddenly
disappeared, leaving the place
wrapt in thick darkness.</p>

<p>Another moment passed, and while

<!-- page 105 col 1 -->

Byrnewood reeled in the darkness, on
the verge of the sunken trap-door, a
hushed and distant sound, echoed far
below as from the depths of some
deep and dismal well. The lamp had
fallen in the chasm, and the faint sound
heard far, far below was the only indication
that it had reached the bottom
of the gloomy void, sinking down
like a well into the cellars of Monk-Hall.</p>

<p>Byrnewood tottered on the verge of
the chasm, while a current of cold air
came sweeping upward from its depths.
The foul atmosphere of the Tower
Room, lost half its deadly qualities,
in a single moment, as the cool air,
came rushing from the chasm.</p>

<p>Byrnewood felt the effects of the
charcoal rapidly passing from his system,
and his mind regained its full
consciousness as his hot brow, received
the freshening blast of winter air,
pouring over the parched and heated
skin.</p>

<p>But the current of pure air, came
too late for his salvation. Tottering
in the darkness on the very verge of
the sunken trap-door, he made one desperate
struggle to preserve his balance,
but in vain. For a moment his form
swung to and fro, and then his feet
slid from under him; and then with
a maddening shriek, he fell.</p>

<p>"God save poor Mary!"</p>

<p>How that last cry of the doomed
man shrieked around the panelled
walls of the Tower Room!</p>

<p>"Wonder how <i>that</i>'ill <i>work!</i>" the
hoarse voice of Devil-Bug, shrieked
through the darkness&mdash;"Down&mdash;down&mdash;<i>down!</i>
Ah-ha! Three
stories&mdash;down&mdash;down&mdash;down! I
wonders how that 'ill work!"</p>

<!-- page 105 col 2 -->

<p>Separated from the Tower Room by
the glass-door, Devil-Bug pressed his
ear against the glass, and listened for
the death-groans of the doomed man.</p>

<p>A low moaning sound, like the
groan of a man, who trembles under
the operations of a surgeon's knife,
came faintly to his ear. In a moment,
Devil-Bug, thought he heard a sound
like a door suddenly opened, and then,
the murmur of voices, whispering
some quick and hurried words, resounded
along the Tower Room.
Then there was a subdued noise,
like a man struggling on the brink
of the chasm, and then a hushed
sound, that might have been taken
for the tread of a footstep mingled
with the closing of a door, came faintly
through the glass of the book-case.</p>

<p>Gliding silently from the secret recess,
behind the panelling of the
Tower Room, Devil-Bug stepped over
the forms of the slumbering negroes
and descended the stairway leading to
the Walnut Room. The scene of the
wedding was wrapt in midnight darkness.
Passing softly along the floor,
Devil-Bug, reached the entrance to the
Rose Chamber, and flung the hangings
aside, with a cautious movement
of his talon-like fingers.</p>

<p>"I merely wanted a light&mdash;" exclaimed
Devil-Bug, as he stood gazing
into the Rose Chamber&mdash;"But here's
a candle, and a purty sight into the
bargain!"</p>

<p>He disappeared through the doorway,
and after the lapse of a few moments,
again emerged into the Walnut
Room, holding a lighted candle in his
hand.</p>

<p>"Amazin' circumstance, <i>that</i>&mdash;"
he chuckled, as he strode across the

<!-- page 106 col 1 -->

glittering floor&mdash;"The brother <i>fell</i> in
that 'are room, and the sister <i>fell</i> in
<i>that</i>; about the same time. They <i>fell</i>
in different ways though. Strange
world, this. Let's see what become
of the brother&mdash;Charcoal and opium&mdash;ho!
ho! ho!"</p>

<p>Before another moment had elapsed,
he stood before the door of Tower
Room. Musquito and Glow-worm
still slumbered on their watch, their
huge forms and hideous faces, dimly
developed in the beams of the light,
which the Doorkeeper carried in his
hand. Devil-Bug listened intently for
a single moment, but not the slightest
sound disturbed the silence of the
Tower room.</p>

<p>He opened the door, he strode along
the carpet, he stood on the verge of
the chasm, produced by the falling of
the death-trap.</p>

<p>"Down&mdash;down! Three stories,
and the pit below! Ha! Let me
hold the light, a leetle nearer! Every
trap-door is open&mdash;he is safe enough!
Think I see suffin' white a-flutterin'
a-way down there! Hollered pretty
loud as he fell&mdash;devilish ugly tumble!
Guess it 'ill work quite nice for Lorrimer!"</p>

<p>Stooping on his knees with the light
extended in his right hand, he again
gazed down the hatchway, his solitary
eye flashing with excitement, as he
endeavored to pierce the gloom of
the dark void beneath.</p>

<p>"He's gone to see his friends below!
Sartin sure! No sound&mdash;no
groan&mdash;not even a holler!"</p>

<p>Arising from his kneeling position,
Devil-Bug approached the recess of
the fire-place. On either side, a plain

<!-- page 106 col 2 -->

panel of oak, concealed the secret
nook behind the false book-case.
Placing his hand cautiously along the
panel to the right, Devil-Bug examined
the details of the carving in each
corner, and along its side, with a careful
eye.</p>

<p>"Hasn't been opened to-night&mdash;"
he murmured&mdash;"Leads to the Walnut
Room, by a round-a-bout way.
Convenient little passage, if that fool
had only knowed on it!"</p>

<p>In an instant he stood outside of the
Tower Room door, holding the key in
one hand, and the candlestick in the
other.</p>

<p>"Git up you lazy d&mdash;ls!" he
shouted, bestowing a few pointed
kicks upon the carcases of the sleeping
negroes&mdash;"Git up and mind your
eyes, or else I'll pick 'em out o' your
head to play marbles with&mdash;"</p>

<p>Glow-worm arose slowly from the
floor, and Musquito, opening his eyes
with a sleepy yawn, stared vacantly
in the Doorkeeper's face.</p>

<p>"D'ye hear me? Watch this feller
and see that he don't escape?
He's a sleepin' now, but there's no
knowin'&mdash;Watch! I say watch!"</p>

<p>He shuffled slowly along the narrow
passage, looking over his shoulder
at the grinning negroes, as he passed
along, while his face wore its usual
pleasant smile, as he again muttered
in his hoarse tones&mdash;"Watch him ye
dogs&mdash;I say watch him!"</p>

<p>Another moment, and he stood before
the entrance of the Rose Chamber,
holding the curtaining aside,
while his eye blazed up with an expression
of malignant joy. He raised
the light on high, and stood gazing
silently through the doorway, as

<!-- page 107 col 1 -->

though his eye beheld a spectacle of
strange and peculiar interest.</p>

<p>And while he stood there, chuckling
pleasantly to himself, with the full
light of the candle, flashing over his
loathsome face, two figures, stood
crouching in the darkness, along the
opposite side of the room, and the
eastern door hung slightly ajar, as
though they had entered the place but
a moment before.</p>

<p>Once or twice Devil-Bug turned, as
though the sound of suppressed breathing
struck his ear, but every time, the
shadow of the candle fell along the opposite
side of the room, and the crouching
figures were concealed from view.</p>

<p>"Quite a pictur'&mdash;" chuckled
Devil-Bug as he again gazed through
the doorway of the Rose Chamber&mdash;"A
nice little gal and a handsome
feller! Ha! Ha! Ha!"</p>

<p>He disappeared through the curtaining,
while his pleasant chuckle
came echoing through the doorway,
with a sound of continued glee, as
though the gentleman was highly
amused by the spectacle that broke on
his gaze.</p>

<p>The silence of the Rose Chamber
was broken by the tread of a footstep
and the figure of a man, came stealing
through the darkness, with the
form of a queenly woman by his side.</p>

<p>"Advance&mdash;and save your sister's
honor&mdash;" the deep-toned whisper
broke thrillingly on the air.</p>

<p>The man advanced with a hurried
step, flung the curtain hastily aside,
and gazed within the Rose Chamber.</p>

<p>The horror of that silent gaze,
would be ill-repayed by an Eternity
of joy.</p>

<p>CHAPTER THIRTEENTH.</p>

<p class="small">THE CRIME WITHOUT A NAME.</p>

</div>

<p>"MY brother consents? Oh joy,
Lorraine&mdash;he consents!"</p>

<p>"Your brother consents to our wedding,
my love&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How did he first discover, that the
wedding was to take place to-night?"</p>

<p>"It seems that for several days, he
has noticed you walking out with Bess.
You see, Mary, this excited his suspicions.
He watched you with all a
brother's care, and to-night, tracked
Bess and you, to the doors of this
mansion. He was not certain however,
that it was <i>you</i>, whom he seen,
enter my uncle's house&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And so he watched all night around
the building? Oh Lorraine, <i>he</i> is a
noble brother!"</p>

<p>"At last, grown feverish with his
suspicions, he rung the bell, aroused
the servant, and when the door was
opened, rushed madly up stairs, and
reached the Wedding Room. You
know the rest. After the matter was
explained to him, he consented to keep
our marriage secret until Christmas
Eve. He has left the house, satisfied
that you are in the care of those who
love you. To-morrow, Mary, when
you have recovered from the effects
of the surprise,&mdash;which your brother's
sudden entrance occasioned&mdash;to-morrow
we will be married!"</p>

<p>"And on Christmas Eve, hand linked
in hand, we will kneel before <i>our</i>
father, and ask his blessing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One kiss, Mary love, one kiss,
and I will leave you for the night&mdash;"</p>

<p>And leaning fondly over the fair
girl, who was seated on the sofa, her

<!-- page 108 col 1 -->

form enveloped in a flowing night-robe,
Lorrimer wound his right arm gently
around her neck, bending her head
slowly backward in the action, and
suffering her rich curls to fall showering
on her shoulders, while her upturned
face, all radiant with affection
lay open to his burning gaze, and her
ripe lips, dropped slightly apart, disclosing
the ivory teeth, seemed to woo
and invite the pressure of his kiss.</p>

<p>One kiss, silent and long, and the
Lover and the fair girl, seemed to have
grown to each other's lips.</p>

<p>The wax-light standing on the
small table of the Rose Chamber, fell
mild and dimly over this living picture
of youth and passion.</p>

<p>The tall form of Lorrimer, clad in
solemn black, contrasting forcibly
with the snow-white robes of the Maiden,
his arm flung gently around her
neck, her upturned face half-hidden by
the falling locks of his dark brown
hair, their lips joined and their eyes
mingling in the same deep glance of
passion, while her bosom rose heaving
against his breast, and her arms half-upraised
seemed about to entwine his
form in their embrace&mdash;it was a moment
of pure and hallowed love on the
part of the fair girl, and even the libertine,
for an instant forgot the vileness
of his purpose, in that long and
silent kiss of stainless passion.</p>

<p>"Mary!" cried Lorrimer, his hand
some face flushing over with transport,
as silently gliding from his standing
position, he assumed his seat at her
side&mdash;"Oh! would that you were
mine! We would flee together from

<!-- page 108 col 2 -->

the heartless world&mdash;in some silent
and shadowy valley, we would forget
all, but the love which made us one."</p>

<p>"We would seek a home, quiet and
peaceful, as that which this book describes&mdash;"
whispered Mary laying
her hand on Bulwer's play of Claude
Mellnotte&mdash;"I found the volume
on the table, and was reading it, when
you came in. Oh, it is all beauty and
feeling. You have read it Lorraine?"</p>

<p>"Again and again and have seen it
played a hundred times.&mdash;'The home,
to which love could fulfil its prayers,
this hand would lead thee'&mdash;" he
murmured repeating the first lines of
the celebrated description of the Lake
of Como&mdash;"And yet Mary this is
mere romance. A creation of the
poet's brain. A fiction as beautiful as
a ray of light; and as fleeting. I
might tell you a story of a real
valley and a real lake,&mdash;which I beheld
last summer&mdash;where love might
dwell forever, and dwell in eternal
youth and freshness.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh tell me&mdash;tell me&mdash;"cried
Mary, gazing in his face with a look
of interest.</p>

<p>"Beyond the fair valley of Wyoming,
of which so much has been
said and sung, there is a high and extensive
range of mountains, covered
with thick and gloomy forests. One
day last September when the summer
was yet in its freshness and bloom,
toward the hour of sunset, I found
myself wandering through a thick
wood, that covered the summit of one
of the highest of these mountains. I
had been engaged in a deer-hunt all
day&mdash;had strayed from my comrades&mdash;and
now as night was coming

<!-- page 109 col 1 -->

on, was wandering, along a winding
path, that led to the top of the
mountain&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lorrimer paused for a single instant,
and gazed intently in Mary's face.
Every feature was animated with sudden
interest and a warm flush, hung
freshly on each cheek.</p>

<p>And as Lorrimer gazed upon the
animated face of the innocent girl,
marking its rounded outlines, its hues
of youth and loveliness, its large blue
eyes beaming so gladly upon his
countenance, the settled purpose of his
soul, came home to him, like a sudden
shadow darkening over a landscape,
after a single gleam of sunlight.</p>

<p>It was the purpose of this libertine
to dishonor the stainless girl, before he
left her presence.</p>

<p>Before daybreak she would be a polluted
thing, whose name and virtue and
soul, would be blasted forever.</p>

<p>In that silent gaze, which drank in the
beauty of the maiden's face, Lorrimer
arranged his plan of action. The book
which he had left upon the table, the story
which he was about to tell, were the
first intimations of his atrocious design.
While enchaining the mind of the
Maiden, with a story full of Romance,
it was his intention to wake her animal
nature into full action. And when
her veins were all alive with fiery pulsations,
when her heart grew animate
with sensual life, when her eyes swam
in the humid moisture of passion,
then she would sink helplessly into his
arms, and&mdash;like the bird to the snake,&mdash;flutter
to her ruin.</p>

<p>" 'Force'&mdash;'violence!' These are
but the tools of grown-up children,
who know nothing of the mystery of
woman's heart&mdash;" the thought flashed

<!-- page 109 col 2 -->

over Lorrimer's brain, as his lip,
wore a very slight but meaning smile&mdash;"I
have deeper means, than these!
I employ neither force, nor threats,
nor fraud, nor violence! My victim
is the instrument of her own ruin&mdash;without
one rude grasp from my hand,
without one threatening word, she swims
willingly to my arms!"</p>

<p>He took the hand of the fair girl
within his own, and looking her steadily
in the eye, with a deep gaze
which every instant grew more vivid
and burning, he went on with his story&mdash;and
his design.</p>

<p>"The wood grew very dark. Around
me, were massive trees with
thick branches, and gnarled trunks,
bearing witness of the storms of an
hundred years. My way led over a
path covered with soft forest-moss,
and now and then, red gleams of sunlight
shot like arrows of gold, between
the overhanging leaves. Darker and
darker, the twilight sank down upon
the forest. At last missing the path,
I knew not which way to tread. All
was dark and indistinct. Now falling
over a crumbling limb, which had
been thrown down by a storm long before,
now entangled by the wild vines,
that overspread portions of the ground,
and now missing my foothold in some
hidden crevice of the earth, I wandered
wearily on. At last climbing up a
sudden elevation of the mountain, I
stood upon a vast rock, that hung over
the depths below, like an immense
platform. On all sides, but one, this
rock was encircled by a waving wall
of forest-leaves. Green shrubs swept
circling around, enclosing it like a
fairy bower, while the eastern side,
lay open to the beams of the moon,

<!-- page 110 col 1 -->

which now rose grandly in the vast
horizon. Far over wood, far over
mountain, far over ravine and dell
this platform-rock, commanded a distant
view of the valley of Wyoming.</p>

<p>"The moon was in the sky, Mary;
the sky was one vast sheet of blue,
undimmed by a single cloud; and beneath
the moonbeams lay a sea of forest-leaves,
while in the dim distance&mdash;like the shore of this leafy ocean&mdash;arose
the roofs and steeples of a
quiet town, with a broad river, rolling
along the dark valley, like a banner of
silver, flung over a sable-pall&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How beautiful!"</p>

<p>And as the murmur escaped Mary's
lips, the hand of Lorrimer grew closer
in its pressure, while his left arm,
wound gently around her waist.</p>

<p>"I stood entranced by the sight. A
cool breeze came up the mountain side,
imparting a grateful freshness to my
cheek. The view was indeed beautiful,
but I suddenly remembered that
I was without resting-place or shelter.
Ignorant of the mountain paths, afar
from any farm-house or village, I had
still a faint of hope, of discovering the
temporary habitation of some hunter,
who had encamped in these forest-wilds.</p>

<p>"I turned from the magnificent
prospect&mdash;I brushed aside the wall of
leaves, I looked to the western sky.
I shall never forget the view&mdash;which
like a dream of fairy-land&mdash;burst on
my sight, as pushing the shrubbery
aside, I gazed from the western limits
of the platform-rock.</p>

<p>"There, below me, imbedded in the
very summit of the mountain, lay a
calm lake, whose crystal-waters, gave
back the reflection of forest and sky,

<!-- page 110 col 2 -->

like an immense mirror. It was but
a mile in length, and half that distance
in width. On all sides, sudden and
steep, arose the encircling wall of forest
trees. Like wine in a goblet, that
calm sheet of water, lay in the embrace
of the surrounding wall of foliage.
The waters were clear, so
tranquil, that I could see, down, down,
far, far beneath, as if another world,
was hidden in their depths. And then
from the heights, the luxuriant foliage,
as yet untouched by autumn, sank in
waves of verdure to the very brink of
the lake, the trembling leaves, dipping
in the clear, cold waters, with a gentle
motion. It was very beautiful
Mary and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, most beautiful!"</p>

<p>The left hand of Lorrimer, gently
stealing round her form, rested with a
faint pressure upon the folds of the
night-robe, over her bosom, which now
came heaving tremulously into light.</p>

<p>"I looked upon this lovely lake
with a keen delight. I gazed upon the
tranquil waters, upon the steeps
crowned with forest-trees&mdash;one side
in heavy shadow, the other, gleaming
in the advancing moonbeams&mdash;I
seemed to inhale the quietness, the solitude
of the place, as a holy influence,
mingling with the very air, I breathed,
and a wild transport aroused my soul
into an outburst of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;I cried&mdash;is the home for
Love! Love, pure and stainless, flying
from the crowded city, here can
repose, beneath the shadow of quiet
rocks, beside the gleam of tranquil
waters, within the solitudes of endless
forests. Yon sky, so clear, so cloudless,
has never beheld a sight of human
misery or wo. Yon lake, sweeping

<!-- page 111 col 1 -->

beneath me, like another sky, has
never been crimsoned by human blood.
This quiet valley, hidden from the
world now, as it has been hidden since
the creation, is but another world
where two hearts that love, that mingle
in one, that throb but for each other's
joy, can dwell forever, in the calm silence
of unalloyed affection&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A home for love such as angels
feel&mdash;"</p>

<p>Closer and more close, the hand of
Lorrimer pressed against the heaving
bosom, with but the slight folds of the
night-robe between.</p>

<p>"Here, beside this calm lake, whenever
the love of a true woman shall
be mine, here, afar from the cares and
realities of life, will I dwell! Here,
with the means which the accident of
fortune has bestowed, will I build, not
a temple, not a mansion, not a palace!
But a cottage, a quiet home, whose
roof shall arise&mdash;like a dear hope in
the wilderness&mdash;from amid the green
leaves of embowering trees&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You spoke thus, Lorraine? Do
I not love you as a true woman should
love? Is not your love calm and
stainless as the waters of the mountain
lake? We will dwell there, Lorraine!
Oh, how like romance will be
the plain reality of our life!"</p>

<p>"Oh! Mary, my own true love, in
that moment as I stood gazing upon
the world-hidden lake, my heart all
throbbing with strange impulses, my
very soul steeped in a holy calm,
your form seemed to glide between my
eyes and the moonlight! The thought
rushed like a prophecy over my soul,
that one day, amid the barren wilderness
of hearts, which crowd the world,
I should find <i>one, one</i> heart, whose

<!-- page 111 col 2 -->

impulses should be stainless, whose affection
should be undying, whose love
should be mine! Oh, Mary, in that
moment, I felt that my life would, one
day, be illumined by your love&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And then you knew me not? Oh,
Lorraine, is there not a strange mystery
in this affection, which makes the
heart long for the love, which it shall
one day experience, even before the
eye has seen the beloved one?"</p>

<p>Brighter grew the glow on her
cheek, closer pressed the hand on her
bosom, warmer and higher arose that
bosom in the light.</p>

<p>"And there, Mary, in that quiet
mountain valley, we will seek a home,
when we are married. As soon as
summer comes, when the trees are
green, and the flowers burst from
among the moss along the wood-path,
we will hasten to the mountain lake,
and dwell within the walls of our
quiet home. For a home shall be
reared for us, Mary, on a green glade
that slopes down to the water's brink,
with the tall trees sweeping away on
either side.</p>

<p>"A quiet little cottage, Mary, with
a sloping roof and small windows, all
fragrant with wild flowers and forest
vines! A garden before the door,
Mary, where, in the calm summer
morning, you can inhale the sweetness
of the flowers, as they breath forth in
untamed luxuriance. And then, anchored
by the shore, Mary, a light
sail-boat will be ready for us ever; to
bear us over the clear lake in the
early dawn, when the mist winds
up in fleecy columns to the sky, or
in the twilight, when the red sun
flings his last ray over the waters,
or in the silent night, when the moon

<!-- page 112 col 1 -->

is up, and the stars look kindly on us
from the cloudless sky&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Alas! Lorraine! Clouds may
come and storms, and winter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What care we for winter, when
eternal spring is in our hearts! Let
winter come with its chill, and its ice
and its snows! Beside our cheerful
fire, Mary, with our hands clasping
some book, whose theme is the trials
of two hearts that loved on through
difficulty and danger or death, we will
sit silently, our hearts throbbing with
one delight, while the long hours
of the winter evening glide quietly
on. Do you see the fire, Mary?
How cheerily its beams light our
faces as we sit in its kindly light!
My arm is round your waist, Mary,
my cheek is laid next to yours, our
hands are locked together and your
heart, Mary, oh how softly its throbbings
fall on my ear!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lorraine! Why is there any
care in the world, when two hearts
can make such a heaven on earth,
with the holy lessons of an all-trusting
love&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or it may be, Mary&mdash;" and his
gaze grew deeper, while his voice
sank to a low and thrilling whisper&mdash;"Or
it may be, Mary, that while we
sit beside our winter fire&mdash;a fair babe&mdash;do
not blush, <i>my wife</i>&mdash;a fair babe
will rest smiling on your bosom&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lorraine&mdash;" she murmured,
and hid her face upon his breast, her
long brown tresses, covering her neck
and shoulders like a veil, while Lorrimer wound his arms closely round
her form, and looked around with a
glance full of meaning.</p>

<p>There was triumph in that glance.
The libertine felt her heart throbbing

<!-- page 112 col 2 -->

against his breast as he held her in his
arms, he felt her bosom panting and
heaving, and quivering with a quick
fluttering pulsation and as he swept
the clustering curls aside from her
half-hidden face, he saw that her cheek
glowed like a new-lighted flame.</p>

<p>"She is mine!" he thought, and a
smile of triumph gave a dark aspect
to his handsome face.</p>

<p>In a moment Mary raised her glowing
countenance from his breast. She
gazed around, with a timid, frightened
look. Her breath came thick and
gaspingly. Her cheeks were all
a-glow, her blue eyes swam in a hazy
dimness. She felt as though she was
about to fall swooning on the floor.
For a moment all consciousness
seemed to have failed her, while a delirious
languor came stealing over her
senses. Lorrimer's form seemed to
swim in the air before her, and the
dim light of the room gave place to a
flood of radiance, which seemed all at
once to pour on her eyesight from
some invisible source. Soft murmurs,
like voices heard in a pleasant dream,
fell gently on her ears, the languor
came deeper and more mellow over
her limbs; her bosom rose no longer
quick and gaspingly, but in long pulsations,
that urged the full globes in
all their virgin beauty, softly and
slowly into view. Like billows they
rose above the folds of the night robe,
while the flush grew warmer on her
cheek, and her parted lips deepened
into a rich vermilion tint.</p>

<p>"She is mine!" and the same dark
smile flushed over Lorrimer's face.
Silent and motionless he sat, regarding
his victim with a steadfast glance.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lorraine&mdash;" she cried, in a

<!-- page 113 col 1 -->

gasping voice, as she felt a strange
unconsciousness stealing over her
senses&mdash;"Oh, Lorraine&mdash;save me&mdash;save
me!"</p>

<p>She arose, tottering on her feet,
flinging her hands aloft, as though
she stood on the brink of some frightful
steep, without the power to retreat
from its crumbling edge.</p>

<p>"There is no danger for you, my
Mary&mdash;" whispered Lorrimer, as he
received her falling form in his outspread
arms&mdash;"There is no danger
for you, my Mary&mdash;"</p>

<p>He played with the glossy curls of
her dark brown hair as he spoke,
while his arms gathered her half-swooning
form full against his heart.</p>

<p>"She is mine! Her blood is
a-flame&mdash;her senses swim in a delirium
of passion! While the story fell
from my lips, I aroused her slumbering
woman's nature. Talk of force&mdash;ha,
ha&mdash;She rests on my bosom
as though she would grow there&mdash;"</p>

<p>As these thoughts half escaped
from his lips, in a muttered whisper,
his face shone with the glow of sensual
passion, while his hazel eye dilated, with a glance, whose intense
lustre had but one meaning; dark and
atrocious.</p>

<p>She lay on his breast, her senses
wrapt in a feverish swoon, that laid her
powerless in his arms, while it left her
mind vividly sensible of the approaching
danger.</p>

<p>"Mary, my love&mdash;no danger
threatens you&mdash;" he whispered playing
with her glossy curls&mdash;"Look
up, my love&mdash;<i>I</i> am with you, and
will shield you from harm!"</p>

<p>Gathering her form in his left arm,
secure of his victim, he raised her

<!-- page 113 col 2 -->

from his breast, and fixing his gaze
upon her blue eyes, humid with moisture,
he slowly flung back the night
robe from her shoulders. Her bosom,
in all its richness of outline, heaving
and throbbing with that long pulsation,
which urged it upward like a billow,
lay open to his gaze.</p>

<p>And at the very moment, that her
fair breast was thrown open to his sensual
gaze, she sprang from his embrace,
with a wild shriek, and instinctively
gathered her robe over her
bosom, with a trembling movement
of her fair white hands. The touch
of the seducer's hand, polluting her
stainless bosom, had restored her to
sudden consciousness.</p>

<p>"Lorraine! Lorraine!" she shrieked,
retreating to the farthest corner of
the room&mdash;"Oh, save me&mdash;save
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No danger threatens you, my
Mary&mdash;"</p>

<p>He advanced, as he spoke, towards
the trembling girl, who had shrunk
into a corner of the room, crouching
closely to the rose-hued hangings,
while with her head turned over her
shoulder and her hands clasped across
her bosom, she gazed around with a
glance full of terror and alarm.</p>

<p>Lorrimer advanced toward the
crouching girl. He had been sure
of his victim; he did not dream of
any sudden outburst of terror from
the half swooning maiden as she lay,
helpless on his breast. As he advanced,
a change came over his appearance.
His face grew purple, and
the veins of his eyes filled with thick
red blood. He trembled as he walked
across the floor, and his chest heaved

<!-- page 114 col 1 -->

and throbbed beneath his white vest,
as though he found it difficult to
breathe.</p>

<p>God save poor Mary, now!</p>

<p>Looking over her shoulder, she
caught a gleam of his blood-shot eye,
and read her ruin there.</p>

<p>"Mary, there is no danger&mdash;" he
muttered, in a husky voice, as she
shrunk back from his touch&mdash;"Let
me raise you from the floor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Save me, oh Lorraine&mdash;Save
me!" she cried, in a voice of terror,
crouching closer to the hangings along
the wall.</p>

<p>"From what shall I save you?"
he whispered, in a voice unnaturally
soft and gentle, as though he endeavored
to hide the rising anger
which began to gleam from his eye,
when he found himself foiled in
the very moment of triumph&mdash;"From
what shall I save you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"From yourself&mdash;" she shrieked,
in a frightened tone&mdash;"Oh, Lorraine,
you love me. You will not harm me.
Oh, save me, save me from yourself!"</p>

<p>Playing with the animal nature of
the stainless girl, Lorrimer had aroused
the sensual volcano of his own base
heart. While he pressed her hand,
while he gazed in her eyes, while he
wound his embrace around her form,
he had anticipated a certain and grateful
conquest. He had not dreamed
that the humid eye, the heaving bosom,
the burning cheek of Mary Arlington,
were aught but the signs of his coming
triumph. Resistance? Prayers? Tears?
He had not anticipated these. The
fiend was up in his soul. The libertine
had gone too far to recede.</p>

<p>He stood before the crouching girl,
a fearful picture of incarnate LUST.

<!-- page 114 col 2 -->

Sudden as the shadow after the light
this change had passed over his soul.
His form arose towering and erect, his
chest throbbed with sensual excitement,
his hands hung, madly clenched,
by his side, while his curling hair fell
wild and disordered over his brows,
darkening in a hideous frown, and his
mustachioed lip wore the expression
of his fixed and unalterable purpose.
His blood-shot eyes, flashed with the
unholy light of passion, as he stood
sternly surveying the form of his
victim. There was something wild
and brutal in their savage glare.</p>

<p>"This is all folly&mdash;" he said, in
that low toned and husky voice&mdash;"Rise
from the floor, Mary. You
don't think I'd harm you?"</p>

<p>He stooped to raise her from the
floor, but she shrank from his extended
hands as though there was pollution
in his slightest touch.</p>

<p>"Mary, I wish you to rise from the
floor!"</p>

<p>His clenched hands trembled as he
spoke, and the flush of mingled anger
and sensual feeling, deepened over his
face.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lorraine!" she cried, flinging
herself on her knees before him&mdash;"Oh,
Lorraine&mdash;you will not harm
<i>me?</i> This is not <i>you</i>, Lorraine; it cannot
be <i>you</i>. You would not look
darkly on me, your voice would not
grow harsh as it whispered my name&mdash;It
is not Lorraine that I see&mdash;it
is an evil spirit&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was an evil spirit, she said, and
yet looked up into his blood-shot eyes
for a gleam of mercy as she spoke,
and with her trembling fingers, wrung
his clenched right hand, and clasped
it wildly to her bosom.</p>

<!-- page 115 col 1 -->

<p>Pure, stainless, innocent, her heart
a heaven of love, her mind child-like
in its knowledge of the World, she
knew not what she feared. She did
not fear the shame which the good
world would heap upon her, she did
not fear the Dishonor, because it would
be followed by such pollution that, no
man in honor might call her&mdash;Wife&mdash;no
child in innocence might whisper
her name as&mdash;Mother&mdash;she did not
fear the foul Wrong, as society with
its million tongues and eyes, fears it,
and holds it in abhorrence, ever visiting
the guilt of the man upon the head
of his trembling victim.</p>

<p>Mary feared the Dishonor, because
her soul, with some strange consciousness
of approaching evil, deemed it,
a foul Spirit, who had arisen, not so
much to visit her with wrong as to
destroy the Love, she felt for Lorrimer.
Not for herself, but for <i>his</i> sake, she
feared that nameless crime, which already
glared upon her from the blood-shot
eyes of her Lover. Her <i>Lover!</i></p>

<p>"Oh, Lorraine, you will not harm
me! For the sake of God, save me&mdash;save
me!"</p>

<p>She clasped his hand with a closer
grasp and gathered it tremblingly to
her bosom, while her eyes dilating
with a glance of terror, were fixed
upon his face.</p>

<p>"Mary&mdash;this is madness&mdash;nothing
but madness&mdash;" he said in that
voice, grown hoarse with passion, and
rudely tore his hand from her grasp.</p>

<p>Another instant, and stooping suddenly,
he caught her form in his arms,
and raised her struggling from her
very feet.</p>

<p>"Mary&mdash;you&mdash;are&mdash;mine!" he
hissed the whisper in her ear, and gathered

<!-- page 115 col 2 -->

her quivering form more closely
to his heart.</p>

<p>There was a low-toned and hideous
laugh, muttering or growling through
the air as he spoke, and the form of
Devil-Bug, stole with a hushed footstep
from the entrance of the Walnut
Chamber, and seizing the light in his
talon-fingers, glided from the room,
with the same hyena laugh which had
announced his appearance.</p>

<p>"The trap&mdash;the bottle&mdash;the fire,
for the <i>brother</i>&mdash;" he muttered as
his solitary eye, glanced upon the Libertine
and his struggling victim,
neither of whom had marked his
entrance&mdash;"For the <i>Sister</i>&mdash;ha!
ha! ha! The '<i>handsome</i>' Devil-Bug&mdash;Monk
Gusty&mdash;'tends to her!
'Bijah didn't listen for nothin'&mdash;ha,
ha! this beats the <i>charcoal</i>, quite hollow!"</p>

<p>He disappeared, and the Rose Chamber
was wrapt in midnight darkness.</p>

<p>Darkness! There was a struggle,
and a shriek and a prayer. Darkness!
There was an oath and a groan,
mingling in chorus. Darkness! A
wild cry for mercy, a name madly
shrieked, and a fierce execration.
Darkness! Another struggle, a low
moaning sound, and a stillness like
that of the grave. Now darkness and
silence mingle together and all is still.</p>

<p>In some old book of mysticism and
superstition, I have read this wild
legend, which mingling as it does the
terrible with the grotesque, has still its
meaning and its moral.</p>

<p>In the sky, far, far above the earth&mdash;so
the legend runs&mdash;there hangs
an Awful Bell, invisible to mortal eye,

<!-- page 116 col 1 -->

which angel hands alone may toll,
which is never tolled save when the
Unpardonable Sin is committed on
earth, and then its judgment peal rings
out like the blast of the archangel's
trumpet, breaking on the ear of the
Criminal, and on his ear alone, with
a sound that freezes his blood with horror.
The peal of the Bell, hung in
the azure depths of space, announces
to the Guilty one, that he is an outcast
from God's mercy forever, that his
Crime can never be pardoned, while
the throne of the Eternal endures;
that in the hour of Death, his soul will
be darkened by the hopeless prospect
of an eternity of wo; wo, without limit,
despair without hope; the torture
of the never-dying worm, and the unquenchable
flame, forever and forever.</p>

<p>Reader! Did the sound of the
Judgment Bell, pealing with one awful
toll, from the invisible air, break
over the soul of the Libertine, as in
darkness and in silence, he stood shuddering
over the victim of his Crime?</p>

<p>If in the books of the Last Day,
there shall be found written down, but
<i>One unpardonable</i> crime, that crime
will be known as the foul wrong, accomplished
in the gaudy Rose Chamber
of Monk-Hall, by the wretch, who
now stood trembling in the darkness
of the place, while his victim lay
senseless at his feet.</p>

<p>There was darkness and silence for
a few brief moments, and then a
stream of light flashed around the
Rose Chamber.</p>

<p>Like a fiend, returned to witness
some appalling scene of guilt, which he
had but a moment left, Devil-Bug stood

<!-- page 116 col 2 -->

in the doorway of the Walnut Chamber.
He grimly smiled, as he surveyed
the scene.</p>

<p>And then with a hurried gesture, a
pallid face and blood-shot eyes, as
though some Phantom tracked his
footsteps, Lorrimer rushed madly by
him, and disappeared into the Painted
Chamber. At the very moment of his
disappearance, Devil-Bug raised the
light on high, and started backward
with a sudden impulse of surprise.</p>

<p>"<i>Dead&mdash;Dead</i> and come to life!"
he shrieked, and then the gaze of his
solitary eye was fixed upon the entrance
to the Walnut Room. With a
mechanical gesture, he placed the light
upon the table and fled madly from the
chamber, while the curtains opening
into the Walnut Room rustled to and
fro, for a single instant, and then a
ghastly face, with livid cheeks and burning
eyes, appeared between the crimson
folds, gazing silently around the place,
with a glance, that no living man
would choose to encounter, for his
weight in gold&mdash;it was so like the
look of one arisen from the dead.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br/>

<p>CHAPTER FOURTEENTH.</p>

<p class="small">THE GUILTY WIFE.</p>

</div>

<p>THE light of the dark-lanthern
streamed around the spot, where the
Merchant stood.</p>

<p>Behind him, all was darkness, while
the lanthern, held extended in his left
hand, flung a ruddy blaze of light, over
the outlines of the massive bed. Long

<!-- page 117 col 1 -->

silk curtains, of rich azure, fell drooping
in voluminous folds, to the very
floor, concealing the bed from view,
while from within the gorgeous curtaining,
that low softened sound, like a woman
breathing in her sleep, came faintly
to the Merchant's ear.</p>

<p>Livingstone advanced. The manner
in which he held the lanthern flung
his face in shadow, but you could see
that his form quivered with a tremulous
motion, and in the attempt to
smother a groan which arose to his
lips, a thick gurgling sound like the
death-rattle, was heard in his throat.</p>

<p>Gazing from the shadow that enveloped
his face, Livingstone, with an involuntary
glance took in the details of
the gorgeous couch&mdash;the rich curtaining
of light azure satin, closely drawn
around the bed; the canopy overhead
surmounted by a circle of glittering
stars, arranged like a coronet; and
the voluptuous shapes, assumed by the
folds, as they fell drooping to the floor,
all burst like a picture on his eye.</p>

<p>Beside the bed stood a small table&mdash;resembling
a lady's work stand&mdash;covered
with a plain white cloth. The
silver sheath of a large Bowie knife,
resting on the white cloth, shone glittering
in the light, and attracted the
Merchant's attention.</p>

<p>He laid the pistol which he held at
his right side, upon the table and raised
the Bowie knife to the light. The
sheath was of massive silver, and the
blade of the keenest steel. The handle
fashioned like the sheath, of massive
silver, bore a single name, engraved
in large letters near the hilt, <i>Algernon
Fitz-Cowles</i>, and on the blade
of polished steel, amid a wreath of
flowers glittered the motto in the expressive

<!-- page 117 col 2 -->

slang of southern braggarts&mdash;'Stranger
avoid a snag.'</p>

<p>Silently Livingstone examined the
blade of the murderous weapon. It
was sharp as a razor, with the glittering
point inclining from the edge,
like a Turkish dagger. The merchant
grasped the handle of this knife in his
right hand, and holding the lanthern
on high, advanced to the bedside.</p>

<p>"His own knife&mdash;" muttered Livingstone&mdash;"shall
find its way to his
cankered heart&mdash;"</p>

<p>With the point of the knife, he silently
parted the hangings of the bed, and
the red glare of the lanthern flashed
within the azure folds, revealing a
small portion of the sleeping couch.</p>

<p>A moment passed, and Livingstone
seemed afraid to gaze within the hangings,
for he turned his head aside,
more than once, and the thick gurgling
noise again was heard in his
throat. At last, raising the lanthern
gently overhead, so that its beams
would fall along a small space of the
couch, while the rest was left in darkness,
and grasping the knife with a
firmer hold he gazed upon the spectacle
disclosed to his view.</p>

<p>Her head deep sunken in a downy
pillow, a beautiful woman, lay wrapt
in slumber. By the manner in which
the silken folds of the coverlid were
disposed, you might see that her form
was full, large and voluptuous. Thick
masses of jet-black hair fell, glossy
and luxuriant, over her round neck
and along her uncovered bosom, which
swelling with the full ripeness of
womanhood, rose gently in the light.
She lay on her side, with her head
resting easily on one large, round arm,

<!-- page 118 col 1 -->

half hidden by the masses of black
hair, streaming over the snow white
pillow, while the other arm was flung
carelessly along her form, the light
falling softly over the clear transparent
skin, the full roundness of its
shape, and the small and delicate hand,
resting gently on the coverlid.</p>

<p>Her face, appearing amid the tresses
of her jet-black hair, like a fair picture
half-hidden in sable drapery, was
marked by a perfect regularity of feature,
a high forehead, arching eyebrows
and long dark lashes, resting
on the velvet skin of each glowing
cheek. Her mouth was opened slightly
as she slept, the ivory whiteness of
her teeth, gleaming through the rich
vermilion of her parted lips.</p>

<p>She lay on that gorgeous couch, in
an attitude of voluptuous ease; a perfect
incarnation of the Sensual Woman,
who combines the beauty of a mere
animal, with an intellect strong and
resolute in its every purpose.</p>

<p>And over that full bosom, which
rose and fell with the gentle impulse
of slumber, over that womanly bosom,
which should have been the home of
pure thoughts and wifely affections,
was laid a small and swarthy hand,
whose fingers, heavy with rings, pressed
against the ivory skin, all streaked
with veins of delicate azure, and clung
twiningly among the dark tresses
that hung drooping over the breast,
as its globes rose heaving into view,
like worlds of purity and womanhood.</p>

<p>It was a strange sight for a man to
see, whose only joy, in earth or
heaven, was locked within that snowy
bosom, and yet Livingstone, the husband,
stood firm and silent, as he

<!-- page 118 col 2 -->

gazed upon that strange hand, half-hidden
by the drooping curls.</p>

<p>It required but a slight motion of his
hand, and the glare of the light flashed
over the other side of the couch. The
flash of the lanthern, among the
shadows of the bed, was but for a moment,
and yet Livingstone beheld the
face of a dark-hued man, whose long
dark hair mingled its heavy curls with
the glossy tresses of his wife, while
his hand reaching over her shoulder,
rested, like a thing of foul pollution
upon her bosom.</p>

<p>They slumbered together, slumbered
in their guilt, and the Avenger
stood gazing upon their faces while
their hearts were as unconscious of his
glance, as they were of the death which
glittered over them in the upraised
knife.</p>

<p>"Wife of mine&mdash;your slumber
shall be deep and long&mdash;"</p>

<p>And as the whisper hissed from between
the clenched teeth of the husband,
he raised the dagger suddenly
aloft, and then brought it slowly down
until its point quivered within a finger's
width of the heaving bosom,
while the light of the lanthern held
above his head, streamed over his livid
face, and over the blooming countenance
of his fair young wife.</p>

<p>The dagger glittered over her
bosom; lower and lower it sank until
a deeper respiration, a single heart-drawn
sigh, might have forced the
silken skin upon the glittering point,
when the guilty woman murmured in
her sleep.</p>

<p>"Algernon&mdash;a coronet&mdash;wealth
and power&mdash;" were the broken words
that escaped from her lips.</p>

<p>Again the husband raised the knife,

<!-- page 119 col 1 -->

but it was with the hand clenched, and
the sinews stiffened for the work of
death.</p>

<p>"Seek your Algernon in the grave&mdash;"
he whispered, with a convulsive
smile, as his blue eyes, all alive with
a glance, like a madman's gaze, surveyed
the guilty wife&mdash;"Let the coronet
be hung around your fleshless
skull&mdash;let your wealth be a coffin,
and&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;your power&mdash;corruption
and decay&mdash;"</p>

<p>It may have been that some feeling
of the olden-time, when the image of
that fair young wife dwelt in the
holiest temple of his heart, came suddenly
to the mind of the avenger, in
that moment of fearful suspense, for
his hand trembled for an instant and
he turned his gaze aside, while a single
scalding tear rolled down his livid
cheek.</p>

<p>"Algernon&mdash;" murmured the wife&mdash;"We
will seek a home&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In the grave!"</p>

<p>And the dagger rose, and gleamed
like a stream of flame overhead, and
then sank down with a whirring sound.</p>

<p>Is the bosom red with the stain of
blood?</p>

<p>Has the keen knife severed the
veins and pierced the heart?</p>

<p>The blow of a strong arm, stricken
over Livingstone's shoulder, dashed
his hand suddenly aside, and the knife
sank to the very hilt in the pillow,
within a hair's breadth of Dora's face.
The knife touched the side of her
cheek, and a long and glossy curl,
severed from her head by the blow,
lay resting on the pillow.</p>

<p>Livingstone turned suddenly round,
with a deep muttered oath, while his
massive form rose towering to its full

<!-- page 119 col 2 -->

height. Luke Harvey stood before
him, his cold and glittering eye, fixed
upon his face, with an expression of
the deepest agitation.</p>

<p>"Stand back Sir&mdash;" muttered Livingstone
with a quivering lip&mdash;"This
spot is sacred to me! I want
no witness to my wrong&mdash;nor to my
vengeance!"</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;ha!" sneered Luke bending
forward until his eyes glared fixedly
in the face of the Husband&mdash;"Is this
a vengeance for a man like you?"</p>

<p>"Luke&mdash;again I warn you&mdash;leave
me to my shame, and its punishment&mdash;"</p>

<p>" 'Shame' 'Punishment!' Ha&mdash;ha! You
have been wronged in secret,
slowly and quietly wronged, and yet
would punish that wrong, by blow
that brings but a single pang!"</p>

<p>"Luke&mdash;you are right&mdash;" whispered
Livingstone, his agitated manner
subsiding into a look of calm and fearful
determination&mdash;"The wrong has
been secret, long in progress, horrible
in result. So let the punishment be.
She shall see <i>the</i> Death&mdash;" and his
eye flashed with a maniac wildness&mdash;"She
shall see the Death as it slowly
approaches, she shall feel it as it
winds its very fangs into her very
heart, she shall know that all hope is
in vain, while my voice will whisper
in her freezing ear&mdash;'Dora, it is by
my will that you die! Shriek&mdash;Dora&mdash;shriek
for aid! Death is cold and
icy&mdash;I can save you! I your&mdash;husband!
I can save you, but will
not! Die&mdash;Adultress&mdash;die&mdash;' "</p>

<p>"Algernon&mdash;" murmured Dora
half-awakened from her sleep&mdash;"There
is a cold hand laid against my
cheek&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 120 col 1 -->

<p>"She wakes!" whispered Luke&mdash;"The
dagger&mdash;the lanthern&mdash;"</p>

<p>It required but a single moment for
Livingstone to draw the knife, from the
pillow, where it rested against the
blooming cheek of the wife, while
Luke, with a sudden moment grasped
the lanthern, and closed its door, leaving
the Chamber wrapt in midnight
darkness.</p>

<p>The husband stood motionless as a
stone, and Luke held his very breath
as the voice of Dora broke on their
ears, in tones of alarm and terror.</p>

<p>"Algernon&mdash;" she whispered, as
she started from her slumber&mdash;"Awake&mdash;Do
you not hear the sound of voices,
by the bedside? Hist! Could it
have been <i>the</i> dream? Algernon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Deuced uncomfortable to be waked-up
this way&mdash;" murmured a sleepy
voice&mdash;"What's the matter Dora?
What about a dream?"</p>

<p>"I was awakened just now from my
sleep by the sound of voices.&mdash;I
thought a blaze of light flashed round
the room, while my hus&mdash;that is, Livingstone
stood at the bedstead. And
then I felt a cold hand laid against my
cheek&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;ha! Rather good, <i>that!</i>
D'ye know Dora that I had a dream
too? I dreamt that I was in the
front parlor, second story you know,
in your house on Fourth Street, when
the old fellow came in, and read your
note on the table. Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;and then&mdash;are
you listening?&mdash;I thought that
the old gentleman while he was reading,
turned to a bright pea-green in the
face, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hist! Do you not hear some one
breathing in the room?"</p>

<p>"Pshaw Dora, you're nervous! Go

<!-- page 120 col 2 -->

to sleep my love. Don't lose your
rest for all the dreams in the world.
Good night, Dora!"</p>

<p>"A little touch of farce with our
tragedy&mdash;" half-muttered Luke, as a
quiet chuckle shook his frame&mdash;"Egad!
If they talk in this strain
much longer, I'll have to guffaw! It's
rather too much for my risibles; this
is! A husband standing in the dark
by the bedside, while his wife and her
paramour are telling their pleasant
dreams, in which he figures as the
hero&mdash;"</p>

<p>Whether a smile passed over Livingstone's
face, or a frown, Luke
could not tell, for the room was dark
as a starlit night, yet the quick gasping
sound of a man struggling for
breath, heard through the darkness,
seem to indicate anything but the pleasant
laugh or the jovial chuckle.</p>

<p>"They sleep again!" muttered Luke&mdash;"She
has sunken into slumber
while Death watches at the bedside.
Curse it&mdash;how that fellow snores!"</p>

<p>There was a long pause of darkness
and silence. No word escaped
the Husband's lips, no groan convulsed
his chest, no half-muttered cry of
agony, indicated the struggle which
was silently rending his soul, as with
a viper's fangs.</p>

<p>"Livingstone&mdash;" whispered Luke
after a long pause&mdash;"Where are you?
Confound it man, I can't hear you
breathe. I'm afraid to uncover the
light&mdash;it may awaken them again.
I say Livingstone&mdash;hadn't we better
leave these quarters&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I could have borne expressions of
remorse from her lips&mdash;I could have
listened to sudden outpourings of horror
wrung from her soul by the very

<!-- page 121 col 1 -->

blackness of her guilt, but this grovelling
familiarity with vice!"</p>

<p>"Matter-of-fact pollution, as you
might observe&mdash;" whispered Luke.</p>

<p>"Luke, I tell you, the cup is full to
overflowing&mdash;but I will drain it to the
dregs!"</p>

<p>"Now's your time&mdash;" whispered
Luke, as, swinging the curtain aside,
he suffered the light of the lanthern to
fall over the bed&mdash;"Dora looks quite
pretty. Fitz-Cowles decidedly interesting&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And on that bosom have I slept!"
exclaimed Livingstone, in a voice of
agony, as he gazed upon his slumbering
wife&mdash;"Those arms have clung
round my neck&mdash;and <i>now!</i> Ha!
Luke you may think me mad, but I
tell ye man, that there is the spirit of
a slow and silent revenge creeping
through my veins. <i>She</i> has <i>dishonored</i>
me! Do you read anything like
<i>forgiveness</i> in my face?"</p>

<p>"Not much o' it I assure you. But
come, Livingstone let's be going.
This is not the time nor place for
your revenge. Let's travel."</p>

<p>Livingstone laid down the bowie
knife, and with a smile of bitter
mockery, seized a small pair of scissors
from the work-basket which stood on
the table.</p>

<p>"You smile, Luke?" he whispered,
as, leaning over the bedside, he laid
his hand upon the jet-black hair of the
slumbering Fitz-Cowles;&mdash;"Ha-ha!
I will leave the place, but d'ye see,
Luke, I must take some slight keepsake,
to remind me of the gallant
Colonel. A lock of his hair, you
know, Luke?"</p>

<p>"Egad! Livingstone, I believe
you're going mad! A lock of his

<!-- page 121 col 2 -->

hair? Pshaw! You'll want a straight-jacket
soon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And a lock of my Dora's hair&mdash;"
whispered Livingstone, as his blue
eyes flashed from beneath his dark
eyebrows, while his lips wore that
same mocking smile&mdash;"But you see
the knife saved me all trouble. Here
is a glossy tress severed by the Colonel's
dagger. Now let me wind them
together, Luke, let me lay them next
to my heart, Luke&mdash;yes, smile my
fellow&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"Hist! Your wife stirs in her
sleep&mdash;you will awaken them again."</p>

<p>"D'ye know, Luke," cried Livingstone,
drawing his partner close to
his side, and looking in his face, with
a vacant glance, that indicated a temporary
derangement of intellect&mdash;"D'ye
know, Luke, that I didn't do
that, o' my own will? Hist! Luke&mdash;closer&mdash;closer&mdash;I'll
tell you. The
Devil was at the bedside, Luke; he
whispered it in my ear, he bade me
take these keepsakes&mdash;ha, ha, ha&mdash;what
a jolly set of fellows we are!
And then, Luke&mdash;" his voice sank to
a thrilling whisper&mdash;"He pointed
with his iron hand to <i>the last scene</i>,
in which my vengeance shall be
complete. She shall beg for mercy,
Luke; aye, on her knees, but&mdash;ha,
ha, ha&mdash;<i>kill&mdash;kill&mdash;kill!</i> is written
in letters of blood before my eyes,
everywhere, Luke, everywhere.
Don't you see it?"</p>

<p>He pointed vacantly at the air as he
spoke, and seized Luke by the shoulder,
as though he would command his
attention to the blood-red letters.</p>

<p>Luke was conscious that he stood
in the presence of a madman.</p>

<p>Inflexible as he was in his own secret

<!-- page 122 col 1 -->

purpose of revenge, upon the woman
who had trampled on his very
heart, Luke still regarded the Merchant
with a feeling akin to brotherhood.
As the fearful fact impressed
itself on his soul, that Livingstone
stood before him, deprived of reason,
an expression of the deepest feeling
shadowed the countenance of Luke,
and his voice was broken in its tones
as he endeavored to persuade the
madman, to leave the scene of his dishonor
and shame.</p>

<p>"Come! Livingstone! let us go&mdash;"
said Luke, taking his partner by
the arm, and leading him gently toward
the closet.</p>

<p>"But I've got the keepsakes safe,
Luke&mdash;" whispered Livingstone, as
that wild light flashed from his large
blue eyes&mdash;"D'ye see the words in
the air, Luke? Now they change to
her name&mdash;Dora, Dora, Dora! All
in blood-red letters. I say Luke, let's
have a quiet whist party&mdash;there's
four of us&mdash;Dora and I; you and
Fitz-Cowles&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm willing&mdash;" exclaimed Luke,
as with a quick movement he seized
the pistol&mdash;left by Livingstone on the
table, and concealed it within the
breast of his greatcoat&mdash;"Suppose we
step into the next room, and get everything
ready for the party&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're keen, Luke, keen, but I'm
even with you&mdash;" whispered Livingstone
as his livid face lighted up with
a sudden gleam of intelligence&mdash;"Here
we stand on the threshold of
this closet&mdash;we are about to leave my
wife's bed-room. You think I'm mad.
Do I look like a madman? I know
there is no whist-party to be held this

<!-- page 122 col 2 -->

night, I know that&mdash;Hist. Luke?
Don't you see it, all pictured forth in
the air? The scene of my vengeance?
In colors of blood, painted by the
Devil's hand? Yonder Luke&mdash;yonder!
How red it grows&mdash;and then
in letters of fire, everywhere, everywhere,
is written&mdash;Dora&mdash;Dora&mdash;Dora&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was a fearful spectacle to see
that strong man, with his imposing figure,
raised to its full stature and his
thoughtful brow, lit up with an expression
of idiotic wonder, as standing
on the verge of the secret door, he
pointed wildly at the blood-red picture
which his fancy had drawn in the vacant
air while his blue eyes dilated
with a maniac glance, and his face
grew yet more livid and ghastly.</p>

<p>"Come, Livingstone&mdash;" cried Luke
gently leading him through the closet&mdash;"You
had better leave this place&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And yet Dora, is sleeping here?
My young wife? The mother of my
children? Do ye think Luke, that
I'd have believed you last Thursday
morning, if you had then told me
this? 'Livingstone, this day-week,
you will leave a chamber in a brothel,
and leave your young wife, sleeping
in another man's arms.' But never
mind Luke&mdash;it will all be right.
For I tell ye, it is there, there before
me in colors of blood! That last
scene of my vengeance! And there&mdash;there&mdash;in
letters of flame&mdash;Dora!
Dora! Dora!"</p>

<p>And while the fair young wife slept
quietly in the bed of guilt and shame,
Luke led the Merchant from the room
and from the house.</p>

<p>CHAPTER FIFTEENTH.</p>

<p class="small">THE DISHONOR.</p>

</div>

<p>ALL was silent within the Rose
Chamber. For a single moment that
pale visage glared from the crimson
hangings, concealing the entrance to
the Walnut Room, and then with a
measured footstep, Byrnewood Arlington
advanced along the floor, his
countenance ghastly as the face of
Lazarus, at the very instant, when in
obedience to the words of the Incarnate,
life struggled with corruption and
death, over his cheek and brow.</p>

<p>Bring home to your mind the scene,
when Lazarus lay prostrate in the
grave, a stiffened corse, his face all
clammy with corruption, the closed
eyes surrounded by loathsome circles
of decay, the cheeks sunken, and the
lips fallen in: let the words of Jesus
ring in your ears, "Lazarus, come
forth!" And then as the blue eyelids
slowly unclose, as the gleam of life
shoots forth from the glassy eye, as
the flush of health struggles with the
yellowish hue of decay along each
cheek, as life and death mingling in that
face for a single moment, maintain a
fearful combat for the mastery; then I
pray you, gaze upon the visage of
Byrnewood Arlington, and mark how
like it is to the face of one arisen from
the dead; a ghastly face, on whose
fixed outline the finger-traces of corruption
are yet visible, from whose
eyes the film of the grave is not yet
passed away.</p>

<p>The gaze of Byrnewood, as he
strode from the entrance of the Walnut
Chamber, was rivetted to the floor.
Had the eyes of the rattlesnake gleamed
from the carpet, slowly drawing its

<!-- page 123 col 2 -->

victim to his ruin, Byrnewood could
not have fixed his gaze upon the object
in the centre of the floor, with a
more fearful and absorbing intensity.</p>

<p>There, thrown prostrate on the
gaudy carpet, insensible and motionless,
the form of Mary Arlington lay
at the brother's feet.</p>

<p>He sank silently on his knees.</p>

<p>He took her small white hand&mdash;now
cold as marble&mdash;within his own,
he swept the unbound tresses back
from her pallid brow. Her eyes were
closed as in death, her lips hung apart,
the lower one trembling with a scarcely
perceptible movement, her cheek
was pale as ashes, with a deep red tint
in the centre.</p>

<p>Byrnewood uttered no sound, nor
shrieked forth any wild exclamation
of revenge, or wo, or despair. He
silently drew the folds of the night-robe
round her form, and veiled her
bosom&mdash;but a moment agone warmed
into a glow by the heart's fires, now
paled by the fingers of the ravisher&mdash;he
veiled her fair young bosom from
the light.</p>

<p>It was a sad sight to look upon.
That face, so fair and blooming, but a
moment past, now pale as death, with
spot of burning red on the centre of
each cheek: that bosom, a moment
since, heaving with passion, now still
and motionless; those delicate hands
with tiny fingers, which had bravely
fought for honor, for virtue, for purity,
an instant ago, now resting cold and
stiffened by her side.</p>

<p>Thick tresses of dark brown hair,
hung round her neck. With that
same careful movement of his hand,
Byrnewood swept them aside. Along
the smooth surface of that fair neck,

<!-- page 124 col 1 -->

like some noisome reptile, trailing
over a lovely flower, a large vein,
black and distorted, shot upward,
darkening the glossy skin, while it
told the story of the maiden's dishonor
and shame.</p>

<p>"My sister!" was the solitary exclamation
that broke from Byrnewood's
lips as he gazed upon the form
of the unconscious girl, and his large
dark eye, dilating as he spoke, glanced
around with an expression of strange
meaning.</p>

<p>He raised her form in his arms, and
kissed her cold lips again and again.
No tear trickled from his eyelids; no
sigh heaved his bosom; no deep muttered
execration manifested the agitation
of his soul.</p>

<p>"My sister!" he again whispered, and
gathered her more close to his heart.</p>

<p>A slight flush deepening over her
cheek, even while he spoke, gave
signs of returning consciousness.</p>

<p>Mary slowly unclosed her eyes, and
gazed with a wandering glance around
the room. An instant passed ere she
discovered that she lay in Byrnewood's
arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, brother&mdash;" she exclaimed,
not with a wild shriek, but in a low-toned
voice, whose slightest accent
quivered with an emphasis of despair&mdash;"Oh,
brother! Leave me&mdash;leave
me. I am not worthy of your touch.
I am vile, brother, oh, most vile!
Leave me&mdash;leave me, for I am lost!"</p>

<p>"Mary!" whispered Byrnewood,
resisting her attempt to unwind his
arms from her form, while the blood,
filling the veins of his throat, produced
an effect like strangulation&mdash;"Mary!
Do not&mdash;do not speak thus&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 124 col 2 -->

<p>He could say no more, but his face
dropped on her cold bosom, and the
tears, which he had silently prayed for,
came at last.</p>

<p>He wept, while that low choking
noise, sounding in his throat, that involuntary
heaving of the chest, that
nervous quivering of the lip, all betokened
the strong man wrestling with
his agony.</p>

<p>"Do not weep for me, brother&mdash;"
she said, in the same low-toned voice&mdash;"I
am polluted, brother, and am
not worthy of the slightest tear you
shed for me. Unwind your arms&mdash;brother,
do not resist me&mdash;for the
strength of despair is in these hands&mdash;unwind
your arms, and let me no
longer pollute you by my touch&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was something fearful in the
expression of her face as she spoke.
She was no longer the trembling child
whose young face, marked the inexperience
of her stainless heart. A new
world had broken upon her soul, not a
world of green trees, silver streams
and pleasant flowers, but a chaos of
ashes, and mouldering flame; a lurid
sky above, a blasted soil below, and
one immense horizon of leaden clouds,
hemming in the universe of desolation.</p>

<p>She had sprung from the maiden
into the woman, but a blight was on
her soul forever. The crime had not
only stained her person with dishonor,
but, like the sickening warmth of the
hot-house, it had forced the flower of
her soul, into sudden and unnatural
maturity. It was the maturity of precocious
experience. In her inmost
soul, she felt that she was a dishonored
thing, whose very touch was pollution,
whose presence, among the pure and
stainless, would be a bitter mockery

<!-- page 125 col 1 -->

and foul reproach. The guilt was not
hers, but the Ruin blasted her purity
forever.</p>

<p>"Unwind your arms, my brother&mdash;"
she exclaimed, tearing herself from his
embrace, with all a maniac's strength&mdash;"I
am polluted. You are pure.
Oh do not touch me&mdash;do not touch
me. Leave me to my shame&mdash;oh,
leave me&mdash;"</p>

<p>She unwound her form from his
embrace, and sank crouching into a
corner of the Rose Chamber, extending
her hands with a frightened gesture,
as though she feared his slightest
touch.</p>

<p>"Mary" shrieked Byrnewood, flinging
his arms on high, with a movement
of sudden agitation&mdash;"Oh, do
not look upon me thus! Come to me&mdash;oh,
Mary&mdash;come to me, for I am
your brother."</p>

<p>The words, the look and the trembling
movement of his outspread arms,
all combined, acted like a spell upon
the intellect of the ruined girl. She
rose wildly to her feet, as though impelled
by some invisible influence, and
fell tremblingly into her brother's arms.</p>

<p>While one dark and horrible thought,
was working its way through the avenues
of his soul, he gathered her to
his breast again and again.</p>

<p>And in that moment of silence and
unutterable thought, the curtains leading
into the Painted Chamber were
slowly thrust aside, and Lorrimer
again appeared upon the scene. Stricken
with remorse, he had fled with
a madman's haste from the scene
of his crime, and while his bosom was
torn by a thousand opposing thoughts,
he had endeavored to drown the voice
within him, and crush the memory of

<!-- page 125 col 2 -->

the nameless wrong. It was all in
vain. Impelled by an irresistible desire,
to look again upon the victim of
his crime, he re-entered the Rose Chamber.
It was a strange sight, to see
the Brother kneeling on the floor, as
he gathered his sister's form in his
arms, and yet the Seducer, gave
no sign nor indication of surprise.</p>

<p>A fearful agitation was passing over
the Libertine's soul, as unobserved by
the brother or sister, he stood gazing
upon them with a wandering glance.
His face, so lately flushed with passion,
in its vilest hues, was now palest
and livid. His white lips, trembled
with a nervous moment, and his hands,
extended on either side, clutched vacantly
at the air, as though he wrestled
with an unseen foe.</p>

<p>While the thought of horror, was
slowly darkening over Byrnewood's
soul, a thought as dark and horrible
gathered like a Phantom over the mind
of Lorrimer.</p>

<p>A single word of explanation, will
make the subsequent scene, clear and
intelligible to the reader.</p>

<p>From generation to generation, the
family of the Lorrimers, had been
subject to an aberration of intellect, as
sudden as it was terrible; always resulting
from any peculiar agitation of
mind, which might convulse the soul,
with an emotion remarkable for its
power or energy. It was a hallucination,
a temporary madness, a sudden
derangement of intellect. It always
succeeded an uncontrollable outburst
of anger, or grief, or joy. From father
to son, since the family had first
come over to Pennsylvania, with the
Proprietor and Peace-Maker William
Penn, this temporary derangement of

<!-- page 126 col 1 -->

intellect, had descended as a fearful
heritage.</p>

<p>Lorrimer had been subject to this
madness, but once in his life, when
his father's corse lay stiffened before
his eyes. And now, as he stood gazing
upon the form of the brother and
sister, Lorrimer, felt this temporary
madness stealing over his soul, in the
form of a strange hallucination, while
he became conscious, that in a single
moment, the horror which shook his
frame, would rise to his lips in words
of agony and fear.</p>

<p>"Raise your hands with mine, to
Heaven, Mary&mdash;" exclaimed Byrnewood
as the Thought which had been
working over his soul, manifested its
intensity in words&mdash;"Raise your
hands with mine, and curse the author
of your ruin! Lift your voice with
mine, up to the God, who beheld the
wrong&mdash;who will visit the wronger
with a doom meet, for his crime&mdash;lift
your voice with mine, and curse
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh Byrnewood, do not, do not
curse <i>him</i>. The wrong has been done
but do not, I beseech you, visit his head
with a curse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hear me, oh God, before whom,
I now raise my hands, in the vow of
justice! In life I will be to this wretch,
as a Fate, a Doom, a Curse!</p>

<p>"I am vile&mdash;oh God&mdash;steeped in
the same vices, which blacken the
heart of this man, cankered by the
same corruption. But the office, which
I now take on myself, raising this
right hand to thee, in witness of my
fixed purpose, would sanctify the darkest
fiend in hell! I am the avenger
of my sister's wrong! She was innocent,
she was pure, she trusted and

<!-- page 126 col 2 -->

was betrayed! I will avenge her!
Before thee, I swear to visit her wrong,
upon the head of her betrayer, with a
doom never to be forgotten in the memory
of man. This right hand I dedicate
to this solemn purpose&mdash;come
what will, come what may, let danger
threaten or death stand in my path,
through sickness and health, through
riches or poverty, I now swear, to hold
my steady pathway onward, my only
object in life the avengement of my
sister's wrong! <i>He</i> shall die by this
hand&mdash;oh God&mdash;I swear it by thy
name&mdash;I swear it by my soul&mdash;I
swear it by the Fiend who impelled
the villain to this deed of crime&mdash;"</p>

<p>As he whispered forth this oath, in
a voice which speaking from the depths
of his chest, had a hollow and sepulchral
sound, the fair girl flung herself
on his breast, and with a wild shriek
essayed to delay the utterance of the
curse, by gathering his face, to her
bosom.</p>

<p>For a moment her efforts were successful.
Lorrimer had stood silent
and pale, while the deep-toned
voice of Byrnewood Arlington, breaking
in accents of doom upon his ear,
had aided and strengthened the strange
hallucination which was slowly gathering
over his brain like a mighty spell.</p>

<p>"There is a wide river before me,
its broad waves tinged with the last
red rays of a winter sunset&mdash;" such
were the words he murmured, extending
his hand, as though pointing to the
scene, which dawned upon his soul&mdash;"A
wide river with its waves surging
against the wharves of a mighty city.
Afar I behold steeples and roofs and
towers, all glowing in the beams of the
setting sun. And as I gaze, the waves

<!-- page 127 col 1 -->

turn to blood, red and ghastly blood&mdash;and
now the sky is a-flame, and the
clouds sweep slowly past, bathed in the
same crimson hue. All is blood&mdash;the
river rushes before me, and the sky
and the city&mdash;all pictured in colors
of blood.</p>

<p>"An invisible hand is leading me to
my doom. There is Death for me,
in yonder river, and I know it, yet
down, down to the rivers banks, down,
down into the red waters, I must go.
Ha! ha! 'Tis a merry death! The
blood-red waves rise above me&mdash;higher,
higher, higher! Yonder is the city,
yonder the last rays of the setting sun,
glitter on the roof and steeple, yonder
is the blood-red sky&mdash;and ah! I tell
ye I will not die&mdash;you shall not sink
me beneath these gory waves! Devil!
Is not your vengeance satisfied&mdash;must
you feast your eyes with the sight of
my closing agonies&mdash;must your hand
grasp me by the throat, and your foot
trample me beneath the waves? I tell
you I will not, will not die&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha! Here's purty
going's on&mdash;" laughed the hoarse voice
of Devil-Bug, as his hideous form appeared
in the doorway of the Walnut
Chamber, with his attendant negroes
at his back&mdash;"Seems the gal helped
him off. There he sits&mdash;the ornery
feller, with his sister in his arms&mdash;while
Gusty, is a-doin' some ravin's
on his own individooal hook. Come
here Glow-worm&mdash;here Musquito&mdash;come
here my pets, and tend to this
leetle family party&mdash;"</p>

<p>In another instant the Rose Chamber
became the scene of a strange
picture.</p>

<p>Byrnewood had arisen to his feet,
while Lorrimer stood spell-bound by

<!-- page 127 col 2 -->

the hallucination which possessed his
brain. The handsome Libertine stood
in the centre of the room, his form dilating
to its full stature, his face the
hue of ashes, while with his hazel eyes,
glaring on vacancy, he clutched wildly
at the air, starting backward at the
same moment, as though some invisible
hand, was silently impelling him
to the brink of the blood-red river,
which rolled tumultuously at his feet,
which slowly gathered around him,
which began to heave upward to his
very lips.</p>

<p>On one side, in a half-kneeling position,
crouched Mary Arlington, her
large blue eyes, starting from her
pallid face, as with her upraised hands,
crossed over her bosom, she gazed
upon the agitated countenance of the
seducer, with a glance of mingled awe
and wonder; while, on the other side,
stern and erect, Byrnewood, with his
pale visage darkening in a settled
frown, with one foot advanced and his
hand upraised, seemed about to strike
the libertine to the floor.</p>

<p>In the background, rendered yet
more hideous by the dimness of the
scene, Devil-Bug stood grinning in
derisive triumph as he motioned his
attendants, the Herculean negroes, to
advance and secure their prey.</p>

<p>There was silence for a single moment.
Lorrimer still stood clutching
at the vacant air, Mary still gazed
upon his face in awe, Byrnewood yet
paused in his meditated blow, while
Devil-Bug, with Musquito and Glow-worm
at his back, seemed quietly enjoying
the entire scene, as he glanced
from side to side with his solitary eye.</p>

<p>"Unhand me&mdash;I will not die&mdash;"
shrieked Lorrimer, as he fancied that

<!-- page 128 col 1 -->

phantom hand, gathering tightly round
his throat, while the red waters swept
surging to his very lips&mdash;"I will not
die&mdash;I defy&mdash;ah! ah! You strangle
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The hour of your death has come!
You have said it&mdash;and it shall be so!"
whispered Byrnewood, advancing a
single step, as his dark eye was fixed
upon the face of Lorrimer&mdash;"While
your own guilty heart spreads a blood-red
river before your eyes, this hand&mdash;no
phantom hand&mdash;shall work
your death!"</p>

<p>He sprang forward, while a shriek
arose from Mary's lips, he sprang
forward with his eye blazing with excitement,
and his outspread hand
ready for the work of vengeance, but
as he sprang, the laugh of Devil-Bug
echoed at his back, and the sinewy
arms of the negroes gathered suddenly
round his form and flung him as suddenly
to the floor.</p>

<p>"Here's fine goin's on&mdash;" exclaimed
Devil-Bug, as he glanced from
face to face&mdash;"A feller who's been a
leetle too kind to a gal, stands a-makin'
speeches at nothin'. The gal kneels
on the carpet as though she were a

<!-- page 128 col 2 -->

gettin' up a leetle prayer on her own
account; and this 'ere onery feller&mdash;git
a good grip o' him you bull-dogs&mdash;sets
up a small shop o' cussin' and
sells his cusses for nothin'! Here's
a tea party for ye&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What does all this mean, Devil-Bug&mdash;"
exclaimed Lorrimer, in his
usual voice, as the hallucination passed
from him like a dream, leaving him
utterly unconscious of the strange
vision which had a moment since absorbed
his very soul&mdash;"What does
all this mean? Ha! Byrnewood and
Mary&mdash;I remember! <i>You</i> are <i>her</i>
brother&mdash;are you not?"</p>

<p>"I am her avenger&mdash;" said Byrnewood,
with a ghastly smile, as he endeavored
to free himself from the
grasp of the negroes&mdash;"And your
executioner! Within three days you
shall die by this hand!"</p>

<p>"Ha-ha-ha!" laughed Devil-Bug&mdash;"There's
more than one genelman
as has got a say in that leetle matter!
How d'ye feel, young man? Did you
ever take opium afore? You won't
go to sleep nor nothin'? We can't do
what we like with you? Kin we? Ho-ho-ho!
<i>I wonders how that 'ill work!</i>"</p>

<p class="small">FITZ-COWLES AT HOME.</p>

</div>

<p>THE scene changes to a Chamber
in the fourth story of the TON HOTEL,
which arises along Chestnut Street, a
monster-building, with some hundred
windows varying its red-brick face,
in the way of eyes, covered with green-blind
shutters, looking very much like
so many goggles intended to preserve
the sight of the visual organs aforesaid;
while the verandah, on the ground
floor, affording an entrance to the bar-room,
might be likened to the mouth
of the grand-edifice, always wide open
and ready to swallow a customer.</p>

<p>The sunshine of a cold, clear winter
morning was streaming dimly, between
the half-closed inside shutters,
of the small chamber on the fourth
story. The faint light, pouring between
the shutters, of the two windows,
looking to the south, served to
reveal, certain peculiar characteristics
of the place.</p>

<!-- page 129 col 2 -->

<p>There was a dressing bureau, surmounted
by a hanging mirror, standing
between the two windows of the
chamber. Along the marble top of
the bureau, were disposed various bottles
of perfumes, whose strong scent
impregnated the atmosphere with remarkable
reminiscences of musk, and
orange, and lemon, and <i>patchoully;</i>
a pair of well-used kid gloves, which
had been white yesterday; a rumpled
black scarf; a Play bill figured off
with intoxicated letters, displaying the
entertainment at the Walnut Street
Theatre the night before; and a glittering
bowie knife, side by side with
its silver sheath.</p>

<p>All over the carpet, were scattered
Windsor Chairs, either grouped in circles,
as though they were talking about
the various gentry who had reposed on
their well-cushioned seats; or fixed in
strange positions along the walls, like
waiters at a party, overburdened with
coats and vests and stocks, and other
articles of apparel, thrown carelessly

<!-- page 130 col 1 -->

over their rounds; or yet again flung
down on the floor, with their heels in
the air, as though they had taken a
drop too much, and didn't know how
to get up again.</p>

<p>There was a large sofa on one side
of the room, a coal fire blazing in the
grate opposite; while in the dim distance,
you might perceive the outlines
of a bed, and hear the deep bass of a
heavy snore, which held a concert of
its own, within the closely drawn curtains.</p>

<p>Altogether, that entire room, located
in the fourth story of the Ton House,
said as plainly as a room can say,
that somebody had come home very late
last night, or very early this morning,
most probably in liquor; and called
up as witnesses to this interesting assertion,
the chairs thrown disorderly
about the floor, the gloves and Bowie
knife on the dressing bureau, the hat
on the sofa, and the heavy snore within
the bed.</p>

<p>Sitting in the blaze of light streaming
between the aperture of the half-closed
shutters, was a small Creole
boy, whose slight yet perfectly proportioned
form, was perched on the
edge of a Windsor chair, as with his
legs crossed and his hair flung back
from his tawny face, the young gentleman
was briskly engaged in elaborating
a fashionable boot into the requisite
degree of polish.</p>

<p>The Boy was eminently handsome.
His face was a light brown in hue,
yet perfectly regular in every feature;
his complexion clear as a ripe Seckel
pear; his lips red as May cherries;
his eyebrows pencilled and arching,
and his eyes full, large, and black;
brilliant as diamonds, and glittering

<!-- page 130 col 2 -->

as icicles. Long curling hair, marked
by that peculiar jet black, tinged
with a shade of deep blue, which designates
the child of white and African
parents, fell waving around his neck
and face, in stiffened locks, resembling
in their texture, the mane of a
horse. His form, light, springy and
agile, was the Ideal of a Creole Cupid.
Not an outline too large or too small,
not the slightest disproportion visible
in a single limb; with small feet and
delicate hands, a waist as lithe as a
willow, and a hollow in the back like
a bow gently bent, the Creole, was altogether
one of the most beautiful
things, ever fashioned by the hand of
Nature.</p>

<p>He was a pretty child, and yet his
large black eyes had something in
their glance which spoke of a precocious
intimacy with the vices and
intrigues of manhood.</p>

<p>"Massa tole Dim to polish dat boot
until he see his face in de morroccor&mdash;"
muttered the young gentleman,
brushing away at the glittering
leather&mdash;"Dim can see his nose, and
his two eyes in de boot, but the mouth
ain't not perfect. Stop a minnit, I
bring dat feature out&mdash;ha, ha, hah!"</p>

<p>It was a pleasure to hear the little
fellow talk, there was such a delicate
accent lingering on his words; and
his laugh, not at all similar to the
usual African guffaw, was a quiet
chuckle, which rolled lusciously in his
mouth like a delicious morsel, whose
sweetness he wished to enjoy at leisure.</p>

<p>"Tink I shall hab to discharge
Massa. Debbil of a flare-up 'tween
me and him some day when I tells
him; 'I don't want you any more, you
sah! you kin take dem wages and

<!-- page 131 col 1 -->

go! Kep Dim up till broke ob day.
Say dat Morroccor don' shine? Break
de lookin'-glasses heart&mdash;I tells you.
Till broke ob day kep Dim a-waitin',
and den tumbles into bed, widout so
much as giving de chile a qua-taw!
Oh&mdash;de High-Golly!"</p>

<p>This appeal to Master Endymion's
favorite Saint, the High-Golly, supposed
to be some imaginary Deity,
created by the fertile fancy of the
young Creole, was occasioned by a sudden
mishap with the boot, which resenting
a vigorous push of the brush, slipped
out of his hands, and went spinning
across the room.</p>

<p>"Wonder if the debbil ain't in dat
Morroccor? I jis does. Nebber see
sich a boot in all my born days. I
lay a bran new brass dollar, dat if I
was to set dat boot at de head of the
stair, and no watch him, he'd streak
it right off to de bar room, and call
for a mint-julap, an' pull out his quartair
to pay for it! I jis try him some
day&mdash;Ha! Ha! Ha!"</p>

<p>"I say Dim!"</p>

<p>"Yes Massa&mdash;I'se about&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I say, Dim!" continued the voice
which resounded from the interior of
the bed-curtains, in the dark corner of
the room, where the snore had been
heard&mdash;"I say Dim, what kind of a
day is it?"</p>

<p>"Bran new day Massa. Got its
new coat and trowse's on."</p>

<p>"I say Dim, what have we got to
do to-day?"</p>

<p>"Last night de Curnel, gib dis chile
a kick, in order to mem'randum dese
tings on Dim's memory. Dis mornin'
you got to pay all your creditors.
Dey comes in about an hour. High-Golly&mdash;ain't
dere a lot ob 'em? Den

<!-- page 131 col 2 -->

you got to see de Lady, who libs in
Fourth Street. Den you got to go,
down town, to see if ole Devil-Bug,
keeps dat <i>dere feller</i> safe. You
knows who I means? Den you got to
gib Dim, a qua-taw, and not to gib him
no kick, by no means&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dressing-gown Dim!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Massa&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Got any hot water, ready for me,
Dim?"</p>

<p>"Biles like a steam ingine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Light up the room, Dim!"</p>

<p>And in obedience to this request,
Endymion flung back the shutters,
and the full glare of the sunlight poured
into the room. The owner of the
voice and snore heard from within
the curtains, sprung from the bed and
assuming the dressing gown, advanced
toward the windows.</p>

<p>Col. Fitz-Cowles, the handsome colonel
Fitz-Cowles, stood revealed in
the light, his dark-hued face looking
somewhat worn and haggard, around
the eyes, while his slender form, attired
in the rainbow morning-gown
and close-fitting drawers, though well
proportioned, and graceful in its outlines,
by no means displayed that perfection
of symmetry, which distinguished
the person of the millionaire
in broad daylight, along Chestnut
Street. For instance, the Colonel was
thicker around the waist, thinner about
the hips, smaller in the region of the
calves, than was usual with him, when
arrayed in full dress. His face was
very pale and his cheeks lacked that
deep vermilion tint, which gave such
life to his dusky countenance at the
evening party, or the afternoon parade.</p>

<p>"Dim you d&mdash;l&mdash;" exclaimed the
Colonel, bestowing a gentle hint upon

<!-- page 132 col 1 -->

the gentleman of color, with the toe
of his slipper&mdash;"Go down and get
my breakfast. Tell, the cook to butter
my toast, and broil my steak.
Vanish!"</p>

<p>Dim vanished through the door at
the extreme end of the apartment. Arranging
his shaving materials on the
marble top of the dressing bureau,
Fitz-Cowles commenced the solemn
ceremonies of the toilette.</p>

<p>"Good razor that! Keen! Bad
soap this&mdash;must kick the barber who
sold it to me. Just think of my ticklish
position! In debt up to the ears,
forced to leave the United States Hotel
only a day since, in order to avoid my
creditors: perched in the fourth story
of the Ton House; and why? Because
I can't use the solid stuff, locked
up in that old hair trunk. <i>Can't</i> use
it. Somebody might find out something
if I did. Curse the thing but I
think the old trunk's laughing at me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Razor in hand Fitz-Cowles stooped
to the floor, and drew from beneath
the sofa, an old hair trunk, which
looked as if it had been through all
Napoleon's campaigns, and suffered in
the battle of Waterloo; it was so battered,
and scarred and weather-beaten,
with great wounds of uncovered leather
visible among the worn-out hair,
of its exterior.</p>

<p>"An hundred thousand locked up in
that old ruffian of a trunk&mdash;" muttered
Fitz-Cowles, gazing upon the object,
with an angry scowl&mdash;"Half in
sovereigns&mdash;half in notes! The d&mdash;l
throttle the fool, why couldn't he get it
all in American gold?"</p>

<p>"De toast is buttered and de steak
is briled&mdash;" and as he spoke, Endymion
entered the room, carrying the

<!-- page 132 col 2 -->

breakfast of his Master in his hands
"Muss discharge dat cook. She gits
quite sassy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dim&mdash;" cried Fitz-Cowles, making
a hideous face at the glass in the
effort to shave his chin&mdash;"Set my
breakfast down by the fire, and come
here. Now, Dim, answer me, one
question. <i>Who are we?</i>"</p>

<p>"Massa take de chile for a phillysofer?
Dat berry cute question!
Sometime we are a plantaw from the
Souf&mdash;sometime we are a son of Mexican
Prince; oder time we come from
Englan' and our fader is a Lord. De
High-Golly! We are so many tings,
dat de debbil hisself couldn't count
'em&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where were we this time last
month?"</p>

<p>"Charleston, Massa&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The month before?"</p>

<p>"New Orleans Massa&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Month afore, that, eh, Dim?"</p>

<p>"Bos'on Massa&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How long since we first fixed our
quarters in this city?"</p>

<p>"Six month ago, and been a-travellin'
about eber since. Led dis chile
a debbil ob a life&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What were we travelling about
for&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Axe de ole hair trunk. He tell
you plain as pie-crust&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is, Dim&mdash;"
exclaimed Fitz-Cowles laying down
the razor, and turning to the handsome
Creole boy&mdash;"If you ever whisper a
word to anybody, about anything
you may have seen or heard, while
you travelled about with me, these last
six months, I'll just take this knife,
and skin you, you black scoundrel,
skin you&mdash;d'ye hear?"</p>

<!-- page 133 col 1 -->

<p>Dim looked up into the scowling
face of his master, with a glance of
perfect calmness. The brow of Fitz-Cowles
was disfigured by a hideous
frown, and his entire countenance,
wore an expression, characteristic of a
low bully, who has been accustomed
to the vilest haunts, in the most corrupt
cities of the South. Dim was
used to these sudden outbursts of passion,
when his master, dropping his
gentlemanly repose of manner, was
wont to stand before him with his
Bowie knife in hand, while with a
threatening tongue and sullen brow, he
bade him reveal the things he had seen
and the words he had heard; if he dared.</p>

<p>"You black scoundrel, d'ye hear?"</p>

<p>"De High-Golly! Dim ain't black
and Dim ain't no scoundrel. Yes Massa,
I hears&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you ever whisper a word, mind,
a word, I'd just take this bowie knife,
and cut your heart from your body!
I'd do't I tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What make you do dat for? Dim
couldn't draw bref den&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pshaw! You know better than to
whisper a word! Here&mdash;help me to
dress Dim. My corsets, Dim&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here they are Massa&mdash;" cried
Dim, throwing open, one of the drawers
of the dressing bureau&mdash;"New
pair Massa&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lay that Morning gown on the
chair. Now lace me. Tighter I say&mdash;that
'ill do. That's about the
waist we want&mdash;isn't it Dim?"</p>

<p>"Yes Massa. Dat's de wasp <i>com</i>-plete!"</p>

<p>"Hips, Dim&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which hip you want, Massa?
Big hip or little hip?" cried Endymion,

<!-- page 133 col 2 -->

rummaging in the open drawer&mdash;"Dis
pair do?"</p>

<p>"More subdued, Dim, more subdued.
Just large enough to make my
frock coat set out in the skirt. That's
the idea&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a careful movement Endymion
strapped certain detached portions of
padding, around his master's form below
the waist, and in a moment, this
part of the ceremony was finished,
giving quite a voluptuous swell to the
outline of the Colonel's figure.</p>

<p>"Calves, Dim&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which boots Massa wear to-day?
Hab dis big calf or de toder one?"</p>

<p>"We want a good calf to-day, Dim.
A large, fat calf. That pair will do.
Tie it round the leg&mdash;there, there.
Draw the stocking over it&mdash;gently&mdash;gent-ly!
That's about the outline&mdash;eh?</p>

<p>"Dicky or a shirt, to-day, eh,
Dim?"</p>

<p>"Shirt, Massa, as you are goin' to
hold your <i>Lebee!</i>"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! Won't there be a lot o'
'em&mdash;the creditors? Black scarf&mdash;Dim?"</p>

<p>"Dar it is, Massa. Turn de collar
down and tie up de scarf wid dis gole
pin&mdash;dat's de ticket!"</p>

<p>"Now, Dim, my slippers. She
worked them for me, <i>you know</i>, Dim?
How many ladies are engaged to be
married to us, if we will have them?"</p>

<p>"Dare's de soap biler's daughter,
who spends her fader's fortin in perfumery.
Dare's de rich grocery man's
daughter, and de hardware merchant's
daughter, and de wool merchant's only
chile, and dare's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, d&mdash;d them; the <i>set</i> is cursed

<!-- page 134 col 1 -->

low. Black pants, Dim? Which is
our principle ticket in the female line?
Eh, Dim?"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! Down Fourth Street,
Massa. De old genelman in New
York, and de lady at home by herself!
De High-Golly!"</p>

<p>"Vest, Dim. The new black vest,
which, last night, came home from
the tailor. What hour will the creditors
be here?"</p>

<p>"Dey comes in that ar door&mdash;"
observed Endymion, pointing to the
door on the right of the western window&mdash;"And,
accordin' to your directions,
dey is shown into dat door,
which conducts 'em into de large saloon,
where dere's fire to warm their
hands, and cheers to rest their bodies&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hallo, Dim, there's a tap at the
door&mdash;" exclaimed Fitz-Cowles, as,
arrayed in the full splendor of his
morning costume, with a gaudy silk
wrapper, all broken out into spots of
green, blue, and red, thrown round
his limbs, he resumed his seat in the
easy chair, beside the breakfast table&mdash;"I
know the knock. It is Count
Common Sewer&mdash;show him in."</p>

<p>Opening the door near the western
window, Dim made a profound bow,
as he ushered the visitor into the presence
of Col. Fitz-Cowles.</p>

<p>"De Editaw ob de Daily Black
Mail. Mistaw Poodle, sah&mdash;Buzby
Poodle&mdash;s-a-h!"</p>

<p>"Ha-ha! Curnel&mdash;<i>Bon jour</i>, as
we say in French. Seen the Black
Mail this morning. Capital <i>on dit</i>
about your gold mines&mdash;quite the
thing&mdash;<i>ensemble de chose</i>, as we say
in domestic French&mdash;"</p>

<p>As he spoke, Buzby Poodle, Esq.,
stood bowing and scraping in the centre

<!-- page 134 col 2 -->

of the vacant space of carpet, extending
before the breakfast table.
Buzby Poodle wasn't handsome. Not
precisely. He was a little thickset
man, with a short heavy body, shaped
something like a pine-knot, and irregular
legs, fashioned like a pair of inverted
parentheses, or like a pair of
sickles with their backs placed together.
It must be confessed that his
legs were deplorably knock-kneed nearly
acquainted with each other at the
knees, and quite distant in their intercourse
at the feet. Buzby's feet were
not small; Douzzle the bootmaker has
been heard to say, with evident pain,
that he would just as soon make slippers
for a young hippopotamus, as boots
for Buzby. You could not positively
say that Buzby's hands were small, or
delicate, or decently aristocratic. Very
short in the fingers, and very thick
across the palm and back, Buzby's
hands reminded you of a terrapin's
fin; they were such peculiar hands.</p>

<p>Buzby's face wasn't handsome. It
may have been expressive, or intellectual,
but it was not handsome.
Looking upon his countenance, you
were aware of the presence of a saffron
lump of flesh, with a small projection
in the centre for a nose, a delicate
gash below this projection for a mouth,
and two faint stripes of whity-brown
hair, in the way of eyebrows. His
eyes, looking from beneath the brows,
without the intervention of anything
you might call an eyelid, had a deplorable
half-cooked appearance, very
much like the visual organs of a salt
mackerel, roasting on the griddle. A
delicate strand of forehead, about half
an inch in width, was agreeably relieved
by a dense thicket of curly

<!-- page 135 col 1 -->

brown hair. There were mysterious
rumors about town with regard to this
luxuriant hair. Several of Buzby's
intimates had been observed to smile,
when the ladies complimented him on
his delightful curls; Pettitoes, the wig
maker, always grew mysterious when
Poodle's head of hair was called in
question, and once&mdash;but that was on
a drinking party, when Pettitoes' intellects
were muddled&mdash;he had said,
with a melo-dramatic scowl, that
"there was some people in this 'ere
world as stuck 'emselves up mighty
high, and yet wore dead people's&mdash;hum&mdash;he
wouldn't say <i>what</i> they
wore&mdash;but they wore dead people's&mdash;hum&mdash;he
could tell <i>what</i>."</p>

<p>The general contour of his face was
so singular, and&mdash;to use a word
which he delighted to repeat on every
occasion&mdash;so <i>unique</i>, that Coddle St.
Giles, the celebrated miniature painter,
who, having been honored with the
patronage of Queen Victoria, had
painted the whole royal family from
Her Majesty down to the lap-dog;
said, with a painful grimace, that he
had never experienced such extraordinary
feelings as came over him, when
portraying Buzby on costly ivory,
but once before in his life, and that&mdash;to
use Coddle's delicious cockney dialect&mdash;"wos
when the Royal Menageries
had visited my native town,
and I 'ad the extr'onery <i>h</i>onor to depict
the lineaments of the female Hourang-Houtang."</p>

<p>Altogether, Buzby Poodle, Esq.,
was an extraordinary man; something
out of the common run of men;
a specimen of that high pressure style
of editorial genius which the Quaker

<!-- page 135 col 2 -->

City admires and loves, to the bottom
of its universal heart.</p>

<p>"Like that hint about your gold
mines&mdash;eh, Curnel?" observed Buzby,
flinging his cloak on a chair, and
seating himself beside the breakfast
table&mdash;"Nice steak for breakfast.
Quite <i>recherch&eacute;</i>&mdash;as we say in
French. Don't care if I do take a
pull with you. Get me a plate,
Dim&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why Buzby, this will <i>do</i>; yes
certainly&mdash;" observed Fitz-Cowles,
stirring his spoon in the coffee, while
he glanced over the pages of the Daily
Black Mail&mdash;"But what a bad
smell your paper has! Quite an odor.
The <i>patchoully</i>, Dim. Now get a
plate for Count Common Sewer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are <i>so</i> jocular&mdash;" exclaimed
Buzby with a pleasant laugh&mdash;"You
have such a quantity of fun about you!
'Count Common Sewer&mdash;' ha, ha,
Good! You like that <i>on dit</i>, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Buzby, but you must touch
'em up to-morrow, about the mysterious
stranger at the Ton House; supposed
to be the son of an English Earl;
<i>perhaps</i> a Prince. <i>You</i> know, my
boy?"</p>

<p>"Don't I!" exclaimed Buzby
taking up Fitz-Cowles' toast between
his fingers&mdash;"It takes me&mdash;<i>Il
pris moi</i>&mdash;as we say in Domestic
French&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now Buzby&mdash;" exclaimed Fitz-Cowles,
fixing his dark eyes on the
unmeaning face of the Editor, with a
look, that made the little fellow tremble
in his shoes&mdash;"You know I pay
you, well, for these little advertisements.
As a matter of course, you
have some knowledge of my affairs;

<!-- page 136 col 1 -->

little knowledge, very little, but you
might use it some day to my injury.
What security have I that you will not
do so?"</p>

<p>"What security! Good Heaven's,
Curnel!" cried Buzby rising from his
chair&mdash;"Can you suspect me? This
is <i>too</i> much&mdash;" and Poodle's voice
grew quite pathetic&mdash;"Why Curnel,
to show what are my feelings toward
you, I will now place myself completely
in your power&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As how?"</p>

<p>Buzby made no reply, but striding
with a cautious step, to every door in
the room, he assured himself that they
were fast locked and secured; and
then with an air of the deepest mystery
approached Fitz-Cowles, and gazed
steadily in his face.</p>

<p>"What the d&mdash;l do you mean?"
exclaimed Fitz-Cowles, as he observed
the boiled mackerel eyes fixed upon
his countenance.</p>

<p>"There, there, I'm in your power.
The secret's out. Nobody knows it
but myself and wife. Now you know
it too. You can ruin me if you like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What in the d&mdash;l do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, why&mdash;" exclaimed Buzby
fingering away at his curly hair&mdash;"<i>I
wear a wig!</i>"</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha! Ha!"roared Fitz-Cowles,
as Poodle stood before him,
holding his head of hair in his hand&mdash;"Ha!
Ha! Ha! Count Common
Sewer you do look like old Jocko, the
Wonderful Ape&mdash;whom they exhibited
sometime ago at the Masonic Hall!
Oh, Jupiter&mdash;I shall die! Ha! Ha!
Ha! <i>That</i> head&mdash;<i>that</i> head!"</p>

<p>It was not the most solemn sight
in the world. There stood Buzby,

<!-- page 136 col 2 -->

calm and solemn, his luxuriant head
of hair extended in his right hand,
while the outline of his <i>real</i> head,
clothed with a short, wiry stubble of
<i>real</i> hair, became painfully distinct
in the light of the morning sun.</p>

<p>"And how is this, to place you in
my power?" asked Fitz-Cowles, after
his laughter had subsided to a quiet
chuckle&mdash;"Oh, Jupiter! <i>that</i> head!
Buzby, do put on your wig, or you'll
drive me into convulsions&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How is this to place me in your
power?" exclaimed Poodle in a half-offended
tone, as he resumed his curly
head of hair&mdash;"Would I figure so
largely behind the scenes of the Theatre,
if the <i>ballet</i> girls knew I wore a
wig? Curse it, the very <i>supes</i> would
laugh at me, and the scene-shifters
would not hesitate to jeer me! Fitz-Cowles,
it may seem foolish to you,
who have no such feelings of a tender
nature, but&mdash;but&mdash;my whole existence
is wound up in that head o' hair&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The deuce it is! Why, Poodle, you
didn't know that it was flung into my
plate last night at Monk-Hall&mdash;did
you?"</p>

<p>"Was it, though? Then I must
have been drunk&mdash;" exclaimed Buzby,
with a look of the deepest mortification.
"That accounts for the peculiar
'sticky' state of my hair this morning&mdash;You
think any of the fellows,
noticed it?"</p>

<p>"Too drunk for that, Buzby! By-the-bye,
you must have had a great
many 'tender adventures' in your time?
Eh, Poodle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hallo, Massa, open dis here
door&mdash;" the voice of Endymion, who
had been down stairs in search of a

<!-- page 137 col 1 -->

plate for Buzby, was heard in the entry&mdash;"I
hab got de plate for 'Common
Sewer'&mdash;"</p>

<p>In a moment the door was opened,
and Dim entered with a plate and some
additional refreshments; which having
been placed upon the table, Fitz-Cowles
and Buzby resumed their
breakfast.</p>

<p>" 'Tender adventures?' " cried Poodle,
masticating a piece of toast as he
dropped his knife and fork&mdash;"D'ye
see that?"</p>

<p>He drew a small pocket Bible, from
his bosom as he spoke, and displayed
it complacently, before the eyes of the
astonished Fitz-Cowles. It was corpulent
with letters, inserted between the
leaves, like so many anchovies, between
various thin slices of bread-and-butter.</p>

<p>"This rather goes a-head of the
wig! What may it mean, Buzby?"</p>

<p>"Don't you see, I keep all my love
letters, in the Bible? Ah, me! If I
wasn't married! Well, well, it can't
be helped! But these letters might
tell a strange tale&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let them tell it by all means&mdash;"
observed Fitz-Cowles; and Buzby pushing
his chair back from the table,
and displaying his legs very wide
apart, laid the pocket Bible on one
knee, and commenced a soliloquy
something after the fashion.</p>

<p>"That's from a delightful creature,
Curnel&mdash;" he observed, turning over
one of the leaves of the Bible, and extracting
a letter&mdash;"She loves me. Of
course, I had to be complaisant. Faint
heart never won fair lady&mdash;<i>Le c&oelig;ur
ennuy&eacute; ne jamais pas engag&eacute; la
belle blanche</i>&mdash;as we say in French.
That's from a vocalist&mdash;that from an

<!-- page 137 col 2 -->

actress&mdash;and that&mdash;ah! Curnel there's
a mystery about it!"</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"It's from an unknown lady. I've
tried to find out her name through the
clerks of the Post Office, but in vain.
She's a Southern Planter's daughter,
Curnel. Rich, beautiful, just seventeen.
Offers me her hand&mdash;don't
know I'm booked. Ah me! it would
make the tears come into your eyes
if I was to read this letter; there, Curnel,
is a lock of her hair&mdash;"</p>

<p>And Buzby, with a look of subdued
melancholy, slowly unfolded the letter,
and held up in the sunlight a lock of
reddish, brownish hair, which, long
and slender, looked amazingly like a
patent whip lash.</p>

<p>Fitz-Cowles preserved the gravity
of his face with considerable difficulty,
while the Creole, Endymion, who
stood at Poodle's shoulder, placed his
hands alternately to his mouth and
the pit of his stomach, as though he
was suffering under intermitting attacks
of the cholera and toothache.</p>

<p>Buzby sate in the full light of the
morning sun, holding the lock of hair,
extended in his right hand, while his
other hand absently grasped the pocket
Bible.</p>

<p>"You see she is a noble girl&mdash;"
he exclaimed, gazing fixedly upon the
lock of hair, with a glance of painful
melancholy&mdash;"Loves me. Spoke of
my early struggles in her letter.
Asked me if the world hadn't been
hard with me&mdash;if the iron grasp of
persecution hadn't been on my
shoulder, ever since the days of slips
and pap-spoons&mdash;if it didn't gall me
considerable to think my genius wasn't
appreciated&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 138 col 1 -->

<p>Buzby paused, and with a look of
tender melancholy, jerked the pinkish
lock of hair up and down, as a carter
'cracks' his whip.</p>

<p>The action was too much for Fitz-Cowles.
He burst into a roar of laughter,
while Dim, the Creole, went rolling
over the floor, holding his hands to
his side, as though he was laboring
under an epileptic fit.</p>

<p>"Curse me if I see any reason for
laughing in this manner&mdash;" exclaimed
Buzby, rising angrily from his seat&mdash;"That's
a very singular boy of yours,
Curnel. D&mdash;n him, he lays there
wriggling like a snake&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha! Ha! This is <i>too</i>
good&mdash;" roared Fitz-Cowles&mdash;"Of
course, I had no hand in writing that
letter&mdash;" he muttered to himself&mdash;"Get
up, Dim, and behave yourself!"</p>

<p>"Massa, dis quite convulses us&mdash;it
does&mdash;he! he! he!" exclaimed Dim,
rising to his feet&mdash;"Massa didn't send
me to the barber, nor nothing, to buy
dat hair?" he chuckled, in a whisper
inaudible to Buzby's ears&mdash;"Dim
didn't take de letter to de Pos' Offis?
De High-Golly!"</p>

<p>"This is quite a tender affair&mdash;<i>Il
est une affaire tendre</i>&mdash;as we say
in domestic French&mdash;" exclaimed
Buzby, resuming his seat, with this
sentiment in his peculiarly detestable
French&mdash;" 'Pon honor, Curnel&mdash;it's
a fact. The girl&mdash;the unknown&mdash;loves
me devotedly. I should suppose
that she read my&mdash;paper. How
d'ye feel after the bruise last night?"</p>

<p>"Capital. I intend to have some
fun this morning. You see my Governor
hasn't sent me the usual quarterly
remittance. My creditors have
been hunting me down for the last

<!-- page 138 col 2 -->

fortnight. I have been attacked in the
street, assaulted in the Theatre, besieged
in my Hotel. As a last resort,
I appointed a day for each of them to
call and see me; and even named the
hour. Of course each creditor is ignorant
of the fact, that I have made
the same appointment, with every one
of his fellow blood-suckers. It happens
to-day at ten o'clock, in the next
room&mdash;this glorious family party!"</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha! Ha!" laughed Buzby
Poodle&mdash;"This beats some insolvent
schedules quite hollow! I say <i>some</i>&mdash;because
I've had a little business in
that line myself. Out of curiosity&mdash;mind
ye&mdash;only from curiosity, I have
looked over some of the schedules in
the court, devoted to such interesting
affairs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you discovered something
rich, I s'pose?"</p>

<p>"The old proverb says 'a man is
known by the company he keeps'&mdash;<i>comprenez-vous
un homme par ses
compagnons du voyage</i>&mdash;as we say
in domestic French. Now I'm of
the opinion that a man is known by
his insolvent schedule. There's a
schedule filed in the proper court,
under the delicate nose of their Honors,
which says queer things for the character
of its signer. One day he went
round town&mdash;the jolly dog&mdash;getting
seven coats&mdash;<i>on credit</i>, mind ye&mdash;from
seven tailors; rings from this
jeweller and breast-pins from that;
boots by the quantity, and hats by the
half-dozen; in short, there was scarcely
a store in Chestnut Street that he
didn't <i>do</i>; not a credulous merchant&mdash;ha,
ha, ha!&mdash;but was diddled by him,
on this remarkable day&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well, what was the result?"</p>

<!-- page 139 col 1 -->

<p>"One day, like a clock, he went
exclusively 'on tick:' the next day the
clock stopped going. It was wound up
to some considerable extent. The
creditors look blue. Their 'friend and
pitcher' <i>took the Bankrupt Law!</i>"</p>

<p>"De High-Golly! By de way dat
chap tells de story, one 'ud think he
did all dat his ownsef! Ha&mdash;hah!"</p>

<p>"Buzby, your paper must make
you some considerable amount of
'<i>l'argent</i>.' How d'ye manage the
'Daily Black Mail?' "</p>

<p>This question appealed to the noblest
sympathies of Poodle's heart. He
rose slowly from his seat, he glanced
round with an expression of condescending
pride, and his face became
radiant with a sudden enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"How do I manage the 'Daily
Black Mail?' " he exclaimed, extending
his right fin, in the manner of a
stump-orator, who wishes to enrapture
a mass meeting, consisting of a few
dirty boys, one loafer, and two small
dogs&mdash;"I do it a little in the footpad
line. A big motto at the paper's head&mdash;'<i>Fiat
justitia</i>'&mdash;you know the
rest. Do I want the cash? I stick
in an article charging some well-known
citizen with theft, or seduction,
or some more delightful crime. Citizen
comes down in a rage&mdash;wants the
article contradicted in next day's
paper. He <i>pays</i> for the contradiction,
of course. I have known a mere <i>on
dit</i> that so-and-so, had committed a
'hideous crime,' to bring me in as
much as a cool hundred at a 'lick&mdash;' "</p>

<p>"How do you manage to acquire
so much favor with the 'sex?' "</p>

<p>"Take the Theatre, for instance.
A new actress appears. Suppose her
virtuous&mdash;or silly. I make advances.

<!-- page 139 col 2 -->

She foolishly repels me: very likely
calls me a&mdash;puppy. Next day an
<i>on dit</i> appears in 'Black Mail,' headed,
'Licentiousness of the stage,' and
embracing some compassionate allusion
to the lady aforesaid. You understand?
I damage her reputation
by a paragraphical slur&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And she capitulates?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes; and sometimes she
don't. But I keep up this delightful
fire of genteel insinuations, delicate
allusions, and spicy <i>on dits</i>. If the
girl's character is ruined, it isn't my
fault, I'm sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's quite refreshing to hear you
talk in this way. Are not times pretty
dull with you now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, yes! Hasn't been a
suicide for a week. Not even a murder
down town, nor a nigger baby
killed. I do wish something lively
would spring up for Christmas&mdash;now
an 'abduction case' with the proper
trimmings, would go it with a rush!
<i>Allez avec une furie</i>&mdash;as we say in
domestic French!"</p>

<p>"How d'ye stand with the other
papers?"</p>

<p>"Guess&mdash;when I tell you one
slight circumstance. They regard
my paper as a sort of literary <i>galleys</i>,
in which every aspirant for fame, must
serve his time. An author, who has
once been connected with my sheet, is
regarded as a convict all his life, by
the rest of the world newspaporial.
Good phrase that!"</p>

<p>"D'ye edit your paper, by yourself?"</p>

<p>"Bless you, no! I know a trick
worth two o' that&mdash;<i>Je comprend un
artifice double-la</i>&mdash;as we say in domestic
French. Whenever I find an

<!-- page 140 col 1 -->

author in extreme distress&mdash;rather
out of pocket, you know?&mdash;I take
him into my office; give him a dog's
salary, and make him do a dog's
work."</p>

<p>"Dog's work, indeed! If he assists
in getting up your paper!" was
the murmured remark of Fitz-Cowles.</p>

<p>"Should he leave me&mdash;and they
always do leave me after a month or
so&mdash;I libel him on every occasion,
and talk about 'ingratitude'&mdash;ha, ha,
ha! But the poor devil, can never get
rid of the crime of having been connected
with my paper! <i>That</i> sticks
to him, like 'original sin' to a Puritan!"</p>

<p>"Well, Buzby, you have given me
some fresh ideas about newspapers&mdash;"
observed Fitz-Cowles&mdash;"I thought I
knew them like a book! You have
given me a new wrinkle!"</p>

<p>He said this and gazed silently into
the saffron face of Buzby Poodle.</p>

<p>Oh, glorious Liberty of the Press,
let us take the opportunity afforded by
this quiet moment, and chaunt a psalm
in your praise! Oh, glorious Press,
what a comfort it must be to you, to
think and feel in your inmost heart,
that Buzby Poodle who sits smiling in
yonder chair, is no reality, no fact;
but a mere fictitious impersonation of
all the evils, which spring around your
life, and darken your existence!</p>

<p>Oh, magnificent Quaker City, with
your warehouses, and your Churches,
your Theatres and your Brothels,
your Banks and your Insane Hospitals,
your Loan Companies and your Alms
Houses, how delightful to all your denizens,
must be the reflection that
Buzby Poodle's no living nuisance,

<!-- page 140 col 2 -->

but an airy, though loathsome creation
of the author's brain!</p>

<p>Nursed from his very infancy in the
purlieus of the dance-house; an associate
of the ruffian and the courtezan,
from his earliest childhood; crawling
from the pages of his foul journal,
over the fairest reputations in the community;
sneering at the character of
this man's virtuous wife; blasting
with his leprous pen, that man's stainless
child; in his person and soul, one
hideous blot and breathing deformity;
an ulcer cankering over the bosom
of society; a bravo who stabs for his
dollar; a hireling who without character,
without reputation, without even
a name, prowls abroad, selling his
sheet, to any man that will buy it, for
any purpose under heaven; a tolerated
infamy; an uncaged jail-bird, an
unconvicted felon&mdash;&mdash;oh, Glorious,
Quaker City, does it not make your
moral heart grow warm, when you
remember that a creature, despicable
as this, has no existence in fact,
but is only a fancy of the author, a
fiction of his brain!</p>

<p>Other cities may have their abominations
in the shape of a licentious
press, with marketable Editors, who
have in their time, pursued every honest
occupation, from body-snatching
up to newspaper publishing; but the
Quaker City, like the Ideal town of
some far-off El Dorado, is so pure, so
spotless, that an Author in search of
a cut-throat Editor, by the portraiture
of whose character, he means to throw
a dark relief around the brighter portions
of his pages, must set his wits to
work, and <i>invent, a Buzby Poodle!</i></p>

<p>Oh, rare invention&mdash;Buzby Poodle&mdash;long
may it be, ere a thing like you,

<!-- page 141 col 1 -->

shall start into tangible existence, and
all be-wigged and sickle-legged, walk
visibly along Chestnut Street; a diminutive
incarnation of a most nauseous
emetic.</p>

<p>"Go to the door, Dim! There's the
first of the Creditors! Be quiet, Poodle
and enjoy the fun&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes Massa, I opens the door&mdash;"
cried Endymion as the hoarse voice of
Creditor One, was heard in the next
room.</p>

<p>"Tell Col. Fitz-Cowles, that Mr.
Bluffly Bulk wants to see him."</p>

<p>And as the hoarse voice echoed
through the aperture, Mr. Bluffly Bulk,
appeared in the doorway, driving an
immense paunch before him, as he
walked along. His small head overlooked
his immense corporation, like a
pea observing the circumference of a
pumpkin.</p>

<p>"Well, Fitz-Cowles&mdash;" said Mr.
Bulk&mdash;"I've called according to appointment.
You owe me a fee in the
case of 'Commonwealth vs. Fitz-Cowles'&mdash;charge,
lathering a watchman.
The fee is 'fifty.' Pay it, and
let me go&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do me the kindness to step this
way&mdash;" exclaimed Fitz-Cowles with
one of his best bows as he motioned
Creditor One, toward the small door,
opposite&mdash;"In a moment I'll see you;
And settle this little matter."</p>

<p>Bluffly Bulk Esq., disappeared within
the eastern door, muttering strange
curses as he walked along.</p>

<p>"Dar goes ten o'Cloc' Massa&mdash;"
exclaimed Dim listening at the key
hole of the western door&mdash;"De High-Golly!
I hear more of 'em in the nex'
room&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 141 col 2 -->

<p>"Show 'em in Dim! One at a
time! Ha! Whom have we here! My
friend Smith&mdash;John Smith the Upholster&mdash;"</p>

<p>A little thin man, with a narrow
face, a starved nose, and a green overcoat,
advanced and seized Fitz-Cowles
earnestly by the hand.</p>

<p>"Note to pay to-day Sir&mdash;" he
said in a thrilling whisper&mdash;"Bill for
the curtains, you got of me, when you
was at the United States Hotel&mdash;Six
hundred and fifty two dollars, twelve
and a half cents. Tight times Sir.
Money very scarce&mdash;shall I give you
a receipt Sir?&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In the next room if you please&mdash;"
observed Fitz-Cowles with a pleasant
smile&mdash;"You see my old fellow, we'll
fix that matter in a minute&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bress your eyes, Massa, dey are
a-growlin like cat-an'-dog in t'oder
room!" observed Dim holding the
door slightly open&mdash;"I hear's 'em a-comin'
up de stairs; and I hear's de
sarvant a-showin' 'em into the next
room&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This grows quite refreshing! Almost
equal to a Schedule at the Insolvent
Court!"</p>

<p>"Is Misther Fitz-Cow-<i>how</i>les, in the
house himself, jest? Be aisy thare ye
nager, and let me come in. Dhrop a
word into his private ear, that Michael
O'Flannagan, French Boot Maker
from Paris, is a-wantin' to get the
taste ov a sight ov him&mdash;"</p>

<p>And a large boned man, attired in
a shabby white great coat, with an old
fur cap drawn over his eyes, came
rushing into the room. He stood full
six feet in his stockings; and his red
face, seen through the apertures of his
hair and whiskers, all of the same

<!-- page 142 col 1 -->

burning red, looked very much like
the countenance of a man who won't
stand upon trifles; or occupy his time
in breaking the hind legs of a flea.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;the blazes! But them sixteen
pair of stairs give me a pain in
the side; the top o' th' marnin' to ye
Colonel&mdash;its yerself that's lookin'
like a canary bird the-day. Shall we
fingher the pewther Curnel? Cinshider
the seventeen pair o' boots, all
done and complated by Michael O'Flannagan,
French Boot Maker, from the
City o' Pari-i-s, in the ould Counthry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's got the real Parisian accent!"
exclaimed Buzby Poodle&mdash;"Talks
like a native. Quite <i>au fait!</i>"</p>

<p>"The accshent? And who the
divil should have the accshent, but me?
Wasn't I brot up all my life, a giniwine
Frenchman, and didn't my father
fight with ould Boney, in the
scrimmage of Watherloo?"</p>

<p>"You speak it like a native Mikey.
This way; I'll talk to you in minute.
Show 'em in, Dim."</p>

<p>"Mistaw Douzzle, de toder Boot
Maker from Paris!"</p>

<p>A mouldy looking man, of short
stature, and a heavy face, invested by
a dampish beard of some indefinable
color, was now shown into the room,
with his arms hanging straight by his
sides, like pendulums to some walking
clock.</p>

<p>"Curnel, I ish in want fery mosh
ov dat small bill for de French Boots.
Times is hardt; mine wife is sick, and
von childt has got de measles. Eight
pair of fine French Boots&mdash;seven dollars
a-pair&mdash;seven eight ish fordy-eight&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Next room Douzzle. See you in
a minute. Keep on showin' 'em in Dim!"</p>

<!-- page 142 col 2 -->

<p>"I 'ave the <i>h</i>onour, to present my
small bill&mdash;" exclaimed a little man
in a Cockney face, and brown sack
coat&mdash;"To one portrait of Col. Fitz-Cowles,
fifty dollars. Very much in
want of money, to-day Sir. Obliged
to you for a little. Never since I 'ad
the extron'ery <i>h</i>onor, to paint Her
Royal Majesty Victoria, and Prince
<i>Ha</i>lbert with the 'ouses o' Parliament
and the lap-dog in the background,
never since that 'ere blessed moment,
'ave I taken so much pains with a mini'ture
as with yours! Out of wood
sir&mdash;out of coal sir&mdash;out of ivory,
Sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not out of brass I hope? Ha!
Ha! Ha! There I had you St. Giles!
Walk into the next room if you please!
Pass 'em this way, Dim!"</p>

<p>And Dim did pass them that way to
some considerable extent. It should
be borne in mind, that Col. Fitz-Cowles
had been living for some time past in
a style of princely splendor, kept up
and supported by a numerous retinue
of credulous tradesmen. The results
of this princely style, now manifested
themselves in the shape of some four-and-thirty
creditors, who came pouring
from the ante-room, one after another,
in quick succession, with their
bills in hand, and their demands ringing
loudly on the air, like a delightful
chorus to the grand drama of the
Bankrupt law.</p>

<p>"A small bill for horse hire. To a
chaise and four&mdash;" began a little thickset
man, with brown whiskers, and a
short bang-up, smelling strongly of
the race-course&mdash;"To a chaise and
four, seventeen times&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My little bill for ten coats, fifteen
pair of pants&mdash;fourteen vests and a

pressing hurriedly forward&mdash;"Firm

and Co. Five hundred and fifty dol&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I 'ave furnish you with parfumerie,
to dis amount&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Seventy one pair of gloves. White

<p>"To the use of my cab, Gineral

<p>"<i>To</i>, the 'Genelman's Universal

<p>"My bill for Dry Goods, sir&mdash;"
said a pompous man, with a snub nose
and immense ragged whiskers
"McWhiley Mumshell, sir. Two
hundred and six&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>" 'Pothecary's bill for med'cine.
Seven bottles Swain's Panacea&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;ha! This beats the Insolvent
Court! What a scene for the
next Black Mail!"</p>

<p>"De High-Golly! Dey come wid
a parfac looseness, dis time!"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, gentle-<i>men</i>&mdash;" exclaimed
Fitz-Cowles, looking from
face to face with a pleasant smile&mdash;"You
are really too impatient. To
see you rushing forward in this style,
one would think I had the wealth of
Girard in my pockets. Step into the
next room, gentlemen. All your demands
shall be satisfied&mdash;"</p>

<p>A murmur of satisfaction burst from
the contrasted throng, and in an instant
they had all disappeared into the next
room.</p>

<p>"Now, Buzby, let's wait a few
minutes, until they begin to grow
feverish. When I think they've worked
themselves up into the proper humor,

<!-- page 143 col 2 -->

we'll step in, and take a look at
them. I'll show you how to bluff off
a creditor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought I was rather <i>au fait</i> at

<p>CHAPTER SECOND.</p>

<p class="small">FITZ-COWLES AND HIS CREDITORS.</p>

</div>

<p>IN a large saloon, furnished in a
style of magnificence, popularly known
as the gingerbread style, with immense
red silk curtains along the
windows, scattered patches of gilt,
glittering around the cornices, and a
colossal mirror above the mantle, sate
the four-and-thirty creditors, waiting
for the appearance of the <i>millionaire</i>.</p>

<p>The softened light which came
through the drawn curtains, gave a
mild and shadowy effect to the figures
of the patient band, while it was quite
delightful to witness the animated expression
of their countenances, as
gazing into each other's eyes, they
seemed to wonder why in the deuce
they were all penned up there together,
like various kinds of cattle at an
Agricultural fair.</p>

<p>Bluffly Bulk, Esq., the fat lawyer sat
glaring upon the little bootmaker,
Douzzle, as though he was wondering
what kind of a 'fry' the fellow would
make for his breakfast; Michael
O'Flannagan, the Parisian bootmaker,

<!-- page 144 col 1 -->

was engaged in polishing his shoes on
the handsome hearth-rug; Coddle St.
Giles, gazed vacantly around with the
look of a man who has been feloniously
decoyed into a den of thieves, while
the rest of the four-and-thirty creditors
were occupied in examining their
various bills, which they raised frequently
in the light; and crushed between
their fingers, as though the
action was productive of great peace
of mind and tranquility of spirit.</p>

<p>A buz-buz of satisfaction, resounded
through the saloon.</p>

<p>Col. Fitz-Cowles appeared in the
doorway with Buzby Poodle, and Endymion
at his back.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen&mdash;" said the Colonel,
placing one hand between his back
and his flashy morning-robe, while he
waved the other gently up and down&mdash;"I
owe you money&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> you do&mdash;" muttered Bluffly
Bulk, Esq., stamping his cane on
the floor; and a buz-buz from the four-and-thirty
creditors, confirmed the
truth of the sentiment. It was quite
pleasing to see how much unanimity
of feeling existed on this point. Had
there been only half the concurrence
of opinion, visible in the doings of most
of our religious conventions, synods
and conferences, the world would have
been Christianized long ago.</p>

<p>"I owe you money and I mean to
pay it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> manes to pay it! Hurra!
Three times, hur-rah.!"</p>

<p>"I mean to make your fortunes. I
should suppose you all want money
rather bad?"</p>

<p>"Deuced bad." "Cursed bad."
"Och, don't I?" "Wife and children&mdash;one
sick with the measles." "Starvation."

<!-- page 144 col 2 -->

"Go to jail." "Out of
wood, out of coal, out of ivory."</p>

<p>"If I don't pay you this morning I
suppose it will ruin you all?"</p>

<p>"Totally." "Have to leave the
city." "Can't think on't." "Horrible."
"Och whillaloo!" "Ruin me,
root and branch!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, gentlemen, I <i>will</i>
make your fortunes. You have a
pleasing countenance, my friend Bluffly
Bulk, a respectable person. You
shall oversee the hands. Yes, yes.
That 'ill just suit you. Mister Flannagan,
imagine yourself perched on
the edge of a well, some hundred
fathoms deep, telling the laborers below
to mind their eyes and be d&mdash;d
to 'em. 'Hoist away my hearties'&mdash;d'ye
take? Coddle St. Giles, your
remarkable talents will here be called
into requisition. You can take drawings
of the mines&mdash;publish 'em when
we all get back&mdash;splendid volume&mdash;letter
press by Sylvester J. Petriken,
of the Western Hem. Flunk, my dear
friend Flunk, of the firm of Flunk,
Checkley &amp; Co., Merchant Tailors,
you can make up a lot of clothes for
the miners! 'Gad gents, I like the
plan altogether; it will suit our various
talents. It will make our fortunes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gintlemen, me name is Mikey
O'Flannagan, Bootmaker, from Parris,
and me father fought with ould
Boney, and so ye see there's some
larnin' in our family, but may the
divil fly away wid me, if I can make
out what the Curnel manes&mdash;By
Julias Caysar, but we're all a-listenin'
to a gintleman from the Insane Hozpittal!"</p>

<p>"What in the d&mdash;l do you mean?"
exclaimed Bluffly Bulk, growing like

<!-- page 145 col 1 -->

a turkey-cock in the face as he fixed
his eyes upon Fitz-Cowles, who stood
in the centre of the saloon, in an
attitude of deep abstraction&mdash;"Be <i>so</i>
kind as to explain yourself!"</p>

<p>"Yes the plan is feasible&mdash;" exclaimed
Colonel Fitz-Cowles elevating
his eyebrows with an absent stare&mdash;"But
there's a rough desert to pass
through before we reach the mines.
Plenty of Mexicans and Texans&mdash;not
to mention the Indians and wild
beasts. Still the mines are productive:
on my father's estate you know? I'm
<i>incog:</i> just now, but when the Company
is in full operation, under the
combined patronage of Santa Anna
the Mexican government, and Sam
Houston, I'll make known the old man's
name&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir&mdash;" cried Bluffly Bulk in a
voice of thunder&mdash;"Will you tell us
what you mean?"</p>

<p>"Arrah, man, and be quick at it!"</p>

<p>"Oblige us with some slight knowledge&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Guess he wants a straight-jacket."</p>

<p>"Tell you what I mean?" exclaimed
Fitz-Cowles, starting from his reverie&mdash;"With
pleasure. You see
gentlemen, I propose to make your
fortunes, by allowing you to enter
your names, as stockholders of 'the
Grand Montezuma Gold-Mining Company
of the gold mines of Huancatepapetel,
district of Tolpcaptl, South
Mexico&mdash;Algernon Fitz-Cowles, <i>President</i>,
Bluffly Bulk, <i>Secretary</i>, Board
of Directors as follows&mdash;' you can fill
up the blank at your leisure you know?
I will allow you, each to take ten shares
of the capital stock at $100 per share;
and we will say nothing about the small
turns I owe you. Mere trifles you

<!-- page 145 col 2 -->

know. Bluffly, in consideration of
the post of Secretary, being tendered
you, one hundred shares, will be the
smallest number, you can be permitted
to take&mdash;"</p>

<p>Fitz-Cowles paused, and looked
around to note the effects of his important
proposition. There was a dead
silence in the Saloon. You might have
heard a pin drop. The four and thirty
Creditors, looked into one another's
faces, but said nothing. Buzby Poodle
and Dim the Creole, concealed
themselves among the window curtains,
which quivered and shook, as
with a sudden convulsion.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen d'ye like my proposition?"
said Fitz-Cowles blandly&mdash;"Is
it feasible? We can all go to
Huancatepapetel together; times are
<i>so</i> hard in this city. Those that are
married can take their families with
them; those that are single, will get
families soon enough on their arrival
at the mines. You are silent&mdash;it is
with surprise I suppose? Or d'ye
want to advance some small amount
on your shares? No gentlemen. I
can't think of <i>that!</i> The trifles I owe
you one and all, will more than pay,
for your shares&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, may I be rammed into a
shot gun, and fired off at a nigger riot,
if this isn't the coolest thing I've
heard of for some time!" and as he
spoke the fat lawyer started from his
feet, and confronted Fitz-Cowles&mdash;"Zounds
Sir, what do you take me
for?"</p>

<p>"A fine fat old gentleman&mdash;" replied
Fitz-Cowles bowing&mdash;"Who
would make a Capital Superintendent
of the mines. By Jupiter! Bluffly,
that person of yours carries respectability

<!-- page 146 col 1 -->

in its every outline. It is worth
at least a-thousand shares to the company&mdash;"</p>

<p>The storm, long-gathering and silent
in its growth, burst suddenly over the
head of Fitz-Cowles. One and all the
four and thirty Creditors rose, one and
all they poured forth their anger in
broken words and bitter curses.</p>

<p>"J&mdash;s the villain!&mdash;" "The scoundrel&mdash;"
"Swindler&mdash;" "This is
wot I gits for his mini'tur'!&mdash;" "I'm
paid for the fifteen coats and&mdash;"
"Here's the cash for my gloves!"
"Tish is damdt pat&mdash;my wife sick
and de shildren got de measles&mdash;"
"Hurrah! Lets whack into im!"</p>

<p>"This beats an Insolvent Schedule
all hollow!" laughed Buzby Poodle,
peeping out from behind the curtains&mdash;"
'Gad! what a scene for the Black
Mail! Four and thirty Creditors, of
all shapes, sizes and patterns, surrounding
Fitz-Cowles, who greets 'em
with a commiserating smile! Ha&mdash;ha!
Capital!"</p>

<p>"De High-Golly!" shouted Dim
thrusting his head from the other curtain.
"Dey look as if dey eat Massa up
widout any pepper or salt!"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen&mdash;will you hear me!"
shouted Fitz-Cowles in a voice of thunder,
as he gazed upon the four and
thirty threatening faces&mdash;"Will you
or will you not? Am I to be insulted
in my own house? Dim&mdash;go and call
the servants, and have these fellows
trundled down stairs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well Sir, what do you propose?"
cried Bluffly Bulk, his voice rising
above the tumult&mdash;"No more humbug
Sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You then reject my offer, made
with the best feelings in the world, to

<!-- page 146 col 2 -->

combine you, one and all, into the
Grand Montezuma Gold-Mining Company
of the Huancatepapetel&mdash;"</p>

<p>" 'Huancatty-kettle-polly' be d&mdash;d!"
shouted Flunk the tailor pressing
forward, as he shook his clenched
hand in the air.</p>

<p>"Pitch 'Gwan-goett-polly' to the
divil!" screamed O'Flannagan the
Boot Maker.&mdash;</p>

<p>"Just as you like Gentlemen. Pitch
Huancatepapetel to the devil, by all
means. But I was about to observe
that the various sums, which I owe you
separately, taken in the lump, amount
to something over three thousand dollars.
You are interested. Well now,
my fellows here's the difficulty. I've
but a thousand dollars, cash in my
possession. You can divide it among
you, if you like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now you, <i>talk</i>&mdash;" observed Bluffly
Bulk, with a pleasing smile as
though the previous remarks of Fitz-Cowles
had not risen even to the dignity
of talk&mdash;"Of course my little
fee of fifty dollars, will be satisfied out
of this sum, in precedence to all other
claims&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Av course me little bill of thirty
sivin dollars, sixty cents&mdash;" observed
Mr. Flannagan, stepping briskly forward,
as he thrust his hands, deep into
the vacuum of his great coat pockets&mdash;"Will
take the prisidence of your thrifling
claims&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course, Curnel, my bill of two
hundred and fifty, for Dry Goods&mdash;"
mildly exclaimed McWhiley Mumshell,
pulling his ragged whiskers,
with a hand, all glittering with costly
rings&mdash;"My little bill will be considered,
first of all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And is it the likes of ye, to stand

<!-- page 147 col 1 -->

afore me? The divil dhrag me under
a harrow, but ould rat-face, ye've a dale
of impedence in them same whiskers."</p>

<p>"Curnel, don't forgit the min'itur'&mdash;"
"Nor the horse-hire&mdash;" "Remember
the gloves&mdash;" "Ishn't I to be paidt
for my poots?" "De parfumerie Monsieur
Viz-Cowle&mdash;" "Jist stand
back there, will ye&mdash;" "Devil take
your impudence&mdash;I'm as good as
you&mdash;" "Say that again&mdash;" "You're
another&mdash;" "My bill, Curnel&mdash;"
"<i>Mine</i> I say&mdash;" "Wife and five children,
won sick wid de measles&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen&mdash;<i>do</i> be calm&mdash;" cried
Fitz-Cowles as he viewed the gathering
storm&mdash;"Remember gentlemen,
that you <i>are</i> gentlemen. Be calm
Flannagan&mdash;Quiet yourself Bluffly&mdash;Soothe
your excited feelings Mumshell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you settle my bill&mdash;" shrieked
Bluffly Bulk, red in the face with
anger&mdash;"Yes or no!"</p>

<p>"Botherashin! Stand back auld porpise&mdash;and
let me give him a receipt&mdash;Or
is it a row ye've a-wantin'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"D&mdash;d Irishman&mdash;" grated Bluffly
between his teeth.</p>

<p>"D&mdash;d Irishman, am I? And me a
Paryshian barn? For the sake of my
ould man, who was an Irishman, and who
fit wid Boney at Watherloo&mdash;take <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>And with his clenched hand, he
aimed a blow, full at the immense corporation
of the fat lawyer. The blow
brushed Mumshell's whiskers and took
effect on the person of the lawyer.
The effect was terrific. In an instant
the four and thirty Creditors, their bills
in hand, were all mingled through
each other, every man striking the
man who stood next to him, without
regard to consequences, while Bluffly

<!-- page 147 col 2 -->

and Flannagan, went at it, tooth and
nail, exchanging fisticuffs with remarkable
good will.</p>

<p>The scene was peculiar. A forest
of fists, rising up and down, a mass
of angry faces, all mingled together,
some four and thirty bodies of all
sizes and descriptions, twisting and
winding about, with so much rapidity,
that they all looked like the different
limbs of some strange monster, undergoing
a violent epipletic fit.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen <i>do</i> be calm&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go your death&mdash;<i>Allez-vous votre
mort!</i>&mdash;as we say in domestic French!
Hit 'em again!&mdash;<i>frappez duex fois!</i>
That's it! Give him another!&mdash;<i>donnez

<p>"Damages, you ould porpise&mdash;then

<p>"Bi Gott! I vill murder somebodys

<p>"Let me up! It wasn't me that

<p>CHAPTER THIRD.</p>

<p class="small">THE DEATH WARRANT.</p>

</div>

<p>THE mirror, which hung above the
dressing bureau, reflected the handsome
form of Col. Fitz-Cowles. It
must be confessed that the Colonel
looked decidedly interesting, as standing
before the mirror, in the glare of
the morning sun, he surveyed his form
for the last time, ere he sallied forth
on Chestnut Street. His figure, with
its broad chest and tapering waist
was enveloped in a close-fitting overcoat
of dark cloth, which, falling open
along the breast, disclosed his black
scarf, gathered over his shirt front with
a plain gold pin, and tastefully disposed
within the collar of his glossy
coat and satin vest, whose jet black
hues were in harmony with the other
portions of his attire.</p>

<p>The dark visage of the Colonel,
relieved by long curling locks of jet-black
hair, was surmounted by an
elegant hat, remarkable for its conical
crown and width of brim. This was
the much admired and very aristocratic
'<i>Fitz-Cowles' hat</i>', worn by all the
distinguished bloods of the Quaker
City. Introduced by the gallant Colonel,
it soon became the rage, and was
at the time of which we write, the
standing test of fashion and elegance
among the exquisites of Chestnut Street.</p>

<p>"Dim&mdash;" said the Colonel, gently
waving the gold-headed cane, which
he held within the white-kid glove of
his right hand&mdash;"Are they <i>all</i> gone?"</p>

<p>"All turned out, Massa. De sarvants
tumble 'em down stairs more an
half-hour ago&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dim&mdash;" continued the Colonel,
impregnating his snow-white handkerchief

<!-- page 148 col 2 -->

with an additional scent
of <i>patchoully</i>*&mdash;"What's the damage?"</p>

<p class="small">[*A perfume, once the 'rage' among the
fashionables of our city. To the uninitiated
smells like a composition of Musk, cast-iron
filings and bad rain water.]</p>

debbil kicked up all ober de room&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Buzby&mdash;" resumed the Colonel,
passing a comb lightly through the
locks of his jet-black hair&mdash;"How did
you like it?"</p>

<p>"Quite <i>recherch&eacute;</i>. But won't they
sue you for their various debts?"</p>

<p>"Let them sue and be hanged!
The amount I owe them, applied in
the proper way, would command a
great influence in Court. Why man
I've got the price of seven judges, ten
juries and some score of lawyers, in
my pocket. These things are all for
sale&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! This is libellous! Hello!
There's a knock at the door&mdash;"</p>

<p>"See who it is, Dim&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dim opened the door at the extreme
end of the bedchamber. He gazed
for an instant through the aperture,
and then closing the door with a sudden
movement, he came running to
his Master's side, his eyes dilating
with surprise and his tawny face, pale
as Fitz-Cowles' white kid gloves.</p>

<p>"What in the deuce, is the matter
Dim?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Golly Massa! Oh Lor! Oh
de debbil!" cried the Creole, dancing
about the room.</p>

<p>"Shall I knock you down with the
chair you scoundrel? Or would you

<!-- page 149 col 1 -->

like to be held out of a fourth-story
window, by the heels, again?"</p>

<p>Dim approached his master's side,
and whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>The Colonel's face grew suddenly
pale, and a blasphemous oath escaped
from his lips.</p>

<p>"Buzby, go into the next room&mdash;"
he cried harshly, with the same tone,
he would use, in getting rid of a troublesome
dog&mdash;"Be quick. I have a
visitor, whom I must see alone. Why
do you stand there, staring in my face
like an idiot? Begone I say&mdash;I
must be alone&mdash;"</p>

<p>Buzby Poodle, disappeared through
the Saloon door, with a look of malignant
anger, that boded no good to
his friend, Colonel Fitz-Cowles.</p>

<p>"Open the door. D'ye hear Dim?"
shouted the Colonel, as his face grew
paler, and his dark eye, emitted a
clear flashing glance, that betokened
powerful though suppressed emotion.
"Show our visitor in&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dim opened the door, at the end of
the bedchamber, farthest from the windows,
and the visitor entered. It must
be confessed that the surprise which
the mere utterance of his name occasioned,
might be easily explained, when
the singular appearance of the new-comer,
was taken into consideration.</p>

<p>A short, thickset, little man, dressed
in a suit of glossy black cloth, advanced
from the open door. His face,
which from its remarkable length,
gave you the idea of a horse's head,
affixed to the remnant of a human body,
seemed to lay upon his heart,
while his shoulders arose on either
side, as high as his ears, and his back
protruding in a shapeless hump, was
visible above the outline of his head.</p>

<!-- page 149 col 2 -->

<p>His face, it is true, from its extreme
length, and the peculiar manner,
in which it seemed to lay on his breast,
might have appeared distorted and deformed,
yet were the features perfectly
regular, the nose a decided aquiline,
the mouth well-proportioned and indicative
of firmness, the chin, full and
round, while the high forehead, with
the dark eyebrows, over-arched two
large and brilliant eyes, whose intense
lustre beaming from a face, marked
by a clear, healthy complexion, gave
the beholder the idea, that he beheld a
supernatural, rather than a human
being.</p>

<p>Should the latter portion of this description,
appear overstrained, the reader
will remember, that the diminutive
stature of the strange visitor, the hump
on his back, and the manner in which
his face, seemed to rest on his chest,
all gave additional effect to the expression
of his face and eyes. '<i>Jew</i>,'
was written on his face as clearly and
distinctly as though he had fallen
asleep at the building of the Temple
at Jerusalem, in the days of Solomon,
the rake and moralist; and after a
nap of three thousand years, had
waked up in the Quaker City, in a
state of perfect and Hebraic preservation.</p>

<p>"You are, here, are you?" whispered
Fitz-Cowles in a tone of ungovernable
rage&mdash;"Why is this? Why
leave your hiding place in broad daylight?"</p>

<p>"I'ave comsh bekos I vanted to
comsh&mdash;" said the Jew, calmly, as
he folded his hands across his breast.</p>

<p>"You have, have you?" whispered
Fitz-Cowles, as the gleam of rage,
brightened in his dark eyes&mdash;"Do

<!-- page 150 col 1 -->

you know&mdash;you dog, you miserable
dog&mdash;that I've a great notion to give
you a taste of <i>this</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>And as he spoke, quick as thought,
he flung open the breast of his overcoat,
and drawing the Bowie knife,
from a secret pocket, he brandished it
above the head of the Jew, with a look
of ungovernable hatred.</p>

<p>"Puts away te carving-knifes&mdash;Puts
away te carving-knifes&mdash;" said the
humpback, with a bitter, though
scarcely perceptable sneer&mdash;"You
vill not hurts noboty."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will tell me, why you
have left your hiding place! In broad
day, with all the police at your heels?
Ha! Ha! This is delightful! Curse
<i>that</i> Devil-Bug&mdash;" he muttered as he
strode to the window&mdash;"How could
he have let this dog escape?"</p>

<p>"I tells you vy I'ave left dat nashty
plashe&mdash;" said the Hebrew in the
coolest manner imaginable&mdash;"Bekos
it vos a nashty plashe! Bekos dese
leetle hand do all te vorks&mdash;andt maybe
after all, you reaps te profit. I mosh
hide in dat hole&mdash;viles you valksh
Cheshnut Streets? Vos dat de kontraksh?
You keep your pargain, vill
yous?"</p>

<p>"And what was that bargain?" exclaimed
Fitz-Cowles again facing the
Jew.</p>

<p>"Ven te tings vos done, you vos to
gif me ten tousand tollars in goldt. I
vos to sail for Europes. Vot have
you done? Left me to rots among
roppers and tiefs, viles you walksh
Cheshnut Streets! Got-tam!"</p>

<p>The Jew sate down, or rather fixed
himself on the sofa, and looked up
calmly into the flushed countenance
of Fitz-Cowles.</p>

<!-- page 150 col 2 -->

<p>"Well, well, Von Gelt, lets shake
hands, and talk the mattter over&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We may talksh as mosh as we
pleashes, but we tont shake handts&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just as you like. Well, Judas&mdash;is
that your first name Von Gelt?"</p>

<p>"Supposh it vos my naturs? Vonder
how long afore the handsome
Curnels would be&mdash;Father Moses&mdash;I
know veres&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So you threaten, me, do you Gabriel?
Ha!-ha! This is amusing.
May I ask what you propose to do?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow mornings I vill take
te carsh for New Yorksh. Nex tay
I vill sail for Europes. To-tay, you
will gif me, ten tousandt tollars&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But Judas&mdash;that is Gabriel&mdash;Judas
for short, you know? You must
remember that I have not ten thousand
dollars in my possession&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Veres is te ole hair trunksh?"</p>

<p>"But Gabriel&mdash;" exclaimed Fitz-Cowles
in a conciliating tone, as he
seated himself, beside the table opposite
the Jew&mdash;"But Gabriel you know,
that it is impossible for us to have this
money, for months to come. The sovereigns
and the notes, might be recognized
at once. It is better to wait a
little while and make sure of the whole
sum beyond a chance of detection.
Pen and ink, Dim."</p>

<p>"Meanviles te poleesh ranshack

I vill bear tish no longers. Tish tay
I mosh ave ten tousandt tollars, or&mdash;or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or&mdash;or&mdash;" echoed Fitz-Cowles
as he scrawled a few words on a sheet
of gilt-edged note paper&mdash;"Or&mdash;or&mdash;You
was about to observe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"May be I can git ten tousandt tollars,

<!-- page 151 col 1 -->

someveres else&mdash;" said the Jew
with a meaning look.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;ha! You grow humorous,
Gabriel&mdash;" observed Fitz-Cowles with
a smile&mdash;"Please deliver this little
note to Devil-Bug if you should
chance to see him again, before you
start for Europe. Will you Gabby?"</p>

<p>"Ha! vot is tish!" exclaimed the
hump-backed Jew, as his eye glanced
over the note, which read as follows:</p>

<p>'Devil-Bug&mdash;Our friend leaves us to-morrow.
It is all right. Aid him as far
as you can, in anything that concerns his
departure. THE ABBOT.'</p>

<p>"Den you conshents?" exclaimed
Gabriel, with a smile of triumph&mdash;"You
vill gif me te monish?"</p>

<p>"Of course, <i>of course</i>. You know
I would never refuse you anything,
Gabriel. You must be careful though,
Gabriel, with the money. Mighty
careful&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Vot a fool I vos, ever to part mit
it!" muttered Gabriel&mdash;"I hadt it all
in mine own handts won time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me one moment, Gabriel,
while I write a note to my jeweller&mdash;"
said Fitz-Cowles, with a pleasant
smile. "Here, Dim&mdash;take this ring
and this note down to Melchior, the
Jeweller, in Fourth Street near Chestnut.
Hurry back, d'ye hear?"</p>

<p>As he seized the note and folded it,
Fitz-Cowles gazed smilingly in the
face of the Hebrew. But when he
took the diamond ring from his finger,
and handed it to Dim, with one quick
flashing glance of his dark eyes, the
smile deepened into an agreeable
laugh, and Fitz-Cowles looked, for all
the world, like a man whose mind is
unburdened by a single care. And

<!-- page 151 col 2 -->

this, while his life and fortune hung
upon the note which he handed to the
Creole!</p>

<p>"Dim&mdash;you understand? This
ring and note are for the Jeweller in
Fourth below Chestnut?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Massa&mdash;" answered Dim,
with a stolid and imperturbable expression
of countenance. "I'll be back
d'rectly."</p>

<p>That note was the Death Warrant
of the Jew.</p>

<p>Thus it read:</p>

<p>'Devil-Bug&mdash;When the Jew comes
back to Monk-Hall he will have about his
person ten thousand dollars. You can
pay yourself for the care and trouble you
have had with him. The ring will tell
you what I mean. THE ABBOT.'</p>

<p>"Now, Gabby&mdash;" exclaimed Fitz-Cowles,
as Dim hastened from the
room&mdash;"You can amuse yourself by
looking out of the window, while I get
you the money."</p>

<p>As the handsome Algernon, stooping
to the floor, drew the hair trunk
from beneath the sofa, Gabriel, the
Jew, rose from his seat and advanced
toward the window.</p>

<p>"Dere's noting like improvin' vons
times&mdash;" he muttered, as he seized an
object, which lay exposed on the top
of the dressing bureau. "Father
Moses! He vill swear ven he misshes
dis ting&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ten notes of a thousand dollars
each&mdash;" murmured Fitz-Cowles, locking
the trunk again&mdash;"Much good
will they do him! Devil-Bug is such
an amiable man!"</p>

<p>"Now I vill pegone!" exclaimed
Gabriel, hastily concealing the notes
within the breast of his overcoat.

<!-- page 152 col 1 -->

"Dish countries is too hot to holdt
me."</p>

<p>He strode to the door, and looked
back at Fitz-Cowles, as he uttered
this pleasant good bye.</p>

<p>"Farewells! Ven ve meetsh agin
may ve pe in betterish spiritsh&mdash;Goot
byesh!"</p>

<p>He disappeared, and in a moment
was heard passing hurriedly along the
entry, without the bedchamber.</p>

<p>"Go!" shrieked Fitz-Cowles, the
moment he had disappeared&mdash;"Go,
and to your DEATH!"</p>

<p>He paced hurriedly along the room,
his brow darkening over with a heavy
frown, and his eye blazing with excitement.</p>

<p>"Ha! The door leading into the
saloon is ajar&mdash;could anyone have
listened to our conversation?"&mdash;he
pushed the door open and glanced
around the spacious apartment as he
spoke&mdash;"Ha, ha! There is no one
in this room! What a fool I am to
fancy a listener near. And yet that
fellow, Buzby&mdash;but he's too cowardly
to betray a <i>man</i>. He might muster
courage to betray a lame nigger
woman, or a sick rag picker&mdash;but <i>a
man</i> never!"</p>

<p>He closed the door, leading into the
saloon, as he spoke.</p>

<p>And as the door was closed, the
form of a man stole softly from the
folds of the silken window curtains,
and Buzby Poodle stood disclosed in
the light. His face was very pale,
and his hands trembled like pendulums,
very much out of order.</p>

<p>"Here's a secret worth a fortune&mdash;"
he exclaimed, as he passed
through the saloon door, into the winding
entry of the fourth story&mdash;"Betray

<!-- page 152 col 2 -->

a rag picker, indeed! Ho! ho!
What if I betray a forger?"</p>

<p>Meanwhile Fitz-Cowles strode swiftly
along the floor of his bedchamber,
his face and manner, betraying the
wild excitement which possessed his
soul.</p>

<p>"If I manage my cards right I am
safe! Ha! ha! That Jew got up
some very neat letters from my father&mdash;the
Earl of Lyndeswold, Lincolnshire,
England! To give the d&mdash;l
his due, the Jew managed these letters
with a masterly hand. English post
marks and all! I showed them to
Dora, together with a parchment containing
our pedigree&mdash;the Lyndeswolds
of Lyndeswold! I have used
the Jew, and now egad! he must
<i>retire</i> from the scene! By next
Monday morning I can arrange everything!
And then, as from the decks
of a steamer bound for England, I
gaze upon the receding shores of
America, while Dora smiles in my
face, and the cash rattles in my pocket,
then&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;how I shall
laugh at these fools of the Quaker
City!"</p>

<p>CHAPTER FOURTH.</p>

<p class="small">DORA LIVINGSTONE AT HOME.</p>

</div>

<p>THE <i>boudoir</i> was lighted by two
long and narrow windows looking to
the south. The morning sunshine
shone mildly round the place, through
the folds of the thick curtains of light
silk, which hung drooping along the
windows.</p>

<p>In shape, the room was sexagonal,

<!-- page 153 col 1 -->

with pedestals of dark marble, standing
along four of the six walls. On
the top of one pedestal stood an alabaster
vase, containing flowers of the
choicest hues and fragrance, gathered
from the conservatory&mdash;which was
visible through the small door, on the
summit of the second, was placed a
statue of the Venus de Medici, sculptured
by a master hand, in snow-white
marble; the third supported another
vase, also filled with flowers, while
the top of the fourth was occupied by
an image of the Virgin Mary, her
eyes raised upward to heaven, and
her hands clasped over the crucifix,
resting upon her bosom.</p>

<p>The small door leading into the adjoining
conservatory, located in the
second story of the western wing of
Livingstone's princely mansion, hung
slightly ajar. A delightful fragrance,
the breath and sweetness of many
flowers, pervaded the atmosphere.
The perfume of the full-blown rose, the
penetrating scent of the heliotrope, the
delightful odor of the arbor vit&aelig;, mingling
with the fragrance of a thousand
other plants and flowers, created an air
of delicious and intoxicating sweetness.</p>

<p>The appointments of the <i>boudoir</i>&mdash;or,
perhaps, closet would be the more
correct designation&mdash;were neat and
classic. Four handsome gothic chairs,
with worked-cloth seats, disposed
along the walls, an elegant sofa, placed
between two of the pedestals, a severely-classic
table of snow-white
marble standing opposite, all burdened
with books in costly binding, strewn
over its surface; and a gorgeous
Turkey carpet, whose deep rich colors
were in effective contrast to the
light and delicate papering of the

<!-- page 153 col 2 -->

walls; all combined produced an effect
of elegance and taste, heightened and
refined by the vases of flowers, and the
marble statues presenting beauty in
the contrasted forms of Religion and
Love.</p>

<p>The heat of the conservatory, mingling
with the sweetness of its flowers,
imparted a fragrant warmth to the
<i>boudoir</i>. No stove, nor grate, with
glaring coal or crackling wood, was
therefore needed to render the place
comfortable.</p>

<p>Altogether the entire room was imbued
with an air of spiritual repose
of dreamy languor, which would have
been very etherial indeed, if it had not
been for the presence of the small
breakfast table which stood in the
centre of the carpet, like a plain and
stubborn earthly fact, with its silver
coffee-pot, porcelain cup, and buttered
toast, disposed along the surface of a
snow-white cloth. However, the coffee
was cold, and the toast untasted.
This was something in favor of the
spirituality of the <i>boudoir</i>.</p>

<p>Through the dim light which imparted
a twilight effect to the room,
you might discern the outlines of a
woman's form, as she lay reclining on
the sofa. Her form, full, large and
voluptuous, was enveloped in the folds
of a snow-white morning gown, which
gathering lightly around her queenly
figure, displayed the symmetry of her
rounded arms, the fulness of her bust,
and the swelling outlines of her person,
in the richest varieties of light and
shade. A single red gleam of sunlight,
escaping through the folds of
the window-curtain streamed over the
whiteness of her snowy neck.</p>

<!-- page 154 col 1 -->

<p>Her head resting on the sofa cushion,
with the dark hair falling carelessly
around, her eyes were half-closed
in dreamy reverie and the
brightness of her glance, subdued to a
hazy dimness, which attested the absence
of her thoughts from all outward
things, stole mildly from the
shadow of the long and trembling
lashes.</p>

<p>Her entire attitude was that of a
person, absorbed in some delightful
reverie. Her hands were gently clasped
in front of her form, her limbs, as
you might see by the folds of her
dress, were carelessly crossed, one
over the other, while one small and
delicate foot, with the slender ankle,
encased in the snow-white stocking,
was visible, as she lay with her voluptuous
person, thrown lightly along the
sofa.</p>

<p>She was indeed a beautiful and voluptuous
woman. The deep vermilion
of her lips, the burning flush crimsoning
each cheek, the blackness of her eyelashes
and pencilled brows, the long
dark hair which when all unbound,
fell in thick and glossy tresses, below
her waist, the fullness of her bosom,
the swelling roundness of her limbs,
the smallness of her feet, and the delicacy
of her hands, with long and tapering
fingers, all attested her loveliness
and beauty; while the swimming
glance of her large eyes, indicates
the innate voluptuousness of her
nature.</p>

<p>Her eyes, were of that deep and
well-like brightness, which seems to
throw open to the vision of the gazer,
not only their mellowed glance and
dazzling radiance, but the entire prospect
of the hidden soul. You gazed

<!-- page 154 col 2 -->

not upon, but into, those eyes, and
felt that you were in the presence of a
mighty intellect and a sensual organization.</p>

<p>As she lay reclining on the sofa, a
low murmur of delight escaped from
her lips, and a flush, like the sunny-side
of a ripening peach, brightened
over her face and neck.
Her eyelids slowly unclosing revealed
her large dark eyes, animate with an
expression of sudden delight, and
beaming with a swimming brightness
that finds no parallel, save in the
glance of a lovely and voluptuous
woman.</p>

<p>Dora rose slowly to her feet, and
stood erect upon the floor.</p>

<p>"That were a boon, worth the peril
of a soul to win!" she whispered in a
low and softened tone, as her hands
absently toyed with the rose, which
rested upon her bosom&mdash;"A coronet,
yes, yes, a coronet! This is a fair
brow they tell me&mdash;how well the glittering
circlet of diamonds, would become
its beauty! A coronet! But one
short year ago, a poor girl, clad in the
threadbare costume, which seems to
belong by right, to poverty-stricken
gentility, watched by the bedside of a
dying mother, in a meanly-furnished
apartment, faintly illumined by the
beams of a flickering lamp. <i>Now</i> that
poor girl, is the wife of one of the
merchant-princes of the city, rolls in
wealth, almost without limit, and of
course moves among the first circles
of the Aristocracy of this good city!
Such Aristocracy ha, ha! Like a specimen
of paste-board statuary, giving
a grotesque outline, of the reality
which it is intended to represent!
Another year! Ha, ha! My brain

<!-- page 155 col 1 -->

grows wild! Another year and this
same poor girl, may, no, no, <i>will</i>
stand among the glittering circles of a
royal Court, with the blaze of rank
and beauty flashing all around her,
with the smile of a Queen, beaming
upon her face, while a coronet, that
tells the ancestral glories of a thousand
years, rests brightly upon her
brow!&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'Dora Livingstone, wife of Livingstone,
the Merchant-Prince'&mdash;that
sounds well, though 'prince' that word
'merchant' as you may, it still retains&mdash;ha,
ha! a wonderful taint of
the Shop! But there is a title, written
on the very clouds which darken over
my Future, which would sound much
better, and that title&mdash;but hold my
brain grows dizzy; I seem to glide on
air&mdash;that title is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dora Lyndeswold, Countess of
Lyndeswold!" said a deep voice at the
shoulder of the beautiful woman.&mdash;</p>

<p>She turned hastily round, gazing
upon the intruder, with a glance of
mingled surprise and anger.</p>

<p>Fitz-Cowles, in all the elegance of
his fashionable attire, stood before her,
with his conical hat in one hand, his
gold-headed cane in the other, while
a smile of peculiar meaning lighted
up his dusky countenance.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! Dora, you are surprised
to see me! The truth is, old Artichoke
your gardener, attracted my eye as I
passed through the hall. He wanted
me to examine, some of his favorite
plants. While his attention was turned
another way, I stole up the back
staircase reached the conservatory,
and here I am! Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;Dora, notwithstanding
your incredulous smile,

<!-- page 155 col 2 -->

it is in your power, to be Countess of
Lyndeswold&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Algernon, it can never be&mdash;" exclaimed
Dora, fixing the gaze of her
brilliant eyes, upon his countenance,
with a glance of strange meaning.</p>

<p>"But it can be, Dora, and it must
be&mdash;" answered Fitz-Cowles, in a
careless tone, as he gently balanced
his gold-headed cane, on the palm of
his right hand, with a see-saw motion.</p>

<p>Dora silently laid her hand on his
shoulder, and gazed into his eyes, with
a glance of deep interest.</p>

<p>"By what means, you would ask?
By flight! Yes, by flight! Next Tuesday
the Great Western, sails from
New York. Let us arrange all our
matters, take passage on board the
steamer, and in fifteen days we will be
in London. It is but a day's ride from
London to Lyndeswold&mdash;"</p>

<p>" 'Lyndeswold'&mdash;" echoed Dora,
and the name seemed to act like a spell
upon her&mdash;"Ah, ha! England boasts
an Aristocracy, founded on high deeds
whose records we trace, in the history
of a thousand years. The Aristocracy
of this land, and ha, ha, this <i>city</i>, is
founded on&mdash;what? Can you tell
Algernon?"</p>

<p>"I've been trying to find out for the
last three months. I flatter myself
that I know something about the peculiar
merits and glories of Quaker
City, aristocracy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An Aristocracy founded on the
high deeds of dentists, tape-sellers,
quacks, pettifoggers, and bank directors,
all jumbled together in a ridiculous
mass of absurdities. Your dentist,
whose proper court of arms
should be a 'tooth and pincers on a

<!-- page 156 col 1 -->

field gules,' sends to the Herald's College,
in London, and asks the Heralds
to trace back his pedigree to the conquest!
And so with all the classes of
the Philadelphia <i>ton</i>. Now could we
establish a Herald's college, in the
State House, I would make the profession
of every man, the rule by
which to fashion his crest or coat of
arms! To the Quack&mdash;a pill-box!
To the pettifogger, three links of a convict's
chain, with the Penitentiary in
the distance! To the Bank Director a
Widow's Coffin, with a weeping Orphan
on either side by way of heraldic
supporters! Pah! There is no single
word of contempt in the whole
language, too bitter, to express my
opinion of this magnificent Pretension&mdash;the
Aristocracy of the Quaker
City!"</p>

<p>"You are quite animated, Dora!
I never trouble myself about such
small matters!"</p>

<p>"Do you know, what was the profession
of my grandfather?" exclaimed
Dora, as with a smile of bitter sarcasm
playing on her proud lip, she
again confronted Fitz-Cowles&mdash;"Why,
ha, ha, ha! He was&mdash;guess what?"</p>

<p>"A merchant perhaps? or a 'member
of one of the oldest families of
Pennsylvania' to use the slang of the
day, or&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>A Shoemaker!</i>" shrieked Dora,
with a burst of laughter, as she strode
hurriedly up and down the room&mdash;"Yes,
yes a shoemaker!"</p>

<p>"A cobbler!" muttered Fitz-Cowles
starting with a look of silent disgust.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, a toil-begrim'd cobbler,
who sate working all day long on an
old bench, mending other peoples' old
shoes? And I ashamed of this? Ha,

<!-- page 156 col 2 -->

ha! Not in the least! The cobbler's
grand-daughter moves in the first circles
of the Aristocracy of Philadelphia!
And what is something to her
credit, she is not ashamed of her ancestry!
She does not conceal it with
some sounding pretension to high birth,
but at once, and without reserve, horrifies,
the tape-and-bobbin nobility of
the Quaker City, with the plain declaration,
that Dora Livingstone wife of
the Merchant Prince, is a Cobbler's
grand-daughter!"</p>

<p>"Deuce take me, if I can understand
you Dora! You are not ashamed
of having a shoemaker for your grandfather,
and yet you reverence the spirit
of ancestral pride!"</p>

<p>"You have given my opinions with
remarkable precision! I tell you, Algernon,
that I respect, the Mechanic,
at his bench, though his hands be
rough, his face begrimed with toil,
his manners uncouth and destitute of
polish! But for the petty Aristocrat;
the Duke Thimble-and-thread, the
Count Soap-and-candle, the Baron
Peddle-and-cheat, for all these, I <i>do</i>
entertain the most sovereign contempt!
Give me the honest Mechanic at the
bench if we must have a nobility, for
your true republican nobleman: not
the dishonest Bank-Director at the
desk! But if you pass the Mechanic
aside&mdash;whose honest vote, sustains
your republic&mdash;if you pass him aside,
when you form your Aristocracy, then
I say, give us the Titles and the Trappings
of an English nobility! Let us
at once have a Throne and a Count,
a King and Courtiers!"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! Dora&mdash;you grow
philosophical! Decidedly so! But you
have quite forgotten my proposition.

<!-- page 157 col 1 -->

Flight, Dora, sudden and successful
flight!"</p>

<p>"And do you think Fitz-Cowles,
that I would fly with you as an&mdash;it is
a sweet word and a true one&mdash;as an
Adultress! As an Adultress forsaking
her husband? No&mdash;No! By my
life; no!"</p>

<p>"Once in England, we could be
united in marriage, without the slightest
difficulty. You would become the
Countess of Lyndeswold on the death
of my father, when I would succeed
to the Earldom. During his life, our
title would merely be, my Lord and
Lady Dalveny of Lyndeswold&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Countess of Lyndeswold, and my
husband living in America! Ha, ha,
ha! This is like some probable history
in the Arabian Nights!"</p>

<p>"And how do you propose to overcome
the&mdash;the <i>difficulty</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which is but another name for
a&mdash;husband, after all&mdash;" muttered
Dora in a tone, inaudible to Fitz-Cowles.</p>

<p>"You know, Dora, that we must
arrange our plan of action without delay.
A solitary word of suspicion,
whispered in your husband's ears by
some officious friend, and our schemes
are blown to the&mdash;gentleman in
black."</p>

<p>Dora approached Fitz-Cowles and
laid her hand on his shoulder, while
her dark eyes, flashing with a deep
and meaning glance, were fixed upon
his countenance.</p>

<p>"Suppose Livingstone should <i>die</i>&mdash;"
she said, in a low whisper, while her
eyes became intensely brilliant and
her face grew suddenly pale.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;" replied Fitz-Cowles, with
a slight start&mdash;"Why, you would then
be the widow Livingstone, with a fortune

<!-- page 157 col 2 -->

of some two hundred thousand in
your possession. But you know, Dora,
Livingstone bids fair to live at least
half a century from the present moment&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Livingstone may die, and that
suddenly</i>&mdash;" said Dora, in that same
low tone, while the hand, resting on
Fitz-Cowles shoulder, trembled like a
leaf.</p>

<p>"Egad! Dora, you're white as
snow in the face! One would think
you meant&mdash;<i>something</i>&mdash;by the
glance of your eyes. Do speak out
and let us hear the news&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen, Algernon, and I will tell
you a secret. Strong and vigorous
man as he looks, Livingstone has been
for years the victim of a secret and
insidious disease. It is that disease
which slowly and quietly, almost without
pain, ossifies the main arteries of
the heart. The victim may live for
years, with the flush of health on his
cheek and brow, while this insidious
disease is closing up the avenues of
his life. He may live for years with
all the outward signs of health and
vigor, when a sudden excitement of
mind would lay him down a lifeless
corse; aye, in an instant, without a
single pain to warn him of his danger,
he would fall a lifeless corse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I remember. McTorniquet&mdash;the
queer doctor, who talks
of Henry Clay, the statesman, and
Henry Clay, his blood horse, all in
the same breath&mdash;took the trouble,
one day last week, to explain this
disease to me. However, he did not
tell me that Livingstone was its victim&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This doctor, who is our family
physician, called here but an hour

<!-- page 158 col 1 -->

ago, and asked me when I expected
Mr. Livingstone back from New York.
I answered, of course, next week. He
then told me that the main arteries of
<i>my husband's</i> heart were now almost
entirely ossified; that I must take
every care in the world of him, for
any sudden excitement, <i>would kill
him in an instant</i>&mdash;"*</p>

<p class="small">[*In the course of a series of lectures, delivered
last winter by the gifted Dr. Mitchell,
celebrated no less for his medical attainments
than his poetical genius, the learned gentleman
described the disease of the heart in detail.
From his lecture I derived a knowledge
of the various phenomena of the disease,
which I have used in this portion of my narrative.
The learned Doctor described, in
eloquent terms, the insidious manner in which
this disease, through a long course of years,
gradually ossified the avenues to the heart of
its victim, until at last, his life would hang
suspended by a hair. The victim might live
for years&mdash;if I do not mis-quote the Doctor&mdash;with
the main arteries of the heart most entirely
ossified, but a sudden and violent excitement
would result in instantaneous death. Since
the lectures of the Doctor, I have seen the
truth of his remarks confirmed, in the death
of a man, whose cheeks were glowing with
apparent health at the very moment when he
fell a lifeless corse.]</p>

<p>"What a pity! Poor fellow! To
think of a man going about with such
a <i>bad heart</i> in his bosom!"</p>

<p>"You understand me, then? Livingstone
may live for twenty, nay, for
thirty years longer, and he may die
in a year, a month, a day, or&mdash;it
may be&mdash;in an hour."</p>

<p>"I appreciate his position, Dora.
To say the least, it's a very ticklish
one. Jove! The idea of a man having
red cheeks, bright eyes, and a
firm step, while his heart is turning to
bone&mdash;the idea of such a state of affairs,
I say!"</p>

<p>Dora drew nearer to Algernon's

<!-- page 158 col 2 -->

side, and suddenly grasped him by
the wrist. There was a wild light
gleaming from her dark eyes as she
gazed fixedly in his face, and a slight
wrinkle indented the surface of her fair
forehead, between the eyebrows. Her
voice was utterly changed in its tones,
when she whispered these words to the
listener's ear.</p>

<p>"Algernon, give me your advice on
a point of the deepest interest. When
my husband returns from New York,
I will seize the earliest opportunity to
press upon his attention the importance
of having his Will prepared without
delay. Poor man! His life hangs
by a slender thread&mdash;the most trifling
chance may sever that thread, and
precipitate him into eternity. It is
important, therefore, that he should
hold himself prepared for death. Justice
to his wife demands that his Will,
making a final disposition of his fortune,
should be executed with all possible
haste&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By Jove, Dora, you look quite
wild. To what tends all this? Hush!
Did you not hear a footstep in the
conservatory?"</p>

<p>"Suppose, Algernon, that my husband
should make his Will. Suppose
he leaves his fortune to his wife.
These suppositions made, I wish you
to imagine a scene. Livingstone and
myself are seated in the parlor, on a
winter's evening, beside the cheerful
fire. His face is lighted up with a
pleasant smile, as, displaying the unfolded
Will in his hands, he gazes
upon the beaming countenance of his
wife. And that wife&mdash;mark you,
Algernon&mdash;at the very moment when
the husband reaches forth his arms to
clasp her to his bosom, falls on her

<!-- page 159 col 1 -->

knees at his feet, and, in broken words,
shrieks forth the story of her guilt, and
his dishonor! Yes, yes, to his ear,
to the ear of the man who loves his
wife as man never loved wife before,
that young and <i>innocent</i> wife, tells the
dark story of her shame! Even
while his face beams with affection,
she tells him that he is <i>dishonored</i>,
aye, <i>dishonored!</i> That she has been
false to his bed, recreant to her plighted
faith! That she is polluted in person,
corrupt in soul! That this young
wife, whom he loved so well, is&mdash;ha,
ha&mdash;an <i>Adultress!</i> This she tells
him with tears of repentance, with
prayers for mercy, with groans of
anguish! And <i>he</i>&mdash;how think ye
Livingstone would hear this confession
from the wife whose very image he
now worships? Ha! Algernon!
Think ye not, it would kill him, even
before his <i>frantic</i> wife had done with
her tale of guilt? Even as he sate,
without a moment's delay, he would
fall from his chair, a stiffened corse?
Would he not, Algernon?"</p>

<p>A blasphemous oath escaped from
Fitz-Cowles' lips, and in a sudden
start, which shook his frame, he suffered
his hat and cane to fall on the
floor.</p>

<p>By G&mdash;d, Dora, I don't think
you're a human being!"</p>

<p>He said this in a low-toned voice,
and turned away from the Merchant's
wife, as she stood in the centre of the
room, her stature dilating to its full
height, while, with a panting bosom
and a flashing eye, she awaited his
answer to her momentous question.</p>

<p>"And <i>this</i>," she cried, gazing upon
Fitz-Cowles, who stood near the window
with his face averted from her

<!-- page 159 col 2 -->

glance&mdash;"And this, after I have sacrificed
all I possess on earth, all I hope
in heaven; and sacrificed for <i>you!</i>"</p>

<p>"Hush! Didn't you hear a footstep
in the conservatory? Really,
Dora, you are very imprudent&mdash;" exclaimed
Fitz-Cowles, in a sullen tone,
as he gazed vacantly through the window-curtains.</p>

<p>"Would to God, there had been a
footstep in the conservatory when I
first resigned myself to shame!" said
Dora, in a tone of keen and biting
sarcasm.</p>

<p>"When a lady agrees, makes up
her mind to part with her virtue, and
a gentleman makes up his mind to
accept the gift, all is fair and satisfactory,
and nobody, but an injured husband
has a right to complain. But,
Murder, Dora&mdash;<i>Murder</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Murder! Madman that you are,
who spoke of murder? Fitz-Cowles,
I beseech you do not force me to
change my opinion, with regard, to
you. I thought you were a man; one
of that class, in fact, who look rather
to the end that is to be accomplished
than to the delicacy of the means&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But Dora, this <i>experiment</i> of
yours has ten chances of failure, to
one of success. Livingstone might
recover from the shock, occasioned by
your confession&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then it is the chance of failure,
not the experiment itself, which turns
your face to the hue of ashes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n the thing, Dora, Livingstone
never wronged me. And I can't see
that he has done you any injury sufficient
to warrant such a return&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I perceive Algernon&mdash;" said Dora,
crossing her arms, with a calm gesture&mdash;"You
 do not understand me.

<!-- page 160 col 1 -->

Livingstone, never did me a wrong:
on the contrary, he has bestowed
wealth upon me, almost without bound,
and lavished affection upon me, until
it amounts to idolatry. You never
gave me wealth, you never gave me
love. Then what is the tie that binds
me to you? You have it in your
power to grace the&mdash;the&mdash;ha, ha!
The Cobbler's grand-daughter with a
<i>title!</i> Livingstone is the 'bar sinister,'
ha, ha, between me and hereditary
rank! Who spoke of murder? Not
I, by my life! Livingstone may die,
he <i>may</i> die. That, was all I said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He <i>may</i> die, that is true&mdash;" said
Fitz-Cowles, turning away from the
window&mdash;"By-the-bye, Dora, you are
remarkably ambitious, for a sensible
woman. Your very soul, seems absorbed
in this ambition to rise&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is a leaf of my heart, Fitz-Cowles,
which you never yet, have
read. I loved once; loved with all
the intensity of my nature, and sacrificed
my plighted love, for wealth and
Livingstone. Did you never read in
books, that the first love of a strong-minded
woman, when divested from its
proper source, turns to the gall and
bitterness of worldly ambition? I feel
in my inmost soul, that I was destined
from my birth to rank and station, to
the sway of hearts and the rule of
power.&mdash;In my early childhood, when
forced by penury, my mother, a widowed
and a friendless woman, sought
a home, in the outskirts of the city,
the prophecy was whispered in my
ears, that one day, I should wear a coronet,
and walk a titled lady among
the grandees of a royal court&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And some old crone, I suppose,

<!-- page 160 col 2 -->

with a cup sprinkled with tea-grounds
in her hand, was the Oracle?"</p>

<p>"It matters not, for the prophecy,
come it from whom it might, found its
echo in my own heart. Does it not
often chance, that a casual word, uttered
by an ignorant mechanic, strikes
a mighty chord in some Statesman's
heart, and originates a new and magnificent
scheme of state policy? So a
chance word, from vulgar lips, may
arouse a prophecy which has been
hidden in our souls, since the hour of
our birth. Why did the Creole, Josephine,
credit the withered hag, who foretold
that her brow, would one day be encircled
with the Crown of France?
Because the old crone, was gifted by
heaven with especial power? No&mdash;no&mdash;no!
She might have foretold a
thousand incidents, and not one would
have impressed the heart of Josephine,
with even a passing sensation.</p>

<p>"On the heart of this same Creole,
Josephine, from the hour of her birth,
had been written down by God's own
hand, the high destiny for which she
had been born, and the chance words
of the old crone, aroused the prophecy
into life!"</p>

<p>"Hush! Dora, there is a footstep
on the stairs&mdash;" exclaimed Fitz-Cowles
with a sudden start.</p>

<p>"My God! It is Livingstone's footstep!"
and as she spoke, Dora's face
grew suddenly pale&mdash;"Ha! The note,
which I left last night on the centre
table, was gone, when I looked for it
this morning. Could he have returned
in the night?"</p>

<p>The door leading into the main building
 of the mansion, was suddenly
opened, and a red-faced servant in

<!-- page 161 col 1 -->

grey livery, turned up with velvet,
entered the <i>boudoir</i>.</p>

<p>"Mister Livingstone, ma'am!"</p>

<p>And in an instant Livingstone appeared
in the doorway, and entered
the room.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;ha! My dear&mdash;I've stole a
march on you, have I? Back from
New York sooner than I expected,
you see! Ah&mdash;ha! Colonel, is that
you? How <i>do</i> you do!"</p>

<p>"My God! Livingstone! How pale
you are!" was the involuntary exclamation
of the wife, as her eyes, were
rivetted to his countenance&mdash;"Have
you been ill?"</p>

<p>"Egad! You look as if you been
sick a-month!" exclaimed Fitz-Cowles&mdash;"Why
Livingstone positively you're
turning grey!"</p>

<p>Calm and smiling Livingstone advanced,
and gathered his right arm
round the waist of his beautiful wife.
His face was very pale, and his blue
eyes, had an unnatural brilliancy in
their glance, which in the mind of an
acute observer might have aroused a
suspicion as to the sanity of the Merchant.</p>

<p>"One kiss my love!" exclaimed
Livingstone, as he pressed his lips to
the full and pouting lips of his wife,
while his face, brightened with a look
of pleasure&mdash;"You must excuse,
these little matrimonial attentions Fitz-Cowles.
We married men, are very
apt to be fond of our wives; especially
after a long absence. And how's
your poor sick friend my dear!"</p>

<p>"You have my note, then?" exclaimed
Dora, as a slight tremor was
visible on her lip.</p>

<p>"To be sure, my dear, to be sure.
I returned from New York in the night,

<!-- page 161 col 2 -->

found your note on the centre-table,
and having read its contents, I retired
from the house without alarming the
servants. I spent the night at the
counting-house, examining my books
and papers. How did you say your
poor sick friend was, Dora?"</p>

<p>"Alas! She is&mdash;dead!" and Dora
turned away as if to conceal her agitation.</p>

<p>"Well, well, it can't be helped.
'Debt we've all got to pay'&mdash;as the
old women at a funeral, have it. By-the-bye,
Fitz-Cowles, I've got some
traces of the Forger at last!"</p>

<p>The Merchant laid his hand playfully
on Fitz-Cowles' shoulder and
gazed smilingly in his eyes, while his
unoccupied hand, toyed with his watch-seals,
in a careless manner.</p>

<p>"The deuce, you have?" answered
Fitz-Cowles with a stare of surprise&mdash;"By
Jove!" he muttered to himself&mdash;"There
is a strange look, about Livingstone's
eyes, that doesn't exactly
please me!"</p>

<p>"I tell you how it was, my boy&mdash;"
continued Livingstone, still toying
with his watch-seals&mdash;"While I was
in New York, the head clerk of the
Charleston House, arrived in town. He
recognized the Forger, one day in
Broadway, strutting it, among the
finest bucks of the city&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you arrested him?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. We had evidence
enough for suspicion; but 'conviction'
you know is a different thing. You'll
laugh when I tell you how I managed
it with the fellow. He was one of my
most intimate friends in New York;
and was wont to frequent my rooms,
very much during the day, manifesting
his familiarity by calling me 'a

<!-- page 162 col 1 -->

jolly old fellow'&mdash;'Old Lin.' and all
that kind of thing, you understand?
Before the head clerk arrived from the
South, I did not ever dream of suspecting
this perfumed gentleman of
the forgery. Why Colonel do you
know, that I'd just as soon suspected
you, as him?"</p>

<p>"Curse me Livingstone these kind
of comparisons, are deuced unpleasant&mdash;"
observed Fitz-Cowles growing
very uneasy under the Merchant's
gaze.</p>

<p>"What do you think we did when
we found that we hadn't evidence
sufficient for conviction? Why&mdash;ha,
ha! It's too good! We dressed up
a decayed police officer, like a Southern
planter, and introduced him to
the Forger, as a gentleman of immense
fortune from the South. The forger,
promenades New York, with the disguised
Police Officer at his elbow,
showing the pseudo-planter all the
'lions' of the town, and making himself
agreeable in a general way. Now
the joke of the thing."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;" echoed Fitz-Cowles&mdash;"The
joke of the thing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is simply this. The 'Southern
Planter' has a warrant in his pocket,
for the arrest of the Forger, the moment
he shall attempt to leave the City!
Ha&mdash;Ha Ha! Capital!"</p>

<p>"Capital! Capital! Ha, ha, ha!"
roared Fitz-Cowles.</p>

<p>"Isn't it too good?"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! It <i>is</i> too good! A
warrant in his pocket, for the arrest
of the Forger, all the while&mdash;did ye
say! Capital&mdash;ha, ha, ha! Capital!"</p>

<p>"Why Fitz-Cowles, your ladye-love,
has been making free with a lock
of your hair!" exclaimed Livingstone

<!-- page 162 col 2 -->

playfully&mdash;"Look here, Dora, what
space there is, near Fitz-Cowles' right
temple! A large lock severed close to
the skin&mdash;why Dora, I declare you
too, have been making somebody a
present of a lock of your hair! A
large tress severed from the hair, near
your right temple too! Singular coincidence&mdash;oh,
Fitz-Cowles?"</p>

<p>With the same involuntary gesture,
Fitz-Cowles and Dora, both raised
their hands to their right temples, and
both discovered that a large tress was
missing, from among the clustering
locks of their raven-black hair.</p>

<p>"Curse that barber! I shall have to
flog him!" muttered Fitz-Cowles&mdash;"How
deuced careless in him!"</p>

<p>"Positively Albert, I can't tell how
this occurred&mdash;" said Dora approaching
her husband&mdash;"I must have cut
it off in my sleep. How extremely
odd&mdash;" "Or somebody may have cut
it off, to save you the trouble, while
you were asleep!" said Livingstone
with a kindly smile, as turning from
his wife he approached one of the
windows, and looked out upon the sky.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dora stood silent and
thoughtful, her bosom heaving upward
with sudden pulsations, clashed for a
moment, convulsively together, trembled
with the agitation that quivered
through her whole frame.</p>

<p>"<i>Now</i>" she murmured as a slight
pallor overspread her beautiful countenance&mdash;"<i>Now</i>,
is the moment of
my fate! The disease, gathering round
his heart, manifests its progress already,
in his countenance! I will confess
all, ha, ha, I will throw myself at
his feet and beseech his pardon!"</p>

<p>Fitz-Cowles turned pale as ashes.
He did not hear the whispered words

<!-- page 163 col 1 -->

of Dora, but he read her fixed and desperate
purpose in the lines of her countenance,
now moulded into an expression,
as unrelenting as Death. While
his brain whirled round in wild confusion,
he resolved to delay or at least
to thwart the accomplishment of her
purpose.</p>

<p>"Aid me now, Great Father, before
whom, I shall so soon appear!" were
the murmured words that broke from
the white lips of Livingstone, as with
his face turned from his wife and her
paramour, he made a pretence of
gazing upon the clear and blue winter's
sky&mdash;"I feel that fit of madness coming
over me again. Oh, for a little
strength to go through the mockery!
To pretend affection to the wife; friendship
to the paramour! There is frenzy
in my veins; I know it; I feel it; but
I will, I will command my soul!"</p>

<p>And yet as the words escaped from
his lips, he felt that same feeling of
mocking frenzy, which had given its
impulse to his actions, in Monk-Hall,
the night before, rushing like a torrent
through his veins. Conscious that he
was acting like a madman, he drew a
pistol from his bosom, and making one
stride across the floor, held it to the
heart of Fitz-Cowles.</p>

<p>"A handsome pistol Colonel! Silver
mounted with a hair trigger! One
touch of my finger and you're a dead
man! Ha&mdash;ha! How you step backward,
how you recede to the wall.
Zounds, man, but I believe you're
afraid!"</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, Livingstone,
put the thing away&mdash;" cried Fitz-Cowles
as with the pistol at his heart,
step by step he retreated to the wall&mdash;"You
might, you know, pull the trigger

<!-- page 163 col 2 -->

by chance! It's loaded you say
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The ball might lodge in your
heart! Ha! ha! ha! So it might!
Suppose we try!"</p>

<p>As he spoke he pulled the trigger.
Dora uttered an involuntary shriek as
the 'clinking' of the pistol broke on the
air, and then covered her face with
her hands. When she again looked
around the room, she beheld Fitz-Cowles
standing in one corner, pale
as ashes, while Livingstone, with a
bitter smile wreathing his white lips,
still held the pistol presented at his
breast.</p>

<p>"Confound those 'caps'&mdash;not worth
the having!" exclaimed Livingstone,
with a pleasant smile&mdash;"Why, Colonel,
ha, ha, ha! You look as frightened
as if, ha, ha, ha! I had intended to
shoot you!"</p>

<p>"The pistol was loaded&mdash;" hesitated
Fitz-Cowles, as he averted his
eyes from Livingstone's flashing
glance.</p>

<p>"Loaded? Nonsense man&mdash;I was
merely trying some new percussion
caps."</p>

<p>"The disease has affected his reason&mdash;"
muttered Dora, as she advanced
to her husband's side&mdash;"Now
for the confession and the&mdash;<i>result!</i>"</p>

<p>"You dropped your handkerchief,
Mrs. Livingstone&mdash;" exclaimed Fitz-Cowles,
as starting hastily forward
he presented the snow-white "<i>mouchoir</i>,"
with a low bow&mdash;"<i>Not on the
peril of your soul!</i>" he hissed the
whisper between his set teeth, as his
dark eyes were fixed upon her face,
with a malignant yet frightened glance.</p>

<p>She returned his glance with a look
of scorn.</p>

<!-- page 164 col 1 -->

<p>She advanced to her husband's side,
she seized his arm with a convulsive
grasp, while her dark eyes flashed with
an expression of the deepest emotion.</p>

<p>"Livingstone&mdash;" she shrieked,
with all the pathos of voice and gesture
at her control&mdash;"I have much
to tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>In another instant she lay panting
upon his breast, with her arms flung
round his neck, while the convulsive
sobs, which heaved her bosom, broke
wildly on her husband's ear.</p>

<p>Fitz-Cowles saw that his fate hung
in a balance, which the weight of a
feather might turn.</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried Livingstone, with the
same strange glance which marked his
wandering intellect, flashing from his
clear blue eye&mdash;"Ha! what means
this agitation&mdash;this sudden emotion&mdash;these
sobs and tears?"</p>

<p>"Why the fact is, Livingstone&mdash;your
wife is anxious&mdash;that is to say&mdash;deuce
take the thing! Dr. McTorniquet
was here this morning, and&mdash;and&mdash;dropped
some strange hints
about a disease to which you are subject&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;your
wife is alarmed
for your health&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fools! They think to deceive
me!" thought Livingstone, as his wife
lay sobbing in his arms&mdash;"They do
not dream that I overheard their ingenious
plans, as I stood in the conservatory,
not five minutes past! Ha,
ha! I will be even with them! Oh,
with regard to the disease of the
heart&mdash;" he continued, aloud&mdash;"Which
has threatened me for so
many years, I forgot to mention a
slight circumstance&mdash;McTorniquet,
this morning assured me that he
had long mistaken my symptoms.

<!-- page 164 col 2 -->

I am no more in danger, from any
malady of this kind than you are, my
dear. There, Dora, don't weep&mdash;I
can well appreciate this affectionate
regard for my health, but you mus'n't
weep&mdash;"</p>

<p>As Dora lay with her head buried
in his bosom, a quick and sudden
tremor shook her frame from head to
foot. She was deceived for once in
her life, and after having betrayed her
husband&mdash;in the very hour of his madness&mdash;became
his willing dupe. With
one start she raised her head, and her
face, pale and ghastly, from the effect
of the sudden revulsion of feeling, was
disclosed in the morning sunlight.</p>

<p>"Oh Livingstone&mdash;" she said in a
voice tremulous with emotion,&mdash;"I
am so glad to discover that all my apprehensions,
are groundless!"</p>

<p>She walked to the window, as if to
hide the agitation, the joyful agitation
which Livingstone's unexpected disclosure,
had aroused in her soul. As
she passed Fitz-Cowles, she darted a
look in his face, full of dark and fearful
meaning. For a moment her countenance
was convulsed by an expression,
hideous as it was resolute, and
then, like a sunbeam gleaming from a
cloud, all was calm and smiling again.</p>

<p>"By-the-bye, Dora, I had nearly
forgotten, an important circumstance,
connected with our celebration of the
Christmas holidays. You know, my
country seat of Hawkewood in Jersey,
some * * * * * * miles from Camden?
It is the old family mansion of the
Livingstone's&mdash;was built in fact long
before the revolution. Full of secret
passages, solemn old rooms with wide
fire-places, lofty halls, and wainscotting
without limit&mdash;you know?"</p>

<!-- page 165 col 1 -->

<p>"I have often heard of this strange
old family seat&mdash;" replied Dora, without
turning from the window, "And
have as often felt a desire to see the
place&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You shall see it, my dear, within
two days. I have this morning despatched
servants to the place, in order
to arrange the old hall for the celebration
of Christmas in the old English
style. To-morrow morning we will
start for Hawkewood and spend the
holidays there. Fitz-Cowles, I hope
you will favor us with your company?
You nod assent. Well, that is settled;
and now I must away to the warehouse.
You will excuse me, Fitz-Cowles?
I'll be home to dinner my
dear&mdash;"</p>

<p>Livingstone left the <i>boudoir</i> as he
spoke.</p>

<p>Dora turned from the window and
faced Fitz-Cowles. Their eyes met
in one deep and meaning glance.</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;" said Fitz-Cowles drawing
a long breath&mdash;"We're out of
that d&mdash;d scrape, anyhow!"</p>

<p>Dora smiled, but did not speak.
Her attention was attracted by a loose
slip of letter paper, which lay on the
carpet, near her feet. With a manner
of easy <i>nonchalance</i>, she picked this
paper from the floor, and examined it
with a careless glance.</p>

<p>In a moment, quick as a lightning
flash, her dark eyes shone with sudden
fire, her stature dilated to its full height,
and her bosom, rose and fell, beneath
the folds of her morning gown, with
an impulse of the deepest agitation.
She stood in the centre of the room, in
all her beauty and loveliness, regarding
the paper which she held in her
trembling hand, with one intense and

<!-- page 165 col 2 -->

flashing glance, while her face, was
crimsoned over by a sudden flush of
excitement. There was an expression
of scorn mingled with triumph on her
curving lip; and her high forehead,
was impressed with a slight yet meaning
frown.</p>

<p>"Why Dora&mdash;you are agitated&mdash;"
exclaimed Fitz-Cowles advancing&mdash;"What
can there be, in that slip of
paper to move you thus?"</p>

<p>Her eyes gleamed like flame-coals
as the answer broke from her lips in
a slow and deliberate whisper, rendered
most wild and thrilling, by the
sudden huskiness of her voice:</p>

<p>"Leave that to me, and to <i>the
Future!</i>"</p>

<p>CHAPTER FIFTH.</p>

<p class="small">THE GOLD WATCH.</p>

</div>

<p>"LUKE, you know how liable we
are to accident and sudden death? If
I should die suddenly, I wish you to
open this packet and execute the commission
which it names. Consider
this request, Luke, as the last request
of a dying man. Will you promise
me?"</p>

<p>"I will, and do promise you&mdash;"
Luke replied, grasping the hand of
Livingstone&mdash;"As soon as you are
dead, I will open this packet, and at
every peril, at all hazards execute the
commission which it names. Egad!"
he muttered to himself&mdash;"he seems
to have recovered from his mad fit!
A precious tramp I've had, up and
down this beautiful city ever since daybreak,
in order to cool him off!"</p>

<!-- page 166 col 1 -->

<p>"Now, Luke, I must go home to
my family," said Livingstone, with a
faint smile as they emerged from the
Exchange&mdash;"Here we part, Luke, at
least for a little while. It is now nine
o'clock. At noon, I will meet you at
my house on especial business. Good
morning!"</p>

<p>They parted. Livingstone pursued
his way up Walnut Street, while Luke
Harvey remained standing at the corner
of Walnut and Third.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose anything <i>peculiar</i>
will take place between this and sundown&mdash;do
I? Very likely I don't.
Possibly I do! Well, well, let matters
take their course. When a woman
adorns her husband's forehead
with horns she ought to remember
that these ornamental <i>branches</i> may
be turned into dangerous weapons!
Stags <i>gore</i> people sometimes! W-h-ew!
There's that tooth again! I must to
some tooth-butcher, right off!"</p>

<p>With great deliberation, Luke took
his black silk cravat from around his
neck, and investing his mouth and
jaws with its folds, fastened it over the
top of his head, with an ornamental
knot. He presented rather a singular
picture. His long and slim figure
was enveloped in a tight overcoat,
his hat was drawn down over his
brows, while his face was nearly
concealed by the folds of the black
cravat, which left a glimpse of his
eyes, the top of his nose, and a small
portion of each cheek exposed to view.</p>

<p>"I'll swear that tooth of mine must
have joined a Fire Company, by the
way it goes on! W-h-ew!"</p>

<p>Passing the various good citizens
who were pursuing their way along
Walnut Street, Luke, after a-half-an-hour's

<!-- page 166 col 2 -->

brisk walking, with his hand
pressed against his jaw all the while,
arrived before a splendid mansion,
with a great big silver plate affixed to
the door. "PILPETTE&mdash;SURGEON
DENTIST," was blazoned on the plate,
in immense letters. Luke rung the
bell, and was swearing quietly at his
tooth, when a liveried servant appeared
and showed him into a large room,
furnished in a style of lavish and auction-store
splendor, where Mr. Auguste
Pilpette, stood surrounded by the materials
of his elegant profession.</p>

<p>Mr. Auguste Pilpette was a stout
little man, with a high forehead and a
nose which would have been Roman
if it hadn't been shaped like a pear.
Mr. Pilpette prided himself on his
resemblance to Louis Phillipe, and
his acquaintance with the literature of
the day. Mr. Pilpette had been a
bricklayer the year before, and his
name had been Jonas Pulp, which by
the same lively exertion of imagination
that transformed the layer of
bricks into the puller of teeth, had
been changed into Auguste Pilpette.</p>

<p>"Pilpette, this tooth's a-goin' on as
tho' it would break my jaw, and blow
my brains out! Pull it!"</p>

<p>"We will soon arrange this little
matter&mdash;" said Auguste Pilpette, seating
Mr. Harvey in a chair, which
looked as though it had been made for
an Alderman, in the days when Aldermen
averaged three hundred pounds
a-piece&mdash;"We'll soon arrange this
little matter. A bad tooth. Shocking.
What's your opinion of Bulwer?"</p>

<p>"Bulwer be d&mdash;d! Pulp, pull my
tooth!"</p>

<p>'Pulp' did not please Mr. Auguste

<!-- page 167 col 1 -->

Pilpette. On the contrary, Mr. Pilpette
was chafed.</p>

<p>"Pulp, indeed!" he muttered&mdash;"I'll
give him a wrench for that!"</p>

<p>And, accordingly, throwing Luke's
head so far back that his upturned
eyes commanded a view of the vane
surmounting a distant steeple, which
was visible through the lofty window,
Mr. Pilpette proceeded to give Mr.
Harvey a wrench.</p>

<p>It was decidedly a wrench. Luke
sprang from the chair with a tremendous
bound and an oath.</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n&mdash;n!" he muttered or hissed,
(and the man who objects to the oath
never had the toothache.) "D&mdash;n&mdash;n!
Why Pulp, you were born two centuries
too late! The Inquisition ought
to have had you!"</p>

<p>"Don't you think Dickens excels
in the quiet touches?" said Mr. Pilpette,
with great suavity, as Luke
performed an irregular Polka over the
room&mdash;"It seems to me, there's a
feeling and a finish in Dickens."</p>

<p>"Pulp you are an ass&mdash;" replied
Luke, rather harshly, as well-nigh
convulsed with the pain of his 'unworthy
member,' the half-drawn tooth,
he dashed into Mr. Pilpette's window
curtains, and looked out upon the
street&mdash;"It's my opinion, Pulp, that
in you the Inquisition would have experienced
a great acquisition. Hollo,
who's that!"</p>

<p>Pulp, Pilpette, Inquisition, toothache,
and all were forgotten as Luke gazed
out in the street, with a stare of vacant
wonder lengthening his visage.</p>

<p>"I'll soothe him by a criticism&mdash;"
thought Pilpette&mdash;"Do you think, Mr.
Harvey, that the beauties of Shelly
are appreciated by the mass?"</p>

<!-- page 167 col 2 -->

<p>"What!" shouted Luke, gazing
into the street&mdash;"In the street at broad
daylight! I'd swear it's him! Ha!
Ellis Mortimer! He turns the corner!
Now or never!"</p>

<p>While Mr. Pilpette stood stricken
dumb with astonishment, Luke flung
up the window-sash and sprang out
upon the pavement, before Mr. Pilpette
could say 'Jonas Pulp.' Rising from
the pavement, for he had fallen in the
spring, Luke rushed down Walnut
Street at the top of his speed, while
his long black hair, and the flaps of
his overcoat streamed carelessly in
the wind.</p>

<p>The spectacle of a hatless man
traversing Walnut Street at the top of
his speed, in a cold winter's day, had
rather a maniac wildness in it, and accordingly,
two ladies with sharp faces
and blue nose-tips, stopped somewhat
suddenly in their course and gazed
after the retreating form of Luke. A
very ragged newsboy, with whom the
sharp-nosed ladies, have just been endeavoring
to trade two pious tracts
headed "<i>Bad Children in Hell</i>," for
one "extrey Ledgey" containing accounts
of a steamboat accident on the
Mississippi, also turned round and
looked after Luke, with an emphatic
adjuration to his whiskers.</p>

<p>"Oh! You bad youth!" said the
sharpest of the sharp-faced tract distributors&mdash;"Don't
you know where
little boys that say bad words will go
to?"</p>

<p>"Can't say I do. House o' Refuge
m'am?"</p>

<p>"Oh! You ignorant and deplorably-neglected
youth!" said the other lady,
whose nose was tipped with the faintest
shade of blue&mdash;"Give me that Extra

<!-- page 168 col 1 -->

Ledger and I'll give you this tract,
which tells you all about the bad
place."</p>

<p>"I'd rather not. A-cause ven the
bad place comes it comes, and vots
the use of a feller riling his system
with it aforehand?"</p>

<p>With these words the unrepentant
youth strode away, making the air
vocal with "Extrey Ledgey&mdash;steamboat
blowed up on Massesappy! Ten
hunder' lives lost&mdash;all for two cents!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, dashing along Walnut
Street, Luke Harvey pursued the distant
form of a little hump-backed man,
who, all unconscious of the danger at
his back, was quietly wending his onward
way. It was not long, however,
before he became cognizant of his
pursuer. While Luke was half-a-square
distant, he suddenly slipped
into an alley and was lost to view.
Luke turned into the alley, emerged
into an adjoining street, but no signs
could he discern of Mr. Ellis Mortimer.</p>

<p>"I would have sworn it was the
Jew!" he muttered, gazing hurriedly
up and down the street "The very
look and dress of the man!"</p>

<p>"Here's a remarkable state of affairs!
One of the first merchants in
town 'digging' along Walnut Street on
a cold winter's day, without his hat!
Ha, ha! Quite <i>unique</i> in the way of
<i>le grand spectacle</i>&mdash;as we say in domestic
French! Eh, Harvey?"</p>

<p>"Harvey!" echoed Luke, turning
round to greet the new-comer&mdash;"Why,
damme, it's Poodle, Poodle of the
Black Mail. Go 'way&mdash;fellow! I
hav'n't got any <i>bribe</i> for you!"</p>

<p>"He, he, he, how jocular!" replied
Buzby Poodle, rubbing his hands
pleasantly together&mdash;"I know what

<!-- page 168 col 2 -->

you're after. <i>The Jew</i>&mdash;ha, ha, ha&mdash;I've
been watching him. Yonder
he goes! Harvey&mdash;I say I might tell
you something if I liked! I might!
I've been watching the <i>Jew!</i>"</p>

<p>"Pooh! The Jew has no <i>bribe</i> to
give you!" exclaimed Luke, with the
most emphatic disgust&mdash;"Hallo!
There he is; far down Seventh Street&mdash;I'll
have him yet!"</p>

<p>And down Seventh Street Luke
started, with as much speed as though
he had a match against time, his hair
and coat-flaps streaming in the wind,
while Buzby Poodle watched his progress
with quiet wonder.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! There he goes like
mad! He's a-diggin' down Seventh
Street&mdash;he nears the Jew! Two to
one on Harvey&mdash;anybody take that
bet? Ha! The Jew turns round&mdash;bravo!
Now the race becomes exciting!
Some little boys join the pursuit&mdash;a
coal heaver flings down his shovel,
and pelts after 'em! The Jew's ahead!
Go it, hump-back! Go it, Harvey!
Hullo! He's got him&mdash;no! He's
clear! He turns down an alley&mdash;they're
gone! I'd like to bet a considerable
amount on the Jew yet.
Hum-hum! Harvey wouldn't buy
me. Bad, that, for Harvey. I can
guess that he entertains some suspicions
with regard to Fitz-Cowles; else why
does he pursue the hump-backed gentleman,
whom I tracked from the
rooms of the 'millionaire?' I think
we must sell Harvey to Fitz-Cowles.
Damme, I'll cut up that fellow Harvey
in to-morrow's Black Mail. I'll be
bitter&mdash;d&mdash;d bitter!"</p>

<p>The State House struck eleven.
His face, all crimson with excitement,

<!-- page 169 col 1 -->

his brow streaming with thick drops
of perspiration, his long hair flying
wildly in the wind, from under the
shadow of a very bad hat, which he
had borrowed from a friend, Luke
Harvey came slowly round the corner
of certain prominent streets in a remote
district of the city, his entire
appearance betraying great exhaustion
of body, mingled with considerable
depression of spirits.</p>

<p>"Nearly two hours passed in chasing
that cursed Jew! Poh! Pretty
figure I cut. The Jew ahead&mdash;a long
tail of boys, sweeps and coal heavers
behind me. Wild chorus of yells
rending the air. People flinging up
their windows&mdash;ha, ha! 'Twig that
man without a hat!' All humbug!
Hullo! Here's the old woman's house!
Damme, I'll go in and see her!"</p>

<p>Luke stood in front of a three storied
dwelling, which, remarkable for its
old and desolate appearance, stood
among a cluster of Pawnbroker shops,
like a decayed gentleman surrounded
by pickpockets and thieves. Thick
masses of rank green moss grew over
the steep roof, and the garret window
was stuffed with an old straw hat and
bundles of rags. The shutters on the
first story were entirely closed, through
the windows of the second floor, faded
green blinds of a damp and mouldy
aspect were visible, while the glasses
of the remaining windows, in the third
story, were concealed by rough boards,
nailed loosely to the window-frame on
the outside. The solitary front door,
was one of your old fashioned front
doors, with massive posts, and heavy
cornices. The old brass knocker was
covered with a thick crust of verdigris,
and all along the door and frame

<!-- page 169 col 2 -->

some industrious hand had driven innumerable
nails, and spikes of every
size and pattern, as though a hardware
merchant had been seized with
an original fancy, and wished to turn
the whole concern into a business card.</p>

<p>In fact, it looked just like the house
which all the restless spirits in the city,
gentlemen and lady ghosts, who frequent
graveyards nightly, and prevail
very numerously in Christmas-time,
about the halls of old mansions, would
choose for their scene of assemblage,
in case the spiritual fraternity, determined
upon a National Convention of
all the ghosts in the union; a sort of
death's head festival, with the Skeleton-God
himself in the chair.</p>

<p>Becky Smolby lived in this ancient
house. Becky Smolby and an Irish
female servant were the only tenants
of the old time mansion. Who Becky
Smolby was, or what were her sources
of livelihood, was a question often
asked, but by no means frequently
answered. Becky was old, penurious
and avaricious; everybody knew
that. Didn't she keep the female servant
for one entire week on stale gingerbread
and sassafras beer? Becky
was queer and whimsical; this point
was never doubted. Did she not keep
candles burning all the day long in
the old mansion, even when she was
starving herself for the want of generous
onion-soups and broiled steaks!
Becky was rich&mdash;aye, aye, old rooms
lumbered with antique but costly furniture,
mysterious caskets standing upon
picturesque sideboards of black mahogany,
great monsters of chests,
stowed away beneath canopied bedsteads,
ribbed with brass bands, and
corded with thick ropes, all bore witness

<!-- page 170 col 1 -->

of Becky's hidden plate and
doubloons. Becky was capricious to
a fault; had she been a little younger,
and worn blue stockings, and talked
dictionary, she would have been termed
a genius, and her whims would
have assumed the shape of amiable
eccentricities, peculiar to a gifted mind.
Becky had four cats and a parrot, by
way of agreeable companions, on whom
she was wont to bestow her daily investments
of good humor, which, as
the reader may judge, were sometimes
remarkably limited in their nature;
while she kept her Irish female servant
as a sort of safety valve for all her
vapors, spites, animosities, and what
was worse than all, her reminiscences
of her five husbands, Buddy, Crank,
Dulpins, Smolby and Tuppick.</p>

<p>How Becky made all her money
was a mystery. The Tariff, Free
Trade, or even the grand question,
"whatever became of the funds of the
United States Bank," were nothing to
it. Some said she had saved it in the
course of matrimonial experience, by
stinting her five husbands; some
averred she had made it by trading at
sea, to Europe and the Indies; others
stated that it had been slowly gathered
at home, in the legitimate exercise
of a profession, which may be dignified
by the name of the Mum-Mum trade.</p>

<p>For instance, a gentleman on whose
back a seedy coat hung very lightly,
in comparison with the firm grasp of
Hard-times (a modern deity) which
was ever on his shoulder, pressing
him steadily down, some day or other
became possessed of a watch, or a few
dozen spoons, or a piece of gold plate,
all in a sudden and mysterious manner.
These costly articles, the gentleman

<!-- page 170 col 2 -->

aforesaid, being modest in his
disposition, and not disposed to aristocratic
ostentation, would transfer to
Becky, for a few hard dollars, or perhaps
a gold eagle or two. While the
transfer was going on, the gentleman
placing his finger to his lips, would
whisper mysteriously the monosyllable,
Mum, to which Becky would reply
with equal brevity and point&mdash;Mum&mdash;wherefore
the transfer was known
as the Mum-Mum trade.</p>

<p>By some means or other, either by
the sea trade, or the Mum-Mum trade,
or by stinting her five husbands, Becky
Smolby had acquired various stores
of gold and silver plate, great chests
full of everything valuable, together
with four or five houses, and a small
court, located in one of the purlieus of
Southwark. Becky was rich, crusty
and ancient; and Becky, in her old
age, had joined a conventicle, which
flourished under the pastoral care of
the Rev. Dr. F. Altamont T. Pyne,
one of those independent gentlemen
who saving souls on their own particular
hook, acquire their degrees from
some unknown college, and hold forth
in some dark alley, two stories up
stairs, where they preach brimstone,
turpentine and Millerism, in large
instalments, according to the taste of
their hearers.*</p>

<p class="small">[*For the religion of Jesus Christ, our Savior
and Intercessor, the author of this work

<!-- page 171 col 1 -->

<p>"Well, well," cried Luke, as he
gazed upon the front of the old house.
"The old lady has always passed for
my aunt&mdash;the man in the moon knows
whether I'm related to her at all! At
all events I'll go in and see her."</p>

<p>He gave a slight tap with the
knocker.</p>

<p>In a large room, furnished in an
old fashioned style, sate the ancient
lady, bending over a small table, on
which was placed two lighted candles,
flinging their glaring light full in her
withered face.</p>

<p>Opposite the old lady, sate a gentleman
of some forty-five, resting in a
capacious arm-chair, his corpulent
form clad in glossy broadcloth, while
his round face, of oily sweetness, was
strikingly relieved by the snow-white
cravat encircling his neck. The sharp
features of the old lady, all their harshness
of outline, thrown out into the
light by the tight-fitting black silk
cap which covered her head, were impressed
with peculiar and distinctive
characteristics. A long aquiline nose,
hooked like an eagle's beak, thick
grey eyebrows meeting together and
shooting up into the forehead at either
extremity like two sides of a triangle;
small dark eyes, quick, piercing and
brilliant in their glance; a wide mouth
with thin lips, much sunken from the
absence of teeth; a pointed chin and
high cheekbones; all gave a stern and
decided expression to the countenance
of the aged dame, which was in strong
contrast with the oily sweetness of the
round face, whose large grey eyes
were gazing in her own.</p>

<p>The Reverend Dr. Pyne; who sate
opposite&mdash;commonly called Fat Pyne,

<!-- page 171 col 2 -->

from the initials of his name, or his
peculiar disposition to blaze up in his
sermons&mdash;was a fine specimen of a
well-preserved dealer in popular credulity.
A red, round face, with thick
lips, watery grey eyes, and lanky hair,
of a doubtful color, mingling white
and brown, and hanging in uneven
masses around the outline of his visage,
formed the details of a countenance
very sanctimonious and somewhat
sensual in its slightest expression.</p>

<p>"Trouble brother Pyne, nothin' but
trouble in this blessed world," said the
widow Smolby, bending over the
small work-stand which separated the
parties. "Only to think o' it! This
very mornin' I was sittin' up stairs in
the back room, with Wes on one side
and Nappy on t'other, when I heard
a knock at the front door. D'ye
mind? Ike was a sittin' in one corner;
Washy was cardin' wool near
the fire; Abe was hanging up against
the winder, when I hears a knock
at the front door&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't know that the old lady's
family was so extensive!" muttered
the Rev. Dr. Pyne&mdash;"Ike, Washy,
Nappy, Wes and Abe! Hired men I
suppose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peggy Grud&mdash;that's the young
woman who lives with me, you know?
She goes to the front door and lets in
a little hump-backed Jew, who wanted
to sell me a gold watch. Ike was a
spinnin' near the fire, as I heered the
Jew's voice below, and Abe was a-hollerin'
murder with all his might, when
I comes down stairs&mdash;Now you know,
Brother Pyne, that a poor lone widow
woman like me, ought to turn an
honest penny whenever she can, and

<!-- page 172 col 1 -->

so, 'cordingly, I buys watches whenever
opport<i>oo</i>nity offers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He that provideth not for his own
house is worse than an infidel&mdash;"
said Brother Pyne, with great oiliness
of manner.</p>

<p>"Considerable. Well, the Jew hands
me the gold watch and I goes up
stairs to compare it with some time-pieces
I has on hand. Abe was a-hollerin'
murder all the while, and Washington
carded wool with all his might.
Napoleon looked in my face as I compared
the watch with another one, jist
as if he'd say'd 'take care old woman,
somethin's wrong about this house, I
<i>do</i> say.' Down stairs I comes, considerin'
the price o' th' watch over in
my mind, when I diskivered that the
Jew was gone! I say&mdash;" she cried,
elevating her voice into a shriek&mdash;"I
diskivered that the Jew was gone!"</p>

<p>"And left his watch with you?
Surely, Sister, this was not the act of
a Jew&mdash;"</p>

<p>"D'ye see that little drawer, in the
old sideboard yonder? D'ye see the
keys a-hanging in the keyhole? When
I went up stairs I left the keys in the
keyhole, jist as they are now&mdash;when
I came down, the keys was jist the
same as ever, but five thousand dollars
in gold, which I, a poor lone woman,
had saved up from five husbands,
was gone! The Jew took 'em! I'm
ruined! I'm ruined! Oh, Lor'! Oh,
Lor'! And Abe a hollerin' murder
all the while&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He cried murder, did he? What
could have induced Abel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It ain't Abel&mdash;" said the old woman,
sharply&mdash;"It's Abraham. I
named him arter the First Patriarch.
Washy I named arter Washington;

<!-- page 172 col 2 -->

Nappy, after Napoleon; Ike, arter
Isaac son o' Abraham, which was the
son of Heber; and Wes, arter the
great and good, Wesley&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bless me Sister, what a numerous
family! Your grand-children I perceive?"</p>

<p>"Grand-children! Och, pelt me
to pieces wid thimbles! They ain't
no grand-childer; only four cats an'
a parrit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now Peggy Grud, who told you
to put in your sixpence?" said the old
woman, turning sharply round to the
new-comer, who stood in the doorway&mdash;"Bless
my soul, if you ain't more
pervokin' nor bad bank-stock!"</p>

<p>"Put in my sixpence, indade! And
you sellin' your soul to the devil for
yer cats and yer parrit! Twist the
necks ov 'em! Wouldn't I, if I had
my will o' th' creeturs!"</p>

<p>Peggy Grud, who had suddenly appeared
in the doorway of the room,
was a tall, stout Irishwoman, coarsely
clad, with large hands, and a withered
face&mdash;looking as though it had been
scorched in some fire and hardened to
the dryness of an Egyptian mummy&mdash;surrounded
by an immense cotton
night-cap, adorned with colossal ruffles.</p>

<p>"And Abe was a-hollerin' murder
all the while&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Sister," said the Rev.
Dr. Pyne, arising; "If I name the
object which brought me here. I came
on an errand of mercy. I have noticed
you, sister, again and again, mingling
with the crowd which weekly fills my
church; the Church of True Believers
and Free Repenters, conducted by
Providence's blissful permission, by
the Rev. Dr. Pyne, up Dorkley's

<!-- page 173 col 1 -->

court, second story, brick building to
the right. Sister, is it not a comfort
for you to think, that however hard
the times may be, there is one thing
cheap&mdash;very cheap&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And that's mackerel!" said the
widow Smolby, with a delighted smile&mdash;"Mackerel
<i>is</i> cheap! I'll stick to
that&mdash;two small 'uns for a fip!
Yes, yes, mackerel is cheap&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, sister, you mistake me. I
meant grace, sister, grace. And talking
of grace, sister, if you have any
small sum about you, which you
would like to invest in a Heavenly
Bank, here is an opportunity which
should not be slighted. A poor man,
sister, with a wife and seven small
children to support, has met with a
sad accident. Ascending a scaffold
with a hod on his shoulder, he fell
from the height of five stories, laming
a negro sweep who was passing at the
time, and injuring a school boy for
life. He fell upon them both, sister&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I say Aunty, let's have a look, at
that watch&mdash;" said a voice proceeding
from the doorway, occupied by the
form of Peggy Grud&mdash;"Let's see the
trinket anyhow."</p>

<p>Luke Harvey advanced toward the
light, his jaws enveloped in a kerchief
of burning red, which gave a singular
and flaming effect, to his entire appearance.</p>

<p>"My nevey, Brother Pyne&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bah!" ejaculated Luke in a whisper
intended for the reverend gentleman's
ears&mdash;"You can't come it, Fat
Pyne."</p>

<p>"Have you a small sum about you,
say five dollars or ten, which you
would like to invest in a Heavenly

<!-- page 173 col 2 -->

Bank?" said the Rev. Dr. in a remarkably
bland whisper.</p>

<p>"Heavenly Bank!" echoed Luke&mdash;"Monk-Hall
for instance?"</p>

<p>"Monk Luke!"</p>

<p>The reverend gentleman turned
aside, and spiritualized a whistle; or
in plainer English, puckered up his
mouth, as though he was about to perform
a lively air, while a faint sound,
like a sigh, was all that escaped his
lips.</p>

<p>"I say Aunt," exclaimed Luke&mdash;"This
Jew must have had some accomplice
in the house. Otherwise how
could he know, that you had five
thousand dollars in yonder drawer?"</p>

<p>"Troth and so he must!" said
Peggy Grud&mdash;"He must have had an
accomplish&mdash;shure!"</p>

<p>"That's jist what I was a-goin' to
tell Brother Pyne," exclaimed the old
lady rising to her feet&mdash;"Three days
ago, there comes, to my house a poor
girl, without cloak, bonnet or shoes,
a-beggin' me to take her in for God's
sake, for somebody was pursuin' her,
and a-goin' to murder her, an' what
not! I took her in; though she would
not tell me her name; I took her in,
gave her bread to eat, and a bed to
sleep on&mdash;here's my thanks I say,
here's my thanks!"</p>

<p>"Ha! This is singular!" exclaimed
Dr. Pyne, his red face turning suddenly
pale&mdash;"Has the girl dark, very
dark hair, and dark eyes? I merely
ask from curiosity?"</p>

<p>"Black as your hat!" vociferated
the Widow Smolby with vehemence&mdash;"Black
as your hat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very pale in the face?" said the
worthy Dr. in a suggestive tone.</p>

<p>"A freshly white-washed wall ain't

<!-- page 174 col 1 -->

no paler!" responded the Widow
Smolby.</p>

<p>"And you suspect that this girl
was a spy, introduced into your house
by the Jew in order to accomplish the
robbery of your five thousand dollars?"
asked Luke, in a quiet tone.</p>

<p>"Don't I? Ain't I a-goin' to give
her up to justice in an hour? Haven't
I penned her up, in the room,
which hasn't been opened for these
seventeen years? The Ghost-Room
as Peggy Grud calls it! To think
that I should outlive five husbands,
Buddy, Crank, Dul&mdash;Dul&mdash;I say Peg,
what was my third husband's name?"</p>

<p>"Dulphins av'it plase ye ma'am!"</p>

<p>"Ye see Brother Pyne, I hadn't
that one more than three months, so I
sometimes forgits his name. Buddy,
Crank, Dulpins, Tuppick, and Smolby;
five husbands in all. To think
that I&mdash;I&mdash;should&mdash;What was I goin'
to say Peg?"</p>

<p>"To think that you should outlive
five husbands, and be robbed afther
all in this murtherin' manner!"</p>

<p>"Jist so. And afore an hour goes
over my head, this girl, shall be placed
in the keer of Alderman Tallowdocket,
that she shall. I'll have justice!"</p>

<p>"<i>Justice</i>, and in the Quaker City!"
said Luke, with a quiet sneer, as folding
his arms across his breast, he
gazed from face to face&mdash;"Justice and
in the Quaker City! A Strange Monster
I trow! One moment it unbolts
the doors of the prison, and bids the
Bank-Director, who boasts his ten
thousand victims, whose ears ring forever
with the curses of the Widow and
the Orphan, it bids the <i>honest</i> Bank-Director,
go forth! The next moment
it bolts and seals those very prison

<!-- page 174 col 2 -->

doors, upon the poor devil, who has
stolen a loaf of bread to save himself
from starvation! One day it stands
grimly smiling while a mob fires a
Church or sacks a Hall, the next, ha,
ha, ha, it hurries from its impartial
throne, and pastes its placards over
the walls of a Theatre, stating in pompous
words, and big capitals, that
THE TRUTH <i>must not be told in
Philadelphia!</i>"</p>

<p>"My friend, you are severe upon
the 'proper authorities,' " exclaimed F.
Altamont T. Pyne, (Pastor of the
church of True Believers and Free
Repenters,) with great suavity of manner.&mdash;"Take
care! There are muzzles,
and prisons, and fines, for those
who speak thus!"</p>

<p>"Justice in the Quaker City! Suppose
the Almighty God, should hold a
Court one day, and try the Justice of
the Quaker City, by his impartial law!
Ha, ha, ha! What a band of witnesses
would come thronging to that
solemn bar, 'Come into court, old
Stephen Girard; come into court with
your will in hand&mdash;that will which
bequeathed your enormous wealth to
the white male orphans of the past, the
present, of generations yet unborn;
come into court, and testify! What
say you of Quaker City justice? Is
your College built? Has a single orphan
been fed, clothed, or educated at
your expense, or with your money?
Come into court, widows and orphans
beggared by the frauds of bank directors,
come into court, in your rags and
misery; come, and testify: That think
you of Justice, as she holds the scales
in Philadelphia? Come into court,
Religion, and point to your churches
in ruins! Come into court, Humanity,

<!-- page 175 col 1 -->

and point to the blackened ashes of the
Asylum, the School House, and the
Hall! Come into court, one and all!
What think ye of Quaker City Justice?'
'Quaker City justice!' cries old
Stephen Girard. 'Where is my College?
A generation has past away
since my death; where is my College,
where is my money?' 'Quaker City
Justice!' shout the widows and the
orphans. 'By its decision we walk
in penury and rags, while the bank
director, who robbed us, rides in his
coach-and-four.' 'Then, in God's
name, what has this solemn mockery,
Justice in the Quaker City, ever accomplished?'
It has laughed pleasantly
while riot after riot, went howling
through the town; it has chuckled
gaily as it bade assassin after assassin,
go scatheless from its bar; it
has grown violent in glee, as it beheld
its judicial halls, soiled by the footsteps
of corruption; and, now and then, it
has crept from off its lazar-throne,
and arrested an editor who raised his
voice for the right; or stopped a play,
that dared speak out for the truth!"*</p>

<div class="small">

<p>[*Luke Harvey, in his usual sneering style,
deals not only in gross anachronisms but in
arrant falsehoods. In order that the readers
of this book, at a distance from Philadelphia,
may not be deceived by Luke's anti-Philadelphia
tirade, we deem it proper to state a
few facts.&mdash;Girard College has been built for
years, and has been the home of some thousand
orphans, who have been fed, clothed,
and educated, at the expense of good old
Stephen. Everybody knows this to be true.
Bank directors are always convicted in Philadelphia,
when tried for robbing widows and
orphans. Widows and orphans, plundered
by bank directors, never starve in Philadelphia.
The Quaker city is too charitable for
that. Churches have <i>never</i> been burned in
Philadelphia. Nor halls fired, nor orphans'
asylums sacked, nor school houses, given up
to a mob. Not in the least. The play of an

<!-- page 175 col 2 -->

author, who dared speak out for the truth, has
never been <i>ukase</i>-d in this city. Never. <i>A
contemptible coalition of charlatans, have never
resorted to threats of assassination in order to
put down a work, which held them up to public
scorn.</i> Never, never!</p>

<p>This is a great city, and its dignitaries are
great men, worthy of all respect.</p>

<p>Pity for them that their rule is so brief!
Why not have an ordinance passed by the
Councils, to make the dog days last all the
year, and forever?]</p>

</div>

<p>"Well, well, Luke, ain't you most
out o' breath?" said the Widow Smolby,
rubbing her hands together. "But
that ain't nayther here nor there.
Afore an hour goes over my head, this
gal, who is now up stairs, in the Ghost
Room, shall be tuk to Alderman Tallowdocket's,
and bound over for this
'ere robbery."</p>

<p>"Could I see the young lady for a
few moments, alone?" said Dr. Pyne,
with his usual bland smile. "It would
be such a comfort to tell her, that in
the next world, she'll be burned up
forever and ever. It would, indeed."</p>

<p>"I 'spect you <i>can't</i> see her, brother.
I'd rather not. Come this
way, Luke, and I'll show you the
watch."</p>

<p>The old lady led the way up two
pair of dark stairs, followed by Luke.
In a few moments, they stood in a
large room, on the third floor, whose
outlines, Luke might dimly discern by
the glimmer of the candle, which the
old lady grasped in her hand. It was
wide and spacious, the floor covered
with carpet of an ancient though costly
pattern, while the ceiling was emblazoned
with a picture in fresco,
whose gorgeous hues had been softened
down by time. Massive velvet
curtains hung along the three windows,
which, facing the street, were

<!-- page 176 col 1 -->

hermetically closed, by the boards
outside the sashes. A bed with a lofty
canopy, was in one corner; an antique
dressing bureau, surmounted by
a circular mirror, stood in the space
between two of the windows; a wide
hearth, with ashes and loose pieces of
half burned wood scattered over the
bricks, extended along one entire end
of the chamber, while the wall above
the mantel, was concealed by a large
picture, set in a gorgeous frame. It
was the picture of a fair and lovely
girl, remarkable for the brilliancy of
her eyes, and the midnight blackness
of her hair.</p>

<p>It was a singular circumstance,
which did not escape the notice of
Luke, that the carpet was covered
with thick dust, as though it had not
been open for years, while the velvet
of the window curtains, the gilt of the
massive portrait frame, and the hangings
of the bed, were all obscured by
the same thick, grey dust, and hung
with heavy spider webs.</p>

<p>"Ghost Room, indeed!" muttered
Luke; "why look here, aunt, the carpet
is covered with dust, and the air is
damp and unwholesome as a grave
vault. What's the meaning of all
this, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"It has not been opened since she
died, until this day!" said the Widow
Smolby, as her features, withered and
wrinkled as they were, glowed with
an expression of strange feeling.
"She died in yonder bed. I held her
in my arms. Her child lay dead upon
her bosom. Yon hearth d'ye see it,
Luke? The fire went out when she
died&mdash;it has never been lighted
since!"</p>

<p>"What mean you?" cried Luke,

<!-- page 176 col 2 -->

amazed at the agitation of the old woman.
"Ha!" he shouted, ere she
could answer his question. "Here is
the watch on the dressing bureau! It
is Fitz-Cowles', by my life! The Jew
must have stolen it from him! Fitz-Cowles
once told me, that his name
was inscribed within the case. Hold
the light while I open it, Aunt. Ha!
What is this! A memorandum on a
slip of paper, in Fitz-Cowles' hand,
inserted between the case and the
body of the watch! '<i>In Charleston</i>,'
on such a date&mdash;'<i>Must be in Philadelphia</i>,'
on another date. '<i>Ellis
Mortimer</i>,' ho, ho, ho! We've tracked
the fox at last! Ellis Mortimer,
and the hump-backed Jew are one!
Fitz-Cowles is the master villain! Before
to-morrow night, I'll have him,
ha, ha, ha, where <i>patchoully</i> can't
sweeten him!"</p>

<p>"Why, Luke, what in the world's
the matter with you!" cried the Widow
Smolby, in utter wonder. "You
go on like mad. Howsomever, here's
the Jew's accomplice, sleeping in the
bed! Don't she sleep sound, for such
a guilty thief?"</p>

<p>Leading the way along the floor, the
old lady pushed aside the cobweb-hung
curtains, and gazed upon the
sleeper's form.</p>

<p>"Ha! The dead have come to
life!" She shrieked, starting backward.&mdash;"It
is not the stranger; it is
my daughter, just as she looked nineteen
years ago, when she was pure
and innocent! Look, Luke; look, I
say! That pale face, that long dark
hair, that lily white hand! I'd swear
it was my daughter come to life!"</p>

<p>Advancing to the bedside, Luke
gazed upon the sleeper's form, as it

<!-- page 177 col 1 -->

lay dimly disclosed by the light of the
flickering candle.</p>

<p>The face of a fair young girl, relieved
by long tresses of jet-black
hair, broke like a dream upon his
gaze. True it was, the young form,
thrown along the bed, in an attitude
of slumber, was clad in a dress of
tattered rags, yet the outline of a
figure ripening from the bud of maidenhood
into the bloom of beauty and
womanhood, might be discerned, beneath
the disguise of mean apparel;
true it was, the face, pale as death,
bore the traces of a long life of sorrow,
yet were the features regular, the dark
eyebrows, pencilled and arching, the
brow was calm and white, full of the
silent grandeur of intellect, while the
rounded outline of the cheeks, the
fulness of the pouting lips, and the
dimple of the chin, all bespoke the
youth and loveliness of the sleeper.</p>

<p>"Thus nineteen years ago, she lay
upon that bed! My only daughter!
Seventeen years ago, upon that bed,
she breathed her last! Since that
hour, the light of day has not shown
within the walls of this house! Since
that hour I have not stepped beyond
the threshold of my home! And now&mdash;now&mdash;she
has arisen from the dead!"</p>

<p>"And this," cried Luke, gazing in
silent wonder upon the pale yet beautiful
face of the sleeper, "this is the
accomplice of the Jew!"</p>

<p>Luke's exclamation aroused the
old woman from her waking dream.
Her daughter, for whom she had
mourned so long, was forgotten when
she remembered the five thousand dollars
stolen from her house that very
morning by the Jew, whose accomplice
lay sleeping on the bed.</p>

<!-- page 177 col 2 -->

<p>"The huzzy!" she cried, shaking
her fist at the form of the unconscious
girl&mdash;"To steal my hard earnings, and
arter I'd given her a home and a bed,
without so much as axing her name!
But I'll have justice! That I will,
Luke! To jail with the trollop!"</p>

<p>"I tell you what it is Aunt&mdash;" exclaimed
Luke, with his gaze rivetted
to the face of the lovely girl&mdash;"Promise
me that you will not consign this
child to the care of the Police until to-morrow
morning, and I give you my
word, that before sunrise your five
thousand dollars shall be safe in your
hands again!"</p>

<p>"You never yet broke your word
to me, Luke! You've got my promise.
But mind you keep yours! Hush!
She wakes!"</p>

<p>The lids of the sleeper, fringed with
long dark lashes, slowly unclosed, and
her eyes, large, dark and brilliant
gazed wonderingly around. In a moment
the glance of wonder changed
to one of the deepest terror.</p>

<p>"MY FATHER!" she shrieked,
starting up in the bed and gazing
fixedly over Luke's shoulder.</p>

<p>Luke turned hastily around. The
Rev. Dr. Pyne stood by his side with
his smooth face all radiant with an
expression whose doubtful meaning of
malignancy and triumph Luke found
it difficult to fathom.</p>

<p>"MY FATHER!" again shrieked the
girl, crouching up in the bed, with her
limbs all huddled together as though
she anticipated a violent blow.</p>

<p>"My child, you please me&mdash;" said
Brother Pyne, mildly. "You recognize
your parent. You repent your
late flight from his roof? You will
return to your home?"</p>

<!-- page 178 col 1 -->

<p>"To the prison!" shrieked the girl;
"to the cell, to the gibbet, anywhere
you please, but not to <i>him!</i> For
God's sake, good woman, do with me
what you will, but save me from his
power! He is my father, but sooner
than return to his roof again, I would
drag out the life of a convict within a
dungeon's walls, I would beg my bread
on the highway, I would&mdash;I would&mdash;Stand
back from the bedside! Back!
Back, I say, or you will drive me
mad! Ah! Ah! I see it all again!
That scene&mdash;the night I fled from your
roof! Oh God, oh God!"</p>

<p>She fell prostrate on the bed, her
limbs writhing in a convulsive spasm,
while her cheek grew like death, and
the white foam hung on her livid lips.</p>

<p>"THIS, you see, is my Museum.
My Museum, Livingstone! A little
of everything from all parts of the
world. In that jar a negro child with
two heads. Preserved in spirits. Capital
specimen of a double-headed negro.
Ought to have been at Hall this morning;
cut off a poor fellow's arm. Took
it quite lively. Henry Clay&mdash;seen
my blood horse, Henry Clay? Splendid
creature, capital action, glorious
gait. Paid eight hundred for him.
Make a good President; in favor of
the Tariff; chivalrous fellow. Got a
soul, Livingstone, a soul, I say, and
a big soul it is, too!"</p>

<p>"Which do you mean, McTorniquet&mdash;the

<!-- page 178 col 2 -->

blood-horse or the statesman?"</p>

<p>"Ah! Hum! You're disposed to
be jocular! Why the fact is, I'm
such an admirer of the statesman,
that whenever I begin with praising
the horse I'm sure to slide into an expression
of feeling with regard to the
man. Singular specimen of an arm,
that. In that long jar. Took it off
the body of a man who was hung for
robbing the mail. Hand had seven
fingers. By-the-bye, did you hear
that Henry Clay won the purse at the
last races? He didn't run&mdash;he <i>flew!</i>
All stuff about that duel with Randolph!
Randolph came on the field
in a morning-gown! Who the d&mdash;l
ever heard of fighting a duel in that
way? Pshaw!"</p>

<p>"By-the-bye, Doctor, what erroneous
notions have come down to our
time, with regard to Poisons! Now,
some credulous historians would have
us believe that in the time of Catharine
De Medicis the art of poisoning
was carried to such perfection that a
feather, a glove, or a perfume, impregnated
with a chemical preparation,
would send the victim quietly to his
long home. All fudge&mdash;isn't it Doctor?"</p>

<p>"Fudge?" echoed Doctor McTorniquet,
raising his tall form to its extreme
height, while his long black
morning gown floated loosely round
his spare limbs&mdash;"Fudge! Let me
tell you, Livingstone, that I have devoted
some small portion of my time
to the study of Chemistry. It's very
well to encourage the idea that
these legends about Catharine De
Medicis' poisons are all&mdash;fudge&mdash;for,
were the truth known, there would be

<!-- page 179 col 1 -->

an end of all civilized society. Do
you know that there are poisons so
stealthy and subtle in their operations,
that the minutest particle infused into
a drink, mingled with food, laid gently
on the victims lips, will produce instantaneous
death?"</p>

<p>"But such a death will be attended
with marks of violence?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, Livingstone! No
mark of violence, no sign of murder
attests the manner of the death. The
victim lays as though he (or she) had
but fallen asleep. What d'ye suppose
would be the consequence, were these
chemical secrets made known?"</p>

<p>"Very disastrous, I presume&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just fancy what a world it would
make! A lawyer picks a quarrel
with a judge, and sends him to Heaven
with a whiff of a perfume. Two clergymen
disagree on matters of controversial
divinity&mdash;one makes the other a
present of a pair of gloves! W-h-ew!
He's gone! A lady jilts her lover&mdash;he
sends her a magnificent Bird of
Paradise, tipped with poison! The
lady jilts no more lovers! Two candidates
are running for office&mdash;one puts a
pill in t'other's brandy, and kills him
off, on the eve of th' 'lection. Delightful
world it would make! Tom poisons
Dick; Dick poisons Harry; Harry
poisons his wife, and his wife poisons&mdash;the
d&mdash;l knows who!"</p>

<p>"You've a very poor opinion of
human nature, McTorniquet?"</p>

<p>"You've hit it! It's a way we doctors
have. God Almighty trusts us
with very little knowledge of the grand
mysteries of nature, for fear we'll
abuse our gift. Why Livingstone,
d'ye know that were this secret and
most subtle poison generally known,

<!-- page 179 col 2 -->

half the men in town would give their
wives an eternal leave of absence?
And <i>vice versa</i>. Precious world we'd
have!"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha, Doctor! You take
such an original view of things! By-the-bye,
have you seen my wife this
morning? Did she expect me back
from New York so soon?"</p>

<p>"Saw Mrs. Livingstone this morning,
and cautioned her about your disease.
Egad Albert, you must be very
careful! Ticklish disease <i>that!</i> One
moment lively as a bird; the next,
stiff as a poker! Have you seen
Henry Clay lately? Grand speech
that: his farewell to the Senate! Wait
a moment and I'll go round to the stable
and order the servant to trot him
out. Would you like to see a manuscript
volume of mine, on the Theory
of Poisons? Here it is in this Cabinet.
Just take a peep at it while I run round
and have Henry Clay brought to the
front door. Put it back in the Cabinet
when you've gratified your curiosity.
Back in a minute, Livingstone!"</p>

<p>Livingstone took the small volume
of manuscript in his hand and eagerly
turned over the leaves. He was alone.
He stood in McTorniquet's Museum,
surrounded by shelves piled with surgical
curiosities, preserved in jars, or
hanging by parti-colored strings, or,
yet again, huddled carelessly together.
The very air was reminiscent of the
scalpel and the torniquet. Dead men
in fragments, in great pieces and little,
in all shapes and every form, were
scattered around. In the full light
of the window, fashioned in the ceiling
of the room, stood a grisly skeleton,
one hand placed on his thigh-bone
while the other, with the fingers stuck

<!-- page 180 col 1 -->

in the cavity of the nose, seemed performing
the stale jest, common with
the boys along the street. "You
can't come it Mister, by no manner o'
means!" that gesture said, as plainly
as a skeleton's gesture can say.</p>

<p>" 'In the days of Catharine De
Medicis' "&mdash;murmured Livingstone,
reading from the manuscript volume&mdash;"
'there was prepared by her command,
a poison, combining in its nature,
the most deadly chemical attributes.
This poison laid its victim
down in the sleep of death without a
mark of violence, without the slightest
sign of murder, to tell the tale of an
untimely death. Subtle and penetrating
in its nature, most fearfully opposed
to the Principle of life, in its
mildest form; this poison was prepared
by the Alchemist Ellarbin
D'Zoisboign&eacute;, after the study of
years passed in searching for the
Grand Secret, the Water of Life.
The Alchemist sold the poison to the
Queen, for the price of one of her
royal jewels. Secure of the deadly
preparation, and aware of the manner
in which it was to be used, the Queen
determined that the secret of its composition
should rest with her alone.
The Alchemist was her first victim.
Among various strange legends of
medical lore, the poison, its various
qualities, and the secret of its preparation,
have descended to modern
times. It is prepared thus&mdash;' "</p>

<p>Livingstone paused. The terrible
idea which had rested upon his brain,
since the scene of the past night,
now began to take form and shape.
He saw the horrible path which he
was doomed to tread, more clearly
and distinctly in its minutest windings.</p>

<!-- page 180 col 2 -->

<p>He listened intently for a single
moment. There was no sound of the
Doctor's returning footstep. The
Museum was still as the grave. And
yet, as the fatal idea rose blackening
Livingstone's brain, with all its details
of horror, the very air of the room
grew stifling, and he could distinctly
hear the beatings of his own heart.</p>

<p>Ere another moment passed, seizing
a lancet which lay on an adjoining
shelf, with a calm and cautious movement,
Livingstone severed the leaf,
which he had just read, from the
manuscript volume, and folding it in
letter form, placed it within the breast
of his overcoat.</p>

<p>"Close to the keepsakes&mdash;next to
my heart!" he grimly smiled, as he
placed the manuscript volume in the
cabinet again&mdash;"Three days ago, I
little dreamed that Catharine De Medicis
would become serviceable to me!"</p>

<p>He quietly passed from the room
and from the house. Hurrying along
the crowded street, in the course of
fifteen minutes he arrived before his
stately mansion. At the very door he
was met by Luke Harvey, who had
just returned from his visit to the
widow Smolby's house.</p>

<p>"Is it noon&mdash;" exclaimed Luke,
with a quiet smile&mdash;"Here are the
fruits of my morning's labors!"</p>

<p>He placed in the Merchant's hands
the memorandum which he had taken
from the stolen watch.</p>

<p>Livingstone started, but in an instant
recovered the fearful composure which
had marked his demeanor since the
fatal scene at Monk-Hall.</p>

<p>"I bear it well! Do I not, Luke?"
he calmly exclaimed. "So, so! He
is not only the&mdash;the Adulterer, but

<!-- page 181 col 1 -->

the Swindler and Forger! We can
settle both accounts at once!"</p>

<p>"There is enough in that slight
memorandum to excite suspicion,"
exclaimed Luke, "but not enough to
produce conviction. Leave the matter
in my hands, and before Friday
night&mdash;that's to-morrow&mdash;the fellow
will be in the hands of the police."</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning Dora and I
start for Hawkewood&mdash;" replied Livingstone,
with a slight smile&mdash;"By-the-bye,
while you are procuring the
necessary documents for the conviction
of the forger, we must be sure
that he does not leave the city. Ha,
ha! I have it! Let us walk down
the street while I let you into my
plans."</p>

<p>They were walking down the street,
whispering earnestly together, when
a hand was laid upon Livingstone's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Look here, Curnel&mdash;you don't
forgit old friends, do you?" said a
bluff voice, which sounded very much
like the deep bass of an oysterman.</p>

<p>"Why, Larkspur, is that you? I'd
scarcely have known you! Why,
what's the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"Nothin' much. Only there was
a change in the admineystration.&mdash;Easy
Larkspur was turned out. Konsekence
is, he persents a pictur' for the
portrait painter, and the daily papers.
Does not he?"</p>

<p>Easy Larkspur, as the new-comer
was styled, certainly presented a picture,
and a very remarkable picture it
was, too. He was a short, stout man,
with broad shoulders, and a tolerably
corpulent person. His face was remarkable
for its crimson hue, and its
immensity of jaw or cheek, as the

<!-- page 181 col 2 -->

reader pleases. His costume was at
once picturesque and simple. A short
gray roundabout, exhibiting glimpses
of a saffron shirt, at the elbows, and
buttoned up to the neck across his
muscular chest; corduroy trowsers,
reaching to the calf, agreeably variegated
with patches of various colors,
and a pair of shoes, rather the worse
for the wear, with the heels worn
away all at one side, and picturesque
crevices near the toes. Easy Larkspur
wore no stockings. Such things
as stockings had been invented long
after man had departed from his primitive
simplicity of manners; Easy
Larkspur was above wearing stockings.
The hat which surmounted Mr.
Larkspur's broad face, was quite a
curiosity in its way. In material it
was rather flimsy, being fashioned
of common straw; in shape it was
singular, bearing a strong resemblance,
to nothing in heaven above, or
on earth beneath, or in the waters
under the earth. Speculative people
would have called it a shocking bad
hat. You might have fallen down
and worshipped it, without any violation
of the commandment. The picturesque
appearance of the hat was
rather increased by a glimpse of a
dingy red handkerchief, which peeped
from the crevices of the crown, like a
quiet observer, taking a view of the
world, from a favorable elevation.</p>

<p>"Why, Larkspur, where have you
been all this while?"</p>

<p>"Two years ago, I was turned out
of the Police. Since that time I've
been perambulating the continent.
Part of the time, as a Tuppygraphical
ingineer; I carried the chain on the
railroad. Part of the time, I was ingaged

<!-- page 182 col 1 -->

in the mercantile marine service:
drove the horse on the canawl.
I attributes the present depression of
my funds to the cursed Whig tariff of
'42. It must be that; for, deuce take
me, if I know what else it can be!"</p>

<p>"Larkspur, would you like to earn
a hundred dollars?"</p>

<p>"Jist try me. I'm putty desp'rate
now, I tell you. I might accept."</p>

<p>"Could you assume the manners
of a Southern planter?"</p>

<p>"What d'ye mean? Swear a few
big oaths, carry a Bowie knife, and
talk about my niggers? I jist could
do that, and nothing else."</p>

<p>"Go down to my store, in Front
Street, Larkspur, and wait for me,"
said Livingstone, turning toward his
mansion again. "Luke, attend to
the accomplice of the Forger, in the
den of Monk-Hall. I'll see that the
Forger himself does not leave the
city."</p>

<p>It was in this state of mind, with
his plans of vengeance fully matured,
and his soul determined upon the prosecution
of those plans, that Livingstone
sought the presence of his wife,
and passed through the scene in her
boudoir, which we have already described.*</p>

<p class="small">[*See Chapter Fourth&mdash;Dora Livingstone
at Home.]</p>

<p>"The girl is beautiful" Luke soliloquized
as Livingstone and Larkspur
passed on their separate ways, leaving
him alone in the street. "Beautiful
as a dream! Pshaw, Luke, this folly
ought not to move you again! Jilted
once, and again in love! and with
whom? A nobody, who, coming from
nowhere, knocks at old Widow Smolby's
door, and begs admittance, but

<!-- page 182 col 2 -->

won't give her name! Fat Pyne, her
father too&mdash;hum&mdash;that's suspicious,
to say the least! Aunt Smolby, promised
that the girl should not leave
her roof, until she heard from me.&mdash;There's
mystery about the thing, take
it as you will, and so&mdash;as I said last
night&mdash;when hurrying down this very
street&mdash;I say now! To Monk-Hall!"</p>

<p>"I HAVE gathered the fruit, and it
is ashes!"</p>

<p>Lorrimer was alone in the Rose
Chamber. The light of the candle,
fast waning to the socket, streamed in
fitful flashes over his wan and pallid
face. Thus had he sate for hours, his
arms crossed over his breast, his face
drooped low on his clasped hands,
while his hazel eyes glanced vacantly
in the flickering light from beneath the
shadow of his corrugated brows. Thus
had he sate, while the morning dawned
over river, and steeple, and roof;
and as the day wore on, filling the
darkest nooks and avenues of the old
city with the noonday beams of the
winter sun, he remained silent and
alone, stricken with a strange apathy
his very soul impressed with a fear,
whose nature he might not analyze,
and his heart imbued with a terrible
remorse for the irreparable wrong.</p>

<p>"I have gathered the fruit and it is
ashes!" he murmured&mdash;"Oh, would
to heaven, that before the commission
of this wrong, I had known my heart!
Would that I had felt, twelve hours

<!-- page 183 col 1 -->

ago, now dear this girl would have
been to me as a wife! How she
would have wound herself into my
heart, and grown into my very existence;
the life of my life, and of my
soul, a better and a purer soul!
Curses, eternal curses upon the creed
of the heart-cankered worldling which
has dragged Mary to ruin, and which
will&mdash;ha, ha, ha&mdash;within a few brief
days, hasten her wronger to an untimely
and unwept death!"</p>

<p>"Death?" echoed a hoarse voice&mdash;"Short
word that, but good as a
med'cin' to cure some disorders! I
say Monk Gusty, what shall we do
with the feller?"</p>

<p>"With Byrnewood&mdash;" muttered
Lorrimer, turning his head slowly
round and gazing upon the form of
Devil-Bug, who stood at his side, with
his usual hideous grin&mdash;"With Byrnewood,
you mean?"</p>

<p>"With Byrnewood or the feller, jist
as you like! About these times I konsiders
him a putty disagreeable feller,
I does that! He's a-layin' on the floor
of the Walnut Room, half dead with
opium, and all sorts o' drugs! He
won't come to his senses for hours
yet.&mdash;But Gusty, what shall we do
with him, when he does come to his
senses. That's the pint which I wants
to argur!"</p>

<p>"And the gal, what shall we do
with the gal?" interrupted a voice proceeding
from the other side of the
room&mdash;"She's been sleepin' in the
Painted Chamber ever since daylight.
At fust she took on considerable, but
a drop o' laud'num in her coffee settled
that business! What shall I tell
her ven she vakes?"</p>

<p>Mother Nancy, with her sharp features

<!-- page 183 col 2 -->

and colloped cheeks twisted into
an expression of sneering malignity,
approached Lorrimer, and laid her
withered hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Tell her what you please, but
leave me to myself!" and as Lorrimer
spoke, his brow darkened with
a frown, "and Devil-Bug, mark me&mdash;I
would be alone!</p>

<p>"Very well, ve-r-y well! When
the feller gits over the opium, I'll axe
him down stairs very perlitely, and
tell him to dig off! Vonder how that
'll vork? He won't come back with
the poleese&mdash;o'course not. Monk
Gusty won't be jugged up for makin'
too free, with another man's darter?
The feller's a nateral born fool what
thinks it!"</p>

<p>"Come, come, young man," cried
Mother Nancy, squaring her elbows,
"it may suit you to sit here mopin'
and mopin', over spilt milk, but it
don't suit me, I tell you! Suppose
this young chap, Byrnewood, or
Byrnecoal, or whatever his name is,
leaves Monk-Hall, what 'll be the
konsekence? Monk-Hall will be torn
up, root and branch, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Our leetle family joys walked into
like bricks!" suggested Devil-Bug.&mdash;"Cuss
that light, how it flares!"</p>

<p>"And what remedy do you propose?"
exclaimed Lorrimer, as his
face changed to a death-like pallor,
was illumined by a sudden glare of
light.</p>

<p>"I perpose to keep a tight hold on
the gal!" said Mother Nancy, with a
pleasant smile. "Nothin' like bein'
on the safe side! And then, Gusty,
you can have a little bird to yerself,
all in this old cage of Monk-Hall, and
nobody be the wiser!"</p>

<!-- page 184 col 1 -->

<p>"And as for Byrnewood," suggested
Lorrimer, turning to Devil-Bug.</p>

<p>"I perpose to keep a tight hold on
<i>him</i>, too!"</p>

<p>The face of the doorkeeper of
Monk-Hall, was crossed by a hideous
smile. His solitary eye glared with
sudden intensity, and the muscles of
his countenance were agitated for a
single moment, by a violent and convulsive
movement.</p>

<p>"What mean you?" exclaimed
Lorrimer, starting with involuntary
terror, as he beheld the purpose of
Devil-Bug's soul, gleaming from his
loathsome face.</p>

<p>"Cuss it, how that light flickers in
the socket!" Devil-Bug calmly answered,
raising his hand to his protuberant
brow, and smoothing the
matted hair to one side.&mdash;"What do
I mean?" he continued gazing at Lorrimer
through the outspread fingers of
his hand&mdash;"Nothin o' konsekence!
Only the young feller will not come
to his senses, till long arter dark, and
then&mdash;and then&mdash;cuss the light, it's

<p>CHAPTER EIGHTH.</p>

<p class="small">MAJOR RAPPAHANNOCK MULHILL.</p>

</div>

<p>ARRAYED in all the paraphernalia
of his walking costume, Fitz-Cowles
was threading his way among the
crowd of loiterers, who daily occupy
the pavement in front of Independence
Hall. His brow was clouded by a
frown, and once or twice, as he walked

<!-- page 184 col 2 -->

along, he allowed his gold-headed
cane to fall on the hard bricks, with a
ringing sound. It was evident that
the gallant Colonel, in all the glory
of his original hat, his tight-fitting
overcoat, his long dark hair, his white
kid gloves, and gold-headed cane, was
still somewhat ruffled in temper, and
disturbed in soul.</p>

<p>"This woman!" he muttered,
" 'Gad I never knew her match!
Bold, reckless, and dangerous! I
must take care! Dora, with her imprudence,
may frustrate all my
schemes, and scatter my fortunes to
the wind! I stand upon a dangerous
height! A step higher, and I arrive
at the object of all my desires, unlimited
wealth and safety! A step
lower, a single misplaced movement,
and&mdash;ugh! The prison, the convict's
cell, and&mdash;it makes my flesh creep&mdash;the
lash, are mine!"</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! Fitz-Cowles! I've just
been seeking for you!"</p>

<p>"Is that you, Livingstone! Which
way are you bound? Up Chestnut
Street or down?"</p>

<p>"Colonel Fitz-Cowles, allow me,
to make you acquainted with Major
Rappahannock Mulhill, of Mulhill
Plantation, South Carolina. A planter
from the South, Colonel," suggested
Livingstone, in a whisper; "rich as
Girard. Lands without limit, and a
gold mine!"</p>

<p>"I am proud of your acquaintance,
sir," replied Fitz-Cowles, graciously
extending his hand to the stranger.
"Queer specimen of a planter," he
muttered to himself.&mdash;"Wonder if
he's keen at the cards? I must try
him at Faro!"</p>

<p>"Sur! Happy of the honor! I like

<!-- page 185 col 1 -->

you&mdash;you're of the right stripe&mdash;'the
real pig,' as we say at Mulhill," observed
the Southern planter, clapping
Fitz-Cowles on the back.&mdash;"May I be
cussed, Curnel, if I don't think you're
got the real allegator eye, which give
sich wiwacity to the phizzes of us
bloods, from down South!"</p>

<p>Col. Fitz-Cowles had seen many
queer specimens of the Southern
planter, but this gentleman was decidedly
the queerest of all. Rappahannock
Mulhill, was a stout, thickset
gentleman, with a round, red face,
and a corpulent paunch. His dress
was at once singular and effective, as
the playbills have it. A broad-brimmed
hat, of raw felt, with a
round crown, and a long blue cord, to
which was appended a tassel, that hung
drooping to the Major's shoulders. A
deep crimson velvet waistcoat, double-breasted,
and buttoned up to the
throat. Pants made very full and
wide, and striped like fancy bed-ticking;
a sky blue coat with glaring
metal buttons; yellow buckskin
gloves; tight boots of patent French
leather, and a check neckerchief, tied
in an enormous bow, and affording
free play to the colossal shirt collar,
which rose to the Major's ears. Had
you seen the Major, thus attired, walking
along Chestnut Street, you would
have said, that there was only one
thing wanting to complete the general
finish of his appearance; a cane of
the proper style and dimensions. This
want was supplied, by an enormous
stick or club, which the Major grasped
in his right hand. Bending in a
dozen ways, all twisted, and curled,
and knotted, it looked as though it
might have been, the root of the Tariff,

<!-- page 185 col 2 -->

which politicians have been endeavoring
to find for years.</p>

<p>"How did you leave all the folks
down South, Major?"</p>

<p>"Lively"&mdash;replied the Major, pulling
up his shirt collar&mdash;"Lively!
Roasted an Abolitionist the day afore
I left, for tryin' to steal my niggers.
Lynched a Yankee, the day afore that,
for sellin' me some Jersey cider for
sham-pane! Things is werry lively
in our diggins, jist now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I suppose you've been in a few
knock-downs in your time?" observed
Fitz-Cowles condescendingly.</p>

<p>"Can't say much for my skill in
that line, Curnel&mdash;" replied the Major,
still tugging away at his shirt collar,
while he grew suddenly red in the
face&mdash;"Killed four or five fellers in a
duel. Took 'em one after another.
Had to pay their funeral expenses.
Very low business. The Sheriff had
the imp<i>oo</i>dence to get a warrant out,
for me. There it is&mdash;I've preserved
it to this day as a coorosity!"</p>

<p>"Why it looks quite fresh&mdash;" observed
Fitz-Cowles, looking at the
document which Mulhill held in his
extended hand&mdash;"Very fresh, indeed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's because I have kept it
in spirits: a warrant's sich a coorosity
down South&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Colonel, if you'll excuse me, I
wish to speak a word with the Major
before I resign him to your care.
Major will you walk this way a moment&mdash;"</p>

<p>He led the Major beyond the hearing
of Fitz-Cowles, and glanced quietly
over his shoulder at the millionaire
as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Larkspur, how can you be so

<!-- page 186 col 1 -->

hazardous!" exclaimed Livingstone&mdash;"His
name on that very warrant, and
the signature of the Mayor at the bottom!"</p>

<p>"Werry true&mdash;" replied Easy Larkspur,
alias Rappahannock Mulhill,
"werry true. The Ma'or swore me
in as Depitty Poleesman. He, he!
The idea-r! My comin' the Southern
planter over him, when I've got a
warrant in my pocket for his arrest!
I say, Livingstone, you're a perfect
Ericcson Perpellar for fun, you are!"</p>

<p>"Remember, Larkspur!" whispered
Livingstone, in a deep and hurried
tone&mdash;"Remember the injunctions
which Mr. Harvey gave you. At
three o'clock you are to leave this
civet cat, and with a dozen policemen
at your back, hasten down town to
<i>the house</i>&mdash;you know the rest? After
that business has been settled, you are
to hang on to Fitz-Cowles, until all
our plans are matured; you understand?"</p>

<p>"Don't I? Good mornin', Livingstone&mdash;"
he added aloud, as strutting
to Fitz-Cowles' side, he waved his
hand to the Merchant&mdash;"Call and
see us at the Ton House when you've
time."</p>

<p>"What a monster!" muttered Fitz-Cowles&mdash;"Red
vest and blue coat!
However, there's money to be made
by cultivating this creature. Walk
up to the Ton House, Major, and
smoke a cigar&mdash;" he added aloud, in
the most insinuating tone imaginable.</p>

<p>"I always carries my appeyratus
with me," said the Major, taking a
box of Lucifer matches from one
pocket, and a large German pipe from
the other&mdash;"Nothin' like bein' pervided
with these things in case of accident.

a pipe in Chestnut Street, is it Curnel?
Never mind&mdash;we're the rale alleygaters&mdash;we
are."</p>

<p>And taking the Colonel's arm within
his own, the Major strutted down
Chestnut Street, his immense pipe attracting
the attention of all bystanders,
while Fitz-Cowles regarded both pipe
and planter with a look of smothered
disgust.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" chuckled Livingstone,
as he gazed after the retreating
pair&mdash;"The handsome millionaire
arm in arm with a police officer!"</p>

<p>CHAPTER NINTH.</p>

<p class="small">THE DEAD-VAULT OF MONK-HALL.</p>

</div>

<p>THE beams of the lanthern flashed
over a wide cellar, whose arched roof
was supported by massive pillars of
unplastered brick. Here and there,
as the flickering light glanced fitfully
along the dark recesses of the place,
fragments of wood might be discovered,
scattered carelessly around the
pillars, or thrown over the floor in
crumbling heaps.</p>

<p>Every moment, as the light of the
lanthern shifted from side to side,
some new wonder was discovered.
Now the solid plastering of the ceiling.
now the massive oak of the floor, now
the uncouth forms of the pillars with
loose bricks and crumbling pieces of
wood scattered around, and now, as
a gleam of light shot suddenly into the
distant recesses of the cellar, a long
row of coffins might be discovered, with
the lids broken off and the bones of

<!-- page 187 col 1 -->

the dead thrown rudely from their
last resting place.</p>

<p>The extent of the cellar might not
be ascertained by the uncertain light
of the lanthern. It may have been a
hundred feet in extent, or even two
hundred, but whenever the light
flared up it disclosed some dark recess,
filled with crumbling coffins, or laid
bare some obscure nook, where ghastly
skulls and fragments of the human
skeleton, were thrown together like
old lumber in a storehouse.</p>

<p>Even where the lanthern stood, in
a square, described by four massive
pillars which, arising from the oaken
floor, supported the arching ceiling,
its light gleamed over a skeleton, with
the various bones separated by time,
and the jaw, with its bristling teeth,
falling apart from the blackened skull.</p>

<p>The sound of a footstep rung echoing
among the arches of the cellar
with a hollow sound; and in a moment,
ere the figure of the intruder
might be seen, the murmur of a human
voice mingled with the echo of
the footstep.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! While the broadcloth
gentry of the Quaker City guzzle
their champagne two stories above,
here, in these cozy cellars of Monk-Hall,
old Devil-Bug entertains the
thieves and cut-throats of the town
with scorchin' Jamakey spirits and
raw Monygehaley! Hark how the
fellers laugh and shout in the next
cellar!"</p>

<p>And the chorus of a rude drinking
song, chaunted first by a single voice,
then echoed by a score, came faint
and murmuring through the thick
walls of the adjoining cellar.</p>

<!-- page 187 col 2 -->

<p class="small">"Let the Bank D'rector swill his sham-pane,<br/>

It's pisen'd with orphan's tears&mdash;<br/>

Raw Jamakey we'll drink and drink again,<br/>

For d&mdash;l a beak we fears!"</p>

<p>"That's what I likes&mdash;" said Devil-Bug,
as he came shuffling onward
into the light of the lanthern&mdash;"I
usually wisits my private 'partments
'bout once a day, just to see how the
boys gets on! This place is what I
calls my study he, he, he! The
Pawnbroker in the next street ain't in
partnership with me? There ain't no
secret passage underground from his
shop to my cellars? We don't kontract
to supply so many thieves an'
cut-throats with vittels, lodgin' and
viskey? Them quest'ins is better with
corks on&mdash;it don't do for sich likker to
spill out, I tell you!"</p>

<p>He disappeared for a moment behind
one of the brick pillars, and in
an instant emerged into the light
again, dragging the remnant of a
coffin at his heels.</p>

<p>"The genelman as used to inhabit
this konwenient winter and summer
residence, has soffened into dust. His
coffin 'ill sarve me for a seat. Turn
it over&mdash;that's right&mdash;now let me
think. Hum-hum! Musketer, I say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes massa&mdash;" muttered the voice
of the negro, from a distant part of the
cellar.</p>

<p>"If any one wants to see me, tell
Glow-worm to show 'em down, and&mdash;d'ye
hear, you brute? Do you
show 'em in when they are down.
Devil-Bug's at home for wisiters."</p>

<p>"Yes massa!" muttered the negro,
from the darkness of the cellar; and
then all was silent again.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug was seated upon the
coffin, with his elbows supported by

<!-- page 188 col 1 -->

his knees, and his swarthy cheeks
resting on his thick and heavy fingers.
The full beams of the lanthern glared
in his face, with the matted hair hanging
over the protuberant forehead,
while each hideous feature, the flat
nose with the wing-like nostrils, the
wide mouth with the rows of bristling
teeth, the pointed chin, rough with a
short and stubble-like beard, the eyeless
socket and the solitary eye, all
were disclosed in strong and glaring
light, as the shadow of his figure
was flung like a belt of darkness along
the floor. As he sate there, with his
face agitated, by various expressions,
all mingled with his habitual sneer
and scowl, he looked like the tutelar
Demon of that vault of Death.</p>

<p>"My life's been a purty quiet one,"
he soliloquized. "Not many incidents
to tell; passed my years in the
comfortible retiracy o' domestic fellicity,
as Parson Pyne would say! Yet
there was one advent<i>oo</i>re in my life:
queer one, that. One stormy night,
'bout seventeen year ago, there comes
to Monk-Hall, a rale bully of a feller,
with a purty gal on his arm. He
struck her a blow with his fist: I
knocked him down. Gal liked me
from that hour&mdash;ha, ha, ha&mdash;the
thing makes me smile! A purty gal
in love with a <i>han'some</i> man like Devil-Bug!
And yit, and yit, many's
the night I've laid at her door, a
watchin' her&mdash;and a-keepin' harm
from her, and&mdash;&mdash;ho! ho! ho! She
used to say she loved me 'cause I
didn't deceive my looks! For one
year, me and that gal was man an'
wife! The year passed&mdash;one night
she quit Monk-Hall&mdash;I ain't never
heerd on her since! And, what is a

<!-- page 188 col 2 -->

werry rimarkible circumstance, I
never think o' that gal, without my
heart gettin' soft, and the water comin'
in my eyes! If any other man would
say that o' me, I'd sue him for libel!&mdash;Hallo!
who's there?"</p>

<p>"Monk Baltzar, massa," answered
the voice of Musquito, from a distant
recess of the cellar.</p>

<p>"That's Parson Pyne's slang
name!" muttered Devil-Bug.&mdash;"Show
him in, Musketer!"</p>

<p>And in a moment, there came hurrying
from the darkness which enveloped
the distant portions of the
cellar, the figure of a man wrapped
up in a long and drooping black cloak.</p>

<p>"I say, Abijah, what are you doing
down here?" he muttered in a surly
tone, from the folds of his cloak, as
he approached Devil-Bug's lanthern.
"Very odd taste, this!"</p>

<p>"Draw a cheer, Parson," exclaimed
Devil-Bug, smiling blandly; "or,
now, that I think o' it, there ain't no
cheers. Draw a coffin, Parson, and
let's have a talk!"</p>

<p>"I've no time to stay," muttered
the new-comer, as he allowed the folds
of his cloak to fall from his face, and
discovered the full and beaming visage
of the Rev. Dr. Pyne. "One word,
and I'm gone."</p>

<p>"And that word about the gal
you've been seekin' for three days?"</p>

<p>"At last I've lured her to Monk-Hall!
This morning I discovered her
hiding place; and, notwithstanding
her tears and cries, forced her in a
carriage, quieted her with threats, and
but five minutes since, smuggled her
into Monk-Hall."</p>

<p>"More work for me, I see! What
was the kontract?"</p>

<!-- page 189 col 1 -->

<p>"You were to give her a potion in
her drink, in order&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That she might be prepared for
your wishes?"</p>

<p>"See that it's done, before ten
o'clock to-night, and the hundred dollars
are yours!"</p>

<p>"I say, Brother Pyne," said Devil-Bug,
with a pleasant smile.&mdash;"When
do you preach again? I reely must
come and hear you! Is the old ladies
werry much melted when you gives
it to the sinners?"</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" muttered Brother Pyne,
moving toward the darkness of the
cellar. "You will always have your
joke. Remember, Abijah, the potion
before ten to-night!"</p>

<p>He disappeared in the darkness, and
Devil-Bug was alone, once more.</p>

<p>"Wonder if there's many more sich
parsons in the world? Fine fat-faced
fellers, with round paunches, and
watery eyes? Seems to me, human
natur' is wery much like a piece of
putty in a baby's fingers! The baby
can twist that piece of putty into any
shape he likes, and the more the leetle
crittur twists it, the more twist-able it
becomes! The idee-ar of full grown
human bein's listenin' to a steam ingine
like that, with his mouth belching
out smoke and blazes, all the while!
Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;" he muttered, falling into
the same soliloquizing mood which
had come over his soul, before the entrance
of the Rev. Mr. F. A. T.
Pyne,&mdash;"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;she was a purty
gal, an I sometimes thinks she's a
livin' yit! She never told me nothin'
but her first name, an that's on the
goold bracelet which she gave me.
I've got it&mdash;fast&mdash;fast&mdash;under lock
and key!"</p>

<!-- page 189 col 2 -->

<p>Devil-Bug was silent. The shouts
of the revellers in the adjoining cellar,
grew more loud and uproarious, yet he
heeded them not. Deep in the heart
of this monster, like a withered flower
blooming from the very corruption of
the grave, the memory of that fair
young girl, who, eighteen years ago,
had sought the shelter of Monk-Hall,
lay hidden, fast entwined around the
life-cords of his deformed soul.</p>

<p>Oh, tell us, ye who in the hours of
infancy, have laid upon a mother's
bosom, who have basked in a father's
smile, who have had wealth to bring
you comfort, luxury, and a home, who
have sunned in the light of religion
as you grew toward manhood, and
been warmed into intellectual life by
the blessing of education; Oh, tell us,
ye who with all these gifts and mercies,
flung around you by the hand of
God, have, after all, spurned his laws,
and rotted in your very lives, with the
foul pollution of libertinism and lust;
tell us, who shall find most mercy at
the bar of Avenging Justice&mdash;you,
with your prostituted talents, gathering
round your guilty souls, so many witnesses
of your utter degradation, or
Devil-Bug, the doorkeeper of Monk-Hall,
in all his monstrous deformity
of body and intellect, yet with <i>one</i>
redeeming memory, gleaming like a
star, from the chaos of his sins?</p>

<p>For him there had never been a
church, a Bible, or a God! No ardent
messenger of Jesus had ever
spoken to his ears of the God who
upon the cross, for all men's
sins, and all mankind's salvation.
Never, never!</p>

<p>And in this great city, there are
thousands upon thousands hidden in

<!-- page 190 col 1 -->

the nooks and dens of vice, who, like
Devil-Bug of Monk-Hall, have never
heard that there is a Bible, a Savior,
or a God! True, when dragged before
the bar of Justice (as by a lively
stretch of fancy the mockery
called) for the commission of crimes,
to which the very evils of this most
Christian community had driven them,
hungry and starving as they were,
these wretches have seen that Bible
lifted up in Court, heard that Savior's
name lipped over by some official,
anxious for his dinner, or heard the
name of that God profaned by some
witness, greedy to sell his soul for the
price of a hat! This one point stated,
and you have comprised in a focus,
all their knowledge of a Bible, a Savior,
or a God!</p>

<p>And this, in that great Quaker
City, which every Sunday lifts its
demure face to Heaven, and, with
Church-burning, Girard College, and
Bank-robbery, hanging around its
skirts, tells the Almighty God that it
has sent missionaries to the Isles of
the sea, to the Hindoo, the Turk, and
the Hottentot; that it feels for the
spiritual wants of the far-off nations,
to an extent that cannot be measured
by words, while it has not one single
throb of pity, for the poor, who starve,
rot and die, within its very eye
sight!</p>

<p>"She wos a purty gal, and whenever
I think of her, as I said afore,
my eyes grow watery! I struck the
feller who had laid his hands upon
her&mdash;I struck him to the floor. I
b'lieve my soul she liked me from
that hour! Hullo&mdash;who's there?"</p>

<p>"A little nigga, massa&mdash;" replied

<!-- page 190 col 2 -->

the voice of Musquito, still speaking
from the distant nook of the cellar.</p>

<p>"Fitz-Cowles' niggar!" muttered
Devil-Bug&mdash;"Wonder what he can
be wanting with me?"</p>

<p>"De High Golly!" cried a voice
echoing from the darkness of the
vault&mdash;"Dis de debbil's own den, and
dare's de debbil hisself!"</p>

<p>Dim, the Creole, in his neat blue
round-jacket and trowsers, came stealing
cautiously toward the lanthern.</p>

<p>"You're a purty boy&mdash;ain't you?
What d'ye want down here&mdash;hey?"</p>

<p>"Dare's a lettaw from Massa Fitz-Cowles&mdash;"
observed Dim, approaching
Devil-Bug with a cautious glance&mdash;"De
High Golly! I wonder if dat
ting hab got a tail!"</p>

<p>"Here, young indoovidooal, read
this letter. There wasn't no Free
Schools when I was young. Konsekence
was, my eddycation was neglected."</p>

<p>"And he hab got <i>two</i> feet!" muttered
Dim&mdash;"Bress my soul, I t'ought
one foot was a hoof! Oh, massa, you
can't read dat letter&mdash;may be you kin
read dis ring!"</p>

<p>"Hullo! the ring!" cried Devil-Bug,
with a start&mdash;"I remember
well, that when Fitz-Cowles first rikvested
me to hide the Jew, he told me
to mark this ring. 'Mark it,' ses he,
'and whenever I send this ring to you,
cause the Jew to, <i>retire!</i> Ho, ho,
that's what's in the wind&mdash;is it? Hurry,
Charcoal, an' read that letter!"</p>

<p>Bending slowly over the light, Dim
read the letter which we have already
laid before the reader.</p>

<p>"To think a nigger like that should
read, and my eddycation neglected!
Ten thousand dollars about his person!

<!-- page 191 col 1 -->

Recompense meself for the keer and
trouble I've had with him! Won't I?
You can go, young genelman&mdash;yet
hold up a minnit! Why didn't you
bring this ring and letter sooner than
this? You've been playin' pitch-penny
with some other nigger, I'll be
bound!"</p>

<p>"Ha, yah!" laughed Dim, to himself&mdash;"Dat
mus' be de debbil, sure
'nuf! I say, massa, how did yer
know dat? I jis was doin dat same
t'ing! A party ob us young bloods
went down to see de Navy Yard and
den we tuk a shine roun' town!"</p>

<p>"Re-tire young genelman!" said
Devil-Bug, severely&mdash;"Re-tire and
<i>re</i>-port yesself to head-quarters, forthwith!"</p>

<p>"Ha-yah!" laughed Dim, as he
hurried from the cellar&mdash;"Dis chile
know a little more dan mos' folk! He
seen de debbil&mdash;ha, yah&mdash;once in his
life, anyhow!"</p>

<p>Devil-Bug was alone again. Shifting
the lanthern from its position, he
carefully examined the oaken planks
of the floor. The outlines of a large
trap-door were discernible, with the
bolt, which held it to the floor, inserted
in the worn and rusted socket.</p>

<p>"Trap-door 'bout ten feet square!
There's a well below it&mdash;a deep well,
a dark well; the d&mdash;l knows how
deep! Any individooal gettin' a fall
through that trap-door, might stand in
danger of bein' eat up by rats and all
sorts o' wermin, in case the fall didn't
hurt him! Ten thousand dollars!
Buy a snug little farm out West, or,
ha, ha, ha, if there wos a good tariff
passed by some o' these cussed Congressmen,
Devil-Bug might go into
the iron-works!"</p>

<!-- page 191 col 2 -->

<p>"Massa," exclaimed the voice of
Musquito, from the darkness, "Dat ar
Jew is a-comin' down stairs."</p>

<p>"Let him come," answered Devil-Bug.&mdash;"It
don't cost nothin'. And,
hark ye, the minnit he passes the cellar
door, do you dig off!"</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, Devil-Bug
hastily took the lamp from within the
lanthern, and poured some oil over
the rusted bolt of the trap door. In
an instant the bolt yielded to the impulse
of his hand, and moved quietly
along the socket.</p>

<p>"All right! I'll jist leave the bolt
a-clingin' to the socket, by its end!
The slightest touch from my hand,
won't unloose it? Redikulus! I must
get a cheer for my friend&mdash;'tain't nice
to give a party without cheers!"</p>

<p>Disappearing behind a brick pillar,
he drew the fragment of another coffin,
from its resting place, and laid it
down on the floor, some six feet from
the spot where the lanthern stood.</p>

<p>"Any genelman a-sittin' on that
cheer, will have the hinges o' the trap
door directly at his back, with some six
feet o' the trap a-twixt me and him!
The bolt will be right under my foot,
so it will! Suppose I was to git
thinkin' on some subject, and forgit
myself? My foot might unlodge the
bolt from its socket in the trap door.
K-u-sh-ew-<i>bang!</i>" he continued, producing
a strange hissing sound, by
suddenly forcing his breath through
his clenched teeth. "K-u-sh-ew-<i>bang!</i>
The trap door 'ud fall, and&mdash;'melancholy
to <i>re</i>-late,' as the newspapers
ses&mdash;some body 'ud git their
brains knocked into shad-roe
off!"</p>

<p>"Massa Von Gelt, am here, Massa

<!-- page 192 col 1 -->

'Bijah," cried Musquito, from the distant
extreme of the vault.</p>

<p>"Show the genelman in, and tell
him to walk mighty keerful, or else
he might fall through some o' them
cussed holes, in the floor!"</p>

<p>In a moment, a cautious footstep
was heard, and the dim outline of the
Jew's figure, became visible, as he advanced
along the vault.</p>

<p>"Goot eveningsh!" was his salutation,
as he approached the lanthern&mdash;"Fader
Abraham! vot you dosh in
dis place?"</p>

<p>"Good arternoon&mdash;" exclaimed
Devil-Bug grinning hideously&mdash;"Sit
down, an' take a cheer!"</p>

<p>With a slight shrug of disgust, the
hump-back, seated himself upon the
coffin opposite Devil-Bug, and quietly
folding his arms over his fragment of
a body, gazed fixedly into the hideous
face of the Doorkeeper.</p>

<p>"I say old feller, will you smoke?"
exclaimed Devil-Bug, taking some segars
from the breast of his coarse outer
garment, which neither frock coat,
overcoat nor dress coat, was fashioned
of dingy canvass, with great horn
buttons, running up in front, while the
wide sleeves, hung loosely round his
muscular arms&mdash;"I say old feller will
you smoke? Here's yer reg'lar Pax'on
cannon smokers&mdash;" and he displayed
a number of segars in the bony palm
of his broad hand&mdash;"or here's yer
baby-suckers wot ain't got no strength
in them at all. Take a smoke, Gabr'el?"</p>

<p>"I vill take won baby-sucker, wot
ish not doo sthrong&mdash;" replied Gabriel
as reaching forth his hands, he seemed
about advancing toward Devil-Bug
"Dis plashe is very dampish&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Beg you won't take the trouble to

<!-- page 192 col 2 -->

git up&mdash;" exclaimed Devil-Bug as
hastily rising he removed the lanthern,
from its location at his feet, to the immediate
vicinity of the Jew&mdash;"Jist
keep the lanthern there. I likes to
<i>kon</i>-template beauty, in a strong
light!"</p>

<p>The two figures, would have made an
effective picture. The lanthern placed
at the feet of the Jew, threw a strong
light over his person, while the form of
Devil-Bug, was wrapt in a sort of
lively twilight. The calm visage of the
Jew, rendered even more quiet and
contemplative by the segar which he
smoked, the unnatural length of his
face, and the absurd disproportion of
his small and hump-backed body,
which looked more like a shapeless
lump, dressed up in man's attire, than
the frame of a human being, all presented
a vivid contrast to the visage of
Devil-Bug, its solitary eye, glaring
through the obscurity of the vault, like a
flame coal, while his short, but stout and
muscular frame, with the heavy body,
knotted into uncouth knobs at the
shoulders, with the long arms and
bony fists, the slim legs and massive
feet, all gave you the idea, of a
Sampson, stunted in his growth; a
giant whom nature had dwarfed from
the regular proportion of manly beauty,
down into an uncouth image of
hideous strength.</p>

<p>Around the twain, extended the
death-vault of Monk-Hall, its distant
recesses, wrapt in heavy shadow,
while the arched ceiling directly overhead,
the oaken floor around, and the
four pillars of massive brick, were
now disclosed in strong light, as a
sudden gust of wind, agitated the lanthern-flame,
or yet again veiled in a

<!-- page 193 col 1 -->

dim shadow, which gave a dark and
dreary appearance to the place.</p>

<p>"I say Gabr'el, wot a pitty, it is;
isn't it?" exclaimed Devil-Bug, as he
looked forth from the cloud of tobacco-smoke,
which half-concealed his hideous
countenance.</p>

<p>"Vot ish a bitty?"</p>

<p>"That me and you, wasn't jined
together, with a cord, a-passin'
through our witals! Wouldn't we
have made a specymen of Siamese
twins! Ho, ho! What a pair of
beauties!"</p>

<p>"What wos dish plashe made fur?"
asked Gabriel knocking the ashes from
his segar&mdash;"It looksh like won devil's
counting-housh, Bi-Gott!"</p>

<p>"Why, ye see, Gabr'el&mdash;" said
Devil-Bug in a cheerful way&mdash;"From
all that I ever heered, them fellers as
used to hold out in these diggins, the
Monkses and Priestses, and Nunses,
in the time of the Revvylushun, made
a practice o' buryin their dead in
this 'ere cellar; and a lively practice
it was too! They do say there was
fine goin's-on in the old times, in these
parts! I ought to 've been about in
those days! I was born arter my time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Vas you porn at all?" enquired
Gabriel with a look of quiet sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Now d'ye know, Gabr'el, that I
sometimes think, I was never born at
all? very pecooliar that you should
jist think as I do, on that pint. Suppose
I was a devil, wouldn't it be a
lively thing for me, to chaw you up,
without pepper or salt! Lord! How
I should like to gouge out one of
your eyes! Ha, ha! 'Nother segar,
Gabr'el?"</p>

<p>"I wash to see Vitz-Cowle dis
morningsh&mdash;" exclaimed Gabriel, with

<!-- page 193 col 2 -->

a calm decision of manner, that indicated
the man of business.</p>

<p>"You wos, wos ye?" answered
Devil-Bug, playing carelessly with the
bolt of the trap-door&mdash;"And arter
you'd seen him, what happened?"</p>

<p>"You knowsh de Widow Smolpy?
She has de goldt plate, and de monish!"</p>

<p>"Know <i>her?</i>" cried Devil-Bug, still
playing with the bolt&mdash;"The old woman's
as rich as Geerard! You wos
to see her, wos you, Gabr'el?"</p>

<p>"I vos, and soldt her a goldt watch.
Dat ish to say, I made her a presentsh
ov de watch&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do I look like a werry young infant?"
exclaimed Devil-Bug, as bending
his face down between his knees,
he passed his fingers along the floor,
with a quick movement&mdash;"A Jew
give anybody a watch! I'll go an'
jine the Free Repenters arter that!"</p>

<p>"Vot you scratch your fingersh on
te floor? Hey? I doesh not like dat
noise! I am so nervous! I gives te
watch to her, but I takes five thousandt
dollars in goldt, from the house,
for my watch!"</p>

<p>"Five thousand dollars in gold,
where is it, Gabr'el, where is it?"</p>

<p>"Up stairsh, in your room. I
put it in te closetsh, near te firesh.
Vot you scratch your fingers on te
floor?"</p>

<p>"Gabr'el, are you good at 'rithmetic?
How much is five thousand dollars
and ten thousand dollars?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen tousandt tollars. Vot you
asksh for?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;" replied Devil-Bug, as
with his face still bent down between
his knees, he played with the bolt of
the trap-door&mdash;"Why&mdash;why&mdash;in fact,
Gabr'el, you can <i>re</i>-tire!"</p>

<!-- page 194 col 1 -->

<p>The word had not passed his lips
before the bolt flew back from its
socket; there was a creaking noise, succeeded
by a crash&mdash;and the whirring
sound produced by the falling trap
door, echoed around the death-vault.
Devil-Bug listened. All was darkness
and silence. With the last gleam of
light he had beheld the Jew tottering
on the brink of the chasm, and now
he listened for the sound produced by
the mangled body, as it went sweeping
through the air, to the bottom of
the well. Another moment passed.
A sound arose from the depths of the
well. It was the sound of the lanthern
as it struck against the sides of the
chasm. Bending over the well, on
hands and knees, Devil-Bug listened
with an intensity that forced the cold
sweat out from his forehead. No
sound came echoing up the chasm,
not even a murmur or a groan.</p>

<p>"He's gone home to his daddy&mdash;"
muttered Devil-Bug, as rising on his
feet again, he turned, in the darkness,
from the edge of the trap door&mdash;
"He'll never refuse fat pork agin,
I warrant ye!"</p>

<p>"I say, vot te teffil you cuts dem
capersh for?" said a clear bold voice,
resounding through the darkness of
the vault&mdash;"Got-tam! I might have
fell town and hurtsh mesself! Vot
for you actsh like a crashy man?"</p>

<p>Devil-Bug started. So certain had
he been of the Jew's death, that when
he heard his voice echoing through
the darkness, it struck him with a
feeling of supernatural awe. In a
moment, however, he recovered himself
and began to crawl around the
edge of the trap-door, in the direction
from whence the voice had issued.</p>

<!-- page 194 col 2 -->

<p>"He got off, did he?" he muttered
to himself "Ha! I won't seize him
by the throat, and pitch him into the
well? Jist trust me with him, a minnit,
somebody!&mdash;Why you see, Gabr'el,"
he added aloud, in his blandest
tone&mdash;"I happened to put my foot on
the bolt o' that cussed hatchway and
it come loose! Where are you, Gabr'el?
I'm got somethin pertickter
to say to you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No toudt, no toudt," responded
Gabriel&mdash;"Put I vill keepsh my dishtance!
Fader Abraham! vot a man
it ish!"</p>

<p>Creeping along the floor, on hands
and feet, Devil-Bug approached the
pillar from whence the voice proceeded.</p>

<p>"To sarve me sich a trick!" he
muttered&mdash;"But I'll bruise him for it,
I'll bruise him!"</p>

<p>"I vos a-goin' to tellsh you dat
I drop mine pocketsh-book in de woman
Smolpy's house. Ten tousandt
tollars in it, too!"</p>

<p>"What's that you say?" grunted
Devil-Bug&mdash;"Dropped your pocket-book
in widow Smolby's house? You
are a precious pork-hater, to give ten
thousand dollars for five!"</p>

<p>A shrill whistle echoed round the
vault, ringing through nook and crevice,
with a piercing sound, like the
winter wind shrieking down a chimney.</p>

<p>"What are ye up to?" growled
Devil-Bug, as his outspread hands
grasped the brick pillar&mdash;"Jist let me
have a feel of your hand, Gabr'el&mdash;"</p>

<p>As he spoke the glare of a lamp
flashed over the vault. Devil-Bug
beheld the face of the Jew thrust from
the opposite side of the pillar, with the

<!-- page 195 col 1 -->

keen and piercing eyes fixed upon his
countenance.</p>

<p>"Where did that light come from?"
he shouted&mdash;"Hey, Gabr'el?"</p>

<p>Turning suddenly, he beheld the
form of a stranger, advancing from the
distant door of the vault with a lighted
candle in his hand.</p>

<p>"I vos jist a-goin' to tell you&mdash;"
exclaimed Gabriel, as Devil-Bug was
occupied in watching the stranger,
who came hastening over the floor of
the vault&mdash;"Tat we can rop te widow
Smolpy's house. Dosh dat pleash
you? I can git into te house tish
very afternoon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now mister, may I axe, who <i>you</i>
are, and what the d&mdash;l you want
here?" cried Devil-Bug, as the new-comer,
light in hand, stood in front
of the pillar which separated the
Doorkeeper from the Jew&mdash;"What's
yer name, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Brick-Top," responded the stranger
in a snuffling voice, "Brick-Top, at
your service, sir. My daddy was a
scavenger, and my mammy sold rags.
Now you know all about me, and my
family into the bargain. How d'ye
feel, old cove?"</p>

<p>"You're werry familiar, young
man; you are!" exclaimed Devil-Bug
as he gazed upon the new-comer, with
a suspicious glance.</p>

<p>Brick-Top, was a tall, thin person
age, clad from head to foot in rags;
not ragged clothes, nor damaged
clothes, nor shabby genteel clothes;
but absolute and unconditional rags.
His thin face, with its aquiline nose,
was spotted all over with large freckles,
and a great bunch of fiery red
hair hung over his forehead, down to
the very eyes. The lower part of his

<!-- page 195 col 2 -->

face was hedged in by a thick beard,
of the same fiery red as his matted
hair; while his eyes, keen, dark, and
brilliant, presented a strange contrast
to the vacant and unmeaning expression
of his freckled countenance.</p>

<p>"Yer daddy was a scavenger, and
yer mammy sold rags? It's my opinion,
young man, that yer mammy
must a-dressed you up in her rag shop,
and that yer daddy got mad with you
won day, and cleaned some werry
dirty alley with yer carcase! Wot a
jail bird! It <i>must</i> a-been a dirty
alley, anyhow! Who is the chap,
hey, Gabr'el?"</p>

<p>"A person I got dis mornin' to help
us to rob te Widow Smolby's house.
He can git into te house, easy as
nothinsh! Dish young man vill help!"</p>

<p>"The Widow Smolby's house?"
exclaimed Devil-Bug. "Stores o'
plate, chests o' yaller boys, closets
full o' walleyables? We kin git into
the house easy as nothin', kin we?
That 'ud be a haul; the Widder Smolby's
jewelry! Why didn't ye say
this at fust, Gabr'el? I wouldn't a-played
any jokes on you then: no
more I wouldn't!"</p>

<p>"Tem jokes ish very tampdt' fat,"
said Gabriel quietly; he little dreamed
that this pleasant joke had been
prepared by Fitz-Cowles, for his especial
benefit.</p>

<p>"Vot a set o' wretches ye are!"
exclaimed Brick-top, snuffing the candle
with his fingers&mdash;"To stand here
gabblin' about nothin', ven the old
Widdey's house is a-waitin' to be robbed.
Didn't that servant wots a-goin'
to betray her Missus, tell us to be on
hand afore three in the arternoon!"</p>

<p>"So we kin git in that way, kin

<!-- page 196 col 1 -->

we?" exclaimed Devil-Bug, with his
accustomed delightful chuckle; "Come
along, Pork-hater, come along, Bundle
o' Rags; this is <i>kon</i>-siderable better
than 'Nited States Bank stock!"</p>

<p>And the three pleasant companions
hastened from the Death-vault of
Monk-Hall; Devil-Bug and Gabriel
Von Gelt, conversing together in subdued
tones while, Brick-Top, following
at their heels, manifested his exuberance
of spirit, by various strange
gestures and mysterious expressions.</p>

<p>"Can we trust that 'are loafer?
Werry low feller, he is!" exclaimed
Devil-Bug in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Very desperit fellersh!" replied
Gabriel. "Toes not care for tanger,
and ish goot mit a knifesh!"</p>

<p>"Hurray for Tippeycanoe!" shouted
Brick-Top, cutting a caper in the
air; "the lots o' gold and walleyables
we're a-goin' to lay hold of! All in
the arternoon, ven the Quaker City
'as had its dinner, and all the Aldermen
is a-strugglin' with boat loads o'

<p>"NOW, Peggy Grud, did I ketch
ye, that time? Fill the hopper to the
brim with coffee, that cost me nine
cents a pound! Hey! hey! Here's
waste for you&mdash;here's comin' to want
in my old age! Sit down, Ike, near
the fire, Ike don't mind that woman,
Peggy Grud! <i>She</i> can't help it, if
she's crazy! Here, Wessy, here

<!-- page 196 col 2 -->

Nappy, Washy, Washy, I say come
an' sit near the fire, my dears! You
Peggy Grud, where did ye put Abe, I
say?"</p>

<p>"Murder mur-<i>der!</i>" cried a shrill
voice from the cage, above the mantel.</p>

<p>"Oh, yer there, are ye? Why
jist look at that, Peggy Grud, the
werry parrot cries out, 'Murder!'
when he sees you wastin' the coffee
in that style. Now, <i>what did</i> possess
you, Peggy Grud, to fill that hopper
brimfull with that roast coffee, which
cost me nine cents a pound?"</p>

<p>"Troth, Missus Smolby, an its
yerself that's hard to the poor! Did
the divvil himself ever hear tell o' the
likes o' this? A hopper full o' nine
cent coffee ind<i>aa</i>de! D'ye think me

blood o' turpentine an' melasses, that

<p>"Don't shake yer coffee mill under
my nose! It cost nine cents a pound."</p>

<p>"Murder, mur-<i>der!</i>" screamed the
parrot.</p>

<p>"Troth the parrot's a-laffin' at ye!
No wondher! Didn't he, himself,
wid his own eyes, see me the t'other
day, a-tryin' to make some o' this
coffee run down the kitchen stairs&mdash;and
all I could do, it wouldn't for the
life o' me, stir a step! mair be, token
it was very wake!"</p>

<p>"Git out o' my sight, Peggy Grud,
git out o' my sight, and don't come
near me to-day agin!"</p>

<p>"Ochone! We're got our dander
riz, have we?" cried Peggy Grud,
bouncing out of the room. "It's
mighty crazy we're a-gettin' in our
old age," she shrieked, from the entry
without the door. "An' it 'ud take a

<!-- page 197 col 1 -->

dozen divvils to manage us, it would!"
she added, by way of a parting salute,
as she was heard descending the
stairs.</p>

<p>"It's about seventeen years this
day!" muttered the old woman, quietly
seating herself in the capacious arm
chair, placed in front of the fire-place.
"Seventeen years since <i>she</i> died&mdash;seventeen
years since I have had a
fire made in this room! Hum-hum!
So Brother Pyne was that gal's father!
The trollop, to run away from her
own father's house! Howsomever,
he tuk her home agin, this mornin'!
Wonder if Luke won't swear when
he hears it? To think I should outlive
five husbands, Buddy, and Crank,
and Dul&mdash;Dul&mdash;Peg, I say, what was
my third husband's name? Oh, she
ain't here. Dulcombe&mdash;or Dulman,
or, yes that's it, Dulpins, and&mdash;&mdash;
what was I a-goin' to say?"</p>

<p>The old lady glanced around the
room, with a puzzled look. The
Ghost-Room was perfectly still and
quiet. The faint wood fire, flickering
over the hearth, every now and then,
flared up in a sudden flash, dispelling
the dim shadows which rested upon
the corners of the chamber. As the
fire died away, the light of the solitary
candle, standing upon the work
table, at the old lady's side, fell with
glaring lustre, around its immediate
vicinity, while the farther extremes of
the room were wrapt in dusky shadow.
The massive bed, with its
heavy curtains, rose in the obscure
air, like a mausoleum for the dead; the
circular mirror, standing on the antique
dressing bureau, as ever and
anon, it received a gleam of light on
its polished surface, looked like one

<!-- page 197 col 2 -->

of those mirrors, in which you are
afraid to gaze, when alone in the silence
of night, for fear a ghostly face
may peer over your shoulder in the
glass; and the thick hangings depending
from the windows, waved
slowly to and fro, as occasional gusts
of wind came moaning through the
crevices of the chamber door.</p>

<p>The picture above the mantel, as
the light trembled over its surface, assumed
the appearance of reality, and
for a moment, ever and anon, it would
seem animate with a sudden life. The
deep, lustrous dark eyes, the pale face,
blooming with a rose-bud freshness in
the centre of either cheek, and strikingly
relieved by the long black hair,
twining around the neck, and falling
over the bosom in glossy curls, seemed
warming into life, while it gazed with
a sad and melancholy gaze, upon the
wrinkled visage of the old woman
seated by the fireside.</p>

<p>"Murder&mdash;mur-der!" screamed the
parrot, from his cage, which was hung
beside the portrait. "Murder&mdash;Fi-er!"</p>

<p>"Now, Abe," cried the Widow
Smolby, starting from her reverie,&mdash;"That's
a lie! I was not a-goin' to
say murder nor fi-er! But I was
a-goin' to say that it was a strange
thing that I should outlive five husbands,
Buddy, and Crank, and Smolby,
and Tuppick, an one whose name
I dis-remember; and be robbed, arter
all, by a plunderin' Jew; not at all
mentionin' Peggy Grud's filling the
hopper brimfull o' nine cent coffee!"</p>

<p>The old lady gazed fondly into the
faces of her four cats, grouped around
the fire-place, like pieces of Dutch
statuary, as though she awaited their
answer to her lamentations.</p>

<!-- page 198 col 1 -->

<p>"Ike-y" she exclaimed, gazing in
the countenance of a very vicious tortoise-shelled
cat,&mdash;"You wos very
naughty to <i>per</i>-voke that Abe this
mornin'! You was so! Wesley,
that's a good Wesley," and she patted
the back of a cat, whose coat displayed
an uniform of sky-blue and white.
"To sit cardin' wool there all alone,
by yerself! Washy didn't ketch any
mice to-day." This was addressed
in a tone of mock severity, to a large
and lubberly white cat. "And, as
for you, Nappy,"&mdash;Nappy was a
small black cat, with spiteful green
eyes&mdash;"And, as for you, Nappy, you
don't do nothin' but spin from mornin'
till night!"</p>

<p>Attracted by the sound of the old
woman's voice, the four cats, arose
from their sleeping postures, and began
to rub their sleek fur against her
dress, while they exhibited their delight
by purring to a lively tune.</p>

<p>"Ikey spins werry coarse&mdash;" soliloquized
the old woman&mdash;"I feel very
heavy, now that I come to think of it.
I b'lieve I'll lay down a bit."</p>

<p>She moved toward the bed, with the
cats following at her heels, and in a moment
disappeared within the curtains.</p>

<p>"I've never laid in this bed&mdash;" her
voice resounded from within the hangings&mdash;"Since
the day afore she died!
Be still Ike&mdash;don't stick yer claws into
me, in that way! Down Wesley, I
say get off my head&mdash;Wesley how
dare you! Tear my cap to pieces in
that way! Nappy, ye black snake
ye, will you be quiet?"</p>

<p>"Abe wants a pe-ta-ter!" screamed
the Parrot bustling about in his cage&mdash;"Abe
wants a hot pe-ta-ter! Fi-er!
Murder, Mur-<i>der!</i>"</p>

<!-- page 198 col 2 -->

<p>"I'll get up and choke you, Abe!
I will!" screamed the old woman turning
over in bed&mdash;"Yer a perfec' pack
o' wretches! To think that I should
outlive five husbands, Buddy, Crank,
Dul&mdash;Dul&mdash;I say Peg what's that
one's name? Dul&mdash;Dul&mdash;"</p>

<p>The old lady was asleep. The parrot
in a fit of violent misanthropy
laid his head between his wings and
muffled himself up in those very wings,
like a traveller in his cloak. The room
was perfectly quiet; the silence unbroken
by a sound save the purring
noise made by the cats, as they clustered
round the sleeping widow.</p>

<p>This entire quietude continued for
the space of ten minutes or more,
when it was disturbed by the opening
of the chamber-door.</p>

<p>The withered face of Peggy Grud
was thrust through the aperture.</p>

<p>"Aslaape, is she? An' cut me aff
wid a shillin'? The likes on her to
thry that game wid me, a'ter my long
sarvice! Wait till three o'clock,
comes; jest wait!"</p>

<p>Closing the door, Peggy hurried
down the dark stairway. Instead of
making her way to the basement
kitchen, her usual resort, she entered
the front room on the first floor, and
sate down by the table, on which a
light was burning.</p>

<p>"The laud'num in the coffee, settled
her hash!" she muttered squaring her
elbows, as her withered face, was
wrinkled by a sickly smile&mdash;"The
front door ain't on the jar? Divvil the
taste! I'll jist cr<i>aa</i>pe down to my
karner be the kitchen fire! Five
hunder' dollars the Jew promished;
and two hunder' he's give me, alreadhy!

<!-- page 199 col 1 -->

Faix I'll put 'em in the Loan
Company!"</p>

<p>Peggy rose from her seat, and
moved toward the door of the room.</p>

<p>"Troth it plashes me! Cut me a-ff
wid a shillin' indaade!" she exclaimed
as she closed the door and disappeared&mdash;"Faix
she may be cut a-ff wid
something besides a shillin'; sorrow to
her sowl!"</p>

<p>The room was not long left to silence
and solitude. Peggy had not
disappeared more than five minutes,
when the front door of the mansion,
creaked harshly on its rusty hinges,
footsteps were heard in the entry, and
the door leading from the entry
into the front room, swung slowly open.</p>

<p>"Dish is de plashe!" exclaimed a
voice in a deep whisper, and the diminutive
form of a hump-backed man,
clad in a threadbare cloak, with an
immense white hat concealing his face
from view, strode softly into the room&mdash;"Dish
is de plashe! Now for mine
pockets-booksh, vich&mdash;" he added in a
tone of quiet glee&mdash;"Vich I nefer did
lost!"</p>

<p>Ere another moment passed, two
other figures, wrapped in threadbare
cloaks, like the first, stole cautiously
into the room, and approached the
light, which burned dimly on the small
table in the centre.</p>

<p>"I say Gabr'el bolt the door&mdash;"
said the stoutest figure of the three&mdash;"Let's
have a quiet time to ourselves!
Ho! Ho! Ho! Robbin' a house in
broad daylight! It tickles me, it does!
Now genelmen to your posts&mdash;two on
us must go up stairs, while the t'other
one, watches below. Will you watch
in this 'ere room Gabr'el?"</p>

<p>"Fader Abraham! Viles you has

<!-- page 199 col 2 -->

te priviliges of looking over te oldt
lady's cash-pooks up stairsh! Not I,
py no meansh!"</p>

<p>"What d'ye say Brick-Top? Will
ye keep watch down stairs?"</p>

<p>"Jist as this 'ere convention of the
Sovreign People, may decide&mdash;" replied
the gentleman addressed, quietly
taking his seat by the table&mdash;"But
fair play ye mind? 'I'm to have my
thirds out o' this estate' as the Irish
widder said, when she fit with fourteen
children for thirteen potatoes, and a
salt mackerel! Go up stairs boys, and
Remove the Deposits! We're the rale
Dimmycrats&mdash;we are!"</p>

<p>"Gabr'el they're a-waitin' prayer
for us!" exclaimed Devil-Bug, as his
solitary eye, twinkled from beneath
the shadow of his ponderous hat&mdash;"Up
stairs Gabr'el, up stairs and jine
in prayer for the health o' the old
lady&mdash;"</p>

<p>They hastened from the room, and
in a moment were heard ascending
the stairs, while their companion, the
contemplative Brick-Top, remained
seated beside the table in the front
room.</p>

<p>"This is lively! They go up stairs;
they commence rummaging the front
room. Meanwhile, there is no one on
the look out for them? Oh, no: don't
think of such a thing. Having plundered
the front room, on the third
story, they try the back room door,
and find it locked. This excites their
curiosity. They break open the door,
and&mdash;<i>find themselves in the arms of
Easy Larkspur and twelve police
officers!</i>"</p>

<p>It was singular to note the change
which came over Brick-Top's voice
and manner, as he sate by the table

<!-- page 200 col 1 -->

muttering mysterious words to himself,
in a tone of quiet satisfaction.
His voice, suddenly lost all its vagabond-hoarseness,
and his manner was
utterly unlike the manner of the devil-may-care
loafer, whom Devil-Bug and
Von Gelt had left in the front room
as their sentinel.</p>

<p>Suddenly rising from his seat,
Brick-Top turned his face from the
light, as he bent over a small wash-stand
in an obscure corner of the
room. It was very singular that a
gentleman of his free-and-easy habits
should take the trouble to wash his
face, but judging from the gestures of
Brick-Top, as he stood with his back
to the light, he was certainly occupied
in this vital act of Turkish devotion.</p>

<p>In a moment he turned toward the
light again, and as a farmer strips a
stalk of corn of all superfluous leaves,
so Brick-Top, passing his hands
rapidly up and down his person,
stripped his costume of manifold rags,
entirely from his tall figure, and lo!
he stood disclosed in the beams of
the candle, a very respectable gentleman,
attired in a frock coat and pants
of glossy broadcloth. His uncouth
red hair, hanging over his very eyes,
still gave him a most villainous air of
decayed loaferism, but this he treated
with the same disrespect as his costume
of rags.</p>

<p>"Faugh! How that red wig
stinks!" cried Brick-Top, flinging
his head of hair to the other side of
the room&mdash;"I flatter myself I did the
'loafer' rather genteely! Ha, ha,
Luke, it wasn't so bad for you! 'My
name is Brick-Top, gemmen, my
daddy wos a scavenger, and my
mommy sold rags!' Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<!-- page 200 col 2 -->

<p>Luke Harvey, dressed in his usual
costume, with the paint and freckles
washed from his face, stood disclosed
in the light.</p>

<p>"Dressed myself in a small rag-shop
this morning and prowled about
the avenues leading to Monk-Hall.
Met the Jew&mdash;introduced myself as a
ruffian out of business&mdash;closed the
bargain with him to help rob this
house. Went to the Police office, engaged
twelve fellows with red noses
and agreeable complexions. Gave
their leader, Easy Larkspur, the passkey
to the small door at the back of
this house, which opens into the private
staircase, leading up into the back
room on the third story! The old
lady sleeps there in the afternoon.
The police were to warn her of her
danger. And the old lady and the
girl, I suppose, are safe in the garret,
while Devil-Bug and Von Gelt are
being trapped in the midst of their
plunder. At all events, the police
are close at hand! They are there
at this moment waiting for their prey!
Ha! Let me listen!"</p>

<p>Advancing to the foot of the stairs,
he listened with silent intensity for a
single moment. Not a sound came
echoing down the dark staircase. All
was silent as though no robber's foot
pressed the floors of the old mansion.</p>

<p>"Let me once have the Jew in my
power, and then Fitz-Cowles is a
doomed man! Was not that a shriek?
I will buy the documents by offering
the Jew his liberty and all his share
of the ill-gotten money into the bargain!
Ha! the police are upon
them! I hear them fighting up
stairs! As for Devil-Bug, it rather
pains me to bring the old fellow to

<!-- page 201 col 1 -->

harm's door! Egad, but they're at
it up stairs! No doubt he has committed
crimes enough to sink a ship,
even if each separate crime weighed
no more than a pebble on the seashore!
But he's an honest old rogue
for all that, and the Oath of our
Club prevented me from betraying
the haunts of Monk-Hall to the police,
so I had to lure the Jew from its cozy
old nooks and cells! Pity that Devil-Bug
came with him! Ha! Was not
that a shriek? Another shriek&mdash;a
groan&mdash;and the tramp of footsteps!
Devil-Bug fights hard! He is scuffling
with the police&mdash;I'll hurry up
stairs and see the fun!</p>

<p>A piercing shriek, followed by a
deep-toned shout, echoed through the
chambers of the old mansion. Luke
rushed up stairs. The noise grew
louder in the third story, the hurried
tramp of footsteps resounded through
the mansion, and then all was silent
again. Luke gained the head of the
stairway; all was dark as the tomb.
No light glaring from an open door
served to illumine his way. Standing
at the head of the topmost stair,
Luke held his very breath as he
listened. A dark fear and a horrible
suspicion flashed over his soul. Not
a sound struck his ear, not even the
breathing of a man, or the rustling of
a passing footstep.</p>

<p>"This is strange&mdash;" muttered Luke&mdash;"but
a moment ago the house
rung with shouts and shrieks, and
<i>now</i>&mdash;Ha! This must be the door of
the Ghost-Room&mdash;"</p>

<p>He entered the dark chamber, his
hands outspread, while he listened
with painful intensity for the slightest
sound. He passed over the carpet, he

<!-- page 201 col 2 -->

was moving in the direction where
he supposed the bed was fixed, when
his foot slipped from under him, and
he fell to the floor.</p>

<p>"The floor is wet&mdash;" he muttered,
with an oath, as he endeavored to
regain the floor&mdash;"Curse the thing,
who has been flinging the furniture
about the room?" he continued, as an
object&mdash;a piece of furniture, or perhaps
a chest, or a bundle of clothes&mdash;arrested
his progress and flung him headlong
to the carpet. "The police must
have had a d&mdash;l of a scuffle! But
what's become of the old woman and
the girl?"</p>

<p>Arising hastily to his feet, he rushed
down stairs, in order to procure a
light. Entering the front room once
more, he extended his hands to grasp
the candlestick, and in the very action
started back with a feeling of horror,
that chilled him to the inmost heart.</p>

<p>His hands, which he raised in the
glare of the light, were crimsoned
with thick red blood.</p>

<p class="small">DEVIL-BUG IN THE GHOST-ROOM.</p>

</div>

<p>"CUSS the stairs&mdash;they creak as if
they had the roomatiz! Keep close
to my heels, Gabriel!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I dosh!" whispered the
Jew, in reply&mdash;"There ish a light&mdash;take
keer now, take very goot keer&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ascending the dark staircase with
a hushed and cautious footstep. Devil-Bug
stood on the landing which gave
entrance to the back and front rooms
of the third story. A ruddy gleam

<!-- page 202 col 1 -->

of light flared out upon the passage,
from within the Ghost-Room, as the
door hung slightly ajar. Devil-Bug
advanced a step and listened. All
was silent. He pushed the door wide
open, and with Gabriel following at
his heels, stood within the confines of
the ancient chamber. The candle
was still burning upon the table, and
the wood fire flickered fitfully on the
hearth.</p>

<p>"The old woman's a-sleepin' on that
bed" muttered Devil-Bug "She
snores like a trumpet! We must be
keerful! Have you got the keys&mdash;them
false keys&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Vich I took from wax impressions,
preparedt by Peggy Grud?
Here tey ish&mdash;te trunksh under te
foots of the te bedt&mdash;"</p>

<p>Devil-Bug took the keys in one
hand, the candle in the other and advanced
to the foot of the bed. In a
moment, placing the candle upon the
carpet, he swept the bed-hangings
aside, and drew from under the couch,
with a slow and careful movement, a
small chest of dark wood, with a key
hole of peculiar shape.</p>

<p>"Bi-Gott!" cried the Hebrew, who
ever made use of this favorite oath
when very much excited&mdash;"I smellsh
te gooldt already!"</p>

<p>"H-u-sh!" whispered Devil-Bug,
fixing one of the keys, which he
grasped in his hand, in the keyhole
of the chest&mdash;"Be still, or I'll damage
you so the d&mdash;l won't know you!
Ha, ha there's the yeller boys! The
rale giniwine mulatters!"</p>

<p>"Fader Abraham!" cried the Jew,
rubbing his hands with glee.</p>

<p>With the light extended in one
hand, Devil-Bug, bent slowly down,

<!-- page 202 col 2 -->

and as his every feature was thrown
out in strong relief, he surveyed the
prospect disclosed by the opened chest,
with a glance of the deepest satisfaction.
By his side, knelt the Jew, his
dark eyes sparkling with delight, as
he gazed upon the treasures of the
opened chest. The light flared over
their faces, and over the rich stores of
coin, which peeped out from among
musty parchments, and dingy rolls of
time-eaten manuscript. The long face
of the Jew, with its regularity of feature,
its healthy hues, and its deep and
brilliant eyes, was in vivid contrast
with the hideous countenance of his
companion, the eyeless socket and the
solitary blazing eye, the wide mouth
and the pointed chin, yet in that moment
of intense gratification, their
visages, so widely different in detail,
were glowing with the same grinning
expression of delight, and agitated by
the same grasping lust for gold.</p>

<p>"Gott! Toubloonsh! Toubloonsh!"
muttered the Jew, thrusting his hands
eagerly into the chest.</p>

<p>"Are ye a nateral born fool?" muttered
Devil-Bug in a surly tone&mdash;"The
clink of the pewter 'ill wake up the
old woman. Be quiet while I konsiders
the pecooliar circumstances, under
which we are placed&mdash;"</p>

<p>And as they bent lowly over the
chest, their eyes feasting on the rich
store of doubloons, the bed hangings,
were agitated by a slight movement,
and in an instant, a worn and withered
face, whose sharp features, were
rendered painfully distinct, by the
tight-fitting cap of black silk, was
thrust between the purple folds, within
striking distance of the robbers
heads.</p>

<!-- page 203 col 1 -->

<p>It was the face of the old woman,
aroused from her sleep, by the clinking
of her gold. With presence of
mind, that would have done honor to
a General in a battle-field, she noticed
the movements of the robbers, without
so much as a start or a cry of surprise,
and in that instant of silent observation,
she resolved upon her plan of action.
Beneath the side of the bed, nearest
the wall, was a small chest, in which
a pair of pistols, had been always
kept by her last husband. Could she,
slowly drag her form along the massive
couch, to the opposite side of the
bed, and extending her hands, raise
the lid of the chest, and seize the pistols,
she had no fears for the result.
While the robbers bent over the chest,
whispering to one another in hushed
tones, she withdrew within the curtains,
and commenced dragging herself,
slowly and cautiously along the bed.</p>

<p>"I tells you vat it ish&mdash;" whispered
the Jew&mdash;"Dish is too mosh
monish to take away leetle by leetle!
Somepody may come, and take it
afore we come agin. Let ush, put
down the lid, and carry off te chest at
wonsh!"</p>

<p>"Was that the old 'oman moanin' in
her sleep?" whispered Devil-Bug,
holding his breath to listen&mdash;"Hush!
The bed's a-creakin' like blazes. Let
me go round an' take a look at the old
lady&mdash;"</p>

<p>Arising from the chest, he strode
cautiously around the bed, and gazed
within the curtains. All was dark as
midnight. He could hear a sound like
the hissing of an enraged cat, mingled
with a slight creaking noise.</p>

<p>"The light Gabr'el!" he whispered.</p>

<p>"I'll give it to you, you ornery

<!-- page 203 col 2 -->

scoundr'l to rob a poor live woman,
in this 'ere vay&mdash;" screamed a woman's
voice, from within the curtains,
and the light of a pistol, caused by the
powder flashing in the pan, flared
up in Devil-Bug's face. By that
momentary gleam of light, he beheld
the form of the old woman, crouching
on the bed, in the attitude of an enraged
tigress preparing to spring, a
pistol extended in each outstretched
hand, while a gleam of superhuman
malignity shot from her small grey
eyes.</p>

<p>"Rob a poor lone woman, will ye?
Take that!" she cried, pulling the trigger
of the remaining pistol. It flashed
in the pan, but missed fire.</p>

<p>"Them pistols is old fashioned, like
yerself&mdash;ought to have the rale percushions,
ha, ha, ha!" laughed Devil-Bug,
but his laughter was of brief duration.</p>

<p>With a wild yell, gathering all her
strength for a desperate effort, the old
woman, bounded from the bed, and in
an instant, came plunging at the
throat of Devil-Bug, her arms outstretched,
and her long skinny fingers,
clutching him by the face and hair.
She hung upon him, like a living
Night-mare, her arms gathering convulsively
round his neck, while her
long nails, dug into his cheeks, like
the talons of a vulture.</p>

<p>"Help me, Gabr'el&mdash;" muttered
Devil-Bug, struggling fiercely with the
old woman&mdash;"Give me a lift, and I'll
choke her in a minnit&mdash;"</p>

<p>Gabriel looked up in surprise,
mingled with terror. His course was
taken in a moment. Closing the lid
of the small chest, heaped with doubloons,
he gathered it, in the embrace

<!-- page 204 col 1 -->

of his long arms, and winding his
dingy cloak round his shoulders,
made towards the door.</p>

<p>"Down the back staircase," he
muttered, hurrying through the door.
"I vill make my tracks!"</p>

<p>The old widow still clung to the
robber's neck, gathering him to her
withered form in an embrace, more
pressing than maternal. With a violent
effort Devil-Bug raised his arms,
and poising her a moment in the air,
dashed her to the floor. In an instant
she was on her feet again; in another
instant her arms were round his neck,
with one hand gathered in his hair,
and the other clutching him by the
face.</p>

<p>"What an old crittur! Not to
pare her nails!" muttered Devil-Bug,
as his face, and hands were wet with
his blood. I'll give ye a lesson, ye'll
never forgit, I will!"</p>

<p>"I'll larn ye to rob a poor lone woman,"
shrieked the widow.</p>

<p>Then commenced a contest, which
but a minute or two in duration, was
characterized on both sides by all the
malignant energy of wild beasts, fighting
for their prey. Again and again,
Devil-Bug, raised her in his arms and
dashed her to the floor; again and
again, she sprung to her feet, and
with the bound of a rattlesnake darting
on its victim, gathered her hands
round his throat. Along the floor,
Devil-Bug dragged her, upsetting
chairs and tables in the struggle; from
one end of the room to the other, with
the celerity of lightning, the combatants
passed, the old woman muttering
a suppressed shriek all the while, as
the hand of the robber was pressed
upon her mouth. Now around the

<!-- page 204 col 2 -->

bed, now along the hearth, scattering
ashes and firebrands in the air, now
against the wall, this desperate fight
was continued, the old woman struggling
with supernatural strength for
her life and her gold, while Devil-Bug
with all his muscular vigor, his arms
of iron sinew, and his fingers, whose
grasp was like the shutting of a vice,
found, for once, he had encountered
an antagonist as determined as himself.</p>

<p>"Murder Mur-<i>der!</i>" shrieked the
parrot, aroused from his nap, by the
sound of the contest.</p>

<p>"Ye'll cry murder, will ye?" cried
Devil-Bug, mistaking the cry of the
parrot, for a shriek of the old woman.
"I'll settle that business for you, I
will!"</p>

<p>His teeth were fixedly compressed,
as with one desperate effort he unloosed
the arms of the old woman
from his throat, and grasped her firmly
by the middle of the body. He fixed
his eye upon a massive knob surmounting
one of the brass andirons
before the fire, and, as a blacksmith
raises a hammer in his arms, he
swung the body of the old woman
suddenly on high. She uttered a
loud and piercing shriek&mdash;it was her
last! As the blacksmith with his
muscular arms, braced for the blow,
brings the hammer, whirling down
upon the anvil, so Devil-Bug, with his
hideous face, all a-flame with rage,
swung the body of the old woman
wildly over his shoulder, and with the
every impulse of his strength, gathered
for the effort, struck her head&mdash;her
long grey hairs streaming wildly all
the time&mdash;full against the knob of the
brass andiron.</p>

<!-- page 205 col 1 -->

<p>He raised her body in the air again
to repeat the blow, but the effort was
needless. The brains of the old woman
lay scattered over the hearth,
and the body which Devil-Bug raised
in the air, was a headless trunk, with
the bleeding fragments of a face and
skull, clinging to the quivering neck.</p>

<p>"B'lieve me soul, the old 'ooman's
hurt," muttered Devil-Bug, with a
ghastly smile, as he flung the body,
yet trembling with life, to the floor&mdash;"Ha!
ha!" he shouted, standing as
still as though suddenly frozen to
stone. "There's that feller at my
side with the jaw bruk and the tongue
stickin' out! There is, just as he fell
through the trap, and there, by his
side, is the old woman, with the brains
a-pourin' out from the empty skull!
There's two on 'em now&mdash;and they'll
always be with me&mdash;ah! ah! I'll
not stand this; I won't! Why can't
a feller kill his man or woman and
have done with em? But to have
'em this way, always with you.&mdash;&mdash;He,
he, he! <i>I begin to b'lieve in hell
now, I do!</i>"</p>

<p>He stood before the fire-place, with
his back to the portrait. The corse
of the old woman, the mangled fragments
of a face and skull, resting in
a pool of blood, lay at his very heels
along the hearth. In front of him, at
some distance along the floor, beside
the bed, stood the candle, now flickering
in its socket, and flinging a waning
light around the room. The face of
Devil-Bug was pale as ashes. His
lips were tightly compressed, and his
solitary eye glared out from the shadow
of the overhanging brow, like
the eye of a war-horse, with the
death-arrow in his heart. His hands

<!-- page 205 col 2 -->

hung stiffened by his side, his entire
appearance, was that of a man whom
some wierd enchantment is transforming
to lifeless stone. The cold sweat
in big and clammy drops, streamed
over his tawny visage, and his eye
grew more vivid and intense in its
burning gaze.</p>

<p>"I hear the critter groan&mdash;" he
muttered, without moving the fraction
of an inch from his statue-like position&mdash;"Somethin'
evil is goin' to happen
to me! Just as he fell through
the hatchway, his jaw broke and
his tongue out he lays afore me!
And he moves his blood-shot eyes
and waggles his tongue, and groans
an' groans! And the old woman's
there too! She's layin' at my back,
I know, but there she is, at my side&mdash;the
brains oozing out from the hollow
skull!"</p>

<p>For a moment the murderer trembled
from head to foot.</p>

<p>"By God!" he muttered the oath
with deep emphasis&mdash;and this was a
singular thing for Devil-Bug to do,
for he scarcely ever swore by the
name of the Almighty&mdash;"By God! I
do&mdash;<i>I do begin to b'lieve that there
is a hell!</i>"</p>

<p>And around his feet and over the
hearth, silently and slowly the blood
of the murdered woman began to flow
and spread, while the ghastly corse,
with the hollow skull oozing with
clotted flesh and brains, lay huddled
in a shapeless heap, the hand contorted
with the spasm of death, and the stiffened
limbs flung along the bricks, in
the crouching position peculiar to a
violent and a bloody death.</p>

<p>Murder was in that room in its most
awful form. Like a terrible Presence,

<!-- page 206 col 1 -->

it seemed to darken the very air of
the room, and chill the strong heart
of the murderer. The light flickered&mdash;dimly
in the socket, and then sank
down, after sudden glare, and all was
dark as midnight.</p>

<p>"It's gone out&mdash;" muttered Devil-Bug,
as his heart gathered a strange
courage from the darkness, which
took the sight of all outward objects
from his view&mdash;"It's gone out! Why
shouldn't I fill my pockets with some
o' the old woman's plunder? Ha, ha,
ha! Why not? Devil-Bug ain't so
easily skeered, I tell ye&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned toward the fire-place as
he spoke. He was about to prosecute
his researches in the darkness when
the light, which he had fancied extinguished,
flared up from its socket,
and lit the room with a sudden glare.
That glare was but for an instant,
and yet by its red light Devil-Bug,
with his face turned to the hearth,
beheld the dark eyes of the portrait
gazing fixedly upon him. He had not
observed this portrait before. But
now, as the pale cheeks glowed in the
momentary glare of the dying candle,
as the dark eyes grew suddenly brilliant,

<!-- page 206 col 2 -->

and the hair seemed to wave and
float in the ruddy light, while the
background of this picture, the frame
and all its minor details were wrapt
in thick darkness, Devil-Bug thought
he beheld, not a portrait or a mere
piece of inanimate canvass, but a
breathing and living woman, whose
look was fixed upon his face in terrible
reproof.</p>

<p>"Nell!" he shrieked&mdash;"The gal
come to life agin, jist as she was
seventeen years ago! Ho, ho, ho!
<i>I do believe there is&mdash;a God&mdash;that's
a fact!</i>"</p>

<p>The light went out and all was
darkness. Devil-Bug, with a wild
yell, fled from the room, his footsteps
echoed through the next chamber, and
in a moment resounded from the private
stairway leading into the yard.
Again and again that wild yell,
mingled with a woman's name, broke
upon the air, and then all was still.</p>

<p>Silence, and darkness, and murder,
were only the tenants of the Ghost-Room,
while the oozing blood began
to harden over the cold bricks of the
fire-place.</p>

<p class="small">LUKE HARVEY IN THE GHOST-ROOM.</p>

</div>

<p>LUKE raised his blood-stained hands
in the light, and stood chained to the
spot with horror. In a moment he
mastered the dead and icy feeling of
awe which began to change his very
heart to stone. He seized the candle,
he rushed up the stairway, and stood
before the door of the Ghost-Room.
The light which he grasped flashed
through the open door of the back-room.
It was silent and untenanted
by human being. The door, opening
on the private staircase, hung slightly
open. Luke gazed through the doorway
of the back-room again and again,
but his gaze, never for a single instant,
wandered into the Ghost-Room, whose
opened door laid its Secret bare to his
glance. </p>

<p>He stood at the door with the light
in his hand, trembling with a strange
fear, but he dared not enter the
room.</p>

<p>Even as he stood, footsteps, hushed
and softened, came echoing faintly

<!-- page 207 col 2 -->

from the private staircase, and in a
moment, through the doorway at its
head, there stole the figure of a stout
man, wrapped in a thick overcoat,
with a pistol in one hand and a thick
knotted mace in the other. One by
one, at his heels, there followed twelve
muscular men, dressed and armed
like their leader. Luke neither heard
nor saw them, but stood as if frozen to
the floor, with his head turned away
from the door of the Ghost-Room.</p>

<p>"Why Harvey&mdash;is that you?"
cried the leader of the band of twelve&mdash;"Has
them fellers been here&mdash;hey?
Or am I too early? Easy Larkspur
is generally too early. Why what's
the matter with you, man? Where's
the old woman, and the gal? Strike
me stoopid, if you hain't struck
dumb!"</p>

<p>Luke silently pointed to the Ghost-Room.</p>

<p>Larkspur seized the candle and,
followed by the twelve police officers,
hurriedly rushed into the chamber.</p>

<p>There was a pause for a single moment,
and then from every man there

<!-- page 208 col 1 -->

yelled one involuntary and awful
shriek of horror.</p>

<p>"By G&mdash;d we're too late!" muttered
Larkspur, in a voice whose emphasis
of horror was in fearful contrast
with his usual devil-may-care tones&mdash;"The
party has been here afore us,
and finished their job!"</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you&mdash;" cried a Police
Officer&mdash;"That the feller, whom we
saw shinnin' it down the alley, as we
came in the gate, was one of the party
from this house?"</p>

<p>"May I be hung for stealin' a tooth
pick from a match boy, if this ain't a
leetle a-head of my time!" exclaimed
Larkspur, and Luke could hear him,
walking hurriedly up and down the
room&mdash;"Too late, boys, too late, by
G&mdash;d!"</p>

<p>Luke gathered nerve for a sight of
horror, and slowly advancing into the
room, pushed through the band of police
officers, and gazed upon the
mangled corse&mdash;"Here's some of the
fruits of my d&mdash;d plot to catch the
thieves&mdash;" he said in a husky voice,
as he gazed upon the shapeless mass,
which but five minutes before, had been
a living and breathing creature&mdash;"Larkspur
I thought that you were
hidden in the back-room, when I first
entered the house: but no matter. It's
all over now&mdash;"</p>

<p>His face was white as the death-shroud,
and his upper lip trembled
with an involuntary movement.</p>

<p>"Larkspur&mdash;" he said in a voice
which did not rise above a whisper&mdash;"Search
this room, and see&mdash;and&mdash;see&mdash;if
there is not another&mdash;another&mdash;corpse!"</p>

<p>"Och, Whilaloo! Ochone! Ochone!

<!-- page 208 col 2 -->

Murtherin' th-a-aves in the house ov
me misthress! Ochone!" a voice
came echoing from the main stairway
of the mansion&mdash;"Ochone! We're
ruinated and kilt intirely! Heard ye
iver the likes o' this?"</p>

<p>Peggy Grud came rushing into the
room, her hair flying about her head
in wild disorder, while with her clasped
hands upraised, she rent the air
with a succession of vivid shrieks.
The Police officers were between her
and the fire-place, and the fearful object,
laid along the floor, did not
meet her eyesight.</p>

<p>"Will ye git out o' this, ye murtherin'
blaggards? Where's my misthress?
Ochone&mdash;Ochone! Th-<i>a</i>-aves!
I'll riz the nabor'ud on ye&mdash;Where's
me misthress?"</p>

<p>Luke silently pushed the police
officers aside, and taking Peggy Grud
by the hand, led her forward.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;" he cried fixing his
snake-like eye upon her, with a glance
which she dared not face&mdash;"There is
your Mistress!"</p>

<p>"Murder, Mur<i>der!</i>" cried the Parrot,
rustling about in the cage above
the mantel piece.</p>

<p>Peggy Grud looked down upon the
corse, and then leaped into the very
air, with a start of unfeigned horror.
Uttering shriek after shriek, no longer
feigned by shrewd hypocrisy, but
wrung from her bosom, by the horrible
sight of the ghastly corse, combined
with her own guilty fears, Peggy
Grud, sank in a kneeling position
with her face averted from the dead
body, while she tore her hair, in very
madness.</p>

<p>"Who ses I did the murther?" she

<!-- page 209 col 1 -->

shrieked&mdash;"It's a lie! It's a lie! Who
ses I did the murther? It is a lie as
black as hell! Och&mdash;ochone!"</p>

<p>"Yer a purty pictur ain't you?"
cried Larkspur advancing from the
throng of police officers&mdash;"Yer a
purty thing, ain't ye? You'll be in all
the papers, now won't you? Oh, git
out, ye ugly cripple! Ye'll have your
portr'it in the Black Mail, with these

<p>True it was that the favorites of the
old lady who in the first uproar of the
contest, between her and Devil-Bug,
had slunk away into the nooks and
crannies of the room, now stole
forth from their hiding places, and
came purring and moaning round the
shapeless corse. They walked in
the old woman's blood, picking her
dress with their claws, as though to
arouse her from slumber, while they
looked up in the faces of the bystanders,
with an expression of brute anguish,
more painful to see, than the
deepest agony of a human countenance,
for the human countenance

<!-- page 209 col 2 -->

has a tongue to speak, while the brute
can only look and mourn.</p>

<p>Ike, the tortoise-shell cat, and Wesley
the blue-and-white cat&mdash;to give
them the fanciful names, by which the
old lady knew them&mdash;Nappy, the
black cat with snake-like eyes, and
Washy the lubberly white cat, with a
sleepy look, all walked round the dead
body, staining their feet in the thick
blood, while with moan after moan,
they picked the torn dress of the old
woman, with their claws, and seemed
urging her to rise.</p>

<p>"Genelmen ain't that a sight for
you?" cried Larkspur in a tone of
feeling. No one replied. Luke stood
beside the corpse with his head drooped
over his folded arms.</p>

<p>"Genelmen ain't that a sight for
you? Here the cats and the hired gal!
The old woman fed 'em all! The
hired gal murders her missus&mdash;the
cats mourn for the death o' their missus!
Ain't that a sight genelmen?"</p>

<p>"Ochone&mdash;Ochone!" screamed Peggy
Grud&mdash;"What have I done? Jist

<p>CHAPTER SECOND.</p>

<p class="small">DORA AND LUKE.</p>

</div>

<p>"NO sign of violence, no mark of
murder, to tell the story of an untimely
death! The victim will lay, calm and
motionless, as though he had but resigned
himself to a pleasant slumber!
One moment his cheek glows with

<!-- page 210 col 1 -->

health&mdash;let but a drop from this phial,
pass his lips, and his face, will take
the hue of ashes, his heart grow cold
and lifeless! The world, ha, ha, ha!
The world, will wonder and stare, and
the Doctor, nodding sagely all the
while, will aver, by all the knowledge
of his craft, that Livingstone, came to
his death, through the natural result
of the fatal disease, which has been
gathering round his heart for years!</p>

<p>"I, alone, will hold the mystery of
his death, locked fast among the secrets
of my bosom!"</p>

<p>Dora Livingstone was alone. Alone
in that gorgeous chamber, which Livingstone
had delighted to crowd with
the evidences of his wealth. Situated
in a central part of his mansion, it
was illumined by a splendid chandelier,
whose price, told in round
heaps of dollars, would have bought
you a seat in Congress, or wrung
Justice, from the most impartial Bench.</p>

<p>The light of the chandelier, subdued
and softened, by thick shades of
costly glass, fell around the chamber
with the effect of moonlight, disclosing
the satin hangings, which concealed
the lofty walls, the gorgeous carpet
laid along the floor, and the splendid
furniture, which gave an appearance
of extreme luxury to the place.
The wide hearth, surmounted by a
mantel, adorned with vases of alabaster,
was enlivened by the glow of
a cheerful wood-fire, whose gleams,
now shot flashingly along the room,
and now died away, into a steady and
cheerful blaze. All around the walls,
among the hangings of crimson satin,
pictures in gorgeous frames, received
the glow of the chandelier full on their

<!-- page 210 col 2 -->

canvass, every inch of which, had
been made immortal by the hand of
one of the Painter-Genii of the old
world. Venus rising from the bath,
fresh in the lustre of her charms,
Apollo erect in the glory of youthful
manhood, Daphne awaiting the approach
of the god, Eve bending over
the fountain, in whose clear waves,
she saw another Eve, radiant as herself;
such were a few of the figures,
beaming from the pictures, hung along
the walls, with the rich folds of the
satin hangings falling carelessly aside
from their heavy frames.</p>

<p>The chamber, we say, was crowded
with evidences of Livingstone's
wealth. On the centre-table of rich
Mosaic were caskets of ebony, glittering
with the jewels of Dora, the Merchant's
wife; rare curiosities, prized
and costly from their very variety;
vases of alabaster; antique gems,
rich with the fairy-sculpture of some
classic Artist; and all the costly spoils
which gold, that conqueror and despoiler
of Art, more unrelenting than
the Goth or Corsican, had won from
the galleries and cabinets of Rome and
Florence. The carpet, whose gorgeous
hues overspread the floor, considered
by itself alone, was worth the
price of a first rate statesman, as
statesmen are valued in the political
market; while the elegant sofa and
the chairs, elaborate with Gothic
work, and embroidery, turned into
gold, would have bought up a dozen
patriots of the common order. Altogether,
the room was full of wealth,
luxury, and splendor, and here it
was that Dora, uncompanioned save
by her own dark thoughts, had retired

<!-- page 211 col 1 -->

to arrange her plans and hasten on
the fatal crime, on whose result she
had perilled her soul.</p>

<p>But an hour returned from the
Theatre, where she had shone among
the magnates of the Quaker City nobility,
she had thrown aside her costly
robes and assumed a garb, whose
loose folds, gathering gently around
her queenly form, displayed her
beauty to more advantage than all
the silks of France, or costumes of an
Imperial Court.</p>

<p>Seated in that article of furniture
peculiarly American, a rocking chair,
with her head thrown back, her eyes
upturned with their lids half-closed,
while her dark tresses, released from
comb or braid, fell carelessly over
her shoulders, the lady was enrobed
in a gown of faint azure satin, whose
ample development of shape&mdash;or
want of shape&mdash;wide sleeves and
swelling folds, gathered round her
bust, and waist, and limbs, with a
voluptuous adaptation to every outline
of her faultless form.</p>

<p>Her arms were crossed carelessly
over her bosom, while the softened
light of the chandelier fell warmly
over the whiteness of her small hands
and rounded shoulders; snowy and
roseate as alabaster, tinged by the
flush of daybreak. Her feet, in all
their delicate outlines, unconfined by
slipper or stocking, peeped from the
heavy folds of her night-robe, white
as Parian marble, and quite as beautiful
in their proportions as these from
which Canova modelled the feet of
his Venus.</p>

<p>Certainly a beautiful woman is the
greatest wonder of God's universe!
Certainly the remarkable combination

<!-- page 211 col 2 -->

of beauties, presented by her form,
the outlines, rounded and flowing,
whether manifested in the fulness of
the bust or the faultless symmetry of
the limbs; the various hues which are
combined in her person, the deep
black of her hair, the soft rose tint of
her cheek and lips, the alabaster of
her hands and neck and shoulders,
the lustrous darkness of her eye, and
the blackness of her brows and
lashes; the magic of her walk, each
limb moving in as much harmony
with the general effect, as the star
circling in its orbit, compares in the
regularity of its motion with star;
certainly, we say, these beauties and
graces afford more convincing proof
of God's power, than the whole universe
combined!</p>

<p>But then, when we add to these, the
attractions of her soul, that strange
magnetism of her look, which enchains
and fascinates, that varied intonation
of voice, which can awe us
in a whisper, or bring us to ruin with
a word, that power to flatter, to gloze
a falsehood and cover the naked
blackness of a lie with such a delicate
surface of ivoried-fiction; when we
remember that by the pressure of her
hand, slight, warm and thrilling, she
can lure the Preacher from his pulpit,
the Statesman from his solemn
thoughts, the grave Justice from his
Bench; it becomes a wonder, why that
most wonderful of all things, a beautiful
woman, was ever permitted by the
Creator to have the power of evil
entrusted to her nature!</p>

<p>Here we have Dora Livingstone
sitting in yonder rocking chair by the
light of that splendid chandelier, as

<!-- page 212 col 1 -->

beautiful as God's own light, and yet,
in her heart, as corrupt as the blackness
of hell! Is she not beautiful?
Mark the head, thrown backward,
the soft flush warming over her face,
the half-closed lids, the parted lips,
so rich, so small, and yet so full and
ripe in their redness and shape; mark
the glossy blackness of her hair,
sweeping down in careless clusters to
her shoulders, and those very shoulders!
how round their outline, how
soft their surface, how bewitching
that dimple, indenting itself like a
living smile into the centre of each
shoulder, just where the full arms are
joined to the queenly bust! Ah-ha!
The bust! How it heaves beneath
the careless folds of the satin gown&mdash;slowly,
slowly, higher and yet higher,
like a wave hidden by a snow-flake!</p>

<p>The hands lightly crossed over that
bosom, the tapering fingers, the dimples
along the surface of the white
skin, where the fingers, join the hand
itself, the clear nails, tinged with a
circle of deep red around their edges!
That glimpse of a wrist and an arm,
disclosed by the wide sleeve, as it
falls, carelessly aside! The slender
waist, its shape revealed by the voluptuous
(a good word for anything that
is easy in position, swelling in outline,
bewitching in general effect) folds
of the satin robe! The full proportions
of the lower part of her form,
suggest mingled ideas of stateliness
ripeness and beauty; pleasant images
of white swans, smiling grandly
over smooth waters, ripe peaches,
heavy from their very ripeness,
hanging lusciously from some bending
bough; or soft daybreaks, or
lovely sunsets, or still midnights, or

<!-- page 212 col 2 -->

indeed anything, whose beauty is
without comparison!</p>

<p>And then, the feet! Ha, ha, we
have come down to the feet, and these,
let me tell you, are not the most contemptible
of Dora's beauties! The
high instep&mdash;do smile at our minuteness&mdash;the
long and narrow form, the
shape of the toes, the nails, like the
fingers, tinged, each of them, with a
deep circlet of red!</p>

<p>A look at the face, again! Do not
those red lips, with glimpses of the
ivory teeth, stealing out upon you,
from the interval of the moist vermilion,
do they not, look as though they
were but made for a man to kiss once,
and then die? The eye&mdash;gleaming
between the half-closed lids, beaming
from the shadow of the long and
trembling lashes, how beautiful they
are, as veiled in a lustrous moisture,
a mist-like dimness, they indicate the
soul, absorbed in a reverie! The
broad forehead (a thing we do not
always like to see in woman) the dark
eyebrows, the regularly shaped nose&mdash;Grecian
with the slightest inclination,
toward the aquiline&mdash;the firm, round
chin&mdash;ha, ha!</p>

<p>Here's a beautiful woman, sitting
easily in the rocking-chair, as a good
wife, who has not a single bad thought
should sit, and yet this beautiful woman,
is already in heart a Murderess!</p>

<p>Already false to the Honor of her
husband, she now would assail his
Life! And she, so beautiful, so queenly
and so like the impersonation of a pure
Thought in every outline of her form!
And this, was once a confiding, loving,
and boasting girl; but the Canker of
Ambition, has wormed itself into her
Soul, the atmosphere of Sensuality, has

<!-- page 213 col 1 -->

changed her inner nature, while her
outward beauties remain the same!
Alas! Alas! Why did not Eve stay
at home in the garden of Eden, and
refrain from wandering about, she
knew not whither, and plucking forbidden
fruit, and listening to handsome
serpents? Ever since that fatal hour,
too many of her fair daughters, have
not only plucked, but turned themselves
into, forbidden fruit; not only
listened to handsome serpents, but
transformed themselves into very
snakes, whose venom of sting, is but
ill-recompensed by their glittering and
brilliant exterior!</p>

<p>"No mark of violence, no sign of
murder, to tell the story of an untimely
death!" the thought, flashed over the
mind of the wife, but did not shape
itself into words&mdash;"The world, will
say, he died of that fatal disease,
which threatened him for years!
Dora of Lyndeswold, ha, ha! Algernon,
thinks he can mould me to his
slightest purpose! What if the block
of marble, should seize the chisel,
and change places, with the Sculptor?"</p>

<p>Extending her hand, she lifted the
small bell, from the white cloth of the
table at her side. A moment, and the
silvery sound of the bell, rung round
the room.</p>

<p>The servant in Livery, presented
himself at the door.</p>

<p>"Did you ring, Ma'am?"</p>

<p>"What time did Mr. Livingstone
say he would return home?" exclaimed
Dora, without turning her eyes, in
the direction of the door, which was
behind the back of her chair.</p>

<p>"Ha'past ten ma'am."</p>

<p>"It is now half-past ten." she exclaimed

<!-- page 213 col 2 -->

looking at her watch.&mdash;"You
may bring in the coffee, Thomas."</p>

<p>"Coffee for you and Mr. Livingstone?
Yes ma'am&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Livingstone was alone again.
Raising her form languidly from the
half-reclining position, in which she
had lain, Dora, lifted her right hand,
slowly to her very eyes, and gazed
intently upon a small phial, clasped
between her delicate fingers. The
phial not larger, than the most delicate
finger on her snowy hand, was filled
with a liquid, clear as crystal, which
sparkled like a star, within the glass
as she raised it in the light. Wrapping
her spotless handkerchief, carefully
around it, as ladies are wont to
do, with their smelling bottles, Dora
again relapsed into her half-reclining
position on the back of the rocking
chair.</p>

<p>"A drop, fresh from the phial,
mingled with any liquid is sure to kill!
But it must be applied, the moment
ere the victim drinks, or it is harmless!
That paper of the Doctor's did
me good service&mdash;thanks to the cant
of the day, which educates young
girls, as though they were intended
for anything else, but wives or mothers,
I learned something of chymistry
at Boarding school; that was before
father died. To-day, I have despatched
twenty servants, twenty different
ways, for the various drugs,
with which to prepare in liquid: suspicion,
cannot lay a finger's weight
upon me!"</p>

<p>"Coffee ma'am, for you and Mr.
Livingstone, Ma'am&mdash;" said Thomas,
entering with two porcelain cups&mdash;smoking
with coffee&mdash;which he placed
upon the small table, beside her chair.

<!-- page 214 col 1 -->

This done, Thomas, who looked as
though he had been born in his grey
and velvet livery, with but the power of
saying yes ma'am, no ma'am, retired
from the room, in the same formal manner,
which had marked his entrance.</p>

<p>Dora relapsed into her reverie,
again. A footstep sounded in the entry,
leading to the chamber. Her
frame, quivered with a slight start,
but in an instant, she sank into the
chair again, with her head thrown
backward on the soft velvet cushioning.
Another moment and the footstep
grew nearer.</p>

<p>"It is he!" she muttered, and
with an effort, maintained her careless,
half-slumbering attitude. As
she spoke, the door opened, and she
heard the pressure of the footstep
upon the carpet.</p>

<p>"My dear, you have been absent
very long&mdash;" said Dora, languidly,
without moving from her position.</p>

<p>A slight, yet deep-toned laugh,
echoing behind her chair, was the
only answer she received from the
new-comer.</p>

<p>"Ha! I should know that laugh&mdash;"
she cried, starting, "Luke Harvey!"
she murmured as she beheld the form
of the stranger&mdash;"Luke Harvey, and
at this hour! That man is my evil
fate!"</p>

<p>"Excuse this intrusion, madam&mdash;"
exclaimed Luke, advancing with a
slight bow&mdash;"Mr. Livingstone made
an appointment to meet me at this
hour. He is not in, I perceive?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Livingstone is not at home!"
exclaimed Dora, rising, even in her
dishabille, with an air of freezing politeness.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, well&mdash;" replied Luke,

<!-- page 214 col 2 -->

fixing his dark eyes upon her beautiful
face&mdash;"Well, well, it makes no
difference. I'm one of that class who
can either wait or be 'put off&mdash;' "</p>

<p>And as he spoke, with the coolest
manner in the world, he drew a chair
and sate down on the opposite side of
the table. Dora gazed upon him in
utter surprise. With one hand she
seized her dark tresses and bound
them up within her comb, while with
an instinctive movement, she withdrew
her naked feet under the shadow
of her satin night-robe.</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried Luke, sleepily, with
a slight yawn, as he drummed on his
hat with his fingers "Ha! hum!
Cool evening, ma'am!"</p>

<p>"<i>Sir</i>&mdash;" exclaimed Dora, as her
proud form towered proudly erect&mdash;"This
is my private chamber. You
can wait for Mr. Livingstone in the
hall, down stairs&mdash;"</p>

<p>She fixed her dark eyes upon him
as though she would wither him with
a look.</p>

<p>" 'Sir!' " echoed Luke, with that
sneering laugh which sometimes gave
his sharp features the expression of a
sneering devil&mdash;" 'Sir' to <i>me!</i> Ha,
ha! Dora&mdash;too good that! '<i>Sir</i>'&mdash;ha,
ha, ha!"</p>

<p>" 'Dora' "&mdash;echoed the Merchant's
wife, in a tone of utter astonishment
as though she had not heard aright&mdash;"
'Dora'&mdash;indeed! You are either
mad or impertinent, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sit down, Dora, sit down and
compose yourself!" replied Luke,
still drumming on the crown of his
hat "Doesn't it strike you as extremely
odd, Dora, that you should
assume that freezing look and call <i>me
Sir!</i> D'ye remember the little back

<!-- page 215 col 1 -->

parlor in Wood Street, Dora, where
you used to sit on my knee and call
me, <i>Luke</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are insulting!" exclaimed
Dora, as one burning flush of indignation
brightened over her face, while
her dark eyes flashed fire&mdash;"Leave
the room, sir!"</p>

<p>" 'Luke, <i>dear</i> Luke,' you called
me, and, ha, ha, ha, kissed me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leave the room!" exclaimed
Dora, growing very white in the
face. Her voice was husky with
indignation.</p>

<p>"Those are fine lips of yours,
Dora! Your troth was plighted to
me then, Dora! Egad! What a
picture you present for an artist!
Fine study for a rising genius.&mdash;'The
Enraged Beauty!' One night
you kissed me so sweetly, Dora, so
lovingly! 'Good night, Luke,' and
kissed me! The next day you picked
a delightful quarrel with me, and forbade
your 'plighted love,' the house.
Why? Because the <i>rich</i> merchant,
Livingstone, had called at your mother's
dwelling. Your eye was fixed
upon <i>him</i>. The <i>poor</i> clerk was
eclipsed! In less than six months
you were Mrs. Albert Livingstone,
wife of the merchant prince.&mdash;'Sir,'
indeed! ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Livingstone shall be informed
of this insult!" said Dora, in a
deep low tone, that indicated the most
deadly anger. She rang the bell violently,
as she spoke.</p>

<p>"I presume you are about to order
your servants to thrust me from your
doors?" said Luke, his voice sinking
to a whisper, as he leaned over the
table, and awaited her answer.</p>

<!-- page 215 col 2 -->

<p>She made no reply, but sinking in
the chair, turned her face away from
her former lover, and with a gesture
of fierce anger, rang the bell as though
her life depended on its clamor.</p>

<p>"Thrust me from the doors! 'Dear
Luke,' you said, and kissed me!"
Luke bent slowly down, gazing at the
indignant woman through the shadow
of his thick eyebrows as he spoke.&mdash;"Do
you know, Dora, that I often
think of that little back parlor in
Wood Street? A splendid woman on
my knee, her full arms around my
neck, her soft whispers falling on my
ears like delightful music. 'When
we are married, Luke,' 'twas, thus,
you often whispered, 'we'll live together,
in some nice two-story house,
secluded from the world. Your salary
is small, Luke, and we may be
very poor, but'&mdash;and then you would
smile, Dora&mdash;'we have that which the
wealth of the Indies cannot give, love&mdash;Luke&mdash;love!'
<i>Then</i> you would
kiss me! When I shut my eyes, and
forget the Present, I can feel those
kisses still clinging to my lips!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Livingstone shall be informed
of this insult, sir," exclaimed Dora,
her brow darkening with rage, as with
her back turned toward Luke, she
clenched her hands in very anger.</p>

<p>"I pray you, inform Mr. Livingstone
of my conduct!" whispered
Luke, leaning over the table, as his
hand was thrust within his bosom.&mdash;"Have
me thrust from your doors,
inform Mr. Livingstone of my conduct;
but, but&mdash;" his voice sunk to a
whisper, like the hissing of a snake&mdash;"at
the same time inform him of the
contents of <i>this note!</i>"</p>

<!-- page 216 col 1 -->

<p>Leaning over the table, he held a
letter which he had taken from his
bosom, open to her gaze.</p>

<p>"What folly is this!" began Dora,
as she glanced over her shoulder at
the letter, which Luke held extended
in his hand. "Ah!" she shrieked,
in utter horror, as with a lightning
glance she caught a view of the superscription.&mdash;"My
letter to Fitz-Cowles! Oh God, I am in this man's
power!"</p>

<p>She buried her face in her hands,
while her hair, escaping from the
comb, fell wildly over her neck and
bosom.</p>

<p>"How interesting you look just
now! 'Good night, dear Luke!'
Will you inform Mr. Livingstone of
this insult; will you order the servant
to thrust me from the door?"</p>

<p>"Did you ring, ma'am?" exclaimed
Thomas, opening the door.</p>

<p>Dora started from her seat, and advanced
hurriedly toward the fire-place.
Her brow was darkened by a fearful
frown, and a big black vein marred
the beauty of her forehead.</p>

<p>"I am in his power!" she muttered
to herself.&mdash;"He can, by a single
word, scatter all my schemes to the
wind, and cover me with shame!
What! Endure the foul tongue of public
slander! Never! Ha! This man
must die! I have resolved upon my
course!" She turned to the servant,
and exclaimed in her usual commanding
tones&mdash;"Mr. Harvey will take
coffee, with me to-night. The coffee,
which you have placed upon the table
is cold. Bring in fresh coffee,
Thomas."</p>

<p>With a wild stare of amazement,
as though he suspected all was not

<!-- page 216 col 2 -->

right, Thomas closed the door, and
disappeared.</p>

<p>"You are a bold and desperate
man," cried Dora, as she advanced
toward the table, and gazed fixedly
in Luke's face. "I am in your
power! What would you with me?"</p>

"I thought <i>that</i> would bring you
down a peg or so!" exclaimed Luke,
smiling as he rattled the letter against
the table. "However, here's the
coffee"&mdash;he continued, as Thomas entered,
like a spirit, placed fresh cups
of coffee on the table, and in an instant
was gone. "Here's the coffee.
Take a cup with me, Dora! D'ye
remember those nice little suppers in
the back parlor in Wood Street?"</p>

<p>"Do me the favor, sir, to arrange
the fire on the hearth,"&mdash;exclaimed
Dora, in a tone as commanding as
though she spoke to the humblest of
her menials. "The room is quite
cold!"</p>

<p>Luke smiled pleasantly, as a man
is wont to smile, who indulges a child
in some trifling humor, and then turning
toward the fire-place, commenced
arranging the huge sticks of wood
upon the hearth.</p>

<p>A wild light flashed from Dora's
dark eyes. Bending slightly forward,
she held her right hand over one of
the porcelain cups, and taking the
cork from the small phial, she suffered
a single drop to mingle with the fragrant
coffee. It was the work of a
moment. When Luke turned again
from the fire-place, she was seated in
the rocking chair, her head thrown
back, as with her right hand upraised,
she made a show of applying salts to
her nostrils.</p>

<p>"Good coffee <i>this!</i>" said Luke, as

<!-- page 217 col 1 -->

he seated himself by the table. "Take
a cup, Madam?"</p>

<p>Dora silently raised the cup which
was untinctured with the contents of
the phial. As she lifted it to her lips
she silently watched Luke's movements,
over the edge of the cup.</p>

<p>"Good coffee," he exclaimed, "has
a pleasant fragrance!" He raised it
to his lips.</p>

<p>A slight start quivered through
Dora's frame. "He drinks!" the
thought flashed over her soul&mdash;"He
drinks! He is lost! In a moment
he will fall from the chair a lifeless
corse!"</p>

<p>"Good coffee, I say," exclaimed
Luke, gazing quietly at Dora, over
the edge of the uplifted cup. "Has
a surprising fragrance, but&mdash;" he hesitated,
slightly lowering the cup from
his lips, "but, Dora&mdash;" and a smile
of strange meaning crossed his lips.</p>

<p>"What mean you, sir?" she exclaimed,
sipping her coffee with a
careless air, while her heart swelled
to bursting, and her inmost soul was
thrilled with the appalling interest of
the scene. "What mean you, sir?"</p>

<p>"Fragrant coffee; but I prefer
Cogniac to Mocha," said Luke, quietly
placing the porcelain cup on the table,
without tasting its contents. "Ha,
ha! I can make the same remark to
you, that the convict made to the
hangman, who did his business in
such a bungling manner, that the
poor fellow, with his neck in the rope,
roared out a forcible reproof. I say,
you wasn't quick enough with the&mdash;'<i>drop!</i>'
Ha, ha! Pooh! You can't
poison me, Dora! I'm not one of
'them' kind!"</p>

<p>Dora could feel her heart grow cold

<!-- page 217 col 2 -->

in her bosom. For a single instant
she felt as though she was about to
fall dead on the floor. She had but
presence of mind to conceal the small
phial in the handkerchief, and place
it within the folds of her dress, when
her very reason seemed to fail her,
and pressing her hands against her
burning forehead, a single exclamation
escaped from her lips.</p>

<p>"All is lost!"</p>

<p>"Suppose I show the letter to your
husband?" said Luke, with a quiet
sneer, as he stood surveying her
agony, with a silent delight.</p>

<p>Her bosom rose heaving from the
folds of her dress, as though convulsed
by the agony of death. Still her
hands were pressed against her brow,
while her large black eyes, dilating
with a wild stare, glared fixedly in
the face of her torturer.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, to-morrow,"&mdash;the
thought came darkening over her soul&mdash;"I
will be the scoff and jeer of all
the fashionable circles! My name a
by-word&mdash;my reputation a bauble!
And more than all&mdash;more than the
scoff of the world, more than my
husband's hate, my plans will all be
scattered in ruins! No! No! I will
try my last hope with this man&mdash;he
loved me once! And how the
thought of the degradation galls me&mdash;now
I must kneel to him for mercy!"</p>

<p>"<i>Luke!</i>" she shrieked aloud, as
she rose on her feet, and stood before
him, a breathing picture of mortal
Agony, her hands convulsively clasped,
while her long dark hair, fell
glistening over her shoulders&mdash;"<i>Luke!</i>"</p>

<p>"That sounds better than 'Sir,' "&mdash;replied
Luke in the same dry and
biting tone.</p>

<!-- page 218 col 1 -->

<p>"Spare me Luke!" she shrieked
flinging herself on her knees at his
feet&mdash;"Spare me Luke!"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! The beauty of the
Quaker City at my feet!"</p>

<p>He said this with his usual dry and
caustic laugh, but the spectacle, began
to touch the chords of his dark and
mysterious nature.</p>

<p>Her dark hair showering over her
shoulders, the loose robe floating wildly
around her voluptuous form, her
womanly bosom rising into view, her
hands clasped, and her eyes glaring
with a vacant stare, she shrieked forth,
in a voice whose agony of emphasis,
no words can depict&mdash;"By the memory
of the love, you once felt for
me, oh spare me! Mercy, Luke, in
God's name, mercy!"</p>

<p>"That love, which wound your
image round my heart, as never man's
love entwined the image of mortal woman
before&mdash;that love you trampled
upon!" and his snake-like eye gleamed
with a savage light&mdash;"Had you been
but a bosom friend, and stolen my
money, I would have forgiven you!
Had you been my wife, and left me
for dishonor, I might still have forgiven
you! But girl that you were,
you trampled upon a heart, that would
have bled its last drop for you, you
trifled with a soul, that would have
dared eternal ruin for your sake!
Spare you? Never!"</p>

<p>The cool and biting tone in which
he spoke, restored Dora, to full consciousness
and reason. She saw that
her very soul hung in a fearful balance;
and by one quick operation of
her genius, she resolved to fling the
weight of her charms into the scale.</p>

<p>"Luke&mdash;" she cried, spreading her

<!-- page 218 col 2 -->

arms toward him, as she knelt at his
feet, while her eyes, swimming with
well-affected passion, were fixed upon
his countenance&mdash;"You once loved
me Luke&mdash;you will spare me, now!"</p>

<p>As if by accident she suffered the
folds of her night-gown, to slip aside,
and her white shoulder, with all its
faultless symmetry of shape, lay open
to the beams of the light.</p>

<p>Luke gazed upon her, and felt his
heart relent! She knelt before him,
an embodied Tempest of voluptuous
loveliness. Her cheeks flushed in
lively hues, her eyes, beaming passion,
her long dark hair streaming down to
her uncovered shoulders, glimpses of
her bosom, whose womanly fullness,
now grew animate with voluptuous
agitation rising slowly in the light&mdash;Luke
gazed upon her and thought of
the olden time.</p>

<p>"Mercy, Luke! Mercy!"</p>

<p>"On one condition&mdash;" he exclaimed
in a whisper, that thrilled to her very
heart.</p>

<p>"And that is&mdash;"</p>

<p>He hissed a single word, in her ear,
as his dark eyes, drank in the living
picture of her beauty.</p>

<p>She started as though an adder had
stung her.</p>

<p>"Never!" she shrieked with a
glance of unfeigned indignation.
"Sooner will I face the very worst!
The world's scorn and my husband's
hate!"</p>

<p>She had prepared herself, to use all
the influence of her charms, to win
mercy from his iron heart, but&mdash;to
<i>sell herself for the letter!</i> The
thought aroused all that pride, which
had been the first cause of her ruin.</p>

<p>"This letter published, the world

<!-- page 219 col 1 -->

will call you an&mdash;<i>Adultress!</i> A
pretty word, Dora!"</p>

<p>She quivered in every limb, as the
foul word, broke on her ears. Dropping
her head upon her bosom, she
clasped his knees with her trembling
hands. The cup of her degradation
was full.</p>

<p>"I consent&mdash;" she murmured&mdash;"Do
with me what you will!"</p>

<p>"The letter is yours, Dora&mdash;" he
said in a husky voice&mdash;"You place
yourself in my power?"</p>

<p>"I have sold myself to you&mdash;" her
voice sunk to a whisper, almost
inaudible "The price this witness of
my guilt!"</p>

<p>Luke gathered his arms around her
form as she knelt before him, and
bending her head slightly backward
gazed upon her face. Her eyes were
dimcast and a deep crimson flush
mantled over her face. She lay in
his arms, motionless as a statue, yet
living as a flame. Luke slowly raised
her from the floor; her head drooped
on his shoulder, and her bosom throbbed
warmly against his breast. For
a single moment, the light of passion
subdued the cold and snake-like gleam
of his eyes, but even in that instant,
the face of the fair and unknown girl,
whom he had seen that morning for
the first time in his life, rose like a
guardian angel before him, and with
that vision, a frown darkened over his
forehead, and an expression of scorn
trembled on his lip.</p>

<p>"You place yourself in my power,
Dora! Ha, ha! Here's beauty for
the sight and touch&mdash;here's soft
glances of the eyes, kisses of the lip,
pressures of the moist hand, all for

<!-- page 219 col 2 -->

sale! And I, I, with the most beautiful
woman in the Quaker City in
my arms, waiting to become mine&mdash;&mdash;I,
with this living picture of health,
loveliness and passion, in my arms
proffering her lip to my kiss, her bosom
to my touch &mdash;&mdash;I have still the
<i>moral</i> self denial, ha, ha, ha! to
scorn the embraces of an&mdash;&mdash;<i>Adultress!</i>"</p>

<p>With that mocking laugh he flung
her rudely from him, and rushed from
the room.</p>

<p>Extending her arms with a faint
effort to preserve her balance, she fell
insensible to the floor.</p>

<p>God save from the vengeance of
this woman, the man who dared to
put such galling scorn upon her!
There she lay, all her pride and beauty
brought down to the dust, there she
lay, her cheeks pale as death, her lips
parted, and her eyes, glaring upon the
ceiling with an unconscious stare,
there she lay, insensible and motionless,
but the Fiend was locked within
that faultless form; within the snowy
whiteness of that bosom, now gleaming
coldly in the light, was Hell.</p>

<p>CHAPTER THIRD.</p>

<p class="small">THE FREE BELIEVERS AND TRUE
REPENTERS.</p>

</div>

<p>" 'GENELMEN, my daddy vos a
scavenger and my mommy sold
rags!' On my travels again, ha,
ha! Let me compare notes with myself&mdash;and
first of all, that scene with
Dora! Don't know what in the

<!-- page 220 col 1 -->

deuce possessed me to work her up
so; Livingstone merely requested me
to leave a note with her, in which he
stated that business would detain him
at the counting-house all night. I
called to leave the note, found her
alone, and I suppose some devil must
have inspired me, for I never planned
that scene myself, no, never! A
pretty mess I've got myself into, with
all this planning and plotting! The
old woman murdered, the Jew and
Devil-Bug escaped, and all my work
to do over again! Peggy Grud, however,
is safe: and the 'proper authorities'
have promised to leave the arrest
of Devil-Bug to me; I'll manage him
before to-morrow night, or my name
isn't Luke! And that pale-faced girl,
with the soft eyes and dark hair&mdash;Parson
Pyne's daughter, is she? I'll
know more about her, <i>too</i>, before I'm
many hours older!"</p>

<p>Attired in the rags of Brick-Top,
with the red hair falling over his eyes,
and his face all smeared with paint
and invested with huge crimson
whiskers, Luke was hurrying down
Third Street, his hands in his pockets,
and his body thrown forward, while
his walk was that of a genuine loafer,
being made up of an Indian's tramp
when on a war-path, and a Highlander's
characteristic trot; a sort of
half-walk and half-run, with a slight
sprinkling of a lazy lounge.</p>

<p>To say that Luke did not relish
these excursions, for the adventure's
sake alone, would be doing him rank
injustice. He found as much pleasure
in pursuing the thread of a difficult
enterprise, which combined danger,
romance, and mystery, as the most
indefatigable novel-reader finds in the

<!-- page 220 col 2 -->

pages of a book like Rookwood.*
where the attention is, from first to
last, rivetted and enchained by one
passage of breathless interest succeeding
another, in transitions as rapid
and thrilling as the changes of some
well-contested battle.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>[*The author begs leave to record his
humble admiration of Wm. Harrison Ainsworth,
whom all the starch-and-buckram
critics have been abusing so heartily for years.
Rookwood is a production of which Walter
Scott might have been proud. Ainsworth
understands the art and theory of the plot of
a story better than any living writer.</p>

<p>Among other remarkable things, uttered
by an industrious compiler, named Griswold,
who, with singular modesty, has taken upon
himself to say who are, and who are not, the
Poets of America; the following passage is
one of the most remarkable&mdash;"<i>Mr. Cooper is
less read in the United States than Harrison
Ainsworth</i>." Passing over the solemn joke
of '<i>Mister</i>ing' the greatest Novelist that
ever gave a literary name to our country
abroad, or enchained his million-readers at
home, we come to the implied sneer on the
genius of Ainsworth; for though it's a very
dull attempt at sarcasm, still the intelligent
Griswold, with that commendable <i>effort</i>,
which marks all his compilations, meant to
be very bitter by insinuating this comparison
between the two men. In the first place, the
<i>fact</i> about Cooper being less read than Ainsworth,
is a compiler's <i>fact;</i> about as substantial,
sometimes, as his title of Reverend, or
his claims to the acumen of a critic or the
power of a genius. In the next place, we
humbly opine, that works like Rookwood
and Crichton are not to be killed with a
sneer, although that sneer comes from the
same pen, that (with its twin-scissors) has
compiled a small library of "Poetry"&mdash;"Annuals"&mdash;"Curiosities"&mdash;"Sermons"&mdash;"Cock
Robins"&mdash;illustrated&mdash;and "Jack
the Giant killers"&mdash;in cloth, with notes.]</p>

</div>

<p>"Here's a new mystery&mdash;" muttered
Luke, as he struck into a bye-street&mdash;"Mary
Arlington missing and
her brother in the bargain! Egad,
this will be an eventful Christmas, if

<!-- page 221 col 1 -->

things keep on this way. However,
my business to-night is to follow in
the footsteps of the illustrious Parson
Pyne! In the first place, I must
make for his Lecture Room&mdash;"</p>

<p>Passing from the bye-street into a
dark alley, where the winter wind
was doing a fierce concert on its own
account, while the clear, cold stars
shone down between the intervals of
the roofs that almost met overhead;
Luke presently halted under the light
of a lamp which projected from the
wall of an old brick building, illuminated
the dingy confines of an entry,
disclosed by an open door. Above
the door, a large sign bore the legend,
in bright yellow letters painted on a
dark ground&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">FREE BELIEVERS' AND TRUE REPENTERS'</p>

<p>LECTURE ROOM,</p>

and True Repenter</i>.</p>

<p class="small">UP STAIRS. &#9758;</p>

</div>

<p>"Fat Pyne is piling on the agonies"&mdash;exclaimed
Luke, as the sound of a
voice, shouting out something in a
very hoarse tone, came echoing from
a distance&mdash;"I'll go up and get a little
patent grace from Pyne: I will
that!"</p>

<p>"Brethren and Sisters I ask you
a plain question, and I want a plain
answer! We have assembled on a
most interesting occasion, I might say
a sublime occasion, to which all other
occasions are but a mole-hill to the
mighty Andes, or a gin-shop to the
Palace of Nebuchadnezzar! We have
met together to forward the objects of
our grand Association which, as you

<!-- page 221 col 2 -->

all know, is called 'The Universal
Patent-Gospel Missionary Society, for
the conversion of the Pope of Rome&mdash;in
particular&mdash;and the suppression
of Vatican Paganism&mdash;in general.'
We are a-going to send the Gospel to
benighted Rome! Trembling in his
pontifical robes, with a Bull in one
hand, and a cup o' coffee in the other,
the mighty Anti-Christ shall start in
his Vatican when he hears our thunder
a-booming over the fragrant plains
of idolatrous Italy. He shall hear our
thunder, and while his knees tremble,
and his eyes water, he shall ask his
four-and-twenty Cardinals, as they
sit revelling in oysters and wine&mdash;'Boys,
what's <i>that!</i>' And they shall
answer, turning white from very fear&mdash;'That's
the American Patent-Gospel,
Pope! That's the roaring of a
real Buffalo a-seekin' to fight your
Bull!' And then the Pope shall ask,
what <i>is</i> the American Patent-Gospel?
As he speaks, our answer shall thunder
in his ears! Our Gospel is a
patent-improved Gospel; a terrifier;
a scorcher; a real Locomotive-off-the-track
sort of a Gospel! We hold it
to be a comfortable doctrine, to abuse
the Pope o' Rome afore breakfast, and
after breakfast, and all day long!</p>

<p>We hold it to be a consoling belief
that of all the millions o' human bein's
ever created by the Lord, three-fourths
of them are roasting in the
broad lake o' fire and brimstone, this
very minnit! Our Gospel is a gospel
of fire and brimstone and abuse
o' the Pope o' Rome, mingled in
equal quantities&mdash;about half o' one
and half o' t'other&mdash;that's what our
Gospel is!"</p>

<p>Standing on his small pulpit, which

<!-- page 222 col 1 -->

looked something like a cross between
a watch-box and a bath-tub, the
Reverend Mr. Pyne, extending his
arms, with his coat thrown back, and
his portly paunch thrust forward, his
broad face red as a turkey's gills,
and his watery eyes starting from
their sockets, thundered forth the
solemn assertion yet once more&mdash;"Fire
and brimstone in the morning,
abuse o' the Pope o' Rome at night&mdash;Brimstone
and fire at night, abuse
o' the Pope o' Rome in the morning!
Turn it and twist it as you will, that's
what our Gospel is!"</p>

<p>One universal sensation spread
through the lecture room like wild
fire. The old women, sitting on the
first benches, in big black bonnets, and
long faces, groaned&mdash;positively groaned:
the old gentlemen, sitting behind
the old ladies, stuck their hands far
down in their pockets, and groaned in
chorus: while all the young men, in
white cravats, and all the young ladies
in straw bonnets, with flashing
ribbons, vented their enthusiasm in a
simultaneous cough.</p>

<p>The lecture room of the True Believers
and True Repenters was a
long and narrow apartment, with a
dingy white ceiling, from which depended
a rusty chandelier, and smoky
walls, lone, cheerless, and desolate in
its appearance, with here and there a
great spot of indefinable black, looking
as though the plaster had received
a bruise, and immense cracks, running
from ceiling to floor, like veins
in the lithograph of a coal mine. At
one end of this large room, was the
pulpit, looking, as we have said, like
a composition of a watch-box and a
bath-tub; at the other end was the

<!-- page 222 col 2 -->

narrow door, and between the door
and the pulpit were seated one dense
mass of human beings, male and female,
old and young, high and low,
rich and poor, packed together, along
uncomfortable benches of unpainted
pine, like sardines in a tin-box. Back
of the pulpit, on a green settee, were
gathered some dozen gentlemen, in
white cravats and sanctified faces,
their hands clasped on their crossed
knees, as bending earnestly forward,
they listened in painful intensity to the
words of Elder Pyne. Immediately
in front of the pulpit, around a large
table covered with green baize, in the
centre of which, was an inkstand, a
sheet of paper, and two quills, freshly
mended, some dozen more brothers
were seated on green chairs, their
heads thrown backward, and their
mouths wide open, as they all listened
to the words of the pious Brother
Pyne, with an acute earnestness quite
remarkable to behold.</p>

<p>"<i>That's</i> what our Gospel is!" continued
F. A. T. Pyne, with a final
flourish&mdash;"The various committees
appointed at the last meeting of our
Association, will now <i>Re</i>-port!"</p>

<p>One of the gentlemen sitting at the
back of the Rev. Pyne now arose and
came to the edge of the bath-tub, with
a great roll of paper in his hand. He
was a short little man, with a long
face, thin lips, and thick eyebrows,
which well-nigh concealed his diminutive
eyes.</p>

<p>"Brother Augustus Billygoat, from
the Committee on the Pope o'
Rome&mdash;" observed the Rev. Pyne, in
a suggestive tone to the assemblage.</p>

<p>"The <i>Com</i>-mittee on the Pope o'
Rome <i>do re</i>-port&mdash;" began Brother

<!-- page 223 col 1 -->

Billygoat in a voice, somewhat afflicted
by a cold&mdash;"That they have examined
into the Pope o' Rome, and
weighed him in the balances o' th'
Patent-Gospel; and he is found
wantin' as follers&mdash;"</p>

<p>A great sensation. One old woman
exclaimed "tremendous!" in a tone,
somewhat too loud, whereupon a brother
sitting on the next seat, pinched
her lovingly in the arm.</p>

<p>"He is found a wantin' whereas he
sends out bulls; and the scriptur' don't
tolerate any bulls! He's found a
wantin' because he lives in a sumptuous
palace called the Wattykin!
We defies the whole world to find the
name o' th' Wattykin in the Bible!
Friends and Brethren, we of this <i>Com</i>-mittee
think the day will come, and
is not long a comin' when the Pope o'
Rome, like Nebbykudneezir will have
to go to grass, and chaw roots for his
livvin'! The Watty-kin will be desolate!
The owl will hoot through its
walls, and the rooster crow from its
towers!</p>

<p>"With these few brief remarks, I
lays the report on the table without
readin' it in full, makin' a motion at
the same time, that it shall be printed
in The Universal American Patent-Gospel
Exposition for the instruction o'
futur' ages!"</p>

<p>The motion was carried by acclamation.
Brother Billygoat sat down
amid a murmur of applause.</p>

<p>Another Brother rose. He was a
man of the middle height, with a look
of deep sanctity oozing from the
parchment of his saffron skin. His
eyes were, as is often the case with
persons of remarkable piety, inclined
to be watery and dump-ish. His voice

<!-- page 223 col 2 -->

was a low-toned persuading kind of
voice slightly tinctured with a snuffle.
His hands were placed behind his
back, as he spoke, while his long, lank
hair fell carelessly around his cheeks
and over his ears.</p>

<p>It gave him great pleasure, he remarked,
to behold this demonstration.
With that he pointed emphatically at
the front bench, filled with old ladies
in large black bonnets. Such things
as this, were calculated to expand the
feelings, while they confirmed the religious
sentiment. As the Editor of
the Patent-Gospel Expositor, he felt
proud. As a Christian, he felt delighted.
As a Protestant of the Universal
American Patent-Gospel School,
he felt enraptured. He, too, considered
it his duty to testify to the abuses of
Papal Rome. Old Babylon, ought to
be exposed, laid out, and cut up.
Those were his sentiments. In order
to carry them fully into action he
would relate a painful incident.</p>

<p>The Captain of an American Brig,
which made a voyage to Naples, one
summer's day suggested to his crew
and passengers, that it would be a
capital idea to visit the old Pagan in
his Vatican. The Crew, the Passengers,
consented.</p>

<p>"They went to Rome&mdash;" continued
the Rev. Syllaybub Scissors, as the
Editor of the Patent-Gospel was
styled&mdash;"They saw the old Pagan.
There were ten men of the crew
and twenty passengers, not counting
a little boy. They all had tracts,
from the Patent-Gospellers Association
in their pockets. The Pope sat in his
chair, with a large number of Cardinals
in attendance. It may be as
well to remark, that the old Pagan

<!-- page 224 col 1 -->

keeps these cardinals as gentlemen in
waiting, to bring him coffee and muffins
or perhaps oysters. Well, the
crew and passengers, all dressed in
their best, took a view of old Anti-Christ.
But mark ye, brethren and
sisters, they are called upon to kiss
the Pope's toe. Like Americans, like
Patent-Gospellers, they refused. They
refused, the ten men of the crew, the
twenty passengers, and the little boy!
What was the consequence of the refusal?
What I say was the consequence?"</p>

<p>There was utter silence in the hall
of the Free Believers and True Repenters.
You might have heard a
pin drop.</p>

<p>"Why Brethren and Sisters, I'll
tell you!" cried Syllaybub Scissors,
growing very much excited&mdash;"Those
passengers, crew, captain, little boy
and <i>all, have never been heard of
since</i>. (Great sensation!) They
went into the Vatican, it is true, but
<i>they never came out again!</i> (Tremendous
excitement) I have nothing
further to remark, my friends, but
will close with a painful fact. It is
melancholy, but it is too true, that next
door to the Vatican is a large manufactory
for Bologna sausages. (The
excitement becomes intense.) Sometime
after this painful disappearance,
an American gentleman, travelling
through Italy for his health, saw fit to
order a large amount of sausages from
this very factory. Well, the sausages
were sent home; the American gentleman
ordered one of them to be cut.
A slight obstruction opposed the passage
of the knife. It was a small
lump of something wrapped up pretty
tight. The American gentleman with

<!-- page 224 col 2 -->

his own fingers picked the small lump
o' something from the very centre of
the sausage. It was a piece of paper&mdash;he
unrolled it. Brothers and sisters,
it was nothing more than a fragment
of a Tract issued by the Patent-Gospellers;
and headed&mdash;'<i>A Thrust at
Pagan Rome!</i>' Brothers and sisters,
each one of that lot of sausages on
being opened, contained one or more
of such fragments! Brothers and sisters,
those ten men of the crew, those
twenty passengers, that captain, and
that little boy, all had Patent-Gospel
tracts in their pockets when they
were missed! Brothers and sisters, I
will leave you to draw your own conclusions!"</p>

<p>The Rev. Syllaybub Scissors sate
down amid a perfect hurricane of applause.
What the Free Believers
applauded it was difficult to tell.
Whether it was the Pope of Rome,
or the crew, or the passengers, or the
little boy, or the sausage manufactory,
or whether it was the American Gentleman,
so mysteriously held in view,
to this day remains a mystery.</p>

<p>"Missionaries, stand forth!" cried
the Reverend F. A. T. Pyne, rising
statelily behind his bath-tub.</p>

<p>Three young men, with long hair,
very tow-like in hue, stuck behind
their ears, and white cravats around
their necks, stepped slowly forward,
and took their place in front of the
pulpit, crossing their hands very
meekly on their breast, and casting
their eyes, upon a particular nail in
the floor, with a sanctity of look, that
was quite edifying, even to an unconverted
man.</p>

<p>"Abel Stump, Joshua Hoe, Benijah
Baker, are you willing to go abroad

<!-- page 225 col 1 -->

to the Pope of Rome, as Missionaries
sent by the Universal American Patent-Gospel
Association&mdash;" exclaimed
Brother Pyne, in a loud voice with his
fist raised in the air, in a gesture of
indignant menace.</p>

<p>"We <i>air</i>&mdash;" responded three faint
and sickly voices.</p>

<p>"Do you understand your calling?"
continued Brother Pyne in his most
Boanergian voice&mdash;"You are to allow
the Pagan no peace! You are to give
him Tracts as he comes from mass,
you are to present him with a fresh
Bible every Sabbath; you are to hail
him in the street, and tell him that in
America, the Patent-Gospellers are
raising a Buffalo to fight his Bull!
Are you willing to defy the Inquisition
in such a cause. Are you willing to
defy death&mdash;are you willing to be
made up in sausages, in such a cause?
Are you, Brothers, I say?"</p>

<p>"We <i>air!</i>" responded the three
faint and sickly voices.</p>

<p>"Here is a sight for the whole
world to see!" continued the Reverend
F. A. T. Pyne, his eyes dilating, while
his crimson face, looked like the full
moon seen through a distempered
mist&mdash;"Here, standing upon the Rock
of Freedom we tell the Pope of Rome,
that his schemes are defeated, that his
Babylon has fallen! Ha, ha! We
laugh at the Pope of Rome! We tell
him in tones of indignant thunder, that
his grand plan of buying up the state
of Missouri, in order to erect a Papal
Kingdom on American soil, and let
his Bulls loose, to run wild on American
prairies, has fell through&mdash;been
nullified&mdash;and trampled upon with the
ponderous foot of the Universal Patent-Gospel
Association! He would build

<!-- page 225 col 2 -->

a Vatican on the Banks of the Mississippi,
would he? He'd have his
Propaganda, in the State House would
he? Yes, yes, he would have his
College of Cardinals in Faneuil Hall,
would he? He would, but he <i>can't!</i>
We snap our fingers at him! Ha, ha!
Let him jump Jim Crow in his Vatican
at Rome if he likes, but he mus'n't try
to build another St. Peter's on our Soil!
No, no, no! Down with the Pope
say I&mdash;down with the Pope say all!
We'll fight his Bulls with spiritual
weapons, with the Patent-Gospel bowie
knife! We'll crowd our pulpits with
lecturers no matter who they are,
or what they are, or where they come
from! From the prison we welcome
them! From the jail, or the galleys,
or even from the rope of the gibbet&mdash;still,
still, we welcome them! Are
they not brothers? Co-workers with
us? Let them but affirm that they
once were Priests of Rome, let them
but declare they are converted Jesuits,
and with all our hearts, we welcome
them! But they must decry Rome!
Down with Rome, down with the
Pope&mdash;UP with the Bible!</p>

<p>"They must rake up from the
ashes of the past, all the firebrands
ever lighted in the flames of Hell!
All the old books, which show up the
atrocities of Rome, must be republished&mdash;their
contents shouted from the
street-corners, printed on our Patent-Gospel
Press, thundered from our Pulpits&mdash;down
with the Pope of Rome!</p>

<p>"Awake St. Bartholomew, with
your blood and ashes and flame&mdash;we
want you here! Awake bones of the
martyrs; awake sword of the Solemn
League and Covenant! Down with
the Pope of Rome!</p>

<!-- page 226 col 1 -->

<p>"Stir yourselves up in the good
work, brothers and sisters! Let not
your efforts slack! Whenever you
find a deluded follower of the Pope&mdash;teach
him, or her, the error of their
ways! If he is a porter in your employ,
or a drayman, or a common
laborer&mdash;discharge him, I say, wash
your hands of him, bid him <i>go forth!</i>
If she is a seamstress, or a governess,
or a hired girl, especially an Irish
Pagan hired girl&mdash;turn her from your
doors!</p>

<p>"Thus let Pagan Rome be met at
the threshold! Awake Guy Faux,
with your lanthern and faggots,
awake Inquisition with your tortures,
with your fiery furnace, into whose
flames you cast those good Protestants,
Shadrack, Meshack and Abednego&mdash;awake
we want you here!
You must help to witness against
Pagan Rome!</p>

<p>"Down with the Pope and his
Bulls! Down with St. Peter's and the
Vatican! Down with the Priests, and
the Monks and the Nuns, down with
the Sisters of Charity and the Orphans
under their care&mdash;down with them
all! Up with the Patent-Gospellers,
up with the good old doctrine which
John Calvin preached to Servetus
from the window of his chamber,
looking out into the open square of
Geneva&mdash;where that same Servetus,
a rank infidel, was burning&mdash;up with
the good old doctrine, which proclaims
fire and brimstone, the cardinal
points of the belief of the good
Savior Jesus! Down with the Pope&mdash;up
with fire and brimstone; up
with toleration; UP <i>with the Bible!</i>"</p>

<p>How the applause of the Free Believers

<!-- page 226 col 2 -->

and True Repenters, rose up
to the ceiling like the voice of some
huge monster! Thunder was mere
silence in comparison! How the old
ladies rose from their seats in ecstacy,
how the old gentlemen punished the
hard floor with their thick-soled boots!
How meekly the three Missionaries
resumed their seats, how warmly the
brethren, crowding round them, crushed
their fingers with very joy, and almost
dragged their arms from the
sockets, with intense religious feeling!
But when the Reverend Pyne, resuming
his seat, took from his coat
pocket a large white handkerchief
and wiped the perspiration from his
red round face, ah me, that was the
time for the applause! A Quaker
City Theatre, with Fanny Ellsler on
the stage, and all the grey-haired men
in the pit, never raised such a round
of applause as that! Death to the
old Pagan, death to the Pope of
Rome! Up with fire and brimstone,
up with toleration, up with the Bible!</p>

<p>When the excitement was somewhat
subdued, a faint voice was heard
echoing from a far corner of the Lecture
Room, and the light of the rusty
chandelier fell upon the grey hairs of
an old man who trembled nervously
as he spoke.</p>

<p>He stated, in feeble tones, that he
was an American citizen; that his
father had fought in the Revolution.
At Monmouth, Trenton, Germantown
and Brandywine, he had fought under
the banner of George Washington.
The old man's voice trembled as he
spoke this name; and he paused for
a moment to collect his thoughts.</p>

<p>"That's the stuff!" cried the Reverend
F. A. T. Pyne&mdash;"A soldier

<!-- page 227 col 1 -->

under Washington&mdash;let us hear
him!"</p>

<p>"Somethin' against that tarnel
Pagan, no doubt!" cried an old woman,
quite joyously.</p>

<p>"Now let the Wattykin look to
itself!" murmured brother Augustus
Billygoat.</p>

<p>"An incident for my Patent-Gospel
Expositor!" meekly suggested the
Rev. Syllabub Scissors.</p>

<p>"My father fought under Washington&mdash;"
continued the old man, speaking
from that distant corner of the
room, in trembling tones&mdash;"And
though but a mere boy, at that time,
I fought with him! He died in my
arms on the battle-field; his last
words were, God take my soul and
bless brave Washington! Therefore,
brethren, I humbly think, that I have
some small claims to the title of an
American: my life does not, I believe,
contradict the additional claim, which
I make to the title of Protestant
Christian!</p>

<p>"My friends, I ask your attention
to a passing thought, which struck
me while our Reverend Brother was
enchaining you all with his eloquence.
Is there no need of Missionaries for
other purposes than the overthrowing
of Pagan Rome? Do we not
want Missionaries in this our good
city?</p>

<p>"Are there no holes of vice, to be
illumined by the light of God's own
Gospel? Are there no poor, no sick,
no needy? Would not a true physician
first turn his knife to those
cankering sores which gather near
the heart of the patient, ere he proceeded
to bind up wounds or cut off
limbs? Are there no hideous moral

<!-- page 227 col 2 -->

sores to be examined and healed by
the Missionary of Jesus in this our
moral heart of Philadelphia, ere we
cut off the limb of Pagan Rome, or
bind up the wounds of idolatrous Hindoostan?</p>

<p>"Might not the Missionary of Jesus
find room for much well-doing in our
Courts, our Churches, our Streets,
our Homes? Might he not stand
upon the grave of old Stephen Girard
(leaving the Pagan of Rome to his
errors for a little while) and point
to Girard College&mdash;that unfinished
Monument of a foul wrong, done to
ten thousand orphans&mdash;and, as he
pointed, might he not call upon the
God of the fatherless to protect those
same orphans, who were scattered
abroad through the world, in order
that a Corporation might feast and
riot upon old Stephen's money?</p>

<p>"Down with Pagan Rome by all
means, but down with the Paganism
of Protestant Philadelphia!</p>

<p>"And oh, friends, might not the
true Missionary of the cross enter the
thickly-carpeted chambers of some of
our Reverend Pastors, and tell them,
as God will tell them one day, that
they are a blot upon the name of
Jesus! That the seduction of female
innocence is not a light crime to rest
upon the souls of those who administer
God's Sacrament!</p>

<p>"That foul-mouthed temperance in
public&mdash;wine-drinking in private&mdash;the
assailment of private character in the
pulpit&mdash;the destruction of some poor
girl's honor in the parlor&mdash;that bitter
controversy&mdash;violent appeals to excited
mobs, combined with insidious
endeavors to create those very mobs&mdash;that
these are not the characteristics

<!-- page 228 col 1 -->

of God's own Ministers, but rather
the fuel with which the Devil will
kindle a hell for their souls!"</p>

<p>They silenced the old man with a
hurricane of groans.</p>

<p>"A Catholic!" shouted Brother
Pyne&mdash;"A pagan&mdash;A Roman! Hand
him over to the police!"</p>

<p>"To think of his impudence!"
screamed an old woman&mdash;"To come
here an' try to p'ison our minds!
Papist!"</p>

<p>The old man felt himself seized by
the arms, and hands and coat-tail,
all at once. Brother Billygoat forced
his hat over his eyes; Brother Syllabub
Scissors helped to lead him out.
The three Missionaries merely groaned.
To the door, down stairs, into
the street&mdash;old man, soldier of Washington,
son of a soldier, this is your
share of Patent-Gospel charity! Into
the street, and into the dark with him
and his lies! He belongs to Pagan
Rome!</p>

<p>After the old man was dismissed,
the Free Believers composed their
minds in a hymn of pious import;
being three lines to the Pope and one
to the Devil, on the average, through
ten long stanzas; and this finished,
Brother Pyne poured forth his soul in
prayer!</p>

<p>Prayer! Ho, ho! Was that a
fiend's laugh as he heard the mockery
of that prayer ascend in tones of blasphemy
to the very throne of God?
Prayer! Hurrah&mdash;hurrah! Was
that the yell of all the devils gathered
in the shades of death, as they heard
the name of Jesus profaned, and
mocked, and polluted by the hot
breathings of yon round-faced hypocrite?

<!-- page 228 col 2 -->

Prayer! Is this long-drawn
Anathema Marantha, made up of
curses, falsehoods and impious vulgarities,
is this prayer?</p>

<p>Is the whispering of the young mother,
over her first-born, prayer? Is
the trembling supplication of the
father, by the bedside of his dying
daughter, uttered in husky tones with
eyes blinded by tears, is this agony
of a breaking heart, prayer? Are the
holiest feelings of the heart, rising up
from the soul to its God, in the silence
of night, when earth sleeps while
heaven watches its slumbers, are
these warm uprisings of man's better
nature, prayer? Are all these prayer,
and are the whining blasphemies of
yonder smooth-tongued Pander to the
lust of the Bigot, are these loathsome
falsehoods, linked together by a chain
of Scripture phrases, are these prayer?</p>

<p>If this is prayer, then let us shut
the Bible and cry with the madman-atheist
of France&mdash;'There is no God&mdash;Death
is an eternal sleep!' If this
be prayer, then let us blaspheme,
curse, swear, or sell our souls for a
Preacher's hire&mdash;anything but pray!</p>

<p>The Free Believers dispersed as
soon as the howl of Brother Pyne was
over. How the sisters and the brothers
thronged around the Reverend Brother
as, with his cloak wrapped around his
portly form, he hastened from the
room! What pressing of hands, what
picking at his cloak, what glancing
in his face! Old and young, fair and
foul, red lips and grey hairs, all joined
to do the Parson honor! How was
his cold; had the Lord been good to
him lately; had he heard from that
poor, wretched, runaway daughter;

<!-- page 229 col 1 -->

was he blessed in prayer; and did he
not hurt himself by studying so late
at night!</p>

<p>Down stairs, followed by his loving
congregation, Brother Pyne pursued
his way, Brother Billygoat clinging to
his arm, while Brother Scissors,
with the three Missionaries, hung
closely at his heels. The alley was
reached, and in a few moments the
saintly quadruple, stood in the bye-street,
where a carriage waited for
Brother Pyne, with a stout lusty coachman
on the box, wrapped up in an
unknown number of overcoats, with a
broad hat flapping its broken rim over
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Good night, sisters, good night
brothers!" said Brother Pyne, in a
tone of spermaceti smoothness&mdash;"Good
night, my children, good
night!"</p>

<p>The door closed, and the carriage
drove off.</p>

<p>"He goes to his night-long studies,
after the Truth!" cried Brother Scissors,
wiping his nose with the cuff of
his sleeve&mdash;"Let Pagan Rome look
out!"</p>

<p>"Dear heart!" echoed an old lady&mdash;"And
so he studies all night, does
he! A bringin' himself to the grave
with his zeal!"</p>

<p>"The saints and martyrs are no
thing compared to Brother Pyne!"
meekly exclaimed Brother Billygoat,
expectorating violently on an old
lady's bonnet&mdash;"Let Pagan-Rome
look out for its Wattykin; that's all!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile the carriage, containing
the Foe of Pagan Rome, dashed down
the street like mad, the coachman
lashing the horses into perfect fury,
while a poor ragged loafer, gliding

<!-- page 229 col 2 -->

from the sidewalk, crept up behind
the vehicle, and assumed a quiet seat
all to himself, without saying a word
to the holy preacher within, or the
white-coated driver in front.</p>

<p>At the corner of a wide street, the
coachman held up for a single moment.
He tapped the window of the
carriage with the handle of his whip.</p>

<p>"Vich vay?" he shouted in a deep,
hoarse voice.</p>

<p>Down went the carriage window,
and the red round face of Parson Pyne
was thrust out into the full glare of
the gas-lamp on the corner.</p>

<p>"Down town, of course, Simon&mdash;I've
got to visit the sick you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In vich quarter?"</p>

<p>"Monk-Hall!" whispered the
preacher, and then the coachman
cracked his whip, the carriage window
went up, and the carriage rolled
off, while the poor loafer, sitting
behind, chuckled merrily to himself,
and whistled for very glee!</p>

<p>" 'My daddy was a scavenger, and
my mammy sold rags!' Ha, ha, ha!
Hurrah! Down with the Pope and
the Wattykin! Up with the Patent-Gospel,
up with Monk-Hall! Let
Pagan Rome look out for itself&mdash;hurrah!"</p>

<p>CHAPTER FOURTH.</p>

<p class="small">STRANGE VISITORS IN MONK-HALL.</p>

</div>

<p>THE beams of a small lamp of rusty
iron, standing on the table near the
fire, gave a faint and dusky light to
the Doorkeeper's den. Devil-Bug was

<!-- page 230 col 1 -->

seated beside the table, with his elbows
resting on its rough oaken surface,
while his hands grasped his tawny
cheeks, the long finger nails sinking
into the flesh like the talons of an
eagle, and spotting his face with drops
of blood. His teeth were fast clenched,
but his lips, hung apart, shrivelled
with a fixed and grotesque grin; like
the smile of a fiend, frozen into marble.
His thick, matted hair hung over
his protuberant brow, and his solitary
eye, dilated and enlarged to twice its
usual size, glared steadily forward,
with one fixed and unvarying gaze.
The light streamed full in his face,
revealing each hideous feature in stern
and immovable distinctness, while the
outlines of his deformed body, and the
details of the den, were wrapt in a
twilight shadow. In the recess on one
side of the fire, sate the negro Musquito,
his arms crossed, and his head
sunken on his breast, while on the opposite
side of the fire, his companion,
Glow-worm, rested in the same attitude,
and slumbered like some overgrown
animal who has been gorged
with food. Their common costume&mdash;the
red flannel shirt and corduroy
trowsers&mdash;dimly disclosed in the light
seemed to increase the outlines of their
herculean frames, while it gave them
a wild and ruffian-like appearance.</p>

<p>Alone in his den, with his attendant
satellites slumbering on either side,
Devil-Bug sat silent, as though he was
but an uncouth effigy of stone, while
his fingers, digging their talon-like
nails slowly in the flesh of his cheeks,
gave some indications of the terrible
agony which was eating through his
soul. He had sate thus silent and

<!-- page 230 col 2 -->

motionless for the space of an hour,
when the small door, leading into the
hall of the mansion, was softly opened,
and our friend Brick-Top, clad in
his array of rags, came treading
stealthily into the Doorkeeper's den.</p>

<p>He started at the sight of Devil-Bug
but in a moment advanced, and laid
his hand upon the Doorkeeper's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"You're a purty old cove, ain't ye,
now? To run off, and leave a feller
in the lurch! The old 'ooman's dead
body up stairs and the poleese below!
Pack me up in a <i>see</i>-gar box, somebody,
and bury me in a common for
a werry infant, arter that!"</p>

<p>"Ha! What brings you here?"
cried Devil-Bug, starting from his reverie&mdash;"Where
did you leave the Jew?
And the chest o' gold&mdash;hey, hey?"</p>

<p>"What brings me here? Business
o' course! You see it ain't pleasant
to have the poleese' inquirin arter yer
health, 'specially when an old woman's
been knocked in the head, by
some 'indewidooals at present unknown.'
So I came to the Pawn-broker's&mdash;went
down stairs and along
the vault, and then up stairs again&mdash;you
know the way. Here I am, and
there you are, and we're both a pair
o' beauties for Cherry Hill! Brick-Top
and Devil-Bug&mdash;hurray!"</p>

<p>"Where did you leave the Jew?"
said Devil-Bug with a fierce scowl as
he struck his fist against the table&mdash;"And
the chest o' gold&mdash;hey, hey?"</p>

<p>"Young man does yer mother
know yer out? Venever ye meet a
werry green young genelman, as
doesn't know what huckleberries is
compared with persimmins, then axe

<!-- page 231 col 1 -->

him sich a question! I don't know
nothin' 'bout the Jew, no more nor
yesself!"</p>

<p>"S-h-ew!" whispered Devil-Bug
with a sudden start as he motioned his
companion to be silent&mdash;"S-h-ew!
Don't ye see that feller a lay in on the
floor with his jaw bruk and his tongue
out?"</p>

<p>"Cussed if I do!"</p>

<p>"Nor the old woman, with the
brains oozing out from the holler
skull?"</p>

<p>"Not the least circumstance!"</p>

<p>"S-h-ew! Don't ye hear that feller
groan? Look how he wriggles
there&mdash;a-twistin' and twistin' like a
snake, and his tongue rollin' out all
the while! And the old woman&mdash;don't
ye see her? I tell you man,
she's there&mdash;there&mdash;right between us
on the floor; her holler skull layin' at
my werry feet, and her long grey
hair, dabblin' in her blood! Don't
see her indeed! He! He!" and he
smiled ghastlily&mdash;"Why man, I tell
ye, I can count the blood-drops as
they fall&mdash;patter&mdash;patter&mdash;from the
holler skull to the floor!"</p>

<p>And the solitary eye of Devil-Bug
glared wildly from the shadow of his
brow, while the sweat, cold and clammy,
stood out on his forehead and
trickled down his swarthy face.</p>

<p>"And not to git the chest o' doubloons
arter all! Kin ye read feller,
I say kin ye read?" he exclaimed in
a fierce tone, as he laid his hand on
Brick-Top's arm&mdash;"Or are ye a stupid
jackass as don't know nothin'?"</p>

<p>"Shut me up in a coal mine all
my life, and make me chaw dirt for a
livin'! Kin I read? I wish my daddy
could hear you say that! He'd

<!-- page 231 col 2 -->

show my school bills, old chap, with
a wengeance to ye!"</p>

<p>"Here's a package o' papers, which
I picked up on the stairs o' th' widow's
house. Sit down on t'other side o' th'
table and read 'em to me!"</p>

<p>Brick-Top sate down on one side of
the table, while Devil-Bug resumed
his seat opposite.</p>

<p>"Papers!" cried Brick-Top pulling
his lank red hair down over his brows&mdash;"Egad!"
he muttered to himself&mdash;"The
very packet entrusted to me by
Livingstone this morning! The seal
broken, too!"</p>

<p>"Read, will ye? And mind yer
eye feller! If I ketch you playin' the
fool with me, and readin' any stuff
what isn't there, I'll make no bones of
hurtin' your body so no doctors won't
buy ye arter yer a corpse!"</p>

<p>"Talk that way to the Wolunteers,
will ye? Howsomever, here goes into
the doc-y-ments&mdash;"</p>

<p>In a low toned voice, still marked
by his vagabond accent, Brick-Top
began to read the contents of the
package.</p>

<p>At first Devil-Bug leaned over the
table with a look of the deepest interest,
but soon the details of the package
seemed to tire him, and he leaned
listlessly to one side, with his eye
fixed vacantly upon the ceiling. Brick-Top
read on. A name attracted Devil-Bug's
attention, and then a date, and
an incident. He leaned over the table,
his solitary eye blazing with the most
intense interest.</p>

<p>"Look here, youssir&mdash;you ain't
a-foolin' me are ye? <i>Ellen</i>&mdash;did ye
say!"</p>

<p>"The werry same," replied Brick-Top
burying his face in the unrolled

<!-- page 232 col 1 -->

package. His attention also seemed
rivetted to the paper and its contents,
for his glittering and snake-like eye
grew more brilliant in its glance,
while the outlines of his countenance
became fixed and compressed. Brick-Top
pulled his red hair farther over
his brow, until it almost concealed his
eyes, and then resumed the reading
of the paper.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug listened with every power
of his soul, enchained by an overwhelming
interest. His solitary eye,
dilated and flashed with excitement,
and the nails of his talon-like fingers
were thrust into his tawny cheeks
with a movement of involuntary agitation.</p>

<p>"<i>Christmas Eve?</i>" he echoed, repeating
the words of the Manuscript
as they fell from the lips of the reader&mdash;"<i>Christmas
Eve, Eighteen hundred
and twenty four?</i> Hallo, youssir?
Is them the words?"</p>

<p>"The werry same!" replied Brick-Top
raising the paper before his face&mdash;"Left
her mother's house on that
date&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Read on will ye? Don't ye see
how I'm a-quiverin'? I want to know
the rest&mdash;read on!"</p>

<p>Brick-Top again turned his attention
to the Manuscript. Devil-Bug was
utterly absorbed in its details. He
held his very breath, as he drank in
each word, and date and incident.</p>

<p>"<i>The second child died, did it?"</i>
he shrieked, starting wildly from his
seat&mdash;"Now look here feller, if you're
got the feelin's of a common human
bein' don't make a fool o' me! Read
it agin&mdash;be sure that it's the second
child; jist be sure o' that!"</p>

<p>"The second child born Christmas

<!-- page 232 col 2 -->

Eve, Eighteen hundred and
twenty four&mdash;" exclaimed Brick-Top
reading from the Manuscript, while a
slight tremor was observable in his
voice.</p>

<p>"That's the date, too, that's the
date!" cried Devil-Bug in a voice of
the deepest agitation&mdash;"Look here
feller, d'ye see that arm? The night
arter she left this house, I got a sailor-chap
to print this here with Injin ink."</p>

<p>And as he spoke, Devil-Bug bared
his right arm, and thrust it forward
into the full glare of the light. Brick-Top
gazed upon it in surprise. On its
brawny skin, in rough characters,
was punctured, this brief name and
date&mdash;"CHRISTMAS EVE&mdash;1825&mdash;ELLEN."</p>

<p>"And so ye know'd her did ye?"
exclaimed Brick-Top gazing in Devil-Bug's
face with a piercing glance,
while his lip trembled with some unknown
emotion&mdash;"Werry singular
that!"</p>

<p>"Know'd her?" responded Devil-Bug
in a tone of sudden anger&mdash;"Don't
axe no questions feller, but
read on!"</p>

<p>Brick-Top again resumed the Manuscript.
A name, once more started
Devil-Bug from his feet.</p>

<p>"Dick Baltzar?" he echoed&mdash;"Sure
that's the name?"</p>

<p>"The werry same. Here it is&mdash;'<i>The
second child, was buried by a
man named Dick Baltzar, who with
his wife, resided in the widow's
house. The first child</i>&mdash;' howsomever
let me read on!"</p>

<p>The Manuscript drew near its close.
His brows woven in frown, his teeth
clenched, his hands clutching his
cheeks with a convulsive grasp, Devil-Bug

<!-- page 233 col 1 -->

listened to the closing words with
breathless interest.</p>

<p>"The whole of his fortune?"
echoed Devil-Bug repeating the words
of the Manuscript&mdash;"Luke Harvey
entrusted with the commission? Hey,
hey? Is that it?"</p>

<p>Brick-Top nodded, but said nothing.
Well was it for him, that Devil-Bug
occupied with his own strange thoughts,
had no eye for his companion's demeanor.
A tear stole from Brick-Top's
eyelid and rolled down his
freckled face. His hand trembled as
he grasped the Manuscript, and his
lip quivered with a tremulous motion.</p>

<p>"Luke Harvey!" muttered Devil-Bug&mdash;"He's
a wild fellow, and one
of the devil's disciples who hold their
meetings in this house! A purty chap
to have sich a matter in his charge!
He'll be here sometime to-night, and
I'll have a talk with him! Gi'me that
paper&mdash;will ye?"</p>

<p>"I say, old feller, come now and
uncork this mystery! Let a body
know all about it&mdash;that's a conwivial
old devil!"</p>

<p>Devil-Bug turned toward him with
a lowering brow, but as he turned a
knock was heard at the front door.</p>

<p>"Dig off&mdash;<i>feller!</i>" said Devil-Bug,
with great emphasis&mdash;" 'Tain't for sich
as you to know what quality comes
to this house! Dig, I say!"</p>

<p>Brick-Top lounged lazily toward
the doorway of the mansion-hall,
while Devil-Bug, unbarring the front
door, gazed through the crevices of
the green blinds upon the form of the
new-comer.</p>

<p>"Who's there?"</p>

<p>"Monk Baltzar&mdash;" answered an
assumed and artificial voice.</p>

<!-- page 233 col 2 -->

<p>"What had you for dinner to-day?"
asked Devil-Bug, repeating the
first part of the countersign of Monk-Hall.</p>

<p>"Fire and Brimstone!" answered
the voice.</p>

<p>"Come in!" said Devil-Bug&mdash;"All
right! The gal's up stairs in the
room&mdash;I'll be up d'rectly!"</p>

<p>And as he spoke the Reverend
Parson Pyne strode silently across
the floor of the den, and with his face
muffled in the folds of his cloak,
passed through the doorway, and
along the hall, and up the stairs; and
in a moment disappeared into one of
the rooms on the right side of the
massive staircase, on the second floor
of the mansion. As he disappeared,
a tall figure rose upward from the
darkness, which hung round the bannisters
of the staircase near the floor.</p>

<p>"Parson, I think I've tracked you
to some purpose!" said a deep-toned
voice&mdash;"The girl <i>your</i> daughter and
you in Monk-Hall! I'll drop Brick-Top
for a little while and assume Luke
Harvey again, in order to be ready
for all accidents! My game is a desperate
one, but I'll play it with a cool
head and firm hand!"</p>

<p>With these words he disappeared
into the door of Luke Harvey's room;
and in a moment the sound of the
key, turning in the lock, echoed faintly
round the hall.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Devil-Bug, standing near
the table, in the centre of his den, with
his arms crossed over his breast and
his right hand grasping Livingstone's
mysterious packet, seemed utterly absorbed
in the contemplation of the
disclosures which it had revealed.</p>

<p>The sound of voices, mingling confusedly

<!-- page 234 col 1 -->

together, came echoing suddenly
from the stairway leading to the
Banquet-Room of Monk-Hall. And
then a rude burst of laughter, resounded
through the hall, mingled with the
hurried tramp of footsteps.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! And so you drugged
the brother with opium!" exclaimed a
voice familiar to the reader&mdash;"That
was an odd mistake of mine, Gus,
about the fellow's name!"</p>

<p>"To think Silly should introduce
him to you by the name of Byrnewood!"
cried another voice&mdash;"And
then&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;the Bridal scene!
Oh Lord, that was too good, wasn't
it, Gus!"</p>

<p>"Very good, no doubt, very good,
gentlemen&mdash;" exclaimed a third voice&mdash;"But
there are some jokes which
cost a mint of money. I rather
suspect that this amusing adventure
is one of the costly class!"</p>

<p>Ere the words had ceased to echo
in the air, Lorrimer, followed by
Petriken and Mutchins, lounged into
the Doorkeeper's den. Their faces
was slightly flushed by the kisses of
that long-necked giant, the champagne
bottle, and their entrance into Devil-Bug's
private parlor, was heralded
by clouds of smoke issuing from the
segars which the trio carried between
their lips.</p>

<p>"Well, boys&mdash;" cried Petriken,
moving toward the door&mdash;"Let's out
and have a night of it! My Western
Hem. was put to press to-day, and so
I'm free for a fortnight! D'ye see
my last Hem., Mutchins?"</p>

<p>"Never, except on one occasion,
after a long night's carouse, when my
temples were bursting with the effects
of the champagne. I wanted to sleep

<!-- page 234 col 2 -->

and couldn't for the life of me. However,
happening to pick up a copy of
the Western Hem. with 'Autumn, a
Homologue: by S. J. Petriken,' I fell
into a gentle doze after the first twenty
lines, and slept for thirty-eight hours,
as I'm a living sinner! Is your Mag.
printed near a laud'num factory,
Silly?"</p>

<p>"Pshaw! You ought to see the
last number! Two engravings, one
tragic, one comic! Tragic&mdash;the death
o' Cock Robin, with an illustrative
piece o' poetry, by my friend Deacon
Shewbrush! Comic&mdash;Nigger church
on fire, with the Sheriff and Court
looking on, to see that it is done in
an effective manner.* Good number,
that!"</p>

<p class="small">[*See the charge of a certain Judge, in
which he instructs the Grand Jury to present
a certain Hall as a nuisance, because it was
threatened by a mob, and, therefore, it endangered
the surrounding property. It was
owned and used by Negroes for benevolent
purposes. This latter fact furnishes sufficient
apology for any act of outrage in a city where
Pennsylvania Hall was burnt by the whole
population, because the object for which it
was built happened to be unpopular.]</p>

<p>"Come on, fellows!" exclaimed
Lorrimer, who had been gazing
quietly at Devil-Bug, as he stood unconscious
of their presence&mdash;"Let us
out, and make a night of it!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, a hand was laid upon
his shoulder, and Long-haired Bess
stood before him, her jet-black tresses
hanging dishevelled along her white
neck, while the peculiar brilliancy of
her eyes, with the dark circle of discolored
flesh beneath each eye, gave
indications of deep and powerful agitation.</p>

<p>"Well, Bessie, what's the matter

<!-- page 235 col 1 -->

now? How is the girl, that is to
say, how is Mary?"</p>

<p>"She has lain unconscious all day
long, until within a few minutes past"&mdash;answered
Bess, in a low-toned voice&mdash;"She
has now recovered her reason.
She does nothing but wring her
hands as she paces up and down the
room; nothing but wring her hands
and shriek your name. Lorrimer,
you had better see this girl before you
leave the house&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why the fact is, Bessie, I don't
see the necessity of the thing"&mdash;answered
Lorrimer, moving towards
the door&mdash;"Quiet her, Bessie, quiet
her! I will see her to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"Have you a man's heart within
your bosom?" said Bess, with a flashing
glance of her dark eyes&mdash;"Can
you refuse this request? Do what
ye will with Byrnewood, but for the
sake of your own self-regard, do not
refuse this request! She is dishonored,
Lorrimer, but who was the cause
of her dishonor? Do not refuse to
look upon the ruin which has followed
your crime!"</p>

<p>"Not to-night, Bessie, not to-night&mdash;"
cried Lorrimer, moving toward
the door&mdash;"Any time but to-night;
as for Byrnewood&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That 'ere patient is in the hands
of the Doctor&mdash;" exclaimed Devil-Bug,
advancing. "I give him a leetle
opium to begin with; arter a-while I'll
<i>per</i>-scribe somethin' more coolin'&mdash;a
leetle hard steel for instance. Vonders
how that 'ill vork?"</p>

<p>As he spoke, Lorrimer and his
companions disappeared through the
front door, with a loud burst of laughter.</p>

<p>"He is gone!" cried Bess, folding

<!-- page 235 col 2 -->

her arms across her bosom&mdash;"God
of Heaven! The shriek of that ruined
girl is ever in my ears, its accents of
despair freezing my soul with a horror
I never felt before! And the brother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I tell ye, Bessie, I'll tend to him!"
cried Devil-Bug, with his hideous grin&mdash;"Go
up stairs an' tend to the female
wictim, my dear, go along my
duck. I think I hear your mammy
callin' for you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bess looked at him with a glance
of scorn, and then her deep black eyes
flashed with an expression whose
awful meaning thrilled him to the
very soul.</p>

<p>"Don't you see the corse at your
side?" she shrieked, as she stood in
the doorway&mdash;"Ha! Ha! Ha! There
is evil in store for you, Devil-Bug,
evil, I say, and doom and death!
Hark! hark! Don't you hear <i>him</i>&mdash;"
and she pointed to the floor&mdash;"Hark
how he groans!"</p>

<p>And she was gone. Her wild shriek
rang like a death-knell in Devil-Bug's
ears.</p>

<p>"That gal is a born devil&mdash;" he
said, in a whisper, as he wiped the
cold sweat from his forehead&mdash;"Ha!
There's the feller agin&mdash;his jaw broke,
and his tongue lollin' out! Ha! And
the old woman too; her holler skull
droppin' blood on the floor! But
I'll not be troubled this way much
longer&mdash;" a ghastly smile crossed
visage&mdash;"It seems to me I've got to
wade through blood up to my neck!
I'm only ankle-deep jist now&mdash;arter
a while I'll swim in blood, I'll float, I
tell ye I'll float. As to that Byrnewood&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door.

<!-- page 236 col 1 -->

Musquito, rising from his slumber,
slowly opened the inner door and demanded
the watchword of the new-comer.
It was given in a faint voice,
and in a moment the stranger entered
the den. He was a young man with
a figure somewhat below the middle
height, whose elegance of shape and
beauty of proportion, was disclosed to
every advantage, as his sweeping
black cloak fell carelessly back on his
shoulders, its collar of fur, almost
concealed by the thick ringlets of jet-black
hair, which swept along the fair
face of the stranger. It was, indeed,
a fair face, almost effeminate in its
regularity of feature, while its extreme
pallor gave additional effect to the
brilliancy of two large black eyes,
whose glance was full of fire and expression.
A small velvet cap placed
jauntily on the centre of his head,
amid a profusion of black curls which
fell waving over his fair brow, as well
as along his face and down to his
neck, gave an air of saucy daring to
the stranger, which won Devil-Bug's
good opinion for him at first sight.
His form, remarkable for its effeminate
beauty of shape, was enveloped
in a close-fitting black frock coat, buttoned
tightly over the breast, with its
dark hue relieved by a large white
shirt collar that fell aside from the
fair throat of the stranger.</p>

<p>"Well, young slim-waist, who are
ye, and what d'ye want here?" said
Devil-Bug, more from his habitual
taste for sarcasm than from any positive
dislike to the stranger&mdash;"You're
not one of the Monks, I perceive.
How did ye git hold o' th' watchword?"</p>

<p>"Your name is Abijah K. Jones?"

<!-- page 236 col 2 -->

said the stranger, in a tone which was
evidently assumed.</p>

<p>" 'Tain't that no more!" cried the
Doorkeeper, with a look of mocking
glee&mdash;"Devil-Bug forever! While
there's strength in these arms to
strike or to kill, call me Devil-Bug,
and I'm your man!"</p>

<p>The stranger quietly seated himself
beside the table, and gathering the
cloak around his slender form, carelessly
tossed his dark ringlets over
his brow and looked in the face of
Devil-Bug with a long and penetrating
glance.</p>

<p>"Portr'it painter, I s'pose?" said
Devil-Bug, with a grin&mdash;"Wants to
put my phizzog in the pictur' winders."</p>

<p>"You know a man named Luke
Harvey&mdash;" said the stranger in a deep
voice widely different from the careless
tone, which he had assumed at
first.</p>

<p>"Well, I do, boss. But fust of all,
who are <i>you!</i> How did ye git hold o'
that watchword?"</p>

<p>"No matter about my name&mdash;"
answered the stranger&mdash;"The watchword
of Monk-Hall, was given to me
by one of the Monks. To the point&mdash;You
know a man named Luke Harvey.
He will be in this house, by
three o'clock to-morrow morning. I
hate him, and he must die!"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! You are a <i>han'some</i>
copy o' Devil-Bug! Ha, ha! How
your eyes sparkle, how your teeth
grit agin one another! 'You hate him
and he must die!' Quite short&mdash;ha,
ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"Kill him, for me, kill him by the
pistol or the knife, by fire or by the
sword, any way you like, kill him

<!-- page 237 col 1 -->

this night, and I'll make a rich man
of you! There is gold for you, as an
earnest of your future reward."</p>

<p>"Right fat purse, this! How your
chest swells underneath that cloak,
and your eyes; one could light a
<i>see</i>-gar at 'em!"</p>

<p>"This Luke Harvey carries a ring
on the third finger of his left hand.
Its shape is peculiar, and it bears a
name, engraven on the inner side.
This ring was given him by his ladye-love
long, long ago: he values it, as
his life, and will not part with it save
with his life. I will wait in a secret
chamber of this house until daybreak.
Bring me this ring, before the dawn
of day, and I will reward you, with
gold sufficient to buy you ten thousand
pardons, from the hand of justice&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or a seat in Congress, or a place
on the Bench, among them big chaps
in court! I vonders how that 'ud vork?
Devil-Bug in Congress, makin' laws?
Or Judge Devil-Bug&mdash;ho! ho! ho!
on the bench a-sentencin' little boys to
Cherry Hill for stealin' nose-wipers!"</p>

<p>"Do you consent?" said the stranger,
gathering his cloak more closely
around his form&mdash;"Is it a bargain?"</p>

<p>His eyes, so dark in their hue and
piercing in their gaze, grew alive
with a clear and flashing light, that
spoke the settled resolve of a fearless
soul. A deep flush mantled over his
face, and his lips were firmly compressed,
while, beneath the thick curls
which fell over his forehead, you
might discover the settled frown which
darkened his brows, so regular and
arching in their outline. His breath
came thick and gaspingly, and you
might discern the throbbings which

<!-- page 237 col 2 -->

agitated his chest, through the heavy
folds of his cloak.</p>

<p>"Consent? Ha, ha! S'pose I should
pocket this 'ere money and then laugh
in your face?"</p>

<p>"You would lose the reward
which is in store for you&mdash;" drily responded
the stranger.</p>

<p>"That reward is about your slim-waisted
body? S'pose I take it from
you, and turn you from my doors with
a flea in yer ears?"</p>

<p>"You dare not&mdash;" said the stranger,
throwing his cloak back on his
shoulders, and displaying a pistol in
either hand&mdash;"One word of insolence,
one sign of violence, and you die!"</p>

<p>"Pluck, good pluck! Ha, ha, ha!"
laughed Devil-Bug&mdash;"Good pluck for
a slim waist, good pluck for a heaving
bosom, ha, ha, ha! Stranger, push
aside your curls, will ye? What 'ill
ye bet I can't tell your name?"</p>

<p>"My name!" cried the stranger,
with a sudden start, as he hurriedly
gathered the folds of his cloak around
his handsome form. "My name&mdash;What
know you of my name?"</p>

<p>"Your name is&mdash;" Devil-Bug began,
in a slow and deliberate voice.
He ended the sentence by a quick
whisper which he hissed in the stranger's
ears, as he leaned over the table,
with his head thrown forward until it
well-nigh touched the face of the listener.</p>

<p>But we must depict a scene which
occurred one hour before this incident
of our Revelations.</p>

<!-- page 238 col 1 -->

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br/>

<p>CHAPTER FIFTH.</p>

<p class="small">DORA AND FITZ-COWLES.</p>

</div>

<p>WE open this scene with a picture.&mdash;Kneeling
on the carpet of a princely
chamber, a man of some thirty years
and more supports the insensible form
of a lovely woman in his arms. The
dim light of a massive chandelier
illumines the scene. The dark-hued
face of the man, marked by massive
features, his stiff black hair descending
to his neck in heavy curls, his
well-proportioned form clad in a black
frock coat, all combined furnish an effective
contrast to the careless loveliness
of the woman, her fair-hued face
turned upward to the light, her long
and glossy hair, falling in tresses of
jet along her shoulders white as snow,
while a night-gown of azure silk,
gathering round her form, so swelling,
so lithe and so voluptuous in its every
outline, in negligent folds falls gently
aside from her neck, and reveals a
glimpse of her bosom, slowly heaving
into view.</p>

<p>A dark and ill-omened smile rests
upon the lip of the man, as he surveys
the beauty of the insensible woman,
while a gentle flush, tinting her cheeks,
and warming over her bosom, betrays
her return to consciousness. The minor
details of the scene, tell the story
of the picture. In her extended hand,
she grasps a letter, with a convulsive
grasp like that of death. His hat and
cane and gloves, flung carelessly on
the carpet, his cloak thrown over a
chair, and the door of the chamber,
hanging wide open, all tell the story
of his sudden entrance and his surprise.
The background of the scene is supplied

<!-- page 238 col 2 -->

by the furniture and the crimson-hangings
of the chamber, varied by
pictures in massive frames, and mellowed
into gentle twilight by the dim
beams of the chandelier. Altogether,
the picture is an effective one, worthy
the genius of an artist who has a soul
to feel, and a hand to execute; like
Darley, for instance, whose pencil is a
mine of unwrought gold.</p>

<p>"A lovely woman, by Jove!&mdash;"
muttered Fitz-Cowles&mdash;"And a deep
one! Passions like a volcano, and a
soul fearless as the fiend himself! I
must take care that she does not out-devil
me!"</p>

<p>"Is <i>he</i> gone?" Dora exclaimed
in a whisper, as she slowly unclosed
her eyes&mdash;"Ha! Fitz-Cowles! Then
you know, all?" and half-rising from
her prostrate position she gazed in his
face, with a look of the most intense
anxiety.</p>

<p>"<i>All</i>&mdash;Dora?" echoed Fitz-Cowles
with a look of vacant surprise&mdash;"What
mean you?"</p>

<p>As he spoke, he gently assisted her
to rise from the floor.</p>

<p>"Know you this letter?" she exclaimed,
in a whisper, as she threw
herself in the rocking-chair, and placed
the letter in his hands.</p>

<p>"Your letter to me!" cried Fitz-
Cowles, with a start of surprise&mdash;"I
lost it from my pocket-book, sometime
yesterday. How fortunate for us both
that you found it!"</p>

<p>"Luke Harvey found it!" exclaimed
Dora, in a slow and deliberate tone,
as she leaned over the table&mdash;"And
Luke Harvey holds us in his power!
A single word from his lips, and our
secret is known to Livingstone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Luke Harvey!" exclaimed Fitz-Cowles,

<!-- page 239 col 1 -->

recovering from the stunning
shock of surprise which had thrilled
his very soul, as Dora made the momentous
disclosure&mdash;"And he was
here and threatened you, Dora?"</p>

<p>"Not only threatened me, but
assailed me with deliberate and galling
insult. It is but five minutes
since he left the room. We stand
upon the edge of an awful precipice,
Algernon; already it crumbles beneath
our feet! A word from Luke,
and our plans are overshadowed by
utter ruin&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He visits Monk-Hall to-night!"
exclaimed Fitz-Cowles, with his finger
to his lip, in an absent tone&mdash;"Visits
Monk-Hall with our secret in his
possession. A single blow, and he
were silent forever!"</p>

<p>"That blow must be stricken!"
exclaimed Dora, and a deadly light
flashed from her dark eyes as she
spoke. "Luke once silenced, we are
safe! To-morrow morning, Livingstone
and myself leave town for
Hawkewood. To-morrow evening, Livingstone
will have to return to town
on business, and after he has set out
on his return, you will arrive at
Hawkewood in the secrecy of night.
We can then arrange matters for our
flight or otherwise&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My plan is a plain and a clear
one. After Livingstone has set out
on his return to the Quaker City, I
will arrive at Hawkewood, and then,
mounted on fleet steeds, with suitable
disguises, we will leave the country
mansion together; and riding all night
overtake the New York cars near
Burlington. It is then but half a
day's journey to New York; and the
steamer sails in the beginning of next

<!-- page 239 col 2 -->

week. This is a straightforward
plan, Dora, and we would both do
well to adopt it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have other plans which may
essentially alter our arrangements&mdash;"
said Dora, in a deep and meaning
whisper, with that same deadly glance
of her eyes&mdash;"However, Algernon,
do not fail to meet me at Hawkewood
to-morrow night. But what folly is
this! While we lay plans for our
flight, Luke Harvey is telling Livingstone
the story of his wife's guilt and
his dishonor!"</p>

<p>"This Harvey seems to hate you,
Dora&mdash;" began Fitz-Cowles, aloud,
but he finished the sentence by a
muttered whisper&mdash;"By Jove! He
is on my track also! I learn from
that Buzby Poodle&mdash;whom I have
been forced to buy&mdash;that Harvey was
dogging the Jew's heels to-day! That
same Luke has a spiteful black eye!"</p>

<p>"Hate me!" echoed Dora "Ha,
ha, ha! To tell you the truth, Fitz-Cowles,
he was once a lover of mine.
I rejected the poor fellow, he has exchanged
his love for spite, and now
would sell his soul to ruin me! He
must be silenced, Fitz-Cowles!"</p>

<p>She leaned over the table, fixing her
dark eyes with a meaning glance
upon the face of her paramour. Fitz-Cowles
involuntarily averted his eyes,
and shaded his brow with his upraised
hand. Dora gazed upon him
silently and sternly for a single moment,
and then laid her fair white
hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>"He must be silenced!" she repeated
in that same deep whisper.</p>

<p>"The Jew is <i>safe</i> by this time; I
have nothing to fear from that quarter!"
muttered Fitz-Cowles. "Why

<!-- page 240 col 1 -->

the fact is, Dora, I hardly think the
man would have showed you this letter
had he meant to betray you. He
will attend the banquet in Monk-Hall
to-night, and consequently cannot see
Livingstone before to-morrow. By-the-bye,
where is the old fellow?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Livingstone sent me word by
the servant that matters of pressing
business would detain him at the
counting house all night, until the
hour of our departure to-morrow
morning. To be plain with you,
Algernon, I do not feel safe while
this man Harvey lives with the power
of mischief at his control. Can
you think of no plan to secure his
<i>silence?</i>"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut! He is not worth our
notice, Dora&mdash;" exclaimed Fitz-Cowles,
resuming his hat and cane,
and moving towards the door. "Let
him take his own course. He is too
pitiable a thing to cause one solitary
fear. By-the-bye, you must excuse
me, Dora&mdash;I left a friend waiting in
the parlor down stairs. Remember,
Dora, to-morrow night we meet at
Hawkewood&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My disguise is safe in the next
room," exclaimed Dora, assuming a
careless and languid manner. "By-the-bye,
Fitz-Cowles, how does your
Club manage Monk-Hall? Are you
assured of the silence of your subordinate?
Now if any person who has
money to clear his way can enter the
mansion, I would not give a straw for
the secrecy of the place&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! You women are so
curious!" laughed Fitz-Cowles&mdash;"Anybody
enter the Hall? Nonsense!
No one can enter without
the password, which is changed by

<!-- page 240 col 2 -->

the Abbot every night. Old Devil
Bug would murder the man who attempted
an entrance without the
secret word. Last night I gave out
the password for to-night. 'Fire and
brimstone'&mdash;you know? Tart and
expressive, Dora!"</p>

<p>" 'Fire and brimstone!' " echoed
Dora, rising from her chair&mdash;"And
this Jones, or Devil-Bug, is a desperate
sort of man: is he not? Something
of the cut-throat and the bravo?"</p>

<p>"By Jove! I should not like to
tempt his cut-throat skill! But really,
Dora, my friend down stairs is growing
impatient. Remember, Dora&mdash;"
and he made a slight bow&mdash;"Hawkewood,
Dora, to-morrow night!"</p>

<p>He closed the door, and the merchant's
wife was alone.</p>

<p>She stood silent and motionless,
with her arms folded across her breast,
while her dark hair hung clustering
over the fair bosom, now rising in the
light with the impulse of a dark and
terrible thought. Her eyes, dark and
lustrous as they were at other times,
were now almost hidden by her compressed
brows, while they shot forth
a dead and glassy light, which indicated
a mind buried in itself, as it
called up its most fearful elements, to
nerve it for the accomplishment of a
desperate and appalling deed.</p>

<p>"My name whispered through all
the town with epithets of scorn and
contempt? In the parlor, the saloon,
and the theatre? And then the daily
Journals, who fatten on the garbage
of private discord, will parade in their
loathsome columns the disgrace of
Livingstone, the guilt and degradation
of his wife! My name will become
another word for pollution and dishonor!

<!-- page 241 col 1 -->

Shall this be? Never&mdash;by
all the energies of a soul, which has
a woman's passion without her fear,
<i>never!</i></p>

<p>"The deed which I contemplate is
most appalling! It requires a firm
soul, and a heart which shrinks not
at the sight of blood! It perils a
world to gain a world! But what of
that? A sure eye and a firm footstep
may guide the traveller, unharmed,
along the edge of awful chasms,
which yawn to engulph him, and
echo his tread with the sound of
crumbling rocks! What cares he for
the death that reaches forth its arms
to grasp him, so that he can escape
by a hair's-breadth from its clutches?</p>

<p>"My soul is resolved! Before the
dawn of day, Dora, the Cobbler's
grand-daughter&mdash;ha, ha, ha&mdash;will fear
no living witness of her guilt! And
to-morrow, to-morrow&mdash;Catharine De
Medicis must&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;must
clothe these young limbs with a
widow's weeds!"</p>

<p>These words uttered, she pushed
aside the crimson hangings, and disappeared
into the next chamber, with
a single exclamation.</p>

<p>"The disguise&mdash;" she murmured&mdash;"The
disguise which Fitz-Cowles
prepared for our flight, is safe in this
chest!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, passing down the stairs,
Fitz-Cowles was saluted by his companion,
who stood waiting in the
hall, under the light of the hanging
lamp.</p>

<p>"Cool my blood with a julap!" exclaimed
the indomitable Major Rappahannock
Mulhill, as he stood picking
his teeth with a large bowie knife&mdash;"But

<!-- page 241 col 2 -->

it's too bad to keep a fellow
waiting in this way! I say, Colonel,
did you find old Livingstone in? No?
Then you won the bet!"</p>

<p>"I told you not to bet, but you
would!" replied Fitz-Cowles, twirling
his cane with a <i>nonchalance</i> air&mdash;"You
wagered a cool thousand that I
would find Livingstone up stairs!
How deuced foolish in you! I never
saw such a fellow for betting; never,
by Jove! By-the-bye, Major, there's
a fire in the parlor, let's walk in and
settle the bet."</p>

<p>"Oh, we bloods down south are
awful chaps to bet, <i>awe</i>-ful!" replied
Rappahannock, as his round face
assumed an expression of deep solemnity&mdash;"Why
Fitz, my boy, I recollect
one occasion, when the head of a
large family was buried&mdash;it was my
father&mdash;that bets were made with all
the heirs with regard to the length of
the Parson's sermon! The odds ran
strong on an hour and a half. Bets
were freely offered, ten to one, that the
Parson would not get done in two
hours. I booked them all. The Parson,
strong winded chap as he was,
broke down after the first hour, and
they handed the bets to me over the
old man's grave&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let us walk into the front parlor,"
exclaimed Fitz-Cowles, opening
the door.</p>

<p>"But the most singular fact of all
was, that we had to use the old man's
coffin as a writing desk, on which to
settle the amount of the various bets.
The Parson waited till we had finished.
One fellow was mean enough to
skulk out of his bet; I licked him, and
we had a row over the grave&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, Major, your bet was a

<!-- page 242 col 1 -->

thousand, was it not?" coolly interrupted
Fitz-Cowles, opening his pocket-book,
as if to receive the money.</p>

<p>"We had a row over the grave.
You'd hardly believe it, Colonel, but
fifteen funerals sprung from that very
circumstance. Why the amount of
Bowie knives and pistols which were
used in that fight may be estimated,
when you are informed that a dev'lish
enterprising blacksmith in the vicinity
made horseshoes from the fragments
for six months afterwards. 'The
Mulhill funeral horseshoes' were all
the go! Cool me with a julap,
by&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your bet was a thousand dollars"&mdash;said
Fitz-Cowles, quite pointedly,
as he displayed the pocket-book in
his right hand.</p>

<p>"Oh my dear fellow, I sha'n't
have a remittance till Monday. Just
make a note of it, will ye. By-the-bye,
Fitz, my boy, I'll take you
another bet that I don't get that remittance
till Tuesday."</p>

<p>"All right, Major, all right," exclaimed
Fitz-Cowles, concealing his
chagrin with the best possible grace.
"Don't think I'll take that other bet.
By-the-bye, I am going to Mrs. Tulip
St. Smith's <i>conversazione</i> to-night.
Will you go with me, Major?"</p>

<p>"What is to be did?" replied the
Major, sticking his hands in his vest
pockets&mdash;"Cock fightin' or a bear
bait, or anything o' that kind?"</p>

<p>"Nothing so refined. You must
talk of Byron and Shelley and Mrs.
Hummins or Hemans&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't know much about Byron,
Colonel, but as poor Shelly&mdash;Gad!
Didn't my next neighbor give him
thirty-nine for runnin' off with a yellow

<!-- page 242 col 2 -->

gal? Shelly was the worst buck
nigger on Jones' place!"</p>

<p>Fitz-Cowles' acquaintance with the
literature or the literary cant of the
day, was exceedingly limited, but the
remark of the round-faced Mulhill was
too strong for even his intellectual
nerves.</p>

<p>"The fellow is a decided jackass!"
he muttered, leading the way from the
parlor&mdash;"I say Mulhill, did you ever
read a book in your life?" he exclaimed,
as he lifted the dead-latch of the
front door&mdash;"Did you ever read so
much as a Magazine?"</p>

<p>"Didn't I? Haven't we all them
pictur' books down south? Steel plates
in front, depictin' the feelin's of pussies
deprived of their ma's, and nice love
tales full o' grand descriptions of the
way young genelmen an' ladies dies
for won another, without so much as
leavin' a pocket-hank'cher to tell their
fate! Read the Migizines? Wot po'try,
wot sentiment, wot murder, an' madness,
an mush-and-milk, for a greasy
quarter! Cool me with a julap, by&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Hist! Look yonder, Major!" exclaimed
Fitz-Cowles, pointing to the
door-steps of Livingstone's mansion,
which they had but a moment left&mdash;"Who
is that young fellow, standing
in front of Livingstone's door? Who
can it be? A fashionable hat and a
sweeping mantle! Egad! He leaves
the door and hurries down Fourth
Street! Come on, Mulhill&mdash;let's give
chase!"</p>

<p>"Kick me to death with crickets!
And why should I give chase? Ha,
ha, ha! D'ye see that paper, Curnel,
d'ye see that document? Ho, ho, ho!
What 'ud ye give to read it? Hurray,
hurray!"</p>

<!-- page 243 col 1 -->

<p>And to the utter astonishment of
Fitz-Cowles, the ardent Southerner
with his red round face, half-hidden
by an immense shirt collar, and his
portly form enveloped in a white
blanket overcoat, commenced performing
an irregular dance along the
pavement of South Fourth Street, tossing
his felt hat on high with one hand,
while the other grasped a slip of dingy
paper, and waved it to and fro, in the
winter air.</p>

<p>"What in the deuce do you mean?
Folks will think you're crazy. What's
that letter about?"</p>

<p>"What's it about?" echoed Mulhill,
with a broad grin widening his features&mdash;"Nothin'
pertikler! Jist a love
letter from a g-a-l!"</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br/>

<p>CHAPTER SIXTH.</p>

<p class="small">DEVIL-BUG IN LOVE.</p>

</div>

<p>"YOUR name is&mdash;"</p>

<p>As Devil-Bug leaning over the table,
hissed these whispered words in the
ear of the listener, his face assumed
an expression of hideous glee,
his lips parting with a sneering grimace,
while a multitude of minute
wrinkles, diverging from the corner
of his eyelids, spread over his swarthy
skin, in a smile of fiend-like triumph
and scorn.</p>

<p>"My name&mdash;" echoed the stranger,
drawing the folds of his cloak yet
more closely around his form, while
his hand with an involuntary movement
swept his dark curls more thickly
over his white forehead. "My
name is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dora Livingstone!" whispered

<!-- page 243 col 2 -->

Devil-Bug, resting the knuckles of his
iron hands upon the edge of the table.
"The wife of the rich Merchant!
Alone and in Monk-Hall!"</p>

<p>The face of the stranger became
suddenly pale as death, and then the
dark eyes, gleaming from beneath the
mass of jet-black curls, shot forth a
glance of fixed resolution.</p>

<p>"Beware how you whisper that
name within these walls!" The voice
was calm and resolute, that spoke
these words. "Woman, as I am, it
were not safe for you to dare my vengeance!
I came here for revenge!
You are the man to fulfil my settled
purpose&mdash;I have asked you to commit
a horrible crime but you shall have
gold for your labor. Gold sufficient
to make you a rich man! This Luke
Harvey must die!"</p>

<p>"It's quite a pleasure to hear her
talk!" cried Devil-Bug, gazing upon
the face of the disguised woman, with
a look of gloating admiration. "To
think that the creetur' with them
devil's eyes is a woman, with a soft
buzzim and a plump form! Ho, ho,
ho! Luke Harvey <i>shall</i> die, good
lady if you wish it, but the wages ain't
to be paid in goold."</p>

<p>"What mean you?" exclaimed
Dora, with a look of disgust impressing
the lines of her proud countenance,
as she marked the expression
of Devil-Bug's loathsome face.</p>

<p>"The goold I want good lady, is a
kiss from a red lip; a little love you
know, and a good deal o' fondness!
That's my price. I ain't to be had on
any other terms. Ho, ho, ho! The
han'some Merchant's wife in love with
old Devil-Bug&mdash;I vonders how that
'ud vork?"</p>

<!-- page 244 col 1 -->

<p>The bosom of the disguised
rose heaving beneath the folds of her
cloak, and her dark eyes flashed with
fierce indignation.</p>

<p>"And dare you presume to hold
such language with me? Another
word of such insolence from your lips,
and by the Heaven above me, you die!"</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet, and flinging
the cloak from her shoulders, stood
with her proud form elevated to its
full stature, while her fair white hands,
each held a pistol extended at arms
length, in an attitude of determined
menace.</p>

<p>"Look here Musketer, look here
Glow-worm&mdash;ain't that a purty sight?
You're the rale pluck I tell ye, g-a-l!
D'ye mean them words as a purty
speech or as rale sensible tolk? D'ye
see them niggers? Suppose ye fire
at yer humble sarvant, d'ye think a
g-a-l with yer soft bosom and smooth
limbs ar' a match for sich reg'lar iron-boned
devils as them darkies? I have
seen ye afore, gal, and liked ye&mdash;Come
to my terms, and I'll come to yours!
A kiss for every drop o' blood I shed
on your account!"</p>

<p>Dora started at the sight of the two
negroes, nestling in the dark corners
of the Doorkeeper's den.</p>

<p>"Oh madness, madness!" she muttered,
dropping her face instinctively
on her bosom, while her extended
hands still grasped the pistols in their
fair white fingers. "I have placed my
name and reputation at the mercy of
this fiend in human shape! There
are witnesses to this dark interview&mdash;oh
madness, madness!"</p>

<p>Devil-Bug quietly motioned his Negroes
to leave the den. As they crept
through the door leading into the mansion,

<!-- page 244 col 2 -->

he silently glided around the
table, and stood at the side of the beautiful
woman, whose head still rested
upon her bosom.</p>

<p>"I like yer spirit&mdash;" he whispered,
fixing his solitary eye upon her reddening
face with a look of gloating admiration&mdash;"If
you want to leave these
doors, old Devil-Bug is not the man
to stop you. But look ye, good lady,
if you but say the word, Luke Harvey
shall not see the sun rise to-morrow!
You go up stairs, and wait till daybreak
in a private room; no one shall
dare to molest ye! When I bring you
that 'ere ring, which Luke ain't to part
with except with his life, then you are
to pay me, the&mdash;the&mdash;goold?"</p>

<p>Dora said never a word, but letting
the pistols fall from her hands, she
sank in the seat, and hid her face in
her bosom, while the long tresses of
her dark hair, escaping from beneath
the velvet cap, fell showering and luxuriant
over her neck and shoulders, so
beautifully disguised in man's attire.</p>

<p>"Insulted, scorned, despised." she
murmured, "And by the man I once
so deeply loved! My name at his mercy,
my whole fortune hanging on a
chance word from his lips! Shall I
pause in my career of revenge? This
night and to-morrow safely passed, I
am Countess of Lyndeswold. Yes,
yes, Luke Harvey must die, at any
price, at all hazards, must die&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lady what's the use of mutterin'
an' mumblin' to yerself? Is it a bargain?
If it is, jist reach out yer hand,
and let me kiss it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bring me the ring, and you shall
revel in wealth&mdash;" whispered Dora,
raising her face slowly from her bosom.</p>

<p>"If you'd a kept yer face hid a

<!-- page 245 col 1 -->

minnit longer, I might 'ave corne to yer
terms. But with the sight o' that face
afore me, I'd sooner you'd come to
mine! I'd sooner revel on yer lip,
good lady, than to float in goold up to
my eyes! Is it a bargain? Gi' us
yer hand&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dora slowly rose from her seat.
How beautiful she looked, as standing
erect in her disguise, with her long
dark hair, falling aside from her face,
she folded her arms across her heaving
bosom, and remained for a single
moment, silent and motionless. The
light fell softly over the outline of her
form, revealing the symmetry of her
limbs, so round in their faultless shape,
the swelling ripeness of her bosom,
heaving beneath the disguise of the
closely-buttoned frock coat, the slender
waist, and the proportions of her figure,
widening with beauty below the waist,
and gradually narrowing again like
the outline of an invented pyramid, as
they approached the small and delicate
feet, enclosed in tight-fitting boots,
which reached mid-way to the knee.
She was very beautiful, and her compressed
lip, and pale forehead, darkening
with a frown, gave her lovely
countenance, an expression of deep
and painful thought, which disclosed
the mighty struggle at work within
her soul.</p>

<p>"Gi' us yer hand!" said Devil-Bug,
as he glided closer to her side.</p>

<p>"The ring&mdash;" was all that Dora,
found strength to murmur, as with her
face averted, she slowly extended her
fair white hand toward the deformed
wretch by her side.</p>

<p>"This is the goold for which I bargains&mdash;"
exclaimed Devil-Bug as dropping
on his knees, he applied his loathsome

<!-- page 245 col 2 -->

lips to the skin of that delicate
hand&mdash;"Before daybreak you shall
have the ring, and I the goold! Ha,
ha! Ho, ho! Vonders how that
'ill vork?"</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br/>

<p>CHAPTER SEVENTH.</p>

<p class="small">PARSON PYNE AND HIS DAUGHTER.</p>

</div>

<p>"COMFORTABLE range of apartments,"
muttered the Rev. Dr. Pyne, as
he entered a small chamber on the
second floor. "This is my study. A nice
little room, with a coal fire in the grate,
a lamp on the table, a cupboard in the
corner, and a bed in the other. This
is what I call comfortable," he smiled
pleasantly as standing with his back
to the fire, and his hands under his
coat-tails, he warmed his respectable
person, and surveyed the room, at the
same time. "This is the retreat to
which the Foe of Pagan Rome retires,
when the labors of the pulpit are over.
Ha, ha! I am blessed with an affectionate
and loving congregation. Dear
people, they love me! I preached with
unction to-night, powerful, very powerful
unction, and talking of unction,
I believe I'll try a little brandy."</p>

<p>With that pleasant smile beaming
from his red round face, that smile
which won him bank-note opinions
from the wealthy old women of his
flock, and endeared him to the hearts
of all the Patent-Gospellers, the good
Doctor advanced to the cupboard, and
taking a corpulent decanter from its
recesses, poured himself a very tolerable
glass of blushing Cogniac. Surveying
the creature for a moment,

<!-- page 246 col 1 -->

with his one eye closed, and his full
red lips dropped apart, the Reverend
gentleman after this silent pause of
thought, raised the glass to his lips
with the emphatic sentiment; 'Down
with the Pope of Pagan Rome; up
with the Patent-Gospellers!'</p>

<p>"Good brandy, that," he murmured
replacing the empty glass in the
cupboard. "Old Swipes, one of our
Elders who keeps a wine store, sent
me that brandy in mistake for wine.
It was intended for the use of our
church on particular occasions; I use
it instead of the church which does
just as well."</p>

<p>The Reverend gentleman then seated
his portly person, in the large arm-chair
beside the fire, and taking a corpulent
pocket-book from a side pocket,
he displayed its contents, on his outspread
knees.</p>

<p>"Funds are easy with us to-day,"
said the good man smiling as he spoke,
"My wants were quite numerous this
morning; to-night they are amply
supplied. That ten dollar note came
from a good old lady, on account of a
poor man, who was run over by the
cars. A widow with five small children
and one at the breast, will doubtless
be relieved when she beholds the
'twenty,' which was presented to me
for her, by an aged brother of our
flock. That gold-piece is for the poor
man, who fell from a five-story house,
with a hod on his shoulder. This five
dollar note, came with a letter, which
defied the Pope of Rome in very strong
language. 'Down with the Pope of
Pagan Rome, yours&mdash;<i>Shadroe</i>.' Shadroe
is a very zealous brother; quite
fiery. And here is a 'fifty,' which
was tendered me for the use of an indigent

<!-- page 246 col 2 -->

young brother, about to commence
the Gospel Ministry. There's
somewhere near a hundred dollars in
all, collected by me since breakfast
this morning. A good day's work."</p>

<p>The Rev. F. A. T. Pyne chuckled
pleasantly to himself, and winked rather
viciously at the small Bible on the
mantle-piece. It was a very pleasant
thing to behold the fruits of his day's
labor resting on his knee, in the shape
of solid gold and bank notes; and our
admiration of the sight is increased to
a positive reverence for Dr. Pyne,
when we remember that the poor man
who was run over by the cars, the
widow with five children and one at
the breast, the man who fell from a
five-story house with a hod on his
shoulder, and the indigent young brother
about to commence the Gospel
Ministry, were all lively fictions, invented
by the Foe of Pagan Rome, for
the especial benefit of his two rooms
and other conveniences at Monk-Hall.
But this you will understand is a positive
secret, and having been entrusted
to us in strict confidence, must on no
account go any farther.</p>

<p>"A little opium won't hurt me, I
opine," said the good Brother taking
small paper from his pocket, which
being opened, disclosed a number of
smaller papers, all carefully folded in
a square form, with an Apothecary's
label, on the outside of each. "We
temperance folks must have some little
excitement after we have forsworn intemperance.
When we leave off Alcohol,
we indulge our systems with a
little Opium. That's what I call a
capital compromise."</p>

<p>The Brother now arose from his
seat, and quietly opened a small door,

<!-- page 247 col 1 -->

leading into the adjoining chamber.
A cheerful smile overspread his round
face, and his watery eyes twinkled
with glee. There was something very
meaning in the energy with which he
smacked his large red lips together.</p>

<p>"She sleeps!" he muttered, and
then with a quiet manner and cautious
footstep stole into the chamber,
closing the door carefully behind him.</p>

<p>It was a wide and spacious chamber,
with lofty ceiling and wainscotted
walls. A small lamp burning on the
table near the fire-place, gave a clear
cold light to the hearth-side, while the
other parts of the room were wrapt in
shadow. Like most of the chambers
of Monk-Hall, this room wore an ancient
and desolate appearance. The
heavy oaken wainscot of the walls, the
chairs of massive mahogany, with
high-backs and carved limbs, the small
couch standing in one corner, with its
snow-white counterpane and spotless
pillow contrasting with the heavy
carvings of the bed-posts of dark walnut,
the faded carpet on the floor,
and the elaborate wood-work above
the mantel, with the coal fire smouldering
in the grate below, such were
the characteristics of the ancient chamber,
which was rendered dark and
gloomy by the absence of windows
from the lofty walls. A small aperture
near the ceiling not more than
two feet long and one foot high, could
scarcely be called a window; although
it was intended to give a faint glimpse
of light during the daytime.</p>

<p>Near the fire, a fair girl, dressed in
spotless white, was sleeping as she
reclined in a massive arm-chair, whose
high-back thickly cushioned with dark
velvet, afforded a gentle repose to her

<!-- page 247 col 2 -->

maidenly form. The light fell mildly
over her countenance, disclosing its
pale hues and regular features, strikingly
relieved by the long black hair
which half unbound fell waving over
her cheek, down to her shoulders.
Her hands small and delicate, and
death-like as the whitest marble, were
clasped in front of her person, and the
light folds of the robe, which enveloped
her form like a death-shroud,
were softly agitated by the faint motion
of her bosom, heaving gently upward
as she slept.</p>

<p>So like a pure and holy dream
was the beauty of the fair girl, as she
lay sleeping quietly in the den of
Monk-Hall, that Altamont Pyne, started
with involuntary awe, as he gazed
upon his daughter's face. Her beauty
was of that peculiar cast which
mingles high intellect and purity of
soul with all the enticing loveliness of
a fair young form, soft limbs, a delicate
bosom, throbbing with the impulses
of youthful blood and a lustrous black
eye beaming with the undeveloped love
of a stainless soul. Her form somewhat
below the middle height, was
marked by peculiar and characteristic
beauties. A neck fair and round;
wide shoulders, the skin as white as
alabaster, and veined with delicate
streaks of azure; a slender waist widening
into the lower proportions of
the figure, which were marked by the
swelling outlines of womanly beauty,
and a small foot, thrust from underneath
the folds of her dress.</p>

<p>Her face was fair, in its hues, round
in its contour, swelling in its outlines,
the features regular, the brow calm
and eloquent, the lips red and ripe,

<!-- page 248 col 1 -->

marked by a bewitching loveliness of
shape, and the chin, firm and resolute
in its expression, was varied by a
laughing dimple. And yet with all
this beauty, the countenance was
white as marble, never animate with
the flushed hues of maidenhood, save
when strong emotion, called the warm
blood to the swelling cheek. As she
lay reclining in the arm-chair she
looked for all the world, like a marble
statue of an intellectual and voluptuous
maiden, with all the outline and
shape, which gives fascination to the
face and form of beauty, without the
warm hues, which tint the lips with
love, and fire the cheek with passion.</p>

<p>"Mabel is quite beautiful!" muttered
the oily-faced Parson gazing
upon the girl with his watery eyes distended
by an expression of animal
admiration. "It's most a pity to
awake her! However <i>Brother</i> Devil-Bug
will be here directly, with the potion.
Mabel," his voice assumed its
blandest whisper as he applied his
mouth to the sleeper's ear. "Mabel,
look up, my child!"</p>

<p>The maiden moved in her sleep, but
did not unclose her eyes. Gathering
her hand convulsively over her bosom,
as the soft accents of the Reverend
Pyne broke on her ear, she murmured
wildly in her sleep, as though some
terrible vision had dawned upon her
soul.</p>

<p>"It is night again," she muttered
in a voice scarcely audible. "I am
alone. The door is locked and&mdash;oh,
save me good Heaven! His footstep is
on the stairs! He comes, and I, stand
trembling at the approach of my father!
My father, ha, ha, ha! It is
night again and his hand is upon my

<!-- page 248 col 2 -->

bosom, his hot breath on my cheek!
Help, oh God, help! Father, have
mercy, oh have mercy! Your voice
it was that taught me God's own holy
truths, and now that same voice whispers
pollution in my ear. Your hands
first raised mine to God as we prayed
together, and now father those hands&mdash;oh
God! Oh God!"</p>

<p>"Awake my child," whispered Altamont
Pyne as his red round face
grew suddenly pale.</p>

<p>"It is night, it is night!" muttered
the sleeping girl, "Back, father, I say
back! God's vengeance will strike ye
dead, if ye but attempt this horrible
crime! Back I say, or with this lamp
I will fire the window curtains, and in
an instant this house, which you have
forever polluted by this attempt at
crime, never to be named in human
ears, this house will arise to heaven
in flames! Each spark of flame, a
witness before God, of the horrible
crime! Back I say&mdash;I will to the
door&mdash;back, or I fire the house! Ha,
ha! I gain the door, the entry is past
and the stairs! Ha, ha! I am in
the street, the night is cold and the
flinty stones rend my feet, but I am
saved, I am saved!"</p>

<p>"Mabel, awake I say!" exclaimed
Brother Pyne, with an angry frown.
"You should not encourage these
night-mare dreams. Ugh! The girl
makes me shiver, and yet her lip is
ripe as a May cherry! Where is
Devil-Bug with his potion?"</p>

<p>"Oh let me in for the sake of God!"
the accents of the sleeper broke on the
air in tones of agony. "The night is
dark and I am cold! My feet are
pierced by the flinty stones, and the
winter hail and snow beats against my

<!-- page 249 col 1 -->

bosom! Open your door, oh stranger,
for <i>he</i> pursues me! <i>He</i>, my father,
and I fear him worse than the grave!"</p>

<p>"Mabel&mdash;girl, I say will you hush
this nonsense!" exclaimed Parson
Pyne, in an angry tone, as he shook
the maiden roughly by the shoulder.</p>

<p>The girl slowly unclosed her eyes
and gazed in his face with a bewildered
stare.</p>

<p>"Oh do not hurt me, father," she
exclaimed clasping her hands beseechingly
in his face.</p>

<p>"Hurt ye, girl? Who talks of
hurtin' ye?" exclaimed Pyne, betrayed
by his excited feelings, into an
harshness of dialect which spoke of
the habits of his former life, when he
was not precisely a saint. "What
d'ye set there dreamin' about such
stuff and nonsense? Haven't I provided
you a home, where you might
recover from the unfortunate state of
mind which has possessed you of late?
Dismiss that unhappy dream, my
child, dismiss that unhappy dream,
now and forever!"</p>

<p>Brother Pyne drew a chair, and sat
down by his daughter's side.</p>

<p>"And then, father, you think it was
a dream?" she exclaimed, with an expression
of rapture warming over her
face.</p>

<p>"To be sure I do, Mabel, to be sure
I do!" said Brother Pyne, quickly.
"Put your arms round my neck and
kiss me, that's a good daughter."</p>

<p>Mabel reached forth her arms and
entwined them round her father's neck.
She kissed him on the cheek with her
lips, now reddened with excitement,
but a cold shudder ran over her form,
in the very act. She shrank back into
her chair as though she had been

<!-- page 249 col 2 -->

stung by a serpent. At this moment
she looked very beautiful. Her swelling
cheeks were flushed with sudden
life, her large dark eyes beamed with
soul, and her lips so bewitching in
their shape, grew moist and red as
rose-buds heavy with morning dew.
Her brow white as alabaster and calm
as death, was eloquent with the silent
intensity of thought, which absorbed
her soul. And aside from that fair
brow swept her raven hair, falling in
long and glossy tresses to her rounded
shoulders, and imparting a solemn
beauty to the loveliness of her countenance.</p>

<p>"Oh father," she murmured, "the
night, <i>the night</i> when I fled from your
roof. Was it all a dream?"</p>

<p>"To be sure it was, my dear," replied
Dr. Pyne, taking his daughter's
hand within his own.</p>

<p>"Did you not seek my chamber,
did you not&mdash;oh horror, horror! My
tongue cleaves to the roof of my
mouth, when I endeavor to picture
forth that scene in words!"</p>

<p>"Tush, tush, this is all nonsense!"
and as he spoke the Doctor gently
wound his arms around her waist.
"Have I not always been a kind father
to you? Have I not rented this
house for your especial comfort? You
see, my child, your solitary way of
life has slightly, very slightly, affected
your mind. A few weeks of quiet,
with the change of scene afforded by
this old mansion, the perusal of wholesome
books, together with the cheerful
conversation of your father, will bring
you right again. Have your attendants
brought you any refreshments,
my child?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father. An hour ago, just

<!-- page 250 col 1 -->

as I had lain down upon the bed to
rest myself for a few moments, a servant
entered the chamber, and set food
upon the table before the fire. He did
not observe me, father, but I saw him
and was chilled with horror at the
sight of his hideous countenance. Why
do you employ such a hideous monster,
father?"</p>

<p>"What, Brother Abijah? Oh he
is a fine fellow, a Christian, my daughter,
although his face is not precisely
handsome. What are you thinking
of now, Mabel?"</p>

<p>And Brother Pyne patted the palm
of her fair white hand, while his arm
gathered more lovingly around her
waist.</p>

<p>"Of my mother! She has been
dead long, very long, has she not, father?
Many and many an hour, in
the daytime, when abroad in the
street, and at night when resting in
bed, have I endeavored to recall the
memory of her face, or a tone of her
voice, or a smile wreathing her lips,
but in vain! All is dark with me,
when I think of my mother."</p>

<p>"The fact is she died when you
was a mere baby, Mabel. Think, my
child, what a care you have been to
your father, how he has reared you
up in the Lord; how, from time to
time, he has filled your young mind
with the teachings of divine truth.
Think of this, my child, and then
think of your conduct in leaving that
paternal roof which had sheltered you
from childhood! Forgive this tear,
Mabel, I can't help it."</p>

<p>The Rev. Brother Pyne was deeply
affected. If ever his oily face glowed
with an expression of sincere feeling
it was at that moment. Mabel gazed

<!-- page 250 col 2 -->

upon him for a moment, and then
flung her arms around his neck.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, my father, forgive
me!"</p>

<p>"<i>Father!</i>" echoed a hoarse voice,
and Devil-Bug, holding a waiter in his
extended hands, glided from the doorway
and advanced toward the light.
"I say, Brother Pyne, here's the hot
coffee which you called for, and hot
cakes in the bargain."</p>

<p>As he spoke he advanced toward
the table, and arranged the contents
of the waiter upon the white cloth
which he spread over its surface.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, ho! So the gal puts her
arms around his neck, does she?
There won't be much need of the drug
in that case!" he muttered to himself,
as he arranged the supper equipage
upon the table. " 'Father' indeed!
Could I 'ave heered my own ears?"</p>

<p>The girl raised her head from her
father's shoulder. At the same moment
Devil-Bug, turning on his heel
to leave the room, caught a glimpse
of her face for the first time. He
started backward as though he had
received a death-wound in his very
heart. The waiter fell clattering on
the floor, and with another start backward,
Devil-Bug raised his hands and
gazed upon the face of the young girl.
Never in his life had Devil-Bug been
seized with an agitation terrible as this.
His face grew white as a sheet, and
his solitary eye glanced forth from its
socket with one wild and absorbing
gaze. Once or twice he essayed to
speak, but the incoherent words died
on his tongue.</p>

<p>"I say, brother, what's the matter?"
cried Parson Pyne, gazing
upon the Doorkeeper with unfeigned

<!-- page 251 col 1 -->

astonishment. "Going to have a fit,
brother?"</p>

<p>Devil-Bug slowly advanced to the
Parson's side. He reached forth his
arm and laid his hand lightly on the
girl's shoulder. He spoke in a voice
utterly changed from his usual harsh
and discordant tones.</p>

<p>"<i>Ellen!</i>" he said, in a low and
softened voice, whose gentleness of
tone presented a strange contrast to
the harsh deformity of his visage.
"Ellen is this you, or is it your
ghost?"</p>

<p>Mabel gazed upon his face in silent
wonder, and Parson Pyne rose angrily
from his seat.</p>

<p>"What means this insolence?" he
shouted, in a tone of blustering
anger.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," replied Devil-Bug,
with his usual grunting tone of voice.
"Only that gal looks somethin' like a
gal I used to know; that's all."</p>

<p>And he strode hastily toward the
door.</p>

<p>"Devil-Bug," cried Fat Pyne, in a
whisper, as he hurried after the retreating
Doorkeeper. "Is the coffee
drugged?"</p>

<p>"Yes it is, Parson," growled Devil-Bug,
with his hand on the door.</p>

<p>"Soh, soh! All's right then. Devil-Bug
you will lock all the doors after
you, if you please," he added, in a
whisper. "You understand? I don't
want to be interrupted and mark ye,
if you should hear a shriek or a groan,
you needn't mind it."</p>

 <p>"Oh, I needn't, needn't I?" echoed
Devil-Bug, while an expression, which
Pyne had never witnessed before, stole
over his deformed visage. "Parson
you've got the gal all in your own

<!-- page 251 col 2 -->

power, the coffee's drugged and the
doors shall be locked, and we won't
mind no shrieks nor groans nor other
capers. But you must answer me
won quest'in. That gal called you
father?"</p>

<p>"Did she tho'?" replied Dr. Pyne,
blandly. "I really didn't mind it."</p>

<p>"You ain't her father, then?" asked
Devil-Bug, with that peculiar expression
deepening over his visage.</p>

<p>"Of course not. Except in a spiritual
sense ha, ha, ha! A <i>spiritual</i>
sense, you know!"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" echoed Devil-Bug,
with a wild and hollow laugh.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, ho!" chuckled Parson
Pyne, in a quiet way, peculiar to himself.
"You won't mind a shriek or a
groan if you should chance to hear
one?"</p>

<p>"Devil a mind!" replied Devil-Bug,
as he stepped through the doorway.
"You're a jolly cove, you are!"</p>

<p>And Parson Pyne caught the strange
gleam of Devil-Bug's solitary eye, and
laughed merrily as he closed the door,
while Devil-Bug echoed his laugh with
a hollow sound, more like the groan
of a dying man who struggles with
death and madness at the same time,
than the echo of a cheerful laugh.</p>

<p>"He's alone with the gal!" he muttered,
as he stood in the small chamber
where the Parson had consoled
himself with a glass of brandy. "And
she called him <i>father!</i>"</p>

<p>That peculiar expression which had
been gathering over his face, while
conversing with the Parson, now
manifested itself in a look of fiend-like
hatred, which convulsed every line of
the Doorkeeper's countenance. Sweeping
his thick hair aside, he bared his

<!-- page 252 col 1 -->

protuberant brow to the light. The
swarthy skin was corrugated with
thick wrinkles, which stood out from
his deformed forehead like knotted
cords. The shrunken eye-socket
seemed to sink yet farther beneath his
overhanging brow, while his solitary
eye, gathering a strange light, enlarged
and dilated until its gleam grew
like the glare of burning coals. His
pointed teeth were firmly clenched together,
and his lips were agitated by
a hideous grimace, which gave a grotesque
effect to the terrible frown of
his brow and the fiend-like glare of
his eye. He shook his large hands
wildly on high, and clenched madly
at the air with his talon fingers.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, ho!" he cried, as the idea,
which absorbed his soul, rose before
him like an embodied thing of flesh
and blood. "Ho, ho, ho! I vonders
how <i>that</i> 'ill vork!"</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br/>

<p>CHAPTER EIGHTH.</p>

<p class="small">THE PIT OF MONK-HALL.</p>

</div>

<p>"LOOK here Glow-worm, look here
Musketer!" he shouted to his negroes,
who sat dozing before the fire. "D'ye
see that poker and that old tongs?
Stick 'em in the coal fire, and heat
'em to a white heat! The poker has
a sharp pint&mdash;it 'ill do, it 'ill do!"</p>

<p>"Yes, massa," growled Musquito,
as his lips&mdash;which the reader will remember
were shapen like two sides of
a triangle&mdash;distended in a hideous
grin. Yes, massa, I doves put de
pokar in de fi-ah!"</p>

<p>"An' I de tong!" exclaimed Glow-worm,

<!-- page 252 col 2 -->

his huge mouth grinning like
a death's-head, as he inserted the old
tongs between the bars of the grate.</p>

<p>"Ye'r a pair of beauties!" exclaimed
Devil-Bug, gazing upon his satellites
with paternal fondness. "Hell
can't produce ye'r match."</p>

<p>Certainly they were a pair of beauties.
As squatting in low stools on
either side of the fire, they looked up
in their master's face, their hideous
visages assumed an expression of infernal
glee. Give us a picture of the
scene, Darley. Sharpen your pencil,
and select your best piece of Bristol
board. This is a study worthy of
your genius. We are looking at the
scene from the dark corner of the
room. The light flares from yonder
table, in the background, Devil-Bug
stands in front of the fire; his negroes
squat on either side. Musquito with
his back toward us, extends his left
hand and holds the iron between the
bars of the grate, and looks up in his
master's face, presenting to our view
the profile of his hideous visage, the
receding forehead, the flat nose, the
opened mouth with the lips, meeting
in a point near the nose and diverging
toward the sharp and prominent chin.
Opposite him, Glow-worm, with the
light from the table falling on his
broad shoulders and the beams of the
fire illumining his face, rolls his large
eyes towards his master, while his
rude mouth, with the teeth projecting
like fangs, is distorted with a loathsome
grimace, and his muscular right
hand also holds the iron between the
bars of the grate. And the master,
Darley, paint him for us; picture old
Devil-Bug. He stands between the
twain, his massive face receiving on

<!-- page 253 col 1 -->

one cheek the gleam of the lamp; or
its whole extent the glare of the fire.
Picture his broad brow, hanging over
his wide face, like the edge of a beetling
cliff over a receding precipice.
The eyeless socket, the glaring eye,
the heavy eyebrows, the flat nose with
wide nostrils, the mouth convulsed by
a grotesque grimace that discloses the
clenched teeth, the pointed chin, bristling
with a stiff beard, the matted hair
hanging aside from the face and brow
in uneven locks; picture it all, Darley.
If your wonderful pencil, which traverses
the sheet of drawing paper with
such gracefulness and such vigor
linked together by taste, if this pencil,
Darley, can depict a nightmare standing
erect, with a hideous Dream squatting
on either side, then you will have
delineated Devil-Bug and his attendant
negroes as they were grouped in that
cozy little chamber of Monk-Hall.</p>

<p>"Musketer when you've heated that
'ere iron hot enough, jist go down
stairs and git a few strands o' thick
rope. We shall want it in this room
arter awhile. And look ye, Glow-worm,
keep your ears picked, will
ye? If you don't I'll pick 'em with a
hot fork. If you hear a cry, or a
groan, or even a moan from that gal
in the next room, jist run up stairs and
call me! I'll be in the Walnut-Room;
d'ye mind, ye black devil?"</p>

<p>Seizing the lamp in his right hand,
Devil-Bug hurried from Monk Baltzar's
ante-chamber, as it was styled,
and in a moment found himself hastening
along the dark corridor which
traversed the second floor of the mansion.</p>

<p>"I like this old place!" he muttered,

<!-- page 253 col 2 -->

as he ascended the staircase of the
mansion. "Here was I born, and
here I've lived all my life! I never
had a friend in all my born days, but
these old walls have been my friends!
I've talked to the brick pillars in the
dead-vault; I've had many a joke
with the skeleton in the Banquet-Room;
and&mdash;ho, ho, ho&mdash;the trap-doors
all know me, and creak for joy
when they hear me comin'! Hur-ray
for Monk-Hall, say I! It's the body,
I'm its soul! It's full o' nooks and
corners and dark places; so is my
natur'! I like the old place; there
ain't a brick in it that I don't love like
a brother! Ha, ha, ha! When I
die I should feel obliged to the rowdy
as 'ud set it afire! It must go with
me! When I'm gone it 'ill be like a
coffin without a corpse. What's the
use o' th' shell when the torkle's
dead?"</p>

<p>Devil-Bug stood on the main corridor
of the third floor, which with
another corridor, meeting at right
angles, separated Lorrimer's rooms
from the other part of the mansion.
Thus you might enter the Walnut
Room, through a door which opened
into the corridor, near the head of the
stairs; or passing along the corridor,
you might pursue the gallery which
ran east and west until you reached
the door of Lorrimer's Drawing-Room.
Passing through the drawing room,
you traversed the Painted Chamber,
the Rose Chamber, and then entered
the Walnut Room. Next to the Walnut
Room, was the Tower Room,
which terminated the range of Lorrimer's
apartments.</p>

<p>"B'lieve I'll go into the Walnut
Room by this door. That fellow

<!-- page 254 col 1 -->

Byrnewood has cost me trouble enough.
I'll put an end to his story, with something
sharper than a trap-door or a
bottle o' drugs! Vonders how that
'ill vork?"</p>

<p>He entered the Walnut Room. The
glittering floor gave back the reflection
of the light which he held in his hands.
The place was silent and desolate,
with nothing but the bare walls, the
dark ceiling and the glittering floor of
polished mahogany. In the centre of
the room, lay a shapeless mass which
moved slowly to and fro, while Devil-Bug
advanced, and as the light flashed
over its outlines, resolved itself into
the form of a human being.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! Not more than
twelve hours ago, this lump o' flesh an'
blood an' broadcloth was a fine young
gentleman who cut all sorts o' capers
in the next room. Cussed like a trooper
and swore like a preacher! A
little bit o' opium mixed in his drink,
and here he lays, a perfect bundle o'
sleep and <i>stoop</i>idity! A werry contemptible
thing is human natur'!"</p>

<p>He flung the blaze of the light full
over the face of the unconscious
wretch, who lay prostrate on the floor,
his knees huddled up against his chest,
and his outstretched hands clutching
the polished floor, with an involuntary
and ineffectual grasp. Long locks of
curling black hair fell streaming aside
from a young face, which seemed to
have grown prematurely old in the
compass of a few hours. The skin
was yellow and discolored, the lips
wore a livid hue, and the dark eyes,
glared upon the ceiling with a cold and
glassy stare. A thin, clammy foam
hung around the white lips, and there
were spots of blood upon the cheeks and

<!-- page 254 col 2 -->

hands of the unconscious man. He had
torn the flesh from his cheeks in very
madness. As Devil-Bug gazed upon
him, his limbs moved with a faint motion,
like the last sign of departing life,
and his outstretched hands grasped feebly
at the smooth boards of the floor.
The light flashed over his fixed eyeballs,
but they gave no sign of life, no quick
flashing glance that might betoken
consciousness.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! I'll try it,!" screamed
Devil-Bug with a wild shriek of
laughter. "I've heard many stories
about that same thing, but I never saw
it done! I'm jist the man to do it, and
jist in the humor to do it now!"</p>

<p>He knelt beside the unconscious
man, and allowing the light to play
over his fixed eyeballs, he applied his
mouth to his ear:</p>

<p>"Hel-lo! Youssir, I say look here.
I am a-goin' to bury you alive! D'ye
hear that? I'm a-goin' to bury you
alive! God&mdash;how the feller wriggles!
D'ye feel the cold clods fallin' on your
breast a'ready? Ho, ho, ho! I'm
a-goin' to bury you alive!"</p>

<p>A slight tremor, a quivering shudder
passed over the frame of Byrnewood
Arlington. Was he conscious
of the meaning of the words whispered
in his ear? God alone knows, but
his limbs were agitated for a moment
by a convulsive motion, and the muscles
of his face worked as with a spasm.</p>

<p>"I'll jist go an' tell Glow-worm to
watch for me in the first cellar, while
I go down, down, into the lowest hole
of Monk-Hall! When the gal shrieks,
then Musketer must whistle, and then
Glow-worm will strike the old gong,
and I will hear it, although I'm so far
below the ground. So far below the

<!-- page 255 col 1 -->

ground beside that man's grave in the
Pit of Monk-Hall! Excuse me Sir if
I keep you waitin'&mdash;" he continued
making a formal bow, with his face
toward the unconscious form of Byrnewood.
"Excuse me Sir if I'll keep
you waitin' but I'll be back d'rectly."</p>

<p>Placing the lamp on the glittering
floor, he departed from the Walnut
Room. Scarce had the sound of his
footsteps ceased to echo on the air,
when the curtains leading into the
Rose Chamber were suddenly thrust
aside, and the form of a woman with
her long brown hair falling wildly
on her neck, came hastening over the
floor of the apartment, her hands clasped
and her white dress floating loosely
around her maidenly figure.</p>

<p>Advancing along the room, she started
backward as she beheld the shapeless
form, flung prostrate at her feet,
and the light flashed over her face
while she stood entranced by the horror
of the spectacle.</p>

<p>"My brother, my brother!" she
muttered in a low-toned voice, and
then sank kneeling on the floor.</p>

<p>Her long brown hair fell wildly over
her shoulders, and her face white as
the grave-cloth was tinted in each
cheek with a spot of burning red.
Her eyes of clear and lustrous blue,
were marked by a fixed and glassy
stare, as she gazed upon the unconscious
form of Byrnewood Arlington.
The quivering lips reddened to a deep
purple hue, the brow animated by an
expression as wild as it was startling,
the hand clasped tremblingly over the
bosom, faintly heaving beneath the
folds of the white robe, all betrayed
the deep emotion, like to madness in

<!-- page 255 col 2 -->

its indications, which convulsed the
soul of the ruined girl.</p>

<p>"Oh brother," she cried taking his
hand within her arm. "You are dying
and dying for me! Speak to me,
Byrnewood, speak to me. Call your
sister by the name you used to love so
well! Oh, God!" she cried with a
wild shriek as she swept the thick
locks of his dark hair aside from his
pale brow. "He knows me not, he
knows me not!"</p>

<p>The eyes of the brother still glared
upon the ceiling, with that same fixed
and glassy stare. He betrayed no sign
of consciousness or emotion. A corse,
with all the outward marks of death,
and yet with the soul burning brightly
within, could not have presented a
more ghastly spectacle.</p>

<p>Mary took his cold hands within
her own, she kissed his wan and discolored
cheeks, she besought him in
low tones to rise from the sleep of
death, or to give but a look or a sign
of recognition. Still he lay unconscious
and motionless.</p>

<p>As she thus bent kneeling over the
unconscious form of her brother, the
figure of a woman glided from the entrance
of the Rose Chamber, and stood
by her side. It was the form of Long-haired
Bess. She gazed upon the ruin,
accomplished by Lorrimer with her
aid, and a shudder ran over her form,
as she gazed.</p>

<p>"Oh Bessie, they have murdered
him!" shrieked Mary gazing upward
in the face of the woman, while her
blue eyes, sent forth a wild and bewildered
gaze. "Look&mdash;he is dying, he
is dying and for my sake!"</p>

<p>"Hist! Mary," cried Bess veiling her

<!-- page 256 col 1 -->

eyes with her upraised hand. "Do
you not hear their footsteps on the
stairs? His torturers return, and we
shall be discovered&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh Bessie lead me to Lorraine,
for God's sake lead me! He would
not suffer this wrong. There is some
dark mystery I know, overshadowing,
my very soul, but Lorraine is innocent!
You are silent Bessie? You
do not answer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mary I will lead you from the
house&mdash;" said Bessie in a hasty voice
as she turned her face from the light.
"I will save your brother."</p>

<p>She hurried the ruined girl from her
brother's side, as she spoke.</p>

<p>"He loved me Bessie, he would not
harm my brother! I would as soon
suspect you of a wrong as Lorraine!
There is some terrible mistake Bessie,
but Lorraine is innocent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Great God! It makes my heart
bleed to hear her talk thus!" muttered
Bess leading the way into the Rose
Chamber. "Every word she utters
is a dagger in my heart! Ha, ha!
She believes <i>me</i> innocent!"</p>

<p>"Let me look upon him once
again!" shrieked Mary darting aside
from Bess, and flinging herself upon
her brother's unconscious form.
"Byrnewood, oh speak to me, oh call
your Mary by her name! Only
a word, my brother, or a look or a
glance? He does not speak, he makes
no sign&mdash;not even a glance for Mary!
And I am the cause of all this ruin&mdash;ha,
ha, ha! I see my father and my
mother there, there they stand gazing
upon the corse of their son! And
they raise their hands, they curse me,
with his death! Do you not see them
Bessie&mdash;oh it freezes my blood, to look

<!-- page 256 col 2 -->

upon my father's grey hair, which he
scatters to the winds as he asks Heaven
to curse me!"</p>

<p>She rose to her feet, and with her
blue eyes glaring at the vacant air,
with her beautiful countenance, for it
was beautiful even amid woe, and horror
worse than death, with her fair
young face, paled to the hue of ashes,
she extended her arms as if to wave
back the spectres who stood beside her
brother's unconscious form.</p>

<p>"Ha! Devil-Bug returns!" exclaimed
Bess silently gliding behind
Mary, and gathering her form in her
arms. "I'll foil him yet! Byrnewood
shall yet be saved!"</p>

<p>Raising Mary in her arms, she bore
her silently from the Walnut Room.</p>

<p>A moment passed and Devil-Bug
stood beside his victim again.</p>

<p>"Come my feller&mdash;" he cried raising
the unconscious form of Byrnewood
upon his shoulders. "You an'
me has got a little business to transact,
which ought to be done in private."</p>

<p>Unheeding the muttered groan which
escaped from Byrnewood's lips, he
raised him on his shoulder, as though
he had been a mere bundle of merchandize.
In a moment he left the
Walnut Room, and was descending the
stairs, with the unconscious man on
his shoulders, while his extended hand
grasped the flickering lamp. With a
quiet smile on his lip Devil-Bug descended
the stairs, and in a few moments
stood on the floor of the hall,
opening into the Banquet Room. The
echo of shouts mingled with laughter
rung around the place. Devil-Bug
grimly smiled, and passing the doorway
of the Banquet Room, stole cautiously
along the damp floor of the hall,

<!-- page 257 col 1 -->

and in a moment the glare of the lamp
flashed over the grand stairway of
stone, leading far down into the vaults
of Monk-Hall.</p>

<p>And far, far down over massive steps
of granite, with solid arches above and
thick walls on either side, far, far down,
with the rays of the lamp flashing over
the void beneath, with a faint yet gloomy
effect, like a light darting its beams
along the darkness of some hideous
well, Devil-Bug pursued his way, his
strong right arm supporting the unconscious
form of his victim flung like
a bundle over his shoulder, while his
distorted face grew animate with
that grimace of habitual cruelty,
which gave his visage the expression
of an incarnate fiend, and developed
all the hideous moral deformity of his
nature.</p>

<p>Down, down over damp steps of
granite, down, down! The monotonous
echo of his footsteps disturbs the
silence of the air, and now and then,
his victim with his face hanging over
the shoulders of the Doorkeeper, utters
a faint moan, as he feebly clutches at
the door with his hands. The stairway
terminates on a wide hall with
roof and floor of stone. On one side
the massive door leading into the
Dead-vault of Monk-Hall, on the other
side another door, as high and as massive,
leading into the Wine-cellar of
the old mansion. At Devil-Bug's back
ascends the stairway of granite; he
advances along the stone floor and at
his very feet descends another stair
way, more dark and gloomy than the
first, with clammy moisture trickling
down the walls, while the light flares
fitfully over a long succession of stone
blocks, sinking far, far down into the

<!-- page 257 col 2 -->

bosom of earth and night. This stairway
leads to the Pit of Monk-Hall.</p>

<p>Ha! Old Devil-Bug starts and
clenches his hand, and at the very
thought of that fearful cavern, sunk
far beneath the earth, below the
foundations of Monk-Hall.</p>

<p>Has the name of the place a terrible
memory for your soul, Devil-Bug?
Does no phantom arise before you as
standing on the verge of the stairway,
you gaze into the void below,
does no phantom with blood-dripping
hair and ghastly eyes, arise before
you, and scare you back? The phantom
of a murdered man with a mangled
jaw sunken on the breast, a
tongue lolling from his mouth, and
blood-shot eyes starting from a face
darkened to purple by the hand of
death.</p>

<p>Ho, ho! What cares Devil-Bug
for phantoms in his path, or white-shrouded
ghosts gliding by his side!
Derided and scorned by that fellow
man, whom he never yet called, brother,
the offcast of the world from his
very birth, a walking curse and a
breathing execration upon all mankind,
why should old Devil-Bug fear that
Phantom World, which dawns upon his
solitary eye?</p>

<p>Ha! Ha, ha! Old Devil-Bug loves
the old arches of Monk-Hall, he loves
the cellars and the dens, he loves the
song of the revellers in the Banquet
Room, and the glee of the cut-throats
in the vaults below, he loves the Skeleton-Monk
like a twin-brother, but the
Phantoms, ha, ha, they are at once
his fear and his delight! The murdered
man gliding forever by his side
with the broken jaw and the starting
eyes&mdash;he hails him as a thing of joy!

<!-- page 258 col 1 -->

And the murdered woman with the
quivering form and hollow skull,
oozing with the slowly-pattering blood&mdash;ha,
ha, this phantom is one of
Devil-Bug's familiar spirits.</p>

<p>But the Pit, the Pit of Monk-Hall,
ha, ha! He shudders at the name, he
starts and grows pale. The Phantom
of the murdered man he can endure
as he has endured for years! But to
go down step by step into the lowest
deep of the pest-house, to stand in the
nethermost cavern of Monk-Hall, for
the first time for many long years,
to start with fear at the palpable presence
of the bare skull and mouldering
bones of the murdered man! Ho,
ho! This were a hard trial, even for
Devil-Bug's strong nerves and strong
heart!</p>

<p>But down, down into the pit he will
go; down, down, with the form of his
intended victim on his shoulder and
the lamp held firmly in his talon
fingers; down, down, until the air
grows thick with the breath of corruption,
and the light flashes in its socket
as it dies away under the pressure of
an atmosphere, never yet enlivened
by a single ray of God's sunlight, but
rendered fatal and deathly by the decay
of the human corse, as it crumbles
to dust, with the worms revelling
over its rottenness, and the thick night
shrouding it like a pall.</p>

<p>Shallow pated critic with your

nonsense, we do not want you here!
Pass on sweet maiden-man! Your
perfumes agree but sorrily with the
thick atmosphere of this darkening
vault, your white-kid gloves would be
soiled by a contact with the rough
hands of Devil-Bug, your innocent
and girlish soul would be shocked by
the very idea of such a hideous cavern,
hidden far below the red brick surface
of broad-brimmed Quakertown. Pass
by delightful trifler, with your civet-bag
and your curling tongs, write syllabub
forever, and pen blank verse
until dotage shall make you more
garrulous than now, but for the sake
of Heaven, do not criticise this chapter!
Our taste is different from yours.
We like to look at nature and at the
world, not only as they appear, but as
they are! To us the study of a character
like Devil-Bug's is full of interest,
replete with the grotesque-sublime.
The light of the torch glaring over
thick walls trickling with moisture;
the skeleton resting in the coffin, that
crumbles away from its bones; the
solitary grave hidden far down in
vaults where no mourners ever weep;
the terrible chaos of a heart and soul
like those of Devil-Bug, the phantoms
ever present with him, like nightmares
bestriding the heaving chest of the
Murderer&mdash;these are subjects and
fancies and characters which we delight
to picture, though our pen may
not fulfil the quick conception of the
brain. But as for you, sweet virgin-man,
oh reign forever the Prince of
Syllabub and Lollypop! And when
you are dead, should we survive your
loss, we'll raise above your grave a
monument of deep regard for your
memory. Darley shall do the design.

<!-- page 259 col 1 -->

A be-pantalooned girl, with a smooth
face and wiry hair, sitting on a volume
of travels, with a bundle of blank verse
in one hand and cake-basket full of
paragraphs in the other. It shall be
modelled in syllabub, dear Mister-Miss,
surrounded with a border of
sugar-plums, besprinkled with pendent
drops of frozen treacle. The
foundation of the monument shall be
of gingerbread; the crest, a rampant
Katy-did. The motto, in especial reference
to your travels, shall be&mdash;'Here
lies the Poet of Twaddle-dom,
whose whole life was characterized by
a pervading vein of Lollypop-itude.'
This is our promise, sweet maiden-man;
therefore we pri'thee pass this
chapter by!*</p>

<p class="small">[*Will the reader pardon this digression of

<p>"Ho, ho, ho!" chuckled Devil-Bug,
as he stood on the verge of the granite
stairway. "Here's dampness, an'
darkness, an' the smell o' bones all
for nothin'. Children under ten years
half price! This feller on my shoulder
don't move nor struggle. Vonder
if he thinks o' th' jolly things we're
a-goin' to do with him? Buried alive!
I do vonders how that 'ill vork!"</p>

<p>With these words, Devil-Bug began
the descent of the granite stairway. The
heavy echo of his footsteps resounded
upward with a dull, monotonous sound,

<!-- page 259 col 2 -->

as lighting his way with the extended
lamp, he went far, far down into the
darkness of the staircase. Once or
twice, as the moaning sound of the
wind came rushing down the passage,
Devil-Bug started with involuntary
surprise, and with his burthen on his
shoulder, attempted to turn round, and
face the enemy, whom his excited
fancy had imagined pursuing his footsteps.
But the unconscious man gave
a faint struggle, and occupied with the
effort to hold him tightly on his shoulder,
Devil-Bug smiled at the moaning
sound of the wind, and with his usual
grimace pursued his way. Down,
down, down! Was not that low
pattering noise the echo of a footstep
at his heels? Devil-Bug smiled grimly
as the fancy crossed his mind.
Down, down, down! The old archway
above the staircase grows crimson
with the light of the lamp, and the
drops of moisture trickling along the
walls, glittered like diamonds in a
river's sands. Was not that faint and
rustling sound the noise of a garment
sweeping the stairs at his back? Half-turning,
Devil-Bug gazed into the
darkness above, but the thick gloom
enveloped the stairway like a pall, and
his solitary eye might discern nothing
but silence and night.</p>

<p>As Devil-Bug turned round, he
tossed the body of Byrnewood rather
roughly on his shoulder, and the
victim uttered a deep groan of pain
and agony.</p>

<p>" 'Oh, groan, little children groan,'
as the nigger wot plays on the banjo
ses, but it won't help you the least circumstance!"
muttered Devil-Bug, with
a hideous grin, as extending the lamp
in his left hand, he grasped his victim

<!-- page 260 col 1 -->

more firmly by the right, and resumed
his downward way. "You see the
opium settled your hash, and the safety
of this 'ere Commonwealth is in
danger! You must be silenced for
the sake of Monk-Hall, so what's the
use o' cuttin' capers? Hello&mdash;wasn't
that a footstep? I'm quite narvous,
as the old women say! Howsomdever,
'ere's the door, the big door wot opens
into the Pit of this 'ere Thea-ter!"</p>

<p>He stood at the foot of the stairway
before the massive door, with timbers
of oak, and bands of iron. Time had
rusted away the lock, and the timbers
in various places, between the intervals
of the iron bands, were crumbling to
decay. Devil-Bug fixed his foot against
one side of the door, and it fell before
him with a crushing sound, whose
echo swelled upward like thunder.</p>

<p>Another moment, and advancing
over a floor of hard clay, he stood in
the Pit of Monk-Hall.</p>

<p>It was a vast and gloomy place, all
full of oaken beams, rising from the
floor to the ceiling far above, with
pillars of dark brick, massive and uncouth
in their outlines, towering at
irregular intervals on every side.
Where Devil-Bug stood, at the foot
of the stairway, with the light of his
lamp flashing fitfully around, a few
prominent features of the cellar or
cavern, were perceptible. The stairway
seemed to descend into the very
centre of the place. On either side,
the irregular light of the lamp disclosed
faint glimpses of massive walls, all
hideous with dark holes and obscure
nooks, while the extent of the cavern
was as uncertain and vague as the
ghostly shadows which flitted from
the hard floor to the distant ceiling far

<!-- page 260 col 2 -->

above. The floor itself was crowded
with rubbish and lumber of all kinds.
Innumerable heaps of broken bottles
gave evidence of the revels held in
Monk-Hall, in the olden time. Crumbling
pieces of timber, heaps of old
boards, and fragments of broken furniture,
littered along the floor, around
the base of the heavy pillars, and
among the uprising beams of oak,
might have excited a momentary curiosity
in the mind less calm and philosophical
than that of the Doorkeeper.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug, however, treated all
these things as matters of course, and
holding the light on high, with the unconscious
Byrnewood on his shoulder,
he picked his way among the heaps
of rubbish and advanced along the
cellar. He had not gone ten feet
from the entrance when a whirring
sound broke upon the stagnant air,
and then the trampling of a thousand
tiny feet echoed to the ceiling of the
cavern. The next instant, a crowd
of rats, whose immense numbers blackened
the cellar for yards around, came
rushing across the path of Devil-Bug,
and with that same whirring noise, in
a moment they were gone again. And
then crawling into the strange glare
of the light, from the heaps of bottles,
and the piles of old lumber, came vermin
and reptiles of all kind, and of
every loathsome shape. Glittering
house-snakes, warmed into life by the
foul air of the vault, hung twining
from the oaken beams, and the brick
pillars were half-concealed by thick
cobwebs, woven by noxious spiders,
who started from their resting places,
as the glare of the light flashed around
the place. Devil-Bug paused in the
centre of a vacant space, extending

<!-- page 261 col 1 -->

between a massive brick pillar and a
rising piece of ground, which, shooting
upward at the distance of a few
yards, closed all the floor of the vault
beyond from view. On either side
were heaps of crumbling lumber and
rubbish, and near the sudden elevation,
thick dust, the accumulation of years
of decay, had gathered ankle deep.</p>

<p>As Devil-Bug laid down the unconscious
form of Byrnewood, placing it
on the hard clay beside the lamp,
which burned dimly under the pressure
of the foul atmosphere, a deep
yet faint and moaning sound broke
on his ears. It was like the rustling
of Autumn leaves driven ashore by
angry waves, or like the rolling of a
deep flood, swollen by a freshet, or
perhaps like the far-off moaning of
wind.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho! That's the underground
stream o' water which flows beneath
the foundations o' Monk-Hall, and
arter rollin' onwards for a few feet,
buries itself in the ground again!
Ugh!" he started as if stricken by
some fearful thought. "I wonder if
<i>his</i> body was carried off by the waves?
This piece o' ground is under the
eastern range o' trap-doors. Let's
see with the light&mdash;yes, yes&mdash;" he
added, rising the lamp overhead.
"Yes, yes! Tender's the archway
with the trap-door o' the Dead-vault
cut into its bricks! He must 'ave
fell somewhere about here," he stamped
his foot violently on the hard clay.
"But I don't see him now, with my
blind side. That puzzles me. For
six long years an' more that feller
has laid by my side, with his jaw
broke and his tongue stickin' out!
Now I don't see him, and <i>that</i> does

<!-- page 261 col 2 -->

puzzle me! Cuss the thing, I forgot
the spade!"</p>

<p>He glanced at the form of Byrnewood
with a mocking laugh.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! Don't be <i>dis</i>-patient
young man," he exclaimed as turning
away from the light he moved toward
the door. "I'll have to go up stairs
for a spade, but I'll be back d'rectly.
'Pon my word I will!"</p>

<p>He disappeared in the darkness, but
in a moment stood beside his victim,
holding a rusted spade in his hand.</p>

<p>"Reether old fashioned this," he
muttered, "I forgot it was down here,
You see my friend, we used it some
years back to bury a gal wot died reether
sudden, as one might say. It's
been a standin' against yonder pillar
ever since. A little bit rusty but it
'ill do!"</p>

<p>While Byrnewood lay prostrate
along the hard clay, with the glare of
the lamp flashing on his face, so wan
and discolored, the blood-shot eyes
starting from the lids, and the white
lips falling apart with an expression
of idiotic vacancy, Devil-Bug coolly
proceeded to dig the grave of the unconscious
though living man, chuckling
merrily to himself, as sticking the
spade into the earth, he paused for a
moment, and spat in his hands, like a
laborer preparing for his day's work.</p>

<p>"I've hung a man in my time on
Bush-Hill, and I've killed a man, by
the trap, and I've buried some few,
and I've stole corpseses for the Doctors,
but I never did bury a man alive!
That's a fact. Not menning any harm
to you but only waiting to see how it
'ill work, I'll jist lay out the grave.
Oh ye begin to be sensible o' yer sitivation
do ye?"</p>

<!-- page 262 col 1 -->

<p>A slight convulsive tremor was visible
on the lip of the victim. His
outspread hands clutched faintly at
the hard clay, and it was evident that
he was making a desperate effort to
rise on his feet.</p>

<p>"This 'ere clay digs hard," calmly
soliloquized the Doorkeeper. "You'd
like to git up, would ye? No doubt.
I should if so be, I was in your place.
What's yer idea-r o' grave-diggin'
anyhow? Werry low business, ain't it?"</p>

<p>Throwing the hard lumps of clay
on either side, he gazed with his usual
hideous grin, upon the face of Byrnewood
Arlington, as like to a corpse as
ever was living man. Byrnewood had
relapsed into his former unconscious
state, and now lay with his fixed eyes
glaring steadily upon the thick darkness
above. Devil-Bug proceeded with
his task. Plying the spade with all
the vigor of his lusty arms, he soon
stood in a square pit reaching to his
knees, while the heap of clay at side of
the grave increased in size. Now
humming a catch of some dismal gallows-bird
song in his grindstone voice,
now muttering gaily to himself, now
filling the old vault with the echo of a
deep and piercing whistle, which he emitted
from his large mouth, puckered together
like the end of a purse, and now
glancing slily aside at the form of his
victim, while that same devil's-grin
distorted his inhuman face, Devil-Bug
made speedy progress in his work.
He soon stood up to his middle in the
grave.</p>

<p>"Hello! What could that be? I
thought I heard the sound o' somebody
breathin' behind yonder pillar.
Or was it you, hey? I'll be ready for
you d'rectly, that I will."</p>

<!-- page 262 col 2 -->

<p>He again resumed his task. As
half-concealed in the grave, he bent
down to his labor, a slight shudder,
like the faint indication of a spasm,
agitated the form of Byrnewood. Then
his hand clutched suddenly against the
hard clay, and in an instant, while his
chest heaved with convulsive throbbings,
he arose into a sitting posture,
and with his long dark hair falling
wildly aside from his wan and ghastly
face, he gazed around the vault, with
an agonized glance that betrayed a
fearful consciousness of his awful situation.
Devil-Bug turned from his
task, and beheld his victim. He
shrieked forth a horrible peal of laughter,
more like the howl of a hyena,
than the sound of a human laugh.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho! Hurray! So ye begin
to diskiver yer sitivation? It's all
werry good that you should know
what's a-goin' to be done with you,
'specially when ye can't help yerself!
How ye sit there, a-starin' round the
cellar, as though you wos about to
buy the primises! Pound me to death
with pavin' stones, but this <i>is</i> a jolly
sight!"</p>

<p>Laying down the spade he advanced
toward Byrnewood. The half-conscious
man shuddered as his torturer
approached.</p>

<p>"Hope ye'll excuse my not havin'
prayers at the grave!" he exclaimed
as he laid his hands upon Byrnewood's
shoulder with a hideous grin convulsing
his features. "You may shudder
young feller, but into that grave
you've got to go, alive and kickin' by
God!"</p>

<p>Devil-Bug swore by the name of the
Almighty, and this was always a sign
of deep excitement with him. His solitary

<!-- page 263 col 1 -->

eye blazed with that instinct of
Cruelty, which was his Soul. Laying
his hand on the shoulders of the shuddering
victim, he dragged him slowly
toward the grave. Byrnewood's lips
parted, he essayed to speak, but the
effort was vain. An incoherent sound,
like that uttered by an enraged mute,
was all that came from his lips.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug dragged along the floor
and held him over the verge of the
grave when a deep groan awoke the
silence of the cellar. Devil-Bug started
as though a dagger had entered his
heart.</p>

<p>"It's <i>him</i>," he muttered dropping
Byrnewood heavily on the floor. "It's
that or'nary feller who's been hauntin'
me for these six years! He always
groans when anything evil's a-goin'
to happen to me. It's him, it's <i>him!</i>
Ha! There he is with his jaw broke
an' his tongue out, and ha! ha!
There's the old woman with the blood
oozin' from the edge o' her broken
skull!"</p>

<p>Leaping over the grave, his hands
outstretched and his solitary eye flashing
with superhuman excitement, he
receded step by step towards the
elevation, which arose above the waters
of the subterranean stream. The
Phantoms were before him, in all their
ghastliness and blood.</p>

<p>As he receded, another groan sounded
through the vault, and entangling
his feet in some object, hidden by the
thick dust which had accumulated on
the piece of rising ground, Devil-Bug
fell heavily on his face. In a moment
he rose on his knees, and was about
starting to his feet again, when a yell
of superhuman horror shrieked from
his lips. As he fell he had tossed the

<!-- page 263 col 2 -->

thickly-gathered dust aside, and he
now beheld the object which had entangled
his feet. A ghastly skeleton,
with the bones falling apart from each
other, lay on the earth, before his very
eyes. The blackened skull, with long
rows of grinning teeth, the orbless sockets
and the cavity of the nose, all crimsoned
by the light of the lamp, touched
his very hand, as he knelt upon the
corner-floor. He started to his feet
with a shriek, followed by another yell
of horror.</p>

<p>"It's him, the man I pitched thro'
the trap," he shouted. "Here he lays
right under the trap-door, here he has
laid for six long years, and now he
wants to murder me! Ugh! He
moves them bony fingers as if to
clutch me by the throat, he grins in
my face, ha, ha! He rises from the
floor&mdash;his bones rattlin' against one
another, and his broken jaw droppin'
blood! I say you devil don't touch
me, don't ye, don't&mdash;&mdash;Ah!"</p>

<p>His soul fired with the sight of the
terrible phantom, aroused into life by
the spectacle of the skeleton of the
murdered man, Devil-Bug retreated
backwards, with his face turned towards
the light, while raising his hands
as high, he aroused the silence of the
vault with another yell of horror. As
the yell broke from his lips, he fell
backward, and was lost in the grave,
which he had dug for another.</p>

<p>No sooner had he disappeared in
the pit than the form of a man sprung
from one side of the brick pillar at
the same moment that the figure of a
woman advanced from the other side.</p>

<p>"Quick Bess, quick I say," shouted
the man seizing the spade. "The
antidote, quick, or all is lost! Apply

<!-- page 264 col 1 -->

it to Byrnewood's lips, while I keep
this monster in his grave!"</p>

<p>Luke Harvey, his snake-like eye
blazing with excitement and his slender
form raised to its extreme height,
stood beside the grave, while Long-haired
Bess, her face flushed and her
dark eyes sparkling with animation,
bent over the unconscious form of
Byrnewood, and applied a small phial
to his clammy lips.</p>

<p>"Hello feller, it was you that
groaned was it?" shouted Devil-Bug
as his hideous face, appeared above the
edge of the grave. "What in the devil
d'ye mean by them sort o' capers anyhow?"</p>

<p>"You infernal monster," shouted
Luke Harvey with an oath. "Make
but an attempt to get out o' that grave,
and I'll crush your skull with this
spade! Quick Bess&mdash;the antidote!
Apply it to Byrnewood's lips, and lead
him from the cellar while I hold this
devil at bay!"</p>

<p>"Joy, joy, he revives!" shouted
Bess gently raising the form of Byrnewood
from the floor. "The antidote
has taken effect. Keep back the monster
another moment Luke, and we
will escape from the vault."</p>

<p>"Ye will, will ye?" cried Devil-Bug
grasping the edge of the grave with
his talon fingers. "Jist wait till I git
out o' this!" His eye glared with a
ferocious gleam, as placing his knees
against the sides of the grave, he began
to crawl from its confines.</p>

<p>"Back devil! You have made the
grave and you shall sleep in it!"
shouted Luke, as raising the spade
above his head, he hurled it full against
the skull of Devil-Bug. "Back devil;
you have met your match this time!"</p>

<!-- page 264 col 2 -->

<p>Stupefied by the blow, Devil-Bug
reeled back backward into the grave.
Luke turned round, and beheld Byrnewood
standing erect on his feet, with
the arm of Long-haired Bess gathered
round his waist, while her shoulder
supported his head.</p>

<p>"Lead him from the vault, Bess!"
exclaimed Luke. "In a moment old
Devil-Bug will recover from the effects
of the blow, and Byrnewood may again
fall into his hands."</p>

<p>"The antidote has restored him physical
but not mental strength!" exclaimed
Bess as her cheek grew deathly
pale with the war of conflicting
emotions. "Ha!" she muttered to
herself as she disappeared into the
darkness of the vault with Byrnewood
walking unsteadily by her side. "Ha!
It was in this vault that Paul Western
fell, when the trap-door sunk beneath
him. Yonder his bones lay uncovered
to the light; and his Murderess beholds
them, and lives!"</p>

<p>Luke stood beside the grave holding
the spade in his hands, while he
gazed upon the retreating figures of
Bess and Byrnewood.</p>

<p>"If I believed in any particular
saint, I think I'd call in their aid just
now! A cursed scrape I'm in again,
all from my disposition to meddle
in other folks' affairs. There I stood,
in front of my room, where I had just
left my character of Brick-Top,
together with the rags and the wig,
when who should tap me on the
shoulder but Bess! 'Byrnewood
Arlington's in danger&mdash;Devil-Bug has
just now borne him to the vaults of
Monk-Hall,' quoth the maiden, and
without stopping to tell me the particulars
she hurries down stairs, like

<!-- page 265 col 1 -->

wildfire! I hurry after her&mdash;old
Devil-Bug is seen far below with a
man on his shoulder, and a light in
his hand&mdash;we creep along stealthy as
cats, close at his heels. He enters the
cellar, places the light on the floor, and
commences his infernal orgies. We
steal behind the brick pillar, and watch
his movements. Bess tells me about
the poison and the antidote; I select
my time for a melo-dramatic groan,
and here lies the result of that groan!
Old Devil-Bug in the grave which he
dug for another!"</p>

<p>A deep groan resounded from the
depths of the grave.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're there, are you?" cried
Luke, as his face darkened over with
an expression of mingled hatred and
rage. "Suppose I try your own game
with you? How would you like to
be buried alive?"</p>

<p>With a mocking sneer playing over
his features, he struck the spade into
the loose earth, and threw several
clumps of hard clay into the grave.
Another groan came echoing from the
pit, and Luke turned his jest into
serious earnest, by throwing one
spadeful of earth after another, into
the grave.</p>

<p>"Oh, groan by all means, it will
do you good!" cried Luke, plying his
spade with renewed energy. "An
elderly gentleman like yourself, who
whiles away his leisure time in burying
folks alive, should hold himself
prepared for any little contingencies
like the present. How are you off for
clay&mdash;eh, Devil-Bug?"</p>

<p>As he spoke, the spade rose and
fell in his active grasp, and his face
warmed with excitement. The beams
of the light fell over his slender figure,

<!-- page 265 col 2 -->

and around the grave, while all beyond
was impenetrable darkness. As
Luke stood on the verge of the grave,
occupied with the use of the spade,
which he plied so rapidly, a swarthy
hand stole quietly from the edge of
the pit, and moved as quietly over the
hard clay, as though feeling for some
object, and in an instant another hand,
with talon fingers, appeared by its
side. Luke did not behold these
hands moving so quietly beside his
very feet, but absorbed in his occupation,
continued to shower the hard
clods into the grave.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" he laughed, as his dark
eye gleamed with excitement. "Old
Devil-Bug little thought of this when
he dug the grave! It was his turn
awhile ago, it's my turn now, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's my turn ag'in!" shouted a
hoarse voice, and the grim face of
Devil-Bug, all streaming with blood,
was thrust from the edge of the grave.
"There's sich a thing as playin' 'possum,
young man!"</p>

<p>He seized Luke by the ankles, and
with all the strength of his iron-sinewed
arms gathered for the effort, flung
him to the earth. In another instant
he had leaped from the grave, and
stood over the prostrate form of Luke
with his iron-hand upraised, while his
eye blazed with rage.</p>

<p>"Take that, feller!" he muttered,
with a deep emphasis, as gathering
all his strength for the blow, he struck
Luke on the head, near the right
temple. Luke saw the blow descending,
and tried to ward it off, but in
vain. The blow descended, and in
another moment, with a faint tremor
quivering through his frame, Luke lay
senseless as a stone.</p>

<!-- page 266 col 1 -->

<p>"Now for the ring!" cried Devil-Bug,
raising the left hand of Luke in
the light. "Ah-ha! Here it is; on
the third finger, and a werry purty
ring it is! He wouldn't part with it
except with his life&mdash;ha, ha! I reether
guess that he'll part with the ring and
his life at wonst!"</p>

<p>Bending over the unconscious form
of Luke, he extended his hands and
fastened the talon-like fingers around
his throat, with the grasp of a vice.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't give much for yer eyes,
my feller!" he muttered, tightening
the grasp of his fingers, until the face
of the prostrate man grew purple, and
the lids of his eyes, slowly unclosing,
revealed the bloodshot eyeballs starting
from their sockets. "It's my
opinion you'd make a bad subject for
the dissectin' table!"</p>

<p>A deep booming sound like distant
thunder, echoed through the vaults and
chambers of the mansion. Devil-Bug
released his grasp on the throat of
Luke and sprang to his feet. It was
but the labor of a moment to seize the
lamp and rush toward the door of the
cellar. With his muscular right hand
he raised the fallen door from its resting
place, and placing it against the
door-frame, as he stepped upon the
first block of the granite stairway, left
the vault in utter darkness.</p>

<p>In a moment, however, the door
was pushed slowly aside, and the face
of Devil-Bug, all hideous with an expression
of sneering glee, appeared in
the aperture, while his extended hand
flung the rays of the light over the
darkness of the vault.</p>

<p>"He lays beside the grave&mdash;ha, ha,
ha&mdash;and I've got the ring! He lays
alongside o' the grave, and there he'll

<!-- page 266 col 2 -->

rot, until his clothes fall, piece by
piece, from his stripped bones! Ho
ho! The worms won't play all sorts
o' games with his eyes? O' course
not. Nor strip the flesh from his
skull, nor fatten on his lips until the
white teeth grin for joy? Nobody
thinks o' such a thing! Ha! There
goes the gong agin&mdash;I must 'tend to
the wants o' Parson Pyne!"</p>

<p>The incarnate sneer which played
over his countenance, suddenly gave
place to that peculiar expression,
which had agitated his visage an hour
before, in the presence of Parson Pyne
and his fair daughter. What was
the meaning of this expression, it were
difficult to tell, but it drew the eyebrows
down from the protuberant forehead
of Devil-Bug, until the sockets
were nearly hidden by their thick and
uneven hair, it compressed his wide
mouth with an expression as grotesque
as it was determined, while his solitary
eye grew alive with a deadly and glaring
light like the white heat on a bar
of iron. There was revenge in that
expression, and memory and love!
The heart of the monster suddenly became
a chaos, over whose tumultuous
clouds of storms and darkness, a
single ray of light, streaming from the
fair distance, revealed a gentle form,
with arms outstretched in mercy, and
a fair face animated with a smile of
love.</p>

<p>"Nell!" muttered Devil-Bug, between
his clenched teeth. "It's werry
long ago since I saw yer face&mdash;" he
paused suddenly while some dim
memory seemed struggling from the
chaos of his soul. "I don't know
much about it now, but if it is, <i>if it is</i>
I say, then he shall die by inches,

<!-- page 267 col 1 -->

or there ain't no sich person as Devil-Bug!"</p>

<p>He closed the door of the vault, and
all was darkness. Close beside the
grave, cold and stiffening lay the form
of Luke Harvey, with the rats, who
were so soon to hold their revel on his
flesh, already crawling around their
prey, and snuffing their banquet in the
tainted air of the vault. Close beside
the grave lay the skeleton of the murdered
man, mouldering to dust, in
darkness and silence, as it had lain
for years, and the sullen stream of the
vault still rolled moaningly onward,
its sluggish waves chaunting a rude
death-song for the slain. The nooks
and crannies of the vault took up the
echo of the flood, and on all sides a
low-muttered murmur, swelling to the
arching roof above, seemed but the
whispered tones of fiends, chuckling
with glee as they spoke of the murders
done in the Pit of Monk-Hall.</p>

<p>Meanwhile along the rough steps
of granite, Long-haired Bess, supporting
the head of Byrnewood on her
shoulder, while her arm encircled his
waist, endeavored to lead the half-conscious
man, as the distant echo of
voices came muttering to her ear from
the Pit of Monk-Hall, whose door lay
but a few yards at her back.</p>

<p>"He is yet unconscious," she murmured,
as the head of Byrnewood
pressed heavily on her shoulder.
"The stairs are dark, and his footsteps
are faint and trembling, but he
shall yet be saved!"</p>

<p>And thus, in silence and suspense,
she led him up the lofty stairs, until
they stood on the floor of the hall in
front of the Banquet Room. Here his

<!-- page 267 col 2 -->

strength seemed to fail him, but the
brave woman, gathered her arm yet
tighter around his waist, and hurried
him along the stairs leading to the
first floor of Monk-Hall. Then the
massive stairway of the mansion was
passed, and in a few moments Bess
and her charge stood in the darkness
of the hall on the second floor.</p>

<p>"The secret door lies this way,"
she murmured, leading him toward
he northern end of the hall. "The
secret door leading to the Well Room
of Monk-Hall. A private staircase,
built in the walls between the mansion
and the Tower building, leads down
into a narrow entry. This entry once
traversed, he will stand in the Well
Room, which is on the ground floor
of the Tower building. A narrow
door separates him from the yard.
That door passed, the fence scaled,
and a long alley traversed, he will
gain the wide street, he will be saved!
Ha! Devil-Bug approaches, I hear his
footstep on the stairs!"</p>

<p>"My sister, my sister!" murmured
Byrnewood speaking for the first time,
"Ah! I have been entangled in the
mazes of some horrible dream! Where
am I? Whose hand is this upon my
shoulder&mdash;and this darkness, what
does it mean?"</p>

<p>"The antidote has taken full effect!"
cried Bess in a tone of joy. "His
strength is restored! This way sir,
this way!" she continued leading him
toward the secret door. "Down the
private staircase, and through the small
room at its foot, you will enter the
yard of Monk-Hall. Scale the fence
and you are saved! Quick or all is
lost! Ha! Mark you the gleam of that
light, flashing from the stairway along

<!-- page 268 col 1 -->

the entry. Devil-Bug approaches and
all is lost!"</p>

<p>The light flashing up the stairway
faintly illumined the hall. Byrnewood
pressed his hands madly to his brow,
as if in the effort to awake himself
from some horrible dream. Then a
sudden glow flushed over his face, and
with a rude movement of his arm he
flung Bess aside.</p>

<p>"Ha! I remember it all. My sister,
and the drug. It comes like a
lightning flash upon my soul! And
you, you were one of the minions of
the seducer! Back, back, touch me
not! Your hand is as polluted as
your soul!"</p>

<p>"Quick! Pass through the secret
door, and gain the Well-Room or you
are Devil-Bug's prisoner once more!"</p>

<p>"Leave Monk-Hall, and my sister in
the power of the seducer? Never!
Oh Mary my own true sister, I will
save you yet! The villain shall pay
for his crime with his life; your wrong
shall be washed out in the blood of the
seducer!"</p>

<p>Exerting all her strength for the effort,
Bess seized him by the shoulder,
and forced him through the narrow
doorway.</p>

<p>"Quick, or all is lost!" she shrieked.
"Before God I swear to rescue
your sister from the foul den of Monk-Hall!
Away, away!"</p>

<p>As she spoke the light grew more
vivid along the stairway, and Devil-Bug
stood on the floor of the Hall. At
a glance he beheld Bess and the form
of Byrnewood, as he stood in the narrow
door. He hailed them with a yell,
and holding the light in his hand rushed
wildly forward.</p>

<p>"Now will you fly?" shouted Bess.

<!-- page 268 col 2 -->

"Delay one moment longer, and your
life is in this monster's power! Your
sister is lost forever. Away!"</p>

<p>"I go!" shouted Byrnewood, as
his wan face, reddened with a gleam
of excitement. "But I will return
again, with the power to avenge my
sister's wrong! Let the seducer and
his minions make the most of their
hour of crime! My hour will come,
and my sister's wrong shall be washed
out in her seducer's blood!"</p>

<p>Bess hurried him through the doorway,
and his footsteps were heard upon
the stairs. Devil-Bug stood before the
tall woman, his face darkened by a
hideous frown.</p>

<p>"Well you she-devil, so you've let
that feller escape have ye?" he muttered
as he approached her, with a
look that boded no good.</p>

<p>"He has escaped, thank heaven he
has escaped!" cried Bess as her dark
eye fired with triumph, while her
proud form towered to its full stature.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug made no reply, but folding
his arms across his chest, with the
light in one hand, he inclined his head
to one side, as if in the act of listening
to some far-off sound.</p>

<p>In a moment a crushing sound, like
the peal of musquetry, came thundering
up the private staircase.</p>

<p>"D'ye hear that?" shouted Devil-Bug
as his eye flashed with an expression
of malignant triumph. "D'ye
hear that sound, g-a-l? Ho, ho, ho!
Yer feller passes down the stairs, he
passes the entry, he crosses the room,
ha, ha, ha! In the centre of that
room, is the old well of Monk-Hall kivered
with loose boards! Yer feller
tries to cross that room, ho, ho, ho!
The loose boards don't give way beneath

<!-- page 269 col 1 -->

his feet? What does that crash
mean? You've made a purty spot of
business of this matter, I do declare!"</p>

<p>"Great God! He is lost!" cried
Bess turning white as a sheet in the
face. "But I will save him yet&mdash;"
she cried opening the secret door.
"Even yet I will foil ye, monster and
devil that you are!"</p>

<p>"Werry likely g-a-l, werry likely,"
exclaimed Devil-Bug quietly interposing
between her form and the door.
"But jist now you'll retire to yer
apartments. Arter this minnit consider
yerself a pris'ner. Go home
Bessie&mdash;" he continued with his habitual
sneer. "Go home little g-a-l,
yer mommy's got short cakes an' coffee
for supper. She wants you&mdash;don't
you hear her callin'?"</p>

<p>Bess calmly folded her arms, and
while a dark frown marred the beauty
of her countenance, she moved slowly
toward the staircase of the mansion.</p>

<p>"Fine gal, that!" chuckled Devil-Bug,
eyeing her retreating form.
"Only she takes too much opium in
her brandy, now an' then. But Bess
is a screamer, when her dander is riz;
a reg'lar hell-cat for all sorts o' devilment&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bess slowly turned her head over
her shoulder, and with her eyes flashing
with concentrated rage, whispered
a single name.</p>

<p>"Paul Western!" she exclaimed
with her eyes fixed on Devil-Bug's
face.</p>

<p>"What d'ye mean by that? Hey,
you she-devil?" cried Devil-Bug, advancing
with a threatening gesture.</p>

<p>"What do I mean?" echoed Bess
with a bitter sneer. "Why I mean
that your account is almost full! The

<!-- page 269 col 2 -->

blood of Paul Western clings to your
skirts, and look there Devil-Bug,
look there!" she exclaimed pointing
to the vacant air at his back&mdash;"Do
you not see his skeleton, standing at
your shoulder? Look, look! The
long bony fingers are grasping for
your throat&mdash;"</p>

<p>Devil-Bug turned round with an involuntary
shudder. When he looked
toward the stairway again, Bess had
disappeared.</p>

<p>"That g-a-l is a born devil!" he
muttered. "Howsomdever I'll go
down stairs and see if that feller is
ralely done for!"</p>

<p>He disappeared through the private
door, and for a few moments, the
Hall was wrapt in darkness.</p>

<p>"All right, jist as if I'd done it myself!"
he cried as he was again visible
through the aperture of the doorway.
"The boards all broke and
smashed, and a heap o' clothes flutterin'
and movin' near the bottom of the
well!"</p>

<p>He laughed with ungovernable glee,
but in a moment the expression of his
hideous face, was shadowed by a heavy
frown.</p>

<p>"The g-a-l," he muttered. "Here
I've been foolin' my time away with
trifles, when, when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>As he spoke he entered the door of
Dr. Pyne's ante-chamber.</p>

<p>"IS it not beautiful my child? Is it
not beautiful?"</p>

<p>As he spoke, with his knees spread
very wide apart from each other, and
the cup of coffee placed on one knee,
the Reverend Doctor, waved the silver
spoon to and fro, nodding all the
while, and glancing with a curious
look at the fair face of Mabel, who
was seated opposite. We say curious
look, because he was a good Minister,
and it would not do, to call that sensual
glance, gleaming through half-closed
eyelids, humid with unhealthy
moisture, by its proper name.</p>

<p>"What is beautiful?" asked Mabel,
as she raised the cup of coffee to
her lips.</p>

<p>"To think that a berry should grow
in the ground," continued Alamont
Pyne, glancing aside at the face of
his daughter, while he beat a tattoo
on the saucer with the end of the
spoon. "To think that a berry should
grow in the ground, and that, that
simple berry, by a mysterious decree
of Providence, should in the course
of time, assume the appearance of a
cup of coffee!"</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Pyne raised his watery
eyes heavenward, but in an instant
as though impelled by some
strange charm, he fixed them upon
the face of Mabel, with that same
gloating expression of fatherly affection.
<i>Fatherly</i> affection, by all
means.</p>

<p>"Drink your coffee, my love,
drink, it will do you good!" said the
Rev. Pyne with an unctuous fatness

<!-- page 270 col 2 -->

of voice. "Nothing like coffee to
raise your spirits, 'specially," he added
in a cheerful whisper, " 'Specially
when it is spiced with a drug or two."</p>

<p>"I feel so strange, father," exclaimed
Mabel passing her white hand over
her brow. "There is a burning sensation
on my forehead, and my eyes
pain me. Oh father, can I indeed be
going mad? The room is filled with
strange forms, and I feel as though
an invisible hand was dragging me
over a frightful precipice&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her dark eyes suddenly assumed
a wild and unearthly light. In an instant
the lids seemed to have shrunken
away from the eyeballs, and each
eye, dilating to an unnatural size, assumed
a strange lustre, rendered
more apparent and striking by the
utter paleness of the countenance,
with a single vivid spot of red, crimsoning
the centre of each swelling-cheek.
Even the lips of the maiden
assumed an unnatural hue. Suddenly
their moist vermilion changed
to a warm and unhealthy purple.</p>

<p>"Father, father," she cried, "I am
going mad! For God's sake, save
me, save me! The room sinks from
beneath my feet, the air is filled with
horrible phantoms, and&mdash;oh save me,
save me!"</p>

<p>She fell back into the chair, and
covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>"This is the first stage of the potion,"
blandly whispered Dr. Pyne,
as his red face, with its rubicund
cheeks, flushed all over with deep
crimson, assumed an expression of the
most decided character. "At first she
will be frightened, then she will fall
into a gentle doze, and then, ah then!"
He took her fair white hand within

<!-- page 271 col 1 -->

his own, and patted it playfully against
his oily cheek. "No one shall hurt
you my child. Your papa is with
you. Go to sleep, that's a dear, Mabel."</p>

<p>Her form thrown back in the chair,
with the limbs disposed in a careless
and therefore voluptuous position.
Mabel gazed at her father with a wild
stare as though she did not comprehend
the meaning of his words. She
looked supremely beautiful, as with
her dark hair, falling in heavy masses
aside from her pale face, she surrendered
one hand to her father, while
the other rested upon the white skin
of her neck, just where it began to expand
into the virgin bosom.</p>

<p>"I gave Devil-Bug three potions,
sometime ago," muttered Dr. Pyne, as
he drew his chair to the side of the bewildered
girl. "One kills, the other
makes crazy, the third makes love;
or rather disposes a sweet young girl
for the exercise of that delightful sentiment."</p>

<p>"Father, look, look! There, at
your very shoulder, stands a skeleton,
winding a grave-shroud round
your limbs! Oh, father, for Heaven's
sake, do not suffer it to stand there
with its bony fingers on your cheek."</p>

<p>"Ugh! The girl scares the life out
of one!" cried Dr. Pyne, jumping
from his chair. "Ah-ha! She begins
to doze! How beautiful! That pale
face, so round in its outlines, with the
spot of red on each cheek, those lips&mdash;they
change from purple to red
again&mdash;falling slightly apart, that
glimpse of a soft bosom&mdash;Ah-ha!
She <i>does</i> begin to doze&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mabel's head dropped lightly on
her shoulder, and her eyelids slowly

<!-- page 271 col 2 -->

closed. Her long dark hair fell
showering over her white shoulders.
Her arms sank stiffly by her side.
She lay silent and motionless as
though suddenly stricken by the hand
of death.</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Pyne rose slowly
from his seat. He smacked his lips
with unctuous fervor, and then taking
his watch from the fob, he strode
quietly up and down the room.</p>

<p>"This is the second stage of the
potion," he whispered, looking at the
watch. "The third stage is the most
delightful of all. That paleness will
give place to a peach-like bloom, that
stiffness of limb will be overcome by
a voluptuous languor, that closed eye,
when its lids again unclose, will fire
with passion and flash with all the bewitching
softness of a woman's love!
It now wants ten minutes of twelve
o'clock. At twelve, the dear child
will be in my power. The care and
trouble of seventeen years will be well
repaid. Ah-ha! I remember; I have
to preach the Anniversary Sermon of
the Gospellers on Christmas night,
let me think it over!"</p>

<p>Mabel still lay silent and unconscious,
her hands dropped listlessly
by her side, while her cheeks were
pale and colorless as death.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," soliloquized the pious
Dr. Pyne. "I might touch up the
Gospellers on that score! I might
talk of my wonderful conversion, my
sudden reform, my glorious change
from darkness to light. Yes, brethren
and sisters," he continued, striking an
attitude as though surveying his congregation
from the height of the pulpit.
"Seventeen years ago, I was a
poor miserable wretch, destitute at

<!-- page 272 col 1 -->

once of a good coat, a pure knowledge
of the Bible! Now brothers, now
sisters, behold me, behold the wonderful
reform, all accomplished by pure
Patent-Gospel grace! (Ha! Mabel revives!
Her eyes slowly unclose and
her lips fire with passion!) Seventeen
years ago I was a ragged loafer,
a leprous wretch, hiding in dark corners
in the day, and sleeping in the
gutters at night! Now brethren&mdash;and
you, my dear sisters&mdash;behold the
change! A change of heart and a
change of linen! I walk the streets
in the day, clad in fine broadcloth;
at night I sleep on a bed of down, and
my conscience, brothers and sisters,
oh it is peaceful, calm and peaceful!
Easy, quite e-a-s-y, I assure you!
And this, my children&mdash;" his red
round face assumed an expression of
deep pathos&mdash;"is all the work of Patent-Gospel
grace!"</p>

<p>Subsiding from his pulpit attitude,
the good brother approached the unconscious
girl. A warm glow brightened
freshly over her pale face, and her
dark eyes half-closed, gave forth a
sparkling glance, moistened with passion.
While the pious minister stood
gazing upon her, with a look as pure
as the glance from the bloodshot eye
of a Satyr, her form relaxing from its
rigidity of muscle, began to assume
the flowing outlines of voluptuous
beauty. She grew radiant with passion.
The red lips, slightly parted,
revealing the teeth like pearls, the
young bosom heaving with life, the
face warmed with a burning flush, and
the eye, large, dark and lustrous,
humid with the moisture of passion&mdash;alas
for Mabel now! The potion administered
 by the good Doctor Pyne,

<!-- page 272 col 2 -->

had aroused her animal nature into
life, and she stood disclosed, a breathing
image of that voluptuousness
which is at once the charm and the
curse of woman.</p>

<p>"Come kiss your father," said Dr.
Pyne, extending his arms towards the
girl. "That's a good child. Kiss
your papa!"</p>

<p>Mabel gazed upon him with wandering
glance. It was evident that while
her animal nature was aroused into
full development, her intellectual
powers were for the moment crushed,
if not utterly broken. The glance
which rested upon Dr. Pyne's face
was humid with passion, but it was
the glance of an idiot.</p>

<p>"The potion works like a miracle!"
murmured the Parson, as his rubicund
face warmed with a ruddy glow, while
his watery eyes, with the veins of
each pupil filled with discolored blood,
stood out from their very sockets, with
a look of gloating admiration. "Come
and kiss your papa, Mabel! It was
a good girl, that it was, and it must
kiss its papa!"</p>

<p>Like one arising in their sleep, Mabel
arose from the chair, and extending
her arms, advanced to her father's
side. Her footsteps trembled as she
walked. Still the flush brightened in
her cheek, still the glance, flashing
from her dark eye, grew more soft
and mellowed with the moisture of
passion, still her fair young bosom
rose heaving from beneath the folds
of her night robe.</p>

<p>She extended her arms and kissed his
lips.&mdash;Faugh! Those lips were gross
and sensual, though they <i>were</i> a Parson's
lips! She kissed his lips again,
and yet again. She laid her soft

<!-- page 273 col 1 -->

cheek against his face she encircled
his neck with her round arms; he
felt her tiny fingers playing with the
thin locks of his hair. The Parson's
face grew more crimson, and his arms
gathered more closely around his
daughter's waist.</p>

<p>"It is a good child, so it is,"
whispered Doctor Pyne, kissing her
red lips. "And it will come and sit
on papa's knee, so it will!"</p>

<p>He drew the fair girl to his knee, his
watery eyes grew more sensual in
their gaze, and his arms gathered
more closely round her waist.</p>

<p>"What a blessed thing it is, to possess,
a knowledge of medical science,
however slight!" And Dr. Pyne kissed
the red lips of the girl, with priest-fervor.
"Here she was, an hour
ago, full of intellectual energy! Now,
ho, ho, her mind is laid to sleep for
a little while, and all the animal portion
of her nature, is aroused into active
life. Quite active! A good potion
that! A-h&mdash;" the good Dr.
Pyne tasted the freshness of her lips
again.</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha! Ha!" Dr. Pyne started
with a sudden thrill of horror, as
that maniac laugh broke on his ear.</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha! Ha!" The girl started
to her feet, and while her swelling
cheeks flushed with animation, and
her dark eyes seemed to swim in liquid
fire, she stood erect upon the
floor, her extended hands pointing at
his face, with a maniac-gesture.</p>

<p>"Mabel, my child&mdash;" the Dr. began,
as he rose from his seat.</p>

<p>"Ha, Ha, Ha!" shrieked the girl,
as with that same unearthly look she
gazed steadily in the face of the good
Parson.</p>

<!-- page 273 col 2 -->

<p>"What can all this mean? Certainly
the child has gone mad! Mabel,
my dear, come to your pa-pa!"</p>

<p>Still the girl stood erect, her form
raised to its full height, her eyes gathering
new fire every instant, her
cheek, blooming with unnatural freshness,
while her extended hands, with
the long fingers trembling in the light,
pointed fixedly in his face. Oh how
beautiful the picture&mdash;a vivid impersonation
of beauty, mere animal loveliness,
yet still bewitching loveliness,
utterly deprived of intellect! The
long dark hair falling over the shoulders,
the erect attitude, the extended
arms, and the flowing robes of snowy
white, the large dark eyes, dilating
very instant, and swimming in a
strange light, the pale face with the
burning freshness in the centre of each
cheek, the red lips and the young bosom
rising faintly into view. Oh
beautiful as a dream, and yet more
terrible than death!</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>Dr. Pyne turned pale. The laugh
sounded like the shriek of his evil
angel.</p>

<p>"Come girl no more of this!" He
advanced fiercely toward the maiden.
His hands were clenched, and his
brow was darkened by a frown. "No
more of this! Your shrieks will
arouse the neighborhood. I have
trifled too long!"</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha! Ha!" Louder and
more terrible arose that shriek of maniac
laughter.</p>

<p>"Now for the reward, for which I
have waited seventeen long years!"</p>

<p>He seized the maiden by the shoulder,
and with one rude grasp tore the
night robe from her bosom. The

<!-- page 274 col 1 -->

white fragments fluttered in his hands.
Another moment and his arms were
around her waist: his foul lips stained
her bosom with a kiss.</p>

<p>A wild light flashed from the eyes
of the girl. Her cheek grew pale as
death, and then crimson as the dawn!
Her soul was struggling with her animal
nature! She tossed her arms
aloft, she tore her form from the embrace
of the priestly villain, she tried
to cover the round globes of her bosom,
with outspread fingers of her
fair white hands.</p>

<p>"Damnation!" shouted the Preacher,
as his round face grew purple
with rage.</p>

<p>"You shall not foil me this time!"</p>

<p>Maddened with lust and rage he
advanced, he gathered the quivering
waist of the girl within his vigorous
arm. She struggled and writhed, and
leapt from her very feet in the effort
to tear herself from his grasp. He
raised his clenched hand and&mdash;oh villain
and dastard! He struck her to
the floor! Her white bosom received
the blow. Along one round and
snowy globe, a dark streak of purple,
burst from the skin, and stamped the
traces of his violence.</p>

<p>She lay prostrate on the floor, her
breath heaving with convulsive gasps,
her form quivering like a leaf, her
cheek white as marble. He knelt by
her side. He, the profaner of God's
sacrament, the violator of God's truth,
the blasphemer of God's name! He
knelt before the crazed girl, he gathered
her form in his arms, he kissed
her death-cold lips. One more effort,
sweet Mabel! With one convulsive
bound she sprang from his embrace,
again sunk kneeling on the

<!-- page 274 col 2 -->

floor, and raised her hands and eyes
to heaven.</p>

<p>"OH MOTHER," she cried in tones
that would have melted the heart of
the fiend in hell, "OH MOTHER,
SAVE YOUR CHILD!"</p>

<p>And her eyes were upward cast, and
her hands were outstretched as if to
grasp the phantom-form, which her
crazed fancy beheld floating in the
darkened air.</p>

<p>"You cannot escape me now!"
shouted Pyne in a voice grown hoarse
with passion. "Mine you are by
heaven, and mine by hell! Ho, ho,
my beauty! You ran away from my
house did you? You placed my character
in jeopardy, did you? Ho, ho
my beauty, we'll see who's master
now!"</p>

<p>He rushed toward the girl. She
rose from the floor, and retreated toward
a dark corner of the room. Her
face turned over her shoulder, her
long dark hair floating down her
back, the white hands clasped over
her bosom, she fled wildly forward;
her foot became entangled in the carpet;
she fell prostrate on the floor.</p>

<p>A gleam of malignant triumph shot
from the Preachers eyes.</p>

<p>"I have you at last!" he muttered
as he knelt by her side. His watery
eyes grew expressive with a look of
gloating admiration. For a moment
he gazed upon the girl in silence. She
lay prostrate upon the floor, her form
quivering with a slight convulsive
motion, while she gazed upon his face
with her large black eyes dilating in
an expression of utter horror.</p>

<p>"Oh tremble, trem-b-l-e!" whispered
the good Dr. Pyne. "It does
me good to see you laying there, helpless

<!-- page 275 col 1 -->

as a baby! You may cry for
help no one will hear you! You
may attempt to escape but the doors
are locked! Tremble, oh trem-b-l-e!"</p>

<p>The girl shuddered as the full sense
of her danger broke upon her clouded
reason. Still she lay prostrate on the
floor, her face pale as death, while
she gazed upon the Parson, in helpless
terror.</p>

<p>"Save me mother&mdash;oh save me!"
she muttered in a low whisper, as if
talking to a spirit.</p>

<p>"Your mother can't save you now!
You must come to your pa-pa, my
love!" He bent down and gathered
her form in his arms.</p>

<p>"Save me, mother," shrieked Mabel,
"Oh save me mother!"</p>

<p>"You are mine! You are&mdash;" began
the Parson in tones of exultation,
when his arms suddenly relaxed their
hold, and his fat form rolled senseless
on the floor.</p>

<p>"G-a-l you called yer mother, and
that call saved ye!" said a rough
voice. Mabel looked up, and shrieked.
Devil-Bug in all his hideous deformity
stood at her side. His face was convulsed
with an expression of fearful
hatred, and his long talonlike fingers
worked as with an epileptic spasm.</p>

<p>"Here Glow-worm, here Musketer,"
he shouted, "Drag this old porpis'
into the next room!"</p>

<p>The negroes came stealing through
the small doorway of the apartment.
They seized the unconscious form of
the Reverend Pyne, and bore him into
the ante-chamber. Devil-Bug was
alone with the fair girl.</p>

<p>He stooped slowly down, while she
shuddered in horror, at the sight of his
hideous visage. He gathered his rough

<!-- page 275 col 2 -->

arms around her tender form; he
raised her from the floor. She shrieked
with affright. Devil-Bug trembled
from head to foot. Stepping softly
over the floor, he bore her to the bed,
and laid her gently on its coverlid.
Mabel's dark eyes grew lustrous with
terror.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug stepped backward from
the bed. He gazed upon her face for
a moment in silence. His huge mouth
was fixedly compressed, and his large
nostrils quivered with a nervous movement.
His solitary eye glared upon
the face of the girl with a fearful intensity.
She was thrilled to the very
heart with a strange awe.</p>

<p>A wild cry burst from his lips. It
was like the howl of an enraged beast
holding the hunters at bay. Again
that cry! He rushed fiercely toward
the bed. Mabel started up in involuntary
affright. Devil-Bug struck his
huge hands violently against his forehead,
and uttered that terrific howl
yet again. Then turning on his heel,
he fled madly from the room.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br/>

<p>CHAPTER TENTH.</p>

<p class="small">PARSON PYNE HAS A GOOD LAUGH TO
HIMSELF.</p>

</div>

<p>THE portly form of Parson Pyne
lay on the carpet of the ante-chamber,
with a huge negro watching on either
side.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug rushed madly into the
apartment and stood beside the form
of the unconscious Preacher. His
solitary eye glared with all the malignity
of a devil, as its glance rested

<!-- page 276 col 1 -->

upon the round and rubicund face of
the Parson.</p>

<p>"Here, yo' niggers," he shouted;
"d'ye see that couch? Strip off the
bed an' the bedclothes, and lay the
Parson on the sackin' bottom! That's
right, that's right! Now, Musketer,
tie one leg to that bed-post, and Glow-worm,
d'ye hear? You tie his t'other
leg to the t'other bed-post! Sarve his
hands the same way! Ha, ha! He
looks like the letter X in the primer
books!"</p>

<p>The fat form of the parson was extended
on the sacking bottom, with
each leg tightly pinioned by the ankle
to the bed-posts at the foot, while his
extended hands were tied in the same
manner, to the posts at the head of
the couch. He certainly looked like
a very corpulent representative of St.
Andrew's cross. His round paunch
stood out from the sacking bottom in
painful prominence, and his large lips
hanging apart, afforded an interesting
anatomical view of his mouth and
palate.</p>

<p>"Is the poker and the tongs heated
to a white heat?" grunted Devil-Bug,
scowling fiercely in the faces of his
negroes.</p>

<p>"Yes, massa," cried Glow-worm,
as he raised the tongs in the light,
with its point heated to a glaring white
heat.</p>

<p>"Dis do, massa?" cried Musquito,
producing the poker, whose jabbed
point, also heated to a white heat,
emitted a fierce and blinding glare.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" said Parson Pyne,
faintly, as he unclosed his eyes.</p>

<p>"Why you see, Parson, I wanted
to axe you a few questi'ns, and bein'
afeer'd you wouldn't answer 'em

<!-- page 276 col 2 -->

quite easy, I jist tied yo' to that bed,
and got a couple o' first rate lawyers
to plead with you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lawyers?" echoed Parson Pyne.
"Ha! I am tied to the bed. What
d'ye mean, ye villain? Where are
your lawyers?"</p>

<p>"Here they is, Parson!" exclaimed
Devil-Bug, and the two negroes, holding
the heated irons in their hands,
stood by the bedside.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" the involuntary groan was
forced from the lips of the pinioned
parson. "Villain, d'ye mean to murder
me?"</p>

<p>"No, not 'xactly. I only wants to
axe ye a few questi'ns. If so be, you
refuses to answer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I refuse to answer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why then I'll burn your eyes out
o' your head!" replied Devil-Bug, his
solitary eye flashing with concentrated
hate.</p>

<p>Parson Pyne was silent for a moment.
He looked at the huge negroes
by the bedside and a cold shudder ran
over his fat person.</p>

<p>"What are your questions?" he
faintly asked.</p>

<p>"Is that gal in the next room your
darter?" exclaimed Devil-Bug, bending
his head down to receive the answer.</p>

<p>"She is," responded the Parson, in
a firm tone.</p>

<p>"That's a big a lie as ye ever did
tell," growled Devil-Bug. "I see we
can't git no truth out o' yo' without
the lawyers. Take off his shoes an'
stockin's, Glow-worm!"</p>

<p>"Dev-i-l," muttered Parson Pyne,
with a violent struggle to extricate
himself from his uneasy position.
"You shall dearly pay for this insolence!"</p>

<!-- page 277 col 1 -->

<p>"Werry likely," responded Devil-Bug.
"But for the present we'll attend
to business."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Glow-worm flung the
shoes and stockings of the Parson on
the floor, and his bare feet, with the
toes thrust upward, were exposed to
the light.</p>

<p>"Tighten them cords round the
ankles," muttered Devil-Bug. "Now
Parson, for the last time&mdash;will yo'
answer all my questi'ns in regard to
that darter o' yours? And ricollec',
Parson, yer not among the Patent-Gospel
fellers <i>now!</i>"</p>

<p>Pyne made no answer, but gazed
in the face of Devil-Bug with his
watery eyes distended by an expression
of utter amazement.</p>

<p>"Gi' me the iron!" exclaimed
Devil-Bug, as he took the heated poker
from Musquito's hands. "Now, Parson,
vich eye do yo' valley most?"
He held the jagged point of the iron
within an inch of the Parson's right
eye.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;o-h," screamed Parson Pyne,
as the heat of the iron shot a terrible
pang through his very brain. "Take
care, take care! You'll burn out my
eye! Oh, o-h!"</p>

<p>"That I will!" grunted Devil-Bug,
as the gaze of his solitary eye grew
like the white heat of the iron.
"H-i-s-s! h-i-s-s! Parson don't yo'
feel the jagged pint hissing into yer
eye already?" He held the iron within
a half-in-inch of the Preacher's
right eye.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;o-h!" roared the Parson, as
his brain was penetrated by the fierce
heat of the iron. "I'll answer, I'll
answer! Take the iron from the
room and I'll answer."</p>

<!-- page 277 col 2 -->

<p>Devil-Bug grinned hideously.</p>

<p>"You'll answer, will ye? I guess
I got yo' on the anxious bench that
time! Souse them irons into that
bucket o' water, niggers! Now, Parson,
with regard to that darter!"</p>

<p>Parson Pyne glanced cautiously
aside. He beheld the negroes in the
act of plunging the hot irons into a
bucket of water. The hissing sound
emitted by the irons as they sank beneath
the water broke, like the voice of
a friend, on his ears.</p>

<p>"Go to the devil!" he shouted, in
a tone of husky rage. "You may
kill me, but I will not answer your
questions!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you won't, won't you?" exclaimed
Devil-Bug, as his habitual
grin distorted his features. "What
'ill yo' bet, Parson, that you don't answer
my questions in a minute? And
answer 'em laffin', too?" As he
spoke he walked round to the foot of
the bed, and extended his large hands
until the talon fingers almost touched
the soles of the Parson's feet.</p>

<p>"Monster, you shall pay for this!"
cried the Reverend Pyne, as his fat
face was distended by an expression
of surprise. He evidently gazed upon
the movements of Devil-Bug with
some considerable wonder.</p>

<p>"Now, Parson, for the questi'ns!
And fust o' all, I'll tell you what I
know mesself. Pick yer ears, Parson!
About Christmas Eve, eighteen hundred
an' twenty-five, a man named
Dick Baltzar, with his wife, Sarah
Baltzar, hired rooms in the house o'
the widder Crank, livin' in &mdash;&mdash; street,
near &mdash;&mdash; Street."</p>

<p>"Ha!" the involuntary cry of surprise
was forced from the Parson's lips.</p>

<!-- page 278 col 1 -->

<p>"Wos yo' that man, Dick Baltzar,
or wos yo' not?"</p>

<p>"Go to the devil!" roared Parson
Pyne.</p>

<p>"Oh, werry well, wer-r-y well!"
exclaimed Devil-Bug, as he gently
touched the soles of the Parson's feet
with the tips of his talon fingers. "I'll
tune you up, my pianey fortey, I will!
Ho, ho! How d'ye feel, Parson?"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!" roared the Parson,
with an outburst of spasmodic laughter,
the result of the titillating movement
of Devil-Bug's fingers along the soles
of his feet. "Ha! ha! ha! Ho! ho!
ho! Oh-oh-oh! Hi! hi! hi! Oh for
God's sake don't d-o-n-t! Hoo!
hoo! hoo!" And the fat form of the
Parson wriggled, and strained, and
heaved, as with an epileptic fit.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho! My pianey fortey!"
cried Devil-Bug, executing a flourish
with his finger tips upon the delicate
soles of the Parson's feet. "I'll tune
you up, I will! Laugh, Parson, it 'ill
do you good, laugh, I say!"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha-a!" roared the Parson,
making a desperate effort to withdraw
his feet from the touch of the
talon fingers. "Ho! ho! ho-o! Hi!
hi! hi! Oh mer-cy! For God's sake
don't ye tickle&mdash;tickle me! Hurrah!
Ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" roared Devil-Bug, executing
another flourish.</p>

<p>"Hah! ya-hah!" shouted Glow-worm.</p>

<p>"Ya-hah-ha-yah!" echoed Musquito.</p>

<p>"Go it my pianey fortey!" cried
Devil -Bug, with a most effective
flourish. "Jist see how my fingers
go over these white soles! Ha! ha!
Parson, you save souls; I tickles em!

<!-- page 278 col 2 -->

'Gently over the stones, driver!'
E-a-sy, I say!"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha-a-a!" roared the
Parson, as he grew black in the face,
while his watery eyes started from
their sockets. "Ho! ho! ho! Oh,
for God's sake&mdash;hoo! hoo! hoo!
Don't ye tickle&mdash;ha! ha! ha! Tick-l-e,
tick-l-e me! Hurrah! hi! hi! hi-i-i!"</p>

<p>"Wot a spektikle for the Free Believers!
Ha, ha! Jist see the Parson
wriggle! Wos there ever sich twistin'
as that! How black he grows in the
face! His eyes big as Delawar' bay
oysters&mdash;ha! ha! ha! Come on my
pianey fortey&mdash;I'll tune yo' up!</p>

<p class="small">Yankey doo-del is the tune&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!" interrupted the
Parson.</p>

<p class="small">"An' nothin' comes so han-dy!<br/>

As yankey doo-del doo-del do-oo&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hoo! hoo! hoo!" roared Parson
Pyne.</p>

<p class="small">"An' yankey doo-del dan-dy!"</p>

<p>Screamed Devil-Bug, executing a
delicate flourish on the soles of the
Parson's feet.</p>

<p>"Ya-hah-hah," roared the negroes,
holding their sides as they beheld the
Preacher's agony.</p>

<p>Wriggling and twisting along the
bed, Parson Pyne made the most
superhuman efforts to extricate himself,
but in vain. Still the finger tips
of Devil-Bug ran softly, oh how softly
along his feet, still he was forced to
rend the air with unwilling laughter.
Tickle, tickle, tickle! Ha! ha! ha!
His face had now assumed a dark livid
hue, and as his eyes hung out from
their sockets, the white surface of each
eyeball assumed a fearful prominence.
Tickle, tic-kle, tic-kle! Ho! ho! ho!

<!-- page 279 col 1 -->

The veins stood out from his forehead
like cords, and his chest heaved and
swelled as though moving under the
impulse of a small steam engine.
Softly moved the finger tips, oh softly,
soft-l-y, soft-l-y! Tic-k-le, tic-k-l-e,
t-i-c-kle! Hoo! hoo! hoo!</p>

<p>"Oh, God! God! God!" yelled the
Parson, as the tears rolled down his
livid cheeks. "Mer-cy! ha! ha! ha!
Ho! ho! ho! Hi! hi! hi! Mer-cy!
Ho-o-o! Ah-a-a-ha-a!"</p>

<p>A wild unearthly shriek burst from
the Parson's lips. Then he blasphemed
the name of his God, then invoked
all the curses of hell upon his
head, and then the white foam frothed
around his lips.</p>

<p>"Do yo' give in?" shouted Devil-Bug
executing a brilliant flourish with
his finger-tips.</p>

<p>"Ho! Ho! Ho!" roared the Parson.
"Ye-s! Ye-s! Hoo! Hoo!
Hoo! Curses ha! ha! ha! curses!
D&mdash;n! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi-i-i!"</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell yo' my feller that
ye'd better not perwoke me?" calmly
exclaimed Devil-Bug, walking round
the foot of the bed. "Now will you
answer them questi'ns?"</p>

<p>Parson Pyne lay silent and speechless.
Poor fellow! He looked quite
pitiful. He lay gasping and panting
for breath, while his livid cheeks and
starting eyes, bore traces of the awful
agony which he had endured. Had
Devil-Bug continued his musical experiments
a moment longer, the Patent-Gospellers
would have lost their
preacher, and the devil gained a soul.
As he lay there, pinioned to the bed,
his starting eyes glaring vacantly
around the room, he looked for all the
world like a man who has been precipitated

<!-- page 279 col 2 -->

over some awful height;
he lay so silent, so motionless, so utterly
blank and speechless. Had the
Pope of Pagan Rome have seen his
Foe, he would have pitied him. Even
the four-and-twenty cardinals would
have wept. The Vatican itself, that
deplorable edifice, would have shed
tears. St. Peter's Church, that object
of Patent-Gospel hate and scorn would
have been convulsed with pity. Alas,
for the Foe of Pagan Rome! To
think that he, the daring and high-souled
Pyne, who had stood up so
often in his pulpit, and defied the Pope
and the devil, who had electrified the
old women with his eloquence, and
convulsed whole churches-full of Gospellers
with his matchless zeal, to
think that he, should have been <i>tickled</i>
into submission!</p>

<p>For ten long and weary minutes
Devil-Bug awaited the recovery of the
Parson. Never was whipped dog
more completely cowed by the lash
than was Parson Pyne by the finger
tips of old Devil-Bug.</p>

<p>"Was you Dick Baltzar, or was
you not? Answer old porpis'!"</p>

<p>"I was," faintly responded the
Parson.</p>

<p>"You rented rooms at the house o'
th' Widder Crank on Christmas Eve,
Eighteen hundred an' twenty-five?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"The widder Crank had a darter?"</p>

<p>"She had."</p>

<p>"Her name was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ellen&mdash;" faintly chirped Parson
Pyne. "I'll tell you all about her.
She had been seduced two years before
I came to the Widow Crank's
house. Her seducer, was a young
merchant named Livingstone. On

<!-- page 280 col 1 -->

Christmas Eve Eighteen hundred and
twenty-four, she gave birth to a female
child. It was called Ellen. A few
days after the child was born, her mother
in a fit of rage drove her from the
house. The child remained with the
widow Crank. It seems that Ellen
and Livingstone had quarrelled soon
after the birth of the child; and the
mother's harshness resulted from her
daughter's confession, that she was
not married to her lover. For one
year no intelligence whatever was
heard from the daughter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha!" shrieked Devil-Bug. "Are
yo' sure o' that?"</p>

<p>"Why as myself and wife, only
came to the Widow's House a year
after Ellen had disappeared, it's hard
for me to tell!" murmured the Rev.
Dr. Pyne. "I never yet, have been
quite certain, but that Livingstone
knew of the girl's whereabouts all the
while."</p>

<p>Devil-Bug smiled grimly to himself.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" he muttered. "Then
I'm the only human bein' as knows
where Ellen was during her absence
from her mother's home!"</p>

<p>"As I said before I came to the
Widow Crank's house, on Christmas
Eve Eighteen hundred and twenty-<i>five</i>.
That very night Ellen Crank
returned home. She was in a very
sad condition you see, and her mother
welcomed her back with tears of joy.
That very night she gave birth to
another child&mdash;"</p>

<p>Devil-Bug leaned slowly forward,
and applied his mouth to the ear of
the Parson. "And that 'ere lost child,
<i>died?</i>" he muttered in a whisper
that thrilled the Parson to the heart.</p>

<!-- page 280 col 2 -->

<p>"Livingstone always thought so,"
said Dr. Pyne in an evasive tone.</p>

<p>"No lyin' Parson! One child
died that night I know! Was it the
first or second?"</p>

<p>"It was the <i>first</i>," answered Dr.
Pyne.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug buried his face in his
hands, and the Parson heard him
groan. The Negroes looked on in
mute astonishment. Their master affected
by anything like a human feeling!
Ha, ha! The thought tickled
them, and they chuckled quietly together.</p>

<p>"And the <i>second</i> child Parson,
whatever becom' of it?" said Devil-Bug
looking at the Preacher through
the outspread fingers of his hands.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Pyne in
a faint voice.</p>

<p>"You lie!" shrieked Devil-Bug,
"You lie! You stole that child Parson,
you and your wife trained it up
with the idea-r of havin' a hold on
Livingstone, when he came into his
father's property! Don't I know ye,
ye fat dog?" he rose from his seat
and seized the Parson fiercely by the
throat. "Yer wife died, and you
turned Parson! Ho! Ho! am I right?
Tell me quick or I'll choke ye!"</p>

<p>"You are&mdash;you are!" cried Pyne
as he felt the talon-fingers of the deformed
wretch gathering round his
throat.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug started up with a wild
howl, and rushed madly into the
chamber.</p>

<p>CHAPTER ELEVENTH.</p>

<p class="small">THE SAVAGE ALONE WITH THE
MAIDEN.</p>

</div>

<p>HIS teeth grating together, and his
hands outspread, while his eye blazed
with a madman's glare, he rushed
toward the bed, whereon the girl was
sleeping. Mabel started up in affright,
and clasped her hands over her bosom,
as she beheld him approach.</p>

<p>"Oh save me now, my God!" she
shrieked and held her breath in very
terror.</p>

<p>"Come g-a-l, come!" cried Devil-Bug
as gathering his arm around her
waist, he bore her quickly along the
room. "Come, I say come!"</p>

<p>He stopped before an antique mirror
of circular shape, which depended
from the wainscotted walls. He placed
Mabel on her feet, and rushing from
her side, seized the light from the
small table near the fire. In a moment
he stood by her side again, and
as she started backward, in utter horror
of his hideous countenance, he
flung the matted hair aside from his
right temple.</p>

<p>"Look gal, look!" he cried pointing
to the reflection of his loathsome
countenance in the mirror. "D'ye
see that red mark along my right temple?
That red mark like a snake?
D'ye see it, d'ye see it? That mark
was born with me!"</p>

<p>Mabel gazed upon him with an expression
of blank wonder mingled
with terror.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug wound his rough arm
round her neck, and swept her thick
black tresses aside from her right
temple.</p>

<!-- page 281 col 2 -->

<p>"Look, look g-a-l look!" he shrieked
as he pointed to the reflection of
her beautiful countenance in the mirror.
"I don't want you to look at
them black eyes, which are like hers,
nor the lips, nor the cheeks! But the
right temple g-a-l&mdash;the right temple!"</p>

<p>Mabel involuntarily gazed within
the mirror. She started back with a
strange feeling of surprise as she beheld
a slight, thin and discolored
streak, marring the beauty of her
face, near the right temple. It was a
faint and delicate copy of the deep red
mark near the swarthy temple of
Devil-Bug.</p>

<p>"That was born with you g-a-l,
that was born with you g-a-l!" shouted
Devil-Bug. "An' you're my&mdash;yes
yes you're my&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused suddenly and fell on his
knees. He placed the light on a chair,
and then looked up into her wondering
face, with his hideous countenance
distorted by a strange emotion.</p>

<p>Then, bending to the very floor, he
clung with his huge hands to the skirt
of her white dress, and impressed his
thick lips upon the shoe of her tiny
foot. Then big tears stole from the
lids of his blazing eye, and from the
shrivelled socket which was destitute
of an eyeball. Then his lips became
fixedly compressed, and as he raised
his clenched hands he uttered a yell,
like the howl of an enraged hyena.</p>

<p>"Oh, mercy, mercy!" shrieked
Mabel, gazing upon the monster at
her feet in utter alarm.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug seized her fair white
hands and looked up into her face in
silence. It was a strange and fearful
picture. The Savage kneeling at the
feet of Innocence!</p>

<!-- page 282 col 1 -->

<p>Her form, so delicate and beautiful
in all its rounded proportions of
maidenly loveliness, with the young
bosom, bared to the light and heaving
with animation, her face so pale and
yet so fair to look upon, with the dark
eyes of such unutterable eloquence,
and the long black hair, falling along
the cheeks and down to the shoulders!</p>

<p>His form, so rough and so uncouth,
with its harsh outlines of deformity
and strength, its broad chest quivering
with strange emotion; his face so
dark, so swarthy and so distorted,
with its protuberant brow, its flat nose,
and wide mouth, its eyeless socket and
its solitary eye, blazing with superhuman
emotion! It was a strange
contrast; the Savage reared in the
very centre of Quaker City civilization,
kneeling at the fair and beautiful
woman, wronged and injured by one
of the professed Ministers of that
civilization!</p>

<p>"Do not, do not harm me!" cried
Mabel, all other feelings absorbed by
the terror which she felt for the strange
being at her feet.</p>

<p>"Harm ye?" growled Devil-Bug,
as he rose from his kneeling position
and forced her gently into a chair.
"Gal, who is it that talks to me of
harmin' ye?"</p>

<p>He seated himself on a chair opposite
the maiden. The light, standing
on another chair, flashed its beams
over the outlines of their faces, so
strangely contrasted to each other.</p>

<p>A wild hope fluttered over the heart
of the maiden, as she beheld something
like human feeling in the solitary
eye of the monster.</p>

<p>"He may aid me to escape from
this house!" she murmured.</p>

<!-- page 282 col 2 -->

<p>"G-a-l, had ye ever a friend?"
And as he spoke he took her fair white
hand within his talon fingers.</p>

<p>"Never!" answered Mabel, as her
heart warmed with a strange sympathy
for the being before her. "My
father has given me food, and clothes,
and shelter, but I never yet looked
upon the face of a human being whom
I could call friend! No mother ever
smiled upon me, and as for my father
oh, for God's sake do not, do not
place me in his power again!"</p>

<p>"The g-a-l's been edicated!" muttered
Devil-Bug. "You never had a
friend, then? You don't remember
your mother? I do, g-a-l, I do!"</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>"Yes, g-a-l, I was your mother's
servant, a-good many years ago. I
used to kiss the very ground she stood
upon. Don't mind me, my dear, if
I talk a little wild. I'm a poor one-eyed
devil, and nobody cares for me!
But I'll be your friend g-al&mdash;I, that
never yet was friend to a human bein'
save one&mdash;I will be your friend!"</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>"Yes, gal, me! I'm ugly as the
devil&mdash;I know it! But for you, gal,
for <i>you</i>, my heart feels warm! Ask
me to hold my hand in that fire for
your sake, jist ask me!"</p>

<p>He reached forth his hand toward
the light as if to carry his words into
action, when a spot of thick red blood
crusting the swarthy skin, attracted
the gaze of his solitary eye.</p>

<p>"Ha! It is <i>her</i> blood," he shouted,
starting from his seat. "The old
woman's blood! The blood of Ellen's
mother! Ha! There she lays with
the red blood droppin' from her holler
skull! There&mdash;there&mdash;" he pointed

<!-- page 283 col 1 -->

fiercely to a vacant spot of the room.
"Don't ye see her, gal? And here,
gal, here, by my side, his jaw back
and his tongue stickin' out, he lays&mdash;<i>he</i>,
jist as he fell through the trap!"</p>

<p>He rushed wildly toward the door,
as the terrible phantoms, in all their
horror, broke anew upon his gaze.</p>

<p>"But I'll be yer friend, g-al!" he
shouted, turning suddenly round. "I,
I, old Devil-Bug will be your slave!
You shall roll in wealth, g-a-l! Parson
Pyne ain't yer father&mdash;not a bit
o' it! Yer father has gold enough to
buy ye a row o' houses! I tell ye,
gal, old Devil-Bug is yer friend! The
man that tries to injure ye will have
a wild beast to fight&mdash;that's all!"</p>

<p>He rushed into the next room
where Parson Pyne still lay pinioned
to the sacking bottom of the bed. The
Herculean negroes watched by the
bedside.</p>

<p>"Put on this feller's shoes an'
stockin's an' let him clear out!"
shouted Devil-Bug. "And look ye,
Parson Pyne! it 'ud be better for you
to crack jokes with a hungry tiger
than to dare touch that gal ag'in!
Go home, Parson Pyne, and mind yer
business, and put down the Pope o'
Rome! The g-a-l shall go to her
father, the rich merchant Livingstone!
Her face is proof enough that she is
Ellen's darter! And mind ye, Parson
Pyne&mdash;" he cried, as he stood in the
doorway, his face darkened by a scowl
of rage. "If yo' ever lay a finger on
that g-a-l ag'in, I'll have my revenge
on you, if I have to drag you from
yer pulpit! I'll have yer blood if I
have to spill it in the sacrament cup!"</p>

<p>He closed the door and rushed madly
down the stairway of Monk-Hall.</p>

<!-- page 283 col 2 -->

<p>"To the vault, to the vault! An'
let me think these things over! My
brain feels kind o' crazy like, and my
blood biles in my veins! Ha! ha!
ha! Old Devil-Bug's darter shall
ride in her carriage, and wear silks
an' satins&mdash;that she shall!"</p>

<p>And as he went down to the vault
of Monk-Hall, his wild and discordant
laughter broke upon the air with a
sound of strange and savage joy.</p>

<p>CHAPTER TWELFTH.</p>

<p class="small">THE FLIGHT FROM MONK-HALL.</p>

</div>

<p>THE negroes were alone in the
ante-chamber. Glow-worm stood on
one side of the fire gazing into the
face of his comrade, who leaned
against the mantel on the opposite
side. Musquito grinned hideously as
he caught the gleam of Glow-worm's
eye.</p>

<p>"Ha-hah! Yah-hah!"</p>

<p>"What fo' you make dat dam
noise?" asked Glow-worm, with dignified
severity.</p>

<p>"It am so dam queer, it am!" replied
the other Insect, with an additional
chuckle. "So berry pertikler,
dam queer!"</p>

<p>"Ha-yah! Yah-ha!" chuckled
Glow-worm, as the idea which amused
his comrade stole suddenly over his
mind. "To tink o' de pa'son bein'
tied to dat ah bed&mdash;yah-hah!"</p>

<p>"Jis like a sof' crab on he back&mdash;ha-yah!"</p>

<p>And the delightful gentlemen chuckled
merrily together, and showed their
white teeth, and held their sides until

<!-- page 284 col 1 -->

the walls of the chamber echoed with
their uproarious glee.</p>

<p>The door leading into the hall of
the second story opened suddenly,
and long-haired Bess entered the
chamber. Her large dark eyes flashed
with a clear and brilliant expression,
and her jet-black hair streaming
wildly over her shoulders gave a
strange relief to her deathly countenance.</p>

<p>"De Lor Jimminy! It am de gal!"
muttered Musquito, with an expression
of idiotic surprise.</p>

<p>"Quick, I say, quick!" exclaimed
Bess, approaching the fire-place. "I
want the keys of the house&mdash;old
Devil-Bug is waitin' for 'em! Where
are they? Quick, I say!"</p>

<p>"Dere dey are, missus!" exclaimed
Glow-worm, with a mock bow, as
he pointed to the bunch of keys resting
on the small table near the light.
"What de debbil yo' want 'em foh?"</p>

<p>Bess seized the keys and rushed
into the adjoining chamber where Mabel
was imprisoned.</p>

<p>"I say, nigga, what all dis mean?"
exclaimed Glow-worm, gazing in
Musquito's face.</p>

<p>"I 'spect dar's some fuss down
sta'rs!" responded the other negro.</p>

<p>As he spoke, Bess re-entered the
room with the form of Mabel, supported
by the embrace of her right
arm, while the pale face of the young
girl, lit by her large and lustrous
eyes of midnight blackness, wore an
absent and bewildered expression.</p>

<p>"Come, this way, this way," whispered
Bess, moving toward the door
which led out into the hall. "This
way and you shall be saved!"</p>

<p>"What foh you do dat foh?" muttered

<!-- page 284 col 2 -->

Glow-worm, fiercely, as he
turned toward Long-haired Bess with
a threatening look.</p>

<p>"Hush, h-u-s-h!" whispered Bess,
as she glanced meaningly at the half-conscious
face of the girl who hung
on her arm. "You see, Glow-worm,
there's a rumpus kicked up down
stairs, and Devil-Bug wants to have
the gal removed to the Tower Room.
Open the door quick, and let me hurry
up stairs with her. You are so stupid
Glow-worm&mdash;quick, I say!"</p>

<p>The look which animated the face
of Long-haired Bess, dispelled all the
doubts which the negro had entertained.
With a mechanical gesture he
flung open the door.</p>

<p>"Now, Glow-worm, close it after
me&mdash;" she said, gazing in his hideous
face, while her tone was that of a confidential
whisper. "And if anybody
should come up here and ask after
the gal, you must swear that she was
never in the house."</p>

<p>"Yes, missus."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! We know how to
manage these things don't we, Glow-worm?"
laughed Bess, as, standing in
the doorway, she gathered her arm
more closely around the waist of the
girl who lay half-fainting, in her embrace.
"It takes us, don't it, Musquito?"</p>

<p>"It jist does dat!" chuckled the
negro, and Glow-worm, joining in his
laugh, carefully closed the door.</p>

<p>Bess stood in the darkness of the
hall. A smile of triumph flashed over
her proud face. She felt the heart of
the girl, throbbing against the hand
that held her form to her side.</p>

<p>"The plot of the Parson and his
tool shall be scattered to the winds!

<!-- page 285 col 1 -->

I will save the wronged girl, save her
from the hands of her <i>priestly</i> father!
This way fair girl, and we will escape
together!"</p>

<p>"Whither are you leading me?"
murmured Mabel in a bewildered tone.
"Oh save me from my father! Do
with me what you will, but do not hurry
me to his roof again! I will work my
fingers to the bone, beg in the streets,
or starve, but&mdash;oh! Do not place me
in his power again!"</p>

<p>Bess silently led the way down the
stairs. Crouching on the steps, about
half-way down, was the form of a
woman, attired in floating robes of
white.</p>

<p>"Mary arise; we will escape!" exclaimed
Bess in a whisper. "Take
my arm, and cling to me with all your
strength: we will escape from Monk-Hall!"</p>

<p>The fair girl rose in the darkness,
and clung to the arm of the fallen
woman. No word escaped her lips;
no sigh heaved her bosom; she was
silent as the grave.</p>

<p>"Ha! I hear the sound of his footsteps
on the lower stairs!" muttered
Bess. "He is ascending from the
vault of Monk-Hall. Now help me
heaven! If he bears a light with him
we are lost! Another moment and all
will be discovered."</p>

<p>She pressed her hand madly to her
forehead, but in a moment an exclamation
of joy burst from her lips.</p>

<p>"Stand close against the wall on
this side of the stairway; I will cover
your form with this cloak!"</p>

<p>They crouched against the wall, as
the sound of Devil-Bug's footsteps were
heard on the floor of the hall below.
Seizing the cloak, which she had left

<!-- page 285 col 2 -->

with Mary, while leading Mabel from
the chamber above, she flung it over
their figures, and stood erect against
its folds, her dark dress, shrouding
her form from view. The sound of
Devil-Bug's footsteps were heard on the
first step of the staircase. There was
barely room for him to pass, between
the form of Bess and the banisters opposite.
He ascended the stairs. Step
by step, he ascended, his hard breathing
breaking on the still air like the
panting of a wild beast about to spring
at the traveller's throat in the darkness
of some hideous ravine. The heart of
Bess fluttered in her throat. Another
step, and he would be at her side. She
held her breath. His foot was on the
step where she stood shielding the
forms of the girls from view. The
light from the distant roof fell dimly
over his hideous face and form, while
the side of the stairway next to the
wall was enveloped in thick darkness.
Bess beheld him turn&mdash;his coarse garments
rustled against her dress. She
placed her hand against her mouth to
smother the shriek which arose to her
lips. The solitary eye of Devil-Bug
peered into the darkness with a fixed
glare. Bess silently grasped the massive
key of the front door in her right
hand, and separated it from the ring
which confined the bunch of keys. In
the action the keys jingled together.
Devil-bug started. Bess raised the
massive key in her hand&mdash;it was her
determination to crush his skull with
its weight, if he laid his hand upon her.
Her lips were compressed, and her
bosom for the moment, was motionless
as marble.</p>

<p>"My heart's full of all sorts o' queer
tantrums"&mdash;muttered Devil-Bug. "I

<!-- page 286 col 1 -->

just now thought I heered somebody
breathin' on the stairs, and
now I thought I heered my keys a
jinglin' together! Wot a rediculus
fool I am to be sure!"</p>

<p>He pursued his way, he passed the
form of Bess, and the sound of his
footsteps presently echoed from the
stairs above.</p>

<p>Bess breathed freely again. A wild
feeling of joy fluttered round her heart:
She seized the trembling girls, one in
each arm, nerved for the effort by a
hallowed hope that now began to
brighten over her soul, she gathered a
fair form in each arm, and hurried
down the stairs.</p>

<p>"The key, the key!" she shouted
in a wild delirium of joy. "A moment
longer and we are saved. A moment
and we escape from Monk-Hall!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile Devil-Bug ascending the
stairs, stood before the door of Monk
Baltzar's ante-chamber.</p>

<p>"I'll see the gal once agin," he
muttered. "I'll look on her purty
face agin; she shall roll in gold; she
shall! Old Devil-Bug's darter shall
have the money&mdash;ha, ha, ha! Sich
lots o' money!"</p>

<p>He entered the ante-chamber, and
passed along without heeding Glow-worm
and Musquito who stood by the
fire. Gently unclosing the door of the
next apartment, he stepped within the
chamber where he had left the girl.
He closed the door and advanced
toward the light.</p>

<p>"She's a-sleepin' on that bed, the
darter of Ellen!" he muttered folding
his arms. "Many and many's the
night I've laid at Ellen's door, watchin'
her while she slept, and keepin' her
from harm. There wasn't never a

<!-- page 286 col 2 -->

human bein' as didn't cuss me, except
one, except <i>one!</i> That was her&mdash;Ellen&mdash;the
gal whom I'd 'ave died for!
And this is her darter&mdash;ha, ha, ha!
And she shall ride in her carriage, and
have goold pieces, thick as flies in a
molasses jug."</p>

<p>He advanced a step nearer to the
bed, his head inclined to one side, as
if in the act of listening. He listened
for the low, soft sound of a woman
breathing in her sleep.</p>

<p>"She sleeps wery softly!" muttered
Devil-Bug. "An' I'll go to Livingstone,
an' I'll tell him the story, and
I'll tear that Parson's heart from his
carcase, if he dares say that she ain't
the merchant's darter! I hate and cuss
the whole world; the whole world hates
and cusses me&mdash;but the g-a-l! I'll
skulk along the street, and see her
ridin' in her carriage; I'll watch in the
cold winter nights and see her&mdash;all
shinin' with goold and jewels&mdash;as she
goes into the theatre, with the big
folks round her, and the rich merchant
by her side."</p>

<p>He drew a step nearer the bed.</p>

<p>"And then I'll skulk down into the
pit, and hide my head, but keep a lookout
on her with my one eye. When I
sees the folks makin' much of her&mdash;the
jewels shinin' on her dress, the bracelets
round her wrists and the goold
band around her white brow, then I'll
stick my face in my hands an' laff!
Ho, ho; ho.&mdash;<i>There</i>, I'll cry to myself&mdash;there
is old Devil-Bug's darter
among the grandees o' the Quaker
City!"</p>

<p>He drooped his head on his breast,
while his eye blazed, and his thick
lips parted in a grotesque grin.</p>

<p>In a moment, however, a strange

<!-- page 287 col 1 -->

mood of thought seemed to pass over
the distorted intellect of this monster.</p>

<p>He stood with his head drooped low
on his wide chest, while his hands
hung extended by his side. His solitary
eye, which contracted and dilated
like the eye of a tiger, grew large and
lustrous. His teeth were clenched,
while his thick lips receded in a convulsive
grimace. He stood motionless
as the aged walls of that old house,
of whose wide rooms and dreary
vaults he seemed the living soul.</p>

<p>In that moment of silence what a
world of thought passed over the soul
of the monster!</p>

<p>First came a vision of the fair woman,
who had loved him. Loved the
outcast of mankind, the devil in human
shape! Could you have seen Devil-Bug's
soul at the moment it was agitated
by this memory, you would
have started at the contrast, which it
presented in comparison with his deformed
body. For a moment the soul
of Devil-Bug was <i>beautiful</i>.</p>

<p>Then the scorn of the world crowded
upon his soul. His ignominious
birth, his lonely life, the hatred was
felt for him, and the loathing which
he felt for man, his distorted face and
deformed body. Like a black cloud
it gathered upon him. Had Devil-Bug's
soul assumed a tangible shape,
his body in comparison, would have
grown beautiful. It was terrible to
note the malice of his soul flashing
from his eye and trembling on his
lip.</p>

<p>Then came one wild and wandering
thought. It darted over the chaos of
his mind like the long and trembling
ray of a star that shines but for an instant
and then is dark forever. It was

<!-- page 287 col 2 -->

a thought, brief it is true, wild and
wandering, yet mighty in its very
brevity of existence, and most glorious
in its wandering shape, it was a
thought of God. Devil-Bug for a moment
felt the existence of a God. For
a moment he felt that he had a Father
in the Universe, He imagined an
awful being, with a face of unutterable
beauty, an awful being looking forth
from a vast immensity of clouds and
darkness, while a frown broke over
his eternal brow. Devil-Bug felt that
this being was his Father. He felt
that he, Devil-Bug the outcast of earth,
the incarnate outlaw of hell, had one
friend in the wide universe; that friend
his Creator. He felt in every fibre
of his deformed soul that the eyes of
the awful being were fixed upon him
in terrible reproof, yet with a gleam
of mercy breaking from their eternal
lustre.</p>

<p>This thought was but for a moment.
Like a flash of light it came, like a
shadow it passed away.</p>

<p>Then, slowly and terribly, there
came gliding to his side, the phantoms
of the murdered man and woman.
The man with the body distorted by
death, the knees drawn up to the chest,
the jaw broken and the tongue lolling
out; the woman, with the blood oozing,
drop by drop, from the hollow skull,
while the fragment of the face, clung
by the quivering neck, to the shattered
and mangled body. Devil-Bug could
see the old woman's flesh quiver; he
could hear the sound of the dropping
blood. Drop! Then a pause. Drop!
Another pause. Drop, drop, drop!
How red it grows as it curdles over
the hard bricks of the fire-place! He
could see the blood-shot eyes of the

<!-- page 288 col 1 -->

man moving slowly to and fro; then
the tongue blackened, and then&mdash;Ugh!
That low-toned yet terrible moan!</p>

<p>"They are with me!" muttered
Devil-Bug, wiping the cold sweat from
his brow. "With me forever! But
I don't see that man Harvey. I don't
see his corpse.&mdash;Ugh! there he is
now, layin' beside the grave, his body
straightened out and his eyes glaring
upward like bits of glass in the sunshine!
He moves&mdash;ugh! He rises
on his feet, he makes toward me!
Ugh! Back I say&mdash;you're dead, yo'
devil, and yo' can't frighten me!"</p>

<p>This was uttered in a low whisper
that would have thrilled a man's blood
to hear. His right arm extended
while the cold sweat trickled from his
brow, Devil-Bug stood immoveable as
a rock, while he regarded the phantom
with a fixed and glassy eye.</p>

<p>"Back yo' devil&mdash;you're dead&mdash;ugh!
Back I say&mdash;yo' can't frighten
me!"</p>

<p>In a moment the fit subsided, and
Devil-Bug gazed around with a wild
shriek of laughter.</p>

<p>"Them things is werry delightful!"
he observed, with his usual grin.
"They quite refreshes a feller."</p>

<p>He approached the bed, and his
mood changed. His child, lay sleeping
there; <i>his child!</i> The darkness,
which shrouded the corners of the
chamber, lay thick around her couch,
but she was <i>there!</i> His heart beat
with a strange feeling of joy as he
approached the bedside, and from his
heart through every vein that strange
joy darted like lightning.</p>

<p>He extended his hand, he passed it
over the bed-clothes. A shudder ran
over his frame. Again he extended

<!-- page 288 col 2 -->

his hand, again passed it nervously
over the white coverlid. He started
backward with a cry of horror.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment silent and
immoveable. Then running from one
corner of the room to another, he
shrieked the name of Ellen, again and
yet again, while the muscles of his
face, worked as with a death-spasm.</p>

<p>"Ellen," he shrieked, in his frenzy
confounding the mother with the child.
"Where have they tuk yo'? Ellen&mdash;did
I not watch yo' in the winter
nights? Did I not fight for yo'? Say,
Nell, was there ever sich a sarvant as
old Devil-Bug? Nell&mdash;Nell! Answer
me Nelly; don't play 'possum with
Devil-Bug&mdash;I know you're hid somewhere;
I know it! You'd not leave
me.&mdash;Nell!"</p>

<p>Again he shrieked that name. He
listened for a moment no answer
came to his call. He rushed hurriedly
into the ante-chamber; he seized the
negro, Musquito, by the throat with a
giant's grasp.</p>

<p>"Tell me, yo' scoundrel, where
did yo' take that gal?"</p>

<p>"Massa"&mdash;replied the negro, speaking
with difficulty as the talon fingers
encircled his throat. "Missus Bess&mdash;took
de keys&mdash;and de gal&mdash;dat's
all, Massa."</p>

<p>"Nigger, I'll have you roasted
alive!" shrieked Devil-Bug, with an
ominous scowl of anger. "Bess took
the gal and the keys, did she? Niggers,
I'll tell you what it is, if that
gal escapes, I'll have your black flesh
torn off with hot pincers&mdash;I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>He rushed through the doorway,
and was heard descending the stairs.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, with the fair form of a

<!-- page 289 col 1 -->

trembling woman on each arm, Bess
pursued her way down stairs, and in
a few moments stood at the small door
of the Doorkeeper's fireroom. It hung
slightly ajar. Bess gazed through the
crevice, and to her utter horror, beheld
two persons standing near the
fire. She looked again, and recognized
the portly form of the fat Parson
and the well-built figure of Fitz-Cowles.
They were chatting pleasantly
together.</p>

<p>"A fine girl you say, Parson? Ha,
ha! You're a sly rogue, you are!
Where is she now?"</p>

<p>"Don't speak so loud, Fitz. She's
up stairs&mdash;a lovely girl, with a soft
form and red lips! Ah!"</p>

<p>Bess could hear the Parson smack
his thick lips together, with holy
fervor.</p>

<p>"Take care Parson, or I'll cut you
out! I'll buy off old Devil-Bug and
have the beauty all to myself. I
know you preachers are awful sly
with the women; and the pulpit is
rather celebrated for its taste in that
line. My curiosity is excited, Parson&mdash;I
should like to see the girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah-ha! Should you? I've had
a good deal of trouble in trapping the
beauty&mdash;she shan't pass out of my
hands for nothing, I assure you."</p>

<p>There was a pause for a few minutes.
Fitz-Cowles and the Parson
whispered together.</p>

<p>Bess looked through the crevice,
while the girls hung trembling on her
arms, and beheld the good Parson in
the act of rattling a dice-box, which
Devil-Bug had left on the mantle.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! The hundred dollars
are mine!" chuckled the Parson.</p>

<p>Bess beheld Fitz-Cowles take up the

<!-- page 289 col 2 -->

dice, and rattling them for a moment
in the box, fling them out upon the
surface of the mantlepiece.</p>

<p>"And the girl is mine!" exclaimed
Fitz-Cowles, with a look of triumph.
"Our agreement was that the one who
had the highest throw should take the
money; the other should have the
woman! Being a Parson, you of
course had more luck with the dice
than one of the laity like myself; I
am content with the girl. Where is
she?"</p>

<p>"Up stairs. My room you know?"
and the Parson waved his hand toward
the door.</p>

<p>Fitz-Cowles moved from the fire-place.
In a moment the door would be
flung open, and Bess, with her companions
be discovered.</p>

<p>"Now is my time!" muttered Bess.
"Girls, stay here for a single moment,
and I'll save you!" She placed them
in the darkness, one on either side of
the doorway.</p>

<p>"The house is on fire!" she shrieked,
as with her dark hair flung wildly
over her shoulders, she rushed
through the doorway and confronted
the astonished Parson and the
Millionaire. "Save yourselves while
it is in your power! The house is in
flames&mdash;away, away!"</p>

<p>She rushed toward the front door
while they stood utterly confounded,
near the fire-place. In a moment the
key was in the lock, in another instant
the door was flung wide open.</p>

<p>"Save yourselves!" shouted Bess,
elevating her voice to an unnatural
pitch. "The house is on fire&mdash;delay
another moment and you are lost!"</p>

<p>"Shall we move, Fitz?"</p>

<p>"I guess we'd better, Parson!"</p>

<!-- page 290 col 1 -->

<p>The words had scarcely passed his
lips when the folds of white garments
fluttered before his eyes, and two female
forms, rushing from the doorway
of the hall, bounded along the floor
with one convulsive spring like that
of the doe when environed by hunters.
Mabel, herself all terror, supported
the quivering form of Mary. In an
instant they passed the form of Bess,
as with the key in her hand, she held
the front door wide open.</p>

<p>"Now girls," she shrieked. "Cling
to my arms, and we may escape!"</p>

<p>With a fair girl clinging to each
arm, she darted from the doorway,
and was lost to view.</p>

<p>"It's the very girl&mdash;the one in the
white dress its Mabel!" exclaimed
Parson Pyne.</p>

<p>"Yes, but there were two in white
dresses&mdash;" interrupted Fitz-Cowles.</p>

<p>"The one with long dark hair, and
jet-black eyes; that was Mabel!" cried
Parson Pyne, moving toward the door.</p>

<p>"Ha! Say you so! I'd peril a cool
thousand to win her. Let's give chase.
That alarm of fire was all a sham."</p>

<p>They moved to the door, and looked
out upon the night. At a short distance
down the narrow street, the white
garments of Mary and Mabel waved
in the light of the moon.</p>

<p>"I'll pursue them!" shouted Fitz-Cowles,
darting down the street.</p>

<p>"And I'll run this way, and head
them off, at the next street!" cried
the Parson, moving briskly along the
alley in an opposite direction. "Ten
chances to one, they take the alley,
which winds round and round like a boa
constrictor, and at last strikes into the
street, about a hundred yards ahead!
Ha, ha! I can walk quietly along and

<!-- page 290 col 2 -->

head them off. Should dear little Mabel
get into my hand's again&mdash;&mdash;ah-ha!"</p>

<p>The Parson pursued his way along
the street, chuckling gaily to himself.
And at the very moment that
Fitz-Cowles pursued the wanderers in
one direction, while the Parson endeavored
to intercept them in another,
the form of Devil-Bug appeared in the
broad doorway of Monk-Hall.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" he cried, looking westwardly
down the narrow street. "There
they go, with a feller chasin' 'em!
There's Bess&mdash;curse her! There's Lorrimer's
gal, and there's Nell! Ha! They
strike into the alley, which instead of
going straight ahead like a reg'lar
Phil'delphy alley, winds round the
yard of Monk-Hall, and comes into the
street agin about a hundred yards
ahead. Ho, ho! I have it! I have it!
I'll just climb the fence of the yard, and
drop down into the alley back of Monk-Hall!
The gal's will come trampin'
down the alley for dear life&mdash;they'll
see a black lump on the ground&mdash;they'll
rush on thinkin' it a stone, but that
black lump will rise on its feet and it
will stretch out its arms and grasp 'em.
Old Devil-Bug will have the child, his
darter agin!"</p>

<p>He disappeared within the door of
Monk-Hall.</p>

<p>The moon rose above the house-tops.
Monk-Hall gleamed in the silvery
light like a goblin mansion. Each
peak of the roof, each fantastic chimney,
the massive tower and the front
of black and red brick intermingled in
strange contrast, were disclosed by the
light of the rising moon, floating so
soft and mellow from the expanse of
the fathomless winter sky.</p>

<!-- page 291 col 1 -->

<p>Meanwhile along the narrow street,
each arm supporting the form of a half-fainting
girl, Bess pursued her way,
her heart filled with one fixed purpose,
and her very soul nerved for the
effort. The sound of footsteps struck
upon her ear, She turned her head
over her shoulder, and beheld Fitz-Cowles
at the distance of some fifty
yards. His conical hat and gold-headed
cane were directly perceptible
in the moonlight. But one course remained
for Bess. She must strike into
the narrow alley or be overtaken.</p>

<p>Gathering the arms of the girls more
firmly within her own, Bess whispered
a word of encouragement in their ears
and darted around. The three forms
were lost to view in the winding alley.</p>

<p>" 'Gad! I'll have them yet!" shouted
Fitz-Cowles, gaining the corner of the
alley, and gazing intently upon the
figures of the wanderers. "That face
and those eyes are not so easily forgotten!
'Gad I'll have them yet!"</p>

<p>Bess turned her head over her
shoulder&mdash;she saw the pursuer gaining
upon her at every step.</p>

<p>"On Mary," she whispered. "On
Mabel!" for by some strange means
he had gained the name of the strange
maiden. "You are running from
death, and worse than death!"</p>

<p>Her words infused a new life into
the heart of Mabel; poor Mary, too,
felt a strange energy darting through
her veins.</p>

<p>Not a word more was said, but on
and onward they dashed. Over the
rough stones, through the puddles of
miry water, beneath the shadow of the
thickly clustered houses, on and onward&mdash;a
race for maiden purity, a
race for woman's honor!</p>

<!-- page 291 col 2 -->

<p>At every step Fitz-Cowles gained
upon the wanderers. His shout of
laughing derision burst upon their ears;
the echo of his footsteps smote their
hearts like a death-knell.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" he laughed. "My black-eyed
damsel. I'll have you, by Jove,
I'll have you yet!"</p>

<p>Bess reached a point of the winding
alley, where the thickly-clustered
houses, were superseded on one side,
by a high board fence. Over the
fence, dark indistinct and gloomy, was
seen the roof of Monk-Hall, with the
tower rising in the moon-beams.</p>

<p>As Bess reached the fence, Fitz-Cowles
was within ten paces of her
side. Nothing could save her now.
Panting for breath, the girls clung
tremblingly to her arms; their weight
began to drag her down; her strength
gave tokens of exhaustion.</p>

<p>Fitz-Cowles uttered a shout of triumph
and sprang forward to grasp his
victim. He did not heed the dark
lump which like a blackened rock,
uprose from the very centre of the
pathway. The girls rushed past the
blackened mass. Fitz-Cowles sprang
forward to grasp them, laughing gaily
in the action, when a wild yell broke
on the air, mingling with his cheerful
laugh, the black mass at his feet assumed
the shape and form of the monster,
and Devil-Bug confronted the
Millionaire.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, my teller. I've got yo'
have I?" he shrieked with a blazing
eye. "What in the devil d'ye mean
by chasin' that gal?"</p>

<p>"Stand back or I'll cleave your
skull with my cane! Stand back fellow&mdash;you're
in my pay, and I'll chastise
you for this insolence!"</p>

<!-- page 292 col 1 -->

<p>And Fitz-Cowles brandished his
gold-headed cane in the light of the
moon. "You'll chastise me, will ye?"
shouted Devil-Bug. "There never
yet was a man as felt the weight o'
this arm and lived afterwards!"</p>

<p>He sprang upon Fitz-Cowles with a
yell. They clenched together, they
fell in the mire of the gutter, and
fought like dogs, the Savage and the
Millionaire!</p>

<p>Onward with faint and weary steps,
the wanderers held their way. They
reached the termination of the winding
alley, where it emerged upon the narrow
street, a hundred yards distant
from Monk-Hall. Panting for breath
and trembling in every tired limb Mabel
clung nervously to the arm of Bess,
while Mary, her senses whirling in
strange, confusion flung the weight
of her quivering form full upon the
shoulder of the dark-eyed woman.</p>

<p>"Ha! There is a man standing at
the corner of the street&mdash;we are watched!"
Bess exclaimed in a whisper.
"Courage, Mabel, courage Mary, you
shall not be dragged to Monk-Hall
again while Bess has a firm soul or a
resolute arm!"</p>

<p>"It is my father!" whispered Mabel,
trembling in every limb.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my pretty Mabel! It <i>is</i>
your father!" cried the portly Parson,
advancing from the shadows of the
street. "Come here with me, and I'll
overlook your recent misconduct; come
home my dear!"</p>

<p>He approached the trembling girl.
She clung to the arm of Bess with the
energy of despair. Bess suddenly
flung the maiden aside, and raised her
arm on high. Each sinew was braced
for a desperate effort, and the tiny fingers

<!-- page 292 col 2 -->

of her hand grasped the massive
key of Monk-Hall.</p>

<p>"Oh do not cast me from you,"
shrieked Mabel.</p>

<p>"Come to your pa-pa, my dear,"
exclaimed Parson Pyne, reaching forth
his hand to grasp the form of Mabel.</p>

<p>Her eyes flashing fire, Bess sprang
forward, and struck the Parson on the
forehead with the massive iron key.
The blow was as sudden as it was unexpected:
he reeled to one side and
fell upon the pavement like a dead
man.</p>

<p>"Now, girls, cling to my arms yet
once again. Ere an hour passes over
my head, I will place you in a quiet
refuge, where no wrong can assail
you, no dark passion mar your
peace!"</p>

<p>"Anywhere Bessie, to the lowest
hovel, to the abode of rags and misery
and want, but for God's sake not to that
home&mdash;the home which I left only last
night for the mansion of Lorraine. I
have had my dream, Bessie&mdash;God
alone knows how terrible has been the
awakening from that dream!"</p>

<p>As Mary spoke, her voice grew
tremulous and Bess turned her face
away from the gaze of the ruined girl.
That wan countenance, those eyes of
liquid blue dilating with a frenzied
glare&mdash;the vision blasted the very
eyesight of Long-haired Bess.</p>

<p>Mabel clung to the arm of the tall
woman, and in a whisper besought her
to fly from the spot.</p>

<p>"Let us away," she cried. "My
father&mdash;" and she pointed to the portly
form which cumbered the roadside.
"I fear him worse than the grave."</p>

<p>Bess silently gathered the arms of
each girl within her own, and then as

<!-- page 293 col 1 -->

the moon shone upon the wan yet
beaming face with blue eyes and
golden hair, on one side, and the pale
countenance with dark eyes and midnight
tresses, on the other, she raised
her gaze to the moonlit heavens above,
and for the moment her dark orbs
grew lustrous with a strange eloquence.</p>

<p>At that moment, as standing at the
corner of the gloomy street, with a
ruined girl on one side a wronged
maiden on the other, her face, once so
beautiful, and now lovely to look upon
in its very ruins, was imbued with an
expression holy as that which mantles
over the face of the dying mother
when blessing her first born child.</p>

<p>Up to the throne of the pure and
merciful God, from the heart of the
Courtezan there ascended a vow, a
holy vow! She was degraded, steeped
to the very lips in pollution, cankered
to the heart with loathsome vice,
yet at that moment, she was a holy
thing in the sight of the angels, for
before the altar of Almighty God, she
swore to protect the ruined Mary to
the death, she vowed to guard the
stainless Mabel from the shadow of a
wrong. And the vow went up to God,
and the moon, rising higher over the
roof-tops, seemed to shed a more
kindly light as if to crown that vow
with an omen of success.</p>

<p>And the Three Sisters, the Fallen,
Betrayed and the Innocent, wandered
forth, along the streets, on their
gloomy way.</p>

<p><i>One</i>, from the old State House
clock, <i>one</i>. There is a wild music in
the sound of that old bell. It rings
like the voice of a warning spirit,
when heard in the silence of night.

<!-- page 293 col 2 -->

How many have heard it in the dead
hour of night, ere they laid down to
die? The suicide, wan faced and heart
broken, has paused on the edge of the
Delaware, as the sound of that bell
has for a moment, called him back
to life. The poor mechanic, starving
in his desolate home, has raised his
head for the last time, as the old bell
struck one upon his freezing ear, and
then moaned and clutched the air and
died. The Bank Director revelling
at the sight of his gold, won from the
poor by fraud to which a pirate's
crimes are acts of benevolence; the
jolly Bank Director counting over his
sweat-wrung gold at the solemn hour
of the night, has been aroused from
his reveries by that awful sound, dim,
booming and knell-like&mdash;the State
House clock tolling ONE. Woman,
fair, and young, and beautiful, sinking
into the arms of shame, has started
from the polluted couch as that sound
broke on her ears, now fast-sealed to
all the warnings of conscience. She
has started, and thought of the voice
of her grey-haired father, she has
started and wept!</p>

<p>ONE!</p>

<p>The young author, with his sallow
cheeks, lighted by the glare of a
dickering lamp, and his threadbare
coat, fluttering in rags on his wasted
form; the young author sitting at his
desk at the lone hour of night, while
he wrestles with all the world for
fame and fortune, his only weapon a
rusted pen, hears that State House
bell&mdash;God bless it for its memories!&mdash;striking
the hour of ONE, and rising
from his task he beholds his success
painted on the very darkness which
beclouds his path. Already he beholds

<!-- page 294 col 1 -->

the world at his feet, already
the bloodhounds of calumniation and
persecution, lie gasping in their last
agonies, while his foot is on their
necks. Huzza for the old State House
bell, and above all other hours, huzza
for the hour of ONE.</p>

<p>ONE!</p>

<p>The minister of justice, bending
over the table, on whose surface the
hard gold is flung ringing down by
the hands of the wealthy citizen who
sits smiling opposite; the hard gold
which buys the life of some wealthy
murderer from the gallows, or the
liberty of some gilded robber from the
jail, this honest minister of justice,
starts and trembles as he hears the
State House bell strike ONE!</p>

<p>That dull and booming sound seems
to call into life the vengeance of the
People, which shall one day hurl the
lordly minister of the law from his
proud position; already he beholds
written on the walls of his chamber,
in letters of flame, that black and
staring word&mdash;"CORRUPTION."</p>

<p>Huzza for the hour of ONE.</p>

<p>That sound, speaking from the
heights of Independence Hall, strikes
ever the Quaker City like the voice
of God's Judgment, rousing crime
from its task, mirth from its wine-cup,
murder from its knife, bribery from
its gold.</p>

<p>Huzza for the old State House bell,
and above all other hours huzza for
the hour of one.</p>

<p>Two figures were slowly wending
their way along a well-known street
in the District of Southwark.</p>

<p>"Curse the huzzy. Just look at

<!-- page 294 col 2 -->

my forehead! The marks o' that
key will disfigure me for life."</p>

<p>"It doesn't improve your forehead
much&mdash;that's a fact, Parson. But you
should have seen the keelhauling that
monster gave me! Egad, there isn't
a bone in my body that doesn't ache!"</p>

<p>"How did you get off from old
Devil-Bug? Eh, Fitz?"</p>

<p>"Palavered the old scoundrel.
Made believe that I was a-going to
protect the girl and all that. Deuced
singular he should take such an interest
in her&mdash;ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Quite unaccountable, as we say
in the pulpit, when the morning collection
is rather small. However,
Fitz, I've sold the girl to you for one
hundred dollars, and you shall have
her."</p>

<p>"When, for instance?"</p>

<p>"By to-morrow at noon!"</p>

<p>"Say you so, my Parson! Place
this girl in my possession by to-morrow
noon, and another hundred shall
be yours!"</p>

<p>"Give me your hand on that Fitz.
There my boy it shall be done! Now
Mabel my pretty chit"&mdash;he muttered
to himself while his rubicund face was
purple with hate; "we'll see who
places the character of the reverend
Pastor of a loving flock in jeopardy:
we'll see who gets old monsters to
defend them&mdash;&mdash;the huzzy!"</p>

<p>"What a comfort it is," soliloquized
Fitz-Cowles, "what a comfort it is
to think, that the hundred dollar note
which I gave the Parson was on a
Sand Bank."</p>

<p>"Ha! Fitz. Look yonder&mdash;there
they go&mdash;the three beauties. Let's
give chase!"</p>

<!-- page 295 col 1 -->

<p>"Agreed! Now for another race&mdash;a
moment and we'll have them!"</p>

<p>In the distance, at the corner of the
next street, the white garments of Mabel
and Mary, with the dark robes of
Bess fluttering between the two young
forms, waved for a moment in the
moonlight. In another moment the
portly Pyne and the well-formed millionaire
gave chase; in a moment the
three women turned the corner of the
next street. It required but a few
seconds for Pyne and Fitz-Cowles to
gain the corner of the street. They
looked up and down the street&mdash;the
women had disappeared. The moon
was shining brightly in the heavens,
and its beams illumined the long street,
which like all Philadelphia streets was
laid out with all the matter-of-fact
straightness of a ten-pin alley.</p>

<p>"Where could they have disappeared!"
muttered Pyne, "there is no
alley between this street and the next,
and I see no signs of any other hiding
place. They must have gone into
some o' these houses."</p>

<p>"Egad! where will you find a house
open at this hour? They must have
sunk down plump into the bricks of
the pavement."</p>

<p>"Ha! Here is the widow Smolby's
house. Ten to one they went in this
door&mdash;wait a moment, I'll knock."</p>

<p>Accordingly, the Reverend Doctor
Pyne knocked at the door of the widow
Smolby's ancient mansion. In a few
moments the door receded about the
width of an inch, and the glare of a
light flashed out upon the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"Is the widow Smolby in?" asked
the pious Dr. Pyne, assuming his blandest
tone.</p>

<p>"Not e'zactly, but her corpse is, if

<!-- page 295 col 2 -->

that 'll answer"&mdash;answered a rough
voice from the crevice of the door.</p>

<p>"Her corpse?"</p>

<p>"I s'pose you don't know that the
widder was took bad with an attack of
murder and thieves this arternoon?
The crowner sot upon her, which considerin'
as he's a wery fat man, was
rayther an ungenteel thing for him to
do."</p>

<p>"You did not see anything of three
young ladies in these parts, did you?"
asked the zealous Dr. Pyne, in his
most unctuous voice.</p>

<p>"Now wot a precious question that
is, to wake a man up in the middle o'
th' night for! Make a pin-cushion of
me somebody, and hang me up agin
the wall for all the old ladies to stick
pins in, but if I ain't got a notion to
come out there old porpis'!"</p>

<p>With these words, the gentleman on
the inside, being in somewhat of an
angry mood, violently closed the door,
using a familiar synonym for condemnation
with some considerable emphasis.</p>

<p>"How much his voice sounds like
that of Major Mulhill!" muttered Fitz-Cowles.</p>

<p>"The gal is in this house; I've not
a doubt of it!" blandly remarked the
Foe of Pagan Rome.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is Monk Baltzar,
I feel interested in this girl. Her dark
eyes have made a decided impression
on me. I never yet fancied a woman
that I did not win, and so if you'll by
some means or other, I don't care how,
secure this girl for me by to-morrow
at noon, another hundred shall be
yours!"</p>

<p>"I'll manage it; trust me with the
affair Fitz. You must know I've some

<!-- page 296 col 1 -->

small spite against this girl, and by to-morrow
at noon this petticoat shall be
in your power. By-the-bye, what's
that object in the gutter yonder?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but a drunken man.
Come Parson, let's stroll down the
street, and arrange matters."</p>

<p>And as they strolled down the street
talking earnestly together, the dark
object in the gutter moved to and fro,
and in a moment it resolved itself into
the outlines of a man's figure. The
Moon shone over a wan and ghastly
face with glassy eyes, glaring fixedly
on the blue heavens above. Around
that face fell thick locks of jet black
hair, all matted with the mire of the
gutter and soiled with the dust of the
street. And the man crawled slowly
along the hard stones of the street, and
then as if unable to move from weakness,
he raised his face faintly in the
light of the moon and looked upon the
heavens and uttered a low cry. Then
his head dropped upon the stones of
the street, and he lay like a dead man.</p>

<p>The heart of Bess thrilled with despair
when, after all her wanderings,
all her efforts to escape from Monk-Hall,
she heard the triumphant cry
of the Parson and the Millionaire, as
they again pursued her.</p>

<p>Dragging the exhausted girls with
her, she rushed forward, but the
strength of the three soon failed, and
she was about to sink down with despair
when Mabel uttered an exclamation
of surprise.</p>

<p>"This is the widow Smolby's house
from which my father dragged me
twelve hours ago!" exclaimed Mabel,
as she beheld the gloomy walls of the
old house rising in the moonbeams.</p>

<!-- page 296 col 2 -->

<p>"The widow Smolby!" muttered
Bess, as though some strange memory
had flashed over her brain. "Ha!
We may obtain shelter here&mdash;I'll
make the attempt at all events!"</p>

<p>She knocked at the door. It receded
slightly, and a rough voice from
within demanded her errand.</p>

<p>"Ha! Larkspur!" she exclaimed,
"Is that you? Long-haired Bess
asks you to give her shelter for the
night&mdash;she has some important facts
to disclose with regard to the late
murder."</p>

<p>"Why, Bess, my duck, is that
you?" cried Easy Larkspur, opening
the door. "Two young ladies with
you&mdash;oh, ho! Up to some new caper,
I s'pose! Come in, my dear!"</p>

<p>For the first time a wild suspicion
darted over the brain of Mary Arlington,
that Bess was a courtezan, that
she had been betrayed through her
means. That thought, so wild and
vague and yet so terrible, smote poor
Mary to the soul. The familiar manner
with which a rough looking gentleman
like Easy Larkspur, greeted
Bessie, first aroused this suspicion in
the mind of Mary.</p>

<p>"Walk in ladies: walk in! You
see I was jist enjoyin' a glass of
whiskey punch by the fire, with a
prime Hawanner! And whiskey
punch, ladies, as you may have had
occasion to know, is a werry good
drink, an' goes down quite e-a-sy!
Ladies, I'd always adwise yo' to marry
a gentleman, as knows how to make
good whiskey punch, but you must be
keerful he don't make it too weak.
Weak punch&mdash;" continued the red-faced
gentleman, with an anti-total-abstinence
smile&mdash;"Weak punch, in my

<!-- page 297 col 1 -->

opinion, is the most despisable thing
as is!"</p>

<p>"Larkspur, I have one word to say
to you. From an accomplice of the
murderer I have gained some knowledge
of the murder committed in this
house yesterday afternoon. This
knowledge I will place in your keeping
on one consideration. Give these
ladies and myself shelter for the
night; this is all I ask of you."</p>

<p>"Why you see, Bessie, I was app'inted,
after the crowner's inquest had
sot upon the old lady, to stay here all
night, in case the thieves might take a
notion to repeat their wisit. My fellers
is a-sleepin' in the back room.
You wouldn't like to try a leetle of
this punch, would yo'? You may
stay here all night; no doubt o' that!
But as all the other rooms was locked
up by the Ma'or, you'll have to sleep
in the room where the corpse is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, heaven!" whispered Mabel&mdash;"Is
the old lady dead?" And her
dark eyes grew lustrous with fear and
awe.</p>

<p>"Dead, my darlin', as the 'Nited
States Bank!" observed Larkspur,
with whiskey punch beaming from
every line of his face. "And a deader
thing than that I don't know; it's
about the deadest thing as is; that's a
fact!"</p>

<p>Bess silently led the girls up stairs.
The same shudder thrilled through
every heart as they entered the Ghost-Chamber.
Two formal wax candles
gave a dim light to the place. The
massive bed, with its thick curtains,
still stood in one corner, the high-backed chairs
had been replaced in
their positions against the wall; the
mirror between the windows still

<!-- page 297 col 2 -->

flashed back the light of the candles.
The room was the same as in the
morning; the furniture still wore the
same antique and ghostly air; and the
portrait above the mantel, still gazed
around the place with its pale and
beautiful countenance relieved by
sweeping tresses of long black hair
and enlivened by the gleam of lustrous
dark eyes.</p>

<p>The Ghost-Room was the same,
and yet not altogether the same.
There was a crust of hardened blood
congealed along the cold bricks of the
fire-place; the very air seemed tainted
with the smell of human blood, shed
in violence and murder.</p>

<p>In the centre of the chamber, in the
full glare of the light, rested a coffin
covered with a plain cloth, and placed
upon tressels of sable wood. The
glare of the light flashed over the details
of the cold white shroud, the stiff
hands carefully crossed over each
other, the feet thrusting the death robe
slightly upward, all were painfully
disclosed, but the face was covered
with a loose piece of snowy linen.
Mangled, and shattered, and crushed,
it was too fearful a sight for the eyes
of the living to behold, and yet was it
not tenfold more horrible to see that
white cloth thrown over the face, leaving
the vivid fancy to depict the loathsome
reality, than to look upon the
palpable reality itself? To fancy the
cold blood falling drop by drop upon
the bottom of the coffin, from the hollow
skull!</p>

<p>There she lay, her gold forgotten,
her blood cold and icy, her limbs
stiffened as marble. And as the light
flickered with an uncertain glare, and
as the wind moaned through the

<!-- page 298 col 1 -->

crevices of the chamber, and as the
hangings of the bed and the windows
rustled heavily to and fro, while from
the frame of the portrait, the face of
a beautiful woman gazed sadly upon
the scene, it seemed as though an
awful and invisible fiend had infected
the very air with a curse. That fiend
was Murder; in the rustling curtains,
in the moaning wind, in the flickering
light, in the sad gaze of the portrait,
in the spectacle of the coffin and the
corse; in all these he spoke with a
voice that froze the blood in its career,
and stilled the heart in its beatings.</p>

<p>"Behold your mother!" cried Bess,
in a tone of wild agitation, as seizing
Mabel by the hand she pointed to the
portrait. "Behold your mother! You
are the child of Livingstone the merchant;
this house and all its contents
are yours! Yours by the will of yon
murdered woman, who rests cold and
icy in her coffin. Behold the face of
your mother, gazing upon you in
kindness and love. Kneel, Mabel,
kneel, and thank your God that after
the long night which has darkened
your life, the day has dawned at
last!"</p>

<p>And while Mabel stood stricken
dumb with astonishment, while her
brain whirled in wild confusion, and
the very room seemed to reel around
her, Bess turned aside and took Mary
by the hand.</p>

<p>"Now hear the dark confession
which I have to whisper to your ear,"
she shrieked, falling on her knees.
"I was the cause of your ruin; I was
the accomplice of the seducer; I took
his wages; and earned them by selling
myself, body and soul into his hands!
I, it was, that lured you from your

<!-- page 298 col 2 -->

home, I, it was, that led you on to ruin&mdash;my
soul is blackened by the full
guilt of a crime than which hell can
name no deed of darker horror.</p>

<p>"Hear this confession and hear my
fixed resolve! Spurn me from you,
trample on me, curse me, oh curse
me, but from your side living I will
never depart! You do not wish to return
to your father's house. I will
slave for you, work for you, beg for
you! Let me wash out some portion
of my crime by a life-long devotion to
your service. Curse me, Mary, spit
upon me, Mary, spurn me as the base
thing I am, should be spurned, but I
am your slave through life&mdash;my crime
shall be washed out in tears of blood!"</p>

<p>Vain were the power of language
to paint the horror which paled the
face of Mary Arlington as this dark
confession fell shrieking on her ear.
She looked vacantly in the face of the
kneeling woman, she even toyed playfully
with her long dark hair, and
then she gave utterance to a wild and
maniac laugh.</p>

<p>"Lorraine," she cried, "Lorraine,
ha, ha, ha! He will return at last,
he will yet be mine! Lorraine! Lorraine!"</p>

<p>CHAPTER THIRTEENTH.</p>

<p class="small">THE GOLD WHICH DEVIL-BUG WON.</p>

</div>

<p>SLOWLY and silently Devil-Bug ascended
the staircase of Monk-Hall,
The lamp which he held extended at
arm's length cast a flaring light over
his distorted face, now rendered ten-fold
more hideous by the tokens of

<!-- page 299 col 1 -->

some terrible emotion. He had bitten
his upper lip until the blood trickled
over his clenched teeth, down to his
pointed chin. There was a glassy
light in his solitary eye, and a lowering
frown, full of omen, upon his protuberant
brow.</p>

<p>Slowly and silently, with the light
in his hand, he ascended the massive
staircase of Monk-Hall. He uttered
no word, but fearful thoughts were
working at his heart. One hour ago,
his heart had been softened into something
like human feeling&mdash;a very child
might have led the savage, and ruled
him with a word. That word, a word
of kindness to the child of Ellen. <i>Now</i>&mdash;they
had stolen the child, they had
torn the fair girl from his arms, and
Devil-Bug was a savage once more.
Like a black cloud arising from the
stagnant waves of the Dead Sea, so the
feeling of fierce malignity to all the
human race, arose hideous and terrible
from the depths of the monster's soul.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he cried, as he suddenly
paused upon the stairway. "The
corpse o' that man Harvey, is a-layin'
beside the grave in the Pit o' Monk-Hall!
I must go down and bury it.
Yes, yes, snug under the airth, snug,
snug I'll put it out o' sight."</p>

<p>He turned round and began to descend
the stairway.</p>

<p>"I'll bury it&mdash;that I will! And as
the hard clods fall on his white face,
I'll laff&mdash;ho, ho, ho! I'll laff when I
think o' the prize that's in store for
me&mdash;the tall woman with the rale ripe
lips, and jet-black eyes!"</p>

<p>He raised his left hand into the
glare of the lamp, and then a fiendish
laugh convulsed his brawny chest.</p>

<p>"Nobody don't see that ring on my

<!-- page 299 col 2 -->

little finger, do they? It's most too
small for the finger, so I had to
squeeze it on above the j'int. Does
anybody see it? I wonders if the dead
man 'ill see it, when I holds it to his
glassy eye, and tells him about the
prize it won for me!"</p>

<p>Again that low-toned yet horrible
laugh echoed along the stairway, and
Devil-Bug flung the lamp wildly on
high, in the excess of his infernal glee.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I'll force his cold eye
lids slowly apart, I'll rub the ring
against the frozen eyeballs and I'll
shout in his ear, 'Luke, my boy, you
was a jolly feller when alive, and now
when you're dead a ring from your
finger buys <i>sich</i> a prize for Devil-Bug,
<i>sich</i> a rale screamer of a prize! First
I'll bury the corpse&mdash;and then, ho, ho,
ho, I'll taste the red lips o' that sweet
young woman as is a-dyin' to see me
up stairs!"</p>

<p>Laughing horribly to himself, he
descended into the vault of Monk-Hall.
There was a long pause of silence,
and the light of the moon, streaming
from the skylight in the roof, faintly
illumined the winding stairway. Nearly
half an hour passed, and the night
began to wane towards its close, when
the beams of a lamp again flashed
over the stairway, and Devil-Bug
came hastening upward, with a strange
and peculiar expression impressing the
lines of his distorted visage.</p>

<p>With immense strides he hurried
up the stairway, flinging the hand
which grasped the light merrily from
side to side, while that hideous sound,
like the laugh of a devil, echoed from
the depths of his chest.</p>

<p>"It rather puzzled me," he muttered,
and then chuckled gaily to himself&mdash;"Quite

<!-- page 300 col 1 -->

a riddle&mdash;a werry good
riddle to be sure!" His features
gleamed with an expression of infernal
triumph. "Ho, ho, ho! I see
how it was done, I see it all! The
feller come to himself, and tried to
crawl from the cellar, and not knowin'
whar' he wos, he fell into the water,
and wos carried off jist like a dead rat,
or a cat, or any other crittur! I should
'ave like to have heered him howl
when he found himself floatin' into
the underground channel&mdash;ho, ho,
ho!"</p>

<p>In his glee he raised his left hand
to his forehead and swept the thick
hair aside from his eye. The ring on
his finger glittered in the light.</p>

<p>"The sweet young lady with the
red lips and the dark eyes&mdash;ha, ha!
I don't think I ought to keep her
waitin' any longer. The ring is on
my finger, and the prize is mine! The
han'some woman is bought and sold&mdash;ho,
ho, ho!"</p>

<p>Hurrying up the stairway, Devil-Bug
presently attained the hall on the
second floor. In a moment he stood
in front of the chamber, where Livingstone,
the night before, had witnessed
the guilt of his wife.</p>

<p>Raising the light overhead, he applied
his ear to the keyhole of the
door and listened with speechless intensity
for a single instant.</p>

<p>That ghastly grimace, that flashing
eye, that upraised hand with the ring
glistening in the light&mdash;oh Dora,
proud and fearless Dora, better death
than the foul dishonor, which glares
upon you from the monster's face!</p>

<p>The lofty chamber was full of
shadows. The shadow of the lofty

<!-- page 300 col 2 -->

bed, the shadows of the high-backed
chairs, the shadow of the antique
dressing bureau, all thrown along the
floor, by the trembling light which
stood upon the small table in the
centre of the gorgeous carpet. Then
the fire on the wide hearth, ever and
anon, would light up in a ruddy glare,
flinging along the carpet, the shadow
of a young and beautiful form, seated
by the table of ebony. Then the curtains
of the bed would rustle into the
light, presenting the soft azure of their
folds to the glare of the fire or the
mild beams of the lamp, or the oval
mirror would reflect both shadows
and light with a gloomy and spectral
effect, or the uncouth figures, delineated
in warm colors on the rich
carpet, would assume a temporary life
as they basked in the glow that flashed
from the fireside.</p>

<p>The chamber was full of sombre
shadows and full of glaring flashes of
light. Now the golden coronet, surmounting
the canopy of the bed, glittered
in the light, and the rich silken
folds of purple and azure which lined
the lofty walls of the chamber, were
tinted with a lively glow, and again
the painting above the mantel, where
Venus in all her softness and beauty
lay uncovered amid the rosy freshness
of the rising morn, felt the gentle influence
of a sudden flash from the
hearth, or warmed into life, beneath
the beams of the trembling lamp.</p>

<p>Still amid thick shadows and glaring
gleams of light, along the floor was
flung the shadow of a young and
beautiful form.</p>

<p>Dora Livingstone sat beside the table,
her cheek resting on her hand,
while the glossy tresses of her dark

<!-- page 301 col 1 -->

hair fell clustering to her shoulders.
The lovely outlines of her form were
still disclosed in the close-fitting frock
coat which became her so well. The
collar of the coat was thrown back
and the shirt flung open at the throat,
disclosed the whiteness of her snowy
neck, with a glimpse of her bosom,
now heaving and throbbing with tumultuous
thoughts.</p>

<p>She was very beautiful, was that
proud and scheming woman in her
male disguise. The light fell warmly
over her wide shoulders, so voluptuous
in their outline, over the rounded
fullness of her bust, over the slender
gracefulness of the waist, as the close-fitting
frock coat gathered round her
form with the nicety of a glove.</p>

<p>She was very beautiful, and yet
along each cheek of her queenly countenance
there flashed a spot of vivid
and burning red, which betokened the
feverish anxiety which absorbed the
soul of the proud woman, while her
dark eyes, flashing with a clear and
brilliant glance, fraught with unutterable
meaning, glared upon the thick
shadows of the chamber with a fixed
and immoveable gaze. Her brow was
calm and unfrowning as that of the
sleeping babe, and the emotion which
absorbed her soul was manifested in
the agitation of her bosom, as it swelled
into the light, in the compression
of her red ripe lips, in the feverish
spot of burning red upon each blooming
cheek.</p>

<p>Thus had she sat for hours more
like a criminal waiting for the morn
which was to bring her fair neck to
the doomsman's axe, than the determined
Murderess waiting for her victim.</p>

<p>And now, as the silence of the

<!-- page 301 col 2 -->

chamber gradually awed her soul, as
the flashing gleams of light, struggling
with the thick masses of shadow, imparted
a spectral effect to the chamber
and its costly furniture, the
thoughts of the proud woman, sitting
there so silently in that unwomanly
disguise, dwelt on the Past and its
memories.</p>

<p>First, like some pale and reproachful
ghost sent from the grave to warn
her of her guilt, arose the thought of
the days when she was a pure-hearted
and innocent girl.</p>

<p>The hand which supported her
cheek trembled, and her lips grew
ashy white. The face of her mother
was before her, that face with its outlines
broken by grief, and the large
black eyes, dilated to an unnatural
size by sickness and pain, arose before
her for a moment in appalling distinctness.</p>

<p>Starting with involuntary terror,
Dora's gaze was fixed upon the gorgeous
bed. At the sight of that
canopy with its luxuriant folds and its
coronet of stars, all the blackness of
her crime rushed upon the dishonored
wife. There, upon that couch of
shame, had she lain down the purity
of a wife, to take up the dishonor of an
adultress!</p>

<p>Dora turned her eyes away from
the bed, and tried to drown the silent
voices speaking forever within her, by
the thought of the prize for which she
had trafficked her soul. Glowing
visions of pomp and power, the coronet
on her brow, and the title to her name,
the smile of a Queen beaming upon
her face, and the glories of ancestral
rank flashing all around her; glowing
visions in which her grasping ambition

<!-- page 302 col 1 -->

was crowned with triumph, dawned
upon her soul.</p>

<p>And yet, whether it was from the
feverish anxiety of her long and terrible
watch, or whether the future already
gleamed upon her soul, mingling
its revelations with the remembrances
of memory, whenever she thought of the
coronet which was soon to entwine her
brow, it became all loathsome with
crawling grave-worms, the Queen
who smiled upon her, became a grinning
skeleton, and all the lordly flatterers
whom she had fancied kneeling
at her feet, suddenly arose with the
ghastliness of death painted on their
faces, while around their icy limbs the
death-shroud waved in drooping folds.</p>

<p>Dora covered her face with her
hands. By one sudden effort she
banished these thoughts. The echo
of a footstep struck upon her ear.</p>

<p>She started, she turned pale, she
arose to her feet.</p>

<p>"It is <i>he!</i>" she muttered with ashy
lips, while her hands were clasped
over her bosom. "It is the Murderer!"</p>

<p>She listened eagerly for the footstep.
It approached the door of her
chamber&mdash;it passed&mdash;it was but the
footstep of a reveller from the Banquet
Room. Dora resumed her seat and
breathed freely again.</p>

<p>Then, leaning her cheek on her
hand, she endeavored to banish all
thought from her soul, while her ear
drank in the slightest echo of a sound.</p>

<p>Worn out by feverish suspense, she
fell into a brief and half-wakeful slumber,
in which her soul was startled by
terrible dreams. The faces of the dead
were before her sealed eyes, grinning
hideously in her face as if in derision

<!-- page 302 col 2 -->

of all her ambitious plans, and then a
coffin, black as midnight, was borne
slowly past, by hands outstretched
from a lowering cloud. Then the
death-stricken countenance of Luke
Harvey arose from the coffin-lid and
smiled upon her in scorn, while his
hands tore the shroud from his limbs,
and scattered the fragments in her
very face. Dora started from her
brief and feverish slumber, and gazed
around the lonely chamber. The bed
with its costly hangings arrested her
eye.</p>

<p>"Ha!" she exclaimed, in a low
whisper, as though her blood was
chilled by the fear that one loud tone
of her voice might arouse the dead
into life, from the thick shadows of the
room. "My soul is terrified by
strange fears, yet I will endure it all!
Skeletons have arisen and gibbered in
my face, the dead long-forgotten have
been with me, and a coffin has been
borne before me, by hands outstretched
from a lowering cloud&mdash;yet will I
endure it all! Ha, ha!" her deep-toned
whisper was succeeded by a
wild and startling laugh. "Such a
ridiculous fancy! It is quite laughable.
I just now imagined that my
husband might have been looking
through the bed-curtains last night,
while I slumbered, unconscious of his
gaze&mdash;how very amusing!"</p>

<p>She laughed gaily, and her face
brightened with an expression of careless
glee.</p>

<p>The sound of a heavy footstep resounded
in the hall without.</p>

<p>Dora stood as if frozen to the floor.
The laugh died in her throat.</p>

<p>" 'Tis <i>he!</i>" she murmured, in a
hollow whisper.</p>

<!-- page 303 col 1 -->

<p>And in a moment Devil-Bug stood
before her, flinging the light aloft with
his extended arm, while his features
were agitated with a grin of triumph.</p>

<p>"Is <i>it</i> done," murmured Dora, in a
whisper.</p>

<p>"Lady, behold the ring!" exclaimed
Devil-Bug, slowly approaching the
proud woman, with the ring flashing
in the light. "It is done, good
lady. I've got the ring; now for the
goold!"</p>

<p>"He is dead!" exclaimed Dora,
and a wild light flashed from her dark
eyes. "I have triumphed!" She
clasped her hands together with a
convulsive gesture, and for a moment
stood motionless as a statue.</p>

<p>"Yes, lady, he's stone dead, and
the rats&mdash;jolly fellers&mdash;have already
begin to crawl over his carcase."
Devil-Bug advanced a step nearer the
proud dame, and glared upon her with
his solitary eye.</p>

<p>"I have triumphed! Rank and
power are mine. Not an enemy in
my path, nor a shadow on my future!
I shall walk among the titled dames
of the royal court, I shall feel a coronet
pressing on my brow. To-morrow
Livingstone and I depart for
Hawkewood. From Hawkewood Livingstone
never returns alive! In a
month&mdash;ay, in one short month&mdash;"
and her form rose towering to its full
height, while her eye flashed and
brightened with all the glory of the
vision that burst upon her soul&mdash;"In
one short month, Dora Livingstone,
the Cobbler's grand-daughter shall be
the Lady Dora Dalveney, of Lyndeswold."</p>

<p>"But the <i>goo</i>ld, good lady&mdash;the
<i>goo</i>ld."</p>

<!-- page 303 col 2 -->

<p>The proud woman started at the
sound of that harsh voice, she started
and beheld the eye of Devil-Bug glaring
upon her lovely face with a look
of terrible meaning. His huge hands
were crossed upon his breast, and with
his head drooped low, he stood regarding
her with a fixed gaze. That gaze
spoke volumes! Better for the fair
bosom of Dora to have been torn by
the talons of an enraged tiger, than to
have had the beauty of her proud
countenance devoured by the animal
fire of that steady look!</p>

<p>She started with involuntary surprise,
she receded a single step, and
then with a faint and trembling voice
she addressed the savage.</p>

<p>"The ring," she whispered, averting
her face as she reached forth her
hand.</p>

<p>"Here it is, good lady!" And the
solitary eye of Devil-Bug flashed with
a glance of gloating admiration, as he
extended the ring.</p>

<p>Dora looked steadily at the ring for
a single moment.</p>

<p>"It was my mother's ring!" she
whispered, in husky tones. "I gave
it&mdash;" her voice trembled&mdash;"I gave it
to him on the night when I consented
to become his wife, as a pledge of my
love."</p>

<p>These words fell trembling from
her lips, and then like a flash of
lightning, all her dreams of ambition
passed away, and a terrible memory
agitated her soul.</p>

<p>"I gave it to him while his eyes
were fixed upon mine, and my hand
trembled in his&mdash;I gave it to him,
while his kiss was yet fresh upon my
lips! And now&mdash;Great God! now I
have murdered him!</p>

<!-- page 304 col 1 -->

<p>No words can depict the utter agony
of look and emphasis which accompanied
these words. Her proud form,
rising in all its queenly stature, quivered
from head to foot, as she held the
ring extended in one hand while the
other shaded her eyes from the light.</p>

<p>"The goold, good lady, the <i>goold!</i>"</p>

<p>Devil-Bug suddenly advanced, and
grasping her extended arm with his
talon fingers, impressed a loathsome
kiss upon the fair white hand, which
held the glittering ring.</p>

<p>She started with a look of silent disgust;
she endeavored to fling the
savage from her, but his talon fingers
gathered more closely around her arm.
His grasp was like the embrace of a
vice.</p>

<p>"Yo' made the bargain good lady!
Yo' sold yourself&mdash;black eyes, poutin'
lips and all, for the ring. D'ye think
I'm sich a fool as to be cheated out of
my wages in this here way! Don't
think sich a thing good lady! Old
Devil-Bug wants the goold you promised!"</p>

<p>"Release me&mdash;" whispered Dora,
with an ashen face, as she felt the
grasp of his fingers on her arm&mdash;"Let
me pass from this room and from this
house, and I will reward you with gold
beyond all your expectations&mdash;I will
make you rich for life."</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, ho!" chuckled Devil-Bug.
"Here's a tall woman afore me, with
a look like a queen, a lip like a cherry,
a cheek like a peach, and eyes like
di'monds in a jew'ler's winder! She
axes me to give up all this,&mdash;" he
pointed to her voluptuous form&mdash;"she
axes me to give up all this for goold!
Redikulus!"</p>

<p>Dora's countenance suddenly grew

<!-- page 304 col 2 -->

lovely with all the hues of the summer
dawn. Her eye dilated and sparkled
with a clear and burning light. Casting
her glance over Devil-Bug's shoulder,
she beheld her cloak flung over
the rounds of a chair. On a table, be
sides this chair, lay the pair of loaded
pistols which she had brought with her
to Monk-Hall.</p>

<p>"Could I but obtain them," the
thought crossed her soul, like a ray of
hope; "I would defy the monster to
his teeth."</p>

<p>"Lady, there's a werry purty bloom
on yer check, and there's a werry rich
look in your eyes." He paused and
raised her fair white hand to his loathsome
lips. Then reaching forth his
other arm, with his blazing eye devouring
the loveliness of her face, he endeavored
to encircle her form with his arm.</p>

<p>"I am faint," muttered Dora in a
whisper, and she reached forth her
hands as if to save herself from falling
to the floor, while her eye closed as in
a deadly swoon.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, my beauty faints, does
she?" muttered Devil-Bug, catching
her form in his arms. "Werry purty
in the beauty, that is! It's a genteel
way o' sayin' she consents I s'pose."</p>

<p>With her head resting on his shoulder,
while her bosom almost touched
his face, Devil-Bug encircled her form
in his arms and bore her slowly along
the floor. He laid her gently down in
the chair, where her cloak had been
thrown.</p>

<p>Then stepping backward, he quietly
surveyed her voluptuous form while
that look of animal admiration reddened
over his face.</p>

<p>"She lays there werry beautiful&mdash;
her head thrown back a little, her eyes

<!-- page 305 col 1 -->

closed, and her red lips parted! Sich
white teeth! And that form, all dressed
in some gentleman's coat and pants;
ho, ho, it all belongs to me! Sich a
nice bosom! It looks quite purty, with
the shirt collar thrown wide open about
the neck! An' that's all mine!"</p>

<p>The swooning woman lay reclining
upon the folds of the cloak, flung over
the rounds of the chair, while the light
streaming over the back of Devil-Bug
fell mild and softened over her lovely
face with the eyelids closed as if in
death. Never had Dora looked so
beautiful. Never had her lips been
tinted with such a rose-bud freshness,
never had such a lively glow bloomed
from the fulness of her cheek, never
had the tresses of her unbound hair,
fell in such bewitching carelessness
around her countenance and along her
snowy neck.</p>

<p>She lay there like a beautiful incarnation
of sleep, while the savage stood
gazing upon her with a look of increasing
admiration. His solitary eye
grew loathsome with its expression of
brute passion, while his lips were
agitated by a hideous smile.</p>

<p>"Hello! My beauty's a-comin' too!
Look, she moves her head, she rests
it on the table at her side, her eye-lids
are openin' agin!"</p>

<p>In her unconscious state, Dora gently
moved her arm, and as gently laid the
hand upon the white cloth of the table.
At the same moment her eye-lids
faintly unclosed, and she gazed around
with a bewildered stare.</p>

<p>"Soh, my beauty's had a faintin'
spell all to herself," muttered Devil-Bug
with a hideous chuckle, as he approached
the side of the half-conscious
woman. "I believe I'll taste her lips."</p>

<!-- page 305 col 2 -->

<p>Laying his hand on her shoulder, he
stooped slowly down, and the shadow
of his face darkened her countenance.
His loathsome lips well-nigh touched
the ripe lips of the proud woman, when
her hand moved nervously along the
white cloth of the table. Nearer drew
his lips, his hot breath streamed over
her cheek.</p>

<p>"One kiss my purty beauty, only
one kiss!"</p>

<p>With one sudden bound Dora Livingstone
sprung from the chair, and
when Devil-Bug looked for her again,
she stood in the centre of the floor, her
eyes flashing fire, her long dark hair
streaming wildly from her brow, while
each extended hand, held a grim pistol
at the monster's heart.</p>

<p>"Now devil, I defy you!" she exclaimed
in a tone of withering scorn.
"With a loaded pistol in either hand,
I will fight my way from this den.
Advance but a step, and I will stretch
you out upon the floor a lifeless corpse!"</p>

<p>Devil-Bug started, and covered his
face with his hands, as if utterly confounded
by this sudden movement of
the beautiful woman.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha," the scornful laugh of
Dora broke on his ear. "Do I hold
the blood-hound at bay? Monster,
where is your courage now? Stand
back and let me pass, or I fire this
pistol!"</p>

<p>And with deadly aim she points the
pistol at his brawny chest. Devil-Bug
raised his face from his hands. Every
harsh lineament of his countenance
was convulsed with an expression of
fiendish laughter.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, what a sweet creetur you
are to-w be-sure! Be so kind as to
blow my brains out with them pistols&mdash;it

<!-- page 306 col 1 -->

'ill quite dissap'int me if you don't.
That's a good girl; oh fire away my
duck! Wot a pity it is for you that
them bull-dogs ain't got no balls in 'em!
Ha, ha! Wot in the devil made you
leave 'em down stairs with yer cloak,
while I showed yo' the way up in this
room? I didn't draw out the balls&mdash;of
course I didn't! Who the devil said
I did!"</p>

<p>Dora's face grew deathly pale. With
an involuntary gesture she extended
her hands&mdash;the pistols fell to the floor with
a heavy deadened sound.</p>

<p>"All is lost!" she muttered as her
hands dropped listlessly by her side.</p>

<p>"So it is!" cried Devil-Bug; and with
the celerity of lightning he sprang forward and
seized the pistols. "Ho,
ho, my gal, did I fool you that time?
The pistols <i>are</i> loaded, but you don't
get 'em agin! No you don't, upon my
word!"</p>

<p>"Fool that I was!" cried Dora with
a flashing glance. "Oh that I had
lodged the bullet in his heart!" She
turned away, and pressed her red lip
between her teeth until the blood started
from the skin.</p>

<p>"Now my ducky dear, down on
your knees and axe for marcy!"
Devil-Bug advanced with a scowling
brow, while each extended hand held
a pistol toward her form. "Down on
your knees, or I fire!"</p>

<p>"Fire!" echoed Dora, as her proud
lip curved with scorn. "Fire, and I
will thank you!" She folded her arms
and confronted the Savage with a fearless
brow.</p>

<p>"Pluck, reg'lar pluck!" exclaimed
Devil-Bug with a stare of involuntary
admiration. "But come my gal, you
made the bargain an' you must stick

<!-- page 306 col 2 -->

to it! I've stood foolin' long enough.
It's time to put an end to these small
matters. Now for the goold!"</p>

<p>He dropped the pistols on the floor;
with one convulsive bound like a wild
beast darting on his prey, he sprang
forward, and gathered his long arms
around the form of the proud woman,
while his rough face rested against her
velvet cheek, and her lip felt the pressure
of his kiss.</p>

<p>Starting with a shriek, she endeavored
to tear her form from his embrace,
but in vain. She, the proud
and haughty woman with the outcast
feasting on her lip and revelling on her
beauty! Even in that moment of despair
the thought aroused all her energies.
She sprang from his embrace,
her convulsive efforts for a moment
loosened the grasp of his arms, but in
another moment they gathered around
her form with a closer pressure, and
like a bird fluttering in the coils of a
snake, she lay in his power and at his
mercy.</p>

<p>She sank helplessly on her knees.
Devil-Bug bent over her kneeling form,
and with his arms gathered round her
waist, impressed his loathsome kiss
upon her pouting lips.</p>

<p>Nothing could save the proud beauty
now. Dishonored, and by a devil in
human shape! The thought filled her
veins with madness; her eyes seemed
all on fire with the terrible intensity of
her thoughts.</p>

<p>His hot breath streamed over her
cheek. His sneering chuckle echoed
in her ears like a death-knell. His
solitary eye drank in the beauty of her
countenance with a look of brutal passion.
Dora gathered her strength for
one last struggle. Her brain throbbing

<!-- page 307 col 1 -->

with wild delirium, she shouted a name
that rose to her lips, she knew not
why, she shouted a name of the olden
time.</p>

<p>"Luke!" she shrieked, tossing her
arms madly on high. "Luke! Save
me, oh save me!"</p>

<p>As if her voice had aroused the dead
from the grave, the secret door slid
back, and Luke Harvey stood revealed,
a dim taper held in his extended hand,
flashing its light over a pale face, spotted
with drops of blood, and marked
by a fearful gash which laid open the
flesh along the right temple. His
dress all torn and disordered was soiled
by the earth of the grave, and his long
black hair hung lank and stiffened
around his face. His eye, dark, piercing
and snake-like at all times, was
now animated by a lustre that seemed
supernatural.</p>

<p>There in that same doorway, which
the night before had been passed by
the husband in search of his guilty
wife, in that same doorway stood
Luke Harvey gazing upon the savage
and his victim with one fixed and
immoveable gaze.</p>

<p>"Luke save me, save me!" shrieked
Dora, unconscious that the man whom
she had sold to death, stood gazing
upon her peril. "Luke, oh save me!"</p>

<p>His head bent down, Devil-Bug suddenly
felt the gleam of a strange light
flashing over his face. He raised his
head, he beheld Luke standing silent
and pale in the doorway, and then
flinging Dora from him, uttered a wild
howl of surprise.</p>

<p>"G&mdash;d d&mdash;n!" was his solitary
ejaculation. "If there ain't that feller
come to life agin!"</p>

<p>He was about to rise from his feet,

<!-- page 307 col 2 -->

when the apparition rushed forward,
and seizing a pistol from the floor,
struck Devil-Bug a fierce and fearful
blow over the forehead.</p>

<p>His skull echoed the blow like a
piece of metal ringing on the anvil.
With a curse on his lips, Devil-Bug
rose fiercely to his feet, but the pistol
again descended, again that ringing
sound&mdash;the monster fell heavily to the
floor. He lay senseless as the oaken
planks on which he rested.</p>

<p>Thrown prostrate along the floor,
Dora arose into a kneeling position
and gazed around in speechless wonder.</p>

<p>Tall and erect, the dim light held in
his extended hand, Luke Harvey
stood before her, gazing down on her
face with a saddened and immoveable
look. The light flashing upward gave
a ghastly and fearful appearance to his
pale countenance, while his blazing eye
encountered hers, with a look so
strange and piercing, that she was
forced to avert her gaze.</p>

<p>"His ghost comes to reproach me!"
muttered Dora in an almost inaudible
yet thrilling whisper.</p>

<p>"Oh Dora, Dora," said a calm and
deep-toned voice, rendered fearful in
its very calmness, by its striking contrast
with the usual sneering tones of
Luke Harvey. "Oh Dora, Dora, little
did I think in the times when I
gathered you to my heart, and tasted
the freshness of your virgin lip, and
in very fondness of passion called you
my own sweet wife, little did I think
in those times, now gone forever, that
a moment could ever come, when I
would behold a scene like this! Dora,
whom I once so fondly loved, thrown
prostrate on the floor of this polluted

<!-- page 308 col 1 -->

chamber, her person, her honor, the
price of a cold-blooded murder! Oh
Dora, Dora you might have spared
me <i>this</i> shame!"</p>

<p>The sneer had gone from Luke's
tongue. He stood gazing upon the
kneeling woman with a trembling voice
and a look of agony. Even while he
looked a scalding tear rolled down his
deathly cheek.</p>

<p>"Your body, the price of a cold-blooded
murder!" he uttered in a whisper,
as his immoveable gaze was still
rivetted to her countenance.</p>

<p>"Murder!" echoed Dora, gazing
wildly in his face.</p>

<p>"Yes, murder," replied Luke in that
same tone of unnatural calmness. "I
overheard your plot Dora, overheard
every word. In the darkness I stood
beside the door of the room down stairs;
I saw you enter; I heard you bargaining
for my blood. Oh Dora, I have
felt something like a desire for revenge,
whenever I thought how you trifled
with my feelings and trampled on my
heart, but now Dora, <i>now!</i> You are
revenged upon me! Far better the
knife of the assassin had cut my heart
in twain, than to look upon you, in such
shame as <i>this!</i>" She was indeed revenged
upon him. There was agony
in his look and tone, in his pale face
and trembling voice, agony worse than
death.</p>

<p>Dora was silent. She bowed her
face on her bosom as she knelt at his
feet, she bowed her face and veiled her
eyes with her hands. The ring dropped
from her finger.</p>

<p>Luke knelt silently by her side. He
took the ring from the floor.</p>

<p>"This ring you gave me on the
night when you first consented to be

<!-- page 308 col 2 -->

mine&mdash;" he paid in that calm and
deep-toned voice. "Then it was the
testimonial of our love&mdash;now it is the
witness of your shame!"</p>

<p>Dora shuddered. That voice speaking
so sadly to her ear, penetrated her
very heart with remorse.</p>

<p>She raised her face from her bosom,
she gazed upon his countenance in
silence. It was a strange and awful
moment. The Rejected lover kneeling
beside the proud woman, at once the
faithless Mistress and the guilty Wife!</p>

<p>"Luke," she whispered in a tone
strangely in contrast with her usual
commanding voice. "Luke, if ever
you loved me, take that pistol from the
floor and place it to my forehead! I
am utterly lost&mdash;death would come to
me now like a welcome messenger!"</p>

<p>There was silence for a single moment.
They gazed sadly in each other's
faces, while the same thought rose
from each heart! Dora thought now
pure and happy would have been her
life, had she became the wife of Luke.
Luke thought how dear and holy a
thing she would have been to him as a
wife&mdash;she, the fallen and dishonored.</p>

<p>"Curse on the fate that severed us!"
he cried, wringing his hands with a
mad gesture.</p>

<p>"There is an awful gulf between us
now. I am lost, and lost forever!" said
Dora, as the first tears of repentance
which she had ever shed, rolled down
her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Dora, there is yet a glorious hope
for you!" cried Luke as his ghastly
features warmed with an expression of
enthusiasm that might almost have
been called holy. "Promise me that
you will renounce all unhallowed love,
promise me that you will from this

<!-- page 309 col 1 -->

time forth, dissolve all connection with
the poor creature who has dishonored
you by a foul crime, promise me that
you will ever be to Livingstone a true
and faithful wife; and I swear before
God, to sustain you in your course to
defend you from all harm!"</p>

<p>Oh that tone, that look, that beseeching
gesture of the rejected lover! Dora
was melted to the heart.</p>

<p>Radiant with all the beauty of a new
formed and holy resolve, she raised
her heart and eyes to heaven.</p>

<p>"I promise!" she cried, and the
tears rolled down her cheeks.</p>

<p>"I swear to sustain you to the death!"
cried Luke, raising his hands on high.</p>

<p>There was silence for a single moment,
and the character of the place in which
they knelt, the guilt of the wife, the
revenge of the lover, all were forgotten.
That Resolve hovered over their hearts
like the halo around the cross of a
dying saint.</p>

<p>In a moment Luke raised her gently
from the floor, and silently gathered
the cloak around her disguised form.
She reddened to the very roots of her
hair as he placed the cap upon her
head. Her ambition, her recklessness
of soul alike were gone; she felt the
modesty of a wife once more. She
stood ready to depart, while the form
of the insensible savage lay prostrate
on the floor.</p>

<p>"In a moment, Dora, I will be with
you," said Luke as he turned toward
the secret door. "In a moment I will
lead you from the place."</p>

<p>Dora was alone. Oh what a tide of
tumultuous thoughts came rushing
madly over her brain! As she stepped
across the floor it seemed to her that
she trod on air, that the present was

<!-- page 309 col 2 -->

some glorious dream from which she
would soon awake to the reality of life
and the pollution of crime. The tones
of her former lover lingered yet upon
her ear, how like the days of stainless
innocence and love! Then the affection
of Livingstone, his care for her
slightest wish, his doting love came
like a burst of sunshine on her soul.
With a trembling lip and flashing-eye,
she wondered to herself that idle toys
like the world's ambition and the love
which is born of guilt, should ever
have lured her from the duty of a wife,
the purity of a woman.</p>

<p>As these thoughts flashed over her
soul, Luke stood by her side again.</p>

<p>"Give this to your husband at the
earliest opportunity," he said as he
placed a sealed note in her hands.
"You start for Hawkewood in the
morning. For God's sake do not fail
to give him this."</p>

<p>Dora placed the note in her bosom.
Then her large eyes, dark as midnight
and lustrous as the morn, encountered
the glance of her former lover, and for
a moment they silently gazed upon
each other.</p>

<p>"Oh Dora, my fever of revenge is
past! Till this hour I never knew how
your image had wound itself into my
very heart!"</p>

<p>"And I would have been your assassin!"
Dora exclaimed, turning suddenly
pale. "Oh Luke, I am too vile
a thing for your slightest notice. I am&mdash;how
the word chokes me&mdash;I am an
<i>adulteress!</i>"</p>

<p>"Let the past be with the past!"
said Luke in a solemn tone, as taking
her hands within his own he raised
them on high. "Let us now in the sight
of Heaven confirm our mutual vow!"</p>

<!-- page 310 col 1 -->

<p>Fools that they were! As they
stood there in that lonely room, hand
linked in hand and eyes raised to
heaven, Fate was weaving its threads
of Doom around and about them; silent
and stern and immutable Fate was
surrounding them with its serpent-coils,
while it looked upon them in scorn,
and laughed in derision as its awful
hand pointed to the Future! To-morrow
it murmured&mdash;ha, ha&mdash;to-morrow!</p>

<p>And while they stood in that lonely
chamber, hand linked in hand and eyes
raised to Heaven, in his counting room
silent and alone, the husband mixed the
poison which on the morrow was to lay
his guilty wife a stiffened corpse.</p>

<p>Bending over the table on which
were scattered the various drugs
which composed the fatal draught,
bending over the table, with the light
of the taper falling upon his death-stricken
face, the husband laughed
madly to himself and whispered in
husky tones, "to-morrow, ha, ha, to-morrow!"</p>

<p>Fools that they were! To think that
Fate which drives its iron wheels over
hearts and thrones and graves, would
turn aside in its career for them!</p>

<p>"Away Dora," cried Luke, "away
from Monk-Hall!" They moved toward
the door. The wretch thrown
prostrate on the carpet, groaned.</p>

<p>"Ha! I forgot the keys!" cried
Luke, retracing his steps. "There
they are&mdash;" he bent over the form of
Devil-Bug. "In a moment your
escape is certain."</p>

<p>He led her from the room, and down
the stairs. In a few moments they
stood in the Doorkeeper's den. By the

<!-- page 310 col 2 -->

dim light the negroes might be discerned
sleeping by the fireside.</p>

<p>It required but another moment for
Luke to place the key in the lock, and
open the massive door.</p>

<p>She stood in the doorway with the
cloak thrown round her form and the
beams of the setting moon falling on
her face.</p>

<p>"Go, and God go with you Dora!"
whispered Luke, pushing her gently
from the door.</p>

<p>"Do you not go with me?" she
whispered as she paused upon the
threshold. "There is danger for you
within these walls, <i>perchance death</i>."</p>

<p>"I have other matters to arrange,"
answered Luke. "I must avenge
wrong and defend innocence. Go,
Dora, and remember your vow!"</p>

<p>He pushed her gently across the
threshold, he closed the door, and stood
alone in the Doorkeeper's den.</p>

<p>The negroes still slumbered by the
fireside, and the faint light of the fire
illumined the face of Luke with a
ghastly radiance.</p>

<p>He advanced toward the fire, he
placed his hand hurriedly against his
brow, while his eye grew animate with
strange and powerful emotion.</p>

<p>"The world would call me a fool
for acting thus," he whispered. "True,
she trampled on my heart, true, she
dishonored her husband, true, she bargained
with the ruffian for my life, but
God alone knows how the face we
once loved to look upon, ever maintains
a strange influence over the heart,
how the voice we once loved to hear,
even has a music for the soul! My
brain whirls in confusion&mdash;I am weakened
by the loss of blood&mdash;ah!"</p>

<p>Turning to regain the door which

<!-- page 311 col 1 -->

led into the mansion, he felt the
strength generated by the excitement
which had agitated his soul during the
past hour, he felt this unnatural strength
passing from him like a shadow, he
stretched forth his hands in the effort
to preserve his balance, but in vain!</p>

<p>With a cry of agony on his lips he
fell helpless to the floor.</p>

<p>Half an hour passed, and Devil-Bug
stood over the form of the prostrate
man with a light in his hand. He regarded
the pale face of Luke with a
scowl of fierce malignity. His own
distorted countenance, spotted with
blood near the temples and livid in hue,
assumed an expression of savage hate.</p>

<p>"Soh, Soh, mister, yo' helped the
woman to dig off, did yo'?" he muttered,
placing his foot upon the breast
of the insensible man. "I've a notion
to knife your wizzin'&mdash;wonders how
you'd look with a small air-hole in
your throat?"</p>

<p>He drew an old-fashioned spanish
knife from the breast of his coarse garment
as he spoke. The blade, long,
pointed and glittering, flew open with a
touch of the spring. Stooping over the
form of the insensible Luke, he applied
the knife to his unbared throat, and with
a wild grimace distorting his features,
he moved it gently along the skin.</p>

<p>"I on'y wants to see how near to
the skin I can go, without cuttin' his
w<i>y</i>nd-pipe! Ho, ho ho!"</p>

<p>There was a great deal of the philosopher
in Devil-Bug. Never a doctor
of all the schools, with his dissecting
knife in hand and the corpse of a subject
before him, could have manifested
more nerve and coolness than the
savage of Monk-Hall. Slowly and

<!-- page 311 col 2 -->

gently along the throat of the insensible
man, he moved the glittering knife,
holding its keen edge within a hair's
breadth of the skin. Then as if to
show that his spirits were not depressed
by the solemnity of the operation, he
laughed merrily to himself, and hummed
the catch of some dismal song.</p>

<p>Suddenly his protuberant brow grew
heavy with a scowl. He clenched the
handle of the knife with a grasp of
fierce resolution, and in a moment, the
blade glittered in his upraised hand.</p>

<p>"I'll put an end to this," he muttered
hoarsely. "I'll give him a taste
o' this piece o' hardware. Crack me
over the skull with the butt o' that 'are
pistol, did he?"</p>

<p>For a moment the knife quivered in
the air above his head, and the scowl
grew darker over his brow. The next
instant, as if some strange thought had
suddenly taken his soul by storm, the
frown cleared away and the knife fell
from his hand and stuck upright in the
oaken floor.</p>

<p>"Nell," he slowly muttered, "Yer
only hope lies <i>here!</i>" He pointed to
the body of the insensible Luke.
"Here lies yer hope, and yer fortin'&mdash;this
man can make all matters straight.
He can place yo' afore the proud folks
o' this town as the daughter o' Livingstone;
and nobody else can do it! I'd
rayther burn myself alive than to hurt
a hair of his head."</p>

<p>Stooping to the floor, he raised Luke
on his shoulder, he bore him from the
den, up the stairs, and into his room.
He laid the form of the insensible man
upon the bed, and then rushed hurriedly
from the room, and down the
stairs again.</p>

<p>In a few moments, the lamp which

<!-- page 312 col 1 -->

he held in his hand flashed over the
massive brick pillars of the dead vault.</p>

<p>The place was infested with a deathly
chill, and the atmosphere was like the
breath of a pestilence. Devil-Bug
gazed calmly round the vault, as if
marking the rows of coffins stored
away in the nooks of the walls, or the
fragments of the human skeleton
scattered along the floor. Then he
gazed upon the pillars of massive brick,
and then shifting the light from side
to side, he seemed to feel a strange
pleasure in observing the heavy
shadows which ran along the distant
walls, or crept over the arching ceiling
above.</p>

<p>"I'd a'most forgot it," he soloquized
as he seated his deformed body on the
floor. "The <i>doctor</i> sent for me last
night; the one what wants me to steal
dead bodies for him. I must go airly
in the mornin'; he pays me well; and
I likes the business. Sich a jolly business!
To creep over the wall o' some
graveyard in the dead o' the night,
and with a spade in yer hand, to turn
up the airth of a new made grave! To
mash the coffin lid into small pieces
with a blow o' the spade, and to drag
the stiff corpse out from its restin'
place, with the shroud so white and
clean, spotted by the damp clay! To
kiver the corpse with an old overcoat
or a coffee bag, and bear it off to the
doctor, with his penknifes and his daggers
and his gim'lets! Hoo, hoo!"
he emitted a wild imitation of the
screech-owl, from his compressed teeth,
"sich a jolly business!"</p>

<p>Then placing the lamp on the floor,
and drawing the fragment of a crumbling
coffin beneath his elbow, he rested
his brawny cheek upon his hand, while

<!-- page 312 col 2 -->

his solitary eye glared fiercely upon
the thick shadows of the vault. He
sat thus for a few moments, when his
senses were overpowered by slumber,
and he lay there huddled in a heap
along the floor, sleeping with his eye
wide open.</p>

<p>The light flashed over his face,
while the muscles worked as if under
the influence of a spell, the brow was
corrugated with wrinkles like thick
cords, the eye flashed and sparkled and
glared, the teeth were clenched together,
and then around the quivering lips, the
white foam began to gather like the
froth on the nostrils of the dying war-horse.</p>

<p>The soul of Devil-Bug was passing
through the mazes of a fearful dream.
This it was that made his eye glare
and his lips move, this it was sent the
cold shudder through his sleeping form;
this it was that clenched his hands and
made him grasp wildly at the air. As
he lay there, his soul absorbed by an
awful night-mare, a world of phantoms
passed before him.</p>

<p>The sight that he saw in his sleep,
the vision that broke upon him! Was
it a Revelation from the other world?
Was it a Prophecy whispered to the
monster's soul by the tongues of
angels?</p>

<p>CHAPTER FOURTEENTH.</p>

<p class="small">DEVIL-BUG'S DREAM.</p>

</div>

<p>WHEN first he slept, the phantoms
of his murdered victims rose before
him; the man with the broken jaw
and the lolling tongue, the woman with

<!-- page 313 col 1 -->

the blood falling drop by drop from the
hollow skull. Then the eyes of the
man started from his death-stricken
face, then he could see the neck of the
woman quiver as with the convulsive
throes of death, and then he could hear
the low-pattering sound of blood dropping
from the hollow skull. The
sleeper groaned in agony. The woman
reached forth her skinny arms and
clasped them round his neck, and applied
her thin lips wet with blood to his
ear, and whispered <i>Murder</i> in a tone
of horrible laughter.</p>

<p>And the man lolled his blackening
tongue&mdash;ugh! how clammy and how
cold! against the face of Devil-Bug,
and looked into his very soul with
those blood-shot eyes, almost touching
the forehead of the dreamer. Then
the dream became confused and wandering.
Devil-Bug was surrounded
by a hazy atmosphere, with coffins
floating slowly past, and the stars
shining through the eyes of skulls, and
the sun pouring his livid light straight
downward into a wilderness of new-made
graves, which extended yawning
and dismal over the surface of a boundless
plain.</p>

<p>Then the sun assumed the shape of
a grinning skeleton-head, and the stars
went dancing through the dim atmosphere,
dancing round the sun, each
star gleaming through the orbless
socket of a skull, and the blood-red
moon went sailing by, her crescent
face, rising above a huge coffin which
floated through the livid air like a
barque from hell. Then the sky was
full of comets darting along like lightning,
each comet with a long white
shroud sweeping the heavens as it
rushed through the air, and then sky

<!-- page 313 col 2 -->

and sun and moon and stars, were
succeeded by thick and impenetrable
darkness. There was a long pause,
and the darkness resolved itself into
shape. Devil-Bug stood in the midst
of a boundless plain, covered with a
darkness like that which betokens the
approach of day. The whole sky was
changed into one vast curtain, which
hung in midnight folds across the immensity
of space.</p>

<p>The dreamer looked upon this awful
curtain in awe and wonder.</p>

<p>"This," cried a voice speaking shrilly
from the darkness, "this is the curtain
of the Theatre of Hell!" And
then Devil-Bug laughed loudly to himself,
as if in glee at the merry conceit.</p>

<p>At the very instant there arose from
the dark plain, a chorus of shrieks and
groans and yells of agony. It was as
though the dying in some vast battle-field
had suddenly, in one breath, sent
their combined death-shrieks to the
heavens above. Yell on yell, groan
on groan continued to rend the air, and
then a horrible chorus of laughter
broke on the ear of the dreamer.</p>

<p>"This," cried the voice, "this is the
Orchestra of Hell!"</p>

<p>Then the curtain slowly rose. Up,
up, the dark folds ascended; higher,
higher! The theatre of hell lay bare
to his view. Devil-Bug started forward,
and looked upon the scene, and
howled in glee!</p>

<p>What he then beheld may never be
told to the ears of living man. Oh!
horrible and ghastly, that sight of all
sights the most dread! Oh, horrible
and ghastly! On every wave a lost
soul, on every breeze of that heated
air, a groan of death! That throne
rising black and lurid, from the centre

<!-- page 314 col 1 -->

of the chaos of flame&mdash;oh, picture its
horror to no living ear! But the fair
bosomed women, floating on those
waves, are they not spared? And the
babes, lifting their tiny hands on high, is
there no mercy for them? And the old
men, dashed against the red-hot rocks, is
there no deliverance for them? Look,
look! Strain your eyes, Devil-Bug,
behold that sight of grandeur! That
wave, ha, ha, see how it rises from

<!-- page 314 col 2 -->

the bosom of the sea, that wave of
fire! How it roars around the throne,
how it towers and swells! And in the
fiery surf which crests its summit,
look, look, there are millions of souls,
shrieking for mercy! Only a drop
of water, only a drop of water!</p>

<p>The orchestra of hell strikes up its
music, and the play goes on.</p>

<p>Suddenly all became dark again
and the dream changed.</p>

<h3>The Last Day of the Quaker City.</h3>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br/>

</div>

<p>HE stood in the wide street of a magnificent city. All around him, from lofty
windows, the glare of many lights flashed out upon the winter night. Above, the
clear cold sky of a calm winter twilight overarched the far extending perspective,
brilliant with light and life, which marked the extent and grandeur of that wide
street of a gorgeous city.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug looked around him, and beheld the sidewalks lined with throngs of
wayfarers, some clad in purple and fine linen, some with rags fluttering around
their wasted forms. Here was the lady in all the glitter of her plumes, and silks,
and diamonds, and by her side the beggar child stretched forth its thin and skinny
arm, asking in feeble tones, for the sake of God, some charity good lady! And
the lady smiled, and uttered some laughing word to the man of fashion by her side,
with his slim waist and effeminate face, she uttered a remark of careless scorn,
and passed the beggar-child unheeded by. Here passing slowly onward, with a
look of sanctimony, a white cravat and robes of sable, was the lordly Bishop, whose
firm step and salacious eye betokened at once his arrogance and guilt; here was
the man of law with his parchment book and his cold grey eye; here was the
Judge with his visage of solemnity and his pocket-book crammed full with bribes,
and here, hungry and lean, was the mechanic in his tattered garb, looking to the
clear blue sky above, as he asked God's vengeance upon the world that robbed
and starved him.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug rubbed his hands with glee. There was something so exhilarating
to him, in the sight of all this, in the spectacle of the lofty windows stored with
silks and satins, gold and jewels, enriched with the tribute of a whole world, in
the animation of the sidewalk, its crowds of wayfarers, its rich and poor, its
worldly and its holy men, that old Devil-Bug laughed gaily to himself and rubbed
his hands in very glee.</p>

<p>Wandering slowly onward, he was wrapt in wonder at the magnificence which
broke upon his vision, when suddenly a massive edifice rose before him, with long
rows of marble columns and a massive dome breaking into the blue of the sky far
overhead. Beside this gorgeous structure, which appeared to be in progress of
erection, for there was scaffolding about its columns and the implements of the
workmen were scattered around; beside this edifice arose a small and unpretending
structure of brick, only two stories high, with its plain old-fashioned
steeple rising but half-way to the summit of the marble palace. This small
and unpretending structure was in ruins, the roof was torn from the steeple, the

<!-- page 316 -->

windows were concealed by rough boards, and from one corner, the bricks had
been thrown down.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug, when he beheld this structure in ruins, while the marble palace by
its side arose in such grandeur upon the clear blue sky, smiled to himself and
clapped his hands boisterously together.</p>

<p>"This," he cried, pointing to the edifice, "this should be the old State House,
and I must be in the Quaker City!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, a ghostly form glided from among the gay wayfarers of the sidewalk,
and stood by his side, a ghostly form like a thin shape of mist with large
dark eyes flashing from its shadowy face. "It is the old State House," whispered
the ghostly form, in a voice that thrilled to the heart of the listener. "Yes it
is old Independence Hall! The lordlings of the Quaker City have sold their
father's bones for gold, they have robbed the widow and plundered the orphan,
blasphemed the name of God by their pollution of his faith and church, they have
turned the sweat and blood of the poor into bricks and mortar, and now as the last
act of their crime, they tear down Independence Hall and raise a royal palace
on its ruins!"</p>

<p>"What d'ye mean by that," cried Devil-Bug, fiercely. "<i>Royal</i> palace&mdash;hey?
That means something about a king, don't it?"</p>

<p>"King!" echoed the Ghost, in a sad and sorrowful tone. "Look at those proud
chariots rolling along the crowded street, look at those chariots with the horses
decked in tinselled trappings and with liveried retainers riding at their sides."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes I see 'em," cried Devil-Bug, in his coarse way. "Them carriages
with horses all rigged out like circus horses, an' with fellers ridin' alongside
dressed in monkey-jackets&mdash;what does it all mean, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Those chariots are the equipages of a proud and insolent nobility, who lord it
over the poor of the Quaker City! Yes, there rides a Duke, and there a Baron,
and yonder a Count! This palace is intended for the residence of a king! Liberty
long since fled from the Quaker City, in reality has now vanished in its very name.
The spirit of the old Republic is dethroned, and they build a royal mansion over
the ruins of Independence Hall!"</p>

<p>As the spirit spoke the blaze of lights grew more radiant, the sidewalk was
thronged by gayer wayfarers, the street resounded to the echo of chariot wheels,
and up to the clear sky, like the echo of Niagara, went the hum and confusion
of the wide city.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho," laughed Devil-Bug. "So they git on quite lively, do they? Stranger,
if I may axe sich a questi'n, whar is Girard College&mdash;hey?"</p>

<p>The eloquent eyes of the Ghost lighted up with an expression of speechless woe.
"They have torn it down to build this palace with its marble!" it answered, in a
tone of unutterable agony.</p>

<p>"And what year d'ye call this!"</p>

<p>"The year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and fifty," said the Spirit,
but Devil-Bug was not sure that he had heard aright. It seemed to him afterward;
that the Spirit had added a word to his enumeration of the time.</p>

<p>"And this King, whose palace is a-buildin' yonder, an' these Dukes and
Lords, who are ridin' in their big carri'ges yonder, what great deeds did they
ever do?"</p>

<p>"Cheated the poor out of their earnings, wrung the sweat from the brow of the
mechanic and turned it into gold, traded away the bones of their fathers, sold

<!-- page 317 -->

Independence Square for building lots, and built this palace for a King! These
are their mighty deeds!"</p>

<p>"It seems to me, stranger, that the King with his Dukes an' Lords ain't nothin'
but a pack o' swindlin' Bank d'rectors&mdash;hey? In the year eighteen forty-two,
there was some fuss made about a monument to Gin'ral Washington, in Washington
Square&mdash;can you tell me, stranger, whatever became of it?"</p>

<p>The Ghost led him silently through the archway of the ruined State House,
and in a moment they stood upon Independence Square, all cumbered with heaps
of marble and piles of building timber. The greater portion of the square was
occupied by the royal palace, but from the western extreme a free view of the
heavens might be obtained.</p>

<p>"Do you see that dark and gloomy building yonder?" exclaimed the Ghost,
pointing in a south-western direction.</p>

<p>"What, that great big jail of a buildin'? Why, stranger, that stands where
Washin'ton Square used to stand. What does it mean, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"It is indeed a gaol, built on the ground of Washington Square. Within its
gloomy cells, all those brave patriots are confined, the brave men who struck the
last blow for the liberty of the land, against the tyranny of this new-risen nobility.
There, day after day and night after night, with the rusted iron eating into their
wasted flesh&mdash;there they drag their lives away in darkness, in cold and hunger!"</p>

<p>"Hello! mister, isn't that a gallows I see yonder&mdash;opposite the jail? It's quite
comfortin' to see that old-fashioned thing alive yet!"</p>

<p>"It is a gallows!" said the Ghost. "And thanks to the exertions of some of
the Holy Ministers of God, it is never idle! Day after day its rope is distended
by the wriggling body of some murderer, day after day these merciful preachers
crowd around its blackened timbers, sending the felon into the presence of his God,
his ears deafened by their hallelujahs, while his stiffened hands grasp that Bible
whose code is mercy to all men!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted Devil-Bug. "The gallows is livin' yet! Hurrah!"</p>

<p>"For some years it was utterly abolished," said the Ghost.&mdash;"Murders became
few in number, convicts were restored to society, redeemed from their sins, and
the gaols began to echo to the solitary footsteps of the gaoler. But these good
Preachers arose in the Senate, and the Pulpit and plead beseechingly for blood!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the Preachers! Them's the jockies!"</p>

<p>"Give us but the gibbet," they shrieked. "Only give us the gibbet and we'll
reform the world! Christ said mercy was his rule, we know more about his religion
than he did himself, and we cry give us blood! In the name of Moses, in
the name of Paul, and John, and Peter, in the name of the Church, in the name
of Christ&mdash;give us the gibbet, only give us the gibbet!"</p>

<p>"They said this? The jolly fellers!"</p>

<p>"The gallows was given to them. The gibbet arose once more in the streets.
Murder become a familiar thing. Crime dyed its hands in blood, and went laughing
to the gibbet. The good Preachers plead for blood, and they had it!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" screamed Devil-Bug. "The gallows is livin' yet! Hurrah!" He
sprang from his feet in very glee, and clapped his hands and hurrahed again.</p>

<p>When he again looked round the Ghost had disappeared. Retracing his steps
through the archway, Devil-Bug stood on the sidewalk of the broad street again.</p>

<p>He passed along among the crowds of gay wayfarers, he passed many a princely
equipage, many a gorgeous chariot, and here and there at the corners of the streets

<!-- page 318 -->

or among the gayest of the laughing throng, he beheld a squalid beggar crouching
to the earth as he asked for bread, or a pale-faced mechanic in worn and tattered
clothes, who shook his hands in impotent rage as he beheld the stare of wealth
which flashed from the lofty windows as if to tantalize him with their splendor.</p>

<p>At last Devil-Bug stood in front of a lofty marble church which arose from the
centre of a graveyard. All around the massive church in the cold light of the
stars, arose long rows of whitened tomb-stones, with here and there a lordly monument
or slender obelisk, or lofty pyramid of snow white marble.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug looked at the church intently for a few moments, admiring its massive
structure and expansive dome, when to his utter astonishment the top of a
vault near the wall of the graveyard rose suddenly upward, and through the aperture
a shrouded form issued in the starlight and stood erect, lifting its hands to
heaven, while the death-shroud fluttered in the air.</p>

<p>Suddenly the figure turned, it advanced toward Devil-Bug: he started in utter
horror. A ghastly corpse with eye of leaden dimness gazing fixedly from a face
yellowed by decay stood before him. And as he started in horror from each marble
vault of the graveyard, from each rising mound from beneath each pyramid
and obelisk, arose the shrouded form of a corpse, and in an instant the place was
white with the fluttering shrouds of the multitude of dead.</p>

<p>On they came, advancing slowly toward the graveyard wall; on they came,
their hands crossed over their white shrouds, their leaden eyes gazing fixedly
forward, their foreheads all alive with the loathsome grave-worm. On they came
gliding over the wall, on they came, a throng of the ghastly dead. While Devil-Bug
started aside in horror, they glided over the graveyard wall, they mingled
with the gay throngs of the sidewalk, their white shrouds fluttering amid silken
gowns and velvet robes, their ghastly faces seen among gay visages, vacant with
the joy of a pleasure-loving world.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug beheld them file along the street, one by one, a long and fearful
train, he saw them pass beneath the glare of the lights, beneath the shadow of
the palaces, he saw them gliding slowly around, their leaden eyes wearing that
same fixed gaze, while their hands were folded on their breasts. With utter horror
he discovered that the gay revellers of the street beheld them not. They
walked merrily round while the arisen dead glided all around them, they smiled
gaily, unconscious of the leaden eyes that were gazing so sadly in their faces, they
rent the air with laughter, unheeding the rustling sound of the thousand death-shrouds
that swept the fringe of their costly robes.</p>

<p>Oh what unutterable agony was painted upon the faces of the arisen dead, as
they discovered that the living beheld them not! How their blue lips moved,
yet uttered no sound, how their white hands were upraised as if in warning,
while the worms went crawling round each brow.</p>

<p>"What does this all mean!" shouted Devil-Bug, in utter dismay. "Good folks
don't you see that the dead's among you? Good lady, look there, look! There's
a walkin' corpse at yer shoulder! Fine gentleman, look, look! There's a dead
man at yer back! Look! the whole graveyard is emptyin' itself into the street,
look, ye fools, I say look!"</p>

<p>He screamed and shouted as seized with an agony, whose origin he could not
comprehend, he felt himself forced to declare the awful spectacle which he beheld,
to the ears of the pleasure-loving citizens, but he screamed and shouted in vain.</p>

<p>They heard him not. The lord rolling by in his gilded equipage, was unconscious

<!-- page 319 -->

of the shrouded corpse that looked in his window, the beggar in the gutter
knew not that the form of a friend, long since dead, was now gazing sadly upon
his misery.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug gazed far along the street, and to his amazement, beheld a long
multitude of shrouded dead, walking beneath the flaring lights as far as eye could
see, until the magnificent perspective was lost in a mass of vacant darkness.</p>

<p>"Good folks," shouted Devil-Bug in horror&mdash;"Hello! Don't you see yer town
is alive with dead!"</p>

<p>"Let them alone, let them alone!" said a mild and saddened voice.</p>

<p>Rushing madly along the street, Devil-Bug turned hurriedly around.</p>

<p>The pale Ghost was at his side.</p>

<p>"Let them alone," it cried in that low-toned voice. "The dead arise around
them, to warn them of their coming doom, yet they know them not! These are
their friends, their relatives, their wives, their sisters, their brothers, risen from
the grave, to warn them of their doom, but their sealed eyes behold them not!"</p>

<p>"Their doom!" echoed Devil-Bug. "Speak plain will ye? What d'ye mean?"</p>

<p>"Behold!" cried the stranger, pointing to a black cloud which arose from the
blue in the western sky.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug looked and beheld written on the cloud, words in letters of fire,
which he could not read.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" he shrieked, turning to the figure at his side.</p>

<p>"The angel of the Judgment writes the doom of this proud city, from the heavens
his hand is extended, behold the words of flame on yon glistening cloud."</p>

<p class="center">WO UNTO SODOM</p>

<p>Devil-Bug looked upon these characters of flame and felt a strange awe penetrate
his heart.</p>

<p>"Come," cried the Ghost, "I will show you sights that no human eye may see,
I will unseal your ear to sounds that no human ear may hear!"</p>

<p>Devil-Bug felt himself borne upward, he felt himself hurried with the speed of
wind along the crowded street.</p>

<p>And he was borne along from every graveyard, he beheld the shrouded dead
arise, beheld them pour out upon the thronged sidewalk, he saw them lift their
hands on high, he saw them fix their leaden eyes upon the faces of the living with
a look of unutterable woe. From lonely burial places, from the banks of the
broad river, from the grounds of the prison, up started the shrouded dead, nay
from the very bricks of the crowded pavement they rose, and joined the snow-white
multitude who thronged the streets.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug and his guide stood at the foot of a gallows, which arose like an
evil omen upon the night. The corpse of a convict hung in chains, swung heavily
to and fro. As Devil-Bug looked, the convict came down from his gibbet, and
clanking his chains on high, with a hideous face festering with corruption, and
lighted by leaden eyes gleaming with all the malignity of hell, the felon-corpse
rushed by and joined the train of the dead.</p>

<p>Through street after street, through avenue after avenue, Devil-Bug was borne
by his ghastly guide, but every wide street, every avenue, each pathway and
sidewalk was crowded by throngs of laughing citizens, mingling with the multitudes
of the shrouded dead.</p>

<!-- page 320 -->

<p>"What does all this mean?" cried Devil-Bug to the Ghost at his side.</p>

<p>"This night is a festival night with the lordlings of the city. To-morrow they
will hold a grand revel through the whole extent of the wide town, and to-morrow&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Ghost paused. It pointed to the lurid cloud overhead with the letters of
flame written on its darkness, and as it pointed, a sad smile stole over its lips, and
it whispered,</p>

<p class="center">WO UNTO SODOM</p>

<p>"To-morrow" shrieked the spirit, "To-morrow will be the last day of the Quaker
City. The judgment comes, and they know it not."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he set Devil-Bug down again in front of Independence Hall.
"Listen to the song of the dead!" cried the Ghost. "Hark how they sing as they
mingle with the crowds of light-hearted revellers! Hark how their low-toned
song breaks like a funeral hymn on the air&mdash;hark!"</p>

<p>And as the shrouded dead glided along, mingling unseen with the gay and living,
there broke from their livid lips a fearful song, uttered in a low and moaning
chaunt that arose to the heavens in notes of prayer and execration.</p>

<p>A single voice pealing from among the dead, moving along the street, as they
sang the solemn hymn, prayed God to curse the Quaker City.</p>

<p>Then the whole legion of the dead shrieked in one horrible chorus, "Wo unto
Sodom! Anathema Marantha!"</p>

<p>"Cursed be the city," cried that solitary voice, leading the supernatural choir.
"Its foundations are dyed in blood. The curse of the poor man is upon it, and the
curse of the orphan. The widow, with her babes starving at her breast, raises her
hands and curses it in the sight of God. Wo unto Sodom!"</p>

<p>And the ghastly train, extending far along the streets, their stiffened hands
folded upon their white shrouds, took up the cry with their livid lips and chaunted
in a low yet horrible tone&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wo unto Sodom, wo! Anathema Marantha!"</p>

<p>"It has burned the Churches of the Living God. It has torn His Cross from
the Altar, it has soiled His banner with dust and ashes! Even the graves of the
dead it has not spared. The hands of violence have torn the bones of the dead
from their graves, and flung them mockingly beneath the hoofs of the horses.
Cursed be the city. Wo unto Sodom!"</p>

<p>"Wo unto Sodom! The hour of doom draweth nigh. The Church of the living
God in ruins curses it; the Cross polluted and covered with ashes curses it;
the grave torn open by the hand of violence and the bones of the dead, curse the
city before the throne of God! Anathema Marantha!"</p>

<p>Again that solitary voice resumed its chaunt of death and wo.</p>

<p>"The poor man toils in want, and the rich man riots in his sweat and blood.
Wo unto Sodom! The guiltless and the innocent pine in the dungeon, while the
unholy judge feasts upon the price of bribery and shame. The corpse of the innocent
swings upon the gibbet, and the worms crawl over its brow, while the Murderer
rides in his chariot, his proud form clothed in fine linen and his guilty face
decked in smiles! Accursed in the sight of God be Sodom, now and forever!"</p>

<p>And all along the street, from the ten thousand thousand dead, arose the
response&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 321 -->

<p>"Amen! Accursed in the sight of God be Sodom, now and forever! Amen
and Amen. Anathema Marantha!"</p>

<p>And thus, in low and solemn tones, the solitary Spirit recounted the foul litany
of the city's crimes, and as each hideous deed of wrong or murder fell from his
livid lips; the multitude of the dead raised up their voices and shrieked, "Amen
and Amen! Accursed be Sodom, now and forever! Anathema Marantha!"</p>

<p>The curse seemed to pierce the ear of Heaven. From the sky, shadowy forms
of grandeur looked down upon the scene, and suddenly a figure of awful and majestic
beauty, bent from the dim azure and waved a flaming sword across the
heavens. Up to the sky like the blast of the last trumpet swelled the Anathema
of the arisen dead, and from the blackness of the cloud, overhanging the city like
an embodied curse, flashed the letters of doom, Wo unto Sodom!</p>

<p>"Accursed be the city in the sight of Nations! It has torn the flag of Freedom
from the rock, and dashed it in the dust."</p>

<p>"Accursed be the city in the sight of God!" shrieked the voices of the dead.
"Wo unto Sodom! Anathema Marantha!"</p>

<p>And then they raised their leaden eyes to heaven and clenched their cold white
hand on high, and then their solemn chaunt was heard once more&mdash;</p>

<p>"Accursed be the city before the throne of God! It has torn the flag of Freedom
from the rock, and trailed it in the dust. Wo Unto Sodom, wo!"</p>

<p>And through the streets they wound, this ghastly multitude, circling among
the careless crowd, their hands crossed on their breasts and their leaden eyes
raised up to heaven, and far, far along each avenue they extended, one awful train
of shrouded dead, moving slowly onward while around them swelled the hum and
roar of the gay city holding its carnival.</p>

<p>And still up to the heavens arose the chaunt of the solitary voice, and still like
the thunder-blast of the last trump arose the dread response, "Wo unto Sodom.
Amen and Amen. Anathema Marantha!"</p>

<p>The scene changed. Suddenly Devil-Bug was borne upward through the air
and the city passed from his view. All was night, and blackness, and silence.</p>

<p>He looked around again, and an exclamation of wonder burst from his lips. He
stood upon the portico of a proud palace, which arose from the midst of a dark and
angry river. The palace was reared upon a solitary island which broke the fury
of the waves in the centre of the river. Devil-Bug looked to the west, and beyond
the channel of the river, he beheld the dim and dusky outlines of the magnificent
city extending north and south in one dark mass of roofs and walls, with here and
there a heavy dome or towering steeple rising into the sky, while from the lurid
cloud overhead a strange light was flung upon the darkness of the scene. And
from that cloud, hovering in mid-heaven, that cloud so lurid, so black and dismal,
from that mass of ominous darkness, flashed the red-words of flame, "Wo unto
Sodom."</p>

<p>All around the isle burst and foamed the waves of the swollen river. The torrent
was choked with masses of ice, and a rustling, heaving sound went ever
more up to the heavens.</p>

<p>Looking to the west, Devil-Bug beheld the black outlines of the city, with the
light from that fearful cloud playing upon its roofs and domes, but as he gazed
upon the east, all was thick darkness, with the broad waves of the river moaning
and foaming in the blackness of the night. Here and there a towering wave

<!-- page 322 -->

rose heaving into view as it caught a faint gleam of light from the cloud above
the far-off city, but it suddenly sank again into the bosom of night and all was
darkness, thick as chaos.</p>

<p>As Devil-Bug standing on the roof of the palace, gazed round in wonder, the
river became the scene of a strange and awful spectacle. The waves were suddenly
crowded by a fleet of coffins, tossed wildly to and fro, each coffin borne
upon the surface of the waters like a boat, with the foam dashing over its dull
dark outlines. And in each coffin sate a corpse, with the death-shroud enfolding its
limbs and waving along the blackness of the night, while it urged its grave-boat
merrily over the waters, using a thigh-bone for an oar. And at the foot of every
coffin, which served for the prow of the unearthly boat, was a lurid light burning in
a skull, and flinging its radiance around over the waters, over the faces of the dead
and over the fluttering folds of each death-shroud. Ten thousand coffins, each
bearing its boatman in the form of a shrouded corpse, floated on the surging waves
of the river, ten thousand lurid lights, each flaring from the eyeless sockets of a
skull, gave a terrible radiance to the scene, and the river, far as the eye could
see, was crowded by this fleet of grave-boats with their shrouded oarsmen, tossing
the water aside with the skeleton bone for an oar.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug shouted aloud in the wildness of his glee. Ha, ha! Ho, ho! There
was something so merry to his fancy in the spectacle of a broad river crowded by
a fleet of coffins, something so joyous in the light flaming from the orbless eyes
of ten thousand skulls, something so grotesque and horrible in shrouded corpses,
scattered over the surface of the river, that Devil-Bug felt a strange frenzy of
glee darting through his veins; he raised his hands and shouted for very joy.</p>

<p>As Devil-Bug looked around in fiendish glee, a new wonder met his gaze. The
fleet of coffins parted suddenly into two divisions, and each division arrayed
itself as if in the order of battle. On the north, from the island to the city, over
the surface of the waters extended one grim line of coffins, with a livid corpse
setting upright in each coffin, and raising the skeleton bone aloft in the stiffened
hand, while their white shrouds waved like banners upon the night.</p>

<p>On the south, with a broad path of waves between, another grim line of coffins
extended from the island to the river, the white shrouds of the corpses borne aloft
by the wind, while ten thousand deathly hands swung the thigh-bone wildly overhead.
In front of each line of coffins burned the lights, flaring from the orbless
eyes of a skull, and now as the lurid rays gave strange radiance to the scene, the
faces of each corpse, the leaden eyes, the blue lips and the brow all green and
clammy with decay, became fired with deadly rage, and beating the thigh-bone on
the side of each coffin, the antagonist lines of the dead began to move slowly towards
each other.</p>

<p>Then an unearthly peal of music broke upon the air&mdash;the music of the hollow
skull echoing to the blow of the skeleton-bone&mdash;from side to side it swelled, it
rose clanking to the heavens, it deafened the ear of night with its infernal din.
Nearer and nearer to each other the opposing lines of coffins drew, faster and
faster they glided over the waves, wilder and more terrible swelled the music of
the skeleton-bone and the skull!</p>

<p>Now the opposing lines of the dead glared in each other's faces. Now they raised
their stiffened hands as if eager for the onset, and waved their white shrouds in
the air. Now a thin line of water lay between each division of the dead. Hissing

<!-- page 323 -->

and whirling and plunging, the combatants drew near each other, with a low
muttered groan, far more terrible than the loudest shout, each party hailed the
approach of its opponent, and then with one deafening crash they closed together,
corpse fighting with corpse, dead throttling dead! Coffin meeting with coffin,
each urged onward by the heaving waves, each crashing madly into the prow of
its antagonist, while the dead arise, and leaning over the side of their death-boats,
they reach forth their arms and grasp each other in the clutch of an infernal hate!
Then how the fires flaring from the orbless eyes of skulls danced to and fro. Now
the river grew alive with the white robes of shrouds fluttering on the air, with the
gleam of lights hissing as they sank beneath the waters, with that horrible groan
of the corpse as it fought with its fellow corpse!</p>

<p>Then how merrily the music of the skeleton-bone and the hollow skull shrieked
over the waters, and mingling with the low-muttered groans of ten thousand, thousand
corpses, rose echoing to the heavens above! Then crash upon crash with
horrible yells of laughter, the shrouded dead again urged their coffins full upon
each other, and fought like living men upon a battle-field! With ghastly faces
mouldering with corruption, yet fired by all the passions of life, upturned to the
sky, with the waves rearing and plunging all around them, with their shrouds
tossing madly on the air, while the skull-fires danced to and fro they closed together
in terrible combat, and fought amidst the howling of the waters.</p>

<p>Another peal of the skeleton-bone and the skull, another wild burst of laughter.
Like a flash of lightning the scene was changed.</p>

<p>The river was calm as the joy of the Saint, first awakening from the sleep of
the grave into the peace of God's own sweet rest. Pure, serene, and placid. It
lay like a mirror before the eyes. Yet still in the sky overhead, hung the cloud
with its letters of flame,&mdash;Wo unto Sodom&mdash;still from the letters of flame a lurid
light fell over the waters, now so calm and tranquil. And the dark mass of walls
and roofs which marked the position of the city, with the lofty steeples and proud
domes steeped in livid light, was reflected in the calm waters, like a magnificent
picture, delineated by some unearthly hand.</p>

<p>And along the calm waters marched a long and winding Column of the dead,
gliding over the bosom of the river, their stiffened feet but touching the smooth
surface, while their solemn faces were upraised to the sky, and their white
shrouds fell in drooping folds around their awful forms. Gliding over the waters,
two abreast, a long column of the dead, their ghostly figures mirrored in the
depths below, they sang a low-toned and solemn song.</p>

<p>Oh how its notes of awful tenderness and feeling floated on the still air, how
that soft melody filled all space and breathed forth upon the universe, like a perfume
from eternal flowers. Softly and gently it floated over the river, that wild
and bewitching lament for the dead. Now it died sadly away until a whisper of
deep and absorbing melody was all that broke upon the silence of night, then
loud and louder it rose, it filled the sky, and like a chorus of angel-voices seemed
to hold earth and heaven, enchained with its deathless song.</p>

<p>It was a lament for the dead. It was a lament for the dead who were to die on
the morrow. It was a lament for young maidens, for grey-haired and helpless
men, for smiling and sinless babes. All were to be mingled in the destruction
of the morrow, all were to share the doom and the death of the Last Day of the
guilty and idolatrous city.</p>

<!-- page 324 -->

<p>The lament wept its tears of melody for them, the young and beautiful&mdash;it wept
for grey-haired age&mdash;it wept for smiling innocence.</p>

<p>Suddenly its notes changed from sadness to joy. Joy to the captive in his cell,
joy to the sick man on his couch, joy to the felon who was to die on the morrow;
Joy to the poor, oh joy! Their day was come at last. The rich with their purple
and fine linen had enjoyed the world long enough; now the God of the Poor
would arise in his might, and crush the lordlings under the heel of his power!
What cared the Poor if they too shared the ruin? Was it not triumph to see
the rich and corrupt dragged down from their high places&mdash;was it not triumph
worth all the deaths in hell?</p>

<p>Therefore the band of shrouded dead, winding over the smooth surface of the
river, sang joy to the poor, joy to hunger, joy to starvation, misery, and wo. Joy
to ye all! Your God arises; his arm is uplifted; already the rumbling of his
chariot wheels draw near! No more hunger now, no more crying for bread.
No more huddling down in squalor, and want, and cold. The avenger comes&mdash;Shout
ye poor, shout from your factories and work-benches, from your huts and
dens of misery shout! Hail to the Last Day of the guilty and blood-stained City!</p>

<p>As the last echo of the song broke on the air, the forms of the dead, their mouldering
faces, and their white shrouds, faded slowly from the view, and the day began
to dawn in the east. The last day of the Doomed city! Streaking the east
with faint grey and then with soft crimson and then with purple and gold, the
day arose upon the river and the city. Devil-Bug looked for the cloud: it was
gone; gone with its letters of flame: the night with its Phantoms was over.
And now the day came on, the awful day preceded by that Night of Omen and
Prophecy. The Last Day of the doomed city&mdash;all hail!</p>

<p>The laughing waves of the river caught the red gleam of the rising sun, and
the proud domes shone like masses of burnished silver, and the steeples rose glittering
in the sky.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug beheld the sun arise in grandeur, he saw the stars fading away before
the day-god, slowly and solemnly as they looked their last glance upon the
beautiful earth, he gazed upon the blue sky and marked the flashes of purple and
gold, warming upward to the very zenith. It was a glorious day, this last day of
ten thousand years of blood and crime. The air was freshening and balmy
although it was winter, and the broad river rippled in innumerable tiny waves,
caught the sunbeam on its transparent surface and smiled in welcome of the
rising day.</p>

<p>As Devil-Bug gazed around, the palace on which he stood sank suddenly beneath him.
Like a rock hurled from some dizzy height it sank; one moment its
towers gleamed in the light, the next instant a small, narrow and barren islet
uprising from the waves, like the back of some huge ocean monster, assumed the
place of the gorgeous fabric. The palace was gone, and a flood of sunlight poured
over the river, where its shadow but a moment before had darkened the waves.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug was suddenly lifted from the isle by invisible hands and borne across
the waters towards the mighty city. The waves laughing beneath him, and the
clear sunshine around, he was borne slowly onward. As he glided through the
air, a strange wonder met his gaze. On the surface of the river floated a solitary
coffin, containing a stiffened corpse, whose white shroud and ashen face lay open
to the warm gold of the sunbeams, while its fixed and leaden eyes gazed steadfastly
upon the sky.</p>

<!-- page 325 -->

<p>"Ha, ha!" shrieked Devil-Bug. "It's the corpse of Lorrimer&mdash;hurrah!" A
strange glee animated his breast. As his loud laugh broke upon the air the corpse
arose in its coffin and flung the folds of its white shroud to the winds. It tossed
its arms on high and echoed the glee of the Dreamer with a ghastly laugh. Then
borne onward by the tiny waves, the coffin floated down the river. A low muttered
chaunt broke from the lips of the corpse, and then sitting erect with the
white shroud fluttering on the winds, it went sailing merrily over the waves.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried Devil-Bug. "It's the corpse of Lorrimer&mdash;hurrah!"</p>

<p>As his laugh shrieked along the winter air, the river and the coffin with its
corpse rushed from his view. He stood in the streets of the wide city once again,
and the awful Drama, which formed the soul of his Dream, wore on to its last scene.</p>

<p>The streets of the doomed city were utterly deserted. Devil-Bug wandered
up and down, but gained no sight of a human face. A strange panic seemed to
have laid hold of the denizens of the proud town. They kept within the shelter
of their homes; the lord within his mansion, the king within his palace, the beggar
within his hut. The streets were deserted by the living, and yet up and down
the wide avenues glided the white bands of the countless dead. Up and down the
wide avenues, evermore and unceasing, their cold white hands crossed on their
breasts and their leaden eyes glaring steadily forward, glided the corpses of the
night before. And the warm sunlight shone full upon their ghastly faces, upon
the livid lips and the discolored cheeks. Their leaden eyes,&mdash;O! merciful God,
how fixed and ghastly was their glare!&mdash;Their leaden eyes were turned to
horrible gold. The loathsome worms crawling around each forehead, glistened
gaily in the light, and wreathed a hideous coronet of death upon each festering
brow!</p>

<p>Devil-Bug passed along amid these shrouded forms, he passed along unheeding
their ghastly faces and their frozen looks. He had grown used to these sights
of horror. He passed swiftly onward, noting the grandeur and magnificence of
the streets, the temples of marble, the mansions of towering splendor, the churches
with their lofty steeples and the halls of pleasure with their glittering domes.</p>

<p>And as he passed along he noted with strange awe a new omen of the day. The
towering mansions along the wide streets were sinking slowly into the earth,
slowly and almost imperceptibly, inch by inch they were sinking into the hard
ground. Wherever Devil-Bug passed, this wonder met his gaze. In narrow
alleys and in spacious streets, the same fearful spectacle was exhibited the wide
town was sinking slowly into the bosom of the earth.</p>

<p>Suddenly the streets became alive with people. From obscure huts in lonely
alleys, and from lordly palaces along far vista-ing streets, from quiet dwellings
and from gorgeous mansions poured the contrasted multitude. It was a gala-day
in the city. It was the anniversary of the death of Freedom. The King was to be
crowned, and the multitude were gathered in grand procession to swell his triumph.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug stood in front of the Ruins of Independence Hall. Along the wide
street, as far as eye might behold, was one living sea of banners and plumes,
bayonets and spears. Horses with glittering trappings and gallant riders were
speeding to and fro; armed bands thronged the streets. There were chariots all
glistening with cloth of gold, there were long files of liveried retainers, there were
proud lords glittering in purple and jewels, and enthroned on a royal seat, perched
on the summit of a splendid structure, a mimic temple borne on wheels and drawn
by milk-white steeds, above the gleam of spears and the flutter of banners, sate
the King. He looked to the blue heavens and smiled; it was such a glorious

<!-- page 326 -->

day! He was to be crowned again, in honor of the anniversary of his triumph.
The sunshine streamed over his dark and swarthy face; the breeze played with
the ringlets of his jet-black hair.</p>

<p>The King glanced over the living sea and smiled again. The heaven above,
was the only space that met his eyes, that was not occupied by banners and
plumes, stern visages and merry faces. From the roof to the gutters on either
side of the wide street, all was glitter and show. Fair forms crowded the lofty
windows, and white hands flung showy scarfs upon the air. Aged matrons lifted
little children upon high, and pointing toward the throne, bade them look upon
the King! White bosoms rose heaving in the sun at the sight of his stern
majesty; bright eyes glanced upon him in pride. Along the roofs of the houses,
along the sidewalks of the street, clinging to the pillars of the uprising palace,
nay, over the ruined walls of Independence Hall, gathered the dense multitude,
young and old, rich and poor, gazing with fixed interest upon the triumph of
their King. Purple and rags, grey-hairs and cherry lips, smiling foreheads, and
wrinkled cheeks, all were mingled in strange contrast!</p>

<p>It was a grand day and a glorious sight&mdash;that sky of blue, that cheerful sun,
that long vista of palaces and pillared mansions, that dense mass of people, that
glittering array of spears, and plumes, and banners, with the proud King sitting
enthroned above all.</p>

<p>The procession began to move. First came the music rending the air with its
martial joy, the peal of bugle, the roll of drum, and the clang of cymbals! Huzza!
How that cheer of the mob shrieked up to the sky! Then came the banner-knight
surrounded by throngs of brave warriors, and riding on a milk-white steed.
His firm arm swung aloft the Red Banner of the city, with the Crown, and his
Chain emblazoned on its folds. Huzza! Another cheer from the mob, at the
sight of the Crown and Chain! Then solid files of soldiers were tramping by,
their bayonets gleaming in the light, their plumes waving in the air. Then came
the temple drawn by milk-white steeds, and the King sitting on the throne,
raised his glance to the heavens, while his proud lip curled in scorn. He despised
the multitude whose necks were under his feet.</p>

<p>And at this moment, as his eye was fixed upon the heavens, while the proudest
jewel in his Crown, shone like a meteor in the light of the sun, at his very
shoulder stood a ghastly corpse, its stiffened limbs folded in a white shroud, its
dull, dead eyes fixed upon his visage&mdash;the visage of the King. He saw it not.
There, there upon the summit of the temple, beside his very crown it stood, but
he saw it not! Its clammy visage was all alive with hideous grave-worms, and
its fearful eye was gazing sadly into his own&mdash;into the proud eye of the King&mdash;but
he saw it not.</p>

<p>Nor did the vast crowd of living men behold the dead multitude as it mingled
with them, and crowded away their ranks. Nor did the soldiers tramping in
pride, behold the files of dead men, marching amid the glory of their banners, all
uniformed in deathly shrouds. Yes, yes, on every side gathered the legions of the
shrouded dead, amid the ranks of the Procession, in the lofty windows, along the
sidewalks, on the roof-tops, and on Independence Hall, they gathered, that band
of countless dead.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug beheld them, he alone of all that innumerable crowd, beheld the
corpses in their shrouds. He beheld them and laughed in glee. It was a sight of
glory, a sight of maddening glory to the King as he looked over the soldiers&mdash;but

<!-- page 327 -->

the corpse at his side, with its dull dead leaden eyes fixed upon his face&mdash;ah, ha!
he saw it not. It raises its arm, it places its stiffened hand upon the shoulder of
the King. He feels no pressure of the cold, dead fingers, but looks upon the
living crowd, and smiles.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug laughed until his sides ached again. An old and withered man
standing at his side, looked up at the sound of that wild laugh, and Devil-Bug
felt the glance of a cold grey eye fixed upon his face.</p>

<p>"Why do you laugh?" said the old man in a deep and mournful voice. "Know
you not Liberty is buried to-day? This is her funeral!"</p>

<p>Devil-Bug laughed loudly, yet again, and pointed to the Procession, with its
pomp and banners.</p>

<p>"That's why I laugh!" he cried. "Only look at the Crown and Chain, and
then look at Independence Hall&mdash;ho, ho, ho!"</p>

<p>The old man drew him aside into a dark corner. Under his arm, he carried
a huge port-folio.</p>

<p>"I'm an antiquary," he said in that low-toned and mournful voice. "I gather
up the relics of the past&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A sort o' cur'osity-monger?" suggested Devil-Bug.</p>

<p>"Look here!" whispered the old man. "Be careful that no one sees you,
it will cost you your life. Look there!"</p>

<p>He placed a piece of damp cloth in the hands of Devil-Bug.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug gazed upon it with some interest. He unrolled it and threw its
colors, alas! how faded and tarnished! he threw its colors open to the glare of the
day. It was an old banner, an old banner with thirteen crimson stripes, and
twenty nine white stars, emblazoned on a blue field.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho," chuckled Devil-Bug. "Why this is the 'Merykin Flag!' "</p>

<p>"That <i>was</i> the American Flag," said the grey-eyed antiquary.</p>

<p>"<i>Was?</i>" echoed Devil-Bug.</p>

<p>"<i>Was</i> the American Flag, I say! There is no America now. In yonder
ruined Hall, America was born, she grew to vigorous youth, and bade fair to live
to a good old age, but&mdash;alas! alas! She was massacred by her pretended
friends. Priest-craft, and Slave-craft, and Traitor-craft were her murderers. And
now, a poor old Antiquary has to skulk like an assassin through the street, because
he has discovered a relic of the olden time, and bears it with him&mdash;&mdash;this proscribed
and forbidden Flag!"</p>

<p>The old man bowed his head.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho! Yonder's the purty banner, with the crown and the Chain!
Hurrah!"</p>

<p>As Devil-Bug laughed in his frenzied glee, the old man concealed the Flag, in
the port-folio under his arm, and walked silently away.</p>

<p>The procession came sweeping by in all its royal pomp. After the temple
with its throne and King, came the sacred Clergy, in all the pride of priestly
robes and godly faces. Walking four by four, they talked eagerly together,
and disputed with great force and energy upon subjects of grave import. Various
banners marked their various creeds. One fat-faced parson swung aloft a
banner of white with a grim gibbet pictured on its folds. Hurrah! The mob
yelled in grateful applause at the sight&mdash;&mdash;the gibbet and the good old gallows'
law, they shouted, the gibbet and gallows' law forever!</p>

<!-- page 328 -->

<p>Then came another preacher with lanthern-jaws, and an eye like a vulture's.
He swung aloft a banner of sable, dark as midnight, with "Eternal Death" emblazoned
in its dark surface in lively letters. Hurrah&mdash;hurrah! That mob was
a pure old fashioned orthodox mob! Eternal death forever they shrieked.
Eternal death in the next world, for every soul that disbelieves in our creed&mdash;&mdash;and
in this world, the fire and faggot for all heretics! Hurrah!</p>

<p>And among the dark bands of the Sacred Clergy, walked the shrouded dead,
looking into the godly faces of the reverend men, with that fixed stare of their
leaden eyes. There was a corpse at the side of each Doctor of Divinity, a
ghastly dead man at the shoulder of each oily Priest. And they trooped on with
their black robes and their banners, and then the Ministers of justice drew nigh. A
glorious band. A figure of justice done in gilt upon a black ground, floated like
a bird of omen above their heads. By their sides walked dark-faced miscreants,
with whips and manacles in their hands; and a long line of penniless Debtors,
with starved forms and wan faces brought up the rear. Hurrah&mdash;hurrah! That
was a lusty cheer! A law-loving mob was this&mdash;&mdash;old laws and Judges, who
have an eye for their friends, they shouted, Justice with a bandage over her
eyes, so thick that gold alone can make her see clear&mdash;hurrah, hurrah!</p>

<p>Then came the slaves of the city, white and black, marching along one
mass of rags and sores and misery, huddled together; a goodly tail to the procession
of the King. Chains upon each wrist and want upon each brow. Here
they were, the slaves of the cotton Lord and the factory Prince; above their heads
a loom of iron, rising like a gibbet in the air, and by their sides the grim overseer.
Hurrah, hurrah! This is a liberal mob; it encourages manufactures.
The monopolist forever, they yelled, his enterprise gives labor to the poor,
hurrah, hurrah! The slaves lifted up their eyes at the sound of that tumultuous
hurrah, and muttered to each other, of glad green fields, and a farmer's life, and
then they clanked their chains together, and gazed at the ruins of Independence
Hall.</p>

<p>So they went trooping by the slaves of the cotton Lord, and the factory
Prince. And at their sides, and among their ranks, walked the unseen forms of
the shrouded dead. For them, the manacled and the lashed, for them the Slaves
of Capital and Trade, the grim faces of the dead wore a smile. Look up brothers,
they muttered in their awful tones, the day of your redemption draweth near!
This is the last day of your toil. The slaves heard them not, but gazing madly
upon the ruins of Independence Hall, went sadly on.</p>

<p>Suddenly a dim faint murmur burst from the ranks of the procession.</p>

<p>A murmur as faint and dim arose from the sidewalk, from the windows, and
the house-tops. Devil-Bug looked around in wonder. Every face grew suddenly
white. A strange and awful fear had descended upon the hosts of the King, and
the crowds of spectators. Rushing to the head of the procession, Devil-Bug looked
upon the face of the King. It was ashy.</p>

<p>He turned to his soldiers, he turned to his subjects, he shrieked aloud in horror.
And at that very moment ten thousand, thousand eyes beheld the object of the
Monarch's terror. At his side stood a ghastly corpse, with worms crawling round
its brow, and dull leaden eyes, animate with a horrid light, like a gleam from
hell.</p>

<!-- page 329 -->

<p>One shriek went up to God from that vast crowd&mdash;one shriek of horror. Every
eye beheld the corpse at the side of the King, and now&mdash;oh God of judgment!
Every man in all that countless crowd, beheld the form of a grim Dead Man at
his side! How the shriek of horror, rushed up at the clear sky, like thunder from
hell! Yes, yes, every man beheld the form of a corpse at his side, every woman
saw the leaden eyes gazing upon her beauty, the very babes beheld the awful
spectacle and hid their heads in their mother's bosoms, and mingled their shrill
cry of horror, with the shriek of the millions.</p>

<p>The film had fallen from their eyes! They <i>knew</i> that the Dead walked among
them. They knew that the Last Day was upon them in blackness and fear. The
Priests cast aside their banners and grovelled in the dust. They shrieked for
mercy to that God, whose name had been blasphemed by their every act and word.
With a clanking sound ten thousand muskets and swords, and spears rolled
upon the ground. The warriors too were on their knees, but they looked upon
the sky not in imbecile fear, but with a stern and awful agony. Then the shrieks
of the women, the wild yells of the crowd, the horrible anguish of old men,
tearing their grey hair in very agony! There, there, with them, and among
them, and around them, glided the forms of the Dead, with their ghastly eyes
and their long white shrouds.</p>

<p>Above the sky was clear, the sun was radiant. Azure and serene, the heavens
were undimmed by a cloud. The King looked up and folded his arms, while the
cold sweat trickled down his brow, he set his stern lips together, and muttered a
curse upon his God. At the very instant, from the clear sky leapt a bolt of red
thunder;&mdash;&mdash;the King lay on the earth a blackened corpse. Then the long line
of houses began to sink into the earth, slowly, slowly, inch by inch, like ships at
sea, with the waves creeping over their decks. Then from the earth burst streams
of vapor, hissing and whirling as they spouted upward into the blue sky. Around
each pillar of vapor, in an instant there lay a circle of blackened corpses. That
steam smote the living to the heart, it withered their eyeballs; it crisped the
flesh on their bones, like the bark peeling from the log before the flame.</p>

<p>Then from the sky so clear, so serene, leapt ten thousand bolts of red thunder,
each bolt striking the earth with a fierce hissing sound, and laying the living
along its path, a heap of blackened and a festering dead. Then the earth began
to heave, like the ocean in a storm, and waves of solid ground rose up to the clear
heavens, bearing palaces and domes, and steeples on their crests!</p>

<p>A storm on the land, waves of solid earth, billows crested with domes and steeples,
with myriads of human beings, hanging like foam on the top of each wave
and billow&mdash;huzza!</p>

<p>Columns of hot vapor rising from the heaving earth, ten thousand, thousand
columns, winding upward to the clear blue sky, with a circle of blackened dead,
thrown in one huddled mass around each hissing column&mdash;huzza, huzza! Then
the shrieks, and the groans, and the low muttered thunder, echoing from the
bosom of each earthly wave!</p>

<p>Then the fair women tossed in the air, clasping their babes in their arms, as
they were dashed in fragments on the earth, the old men and the bright-eyed
youth, all mingled together in the Massacre of judgment!</p>

<p>Devil-Bug beheld it all, and was not harmed. An invisible hand bore him on
through the heaps of bleeding dead, over the waves of tossing earth, on and on,
unscathed and without harm. He heard the crash of one wave, crested with

<!-- page 330 -->

temples meeting another, with the mass of human beings tossed from its summit
like foam-sparkles from a brooklet's ripple, he heard the cries of despair, and
over all, he beheld the smiling sky.</p>

<p>He felt himself borne suddenly aloft, on the crest of one long and tremendous
billow of solid earth! High above the ruin, high above the universe of that
city's woe, it rose, it shot upward into the sky! It remained fixed in the air, an
awful column of trembling earth, with its crumbling peak tenanted by three
living beings, besides Devil-Bug.</p>

<p>A father, and his child, and the lover of that child. The father standing on
the summit of this dizzy column, tore his grey hairs in very despair, as he beheld
the city rocking to and fro at its base. The daughter clung to his knees, her
long golden hair waving in the sunbeams, and her large blue eyes upturned to
his face. The lover with a dark eye, gazing on the sky, and jet-black hair damp
with the beaded sweat, trickling from his brow he cowered to the earth of that
fearful isle, he howled in imbecile agony! Devil-Bug looked upon the scene
with a strange pleasure. There they were, perched on the summit of that dizzy
column, that column of solid earth, thrown upward into the air, by the wave which
had tossed them aloft, there they were, alone in that world of death.</p>

<p>Below them, and around them rocked the city, its temples tossed like autumn
leaves by the wind, its uncounted myriads of human beings mingled in one awful
massacre!</p>

<p>Then the earth began to crumble from the edges of the column, and far, far
below, whirling first to one side and the other, the hard lumps of solid clay were
tossed like wounded birds upon the breeze. The father moaned and gathered
the blue-eyed girl closer to his knees, but the lover&mdash;&mdash;Devil-Bug, laughed in
glee as he beheld the dastard act!&mdash;the lover rose with a mad shriek, and seized
the maiden in his arms.</p>

<p>"Down!" he cried tossing her aloft. "There is room but for one upon this
isle&mdash;down!"</p>

<p>The old man caught him by the throat, he tore the girl from his arms, and
then battling over her prostrate form, for a foothold on that dizzy column's surface,
they grappled together, and fought like devils! The old man's eyes started
from his withered face, and the lover seized his cheek between his teeth, and
howled like a hyena rushing on a corpse! Devil-Bug beheld the scene, and yet,
by some strange influence, maintained his foothold on the rock. The old man
gathered the lover in his arms, he tossed him wildly aloft, he sprung from the
eerie isle! How their folding bodies went down through the clear air, with a
sound like the whizzing of birds upon the airy! The fair girl raised herself from
her prostrate position, she gazed over the edge of the crumbling column!
Oh God, what an awful space lay between that column's summit and the rocking
earth! She raised herself upon her feet, she tossed her golden hair upon the
wind, she looked to the blue sky with outspread arms, she leaped toward the
radiant sun with a wild shriek! "I come!" she cried. Then down to the
heaving wreck of the city, like a dove wounded by the hunter's shaft, plunging
through the still air she fell! Devil-Bug was alone upon the surface of the awful
column, alone with that utterable sight, seen far below.</p>

<p>He raised his hands aloft, he flung them in the air with a shriek of infernal
glee!</p>

<!-- page 331 -->

<p>And then right over his head, dusky and black gathered the cloud of the night
before, like the raven corpse of the dead. And in its awful surface was written
the words of flame and a ghastly voice whispered their meaning to the air,</p>

<p class="center">WO UNTO SODOM</p>

<p>Again like a spirit reigning over the evil which he had wrought, Devil-Bug
raised his hands and laughed in glee.</p>

<p>"Look below," cried the ghastly voice, speaking from the still air, "look far
below, and behold the wreck of the doomed city. Temples and domes, heaps of
dead and piles of solid earth mingled in one awful ruin! The river burdened
with blackened corpses, and the bright sky watching smilingly over all! Look
and behold the Massacre of Judgments! The Sacrifice of Justice! The wrongs
of ages are avenged at last! At last the voice of Blood crying from the very
stones of the idolatrous city, has pierced the ear of God. Look beneath, and look
upon the wreck of the Doomed City! Look below and with the angels of eternal
justice, shout the amen to the litany of the city's crimes, shout Wo,</p>

<p class="center">"WO UNTO SODOM."</p>

<p>CHAPTER FIRST.</p>

<p class="small">GOD IS JUST.</p>

</div>

<p>THE night drew near its close. From the dark azure of the sky, the cold
winter stars shone down over the streets of the silent city.</p>

<p>At that moment, when the night had yet an hour to run, when the morning
dawn was yet an hour distant, in two chambers of the slumbering town,
removed from each other by the space of a mile, were progressing scenes
fraught with a deep and solemn interest.</p>

<p>In one chamber was mystery and gloom; in the other was poverty and
death. In one chamber was priestly guilt bargaining with sorcery for the
downfall of purity and virtue; in the other, a ruined woman lay, while
starvation and suicide stood watching by her couch.</p>

<p>First, we draw the veil from the chamber of the sorcerer.</p>

It was an hour before the dawn of morning, on the night of Friday the
twenty-third of December, when two figures came walking slowly and carelessly
along one of the prominent streets, near the heart of the city.</p>

<p>A solitary lamp illumined the pavement, near the centre of a massive
block of towering mansions. For a few feet around the lamp, was thrown
a vivid and ruddy light, while all beyond and above, was shadow, starlight
and the heavy obscurity which falls upon the night, before the dawn of day.
The figures paused for a moment in the light of the lamp.</p>

<p>"Parson do you believe in a God?" said a voice rendered indistinct and
husky with wine.</p>

<p>"Why to tell you the truth Fitz, I've preached about that particular belief
frequently, quite frequently. So often, in fact, that I've forgotten what
is my especial faith on that point."</p>

<p>And with a bland smile the godly Dr. Pyne gazed upon the swarthy
countenance of Fitz-Cowles.</p>

<!-- page 334 -->

<p>"Quite drunk," he muttered to himself with a pleasant chuckle. "Has
quite a snake in his hat. A perfect viper of a snake!"</p>

<p>"Because if you do believe in a God," returned Fitz-Cowles, endeavoring
to maintain possession of a particular brick near the lamp-post, "I'd just
thank you to name him! For, Parson&mdash;hear me now, you fat old dog! I
swear by that God, to have the girl before another day goes over my head!"</p>

<p>Fitz-Cowles struck his gold-headed cane against the lamp-post, while the
Parson seemed to enjoy the scene, with a vast fund of good humor.</p>

<p>"That was very good wine we drank in the cellar? Eh, Fitz?"</p>

<p>"The devil take you and the wine. I was talking of the girl."</p>

<p>"Oh, you was, was you? And you'd like to <i>have</i> her?"</p>

<p>"Don't grin that way again, Parson, or I'll knock you down. I will <i>have</i>
her, eh? <i>have</i> her, before another sun goes over, over, my&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hat!" suggested the Parson, with a wide grin.</p>

<p>"Head, curse you, head!" roared Fitz-Cowles. "Hello! what old building
is this?"</p>

<p>Fitz-Cowles started backward toward the curb as he spoke, and placing
his conical hat on the end of his cane, took a quiet though half-drunken
survey of the building.</p>

<p>It was an old-fashioned structure, four stories in height, with a massive
hall door in the centre, and a multitude of windows on either side. The surface
was a bright yellow. This fact, by itself, was sufficient to excite the
attention of a wayfarer, for in the Quaker City, the eye is wearied by one
unvarying sameness of dull red brick. The man who paints a house blue,
or yellow or pink or white, or any other hue in fact, than this monotonous
red, is incontinently set down by his neighbors, as slightly weak-minded or
positively crazy.</p>

<p>In addition to this striking peculiarity, the house was marked by several
other characteristics, well adapted to excite the wonder of a citizen or a
stranger. The windows were numerous, but each window was small and
cramped in size, with its dingy white shutters, hermetically sealed. The
roof was flat, the cornices around the eaves massive, and the hall door approached
by a flight of time-worn marble steps. The mansion was separated
from the adjoining houses by a narrow alley on either side, whose darkness
the light of the lamp could not penetrate.</p>

<p>"That's what I call a venerable structure," exclaimed Fitz-Cowles, maintaining
his position on the curb-stone, with a gentle see-saw motion. "It
looks as though it were one of the town residences of that respectable old
gentleman, the Wandering Jew. Dammit, Parson, what's it used for?"</p>

<p>Parson Pyne smiled pleasantly as he replied in an unctuous whisper.&mdash;"The
uses of that house are three-fold, Fitz-Cowles. In the first place"&mdash;&mdash;"Curse
your first places!" You ain't in the pulpit now, old boy."</p>

<p>"It is a Mad-House," whispered Dr. Pyne.</p>

<p>"Ha!" ejaculated Fitz-Cowles with a vacant stare.</p>

<!-- page 335 -->

<p>"It is a Dissecting Hall," continued the fat Parson.</p>

<p>"A what?" cried the drunken Millionaire.</p>

<p>"And it is a Sorcerer's Den!" exclaimed Pyne with deep emphasis.</p>

<p>"Hello!" ejaculated Fitz-Cowles. "You don't say that? And who is
the Mad Doctor, the Dissector, and the Sorcerer? Is their names Smith, or
Jones, or Miller?"</p>

<p>"Did you never notice on Chestnut Street, on a sunshiny afternoon, a
slight thin individual, rather well built, but with a stoop in his gait? He
dresses in a dark cloth overcoat, rather profusely adorned with furs, and
wears his hair long and lank about his shoulders? His face is yellow as a
guinea, but he has an eye like a devil incarnate&mdash;&mdash;do you know the man?"</p>

<p>Fitz-Cowles raised his gold-headed cane slowly to his lips. At that moment
he presented a finished picture of drunken wisdom.</p>

<p>"He is called a Signior, is he not? A Signior or a Don or a Prince?"
"The same. Well, this sallow-faced gentleman in the furred dress and the
dark eyes, is the Mad-Doctor, the Dissector and the Sorcerer."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that I should like to have a little conversation with the
old boy," exclaimed Fitz-Cowles, aiming a blow at a particular brick with
the end of his cane. "Is he visible at this hour?"</p>

<p>Dr. Pyne raised his hand suddenly to his forehead. "I have it!" he
muttered between his teeth. "I must get rid of this fellow without delay.
Look ye, Fitz-Cowles," he exclaimed aloud. "We must part for the night.
By to-morrow at noon, I will place this girl in your power. There is my
hand on it! Good-night!"</p>

<p>And he strode hurriedly down the street.</p>

<p>"That's what I call <i>cool!</i>" muttered Fitz-Cowles with a drunken leer, as
he strode away from the lamp in an opposite direction. "Ha&mdash;ha!" he
chuckled to himself. "Has a sallow face and a devil's eye&mdash;ha, hee! Be
in my power&mdash;&mdash;to-morrow at noon, hurrah!"</p>

<p>In a moment the Millionaire was lost to view in the darkness, and the fat
form of Dr. Pyne emerged from a neighboring alley, and ascended the marble
steps of the old mansion.</p>

<p>He rang the bell in silence. There was a long and weary pause, and the
sound of a key turning the lock was heard. One of the panels of the massive
door receded, and a dingy black hand was thrust through the crevice.
Dr. Pyne took a small piece of green paste-board from his pocket, and after
glancing for an instant at the strange characters scrawled upon its surface,
he placed it within the grasp of the sable hand, which immediately disappeared.
There was a pause for a moment, and then the door was opened,
and a negro dressed in green livery, beckoned the Parson to enter. In an
instant Dr. Pyne stood at the end of a long and narrow hall, illumined by a
single lamp, suspended near its centre, with its farther extreme occupied by
the steps of a massive stairway.</p>

<!-- page 336 -->

<p>The negro in livery locked the door, and then folding his arms across his
breast, stood before the Parson, motionless as a statue.</p>

<p>"Is your master in?" said Dr. Pyne.</p>

<p>The negro made no reply.</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n the nigger," muttered the Parson. "He must be addressed by
his proper name, or else he will not answer. Abhar*&mdash;I would see the Signior
Ravoni?"</p>

<p class="small">[*Pronounced Aa-<i>var</i>, with the accent on the final syllable.]</p>

<p>The negro Mute waved his hand toward the stairway, and slowly led the
way along the Hall. As they passed under the lamp, Dr. Pyne started with
involuntary disgust. The full ugliness of the negro's face broke upon him
at a glance. The Mute did not observe the start, but silently led the way
up the thickly carpeted stairs, and along a dark and gloomy entry. The
negro opened the door, which turned on its hinges without the slightest approach
to a sound, and the Rev. Dr. Pyne entered the Den of the Signior
Ravoni.</p>

<p>As he stepped over the threshold the door was closed, and he was alone
with the Sorcerer. He looked around, and an involuntary feeling of awe
gathered round his heart.</p>

<p>It was a spacious chamber, lined along its firm walls with thick folds of
dark velvet. At one end the dreary uniformity of the velvet was broken by
a massive mirror, which enclosed in a glittering frame, reached half-way
from the ceiling to the floor. The ceiling was painted black, and the floor
concealed by a sable carpet, gave no echo to the footstep.</p>

<p>In front of the mirror, seated beside a table, covered with black cloth, with
the light of a small lamp falling over his sallow face and dark robes, the
Signior Ravoni sate silent and motionless, his pale white hand tracing lines
on a sheet of paper, while his head was downcast, and his long dark hair
hung carelessly about his neck and shoulders.</p>

<p>He raised his head slowly from the manuscript, and his large dark eyes
were fixed upon the face of the clergyman.</p>

<p>"Who is it that seeks audience with the Signior Ravoni?" he said in a
deep sepulchral voice.</p>

<p>There was something so calm, so dignified yet spectral and unearthly in
the manner and tone of this singular man, that Dr. Pyne was awed into
silence for a few moments. At last shaking off the feeling of superstitious
fear which began to creep over him, he advanced and laid the green card
upon the table.</p>

<p>"This was given to me by Doctor &mdash;&mdash;" he said, naming a celebrated
Surgeon of the Quaker City. "He is one of your friends and pupils. He
informed me that you were skilled in the treatment of the Insane."</p>

"You seek the advice of the Signior Ravoni?" interrupted the voice of the
Signior.</p>

<p>"I have a daughter&mdash;" began Dr. Pyne. Ravoni motioned him to a seat,

<!-- page 337 -->

and then resting his sullen cheek upon his pale hand, he fixed the glance of
his large dark eyes upon the face of the priest, and listened in silence to his
story.</p>

<p>Their interview continued for the space of half an hour, when the Parson
took the pen from the table, and wrote a few lines on a slip of paper.</p>

<p>"This will settle the matter," he cried with one of his Satyr-like smiles.
"Arrange this business and the money is <i>yours!</i>"</p>

<p>A gleam of contempt flashed from the dark eyes of Ravoni.</p>

<p>"It shall be done," he said as he rose from his seat.</p>

<p>The door was flung suddenly open and a loud laugh burst upon the air.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, Doctor! I've come to steal that corpse for you," shouted a
rough voice, "I've come to steal the dead body&mdash;hurray!"</p>

<p>Well was it for Dr. Pyne that he sank behind the table, as the sound of
that voice broke on his ear!</p>

<p>For in the centre of the chamber, stood Devil-Bug the doorkeeper of
Monk-Hall, every line of his distorted countenance, quivering with a wild
expression akin to madness, while his solitary eye dilated and flashed like
phosphorus gleaming through the orbless socket of a skull.</p>

<p>"I've had <i>sich</i> dreams," he shouted, dashing the thick hair aside from his
protuberant brow. "Sich dreams o' death an' hell, that I could murder a
man jest now, for the wery fun o' th' thing!</p>

<p>"Did yo' say I was to steal a dead body to-night, Doctor? By * * * I
could steal a graveyard of 'em!"</p>

<p>The expressive lip of Ravoni curled in scorn.</p>

<p>"Is the day drunk or crazy," he muttered, with that slight foreign accent
which marked his speech. "Slave!" he cried advancing with his arm outstretched,
"How dare you cross that threshold unbidden?"</p>

<p>His sallow face grew animate with contemptuous indignation. Every
muscle of his countenance quivered; his lip trembled with scorn; his eyebrows
were joined in a withering form.</p>

<p>A strange magnetic gleam darted from his eyes. He waved his white
hand in the air with a gesture of command.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug endeavored to brave that look, but in vain! There was a fearful
magnetic power in the glance of those large dark eyes. He felt himself
drawn toward them. He felt the control of his limbs, the mastery of his
immense strength passing from him like a dream.</p>

<p>"To your knees," whispered the deep tones of Ravoni. "To your knees,
dog! Am I not your&mdash;&mdash;<i>master?</i>"</p>

<p>The glance of those eyes was upon the monster. Impelled by an unknown
influence, which darted from their unutterable lustre, Devil-Bug walked
tremblingly along the floor, and crouched at the feet of Ravoni like a spaniel
at the call of his master. And there clinging by each hand to the feet of
Ravoni, he still fixed his gaze upon the lustre of the full dark eyes which
held him prisoner. And this, when one single blow of his iron hand, might

<!-- page 338 -->

have crushed the man who stood before him into a shapeless mass of clay!
It was a sublime spectacle. The triumph of an Intellect, over the Brute and
the Savage!</p>

<p>As Devil-Bug crouched spaniel-like at the feet of the Signior Ravoni, Dr.
Pyne stole from his hiding place, and slunk away from the room.</p>

<p>"Brave me thus but once again," whispered Ravoni, gazing steadily upon
the monster at his feet, "and I will take from you the power to think or act
without my consent. My will shall be yours. Your brute strength shall
be mine. Yes, yes," he added in a muttered whisper, "by one fixed exertion
of my brain, I can make my Will, the Soul of this mass of savage
strength."</p>

<p>"Master," whined Devil-Bug, still crouching on the floor, "Do with me
what you like! Ask me to steal dead bodies or set fire to a house, or murder
a man in broad day&mdash;an' I'll do it."</p>

<p>Ravoni smiled and motioned Devil-Bug to rise.</p>

<p>Our way now leads to the chamber of want and suicide.</p>

<p>We return to the nameless man whom we left, sleeping on the wayside
stones in front of the widow Smolby's house.</p>

<p>It was an hour previous to the scene which we will shortly depict.</p>

<p>Two watchmen enveloped in thick white overcoats were taking their quiet
way along the deserted street. Their conversation was fraught with that
deep and absorbing interest peculiar to the conversations of sleepy watchmen.</p>

<p>"I say Smeldyke, wots yer opin'on o' th' Tariff?" said the watchman in
a fur cap. "Don't yo' think it's the cause of half the robberies a-goin'?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about that Worlyput," responded the other guardian of the
night, whose distinguishing characteristic was an extremely picturesque relic
of a hat. "It seems to me there hain't been nothin' like comfort since the
Nasshunal Bank was destroyed. Everything's gone wrong since then.
Why you may believe it not, but the wery day the news came in that the
Deposits was removed, my wife makes me a present of a pair o' boys. Now
that never happened to us afore, and bein' a poor man with six growin' children
it wasn't a bit funny."</p>

<p>"What had the Nasshunal Bank to do with that?" responded the Fur
Cap. "I tell you Smeldyke it's the Tariff wot makes all the mischief. Was
not the Tariff the cause o' th' Florida war, where them Seminole injuns set
fire to the Bahamey Banks?"</p>

<p>"Pooh! Don't talk to me! I tell you it's the removal o' the 'Nited States
Bank!"</p>

<p>"Don't Pooh me," responded Smeldyke. "I wasn't made to be
'poohed' by a man like you. There now. An' wot have you got to say to
that?"</p>

<p>Doubling his fists, Smeldyke advanced toward his comrade Guardian with
a manner full of menace. Worlyput squared his elbows, and returned his

<!-- page 339 -->

brother guardian's look of fierce defiance. There was every prospect of a
fierce encounter between those respectable functionaries, when their attention
was attracted by a deep groan, proceeding from the centre of the street.</p>

<p>In silence they advanced to the side of the prostrate man, as he lay with
his limbs flung carelessly over the rough stones of the street. His face was
pressed against the earth, and his long dark hair was soiled with the dust
and mire of the gutter.</p>

<p>"Come feller, wake up! You're a purty one to be layin' here in this
state," exclaimed Smeldyke, raising the strange man on his feet.</p>

<p>"Yes, you're a purty feller, you are!" chimed in Worlyput. "In these days
o' Washin'tonian rewivals, when they makes Congressmen out o' drunkards,
and the worse drunkards they've been, the better Congressmen they makes!
You're a beauty I vow!"</p>

<p>With these amiable words on his lips, the intelligent Smeldyke dealt the
unconscious man a vigorous punch in the sides, and Worlyput paid a similar
compliment to his breast and shoulders.</p>

<p>"What 'ave you got to say for yourself? eh?"</p>

<p>"Mary, I will save you, save you yet!" exclaimed the stranger, opening
his eyes, and gazing wildly around. The last beams of the setting moon
fell upon the discolored face of Byrnewood Arlington!</p>

<p>"Mary there is death in my path, but I will save you!" he shouted,
springing from the grasp of the watchmen. "I will save you yet!" And
with a speed that defied pursuit, he darted down the street, dashing his arms
wildly overhead, and shouting madly as he was lost to view in the shadows
of the street.</p>

<p>"Mary!" the name was borne upon the winter wind.</p>

<p>"Well, if that ain't cool!" ejaculated Smeldyke.</p>

<p>"I suspect Mary's his wife&mdash;the young scamp! Been ill-treatin' her, has
he? I say Smel, my boy, wots your idea of the 'Nited States Bank?"</p>

<p>Shouting the name of his sister to the still night, his senses whirling in
mad confusion, and an awful consciousness of calamity pressing upon his
heart like a dead man's hand upon the breast of the living, the Brother fled
along the deserted street, his flashing eyes upturned to the starlight sky,
while his long black hair streamed wildly on the winter wind.</p>

<p>He knew not why he fled, but there was madness in his veins and fire in
his heart. Invisible hands seemed leading him onward. Had some fathomless
chasm yawned at his feet, he would have plunged into its darkness with
a frenzied joy. The very stars of night had a voice for him. A low-toned
and whispering chaunt filled the vault of heaven, and its burden was full of
omen and woe.</p>

<p>Thus madly, with his hands grasping at phantoms, he fled along the silent
streets; while time and space were lost and forgotten in his delirium.</p>

<p>It was after the space of half an hour, when standing motionless as stone,

<!-- page 340 -->

at the corner of a wide street, his hands solemnly upraised to the sky, and
a wild oath trembling on his lips, it was at this moment when his dark eyes
blazed with frenzy, that the spell passed from him, and he stood like a man
aroused from a dream. He looked around in vague wonder. The effect of
the Potion was gone! And with it had passed all memory of the fearful incidents
of the last forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>He stood there, beneath the gleam of the starlit sky, and his reason was
with him, but when he tried to remember an incident or even a thought of
the moment previous, all was shadow and dream.</p>

<p>This was indeed the peculiar curse of the Potion administered by Devil-Bug.
It destroyed the memory. There are men who can never call to
mind the incidents of a sight of intoxication. With these men wine is oblivion.
So with the drugged potion; it might stupefy a man; it might arouse him
into frenzy; he might murder his best friend while under its influence, but
that influence once over, he was as unconscious of the past as the dead are
of the living.</p>

<p>"I have had a horrible dream!" muttered Byrnewood, folding his arms
and stalking slowly along the pavement. "Ah! I see how it is. I have
been indulging in wine! Fool that I am! To steep my soul in madness!
Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I remember, I was with Lorrimer. We drank freely. I became
crazy from the effects of the wine, left my company, and here I am, wandering
about the streets, like an escaped lunatic. I vow I've lost my hat&mdash;" he
raised his hand to his head, "And my hair is matted and tangled. Pshaw!
What a miserable fool I have been making of myself!"</p>

<p>He ground his teeth together with mortification and remorse.</p>

<p>"It was indeed a horrible dream! Mary dishonored&mdash;yes, yes, and let me
remember? Who did I dream was her seducer? Was it Lorrimer? It has all
escaped my memory, but it was a fearful dream. Thank God it was a dream!"</p>

<p>He clasped his hands in silent joy.</p>

<p>"Thank God, it was a dream!"</p>

<p>A wild sound, like the cry of a strong man in mortal agony, broke on the
still night air. Byrnewood listened and looked around. He stood in front
of a row of massive buildings, dwellings and warehouses, with a small frame
house, arising near the centre of the square, like an image of starvation in
the midst of plenty.</p>

<p>Again that low moaning sound startled the still air.</p>

<p>The door of the frame house was flung suddenly open, and the figure of
a woman rushed out upon the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"Help! Help!" she cried in the shrill tones of age. "There is murder
in this house! Help! Help!"</p>

<p>She perceived Byrnewood, and rushed forward, and clung wildly to his arm.</p>

<p>"For God's sake stranger," she cried as her white hair escaping from
beneath her torn cap, streamed down to her shoulders. "For God's sake
stranger, this way!"</p>

<!-- page 341 -->

<p>And ere he could reply she hurried into the house, clinging nervously to
his arm while she urged him onward. They passed through a dark room,
and in an instant stood at the foot of a narrow stairway, at the head of which,
a light was streaming from an open door.</p>

<p>"Quick, quick, or we'll be too late," screamed the old woman, as she led
the way up stairs, her tongue and her feet clattering to one brisk tune. "You
see, I'm a poor widow, and about six months ago, I let out the upper part
of my house to poor Davis. He was a carpenter, and no doubt meant to do
well, but troubles came thick upon him, he could not get any work, and about
a month ago his wife died. Come in, Sir, or we'll be too late! Oh, my
God, sich a thing in my house! And then Sir, some rascal&mdash;I wish I had
the villain here&mdash;ruined his poor daughter, and so to-night, poor Davis went
out and&mdash;oh my God, my God!"</p>

<p>They stood at the stairway, and the light from the room flashed full in
their faces. Byrnewood glanced within the room, and felt his blood grow cold.</p>

<p>In that chamber Starvation and Suicide watched by the death-bed of
Innocence.</p>

<p>Ere Byrnewood enters the place of death, we must travel back some hours
in our story.</p>

<p>Our Episode will furnish to the world a pleasing illustration of that Justice,
which in the Quaker City, unbars the jail to Great Swindlers, while it sends
the honest Poor Man into the grave of the Suicide.</p>

<p>The State House clock had just struck eight, when amid the gay crowds
who thronged Chestnut Street, might be discerned one poor wan-faced man,
who strode sadly up and down the pavement in front of a jeweller's window.
The night was bitter cold, but a tattered round-about and patched trowsers,
constituted his scanty apparel. He had not been shaven for several days,
and a thick beard, gave a wild appearance to his lank jaws and compressed
lips. His face was pale as a mort-cloth, but his eye shone with that clear wild
light that once seen, can never be forgotten. There was Famine in the unnatural
gleam of that eye. His much-worn hat was thrown back from his
pale forehead, and there, in the lines of that frowning brow you might read
the full volume of wrong and want, which the oppressors of this world write
on the faces of the poor.</p>

<p>Up and down the cold pavement he strode. He looked from side to side
for a glance of pity. There was no humanity in the eyes that met his gaze.
Fashionable Dames going to the Opera, Merchants in broadcloth returning
from the counting-house, Bank Directors hurrying to their homes, godly
preachers wending to their Churches, their faces full of sobriety and their
hearts burning with enmity to the Pope of Rome: These all were there, on
that crowded pavement. But pity for the Poor man, who with Famine written
on his forehead and blazing from his eyes, strode up and down, in front
of the Jeweller's gaudy window? Not one solitary throb!</p>

<!-- page 342 -->

<p>"No bread, no fire," muttered the Mechanic as he looked to the sky with
a dark scowl on his brow. "No bread, no fire for two whole days. I can
bear it, but&mdash;&mdash;God! My child, my child!"</p>

<p>With the tattered cuff of his coat sleeve he wiped away a salt tear from
his cheek.</p>

<p>"God!" he fiercely muttered between his set teeth. "Is there a God?
Is he just? Then why have these people fine clothes and warm homes, when
<i>I, I</i>, with honest hands, have no bread to eat, no fire to warm me?"</p>

<p>Your pardon, pious people, your pardon for the blasphemy of this starving
wretch! Starvation you know is a grim sceptic, a very Infidel, a doubter
and a scoffer!</p>

<p>"Two days without bread or fire!" he muttered and strode wearily along
the street. Suddenly a half-muttered cry of delight escaped from his lips.
A splendid carriage, drawn by two blood horses, with a coat of arms gleaming
on its panels, met his gaze. It was the work of an instant for the Mechanic
to spring up behind this carriage, while a smiling-faced elderly gentleman,
sate alone by himself within. And away the horses dashed, until
they reached a large mansion in one of the most aristocratic squares of the
city. The smiling-faced elderly gentleman came out of the carriage, and
after telling James the coachman, to be very careful of the horses, he took
his night-key from his pocket, and entered the mansion.</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> failed three days ago," said the Mechanic, glancing at the mansion
with a grim smile, as he leapt down from the coach. "The Bank of which
he is President broke a fortnight since! Ha, ha!"</p>

<p>And with a hollow laugh he pointed to the retreating coach and then to
the mansion, from whose curtained windows the blaze of lights flashed out
upon the street.</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> is the President of the Bank that broke, and yet has his coach and
horses, his house, his servants and his wines. I had six hundred dollars in
that Bank, and yet have not a crust of bread to eat. I s'pose this must be
what they call <i>justice!</i>"</p>

<p>And with that same mocking laugh he strode up the marble steps of the
Bank President's Palace.</p>

<p>"I will make another effort," he whispered. "And if that fails&mdash;&mdash;Ha!
God will take care of my child. As for myself&mdash;ha! ha! I s'pose the
over-seers of the Poor will bury me!"</p>

<p>The door of the Bank President's Palace was ajar. The Mechanic pushed
it open and entered. A ruddy glow of light streamed through the parlor
doorway into the hall. Walking boldly forward, the Mechanic paused at
the door and looked in. Oh, such fine furniture, a splendid glass above the
mantel, ottomans, a sofa, a gorgeous carpet, and silk curtains drooping along
from the windows&mdash;magnificent furniture!</p>

<p>"And <i>he</i> is the President of the Broken Bank."</p>

<p>Mr. Job Joneson, the President of the Bank which had just failed for only

<!-- page 343 -->

one million dollars, sate writing at a table in the centre of that gorgeous parlor.
He was a pleasant man, with a round face and small eyes, a short
neck and a white cravat, corpulent paunch and a showy broadcloth coat.
Altogether Job Joneson, Esq. was one of your good citizens, who subscribe
large sums to tract societies, and sport velvet-cushioned pews in church. He
did not perceive the entrance of the Mechanic, but having taken his seat in
a hurry, was making some memoranda in his notebook by the light of
the astral lamp.</p>

<p>"Twenty dollars to the Society for promoting Bible Christianity at Rome,"
thus he soliloquized. "Good idea, that. Be in all the Patent-Gospel papers.
Two hundred dollars for jewelry; Mrs. Joneson <i>is</i> very extravagant. Fifty
dollars for furniture broken by my son Robert who is now at College. Bad
boy that! One thousand dollars for a piano, <i>grand</i> piano for my daughter
Corinne&mdash;&mdash;Ha! Hum! Who's there? What do you want?"</p>

<p>The Mechanic advanced, and taking off his hat, approached the table. It
was a fine contrast; the unshaven Mechanic, and the Bank President; on
this side of the table rags and want, on that side, broadcloth and plenty;
here a face with Famine written on its every line; there a visage redolent
of venison steaks and turtle soup.</p>

<p>"Your business Sir?"</p>

<p>"Do you not know me, Mr. Joneson? I am John Davis."</p>

<p>"Indeed! You shingled a house for me last summer. Why you are
sadly changed!"</p>

<p>The lip of the Mechanic trembled.</p>

<p>"I was a little better-looking last summer, I believe," he said, "But Mr.
Joneson, I have called upon you in order to ascertain, whether there is any
hope of my ever getting any portion of my money from the * * * * *
Bank?"</p>

<p>"Not one cent!" said the Bank President, taking out his watch and playing
with the seals.</p>

<p>"I worked very hard for that money, Mr. Joneson. I've frozen in the
winter's chill, and broiled in the summer's heat for that money, Mr. Joneson."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, you talk to me as if I could help it," said Mr. Joneson,
gazing intently upon the motto engraven on his seal, '<i>Up with the Bible</i>.'</p>

<p>"And now Mr. Joneson, I am without work; my money is gone." continued
John Davis, speaking in a low tone that God's angels could not listen
to without tears, "My child lays at the point of death.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How can I help <i>that</i>, my good fellow? I am sorry that your child is
sick&mdash;but can I help it?" said the Bank President in the tone of withering
politeness.</p>

<p>"I have neither bread nor medicine to give her," said Davis as his grey
eye blazed with a strange light. "There has been no fire in her room for
two days&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get work," said the Bank President, in a short decided tone.</p>

<!-- page 344 -->

<p>"<i>Where?</i>" And Davis extended his lean hands, while a quiet look of
despair stamped every line of his countenance.</p>

<p>"Anywhere! Everywhere! You don't mean to say that an able-bodied
man like you can't get work in this enlightened city of Philadelphia? Pshaw!"</p>

<p>"I have tried to get work for two long weeks, and am now without a crust
of bread!" And John gazed steadily in Joneson's face.</p>

<p>"Well then, where's your credit? You don't mean to say that an industrious
mechanic like you are, or ought to be, can't obtain credit in this enterprising
city of Philadelphia?"</p>

<p>"There is no imprisonment for debt," said John with a sickly smile.
"No poor man gets 'trust' now-a-days."</p>

<p>"Well my poor fellow I am sorry for you, sorry that our Bank failed to
meet its liabilities, sorry that you invested your little money in it, very sorry!
But d'ye see? I have an engagement, and must go."</p>

<p>The corpulent Bank President rose from his seat, inserted his watch in its
fob, put on his great coat, and moved toward the door.</p>

<p>Davis stood as if rooted to that gorgeous carpet. He made an effort to
speak but his tongue produced but a hollow sound. Then his lip trembled,
and his quivering fingers were pressed nervously against his breast.</p>

<p>"Come my fellow, I pity your case, but I can't help it. There is a meeting
of the Patent-Gospel Association to-night, and I must go. You see my
fellow, the Pope of Rome must be put down, and I must go an' help do it."</p>

<p>Davis advanced toward the corpulent Bank President.</p>

<p>"Look here Mr. Joneson," he said in that husky whisper, which speaks
from the thin lips of want. "My hands are hardened to bone by work.
Look at these fingers. D'ye see how cramped and crooked they are? Well,
Mr. Joneson, for six long years have I slaved for that six hundred dollars.
And why? Because I wanted to give my wife a home in our old age, because
I wished to give some schoolin' to my child. This money Mr. Joneson,
I placed in your hands last summer. You said you'd invest it in stock,
and now, <i>now</i>, Sir, my wife has been dead a month, my child lies on her
dyin' bed without bread to eat, or a drop of medicine to still a single death-pain.
An' I come to you, and ask you for my money, an' you tell me that
<i>the Bank is broke!</i> Now Mr. Joneson, what I want to ask you is this&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice trembled, and he raised his hands to his eyes for a single instant.</p>

<p>"Will you lend me some money to buy some wood and some bread?"</p>

<p>"Why Davis, really you are too hard for me," said the round-faced Joneson,
moving a step nearer to the threshold. There was a supercilious curl
about his fat lip, and a sleepy contempt about his leaden eyes.</p>

<p>"Will you," cried Davis, his voice rising into a whispered shriek, "Will
you lend me <i>one</i> dollar?"</p>

<p>"Davis, Davis, you're too hard for me," said the Bank President, jingling
the silver in his pocket with his gouty hands. "The fact is, were I to listen
to all such appeals to my feelings, I would be a beggar to-morrow&mdash;"</p>

<p>He strode quickly over the threshold as he spoke.</p>

<!-- page 345 -->

<p>"John," he cried to the servant who was passing through the hall, "If
anybody calls for me, you can say that I have gone to the special meeting
of the American Patent-Gospel Association. And look ye John, tell James
to have the coach ready by twelve to-night: one of the Directors gives a
party, and I must be there; and when <i>this person</i> goes out, you can put
down the dead-latch."</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, the Bank President walked quietly to the front door
of the mansion, and in a moment was passing along the crowded street.
John Davis stood in the centre of that gorgeous parlor, silent and motionless
as a figure carved out of solid rock.</p>

<p>"Come <i>Mister</i>, as the gentleman's gone, I s'pose you may as well tortle!"
said a harsh voice. John Davis looked up, and beheld a fat-faced servant
in livery, motioning him toward the front door.</p>

<p>Without picking his hat from the carpet, John walked slowly from the
house.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Job Joneson, Esq. passing with a dignified waddle through the
crowded street, reached the corner of Sixth and Chestnut Streets, where the
outline of the State House arose into the clear, cold, star-lit sky.</p>

<p>A hand was laid gently on his shoulder. Joneson turning quickly round,
beheld a man of some thirty years, whose slovenly dress and red nose betrayed
his profession. He was a tip-staff of one of the Courts of <i>Justice</i>.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, Sir, your name Joneson Sir? There is a case to be tried
in Court to-morrow, and you are summoned to appear as a witness. Here's
the Subp&oelig;na&mdash;"</p>

<p>Joneson reached forth his hand to grasp the paper, when the figure of John
Davis strode quietly between him and the tip-staff.</p>

<p>"And <i>I</i>," shrieked a voice, wild and broken, yet horrible in its slightest
tones, "And <i>I</i> have a summons for you, also!" The Bank President made
an involuntary start as the glare of those maniac eyes flashed upon him. "I
subp&oelig;na you, <i>you</i> Job Joneson, to appear at the Bar of Almighty God before
daybreak to-morrow!"</p>

<p>And he raised one thin hand to Heaven while the other rested upon the
Bank President's shoulder. Joneson shrunk from that touch&mdash;it was like
hot lead on the bare skin!</p>

<p>"I will be <i>there!</i>" whispered Davis. "<i>There!</i>" And he waved his
thin hands towards the stars. "At the Bar of God Almighty before daybreak
to-morrow!"</p>

<p>The Bank President raised his hands to his eyes with an involuntary gesture.
When he again looked around, the maniac was gone.</p>

<p>We will leave Job Joneson Esq., until the hour of daybreak on the morning
of Friday the twenty-third of December.</p>

<p>Byrnewood Arlington stood on the threshold of the Poor Man's Chamber.
The first object that met his eyes was the body of a man flung over two

<!-- page 346 -->

chairs, with the arms dropping heavily to the floor, and the long thin fingers
touching the uncarpeted boards. A miserable candle half burnt to its socket,
and fixed in an old bottle, was placed upon a table rough pine. The flickering
light fell over the face of the man. It was pale and livid, the lips hung
apart, and the lower jaw was sunken. Byrnewood advanced and looked,
and again that cold chill ran through his veins. There was a gash across
the throat of the man, and his dingy shirt was spotted with curdled blood.</p>

<p>Byrnewood started as if to avoid the sight, when a low faint cry burst
upon his ears. It was the cry of a child.</p>

<p>"You see," said the old woman pointing to a cradle in a dark corner of
the room&mdash;"The child was born, about three weeks since, and I took care
of it, while the mother was sick. Little did I know that the poor girl wanted
for bread! And she a mother too!"</p>

<p>"The mother?" muttered Byrnewood as his expressive face manifested a
strange agitation. "Where is she?"</p>

<p>"There behind you," answered the old woman.</p>

<p>Byrnewood suddenly turned round, and beheld a white sheet thrown over
a miserable bed in one corner of the room. Beneath the folds of the sheet
the outlines of a human form were perceptible. It looked like a statue of a
beautiful woman, covered with a thin drapery that but half concealed it from
the view. The arms lay motionless along the bed, and the feet were thrust
upward, causing a slight elevation in the folds of the sheet.</p>

<p>Byrnewood advanced to the bedside. His face was ashy, and the sweat
hung in thick beads upon his forehead.</p>

<p>"An' the night afore last," cried the old woman as he advanced&mdash;"Sick
as she was, poor thing! She went out in the street to try and find <i>him</i>, the
villain who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A deep groan heaving from Byrnewood's chest, made the old woman
start with a strange fear.</p>

<p>Byrnewood advanced slowly, he knelt by the bed of death. The sheet
concealed the face of the dead girl. Byrnewood reached forth his hand&mdash;the
white fingers trembled like leaves in the wind.</p>

<p>He lifted the sheet and looked upon the face of the dead. One look was
enough. With a wild howl he fell backward, and for a moment lay like a
dead man on the floor. A low groan came from his lips. Then with a
sudden bound he sprang to his feet&mdash;his dark eyes were rivetted to the face
of the dead. Again that wild cry burst from his heaving chest; his hands
were pressed madly against his forehead. He fled from the room and from
the house, as though hell was yawning at his back.</p>

<p>The old woman stood stricken dumb with astonishment. It was some
minutes before she could recover her presence of mind.</p>

<p>"Oh my God, my God!" she cried. "What's the use of so much

<!-- page 347 -->

misery in the world! What good does it do? oh, Lor' what am I sayin'?
An' she so young an' beautiful&mdash;oh Lor', oh, Lor'!"</p>

<p>"And how is our young patient?" said a soft and whispering voice.</p>

<p>The old dame turned round with a start. The Signior Ravoni stood
before her, his slight form clad in a long robe or surtout of dark cloth,
adorned with fur along the edges, and around the neck. The sleeves hung
wide and loose, their dark fur borders, imparting a marble whiteness to the
delicate hands of the Signior. A diamond pin of dazzling lustre, confined
the plain black cravat which encircled his throat, while his black hair, long
and lank, was surmounted by a circular cap of dark fur. His sallow face
wore a calm and insinuating smile, as his dark eyes were fixed upon the
countenance of the old dame with a clear impenetrable glance, that sent a
shudder through every fibre of her withered frame.</p>

<p>"And how is our young patient?"</p>

<p>"Dead, oh my God, <i>dead!</i>" shrieked the old woman pointing towards
the couch.</p>

<p>"Dead!" cried the Signior with a start. "And this sight," he whispered
as his glance rested upon the form of the suicide,&mdash;"What does it mean?"</p>

<p>"Why you see Doctor Raven, when I went to see you the t'other day,
and begged you to come and wisit a poor girl as was sick an' had no
friends&mdash;for I'd heered you was kind and charitable tho' a forriner&mdash;I didn't
know how poor Davis was, and my God!&mdash;All the time you're been comin'
here&mdash;<i>unknown</i> to Davis d'ye mind? For he was poor, but proud and
couldn't bear to think of havin' a Doctor 'tend on his child for <i>mere charity</i>.
And so&mdash;what was I a-sayin'? Oh, why all this time Davis, has been
waitin' for bread, and so to-night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cut his throat in despair? And this in the pious Quaker City?" And
a withering smile played around the expressive lips of the Signior. "Cut
his throat because he had no bread to give his child? Can such things happen
in pious and <i>Protestant</i> Philadelphia?"</p>

<p>"Oh my God," cried the old woman bursting into tears, "If I live
a-hundred years more, I'll never forget the look which she gave me to-night,
when she was dyin', and her words! "Missus Wilson," says she with the
tears in her big blue eyes, "that crust of rye bread on the table yonder, is
all that I've had to eat for twelve long hours. She was too proud to speak
of it, until she was dyin'!"</p>

<p>"There was a noble soul locked in that lifeless form!" muttered Ravoni,
"And the medicine which I gave you last night?"</p>

<p>"I mixed it with some gruel, which I made for her, and she drank it, but
it wasn't of any use! She died an hour afterwards."</p>

<p>"She died an hour afterwards!" echoed Ravoni, with a meaning smile.</p>

<p>"She died in my arms only half an hour ago," chimed in the old dame,
"An' there but five minutes ago as I was straightenin' her out on the bed,
her father poor John Davis comes in, looks for an instant on the face of his

<!-- page 348 -->

child, and then&mdash;oh Lor', oh Lor'&mdash;he cuts his throat from ear to ear, and
falls on two cheers as dead as a stone!"</p>

<p>"He is yet warm," muttered Ravoni laying his hand on the dead man's
face. "There is an awful Despair written in the face of that ghastly corse!
And so she died an hour after taking the medicine?"</p>

<p>"And sich a purty corse!" cried Mrs. Wilson, "Jist look there! Did
ever ye see sich hair? So curly and long, and so like gold. Did you ever
see sich a mouth?"</p>

<p>She lifted the sheet, and Ravoni gazed upon the countenance of the lifeless
girl. Death was there in beauty. Long curling locks of golden hair,
fell twining around a mild and winning countenance, with arching eyebrows,
lips that smiled even in death, and a round chin, still indented with a laughing
dimple. The neck was snow-white, and as the sheet was lifted slowly
up, a gleam of light shone upon a fair young bosom&mdash;dainty food for
the grave-worms!</p>

<p>Death was upon the face and the bosom in holy beauty. The veins still
traced their azure lines upon the alabaster of those rounded globes; a rose-bud
spot of red still bloomed upon each swelling cheek.</p>

<p>Ravoni folded his arms and gazed upon the corse in speechless silence.
His meaning eyes dilated and flashed with a peculiar expression, and his thin
lips trembled with an emotion as strange as the gleam of his eyes.</p>

<p>"Widow you are poor, but you have been kind to this man and his child,"
he said in a calm dignified whisper. "Here is money for the funeral of this
poor Suicide. I myself will attend to the burial of the girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Widow was about to reply, when a confused sound like the trampling
of feet over the pavement below, attracted their attention. Then came the
sound of a door flung suddenly open, and then a voice resounded from the
foot of the stairway.</p>

<p>"Hallo! Is there anybody in this house?" it cried in thick gruff tones.
"It's the watchman," muttered the widow, going to the head of the stairs&mdash;"Is
that you, Mister Thompson?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is widow," replied the gruff voice, "but here's a man taken sick
in his carriage comin' home from a party, and he wants help mighty bad&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You see Master made a little too free with the wine at Deacon Rogers'
house," chimed in another voice. "An' consequence is, he's took bad
with an appylectic fit&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then the sound of footsteps was heard on the stairs, and in a few
moments the back of the watchman's great coat appeared in the doorway,
with the fat face of a man in livery, peering over his shoulder. Between
them, was the body of the sick man. He groaned and struggled as they
laid him on the floor, and turned his head from side to side, as though the
death rattle was in his throat.</p>

<p>As his head turned from side to side, the light fell upon the round fat face
of Job Joneson, the Bank President!</p>

<!-- page 349 -->

<p>"Well," screamed the man in livery, "If there ain't the man I turned
from Master's door last night&mdash;if there he ain't with his throat cut!"</p>

<p>The Watchman looked upon the Suicide with a start, and muttered distinctly
to himself the words, "<i>dam&mdash;fool</i>." Watchmen are great
philosophers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the centre of the uncarpeted floor, his dark broadcloth coat
soiled by the white foam which fell from his lips, his round face turned from
glowing red to dark purple, with the distorted veins standing out from his
skin, lay Job Joneson, the Bank President, moving piteously as he clutched
the breast of his shirt with his gouty fingers. His eyes red and bloodshot,
protruded from his face, and rolled from side to side with a pitiful stare.</p>

<p>"Can't you do nothin' for him nobody?" said the Man in Livery. "He's
my master!"</p>

<p>"I am afraid all is over," said Ravoni stooping down over the prostrate
Bank President. "However we may bleed him&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words had scarcely passed his lips when Joneson rose on his knees
with a violent struggle.</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;where&mdash;" he muttered as a gurgling noise sounded in his
throat&mdash;"Where&mdash;am&mdash;I&mdash;ah!" His voice rose into a horrible shriek
husky with the death rattle. He beheld the ghastly face of the Suicide.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;a-h!" he groaned clutching at his throat with his gouty hands.
"<i>At the Bar of God Almighty before daybreak to-morrow!</i>"</p>

<p>With these words on his lips, he fell&mdash;a shapeless mass of clay. He had
obeyed the subp&oelig;na of the Suicide; he had gone to meet his pale Accuser
before the Throne of Eternity.</p>

<p>God is just.</p>

<p>This is a truth we often hear preached, but it falls upon our ears with a
hollow sound.</p>

<p>God is just.</p>

<p>Come hither, all the world, come to the chamber of Want and Suicide,
and gaze upon this picture of God's Justice.</p>

<p>On the floor, the bare and uncarpeted floor, lay the portly form of the
Bank President, beside the very chairs which supported the lean figure of
the Suicide. The face of the Bank President was loathsome purple; and
his bloodshot eyes hung from their sockets; the visage of the Suicide ashy
pale, and there was a red gash across his throat.</p>

<p>The legalized Robber lay beside the wretch whom he had plundered. The
well-fed Bank President who not ten hours past, had refused the starving
Mechanic one solitary dollar, now lay beside the victim of his lawful fraud,
like that victim, a loathsome mass of clay, on which worms would soon hold
their revel.</p>

<p>Say, was not this the justice of God?</p>

<p>And the trembling light fell over the forms of the two dead men, the Summoner
and the Summoned, and upon the figures of the strange group who

<!-- page 350 -->

encircled them. There was the Signior Ravoni, his sallow face wearing
that meaning smile, his eyes flashing their calm impenetrable glance, while
with folded arms he gazed upon the dead. The old widow, and the phlegmatic
watchman, and the well-fed servant, all stood by gazing upon the scene
with one common awe.</p>

<p>And behind the group was the bed of death, with the cold white sheet
thrown over the icy form of the ruined girl.</p>

<p>The good and merciful God has flung between our eyes and the shadow
of Eternity an awful veil, or else we might follow up to Judgment, the soul
of the Bank President. We might behold the long train of orphan's ghosts
who follow his soul with curses to the bar of Almighty justice, and there
while the pale Suicide stalks before him, blasting his sight with a spectacle
of speechless woe, we might see how the guilty wretch trembles and crouches
in the presence of his God, as the wrongs of ten thousand men and women
and children beggared by his fraud, come blackening upward, in palpable
shapes of doom.</p>

<p>But let him pass to his account. There are hundreds like him, walking
the streets of the Quaker City, their round fat faces wearing a pleasant smile
as they think of houses and lands, torn from the honest poor by legalized
robbery. Let them all pass&mdash;God is just</p>

<p>The Watchman and the Man in Livery bore the dead man to his carriage.</p>

<p>"How cussed heavy the old chap is," muttered the Watchman, as he
tumbled the mass of clay through the carriage door.</p>

<p>"Wonder who in the d&mdash;l 'ill pay me my wages?" cried the Man in
Livery, jumping up behind the coach.</p>

<p>The coachman, who had been sleeping on his box, woke up from his quiet
nap and asked a brief question.&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say John, is it a common fit, or has the old man kicked the bucket?"</p>

<p>"Kicked the bucket, James!"</p>

<p>"No!" replied the other in a tone of complacent wonder. "Cussed glad
he paid me off, yesterday. W-h-oop!"</p>

<p>He applied the whip to the blood horses and away they dashed, bearing
to his home, his wife and children, the dead body of the Bank President.</p>

<p>As the carriage drove away from the door, and disappeared in the distance,
another vehicle came slowly along the street and halted in front of the widow's
house. It was drawn by one horse, and was by no means as gorgeous in
appearance as the coach of the Bank President. There was no gaudy coat
of arms emblazoned on its panels, nor did the coachman wear a livery of
showy hues garnished with bright tinsel. It was a hearse, and the driver
who dismounted from the box, was dressed in black, with thick folds of crape
drooping over his face.</p>

<!-- page 351 -->

<p>"It's near daybreak," he muttered in a hoarse voice. "It's near daybreak
and I must be in a hurry. Werry fine coffin that!"</p>

<p>He pointed to the glittering coffin which the uplifted folds of the hearse
exposed to view, and then disappeared into the house of the widow.</p>

<p>Ravoni and the old woman stood beside the bed of death.</p>

<p>"I will attend to the burial of the girl," said Ravoni, placing gold in the
hands of the woman.</p>

<p>As he spoke the figure of a man, with crape drooping over his face glided
between the twain, and extending his rude hands, gathered the sheet around
the form of the dead girl.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" cried the old woman with a haggard look. "I
don't 'xactly know what to make of it?"</p>

<p>The man with the crape hung round his face, silently placed the body of
the girl upon his shoulder, and while Ravoni confronted the old woman, strode
quietly toward the doorway.</p>

<p>"What does it mean? Why d'ye take the body from this house?" said
the old woman in the shrill peevish tones, that old women are wont to use,
when slightly angered.</p>

<p>"Woman do you think I could harm the dead?" said Ravoni, and he bent
the glance of his unfathomable eyes upon the withered face of the woman.</p>

<p>There was something awful in the magic of that man's look.</p>

<p>The arms of the old woman fell by her side, and she stood like a statue,
yet with her grey eyes chained to the glance of Ravoni.</p>

<p>What was the power of this man? In the dark ages they would have
called it Magic; in the Nineteenth century, they call it Magnetism.</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied?" said the Signior with a mild and insinuating smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," gasped the old woman. "Only leave me&mdash;That's all."</p>

<p>The man with the corpse on his shoulder thrust aside the crape from his
face. The grim visage of Devil-Bug was revealed by the beams of the
trembling light.</p>

<p>"Curse the man," he muttered. "I b'lieve he's a born devil! I don't
feel as tho' I had a will of my own any more. I don't like the way things
work!"</p>

<p>He strode down stairs with these muttered words on his lips. As the
corpse of the Mother disappeared, the Babe sleeping in the cradle awoke and
uttered a faint cry.</p>

<p>"Here is gold for the child," said Ravoni, and then folding his arms
calmly together strode from the house.</p>

<p>The rattling of the hearse, as it dashed along the deserted street broke on
his ears.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, I must prepare for the scene of <i>to-morrow</i>," he muttered. "Now
for my home, now for the <i>Orgy of Ravoni</i>."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, and raised his hands to the daybreak sky.</p>

<!-- page 352 -->

<p>"Ye stars, beneath whose light I have walked two hundred years, tell me,
shall I not live until my name is worshipped as a God among these playthings
of an intellect like mine, these men who plot and plan and gather
gold, and yet creep into the same dull grave at last?"</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br/>

<p>CHAPTER SECOND.</p>

<p class="small">THE CURSE OF THE DRUGGED POTION.</p>

</div>

<p>THE day was breaking in the east, when a pale man came trembling up
the marble steps of a mansion in South Third Street, and leaning against
the stone pillars of the door, buried his face in his hands, while every fibre
of his frame, shook with emotion.</p>

<p>The day was breaking, and red gleams of morning shot up into the sky,
cold white clouds, sailing slowly through the heavens, caught the first kiss
of sunrise on their bosoms.</p>

<p>The man who leaned for support against the heavy door pillars, raised
his face from his hands, after a moment of silent agony, and tossing his dark
hair aside from his brow, looked fixedly at the vacant air, with set teeth and
flashing eyes.</p>

<p>"It is all fancy, I know it, I know it! And yet there, there, floating in
the dim air, I see her form,&mdash;oh! how cold and icy! The death-shroud
waves round her stiffened limbs&mdash;the taint of corruption is on her cheek.&mdash;Her
eyes&mdash;so dead, so lustreless&mdash;have still a gleam that burns into my
soul. And I am her Murderer! Yes, yes, her <i>Murderer!</i> Her babe will
live to curse my name. In her last hour she called on me&mdash;she shrieked
my name with her last breath!"</p>

<p>He pressed his hot eyeballs against his hands, and was silent again. A
terrible remorse had seized upon the soul of Byrnewood Arlington.</p>

<p>In that hour the poor drudge, the despised Servant Girl was forgotten.</p>

<p>The wronged woman, holy because trusting, innocent because loving with
a pure love, that flung the world of her honor at her lover's feet, the
wronged woman glided like a phantom between the seducer and the light.</p>

<p>A noble soul throbbed within the bosom of Byrnewood Arlington. In
crushing the honor of an unprotected girl, he had only followed out the law
which the Lady and Gentleman of Christian Society recognize with tacit
reverence. Seduce a <i>rich</i> maiden? Wrong the daughter of a <i>good</i> family?
Oh, this is horrible; it is a crime only paralleled in enormity by the blasphemy
of God's name. But a poor girl, a <i>servant</i>, a domestic? Oh, no! These
are fair game for the gentleman of fashionable society; upon the wrongs of
such as these the fine lady looks with a light laugh and supercilious smile.
Now it was that the better soul of Byrnewood awoke within and plead

<!-- page 353 -->

for the woman he had wronged. Could his life, at that moment have restored
her to life and purity, he would have flung it on her grave with joy.</p>

<p>He stood at his father's door again. In the strange oblivion of soul which
succeeded the drugged potion, he fancied that only a night had passed since
he left his father's threshold.</p>

<p>The key was in the lock; he turned it, and after the lapse of a moment,
stood in the dark entry and closed the door at his back.</p>

<p>He advanced along the hall, while an awful presentiment flashed over his
soul. Dim memories of the scenes in Monk-Hall rushed upon him.</p>

<p>"I will seek my sister's room," he muttered. "If she is there, then all
is right, and these presentiments are but folly."</p>

<p>He was passing by the parlor door, when the sound of voices talking in
low tones, arrested his attention. Gently opening the door, he started back
in surprise, as a blaze of light rushed out upon the darkness of the hall. He
entered the parlor with a softened footstep, and looked around in vague wonder.
The astral lamp stood lighted on the centre-table, and the remains of
a coal fire mouldered in the grate.</p>

<p>Two figures were seated upon the sofa, an old man and an elderly dame.
They sat with their hands clasped on their knees, and their eyes fixed
vacantly upon the carpet. So deep was their reverie, that they did not look
up, or manifest any knowledge of the intruder's presence.</p>

<p>Byrnewood stood chained to the spot, by a silent horror. Scarce might
he recognize his father, in the care worn old man, who sat silent and
withered before him; scarce might he know his mother in the hollow-eyed
old woman, whose dark hair, slightly silvered by age, fell carelessly over
her shoulders.</p>

<p>He advanced a step, and beheld that his mother's dark eyes were red with
weeping; his father's lips trembled with an incessant movement.</p>

<p>They looked like people who have been watching long days and weary
nights by the sick-bed of some loved one, without once changing their apparel
or taking an hour's repose.</p>

<p>Byrnewood advanced another step; they beheld him, and started to their
feet with a half-muttered cry. Oh, there was a volume of Hope and Fear
and Agony in that involuntary shriek!</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence. The father and mother gazed in the
face of their son, with the same look full of horrible suspense. Byrnewood
returned that look, and the three stood like statues of some unspeakable
Agony.</p>

<p>"<i>Mary</i>"&mdash;gasped the Father, and then all further words died on his
tongue. He stood with his hands extended and his lips trembling as with
a spasm.</p>

<p>"Mary!" echoed Byrnewood. "Father there is some dark mystery here.
Is she sick? Or&mdash;or&mdash;" and his lips grew white&mdash;"Or it may be that she
is&mdash;<i>dead!</i> Keep me no longer in suspense; tell me the worst at once."</p>

<!-- page 354 -->

<p>"Know you not Byrnewood that your sister has been missing since the
night before last?" slowly asked the old Merchant.</p>

<p>"The night before last!" echoed Byrnewood. "Surely father that cannot
be. Last night when I left home, she was in your arms&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Last night?" echoed Mrs. Arlington in vague astonishment.</p>

<p>"Why Byrnewood you have been absent from home for the last thirty-six
hours" exclaimed the Merchant sharing the wonder of his wife.</p>

<p>Byrnewood made no reply, but tottering to the sofa, he buried his face in
his hands, and was silent for a single moment. With all the force of his
Soul concentrated on one point, he endeavored to remember the events of the
last thirty-six hours.</p>

<p>"Did I ever think of this!" cried the Father clasping his hands wildly
together. "Did I ever think of this, when I toiled day after day over the
desk, laboring like a slave at the galley, to build up a fortune which my
children might enjoy, when I was dead and gone! Did I ever think that
Mary&mdash;Mary for whom I have toiled and toiled for years&mdash;should be torn
from me in this way? My God! This suspense is tenfold more horrible
than death!"</p>

<p>"Don't you remember her light laugh as she sprang over that threshold
two nights ago&mdash;'I'll be back, I'll be back to-morrow!' "</p>

<p>The mother paused and burst into tears. There are some things which
can be written down in language, but not a Mother's Love, nor a Mother's
Fear. What was Mrs. Arlington thirty-six hours ago? A blooming matron
with a healthy cheek, and a dark eye, speaking affection and tenderness.
What is she <i>now?</i> An old woman, with a withered cheek and a hollow
eye-socket, a brain fired by a thousand mingling emotions, and a heart cankered
by the gnawings of care. A mother's Love, does not manifest its
tenderness in words, but in the gleam of the eye, or the smile of the lip; a
Mother's Fear is written down in the wrinkled brow, the faded cheek, the
eye darting unnatural light and the lip quivering with a tremulous motion,
that speaks the helplessness of the agony, that is eating into the Soul.</p>

<p>"Father&mdash;mother," cried Byrnewood starting from his seat. "There is
a strange mystery pressing on my brain! I am either the victim of an awful
delusion, or else there is in store for me, for you, for us all, a Reality
worse than death! Even while I speak to you, there are passing before me,
shapes and forms and visions, whose mystery I dare not&mdash;oh dare not&mdash;speak
to you! You know father that I love Mary, that I always loved her.
You know that I would give my life for her. Trust the mystery of this
matter, with me! A few hours will bring her back to this threshold in
safety and honor, or confirm these horrible suspicions which are working
through my brain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yet stay, Byrnewood," cried Mr. Arlington as his son moved toward
the door. "Where have you been during the last thirty-six hours, where&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ask me not, ask me not!" shouted Byrnewood with a start and look

<!-- page 355 -->

full of frenzy. "Ask me not for the sake of Mary, ask me not! In a few
hours I will return to you&mdash;then you shall know all!"</p>

<p>With these words he rushed from the room. The old Merchant gazed in
the face of his wife, who returned the intensity of his look in silence. Not a
word was spoken, not a single cry of anguish broke from the lips of father
or mother. They suffered in silence. They <i>endured</i>, while every tone of
their lost daughter was ringing in their ears, while every look of her beaming
face, treasured by memory, came back to haunt them like a Ghost sent
from the bosom of the past, they endured and suffered in silence.</p>

<p>And yet in all the bitterness of their anguish not one thought came across
their souls of Mary's <i>dishonor</i>. She might have been the victim of some
terrible accident, she might have lost her way in the crowded city, to whose
maze of streets she was a stranger, she might be dead and buried and without
the knowledge of father or mother; but that the voice of Wrong had
lured her from her home, that her virgin soul had been stained by <i>dishonor?</i>
The thought never crossed their souls. God in his mercy, may have withheld
this horrible thought from the brimming cup of their agony. It was
terror enough for them to know that their child was gone; but that she was
dishonored! Better than to tell them this, would it have been to pour
molten lead on their quivering eyeballs!</p>

<p>Byrnewood rushed hurriedly up the stairway of the mansion and in a few
moments entered his bedchamber. The morning dawn broke through the
curtains that hung along the windows. How his heart rose to his throat as
he crossed the threshold! Thirty-six hours ago he had left that chamber a
free-hearted and joyous man; now he came back with an awful mystery
pressing on his soul.</p>

<p>Advancing toward a dressing bureau, which stood between two lofty windows,
Byrnewood opened a drawer, near the top, and took from thence a
small casket.</p>

<p>This casket he opened and placing some object, which it contained within
the folds of his vest, he knelt down on the floor, and raised his hands
to heaven.</p>

<p>His face was ghastly pale. His eyes were not upraised, but they glared
steadily forward, with a wild and watery stare. As he knelt you might
see the muscles of his clenched hand writhe like serpents, and his white lips
moved but uttered no sound.</p>

<p>The first red gleam of the morning sun fell on his pale forehead. Still
his lips moved with that soundless motion, and the muscles of his hand still
writhed beneath the skin.</p>

<p>It was thus for a moment. He then arose on his feet, and assuming
another hat and cloak in the place of those which he had lost at Monk-Hall,
he went slowly down the stairs and from the house.</p>

<p>It was now sunrise on the morning of Friday the twenty-third of
December.</p>

<p><i>On</i> CHRISTMAS EVE <i>at the hour of</i> SUNSET, <i>one of ye will die by the
other's hand. The winding sheet is woven and the coffin made.</i></p>

<p>The Prophecy rushed over the soul of Byrnewood, as he left his father's
threshold. Where he had heard it, by whom it had been spoken, or who
was the other person included in its wild denunciation&mdash;all was shadow and
mystery to Byrnewood Arlington.</p>

<p>"To-morrow night is Christmas Eve," he muttered as the winter sunbeams
broke over his brow, and then passed from the shadow of his
father's door.</p>

<p>Into that door again, he did not return until the hour before Sunset on
Saturday the twenty-fourth of December; the hour of Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>CHAPTER THIRD.</p>

<p class="small">"RAVONI A GOD!"</p>

</div>

<p>THE gleam of a vivid light illumined the Audience Chamber of Ravoni.</p>

<p>Beside the table, in the centre of that room, with its walls and floor and
its ceiling of one gloomy blackness, stood a man of impressive look and
manner, whose entire appearance was in strange contrast with the place.</p>

<p>His figure slight yet beautifully proportioned was clad in a costume, like
that worn by the Chevaliers of France in the palmy days that went before
the night of the Revolution. He wore a coat of lustrous dark satin, with
wide skirts and sleeves hanging in easy folds around the waist. Around the
collar and along the front, it was adorned with rich embroidery of gold lace,
and in place of buttons, a line of diamonds, flung back the reflection of the
light with a gleam like stars shining in a clear lake. His vest was of snowy
whiteness; his hose of dark hues, displayed the shape of his elegantly
moulded limbs; and his red-heeled shoes,* glittered with diamond buckles.
His shirt bosom was of transparent whiteness, and his small white hands
were relieved by the thick folds of the ruffles that fell back from his wrist.</p>

<p class="small">[*'The red-heeled shoe' was worn by the French nobility previous to the Revolution.]</p>

<p>Altogether he presented a fine specimen in his appearance and costume
of one of those gorgeous gentlemen, whose presence gave life and wit to the
circle of courtiers, who in the olden time clustered around the gay Kings
of France.</p>

<p>His head and face were singularly beautiful. His complexion was a rich
olive with a flush of deep vermilion warming the centre of each cheek. His
eyebrows were dark and arching, his nose a delicate aquiline with slight

<!-- page 357 -->

nostrils that quivered in scorn and dilated in anger; his mouth was small
and expressive with lips of the most voluptuous ruby. The upper lip curled
with a proud scorn, while the lower projected slightly, with an expression
of refined voluptuousness. His chin was small, round and decided; and
altogether, though somewhat large in proportion to the size of his body, his
face was at once thoughtful in its every outline and delicate in every feature.
His brow wide, massive and deathly pale, was well relieved by thick masses
of dark hair, which fell twining in ringlets to his shoulders.</p>

<p>And from beneath the shadow of that pale brow, gleamed evermore the
clear light of two dark eyes, whose gaze sent a strange thrill of awe into the
souls of men. It was not the excessive brightness of these eyes that attracted
your attention, nor their intense blackness, nor the delicate fringe of the long
and quivering eyelashes. There was a strange magnetic power in their
glance; their look was a spell; their anger an awful fascination that left the
gazer powerless; their love an irresistible influence that dragged the victim
to shame and ruin with a smile. That terrible consciousness of soul, which
men in their poverty of words, call THE WILL, gleamed calmly and fixedly
from those wizard eyes.</p>

<p>And this gayly dressed Chevalier, standing alone in the Audience Chamber,
this strange man with the striking face and the shadowy eyes&mdash;who was
he?</p>

<p>It was the Signior Ravoni.</p>

<p>*"Yes, yes, I am myself once more," he muttered, striding slowly along
the room. "The sallow hues of care have vanished from my cheeks; the stoop
of age has fallen from my shoulders. Once more I stand attired for the Festival
of Ravoni! That Festival I have celebrated beside the waters of the Ganges,
in the fragrant air of Ceylon, amid the snows of the polar desert, and
in the boundless deserts where moulder the palaces of Montezuma!</p>

<p>"Two hundred years&mdash;&mdash;a glorious career! Once an idle Courtier of a
thoughtless king, a <i>Chevalier</i> whose very breath hung suspended on a Monarch's
will&mdash;<i>now</i> I am a soul, an Intellect, a deathless Power! What playthings
are these men of science! In all ages and in every clime the same!
When they have won a little knowledge, they stoop from their proud height
to gather gold, in the gutter of a human and contemptible rivalry. I gathered
knowledge, I won science from the earth, the air, the sea, from the very sky
above me, but how glorious the object for which that knowledge was acquired!</p>

<p>"What have I won? A deathless career among things whose life is death!</p>

<p>"Even now my soul leaps from scene to scene of that memory which
written in books men would call History!</p>

<!-- page 358 -->

<p>"When the torch of St. Bartholomew flashed through the streets of Paris&mdash;I
was there! When the pikes of the Revolution glittered around the scaffold
of a doomed King, and a pale-faced Priest bade the Son of St. Louis ascend
to heaven; I was there!</p>

<p>"The proud Corsican, stood on the height of the Egyptian pyramid, and
surveyed his hosts, scattered far and wide beneath, at once his warriors and
his worshippers, while his bronzed brow lit up with a deathless ambition, and
his lip curled in scorn as he gave to the air the thought of his soul, "When
all the world is mine, then I will build up a religion of whose altars I shall
be the God!" As these words fell from his lips, I, I the <i>Savan</i> Ravoni stood
by his side.</p>

<p>"Where is the Corsican now? Where is Ravoni?</p>

<p>"And in that old Hall, where Fifty-Six stern hearted citizens gave the law
to a world, down-trodden by tyrants, there, there I stood, while the pens
whose very ink was Destiny, were tracing the immortal Signatures upon the
scroll, which is now Eternal!</p>

<p>"I stood there, and saw their faces' fire as the last name was written.</p>

<p>"Where are the Signers now? In the dust!</p>

<p>"Where is Ravoni? Still on his deathless career!</p>

<p>"I stood by the side of Washington, when he took the Oath as President
of this New World, which was then the Hope of all mankind.</p>

<p>"Where is Washington now? And where is La Fayette and Adams and
Jefferson and Hamilton?</p>

<p>"Ask the dust of annihilation to give back its dead?</p>

<p>"And what is that New World which they fondly hoped would become
the Ararat on which the Ark of a World's Salvation was to find a rest at last?</p>

<p>"Go to her Senate Halls, and find bullies and braggarts wearing the robes
once worn by men, who were gods in soul!</p>

<p>"A pitiful craven lurks in the Chair, where Washington once sate, the
wonder of a world. Treason blasphemes the place once sanctified by Honor!*</p>

<p class="small">[*The reader will remember that the Era of this story is the year 1842.]</p>

<p>"Bribery sits on the judicial bench, and a licentious mob administers justice
with the Knife and the Torch. In the Pulpit crouches grim superstition
preaching a God, whose mercy is one Incarnate Threat, whose beneficence
is written on the Grave stone of a wrecked world!</p>

<p>"Such is the Land of Freedom for which Washington fought and La Fayette
bled!</p>

<p>"And where is Ravoni now? Still on his deathless career!</p>

<p>"Such as Ravoni have lived in all ages, in every clime! Bold Intellects
who wrested from corruption the secret of undying energy. And these
Intellects so various in their powers, so various in their wierd histories,
common Tradition has combined in one form, and called a thousand mighty
Souls, by one paltry name, the Wandering Jew! Superstition must baptize
a giant Truth in the waters of puerile fiction! Few of these great Intellects

<!-- page 359 -->

survive at the present day. Some have grown tired of the sameness of their
being, and rushed into annihilation through the grim portals of Suicide. But
few survive&mdash;Among these, lives Ravoni!</p>

<p>"And if this great earth must one day sink into chaos, when the gleam
of her last sun illumines the summit of the last solitary mountain, reeling
to its foundations, it will also the brow of Ravoni!</p>

<p>"I will build me up a Religion!</p>

<p>"There is no God. There is no Heaven. There is no Hell. At least,
the belief of the million, with regard to mysteries like these, is all shadow
and fable.</p>

<p>"I believe in a God, but my God is the Power of a Giant Will. In a
Heaven, but it is that Heaven which springs from the refined cultivation of
all the senses. In a Hell I believe&mdash;it is the hell of Annihilation.</p>

<p>"The million, led on by the herd of Priests and Drones, have seized upon
these Truths of the olden Sages, and made Realities of these Fables, by
which Thought spoke to the souls of men, in the ancient times.</p>

<p>"I will build me up a Religion. A thousand years hence looking from
the brow of some tremendous mountain, I shall behold the plains below
whitened by the marble domes of a mild and beneficent religion; those domes
shall tower in the name of a God, in the name of Ravoni!</p>

<p>"The rock on which all Religions have been wrecked, shall not endanger
the Faith of Ravoni. Its Founder will not die! He will not like Mahommed
build up a Beautiful System, and then sink into the grave, leaving his
temple to the ravages of priestly liars and robbers.</p>

<p>"The Faith of Ravoni will be simple and beautiful. War shall be buried.
Anarchy forever dethroned; all Treason against the Life of man, shall be
eternally crushed. Men shall live, love and die in their peaceful beds.
Priestcraft shall be no more!</p>

<p>"I will teach men that in the Refined cultivation of the Senses is Happiness.
Not a pore on the body but may be made the Minister of some new
Joy; not a throb in the veins, but may become a living Pleasure. Every
outrage committed against the refinement of the Senses brings its own punishment.
When Mirth sinks into Drunken Revelry man is a brute. When
Love sinks into coarse Lust man is a brute and devil.</p>

<p>"In order to acquire an influence over the minds of men, which shall be
irresistible and eternal, I will appeal to a principle roofed deep in every
human heart. I will evoke the love of Mystery! I will awe and terrify by
Miracles and Pageants and Shadows!</p>

<p>"At noonday to-morrow they will behold the First Miracle.</p>

<p>"Now for the Festival of Ravoni!"</p>

<p>The eloquent Blasphemer passed through a small door, concealed beneath
the hangings as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Now for the Festival of Ravoni, where the Senses hold their revel, and
Thought is softened and mellowed in the delirious atmosphere of Passion."</p>

<p>CHAPTER FOURTH.</p>

<p class="small">THE PRIESTESS OF RAVONI.</p>

</div>

<p>IN the course of one hour occurred three prominent Incidents of our
Revelation.</p>

<p>The State House clock struck nine, and the carriage of the Merchant
Prince stood waiting in front of his door. The coachman in grey livery,
turned up with black velvet, sat on the box, and the footman attired in like
costume, stood beside the carriage door which was flung wide open. The
burnished harness of the dark bay horses glittered in the sunbeams, and the
panels of the coach emblazoned with the Merchant's coat of arms, shone like
mirrors in the light.</p>

<p>It was nine o'clock, and from the front door of the mansion, the merchant
and his wife came forth. Attired in a splendid travelling habit of dark green
cloth, which developed each queenly outline of her form, Dora hung lightly
on her husband's arm, while her eyes shone with unusual lustre, and her
cheeks glowed with the hues of the damask rose. As she stepped gently
down the marble steps she was peerlessly beautiful. Every look, each gesture
and grace of her faultless limbs and imposing countenance, bespoke the
Queen, whose throne was in the hearts of all beholders.</p>

<p>It was observable that as the Merchant led his wife toward the carriage,
his face half-buried in the shadow of a fur travelling cap, was turned away
from hers, and once or twice as her gloved hand touched his arm, he shrunk
with a slight but involuntary start, as if there had been pollution in the
contact.</p>

<p>Their eyes met as they stood before the carriage door. The merchant's
face was almost hidden from the sight, by his fur cap, and the upraised
collar of his great coat, but his blue eyes dilated to an unnatural size, gazed
in the beaming face of his wife, with a cold impenetrable look that sent a
strange awe to her inmost heart.</p>

<p>"The day is beautiful Albert," said Dora with one of her winning smiles.</p>

<p>"It is indeed beautiful!" replied Livingston as his lips parted, not with a
smile, but with a spasmodic contraction of the muscles of his face. "We
have seen many such beautiful days, Dora; may we live to see many more!"</p>

<p>There was a singular gleam in his large blue eyes, as he spoke. "Have
you invited our friends to meet us at Hawkewood?" asked Dora, as she entered
the carriage.</p>

<p>"Trust me Dora, we shall have a pleasant company at the good old
place," said Livingstone in a tone of affected lightness. "By-the-bye my
dear, you will have to travel on alone, for an hour or so. I have some
business to transact, which will detain me a short time in town. I will join
you on horseback in an hour."</p>

<!-- page 361 -->

<p>Without waiting for her reply, he softly closed the door, and waved his
hand to the coachman. The carriage whirled away over the echoing stones
of the street, and Livingstone stood alone in front of his mansion.</p>

<p>"Let me see, let me see," he muttered pressing his hand against his
forehead, "What Author is it, that tells the story of an English Lord, who
world-worn and heart-sick used to amuse his leisure hours by rehearsing
his own funeral? Ha, ha! There is scarcely twenty-four hours of life
left to me, and yet I while them away in digging my grave, and another
grave beside my own!"</p>

<p>That cold spasm, which mocked a smile, played round the Merchant's
lips, and he went slowly up Fourth Street, in the direction of his Warehouse.</p>

<p>The State House clock struck nine, and two little men were walking up
and down the broad walk of Independence Square. All around them, arose
the giant trees, whose massive trunks had been young sixty years ago, when
the Proclamation of Independence rang from the steps of the ancient Hall.
Their leafless limbs shot upward into the cold blue sky, and between their
intricate branches, the white clouds might be seen, sailing slowly through
the winter heavens. At one end of the walk was Walnut Street, with a line
of splendid buildings towering in the place of the old gaol; at the other,
through the vista formed by opposing lines of trees, was seen the ancient
State House, with its steeple rising into the full glow of the sunshine.</p>

<p>And up and down this walk, paced two little men, engaged in an interesting
conversation, as might be seen from their linked arms and rapid gestures.
One little man wore a high hat and frock coat, which was buttoned so
tightly around his thick body, that it gave you the idea of a mammoth Dutch
pudding, stuffed and crammed until the skin was ready to burst. Beneath
the skirts of this frock coat appeared a pair of legs which once seen might
never be forgotten. With a thick piece of cord reaching from one calf to
another, they would have described the letter <b>A</b>; they rubbed together at the
knees, and were separated by the space of a foot between the boots. Bury
a man eighty years in a coal mine, and show him those legs after he is
brought out into the light again, and show them to him, apart from the pudding
body, and if he had ever seen them before, he would know them on first
sight. Who could ever forget Buzby Poodle's legs?</p>

<p>The other little man was dressed in a grey overcoat and a shiny leather
cap. That pale, square, Dresden-wax-doll-face would have been known
among a thousand. Who could mistake the large oyster-colored eyes of
Sylvester J. Petriken?</p>

<p>And there, they walked, the editor of the Daily Black Mail, and the Magazine
proprietor. Poodle's face reminded you of a grimacing ape, making
mouths at a magpie; Petriken's was the visage of a solemn old baboon,
wrapt in deep thought. The one fattened on the garbage of the town; the
other lived on stolen literature. One was a Scandal-monger, a Bravo on a

<!-- page 362 -->

small scale: the other a plagiarist; a very Jew, who lived by clipping the
coin of the wide realm of Intellect. There they walked, the one living on
the Murder, Suicide and Bloodshed of the town, the other thriving on the
fruits of various adroit literary robberies; there they walked arm in arm,
alike the boon companions of blackguards, and the loathing of all honest
men; these Courtezans of the Press. Poodle was the Pander of the whole
town; anybody could buy him, body and soul, for three dollars, a bottle of
wine, a Bologna sausage and a few crackers; Petriken was the hireling of
but one Libertine, Gustavus Lorrimer, and his price varied from a two dollar
subscription to his Magazine, up to the value of a second-hand steel engraving.</p>

<p>"And so you see we'll have a great Magazine!" exclaimed Petriken with
one of his sickly smiles. "To-morrow morning all the Intellects of the land
meet at my office in order to talk the matter over. I, Sylvester J. Petriken
will become the Focus of American Literature."</p>

<p>"Won't the name of Buzby Poodle be known all over the country? Posterity
shall reverence the name of Poodle, and millions yet unborn, will write
on their hearts. Isn't there somethin' in that? The name of Poodle in
scribed on the pillar of Immortality, alongside the name of Shakspeare!
And then the name of Petriken!"</p>

<p>"Let us mingle our names together!" cried little Sylvester striking an
attitude. "We will go down to posterity as Petriken <i>and</i> Poodle!"</p>

<p>"The <i>Petriken</i> and <i>the</i> Poodle! Huzza! A sort of Siamese-twinship of
genius! <i>Ensemble de chose</i>&mdash;decidedly the cheese&mdash;as we say in Domestic
French!"</p>

<p>The little men then shook hands, and stood erect, like proud representatives
of the Out-cast Literature of the Quaker City.</p>

<p>Suddenly Petriken started.</p>

<p>"I vow there's Lorrimer and Mutchins!" he exclaimed, looking toward
the State House; and ere a moment had flown, the magnificent Gus stood by
his side with the round-faced Mutchins hanging on his arm.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, Pet my boy, how d'ye do!" cried Lorrimer as a gleam of laughter
broke over his manly visage. "Silly who is <i>this</i> fellow?" he continued
arranging his moustache as he glanced at the Black Mail man with somewhat
of a supercilious smile. "Who is the gentleman in the big hat and
duck legs?"</p>

<p>"He, he, he, you're quite jocular this morning!" exclaimed the little editor
who had heard this aside speech. "Why, I'm Poodle Sir, Buzby Poodle
of the&mdash;&mdash;the Daily Black Mail!" And the little fellow advanced with a spring.</p>

<p>"Oh you <i>are</i> Buzby Poodle?" exclaimed Lorrimer with a glance from his
half-shut eyes. "Come on Petriken, come on Mutchins; I've something to
say to you. And so <i>that</i> is Poodle of the Black Mail; is it? Jove! He
looks for all the world, like a monkey dressed up to dance on the top of a
street organ!"</p>

<!-- page 363 -->

<p>And taking the arm of each gentleman within his own, he strode down the
broad walk, leaving Poodle to his own delightful meditations.</p>

<p>"Well," muttered Buzby, "w-e-ll if I don't cut that fellow up some day
my name ain't Poodle! And as for that Petriken&mdash;&mdash;damme I'll go right
to the office and abuse his Western Hem. People that insult Buzby Poodle
must look for a Poodle's vengeance. I'm a perfect Injin; I am!"</p>

<p>"Boys I've a capital joke for you," exclaimed Lorrimer, as they hurried
along the broad walk. "You see Mutchins, ha, ha! It's capital, capital!
And d'ye hear, Pet&mdash;&mdash;by Jove man!" he cried, starting suddenly. "You
are as white as a cloth in the face!"</p>

<p>Petriken stood transfixed to the spot by some unknown horror.</p>

<p>Not a word escaped his lips, but standing motionless as one of the trees
along the walk, he pointed with his outstretched hand towards Walnut Street.</p>

<p>"Look! Look!" cried Mutchins, pointing in the same direction. "There's
a sight for you Lorrimer!"</p>

<p>Lorrimer looked toward Walnut Street, and at the same moment, a cold
shudder darted through his frame. He was dumb with astonishment. Could
he believe his eyes? Yes, yes, there, there before him, advancing slowly
and leisurely along the walk, was the form of Byrnewood Arlington! Byrnewood
Arlington whom he left the night before in the hands of Devil-Bug,
whom he never dreamt to behold among living men again! Lorrimer's
expressive face grew pale, and, red by turns; for a moment he gasped for
breath.</p>

<p>"Leave the matter to me," he muttered to his companions, who stood
silent, "and mark ye&mdash;<i>deny everything</i>, d'ye hear?"</p>

<p>He had scarcely time to whisper these words to his frightened panders,
when Byrnewood approached. Lorrimer started as he beheld the wild light
gleaming from his dark eyes.</p>

<p>"I have a few words to say to you, Sir," Byrnewood begun in a low
deep tone like a voice from a sepulchre.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Sir!" cried Lorrimer with a haughty inclination of
his head, "You have the advantage of me. I do not know you Sir!" And
his face was wreathed in a polite and insinuating smile.</p>

<p>"Not know me!" echoed Byrnewood. "Was I not in your company last
night?"</p>

<p>"Decidedly not!" And Lorrimer dropped the arms of his minions, and
placed the head of his gold-mounted cane to his lips in an easy, devil-may-care
manner, characteristic of a Chestnut Street Lounger.</p>

<p>"Why Sir, Mr. Petriken here, introduced me to you; and the introduction
look place at this gentleman's rooms." He pointed to the red-faced Mutchins
as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Pet did you ever introduce this gentleman to me?" exclaimed Lorrimer
with a meaning look.</p>

<p>"Nev-er!" faltered the white-faced pander.</p>

<!-- page 364 -->

<p>"And damme Sir, I never saw you in all my life Sir," blustered Mutchins,
buttoning the front of his white coat in a pompous manner.</p>

<p>Byrnewood placed his hand to his forehead for a single instant.</p>

<p>"I remember the introduction;" he said in a slow deliberate tone, "I remember
being in the streets with you; and beyond that all is darkness!"</p>

<p>"Depend upon it, Sir," exclaimed Lorrimer, laying his hand pleasantly on
Byrnewood's shoulder, "You are the victim of some strange delusion. I
give you my solemn word of honor that I never saw you in my life before!"</p>

<p>"And your name is Lorrimer?"</p>

<p>"Egad! you've hit it! By-the-bye my dear fellow, isn't that a bald
eagle sailing among the clouds yonder?"</p>

<p>With an air of languid nonchalance he pointed upward with his cane.</p>

<p>"Will you give me your word of honor, that you never saw <i>my sister?</i>"
exclaimed Byrnewood as the Images of Memory darted over his brain.</p>

<p>"<i>Your</i> sister!" echoed Lorrimer with a vacant stare. "Oh, ho! My
dear fellow you're too hard for me! Upon my honor I never saw your sister,
nor any member of your family, to know them by name. Your name is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Arlington," responded the Brother with a steady look, "Byrnewood
Arlington."</p>

<p>"Have heard the name, but never knew any member of the family.
By Jove! That <i>must</i> be a bald eagle yonder!"</p>

<p>Byrnewood advanced a step nearer, and looked silently into the dark
hazel eyes of Lorrimer.</p>

<p>"Now for the last trial!" he muttered, and then repeated in a slow and
solemn voice the words of the prophecy.</p>

<p>" '<i>On Christmas Eve at the hour of sunset one of you will die by the
other's hand. The winding sheet is woven and the coffin made</i>.' Tell
me sir," he added in a voice full of emotion. "Did you never hear these
words before?"</p>

<p>Lorrimer's cheek did not blench, nor his eye quail. He raised his cane
languidly to his lips, and then replied in a careless tone&mdash;</p>

<p>"Never! Yet stay&mdash;I think I've read them somewhere in Dickens
or Bulwer."</p>

<p>"Oh madness! madness!" muttered Byrnewood pressing his hand forcibly
against his forehead. "I am indeed the victim of some dark delusion.
Excuse me, gentlemen for this intrusion," he continued in a tremulous
voice. "It is all a dream, a horrible dream!"</p>

<p>With these words he darted down the walk, his head bent on his bosom
and his eyes fixed upon the ground.</p>

<p>"Well, Lorrimer that was neatly done!" cried Silly Petriken, approaching
the Master-Libertine who stood in the centre of the walk, gazing upon
the retreating form of Byrnewood.</p>

<p>"You did him brown," laughed Mutchins. "But boys we must be careful&mdash;there's
a devil of a stir made about this baby-face!"</p>

<!-- page 365 -->

<p>Lorrimer made no reply. A strange glow brightened over his face, and
his hazel eyes gazed sternly on the vacant air.</p>

<p>"I say Lorrimer," began Petriken, but a fierce scowl on the brow of the
Libertine silenced him.</p>

<p>Without a word, Lorrimer strode slowly away from his companions, and
passing through the State House, hurried rapidly along Chestnut Street.</p>

<p>His manly form, his handsome face, attracted many a look, many a gaze
of admiration. But that heaving of the chest, that flashing of the hazel eye!
Little did the fair dames who gazed upon the handsome Libertine, dream of
the Hell that raged within his bosom.</p>

<p>Christmas Eve, the River and the Death, glided like a warning from
Eternity before his dilating eyes. Dim and shadow-like yet terrible, the
VISION rushed upon his Soul.</p>

<p>It was nine o'clock, when a hackney coach, driven by a Negro, whose
hideous face, afforded a strange contrast to his rich livery of dark green,
stopped before the door of Widow Smolby's house.</p>

<p>A man of slight form somewhat bent with years leaped from the couch,
and knocked at the door of the dreary mansion. His long dark robe, faced
with furs, attracted the attention of some inquisitive neighbors, who from
their doors or windows took observation of his appearance; and his sallow
face, illumined by eyes of impenetrable darkness and relieved by masses of
long black hair, hanging loosely about his shoulders, excited the wonder of
some casual bystanders. He was evidently a strange man, as the old lady
gossips have it, and his appearance, in the streets of matter-of-fact Philadelphia,
robed in this picturesque costume, was a subject of more than common
wonder among the intelligent shopkeepers of the place.</p>

<p>The door of the Widow Smolby's house was presently opened, and a
thick voice demanded the object of the visitor.</p>

<p>"Wot's the row," said the voice as a rubicund face appeared in the doorway.
"Is the President dead or has he only sent for Easy Larkspur to go
on a foreign mission? What is it?"</p>

<p>It was evident that Easy Larkspur had been wounded in a combat with a
flagon of whiskey punch. His breath was fragrant and his eyes were winking
to quick music.</p>

<p>"I would see the young lady who sought refuge in this house, last night,"
exclaimed Ravoni in his commanding tone.</p>

<p>"You would, would you? Which young lady for instance? Bess and
the Blue-eye girl went away an hour arter the old 'oman's funeral, and the
Black-eyed female sits all alone up stairs a-moanin' like the north-wind thro'
a key-hole. You see stranger I'm left here until the Crowner comes
back&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The lady up stairs is the one I wish to see," replied Ravoni. "Tell
her, that I bear a message from her father&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 366 -->

<p>"Jist walk up an' tell her yourself," muttered Larkspur. "Come in
stranger. You ought to seen the old 'omans funeral! It took place at sunrise,
and devil a preacher was at the grave to do a prayer. Giminy! Merself
and the crowner's depitty was chief mourners. Didn't we do
the groans?"</p>

<p>Closing the door, Larkspur led Ravoni through the front room on the
first floor.</p>

<p>"Now sir, up two pair o' stairs in the front room you'll find the gal.
And look ye! There's three or four maniac cats and a parrit, a-prowlin'
about unchained. If you see 'em kick 'em for my sake! Wot I've suffered
with them cats durin' the night imagination may conceive, but pen can't
depict&mdash;the devils! While I was drinkin' my punch last night&mdash;<i>mi-a-w,
spit, phiz!</i>&mdash;they puts into my hair, and me not sayin' a word&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ravoni left the gentleman in the midst of his philosophic meditations, and
ascending the stairs, in a few moments, stood before the door of the front
room on the third floor.</p>

<p>"Now for this Mad Girl," he muttered as he gently opened the door.
"This Mad Girl who fancies&mdash;ha, ha, that she is not the <i>child</i> of her <i>father!</i>"</p>

<p>He prepared himself for the sight of a gibbering idiot, and entered the
Ghost Chamber.</p>

<p>One step forward, and he receded, folding his arms as he gazed in silent
wonder upon the unexpected vision that met his sight. In the dim light
that came through the purple curtains of a window, flung open to the sunlight
for the first time in seventeen years, sat a fair young girl, dressed in
white, her hands clasped listlessly together, while the transparent paleness
of her face, was beautifully relieved by her dark hair which hung in a thick
mass along the cheek turned from the light, and then fell drooping over her
shoulder. Her eyes were downcast, and the trembling eyelashes rested
upon the alabaster of each cheek.</p>

<p>"And this is the Mad Girl!" muttered Ravoni advancing. "By my life
she looks not like a living thing, but like a carved statue of some pure and
holy Enthusiasm!"</p>

<p>Mabel raised her eyes, and gazed upon the portrait above the mantel. A
soft moisture glistened in each dark eye, and a burning glow crimsoned the
centre of each pale cheek.</p>

<p>"My mother," she muttered, and then with a start, beheld the deep eyes
of the Sorcerer fixed upon her.</p>

<p>"Start not my child," he cried in his low and musical voice. "I come
to lead you to your father!"</p>

<p>"To my father! Sooner than return to his doors again, would I beg my
bread on the highway, sooner far sooner would I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay," interrupted Ravoni, "I speak not of the <i>impostor</i>, who has
so darkly wronged you, but of your <i>father!</i>" How his musical voice lingered
on that word!</p>

<!-- page 367 -->

<p>True to the instructions which he had received from Pyne on the night
previous, he now placed the note which the Parson had written, in the hands
of the wondering girl.</p>

<p>"Ha!" she exclaimed, as she raised the note to the light. "It is a message
from my father! 'MABEL, my own child, so long lost to me, but now
forever mine, trust yourself without fear in the hands of the bearer of this
note: he will lead you to your father, to&mdash;LIVINGSTONE.' Oh joy, joy! I
am ready Sir!" she cried with a radiant countenance, as she extended her
hands toward the Sorcerer.</p>

<p>"What, without hat or cloak?" said he playfully. "You love your <i>father</i>
then?"</p>

<p>"Oh Sir, my heart beats freer at the word. Lead me, lead me to him,
to my father!"</p>

<p>Seizing an ancient and threadbare cloak, which had once rested on the
form of her mother, from a chest near the bed, she flung it over her shoulders
and stood ready to depart.</p>

<p>A calm yet meaning smile broke over the face of Ravoni, as he led her
down the stairs, and lingered around his expressive lips as he handed her
into the carriage.</p>

<p>"And this child with the beaming face and the speaking eye is the Mad
Girl," he muttered as he sprang in the carriage and closed the door. "Ho,
ho! My parson, you have entrusted your treasure to the Lion's mouth!"</p>

<p>A muttered word in a foreign tongue was the signal to the Negro in green
livery; and the coach rattled away over the rough paving stones.</p>

<p>Larkspur looked from the front door in mute and drunken wonder.</p>

<p>"Doesn't that beat pigeon-shooting? To come an' take the gal from under
my wery eyes without so much as sayin' thankee! Doesn't it beat 'possum
huntin'? I hope to grasshus some old nigger will take me as a 'prentice to
the wood splittin' business arter that! Howsomdever," he muttered as he
closed the door, "I must go and rig up as Major Rappahannock Mulhill says,
and to-night&mdash;ho, ho! Won't we nab the murderer of the old woman? Bessie
didn't tell me nothin'&mdash;oh no!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile the carriage rolled on, while Ravoni sate gazing steadily in the
beautiful face of Mabel. She felt a strange awe steal over her, as the gleam
of those dark eyes seemed to look into her soul.</p>

<p>"And she shall be the Priestess of Ravoni!" muttered the Sorcerer.</p>

<p>"And I shall see my father!" cried the fair girl in a joyous tone. "At
last I shall find a home!"</p>

<p>"<i>Here</i> you shall see your father, <i>here</i> you shall find a home!"</p>

<p>As Ravoni spoke the carriage stopped before the gloomy house, whose
bricks were painted a dull and tasteless yellow.</p>

<p>With a throbbing heart, Mabel leaped from the carriage, with every vein
fired by emotion, she ascended the marble steps, and as the door slowly

<!-- page 368 -->

opened, a wild cry of joy burst from her lips, and she entered the&mdash;&mdash;Den
of the Sorcerer.</p>

<p>Ravoni cast one look at the bright sun, ere he disappeared within the door,
and his large eyes, dilating and burning with a lustre that was superhuman,
seemed to behold some gorgeous landscape, denied to all other sight.</p>

<p>"And she shall be the Priestess of Ravoni!"</p>

<p>CHAPTER FIFTH.</p>

<p class="small">THE DISSECTING ROOM.</p>

</div>

<p>A TALL thin man, attired in a close-fitting great coat, was hurrying along
Walnut Street. His face, marked by thick eyebrows and an aquiline nose,
and imbued with an expression of deep thought, was drooped upon his chest,
and while his hands were buried in his coat pockets, he muttered to himself
as he hurried along.</p>

<p>"Beautiful operation that would be&mdash;beautiful! To take a man's skull off,
look at his brains, and then fasten it on again! Beautiful! They say it's
done in Paris. Ha! Hum! Byrnewood that you? Heard anything of your
sister yet? Sad thing that&mdash;your father told me all about it&mdash;sad thing!</p>

<p>"It is indeed Doctor," exclaimed Byrnewood, as he took McTorniquet by
the hand. "Had I but a single clue to the mystery, I would follow it to the
death. But this utter darkness is worse than death itself!"</p>

<p>"Never mind, my boy, never mind; clear up after awhile; clear up I
say!" cried the good hearted Doctor, drawing Byrnewood's arm within his
own. "By-the-bye, Byrnewood did ye ever read those accounts of '<i>burking</i>'
folks in London? Five men hung at once for murdering <i>live</i> people,
in order to sell their bodies to the Doctors! It's my opinion that that same
thing is done in this good Quaker City."</p>

<p>A terrible suspicion flashed over Byrnewood's soul.</p>

<p>"My God!" he exclaimed, "This singular disappearance of my sister&mdash;no
traces of her after she left my father's house on Wednesday night&mdash;not
a word or sign of her since the moment she crossed the threshold of her
home! Doctor, it is a horrible thought,&mdash;" He dared not syllable forth
that thought in words. <i>The dead body of his sister laid on the foul altar
of a dissecting table!</i></p>

<p>"Nonsense, nonsense," exclaimed the Doctor, reading Byrnewood's suspicion
in his look. "Come with me my boy, I want to preach you a sermon
on <i>Popular Credulity</i>. You have heard something of a man they call
the Signior Ravoni?"</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<!-- page 369 -->

<p>"He arrived in this city almost a year ago, coming from God knows
whence, and going the devil cares where. Well, this Italian or Frenchman,
or Turk or Jew, no sooner puts his foot on the soil of the Quaker City, than
he astonishes the Faculty; strikes Science dumb; plucks Theology by the
beard, and in fact walks over everybody's notions on everything.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How does he do all this?"</p>

<p>"That's the mystery. He walked into our Medical Halls unbidden, and
proved himself a great Anatomist, a splendid Surgeon. No one has had the
bravery or impudence to question him concerning his former life, because
there's a cold impenetrable gleam in his eye, that few men would like to
brave&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You spoke of his knowledge of Theology?"</p>

<p>"There it is again. I know several of our first Divines. This Ravoni
walked into their houses, unknown and unbidden, and astonished them,
<i>first</i>, by his knowledge of the theory and philosophy of the Reformation,
<i>second</i>, by his daring and atrocious sophistries&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the lawyers?"</p>

<p>"He knocks away their most elaborate arguments, constructed with all
the care that a child devotes to making a baby-house out of its toys, with
one clear word of practical reason, that is worth a world of legal tom-foolery.
The lawyers and the judges hate him worse than poison!"</p>

<p>"You spoke of <i>Popular Credulity</i>, Doctor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An unknown Pretender appears in the Quaker City, and lo! Everybody
hastens to entrust him with their own lives, and the lives of those they love.
You ask how? He gives out that he will cure the Insane, and before a day
is past he has an hundred patients under his care."</p>

<p>"Does he cure them?"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! The ugly ones he cures, and returns to their relatives with all
possible despatch. But the women, and the <i>handsome</i> women, ho, ho! 'It
will require <i>time</i>,' is his invariable answer. And then he has established a
Lecture Room, where he gives lectures on Anatomy. Egad! our students
are crazy with the fellow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You said just now that he was a skillful anatomist?"</p>

<p>"I never saw one half as good! But I'll tell you what annoys me! This
Ravoni has given out that he will reveal some important discoveries in
Anatomy at the hour of ten precisely, this morning at his Lecture Room.
He pretends that he has discovered some new Theory of the origin of life,
which he will illustrate by the dissection of a subject. This annoys me!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I believe it's all humbug, and the fact that our Professors seem
to place some confidence in the fellow, furnishes me with a very good illustration
of the popular disposition to believe in&mdash;<i>moonshine!</i></p>

<p>"You will attend the Lecture?"</p>

<!-- page 370 -->

<p>"Of course. Should you like to witness a dissection of the human subject?
It's quite a treat to the uninitiated. Come along with me."</p>

<p>The fearful suspicion which had crossed Byrnewood's mind, not many
minutes past, now returned in all its vigor. The dead body of his sister on
the dissecting table!</p>

<p>"I will go with you!" he said, and they turned into a southern street,
and after the lapse of a few minutes stood before the House of Ravoni.</p>

<p>"We enter the Dissecting Hall by this alley," said Dr. McTorniquet
leading the way along the narrow avenue on the east of the mansion. "Did
you ever see my blood horse Henry Clay?"</p>

<p>Ere Byrnewood could answer this characteristic question, the Doctor
pushed open a small door which was the only object that varied the massive
side of the mansion, from the pavement to the roof. He then led the way
up three flights of stairs, so narrow and confined, that there was barely room
for one man to pass at a time, between the walls. The last of these stairs
terminated in an extensive corridor, which traversed the entire width of the
building, with the doors of various rooms fashioned in its walls, and a wide
window at either end, giving light to the passage.</p>

<p>They traversed the corridor from east to west, and then stood before a door
of dark mahogany.</p>

<p>"First we enter the Dissecting Hall," said the Doctor as he pushed open
the door. Nodding to the hideous Negro, who attired in the green livery,
worn by all the attendants of Ravoni, stood watching within the door,
McTorniquet led Byrnewood into the centre of the hall.</p>

<p>It was a long and narrow room, with a lofty ceiling and snow-white floor.
It was lighted by five large windows on the western side; and two on the
southern end of the room. The walls were white and bare and blank, without
a solitary object to relieve their monotony of hue. Around the room,
between the windows and along the walls, were placed some twenty oblong
tables, each standing in the full glare of the sunlight, which poured freely
over the ghastly spectacles peculiar to the place. Bending over each table
was a young man, whose long hair and characteristic look of frankness and
recklessness combined, betrayed the Medical Student of the Quaker City.
At some of the tables were groups of two and three, talking earnestly together,
knife in hand all the while, and the whole body of students wore the
same dark apron reaching to the shoulders, and each arm was defended by
a false sleeve of coarse muslin. And on each table, sweltering and festering
in the sunlight, lay the remains of woman and child and a man. Here
was a grisly trunk, there an arm, there a leg, and yonder a solitary hand
occupied the attention of the Student. Rare relics of the Temple which
yesterday enshrined a Soul, born of the Living God!</p>

<p>Here a ghastly head, placed upright, with the livid lips parted in a hideous
grin, received the gay light of the sun, full on its glassy eyeballs, there a
mass of flesh and sinews and bones, shone in the beams of the morning, as

<!-- page 371 -->

Corruption only can shine. A Soul once shone from those eyes, a voice
once spoke from those lips!</p>

<p>Here lay an arm, whose soft and beautiful outlines, were terminated by a
small and graceful hand, and over the alabaster arm and the snowy hand,
the blue taint of decay spread like a foul curse, turning loveliness into loathing.
There in the full glare of the sunlight was spread a reeking trunk,
lopped short below the waist, with loathsomeness and beauty combined in
one horrible embrace. The head had been severed and below the purple
neck two white globes, the bosom of what had once been woman, were perceptible
in the light. And the Rainbow of corruption crept like a foul serpent
around that bosom. For Corruption has its Rainbow; and blue and
red and purple and grey and pink and orange were mingled together on
that trunk in one repulsive mass of decay. And on this fair bosom hands
of affection had been pressed, or sweet young children had nestled; or maybe
the white skin had crimsoned to a lover's kiss!</p>

<p>Byrnewood passed slowly along the room, gazing around in mingled
wonder and loathing, while the lively conversation of the students broke
strangely on his ear.</p>

<p>"I say Bob, this must have been a jolly old chap!" cried a young gentleman
whose snub nose harmonized with his wide mouth and cross eyes.
"No doubt these lips have opened with several thousand jolly grins in their
time&mdash;now look at them! Pah! How blue and livid!"</p>

<p>And he tossed the head of the old man down upon the table, twining his
fingers in the white hairs, while his knife severed the flesh from the brow.</p>

<p>"Sweet girl, this was once upon a time! Many a poor devil has been
dying for love of her eyes and lips. Just now she don't look altogether loveable.
The eyes starting from their sockets, and the lips falling to pieces!
And then the bosom, ha, ha! The Scalpel makes love to it now!"</p>

<p>And the sunbeams glistened upon the blade of the knife as it plied briskly
over the livid flesh.</p>

<p>"Wonder how many people have shaken hands with this old fellow?"
muttered another student, with dark eyes and stiff lank black hair. "Just
look at this hand&mdash;old and withered and hardened by toil. How these
cramped fingers have clutched at the dollars and the pennies&mdash;ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"This woman wore a deuced pretty shoe; I'll bet a dollar she did!" exclaimed
a withered little man in a bald head and gold spectacles. "Did
ever you see such a foot? And the toes, and the instep, and then what an
ankle! Wonder who knit her stockings!"</p>

<p>"He, he, he!" laughed a young Student in tow-colored hair and a pear
nose. "Jist look at that&mdash;good, capital!"</p>

<p>He had placed the mangled body of a dead man, against the wall in a sitting
posture, with the knees drawn up to the chin, and the right hand fixed
between one knee and the face, with the fingers outspread and the thumb

<!-- page 372 -->

pressed upon the nose, in a gesture very much the vogue among dirty little
boys, rowdies, and cabmen.</p>

<p>"Isn't that the touch?" laughed the tow-haired Student. "Doesn't he
say '<i>Can't come it!</i>' plain as chalk? And then that eye half shut&mdash;isn't
the wink perfect!"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! Ho! Ho! Good&mdash;capital!" chorused some dozen students.</p>

<p>And over the livid brow of the dead man, who sat erect in this attitude of
grotesque mockery, streamed the yellow sunshine coloring the leaden eyeballs
and the hanging lip with hues of vivid gold.</p>

<p>"There," murmured Doctor McTorniquet, who had been silent for the
last few minutes, "There my boy you see the respect paid by living dust to
dead ashes! Consoling sight; isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Lead me from this place," muttered Byrnewood, "The air is foul with
corruption; I'm in no mood to look upon scenes like these!"</p>

<p>"Come this way," answered McTorniquet, "Ravoni is about to reveal
his wonderful discovery in the Amphitheatre."</p>

<p>Opening a small door in one side of the Dissecting Room, the Doctor led
Byrnewood along a dark and narrow passage, which terminated in another
door. Pushing gently against this door a blaze of light streamed upon the
passage, and the Doctor entered the Amphitheatre, with Byrnewood at
his side.</p>

<p>The vivid rays of a gas light streamed down upon the square table of the
Lecturer, placed near the wall in the centre of the Amphitheatre. Around
and above this table rose thick tiers of benches, arranged in the form of a
half circle, and ascending in easy gradation from the floor to the ceiling of
the spacious room. A partition of painted board separated the table of the
Lecturer from his audience, and immediately in front was the main entrance
to the Amphitheatre, forming an alley in the centre of the room, with tiers
of benches on either side.</p>

<p>The place was thronged by a dense array of spectators. Faces arose
above faces, from the floor to the ceiling. Some four or five hundred students
from the various Medical Schools of the Quaker City, had assembled
in the Lecture Room, anxious to witness the wonderful discovery, announced
by Ravoni. The singular mystery which enveloped the man, his profuse
charity to all poor students who came within his notice, his enormous
charges to the opulent class of medical aspirants, the large mansion which
he had furnished in a style of oriental magnificence, the various strange
stories which floated on the current of popular rumor in relation to his former
life&mdash;all these things combined had not only excited the curiosity of the
students, but of their Masters. The grave faces of Doctor and Professor,
were seen amid the reckless visages of long-haired sons of Virginia, and
swarthy striplings from Alabama.</p>

<p>The devil-dare Carolinian with his unstrapped boots resting on the next
bench below his seat, was companioned by the care-worn man of science

<!-- page 373 -->

with gold spectacles on his hooked nose. The lean Yankee, the round-Paced
Pennsylvanian, the pale and emaciated youth of Philadelphia, the blustering
Hoosier from the far west, all were mingled together in that motley crowd.
Ravoni had announced a great discovery in medical science; his tickets were
free, his invitation general to all the faculty, and to every man and boy of
the students under their care, and therefore his Lecture Room was brimming
full.</p>

<p>Byrnewood and McTorniquet found each a vacant seat close beside the
Lecturer's table. Scarce had they time to seat themselves and glance around,
when the green-baize door at the head of the principal passage which divided
the Lecture Room in the centre, was thrown suddenly open, and two uncouth
men bearing a burden on their shoulders, came forward with hurried
footsteps.</p>

<p>They laid their burden on the table, and every eye beheld the outlines of
a corpse, as it lay with its stiffened limbs concealed in the folds of a tattered
white overcoat.</p>

<p>A light footstep was now heard from the narrow passage, by which Byrnewood
had entered, and in an instant Ravoni stood beside the table, his sallow
cheeks and thoughtful brow, warming with a slight flush as the loud
welcome of the audience broke like thunder on his ear.</p>

<p>Ravoni gazed into the faces of the two men who stood before him. Their
visages would have hung them in any Christian community. Their faces
had been unshaven for days, and a stiff red beard mingling with the lank
red hair that covered their foreheads, gave a cut-throat look to each visage.
They stood with their eyes fixed upon the floor, as though they feared to
look into the face of a living man.</p>

<p>"From whence did you bring this subject?" said Ravoni in a low whisper.</p>

<p>"From the poor man's grave in the Alms-house graveyard," answerer
the tallest of the Resurrectionists. "Yer honor knows there's one grave
which is the prope'ty o' th' Doctors? Anybody what dies in the Alms-house
and hain't got no friends to claim him, is put into this grave, and the
d&mdash;l himself may take him if he likes.</p>

<p>"Ven yer honer's done with that body I should like to have my great
coat again," observed the short Body-stealer in a mild and polite whisper.</p>

<p>"We got the subject in the night, Sir, and wrapped it up in that great
coat, and it hain't been opened since. Hope it 'ill suit yer honer?"</p>

<p>Ravoni waved his hands and the Body-stealers tramped out of the Lecture
Room.</p>

<p>Every eye was now centered upon Ravoni. Some wild burst of his accustomed
eloquence was anticipated, some rhapsody which mingling the sublime
and the mystic, would rouse the hearts of the auditors into wonder and
enthusiasm. But no word passed from his lips. In silence he proceeded to
lay bare the corpse. Glancing at the case of instruments placed on one
corner of the table, he slowly flung aside the tattered overcoat which enveloped
the dead man.</p>

<!-- page 374 -->

<p>There was an awful silence. Every eye beheld the corpse, and every
heart grew cold with dread. Ravoni himself at the sight of that hideous
spectacle started backward with a pale cheek and a trembling lip. Then the
first awful pause of terror was past, and a murmured cry of horror shook the
room.</p>

<p>There, there on the dissecting table lay the corpse, its features set in death
and its blue eyeballs glaring on the ceiling, but it was not the '<i>subject</i>' anticipated
by Ravoni or his pupils. From head to foot, along the trunk and over
each limb, that corpse was all one cankering sore, one loathsome blotch.
Features on the face there were none; brow and lip and cheek were all one
hideous ulcer. The eyeballs were spotted with clotted blood; the mouth a
cavern of corruption; the very hair was thick with festering pollution. It
was the corpse of a man who had died from that terrible of all diseases, the
most infectious of all epidemics, a curse at whose name beauty shudders and
grave science grows pale&mdash;the small-pox. Better to look into the plague-pit
where man and woman and babe lay mingled together, one reeking mass
of quick lime and gory flesh, then to have gazed upon that corpse extended
on the Dissecting table before the eyes of five hundred living men!</p>

<p>Every man in that room felt his danger, as that ghastly sight dashed ice
into his heart. Every man knew that there was infection in every breath he
drew, that there was a death linked with every atom that floated in the air.</p>

<p>Ravoni stood silent and pale. There he stood with eternal youth in his
veins but in his twelve brief hours, he might lay a foul thing of ulcers and
blotches, like the corse before his eyes. For the common phases of this disease,
there were remedies; but let a single infectious atom breathed from
the lips of a corse like this, enter the lips of living man, and no arm under
God's sky could bring relief.</p>

<p>To lay a corse, with no calm beauty speaking from the pale brow, no
gentle smile moulding the livid lips! To lay a mass of gory flesh and stagnant
blood, to decay before your last hour, to anticipate the rottenness of
the grave while life yet lingers in your veins! That thought, paled even
the cheek of Ravoni, and the spectators, Doctors, Student and Professor,
were spell-bound with a fear worse than death.</p>

<p>A wild cry of horror shook the room, and then in one mass the audience
rushed toward the door. It was a living picture of a panic. With one
movement they swept from the benches, with one bound they sprang into
the narrow passage, and then another wild cry added horror to the scene.
The main door opened <i>into</i> the room, and the crowd blocked up against its
panels, were helpless as a child in a tiger's cage. Still Ravoni stood silent
and pale, regarding the loathsome corse with a fixed stare.</p>

<p>Then moving as one mass, with a force like the impulse of a battering
ram, the dense throng rushed against the door, crushing all who stood near
its panels until they howled in very agony, and then came another rush and
another yell! There was a wild crashing sound; the door gave way;

<!-- page 375 -->

splintered into fragments it fell before the living mass, and through the opened
passage, the panic-stricken crowd rushed from the place of death.</p>

<p>Ravoni still was beside the corse. The crowd was gone but a young
man, with long black hair and a flashing eye, stood by his side. It was
Byrnewood Arlington. He too had seen the crowd, he too had looked upon
the corse, he too had felt some throbbings of the panic, which like a heart
of terror, palpitated in the air of room, but he still stood silent and firm, though
ashy pale. The Doctor had fled from his side with an involuntary shriek
of fear, the face of the Sorcerer himself had grown pale, but the awful mystery
resting like a nightmare upon the soul of Byrnewood Arlington left no
room for a lesser terror.</p>

<p>"Thou hast a firm soul," said Ravoni in that low toned voice, which was
music to the ear that heard it. "Thou hast a firm soul!"</p>

<p>He laid his hand on Byrnewood's shoulder as he spoke, and the magnetic
ray of his eye, held the glance of the young man enchained to his own. A
strange sympathy for the being before him, fluttered through Byrnewood's
heart.</p>

<p>"Thou hast a firm soul," spoke the Sorcerer, "And by my soul, yes,"
he added setting his teeth together, while his eyes shone and his brow
warmed with a sudden enthusiasm, "By the Soul of Ravoni thou shalt be
one of the Chosen; thou shalt be a Priest of the Faith!"</p>

<p>"The Faith?" echoed young Arlington.</p>

<p>"The new Faith which shall arise over the ashes of the creeds and superstitions
of this day. The Faith which dwelt in the hearts of men, ere
the Sword of the Jew or the Cross of the Christian or the Crescent of the
Sorcerer arose on the horizon of man's soul, scattering pestilence and death,
wherever they flashed or shone! That Faith, buried for long, long centuries
which man in the olden time, in the world's youth of promise, loved and
cherished, which raised him to godhead, and made the Universe itself his
own, that Faith will we raise from the grim ruins of fable and superstition!
And the old Faith, revised and re-created shall be our New Religion of hope
to Man!"</p>

<p>The words of the Sorcerer were wild and strange, but his look and tone,
were lightning and music to Byrnewood's soul. He was awed, he was fascinated.
Slowly he reached forth his arm, and with his eyes fixed on the
eyes of Ravoni, he seized the Sorcerer by the hand.</p>

<p>"<i>This hour shalt thou behold the dead arise!</i>" exclaimed Ravoni with
his deep dark eyes, alive with the rays of magnetic power. "Come!"</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, ho!" laughed a rough voice. "The doctor and the students
all skeered to death by a bundle o' small-pox! Wonders how that 'ill vurk?"</p>

<p>And hurrying from the secret passage, Devil-Bug emerged into the light,
his distorted face convulsed with sneering laughter and his solitary eye
twinkling in hideous glee, while his tangled hair fell thickly over his protuberant
brow.</p>

<!-- page 376 -->

<p>Byrnewood started at the sound of that voice: he advanced toward the
savage. Devil-Bug beheld him, and turned pale.</p>

<p>"What!" he shouted, "Another sperrit come to ha'nt me? Ho, ho!
There 'll be a miliskey muster of 'em arter a while! There&mdash;there lays
the man with his jaw broke and his tongue lollin' out&mdash;there, right at my
feet is the old woman with the blood a droppin' from the holler skull&mdash;but
<i>this</i> feller!"</p>

<p>With his talon fingers extended he turned aside his head, while his frame
quivered with emotion.</p>

<p>"I have seen you before!" cried Byrnewood laying his hand on the arm
of the monster. "I have seen you, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A sperrit couldn't grip me that way!" muttered Devil-Bug, "I see how
it is&mdash;he escaped from the well, tho' the boards cracked from under him,
and here he is with his ricollecshun destroyed by the drug!"</p>

<p>"I have seen you before," repeated Byrnewood in a whispered voice, inaudible
to Ravoni. "Tell me, oh tell me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He would have demanded his sister of the savage, but a wild laugh
drowned his words.</p>

<p>"You've seen me afore? Werry likely young man. Public charact'rs
like the President and me, is to be seen most any day in the week, by sich
persons as likes! And then my name young man, my name is pe<i>coo</i>liar&mdash;You
know it among ten thousand&mdash;my name is <i>sich</i> a sing'lar one! It's
<i>Jones</i>, young man, nothin' but <i>Jones!</i>"</p>

<p>"Madman!" muttered Ravoni advancing. "Do you trifle in my
presence? Away and to your watch! See that no one enters the chamber
beside whose door I placed you this morning&mdash;Begone!"</p>

<p>Devil-Bug trembled beneath the glance of his eye, like a raven who dreads
the attack of an eagle. He slunk quietly into the secret passage, and in a
moment was gone.</p>

<p>"Come!" said Ravoni in a whisper, as he placed Byrnewood's arm
within his own. "You shall behold the Miracle!"</p>

<p>Ten thousand thoughts whirled through Byrnewood's brain. The grief
of his father and mother, the mystery which enveloped the fate of his sister
and then the sweet smiling face of that sister, with her brown hair waving
along her rose-bud cheeks, all were present with him, and his soul was a
chaos with uncertain gleams of light playing over the summit of tossing
clouds. But the eyes of Ravoni were fixed upon him; he felt his veins fire
and his heart kindle as that glare shot into his soul, like a ray of light from
the eternal world.</p>

<p>"I go with you!" he whispered and his pale cheek glowed with a new
fire, and his dark eye gathered a strange light.</p>

<p>CHAPTER SIXTH.</p>

<p class="small">THE FIRST MIRACLE OF THE NEW FAITH.</p>

</div>

<p>THE taint of corruption and the breath of incense, the shrouded form of
the dead and the dark-robed figure of the Sorcerer, the commanding forehead,
over-arching eyes that sent forth rays of majestic power, and the pale brows
of enthusiasts lit by eyes hollow with watching, and flashing with unnatural
light, these all were there, in that chamber of the New Faith.</p>

<p>It was a spacious chamber, circular in shape with lofty walls, and a wide
celling, which in the centre arose into a dome. From this dome, a star of
burning light flung its lustre down over the centre of the chamber, while
from the dim shadows of the room, white columns of incense wound slowly
upward, like the hope of a true soul gleaming through the darkness of its
despair.</p>

<p>In the centre of that chamber all was light, while beyond, save the snowy
columns of incense, all was darkness. And in the centre of the chamber,
beneath the moon-like radiance of the light falling from the dome, was a
strange and fearful spectacle, more like a wild dream on a picture of some
olden-time tradition, than a plain and palpable reality.</p>

<p>An altar white as snow arose in the light, with its drapery falling in gentle
folds down to the sable floor. On one side of the altar, calm and impassable
stood Ravoni, gazing intently upon the faces of twenty-four young men,
who sate grouped along the floor on the opposite side, their eyes enchained
to his glance with a singular intensity.</p>

<p>These young men were Students, gleaned by Ravoni from the various
medical schools, and from the haunts and nooks of the wide city. The light
shone over haggard faces, high pale foreheads, well developed in the ideal
organs, and white hands tremblingly grasping rolls of manuscript. There
was a wild light shining from the eyes of every one of the twenty-four, a
fixed glare, a feverish and unhealthy brightness. It was the meteor light of
fanaticism. Their careless attire, their long hair flung loosely over each
shoulder, their fixed gaze and their statue-like stillness, all betrayed the
absorbing and painful interest with which they awaited the words of the Sorcerer.</p>

<p>And among the foremost, pale and wild as the palest and wildest of them
all sate Byrnewood Arlington. He too, gazed upon the face of Ravoni with
a woven brow and flashing eye. His hands were convulsively clasped upon
his knees, and his under lip was pressed between his teeth.</p>

<p>And on the altar, lay a stiffened corpse, whose outlines were dimly seen
through the folds of a white cloth, flung lightly over each icy limb. There
was beauty in that corpse, and grace, for the cloth was moulded into soft

<!-- page 378 -->

folds, as though it veiled a woman's form. The feet were thrust upward, the
arms folded over the chest, and the globes of the bosom rose gently in the
light, even beneath their thick disguise. The face, like the form was veiled
from the gaze, yet the outlines of a countenance, which death had only made
more sternly beautiful, were clear and apparent.</p>

<p>Ravoni stood by the altar and the corpse, his slight form clad in robes of
deep sable, while his long black hair fell wild and lank about his shoulders.
There was an unusual expression stamped upon his face, not manifested indeed
in any violent working of the muscles, or sudden contortion of the
features. All was calm, and yet it was a calm full of omen. The scornful
lips pressed lightly together, the nostrils quivering with a scarcely perceptible
motion, the forehead, high, wide and massive, impressed with a look of
conscious mind, and the eyes, dark, full and thoughtful, glaring a light that
sent forth rays like a star. There was a silent intensity of thought revealed
in every line of that pale countenance.</p>

<p>And the light from the dome streamed over the dark robes and pale brow
of Ravoni, over the white cloth which revealed the outlines of the corpse,
and upon the faces of the Students, who sate waiting in awed silence for the
words of their master, while up from the dark corners of the room curled
the white incense, strewing the air with grateful perfume, and the shadows
with scarfs of snowy mist.</p>

<p>Ravoni gazed upon the faces of the Students, and then his lips moved, but
no sound broke upon the air.</p>

<p>He was about to make a dread and awful experiment, not with machinery
of wood or iron, or with the air or the lightning in its bosom, or with the
earth or the secrets of its depths, but with something more terrible than all,
the Soul of Man.</p>

<p>For a moment, a voice seemed whispering in his ear, a voice speaking
from the Invisible world to his soul, words of strange import.</p>

<p>"Ravoni there is a God! Ravoni there is a God! Blaspheme not his
name!"</p>

<p>In a low and musical tone he spoke of the New Faith, while the voice
within was whispering unceasingly to his soul.</p>

<p>"There has been too much of God," were the first words he uttered.
"There has been too much of God in all the creeds of the world! Where-ever
Fanaticism has raised its fanes, there the name of God has been
mouthed by the foul lips of priests.</p>

<p>"The Hindoo mother gives her child to the Ganges in the name of God,
and the car of Juggernaut crushes its thousands, who shriek that name as
they are mingled in one gory massacre!</p>

<p>"The torch of St. Bartholomew was lit in the name of God, the fair fields
of Ireland have been soaked with the blood of her children, while that name
shrieked in every musket shot! Europe has been desolated in the name of

<!-- page 379 -->

God! In a single foul and atrocious war, nine million souls went down to
one bloody grave, because they did not believe with their King that the God-head
centered in a paltry wafer! The name of God was shrieked by booted
troopers and cowled priests over their desolate hearth-sides, over a land rich
in graves and blood!</p>

<p>"In this fair land of the New World, the children of the Forest were hunted
and butchered in the name of God! It mingled with cry of death and it
shrieked in the blood-hounds' yell! Helpless women and aged men were
burnt by grim sectarians, who gazed upon the blackened flesh of their victims,
and shouted glory to the name of God!</p>

<p>"In this name earth has been desolated ten thousand times and ten thousand
times again. In this name home has been made a hell, the gardens of
the world transformed into howling deserts, the heart of man changed into a
devil! In this name blood has flown in rivers, and in this name earth has
been made a pest-house, with its valleys levelled into plains, and its hills
raised into mountains with the heaps of dead!</p>

<p>"These things have been done in the name of God! You may say that
they were the work of ignorance, of superstition, of fanaticism, but still that
blistering fact, stands out from the history of the world, <i>these crimes were
done in the name of God!</i></p>

<p>"<i>Now!</i>" and his voice rose into a tone of absorbing enthusiasm, while
his white hand undulated over the corpse. "<i>Now!</i> Aye <i>now</i> the time has
come, when something for <i>man</i> should be done in the name of MAN!"</p>

<p>A wild murmur of applause trembled from lip to lip. The dark eyes of
the twenty-four enthusiasts shone with the wild light of fanaticism.</p>

<p>Byrnewood Arlington leaned forward with flashing eyes and parted lips
while he felt his soul drawn to Ravoni by a strange yet irresistible sympathy.
Ever and anon his eye wandered to the corse, and with a shudder
he withdrew his gaze from the spectacle of death. A dim suspicion crept
over him, that the form of his sister lay on that altar, a lifeless corse. It
was a horrible thought, and in his soul he knew it false and baseless, yet
whenever he glanced upon the white cloth which shrouded the face of the
dead, <i>it was his sister that lay there!</i></p>

<p>"In the name of MAN and for the good of MAN shall our new Faith arise!"
exclaimed Ravoni in his deep toned voice. "Yet think not that Ravoni denies
God! No, no! Over the body of the dead, I preach unto you a pure
and merciful God! Through all matter, through sun and sky and earth and
air, he lives, the soul of the Universe! We are all beams of his light, rays
of his sun; as imperishable as his own glory! To us all, he has entrusted
powers, awful and sublime. Think not because these powers may never be
manifested that they do not exist. They are all in us, and in us for good.</p>

<p>"All men from the slave to the prince, from the dull boor to the man of
genius, are connected with each other by an universal sympathy, an invisible
influence on which souls float and undulate like rays in the sunshiny

<!-- page 380 -->

air. This* influence or sympathy, call it what you will, is the atmosphere
of souls, the life of intellects!</p>

<p class="small">[*It may be presumed that a reference is intended to the doctrine of magnetic influence,
pervading all space, and linking man to man, and man to God, by the same awful and
immutable power.]</p>

<p>"Some men absorbing a larger portion of this invisible life than others,
become men of genius, warriors or statesmen.</p>

<p>"And through the long and drear and bloody history of this world are
recorded instances of mighty souls, who appeared on the earth, gifted with
powers that made men worship them as Gods. These men were thoroughly
imbued with the atmosphere in which the soul breathes thoughts of God-ship.
These intellects were known as Saviors, Prophets, Reformers. They were
distinguished by an irresistible power, which beaming from the brow or flashing
from the eye, awed and subdued the souls of the million. These men
demonstrated the great truth, that the AWFUL SOUL having created us, hath
left us all to our own salvation or our ruin, as we shall by our deeds determine;
thus we shape our own destinies; that we are the masters of our own
lives; that we, by developing the mysteries implanted in our bosoms, may
walk the earth superior to the clay around us, each man <i>a</i> GOD <i>in soul!</i>"</p>

<p>Vain were it to depict that outstretched hand, that flashing eye, that look
and port of mystery! As one man, the twenty-four students rose to their
feet, and a dark-eyed youth tossed his arms wildly on high, and muttered
with white lips, "Ravoni is a God&mdash;Ravoni is a God!"</p>

<p>And the murmur broke over the throng in a whisper full of meaning,
"Ravoni is a God&mdash;Ravoni is a God!"</p>

<p>The light from the dome fell over the Sorcerer, the Corse and the enthusiasts,
while up from the shadows of the chamber, wound the columns of
snowy incense.</p>

<p>"As ye all may be gods, so am I a God! As ye all may look into the
bosom of the Universe, and make the secrets of nature your own, train the
lightnings to your will, and sweep the souls of men in adoration at your feet,
so have I done!</p>

<p>"And you my chosen Priests will I bind together in a high and solemn
Brotherhood, as the first ministers at the altars of the Faith! In silence and
in mystery will we compass the wide land, selecting our converts from the
mass, as we shall know them worthy of our mysteries, and adding them
one by one to our holy brotherhood! No loud prayers in the tinselled
church, no vapid trumpetings of our godliness from street to corners, but
slowly and silently and in power will we work for the New Faith, built in
the name of MAN for the good of MAN!"</p>

<p>Well had Ravoni chosen his converts from the young, the hopeful, the enthusiastic!
His words uttered in that deep music of tone which mingling
with the syllables of speech, can allure the human soul to good or evil,
struck the mysterious chords of every heart. They were no longer the

<!-- page 381 -->

same men. Every face was stamped with an excitement that corded the
veins on the forehead, and fired the eyes with a blaze like that which streamed
from the dark orbs of Ravoni. It was a terrible picture of Fanaticism.</p>

<p>"We are thine!" they shouted in one voice raising their hands in the
light, "We are thine!"</p>

<p>Byrnewood Arlington was no more himself. He stood amid that throng
with an eye blazing and a hand uplifted. "We are thine!" he joined in the
chorus of fanatics. "<i>I</i> am thine!" he shouted in a voice that rolled to the
dome above, "<i>I</i> am thine!"</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. A picture of Sorcery, Death and
Fanaticism! The form of Ravoni with the uplifted hand, the throng of
frenzied enthusiasts, and the still corse of the dead. On the brow of Ravoni
sat calmness and grandeur, while his eye shone with a brightness all its own;
the still corse, in its stern quietude presenting an emblem of rest; the fanatics
crowding in a group with uplifted hands joined together, and faces quivering
with emotion, while the soft light showered down upon the scene from
the dome overhead, and the incense ascended evermore from the dim shadows
of the chamber.</p>

<p>"Ye shall witness a proof of my power," exclaimed Ravoni. "You all
behold the Corse laid prostrate on this altar. When this Corse arises from
the sleep of death, then shall our Faith commence its reign&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A murmur of wonder interrupted the words of the Sorcerer.</p>

<p>"I tell you the dead shall arise!" exclaimed Ravoni, and then in short
and vivid sentences, he described the Mysteries of life and death.</p>

<p>As thought after thought fell from his lips, his manner grew more animated,
the interest of his hearers more intense. His treatment of the subject
manifested immense research combined with ingenious sophistry. Now
dealing in wild rhapsody, and now giving one of his points of argument, all
the clearness of a mathematical demonstration, he averred in plain terms
that the dead might be raised to life. He dimly insinuated a belief in the
principle of eternal youth, and then gave a cursory yet forcible glance at
the long history of the search after a 'universal solvent,' which would change
the baser metals into solid gold.</p>

<p>His hearers were rapt, silent, and motionless. Every point of his argument
stood displayed before them like a palpable thing.</p>

<p>"I will raise the dead before your eyes!" he exclaimed yet again, as he
surveyed the faces of his auditors. "It is now within five minutes of noon-day.
At the hour of noon, the Corse before you shall arise!"</p>

<p>Then folding his arms across his breast he strode slowly up and down
the floor beside the altar. Now was the moment for his face to manifest an
agitation tenfold more powerful than the emotion displayed by the most enthusiastic
of the students. That frowning brow beneath which the half-hidden
eyeball gleamed with fixed and glassy light, that lip quivering with a

<!-- page 382 -->

tremulous motion, those white hands clutching nervously at the chest! Can
it be that the Sorcerer fears the failure of his magic in this, his hour of trial?</p>

<p>In silent wonder the students resumed their seats, and a young man beside
Byrnewood took forth his watch, and noted the seconds as they
fled, with a wild and haggard eye.</p>

<p>A minute passed!</p>

<p>Byrnewood gazed vacantly upon the veiled corse, and muttered incoherently
to himself. "Am I dreaming? Why does he not lift the cloth from the
face of the dead?"</p>

<p>And then as in very fear that the lifting of the cloth might reveal his sister's
face, he turned his head aside and shaded his eyes with his hand. Not
a word passed from the lips of the Enthusiasts. All was silent as the grave.</p>

<p>The second minute passed!</p>

<p>Ravoni approached the corse. "Ha! He will lift the cloth at last!"
muttered Byrnewood starting from his seat. The Sorcerer placed his hand
beneath the veil and drew forth into the light, the fingers of an icy hand.
"How dead and cold!"</p>

<p>Again he resumed his walk beside the altar, again the Students sank back
into quivering suspense.</p>

<p>"Lift the shroud from the face of the dead!" gasped Byrnewood, and then
is if startled by the sound of his own voice, he shuddered and grew pale.</p>

<p>Ravoni advanced to the Corse again. Slowly, slowly he lifted up the
grave-cloth. First the face was visible, then the neck and bosom, then the
body of the corse, and then the limbs. Dead, dead cold and dead! White
yes as the stainless snow! Pure, aye pure as God's own light!</p>

<p>Why did that yell die in Byrnewood's throat? What fiend was it that
choked the agony, as it gurgled up from his heaving chest? Whose hot
fingers were those that burnt his eyeballs? Why might he not gaze steadily
at the sight? Why did his eyes swim in fiery moisture, why did his
brain burn as with a red hot iron pressing against the bare skull one moment,
and the next grow icy cold?</p>

<p>The Students rose up in silent astonishment, in rapt wonder.</p>

<p>It was the corse of a young and beautiful woman. There was a smile on
the lips, a calm glory beaming from the face, around whose swelling outlines,
a warm mass of golden hair curled and twined and glistened. The
round arms folded on the breast, the white fingers gently clasped, and the
snowy bosom with the blue threaded veins, that bosom whose fulness bespoke
the mother&mdash;ah! Death was there in holy beauty. Fairer form than
that, did painter never shape, sweeter limbs than those did sculptor never
carve.</p>

<p>Yet she was dead, ah, cold and dead! And the light streamed warmly
over the marble whiteness of that uncovered form, revealing beauties on
which the worms were soon to riot. Over the round limbs, over the white
bosom, over the beaming face the worms would crawl, marking their progress

<!-- page 383 -->

with the blue taint of decay. And Ravoni could raise this corse to
life again? Mockery of mockeries!</p>

<p>One cry shrieked from the Students' lips.</p>

<p>"Raise the dead to life, Ravoni, raise the dead to life and we will worship
thee!"</p>

<p>His arms resting on his knees, his face half veiled in his hands Byrnewood
chuckled to himself with an idiot laugh.</p>

<p>It was not his sister; it was not Mary; that delusion had vanished. The
delusion was over, but the reality was there!</p>

<p>In that corse Byrnewood beheld the form of Annie, the Poor Man's
daughter, the Seduced, the Mother! "It is a dream," chuckled Byrnewood
with an idiot laugh, "I am haunted by her corse&mdash;it is a dream!" The
Student by his side picked up the watch which had fallen to the floor.</p>

<p>Three minutes had past!</p>

<p>Not a word was spoken. As motionless, as silent, as pale as the corpse
itself, the students clustered round the altar.</p>

<p>"Ha!" suddenly whispered one enthusiast to another. "Do you mark
that faint color in the cheek!"</p>

<p>"Silence," muttered the other student, "There is no color there! Yet,
ha! Do you not see the bosom heave?"</p>

<p>It was all fancy. No color gave warmth to the cheek, no throb of life
swelled the white bosom.</p>

<p>Another long and weary minute past, each second told by the gasping
breath of the awed enthusiasts. One minute alone remained!</p>

<p>"Restore the dead, Ravoni," muttered one of the Students, "Restore the
dead or thou art false even as yon corpse is cold!"</p>

<p>The Sorcerer stood silently regarding the body of the dead girl. His
face was fearfully calm, but his dark eyes blazed with a terrible light.</p>

<p>"On this miracle I peril my soul!" cried Ravoni between his set teeth.</p>

<p>"One half minute is all that is left thee!" whispered a dark browed student
in a voice tremulous with the agony of suspense.</p>

<p>Ravoni extended his hand; it was white as marble, and the beaded sweat
glistened along the slender fingers.</p>

<p>"Arise ye dead!" he muttered, and pressed his lips to the clay cold lips
of the corpse.</p>

<p>A wild murmur of fear from the whole band of Students! A murmur and
a start, and then a fearful silence.</p>

<p>The cheeks of the dead had warmed with rosy life, the bosom heaved, and
one hand moved gently to and fro!</p>

<p>"Arise ye dead!" shrieked Ravoni with the cold sweat on his brow.
"Arise ye dead!"</p>

<p>The hand of the dead girl was slowly raised; flushes of warmth ran over
the limbs; the eyelids began to unclose.</p>

<!-- page 384 -->

<p>"Arise ye dead! Arise&mdash;arise! For the third time I bid thee&mdash;arise!"</p>

<p>One shuddering start of horror!</p>

<p>The body of the dead girl quivered, the bosom heaved, the limbs shook.
Then a shudder ran over her frame, and with a convulsive start the body
rose on one arm, the eyelids unclosed, and the blue eyes gazed wonderingly
around.</p>

<p>"Hail, hail Ravoni, we worship thee!"</p>

<p>Raising himself from his idiotic stupor, as that shout burst on his ear, Byrnewood
rushed through the group, he beheld the uncovered form of the girl
warming with life, he saw the blue eyes gazing around with a look of wild
bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Annie!" he shouted, and sank kneeling beside the altar. His head dropped
on her bosom, his arms encircled her form. He was stiff and cold and
lifeless as marble.</p>

<p>The fair girl gazed round upon the group, her blue eyes swimming in
frenzy.</p>

<p>"My child," she murmured, extending her hands with a maniac smile
"Where have you taken my child?"</p>

<p>CHAPTER SEVENTH.</p>

<p class="small">RAVONI AND MABEL.</p>

</div>

<p>IT was one o'clock when a dashing carriage, with cream colored panels
and a liveried driver, came rattling along the street, and halted suddenly in
front of the House of Ravoni. The bay horses were all a-foam with exertion,
and their harness was covered with dust. They had evidently been
driven at a most unreasonable speed, and now they struck the hard stones
with their fore feet, and tossing their long manes on the air, manifested their
impatience by a long and quivering neigh.</p>

<p>The carriage door was thrown open, and Fitz-Cowles sprang out upon the
pavement. He was attired in a dark travelling overcoat, copiously adorned
with frogs and braid, and he still flourished his gold-headed cane in his right
hand.</p>

<p>"Come on Parson," he exclaimed, glancing within the carriage door.
"You know I must send the girl on to New York to-night&mdash;there is no
time to lose. She shall accompany me to England," he muttered between
his teeth. "But Dora, ha, ha, she must not know a word about it. Come
on Parson!"</p>

<p>"Wait," responded that well-known voice from within the carriage,
"Wait till I compose my features into the proper Patent-Gospel look. Now
Fitz, how does that go? Saintly enough&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>The good Dr. Pyne stepped from the carriage, and taking Fitz-Cowles'
arm within his own, ascended the marble steps of the yellow house. He

<!-- page 385 -->

rang the bell with a godly smile; his eyes were turned up, and the corners
of his mouth were turned down, while his soul seemed to be meditating upon
the unfortunate state of the unconverted Hindoos.</p>

<p>In a moment the hideous face of Abhar was visible in the doorway.</p>

<p>"I would speak with the Signior Ravoni!" said Dr. Pyne, bowing to the
mass of ugliness, with an air of deep deference.</p>

<p>The negro pointed toward the main stairway, and then closing the front
door, left Dr. Pyne and his friend to make the best of their way to the Audience
Chamber of Ravoni. They ascended the stairway and stood at the
commencement of the entry on the second floor, which was dimly illumined
by a small window in the southern wall. Passing along the entry, they
well-nigh stumbled over a dark object, which was laid in front of a door,
fashioned into the western wall of the corridor.</p>

<p>"Hello, Parson, what's that?" ejaculated Fitz-Cowles. "Does the old
Conjurer lay traps for a man's feet in this way?"</p>

<p>"Never mind&mdash;let's see to the girl," grumbled the Parson. As he spoke
they entered the Audience Chamber of Ravoni. The noon-day sun came
faint and dimly through the thick curtains that obscured the lofty windows.
The place was full of gloom and shadow, and the thickly carpeted floor gave
no echo to the footsteps of the intruders.</p>

<p>"I say we're alone," muttered Fitz-Cowles. "This cursed den really
makes a fellow shiver&mdash;&mdash;black ceiling, black curtains, black carpet&mdash;ugh!
Where's the Sorcerer?"</p>

<p>"He will be along presently," muttered Dr. Pyne in a bland whisper.
"Now Fitz, suppose we could get the little maiden away from this den
without the Sorcerer's knowledge?</p>

<p>"It would be vastly convenient&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Va-s-tly! Save all disagreeable explanations. Ha&mdash;hum! What's
this?"</p>

<p>Approaching the western side of the Audience Chamber, his eye was fixed
upon a ray of red light which streamed from a crevice in the dark curtaining.
A grim smile broke over the Preacher's visage.</p>

<p>"Look here Fitz," he whispered. "The entrance to another room, I
vow!" He slowly swung the dark curtains aside and gazed through the
aperture, while a blaze of light streamed over his round visage and the
swarthy face of his companion.</p>

<p>"Look <i>there</i> my boy!" chuckled Pyne with a fat parson's chuckle. Fitz-Cowles
applied his gold headed cane to his lips, and muttered in a distinct
tone the monosyllable, '<i>dam</i>,' biting it off short, like an epicure tasting a
delicious morsel.</p>

<p>Along the dark entry and up the dim stairway, Ravoni had led the trembling
Mabel, as with her heart fluttering with a new emotion, she expected to
behold her father's face and rest upon her father's bosom for the first time
in her dreary life of suffering and wrong.</p>

<!-- page 386 -->

<p>"I shall behold my father, at last," she said gazing over her shoulder
with a soft light beaming from her dark eyes.</p>

<p>"Thou shalt!" answered Ravoni in a tone that trembled with emotion.
"Enter this door. A little while and thou shalt rest in thy father's arms!"</p>

<p>He pushed her gently through a small door fashioned in the western wall
of the corridor. Mabel looked around in wonder. She was alone. She
stood in a large chamber, with a trembling light burning on a small table
near its centre. The light was faint and dim, yet it served to disclose the
gorgeous furniture of the place, the silken hangings falling from the lofty
ceiling to the carpeted floor, the glittering mirrors, the chairs, the sofa and
the dark mantel adorned with figures of spotless alabaster.</p>

<p>"And this is my father's home!" muttered Mabel sinking into a cushioned
arm-chair beside the table in the centre of the room. She clasped her
hands, and gazed silently around the place. <i>Her father's home!</i> Gorgeous
furniture, crimson curtains, carpets that gave no echo to the footstep,
massive mirrors and a cheerful fire burning on a wide hearth, scattering
warmth and comfort round! This was a gorgeous home for thee, poor orphan,
but its glory in thy sight had been nothing, were it not for the thought,
that a <i>father's heart</i> throbbed within those lofty walls.</p>

<p>"My father's home!" she murmured again, and then fell into a waking
dream, which glided away into a soft and dreamless sleep. When she
awoke, some unknown hand had substituted large wax lights for the trembling
lamp, and placed refreshments on the table by her side.</p>

<p>"Will <i>he</i> soon return?" the whisper broke from her lips, and then turning
round she listened to a faint murmur that broke on her ear. It required
a moment for her eye to grow accustomed to the darkness which shrouded
the farther corners of the room, and then with a start she fancied she beheld
two faces peering grimly upon her, through an aperture in the crimson
hangings.</p>

<p>"It is all fancy!" she muttered turning her face away from the sight.
"It cannot be my persecutor! Here at least, I am safe from his violence&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was the sound of a hurried footstep&mdash;Mabel started to her feet in
fear, and ere she could look around, she felt the folds of the dark robe
which she wore, drawn closely about her limbs, while a hoarse laugh broke
on her ear.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, my bird! Have I caught you? You will run away from
your kind father, will you? For shame, f-o-r shame!"</p>

<p>Mabel looked up and beheld the red round visage of Dr. Pyne, with the
swarthy countenance of a stranger, peering over his shoulder. She buried
her face in her hands, while her heart grew cold with despair.</p>

<p>"Come my canary bird," cried Dr. Pyne gathering his arms tightly
around her form. "No strugglin' no screamin'&mdash;d'ye hear?"</p>

<p>He wound the dark robe more closely around her form, compressing her
hands and limbs, as within the embrace of a vice.</p>

<!-- page 387 -->

<p>"Pretty! By-Jove! Pretty!" muttered Fitz-Cowles as he unwound the
black silk scarf from his neck and tied it round her head and over her
mouth. "You've a kind pa-pa my dear, and you've treated him quite rudely.
But we'll take care of you, my love, depend upon it, we will!"</p>

<p>He raised her in his arms and bore her toward the entrance, while Dr
Pyne followed smilingly at his heels.</p>

<p>"I feel good all over!" he muttered rubbing his fat hands together.
"To think of my dear daughter returning to the parental roof! Oh, goodness
what a Consoler that thought is!"</p>

<p>"And you a poor broken-hearted father," chuckled Fitz-Cowles as he
bore the maiden through the Audience Chamber.</p>

<p>They entered the dark entry. Mabel uttered neither sigh nor moan, nor
struggled to free her limbs from the arms of Fitz-Cowles. A strange
apathy of despair had chilled her soul: she yielded to her fate like the pale
consumptive, who counts the few hours of existence on some dreary sick
bed, while every minute crumbles away a clod from the edges of the grave.</p>

<p>"To the carriage," muttered Fitz-Cowles, "To the carriage, and our
beauty is safe!"</p>

<p>The words had not passed his lips when his foot became entangled in
some dark object resting along the floor; he fell forward while Dr. Pyne
seized the maiden from his grasp.</p>

<p>"Come Fitz, we must hurry," exclaimed Pyne when he felt himself
grasped by the throat and bruised violently in the back, at the same moment.
Unloosing his grasp which pinioned the maiden's form, he howled in
very agony.</p>

<p>And then two stalwart arms grasped him by the neck, and two uncivil
feet tripped up his heels with the precision and regularity of clock-work. In
an instant Dr. Pyne felt himself rolling down the stairs; he made an effort
to stay his mad career at the first landing, but in vain! He rolled over the
landing, and then down the four and thirty stairs, like a bundle of cotton,
with bones in it, the Reverend preacher bumped and rolled and rolled and
bumped again.</p>

<p>He had lain at the foot of the stairway, for the space of a moment or more,
full of groans and aches, when a heavy body whizzed through the air, and
the Reverend Doctor felt himself hit in the paunch by the form of a full
grown man, which came bounding down the stairs with the velocity of a young
colt.</p>

<p>"Oh my God!" groaned Pyne. "Who did that?"</p>

<p>"What in the d&mdash;l d'ye mean?" roared the voice of Fitz-Cowles, "what
in the d&mdash;l d'ye mean by layin' here at the foot of the stairs for people to
break their bones over you? Hey?"</p>

<p>"And what do you mean by comin' down stairs like a flyin' fish or a
bomb shell? Curse it&mdash;there ain't a whole bone in me!"</p>

<p>At the head of the stairway in the full glare of the light streaming through

<!-- page 388 -->

the small window, stood a wild and distorted form, with thick locks of
matted hair falling aside from a hideous countenance, all a-flame with an
expression of superhuman rage.</p>

<p>Fitz-Cowles and Pyne felt the glare of a solitary eye flashing down upon
them, like the eye of a coiled snake darting from the orbless socket of a skull.</p>

<p>"Did I smash you, ye born devils?" roared the hoarse voice of Devil-Bug.
"You thought you'd steal off with the gal, and then you thought the bundle
o' blackness on the floor wasn't nothin! Ho, ho! Did I trundle the Parson
down stairs, and hit him in the paunch with the dandy? Ho, ho! I
wonders how it verks!"</p>

<p>"Come Parson, we'd better go," said Fitz-Cowles. "That incarnate fiend
seems to mix himself up with every-body's affairs. Come!"</p>

<p>"Oh, O, O-o-o! I wish he hadn't mixed <i>you</i> up with <i>me</i> so confoundedly!"</p>

<p>Groaning and aching, Parson Pyne followed Fitz-Cowles to his carriage.</p>

<p>Five minutes passed. With the cold sweat standing in thick beads on his
forehead, fresh from scenes of superhuman horror, Ravoni passed up the
stairway, his arms folded on his breast, and his dark eyes buried beneath
the interwoven brows.</p>

<p>At the head of the stairway the light from the circular window streamed
over a strange and impressive picture. A monster in human shape knelt on
the floor, with the form of a fair and beautiful girl resting unconsciously upon
his knee. His solitary eye was fixed upon her snow-white face, and his
rough hands gathered her torn robe, over her alabaster bosom. Ravoni
started, and then stood like some statue of wild and mysterious astonishment,
gazing unperceived upon the scene.</p>

<p>"Yer dead gal, yer dead," muttered the Monster, and a big tear started
from his eye. "And they tuk yo' from me, and stole yo' away and hid yo'&mdash;the
dogs and devils! Yer dead gal, but I'll buy me sich knives and pistols
to cut and slash yer enemies to pieces, that they'll wish the devil had
'em a thousand times! Oh yer dead, yer dead!"</p>

<p>His rough hand was passed over her smooth cheek, as if to wake her
gently to life again, and then he moaned in a low and broken tone, "Yer
dead gal, yes, yes, yer dead!"</p>

<p>Ravoni was touched by this strange spectacle. There was something in
the voice, the look, the manner of the Savage, that thrilled the very heart
strings of this mysterious man.</p>

<p>Ascending the last step of the stairs, he touched Devil-Bug gently on the
shoulder. "What does this mean?" he said in a low-toned voice.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug looked up with a scowl on his grim face, but it melted away
before the deep glance of Ravoni's dark eyes. Had the Sorcerer indeed
made <i>His</i> WILL, <i>the</i> SOUL of this Monster?</p>

<p>"Why yo' see," said Devil-Bug in a submissive tone, "I didn't dream
when I lay watchin' beside the door, that my pretty little Nell was the gal,
either! Not a bit of it! An' while I was watchin', in comes Parson Pyne,

<!-- page 389 -->

an' a dandy with him, an, they carries off the gal, thro' the door leadin' into
the Aud'ence Room; they brings her this way&mdash;the dogs! Didn't I rise on
'em? Didn't I pitch the Parson down stairs, with the dandy a-top of him?
Ho, ho!"</p>

<p>"And so you know the girl?" asked Ravoni with his dark eyes fixed upon
the visage of Devil-Bug.</p>

<p>"Know the gal?" exclaimed the Savage.  "I tell you she's the child of
the rich marchant; she's the daughter o' Livingstone!"</p>

<p>A sneering smile wreathed the lips of the Sorcerer.</p>

<p>"I have heard this story before. Parson Pyne told me all. The girl is
a maniac. She <i>fancies</i>&mdash;d'ye mark&mdash;she <i>fancies</i> that she is the child of
Livingstone."</p>

<p>Devil-Bug was nettled by the cold tone of Ravoni.</p>

<p>"Is them fancy?" he cried, drawing a pacquet of papers from his coarse
garment.</p>

<p>"Is them papers wot proves it all, as straight as A, B, C, is <i>them</i> fancy?
Let me put 'em in Livingstone's hands! Vonders how that 'ud verk?"</p>

<p>Ravoni leaned slowly forward, keeping the glance of his impenetrable eye
fixed upon the face of the Savage.</p>

<p>"It is all nonsense," he said in a jeering tone, and then coolly reaching
forth his hands, he took the pacquet from the grasp of Devil-Bug. "Here
is gold for you, my fellow. Leave these papers with me. I shall not want
you again, until to-morrow."</p>

<p>Devil-Bug's arms dropped by his side. The gold pieces rattled on the
floor.</p>

<p>"Look here, Man or Devil, whatever yo' are, I'm ugly as a sarpint, and
I've stole dead bodies for you, and maybe I'd murder for you, if you paid
me well, but I can't take gold for them papers! This gal's life and fortin'
an' name, is locked up there in that package! Give it to me, I say, and I'll
be yer slave for life!"</p>

<p>He lifted his huge hands beseechingly, as he spoke. His rough voice
was quivering and tremulous, as the tones of a child. Cold, calm and impenetrable
Ravoni gazed upon him, his dark eyes gleaming with those awful
rays, which were magic and power.</p>

<p>"Your object is gold," he slowly said. "You shall have it. The papers
and the girl are mine."</p>

<p>He raised the fainting form of Mabel from the knee of Devil-Bug, and with
his foot, thrust open the door of the western chamber.</p>

<p>"Begone!" he exclaimed with his hand pointing toward the stairway. "I
shall want you to-morrow&mdash;Begone slave!"</p>

<p>He disappeared within the room, and closed the door. Devil-Bug stricken
dumb with awe and astonishment rose on his feet. He moved slowly toward
the stairway.</p>

<p>"And she is to be one of his nuns!" he muttered between his teeth.

<!-- page 390 -->

"To-night she's pure as one o' God's angels&mdash;to-morrow morning she'll
be foul&mdash;<i>foul!</i> There ain't a trull along, the streets fouler than this child
will be! And yet I'm <i>his</i> slave! Ha, ha! He <i>ses</i> and I must <i>do!</i> Why
didn't he bid me tear my bare arm with my teeth? But to give my child to
him&mdash;to <i>him!</i> To lay sich a butterfly in a spider's nest! And he'll give
me gold for her&mdash;gold!"</p>

<p>It was awful to see the malignity of hell, gleaming from every line of that
distorted countenance. The solitary eye stood out from the socket, blazing
with a glaring lustre; the lips writhed and worked over the clenched teeth.
And yet whenever he thought of Ravoni, a cold chill quivered through his
deformed body. He could fight with a man, yes he could grapple with
phantoms from the grave, but Ravoni! The deep dark eyes of the Sorcerer
were forever before him, their awful rays pouring into his soul.</p>

<p>One word broke from his writhing lips.</p>

<p>"Monk-Hall!"</p>

<p>Yes, he would bury himself in the nooks and corners of the accursed mansion;
in the dim shadows of that hall of death and crime his soul would find
such comfort, as the grave-worm finds when revelling over the hollow skull.
Darkness to darkness, guilt to guilt, the ghost to its haunt, the murderer to
his den!</p>

<p>"Monk-Hall!" he muttered, and then departed from the House of Ravoni.
On one side wriggled and crawled the man with the broken jaw and lolling
tongue; on the other, the old woman glided, with the blood oozing from the
hollow skull. The groan of the man, and the sound of the woman's pattering
blood mingled together, but what were these horrors to the thought which
burnt like a hot iron through his brain? <i>His child</i> in the arms of pollution
and shame.</p>

<p>Fitz-Cowles stood beside his cream-colored carriage. The groans of the
bruised Dr. Pyne came through the open door, and the bay horses struck
their hoofs impatiently against the stones of the street. Fitz-Cowles stood
with one foot on the carriage steps, when his brow grew dark with sudden
thought. He started back upon the pavement, and stood with folded arms,
and his cane raised to his lips.</p>

<p>"All is safe!" thus ran his wandering thoughts. "This morning I sent
the 'hair trunk' and all my other baggage to New York, under an assumed
name. Public curiosity is still alive in regard to the&mdash;forgery&mdash;and yet no
one suspects me! I stand clear as the day, among the Aristocracy of the
Quaker City! Von Gelt is gone; no accomplice can now mutter treason
with regard to his master. Dim my Creole slave, has orders to have two
of the best horses to be had in this town, for love or money, ready saddled
and bridled to-night, in the wood beyond Camden. With these horses Dora
and I will escape from Hawkewood; by-the-bye she must take care to
have all her jewelry with her. I must make something by this woman;

<!-- page 391 -->

must turn her fancy for a Coronet into good Fitz-Cowles' gold. All therefore
is fair day with me, and what should I fear?"</p>

<p>"What should I fear?" he muttered aloud, and ere the words had died on
his lips, a dark Presentiment crept through his blood. "While I stand here,
this man Harvey may be laying some infernal plot to blow all my schemes
in the air! That would be a pretty spectacle! As I am about to leave the
city to-night, to feel an officer's finger on my shoulder, 'you are my prisoner,
Sir'&mdash;ugh! I have not seen Harvey to-day&mdash;this silence annoys me!
Poodle gave me a hint that Harvey was on the track of the Jew yesterday&mdash;Zounds!
Could he have seen that rascal before his&mdash;<i>death?</i>"</p>

<p>Fitz-Cowles was troubled. His lip was compressed, and his swarthy
face grew darker with a settled frown.</p>

<p>"Drive to my rooms, Parson," he whispered through the carriage door.
"I will join you there in an hour."</p>

<p>The carriage door closed on a curse which broke from the Parson's lips,
as his fat frame writhed beneath the agony of manifold bruises; and the
vehicle rattled away along the street.</p>

<p>"I will go to Monk-Hall," he muttered. "I will spy out the secrets of
the den, and if the Jew made any communication to Harvey before his
death, I will know it ere this day is gone by. Ha! Here is that fool
Mulhill!"</p>

<p>And with a smile on his red visage, the redoubtable Major Rappahannock
Mulhill came lounging lazily along the street, twirling an enormous crooked
stick in one hand, while the other was inserted in the capacious pocket of
his pantaloons.</p>

<p>The costume of the Major, you will remember was striking and peculiar&mdash;a
broad brimmed felt hat with a blue cord and tassel; a white blanket
overcoat which was thrown open in front, revealing a sky-blue coat with
metal buttons, a deep red velvet vest and a pair of pants made very full, and
striped like bed ticking. Brimstone kid gloves and patent leather boots,
completed the costume of this dashing gentleman.</p>

<p>"How do Curnel&mdash;Fine day," wobbled the Major lounging to the side of
the Millionaire. "Cussed dull town this is! Not a man shot down in the
streets to-day, I vow!"</p>

<p>"Your humble servant, Major. May I request your services in an affair
of great delicacy? I have an enemy. He has resorted to mean practices
to injure me. I have determined to put him down. In order to do this, I
must visit one of the vilest dens in the Quaker City. I want a friend to go
with me, stand by me and fight for me. Will you be that friend?"</p>

<p>"Where is the den of thieves?" drawled Mulhill with a sleepy look.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of Monk-Hall?"</p>

<p>"There's my paw," said the classic Mulhill. "But mind ye, if there
ain't a man killed I shall account the affair, low, d&mdash;&mdash;d low!"</p>

<p>"Thanks, Major, thanks," exclaimed Fitz-Cowles taking the proffered

<!-- page 392 -->

hand. "Meet me an hour from this time, at the corner of Fifth and Chestnut
Streets. Till then good bye."</p>

<p>"Da-day!" drawled Mulhill, "I will not fail you. A-<i>doo!</i>"</p>

<p>And Fitz-Cowles hurried up the street with a frown on his brow, while
Mulhill lounged in an opposite direction, with a broad grin on his red visage.
Fitz-Cowles placed his gold-headed cane to his lips, and muttered wildly to
himself, while Mulhill drew from his pocket, a slip of paper, and rattled it
against the tip of his nose with a broad grin.</p>

<p>"A love letter from a g-a-l!" he muttered, and then went laughing on
his way.</p>

<p>And at the same instant, like a Ghost walking forth in the noonday sun,
from the house of Ravoni, the form of Devil-Bug emerged into the light.</p>

<p>"Monk-Hall!" he shouted with a hideous grin, and rushed wildly down
the street.</p>

<p>Ravoni bore the maiden into the western chamber, and laid her unconscious
form, on the velvet cushions of the arm-chair, beside the table. Then
stepping backward, he contemplated her face with folded arms and a dilating
eye. Her long dark hair fell in one thick mass around her pale
countenance, and the long fringes of her eyelashes rested upon the whiteness
of her snowy cheeks. There was a sweet smile lingering on her lips;
a silent thought, a calmness and a love speaking from her pallid brow.</p>

<p>Ravoni stood gazing upon her, and even through the sallow paint which
marred the eternal manhood of his visage, you might see the warm blood
glowing and brightening with deep emotion. His dark red lip grew eloquent
with feeling; something full of passion, and yet holier than sensual love.</p>

<p>"Thou art very beautiful!" murmured Ravoni speaking in that low toned
voice, which flowed like music on the air. "And thou shalt be the Priestess
of the New Faith!"</p>

<p>Leaning gently forward he impressed a kiss upon her brow; too warm
for a father's kiss, too holy for a lover's.</p>

<p>The maiden unclosed her eyes, and murmured in a low whisper two half-audible
words, "My Father!"</p>

<p>"Girl, thou hast no father! It is all a trick, a delusion, a show. The
poor wretch who forged the note, which lured thee, to this mansion, tore
thee from the arms of father and mother, when but a babe. Thy parents
are long since dead, and thou art an orphan."</p>

<p>There was something so calm and so assured in the tones of Ravoni, that
the hopes of Mabel, broke away from her soul, like the crumbling sands before
the waves of Ocean. Her world was gone! And yet the utter desolation
of her agony was too deep for tears. Her dark eyes flashed and dilated,
and yet their glance never wandered from the eyes of Ravoni.</p>

<p>"Thou art an orphan!" he repeated, taking her white hand within his
own, and looking through her eyes, into her soul. "In this goodly Christian

<!-- page 393 -->

world thou hast had, never a friend. Thy life has been made the sport
and plaything of a hypocrite, who would have visited thy soul, with an
eternal stain. Tell me, fair girl, what are the ties that bind thee to life?"</p>

<p>"<i>Orphan!</i>" muttered Mabel in an absent tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, orphan! Another name for youth, helplessness and misery!
Orphan! A thing to be trodden upon by the oppressors of this world, to
be trampled by godly feet, crushed by pious hands. Look upon me, fair
girl, gaze in mine eyes, and mark my words. In this great world where
thou art friendless and alone, <i>I</i> will be thy friend."</p>

<p>"You!" murmured Mabel. "And will you not too, deceive and betray?"</p>

<p>"Deceive a soul like thine?" exclaimed Ravoni, with a bitter smile,
"Leave that to priests and worldlings! Could <i>I</i> deceive <i>thee?</i>"</p>

<p>He leaned gently forward, and his dark eyes shone into her soul. With
parted lips and gasping breath, Mabel gazed upon him, and murmured
"Never! Never!" There was an irresistible power in his look, his tone,
and speaking brow. She felt drawn to him, and yet it was not with passion!
It seemed to her, that she could lay forever at his feet, and listen to
the wild music of his tone, without a word or motion in reply.</p>

<p>Was the Sorcerer subduing her <i>Will</i>, with the wierd Magnetism of his
spirit? In other words, was the Man of deep and powerful intellect, silently
overshadowing her Soul, with his irresistible Will? Why does the
maiden, pure and stainless as God's angels, hang on his look and tone with
that fascination which seems more like a deep religious reverence than an
earthly love?</p>

<p>"It is from such as thee, fair girl, that the Great Father chooses his
rarest jewels! Unto such as thee, are unlocked the mysteries of the world,
the sun, the sky, the air, and of that most wonderful of all creations, the
human soul. Thou art an orphan, yet shalt thou breathe in a world, unknown
to grosser souls. Thine unsealed eyes shall gaze upon sights that
shall fill the blood with rapture, that shall make the heart undulate on waves
of music, like some angel barque, freighted with perfume, as it glides in light
and song over gently-rippling waters. Thou art an orphan, and yet in
thought and soul, thou shalt be, as one of the Seraphim who live in the sunshine
of the Father's Presence!"</p>

<p>No word from Mabel's lips, not even a sigh! Already the words of the
Sorcerer were bursting into fulfilment. While her rapt eye grew glassy
with fascination, while the tones of Ravoni fell on her ear, with the musical
murmur of green leaves dipping gently into rippling waves, a strange panorama
of beauty glided on her Soul.</p>

<p>First a soft and mellow light, then a cool lake environed by green hills;
then from a mountain's summit, she gazed upon a gorgeous sweep of forests
broken by vineyards and cities, with streams of blue water winding along
grassy plains, where marble palaces arose upon the summer air. Then she
trod the streets of an ancient city, where strange costumes and swarthy faces

<!-- page 394 -->

flitted by, while immortality looked down, from long lines of massive temples,
sublime with the triumphs of an architecture, which was reared in the
sweat and blood of millions, through the long lapse of ages.</p>

<p>Then strains of music, whose melody never stirred the chords of a harp
touched by human hands, filled her soul, and from the bowers of a green
isle, she gazed upon the calm expanse of ocean, with white clouds uprising
from the waters into the sunny sky.</p>

<p>"Wouldst thou behold the face of thy Mother?" the calm tones of Ravoni
broke on the ear of the maiden, and like a flash, her dream or vision,
call it what you will, was past and vanished.</p>

<p>She awoke to the consciousness of Ravoni's look and tone and brow.
"My mother," she exclaimed in tremulous tones, "Oh let me look upon
her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Advance to yonder mirror. Let the whole force of thy Soul be centred
upon thy Mother, whom thou hast never beheld with the eyes of sense;
advance and gaze and thine own mother, shall stand before thee!"</p>

<p>Trembling through every fibre of her young form, Mabel arose. The
Mirror reached half-way from the floor to the ceiling, in an interval of the
crimson hangings. It was but five steps forward, and yet Mabel seemed an
age in passing that trifling space. Trembling and pale, she stood before
the Mirror, afraid to gaze within its glittering frame.</p>

<p>"Look within the Mirror," exclaimed Ravoni. "What dost thou behold?"</p>

<p>"I see my own form, and I see yours&mdash;" whispered Mabel.</p>

<p>Ravoni bent his eyes to the floor, and pressed his hand on his forehead.</p>

<p>"My will shall pass into her brain," he murmured. "What dost thou
see now?"</p>

<p>"There are faint outlines as of a woman's form," slowly whispered Mabel,
"There is the gleam of two dark eyes, but all beside is mist and shadow."</p>

<p>"Thy soul is not yet firm! Think of thy mother, think earnestly, and
with thy entire soul, and lo! she will stand before thee!"</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. The Sorcerer sate by the table, with
his hand pressed against his brow, while Mabel stood before the Mirror, her
dark eyes burning with an unnatural light.</p>

<p>"Joy, joy," faintly murmured Mabel, "she comes!"</p>

<p>And like a beam of light from the bosom of a cloud, the vision stood before
her! The form of a woman, clad in light robes, with two dark eyes of unutterable
beauty, beaming from a pale face, around whose outlines, fell thick
tresses of raven hair. It was there for a moment, there within the Mirror
and then it was gone.</p>

<p>"My mother, I have seen thee!" muttered Mabel, and fell fainting into
the arms of Ravoni.</p>

<p>Her head rested upon his shoulder, and her dark hair fell waving over his
arms and hands.</p>

<p>"There are those who search the ocean for its secrets, the air for its mysteries,

<!-- page 395 -->

who devote a long life to the properties of a flower or the qualities of
a plant! Fools and madmen! Within my arms I hold a Mystery, more
hallowed than all the secrets of the earth combined. Here is a fair and stainless
woman, whose heart is full of truth, whose soul is all enthusiasm! On
this heart will I write the teachings of Ravoni; this soul shall throb with the
impulses of my Will!</p>

<p>"From this hour thou wilt begin to live, fair girl! This moment thou
art born! And with the past, let all things that remind thee of thy former
life, be buried! Thy name itself shall be forgotten in the name which I now
give thee!</p>

<p>"I baptize thee with a kiss, and whisper the name which shall dwell on
my lips in many an hour of joy, a name soft as a ripplet's murmur or a
woman's sigh, when first her cheek kindles to her lovers kiss.</p>

<p>CHAPTER EIGHTH.</p>

<p class="small">THE DEATH OF THE WHITE OWL.</p>

</div>

<p>AN old man, leaning upon spade, stood on the brow of a gentle eminence,
with the beams of the setting sun falling over his wrinkled face.</p>

<p>He stood in front of a massive gate, whose posts falling to decay, were in
strong contrast with the solidity of a thick stone wall, which extended along
the eminence, until it was lost to view in the hollows on either side.</p>

<p>Behind the wall arose a thick grove of pines, with the steep roofs and grey
walls of an old-time mansion, dimly visible through their evergreen boughs.</p>

<p>In front of the aged man lay a wild and broken tract of country, plains
of dreary sand, varied by sombre forests of pine, or here and there an orchard
of peach trees, with the bare and desolate limbs, waving stiffly in the winter
air, or a solitary farm-house rising from some bleak waste of brown earth.
The distant western horizon was one dim and dreary wall of pine forest, with
the broad disc of the setting sun, seen half above the dark barrier, while his
level beams fell with a red lustre over the wintry landscape.</p>

<p>The whole tract of country, in view of the old man, who stood on the
brow of the eminence, wild and dreary as it was in summer, was now rendered
fearful as some night-mare dream, by the absence of the scanty foliage,
which served to hide some of its most hideous features.</p>

<p>The setting sunlight streamed over the sides of steep ravines, sunken in
the bosom of the sand wastes, like colossal graves, or along the surface of
black pools of water, visible through the intervals of pine forests, or over the
side of some barren hill, which shot up suddenly from the surrounding plain,
with its bleak sides covered, with the trunks of burnt and blasted trees.</p>

<!-- page 396 -->

<p>The eye of the old man was fixed upon the road, which made one straight
track through the landscape, from the distant horizon, until it terminated at
the gate of the mansion. Frequently crossed by streams of water, or again
rising into slight eminences, this road was all one dreary path of sand. A
sight more barren can scarcely be conceived.</p>

<p>Within the compass of a mile from the spot where the old man stood, arose
three gentle hills, and on the summit of each of these, his eye was rivetted
with peculiar interest.</p>

<p>On the nearest hill a carriage was visible, drawn by two noble bay horses,
whose harness glittered in the sun.</p>

<p>On the next hill, like some enormous beetle, creeping forth from its haunts,
ere the day was done, a black and gloomy hearse, came rapidly onward.</p>

<p>On the last hill, the form of a horseman, bestriding a gallant grey steed,
rose up between the eyes and the setting sun.</p>

<p>"Man and boy, for sixty long years, I've lived on this old place, and yet
I never see'd sich a sight as that afore! For the last half hour I've watched
em, and still they come on, the carriage fust, the hearse next, and the horse
man last! An' they will drive at the same pace; the hearse keeps little over
a quarter-a-mile from the carriage, and the horseman keeps the same distance
from the hearse! Well, well, if it ain't the queerest sight, and reether
the solemn'est, I'll never strike spade into airth agin!"</p>

<p>As the old man muttered this rude soliloquy, an aged woman clad in a
petticoat of coarse linsey, hobbled through the gate, and took her place at
his side, her grey eyes dilating with wonder as she gazed upon the road
beneath.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the carriage, the hearse and the horse came hurriedly onward.</p>

<p>We will descend for a moment from our eminence at the mansion gate,
and take a glance at carriage, hearse and horse.</p>

<p>In one corner of the thickly cushioned carriage, sate a proud and peerless
woman, whose tall form enveloped in a green riding habit, was also muffled
in the warm folds of a dark cloth cloak. Her hands were folded across her
bosom, and her face drooped down, until her chin rested on her fingers.
There was a volume of thought in her full dark eye, and a strange meaning
in the steady frown which indented her queenly brow.</p>

<p>"To give up all, a Coronet and a title, for virtue and Livingstone! The
thought is galling! and yet I have given my Oath, and it shall be!"</p>

<p>As these thoughts flashed over the soul of Dora Livingstone, she leaned
slightly forward, and looked through the opened carriage window.</p>

<p>"How strange! A journey of only thirty miles, and yet it has consumed
the entire day. First the carriage breaks down&mdash;it takes the servants at
least three hours to repair the accident. Then at noon, I am overtaken by
Albert; he tells me, that the doctor has forbidden him to ride in a close carriage,
so he will follow me on horseback. Then with one delay after another,
we are detained on the road, and now as the night is coming on, we approach

<!-- page 397 -->

the old domain of Hawkewood. How singular! That hearse has followed
my carriage since noon-day. I know it's all superstition, but still I cannot
repress a shudder whenever my eye chances to fall upon that gloomy vehicle.
Yes, yes," and her thoughts resumed their original channel, "I have
given my Oath and it shall be!"</p>

<p>As she fell back on her seat, her soul became engaged again in the fearful
contest which had convulsed it during the entire day. Virtue and Livingstone,
or a Coronet and Murder!</p>

<p>Meanwhile along the brow of the next hill, the hearse drawn by a dark
horse, half concealed in sable trappings, came gloomily onward. The Driver
a man of some forty years, with a phlegmatic countenance, sate on the box,
smoking a cigar. The dark velvet hangings of the hearse, wafting slowly
aside, disclosed the coffin. It was covered with rich black cloth, and the
sunbeams glistened on the silver plate, inscribed with name and age of the
deceased.</p>

<p>The driver tossed the thick weepers aside from his face, and cracked his
whip and puffed his cigar, and the hearse rolled rapidly down the hill. A
sharp stone, projecting from the road-side, struck against one of the wheels,
and well nigh overturned the hearse in the road.</p>

<p>The driver stopped the horse, jumped from his seat. "I must see if that
'ere Mortality box ain't damaged a little!" he exclaimed, and approached the
side of the hearse. The coffin was slightly moved, and leaning within the
hearse, the driver proceeded to arrange it in its former position. While thus
occupied, he read the inscription on the silver plate of the coffin. Thus it
ran:</p>

<div class="center">

<h3>Dora Livingstone,</h3>

<p class="small">DIED, DEC., 22, 1842.</p>

<p class="small">AGED 21 YEARS, 3 MONTHS AND ONE DAY.</p>

</div>

<p>"Couzin o' his," muttered the phlegmatic driver, pointing to the distant
horseman. "Ha-hum! Died this morning 'fore daybreak; he was in a hurry
to get the plate made! Queer! Howsomdever, all I've got to do, is to
drive out to yander old place, put the coffin in an out-house, without bein'
seen, in order to spare the feelin's of relatives, and then drive back to town
agin! 'Spect the young lady made a <i>felo see</i> of herself!"</p>

<p>With this soliloquy the driver jumped on the box, puffed his cigar, and
with a crack of his whip, the hearse rolled down the hill.</p>

<p>The noble figure of the horseman and the form of the gallant grey steed
which he rode, rose up in the light of the sun, from the summit of the
last hill.</p>

<p>Pausing for a moment on the brow of the hill, the horseman bared his
brow to the setting sun. The thick corded veins stood out from the bronzed

<!-- page 398 -->

skin, and the blue eye, deep sunken beneath the dark eyebrow, glared with
an unsteady and wandering light. For a single moment as the light of the
sun shone over that face and brow, it presented a sight of fearful interest.</p>

<p>For a single moment, the muscles of the face, the veins of the forehead,
the livid lips, worked and writhed, like crawling lizards. The blue eye, so
strangely contrasted with the dark eyebrow, dilated until the pupil absorbed
nearly the entire surface of the eyeball. It was but for a moment, and then
all was calm again, but it was a calmness like sunset over the black waters
of the Dead Sea.</p>

<p>A deep husky sound like the mingling of a death rattle with cheerful
laughter, shook the broad chest of the Merchant, and then with a set smile
on his lips, he gave the rein to his steed and dashed along the road.</p>

<p>He had not gone ten paces, when another horseman, dressed in plain
black, riding a brown horse all whitened with foam, attained the summit of
the hill, and shouted to Livingstone at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>"Hello, you sir, hello!" he cried, "Can you tell me which is the way to
Hawkewood?"</p>

<p>Turning his head over his shoulder Livingstone gazed upon the stranger.</p>

<p>"Yonder building among the trees, is the place you seek," he calmly
answered.</p>

<p>"Dev'lish glad to hear it," exclaimed the stranger, who was a man of
some thirty years, with a face of no particular meaning. "Never in all my
born days, have I had sich a ride as to-day! You see Sir I landed at New
York yesterday, from the steamship, and came post haste to Philadelphia,
where I found that I'd have to ride a matter o' thirty miles before I could
see the genelman I was seekin' after. Couldn't tell me Sir, whether I'd
be sure to find Mr. Livingstone at that old place yonder?"</p>

<p>"My name is Livingstone," coolly responded the Merchant.</p>

<p>The Stranger gave a start, which he communicated to his horse by a
violent twitch at the reins.</p>

<p>"What Albert Livingstone Esq., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 'Nited States
o' 'Merica?" he shouted in a voice of unlimited astonishment.</p>

<p>"The same, Sir," replied the Merchant.</p>

<p>"Well, Sir, I'm a clerk of your father's lawyers&mdash;Messrs Billings, Smith,
&amp; Charmley, London. I'm a special Messenger Sir, sent over to see you.
There's the package Sir, that is to say, <i>My Lord</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The excited Special Messenger had thrown himself from his horse, and
hat in hand, approached the stirrups of the Merchant, holding a large pacquet,
in his hand, sealed with enormous red seals.</p>

<p>"I guess its purport," said Livingstone with a slight smile. He took the
pacquet; placed it within the breast of his overcoat, and then drew forth his
pocket-book. "Here is something, for your trouble," he exclaimed handing
the Special Messenger a roll of notes.</p>

<p>Then putting spurs to his steed, he rode forward, leaving the gentleman

<!-- page 399 -->

standing in the centre of the road; a very well executed statue of Blank
Astonishment, with its hand crammed full of paper money.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Livingstone dashed by the hearse, and speeding rapidly
forward, he reached the eminence in front of the Mansion Gate, at the same
moment that his wife stepped from the carriage. Dismounting from his
steed, the Merchant received the salutations of the servants.</p>

<p>"Welkim to Hawkewood Mister Livingstone; welkim to Hawkewood
ma'am," exclaimed the old Gardener and his wife as they hobbled forward.</p>

<p>Mrs. Livingstone greeted the old people with a cordial bow, while the
Merchant, took them each by the hand, and spoke cheerfully of the good
old times, when his father was living, and he roamed the deep woods, an
idle and free-hearted boy.</p>

<p>Livingstone now approached his wife. She stood erect in the centre of
the knoll with every outline of her magnificent form, displayed to advantage
by the green riding habit, which she wore.</p>

<p>"You have had a weary ride, my love," said Livingstone in a kind tone,
as he laid his hand upon her shoulder and gazed in her beautiful face.</p>

<p>"Such vexatious delays!" she answered with a smile, "But do tell me
Albert, where is that hearse going, that I now see, ascending the road? It
has followed the carriage, the entire afternoon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I had some conversation with the driver as I came along. It appears
that a poor girl of good family, died suddenly in a village some ten miles
beyond Hawkewood. This man is taking the coffin for her funeral, and
will stop here for a few minutes to refresh his horse. He made the request
of me, Dora, when I told him, that I was the owner of this place, and you
know," he added with a playful smile, "I couldn't refuse. The poor fellow
and his horse are <i>so</i> tired&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>As he spoke the hearse came up the hill, and while the driver sat calmly
smoking his cigar, it passed through the gate and rolled away toward the
outhouses of the mansion.</p>

<p>Dora uttered an involuntary shriek.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;the coffin!" she murmured, and turned her head away.</p>

<p>"It certainly looks very solemn," said Livingstone calmly, "and then
the plate on the top, reflects the last rays of the sun, like a mirror."</p>

<p>While the merchant's horse, the carriage and the hearse, were led or
driven toward the outbuildings of the mansion, Livingstone and his wife,
stood on the summit of the knoll gazing in silence upon the setting sun.
The aged man and woman like statues of extreme old age, leaned against
the crumbling gate posts, and gazed steadily upon the beautiful form of the
Merchant's wife.</p>

<p>"Wot a han'some couple!" muttered the old woman, "But then it's so
<i>on</i>lucky that that 'ere hearse followed the carriage!"</p>

<p>The beams of the setting sun streamed over the proud form of the Merchant,
and over the figure of his beautiful wife. Behind them lay the thick

<!-- page 400 -->

grove of pines, with the massive outlines of the old mansion, seen through
the darkening boughs. In front of them, swept the wild track of broken country,
now blending into one mass of darkness, under the gathering gloom of
twilight, while far away, the last glimpse of the sun was stealing over the
thick horizon of pine forests.</p>

<p>Dora gazed upon the scene, and felt a strange feeling of awe steal over
her soul. Turning to Livingstone, she began an observation on the thoughtful
quietude of the hour, but it died half-uttered on her lips:</p>

<p>"It is a solemn sunset, Albert&mdash;" she whispered, when she caught the
gleam of his calm, blue eye. There was something so unnatural, so fearful
in the expression that flashed from the eyes of Livingstone, that Dora felt
a thrill of horror dart through every vein.</p>

<p>"It is indeed a solemn sunset," answered Livingstone in a calm and even
tone. "But the morning will be bright, Dora, bright my love!" He turned
his head aside to conceal a frightful grimace that distorted his face.</p>

<p>The whirring of wings was heard in the air overhead. Livingstone and
his wife looked toward the zenith, in momentary curiosity.</p>

<p>"It's the old white owl," exclaimed Davidson the gardener. "You know
Mr. Livingstone, the white owl, that was old when you was a boy?"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;yes! I remember Davidson," began the Merchant, but his words
were interrupted by a whizzing noise in the air, followed by a dull sound
near his feet.</p>

<p>The bird, an enormous white owl, lay dead on the earth, between himself
and his wife. Without a shot or blow, or wound, from a clear sky it had
fallen dead. It lay with its wings out-spread, and its dying eye covered with
a glassy film.</p>

<p>"How strange!" muttered Dora, with an attempt to smile. "I hope it is
no evil omen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come my dear," interrupted Livingstone, without bestowing a glance
upon the dead bird, "The evening is cold. Let us walk toward the mansion."</p>

<p>She took his arm, and soon their figures were seen in the intervals of the
pine trees, through the dimness of the twilight.</p>

<p>Old Davidson advanced along the road, and gazed upon the dead owl.
His wrinkled cheek was pale as ashes: his aged dame stood by his side with
quivering limbs and chattering teeth.</p>

<p>"Omen," muttered the old gardener in an absent tone&mdash;"Omen"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why yes, don't ye ricoleck?" screeched the old woman. "That old
Livingstone always took sich keer o' that owl? He always feared the
prophesy that had been made some time or other, about it. He always sed
that when the old White Owl of Hawkewood died, one of the Livingstones
'ud meet with a sudden death! an' there it lays, dead as a stone!"</p>

<p>"Stuff!" muttered the old man, and yet he stood surveying the dead owl
with a look of unmingled fear. "Since you do rake up sich foolish tales
why don't yo' tell 'em right? Old Livingstone always charged me to take

<!-- page 401 -->

good keer o' the White Owl's life, for 'when that bird dies,' ses he, 'one of
the Livingstones will murder his best friend, or the wife of his bosom!' "</p>

<p>As though conscious of the words uttered by the old man, the dead owl
faintly fluttered its wings for a single moment. It was only the winter wind,
passing through the snowy feathers.</p>

<p>Livingstone and his wife stood in the doorway of the old-time mansion.
Around them lay thick shadows of twilight, and through a long avenue of
pines, extending in gloomy perspective from the hall door toward the west
they beheld the last glimpse of the expiring winter's day.</p>

<p>"Here my father made his home," exclaimed Livingstone, turning to his
wife, as they stood on the threshold of the place. "Here, escaping from the
cares of city life, he delighted to bury himself in the shadows of the dim old
halls, where the first man of our race, who trod the American shores, had
lived and ruled, in the state of an old English Baron&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your family were noble in the old world?" asked Dora, gazing upon
the sombre countenance of her husband, now half-veiled by the shadows of
twilight.</p>

<p>"Aye, noble by the lineage of a thousand years! Broad lands and stout
throngs of retainers owned their sway, when&mdash;&mdash;" a bitter smile broke over
his lips&mdash;&mdash;"A <i>woman</i> brought dishonor and murder to our house. Under
an assumed name, the last <i>Lord</i> of the race, sought the American shores,
leaving his lands in the old world, to distant kinsmen. He reared this mansion,
and lived and died within its walls. It is a long story, Dora, and a
dark one, and when I think of my father's soul, clouded by the cankering
memory of a nameless wrong, I begin to think that a hereditary taint of superstition
lingers in our blood&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Superstition?" echoed Dora.</p>

<p>"Was not my father superstitious? From brooding over the crime which
had dishonored our house, he came to walk in a world of his own, where
every object was darkened by the memory of our traditional wrong. You'd
hardly believe it, Dora, but my father indulged and cherished a wild belief,
approaching in certain respects, the old doctrine of the transmigration of
souls&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A muttered exclamation of surprise escaped from Dora, as she beheld
Livingstone's noble countenance fire with an expression of singular enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Through the treachery of a woman, ha, ha, the <i>treachery</i> of a <i>woman</i>
mark ye, the pride of our house was levelled to the dust. A wrong, terrible
as it is nameless, was done to the dearest friend of my lordly ancestor. My
father, either from some wild tradition which had descended to him with the
memory of that wrong, or from his peculiar habits of thought, believed firmly
that the spirit of this much wronged friend, hovered around our house, for
its evil and its ruin. The White Owl which fell dead at our feet to-night,

<!-- page 402 -->

enshrouded that spirit in its bosom. Ha, ha, such was my father's superstition!
For more than an hundred years, that owl, has hovered around
the roofs of Hawkewood. My father believed that within twelve hours after
its death, some awful calamity would befall our house&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A singular superstition!" exclaimed Dora, who took a strange interest
in the words of her husband. "Did the belief of your father specify the
nature of the calamity?"</p>

<p>"What a pitiable thing is human nature!" said Livingstone with a bitter
smile. "To think that a man like my father, should be the victim of such
a puerile superstition! Will you credit me Dora, when I tell you, the nature
of the calamity, which the death of this 'doom-bird' was to bring to our
house? Ha, ha, the absurdity of the thing makes me smile!"</p>

<p>"The calamity&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was this! '<i>When the White Owl of Hawkewood dies, then shall a
Livingstone crimson his hands in the blood of his wife, or receive his death
through her guilt and shame.</i>' Such is the prophecy! How absurd!"</p>

<p>"And in this prophecy your father held implicit faith?" asked Dora, with
a pale cheek and dilating eye.</p>

<p>"The night grows cold, my love," said Livingstone with a manner of
affectionate regard. "Let us enter the mansion. Yes, yes, my father was
tinctured with this ridiculous superstition, but the greatest men, have had
similar follies. C&aelig;sar had his phantom, Napoleon his star, and ha, ha, the
Heir of Hawkewood must have his Spirit, disguised as an owl!"</p>

<p>And as he crossed the threshold with a careless laugh, the gloomy hearse
rolled past the hall door toward the gate of the mansion, its uplifted drapery
disclosing the vacant space, no longer occupied by the coffin, concealed in
black cloth with a glittering plate on its bosom.</p>

<p>IT is night again, and we are once more in the Quaker City. It is the third
night of our history, and from the bosom of the darkness, which like a bird of omen,
broods over the city, forms of mist and shadow arise; they raise their hands to the
heavens, they glide along with looks of unutterable woe. Do you hear the mournful
music floating on the air? Do you see the awful frown, darkening over the
faces of these Death-Angels? For they are Death-Angels, sent forth to dip their
raven wings in blood. It is night now, but ere the morrow breaks, these ministers
of wrath, will lay down before the Throne of Fate, the souls of the slain.</p>

<p>One angel glides solemnly over the city, folding his awful wings above the
House of Ravoni.</p>

<p>Another Death-Spirit spreads his wings over the broad Delaware, and points to
the far sand plains, where a light, like a world on fire, rushes into the dark sky.</p>

other spreads his wings for the wild forest, the old-time mansion, and the plain of
sand.</p>

<p class="small">THE OUTCASTS OF THE QUAKER CITY.</p>

</div>

<p>THE Dead-Vault of Monk-Hall was illumined by the glare of lights. In
the centre of the square space, described by four massive brick pillars, stood
a large table of unpainted pine, with some dozen candles, arranged along its
surface, burning in candlesticks of rusted iron. Gusts of wind moaning
from the dim vault, flung the light with a flaring lustre, over the massy outlines
of the pillars, revealing the fragments of coffins scattered round the
floor, mingled with human bones, or sending a wild uncertain ray into the
far recesses of the cellar, where dismal nooks, yawned like graves, or the

<!-- page 404 -->

substantial masonry of the place, assumed a thousand strange and fantastic
forms.</p>

<p>Beside the table, with one huge hand resting on its boards, stood the
Doorkeeper of Monk-Hall, his head half drooped upon his broad chest, and
his solitary eye glaring down upon the oaken floor. Now and then the
wind tossed his tangled hair aside from his protuberant brow, and a single
vein, shooting up between the eyebrows, was revealed as it stood out from
the skin, like a thick cord, or the light flared over his distorted features,
giving their harsh outlines, a momentary and horrid glare.</p>

<p>"Devil-Bug&mdash;" he muttered in his hoarse, grating voice. "Yes&mdash;That's
my name! The gal's tuk for my arms, and I'll live to gather the good red
goold&mdash;&mdash;Devil-Bug 'ill be a rich man afore long! To think that Jew
should have been hid so snug, a night an' a day in the Tower Room! Didn't

help him to escape to furrin parts. Ha&mdash;h-a! Bess hid him there, did she?
And the old 'oman's will is in the chest&mdash;what a cussed fool I was! To
murder the widder for her goold, when by her will she gives it all the 'child'
of her Ellen and Marchant Livingstone, should sed child ever be found!
And that child is now in the hands of the Wizard&mdash;ugh!"</p>

<p>Devil-Bug clasped his talon fingers together, and uttered a low groan.
How the heart of the Monster clung to the child of Ellen!</p>

<p>"The Jew must be <i>done</i> fust of all: then the goold is mine!"</p>

<p>A roar of wild laughter from an adjoining cellar drowned the whispers
of the Doorkeeper.</p>

<p>"It's them!" he cried with a wild grin. "The dogs&mdash;the cut-throats&mdash;the
thieves! Ho-hoo! The Jew belongs to their band&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again his words were lost in a wild burst of laughter, and the rude
strains of the Vagabond's song, broke on the air, chanted by hoarse voices
to a quick cantering measure.</p>

<p>THE VAGABOND'S SONG.</p>

<p class="small">"A jolly band of good fellows all,<br/>

Are the Outcast Monks of old Monk-Hall!<br/>

They dance, they steal, they drink, they fight<br/>

And turn the shiny day into night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Chorus boys!" shouted a hoarse voice.</p>

<p class="small">"Raw Mon'gahaley is the g-o!<br/>

Clink your mugs with a jolly sound<br/>

Down in the vaults below, bel-ow!<br/>

Down in the vaults below the ground&mdash;<br/>

Hurrah, for the brave lads, one and all<br/>

The Outcast Monks of old Monk-Hall&mdash;<br/>

Hur-rah!"</p>

<!-- page 405 -->

<p>"That's the stuff!" exclaimed Devil-Bug approaching the massy door
of the thieves' cellar, which fashioned of stout wood, and strengthened by
bands of iron, was dimly perceptible in the light, at the distance of some
twenty paces from the table.</p>

<p>"Come out o' this!" he shouted pulling at the bolt of the door. "Come
out yo' thieves, yo' robbers, yo' devils!"</p>

<p>The door flew open, and the blaze of a warm hearth streamed into the
Dead-Vault. Devil-Bug's amiable greeting, was answered by the thunder
shout of some twenty or thirty voices.</p>

<p class="small">"Hurrah, for the brave lads one and all,<br/>

The Outcast Monks of old Monk-Hall!"</p>

<p>And through the opened door, into the Dead-Vault there poured one
breathing mass of rags and lameness, filth and crime!</p>

<p>Some forty or fifty vagabonds, men who had grown old in crime, women
whose bloated visages belied their sex, and puny children, whose distorted
faces, were stamped with cunning, came tramping through the door,
and surrounded the form of Devil-Bug, who in the midst of that motley
crowd, looked like a devil among his attendant imps.</p>

<p>These were the Outcasts of the Quaker City! In the day-time, vagabond
man and woman and child, lay quiet and snug, in the underground recesses
of Monk-Hall; in the night they stole forth from the secret passage through
the pawnbroker's shop in the adjoining street, and prowled over the city, to
beg, to rob, or perchance to murder.</p>

<p>Bleared eyes, distorted faces, shrunken limbs, these all were there. On
every side was filth and rags. The rags, indeed, were a wonder. Had
the heavens on some stormy day, rained rags, and our friends, the vagabonds
been caught in the shower, they could not have been better furnished,
with tatters, than they were now. The children's faces peeped out from a
wilderness of rags; the shrunken limbs or the stout forms of the men, were
muffled in rags, thick as the scales of a fish, and the bloated countenances
of the women, were framed in tatters. There was not one whole garment
in the entire crowd. Here was a stout burly ruffian, with the remnant of
a white overcoat, appended to the sad remains of a pair of checked trowsers,
there stood an unshaven loafer, in a blue roundabout with one tattered
sleeve, and then came a throng of women, clad in modified remnants of
petticoat night-gown and frock, ragged as an election banner after a
patriotic fight.</p>

<p>And among this haggard crowd were women, who twenty years ago had
been <i>belles</i>, in the saloons of fashion; men who had been educated by rich
and aristocratic fathers, for Lawyers, Judges, Bishops and Governors! But
the mass had been born in Misery, Baptized by Starvation, and Confirmed
at the altar of Poverty, by the good old Bishop Crime.</p>

<!-- page 406 -->

<p>Here they stood the Heathens and Outcasts of the Christian Quaker City,
rotting in misery and sin, while Bibles, sent by goodly missionary societies
were on their way, to degraded Hindoostan; here they stood, steeped to the
lips in vice, while pious preachers were hurrying over land and ocean, in order
to save the souls of naked Savages of the South Sea, or rescue freezing
Greenlanders of the polar waste, from the perils of eternal death.</p>

<p>*"Hurray for old Devil-Bug!" the shout broke from the assembled band
of vagabonds.</p>

<p class="small">[*In this scene the Author omits the various allusions in the '<i>slang</i>' peculiar to the vagabond
tribes of the Quaker City. They have a language of their own, but its repetition
in these pages, would afford no interest to the general reader.]</p>

<p>"Hush your d&mdash;&mdash;d noise!" growled Devil-Bug. "Or shall I lame two
or three of you? Anybody here that would like a leg broke or a head
smash'd?"</p>

<p>"Silence genelmen!" roared a Loafer who gloried in the name of Rusty
Jake. "The Perprieter o' this establishment has the floor!"</p>

<p>And with a solemn bow, the ruffian arranged the solitary sleeve of his
roundabout.</p>

<p>"Silence! Silence!" chorused the Vagabonds.</p>

<p>"Let the wimmen and childr'n <i>re</i>-tire," observed Devil-Bug with quiet
gravity. The bloated females, and the precocious children, obeyed the motion
of Devil-Bug's hand, in silence. They trooped through the door, into
the next cellar. The Doorkeeper stood alone with some thirty ruffians,
whose visages, would have effectively adorned the windows of a gaol; they
all wore the same coarse, unshaven, desperate look.</p>

<p>"Wot I wants to know is this," resumed Devil-Bug. "Have I been a
father to ye, ye ugly devils?"</p>

<p>"Has <i>he</i> been a father to us!" echoed Rusty Jake turning to his comrades
with a leer of astonishment. "<i>He</i> axes that 'ere questi'n! Oh my!
Hasn't he been a reg'lar daddy to us boys?"</p>

<p>"Hurray for old Devil-Bug!" Shouted the Thieves, Cut-throats and
Vagabonds. Devil-Bug hammered his fist on the table.</p>

<p>"Haven't I hid you, when the Poleese was arter you? Haven't you
had plenty of grub to eat? Have I treated you to the best Monygahaley?
I puts the quest'in to you! Haven't I treated you like genelmen?"</p>

<p>"Like Lords!" cried Rusty Jake.</p>

<p>"Like fightin' cocks!" exclaimed a thin-visaged Loafer, known as
Slippery Elm.</p>

<p>"Like pigs in swill," was the classic remark of another vagabond who
wore the upper portion of a great coat, "Or like a Bank D'rector treats the
Judges o' th' Court wot try's him!" And Pump-Handle, as the ruffian was
styled, flung up his hat in very glee.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for old Devil-Bug," chorused the mass of Vagabonds.</p>

<!-- page 407 -->

<p>"Genelmen, I wants to <i>per</i>-pound you a quest'in. Wot should be done
with the feller, who arter all my care and trouble for his sake, and for your
gineral welfare, goes and blows us to the Poleese?"</p>

<p>As Devil-Bug uttered these words, in a tone of quiet gravity, he presented
in his person and manner, a capital burlesque of some 'Godlike Senator,'
while the vagabonds, grouped around him looked like Congressmen eager
to pay their attentions to Judge Lynch.</p>

<p>One wild burst of execration arose from the band.</p>

<p>"To the d&mdash;&mdash;l with him! We'll cut his throat!"</p>

<p>"Genelmen," resumed Devil-Bug, "This 'ere Jew, Gabr'el Von Gelt is
sich a man! What shall be done with him?"</p>

<p>"Gabr'el Von Gelt!" muttered Rusty Jake striking an attitude. "I
never thought much o' that feller! Why he was above drinkin' Monygahaley
whiskey!"</p>

<p>"And he wouldn't eat pork!"</p>

<p>"And he was too proud to go ragged!"</p>

<p>There was a great excitement. The ruffians murmured together, and
their rude hands drew forth knives and pistols, from the thick concealment
of their rags.</p>

<p>"What shall be done with him?" was the quiet demand of Devil-Bug.</p>

<p>The answer of Rusty Jake was terse and pointed.</p>

<p>"It's my opinion vich I entertains, in common these genelmen, that this
'ere Jew's wizand ought to be examined!"</p>

<p>He passed his hand across his throat, in a gesture at once graceful and
expressive.</p>

<p>"Cut his throat!" was the response of the Outcasts.</p>

<p>"Hark! There's his footstep on the stairs," exclaimed Devil-Bug.
"He's comin' down! A word with yo' fellers. I must go up stairs a minnit&mdash;don't
do anything with the Jew till I get back! I'll bring you some
rare Monygahaley! I must get 'em drunk afore they murder the Jew!" he
muttered. "Nothin' like rum to sharpen a cut-throat's knife!"</p>

<p>As he disappeared in the direction of the western door of the vault, the
sound of footsteps grew louder in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>"It's the Jew!" muttered Rusty Jake, and as he spoke a murmur of surprise
ran through the ruffian band. A tall figure, clad from head to foot in
rags, stepped from the shadow of a brick pillar and advanced toward the
table. His hair and whiskers made him resemble a Walking Conflagration;
they were thick, bushy and burning red. His skin was hideously freckled,
and from beneath his red eyebrows, flashed the glance of two snake-like
eyes, giving his face, a strange and wild expression.</p>

<p>"Hello, comrades!" growled Rusty Jake, "Who's this feller?"</p>

<p>"Vy you see," said the Stranger with a genuine vagabond snuffle, "I'm
a feller bein' in distress. The poleese is arter me. I wants you to hide
me, old boy. Cover me up snug, will you!"</p>

<!-- page 408 -->

<p>A murmur of suspicion ran through the band.</p>

<p>"The watch-word if you please, Stranger!" asked Rusty Jake.</p>

<p>"O' course," calmly responded the red-haired vagabond. " '<i>Pork and
beans is a werry good dinner, 'specially with molasses</i>.' My name is
Brick-Top gemmen. My daddy was a scavenger, and my mammy
sold rags&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The outcasts looked upon him in suspicious wonder, and then huddling
in a group, murmured together.</p>

<p>"I must obtain the papers from the Jew or die!" was the whispered remark
of Brick-Top as he stood beside the table. "For a night and a day
I have lain, half-bruised to death, in my room up stairs. But a few moments
ago disguised in these old rags, I escaped from the front door of
Monk-Hall, passed thro' the pawnbroker's shop, and here I am, in the power
of a band of reckless cut-throats. I must watch the course of events;
the Jew is concealed somewhere, in the old mansion; I will find out his
hiding place and obtain the papers, or forfeit my life&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You sir, it's all right," exclaimed Rusty Jake. "The 'nitiation fee if you
please."</p>

<p>"Heaven grant that Dora may show Livingstone the note which I gave
her last night!" muttered the disguised Luke. "And then Mabel&mdash;&mdash;mystery
accumulates on mystery! The girl is Livingstone's child, I must save
her from ruin&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The 'nitiation fee&mdash;" growled Slippery Elm.</p>

<p>"There's a shiner," snuffled Luke in his Brick-Top voice. "I'll fork up
reg'lar if you hide me away&mdash;I will that!"</p>

<p>"Hello, fellers," exclaimed Slippery Elm, "He's given Rusty Jake a rale
yaller boy! Now boys, we'll have the grub and the likker&mdash;huzza!"</p>

<p>"I say my coves," exclaimed Rusty Jake, as fingering the gold Eagle
he glanced aside at the form of Brick-Top. "Ain't he ragged! My stars!
Why he's reg'lar nasty! What's the poleese arter you for?"</p>

<p>"Robbin' a market wagon," answered Brick-Top in a surly tone.</p>

<p>"Oh you werry contemptible individual!" exclaimed Rusty Jake, "Robbin'
a market wagon! Wot low business! Turn him out."</p>

<p>"Robbin' a market wagon!" echoed the band. "Ugh&mdash;quite a loafer!"</p>

<p>Brick-Top squared his elbows, and looked around with a threatening scowl.</p>

<p>"What the d&mdash;l you growlin' at? I've murdered my man in my time:
been convicted; sentenced for it too. I'm no new hand at the bellows, I
tell you!"</p>

<p>"That's somethin like!" exclaimed Slippery Elm. "Good, capital!"
echoed the band.</p>

<p>"You were sentenced were you?" quoth Rusty Jake. "How did yo' git
clear?"</p>

<p>"Well, you're a nice 'un!" exclaimed Brick top with a sneer. "You are
a precious fool! To axe me sich a questi'n! <i>Why the Governor pardoned
me of course!</i>"</p>

<!-- page 409 -->

<p>"Why so he did me!" cried Rusty Jake.</p>

<p>"And so he did me!" exclaimed Slippery Elm.</p>

<p>"And me!" shouted Pump-Handle.</p>

<p>"And me!" cried another ruffian.</p>

<p>"And me, by hokey!" added an unshaven vagabond.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the Pardenin' Power," chorused the rest of the band.</p>

<p>It was now Brick-Top's turn to ask questions.</p>

<p>"What were you tried for?" he exclaimed, turning to Rusty Jake.</p>

<p>"I had a misfortin'," responded the worthy. "I killed a man by accident.
You see, it was on the highway, at night. I axed him a civil question. He
replied with impudence. We had words. His wizand was perforated."</p>

<p>"What was your question?" growled Luke.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothin' pertik'ler!" meekly replied Rusty Jake. "I merely axed
him for his purse, or&mdash;his life. He wouldn't give the fust, so I tuk the last.
But&mdash;" he added with a grin, "I found <i>mercy</i>. I was pardoned!"</p>

<p>"You found <i>money</i> you mean," exclaimed Brick-Top, "and what were
<i>you</i> tried for?" he asked, turning to another vagabond.</p>

<p>"Why you see, a party of us one Sunday arternoon, had nothin' to do, so
we got up a nigger riot. We have them things in Phil'delphy, once or twice
a year, you know? I helped to burn a nigger church, two orphans' asylums
and a school-house. And happenin' to have a pump-handle in my
hand, I aksedentally hit an old nigger on the head. Konsekance wos he
died. That's why they call me Pump-Handle."</p>

<p>"And you was tried for this little accident?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I was. Convicted, too. Sentenced, in the bargain. But the
Judge and the jury and the lawyers, on both sides, signed a paper to the
Governor. He pardoned me. But I couldn't keep my hands in the ways
o' virtue, so here I am agin, hidin' from the poleese!"</p>

<p>Rusty Jake looked around with an expression of deep thought.</p>

<p>"I say fellers, why couldn't we have a Governor that 'ud <i>weto</i> the Poleese?"</p>

<p>"Hurray for a Governor that 'ud weto the poleese, and the Judges and
the Courts!" Slippery Elm sprang from his feet with excitement as he
uttered this remarkable sentiment.</p>

<p>Rusty Jake had been a small politician in his time. Two years past he
had been an influential party man, on a limited scale. In procuring forged
naturalization papers for verdant foreigners, or in swearing native paupers
and thieves into the inestimable knowledge of voting, he was alike efficient
and skillful.</p>

<p>Rusty Jake had also been a speech-maker; he had stirred up the patriotism
of the people with the cry of 'Down with the Bank,' or 'Up with the
Bank' as the humor seized him, or as he was paid for his services, by more
magnificent politicians. Rusty Jake, therefore had grown into the habit of
speech-making; he could not let the present opportunity pass, without a few
improving remarks.</p>

<!-- page 410 -->

<p>"Genelmen, feller citizens, freemen!" he shouted, ascending the table, and
gazing upon the assembled crowd of ruffians.</p>

<p>"Wot was it that our forefathers fit, bled and died for? Wot did they
go in the cold for, without a mint-julip to make 'em jolly, or a sherry cobbler
to warm their insides? Was it to have <i>this</i> item o' human rights wiped off
the slate o' liberty, with the sponge o' tyranny? Was it to have the Pardenin'
Power struck out o' th' Constitooshun? The id<i>ee</i> is redikulus! Why
the fact is, tho' it ain't ginerally known&mdash;&mdash;that the whole Revolution was
on account of the Pardenin' power! Gineral Washington&mdash;as history will
tell you&mdash;was put in jail, for killin' an injin in a nigger riot down South!
That old curmudgeon, George the Third, refused to pardon Gineral Washington.
The Revolution, gentlemen, wos the konsekence o' that refusal! I
refers you to history, gentlemen, for further pertik'lers."</p>

<p>*"Genelmen, feller citizens," shouted Slippery Elm, "Three cheers for
the Governor, wot pardons everybody, for doin' everything, and don't axe
no quest'ins! Huzza!"</p>

<p class="small">[*The last day of the administration of a certain Governor, will long be remembered
with pious reverence, by the turnkeys of the various prisons. On that day, the merciful
executive, filled up the measure of his fame, by setting free a batch of convicts, thieves,
burglars and murderers. In the course of six years, this truly merciful Executive granted
about 700 pardons.]</p>

<p>The loud hurrah of the vagabonds was interrupted by the footstep and
voice of Devil-Bug, who now appeared from the shadow of a brick pillar,
holding a large earthen jug in his hand.</p>

<p>"Will you hush that cussed noise?" he thundered in his growling voice.
"Here's the Monygahaley boys. Pass it round. D'ye know fellers, that
Von Gelt is comin' down stairs? Hello! Brick-Top here!"</p>

<p>He started as he perceived the form of his pretended accomplice.</p>

<p>"You see the poleese is arter me&mdash;" began Luke.</p>

<p>"H-u-s-h! These fellers mustn't know nothin!" muttered Devil-Bug.
"That Jew Von Gelt has been betrayin' us. He must die. You must
help despatch him, and I," he muttered this sentence to himself, "Will see
to you, and so git rid of both my partners! The Jew must die," he cried
turning to the vagabond crew.</p>

<p>"How?" asked Slippery Elm.</p>

<p>"You see this square table? It stands upon a trap. Let the Jew set
down on a bench at this side, and let one of our fellers, set down on a bench
opposite. S'pose he begins to talk to the Jew, and gits him drinkin'? A
single kick from the man's foot, will strike this knob, sink the trap, and
send our pork-hater to the devil! D'ye see it boys?"</p>

<p>Rusty Jake and the other vagabonds examined the knob, which arose
from the floor, near one of the massive legs of the table, with a quiet and
peculiar attention.</p>

<p>"What 'ill become o' th' feller who sinks the trap?" asked Slippery Elm.</p>

<!-- page 411 -->

<p>"You'll obs<i>a</i>-rve that the bench on which he is to set, is some inches
away from the edge of the trap," exclaimed Devil-Bug, "While the bench
on the other side of the table, is right in the middle o' the cons<i>a</i>rn!"</p>

<p>"Death to the traitor," muttered the vagabonds, as the earthen jug passed
from hand to hand, "Death to the Pork-hater!"</p>

<p>"But who'll be the feller to stamp upon the knob?" exclaimed Devil-Bug.</p>

<p>"Let's pull straws for it!" cried Rusty Jake, "This is capital Monygahaley!
Put a lot o' straws into a hat, and the man as has the shortest
does the thing."</p>

<p>"Agreed, agreed!" echoed the ruffians, whose sparkling eyes, betrayed the
effects of the Monongahela.</p>

<p>"Here's a decent hat to put the straws in," exclaimed Slippery Elm, producing
a piece of dark felt, which in remote ages, might have been a hat.</p>

<p>"And here's the straws," cried Rusty Jake, seizing a handful of loose
straw from the floor near a brick pillar, he proceeded to sever it into various
pieces, with a knife which he drew from his rags. These pieces, numbering
thirty-four in all, were poured into the fragment of a hat, which was placed
on the end of the table.</p>

<p>There was a dead silence. One by one, with the same look of stolid indifference,
each thief, cut-throat and robber advanced, each turned away his
face as he placed his hand in the hat, and then seizing one of the straws
from the mass, walked silently away.</p>

<p>Luke Harvey's turn came last.</p>

<p>"This grows interesting!" he muttered as he approached the table.</p>

<p>"Heaven grant that the lot may fall on any one, but me! Here I am in
a pretty 'pickle!' A candidate for the Honorable office of Executioner for
a Jew! However, here goes&mdash;&mdash;" he placed his hand in the hat&mdash;&mdash;"My
fate is decided one way or the other."</p>

<p>"Fellers measure your straws!" exclaimed Devil-Bug with quiet dignity.</p>

<p>They all grouped together: thirty-four rude hands, with the white hand
of Luke among them, were ranged in a row; there was a pause; you could
hear each man gasping for breath, and then a loud laugh broke on the air.</p>

<p>"Mister with the red beard, yours is the shortest!" exclaimed Devil-Bug.
"The job is for you!"</p>

<p>For a moment Luke stood stricken dumb with a strange fear. He must
either murder or be murdered! The eye of Devil-Bug was fixed upon him;
all hope of escape was in vain.</p>

<p>"I will procure the pacquet at all hazards!" muttered Luke with set teeth.
And he confirmed his resolution by a solemn Oath.</p>

<p>"Here comes the cripple," cried Devil-Bug. "Ho, ho" he murmured&mdash;"The
chest o' gold and other leetle property is mine!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, a shuffling footstep was heard, and the light presently shone
upon the large face and distorted body of the Jewish dwarf, Gabriel Von

<!-- page 412 -->

Gelt. He came forward with one hand resting upon his fragment of a chest,
while his dark eyes glanced around with an expression full of inquiry.</p>

<p>"Well folksh good eveningsh!" he said blandly. "I vonders vot they
means by looking plack at me?" he muttered to himself. "Folksh I shay,
good eveningsh!"</p>

<p>The vagabonds turned away from him with evident signs of disgust.</p>

<p>"The fact is my friend," cried Rusty Jake with a sneer, "There's been
reports of a wery injurious natur' circulatin' in these parts lately, in regard
to your karacter!"</p>

<p>"Brick-Top wants to speak a word with you, in regard to <i>your escape</i>&mdash;"
said Devil-Bug in a friendly whisper. "Don't mind these cut-throats&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sit down there, if you please," said Luke in a surly tone.</p>

<p>Von Gelt sate down on one side of the table, while Luke seated himself
opposite.</p>

<p>The thieves retired a few paces from the table, and Devil-Bug leaning
against a brick pillar, silently observed the scene.</p>

<p>A trifling fact may be recorded in this place. Right over the head of the
Jew, the arching ceiling descended in a point, with a substantial pulley of
iron inserted in the rude plastering. The original object of this pulley
was evident. A thick rope passed through the pulley, dropped down into
the Pit of Monk-Hall through the trap-door, lowering or raising the hogsheads
of rich old wine, which were formerly deposited in that vast cellar. At the
present moment, the light from the table, shone upon a slight but strong cord
which, arranged in a slip-knot right over the head of the Jew, was passed
through the pulley, and along the ceiling, until it hung in loose coils around
a stout iron hook, projecting from a massy brick pillar.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug stood beside this pillar, watching the rope, and the Jew with
evident interest.</p>

<p>Luke Harvey leaned over the pine table, until his face well-nigh touched
the countenance of Gabriel Von Gelt.</p>

<p>"I have ten words to say to you," he exclaimed in his natural voice.
"On your answer to these ten words hangs your life. Make but a start,
show but a sign of emotion, and you are a dead man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fader Moses! Vat is dis!" Von Gelt's florid countenance grew pale
as ashes. The slip-knot above his head began slowly to descend, as Devil-Bug
touched the other end of the rope.</p>

<p>"Don't you see by the looks of this band, that they have resolved&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"On what&mdash;" The slip-knot dangled in the air within three inches of
the Jew's head.</p>

<p>"On your murder!"</p>

<p>"Fader Abraham!" cried Von Gelt with a start, and his dark hair brushed
against the quivering rope.</p>

<p>"Start one step," whispered Luke, "and I will stamp upon the spring
which sets <i>the trap</i> in motion! Your life is in danger: I alone can save
you, I alone can rescue you from the power of these devils!"</p>

<!-- page 413 -->

<p>"Den you are not von of dem?" faltered the Jew. "Supposh I betraysh you?"</p>

<p>"Give but a sign of such a purpose, and, ha, ha, the trap <i>beneath the
table</i>, falls!"</p>

<p>"Hurry there you feller, with the red head," exclaimed Devil-Bug,
"Finish this little business!"</p>

<p>"Little bushinesh!" echoed the thunder-struck Jew.</p>

<p>Luke leaned gently forward, and fixing his eyes on the terrified countenance
of the Jew, whispered a single name:</p>

<p>" '<i>Ellis Mortimer!</i>' "</p>

<p>"Veres you hear dat name?" cried the Jew with another start.</p>

<p>"You were concerned in the great forgery, committed on the House of
Livingstone, Harvey &amp; Co., about a month since. You have about your
person certain documents which will convict Algernon Fitz-Cowles of the
forgery. Give me those documents, and the ten thousand dollars which you
have about your person, are yours! As for the '<i>murder</i>,' you can turn
'State's Evidence;' it will just suit you, being a Jew. Give me the papers!"</p>

<p>"I vill die first!" muttered Gabriel, trembling in every limb.</p>

<p>"Then by heaven, I spring the trap!" Luke hissed the whisper in his ear.</p>

<p>"I conshents!" cried Gabriel. "Dere's de pacquet!"</p>

<p>Luke grasped the prize, and buried it among his rags.</p>

<p>"I say red-head, what are yo' up to there?" growled Devil-Bug, as he
gave the rope another shake. "Be quick, I say!"</p>

<p>A growling murmur arose from the band of thieves. Luke saw that no
time was to be lost.</p>

<p>"I say Gabriel, can you run or fight?" he whispered. "If you can run
yonder's the door! I fight myself!"</p>

<p>Gabriel was rising from his feet with a look of horror and fright stamped
on every line of his face, when Devil-Bug strode silently forward at his back.
He extended his huge hand, and the slip-knot encircled the neck of the Jew.
Gabriel felt the cord around his neck, he sprang forward in horror, and as
he sprang, the massive foot of Devil-Bug was stamped upon the knob. The
trap, the tables, and the candles fell, and ere a moment all was darkness.
In that single moment of light and horror, Luke Harvey, starting back from
the edge of the chasm, beheld a sight that he might never forget. He beheld
the Jew struggling in the air, above the blackness of the void, he saw the rope
which tightened round his neck at every struggle, and like some horrible
vision, that large face, with red skin turning to purple and the mouth agape
and the dark eyes bulging from their sockets, rushed before him! A single
moment he beheld that sight, and all was darkness.</p>

<p>The wild yell of Devil-Bug mingled with the hurrah of the out-casts.
Then a choking groan gurgled from the darkness above the trap-door. Then
the sharp sound of a rope snapping, strand by strand, and then another
gurgling groan!</p>

<p>"He dies hard!" muttered Devil-Bug through the darkness.</p>

<!-- page 414 -->

<p>A light flashed suddenly over the vault, from the western entrance. Luke
looked for the corse of the Jew, quivering in the air. It was gone! The
rope broken off near the ceiling, waved gently to and fro, and a dead whizzing
sound came up from the depths of the pit, like the echo of a heavy body,
dashing into fragments against the hard earth.</p>

<p>While Luke's heart quivered with a strange horror, he looked toward the
western entrance, and saw the huge forms of Musquito and Glow-worm advancing
with torches in their hands, while two paces before them, a figure
muffled in the thick folds of a sweeping black cloak rushed hurriedly onward,
leading the way toward the trap. Luke knew the stranger at a glance;
he looked upon him for a single moment, and then silently drew two pistols
from among his rags.</p>

<p>"Devil-Bug you are betrayed!" shouted the stranger, as he stood in the
glare of the light, beside the trap-door. "Yonder stands the traitor!"</p>

<p>"Ha! Fitz-Cowles!" muttered Devil-Bug, and for a moment, as a wild
frown darkened over his brow, he seemed hesitating on whom to spring,
Luke Harvey or the Forger.</p>

<p>"Seize him!" cried Fitz-Cowles as a dark scowl impressed his swarthy
countenance, with the malignity of a devil. "He has betrayed your secrets
and your lives!"</p>

<p>"Come on my civet cat!" sneered Luke, dashing aside his red wig and
beard, as he stood with a pistol extended in either hand. "I'll sweeten you
with a new perfume! The smell of powder!"</p>

<p>The thieves drew their knives and pistols, and silently circled round Luke
Harvey and his antagonist. It was a striking picture. The tall form of
Luke, clad in rags, standing on one side of the chasm, each hand grasping
a pistol; the well-proportioned figure of Fitz-Cowles, with a cloak falling
from his shoulder, on the other, his raised arm, flashing a bowie knife in the
light; while at the head of the pit stood the deformed savage, Devil-Bug, with
his band of outcasts, circling in the background. For a moment the savage
held his bloodhounds in check.</p>

<p>"Upon him, the dog! Upon him!" shouted Devil-Bug, pointing to Luke.</p>

<p>With one movement the ruffian band advanced, their upraised knives glittering
in the torch-light.</p>

<p>"I will die hard I tell you!" said Luke, with set teeth, as he placed his
back against a pillar. "Come on blood-hounds! Come on, forger and
knave! Lay but a hand on me, and your brains shall plaster these cellar
walls!"</p>

<p>"Hew him down you dogs!" screamed Fitz-Cowles, hoarse with rage.</p>

<p>There was a quiet determination in the eyes of Luke, that for a moment
held the vagabonds in awe. It was a brave sight; one man against thirty-four
ruffians, with a well-dressed bravo, hallooing them on to a deed of cowardice
and blood.</p>

<p>Forming a half-circle the thieves advanced, slowly and silently, while

<!-- page 415 -->

Devil-Bug stole behind the pillar. There was the report of a pistol, and thick
clouds of smoke rolled to the ceiling of the vault.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha," screamed Luke, "I told you that I would die hard!" And the
form of a grim vagabond lay quivering and sprawling on the verge of the
chasm.</p>

<p>At this moment, a rough hand came gliding round the pillar; its talon
fingers encircled the neck of Luke with a grasp like death, while the whole
band of outcasts, rushed upon him with one sudden spring. Another instant
passed! He lay on the floor, with the knives of the outcasts flashing above
him, the knee of Devil-Bug on his breast, and the hands of the monster
tightening round his throat.</p>

<p>"The peril is past!" shouted Fitz-Cowles from the other side of the chasm.
"Another throw of fortune's dice, and I am saved!"</p>

<p>A puffy face, adorned by a curly wig, was thrust from behind the pillar
at his back.</p>

<p>"Here's a family party, <i>ce la est un partie domestique</i>, as we say in very
Domestic French! I tried to sell Fitz-Cowles to Harvey: he wouldn't buy
me! So I wormed what secrets I could concerning Harvey, out of the police,
and incontinently sold him to Fitz-Cowles! 'WE' is always on hand when
'black mail' is to be had!"</p>

<p>With this half-murmured remark, little Poodle drew his bewigged head
behind the pillar again.</p>

<p>"Why there's rather a muss here, my feller!" said a cheerful voice at
the shoulder of Fitz-Cowles. The Millionaire turned, and beheld the round,
visage of Major Mulhill, appearing between the wooly heads of the Negroes,
who stood holding the torches at his back.</p>

<p>"Yes, y-e-s!" whispered Fitz-Cowles, "I've the scoundrel safe! Safe at
last! Into the pit with him Devil-Bug!"</p>

<p>A deep groan came from Luke's lips as he felt himself slowly dragged
along the floor toward the chasm.</p>

<p>"I vonders how <i>that</i> 'ill vork!" chuckled old Devil-Bug. Two outcasts
held the feet of the pinioned man, while the others were grouped around
gazing silently upon the scene.</p>

<p>At this moment, the torch-light flickering fitfully along the corners of the
vault, gave the rude walls, the nooks, and crevices of the place a wild and
fantastic appearance. For an instant, it seemed to Fitz-Cowles, that the
dim shadows assumed the forms of men skulking in the darkness of the place.</p>

<p>Luke groaned in agony. His feet dangled over the chasm.</p>

<p>"Ex-cuse me, Curnel, if I admire the pattern o' your cravat," said the
redoubtable Major Mulhill, fingering the dark scarf of Fitz-Cowles with a
playful air. "Quite genteel! Does it fit tight round your neck?" He
inserted his fingers between the cravat and the neck as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Take care; you'll choke me&mdash;" muttered Fitz-Cowles with a start. A
bland smile broke over Mulhill's fat face.</p>

<!-- page 416 -->

<p>"Now my gemmen, will you read <i>this!</i>" He tightened his grasp around
the throat of the Forger, and displayed a broad slip of paper, before his very
eyes. " 'It's only a love letter from a ga-l!' "</p>

<p>"What does this mean&mdash;" gasped Fitz-Cowles, "Hands off&mdash;" His words
were drowned by a wild shriek, that quivered through the cellar.</p>

<p>"Seize him, seize the murderer of Paul Western!" shrieked a woman's
voice, and the queenly form of Long-haired Bess stood on the verge of the
chasm, her dark hair, showering aside from her pale face, and her black eye,
flashing with a glance like madness.</p>

<p>There was a moment of terrible and confused action! Devil-Bug started
up from his victim, leaving his form trembling on the verge of the pit, and
with him, the vagabond band drew their knives, and turned to face the new-comer.
One wild murmur of despair quivered from lip to lip! By the side
of every cut-throat there stood the form of a burly police officer, at the back
of Bess, along the cellar, around Fitz-Cowles and Mulhill, circled a firm and
determined band, some hundred strong, with maces and pistols in their hands.</p>

<p>"Fight ye devils!" screamed Devil-Bug, but the band of police suddenly
advanced, surrounding the thieves, and compressing them in one mass, by
the superiority of their numbers. In a moment the thieves were disarmed,
and beaten to the floor with maces. Devil-Bug clenched his weaponless
hands, and gnashed his teeth, in the effort to bite the feet that trampled him
down, but it was in vain!</p>

<p>As he lay trodden beneath the feet of some dozen police officers, Luke
Harvey, sprang over the chasm with one bound, and seized Fitz-Cowles by
the throat. The forger was deathly pale; his under lip quivered like a dry
leaf in the wind.</p>

<p>"Now coward, the hour of reckoning has come!" Fitz-Cowles lay on
the floor, with the foot of Luke Harvey on his breast. "Do you know those
papers," shrieked Luke. "Ha, ha, ha! Do you feel yourself, within the
prison's walls already? Do your dapper limbs already feel the cheering
warmth of the convict's dress&mdash;and then the manacles, and the lash! Ho, ho!"</p>

<p>"This is wot I calls a cheerin' scene," was the smiling remark of Mulhill.</p>

<p>The sound of a woman's voice, tremulous with remorse and agony, shrieked
through the dead-vault.</p>

<p>"He stands before me!" shrieked Long-haired Bess, gazing with starting
eyes, into the blackness of the chasm. "He stands before me, his pale face
clotted with drops of blood! He wronged me, and he died&mdash;&mdash;oh, God!
his dying shriek rings in my ears! But he shall be avenged!"</p>

<p>"The gallows for me, you hell-cat!" screamed Devil-Bug, raising his
head from the floor, while a fiendish grin convulsed his face. "The gallows
for me; you hell-cat!" He shook his manacled hands together "Ha, ha,
hoo! Vonders how that 'ill vork!"</p>

<p>CHAPTER SECOND.</p>

<p class="small">THE OAK CHAMBER OF HAWKEWOOD.</p>

<p class="small">DORA LIVINGSTONE GAINS THE CORONET, FOR WHICH SHE PERILLED HER SOUL.</p>

</div>

<p>"A FINE old-time mansion, Dora!" exclaimed Livingstone as he crossed
the threshold of the chamber. "That was a solemn hall thro' which we
passed, with its gloomy pictures and quaint carvings in dark stone, and then
the stairway Dora, with its steps of massive oak&mdash;by my life, I like this
mansion of Hawkewood! It has a wild baronial look."</p>

<p>"And this chamber, with its old-time furniture and antiquarian appointments,"
exclaimed Dora with a smile, "Has it a characteristic name?"</p>

<p>"It is called the Oak Chamber of Hawkewood. You see, the walls are
concealed by huge panels of dark oaken wainscot, and the floor is covered
by an old-fashioned carpet. In yonder corner, stands a bed with dark purple
hangings, and here, from this lordly hearth, the glare of a cheerful
wood fire flashes round the place. I like it Dora!"</p>

<p>"And then this round table, of dark walnut, standing in the centre of the
room, with a Gothic arm-chair on either side! Certainly the place looks
like the den of some old monk, half wizard, half antiquary!"</p>

<p>"In that chair my father breathed his last," whispered Livingstone with
a sudden sternness of tone. "And on that table words have been written,
which were followed by deeds of bloodshed and horror!"</p>

<p>With a kind gesture he pointed to the arm-chair on one side of the round
table, motioning his wife to a seat, while he sat down on the opposite side.</p>

<p>"We'll have a cup of coffee, before you change your travelling dress my
love," said Livingstone with marked kindness of tone. "I forgot to inform
you, that by a careless mistake, I dated the invitations to our friends, for to-morrow,
instead of to-day. You will have to endure the solitude of this
place, until the morning, when old Hawkewood will put on a face of smiles.
By-the-bye, my dear, I have despatched all the servants to town, in order
that my various preparations for the Christmas festival, may be completed.
Old Davidson and his wife, will wait on you, until the morrow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was something so natural and commonplace in all this, that Dora
forgot the strange wildness of manner, which Livingstone had once or twice
manifested within the past hour; and her own dark thoughts, were for the
moment, silenced by his calm tone and composed look.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha," cried Dora, with a laughing smile, "I can endure the solitude
of Hawkewood for a single night, unless, indeed, yon bed, with its gloomy
hangings, should chance to be haunted by pale ghosts or hideous dreams."</p>

<p>"Oh, your dreams will be sweet and undisturbed. I pledge my life for

<!-- page 418 -->

it!" said Livingstone, with a peculiar look, which escaped the eye of
his wife.</p>

<p>There was a knocking at the door, and in a moment, the trembling form
of the old gardener entered the chamber. His long and slender arms, embraced
a shapeless mass of canvass, entwined with thick ropes, and looking
for all the world, like the sails of a vessel, tied confusedly together.</p>

<p>"Squire whar shall I put this bundle?" exclaimed Davidson. "It looks
amazin' big, but it ain't so heavy as you'd think."</p>

<p>"What have we here?" exclaimed Dora, looking at her husband with a
glance of wonder.</p>

<p>"Only the scenery for our private theatricals," said Livingstone in a
careless tone. "You may as well stand it against the wall, behind the bed,
Davidson. To-morrow we'll have it unpacked. And now my old boy," he
added placing his hand familiarly on the gardener's shoulder. "Tell your
dame, to make one of her best cups of coffee, for myself, and Mrs. Livingstone.
Don't you remember Davidson, how fond I used to be of your
wife's coffee?"</p>

<p>"And I will say," cried the old man rubbing his hands together, "That
my Hannah's <i>ee</i>-kal in the way o' makin' coffee, and right strong coffee,
with good cream to make it look yaller as goold, an' a lump o' loaf sugar,
to give it a taste o' sweetenin' ain't to be found in these parts!"</p>

<p>With this remarkable tribute to Dame Hannah's abilities, the old gardener
left the room, and Livingstone and his wife were alone once more.</p>

<p>From the broad hearth, the crackling hickory fire, sent a ruddy glow
around the room, which now obscured the light of the wax candles, standing
on the round table, or again, dying suddenly away, left the place involved
in comparative gloom.</p>

<p>Gazing steadily in the face of his wife, Livingstone sat on one side of the
table, his broad chest, enveloped in a dark frock coat, presenting a fine contrast
to the form of Dora, whose every outline of beauty and grace, was
disclosed by the folds of her dark green travelling habit. They sat in the
centre of that strange old room, with the dark wainscot of the walls, the
heavy curtaining of the bed, the massive frames of the windows, looking to
the east, half-concealed by sombre hangings, and the spacious outlines of
the fire-place, affording the effective details of a picture, in which the form
of the merchant and his wife, were the striking and central objects of
attention.</p>

<p>The face of the merchant was deadly pale, yet an expression of immoveable
calmness lingered on every feature. The massive brow, towering
above the dark eyebrows, was full of silent thought, and the slight smile,
playing round the expressive mouth, gave his face a mild and benignant
look, which was in fearful contrast, with the discolored circles of flesh, beneath
each eye, or the sunken outlines of each bronzed cheek. The eyes
of Livingstone, wore a look, never to be forgotten. Large, azure and calm,

<!-- page 419 -->

they shone in a strange light, which seemed to flicker around each eyeball
like rays around a lamp.</p>

<p>Her form flung back in the arm-chair, in a position of grace and ease
Dora's face, afforded a vivid contrast to the countenance of her husband.
The dark eyes swam in a mild, melting light, the smiling cheeks were flushed
with warm rich hues, the high forehead was full of soul, and the small
mouth with its lips of deep voluptuous red, was curved in a winning smile.</p>

<p>"Dora, my wife, you are very beautiful," said Livingstone in that deep-toned
voice, which sounded from the depths of his chest. "We have now
been married one year. You have been to me, a faithful, true and affectionate
wife. As a slight tribute of my love, let me place in your hands, this
Christmas Gift."</p>

<p>He drew from his breast, a small casket of gold richly set with jewels.
Dora received it with an exclamation of delight.</p>

<p>"A gift like this would not shame the bride of an emperor!" she murmured,
as her delicate fingers enclosed the princely gift.</p>

<p>"That casket encloses a gift, yet more precious than the jewels that glitter
on its exterior," said Livingstone as he rose from his seat. "Excuse me
one moment my love, I have some trifling orders to give to Davidson. In
an instant I will return with the key of the casket&mdash;"</p>

<p>He advanced to the door of the chamber, and passed out into the spacious
landing, at the head of the stairway. The dim beams of the stars obscured
by clouds streamed through a solitary window in the southern wall, giving
a faint light to the oaken floor and the massive walls. Closing the door of
the Oak Chamber, Livingstone stood with his back toward the window, gazing
down the dim stairway, with folded arms and compressed lips. Presently
the sound of footsteps was heard; a slight tremor ran over Livingstone's
powerful frame, and the next instant, the form of Davidson was seen through
the dusky shadows, ascending the stairway with a waiter in his hands.</p>

<p>"I will take the coffee, Davidson, while you hurry down stairs, and have my
horse brought to the hall door. Business requires my immediate return to
Philadelphia. Lose no time, my good fellow, but let it be done without an
instant's delay."</p>

<p>Taking the waiter from the astonished servant, he advanced to the window,
and laid it down gently on the oaken sill. In an instant the form of Davidson,
was lost in the shadows of the stairway, and soon the faint echo of his
footsteps sounded faintly from the hall below.</p>

<p>Livingstone stood in the faint light of the stars, gazing steadily on the
waiter, whose dark surface was relieved, by two large cups of white porcelain,
smoking with fragrant coffee.</p>

<p>For a moment the Merchant stood silent as the grave. His chest heaved,
and his lip quivered with emotion. With a low muttered groan, he drew
forth from his breast a small phial of glittering silver.</p>

<p>He raked it in the dim light, and the fingers which clasped it trembled

<!-- page 420 -->

like dry leaves in the storm. Then his blue eyes was fixed upon it with a
gaze of horrible intensity, and a single large and scalding tear, starling from
the hot eyelid, rolled slowly down his bronzed cheek.</p>

<p>"My wife!" he groaned, and still absorbed by an awful effort to control
his reeling intellect, he stood regarding that silver phial with the same wild
and intense stare.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Dora sate in the arm-chair beside the table, with the golden
casket resting lightly in her hand.</p>

<p>Her husband closed the door, and a wild expression, mingling hope and
fear, love and hate, guilt and shame, brightened and darkened over the face
of the wife.</p>

<p>Placing the casket on the table, she thrust her hands in her bosom, and
while the agitation deepened over her queenly face, she displayed two objects
in the light. One was the note, given to her by Luke Harvey the evening
before; the other was the small phial of deadly poison, which she had prepared
with such fearful secrecy and care.</p>

<p>"On one side a Coronet beckons me, on the other stands Livingstone
with love in his look and honor on his brow. Shall I choose the Coronet
then Livingstone lays a lifeless corse within this very hour! Shall I trample
the Coronet under foot, and subside from all my high dreams, into a patient
and gentle wife? <i>I</i> patient and gentle! Suppose Livingstone is dead, even
then Fitz-Cowles' plan of immediate flight is ill-judged, worse than foolish!
Livingstone once dead, I must act the disconsolate widow, walk broken
hearted at his funeral, and after a decent lapse of time, inherit the vast fortune,
left to me by my <i>affectionate</i> husband. My brain whirls, and I know
not which to choose, the phial or the letter! The one secures the eternal
secrecy of Luke; the other lays a Coronet at my feet, but the price is terrible&mdash;the
dead body of my husband! And then my oath, my oath&mdash;"</p>

<p>As the thought of that Oath, which in sight of the awful God, calling his
angels to witness, with her heart filled with pure emotions, and her hands
clasped in the hands of the only man she ever loved in solemn truth, as the
thought of that Oath flashed over her soul, Dora half started from the chair,
and uttered a low-toned shriek.</p>

<p>Livingstone's footstep broke on her ear, with a hurried movement she
buried the letter, and the phial in her bosom. Calling a calm smile to her
face, she awaited the approach of her husband.</p>

<p>"Here is the coffee, my dear," said Livingstone in a careless tone, as he
entered, and placed the waiter on the round table. "It is a long while since
I tasted coffee in this house, but I can commend old Hannah's coffee, above
all others', for its delicious flavor. Isn't it singular my dear, that so few
people in the world, know how to prepare, even tolerable coffee?"</p>

<p>Dora looked into the pale face of her husband with a glance of vacant
wonder. If there was a thing in the world that he sincerely contemned, it

<!-- page 421 -->

was a common-place remark, on any subject at all; but the pleasures of eating
and drinking, in especial. This colloquial remark on the peculiar merits
of old Hannah's coffee, might well excite the wonder of the merchant's wife.
There was a volume of awful meaning concealed under the trifling words
and careless tone of Livingstone.</p>

<p>Seating himself beside the table, the Merchant raised one of the porcelain
cups to his lips, and sipped its fragrant contents.</p>

<p>Reclining in the arm-chair, her beautiful face glowing in the mild beams
of the light, and her rounded limbs disposed in an attitude of careless languor,
Dora followed the example of her husband, and raising the other cup
to her lips, athirst from the fatigue of travel, she drank profusely of the
smoking coffee.</p>

<p>At this moment, Livingstone's blue eyes did not glare, nor shine, nor glisten;
they seemed to blaze with a glassy lustre, as deadly as light emitted
from the eye of the rattle-snake, ere it kills its victim.</p>

<p>"By-the-bye, my dear, I must mention a singular piece of news, which
overtook me on the road to Hawkewood this evening. I have spoken to you
of the noble descent of my family. I have told you that Livingstone was an
assumed name, that my grandfather left the broad lands of his barony in the
hands of distant kinsmen, when he sought the solitudes of the new world&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words of the Merchant had a strange interest for Dora. Half-starting
from the chair, she listened with flashing eyes and parted lips, to the whispered
tones of her husband.</p>

<p>"During my father's life, the last of the race of kinsmen died, leaving the
old barony without a lord. My father hastened to England, and placing his
claim to the lands and title, in the hands of able lawyers, awaited the result
with an impatience that clung to him until his dying hour. Here was the
difficulty&mdash;our Ancestor had left England, having first circulated the rumor
that he was dead, and dead without an heir. He wished to bury his name,
and the dishonor which the <i>treachery of a woman</i> had brought upon it, in
eternal oblivion. My father's lawyers found it almost impossible to prove
the identity of our ancestor, with the self-exiled Lord. That impossibility
has now been overcome. While my father's ashes rest in the family vault
of Hawkewood, side by side, with that ancestor, who exiled himself from his
native soil, I hold in my hand the pacquet which informs the Philadelphia
Merchant, that restored to the lands and title of his race he is now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," muttered Dora, as her face grew ashy pale. "Speak on, for
God's sake Livingstone. Yes&mdash;you are now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"THE LORD OF LONGFORD!" said Livingstone in a clear, deliberate tone.</p>

<p>Dora rose to her feet with a half muttered shriek.</p>

<p>"A title and in England!" she murmured, "The fulfilment of my wildest
dream! <i>Lady of Longford</i>&mdash; ha! Already I behold myself the mistress of
broad lands, already I move in the throng of a royal court, already I feel
the Coronet encircling my brow!"</p>

<!-- page 422 -->

<p>"The coronet of worms," muttered Livingstone with livid lips, as the
broken words of his wife, fell indistinctly on his ear. "Your broad lands&mdash;&mdash;a
pitiful grave, eight feet long and two feet wide!"</p>

<p>"Of course, Albert," said Dora, resuming her seat&mdash;"You will at once
proceed to England, and assume the estates and title?"</p>

<p>"Both of us will undertake a journey soon, but not to England!" muttered
Livingstone. "Would you advise me to give up my rights, the rights of an
American citizen," he continued aloud, "for the rent-roll of an English Barony,
and the empty sound of a title?"</p>

<p>"Your rights as an American citizen," sneered Dora, "Comprising among
other inestimable privileges, the right to count one, among a pitiful aristocracy,
whose high deeds are written in the ledger of a broken bank, which
chronicles the wholesale robbery of the widow and the orphan, accomplished
under the solemn sanction of the&mdash;<i>law!</i> Glorious rights indeed!"</p>

<p>"Dora shall we look at your Christmas gift?" said the Merchant with a
calm smile.</p>

<p>Dora's eye grew suddenly glassy. Was it from the overwhelming emotion
which followed Livingstone's announcement?</p>

<p>"I will move among the proudest nobles of the British Court! Rank,
title, power! The prophecy is fulfilled! The Boon is mine, without the
Crime. How my head swims&mdash;&mdash;I feel giddy&mdash;my heart&mdash;ah! I am too
much affected by this joyful intelligence."</p>

<p>As these words fell wild and trembling from her lips, while her cheek grew
crimson and ashy by turns, Livingstone sate regarding her with the same
look that glares from the eye of the tiger, ere he crushes the victim at his
feet.</p>

<p>Dora started from her seat; she pressed her hands on her forehead; the
glassy film which veiled her eyes was succeeded by a wild and flashing
lustre.</p>

<p>"Why Livingstone," she cried in a strange whisper, "The room is filled
with strangers. Ha, ha," she laughed, resuming her seat again with a look
of calm loveliness. "The suddenness, with which you imparted this unexpected
news, has given me a violent head-ache&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Down</i>," muttered Livingstone in a tone inaudible to his wife. "<i>Fiend</i>
be <i>still!</i> A little while and I am yours!" Was he speaking to the Devil
that lay couched near his heart&mdash;&mdash;the Devil of Madness?</p>

<p>"Come, Dora, look at your Christmas Present," he exclaimed in a calm
voice, as he opened the casket.</p>

<p>Dora leaned forward until her beautiful countenance well-nigh touched
the face of her husband.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha," she laughed, "Why Livingstone, what child's play is this?
You promise me jewels, and here is but a lock of hair&mdash;mine I do believe&mdash;enclosed
within this casket."</p>

<p>"Two locks of hair, my wife," spoke the deep voice of Livingstone.
"Yours and Fitz-Cowles'!"</p>

<!-- page 423 -->

<p>"Mine and Fitz-Cowles'?" echoed Dora with a look of vacant wonder.
"What mean you?"</p>

<p>Livingstone replied with a single word. Leaning forward, his blue eyes
flashing with a glance of fearful meaning, he looked like a fiend, blasting a
guilty soul with a single look.</p>

<p>"Monk-Hall!"</p>

<p>Dora looked steadily in his face, but her senses whirled in a delirium that
lasted for a single moment.</p>

<p>"Monk-Hall?" she echoed&mdash;and her face was like death&mdash;"What means
this jest?"</p>

<p>"Jest?" echoed Livingstone in a husky voice. "Vile adultress! Call
you this a jest? Two nights ago, bending over the bed, in which you and
your paramour lay, reposing in your shame, I severed these glossy locks of
hair, as witnesses of your damning guilt&mdash;"</p>

<p>Livingstone's voice was fearfully calm, as he spoke these words.</p>

<p>"Is it a jest now?" the sneer quivered on his lips, and his blue eye glared
with an expression of ferocious hatred.</p>

<p>Vain is the power of speech, to picture the horror, which convulsed the
frame of proud Dora Livingstone, as this awful discovery rushed upon her
soul, like an ante-past of hell.</p>

<p>Sinking in the chair, with her hands clasped quiveringly together, for a
moment, consciousness, reason and mind, were gone.</p>

<p>"Am I awake, am I dreaming? My brain whirls * * * all, all
discovered * * * * oh shame, eternal shame!"</p>

<p>Such were the unconcerned ravings that fell from her trembling lips.</p>

<p>"And you must die," shrieked the frenzied voice of Livingstone. "You
must die! Ere the hand of this watch tells the hour of seven, you will be a
lifeless corse!"</p>

<p>"Poisoned * * * Poisoned * * * * I see it all now!" muttered
Dora with her head resting on her shoulder, and her eyes closed in a
dreamy half consciousness, she lay, thrown helplessly in the chair.</p>

<p>"Livingstone&mdash;" she exclaimed in a low but firm voice, as slowly rising
on her feet, she looked him in the face&mdash;"Livingstone&mdash;my husband&mdash;my
friend&mdash;I am most guilty, but I can face death without a murmur!"</p>

<p>Her attitude was sublime! So weak, so trembling, so pale, and yet with
that awful stoicism on her beautiful brow!</p>

<p>It was a terrible sight for Livingstone. For a moment he trembled from
head to foot, that man of iron nerves and fearless heart. He trembled, but
it was not with one relenting throb.</p>

<p>He rushed from her side; was gone a moment; and then stood before her
once again, his tall form rising in all its majesty, while with a hand of iron
fixidity, he pointed to the object at his feet.</p>

<p>"Look!" he cried in a voice of thunder.</p>

<p>Dora bent forward, she pressed her hands to her burning forehead, and

<!-- page 424 -->

the light from the hearth, flashing over her downcast face, gave a terrible
glow to every convulsed feature. One look, and the shriek died on her lips.
At her feet, in the full light of the fire, lay the coffin, covered with black
cloth, and with a silver plate, glittering on its bosom.
One look, and she read the Name, the Day, the Death!
"Our private theatricals!" muttered Livingstone with a madman's icy
sneer. "This day, Madam, you rehearsed your own funeral! Ha, ha!
Do you remember how we rode to Hawkewood? First came your carriage,
then the hearse with the coffin of the deceased, and then the chief mourner,
ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>Dora sank in the chair. Her hands were icy cold, and her brain was a
mass of molten flame, burning through her eyeballs and her brow.</p>

<p>"It is fulfilled&mdash;&mdash;the Coronet is on my brow, yet it is a coronet of
flame! The room is filled with strangers&mdash;ah, ha! They are noble lords
and dames&mdash;&mdash;I tread the halls of a royal court! Flames? Who fired
these queenly robes&mdash;who&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh God&mdash;these hot coals upon my brain&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Did you ever see a chained tiger glutting its fierce eyes, with the agonies
of the helpless victim, whom the keeper's hand has thrust into its cage? So
Livingstone sate, with his glaring eyes, fixed upon the frenzied face of his
wife.</p>

<p>"The hand of the watch is on the hour of six; in one hour she will be a
lifeless mass, over which the worms will crawl and revel! This is my revenge!
No gushing blood, falling from a white bosom, tells the story of my
wrong and its punishment. But the soul bleeds&mdash;yes, yes&mdash;I hear its life-drops,
falling from the ghastly wound&mdash;I feast upon its quivering agonies!
The soul of my victim bleeds, ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>Pale, mute, motionless, sate fearless Dora Livingstone. Her eyes half
closed, her hands gently clasped, her bosom faintly throbbing, while her soul
became the victim of a thousand frenzies.</p>

<p>"Dora," shrieked Livingstone in the ear of the dying woman, "The hand
of death is on you, but I can save you! I have an antidote to the poison
which you sipped in your coffee&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you will give it me!" shrieked Dora, starting from her seat and
seizing him by the hand. The touch of those icy fingers thrilled him to the
heart.</p>

<p>"Give it you?" his voice sounded as though every syllable was torn from
his heart. "Three nights ago, I bent over the bed in which you lay, lapt
in the arms of shame. I listened for a word of repentance, nay, I tried to
catch but one lingering syllable of regret! Not a word, not a sound of penitence.
You had sold yourself into shame, and shame in its most polluted
shape. In that hour, woman, when my heart was breaking, when my soul
was torn from thought and reason, when all the hopes of my life were gone,
and but one awful prospect lay before me, a madman's cell, through whose

<!-- page 425 -->

barred windows I beheld the grave of a suicide, yawning for my corse, then
woman, oh then, I coined my existence into a vow! By the majesty of
God, by the doom of hell, by the awful desolation of my soul, I swore to
make you feel every throb of the agony, whose fangs quivered through my
heart!</p>

<p>"I matured my revenge in silence. I, madman that I am, through the
course of two fearful days, laid every snare to trap you into the power of
the man whom you had dishonored, dishonored! I lured you to Hawkewood,
I gave you the poison. I flung your coffin at your feet, and now,
while death darkens horribly over your soul, I dash you from me, scorn
your prayer for mercy, glory in your last agonies, and shriek in your freezing
ear, 'Dora, Dora, my love, my wife, I can save you, but I will not! I
can save you, but still you must die!'</p>

<p>"Yes," he shrieked, fixing his white lips together. "Yes! You must
die! The spirit of my race burns in my veins&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Livingstone," faltered Dora, with a look of perfect consciousness. "It
is hard to die&mdash;I am guilty but you will not, cannot kill me. Spare me
Albert, for your own sake, oh spare me!"</p>

<p>She knew that she was dying. Guilt, shame, reproach, all were forgotten;
all she craved was life! Could she have fallen dead on the floor, she would
have hailed death without a murmur. But to count each pulsation of her
freezing blood, to feel a separate agony in each throb of her bursting heart,
to meet death while her brain was reeling in a delirium, that left her still
conscious of her doom, oh merciful God, this was a hell, far beyond the rude
fancies, with which superstition goads her crouching victims.</p>

<p>"Life, life," she shrieked, "Spare me Albert&mdash;&mdash;<i>Life!</i>"</p>

<p>"Could every throb of your dying heart, take voice and form, and shriek
for pity, I tell you woman, that still my answer would be, Dora you must die!"</p>

<p>He turned away from her, as in a voice of deliberate tone, he spoke these
final words of fate.</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. With the last impulse of her failing
strength, Dora sprang forward, she flung her arms around his neck.</p>

<p>An awful convulsion distorted Livingstone's features.</p>

<p>"Oh God!" he groaned.</p>

<p>These arms&mdash;they had encircled his neck in the by-gone time of faith and
peace. That bosom, heaving against his own&mdash;so it had heaved and throbbed
in the days of his love. But that beautiful face, those eyes flashing supernatural
lustre, that long black hair showering down over the queenly form!</p>

<p>Livingstone trembled; he made an effort to unwind her arms from his
neck, but in vain! She kissed him, yes, with those ripe lips, which had called
him husband one year ago, smiling like heaven all the while, she kissed him,
and he shuddered. Her lips were like flame-coals.</p>

<p>"Life!" she whispered in husky tones, "Only <i>life!</i>"</p>

<p>Now was the awful moment. Now man of iron will, is the instant of
your fate. This moment is destiny, eternity, heaven or hell, to you!</p>

<!-- page 426 -->

<p>An expression of pity smiled from his livid face, but in an instant his
fixed determination called an awful frown to his view.</p>

<p>"Woman," he shrieked, "I have sworn it. You must die!"</p>

<p>He dashed her from him as he spoke. Her magnificent form swayed to
and fro for a moment, then with a look of terrible despair, she fell backward
over her coffin, into the arm-chair.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" she screamed, with a burst of maniac laughter. "Ha,
ha! These are brave steeds Fitz-Cowles! Away, away! With the
night we leave all danger behind. How softly the morning breaks, oh
beautiful! H-u-s-h! My mother is dying. H-u-s-h! That was her last
groan! Livingstone claims me as his bride, over the corse of my dead mother.
Heaven will bless our nuptials, yes, yes&mdash;&mdash;Ah! How cold, how
dark, how dread! We are in the death-vault now. I am not dead, yet
they bury me&mdash;oh, God, oh God! Will no one burst this coffin lid&mdash;how
it presses on my bosom, close, close, close! Oh for one gleam of God's
light again, oh for one breath of God's free air!"</p>

<p>Her dark eyes rolled in their sockets, and with her white hands she
dashed the tresses of her raven hair aside from her brow.</p>

<p>Livingstone gazed upon her, with folded arms he gazed upon the face of
his wife. Paint me, the agony of a lost soul, and I will picture for you, the
awful resolution, that distorted every feature of his face. The cold sweat
on the brow of the dying woman, was not more clammy, than the beaded
drops on the forehead of the husband.</p>

<p>"Oh, God!" Livingstone groaned, as a feeling of mercy, came stealing
over his heart. He was <i>afraid</i> that he might relent.</p>

<p>Dora rose once more upon her feet. She rose in an attitude of fearful
sublimity. Her tall form towering in all its beauty and pride, she dashed
the dark hair from her clammy brow, she raised her hand on high, with a
gesture of command. Zenobia, on her throne, with the spoils of all the nations
scattered round her feet, could never have looked, more sternly beautiful.</p>

<p>"Livingstone," she shrieked, with that upraised hand, quivering in the
air, while the cold sweat glistened in beads along her cheek and brow,
"Livingstone you <i>must</i> save me! <i>I cannot, will not die!</i>"</p>

<p>There was an awful will beaming from that woman's face. Her lips
were painfully compressed, and her dark eyes glared with a fierce light,
wild as madness and as determined as death.</p>

<p>"<i>I will not die!</i>" she shrieked, clenching her white hands in agony and
despair. Ere the words died on her lips, she fell heavily to the floor. She lay
with her head pillowed on the coffin, with her limbs flung stiffly over the
carpet, while her cheek was cold and pale as marble. Her lips they had
grown suddenly white hung gently apart, and her dark eyes, gazed steadily
on the ceiling. A glassy film was on each eye. She was dead. The
proud and peerless Dora Livingstone lay on that floor, a lifeless corse.</p>

<!-- page 427 -->

<p>"There," shrieked Livingstone, in a voice choked by despair, "There,
there&mdash;is all that was my wife!"</p>

<p>He fell on his knees beside her coffin. At this moment, a thin stream of
blood, stole from her lips, and trickled over her face and bosom, marking its
progress, with a line of ghastly red. She had died within <i>the hour;</i> her
mighty heart had burst its channels, and that blood, whose every pulsation
was a thought, now stained the whiteness of her bosom.</p>

<p>The madman knelt beside his victim. For two long days, and two weary
nights, he had anticipated the scene. With his reason, tottering all the
while, he had prepared the accumulating agonies, with which to torture her
closing hour. The journey to Hawkewood, planned with such cool deliberation,
the coffin inscribed with her name, these were alike the work of a
madman.</p>

<p>He knelt beside his victim. Was it a drop of death sweat, or a tear that
trickled down her face?</p>

<p>Not a word passed from his lips, but while his blue eyes shone, with one
fixed expression, he tore aside the robe from the breast of the corse. The
light shone on her bosom, so beautiful and yet so white and cold. And over
its alabaster skin, marring the beauty of the blue veins, trickled the thin
stream of blood, mingling with the tears that fell from the hot eyeballs of the
murderer.</p>

<p>The light from the table, and the warm glow from the hearth-side, streamed
over the muscular form of Livingstone, kneeling beside the coffin, with the
form of his dead wife resting on his arms. The contrast was full of terrible
interest. His bronzed face with the livid lips and the glaring blue eyes; her
pale countenance, with the parted lips, stained with blood, and the dark eyes,
glassy with death. The Lord of Longford with his Lady in his arms!</p>

<p>"You have won your coronet, Dora, but it is of worms! You have won
your empire, but it is a narrow grave! Here, here, lies all that was my wife!"</p>

<p>Laying her gently on the coffin, he silently arose. One look at the dead
body, and he passed from the room into the darkness of the stairway. It was
but a moment ere he stood in the large hall of the mansion, where a small
lamp, suspended from the ceiling, flung a dismal light around.</p>

<p>"Davidson," he cried in hasty and impatient tones.</p>

<p>The withered figure of the old man emerged from a side door.</p>

<p>"Your horse is saddled at the door 'Squire Livingstone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He calls me 'Squire," muttered Livingstone with a mocking smile.
" 'Squire and I am a <i>Lord!</i> Look ye Davidson, I must return to town on
business. Do not <i>disturb</i> Mrs. Livingstone before morning, she is tired, and
would have a long sleep."</p>

<p>Grasping the fur cap which he had worn to Hawkewood, from a side
table, he strode through the hall door. In a moment, the clatter of a horse's
hoofs echoed from the road leading to the mansion gate, mingled with a wild
hurrah.</p>

<!-- page 428 -->

<p>In the early dawn of the morning, a noble horse, with the saddle on his
back, covered with dust, and the bridle thrown loosely over his neck, was
seen wandering without a rider, along the public highway. It was the steed
of Livingstone.</p>

<p>For one hour the light burned merrily in the Oak Chamber, and the cheerful
glow of fire, gave warmth and comfort to the place, but the corse of the
woman and the coffin, were gone from the floor, while a plate of glittering
silver gleamed among the hearthside ashes.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br/>

<p>CHAPTER THIRD.</p>

<p class="small">HURRAH FOR THE GALLOWS!</p>

</div>

<p>"THIS is wot I calls a werry respectable family party? Here's the whole
lump of us, packed in this box of a room, together, and a jolly set we are.
Ladies and gen'l'men, I hope you'll excuse my not handin' you somefin to
drink, but you see my hands is fixed off han'some with these bracelets, and
I can't use 'em to any advantage. And so, Mister Fitz-Cowles, you wos a
forger, wos yo'&mdash;oh what a bad boy, to be a forger! sich wickedness! How
d'ye feel Peggy Grud? They <i>do</i> say you'll have to swing for murderin' that
old 'ooman. Ha, ha, hee! And Monk Luke here&mdash;&mdash;you're a nice one, I
swear! To come foolin' a wennerable old customer like me, in them rags.
Hurray for the gallows and the jail, say I! Some of us will have to swing,
and some of us will have to go to prissen&mdash;&mdash;hurray!"</p>

<p>With this cheerful sentiment on his lips, Devil-Bug glanced around his
den, while his solitary eye, twinkled with a mocking glee.</p>

<p>Lighted by the mingled beams of the lamp on the table, and the cheerful
coal fire burning in the grate, the Doorkeeper's den, was tenanted by some
five or six individuals, whose dress and appearance was in strong contrast.</p>

<p>Silent and alone on one side of the fire-place, was Fitz-Cowles, his face
pressed against the manacles which imprisoned his wrists, while his feet
rested on the rounds of the chair, and his knees touched his forehead. A
more perfect picture of shame, mortification and hopelessness, cannot be
imagined.</p>

<p>Forming a group on the opposite side of the fire, were the respectable worthies,
Mother Nancy, Peggy Grud, and Devil-Bug. The old hag of the
mansion, sate with her pinioned arms crossed over her breast, while the light
shone over her withered face, every sharp feature, compressed in an expression
of overwhelming spite. Peggy Grud sate swaying her body to and fro,
and wringing her hands, while her Egyptian mummy face, was impressed
with an expression of lugubrious solemnity. The distorted face of Devil-Bug,
with the matted hair falling thick and tangled over the protuberant

<!-- page 429 -->

brow, stood out boldly in the light, while his solitary eye glared, and his
wide lips quivered with a mocking sneer.</p>

<p>At the head of the table smoking a huge German pipe, sate our friend Major
Rappahannock Mulhill, his red round face beaming with an agreeable smile,
as with his half closed eyes he gazed around the place. Luke Harvey in the
rags of Brick-Top, sat by his shoulder, his long dark hair falling in lank
masses, aside from his marked and expressive countenance.</p>

<p>"You can't convict me of nothin' you can't, you can't, you <i>can't!</i>" And
Mother Nancy's grey eyes rolled to and fro, like the eyes of an enraged
parrot. "I'm a respectable widder, as keeps a respectable house, an' I defies
you. There now!"</p>

<p>"Werry good," murmured Mulhill, taking the pipe from his mouth.
"Wot's yer idea-r o' things, Peggy dear?"</p>

<p>"Och, whilaloo!" moaned that respectable lady. "To think on a civil
woman an' a dacent, bein' tuk up for the murder on her missus! Och&mdash;och!
Will nobody take a pistil and <i>shot</i> me dead, and bury me out o' sight?"</p>

<p>"Wot's yer idea-r Fitz-Cowles? Didn't I do you <i>ree</i>ther brown?"</p>

<p>Fitz-Cowles did not raise his head from between his manacled hands, but
a deep curse, mingled with a groan, burst from his compressed lips.</p>

<p>"Wot's the use o' growlin', " shouted Devil-Bug with a grin. "Some of us
will go to prissen, and some of us 'ill be hung! Hurray! It's only a kick
and a jerk, and won's as dead as a herrin'! I've hung a man in my time,
I have that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"S'pose you give us a leetle sarmin on that pint," calmly remarked Easy
Larkspur, or Major Mulhill, as the reader likes. "We're all a-waitin' for
Alderman Tallow-docket, who's to bind yo' over, and send yo' to prissin.
Peggy Grud was brought out for final examination; and as I thought the
Alderman 'ud like to make one job of it, I left her in this den, while I made
a rush on the fellers down in the cellar. S'pose they're all quiet enough in
charge o' th' police? Fire away <i>Brother</i> Devil-Bug. Give us your experience
on hangin'!"</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">THE HANGMAN'S GLEE.</p>

</div>

<p>"HURRAY for hangin' say I! It's only a kick an' a jerk, and a feller
goes like a shot, right slap into kingdom come. It does won's heart good to
look upon them two pieces o' timber, with a beam fixed cross-wise, and a
rope danglin' down&mdash;hurray for hangin'!</p>

<p>"It war'n't more nor five years since, that I hung a man. Talk o' hangin'
a dog or a cat, wot is it to hangin' a man? When I was quite a little
shaver I used to hang a puppy or a pussy-cat, and I used to think it quite
refreshin'. But hangin' a man? Ho-hoo! That's the ticket!</p>

<p>"It was a fine June morning, and I walks along one o' them dark entries
in the Eastern Pennytensherry, and I walks into a cell. It was purty

<!-- page 430 -->

dark I tell you. A bit of light came through the narrer winder, an' in one
corner o' the cell I sees a young man, with a white face, and curly dark
hair. He was settin' in a corner, with his knees drawed up to his chin.</p>

<p>" 'Get up' ses I, 'get up young man. There's business for you.' He
raises his head, an' he gives a kind o' start. You see I'm not werry han'some,
at any time, but just then, I looked pertiklerly dev'lish. The Marshal
had giv' me a yard or two ov black crape, and I'd put it round my face,
with a hole cut, for my eye, to look thro' and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'Come my feller,' ses I, 'There's business for you.'</p>

<p>" 'I didn't murder the Capt'n,' ses he. 'Before God, if it was my last
word I didn't&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Yo' see he'd been condemned for murderin' the Capt'in of a wessel at sea,
an' there wos considerable doubt about it, but as he was a poor devil, and
a stranger, the Judge and the jury, thought the best thing they could do for
him wos to hang him, for <i>fear you</i> know he mightn't be able to get work
the next winter.</p>

<p>" 'Come my chap,' ses I, a-bindin' his hands. 'I'm an ugly devil, but
you needn't be frightened, for I'm sent here by the LAW,' pronouncin' the
word big you know? 'THE LAW, wot takes care ov everybody and can't
never be bribed. Come feller.'</p>

<p>"I bound his hands, and led him from the cell. The poor fool was mutterin'
nonsense about his mother and sister all the while. In a minnit we
stood under the archway o' the prissin gate. It wos werry cold and damp.
A kind of chill, went thro' me when I looked at the pitiful face of the boy, for
he wasn't more nor ninenteen, but that was only the cold you know? It
only tuk a minnit to rig him out in a white roundabout, and then I led him
out of the prissin gate.</p>

<p>"Hurray, wot a sight! Soldiers in gay coats and spangles, all standin'
around a cart, with a pine box, an' a parson in it!</p>

<p>" 'Wot's that?' says Charley&mdash;for that wos his name&mdash;'Wot's that?'</p>

<p>" 'Oh,' ses I, 'that's the blue sky, and yander's Bush Hill, an' yander's
Fairmount Water Works, and them things wot yo' hear singin' is
birds and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>" 'But that thing in the cart,' ses he.</p>

<p>" 'That's a black bird, or rather a crow come to pray over yer dead body,
boy. It's a parson, Charley. For you're to be <i>hung</i>, to-day hung, <i>hung</i>,
d'ye hear, and these soldiers and the parson and me, is to be chief mourners
at yer funeral.'</p>

<p>"I never saw sich a feller in my life! His lip was like iron, and his dark
eye, firm as rivet.</p>

<p>" 'But that,' ses he, pintin' to th' cart, 'That box&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'That's yer coffin,' ses I, helpin' him into the cart, 'Sit down an' take
a cheer.' He sit down on the coffin, mutterin' about his mother and sisters
in some far away land, an' I seized the reins and giv' the horse a lick, and

<!-- page 431 -->

the soldiers began to march, and the wheels o' th' cart to rumble, and the parson
to look solemn&mdash;hurray!</p>

<p>"Trum-te-trum-te-tum-tum, went the drums a-beatin' the dead march,
rattle, rattle, went the wheels of the cart, and away we goes, down Schuylkill
Sixth Street, toward Bush Hill.</p>

<p>"Charley the poor devil, wot was a-goin' to be hung, set on th' cart a-groanin'.
'My mother, my mother!' he cries, 'and my sister Annie&mdash;oh
God! Oh God!'</p>

<p>" 'Don't swear,' ses the parson, 'My werry dear young friend, don't you
know it's wrong to swear, and them wot does it, 'ill be burnt in th' burnin'
lake&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'Parson,' ses I, turning suddenly round, 'What 'ill you have for dinner
to-day?'</p>

<p>" 'Roast lamb with mint sauce,' ses he, and then he blushed, for I'd took
him all aback. I know'd he was thinkin' on his dinner all the while,
and I thought I'd expose the old genelman.</p>

<p>" 'Hurray,' ses I, as the cart reached the top of a little hill in the middle
of the dusty street. 'Hurray,' ses I, 'look yander my boy!'</p>

<p>"Charley looks up, and gives a groan. What d'ye think he saw? A
great big, black, mass of people, reaching over Bush Hill, fur as the eye
could see, with a gibbet rising in the middle of the crowd. The hot sun,
was shinin' down upon us, and the drums went trum-te-trum, and the cart
wheels went rumble rumble, and on we went, the poor devil that wos to be
hung, the Parson that wos to pray over him, and <i>me</i> that wos to hang him!</p>

<p>"The mob seed us, and like a shot they rushed toward the cart. 'There
he is,' ses a woman with a baby in her arms; 'Where, where!' roars a
man who come sixty miles a-foot to see him hung, 'By G&mdash;d he'll die
game,' screams a gambler with a sweat cloth in one hand and a table in
the t'other.</p>

<p>"You never see'd sich a mob in all your life. All over Bush Hill, from
the old Hospital, where the people used to die of yaller fever, away towards
Fairmount, that crowd was scattered, hooting, yelling, swearing and screaming
like devils, as they see'd the cart and the soldiers, movin' toward the
gibbet.</p>

<p>" 'Keep up your spirits Charley,' ses I, 'The Law&mdash;' pronouncin' it
big&mdash;'The LAW is a merciful old codger, is the law! There's a strong
rope for you yonder, and a good stout piece o' timber&mdash;'</p>

<p>"As I said this, whether it was from the heat or the dust, or whether the
poor crittur was ashamed to be seen in sich work, I never could 'xactly tell,
but the horse fell down like <i>that</i>, and lay in the middle o' th' road, dead as
a stone.</p>

<p>"The mob giv' a yell! I puts the coffin on my shoulder, and hooks
Charlie's arm in mine, and beckons to the Parson, and the Captain giv's the
word to the soldiers, and away we tramps toward the gallows.</p>

<!-- page 432 -->

<p>" 'The Lord is merciful,' whispered the Parson. 'His word is peace
and good will to men&mdash;'</p>

<p>" 'Then why do they hang me?' cries Charley, as he went boldly for'ard,
'Oh my God&mdash;my mother, and my sister!' and then the feller begins to
moan, and talk of his mammy and his sister sittin' at the cottage door in
England, expectin' their Charley to come back and, 'Here,' ses he,
'Here am I goin' to be hung like a dog, like a dog,' yes ses he repeatin'
it, '<i>Like a dog!</i>'</p>

<p>"As he sed this, a white pigeon fluttered over his head. The boy looks

up, and a tear stands in his eye.</p>

<p>" 'Look here my chap,' ses he to me, as I went trampin' on with the
coffin on my shoulder, 'Jist sich a pigeon as that, white as snow, I gave
to Annie afore I left home&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Would you believe it? The words wasn't out o' his lips when the pigeon
fell dead at his feet, in the hot dust of the road.</p>

<p>"The mob yelled agin! What they yelled about, I never could tell, but
there's somethin so jolly in seein' a live man, walking to a gallows, that I
couldn't help joinin' in with 'em; 'Hurray,' ses I, 'Hurray for the gibbet!
The good old gallows law forever an' Amen!'</p>

<p>"Charley didn't say a word arter that, but went up the gallows' steps
without so much as a start. Wasn't it a grand sight for us fellers on the
platform? There was the Marshall, a fine fat faced feller; there was the
Parson, in his white cravat and black clothes, there was I, Devil-Bug, the
Hangman, with the crape over my face, and there was the poor devil, as
wos to be hung, standin' in the midst of us all, dressed in a white roundabout,
with a face like a cloth, and curly hair, dark as jet.</p>

<p>" 'Hurray,' ses I, 'wot a sight! Keep up yer spirits Charley. Jist look at
the people, come to see yo' hung! Look at the Soldiers with their feathers
and bagnets, jist look at the women, with babies in their arms, look at the
gamblers, playin' thimble rig, look at the rum, my boy, in the tents yonder,
and then, hurray! Look at the folks scattered all over Bush Hill, on
the house tops away off yonder, and far down the streets! Hurray, my
boy, there's a big crowd come to see you die, and so wot's the use o' grumblin'
about yer mother and sister, and a cussed white pigeon?'</p>

<p>"The mob giv' a howl! It was near twelve o'clock, and they wanted
their show.</p>

<p>" 'It wants ten minnits o' th' time,' ses the Marshall, an' the Parson,
comes up to Charley, and taps him on the shoulder, and ses he, 'Look up,
my friend. God is merciful. Let us pray!'</p>

<p>And then we all kneeled down, and the Parson made a short prayer
about the Mercy o' God and the widders and orphans, and them deluded
devils as hadn't sich a good Gospel an' sich a stout Gallows. While he
was prayin' I saw two gentlemen, with knowin' faces, slyly creepin' up the
ladder, and lookin' over the edge o' th' platform. I know'd 'em well. I'd

<!-- page 433 -->

stole dead bodies for 'em a hundred times. They were doctors, a-waitin'
for the dead body o' Charley the English boy.</p>

<p>The Parson cuts his prayer off short, and we all gits on our feet ag'in.</p>

<p>" 'Come Charley,' ses I, 'don't be frightened,' an' I fixes the knot behind his
ear. A delicate knot, it was! You know it was tied right behind the ear,
so that his fall, would break his neck, like <i>that!</i> Then I felt his smooth
neck, and ses I, 'it 'ill soon be over Charley, and you won't think anything
more of yer mother, or yer sister, or that cussed white pigeon.'</p>

<p>" 'Feller,' ses he, 'yer honest. Here's all I have to giv' yo'. Keep it
for my sake.'</p>

<p>"An' he giv' me the striped handkercher from his neck. It was purty
hot, I tell yo', but a shiver ran over me, when he did this.</p>

<p>" 'Time's up,' ses the Marshall. The mob giv' a yell. The doctors
watin' for the body, comes up a step higher on the ladder, and the Parson,
smacked his lips, as tho' he felt uncommon hungry.</p>

<p>" 'A glass o' water,' ses Charley, in a faint way, but still as firm as a
rock. A boy with blue eyes an' yaller hair, was hoisted on a man's shoulders,
from among the mob, till he was even with the platform.</p>

<p>" 'God bless yo' my boy,' ses Charley, 'An' may yo' never have a
mother an' a sister, a-sittin' at the cottage door, a-waitin' fur yo' to come
home, when yer a-hangin' in some far off land, hangin' like a dog!'</p>

<p>"He takes the glass o' water; he looks at it for a minnit; and then at the
sky, and the sun, and the great big crowd, and the roofs of the houses filled
with people. I'll never forgit that look! His eyes looked as if they was
set afire, and his lower lip, worked like a bit o' twisted rope.</p>

<p>" 'I am innocent,' ses he, and then, cool as you please, he pours the tumbler
o' water, right down on the platform floor.</p>

<p>" 'That water will dry up, but my blood, will never dry up, from your
soil, while yonder sun shines!'</p>

<p>" 'Time's up,' ses the Marshall. I stuck the white cap on his forehead.
I draw'd it over his eyes! Hurray! What a look he giv' as the cap, came
down over his forehead. He stood in the centre o' th' platform, with the cap
over his eyes an' the rope around his neck. The mob held their breath.
In that big crowd, you couldn't hear the sound of a human voice.</p>

<p>"With one kick o' my foot, I pushed away the trap. For a minnit the
sun seemed dark, and the next minnit&mdash;ho, hoo! There quiverin' strugglin',
twistin', was the body of a man, plungin' at the end of a rope, with
his tongue&mdash;black as a hat&mdash;stickin' out from under the edge o' th' white
cap&mdash;&mdash;hurray!</p>

<p>"There was a noise like water pourin' from a jug turned up-side down,
there was a plunge and a jerk and then the body o' the poor devil quivered
like a leaf. The mob gave one yell, which sounded as tho' Fairmount Dam
had broke loose, with a devil shoutin' from every wave! You could see

<!-- page 434 -->

quiverin' run over the body of the boy, from head to foot. Maybe he heered
that yell, maybe he see'd strange sights in t'other world! Who knows?</p>

<p>"For thirty minutes we kept him hanging, for thirty minutes the mob yelled
and cursed and swore and hurrahed!</p>

<p>"But when I cut the dead body down&mdash;that was the time for fun! To see
the Doctors huddle the carcase into the pine coffin, to see the Parson hurry
one way, the Marshall another, to see the soldiers march off, with old Devil-Bug
in their midst, guardin' him from danger!</p>

<p>"Ho-hoo! This individ<i>oo</i>al felt like a king, about that time!</p>

<p>"And then to look back and see the mob tearing the gibbet to pieces, and
bearin' splinters away in their fingers, that they might take 'em home to
their families, and brag of seein' a man hung! Ho-hoo!</p>

<p>"That night I see'd the poor devil's dead body cut and slashed on a dissectin'
table, with old doctors prowlin' about like wolves, with bits o' flesh
between their fingers!</p>

<p>"One of 'em scraped his skull, and cleaned it like a bowl, an' put it in a
case, with a label, '<i>This is the skull of Charles &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; the Pirate.</i>'</p>

<p>"Hurray for the gallows, say I! It's only a kick an' a jerk, and a feller
goes straight to kingdom come!</p>

<p>*"The good old gallows law, forever, and ever, A-men!"</p>

<p class="small">[*The main incidents of this episode are strictly true. The Hangman, of course, is alone,
responsible for the language and opinions of the story.]</p>

<p>"That's wot I calls a werry good story!" And Major Mulhill emitted a
succession of smoke rings from his mouth. "Bray-vo! An' allow me to
tell you Mister Devil-Bug that you'll have a pleasant opportunity o' puttin' it
into practice yerself! Jist look at the crittur with his one eye, and his bushy
head&mdash;wot a parfect fiend!"</p>

<p>Fitz-Cowles half-raised his head from his manacled hands. "Come here
Mulhill," he said in a husky whisper. "I've something to say to you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Easy Larkspur strode toward the fire-place, and in a moment, seated by
the side of Fitz-Cowles, he was listening to the earnest whispers of the Forger.</p>

<p>"Would you like to know anything o' that g-a-l?" said Devil-Bug, approaching
the side of Luke Harvey.</p>

<p>"The girl&mdash;Mabel&mdash;" cried Luke, raising his head from his hands.
"Where is she?"</p>

<p>"That's the quest'in!" coolly responded Devil-Bug. "I s'pose you know
she's the darter o' Livingstone? Them papers wot you read to me in this
room, settled that matter. And that hell-cat Bess, told you all about it&mdash;hey?"</p>

<p>"Where is this girl?" asked Luke with a manner of evident interest.</p>

<p>"Ho-hoo! s'pose I'm goin' to tell you with these ornaments on my hands?
Vonders how <i>that</i> 'ud vork? Strike off these irons, gin' me an hour's liberty,
and I'll lead you to the place where you kin fight for the g-a-l&mdash;&mdash;yes
<i>fight</i> for her!"</p>

<!-- page 435 -->

<p>Luke's face was agitated by a strange and deep emotion, that flashed from
his eye, and quivered in his nostrils.</p>

<p>"This way Larkspur," he cried, beckoning to that worthy, and leading
the way from the den into the dark hall of the mansion. By the dim light
which came from the roof, far above, the forms of some thirty men, manacled
and pinioned, might be discovered, thrown along the floor in various
attitudes, while the sound of shouts mingled with laughter, came from the
regions of the cellar.</p>

<p>"Them is our wictims," muttered Larkspur, as they stood in the gloom
of the hall. "Them shouts is from my beaks! They're makin' reether
free with the likker I tell you!"</p>

<p>"I wish to speak with you on a matter of deep interest," said Luke.
"This Devil-Bug here, has in his keeping, a secret of the utmost importance
to myself and Livingstone. That secret, we can only obtain by his liberation
for the space of an hour&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wot!" interrupted Larkspur with an indignant start. "Would yo' have
a special Deppitty o' the Honorable Ma'or, let a prisoner slip? Have you
been indulgin' in ardent sperrits or green peas, young man?"</p>

<p>"Wonders how <i>that</i> 'ill vork&mdash;ho, ho, hoo?" shouted a well-known voice
from the Doorkeeper's den.</p>

<p>Luke pushed open the door, and beheld Devil-Bug standing in the middle
of the room, brandishing his freed arms over his head, while he danced round
the hand-cuffs laying on the floor.</p>

<p>"Where's Fitz-Cowles, you devil?" shrieked Luke.</p>

<p>"Escaped! We found this feller's key on the floor&mdash;ho, ho, hoo! He
unlocked my hand-cuffs, and I unlocked his'n. Look at the front door&mdash;ho,
hoo! Wonders how <i>that</i> 'ill vork!"</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n&mdash;n!" shrieked Luke, rushing through the front door. "This
villain shall not escape me thus!"</p>

<p>"I'm ruined, tee-totally smashed!" whined Larkspur, while his fat face
assumed an expression of the most painful grief. "Oh, my grasshus, if I
only had a small family of a wife and fifteen children, to excite the symp<i>er</i>thies
of the public, for an unfort'nate poleese Deppitty!"</p>

<p>Tearing his hair, in unfeigned anguish, he rushed through the front door,
leaving Devil-Bug standing in the centre of the den, while Mother Nancy and
Peggy Grud sate against the wall, yelling and swinging their bodies backwards
and forwards to the same lively tune.</p>

<p>"Now g-a-l, to drag you from the Wizard's den!" shrieked Devil-Bug,
tramping through the front door. "First I must get Luke, and then, ho,
hoo! She'll roll in Livingstone's wealth&mdash;<i>That</i> 'ill work just right!"</p>

<p>"See'd yo' iver the likes o' this?" whined Peggy Grud. "Them to git
off, and not cut us loose! Whilaloo&mdash;ochone!"</p>

<p>"Young 'ooman, vy should I leave my rispectable dwellin'?" asked
Mother Nancy with spiteful severity. "Here I've lived, and here I'll stick

<!-- page 436 -->

till I die&mdash;He, he, he-e! Didn't I see the note which Fitz-Cowles giv' to
Larkspur? He, he, h-e-e! It was a thousan' dollars I'll be bound!"</p>

<p>As she spoke, the room was filled by the band of police officers, who had
been hurried from their revel down stairs, by the sounds of uproar, in the
Doorkeeper's Den.</p>

<p>CHAPTER FOURTH.</p>

<p class="small">THE CHAPEL OF JESUS.</p>

</div>

<p>THE Oak Chamber of Hawkewood yet once again!</p>

<p>The lights on the round table are burning fast toward their sockets, and
the remains of the blazing wood fire, smoulder away the ashes of the hearth.
The gold watch on the table, tells the hour of eleven. All is silent through
the chamber, and through the mansion, silent and sad as the tomb.</p>

<p>Who gazing around this chamber, as it is now revealed, in glimmering
light, might guess the nature of the awful tragedy enacted within its walls,
since yon watch, marked the hour of six? The Chamber is the same, as
when Livingstone and his wife first stepped over its threshold. The heavy
curtains of the bed still droop from the canopy down to the floor, in thick
and purple folds; the hangings of the windows toward the east, turned partly
aside, still disclose the massive oaken frames; the light still shines on the
faded colors of the old-fashioned carpet, and the dusky carvings of the
wainscot, still receive its genial glow. The round table is still there, and
on either side, are the Gothic arm-chairs, placed in the same position, as
they stood, five hours ago. The coffin and the corse is gone, but amid the
grey hickory ashes, glitters a bright object, like a piece of burnished silver.</p>

<p>All was deadly still, through the mansion, when the sound of a footstep
was heard from the main stairway; it grew near and nearer, until it echoed
without the chamber door. There was silence again, for a moment, and
then the door flew open, and a wild haggard figure advanced toward
the light.</p>

<p>It was Algernon Fitz-Cowles! His black hair streaming back from his
uncovered brow, his dress torn and soiled with dust, his bronzed face
covered with thick perspiration, while his dark eyes, rolled to and fro, with
the glare of a bloodhound at bay, he advanced toward the light, and flung
a glittering bowie-knife on the table.</p>

<p>"If they want to trap the bloodhound, they must fight for it!" he muttered
in tones hoarse with rage. "Ha! On the Gulf of Mexico, in the
streets of New Orleans, in the dens of Charleston, in the rookeries of Mobile,

<!-- page 437 -->

there have been men who dared my hate, and <i>died!</i> Yes, like dogs,
with <i>that</i> knife in their hearts! And shall I be trapped by a paltry counter-hopper,
a peddler of tapes and thimbles? The <i>Son</i> of old &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; is not
to be scared by such mean dogs!</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! That was a gallant ride! Dim was faithful to me, by * * *!
The river passed, two blood horses waited for me in the woods beyond
Camden. 'Now hey, for Hawkewood&mdash;hurray!' says I, feeling the old
blood of the Gulf, in my veins, once again. Not a hundred yards over
the sandy road before my pursuers were at my heels! Mounted on good
horses too, but&mdash;hurrah!</p>

<p>"Over hill and thro' hollow, over brook and crag, with their hootings
giving fresh speed to my noble horses, on, on, like a devil I flew! One by
one my pursuers drop; one by one their horses fall! Hurrah! By a lucky
chance, I find the way to Hawkewood; my horses are at the door, and now
for Burlington! Dora promised to meet me at the door. Curse the thing,
why was she not there?</p>

<p>"Lucky for me again&mdash;the hall door was wide open&mdash;I mount the stairs
and here I am! Yes, yes, <i>they</i> must fight for it! Now for the search for
Dora&mdash;ha! Livingstone's watch? She must be in the house; perchance
in this very chamber."</p>

<p>He advanced to the bedside; a gust of cold wind pouring through the open
door tossed the curls of his hair, and extinguished the lights on the table.</p>

<p>"Curse the thing!" muttered Fitz-Cowles. "The devil was in that wind!
How thick these curtains are!" he exclaimed tossing the dark purple
folds aside.</p>

<p>"Ha! A woman's form&mdash;By Heaven it is Dora!"</p>

<p>All was dark within the bed, but a faint gleam from the fireside, revealed
the form of a queenly woman, half-concealed by the folds of the coverlid.</p>

<p>"Dora&mdash;Dora," softly murmured Fitz-Cowles, bending over the bed.
"Ha! She is asleep. Her face is concealed by those dark curls&mdash;let me
sweep them gently aside. Dora&mdash;awake&mdash;it is the hour of our flight&mdash;awake!"</p>

<p>Not a sound, not a murmur. He reached forth his hand, and dashing
the coverlid aside, took her white hand within his own. As he did this, the
withdrawn curtain, swung slowly over him, and gathered him within its folds.</p>

<p>"Great God! Her hand is cold as ice!" he muttered as he stood in the
same darkness that enveloped the bed. "Dora, awake! Pshaw! How
sound the woman sleeps? Know you not 'tis the hour of our flight&mdash;rise,
Dora, and let us away!"</p>

<p>Sweeping the coverlid yet farther aside, he placed his hand upon her bosom,
it was bare and cold as marble. Fitz-Cowles could feel the clammy
sweat starting from his brow, while a horrible suspicion rushed like a thunder-bolt
upon his brain.</p>

<!-- page 438 -->

<p>With one grasp he tore the curtains from the bed; he started back a step,
and a warm gleam from the fireside lit up the scene.</p>

<p>The form of Dora Livingstone, cold and white as snow, with every vestige
of apparel, stript from its outlines of loveliness, lay before him. The
dark hair fell around the pale face, and the glassy eyes were upturned,
with a freezing stare.</p>

<p>"Ha-h!" screamed Fitz-Cowles, with an unearthly shriek. "The woman
is dead, <i>dead!</i>"</p>

<p>A sudden glow from the fireside, flashed over the livid face of Fitz-Cowles,
and over the form of the dead woman. For a moment those round arms,
that bosom of swelling loveliness, that face of thought linked with beauty,
and that form of peerless outlines, rich waving and voluptuous, looked like
life, and then all was death again.</p>

<p>Fitz-Cowles stood stricken dumb with unutterable horror. Even in his
base heart, there lurked a feeling like love, for the woman who lay before him.</p>

<p>"The woman is dead," he muttered, and looked up vacantly. He started
back with a yell. There, there, before him, from the darkness on the opposite
side of the bed, like the vision of some fiend whom his words had
raised from hell, there gleamed two eyes, flashing with unutterable lustre,
and there, the livid outlines of a bronzed face, stood out boldly in the fireside
light.</p>

<p>"I am lost!" was the exclamation of the cowering wretch, and ere the
words died on his lips, the tall form of Livingstone was at his side.</p>

<p>"Wretch!" he shrieked, with his wide chest heaving, and his muscular
arms, flung madly on high&mdash;"Wretch! Behold your work&mdash;this ruin of
loveliness and innocence!"</p>

<p>He pointed at the dead body, and then with a howl, like a tiger on the
spring, he rushed upon his victim.</p>

<p>"You must die," he shrieked, "By the God above us, you must die!"</p>

<p>"Stand back," faltered Fitz-Cowles, retreating towards the fire-place.
"Do not lay your hands on me. I am armed, I am&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words died on his lips! Livingstone's writhing fingers were round
his throat, Livingstone's iron arm encircled his trembling frame. He raised
him in the air, high over his head, with all the force of his muscular arms,
gathered in the effort, he swung the craven aloft, and for a single moment,
held him quivering there! His dark eye glaring on the hot coals, and his
bronzed face one terrible frown, he dashed the forger to the floor, not with
the iron strength of his arms expended in the blow, but with a contemptuous
movement, as though he but crushed the reptile that bit his heel.</p>

<p>"Go!" he shouted, in a voice of thunder. "Go! Miscreant and swindler!
You are too mean a thing for my vengeance!"</p>

<p>"But not for mine!" shouted a calm and determined voice, striding forward
in the light. "Villain you are my&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The bold words faltered on Luke Harvey's lips.</p>

<!-- page 439 -->

<p>"Dora!" he shrieked, gazing on the dead body, as the light from the
fire flashed over its pale outlines. There was a universe of horror, love
and revenge, mingled in the emphasis with which he uttered that single
word&mdash;"Dora!"</p>

<p>"Come," he fiercely shouted, turning to Fitz-Cowles, who leaned
against the mantel. "This man has been wronged, this woman murdered,
through your crimes! I am the Avenger of the Wrong and the Murder!
Come! Here are two pistols&mdash;take your choice. One of us must die!"</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, hoo! Wot a pictur'! A dead 'oman, and a crazy husband,
an' my friends Monk Fitz-Cowles an' Monk Luke! Things doesn't seem
to work right!"</p>

<p>His upraised hand, holding a light above his head, Devil-Bug stood in the
doorway, every feature of his face distorted by a sneering grimace, and his
solitary eye, full of malignant fire.</p>

<p>"Come!" shouted Luke, motioning Fitz-Cowles toward the door.</p>

<p>"I will fight you!" muttered Fitz-Cowles with a look of fiendish hate.
"Aye, if it is over a table, with but an arm's length between us!"</p>

<p>Devil-Bug led the way toward the landing; Fitz-Cowles followed; Luke
alone remained on the threshold. He cast one last look into the chamber.</p>

<p>"Luke, Luke," shouted a well-known voice, "One year ago, she crossed
my threshold a fair young bride&mdash;and now&mdash;oh God!"</p>

<p>Luke beheld the form of Livingstone kneeling beside the dead body of
his wife.</p>

<p>"Come!" he shouted, leading the way down the stairway. It required
but a few moments, for the three to traverse the entire length of the corridor,
on the second floor, which extended through half the length of the mansion,
toward the south. Devil-Bug led the way, holding the light overhead, and
at his back, in grim silence followed Luke and Fitz-Cowles.</p>

<p>They passed the doors of many rooms, but did not pause, until the corridor
was terminated by a wide oaken door, that occupied its entire width.</p>

<p>"Here is the scene of my Sacrifice!" said Luke, pushing open the door
with his foot. "Little did I ever think, when I used to roam these halls,
many a day gone by, that the Chapel of Hawkewood would ever be polluted
by the blood of a coward and a forger."</p>

<p>"<i>Coward</i> in your teeth!" shouted Fitz-Cowles, hoarse with rage. "You
shall pay for this insolence with your blood!"</p>

<p>"Devil-Bug," said Luke, with a calmness of voice, that was evidently
assumed. "Watch without this door. Watch I say, until this <i>affair</i> is
finished. When one of us, appears at this door, with the dead body of the
other in his arms, let that man pass! But until one is dead, let neither of
us, pass from this door. Bury the dead man in the vaults of Hawkewood,
and keep the secret of his death. You are a desperate man, Devil-Bug,
and I can trust you, with this matter. You swear to do, as I command?"</p>

<p>"I do!" answered Devil-Bug, with a hideous grin. "Hurray with the fun!"</p>

<p>Taking the light from Devil-Bug, Luke led the way into the Chapel of

<!-- page 440 -->

Hawkewood, followed by Fitz Cowles. The door closed behind them, as
they entered the place, whose walls, would witness a scene of bloodshed
and death.</p>

<p>It was a long and narrow room, with an oaken floor, and an arching
ceiling. Not a solitary window, gave light to the place, and the only entrance,
was the door through which they had passed, which opened into the
centre of the room. The southern end of the room, was concealed by a
large picture, which reached from wall to wall, and from the ceiling to the
floor. In front of this picture arose a piece of carved statuary, painted to
represent the hues of life and agony. And some few paces, in front, of the
image, was a small square table, covered with a mouldering white cloth.
On the picture was delineated the Virgin Mary and her holy child; the statue,
was an image of the expiring Redeemer, stretched on the cross, in all
the agonies of superhuman suffering, yet with a godlike triumph breaking
over his brow. The table, covered with white cloth, was the Altar of
God, on which the vessels of the holy sacrament had lain, in many a solemn
hour, while the tears of remorse and anguish sprinkled the oaken floor.</p>

<p>And those hard planks, around the altar, in more places than one, were
worn into deep hollows. Here had Lord Walter Longford, the first proprietor
of Hawkewood, knelt during the still watches of night, groaning in
agony as he thought of the dishonor of his house.</p>

<p>"We will fight over this altar," said Luke, as he moved the table,
nearer the centre of the room. "It is but just that wrongs, such as I
have to avenge, should be avenged over the altar of God, in sight of his
cross!"</p>

<p>The light was on the altar, and Luke stood with his back to the cross,
his tall form, towering in all its height, as with the pistol in his hand, he
gazed fiercely in the face of Fitz-Cowles.</p>

<p>"<i>Monk</i> Luke," sneered the Forger, taking his place on the opposite side,
"You deserve your title! But enough of this trifling; I am waiting to
chastise your impertinence. What shall be our signal?"</p>

<p>Luke silently took a letter from his pocket, and tore a narrow slip of
paper from the outside. Then creasing this piece of paper, with his finger,
he poured some few grains of powder into the hollow thus made, from
a flask which he drew from his coat pocket. He rolled the paper in
his hand, until it enveloped the powder, and advancing to the altar, wound
it around the wick of the candle, between the flame, and the hollow which
it had burned in the wax.</p>

<p>"When the candle burns down to that paper, and fires the powder, then
let each man take care of his life!"</p>

<p>"Agreed," muttered Fitz-Cowles, examining the percussion cap of his
pistol. "When the paper and the powder blazes, then by * * * I'll fire!"</p>

<p>For a single moment the antagonists, contemplated each other. There
were but five paces between them. Fitz-Cowles was lividly pale, but a
gleam of ferocity stamped his craven face, while from every line of Luke's

<!-- page 441 -->

countenance, from his compressed lip, and clear dark eye, there spoke the
same holy resolution. He stood there, in that Chapel, as the Avenger of
Wrong and Murder!</p>

<p>Lower and lower burned the candle, until the flame, touched the paper
which enveloped the powder. A start quivered through Fitz-Cowles' frame,
but Luke's firm fingers clenched his pistol with an iron grasp.</p>

<p>"In a moment, I may be in&mdash;hell!" muttered Fitz-Cowles.</p>

<p>"Think of the dead body of your victim, think of Dora!" shrieked Luke,
and the powder blazed up around the candle-wick.</p>

<p>There was a report; two pistols mingled their sounds together, and white
columns of smoke, rolled upward to the ceiling. When that smoke cleared
away, each antagonist, beheld his foe, standing unharmed, unhurt, on the
opposite side of the altar. Luke's ball had grazed Fitz-Cowles shoulder,
and sunk in the wall behind; the shot of the forger, had whistled by Harvey's
right temple, and splintered the face of the Image at his back.</p>

<p>"Wonders how <i>that</i> 'ill work!" roared a hoarse voice, without the door.</p>

<p>"Now fool and coward! You have spent your shot!" muttered Fitz-Cowles,
drawing a bowie knife from his bosom, and rushing toward the
altar. "You have defied a man, who never yet failed, with this good knife."</p>

<p>His face darkened by the conflict of hideous passions, Fitz-Cowles rushed
past the altar, with his brandished knife, gleaming in the light. Luke stood
calm and firm, with a quiet smile playing round his thin lips. Was he resigned
for his death? Fitz-Cowles prided himself on his skill with the
bowie knife, as a butcher loves to boast of his dexterity in slaughtering an
ox. He could cut and thrust, and parry and stab, and strike and maim&mdash;a
brave man was Fitz-Cowles.</p>

<p>Two paces lay between the bravo, and Luke Harvey.</p>

<p>"Aye, dog I have you!" shouted Fitz-Cowles with a brutal sneer.</p>

<p>Luke slowly raised his right arm with the pistol in his clenched hand.</p>

<p>"These pistols are double-barreled," he coolly said. "One of them is
loaded in both barrels. You have thrown away yours: I am sorry for
you! You took your choice of the pistols awhile ago; now take your
chance from this barrel! Perhaps it's loaded, perhaps it isn't! Let this
decide!"</p>

<p>Fitz-Cowles recoiled with one sudden movement, toward the altar; Luke
drew the trigger, there was a stunning report and all was darkness! The
ball had extinguished the candle.</p>

<p>A horrid oath resounded through the darkness&mdash;"You dog I have you
at last!" spoke the hoarse voice of Fitz-Cowles, and then there was the
sound of a hurried footstep followed by a sudden crash. All was still, aye,
still as the corse beneath the coffin-lid. Luke could hear his own hard
breathing; it was the only sound that disturbed the silence of the place.
He could not see his hand before his eyes; the Chapel seemed suddenly
filled with a darkness that was thick, dense and almost tangible.</p>

<!-- page 442 -->

<p>Where was Fitz-Cowles? Luke felt a shudder creep over his frame as
he fancied the bravo, slowly dragging his form, snake-like along the floor,
in order to hew his victim down, by one sudden and unseen blow. Was he
lurking beside the altar? Luke listened; the stillness of the place was intense
and horrible.</p>

<p>In silence, and with softened footsteps, Luke receded backward, until his
extended hands touched a cold and inanimate object. It was the Image of
the dying Savior. Gliding behind the cross, Luke crouched down, and
unarmed as he was, listened for the approach of the bravo. Not a footstep
nor a voice was heard; not even the sound of half-suppressed breathing.</p>

<p>Could his last ball have taken effect? Might not the oath and threat, with
which Fitz-Cowles sprang forward, been his last? That crash was the sound
of his dead body falling to the floor in the agonies of death!</p>

<p>"I will creep forward on my hands and knees, and satisfy myself, by
the touch of his dead body!"</p>

<p>And on and on, and around and around he crept, ever searching for the
altar, and yet still as far from the object of his search, after a lapse of half
an hour, as when he first began. Have you ever found yourself, late at night
in a dark room, hunting for a door, with whose position you were familiar,
and which still, for long hours eluded your search? So Luke Harvey, creeping
over the floor of the dark chapel, sought for the altar, beside which he
expected to find the dead body of his antagonist, and yet, by some strange
chance or other, he always found himself against the bare walls, or at the
foot of the cross, or groping along the canvass of the picture which occupied
one end of the room.</p>

<p>A strange awe began to seize his soul. He sat down, with his head between
his knees, listening for the faintest echo of a sound, and at last fell
into a wild half-waking sleep, from which he was soon aroused by a roaring
noise that filled his ears like the thunder of a mighty river, breaking its way
through a deep glen, where opposing mountains meet.</p>

<p>It may have been a few minutes, or half an hour since Luke had entered
the chapel, but his strange bewilderment in the darkness and silence had
confused his idea of time, and he rose on his feet like a man struggling with
some hideous night-mare.</p>

<p>That awful roaring grew nearer and louder and more distinct; now it yelled
without the very chapel walls, and sudden as a flash from the cannon's
mouth, the darkness passed away. One entire end of the chapel was a wall
of flame; through the canvass on which was delineated the Blessed Mother
and the Holy Child, long tongues of forked fire were thrust blazing into the
place, and the dim colors glared in horrid light. Another instant, and the
whole extent of the chapel, every nook and corner, the altar and the cross,
the ceiling and the walls, were all laid bare by a sheet of streaming flame.</p>

<p>From the centre of the floor, right at the altar's foot uprose a grim and
hideous head, with long locks of elf-like hair, waving in the red light, and a

<!-- page 443 -->

distorted face, grinning like a death's-head, fired by the glare of a rolling
eye, that blazed like a coal from hot ashes. Slowly it uprose, it mocked
the eyes of the gazer with a loathsome grimace, like the grin of a mocking
devil, and then a discordant laugh yelled through the fiery air.</p>

<p>We now return to Devil-Bug, whom we left watching beside the chapel
door. The sound of the first fire had thundered on his ear, and uprising
from his crouching position, he ran along the corridor, passed down the stair,
way and through the dim hall, laughing merrily to himself all the while.</p>

<p>The hall door was wide open, but all was silent throughout the mansion.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug passed the doorway, and presently found himself among the
deserted garden walks, where winter had colored all objects with a hue of
dead, monotonous brown, while statutes thrown down from their pedestals,
and arbors crumbling to ruin, attested the decay into which Hawkewood
had fallen during the life of Albert Livingstone. Through the dark pines
which were scattered all around the mansion, Devil-Bug wandered listlessly
on, until he stood beneath the shadow of the southern wing, where one bold
mass of sombre grey stone projecting from the body of the edifice was dimly
disclosed by the starlight, in vague yet ponderous outlines. From the earth
on which Devil-Bug stood to the conical roof which surmounted this dependency
of the main edifice, the uniformity of its dark grey stone was only
broken by a solitary door opening into the garden.</p>

<p>"That must be the Chapel!" exclaimed Devil-Bug "and in the second
story them fellers is fightin' like devils&mdash;ho, hoo! Wonders how <i>that</i> 'ill
work!"</p>

<p>Passing round the mansion, Devil-Bug stood on the summit of a hill in its
rear, which affording room for a broad walk between the edifice and its brow,
sank suddenly into the glen below, where a faint gurgling sound like the
echo of a brook, choked up by weeds and withered leaves, broke on the silent
air. The pine trees on this side of the mansion were shrunken, blasted, and
withered. Through their white branches, rising coldly in the air, the starlight
fell brightly over the grey walls of the lordly structure. Devil-Bug's
heavy footsteps were echoed by the crashing of the withered leaves which
were gathered ankle-deep, around the trunks of the blasted trees. Striking
into a rude path which descended into the darkness of the glen, Devil-Bug
went slowly down, looking around upon the white trunks, rising like ghosts
on every side, with a feeling of strange awe.</p>

<p>A wild fancy seized this strange monster. He had drawn forth a cigar, and
having lighted it with the sparks from a steel and flint, falling on a piece of
decayed wood, which soon presented a small yet substantial mass of fire, he
knelt on the hard ground, while his hideous face was encircled in wreaths
of tobacco smoke. Gathering the dry leaves into a heap around the crumbling
trunk, the remnant of a fallen tree, Devil-Bug added brushwood and
broken limbs to the pile, and then chuckled grimly at his work.</p>

<!-- page 444 -->

<p>"It's cold as thunder," he exclaimed, indulging in a lively simile, "and
I'll have a bit of fire."</p>

<p>He applied the burning wood to the trunk of the tree; in a moment it took
fire, and ere Devil-Bug rose on his feet, the dry leaves were in a blaze.</p>

<p>The monster then leaped merrily up and down, executing a devil's dance
in the light of the flame.</p>

<p>"Ho-hoo!" he shouted while every lineament of his face, every point of
his figure, was changed to vivid crimson. "Ho-hoo! There they are,
there, there! The man with the broken jaw, the 'ooman with the holler
skull! There, there, a-layin' 'longside the fire, warmin' their cussed bones&mdash;uh-oo-hoo!"</p>

<p>As his wild shriek of unearthly laughter, was borne away by the wind,
the flame crept up the limbs of a withered tree, winding like a fiery serpent
around each decayed branch, until a long column of fire and smoke, shot
away into the dark blue sky. There was a howling gust of wind, sweeping
down into the glen, and from tree to tree, like a thing of life, the fire leapt,
and gathered leaves, branches and dry limbs into its fierce embrace.</p>

<p>In a few moments, Devil-Bug was surrounded by a sheet of flame.
With a wild howl, half delight, half terror, he rushed along the rude path,
he gained the summit of the hill, and looked at the fruits of his labor.
To the eastward of the mansion, far down into the glen, the whole wood
was one mass of fire. Above the sky was bloody red; beneath were whirling
waves of smoke, through which the forked flames, writhed like awful
serpents of the air, whom some wierd spell, had rendered visible to human
eye. Withered tree, reached forth its fiery arms to withered tree, the fires
sent up their flaming crests to the lurid heavens, and then a mighty roar ascended
on the still air, like the shriek of Pharoah's host, beneath the waters
of the sea.</p>

<p>With every infernal emotion, playing over his chaos of a face, mingled
with some gleams of human feeling, for the space of fifteen minutes, dancing,
hooting yelling, or standing like a block of stone, with his arms folded
over his breast, Devil-Bug watched the progress of the fire.</p>

<p>The whole eastern woods were now one wall of living flame. The winter
wind, rushing toward the east, for a few brief moments, bore the mass
of fire, in rolling waves, away toward the horizon of the rising sun.</p>

<p>Waves of flame and clouds of smoke, the blue sky above turned to burning
red, and the earth beneath changed suddenly into an ocean of fire&mdash;ho,
ho, this was a sight for Devil-Bug to gaze upon in maniac glee.</p>

<p>Suddenly the wind shifted, and the whole sea of flame, rushed with a
roar like hell, upon the roofs of the doomed mansion.</p>

<p>In an instant, the roof was wrapped in a sheet of flame. Into the windows
it rushed, along the eaves it poured, it whirled round the steep gables;
the mansion seemed an altar of molten flame.</p>

<p>"I must save that feller Luke, I must save him for the sake o' th' gal,"

<!-- page 445 -->

screeched Devil-Bug "Hello! There's a window in the east o' that
Chapel, the fire nears it, quick, quick old boy or all is lost!"</p>

<p>Half-stifled by clouds of smoke, Devil-Bug ran round to the western front
of the mansion. At his back, roared and whirled the sea of flame; over
his head, it tossed in burning waves.</p>

<p>With one glance, he saw that all hope of entrance by the hall-door was
vain; he looked to the door of the southern wing: to his astonishment he
found its huge panels, laid prostrate at his feet.</p>

<p>It was no time for thought! Rushing through the arching doorway,
Devil-Bug, by the light of a sudden flash of flame, beheld the massive walls
of a grave-vault with three coffins, placed at regular intervals on solid blocks
of stone. He saw these coffins, and a cloud of smoke, wrapt the place in
darkness. Another flash of flame, and in the centre of the vault, rising
from the stone floor to the arching ceiling, he beheld the outlines of a rude
ladder, placed in the aperture of a small trap-door.</p>

<p>"Hello! Here's fun for an old boy like me! One o' them fellers has
killed th' t'other in the chapel up stairs, and the door bein' locked he's got
off, by this trap-door and ladder ho, hoo! I must satisfy my mind! If
Luke's killed all's up with the g-al! Fire away curse you, and smoke
away, who keers?"</p>

<p>He rushed toward the ladder, he ascended its rounds, and in a moment,
passing through the narrow trap-door, his sight was blinded by one quivering
sheet of flame. The hot fire smote his brain, with a pang like death
he yelled in agony; and then a wild shriek of infernal laughter burst from
his lips. He beheld the picture, tossed in fragments, on the sheets of flame
he beheld the Image of Jesus, turned to dazzling crimson by the blinding
light, he saw the figure crouching at the foot of the cross.</p>

<p>"Luke," he shrieked rushing forward, "Save yerself! There's hell
around us, above us, below us! Hurr-a-h! This is wot I likes&mdash;but come,
my feller! Save yerself for the sake o' the gal!"</p>

<p>"The key!" shouted Luke, springing on his feet and pointing to the door.</p>

<p>"This way," exclaimed Devil-Bug. "Thro' that trap-door down th'
ladder&mdash;hurry!"</p>

<p>"The key!" thundered Luke, with fierce gesture. "The key! Quick
I say!"</p>

<p>"Take it, and to the devil with you!" screamed Devil-Bug, flinging the
key at Luke's feet.</p>

<p>As though his soul hung on that instant's deeds, Luke seized the key,
unlocked the door, and his form was lost in a cloud of smoke, that filled
the chapel.</p>

<p>"Ven he gits in the middle o' th' fire and can't breathe ho, ho!
Wonders how that 'ill vork?" And with a wild laugh Devil-Bug retreated
to the trap-door.</p>

<p>The lonely corridor, yet free from flame but obscured by smoke, re-echoed

<!-- page 446 -->

to Luke Harvey's footsteps. His heart was in his throat, as he
darted onward. In an instant the stairs were gained. Thank God! They
were free from the lurid flame, or stifling smoke. With one bound Luke
rushed up the steps of massive oak, he stood on the landing in front of the
Oak Chamber. At that very instant the glass of the eastern window, fell
crashing at his feet; he was surrounded by a cloud of black and choking
smoke. Stifled by the heat, he leaned against one of the posts of the Oak
Chamber door, and a sudden gust of wind bore smoke and flame, out through
the window in the fiery air once more.</p>

<p>Luke gazed into the Oak Chamber; one wild and horror stricken look,
and all was smoke and flame again.</p>

<p>That gaze, that look of a moment&mdash;great God! Let its horror never be
told to living man! Accursed be the lips that murmur it, accursed the pen
that pictures it! Luke gave one look and a mass of flame rose up between
him and the horrid vision; he gave one look, and his heart died within him!</p>

<p>Let us pray to Heaven that what he then beheld was only a fearful dream
engendered by the smoke and heat!</p>

<p>That arm uplifted, that frown, that kneeling form, that tide of gushing
blood&mdash;&mdash;hush! Never, never to human ears may that sight be told. It
was a dream, yes, yes, only a dream! But that scream, that shriek, gurgling
from the smoke and flame&mdash;did ever human thing, ridden by the horrors
of madness, fancy a shriek like that?</p>

<p>Only one look, and yet to see a sight, which it were blasphemy to tell!
Only one look, and yet to have one's heart forever blasted by its memory!</p>

<p>Pursued by smoke and flame, Luke rushed down the stairway; over crackling
timbers and through waves of fire he gained the hall door; as though
a fiend was at his shoulder, flinging his arms aloft, he rushed through the
grove of burning pines toward the mansion gate.</p>

<p>Three human figures stood on the rising knoll, an aged man and withered
woman, but half sheltered from the night by their scanty apparel, and there
holding the reins of two plunging horses in his iron hands, a grim monster,
stood at their backs.</p>

<p>With a face like ashes, Luke sprang upon his horse. Not a word passed
from his lips, but casting one vacant glance at the sea of flame, roaring
around the doomed house, he dashed down the road with the speed of wind.</p>

<p>Not once did he look back, until five miles lay between him and the roofs
of Hawkewood. From the summit of a gentle hill, he gazed backward upon
scene, and as he gazed the form of Devil-Bug, clinging like a toad to the
neck of a foaming steed, was at his side.</p>

<p>"Ho, hoo! You're a purty feller to leave an old man and 'ooman to be
burnt up, ain't you now? If it hadn't been for me they'd a-been roasted,
sartin as hell is blazin' yonder! Ho, hoo! I does wonder how that 'ill
vork!"</p>

<p>He pointed to the world of flame, and his screech-owl laugh broke like a
fiend's yell on the air.</p>

<!-- page 447 -->

<p>It was an awful sight, awful and sublime as though the Book of Revelations
had started into action. The entire eastern horizon was one wall of flame,
dark purple, and bright red, and dazzling crimson, mingled together, with a
chaos of smoke rolling up to the sky in awful folds, pile on pile to the very
zenith.</p>

<p>Chasm and plain, orchard and farm-house, ravine and dell, lay bared to
the eye in a blaze, brighter than the noon-day sun. Then the roar of the
flames, like the groan of millions or the last convulsive throw of an expiring
world; how it swelled in awful volume, how it shrieked through mountains
of smoke, how it filled all space!</p>

<p>I have stood in the streets of the Quaker City, while a fierce mob, hungry
for blood, howled onward, their ten thousand faces glaring in the light of a
burning church, whose dome went up to Heaven in clouds of smoke and
waves of fire. I have heard their yell of mocking triumph as the cross of
Jesus tottered from its proud height, quivered for a moment, and then fell
plunging into the abyss of flame!</p>

<p>But here, was neither church nor cross, nor frenzied mob. All was Solitary
Desolation. Not a breath of fanaticism to fan the flame, nor yet the
visage of a grim Bigot, grinning at the work of ruin.</p>

<p>All was fire and smoke and solitude. Far over the land, far along the
wide horizon, the forests lapped in sheets of fire, sent their greeting to the
sky, as though they yelled in triumph, beneath the wild career of Desolation.</p>

<p>"Never, never, never!" muttered Luke in a tone of whispered horror.
"Never to be spoken by human lips to human ears! Only one look, and
yet that sight! Oh, God&mdash;tear it from my soul, tear it from my heart, this
awful memory! Better to die stretched on the rope of a gibbet, than to have
this Phantom ever brooding over my soul! That frown, that uplifted hand,
that kneeling form&mdash;&mdash;never, never, never to living man shall it be spoken!"</p>

<p>He dashed the spurs in the flanks of his steed, and without once looking
back on the sea of flame, sped madly onward, while the distorted form of
Devil-Bug rode at his horse's heels, like some laughing Demon in pursuit of
his victim.</p>

<p>CHAPTER FIFTH.</p>

<p class="small">THE TEMPLE OF RAVONI.</p>

</div>

<p>WHITE columns of incense, rolled in soft and curling folds, through the
temple to the arching dome, from whose azure expanse, innumerable lights
glittered like stars in a clear sky. The sound of a low-toned and absorbing
music floated through the smoke of the incense, and the breath of flowers
filled the air. Through the intervals of the snowy columns, filling that wide
temple, with shapes of fantastic splendor, you might see the forms of beautiful

<!-- page 448 -->

women, moving in a gliding dance, their limbs encircled by a light and
flowing drapery.</p>

<p>Then a wilderness of flowers, sweet as May or gorgeous as autumn, broke
on your eye, with here and there a fountain of clear water, rising in the
light, and sprinkling its spray drops in the air, with a murmur of rippling
music. Then the columns of incense, closed upon the vision of flowers and
fountain, veiling the forms of beautiful women, in its robes of snowy whiteness,
while the light from the azure dome, gave a thousand hues, a thousand
fairy shapes, to the wreaths of fragrant mist, as they swept through the
temple, or broke among the pillars, or rolled away to the arching roof.</p>

<p>From the bosom of those snowy clouds, come the sound of women's feet,
sweeping over the floor, to a low and soft-toned measure, while the murmur
of fountains, mingled with the harp and viol, and the air grew heavy with
the perfumes of incense, overpowering for a moment, the fragrance of innumerable
flowers.</p>

<p>Suddenly the columns of smoke died away, and a scene like some
dream of enchantment, was laid bare to the eye.</p>

<p>In the centre of the place, around an altar of snow-white marble, were
grouped a crowd of maidens, whose beauty was like the blushing dawn, or
solemn eve, on still midnight, various, contrasted and enchanting. Between
this crowd of beauty and the altar, knelt some twenty-four young men,
whose thoughtful faces, and flashing eyes, were in vivid constraint, with the
long white robes, that fell round their well-proportioned forms. On the
other side of the altar, with a beautiful maiden by his side, stood a man of
strange beauty, his light yet muscular form, clad in a tunic of black velvet,
reaching to his knees, while from the floor, some few faces at his back,
arose a tent with white silken curtains, waving to and fro, in the dazzling
light of the dome.</p>

<p>Around the scene, the strange man and the maiden, the cluster of kneeling
men, and the group of beautiful women, swept the twelve marble pillars
of the temple, describing the circular form of the place, and supporting the
roof of the white dome, from whose azure expanse, twinkled and fell, the
glare of innumerable lights.</p>

<p>Twelve massive pillars of dark-hued marble rose from the variegated floor,
to the dome above, and around each pillar, were clustered vases of solid
stone, filled with rare and beautiful flowers, mingling their hues and perfume,
while they rustled gently in the light. Here was the rose, from the
vales of Persia, the lily from the clear waters of some Ethiopian lake, the
gorgeous flower of Montezuma, from the wilds of Mexican deserts. Here
too, from amid rich green leaves, the hue and shape of luscious fruit, were
thrust into light, the golden orange and the yellow lime, the purple grape
hanging in clusters, and the blushing peach, bending beneath the weight of
its own ripeness. Fruits and flowers of every clime, ripened and bloomed
around the massive pillars of that gorgeous temple.</p>

<!-- page 449 -->

<p>Beyond these pillars, was a cloistered space, but dimly penetrated by the
light, yet full of music and beauty. In the interval between each pillar,
arose a gentle fountain of clear water, darting upward through the dim air,
and falling into a basin of snow-white marble, with an almost inaudible
murmur. Twelve fountains showering into the dim air, that lay beyond the
pillars, mingled their murmurs and filled the temple with a soft and lulling
melody, like the hum of bees, revelling amid the perfume of intoxicating
flowers. And the song of birds, faint and chirping, or rich, full and gushing,
came from the dimness of the cloister, blending with the murmur of the
fountains, or rising in distinct melody to the echoing dome.</p>

<p>His dark hair, falling to his shoulders, his brow glowing with a strange
joy, his olive cheek flushed with the hues of immortal youth, Ravoni stood
between the silken tent and the altar, looking with the same expression of
triumph on the young face of the maiden, by his side, the kneeling enthusiasts
extending along the floor, and the forms of the lovely women, clustering
around in attitudes of grace and beauty.</p>

<p>Well might Ravoni, gaze upon these beaming faces and graceful forms,
with his dark eye dilating with mingled triumph and admiration. Here
were the beauties of the world, called from cottage, harem and hall. That
maiden yonder, whose supple form is clad in light drapery reaching to her
knees, whose dark brown cheek, blushes with the ripeness of her native
skies, whose raven hair is tinged with a shade of glossy blue, whose lips
are luscious red; need you ask the name of the land, from which this blossom
sprung? A child of fair skies and sunny waters, a child of deep
groves, fragrant with tropical fruits, a daughter of Hindoostan, whom Ravoni's
hand sixteen years ago, rescued from the waters of the Ganges, while the
animal mother, the murderer of her infant, stood looking on, with a smile.</p>

<p>That queenly woman, with the tall form, the fair skin, the dark eyes, and
the rich brown hair? The child of old Virginia, entrusted by rich parents,
to the care of Doctor Ravoni! By her side, that sweet young girl, with a
form so fragile, and yet so beautiful, with a vacant blue eye, and sunny
clusters of golden hair falling over a neck like a snow-flake? The warm
skies of Carolina, laugh in her eye and in her smile. Here, in fine, are
shapes from all the world, shapes of living, breathing, beaming loveliness!
The Creole from New Orleans, with limbs of voluptuous softness, an eye,
so dark, so melting, so full of passion, revenge and madness; the mild
beauty of the British isle, with a skin like snow, warmed with a flush of
daybreak; the warm maiden of Spain, with her olive cheek and flashing
eye; the faultless forms of many a Grecian isle, and the heaving bosoms
of Circassia; the cherry lips of Pennsylvania, and the blue eyes and sunny
locks of Germany, these all were mingled in that crowd of loveliness and
beauty.</p>

<p>Well might the smile of triumph wreathe the dark red lip of Ravoni!
There, amid this cluster of lovely women, were the daughters of rich and

haughty families, whose broad lands lay in the far scattered states of the
American Union, whose magnificent mansions, lined the streets of many a
town, and city, in North and South and West; in the peopled Centre and
on the forest borders. They had been sent to the <i>Mad-Doctor</i> Ravoni,
whose reputation for skill in all cases of Insanity, was without a parallel.</p>

<p>Here they were, grouped around the altar of Ravoni, mingled among the
forms of his harem, alike the dupes of his will and instruments of his power,
here they were, the willing slaves of his magnetic glance; but ere you
drop a tear for the fate of these <i>patients of the Mad-Doctor</i>, let me raise up
before your eyes, the shadow of a horrid wrong, which is done every day
in this good Quaker City, and every hour in the day, under the solemn
sanction of the Law.</p>

<p>Let me point your vision, to the grim cells of that Legal Mad-House,
a reckless Charlatan administers his brutal rule, in damp cells, littered
by straw, amid the glorious panoply of chains and bolts and bars!
Let me picture to you, this pitiless Quack, standing lash in hand, over the
prostrate body of some insane wretch, while his band of brutal ruffians,
stand ready to do his will, even though that will be slow and deliberate murder.
When you have taken in the full details of the picture, when you have impressed
on your mind the fact, that this Quack and his Mad-House are both
the creatures of your Statute-books, that sane men have been dragged into
their clutches, by designing relatives, and kept chained and lashed, until
insanity came to their relief, followed by sudden death; <i>then</i> quarrel
with the Mad-House of the Sorcerer! Even now as I write, there rises before
me, the records of a judicial investigation, which gave to this Legal
Mad-House, all the horrors of the Bastile, in its most gory hour!</p>

<p>The dark eyes of Ravoni were fixed upon the face of the maiden who
stood by his side. It was a pale face, aye pale and white as snow, yet full
of health, and beaming with a strange life. In thick masses her raven-black
hair, streamed over her shoulders, while her dark eyes, had but one look,
one gaze, and that was centred upon the face of Ravoni.</p>

<p>"Here amid the breath of flowers, the lull of fountains, and the song of
birds, do I consecrate the Priestess of our New Faith! On this white brow
I place the crown of flowers: may thy soul fair maiden be pure for evermore,
pure and stainless as these lilies, thy heart young and warm forever
as these buds of the opening rose! Arise and hail the virgin Izol&eacute;, arise
and hail the Priestess of our New Faith!"</p>

<p>Slowly the enthusiasts arose, but not a murmur passed from their parted
lips. Izol&eacute; stood before them, like a thing of air, so pure, so fair, and so
serenely beautiful. Each dark eye, was fixed upon her in a look of reverence
like religious worship.</p>

<p>Ravoni waved his hand, and the crowd of beautiful women, went, whirling
over the floor, while the sound of the harp and viol, arose merrily on the

<!-- page 451 -->

air. The murmur of fountains, and the song of birds was mingled with the
light tripping sound of women's feet, while the light from the dome shone
over a scene of bewitching fascination. Now circling in groups of two and
three, their bounding limbs, stirring the light drapery, which but faintly
veiled the glory of each shape, the beauty of each heaving bosom, or again
sweeping round the altar and the tent, in one breathing mass of loveliness,
each fair arm, raised gently in the light, while they glided over the floor,
their forms undulating to the impulse of soft and murmuring music.&mdash;They
were worthy of Moslem's heaven, these women of Ravoni!</p>

<p>"These are the forms of Sense and Passion," exclaimed Ravoni. "They
speak not, but as I will, they have no soul, but mine! This"&mdash;and his
dark eye was centred on the face of Izol&eacute;&mdash;"This is a form of pure and
spiritual loveliness. In this sweet form, in this mild face, beaming such unutterable
love, behold the Incarnation of our Faith!"</p>

<p>Not a word from the Disciples; not a murmur from Izol&eacute;. They had but
one eye, and that was centred on her face; her dark eyes had but one glance,
and that was chained to the flashing eyes of Ravoni.</p>

<p>"From time to time, through every age, and in every clime, there have
appeared on the earth, fair maidens, whose delicate organization, warming
with life, yet full of spiritual beauty, indicates their holy mission. They endure
persecution, they suffer wrong, their childhood is one bitter pang.
Friendless and alone they walk the earth, while their souls are in the Future,
while their thoughts dwell with indefinable longing on the hope of another
world, hidden in the bosom of space. These are the chosen of God! It is
unto such as these, that the AWFUL SUPREME, gently manifests his will.
Look, my children, around you cluster fair and beautiful women, the light
from yon dome, falls on heaving bosoms and glowing cheeks. Are these
the chosen of God! Never! Creatures of Sense, their animal organization
reveals their nature. But this fair creature standing by my side, this Image
of pure thought whose dark eyes I now hold enchained with my glance,
tell me, is she not the chosen of the Eternal? As I speak behold her eyes
fire with Prophecy, her lips part in wonder as the prospect of the Future
rushes on her soul!"</p>

<p>The twenty-four believers in the New Faith knelt down in silence. Grouping
around them in attitudes of voluptuous grace, were the beauties of all the
world, their vacant eyes fixed in wonder on the face of Ravoni. The lull of
fountains, the murmur of birds, the perfume of flowers; these all were in the air.</p>

<p>"What see'st thou?" spoke the deep voice of Ravoni, and his dark eye
shot a fixed gleam into the eyes of the Priestess.</p>

<p>Her form dilated, her right hand rose gently overhead, her lips parted, and
with her dark eyes filled with wonder and awe, Izol&eacute; gazed on the vacant air.</p>

<p>"I am in a large city, whose domes arise into the blue sky. The streets
are filled with free and happy people. There are no rich; there are no poor;
I see neither church nor gaol, priest nor gaoler, yet&mdash;yet&mdash;all are happy!"</p>

<!-- page 452 -->

<p>"This is OUR FAITH! No rich, no poor, no priests, no gaolers! Look,
again Izol&eacute;! What see'st thou?"</p>

<p>"A man has dyed his hands in murder. His victim lays at his feet, and
the crowd circle round with pale faces. Hark! They whisper and point to
the date on yonder edifice. '<i>The two-hundredth year of the Independence
of Man's Soul!</i>' 'Since then,' they whisper, 'there have been but two murders
in our land.' Murder to them, is no familiar thing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do they drag the murderer to the gallows, or to the solitary cell, where
madness digs its fangs into the victim's soul?"</p>

<p>"There are neither gaol nor gibbet in the land! Hush! Hear you that
cry of madness! He begs them to slay him; he cries for the mercy of the
sword or gibbet! In that city of happy people, he feels himself accursed.
He rises&mdash;none lifts a hand to molest him. He shrieks&mdash;the face of his dead
victim haunts him like a curse! He goes to his home&mdash;his friends and
neighbors gather round him, they seek to comfort him. Hark that voice!
'Crime is a disease to be cured, not an ulcer to be cut off!' "</p>

<p>"See'st thou no place of worship, where prayers are made to the Eternal
God?"

<p>"Come&mdash;come&mdash;with a gentle footstep&mdash;come! Cross we this peaceful
threshold! A father, a wife and little children! They sit in their own
home, with the free air blowing through the windows, and God's sun shining
in their faces. Here is their place of worship&mdash;HOME!"</p>

<p>"And from whence comes this peace, this mercy, this Religion of Home?"</p>

<p>"Lo! we are in the streets again. Two citizens meet in the pathway;
they greet each other with familiar salutations, but that silent grasp of each
other's hand, that mystic sign, made by each upon his forehead? What
means that grasp, that sign? They are Brothers of the Secret Order of Ravoni,
established two hundred years ago. The very existence of this band
is deemed a fable by the mass of men, but in silence and in secrecy, by the
children of the Faith, has this great peace and mercy and this Religion of
Home, been brought to light!"</p>

<p>"This Faith&mdash;what is it?"</p>

<p>"Hope to Man!" exclaimed the Priestess as her hand rose in the air, and
her dark eye flashed with thoughts of unutterable meaning.</p>

<p>"Hail Ravoni! We love thy Faith, we are Brothers of thy Order! It is a
Prophecy! Hail Ravoni&mdash;hail! We worship thee!"</p>

<p>With a murmur of awe, the Disciples of Ravoni rose from the floor, they
encircled the altar, the Master and the Maiden, and stood with uplifted hands,
while the crowd of beautiful women whirled dancing around the scene, and
the lull of fountains and the song of birds mingled with the cry, "Hail Ravoni&mdash;we
worship thee!"</p>

<p>The Sorcerer turned from the band of enthusiasts, and tossed aside the
hangings of the silken tent, which arose in the full light of the dome.</p>

<p>"Behold the arisen dead!" he exclaimed, while a murmur of surprise

<!-- page 453 -->

spread through the group. Fair and beautiful as some dream which comes
over the half-waking soul, in the voluptuous softness of a summer's sunset,
a maiden form lay reclining on a couch of light crimson velvet, her white
robes displaying in easy folds, the womanly symmetry of her shape. Her
glowing cheek rested on her full round arm, while the hand lay softly on her
bosom, rising and falling with the gentle impulse of slumber. The hair
which fell in flowing masses around her face, was bright, silken and glossy,
like the hue of sunbeams bathing the crest of a rippling billow.</p>

<p>"She has arisen from death, but she still lingers in a state of Trance," said
Ravoni, passing his hand gently along her forehead, while his dark eyes
flashed with light, like a living flame. "Arise, maiden arise! Arise and
speak to the children of the faith, the revelations made to thee, while thy soul,
freed from the body, soared in the realms of Trance!"</p>

<p>The maiden slowly unclosed her eyes of a light and liquid azure, the Disciples
clustered closer around the altar, waiting the anticipated revelation
with interest and awe, while Ravoni stood gazing upon the countenance of
the light-haired girl with an expression that indicated his powerful Will, concentred
on a single object, with deep and absorbing intensity.</p>

<p>"Speak maiden," said Ravoni in his voice of low-toned music.</p>

<p>The murmur on the lips of the girl, mingled with the sound of footsteps
resounding from either side of the temple. With one start, the Disciples of
Ravoni, and the crowd of beautiful women, turned their gaze from side to
side, while the forms of the intruders advanced into the glare of the light.</p>

<p>"Annie!" shrieked a voice, hoarse with emotion, and a young man,
whose long dark hair, fell waving aside, from a pale face, stamped with the
traces of an agony, like madness, came rushing from the cloister, with wild
and unsteady footsteps.</p>

<p>The maiden reclining within the folds of the tent beheld him, she rose
from the couch with a faint murmur, and as he rushed forward, through
the group of enthusiasts she raised her arms aloft, and sunk senseless into
his embrace.</p>

<p>"Ha! Our young enthusiast hath arisen from his slumber," muttered
Ravoni, as he gazed upon the face of Byrnewood Arlington. "But lover
and maiden, both shall minister to my Will!"</p>

<p>As he spoke the dome was filled with a sound like the howl of an enraged
hyena. Every eye was turned toward the opposite side of the temple, and
the light fell upon a deformed shape, rushing wildly over the floor, with
head half-sunken between the shoulders, and long arms with fingers like
talons, flung quivering in the air. That face with the wide mouth, the teeth
fixedly compressed, the eyeless socket and the blazing eye&mdash;Ravoni knew
it well, and knew that now was the time, for the exertion of his utmost
power.</p>

<p>"The gal!" shrieked, the voice of Devil-Bug, as he strode rapidly toward
the altar. "Wizard, give me that gal, or&mdash;or&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 454 -->

<p>His teeth churned with rage, and the white foam hung round his huge
lips. He stood with heavy chest and a burning eye, gazing steadily in the
face of Ravoni. The same start of fear quivered through the Disciples and
the women of Ravoni. With one impulse they recoiled from the altar,
leaving the Master Sorcerer to confront the monster, who stood before him.</p>

<p>Gently gathering his arm, around the waist of Izol&eacute;, the Priestess and the
maiden, Ravoni fixed the glance of his dark eye upon the face of Devil-Bug.
The Savage looked from one to the other, first on the pale face of Izol&eacute;,
then in dark the countenance of the Sorcerer, he raised his arms aloft, with a
cry of vengeance, he sprung forward. A murmur of horror escaped from
the lips of the Disciples. Devil-Bug sprung forward, his hands quivering,
and his eye flashing, but the calm dark eye of Ravoni was fixed upon him,
he made an effort to overcome the witch of that burning glance, he
clutched his brawny chest with his talon fingers, and then fell back recoiling
on one knee.</p>

<p>"Gi' me the gal, Wizard, only gi' me the gal," he moaned, looking upward
with a subdued and pitiful glance, "Gi' me the gal, an' I'll be your slave!
I'll murder, stab and burn for yo'&mdash;I'll be yer slave for life&mdash;I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;only
gi' me the gal wizard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Slave!" the sneer quivered on the thin lips of Ravoni&mdash;"Know you,
that the man who treads this floor unbidden, has doomed himself to death?
Begone, or from this temple walls, you will never pass again, but as a corse!"</p>

<p>"Impostor!" shouted a sneering voice, at the back of Devil-Bug. "Juggler
and knave! Resign this girl to me, or I will teach you the wholesome
discipline, which Judge <i>Lynch</i> awards to strolling vagabonds&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ravoni raised his glance, and beheld the tall form of Luke Harvey,
standing at the back of Devil-Bug, his dark eyes flashing and his thin lip
quivering with scorn.</p>

<p>"Come juggler," sneered Luke, advancing, "Resign the girl to me,
without delay. If you have so much as injured a hair of her head, you
shall answer for it with your blood."</p>

<p>He extended his arms; Izol&eacute; shrunk back from his touch.</p>

<p>Ravoni made no reply to the sneer, and the threat, but his olive cheek
flushed with deep emotion, and his black eye dilating, suddenly absorbed
the space between the brow and cheek-bone, but an instant ago, occupied by
the fringed eyelid. The Sorcerer presented a terrible picture of superhuman
anger. The sneer died on Luke's lip; with an involuntary start, he recoiled
a step backward, and stood like a man awaking from a dream.</p>

<p>"Izol&eacute; is free!" exclaimed Ravoni, in a tone of marked calmness, "Why
do you not advance, and claim your prize? Maiden thou wilt go with this
man, wilt thou not?"</p>

<p>A look of deep emotion passed over Luke's face, as he gazed upon the
beautiful countenance of Izol&eacute;.</p>

<p>"Maiden," he exclaimed, "Your father's last word, consigned you to

<!-- page 455 -->

my care! I swore a solemn oath, to guard and protect you, at the hazard
of my life. Come with me. There is danger for you in this place, danger
worse than death&mdash;"</p>

<p>As these low pleading tones fell on the ear of the maiden, Devil-Bug
crawled softly along the floor, and plucking the skirt of her white robe,
looked up beseechingly in her face.</p>

<p>"Come gal," he muttered, "You shall roll in wealth&mdash;you shall wear
silks an' satins&mdash;Come gal! This feller's a wizard an' a devil, leave him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go with them!" said Ravoni, and he unwound his arm from her waist.</p>

<p>Izol&eacute; stood alone in front of the altar. She looked around with a glance
of mysterious meaning. Her eyes were veiled in a mist-like film, that gave
them a wild and glassy stare. First she gazed in the face of Devil-Bug,
and some memory of the past, seemed to give its light to her bewildered
soul. Then her eyes encountered the gaze of Luke Harvey, and a murmur
of joy, burst from her lips. She advanced toward him with a smile.</p>

<p>"I will go with you," she said, "Lead me to my father&mdash;" The words
died suddenly on her lips. Her eyes met the glance of Ravoni with a soft
gliding motion, she swam to his arms.</p>

<p>"With thee!" she whispered, placing a fair hand on each shoulder, and
looking up into his face. "With thee forever!"</p>

<p>At that moment Ravoni's face was sublime! Gazing down into the countenance
of the fair young girl, whose bosom heaved against his chest, whose
soft hands rested warmly on his shoulders, a smile broke over his face, and
his dark eye grew radiant with delight.</p>

<p>"Izol&eacute;," he whispered in a voice, whose tones were music, "Chosen of
God, called to the altar, whose faith is hope to man, thy name shall yet
linger on the lips of millions, a sound of blessing and praise! Here from
the solemn temple, here from these hearts of fire, shall go forth, a new
religion, like the faith which in long past ages, gathered men, in the city
and the plain, in the mountain and the dell, as brothers&mdash;children of one God,
worshippers of the majesty of Eternity without tithe, or priest or fane!"</p>

<p>"Hail Ravoni!" shouted the band of enthusiasts, and the group of lovely
women, the vacant-eyed maniacs and the voluptuous forms of Ravoni's
harem, went whirling over the floor in a bounding dance. Looking upon
their Master with deep reverence, these forms of animal loveliness without
soul, regarded this strange scene, but as a part of the mysterious ceremonies
of Ravoni. Kneeling on the floor beside the silken tent, Byrnewood Arlington
with the senseless form of Annie, gathered in his embrace, looked up
in vacant wonder.</p>

<p>"The maiden hath chosen," said Ravoni turning to Luke with a calm
smile. Devil-Bug rose silently to his feet, and stood at the back of the
Sorcerer, gazing with a wild stare, in the face of Izol&eacute;, as she hung fascinated
on the very look of Ravoni. The Savage placed his hand within the

<!-- page 456 -->

breast of his coarse garment, and his gaze wandered from the form of the
Sorcerer, to the face of the girl.</p>

<p>"She hath chosen," repeated Ravoni, with that same calm smile, as he
gazed on the wondering face of Luke. "She hath&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words were half-uttered, when looking over Luke's shoulder, into a
large mirror, that hung between two columns on the opposite side of the
temple, he beheld a sight that froze his blood. He beheld a huge hand, rising
above his head, with a glittering knife, grasped in the clutch of talon
fingers. It was aimed at the bosom of Izol&eacute;!</p>

<p>One look into the mirror, the glance of a single moment, and Ravoni
started forward, to shield her bosom from the blow. He started forward, a
hoarse laugh broke on the air, mingled with a deep groan of agony! The
knife had entered the back of Ravoni, driven with all the force of a frenzied
arm, it sunk into the flesh between the shoulder blades, the Sorcerer felt the
keen point at his heart, he grew purple in the face and pale by turns, he
quivered from head to foot, he tottered along the floor, he fell.</p>

<p>He fell, and lay a mass of palpitating agony, at the maiden's feet, while
Devil-Bug shook his gory hands aloft, with a burst of horrid laughter.</p>

<p>"Gal, I've saved you, saved you! Ho-hoo!"</p>

<p>The band of enthusiasts stood thunder-stricken; the shriek of the women
of the harem, mingled with the hollow laugh of the maniacs; Byrnewood
Arlington laid the form of the insensible girl, within the folds of the tent, he
started up, and gazed upon the scene.</p>

<p>There on the floor, quivering in the agonies of an awful soul wrestling
with death, there lay the mighty man, Ravoni the Sorcerer! The wierd
Sorcerer whose magic was in his look, whose sorcery was in his tone!
Now his hands clutched madly at the marble floor, now his knees touched
his chin, and then his head fell backward on his shoulders, his back bent
inwards with mental agony, and the soles of his feet, were hidden in the
thick curls of his long dark hair. Pale, purple, livid and ashy, all hues by
sudden turns, the eyes starting from their sockets and the white lips clenched
between his teeth, his face was too fearful to look upon, his agony too horrible
for mortal man, to behold.</p>

<p>With one yell, the enthusiasts rushed upon the murderer; he dashed them
back with his weaponless hands, answering their yell, with shrieks of fiendish
laughter.</p>

<p>"He'd a-made a nun o' th' gal, would he? Ho-hoo! Not while old
Devil-Bug had a knife to stab, or a hand to strike! There lays yer Wizard,
wrigglin' like a frog, yo' dogs and fools! Where's his eye now? Where's
his deviltry and witchcraft&mdash;ho, hoo!"</p>

<p>The Orphan maiden gazed upon the quivering form of Ravoni, her eyes
rolled wildly to and fro, her heart grew icy, she fell insensible into Luke
Harvey's arms.</p>

<p>Again the Disciples of Ravoni rushed upon the murderer of their Lord;

<!-- page 457 -->

there was a struggle, and the dome gave back the echo of mingled shrieks
and yells.</p>

<p>"Back! Touch him not!" spoke a calm deliberate voice. The enthusiasts
started in wonder. Their Master with his dying form supported on
one arm, raised his head, and gazed calmly over the faces of his disciples.</p>

<p>"I am dying," he said as a glow like life, warmed over his livid face,
"but do not harm my murderer!"</p>

<p>It was the voice, so low-toned, so soft, so musical, that they had heard in
many a by-gone hour. Tears fell from their flashing eyes, groans of anguish
heaved their manly bosoms. Silently they gathered round their dying
master, Luke Harvey with the form of the insensible Izol&eacute;, the Priestess
and the maiden gathered in his arms, was there, amid that group of dark-eyed
fanatics, and there stood Byrnewood Arlington gazing in mute awe
upon the awful face of Ravoni. And there, his solitary eye, blazing with a
vacant horror, as he gazed upon his victim, there stood Devil-Bug, his long
arms dropped listlessly by his side. In the background grouping in fear
together, were the women of the harem and the maniacs of the Mad-House,
all alike beautiful, all alike stricken dumb with a strange horror.</p>

<p>"My children I am dying," he said, and for a moment his dark eyes
flashed, as though he was about to speak in the calm voice of the by-gone
time, but his head dropped, his lip quivered, and his gaze was fixed upon
the floor.</p>

<p>In that moment a Voice within him, spoke to his Soul, words of deep and
awful interest.</p>

<p>"One moment of awful thought! Stern believer in Annihilation, man of
immortal manhood, suddenly hurled from thy proud eminence of eternal
youth, has the grave its terrors for thee? Is there a hereafter? Look, beyond
the veil of time and life, look&mdash;&mdash;is there another world? Thine eyes
are opening upon the secrets of death, tell us, oh man of fearful will and
magic look, tell us, what hopes break on thee, what visions affright or enrapture
thy soul, what is the prospect of eternity? No answer, no murmur!
Ask thine inmost soul!</p>

<p>"All black, dull, dead! Vacant space, darkness, nothingness! Darkness,
darkness, darkness! A thousand whispering tongues from the midst of
clouds repeat that word&mdash;darkness!</p>

<p>"Annihilation! Oh, God, the terrors of hell, the gnawings of eternal torture,
anything but this nothingness! To die, to die like a brute of the field,
to be thought and soul to-day, dust and worse than dust, reeking corruption,
to-morrow!"</p>

<p>Such were the thoughts that shook Ravoni's soul, in that solitary moment,
as he lay with his dying form resting on his bent arm, while his dark eyes
glared fixedly on the floor.</p>

<p>"And shall I, because this awful scene of Eternal Nothingness presses on
my soul, like a raven on the corse of the battle-slain, shall I play the craven,

<!-- page 458 -->

shall these lips murmur words of drivelling penitence? Never, never! It
is my last hour, but my soul shall go out, in glory!"</p>

<p>"Lift me my children, lift me on my feet once again," he exclaimed aloud,
in a calm deliberate voice. They raised him on his feet; he stood erect supported
by the arms of his disciples.</p>

<p>"When I give the signal, then draw the knife from the wound, and let
me die!" he cried, while his form became once more erect, even as the students,
encircled him with their arms. His eye blazed with all its former fire
his lip curled with the proud enthusiasm of the by-gone time. He looked
beautiful, even beyond the beauty of this earth. His dark hair fell waving
aside from his brow, tossed gently to and fro by a cool breath of air that
came from the dim cloisters. For a moment all was still, save the lull of
fountains, the voice of birds, and half-suppressed breathing of living men.</p>

<p>"I die," said Ravoni in that voice of music, "I die but I shall live again!
When I am dead, I charge ye all, take my body, and let it be burned to
ashes! In my most secret chamber, you will find a cabinet of ebony. Within
this cabinet is deposited a volume written by my own hand, a volume of
parchment, on whose leaves are inscribed the words of the New Faith. There,
you will discover the sublime truths on which the Brotherhood of Ravoni
will arise! From those pages will dawn upon you, the secrets of the olden
sages, which the present age in its vain unbelief, deems but tradition and
fable; the secret of gold, and the secret of immortal youth. Take this dying
hand, and swear to do, as with my last breath, I command&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hand after hand was pressed upon those icy fingers. In a few brief
moments, each fanatic of the twenty-four, had taken the oath. Why does
Byrnewood start, tremble and turn pale? He felt his soul drawn toward the
soul of the dying man, by an irresistible influence. He too advanced, he too
reached forth his hand, but ere he could grasp the hand of Ravoni, that
voice of strange enthusiasm broke on the air again.</p>

<p>"Take the knife in thy hand," he said to a student, whose bronzed face
with brilliant dark eyes, deeply sunk beneath a massive brow, was like the
incarnation of an enthusiastic soul&mdash;&mdash;"When I give the signal, draw it
from the wound, and let me die! When I am dead, let my body be burned.
From my ashes, a New Being will arise. The Secret is written in the Volume&mdash;&mdash;the
secret that shall raise these ashes into life.</p>

<p>"Come hither, youth! <i>His</i> face was like thine, the wierd sage who first
taught me the secret of Eternal Youth. His name was Vayomer Aloheim&mdash;wear
thou that name forever! When I am dying, gaze in my face and inhale
my last breath. My Soul shall pass into thine! Thou shalt be the
second Ravoni of the Faith; I give thee my soul, with the last word I e'er
shall speak!"</p>

<p>No more tears from the band of Disciples, no more groan of agony! All
was sudden and wild enthusiasm. "Hail, Ravoni," burst that thunder shout,
"Hail Ravoni, we worship thee!"</p>

<!-- page 459 -->

<p>"Vayomer Aloheim draw the knife from the wound, and let me die!"</p>

<p>There was a pause&mdash;a terrible pause. The red knife glittered in the air;
the blood gushed and poured streaming on the floor. They caught it on
their white mantles, on their faces and their hands! It was <i>sacred</i>, the
blood of their Founder, the blood of Ravoni.</p>

<p>He raised himself proudly to his full height; his dark eyes glared with
supernatural light; with folded arms he stood erect.</p>

<p>"Farewell my children, Izol&eacute; farewell!"</p>

<p>The words lingered on his lips, as he fell dead along the marble floor.</p>

<p>HO! From the mast-head a cry shrieks through the clouds of night.</p>

<p>"Land, there to the west&mdash;land!" Aye, land, after a long and stormy voyage,
land after bloodshed, mystery and gloom&mdash;&mdash;hurrah!</p>

<p>And now white doves, bearing green leaves in their beaks, glide through the
air, and fruits and flowers, all from the land, float on the surface of the deep.</p>

<p>The morning breaks from the east, in glory and in promise. Look how the
red beams glitter over the pinions of the doves, but&mdash;ha! What means this
Omen? Where doves, white and snowy, floated through the air, but a moment
ago, now are ravens, black and gloomy. They shriek a mournful death-note on
the ear&mdash;their beaks are filled with leaves, sad, wintry, withered leaves, spotted
with blood.</p>

<p>The fruits and flowers floating on the rippling bosom of the Ocean&mdash;where are
they now? Ha, ha! On every wave a grinning corse-head with a raven picking
its gory meal, from the livid brow!</p>

<p>Yet still that cry from the mast-head&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Land on the western horizon&mdash;land! Hurrah!"</p>

<p class="small">HOME ONCE MORE.</p>

</div>

<p>IT is the hour of Christmas Eve. One short hour's travel down the
wintry sky, and the sun will sink to rest. The sky is filled with floating
clouds, grey, drifting and scarf-like; along the west, towers one dark and
gloomy wall, with the red sunbeams, pouring over each fantastic buttress
and pinnacle.</p>

<p>It is cold, bitter cold. It is cold, bitter cold, and the hungry outcast
prowls along the sidewalk, while the sleigh-bells tinkle in the street. There
is a robe of snow on the ground; the old State House roof is white; the

<!-- page 462 -->

very trees, thrusting their bare arms on high, look like stalactites in some
colossal cavern. Each rugged limb and tiny branch is white with snow.</p>

<p>To-night will be eighteen hundred and forty two years since the shepherds
watched near Bethlehem; to-morrow is the anniversary of the Birth
of Christ the Lord. To-night the city puts on its face of smiles. The poor
man's hearth to-night will crackle and glow with mirth and plenty. The
rich will feast, the outcast will starve or steal, the sincere Christian, whose
thread-bare coat is pledge for his truth, will gather round God's altar, and
watch till midnight for the coming of the Lord.</p>

<p>To-night the city which William Penn built in hope and honor,&mdash;whose
root was planted deep in the soil of truth and peace, but whose fruits have
been poison and rottenness, Riot, Arson, Murder and Wrong,&mdash;will put on
its face of smiles, and drink and feast and dance and pray for six hours at
least! So God bless Christmas Eve!</p>

<p>"For twenty-four long hours, food has not passed these lips! For three
days and nights I have been the sport of one delusion after another! My
brain burns, my pulses are on fire! There is a mystery about this
whole matter, an awful mystery which must be solved ere the sun goes
down!"</p>

<p>Folding his arms across his chest, Byrnewood strode toward the parlor
window, and looked out upon the wintry sky. His father, pale, wild and
haggard, stood leaning against the mantel, while his mother seated on the
sofa, gazed steadily forward with a vacant eye. No word passed from her
lips, but with a half-audible moaning sound, she sate rocking backwards and
forwards, while her hands clasped tightly together, rested on her knee. Her
eyeballs where dry and hot; no tears gave tokens of the awful sorrow that
was consuming her soul.</p>

<p>The light of the declining sun, reflected from the snow which covered
the streets and house-tops, gave a wild glow to Byrnewood's face.</p>

<p>"Ha! Luke Harvey laid the whole atrocious plot bare to my eye! I
ransacked Monk-Hall this morning, explored each nook and cranny of that
infernal den, but still no tokens of Mary! Luke's suspicions, and my own
point to Lorrimer as the villain, but I must be sure, aye sure! Accursed
be the drug that destroyed my memory! Yet still every now and then
gleams of light break on me&mdash;I can remember scenes, which the tongue
grows palsied, to tell, which the heart grows cold to imagine!"</p>

<p>His dark eyes assumed an expression of deep and painful thought, while
the sunlight fell warmly over his wrinkled visage. Wrinkled? Aye
wrinkled and grown old, with the agony of three days and nights.</p>

<p>"Byrnewood," said the old man in a faint voice. "I shall go mad if
this suspense continues much longer! Two days of agony, three sleepless
nights&mdash;I can endure it no longer! God be merciful to me, but it is too
much for an old man to bear!"</p>

<!-- page 463 -->

<p>The sound of merry sleighbells tinkled in the street. Byrnewood's eye
flashed, and his lip quivered. A handsome sleigh drawn by two blood
horses, dashed by the window, and while the driver cracked his whip merrily,
a young man sate lounging against the buffalo robe, while his manly
cheeks glowed with excitement, and his rich brown hair, floated waving on
the wind.</p>

<p>"I have sought him all day!" exclaimed Byrnewood, "He has avoided
me! If he is guiltless he need not fear my presence; if he is guilty then
God have mercy on him! I will bring him to you father, yes, yes, he shall
kneel at your feet mother, he shall swear that he knows nothing of my
sister Mary!"</p>

<p>With these words, he rushed from the room, and from the house. Old
Mr. Arlington looked from the window, and saw his son, dashing along the
street in pursuit of a sleigh, while his uncovered hair fell wildly over his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"He?" echoed Mrs. Arlington, raising her head and speaking for the
first time in an hour. "What does Byrnewood mean, my dear?"</p>

<p>"I know not, I know not!" cried the old man, still looking from the
window. "Mary&mdash;Mary&mdash;" he murmured in a low whisper, as though
his tongue loved to linger on the music of that name.</p>

<p>The fire burnt cheerily in the grate; its warm glow reflected to the
burnished furniture, gave a look of comfort to the spacious parlor, and the
marks of wealth and luxury, were scattered all around, but what were these,
in comparison with the agony that was silently gnawing the hearts of the
merchant and his wife? What were all the wealth of counting-house, land
and rent-roll in comparison with a daughter's honor?</p>

<p>As the Merchant Arlington stood gazing out of the window, with a vacant
stare, a carriage drawn by two horses, whose harness betrayed the hackney
coach, drove up to the door, and the coachman, a gentleman with stout form
rendered excessively corpulent, by a small clothing store of overcoats, sprang
from the box, and let down the steps. A tall lady in deep black, with a
thick veil over her face, stepped from the carriage, and ascended the steps
of the Merchant's mansion.</p>

<p>While the old man was yet wondering who the strangers could be, the
parlor door was thrown open, and the form of the white haired Negro,
"Lewey Gran" appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Massa heah is a lady a-waitin' to see you bery 'tickler. De Lor' Moses!
It may be somefin' 'bout de chile Mary&mdash;God in hebben bress her&mdash;&mdash;who
knows?"</p>

<p>As Lewey spoke, the tall lady entered the room, and confronted Mr. Arlington.
From head to foot her form was veiled in deep black. Her cloak,
and scarf were all of the same sombre hue. Her face was covered by a
thick crape veil, but still the gleam of two dark eyes glanced through the
dense folds, and rested on Arlington's face.</p>

<!-- page 464 -->

<p>"Your name is Arlington," said the strange Lady in a low and whispering
voice, "Your daughter Mary&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Arlington rose from her seat at that word; the Merchant listened in
quivering suspense.</p>

<p>"Your daughter Mary," resumed the strange Lady with a business of
tone that indicated suppressed emotion, "Has been missing for three days&mdash;"</p>

<p>Not a word from the old man's lips, but his wife murmured "You bring
news of Mary&mdash;Heaven bless you!"</p>

<p>"I will bring your child to you again!" said the stranger in a deep-toned
voice.</p>

<p>"God bless you!" was all that passed the Mother's lips.</p>

<p>"She is alive?" muttered the Merchant, with a fierceness of tone that had
never marked his voice before&mdash;"She is well? Unharmed&mdash;&mdash;no mockery
Madam, if you please, because, d'ye see our hearts are dying, dying within
us! Hah! You start! Tell me is Mary living? Or do you come to raise
our hopes, and when we look for our own sweet child again, to lay a corpse
at our feet?"</p>

<p>"Have no fears for your daughter's life! I will bring your child to you
on one condition&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quick&mdash;name it!" gasped Arlington and his wife in the same breath.</p>

<p>"That you ask your daughter no questions concerning her absence from
home, until her mind is sufficiently calm to answer?"</p>

<p>"We promise&mdash;we agree to this condition!" exclaimed the Father and
Mother.</p>

<p>"Your daughter is without, in my carriage&mdash;" began the Lady, when her
words were suddenly interrupted. Arlington sprang to the parlor door, with
a sudden movement he opened it, "My child, my child!" he exclaimed, and
then started backward, with an unexpected surprise.</p>

<p>On the very threshold of that door, stood a maiden form, veiled from head
to foot in robes of deep black. Had it not been for the waving of her dress,
as the wind from the front door swept through the hall, you might have fancied
that a carved figure of ebony stood on that threshold.</p>

<p>"My home!" exclaimed a well-known voice, and the maiden advanced a
single step. "My home!" There was a quiet pathos in the tone, with which
this was said, that would have melted a heart of stone.</p>

<p>"<i>My home!</i>" she repeated again, in that same whispered tone.</p>

<p>"My child!" shrieked the Father and Mother, rushing toward her with
outspread arms.</p>

<p>The maiden started back, recoiling on the threshold.</p>

<p>"Stand back father, stand back mother!" she shrieked in a tone of heart-broken
despair. "Let me pass!" she cried, springing on her feet, and moving
hurriedly toward the back parlor. "I am all unworthy of your slightest
notice! I am a poor, fallen thing, father&mdash;&mdash;a stained and dishonored girl,
mother!"</p>

<!-- page 465 -->

<p>As though a bolt from heaven had splintered on his forehead, Arlington
started backward. With a faint cry Mrs. Arlington gazed in the face of her
daughter, and echoed her words "Dishonored, <i>dishonored!</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh mother," said Mary, raising her hands as if she wished to shrink from
her mother's very touch, "Three days ago, I crossed your threshold, like one
walking amid the scenes of a pleasant dream. Now the dream is over, and&mdash;&mdash;oh,
let me pass mother, let me hide my shame from your eyes of all
others! Let me pass, but do not touch the polluted thing who was once your
daughter!"</p>

<p>"Every word she utters is a dagger in my heart!" muttered the tall woman
in black, as with a hurried movement, she closed the folding doors which
divided the large parlor into two apartments. "Go in Mary; I'll be with
you presently!"</p>

<p>Slowly Mary advanced to the folding doors; her footsteps were clogged
and leaden. She advanced, she was about to enter the back parlor, when
she turned and beheld the statue-like forms of her parents. Her father, with
his grey hairs falling aside from a brow, on which agony like death was
writhing; her mother, with her pale face, stricken with a horror that palsied
every feature!</p>

<p>Mary spread her arms toward them with a wild shriek. "Father, mother,
bless your child! But no&mdash;&mdash;" and she sank back, recoiling from their
outspread arms&mdash;"I am forever fallen! Ah&mdash;it was a short and blessed
dream, followed by a terrible awakening! Here I was to return, at your
feet I was to kneel, and <i>he</i>&mdash;&mdash;oh Heaven&mdash;<i>he</i>, was to kneel by my side,
and crave your blessing! Now father, now my mother, it is Christmas Eve,
I return, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her head drooped on her bosom; low sobs choked her utterance; she
went slowly through the folding doors.</p>

<p>"Ha!" muttered the woman in black, approaching the window, "Byrnewood
and Lorrimer! The brother looks wild and pale, the Libertine wears
a free and careless look. But hold&mdash;I will yet atone for my crime! I will
force Lorrimer, to do this girl the small justice, of linking her name with
his, in marriage. As you wish to see the mystery unravelled," she exclaimed
 aloud turning to the merchant and his wife, "do not, I beseech
you, inform any one, not even Mary's brother, of her return home, until
the lapse of fifteen minutes. Do you promise me this?"</p>

<p>"We do," murmured the parents, in mechanical tones.</p>

<p>"They come, the Seducer and the Avenger!" muttered the woman in
black, and then she glided through the folding doors.</p>

<p>The merchant gazed silently in the face of his wife. Not a word was
uttered. The agony had come at last, stunning, darkening, and overwhelming.</p>

<p>"Better death than dishonor!" muttered the Merchant, after the lapse of
a painful pause. His blue eye was full of wild light.</p>

<!-- page 466 -->

<p>A loud and cheerful laugh resounded from the hall: "Ha, ha, my dear
boy, so ridiculous! It's hardly fair, 'pon honor hardly fair! To hurry a
fellow from a nice little party of young bloods, who are about to go a-sleighing,
all over town and country&mdash;it's <i>hardly</i> fair! And all this haste and
hurry that I may give the lie, to a ridiculous fancy that has taken possession
of your brain&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words were interrupted by the opening of the door. Byrnewood
Arlington and Gustavus Lorrimer, entered the parlor arm in arm. The wild
form and haggard face of Byrnewood, was in strong contrast with the easy,
devil-may-care appearance of the Libertine. His gold-headed cane to his
mustachioed lips, his brown hair, floating aside from his manly face in easy
curls, his dark eyes dancing in careless glee, he came lounging into the
parlor, and greeted the Merchant and his wife, with a deep and respectful
bow.</p>

<p>"Why Mr. Wilwood excuse me, is that your name? I never knew,
that either you or your sister, were in existence until you accosted me in the
State House yard, yesterday morning!"</p>

<p>"There stand my father and my mother!" said Byrnewood with suppressed
emotion. "My father has not a hope, that does not hang on his
daughter's life, my mother not a thought but for her peace and joy. Will
you swear in their presence, that you know nothing of the place, where my
sister is concealed?"</p>

<p>"More than that I will swear, that I never spoke to her in my life!"
And humming an air from the last opera, Lorrimer lounged toward the
window. "Pretty hard one that! But there's but one way to overcome
their suspicions! Let me, ha, ha, put brass on my face, and oil on my
tongue! I must <i>face</i> it out! That drug of Devil-Bug's had rather an
effect on our friend's intellect!"</p>

<p>"Father," cried Byrnewood, "this strange mystery grow darker and
deeper. The dream, in whose mazes, I have been wandering for days, becomes
more dread and horrible, every instant. This gentleman can solve the
mystery and awake me from the dream. Listen to the Oath which I now
dictate to him. If he utters a false word, may the curse of a father's grey
hairs, brought down to an untimely grave, rest upon him and blight him
forever!"</p>

<p>"My son," said the old man in a husky voice, "I will listen to the end
of this dark mystery."</p>

<p>"And I!" exclaimed the mother. "Heaven grant that the wronger of
our child, may meet with the reward of his crime!"</p>

<p>They formed a group in the centre of that parlor. Lorrimer stood in
the centre, with his back to the window; on either side, was the father
and mother, with light of the declining day falling upon their withered
faces.</p>

<!-- page 467 -->

<p>Byrnewood stood before him, his dark eye, flashing with a fixed and unalterable
glance; his cheek was like death; his lips white and ashy by turns.</p>

<p>"Do you swear by your hopes of salvation, that you know nothing of
Mary Arlington my sister, and that you never did her wrong?"</p>

<p>"I do!" said the firm and bold voice of Lorrimer.</p>

<p>"Your face is truthful, and your voice is firm! It must have been a
dream! Another test, Sir, and I have done. If you have uttered a falsehood,
do you invoke upon your head that scorn of man, that doom of Heaven
that ever awaits the <i>Perjurer!</i>"</p>

<p>He raised his hand on high, and looked fixedly in the face of Lorrimer.
For a moment, a slight fear darkened that handsome countenance, and then
the clear words, resounded through the room&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, the folding doors swung gently apart, and a maiden form
clad in deep black, glided slowly into the room. A sudden glow from the
declining sun lit up her face, as she advanced; her cheeks warmed with
deep emotion, her blue eyes gazed steadily in Lorrimer's face.</p>

<p>"My sister!" shrieked Byrnewood, starting with surprise mingled with
an awful fear. "My own sister Mary!"</p>

<p>It was all he could say. There was a death-like sensation at his heart;
a choking feeling in his throat. Calm and immoveable stood Gustavus
Lorrimer, the light from the folding doors, pouring warmly over his face.
For a moment, a slight quivering movement was perceptible on his mustachioed
lip, for a single instant, his brow was darkened by a convulsive
frown.</p>

<p>"Now swear you never wronged that girl!" shrieked Byrnewood in a
tone like madness.</p>

<p>Mary advanced; her arms were outspread, a glow of delight warmed
over her face.</p>

<p>"<i>Lorraine!</i>" she cried in a tremulous voice.</p>

<p>"There," exclaimed Lorrimer, with a cool smile. "What more proof
do you want? She does not even know my name!"</p>

<p>"<i>Lorraine!</i>" shrieked Mary, as with arms outspread, she glided towards
her lover. There was a sneering smile on his face; his arms were folded,
and he gazed upon the girl, with a half-shut eye.</p>

<p>Mary gave one long and intense look; the truth broke upon her, that She
was a disowned and dishonored thing. With a faint moan, as though a
falling rock had stricken her down, she fell to the floor, and lay insensible
at her Seducer's feet.</p>

<p>"If you have uttered a falsehood or sworn to a lie," shrieked Byrnewood
with a fierce and determined look, "Do you hope, that before sunset to-day,
you may die a sudden and bloody death?"</p>

<p>"I do!" exclaimed Lorrimer, disengaging his boot, from the arm of the
fainting girl, which had fallen over it. "I do!"</p>

<!-- page 468 -->

<p>"Then a sudden and bloody death you shall die!" arose the shriek of a
woman's voice. The folding doors were thrown open again. From the
windows of the back parlor, a stream of red sunlight, poured over the scene.
A tall woman, in dark robes, stood between Lorrimer and the light, her
hand upraised, and her dark eyes, darting a withering look upon his handsome
face. "Then a sudden and bloody death you shall die! For your
words are false as hell!"</p>

<p>Lorrimer recoiled a single step, and a deep curse breathed from his lips.
"Ha!"&mdash;Thus ran his thoughts&mdash;"Bess here? Death and confusion!
But I will brazen it out! Byrnewood's memory is confused; he remembers
nothing of the past!"</p>

<p>"Hear me, one and all," exclaimed Bess, as with her eye flashing and
her hand upraised, she looked like an inspired Prophetess. "This man
lured Mary Arlington from her home. Pure and innocent as she was, he
wronged her! Stainless as one of God's own angels, he dishonored her
form, and darkened her soul by a hideous crime! I, his instrument, his accomplice
accuse him, and fling his money to which the hire of Judas were
a hallowed thing, I fling the wages of my crime, at yon Perjurer's feet!"</p>

<p>"God of heaven!" shrieked the old man, tottering as though he had received
his death-wound. "What dark confession is this?"</p>

<p>"Our child <i>dishonored!</i>" echoed Mrs. Arlington.</p>

<p>"Further concealment is in vain!" cried Lorrimer with a cool supercilious
smile. "Your daughter was weak and foolish&mdash;I was but a&mdash;man!"</p>

<p>Byrnewood advanced, he laid his hand lightly on the Seducer's shoulder.
His face was frightfully calm.</p>

<p>"There are but two remedies for this wrong. I give you your choice.
Will you&mdash;&mdash;" his voice died in his throat for a moment, and a sound like
a death groan shook his chest, "Will you marry my sister?"</p>

<p>The old man's blue eyes shone with a fierce glance. For a moment he
smothered the hate which rose to his eyes and lips.</p>

<p>"Marry my daughter," he shrieked, "Save her from public shame!
Let an old man's grey hairs plead with you!"</p>

<p>No vision of Christmas Eve, the River and the Death, rose up to affright
the haughty pride of the Libertine. To be forced to marry the girl, whom
he had seduced&mdash;pah! He could hear the laugh of all his hollow-hearted
friends, he could see the look and the taunt and the gibe of scorn levelled
at his head.</p>

<p>"Why the fact is my friends, I'm not a marrying man," he said with
withering politeness, as he moved toward the door. "This affair is quite
unpleasant and&mdash;&mdash;your family and mine, are quite different in their style.
You are not of our 'set.' "</p>

<p>He said this, and rushed from the room. In a moment, ere the group in
the parlor, could recover from their astonishment, the merry jingle of his
sleigh-bells, broke upon their ears.</p>

<!-- page 469 -->

<p>"Now for the other remedy!" shrieked Byrnewood Arlington. "Nay
hold me not father&mdash;mother release my arm! I will neither eat, nor drink,
nor sleep until I have washed out my sister's wrong, in this man
blood!"</p>

<p>CHAPTER SECOND.</p>

<p class="small">THE PERSONAGE.</p>

</div>

<p>THE light of the declining sun, reflected from the snow on the house-tops,
poured warmly into the chamber of the Millionaire, in the fourth story of
the colossal TON HOUSE. Dim, the Creole boy stood before the mirror, with
his light form, clad in a neat suit of blue cloth, and a small cap placed
jauntily on his head.</p>

<p>"De High-Golly!" he exclaimed, slapping his nether limbs, as he addressed
his tutelar Deity. "Dat 'ill do! Dis chile look like a reg'lar buck!
Wonder whar de debbil, Massa is? Habn't seen him, since last night at
Camden. Hows'ever dere's no use o' frettin' 'bout <i>him</i>&mdash;hah-a-whah&mdash;de
debbil always takes care his own!"</p>

<p>Opening a drawer of the dressing bureau, the Creole drew from thence, a
box of Lucifer matches and a cigar.</p>

<p>"De young gemmen will take a smoke," said Dim, with quiet dignity as
he lit the cigar, and seating himself on one chair, placed his feet over the
back of another. "Dis Habanner am prime! Get out now! Who ses
dis chile ain't a gemmen born? 'Look leah yo' dam-niggar brack dem
boots, right off, and den or-dah coachee to bring out de carri'ge, or I'll
smash yo' jaw! Dat's de talk! Now de young gemmen will read this
news."</p>

<p>Taking a dingy yellow-grey newspaper, from a chair at his elbow, Dim
began to peruse its contents.</p>

<p>"Hello! 'De Daily Brack Mail.' 'Wonderful abduction case&mdash;Miss
Arlington missing!' Wonder whar de debbil de murders is? 'Shockin'
Calamity&mdash;Death of Albert Livingstone Esq., and his wife&mdash;burned alive&mdash;mansion
house of Hawkewood in Jersey.'&mdash;Dat's somefin' horrible&mdash;De
High Golly!"</p>

<p>This last ejaculation, was caused by the sudden opening of the chamber
door. A figure, enveloped in a blue cloak, spattered with dust and mud,
approached the side of the Creole boy. Dim gave a start, and from the
folds of the cloak, appeared a wan and haggard face, with stiff black hair
falling, in matted locks, around its care-worn outlines.</p>

<!-- page 470 -->

<p>"Massa!" cried Dim, springing from his seat.</p>

<p>"H-u-s-h, or I'll brain you!" muttered the hoarse voice of Fitz-Cowles.
"Hush&mdash;not a word, on the peril of your life. Tell me quick&mdash;has <i>he</i> come?"</p>

<p>The look and tone were significant.</p>

<p>"Yes Massa. He am in his room down sta'rs!"</p>

<p>Without a word, Fitz-Cowles drew the cloak over his haggard face, and
rushed from the chamber.</p>

<p>The light of an astral lamp, standing on a table littered with books and
papers, fell round a spacious chamber of the TON HOUSE, furnished in a
style of gorgeous splendor. Silken curtains along the northern window
shut out the light of the declining sun, a massive mirror glittered above the
mantel, pictures in showy frames adorned the walls.</p>

<p>Leaning against the mantel, was a man of wide chest and towering
stature, clad from head to foot in deep black. The light from the table, fell
over his bronzed face, throwing each determined feature, into bold and powerful
relief. His dark eyes, were deep sunken, beneath a thick eyebrow,
over which arose the massive outline of a towering forehead. There was a
gleam in those dark eyes, like the glance of an enraged vulture, vivid, flashing
and merciless. There was a world of thought written on the surface of
that ponderous brow, a fearful determination in that firm mouth with its
compressed lips, an iron will in the fixed outline of that bronzed cheek and
massive chin.</p>

<p>The upper part of this man's face, the forehead relieved by dark hair,
sprinkled with grey, the thick brows and the deep sunken eyes, was full of
intellect and soul; the lower part, the nose with quivering nostrils, the mouth
with the corners inclining slightly upwards, the massive cheek-bone and the
heavy chin, was full of the animal and sensual.</p>

<p>Altogether that bronzed face, was a remarkable combination of the soul
and the brute, high intellect that embraced the stars, and low cunning that
grovelled in the gutter.</p>

<p>The towering height of this PERSONAGE, gave his striking face a look of
commanding grandeur. As he stood there, leaning against the mantel, he
reminded you, of those stained names which blacken the page of history,
those corrupt Ministers, who ruled the luxurious kings of France, the stern
Visconti, who with steel and poison, held a malignant sway over the destinies
of Italy, or those tyrants of the ancient Rome, who endeavored to forget
their humble origin, in seas of blood and crime.</p>

<p>"Hah!" ejaculated the Personage, fixing his eyes upon a portrait which
hung opposite. " 'Man of thoughtful brow and chivalrous look' as your
worshippers style their idols, what avail, has been your mind and chivalry,
against my craft? Have you not risen in my path, at every point of my
ambition, and have I not dragged you down, from the high pinnacle of your
hopes? Ha, ha! Craft I say, <i>craft</i> was my silent and certain weapon!

<!-- page 471 -->

The mob, hah! Curses on them, eternal curses! Why must they worship
an idol like that? Have I not stooped to them, flattered them, cajoled them,
aye, until my gorge rose with loathing? By the God, that rules the fate of
nations, when I look over their crumbling fragment of a republic, I see rising
above its ruins, the Giant Image of a Empire and a King!"</p>

<p>His clenched hand was raised in the air, and his vulture eye shot rays of
fire. Tell me, was that the man to trust with POWER?</p>

<p>Then looking with a sneer into the face of the Portrait, he sate down
beside the table, and the light strongly shone over his massive brow, as he
glanced at the papers which littered the cloth. Here were Maps of states
and kingdoms, territories and provinces; here too, were piles of letters bearing
the signatures of various men, scattered all over the world; dollar worshipping
merchants, scheming politicians, mighty statesmen, Lords and Ministers
of Kingdoms. Here too was a letter, bearing the sign manual of a
Crowned Sovereign.</p>

<p>"There are some men who would give their lives, to know the <i>secrets</i>
which lie scattered over this table," said the Personage, with a grim smile,
as he drank from a foaming pitcher, which stood beside the lamp. It was a
stout old fellow, of a pitcher&mdash;that, and as it smoked and foamed, it could
not have contained cold water.</p>

<p>"Hah! That 'juice of the rye' is somewhat strong!" exclaimed he,
smacking his lips. "But I must be careful! Minds that have endured the
shocks of fate, without a murmur, have gone out forever, with the indulgence
of an appetite! Still that 'rye' is excellent!"</p>

<p>The door opened; there was a footstep; and the haggard form of Fitz-Cowles
advanced toward the table.</p>

<p>The Personage looked upon him with a glance of cool astonishment.
Twelve hours had worked a fearful change with the handsome millionaire.
His cheeks were sunken; his eyes rolled wildly in their sockets; his lips
were stained with blood, drawn from the skin by his compressed teeth.</p>

<p>"Well Sir," said the Personage, "what now?"</p>

<p>"Last night I was arrested for forgery" exclaimed Fitz-Cowles, "Forgery
on the House of Livingstone, Harvey &amp; Co., for the amount of <i>one hundred
thousand dollars</i>. I escaped from the police officers; for a night and a day
I have evaded their search&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are guilty?" said the Personage in a quiet tone.</p>

<p>Fitz-Cowles assented by a nod of his head.</p>

<p>"What have you done with the money?"</p>

<p>"It is safe in New York. I sent it on, yesterday morning, directed to a
fictitious name."</p>

<p>"Well sir, what is your business with me?" said the Personage, gazing
in Fitz-Cowles' face with half-closed eyes.</p>

<p>"The gaol, the cell, the lash all threaten me; you must save me!"</p>

<!-- page 472 -->

<p>"Pray sir," exclaimed the Personage, with a smile of withering politeness,
"May I know the nature of your claims, upon my assistance?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, <i>sir</i>," exclaimed Fitz-Cowles, returning his withering sneer,
"For ten years past, I have received large sums of money from your hands.
It was you that rescued me at New Orleans, when I was about to be tried
for that little scrape on the Gulf. Thrice you saved me from imminent danger,
and until last March, you paid me a regular pension of four thousand
dollars a year&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, sir?" interrupted the Personage in a dry and biting tone.</p>

<p>"On your past <i>favors</i>, I found my present <i>claims</i>!"</p>

<p>"<i>Juan Larode</i>, you grow insolent!" and the Personage rising with a calm
sneer on his lip, "There is the door! To the gaol, or to the devil as you
like, but you gain no aid from me. Go!"</p>

<p>"Juan Larode!" echoed Fitz-Cowles as his eyes gleamed deadly rage.
"Old man dare you insult me, with my mother's name?</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he cried, moving to the door, "I will go to gaol, I will be
heralded from north to south as a Forger, but it shall be under your name,
old man, as your son, as Juan&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He gave a clear and biting enunciation to the name of the Personage.</p>

<p>"Bastard of a Creole slave," muttered the Personage with his eyes flashing
incarnate scorn. "Dare you speak to me thus&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do not put yourself in a passion, father" said Fitz-Cowles, resuming
his seat with a hollow mocking laugh. "Here is the marriage certificate of
my mother, which you gave me four years ago!"</p>

<p>The Personage sate down, and gazed in the face of the Forger. Eye met
eye, sneer met sneer, scowl gloomed on scowl. At that moment the resemblance
between the two was fearful and striking.</p>

<p>But that deadly fire, gleaming from those vulture eyes, that thick vein
shooting up between the thick eyebrows&mdash;&mdash;Fitz-Cowles quailed before
that look and frown!</p>

<p>"A paltry <i>forgery!</i>" laughed the Personage. "Think you, Juan Larode,
that had that certificate been genuine, I would have ever let it pass into your
hands? When I employed you as a spy, yes, scowl as you will, as a <i>spy</i>, a
<i>pimp</i> and <i>spy</i>, I wished to bind you to me, by the substantial link of legitimate
relationship. I gave you that forged certificate in order that you might
think yourself my <i>lawful</i> son. I knew that would not betray your <i>father</i>,
ha, ha, ha," and he laughed loud and long, "Your <i>father!</i>"</p>

<p>Fitz-Cowles grew white in the face. The hollow laugh of the man with
the massive forehead, and vulture eye, smote his ears like a death-knell.</p>

<p>"Bastard!" he muttered the foul word, and buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>The Personage sate looking upon him with a look of scorn.</p>

<p>"In the gaol, he will trouble me no more!" he muttered. "In gaol <i>for life!</i>"</p>

<p>Fitz-Cowles raised his brow from his hands. There was an expression of
utter desolation in every line of his face.</p>

<!-- page 473 -->

<p>"Sir, I will go, and to my doom," he said, in a subdued tone. "But ere
I go, you will allow me to ask you one trifling question. Do you remember
that package, enveloped in yellow paper, and sealed with three black seals?"</p>

<p>The tone of Fitz-Cowles was mild and subdued, but there was a devil's
light in his eye. The face of the Personage changed color; brow and cheek
became lividly pale.</p>

<p>"What know you of that package?" he said in a careless tone. "You
never saw it but once, and then, only the seals and the envelope?"</p>

<p>"Good evening <i>father</i>," said Fitz-Cowles, rising with a pleasant smile.
"I'll never trouble you more!"</p>

<p>The Personage rose suddenly, he dragged a massive trunk from under the
table, unlocked it, and opening a secret lid, drew from thence a massive
package, enveloped in yellow paper and sealed with three black seals.</p>

<p>"Hah! It is safe!" he muttered, while Fitz-Cowles stood smiling beside
the door.</p>

<p>"<i>Safe</i>, ha, ha, ha!" laughed the forger. That sneering laugh was full
of meaning.</p>

<p>With a sudden movement, the Personage broke upon the package, seal
after seal cracked between his fingers; he unrolled the envelope and discovered,
<i>a mass of blank paper, folded in the shape of letters!</i></p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! I thought the day might come when that package would
prove serviceable&mdash;'false keys' and 'false seals'&mdash;ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>The Personage bent his head slowly down to the table; his eyes sunken
yet deeper in their sockets glared with fearful intensity.</p>

<p>"Each of those letters is worth a thousand lives! My name, my honor,
will be eternally blasted by the revelation of a single letter! And then my
friends, my associates&mdash;all&mdash;" he clenched his hands fixedly together, and
was silent for a moment. "Come here, Juan Larode," he said in a
calm and even voice.</p>

<p>With a fearless step Fitz-Cowles approached the table. Inclining his
head slightly to one shoulder, the Personage gazed upon him with a sidelong
glance. His fingers quivered tremulously, and his face wore a smile,
that but faintly disguised the emotion, which branched from his heart through
every vein.</p>

<p>"You have those papers?" he said in a quiet tone.</p>

<p>"I have!" answered Fitz-Cowles. "You know <i>father</i> it wouldn't be
at all handsome, for you to see those documents published in the papers
some bright morning as 'wonderful disclosures'&mdash;ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>That laugh died away into a groan! With one vigorous movement of
his stalwart arm, the Personage gathered Fitz-Cowles within his grasp, and
without rising from his seat, he dragged the Forger to his knees.</p>

<p>"Now," he shouted as his muscular fingers encircled the throat of the
bravo. "Now, craven you must, yield those papers or die!" With a look
of cool determination, he tightened his grasp, until Fitz-Cowles grew purple

<!-- page 474 -->

in the face. Slowly his eyes began to start from their sockets. The Illegitimate
lay helpless in the grasp of his father; struggling, quivering, gasping
for breath.</p>

<p>"The papers&mdash;&mdash;" moaned Fitz-Cowles&mdash;"I gave them to a friend&mdash;to
keep for me. In case I am <i>imprisoned</i> or&mdash;or&mdash;<i>murdered</i>, this friend will
despatch those letters to a <i>friend</i> of yours, ha, ha, ha! Already they are
enveloped and directed to <i>his</i> address&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a choking laugh he pointed to the Portrait, which hung on the wall
opposite the mantel.</p>

<p>As though a palsy had stricken, his arm, the Personage let go his grasp.</p>

<p>"Get up Juan Larode," he said in a calm voice. "You shall not go
to gaol. Something must be done for you!"</p>

<p>In less than a month Fitz-Cowles walked the streets a free man. The
mysteries of the forgery, the hooks and crooks, by which that pliable old
gentleman THE LAW was evaded and conciliated, are they not written in the
Chronicles of the Criminal Courts?</p>

<p>Who was the individual, so mysteriously denominated the Personage?
The documents from which this history are drawn, are dark on that point,
but the reader may rest assured that <i>the Personage</i>, was either a Canadian
Statesman, or a British Lord, or a <i>Mexican Prince!</i></p>

<p>CHAPTER THIRD.</p>

<p class="small">MONK-HALL ONCE MORE.</p>

</div>

<p>"WHAT the devil yo' skeered about niggers?" growled Devil-Bug turning
hastily to his attendants. "Ain't I in my own home agin, ain't I in
Monk-Hall?"</p>

<p>"But Massa, de poleese is at de door"&mdash;muttered Musquito.</p>

<p>"And Massa de neighborhood is riz on us"&mdash;exclaimed Glow-worm.

The sound of a loud shout mingled with yells and groans, came thundering
through the front door. Then came a sound of violent knocking, followed
by a heavy crashing noise, as though stout arms were breaking the
panels of the door, with billets of massive timber.</p>

<p>"Come niggers," said Devil-Bug, "foller me!"</p>

<p>Taking each of them a lamp in his hand, from the table in the centre of the
Doorkeeper's room, they followed Devil-Bug who silently led the way down
stairs; he paused for a moment to look into the Banquet-Room. The glare of the
lamps flashed upon the form of the Skeleton Monk, standing at the head of the

<!-- page 475 -->

table, scattered over with goblets and wine-glasses, the relics of the last
feast of the Monks of Monk-Hall.</p>

<p>An expression of strange meaning came over Devil-Bug's face, as he
looked around the ancient room, but not a word passed his lips. His solitary
eye was unusually bright, and his wide lips placed fixedly together.
Slowly and silently, he led the way down into the Dead-Vault of Monk-Hall.</p>

<p>"These old pillars is all the friends I ever had!" muttered Devil-Bug
looking into the faces of the negroes, with a strange stare. "These old
walls, and these pillars, and these ceilin's and these floors, has always been
friends to me!"</p>

<p>The negro Glow-worm looked into Musquito's face with a vacant stare.
There was something in the manner of their master, that excited their
wonder.</p>

<p>"Look here Niggers," exclaimed Devil-Bug, "There's no use o' leavin
the corpse o' that Jew, above ground, and so I b'lieve we'll go and bury
him,&mdash;hello!" he exclaimed, as his eye rested upon a massive piece of rock
placed against one of the brick pillars. "I wonders <i>how that</i> 'ud vork?"</p>

<p>"What de debbil massa mean," asked Glow-worm.</p>

<p>"You see that rock's about three feet square," answered Devil-Bug. "It
must a-been a piece o' th' foundation o' Monk-Hall! D'ye see yo' d&mdash;n
niggars wot I mean? S'pose you shove that rock to that trap door, and
tumble it down into the pit o' Monk-Hall&mdash;don't yo' think that Jew's corpse
'ud be considerably smashed? Won't it be a sight easier than buryin' him?"</p>

<p>The negroes grinned hideously at each other, and a loud African guffaw
resounded through the dead vault.</p>

<p>"Hah&mdash;a-whah! Wot a dam idea-r!"</p>

<p>The sound of yells and shouts, mingled with the crashing of the front
door panels, came thundering down the staircase, and echoed through the
vault.</p>

<p>"Look here niggers, that feller's body must be hid afore the poleese
comes. I'll go down into the Pit and fix it right under the trap, and when
I give the word, do you, let the rock fall! D'ye hear niggers?"</p>

<p>"Yes massa!" chorused the Insects in a breath. Devil-Bug seized one
of the lamps, and strode rapidly from the dead-vault, while the negroes bent
their huge forms to the difficult task.</p>

<p>The light flashed over the arch of the deep stairway, as Devil-Bug, went
rapidly down into its depths.</p>

<p>"Queer," he muttered, "Cursed queer! I don't see <i>nay</i>ther of 'em&mdash;the
man with the broken jaw, the woman with the holler skull! Ha!
Here's the old Pit agin, with its graveyard smell, its big pillars o' brick
an' its beams of oak! Here I used to tumble about when I was a little bit
of an ugly devil, here I've seen many sights that 'ud freeze most people's
blood, and here&mdash;ho&mdash;hoo!"</p>

<p>Over crumbling piles of boards, over heaps of broken furniture, Devil-Bug

<!-- page 476 -->

went tramping through the gloomy cavern, while the rats started from
their nooks, and the reptiles, twining round the stout oaken beams, glistened
brightly in the lamp-beams, rendered dim and flickering by the foul air of
the place.</p>

<p>"I must be near the centre o' th' Pit"&mdash;exclaimed Devil-Bug, when a
start quivered through his frame, and a laugh, half surprise, half fear
shrieked from his lips, as a whizzing sound, echoed through the air, and a
herd of rats, disturbed from their loathsome meal, darted away from the light.
In the full glare of the lamp, lay the mangled remains of a human body,
clothing, flesh and features, crushed into one undistinguishable mass of corruption
and blood.</p>

<p>"Ha! Gabr'el Von Gelt you lay quiet enough, quiet as a&mdash;<i>lamb!</i>"
chuckled Devil-Bug, gazing toward the roof of the vault, far above. "Ho,
hoo! The crittur fell right below the trap-door, down plumb as a stone!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, there flashed the glare of a light, from the roof of the vault;
it quivered through the air, and resting on Devil-Bug's matted hair, formed
a long and bright column in the midst of darkness.</p>

<p>Devil-Bug spurned the body of the Jew aside, and placed the lamp on a
stone, not more than two feet from the spot where he stood. The air of
the vault was foul and stifling, and the lamp flickered with a faint and tremulous
light. Then folding his arms, with that column of light, from the distant
roof, pouring on his head, Devil-Bug stood silent and erect. His tangled
hair fell waving round his face, while his compressed lips and glaring
eye, indicated a deep and settled resolve. The rumbling of the rock, along
the floor above, came heavily to his ear.</p>

<p>"Ha! The g-a-l shall roll in wealth, dress in silks an' satins, and be a
lady all her life, old Devil-Bug's daughter, with the mark o' the red snake
on her right temple! It's all settled&mdash;Parson Pyne thinks she's the <i>first</i>
child o' Nell, tho' he told me she was the <i>second</i>. He said so afore Luke
to-day&mdash;ho, hoo! Old Devil-Bug's daughter among the grandees o' th'
Quaker City!"</p>

<p>Again that rumbling sound, from the roof far overhead, broke on his
ear. The rock drew nearer to the chasm, and Devil-bug chuckled grimly
to himself.</p>

<p>"Hello! Niggers are yo' ready?" he shouted, at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, Massa," the answer came faintly to his ear.</p>

<p>"Let it drop!" shrieked Devil-Bug. There was a pause.</p>

<p>The light shone over his face; it was agitated by a frightful smile.</p>

<p>"Good bye Nell," he said, and smiled.</p>

<p>Then a sound like a mighty building, falling to the ground, shook the
cavern, it was but for an instant! There was a heavy crash, and all was
darkness, save that dim column of light, streaming from the distant trap
door. A single beam struggled down through the darkness, and rested

<!-- page 477 -->

upon the rough surface of the massive rock, as it lay, sunken deep in the
cavern earth.</p>

<p>"Hello, Massa!" came the voice of Musquito from the trap-door, "Did
dat ar' smash de Jew?"</p>

<p>Not a word, not even a word in reply. Ha, ha, Devil-Bug was lying
dormant behind some massive pillar, without a doubt, chuckling as he
thought of the Jew's corpse, buried beneath the rock! He was such a jolly
old boy, was Devil-Bug!</p>

<p>All at once, like the yell of fire in the dead of night, on board a ship
at sea, a wild and thundering noise, echoed from the stairway, leading
down into the Pit. In a moment the cellar was filled by people, brandishing
torches and clubs in their upraised hands.</p>

<p>"Hurray, hurray! We've trapped the murderer!" they shouted, rushing
in various directions, through the wide cavern.</p>

<p>"Here he is, hidin' behind the stone!" cried a well-known voice, and
Easy Larkspur, holding a light in one hand and a pistol in the other, advanced
toward a massive rock, which uprose from the cavern earth.</p>

<p>"Here he is hidin' behind this rock," he cried as his face warmed with
excitement, resembled the full moon in a crimson mist. "Come out o' that
Mister or I'll shoot&mdash;come out I say!"</p>

<p>There was no answer! Devil-Bug was lying, quiet and snug, behind the
rock, waiting to spring on his antagonists.</p>

<p>"Fellers stand by me," said Larkspur, looking round into the faces of
some dozen 'Deppities o' th' Honorable Ma'or'&mdash;"I'll jist lean over the
rock, and take a peep at the varmint&mdash;"</p>

<p>Laying his ponderous weight on the rock, the light extended in one hand,
the pistol in the other, Larkspur leaned gently over the opposite side
and looked down. For a single moment, he remained in this attitude, and
then rose on his feet again, and looked into the visages of the officers. His
face so lately burning red, was now the color of yellow clay. The cold
sweat trickled down his features; his bulging eyes were full of fright and
horror.</p>

<p>"By G&mdash;d!" he cried in a tone that filled his comrades with horror, it
was so different from his usual voice, "I don't want to see a sight like that
<i>twice</i> in a life-time! A body smashed beneath a big rock, an' a head stickin'
out, with a face all purple, and the eye laid on the cheek, and tongue lollin'
from the mouth! Ugh! Gen'elmen," he continued in a husky whisper&mdash;"Our
pris'ner's escaped, an' that's a fact!"</p>

<p>CHAPTER FOURTH.</p>

<p class="small">THE MEETING OF THE BROTHER AND THE LIBERTINE.</p>

</div>

<p>AROUND the blazing stove in the Oyster Cellar, were gathered a band of
some twenty loungers, smoking and swearing in a breath, while Smoky
Chiffin, the lord of the cavern, stood behind the bar, dealing out hot whiskey
punch and other fragrant liquids, to a numerous band of customers.</p>

<p>"It's sleighin' time gents," cried Smoky, bustling to and fro, "Hot
Whiskey Punch don't go bad. What say? Brandy? Brandy for this
gemmen, John. What have for supper Sir? Venison, steak? Woodcock?
Sherry wine, Sir? Bottle o' Porter, John! Fine time gents glorious
sleighin'! Never knew better!"</p>

<p>The cavern was all clatter, jingle, heat and smoke. Smoky Chiffin was
in glorious spirits! Whether he looked at the conventual stalls, in the background,
crowded with hungry citizens, or the oyster box, lined with shellfish
devotees, or the liquor bar thronged with thirsty worshippers of that
jolly old Giant of a Decanter, the prospect was alike refreshing to his pocket
and spirits.</p>

<p>Two little men, were walking up and down, the marble floor of the cellar,
performing an easy promenade from the looking glass to the hot stove.</p>

<p>"You see Buzby, there's a deuce of a fuss made about it," said one of
the little men, arranging a jaunty glazed cap, on his head. "I might give
you something for your paper, I <i>might</i> I say"&mdash;And he applied a small
wiry cane, that looked like a piece of grape-vine in a consumption, to his
thin lips, and looked at Poodle with those Dresden wax-doll eyes.</p>

<p>"It would make a capital article, Silly, 'Full particulars of the abduction
case, by one of the friends of both families'&mdash;<i>allez avec un furie</i>, as we
say in Domestic French! It would go with a rush! Come, Silly, give me
all the 'rich licks' for the next Black Mail?"</p>

<p>"I might," responded Silly, "But d'ye see Poodle, you rather cut up
my Hem. in the Mail this morning. Just think of it&mdash;two plates, one the
death of Cock Robin, t'other a nigger church on fire, and all for the shockingly
cheap rate of two dollars a-year, office, 209, Drayman's alley, up
stairs&mdash;&mdash;oh Poodle <i>that</i> was hardly fair!"</p>

<p>"Cut up your Hem.?" echoed Poodle, admiring the shape of his unique
leg, "Why just give me, the particulars of this abduction case, an' I'll give
you a puff of a column-and-half! I'll swear that you're the tallest author
we have, that your contributors are all too smart for their trowsers, that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you do it up brown?" remarked Petriken quoting from the classics.</p>

<p>"Will I?" cried Poodle, arranging his wig. "Won't I? I'll refute all
those cursed lies, which your enemies, have put in circulation, about you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Genius</i> has its enemies," meekly remarked Petriken, tapping his boot

<!-- page 479 -->

with his ghost of a cane. "I can't expect to be exempted from the lot of
Byron, Shelly and Shufflebottom. You know Shufflebottom, don't you?
He's one of my first contributors."</p>

<p>"I'll refute their cursed lies! They say you're fed and clothed by sich-and-sich
a publisher, who pays you for doing his dirty work; that you never
write, except with a copy of Byron, Bulwer, James, and a scissors a-fore you,
that you creep into the good graces of all the literary men of any repute in
the country, in order to befoul them with your lies and slander&mdash;&mdash;they
say all this, but I'll refute it, that I will, Silly!"</p>

<p>"Then they said, that one of my best female contributors, went to bed
every night with a junk bottle of whiskey under her pillow&mdash;&mdash;will you
refute that?"</p>

<p>Ere Poodle could reply, the stout form of Easy Larkspur, arrayed in a
grey overcoat, stepped between him and the little Magazine man.</p>

<p>He fixed his eye on the Editor of the Black Mail, with a look of supreme
scorn.</p>

<p>"Is you the squirt wot edits the Black Mail?" he asked in a tone of
quiet wonder. "Is you that little crooked-leg, snub-nosed squirt, wot they
calls Poodle?"</p>

<p>These words were far from being complimentary. Poodle grew red in
the face, and then pale as his shirt bosom. There was a dangerous look
in Larkspur's bulging eyes. Poodle squinted over his shoulder, to the cellar
stairs and to the door.</p>

<p>"Is you the werry contemptible squirt as made fun of my personal
a'pe'rence, in your paper t'other day?" growled Larkspur, shaking his fist
under Buzby's nose.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;it wasn't me&mdash;it was somebody else"&mdash;stammered the little Editor.</p>

<p>"It wos, wos it? You small pattern of a man, you remnant of creation,
you"&mdash;Larkspur grew red in the face with rage&mdash;"You <i>Poo</i>-dle!"</p>

<p>"Sir&mdash;indeed, you're mistaken in the person"&mdash;faltered Buzby.</p>

<p>"There's no use o' lyin'! You've got to be licked, an' I've got to do it!"</p>

<p>With these words, he coolly tweaked the unresisting Poodle by the nose,
and boxed his ears with the palm of his hand. The little Editor, started
toward the door, but Larkspur caught him by the wig, and as Poodle wriggled
from his grasp, he held the trophy in his hand.</p>

<p>"Why consarn my buttons, the feller wears a wig!" cried Larkspur in
deep astonishment, as he flung the mass of curly hair on the floor, where it
lay, with the inside exposed to the light, like a spittoon or a dish.</p>

<p>A roar of laughter shook the cellar. Smokey Chiffin underwent a violent
convulsion, and the gentlemen around the blazing stove indulged in a loud
guffaw. Poodle stood in the centre of the floor, his <i>naked</i> head, but scantily
clothed with sparsely settled hair, stiff and uncouth as a shoe brush, while
Larkspur stood opposite, expectorating tobacco juice into the crown of the
curly wig.</p>

<!-- page 480 -->

<p>There my feller, make fun o' my personal a'pe'rence agin,"
Larkspur, adding a handfull of pea-nut shells to the tobacco juice. "Feller
take up yer head o' hair an' travel!"</p>

<p>His eye was fixed upon the Editor's face. Poodle stooped to the floor
seized the wig, placed his hat under his arm, and made for the door.</p>

<p>"By Jove," he snivelled, as he crushed the wig, tobacco juice, pea-nut
shells and all, down upon his cranium, "This isn't the fair thing, if it is,
damme!"</p>

<p>"Come my feller give us the Domestic French for <i>that!</i>" exclaimed
Easy Larkspur, "Put it down in the Black Mail, under the head of 'Atrocious
outrage on the Liberty of the Press! An Editor's wig pulled off, and
filled with tobacco juice an' ground-nut shells!' "</p>

<p>These last words escaped Poodle's ear. With Editorial celerity he had
vanished from the cellar.</p>

<p>Petriken stood gazing round the place, in vague wonder, listening with
evident chagrin, to the hoarse laughter of the by-standers, as they made
merriment out of Poodle's disgraceful Hegira.</p>

<p>There was the sound of a hurried footstep, Petriken felt a hand laid on his
shoulder, and Gus Lorrimer stood by his side.</p>

<p>"The devil's to pay, my boy," he exclaimed in a quick and hurried
whisper, "the very devil's to pay, about this girl. The family will raise the
whole town on me. The Father and mother, and I don't know how many
couzins, suspect me, and will doubtless take steps to give me, considerable
annoyance. Silly we must leave town until the storm blows over&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leave town?" echoed Silly, who had grown suddenly pale in the face.
"I say Gus you mustn't drop a word about my playing parson. Where
will we go? Raising the devil are they? What a pity you didn't let the
girl alone?"</p>

<p>"Let the girl alone?" cried Lorrimer, while his eyes shone and his cheek
glowed. "Pshaw! The girl was pretty, loveable! Her eye was a melting
blue, her lip a delicious ruby&mdash;I like pretty and loveable girls, with
blue eyes and ruby lips. Mary Arlington pleased my fancy; I wooed and
won her. Now for the consequences! We must leave town till the storm
is over. Come Silly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned toward the door, with a laugh on his lips, but that laugh, in
an instant was changed into a muttered curse.</p>

<p>The Brother of Mary Arlington, stood between the Libertine and the door,
his uncovered forehead pale as ashes, corrugated in a fixed frown, while his
dark eyes, sunken deep beneath the brows, emitted a wild and deadly light.
While his cloak fell back from his shoulder, he raised his white hand slowly
in the air.</p>

<p>"Here in this cellar, three nights ago, you boasted of the Seduction of
my sister," he said in a calm and deliberate voice, "You filled my ears
with your atrocious plot; I sat listening to the story of my sister's shame,

<!-- page 481 -->

while the wine cup was in my hand, the light laugh on my lip! Here in
this vile retreat of the vilest dissipation, you must give me satisfaction for
the wrong you have put upon me, and mine! Here my sister's honor shall
be avenged, and in your blood will I wash out her shame!"</p>

<p>His tones were fearfully calm. While the loungers started up in wonder,
and Petriken slunk into a dark corner, Lorrimer stood in the centre of the
cellar, gazing over Byrnewood's shoulder, upon the large mirror, which
adorned one end of the Saloon.</p>

<p>"You must fight me," said Byrnewood, as he presented two pistols to the
silent Libertine. "Take your choice of weapons!"</p>

<p>"Fight you," echoed Lorrimer, in an absent tone, as he stood gazing over
the Brother's shoulder into the mirror. "Ha, ha, ha," he laughed turning
suddenly to the Keeper of the Saloon, who was leaning over the bar, "I
say Chiffin, why d'ye have such pictures in your cellar? D&mdash;&mdash;n it man,
do you mean to frighten <i>me</i>, by such cursed nonsense? Look there I say,
look there! Who painted that broad river, with its waves turned to blood,
by the last rays of the setting sun? And my head sinking between the
waters, with that hand clenching my throat and that foot trampling me down
to a shameful death&mdash;who has dared to paint that mockery there?"</p>

<p>With his outstretched hand, he pointed to the mirror, he turned his livid
face from side to side, while his lip writhed and his hazel eye rolled with a
maniac wildness. The hallucination was upon him in all its horror. Christmas
Eve, the River and the Death, rushed on his soul in hues of doom and blood.</p>

<p>"You must answer for your crime on this spot," shouted Byrnewood,
advancing to the Libertine. "Hah! <i>Coward</i> are you silent? Do you think
to scare me from my purpose, with this silly mummery? Will no words, no
scorn, rouse you to something like manhood? Then take the insult of a blow!"</p>

<p>With his clenched hand he struck Lorrimer on the chest, and then seized
him by the throat.</p>

<p>The Libertine gazed at him with a vacant stare, as he coolly unwound the
grasp of those writhing fingers.</p>

<p>"Fool," he cried, pointing to the mirror. "Look, my face in yon picture
changes to yours! It is my hand that clenches your throat, it is my foot,
that tramples you beneath the waters! Fight you," he continued suddenly,
as the livid hues of his countenance, were succeeded by a healthy glow,
"Pshaw man! Have I not wronged the Sister, why should I murder the
Brother?"</p>

<p>With a half-mocking smile he pushed Byrnewood from his path, and rushed
up the cellar steps. The Brother stood like a man in a dream, gazing around
the crowd of wondering faces that looked upon him on every side, while the
clear ringing sound of sleigh-bells in motion, came echoing down the cellar
stairs. That sound roused him from his sudden stupor. He buried the pistols
in his bosom, he rushed from the cellar.</p>

<p>He was in the street, but he knew it not. The cold wind broke over his

<!-- page 482 -->

uncovered brow, the beams of the setting sun glistened among the ringlets
of his waving hair; he did not behold the sun, he did not feel the bitter wind.
All was darkness and heat, within and without! Darkness, while Chestnut
Street was alive with the prancing of gallant steeds, the gliding of sleighs,
the merry jingle of bells! Heat, while the winter sun shone over the State
House roof, and the wide streets all white with snow, heat, that burned his
brain and turned his eyes to flame!</p>

<p>All was darkness, yet his eye beheld that distant sleigh, drawn by two
gallant steeds. Byrnewood had a vague consciousness of eyes fixed upon
him, of houses rushing by him, yet still his eye was fixed upon that sleigh,
upon that form, partly seen above its panels, upon the ruddy face, turned
over the shoulder, with locks of rich brown hair, tossed wildly on the wind.
This face, this form he saw, but nothing more. The face every moment,
grew more distant, yet every moment, to him, the frenzied Brother, each
line and feature was more plain and distinguishable.</p>

<p>He rushed down Chestnut Street, with his arms outspread, his hair flying
on the wind, his dark eyes flashing on the distance. The crowd gave way
before his footsteps. Plumed belle, and soft-visaged exquisite, sober merchant,
and prattling child walking by its mother's side on that pavement of
beauty and fashion, started aside at his approach.</p>

<p>"It was a madman!" the shout rung from lip to lip.</p>

<p>He passed the marble columns of the massive Bank, where the hopes of
thousands lie entombed, he passed a long array of glittering stores, and then
his path was thronged by a crowd of ragged boys, who made the air ring
with shouts and cries.</p>

<p>They held papers under their arms and in their hands, shouting their contents
in loud and boisterous tones. For a single moment, Byrnewood listened.
"The seduction of Mary Arlington with a portr-a-i-t! Daily Black Mail&mdash;only
one cent!"</p>

<p>The shame of his sister, paraded in the columns of a leprous sheet, the
mouth-piece of the Ruffian and the Courtezan, a thing so vile, that to mention
its name in a decent presence is an insult and a disgrace! The thought
was fire to Byrnewood's veins.</p>

<p>He dashed onward, he turned the corner of Third Street, his eye still fixed
upon the sleigh, in a moment he stood in front of the Girard Bank, when his
career was suddenly terminated. He felt his hand pressed in a manly grasp,
and a friendly voice rung in his ears.</p>

<p>"My God, Byrnewood, what does this mean?" cried the hearty tones of
Luke Harvey, "why are you rushing like a madman along the street?"</p>

<p>"The Seducer of my sister, <i>he</i> must die," gasped Byrnewood.</p>

<p>"Ha!" muttered Luke, "His sister's wrong has disturbed his reason, I
must lure him from the city, or he will commit some desperate deed. Come
Byrnewood," he added aloud, "You shall have revenge! A word in your ear.
Lorrimer takes the cars for Baltimore this afternoon. We will follow him."</p>

<p>"We will!" shrieked Byrnewood, "To the Death!"</p>

<p>CHAPTER FIFTH.</p>

<p class="small">SUNSET ON CHRISTMAS EVE.</p>

</div>

<p>THE warm glow of the setting sun, gleaming through an opening in the
clouds, streamed down the hill of Walnut Street, over the wharf, and along
the broad bosom of the Delaware.</p>

<p>Some few idlers were lounging round the doors of the hotel; here and
there stood a vagrant, along the edges of the wharf, gazing indolently at the
form of the retreating ferry boat, which some hundred yards from shore,
was ploughing its way, through the waters of the Delaware, toward the dim
shores of Jersey.</p>

<p>Suddenly the sun disappeared behind a cloud, and two figures came
hastening down Walnut Street, rushing hurriedly through the snow, toward
the wharf. In a few moments they attained the edge of the wharf, they
stood upon the ferry landing, and gazed upon the retreating steamboat,
while an expression of deep chagrin spread over their faces.</p>

<p>"Curse the thing," cried the tallest of the twain, whose manly form, was
enveloped in a tight-fitting white overcoat, "We are too late for the boat!"</p>

<p>With an oath on his lips, he then gazed nervously along Walnut Street,
and paced the wharf, with a wild and hurried footstep.</p>

<p>His companion, a little man, wrapped up in a large cloak, with a well-polished
glazed cap on his head, also cast an eager look along Walnut
Street, and then gazed at the retreating ferry boat, with a deep muttered
curse.</p>

<p>"Gus, we're too late for the boat," he exclaimed in a hurried whisper.
"Hadn't we better go up home again? I don't exactly like the idea of
standing here in this public place&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will leave this town to-night!" exclaimed Lorrimer, "Aye, leave the
Quaker City, if I have to swim to yonder shore! Tell me, good fellow, is
there no way of crossing to Camden?"</p>

<p>He spoke to a weather-beaten man, whose broad shoulders, and brawny
chest were enveloped in a stout pea-jacket, while an old tarpaulin hat,
shadowed over his sunburnt brow.</p>

<p>"That's the last ferry boat Mister," said the fisherman, "But I've got a
boat layin' alongside the wharf, there, that would take you over in a jiffey."</p>

<p>"Quick&mdash;there's a dollar for you," cried Lorrimer in hurried tones,
"Row us over in time for the New York cars, and I'll make it five!"</p>

<p>Ere a moment passed, Petriken and the fisherman, were seated in the boat,
while Lorrimer lingered on the edge of the wharf.</p>

<p>For a single instant he stood with his handsome form raised to its full
height, while the wind played with the curls of his dark brown hair. His

<!-- page 484 -->

hazel eye, gleamed with light, while his mustachioed lip, was compressed
with some deep emotion.</p>

<p>"Christmas Eve!" he muttered, "Farewell to the Quaker City, and farewell
for many a day!"</p>

<p>He leaped into the boat, and seated himself, by Petriken's side, in the
seat nearest the bow.</p>

<p>"Trim boat," cried the Fisherman, as he sat in the central seat, with an
oar grasped in each sturdy hand, "Trim boat, an' I'll make the crittur fly!"</p>

<p>He was about, to urge the boat into the stream, when his attention was
arrested by a voice from the wharf. Two persons stood soliciting a passage
to the opposite shore. One was a tall Quaker, whose broad-brimmed hat
shadowed a fine venerable face, while his ruddy cheeks contrasted with his
snow white hair, presented the tokens of a green old age. He was dressed
in dark brown attire, shapen after the peculiar fashion of his sect, a capacious
great coat, reaching to his heels, thrown open in front revealing the
under coat, and voluminous waistcoat, all of the same respectable hue.</p>

<p>"Friend," he said in a calm even voice, "I will be much obliged to thee,
for a place in thy boat, in case thou art bound for Camden?"</p>

<p>"And I," said a harsh and shrill voice at his side, "Will give you five
dollars, if you will row me over in time for the New York Cars&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The person who last spoke, was clad in an overcoat of coarse grey, buttoned
up to his throat, with a fur cap drawn down over his head, and a
large black kerchief, tied round his cheeks and mouth. From between the
upraised collar of his coat, and his dark fur cap, a few locks of snow-white
hair, fell waving on the wind.</p>

<p>"Come on gentlemen," said the old fisherman in his bluff, hearty tones,
"Jump in the boat, an' I'll spin you over like a top! Take that seat in the
st<i>a</i>rn! Now then, trim boat, and away we go!"</p>

<p>The boat darted from the wharf, with the old fisherman seated in the centre,
while Lorrimer and Petriken, occupied the front seat, and the Quaker
sate beside the old man, in the stern.</p>

<p>For a few moments, all was silent, save the sullen dipping of the oars.
One thick mass of clouds, lay over the city, and along the western horizon,
a dense gloom covered the face of the waters, not a ray shone over the surface
of a rippling billow, not a single golden beam, lighted on the crest
of a rolling wave. Lorrimer turned his face over his shoulder, and glanced
vacantly at the other occupants of the boat; there was a calm smile on the
face of the quaker, but the man in the gray surtout, sate with his head
drooped on his folded arms, while his long white hair lay floating on his
shoulders. One eager glance at the sky, and Lorrimer gazed in the pallid
face of Petriken, who sate like a statue by his side. He was about to speak
to his minion, but the strange gloom, which fell from the clouds upon the
waters, cast its shadow on his soul.</p>

<p>"It is a cold wind, my friend," said the Quaker, to the old man in the

<!-- page 485 -->

grey surtout, "A bitter cold wind. And look yonder, surely those are
snow flakes, tossing in the air?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is cold," was the reply of the old man by his side, as he sate
with his head drooped upon his folded arms.</p>

<p>There was something so harsh and repulsive in the manner of this man,
that the old Quaker, apparently baulked in his effort to start a conversation
with him, addressed his next remark to the boatman.</p>

<p>"Can thee tell me friend, whether this darkness, is caused by the clouds,
or is it sunset, indeed?"</p>

<p>"Sunset?" echoed Lorrimer, turning in his seat, and gazing over the
boatman's shoulder into the Quaker's face. "Who talks of sunset? Ah&mdash;excuse,
me sir," he continued, as if startled by his own abruptness, "I
thought the remark was addressed to me. But tell, me my good fellow,
has the sun gone down, or is this sudden darkness, but the shadow of yonder
wall of clouds?"</p>

<p>"It wants five&mdash;p'rhaps ten minutes of sunset, young gentleman," was
the answer of the boatman.</p>

<p>Lorrimer turned his face to the Jersey shore, with an expression, strange
and doubtful in its character. True, his dark hazel eyes, gleamed with a
steady glance, true, his manly cheek glowed with a ruddy hue, but there
was a gloom on his brow, as vague and undefinable as the shadow resting
on the bosom of the Delaware.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" he muttered, "The boat creeps along with a snail's pace.
Would I could feel my feet upon the solid ground again&mdash;would&mdash;Why
Silly you sit there like a stone. Why don't you say something man?"</p>

<p>"The fact is Gus, my spirits, are rather low," returned the little man,
with chattering teeth. "It's cursed cold on the river, too; that wind cuts
a fellow like knives!"</p>

<p>There was silence in the boat again. She darted over the waves with a
light careering motion, while the dipping of the oars into the sullen waters,
struck the ear, with a wild and mournful sound. The dark atmosphere
was whitened with falling snow flakes, which came down with a fluttering
motion, and sunk into the waves, like birds, dissolving all at once into thin air.</p>

<p>In silence the boat approached the island which arises in the lordly Delaware.
She entered the canal, which divides this bank of land in twain; the
sound of the dipping oars broke on the air, mingled with the hoarse murmurs
of the waves, as they dashed against the oaken planks which line the shores
of the channel. Still all was gloom upon the waters, still the flakes of snow
came gently down, still all was silence within the boat.</p>

<p>This channel was soon cleared; the city lay on the west like a black wall
of houses, roofs, and mast-heads; the boat darted toward the Camden shore.</p>

<p>Lorrimer's head was bent on his breast. Thoughts of his home came
gathering around his heart like dear hopes and sad farewells. He beheld
the parlor, lighted by the Christmas Eve fire, he saw the form of his mother,

<!-- page 486 -->

the angel-face of his sister. And then the thought of Mary, the betrayed,
the dishonored, came over him, grim and ghastly as a pall flung over a bed
of roses.</p>

<p>"Would to God, we could reach the Jersey shore!" he muttered.
"My foot once on that soil, all these gloomy thoughts will banish&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The clouds broke in the west, in glorious piles and towers and pinnacles
they broke, and the red sun poured a flood of glory over the waters, as their
rolling subsided to a soft and undulating motion. Every tiny wave was gold,
every ripplet quivered in floods of voluptuous light.</p>

<p>Lorrimer glanced over his shoulder. The aged Quaker, was gazing round
in calm delight, while the old man in the grey coat, still sate with his head
drooped on his folded arms. With a murmur of admiration, he gazed upon
the distant city, as its steeples rose in living light. The river was a sheet
of floating gold; the western horizon was filled with a gorgeous world of
clouds, rising pile on pile, with the light of the setting sun streaming over
the spires and roof of the city, while the white snow-flakes floated in the air,
like birds, whose hues were beautiful as the rays of a star.</p>

<p>Never had the sky looked so gorgeous, the river so lovely, the city so much
like home.</p>

<p>With a murmur of delight, Lorrimer rose on his feet, gazing toward the
west with dilating eyes.</p>

<p>The full glory of the sun poured over his manly form as it rose in all its
towering height; it shone gladly over his face, with its handsome features,
the curving lip darkened by a mustache, the glowing cheeks, the open brow,
with the brown locks tossing in the air. His eyes were full of life, his brow
grew radiant with the deep joy of existence, quivering through every vein.
He stood the incarnation of manly glory and pride.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha," he muttered in a half audible tone, " 'On Christmas Eve at the
hour of sundown, one of ye, will die by the other's hand!' Ha, ha! The
shadow is gone from my soul. It is Christmas Eve, and the prophecy is false!"</p>

<p>He gazed toward the massive edifice of the Navy Yard, and then as he
stood with out-spread arms, his eye was attracted by some object, floating in
the water near the boat. It was a fur cap half concealed by a mass of waving
grey hair: while a syllable of wonder trembled on his lip, he turned his gaze
to the boat, and the life-blood at his heart grew cold.</p>

<p>There, there, right before his face, at the back of the old boatman, stood
a quivering form, there his eye met the gaze of a dark eye, flashing incarnate
hate, there his sight was blasted by the vision of a livid face, with long
dark hair, streaming wildly aside from a brow like death. The stranger,
whose hair was white, had vanished. In his place towered the form of the
Avenger, Byrnewood Arlington!</p>

<p>Lorrimer gave but a single look, and then, frozen with a strange horror,
he beheld the arm extended, he saw that pale hand, he saw the pistol
pointed at his heart.</p>

<!-- page 487 -->

<p>"Back!" he shrieked, "You dare not murder me. The Prophecy is
false&mdash;&mdash;hah!"</p>

<p>"In the name of Mary Arlington&mdash;die!" was the awful and deliberate
sentence of the Avenger.</p>

<p>There was the sudden report of a pistol, there was a cloud of curling
blue smoke. In a moment it cleared away. His clenched hand raised
stiffly in the air, his chest heaving with an awful agony, his parted lips disclosing
his gnashing teeth, his hazel eyes bulging from their sockets, Lorrimer
stood for a single instant, and then with a faintly-muttered name, he fell.</p>

<p>"Mary!" the word gurgled upward with his death groan, as he lay with
his back against the hard plank of the seat, while his head sunk to the bottom
of the boat. A thick stream of blood gushed from his chest, and stained
the hands of the boatman; Petriken's livid face was red with the life-current
of the Libertine.</p>

<p>With one simultaneous cry of horror, the Quaker, the boatman, and the
minion, started to their feet. The boat quivered like a child's toy, on the
agitated waves.</p>

<p>That cry of horror shook the air again!</p>

<p>Byrnewood Arlington knelt on the bottom of the tossing boat, the dead
man's head upon his knees.</p>

<p>His face was the face of a maniac. Every feature quivered, every lineament
trembled with a joy, more horrible than death. His black eyes, stood
out from their sockets; his dark hair waved in the beams of the setting sun.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" the shout burst from his lips. "Here is blood warm, warm,
aye warm and gushing! Is that the murmur of a brook, is that the whisper
of a breeze, is that the song of a bird? No, no, but still it is music&mdash;that
gushing of the Wronger's blood! Deeply wronged, Mary, deeply, darkly
wronged! But fully avenged, Mary, aye to the last drop of his blood!
Have you no music there, I would dance, yes, yes, I would dance over the
Corse! Ha, ha, ha! Not the sound of the organ, that is too dark and
gloomy! But the drum, the trumpet, the chorus of a full band; fill heaven
and earth with joy! For in sight of God and his angels, I would dance over
the corse, while a wild song of joy, fills the heavens! A song&mdash;huzza&mdash;a
song! And the chorus, mark ye how it swells! Huzza!</p>

<p>"This, this is the vengeance of a Brother!"</p>

<h3>THE CONCLUSION.</h3>

</div>

<p>IN a deep forest wild, a maiden form bent over a spring of clear cold water
which bubbled upward from among a mass of green leaves, near the foot of
a giant oak. She bent down on the velvet moss, while the green leaves of
shrubbery encircling her on every side, and the thick branches of trees, meeting
overhead in a canopy of verdure, made the place seem like a fairy bower
of some olden story.</p>

<p>She bent down over the spring, not with a cup or a goblet in her hand,
but with a white lily, trembling in her delicate fingers, as its petals dipped
gently into the waters. Those waters, so clear, so cold, so tranquil, reflected
the outlines of a fair young face, the gleam of two mild blue eyes, the graceful
flow of light brown hair, tossed gently on the summer air. As she gazed
into this living mirror, a single ray of sunlight fell quivering from the canopy
overhead, and trembled on the bosom of the spring, while a smile stole over
the maiden's face. It was a smile, but sad and mournful as a knell; it was a
smile, but gloomy as a sunbeam falling over the grave of youth and beauty.</p>

<p>Suddenly the maiden uprose from her kneeling posture. She placed the
lily on her bosom, and with a light step threaded the mazes of a winding path
that led around the trunks of colossal trees, over the softly tufted moss, and
beneath the shade of leafy branches. Now the strain of some wild and
melancholy song burst from her lips, and now with her blue eyes upturned,
she gazed vacantly upon a glimpse of the blue heavens, murmuring strange
words to herself all the while. Again she bounded on her way, until dashing
a mass of green leaves aside, she stood upon the brow of a gentle hill,
with the summer wind playing among her dark brown tresses, while her blue
eyes shone with a calm and holy delight.</p>

<p>A calm sheet of water, embosomed in the crest of the mountain, with banks
high and rugged, clothed with forest trees, or gentle and sloping, crowned
with soft and luxuriant shrubbery, a calm sheet of water, with its stainless
depths resting in the smile of the summer sky, like a sleeping child beneath
its mother's gaze! Such was the vision that burst on the delighted eye of
the maiden, while her ears were soothed by the melody of the wood-bird's
song, mingling with the murmur of a brooklet, echoing from the bosom of
the shrubbery around the foot of the knoll, as it sank gently into the waters
of the mountain lake.</p>

<p>The maiden gazed upon this scene of calm loveliness, while a mournful
expression stole over her face, as though some memory of the past came
sadly to her soul.</p>

<p>Arising from the centre of a fair garden that bloomed over the slope of
glade, declining gently to the water's brink, a cottage over-shadowed by a

<!-- page 489 -->

grove of forest trees, with vines trailing round its arching windows, and
winding walks leading down to the lake, broke on the maiden's eye like
a vision of a happy home, reared by the hands of love in the solitude of the
wilderness. The cottage, two stories in height, with arching windows and a
steep, gabled roof, arose from a flowery knoll not more than a hundred yards
from the spot where the maiden stood.</p>

<p>The faint yellow hue of the cottage walls, was in beautiful contrast, with
the verdure of the vines, trailing round its windows, the deep green of the
branches, waving above its roof, the brown gravelled paths of the garden
or the beds of flowers scattered all around, with the sunbeams gleaming
over rose and lily, as they waved gently to the summer air.</p>

<p>Suddenly the sound of footsteps came faintly to the maiden's ear.
Turning toward the forest, she beheld two forms advancing along a wide
gravelled walk, which sloped down toward the knoll, with the interwoven
branches, forming a verdant arch overhead. A fair girl, supported the arm
of an aged woman, whose tall form, clad in deep black, was in strong contrast,
with the light figure at her side, also attired in robes of sable. They
came slowly along the walk; they perceived the form of the maiden clad
in light robes; in a moment they reached her side.</p>

<p>"We have lost our way in the forest, Miss," cried the aged lady gazing
upon the beautiful face of the girl, with an expression of wonder mingled
with admiration, "In company with a party of our friends, we left the valley
of Wyoming this morning, with the intention of enjoying the free air of
these mountains. But having missed our friends, we are forced to ask you,
to direct us to the wood, which leads from the forest&mdash;"</p>

<p>The maiden in robes of white made no reply. Her blue eyes were enchained
by the face of the maiden, who accompanied the aged lady. With
slow footsteps she advanced to her side, she laid her hands gently on her
shoulders, and with a wild gaze perused each feature of her beautiful countenance.
She was indeed beautiful as a dream. Waving tresses of auburn
hair, mingling the purple dyes of sunset with the deep black of midnight,
relieved a fair countenance, whose pale brow was impressed with an expression
of deep sadness, whose dark hazel eyes were full of thoughtful sorrow.</p>

<p>There they stood gazing in each other's faces, these two images of youth
and loveliness, while the aged dame, looked from countenance to countenance,
with an expression of mute wonder.</p>

<p>The free sunbeams and the glad summer air came through the windows
of the cottage. In a small room, furnished in a style of neatness, combined
with taste, sate a man in the prime of early manhood. His form was thrown
listlessly in a large arm-chair, while his arms were lightly folded across
his chest. His high forehead, was rendered deathly pale, by the ebon
blackness of his hair, which fell in thick masses down to his shoulders.
His dark eyes dilating with an expression of intense thought, glared steadily

<!-- page 490 -->

in the air, while his nether lip quivered with a tremulous motion. Hi
countenance was pale, yet it was not the pallor of disease, but of long, deep
and absorbing thought. And as a stray sunbeam fell over his brow, or as
his black hair, was tossed aside from his face, by an occasional breath of
wind, low-muttered words broke from his lips, words fraught with many a
bitter memory, or dear hope of the by-gone time.</p>

<p>While he sits there, in that silent room, wrapt in strange thought, we will
glance at the contents of a newspaper, that lay among some books and letters,
on the table by his side.</p>

<p>It was dated, Philadelphia, June&mdash;&mdash;1843.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"Among the passengers in the steamship, Great Western, which
sailed from New York, yesterday morning, was our respected townsman,
Luke Harvey, Esq., of the firm of Harvey and Arlington, late Livingstone,
Harvey and Co. His bride, the daughter of the late Albert Livingstone,
Esq.&mdash;who with his wife, was destroyed in the conflagration of the country
mansion of Hawkewood&mdash;accompanies our friend to Europe, where it is
said, an immense fortune, if not a title, has fallen to her, through the due
course of law. Many of our readers, will remember the romantic story of
Miss Izol&eacute; Livingstone's former life. Stolen in her infancy from her father's
arms, she was, after the lapse of seventeen years recognized and restored to
her home, through the kind exertions of our distinguished Divine, the Rev.
Dr. Pyne. The facts of the case, are briefly these&mdash;* * * * *.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"At an enthusiastic meeting of the American Patent-Gospel Association,
the thanks of a large and respectable audience, were tendered to the
Rev. Dr. Pyne, for his able speech on the Iniquities of the Pope of Rome.
We understood, that this worthy and eminent divine, will shortly publish in
book form, a complete history of the Popes of Rome, from the earliest ages,
down to the present time * * * * *.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"We are happy to inform our readers, that the base rumors, which
some malignant enemies, have set in circulation, with regard to the reputation
of our distinguished friend, Algernon Fitz-Cowles, Esq., have been effectually
crushed, by an undeniable manifestation of public opinion. At a <i>recherch&eacute;</i>
supper, given by the gallant Colonel, to a select party of friends,
the following toast was given by Judge Singesam * * * * *.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"Strange rumors, float on the tide of public opinion, with regard to
a new secret order, entitled the Brothers of the Sacred Urn. It is said to
have been founded by the Impostor Ravoni, who after having duped our
citizens, with his Mad-House and other charlatanisms, has so mysteriously
vanished from the city * * * * *.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"Peggy Grud, convicted of murder in the second degree, was yesterday
pardoned, by our truly merciful Governor * * * * Mrs. Nancy Perkins,
a respectable widow lady, who lives retired, in an ancient mansion,
situated in the southern part of the city, was yesterday tried on a scandalous

<!-- page 491 -->

charge, originated by some designing enemies. She was acquitted by
the jury, without leaving the box * * * *.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"The dead body of a woman was found on last Thursday, in the
graveyard of L&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;in this state. The corpse when discovered, was
laying beside the grave of Mr. Walraven, once a highly respectable citizen
of the town, but now some years deceased. The unknown female was
dressed in deep black, her hair was very dark, and her face retained some
tokens of former beauty. Having no friends to claim her corse, she was
buried in the graveyard of the county poorhouse. * * * * *."</p>

<p>In an obscure corner of the paper, crowded up among a multitude of advertisements,
was the following brief and expressive Postscript.</p>

<p>"The villain who perpetrated the wholesale forgery, on several houses in
New York, Charleston and New Orleans, was arrested last night, just before
our paper went to press. He was taken to New York, under care of
the police, heavily ironed, in order to baulk any effort to escape. He proves
to be, no less a personage than the <i>notorious</i> Algernon Fitz-Cowles, who
has been displaying himself in Chestnut Street, for a year or two past. * * * * *.</p>

<p>"We also learn, from the best authority, that one of our first clergymen has
been guilty of a most daring and atrocious act of perfidy. As the case will
shortly be brought to trial, we refrain from giving the particulars. Suffice
to say, that the <i>victim</i> is the daughter of one of our wealthiest merchants,
the heartless seducer, none other than the <i>Reverend Doctor F. A. T. Pyne</i>,
author of several works on the Iniquities of the Pope, etc., etc., etc."</p>

<p>While the record of human weakness, wretchedness and crime, lay fluttering
on the table, the head of the young man, drooped slowly down, until
his face rested on his folded arms. There was a world of meaning in the
steady gaze of his dilating eye, which glared beneath his woven brows.</p>

<p>The silence of the room, was scarcely broken by the opening of the door.
A beautiful woman, advanced with a softened footstep and stole gently
to the back of the chair. Her clustering hair, fell in thick tresses of
gold, aside from a mild countenance, or whose fair outlines were written
the tenderness of a mother, the deep and abiding love of a wife. In her
extended arms, she held a sweet and laughing child, whose tiny fingers
wandered playfully through the dark locks of the father's hair.</p>

<p>And there in that quiet parlor sate the man of the pallid brow, with his
face drooped on his folded arms, wrapt in deep and terrible thought, while
at the back of his chair leaning over his downcast head, was the form of a
fair and lovely woman, with a laughing babe in her extended hands.</p>

<p>"Byrnewood!" whispered the soft voice of the wife.</p>

<p>He raised his head; he beheld the beaming countenance of his wife, the
laughing face of his child.</p>

<!-- page 492 -->

<p>"Annie!" he whispered, while a smile of pleasure, warmed over his
pale face.</p>

<p>He rose from his seat, but that smile was gone. The dark thought was
on his soul again; he turned from his wife and child toward the door of
that chamber, from which he never emerged, without a flashing eye and
gloomy brow.</p>

<p>"Oh Byrnewood, do not enter that chamber to-day," said the soft pleading
voice of his wife. "I have never sought to know the Secret of that
dreary place, I have never crossed its threshold. But this I know, that
you are always dark and gloomy, after you have spent but a moment,
within its walls. Do not enter the chamber to-day, Byrnewood, do not I
beseech you!"</p>

<p>"This day Annie, for the last time!" said Byrnewood, as he took the
key from his pocket and inserted it, in the lock. "After to-day, that room,
shall never make me sad or gloomy."</p>

<p>With a melancholy smile he opened the door, passed into the chamber, and
closed it again. It was a small and narrow room, with a plain carpet on the
floor, a table standing in one corner, and an arching window opening on the
lake. Through the half closed curtains of this window, came the warm sunshine,
the cool air, and a glimpse of the clear waters, the deep forests and
fragrant flowers.</p>

<p>In the centre of the wall opposite the door, a long curtain of dark velvet
hung drooping from the ceiling to the floor. Byrnewood stood opposite this
curtain, with his arms sternly folded on his breast, while a fearful agitation
convulsed each lineament of his expressive countenance.</p>

<p>"Ha! I remember it well," he muttered, "I remember it well! There,
there I stood, with the gaze of the callous mob fixed upon my face, the stern
visages of the jury, and the iron countenance of the Judge, these were all
before me! I stood in the presence of my fate.</p>

<p>"There too were the lawyers, full of craft and cunning. They had anticipated
long speeches, ingenious pleas, knotty points of law&mdash;ha, ha! How I
baulked them all! I remember it yet. 'Plead not guilty,' whispered my
lawyer. I smiled in my heart. I knew his plan. He would clear me from
the gibbet or the gaol, by the paltry plea of insanity! <i>I</i> insane! when my
soul was firm as its own despair, when my hand was true as the weapon it
grasped! 'Guilty or not guilty!' whined the clerk.</p>

<p>" 'Guilty!' I shouted, rising to my feet, while my lawyers, started up
with dismay. 'Guilty in the sight of God! I am charged with this man's
murder; I did murder him! Yes, yes, as a dog should die, he died! I had
a fair and stainless sister, gentlemen, my grey-haired father had a pure and
innocent daughter! On that daughter's happiness hung the life of a true-hearted
mother. Yes, yes, your Honor, that daughter, was the hope and
joy of three persons, a father, a mother, a brother; and each of these would
have given their life for her!</p>

<!-- page 493 -->

<p>" 'A libertine came; he lured this girl from her home; he perjured his soul
that he might betray her! He did betray her! Betrayed, polluted, dishonored,
she returned to her father's house!</p>

<p>" 'And think ye, that there was no Brother to avenge her wrong? Ha,
ha! There was a brother. He pursued the libertine. He overtook the craven,
in his guilty flight! Calling on the High God to nerve his arm, and
send the bullet home, he shot the Libertine, as in the flush of triumphant
guilt, he stood glorying in his crime. Not guilty? Ha, ha! I am guilty
I am the murderer, I shot the libertine, and would shoot him again! Now
gentlemen, convict me if you can! Now your Honor, pass sentence of death
upon me if you can!</p>

<p>" 'Here I rest my defence; on this I peril life and honor! He wronged
my sister and he died!'</p>

<p>"How that glad shout rung through the Court House! Not guilty! I was
free!"</p>

<p>As this wild soliloquy trembled from his lips in broken murmurs, he tore
aside the velvet drapery, and a portrait was revealed. It was the portrait of
Gustavus Lorrimer! Strolling into the studio of a celebrated artist, Byrnewood
had seen this picture, and having ascertained that it was a copy of a
portrait, painted for Lorrimer a month before his death, he purchased it, and
brought it to his mountain retreat among the wilds of Wyoming. There was
the same laughing face of manly beauty, the same dark hazel eye, the scornful
lip, with its dark mustache, the flowing locks of dark brown hair. There
was the portrait, gleaming in the light of the sun, while the handsome Gus
Lorrimer lay rotting in his grave, six feet below the glad earth, smiling in
the summer sun.</p>

<p>The Avenger knew that he was right in the sight of God, in the execution
of the fearful deed which had been death to the Libertine, but still there was
one thought, never absent from his soul. At his board, on his pillow, in the
walk through the wild wood or the crowded city, the face of Lorrimer was
ever with him. He found an awful pleasure in contemplating the portrait
of the Libertine. He had avenged his sister's wrong, but the memory of the
scenes he had witnessed in Monk-Hall, in the parlor of his father's house, in
the streets of the Quaker City, or on the broad river, dwelt like a shadow on
his soul.</p>

<p>While Byrnewood Arlington stood gazing intently upon the portrait, the
door slowly opened, and three figures entered the room. His reverie was
deep and absorbing; he did not hear the sound of the opening door, nor the
tread of footsteps. An aged dame, clad in deep black, a fair young girl in
robes white as snow, and a maiden attired in sable, with auburn hair floating
along each youthful cheek&mdash;these all, unknown and unperceived, stood at the
Brother's side.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he cried, with a sudden start as he perceived the intruders. "Mary,
have I not told you, never to cross that threshold&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<!-- page 494 -->

<p>His words were drowned in the wild shriek that quivered on each lip.
They beheld the portrait; they sank kneeling on the floor.</p>

<p>"My child!" shrieked the dame, and she clasped her hands in silent agony.</p>

<p>"My brother!" cried the maiden in black, and she buried her face in her
bosom, while her auburn hair floated over her trembling hands.</p>

<p>The girl in robes of flowing white, knelt on the floor with her eyes so full
of unutterable feeling, centered on the portrait, her cheek flushed with strange
emotions, and her clasped hands raised on high. A single word burst from
her lips, a single word, uttered in a whisper, like the sigh of a broken heart&mdash;"LORRAINE!"</p>
