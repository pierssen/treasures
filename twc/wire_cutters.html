<h2>THE WIRE-CUTTERS</h2>

<p>I</p>

<p class="small">THE PORTRAIT</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hilliard</span> met the messenger at her front
gate.</p>

<p>She had seen him from an upper window, coming
along the plantation road, his open buggy almost
overtopped by the tall cane on either side. She
felt sure that the coatless person in blue linen
trousers and panama hat, who approached in a
leisurely fashion warranted by the heat of the
September afternoon, was the bearer of the long-expected 
decision. She turned, trembling, from
the window, seized by an almost irresistible impulse 
to rush into an inner room, close and lock
the door, and so at least postpone the inevitable
revelation. The next moment she had caught
up a garden hat and was descending the broad
stairway, pale but composed, at least in outward
appearance. She waved back the negro lad who
had started on a run to open the gate, and passed
swiftly along the shaded carriage-drive.</p>

<p>Lilla Hilliard, thus advancing to meet the decree 

<!-- page 2 -->

which, according to proper calculation, should
restore her to freedom, but which, on the other
hand, might condemn her to a lifetime of mortification 
and wretchedness, was an extremely beautiful 
young woman. A little past two and twenty
years of age, she was tall and erect, with a slight
yet well-rounded figure, which swayed, as she
walked, like a lily on its stem. Her head was
crowned with a luxurious mass of blond hair rippling 
away from a somewhat narrow but very white
forehead. The delicate lines of her eyebrows, distinctly 
darker than her hair, arched above eyes of
a clear, almost startling blue. The perfect oval
of her face was unmarred by seam or dimple. Her
mouth and chin alone arrested unsatisfactory attention. 
These suggested something indefinable&mdash;a
something which meant firmness or hardness, according 
to the more or less lenient judgment of the
observer.</p>

<p>Her black gown trailed on the shelled drive,
making no noise, but her light footsteps echoed
loudly in her own ears, and her heart beat audibly
as she drew near the tall iron gates. The buggy
had come to a halt in the road outside. A moment 
earlier the driver, a sallow young man with
shrewd black eyes, a sharp nose, and a wide, expressive 
mouth, had loosed his tongue for a halloo
and a ready curse on the tardy negro gate-opener.
But at sight of the mistress of Eastwood he
jerked on his coat and leaped to the ground.</p>

<p>"Good-day, Mrs. Hilliard," he said respectfully,

<!-- page 3 -->

taking off his hat as he approached. His face
betrayed, in spite of himself, his intimate acquaintance 
with her affairs.</p>

<p>He lifted the heavy bar, and one of the gates
swung slowly outward.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Milgrove," she returned,
with haughty resentment of his knowledge. "You
come, I presume, from Mr. Ralston?"</p>

<p>Milgrove drew back the hand which he had instinctively 
put out. "I left Mr. Ralston this
morning," he said, a slight flush rising to his thin
cheeks. He turned to the buggy and took some
papers from a small leather bag lying on the seat.
"Mr. Ralston wished you to have these as soon
as possible, Mrs. Hilliard, and I volunteered to
bring them over." This time his face was impassive, 
showing no familiarity with the contents of
the official-looking envelope which he handed to
Mr. Ralston's client, or of the suit whose result
it announced, and whose details were far better
known to the lawyer's clerk than to the principals
themselves.</p>

<p>"Thank you." Mrs. Hilliard spoke calmly,
but Milgrove's keen eyes noted the vise-like grasp
of her slim fingers around the envelope which
fluttered visibly against her bosom.</p>

<p>He was chagrined at seeing her turn away, without 
a second glance at himself. He looked after
her as she moved obliquely across the well-kept
lawn and passed up the steps into the house. His
face darkened; he recalled his eagerness in offering 

<!-- page 4 -->

to take the hot twenty-mile drive from St.
Denis, where the court had been sitting, to Eastwood 
plantation; he remembered the airy visions
which had beguiled that drive! He had foreseen
himself called into the stately library at Eastwood
to read and explain to its beautiful chatelaine the
important document of which he was the bearer,&mdash;perhaps 
to give legal advice, or even counsel of
a personal and more intimate character; he had
basked in advance in the sunshine of her lovely
eyes! He smiled, grimly humorous, at a reality
which left him standing&mdash;a forgotten lackey&mdash;without 
the gates. "Oh, very well, Lady Lilla,"
he muttered. "Our account may stand over."</p>

<p>"Mis' Lilla say please come in, Mist' Milgrove.
Yo' dinner gwine to be served in de co'se o' pre-sent'y; 
an' yo' nag fed an' fresh-up, befo' you
drives back to town."</p>

<p>Samp, the negro lad, threw open the gates as he
spoke; and Milgrove stepped into his buggy and
drove up the circular carriage-way to the house.</p>

<p>It was not until she had reached the library and
closed the door behind her, that Mrs. Hilliard
broke the seal of the bulky envelope. There was
a letter within, in the lawyer's well-known handwriting, 
and a copy of the final decree issued by
the court in the case entitled: <i>Lilla Hilliard vs.
Leroy Hilliard. Petition for Absolute Divorce.</i>
Her lips whitened as she glanced over the page.
Its technical phrases made but a confused impression 
on her agitated senses. But the conclusion

<!-- page 5 -->

was unmistakably clear. The plea was granted,
unconditionally. She was free, and privileged to
resume her maiden name.</p>

<p>She dropped the paper, sobbing hysterically,
and covered her face with her hands. But almost
instantly her sobs ceased. She arose and walked
deliberately to her own writing-desk placed in the
sunny curve of a bay-window, and drawing a sheet
of paper toward her, she wrote her new name,&mdash;that 
name she had renounced three years before
to assume the one she now so gladly discarded. It
had an oddly familiar look,&mdash;<i>Armstead, Lilla
Armstead</i>. She wrote it several times in the
slender, delicate characters then in vogue, and
continued to gaze at it with fascinated eyes, while
Ralston's personal letter slipped from her lap and
lay on the floor at her feet.</p>

<p class="center">• • • • • • • • •</p>

<p>Lilla Armstead was barely eighteen when Leroy
Hilliard came from his home in South Carolina on
a prolonged visit to Eastwood Plantation. His
father and her own had been friends and classmates 
at college, and it was not without a secret
intention on the part of Henry Armstead that the
young people were thus familiarly thrown together.
He watched the first meeting between his motherless 
girl, and only child, and the son of his old
friend, hardly able to repress his delight upon
seeing how exactly the superb young pair seemed
mated. Lilla's blond beauty and fragile grace
had never indeed showed to such advantage as

<!-- page 6 -->

when contrasted with the dark comeliness and
massive strength of the young Carolinian.</p>

<p>Hilliard was rather below the medium height,
but the perfect proportion of his powerful sinewy
body almost invariably made him seem taller than
the men around him. His features, though open
and engaging, were strongly marked; the square
chin showed great firmness,&mdash;perhaps obstinacy;
the perpendicular furrow on the broad forehead
was an open warning of a hot temper. But the
head, with its close-cropped bronze curls, was a
fine one, nobly poised upon the supple neck, and
the tawny brown eyes had a singular look of softness 
beneath the black brows and lashes,&mdash;like
the unexpected gleam of a mountain tarn beneath
wild and rugged cliffs.</p>

<p>An ardent hunter, an excellent horseman, graceful 
in the dance as in the salle d'escrime, gay,
daring, responsive, and masterful, small wonder
was it that this well-born, wealthy, and cultivated
stranger should have caught, almost from the moment 
of his arrival, the fancy of beautiful Lilla
Armstead,&mdash;the spoiled and petted queen of Eastwood. 
The attraction was mutual; the wooing
short and impetuous. The June roses were blooming 
when Hilliard first came riding, like a knight
of romance, along the levee-road to the great old-time 
plantation-house on the Mississippi River.
In September, after a brief return to his paternal
home in Carolina, he came again to claim his promised 
bride. The wedding was celebrated with

<!-- page 7 -->

unusual pomp and ceremony at Eastwood. The
stately mansion, famous for its hospitality, threw
wide its doors for this occasion to a brilliant array
of guests from the city and from the surrounding
parishes. The humbler folk of the neighborhood
were feasted during two whole days in ample tents
on the lawn; the Eastwood negroes entertained in
their own quarters the coachmen, body-servants,
maids, hostlers, and other retainers who swelled
the wedding-train. When the newly married pair&mdash;walking 
on roses&mdash;descended the veranda steps
to the carriage which conveyed them to the boat-landing 
on the river, there was among all these
guests and dependents but one opinion: here at
last was that rare and wonderful happening, a
suitable match!</p>

<p>Mr. Armstead, who was already in failing health,
lived long enough to see his son-in-law display extraordinary 
ability in the management of the vast
sugar-plantation. This completed his own satisfaction 
and self-gratulation. He died, having but
one longing left ungratified,&mdash;the desire to hold
in his arms, before he looked his last on fair Eastwood, 
an heir to its broad acres.</p>

<p>The heir did not come, either before or after
Henry Armstead's death. But in its place was
born something which soon waxed lusty enough
and terrible enough to drive Hilliard into long
absences from home, and change his wife into a
pale shadow of her former self. His scowling face
startled more than one belated traveler hurrying

<!-- page 8 -->

along the country roads at midnight; his voice,
grown harsh and defiant, echoed in disreputable
squabbles over card-tables and across rude bars in
the little town of St. Denis, twenty miles from
Eastwood; he made frequent trips down the river
to the city, and came back wearing each time a
more dare-devil expression on his dark, handsome
face. Meantime, Lilla, white and reserved, sat
alone in her pew in the small neighborhood church,
drove alone in her carriage, flitted alone&mdash;a sad-eyed 
ghost&mdash;about the silent rose-garden at Eastwood.</p>

<p>What was the trouble? Whence or whose the
influence which wrought these monstrous effects?
No one could divine. But that there was serious
discord between this apparently perfectly mated
pair was only too evident. People at first were too
amazed to say "I told you so." But it presently
began to be remembered that Leroy Hilliard had
been known to flash into inexplicable rage over
some commonplace trifle; and that at such times
he was not a pleasant person to deal with. His
losses at the gaming-table were reported, and exaggerated,&mdash;a 
man surely does not become a gambler 
in a day! He had been seen reeling, under
the influence of liquor, across the gang-plank of
the river-packet to the landing,&mdash;it takes time
to make a drunkard! The case became plain
enough to friend and gossip. Hilliard was a gamester, 
an unfaithful husband, a sot, a wife-beater.
Lilla, whose fine reticence concerning her troubles

<!-- page 9 -->

excited general admiration, was surely an unselfish
martyr!</p>

<p>After two and a half years of such married life,
this abhorred husband disappeared altogether, leaving 
his horses in the Eastwood stables, his other
personal and private belongings in the Eastwood
mansion, his reputation to any tongue that chose
to wag, and the bitter secret of their difference in
the breast of the woman whom he had called his
wife.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hilliard followed for some months the
dreary routine to which she had accustomed herself; 
seeing no one, rarely stirring abroad, companioned 
only by Miss Bolton, the old maiden
aunt who had, after her mother's death, assumed
nominal care of her. At the end of six months
she took a step which fairly electrified the community,&mdash;it 
may almost be said, the entire State.
She made application for a divorce.</p>

<p>At that time, some forty-five years ago, the
very word <i>divorce</i> was spoken, if spoken at all,
with bated breath; the thing itself carried with it
all manner of ignominy and disgrace. It seemed
incredible that a member&mdash;a woman!&mdash;of a proud
old family like the Armsteads should so scandalize
public opinion! But Mrs. Hilliard, consulting no
one but Edmund Ralston, her father's trusted
lawyer, held quietly on her way in the matter.
The most rigid moralist, indeed, could hardly blame
the young creature, who for more than two years
had suffered every indignity which a cruel and

<!-- page 10 -->

dissipated husband could heap upon her. The affair, 
which was most delicately managed, brought
her in the long run almost universal compassion,&mdash;a 
compassion which was tinged with a certain
awe of her courage.</p>

<p>The charges against Hilliard, it was understood,
were ill-treatment and abandonment. The case
dragged a little; everything, even the courts of
justice in those leisurely days, moved with dignified 
slowness. Hilliard filed no answer to the
charges against him. He maintained an obstinate
silence, and failed to put in an appearance when
the case was called. And now, after some eight
months of waiting, the injured wife held in her
hand the order of the court granting her absolute
freedom.</p>

<p>She read Ralston's letter. It was filled with
formal advice and stately congratulations.</p>

<p>"With a stroke of the pen, my dear Lilla," he
said, "the past has been set at naught." But had
it? "And you may now order your life as may
best suit you. I trust you will do this wisely. I
will come to Eastwood within the week," he concluded, 
"and there confer with you in person on
all matters further pertaining to this and other
business."</p>

<p>She seized her pen again and wrote a few lines
in reply, then leaned idly back in her chair, flushed
and happy. A hummingbird circled above her
head, and darted out again through an open window. 
She followed its flashing flight with her eyes;

<!-- page 11 -->

then with a sudden impulse, she rose, pushed open
a blind, stepped out upon the veranda, and walked
rapidly down the steps into the rose-garden at its
farther end.</p>

<p>When she re&euml;ntered the house, she wore on her
fair hair a wreath of crimson rosebuds. A fanciful 
girdle of the same flowers, intertwined with
feathery sprays of the cypress-vine, encircled her
slender hips; the heavy, half-blown buds emitted
a warm perfume and glowed like molten embers
against the dead black of her gown. She looked
suddenly barbaric and splendid.</p>

<p>"Why, Lilla!" exclaimed Miss Bolton, who
encountered her unexpectedly in the hall. Miss
Bolton was a small, dark-skinned, black-haired,
shriveled-looking old body, with humped shoulders
and timid dark eyes. She stood in great awe of
her dead sister's child,&mdash;the tall, fair, imperious
Lilla, who "took after" her father's people.</p>

<p>"Yes, Aunt Pauline," Lilla said, smiling and
stooping to drop a careless kiss upon the dark
cheek, "I have gone out of mourning! I am
celebrating the happiest moment of my life. I
am Lilla Armstead once more; and I am <i>free,&mdash;free,&mdash;free!</i>"</p>

<p>She passed on, humming the refrain lightly.
Miss Bolton hurried on to the storeroom whither
she was bound, her bunch of housekeeping keys
jingling at her waist. She wiped her eyes furtively, 
terrified at the thought of Lilla seeing the
tears which she could not repress; for whatever

<!-- page 12 -->

the rest of the world thought of Leroy Hilliard,
Aunt Pauline loved him. To her he had been
invariably gentle and chivalrous. He was the only
human being, the little old creature told herself
passionately, who now seemed to remember her
existence. And Lilla&mdash; But here she stopped.
Even to herself she dared not formulate the
thought!</p>

<p>Aunt Pauline, strange to say, was not entirely
alone in her kindly judgment of the absent. Here
and there about the parish there were men&mdash;and
women&mdash;who had a genuine liking for the black
sheep, in spite of his admitted faults and mad
follies. There were children who cherished him
fondly in their solemn little souls; one, at least,
wailed herself sick when told that he had gone
away, for ever and ever. The negroes at Eastwood
without exception adored him. His occasional
outbursts of violence seemed but to deepen their
awesome affection for him. On one occasion, a
powerful black giant, named Jerry,&mdash;the leader
of the field-gang,&mdash;received for some misdemeanor
a chastisement at his hands, almost brutal in its
severity. Such occurrences were rare, a master
in those times seldom coming in direct contact
with his slaves; the report of it flew abroad, and
the same night a negro from a neighboring plantation 
condoled loudly with the supposed sufferer,
coupling his sympathy with a curse on the master.
In an instant, Jerry's sledge-hammer fist had
felled the unfortunate visitor to the ground.</p>

<!-- page 13 -->

<p>"Name o' Gawd, Jerry," growled the discomfited 
sympathizer, scrambling to his feet, "what
mek you do dat?"</p>

<p>"Shet yo' big mouf, nigger!" roared Jerry, hot
with wrath. "Marse Roy kin lay de lash on my
back whenever an' however it suit him. You
heah me? An' ef you don't clar yo'se'f out'n dis
quarter, I gwine ter brek ever' bone in yo' fool
body!"</p>

<p>The house-servants had discussed among themselves 
the unaccountable absence of the master.
They had been for months vaguely aware that
something inimical to him was in progress in "de
co'te," and resented the fact fiercely. When,
therefore, Mrs. Hilliard entered the dining-room
where Samp was respectfully attending Hannibal
the butler, who was rather superciliously attending 
the lawyer's clerk, two keen pairs of eyes
besides Milgrove's own instantly remarked the
change in her manner and appearance.</p>

<p>She stopped near the table where Milgrove was
sitting, with a bottle of wine before him. He
arose and stood in a waiting attitude. "I have a
letter for Mr. Ralston," she began; "will you"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am at your service, Mrs. Armstead," he interrupted, 
with a significant pause on the last word.</p>

<p>Samp pricked up his ears and tipped a wink to
the butler, who on the entrance of his mistress
had become abnormally dignified and polite. He
glided into the pantry and thence made a bee-line
for the kitchen, bursting with news.</p>

<!-- page 14 -->

<p>Lilla smiled and blushed. The smile went far
toward dissipating the poison which had gathered
in Milgrove's soul. The infinitesimal drop which
remained had entirely evaporated in the aura
which surrounds a beautiful woman, by the cool
of the evening when he stepped once more into
his buggy and started on his return drive to St.
Denis.</p>

<p>His hostess watched him pass down the brown
dusty road, between the fields of rustling blue-green 
cane; then she went back to the library.
The rosebuds on her head and about her waist had
opened wide their velvet petals, and showed their
golden hearts. She looked at herself in a pier-glass 
with a smile of satisfaction. Surely she had
never been more beautiful! She was young, and
she was free! At the thought, a face hitherto
resolutely banished from her mind seemed to flash
out and shine, exultant, beside her own in the
mirror. Life stretched out in an enchanting vista
before her.</p>

<p>She turned and swept her eyes triumphantly
around the room, as if calling even the inanimate
objects around her to witness her happiness. She
started back with a sharp cry. A yellow glow
from the sunset sky fell almost weirdly upon a
portrait of Leroy Hilliard, which stood on an easel
in an obscure corner. His dark face looked out
at her from within the gilt frame. She tried to
turn away, but his eyes&mdash;those deep, meaning
eyes&mdash;held her spellbound; the unfathomable

<!-- page 15 -->

smile on his lips terrified her into silence. She
stood for many minutes, like one paralyzed, face
to face with him and with their mutual past.
Scene after scene crowded upon her memory,&mdash;a
series of hideous nightmares, confused but vivid,
which jostled against each other, clamoring for
notice; snatches of words, wooing, passionate,
scornful; looks tender, reproachful, withering;
delirious kisses; echoes of bitter laughter; velvet
touches of caressing fingers; the hot clinch of a
stern hand on her wrist! She crouched at length
to the floor, bowing her head to her knees, unable
longer to bear his wrathful, questioning gaze.</p>

<p>Suddenly a quiver passed along her inert limbs;
she threw up her arms, shaking her clenched fists
in a sort of frenzy, and uttering inarticulate spasmodic 
sounds. She sprang up and bounded to a
cabinet, wrenched open the locked door, and seized
a Sicilian knife, a silver-hilted dagger which
formed a part of Hilliard's own collection of foreign 
weapons. Turning again to the portrait, she
paused a moment. Her livid face expressed the
cunning fury of a wild beast; her eyes blazed with
a green light; her breath came and went in short
labored gasps. "You&mdash;dare&mdash;ah"&mdash; The disjointed 
words choked her. She slashed the keen
blade furiously across the pictured face. The
heavy frame lunged forward under the blow and
fell with a crash, dragging the easel with it.</p>

<p>Miss Bolton, startled by the sound and by the
shriek which echoed through the silent house,

<!-- page 16 -->

rushed into the room. She found her niece
stretched, unconscious, on the floor, with the dagger 
clutched in her hand, her brow death-white
beneath its crown of fading roses.</p>

<p>A deep cut across the cheek gave a curiously
sinister look to Hilliard's face. Lilla Armstead,
recovering consciousness, shuddered as she looked
at it. The mutilated portrait, by her order, was
carried to the garret, and there left to the companionship 
of other discarded and forgotten things.</p>

<p>II</p>

<p class="small">THE CHILD</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span>, a little more than a year after her legal
separation from Hilliard, Lilla Armstead married
again, there was a universal note of disapprobation. 
It was one thing for a woman to sever the
tie which bound her to a brute; it was quite another 
for her to defy world-old prejudice by venturing 
her neck a second time under the yoke. True&mdash;the 
unseemliness of the proceeding aside&mdash;it
was difficult not to admit that here was a match
still more "suitable" than the former one. Francis 
Deerford was not a stranger, but a prosperous
young planter whose handsome estate was separated 
from Eastwood by the yellow flood of the
Mississippi. He had known his fair neighbor
from his and her own childhood; he had wooed
her with a gallant persistence which, though fruitless, 
certainly merited success; and at the time of
her marriage with Hilliard he had gone abroad,
making no secret of his disappointed hopes. His
second and successful wooing, indeed,&mdash;though
frowned upon on principle,&mdash;excited covert admiration. 
It was even said as time passed on,
and Mr. and Mrs. Deerford continued to live in

<!-- page 18 -->

harmony at Eastwood, that Lilla's first marriage
had been an arbitrary arrangement of her father's,
and that in her inmost heart she had never loved
Hilliard; or that her feeling for him at most was
that of the moth under the baleful glamour of the
lamp, or of the charmed bird for the rattlesnake.</p>

<p>Deerford was tall, slender, and blond like his
wife; he was openly vain of his good looks, and
narrow in idea, with certain petty traits of character 
which made his mild rule at Eastwood as
odious as Hilliard's stormy one had been popular.
For the rest, he was good-tempered, agreeable,
and courteous; a lover of books, moderately fond
of sport, hospitable,&mdash;an ideal country gentleman,
in short, and nearly everything which poor Leroy
Hilliard had contrived not to be,&mdash;or at least to
appear!</p>

<p>Deerford's fondness for his wife was excessive.
Her own naturally cold nature responded to this
warmth with an ardor which surprised herself.
They were, perhaps, as nearly absolutely happy as
it is given to mortals in the uncertain estate of matrimony 
to be. Deerford's business management of
Eastwood, which now included his own inherited
acres, was as admirable as had been that of his
predecessor; the plantation flourished; only an
heir to its wide fields and outlying woodlands was
wanting. This was a source of keen regret both
to husband and wife,&mdash;the one flaw in the clear
crystal of their wedded lives. But even this did
not disturb the tranquil years which drifted over

<!-- page 19 -->

fair Eastwood mansion, where, except by insignificant 
little Miss Bolton, Leroy Hilliard was as
utterly forgotten as his own mutilated portrait in
the dust-strewn garret.</p>

<br/>

<p>One day in late April Mrs. Deerford was lying
on a low lounge drawn into the bay window of the
library at Eastwood. She had been three years
the wife of Francis Deerford; these years had but
given an added grace to her beauty; their unbroken 
sunshine seemed to have brightened the
glory of her hair and ripened the red of her perfect 
lips. At the moment, however, she was
slightly pale, and an unusual languor pervaded
the graceful white-clad form nestling amid the
embroidered cushions. The window-blinds were
drawn, for the noon sun was hot, but the sash was
open, and the perfume of damask roses mingled
with honeysuckle floated in on the river breeze,
which stirred the muslin curtains. The lounger
reached out a slender hand and turned the slats of
the jalousied blind.</p>

<p>"The smell of the honeysuckle makes me ill,"
she said a little fretfully, moving her head nervously 
from side to side.</p>

<p>Aunt Pauline, darker and more withered and
shrunken than ever, looked up from her tambour-frame. 
"I like the smell of honeysuckle, myself,"
she said absently. "Your mother and I used to
wear it in our hair"&mdash;she stopped suddenly,
aware of having expressed an individual opinion.

"I&mdash;I mean&mdash;I heard a boat whistle at the boat-landing 
about an hour ago, Lilla," she added,
irrelevantly.</p>

<p>"So did I," returned Mrs. Deerford. "It
screeched like a demon. I believe that is what
gave me this splitting headache."</p>

<p>"Poor darling! Can I do anything for you,
Lilla?" asked Miss Bolton timidly.</p>

<p>"No." The monosyllable was decisive and unmistakably 
cross. Aunt Pauline bent her head
again over the woolen roses she was stitching into
canvas. Her niece clasped her hands above her
head and stared up at the ceiling with wide-open
eyes; their blue was intensified by heavy purple
half-moons beneath them; there was a drawn look
about the corners of her mouth.</p>

<p>"She is really ill," thought Miss Bolton, glancing 
furtively at her. "I never saw her ill before.
What shall I do? Oh, what shall I do!"</p>

<p>Her alarmed meditations were interrupted by a
sound which sent an unaccountable shock through
her own small body. The sound in itself was ordinary 
enough,&mdash;the galloping beat of a horse's
hoofs on the hard road which led past the lawn
gates. These hoof-beats echoed loudly on the still
air; then, growing fainter in the distance, died at
length into silence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Deerford sat up, pressing her hand to her
heart, her ear straining toward the closed window,
her startled eyes fixed upon her aunt, who stared
wildly back at her.</p>

<!-- page 21 -->

<p>"It sounded like&mdash;I thought it was"&mdash;stammered 
the older woman, after a long pause, trembling 
still from some inner excitement.</p>

<p>Mrs. Deerford sank wearily back among her
cushions. "How perfectly ridiculous you are with
your fancies, Aunt Pauline," she said, closing her
eyes to prevent further conversation.</p>

<p>Deerford at the same time was riding about his
fields,&mdash;his regular morning occupation,&mdash;inspecting 
work, overlooking improvements, directing 
important operations. He had grown somewhat 
stouter, and sat his easy-going, well-groomed
horse with the careless slouch of a man who lives
much in the saddle, but does no hard riding. The
growing cane, rustling in the breeze, allowed a far-reaching 
view of the level fields with the dividing
ditches, where the springing weeds marked the
symmetrical squares with a fringe of darker green.
Gangs of laborers were at work among the cane-rows; 
the dark blue blouses of the men and the
gaudy turbans of the women made bright spots of
color in the landscape. The roof of the plantation-house, 
with its great dormer windows, and a
glimpse of the pillared galleries below, showed in
the distance amid sheltering trees. The planter's
eyes roved over the scene with satisfaction, fixing
themselves at length on the tall sugar-house chimneys 
under the horizon, red and massive against
the noon sky. "I must send over to the landing
for that new boiler. I heard the boat whistle
some time ago," he mused, touching his horse's

<!-- page 22 -->

flank lightly with his spur. A grove of pecan-trees 
jutting out from a bit of uncleared woodland
made a sharp curve in the road before him. As
he turned the curve he came face to face with
Leroy Hilliard.</p>

<p>Hilliard, who had been called out from Carolina
on important business, which related solely to
his own affairs, had calculated the possibility of
encountering Deerford, when, in order to save
valuable time, he had taken the short cut across
Eastwood plantation, from the boat-landing to
St. Denis. He was therefore prepared for the
momentary meeting. His face preserved its impassiveness 
as he thundered past on a huge black
horse which was glistening with foam. A single
glance, an almost imperceptible inclination of the
head,&mdash;the instinctive courtesy of the well-bred
man,&mdash;and he had swept out of sight.</p>

<p>Deerford reined back his horse with a grip
which threw the animal on his haunches. When
Hilliard had disappeared, he sat for a moment
with his hands resting on the high pommel of his
saddle like one suddenly turned to stone. Then
recovering himself with an effort, he rode on to
the house. Had his wife been quite well, she
could not but have remarked his unwonted agitation. 
He found her lying on the lounge in the
library, alone; for, at his approach, Miss Bolton
had fled to her own room. There, kneeling by
her bed, she was weeping the gentle tears of age,
and praying for the welfare of him whose image

<!-- page 23 -->

had arisen mysteriously, but with startling vividness, 
on her mind.</p>

<p>Deerford did not mention Hilliard's reappearance. 
And neither then, nor at any time of her
life, did his wife know that the incarnation of her
wretched past had galloped in bodily form before
her gates.</p>

<p>Hilliard indeed remained but a few hours in the
vicinity. He returned by a more circuitous route
to the landing, and left the same afternoon for the
city.</p>

<p>"He come like a comic, Marse Roy did," black
Jerry afterward remarked wistfully, "an' he went
like a comic. But he is jes' de same! He ain'
tu'n a hair."</p>

<p>Even Deerford had had time in their brief meeting 
to note that the hated face was unchanged; or
rather that the slight lines of care had vanished;
and the cheeks, awhile back swollen by dissipation,
had regained their healthy glow.</p>

<br/>

<p>In January of the following year there was
extraordinary rejoicing in the stately home so long
echoless of childish voices. An heir was born,&mdash;a 
sturdy, strong-limbed boy, whose first cry pierced
the stillness of the house like a shrill trumpet-call.</p>

<p>Mr. Deerford's overseer, by the master's order,
proclaimed a general holiday for the plantation
negroes; and Mr. Deerford himself, standing on
the veranda, announced the name of his first-born
to the throng of house-servants and field-hands

<!-- page 24 -->

assembled in the yard below,&mdash;<i>Francis Armstead
Deerford</i>. A distribution of small gifts and generous 
drinks at the quarters further commemorated 
the joyous event.</p>

<p>Within the house, Mrs. Deerford was gazing
eagerly at the small head lying for the first time
in the hollow of her arm. The light from a blazing 
wood fire in the fireplace played over her own
fair locks, deepening their sheen, and touched the
curiously thick curls on the new-born infant's
head.</p>

<p>"Why, he has black hair!" she suddenly exclaimed, 
with a movement of distaste.</p>

<p>"So he has," said Aunt Pauline, hovering over
him. "So he has. He will take after your mother's 
family. We are all black-haired. At
least, my dear," she added quickly, seeing that
she had managed as usual to say the wrong thing,
"I mean&mdash;his hair is black now, but it will
change, of course. A baby's hair is always black.
But it will be blond. Oh, of course."</p>

<p>"Do you think it will? Are you sure?" appealed 
Lilla, with unusual gentleness in her voice.</p>

<p>Some days later, she called her nurse. "Look,
Maum Dicy," she said, "what is this?" She
traced with her slender forefinger the thin red
mark across the boy's soft cheek.</p>

<p>"Dat?" sniffed the experienced nurse. "Dat
ain't no more'n a wrinkle, Mis' Lilla. Don't you
be frettin' 'bout dat. It'll smoove out, by time
lil Marse Francis is got his eyes fair open."</p>

<!-- page 25 -->

<p>But the child's hair did not change its color,
and the thin scarlet line on the left cheek did not
smooth out. The dark curls grew darker, as the
tender skin whitened and the baby features lost
their first look of vacuity. The small jaw squared
itself; the brow broadened; a pair of soft brown
eyes looked out from beneath long black curling
lashes. And, slantwise across the left cheek, the
slender line showed itself like a lightning streak,
when Francis Armstead Deerford became angry.
And angry he often was, though for the most part
a lovable, cooing, dimpled bit of humanity.</p>

<p>No one noticed it for a time, or no one seemed
to notice it,&mdash;the strange likeness of the young
heir of Eastwood to Leroy Hilliard. Doubtless the
servants&mdash;those lynx-eyed despots whose presence
we ignore, and who hold us in the hollow of their
hands&mdash;saw it earlier, and seeing it, discussed it
among themselves.</p>

<p>But the boy was wearing his first short frock,
and standing by a chair alone, with his mother
hovering near, with anxious outspread arms, the
day Mrs. Deerford first remarked her son's startling 
resemblance to the man so long banished from
her life. The thing came upon her without warning, 
and like a lightning-shock. They were all
assembled in the library. Deerford leaned against
a corner of the mantel, his eyes fixed with a brooding 
gaze upon his wife's laughing face. Miss
Bolton sat on the edge of a sofa watching the child
and trembling with suppressed joy. The September 

<!-- page 26 -->

sunlight, streaming in at the open windows,
enveloped his rosy little body with warm radiance.
A hummingbird darting in through the lattice-work 
of honeysuckle vines circled on iridescent
wing above him. He threw back his head, opening 
wide his tawny eyes, and laughed,&mdash;a low,
musical laugh which sounded like a far-away echo
of the laughter which had once filled the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Deerford started and turned instinctively
to her husband. A flash of sudden and painful
recognition leaped from one pair of blue eyes to
the other. Deerford flushed, turned on his heel,
and left the room without a word. Miss Bolton
sprang forward and caught Francis, who had loosed
his grasp on the chair and was tottering uncertainly 
on his sturdy little legs. And seeing the
mother absorbed in thought and apparently oblivious 
for once of the child's presence, she bore her
treasure away to her own room, for there was a
strange, almost pathetic tie between lonely Aunt
Pauline and the dark-haired boy of Eastwood.
He rewarded her furtively displayed adoration with
a defiant challenging affection, which amused strangers, 
but hitherto had secretly irritated his mother;
he rarely showed in her presence those bursts of
anger which touched into color the birth-mark on
his cheek. His first attempt at speech had been
her name. He clung to her now, patting her withered 
neck and cooing softly: "Pau-yeen! Pau-yeen!"</p>

<p>Meantime, Mrs. Deerford remained as if rooted

<!-- page 27 -->

to the spot where she had stood when the revelation 
came to her. Her pale lips framed silently
and over and over the question "What does it
mean? What can it mean?"</p>

<p>She asked herself the question so often during
the next two years that she sometimes felt as if
she were mad. She watched the growing child
with a sort of terror; the brown yellow-glinted
eyes and the masterful streaked face fascinated
and repulsed her. The mother-love within her
wrestled with something almost akin to hatred for
this monstrous alien who had stolen unawares into
her life. At times, when the boy was out of her
sight, she persuaded herself that the hideous likeness 
existed only in her excited imagination; but
with his presence the conviction returned, each
time with more telling force. She studied her
husband furtively and incessantly; and she could
not long blind herself to the fact that he had ceased
to show either love for the son or pride in the heir
so eagerly welcomed. She found herself breathlessly 
planning and contriving to keep the child
out of his father's sight, as if the little creature
were some accursed thing.</p>

<p>Deerford's affection for herself, however, showed
no diminution; and when, a year after the birth
of young Francis, a second son came to them, he
lavished upon the blond babe&mdash;a blended image
of himself and Lilla&mdash;a wealth of tenderness well
nigh delirious in its intensity.</p>

<p>One day the two boys were at play in the nursery. 

<!-- page 28 -->

Francis was then about three years and a
half old,&mdash;a beautiful, bold, and defiant little
being, already aware by some subtle instinct that
his brother Allan was preferred before him. He
looked up at his mother, who was watching them,
from under drawn, sullen brows. The look made
her shudder; she remembered it so well! "Am I
torturing myself needlessly," she exclaimed inwardly, 
"or is the likeness really there!" Even
as the thought flashed through her brain Francis
stooped, and in pure wantonness set his white teeth
savagely in Allan's bare shoulder. Mrs. Deerford
snatched the screaming child to her breast with
a cry; and in a transport of rage struck the aggressor 
furiously upon the mouth. Then ashamed
and terrified, she fled from his uplifted silent questioning 
face, leaving the brothers together.</p>

<p>An hour later, she paused in her long monotonous 
walk up and down the front veranda; she
stood a moment in uncertain thought, then she
mounted the stairs again to the nursery. The
nurse was sewing by the window; Allan lay sleeping 
quietly in his crib bed, his yellow curls flowing
over the pillow. Francis sat on the floor playing
with some tin soldiers. He looked up as his mother 
entered. The scarlet line on his cheek had
faded to its normal dull pink color; his large eyes
were soft and tranquil.</p>

<p>"Come, Francis," Mrs. Deerford ordered authoritatively, 
holding out her hand.</p>

<p>He regarded her in grave silence, but did not
move.</p>

<!-- page 29 -->

<p>"Come with mother, Francis," she continued in
a coaxing tone. He got up instantly and placed
his small brown fist in her white palm.</p>

<p>She led him down the long hall and opened a
closed door near the end. She hesitated a moment
before the short flight of steps within; then ascended 
rapidly, drawing the child after her. He
toiled up, planting first one foot and then the
other upon each step. "Don't yun so fas', muzzer," 
he cried at length, frowning up at her. She
looked down at him with unseeing eyes and hastened 
on.</p>

<p>The garret at the head of the stairway was one
long room, whose low unceiled roof almost touched
the intruder's head. It contained a heterogeneous
mass of rubbish,&mdash;the accumulated un-throwawayable 
stuff of several generations of Armsteads.
It took Mrs. Deerford some time&mdash;stepping
about in the dust unmindful of her trailing gown&mdash;to 
find what she wanted. Francis seized upon
an ancient rocking-horse, shouting with delight as
he dragged it about.</p>

<p>Finally, Lilla came upon the portrait; it was
lying face downward upon a huge packing-box.
She lifted it and set it upon the floor, leaning it
against the wall where the light from the low
attic window fell full upon it. The gilt frame
was tarnished, the pictured face was obscured by
dust and cobwebs. She brushed these off carefully
with her handkerchief, then sank on her knees in
front of it.</p>

<!-- page 30 -->

<p>"Francis!" She turned to beckon the boy to
her, but he had already approached quietly and
was standing unbidden at her elbow. She drew
him with her arm and gazed long and searchingly
from Leroy's dark visage, with the disfiguring cut
across it, made by her own hand, to the blooming
young face, marred only by its birth-mark, resting
against her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Pitty man! Pitty man!" lisped the boy,
touching the portrait with the tips of his fingers.</p>

<p>"It is true! Oh, it is cruelly true! God help
me!" moaned the kneeling woman, with a sob in
her throat.</p>

<p>The unconscious pressure of her arm hurt and
angered the child. He faced her, scowling, the
red line leaping, as it were, into vividness on his
cheek.</p>

<p>At that moment a slight noise disturbed the
stillness of the room. Mrs. Deerford looked up.
Her husband was standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Lilla?" There was an agonized question in
his voice as he came slowly forward.</p>

<p>"Oh, I hated him, Francis! I loathed him!"
she cried, answering the unspoken question. "I
loathe his memory! But&mdash;oh&mdash;you see!" she
sobbed hysterically with her face on his breast,
"the child&mdash;the child!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see. I have known from the first&mdash;almost," 
he replied gravely. He seemed about to
say more, but checked himself, and drew her away
with soothing words and tender caresses. They

<!-- page 31 -->

passed arm in arm down the stair, leaving the
child alone and forgotten in the dusty garret. An
hour later Aunt Pauline found him there. He
was sitting before Hilliard's portrait, babbling to
it with the innocent confidence of babyhood.</p>

<hr/>

<p>III</p>

<p class="small">CAST OUT OF THE NEST</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Within</span> the next six months, Deerford effected
the sale of Eastwood and all its belongings, including 
the negroes, with the exception of a few of
the house-servants. This unexpected transaction
caused considerable comment, but Deerford was
known to be a shrewd business man, and many of
his friends afterward gave him credit for a discernment 
which he did not possess. In reality, he
noted no more than the planters around him the
gathering clouds which preceded the storm of the
Civil War. He was actuated solely by a dread&mdash;shared 
by his wife, though in secret, for the
matter was never openly discussed between them&mdash;lest 
his older son's extraordinary resemblance to
Leroy Hilliard should, in the course of time, become 
a subject of comment. So far, the nursery
walls had effectually barred neighborhood gossip.
But when nursery days should be over, what then?
"I dare not risk it," Deerford concluded, appalled
at the thought.</p>

<p>He left Eastwood with his family as soon as
possible after the transaction was concluded which
gave the old Armstead plantation a new owner.

<!-- page 33 -->

The birth of a daughter&mdash;a miniature copy of
the still beautiful mother&mdash;celebrated their installment 
into their newly purchased home,&mdash;a
handsome house with ample grounds, situated near
a rural town in the State of Kentucky.</p>

<p>The sense of restraint which had long oppressed
the husband and wife passed suddenly. Even
the black-haired alien seemed to have lost the
power to disturb the tranquil atmosphere of the
new home. Unloved, rarely noticed, except by
Aunt Pauline, he was at least no longer a menace;
and his presence in the household was suffered, his
physical needs, as always, scrupulously supplied.</p>

<p>The tempest was over; the skies so long overshadowed 
were once more clear and sunny!</p>

<p>Deerford occupied himself with the final settlement 
of his affairs and the investment of his
money, finding himself a very rich man, and gave
as yet a rather careless attention to the rapid
course of events which were hurrying on the inevitable 
conflict between the States.</p>

<p>The summer of '61 had set in. The fall of
Fort Sumter and the excitement which followed
had sent a thrill of excitement through the little
town near which the Deerfords had settled. Deerford 
himself drove or rode in daily to hear the
latest news concerning the gathering armies. One
afternoon he returned home, bringing with him a
guest,&mdash;a Mr. Richard Allington, an elderly man
who had known Lilla's father, and who had visited
Eastwood both before and after her marriage with

<!-- page 34 -->

Hilliard. He had, it appeared, been living for
some years in England, but had hurried over to
look after some property, unsafe, perhaps, in the
event of war. He was genial and talkative; the
early country dinner was prolonged far beyond
the usual sitting; the red slanting rays of a setting 
sun flooded the great gallery as he came out
with his hosts, all in unwontedly joyous mood,
and stood looking about him.</p>

<p>"Fine children, Mrs. Deerford," he observed
heartily. "Uncommonly fine children." He
glanced at the group assembled on the lawn in
front of the steps. Mabel, the baby girl, sat on
the nurse's knee; Francis, with his arm about her
and his black locks touching her blond curls, had
his eyes fixed in an ecstasy of childish admiration
upon his younger brother Allan. Little Allan,
clad in a single light garment that left his arms
and his rosy little legs bare, was dancing to the
music of a mouth-harp played by a negro boy. A
wreath of blood-red roses crowned his fair hair.
He swayed to and fro, throwing out his small
hands and tossing his head with the grace and
abandon of a young fawn.</p>

<p>"A beautiful child," said Mr. Allington, watching 
him, "and very like his mother. Your older
son, madam," continued the old gentleman amiably, 
"resembles his father remarkably, re-markably. 
I knew Hilliard quite well. Fine fellow he
was, too. Pity he died," he added reflectively
and quite unconsciously.</p>

<!-- page 35 -->

<p>Mrs. Deerford flushed painfully. Deerford
made a casual remark, which changed the current
of his guest's rambling talk.</p>

<p>It is but fair to record that Mr. Richard Allington, 
learning later the facts of the case, was so
shocked at his own indiscretion that he took to his
bed and came near dying.</p>

<br/>

<p>"Lilla," said Deerford, entering his wife's dressing-room 
a week later. Something in his tone
caused her to look up hastily. He held an open
letter in his hand. He did not glance at her as
he proceeded. "I have here a letter from my
cousin Mary, Mrs. Wright. You will no doubt
remember that she has lived for some years in New
York city. She has no children of her own. She
is now a widow, and she has consented"&mdash;he
paused a second to clear his throat and went on
hurriedly&mdash;"consented to take Francis for&mdash;for
a while. I wrote her that the boy was high-tempered 
and unmanageable, and that I&mdash;we&mdash;wished 
to remove him for a time from association
with my&mdash;with the other children. You will understand, 
my dear," his hard voice softened a
little, but immediately hardened again, "that this
is only a temporary arrangement, and that you
can see the&mdash;the child at any time you may desire.
I shall take him myself to New York. I will start
to-morrow, if you will have him ready. It is for
the best," he concluded, looking his wife full in
the face for the first time.</p>

<!-- page 36 -->

<p>"Yes&mdash;it&mdash;is&mdash;for&mdash;the&mdash;best," she gasped.
She watched him go out and close the door behind
him. Then she arose and walked about the small
room, the prey to feelings so intermingled that she
could not herself understand or analyze them.
She was conscious of a deep pang of self-reproach
as a small face rose before her inner vision, and
a pair of soft eyes looked wistfully at her. She
was at the same time horribly conscious of a wave
of relief, immense, inexpressible, which surged
over her.</p>

<p>The next day, when the carriage which bore her
first-born into exile left the gates, she wept bitterly. 
She leaned from an upper window and
watched it as long as she could see it whirling
along the turnpike road. But when it was quite
out of sight, she looked down at Allan and Mabel
playing on the shaded lawn below, and drew a
long breath. She felt, in spite of herself, as if
a chain which had bound her chest had snapped
asunder, leaving her heart liberty to beat. Then
she cowered to the floor and lay there prone, like
a guilty thing.</p>

<p>It was Aunt Pauline, bewildered by this inexplicable 
step, and who, strange to say, had been
blind to the boy's mysterious resemblance to Hilliard, 
who truly mourned and truly wept.</p>

<p>Deerford, in the railway coach, saw to the boy's
wants, but otherwise paid as little attention to
him as possible; he sat in a corner of the seat
brooding gloomily, and hardly glancing out of

<!-- page 37 -->

the window at the signs of excitement everywhere
visible.</p>

<p>Tents were gleaming white, here and there,
under the horizon; a strange flag was flying from
buildings in the towns; raw recruits were crowding
the platforms at the stations; soldierly-looking men
got off and on the train; boys, passing along the
aisles of the coaches, were selling newspapers with
startling head-lines; the battle of Bull Run had
just been fought.</p>

<p>Deerford looked at last with feverish eyes at a
paper he held in his hand. "When I am free,"
he muttered; he looked at the little boy, who was
kneeling upon the seat opposite, staring with all
his might out of the window, "when this weight
is off my mind, I will have time to think. The
burden of the last ten days has been more than
I could bear." He groaned aloud.</p>

<p>Suddenly his form straightened as if by an inner
spring. A paragraph in the column of dispatches
had arrested his attention. It was dated at Richmond, 
Virginia, and read thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Captain Leroy Hilliard has received his commission 
as Colonel of the &mdash;&mdash;th Regiment of South
Carolina Volunteers. Colonel Hilliard, who has
raised and equipped this regiment largely at his
own personal expense, is at present at B&mdash;&mdash;, his
old home, near which his men are encamped. He
expects to receive marching orders within the
week."</p>

<p>Deerford dropped the paper and remained for

<!-- page 38 -->

some time lost in deep thought. He roused himself 
with a sigh to examine a railway guide.
Later, he had a consultation with the conductor,
and some time during the same night he quitted
the train, carrying the sleeping child in his arms.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 39 -->

<div class="center" id="ch04">

<p>IV</p>

<p class="small">FACE TO FACE</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel Leroy Hilliard's</span> office, pending
the enlistment and organization of his regiment,
was in a small room, formerly sacred to the women-folk 
in the old Hilliard mansion at B&mdash;&mdash;. Certain
tokens of femininity still lingered there, but the
pile of official documents on the small desk, the
maps unrolled upon the table, the silk flag tossed
carelessly over the back of a chair, the sword and
sash which Hilliard himself had just taken off and
placed on the low mantel,&mdash;all this gave a look
of business&mdash;and disorder&mdash;to the ancient boudoir, 
of which the originals of the portraits on the
walls (slim ladies with short waists and looped-up
curls) would certainly have disapproved. But
there was no woman at hand to resent the disarray
or question the intrusion of business into her territory. 
Hilliard dwelt alone, with his retinue of
servants, in the old house. His mother had long
been dead, and his only sister was married and
lived in another part of the town.</p>

<p>The summer night was warm, and the master of
the house opened the window-blinds to the faint
breeze, before taking his seat. The only other

<!-- page 40 -->

occupant of the room, a tall gray-haired old man
with a benignant face and keen deep-sunken eyes,
who sat on a lounge, smoking, looked at the
newly appointed colonel with frank admiration.
Hilliard was now in the prime of manhood. His
thick hair and drooping mustaches were slightly
powdered with gray, the furrow on his forehead
had deepened, there were lines about his mouth
which gave it a look of sternness. But his figure
was lithe and erect in his close-fitting gray uniform, 
a youthful color came and went in his cheeks,
his brown eyes retained their winning softness.</p>

<p>"You are a good-looking young dog, Roy," said
Doctor Greaves earnestly, taking his pipe from
his mouth.</p>

<p>"A dog, and good-looking, I grant you, Doctor," 
returned Hilliard, laughing, "but, alas, no
longer young!"</p>

<p>"Oh, to an old fellow like me"&mdash;the doctor
shrugged his shoulders and leaned back among the
cushions, leaving the sentence unfinished. Hilliard 
drew up a chair and sat down.</p>

<p>"When do you leave?" the older man asked,
with a quick return to seriousness.</p>

<p>"I am expecting orders from the War Department 
at any moment. Impatiently, I confess.
The regiment is fully equipped and in fine condition, 
but the men are growing restless under their
enforced inactivity. They&mdash;I may say we&mdash;are
anxious to get into the thick of things."</p>

<p>"They will not 'hanker' so ardently by this

<!-- page 41 -->

time next year." Doctor Greaves smiled as he
made this prophecy.</p>

<p>"This time next year!" echoed Hilliard. "You
confounded old croaker! we shall have wiped the
Yankees out of existence and got back to our
plough-handles inside of six months."</p>

<p>Doctor Greaves shook his head.</p>

<p>"But look at Bull Run, Doc," argued his companion 
excitedly. "And it stands to reason, with
such a beginning when our troops are raw and
inexperienced, that when they are fairly drilled
and disciplined we shall be able to make quick
work of bringing the weak-kneed North to terms."</p>

<p>The old man's heart stirred at the ring of boyish 
enthusiasm in the speaker's voice.</p>

<p>"My dear Roy," he said, laying his hand impressively 
on the gray-clad shoulder, "never undervalue 
your foe, and particularly in this instance. 
You are fighting, God save us! against
men of your own race, your own blood, your own
temper&mdash;your very brothers! Does it stand to
reason, as you say, that an imaginary line drawn
across this great country from east to west will
leave all the brave men on the one side of it, and
all the cowards on the other? No, no! The
common ancestry who gave to the one section
tough fibre and hot blood has been no less liberal
to the other, you may depend upon it. Prepare
yourself for a stubborn and bloody conflict. I see,
with the eyes of age, dim as they are, many things
which are hidden from yours by the dancing of

banners and the glitter of bare blades; I hear
ominous cries which for your ears are drowned in
the beat of the drum and the loud call of the
trumpet."</p>

<p>Hilliard listened respectfully. That he was not
convinced was evident from the remonstrant tone
in which he began, after a short pause: "But the
cause for which the South has taken up arms"&mdash;</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a low knock on the closed
door. His body-servant, a staid, middle-aged
negro man, presented himself in response to his
master's ringing "Come in."</p>

<p>"A gentleman to see you, Marse Roy," he said;
"a gentleman with a"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Very well, Robert. Show him into the library." 
Robert bowed respectfully and withdrew.
"Doubtless a courier from the camp. I will not
have him brought in here to interfere with what
may be our last evening together for a long time,
Doc; but I must see him at once."</p>

<p>He rose as he spoke, and had taken a single
step forward, when the door was thrown violently
open again, and Francis Deerford appeared on the
threshold. He carried the little boy Francis in
his arms; both father and son were travel-stained
and weary-looking. Deerford, usually so elegant
in his dress, was unkempt and unshaven. His
face was pale and distorted, his eyes were bloodshot. 
He stepped across the room and set the child
on the floor at Hilliard's feet. Then he stood back
and regarded him for a moment in silence.</p>

<!-- page 43 -->

<p>"I have brought you your child, Leroy Hilliard," 
he said, in a thick, muffled voice.</p>

<p>Hilliard stared at him, speechless with amazement. 
"What do you mean?" he demanded at
length, with a questioning frown.</p>

<p>"I have brought you your child, Leroy Hilliard," 
Deerford repeated. "Look at him! Look
at him, and deny him if you dare!"</p>

<p>Hilliard turned mechanically and gazed down
at the small face lifted wonderingly to his own.
But he literally saw nothing. A mist of rising
wrath blinded his eyes.</p>

<p>"I desire you distinctly to understand," Deerford 
went on, and something in his tone and manner 
compelled Hilliard to listen, "I desire to
impress upon you above everything that I hold my
wife absolutely blameless"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your wife!" echoed Hilliard, puzzled beyond
expression.</p>

<p>"I know my wife to be as spotlessly pure in
thought, as white and unsullied in soul, as if this
child&mdash;your child and hers! had never been born.
If she surrendered herself to your hellish passion
during my absence"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good God, Deerford!" exclaimed Hilliard,
recoiling as from a blow, "are you mad!"</p>

<p>"&mdash;she submitted to brute force alone. Of that
I am as sure as that I stand here in the presence
of a brute, and she remains as innocent in my eyes
as if her stainless body&mdash;oh, my God, my God!&mdash;had 
never been cursed with the weight of this

<!-- page 44 -->

miserable image of yourself. God knows how she
has suffered. God knows the torture I have endured 
for the past four years. Now, it is your
turn. I cannot make your heart bleed drop by
drop in agony, as hers has done. I cannot place
you upon the rack where I have lain, but I have
brought you your child, Leroy Hilliard, that you
may at least understand why you die the death of
a dog and a ravisher."</p>

<p>His voice had risen to a hoarse shriek, his lips
foamed as the torrent of words poured from them.
As he concluded, he thrust his hand into his bosom
and leaped forward; Hilliard, with a quick movement, 
caught his wrist; a pistol-shot rang sharply
on the air, and a ball, hurtling upward, buried
itself in the ceiling.</p>

<p>Hilliard's grasp on the white wrist tightened;
with the other hand twisted in the madman's collar,
he forced him backward upon his knees. There
was a gurgling sound in the throat against his
powerful knuckles.</p>

<p>"<i>Leroy!</i>" The doctor's warning grasp and
authoritative voice penetrated his frenzied senses
just in time. He loosed his hold; the kneeling
man rolled heavily to the floor, where he lay for
a second, gasping painfully. Then he got upon
his feet slowly, and stood looking about him with
dazed eyes.</p>

<p>"Go," said Hilliard sternly. "Go while you
may."</p>

<p>Deerford did not move. His pale lips parted,

<!-- page 45 -->

and a few incoherent words escaped them. His
hands wandered, trembling, over his breast, trying
mechanically to smooth his disordered garments.
There was a strange, almost pitiful droop in his
shoulders. Doctor Greaves laid a hand on his
arm, and drew him quietly from the room, and
out of the house into the front garden. There,
as if seized by some sudden impulse, he shook
himself free, and rushed precipitately into the
street, muttering as he went.</p>

<p>Hilliard had dropped upon a chair, utterly unnerved 
by Deerford's monstrous accusation and
the fierceness of his assault.</p>

<p>Little Francis had remained standing in the
middle of the room, where his father had placed
him on entering. He had cowered at the report
of the pistol, and his eyes had widened in terror
during the short struggle which followed between
the two men. But he had stood quite still, and
silent. A short sob escaped him now, as Doctor
Greaves, coming back into the room, lifted him in
his arms and placed him on the lounge.</p>

<p>"You mustn't cry, little man! Are you hungry?" 
The old doctor placed his palm under the
small square jaw and lifted the tear-stained face.</p>

<p>"No." Francis choked back his sobs bravely
and shook his head. Seeing a pleasant pair of
eyes so near his own, he smiled brightly, showing
his jagged white teeth.</p>

<p>"Thirsty, then, eh? sleepy? tired?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no; was so'gers on ee twain wif buttons 

<!-- page 46 -->

an' guns, an' shiny sings," he added confidingly. 
Poor little man! It was the first time for
three days that he had looked into a kindly face.
"I <i>yike</i> so'gers."</p>

<p>"Do you? So do I"&mdash;</p>

<p>"An' guns, an' shiny sings. I <i>wish</i> I had
some shiny sings to play wif, an' guns!" The
small head was turned on one side, and a smile,
intended to be deeply cunning, parted the red lips;
the brown eyes were fixed hungrily on the sheathed
sword, with its glittering hilt, lying upon the
mantel.</p>

<p>Doctor Greaves chuckled understandingly. He
took the sword and laid it across the little boy's
knees. "Here's your plaything, Mr. General,"
he said. "Doesn't it shine, though! And look
at the tassel! Now, mind you, keep quiet, sir,
while I talk to the soldier yonder. Understand?"</p>

<p>Francis received the sword with a cry of delight.
He hugged it to his bosom and nodded a grave
acquiescence to the old man's admonition.</p>

<p>Doctor Greaves seated himself opposite Hilliard,
and regarded him for a time in silence.</p>

<p>"Leroy," he began finally, and there was a hint
of stern reproof in his voice, "is this boy yours?"</p>

<p>Hilliard lifted his head and looked proudly into
the face of his dead father's friend. "Doctor,"
he said solemnly, "I swear to you by the memory
of my mother, that I have never even seen Lilla&mdash;Deerford's 
wife, since the day I left her, nearly
two years before she was married to another man."</p>

<!-- page 47 -->

<p>"I believe you, my boy," returned the old man
quietly, "fully and unreservedly. But tell me
of her," he continued, divining that the young
man, who was as a son to his own childless age,
was feeling&mdash;unconsciously to himself, perhaps&mdash;the 
need of open speech. "You have told me
so little of your&mdash;of that episode in your life.
Did you love her?"</p>

<p>Hilliard's laugh was a bitter one. "Love her?"
he echoed. "Yes. At least I thought I did.
She was young and beautiful; what more does a
boy of twenty-two ask in a wife! Yes," he went
on in a gentler tone, "I loved her, and I thought
she loved me. Why else should she, so sought
after, so courted and caressed, why else should
she have married me? But we were no sooner
man and wife than her love&mdash;or whatever the
feeling was which she had for me&mdash;seemed to
turn to hatred&mdash;a bitter, vindictive hatred, which
made my very presence loathsome to her. She
could not hide her horror of me,&mdash;indeed, she
did not try to do so. I will do her the justice to
say that I believe this feeling was uncontrollable.
I think I must have been, in some subtle and unreasoning 
way, physically and spiritually antipathetic 
to her. And certainly she roused in me my
worst self,&mdash;tastes and passions which hitherto
had not seemed to exist! If I had lived with her
ten years, I should doubtless have been the demon
she gave me out to be.</p>

<p>"She showed to all about her&mdash;to her father

<!-- page 48 -->

who idolized her, and to the aunt who had been a
second mother to her&mdash;a sort of careless cruelty.
But it may have been contact with me which awakened 
this, together with her furious and shuddering 
aversion for myself. Perhaps if she had
married some one else&mdash;perhaps Deerford even,
narrow and shallow as he is, may have made her&mdash;different." 
He paused and sighed heavily.
"Well, within a short time, life became unbearable 
to us both. The death of Mr. Armstead
removed all restraint. . . . I am not fond of
remembering myself as I was during those two
wretched years, Doc! But I am sorry for myself
when I do think of them! I am sorry for her! I
was sorry for her then, much as I hated her.
God, how I hated her! . . . You know how it all
ended,&mdash;nine years ago. I have never seen her
since. And except for a hurried business trip,
something over four years ago, I have never even
set foot in the State where she lives. At that
time, I had a single passing glimpse of Deerford.
He seemed prosperous and happy, riding about
his fields at Eastwood plantation. As for the
child, no one but a madman"&mdash;</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly, his gaze fixed upon the
little boy, whom he now really saw for the first
time. He flushed and then grew deadly pale.
A look of wild terror flashed into his eyes.</p>

<p>"God Almighty, Doctor," he whispered hoarsely.
"What does it mean? Am I dreaming? Am I
mad? Is he&mdash;God! the boy is my image."</p>

<!-- page 49 -->

<p>"Yes," returned the doctor in a low voice.
"He is marvelously like you; but listen, Roy,
listen, man,"&mdash;for Hilliard's excitement was becoming 
painful. "It is a well-known fact," he
continued impressively, "and remember, I speak
professionally,&mdash;it is an established fact that the
children of a second marriage sometimes resemble
the first husband,&mdash;particularly if the woman at
the time of the first union was young. I have
myself known of one such instance before, though
far less pronounced than this. In this case, it
may be explained by the powerful impression you
undoubtedly made upon the mind of your wife.
That you were repulsive to her would seem only
to have intensified the result."</p>

<p>"Can this be true?" murmured Hilliard, rising
and walking about the room, deeply agitated. "It
must be. It is the only possible, the only conceivable 
solution. Poor Deerford, how he must
have suffered!"</p>

<p>"How his wife must have suffered, if she saw
the resemblance. And if she realized his suspicions."</p>

<p>Hilliard shrugged his shoulders. "Perhaps,"
he admitted. "Poor Deerford, poor devil! I
wish he could know," he said, pausing in his restless 
walk and looking at the small Deerford, busy
with the hilt of the sword.</p>

<p>"He would not believe it&mdash;in his present condition 
of mind, at least. He is as nearly insane
as a man well can be who has not actually crossed

<!-- page 50 -->

over the invisible border into the debatable land.
And you must be careful, Roy. I think he may
again try to do you bodily harm."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not afraid of him," the younger man
returned, with his eyes still on the boy.</p>

<p>"Shall you return the child to his mother? I
think it would hardly be safe to trust him in the
hands of yonder madman now. Or shall you keep
him yourself, for the present? But don't answer
me. Think it out for yourself, Roy. Only remember 
that I am at your service, in this as in all
other matters, life and death."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Doctor," returned Hilliard, grasping 
the outstretched hand closely. "I do not
know. I shall probably send him back to her at
Eastwood. In any case, I will ask you not to
speak of what has occurred here to-night."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," replied the doctor, turning;
but he lingered. There was a wistful look in his
eyes, which his companion interpreted and answered 
gravely. "Don't be afraid, Doc. The
chap is safe enough with me. Poor little outcast!"</p>

<p>Upon this, with another affectionate handshake,
Doctor Greaves withdrew.</p>

<p>Hilliard re-seated himself. The room had become 
very quiet. The occasional tramp of passing
feet on the street outside had ceased. The bugle
in the distant camp had sounded taps more than
an hour before,&mdash;the clear call winding shrilly
out on the night air. The night-blooming jessamine 

<!-- page 51 -->

in the garden sent its heavy, sickening perfume 
through the uncurtained windows; it reminded 
the man sitting, with his head bowed to
his breast, of those long-ago summer nights at
Eastwood; he moved his head angrily.</p>

<p>Little Francis, wearied at last of his coveted
plaything, had been sitting bolt upright on the
sofa, with his feet dangling over the edge, listening 
soberly to the talk between the two men. He
was used to being unnoticed; he was not surprised
when Doctor Greaves passed out of the room without 
remarking his outstretched arms, or responding
to his whispered appeal. He waited a very long
time, or so it seemed to him. Then he slipped
from his perch and pattered across the bare floor
to where the officer sat, brave with brass buttons,
and slipped his small hand into the large one,
lying palm upward on the arm of the chair.</p>

<p>"Is you my fa-zer, <i>now?</i>" he demanded with
infinite solemnity.</p>

<p>"No," said Hilliard roughly, shaking off the
rose-leaf touch. Francis turned away without a
word, too used to harsh treatment to insist. He
went back to the sofa, his shoe-lace dragging on
the floor as he went. He was beginning to be
sleepy in spite of the long afternoon nap in the
railway-car, and hungry in spite of a hearty supper. 
And he was very tired. He climbed up
among the cushions again. Great tears rolled
down his cheeks, making furrows in the grime
and dust there. He was a forlorn little figure in

<!-- page 52 -->

his soiled and crumpled kilts, with his head drooping, 
and his tousled black locks falling over his
forehead. His shoulders shook convulsively, but
he made no sound.</p>

<p>A wave of pity surged over Hilliard. It was
followed by a sudden resolution. "Leroy Hilliard," 
he called peremptorily, "come here."</p>

<p>Francis looked at him with a puzzled air; but
his face brightened; his sobs ceased instantly; he
clambered down and came once more to Hilliard's
knee.</p>

<p>"I name Fwancis," he volunteered, looking up.</p>

<p>"Your name is Leroy Hilliard," said Hilliard
sternly, "and I am your father&mdash;now."</p>

<p>"I name 'Lewoy Hi'yar,' " repeated the child,
"an' you my fa-zer&mdash;now."</p>

<p>A formal handshake, as between man and man,
ratified this compact. Hilliard lifted the other
contracting party to his knee.</p>

<p>"I love my fa-zer&mdash;now." The murmur was
scarcely audible; the tumbled head fell against
his arm, the weary eyelids closed, and the long
regular breathing announced the sound sleep of
childhood.</p>

<p>"Poor little mite," mused the self-adopted father 
with an involuntary groan. "By some wild
and unaccountable freak of nature you have inherited 
my outer semblance. To whose soul are
you heir? To Lilla's,&mdash;selfish, vain, and cruel?
Deerford's,&mdash;narrow, suspicious, and crafty? To
mine? God help you in any case, my little lad!"</p>

<!-- page 53 -->

<p>He reached out a hand and touched the bell
upon the table. Robert answered the call. "Send
Martha to me," ordered the master briefly. In a
few moments the man reappeared, accompanied
by his wife, a negro woman, quiet and staid like
her husband, and with a pleasant motherly face.
She courtesied quietly, and stood in a waiting attitude, 
showing no surprise, however much she may
have felt.</p>

<p>"Martha," her master said, with an attempt at
a smile, "this young gentleman is Leroy Hilliard,
Junior. You will give up your other duties and
look after him&mdash;after my son&mdash;from this time on."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Martha.</p>

<p>"I will probably send him to my sister's to-morrow, 
as I shall be leaving here very soon. He
will stay there during my absence. You will accompany 
him and remain with him. Put him to
bed now. The poor little fellow has traveled a
long way. He is worn out."</p>

<p>He laid the sleeping child in Martha's welcoming 
arms.</p>

<p>"Lawd, <i>ain't</i> he a sugar-man! An' de very
spit o' you, Marse Roy!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"His&mdash;his mother was my wife," Hilliard said
hastily. His face reddened. He stooped and
kissed the boy's moist pouting lips, and an inexplicable 
lump rose to his throat.</p>

<p>Left alone at last, he turned with characteristic
energy to his official reports. An hour passed,
broken only by the scratching of his pen over the

<!-- page 54 -->

paper. Suddenly he lifted his head. His keen
ear had caught the sound of a footstep on the
graveled walk which led across the wide old garden
to the house. He rose, bracing himself for another&mdash;perhaps 
a fatal encounter with Deerford.
Happily he was mistaken. The late-comer, for
the hands on the clock pointed to twelve, proved
to be a courier bringing the long-expected marching 
orders.</p>

<p>He wrote a hasty note to his sister, confiding
his adopted son to her care, and gave concise but
explicit instructions to his servants respecting the
management of his house during his absence.</p>

<p>He then threw himself upon the horse already
saddled and at the gate, and galloped out to where
his regiment was encamped half a mile away, followed 
by his body-servant.</p>

<p>There, his orderly having preceded him, everything 
was in disciplined confusion; the tents were
already down, wagons were rumbling into the open
road, the men were falling into line, and one hour
later, by the light of the summer stars, the &mdash;&mdash;th
South Carolina Volunteers matched with their
colonel toward the front.</p>

<hr/>

<p>V</p>

<p class="small">HIS CHANCE</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel Hilliard</span> saw his adopted son but
twice after that July night when the child had
been so unceremoniously thrust into his life. The
rapid and exciting progress of the Civil War left
him little time for private affairs, and his two
visits to B&mdash;&mdash; were made at long intervals; they
were also very brief, but they served to fix him
forever in the boy's mind,&mdash;a splendid image,
which neither time nor distance could dim, nor
death efface.</p>

<p>All recollection of his past, however, people,
places, and things, gradually faded from the consciousness 
of the little transplanted Deerford child.
Aunt Pauline, with her dark, sad, loving eyes,
lingered longest of all; and with her a swaying
rose-vine full of blood-red roses that seemed to
climb up to the sky on a beautiful white fluted
column. This last was doubtless a fragment of
his once-unquestioned patrimony clinging to the
memory of the once-unquestioned heir of Eastwood. 
Finally these also passed, and Leroy Hilliard, 
Junior, as he was named from the moment
of his new life's beginning, grew and thrived in

<!-- page 56 -->

the quaint Hilliard mansion set in the midst of its
century old garden. For Mrs. Blackmore, Colonel 
Hilliard's only sister, widowed early in the
struggle between the States, had returned to the
home of her childhood. She drew an arm of love
around the cast-out Deerford, as around her own
numerous brood. Tears often filled her motherly
eyes, in the earlier days, when she saw the wondering 
look on the uplifted face of the young
stranger, and the slow, incredulous curl of the
baby lips at some proffered mark of affection,&mdash;a 
smile of invitation, an approving word, a tender
caress.</p>

<p>"He ain't been use' to Hilliard treatments,
certain an' sho', Mis' Mandy," old Martha once
observed to her mistress, with a wise shake of her
turbaned head. "Look like he everlastin' feared
somebody goin' to slap him."</p>

<p>With more unrestrained candor, she said to her
husband, "I ain't sayin' a blessed thing ag'ins' the
dead, Robert, but Marse Leroy's wife must ha'
been a limb o' Satan! The chile fair shrivels up
when you ax him about his ma!"</p>

<p>The warping, fortunately, had not gone deep
enough for ruin. The atmosphere of love and
confidence soon did its work. In it the little creature 
expanded like a flower; he ceased to shrink
before an outstretched hand; he grew less wayward, 
day by day; the line on his cheek rarely
deepened to scarlet,&mdash;sign of anger or impatience; 
he became, in short, a normal, healthy
human being.</p>

<!-- page 57 -->

<p>"Your little Roy is a charming child," Mrs.
Blackmore wrote to her brother. "He lords it over
his cousins, my children, like a true Hilliard.
But since they are <i>only girls</i>, like a true Hilliard
still, he coddles them, and protects them, and
stands between them and danger (of the gander in
the kitchen-yard, and marvelous, imagined monsters 
in the rose-garden)! Of course they all worship 
him, as most women, big and little, are fated
to worship every (male) Hilliard who dawns on
their horizon. Jesting aside, my dear Roy, he is
a fine boy, and a great comfort to me already.
Pray God he may prove so to you. It is touching
to note his admiration and adoration of you. He
will stand for hours with his chubby elbows resting
on the table, staring at your photograph; the
merest mention of your name brings him running
to my knee; his choicest plaything is one of your
old belts. The only time that inexplicable mark
has reddened his face for months was a day or
two since, when he found one of his playmates&mdash;a 
visitor&mdash;buckling this belt around him!"</p>

<p>This letter, written soon after Hilliard's second
visit to his old home, and just before the close of
the great internecine struggle, was perhaps the
last he ever read. He had served a losing cause
with distinction, twice receiving promotion on the
battlefield, and he wore the uniform of a general
when, leading a charge in one of the last skirmishes 
of the war, he dropped from his horse,
mortally wounded by a flying shell. He was carried 

<!-- page 58 -->

to a farmhouse near by, and there died, after
some hours of intense agony. His sister's letter
was found, stained with his life-blood, in his
breast-pocket. It was carried back to her by his
faithful body-servant.</p>

<p>The gallant young general was buried in the
garden of the farmhouse. The remnant of his
brigade, grim and powder-blackened and silent,
followed the body to the grave; a detachment from
the &mdash;&mdash;th, his own old regiment, fired the last
volley above it.</p>

<br/>

<p>A sudden plunge from affluence into poverty, so
painful in most cases to middle or old age, has no
terrors for childhood. That happy-go-lucky age
cares little&mdash;so its stomach be decently lined
(and even on this point it is not over particular!)&mdash;whether 
its raiment be linen or gunny-sack; its
sleep is as sound on a pallet as in a four-posted
bed with high-piled mattress and silken hangings.
To the Blackmore girls and Roy Hilliard the
Second there seemed no change worth noting. A
world had tumbled in pieces; the crash in the
ears of their elders was appalling. But the old
house stood firm, though in course of time the
plastering dropped and the paint scaled. The
same portraits of past-and-gone chatelaines looked
down from the walls, though the stately array of
servants that did their bidding had dwindled to
old Martha alone in the kitchen, and old Robert
alone with his dead master's decrepit war-horse in

<!-- page 59 -->

the stable. The garden, with imaginary griffins,
or black-bearded giants lurking behind lilac and
syringa bushes, was there; it became indeed more
fascinating as the unpruned vines hid the doors of
the summer-houses, and the grass waved knee-deep
over the flower-beds; the carriage-house remained,
with the great family carriage, and master's stanhope 
and Ole Mis' buggy,&mdash;all, perforce, fallen
into disuse, but the noblest of hiding-places;
stable-loft, greenhouses, tool-house, had lost even
the memory of their times of riotous living, but
what unparalleled playhouses!</p>

<p>"Don't fret, Amanda. Poverty will not hurt
them," Doctor Greaves said half mockingly one
day just before he died. He was sitting on the
broad front gallery with Mrs. Blackmore. The
sturdy boy and the five ruddy-faced bareheaded
girls were playing a round game in a corner of the
rose-garden. The refrain of the catch they were
singing came into the gallery, intermingled with
bursts of boisterous laughter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p clas="small">"What care I for gold and silver?<br/>

What care I for house and land?"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"It is true," continued the old man earnestly.
"They do not care. Why should they? They,
who have so much! Poverty will not hurt them,
I tell you. It is good for them. It will strengthen
them, and it will teach them the value of many
things."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," returned the despoiled chatelaine
with a wistful sigh.</p>

<!-- page 60 -->

<p>She held fast to the old house through thick
and thin, and by dint of patient and anxious managing 
she gave her daughters what education the
town afforded&mdash;unsettled and distracted as it was
by the after-effects of the war. But with the
old-fashioned distinction between the needs of the
sexes, she sent Leroy to college. He graduated
with an average record as a student and an enviable 
reputation among his fellows for loyalty,
pluck, and manliness.</p>

<p>The next day after his return to the only home
he could remember, he followed Mrs. Blackmore
into her small morning-room. It was the room
which had been from time immemorial sacred to
the Hilliard women-folk; the room which, for a
few weeks in war-time, Colonel Hilliard had used
as his private office, and where an abandoned
child had found a second father. "Aunt Amanda,"
he said, dropping on the rug at her feet, and folding 
his arms across her lap,&mdash;his favorite attitude, 
"did my father ever express to you any
especial wish as to what I should be, or do, in
life?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Blackmore, passing her hand
affectionately through the dark curls clustered
thick over the white brow. "No, dear. He could
not, of course, foresee all the changes which have
come to pass. He probably looked forward to
sending you abroad for a year or two, as he himself 
was sent, as his father before him was sent,
to see something of the great world outside; and

<!-- page 61 -->

afterward he would have made you his successor
in the management of the plantations he owned;
or, if he had chosen a profession for you, it would,
I am sure, have been the law. My father, although 
a planter, was a lawyer also."</p>

<p>"Yes," assented the lad eagerly; "I know what
an eminent lawyer my grandfather Hilliard was.
I am sure this would have been my father's choice.
I shall make the law my profession, later; but
first of all, Aunt Amanda, I am going to work,
for anybody, and at anything which will pay me
decent wages. Do you think I do not realize&mdash;now,&mdash;I 
have been blind enough all these years,
but the scales of selfishness have fallen from my
eyes! Do you imagine that I do not know what
sacrifices you and the girls have made for me?
But now, please God&mdash;oh, you need not try to put
your hand over my mouth, Aunt Amanda! I am a
man, you know, and a Hilliard, and I will have my
way!" He drew the dear face, seamed and lined
by care, down to his own, and kissed the thin
cheek. "Now," he continued, leaping lightly to
his feet, "I am going to try and prove myself
worthy of the grand old name I bear,&mdash;worthy
of my father who left it to me as my noblest heritage;" 
his voice dropped to a reverential tone with
the last words. He seemed to see before him once
more the martial figure in gray uniform, the grave
kindly face with the wonderful eyes, which he remembered 
so well. "I cannot fail," he murmured
to himself, "for <i>he</i> will be my inspiration."</p>

<!-- page 62 -->

<p>The feeling of young Leroy Hilliard for the
man whose son he believed himself to be almost
amounted to idolatry; Hilliard's lightest word, his
most careless glance, remained graven on his memory, 
as if written with steel in his very being,&mdash;like 
his own birth-mark! He rarely spoke of his
dead father outside of his family circle, and he
heard with pained astonishment the light and careless 
remarks made by other young men about their
fathers. "It is not because I am different from
other sons," he often thought; "it must be because
he was&mdash;is&mdash;so different from other fathers!
And I shall succeed because he will be watching
over me."</p>

<p>But success does not always go hand in hand
with enthusiasm. Leroy Hilliard the Second
found many and bitter disappointments in his
brave and tireless struggle to gain a firm foothold
in the petty business world immediately around
him; and at length, nearly two years after his
return from college, and the day upon which a
well-to-do classmate of his own married Mary
Blackmore, the oldest of his adopted sisters, he
sought Mrs. Blackmore again in her morning-room.</p>

<p>"No, I am not downhearted," he said, smiling
up at her with his arms crossed on her lap, "for
that is what your blessed blue eyes are saying,
whatever your lips may say; but now that you
have Howard to take my place"&mdash;</p>

<p>"No one can ever take your place," interrupted

<!-- page 63 -->

Mrs. Blackmore, with something of her brother's
occasional sternness.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know;" a lump rose unexpectedly in
his throat; "and I know that there is a crust for
me on the table, and a corner for me in the old
house, as long as the crusts hold out, and the old
house stands on its foundation, God bless its rafters! 
But you must let me go away now, Aunt
Amanda. There is surely a place for me&mdash;and
a fortune into the bargain!&mdash;somewhere in the
world. And I think that I have at least found
the place. Look here."</p>

<p>He drew some papers from his breast-pocket.
"In West Texas"&mdash;he continued.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blackmore gasped and paled; it was as
much as if he had said the Fiji Islands, or Siberia,
or the Moon! But she listened patiently to the
scheme which in truth sounded vain and boyish to
her sober ears.</p>

<p>There was, it appeared, a tract of rich bottom-land, 
with some fine prairie pasturage, to be had
on easy terms along a certain Mesquit Creek in
Western Texas. The place had been under cultivation, 
was fenced and partly stocked with farming
implements. There was a roomy and comfortable
dwelling, with stables, outhouses, etc., a well, and
a good orchard. The opportunity for getting rich
by farming and stock-raising lay under the very
feet of any young man who had the pluck and the
brains to stoop and pick it up; the agent wrote
with an enthusiasm which was catching to an inexperienced 
youngster.</p>

<!-- page 64 -->

<p>"I can get all the money I need for a start, and
I shall make a fortune on that Texas ranch for
you and the girls, Aunt Amanda," he cried playfully,&mdash;and 
in his secret heart believing more
than he said,&mdash;folding up the letter. "I shall
call it the Amanda ranch! And while I am amassing 
that fortune the agent writes so glibly about, I
shall complete my law studies. Who knows but
you may see me a fat pursy old chief justice, yet!"</p>

<p>But it was not until after much and grave
family discussion, and much weeping and wailing
on the part of his foster sisters, that Hilliard finally
prevailed.</p>

<p>He stopped at Crouch's Well one day late in
October, and in company with Amen Bagley, who
good-naturedly volunteered to show him the way
thither, he proceeded to his ranch on Mesquit
Creek, some six miles distant. His heart fell as
they drew rein at length beside a broken rail-fence; 
and he surveyed the roomy "and comfortable 
dwelling" described in the agent's letter. It
was a one-roomed log-cabin, with a porch in front,
and a shed in the rear. The top of the rock chimney 
had tumbled in, the doors and the shutter of
the single window see-sawed on broken hinges,
the weather-boarding was mildewed and rotting,
weeds grew breast-high through the cracks in the
porch floor, and completely hid the rickety steps.
There were no outhouses; in one corner of what
may once have been the stable-lot, a confused pile
of scantlings and shingles remained to tell of a

<!-- page 65 -->

stable, or cow-shed, or a cotton-pen,&mdash;perhaps in
its day all three! The orchard, except for one
forlorn peach-tree, whose leafless branches whipped
the corner of the house, existed only in the agent's
imagination. The fields had long been turned out
to grass; the fences were down. A plentiful crop
of sunflower-stalks and kurkle-burrs, indeed, gave
token of rich soil, but Hilliard was not farmer
enough to understand this.</p>

<p>A keen norther was blowing; it whistled through
the pecan-trees and the naked cottonwood-trees on
the banks of the creek which skirted the fields;
crows were screaming in the topmost branches of
the trees, bushy-tailed squirrels whisked up and
down the trunks, a few razor-back hogs nosed the
dry rustling leaves below, squealing and eying the
two human intruders viciously.</p>

<p>Not a word passed between Hilliard and his
companion for some moments. The former kept
his face set steadily toward the dilapidated cabin;
he was still young enough to have a lump inconveniently 
ready to mount to his throat. Bagley
cast a side glance at him, but delicately refrained
from speech. Finally, he gathered up his bridle-reins. 
"There's one comfort, Mr. Hilliard," he
drawled. "You can wollop Benson, the agent.
He lives down the creek. If you need a hand,
call on me."</p>

<p>This speech somehow loosened Hilliard's tense
nerves. He threw back his head and burst into a
roar of gay boyish laughter.</p>

<!-- page 66 -->

<p>"Amen!" laughed Bagley; and he reached out
a hand and slapped the newcomer heartily on the
back.</p>

<p>The next day Mr. Bagley reported at Crouch's:
"The boy is young, and he's as green as a cymlin,
of course. But he'll do. He's gritty. He
talked all the way over about his 'ranch,' and his
dwellin'-house and stables. I thought I'd bust,
but I didn't let on. I waited to see what sort o'
spunk he'd show when he saw Bill Kinchley's rotten 
old shanty. I'll be d&mdash;d if he didn't take it
like a briar-breaker! I saw him swaller pretty
hard once or twice, and that squeenchy mark on
his face looked like a blaze o' lightnin'. And
then he set his jaw, and then he laughed, and I
knowed he was game. And I hope to God he'll
whack the life out of Benson."</p>

<br/>

<p>There were many times during the next year
when Hilliard would gladly have turned tail and
fled; many times when he longed to cross his arms
on Aunt Amanda's lap and sob out his ups and
downs like a child; many more times when he
swore he would wollop Benson without anybody's
help. But he did none of these things. He kept
his troubles to himself, and thanks to Amen Bagley's 
timely remark, which tickled the fountain of
healthful laughter, he never again experienced the
utterly helpless and dismal dismay which threatened 
to swamp him that October afternoon.</p>

<p>By the end of the third year, his hard and systematic 

<!-- page 67 -->

labor showed results nothing short of marvelous 
in the eyes of his easy-going neighbors.
The repaired cabin had become a snug and habitable 
abode, albeit showing in a certain picturesque
disorder within unmistakable signs of a bachelor
proprietor. The fields, outlined with good fences,
were white, in crop-time, with bursting cotton-bolls,
the rough cribs were piled with corn and fodder,
hogs were fattening in the creek-bottom, a small
bunch of cattle grazed on the open prairie-land,
there were a couple of mules and a saddle-horse in
the stable. A vigorous young orchard flanked the
cabin on one side, and a vegetable garden, with
homely flowers bordering its squares, the other.
Hilliard himself worked all day beside his two
hired Mexicans, Juan and Manuel; he wagoned his
own cotton and pecan crops to W&mdash;&mdash;, a hundred
miles away; he did his own housework.</p>

<p>"Your questions are searching, not to say impertinent, 
young women," he wrote gayly to his
foster sisters in Carolina. "But I do not mind
telling you that I have a valet&mdash;a remarkably fine
fellow&mdash;for a valet! who makes my bed and my
coffee. The same useful individual saddles my
horse and polishes my boots on a Sunday (I scorn
shoes!). He even shaves me and curls my hyacinthine 
locks with a curling iron. His name?
Oh, it is Leroy Hilliard."</p>

<p>In a more serious strain he wrote to Mrs. Blackmore: 
"The ranch, which, by the way, is not a
ranch at all, but only an insignificant farm, grows

<!-- page 68 -->

more and more homelike. Next year, remember,
you are to come out and visit me. I shall come
after you, as soon as my cotton is laid by. I am
hoping that you will consent&mdash;now that the girls
are all married&mdash;to stay with me altogether. I
throw up my hat at the thought! Meantime, the
place and all its belongings are paid for, and you
cannot, in justice to me, persist in your refusal to
let me help take care of you. Dear Aunt Amanda,
you wish to make me jealous of your new sons-in-law!"</p>

<p>VI</p>

<p class="small">A BAPTIZING</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sunday</span> afternoon, early in the June of eighteen 
hundred and eighty-three.</p>

<p>The new-fangled religious service with its amazing 
down-sittings and uprisings, the short but
soul-swelling sermon, the "sandy" little preacher
in his robe, the texture and shape of the robe itself&mdash;all 
these weighty matters had been gravely
discussed over the abundant basket-dinner spread
out on the grass in the pecan grove behind the
church.</p>

<p>There remained time&mdash;before the baptizing&mdash;for 
a little neighborhood gossip. To this end, the
congregation had broken up into groups, which
were scattered over the unfenced grounds, the
more forehanded choosing their places on or near
the banks of the creek.</p>

<p>Peleg Church stood on the brow of a long slope
which dipped gently down to Mesquit Creek. A
dozen sturdy pecan-trees sheltered its rear from
the north winds, a single enormous live-oak shaded
its wide, low, front doorway from the summer sun.
A number of mesquit trees studded the slope, giving 
it the appearance of an abandoned peach

<!-- page 70 -->

orchard; the soft mesquit grass made a carpet
under foot, green or brown, according to the season 
of the year.</p>

<p>The lonely church, for the nearest habitation
was several miles away, was a weather-stained log-house, 
with a rock chimney bulging out from one
end, a door opening to the east and facing the
creek, and a single heavy-shuttered sashless window 
on each side. Within, there was an ample
fireplace, and a cramped box-pulpit, before which
stood several ranges of split-log benches innocent
of backs. The building had been raised (on
ground donated by himself) by Uncle Joe Wyatt,
with the assistance of his neighbors. Uncle Joe
had also selected the name under which the church
had now been famous for the better part of ten
years. The day upon which the last hewn shingle
had been nailed into place, and the great wooden
latch mounted on the door, Mr. Wyatt, Bible in
hand, ascended the horseblock set up for the accommodation 
of the women-folk. "Fellow-citizens,
an' bretheren in the Lord," he said in a loud
oracular voice to the assembled multitude, "I have
been app'inted to pick out a name for this here
church-house. An' considerin' of the fac' that
the congregation to set under the droppin's of its
pul<i>pit</i> repersents all sorts o' <i>dee</i>-nominations,&mdash;Babtisses, 
Methodisses, Presber<i>tee</i>rians, <i>an'</i> Soul-Sleepers,&mdash;I 
p'opose callin' it Peleg Church,
Peleg bein' a Bible-name, the meanin' of which is
<i>divided:</i> 'And they called him <i>Peleg</i>, for in his

<!-- page 71 -->

day the earth was divided.' Genesis 10th chapter,
21st verse. This church-house, gentlemen, bein',
as it were, divided 'mongs' the aforesaid <i>dee</i>-nominations, 
Babtis, Methodis, Presber<i>tee</i>rian, <i>an'</i>
Soul-Sleepers, shell be hencefo'th an' forever, if
no objections is offered, Peleg Church."</p>

<p>The name was adopted with enthusiasm, and for
ten years the four Sundays of each month had
been parceled out according to Mr. Wyatt's calculation, 
leaving an occasional fifth for a protracted
meeting, or a combined religious debate, at which
all hands assisted.</p>

<br/>

<p>"You didn't count on Episcopalians, Uncle
Joe?" said Amen Bagley, lounging with young
Joe Wyatt up to the horseblock, where some of
the older men were still discussing the sermon.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," returned Mr. Wyatt shortly.
He was a large, ruddy-faced old man. His small
twinkling gray eyes were set in a network of wrinkles, 
which radiated away from them like the
spokes of a wheel; his cheeks and chin were lost
in a forest of stiff red beard. He walked wide-legged, 
and looked like a sailor, though he had
never seen salt water. "No, I didn't, an' what's
mo', I never counted on no preacher prancin'
aroun' in women's clo's. An' what's mo' yit, I
never counted on no young gals jawin' back at the
pul<i>pit</i> from the congregation. It's plum ridiculous. 
Saint Paul particular <i>said</i> that women-folks
wa'n't to speak out in the churches."</p>

<!-- page 72 -->

<p>"Lord, pap," grinned young Joe, "I don't call
that jawin'! I call it the cooin' o' honey-doves."</p>

<p>The old man followed the direction of his grandson's 
glance. His eyes rested for a moment on
Margaret Ransome, lately returned from a girl's
college in Kentucky, and her guest, Miss Wingate, 
who had accompanied her home. These
were the culprits who had assisted at the novel
service. Uncle Joe, if the truth must be told, had
been startled out of his customary nap by their
responses; hence his indignation.</p>

<p>The two young women stood arm in arm in the
doorway of Peleg. Their pretty heads were bent
in anxious consultation over those pages in the
Book of Common Prayer devoted to the Ceremony
of the Baptism of Adults.</p>

<p>"Waal! Waal!" chuckled Mr. Wyatt, his face
clearing. "I reckon the 'Piscopals is ho'ped up
by sech foolishness. Lord knows I don't blame
'em! We've got to make room for the 'Piscopals
somehow, or somehow else," he added cheerfully.
"They don't calc'late to come more 'n onct or twict
a year nohow, includin' of the bishop. I'm a
Soul-Sleeper myself, an' I'm mighty willin' to let
'em have a Soul-Sleepin' Sunday." Here Uncle
Joe winked solemnly at the crowd. "I wish they'd
hurry up the babtizin'," he wound up fervently.</p>

<p>"I'm plum on eedge about this here baptizin',
an' that's the truth," broke out a tall middle-aged
man standing near. This was Green Parsons,
whose twin brother, Red, was the single candidate

<!-- page 73 -->

for baptism that day. "I don't keer nothin' 'bout
Red jinin' the <i>E</i>-piscopals. I was with him over
in San Antone when he heard the sermon that
fetched his soul to grace. Bishop Elliott preached
it. Bishop Elliott's a whale if there ever was
one! But what in thunderation has Red set hisse'f 
up to be dipped for? I'm a Methodist myse'f, 
an' sprinklin' is good enough for me. Ef
he is so dead set to be baptized diff'ent, whyn't
he have pourin'? But no, the blame fool must
be dipped, like a durn Baptis&mdash;'scusin' of any
Baptisses here present. An' I don't believe Brother 
French <i>kin</i> dip Red. Look at Red Parsons
yonder, an' then look at Brother French! I ain't
afeared that <i>Red</i>'ll git drownded, but"&mdash;He
pursed up his lips and shook his head ominously.</p>

<p>Red Parsons was seated on the ground not far
away, with his back against a tree, his long legs
stretched out before him. The twins were almost
ludicrously alike, but just now Red's dark eyes
had a far-away look, as different as possible from
the fretful scowl in his brother's; his sallow lantern-jawed 
face was alight from some inner ecstasy.
His lips moved in silent prayer, and he glanced
from time to time toward the creek, as if impatient 
for the approaching ceremony.</p>

<p>"He 'lows Phil-up an' the eunuch is his eggsample," 
resumed Green, in an aggrieved tone,
"but how does he know that Phil-up dipped the
eunuch, when they went down <i>toe</i> the water?
That's what I want to know! He might jest

<!-- page 74 -->

as well ha' poured, or sprinkled. <i>I</i> say sprinkled!"</p>

<p>The Reverend David French, on the farther
side of the grounds, was walking up and down,
with his hands clasped behind his back. His
outer appearance betokened a calm which he was
far from feeling. He was indeed a prey to an
interior agitation which he prayerfully sought to
control.</p>

<p>He was a small, delicate looking man about
thirty years old, with reddish curling hair, a
smooth, boyish face, and short-sighted gray eyes.
He wore spectacles. His neat clerical dress excited 
hardly less comment among the Peleg people&mdash;whom 
he had addressed that morning for the
first time&mdash;than the flowing gown and bands
which he had worn in the pulpit. The eyes of
most of those present were upon him as he paced
back and forth&mdash;taking his measure, but with
rustic dispassionateness withholding judgment until 
the facts of the case were all presented.</p>

<p>His lips, like those of the candidate for baptism,
moved in mute prayer, and he too glanced from
time to time toward the creek, but with an apprehension 
of which he was much ashamed.</p>

<p>"I am astounded at my weakness," he breathed,
within himself. "But I have never even witnessed
a baptizing by immersion. Will I be able to perform 
the sacrament properly? . . . I dare not
risk making the Church ridiculous. . . . I do not
know whether or not a priest under such circumstances 

<!-- page 75 -->

should wear his robes. . . . Lord, forgive
me for dwelling, at such a moment, upon things
so trivial. And, Lord, help me to do my duty."</p>

<p>The women had gathered in a body on the shady
side of the church. The children raced unrestricted
about the slope. A few of the younger men had
ventured near the tacit line of demarcation between
the male and female folds, in the hope of attracting 
the attention of the younger women. These
giggled together, flauntingly oblivious of this strategic 
advance.</p>

<p>"Ef Brother Whipple was here," observed Mrs.
Crouch, the postmaster's wife, "he'd make them
onrighteous boys keep their distance."</p>

<p>"I don't think it matters much about the boys,
Sister Crouch," said Aunt Lindy Wyatt soothingly; 
"they ain't supposed to have much sense!
But look at Red Parsons! He ought to be ashamed
of hisse'f makin' that pore little creeter resk his
life to dip him,&mdash;the gret, gangly darnin'-needle!"</p>

<p>"I've worked on Red all I could," said Mrs.
Red, feeling to blame.</p>

<p>"The Parsonses was born hard-headed," said
Mrs. Green apologetically.</p>

<p>Mrs. Red and Mrs. Green might have been
twins like their husbands, so alike were they in
appearance,&mdash;short, rotund, and perpetually rosy
from the exertion of keeping their lords reconciled
to each other, and their large families in order.</p>

<p>"Sech foolishness," reiterated Mrs. Wyatt;
"whyn't he jine the Babtisses an' be done with it!"</p>

<!-- page 76 -->

<p>"Where's Roy Hilliard?" demanded one of the
group irrelevantly. "An' Jack Ransome?" All
eyes were turned on Jack's mother.</p>

<p>"They promised to come," returned Mrs. Ransome, 
knitting her brows anxiously.</p>

<p>"I hope they ain't up to any mischief," said
Mrs. Crouch. "Sence this bob-wire fence business"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Mary," interrupted Helen Wingate,
hastening to Mrs. Ransome. "It is time. Mr.
French has gone into the church with Mr. Parsons." 
The women were instantly on their feet,
and the congregation hurried en masse to the
creek.</p>

<p>The creek, in the rainy season, generally in
February or March, deserved more than its name.
Then it might well have been called a river; then,
after the manner of West Texas streams, Mesquit
Creek roared, foaming and frothing, along its deep
bed, full to the brink; sweeping away bridges,
eating cave-like hollows in the high banks, and
tumbling the stones about on its uneven bottom.
At such times, it was dangerous enough. But
this tumultuous season overpast, it dwindled to a
mere rill, which the drift of leaves choked up entirely 
in many places; the giant tree-roots, laid
bare in flood-time, stuck out forlornly from the
rifted banks; the fish and eels died on the sun-baked 
rocks. Only where the bottom-lands were
low the water remained in reedy lakelets in the
shade of the dense undergrowth, and in the more

<!-- page 77 -->

open country, a pool here and there defied the
summer, and lay, deep, dark, and cool, beneath
overhanging trees.</p>

<p>No-Bottom Hole, by Peleg Church, was such a
pool. Parts of it were popularly held to be of
almost measureless depth; even its upper loop,
used as a baptizing-pool, was, according to some,
a little "resky." It held no terrors for the Baptist 
brethren, however; their converts had walked
down the slope these many years hand in hand
with Elder Whipple,&mdash;a giant in body, as well
as in soul.</p>

<p>But a tremor of anxious, not to say almost contemptuous, 
pity ran through the crowd which
opened to let the Reverend David French and his
companion pass to the grassy space on the edge of
the pool. The Reverend David looked so little!
He wore his black robe, and carried an open
prayer-book in his hand. The sun glinted on his
spectacles.</p>

<p>Red Parsons, towering above him, listened in
rapt eagerness to the opening exhortation; and he
answered "like a book" the questions put to him.
Margaret Ransome and Helen Wingate stumbled
and stammered through those parts assigned by
the prayer-book to the people. All this seemed
mysterious and almost unnatural to the multitude
unused to such proceedings. But all stood bare-headed 
and respectfully silent.</p>

<p>Finally the supreme moment came. The little
preacher's face was very pale; the muscles in his

<!-- page 78 -->

temples twitched as he laid his hand on the arm
of his tall disciple and began with him the descent
of the steep bank; his knees trembled beneath his
fluttering gown.</p>

<p>Suddenly he began to sing:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Soldiers of Christ, arise,<br/>

And gird your armor on."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>His voice was not loud. It was in fact curiously
thin and bodiless, so to speak. But it came up
from the hollow of the creek like the fine far-away
call of a silver trumpet. It thrilled those who
heard. They pressed forward and gazed open-mouthed 
and breathless on the singer.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Strong in the strength which God supplies,<br/>

Through His eternal Son."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The Reverend David had set his foot in the water.
His voice gained fullness as he waded on. The
big man beside him looked down at him with an
anxious, brooding gaze, as if he longed to take
him in his arms and bear him to safety. He
touched his shoulder occasionally, as who should
say like Hopeful to Christian in the river: "Be
of good cheer, my brother. I feel the bottom,
and it is good."</p>

<p>But now they had come to a halt and faced
about.</p>

<p>"He'll never do it, never!" muttered Amen
Bagley, noting that the water was breast-high to
the diminutive shepherd, while it barely touched
the waist of the sheep. Amen shut his eyes
tightly. The next moment he opened them. Red

<!-- page 79 -->

Parsons's head with David's hand underneath was
just rising from the surface of the pool. A second
later he was firmly planted on his feet, and the
preacher, reaching up, was gently wiping the water
from his face.</p>

<p>"Amen! Glory to God!" shouted Amen Bagley. 
"Glory! Glory!" responded the people in
an ecstasy; the triumphant cry echoed up and
down the hollow of the creek. The Reverend Mr.
French never heard it; his soul had withdrawn
into itself in silent thanksgiving. But as they
came up out of the water, he took up the strain
again:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Soldiers of Christ, arise,<br/>

And gird your armor on."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The people, catching with ready ear both tune
and words, joined in:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Strong in the strength which God supplies,<br/>

Through His eternal Son."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And they pressed forward, one by one, after their
homely accustomed fashion, to give the right hand
of fellowship to the man of God and the brand
which he had rescued from the burning.</p>

<p>It was a great victory for the Reverend David,
though in his simplicity he did not suspect it.</p>

<p>"Spunky little chap, ain't he!" beamed Mr.
Wyatt to those around him. "Could dip Phil-up
an' a whole rig'mint o' eunuchs, if he had to. Oh
yes, we've got to make room in Peleg somehow,
or somehow else, for the 'Piscopals."</p>

<p>The twin brothers had walked off together arm

<!-- page 80 -->

in arm. There was unbroken silence between
them until they reached the black-haw thicket
where Red was to exchange his wet clothes for dry
ones. There, as he held aside the outstretched
branches for Red to pass into the heart of the
thicket, Green remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The New Testament says that Phil-up an' the
eunuch went down <i>toe</i> the water. Now Phil-up
cert'ny baptized that eunuch. The question is,
<i>how</i> did he do it? <i>I</i> say by sprinklin'. But then
ag'in it <i>might</i> ha' been by pourin'."</p>

<p>This unexpected concession brought tears to
Red's eyes.</p>

<p>"I ain't got but one regret," continued Green
thoughtfully, assisting his twin to haul off his
dripping flannel blouse, "an' that is, that Elder
Whipple wa'n't here to-day to see what a powerful
dipper a <i>E</i>-piscopal can be&mdash;when he's <i>got</i> to
dip!"</p>

<p>The scene around Peleg Church was now one of
loud and familiar activity. Teams were being
harnessed, or, in the vernacular of the region,
"hooked up;" chairs for the married women set
into open wagons, and quilts thrown in for the
children to sit upon; dishes re-packed, feed-troughs
emptied of shucks and corn-cobs, dogs whistled in,
saddles girthed, riding-skirts adjusted. The unmarried 
girls waiting around the horseblock for
their horses followed the unwritten law of Peleg
and beamed with friendly eyes and coquettish
smiles on the young men, kept at so severe a distance 

<!-- page 81 -->

all day; these, booted and spurred, stood
ready to leap into their saddles and make a mad
dash after the neighborhood belles. No open or
tacit engagements for the ride home were allowed
in the Peleg code; each man must take his chance
according to the speed of his horse, his own horsemanship, 
or the diplomacy of the young woman in
question. And the fine art of "cutting-out" was
practiced almost as a profession at Peleg and all
through Crouch's Settlement.</p>

<p>Into this cheerful stir there came from far up
the winding road the clatter of horse's hoofs; and
a young man, riding at a hand gallop, turned a
bend and came into view. He was followed by
three or four other men.</p>

<p>"Hello, Roy!" shouted young Joe Wyatt, as
the foremost rider came up and threw himself from
his horse, which was reeking with foam. "What's
up? Where have you all been? Whyn't you
come to church? You'll ketch it, you all!"</p>

<p>"There is nothing the matter," returned the
newcomer smiling. He lifted his hat as he spoke
to the group of young women, which included
Helen Wingate and Margaret Ransome.</p>

<p>Then turning swiftly, he added in a low undertone 
to the men who had hastened forward and
were gathered about him, "The news was correct. 
The wire fences have been stretched around
Vaquero Spring ever since Monday. Crawls's
Pond is shut in; Granny Tatums's whole place is
shut in. Three out of her little bunch of cattle are

<!-- page 82 -->

dead. We counted fourteen of Uncle Joe Wyatt's, 
dead or dying, on Crawls's prairie. We
have been over to the superintendent's camp and
remonstrated with him and his factotum. But we
got no satisfaction. They were not even civil"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Civil!" interrupted Jack Ransome, his black
eyes flashing, "they threatened to shoot us if we
ever came within five hundred yards of their
camp!"</p>

<p>"That's not all," put in another of the riders;
"there's another camp about fourteen miles east,
about Haley's tank. They've run a fence there.
I saw some freighters this morning; they said the
dead cattle were lying around there, thick as
honey-bees."</p>

<p>A chorus of angry exclamations had broken out
among the listeners.</p>

<p>"Shet up, boys," growled Uncle Joe Wyatt,
who had hurried over from his wagon. "Ain't
ye got more sense than to skeer the women-folks
to death? Come over to Crouch's to-morrow, all
of ye. To-morrow at ten."</p>

<p>"What's the matter, pap?" called his wife in
her shrill, high-keyed old voice.</p>

<p>"Nawthin', maw, nawthin'. The boys is jest
makin' up a rabbit-hunt." The old man was
walking off, but he turned his head to wink solemnly 
at his companions.</p>

<p>"Now, ain't that scan'lous," cried Mrs. Crouch
from her seat in a spring-wagon. " 'Tain't haffen
hour sence the sperrit o' grace was fair hoverin'

<!-- page 83 -->

over Peleg. An' here's them on-Christian backslidin' 
boys talkin' about huntin' jack-rabbits!"</p>

<p>Her voice was drowned in the rush of horses'
feet. The young women, already mounted, were
off like the wind, looking demurely ahead of them,
but quite conscious of the cavaliers riding after,
with the jingle of silver spurs and silver-bitted
bridles.</p>

<p>Leroy Hilliard and his squad had leaped again
into their saddles. They had ridden hard all day;
their horses were jaded and foam-flecked. But
they pushed the fresher riders hard. Hilliard himself, 
neck and neck for a quarter of a mile with
young Joe Wyatt, shot past him at length with a
gay nod and drew alongside of Miss Wingate on
her fleet bay filly.</p>

<p>The sun was near its setting; a yellow haze filtered 
through the scant foliage of the stubby post-oaks 
that covered the wide monotonous stretch of
rolling country; it illuminated the flying cavalcade, 
bringing out vivid bits of color here and
there, and turning into gold the powdery dust
that arose from under the horses' feet; light
laughter and the echo of youthful voices filled the
warm air. It was such a scene as old-time poets
loved to imagine, and old-time painters to put
upon canvas!</p>

<p>The heavily-laden and more sober wagons rumbled 
away from Peleg Church in every direction.
The last one to roll out was a big-bodied, many-seated 
freight-wagon, which carried the united

<!-- page 84 -->

families of the Parsons twins. The Reverend
David French occupied the front seat in this with
Red and a couple of babies. The last gleam of
sunlight slanted across the slope as they drove off,
leaving the isolated church to its coming week of
silence and solitude.</p>

<p>VII</p>

<p class="small">CROUCH'S WELL</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Billy Crouch</span> was a briar-breaker, that is to
say, one of the pioneers in the settlement which
bore his name. His small farm lay on the public
road, about midway between the little town of
Skipton and Rassler, the county-seat, some thirty
miles apart. His unpainted frame house had two
stories,&mdash;a circumstance which gave the family a
certain distinction among their friends and neighbors, 
though some affected to decry the arrangement 
as unnatural, not to say iniquitous. "I
don't see what call Sister Calline Crouch has to
be so biggaty," Mrs. Green Parsons often remarked. 
"One room on top of another ain't no
better than one room behint another, as I can see.
And them child-breakin'-neck stair-steps is plum
wicked."</p>

<p>Mr. Crouch's field stretched away in the rear
of the house; its cultivation fell chiefly upon Mrs.
Crouch and the children, Billy having other and
more important business to occupy him. To the
left of the front porch, and about fifty steps away,
a grove of fine pecan-trees embraced in their shade
Crouch's Well, with its high stone curbing, its

<!-- page 86 -->

great limestone slab cover with a circular opening
in the centre for the pulley-rope, and its twin
buckets. The road broadened as it approached
the inward sweeping curve made by the rail fence
at this spot; several hitching-posts had been set
up, and a big wooden trough on sturdy legs was
placed in a fence corner.</p>

<p>All teams which passed along the road going
or coming stopped to water at Crouch's Well.
The water, slightly milky from a superabundance
of lime, was deliciously cool when it came up from
the dark rock-lined bottom. The thirsty traveler,
man or beast, could never get enough of it. There
was an endless creaking of the rope over the pulley, 
a continuous gurgle and splash into the trough,
and what with the comfortable lingering of those
already there, and the arrival of fresh throats to
be cooled, and fresh bottle-gourds to be filled, there
was hardly an hour from year's end to year's end
when there was not a rattle of trace-chains, a
crunch of starting or stopping wheels, a cracking
of long-lashed whips, an uproar of voices, and an
echo of mellow laughter around Crouch's Well.
Even at night the flare of camp-fires shone in the
dip of woods beyond, and the pulley creaked at
intervals between sundown and dawn.</p>

<p>Billy gave this water of life freely, without
money and without price, and exceeding great was
his reward!</p>

<p>Mr. Crouch's responsibilities as a family man
sat lightly upon his shoulders; indeed, his smooth

<!-- page 87 -->

pink cheeks, blue eyes, and rotund little figure
hardly seemed accordant with such burdens. He
had eight children to be fed, clothed, and schooled,
but the oldest of these, Lorena, a long-legged,
soft-voiced girl of sixteen, took after her mother,
who, according to common report, was a "buster,"
and between mother and daughter the place was
"run" more or less successfully, while Billy sat
on the fence and talked politics to the tune of his
creaking well-pulley. Twice a week, on Monday
and Saturday, his opportunities in this direction
rose to a high level. These were mail-days. And
Mr. Crouch was the postmaster.</p>

<p>On these days, soon after sun-up, the men of
the settlement began to ride in after their mail.
Some of them received a letter about once a year;
several took the "Weekly Baptist Herald," "The
Christian Advocate," or "The Observer;" others
expected a pair of boots, a slicker, a pistol, or a
bundle of axe-handles&mdash;for nothing seemed amiss
in Crouch's mail; many had no correspondents,
and no expectations. But all came with unfailing
regularity. Pushing in by bridle-paths and wagon-roads, 
they rode up, dismounted, hitched their
horses, drew a bucket of water, tipped it to their
lips from the curb, took a deep draught, and remarked, 
with an air of saying something never said
before, that Crouch's well-water couldn't be beat.
Then they emptied the remaining water into the
trough, and climbed upon the fence. There, like
a row of vari-colored crows, in their blue, or

<!-- page 88 -->

brown, or gray jeans trousers and white shirt-sleeves, 
they perched, talking politics&mdash;national
preferred&mdash;with the delighted Billy, until the
mail came; and herein consisted Billy's profit on
his well-water!</p>

<p>Somewhere between eleven o'clock <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> and
two <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> the mail-hack rattled up from Skipton;
the dusty team stopped of its own accord at the
water-trough; Sam Whitehead, the mail-carrier,
spat ostentatiously from one side of the hack, and
threw the mail-bags from the other. Occasionally,
when he drove a hackful of drummers to Rassler,
he forgot to fetch the mail. Nobody, except Billy,
minded very much; and Billy was only exercised
for the dignity of his position.</p>

<p>When the letters and other contents of the mail-bags 
had been distributed from the porch, and the
candle-box, sacred to post-office affairs, shoved
back under his own bed, Mr. Crouch returned
with renewed zest to his roost on his fence. Meanwhile, 
Mrs. Crouch, a tall, bony woman, some
years older than her husband, coming in from the
field, would have said to Lorena: "Go out yander,
honey, an' find out how many o' them mens folks
yo' pa has asked to stay to dinner."</p>

<p>The long-legged Lorena invariably brought back
word that pa had asked them all. A few, out of
consideration for Mrs. Crouch, a few others forethreatened 
by their own wives, might go; the
majority generally stayed; and for an hour or
more the clatter of coffee-cups and the rattle of

<!-- page 89 -->

knives and forks mingled with the creak of the
well-pulley.</p>

<p>"Billy is powerful sociable," Mrs. Crouch returned 
proudly to the sympathetic comments of
Mrs. Parsons and others, "an' I cert'ny ain't
complainin'. He kin ask the whole settlement,
drummers into the bargain, twict a week, if he
wants to."</p>

<p>But when some one suggested that Mr. Crouch
ought to set up a store on his premises, where the
settlement could trade, Mrs. Crouch interfered.
"No, Lorena," she said, talking it over afterward
with her help and mainstay. "I jest <i>had</i> to put
my foot down. Ef yo' pa was to open a sto' as
full of goods as the Ark was of animals, he'd <i>give</i>
'em all away befo' that sto' was open a week. No,
Billy Crouch is too free-handed to keep a sto'!"</p>

<br/>

<p>The morning after the Reverend David French's
first appearance at Peleg Church, the men of
Crouch's Settlement gathered as usual at Crouch's
Well. Some came at daybreak, having letters to
mail; no one lagged; nearly all wore a look of
deep expectation on their sun-browned faces. Mr.
Crouch, with unwonted forethought, had warned
his wife that "sompn was up, and there might be
a leetle company to dinner."</p>

<p>Each fresh arrival visited the well, drew a bucket
of water, tipped it to his lips from the curb, and
made the profoundly original remark that Crouch's
Well water couldn't be beat. Then, having

<!-- page 90 -->

poured a libation into the already overflowing
trough, he sought his accustomed place on the
fence.</p>

<p>No reference was made to the subject uppermost
in everybody's thoughts. There was a tacit agreement 
to leave that untouched until all interested
should be present. But there was always Congress
and its nefarious doings.</p>

<p>"What!" demanded Red Parsons, frowning,
"what do you make of this here new bill ag'in
three-cent postage-stamps, Billy? Seems to me
mighty"&mdash;here, his question being purely tentative, 
Red stopped and scratched his head.</p>

<p>"Ef cuttin' stamps down to two cents apiece
means redoocin' o' Billy's salary, I think we ought
to send in a petition," remarked Jesse Waldrup,
giving Billy time to ask himself what he did think.</p>

<p>"N-o-o," admitted the postmaster, pursing his
lips, "it don't redooce my salary none." Billy
himself was responsible for the prevailing belief
that the United States government paid him a
handsome salary for running the candle-box. "I
kin stand cuttin' down o' stamps to two cents ef
the President kin. But what <i>I</i> think is scan'lous
is the tariff. The tariff, gentle<i>men</i>"&mdash;And
Billy, like many another politician before and
after him, soared away into the azure region of
import-charges, repaying himself a thousand-fold
for all the delicious, milky, cool water that had
ever quenched the thirst of the settlement.</p>

<p>The others listened gravely, putting in a word

<!-- page 91 -->

now and then, with an air of vital interest. But
into the midst of Mr. Crouch's lucid peroration
there fell a sound which caused Uncle Joe Wyatt
to raise an interrupting hand. A moment later
Amos Bagley appeared, with Leroy Hilliard and
Jack Ransome riding at a smart pace beside him.
" 'Light, boys, 'light," cried Mr. Crouch hospitably. 
"I'm jist th'oo explainin' of the tariff."</p>

<p>"Amen," responded Bagley soberly; he dismounted 
and led his horse to the moss-lined
trough. His constant and unconscious use of this
ejaculation had procured his sobriquet; he had
long been known in the neighborhood as "Amen"
Bagley. He was a spare, well-built man, upwards
of fifty; a bachelor, and distinguished from the
general run of briar-breakers by his inveterate
habit of wearing a coat. He owned a small flock
of sheep, and the only threshing-machine in the
settlement. Even at sheep-dipping, or when driving 
the thresher over the fields under a broiling
sun, he was never seen in his shirtsleeves. But
he was much respected in the community. It was
said of him that he never took a dare or told a lie.</p>

<p>Hilliard had dropped his bridle on the pommel
of his saddle, and sat quietly waiting for his companions 
to water and hitch their horses. Uncle
Joe had called Mr. Crouch to where he sat, and
was holding a whispered consultation with him.
Billy, at its close, nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hilliard," began Mr. Wyatt, in a solemn
tone.</p>

<!-- page 92 -->

<p>Hilliard started at this unusual address, and
looked around inquiringly.</p>

<p>"It's the sense of this here meetin', as repersented 
by Billy an' me, Roy," continued Mr.
Wyatt, dropping into his every-day style and
manner, "for you to give yo' understandin' an'
opinion o' this here bob-wire-fence business, that
has jest crep' into Crouch's an' the a-jinin' settlements. 
Me an' Billy thinks you kin break the
briars offn the subjec' better 'n anybody else in
this community."</p>

<p>Leroy Hilliard, at the age of twenty-six, had
more than fulfilled his early promise of manly
beauty. He retained his striking likeness to the
gallant soldier whose name he bore; he was taller
and more slenderly built than the elder Hilliard
had been; his complexion, though bronzed by constant 
exposure, was fairer. But the square face,
the sensitive mouth and firm chin, the white forehead 
with its lengthwise furrow, the brooding yellow-glinted eyes&mdash;all 
these made of him a living
counterpart of the dead Hilliard.</p>

<p>Looking at him and listening to his full, flexible
voice when he spoke, it was easy enough to realize
that he was the most popular man on Mesquit
Creek. He had been considered by some a trifle
too "studdy" when he first arrived from the
States. His new-fangled improvements in farming 
had caused him to be set down as "biggaty."
But it was not long before the men admitted that
the newcomer could straddle a horse and shoot a

<!-- page 93 -->

rifle, sleep on the ground in camp, and sit on the
fence at Crouch's with the pick of them. The
women from the first mistrusted that there never
was a nimbler pair of legs in a reel, or a pair of
more skillful hands at a candy-pulling than Leroy
Hilliard's. "He might be a briar-breaker" was
the general verdict,&mdash;the highest praise known to
the settlement.</p>

<p>"And if anybody can explain the bob-wire contraption, 
Roy Hilliard can do it," Green Parsons
said, settling himself well on the top-rail of the
fence to listen.</p>

<p>Hilliard had studied the subject carefully. It
was one which had engrossed public attention in
the surrounding counties for months past, and it
took little sagacity to foresee that the swiftly
spreading evil would sooner or later invade the
whole of the western part of the State. Hilliard
had turned from newspaper reports, and from the
talk of passing drummers, who brought into
Crouch's accounts of the affair in its wider aspects,
to his law-books, over which he had lately begun
to pore with keen interest. He had examined
county maps, and located neighborhood claims and
holdings; he had looked up title-deeds, burrowing
into the earliest records of the county. Finally,
the day before, in company with Jack Ransome
and several others, he had ridden over a part of
the county, and attempted to interview the superintendent 
of one fence-building gang. The case,
as he briefly stated it, was this:&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 94 -->

<p>The public lands of Texas, free from the earliest 
times to the cattle roaming over them, were
offered in the early '80s for sale. These rich
and fertile acres were eagerly bought, the purchasers 
being, generally, men of great wealth, and
many of them strangers who had no interest in
claims or communities already existing. The
building of wire fences to inclose vast tracts of
these newly acquired lands had now been going
steadily forward for more than a year. Gangs of
laborers were at work putting down cedar posts,
and stretching interminable shining lines of barbed
wire in every direction. There was a certain recklessness 
in the proceeding, a disregard both of possible 
ownership and of propriety, which excited
profound indignation. In some quarters the public 
roads and familiar byways were closed up;
many small freeholds, belonging to the poorer men,
were fenced in; even larger places were practically
barred from communication with the common highways. 
But worst of all, the water supply, scarce
at all times in this region, was in many instances
cut off; springs, ponds, and water-holes were
ringed about with the formidable wire. Sometimes 
this was a legitimate proceeding on the part
of the new owner, sometimes it was the ignorant or
the willful misconception of an agent or a squad
of workmen. Thousands of cattle had already
perished, but the indignant remonstrances of the
people were met with indifference or contempt.</p>

<p>The feeling everywhere inborn in man, that

<!-- page 95 -->

water belongs to God, and therefore to all his
creatures, was heightened among old frontiersmen
by the fact that from the days when the redskin
roamed the prairies and the hardy pioneer disputed
the ground with him inch by inch, these springs
and waterways had been free alike to man and
beast. Excitement had already risen to fever
heat in the neighboring counties, and the wire
fences had been cut in hundreds of places. But
this part of the country, divided into scattered
settlements and therefore less desirable, had until
lately escaped the surveyor, the loud-mouthed
workmen, and the invading wagon-train with its
great spools of gray barbed wire.</p>

<p>Now, however, the outlook was becoming daily
more irritating. As the scouting party had reported 
at Peleg Church on Sunday, Vaquero
Spring, a perennial pool which welled up in a
shaded depression of the open prairie about sixteen
miles away toward the northeast, where numbers
of cattle watered, had been inclosed; a pond,
known as Crawls's Water-hole, on the prairie of
the same name, nine miles westward, had shared the
same fate. Granny Tatum's little property&mdash;cabin, 
turnip-patch, and field&mdash;now lay a forlorn
dot in the midst of an enormous fenced pasture.
Her out-thrust cattle were dying of thirst.</p>

<p>"We appealed to the superintendent at Vaquero
for justice," concluded Hilliard. "He laughed in
our faces. We then warned him that the men, in
this settlement at least, knew their rights in the

<!-- page 96 -->

matter, and would guard them. I am prepared to
prove that in the special cases cited there has been
a direct encroachment upon property belonging to
our people. The law"&mdash;</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n the law!" shouted Uncle Joe. "I ain't
goin' to wait for no law case to be drug an' drug
th'oo the court, whilse my cattle dies an' rots on
the prery for want of water."</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Wyatt," said Hilliard respectfully, 
lifting his hat. "I'm in line with you. I
told the superintendent that we would give him
twenty-four hours to open the wire to Crawls's
Pond and to Vaquero Spring. And that if he did
not see his way to doing this&mdash;out of common
justice and common humanity, we should come and
take down his fences for him. That was at eleven
o'clock precisely, yesterday morning. He swore
that he would shoot us down like dogs if we came
on any such errand."</p>

<p>A buzz of angry ejaculation passed along the
fence. Hilliard sat on his horse, awaiting the
result of the man to man conference which followed.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," cried Tom Roper, a stalwart
young farmer, presently, "I move that we ride
over to-night toward midnight and see if that
wire's down, and if it's not down, to cut it."</p>

<p>This proposition was greeted with a shout of
approval. The men got down from the fence to
stretch their legs; there was a general movement
in the direction of the well.</p>

<!-- page 97 -->

<p>"I beg your pardon, gentlemen." Hilliard's
voice arrested speech and movement. "I suggest
that whatever is done should be done in open daylight, 
and under fire, if necessary. We have justice 
on our side, and we don't need to work under
cover of darkness. I am myself willing to be one
of a party that will leave here within the hour."</p>

<p>An absolute silence, not of timidity, but of rumination, 
followed this speech. "All right," said
Roper carelessly. "Daylight suits me. I'll go."</p>

<p>Nearly every man present volunteered; but a
committee, composed of the elder Wyatt, Crouch,
and Bagley, decided that the delegation should
consist of six of the younger men under the conduct 
of Hilliard. These men were chosen by lot.
It was found, upon inquiry, that all of them except 
Hilliard himself were already armed. He
accepted the loan of a pistol from Bagley. "But
I will carry the nippers, also," he said, laughing,
slinging the short, thick shears to his saddle-bow.
"This is the weapon just now most dreaded by
Jellson and his sort."</p>

<p>It was half past eleven; Sam Whitehead drove
up from Skipton with the mail as they swung into
their saddles. He reported the wire on Crawls's
prairie still in place, and the cattle a-bellowin' for
water.</p>

<p>"Good luck go with ye, boys," sung out Uncle
Joe, as Hilliard and his men galloped away.</p>

<p>"Amen," responded Bagley, according to his
custom.</p>

<!-- page 98 -->

<p>An inspection of the cordon of wire which
crossed one of the county roads and cut off access
to Crawls's Water-hole was the first bit of work
laid out by Hilliard. This road branched off
westward from the main highway, a short distance
beyond Crouch's; it passed for several miles
through a tract of post-oak rough, dipped across
Mesquit Creek, near Hilliard's place, and wound
around a corner of Mrs. Ransome's farm. Beyond, 
a gradual rise ended in the broad plateau-like 
prairie. A wagon-road leading from Skipton
to Peleg Church here intersected it. Exactly at
the point made by these cross-roads, a cedar post
had been planted; five strands of heavy barbed
wire stretched away from it in either direction.</p>

<p>Here, the first fence-cutting in Crouch's Settlement 
took place&mdash;without let or hindrance. Not
a human creature was in sight. The mouse-colored 
road wound its way, visible to right and left,
for a long distance. The cattle, known by their
brands as Wyatt's, Ransome's, and Roper's,
roamed forlornly over the level plain, or lay panting 
and exhausted on the hot ground. Many were
already dead, and the west wind blowing over the
prairie was heavy with the stench of putrefying
flesh.</p>

<p>After the first howl of rage, the men dismounted
and went to work, grimly silent. Hilliard himself
set the nippers to the wire, while the others uprooted 
the post and flung it aside. From this
point they proceeded westward; the fence was cut

<!-- page 99 -->

in a dozen or more places within the stretch of a
couple of miles. The cattle were driven through
the gaps thus made and headed toward the pond.
Their hoarse bellow, as they charged pell-mell
across the prairie, shook the silence with a sound
like muttering thunder. With tails erect and
heads down, their parched tongues lolling from
their mouths, their eyes rolling furiously, they
pitched headlong into the open pool, many of
them perishing even as they slaked their thirst.</p>

<p>The wire-cutting was repeated where the fences
had been so drawn as to shut in Granny Tatum's
place and shut out her small bunch of cattle.
This done, the horses' heads were turned nearly
due northward, in the direction of Vaquero Spring,
where Jellson, the superintendent of the new Cottonwood 
Ranch, had his headquarters.</p>

<p>An abrupt rise from the plateau led to another,
whose farther boundary north and northeast was
a chain of flat-topped pyramidal hills, with occasional 
clean-cut gaps between the mesas. Hilliard
called a halt as they mounted the rise and came in
sight of the grove of cottonwood-trees clustered
above Vaquero Spring, and the tents gleaming
white beneath them. The mesas beyond were
wrapped in purple haze.</p>

<p>"Now, boys," said Hilliard gravely, "I claim
the rest of this business for myself."</p>

<p>A protesting murmur ran through the group
around him. "You will follow me," the young
leader continued, paying no attention to the interruption, 

<!-- page 100 -->

"as far as the bend in the road yonder.
I will ride on to the camp alone. I wish to say
a few words to Jellson. If he fails to listen to
reason, I will dismount and argue with him further&mdash;peaceably, 
you understand. You will remain 
on your horses, and you are not to shoot
unless I give the word. Is this understood?"</p>

<p>His authoritative yet winning manner compelled
a hearty "Yes" from his listeners. They all rode
rapidly to the point indicated, a curve in the road
about one hundred yards from the camp. Thence
Hilliard proceeded alone. He halted in front of
the wire fence which inclosed the camp and guarded
the disputed spring. In response to his loud halloo 
Jellson himself came out of one of the tents,
followed by three or four men. All appeared to
be armed. Jellson, a tall, powerfully-built man
of middle age, bull-necked and straight as an
arrow, carried a shotgun.</p>

<p>"What in h&mdash;ll do you want?" he growled,
approaching within easy speaking distance, but
signing his men to keep back. "I've had enough
of your impudence already, young man, and I
have already told you"&mdash;</p>

<p>Hilliard lifted his hat. "Mr. Jellson," he interrupted 
politely, "I have already told you that
you have trespassed&mdash;unintentionally, no doubt&mdash;on 
private property, and we have come to
ask"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Leave this place, sir!" thundered Jellson,
purple with rage. "If you"&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 101 -->

<p>"&mdash;to ask you," Hilliard went on imperturbably, 
"whether you will remove this fence, which
you have unlawfully placed around land which
belongs to another."</p>

<p>"No," roared Jellson, "I will not."</p>

<p>"The owners of this and other private property
fenced in by you and your men intend to compel
you by law to keep on your own land. In the
mean time, we mean to save our stock. You have
refused any consideration whatever to justice or
humanity. I have the honor to inform you that
your fences have been cut wherever they encroached
upon property belonging to other people&mdash;except
this one. And I now propose to cut this."</p>

<p>He leaped from his horse as he spoke, and began
coolly to handle the shears.</p>

<p>Jellson had preserved a contemptuous silence
throughout Hilliard's last speech. For a full second 
afterward he stood as if paralyzed by the
audacity of the whole proceeding. Then, with
another volley of oaths, he threw his gun to his
shoulder and fired. His hand, trembling with
rage, was unsteady; the shot flew wide of the
mark, spattering the post and digging into the
ground several feet to Hilliard's right.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot, boys!" Hilliard called over his
shoulder, hearing the beat of horses' hoofs behind
him.</p>

<p>Jellson jerked a pistol from his belt and fired
again. The bullet whistled past Hilliard's ear.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot, boys!" he cried again. The last

<!-- page 102 -->

strand of wire snapped in the sharp nippers,
sprang apart, and curled up with a whizzing sound.</p>

<p>Hilliard's foot was already in the stirrup; his
men had closed around him with a cheer. "Forward!" 
he cried gayly; and a moment later they
were flying across the prairie, shot after shot ringing, 
impotent, behind them.</p>

<p>"No, not a shot!" insisted the leader, as once
or twice his companions turned threateningly with
their hands on their pistols. "That last exploit
was pure bravado on my part," he added, laughing.
"I can't say that I am particularly proud of it!
But it may set Jellson to thinking, and things may
straighten out. In the mean time, the poor beasts
have had water. Of course the fences will be put
up again."</p>

<p>"And of course we'll cut 'em again," said
Roper.</p>

<p>VIII</p>

<p class="small">AN ARRIVAL</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning Hilliard was stirring early.
There was barely dawn-light enough when he
climbed into the stable-loft for him to find what
he wanted,&mdash;a broken bolt and a piece of tubing
which needed the blacksmith's craft; and the sky
was just throbbing with the first faint premonitions
of sunrise when he mounted his horse and rode
across his own bit of woodland toward the Branch
road. The tall flowering horse-mint, crushed beneath 
Hector's hoofs, filled the fresh air with a
homely, wholesome fragrance. The love-vine,
knotting its yellow links over the sumach bushes,
was threaded with shining globules; the post-oak
leaves, brushing his cheek with their rough, wet
surfaces, filliped the woodsy dew into his eyes.
There was a pleasant twitter of birds among the
treetops. He bared his head and hummed a half-remembered 
tune; then he sang lustily a fragment
of the old ditty which Miss Wingate had sung for
him the night before:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"When from my window-pane<br/>

I look on night again,<br/>

I still am lonely, my love, mine only."</p>

</blockquote>

<!-- page 104 -->

<p>The melancholy refrain had nothing in common
with Helen Wingate, in the full flush of her beautiful 
young womanhood&mdash;nor with him!</p>

<p>For life was at high tide with Leroy Hilliard
that June morning. He glanced back as he repeated 
the last phrase of the song, "My love, mine
only." He could see, down a lengthening vista of
the woods, a corner of his larger field, the zigzag
rail fence and the clean well-grown cotton, beyond.
His house was not visible, but the joyous barking
of dogs indicated its whereabouts, and he knew as
well as if they were under his eyes how old Manuel 
at that moment was stalking, stiff and taciturn
as a Spanish hidalgo, to his day's work, with
Juan, hoe on shoulder, chattering like a brown
young monkey at his heels.</p>

<p>He touched the breast-pocket of his light woolen
blouse, where Mrs. Blackmore's last letter, full of
affectionate encouragement and brimming with delightful 
home news, kept guard over some crisp
bank-notes. The ride to Skipton for the purpose
of sending home that first sum of money had been
anticipated for weeks with an almost boyish eagerness. 
To-day, the very motion of his spirited
horse under him filled him with joy. He recalled
with keen satisfaction the rousing cheer which
greeted Jack Ransome's account at Crouch's, the
preceding afternoon, of his, Hilliard's, successful
leadership of the fence-cutters, and of his dramatic
"interview" under fire with the superintendent,
Jellson. A pleasant sense of power, not unmixed

<!-- page 105 -->

with self-gratulation, pervaded his being. To this
was added a delicious quickening of his pulses
before a mental vision of a pair of violet-blue eyes,
long-lashed, tender, beautiful. They seemed to
smile upon him, to beckon him on. "My love, mine
only," he sang, flushing consciously in the solitude
of the forest. Yes, life was at high tide with him!</p>

<p>He emerged from the post-oak rough into his
unfenced prairie pasture. The morning light had
grown stronger, the eastern horizon was reddening;
the grass, which after the long drought hardly retained 
a vestige of green, was already alive with
grasshoppers jumping incessantly and aimlessly
about; Hector recoiled with a frightened snort
from a centipede&mdash;a brilliant span of yellow,
brown, and red&mdash;crawling across the bridle-path.
"Steady, old boy," admonished his rider. "Hello!
what's in the wind!" His eye had been caught
by some cattle who were pawing the ground and
lowing excitedly near one end of the small prairie.
They scattered at his approach, and peering down
from his saddle, he saw that the trampled ground,
elsewhere parched and cracked with the heat, was
here moist; the grass about this particular spot
was fresh and green. He could follow by this
agreeable verdure the course of what was probably
a hitherto unsuspected underground spring. The
shallow depression dipped a few paces away into
a wide, deep hollow between some bluff-like knolls,
whence the ground fell off toward Mesquit Creek,
whose bed was now dry as a bone.</p>

<!-- page 106 -->

<p>"There is certainly water here, and the cattle,
as usual, have discovered it," Hilliard mused as
he rode on.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ransome's house stood near the Branch
road, about four miles from Hilliard's farm. It
was a low, weather-beaten, peak-roofed structure,
sitting comfortably in the midst of an ample yard.
The wide gallery was shaded by a giant jack-bean
purple with bloom and thick with honey-gathering
bees. A row of hollyhocks intermixed with petunias 
and ragged-robin bordered the walk to the
front gate. There was an orchard back of the
house; the fruit-trees had the gnarled and knotty
look of age. Both house and orchard were, in
fact, older than any other work of white man on
Mesquit Creek. Mr. Ransome, now dead, had
taken precedence even over Uncle Joe Wyatt as
a briar-breaker, being among those settlers in the
county who had heard the savage yells of the Comanche, 
and gazed on the shaggy heads of the last
of the buffaloes. They were thrifty folk, the Ransomes, 
with ideas of comfort and convenience not
common at that time in the settlement, and Ransome's 
had been for many years regarded as the
likeliest place on Mesquit.</p>

<p>Hilliard could not forbear turning into the Peleg 
road, which passed directly in front of the
house. Jack Ransome, hearing the sound of
a horse's feet, came out of the stable. "Hullo,
Roy," he cried, his ruddy young face lighting with
pleasure. " 'Light, and come in."</p>

<!-- page 107 -->

<p>"No," returned Hilliard, secretly longing to
accept the invitation. "No, I must get over to
Skipton and back before noon. Besides, it is too
early."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Jack, resting his arms lazily on the
fence. "Everybody's up. We've had breakfast,
long ago. I am hooking up a team to drive mother 
over to Mrs. Crouch's to spend the day.
Better 'light."</p>

<p>"No." Hilliard glanced again at the house,
where he heard, the sound of voices. "No," he
repeated resolutely, gathering up his bridle-reins.
"I may stop as I come back," he added, his heart
already leaping forward to the noontide halt in the
leafy shadow of the flowering-bean, with&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>He found himself, almost before he knew it,
nearing the spot where the day before the cedar
post had been uprooted and flung aside, and he
himself had cut the first strands of fence-wire.
An hour had passed since he had left Jack Ransome 
at his gate. The sun was already hot, the
black dust whirled in clouds from under Hector's
feet. The wide, treeless plain looked dreary and
desolate under the vivid blue sky. Innumerable
buzzards hovered in the air, rising slowly from
their disgusting feast, opening and closing their
great black wings, and settling again upon the
heaps of half-picked bones. The sight grated
upon Hilliard's high-strung nerves; he dug his
spurs unconsciously in Hector's sides and jerked
the bridle-bit. The horse sprang forward a length

<!-- page 108 -->

or two, then he swerved to the side of the road,
and reared so suddenly that his rider was nearly
unseated. Recovering himself in an instant, Hilliard 
soothed the trembling animal with voice and
hand. At the same time, a glance ahead showed
him a man lying directly across the road, motionless 
and apparently dead, his face upturned
and ghastly white in the sunlight. A horse saddled 
and bridled was standing a few paces beyond.
Hilliard leaped to the ground and ran forward.
As he knelt beside the prostrate figure his knee
sank into a pool of blood. A hasty examination
convinced him that the man&mdash;a stranger to himself&mdash;was 
not dead, but had fainted, probably
from loss of blood. His face, lacerated by the
barbed wire dragged across it, had bled profusely;
the fair hair was clotted with blood and dust; one
arm was thrown out, the hand clutching the dry
grass; the other, twisted under him, had bled at
the shoulder; a rent in the coat sleeve showed the
riven flesh. In the barbed wire which coiled
around his neck and shoulders like a steel spring
and trailed off to where the horse was standing,
Hilliard read the story. The horse had doubtless
stumbled in the loose wire carelessly left in the
road by the fence-cutters, then reared, in an effort
to disentangle himself; the rider, taken unaware,
had pitched forward and fallen heavily into the
mass of quivering wire.</p>

<p>Hilliard rubbed the slender wrists, white and
delicate as a woman's, and chafed the fair forehead, 

<!-- page 109 -->

noting as he did so the extreme beauty of
the pallid face. A tremor of returning life soon
ran along the graceful limbs. He forced a few
drops of brandy from his own traveling flask between 
the man's set teeth; in a few moments his
heavy eyelids slowly lifted and his blue eyes rolled
about with a dazed expression. But as Hilliard
attempted to move him, he uttered a sharp cry.
"I think my arm must be broken," he murmured
faintly.</p>

<p>It took Hilliard some time, working with infinite 
patience and gentleness, to extricate him from
the jagged and dangerous wire. The left arm,
upon examination, proved to be broken between
the wrist and elbow; the shoulder, torn by the
wire, was also dislocated. Tearing the sufferer's
linen coat into strips, he improvised sling and
bandages, and knotted his own handkerchief about
the forehead, which continued to bleed freely.</p>

<p>This done, he drew the fatal wire clear of the
road, and stood for a while looking anxiously in
every direction for possible help. There was no
one in sight. He returned to the disabled man
with an air of decision. "Do you think," he
asked, kneeling again beside him, "if I lift you
into the saddle, do you think you can ride? I
must get you out of the sun and to some place
where your arm can be set, and these cuts attended
to."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes." The stranger sat up bravely, making 
a visible effort to control himself. "Of course

<!-- page 110 -->

I can ride. I was going"&mdash;The words ended
in an involuntary groan. He sank back.</p>

<p>"Don't talk," said Hilliard kindly, "and don't
try to move. We shall manage somehow." He
whistled; Hector, grazing a few rods away, trotted
up, his beautiful young head lifted, his eyes shining.</p>

<p>"I am going to put you on my own horse," Hilliard 
continued, slipping his arm carefully under
his companion's shoulders and rising to his feet
with him, an almost helpless burden in his arms.
"I know that his gait is easy. Yours"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, he's not mine. He's a Skipton treasure."
The stranger steadied himself with an effort in the
saddle. A gleam of humor played over his pale
face. "And he trots like a pile-driver."</p>

<p>The ride seemed almost interminable to Hilliard. 
He guided the two horses with one hand,
while with his free arm he supported his charge,
who had become feverish and slightly delirious.
He was obliged to stop again and again to adjust
the sling, or moisten the trembling lips with
brandy. The morning was far advanced when he
finally reached Mrs. Ransome's gate. "Miss
Margaret," he called in a quiet tone. There was
a surprised movement behind the vines on the gallery; 
he caught a fleeting glimpse of two girlish
figures. One of them instantly appeared on the
step. "Oh, Mr. Hilliard, what is it? Who is
hurt?" cried Margaret Ransome, running bare-headed 
down the walk.</p>

<!-- page 111 -->

<p>"Do not be frightened. It is nothing serious,"
returned Hilliard. He had already dismounted
and taken the unconscious man in his arms, and
was pushing open the gate with his knee. He
explained the situation hurriedly as he passed up
the walk. The girl, flying ahead of him, led the
way into her mother's room, where he laid his
patient on the bed, and began at once to loosen
the improvised bandages, and tear away the bloody
shirtsleeve. Margaret brought a basin of water,
linen cloths, and home-made ointments; and assisted 
with deft and quiet hands in the operation
of setting the broken arm, and in dressing the
wounds made by the barbed wire. She paled now
and then, but followed Hilliard's directions bravely.</p>

<p>They were both unskilled in surgery, but the
shoulder was finally pulled in place, the broken
arm set and splinted, the blood and mire washed
from the matted hair and the pale face, and the
bandaged head laid back on big, white pillows.
Hilliard, blood-stained and dusty, with uprolled
sleeves, and an unwonted expression of fatigue
about him, stood looking down at the face on the
pillow. It was a very beautiful face,&mdash;blond
and delicate and spirituelle. The white brow
was shaded by curling hair, absolutely golden in
color; the eyebrows, the long, upturned lashes,
and the light mustache drooping over the handsome 
mouth&mdash;which seemed made for smiles&mdash;were 
a shade darker; the hands crossed on the
breast were exquisitely moulded, long and slender,

<!-- page 112 -->

with tapering fingers,&mdash;the hand of a girl, yet
conveying somehow an idea of strength.</p>

<p>"He seems very young. I wonder who he is,"
mused the watcher. He turned at the sound of
light footfalls on the bare floor. Margaret, who
had gone out a moment before carrying basin,
towels, and stained bandages, had re&euml;ntered.
Helen Wingate was with her; an involuntary
thrill stirred Hilliard's pulses at sight of her.</p>

<p>This was suddenly arrested by the look which
overspread her face. She had paused at the foot
of the bed; a vivid blush flooded her brow and
cheek. She drew back with a surprised exclamation.</p>

<p>"You know him?" demanded Hilliard quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;he&mdash;they are neighbors of ours in Kentucky. 
His mother lives quite near us. His name
is Allan Deerford."</p>

<p>Hilliard's brows contracted in a sudden effort
of memory; the furrow on his forehead deepened;
the scarlet line, as always when he was under the
influence of painful emotion, leaped along his left
cheek. "Where have I heard that name? What
have I to do with Deerford? <i>Deerford!</i> <i>Deerford!</i>" 
These inward questionings, which proved
fruitless, passed like a flash of lightning through
his brain.</p>

<p>At the same moment Allan Deerford opened his
eyes&mdash;blue as forget-me-nots.</p>

<p>It would be difficult for a man coming out of a
swoon to find awaiting his first bewildered glance

<!-- page 113 -->

a fairer picture than that presented by the two
young women standing at the foot of the bed
whereon Deerford was lying. Their pretty heads
were close together, their arms were intertwined.
The contrast between the two types of beauty
heightened the charm of both. Both girls were
tall and slender, and exquisitely proportioned.
Helen Wingate was wonderfully fair; a wild-rose
color in her cheeks and the deep scarlet of her lips
gave her oval face a vividness almost belied by
the gravity and luminous softness of her dark violet 
eyes. A mass of reddish brown hair waved
away from her low brow, and from the loose,
heavy coil on the nape of her neck little strands
escaped, to lie like rings of burnished copper
against her white skin. There was an air of repose 
about her slow, almost majestic, movements,
which seemed hardly in keeping with the airy and
winning grace of her manner, and the joyousness
of her speech and laughter. A little pale from
a recent illness when she first arrived from her
home in Kentucky, on a visit to her friend and
classmate, she now bloomed with radiant and
buoyant health.</p>

<p>Margaret Ransome's skin had the delicate transparent 
whiteness of a yucca bloom; her long-lashed
eyes were gray. Her abundant hair was intensely
black, perfectly straight, and so long that it fell
when unbound far below her knees. Her features
were irregular, but of a cameo-like fineness; her
voice was soft, but singularly clear and penetrating. 

<!-- page 114 -->

Lithe but vigorous, she seemed surrounded
by an atmosphere of vitality.</p>

<p>But it was not upon this rare and gracious picture 
that Allan Deerford's eyes first fell. They
opened full upon Hilliard's face. Pain and delirium 
had hitherto prevented him from taking
note of his deliverer. He now seemed to see him
for the first time. He frowned. His fair face
clouded. He also struggled with some dim, intangible, 
antagonistic memory.</p>

<p>The two brothers, each utterly unknown to the
other, gazed at one another silently for a long
second.</p>

<p>Then Deerford's eyes wandered, and opened
wide with surprise. "Miss Helen!" he cried joyfully, 
attempting to rise. The sudden movement
wrenched from him a suppressed groan. "Ah, I
had forgotten," he said. "What a hole you
pulled me out of, to be sure!" He turned his
glance gratefully on Hilliard, the momentary distrust 
vanishing. "I don't know where I would
have been by this time, but for you!"</p>

<p>Hilliard's face had also cleared. "I was in
honor bound to look after you," he said smiling,
"since I was indirectly the cause of your mishap."
He explained, without going into detail, the wire-cutting 
of the previous day.</p>

<p>Deerford's fall, it appeared, had occurred precisely 
as Hilliard had conjectured. He had left
Skipton before sunrise, and must therefore have
been lying unconscious in the road some time before 

<!-- page 115 -->

Hilliard's timely arrival. He remembered
nothing after his fall and the sharp prick of the
wire on his forehead, until he opened his eyes to
the face bending over him, and felt the painful
rush of renewed life through his veins. "I should
certainly have bled to death if you had not found
me," he concluded.</p>

<p>"Oh, somebody else would have happened along.
It is a traveled road," said Hilliard hastily.
"You will have to keep quiet for a few days," he
added. "But you will soon be on your feet
again."</p>

<p>Miss Wingate, who had recovered from her
momentary embarrassment, here interposed with
formal introductions. This ceremony ended, she
asked, "When did you leave The Bluffs, Mr.
Deerford?"</p>

<p>"Oh, about three weeks ago. I stopped at
several places <i>en route</i>. I came out to see about
some property&mdash;some disputed property&mdash;I have
somewhere around here." There was an undertone 
in the speaker's voice&mdash;mocking or malicious
&mdash;which did not escape Hilliard's sensitive ear.
Deerford had looked with smiling boldness at
Helen as he spoke. She dropped her eyes, and the
color in her cheeks deepened.</p>

<p>"I hope you have not come as a fresh 'bob-'wire 
emissary," said Margaret gayly. "But your
home-news must wait, Helen. I think our patient
had best stop talking now, and sleep if he can, or
he will be having fever in downright earnest. He

<!-- page 116 -->

may have a plate of chicken broth presently.
Oh," as a hungry protest came laughingly from
the patient himself&mdash;"if you think my reign a
tyranny, wait until you fall under my mother's
iron despotism! She will take possession of you
this afternoon the moment she returns. Come,
Helen."</p>

<p>The girls withdrew. Deerford fell almost instantly 
into a profound slumber. Hilliard remained 
by the bedside, watching him. His own
vague uneasiness had returned. He wrestled with
it manfully, looking down on the youthful face
which in sleep had lost the disingenuous expression
which alone marred its expression. But the feeling 
remained in spite of his resolution.</p>

<p>"The fellow has come to Texas for the sole purpose 
of seeing her, confound him," he said to himself, 
as he rode homeward late that afternoon.
"And I may as well admit to myself at once that
<i>that</i> is the ground of my prejudice! I wonder if
she"&mdash;he paused, not wishing even to frame the
thought. But he sighed; he found himself curiously 
tired and out of sorts. A jarring note had
somehow disturbed the harmony to which, a few
hours earlier, all his being was set; a discomfort
hitherto unknown to him in all his vigorous,
healthy life pervaded his mind and his body.
"What is the matter with me!" he exclaimed
aloud. "Have I so little backbone that I go into
a jelly at the mere sight of a little yellow whipper-snapper 
from the States? Ho! ho!" He pulled

<!-- page 117 -->

himself together, and his cheery laugh rang through
the silent woods and came echoing back. Hector
pricked up his ears and moved forward with a
lighter step, as if he, too, had shaken off some
invisible burden. Suddenly he threw up his head
and neighed softly. "Not another Kentucky rival,
I beseech you, Hector," said Hilliard whimsically.
Hector neighed again, trotted on a few paces, and
stopped still.</p>

<p>"Hey, boy! Hi, boy!" The voice came from
a clump of sumach by the roadside. Hilliard
recognized it before its owner lifted his long length
from the ground, and laid a hand on the horse's
glistening neck. "How do you do, Mr. Croft,"
he said in a cordial tone.</p>

<p>Abner Croft was a tall, thin, shambling fellow,
with bent shoulders, who, at a glance, looked
twice his thirty years. Close observation revealed,
however, the powerful muscles of youth, and the
bone and sinew of an athlete. There was something 
uncanny about his appearance. Superstitious 
people were afraid of his pale blue eyes,
which pierced, they said, like a brad-awl from
under their stiff, shaggy eyebrows. But, as is
often the case with a certain sort of terrifying and
mysterious folks, children and animals were fascinated 
by him. These, by the way, have apparently 
no sense of what we call beauty,&mdash;that fairness 
and proportion of form and feature which
makes the exterior attractive, and by which we,
confessedly, are sometimes deceived. The dog

<!-- page 118 -->

following his hunchbacked master with inexhaustible 
devotion; the child pressing its blooming
cheek to a scarred and withered bosom, or cooing
caressingly into a monstrous black face&mdash;such
things prove that there is a subtle divination in
unsophisticated creatures which reaches beneath
the envelope of flesh and finds something which
more perverted eyes cannot see.</p>

<p>Hector, whom he had bred from a colt and sold
to his present master, ran to Croft always upon
sight, and found him when his presence was unknown 
to others.</p>

<p>Croft was the chimney-builder, the well-digger,
and the grave-digger of Crouch's Settlement. He
held a pick in his hand now, as he stood on the
roadside; a long dogwood switch denuded of its
leaves was stuck in the band of his ragged wool
hat.</p>

<p>"Have you been looking for water, Mr. Croft?"
asked Hilliard, glancing at the switch.

"No," Croft returned, with a quick upward
scowl, as if ready to resent any approach at jocularity 
on the subject. Seeing the soberness of the
young man's face, he added, "I've been diggin'
a well over at Red Parsons's. His old one has
gone plum dry. It's cur'us, Mr. Hilliard, how
water acks in this county, dryin' up in one place,
an' breakin' out all to onct in another. Now
that there well of Tip Elliott's&mdash;seventy feet
deep. I dug it myse'f. Water ez good ez
Crouch's, ef not better. An' plenty of it. Well,

<!-- page 119 -->

sir, whenever the north wind blows, that well of
Tip Elliott's goes dry. What do you make of
that, out'n yo' schoolin', Mr. Hilliard?"</p>

<p>Hilliard answered absently. It was not the
first time Croft had commented on the phenomenon 
and asked his opinion. "Abner," he broke
out abruptly, "would you mind stepping over to
my prairie pasture with me? It isn't far, you
know. Have you time?"</p>

<p>"Why, cert'ny," returned the well-digger, looking 
pleased. "I've got all time. I was jest
loafin' along, so's not to get home afore night-time. 
Old Ma'am Croft might put me to churnin', 
or sompn." He winked slyly to himself. Old
Ma'am Croft was his mother, to whom he was
known to be very devoted.</p>

<p>Hilliard dismounted, and the two men walked
on together, Hector following at a little distance
like a pleased dog. There was no further conversation. 
Croft, used to being shunned by his
neighbors, and to holding himself aloof from them,
had an uneasy look at finding himself actually
alongside of one of them. His brief talks with
Hilliard had heretofore been held in passing, as it
were, and with that gentleman astride of Hector.
A half hour or so of brisk tramping brought them
to the small prairie set like a treeless island in the
heart of the surrounding rough.</p>

<p>The little bunch of cattle were gathered as before 
near the edge of the slope falling away to the
creek. They retired slowly as the two men came

<!-- page 120 -->

up. "What do you make of this, Mr. Croft?"
demanded Hilliard, indicating the moist hollow.
"An underground spring?"</p>

<p>Abner had taken the dogwood switch from his
hat-band and held it thoughtfully in his hand. "I
don't know," he said, with a doubtful sidewise look
at the questioner. "Looks like it. This here is a
funny country. Water is all the time wellin' down
in one place, an' wellin' up in another."</p>

<p>"Try the switch," suggested Hilliard, in good
faith.</p>

<p>Croft nodded, and stepped back without a word
to the knoll above the depression. He placed the
butt end of the switch against his breast, holding
it in place with the thumb and forefinger of his
left hand. He walked steadily forward, stepped
across the band of green grass, and turned a pace
or two to the right. The flexible end of the
switch dipped suddenly downward, sprung up, and
dipped again almost imperceptibly. "There's
water," said the diviner carelessly over his shoulder, 
"but not over an' above much of it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Hilliard, secretly convinced that
he was mistaken in his last statement, "I have
been thinking that if there is water here, what a
fine tank we could have. You see this hollow;"
he paused to tilt back his straw hat and thrust his
hand into his pocket for his handkerchief. At
sight of the blood stains on the square of linen&mdash;for 
the handkerchief had served as a bandage for
Deerford's forehead&mdash;Croft uttered a hoarse cry,

<!-- page 121 -->

and leaped backward. His eyes were terror-stricken; 
he trembled from head to foot. "Why,
Abner," exclaimed Hilliard, amazed, running to
him, "What is the matter? Are you sick? Are
you hurt?"</p>

<p>"No, no," stammered the man, turning his face
aside. "Don't mind it, Mr. Hilliard," he continued, 
setting his teeth together impatiently. "It's
the blood. I can't help it. They say that my
father was killed under my mother's eyes jest afore
I was born. She ain't never spoke of it to me,
pore little creeter. But I reckin it's that. I dunno. 
It plum skeers me into fits to see blood, or
a corpse. An' me a grave-digger by perfession.
That's why I do it. I'm wrastlin' with that
white liver o' mine. An' I'll down it, or die!"</p>

<p>"Give me your hand on it, Mr. Croft," said
Hilliard, touched by a confidence which the reticent 
man had never offered to any one before.
He grasped the horny hand held out to him,
warmly, and affected not to notice Croft's emotion.
"You see this hollow," he proceeded, as if there
had been no interruption. "Don't you think by
throwing a dam yonder, and another here," indicating 
two gaps in the deep natural basin below
the slope, "that we can get a fine head of water?"</p>

<p>"Cert'ny," responded Croft promptly. "I don't
think you'll get it from the onderground spring,"
he added honestly. "But you make the dam, an'
one of our hell-roarin' rains&mdash;ef we ever git one
ag'in&mdash;'d fill her chuck full. It's a good idee,

<!-- page 122 -->

Mr. Hilliard. Then I s'pose you'd fence in yo'
paster."</p>

<p>"Eh? Why, no, of course not," said Hilliard.
"I propose to have water enough to water all the
cattle around here&mdash;at least all the home-cattle&mdash;until 
this wire fence outrage is abolished."</p>

<p>"Lord, Mr. Hilliard," muttered Abner, gazing
at him quizzically, "the fool-killer is cert'ny layin'
fer sech as you!"</p>

<p>"Can you "&mdash;began Hilliard.</p>

<p>"Cert'ny," interrupted Croft, "I'll take the
job. I ain't got nothin' to do. I'll git Red 'n'
Green Parsons's children to he'p gether rocks,
'n'&mdash;you jest leave it to me, Roy, I'll commence
termorrer. But you ain't goin' to git over an'
above much water out'n this onderground spring,"
he concluded obstinately. "You'll have to wait
for a hell-roarin' rain."</p>

<p>"All right," laughed Hilliard. "The rain will
do&mdash;if it ever comes. Come over to my house in
the morning, and get what you need. I'll send
Juan with a mule and cart back with you."</p>

<p>He shook hands again with the digger, who
shouldered his pick and trudged away. Then he
mounted and rode home through the waning light.</p>

<p>"Deerford. <i>Deerford</i>," he mused, tossing sleeplessly 
on his bed that night. "Where have I
heard that name! And this stranger&mdash;pshaw,
why do I think of him? What have I to do with
him, or he with me?"</p>

<p>What indeed!</p>

<p>IX</p>

<p class="small">THE WATER-TANK</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A week</span> passed before Hilliard saw his friends,
the Ransomes, or the newcomer, Allan Deerford,
again. His crop was nominally laid by, but the
weeds and the tie-vines, which flourished in spite
of the long-continued drought, demanded unremitting 
attention. He took his place, as usual,
by Manuel's side, hoe in hand, under the blistering 
sun, while Juan hauled stone and earth for
Abner Croft at the new water-tank. He did not
go to Crouch's for his mail, and the remittance
for Mrs. Blackmore still waited to be forwarded
from Skipton; the unmended bolt had been cast
aside. Rumors reached him, through Croft and
others, of fresh complications arising from the
barbed wire which was still creeping like a steel
centipede across the prairies; but he learned that
Jellson had at least left Crawls's Water-hole open
to the cattle, and this important concession was,
he thought, all that could be expected at the
moment.</p>

<p>He avoided as much as possible the thought of
Deerford, whose very name aroused undefinably
unpleasant sensations; he heard no mention of the

<!-- page 124 -->

man, and he conjectured that he had left the neighborhood. 
He had no mind, however, to banish
from his thoughts the vision of Helen Wingate
which hovered star-like and lovely over his sleeping 
and waking dreams. She was the first woman
who had come to stir the inner depths of his nature. 
He had been singularly free from even the
callow and fleeting affairs considered inseparable
from the schoolboy and young collegian period of
life.</p>

<p>An electric shock had thrilled him when, riding
slowly along the Peleg road one day in the early
spring, his head bent in deep meditation, he looked
up and found himself face to face with a stranger&mdash;a 
young girl&mdash;also on horseback. She was
alone, and had approached so quietly, her horse's
hoofs falling lightly on the deep sand, that she
had upon his startled senses almost the effect of
an apparition from another world. She wore a
close-fitting habit of gray cloth, ornamented with
brass buttons; a wide black-plumed gray hat
shaded her brow, and a pair of long gauntlets of
undressed leather covered her hands. Hilliard's
heart leaped. A swift but vivid memory of a
commanding figure in Confederate gray uniform,
with proud face and deep, tender eyes, swam between 
him and the beautiful young stranger
mounted on Jack Ransome's bay filly. Recovering 
his self-possession, he had barely time to lift
his hat courteously and give the road, for the girl,
touching her horse lightly with her whip, had

<!-- page 125 -->

darted past him, and was already disappearing.
He could not at once define his feeling for Helen
Wingate, whose acquaintance he immediately
sought. He had a passionate desire to serve her,
as if in return for some inestimable act of grace to
himself. "For just condescending to live and be,
I suppose," he laughed to himself with a fullness
as of tears in his throat. This exalted worship
continued, remaining a thing apart, in the midst
of the overwhelming but explicable love of a man
for the woman whom he wishes to make his wife.
The latter feeling came more slowly&mdash;yet it was
not long in coming.</p>

<p>He had seen her almost daily, for Jack Ransome, 
younger than himself by several years, was
one of the earliest friends he had made in the settlement, 
and Mrs. Ransome and Margaret stood
almost in the relation of mother and sister to him.
He had not put his fate to the final test; he had
been restrained from this step by several reasons,
chief among them being the knowledge, accidentally 
acquired, that Miss Wingate, the only child
of a widowed mother, was heir to great wealth.
A sense of delicacy, moreover, forbade him to
press his suit while she was absent from her own
home. He had determined to follow her there and
demand permission to woo her frankly and openly.
He had so far thought himself, if not secure, at
least not in danger of formidable rivalry. Now,
a competitor had appeared. He might banish the
fair face of that competitor from his mind, but

<!-- page 126 -->

the rival was no less in the field. "I shall not
wait," he now decided. "I cannot afford to wait."
His self-conflict and very desire to settle the matter
once for all had as much to do as the needs of his
cotton crop with his absence from Mrs. Ransome's
during the week following Deerford's arrival.
It went far, also, toward explaining his feverish
activity in the construction of the water-tank.</p>

<p>This work had progressed rapidly. Croft, who
developed unexpected engineering talent, had gone
beyond Hilliard's original simple scheme. The
dam was really a fine piece of rough masonry,&mdash;a 
rock wall carefully cemented, and protected by
a wide embankment of earth, inclosed the outer
and open side of the enlarged hollow, making a
pond-like basin. Easy approaches for the cattle
to the hoped-for supply of water were made. A
shaft was sunk and water found, though as the
experienced well-digger had predicted, in no great
quantity, at the head of the moist grass-lined depression 
on the prairie; from this shaft, a rude
pipe had been laid to the basin, and both shaft
and pipe were well covered with earth to prevent
injury by the trampling cattle.</p>

<p>When Hilliard at the end of the week made his
usual daily visit, he found Abner leaning on his
spade and surrounded by a ragged battalion composed 
of Red Parsons's boys and their cousins, the
Green Parsons girls&mdash;all as hardy and handy at
rock-gathering as at cotton-picking or coon-hunting. 
A thin stream of water from the pipe trickled 

<!-- page 127 -->

down the upper side of the tank; and a small
pool continually soaking into the dry earth, and as
often renewed, showed on the bottom. Abner
received Hilliard's thanks and congratulations with
becoming modesty. "I think she's a fair job,
myse'f," he admitted. "But you'll have to stretch
a wire fence around the tank, Mr. Hilliard, to
give the water a chanct. Ef you don't, the cattle'll 
be tumblin' over the eedge after that cupful
o' water down there. There won't be no water
wo'th talking about no-how ontil we get a hell-roarin' 
rain. Then you kin take down the fence
an' turn her loose. You'll have a tank that'll
set the settlement to shoutin' hallelujah."</p>

<p>He readily undertook the further business of
putting a temporary fence around the tank. "Step
lively, gals," he cried gayly, as Hilliard rode off,
for the Red Parsonses, at the suggestion of more
work, had sneaked to the creek bottom. "Step
lively, an' he'p dig these post-holes."</p>

<p>A new element had come into Abner Croft's
lonely and colorless life with that first hearty and
sympathetic handshake from Leroy Hilliard. His
peculiarities, real and imagined, had set him apart
from the open and expansive people around him.
He had lived among them more than a dozen
years, building their chimneys, digging their wells
and their graves, lending a hand at their house-raisings, 
and "yearning" (<i>i. e.</i> charming) their
children, but utterly aloof from themselves. His
mother&mdash;whom few in the settlement had ever

<!-- page 128 -->

seen, and who was vaguely understood to be a little
"cracked"&mdash;had hitherto been the sole grown-up
human being with whom he ever held voluntary
speech, except in the way of business. Even the
few words he had exchanged with Hilliard from
time to time in passing had been a matter of
wonder to himself. Now, in one moment a sealed
fountain had been opened, and Hilliard had become 
unwittingly an object of almost passionate
veneration to the "yearner." "Sompn inside me
busted loose when I seen the shine of his eyes that
day," he said long afterward to Margaret Ransome, 
"sompn cert'ny busted loose."</p>

<p>Strange to say, Margaret understood this obscure 
explanation.</p>

<p>Some days after the water-tank was pronounced
finished, Hilliard rode to Skipton and transacted
his interrupted business there. He passed a corner 
of Mrs. Ransome's place after daybreak; he
could see a flutter of white dresses in the garden;
he fancied he heard the echo of girlish laughter,
but he galloped stolidly on, not even turning his
head. He made a circuit on the open prairie to
avoid the spot where he had found Deerford&mdash;this, 
however, under pretense of examining Jellson's 
new line of wire. His satisfaction in finding 
the water-hole still open to the cattle helped
to dissipate a slight bitterness which for several
days had been stealing into his soul. "As if anything 
could be wrong!" he exclaimed in a tone of
self-reproach. "I will stop on my way back."</p>

<!-- page 129 -->

<p>About mid-afternoon he drew rein at Mrs.
Ransome's gate. The thought came back to him
in spite of himself as he dismounted, that Jack
Ransome had not crossed his threshold for nearly
a fortnight. Such a thing had not happened before 
since he had settled on Mesquit Creek. Jack
Ransome, sitting on his porch, sprawling on his
home-made lounge, Jack smoking his pipes and
roaring over his comic newspaper-weeklies, Jack
borrowing his guns, or sitting at the foot of his
dinner-table&mdash;he had not until now realized how
large a part of his daily life the lad had become,
for Jack, though twenty years old, was but a great
boisterous affectionate boy. He felt an unwonted
embarrassment as he strode up the flower-bordered
walk to the house. His approach had evidently
been unnoted. He paused at the foot of the
steps, and stood there&mdash;it seemed to him a long
time, before any one observed him. Deerford
was sitting in a large rocking-chair; his arm was
still in a sling, but his face had regained its
healthy color, and the wounds on his temple had
healed. He looked bright and joyous. Helen
Wingate's guitar lay across his knees, and he
swept his right hand occasionally across the strings
to emphasize the story he was telling. The two
girls, side by side on a bench, were leaning forward 
eagerly. Jack sat on a low stool, literally
at the stranger's feet. Mrs. Ransome, in the
shadow of the vines, had dropped her sewing in
her lap, and was listening. "And so," concluded

<!-- page 130 -->

Deerford gayly, "L'Eclair won by a couple of
lengths, proving that&mdash;like the family doctor&mdash;a
good jockey drunk is better than a poor one sober."</p>

<p>Margaret Ransome drew back, a distinct shade
of disapprobation crossing her expressive face.
She seemed about to speak. But Jack had caught
sight of Hilliard. "Hello, Roy," he cried, springing 
to his feet, "where did you drop from, old
man!"</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Hilliard," called Deerford
in the same breath! "Come in. Come in!" He
had, Hilliard thought afterward, quite the air of
a man doing the honors of his own house. At the
moment, however, in the passing of his own slight
embarrassment, this escaped his notice; he found
himself shaking hands all around as usual, and
responding lightly to Margaret Ransome's banter.</p>

<p>"Why haven't you been here!" she demanded.
"Where have you been keeping yourself? When
last heard of, you were in conference with the
silent and lugubrious Croft. We had about concluded 
that you had ordered your own grave, and
descended into it for a fixed period, like a self-resurrecting 
Mahatma."</p>

<p>"We have missed you, Roy," said Mrs. Ransome, 
with motherly gentleness.</p>

<p>Hilliard looked quickly at Helen; she was
absorbed in a half-whispered conversation with
Deerford. "Oh," he said, turning to Margaret,
"you bright-winged butterflies that flit from ear
to ear&mdash;of corn, for a brief season only, cannot

<!-- page 131 -->

understand how a cotton-grub has to toil. I can
show you the regulation July hoe-handle blisters
on my horny palms."</p>

<p>"We have heard about your new water-tank,"
said Margaret, suddenly serious. "It is a beautiful 
idea"&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are setting up as a public philanthropist,
for man and beast, eh, Mr. Hilliard?" Deerford
broke in. The sneer in his voice was unmistakable, 
though he looked airily unconscious, swinging 
himself back and forth in the rocker.</p>

<p>Hilliard flushed and bit his lip. "For beasts
only, Mr. Deerford," he returned, looking full
into the speaker's face. But, ashamed in an instant 
of this brutal allusion to the service he had
rendered a helpless stranger, he continued without
showing the effort the words cost him, "you must
ride over as soon as you are able to do so, Mr.
Deerford, and inspect the Croft masterpiece&mdash;the
water-tank, which, by the way, has no water in it!
and spend a couple of weeks with me, or as long
as it may be agreeable to you to share my bachelor
quarters."</p>

<p>"Thanks." The sneer in Deerford's voice had
given place to a hardly veiled antagonism.</p>

<p>The others apparently had not caught the meaning 
of this slight passage-at-arms. It went no
further, for Jack Ransome broke in, "Able!
Shucks! He has already been on horseback several 
times. He rode over to Crouch's with the
girls yesterday morning and came home by way of

<!-- page 132 -->

Peleg Church. Allan stood the racket better than
any of us."</p>

<p><i>Allan!</i> Hilliard felt as if the earth were breaking 
under him, knocked to pieces by the slender
hand which he had warmed to life a bare fortnight
ago!</p>

<p>"And that reminds me, Roy," continued young
Ransome, "there is a meeting of the fence-cutters
called for to-morrow. At Crouch's. Ten o'clock.
I promised Billy and Uncle Joe Wyatt that I
would ride by your place yesterday and notify you.
But I forgot it. Allan and I are going early."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Deerford lazily. "I want to study
the barbed-wire controversy&mdash;and the natives."</p>

<p>"Take care! The natives may do some studying 
in return." Hilliard thought he detected some
sarcasm in Margaret's shot, and he glanced gratefully 
at her. He had arisen to go, feeling oddly
out of place in the familiar group.</p>

<p>"Why, Roy," remonstrated Mrs. Ransome,
"aren't you going to stay to dinner?"</p>

<p>"Of course you will, old fellow," cried Jack.</p>

<p>"You have not told us the Skipton news," urged
Margaret.</p>

<p>Again Hilliard cast a covert glance toward
Helen. She had hardly spoken at all during his
brief visit. She did not now lift her down-dropped
eyelids. Deerford kept his smiling face turned
toward hers, completely ignoring the debate.</p>

<p>"I must go," Hilliard said quietly, turning
away.</p>

<!-- page 133 -->

<p>"Be sure and meet us at Crouch's to-morrow,"
Jack called after him, not moving from his place.
Margaret walked beside him to the gate. He was
so blinded by anger, disappointment, wounded
pride,&mdash;a thousand conflicting emotions,&mdash;that
he did not even see her. She, on her part, could
think of nothing to say, though her heart was
throbbing with sympathy and indignation. Only,
at parting, she put out her firm white hand; he
clasped it in his own. And when the angry tumult
in his breast had a little subsided, he tried to remember 
what it was that had sent something like
a healing thrill along his bruised nerves.</p>

<br/>

<p>Crouch's Well presented a lively appearance
the next morning towards eleven o'clock. The
usual mail-day crowd was augmented by numbers of
men from outlying settlements, who were suffering
from the barbed-wire outrage; many of these had
brought their shotguns with them, and their belts
bristled with small arms. A dozen or more passing 
teamsters and drummers had stopped for the
meeting; and there were as many idlers from
Skipton and Rassler, who had come over, avowedly
to see the fun. Mrs. Crouch, making no pretense
of farm-work for the day, was already in the
kitchen with Lorena and the younger children;
the appetizing smell of frying bacon and boiling
coffee pervaded the air. Billy was in his glory.
He kept slipping from his place on the fence to
greet fresh arrivals; and he drew water from the

<!-- page 134 -->

well at a rate which left his round face purple and
his short arms limp. It may be remarked in
passing that Billy never dreamed of drawing water
for Mrs. Crouch.</p>

<p>Uncle Joe Wyatt was haranguing the crowd
when Hilliard rode up. Among the most attentive
and respectful listeners was Allan Deerford. He
looked very handsome and picturesque. He was
in his shirtsleeves. A light blue silk handkerchief, 
coquettishly knotted, served as a sling for
his left arm; it also served to intensify the clear
blue of his sparkling eyes. His white flannel
trousers were tucked into high boots and girdled
by a leather belt. In the latter he wore conspicuously 
a small dagger with an oddly-shaped silver
hilt. On the heels of his boots jingled a pair of
silver spurs. Many of the older men had grunted
disapproval when this dashing figure had galloped
up alongside of Jack Ransome; the younger ones,
sneering openly, secretly admired his theatrical
appearance.</p>

<p>"I hain't no call to palaver," concluded Mr.
Wyatt, "no more 'n to say, that bob-wire has been
wound worse 'n a spider-web th'oo an' th'oo this
county. Water has been shet in, an' cattle has
been shet out, as Roy Hilliard has explained nigh
a month ago. It gits mo' an' mo' aggravated
every day. That job o' wire-cuttin' was good as
far as it went. But 'tw'an't enough. Ef this
thing keeps on, there won't be a steer left in the
county."</p>

<!-- page 135 -->

<p>An angry murmur ran like a low growl of thunder 
along the fence.</p>

<p>"What's to be done, gentlemen? That's the
question. That's what we've met here ag'in to
<i>con</i>sider."</p>

<p>"Cut the wire! Cut the wire!"</p>

<p>"Drag the posts an' the d&mdash;d post-setters out
of the county."</p>

<p>"Blow the cussed agents into kingdom come."</p>

<p>"I'm ready to start, right now."</p>

<p>"So am I."</p>

<p>"And I."</p>

<p>"And I."</p>

<p>"Let's start with the wire across Burke's
prairie."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, boys. The captain has got
a word or two to say." This last sentence came
from Roper, who had been lounging against the
fence near where Hilliard sat. There was instant
cessation of noise.</p>

<p>"I wish to say, friends," said Hilliard, in a
quiet but emphatic tone, "that I think this is a
matter to be carefully considered. As I said at
our last meeting, wherever the wires are stretched
upon private property, or block public roads, we
have, according to my opinion, the right to protect
ourselves. I have already joined in one expedition
of this kind. I stand ready to do so again. But
we have no more right to destroy other people's
property than they have to destroy ours. To all
of the places just mentioned&mdash;begging your pardon, 

<!-- page 136 -->

Mr. Wyatt&mdash;I happen to know that the men
who have fenced in have acquired legal ownership.
Burke's prairie is a part of the Cottonwood Ranch.
I would suggest that"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I move we pull up every strange post and cut
every strand of new wire in the Settlement."</p>

<p>Everybody turned, amazed, at this interruption.
It came from Deerford. He had sprung upon the
half-empty water-trough and was standing in an
easy attitude, with his straw hat in his free hand,
and his blue eyes roving over the crowd.</p>

<p>"What the devil has that jack-in-the-box got to
do with it," growled Bagley.</p>

<p>This feeling was shared for one second by nearly
every man present. But Deerford had unquestionably 
struck the popular chord. A brief silence
was followed by a loud approving cheer.</p>

<p>"I know," continued Deerford gracefully, "that
I am a stranger&mdash;and thanks to this same barbed
wire&mdash;a lame one, at that. But this does not
keep me from seeing what is just and right. The
barbed-wire business from first to last is a damnable 
outrage. If it is allowed to go on, as the
last speaker has so justly and forcibly observed,
there will not be a steer left in the county,&mdash;neither 
beef-meat, milk-cow, or beast of burden! By
what right&mdash;I ask this of intelligent and high-minded 
citizens&mdash;by what right does the bloated
capitalist of the far north and the far east, with
his millions and his minions, dare to invade the
sacred homes and the inviolable birthright of the
poor, perhaps, but free and manly Texan?"</p>

<!-- page 137 -->

<p>The speaker was interrupted by wild and almost
savage yells of indorsement. With rare skill he
had found and played upon the dominant key of
the pioneer character,&mdash;an almost unreasoning
mistrust of the rich and a dread of his encroachment 
upon their rights.</p>

<p>"I am a stranger," he resumed when the applause 
had a little subsided, "but time will remedy
that, for I propose to cast in my lot with the people 
of Crouch's Settlement. Moreover, I claim
the right to lead a party this very night to riddle
the fence on Burke's prairie to atoms."</p>

<p>Bagley fairly gasped at the audacity of the
man. Hilliard had turned pale; the red line
shone like a sword-cut on his cheek. But his
voice was steady and his acknowledged influence
compelled attention as he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I beg to utter my protest against what Mr.
Deerford has just said. I think he is mistaken,
even if the matter be considered from the standpoint 
alone of public policy. And I claim no
right over any man's conscience,&mdash;but I for one
will not take part in setting an example of wanton
destruction of property which is not mine."</p>

<p>"Amen," said Bagley emphatically.</p>

<p>"I have already given my views on the subject
of night raids," continued Hilliard, "and I warn
those proposing to lead such that they will be
directly responsible for consequences probably
dangerous."</p>

<p>There was a dead, uneasy silence. Red Parsons 

<!-- page 138 -->

unwound his long legs from the rails where
he sat, got down and walked over to Hilliard and
stood by him in solemn allegiance. Bagley grinned
understandingly and moved up near them; Abner
Croft followed, dragging a long-handled pick after
him.</p>

<p>The others looked at each other, anxious and
uncertain.</p>

<p>"Meet me at nine o'clock to-night, on the Peleg
road, near Blackbird Gully." Deerford spoke
with assured authority. "And&mdash;down with the
wire-pullers!"</p>

<p>The phrase caught the fancy of his hearers; the
sentiment chimed but too well with their own exasperated 
feelings. "Down with the wire-pullers!"
The idlers joined lustily in the shout; even the
freighters, hitherto but mildly interested in the
proceedings, caught the contagion and cried,
"Down with the wire-pullers!"</p>

<p>"The signal for the start will be"&mdash;Deerford
interrupted himself, and looked around with affected 
apprehension. "I take it for granted,
gentlemen, that there are no informers present."
His glance rested as if by accident on Hilliard&mdash;"the 
signal, I repeat, will be two pistol-shots at
half past nine at Blackbird Gully on the Peleg
road. Do you agree, gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Hurrah for Deerford! Down with
the wires. Down with the wire-pullers!" A
frenzy of enthusiasm possessed the crowd. They
swarmed about the young stranger, shaking his

<!-- page 139 -->

hand, overwhelming him with compliments, and
showering invitations upon him.</p>

<p>Hilliard stood apart, wondering at the easy
grace with which he received this rough ovation,
wondering still more at the surprising quickness
with which he had become acquainted with the lay
of the neighborhood and its roads.</p>

<p>This knowledge in truth was superficial. Deerford 
possessed a certain alertness of mind, and a
trick of catching and weaving together floating
threads which, to an ordinary observer, had no
connection with each other. He had also a retentive 
memory, a natural fondness for adventure,
and great personal courage.</p>

<p>Rich, idle, and unscrupulous, he had in all his
life known but one really honest feeling. This
was his love for Helen Wingate. It had been his
avowed determination since his early boyhood to
make her his wife. Meantime, there were other
things to make life worth while! He had followed
her to Texas as much for the excitement to be had
in a semi-frontier neighborhood, as for the desire
to be near her. He had for years counted her as
already won, though he had not as yet committed
himself by open speech. Young, beautiful, and
rich, she had had many suitors. But in Hilliard
he had encountered the first rival who appeared to
him worth the unsheathing of his sword. Moved
less by jealousy than by an instinctive hatred, he
had drawn his weapon the very first day. Meantime, 
again, there were other things to make life

<!-- page 140 -->

worth while on Mesquit Creek! It was not opposition 
to Hilliard alone which had caused him to
propose himself as a leader of the fence-cutters.
Every fibre of his reckless nature tingled with
rapture at the prospect of the wild midnight raids,
the dash into probable danger, the quick doublings
and turnings on the homeward route, with the
baffled pursuer at his heels!</p>

<p>"To-night, boys," he cried at length, springing
on his horse without regard to his lame arm.
Hilliard noted with an angry pang that he was
riding Diana, the bay filly which had been sacred
to Helen ever since her arrival.</p>

<p>The first batch of diners were trooping into the
house, escorted by Billy. The belated teamsters
were watering their horses and getting ready to
move off. There was some trading of horses
among the idlers, and not a few small but lively
quarrels. Hilliard made his way through the
confusion to where Jack Ransome sat his horse,
gaping with admiration at Deerford.</p>

<p>"Jack," he began in a low voice. Young Ransome 
turned a reluctant face toward him. "Jack,
I want you to promise me that you will not go on
that raid to-night."</p>

<p>"The h&mdash;l you do," returned Jack, in genuine
astonishment. "I hope you don't think I'd miss
it. No, sir, not for a million!"</p>

<p>Hilliard lost control of himself a little. "Listen, 
Jack," he said impatiently. "The trouble is
this. Your friend Mr. Deerford"&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 141 -->

<p>"The trouble with you, Mr. Leroy Hilliard,"
interrupted Jack with boyish impertinence, "is
that you are jealous of my friend Mr. Deerford."</p>

<p>Hilliard drew back as if he had received a blow.
He turned Hector's head and rode away without
another word.</p>

<p>"Roy," said Red Parsons, riding up beside him,
in company with Bagley, "I'm a thousand times
er-bleedged to you for expressin' of them straight-out 
principles to-day. I seen 'em clear enough in
my mind whilst Uncle Joe Wyatt was jabberin',
but I couldn't of laid 'em off plain an' Christian,
like you did. Them principles is my principles."</p>

<p>"Principles!" chuckled Amen. "Oh, yes. I
am proud to say, Roy, that your principles are
sound to the core. But I am also bound to say
that if that cavortin' blue-silk-handkerchief, white-breeches 
young monkey owned a stack of principles 
as high as the Tower of Babel, I wouldn't
ride after <i>him</i> to cut a wire across my own sheep-pen."</p>

<p>"I don't like the way Green is actin'," mused
Red, shaking his head gravely. "I'm afeared
he's goin' to be led away by the weak an' beggarly 
elements o' that yander yaller-headed sojourner 
from the States."</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Mr. Parsons," admonished Hilliard. 
"Things will come out all right, I hope."</p>

<p>"Amen," said Bagley.</p>

<br/>

<p>That night Hilliard sat alone in his small smoking 

<!-- page 142 -->

den, vainly trying to fix his attention on the
law book open on the table before him. The night
was unusually still; his ear was painfully alive to
every sound. He started at the hoot of an owl in
the creek bottom, at the dreaming whine of his
dog Bruce on the porch, at the swish of a dew-wet
cabbage-leaf under the leaping passage of a jack-rabbit 
across the garden. When the echo of the
distant double pistol-shots came sharp and clear
on the warm silence, he sprang up and ran to the
porch. It was inconceivable that he should be
there alone, like a man unfriended and forgotten,
while his neighbors, his comrades, the men in
whose company he had labored and frolicked,
camped, hunted, sung, and voted, were following
at the heels of a stranger! The dull trampling of
many horses on the road sounded faint, faint, in
the direction of Blackbird Gully, then loud, louder,
coming on, then faint, fainter again, dying off
into the distance. For one second he had a wild
desire to throw himself upon his horse and follow&mdash;no, 
by the gods! lead; for he could yet lead, if
he so willed&mdash;right or wrong.</p>

<p>The temptation was brief. "Come what will,"
he muttered between his clenched teeth, "I know
I am in the right." And turning resolutely into
the house, he took up his book.</p>

<p>The neighborhood for the next few days rang
with the successful exploit of the fence-cutters.
They had chopped the wire on Burke's prairie to
bits. They had been fired upon by the men guarding 

<!-- page 143 -->

it; they had returned the volley with interest.
They had been pursued; they had plunged aside
into the cover of a thicket, until the armed squad
galloped by, then, becoming pursuers in their turn,
they had chased the terrified wire-pullers back to
their holes. Deerford was a born leader and a
tip-top good fellow! Down with the wire-pullers!</p>

<p>The next Sunday being the Sabbath sacred to
the Baptists of the congregation, Elder Whipple
preached at Peleg Church. There was much talk
concerning the wire-cutting raid, between the sermons. 
Hilliard forced himself to listen quietly to
the boastful descriptions of sundry of the participants. 
Not so Red Parsons.</p>

<p>He quarreled violently with his brother, who
had, according to his gloomy forebodings, been
led away by the weak and beggarly elements of
Deerford. He scolded him soundly for his inattention 
to principles.</p>

<p>"Principles!" shouted Green at length in high
dudgeon. "I thank my Maker I ain't got no
principles, Red Parsons. You 'tend to yourn, ef
you're so proud of 'em." And he turned his back
on his twin. Upon this but too-well-understood
signal of hostility, Mrs. Green and Mrs. Red tearfully 
divided the dinner-baskets, the quilts, and
the children, and withdrew each to her own wagon.
For when the twins quarreled, the making-up was
a question of time.</p>

<p>Deerford was present, but took no part in all
the excited talk. He walked about from group to

<!-- page 144 -->

group, putting in a quiet word here and there,
telling a joke, or relating some personal experience. 
His lightest expression was everywhere
received with profound respect.</p>

<p>Strange to say, the women did not share the
infatuation of their men-folk for the handsome
young stranger.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's personable," admitted Mrs. Crouch,
"an' so I tell Billy. But he's too soft-soddery,
an' there's sompn in his eye fair turns my stomach. 
Roy Hilliard is wo'th a ridgment of him.
That's my jedgment, an' Loreny's, too."</p>

<p>Mrs. Crouch, indeed, voiced the general sentiment 
of the Sisters in Zion, young and old, seated
on the grass around her on the women's side of
the Peleg Church grounds.</p>

<p>When the time came for the afternoon homeward 
ride, Hilliard took the lead, as usual, in the
gay dash after the flying nymphs. But a short
distance from the church, his saddle-girth broke.
Hector, feeling the loose leather whipping his
legs, gathered his feet together and pitched violently. 
When his rider had succeeded in controlling 
him and dismounted, Deerford, far ahead, had
joined Miss Wingate and laid his hand, with the
air of a master, upon her bridle.</p>

<p>Abner Croft, lounging along the roadside,
stepped forward to help with the broken girth,
and Margaret Ransome fell back, reining up her
horse. Hilliard looked up at her with a smile.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hilliard&mdash;Roy," she said abruptly, bending 

<!-- page 145 -->

her dark gray eyes seriously upon him, "I
hear that you did not go out with the fence-cutters, 
Thursday night."</p>

<p>"No," he returned, "I did not."</p>

<p>"Why?" she insisted.</p>

<p>A torrent of words rushed to his lips. He
longed to utter them, to justify himself for seeming 
obstinacy, if not for seeming cowardice. He
longed for the intelligent sympathy which he felt
sure he would receive from this trusted friend;
above all, he longed, through her, to be set right
with Helen. But he restrained himself and answered 
carelessly, as he buckled the saddle-girth,
"Oh, I had important business to attend to at
home that night."</p>

<p>He accompanied her to her gate, but did not
enter, not wishing as yet to trust himself in the
presence of Deerford.</p>

<br/>

<p>Monday, a little past twelve o'clock, Croft
opened the front gate at Mrs. Ransome's and
walked in. "Good-day," he said rather gruffly,
taking in at a glance the group assembled on the
gallery, and piercing at least one present with his
brad-awl eyes.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Croft," said Margaret
pleasantly, but even she could not quite conceal
her amazement at his visit. Abner Croft deliberately 
entering any house except his own&mdash;especially 
any house where there were women-folk!
Such a thing was unheard-of!</p>

<!-- page 146 -->

<p>"Take a chair, Mr. Croft," urged Mrs. Ransome 
hospitably; "Jack, get Mr. Croft a glass of
cool water."</p>

<p>"No, ma'am," said Abner, "I don't want no
drink. An' I'll set on the steps." He seated
himself on the top step, took off his shapeless wool
hat, and remained abnormally silent, his eyes fixed
absently on the vines which wreathed the pillar
opposite. Deerford, who was polishing the hilt
of his little dagger, glanced at him with an amused
smile, and presently began to poke open fun at
him. "The Knight of the Spade," he said airily,
"better known by his additional title, the Baron
of the Crypt, seems to have some unusual weight
on his mind, or can it be his heart? Shall I encourage 
him to unburden?"</p>

<p>Croft turned a stolid face toward him.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," Deerford continued, "he has some
message from his virtuous Highness of the Philanthropic 
Water-works."</p>

<p>Jack laughed, but Margaret flushed indignantly,
and turned to the strange visitor with a gentle inquiry 
about his mother.</p>

<p>Seeing that he had gone too far, Deerford veered
about and talked lightly on, ignoring Abner altogether.</p>

<p>Croft stayed on. The afternoon wore away;
Helen slipped off into her own room; Mrs. Ransome 
had long since bustled out to her preserve-kettles 
in the kitchen-yard. Deerford finally got
up with a yawn. "Come, Jack," he said, "this

<!-- page 147 -->

becomes oppressive. Let us quit the atmosphere
of the mausoleum and seek a less melancholy region. 
Signor of the Mould, I bid you adieu."</p>

<p>Croft paid no more attention to the exaggerated
bow than to the mocking address.</p>

<p>He waited quietly until the gate closed behind
the two young men, then he turned to Margaret.
"Miss Margaret," he began, his face for the first
time losing its impassiveness, "I heard you ast
Mr. Hilliard, yistiddy, why he didn't jine them
raiders Thursday night."</p>

<p>"Yes." Margaret leaned forward, startled.</p>

<p>"Well, 'twa'n't because he was afeard, an'
'twa'n't because he wa'n't wanted ez the leader o'
that gang, an' 'twa'n't because he had any business 
that kep' him at home. He didn't go, Miss
Margaret, because his principles was ag'in it. An'
he warned the others not to go."</p>

<p>He paused a moment, then went on in homely
but vivid language to describe the meeting at
Crouch's, and what had happened there, including
Hilliard's downfall in popularity, and the sudden
rise of Deerford in public favor. "An' whether
he's right or wrong, Miss Margaret," he concluded&mdash;"an' 
<i>I</i> think he's right, an' Mr. Bagley
an' Red Parsons thinks he's right&mdash;but whether
he's right or wrong, he's actin' from principle.
An' <i>ez</i> for that wall-eyed peccary, barkin' aroun'
Crouch's Settle<i>mint</i>, I hate him worse 'n blue
pizen!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Croft. Oh, thank you!"

<!-- page 148 -->

cried Margaret. She reached down and grasped
his hand fervently. How much of the handshake
meant friendship for Hilliard, and how much dislike 
for Deerford, Croft could not afterward divine. 
But that she added the well-digger to the
small circle of her adorers, he had no doubt whatever.</p>

<p>That night, after they had gone to their bed-chamber, 
she sat on a couch silent for some time,
watching Helen comb out her long shining bronze
hair. "Helen," she demanded at length, "do you
know why Abner Croft came here to-day?"</p>

<p>"Why, no," returned Helen smiling. "I confess 
that it <i>looked</i> as if he had come to 'set out'
Mr. Deerford. This is a serious matter, Margaret, 
and your mother ought to"&mdash;</p>

<p>"He came," Margaret continued, ignoring her
friend's playfulness, "to tell me why Mr. Hilliard
did not lead the wire-cutters Thursday night."</p>

<p>"Did he? Oh, why?" Helen clasped her
hands, instantly serious.</p>

<p>Margaret repeated the substance of Abner's
talk. "You must forgive me for saying so, Helen
dear, but I fear that your friend, Mr. Deerford,
will lead Jack&mdash;and others&mdash;into trouble."</p>

<p>"I know he will," said Helen quickly. "I&mdash;I
do not like Allan Deerford, Margaret," she added
in a hushed voice, almost as if afraid. "I have
known him all my life, nearly. And I know, of
course, that he wishes to marry me. But I would
not marry him for"&mdash;she shuddered&mdash;"for

<!-- page 149 -->

worlds. My mother favors his suit; so does his
mother, who idolizes him. The Deerfords are
enormously rich. There is another son, and there
is one daughter. But by the terms of his father's
will, Allan, as the oldest son, will inherit the bulk
of the property. The father, who died many
years ago, it seems, had the English idea about
property. Oh, no, I never could love Allan.
But&mdash;Margaret, this, I know, will seem silly and
childish to you. But I cannot reason it out, or
reason it away. He has a curious influence over
me. I am afraid of him. I feel, when I am in
his presence, as if I were half-paralyzed. I was
terrified when I found he had followed me here.
I have not been myself a moment since he came!"
She burst into hysterical sobs and buried her face
in her hands.</p>

<p>"I understand," said Margaret, "I understand
perfectly, dear. He is like a serpent. He does
not charm me, nor"&mdash;Hilliard, she was about to
say, but checked the name on her lips&mdash;"nor
Mr. Bagley, nor Abner, nor Mrs. Crouch. But
look at his influence over Jack. Jack is changing
from day to day. Oh, Helen!"&mdash;</p>

<p>The two girls fell weeping into each other's
arms, the intangible coolness which had hovered
between them for a week past melting instantly.</p>

<p>Hilliard's name was not mentioned in the long
confidential talk which followed. But he was uppermost 
in the thought of both. When, about
midnight, a reverberating clap of thunder shook

<!-- page 150 -->

the shutters and a dash of rain scurried across the
roof, Helen said na&iuml;vely, "There will be water in
his&mdash;in the water-tank, now."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Margaret.</p>

<p>It was one of those flooding rains which usually
break the drought in that western region, a solid
downpour that lasted, with incredible fury, for
hours, raising Mesquit Creek to a roaring water-course, 
and washing down bridges, pens, and
fences. The creek soon ran down, leaving only
the well-known water-holes here and there. But
Hilliard's water-tank was full to the brim, and the
strengthened underground spring continued to pour
into it a vigorous helping stream.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 151 -->

<div class="center" id="ch10">

<p class="small">LITTLE MARGARET</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> long drought had been broken&mdash;but only
in two. The middle of September saw the country 
as parched as if a drop of rain had never
fallen; the winds blowing over the prairies were
heated as if by a furnace. Only the fat, pale-green 
juicy leaves of the prickly-pear&mdash;which
would seem to draw its nourishment from some
secret and mysterious source; an occasional muddy
water-hole, scorned or forgotten by the grasping
barbed wire; and Hilliard's Pool, as the tank was
now called, afforded any relief for the thirsty
beasts around Crouch's Settlement.</p>

<p>Cattle-paths leading to the tank soon criss-crossed 
like the meshes of a net over the prairie-pasture, 
and through the adjoining woods. Numbers 
of gaunt, wide-horned creatures stood about
the prairie all day, as if loath to get out of sight
and hearing of the placid pool and the steady
crystal stream which fell into it with a rushing
musical sound from Croft's pipe. About sunset
every day the milk-cows of the neighborhood came
leisurely in from their several ranges&mdash;their bells
tinkling, their heavy udders swinging&mdash;to slake

<!-- page 152 -->

their thirst, and to meet, as if by appointment,
the barefooted urchins of either sex whose business
it was to drive them home. The scene, a moment
earlier drowsy and tranquil, became animated.
The mere sight of the cows approaching the tank
seemed to induce a fever of thirst among the stock
already there, and who might be called the habitu&eacute;s
of the place; they plunged instantly in the same
direction. A jostling, hurrying, leaping, slipping
mass of cattle struggled wildly about the edge of
the tank. Croft, who made it a point of honor to
inspect his handiwork at the close of each day,
then had his hands full to preserve life and limb
to the barefoot urchins, who dodged and danced
about, flourishing their driving-sticks, and screaming 
with laughter. The performance afforded him
keen delight. He was inordinately proud of the
pool itself. The spring, he admitted, had turned
out better than he had expected, keeping the water
up to a certain level in spite of the constant drain
upon it.</p>

<p>Hilliard visited the place but rarely. He was
busy in his fields. The sun twisted the brown
cotton-stalks and scorched the green leaves, but
the new cream-white and the day-old pink blossoms 
sent a flush of color over the fields, and the
bolls formed and opened rapidly. The crop, free
as yet of cotton-worms, promised fairly well in
spite of the drought.</p>

<p>A row of tow-heads&mdash;the Red Parsons boys
and the Green Parsons girls&mdash;the family feud in

<!-- page 153 -->

abeyance for the time being&mdash;went up and down
the even rows beside the owner, with their cotton-sacks 
around their necks. Manuel and Juan in
the outer field where the stalks were more stunted
picked, after their own fashion, on their knees,
dragging the open baskets after them.</p>

<p>Hilliard had resumed, though with far less familiarity 
than of old, his visits to Mrs. Ransome's.
Deerford, urged by the infatuated son of the house,
was still a guest there. But the two were seldom
at home. They were riding about the country,
spending much time at Crouch's Well,&mdash;more
than ever a lounging-place for the men of the
neighborhood. Hilliard heard of them at Skipton
and Rassler, with companions and in places which
boded no good for a lad like Jack Ransome. He
had ventured several times when he could find
Jack alone, to remonstrate with him, kindly but
firmly, and he had suffered without resentment
his flippant and angry replies. More than once
he perceived that the boy had been drinking. He
saw the growing anxiety of the mother and sister,
but felt himself powerless to interfere or help.
Deerford's bearing toward himself in their infrequent 
meetings was intangibly insolent; his attitude 
toward Helen was one of arrogant ownership.
Her curious silence in his own presence when
Deerford was near continually outraged and puzzled 
him; her frank return to ease and confidence
when he found her alone, or with Margaret, as
continually renewed his faith. His pride, deeply

<!-- page 154 -->

wounded by the inexplicable coldness of his other
neighbors, withdrew him more and more from all
but necessary contact with them. He applied himself 
with ardor in his leisure moments to a study of
the legal aspect of the question now agitating not
only Crouch's Settlement, but the whole of western 
Texas&mdash;the wire-fence war. He found time
to ride over to the county-seat to confer with lawyers 
and legislators on the subject. And during
the fall sitting of the court there, he presented
himself for examination, and was admitted to the
Bar, with full license to practice the profession of
law.</p>

<p>Meantime, the fence-cutting went merrily on,
under the open leadership of Deerford. The raiders 
even made incursions into the neighboring
counties, leaving a trail of destruction and wrath
behind them.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack," Margaret said imploringly to her
brother, after one of these nocturnal expeditions,
"mother and I are so anxious, so unhappy. Please
give up this life you are leading. At any rate,
give up the wire-cutting. It will end in trouble
for you, I am sure. Dear Jack"&mdash;</p>

<p>"So!" sneered Jack. "Leroy Hilliard has
been preaching to you, has he? Confound him!
I'll blow his brains out, if he comes preaching
around me again."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hilliard has said nothing to me about you
or your affairs," replied his sister indignantly.
"But if you would only listen to him"&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 155 -->

<p>Jack had already turned on his heel, whistling,
and walked off.</p>

<p>He repeated this scrap of conversation at
Crouch's Well, a little later, in the presence of
his "crowd." "I'll let Roy Hilliard know that
he can't bully me, d&mdash;n him," he cried, swelling
with self-importance, and speaking with a thick
tongue.</p>

<p>"Hilliard's too all-fired biggaty, anyhow," remarked 
one of the listeners. "He expects to sail
his Ship of Zion plum into Heaven across that
d&mdash;d free water-tank of his'n. I wisht to God
he'd drop into it and drown hisse'f."</p>

<p>"His ship ought to be scuttled," laughed Deerford. 
"Why don't somebody knock down that
dam and drain his Christian cattle-pool dry?"
He looked around carelessly as he spoke, but there
was a sparkle of deviltry in his eyes.</p>

<br/>

<p>Bud, the oldest Red Parsons boy, dropped his
cotton-sack in Hilliard's field one morning at the
end of the first row. He was about thirteen years
old, freckle-faced and sunburned, with a shrewd
twinkle, got from his mother, in his small eyes,
and a solemn twist of the mouth, like his father's.
"Mr. Roy," he said, "I wisht you'd come over to
the creek a minute. I've got sompn I want to
show you."</p>

<p>"Why, Bud," said his employer, surprised,
"what is it? Can't it wait?"</p>

<p>"It's a snake hung up fer rain," replied Bud.

<!-- page 156 -->

"It's plum curious. I want to ast you about it.
'Twon't take more 'n five minutes."</p>

<p>"All right," said Hilliard good-naturedly. He
dropped his own sack and followed the boy across
the field. The other children, previously warned
and direfully threatened by Bud, kept their heads
down and their hands busy.</p>

<p>Bud ran down the cotton-row, leaped the staked
and ridered fence like a squirrel, crossed over to
the edge of the dry creek, and stopped under a
pecan-tree, awaiting his companion, who made no
pretense of keeping up with him.</p>

<p>A huge chicken-snake, much swollen and glistening 
in the sun's rays, depended from a limb
of the tree, its stiff tail touching the ground.
"Well?" said Hilliard, eying the dead reptile
with some disgust.</p>

<p>Bud set his back against the tree, spread his
legs wide apart, thrust his hands in his breeches-pocket, 
spat on the ground, and looked mysterious.
"Mr. Roy," he said at length, "th' ain't nothin'
curious about that ole chicken-snake. But I got
sompn to tell you, an' I don't want them blabbin'
gals to hear it, nor them fool boys, neither. It
takes a man to keep a secret."</p>

<p>Hilliard forebore to smile and listened gravely.</p>

<p>"It's a message from pa. He couldn't come
hisse'f, because he had to go to Skipton this mornin'. 
But he told me to tell you, Mr. Roy, that
they was goin' to raid our water-tank an' cut the
dam about midnight to-night, so's to let out the
water."</p>

<!-- page 157 -->

<p>"What!" cried Hilliard, startled and incredulous. 
"Who? What for? Who told your father?"</p>

<p>"Hit's thes this-a-way," said Bud, delighted
with his own diplomacy, and with the reception of
his news. "You know pa an' Uncle Green ain't
spoke for nigh six weeks."</p>

<p>Hilliard nodded.</p>

<p>"Seems like pa an' Uncle Green is always fallin' 
out an' not speakin'! Well, this mornin' we-all 
was eatin' breakfast an' we heard somebody
comin' <i>buckety-buckety</i>, down the road. Pa, he
swallered. Ma, she said she'd have to put off the
washin' an' bake some cake, 'cause Uncle Green
was comin' down the road, an' they'd be a fambly
<i>re</i>-union to-morrow. Sure enough, it was Uncle
Green, an' he shook hands with pa, an' he swallered, 
an' he didn't say nothin', an' pa, he swallered, 
an' didn't say nothin'. Then Uncle Green
told pa that some o' them men about Crouch's was
makin' up to cut our dam at our water-tank to-night 
about midnight. He said he was boun'-in-honor 
not to tell who they was, but he thought it
was a durn shame. An' he told pa to tell you
to-onct. Pa he had to go to Skipton, an' Uncle
Green rid back home. An' pa told me to tell
you. An' says he'll be over to set up at the tank
to-night. Ma is bakin' fer a fambly re-union.
An' so I fetched along that ole chicken-snake to
blind them gals an' boys. An' I hung him up
anyhow, seein' as we are a needin' of rain."</p>

<!-- page 158 -->

<p>"Thank you, Bud," said Hilliard, shaking the
dirty paw held out to him. He stood musing a
moment, in deep thought, then turned toward the
field. "Mr. Roy,"&mdash;Bud had lost his important
look; he was twisting his piece of a straw hat in
his hands, and his eyes were lifted in timid appeal. 
"Mr. Roy I kin pop over a squirrel any
time. I kin hanl'e a rifle as good as pa, an' a
sight better. Won't you&mdash;won't you lemme
come an' set up 'long o' you an' pa at our tank
to-night?"</p>

<p>Hilliard started to pat the towhead, but remembered 
the diplomat's dignity in time, and slapped
him heartily on the back instead. "Not to-night,
Bud, not to-night. Tell your father from me that
I am much obliged to him and to Mr. Green Parsons 
for the warning. I will be very glad if he
will ride over about dark to my house and consult
with me."</p>

<p>They went back to the field together, Bud walking 
soberly by his patron's side. He was elated,
in spite of his disappointment in not being allowed
to bear a hand in the proposed defense, and his
work for the rest of the day, as Patty Green Parsons 
reported to his mother the next day at the
<i>re</i>-union, "wa'n't worth shucks."</p>

<p>Hilliard felt strongly inclined to disregard the
friendly warning. He could see no possible reason
why the very men whose cows probably watered
at his pool should wish to destroy it. But he
finally decided, by way of precaution, to keep

<!-- page 159 -->

watch, with Red Parsons,&mdash;at least until after
the hour named for the raid.</p>

<p>At dusk he sat alone on his porch; the sudden
bark of Bruce at the gate announced an arrival.
He walked out, expecting to meet Parsons. Instead, 
he was surprised to find the Reverend David
French.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. French," he exclaimed with genuine 
pleasure, "I am delighted to see you. Get
down and come in. Give me your saddle-bags.
I will have your horse attended to." He hallooed
for Manuel, with his hand on the gate-latch.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Hilliard," replied the preacher,
dismounting, and taking his saddle-bags over his
arm. "I had intended to stop over Sunday with
Mr. and Mrs. Red Parsons. But I came by there
an hour ago, and found the house shut up. No
one seemed to be about. I have therefore taken
the liberty to coming on to throw myself, for the
night at least, upon your hospitality."</p>

<p>"If you knew what a godsend it is to me to
see a friendly face nowadays, Mr. French," said
Hilliard, laughing, "you would not apologize for
coming."</p>

<p>Mr. French noticed the slight bitterness which
tinged the laugh and wondered at it, as he followed 
his host into the house.</p>

<p>The two men had met several times since the
occasion of Red Parsons's baptism, but these meetings 
had been no more than a passing handshake
and a polite greeting. They were now mutually

<!-- page 160 -->

surprised, sitting opposite each other at the well-appointed 
supper-table; the Reverend David at
the culture and refinement of the young backwoodsman, 
and Roy at the wide range of the preacher's
knowledge and his keen and liberal interest in
every-day affairs.</p>

<p>It was with regret that Hilliard rose about nine
o'clock to prepare for his solitary vigil at the pool.
He accounted for the non-appearance of Red Parsons 
by the reconciliation of the twins, which had
probably driven the appointment out of his head,
or he might, he thought, have been detained at
Skipton, or perhaps Bud had failed to deliver his
own message.</p>

<p>"Will you make yourself comfortable for the
night, Mr. French," he said, taking his gun from
its rack over the door and fastening on his cartridge-belt. 
"I am compelled to leave you for
some hours at least. You will find a small collection 
of books on the shelf yonder. Here are pipes
and tobacco. And your bed"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" demanded French,
with a ring of authority in his voice.</p>

<p>Hilliard did not resent the tone. Its frankness
pleased him. "I will tell you," he said with
equal frankness. And leaning on his gun, he related 
as much of the neighborhood history for the
past three months as was necessary to explain his
own present situation. "I have somehow managed
to become personally very unpopular," he concluded, 
smiling a little sadly. "I give you my

<!-- page 161 -->

word I have not the least idea why. My only
offense, so far as I know, has been my opposition
to the promiscuous fence-cutting. This hardly
seems to be sufficient ground for the persistent
avoidance of me by my sometime friends and neighbors, 
which I confess has disturbed me no little.
Certainly it is not sufficient ground for a malevolence 
which would seek to destroy my property.
This, however, as I have already told you, I do
not believe. I ought to have warned you before
you came in," he added, "that you were running
the risk of impairing your own influence by associating 
with me."</p>

<p>The minister laughed. "But," he exclaimed
seriously, "I agree with you that these men cannot
possibly intend to cut the dam. There could be
no gain to any one in its loss. On the contrary"&mdash;</p>

<p>"No," returned Hilliard. "I believe it to be
merely an idle threat, made, perhaps, in jest.
But since a great deal depends on keeping that
dam intact, I will not run any risk. Manuel will
look after you"&mdash;</p>

<p>But Mr. French had already arisen, and was
looking about for his hat. "Oh, I am going with
you, if you will allow me, or rather, whether you
will allow me or not," he said. "I suppose my
cloth forbids me the use of a gun on such an occasion, 
but I should be justified, in a case like this,
if it came to blows, in the use of my fists."</p>

<p>Hilliard, though pleased with his guest's interest, 
could not but be secretly amused at this

<!-- page 162 -->

speech. He cast a swift glance at the coat sleeve
hanging loosely upon the thin arm, and at the
small hand grasping a cambric pocket handkerchief. 
But he accepted the companionship gratefully.</p>

<p>They walked over to the pool, about three quarters 
of a mile from the house. The wood was very
dark, the stubby post-oaks shutting out the clear
sky, with its gleaming stars. The small prairie
was light by comparison. There was no sound
there except the measured breathing of the cattle
lying about&mdash;formless heaps that hardly stirred
as the two men passed&mdash;and the fall of the spring
water into the tank. They seated themselves on
the dry grass at the upper edge of the pool, lighted
pipes, and took up the interrupted thread of conversation. 
Leaving Crouch's Settlement and its
petty round of life far aside, they rode full tilt, as
it were, into a broader arena,&mdash;books, music,
statecraft, epoch-makers; Hilliard felt, breathing
in this whiff of a delight long untasted, like comparing 
himself to the famished cattle that fought
for a life-giving draught from his own pool!</p>

<p>The flow of talk was interrupted by a distant
but unmistakable sound,&mdash;the beat of horse's feet.
He sprang up, grasped his gun, and leaned forward, 
listening. It was plainly a single rider
coming at a gallop down the Branch road, which
ran some four or five hundred yards to the left of
Hilliard's prairie. The sound drew near and
passed on. The horseman, whoever he was, had

<!-- page 163 -->

turned aside some distance below and was apparently 
riding up to Hilliard's own gate. The barking 
of dogs, and above it the echo of a voice came
clearly, borne on the night wind. There was a
pause and then the rider returned more rapidly
along the road and presently branched off across
the prairie itself.</p>

<p>"Halt!" cried Hilliard, throwing his gun to his
shoulder. "Who is there? Halt, or I fire."</p>

<p>The horse stopped abruptly, thrown on his
haunches by the sudden tightening of the rein.
"Don't shoot. It is I, Mr. Hilliard." The rider
was a woman. Hilliard recognized the clear liquid
voice of Margaret Ransome.</p>

<p>"Great God," he cried, dropping his gun and
running forward. "What is it? What has happened? 
Helen?"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Helen is well. Nothing has happened&mdash;to
any of us," Margaret called out. She waited for
him to come up, then leaned down toward him, her
face white and ghost-like in the starlight. "But,
Red Parsons's baby, his only girl, little Margaret,
is lost. Jack and Mr. Deerford are away. I fear
there is another raid, for nearly all the men seem
to be absent from their homes. Mother has gone
over to stay with Mrs. Parsons, who is beside herself 
with grief and anxiety. Is that you, Jack?"
she called sharply, catching sight of the indistinct
figure standing by the pool. "Oh, I am so glad!
Jack, dear, I need you so. Come! Come!"</p>

<p>Hilliard's heart throbbed with pity. He explained 

<!-- page 164 -->

hurriedly, and invited French to join them.
"They missed her about three o'clock," Margaret
resumed, after greeting the minister and smothering 
a disappointed sigh. "And they have been
searching for her ever since. Her father reached
home about sundown from Skipton. He and Mr.
Bagley are in Shinn-Oak Prairie now; Mr. Green
Parsons and Mr. Croft are searching the creek
bottom back of Waldrup's field. They will all
meet at Blackbird Gully at ten o'clock, unless
they find the child before then. She is my own
namesake, Mr. French." She covered her face
with her hands and wept silently. "She is only
three years old," she said when she could speak
again. "Such a little mite of a creature. Oh,
Roy!"</p>

<p>He touched his lips to her hand, which he had
taken in his own. "Do not despond, Margaret,"
he said confidently. "We will find her. It is
nearly ten o'clock now," he added, striking a
match and consulting his watch. "Have they
lanterns, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she replied, heartened by his cheery
tone. "I came for you as soon as I had taken
mother over to Mrs. Parsons. Mr. Bagley had
left the message for you there. He knew that you
would come. But there was no one to send after
you, so I came."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Margaret. I will&mdash;you are not
afraid to ride home alone? Well, then, I will get
over to Blackbird Gully at once. Good-night,
Margaret. God bless you, Margaret."</p>

<!-- page 165 -->

<p>He had walked a few paces beside her stirrup
as she rode off. He listened a second or so to the
steady gallop of her horse in the homeward road.
Then he returned to the tank. "I will conduct
you as far as the field, Mr. French," he said, picking 
up his gun. "From there you can easily find
your way to the house"&mdash;</p>

<p>"What!" interrupted French, with a frown, so
to speak, in his voice. "Do you think I am going
back to the house, while Red Parsons's baby&mdash;anybody's 
baby&mdash;is lost in the woods? I am
astonished at you, sir!"</p>

<p>The words were gravely spoken and quite evidently 
intended as a rebuke. "I christened little
Margaret the last time I was here," he pursued,
more gently. "She was the first wee lamb of my
small flock here."</p>

<p>Hilliard murmured an apology, and set off without 
further ceremony, with the little man at his
elbow. They had but to follow the open road for
about two miles in order to reach the rendezvous.</p>

<p>Hilliard at first walked slowly, fearful of wearying 
his companion. But in a few moments he saw
by the steady swing of the Reverend David's gait
that he could walk as well as preach, and he made
no ado about quickening his own pace. They
made the short journey in silence, each occupied
by his own thoughts. As they approached the
heavy line, densely black in the dim starlight,
which indicated the dip of the road into Blackbird
Gully, they saw the gleam of lanterns, like a small

<!-- page 166 -->

procession of fireflies, winding in and out among
the trees on the right. Hilliard gave a quick
halloo which echoed lonesomely through the silence,
and they were soon in the midst of the searching-party. 
This consisted of the Parsons twins, Amos
Bagley, Abner Croft, Bud Parsons, and Patty
Green Parsons. The last named, a sturdy, stumpy,
red-haired damsel of thirteen, had so stoutly maintained 
her right to join the party,&mdash;in the face of
stern opposition, Bud even threatening to "rock"
her back to the house,&mdash;that consent had perforce
been given.</p>

<p>Red Parsons grasped Hilliard's hand, and the
minister's in turn. He was unable to speak; the
tears were rolling down his cheeks; he looked
worn and haggard. Mr. French drew him apart.</p>

<p>The others had a hasty conference. So far, not
a trace or a token of the lost child had been found;
there was therefore no clue as to the direction
which her wanderings might have taken. When
last seen, she was quietly playing with her dolls
and dishes under a china-tree in a corner of the
yard. The fields and woods immediately around
the house had been carefully searched; the well,
and a water-hole near, had been dragged. Hilliard, 
taking the lead, now proposed to divide the
small party into three detachments and scour the
country, nook and cranny, until the child was
found. In case of failure, they were all to meet
at the Gully at daybreak for fresh consultation.
It was agreed that a single pistol-shot would announce 

<!-- page 167 -->

the finding of the child. An additional
shot would mean that she was alive. In that case,
Croft and Patty were deputed to carry the news at
once to the stricken mother. But if&mdash;</p>

<p>"No! No! No!" cried the father, breaking
down utterly for the first time. "Don't ye say
it, Roy. Don't ye dassent to say it. My little
gal! My baby-gal!"</p>

<p>For a moment no one had the heart or the voice
to speak. "Come 'long o' me, Red," Croft said
gently, taking him by the arm, "an' don't ye
werry. Wher' ever that baby-gal is, the Lord's
arms is around her."</p>

<p>"Amen," said Bagley reverently, watching them
trudge off into the darkness, with Patty trotting
valiantly at their heels. Before he himself started
in company with Green Parsons, he took Hilliard
aside. "What in the name o' thunder did you
fetch the little parson along for?" he whispered.
"He's a powerful hand at dippin'. But dippin'
is one thing an' mesquit woods at midnight is
another. He'll git lost, sure as shootin', an'
you'll have a couple of infants to look for 'stead
of one."</p>

<p>This was Hilliard's own opinion, though he was
beginning to respect the parson's pluck. All he
said, however, was, "He would come. I will try
and keep him in sight."</p>

<p>Bagley, with Green Parsons and Bud, took up
the march toward the beat assigned them. Hilliard 
had chosen for his own scrutiny a long

<!-- page 168 -->

stretch of Mesquit Creek bottom,&mdash;a desolate
crater-like glade which opened out, a couple of
miles below where he entered it with French, into
a piece of ground known as the Island. This was
a high ridge several acres in extent completely
surrounded by a deep moat-like, natural gulch,
with precipitous rain-furrowed sides.</p>

<p>The glade, studded with enormous trees and
hung with a matted tangle of grape and bamboo
vines, was almost impenetrable. After a freshet,
it was a swirling and dangerous pool; the ground,
now dry, was honeycombed with treacherous fissures, 
which were hidden by a thick undergrowth
of bushes and weeds. The midnight darkness of
this unfrequented place was terrifying. Hilliard
felt the hair rise on his head at the slippery gliding 
of a snake under his feet, or the furry weight
of a spider against his cheek. More than once he
saw the gleam of fiery eyes, or heard an ominous
rattle at his elbow. He swung the lantern low,
throwing its pale light upon every inch of ground.
A second unlighted lantern hung over his arm,
designed to be left as a beacon at a certain turn
of the bottom.</p>

<p>"I will take the other lantern, Mr. Hilliard,"
the minister said, after an hour of this minute
examination, "and bear off to the left. We can
in that way cover more ground."</p>

<p>Hilliard stood up, dismayed by this request.
"I&mdash;I fear you are not sufficiently acquainted
with these parts, Mr. French," he stammered;
"you might"&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 169 -->

<p>"Get lost," he was about to add, but in truth
he did not dare!</p>

<p>"Give me the lantern." The Reverend David's
tone was severe. "If I find myself at a loss, I
will halloo."</p>

<p>Hilliard meekly lighted the lantern and handed
it to him. "I have come to the conclusion," he
muttered, looking after the twinkling light as it
bore off slowly to the left and disappeared in the
underbrush, "that the little parson, whatever he
may lack, has got a will of his own."</p>

<p>His own search was fruitless; as much as he
dreaded to find any trace of the child in this wild-cat 
haunted cove, he was beginning to grow sick
with apprehension. He kept his ear strained for
the hoped-for signal from the others. But none
came, and the night was wearing away.</p>

<p>At the end of another dreary hour, he came
suddenly in sight of French's lantern, and peering 
intently forward, he made out the figure of
its bearer.</p>

<p>"You need not cross that gulch, Mr. French,"
he shouted at once. "A cat could hardly get over
to that island, much less a baby&mdash;or a preacher,"
he added impatiently, under his breath.</p>

<p>French shouted back an ambiguous reply which,
had he been a layman, could doubtless have been
interpreted to mean: "Mind your own business."
Here was no question of bringing the church into
ridicule or disfavor; no vexing decision regarding
gown and bands bred irresolution or timidity!

<!-- page 170 -->

Settling his spectacles firmly on his nose, and
hooking the lantern over his left arm, he was
already letting himself down the concave side of
the dry ditch, by the aid of a tangle of may-pop
and morning-glory vines. The ascent on the other
side was more sloping and far less difficult.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Hilliard heard a sharp halloo. 
He ran up out of the bottom in the direction
of the island, as fast as he could. French, on
the farther side of the gulch, was swinging his
lantern frantically in one hand. In the other he
held out something which made Hilliard's knees
tremble under him. It was a little blue sunbonnet.</p>

<p>The two men gazed at each other across the
width of the gulch, trembling, and absolutely
incapable of speech; the lanterns shook in their
nerveless hands.</p>

<p>Then Hilliard scrambled down and over,&mdash;he
never knew how. "I found it," said the parson
in a whisper, "just here where I stand. I thought
I saw in the trailing vines, broken here and there,
evidences that something had fallen over into the
gully. The fall was doubtless softened by the
mass of vines. But&mdash;but it does not seem possible, 
does it, that she could have climbed up on
this side?"</p>

<p>"No," Hilliard whispered back. They were
both too awestruck to speak aloud. "Some animal, 
a wild-cat, or a cougar, must have brought
the bonnet here in his mouth and dropped it."

<!-- page 171 -->

He shuddered, not daring to examine the little
bonnet too closely, lest he should find it sprinkled
with blood.</p>

<p>The ridge, or knoll, was almost naked within
its encircling, green-draped, empty moat. A few
clumps of shinn-oak, covered with feather-vines
in full bloom, grew here and there, dotting the
barren ground with dark, white-starred masses.
Hilliard walked to these, one after another, with
his companion silent at his elbow, throwing the
light carefully in every direction. He felt surer
and surer in his own mind that the child had been
torn to pieces in the bottom. He felt a sickening
dread at the thought of beginning the search there
again. Even as this terror shook him, he stooped
by a little motte of shinn-oak to pull aside a curtain 
of feather-vine. Well, there she lay, her
round baby-cheeks scratched and torn by the
briars, her yellow hair matted with sticks and
leaves, her clothes in tatters, but alive! And as
rosy, and as sound asleep as if lapped in her
cradle at home, or rocked on her mother's breast.
A long trail of the feather-vine lying across her
forehead, crowned her with its white silken blossoms.</p>

<p>Hilliard stooped with a sob and lifted her in
his arms. He stumbled blindly across the island,
French carrying the lanterns. They struck by
chance the exact spot where the little one had
toiled up the slope, holding on by the vines, and
leaving fragments of her dress fluttering from the
briars.</p>

<!-- page 172 -->

<p>It was only when, with great difficulty, they
had succeeded in getting their treasure-trove and
themselves across the gulch&mdash;little Margaret
sleeping profoundly during the transit&mdash;that Hilliard 
remembered anything, or anybody else.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, Mr. French," he panted,
"get the pistol out of my hip-pocket and fire it
off. Twice. Can you do it?"</p>

<p>"I reckon so," returned the Reverend David
with a click in his throat almost as sharp as the
click of the trigger. Two shots broke the stillness
in rapid succession.</p>

<p>"Do you think, Roy," asked French, with his
finger on the hammer, "do you think it would be
amiss to fire off the other barrels?"</p>

<p>"God bless you, David, no!" shouted Hilliard,
beside himself with excitement.</p>

<p>David emptied the other four barrels. Far-off
answering shots were heard in different directions.
They moved on as rapidly as possible, leaving the
bottom to the left and heading toward the Parsonses' 
home. In less than a quarter of an hour
a volley of shots seemed to indicate that the other
members of the searching-party were now all together. 
These were answered by French from
the reloaded pistol. In less than a quarter of
an hour the dancing glimmer of lanterns advancing
through the trees was descried. Hilliard paused.
"Take her to him," he said huskily, placing the
child in the preacher's arms. "I can't."</p>

<p>And he hung back, overcome and half ashamed

<!-- page 173 -->

of his own emotion, until he saw Red Parsons
stoop with a mighty groan that shook his tall form
from head to foot, and take his baby-girl from
David's arms.</p>

<p>Not a word had been uttered. Bud attempted a
cheer, but it died feebly in his throat.</p>

<p>"Let us pray," said Mr. French, with quiet
dignity. He dropped upon his knees.</p>

<p>It was a strangely solemn scene, and one not
soon to be forgotten by those present,&mdash;the dark
woods stretching away sombre and silent, the dark
sky, darker for the faint streak of dawn under
the eastern horizon, the smoky lanterns dimly illuminating 
the kneeling figures, and touching with
almost unearthly brightness the flowing hair of
the child asleep on her father's breast, the fervent
upturned face of the servant of God, the clear
voice rising on the wandering night wind!</p>

<p>"Parson," said Green Parsons, when they arose
from their knees, "I'm a Methodist born, an' a
Methodist I'll die. But <i>ef</i> I wa'n't a Methodist,
I'd jine <i>you</i>, an' what's mo', by jing! I'd be
dipped!"</p>

<p>"Lord, Red," he added solemnly a little later,
as they tramped together homeward, "supposen
me an' you hadn't of made up! Supposen the
Devil had kep' me away from you endurin' of
this fiery trial!"</p>

<p>Red pressed his lips to little Margaret's forehead. 
"By the Lord's he'p, Green," he said,
looking at his twin with wet eyes, "we ain't never
goin' to qua'l ag'in."</p>

<!-- page 174 -->

<p>"Amen," said Bagley, just behind them.</p>

<p>Croft, with Bud and Patty, had sped on ahead
with the good news. When the remainder of the
party reached the house, which was all alight
and all astir with rejoicing, Hilliard and Bagley
turned aside into the stable under pretense of
saddling some horses, in order not to be present
at the meeting between husband and wife.</p>

<p>When Abner and David, with Green Parsons,
came out, their faces shone as if they had been
standing in the glory of the Divine Presence.
The party mounted, and began the homeward ride
in silence. Only when they halted at the cross-road 
where they were to separate and go their
several ways, Green Parsons opened his lips to
say soberly: "Boys&mdash;beggin' of your pardon,
Parson French! I have helt in as long as I can.
Ef I don't holler, I'll bust wide open!" With
this he gave vent to a succession of wild whoops
which fairly shook the post-oak rough and aroused
every bird and beast within reach. The others,
even David himself, joined heartily in the unique
expression of thanksgiving.</p>

<p>"Do you not think, Mr. Hilliard," said Mr.
French as they rode on together, "would it not
be well for us to ride by Mrs. Ransome's house
and let Miss Ransome know that her namesake
has been found, and is alive and well?" He had
lost his tone of authority, and spoke with stammering 
timidity.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Hilliard, surprised at himself
for not having thought of this.</p>

<!-- page 175 -->

<p>She came flying down to the gate at the sound
of their approach. "Oh, thank God! Thank
God! And God bless you both!" she cried, with
a rush of happy tears, when she had heard the
story told by Hilliard. He was watching the
lighted window while he spoke, and the figure
behind the curtain which he surmised was Helen's.</p>

<p>"Thank Mr. French, Margaret," he replied.
"If it had not been for him, she would not have
been found. Or she would have been found too
late."</p>

<p>"Do not believe him, Miss Ransome," said the
preacher nervously, already turning his horse's
head. "I was but his lieutenant."</p>

<p>They rode on. They were both beginning to
feel, at last, the strain of the night's fatigue and
apprehension; the chill dawn made them shiver.
For the day was breaking, the stars had quite
paled, and there was a yellow glimmer in the east.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hilliard," demanded the clergyman
abruptly, as they turned into Hilliard's prairie,
"can you tell me whether Miss Ransome's affections 
are engaged?"</p>

<p>The shock of the question made Hilliard almost
reel in his saddle. The manly directness and the
homely simplicity of it stirred him, but a queer
dog-in-the-manger feeling at the same time shook
him, and shook him hard. But he replied at
once, with unaffected warmth, "She is heart-free.
Of that I am absolutely certain. Margaret Ransome 
is beyond my poor praise, Mr. French; but

<!-- page 176 -->

I can at least say that the man who wins her will
be fortunate among men. She is as dear to me
as if she were my own sister. And I wish you
success with all my heart, David."</p>

<p>French grasped the proffered hand and shook
it eagerly. What he might have said in reply,
however, was checked by a horrified exclamation
from his companion.</p>

<p>The latter had reined in his horse, and was
looking down with dilated eyes upon the wreck
of his pool. The dam had been destroyed, the
loosened stones and earth were piled upon each
side of the wide opening through which the water
had escaped, leaving the tank empty, except for
a muddy little pond in the bottom. The covered
ditch leading from the underground spring had
been laid open, and the pipe torn up; the twisted
and disjointed fragments were found afterward in
the creek bed.</p>

<p>The cattle had already discovered their loss,
and were huddled dejectedly over against the trampled 
edge of the basin. As if in mockery, and
as a last taunt, a strand of barbed wire had been
stretched across the cleft in the dam, with a pair
of nippers swinging to it.</p>

<p>Hilliard's square jaws worked convulsively; his
birth-mark, which French had never noticed before, 
blazed out; then it faded slowly. Mastering
himself with a quick inward struggle, he gathered
up his bridle-reins. "The baby, or the dam, eh,
David?" he said; and his smile made David's
heart leap.</p>

<p>XI</p>

<p class="small">MEASURING THE ROAD</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day in December, young Joe Wyatt stopped
at Hilliard's gate. He wore an embarrassed air,
and avoided looking at the master of the house,
who came out, hailing him with the genial Mesquit
Creek salutation: "Hello, young Joe. 'Light,
and come in."</p>

<p>"No," said young Joe, threshing the toe of his
boot with his quirt. "I ain't got time; I jest
stopped by to pass the time o' day, an' to fetch
you a message from Gran'pap."</p>

<p>The destruction of Hilliard's Pool was now an
old story. Its direct result had been the death
of numbers of the cattle which had watered there,
among them several of his own.</p>

<p>"Shall you rebuild the dam?" Mr. French had
asked him that October morning, as they turned
their horses' heads homeward, after surveying the
ruin.</p>

<p>"No," he had made answer. "I cannot rebuild
it. My hands are full. It will be all I can do
to get my cotton picked, and ginned, and ready for
market. Besides," he added wearily, "it would
be no use. Whoever destroyed it this time would

<!-- page 178 -->

destroy it again." He had sedulously refrained
from any inquiry into the matter. "I cannot
afford to know who did it," he said to Margaret
Ransome, and it did not escape him that she drew
a long breath as of relief. There was a shamefacedness 
about certain men when he met them,
which disturbed him, the recollection of which he
dismissed from his mind as speedily as possible.
Young Joe's uneasiness now sent a flush over Hilliard's 
cheek. But he laid a friendly hand on the
horse's neck and said gayly: "Does the old man
want to beat me shooting jack-rabbits?" The
elder Wyatt's conviction that he could "outshoot
creation" was one of his amiable weaknesses, and
many such a challenge had Hilliard received and
accepted in times past.</p>

<p>"Worse 'n that," snickered young Joe, his discomfort 
vanishing before his host's frank smile.
"He wants you to he'p him measure the Peleg
road."</p>

<p>"Whew!" Hilliard thrust his hands in his
pockets and puckered his lips into a shrill whistle.
"All right," he laughed. "When?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow. Th' ole man'll stop by for you
about sun-up."</p>

<p>After a little more talk, young Joe galloped off,
and Hilliard went out to his cotton-pens, where
Manuel and Juan were loading a wagon for the
gin. The flocky snow-white crop was all in. A
few belated bolls only dotted the dry fields; the
sheltered pens were filled to bursting.</p>

<!-- page 179 -->

<p>Down by the creek, the Red Parsons boys and
the Green Parsons girls, all under the self-constituted 
supervision of Bud, were thrashing down
and gathering the pecans,&mdash;easily the largest and
the finest on the creek. Their boisterous shouts
and shrill laughter rang on the gusty norther
which was blowing up, big end foremost.</p>

<p>Hilliard had a comfortable sense of freedom,
after his year's hard labor, which went far toward
counterbalancing his loss of popularity,&mdash;so galling 
to him in the beginning. He had, so it seemed
to himself, recovered his equilibrium at the moment 
of his severest trial,&mdash;the wanton cutting
of his dam. In truth, however, he had been settling,
as it were, for some time before that event;
the waters of his soul, shaken and muddied by
the painful change in his outer condition, had
been gradually clearing, and the ugly sediment
of egotism and arrogance had gone to the bottom.
He did not realize it himself, but he had been
bettered and strengthened by the isolation in which
he had been compelled to live. His exuberant
nature had been a little sobered, but his grasp on
himself, and consequently on others, would henceforth 
be firmer. A certain charming joyousness
of manner had given place to a sedate self-restraint, 
destined to be equally winning in the days
to come.</p>

<p>It must not go unrecorded that those friends
who had remained stanch throughout his dark
hours had had no small share in sustaining and
strengthening his oftentimes troubled soul.</p>

<!-- page 180 -->

<p>Nothing of all this shaped itself in his brain,
as he lent a hand with the loading. But he did
feel once more that life was good. The cotton,
ginned and baled at the Skipton Gin, and the
pecans gathered and barreled, he proposed to haul
both to W&mdash;&mdash; himself. Only this year there
would be a train of wagons instead of two.</p>

<p>"You shall dance in the wagon-yard at W&mdash;&mdash;
next week, Manuel," he said, looking up at the
old Mexican from the trace-chain he was fastening. 
Manuel's leathery face remained impassive,
but there was a twinkle in his eyes. "Si, se&ntilde;or,
si, si!" he said, curling the long lash of his whip
over the back of his mules.</p>

<p>The wagon rolled out through the lot gate.
Hilliard's first load of cotton was off to the gin.</p>

<p>The next morning, the dull rumble of Mr.
Wyatt's heavy wagon-wheels heralded his approach 
long before sunrise. Hilliard, buttoned to
the ears in his overcoat, went out to meet him,
laughing a little to himself, and wondering what
was in the wind.</p>

<p>For Uncle Joe's road-measuring was not a mere
question of rods and miles, not a cut and dried
counting up and setting down of the quips and
quiddities of a neighborhood highway. It was an
important and solemn function in itself, its result
being each time a shifting of sign-posts and a
general befogging of the public mind as to (official) 
distances. But the real significance of the
ceremony&mdash;which took place at irregular intervals,

<!-- page 181 -->

sometimes as seldom as once a year, usually about
once in a quarter&mdash;was that it indicated some
profound agitation in Mr. Wyatt's own mind,
as, for example, whether Johnny Giles, being a
Republican, was entitled to vote for Justice of
the Peace in Crouch's Precinct? How was Daniel
let down into the den of lions? Is there any
better rifle, lock stock and barrel, than the Winchester? 
etc., etc.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Wyatt's custom, whenever such
vital questions disturbed his inner being, to summon 
one, or at the most two, of his fellow-citizens
to assist him in measuring the Peleg road&mdash;from
Peleg Church to the Skipton Junction. During
the progress of this rite, the problem, whatever it
was, was satisfactorily settled.</p>

<p>Uncle Joe, who on this occasion was alone,
reined up his horses at sight of Hilliard, and held
out his hand with a heartiness which had in it no
such undercurrent of uneasiness as had accompanied 
young Joe's conscience-shamed greeting the
day before. "Hop in, Roy," he said wheezily,
"we'll medjure from here to the cross-road first,
an' take t' other end as we come back. Tie her
on."</p>

<p>He reached under the seat, and produced a
white cotton rag, which his companion proceeded
to tie, gravely, on a spoke of the left hind wheel.
Then he seated himself beside the driver, but with
his back to the horses, note-book and pencil in
hand; Uncle Joe touched up his team, the ponderous 

<!-- page 182 -->

wagon lurched forward, and the operation
began.</p>

<p>The primitive method of measuring a road in
vogue on Mesquit Creek consisted in first spanning 
the outer circumferences of a wagon wheel;
afterward, by means of a white rag fastened to
one of the spokes, its revolutions were noted and
counted; these aggregated turns of the slowly
revolving wheel giving, accordingly as the teller
was more or less attentive, a more or less accurate
admeasurement of the distance traveled over.</p>

<p>In the heat of the discussions which occupied
Uncle Joe and his assistants, the miles on Peleg
road varied in length from season to season.
The women said it was aggravating never to be
able to lay your hands on a milestone when you
wanted it! To the men, these perennial shufflings,
progressive and retrogressive, of the sign-posts
were so many pleasant reminders of past controversies.</p>

<p>Hilliard had counted and set down several hundred 
turns of the white rag. He began to wonder
why he had been asked. Mr. Wyatt, muffled in
his blanket overcoat and knitted comforter, had
not opened his lips except to remonstrate with his
off horse, a fine colt hardly broken to harness.
The norther had spent its force during the night,
but had left the air tingling with a suggestion
of sleet or snow. The low-hung gray sky was
dotted from time to time by arrow-shaped strings
of wild geese speeding southward, and honking

<!-- page 183 -->

ominously. A forlorn jack-rabbit crossed the
road with a flying leap, and hustled away, scattering 
the dry leaves under the bare post-oaks; Mr.
Wyatt made a cross with his toe in the bottom of
the wagon, and spat in it. "Five hundred and
forty-one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five," counted
Hilliard monotonously.</p>

<p>"Roy!" The voice broke the silence so unexpectedly 
that he started and skipped a couple of
hundred. "Seven hundred and forty-six, forty-seven, 
forty-eight. Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>"This here settle<i>ment</i> has got itse'f into a
durned mess, endurin' of the last six mont's."</p>

<p>"&mdash;Forty-nine. Seven hundred and fifty-one&mdash;two. 
Has it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it has. An' what's mo', it's goin' plum
to the devil, lessn somebody has got main strenk
enough to hold it back."</p>

<p>Hilliard's blood stirred a little, but he counted
calmly on. "Fifty-seven&mdash;eight&mdash;nine."</p>

<p>"The boys, leas' ways some of 'em, is gittin'
tired o' follerin a'ter Deerford. I don't take no
stock in him myse'f, <i>although</i>, I'm boun' to say,
I was took by his sort o' dashin' way for a while.
I&mdash;I ain't goin' to tech on the subjec' of yo'
water-tank, Roy"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Eight hundred and ninety-nine," jerked Hilliard. 
"No, Mr. Wyatt, we will not speak of
that, if you please."</p>

<p>"Well, there's them that I know of, that's
mighty sorry they ever lent a hand in that business, 

<!-- page 184 -->

that's all! Now, the boys wants you to
come forrard ag'in an' take a-holt. They've been
quarrelin' with Deerford, an' they've been quarrelin' 
'mongs' themselves. An' they've settled
on you to straighten 'em all out. Fer God's sake,
take a-holt, Roy. You kin lead the settlement
onct mo', an' if you want to, by jing, I believe
you kin lead the whole county!"</p>

<p>"Stop the team a minute, Uncle Joe." Hilliard 
jumped down and picked up a baby squirrel
which was lying in the rutty road. One of its
forefeet hung limp and helpless; it looked at him
with suffering eyes, and cowered trembling in
his palm. He thrust it into his breast pocket.
"Well?" he said, leaning against the wheel. He
could not deny that the draught held to his lips
was tempting. A swift vision of himself surrounded 
as in times past with a ring of admiring
faces shot into his mind. "Well?" he repeated,
smiling up into the kindly old face looking down
at him.</p>

<p>"Well," echoed Mr. Wyatt anxiously.
"There's the leadership of Crouch's Settle<i>ment</i>
an' the county. All you've got to do is to pick
it up. The boys has got a big raid laid off for
Monday night. Clean acrost the county, onto
Colbrook's Ranch. They're startin' at nine
o'clock Monday night from Blackbird Gully.
You meet 'em there"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Wyatt," interrupted the young man, "if
I met the boys at Blackbird Gully, it would be

<!-- page 185 -->

to do my best to keep them from any more unlawful 
fence-cutting."</p>

<p>"Then stay away!" returned Mr. Wyatt
quickly. "God Almighty couldn't keep 'em from
wire-cuttin' now! It's what they live on mostly.
That's what they're after you for. Ef you want
to lead 'em, you've got to lead 'em where they
want to go." His voice had risen to a querulous
shriek.</p>

<p>Hilliard put his foot on the hub of the wheel
and sprang back into the wagon. "Drive on,
Mr. Wyatt," he said composedly. "Let us get
through with the measuring. I don't want the
leadership of Crouch's Settlement at any such
price."</p>

<p>Mr. Wyatt broke down suddenly. "I knowed
you wouldn't," he said in a dejected tone. "I
said I'd ack as a trustee betwix' you an' them fool
boys. But I knowed you wouldn't go back on
yo' convincements an' yo' principles which is ag'inst
onlawful performances."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Uncle Joe," said Hilliard heartily.</p>

<p>"You'll be mo' onpopular than ever, I'm
afeard, Roy." The old man sighed as he picked
up the reins. "D&mdash;n Deerford, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Never mind, Uncle Joe. I have a few friends
left in the Settlement, eh? We will say no more
about it. Where did we leave off? Oh. Twelve
hundred and sixty-one&mdash;two&mdash;three."</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n Deerford, anyhow," repeated Mr. Wyatt, 

<!-- page 186 -->

with increased gusto. "Are you goin' to the
candy-pullin' at Mis' Crouch's Sat'day night?"
he presently asked.</p>

<p>"Yes." Hilliard's thoughts, busy&mdash;and sombre&mdash;a 
moment before over his own semi-isolation, 
and the troubles which he believed were in
store for the neighborhood, took another and a
pleasanter tack. He had been looking forward
for a week to this Christmas Eve frolic, where he
knew he should meet Helen Wingate. His opportunities 
for seeing her were becoming more and
more rare. He had again and abruptly ceased his
visits to Mrs. Ransome's house. Jack had pointedly 
turned a cold shoulder upon him in full view
of all his small world at Peleg Church, with Deerford 
standing by. It was a petty insult, and one
that he could not in justice to his own manhood
openly resent. But he could not present himself
again in the house where the lad was master.</p>

<p>Margaret's eyes were troubled, and Helen's
downcast, when he looked over at them, sitting on
the women's benches in the church, from his own
place among the men. The two girls no longer
joined in the time-honored Sunday afternoon homeward 
race, but waited and rode quietly away, accompanied 
by Jack and Deerford. Deerford, hovering 
incessantly like a beautiful evil spirit about
the neighborhood, seemed determined to cut his
rival off from all communication with his kind.
If Hilliard went to Crouch's after his mail, Deerford, 
seated on the fence with his adherents gloating 

<!-- page 187 -->

admiration in his face, defied him with a swift
glance to enter the circle, or to draw away one of
its members. If he rode to Skipton or Rassler,
he found Deerford there before him, as free of
every respectable office and counting-room in the
place as he was of low dive and common bar-room. 
If he galloped along the Branch road at
night, or in the early morning, in the hope of
catching a glimpse of Helen, he met Deerford
riding also, or walking with the light springy step
peculiar to him, shouldering his rifle, or swinging
his slender cane. And the studied and exquisite
politeness of his enemy, for such he no longer
hesitated to name him to himself, made it impossible 
for him to come to honest blows with him, as
he longed to do.</p>

<p>"If he would only give me a chance, so that
I could measure paces with him!" he raged inwardly, 
aware at the same time that the only
weapons fit for this combat were those hammered
on the same anvil and taken from the same nail
as Deerford's own.</p>

<p>Meantime, as already remarked, his inner
strength grew, his youthful vanity was transmuted
into manly self-respect, his self-control became
at length so perfect that he could look into Deerford's 
face with a smile as inscrutable as his own,
and without a touch of color to throw the birthmark 
on his cheek into telltale relief.</p>

<p>"He will be there Christmas Eve, also," he
mused. "But let him! Helen will be there,

<!-- page 188 -->

too!" Then aloud, "Two thousand and eight&mdash;
nine"&mdash;</p>

<p>His reckoning was hardly up to the mark. But
Mr. Wyatt was not critical; his thoughts, too,
had been far a-field. "Them mile-posts is plum
out of place," he remarked, when they finally
halted and turned at the Skipton cross-road.
"They'll all have to be changed ag'in."</p>

<p>"I reckon yo' convincements an' principles is
right, Roy," he said ruefully, at parting. "But
I mistrus' you'll be mighty onpopular with the
boys. An' I be durn ef Deerford ain't gallopin'
'em straight to the devil."</p>

<br/>

<p>Christmas Eve closed in clear and cold. The
twigs and branches of the trees were still cased
in the sleet which had fallen the day before; the
moonlight made them glitter like so many crystal
wands. There were icicles depending from the
eaves of Crouch's front porch, and the well-bucket
on the stone cover of the well was incrusted with
several layers of ice. The still night air under
the pecan-trees and among the saplings across the
road was foggy with the breath of many horses.
These champed their bridle-bits, or munched corn
from feed-troughs behind the wagons drawn up
in line.</p>

<p>The front door of the house stood wide open; a
fan-shaped glow streamed from it into the crisp
darkness outside. Every stick of furniture had
been removed from the single large living-room;

<!-- page 189 -->

chairs were brought in between the dances, but
only for the older women; it was considered almost
disgraceful for a girl to sit down as long as a fiddle
scraped.</p>

<p>A medley of bedding, sleeping babies, groceries,
and other odds and ends, including Uncle Sam's
candle-box, strewed the floor of the upper room,
and was heaped upon the stairs. A fire of misshapen 
but rich mesquit roots and stumps roared
in the ample fireplace. In a corner of the hearth,
Johnny Giles, weak in political principles, but
sound as to catgut and rosin, was fiddling adorably; 
he had a heavenly smile on his lean face, and
minded not that the nail keg on which he sat had
but the suggestion of a cover. Billy Crouch was
threading the big double quadrille with a radiant
look; he was not dancing, but giving his soft little
hands to his guests in rapturous greeting, and reminding 
one and all that supper would soon be
ready. In fact, Mrs. Crouch, with Mrs. Wyatt
and the Mrs. Parsons, was in the kitchen, which
was set well back in the yard, frying chicken,
boiling the candy, and setting the sillabubs to cool,
in the torch-lit back-yard.</p>

<p>Hilliard made his way directly to Margaret
Ransome. "I have been looking for you," she
said, standing up with him for the dance; "I was
beginning to fear you might not come."</p>

<p>"Oh no!" he returned, looking over at Helen
who was just stepping into place with Jack Ransome. 
He thought he had never seen her look so

<!-- page 190 -->

beautiful. She wore a gown of soft white woolen
stuff; a wreath of bamboo berries with their dark
green glistening leaves crowned her hair. There
was no constraint in the face she turned toward
her partner; she smiled on him with frank friendliness; 
he bent over her, smiling back; and Hilliard 
noticed that for the first time in many weeks
the lad's eyes were limpid and his speech clear.
"How well Jack looks!" he cried involuntarily.</p>

<p>Margaret's eyes sparkled. "Does he not!" she
exclaimed fondly. Many a time afterward, both
recalled the boy as he looked that night in his dark
blue white-embroidered woolen blouse, his tasseled
boots drawn up over his trousers, and the scarlet
silk Mexican banda, or sash, knotted around his
waist.</p>

<p>"Does he not!" cried Margaret again. Margaret 
herself looked like some graceful tropical
bird, flashing in and out among the dancers in her
crimson dress, with great clusters of red-haws on
her bosom and in her blue-black braids of hair.</p>

<p>"I wanted to tell you," she said, poising lightly
again by her partner, "that Helen is leaving the
day after to-morrow, for home. Yes," for Hilliard 
had uttered an exclamation of surprise and
dismay, "she has received letters calling her back
at once. We are much distressed, for she had
promised, you know, to stay with us until spring.
You must speak to her as soon as you can," she
concluded significantly, "for we shall go home
early. We came with Mrs. Red in her wagon."</p>

<!-- page 191 -->

<p>"If I had not been sure you would be here," she
resumed, when a figure of the quadrille brought
them again to their places, "I would have come
over to tell you, even if I had had to make it a
night ride." She smiled at him kindly.</p>

<p>"How good you are to me, Margaret," he said
softly. But he was scarcely aware of what he was
saying. His whole soul was rilled with one desire,
one determination,&mdash;to get a moment's speech with
Helen. He approached her as soon as the fiddler,
with a flourish of his bow, gave the order, "Seat
your ladies,"&mdash;the signal, not for sitting down, but
for a laughing interchange of partners.</p>

<p>"Will you put this on, Miss Helen," he said
boldly; he handed her a woolen shawl which he had
caught up from the stair, "and come out on the
porch for a breath of air?" The pretext was flimsy
enough, but it served. She took his arm without
hesitation, and they stepped out upon the porch.
"I hear that you are going away," he began, in a
low agitated tone, when they had taken a turn or
two up and down the small gallery. "I had intended&mdash; 
Under different circumstances, I should
not, at this time, say what I am about to say"&mdash;he 
paused, feeling her hand tremble on his arm.
"But, you surely understand why I cannot let you
go away without telling you&mdash;oh, Helen, you
know that I love you! Wait, I do not ask any
confession, any pledge from you, or any answer
even, now. I only ask you if I may come to you,
at your own home, in the course of a few months,

<!-- page 192 -->

and there,&mdash;and then "&mdash;He paused again; the
long-repressed feeling threatened to burst all
bounds; he recovered control of himself with difficulty. 
At length he asked quietly, "May I come,
Helen?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the answer came almost in a whisper.
Under the many eyes which were following them
curiously, or sympathetically, Hilliard dared do no
more than touch quickly and furtively with his own
the ungloved hand on his arm. The touch thrilled
them both, with the sweetness of a first caress. To
Hilliard it was the seal of a betrothal to be kept
sacred so long as life should warm his veins.</p>

<p>"I do not know why I am called home," Helen
said presently. "My mother's letter was strangely
reticent. I fear something is wrong, although she
reassures me as to her own health. For some reasons, 
I am glad to go&mdash;to get away"&mdash;a slight
shiver ran through her frame. "But, I am much
troubled at leaving Mrs. Ransome and Margaret.
Oh, Mr. Hilliard, Roy," her voice sank to a tremulous 
whisper, "can you do nothing to rescue Jack
Ransome from&mdash;if you only knew!&mdash;if you could
but understand!"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do. I do!" said Hilliard tenderly. "And
I promise you, by my love"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Helen," said Jack, appearing in the doorway, 
"where are you? Oh!" he looked with pretended 
surprise at Hilliard. "Aren't you afraid
to trust yourself out there with&mdash;ah, allow me to
protect you!"</p>

<!-- page 193 -->

<p>"Miss Wingate," said Hilliard calmly, ignoring
the speaker, "will you go in now? I will claim
my dance, if you are not too fatigued." She lifted
her pale proud face to his, and laid her hand
frankly in his outstretched palm. Then, unfastening 
a spray of bamboo-berries from her wreath,
she gave it to him with a smile, and swept haughtily 
past Ransome, without so much as a glance in
his direction, into the house.</p>

<p>Here something unusual was taking place. The
guests were all pressed back against the wall, leaving 
an open place on the bare floor. Hilliard,
attending Helen, pushed forward to the front row,
where he found himself for the first time that evening 
in close proximity to Deerford's own particular
gang. Even through the glow of hope and happiness 
which enveloped him like a rosy cloud he
could not but observe the added disfavor with which
some of these men eyed him. He remembered
Uncle Joe's prophecy! He shrugged his shoulders
and smiled. What did their hatred or their goodwill 
matter at any time? And now! What does
a king care for the fretful grinding of the dust
beneath his throne? For a time, elbow to elbow
with his detractors, he saw nothing but the blissful
dreams which floated before his inner vision. But
the silence around him finally aroused him. He
looked up.</p>

<p>Johnny Giles, with his head laid low on his fiddle-neck, 
was playing&mdash;not one of the gay, rattling
tunes to which Crouch's Settlement joyed to foot

<!-- page 194 -->

it, but a soft dreamy melody which filled the room
like a supernatural whisper; even the leap of the
yellow flames could be heard above it, and the
quick breathing of the men and women, who leaned
forward, listening, and gazing with fascinated eyes
at Deerford.</p>

<p>Deerford had stepped without warning into the
middle of the room; the company at a significant
wave of his hand had fallen back. Giles as if
under a spell had drawn his bow gently across the
strings of his wonderful violin.</p>

<p>And Deerford was dancing!</p>

<p>No one present had ever seen anything like it.
His feet made no more than a whispering sound on
the floor, though clad in the regulation boots. His
lithe body swayed first to one side and then to the
other with a stealthy cat-like grace; his arms were
slowly outstretched, with the slender white fingers
curved inward to the palms of his hands; his eyelids 
were lowered until only a line of light gleamed
through the dark lashes; the swaying motion became 
slower and slower until it ceased, and the
slender figure stood motionless, yet instinct with
unrest. Then bounding rapidly forward, he
crouched with his shoulders drawn together until
his head nearly touched the floor,&mdash;"like a cougar
smellin' blood" Bagley declared afterward,&mdash;and
springing backward, he resumed his rhythmic undulatory 
movements. His eyes suddenly opened
wide, emitting flashes of living flame from their
dilated pupils&mdash;or so it seemed to the spell-bound

<!-- page 195 -->

circle about him; his lips were curved in an inscrutable 
smile.</p>

<p>The hilt of the little dagger in his belt, catching
the firelight, glittered like a diamond spark.</p>

<p>Hilliard's first feeling was one of supreme disgust. 
To this succeeded, in spite of himself, wonder 
and admiration; for the performance and the
performer were alike weirdly and strangely beautiful. 
Then, without warning, he found himself
struggling with a memory&mdash;or, not a memory, but
one of those unaccountable suggestions which had
stirred several times of late below the threshold of
consciousness and tugged like half-drowned creatures 
for recognition. He seemed to feel rather
than see, hovering above the oscillating figure before 
him, a small lightly clad child, with a crown of
roses on its sunny head, swaying and smiling and
tossing its little hands.</p>

<p>He drew a long breath as the vision faded. The
music at the same moment died away into something 
like an involuntary moan. Deerford stopped;
his arms dropped heavily, his eyes closed as if
overcome with languor, his yellow curls quivered,
as if blown by some mysterious wind.</p>

<p>There was an interval of dazed silence, then the
men rushed upon him with a shout of savage delight, 
lifted him to their shoulders, and bore him
out into the moonlight. He submitted to their
boisterous greetings, seemingly as impassive as an
oriental god, on his improvised throne. But as he
passed Hilliard, he glanced down at him and Helen,

<!-- page 196 -->

who were standing close together, and a malignant
scowl darkened his brow.</p>

<p>In a few moments, a gay medley of song and
laughter floated out from the kitchen, where the
hero of the evening and his followers were at supper.</p>

<p>Meantime great platters of molasses candy had
been set on the tables out in the yard, and the
young folk were already dabbing their palms and
fingers with butter and flour preparatory to attacking 
the red-hot, sticky mass.</p>

<p>Hilliard lent a hand here, with Margaret and
Helen. The scene remained graven on his memory, 
and often came back to him in after years.
The moon was just dropping behind the sombre
line of woods skirting Crouch's field, the wind had
risen, and a few clouds were gathering and scurrying 
across the sky. The ice-clad branches of the
pecan-trees rattled in the fitful gusts that whipped
around the corner of the house, and flared to and
fro the smoky torches on their stands. The cold
was intense, but no one seemed to mind. The yard
was filled with brightly-clad figures which flitted
to and fro; there were bursts of loud laughter, cries
of pain, affected or real, around the fiery platters,
shrill remonstrances from those who were getting
too little of the contents, shouts of dismay from
those who had got too much; weavings of arms and
hands over and under the yellow ropes that quickly
became cold and brittle in the night air. And
above all the joyous tumult the sound of Johnny
Giles's dance-tunes within! Hilliard, laughing into

<!-- page 197 -->

the laughing faces of Helen and Margaret who
"pulled" with him, had quite forgotten Deerford,
until looking up from the amber-colored loop flung
toward him by Helen, he saw him pass stealthily,
as if wishing to escape for once from his noisy companions, 
across the yard toward the front gate, and
disappear in the darkness.</p>

<p>A little later, Hilliard helped Red Parsons harness 
his horses, and assisted the two girls, with
Mrs. Red and all her brood&mdash;from Bud to little
Margaret&mdash;into the wagon, and watched them
drive off. He pressed Helen's hand at parting.
"I will ride over to Skipton with you, Monday,"
he said significantly.</p>

<p>When he re&euml;ntered the house, he noted with
some surprise that although Deerford had gone
Jack had remained, and was among the dancers.
He himself stepped off a reel with Lorena Crouch,
who, secretly adoring him, was so dazzled by this
unexpected and un-hoped-for honor, that she
stumbled over her own feet, trod on her partner's
toes, and suffered agony in trying to find something 
to say. He smiled at her kindly, as he
handed her in at the kitchen door, and bade her
good-night. "He's wo'th a million o' caperin'
monkeys, Roy Hilliard is," remarked Mrs. Crouch,
dropping a well-floured chicken-leg into the frying-pan.</p>

<p>Lorena retired into a corner to wipe the tears of
gladness from her eyes. "And Miss Helen is a
plum an&mdash;an&mdash;gel," she sobbed irrelevantly to
herself.</p>

<!-- page 198 -->

<p>Meantime, the object of her worship was cantering 
homeward, glad to be alone at last with the
thoughts of his assured happiness.</p>

<p>It was long past midnight; the moon had gone
down, and the gathering clouds had quite obscured
the stars, when Hector, dropping into a swift
walk, began to descend the sloping bank which
led to the creek bed in front of Hilliard's house;
he stumbled a little, and his rider, aroused from
a pleasant reverie, lifted his head. He became
instantly alert. His watch dog, Bruce, was barking 
furiously and with the peculiar intonation
which said as plainly as words to his master's ear
that a stranger was somewhere about. Reining
up his horse, he sat motionless, straining his eyes
forward in the darkness. He could dimly descry
the low irregular outlines of the house beyond the
rise of the opposite bank, against the sullen sky.
There was no one on the premises, he knew,
Manuel and Juan having gone to Skipton that
afternoon with a load of loose cotton, not to return
until the next day. The challenging bark of the
dog continued. Hilliard threw himself from the
saddle, leaving the well-trained horse standing
unfastened, and ran across the dry creek bank
and up the opposite slope. A tiny flash of light&mdash;in 
summer-time it might have been the bluish
sparkle of a firefly&mdash;shone for an instant somewhere 
between the dark masses of house and
stable, danced about fitfully, and disappeared.
He crept cautiously and noiselessly to the front

<!-- page 199 -->

gate; it was unlatched, open. He slipped in,
expecting to be greeted at once by Bruce's caressing 
whine, for the barking had ceased abruptly;
his finger was on the trigger of his pistol.</p>

<p>At the corner of the porch, he stepped upon a
soft yielding mass, which he divined instantly to
be the still quivering body of his dog. At the
same moment, a sheet of flame ran like heat-lightning 
over one of the larger cotton-pens in the rear
of the stable-yard. It died down, smouldered red,
and shot up again.</p>

<p>Hilliard leaped with a single bound past the
burning cotton, and gripped the shoulder of a
man who was loping swiftly across the lot, with
his knees bent, and his head to the ground. At
the touch, Deerford stood upright, whirled, and
closed silently with his pursuer. The assault was
so sudden that Hilliard had no chance, had he
been so minded, to use his pistol. Neither could
Deerford draw back his arm for a deadly thrust,
as he endeavored to do. Hilliard's iron grasp
was on his wrist; the bones of his forearm cracked,
the dagger, dripping with Bruce's life-blood,
dropped to the ground. He made a feint of yielding, 
and as his antagonist stepped back, he sprang
upon him, grappling him in a close embrace, fairly
twining his lithe slender body around his foe, and
trying to strangle him with his long fingers. For
a moment Hilliard was powerless; then, with an
effort he wrenched himself free, and twisting his
hand in Deerford's collar, he forced him inch by

<!-- page 200 -->

inch back upon his knees. He felt the convulsive
rattle in the throat against his knuckles. He
could see by the glare of the burning cotton the
figure writhing helpless at his knee, with the head
fallen backward, the blue eyes starting from their
sockets.</p>

<p>Suddenly his grasp relaxed; he bent hurriedly,
and laid his hand over Deerford's heart; he caught
the limp hands in his own and chafed them anxiously. 
The vision had reappeared with startling
clearness, and hovered above the backward bent
head&mdash;the lightly-clad form of a little child, rose-wreathed, 
dancing and clapping its hands.</p>

<p>"<i>Allan!</i>" he had heard himself whisper as in
a dream.</p>

<p>No audible word had been spoken during the
brief struggle. The prostrate man arose to his
feet, panting and trembling. Hilliard stooped
mechanically, picked up the bloody dagger, and
handed it to him. They stood staring at each
other, the one with dazed eyes, as if he had hardly
regained consciousness; the other, with a strange
unnatural feeling of helplessness.</p>

<p>In one instant, however, the color flowed back
into Deerford's pale cheeks; he lifted his head
and shook his shoulders slightly; the light mocking 
expression returned to his eyes. "Come!" he
cried gayly, "it is high time we were putting out
that fire." He ran toward the burning pen, and,
running, he pulled off his heavy overcoat.</p>

<p>The cotton, partly protected by the rails of

<!-- page 201 -->

which the open pen was built, and crusted with
sleet and ice, had burned but slowly. It was only
at the moment when Deerford approached it that
the flames, eating into the dry fleece underneath,
began to blaze up fiercely. He climbed up the
sides of the pen, graceful in this as in everything
he did&mdash;threw the overcoat upon the mounting
flames, and began tearing off the top rails. These
fell smoking at Hilliard's feet before he had recovered 
himself sufficiently to lend assistance.
His hands were scorched and Deerford's wrists
badly blistered when the fire, after a short but
sharp tussle, was finally extinguished. He felt
painfully the grotesqueness of the situation, when
they two stood facing each other again, in a darkness 
faintly illuminated by a pile of smouldering
rails.</p>

<p>"Mr. Deerford," he began, stiffly and awkwardly, 
"I"&mdash;</p>

<p>Deerford interrupted him. "Oh," he said airily,
"without knowing exactly what you are about to
say, Mr. Hilliard, I will risk the remark that you
cannot very well thank me for helping you put out
a fire which I myself kindled!"</p>

<p>"At least I can thank you for the remark, Mr.
Deerford," said Hilliard grimly. "And now"&mdash;</p>

<p>"And now you will thank me if I will stand
not on the order of my going, but go at once," he
interrupted again quickly. "You are quite right.
I will relieve you of my presence immediately.
But one thing more, if you will permit me. And
that is"&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 202 -->

<p>A tongue of flame broke out on the charred rail
at his feet; it brought his face into full relief as
he leaned forward. He was smiling contemptuously.</p>

<p>"And that is, Mr. Hilliard, that you have won
the game very cheaply. A few pounds of cotton,
a burnt rail or two, a worthless watch dog"&mdash;</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Hilliard, stirred
by the tone to a frenzied desire to seize the man
again by the throat.</p>

<p>"What do I mean! Could anything be clearer,
if only one chose to comprehend? You tell the
story&mdash;eloquently, as becomes a fledgling of the
law&mdash;at Crouch's, to-morrow. A midnight attempt 
to destroy your property by fire, your own
magnanimous conduct, generosity versus villainy,
and the gaping, imbecile, unlicked cubs will hurrah
at your heels, as they now do at mine. Victory
number one. You pour the tale&mdash;with romantic
additions&mdash;into the ears of the fair Helen; she
drops like the heroine of Troy into the arms of
her Paris. Victory number two. The fair
Helen"&mdash;</p>

<p>"You scoundrel!" cried Hilliard, choking with
rage, "if you dare to take Miss Wingate's name
again upon your evil lips, I will shoot you, like
the dog that you are!"</p>

<p>"I have finished," said Deerford imperturbably.
"Only I repeat that you have purchased these important 
victories at a very low price."</p>

<p>There was an undercurrent of anxiety in his

<!-- page 203 -->

voice which cooler senses would have detected.
Hilliard was too much shaken to note it. He fell
an easy prey to the ruse.</p>

<p>"I shall not mention this particular piece of
rascality, if that is what you are driving at," he
said angrily.</p>

<p>"You are a man of your word," responded
Deerford quickly, "and I hold you to this promise."</p>

<p>"I see no reason why I should keep faith with
a rogue," returned Hilliard with growing impatience; 
"nevertheless, you are at liberty, so far
as I am concerned, to hold your supremacy&mdash;wherever 
you can. I warn you, however, to keep
out of my way after this. Now go&mdash;while you
may."</p>

<p>Deerford's tongue for once seemed to have lost
its readiness. He turned and walked slowly across
the lot toward the back gate, where his horse was
stamping fretfully.</p>

<p>"Mr. Deerford!" Hilliard's voice arrested him.
"Your overcoat I see is ruined. The night is
very cold. Will you allow me to offer you one of
mine?"</p>

<p>"No, I thank you. A rapid ride homeward
will keep me warm. Good-night, Mr. Hilliard."</p>

<p>"Good-night."</p>

<p>Both men had dropped unconsciously into the
courteous speech and tone of ordinary intercourse.</p>

<p>"All this is past belief," Hilliard mused, standing 
stock still, and listening to the flying hoof-beats 

<!-- page 204 -->

on the hard road. "But I can understand
him, complex as he is, better than I can understand 
myself. I know why he hates me; I can
partly see why his hatred goes far enough to wish
to burn my property. But I? Well, I suppose I
am a quixotic fool! Did a man, caught red-handed,
as it were, ever before dictate and receive terms
in such easy fashion!" He laughed under his
breath. "Well; and can I not afford everything&mdash;anything&mdash;now!" 
he exclaimed, after a pause,
"now that Helen is really mine!"</p>

<p>He drew water from the well, and dashed it
over the half-consumed cotton-pen, as a last precaution, 
and extinguished the still burning rails.
Then whistling for Hector, he walked out toward
the front gate. At the corner of the porch he
stooped to draw the stiffening body of his dog out
of the path. "Poor faithful Bruce," he muttered,
tears filling his eyes. "Worthless!"&mdash;the expression, 
unnoted at the time, recurred to him all
at once&mdash;"worthless! Why did I not strangle
the lying villain when I had the chance!" he cried
in a fury. "Poor devil," he added, softening
again, "let him go. He does not know&mdash;yet&mdash;how 
much he has lost!"</p>

<p>XII</p>

<p class="small">IN PELEG CHURCH</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> grotesqueness of the situation struck him
more forcibly still the following Monday, when he
found himself riding to Skipton beside the open
wagonette driven by Deerford. Nothing in the
handsome face turned from time to time in his
direction betrayed the faintest recollection of the
scene through which they had so recently passed.
The bright unembarrassed greeting of his avowed
enemy threw Hilliard himself into momentary confusion, 
and he colored up to the eyes when Margaret 
demanded merrily, "Why, what have you
been doing, since we saw you, Mr. Hilliard? You
look as if you were hiding a crime!"</p>

<p>"I am!" he laughed, really amused at the reach
of this random shot.</p>

<p>Deerford, who was handing Helen to her place
on the back seat of the wagonette, laughed also,
easily and audaciously, with a malicious side glance
at his foe.</p>

<p>The drive seemed very short through the woodland 
and across the dry prairie strewn with the
bleached bones of dead cattle. The fences cut
by Hilliard in June had never been restored; the

<!-- page 206 -->

cedar posts with the rusted wire trailing from
them still dotted the wind-swept plateau. He
glanced at one of these, overthrown and lying near
a certain bend in the road, then his eyes instinctively 
sought those of Deerford; they seemed utterly 
vacant of rancor, or acknowledgment.</p>

<p>Helen maintained during the drive the curious
reserve habitual to her in Deerford's presence.
But this no longer disturbed Hilliard, sure at last
of his own place in her heart; he talked but little
himself, but feasted his eyes in rapturous content
on her graceful figure and her lovely face, rosy
with the whipping of the north wind. Margaret,
too, was silent and seemingly oppressed by some
secret anxiety. Deerford chattered incessantly,
urging the horses to a furious speed the while, yet
handling them with a skill and grace which provoked 
even Hilliard's unwilling admiration.</p>

<p>They stopped near the outskirts of the little
town of Skipton, at Mrs. Temperance Holloway's
Tavern, a queer-looking house, half-log, half-box,
the more substantial part dating from earlier times,
when Pap Holloway had to fort himself against
Comanche Indians. Aunt Tempy herself, a fat,
comfortable-looking old body, came out to meet
them. " 'Light. 'Light. Git right down an'
come in," she cried. "You've got oodles o' time.
The stage don't start for haff 'n hour. Howdy,
Margaret. Howdy, Roy."</p>

<p>"How are you, Aunt Tempy?" said Hilliard
heartily, "and how is Mr. Holloway?"</p>

<!-- page 207 -->

<p>"Oh, pap's a-movin'. An' yaller-dog poor,
ez common." She laughed, and waddled back to
the house, shooing them all before her like a
motherly hen. Deerford stopped in the gallery
to give some directions about the horses; Margaret
was borne off to an inner room to convey particular 
instructions concerning some yeast Mrs. Ransome 
had sent over to Mrs. Holloway. Hilliard
found himself alone with Helen for one moment in
the small prim tavern parlor. The unexpectedness
of this good fortune deprived him of speech. He
could only gaze with dumb craving into the violet
eyes lifted to his.</p>

<p>"Is it really true?" he breathed at length.
"Tell me that I am not dreaming, Helen! Helen!
I am to come to you in the spring? I am to woo
you in your own home, and win you, my beautiful
darling? Forgive me, forgive me, if I say too
much!"</p>

<p>"In the early spring," she corrected, smiling
shyly.</p>

<p>He seized her hand and pressed it ardently.
"And, until then? Until then, my Helen?"</p>

<p>"You will hear from me through Margaret,"
she returned. He had been hoping for encouragement 
to write to her, and longing for her promise
to answer his letters. She divined his disappointment. 
"I think we can trust each other, even if
we do not hear at all from each other," she said
quickly. In her heart she feared that Deerford,
if he knew that letters were exchanged between

<!-- page 208 -->

herself and her lover&mdash;and what letters were
sacred in Billy's candle-box!&mdash;that Deerford
might work mischief. Hilliard dared not urge
his petition. Instead, he resolved within himself
to see her before the early spring! He said as
much, hurriedly, for he heard footsteps and voices
in the hall outside. "I will be glad," she said
frankly. "And, oh Roy," she added, with great
earnestness, "remember your pledge to save Jack,
if you can&mdash;<i>from him</i>."</p>

<p>"I will remember everything," he said. There
was no time for further speech, or for private
leave-taking. Mrs. Holloway burst in with the
announcement that the stage was coming. Hilliard
folded Helen's wraps around her and followed her,
with the others, to the gate. The lumbering big-bodied 
stage had already swung up; the staid
elderly couple, man and wife, in whose company
she was to make the homeward journey were already 
seated within, together with two or three
other passengers.</p>

<p>As the vehicle started with a jerk and rolled
away, the driver executing an uncertain tune on
his battered horn, Hilliard turned to Margaret,
who leaned over the low fence, looking after it
with streaming eyes. He would have liked to
take her in his arms! They seemed to bring her
so near to him, those tears shed over Helen's departure. 
"It is more than that," she confessed,
in answer to his burst of sympathy. "I shall
miss her sadly. I can hardly imagine the passing

<!-- page 209 -->

days, the house, myself, without her dear presence.
But"&mdash;she glanced around, and seeing that they
were quite alone in the bare little yard, she went
on. "It is foolish, perhaps, to put the feeling
into words. But I have had lately, I know not
why, a sense of impending danger, a presentiment
of coming evil. Oh, I know well enough what
you would say! that these forebodings generally
have no significance at all, and that in this case
they are but prophecies of the loneliness and heartache 
I shall surely feel. My reason tells me you
are right, but something deeper than reason warns
me that some terrible calamity is hovering over
Helen&mdash;something, perhaps, that will befall her
on this journey."</p>

<p>He laughed outright. "If that were true," he
said meaningly, "do you not think <i>I</i> would be
overwhelmed with forebodings?"</p>

<p>"You have spoken to her, then?" she asked
quickly. "And she has shown you her heart? I
guessed as much from what she herself told me.
God bless you, Roy, my friend, my brother! You
have made a noble choice&mdash;and so has she!"
She smiled as she added the last words, putting
out her hand and looking bravely in his face. If
she had grown a shade paler, he was too blinded
by his own happiness to perceive it.</p>

<p>"I will tell you all about it&mdash;about us, at the
first opportunity," he said, clasping her hand.
"So you see that your apprehensions cannot mean
anything. But I do not wonder that you are sad!

<!-- page 210 -->

Where can Deerford be with the wagonette?
Shall I"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh," she interposed, "I am not going back
home just yet. I am to do some shopping for my
mother. And Bud Parsons is to drive me home.
He brought over Mr. Deerford's horse. I would
not go back with <i>him</i>&mdash;for worlds!"</p>

<p>"Where is Jack?" asked Hilliard, who had
not heard the last half-whispered remark.</p>

<p>"He stayed at home with mother. I&mdash;I think
Jack is coming back to himself, Roy. He has
been different this last day or two. A little silent
and gloomy, perhaps, but gentle and affectionate.
Oh, more like he was before&mdash;more like the dear
old Jack, Roy."</p>

<p>Her lip quivered and she turned away her head.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack will come out all right, Margaret,
don't worry," he said with conviction. "And I
do not think Deerford will linger here&mdash;now."</p>

<p>"I suppose he will follow Helen," Margaret
sighed. "You are not afraid of his influence upon
her?" She asked the question involuntarily.</p>

<p>He lifted his head proudly. "She has given
me her word," he said with simple earnestness.</p>

<p>Margaret clenched her hands nervously under
her cloak. "I wish he could realize as I do," she
thought, "what a spell-like sway Deerford has
over her. But I dare not say more, now!"</p>

<p>He walked with her to the plaza of the town,
and left her at the entrance of one of the squatty
stores. The open square was filled with wagons,

<!-- page 211 -->

mud-bespattered hacks, and saddle-horses. Among
the last, hitched to a post, he recognized Jack
Ransome's Black Prince, which Deerford usually
rode. Deerford himself was sitting on the curb of
the town-well with a knot of countrymen around
him. As Hilliard passed the group, he heard one
of the men in a burst of enthusiasm urging the
young stranger to allow his name to be "put up"
as a candidate for governor of the State!</p>

<br/>

<p>That night, sitting alone before his crackling
mesquit fire, he heard the signal-shot that announced 
the gathering in Blackbird Gully of Deerford 
and his gang. He remembered for one moment 
the big raid, whose leadership Uncle Joe
had offered him, on the part of the "boys." He
smiled disdainfully; his eyes went back to the
dancing flames, and his thoughts to Helen! Helen!</p>

<p>Sometime, toward daylight, it began to rain.
The clouds had been accumulating for weeks, and
all that day and the next, and a part of the next,&mdash;which 
was Thursday,&mdash;the heavens seemed
not to weary an instant of pouring forth their garnered 
and repressed floods, or the earth, parched
by more than six months of continuous drought,
of receiving them.</p>

<p>The creek, long before a patch of blue sky overhead 
announced a truce, was roaring and seething
between its banks, and where the land was low,
swelling far beyond them. Hilliard congratulated
himself and Manuel that the last wagon-load of

<!-- page 212 -->

cotton had gone to the Skipton gin, and the whole
crop, ginned and baled, awaited transportation
under shelter there.</p>

<p>Late Thursday afternoon, he rode over to
Crouch's Well. He told himself that he was expecting 
a letter from Mrs. Blackmore, as indeed
he was, but in his secret soul he thought it conceivable 
that Helen might have sent him a line
from the nearest post-office on her route. He
measured her impatience by his own, and he did
not believe that she would hold to her resolution
of not writing. He could not afford not to get
this letter at the first moment possible. It was
necessary to swim his horse across Mesquit. This
was accomplished at the expense only of a dripping 
mane and tail for Hector.</p>

<p>At Crouch's he found but a handful of men.
These, seated stoically on the wet fence-rails, were
fortifying themselves against the cold by draughts
from individual whiskey-flasks, or requisitions upon
the joint-stock jug, which stood ready, uncorked,
upon the edge of the horse-trough. Among the
loiterers were Deerford and Jack Ransome. The
subject of conversation at the moment was evidently 
an uncomfortable one, for Hilliard noted
an open anxiety on their faces. The topic, whatever 
it was, was dropped at his approach.
"Where's your horse, Jack?" demanded Tom
Roper, by way of bridging over the awkward
silence.</p>

<p>"I did not ride over," replied Jack sullenly.

<!-- page 213 -->

Hilliard saw at once that he had been drinking
again. "I came over in the Skipton mail-hack,
and I am going back in the Rassler mail. It will
be along pretty soon, I reckon. Unless they are
stalled in the mud somewhere."</p>

<p>"Or gone sailing down Blackhaw Creek," suggested 
Waldrup facetiously.</p>

<p>Hilliard passed on into the house, and stood
looking feverishly on while Billy rummaged in the
candle-box for his mail. There was a package of
flower-seed, a pair of spurs, a letter from Aunt
Amanda, and a couple of magazines. Hilliard
took them, telling himself severely that this was
all that he had looked for, but he wondered if
Billy in his anxiety to get back to the "boys,"
had not overlooked Helen's letter!</p>

<p>"The boys has got themselves into a peck o'
trouble this time, I'm afeard, Roy," said Billy,
pushing the post-office back under the bed with
his foot.</p>

<p>"Have they? How?"</p>

<p>"I dunno exactly. Seems like they had a
scrimmage som'ers last night. This here wire-cuttin' 
has gone too fer, anyhow. I wisht to God
you'd take a-holt ag'in, Roy! Why, the post-office
is regular busted. The boys don't keer nothin'
'bout politics any more. The gover'mint at Austin, 
an' the United States Senate can set yander
an' do what they durn please, an' Crouch's Settlement 
goes postin' on its downward way, an' don't
even try to stop 'em! What do you think young

<!-- page 214 -->

Joe Wyatt said this mornin'? Said he didn't
give a damn <i>what they done about the revenoo!</i>"</p>

<p>Billy delivered himself of these gloomy reflections 
in a low tone, and with sundry uneasy glances
toward the half-open door. His round face was
clouded, the corners of his mouth drooped. He
looked like a grieved infant.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Hilliard, more cheerfully than he
felt, "don't fret, Billy. The boys will come
around."</p>

<p>When he came out of the house, he saw that
Jack was standing near the well, alone, and somewhat 
apart from his fellows. He went over to
him deliberately. "Jack," he said, but without
offering his hand, which he feared might be refused, 
"I wish you would come over to-morrow
and see me. I have got a brand new rifle which
I would like you to try."</p>

<p>Jack looked at him, his face assuming a dogged
expression, but made no answer.</p>

<p>"For the sake of old times, Jack!" Hilliard
persisted. "Come with me now. You haven't
your horse, but we will ride and tie, as we have
done many a time," he added gayly.</p>

<p>"Let me alone, d&mdash;n you!" shouted the lad,
shaking the friendly hand from his shoulder; "if
you don't, I know how to make you."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," Hilliard said curtly, turning
away, "I promise to let you well alone from this
time forward."</p>

<p>"I've a good notion to go after him and lick

<!-- page 215 -->

him yet," Ransome blustered, watching Hilliard
as he mounted and rode slowly off.</p>

<p>"Bully for you, Jack! Bully for you!" laughed
one of the men, winking broadly at his companions. 
"A little game-cock like you can do up a
dozen yellow-legged Domineckers like Miss Mary-Ann 
Hilliard, yonder!"</p>

<p>"I'll do it!" cried Jack, delighted, and he
started running down the wet road.</p>

<p>"Don't forget to-night's business, Jack!" Deerford 
called after him.</p>

<p>He stopped a second and looked back over his
shoulder. "All right!" he cried; "I'll attend to
it," and ran on, shouting Hilliard's name.</p>

<p>"How will the boy get home?" Roper asked,
frowning a little, "he's half drunk."</p>

<p>"Oh," replied Deerford carelessly, "the mail-hack 
from Rassler will pick him up on the road,
if he does not come back here. Trust the Lord
to take care of a fool and a drunkard."</p>

<p>Hearing himself called, Hilliard drew up and
waited near the turn of the road. "Did you want
me?" he asked when Jack came up, stumbling
and panting; his young face was red and swollen,
his brown eyes were bloodshot.</p>

<p>"Yes, I want you," he said in a threatening
tone. "You can't buy me, Mr. Leroy Hilliard.
D&mdash;n your new rifle."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, Jack." Hilliard smiled in spite of
himself. "You don't mean that."</p>

<p>Jack looked up at him stupidly. He knitted

<!-- page 216 -->

his brows doubtfully; the anger suddenly vanished
from his face; he burst into a gay boyish laugh.
"I reckon I don't mean it," he chuckled; "but
if I don't, I swear I don't know what I've come
prancing through the mud after you for!"</p>

<p>He looked down at his muddy boots and laughed
again.</p>

<p>"Well, now that you are here," Hilliard said,
dismounting, and taking the bridle over his arm,
"come on home with me." A swift backward
glance showed him the expectant group at Crouch's.</p>

<p>"No," returned Jack, drawing away, "I can't.
I have some business to attend to to-night&mdash;in
Skipton. But I'll walk a little way with you&mdash;and 
if that gang of loafers don't like it, they can
lump it, that's all," he muttered between his
teeth.</p>

<p>They turned around a knoll which hid them
completely from the view of the men they had
left, and passed on into the post-oak rough. Neither 
spoke; the short winter day was drawing to
a close. The heavy clouds lying about the horizon
showed that the rain was not yet over. The woods
were so still that the sucking sound of their booted
feet on the soaked ground came echoing back
through the trees. They had tramped along for
over a mile in silence, and had reached the by-road
which led to Hilliard's place, when Jack stopped.</p>

<p>"Are you tired, Jack?" asked Hilliard kindly.
He had refrained from speech, fearful of changing
the boy's wayward mood. "Get into the saddle.
I am glad of a chance to stretch my legs."</p>

<!-- page 217 -->

<p>"No." Jack's voice sounded wistful in the
falling gloom. "I am not going home with you,
Roy. I&mdash;I&mdash;can't. I've got business"&mdash;</p>

<p>"What business?" urged Hilliard. "Let it
wait until to-morrow. Your lounge is waiting for
you, and some uncut magazines, and your pipe;
you haven't smoked that pipe for an age, you
young rascal! Come, boy; it's just the night for
a snug doze by the fire. If you think Mrs. Ransome 
and Margaret will be anxious, I will send
Manuel over to let them know where you are. Or
I will go on home with you now," he added, striving 
not to appear too anxious. A wave of tender
feeling swept over him. He felt half-tempted to
seize the boy by force, throw him on the horse, and
keep him a prisoner until his tempter should have
left the neighborhood.</p>

<p>"No! No! I tell you! Let me alone. I know
my own affairs better than you do."</p>

<p>The older man was silent, seeing the uselessness
of pleading any longer. "Anyway," he reflected,
"he will not have to cross the creek alone, for the
Rassler mail must be along in a few moments."</p>

<p>"All right, Jack," he said aloud, "but you
must come over soon, and try that rifle."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will," Jack returned, his good humor
bubbling up again. "And, I say, Roy, old fellow, 
you'll shake hands once more, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Shake hands! Of course!" He did more.
Moved by an irresistible impulse, he threw his arm
around the lad's shoulders and clasped him closely.

<!-- page 218 -->

He could not be sure, but he thought that a sob
shook the breast against his own. "You young
rascal!" he repeated, laughing to cover his own
unexpected emotion, "don't you ever dare to snub
me again&mdash;in public!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I won't," whispered the boy.</p>

<p>Hilliard mounted and rode away reluctantly,
turning his head from time to time, though the
darkness soon hid the motionless figure behind
him from sight.</p>

<p>When he had disappeared, Jack walked rapidly
back about a quarter of a mile, and turned into
a travel-beaten, wheel-rifted road, which bore off
to the left. He was completely sobered by the
chill air, and he made his way along through the
unbroken gloom like one familiar with his course.</p>

<br/>

<p>Abner Croft had that day dug a grave for old
Mrs. Barry, who lived several miles back of
Crouch's Well, near Bethesda Church. The heavy
rain had made the task a difficult one, for the
Bethesda graveyard was on level ground, and it
was the work of hours to keep the grave emptied
of water, and get it sufficiently deep to allow the
funeral to take place. The body was borne to its
last resting-place just at nightfall, and when Abner 
had filled in the dripping earth and patted the
muddy mound into shape with his spade, it was
too dark for the mourning relatives to distinguish
each other's faces. The last funeral hymn&mdash;the
wailing farewell to the dead&mdash;arose and floated

<!-- page 219 -->

weirdly away into the night. The singers groped
their way through the wet bushes to their wagons,
or their saddle-horses, and departed. It was a
part of the neighborhood etiquette for Abner to
wait until everybody had gone, before gathering
up his "tools" and leaving the dead alone under
the open sky.</p>

<p>He waited, therefore, keeping company with
old Mrs. Barry to the last. In his determination
to overcome his instinctive terror of the dead, he
forced himself to stay longer than was necessary;
then shouldering his pick and spade, he trudged
off afoot, chill to the bone. He never rode any
of the horses he raised, even to break them. He
respected a horse too much, he said, to force that
noble animal to carry a poor human sinner like
himself!</p>

<p>It was towards nine o'clock when he found himself 
in the neighborhood of Peleg Church on his
homeward journey. A few scattered drops of
rain were falling, and the wind, blowing in heavy
whirling gusts, presaged one of those violent clearing-up 
storms peculiar to the region. He stopped
in the narrow path and reflected, shifting his
grave-digging implements from the right shoulder
to the left. "It was all I could do to swim the
creek by daylight and keep clear of floating timber. 
Maybe she's run down some since, and
maybe she ain't. Anyhow I'm not going to resk
it, al<i>though</i> I'm the best swimmer and the best
diver in the Settlement. Old Ma'am Croft won't

<!-- page 220 -->

be expectin' me, considering of the weather. I
reckon I'd better put in at Peleg Church&mdash;until
moonrise, howsomever."</p>

<p>He walked on a few hundred yards and struck
into the beaten road to the church. A little later,
he pushed open the door, which was never fastened, 
stepped in and pushed it to again, shoving
against it with the toe of his boot the stone which
served as a drag.</p>

<p>"The darkness is cert'ny biled down in here,"
he muttered, feeling his way with outstretched
hands along the aisle to the pulpit. He ascended
the steps, and laying his spade and pick on the
preacher's bench, he faced about. The wooden
shutter of the window directly opposite the pulpit
had been wrenched from its fastenings by the
tempest, and hung loosely from one hinge; it
swayed and creaked in the blasts of wind which
swept around the corner of the building. The
rain dashed in spurts through the un-paned casement. 
Across the oblong square, not of light,
but of lesser darkness, the limb of a pecan-tree
outside seesawed, beating the low eaves with a
dismal sound. Above this, Abner could hear the
boom of the creek lashing its banks at No-Bottom
Pool.</p>

<p>"Even Brother French couldn't do much dippin' 
in Peleg Pool now," he mused aloud, leaning
his elbows on the edge of the box pulpit. "But
he'd cert'ny resk it, ef he thought God called him
to do it." Abner's admiration of the Reverend

<!-- page 221 -->

David since the night of the search for Red Parsons's 
child had been well-nigh as boundless as
that he accorded Hilliard. "An' the Lord'd
b'ar him up. Yes, the Lord'd b'ar him up!"
he continued, with solemn conviction, "less'n he
dash his foot aginst a rock. My bretheren, 'tain't
always the weak an' po' in body that's weak an'
po' in sperret," he went on, exhorting imaginary
hearers. "There's them settin' in the amen
corner, now, under the droppin's of this here pulpit 
that has the strenk of Brother Joe Wyatt's
black bull Peter, an' the livers of chickens. Jedge
not less'n ye be jedged, bretheren. I've got bull-strenk 
myself to dig a well, er a grave; I've got
strenk to raise a house, er swim a creek, an' yit
God knows I'm tremblin' this minute, an' I 'm
preachin' to you because I'm plum skeered, rememberin' 
of the graves I've dug, an' the corpses
I've kivered up out yander in Peleg Church
graveyard! I kin see Mr. Ransome's headstone
a-shinin' whenever it lightens!" His voice, fighting 
against the rain and hail that beat the roof,
and the wind that shrieked around the corners,
filled the empty church with echoes. He closed
his eyes and steadied himself with his hands resting 
on the big Bible. "Pray for me, my bretheren, 
an' ast the good Lord to he'p me git ole
Satan under my feet."</p>

<p>As he uttered the last words, the storm suddenly
abated; the rain ceased, easing off in a light patter
that ran like a child's footsteps over the shingles;

<!-- page 222 -->

the wind dropped; on the instant a watery moon-beam 
stole in through the window. Croft felt a
corresponding calm descend upon his own soul;
his terrors vanished. He leaned forward, still
clasping the Bible. "The congergation," he said,
"will now sing the forty-fo'th hymn, beginnin':&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">'Am I a soldier of the cross,<br/>

A follerer of the Lamb?'</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Brother Green Parsons will please raise the tune."
Abner's voice was clear, sweet, and sonorous; he
always sat on a back bench in Peleg among the
confessed sinners, but he never failed to join in
the singing. He cleared his throat and opened
his lips. Before a note had issued from them, the
rasping of the drag-stone on the floor gave warning 
that some one was pushing open the door from
the outside. He dropped to his knees, quaking
with fright. "Suppose the Lord is mad with me
because I have dast to preach in Peleg pul-<i>pit</i>
without a license!" he groaned inwardly. "Suppos'n 
He has sent ole Satan to drag me out'n the
pul-<i>pit</i> by the hair o' my head! Lord ha' mercy!
I didn't mean no disrespec'! Lord"&mdash;</p>

<p>Whoever, or whatever it was, was now stepping
across the threshold. There was a moment of
silence, then a stumble. "Oh, damn it!" Abner
breathed once more. He recognized the voice instantly, 
as belonging to Jack Ransome. His relief
was for one moment as paralyzing as his terror
had been. Then he opened his lips again&mdash;this
time to call out a friendly greeting to a water-bound 

<!-- page 223 -->

neighbor. But his keen ear caught the
sound of horses' feet beating the slushy road
softly. The drag grated again on the floor, and
Jack's light halloo rang out, evidently from the
threshold of the door. There was an immediate
answering halloo, and very soon the tread of entering 
feet. Uncertainty and curiosity kept Abner
silent. He was squatted on the pulpit floor with
his head crouched low. So far he had not even
tried to look out.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Jack?" He recognized this voice
also. It was Deerford's.</p>

<p>As he spoke, the newcomer, now within the
church, scraped a match, and through a crack in
the pulpit wall Croft saw him walk over to a table
which stood in a corner, shading the tiny flame
with his hand, and light one of the pulpit candles
which stood there in their flat tin candlesticks.</p>

<p>"What are they up to? Some devil<i>mint</i>, I'll
be bound," thought Abner, with his eye to the
crack. "Anyhow, I won't speak, onless they find
me."</p>

<p>He observed that the door remained open. The
moonlight was losing its watery pallor and becoming 
clear and white; the wind reached the corner
where the table stood, only in light puffs which
blew the yellow flame of the tallow-candle gently
to and fro. Ransome had seated himself side wise
on a bench; his broad-brimmed hat was pushed
back from his forehead; he had a distinctly sulky
look on his comely face. Deerford leaned against

<!-- page 224 -->

the wall with his hands thrust into the pockets
of his overcoat, looking at him with the air of a
master.</p>

<p>"Where is your horse?" he asked. "How did
you get here?"</p>

<p>"I walked," said Jack laconically; "that's
how."</p>

<p>"What the devil did you walk for?" demanded
Deerford. "I thought you were to go home in
the Rassler mail-hack, and ride over, as usual."</p>

<p>"You know why as well as I do, by G&mdash;d. I
have told you that I will never straddle one of my
horses again,&mdash;your horses, I mean. I'd rather
walk a thousand miles than back one of them."</p>

<p>"Pshaw, Jack, what a d&mdash;d young fool you
are!"</p>

<p>"I know I'm a fool, and I'm a tired, wet, hungry 
fool to boot. I've been tramping the woods
ever since I left Crouch's,&mdash;when I wasn't standing 
under a tree, praying God Almighty to strike
me dead with lightning!"</p>

<p>"How did you and Hilliard make it?" Deerford 
broke in curiously.</p>

<p>"None of your d&mdash;d business! Give me some
whiskey, if you've got any."</p>

<p>Deerford took a flask from his pocket and
handed it to him. From the other pocket he drew
a fresh pack of playing-cards, and began tearing
off the wrapping. "It is time the others were
here," he remarked, crumpling the paper in his
hand.</p>

<!-- page 225 -->

<p>"The others?" Jack took a long pull at the
flask, then rested it half-empty on his knee.
"They are not coming." He looked at his companion 
with ill-concealed triumph, as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Not coming!" echoed Deerford. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Why!" Jack laughed disagreeably. "Principally 
because you've got all any of them have to
lose, already!"</p>

<p>"If any man dares to hint that I have been
cheating," cried Deerford hotly, "I'll"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't overheat yourself, Mr. Deerford,"
sneered Jack, the fiery draught mounting to his
head. "You play fair enough&mdash;I reckon. But
you have extra&mdash;or&mdash;di&mdash;nary <i>luck</i>. That's all!
You own pretty near everything on Mesquit Creek,
in the way of land and horses. You ought to be
satisfied!"</p>

<p>"How do you know they are not coming?"
asked Deerford, ignoring the offense of words and
manner.</p>

<p>"Roper and Waldrup and young Joe told me
themselves to-day at Crouch's. The balance of
'em sent me word. I came myself only because
you happen to be my guest," continued the lad,
with an air of sullen pride.</p>

<p>Deerford uttered an exclamation of disdain; he
dropped the cards back into his pocket.</p>

<p>"Maybe you don't believe what I say!" said
Jack defiantly. "I don't care whether you believe 
it or not. You've raked in everything I
own in the world. I haven't even got a horse to

<!-- page 226 -->

ride here to play cards with you in Peleg Church!
Even the whiskey I am drinking belongs to you!"
He laughed a little bitterly, and handed the flask
with an exaggerated bow to Deerford, who slipped
it mechanically into his breast pocket.</p>

<p>"If you think it is any pleasanter for me to
come, under the circumstances, than it is for the
other boys, you are mightily mistaken. We've
played with you three times a week for the last
six months. You've run us all to the ground,&mdash;every 
one of us! The others can drop you. I
can't!"</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Jack Ransome," said Deerford 
roughly. "What do you suppose I want
with the raw-boned knock-kneed plough-horses of
Crouch's Settlement? I'd like to see the figure
they'd cut in Kentucky!" He laughed contemptuously. 
"And I don't want land that is too poor
to grow jimson weeds, either! I shall take your
brown filly, because she has carried the woman I
love. By the way, I have not mentioned, have I,
that I am leaving for home in a few days? And
I may keep an acre or two, here and there, out of
Roper's and Wyatt's bottom-land. Helen may
want to come out one of these days and spend a
summer, and I may build her a cottage somewhere
on the creek. But you may rest easy about the
rest of your stuff. And so may the others."</p>

<p>"Ah!" sneered Jack. "Is it possible! Why,
you are almost as generous as&mdash;as Hilliard!"</p>

<p>"Let Hilliard alone," retorted Deerford. "He

<!-- page 227 -->

is worth the whole clod-hopping ill-mannered pack
of you!"</p>

<p>"You are pretty late finding it out!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am. And I hate him; but he is a
gentleman, and that cannot be said of anybody
else in this settlement."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is a gentleman!" cried Jack coolly.
"And gentleman enough to do what you could not
do to save your soul from hell, and that is to win
Helen Wingate!"</p>

<p>"That is not true," said Deerford, looking at
him steadily; but the bantering sneer was gone
out of his voice.</p>

<p>"It is true. I heard her myself tell Margaret.
Poor Margaret," he whimpered, breaking down at
his own mention of her name. "The filly is hers,
and I've gambled it away. Poor Margaret! Poor
mother!"</p>

<p>"Helen Wingate cares nothing for Hilliard,"
persisted Deerford, coming close up to him, and
speaking between his teeth.</p>

<p>"Helen Wingate is engaged to Leroy Hilliard."</p>

<p>"You lie!" shouted Deerford, his face livid in
the pale light of the candle.</p>

<p>Without another word Jack leaped up and
sprang upon him. Abner saw the two men clinch.
Holding each other in a close embrace, they struggled 
violently and silently. They backed against
the table, jarring it; the candlestick rolled to the
floor and the light went out, leaving the place in
total darkness. Abner rose to his feet and stared

<!-- page 228 -->

over the pulpit in the direction of the combat.
There was a shuffling of heavily-booted feet on the
floor, an intermingling of quick, hard breathing,
then an indistinguishable mass appeared in the
shaft of moonlight near the open door, swayed to
and fro on the threshold, lurched forward, and
rolled down the steps. Abner slipped noiselessly
from his place of concealment and crept a few
paces down the aisle. Inarticulate cries of rage
floated in from where the men, locked together,
still fought like a pair of wild beasts on the muddy
sod outside. He ran back to the pulpit for his
grave-tools and shoved them under the pulpit-floor, 
where he had often left them before; then
he made his way to the window. He climbed, by
the aid of a bench, to the high sill and dropped
to the ground without. There he stooped and
crawled along the soggy ground to the corner of
the church, and crouched, staring and trembling,
under the still dripping eaves.</p>

<p>XIII</p>

<p class="small">THE RED BANDA</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Ransome's</span> absences from home had been
so frequent of late that his failure to return
Thursday night occasioned distress and anxiety
there, but no surprise. The skies by Friday morning 
had cleared, and a crisp tingling breeze had
succeeded to the stormy norther and the languid
dying wind of the night before; the sunshine lay
chill and sparkling over the leaf-strewn sod. It
was a day to rejoice in. Deerford, sitting before
a roaring fire in the cosy sitting-room at Mrs.
Ransome's, glanced up from his newspaper from
time to time, through the window and out to the
road, as if he expected some one. Each time his
eyes rested with a strained look on the silhouetted
branch of an althea which tapped the window-pane
like a warning finger. There were dark rings
under his eyes,&mdash;an unwonted sign of weariness
with him, and he shifted his body occasionally to
a more restful position in the easy-chair. But his
voice was clear and untouched by fatigue, as he
demanded of Margaret Ransome whether her brother 
had yet returned.</p>

<p>She had just entered the room, and she stood

<!-- page 230 -->

looking at him quietly a moment before answering.
"No," she said, "he has not. I thought&mdash;at
least I hoped&mdash;you might know something of him."
It cost her much to say this. It was the first time
she had ever, in Deerford's presence, seemed to
acknowledge the change in Jack's habits. But
Helen's departure had left her suddenly without
support in this affliction. The few days during
which the lad had appeared disposed to return to
his former gentleness and sobriety had unnerved
her for this new strain. She saw her mother&mdash;aged 
and broken by grief and mortification&mdash;now
suffering keenly, and she had nerved herself after
a sleepless night to seek information at the hands
of the man she both despised and feared.</p>

<p>"I came in myself about half past eleven o'clock
last night." This she knew to be true; she had
been looking and listening for Jack, and had stolen
out to the stable at the sound of the opening lot-gate. 
"I supposed he was here before me. I
have not been in his room this morning."</p>

<p>She turned away, but came back and rested her
hand on the edge of the mantel. "He started
from here yesterday, on foot,&mdash;leaving Diana,
strange to say, in the stable,&mdash;intending to catch
the Skipton mail-hack at the cross-road. Did
you see him at Crouch's?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," he answered, standing up. "He
was there. He came in the Skipton mail, and
said he would ride back in the mail from Rassler.
He left word for the hack to pick him up on the

<!-- page 231 -->

road. When I saw him last, he was walking down
the road with Mr. Hilliard."</p>

<p>"With Mr. Hilliard! Oh, thank you, Mr.
Deerford. Then I am sure he is safe." A look
of intense relief crossed her face. She left the
room, and he presently heard her humming a gay
tune&mdash;one of Helen's songs&mdash;as she moved about
the house.</p>

<p>His dinner was served, as it generally was, on
the rare occasions when Jack was absent without
him, in the sitting-room, where he continued to
lounge away the day. Toward sunset, a noise in
the yard drew him to the window, and thence to
the front gallery. Margaret was leading Diana,
saddled and bridled, to the gate. "Can I be of
any service, Miss Ransome?" he asked, descending 
the steps and walking out to meet her.</p>

<p>"No," she said curtly. Then, as if ashamed of
her tone, she added, "I am about riding over to
Mr. Hilliard's to see if Jack is there. It is not
like Roy&mdash;Mr. Hilliard&mdash;to allow mother to
suffer such anxiety. He should have sent us some
word. Of course I know Jack is all right, but
mother"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Deerford, springing forward and
taking the bridle from her. "Why did you not
tell me! Why did I not think of it myself!"
His voice was genuinely self-reproachful. "I
will go myself, at once. And if by any mischance 
I should not find Jack there, I am sure
Hilliard can tell me where he is. Just the time

<!-- page 232 -->

to get my hat and overcoat, and saddle Black
Prince."</p>

<p>He dashed into the house and then into the
stable, and soon reappeared, leading Jack's splendid 
saddle-horse by the bridle. "You never could
have crossed the creek, Miss Margaret," he said,
as he put his foot in the stirrup. "I had to swim
it last night. Tell Mrs. Ransome that I am sure
Jack is safely housed at Hilliard's, and that I will
fetch him home as soon as Black Prince can take
me there and back again."</p>

<p>Margaret had never seen him mount this horse
before without a pang of resentment. He had
appropriated it to his own use almost from the
day of his arrival on Mesquit Creek, Jack yielding 
it to him with enthusiasm. Now she watched
him ride off upon it with a blessing and a heart-felt 
prayer for his safety.</p>

<p>In less than an hour he returned&mdash;alone&mdash;the
horse's glossy coat white with the foam of speed,
and his mane and tail wet from breasting the
creek. Deerford looked slightly concerned. He
did not dismount, but sat in the saddle awaiting
Margaret at the gate. "He is not there," he
said, bending down and speaking in a low voice
as she approached. "Hilliard says he left him
in the Skipton road about dark&mdash;when he himself
turned off homeward. He was waiting for the
Rassler mail. I think it quite likely that he went
on to Skipton in the mail-hack, and that I will
find him there. I am going on at once. You
may look for us some time before nine o'clock."</p>

<!-- page 233 -->

<p>He struck his spurs into Black Prince's side
and galloped off without waiting for an answer.
"Oh," he said, riding back, "I forgot to say that
Hilliard has business which will take him to Rassler 
to-morrow. I told him to look for Jack there,
in case he should not turn up in Skipton."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Deerford," returned Margaret. 
She went back to her mother, outwardly
cheerful, but filled with inward worry. She recalled 
the hints dropped by Jack more than once
lately, of some vague plan for his future. "I am
going to quit this settlement, Margaret," he had
said to her only the day before, "and try my luck
somewhere else. I think anything and any place
would be better than this." She had responded
gayly at the time; now, she remembered, or
seemed to remember, that his eyes had turned to
her wistfully as he spoke, and that he had choked
down something like a sob. She said nothing of
all this to Mrs. Ransome, but it made her own
heart so heavy that by the time Deerford got back
it was well-nigh bursting. Both women ran out
to the gate in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"There is only one horse," Margaret said quietly. 
"It is Black Prince, and Jack is not riding
him. I know the difference in his gait when&mdash;
But don't worry, mother, darling; I am sure"&mdash;The 
words of cheer stuck in her throat. She
looked up at the rider, who had checked his horse
near them; his face was wan and set in the clear
moonlight.</p>

<!-- page 234 -->

<p>"Jack is not in Skipton now, Mrs. Ransome,"
he cried, "but I think I know where our young
gentleman is!" He had dismounted, and was unbuckling 
the saddle-girth. He was silent so long
that Margaret pushed open the gate and came out.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she demanded hoarsely, catching
his arm. "What do you know? What has happened 
to Jack? Tell me. Tell me the truth at
once."</p>

<p>Deerford's laugh was somewhat forced. "There
is no cause for alarm, Miss Ransome," he said.
"At least, the matter does not seem serious to a
rover like myself! You have doubtless heard
Jack talking lately about going away. I confess
I thought it but idle talk, myself, but I&mdash;I hear
that he has really gone. He is, I am sure, waiting 
for me somewhere, intending to join me on
the road. You know that I am going in a few
days"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, that is it! Mother, do you hear
what Mr. Deerford is saying?" She ran back to
Mrs. Ransome and repeated his words.</p>

<p>"You must not blame the boy, Mrs. Ransome,"
he said, coming forward. His voice had not quite
regained its easy assurance; he stammered a little
and turned his face away as he went on. "He
feared you might oppose his going, and so did not
say good-by. But when I&mdash;I join him"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, he will write!" cried Margaret. "Dear
Jack! That is it! I am sure that is it." She
was sobbing hysterically; Mrs. Ransome, now the

<!-- page 235 -->

more composed of the two, led her into the house,
where together they wept thankful tears, and together 
prayed for the absent boy.</p>

<p>Margaret came into the sitting-room after her
mother had dropped asleep. She and Deerford
sat long over the dying embers of the fire. She
had never before been so near to liking him. His
mocking humor was quite subdued. He had a
gentle and at times even an appealing look which
was wholly new to him. He seemed very young,
somehow. Her heart was strangely moved. "If
I could only help him!" she thought, all her soul
yearning over him. She led him, tactfully, to
speak about himself, his inner and outer life, feeling 
for the first time that she was beginning to
know him, and to understand his influence over
Jack.</p>

<p>"I fear that I have not been the best companion
for Jack," he sighed at last, "or for myself,
either! But try and remember, Miss Ransome&mdash;Margaret&mdash;that"&mdash;He 
paused a moment, staring 
steadily into the fire, and went on. "I do not
recollect my father. My mother has never made
a secret of the fact that she loves me more than
she loves her other children. She has always preferred 
me above them, God knows why! for I
have given her little but trouble! I have been
over-indulged, always. I have had more money
to spend than is good for any young man. I have
never been thwarted in anything in my life. And
I&mdash;well, I have not turned out a brilliant success.

<!-- page 236 -->

And it is a charming thing, is it not, to hear a
man who has made ducks and drakes of his life,
and who will probably continue to do so until he,
or somebody else, blows his brains out&mdash;it is
truly charming for him to sit down and whine
like a woman, to a woman!" He jumped up as
he uttered the last words, with a sudden return to
his usual reckless manner, and pushed back his
chair, yawning significantly.</p>

<p>His attitude forbade any further reference to
the subject. Margaret arose at once and put out
her hand. "And you will send him back to us
soon? He will be homesick enough by the time
he meets you, poor boy! He has never been long
away from mother and me. You are quite, quite
sure that he is waiting for you, somewhere?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure. Good-night," Deerford said, with
a solemnity which jarred upon her. He was picking 
up the books and newspapers scattered about
the table, and did not observe her proffered hand.
She opened her lips to speak again, but only a
half-dissatisfied sigh escaped them. He held the
door open for her. "I know that Jack is all
right," he said, smiling brightly at her, as she
passed out.</p>

<p>The weather the next day continued fine. Mrs.
Ransome, almost reassured as to her boy, fretted a
little at the non-appearance of Abner Croft, who
had promised to come and "knock up" some
shelves for her pantry. For Abner had developed
quite a genius for home carpentering, and nothing

<!-- page 237 -->

pleased him so much as to put in a whole day at
Mrs. Ransome's, puttering about under her directions, 
following Margaret the while with the tail
of his eye. "It is outrageous in Abner not to
come. He promised to fix those pantry shelves,
and to make your flower-boxes, Margaret," the
old lady said, frowning over her spectacles and
gazing up the deserted road. "I am afraid Abner
is shiftless."</p>

<p>"No, he is not, mother," cried Margaret. She
turned her face, glowing with the cold, from the
honeysuckle, blown down by Thursday night's
storm, which she was tying to its trellis. "I
cannot let you abuse Abner. He is one of my
friends. But I will see him at church to-morrow
and take him to task for you. Perhaps his mother
is sick."</p>

<p>Deerford remained in his room all day, as he
often did, keeping out of the way of the Saturday
bustle, he laughingly explained.</p>

<p>About nightfall, old Manuel, the Mexican, came
over, bringing a note to Margaret from Hilliard.
Jack had not been in Rassler. Was he at home?
If not, he, Hilliard, would come over at once.
Otherwise, the Reverend David French being his
guest, he would wait until the next day. Could
he accompany her home from church? He wished
particularly to speak with her.</p>

<p>Margaret sent him a line in reply, saying that
Jack had not come home, but they had every
reason to believe him to be out of harm's way,

<!-- page 238 -->

and that he would be with them in a few days.
She, too, had something special to say, but would
reserve everything until their homeward ride the
next afternoon. Would he kindly say to Mr.
French that her mother wished to see him before
he left the neighborhood? "Try and not blame
Jack, Roy," she concluded.</p>

<br/>

<p>The congregation at Peleg Church Sunday morning 
was unwontedly large. It was New Year's
Day, and the great hamper in the wagons, the
coffee-pots, and the kettles and sauce-pans for
warming-over purposes, testified to the universal
decision, that since New Year's Day had fallen on
a Sunday, and since Brother French was "up for a
preach," the Settlement might as well celebrate on
the grounds.</p>

<p>Little David had become a mighty favorite in
the Settlement. The women loved him for his
gentleness, and his (apparent) need of red flannel,
horehound syrup, and mullein strengthener. The
men respected his mingled sternness and indulgent
humanity. His very name tickled the ear of the
Bible-reading community. When Elder Whipple,
in one of his powerful tirades, from Peleg pulpit,
against Old Satan, described himself as a panoplied
Joshua, with a shield and a two-handled sword,
and his esteemed Episcopal brother, then absent
in the flesh, as a little shepherd with sling and
pebble, an irrepressible murmur of enthusiasm
ran over the church, and Red Parsons in the amen

<!-- page 239 -->

corner shouted at the top of his lungs: "Glory to
God for the child of Jesse, an' for his sling, an'
for the content<i>ments</i> ther'of!"</p>

<p>And Bagley responded "Amen."</p>

<p>Several huge brush-heaps were piled here and
there on the slope, and behind the church, ready
to be lighted after the first sermon. The men,
when these had been gathered, stood about in
groups, as usual, discussing neighborhood affairs.</p>

<p>Deerford had come early, riding, not Jack
Ransome's Black Prince, but Margaret's Diana.
He moved from group to group, dropping a word
here and there, restless, alert, and handsome. If
there was any diminution of his power or popularity, 
it did not appear; the younger men especially 
seemed to be more than ever under the
magnetic spell of his presence. There were a
couple of strangers present,&mdash;steady, quiet-looking
men,&mdash;who finally noted the constant recurrence of
Jack Ransome's name in the talk. Their indifferent 
questions drew the whole matter to a head.
By the time Hilliard arrived, in company with the
preacher, nearly everybody on the grounds, men
and women, knew that Jack had disappeared,
leaving no trace of himself anywhere; that he
was last seen in company with Leroy Hilliard late
Thursday afternoon; that he and Hilliard, between 
whom there had been bad blood for some
time, had had an open quarrel; that there was
every reason to suspect foul play on Hilliard's
part; that, finally, if Jack Ransome had been

<!-- page 240 -->

hurt or put out of the way&mdash;no one finished this
sentence. The buzz of excitement was rising beyond 
restraint; Hilliard's friends were protesting
in loud and angry amazement against the implied
suspicion, and freely offering to "lick the sash-lights" 
out of his detractors. At sight of him,
calm, frank-looking, and manly, there was a sudden 
hushed silence. It was already time for the
service to begin. In a few moments everybody
was in place within the church.</p>

<p>A fire roared in the rock chimney; the smaller
children, in a huge semicircle, were roasting
around the hearth like so many rosy crab-apples,
turning first one side and then another to the yellow 
blaze. Every bench was full, and all faces
were turned gravely toward the pulpit. But the
uprisings and downsittings, by this time tolerably
familiar to the people, were performed mechanically, 
lacking a certain fervor which usually accompanied 
them. Mr. French, sensitive to the
least spiritual change, knew that the thoughts of
his apparent listeners were elsewhere. He felt
the swift quiver which passed over them when
Margaret Ransome, a little belated by having
waited for Bud Parsons, came in with her small
escort and sat down near the door. He also felt
the undercurrent which drew toward the place
where Hilliard sat, absorbed and unconscious, with
his arms folded across his breast, and his dark
earnest eyes uplifted to the preacher's own.</p>

<p>David had an overwhelming desire to shorten

<!-- page 241 -->

his sermon, whose text, taken from one of the
Psalms for the day,&mdash;"And he shall be like a tree
planted by the water-side,"&mdash;had come to him as
he rode up to the church and glanced down at
an enormous pecan-tree standing on the edge of
the pool at the foot of the slope. But even while
his mind leaped painfully forward with this intention, 
he caught sight of Margaret Ransome's serene 
face; he looked from her to Hilliard; his
equilibrium was instantly restored, and as he
preached, he compelled the disturbed atmosphere
around him into momentary calm.</p>

<p>When the sermon was concluded, the congregation 
poured out; the brush-fires were lighted, the
coffee-pots were set to boil, coals were raked under
and piled over the skillets, and for a time there
was only a joyous and friendly bustle around the
outspread table-cloths. But the men ate hurriedly
and withdrew to their own side of the church
grounds. Hilliard, who stood somewhat apart with
Red and Green Parsons; the Reverend David,
who, according to his custom, was pacing up and
down the slope, alone, meditating his afternoon
sermon; and Margaret Ransome, surrounded by
a knot of women near one of the bonfires&mdash;these
three were by this time the only adult persons
present who were unaware of the wild conjectures
concerning Jack Ransome's disappearance, and
of the fast-gathering suspicions against Leroy Hilliard.</p>

<p>"Mother is well, thank you, Mrs. Crouch,"

<!-- page 242 -->

Margaret said, in answer to an inquiry, "but she
did not feel quite like driving over this morning."</p>

<p>At this moment Mrs. Kinchley came hurrying
up. She was a kindly but heedless old body, and
at the mere sight of her face puckered into insistent
curiosity, alarm spread through the group. Mrs.
Wyatt laid a hand on her arm, and tried to drag
her away before she could open her mouth, but
she shook herself free. "Margaret Ransome!"
she demanded breathlessly, "ye don't believe
it, do ye? Ye dassent believe it! 'Tain't true!
'Tain't true!"</p>

<p>"What? Believe what, Mrs. Kinchley?" asked
Margaret, trembling a little without knowing why.</p>

<p>"Yo' new log-cabin quilt, Mrs. Kinchley," interposed 
Mrs. Red Parsons volubly, "is the prettiest 
quilt in the"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Believe what, Mrs. Kinchley?" persisted Margaret.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kinchley was too frightened to take advantage 
of any loophole of escape. "Thet Roy
Hilliard hez murdered Jack," she gasped.</p>

<p>Every particle of color forsook poor Margaret's
cheeks. She swayed forward with closed eyes;
half a dozen women sprang to her assistance.
But she stood suddenly erect. "Jack!" she whispered. 
"Hilliard! No," she cried, her voice gaining 
strength and ringing proudly out, "I do not
believe it. Jack is no more dead than I am. And
as to Leroy Hilliard, how can anybody <i>dare</i> to
accuse him of <i>any</i> crime!"</p>

<!-- page 243 -->

<p>"I knowed it! I knowed it, Margaret," said
Lorena Crouch boldly. "I knowed you wouldn't
believe it. Mr. Hilliard is a an-an-gel." She
melted suddenly into tears.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Parsons," said Margaret earnestly, "what
does all this mean? I do not understand. We
are not uneasy about Jack. What is it all about?
Please tell me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons told her in a few words what was
being said concerning Jack's absence. "I don't
know who started the lie, Margaret," she concluded, 
"although I think I could give a pretty
fair guess. But I'd take my Bible-oath that th'
ain't a woman in Crouch's Settle<i>ment</i> as'd believe
Roy Hilliard has teched a hair o' Jack Ransome's
head, not ef a million o' caperin' mule-ear rabbits
swore to it!"</p>

<p>"Believe it!" echoed Margaret scornfully. "If
there is any one on these grounds who wants to
know what I think of such a monstrous story, I
will show him!" She quitted the women and
walked rapidly over to where Hilliard stood. It
was an unheard-of thing for an unmarried woman
to cross the invisible but rigid line of demarcation
between the women's or family side of the churchyard 
and the men's lounging place until after
the second sermon. Everybody, therefore, turned
open-mouthed at this flagrant violation of etiquette. 
There were some men present who expected 
nothing less than a scathing denunciation
of the supposed assassin from the lips of his victim's 

<!-- page 244 -->

sister. These pressed forward to listen;
others held back, apprehensive of they knew not
what; all were only the more bewildered when she
put out her hand and spoke a few cordial but
commonplace words of greeting in a clear unembarrassed 
tone. Only the women understood her
action.</p>

<p>Hilliard, himself surprised at the unwonted demonstration, 
returned her hand-clasp a little confusedly, 
but said with a smile, dropping his voice:
"You will 'shake' Bud Parsons in my favor after
church, I trust, Miss Margaret?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she smiled back. "He accepted my
invitation, indeed, on that condition only. He
has other aspirations&mdash;I think in the direction
of Lorena Crouch."</p>

<p>They stood chatting unreservedly a little longer,
then she recrossed the boundary and walked quietly 
down the slope toward the baptizing-pool. A
touch on her arm startled her. She whirled about
and found herself face to face with Abner Croft.</p>

<p>"Don't run, Miss Margaret," he said humbly.
"I ain't goin' to hurt you. Don't be afeard."</p>

<p>"Why, Abner&mdash;Mr. Croft!" she cried, shocked
no less at his appearance than at his words, "what
do you mean? Why should I be afraid! What
is the matter? Have you been sick?"</p>

<p>His eyes were sunken, his face was hollow and
drawn, the hands, folded in front of him, trembled
painfully, his clothes were disordered, as if hastily
thrown on.</p>

<!-- page 245 -->

<p>"I've been in bed, an' out'n my senses ever
sence&mdash;ever sence last Thursday night." He
spoke in a husky whisper. "I never come to myse'f 
ontell this mornin'. Ole Ma'am Croft says
I've been dee-lirious an' cuttin' up like somebody
plum crazy. God knows how I got home, I
don't!"</p>

<p>He drew her still further apart from curious
ears, and began speaking in low and rapid tones,
without gesture, and standing perfectly still. Mrs.
Green Parsons, who could see Margaret's face
plainly from where she was sitting with her cronies,
saw her shrink back with wild, terrified eyes, and
throw up her hands, as if in shocked protest.</p>

<p>"Abner Croft is plum cracked," she remarked.
"The Lord only knows what odd-come-short of
a tale he's tellin' Margaret Ransome. Sompn
'bout ghosts or sperrits, like he tells the childern,
I reckon. Anyhow, it'll take her mind offn Jack.
She's oneasy about that boy, for all she knows
wher' he is. He ought to be ashamed of hisse'f,
runnin' off like the prodigal son, to feed on husks
an' swine!"</p>

<p>Croft was now urging Margaret to do something
from which she shrank, troubled and pained.
"You say you don't think anything has happened
to him, Miss Margaret. But ef it had! <i>Ef it
has!</i>" he pleaded despairingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Abner, I am sure he is safe. Mr. Deerford 
says he is, and I know he would not deceive
me&mdash;in this. Don't ask me, Mr. Croft; I cannot. 

<!-- page 246 -->

I cannot. It seems almost sacrilegious&mdash;wicked!" 
she exclaimed, trying to turn away from
him. But in spite of her conviction that the poor
creature's mind had been unhinged by fever and
exposure, she felt something like a cold hand
clutching at her heart and arresting its motion.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Miss Margaret," he said gently.
"Just you go up to the church an' set down inside.
That'll be better, anyhow. I'll get Mr. Hilliard.
He loves Jack nigh as much as you do."</p>

<p>"No, no, Abner! I will do it. Give it to me.
It can do no harm. Where did you get this?"
she whispered tremulously, taking something from
him and slipping it under her jacket.</p>

<p>"I come by yo' house, an' I seen it on the sofa,
an' I ast Mrs. Ransome for it. I didn't tell her
what I wanted with it. She humored me, because
she thought jest what you are thinkin' now, Miss
Margaret, that I'm sort o' crazy, an' don't know
what I am doin'. But I swear to God"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Never mind, Abner," interrupted Margaret,
shivering, "tell me exactly what you want me to
do."</p>

<p>A few words sufficed for this; then the two
walked together toward the creek.</p>

<p>"I'll summons ever'body to come," he said solemnly.</p>

<p>The water had fallen a little; an up-thrown line
of debris on the slope showed where the flood had
been, but the great pool was still nearly level with
the steep banks. It had a sullen and angry look,

<!-- page 247 -->

and deserved the reputation&mdash;long accorded it by
common report&mdash;of being the most dangerous
water-hole on Mesquit Creek. The outward curve
of the banks on either side made it a long oval in
shape; the water swirling in at the upper end,
near which the baptizings at ordinary times took
place, bubbled and foamed for a few feet, then fell
suddenly still. The shadows of the leafless trees
overhanging it lay motionless and jet black upon
its smooth mirror-like surface; the great pecan-tree 
which had suggested the text of the morning's
sermon jutted out over the water, twisting its
gnarled roots about the high point of land upon
which it stood; a hackberry partly uprooted had
fallen some distance below, the rough trunk reaching 
out like a rustic bridge about midway of the
pool; one broken fork stood upright near the end;
another, thrust downward into the water, had intercepted 
and held a floating network of dead
leaves, grass, and twigs, that clung to it, and
swayed gently to and fro, wreathed about with
yellowish foam. At the lower neck of the oval
the water scurried out noisily, rippling over unseen 
rocks.</p>

<p>Margaret, guided by Croft, approached the
pool, and stepped upon the projecting point at the
foot of the pecan-tree. She had regained her
composure, though her eyes were downcast, and
her face was deadly pale.</p>

<p>There were others besides Mrs. Red who had
observed with surprise the prolonged talk between

<!-- page 248 -->

the grave-digger and Miss Ransome, and when
these saw her turn with him in the direction of the
creek, they followed almost instinctively; others
again hurried after them, under the impression
that something was happening at the pool. Abner
had no need to summon the congregation. In a
few moments nearly everybody present had crowded
to the creek bank and stood there with necks
craned forward, silently expectant. Deerford was
among the first to press to the front; he looked
around eagerly, but the swift glance showed him
only the girl poised on the gnarled root,&mdash;a slender, 
graceful young figure, with her arms hanging
quietly and her white face turned toward the
western sky. He stepped into the rear circle and
resumed his interrupted conversation with Roper.</p>

<p>The crowd was already beginning to melt and
flow back toward the church, for the hour for
the second sermon was approaching, when those
standing nearest Margaret saw her take from her
bosom and unfurl a long crimson streamer. It
was Jack Ransome's Mexican banda,&mdash;the tasseled 
silk sash which he had worn so constantly
during these last weeks. He had tossed it over
a chair Thursday morning just before he left home.</p>

<p>Many of the spectators wondered what it was.
Some recognized it instantly, and a suppressed
whisper ran from mouth to mouth: "<i>Jack Ransome's 
banda!</i>"</p>

<p>Margaret turned her face appealingly to some
one in the crowd, faltered visibly, then, leaning

<!-- page 249 -->

forward, steadying herself with a hand on the
tree-trunk, she dropped the fluttering piece of silk
on the bosom of the pool.</p>

<p>"What a fantastic, conspicuous thing for Margaret 
Ransome to do!" thought Hilliard, slightly
disgusted. "And how unlike her!" But for the
life of him, he could not help bending over and
gazing with a sort of fascination at the line of
scarlet which had begun to float slowly and softly
down the pool. An unseen eddy whirled it toward
the bank, and swept it out again, dancing and
quivering like a weird thing; it paused, steadied
itself, and drifted on, still more slowly. A ray of
sunlight, striking it as it moved forward stretched
out to its full length, heightened its intense color;
it looked like a long red tongue. As it neared
the fallen hackberry log, it stopped with one end
puffed out&mdash;a tiny bellying sail. Then, as if
seized from below by some invisible hand, it was
drawn slowly downward, inch by inch, until it
disappeared. The onlookers, who had regarded
the whole thing as a bit of child's play, a girl's
caprice, broke into laughing exclamations as the
black water closed over the last shred of fringe.</p>

<p>At the same moment, a man, coatless, bare-headed, 
and in his stocking feet, darted out of the
crowd, leaped upon the fallen hackberry, ran
lightly along it to the upright fork, and stood
silhouetted an instant against the sky; then, raising
his arms high above his head and dipping forward,
he plunged into the pool.</p>

<!-- page 250 -->

<p>The consternation on the bank was extreme;
men and women ran distractedly back and forth,
uttering excited, incoherent cries. "Who is it?"
"He's drowning himself!" "It's Abner Croft!"
"Ab's the best diver in the Settlement!" "He's
plum crazy!" "Watch for him when he comes
up!" "He'll never come up! He's drowned
hisse'f on purpose!"</p>

<p>Several men had already thrown off their coats
and boots and stood ready to grasp the drowning
man as soon as he should rise to the surface. One
or two, Hilliard among them, were in the act of
springing in after him, when he appeared&mdash;almost
in the exact spot where he had gone down. He
held a pocket knife between his teeth. He looked
up, shaking the water out of his shaggy hair and
treading water gently with his feet. He took the
knife from his mouth and called out: "Stand
back ever'body. I'm all right. I know what
I'm doin'. Mr. Hilliard, you go over yander an'
git her out'n the way." Hilliard stared at him
with uncomprehending amazement as he sank again
out of sight.</p>

<p>All commotion ceased. The people stood as if
turned to stone; there was a breathless silence
broken only by the refrain of a hymn which came
floating down from the church, where some mother
was putting her baby to sleep:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">And we'll cross over Jordan,<br/>

Over deep, deep Jordan;<br/>

We will cross over Jordan<br/>

To the city&mdash;of&mdash;Rest!"</p>

</blockquote>

<!-- page 251 -->

<p>A man was making his way through the dense
human ring,&mdash;a lithe, light figure that sped up the
slope, but so stealthily that no one heeded or heard
the fall of his booted foot on the turf. He looked
back several times, turning a livid face over his
shoulder, but without pausing. He drew a pistol
from his hip-pocket as he ran. Some small boys,
heaping brush surreptitiously on a bonfire behind
the church, saw him leap upon a horse,&mdash;Jack
Ransome's fleet filly, Diana,&mdash;and ride furiously
away, digging his spurs into her sides. But they
were too absorbed in their forbidden pastime to
notice whether he took the right or left fork of
the road.</p>

<p>It seemed as if Croft would never rise again!
A handful of bubbles danced on the water, and
little waves riffled across the pool in widening
circles and lashed the banks. The suspense was
painful, the wonder too acute for half-formed conjecture 
to grow into suspicion. At length his
dark head appeared once more, and he began
swimming slowly towards the shore, breathing
hoarsely.</p>

<p>"<i>My God!</i>" Hilliard shouted. Bagley jumped
down from the log where he was standing. "Get
Margaret Ransome out of the way, Amos. For
God's sake, quick, man, quick!"</p>

<p>For the swimmer was pushing something before
him, something formless, ghastly, horrible.</p>

<p>Hilliard himself reached the poor girl as she
tottered forward with a piteous, inarticulate cry.

<!-- page 252 -->

He carried her, fainting, in his arms, to the
church, and gave her into tender, motherly hands.
Then he hurried back to the creek, accompanied
by Mr. French, already in his robes, and prepared
for the afternoon sermon.</p>

<p>They had dragged the swollen and disfigured
corpse from the pool, and laid it upon the trampled
ground. Abner, dripping, and shivering in the
keen north wind, was standing beside it. He had
not uttered a word since he had brought Jack
Ransome's body up from the treacherous depths
of No-Bottom Pool. The men ringed about him
stared in speechless horror, now at him, now at
the awful thing at his feet; the women, drawn
apart, were weeping aloud.</p>

<p>As they drew near, Hilliard took off his coat
and threw it over Abner's shoulders; the minister
hesitated a second, then, removing his gown, knelt
and spread it reverently over the corpse, covering
the poor face with its glassy staring eyes and
hideous open mouth.</p>

<hr/>

<!-- page 253 -->

<div class="center" id="ch14">

<p>XIV</p>

<p class="small">THE LAW</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Abner Croft's</span> teeth were chattering, but less
from cold than from terror; he cast an appealing
glance around, shrinking away from the dead
body and into himself. All the strength and
spirit which had sustained him throughout the
extraordinary scene at the pool seemed to have
gone out of him. He looked exhausted, and pitifully 
weak and old. A dazed expression crossed
his face when he felt the warm coat thrown over
his bent shoulders and drawn gently across his
breast. But the light touch of Hilliard's hand on
his own was like a galvanic shock. He straightened 
himself instantly, lifted his head, and stepped
quietly forward to his former place beside the
drowned lad.</p>

<p>All heads were reverently uncovered.</p>

<p>"Poor Jack! Poor boy!" said Mr. Crouch,
breaking the silence which followed Mr. French's
short but impressive prayer. "He must of got
drownded las' Thursday night tryin' to cross the
creek, a'ter he lef the post-office, an' been washed
down here."</p>

<p>"Poor Jack! To think of him layin' there, an'
his banda findin' him!" remarked Waldrup.</p>

<!-- page 254 -->

<p>It now seemed strange that no one among those
who had seen the sash floating on the pool should
have remembered the superstition, well known to
Crouch's Settlement, that something a drowned
person has worn in life, if cast on the water, will
find his body, though he were lying twenty fathoms
deep below!</p>

<p>"Seemed like that banda knowed he was
drownded"&mdash;began Green Parsons.</p>

<p>"Jack Ransome wa'n't drownded," interrupted
Croft, in a loud clear voice.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Ab?"</p>

<p>"I said so from the first!"</p>

<p>"So did I!"</p>

<p>"For God's sake, man, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"It's murder, that's what it is!"</p>

<p>"Choke him, ef he won't tell!"</p>

<p>"Hang him! Hang him! He's in cahoot with
the devil, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Gentle<i>men!</i>" said Uncle Joe Wyatt, stepping
forward, and taking his place beside Hilliard and
the well-digger, neither of whom had stirred under
this hail of angry menace, "gentle<i>men</i>, I'm the
oldest man here present, I reckin, an' I take it
on myse'f to say ther' shell be no lynchin's an' no
defyin' of the law. Ther' 's been enough o' law-breakin' 
an' too much already in this Settle<i>ment</i>.
I've knowed Jack Ransome ever sence he was
born, an' I've knowed Abner Croft&mdash;well-diggin', 
grave-diggin', house-raisin', an' horse-raisin'&mdash;a 
matter o' twelve year. I take this here case

<!-- page 255 -->

in my own han's. I ain't afeard but what I'll
have backin', ef I need it." He glanced significantly 
at the Parsons twins, Mr. French, and Bagley, 
who had closed up behind Hilliard. "I order
silence in this crowd, ontell Abner Croft has had
a hearin'." He spoke with a quiet dignity which
commanded instant obedience.</p>

<p>"Now, Abner," he concluded, "you tell yo'
tale. Nobody dassent to tech you."</p>

<p>"I'm not afeard," Abner said calmly.</p>

<p>He began his story without preliminary. He
related how he himself had taken refuge in the
church, just before the wind and rain storm on
Thursday night. He confessed his fear lest the
sheeted dead in Peleg churchyard should rise
from the graves into which he had lowered them,
and dance gibbering around him. His voice faltered 
a little when he repeated what he could remember 
of his sermon,&mdash;for which he asked God
and Mr. French here present to forgive him. He
told how Jack Ransome, and a little later another
man, had come into the church and lighted one of
the church candles. He passed over the pack of
cards and the whiskey-flask, remembering Margaret 
Ransome, and slurred over the words which
led to the quarrel. There were but few among
his listeners, however, who could not conjecture
what these words were. "Jack jumped at his
throat," he continued, "an' they clinched, an'
backed, an' knocked over the candle. It was
pretty dark in the church, but the moon was

<!-- page 256 -->

bright as day outside, an' I saw 'em plain enough,
wrastlin' together, an' I heard 'em pantin', over
an' above the roarin' of the creek. Jack was the
heaviest, but <i>he</i> looked like he was made out'n
steel. They kep' on wrastlin' an' pantin' an' not
sayin' a livin' word, an' then they staggered-like
an' rolled out'n the door. I run an' jumped th'oo
the window. I wanted to git out'n the way before
they come back, because I knowed they would be
crazy-mad to think I had heard what they said.
The moon was bright as day, an' I dassent to
move. I scrooched down by the corner of the
church, behind that big stump, an' helt my breath
an' watched 'em. They was gripped close in each
other's arms, an' first down on the ground, an'
then up"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who was the man?" interrupted some one in
the crowd, unable to stand the suspense any longer.</p>

<p>But Abner, absorbed in his own narration, went
on, with his eyes fixed on Mr. Wyatt's face.
"They was both cussin' an' swearin' by this time,
but I thought 'twa'n't no more 'n a tussle betwix'
'em, else I'd ha' jumped in an' tried to part 'em.
But all at once, I saw 'em both go down, an' roll
over an' over. An' only one of 'em ever stood
up any more." A dry sob shook the speaker's
breast. "I saw the one that was up, stoopin' over,
an' then he commenced to say: '<i>Jack! Jack!</i>'
like that, in a whisper. '<i>Jack! Jack!</i>' Jack
never groaned, nor nothin'. But I never dreamt
he was dead! I scrooched still, and listened"&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 257 -->

<p>"Who was the man?" broke in a dozen voices,
hoarse with excitement.</p>

<p>He turned his head slowly. "Didn't I tell
you?" he asked. "I thought I told you. It was
Deerford!"</p>

<p>This time not a word was spoken; men clutched
each other and gasped brokenly, as if awaking from
a dream; a shiver of hysterical excitement ran
through the group of women. "Go on, Abner,"
ordered the minister, lifting his hand in grave
warning to those about him.</p>

<p>"He kept on standin' there&mdash;Deerford, I mean.
My God A'mighty, he kept on standin' over Jack
Ransome. I thought he would stand there ontell
Jedgment Day! After a long time, he went around
the church to where his horse was hitched; it was
Jack Ransome's Black Prince,&mdash;I couldn't see
him, but I knowed him by the way he pawed the
ground. I thought he was goin' to ride off an' leave
Jack layin' there. But he went after his lariat an'
his slicker. He had 'em both over his arm when
he come back. He gathered Jack up an' carried
him down to the creek; he stumbled onct or twict.
I saw Jack's face over his shoulder; he didn't look
like he was dead! I waited, an' waited; an' then I
crope along the slope todes the creek to see what
they was at. Jack was layin' on the ground. The
moon was bright as day. He was pilin' some rocks
in the slicker. I seen him wrop 'em up an' fasten
the slicker to Jack with the lariat. An' then I seen
him straddlin' the hackberry log, hitchin' hisse'f

<!-- page 258 -->

along with Jack in his arms. An' I heard a splash.
I reckin I must of run. But I don't know how I
got away, ner I don't recollect anything more
ontell I come to myself in bed, at home, this mornin'. 
I thought at first I had just been dreamin'.
But when I come clean to my senses, I remembered. 
I jumped up, an' I run ever' step of the
way to Mr. Hilliard's to tell him. But he was
gone to Peleg Church; then I run on to Mrs. Ransome's, 
to tell Miss Margaret, but she was gone to
Peleg, too. I got Jack's banda, because I knowed
it would find him, ef he was layin' in No-Bottom
Hole. <i>Ef</i> he was layin' there! I didn't know
but what he might of come to life, or&mdash;or sompn!
I begged Miss Margaret to throw the banda in,
because 'twouldn't work lessen somebody that he
loved throwed&mdash;it&mdash;in!"</p>

<p>The last words dragged themselves out in a faint
whisper; the speaker's eyes closed, his head fell
forward on his breast, and he sank, unconscious,
to the ground beside Jack Ransome's corpse.</p>

<p>Hilliard lifted him in his arms, as he had lifted
Margaret. As he did so, he displaced the black
robe which covered the dead body. Mr. Crouch
uttered a quick exclamation, dropped to his knees
and rose again, with something in his hand. He
held it up. It was Allan Deerford's little dagger,
and he had drawn it from Jack's heart, where it
had been buried up to the hilt.</p>

<p>The sight of it broke the spell of horror which
had paralyzed the throng during the latter part of

<!-- page 259 -->

Abner's story. A howl of rage shook the air.
"Murderer!" "Scoundrel!" "Where is he?"
"Here!" "No, he is not!" "He was beside me
one minute ago!" "Run him down!" "String
him to the first tree!"</p>

<p>Many were positive that Deerford had been present 
when Croft had begun his narration. Several 
had spoken with him just before the diver
arose the second time to the surface of the pool.
But others began vaguely to recall that they had
seen him edging his way through the crowd, and
walking rapidly up the slope, toward the church.
When it finally became apparent that he had escaped, 
there was a hurried mounting of horses for
the pursuit, and the look on the grim faces of the
men who sat in their saddles, holding a brief consultation 
before starting, boded ill for the assassin.</p>

<p>Hilliard was among these, but he could hardly
steady his nerves sufficiently to bear his part in the
council. His breast was still shaken with the sobs
which he had not tried to repress. He could see,
at the foot of the slope, Amos Bagley and Billy
Crouch busy over the dead lad,&mdash;trying to compose 
the stiffened limbs, closing the staring eyes,
and removing the mud and leaves from the matted
hair. Some women near by had spread a wagon-cover 
on the ground to serve as a winding-sheet.
From the church came the echo of smothered cries,
and Margaret's low, unconscious moans; above
these, Granny Tatum's cracked voice chanting
weirdly:&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 260 -->

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"Death an' jedgment, Lord, are thine.<br/>

Save us Jesus,<br/>

Save us!"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>All this came to his outer senses like the dim
and shadowy sights and sounds of a dream. What
he really saw was a boyish face turned to his, in
the solemn twilight of the forest; what he really
heard was a young voice eagerly asking: "Won't
you shake hands with me once more, Roy?"</p>

<p>"How could I have been so blind? I, who know
Deerford so well! Why did I not carry the lad
with me by force, if need were! Or, why did I
not stay with him! Oh, what is friendship worth,
if it means no more than this! I can never forgive 
myself. But I <i>can</i> help to avenge you, dear,
dear Jack!" These thoughts, which tormented his
brain now, followed him unceasingly for many a
long day after.</p>

<p>He gathered up his bridle at the word of command 
from Roper, and dashed forward. But the
men had not had time to separate into the different 
squads agreed upon for the various directions
of the chase, when a heavy trampling of horses'
feet resounded about them; a loud ringing Halt!
echoed in their ears, and they found themselves
confronted by a body of armed horsemen. The
foremost man was instantly recognized by nearly
all present. It was Morris Pattison, the sheriff
of the county.</p>

<p>With the thought of Deerford uppermost in
their minds, they crowded eagerly about him.

<!-- page 261 -->

"Have you caught him?" "Where is he?"
"Th' ain't a jail in the State strong enough to
keep us offn him, Morris!"</p>

<p>"Who are you talking about?" demanded the
sheriff, frowning. "Caught who?"</p>

<p>"God Almighty! Don't you know?" cried
Roper, forgetting that it had not been an hour
since poor Jack Ransome's body was taken from
its watery grave. He explained hastily. "Deerford 
is riding the fastest horse in the county," he
concluded, "and he has an hour's start. But he
can't ride forever. And we can't stand here forever, 
wasting time, either. Ride up, boys! Ride
up. You'll come along with your posse, Morris?"</p>

<p>"Wait one minute, gentlemen," said Pattison
gravely. He set his teeth together and glanced
over his shoulder at his men, among whom rode
the two quiet-looking strangers who had appeared
at the church that morning. "I have come here
on special business of my own&mdash;for the county.
I have warrants with me to arrest, for wanton
destruction of private property, arson, and murder, 
the following persons here present, to wit:
Allan Deerford, Thomas Roper, Joseph Wyatt,
Junior, Jesse Waldrup, Green Parsons, Jack
Ransome, Samuel Whitehead, Jack Tatum, Jonas
Clayton, and Peter Clayton."</p>

<p>During the reading, the older men and many
of the women came running up and stood listening, 
open-mouthed. The unexpected words fell
like a bombshell. At another time it is likely

<!-- page 262 -->

that the men named in the sheriff's notice&mdash;all
of whom, except Deerford and his victim, were
mounted on fresh horses and armed in one way or
another&mdash;would have attempted flight or resistance. 
But the awful sight they had just witnessed,
the awful story they had just heard, and the terrified 
sense of participation which Deerford's immediate 
followers had in his misdeeds, guiltless
though they were of Ransome's death, paralyzed
them into silent submission.</p>

<p>Green Parsons alone made open protest.
"Look-a-here, Morris Pattison," he said earnestly,
pushing his horse forward to where the sheriff sat,
"I ain't never cut a strand o' bob-wire, ner rode
a foot on a raid. I did give them boys some encourge<i>ment</i> 
in the beginning by goin' to Blackbird 
Gully an' hurrahin' 'em off by night. God
forgive me for it! I'm willin' to pay a find.
I 'in willin' to die, ef die I must. But I swear to
God I'll blow my brains out befo' I'll spend a
night in jail!"</p>

<p>"Don't talk that-a-way, Green!" cried Red,
leaning over from his own horse and throwing his
arms around his twin. "I'm goin' long o' you.
Ef you lay in jail, I'll lay in jail too. Shucks!
What does jail matter, ef yo' conscience is clar,
an' yo' sperrit free! Wa'n't Peter in jail?
Wa'n't Paul in jail?"</p>

<p>He spoke cheerfully, but the tears were streaming 
down his face.</p>

<p>The women, huddled together, were wailing

<!-- page 263 -->

and weeping. The prisoners, with hanging heads,
waited under guard while Pattison made arrangements 
with Hilliard for the immediate pursuit and
capture of Deerford. Then they moved slowly off
in the direction of Rassler, Red Parsons fairly
holding his half-crazed brother upon his horse.</p>

<p>"The jedgment of the Lord has fell on Peleg
Church," moaned Uncle Joe Wyatt, lifting his
trembling hands heavenward. "The jedgment of
the Lord on the congregation of Peleg, on the
elders, an' on the children ther'of!"</p>

<div class="center" id="ch15">

<p>XV</p>

<p class="small">PREPARATION</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> Monday afternoon the mortal part of Jack
Ransome was laid to rest in the wind-swept Peleg
graveyard, beside his father, and in full view of
the spot where he met his tragic death.</p>

<p>Hilliard and French conducted Margaret Ransome 
to her home, where the grief-stricken mother
awaited her. They left her at the gate. "No, do
not come in," she said, "you can do nothing more
for us, now. You must go on at once to Abner.
Thank him for us, and give him our dear love.
But for him our agony would have been greater
even than it now is."</p>

<p>But little more than twenty-four hours had
passed since she had given Hilliard loyal greeting
in the face of Peleg congregation; it seemed impossible 
to associate the wan, wraith-like creature
before him with the vivid blooming girl he had
then looked upon!</p>

<p>Both men remained silent, loath to say the parting 
word. "God bless you, dear," the preacher
said at length, the caressing word slipping unaware 
from his lips.</p>

<p>Her hands, resting on the low fence-pickets,

<!-- page 265 -->

trembled; she bowed her head upon them, and
burst into a passion of tears. "Oh Jack! Jack!"
she sobbed. "You were not wicked, whatever
they may say. And you loved us! Oh, you
loved us!"</p>

<p>"Listen, dear." David's voice was inexpressibly 
tender. "You must not add these painful
thoughts to your natural grief. Jack was not
wicked. His feet were caught in a snare, and he
stumbled&mdash;that was all. Do you think God has
not infinite pity and infinite pardon for all His
creatures, and particularly for all His young creatures?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know," she cried. "But if only
he had not gone out on that last raid! If I had
tried harder to keep him at home! They told me
that the sheriff said"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Margaret,"&mdash;Mr. French had taken her hands
and held them folded close in both his own,&mdash;"listen. 
Jack did not fire a shot that night; he
even tried to dissuade the others. I know. I
talked with them all at Rassler last night. I have
been over to the ranch where the fight took place,
this morning, and seen the ranchmen. Jack was
not with the raiders at the time of the serious
trouble."</p>

<p>Hilliard stared at him with undisguised amazement. 
He must have been almost literally in the
saddle for nearly twenty-four hours. His own
heart throbbed with a remorseful pang. "And I?
I have done nothing, but grieve with her," he

<!-- page 266 -->

thought, almost envious of the cry of heartbroken
rapture which broke from her at David's last
words.</p>

<p>The two men turned their horses into the by-path 
that led in the direction of Abner Croft's
cabin, and rode on, silent for some time, now
side by side, now one following the other when
the path narrowed between encroaching trees.</p>

<p>The story of the night-carousals in Peleg Church
was now known to everybody; the card-playing,
the dicing, the betting, the dram-drinking, and
profane singing and shouting there, these three
or four months past; Deerford's almost diabolical
influence over the reckless gang, his gradual absorption 
of their property, the refusal of all but
young Ransome to attend the last rendezvous,&mdash;all 
this was added to the horror of the lad's final,
lonely struggle for his life on the moonlighted
slope. The knowledge hung like a pall over the
hitherto respectable and self-respecting community,
where the arrests of Sunday had left foreboding
and terror. The falling darkness and the brooding 
stillness of the wood brought it all so vividly
to Hilliard's mind that he started violently and
uttered an exclamation when French spurred his
horse alongside to ask, "Has anything been heard
of Deerford, yet?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and no," he replied. "The filly, Diana,
has been brought in. She was found about twenty-two 
miles below, broken-winded, wandering about
loose. Two or three persons had seen her and her

<!-- page 267 -->

rider in the early part of last night. But we have
as yet no reliable information. I do not myself
think he will be easily captured. He is quick and
clear-headed, and will manage to give his present
pursuers the slip. Of course telegrams with full
description of his personal appearance will be sent
from the nearest telegraph station, and rewards
will be offered. It is only a question of time.
But in my opinion it will take time. And that
brings me to"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wonder that he did not leave at once. It
would have been a very easy matter before the
homicide was discovered," interrupted French.</p>

<p>"I think I know him well enough not to be
surprised at his lingering. Even if he had known
there was a witness of the deed, which of course
he did not suspect, he still might have stayed.
His reckless bravado is extraordinary." A vision
of the midnight scene on his own premises rose in
the speaker's mind. "Besides, he could in any
event count on the theory of death by drowning."</p>

<p>"But the knife?"</p>

<p>"Even there, unless the body should be found
immediately, which was unlikely, he was comparatively 
safe. For Jack had often worn the dagger
in his belt. Poor boy!" He was silent a moment. 
"I was about to say," he went on, "that
I wish to ask your advice with regard to my own
immediate plans. Standing over that boy's dead
body, yesterday, I vowed vengeance on his murderer. 
I then and there determined to follow

<!-- page 268 -->

Deerford to the end of the world, if it should be
necessary, and bring him to justice. This is what
I wish to do. I confess that the man is my own
personal enemy, and this perhaps adds weight to
my feeling in the matter. But I also loved Jack
Ransome. I love his mother and sister as if they
were my own. For such they have ever been to
me since I came a stranger to a strange land. On
the other hand, I foresee a hard fight for those
poor fellows who are doubtless lying to-night in
the jail at Rassler. I know better than any lawyer 
there can possibly know, just how they have
been tempted and misled. I have studied the
whole situation. I know the ranchmen. I think
I may say if I were to appear in the defense of
our boys, I could be of service to them. This will
take weeks, perhaps months, and in the mean time,
Deerford, who has abundant means, will certainly
leave the country."</p>

<p>The minister was silent a long time. Finally
he said, "I cannot make the decision for you, Roy.
I can say, leave the word 'vengeance' alone; but
I believe that feeling to be a mistaken one which
would withhold justice from a criminal, with the
idea that God will bring about his punishment in
some mysterious way of his own. Human laws
are necessary wherever human nature, with all its
varied phases of light and darkness, holds sway.
Otherwise, we should have unimaginable chaos.
Deerford ought and must suffer the just penalty
of his crime. But my heart aches with yours for

<!-- page 269 -->

those poor lads&mdash;for lads the most of them are&mdash;over 
yonder. Public feeling is very strong against
them. I saw that for myself last night. They
will need friends. They will need you! But&mdash;I 
feel incompetent to decide the question. Ask
Margaret Ransome. She can tell you what you
ought to do. And she will tell you."</p>

<p>"You are right, David," Hilliard cried. "I
will see her early to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>A few moments more brought the riders to the
little isolated cabin they sought. It stood in a
sheltered hollow under the lee of a shelving ridge.
Red firelight gleamed through the cracks of the
window-shutter, and at the loud barking of a
yard-dog the door was cautiously opened.</p>

<p>"It is I, Mrs. Croft, Leroy Hilliard. Mr.
French is with me," Hilliard called out reassuringly. 
There was a quick exclamation within.
The door swung wide and the little bent woman
whom he judged to be Abner's mother came hurrying 
out.</p>

<p>" 'Light an' come in, both of ye," she said anxiously, 
"else that child'll be gettin' up."</p>

<p>"How is he, Mrs. Croft?" Hilliard asked,
following her into the house.</p>

<p>Abner himself answered from the bed where he
was lying. "Oh, I'm all right, Mr. Hilliard&mdash;
'specially now!" The look of pleasure on his
gaunt face deepened as the two men approached
and shook hands with him. "It beats reason, yo'
comin' to see me!" he said, "onless"&mdash;his eyes

<!-- page 270 -->

clouded&mdash;"onless you've come to tell me I done
wrong?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, Abner," cried French heartily.
"We came to see how you are, and whether we
can do anything for you. Everybody in the Settlement 
is saying fine things about you, and Miss
Margaret Ransome sends you her own and her
mother's love."</p>

<p>"<i>Me!</i> Ever'body sayin'&mdash;Miss Margaret
sends&mdash;shucks, parson! You know I ain't fitten"&mdash;His 
throat swelled and two great tears
gathered on his eyelashes and rolled slowly down
his cheeks. "Ole Ma'am Croft is a master-hand
with fever," he said, with an artful attempt at a
smile; "but she's give me so much biled-root
stuff that I'm a plum baby."</p>

<p>The fever which had followed the swoon of the
day before was quite gone. It had left him weak,
but he was eager to talk. Hilliard looked apprehensively 
at the mother, who stood at the foot of
the bed. "Let him talk it out," she said, nodding
her head wisely. "It won't hurt him now. An'
it'll keep him from wearyin'."</p>

<p>Abner went over the story as he had already
told it at Peleg, but more in detail. When he
came to the finding of Jack's body, they listened
with breathless interest. "I knowed nobody would
believe me about the&mdash;the killing, onless I could
prove it. I know that most folks thinks I'm sort
o' crazy! And I knowed nobody would dive into
that No-Bottom Hole but me. I was sure-certain 

<!-- page 271 -->

that Jack Ransome's banda would find him,"
he said, "an' it did. It went right down to where
he was a-layin' on his back, with the pile of rocks
tied up in that slicker, holdin' him down. The
banda was floatin'-like jest over him, about a
foot from his face, when I dove the first time. I
didn't see it at first&mdash;nor nothin' else, except a
sort o' yaller light all around&mdash;an' that tree-fork,
standin' up black as tar aside of me. Then I saw
the banda, an' I felt around ontell I teched sompn
soft. I knowed that was <i>him</i>. I tried to cut that
lariat around his waist. But I couldn't. I
thought I'd die whenever I teched him! I quit,
but seem-like he looked at me out'n his pore eyes,
a-beggin' me to try onct mo'. It was awful, Mr.
French. I had to come up to breathe. An' I
didn't nowise intend to go down the second time.
But there was Miss Margaret by the pecan-tree
wher' I put her myse'f. The sight of her give me
strenk to dive ag'in, an' I helt tight a-holt to the
thought of her, whilst I sawed the rope in two,
an' felt him risin' up ag'inst me, like as if he had
come alive, only cold an' clammy."</p>

<p>Mrs. Croft's entrance with a bowl of chicken
broth for the invalid, and two steaming cups of
coffee for her guests, put an end to the gruesome
recital. "Ole Ma'am Croft is a master-hand at
cookin'," he remarked, smiling at her proudly.</p>

<p>"Indeed she is, Abner!" cried French, lifting
his nose from the emptied cup.</p>

<p>After a little more friendly talk, they took their

<!-- page 272 -->

leave. "Mr. French!" Croft called, as they
reached the door. The minister returned to the
bedside.</p>

<p>"You know I've been out'n my senses, parson?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"An' had fever, an' dee-lirium?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But now"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well. I've dreamp a heap o' things, an'
seen a heap o' sights, sence last Thursday. An'
I'm sech a everlastin' fool that I can't edzackly
make out what I've dreamp an' what I haven't."</p>

<p>"Don't let that trouble you, Abner. You are
all right now."</p>

<p>"Maybe, parson, maybe, but I'd like to be
plum sure in my mind whether I dreamp it, or
whether you said"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh," interrupted the parson with sudden comprehension, 
"yes, Abner. Every man, woman,
and child in the Settlement is anxious to take your
hand. And Miss Margaret and her mother send
you their thanks and their dear love."</p>

<p>Abner was silent a moment, then he said solemnly, 
"I reckin I'll tromp many a long mile yet,
an' throw up many spadeful of dirt, an' maybe
find many a spring o' well water. But ef the Lord
wants to take me now, I'm ready to go. An' I
don't ast Him for no better heaven than I'm in
right now!"</p>

<br/>

<p>Hilliard sought Margaret the next morning and
begged advice and counsel of her. "I come to

<!-- page 273 -->

you at the suggestion of David French," he concluded. 
"I wonder that I did not think of it myself, 
as the only thing to do. But I seem to have
been a laggard in many things." He smiled a
little sadly.</p>

<p>She gave him a quick look, then dropped her
eyes. "You&mdash;you wish to defend those men,
after&mdash;after all?" she questioned, with some
wonder in her voice.</p>

<p>"After they have so persistently&mdash;misunderstood 
me, you mean? Oh, yes. That cannot now
affect my feeling in the matter. It was only a
part of the whole strange, mad, sad business"&mdash;he 
faltered, and both fell silent.</p>

<p>"Roy, I wonder if you know"&mdash;she began
wistfully.</p>

<p>He laid his hand on hers. "I know what you
would say, Margaret. Yes, Margaret. I do know
now, that for a few hours I stood accused, under
nearly every man's breath in the Settlement, of
the murder of that dear boy. I know that, in
the blackest hour of my life, when I did not even
dream of the chasm near which I stood, you came
to me before them all, looking confidence into my
face with your sweet eyes, and clasping my branded
hand in yours! God bless you for it, Margaret,
dear, dear Margaret!"</p>

<p>His voice trembled with emotion. She turned
away her head, not daring to trust her face under
his eyes. Her heart beat wildly at this sweet
praise. It was only with an inward loyal cry of
<i>Helen! Helen!</i> that she steadied herself.</p>

<!-- page 274 -->

<p>"Then, Roy," she said, with quiet decision,
"your duty, it seems to me, is quite plain. Leave
the pursuit of&mdash;Deerford"&mdash;she could hardly
frame her lips to utter the name&mdash;"to others.
What will it avail to my mother and me if he is
caught and brought to justice? It will not restore
our darling to us. But these anxious and desolated 
homes around us! Oh, I know but too well
what it means to agonize as the mothers and sisters
of these poor lads are doing! Save those lads,
Roy, if you can. They were led astray, just as
Jack was. I will feel&mdash;we will feel&mdash;that whatever 
you do for them, you will be doing for him."</p>

<p>Here tears came and compelled her to cease
speaking.</p>

<p>"Then I take it upon myself, as a solemn engagement," 
he said, lifting his hand as if under
oath, "and afterward"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let afterward take care of itself," she interrupted 
quickly.</p>

<p>He told her about his last parting with Jack,
and what now seemed like a sad premonition in
the boy's good-by. She in her turn related the
strange conversation she had had with Deerford
in the very room where they now sat, while his
murdered victim lay hidden under the dark waters
of Peleg Pool.</p>

<p>"I know now that there was meaning in the
tone with which he repeated my own words: 'Jack
will be waiting for me somewhere,' " she shuddered. 
"Strange to say, it was the only time I

<!-- page 275 -->

ever liked or trusted him. Had Helen been
here"&mdash;</p>

<p>Hilliard started. Helen had been utterly
crowded out of his mind by the rapidly succeeding
events of the past two days. Now a rush of feeling 
overwhelmed him at the mere mention of her
name. Margaret, with quick intuition, divined
this, and quietly turned the talk in her direction,
speaking of her in words to suit the fondest lover.</p>

<p>"Have you written to her about&mdash;Jack?" he
asked at length, rising to go.</p>

<p>"Not yet. When I do, I shall tell her all you
have been to us, and what you propose to do for
Jack's companions."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Margaret," he said, lifting her
hand to his lips.</p>

<p>He made arrangements in Skipton the same day
for sending his cotton-crop to market, and on the
following Thursday he went over to Rassler to be
present at the preliminary examination of the
fence-cutters. He found, as French had intimated,
public feeling very strong against these men, and
for the first time he learned the particulars of the
affair which had caused their arrest. They had
set out from Blackbird Gully with the avowed
intention of cutting, for the third time, the fences
on a ranch about eleven miles from Crouch's Well.
The ranch was not one of those which had lately
been opened in the county. It was a small one,
long established and of undisputed title. Its
owner, Colbrook, was a respected and well-known

<!-- page 276 -->

citizen. Hearing of the projected raid,&mdash;for the
reckless gang had boasted openly of their design,&mdash;he 
had armed his cowboys and laborers, and
posted them at different points about the place.
It appeared, according to the statement of the
prisoners, that almost at the last moment, when
nearing the ranch, Jack Ransome, for some reason, 
had "backed out;" he and Deerford had had
some hot words, and Jack, as young Joe Wyatt
said, had "sulled," and remained alone at a cross-road 
half a mile from the ranch.</p>

<p>The others, riding forward, had dismounted,
and were in the act of cutting the wire fence,
when they were attacked by Colbrook himself, the
ranch owner, at the head of half a dozen armed
men. In the hurried scrimmage which ensued,
one of Colbrook's men was killed outright, and
another mortally wounded. Deerford galloped off
with his followers, leading them in pure devilment
quite around the dwelling-house and lots, even
stopping to set fire with his own hands to an out-building 
and some ricks of hay. This at least was
the story.</p>

<p>The preliminary examination was conducted in
the presence of a large crowd of townspeople, and
of representative men from both settlements; those
from Colbrook's angry and threatening, the
Crouch's Well faction anxious and dejected. The
court-house several times during the progress of
the examination threatened to become a battleground.</p>

<!-- page 277 -->

<p>Green Parsons was discharged, there being no
evidence whatever against him; the others, with
the exception of Tom Roper and young Joe Wyatt, 
were released on bail. Roper and young Joe
were remanded to jail, there to await trial.</p>

<p>Hilliard immediately offered his services to defend 
each and all of the accused, thereby bringing
upon himself much obloquy.</p>

<p>The cutting of wire fences, when these first invaded 
the county and stretched their feelers about,
regardless of public or private rights, had unquestionably 
been a popular movement. Many of the
best citizens had, like Hilliard himself, taken part
in an open crusade against injustice, thereby bringing 
about not only an abatement of the wrongs
wittingly or unwittingly committed, but forcing
the State legislation on the subject which finally
restored harmony.</p>

<p>But it was not long, in other neighborhoods
besides Crouch's, before wire-cutting became a
cloak for wanton mischief, disorderly gatherings,
and at length for unbridled license.</p>

<p>This section of the country is law-abiding to
an almost astonishing degree. The fence-cutters
soon fell under a ban almost as severe as that
decreed against the poaching fence-builders themselves. 
The Crouch Settlement gang, in particular, 
came in for a really undue share of denunciation. 
Wild tales, many of them exaggerated, were
told of their midnight raids; the unholy roistering
in Peleg Church, unsuspected by the more respectable 

<!-- page 278 -->

inhabitants of the Settlement,&mdash;all this was
known in Rassler. Deerford's charm of manner
and his personal magnetism among men saved him
for a time from reproach; even he had fallen into
disrepute, and his name, coupled with those of his
boon companions, Ransome, Roper, and young Joe
Wyatt, was everywhere branded with shame.</p>

<p>The story of the lawless assault upon Colbrook's
ranch came as a fitting climax. It spread like
wildfire through the county. A meeting was held
in the town of Rassler two days afterward, and
resolutions passed, declaring the good name of the
county at stake, and urging the authorities to take
immediate steps toward the arrest of the perpetrators 
of this and similar crimes.</p>

<p>The prisoners, brought in and lodged in the jail
at Rassler, were regarded with indignant horror;
the killing of young Ransome seemed in some way
a part and parcel of their wrongdoing. The
judge was loudly censured for having admitted
any of them to bail, and Hilliard's offer to defend
them was past belief.</p>

<p>For, according to the well-known axiom that
home folks are the last to recognize either the distinction 
or the dishonor of their own, Hilliard's
course during the past six months&mdash;almost unnoticed 
by his neighborhood&mdash;had provoked much
favorable comment in and around the county-seat.</p>

<p>"I think you are in for it again, Roy," said
Amos Bagley, approaching him after the preliminary 

<!-- page 279 -->

examination, with the buzz of surprise at
Hilliard's action still ringing in his ears.</p>

<p>"I think I am," he replied quietly, "but I also
think I am right."</p>

<p>"Amen!" said Bagley.</p>

<p>The young lawyer realized that a hard task lay
before him; the absolute confidence reposed in
him by his clients and their families was both a
spur and a clog, stimulating him, but adding to
his painful anxiety.</p>

<p>"You could ha' knocked me down with a feather,
when Roy Hilliard come forrard to take them
boys' case after the way he's been treated," observed 
Green Parsons.</p>

<p>"Shucks!" replied Red proudly, "he ain't got
nothin' little about <i>him!</i> An' he'll pull 'em
th'oo."</p>

<p>"It'll pretty near shake his soul-case to pieces
to do it," said Johnny Giles decidedly, "for they
are in a bad row of stumps."</p>

<p>"Well," broke in Billy Crouch, "the United
States Gover'mint ought to pay Roy Hilliard out'n
the Treasure at Washin'ton for undertakin' of the
business. For if anybody can save Crouch's post-office, 
it's him."</p>

<p>"Why, what is the matter with the post-office,
Billy?" demanded Bagley.</p>

<p>"Matter!" exclaimed Billy indignantly. "Th'
ain't a stamp been licked, ner a dinner got, at
Crouch's Well, sence them boys was arrested!"</p>

<br/>

<p>"According to your own showing, Tom," Roper's
older brother Dan, who had come up from W&mdash;&mdash;
to "stand by" him, remarked grimly at the conclusion 
of the private consultation between Hilliard 
and the two young prisoners in the jail, "you
are not <i>worth</i> keeping out of the penitentiary."</p>

<p>"I thought I had found that out, myself," Tom
returned humbly, "but if Roy Hilliard thinks I
am, I'll live up to it the balance of my life, penitentiary 
or no penitentiary; so help me, God."</p>

<p>Young Joe, who had the woe-begone face of a
lost child, said nothing, but clung fast to the hand
Hilliard held out to him at parting.</p>

<p>The case was set for the first week in February.
Hilliard spent the intervening time in preparation.
When he was not shut up in the room he had
taken at the Rassler Hotel, writing briefs, consulting 
authorities, or pacing back and forth mentally
shaping his course, he was riding indefatigably
about the country, looking up testimony, but
chiefly combating personally the bitter prejudice
against his clients. On several of these expeditions 
he was accompanied by the Reverend David
French.</p>

<p>"You are killing yourself, Roy," the latter said
one day, toward the end of January; "you look
haggard and ill. I shall be heartily glad for your
sake, as well as for the others, when it is all over."</p>

<p>"It is my first case!" Hilliard returned, smiling; 
"but it is far more than that, David, as you
know," he added gravely.</p>

<!-- page 281 -->

<p>"Yes, I know. I saw Uncle Joe Wyatt last
night. I believe the old man will die of grief
and mortification if young Joe suffers further
disgrace."</p>

<p>Hilliard sighed wearily and a little dejectedly.</p>

<p>"Nothing has been heard of Deerford, I suppose?" 
French continued.</p>

<p>His companion looked up quickly. "He was in
my mind as you spoke&mdash;naturally enough, I admit. 
I have just learned through a private source
that he has been seen in the vicinity of his home
in Kentucky. By the boldness with which he
showed himself on at least one occasion lately, I
judge he considers himself safe, for the moment,
from pursuit. I know, in fact, how he undervalues
the common intelligence of our people here! As
soon as this trial is over, I shall follow him there&mdash;or 
to the end of the world, as I have already
said."</p>

<p>"You doubtless know that Mrs. Ransome is
very ill?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I have stopped there whenever it has
been possible for me to do so. Poor Margaret,
she is very desolate and alone!"</p>

<p>"If she will but give me the right to shield her,
as far as a mortal man may, from further care!"
said David fervently.</p>

<p>And again Hilliard confessed to himself an unreasonable 
pang!</p>

<p>XVI</p>

<p class="small">THE TRIAL</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> day of the trial dawned clear and bright;
a stout norther blew lustily, whirling the dust
along the country roads, whipping across the public 
square at Rassler, and shrieking noisily around
the stone court-house. Long before sunrise every
available space in the square was crowded with
vehicles and their teams&mdash;buggies, buck-boards,
carts, wagons, hacks; a compact and serried line
of saddle-horses nosed the court-house fence; the
wagon and cotton yards were thronged with cowboys, 
teamsters, and drovers, who had spent the
night there, sleeping on the bare ground, or swapping 
stories around the camp-fires. The stores
were early filled with women and children, but
except for a fitful business in apples and candy,
there was but little trading; the men, lounging in
the wagons, congregated about the town well, or
gathered in corners, were discussing the chances,
pro and con, of the wire-cutters.</p>

<p>Out in Crouch's Settlement, every house, except
Mrs. Ransome's, had been closed and left tenantless 
somewhere between midnight and dawn; their
habitants had parked their wagons and horses on

<!-- page 283 -->

the edge of the town in Rassler, just beyond the
new little Episcopal church; they themselves waited
mute and apparently stolid and unfeeling, around
the closed doors of the court-house, or under the
spiked wall of the ugly squat jail.</p>

<p>When Hilliard entered the court-room, it was
already filled almost to suffocation. Bagley, who
accompanied him, carrying an armful of law
books, noted with some surprise that he shook
hands with Colbrook near the door, and nodded
pleasantly at his old enemy Jellson a little farther
down the aisle. A suppressed murmur ran through
the Settlement people, who sat in a solid phalanx
near the judge's dais, at sight of their champion;
it communicated itself to those near them and for
a second "<i>Hilliard! Hilliard!</i>" rang in loud
whispers through the room. It seemed to Bagley's
keen perception that a certain note of extreme
animosity had dropped out of the cry since he had
last heard it in the same place. He had little
time for such mental comment, however, for the
judge, a dignified, elderly man, had taken his seat;
Walworth, the prosecuting attorney, was hurrying
in. Behind him, headed by the deputy-sheriff,
came the twelve jurors accepted and sworn the
day before. A few moments later the prisoners
filed in, marshaled by Pattison, the sheriff, and
his men. The crowd was so great that scarcely
any one present was aware of their entrance until
they stood before the judge's seat, awkwardly
awaiting further orders. Their appearance sent

<!-- page 284 -->

a thrill through the spectators. There were eight
of them, all told; they looked like mere boys. Not
one of them, in fact, was over twenty-two years
of age; several were under twenty. Roper and
young Joe Wyatt were pale and thin from their
short confinement in the jail; the young faces
were all pitifully solemn and terror-struck. The
loud sobs that burst forth at sight of them were
not all from the Mesquit Creek women, who were
their mothers and sisters and sweethearts; every
woman's heart there ached for them. But with
these sobs were mingled hisses and whispered
menaces.</p>

<p>"Silence in the court!" thundered the judge.
The prisoners were conducted to their seats and
the business of the trial, begun the day before,
proceeded.</p>

<p>Had Hilliard been more experienced, he would
doubtless have used more freely his privilege of
challenging the jurors presented, when the case
was first called. Even the confident Billy Crouch
quaked when he saw among the chosen twelve two
men from the very heart of Colbrook's Settlement.</p>

<p>But the novice showed unquestionable ability in
his management of the case; his handling of the
various witnesses was extremely skillful, albeit
somewhat unusual. The appearance, for the defense, 
of the cowboy supposed to have been mortally 
wounded on the night of the Colbrook raid,
proved a dramatic surprise. He testified that he
had stood elbow to elbow with his comrade who

<!-- page 285 -->

was actually killed. The same man, he declared,
fired both fatal shots; to the best of his knowledge
that man was the leader of the Crouch Settlement
gang. He was a tall, slight man, with light, curly
hair, riding a large black horse. Witness was
positive about the light, curly hair, because the
moonlight fell directly on the man's face; he was
bareheaded; his hat was on the pommel of his
saddle. Witness would know the man again if he
saw him. He was not among the prisoners here
present.</p>

<p>A vigorous cross-examination failed to shake
the wounded cowboy's testimony.</p>

<p>A number of witnesses were immediately brought
forward by the State. The exultation which had
leaped up in the breasts of the Settlement folk
died down again into deep despondency. When
the sitting closed for the day, and the boys trooped
off between the sheriff and his deputy, to the jail,
and the jurors marched out under guard and across
the square to the Rassler Hotel to supper, and the
crowd gradually melted out of the dim court-room,
the general feeling was, that although Hilliard
had done his level best in a manly and straightforward 
way, his case was as good as lost.</p>

<p>About two o'clock the next day the State rested
its case, and the prosecuting attorney began his
speech. Walworth was a large man, of commanding 
presence, great experience, and with a keen,
biting tongue. His speech was a scathing denunciation. 
The youthful prisoners fairly ducked

<!-- page 286 -->

their heads as the lash of sarcasm and invective
curled around their shoulders. The whole story
of their misdeeds was rehearsed, with the coloring
such a man knew how to give it. Not only the
culprits, but the entire Settlement fell under his
castigation; they dropped their eyes and went
white with shame and helpless indignation. The
"youthful and over-confident antagonist" of the
prosecuting attorney came in for his share of ridicule 
and satirical advice; the "champion whose
budding wings had barely sprouted, yet who aspired 
not only to fly, but to carry with him in his
dizzy flight&mdash;not one man like the Genie of the
Arabian Nights, but eight! and these eight weighted
with a burden of crime!"</p>

<p>It was really a masterly discourse of its kind,
backed up by cool and logical argument. The
listeners would have burst into loud and enthusiastic 
applause had they dared.</p>

<p>When Hilliard rose to reply, the contrast was
so striking as to produce a momentary reaction in
his favor. He was as pale, and almost as haggard, 
as Roper himself; the thin line on his left
cheek was scarlet; the dark curls tossed back from
his brow looked unkempt. Many in the audience
were for the first time aware of his youth. There
was a hush of intense expectation as he began to
speak.</p>

<p>With the exception of the fatal shot, or shots,
fired that night at Colbrook's, he frankly admitted
at the outset of his carefully prepared speech

<!-- page 287 -->

nearly everything as charged in the indictments,
and he was then proceeding to lay out his argument, 
when he suddenly found himself floundering; 
a mist swam before his eyes, a cold sweat
broke on his forehead, his tongue was dry, his
sentences became rough and jerky. He glanced
at the stolid faces of the jurors, and from them
to the accused, leaning forward with parted lips,
and staring, blood-shot eyes. Then he turned and
looked out over the vast sea of heads, in reality
seeing no one except Walworth with his large self-satisfied 
smile, and but faintly hearing the sound
of his own words, which continued to drop automatically 
from his lips.</p>

<p>"The jig is up," muttered the older Roper between 
his teeth, ramming his hands in his trousers
pocket, as if by so doing he could force down the
lump in his throat.</p>

<p>Hilliard's roving eyes had finally lighted upon
Granny Tatum, who sat near a window, with her
white old head upon her breast. Beside her, with
the wrinkled old hands held in her own strong
young grasp, stood Margaret Ransome. The girl
looked pale and wan in her mourning garments,
but her face was calm and her eyes were full on
his, expectant, trusting, confident.</p>

<p>He stopped deliberately, gathering himself together 
as if for a spring. Then facing about again,
he opened his lips&mdash;how it happened he never
could explain, but it came rushing forth, that
fervid and passionate appeal to the jury which he

<!-- page 288 -->

had determined not to make! It was old-fashioned, 
this throwing of argument to the winds,
this torrent of fiery, pathetic, tender, homely entreaty&mdash;invocation&mdash;importunity; 
this skillful
play upon those chords which have their roots
under the hearthstones of the beggar and the king
alike; this wide sweep of the arm which infolds
the bruised hearts of all motherhood and all fatherhood! 
It was primitive, it was old-fashioned, it
was obsolete! But it was a genuine and unpremeditated 
cry, and it found an echo in the soul of
every man and woman who heard it.</p>

<p>The judge's voice silenced all exclamation, but
in the hush which followed, "the roof of the co'te-house," 
Red Parsons afterward affirmed, "riz and
fairly stood on eend, and angels, as it were, was
seen ascendin' and descendin'!"</p>

<p>Nobody listened to Walworth's short concluding
summing-up of the case, or to the judge's charge
to the jury, which was delivered in a slightly
husky voice.</p>

<p>The jury managed for form's sake to stay out
about ten minutes.</p>

<p>Hilliard heard the verdict, "Not guilty," as in
a dream, and far away, some thousands of miles
off, as it seemed to him, he saw Uncle Joe Wyatt
lift his trembling arms in thankfulness above his
gray head, and in a radiant cloud pricked with
shooting specks of black, farther away still, Margaret 
Ransome's beautiful face floated, floated;
then a sudden darkness overtook him.</p>

<br/>

<!-- page 289 -->

<p>"Margaret!" he murmured, drifting back to
consciousness. "Where is Margaret?" he demanded 
faintly, opening his eyes into the disturbed 
faces of French and Bagley.</p>

<p>"Miss Ransome has gone," returned the former,
still vigorously chafing his wrists. "She went as
soon as she saw you beginning to revive. She
had left her mother in the care of Mrs. Croft.
Abner came in from Crouch's with her and accompanied 
her back. She is very anxious about her
mother."</p>

<p>The court-room was empty. Hilliard had been
carried into a small office adjoining, whence he
could hear his own name tossed aloft from the
surging crowd in the square. "They would like
to carry you around on their shoulders in a triumphal 
procession," smiled French, assisting him
to his feet. "But as I happen to know that you
have eaten nothing for twenty-four hours, I shall
rush you across to the hotel, instead."</p>

<p>He left him there with strict injunctions to the
motherly landlady to see him fed and looked after,
and walked on, out to the open lot beyond St.
Mark's, where the Crouch Settlement people were
encamped. There, according to Bagley's report,
"he stood the wire-cutters, that <i>was</i>, up in a row
in the middle of Peleg Church congregation, and
gave 'em such a soul-rakin', heart-searchin', spirit-poundin', 
gizzard-reachin' sermon as none of 'em
ever listened to before. They fairly wallowed in
the dust. To tell the truth, I wallowed myself!"</p>

<br/>

<!-- page 290 -->

<p>A fortnight later, Hilliard bade Margaret Ransome 
and her mother good-by. Mrs. Ransome,
feeble and worn and much changed, was at length
able to sit up for an hour or two during the forenoons. 
"I shall go first to Kentucky," he said,
"and afterward to Carolina, to see my family."</p>

<p>"Helen is not in Kentucky," Margaret hastened
to say. "She has gone south with her mother,
who is in failing health. They are visiting some
friends&mdash;she does not mention their names&mdash;on
a plantation in Louisiana. They have been there
some time. I will give you her address."</p>

<p>He glanced at the slip of paper before laying it
in his pocket-book: "<i>Eastwood Plantation, near
St. Denis, Louisiana.</i>"</p>

<p>"You will tell Helen&mdash;everything," she said,
following him out to the gate. "My mother's
dangerous illness has kept me from writing anything 
more than the mere fact that Jack&mdash;has
been taken from us. I thought, I hoped, she
might have heard the story from others, or seen
it in the newspapers. But she has not&mdash;at least
she had not when she wrote. Oh, Roy, you will
be gentle with his memory!"</p>

<p>His answering look was enough! He had said
nothing to her of his intentions with regard to
Deerford. But she had easily divined that his
journey to Kentucky meant Deerford first of all,
then Helen.</p>

<p>"I beg you to be careful," she urged. "As I
have already said, it can give us no comfort to see

<!-- page 291 -->

<i>him</i> brought to punishment, and if in attempting
it you should fall into danger, think what that
would mean to me&mdash;to us!"</p>

<p>"I will be careful," he returned, much moved.</p>

<p>"Then, good-by, Roy. God reward you for
the happiness you have brought to this sorrowing
neighborhood by your defense of those poor lads!
God be with you on your journey. And God
speed you in your wooing, dear Roy!"</p>

<br/>

<p>That night he sat dreaming before the fire
which glowed on his hearth. His packing was
done, his last instructions given to Manuel; and
Abner Croft, who was to drive him over to Skipton 
the next morning, had already gone to bed.
A well-known voice brought him to his feet and
upon the porch. "Is that you, David?" he called
gladly. "I was half expecting you. Come in!
come in!"</p>

<p>Mr. French seated himself, on entering, in the
armchair reserved for him. He seemed thoughtful 
and preoccupied; he had removed his spectacles 
and sat staring absently at his friend with his
beautiful short-sighted eyes.</p>

<p>"I come from Margaret&mdash;Miss Ransome, Roy,"
he said at length, "and you know the hope which
I have been cherishing&mdash;foolishly, perhaps&mdash;these 
many months. Well, that hope is at an
end. The happiness I have so ardently craved
is not for me!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Hilliard, starting forward, his

<!-- page 292 -->

genuine regret and sympathy for his friend mingled 
with an odd sense of relief.</p>

<p>David's lifted hand and averted face checked
further words. "Let us not talk of it&mdash;now,"
he said. But he presently asked, without turning
his head, "Are you sure&mdash;pardon me, Roy&mdash;are 
you sure that you yourself have not a place
in her heart?"</p>

<p>"I! Oh, no. Margaret certainly looks upon
me as a sort of older brother, that is all. And
she knows that I love another woman."</p>

<p>David's pale lips moved; they really framed
the words, "Blind and foolish!" But he remained
silent; and Hilliard ventured to add lightly, "You
too will find some one more yielding. There are
other women."</p>

<p>"There is no other woman for me," David said
sternly; "no woman in all the wide world for me,
now or ever, save Margaret Ransome!"</p>

<p>XVII</p>

<p class="small">EASTWOOD PLANTATION</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> his journey, Hilliard spent one night at a
famous old hotel in the heart of the French quarter 
of New Orleans. He forced himself for the
sake of long-cherished dreams to take outward
note of his quaint surroundings, but though scenes
and sounds returned to him later, with that vividness 
which proves that the mind is a sensitized
plate, receiving and holding impressions without
as much as saying "By your leave" to the master
within, yet at the time he was too eager and excited 
to consciously see and hear. He was early
at the train the next morning, and waited for some
time about the station before the cars were unlocked. 
When he found himself actually moving&mdash;toward 
Helen!&mdash;he sank back in his seat with
a sigh, and compelled his impatient thoughts to
momentary soberness.</p>

<p>He glanced from the window at the sodded
levee guarding the great yellow river and lined
with shipping; at the forest of tapering masts and
wide-mouthed steamer chimneys overtopped here
and there by the ungainly bulk of grain elevators.
As the rushing train sped on, he eyed with interest 

<!-- page 294 -->

which at another time would have been keen
enough, the widespread sugar plantations, where
the faint green of young cane lay like a film over
the rich dark soil, and the plantation-houses, with
their outlying negro cabins, rose-hedged and tree-embowered.</p>

<p>After each preoccupied glance, his eyes came
back involuntarily to the slip of paper he held in
his hand: "<i>Eastwood Plantation, near St.
Denis</i>." He was stealing one day, half a day,
an hour, from self-imposed duty to give to love!
"To see her, to hear her murmur my name but
once, and then&mdash;Kentucky and Deerford!" he
said over and over to himself.</p>

<p>The two hours' run to St. Denis, a small town
on the railroad, was nearly at an end when he felt
a touch on his shoulder. He looked up hastily.
"I beg your pardon," said an elderly man, who
was standing in the aisle and bending over him, "I
beg your pardon, sir, but is your name Hilliard?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, surprised. "My name is
Hilliard, Leroy Hilliard."</p>

<p>"The son of Leroy Hilliard of South Carolina?
Ah, I thought so! One could not easily be mistaken 
in those features. My name is Milgrove.
I knew your father well, Mr. Hilliard."</p>

<p>Hilliard grasped the extended hand. "Sit
down, Mr. Milgrove," he cried with sparkling
eyes. "It is such a pleasure to meet any one who
knew my father."</p>

<p>Milgrove sat down in the opposite seat. He

<!-- page 295 -->

had grown pursy and portly; the hatchet face had
puffed out and the sharp nose was rounded to
a scarlet bulb at the end. Only the keen eyes
remained to suggest in the successful lawyer the
sometime lawyer's clerk. He rubbed his hands
with genuine pleasure; the sight of the young
man brought back a whiff of his own departed
youth. It also awakened his professional curiosity.</p>

<p>"Is your father living?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," replied the younger man, with that deep
regret in his voice which always came with the
memory of his loss. "He was killed in one of
the last battles of the Civil War."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I remember now. General Hilliard
he had become; had he not? Yes, yes. And
your mother?"</p>

<p>Milgrove, remembering the beautiful Lilla Armstead, 
found himself wishing very much to know
something concerning her divorced husband's career. 
"Evidently Leroy Hilliard found another
woman to make him happy, as she found another
man! I wonder if it was a second 'perfect match'
for him also! At any rate, here is the son of Hilliard's 
second marriage," he thought, listening to
the young man's reply.</p>

<p>"My mother died while I was an infant," he
said, seeing in his-mind's eye the short-waisted,
slim, pretty young creature, whose portrait in the
boudoir at home old Martha had encouraged him
to appropriate as his mother's. He could remember 
distinctly, he thought, standing by her knee

<!-- page 296 -->

and looking up into her dark, tender eyes. Mrs.
Blackmore had always assented silently with a
sympathetic caress when he lisped these memories.</p>

<p>"I was brought up by my father's people," he
added.</p>

<p>"Ah." The lawyer's interest in the younger
Hilliard flagged a little. But he looked up courteously 
when the young stranger asked, "Where
did you know my father, Mr. Milgrove, may I
inquire?"</p>

<p>"Why, here!" he said, smiling; "he lived hereabout 
for several years."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" cried Hilliard joyfully. He was
not at all surprised that he should never have
heard this. Mrs. Blackmore had but rarely spoken
to him of those years of his father's life which lay
between her brother's college days and his own
earliest recollection of him. But it seemed to him
a good omen that he should be seeking Helen
Wingate in the neighborhood where his father had
once lived, and where he must have left many
friends. A rush of questions came to his tongue,
and Milgrove, suddenly mindful of deep waters into
which he might plunge unaware, was saved possible 
embarrassment by the stopping of the train at
the St. Denis station.</p>

<p>"Can I serve you in any way, Mr. Hilliard?"
he asked as he was about stepping into the comfortable 
trap which awaited him. "At least you
will allow me to offer you a seat in my carriage?
Your luggage"&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 297 -->

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Milgrove," replied Hilliard,
accepting the invitation frankly. "I have no luggage 
except a small bag. I am here only for the
day. If you will set me down at a livery stable
I will be greatly obliged. I wish to hire a horse.
I have lived so long in the West," he continued
as they spun along the road to the village, "that
I hardly know a horse except under the saddle.
But this is a superb pair."</p>

<p>"You have friends in the neighborhood, then?"
They were approaching a livery stable, whose sign
swung out over the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"Yes. I am going to spend a few hours at
Eastwood plantation. Do you know the place?"</p>

<p>Milgrove brought his horses up with a sudden
jerk. "Eastwood!" he exclaimed sharply . "Oh,
yes." He hastened to calm his voice. "Beautiful 
place, Eastwood. About twenty miles out.
You might have gotten off nearer the place&mdash;at a
flag station. However, I am glad to have met
you, Mr. Hilliard. Call and see me before you
leave, if you have time."</p>

<p>Hilliard shook his hand heartily. "I shall certainly 
see you again if possible," he said. "It is
a rare privilege to meet any man who calls himself
my father's friend."</p>

<p>Milgrove drove away slowly. "Friend? Well,
I did like the poor devil," he muttered, as if apologizing 
to himself for misappropriation of the word.
"But what in the name of the past can a Hilliard
want at Eastwood!"</p>

<!-- page 298 -->

<p>Hilliard, in the mean time, entered the wide
doorway of the stable. A man lurking in an
empty stall near the rear door came suddenly out.</p>

<p>"Hilliard!"</p>

<p>"Roper!"</p>

<p>Dan Roper, for it was he, drew the newcomer
into a shadowy recess, looking around mysteriously
as he did so. "How did you find out?" he asked
in a low tone. "I've got him as tight as a rat in
a trap," he proceeded, too impatient to communicate 
his own news to await an answer. "He couldn't 
get away now, not if he was greased."</p>

<p>"Who? What do you mean, Dan?" Hilliard
demanded, though he surmised at once that Deerford 
was in question.</p>

<p>"In just four days after you pulled Tom through&mdash;if 
it hadn't been for you, Leroy Hilliard, I believe 
that poor boy would be under ground by this
time. He couldn't have stood that jail&mdash;much
less the penitentiary." Roper's dark eyes softened, 
and he gripped his companion's arm affectionately. 
"Inside of four days after that boy
was free, I was in Kentucky, a deputy sheriff,
with a warrant in my coat pocket for that cold-blooded 
villain's arrest. I spotted his hiding-place
near X&mdash;&mdash; at once; or rather his loafing-place,
for, by Jupiter! he was no more hiding than I am;
not as much! He had been pretty careful at first,
it seems; but he had come to think, I reckon, that
there would be no further pursuit of him. Oh,
I heard gay tales about him up there among his

<!-- page 299 -->

neighbors, I can tell you! Yet the dare-devil has
friends there who would die for him. I moved
cautiously, although, never having seen me, he
would hardly have thought twice about Mr. Colston, 
even if he had met that horse-trader. Colston,
you understand, is my name at present. But while
I was kicking my heels around, waiting for requisition 
papers, he left X&mdash;&mdash; and came on here.
Of course you know why he is here?" Roper suggested, 
with the fixed idea that Hilliard's business
in St. Denis was the same as his own.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do know that," Hilliard replied. It
seemed quite in keeping with Deerford's other
reckless doings that he should have followed Helen
Wingate at a time when his neck was in danger
of the halter! "Well," continued Roper, "I followed 
him, of course. He has been here ten days."</p>

<p>"But why have you "&mdash;</p>

<p>"Waited so long? You may well ask! I
haven't enjoyed it, I can assure you. I have been
waiting for the proper papers to be signed and
forwarded. I have them now, safe enough. Meantime, 
I have had him watched, night and day. I
have a spy in his very house. He is making preparations 
to leave this country for Europe, and will
probably try to get away from here to-night. He
has not, so far as I can tell, the slightest suspicion
that the law is at his heels. I have my net so
drawn that he cannot slip through. By God, if
he so much as tries, I will shoot him down like a
dog! He led Tom into disgrace, and has done all

<!-- page 300 -->

he could to ruin his life, and he's got to pay for
it. I didn't know Jack Ransome, poor fellow,
but if there is any justice, Deerford shall swing
for that murder, or rot in the penitentiary! I
mean to take him back to Rassler, dead or alive!
So help me, God!"</p>

<p>"You can count on my help, Roper. To tell
the truth, I did not know he was here. I came
on private business of my own, and intended to
leave for Kentucky to-night, to run him down
myself, if possible. But I am not surprised to
find him hanging around here. Is there any one
here with you from Texas?"</p>

<p>"No; but I have several first-class detectives in
my service, who are keen for the reward offered."</p>

<p>"Have you seen Deerford yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes; twice. Riding about after dark. He
has not stirred abroad in the daytime. Now, here
is what I propose to do "&mdash;</p>

<p>"One moment, Dan." Hilliard looked at his
watch. "I am going&mdash;well, to be frank with
you, I am on my way to see a lady."</p>

<p>"And you want to get that off your mind
first, eh?" laughed Roper. "All right, old fellow. 
I've been there myself&mdash;frequently. Take
your time. We have the day before us in any
event."</p>

<p>"Then I will meet you here, say at three o'clock.
Or I can postpone my visit until to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"No, no. Not the slightest need of that. I
tell you I've got him. Tight as a rat in a trap.

<!-- page 301 -->

One thing, though. Whatever happens, don't
spoil my game."</p>

<p>He led out a horse himself, assuring Hilliard
that it was the best one in the stable, where he
seemed much at home, and saw to the saddling
and bridling.</p>

<p>"Good luck!" he called at parting.</p>

<p>Hilliard made no inquiry concerning the road
to Eastwood plantation, until he was well out of
sight of the stable. He shrank from Roper's possible 
well-meaning but familiar comments. The
countryman who directed him also volunteered
the information that Eastwood was the finest plantation 
in the parish. It was owned, he said, by
a bachelor, who sometimes had gay house-parties
there. At the present moment it was occupied by
some people from "up North, somewhere," who
had rented it for the winter and spring.</p>

<p>He listened, not unwillingly, to the man's rambling 
talk, eager to catch some chance word concerning 
his lady-love, but he was obliged to ride
on none the wiser as to her well-being or her
plans, from this encounter.</p>

<p>The horse he rode was not Hector, as he kept
telling himself, with a longing sweep of his
thoughts to Mesquit Creek; but the livery hack
bore him rapidly enough over the good country
road. He passed several plantations, but for the
last three or four miles of his journey his way lay
through a rather lonely forest, where the giant
oaks and the tall cypresses were draped in Spanish

<!-- page 302 -->

moss which waved mournfully in the wind, and
where pools of dark, still water gleamed under the
tangled underbrush. The broad, fanlike leaves
of the palmetto were mirrored in the pools, and
the trumpets of the scarlet creeper glowed against
the sombre tree-trunks; semi-tropical birds flitted
through the shadows; a purple gallinule sailed
majestically across an open glade, delighting the
horseman's eyes with the flash of his royal wings.</p>

<p>At the end of this bit of virgin wood Hilliard
came unexpectedly upon Eastwood plantation.
The wide wooden gate before which his horse
stopped had been minutely described by the countryman. 
He was in the act of dismounting to
unlatch it, when it swung open, and a bent old
negro stood aside, hat in hand, to let him pass.
He lifted his own hat in courteous greeting.</p>

<p>"God-a-mighty, Marse Roy, is dat you?" cried
the old man, catching at the bridle-rein, and peering 
up in his face. "Wher'&mdash;wher' did you
come from? Don't you recollec' Jerry, Marse
Roy?"</p>

<p>But for his meeting with Milgrove, this salutation 
would have been startling to the newcomer.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Uncle," he said, reaching down
and grasping Jerry's horny palm. "I think you
must be taking me for my father, Leroy Hilliard?"</p>

<p>"Is <i>dat</i> it? You don't sesso, Marse Roy! Has
you r'aly got a growd-up son? I mean, is you

<!-- page 303 -->

Marse Roy's growd-up son? Lord, you is de spit
o' Marse Roy! Well, I <i>dee</i>!"</p>

<p>The old man laughed foolishly, scratching his
bald head. "An' wher' is Marse Roy, hisse'f?
Huccome he ain't come?" he asked, stepping out
and gazing anxiously down the road, as if he expected 
to see his old master. "Huccome you ain't
fotchhim?"</p>

<p>"My father is dead, Uncle. He died many
years ago."</p>

<p>"<i>Daid!</i> Marse Roy <i>daid!</i> Den, Jerry, it's
time you was gwine, too!" He shook his head
mournfully, and tears started into his bleared
eyes.</p>

<p>"Where did you know my father, Jerry?" Hilliard 
asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"Wher'&mdash;wher' did I know Marse Roy? God-a-mighty! 
On dis yer plantation, of co'se. Huccome 
you don't know Marse Roy lived at Eas'wood
fo' de wah? He was de bes' marster! Lord,
Marse Roy has laid de lash on my back mo' times
dan I kin count! Yah! Yah!"</p>

<p>"And where do you live, Uncle Jerry?" Hilliard 
took up his bridle reluctantly; he would
gladly have lingered on, listening to the old man's
talk about his father.</p>

<p>"Who, me? Right here at Eas'wood, Marse
Roy. I'm free now, but I jes' stays on."</p>

<p>"Then I will see you again." He emptied his
pockets of change, which he poured into Jerry's
shaking palms, and rode on.</p>

<!-- page 304 -->

<p>"Neenter tell <i>me</i>," chuckled Jerry, wagging his
old head and chinking the coin. "Dey ain't but
<i>one</i> Marse Roy, an' dat's him. Dat's his looks,
an' dis is his ways."</p>

<br/>

<p>Riding, as another Leroy Hilliard had done,
many many years before him, along the winding
road which led through the heart of the plantation,
with the fields swarming with laborers on either
hand; the Cherokee-rose hedges, glistening green
in the sunlight, skirting the wide lanes; the sugar-house 
looming up idle and picturesque under the
horizon&mdash;noting all these, the impatient lover
came at length, by an abrupt turn, in view of the
Eastwood plantation house. It was a stately mansion; 
the great square central building was surrounded 
with broad verandas upheld by white fluted
columns, and flanked on either side by ample
wings connected with it by airy pillared arcades.
The smooth-shaven lawn in front was shaded by
a few noble oaks, while the circular drive leading
down to the carriage gates was arched over by
thick, low-branched magnolias. Rose gardens,
orange groves, and banana plantations stretched
away from the lawn toward the rear of the house,
and beyond these, the low roofs of the negro
quarter showed above masses of greenery. Hilliard 
reined up his horse, uttering an exclamation
of pure delight. Strangely enough, here, with his
eyes actually dwelling upon the noble fa&ccedil;ade of
the house where he was born, and upon the grassy

<!-- page 305 -->

sweep of lawn where his infant feet had first
learned to walk, he was perplexed and disturbed
by none of those vague memories and intangible
hints which had so often puzzled him at other
times! He rode forward joyously.</p>

<p>"It is just the setting for her," he thought;
"the white palace of a fairy princess!"</p>

<p>He paused again, stricken for the first time by
the realization of what money could do. A picture
rose before him of his own little cabin in the wilderness, 
with its homely surroundings; how could
a woman used to such luxury as this consent to
share his poverty! The all-pervading sense of joy
which possessed him was dulled for a moment.
But only for a moment. "Oh, but I <i>know</i> her!"
he cried confidently under his breath.</p>

<p>He had already dismounted before the low gate
opening upon the lawn. A staid negro-man&mdash;Samp, 
in fact, grown proper and pompous in the
service of the several dynasties which had ruled
at Eastwood&mdash;Samp came forward to meet the
visitor; he carried a pair of shears, and a tray
containing a heap of freshly-cut roses.</p>

<p>"Is Miss Wingate at home?" asked Hilliard.</p>

<p>Samp stared at him with rolling eyeballs, but
recovering himself, received his card with a portentous 
bow. "Yes, sah. Miss Helen is in. Be
please to walk in, sah. You will find the ladies
in the summer-house."</p>

<p>He indicated with a sweep of his hand the large
arbor, draped with honeysuckle and multiflora
roses, to the left of the house.</p>

<!-- page 306 -->

<p>"Shall I"&mdash;the visitor hesitated.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sah. Walk right to the summer-house. 
They ginerally receives mornin' company
in the summer-house. They's expectin' you,
sah."</p>

<p>Hilliard wondered, not knowing that this was
Samp's invariable formula of reception to all
visitors.</p>

<p>"Margaret must have written," he thought,
walking rapidly up the flower-bordered walk.</p>

<p>Samp, looking after him, allowed his surprise
to appear in his well-schooled black face. "Ef
dat ain't Marse Roy Hilliard," he muttered, relapsing 
into the patois of the quarter, " 'Tain't
nobody! What's gwine to happen, I wonder!"</p>

<p>As he approached the summer-house, Hilliard
heard the sound of several voices. He had so
counted upon meeting Helen alone that he felt
discomfited; he slackened his pace, glancing up
at the house as if admiring its majestic proportions, 
but in reality to recover a little from his
disappointment. When he stepped upon the
threshold of the arbor, he saw that there were four
persons within: two women, evidently mother and
daughter,&mdash;and he remarked at a glance that both
were very beautiful,&mdash;were seated on a low bench
facing the entrance; between them sat a young
man, apparently about twenty-two or three years
of age, whose face seemed curiously familiar to
him; the honeysuckle, thrusting its flowering
branches through the green trellis-work, made a

<!-- page 307 -->

frame, as it were, for the three blond heads. In
front of this group, but with his back to the entrance, 
another man was standing.</p>

<p>Hilliard, realizing that these strangers were
unaware of his presence, waited in embarrassed
uncertainty for a second; then his slight movement 
toward retreat attracted the attention of the
older woman. She looked up; a spasm of terror
contracted her fair features; she sprang to her
feet with a piercing shriek. The man standing before 
her whirled about, and Hilliard found himself
face to face with Deerford. He was not wholly
unprepared for such a meeting; although he had
left it out of his calculations as much as possible.
But Deerford's surprise and consternation were
unmistakable. His face became ashen gray; he
shot a quick glance over each shoulder, as if he
were reckoning the chances of a successful dash for
liberty. Then, resuming his wonted air of careless 
indifference, he stepped up to the intruder.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at a wave of his hand, the two bewildered 
young people were half-leading, half-carrying 
the older woman&mdash;now moaning hysterically&mdash;out 
of the arbor and toward the house.</p>

<p>Hilliard looked after them, painfully disturbed.</p>

<p>"What do you want here, may I inquire?"
Deerford's voice, strangely harsh and strained,
recalled him to himself. He turned; the impulse
was strong upon him, as he looked once more in
the fair false face, to spring upon the murderer
and rend him in pieces then and there. But he

<!-- page 308 -->

controlled himself, remembering Roper's injunctions, 
and replied briefly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know of no reason why I should account to
you for my presence here, Mr. Deerford."</p>

<p>"Since you are trespassing on my mother's
premises"&mdash;began Deerford, with a sneer.</p>

<p>Hilliard's hat was off in an instant. "Oh, I
beg your pardon," he said in genuine distress, forgetting 
everything except his own good-breeding.
"I did not know that your mother occupied the
house. I came to see Mrs. Wingate and her
daughter, who, I heard, are visiting here."</p>

<p>A look of relief which did not escape Hilliard's
eye passed over Deerford's face. It was succeeded
by a flush of anger which he promptly controlled.
"Mrs. and Miss Wingate are my mother's guests,"
he said; and he added, his own good-breeding also
rising instinctively to the surface, "Will you walk
into the house? I will have the ladies informed
of your call."</p>

<p>In a brief flash, Hilliard saw his burning cotton
pen and a white hand clutching a dagger; saw a
slim form slipping from group to group in the
grounds of Peleg Church, spreading insidious
poison meant to blast his, Hilliard's, life; saw
Jack Ransome's swollen, disfigured face upturned
to the sunshine by Peleg Pool; saw&mdash;could it be
that it was he, Hilliard, who stood here bandying
compliments with such a man! His half-paralyzed
lips opened; what he might have said he never
himself knew; a window was thrown open. The

<!-- page 309 -->

cry, "<i>Allan! Allan!</i>" rang sharply on the air,
and Deerford&mdash;the hunted look coming back to
his face&mdash;darted past him and ran to the house.</p>

<p>Left alone, Hilliard sat down and dropped his
head upon his hands.</p>

<p>"Roy!"</p>

<p>It was a whisper so soft that another's ears
would not have heard it, but it penetrated his soul
like the still small voice that sounded at Horeb.
He sprang to his feet and clasped her in his arms.
"<i>Helen, my Helen!</i>" was all that he could say
for a time, now gazing rapturously at her lovely
face, now drawing her to his breast in silent
thanksgiving.</p>

<p>"Margaret told you where to find me?" she
asked at length, drawing him to a seat beside her
in the shaded stillness of the old summer-house.
"Tell me of her&mdash;of all."</p>

<p>"Afterward," he said, jealous for the moment
even of Margaret's name in this their first talk.</p>

<p>"Afterward we will speak of all that has happened 
there," he repeated half an hour later.
He saw at once that she remained in ignorance of
the manner of Ransome's death and of Deerford's
flight. "I cannot tell her these terrible things
now," he thought, summing up the case rapidly
in his own mind. "I must leave Roper free to
carry out his own plans. Besides, I will not mar
the glory of this first meeting, which is love's, and
love's only. Forgive me, Margaret, dear sister
Margaret!"</p>

<!-- page 310 -->

<p>Helen was speaking, "It has been very long
in coming," she said, smiling gayly, "this 'early
spring'!"</p>

<p>"Helen! my Helen!&mdash;but how is it that you
are here," he asked, suddenly remembering, "visiting 
his&mdash;Mrs. Deerford?"</p>

<p>"Indeed it is not pleasant for me," she said
gravely. "As I have told you, we have always
lived near the Deerfords. My mother and Mrs.
Deerford have been warm friends for many years,
and although neither has told me in so many
words, I know that they both cherish the hope
that I may one day become Allan's wife. My
mother has never been able to see him as he really
is; and indeed, when he wishes he can be very
winning. Lately, she has begun to realize that
such a marriage is impossible for me. But she
has been nervous and ill for some months, and
when Mrs. Deerford, who formerly owned it,
rented this house from its owner for the winter,
and wrote, begging us to come and spend some
weeks with her, I could not refuse. Mother so
wished it, and Mrs. Deerford expressly stated
that Allan would not be here. I am really fond
of Mabel and of Paul. Allan came ten days ago.
He is leaving, I believe, to-night. He is going
abroad, and perhaps"&mdash;</p>

<p>"He is leaving to-night!" echoed Hilliard inquiringly, 
and with a quick contraction of the
heart.</p>

<p>"Yes. So you will have nothing more to fear

<!-- page 311 -->

from him," she smiled playfully. "But&mdash;but
there is one thing I must tell you, Roy. I do not
know why, but my mother, who is one of the
gentlest and loveliest of women"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of course!" interjected Hilliard, "since she
is your mother."</p>

<p>"She&mdash;she has conceived for some reason a
violent prejudice against you."</p>

<p>"Against me?" cried her lover, startled. "How
can that possibly be? She has never even seen
me."</p>

<p>"I know. But the few times I have ventured
to speak of you since my return from Texas, she
has been so agitated that I have been alarmed.
She has forbidden me to mention your name again,
and refuses to give me her reasons. Indeed, I
now believe that it was in consequence of a reference 
to you in one of my letters, that I was recalled 
home."</p>

<p>"Impossible," said Hilliard again, "unless,"&mdash;he 
paused in his dismayed reflections to say, "unless 
she objects to my poverty. This indeed"&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, no. You do not know her. That would
never weigh an iota with her. But do not be troubled 
about this, Roy. I felt bound to tell you.
But you have only to see her, and she will not
only understand my feelings, but she will love
you, too."</p>

<p>"Flatterer!" Hilliard's alarm subsided; and
he basked again in the sunshine of love and hope.
"And you will keep your promise, whatever

<!-- page 312 -->

comes?" he demanded, slipping upon her finger a
thin circlet of gold, upon which hung, like a tear,
a single great pearl.</p>

<p>"Whatever comes!" she whispered. She arose,
for a shadow darkened the entrance. "Did you
want me, Mabel?" she asked. "Come in. Miss
Deerford, this is Mr. Hilliard."</p>

<p>Hilliard bowed. The young woman looked at
him strangely. Her eyes were red and swollen.
She was very pretty and graceful. "My mother
begs you will come to her for a few moments in
the library, Mr. Hilliard," she said timidly.
"And, Helen, Mrs. Wingate has sent for you.
She is in her room."</p>

<hr/>

<div class="center" id="ch18">

<p>XVIII</p>

<p class="small">MOTHER AND SON</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilliard</span> responded to Mabel Deerford's greeting, 
outwardly courteous, but inwardly deeply
anxious. Could it be possible that Mrs. Deerford
knew of Allan's perilous situation, and was about
to appeal to himself for help? He remembered
her uncontrollable agitation at his sudden appearance 
in the arbor, and he thought, pityingly, that
she must have mistaken him for one of those who
were dogging her son's footsteps. He considered
rapidly the propriety of excusing himself; and
regretted, in spite of the joy of meeting Helen,
that he had not waited, before seeking his betrothed, 
until the business of the arrest was well
over. He felt acutely the pain and awkwardness
of his own presence at Eastwood under the circumstances. 
But even as he debated the question he
was moving mechanically toward the house between 
the two young women.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the wide hall he stopped
and took Helen's hand in both his own. "You
will see me again before I go? For one moment,
at least?"</p>

<p>"Why! Are you going?" she exclaimed. "I

<!-- page 314 -->

hoped you were going to stay until the evening.
I want you to meet my mother. I have heard
nothing, as yet, about Margaret and Mrs. Ransome, 
and poor dear Jack! Must you go? But
I understand. It could not be pleasant for you,
with Allan here."</p>

<p>"It is not that. Or rather, it is not that alone.
I am compelled to return to St. Denis. I have
pressing business there. But to-morrow I shall
be free, and the next day, and the next," he continued, 
gazing into her lovely violet eyes, "until I
start to Carolina to see my people. I shall see you&mdash;wherever 
you may arrange for our meetings.
Not here, unless it be necessary. And when I
go, I shall carry you away with me, never to part
with you again while life lasts!"</p>

<p>Helen blushed, but did not avert her face.
Mabel Deerford had stepped back upon the veranda.</p>

<p>"May I?" he persisted.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she returned. There was a ring of
consent in her voice.</p>

<p>"Then, if I should have to leave the house without 
seeing you again, good-by&mdash;until to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Until to-morrow, Roy." The clasped hands
parted reluctantly. She ran on up the broad stairway. 
Miss Deerford came forward; he followed
her into the library, where she left him, closing
the door behind her.</p>

<p>The room presented almost the same appearance
as when Henry Armstead first brought his bride

<!-- page 315 -->

into it, nearly sixty years earlier. The furniture
which Lilla remembered as a little girl, the claw-footed 
tables and chairs, the great mahogany sofa
with its carved rolling ends and high back, the
footstools with their faded embroidery, even the
low lounge drawn into the bay window, and the
long triple mirror over the mantel&mdash;all these remained, 
sold with the house by Francis Deerford,
who was glad to rid himself of all associations
with Eastwood. Only the old portraits were gone
from the walls; and the modern trifles scattered
about alone suggested the later occupants.</p>

<p>Mrs. Deerford was sitting on the sofa; Allan,
leaning against an angle of the bay window, stood
looking down at her. His face was pale, and distorted 
by some emotion which had come into it
since he had quitted the summer-house.</p>

<p>Lilla Deerford, in her close-fitting black gown,
was still a slender, graceful, and very beautiful
woman. Her abundant blond hair had not darkened 
perceptibly. Certain lines on her forehead
gave it an expression not familiar to it in earlier
days, but her blue eyes were full and lovely, and
her lips were almost as red and smiling as Lilla
Armstead's had been. There was hardly a trace
on her fair countenance of the storm at that moment 
raging within her soul. She raised her eyes
as Hilliard paused, standing before her; a look
which the elder Hilliard would have recognized
came into her face&mdash;the set, hard look which presaged 
a mortal combat.</p>

<!-- page 316 -->

<p>"Pray be seated," she said, with formal politeness.</p>

<p>He acknowledged the invitation with a slight
bend of the head, but remained standing.</p>

<p>"By what right do you call yourself Leroy Hilliard?" 
she demanded abruptly.</p>

<p>Hilliard felt and resented something in her voice
beyond its imperiousness, but he replied quietly,
smiling a little, "By the best possible right,
madam,&mdash;the right of a son to his father's name."</p>

<p>"You are twenty-seven years old?"</p>

<p>"I am," he said, ceasing now to wonder; the
woman's mind was plainly unbalanced.</p>

<p>"You do not remember your mother? No?
Did Leroy Hilliard never speak to you of your
mother?"</p>

<p>"No," he stammered, flushing scarlet. "My
father was killed when I was very young. He"&mdash;</p>

<p>"That is enough."</p>

<p>Something in the manner of the interruption
enraged him; the birth-mark flamed into his cheek,
his eyes flashed. He threw up his head and demanded 
haughtily, "You ask me by what right I
bear my father's name, Mrs. Deerford. May I
ask by what right you put these questions?"</p>

<p>Her folded hands trembled on her lap; he saw
the glitter of diamonds on her slender fingers as
they twisted themselves together. Deerford, who
had not uttered a word, bent over her and said
something in an undertone. Hilliard's senses,
sharpened by rage and suspicion, heard him distinctly:</p>

<!-- page 317 -->

<p>"Do not tell him. Surely you need not
tell him&mdash;after all these years."</p>

<p>"By what right do you question me, madam?"
he repeated, raising his voice and drawing a step
nearer.</p>

<p>"By the best possible right. I am your mother!"</p>

<p>The answer leaped from her pale lips and rang
through the room. Hilliard staggered back, his
senses reeling under the blow. But in a second
he had recovered himself. He looked at her pityingly. 
"If you will permit me, Mrs. Deerford, I
will take my leave. I understand," he continued,
turning to Deerford, who was regarding him curiously. 
"I have learned, since coming to this part
of the country, that my father lived at one time
here, at Eastwood. It is possible that your mother
may have known him. Some unpleasant memory
connected with him doubtless has"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your name is not Hilliard. Leroy Hilliard
was not your father. Your father was Francis
Deerford. Your name is Francis Armstead Deerford. 
And I am your mother."</p>

<p>This time Hilliard tottered and would have
fallen, but for Deerford's arm. He stared at the
rigid form on the sofa with wide, terrified eyes.
"<i>Francis Deerford!</i>" he whispered, "<i>Francis
Deerford!</i>" The name came echoing up from
the depths of his consciousness like a cry from the
grave. Yes, he knew it! He heard himself called
by it, indifferently, sternly, harshly, tenderly.

<!-- page 318 -->

"<i>Aunt Pau-line</i>." His lips just framed the syllables.</p>

<p>Mrs. Deerford threw up her arms wildly.
"Ah," she cried. "He remembers! He remembers!" 
There was an echo of mother-love in her
voice; she started forward as if to spring to his
breast.</p>

<p>He stooped and caught her wrists in his vise-like 
grasp. He would have liked to bend them
backward, as he had once bent Deerford's, until
the slender bones cracked. He forced her to her
seat. "Tell me what you mean&mdash;woman! The
truth! The truth!&mdash;if a Deerford can tell the
truth!"</p>

<p>His face was close to hers, his brown eyes
scorching her blue ones.</p>

<p>The momentary tenderness vanished from her
face. She lifted her head and returned his furious
gaze with eyes as hard and as cold as steel. He
released his grasp and stepped back, breathing
heavily.</p>

<p>"The truth? Yes, I will tell you. Listen,
Francis Deerford. You shall hear all the truth."
She rose to her full height and stood before him
with folded arms, tragically beautiful while she
told the story.</p>

<p>She told it from the very beginning, sparing no
detail of her own misery or of Leroy Hilliard's
brutality. Allan Deerford, who had known nothing 
of this episode in his mother's life, listened,
amazed and horrified, at the torrent of words

<!-- page 319 -->

which poured impassioned from her lips. Hilliard&mdash;the 
discarded and hitherto forgotten Francis
Armstead Deerford&mdash;clenched his hands in impotent 
anger, seeing, not the fair unremembered face
before him, but the noble visage of his adopted
father.</p>

<p>"You may sometimes have wondered, Francis
Armstead Deerford," she cried, "why you carry
on your face the birth-mark which would cause
your detection, were you the wariest murderer that
ever lived. It is not beautiful, that slash across
your cheek! And I will tell you, since I am
telling you other things, how you came by it!"</p>

<p>She related with cruel minuteness the episode of
the mutilated portrait. For the first time, since
she began to speak, Hilliard recoiled, lifting his
arm as if to shield himself. He felt it like a stab
in his own heart, the pitiless ripping of the knife
across that dear pictured face.</p>

<p>But he still kept silence while she sketched
more hurriedly the history of her second marriage
with the man she really loved. Then came the
curious story of the birth of her first child&mdash;the
longed-for heir, the baby boy, the son who now
stood before her an alien, and who was an alien
in his father's house from the day and hour he
was born; the pain and anguish of her own dawning 
knowledge of the fatal, inexplicable likeness;
the shame of it, oh, the shame of it! the bitter
hatred of the man whose loathed features by some
mysterious freak of nature were laid like a curse

<!-- page 320 -->

upon Francis Deerford's child; the suspicions&mdash;vague, 
nameless, horrible&mdash;of her husband which
enveloped her like a pall; his frenzied abhorrence
of the child; into the midst of all this, the coming 
of the second boy&mdash;"you, Allan." She paused
to say this with a glance at him which transformed
the cruel face into a radiant expression of motherhood. 
"You, who have been my heart's love,
and my life's joy and comfort since the moment
I first held you in my arms."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother." Hilliard thrilled, through all
his anguish, to hear the tone. It was so unlike
anything he had ever heard issue from Allan Deerford's 
lips. "Yes, mother," Allan said. He was
hearing all this for the first time. He had learned&mdash;within 
the hour&mdash;only the simple fact that the
man calling himself Leroy Hilliard was his own
brother. "But who knows," he continued, a shade
of bitterness creeping into his voice, "who knows
if the strength of your own and my father's hatred
and despair may not have left its stamp upon me
also, and made me&mdash;what I am!"</p>

<p>"If there is anything in you to deplore, Allan,"
she cried fiercely, "Leroy Hilliard first, and after
him this creature whom I myself brought into the
world, have been the cause of it!"</p>

<p>"I was glad, yes, glad," she concluded passionately, 
addressing her eldest son once more, "when
your father carried you away, though I never
dreamed that I would not see you again. I did
not know that he had taken you to the man whose

<!-- page 321 -->

living image you were then and are still. I do
not know why he did so, unless"&mdash;she paused,
then added recklessly&mdash;"unless he supposed you,
my God! to be that man's son! I did not dream
that you were living until this day. For," a deep
shuddering sob shook her from head to foot, "my
dear husband was killed in a railroad accident on
his homeward journey. I never saw him alive
again. We supposed that you had perished at
the same time, as we ascertained he had never
been to New York with you. His poor mangled
body was brought home to me, and I&mdash;my little
Paul came into the world during the first wretched
hours of my widowhood!"</p>

<p>She sank back, closing her eyes, as if to shut
out Hilliard's marked face. "Allan was right,"
she said after a pause, and in a calmer voice, "I
need not have told you all this. It can only be a
source of misery to you hereafter, as it has ever
been to me. But the sight of you&mdash;the sight of
you! I felt driven to speak." She seemed to be
framing these excuses more for herself than to
him. "Moreover,"&mdash;here she drew herself up
with a motion of pride,&mdash;"with the blood of
Henry Armstead in my veins, and the light of
Francis Deerford's strict integrity shining like a
star before my children's eyes, I could not keep
from you, without shame to myself and to them,
the fact that you are, according to your father's
will, the heir to the bulk of his property." Again
she ceased, but her uplifted eyes spoke on; they

<!-- page 322 -->

said plainly, "Take your belongings, and begone!"</p>

<p>Hilliard continued to stare at her mutely, feeling 
that if he opened his lips howls of rage and
blasphemy would escape them. Finally, mastering 
himself with a powerful effort, he spoke. The
sound of his own voice was terrible in his ears.</p>

<p>"I recognize the truth of your story, Mrs.
Deerford, except so far as it relates to the character 
of the man whose name I have borne since I
can remember. In telling me the story, you have
amply revenged yourself upon me, who am the
innocent cause of your suffering. I trust it has
made you happier to take away from me the father
whose memory I adore&mdash;who was the noblest,
bravest man that ever caressed a forsaken child,
or carried a sword into battle&mdash;to give me in his
place a cold-blooded monster for a father, and a
mother&mdash;oh, my God! my God!" He suddenly
lost all control of himself. His fury and despair
broke forth in a hoarse roar resembling the cry of
a wild animal,&mdash;"a mother, who, according to her
own deliberately chosen words, hated her own helpless 
little child, and cast it from her without a
pang of pity; and a brother"&mdash;he turned ferociously 
on Deerford&mdash;"a brother who is a red-handed 
murderer, and about whom at this moment
the net of justice is drawn!"</p>

<p>"What does he mean, Allan?" Mrs. Deerford
sprang to her feet, alarmed. She looked at Allan,
who made no reply, but turned his eyes questioningly 

<!-- page 323 -->

on Hilliard. "What do you mean?" she
repeated, seizing his arm and shaking it violently.
"Tell me! Tell me!"</p>

<p>"I mean," he said, urged on by a blind rage
which took no account of sex or kinship, and quite
reckless of consequences, "I mean that Allan
Deerford, your son! my brother! is an assassin!
the midnight murderer of his host and chosen
friend. Oh, he will not deny it! Ask him! I
mean that determined men whom he cannot escape&mdash;though 
he has no telltale birth-mark on his
cheek!&mdash;are now near this house, armed with
authority to drag him to the gallows!"</p>

<p>"Is this true? Oh, Allan, Allan, tell me that
it is not true!" the mother shrieked, running from
one of her sons to the other and searching their
faces with her terrified eyes. "Francis, my son&mdash;Leroy 
Hilliard, I beseech you to say that it is not
true."</p>

<p>The coldness, the biting sarcasm, the retrospective 
anger, were all gone. In their stead the entreaty 
of anguished love, the outcry of stricken
motherhood, the fierceness of maternity at bay.
"How dare you! How dare you! Where are
those men? Oh, Leroy, you will send them away,
will you not? You will save my boy? You will!
You will!"</p>

<p>She sank upon the floor and embraced his
knees. "Mother! mother!" said Deerford, choking 
with emotion, trying to raise her in his arms.</p>

<p>"No, no. I will not cease to pray to him, to

<!-- page 324 -->

supplicate him as if he were God himself. Forgive 
me, Leroy, forgive me all the dreadful past.
I mean&mdash;oh, Francis, my son, my son, forgive
me. See how strong you are, strong and masterful 
like&mdash;like <i>him</i>. You must, you shall listen
to me."</p>

<p>Hilliard had tried to release himself from her
clasp. He wished to escape from the rising flood
of anguish which threatened to overwhelm him.
But her long arms held him fast. Finally, a sob,
more like the convulsive gasp of a dying creature
than a human sound, tore her throat, her head fell
backward, her despairing hands relaxed their hold.</p>

<p>He stooped and caught her wrists again with his
trembling fingers. "Go, for God's sake! I will
do what I can. Yes, yes. I promise!"</p>

<p>He dropped unnerved upon a chair and buried
his face in his hands. A rush of hot tears came
to the relief of his overcharged heart.</p>

<p>Deerford lifted his mother in his arms as if
she had been an infant, and carried her from the
room. Hilliard never noticed their absence; and
he looked up with dazed, uncomprehending eyes
when he heard his name spoken once more. "Hilliard!" 
He rose, and the two brothers stood looking 
at each other, long and silently. "I do not
know how it might have been," Allan said at last
slowly, "had I known that you were my brother.
It is too late now. I could not, if I would, justify
myself in your eyes&mdash;that I understand, of course.
But I will at least risk saying that the night you

<!-- page 325 -->

found me setting fire to your cotton I was maddened 
by drink and jealousy. I wish to God you
had killed me then! And I swear to you, standing, 
as I believe I am, on the brink of eternity,
that I did not intend to kill Jack Ransome. He
was choking me like the drunken madman that he
was, and I used the knife to free myself. For a
long time I could not believe that he was dead.
Then the awfulness of it and the thought of the
consequences to myself, and&mdash;believe it or not, as
you like!&mdash;of my mother's grief, swept me on
into doing&mdash;what I did."</p>

<p>"And into laying the burden of your crime, or
the suspicion of it, at least, upon me."</p>

<p>A deep red dyed Allan's pallid face. "Yes,"
he said desperately, "and that! And although I
have done much in my life which calls for remorse
and atonement, that is the blackest crime I have
ever committed! I am not asking for mercy at
your hands; I merely mention the fact." A faint
semblance of his former reckless jauntiness crossed
his speech. "And now, having said so much, Hilliard, 
I desire only to add that you will not, of
course, feel yourself bound by any promise you
have made to my mother&mdash;under the circumstances. 
I understand, by what you have said,
that I am in danger of immediate arrest. I have
counted upon this danger, of course. I know
much that took place after I left Crouch's, and I
quite realize the bitter&mdash;pardon me, I should say
the just prejudice against me there, and therefore

<!-- page 326 -->

what it would mean for me to be taken back there
for any so-called trial&mdash;even"&mdash;he bowed, with
a mocking smile&mdash;"even if Mr. Hilliard himself
should offer to defend me! I am prepared to resist 
capture until my last breath. I am willing to
die, if it comes to that, for&mdash;for what happened
at Peleg Church. But, by God, I will die my
own way!"</p>

<p>"I have promised," Hilliard said sullenly, "and
I will keep my promise. I may not succeed. I
came here, as I told you, on other business. I
did not know that you were here, though I had
pledged my word to search the world over until I
had found you. I met in the town yonder, on my
arrival this morning, the man who has followed
you for weeks, spying upon your every step. He
has planned your arrest. I do not know the plan.
I only know that you are to be taken to-night."</p>

<p>He got up and walked back and forth the length
of the room several times. When he spoke again,
it was in a terse, business-like voice. "Deerford,"
he said&mdash;all recollection of their relationship had
for the moment slipped his mind; he remembered
only the problem confronting him. "Deerford,
I am going back to St. Denis at once to see the
man who holds your life in his hands. You will
give me your word, not for my sake, but your
own, that you will not attempt to leave this house
during my absence."</p>

<p>"Very well." Deerford's curt tone was an
echo of his own.</p>

<!-- page 327 -->

<p>"You will have your horse saddled and be, yourself, 
ready for any emergency. I count upon getting 
back here a little after dark. If all so far
has gone well, I will come in and rap twice upon
the front door. We can then confer as to further
arrangements. I hope to be alone, but it may
fall out otherwise. The whole success or non-success 
of my plan, I confess, hinges upon the influence 
I may have with Dan Roper. I think it
but fair to warn you that he is very bitter against
you. In any event, I will return. A single call
from my hunting-whistle will mean immediate
danger. You must then act as seems best to you,
and&mdash;I will do my utmost to assist your escape.
If escape should be impossible"&mdash;</p>

<p>Deerford returned his meaning look. "You
may rest easy on that score," he said proudly; "I
will never be taken. If all other means fail, I
count on a bullet from&mdash;from&mdash;my brother's
pistol."</p>

<p>"Very well. In the mean time, I repeat that
the least movement on your part looking toward
flight will precipitate matters. There are spies
in your very household. You will await my return."</p>

<p>"I will await your return," said Deerford
calmly.</p>

<p>Hilliard took up his hat and gloves which he
had laid down on entering. "One moment, Hilliard," 
said Deerford; "I may not see you again.
The chances seem to be pretty slim for much more

<!-- page 328 -->

explanation between us in this world! I think
you may not have noticed what my mother said
about my father's will, which devised to his eldest
son the bulk of his property. This will, my
mother has told me, was made before the birth of
the eldest son&mdash;whom I have always supposed to
be myself. I have managed to scatter a good deal
of your inheritance,"&mdash;he laughed shortly,&mdash;"but
the property is still a large one. You will, I
judge, take immediate steps to secure it"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall not touch Mr. Deerford's money,"
Hilliard interrupted curtly.</p>

<p>"My mother will certainly insist"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall never see or communicate with your
mother again. <i>Your</i> mother! For as there is
a God in heaven, though she had brought me into
the world a thousand times, she is not my mother!"</p>

<p>"By God!" cried Deerford, flashing into sudden 
fury, "if I can get out of this house and far
enough away from it to spare the two women I
love the horror of seeing me shot, I would rather
die like a dog than owe my life to you!"</p>

<p>"The two women you love!" There was a
sneer in Hilliard's voice as he repeated the phrase.</p>

<p>"Yes, the two women I love&mdash;my poor mother
and Helen Wingate."</p>

<p>The two faces distorted by passion were close
together; both were terrible&mdash;almost inhuman in
their frenzied emotion. Hilliard's all at once
softened; the image of the little child&mdash;blue-eyed, 

<!-- page 329 -->

golden-haired, rose-wreathed&mdash;danced with
up-flung arms before him! "<i>Ally!</i>" he whispered. 
It was the name by which he used to call
his baby brother.</p>

<br/>

<p>Roper came running out of the stable to meet
him. He reeled in his saddle and dropped like
a lump of lead into the arms which were outstretched 
to receive him. Roper supported him
into the private office of the manager of the livery.
"What in the name of God is the matter with
you, Hilliard?" he demanded when they were
alone, and he had closed and locked the door.
"Have you killed him?"</p>

<p>Hilliard shook his head.</p>

<p>"Has he given us the slip? No? Are you
sick? Then what is it? I found out directly you
left that you had gone to Eastwood plantation."</p>

<p>"I did not know he was there," Hilliard panted.</p>

<p>"I was a d&mdash;d fool not to speak more plainly.
But I took it for granted that you knew where he
was. Besides, I didn't know you were bound
for Eastwood. You asked for Mrs. and Miss
Wingate there. I did not know that you knew
them. But you saw Deerford?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw him. Roper,"&mdash;he lifted his
pinched and drawn face from his breast with an
effort,&mdash;"Roper, Deerford must not be arrested."</p>

<p>"<i>What!</i>" shouted Roper, bounding from his
seat. "Are you crazy, Hilliard? Do you know
what you are saying?"</p>

<!-- page 330 -->

<p>"Deerford must escape. <i>He must escape.</i> I
will tell you why, if you insist. But"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell me nothing," interrupted Roper savagely.
He lifted the chair upon which he had been sitting 
and dashed it violently against the floor.</p>

<p>"If you attempt to arrest him, I will die with
him. For he is prepared to die rather than be
captured."</p>

<p>Roper had hardly heard the threat which fell
from Hilliard's bloodless lips. He was pacing
like a baffled beast about the small office. At the
end of a few moments he came to where Hilliard
sat and laid a hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Roy," he said huskily, "Tom treated you like
a hound-dog, and you paid him for it by dragging
him from the gallows, or out of the penitentiary.
I don't know what you want with Deerford, d&mdash;n
him. I'd rather tear out my heart and burn it
on a rail-pile than to let him go. But if you want
him&mdash;if he was the devil from hell, chained and
ready to be delivered up, by God, I'd knock off
his chains and give him to you! Take him." He
turned his burly body about, and groaned. "God-a-mighty, 
it comes hard! But take him. And I
don't ask any questions."</p>

<p>"I'll ride ahead," he said half an hour later,
when the situation had been fully discussed between 
them. "I'll have to ride ahead and call
off my men. The woods are full of 'em," he
laughed, though with a wry face, "and God knows
what lies I'll tell before I'm through!"</p>

<!-- page 331 -->

<p>"You are a good fellow, Dan!"</p>

<p>"Am I, though! Not much. Don't you make
the mistake of supposing I am letting that double-dyed 
scoundrel of a Deerford slip because I love
my enemies. I don't. But I love my friends,
and there's no goodness in that, that ever I heard
of!"</p>

<p>They walked out into the stable, where Roper
selected a horse for himself and one for Hilliard.
"Now let us get some supper," he suggested.
"We may both need all our strength before this
business is concluded."</p>

<p>He mounted his horse about dusk. "You had
better follow in an hour, or a little less," he said
at parting. "The train passes the flag station at
eight o'clock. I'll have things clear for you, if
possible. Don't waste time when you get there.
Strike across the plantation&mdash;he'll show you the
way&mdash;and catch that train. Get him aboard,
and tell him to put the width of the world between 
himself and Dan Roper as quick as he can.
I don't think there will be any trouble, unless
somebody else is after him, or unless my men suspicion 
that they are losing their game&mdash;and the
reward. But I'm pretty sure I can get 'em out
of the way."</p>

<p>He rode off at a hand gallop. "That girl is in
it, somehow," he muttered. "Ding the women.
They're in everything. This is the way I put it
up. Hilliard has found out that she loves that
villain, Deerford, and to please her, he's running

<!-- page 332 -->

Deerford out of reach of the law. Well, she's a
mighty big fool, and so is Hilliard, and so am I!
But then, so is pretty near everybody else!"</p>

<br/>

<p>It was a quarter past seven o'clock when Hilliard, 
for the second time, walked across the lawn
at Eastwood. It was a cloudy night; the wind
blowing in from the river was soft and warm;
it was heavy with the scent of orange-blossoms.
The windows were lighted on the lower and upper
floors of the house, giving it a gala look. But
everything was very still, without and within.
The negroes over in the quarter were singing a
plantation chorus; he could hear the words distinctly 
as he stepped upon the veranda and rapped
lightly, twice, with his riding-whip on the great
carved door. It opened, and Deerford appeared
on the threshold.</p>

<p>"We have no time to lose," Hilliard said without 
preliminary. "Are you ready?"</p>

<p>"I will be with you in one moment." Deerford
turned; as he did so, Hilliard saw that he held a
pistol in each hand.</p>

<p>"You had best carry your arms, in case of possible 
trouble. But I do not think you will need
them. We are riding to catch the train at Eastwood 
flag station."</p>

<p>Deerford nodded and entered the library.</p>

<p>"Miss Helen have left this note for you, Marse
Roy." Samp's outer and visible man betrayed
no curiosity as he handed an envelope to the young

<!-- page 333 -->

man whose name and features he had been discussing 
the whole afternoon in the servants' quarters.</p>

<p>Hilliard thrust the sealed envelope into his
breast-pocket. He stepped out upon the veranda
and stood waiting in the soft, perfumed darkness.
A confused sound within drew his attention. He
glanced at the library window; the shutters were
wide open, and he saw, framed like a picture
there, Allan Deerford clasped in his mother's
arms; Mabel and Paul bent over them; the lamp-light 
played over the blond heads and illuminated
the anguished faces.</p>

<p>A spasm of anger tore his heart; he half lifted
his whistle to sound the summons agreed upon
with Roper, in case he should decide after all to
let the law have its will. But he dropped the
hand and walked noiselessly down the steps.
When Deerford joined him, he hurried with him
to the stables, giving him brief instructions as
they went.</p>

<p>Deerford threw himself into his saddle, and led
the way down one of those rose-hedged lanes which
had so stirred Hilliard's sense of beauty that morning. 
The Cherokee roses shone on the dense background 
of leaves like white stars; a faint rustle
of wings hinted of birds sheltered within the foliage; 
the clear whistle of a mockingbird now and
then thrilled the night air.</p>

<p>Roper had been as good as his word. Nothing
disturbed their rapid journey. Neither spoke after 
leaving the Eastwood stables until they had

<!-- page 334 -->

cleared, in a swift gallop, more than half the distance 
to the station.</p>

<p>"You will go and see my mother?" Deerford's
question startled Hilliard. He stopped his horse
with a jerk, laying his hand at the same time on
his companion's bridle, and compelling him to
stop also.</p>

<p>"Mr. Deerford," he said sternly, "I wish to
say once for all that after I get you safely on
board of the train we are riding for, all communication 
between your family and myself will cease
forever. As for yourself, I think I need say nothing&mdash;though 
indeed I could say much. But we
are wasting time." He flung Deerford's bridle
from him, and galloped on without awaiting a
reply.</p>

<p>They dismounted in silence at the station.
"We have ten minutes," Hilliard said, coming
back from his brief interview with the solitary
flagman in charge. His heart was beating, and
the blood was buzzing in his ears; he started at
the cracking of a twig under his feet. Deerford
was far the more calm and collected of the two.</p>

<p>"You will sail at the earliest possible moment?"
Hilliard asked, with his ears strained nervously
to catch any unusual sound.</p>

<p>"I have my passage engaged on a steamer which
sails to-morrow for Liverpool direct from New
Orleans. I had already secured it."</p>

<p>"There is the train," said Hilliard in a quick
tone of relief. The great yellow eye of the locomotive 

<!-- page 335 -->

rounding a curve projected its level block
of light along the shining rails.</p>

<p>"Hilliard, this moment, as you have said, ends
our acquaintance forever. If I made any protestations, 
you would not believe me, I know. But
will you"&mdash;Deerford reached out his hand with
a timidity which sat strangely upon him.</p>

<p>Hilliard drew back instinctively; his heart
surged; he opened his lips to say, "I cannot."
But they said, without his own volition, "<i>Ally!
Ally!</i>" And his hand for the first and last time
clasped convulsively the hand of his brother.</p>

<p>The train paused for one second. Deerford
swung himself up the steps of a car and was instantly 
lost to sight in the shadow of the overhanging 
roof. The engine tore off with a shriek.</p>

<p>Hilliard stumbled blindly back across the ditch
to where the two horses were fastened. Two figures 
detached themselves from the gloom and came
forward to meet him.</p>

<p>"Marse Roy!" called old Jerry anxiously.</p>

<p>Roper said nothing for several minutes; he supported 
Hilliard up the bank as if he had been a
woman. "I followed you," he said at length. "I
thought I'd better be somewhere around in case
of trouble. This fool nigger thought I was after
doing you some harm, so <i>he</i> followed me!"</p>

<hr/>

<p>XIX</p>

<p class="small">HELEN</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Helen Wingate left her lover in the hall
at Eastwood, she ran lightly up the stair to her
mother's room, pausing on the landing for a last
look at him, as he followed Mabel into the library.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wingate was a sweet-faced, somewhat
timid woman of about sixty. The tie between her
and her only child was of an unusually strong
character. Helen, quiet, reticent, and self-contained, 
with a tinge of brooding sadness at times
in her voice and eyes, had been, during the whole
of her life, not only her mother's companion, but
the strong arm upon which her mother leaned.
This had given her a sort of sweet imperiousness
to which the older woman submitted with secret
content.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here, madam?" cried the
girl, shaking a white forefinger laughingly as she
came into the room. "Did I not order you to sun
yourself on the lawn for two hours at least?"</p>

<p>"Helen." The tone was so strange, and the
eyes which looked at her were so appealing, that
she stopped short, trembling and wondering.</p>

<p>"What is it, mother? Has anything happened?

<!-- page 337 -->

Are you ill?" she asked, dropping on her knees
beside her mother, and gazing anxiously in her
face.</p>

<p>"Leroy Hilliard is here. I recognized him at
once, as he passed me on the lawn."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that it!" laughed Helen, reassured.
"And now that he is here, mother dear, you must
make the best of him! He has come to ask you
for your dearest treasure, namely my precious self.
And oh, mother darling, I am so happy!&mdash;but I
did not know that you had ever met him?"</p>

<p>"I never have. But I recognized him at once,"
groaned Mrs. Wingate. "Oh, Helen, Helen!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, mother darling? Tell
me. How can you dare to have any trouble without 
letting me share it?" She laid her young
cheek on the thin hands she held and kissed them
tenderly. "Tell me, mother. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Listen then, dear. I tell you because I must.
I thought and hoped you might never need to
know. But&mdash;I have often spoken to you of your
father, Helen, the gallant Confederate officer who
was wounded in battle and brought home to us to
die."</p>

<p>"Yes, oh yes."</p>

<p>"I have described to you the old farmhouse
where we were then living&mdash;and where you were
born, and my lovely young sister. Dear, it is of
that sister, whose name you bear, that I wish to
tell you. She was very young and very beautiful,
and about a year before you were born to be my

<!-- page 338 -->

joy and comfort, she married a Confederate officer,
a brilliant and lovable man much older than herself, 
who was drawn to her, I think, as much by
her open and undisguised affection for himself as
by her beauty and innocence. My own husband
was in the same brigade, and we were all very
happy together, despite the time&mdash;which was one
of doubt, anguish, and despair for the country.
A day came when my sister Helen's husband
dashed in for a few moments to press a good-by
kiss upon her quivering lips. An hour later the
din of battle at close quarters raged around us;
in the midst of it he was brought in mortally
wounded. He died with Helen's name upon his
lips. That night Helen, too, died&mdash;in giving
birth to you, dear. For you are my very own in
love only."</p>

<p>"I do not&mdash;understand&mdash;mother," faltered the
girl piteously.</p>

<p>"You are the daughter of my little sister Helen,
who died in giving you birth." Mrs. Wingate
spoke slowly, raising her voice a little. "And
your father&mdash;the gallant officer who gave his life
for the cause he cherished&mdash;was General Leroy
Hilliard."</p>

<p>"Was&mdash;" Helen knitted her brows, still uncomprehending.</p>

<p>"I took you, dear little wailing orphan," continued 
Mrs. Wingate, relieved by Helen's apparent 
calmness, "and made you my own, giving you
my name. I too was left a widow very soon afterward. 

<!-- page 339 -->

I never dreamed that there could ever be
a reason for you to know! I could not bear"&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Mother! Mother! Mother!</i>" cried Helen,
clinging to her passionately. "Oh, as if you
were not doubly my own, own mother! Oh, why
should you grieve yourself by speaking of it!"</p>

<p>"Do you not see, my darling! This young
man, Leroy Hilliard, is General Hilliard's son by
a former marriage, and your"&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, no, no! Do not say it! Do not say it!"
She shrank back, white with terror, and put out
her hands imploringly. "Do not say it. Mother!
mother!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wingate encircled her with tender arms.
"It is true, darling. I must say it. I did not
know&mdash;doubtless my sister did&mdash;that General
Hilliard had been married before. She had several
letters from his sister, and he intended to take her
to his old home as soon as the war should be at
an end. I, at least, never heard him mention his
son. It was only when in one of your letters from
Texas you mentioned a Leroy Hilliard and spoke
of his father's brilliant record as a soldier, that
I began to suspect. I sent at once to B&mdash;&mdash; in
Carolina, and learned that General Hilliard had
left a son, a bright young fellow named for him,
who had gone to Texas and settled there. Something 
in the tone of your letter determined me to
call you home. But I could not then make up
my mind to tell you that you were not my own"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mother! mother!" the cry came again, broken
by sobs.</p>

<p>"I returned to Kentucky upon my husband's
death, taking you with me, hoping you would
never know," concluded Mrs. Wingate wistfully.
"But now that you do know, you will realize, dear
child, that you have gained a brother"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Never! Never!" Helen shuddered as she
sprang to her feet. "I do not wish him to know.
I wish never to look on his face again. He is
here in the house. I will not see him again! Let
us go away at once, at once!"</p>

<p>She rang the bell violently. When her maid
appeared, she sent an order for the horses to be
harnessed to the carriage without delay and brought
around to a side entrance of the park. She assisted 
feverishly in the necessary packing, leaving
her mother to see Mabel and leave messages for
Mrs. Deerford, who, it appeared, was engaged
in the library and could not be disturbed. Mrs.
Wingate, dimly comprehending the pain of the
young creature, usually so calm and self-reliant,
acquiesced in all her hurried arrangements.</p>

<p>In a very short time the carriage was announced.
Helen had returned for a moment to her own
room&mdash;the same chamber in which Aunt Pauline
had so often wept and prayed over another Leroy
Hilliard&mdash;and had thrown herself on her knees in
an agony of despair. She arose, and stood trying
to recover her self-control. "I cannot see him
again&mdash;ever," she murmured at length. "But I
may at least leave him a line of farewell."</p>

<p>She wrote a few words, constrained and formal,

<!-- page 341 -->

to tell him of her departure, signifying her wish
not to see him again, and dissolving the tie which
for a brief time had held them together. She
signed her name to the note, slipped it into an
envelope, and left it to be delivered to Hilliard.</p>

<p>As she stole down the stair to the carriage, she
heard a voice in the library, which she recognized
as his. It fell upon her heart like a faint and
dying echo of lost happiness.</p>

<p>They drove to the station some miles below
that where a few hours later Deerford caught the
train. There, dismissing the carriage, they waited
for the train. And so it came about that when
Helen entered the car the first person upon whom
her eyes fell was Allan Deerford.</p>

<p>"<i>Helen!</i>" he cried, starting up bewildered.
"How came you here?" She busied herself with
the small luggage, leaving her mother to respond.</p>

<p>"We found ourselves obliged unexpectedly to
start at once for home," Mrs. Wingate said.
"We were unable to see Mrs. Deerford. But we
left explanations and good-bys for her with Mabel
and Paul. They will be coming back to Kentucky
soon, I fancy. And you, Allan? Are you really
off for England?"</p>

<p>"Yes. At last." His tone was absent. He
seated himself opposite to them, but showed no
disposition to talk. He turned his head and stared
out of the window into the opaque darkness weirdly
illuminated by the flying lights of the train; Mrs.
Wingate leaned back among the pillows in her

<!-- page 342 -->

corner and sank at once into wearied slumber.
Helen sat watching the young man's face for a
long time; her own matched it in pallor and listlessness.</p>

<p>Finally she leaned forward. "Allan," she said
in a soft whisper.</p>

<p>He looked up quickly; his gloomy eyes lighted.
"Can I do anything for you, Miss Helen?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wanted to ask if I could do anything for
<i>you?</i> You look ill and troubled."</p>

<p>"No. Nothing that you would be willing to
do," he returned, smiling, but rather wistfully.
"I <i>am</i> ill and troubled. I am leaving my mother,
and&mdash;others, who are dear to me, for a long time,
perhaps forever. I sail to-morrow morning, if
nothing happens to prevent, for England. Ah,
Helen, if you were but going with me!"</p>

<p>He spoke without expectation of a reply, and
turned his face again toward the window.</p>

<p>A shiver passed through her frame. Her eyes
dilated and then closed. She sat quite still, hardly
breathing, grasping the arm of the seat with her
ungloved hand, her mind darting hither and thither
in swift question and halting answer. Presently
the whirling chaos subsided into quiet; she saw,
or thought she saw, clearly. She leaned forward
again.</p>

<p>"<i>Why not?</i>" The whisper was just audible
to him above the monotonous rush of the car over
the rails.</p>

<!-- page 343 -->

<p>He looked at her in bewildered amazement.
"<i>Helen!</i>" He seized both her hands in his,
pressing them until she almost cried out with pain.
"You do not mean it! You cannot mean it!"</p>

<p>"I will go with you to-morrow, if you wish it."</p>

<p>"As my wife?"</p>

<p>"As your wife&mdash;if you wish it." The poor
girl clutched at the thought as the drowning man
at the rope which floats unexpectedly into his
grasp.</p>

<p>"<i>If I wish it!</i> Helen, you are offering me
heaven&mdash;when I was all ready for hell!" The
last words were spoken under his breath. He still
clasped her hands, devouring her beautiful pale
face with hungry eyes. At length he released
them and said, in an altered tone: "You do not
know what you are doing, Helen. I&mdash;I dare not
allow you to take a step which you would regret
afterwards&mdash;bitterly, perhaps. I am not going
to England of my own free will, but because"&mdash;He 
bit his lips; the words were costing him more
than he had foreseen. "I must tell you first why I
am leaving this country forever&mdash;do you understand, 
Helen? <i>forever!</i> Then you can decide."</p>

<p>"Do not tell me," she said quickly. "I do not
wish to know. I will never ask. I, too, have
reasons for going, which I must tell you"&mdash;Her
eyes filled with tears; the rope at which she had
grasped seemed slipping away from her; the waters
closing over her.</p>

<p>"Helen!" He seized her hands again. "It

<!-- page 344 -->

does not matter to me why you are going, so only
you go with me. I promise you, on my part, that
I will never seek to know. And oh, my dear, my
dear, I also promise that I will do my utmost to
make you happy."</p>

<p>She shrank back a little, but left her hands in
his. It was a strange wooing, in open view of
the crowded car, with the trainmen passing back
and forth, and looking curiously at them. The
lights of the city were beginning to gleam in the
distance, blurred by a gently falling rain. Tired-looking 
women were slipping wraps on their sleepy
and fretful children; the smug porter was ostentatiously 
brushing coats and setting out traveling-bags; 
old travelers were still reading their papers
by the light of the swaying lamps, while the less
experienced ones stood nervously in the aisles,
grasping umbrellas and valises. And still the
two forlorn young creatures leaned toward each
other, clasping hands as if for mutual safety.</p>

<br/>

<p>They were married at an early hour the next
morning in the hotel parlor. Mrs. Wingate looked
on, uneasy and astonished, but powerless to interfere. 
The few other witnesses crowding the doors&mdash;guests 
and employees of the hotel&mdash;agreed that
the bride was aristocratic and elegant, but too
pale for beauty. The groom looked nervous, but
then, all grooms look nervous!</p>

<p>The portly clergyman attended Mrs. Wingate
and Mr. and Mrs. Deerford down the stairs to

<!-- page 345 -->

their carriage, and watched them drive off to the
steamer. He was vaguely distressed by an expression 
on the faces of the newly married pair.
"Really," he said whimsically to himself, "I think
a diagnosis of every matrimonial case ought to be
written out and handed to the performing clergyman 
to read before he undertakes it."</p>

<p>One of the witnesses to the marriage, a rather
commonplace-looking man, had also descended the
stairs. He brushed past the musing clergyman
and jumped into a cab; the coachman galloped his
horses after the carriage. The man stood about
the wharf until the passengers were on board the
Brenda, and the great steamship swung slowly
down the yellow stream. Deerford, plainly visible
amid the small knot of voyagers on the vessel's
deck, had bared his head; his yellow curls glistened 
like gold in the morning sunlight; his wife
stood beside him.</p>

<p>"Go and be d&mdash;d to you," the watcher on the
wharf groaned, apostrophizing him, "with your
yellow head, and your white face, and your black
heart, and your bride! But if you keep your neck
out of the halter ten years longer, my name's not
Dan Roper!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen's</span> note, which he read by the light of the
flagman's lantern, while Roper and the old negro,
Jerry, waited for him with the two horses, produced 
in Hilliard's mind only a profound feeling
of thankfulness that she had left Eastwood plantation. 
He put aside the incoherent farewell it
contained as not worth a moment's consideration,
satisfied that Mrs. Wingate, removing her daughter 
precipitately from his reach, had also insisted,
for some reason, upon such a farewell. As if the
width of the world could separate him from Helen!
As if Helen could really wish to put him out of
her life! Unless&mdash;unless she had heard the story
of his birth and his banishment, and had been
repelled by it; unless she had learned, through
Mrs. Deerford, of his denunciation of Allan, and
held him to blame for lack of brotherly feeling;
unless she thought him hard and cruel to his&mdash;mother! 
unless, unless&mdash;</p>

<p>As he galloped on, now ahead of his companions, 
now far behind them, feverishly anxious to
be alone, the rain beating his wan face, his square
jaws set, his black brows drawn together, he

<!-- page 347 -->

might have been the ghost of that Hilliard who
thirty years before had sped over these lonely
roads by night!</p>

<p>"He is hard hit by something outside of Deerford's 
deviltry, poor fellow!" sighed Roper, forgetting 
that he was not alone.</p>

<p>"Dat he is, marster," said Jerry, who rode at
his elbow, leading Deerford's spirited horse. "I
knows de signs. Marse Roy is hamstrenk!"</p>

<p>Jerry was sent on to Eastwood with a single
word, already agreed upon, by way of a message,
to Deerford's mother. Roper accompanied Hilliard 
to St. Denis. The latter had hardly reached
his room in the village hotel when the deputy-sheriff 
appeared in the doorway. He carried a
traveling-bag. "I'm off, Roy," he said. "Good-by."</p>

<p>Hilliard looked at him, surprised.</p>

<p>"I'm going down to the city. Another train
passes here about half past eleven. I want to see
<i>him</i> off." He grinned ruefully. "There might
be trouble yet, you know," he added.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Dan." Hilliard grasped his
hand. "I wish I could tell you how grateful I
am"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Shucks!" said Roper roughly. "Tom ain't
much account. But I think he's worth that! to
say nothing of you!"</p>

<p>The next day Hilliard remained in St. Denis,
although he was possessed by an overpowering
desire to be once more at "home"&mdash;among those

<!-- page 348 -->

dear ones whose love and tenderness were now
dearer to him than ever before. About noon, he
started out with the intention of calling upon Milgrove, 
with the confessed hope of hearing something 
which might cast a new light upon Mrs.
Deerford's monstrous revelation&mdash;or give it the
lie. He found, easily enough, the office he sought.
It was upon one of the long shaded roadways&mdash;for 
they could hardly be called streets&mdash;of the
little old town. The small detached wooden building, 
whose steep roof and broad eaves were green
with moss, looked with one eye, as it were, upon
the old brick court-house in its triangular square;
the other opened into the stately garden of a large
brick mansion. From the doorway one could see
the sluggish Bayou Teche creeping along between
its sloping banks. A sign above the door read,
"Ralston &amp; Milgrove." There seemed to be no
one within, although the door stood open, and
the wind blowing up from the bayou fluttered
the leaves of a law-book open on a table. Hilliard
hailed a negro lad at work in the garden. "Is
Mr. Milgrove in?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Mist' Milgrove has jest druv home, sah," the
lad replied, "but de jedge is in de library."</p>

<p>Hilliard turned to go. A window was opened
in the dwelling-house, and an elderly gentleman
stepped out upon the veranda. "Did you wish to
see me?" he asked, advancing, newspaper in hand.
"Oh, Mr. Hilliard! I heard of your arrival yesterday 
from my partner, Milgrove. How do you do?

<!-- page 349 -->

I should have recognized you anywhere. I knew
your father long before you were born. Come in.
Come in."</p>

<p>Hilliard winced, but he followed Judge Ralston
into his library and sat down. Ralston, now an
old man, was still hale and hearty. The sight of
Hilliard brought to him, as it had to Milgrove,
a swarm of pleasant recollections. He chatted on
exuberantly, not observing his visitor's embarrassment; 
recalling what he was pleased to characterize 
the "good old times," when Leroy Hilliard
was one of his own friends and neighbors. Suddenly 
he paused, embarrassed in his turn. "By
Jove," he reflected. "I certainly am falling into
my dotage. I had forgotten that it was I who
brought the suit for the divorce! The lad evidently 
knows it, too."</p>

<p>But Hilliard had merely been nerving himself
to speak. Something in the old man's tone or
manner, or both, inspired confidence. Begging in
advance an assurance of secrecy, he laid before
the astonished lawyer the extraordinary facts of
his life, as he had received them from Mrs. Deerford 
the day before. He heard in return the
history of her earlier years before and during her
first marriage, and afterward, up to the time she
had left Eastwood plantation with her second
husband; all this in a much more connected and
coherent manner than the excited and unhappy
woman herself had been able to give it. Any lingering 
hope that the part of it which related to

<!-- page 350 -->

himself might be a dream of her imagination was
dispelled. Ralston remembered the rejoicings at
Eastwood over the heir's birth; he himself had
drawn up Francis Deerford's will. He had remarked, 
perhaps before the mother noticed it, the
curious likeness the boy bore to Leroy Hilliard;
he had observed the scarlet mark upon the infant's
cheek. He confessed that he had also observed
Francis Deerford's increasing dislike of his first-born, 
and the wife's growing anxiety. All these
things had long ago faded from his memory, and
were revived only by the young man's story.</p>

<p>"Lilla Armstead was a very strange girl," he
concluded. "I knew her from her infancy. She
was self-willed, and she had a fierce, overbearing
temper. Perhaps Henry Armstead&mdash;why, God
bless my soul, boy, he was your grandfather, and
the best soul that ever lived!&mdash;perhaps he was
responsible for much of her waywardness, for he
spoiled her systematically. She and Hilliard
hated each other like young tiger-cats. I saw
that soon enough, but she certainly adored Deerford. 
I never could understand how you came
by your looks! But I now remember hinting to
Deerford that he ought to leave this State. He
said nothing to me, but I could see what was passing 
in his mind. So. It has turned out strangely
enough. I took it for granted, when Milgrove
mentioned your arrival,&mdash;as he did,&mdash;that your
fa&mdash;that Hilliard had married again, and that
you were the son of that marriage. But how came
Hilliard to have charge of you?"</p>

<!-- page 351 -->

<p>"I do not know. Mrs. Deerford herself does
not know," Hilliard replied, sick at heart. "I
may learn something of my earlier life when I get
back to Carolina. I remember nothing."</p>

<p>"And the property? Deerford's, I mean? The
greater part of it was to come to you unconditionally, 
in the event of his death, upon your coming
of age."</p>

<p>"I shall not touch it, Judge Ralston; not a
penny of it!"</p>

<p>"Tut-tut! Don't be quixotic, boy. It would
serve Lilla right if she had to give up every cent
she has. Unfeeling mother! Well, well. They
tell me, by the way, that there is another son, who
is a sort of a scamp. I believe he is at Eastwood
now!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I met him yesterday. In fact, strangely
enough, I knew him in Texas, though I was at
that time unaware of the relationship."</p>

<p>The spoken word, <i>relationship</i>, jarred disagreeably 
upon him; mind, reason, and heart refused
to accept the hideous fact; he continued to think
and speak of this family, so painfully thrust upon
him, as strangers. He led the talk away from
them. This was easy enough; Ralston was soon
launched upon a full tide of reminiscences, and
in the prolonged talk which followed, the listener
learned much that then and afterward threw light
on the strange events of his life.</p>

<p>The old judge parted with him almost affectionately. 
He had cherished a secret fondness for the

<!-- page 352 -->

dashing young fellow whose reputation he had so
scored during the progress of the suit entitled
<i>Lilla Hilliard vs. Leroy Hilliard</i>. This living
presentment of him&mdash;a Deerford though he really
might be&mdash;awoke pleasant sensations in his old
breast.</p>

<p>Hilliard posted the letter he had addressed to
Helen at her home in Kentucky. It contained
little more than the notification that on that day
two weeks hence he would present himself there
to claim her as his promised bride. The words
were masterful, but perfect love and perfect confidence 
pervaded them.</p>

<p>The same afternoon he started on his homeward
journey.</p>

<p>He reached B&mdash;&mdash; at nightfall. Leaving his
luggage at the railway station, he walked along
the familiar streets of the town, toward the old
house in the suburbs.</p>

<p>Nothing was changed since he had been here
last; or indeed since he first remembered the long
straggling street. The little corner shop where
he had bought his marbles, when a boy, hunched
its protruding show-window on the sidewalk as of
old; the stubby one-legged proprietor within sat
tilted against the counter in a split-bottomed chair,
spelling out the newspaper precisely as he used to
do. He was hard bestead to keep from going in!
And there was the open lot sacred to the circus;
the ploughed ring in the middle looked as if it
might have been turned up yesterday. A little

<!-- page 353 -->

farther on, the brick side walk curved around the
big-bellied chestnut, whose burrs were always
"rocked" down before the nuts within had a
chance to ripen; he stopped and touched the rough
bark with his hand, prolonging the delicious sensation 
of home-coming. But at the front gate his
heart began to beat painfully. The old garden,
sombre and silent under a starlit sky, was full of
shadowy figures that seemed stealing forth to meet
him. Foremost among them, the majestic soldierly 
form in gray uniform, with the beautiful
grave face of his fa&mdash;</p>

<p>Ah! he had no right here! That father was
his no longer! He had been robbed of kindred,
name, and home. Why had he come here! He
had walked up the graveled way to the house, and
set one foot on the lower step. Now he turned
to flee. "I cannot, I dare not enter the old house
to whose shelter I have no right," he thought despairingly.</p>

<p>"Roy! Are you there? <i>Roy!</i>" The door
was flung wide open, and Mrs. Blackmore stood
on the threshold, the hall-light illuminating her
crown of silvery hair. "No, Jessie," to some one
within. "No, I am <i>not</i> mistaken! I heard his
step! I would know it among a thousand! I
know he is here. Or he is dead and his spirit
has come to warn me. My Roy! My boy!"</p>

<p>The sob in the dear voice was too much. He
rushed up the steps and clasped her in his arms,
shouting aloud in the excess of his relief.</p>

<!-- page 354 -->

<p>There was a tremendous clatter of voices and
of flying feet about the old halls and on the old
stairways; a chorus of surprised and joyous greetings, 
and a confused tumultuous presentation of
very young gentlemen in kilts and very young
ladies in bibs, and of unknown brothers-in-law.
For the annual celebration of Mrs. Blackmore's
birthday had brought together all her daughters,
with their husbands and their children. Roy
found himself handed about as the crowning glory
of the occasion. After the stress and strain of
the past few days, the gates of paradise had suddenly 
opened to him!</p>

<p>But later in the evening Mrs. Blackmore took
him into the old boudoir and closed the door.
"Roy," she said, laying her hands on his shoulders 
and looking anxiously into his face, "what
have they been doing to you out there? What has
happened? What trouble or suffering or illness
have you been concealing from me?"</p>

<p>"Aunt Amanda,"&mdash;he overlaid her hands with
his and returned her troubled look with a searching 
gaze,&mdash;"did my fa&mdash;did General Hilliard
leave any papers or messages for me? Or is
there anything you know concerning me which I
have never heard?"</p>

<p>She gave a slight start, but replied promptly:
"Yes, Roy. I have some papers in my possession.
But your father wished you to see them only under
certain conditions."</p>

<p>"If those conditions refer to my knowledge of

<!-- page 355 -->

his adoption of me, I think I may claim them
now," he said, steadying his voice.</p>

<p>She drew his head down and kissed him, asking
no questions. Then turning to a small cabinet,
she unlocked a drawer and took out a bulky envelope, 
and placed it in his hand. "I will come
to you when you have read it," she said; and she
left the room.</p>

<p>He seated himself in the very chair which Leroy 
Hilliard had occupied that night when little
Francis, pattering over the floor, had crept to his
elbow to ask, "Is you my fazzer&mdash;now?" He
looked up at the portrait of the red-lipped lady
whom as a child he had believed to be his mother.
He smiled; by her costume, she must have flourished 
at least a century ago!</p>

<p>The envelope he held in his hand was unsealed.
It was addressed "<i>To Leroy Hilliard, Junior</i>."
And across the top, in the bold handwriting of
General Hilliard, he read, "<i>For my son</i>."</p>

<p>The yellowed pages which he unfolded contained
a brief account of the writer's earlier life, his
marriage with Miss Armstead, and their separation. 
The young man could read into this account
much which the writer had left unsaid. A minute
relation followed of Francis Deerford's sudden
and almost mysterious appearance with the child&mdash;himself. 
As he read on, he seemed to remember 
it all&mdash;the wild-eyed madman struggling in
the soldier's muscular grasp, the travel-stained
child playing with the tasseled sword, the grave-faced 
doctor bending over him!</p>

<!-- page 356 -->

<p>The conversation between Colonel Hilliard and
Dr. Greaves, the physician,&mdash;recorded with old-fashioned 
fidelity,&mdash;came in the nature of a revelation 
to the second Hilliard, as it had come to
the first, explaining what had hitherto seemed so
inexplicable. "The birth-mark or scar across the
boy's left cheek remains unaccounted for," Colonel 
Hilliard wrote. The reader supplied even this
link in the strange chain.</p>

<p>With the decision of the writer to keep the
child, for the time at least, the story, written in
camp, closed. A letter in the same envelope, dated
nearly four years later, was addressed to young
Roy personally. In this Colonel, now become
General Hilliard, stated that, sorely against his
own inclination, he had made a persistent effort
to discover the whereabouts of Mr. and Mrs. Deerford. 
He had only been able to learn from friends
in Louisiana that they had sold Eastwood just
before the beginning of the war, and removed to
Kentucky. They added that the family was understood 
to have gone abroad since, for an indefinite 
stay. He therefore felt justified in concluding 
that they desired to leave the child permanently
in his hands. He had taken the necessary steps
for a legal adoption, and the name the child bore
was now his by right. A will, of which his sister,
Mrs. Blackmore, possessed a copy, secured to this
son of his adoption the property belonging to his
name and station.</p>

<p>He commended to his son, as he grew to manhood, 

<!-- page 357 -->

in the event of his own death, the care of
his, the general's, young wife, and of the child
whose birth was then hourly expected.</p>

<p>"You have become very dear to me, my son,"
he concluded, in a burst of affection. "I cannot
believe that you could be more to me were you
my own in nature as you are in love. I trust that
your eyes may never fall upon the lines which I
am writing&mdash;at midnight in the solitude of my
tent, and with the lights of the enemy's camp-fires
gleaming in the distant darkness. But if the time
should come when you must know what you will
now have learned, you will pardon me if the course
I have taken shall have proved to be a mistaken
one; and you will remember&mdash;whatever may
chance, whatever love or fortune or happiness may
come to you from your natural protectors&mdash;that
I am&mdash;I say it jealously, I confess&mdash;your father,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">"Leroy Hilliard</span>."</p>

<p>The young man had hardly read the last words
through a blur of downfalling tears, when Mrs.
Blackmore's arms were around his neck. "Did&mdash;do 
you know, Aunt Amanda?" he faltered.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, dear! My brother never kept anything 
from me in his life. I knew from the beginning. 
But no one else except dear old Doctor
Greaves ever knew. We were wrong, perhaps, in
not making more strenuous effort to find your
people; for, however Mr. Deerford felt, your mother 
must have grieved over parting from you. If
she is living, she must still be grieving for you."</p>

<!-- page 358 -->

<p>"Mrs. Deerford is living. I have seen her"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah! I feared it! She will take you from me,
Roy!" Mrs. Blackmore clasped him in her arms
as if he had been still the baby boy she had
tended.</p>

<p>He smiled bitterly. "You will judge how much
she wishes to take me into her life when I tell you
of our meeting," he said. "But my fa&mdash;but
General Hilliard's wife?"</p>

<p>"Roy! never dare to speak of your father as
General Hilliard again! His poor little wife
died less than twenty-four hours after he was
buried. The shock killed her. Her still-born
infant was buried on her breast. I had one letter
from her sister who was with her at the time,
giving me the sad details. But she had long been
gone when I visited the spot after the war was
over. And I have never heard of or from her
since. You were with me on that sad journey,
Roy. But tell me"&mdash;</p>

<p>"About Mrs. Deerford. It is not a pleasant
story, Aunt Amanda." He slid into his familiar
place on the rug at her feet and laid his arms on
her lap. The gray dawn was breaking before he
finished speaking. "And so I came home," he
concluded, looking up into the sweet kind face.</p>

<p>"Of course," she said cheerily, "where else?
No," she mused, with a long sigh of relief, "no,
they can never take you away from me now, my
son, my boy!"</p>

<p>He went to bed in a state of complete and

<!-- page 359 -->

happy exhaustion, and slept profoundly for many
hours. He found her sitting by his bedside when
he awoke. "I wanted to say to you, first of all,
Roy," she began at once when he opened his eyes
and looked about, but half remembering where he
was. "I wanted to say, that a man who has loved
two women&mdash;his mother and another&mdash;cannot be
wholly bad."</p>

<p>In a subsequent conversation&mdash;they naturally
had many in the attempt to unravel the tangled
skein&mdash;Mrs. Blackmore, referring to his astonishing 
likeness to Leroy Hilliard and to the physician's 
explanation of the physiological fact, said:
"These are subtle questions, too subtle for an old
woman like myself to solve&mdash;into whose education
the problems of heredity and surroundings did not
enter. But I know something about maternity,
and this is the way I have reasoned out certain
things: My poor brother's influence upon Lilla's
life was powerful enough, as Doctor Greaves observed, 
and as we bear witness, to mould the outward 
features of yourself, her first-born child.
At the same time, from all that you have learned
from her own lips, and from Mr. Ralston, she
must have been very happy during those first
years of her married life with Francis Deerford,
and especially during the time when prenatal influences 
were shaping your spiritual nature. In
consequence of this, you were born with a lovely
and harmonious disposition"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh," he protested, flushing crimson, "you

do not know how unworthy I am of such praise.
But if there is any good in me at all, it is because
of the tender training and unfailing love with
which I have been surrounded since my own father
and mother cast me out!"</p>

<p>"Your environment has had something to do
with it; yes, I admit that. But not overmuch.
On the other hand, it would seem that the months
before poor Allan came into the world were filled
with unrest and misery for his mother; it was a
time when all that was worst in her nature was
aroused; when she began to hate you&mdash;really, I
do not blame her much, Roy!&mdash;as the cause of
her suffering; when the doubt and suspicion of
her husband drove her to a madness which revenged 
itself in cruelty upon you. Is it any
wonder that Allan should be just what he is! It
is in this way that monsters are made."</p>

<p>"What a wise old philosopher you are, Aunt
Amanda," laughed Hilliard.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant thing to him to hear his own
laugh resounding once more through the old house.
His naturally robust and buoyant nature had reasserted 
itself after a season of apathy during
which even the thought of his approaching meeting 
with Helen could hardly rouse him.</p>

<p>"It all seems like a dream," he remarked, walking 
about the garden after Mrs. Blackmore, who
had entered upon the serious business of transplanting 
violets, training rose-vines, and poking
seeds into fat flower-beds, "everything that has

<!-- page 361 -->

passed since I left this blessed old Garden of Eden
four years ago!"</p>

<p>"Not everything," objected Mrs. Blackmore,
shaking her pretty white head. "Not David
French. How I love that dear little David! Not
Red Parsons, nor Abner, nor Amen! Not Billy
Crouch, nor Lorena! Not Helen"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not Helen," he interjected fervently.</p>

<p>"Above all, not Margaret Ransome! I would
not have Margaret Ransome a dream for the
world. How I long to see her!"</p>

<p>"Well, you shall see her, and all of them. For
you are going back with Helen and me, you know.
And we will be in time to see the blue-bonnets
bloom on Mesquit Creek."</p>

<p>They were now alone in the old house&mdash;the
"girls" with their husbands, and the regiments
of white-capped nurses and children, having all
returned to their respective homes. He had Mrs.
Blackmore to himself; he followed her about from
morning to night, as he had been used to when a
boy, pouring into her never-wearying ears Helen's
praises, Helen's beauty, Helen's goodness, his love
for Helen, his dreams of a future with Helen!</p>

<p>He was in no wise surprised or disappointed
that his note to Helen from St. Denis had remained
unanswered. "It means only that she respects
her mother's wishes. But even her mother cannot 
keep us apart. She is looking for me. She
will come home with me. I read <i>that</i> in her beautiful
eyes, at Eastwood! Oh, I understand!" he
said to himself rapturously.</p>

<!-- page 362 -->

<p>The day set for his departure came quickly
enough. The arrangements for his journey were
all made, and he sat, a little before noon, in the
library with Mrs. Blackmore.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">"When from my window-pane<br/>

I gaze on night again,<br/>

I still am lonely, my love, mine only,"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>he sang softly and idly.</p>

<p>Old Robert entered, bringing the mail, and
handed him a letter post-marked "Crouch's Well."
It was from Amos Bagley. He read it aloud.</p>

<p>"Why the dickens don't you come home?"
Amos began without ceremony. "I ought to tell
you that your place is going to rack and ruin, for
that might fetch you. But to tell the truth, it
goes mighty well without you. First, because of
old Manuel, who has got more horse-sense than
any interloper I ever saw [<i>interloper</i>, in the vernacular 
of Crouch's, meant everybody not American!]. 
And second, because the doublets are running 
things. It's nip and tuck betwixt 'em to see
which will do the most. One day it's Red with
his troop of boys, clearing up your west field.
Next day it's Green and his platoon of girls,
planting your east field. The neighborhood, generally, 
<i>bets on the girls</i>.</p>

<p>"Crouch's has got back into harness. No
Deerford that ever lived will ever be able to pull
it out of traces again&mdash;not until all this generation 
is dead, anyhow. (You ought to heard little
David preach the Sunday after you left. He give

<!-- page 363 -->

us h&mdash;ll.) Roper's brother has got back. It
seems he mighty nigh had Deerford by the scruff
of his neck, but Deerford give him the slip and
got off to Australia, or somewhere. The boys run
Roper's brother about it a good deal, but he keeps
his mouth tight shut.</p>

<p>"Billy sets on the fence and chaws the air, as
usual, about the president and the post-office.
Margaret Ransome is prettier than ever.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">"Amos</span>.</p>

<p>"P. S. I forgot to tell you that your water-tank 
is all O K again. Croft and the boys fixed
it up again. There was a barbycue there, and
everybody made speeches, from Uncle Joe Wyatt
down to your humble servant.</p>

<p>"N. B. Why in thunderation don't you come
home?"</p>

<p>Hilliard thoughts leaped westward. "You ought
to see the blue-bonnets around that water-tank,
Aunt Amanda!" he said. "And the wild verbena, 
and the cold-lilies, and the standing cypress,
red as fire, and the yellow tendrils of the love-vine
on the shinn-oak! You ought to see that bit of
prairie of mine in the spring! It is like Jacob's
coat of many colors. It would make you open
your eyes. You've got to see it this spring&mdash;with 
Helen and me."</p>

<p>Dan Roper kept his mouth tight shut at Crouch's
as to his recent pursuit of Deerford and its failure.
But he lost no time, after his arrival in the Settlement, 

<!-- page 364 -->

in seeking the Reverend David French.
He found him stopping over Sunday at Hilliard's
place. "I thought I'd come to you, parson," he
said, concluding a concise but clear account of his
meeting and parting with Hilliard, and the circumstances 
attending Deerford's flight; until the
moment he had lost sight of the Brenda dropping
down the river. "I don't know where Roy Hilliard's 
at. He said he was going over to Carolina 
to see his folks. But wherever he is, he's in
a peck of trouble. And I'm pretty sure that girl
has got something to do with it."</p>

<p>French glanced at the marriage-notice in the
paper Roper had given him, and read the half
column under the heading, "A Romantic Marriage," 
which described the early morning ceremony 
at the hotel, and dilated on the extraordinary 
beauty of both bride and groom. An
extended account of the well-known families, Deerford 
and Wingate, was given. "Mr. and Mrs.
Allan Deerford," the reporter added gracefully,
"set sail, a few moments after launching on the
sea of matrimony, for Europe in the steamship
Brenda. May both voyages prove successful!"</p>

<p>French laid down the paper, and looked over at
Roper, coloring a little. "Mr. Roper," he said,
"can&mdash;can you lend me enough money to take
me there and back?"</p>

<p>"I brought it on purpose." Roper dived
promptly down into his trousers pocket and
brought up a roll of bills. "I knew you'd go,

<!-- page 365 -->

and I never heard of a preacher having any money.
You can catch to-day's stage from Skipton, if
you'll hurry."</p>

<p>When they rounded the corner of Mrs. Ransome's 
field on their way over, French caught a
glimpse of Margaret standing on the gallery, slim
and graceful against a background of vines. She
saw him and waved her hand. He had a momentary 
impulse to stop and tell her. "But no," he
thought. "She will suffer&mdash;for him&mdash;soon
enough!"</p>

<p>When Robert ushered him, several days later,
into the library where Mrs. Blackmore and Hilliard 
were sitting, he was surprised and delighted
by the open joyousness in the latter's face. Hilliard 
still held in his hand Amos Bagley's letter,
which he had just finished reading. "Why,
David!" he shouted. "This is really too good to
be true! Aunt Amanda, here he is! The blessedest 
mortal alive! Have you dropped from the
skies, man!"</p>

<p>"I need not have come," thought David, leaning
back in his chair, with a sigh of relief. "He
could not have loved her after all! How good it
is to see him like this!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Blackmore had bustled away to order
breakfast for this welcome guest.</p>

<p>"You arrive just in time, David," cried Hilliard 
exuberantly. "Like a <i>Deus ex machina</i>. I
am leaving to-night for Kentucky to see Helen.
I shall take you with me."</p>

<!-- page 366 -->

<p>"To see"&mdash;French gasped for breath.</p>

<p>"Helen. My bride to be. I expect to bring
her away with me, David. You shall tie the
knot, old fellow. To think of your happening
along like this! How came you here, anyhow,
parson? Oh, don't tell me. I look upon your
coming as a special dispensation of providence in
favor of Helen and me. We will all go back to
Crouch's together&mdash;for Aunt Amanda is going,
too&mdash;and we shall reach Mesquit Creek in time
to see the blue-bonnets in blossom, eh, David?"</p>

<p>The boyish gayety, the open, unaffected, confident 
joyousness of the man almost stunned David.
He had to moisten his dry lips with his tongue
before he could speak.</p>

<p>"Roy," he began, "Roy, you do not know"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Know what? David! you are in trouble!
What a selfish brute I am not to have noticed it.
What is it? Has anything happened to Margaret
Ransome?"</p>

<p>"No, no. Listen, Hilliard. I beseech you to
prepare yourself for ill news. The morning Deerford 
sailed for England he married&mdash;Miss Wingate."</p>

<p>"That is not true," said Hilliard, with unexpected 
calm. "If any one but you had said it,
David, I would cram the lie down his throat."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> true, Roy. Dan Roper witnessed the
ceremony, and he saw the bride and groom, with
Mrs. Wingate, go aboard the Brenda."</p>

<p>"Oh! <i>Roper!</i>" laughed Hilliard. "Roper

<!-- page 367 -->

does not know Miss Wingate. He told me himself 
that he had never seen her. He means no
harm. He is simply mistaken, that is all. As
for Deerford, I am not surprised at anything he&mdash;
The story is too absurd, David! Why, I <i>know</i>
Helen."</p>

<p>David groaned. He felt like a bungler who
had undertaken to put a pin through a butterfly,
and only succeeded in jabbing the point in a little
way. He took the newspaper from his pocket and
handed it to his friend, pointing without another
word to the marked notice of the marriage.</p>

<p>A frightful pallor overspread Hilliard's face as
he read; his head dropped to his breast; his nerveless 
hands fell on the table before him. David
got up and laid a hand silently on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Hilliard said, with sullen apathy,
as if in answer to some spoken word. "Oh, yes.
I know that you, too, have suffered. You know
what it is to love a woman who does not return
your love. But at least you have not been duped
and betrayed! At least Margaret Ransome is incapable 
of treachery!"</p>

<p>"I will not weary you with words now," French
said gently. "This is indeed a hard blow. But
you will not succumb. My very soul aches for
you, but I know you well enough"&mdash;</p>

<p>"You do not know me at all, Mr. French," exclaimed 
Hilliard, jumping to his feet, and speaking 
in a loud, harsh voice. "You do not even
know who I am! Shall I tell you? It will be

<!-- page 368 -->

only one humiliation the more. Only one more
drop of poison added to the deadly draught I have
drained since I saw you last! I am own brother
to Allan Deerford&mdash;that liar, gambler, murderer&mdash;and 
husband of my promised wife! No, I am
not mad," he continued, again answering French's
unspoken thought. "I wish I was! I am sane&mdash;sound 
in mind and body&mdash;and a Deerford!"
He laughed mirthlessly, striding furiously about
the room. Then, pausing, he faced the astounded
French and related once more the story of his life,
as he now knew it, with all its hideous and painful 
details. The words burst like a raging stream
from his lips. When he came to his interview
with Helen Wingate at Eastwood&mdash;oh, the joy
of it! the gladness and glory of it!&mdash;he faltered;
but his voice gathered strength and bitterness
again, as he went on to describe the scene in the
library at Eastwood, with the woman who called
herself his mother&mdash;<i>his mother!</i>&mdash;and the night-ride 
with Deerford to the railway station. "I
dragged him out of the clutches of justice. May
the devil himself repay me for it! May God blast
Allan Deerford's soul forever!"</p>

<p>"Stop!" said the minister sternly, seizing his
wrist. "You shall not blaspheme. You shall
not take the name of God upon your lips in such
a fashion!"</p>

<p>"And why not? Has He been so tender with
me that I should be sparing of his name! Has
He not ground me to dust beneath his feet! Has

<!-- page 369 -->

He not robbed me of father, mother, brother, sister, 
wife! Has He not even branded me with the
mark of Cain, while Cain, the beloved murderer,
dwells abroad in pleasant places?" He drew his
finger savagely along the scarlet birth-mark on his
cheek. "What would you do with such a God,
you?"</p>

<p>David's pity and tenderness were too great for
words. He realized the utter uselessness of any
present attempt at remonstrance or consolation;
the creature before him was too mortally stricken.
But for his own soul's sake, he murmured:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him</i>."</p>

<p>"Roy!" Mrs. Blackmore's voice sounded in
the hall. She entered, fluttering with pleasant
excitement over Mr. French's unexpected arrival.
"The breakfast will soon be ready."</p>

<p>Hilliard led her to a seat and stood behind her.
"David, will you excuse me for a few moments?"
he asked. He stooped and kissed Mrs. Blackmore's 
forehead. "She is the dearest woman in
the world&mdash;this mother of mine!" he cried playfully. 
"I leave her in your care when&mdash;while I
am gone, David!"</p>

<p>He walked rapidly across the hall, and along
the great double parlors, and entered the little
morning-room beyond.</p>

<p>When he had closed the door, he looked around.
But he saw nothing except the thing he sought&mdash;a 
loaded pistol lying upon the mantel. He seized
it and instantly placed the muzzle against his temple, 

<!-- page 370 -->

his finger on the trigger. A few seconds
only passed while the conflict raged in his soul;
they seemed like centuries!&mdash;light and darkness,
evil and good, death and life, courage and despair,
alternate advance and repulse, struggle, skirmish,
battle-royal! Finally, his own voice coming from
somewhere far away: "<i>Though&mdash;He&mdash;slay&mdash;me&mdash;yet&mdash;will&mdash;I&mdash;trust&mdash;in&mdash;Him!</i>"</p>

<p>He laid the pistol on the table. The fireless
room was cold, but heavy drops of sweat stood on
his forehead.</p>

<p>"Roy!" The knob turned, and David on the
outside threw himself violently against the door.
Hilliard unlocked and opened it. "You were
right, my friend, my brother," he said humbly.
"I <i>was</i> about to play the coward&mdash;and a small,
mean coward at that!"</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Roy. I feared&mdash;I ran after
you," panted the clergyman, still trembling with
apprehension.</p>

<p>"And you prayed while you ran, David, eh?
Well, your prayers saved me. Oh, you need not
lay hands on the pistol! The temptation has been
a sore one, but it is overpast, and now, by God's
help, I mean to live out my days as becomes a
man."</p>

<p>"Thank God!" cried French solemnly.</p>

<p>"You have come to me in the time of my greatest 
need, David French. May Heaven help me
to prove myself hereafter worthy of your saving
hand!"</p>

<!-- page 371 -->

<p>That night they lingered until long after midnight 
over the cheerful fire in the library talking
together, or thinking in unison. When they separated 
for the night, Hilliard repeated: "Yes, we
will go back together&mdash;you, and Aunt Amanda,
and I&mdash;to Mesquit Creek. In time to see the
blue-bonnets bloom."</p>

<p>And only David could have detected the sob in
his throat.</p>

<br/>

<p>The Brenda, about the time that David French
greeted Hilliard in Mrs. Blackmore's library, was
nearing her journey's end. The weather, after
a day or two of storm, was perfect. The gently
rolling billows under the keel of the tranquil ship
were as blue as the expanse of sky above, broken
only by the white fluttering of sea-gulls. A flood
of cold sunshine brightened the deck where Helen
Deerford reclined in her steamer-chair. Deerford
sat beside her. Mrs. Wingate had retired to her
stateroom for her noonday rest.</p>

<p>There had been a long silence between the husband 
and wife; indeed, they talked but little at
any time. Allan had been devoted and tender to
a degree which Helen could hardly have believed
possible; she felt soothed and grateful for his
quiet and unobtrusive attention, but each seemed
to dwell, for the moment at least, in a world
apart from the other.</p>

<p>"That is a pretty ring, Helen," he said idly.
He was looking at her slim right hand which

<!-- page 372 -->

rested on her knee; he touched the pearl with the
tip of his finger as he spoke. "Where did you
get it?"</p>

<p>It was the ring Hilliard had slipped on her left
hand in the summer-house at Eastwood. "Since
Leroy Hilliard is my brother," she had said to
herself, transferring it to her right hand, "I may
keep it."</p>

<p>"Leroy Hilliard gave it to me," she replied,
looking bravely into his eyes, her cheek flushing
imperceptibly. "Do you mind my wearing it?"</p>

<p>"Did he? Oh, no. Keep it, my dear." He
looked out over the wide glassy sea, with his elbow
on his knee and his chin propped upon his palm.
"Helen, there is something I want to tell you,"
he began slowly. She made a movement of distress. 
"It is something which I have never known
myself until lately. Leroy Hilliard is my brother."</p>

<p>"Your"&mdash;</p>

<p>"My own brother. You may well look startled,
dear. When I think of what I might have been
saved if I had only known it!"</p>

<p>He told her as much of Hilliard's story&mdash;and
in his own way&mdash;as he cared for her to know.
It had made a profound impression upon him&mdash;how 
lasting he could not himself conjecture. He
cynically doubted its long duration. But he was
still under the influence of the spell which the
hitherto unknown elder brother had thrown over
him, and his voice trembled with emotion as he

<!-- page 373 -->

repeated, "What might I not have been saved
had I known! What might <i>he</i> not have been
saved!"</p>

<p>He made no reference to his own career in
Crouch's Settlement, but Helen could not avoid the
suspicion that his flight had something to do with
some misdemeanor there. This, however, was an
afterthought. At the moment, a sense of suffocation 
oppressed her. She heard herself saving a
word or two in answer to her husband's revelation.
They must have been kind and gentle words, for
he took her hand and kissed it gratefully.</p>

<p>He left her at a summons from Mrs. Wingate.
She sat up and stared after his retreating form
until it disappeared from her view. Then she
drew Hilliard's pearl from her finger. "Since he
is not my brother," she whispered with dry lips,
"I may not keep it." She leaned over the railing 
and dropped it into the sea. It showed for
a second, a white speck in the air, then the blue
waters closed over it.</p>
