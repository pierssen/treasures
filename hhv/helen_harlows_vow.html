<p>"As I gazed, and as I listened, there came a pale, blue-footed maiden;<br/>

Eyes filled with lurid light;<br/>

Her body bent with sickness, her lone heart heavy laden;<br/>

Her home had been the roofless street,<br/>

Her day had been the night:<br/>

First wept the angel sadly,&mdash;then smiled the angel gladly,<br/>

And I heard a chorus swelling,<br/>

Grand beyond a mortal's telling,<br/>

'Enter sister, thou art pure, thou art sinless evermore.' "</p>

<h2>TO THE READER.</h2>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>KIND READER,&mdash;Again I present my claims to your
attention. Perhaps you will be surprised at my boldness,
from the fact that so few have dared to speak fearlessly for
woman. In dedicating this book to woman in general, and to
the outcast in particular, I am prompted by a love of justice, as
well as by the desire to arouse woman to that self-assertion, that
self-justice, which will insure justice from others. My observation
of life, of persons and things in general, has shown me,
that, so long as any class of persons will submit to injustice, just
so long they must be subject thereto.</p>

<p>That "God helps those who help themselves" is the truest of
axioms; that is, if one axiom, or truth, can be truer than another:
for it is only through ourselves, through the life-forces
within ourselves, that we can be helped. Therefore, the man or
woman who stimulates another to earn a dollar has really done
more for them than though they had given them five; for that
ability, once developed, will bear fruit, some thirty, some sixty,
and some many hundred fold. The same law holds good of
every other channel through which the souls of men and women

<!-- page 6 -->

act upon this external plane of life,&mdash;is as true of moral as of
physical power.</p>

<p>If, then, in writing this book, I can make woman feel that
she need not submit to the injustice which society metes out to
her, in condemning her so much more severely than it does man
for the same offense,&mdash;if I can make her feel this, I have done
more for her than though I had given thousands of dollars
toward erecting homes for fallen women.</p>

<p>My honest opinion is, that whatever tends to make woman
feel that she is helpless, that she has not the power within herself
to rise, after having once gone aside from the straight and
narrow path,&mdash;every effort put forth in this direction tends more
to curse than to bless. Just so long as you gather them in and
care for them as you would for babes or for cripples, just so
long you may continue to do so; but once show them that they
can get up and walk erect again, even if they have stumbled,&mdash;
once show them this, and your work is effectually done.</p>

<p>And more than this: the present state of society wrongs man
even more, if possible, than it does woman, from the fact that it,
in a measure, promises him impunity in sin; thus practically
tempting him to tempt others, while hiding from him the punishment
that must inevitably follow all wrong-doing.</p>

<p>It is not from measures put forth by mistaken philanthropists
to save the individual that we can hope for the remedy from the
present state of things. This can never accomplish the work:
as well talk of dipping a river dry with a bucket. No: we must
go back to causes; we must change public sentiment; and in no
way can this be done so readily as by arousing woman to a sense
of her own power, the power that defies disgrace, and dares all

<!-- page 7 -->

for the right, demanding justice to herself, and according it to
others.</p>

<p>During the recent war, I read a protest from a Richmond editor
that I shall never forget; and, could I see that editor, I
should delight to take him by the hand and thank him for that
protest, for the admission then made.</p>

<p>It seems that there had been a proposition made to chastise a
class of women who gave the army a great deal of trouble; but
this man said, "No: chastise the drunkard or the gambler if
you will; but man has the whole CONTROL of the machinery of
society; and he so manages, that, either directly or indirectly, a
certain proportion of these poor creatures are OBLIGED to sell
themselves to us for our pleasure."</p>

<p>Is it not time that woman asserted herself? Is it not time that
she <i>helped to</i> CONTROL <i>the machinery of society?</i> Will such
results follow when she has equal rights, equal control, in these,
in all matters that pertain to the welfare of humanity?</p>

<p>God speed the day that we can test this question thoroughly;
and, if we fail, we will submit, but not till then.</p>

<p>To this end is this book written, and sent forth upon the sea
of literature.</p>

<h2>HELEN HARLOW'S VOW.</h2>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="small">THE AWAKENING.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p class="small">"See the maiden in the valley,<br/>

Sitting in the sunshine,<br/>

Pleasant sunshine,<br/>

Of a warm and trusting love."&mdash;L. W.</p>

<br/>

<p>BACK and forth, back and forth in the
moonlight, their shadows falling athwart
the windows lighting the little cottage
sitting-room, walked the lovers upon that
autumn evening of the long ago,&mdash;so
long, that the happiest of the two upon that never-to-be-forgotten
night sits now in a home of her own, and
thousands of miles from the little spot that was then to
her the dearest upon earth,&mdash;in a home where little
feet sometimes come pattering about her chair, and children's
voices are heard lisping "Gran'ma."</p>

<p>The luxuriant locks that then floated around her neck
and shoulders in ringlets of glossy brown,&mdash;these are now
showing an occasional gleam of white, and are smoothly
parted back from her high, open forehead, to be confined
in a simple knot at the back of the head.</p>

<!-- page 12 -->

<p>But it is not of the present that we would speak; not
of mature years, but of trusting youth.</p>

<p>Still the lovers continue their walk, and still their
shadows fall upon the vine-wreathed window; while
within sits a woman yet in the bloom of life, but upon
whose features there rests a shadow. There is an open
book before her, from which she seems trying to read;
but the frequent wandering of her eyes, and the occasional
clasping of the hands with a quick, nervous movement,
as if struggling with mental anguish,&mdash;these show
plainly that her thoughts are not there.</p>

<p>At length she starts up, puts the book aside, and murmuring
to herself, "This will never do: I must act before
it is too late," goes to the door, and calls, "Helen,
my child."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother: I will be in soon," is the reply; and
the mother resumes her seat, with, "Dear child, how
good and loving she is! I could not live if harm should
come to her."</p>

<p>The lovers are now upon the steps; and the mother
hears, "Will you not come in, Edward?"</p>

<p>"Not to-night, but to-morrow, or on Monday," is the
reply.</p>

<p>"On Monday?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I forgot to tell you that I am expecting some
friends from town, though I hardly think they will be
here before the first of the week: still, they may come
to-morrow; and, if so, I can not see you again before
Monday. Three whole days! three ages to me. But
good-night, darling," and a kiss,&mdash;yes, surely there was
a kiss,&mdash;and he was gone.</p>

<p>The next moment Helen stood in her mother's presence,

<!-- page 13 -->

and&mdash;"Why, mother, darling mother! what is
the matter? You are as white as a sheet!"</p>

<p>"Not a very white sheet, then," said the mother, trying
to smile. "But I am not feeling just well, though
nothing serious, nothing to make you look like that; indeed
there is not, my child," she continued, marking
the anxious look upon the girl's face. "But sit down:
I wish to talk with you."</p>

<p>Helen took a stool, and sat down at her mother's feet,
still searching her face as though she would read her very
soul. Mrs. Harlow placed her hand upon her daughter's
head, and, shading her eyes with the other, sat for some
moments in silence. Just as the silence was becoming
painful to the young girl, the mother spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You love Edward Granger, my child?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother."</p>

<p>"And he loves you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother. I have promised to be his wife; and
he is coming to-morrow to talk with you about it."</p>

<p>"Why did he not speak to me about it first? How
did he know that I would be willing that he should talk
to you upon such a subject?"</p>

<p>"Mother!"</p>

<p>"I am not blaming you, my darling; but it seems to
me that an honorable man would at least have spoken
to the mother before winning the heart of her only
child."</p>

<p>"Mother!"</p>

<p>"How long have you known Edward Granger,
Helen?"</p>

<p>"How long have I known him?"</p>

<p>"Yes: when did you meet him first?"</p>

<!-- page 14 -->

<p>"At the picnic, one year ago last May."</p>

<p>"Less than a year and a half since, and you were not
fifteen then."</p>

<p>"And you were married when you were fifteen,
mother; for I have heard you say so. You are as young-looking
and handsomer than half the girls now; and I
know that you could marry, and have some one to love
you, when I am gone, were it not for your devotion to
my father's memory."</p>

<p>"When you are gone!" repeated Mrs. Harlow, in a
sort of dazed way, as if she hardly comprehended what
was said.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, mother. I shall live with Edward, of
course. Did you not leave your parents to live with
father? But tell me more about father, mother; you
have said that you would some time when I was older;
and I am sure I am old enough now. Edward says
that a girl is old enough to marry when she is sixteen;
and, if old enough to marry, certainly I am old enough
to be told what you have promised to tell me some
time."</p>

<p>Mrs. Harlow groaned. "My child, I wish I had told
you long ago: it might have kept you from trusting too
implicitly one whom I fear is not all that you believe
him to be."</p>

<p>"Mother, mother! what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that I have learned from bitter experience
that man is not to be trusted."</p>

<p>"Not to be trusted! How could you love, if you
could not trust?"</p>

<p>"My child, my child! how shall I make your pure
nature comprehend the baseness that there is in man's

<!-- page 15 -->

soul? How tell you what I must tell you, and perhaps
break your heart?"</p>

<p>"Mother!"</p>

<p>"Sit down here, Helen;" for in her excitement the
girl had risen to her feet: "right here. Now lay your
head upon my knee, and let me hold your hands in mine,
while I tell you that your father is a villain; that he decoyed
me away from my parents, promised me marriage,
and then forsook me to marry another; that he still
lives, is a rich and honored man in a distant city,&mdash;rich
and honored, with four sons to call him father, but no
daughter."</p>

<p>"One daughter, for I live."</p>

<p>"Ah! but the law does not recognize you as his; it
gives you no claim upon him, because your mother was
not legally married."</p>

<p>"But you loved him, mother?"</p>

<p>"I did: God knows how well."</p>

<p>"And he promised to marry you, but did not keep
his word?"</p>

<p>"He promised, and I believed in him as I believed
in God."</p>

<p>"Why, then, should the law leave the innocent to suffer,
and let the guilty one go? You intended no wrong,
mother, was only blindly trusting; for how could you
love one that you could not believe in? and how could
you marry one that you could not love? And, further
than that, I am his child: I did no wrong in being his
child, and why should I suffer? why should I be deprived
of a father's love and care?"</p>

<p>"You are asking hard questions, my child, too hard
for me to answer. We must take things as they are."</p>

<!-- page 16 -->

<p>"And make them as they should be; or, at least, try
to do so."</p>

<p>"It is easy to talk, Helen; but what can one or two
do against the multitude?"</p>

<p>"They can at least preserve their own self-respect so
far as not to count themselves sinners when only sinned
against."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Helen?"</p>

<p>"I mean that we should not accept the world's judgment
of us when we <i>know</i> that judgment to be wrong.
Yourself, for instance: now, I presume that all these years
you have been looking <i>down</i> upon yourself, because
others, those perhaps who were not worthy to carry
your shoes, despised you. For my part, I would not
marry a man that I could not trust. Why, the Bible
says 'that wives must submit themselves to their husbands'
as unto the Lord. Great claim a man has to
stand in the place of God to woman, if he can not be
trusted!"</p>

<p>"Such talk as that sounds very fine in theory, Helen;
but you would find it quite a different thing in practice.
But where did you get hold of such ideas? I did not
suppose you had ever thought upon these questions."</p>

<p>"Neither had I: they came to me as new as they do
to you. I believe I am naturally confiding, and as naturally
despise deception in all its forms. Be that as it
may, I believe I am ten years older than I was two
hours ago. I feel as if my world had been swept from
beneath my feet, and that from henceforth I must make
a footing for myself."</p>

<p>"Helen, Helen! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Nothing that I can tell you now, mother; but rest

<!-- page 17 -->

assured that I shall never despise myself." Then, taking
up a lamp, she pressed a kiss upon her mother's forehead,
and hastened away to the quiet of her own room.</p>

<p>She had spoken calmly and firmly; but her face was
pallid to the hue of death, and the light which flashed
from her eyes was scorching in its intensity.</p>

<p>"O God! What is it?" moaned the wretched
woman. "Has he won her but to betray? If so, let
her die. O merciful God! hear a mother's prayer, and
let her die."</p>

<p>And how was it with the daughter? Ah! she had
indeed lived an age in two short hours; for in that time
doubt had entered her soul,&mdash;had entered and probed
to depths that she had never dreamed were there,
depths into which she trembled to look; for she was
frightened at the possibilities of her own nature,&mdash;frightened
at what she found herself capable of doing
and bearing. She prepared herself for bed as calmly
as ever, laid her head upon her pillow as though sleep
was sure to come at her bidding; but it came not, neither
did she try to summon it, for she was too busy with
thought.</p>

<p>On the following morning, both mother and daughter
arose unrefreshed; for the couch of one had been a
couch of tears instead of rest, and the other's a couch
of birth: not the birth of wailing flesh and blood, but
of a mighty resolve. A few hours had developed a self-sustaining
power in the heart of this young girl, gigantic
in its proportions.</p>

<p>But few words were spoken during the morning meal.
Helen, busy with her own thoughts, did not respond
even by a look to her mother's earnest, questioning gaze;

<!-- page 18 -->

while the expression upon her face gave that mother a
feeling of awe not unmixed with terror. Indeed, the
girl looked more like a roused lioness, or an eagle, that,
caged, had resolved to be free or die, than like to a
shrinking, timid maiden of sixteen summers.</p>

<p>When the duties of the morning were done, Helen
put on her bonnet and said, "I shall be back before
noon, mother." Then, taking the path which led toward
the little lake beyond the grove, was soon lost from sight.</p>

<p>At first, Mrs. Harlow seemed inclined to follow; but,
upon second thought, gave it up. "It will do no good,"
said she to herself; "and she will return, for she said
she would."</p>

<p>Helen, in the mean time, hastened toward the rustic
seat where she had spent so many hours during the preceding
weeks with her lover. Not that she expected to
meet him there; but somehow it seemed to her that she
must go there,&mdash;that she could think clearer: in a
word, that the solution of her destiny was there. No:
she did not expect to meet Edward Granger there; for
he had promised, that, on that evening, or on the Monday
following at the furthest, he would come openly,
and ask her of her mother for his wife.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she had hardly taken her seat before she
saw him coming; but not alone. A gentleman, some of
the company he was expecting, thought she, was with
him. She did not wish to meet them, but she could not
leave without doing so; and, quick as thought, she resolved
to hide. There was a projecting rock close at
hand; and behind this she seated herself, just as the
young men came around a curve which brought the
place she had vacated fully in sight.</p>

<!-- page 19 -->

<p>They could not see her, but she could see them, and,
when they were seated, hear them too; for, while she
could have touched their heads by reaching her arm
across the top of the rock, her face was completely
screened by the thick branches of an overhanging tree.
Edward would not find her there, would not even think
of looking for her; for he did not know of the spot she
occupied. She had discovered it only a few days before,
while waiting for him, and had not told him of it; for,
maiden-like, she had resolved to hide there and watch
him at some future time, while he waited for her. And
now, with scarcely a moment's thought, she found herself
there, and watching the movements of two instead
of one.</p>

<p>She regretted the step she had taken, when too late;
but only for a moment: for the first word that reached
her ear riveted her attention, and drove every feeling
from her heart but that of an intense desire to hear more.</p>

<p>"So this is the place where you meet that sweetheart
of yours, is it?" said the stranger lightly.</p>

<p>"This is the place," responded Granger.</p>

<p>"And the little fool thinks you are going to marry her,
does she?"</p>

<p>"And so I did intend to, but"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Did intend to?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did; for I really love the girl."</p>

<p>"Why the devil don't you marry her, then?"</p>

<p>Granger shrugged his shoulders. "The fact is, Reid,
she is too yielding. A woman that can be flattered by
me before marriage could be flattered by some other
man after marriage; and I want a wife that I can rely
upon."</p>

<!-- page 20 -->

<p>"Poor fellow!" laughed Reid. "I hope you do not
love her well enough to break your heart over the
matter."</p>

<p>"Don't laugh at me, Reid; for in my soul I wish she
had been firm."</p>

<p>"Well, well: now, that is rich! But what are you
going to do now? tell her that you have been making a
fool of her?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't do that: her tears would be more than
I could stand. She knows that I am expecting company.
I shall send her a note that my company has
come, and will remain, so that I can not see her until
Tuesday instead of Monday. On Monday she gets
another, saying that I am called away on unexpected
business; and, once away, I shall take good care not to
return. I have already written to my father that I will
marry the girl of his choice, sending at the same time a
formal proposition for her hand; heart she has none. If
this girl had remained firm, I should have married for
love; as it is, I might as well go to the devil. But I
would rather go with money than without it; and Miss
Ward has that."</p>

<p>"And have you no pity for the ruined life of the girl
that you confess you love?" asked Reid, speaking seriously
for the first time.</p>

<p>"I have, Will; but that which can not stand the test
must fall. That's my doctrine."</p>

<p>"Hope you will be able to abide by it, then," said a
steady voice close by his side.</p>

<p>"My God, Helen!" exclaimed Granger, starting to
his feet. "You here?"</p>

<p>"I am here, sir,&mdash;here to thank you for the lesson

<!-- page 21 -->

you have taught me. It is a poor rule that won't work
both ways. If a woman that can be flattered by
one man before marriage can be flattered by another
after marriage, a man that would flatter, lie, to one
woman before marriage would lie to her and flatter
others after marriage; and I want a man that I can
trust."</p>

<p>It would have taken a skillful artist to have portrayed
the expression of Granger's face as Helen thus addressed
him; while Reid was simply astonished.</p>

<p>"You pity my ruined condition; but those who can not
stand must fall," she continued, fixing her clear gray eye
upon his with a gaze that held them. "I want none
of your pity, sir. And hear me, Edward Granger;
there is no one man that can drag me down. Had you
married me while I trusted you, you might possibly
have led me to do what my soul condemned; but I
am awake now; my eyes are open, and it can't be
done.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I am not ruined; no woman is ruined
unless she thinks so. And I here swear in the presence
of high Heaven that I will not sink; that, even with
the additional burden you have imposed upon me, I will
rise higher than you can ever hope to rise; and my child
shall take a higher position than any child born of an
unloving, heartless woman, with you for its father, can
possibly reach." And, turning from them, she walked
away with the air of a queen by Nature's right, instead
of taking the position Granger had expected,&mdash;that of
a wronged woman, seeking justice, recognition, through
marriage with her betrayer.</p>

<!-- page 22 -->

<p class="small">"But still the spirit that you see,<br/>

Undaunted by your wiles,<br/>

Draws from its own nobility <br/>

Its high-born smiles,"</p>

<p>murmured Reid, as she passed out of sight.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Granger.</p>

<p>"Only some lines I was reading the other day; and
they seemed so appropriate, that I could not help quoting
them," was the reply.</p>

<p>Granger cast his eyes upon the ground, and sat for
some moments in silence; while Reid, in the mean time,
was watching him. He looked up at length, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"By the gods! I believe I have made a mistake,
after all."</p>

<p>"A mistake! To be sure you have, Ed; but you can't
rectify it now. There is the material there for the
grandest of women,&mdash;a power that you have wakened
into life by throwing her from you, which will yet make
itself felt. But she will never be yours now."</p>

<p>"She has been mine already," said Granger doggedly.</p>

<p>"Well, never again, then; and little cause is left you
for satisfaction in thinking of the past. Didn't she turn
the tables on you well, though! Ha, ha, ha! Her application
of your rule to yourself was rich: she wants
a husband that she can trust, as well as you a wife."</p>

<p>"Hush, Reid: don't laugh at me, but help me to win
back what I have lost; for, by the gods, I will marry
her now, if I can get her."</p>

<p>"You can 'buy the gods,' and sell them too, two or
three times over, before you will win her back, I can
assure you: besides, what will you do with the other

<!-- page 23 -->

one? You have made a formal proposition for her hand,
and she can hold you to it. Father to disinherit, and
the lady to sue for breach of promise: betwixt them
both, I don't think you would have much left to support
a wife with; and as for your working to maintain one,
the idea is simply ridiculous. No, no, Ed: you had better
let the girl alone; she will be better off without you
than with you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you intend to win her for yourself?" said
Granger, looking up with such an air of distress that
Reid burst into another roar of laughter.</p>

<p>"Not the least idea of it, Ed," he replied, as soon as
he could speak. "I have better sense than to present
another specimen of manly honor for her acceptance
so soon after her experience with you: beside which, I
am pledged in another direction, and have no desire to
break my pledge."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed! And to whom?"</p>

<p>"Miss Wayne,&mdash;Miss Stella Wayne of Boston."</p>

<p>"Wish you much joy, old fellow; but must say, at
the same time, that you are exceedingly sympathizing
as a friend," said Granger, in tones of bitterness.</p>

<p>"And why should I sympathize with you? I should
think congratulation the proper word; for you wished to
break with the girl, and you have done it, most effectually
too. But, if you need sympathy, you shall have it.
And, indeed, I do pity you; 'but those who can not
stand the test must fall,' you know."</p>

<p>Granger's only reply to this was to rise and walk
abruptly away. Reid looked after him for a moment
with a half-amused, half-sad expression; then, picking up
his hat, he followed slowly after.</p>

<!-- page 24 -->

<p>In the mean time, Helen had reached her home, and
taken her place at her accustomed duties. Mrs. Harlow
looked up as she entered, but did not speak; for she
dare not. There was a look upon the face of her child
that told of a decision of some kind, but, whatever it
was, an irrevocable one. At length the suspense became
too great for further endurance; and she forced
herself to ask, "What is it, Helen?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, mother; only that your child must walk in
the same path that you have done."</p>

<p>"Oh! not that, not that! He will marry you,&mdash;he
shall!" she fairly shrieked.</p>

<p>"I shall never marry him, mother."</p>

<p>"Why, what have you learned?"</p>

<p>"I have learned from his own lips that he is a villain;
and I have too much self-respect to want such a character
for a husband."</p>

<p>"But what will you do?"</p>

<p>"Live, bear it, and rise above it."</p>

<p>"You can not: the disgrace is too great. You can
never rise above a thing like that: no one ever does."</p>

<p>"Then it is because no one has ever tried hard
enough."</p>

<p>"Oh, child, child! how little you know of the
world!"</p>

<p>"It is not so much of the world as of myself that I
have need to know; and I tell you, mother, that I can
and I will conquer."</p>

<p>"Better death than such a life, Helen."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so; but I shall not die: I shall live to wring
his heart, and my father's too. 'Such a life!' Why, you
are honored, respected, mother; and why can not I be?

<!-- page 25 -->

You have a home, and home comforts, and a child to
love you. Surely a man's love is not the all of life."</p>

<p>"The protection of a man's name is about all, to say
the least, to a woman who is a mother. Yes, I am respected;
but how long would I be so, if the truth was
known? I am called <i>Mrs.</i> Harlow; am supposed to be
a widow."</p>

<p>"That is your business, mother, not mine. I shall
never take even the shadow of a man's name for <i>protection</i>."</p>

<p>Mrs. Harlow made no reply to this last remark of
Helen's; and so there was silence between them for
several minutes. At length Helen asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How came you so far away from all your friends,
mother?"</p>

<p>"I had no friends, Helen,&mdash;none who would stand by
me when I most needed one. My only sister disowned
me; my brothers wished me dead, because I was a disgrace
to them and theirs; my mother wept, and my
father turned me out of doors. Had it not been for my
uncle, my father's youngest brother, whose pet and playmate
I had been, I might have gone to the county-house;
and even he, had he lived, might have turned
against me. But, dying about a year before you were
born, he left me the bulk of his property. I have
always thought that my sister and brothers envied me
for this, and, consequently, were more bitter than they
otherwise would have been.</p>

<p>"But it was his money that kept me from sinking entirely.
After paying an exorbitant price for board and
attendance during my sickness, I had two thousand dollars
in money, and this little place, of which I knew

<!-- page 26 -->

nothing, except that it was some two hundred miles
away. Sick at heart, and glad to escape from old scenes,
I came hither. I was morally a wife, but not legally.
My uncle's bequest was made to me in my maiden name.
I said I had no friend: I had one, and her name was
Harlow,&mdash;the Widow Harlow. After the property was
made over to me, I sold this place to her, using my first
name, instead of hers, in making the deed. This done, she
gave the deed to me; for which service I paid her one
hundred dollars. Not that she asked it; but she was poor,
and, for the sake of her child, she consented to take it. I
had this all done in another county, where there would
be likely to be no questions asked; and then, taking the
money and the deed, I assumed the name of Harlow,
and, dressing in widow's weeds, came hither to hide myself
from the world I had previously known.</p>

<p>"I have always intended, when you became old enough
to receive the attentions of gentlemen, to tell you the
story of your birth; for I thought that that, if nothing
else, would save you from a like fate."</p>

<p>"And did my father remain where he was?"</p>

<p>"He did. The fault of his youth was overlooked. In
time he became a respected citizen, a judge in the
county court; and, his first wife dying, he is to-day the
husband of the sister who cast me off."</p>

<p>"And you, my poor mother, had to flee your country,
to resort to subterfuge and even crime, to save yourself
from further degradation! O God!" she exclaimed,
with clasped hands and upturned eyes, "help
woman to help herself!"</p>

<p>"Woman is helpless," groaned the mother.</p>

<p>"Of course she is, so long as she thinks so; but no

<!-- page 27 -->

longer. 'God helps those who help themselves;' and I
believe it, mother."</p>

<p>"Yes; but what can one do alone?"</p>

<p>"Maintain her own self-respect, at least; and I intend
to do more."</p>

<p>The mother looked upon her child, and wondered;
but nothing further was said.</p>

<p>Some two weeks afterward, Helen saw the announcement
of the marriage of Edward Granger, Esq.,
to Miss Ella, only daughter of the Hon. W. E. Ward
of &mdash;&mdash;. She read it, and smiled a bitter smile, but
made no comment.</p>

<p>Great was the excitement in the little community
when it was known that Helen Harlow was likely to
become a mother; but Helen kept her own council.
She would give them no satisfaction; neither would she
consent that her mother should. Her only reply to
their questioning was, "The child is mine, and I expect
to take care of it; and that is enough."</p>

<p>The storm of persecution raged terribly for a while,&mdash;so
much so, that Mrs. Harlow proposed to sell out, and
leave the place; but Helen still said, "No, mother: I
can die, but I will not run;" and finally things calmed
down, took the form of settled contempt, and the two
lone women were left to themselves.</p>

<p>Two lone women, objects of the world's bitter hate,
because they, or at least the youngest and fairest, had
dared to brave its injustice, had refused to be crushed
at its bidding! A shameless, bold-faced hussy, they
called her,&mdash;one destitute of all womanly feeling; and all
because she suffered, and gave no sign of the anguish
upon which they had thought to feast. For a martyr

<!-- page 28 -->

triumphing in the midst of the flames they had no
sympathy.</p>

<p>For two years after the birth of her boy, Helen Harlow
remained at Lake Grove; but giving no sign the
while to the outside world, nor yet even to her
mother, further than could be judged from an occasional
remark, of the purpose, the plans, of her future
life.</p>

<p>By judicious questioning, she had learned her father's
name and place of residence, and her boy was called for
him; also the first name of the woman who had befriended
her mother. One morning, soon after little
Charles's second birthday, she said very quietly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mother, I am going away. I can not tell just how
long I shall be absent, perhaps for several months; but
I want you to take good care of my boy till I return."</p>

<p>Mrs. Harlow looked up with a question upon her
lips; but the expression upon Helen's face told her that
it would be of no use to ask it, and so she was silent.
The little community was again thrown into a buzz of
excitement. Where had she gone? and when would she
return? And, failing to satisfy their curiosity, they
very charitably decided that she had gone where the
like of her ought to go. "What else could be expected,
to be sure?"</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">A JUDGE IN TROUBLE.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p class="small">"Ah, yes! when years have fled,<br/>

The ghost of past misdeeds takes form<br/>

Within the living present,&mdash;a <i>living</i>,<br/>

Not a <i>ghostly</i> form. Shrink as we may,<br/>

Still we must meet and grapple with<br/>

The stern reality, till pang for pang<br/>

Makes good the claim of justice."&mdash;L. W.</p>

<br/>

<p>JUDGE EDSON sat within his cosy office,
thinking, deeply thinking. A glass of
Rhenish wine had quickened his great
brain to action, and now the choice
Havana strengthened its cogitations. An
honorable man this judge,&mdash;a most honorable man; and
care he had for good of State, its wealth and power,
its moral power; for he a Christian was, and claimed
that only those, who, sanctified by grace of God, had
thus been fitted for the place, had right to hold the
reins of power.</p>

<p>This man, this Christian judge, had, in his youth,
been somewhat wild,&mdash;had <i>sown</i> "wild oats;" but
now, redeemed, made pure, a child of God, he never
should be called to <i>reap that crop</i>. Let children of the
Evil One do that: 'twas fit they should. And so this
Christian man sat there, and thought great thoughts of
woman's love of dress, her recklessness of cost, its evil

<!-- page 30 -->

tendency, how it was dragging down the world, that
else would rise to higher planes of purity. What should
be done? how could a stop be put thereto?</p>

<p>What the conclusion might have been when cleared
from smoke, the world will never know; for, lo! a
knock, a woman's knock, breaks in upon the train of his
reflections. "Come," he was about to say; but, checking
himself, he arose and opened the door.</p>

<p>"Is this Judge Edson's office?" asked a quiet, firm
voice.</p>

<p>"It is. Will you walk in?" said he, in his most
deferential tones, to the veiled figure before him.</p>

<p>"Charles Edson, son of F. W. Edson?"</p>

<p>"The same, madam, or"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss, if you please."</p>

<p>"The same, miss. Take a seat," he continued, handing
her at the same time the best chair in the room. He
had noted, in the mean time, the perfect symmetry of
her form, and decided that she must be handsome; but
this he could not know positively, for the lady still kept
her face veiled.</p>

<p>"May I know whom I have the honor of addressing?"
he asked after a pause.</p>

<p>"Presently. I wish to ask you a few questions first."</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly. I shall consider myself honored
if I can serve you in any manner."</p>

<p>"Mr. Edson, have you a family?"</p>

<p>"I have," he replied, wondering within himself what
connection that fact could have with the stranger's
business.</p>

<p>"How large a family?"</p>

<p>"A wife and four children."</p>

<!-- page 31 -->

<p>"Sons, or daughters?"</p>

<p>"All sons," he answered, wondering more and more
at this strange questioning.</p>

<p>"Are these the children of your second or third
wife?"</p>

<p>"My second or third wife! What is the meaning of
this? I have no third wife."</p>

<p>"Nothing strange, sir, that you should count out a
wife as well as a child; but the woman you are now
living with is your third wife, and you have a
daughter."</p>

<p>" 'Tis false!" exclaimed the judge, springing to his
feet. "And who are you, that you dare to make such
an assertion?"</p>

<p>The veil was thrown back, and a pair of clear gray
eyes met his own. "I am Helen Edson, the daughter
of your first wife. So far as the spirit of marriage is
concerned, she was your wife; though you were <i>honorable</i>
enough to cheat her out of the form, and cast her
off, that you might take to your <i>pure bosom</i> another
bride."</p>

<p>"My God!" groaned the judge, as he sank back
into his seat, and fixed his eyes on the speaker with a
look of blank terror. "What do you want?" he
at length gasped.</p>

<p>"Mr. Edson, by no fault of theirs you are the
father of five children. Through the action of your
life they came into existence; and they, each and all,
one no more than the other, have claims upon you."
The speaker paused to note the effect of her words; and
the judge, as he marked the approach to his pocket, assumed
a cold and hard expression, while the single
ejaculation "Ah!" escaped his lips.</p>

<!-- page 32 -->

<p>"Yes," continued the girl, after a moment's silence:
"they have claims upon you,&mdash;claims such as one
who sits in the seat of judgment, and metes out justice
to his fellow-men, should be perfectly willing to accord."
Again the calm gray eye was fixed upon the
judge, till, growing restless beneath its power, he again
asked, "What do you want?"</p>

<p>"It would have been more fatherly to have said,
'What do you want, my child?' but it matters not. I
have lived without a father's love till now, and can continue
to do so," she added in tones half mocking, half
sad; "but I will tell you what I want, and what I intend
to have. You"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you threaten?" he demanded in an excited
tone.</p>

<p>"Not unless you make it necessary, sir; but I was
about to comply with your request by telling you what
I want. You have a large farm, an extensive practice,
five children, and five thousand dollars in the bank.
One of those children, the eldest, and a daughter, has
never received a father's care nor a dollar of his money;
and she now asks that one of those five thousands be
paid into her own hands for her exclusive use and control.
Is that too much?"</p>

<p>"Too much or not, it is more than you will ever
get. Girl, what do you mean by coming here with a
tale like this? And, even if it were true, how do I
know that you are the child? that you are not an
impostor?"</p>

<p>For all answer to this, Helen Harlow, or Edson, as
the true name was, sprang to her feet, and, taking the
judge by the arm, brought him directly in front of the

<!-- page 33 -->

mirror, placing herself beside him in such a manner that
the light from the lamp fell fairly upon both faces.
"Look!" said she, "and call me an impostor if you
dare."</p>

<p>He did look; and the resemblance was too apparent
to be denied.</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to go through the length and
breadth of your town with that face uncovered?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I presume you have done that now," he replied,
with a tremor in his voice which showed that he
feared it.</p>

<p>"Do not judge me by yourself, if I am your child,"
she responded. "I should scorn to threaten that which
I had already done."</p>

<p>"But what good would it do you?"</p>

<p>"None; only as a weapon to force a judge to justice."</p>

<p>"Force! And do you dare use the word force to
me?" he thundered.</p>

<p>"Why, father, if 'neither words nor grass will do, I
must try what virtue there is in stones.' I read that
long ago in an old-fashioned book; and you know the
moral, I suppose. If not, I will repeat it: 'If kind
words and gentle means will not reclaim the wicked,
they must be dealt with in a more severe manner.' "</p>

<p>Judge Edson was, for the moment, fairly nonplussed.
He knew from the look in the girl's eye that she would
dare any thing; and to have that old story "raked up"
from beneath the ashes of so many years was more than
he dared to think of. For a moment he felt inclined to
grant her request, and let her go; but, his anger getting

<!-- page 34 -->

the better of his judgment, he opened the door and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go; and never dare to call me father again."</p>

<p>She arose, bowed, said very coolly, "You are excited,
father. I will wait till you have had time to
think of this matter, and then call again. Good-night;"
and, gliding past him like a spirit, she was gone.</p>

<p>For a few moments the judge felt relieved; and then,
his fears returning upon him with redoubled force, he
would fain have called her back, but it was too late.
For some days after the above occurrence, Judge Edson
exhibited a nervousness of manner so unlike his usual
self, that it attracted the attention of his friends. He
accounted for it by saying that he believed he was not
well. He would start at every sound; try to catch
every word of any conversation going on near him;
watch for every new face, and especially for every veiled
one: but, seeing nor hearing nothing further of his unwelcome
visitor, he began to hope that the matter was
at an end; that her real aim was to frighten him; and,
this done, nothing further would be attempted.</p>

<p>"Surely," said he to himself, "she is not fool enough
to think she can get a thousand dollars from me!"</p>

<p>Vain hope! Some two weeks afterwards, court was
held in the place, and Judge Edson presided. A case of
the most interesting character was to be tried; and people
were there from all parts of the district. The court-room
was crowded; and all was going on swimmingly,
when the judge was seen to pale suddenly, and put his
hand out as if to keep himself from falling. "Only a
little faintness; but it is gone now," said he to the assistant
judge, who sprang to help him.</p>

<!-- page 35 -->

<p>The momentary confusion past, he looked again; and
again the veil was raised, till he met the full gaze of the
clear gray eye. Yes, there she was, and no mistake;
and, should she unveil herself to that audience, the resemblance
could not fail to attract attention. Would
she do it? And, though forced to wear the appearance
of calmness, the strong man quaked internally, as though
stricken with an ague-fit.</p>

<p>"Coward!" said Helen to herself, as she looked upon
him. "If he quakes thus in my presence, how will he
meet death and the judgment? If he trembles in the
presence of his child, how will he stand before his
Maker?"</p>

<p>But the trial went on without further interruption;
and none but the parties concerned knew of that other
trial, in which the judge himself was prisoner, and a fair
young mother both judge and jury.</p>

<p>It may seem strange to a superficial observer, that
Judge Edson should so shrink from having the "indiscretion"
of his youth brought to the notice of the public
again; and more especially as he was well aware that
the older residents of the place knew of it already. But
men, notwithstanding their superior physical strength,
are really more cowardly than women. They will leave
a woman to bear disgrace, to meet the world's scorn,
alone: they will do this oftentimes, not because they
really mean to be villains, but because they are too cowardly
to share the disgrace which they are the chief
actors in incurring.</p>

<p>True, the older residents knew of the past; but "out
of sight, out of mind" was applicable here as well as
elsewhere. So many years had passed, and all traces

<!-- page 36 -->

of that folly had so long since disappeared, that, doubtless,
they seldom thought of it. And, further, the town
was not one-half as large then as now; and many who
were there then had since removed to other places: so
that, altogether, there were comparatively but a few who
knew it; and they would be likely to think of it but
seldom, unless something should occur to bring it to
their minds anew. And, more than all, he was simply
Charles Edson then,&mdash;a young man, and but little
known: now he was an honorable judge, and had a
good prospect, through the suffrage of the people, of
being chosen representative at the next election.</p>

<p>So you see that he was really in trouble; for, if Helen
made good her threat, her likeness to him, in connection
with former facts, would establish her claim in the minds
of the people; and would they vote for him then? But,
if he gave her the thousand, and sent her away, it would
make so large a draft upon his ready money, that he
could not spend what he wished to for electioneering
purposes. As it generally proves with those who refuse
responsibilities that belong to them, that which he had
ignored had come back to him with interest, and at a
time when he could least bear it.</p>

<p>Well, those that sow must reap; and, if we refuse
the first crop, it becomes self-sowing, with increased
harvests that still await our hands.</p>

<p>Just before the closing of the court, the veiled figure
retired, and the judge felt relieved when no longer conscious
of the criticism of those quiet gray eyes. But the
relief was only temporary; for, as he emerged from the
building, the same figure moved to his side, and placed a
note in his hand. He thrust it quickly into his pocket,

<!-- page 37 -->

glancing around at the same time to see if the movement
was noticed.</p>

<p>"Who is she?" asked a voice at his elbow. And
there stood the man who of all others he could have
wished elsewhere,&mdash;his opponent in the coming election.</p>

<p>"A stranger, I should judge from her appearance. I
did not see her face."</p>

<p>"Business, of course," said the other, in a tone that
brought the blood to the judge's face.</p>

<p>"I presume I can inform you when I have myself
learned the import thereof," said he, with a freezing dignity
that forbade further questioning.</p>

<p>"I will bid you good-evening then," replied the questioner,
in a manner that nettled the judge worse than
ever.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to give my readers the sum and
substance of the judge's reflections as he hastened home;
but will leave to them the pleasing task, if pleasing it be,
of imagining for themselves the nature thereof.</p>

<p>Once safe at home in his own room, and the door
locked, he proceeded to read Helen's note. It contained
the not very pleasing intelligence that the writer
could not wait much longer for a decision upon the matter
under consideration; and requested his presence that
evening at Mrs. Mary Harlow's, between the hours of
seven and eight o'clock.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! this girl will drive me mad!" was
his mental ejaculation. "I am engaged out with my
wife this evening; and it will not do to put her off, that
is certain. O these unyielding, tyrannical women!
how much happier I should have been, had I married

<!-- page 38 -->

this girl's mother in the first place. And they are sisters
too! Well, I might have known that a woman
who would cast off her own sister, and afterward marry
the man who ruined her,&mdash;I might have known that
she would not make a very loving or lovable wife. But
what am I to do?"</p>

<p>The answer to the above question finally took the following
form:&mdash;</p>

<p>"MISS HELEN,&mdash;It is utterly impossible for me to
see you to-night; but I can come to-morrow evening at
the hour named, if convenient to you."</p>

<p>This written, the next question was as to how it
should be sent; for our brave judge had become
strangely timid, and seemed to imagine that everybody
was thinking of and looking after him. He took his
hat, and sauntered out; and by the merest chance, of
course, he soon found himself in the vicinity of Mrs.
Harlow's dwelling. A small boy was trundling his hoop
near the door; to him the note was given, together with
a dime, if he would give it to the young lady, having
first penciled upon the back of it, "Tell the boy to say
to me, 'Yes,' if you can see me then."</p>

<p>Helen smiled as she read the note, gave the required
'Yes,' and then handed it to her friend.</p>

<p>"He will be here, and will comply with your demand
too," was that lady's quiet response.</p>

<p>The lad, as he came out of the gate, shouted to the
judge, who was walking at a little distance, "She says
'Yes;' " too eager to return to his hoop to take the time
to approach near enough to give the reply in an ordinary
tone.</p>

<p>The judge now quickened his footsteps, but had not

<!-- page 39 -->

walked a half a square before he saw Mr. Green, the
political opponent who had so annoyed him some two
hours before, coming around the corner.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Green had neither seen nor heard any thing
of the above: but it seemed to the excited imagination
of Edson as if all things were conspiring against him;
and he mentally resolved that Helen should leave the
place, if he had to pay her two thousand dollars, instead
of one.</p>

<p>The next evening, at the appointed hour, the judge
was at the place designated. But Helen was not alone in
the little parlor: her friend, Mrs. Harlow, was quietly
seated, with work in hand, and gave no indication of
leaving.</p>

<p>"Mr. Edson," said Helen, after a few moments' silence,
"the presence of this lady will make no difference with
what we have to say. She is a friend of my mother's,
knew her, and stood by her when you betrayed and forsook
her; and I desire her to remain as a witness of
what is said and done here to-night."</p>

<p>The judge "hem'd, haw'd," cleared his throat some
two or three times, and finally said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, miss, do you still persist in the absurd claim
that you made the other night?"</p>

<p>"I persist in the claim, Mr. Edson,&mdash;a claim that is
most just; though it may seem absurd to you, judge as
you are called, that justice should be done."</p>

<p>The judge winced. "But justice and your conception
thereof may not be exactly the same thing, miss."</p>

<p>"Edson, if you please," said Helen coolly.</p>

<p>"I deny it: you have no legal right to that name,"
said the judge excitedly.</p>

<!-- page 40 -->

<p>"No <i>legal right</i>, but an actual right, sir,&mdash;the <i>right</i>
of having the same blood in my veins, but not the <i>honor;</i>
for I do not consider it an honor."</p>

<p>"And do you think to gain your point by insulting
me, girl?"</p>

<p>"Just as you can afford, sir," was the quiet reply.</p>

<p>There was silence for several seconds, and again the
judge burst forth with, "It is because you think you
have me in your power, that you would thus take advantage
of me. You deserve to be prosecuted for trying
to get money under false pretenses."</p>

<p>"I have made no false pretenses, Mr. Edson; and, if
you are in my power, you placed yourself there, when
you gave me being."</p>

<p>Mrs. Harlow now spoke, for the first time. "Judge
Edson, it looks well for you to talk of being taken advantage
of because one has the power, considering the
course you pursued toward this girl's mother!"</p>

<p>"And have you known, all these years, where she
was?" was the unexpected reply to this thrust.</p>

<p>"I have, sir."</p>

<p>"I might have known it; for I now remember that it
was you to whom she sold her Western land. What became
of that land?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it is there yet: I do not imagine that any
one has carried it away."</p>

<p>Helen laughed at this retort; while the judge amended
by saying, "You know what I mean, Mrs. Harlow:
who owns it now?"</p>

<p>"I sold it long ago; and it could have changed hands
a dozen times since."</p>

<p>"Well, well: I don't care about the land; but I wish

<!-- page 41 -->

I could have known where Julia was when Susan
died."</p>

<p>"And why do you wish that?"</p>

<p>"I would have married her; that is&mdash;if she had not
been married already."</p>

<p>"You would!" said Helen in a tone of cutting irony.</p>

<p>The judge looked up, as if at loss to divine her
meaning.</p>

<p>"Very certain that she would have accepted you!"
she continued in the same tone.</p>

<p>"Of course, Helen," said Mrs. Harlow. "The possibility
that a woman who has been in a man's power
could say 'No' to him has never once entered the judge's
thoughts."</p>

<p>"I see," answered Helen. "Man expects only forgiveness
and love from woman, no matter how much he
may have wronged her. He can bring her into disgrace,
leave her in sorrow and loneliness for years, and
then expect that she will, of course, be only too glad to
accept him when he chooses to say the word. But it
seems that we have, wandered from the subject. I want
your decision, Mr. Edson, upon another question than
marriage."</p>

<p>Again there was silence in the room, broken, at last,
by the question, "And suppose I accede to your demands?"</p>

<p>"I will return to my home, and give you no further
trouble," was the reply.</p>

<p>"And where is your home?"</p>

<p>"That question has no bearing whatever upon the
business in hand," was the prompt response.</p>

<p>"But what security have I that you will keep your
promise?"</p>

<!-- page 42 -->

<p>"The assurance of one who has never yet proved false
to her word, if she is your child." The quiet eyes were
fixed upon him as if she would read his very soul, as she
uttered these cutting words.</p>

<p>Another silence. Judge Edson seemed to be in the
condition of one who has a troublesome tooth, and has
determined that it must be pulled, but still shrinks from
the final wrench.</p>

<p>"What name shall I use, if I fill out a draft for you?"
he asked at length.</p>

<p>"I do not think you had better fill out a draft for
me," she replied.</p>

<p>"Why?" he questioned, with evident surprise.</p>

<p>"Because you will defeat your own object,&mdash;that of
secrecy. The fact of my calling for so much money, as
coming from you, will be noted and commented upon;
and more especially at this time, when your political opponents
are on the lookout for something from which to
make capital against you."</p>

<p>"And you have taken all these things into consideration?"
he exclaimed in a tone of bitterness.</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir: if strategy is used in compassing an
unholy end, may it not also be used in attaining the ends
of justice?"</p>

<p>"But what would you have me do, if I am not to fill
out a draft?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me, sir, that you are not very clear-headed
for a judge. Can you not draw the money yourself,
and bring it to me?"</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow evening, so that I can be in readiness to
take the stage on the following morning."</p>

<!-- page 43 -->

<p>"I will do so," he responded, jerking the words out
as if they choked him. "I wish you good-evening!"
And, taking his hat, he moved off, as though relieved
of a heavy load.</p>

<p>Indeed, he was surprised at himself: the sensation was
so new and strange,&mdash;that of feeling that he had, in
part at least, compensated for the wrong of the long ago.
He was true to his promise. The money was forthcoming;
and, notwithstanding his forebodings, he was successful
as a candidate; went to the State Legislature, and made
his mark there too; and afterward, while analyzing his
own feelings in tracing the causes which led to his election,
he came to the honest conclusion that that thousand
dollars had more to do with his success than any
other one thing.</p>

<p>"For," said he, in talking with an intimate friend
upon the subject, "I did not know how heavy a load I
was carrying, till a portion of it was removed. The
consciousness of wrong-doing, even though that wrong
was so far in the past, weighed upon my spirit; and that
act of partial justice so lightened the load, that the sunshine
of my soul, lighting up my features, drew more to
me than the money would have done, I verily believe."</p>

<br/>

<p>WILLIAM REID was standing on the
steps of Lighthouse Inn, so called from
the fact that its east chamber overlooked
the little lake, and a light placed therein
served as a guide to parties sailing upon
its bosom the pleasant autumn evenings.</p>

<p>It was the first time that he had been in the vicinity
since the visit made on that memorable time when Helen
had so startled him and Granger by her sudden and
unexpected appearance. Change had been busy with his
life-line, crossing it once with the bridal wreath, and
again with the cypress and the shroud. And now, with
his heart filled with tender memories of the vinelike
nature whose loving arms had clung to him till loosened
by death, his thoughts would wander toward the fair girl
so deeply wronged, and yet so strong in her self-assertion.</p>

<!-- page 45 -->

<p>"I wonder if she is still here? and how she has stood
the storm?" he mentally asked.</p>

<p>William Reid had good cause to remember Helen Harlow;
for she had changed the current of his life-thoughts,
and made a better man of him. Her application of
Granger's rules to himself had started a train of ideas,
which, matured, had given him better, more just conceptions
of life's relations, and thereby transformed the
comparatively thoughtless youth into the reflecting man.
He was standing just at that point of life in which a
word, a breath of influence, may fix the character of
future years, either for good or ill; he was standing
just there, when her firm self-assertion opened his eyes
to the great wrong that man and society at large is constantly
inflicting upon woman.</p>

<p>And, more than this, it had taught him to wonder at
the readiness with which woman acquiesces in this
wrong; yielding to man's demand for the abnegation of
self-respect, when it must fall upon herself, and joining
with him, yea, even going beyond him, in enforcing it
against others. "Why is it?" was the question, that,
in such a state of mind, he very naturally asked; but,
as yet, he had not found the solution.</p>

<p>"I wonder if she is still here?" And, thus musing, he
instinctively took the path leading to the retreat occupied
by Granger and himself when she had burst in upon
them, looking so like a goddess, with wrath roused to the
white heat,&mdash;that steady heat from which undying
purposes are formed.</p>

<p>Reaching the place, he had the curiosity to examine it,
in order to find how it was that she was so near to them
as to hear what they said, and yet so completely hidden

<!-- page 46 -->

from them. Having found the spot, he very naturally
seated himself in it. Absorbed in his own thoughts, he
did not notice the approach of another party, till it was
too late to retreat. Two ladies had, almost before he
was aware, taken the seat occupied by him and Granger
on the former occasion.</p>

<p>"Well, really," said he to himself: "this place seems
to be fated to be one of adventure to me."</p>

<p>Prompted by a sense of honor, he was about to make
his presence known, when the words, "For my part, I
think that Helen Harlow manifests an amount of brazen-faced
hardihood perfectly astounding for one so young,"
fell upon his ear, and made him wish to hear more.</p>

<p>"She has returned, you say?" was the response.</p>

<p>"Yes, she came last week; and black Susan tells me
that she bought herself and her mother a nice new
dress, some things for her boy, and a number of very
nice books: and now, <i>where does the money come from?</i>"</p>

<p>"There is but one answer to that, I fear. But what
else could you expect from one who could do as she has
done, and then justify herself in it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but why couldn't she stay away when she was
away, instead of coming back here to tempt our husbands,
brothers, and sons? For my part, I don't intend
to put up with it. She shall leave the place, if we have
to burn the house over her head."</p>

<p>"So far as that is concerned, I am not afraid of my
husband's going there."</p>

<p>"Neither am I of mine. I have perfect confidence in
him,&mdash;that is, as much as I have in any man. I think
the best of them need watching."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so; but we have no evidence that any one

<!-- page 47 -->

about here ever goes there. And as to burning the house,
that would be too bad; poor Mrs. Harlow has trouble
enough now."</p>

<p>"Neither can we learn who is the father of her child.
It may be your husband or mine, for aught we know."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense or not, Mrs. Sherwood, when one is so sly,
we never know what to expect. I do not believe that
even her mother knows where she has been: for I count
myself no fool when I undertake a thing; and I am sure,
that, if she did know, I could have picked it out of her."</p>

<p>"What does Helen say about it?"</p>

<p>"I have not heard her say any thing; but Susan says
that she overheard her saying something to her mother
about her father."</p>

<p>"Her father! I thought he was dead."</p>

<p>"Well, that don't make it so. For my part, I don't
believe that Mrs. Harlow herself is any better than she
should be. You know, Mrs. Sherwood, that we could
never get her into the church. Our minister&mdash;perhaps
you don't remember the one we had when she first came
here&mdash;well, he was one of the most interesting men I
ever knew; and the heart that wouldn't melt under his
ministrations must have been very hard indeed. He
used to call on, talk, and pray with her; but it was of no
use. He told me, that if God did not, in his infinite
mercy, interfere in her behalf, there could be no hope
for her."</p>

<p>"That is bad, very bad."</p>

<p>"So I think; and, beside, if she has any friends or
relatives anywhere, where are they? and why don't she
write to them or hear from them?"</p>

<!-- page 48 -->

<p>"Perhaps she does. I hardly think, Mrs. Grant, that
it is exactly in accordance with the spirit of true charity
to decide that a thing is wrong because we do not understand
it."</p>

<p>"Certainly not. I was telling husband, only last
night, that we ought to be more charitable, and especially
toward our brothers and sisters in the church,
Here's poor Brother Smith: how they have scandalized
him. But I don't believe a word of it, I don't. We
should remember, Sister Sherwood, that there is our
poor fallen nature to contend with, and the world's people
trying to drag us down all the time. That's just
what I think; we should be more charitable."</p>

<p>"But what reason have you for thinking that she does
not write to or hear from her friends?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, it seemed rather strange to me that
she never talked about them; and I have thought of it
so much, especially since this affair of Helen's: so I inquired
of the postmaster; and he tells me, that, once in
a great while, there is a letter addressed to a Mrs. Harlow
somewhere in Maine; and, after about so long a time,
there is certain to come a letter addressed to this Mrs.
Harlow; and that these letters are always in the same
handwriting,&mdash;that is, there are none sent from this
office to other individuals that are in the same handwriting
with those sent to the Mrs. Harlow I have
spoken of; and all that come to the Mrs. Harlow here
are in the same hand."</p>

<p>"Well, really, Mrs. Grant, you have taken more
pains than I should ever have thought of doing."</p>

<p>"It takes me to find out things, Mrs. Sherwood; and
you know the good Book says that we must be 'as wise
as serpents,' as well 'as harmless as doves.' "</p>

<!-- page 49 -->

<p>"Mighty harmless you are!" thought Reid, as he
listened.</p>

<p>"But this is not all," continued our female spy. "I
think, when we have doubtful characters amongst us,
that we have a right to learn what we can in any lawful
manner which may present itself; indeed, that any
means are lawful that will unearth crime. Paul says
that 'all things are lawful,'&mdash;he was talking of Christians,
to be sure,&mdash;that 'all things are lawful; but all
things are not expedient.'</p>

<p>"Well, I once asked Mrs. Harlow what her maiden
name was; and her reply was, 'Harlow. I did not
change my name in marrying.' And, when I questioned
her further of her relatives, she answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'Our family band has been broken by death, and
there are but few of us left.' And I had hardly left
the house, when that brazen-faced creature, Helen, said
so loudly that I heard it,&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'Why didn't you tell her it was none of her business,
mother?'</p>

<p>" 'None of my business, indeed! I will show you,
miss, whether it is my business or not,' thought I. So
I wrote to the place from which Mrs. Harlow said she
came when she came here, and received for reply that
no one of the name had ever resided there. I then
wrote to the place where those letters that go from this
office to a Mrs. Harlow are always directed, and learned
that there had never been but one person there of that
name, and she was there still. So, you see, Mrs. Sherwood,
that there is something wrong somewhere."</p>

<p>"I fear that there is. But what can we do about
it?"</p>

<!-- page 50 -->

<p>"Drive them away, as I said. But here comes Sallie
Shaw, and Mrs. Fitzhammer, the lawyer's wife. How
do you do, ladies? I am so glad to meet you!"</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mrs. Grant? And Mrs. Sherwood
too? Well, this is an unexpected pleasure, I must say.
Mrs. Fitzhammer, Mrs. Sherwood,&mdash;a new acquisition
to our little society."</p>

<p>"What's the news, Sallie?" asked Mrs. Grant, as
soon as they were fairly seated.</p>

<p>Miss Shaw, a maiden lady of uncertain age, drew
herself up somewhat stiffly.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Grant, I wish you would call me by my real
name, instead of by that childish pet-name."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Sarah, I forgot myself entirely."</p>

<p>"Oh! of course, it is pardonable in an old friend like
you, Mrs. Grant: still, it has become such a habit with
my particular friends, that, if I do not protest, every
one will be calling me so; and that would not be quite
so pleasant."</p>

<p>"I think," said Mrs. Fitzhammer, "that young ladies
like yourself, Miss Shaw, should always be addressed as
Miss. This calling one by the first name does well
enough for children; but, with grown people, it has a
Quakerish sort of look, that is really not very genteel."</p>

<p>"I think you are quite right, Mrs. Fitzhammer," said
Miss Shaw: "but you must recollect that we have not
had the advantages of city-life as you have; and, if you
will be so good as to overlook our mistakes, we hope to
profit somewhat by being in your society."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzhammer smiled graciously, and Miss Shaw
continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You asked for the news, Mrs. Grant. The latest

<!-- page 51 -->

that I have heard is, that that detestable Helen Harlow
has returned. Too bad, isn't it, that we should have
such characters in our midst?"</p>

<p>"Just what we were talking about when you came
up."</p>

<p>"This Helen Harlow, Mrs. Fitzhammer," said Miss
Shaw, turning to her friend, "is one of those shameless
creatures that a pure woman blushes to mention; and,
of course, as she has been absent from the place, you
have not heard her named since you have been here."</p>

<p>"Helen Harlow! Helen Harlow! Yes: that's the
name, I am sure," said Mrs. Fitzhammer.</p>

<p>"What?" "What is it?" "Do you know her?"
questioned the three ladies in chorus.</p>

<p>"No, I do not know her; but I am certain that it is
the same one who is making cousin Ella Granger so
unhappy."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" "Pray tell us about it." "I thought
that we should get a clew some time," were the simultaneous
utterances.</p>

<p>"The facts of the case are these, ladies," said Mrs.
Fitzhammer. "Cousin Ella Ward of Tipton was married
some three years since to a man by the name of
Granger."</p>

<p>"Edward Granger?" asked Mrs. Grant.</p>

<p>"The same," was the reply.</p>

<p>"I knew him well, Mrs. Fitzhammer. He used to
visit here; and, at one time, I fancied that he was in
love with our Sarah here."</p>

<p>"O Mrs. Grant! what nonsense!"</p>

<p>"Of course, my dear, there was nothing in it. He was
a splendid fellow, though. And so he married a cousin

<!-- page 52 -->

of yours, Mrs. Fitzhammer? Well, this is really interesting
news: I feel as if we were old friends, almost. I
must tell my husband of this; for he always thought so
much of Mr. Granger, that he will be only too happy to
make your acquaintance."</p>

<p>"But what of Helen Harlow?" asked Miss Shaw in
an impatient tone; for she did not like being reminded
so pointedly of the failure of her plans in reference to
Mr. Granger.</p>

<p>"Yes; that is what I was going to tell you, ladies.
The engagement was a short one, he seeming unwilling
to wait; and cousin, in her innocence, imagined that it
was from the ardor of his attachment. But her married
life has not been a happy one."</p>

<p>"And this Helen Harlow is the cause of it!" exclaimed
Mrs. Grant.</p>

<p>"I am certain that is the name," continued Mrs. Fitzhammer.
"Cousin now thinks that Granger married
her for her money, and that he loves some one else."</p>

<p>"Poor woman!" sighed Miss Shaw.</p>

<p>"Cousin says that they had not been married a month
before Mr. Granger took to having absent, gloomy spells;
and that, at such times, he is sure to be restless in his
sleep; will mutter and complain; and that, sometimes,
she can understand a word or two. Once she heard
him say, 'Helen, darling;' and at another time, 'Helen,
don't, don't leave me;' and once she caught another
name, which she says sounded like Harlin, Harlow, or
something of the kind. He has been absent for the last
month,&mdash;been to New-York City, he says. He only returned
last week; and I received a letter from her to-day.
But she thinks that he has been with this Helen."

<!-- page 53 -->

<p>"There, Mrs. Sherwood: I knew that my suspicions
were not groundless!" cried Mrs. Grant. "I don't
feel so about things for nothing. It's a warning,&mdash;this
suspicion that will come in spite of us."</p>

<p>"I fear you are right," said Mrs. Sherwood.</p>

<p>"Of course, I am. When we do right, our good
angels are sure to warn us by making us shrink from
unworthy characters."</p>

<p>"Do you really believe that?" asked Miss Shaw.</p>

<p>"Of course I do. The Bible says that they, the
angels as I understand it, are ministering spirits, sent
forth to minister to the heirs of salvation. And what is
the use of ministering spirits, if they cannot minister
unto us,&mdash;cannot make their warnings and encouragements
felt in some manner?"</p>

<p>"I know, Mrs. Grant, that it looks reasonable; but
then the angels are so holy, and we so sinful, that I always
shrink when I think of it," said Mrs. Sherwood
with a sigh.</p>

<p>"I don't know why we should be too humble to
accept what God promises, Sister Sherwood. It seems
to me that you lack in faith. Why, when our good
minister sings,&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">'Angels now are hovering round us,<br/>

Unperceived amidst the throng,'</p>

<p>I sometimes fancy that I can almost see them."</p>

<p>"But what are we to do about this miserable creature?"
asked Miss Shaw.</p>

<p>"Helen Harlow? Drive her away, of course: that
is just what I was telling Sister Sherwood here, when
you came up."</p>

<p>"But how?"</p>

<!-- page 54 -->

<p>"If it can't be done in one way, we must try another.
If she were penitent, now, it would be quite a different
thing; but carrying on an intrigue with a married man,
and breaking his wife's heart,&mdash;it is too shameless to
be borne!"</p>

<p>"Then she has a heart, after all. Granger thought
she was heartless; but he was mistaken about Helen,
and why not here?" was Reid's inward comment.</p>

<p>The trio&mdash;for Mrs. Sherwood could hardly be said
to join them&mdash;went on with their plans; one suggesting
one thing, and another another, till Reid, becoming
tired of his confinement, began to cast about for some
means of escape.</p>

<p>"I have half a mind to frighten them," thought he.
"It would be sport to see them run, and especially that
courageous Mrs. Grant. I am quite certain that she
would show her faith in angel guardianship by a speedy
flight." And, to try the effect, he gave a slight groan.</p>

<p>"What's that?" exclaimed Miss Shaw, starting to
her feet.</p>

<p>"What's what?" asked Mrs. Sherwood.</p>

<p>"Why, that noise."</p>

<p>"I heard nothing. What did it sound like?" said
Mrs. Grant, putting on a bold look, though evidently
trembling.</p>

<p>"Like some one in distress. It seemed to come from
the hill above us."</p>

"Oh, dear! I'm so frightened! I shall faint, I know I
shall," gasped Mrs. Fitzhammer, sinking back like one
almost gone.</p>

<p>"Don't, don't! Oh! what shall we do?" cried Mrs.
Grant and Miss Shaw both at once.</p>

<!-- page 55 -->

<p>"There is nothing to be frightened about," said Mrs.
Sherwood. "Sallie is always imagining something. I
presume it was the wind in the branches above us."
Just then there came another moan, a little louder than
the first.</p>

They all heard it; and the fainting woman, springing
to her feet, made good use of them by leaving the place
as fast as possible. The other two followed hard after;
while Mrs. Sherwood moved more leisurely, smiling to
herself, and saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What cowards! Some animal&mdash;a cat or dog&mdash;asleep
or in pain, perhaps. I have heard our Tray
make worse noises than that when asleep."</p>

<p>Reid waited till they were fairly out of sight, and
then took his way leisurely back to town.</p>

<p>Retiring early, he pondered long and seriously upon
the matter, and finally resolved to seek Helen, and
make her acquaintance.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the next day, he made an excuse to call
at Mrs. Harlow's house. Helen sat with her foot upon
the cradle, rocking her sleeping boy from time to time, as
he showed signs of restlessness, and holding in her hand
a volume of ancient history, in which she seemed much
interested, for she barely glanced at the stranger.</p>

<p>He asked for a glass of water; then made some remarks
about her place, and inquired if she would dispose
of it.</p>

<p>"I would if my daughter would consent; but she is
not willing to leave here," was the reply.</p>

<p>Reid had made the inquiry for the purpose of entering
into conversation more than any thing else. He now
glanced toward Helen; but she did not raise her eyes

<!-- page 56 -->

from her book: and, as a desperate resort to gain her
attention, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope that I may be able to make your daughter
think favorably of my proposition. I have always admired
the place since I was through here, nearly three
years since, with my friend Granger."</p>

<p>Mrs. Harlow blushed; and Helen looked him calmly
in the face for a moment, and then said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I should think your more especial admiration would
be given to the seat by the lake."</p>

<p>"Miss Harlow, I see that you recollect me; and I am
glad of it, for it will make what I have to say the easier.
I shall never forget that hour; neither can the influence
of your truthful words be effaced from my soul. I have
wedded since then the woman of my choice; cherished
her till the grave snatched her from my arms.
But, from that time to this, I have respected you; and
to-day there is no woman on earth who holds so large a
place in my heart."</p>

<p>Helen dropped her book, rose to her feet, and, clasping
her hands with a spasmodical movement, thrust them
out in front, as if to ward him off.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she exclaimed: "coming
here to mock me with the semblance of respect! No
one respects me now," she continued, glancing at her
boy,&mdash;"no one but myself; and do not think to rob
me of that."</p>

<p>The touching pathos of her appeal, words cannot express;
and, for a moment, Reid had no power to reply.
Indeed, he did not reply to her; but, turning to her
mother, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Madam, help me to convince your daughter that

<!-- page 57 -->

there is at least one man in the world who is honorable."</p>

<p>Mrs. Harlow glanced from one to the other with a
bewildered air, and finally asked, "What do you wish,
sir?"</p>

<p>"I wish to be your friend and hers. I know how
cruelly she has been wronged. I know the man who
wronged her. I know how unjustly society is dealing
with you both; and I wish to help you stem the tide of
injustice."</p>

<p>"You can not help us, sir. We do not ask your help,
nor any one's. We only ask to be let alone," said Mrs.
Harlow.</p>

<p>"Your coming here will only injure us; and our load
was hard enough to bear before. I must request you to
stay away in future," added Helen, having so far recovered
her self-control as to speak calmly.</p>

<p>"There is one way in which I can help you, if you
are not too proud to accept it," he said.</p>

<p>She looked at him inquiringly. "As my wife, they
will not dare to insult you," he continued.</p>

<p>Again that involuntary movement of the hands, accompanied
with "Don't; don't tempt me from my purpose."</p>

<p>"I will leave you now," he said, "but will return in
just one month for my answer;" and, taking a pencil
and a slip of paper from his pocket, he wrote his name
and address; giving this to Mrs. Harlow, with "Make
all the inquiries you wish in reference to my character,
position, &amp;c.; and, if you feel you can do so consistently,
use your influence with your daughter in my behalf.
I wish you good-morning."</p>

<!-- page 58 -->

<p>Walking rapidly away,&mdash;for the excitement under
which he was laboring would not permit him to move
slowly,&mdash;he had not gone a dozen rods before he saw
the identical Mrs. Grant of the night before, together
with Mrs. Fitzhammer, coming toward him. There was
the least perceptible start upon seeing him, and then they
moved quietly forward; but, as he passed them, the expression
upon their faces spoke volumes.</p>

<p>"More food for scandal; more food for Christian
charity. Good heavens, what a world we live in!"
was his mental ejaculation, as he hastened forward.</p>

<p>"Just as I expected!" said Mrs. Grant. "You see,
my dear Mrs. Fitzhammer, that people at a distance are
beginning to find her out, and are more bold in visiting
her than those here would dare to be."</p>

<p>"For my part, I am ashamed to be seen so near the
house," lisped the lawyer's wife. "He might think we
were some of the same stamp, you know."</p>

<p>"No danger; no danger of that in the least, Mrs.
Fitzhammer. A respectable woman is never mistaken
for one of her class."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right, Mrs. Grant; and yet I
sometimes wonder how it is that they detect the difference
so readily."</p>

<p>"You dear, unsophisticated child, it is your perfect
innocence that makes you feel so; but when you have
lived as long in the world, and have had as much trouble,
as I have,&mdash;which God grant you never may!&mdash;you
will not then be so unsuspecting."</p>

<br/>

<p>GO with me, kind reader, to the village of
Albright. The time is just one week
after the occurrence of the incidents related
in the last chapter; the place, one
of the best residences in the village; and
the lady of the house one of the "upper tens," in her
own estimation at least. She belongs to that class to
whom Saxe refers in the following pointed and most
truthful lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"Where'er six chimney-stacks go up<br/>

Contiguous to a steeple<br/>

Are those who can't associate<br/>

With common country-people."</p>

<p>The lamps are lighted. The parlor window is up,
and the sound of voices comes floating out upon the
evening air. The blind is partly open, and through it
we catch a glimpse of a lady's face. "The features are
familiar: let us look closer. Ah, yes! the very same:
Mrs. Fitzhammer, the lawyer's wife. But what has
brought her here?" Thus mused William Reid, as he

<!-- page 60 -->

neared the house of his friend, Edward Granger, Esq.
Classmates, and almost inseparable during their college
days, still they had not met since the marriage of
Granger; but, after his interview with Helen, Reid resolved
to visit Albright. So, after finishing up the business
which brought him to Lakeside, he made his way
thither, and arrives there just at the hour in which we
have introduced our reader to the place.</p>

<p>"I wonder what that lawyer's wife is doing here.
Some mischief, I'll warrant," was his mental comment.</p>

<p>In the mean while, the conversation in the parlor
becomes more animated.</p>

<p>"Yes, Cousin Ella, I like Lakeside very much: it is
such a romantic place. I tell Mr. Fitzhammer that he
could not have chosen a livelier home. By the way, I
understand that Mr. Granger used to visit there: indeed,
that he spent much of his time there for a year or
so before his marriage."</p>

<p>"He did, Addie; but he has never since. I have
tried to get him to take me to the place; but he always
has some excuse."</p>

<p>"I would go, anyhow, if I was in your place, Cousin
Ella."</p>

<p>"Of course I shall, now that you are there."</p>

<p>"But there are other reasons for going, besides my
being there."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Addie?"</p>

<p>"I think, that, if you were to go there, you would
find the solution of Mr. Granger's moods."</p>

<p>"Mr. Granger's moods?"</p>

"Yes: of those gloomy spells that make you so unhappy,
poor child."</p>

<!-- page 61 -->

<p>"Why, what have you learned, Addie?" Mrs. Granger's
expression had undergone an entire change; and
one needed but to look at her to know that pride and
cruelty lay concealed under the usual velvety softness
of her manner,&mdash;concealed, but waiting the moment in
which their fangs could be buried in the heart of the
hapless victim.</p>

<p>"If you look like that, I don't think I had better tell
you," whined Mrs. Fitzhammer.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Add!" thundered Mrs. Granger:
"but tell me what you mean."</p>

<p>"Well, since you will have it, I think the girl that
your husband talks of in his sleep is a Helen Harlow of
that place."</p>

<p>"What reason have you for thinking so?"</p>

<p>"She has a boy who was born a few months after Mr.
Granger's last visit there, and no one knows who its
father is."</p>

<p>"Do the people there think it is Mr. Granger's?"</p>

<p>"I could not learn as they did, Cousin Ella."</p>

<p>"Oh! quit your cousining, and talk straight ahead.
You have so much romance about you, one would think
that you were made of novels. Was he known to wait
upon her, or be in her company much?"</p>

<p>"I could not learn, as he was; but you are so cross,
you don't deserve to be told any thing about it."</p>

<p>"It's just what brought you here, though. But I
should like to know what reason you have for thinking
the child to be Mr. Granger's."</p>

<p>"It looks like him."</p>

<p>"Do others think so beside yourself?"</p>

<p>"When I spoke of it, they did."</p>

<!-- page 62 -->

<p>"Oh! fool, fool, that you are! And this is your love
for me, is it?"</p>

<p>"If I had not loved you. Cousin Ella, I shouldn't
have come out here on purpose to tell you this," said
Mrs. Fitzhammer, beginning to sob.</p>

<p>"It's all right, your telling me, Addie; but you might
have been careful enough of the family reputation to
have kept it from others."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzhammer opened her eyes very wide. "Why,
Cousin Ella! I did not suppose that you loved Mr.
Granger well enough to be so careful of his reputation."</p>

"Neither do I, you little fool. If there was no one
but him concerned, I shouldn't care a farthing; but he
is my husband, and whatever affects him affects me. I
know little, and care less, about love; but I have some
pride."</p>

<p>"It is your pride, then, that is wounded, when you
hear him talk of another in his sleep? O Ella! I did
not think that you were quite so heartless!"</p>

<p>"And who cares what you think, so that you keep
your opinion to yourself? I tell you, Add, I am not
troubled with any of your romantic nonsense; and I
supposed that you knew it long ago."</p>

<p>"Why did you marry Mr. Granger, if you did not
love him, Ella?"</p>

<p>"Well, really, you have said Ella twice without prefixing
the 'Cousin.' What did I marry him for?
Because he was the best match in all the country,&mdash;distinguished-looking,
a fine fortune, and an unblemished
character. He could have married any one he chose;
and do you count it nothing that I can look the world
in the face and say he chose me?"</p>

<!-- page 63 -->

<p>"Even if it is whispered that his father chose you,
and he acquiesced rather than lose his fortune?"</p>

<p>"Envy would be certain to say that. But let them
say it where I can hear it, if they dare."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzhammer sat for a while in silence. Two
characters could hardly be more different than she and
Mrs. Granger,&mdash;the one cold, calculating in the extreme,
despising the sentimental in any form; and the other all
sentiment, but of the sickly kind that would vent itself
in tears over fancied wrongs,&mdash;would seek for <i>respectable</i>
broken hearts, only that it might feast its morbid
appetite with expressions of sympathy; but for broken
hearts that had been pushed from the <i>respectable highway</i>,
there was not even a sigh of regret.</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger, in a fit of spite, had spoken of her
husband's gloomy moods, and his talking in his sleep:
in a fit of spite, she had spoken of these things to her
Cousin Adeline, or Addie as she was most frequently
called. But she had an object to accomplish; and it was
for the purpose of securing Addie's co-operation that
she had done so, and not, as Addie had supposed,
the expression of a breaking heart. Granger was
right when he said of his intended, "Heart she has
none."</p>

<p>"When do you return to Lakeside?" asked Mrs.
Granger at length.</p>

<p>"Why, are you tired of me?" said Mrs. Fitzhammer,
starting from her reverie.</p>

<p>"Can't you use a grain of common sense for once,
you little goose? Tired of you, indeed! not so long as
you do nothing to disgrace yourself or me. I wish to
know, however, when you return; for I must go with

<!-- page 64 -->

you, and undo the mischief that your silly tongue has
done."</p>

<p>"Mischief!"</p>

<p>"Yes, mischief. I do not intend that my husband's
name shall be used in connection with any woman's but
my own. I have no ambition in the direction of being
looked upon as an abused wife. Bah! Do you suppose
that I want all the trash in the country, every washer-woman
and every kitchen-wench, looking after me with
glances of pity as I pass along the street, and saying to
themselves or to each other, 'Poor Mrs. Granger!'?
Not I, indeed!"</p>

<p>"But what will you do?"</p>

<p>"What will I do? I can tell better when I get
there; but you may rest assured that I shall do away
with the impression that my husband is the father of
that girl's child."</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Mrs. Fitzhammer. "Mr. Granger is
coming, and a gentleman with him."</p>

<p>The next moment the door was thrown open, and
the two gentlemen appeared upon the threshold; Mr.
Granger introducing his friend and classmate, Mr. Reid,
son of the Hon. R. S. Reid of Oakville, N.H. Compliments
were interchanged, the beauties of the evening
noted and commented upon; and then, but for Mrs.
Granger, conversation would have lagged, for there
was evidently a feeling of restraint upon the others.</p>

<p>Granger looked flushed and uneasy; for he had
caught his wife's words, "That my husband is the
father of that girl's child," and knew but too well that
his secret was out, and he at the mercy of her two-edged
tongue. Reid knew that the presence of the

<!-- page 65 -->

lawyer's wife boded no good; while she, recognizing
him as the gentleman she had seen coming out of Mrs.
Harlow's, was aching for the opportunity of pouring
this item of interest into her cousin's ear. Mrs. Granger
was the only one who seemed really at ease: but
this only made her husband the more uneasy; for he
understood but too well, that, though a cat's claws may
be sheathed in velvet, it does not take long to unsheathe
them.</p>

<p>"You reside in Lakeside, Mrs. Fitzhammer, I believe?"
said Reid to that lady.</p>

<p>"My husband and myself have recently taken up
our residence there," was the reply.</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger's face showed a smiling contempt for
her cousin's affectation; while Reid continued, "I
thought I recognized your face."</p>

<p>"I think you are the gentleman I saw coming out
of Mrs. Harlow's one day," she answered; forgetting, in
her anxiety to give Mrs. Granger this piece of news, that
she was too modest to speak of such characters in the
presence of gentlemen. But she did not forget it long,
and the next moment her face was suffused with blushes.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Reid: "I thought you were one of
the ladies that I met just after leaving there." This
calm reply only increased her confusion; and, making
some trifling excuse, she hastily left the room.</p>

<p>Granger felt as if he was sitting upon thorns, but
tried to hide it, and hoped that he was succeeding;
but the keen eye of his wife had noted all. "Friends
of yours, Mr. Reid?" she asked, with the most innocent
look imaginable.</p>

<p>"Slight acquaintances only," was the response.</p>

<!-- page 66 -->

<p>"Ah, indeed! I did not know but they might be relatives;
and, if so, I thought I should like to call on
them, as I am going to Lakeside next week."</p>

<p>The word consternation would give but a faint idea
of the expression upon Granger's face as his wife made
this announcement. "You see, my dear," she said,
turning toward him with a smile, "Mrs. Fitzhammer
has no relatives but our family in this part of the country:
and she is so anxious that I should go home with
her, that I have promised to do so, as I knew you would
not object; you never do when you see that I really desire
a thing."</p>

<p>Granger writhed inwardly, but responded with an
attempted smile. "Have you one of your old headaches,
Mr. Granger?" she asked a moment after:
"you are not looking well."</p>

<p>"I am not feeling quite well," he replied, glad of any
excuse that would avail for the moment; for, though
unsolaced by love, he, too, had pride, and he shrank from
having Reid know how utterly wretched he was. And
as to not being well, he had spoken the truth; for the
presence of Reid, in connection with Mrs. Harlow's
name,&mdash;these had brought up so vividly the scenes of
the past, that, when he compared what might have been
with what was, he was actually sick and faint.</p>

<p>Conscience, too, was busy at work, showing him
Helen as he first beheld her; telling of the motives
which prompted him to seek her society; how he
had avoided being seen with her in public, cheating
her innocent heart by saying that their love was too
sacred to be shared by any one but themselves till the
time came that he could make her his wife.</p>

<!-- page 67 -->

<p>He remembered, too, how her artless loveliness had
won upon him, till he was resolved to possess her at all
events, honorably if he could not accomplish it dishonorably;
and then that final interview, where she had
borne herself so bravely upon learning the deception
that had been practiced upon her,&mdash;of the years in
which she had rested under the scorn of an unpitying
world, with none to shield the brave young head from
the storm, and still no word of complaint, not even the
name of her betrayer, passing her lips.</p>

<p>All this, and much more, came up so vividly before
him, that, ere he was aware, he groaned aloud. Reid,
as well as Mrs. Granger, was well aware that the plea of
sickness was only an excuse: but, acting upon it, they
had left him to himself, while they entertained each
other; for Mrs. Fitzhammer's modesty had not sufficiently
recovered from the shock it had received to permit
her to return.</p>

<p>But now Mrs. Granger sprang to her feet, with,
"My dear husband, you are really suffering."</p>

<p>"A sharp pain in my head. It took me unawares, it
was so sudden; but it is gone now," said Granger with a
pallid smile. He should have said heart instead of head,
and then he would have told the truth.</p>

<p>"But sha'n't I get you something to take?" continued
Mrs. Granger, with such a look of sympathy upon
her face, that none but the closest observer could have
suspected that she was other than the loving, devoted
wife she appeared.</p>

<p>"No: I don't need any thing, unless it is a turn in the
air. Reid, would you not like to take a walk?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, if Mrs. Granger will excuse us."</p>

<!-- page 68 -->

<p>"I shall not give my consent to his going, unless you
go along to take care of him, Mr. Reid; for I fear he is
much worse than he is willing to own," was that lady's
smiling reply.</p>

<p>Reid bowed. "I shall take good care of him, for your
sake, madam;" and the next moment they were in the
street.</p>

<p>"And so you have seen Helen?" said Granger, as
soon as they were beyond hearing distance from the
house.</p>

<p>"I have," was the reply.</p>

<p>"How does she seem?"</p>

<p>"As brave as ever."</p>

<p>"And her child?"</p>

<p>"A splendid boy, that any mother might be proud of.
Has Mrs. Granger borne you no children?"</p>

<p>"We have one,&mdash;a boy of nearly two years of age. You
shall see him in the morning." And, after a silence of a
few seconds, he added, "You can marry Helen now,
Will, if you wish."</p>

<p>"Do you wish I would, Ed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do; for she is worthy of you, and I should
feel better than I now do if that load of disgrace was
lifted from her shoulders."</p>

<p>"Well, I intend to marry her if she will have me."</p>

<p>"If she will have you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I have my doubts about it." Granger
stared incredulously. "I see," said Reid: "you have
not been cured of the idea, that, if a woman is wronged
by one man, she will be only too glad to marry another,
simply for the protection of his name."</p>

<p>"I should suppose that that would naturally have some

<!-- page 69 -->

influence. And it is not every poor girl, disgraced or not,
that could marry a man like yourself, Will; and, if she
refuses you, I shall feel that she don't deserve much
pity."</p>

<p>"Not pity, but respect, Ed,&mdash;respect for being true
to herself. If I thought her capable of being influenced
by the motives you mention, I should not want her for
a wife."</p>

<p>"So you think that a girl in Helen's position has a
right to look just as high as though nothing of the kind
had ever occurred?"</p>

<p>"I think she had better live single than to marry one
she cannot love, no matter what his position in life. I
should suppose that your own experience would teach
you that."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Will?" said Granger, coloring.</p>

<p>"I mean that you have cheapened yourself in marrying
as you did; that the woman you have is no companion
for you, nor worthy to be compared with Helen Harlow."</p>

<p>"Take care, there. Will: remember that it is my wife
of whom you are talking."</p>

<p>"Legally true, morally false. There is not a particle
of love between you, and you know it. Her expressions
of sympathy are hypocritical,&mdash;only put on to deceive
the world. No: she does not love you; but she exults
in the fact that you are hers, is proud of it. She is perfectly
aware, however, that you have no more love for
her than she has for you; and, when you are by yourselves,
she delights in torturing you. Helen is far happier
now than you are, Ed."</p>

<!-- page 70 -->

<p>During this speech, there was a conflict of varied
emotions going on in the breast of Granger. His pride
revolted against the thought of his friend's knowing how
wretched he really was: he was angry, also, at his plainness
of speech, and, at the same time, fully aware that it
would be useless to make even an attempt at denial. He
spoke quietly, but with a dry, hard intonation of voice.</p>

<p>"I think you must have spent your time since I saw
you in studying the philosophy of charity, you make
such sweeping assertions. Had not you and Helen better
establish a school for the express purpose of teaching
your Utopian morality?"</p>

<p>"There is no use in being offended, Ed, because I
have told you the truth. God knows, I wish it were
otherwise; for I love you well enough to desire for you
any amount of happiness. I have studied this subject a
great deal in the last three years; and I have talked
about it too. There is a lady living near my father's, who
was left in her girlhood in the same condition that Helen
is. The thought of the disgrace was more than she could
endure; and, to avoid it, she married another man,&mdash;one
who had long wanted her, but who was every way
beneath her. She married him before her child was
born; and, moving into a new place, she supposed that
she had mended a bad matter nicely.</p>

<p>"She says now, that that marriage was the worst, the
most criminal act that she ever did. 'I am now,' she
says, 'the mother of one child by a man I loved, and of
three by a man I do not love. The world accepts me
now because I am a wife: it rejected me then because
I was a mother and not a wife, the while I was purity
itself compared to what I am now.'</p>

<!-- page 71 -->

<p>" 'But suppose,' I asked, 'that society should take
you at your own estimate,&mdash;should accept those who
have suffered themselves to be placed in the situation in
which you were: would it not tend to increase the evil?'</p>

<p>" 'If society would punish our betrayers as heavily as
it does us, it would tend to decrease it,' was her indignant
answer."</p>

<p>"Your conversation would indicate that you possessed
her confidence, to say the least," said Granger, in the
same dry, hard tone.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will not think that so strange when I
tell you that she was a seamstress in my father's house,
and my eldest brother the father of her child."</p>

<p>"She ought to have known better than to have listened
to one so far above her socially," was the reply.</p>

<p>"And he ought to have been too honorable to <i>trifle</i>
with any one, to say nothing of the persistency with
which he pursued that poor girl. She could not well
afford to lose her place, and so she did not complain of
him, thinking that she could protect herself. She fastened
the door of her sleeping-apartment, and he crept in at
the window."*</p>

<p class="small">[*A fact.]</p>

<p>"And what became of that immaculate brother of
yours?"</p>

<p>Reid, at this question, burst into a hearty laugh.
"Oh! he has repented, and is now the 'Rev. Mr.
Reid' of W&mdash;&mdash;, Vermont."</p>

<p>"Well, this is all very interesting to me, of course.
When one has done a foolish thing, it is so very pleasant
to be told of it, to be sure!"</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Ed, if I have been too hard on you.

<!-- page 72 -->

I am aware that we are wronged as well as wronging
when we fall into such sin. In fact, society, by the
manner in which it looks over, ignores such conduct
in man, practically educates him to it."</p>

<p>"That's a truth, God knows," said Granger bitterly.</p>

<p>"And things will never be any better, Ed, till every
wronged woman <i>asserts herself, takes just the position
that Helen Harlow has done</i>."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. But what do you suppose my&mdash;Mrs.
Granger means by going to Lakeside?"</p>

<p>"I think that Mrs. Fitzhammer has been putting mischief into her head."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Fitznoodle! for noodle she certainly is; and I
should think it would give any one fits to live with her."</p>

<p>"I don't think she is overstocked with sense, Ed."</p>

<p>"Sense! no. I can't see how a man of sense could
have married her. Still, I have no right to say any thing,
after having shown such superlative good sense in my
own matrimonial affairs."</p>

<p>"Too late to regret it now," said Reid.</p>

<p>"Yes; and that is what makes it so much the more
bitter. But why do you think that noodle has been plotting
mischief?"</p>

<p>Reid now told of his adventure the first night he spent
at Lakeside,&mdash;the conversation about Helen, and the
turn it had taken when Miss Shaw and Mrs. Fitzhammer
joined the others.</p>

<p>Granger looked surprised. "It is an old saying, that
'murder will out;' but I did not suppose that I was letting
it out in my sleep," he said at length.</p>

<p>"And I sometimes think that Nature sickens at crime,
and vomits it up," added Reid.</p>

<!-- page 73 -->

<p>Granger laughed at the oddness of Reid's remark.
"You will never be accused of stealing another's
thought there, Will; for, if that is not an original idea,
I don't know where you will look for one. But suppose
we return to the house. The ladies will think that we
are not very much in love with their society."</p>

<p>"And they might make a worse mistake," laughed
Reid, as they turned their steps in that direction.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzhammer had so far recovered from the shock
she had received as to return to the parlor; but for a
time she manifested a school-girl's timidity, gradually
coming out of it into her usual state of sentimental self-possession.
Music was called for; after which the conversation
turned upon the various nothings so much in
vogue, and, of course, became general, and continued till
the hour of retiring.</p>

<p>Granger seemed inclined to put it off as long as possible;
but, like the day of doom, it would come.</p>

<p>It is useless for me to attempt even to portray the kind
of conjugal endearments which awaited him; but I am
very certain that the contrast with what it would have
been had Helen been his wife was very palpable to the
understanding of him who was reaping as he had sown,&mdash;reaping
the first fruits of a harvest to which he could see
no end this side the grave, if then.</p>

<p class="center">I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to

<p>"No room, no room,<br/>

</div>

<br/>

<p>AT the time appointed, Reid returned to
Lakeside, for the purpose of learning
Helen's decision. Upon reaching the
place, he was surprised to find the house
closed, and no signs of life about. After
rapping again, and yet again, and eliciting no response,
he tried the door; and, finding that it was not fastened,
he opened it and looked in.</p>

<p>The sight that met his eyes was not only unexpected,
but startling. Helen was kneeling beside her mother's
corpse, her face buried in her hands, and seemingly unconscious
of all around her.</p>

<p>"Helen! Miss Harlow! What does this mean?"</p>

<p>She looked at him a moment, as if hardly comprehending
where she was; and then, rising to her feet, she
silently pointed to the motionless form before her.</p>

<!-- page 75 -->

<p>"But why are you here alone?" he asked.</p>

<p>"And why should I not be alone?" was the bitter
response. "Why should I not be despised and rejected
by a Christian community? I, when but a child
in years, to say nothing of experience,&mdash;I was fool
enough to love and trust; and, for this crime, why
should I not be an outcast?"</p>

<p>Reid lifted his hand deprecatingly, as he glanced involuntarily
toward the dead.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I will speak!" Helen burst forth with still
greater vehemence. "I have been silent for years; I
have smothered the bitter feelings that the thought of
my wrongs was sure to bring,&mdash;have kept them in
when they raged like a pent-up volcano: and all for
her dear sake. But she is beyond the reach of such
things now; she is at rest: and I&mdash;I"&mdash;The pressure
upon her overtaxed brain was too great: she reeled, and,
but for Reid's quickly clasping arms, would have fallen
prostrate.</p>

<p>She had not entirely lost consciousness, or, if so, only
for a moment; and there was a faint struggle to free
herself as he bore her to the lounge.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, dear one," he whispered; for the place
seemed to him too sacredly solemn for the loud-spoken
word. "Be quiet; for, so long as my arm is strong
enough to protect, you shall suffer thus no more."</p>

<p>And was it a sin, weak and grief-stricken as she was,
that her head rested upon his shoulder for a little,
with a sense of perfect peace? Was it strange that
her life-purpose passed from her sight for one brief
instant? She had otherwise been more than mortal.
But it was only for a moment; and then the "No, no!"

<!-- page 76 -->

that burst from her lips as she struggled to a sitting posture
was interrupted with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Quite a scene, I should think; but it would have
been more in keeping with decency if you had kept the
door closed." And, turning quickly, they confronted
Mrs. Grant and Mrs. Granger.</p>

<p>There is nothing done here that needs to have the
door closed upon it," said Reid sternly. "When I find
a woman alone with her mother's corpse, and the, to
her, very strange tones of sympathy bring so vividly to
her mind the bitter wrongs she has endured that she
faints away, I think I have a right to take care of her
till she regains her consciousness." He said this very
deliberately, but in a tone that was not soon forgotten
by his hearers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant was startled at the word "corpse;" for, as
we have already seen, she was a coward. She opened
her lips as if to question; when her eye caught sight of
the pale, still form, and she remained silent. Not so
Mrs. Granger; for the fact that Mrs. Harlow was dead
gave her only satisfaction: she could now the more
easily crush the heroic girl before her; and so, with a
sneer upon her lips, she replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of course, such as she can always receive sympathy
from <i>gentlemen</i>, even while an honest wife is forgotten.
But where is <i>Miss</i> Harlow's boy? She can
not be alone, with him to smile upon her."</p>

<p>Reid pointed to the door. "Go, madam, before I
forget that you are a woman! Dare not longer to insult
with your presence one who is as much purer than
yourself as the heavens are higher than the earth."</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant lifted her hands in astonishment; while

<!-- page 77 -->

Mrs. Granger's evil eyes threatened vengeance.
"Come," said she to her companion: "we have demeaned
ourselves too much already."</p>

<p>"But who is to take care of the corpse?" asked Mrs.
Grant.</p>

<p>"Not her murderers, I can assure you," said Helen,
speaking for the first time since their entrance.</p>

<p>Reid looked at her inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Just as truly as though they had stabbed her to the
heart with a knife; but I can not tell you about it
now."</p>

<p>"Of course not. We will first see these dear remains
in their last resting-place. You are not afraid to stay
here while I go to the village, and send some one to do
what is needed to be done?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not: it is the living that I shrink from.
I must have some one, of course; but still, no other
hand shall do what I can do myself. I know," she
continued, "that people will misunderstand me, will
call me heartless, unfeeling, &amp;c.; but it matters not,
it matters not;" and her voice was full of unshed
tears.</p>

<p>"But we must make arrangements for the funeral."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know,&mdash;I know we must," and, as the
thought of losing sight of that dear form for ever
rushed over her, she again threw herself upon her
knees beside the couch, and burst into a passion of
weeping.</p>

<p>Reid waited till she was somewhat quiet, and then
continued, "Where shall we have the funeral,&mdash;here,
or at church?"</p>

<p>"Here: I can not go to the church to be gaped at

<!-- page 78 -->

by those who will look upon my grief as a dispensation
of Providence to punish me for my wickedness."</p>

<p>"They certainly can not look upon it in that light,
as death is the common lot of all."</p>

<p>"Yes: but when a <i>Christian</i> is afflicted, it is because
God loves him; and when a <i>sinner</i> suffers in the same
way, it is looked upon as evidence of God's anger, as
he is said to be angry with the wicked every day."</p>

<p>"I should think, then, that he would be angry enough
with some who call themselves Christians, if deeds instead
of professions are the criterion. But what minister
will you have?"</p>

<p>"None; or, at least, no one at Lakeside: for if,
while professing to be the servants of Him who said,
'Neither do I condemn thee,' they could not call upon
me during all these years of sorrow, they shall not come
now."</p>

<p>"I have a friend at Glencove, that, with your permission,
I will send for,&mdash;an old classmate of mine,
and a Christian in deed as well as in name."</p>

<p>"Any one you please, so that they do not come from
Lakeside."</p>

<p>After a few more questions in regard to the minuti&aelig;
of the arrangements necessary, Reid repaired to the
village; and dispatching black Susan, together-with an
honest German and his wife, to the aid of Helen, he
then took a team from the livery-stable, and went,
instead of sending to Glencove, some eight miles distant,
for his friend, the Rev. Mr. Gordon.</p>

<p>Helen, after he had gone, went quietly at work preparing
the body for its last robing: and only once during
the time did she falter; and that was when little

<!-- page 79 -->

Charlie, awaking from the usual daily sleep of healthy
childhood, cried because "gran'ma wouldn't speak to
him, nor kiss him."</p>

<p>It was not long after it was known at the village
that Mrs. Harlow was dead, before the house was full
of those who came to offer their services: for, notwithstanding
the course they had taken since the birth of
Helen's boy, Mrs. Harlow really had many friends;
and they would gladly have <i>patronized</i> Helen as a
<i>repentant sinner</i>, for they did not mean to be cruel,&mdash;oh,
no! they had no such intention as that. But when
she refused both to kneel to them, or to God in their
presence, they verily thought they were doing God service
in persecuting her.</p>

<p>And so they came and filled the house. Helen
received them all quietly, but Miss Shaw, Mrs. Fitzhammer,
Mrs. Granger, and Mrs. Grant; for, notwithstanding
the rebuff they had received, these last came
with the others. These four were told to leave, and in
such a manner that they did not think it best to disobey.
The others looked surprised; and Helen, noting
it, remarked, "If you knew all, you would not blame
me."</p>

<p>About nine o'clock in the evening, Reid returned,
bringing with him the Rev. Mr. Gordon and his most
excellent wife. Mr. Gordon was a classmate of Edward
Granger's, as well as of Mr. Reid's; and to him
and his worthy wife had the latter confided what he
knew of Helen's history.</p>

<p>Coming thus prepared to sympathize with the bereaved
girl, their presence, like to oil upon troubled
waters, calmed her perturbed spirit by allaying much

<!-- page 80 -->

of the bitterness which she was nourishing to the destruction
of her own peace; for she had not as yet
learned that the only weapon which can take the keen
edge from a bitter wrong is, "Father, forgive them,
for <i>they know not what they do</i>."</p>

<p>The funeral passed off quietly; but the lesson of the
hour was not soon forgotten. The words of the text
were, "Man looketh at the outward appearance, but
God looketh at the heart."</p>

<p>In speaking from these words, he made them the
occasion both of reproof and excuse,&mdash;reproof, not
directly, of course, but in such a manner that each
could not fail to apply it where it belonged; reproof
to the people for judging, without the charity which
puts the best instead of the worst interpretation upon
an act; and to Helen for the pride, which, under a
sense of wrong, had caused her to shut herself up without
explanation of any kind, leaving them to think what
they pleased, simply because, judging from outward
appearances, they had pleased to think wrong.</p>

<p>Then, taking the opposite side, he apologized for the
people, from the fact, that, not being able to see the intention,
they naturally judged from appearances; and
for Helen, by saying that a proud, sensitive nature,
conscious of being wronged, and of being judged unjustly,
was very apt to shut itself in, and bear all in
silence.</p>

<p>Helen listened, and profited by the lesson. She saw
that wisdom, as well as determination, was needed in
the accomplishment of any object, no matter how worthy;
that martyrs for the right often fail just here.
The audience, the while, found their prejudices giving

<!-- page 81 -->

way, and sympathy for the poor girl, now so utterly
alone, taking the place of condemnation.</p>

<p>Helen felt this, and, but for one thought, could have
been comforted thereby; and that thought was, "This
comes from the fact that two respectable men publicly
treat me with respect." Her feeling was, that woman
should be respected for her own sake, and not because
of man's protection.</p>

<p>She expressed something of this in conversation with
Mr. Gordon afterward. "It is Nature," said he; "and
you can't set aside her laws."</p>

<p>"Nature?" queried Helen.</p>

<p>"Yes. God has ordained that man should receive
recognition through woman, as well as woman through
man. Would you be seen in public with a man that
every other woman repudiated?"</p>

<p>"I would, if satisfied that he was unjustly repudiated,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>"You might, I acknowledge, Miss Harlow. With your
strong sense of justice, you could not very well help expressing
your sympathy in some shape: but the masses
can not do this, only as masses; otherwise there would
be no occasion for the heroic bravery of individuals in
this direction."</p>

<p>"But what of the teachers, Mr. Gordon?"</p>

<p>"They are borne upon the shoulders of these masses,&mdash;nine
out of every ten. It is but few of our teachers
who are leaders. And these can only direct the onward
tide: they can neither check nor turn it back, even
though thousands are crushed by its resistless flow."</p>

<p>"How, then, can prostrate ones escape?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Only by getting up and moving on, or getting out

<!-- page 82 -->

of the way,&mdash;the self-assertion that determines to conquer
or die."</p>

<p>"Just the position I have taken, Mr. Gordon; and
yet you blame me for being dissatisfied because"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Because that recognition comes through the legitimate
channel, and you can not see it so. No, my child: I am
not blaming you, but simply pointing out your mistake.
You would have that recognition to come from the
masses direct: I wish you to understand that this can
not be."</p>

<p>"Do not press her too hard, my husband," said Mrs.
Gordon, smiling. "Give her time to weigh these questions
in the balance of matured thought, and she will
have no trouble in reaching correct conclusions."</p>

<p>"Which will, of course, be your conclusions," said
Helen, with a spark of her natural vivacity.</p>

<p>This was upon the morning after the funeral, as Mr.
and Mrs. Gordon had remained with Helen both nights,
much to the surprise as well as the chagrin of the ministry
of Lakeside. But they were not of those who are
"borne upon the shoulders of the masses:" they thought
for themselves, and acted accordingly.</p>

<p>Before they were ready to leave, Reid came up from
the village, and, calling Mr. Gordon aside, held a few
moments' private conversation; and Helen, as they separated,
heard Mr. Gordon say, "I shall remain in Lakeside
till to-morrow, and shall be most happy to serve you
if occasion requires."</p>

<p>As they drove away, Reid stood and watched them
till they were out of sight, and then entered the house.
Black Susan was busy in the kitchen, while Helen sat
holding her boy upon her knee. In her eye there

<!-- page 83 -->

was a look of suppressed feeling, and around the firmly-closed
mouth the indications of a fixedness of purpose that
augured ill for his hopes. She was aware of his intention,
but felt that she could not give her decision then;
so, without giving him a chance to speak, she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will tell you now, Mr. Reid, what I meant by
calling those two women my mother's murderers. They
were not alone, however; for there were two others,&mdash;Miss
Shaw and Mrs. Fitzhammer."</p>

<p>Reid uttered an involuntary "Ah!" while Helen
proceeded. "About two weeks after you were here, I
was surprised at receiving a call from Mrs. Fitzhammer
and another woman, who was introduced as Mrs. Granger
from Albright,&mdash;particularly emphasizing the last
words.</p>

<p>"The eyes of the stranger were fixed upon me the
while, with a look of covert insolence that made my
blood boil. I noticed that mother started, and placed
her hand upon her side, as she heard the name.</p>

<p>" 'What is the matter, mother?' I asked.</p>

<p>" 'Only a sudden pain in my side; but it is gone now,'
she answered: but I noticed an unusual pallor around
the mouth and eyes, while her cheeks were flushed.</p>

"In the mean time, Mrs. Fitzhammer had been trying
to coax Charlie to her. He refused to go, and seemed
afraid; so much so, that I took him upon my lap to quiet
him. The woman from Albright had been devouring
him with her eyes; and she now broke out with, 'What
nonsense, Add, for you to think that that child looks
like my husband!' Here mother rose to her feet; and,
but for a look from me, I believe she would have turned
them out of the house.</p>

<!-- page 84 -->

<p>"But I was desirous of hearing what they would say,
and so I motioned her to be silent.</p>

<p>" 'I knew,' continued the woman, 'that it could not
be: he is too honorable a man for that. He wouldn't
do such a thing as to deceive and betray one girl, when
he was engaged to another.' "</p>

<p>"Indeed!" was Reid's sarcastic response; his feelings
being too intensely stirred to permit entire silence.</p>

<p>" 'I am sorry, Cousin Ella, to have wronged him, even
in thought; and hope you will forgive me. I should not
have thought of it, had not my attention been turned
in that direction,' said Mrs. Fitzhammer.</p>

<p>" 'Certainly, certainly, Addie: we are all liable to
mistakes. But I will tell you who he is the very image
of; and, if this girl will own the truth, she will say that
I am right. You recollect that writing-master who
came to Albright between three and four years ago,&mdash;about
four, I think? He was smart, handsome, and just
the one to flatter one who knew nothing of the ways of
the world.</p>

<p>" 'He made love to several of the ladies of Albright,
but did not succeed in deceiving them. He came, I am
told, to Lakeside, and from here to Denton. At this
last place, he courted one of the first young ladies in
town; and every thing was ready for the wedding, when
the officers came and took him away, saying that he had
broken jail somewhere down in New Hampshire, and he
was really a desperate character.'</p>

<p>" 'The good-for-nothing fellow!' said Mrs. Fitzhammer.
'He ought to be in prison; or any other man who will
deceive a poor girl in this way.'</p>

<p>"I had heard enough; so I said to them, 'Ladies,

<!-- page 85 -->

it will be just as agreeable to me if you will discuss my
affairs elsewhere.'</p>

<p>"Mother could no longer be restrained. I never saw
her so excited. 'What you say is false, and you know
it!' she exclaimed. 'You came here on purpose to insult
us: your expressions of sympathy are as false as your
own hollow hearts, and may'&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'Mother! don't, don't say any thing that you will
be sorry for,' I interposed.</p>

<p>"By this time, the <i>intruders</i> (Reid smiled to see how
studiously she avoided calling them <i>ladies</i>) were beyond
hearing; for the vehemence of mother's look and manner
so startled them, that they moved with no laggard
steps."</p>

<p>"The woman from Albright came here at Mrs. Fitzhammer's
instigation," remarked Reid.</p>

<p>"<i>The woman from Albright</i>"! How Helen thanked
him in her heart for the sympathy thus indicated.</p>

<p>She looked at him inquiringly. He hesitated a moment,
and then said, "You recollect the time, when,
from your retreat in the rocks, you burst in upon us so
unceremoniously? Well, we were so much startled by
what you said, that we took no notice of your hiding-place;
but, on my return to Lakeside, I had a curiosity
to examine it. I did so; then sat down to ponder,
and got caught there,&mdash;not exactly caught, either; for I
was not discovered: but those who sat there, and slandered
and planned, and planned and slandered, little imagined
that they had an unseen auditor."</p>

<p>"So you played eavesdropper, did you?" laughed
Helen.</p>

<p>"Not intentionally, but most effectually; for I not

<!-- page 86 -->

only learned that you had been absent and had returned,
but that they intended to drive you away.
Mrs. Fitzhammer, or Fitznoodle as Granger calls her,"&mdash;he
glanced furtively at her as he pronounced that
name, and was sorry to see a spasmodic contraction of
the muscles about the mouth, as if from sudden pain
("She loves him still! I fear there is little hope for
me," was his inward comment); but he continued,&mdash;"had
heard your name from her Cousin Ella; and she
had gathered it from Granger, as he muttered it in his
sleep.</p>

<p>"The woman had no idea as to who you were, or
where you lived; but when Noodle, here, came to Lakeside,
and heard you spoken of, she concluded that you
were the same, and, putting this and that together, drew
her own conclusions as to the parentage of your child.
Of course, with such a precious morsel of gossip, she
had to go to Albright as quickly as she could get there.</p>

<p>"Ella Ward was a proud girl: she is proud still,&mdash;so
proud that she would stop at nothing. I hardly think
murder itself would deter her, if she could thus avert
threatened disgrace from any one connected with her;
that is, could she so plan it as to escape detection. As
to love, I doubt if she knows what it is; but she is as
cruel as she is proud, and as deceitful as cruel,&mdash;a perfect
snake in the grass, unless she has one fast, and
then she does not hesitate to show her colors."</p>

<p>Helen listened more for another than for herself; that
is, wronged and disgraced as she was, the prevailing feeling
in her woman's heart was pity for the man who
called such a woman wife.</p>

<p>Reid noted each expression of her face, and read them

<!-- page 87 -->

aright too; but he continued: "I fear, Helen, that she
will do you some serious injury yet."</p>

<p>"She has done so already: she has killed my mother."
She paused a little, in order to gain more self-control,
and then resumed the narration which had been interrupted
by Reid's remarks.</p>

<p>"I used every means in my power to soothe mother's
excited feelings. I had noticed, since my return from
Maine, that she was not as strong as usual; and I feared
that she would be sick in consequence. She calmed
down after a little, or, at least, she seemed calm; but I
now know that it was only the seeming; for before night
she was in a high fever, and with so much pain in her
head, that, for several hours, she was delirious.</p>

<p>"Toward morning she became quiet, and slept some;
but it was several days before she so far recovered as to
seem like herself. In the mean time, I had found a note
under the door, one morning, directed to me, and demanding
that I should leave the place. I kept this from
mother, of course. Three mornings afterward, I found
another of the same purport, only more threatening.
I think mother must have found something of the kind,
too, from the way she looked and acted.</p>

<p>"In just three days more, I found another. I am
quite certain that mother saw me pick that up, though
she said nothing. All that day she had a sort of helpless,
bewildered look,&mdash;like to one who has struggled
and given up. It was pitiful, and I could hardly bear
it; still, I did not let her know that I noticed it.</p>

<p>"This last note stated, that, if there were not some
signs of leaving by such a time, there would be measures
taken to make me go. That night I saw all four of the

<!-- page 88 -->

women I have named prowling around the house. They
staid perhaps an hour, but left without any offensive
demonstrations. The next day, mother seemed much
better: still, I trembled all the time,&mdash;not for myself, but
for her; for I knew that there was mischief plotting.</p>

<p>"The time came named in the note. The day passed
off as usual; but, just after midnight, there came a loud
rap upon the door, when the woman from Albright&mdash;I
knew her by her voice&mdash;called out, 'Wait a moment:
we haven't the tar and feathers quite ready.' "</p>

<p>"My God!" exclaimed Reid; "I wish I had been
here!"</p>

<p>"Mother screamed and fainted; came to, and fainted
again. I had all I could do to keep her from going into
convulsions. This lasted for an hour, I should think.
There had been no further disturbance during the time;
but, just as I had succeeded in quieting her somewhat,
there came a heavy stone against the door, and another
crashing through the window.</p>

<p>"This was the night but one before you returned.
There were no further signs of hostility; but, from that
hour, mother sank rapidly. I did not summon a physician,
for I felt that it would be of no use; and, further,
why should she stay here to suffer? I know that she
is at rest now; and it is easier to bear my load alone
than to feel that she is grieving over me all the time."</p>

<p>And then, as if utterly broken down with a sense of
her desolation, she bowed her head upon her boy's
bright curls, and wailed, "O mother, mother!"</p>

<p>"Not alone, dear one, if you will only give me the
right to protect you," said Reid tenderly.</p>

<p>"Don't! oh, don't!" she fairly shrieked. "I have

<!-- page 89 -->

vowed; and I can not go back, I will not go back!
I must stand alone, and vindicate the sex that would
crush me,&mdash;must show them that a woman is not
ruined because she has trusted and been deceived."</p>

<p>"Helen! Miss Harlow! listen to me."</p>

<p>"No, I will not listen to you. I listened to one
man, to my everlasting sorrow."</p>

<p>Reid was silent; while Helen was shaken like a leaf
in the wind with the tempest of her grief.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said she, after the storm of feeling
had somewhat subsided: "I did not intend to be unjust;
but it can not be."</p>

<p>"You are unjust to yourself," he said.</p>

<p>"I should be, if I should listen to you,&mdash;both to you
and to myself. I respect you more than any other
man living; but my heart is dead within me. I have
no love for any one; and I can conceive of no greater
wrong to man, or woman either, than marriage without
love."</p>

<p>"I will take the responsibility of bringing your dead
heart to life with the warmth of my love, if you will
only give me the opportunity."</p>

<p>"But I dare not take the responsibility of giving you
the opportunity. Not loving you, it would be unjust to
you; and, if I did love you, I certainly could not lay
such a burden upon you."</p>

<p>"But what will you do here all alone?"</p>

<p>"I have not had time to decide yet, but shall be able
to form some plan in a few days. I do not think my
persecutors will trouble me any more just yet; and to
marry now, even if there were no other objection, I
would not; for it would look as though I did it simply
for protection."</p>

<!-- page 90 -->

<p>"O Helen, Helen! how proud you are!"</p>

<p>"It may be pride, though I had not looked upon it
in that light."</p>

<p>"It certainly is pride,&mdash;pride that stands in the
way both of your happiness and mine."</p>

<p>"Not of mine, Mr. Reid; for, from henceforth, there
is no happiness for me but in carrying out my purpose,&mdash;that
of educating my boy, and forcing the world to
respect both him and his mother."</p>

<p>"And when your own nobleness has won to you one
who would so gladly aid you in carrying out your purpose,
you will not accept what you have won."</p>

<p>"To do as you wish would defeat my purpose; for
it is <i>alone</i>, and not under the shadow of a man's name,
that I must do this. No, it is of no use: I must bear
my burden ALONE."</p>

<div class="center" id="ch06">

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">A WOMAN'S HATE.</p>

<br/>

<p class="small">"Hell has no fury like a woman scorned."</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>CONSIDERING the relative positions of
Mrs. Granger and Helen, it would seem
strange to apply the above to the former;
for Helen, to all appearance, was the one
scorned. But really it was not so; and
Mrs. Granger knew it. She knew in her soul that her
husband had more respect, more love, for Helen Harlow
than for any other woman living.</p>

<p>She cared not for his love, only so far as appearances
were concerned; but that he should love another
aroused all the vindictiveness of her nature: and,
further, that the public should see and note it, as she felt
that it would, now that there had been a clew given,&mdash;an
indication in that direction.</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger, though destitute of those traits of
character which make woman lovely, make her
worthy of the name, was still a very close reasoner.
She knew, that, when once the trail was found, a more
than bloodhound keenness was sure to follow it up; and
how she cursed the folly of the woman, who, thinking
to serve her, had given that clew! She went farther
back than that: she cursed herself for the folly that

<!-- page 92 -->

had led her even to mention aught of her domestic
affairs to "the rattle-pate."</p>

<p>The woman fairly writhed as she thought of the
comments that would be made among both high and
low; aggravating herself still more by dwelling upon
them, putting them into words, and repeating them
over and over: "There goes Granger's wife,&mdash;a mighty
proud woman! But they say her husband doesn't care
much for her: they say he has a boy at Lakeside not
much older than the one he has by his wife."</p>

<p>And again: "They say that Granger's boy at Lakeside
is smarter and better looking than any he has at
home;" or, "I wonder if he does nothing toward the
support of that child and his mother?" or, "They say
that he loves that girl now better than he does his
wife." And again: "She is younger and better looking
than his wife: he was a fool for not marrying her."
"Oh! you know that old Ward was rich, and this girl
poor: and that makes all the difference in the world."</p>

<p>And thus the miserable woman tortured herself, till,
becoming desperate, she resolved upon desperate means
to put an end to such annoyances. Helen thought that
she would be let alone for a while,&mdash;long enough to enable
her to think and plan for the future; but in this she was
mistaken. True, so far as those who lived at Lakeside
were concerned, there would have been no further
trouble whatever; for the death of Mrs. Harlow, together
with the influence of Mr. Gordon in his excellent sermon,
had so softened their feelings that they were willing
to give her a chance to live, to say the least.</p>

<p>But with Mrs. Granger it was different. The more
the feelings of the people were softened toward Helen,

<!-- page 93 -->

the more bitter she became; and, on the very night of
all others when one would suppose that there could be
no heart hard enough to disturb the doubly desolate
girl,&mdash;the first night after the funeral upon which she had
been alone with her child and Susan,&mdash;there were steps
taken that would have sent her and her boy beyond the
reach of earthly malice, had it not been for one of those
unaccountable occurrences which so often frustrate the
best-laid plans. Sleeping as soundly as they were, with
the exhaustion which follows excitement of all kinds, and
especially that of grief, but for this they would not have
waked till too late.</p>

<p>Reid had seen Mrs. Granger in town just at dusk; and
there was something in her look that gave him an uneasy
sensation, though, after the moment, he thought little of
it. Still, he learned, afterward, that there had been inquiries
made about nine o'clock in the evening, to learn
if he was at the inn. He had retired early; and the boy
said that Mrs. Granger wished to see him before she returned
to Albright, but that in the morning would do
as well, if he would call before the stage went out.</p>

<p>About eleven o'clock, Reid was wakened out of a
sound sleep very suddenly; and with so strong a feeling
of something wrong somewhere, that he found it impossible
to sleep again. Under an influence for which he
could not account, he arose, dressed, and walked out into
the open air. Once out of doors, he involuntarily took the
road leading toward Mrs. Harlow's, and had traversed
more than half the distance before he was aware of the
fact.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" he asked as he came to
himself. "What a fool I am! I'll go back and go to

<!-- page 94 -->

bed again;" and, as he supposed, suiting the action to the
word, started back; but, instead of doing so, he kept
straight ahead, not knowing the difference till he came
in sight of Helen's house. Here he stopped again,
cursed himself for the infatuation that seemed determined
to take him there in spite of fate, and would really have
turned back, had he not caught sight of a female form
ahead of him, and a little to one side, stealing with cat-like
tread through the bushes.</p>

<p>Every sense was now fully awake; and, stepping quickly
into the shadow of a large oak, he watched the movements
of the figure ahead of him. She seemed to have
caught a faint sound; for she stopped, looked back, and
appeared half inclined to go back, but finally went on.
Having reached the house, she paused a while, listened
intently, looked in every direction; and, seeming satisfied
that all was right, she proceeded to gather together some
chips, shavings, and what other combustible material she
could find. This done, she applied a match to the whole,
watched till she saw that it was beginning to burn, and
then turned to leave.</p>

<p>Reid, in the mean time, had been getting closer and
closer, and was now so near, that, but for the fact that
she had taken the precaution to cover her face, he could
have recognized her. But this was not to avail her long;
for, as she turned, one strong hand grasped her arm, and
another tore off the mask, and&mdash;Mrs. Granger stood
revealed.</p>

<p>She paled to the hue of death; but her self-possession
did not forsake her, and the next instant the flash of steel
was seen.</p>

<p>"Devil!" exclaimed Reid, as he seized the uplifted

<!-- page 95 -->

hand in time to arrest the blow. "Devil! what do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"Fool! what do you mean?" she hissed between her
set teeth. "What do you mean, coming here on a
midnight assignation with a woman whose mother is
hardly cold in the grave? Shame, shame!"</p>

<p>"The insinuation is worthy of one who comes here
with arson and murder in her heart. Look there!" said
he, crushing with his foot the fast-kindling blaze.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" she laughed; "wouldn't it have been
nice to have smoked you out, like rats from a hole? A
good blaze here, and then a wet blanket to smother it,
and shut in all the smoke, only what could have passed
into the house through the cat and key holes."</p>

<p>Reid was dumb with amazement at such cool assurance;
while she continued, "Oh! I wish I had only
been a little quicker, and then had the whole town here
to have witnessed the sport. I think the warmth of
their charity would have abated somewhat, notwithstanding
the Rev. Mr. Gordon's eloquence."</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" said Helen, coming to the
door; for the noise had awakened her, and she had arisen
to ascertain the cause.</p>

<p>"It means," said Mrs. Granger, "that you are
caught, notwithstanding your slyness. A pretty time this
to receive midnight visits from gentlemen! But for the
fact that your mother was no better than yourself, she
would rise from her grave to reproach you."</p>

<p>"And how came you here at this hour, madam?"</p>

<p>"I came to watch you, you shameless creature; and I
have learned what I wished to know." Reid still held
her by the arm, and Helen looked inquiringly at him.</p>

<!-- page 96 -->

<p>He pointed to the smothered flame. "If I believed
that spirits revisited the earth," said he, "I should certainly
think that your mother had come from the grave
to protect instead of reproaching you; for I was wakened
from my sleep, and brought here, by some power beyond
myself."</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Granger gave a sudden wrench, and, thus
freeing herself, started swiftly toward town. Reid followed,
and was soon so far in advance as to turn and
intercept her.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she demanded. "Do you
wish to murder me?"</p>

<p>"It sounds well for you to talk of being murdered,
madam,&mdash;don't it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know why else you should be following
me."</p>

<p>"I demand to know what further wickedness you
are intent upon; and I swear to you, madam, that, if
you dare to utter your accursed falsehoods further than
you have already done, it will be the worse for you."</p>

<p>"Do you threaten me, sir? Recollect that I have a
husband to protect me."</p>

"And so has Miss Harlow one who will protect her
with his life, if necessary,&mdash;one who would be only
too glad to be her husband, if she would consent. And
as to your husband, I should laugh to see you influencing
him against her."</p>

<p>This last remark was more just than wise; or so he
thought when he saw its effect upon the desperate
woman before him: but perhaps it was as well in the
end.</p>

<p>She evidently felt its force, and, for several moments,

<!-- page 97 -->

was nearly choking with rage. She waited, however,
till she could speak calmly, and then said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I see, Mr. Reid, what you wish. You think to
frighten me into silence; but I am not to be influenced
by fear. I have some regard, however, for my husband's
feelings; and I should grieve to have him know
what a wretch he has for a friend. On his account, I
will promise to keep silence as long as you do."</p>

<p>"Fiend!" said Reid, stepping aside, "fiend, go!"</p>

<p>She hurried forward, and he followed, determined not
to lose sight of her till sure that she was where she
could do no more mischief that night. After seeing
her safe within doors, he watched till the morning
broke, to be certain that she did not leave again; and
then went back to his room, and slept till far into the
forenoon. When he arose, the stage for Albright had
been gone more than an hour. It was then that he
learned of the message that had been left the night
before, and knew that it was done on purpose to learn
if he was there or with Helen.</p>

<p>"She will keep silence so long as I do!" said he;
repeating Mrs. Granger's words of the night before.
"She evidently fears me, though determined not to show
it; and, consequently, will keep her promise. But I
shall tell Granger all about this, that he may help to
watch the fiend, and keep her from doing Helen harm.
My God! I wish she would consent to marry me, and
let me take her away from this accursed place."</p>

<p>At first he felt inclined to make the whole story
public. When he thought of the singular manner in
which he came to be there, in connection with the
prejudice against Helen, he knew that his story would

<!-- page 98 -->

be questioned, to say the least. "I could not believe
it, if I did not know it to be true," said he to himself.
So, on the whole, he concluded to keep quiet, and watch
for further developments.</p>

<p>He visited Helen again, however, talked the matter
over, and renewed his offer of marriage.</p>

<p>She smiled in spite of herself. "Have you so mistaken
me, Mr. Reid," said she, "as to suppose that a
thing of this kind could influence or change my determination?"</p>

<p>"I might have known better," he replied; "for you
are different from any woman I have ever met. But
there is one thing you can not do: you can not prevent
my watching over you; and rest assured that I
shall make it the business of my life."</p>

<p>"While I can but appreciate the feeling, Mr. Reid,
I must say that I think you could find a more worthy
object to live for," was her tearful reply; for his devotion
moved her more strongly than she was willing to
acknowledge.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="small">MORE REAPING.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p class="small">"Darest thou to do the wrong? Then, when thou least art looking, shall the
judgment of that wrong overtake thy lagging steps."&mdash;L. W.</p>

<br/>

<p>MRS. GRANGER went back to her home,
and kept the silence she had promised;
not because she wished, but because she
could not speak the lie her heart conceived,
without touching her idol,&mdash;family
pride.</p>

<p>Helen sold her little home, and went into Lakeside
to live; partly because she felt more safe there than
so far away from others, and partly because she thought
it best to bend a little to the prejudices of the people.</p>

<p>In the village, her incomings and outgoings would
be open to all; and, further, she would necessarily be
brought more into such contact as would tend to wear
away the reserve which she had very naturally acquired
from a constant sense of her position.</p>

<p>This reserve tended more to beget distrust than confidence;
and, feeling the force of the remarks of the
minister on the day of her mother's funeral, she resolved
to break through it,&mdash;to do her part, at least,
toward removing prejudice from the public mind.</p>

<p>Consequently, she opened a fancy-store,&mdash;no very

<!-- page 100 -->

large establishment; one that was simply calculated to
meet the wants of a country village. But it was a business,
which, while it did not call gentlemen about her,
showed that she desired to win the confidence of her
own sex. She next sat down and wrote a plain,
straightforward letter addressed to the public, had
about fifty copies printed, and gave them to the ladies
of the place as she had opportunity.</p>

<p>In this letter she appealed to their better feelings as
women; told them that she had been misunderstood;
that her position in reference to the past was, that, so far
as the sin, the moral obliquity, of the act was concerned,
it did not truly belong to her.</p>

<p>"The weakness, the folly of trusting," said she, "is
mine, and I accept the suffering that it <i>naturally</i> brings;
for if you suppose for a moment, that, even with kindness
and sympathy, to say nothing of the bitter scorn
that is <i>unjustly</i> poured upon the head of foolishly trusting
girlhood,&mdash;if you imagine, even without the scorn,
that it is a pleasant thing to be a mother with no father's
hand to caress or father's loving eyes to smile upon your
darling, you are very much mistaken.</p>

<p>"Nay; this heart-hunger is so keen as at times to
make the sufferer almost indifferent to either smiles or
frowns from other sources. No, no, friends; I meditated
no wrong, for I meditated not at all. I only loved, nay,
worshiped, an idol; and how could I worship, and
suppose that the worshiped one would counsel me
wrong? Therefore, I say, the folly, the weakness, of a
child (I was but a child) were mine; but the <i>sin</i> belongs
to another, and I never will accept it.</p>

<p>"In that hour when I learned that my idol was false,

<!-- page 101 -->

I woke to womanhood; and, in the strength of that womanhood,
I vowed that I would not sink, that I would
rise, that the world should yet learn to do me justice.
And now,&mdash;mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters of
Lakeside,&mdash;will you aid me, by your confidence and your
patronage, to support myself and child honorably? or will
you turn away, thus planting thorns in my path?</p>

<p>"You ask, 'Why do I not give up the name of my
betrayer to public scorn?' It would do no good. <i>He</i> is
a <i>man</i>,&mdash;<i>a strong, self-sustaining man;</i> therefore the
world would not reject <i>him</i>. He now has a wife; and
why make her unhappy? No: leave him alone to the
stings of his own conscience, and to the exactions of
violated law. I am better off than he is. I have counseled
no wrong, betrayed no trusting heart, broken no
solemn vows; and unless God's justice is a farce, but
another name for wrong, I repeat it, I am better off than
he is."</p>

<p>This, of course, was variously received; but, on the
whole, it did good. Mr. Reid's business led him to
the place frequently, and he always spoke of Helen in
terms of the highest respect; declaring boldly that she
had refused him, together with the reasons why. Mr.
Gordon and his wife, from Glencove, always called upon
her whenever they came into the place; and, altogether,
the people began to think, that perhaps it wouldn't hurt
them to look at her goods. Helen had good taste; and
her selections were so well made, that, looking, they
were pretty sure to purchase.</p>

<p>So, step by step, her rooms became quite a place of resort;
though, through all, she so carried herself, that
those who approached her well understood that she respected

<!-- page 102 -->

herself; that she made no concessions, nor asked
none, on account of the past.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Reid had informed Granger of the
steps taken by his wife when at Lakeside; and, between
the two, they kept so good a watch upon her that she
dared not make another move, for the time at least,
though she watched and waited.</p>

<p>Some four years had passed since the death of Mrs.
Harlow, when Granger was agreeably surprised by a
visit from an uncle&mdash;his mother's only brother&mdash;from
Maine. This uncle was none other than the Hon.
Charles Edson, Helen's father; though of this fact
Granger knew nothing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger was in her element. "Mr. Granger's
uncle, the Hon. Mr. Edson from Maine," was the standing
topic of conversation: friends were invited, and
there was a grand time generally.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant was about the only one in Lakeside who
had not given up persecuting Helen. She said that
when people were penitent, it was time enough to forgive
them; it was all that was required of any one: and, for
her part, she thought the way that even those who call
themselves Christians were encouraging that girl was
a warrant for sin; and she shouldn't be surprised if it
came home to them some day, in the persons of their
own daughters.</p>

<p>Feeling thus, she of course sympathized with Mrs.
Granger, and whenever she came to Albright, which
was twice or three times a year, was well received.
Still, she was not exactly such a person as Mrs. Granger
wished to introduce to her best company; consequently,
she felt somewhat annoyed to have an extra

<!-- page 103 -->

visit at this time. But it could not be helped; so Mrs.
Grant also had the high privilege of making the acquaintance
of an honorable.</p>

<p>With her prying disposition, she was certain to recollect
every circumstance that ministered to this propensity.
She learned, before Mr. Edson came in, that he
was from Ross Cove, Maine; for Mrs. Granger, in an indirect
way, was trying to prepare her for the ordeal by
giving her to understand that the honorable gentleman
was very dignified,&mdash;indeed, that she felt quite in awe of
him herself: and, in doing this, she, of course, mentioned
his place of residence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant recollected that it was the same place from
which the letters came and were sent to, that had
puzzled her so much; so she resolved to find out something
more about the matter. When Mr. Edson came
in, she detected the resemblance between him and
Helen immediately. Here was food for her curiosity;
and she was sure to follow up the line that was thus put
into her possession.</p>

<p>"Mr. Edson," said she, as soon as she could with
half a show of decency approach the subject,&mdash;"Mr.
Edson, did you ever know any one in your place by the
name of Harlow?"</p>

<p>"There is a widow lady there by that name, madam."</p>

<p>"There was a Mrs. Harlow who used to live near
Lakeside; and her daughter has named her boy Edson,&mdash;Charles
Edson; and I thought you might be a former
acquaintance of the old lady's, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed! and do you know the lady's maiden
name?"</p>

<!-- page 104 -->

<p>"Harlow: she told me that she did not change her
name in marrying."</p>

<p>"Do you know where she resided before she came
here?"</p>

<p>"I do not, sir,&mdash;that is, not positively: somewhere
in Maine, I believe."</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Granger interposed. "It is nothing
strange, Mrs. Grant, for a gentleman in Mr. Edson's
position to have children named after him. There
was mother's cousin, Albion Field,&mdash;Gov. Field of
Maine. I have heard her say, that, during his term
of office, he was very popular with the people,&mdash;Cousin
Field was; and, during his term of office, there were, at
the least, a hundred boys named for him. Indeed, I
should not be surprised, if the truth was known, if
there were twice that number; for you can hardly go
into a neighborhood in the State but you will find an
Albion F.,&mdash;perhaps two or three of them."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mrs. Grant: "I do not doubt it in
the least. Every one of my boys is named for a president
or some great general,&mdash;Washington, Madison,
Monroe, Lafayette. The last was a Frenchman, and
I don't like the French very well; but then he was so
good a man, and the friend of Washington too."</p>

<p>"How many boys have you, madam?" asked Mr.
Edson, smiling.</p>

<p>"Only four, sir; and I never give my children two
names. I don't believe in such nonsense; but I sometimes
think it would have been more Christian-like if
I had given some of them Bible-names. But what I
wanted to say was, I could not have named my boys
after those great men, if I had never heard of them;

<!-- page 105 -->

and so Helen Harlow must have heard of you in some
way, or she could not have named her boy for you:
and, as she was brought up here, I thought her mother
might have known you some time."</p>

<p>Mr. Granger and his wife were terribly annoyed,
though they tried to conceal it from Mr. Edson; while
the latter, at the mention of the name Helen, started,
changed color, and then, smiling to hide his emotion,
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Really, I think I must see this lady who has named
her boy for me; I may find an old acquaintance."</p>

<p>Granger tried to change the subject by proposing
music; but Mrs. Grant would not be put off. She continued
talking of Mrs. Harlow,&mdash;the time she came to
Lakeside, the circumstances connected therewith, &amp;c.,&mdash;till
Mr. Edson began to suspect who it was: and then
he questioned further, till Mrs. Granger began to wonder
at it; and Mrs. Grant, elated at having interested
the gentleman, talked faster than ever.</p>

<p>The next day, Mr. Granger was surprised by a
request from his uncle to visit Lakeside with him. "I
believe," said he, "that this Mrs. Harlow is an old
acquaintance of mine, though I have never known her
by that name."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Harlow is dead," said Granger.</p>

<p>"But her daughter,&mdash;the one who has named her
boy for me."</p>

"Is an unmarried woman, and a mother. You do
not wish to seek such an acquaintance?"</p>

<p>"Not married!" he gasped.</p>

<p>Granger looked up, and saw that his uncle was as pale
as death. "What is the matter?" he asked in alarm.</p>

<!-- page 106 -->

<p>"The mother dead, and the daughter ruined!" he
continued, without heeding the question; and then,
looking up, and seeing Granger's expression of astonishment,
he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I see, Edward, that I must make you my confidant.
Yes: I am satisfied that they are the same; and,
if so, Helen Harlow is my own child. Her mother was
a schoolmate of mine. We grew up together, and&mdash;
and I&mdash;I betrayed and forsook her."</p>

<p>"My God, uncle! and is this true?" exclaimed
Granger, starting to his feet.</p>

<p>Mr. Edson, mistaken as to the cause of his nephew's
emotion, continued: "I know it: it was a dastardly
act,&mdash;one that, the longer I live, the more I regret.
But for Helen, I should feel even worse than I do
about it. It haunted me continually,&mdash;the memory of
it: I tried to put it aside by joining the church; and,
for a time, I did flatter myself that the ghost was laid.
Indeed, I was becoming hard, self-righteous; when, all
unexpected, Helen came upon me, and demanded a
thousand dollars as the price of her silence. She did
not wish to injure me,&mdash;the brave girl! but it was
her right, and she would have it. She got it too: and,
though not willingly given, after it was done I felt the
better for it, have ever since; for it seemed as if I
had in part compensated for the wrong. My wife died
about a year since; and I came out here hoping to find
Mary, and, if she was free, to marry her if she would
have me. Too late, too late! she is dead, and my
daughter, my only daughter, disgraced!"</p>

<p>Granger groaned aloud. He had hoped that his
uncle was mistaken; but the mention of that visit east

<!-- page 107 -->

put it beyond the possibility of doubt that Helen Harlow
was his own cousin.</p>

<p>Mr. Edson began to think that there was some cause,
further than he had supposed, for Mr. Granger's manifestation
of feeling; so he waited in silence for the next
remark. "Uncle," said he, at length, "I am the wretch
who seduced your child."</p>

<p>"You!" said he, recoiling as if from a serpent,
while his eyes flashed fire. For one moment he was the
outraged, angry father; and the next, the memory of his
own sin sweeping over him, he sank into the nearest
seat, and, burying his face in his hands, neither spoke
nor moved for several minutes.</p>

<p>At length he looked up, and said, "My boy, I pity
and forgive you; for, though the world may pass a
different judgment, by just so much as the betrayer is
guiltier than the betrayed, by so much must you suffer
more than she."</p>

<p>"I believe it, uncle. Still, society, by apologizing
for us, and condemning the woman, really tempts us to
sin."</p>

"Yes: society condemns and pities one party; but it
has but little condemnation and less pity&mdash;I might say no
pity&mdash;for the other party. The more I think about these
things, the more it looks to me like practical atheism,&mdash;a
total ignoring of God's laws, as inherent in his works.
It recognizes only that which it perceives, or, in other
words, only that punishment which it inflicts."</p>

<p>"So it seems to me," said Granger. "Still, I am no
metaphysician, and do not claim to be a judge in these
matters: I only know that I <i>suffer</i>. Oh! if I had only
married Helen, how much happier I should be to-day!"</p>

<!-- page 108 -->

<p>"But how are these things to be remedied, Edward?"</p>

<p>"I know of no other way than to make man feel
that he must be the greatest sufferer. We are selfish
beings; and I sometimes think that it is the only channel
through which we can be reached,&mdash;self-love."</p>

<p>"But we are told that we must ignore self, to be
good."</p>

<p>"I can't help it if we are; we can not do it; and,
if we look closely, we shall find that we are told many
things which will not stand the test."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we are right; in fact, I know that you
are: but I must go to Lakeside, and see Helen. Will
you go with me?"</p>

<p>"No, I can not. I have not seen her since before I
married Mrs. Granger; have never seen my boy,
neither do I deserve to. Still, I should like to have one
good look into his eyes, one kiss from his innocent
lips."</p>

<p>"Well, go with me then. I am sure there is nothing
wrong in your going to Lakeside with me. People
know the child is yours, of course."</p>

<p>"No: she has never told; and I was so villainously
sly, that people did not even suspect I was more to her
than any one else."</p>

<p>"Strange."</p>

<p>"She is a remarkable woman, uncle, though she was
but an innocent child when I first met her,&mdash;but
seventeen, not hardly that, when her child was born."</p>

<p>"One ought to be a woman at seventeen."</p>

<p>"And we are hardly called men at twenty-one. I
was twenty-four when I met Helen; she less than sixteen.

<!-- page 109 -->

Woman is counted as the weaker vessel; yet, at
an age when we are looked upon as mere boys, she is
expected to stand firm against all our flattery, our
sophistry, our promises, our strongest oaths: she is
expected to stand firm against all this, or she is
condemned, cast aside, perhaps crushed into a life of
infamy."</p>

<p>"I know that what you say is true, Edward,&mdash;know
that man claims the right to test a woman thus, and
society accords it. Not directly, in so many words, but
just as really; for, unless the circumstances are peculiarly
aggravated, the frowns we receive from woman
are like those that a partial mother gives to a
child. Pleased with his smartness, and yet feeling that
it will not do to openly approve, she frowns in such a
manner that the stimulus to perseverance is even
greater than that of smiles."</p>

<p>"And there is just where we are wronged, uncle.
Why, I have heard young men, even church-members,
boast that it was their right to take all that they could
win in this direction. I have two now in my mind,&mdash;Asa
and Henry Sidell,&mdash;who used openly to say this.
Still, they were leading church-members, generally first
in the prayer-meeting and other meetings. The girls
of the neighborhood knew this, but they never refused
their company.*</p>

<p class="small">[*This may be looked upon as an extreme case; but it is a fact, and but one
out of the many that I might give.]</p>

<p>"Yes; and there was a case in our neighborhood,
where a physician was waiting upon a young lady,&mdash;one
of the first in the place: her father was in the State
Legislature at the time of her death, as representative

<!-- page 110 -->

from his district, and had filled that office year after
year. Well, he used all his powers of persuasion,
threatening to forsake her if she did not yield, and
all without success. Finally he left her, and went to
waiting upon another lady; and this so affected her
that she took poison,&mdash;thus practically accepting his
<i>right</i> to test her, and so loving him through all, that she
chose to die rather than to live without him."*</p>

<p class="small">[*Another fact.]</p>

<p>"The same one that I have heard mother tell of,
Uncle Charles; and she said that Dr. Rhonell always
acted, after that, as though haunted by Statia Jenning's
ghost."</p>

<p>"True; and the balance of his life was one of intense
wretchedness,&mdash;another instance of the wrong done to
man, as well as to woman, by these mistaken ideas.
But about going to Lakeside; if people do not know
who the father of Helen's child is, I can't see what
there is to hinder."</p>

<p>"My wife knows."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"Yes; she has found it out. And, though her pride
will keep her from telling others, would cause her to
repel such a supposition even, still, she hates Helen so
badly, that I sometimes fear she will be the death of
her yet; and, when we are alone, she does not spare
me, you may be sure. You can form some idea now
of my domestic bliss. It is deserved, I know; but
I sometimes feel that my punishment is greater than I
can bear."</p>

<p>"But how did Mrs. Granger learn this?"</p>

<p>"They say that I gave her the clew in my sleep;

<!-- page 111 -->

and she has followed it up, till she knows as well as
we know any thing that we can not make oath to.
She has been to Lakeside, has seen Helen and the
child, and, in company with others, so frightened poor
Mrs. Harlow, that it was, no doubt, the means of
her death."</p>

<p>"I can't see why she should trouble Mary."</p>

<p>"The intention was to drive Helen out of the place.
But it was a failure; and the death of her mother, together
with other things, so changed the tide of popular
opinion, that she is now respected in spite of the
chances against her."</p>

<p>"How old is her boy?"</p>

<p>"Six years; yes, nearly seven."</p>

<p>"The little puss!" said Mr. Edson, smiling, in spite
of himself, at the recollection of the time in which she
tortured his Judgeship so effectually. "The little
puss! no wonder she was determined to have her thousand
when she came to Ross Cove! But I little supposed
that she had a mother's love to urge her on.
Her boy was over two years old then."</p>

<p>"It was soon after her return that Mrs. Harlow
died, and Helen moved to the village. The very charitable
people of that place, because she would not explain
to them her business, tell them where she had been,
and why,&mdash;because of this, they imagined the very
worst things possible, and went farther than they would
have done at any other time."</p>

<p>"Well, I shall go and see Helen, at all events; and,
if I could do so without compromising her mother,
would acknowledge her before the world."</p>

Me., standing before her.</p>

<p>For one brief moment her self-possession
forsook her. The blood flooded her face, and then,
receding, left her as pale as a living person can well
be; then, summoning back her proper self, she replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is, sir. In what can I serve you?"</p>

<p>"Helen, my child!" said he, extending his hand.</p>

<p>She responded by a startled "Hush!" but it was
too late; for the quiet assistant who stood just beyond
the range of the judge's eye had heard all; and, before
night, it was known all over Lakeside that Helen Harlow's
father had come to see her. Of course, there was

<!-- page 113 -->

a sensation; and "Like mother, like daughter" was
echoed by many a lip.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant had just returned; but she was so
elated by the discovery,&mdash;so elated because it confirmed
her previous suspicions,&mdash;that she could not
trust to sending a letter, but must needs go right back
to Albright, and tell her "very dear friend," Mrs.
Granger, what she had learned.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" exclaimed that lady, holding up both
hands in astonishment.</p>

<p>"It is not only possible, but true, my dear friend;
for 'Mandy Smith ('Mandy assists Helen, sometimes,
when business is brisk; though I can't see, for my
part, how any mother can let a daughter go there, and
I told Mrs. Smith so only yesterday)&mdash;well, 'Mandy

know&mdash;nobody in Lakeside&mdash;who it was; but I had
seen him here, and told them. Well, as I was saying,
'Mandy was standing just out of sight when he came
in; and says he, 'Helen, my child!' but she looked
scared like, and says she, 'Hush!' "</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense, Mrs. Grant! it don't follow, from
that, that he is her father. Elderly gentlemen often
say 'my child' to those who are not even relatives.
It is a common thing; and then his position, you know,
gives him the right to feel a fatherly interest in those
who have come from the same State. A gentleman of
his standing, Mrs. Grant, from one of the best families
in the State, a Christian mother, and a Christian himself,&mdash;the
idea is preposterous, that he should claim
such as her as his child!"</p>

<!-- page 114 -->

<p>"O Mrs. Granger! you are so innocent, know so
little of the ways of the world! Such things don't
hurt a man. It is a little uncommon, I know, for
them to own such children; but then his position is
such that I suppose he feels sort of independent, and
can afford to do what we common people could not
think of doing."</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger winced to have her own arguments
turned against her so adroitly, and was proceeding to
deny further, when she was interrupted with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I tell you it is so, Mrs. Granger; for he don't deny
it. The Rev. Mr. Gordon was in town yesterday,&mdash;the
one, you know, who preached Mrs. Harlow's funeral-sermon;
any thing but a Christian, I call him, from
the course he is taking. And betwixt you and me,
Mrs. Granger, though I wouldn't like to say it to every
one,&mdash;but I don't believe he takes Helen's part as he
does for nothing: ministers are not always better than
other people, you know. Well, as I was saying, this
Maine man told Mr. Gordon that it was almost the only
thing he had ever done which he really regretted,&mdash;his
treatment of Helen's mother."</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger could dispute the point no longer, of
course; but she wished the "dear friend" had been
almost anywhere else but at her house when Uncle
Edson came, while Mrs. Grant continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Helen is the very image of him. I saw that as
soon as I looked at him; and this, with the fact that
her boy is named for him, decided the question in my
mind then, as to the relation they sustained to each
other. I tell you, Mrs. Granger, there is not much
that escapes my notice."</p>

<!-- page 115 -->

<p>"I should think as much!" snapped Mrs. Granger.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant, however, was too intent upon her own
merits to notice the tone in which these words were
uttered. But it is time that we returned to Lakeside.</p>

<p>How those two words "My child!" thrilled through
the soul of the poor girl who had never known a
father's love! And, but for the fact that the knowledge
thus unintentionally given to the public would
bring a stain upon her mother's memory, she could
have yielded to the delicious thrill which was thus sent
through her soul.</p>

<p>As it was, she turned calmly to her assistant, and
said, "I will finish the work you have in hand, Miss
Smith; and you can go to Mrs. Miller's, and get your
new dress fitted."</p>

<p>Now, "Miss Smith" would much rather have staid
there at that particular time; though, half an hour
before, she thought, that, if Miss Harlow would only
spare her to have the dress fitted that day, why, she
could have it to wear the next Sunday,&mdash;a very desirable
thing, as every one of her six good dresses had
been worn at least a dozen times each; and one gets
tired, you know, of seeing the same old things so
long.</p>

<p>However, there was that in Helen's manner that
admitted of no appeal; so, without a word, she laid
aside the work referred to, took the material for the
new dress, and repaired to the dressmaker's.</p>

<p>When she was out of hearing, Helen turned to her
father and said, "Mr. Edson, was it not enough that
my mother's life was blighted by you, that you must
come here to cast your shadow upon her grave?"</p>

<!-- page 116 -->

<p>"O Helen, my child!" Here Helen cast a glance
toward her boy. "Yes, I know that too, and"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Charlie, come and kiss mother, and then go and
play with your marbles, out in the back yard."</p>

<p>The child sprang into his mother's arms, and was
held close in a passionate embrace; then, as he turned
to go, the judge said, "And will not Charlie kiss me
too?"</p>

<p>He looked at his mother, and shrank back. "He is
timid with strangers," she said; then, answering the
look,&mdash;"never mind, darling; run along." He would
have kissed the stranger, notwithstanding, had she but
smiled; and she knew it: but she felt that she could
not bear it; and so she sent him away.</p>

<p>"Helen, my child, I did not come here to make you
trouble. I had hoped to find your mother living; and,
as my wife has been dead these two years, to induce her
to marry me, if possible, that I could indeed be a
father to you."</p>

<p>Helen shook her head, while Mr. Edson continued:
"I know that it is too late, so far as she is concerned;
but you&mdash;I have told my boys the story, and they
wait to welcome you as a sister."</p>

<p>"Would they welcome me with my child?" she
asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Edson's countenance fell. "Perhaps that would
not be so easy; still, it might be remedied,&mdash;even this
objection; for I did not tell them your name,&mdash;the
name your mother bore. I did not know it myself.
You can still be called Harlow, and pass as a widow."</p>

<p>"Yes; and be asked, again and yet again, the cause
of my husband's death, where he was born, where his
relatives are, &amp;c. No; that would never do."</p>

<!-- page 117 -->

<p>"I don't see why you could not do it for the sake of
your child, as your mother did for hers."</p>

<p>"My mother's ideas and mine may be somewhat
different, sir; but, so far as that is concerned, I should
not go, were it otherwise than it is. I could hardly
trust myself with one who has once shown himself so
utterly unworthy of confidence."</p>

<p>"O Helen!"</p>

<p>"How did you learn," she continued, without heeding
his deprecatory words,&mdash;"how did you learn that
I was a mother and not a wife? You said that you
knew."</p>

<p>"From the child's father."</p>

<p>She looked up in amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes, and you will be still more surprised when I
tell you&mdash;what he did not know till recently&mdash;that
he is your own cousin."</p>

<p>"My cousin!"</p>

<p>"Yes: your cousin,&mdash;my own sister's child. I have
just come from his house; and I tell you, Helen, that
I would rather be in your place than his: you are the
happier of the two."</p>

<p>"Yes: poor Edward! he has made a sad mistake,"
she murmured.</p>

<p>" 'Poor Edward!' I see, my child, that you pity him,
notwithstanding the wrong he has done you; and still,
you will make no allowance for me. I have suffered
too. Nay, I very much doubt if my life has been as
happy as your mother's was,&mdash;not half as happy as it
would have been with her."</p>

<p>Helen arose to her feet. "Leave me," said she;
"for I can not bear more now."</p>

<!-- page 118 -->

<p>He arose also, and stood, with hat in hand, looking
at her entreatingly.</p>

<p>"Go!" she cried, throwing her hands in front of
her, with the palms turned toward him, as if she would
ward off even the sense of his presence: "go! I
can not trust you: it is selfishness that prompts you.
You want a daughter's love in your old age; but I can
not, I will not give it! Oh! why have you come here
to disturb the current of my life? to try to tempt me
from my life's work? Suffered, have you? It is
well. Suffer on; and some time, somewhere, in the
distant future, you may reach the point of expiation:
till then, go!" And, sinking into a seat, she burst into
one of those passionate fits of weeping that exhaust
rather than soothe.</p>

<p>Without another word, he turned and left her; but
he was no sooner out of sight, than her feelings changed,
and she accused herself of cruelty. Indeed, her course
toward him had been prompted more by the struggle
between the yearning for a father's love, and the certainty
that she could not carry out her life-purpose if
she accepted it, than from a spirit of unforgiving bitterness.</p>

<p>That same afternoon,&mdash;for events always seem to come
in clusters,&mdash;Reid came into the place, and, in passing
along the street, noticed groups of persons standing together
in earnest conversation. Coming close to one of
these before they perceived him, he heard Helen's name
mentioned.</p>

<p>"What is the matter now?" thought he; then, finding
that they hesitated when they saw him, he went
boldly up and asked what the excitement was.</p>

<!-- page 119 -->

<p>"Nothing," said one; "only Helen Harlow's father
is in town."</p>

<p>"Helen's father!" Then the conversation he had
heard that night by the lake flashed across his mind; and,
instead of saying, "I thought he was dead," he simply
added, "Where is he?"</p>

<p>"At the public-house," was the reply.</p>

<p>At first he thought he would go directly there; but,
after thinking over the matter, decided to see Helen
before he did so. She met him calmly, though her face
still showed traces of the recent storm.</p>

<p>"What is it, Helen?" he asked.</p>

<p>"My father is in town, and the sight of him has called
up feelings of no very pleasant nature; still, I shall survive,
I think," she replied with a smile.</p>

<p>"Survive! I should like to know what you wouldn't
survive! O Helen! why will you persist in stemming
the tide alone?"</p>

<p>"Hush! not another word. One is enough to contend
with in one day. And I don't feel like talking now; so,
if you wish to learn any thing more, go and find Mr.
Edson. He is at the public-house, I believe."</p>

<p>"Not the Hon. Mr. Edson, from Ross Cove,
Maine?"</p>

<p>"The same, sir."</p>

<p>"Edward Granger's uncle?"</p>

<p>"Edward Granger's uncle. But I thought you were
to ask me no more questions, Mr. Reid; at least, not
now."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. Miss Harlow. Good-afternoon."
But he was no sooner out of the house than the thought,
"Now she will believe that I am angry," induced him

<!-- page 120 -->

to turn back, for the purpose of showing her that he was
not.</p>

<p>"I thought you had gone," said she.</p>

<p>"And so I had; but feared I had not started right,
and so returned to make sure."</p>

<p>She read his thought. "I knew that you were not
angry; so you need not have turned back for that."</p>

<p>"Well, I will go along, then, and hope you will feel
better when I return."</p>

<p>"Which I hope will not be to-day," she said, looking
up with a defiant smile.</p>

<p>"Thank you: I will try not to offend." And again
she was alone; but she felt better already. Her conversation
with him had proved a diversion, gradually bringing
her back from the depth of feeling into which the visit
of her father had plunged her; so she had no need to
wait for his return ere his hope was realized.</p>

<p>Reid went to the public-house, and asked for Mr.
Edson; introduced himself as a friend of Mr. Granger's
of Albright, and was kindly received. After speaking
upon general topics a while, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Edson, you will excuse me if I seem impertinent:
but I have just learned a fact in which I feel much
interested; and I wish to have some conversation upon
the subject."</p>

<p>Mr. Edson looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>"I have known Miss Harlow, sir, for some time, and
respect her very much, and"&mdash;He paused, as if fearing
to offend.</p>

<p>"Go on," said the judge pleasantly.</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, he continued: "I have just learned
that you, sir, are her father; and permit me to say

<!-- page 121 -->

that she is one of whom any father ought to be proud,
notwithstanding appearances."</p>

<p>"You seem to be her friend, to say the least."</p>

<p>"I am, sir; I should be happy to make her my wife,
if she would consent."</p>

<p>"I think, from what I can see and hear, Mr. Reid,
that she is made of pretty stern stuff; and I wonder at
her being in the condition in which I find her."</p>

<p>"She has learned from bitter experience to be what
she is. Better so than to sink." And then Reid went
on to tell of the time that she had overheard the conversation
between him and Granger; of her vow at that
time,&mdash;a vow which she seemed determined to keep, no
matter how tempted to change her purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. Edson listened attentively. "That explains,"
said he, "some remarks she made this afternoon. I
couldn't understand what she meant, when, on offering
to take her home with me, and to recognize her as a
daughter, she asked me why I had come to tempt
her."</p>

<p>"She refused you, then?"</p>

<p>"Most decidedly; rejected my offers of love and protection
with scorn, and bade me leave her."</p>

<p>"She was suffering intensely, sir, or she would not
have done that. O sir! you have but little idea of what
she has had to endure." And then he proceeded to tell
of that other time in the rocks, when he had been concealed,
and had heard all that those women had said; of
what he found when he returned four weeks afterward;
and, lastly, of that night when he was awakened from
sleep, and so strangely impelled toward Helen's home.</p>

<p>"My God! what a demon!" exclaimed the astonished

<!-- page 122 -->

listener. "And she really would have burned them in
their sleep!"</p>

<p>"So it seems, though I could bring no proof but my
own assertion and, if I had told how I came to be there,
no one would have believed it, as she boldly accused
me of being there for the worst of purposes, and that
she had planned to smoke us out,&mdash;declared that she
wished that the whole village was there, as they would
not have so much charity for Helen then.</p>

<p>"Why, she even threatened to go and proclaim that
she had suspected all was not right, and had followed
me there on purpose to learn if her suspicions were
correct."</p>

<p>"And you allowed yourself to be frightened out in
that manner, Mr. Reid, by threats of a woman?"</p>

<p>"For the sake of one woman, Mr. Edson, I left
another to the punishment of her own reflections. I
wished to protect Helen as far as possible; and I did
not wish to stand before the community in such a light
that all I could do would have the opposite effect. I
knew that she had no intention of doing this unless I
forced her to it in self-defense; and so I decided to
watch and wait. I told Granger, however, so that he
could help me watch."</p>

<p>"Help you watch?"</p>

<p>"Yes; she has not given up her purpose of injuring
Helen, I can assure you."</p>

<p>"And I shall not leave her here without another
effort to induce her to go with me. Will you help me,
Mr. Reid, to persuade her."</p>

<p>"In the morning I will: I think we had better leave
her to her own thoughts to-night."</p>

<!-- page 123 -->

<p>"Poor Helen! she was but a woman, after all; and
how the woman nature pleaded for love and protection!
How she hungered for it! Ah! but she had trusted
once,&mdash;had trusted, and walked upon thorns ever since.
Should she accept protection now, and thus deprive
herself of even the poor privilege of showing that she
could walk thereon firmly? Why struggle thus proudly,
when a husband's love and a father's care were urged
upon her?"</p>

<p>But there was another voice which whispered, "It
is not for yourself alone: one successful effort in this
direction, one demonstration of woman's power to
endure and triumph, will put courage into the heart of
many a poor wronged girl, and keep her from sinking,
perhaps, to the deepest degradation." And thus
she struggled and reasoned all the night long. The
morning showed her pale, haggard even, but quietly
firm.</p>

<p>It was thus that her father and lover found her,
and knew, almost before speaking, what the result of
their efforts would be. Still, they proffered their requests,
and urged the proudly independent girl, with
all the eloquence that they could command, to change
her decision.</p>

<p>"I can not, I can not," was her constant reply.</p>

<p>"You mean you will not," said her father, losing
his patience at length.</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed. "Well, I will not, then. The
only way in which I have won this much, sir, is by
being true to myself; and I shall hardly change my
course now. Had it not been for my self-assertion,
neither you nor Mr. Reid would have put forth any
efforts in my behalf."</p>

<!-- page 124 -->

<p>"Helen!"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Reid: I do not wish to be unjust to you.
You have been a true friend; but it is because I have
been my own friend,&mdash;have been true to myself.
Had I consented to take the position that the world
unjustly assigns to such as I, you would never have
taken the interest in me that you have."</p>

<p>"You are right," he replied: "you have <i>commanded</i>
my respect."</p>

<p>"And I intend to continue to <i>command</i> it, sir; and
not for myself only, but for others. There are others,
and they are found everywhere, who are constantly
sinking out of sight, only because they have no faith
in the possibility of reaching solid ground; let such but
see that even one has done so, and they, too, will make
the effort."</p>

<p>"I see your position, Helen," said her father. "You
look upon yourself as a martyr to principle, and glory
in it."</p>

<p>"And as I will not have that glory taken from me,
you may as well cease your efforts in that direction,"
said she, with one of those smiles which so effectually
forbid further conversation.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p class="small">CRAZY JANE'S STORY.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<div class="small">

<p>"God winketh not at ignorance, but, by the action of unerring law, still urges
on to knowledge. The suffering caused by our mistakes is but the lash with
which our loving mother Nature scourges us laggards onward in the path which
leads to Wisdom's realm."&mdash;L. W.</p>

<p>"Get wisdom, and, with all thy gettings, get understanding."&mdash;BIBLE.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>AND who was Crazy Jane? A poor old
woman bent with age, who, with frosted
hair and tottering step, wandered at will;
a harmless creature of seventy years, who
muttered to herself by hours; and people
said that she was hopelessly insane.</p>

<p>Helen was somewhat surprised upon looking up one
morning, about a year after the above events, to see
this poor old creature standing in the door of her little
shop, regarding her very intently.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, mother. Have a seat?" said she,
pushing a chair toward the bent form.</p>

<p>"And is it mother that you call the poor old creature?
Blessings on the darling!" was the response, as she
took the proffered chair, still regarding Helen with the
same fixed gaze.</p>

<p>"What is it, mother? any thing I can do for you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing. You can do nothing for a poor

<!-- page 126 -->

old creature like me. No, no," still shaking her head;
"nothing for me. I was only looking to see what kind
of stuff you was made of, that you could still keep your
eye bright, and yourself clear of a double load all this
time."</p>

<p>"A double load?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, child; a double load. Many a poor
creature has taken a miserable scamp of a husband to
help them carry their load of shame, and found, to their
sorrow, that their last state was worse than the first;
that the cover to the shame was heavier than the shame
itself."</p>

<p>Helen smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes: and 'twas a brave thing that you did, my
child,&mdash;a brave, brave thing; and when I heard them
talking about it,&mdash;the old man and the young one,&mdash;somewhere
nigh on to a year since, I said, 'I will look
upon the face of the lass who could scorn the man who had
wronged her, and defy the world that would crush her.'
But poor old Jane was sick from the cold she took that
night sleeping under the stars; was sick for nearly a
twelvemonth: and they thought, hoped, that she would
die."</p>

<p>"But why did you sleep out of doors, mother?"</p>

<p>"And why did I sleep out of doors, do ye ask?"</p>

<p>"Yes: why did you do it, when there are so many
houses in this beautiful world? Surely, no one would
turn a poor old lady like yourself away from their
door."</p>

"Oh, but bless her tender heart! she is calling me a
lady,&mdash;me that was the wife of old Josh Morgan, and
the mother of a gallows-bird. A lady! ha, ha, ha!"

<!-- page 127 -->

and the poor, withered old creature rocked back and
forth with an hysterical laugh that presently changed
to a wild, wailing cry. "O Johnny! my poor boy!
you was not to blame that your mother planted the
seeds of murder in your heart before you saw the light
of this dark world. O Johnny, Johnny! my poor,
poor boy!"</p>

<p>Helen finally succeeded in soothing her; when, going
back to the question why she had slept out of doors, she
said, "I slept out of doors because the proud lady,&mdash;she
was a lady, you know,&mdash;she shut the door in my face;
telling me that her house was no place for such as me.
I was too tired to go further, and too sad to knock at
another door in that place,&mdash;Albright, they call it; but
it has been all dark to me.</p>

<p>"Yes: I was too tired to travel farther; and so, instead
of going out at the gate, I slipped around the garden
way, and, crawling under a broad bench, lay down
and went to sleep. When I waked, there were two men
sitting upon that very bench, talking of you; and when
the younger one had told the other your story, I said,
'And I will see the darling's face yet;' and here I am."</p>

<p>"And tired and hungry too, mother. Lie down here
on this lounge, and rest a little, while I tell Susan to
make you a good cup of tea."</p>

<p>The old lady's lip quivered. "Kind, kind! I might
have known it: the brave are always kind."</p>

<p>"No great credit to one who expects to be old herself
some day, and will want some one to take care of her
then," said Helen.</p>

<p>"Yes, and you will have the care too. When one is
brave enough to help themselves, all things help them.

<!-- page 128 -->

There's the bright little lad: he will care for the mother
who was too brave to give him another father when his
own would not own him. Come here, little one, and let
a poor bid woman put her hand upon your head and
bless you."</p>

<p>Charlie looked at his mother. "Yes; go and see the
good grandmother, my darling."</p>

<p>The child walked quietly up, and looked into the
old woman's face with a sort of wondering gaze; for he
was not accustomed to seeing very old people. Jane
regarded him intently for a moment; and then, sinking
upon her knees, she clasped her withered hands above
his head, and said, "O God of love, wisdom, and
power! bless this child, and make him an honest, truthful
man,&mdash;one who will say what he means, and mean
what he says. Amen."</p>

<p>"Amen," responded Helen.</p>

<p>"Yes: and you may well say amen; for, if he is that,
his words will deceive no poor maiden, to break her
heart. And now, when I have rested and eaten, I will
tell you what has made 'Crazy Jane' what she is;
that is, if you will listen to her story."</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly, mother, I will listen to your
story; but I don't believe you are as crazy as some people
think you are."</p>

<p>"Well, if I ain't, I ought to be; for it is hardly
polite to call people fools or liars. One ought to be
what he is called; for it makes the good folks mad if he,
or especially if she, is not. That is what makes some
folks hate you so, my bird. You won't be what they
say you are."</p>

<p>Jane said this in that peculiarly cunning manner

<!-- page 129 -->

which partially insane people so readily assume; and
Helen laughed heartily, in spite of herself.</p>

<p>"You may laugh, my bird, for you have earned the
right to laugh: but poor old Jane should never do any
thing but weep, and gnash her teeth, too, if she had
any; but, as it is, she must gum it till the judgment-day,
I suppose."</p>

<p>By this time she was ready to lie down, but made
Helen promise, first, that she would not let her sleep
more than half an hour. "For," said she, "I am so deaf
that I shall not hear Gabriel's trumpet, if you don't;
and I want to be at the judgment to tell God about my
boy, and what it was that made him so bad: and maybe
he will let me suffer for myself and Johnny too; and
then Johnny can go to heaven, you know."</p>

<p>At this manifestation of mother-love from the poor,
wrecked creature, Helen could hardly restrain her tears:
but she gave the required promise; and the weary head
was soon resting quietly upon a softer, cleaner pillow
than it had had for many a long day.</p>

<p>Helen put the clock back half an hour, giving her an
hour instead of half of one, and, when she awoke, had a
good dinner ready for her. This she ate in silence, and
then lay down and went to sleep again. When she
awoke the second time, rest and food had so far restored
her that she appeared quite rational. She did not talk
much, however, but seemed watching both Helen and
little Charlie with a quiet sort of interest, as though
she was taking notes, and forming an opinion of what
she saw and heard.</p>

<p>As the evening advanced, she manifested a little restlessness,

<!-- page 130 -->

and finally asked, "Will you shut up for the
night soon?"</p>

<p>"Presently," was the reply; and then, noticing the
anxious look upon the wrinkled face, Helen asked,
"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I wish to tell you the story of my life."</p>

<p>"I should like to hear your story, mother; but will
it not worry you too much to tell it to-night?"</p>

<p>"No: I must tell it to-night, or not at all."</p>

<p>This reply startled Helen. She looked at the poor
creature, and saw that she was perfectly sane; and,
recollecting that insane people sometimes recover their
reason just before they die, she hastened to close the
blinds and fasten the door, and then sat down to listen.</p>

<p>Jane cleared her throat once or twice; drew a long
breath, and then began:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is a sad story, Miss Harlow, that I have to tell
you: but it will do you good,&mdash;will strengthen you in
the path you have chosen, and therefore I tell it.</p>

<p>"To look at me now, one would hardly think that I
was ever beautiful; but I was. I was the oldest and
the idolized child of Wilson Ashton of &mdash;&mdash; County,
in this State. You look surprised, and well you may;
for the Ashtons are a proud family; but the Hon. R.
S. Ashton, of whom so much has been said, who is
so widely known and so highly respected, is my own
brother's son; though I will do him the justice to say
that he does not know of the relationship.</p>

<p>"When I was fifteen years of age, Henry Norcroft,&mdash;here
you start again, for the Norcrofts stand
as high in Vermont as do the Ashtons in this State,&mdash;I

<!-- page 131 -->

was fifteen, as I have said, when I first saw Henry
Norcroft. He was twenty, and my very beau ideal of
manly beauty; and, as he boarded with us while preparing
for college, we were, as a matter of course,
thrown much into each other's company.</p>

<p>"I do not think that Henry meant to be a villain: I
know that he did not. But led on, step by step, by an
attraction that neither seemed able to resist, little thinking
where we were drifting, we floated with the tide, till,
alas! it was too late, too late, to return.</p>

<p>"He loved me, and would have married me; but his
parents would not consent: they would disown him if
he did. They were ambitious for him, and his prospects
should not be blighted for the sake of such as I,
if they could prevent it. He was not strong enough to
contend against their opposition, and so I was left to perish:
yes, it would have been far better to have perished
by my own hand than to live as I have.</p>

<p>"My parents, when their pride was touched, seemed
to have lost all their love for me; and their only thought,
judging from their acts, was how they could dispose of
me without disgracing themselves. The public, as yet,
had not been made aware of my condition. True, a
few suspected it, but dared not speak of their suspicions;
but there was one, a man twice my age, and one from
whose keen eye nothing that he attempted to fathom
could be hidden.</p>

<p>"This man professed to feel a very great interest in
Henry, gained his confidence, and won our secret from
him, just as we were puzzling our brains over the
matter, not knowing what to do. He then informed
Henry's parents, and they sent for him to come home.

<!-- page 132 -->

Henry vowed that he would not leave me, and then his
father came for him. Then my parents learned the
terrible truth; and my father, in the first paroxysm of
his rage, ordered me from the house. Just here Mr.
Morgan stepped in to accomplish his ends. He knew,
that, under any other circumstances, it would have been
useless, and worse than useless, to speak of making me
his wife.</p>

<p>"But my father was rich, and would do any thing to
keep disgrace from his name; so this man Morgan told
him that he had loved me from the first hour he saw
me, but, feeling that I could never be his, had buried
his feelings in his own bosom. 'But now,' said he,
'if you will give her the portion designed for her, so
that I can have the means to make her comfortable,&mdash;I
am poor, through the villainy of others,&mdash;if you will
do this, I will marry her, and take her out of the
State.'</p>

"Of course, my father consented. I loathed the man,
and felt that I would as soon die as to marry him.
But I could not die, though I prayed for it; and the
only alternative was, Morgan or open disgrace and the
street. O Miss Harlow! could I have had but <i>one
example</i> before me of one who had braved disgrace, and
won respect at last,&mdash;could I have known that such a
thing was possible,&mdash;I would have dared all.</p>

<p>"But I did not even dream that it could be; for I
found in the first book that I ever read, these lines:&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'Man tarnishes his character, and brightens it
again; but if woman chance to swerve from the
strictest rules of virtue,&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 133 -->

<p class="small">'Ruin ensues, reproach and endless shame;<br/>

One false step for ever blasts her fame.<br/>

In vain the loss she may deplore,<br/>

In vain look back to what she was before:<br/>

She sets like stars that fall to rise no more;'</p>

<p>and every thing that I saw and heard confirmed the
dreadful sentence.</p>

<p>"So, like a martyr to the stake, I went to&mdash;I will
not call it my marriage, for it was not: it was a living
sacrifice upon the altar of respectability. We went out
of the State, as had been stipulated; and my parents hid
their aching hearts under the semblance of smiles, as
they talked of 'Jane's marriage with Mr. Morgan, a
rich bachelor from Massachusetts, and the trial of having
her go so far away from home.'</p>

<p>"They visited me once or twice a year for a while:
not so much because they wished to see me, as for the
sake of keeping up appearances; and, after my baby
died, I went home once. I did not wish to go; but Mr.
Morgan insisted, and I had to yield.</p>

<p>"He could act the gentleman if he chose; was not
bad looking, and was very attentive: and, as my old
friends gathered around to welcome me, they little
dreamed of the terrible secret that was hidden in my
bosom. But what mattered it that my heart was breaking,
that my life was an earthly hell, so that the family
credit was saved!</p>

<p>"Oh! could I have known that my baby would not
live, I would have defied them all. I wept passionately
when he was taken from me, for he was Henry's child;
but Mr. Morgan was glad of it, and he told me so.
'He shouldn't have to bring up other people's brats
now,' he said.</p>

<!-- page 134 -->

<p>"He was for ever telling me of his love, and especial
kindness in marrying me '<i>under the circumstances;</i>'
exacting a great deal of gratitude for so doing. When
I had lived with him about two years, another child was
born to me; but, from the first moment that I knew
that I must become a mother again, I felt an intense
desire to destroy it. I nearly killed myself two or
three times in my efforts to do so, but failed.</p>

<p>"When I came to look upon the little helpless form,
however, my feelings changed to tender pity, which, as
he grew older, ripened into love. His little cunning
ways,&mdash;how sweet they were! But I had sown, and I
must reap. As he grew older, he manifested an intense
desire to kill whatever was in his power. It seemed
the same feeling that I had had toward him before he
was born; and oh, how it grieved me!</p>

<p>"No one had ever told me that such effects could follow
from the cause I have named: but I felt that it
must be so; and when I found a dog, a cat, or a pig
dead, killed by my little Johnny, I used to feel that it
was I, instead of he, that had done the deed.</p>

<p>"I tried, in every way that I could possibly think of,
to educate him out of this trait of character; and the
harder I tried to benefit him, the more I loved him. I
had nothing else to love, and I made this one love idolatry.
How I wept and pleaded and prayed with him!
He loved me, poor child, but he could not help it. He
would lie to me: this trait he inherited from his father.</p>

<p>"I never loved Mr. Morgan; but, after I married
him, I tried to love him,&mdash;tried to be a good wife;
used to believe what he told me, until I was forced to
see that he was really untruthful. But it takes a great

<!-- page 135 -->

deal of evidence to make one believe what they do not
wish to be true; and it was not till the winter before
Johnny was born, that I became fully satisfied that I
could believe only what I knew to be true, when the
man who called me 'wife' told me any thing. And the
trait which annoyed me so much in the father seemed
a part of the very nature of my child."</p>

<p>Helen had listened attentively to this point, without
interrupting the narrative; but here the facts related
struck her so forcibly that she began to question.</p>

<p>"What reason have you, Mrs. Morgan, for thinking
this to be the cause of your son's doing as he did?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Because it is Nature's law that like should produce
like. But please don't call me Mrs. Morgan: any name
but that," was the quiet reply.</p>

<p>"But this is not the reason given by our religious
teachers. They tell us that such manifestations of
wickedness are the result of human depravity."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Harlow; but whence comes the depravity?
Not from the inmost soul, which is God's work;
for then it would not be human, but divine, depravity.
No: it comes from the body, the brain,&mdash;the channels
through which the soul acts. The depravity comes
from the human part of us, and, consequently, is essentially
human."</p>

<p>"Why, mother!" said Helen, surprised at the depth
of thought manifested in the old lady's words; "you
beat the preachers in explaining these things."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, if they had passed through the furnace
that I have, they would know better than to talk as
they now do,&mdash;some of them, at least," was the prompt
response.</p>

<!-- page 136 -->

<p>"But to my story. Mr. Morgan had wasted, in gambling
and drinking, all that my father had given him
for marrying me; and, as he had no hopes of getting
any thing more in that direction, he left me to seek another
wife and another fortune. I was glad of this,
and all the more so when I learned that he had a wife
and three children near Albany, N.Y. So you see
that I was not his wife, after all. But that made no
difference, you know, for I was <i>ruined anyhow;</i> and his
love of money saved the family reputation, as people
<i>thought</i> I was his wife.</p>

<p>I was only too glad to be left alone; for I could
work for my boy, and I fancied that I could cure him
of his bad habits if I had him all to myself. So, with
better courage than I had felt for years, I laid my plans
for taking care of myself and Johnny. I gathered
together what little I had, sold what I did not need,
and bought what I could with the avails, toward making
things easy for me in the profession I had chosen,&mdash;that
of washerwoman.</p>

<p>"Not a very genteel employment; but what had I
to do with gentility? My only object of care was my
boy. I chose this kind of work, also, because I could
keep him with me more, could teach him to assist me,
and thus obtain an influence over him, which I could
not otherwise do. I kept him away from school;
teaching him myself, and taking pride in seeing him
keep in advance of those who went to school all of the
time.</p>

<p>"In a word, I made him my inseparable companion;
week-days and Sundays we were always together. He
was quick to learn, recited longer lessons from the

<!-- page 137 -->

Bible than any scholar who went to the sabbath
school; and I felt amply rewarded for all my care
when I heard him spoken of as the smartest boy in the
place. When he was twelve years old, there was an
extensive revival in the village, and he was numbered
with the converts. Now, indeed, I was happy. Surely,
the grace of God was sufficient to keep him from
evil!</p>

<p>"His habit of untruthfulness seemed for a while
broken; and I am certain he meant to be good. But,
alas! natural tendencies were strong; and, before two
years had passed, I found him as untruthful as ever.
Still, even here he manifested a wonderful care as to
results: the same trait that his father exhibited so
successfully whenever he chose,&mdash;that of keeping his
real disposition hidden from those whose respect he
desired to win; and but few, except his unhappy
mother, suspected his real character.</p>

<p>"When he was sixteen, there was another remarkable
revival of religion in the place; and my John was
again brought under an influence which held him for
more than two years. If ever one tried to live a
Christian, I am certain that he did. I could see, that,
at times, the old feelings were struggling for the mastery;
but when I saw him conquer once, again, and
yet again, I felt strong in the hope that he would
eventually come off victor over all. I had faith to
believe it. I asked God, in the strength of that faith,
to make the thing hoped for a certainty; but, when I
felt the most certain that all was well, the barriers
gave way, and the long-pent-up tendency broke forth
with renewed violence.</p>

<!-- page 138 -->

"And not only this,&mdash;not only the tendency to
lying and cruelty,&mdash;but still another: that of theft. I
thought I must die, my agony was so great. 'My son,'
I exclaimed one day, after a more flagrant manifestation
than usual,&mdash;'my son, what makes you do so?'</p>

<p>" 'I don't know, mother,' he replied; and, throwing
his arms around me, he wept as if his heart would
break. Again there was an attempt at reformation,
and again I began to hope. Things went on in this
manner for a while longer: but my parents, in all these
years, knew nothing of my place of residence; for Mr.
Morgan, just before he forsook me, moved us into an
entirely new neighborhood, and I had maintained a
strict silence as to my whereabouts.</p>

<p>"But I must hasten with my story, or I shall not
have the strength to finish." There was such a look
of suffering upon the old lady's face as she said this,
that Helen begged her not to go on; but she only
shook her head. Resting her head in her hands for a
few moments, as if to gather strength for the final
effort, she resumed her story with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The climax came at last. Johnny had been away
from me more than usual for several weeks, till within
a few days; but, during those few days, he had been
unusually kind and attentive. That morning,&mdash;I shall
never forget it,&mdash;he had been reading a very amusing
story to me, and we were both laughing heartily over
it, when there was a rap at the door. He turned pale,
so pale that I noticed it, and wondered what it meant:
but he arose quietly, and opened the door; and, before
those standing there had time to speak, he said, 'Yes,
gentlemen, I am ready,' taking his hat at the same

<!-- page 139 -->

moment, and, turning to me, 'Mother, good-by;' and
then walked away with those that I knew to be officers
of justice.</p>

<p>"One of them made a move as if to confine him;
but he said in a tone not intended for my ear, 'Not
before my mother.' But I can not dwell upon the
events of that awful time, further than to say that there
had been a murder committed, and some of the money
known to have belonged to the murdered man had
been paid out by my unhappy boy. I learned where
the corpse was; for it was only on the night before, and
in the early evening, that the deed had been done.
By some irresistible fascination, I was drawn to the
place, and insisted upon seeing the face of the dead.
They tried to keep me away, but it was of no use.
But they little dreamed of the cause of the shriek that
burst from my lips when my request was granted:
they little thought that the man lying there had once
called me wife, that his murderer was his own son.</p>

<p>"Yes: it was even so, though none knew it but myself.
He had assumed another name, and was advertised
in the papers as William Wilson, with the request
that his relatives would come forward and claim his
effects; but no one ever came. Had they advertised
him as Joshua Morgan, the result might have been
different. I don't know, though, for I am not certain
that that was his true name.</p>

<p>"I retained my self-possession through the whole;
talked with my poor boy of the deed, and, with his
head lying on my bosom, he told me all. From the
first moment that he saw the murdered man, he said
that he had felt a desire to take his life; that the feeling

<!-- page 140 -->

had grown stronger each time they met, until it
seemed utterly impossible for him to do otherwise than
he had done. 'I didn't want his money, mother; I
felt no disposition to steal from him: and still I took
it,&mdash;what little he had,&mdash;and then went and paid it
out, a portion of it before I went home; changed a five-dollar-bill
to pay for the nice steak that we had for our
breakfast the next morning.'</p>

<p>"My God! what agony I suffered! How plainly I
saw it all,&mdash;the causes that had led to this terrible
result! They seemed traced upon my brain with a
pen of fire,&mdash;the hatred I had felt for this man, and
toward the child that must bear his name, the hunger,
the longing I had experienced for just such food,
and the frenzy of passion into which I had fallen
when he refused to get it for me, and, at the same
time, had held his money before my eyes, to show me
that it was not because he could not, but because he
would not purchase what I so much desired. I was so
enraged, that, if I had had the power, I could have
killed him as easily as if he had been a snake instead
of a human being.</p>

<p>"My unborn babe had been the recipient of that
feeling. The man had really been his own murderer;
for it was the very feeling he aroused in me which
nerved the hand that struck the blow. And, stranger
still, the very food in kind that he denied me then
was purchased by the money taken from his pocket by
the hand that murdered him; even as I would have
murdered him then, while the frenzy of rage was
upon me.</p>

<p>"I said that the man really murdered himself. In

<!-- page 141 -->

one sense, this was true; and, in another, it was I that
did the deed by the hand of my child. My poor boy!
he was the least guilty of the three, though human
law, human shortsightedness, piled the whole blame
upon his defenseless head; while the papers, far and
near, reiterated the story of his depravity.</p>

<p>"I did not tell my poor boy what I have told you.
I wish I had; for it might have been some consolation
to him to have known that his mother acquitted him of
blame. But I stood by him just as long as they would
let me,&mdash;was calm, outwardly, and loving to him
through all: but when the final tragedy was over, the
legal murder done, then my mind gave way; and from
that time to this, my life seems like one long, troubled
dream.</p>

<p>"And now you have my story, Miss Harlow. I
have told it, as I said, to strengthen you in the path
you have chosen. Better&mdash;oh, how much better!&mdash;it
would have been to have accepted public disgrace than
to do as I did. To escape the consequences of a weakness,
a folly, I plunged into crime: to escape the
name of being vile, I made myself, or permitted others
to make me, vile indeed; for what greater pollution is
there for woman than to take vows upon her lips from
which her heart rebels? to bear children to a man that
she hates?</p>

<p>"My story is done, and so will soon be my troubled
life; for this period of perfect saneness is the lamp sent
by pitying Heaven to light me from this dark earth.
But I am weary, and would sleep."</p>

<p>With tearful eyes, Helen prepared a couch for the
aged limbs, and then sat, wrapped in thought, till long

<!-- page 142 -->

after the midnight hour. Poor old Jane was sleeping
quietly when she retired; but the next morning, when
they went to awaken her, they found only the worn-out
body from which the spirit had fled.</p>

<p>Helen wept not more freely over her own mother
than she did over the remains of this lonely woman;
but now they were tears of joy instead of bitterness,&mdash;joy
that the tried spirit was at length free; and joy
that she had been true to herself, had not married
simply from a feeling of <i>respect</i>, and thus sacrificed her
<i>self-respect</i>.</p>

<p>It was soon rumored through town that "Crazy
Jane" was dead, had died at Helen Harlow's; and,
before noon, the town officers came to see about making
arrangements for a pauper's funeral. But Helen
quietly put them aside, and proceeded to make the
preparations necessary to a respectable burial.</p>

<p>"If you do this, Miss Harlow, you must do it on
your own responsibility: the town will pay no unnecessary
expense," said they.</p>

<p>"I will take the responsibility," she replied; and so
they left her to herself. She furnished coffin and
shroud,&mdash;the same as was furnished for her mother;
sent for the Rev. Mr. Gordon of Glencove to preach
the funeral-sermon, and had her buried by her mother's
side.</p>

<p>"A great deal of respect Helen Harlow shows her
mother's memory,&mdash;burying that old creature beside
her!" said Mrs. Grant to her next neighbor. And
others commented upon the fact as a piece of needless
folly; some going so far as to say that there must be
some cause for Helen's course in this matter, further

<!-- page 143 -->

than appeared upon the surface: and, for a while, it
was confidently believed that "Crazy Jane" was really
her grandmother.</p>

<p>Helen smiled when she heard this, and said that it
made but little difference what people thought. This
only made their tongues run the faster for a time; but
soon, like other nine-days' wonders, the matter ceased
to be talked of, and things settled back in their old
channel.</p>

<p>In spite of Mother Grundy alias <i>Mrs. Grant</i> and
her clique,&mdash;which, by the way, was not, in this case,
a very large one,&mdash;Helen's shop continued to be the
resort of the ladies of Lakeside; and Helen continued to
furnish them with what they needed in her line, and to
educate her boy, instead of sending him to the public
school, as people thought she ought to do. And when
a marble slab arose over poor Jane's grave, precisely
like the one at Mrs. Harlow's, with the simple inscription,
"He giveth his beloved sleep," people had so far
learned that Helen Harlow had her own way of doing
things, that there was but little said about it.</p>

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

<p class="small">THE WISDOM OF THE WISE.</p>

<br/>

<p class="small">"If the blind lead the blind, they shall both fall into the ditch."&mdash;BIBLE.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>SOME six weeks after Jane Morgan's
funeral, Helen received a visit from Mr.
Gordon and his good wife. This did not
surprise her, for they had been in the
habit of calling occasionally ever since
her mother's death.</p>

<p>But there was a look upon the reverend gentleman's
face that puzzled her somewhat, as he was so much
more staid and sober than usual.</p>

<p>"Miss Harlow," said he at length, "I feel that I
have not done my duty as I ought; and I owe it to you,
as well as to myself, to confess my remissness."</p>

<p>Helen looked up in surprise. "I can not imagine
what you mean, sir," she said: "you have always been
a true friend to me, and I have often felt that I hardly
knew how to be grateful enough for your kindness."</p>

<p>"And is there no point, my child, upon which you
have sometimes thought that I was remiss?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not any, sir."</p>

<p>"Have I ever spoken to you about the welfare of
your soul."</p>

<!-- page 145 -->

<p>"I believe that you have not; that is, not directly:
but your life&mdash;the course that you have pursued&mdash;has
spoken for you,&mdash;has done more to make me feel that
all did not put belief before life, profession before practice;
has done more to make me feel this than any
amount of preaching could have done. Why, sir, I
honestly think that I should have lost faith in humanity,
should have become a perfect misanthrope, had
it not been for Mrs. Gordon, Mr. Reid, and yourself."</p>

<p>"I am glad, Miss Harlow, that my life has had its
influence upon you; but, as a Christian minister, I feel
that I should have been more personal in this matter,
should have pressed upon your notice the importance
of becoming a true follower of Christ; and I wonder that
you have never thought upon it in this light."</p>

<p>"Why, sir, I realized that the matter of my soul's
interest lay between me and my God, and supposed
that you felt the same; that is, I should have supposed
so, if I had thought at all of your duty in this direction."</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon made no reply for some moments, but
looked at his wife with an expression of countenance
that seemed to say, "A new feature in the case: the
same independent originality here as elsewhere."</p>

<p>Finally he asked, "Do you think you are a Christian,
Helen?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by being a Christian?"</p>

<p>"Have you experienced that change of heart which
is necessary to becoming a child of God?"</p>

<p>"I can not say that I have, Mr. Gordon."</p>

<p>"And do you not know, that, without such a change,
there is no hope of happiness beyond the grave?"</p>

<!-- page 146 -->

<p>"I am no theologian, Mr. Gordon; but, with your
permission, I would like to ask you a few questions."</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly."</p>

<p>"Have I a right to find fault with that which God
does not find fault with?"</p>

<p>"Most assuredly not."</p>

<p>"Is it more difficult to please God than it is an
earthly parent?"</p>

<p>"I dare not assert that it is."</p>

<p>"Are you not satisfied with your child, if you know
that it is doing the very best it knows how?"</p>

<p>"I should be an unkind parent if I were not."</p>

<p>"Resting, then, upon these self-evident propositions,
Mr. Gordon, I have no right to be troubled about the
future."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Miss Harlow?"</p>

<p>"I mean to say, that I am doing as well as I know
how; that I never knowingly commit a wrong act:
consequently, God is satisfied with me, and, being so,
will take care of me."</p>

<p>"Trusting in your own righteousness, my poor
child."</p>

<p>"No: in God's righteousness,&mdash;in the certainty that
he will do just right; that he will not be angry with
me for not doing better than I know how."</p>

<p>"Alas, alas! it is as I feared: blinded by your own
false reasoning, you will not accept the true Saviour,
because you do not see the need of him."</p>

<p>"Mr. Gordon, I confess I do not understand the theology
of the churches: do you?"</p>

<p>"Do I?"</p>

"Yes: do you understand what you teach, any further

<!-- page 147 -->

than doing justly, dealing rightly with your fellow-creatures
is concerned?"</p>

<p>"I must confess, with Paul, that 'great is the mystery
of godliness.' "</p>

<p>"How, then, can you, how could he, teach others
that which was a mystery?"</p>

<p>"How can we teach a mystery?"</p>

<p>"Yes: how can you teach a mystery, Mr. Gordon?
If you understand a thing, it is no longer a mystery;
and, if you do not understand it, how can you teach
it?"</p>

<p>"We can understand the commandments. Miss Harlow:
'Thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not steal,' &amp;c."</p>

<p>"Yes: but what has that to do with 'God manifest
in the flesh,' 'being born again,' &amp;c.?"</p>

<p>"Simply this: if we violate these laws, we must suffer
the penalty, unless we accept the Saviour provided."</p>

<p>"But you have acknowledged, Mr. Gordon, that
these things are a mystery; that you yourself do
not understand them: for, if you did, they would no
longer be a mystery to you, if they were to Paul.
Now, what I wish to know is this: how can we accept
a mystery, and be sure that we are not deceived?
that it is just what it claims to be?"</p>

<p>"You are asking hard questions, Helen."</p>

<p>"You gave me permission to ask questions, sir."</p>

<p>"I did; and I presume they will do me good. There
are none of us who think any too deeply."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon had thus far been simply a listener;
but now she said, "I was fearful, husband, when you
told me that you intended to talk with Miss Harlow

<!-- page 148 -->

upon these subjects, that you would get into deep
water."</p>

<p>"Well, wife, there is no harm done: it does one
good to get into deep water occasionally."</p>

<p>"That is, if they do not go so deep but that they
can get out again, I presume you mean," was her
playful reply.</p>

<p>"But I have more questions to ask, Mr. Gordon,"
said Helen.</p>

<p>"Well, go on: it can do no harm to ask them, even
if I can not answer them satisfactorily."</p>

<p>"What is meant by 'visiting the iniquities of the
fathers upon the children, to the third and fourth generation'?"</p>

<p>"That law is done away with: the prophet emphatically
says that the proverb, 'The fathers have eaten
sour grapes,' should no more be used; but that every
soul should bear its own sin."</p>

<p>"Does God change?"</p>

<p>"Not really; but he may in his manner of dealing
with us."</p>

<p>"Where is the difference, so far as we are concerned,
whether the change is an absolute or a relative one.
If he changes in his manner of dealing with us, he is
to us a changeable God; and it matters not what he
may be otherwise."</p>

<p>"How, then, do you reconcile the above?"</p>

<p>"I do not try to reconcile it. I am not a teacher of
theology, but I will tell you what I am doing, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah! and what are you doing?"</p>

<p>"I am thinking, questioning."</p>

<p>"Be careful, my child, that your questioning does
not lead you astray."</p>

<!-- page 149 -->

<p>"It is my opinion that a lack of thought would be
more apt to have that tendency; but it is true, sir,
that I have thought more deeply since listening to the
story of poor Jane Morgan, than I ever did before; at
least in some directions."</p>

<p>"Indeed! and what was there in her history to affect
you so deeply?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you." Helen then proceeded to give
Mr. Gordon and his wife the main incidents in the
life of that unfortunate creature, dwelling more particularly
upon what related to her boy, and her explanation
of the causes which she believed had made him
what he was.</p>

<p>The story awakened a new train of thought in the
minds of both Mr. Gordon and his wife; and they were
silent for some minutes after Helen had finished her
recital. Mrs. Gordon was the first to speak. "I am
not prepared to accept the conclusions that such a
theory would lead to," she said; "but I feel that there
is a truth there somewhere. I can trace in my own
children the influences that were brought to bear upon
me before their birth; though I had never thought
upon the fact in the light that you present it, Miss
Harlow."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to present these things in any particular
light; for I do not see them clearly,&mdash;can not
understand, as yet, their real bearing. I only tell
them as they were told to me; and I, too, must say that
my observation tends to confirm her conclusions. It
seems to me, however, that it is in this manner that
God visits the iniquities of the fathers, and of the
mothers too, upon the children, to the third and fourth
generation."</p>

<!-- page 150 -->

"You mean," said Mr. Gordon, "that it will take
three or four generations to educate out of children
the evil tendencies born with them in consequence of
the sins of parents?"</p>

<p>"Something like that," was the reply.</p>

<p>"It looks as if there was a truth here," said he,
after another silence; "but, if so, I shall have to re-adjust
my theology to find a place for it."</p>

<p>"Suppose, Mr. Gordon," said Helen, "that we continue
to adjust our lives to the practical in religion, so
that we shall need no re-adjustment there; suppose
we continue to do this, and leave the theoretical, the
theological, the mysterious, till deeper thought and
fuller experiences enable us to decide more intelligently."</p>

<p>"A very wise proposition; and I, for one, shall be
glad to accede to it," said Mrs. Gordon; "but, as
husband's business is teaching, I don't know what he
will think of it."</p>

<p>"Don't laugh at me, wife: I hope I am a learner as
well as a teacher; for I am certain there is need enough
of it."</p>

<p>"You have at least satisfied your conscience in
respect to me," said Helen.</p>

<p>"Satisfied my conscience?"</p>

<p>"Yes: was it not conscience, a sense of your duty
as a minister, that prompted you to speak to me of my
soul?"</p>

<p>"I believe it was, Miss Harlow; but I confess the
task to have been a great one for me: so, remember,
you must look out for your own welfare on that point
after this."</p>

<!-- page 151 -->

<p>"I will remember," she said; "and shall talk with
you again upon these points some time."</p>

<p>"I hope you will give me plenty of time to think
first," he replied.</p>

<p>"As much as you please, so that you really <i>think</i>."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p class="small">FOR THE LAST TIME.</p>

<br/>

<p class="small">"Yet once again I ask, Wilt thou be mine?"</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>THINGS moved on in their usual channel
at Lakeside. Charles, or Charlie as he
was always called, was ten years of age,
and as fine, active a boy as was to be
found in all the country round. Helen
had never sent him to school; but he was far in
advance, in his studies, of any boy of his age. People
had accepted it as a settled fact, that Helen Harlow
was competent to take care of herself, and that she
would have her own way; consequently, they had
ceased to dictate, or even to hope to change her purposes.</p>

<p>All but one; and he could hardly be said to hope, only
as against hope. William Reid made one more effort
to induce her to become his wife. He had been absent
for several months; and, when she had the least thought
of seeing him, she looked up, and he was standing
before her.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mr. Reid. I was not thinking of
seeing you to-day. I did not suppose you had returned."</p>

<p>"And do you ever think of me, Helen?" he asked.</p>

<!-- page 153 -->

<p>"Most certainly I do. I should be very ungrateful
to forget so good a friend as you."</p>

<p>"Gratitude! I had as soon you would forget me
entirely."</p>

<p>"That I could not do, if I should try; and I have
no disposition to try, even if that would effect such a
result."</p>

<p>"O Helen! you are heartless!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am; but, if so, am worthless to any one
but myself."</p>

<p>"You are the proudest woman I ever saw."</p>

<p>"I believe you have told me that before, Mr. Reid."</p>

<p>"Mr. Reid! I wish you would never 'mister' me
again."</p>

<p>"I should miss you very much, then; for, in that
case, you would be obliged to go where I could not see
you."</p>

<p>"I doubt very much if you would miss me, even
should you never see me again."</p>

<p>"Are you sick this morning, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, heartsick."</p>

<p>"Then you are not heartless, as you say I am;
otherwise you could not be heartsick."</p>

<p>"O Helen, Helen! you will drive me wild."</p>

<p>"What ails you, Mr. Reid? I never saw you manifest
such a spirit."</p>

<p>"And you will never see me manifest such a spirit
again. Miss Harlow."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you say so."</p>

<p>"Of course, you are; and will be more so when you
hear the why, I suppose."</p>

<p>"As to that, I can tell better when I hear it."</p>

<!-- page 154 -->

<p>Reid sat for some time in silence. "Helen," said he
at length, "I have been rude this morning, have been
cross, and I know it; but I have come, for the last
time, to ask you a question to which I felt so certain
you would say 'No' that it angered me."</p>

<p>"Why ask it, then?"</p>

<p>"Because I must, I will: I shall ask it for this only
time, remember; so take time to think before you reply.
Helen, will you be my wife?"</p>

<p>"And this is the last time you will ask this question,
Mr. Reid?"</p>

<p>"The very last time, Miss Harlow."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it."</p>

<p>"I expected you would be; but you have not
answered me yet."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it," she continued, without
noticing his last remark, "for two reasons: first, because
it will save me the further pain of saying 'No' to
one I respect too highly to willingly give him pain; and
the other reason is, you would not be so positive that
it is the last time, if your mind had not begun to turn
toward some one else."</p>

<p>"But you have not said 'No' yet."</p>

<p>"Have I not told you, Mr. Reid, that I did not love
you?"</p>

<p>"You have; but you said further, that you would
not marry me if you did love me."</p>

<p>"And what did you infer from that?"</p>

<p>"Why, that you did love me a little, after all; and,
being conscious of the fact, added that to make the
'No' seem strong, when it was not really so."</p>

<p>"O man! thy name is vanity," said Helen, smiling.</p>

<!-- page 155 -->

<p>"Why add that last clause, then?"</p>

<p>"To show you how utterly impossible it was for me
to grant your request. I said, in effect, I would not
marry you under the circumstances, even if I loved
you; but, as I do not love you, there can be no possible
ground for you to hope."</p>

<p>"And you still say the same?"</p>

<p>"I still say the same."</p>

<p>"Well, you are Godlike in one respect, if in no
other."</p>

<p>"How is that?"</p>

<p>"There is no variableness nor shadow of turning
about you. If the truth were known, I believe you
love that"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Reid!"</p>

<p>"I know that I am a wretch, Helen, to refer to such
a thing; but it makes me angry to see so much love
and devotion thrown away."</p>

<p>"You were just in accusing me of being heartless."</p>

<p>"Well, I knew better than that. I am not myself
this morning. But what makes you think that my
mind is turning toward some one else, Helen?"</p>

<p>"Because you never loved me."</p>

<p>"Helen!"</p>

<p>"It is true, sir, and you will find it out yet. You
thought you did, and hate to acknowledge, even to
yourself, that you have been mistaken; and that is
what has made you so irritable, so unreasonable, this
morning."</p>

<p>Reid looked at her in astonishment. "Helen," said
he, "there is no woman on earth that I esteem as I do
you."</p>

<!-- page 156 -->

<p>"And there is no one among all my acquaintance
that I <i>esteem</i> more highly than I do you; but it is not
of esteem that we are talking."</p>

<p>"Did I say esteem?"</p>

<p>"You did, sir; and it is the right word. You shake
your head; but you will find that I am telling you the
truth."</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"You would not say 'perhaps' if you did not feel
'perhaps.' I tell you, William Reid, had I said 'Yes'
to your request, you would have been disappointed,
and not so happy as you imagine."</p>

<p>"I can not think you are right, Helen, for I know
of no woman that I would as soon call 'wife' as you;
but, since there has been so much said, I will own that
there is one lady that I may try to win, as you give me
no hope."</p>

<p>"But you will continue to <i>esteem</i> me as highly as
ever?" asked Helen with a look of mock distress.</p>

<p>Reid looked annoyed. "Helen, you are too bad."</p>

<p>"Am I? What do you wish me to do? cry about
it?"</p>

<p>He laughed in spite of himself. "It would do you
no good if you did: it is too late to cry now."</p>

<p>"But not too late to attend your wedding; that is,
if you <i>esteem</i> me enough to invite me."</p>

<p>"No, Helen, I shall never invite you to my wedding;"
and there was a sadness in his tones which made
her tremble for the happiness of the one he should
marry.</p>

<p>"Well, be that as it may," she replied; "but be true
to yourself, whatever you do."</p>

<!-- page 157 -->

<p>"Not with your idea of being true; for then I should
spend the remainder of my days alone. But I shall
only annoy you by further remark, and so farewell;"
and he was gone.</p>

<p>Gone, leaving Helen sadder than she had ever yet
been at his departure. Not that she regretted her
decision, or was sorry that the conflict between them
was over. No, not that; but the cross-purposes of life
troubled her. Why was it? Why should the carrying
out of one's purposes, one's highest convictions of
right, conflict with the dearest hopes of another?</p>

<p>Beside, there was a something in Reid's manner, as
he left her, which made her feel that perhaps she had
been unjust to him; that possibly he had not been as
much mistaken in his feelings toward her as she had
tried to make him and herself believe. If so, would
he ever be happy again? If not, he certainly could
not make another happy; and thus two lives would be
spoiled instead of one.</p>

<p>Perhaps her idea of but one true love was false, after
all. She hoped that it was; for then there would be
hope that Reid could be happy with another. This
thought threw her back into herself. Admitting this,
could she not have been happy with another than the
one who had so cruelly deceived her? Was she not
sacrificing herself, and another also, to a false idea, a
chimera of the brain, a utopian resolution? Was she
not ministering to a morbid pride in thus boldly wearing
the mantle of disgrace, when she might so easily
cast it off?</p>

<p>Never in all these years had she been so shaken as
now; and it was not until she thought of the words of

<!-- page 158 -->

poor old Jane, that she could recover her equanimity.
"Oh! if I could have had an example like yours before
me, I would have dared all."</p>

<p>The remembrance of these words turned her mind
from self, toward the multitudes who are thus constantly
being crushed by that state of public sentiment
which takes sides with the strong against the weak,
with the wrong-doer against the wronged.</p>

<p>"Yes," said she, "I see it now: here is my work;
and, if I faint under the cross, I shall show myself too
weak to bear the weight of glory which clusters around
the crown." And thus content came again to her
tried spirit, and she went cheerfully onward in her
chosen path.</p>

<p>A few months afterward, when she heard of Reid's
marriage with a young and lovely woman every way
worthy to be his wife, she rejoiced that it was so, and
sent forth her prayers for their happiness, unmingled
with a single regret; and so peacefully did her life
glide onward, she forgot, at times, that it had ever been
otherwise.</p>

<p>Still, she was ever busy,&mdash;ever striving to gather
knowledge for herself and boy; knowing that the sunshine
could not last always and that it</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

<p class="small">ANOTHER STORY.</p>

<br/>

<p class="small">"Another unfortunate gone to her death."</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>"TAKE her into Helen Harlow's. It is
the <i>fittest</i> place for her."</p>

<p>Helen knew that voice, though she had
not heard it for years,&mdash;the voice of
the woman who called her boy's father
husband. She looked out, and saw that a woman had
fainted but a few feet from her door,&mdash;a woman who
was still young, had been beautiful, but was now an
outcast,&mdash;one of the pariahs of our Christian land.
Near her stood Mrs. Grant, Mrs. Granger, and Mrs.
Fitzhammer, impeded in their progress by this woman
lying directly in their path.</p>

<p>Helen's was the nearest place to which she could be
removed; and these three women were urging those
who were gathering around to carry her there.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Helen, "bring her in;" casting her eyes,
at the same time, upon the trio: "but don't let her
touch their immaculate garments; she would probably
never have been what she is but for some such men
as their husbands."</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger's eyes flashed fire. "I presume that
you know, if any one does," she retorted.</p>

<!-- page 160 -->

<p>"I know of one of them," Helen replied, with a
concentration of tone that made her persecutor quail.
It was the nearest that she had ever come to acknowledging
the parentage of her child.</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger was white with anger. "Come,"
said she to her companions, as soon as she could speak
for rage,&mdash;"come; let us no longer disgrace ourselves
by being in the vicinity of such brazen-faced shamelessness."</p>

<p>In the mean time, the poor creature had been carried
into the house, and placed upon Helen's comfortable
lounge, while Helen herself was hastening to bathe the
brow and temples of the unconscious form.</p>

<p>She started as the cooling liquid touched her, and
murmured, "Mother!" and then, opening her eyes and
seeing the strange face bending above her, groaned
aloud. Helen motioned for the others to leave. "I
will take care of her," said she; and those strong men
went out from the presence of the heroic girl feeling
more reverence for her than they would have cared
to express.</p>

<p>Helen had often heard of this class of women, but
had never before seen one that she knew to be such;
and she felt her heart swelling with pity as she gazed
upon the mournful-looking eyes and sunken cheeks.
True, her knowledge of this one's condition, or, rather,
character, was more instinctive than otherwise; for,
aside from what she saw and felt, she had had no other
indication than the scornful tone of Mrs. Granger,
when suggesting that the woman should be taken into
her house as a <i>fitting place</i>.</p>

<p>But, whatever else she was, she was a woman,&mdash;one

<!-- page 161 -->

who had loved, suffered, and sunk, instead of riding
in triumph upon the billows of sorrow; and Helen,
as I have said, felt an intense pity as she looked upon
her.</p>

<p>Her present condition was the result of the combined
effects of hunger and disease; and it was evident that
her days of earthly suffering were nearly at an end.
Helen asked no questions, but, with the charity that
"relieveth first," directed her efforts toward making
the sufferer comfortable. One or two curiosity-seekers
dropped in to take notes for the mart of gossip; but
were so quietly dismissed, that they were hardly aware
of the fact, supposing that they had left of their own
accord. The stranger submitted to every thing that
was done, with a half-bewildered air, as though it was
all a dream, from which she should presently awake;
and, after being bathed, and arrayed in clean garments,
she sank into a sound slumber, from which she did not
awake till the following morning.</p>

<p>"Poor thing! let her sleep," thought Helen, as she
gazed upon the emaciated features.</p>

<p>She awoke, at length, with a start. "Where am
I?" she asked, springing to a sitting position.</p>

<p>"Among friends," replied Helen.</p>

<p>"Friends! I have none!" and then, clasping the
thin hands, she shrieked, "O mother, mother! why
did you die and leave me?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Helen, going to her, and placing
her hand upon the throbbing temples. This burst of
feeling ended in a flood of tears, and then she grew
calmer.</p>

<p>"I dreamed," said she, "that my mother was here;

<!-- page 162 -->

and it seemed so real, that, when I awoke to find that it
was but a dream, I felt as if I could not bear it." Then,
after lying silent a while, she added, "Oh! I remember
now. I fainted in the street, and you brought me in
here. Yes, I fainted. You are Helen Harlow, are you
not?"</p>

<p>"I am Helen Harlow."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I will tell you all. I fainted, but not
so much from weakness, though I was weak, and very
tired. Still, I should not have fainted, had I not met
one that I had known in better days,&mdash;the sister of the
man who deceived and forsook me."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me his name?" asked Helen.</p>

<p>"Yes: I said I would tell you all. It was Herbert
Ward."</p>

<p>"Ella Ward's brother!" She did not say Mrs.
Granger.</p>

<p>"Yes: her name is Granger now, I believe." Helen
assented by a nod of the head, and the stranger
continued: "We were poor, but of as good a family
as the Wards. But I have not told you my name.
It is Ransom,&mdash;Elda Ransom. My father, Judge Ransom,
lived in Boston, and had once a comfortable fortune;
but, losing it through the villainy of one he
trusted, we were reduced to poverty; and this so affected
him that he sickened and died. I believe that
men sink under misfortune sooner than women, if they
are called the stronger sex."</p>

<p>"But how did you become acquainted with the
Wards?" asked Helen.</p>

<p>"They boarded with us,&mdash;Herbert and his sister.
They were attending school in Boston; and, after

<!-- page 163 -->

father's death, mother took a few boarders in order to
sustain herself and keep me at school."</p>

<p>"Had you no brothers or sisters?"</p>

<p>"Not living. Mother had had five children,&mdash;three
sons and one daughter beside myself; but these
all died in early childhood: and oh that I had died
too!" And there was another passionate fit of weeping.</p>

<p>Helen waited quietly till it had subsided, and then
brought her back to the subject by saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Herbert and his sister boarded with you, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes: for nearly two years we were constant companions,
and they both professed the warmest friendship.
I was beautiful, so they told me, and Herbert
professed to love me devotedly; and I more than loved,&mdash;I
worshiped him.</p>

<p>"Ella, too, was my friend, till she began to fear
that Herbert would marry me, and then she used all
her influence against me. She told him that I did not
love him, and had confessed as much to a schoolmate;
but that I would marry him because he was rich, and
could give my mother a home.</p>

<p>"He came to me with this accusation, driving me
almost wild with his doubts, or with his pretended
doubts; for I now believe them to have been only a
pretense, for the purpose of bringing me more fully
into his power. I cried and protested,&mdash;fool that I
was!&mdash;and he finally professed to be satisfied. Things
went on as before, for two or three weeks, when he
again came to me with what he called evidence of my
duplicity.</p>

<p>"He raved like a madman; said if he could not

<!-- page 164 -->

trust me he could trust no one; and that he did not
care to live. He frightened me: I actually feared that
he would take his own life. He swore that he would,
unless he could have proof, that would settle the question
beyond a doubt, that I loved him and him only.</p>

<p>" 'But what can I do more than I have done?' I
asked.</p>

<p>"He walked back and forth through the room for
ten minutes, perhaps: it seemed an age to me. Finally
he stopped in front of me. 'There is but one
thing, Elda,' said he, 'that will satisfy me; and that I
have no right to ask: and so I must leave you;" and
turned to leave the room.</p>

<p>" 'Any thing, any thing!' I shrieked, throwing
myself before him; 'for I can not live without you.'</p>

<p>" 'Are you in earnest?' he asked, taking my hands
in his.</p>

<p>" 'Certainly I am,' I replied; for I did not even then
suspect what he would ask: he had always been so
respectful, that I did not once imagine such a thing.</p>

<p>"He caught me to his breast; he rained kisses on
cheeks, lip, neck, and bosom; and between the bliss
of having his love again, and the fear of&mdash;what, I
hardly knew, I had no power to resist him. And the
sequel, so far as he was concerned, needs not to be
told."</p>

<p>She did not look into Helen's face during this
recital; consequently did not see the tears that her
story had brought to Helen's eyes.</p>

<p>"Did his sister know aught of this?" asked Helen
at length.</p>

<p>"Not at first; but she found it out by watching. I

<!-- page 165 -->

shall never forget the day she came to me, with the
fatal secret upon her lips. She heaped upon me every
vile epithet that she could think of; said that I had
tempted Herbert on purpose to induce him to marry
me, but that she would not have the family so disgraced.
She even threatened my life if I ever dared
to mention his name in connection with any thing that
might occur.</p>

<p>"She might have spared herself this, for I was too
heart-broken to make even an effort to stem the tide
that was bearing me to utter ruin. Well, to cut the
story short, my baby died, my mother died, the world
cast me off, and what was there for me but sin?</p>

<p>"For a while, so long as my beauty remained, I was
well dressed and well cared for. But, when this began
to fade, I commenced going down, down, till here I
am. The end is at hand, and I am glad of it."</p>

<p>"But how came you here in this country-place?"</p>

<p>"I came to see you, Miss Harlow."</p>

<p>"Me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you: with your quiet life here, you do not
know how much your courage and perseverance is
whispered abroad. You little dream how many sorrowing
ones are saying, 'Oh! if I had had but one such
example before me, I, too, would have stemmed the
tide.' "</p>

<p>"But all women who have once been deceived do
not follow a life of shame."</p>

<p>"I know that they do not; but what kind of a life
do they have? One of sufferance. They go, the balance
of their days, with drooping head and downcast
eyes, acknowledging by every movement that they are

<!-- page 166 -->

sinners above all others. If they will do this,&mdash;if, to
use a homely but expressive phrase,&mdash;if they will eat
humble-pie the rest of their lives, then Christians will
receive them as a sort of mendicant upon their charity,
who may possibly&mdash;that is, if they are humble enough&mdash;find
a seat at last in heaven."</p>

<p>"You paint a strong picture. Miss Ransom."</p>

<p>"Please don't."</p>

<p>"Don't what?"</p>

<p>"Don't call me by that name; it reminds me too
vividly of happier days. Say Elda, if you will, but not
Miss."</p>

<p>"I think that you are eating humble-pie now."</p>

<p>"If I am, you do not furnish nor exact it. But is
my picture too highly colored?"</p>

<p>"I can not say that it is, Elda."</p>

<p>"Of course, you can not. She must either do this,
or she must marry some one who is every way beneath
her, <i>to cover up the disgrace</i>. Just as though a woman
was made more pure by associating constantly with a
mean man, because he is her husband!"</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said Helen, "that people have
strange ideas of purity."</p>

<p>"That is what I think; but you are the only one,
Miss Harlow, of the thousands that become the victims
of man's falsehood,&mdash;you are the only one I have ever
heard of who would not accept the injustice meted out
to you, who has demanded and received respect; received
it upon your own terms too.</p>

<p>"Now, this is what we want, what we must have,
or the most of those who have been thus wronged will
sink in spite of every thing. The law of sympathy is

<!-- page 167 -->

strong, and human nature is proud. To be constantly
surrounded by those who look down upon us is terrible;
and we naturally flee to those who are in a like or a
worse condition than ourselves, as a sort of protection
from this crushing sense of humiliation. If they would
only give us a hope, a possibility, of full reinstatement,
it would be different. But no: no matter how cruelly
we have been deceived, no matter how aggravated the
wrongs which have brought about the result, eternal
disgrace is the verdict."</p>

<p>"Yes; and will be, till woman herself repudiates
that verdict, refuses to accept it either for herself or
others," said Helen.</p>

<p>"And that is why, Miss Harlow, that I say you little
realize the influence you are having. You have done
this, and successfully; have demonstrated the possibility:
thus becoming the star of hope to many a breaking
heart."</p>

<p>Helen wept; but they were tears of joy. "God
grant that it may prove so!" she said. "But there is
much to be done yet. I have won the battle here, in
my own home and its surroundings; but let me once
go forth into the world, and then see."</p>

<p>"You would have to contend for every inch of
ground," replied Elda; "but every inch that you
gained, you would hold,&mdash;and not for yourself only, but
for others. Please give me a glass of water: I am
faint."</p>

<p>"You have talked too much for your strength," said
Helen, as she hastened to comply with the request.
"There, now lie and rest a while, and you will be better."</p>

<!-- page 168 -->

<p>"I shall never be better," murmured the pale lips,
as she sank away into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>"Never in this world," thought Helen, as she looked
upon her. Disease had done its work. The temporary
excitement over, and the feeble frame gave way utterly.
She opened her eyes once, gasped the word, "Mother!"
and, before Helen could summon assistance, she was
gone.</p>

<p>Again the services of the Rev. Mr. Gordon were in
requisition, and again there was a quiet funeral from
Helen's door.</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon, whenever he called on Helen at Lakeside,
or when he came, as he sometimes did, to take her
to Glencove to spend the sabbath,&mdash;in either case he
always brought Mrs. Gordon with him. She knew that
this was done to avoid even the "appearance of evil;"
but she knew, also, that, but for her position before the
world, it would not be considered necessary; thus showing
that even there she was still condemned.</p>

<p>This&mdash;not the fact itself, but that which it indicated&mdash;sometimes
aroused a feeling of bitterness in her
heart; consequently, she was better prepared to understand
the feeling expressed by Elda than she otherwise
could have been. So she did not wait till some future
time, as she had in Jane's case, to tell Mr. Gordon the
story of wrong, but related it that evening after the
funeral.</p>

<p>"Now, are these things right?" she asked, when she
had finished the recital.</p>

<p>"How can you ask such a question, Helen? You
know they are not!" exclaimed Mr. and Mrs. Gordon
in the same breath.</p>

<!-- page 169 -->

<p>"Why, then, do Christian people permit them, accept
them, act from them?"</p>

<p>"We can not have things as we would in this wicked
world; we can not control the multitude, for we have
no authority over any but our own members," said Mr.
Gordon hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Ah! but you do not control them. The influence
of your teachings does not even result in a spirit of
charity; for, as a body, church-members are more
severe on such than are those of the outside world."</p>

<p>"Of course, they naturally loathe <i>sin more</i>."</p>

<p>"Why, then, not loathe it as much in a man as in a
woman?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon did not reply, and Helen continued:
"I read a story not long since, in which an artist
seduces a young girl from her home, to be the companion
of his travels. Soon after, he paints a picture called
'The Magdalen,' and sends it forth to the world to be
the admiration of thousands as a work of art. The
painting bore the face of this young girl. She loved
him,&mdash;him only, him devotedly; and this was her reward.</p>

<p>"Finally, the mother-feeling awakes in her heart;
and love for her unborn babe gives her the power to
plead with him so eloquently, that she prevails, and he
makes her his wife. A few months afterward, as he
gazes upon that mother with her babe in her arms, he is
so delighted, that he paints another picture,&mdash;'The Madonna;'
but the face of the mother, beaming with love
as she gazes on her child, is the same as that which represented
the 'Magdalen,'&mdash;the same woman, with no
change but on his part. Now, what do these things

<!-- page 170 -->

mean? Where is the remedy for them? How shall
woman escape from this tyranny, this injustice?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon was about to reply; but she interrupted
him with, "No, not now: don't answer me now. Take
time to think,&mdash;to think long and deeply; and in the
future this shall be one of the problems which we will
discuss,&mdash;which I hope and pray we may solve satisfactorily."</p>

<p>"Amen," said both Mr. and Mrs. Gordon, more
deeply moved than either of them had ever been before
upon the same subject.</p>

<p>As to Helen's course with Elda Ransom, it could not
well have been otherwise than the subject of a nine-days'
talk; but, self-poised as she was, she cared as
little for this as does the oak for the chattering of the
crows in its branches.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p class="small">A DECENT WOMAN.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p class="small">"Souls of so gross a mould, they know as much of purity as wallowing swine
of cleanliness: how they will rave, if, on a robe of white, they find a single
stain!"&mdash;L. W.</p>

<br/>

<p>IT was as Helen had said: she had conquered
for herself respect at home, where
she was known; but no sooner did she
step beyond it than her battles must be
fought again. Her boy had now reached
an age when it was desirable that he should have better
advantages than could be furnished at Lakeside; and so
she concluded to send him away to school.</p>

<p>Previous to doing this, however, she gave him a history
of his parentage, told him of the vow she had
made before his birth, and of her hope that he would
help to make that vow good.</p>

<p>If there was aught on earth that Charles Harlow
worshiped, it was his mother. His eye kindled with indignation
as he listened to her story; and, when she had
finished, he threw his arms around her and exclaimed,
"Dear mother, you shall never blush for your boy!"</p>

<p>Springville, the seat of a flourishing academy, lay
about sixty miles to the north-east; and thither the
most of the youths of the place were sent, where
parents were able to give them the advantages of such

<!-- page 172 -->

a school. Helen decided that Charles should go to this
school for at least a couple of years; but she would go
with him, and see that he was well cared for, before she
left him alone among strangers.</p>

<p>It was a hard task for her to make up her mind to
let him go from her; but, having once decided that it
was best, she did not hesitate. He must leave her
some time, that was certain; and how could he successfully
battle with the world, unless he learned to
stand alone, to depend upon himself. He was now sixteen
years of age, and it was time that he began to
depend upon his own resources.</p>

<p>About half way between Lakeside and Springville
was the public-house of Job Jenkins, or, rather, of Mrs.
Job, for she really ruled both him and the house. Mrs.
Job Jenkins was a character in her way,&mdash;really a good
housekeeper, so far as cleanliness and thoroughness were
concerned; but she had a perfect hatred of every thing
that she chose to call laziness or pride. Consequently,
every thing about her had a sort of cast-iron stiffness:
no rocking-chairs, no comfortable lounge; she didn't
believe in "sich nonsense."</p>

<p>Tall, angular, bony, with none of the sweetest of
tempers: it was said that the contents of her husband's
bar did not add any thing to its quality; but we
will not vouch for that. She gave her customers a
good clean bed, however, and plenty of wholesome
food; so that, notwithstanding the drawback of her unprepossessing
appearance and manner, they did quite a
business in the way of keeping travelers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jenkins would never wear any thing but the
plainest of clothes, and as plainly made up as possible:

<!-- page 173 -->

"she couldn't see, for her part, what a decent woman
wanted of sich gimcracks and flumididdles."
She hated a pretty woman, and had no confidence in
men in general, and Job in particular. "They are so
easily made fools of," she said, "they all need some
decent woman to take care of 'em, and keep 'em out of
mischief."</p>

<p>It was here that Helen stopped with her son for the
night, when on her way to Springville. They were
hardly seated at the table, when Mrs. Job was called
out to wait upon another arrival. "Right in here,
right in here, good folks; supper is jist on the table;"
and she led the way, followed by Mr. and Mrs. Granger
of Albright. They had been to Springville on a
similar errand to that on which Helen was going,&mdash;to
take their son there; and were now on their way home.</p>

<p>It was the first time that Helen and Granger had
met in all these years. She was so calm, so self-possessed,
that none but the closest observer could have
noted the tokens of deeply-stirred feeling. But Granger's
confusion was only too evident. How he quailed
before the clear eye of the woman he had wronged!
and, as he quickly glanced from mother to son, how he
longed to take that son by the hand and imprint a
father's kiss upon his brow!</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger drew haughtily back. "Thank you:
I prefer to wait, to eating in such company." Granger
frowned, and Charles flushed at this open insult;
but Helen gave no indication that she noticed it. Mrs.
Granger was retiring toward the sitting-room, when the
words,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your father, my son," arrested and brought her back.</p>

<!-- page 174 -->

<p>"You acknowledge it then, you shameless creature!"
she fairly screamed; and then, in the very next breath,
"It is false; and you know it is!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Job looked from one to the other with a puzzled
air, muttering to herself, "Pretty doings these, in a
decent woman's house!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger turned upon her with "Why do you
keep such creatures in your house, then, if you are a
decent woman?"</p>

<p>"La, now! you needn't bite a body's head off. What
did I know about her, only that she come in the stage
and stopped here. A decent woman is sure to be imposed
on, if she don't keep her eye-teeth skinned."</p>

<p>"Well, you know now. Look at her, will you?
That great boy calling her mother, and she not a married
woman! and not a single blush on her face,&mdash;the
shameless creature!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Job was fairly aroused. "Away with you!" she
shouted, as Mr. Job, attracted by the noise, came peering
in like a scared chicken, to see what the matter was.</p>

<p>"Away with you, Job Jenkins! It's a good thing that
you've got a decent woman to take care of you, or sich
critters would have ruined you long ago." And then,
turning to Helen, "What do you mean, imposin' on a
decent woman? Just pick up your traps now, and
leave."</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly," replied Helen. "When I
find myself in bad company, I always get out of it as
soon as possible."</p>

<p>This reply so irritated Mrs. Job, that, but for Granger's
interference, she would have dealt Helen a heavy
blow.</p>

<!-- page 175 -->

<p>"You need not interfere, sir," said Charles, stepping
quickly forward: "I will protect my mother."</p>

<p>"I hope you will always be able to do it, my son,"
replied Granger.</p>

<p>"Job, Job! can't you protect your own lawful wife?"
shrieked Mrs. Job, as she shook Granger's grasp from
her arm.</p>

<p>"Hear him now," said Mrs. Granger, fairly choking
with rage: "hear him call that creature's child his son;
and that in the presence of his own wedded wife!"</p>

<p>"Helen," continued Granger, paying no attention to
his wife's anger, "these two termagants shall not drive
you from this house to-night."</p>

<p>"I prefer to go, Mr. Granger. Mrs. Granger, years
ago, threatened the victim of her brother's lust, poor
Elda Ransom, with death, if she dared to reveal his
guilt; and she has attempted my life once: so I think
that I shall be safer elsewhere."</p>

<p>"It is false, you shameless wretch!"</p>

<p>"I can bring proof, madam, that you tried to burn me
in my bed."</p>

<p>"I simply wanted to smoke you and "&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ella!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger looked into her husband's face: there
was an expression there that she had never seen before,
and she dared not complete the sentence.</p>

<p>"Burn you out? certainly I would," said Mrs. Job;
"and so would any decent woman. Let me catch my
Job calling any other woman's brat his son, and I'll
scratch her eyes out; and so would any decent woman."</p>

<p>"What's wantin'?" asked Job, peering in at the
door.</p>

<!-- page 176 -->

<p>"A horse and carriage, to take myself and son to
Springville to-night," promptly responded Helen.</p>

<p>"Back with ye, ye sneak!" was Mrs. Job's loving
reply.</p>

<p>"But you called me," said he, manifesting a disposition
to stand his ground for once.</p>

<p>"And so I did; but, if ye can't cum when ye're
wanted, ye needn't cum at all. A man never'll cum
when a decent woman calls."</p>

<p>"Can I have a horse and carriage?" repeated Helen.</p>

<p>"No, yer can't. Tramp it afoot, as ye'll have to yet,
when ye'r beauty's gone," said Mrs. Job, with a mocking
leer.</p>

<p>"Yes, you can. Mr. Jenkins, have a conveyance made
ready for this lady immediately," thundered Granger,
in tones that poor Job was only too willing to obey,
provided his better-half did not object too strongly.</p>

<p>"It'll cost a powerful sight," he put in deprecatingly.
Job said this on purpose; for, if he could only get Mrs.
Job's mind on the money part of the matter, she would
say nothing further against Helen's having a conveyance
to any point she wished.</p>

<p>The bait took: still, Mrs. Job would not give up too
readily. "Who's goin' to drive, I'd jist like to know?"
she said. "You needn't think ye'll git the chance,
Job."</p>

<p>"I will drive, if there is no one else to go,&mdash;that is,
with the lady's consent," said Granger.</p>

<p>"You!" exclaimed Mrs. Granger, bursting into
hysterical sobs: "after all that I have done to keep up
the credit of the family, you will offer to take that
creature out there,&mdash;to have her son as an associate

<!-- page 177 -->

for our Herbert! Oh that I should live to see this
day!"</p>

<p>"You need not trouble yourself, madam. I shall not
accept his services," said Helen.</p>

<p>After a little delay, a driver was found; and Mrs.
Job's eyes glistened as she saw the money counted out
to pay for that night's ride; but still, she could not forbear
remarking, "Of course, sich as she can have money
when a decent woman can hardly git a decent dress to
her back."</p>

<p>On arriving at Springville, Helen first found a place
where they could have both refreshment and rest; after
which, she sought the principal of the academy, in order
to make the necessary arrangements for Charles's entering
the school.</p>

<p>"Helen Harlow!" repeated Prof. Wright musingly.
"Were you educated a Quaker, madam?"</p>

<p>"I was not," she replied.</p>

<p>"You are a widow, I presume?"</p>

<p>"What has my domestic history to do with my son's
entering your school?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing; nothing at all, madam," said he deprecatingly,
shrinking from the indignant flash in her eye.
"Still, we like to know something of the history of those
we have under our care."</p>

<p>"You have a given sum for board, tuition, and incidentals;
do you not, sir?"</p>

<p>"We do, madam."</p>

<p>"Certain rules and regulations which you expect
your pupils to abide by, both as it pertains to the school,
and in reference to their moral conduct?"</p>

<p>"Most assuredly, madam."</p>

<!-- page 178 -->

<p>"If those terms are fully complied with, have you
any further claims upon them, their parents, or their
guardians?" continued Helen, with the most imperturbable
coolness.</p>

<p>"Most certainly not, madam," replied the professor,
bowing low.</p>

<p>"Upon these conditions, then, I will leave my son
here. I shall take care to fulfill my part of the contract;
and, if he fails in the duties assigned to him, send
him back to me, sir:" and, counting out the sum needed
for the first term of schooling, she placed it upon the
table beside him. He was about to transfer it to his
pocket, when she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"A receipt, sir, if you please."</p>

<p>"A receipt!" he exclaimed in astonishment.</p>

<p>"A receipt, sir. Would you trust that sum of money
with me without something to show in return?"</p>

<p>Without another word, the receipt was written and
handed to her.</p>

<p>"And now," said she, turning to Charles, "I have
no fears for you, my son, except in one respect; and I
think that love for your mother will make you strong
even there."</p>

<p>He understood her meaning, and replied, "For your
sake, dear mother."</p>

<p>For one moment the tears came into her eyes. She
took both his hands in hers, looked at him steadily for
some seconds: then, leaning forward, she pressed a kiss
upon his high, open forehead, another upon cheek and
lip; and, without another word, she was gone.</p>

<p>Prof. Wright was strongly impressed by this scene,
it was so different from the most of the partings

<!-- page 179 -->

he witnessed; and he felt, that, whatever of mystery
there might be about this woman's life, her boy had
been well taught, and would be an ornament to the
school.</p>

<p>He wondered, however, in what respect it was that
his mother feared for him: but he did not have to
wait a great while before being enlightened; not,
however, by any act on young Harlow's part, further
than a manifestation of patience under provocation
such as none but a noble nature could have borne.</p>

<div class="center" id="ch14">

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p class="small">JUST AS I EXPECTED.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p class="small">"The world is full of prophecies unthought of till the event occurs. We
fire the train, unheeding the result, then murmur when it comes; as though the
fates themselves had turned against us."&mdash;L. W.</p>

<br/>

<p>"READ that, will you," said Granger, tossing
a letter into his wife's lap.</p>

<p>"Just as I expected," was her reply,
as she glanced at the contents.</p>

<p>"Just what you ought to have expected
when you filled Herbert's head with your infernal
nonsense. If you had let the boy alone, he
would have done well enough."</p>

<p>"Mr. Granger, you haven't a particle of pride about
you. You would just as soon our son would make an
associate of that creature's boy as not; but I have more
regard for the family reputation, I can assure you."</p>

<p>"And a great deal it will add to the family reputation
to have Herbert sent home in disgrace," replied
Granger.</p>

<p>"But he shall not be: I will not submit to such an
injustice."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you are going to help yourself,
madam: if you put the devil into the boy's head, and
he acts it out, I can see no other way for you than to
accept the consequences."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, sir; but I'll find some way to help myself:

<!-- page 181 -->

that creature's boy shall never triumph over my
son, if I have to"&mdash;</p>

<p>"What? take his life, as you tried to his mother's?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger paled. "And she has told you that
absurd story?" she said.</p>

<p>"She has told me nothing, only what you heard yourself,
madam. I have known all about that little affair
of yours for years; and Mr. Reid and myself have
watched you too close to allow of its repetition; for we
did not think that it would add to the family reputation
to have one of its members dance upon the gallows for
the benefit of the public."</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger very conveniently fainted. It was the
best thing she could do under the circumstances. Her
husband, however, did not seem alarmed in the least,
but walked deliberately out of the room, leaving her to
recover as best she could. Unfeeling, was he? Perhaps;
and perhaps the faint was a feint. And remember,
dear reader, that people are not likely to be as patient
as saints, when reaping a crop of thistles, even though
they have sown the seed themselves.</p>

<p>The letter was from Prof. Wright, requesting them
to come for their son, as his conduct was such that he
could not be permitted to remain in the school.</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger, true to the petty pride of her nature,
as well as to gratify her spite toward Helen, had written
to Herbert, charging him not to associate with a boy by
the name of Harlow from Lakeside, as his mother was
a bad woman who had never been married. Her idea
was, that this fact, circulated amongst the boys, would
cause them to annoy Charles, till he would be provoked
into some overt act of impatience which would result in
his expulsion from the school.</p>

<!-- page 182 -->

<p>In this she was sadly mistaken; and the cup she had
prepared for another came home to herself. It was on
this very point that Helen had especially guarded
Charles.</p>

<p>She told him what he might expect from weak or
thoughtless minds, and also from malicious ones.
"And here," said she, "from the spirit in which you
meet this difficulty, shall I found my hopes of your
future. IF YOU CAN CONQUER HERE, YOU CAN CONQUER
EVERY THING." And, week by week, her letters to him
reiterated the same lesson; consequently, he was prepared
for the abuse to which he soon found himself subject.</p>

<p>But, armed with a mother's counsels and a mother's
love, it failed to elicit one retort or one act that was to
his disadvantage.</p>

<p>Still, he avoided the company of his tormentors when
he could, and frequently spent his hours of recreation in
the schoolroom. The professor noticed this, and determined
to learn the cause. He remembered the words,
"I have no fears for you, my son, except on one
point"&mdash;felt that this fact had some connection with
that point, whatever it was; and so he watched and
waited.</p>

<p>The school-building was so constructed, that, from one
of the upper rooms, one could see and hear all that was
passing in the playground without himself being seen.
Sometimes this room was occupied by one of the teachers,
and sometimes it was not; but the boys did not
know of its existence.</p>

<p>Hither the professor repaired, one day, just after the
recitation-hour.</p>

<!-- page 183 -->

<p>"Where is Harlow? Isn't he coming out?" asked
one of the better-disposed class of boys.</p>

<p>"Of course not: he's afraid we will say something to
him about his ma,&mdash;the bastard!" responded Granger.</p>

<p>"I say, Granger, it's too bad,&mdash;the way you treat that
boy," said another of the group.</p>

<p>"If you wish to associate with such as he, I am sure
I don't care; but I sha'n't. I should think more of him
if he had spunk enough to say a word for himself," was
Granger's sneering reply.</p>

<p>Prof. Wright was looked upon by many as a cold,
hard man, strictly just and uniformly kind, but more
from a sense of justice, from a desire to do right, than
from any genial feelings of love for humanity. But he
had a heart, and a warm one too, when it was once
reached; and Charles Harlow, with his open, honest
countenance, and his straightforward, respectful manner,
had won upon him more deeply than his pupils generally
did.</p>

<p>In a moment he realized the boy's position, knew
what the point was to which his mother had referred;
and his heart went out with almost a father's tenderness
toward the brave youth who was fighting so manfully
this the first battle of life. "I will put a stop to
this," said he to himself, as he descended to the schoolroom.</p>

<p>He found Charles sitting at his desk, with his face
buried in his hands. He looked up as the professor entered,
smiled, and, taking his book, went to studying.</p>

<p>"You work too hard, Mr. Harlow: you will break
down if you go on in this manner," said he, going forward,
and taking the book from the boy's hand. "And

<!-- page 184 -->

there is no need for it, I am sure; for there is not a pupil
in school who can learn faster than you can. Come,
now, go to the playground, where the rest are."</p>

Charles looked as though he would rather not: nevertheless,
he arose to his feet, and reached for his hat. "I
know more than you think I do; and I will stand your
friend," said the professor, noticing his hesitation.</p>

<p>This remark brought the tears; but, dashing them
aside, he hastened from the room. The professor looked
after him a moment, and then returned to his place of
reconnoissance.</p>

<p>"Here comes mamma's boy. I wonder where his papa
is?" were the first words that greeted his ears.</p>

<p>"Shame, shame, Granger!" said two or three voices
in that half-earnest, half-wavering tone which only provokes
to further demonstration.</p>

<p>"Will he tell us where his papa is?" continued
Granger in the same insulting tones.</p>

<p>Charles walked directly up to where he was standing,
and looked him squarely in the face. Herbert did not
quite relish this, for the mean are always cowardly.</p>

<p>He stepped back a little, and said "None of your impudence,
my lad!"</p>

<p>"You asked me about my father," replied Charles.</p>

<p>"I did, my man, and should be happy to learn something
of that mythical personage."</p>

<p>"And you really wish me to tell you?" he continued.</p>

<p>"Of course I do: what are you waiting for?"</p>

<p>"Boys, you hear what he says," said Charles, turning
to the crowd.</p>

<p>"What's the fool coming at?" exclaimed Herbert in
a tone of derision.</p>

<!-- page 185 -->

<p>"I wish to know positively if you would like to
hear the name of my father; and, as you say you
would, I will tell you. It is Edward Granger of Albright."</p>

<p>Had he been struck by a cannon-ball, Herbert Granger
could not have been more completely stunned than
he was by this announcement. He turned pale and red
by turns, opened his lips as if to speak, then shut them
again; and, but for the suppressed titter that ran
through the group standing around, I do not know but
he would have fainted. This aroused his anger; and,
springing quickly forward, he dealt Charles a blow
between the eyes which knocked him prostrate, with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take that, you lying son of a b&mdash;h!" and was
about to spring upon him, without giving him a chance
to rise, when he was caught by the arm and held back
by some of the larger boys.</p>

<p>Charles arose, and quietly wiped the blood from his
face; remarking, as he did so, "You only got what you
asked for, sir."</p>

<p>"It's a lie, you brat of a b&mdash;h!" yelled Herbert,
struggling to free himself from those who held him.</p>

<p>"It isn't a lie neither," said little Henry Sherwood.
"They look so much alike, anybody might know they
were brothers."</p>

<p>Henry was from Lakeside, and, knowing Charles, had
sympathized with him all along; but, like a great many
older people in similar circumstances, he had not the
courage to say so till he saw that the tide was turning.</p>

<p>"That's so; that's so! They do look alike, and that's
a fact," echoed half a dozen voices at once.</p>

<p>"Only Charles is the handsomest," continued Henry
Sherwood.</p>

<!-- page 186 -->

<p>Herbert was beside himself with rage. He tore himself
free; and, catching up a heavy ball-club that was
lying near, he was about to use it right and left, when
the voice of Prof. Wright, asking, "Boys, what does this
mean?" put a stop to further proceedings.</p>

<p>Herbert dropped his club and his head at the same
time, while Charles looked boldly up. The professor
smiled, as if to say, "All right, my boy;" while one of
the older boys commenced giving an outline of the
causes which had led to the disturbance.</p>

<p>But he was interrupted with "Never mind, Mr.
Swain: I saw and heard it all. Mr. Granger, will you
come with me?" Herbert followed with a quaking
heart; while Charles, for the first time since Herbert's
first letter from his mother after his arrival in Springville,&mdash;for
the first time since then, enjoyed his hour with
his school-fellows without being subjected to insult.</p>

<p>Prof. Wright led young Granger to his study,&mdash;the
room facetiously called by the boys "the court-room."
Placing him a chair, and seating himself in another, he
asked in no very gentle tones,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And now, Mr. Granger, will you be good enough
to tell me what all this means?"</p>

<p>Herbert's temper was up, and with it the pride of the
Wards; still, he was a little afraid of the stern old man
before him. "He insulted me," was the dogged reply,
after a little hesitation.</p>

<p>"A little more respectful, if you please. How did
he insult you?"</p>

<p>"I would rather not tell, sir."</p>

<p>"But I command you to tell, young man."</p>

<p>Herbert looked up. There was no relenting on that

<!-- page 187 -->

stern face. "He spoke disrespectfully of my father,
sir."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"He&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I do not wish to tell you, sir."</p>

<p>"It is not as you wish, but as I wish."</p>

<p>"He&mdash;I will not tell: so there!" exclaimed Herbert
in sheer desperation.</p>

"You will not leave this room till you do," said the
professor, rising, and turning the key in the lock, and
then transferring it to his pocket. "Now, young man, I
await your convenience. There are just ten minutes
before the next recitation commences; if you tell me in
that time, well; if not, you will be detained here for at
least three hours, before you will have the opportunity;"
and, taking his watch, he laid it down where Herbert
could mark the time.</p>

<p>One, two, three minutes passed, and no sound was
heard but the ticking of the little monitor; and another
minute: and then, with a desperate effort, Herbert managed
to say, "Harlow's mother was never married."</p>

<p>"Is he to blame for that?" asked the professor.</p>

<p>"But he told me that my father was his."</p>

<p>"What did you say to him that caused him to say
it."</p>

<p>"My mother told me that I was not to associate with
such as he."</p>

<p>"That is not answering my question, Mr. Granger."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I told him I should like to know where his
papa was."</p>

<p>"And then knocked him down for telling you."</p>

<p>"Mr. Wright!"</p>

<p>"Is it not so, young man?"</p>

<!-- page 188 -->

<p>"But you do not, you can not believe that he told the
truth, sir!"</p>

<p>"I do not know as to that, sir; but I can hardly
think Mr. Harlow capable of telling what he does not
believe to be true. And, according to your own statement,
you insulted him. I have ample proof of this,
even if you had attempted to falsify, which I am glad
that you did not; for I heard every thing that was said.
Go to your room now; and this evening I will settle
this matter with you."</p>

<p>Herbert was only too glad to retire; but he spent the
balance of the day in nursing his wrath, and writing a
pitiful account of his wrongs to his mother, instead of
cultivating a spirit that was likely to reconcile the difference
between himself and the unyielding professor.
Consequently, when he was required to apologize to
Charles before the school, he positively refused to obey.</p>

<p>"Just as you can afford, Mr. Granger; but you will
be expelled from the school if you do not."</p>

<p>"I have written to my mother, sir, and she will see
that I have justice done me," was the sullen reply.
Prof. Wright turned and left him without another
word; but went directly to his room, and wrote the
letter to which we have referred in the commencement
of this chapter.</p>

<p>Herbert's letter was already in Mrs. Granger's possession
when the professor's letter reached Albright;
but she had concealed the fact from her husband,
hoping, by some means, to settle the difficulty without
its coming to his knowledge. She well knew, that, if
she had kept quiet herself, this would never have occurred:
but, in her overweening pride, she had taken a

<!-- page 189 -->

step that had made the parentage of Helen's son known
to the whole school; and she inwardly cursed herself for
the folly that had produced so undesirable a result.</p>

<p>In fact, she had overreached herself; and she knew
it, but was far too proud to acknowledge it. All
night long, the night previous, she had lain awake
studying over the matter, trying to decide what course
it was best to take to save the family reputation from
further blight; and now she was confronted with this
letter, requesting them to come and bring their son
home.</p>

<p>What should be done? What would the people of
Albright say if they knew the facts? They must
not know it! But how could she prevent it? There
were pupils at Springville not only from Albright, but
from Lakeside, Glencove, and all the country round.
There was no help for the matter, as she could see.
The world would not only know that her husband was
the father of Helen Harlow's child,&mdash;not only this,
but that her own son had been expelled from the
school in which the other was retained with honor.</p>

<p>It was a bitter cup for the proud woman; but she
had prepared it, and she was obliged to drink it. She
would have taken the lives of these she hated so intensely;
but the failure of her first scheme, together
with the so recent remarks of Granger,&mdash;these made
her fear to attempt such a thing.</p>

<p>She went to Springville, had a stormy interview with
the professor, making things worse instead of better;
took her son, and placed him in another school, and then
went home, saying, "It is just as I expected: the men
are all alike. A creature like that is always favored."</p>

<!-- page 190 -->

<p>"A creature like what?" asked Granger.</p>

<p>"You know well enough who I mean, sir. Not only
such, but their children, born of shame, will find favor
with the very best of men, when a child honestly born
must stand aside. Oh the wickedness of this ungodly
world!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you had better turn saint, and go into a
convent," said Granger.</p>

<p>"So that you could marry your mistress!" she retorted.
"No, Edward Granger! my children shall
never be disgraced like that. I would rise from my
grave to prevent it."</p>

<p>"That is easier said than done," he replied; leaving
the room at the same time, to avoid further conflict.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>

<p class="small">EMENDATORE.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p class="small">"A bubbling spring lies at your feet: you heed it not. It sinks from sight, and,
flowing underground, comes forth to meet more genial light elsewhere. You
learn its fame; go look upon, then quaff its crystal waves, and wonder whence
it came."&mdash;L. W.</p>

<br/>

<p>CHARLES HARLOW had no further
trouble at Springville. The battle was
fought, and the victory won,&mdash;a battle
which called for greater courage than is
needed on the tented field. The boy who
can control himself needs fear nothing else. Boys instinctively
recognize this, though slow to act upon it; but,
when they see such a spirit manifested, they are sure to
respect it. Granger, on the contrary, having provoked
his own trouble, met with little sympathy, even from
those who were the most ready to join with him when
the tide was in his favor.</p>

<p>It is a hard lesson, but one that all must learn, soon
or late,&mdash;that those who give the most boisterous demonstrations
of approval are not likely to be the truest of
friends. And it were well to understand the opposite
also,&mdash;that those who are loudest in condemnation are
not always our worst enemies.</p>

<p>As Charles is now pleasantly situated,&mdash;the first in his
classes, and a favorite with both teacher and pupils,&mdash;we

<!-- page 192 -->

will return to Lakeside for a while. Helen kept for
sale, among other things, the popular periodicals and
weeklies of the day. About this time there appeared,
first in one of these, and then in another, an article,
signed "Emendatore," about which every one seemed
running wild.</p>

<p>"Who is the writer?" "Is it a man's or a woman's
style?" "What is the meaning of the signature?"
&amp;c., were the questions that flew from lip to lip.</p>

<p>"Miss Harlow, have you read the article in 'The
Waverley' of this week, signed 'Emendatore'?"</p>

<p>"I have been so busy this week, that I have had but
little time to read," was the quiet reply.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you ought to read that! It's perfectly
splendid!" This from a young miss; and the next
hour, perhaps,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Helen, have you read the article in last week's
'Ledger,' signed 'Emendatore'?" would be asked by
some staid matron who "never read stories," but who
had been persuaded to read this, "because everybody
was talking about it."</p>

<p>"I have heard it spoken of, Mrs. Coburn, but do not
get time to read as much as I would like."</p>

<p>"But you must take time to read this: it is well
worth it, I can assure you. If all stories were like it, I
should not object to them as I do."</p>

<p>The next week, Mr. and Mrs. Gordon call in, on
their way to visit a friend in the country; and the first
question after they are fairly seated is, "Helen, have you
read the story in this week's 'Harper,' signed 'Emendatore'?"</p>

<p>"I just glanced at it, last evening, but was interrupted
by a customer."</p>

<!-- page 193 -->

<p>"Well, you must read that, if you never read another
thing of the kind," said Mr. Gordon.</p>

<p>"What do you think husband said when he first read
it?" asked Mrs. Gordon.</p>

<p>"I am sure I cannot tell," replied Helen. "I am not
good at guessing."</p>

<p>"Wife!" said Mr. Gordon, shaking his finger at her
threateningly.</p>

<p>"Oh! I am not afraid of you, sir," said she, laughing.
"Enforce your authority if you can."</p>

<p>"It is not of much use to try to enforce any thing
in these degenerate days," he replied, with assumed
gravity.</p>

<p>"But you have not told me what he said," remarked
Helen.</p>

<p>"He said, that, if you ever did such things, he should
think that you were 'Emendatore.'"</p>

<p>"I am not at all surprised that he did not wish you
to tell me that he had made so unreasonable a supposition."</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon cast a searching look upon Helen, but
read nothing; and, turning away with an expression of
disappointment upon his face, said to himself, "It can
not be; but it is so like her."</p>

<p>"I told husband," continued Mrs. Gordon, "that you
would laugh at him. But I should really like to know
the author of that article."</p>

<p>"Authoress, you mean," responded her husband.</p>

<p>"I can't see, for my part, Mr. Gordon, how you can
think so; for, certainly, it is not a woman's style. It is
too strong and vigorous."</p>

<p>"It is strong and vigorous, I will own, wife; but it is

<!-- page 194 -->

not masculine. None but a woman who had suffered
and grown strong could have brought out those fine,
delicate touches of feeling."</p>

<p>"I think I must read it myself," said Helen.</p>

<p>"Oh, do! and, when we return, we will hear your
decision; for I am sure you will agree with me."</p>

<p>"Of course she will, wife," laughed Mr. Gordon.</p>

<p>"I do not think, under the circumstances, that I
shall give you my decision, even if I conclude that I am
capable of deciding: for if I agree with you, Mrs. Gordon,
I shall bring down the concentrated wrath of your
liege lord upon my devoted head; and if with him, there
is danger of provoking you to jealousy."</p>

<p>"Just like a woman: politic enough to get out of a
thing, if you do not wish to do it."</p>

<p>"I am a woman, Mr. Gordon; and why shouldn't I
be just like one?" asked Helen very demurely.</p>

<p>"You are just like yourself, that is certain," replied
he.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew who 'Emendatore' was," said the
lady, "for"&mdash;</p>

<p>"If only for the purpose of learning whether man or
woman, I presume," interrupted Mr. Gordon.</p>

<p>"I think," said Helen, "that it makes but little difference
as to that. It is <i>what</i>, not <i>who</i>."</p>

<p>"True, true; but then one has some curiosity, you
know."</p>

<p>"You mean, wife, that a woman has. Eve had,
'<i>you know</i>.' But here comes Mrs. Sherwood."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sherwood's opinion of Helen has changed somewhat
since we saw her last, and she is now one of her
best friends. Henry had written to his mother an

<!-- page 195 -->

account of the scene between Charles Harlow and
Herbert Granger, at Springville. The secret of
Charles's parentage was, therefore, no longer a secret
at Lakeside; and to say that Mrs. Sherwood was somewhat
amused and very much gratified by the manner
in which Charles had sustained himself would simply
be speaking the truth.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Helen. Glad to meet you, Mr.
and Mrs. Gordon. What beautiful weather we are
having!"</p>

<p>"Very fine for the time of year. How is your family,
Mrs. Sherwood?" replied Mr. Gordon.</p>

<p>"Never better. But have you read the articles that
have appeared recently, signed 'Emendatore,' Mrs.
Gordon?"</p>

<p>"Just what we were talking about when you came
in. Did you ever read any thing like them?"</p>

<p>"I never did. How they go right home to one's
heart! I hope, if ever the writer publishes a book, that
Helen will have them for sale; for it would certainly
pay her well. Have you any thing further from
'Emendatore,' Helen?"</p>

<p>"There is a short story in 'Harper;' but I don't
believe I have a copy left, Mrs. Sherwood."</p>

<p>It was thus that "Emendatore" was everywhere
received. But, though public expectation stood on
tiptoe, the writer remained <i>incognito</i>&mdash;the secret of
identity impenetrable.</p>

<br/>

<p>About six months after the above conversation, a
clairvoyant who was interested in following up this
question might have seen a woman in the office of a

<!-- page 196 -->

Boston publisher, with a manuscript in hand, consulting
with the head of the firm in reference to its publication
in book-form.</p>

<p>"How much will you take for your manuscript?"
asked the publisher.</p>

<p>"I do not wish to dispose of it, sir."</p>

<p>"It costs quite a sum, madam, to get a book fairly
before the public, especially if the writer is unknown."</p>

<p>"I am aware of it, sir; but I prefer to publish upon
my own responsibility. Then no one loses but myself,
if it is a failure; and, if it is a success, I have the benefit
of it."</p>

<p>"Under what name do you come before the public?&mdash;your
own, or shall you use a <i>nom de plume?</i>"</p>

<p>"Emendatore."</p>

<p>"Emendatore!" he exclaimed, starting to his feet
in his astonishment. "Are you the writer of the
articles that have recently appeared under that signature?"</p>

<p>"I believe I am."</p>

<p>"And you will not sell your manuscript on any
terms?"</p>

<p>"I should rather not."</p>

<p>That "rather not" meant much more than a positive
refusal would have done from some; and the gentleman
knew it: still, he did not like to give up the
point. "I will pay you handsomely for it," he said.</p>

<p>The lady shook her head.</p>

<p>"I think you stand in the way of your own interest,
madam."</p>

<p>"I shall not dispose of the manuscript upon any
terms," she replied, finding that nothing but a positive
refusal would do.</p>

<!-- page 197 -->

<p>"Of course, I do not wish to urge you, and I have
no doubt but your book will be a success: still, when
publishers take the responsibility of a book, it has more
weight with the reading-public than one which is put
forth by individual enterprise, from the fact that the
former are supposed to understand the merits of a
work; whereas the latter are liable to be partial,&mdash;are
less qualified to judge independently of what they
desire to be true."</p>

<p>"I acknowledge the justness of your remarks, sir,
but prefer to venture alone."</p>

<p>"I hope, then, madam, that you will permit us to be
your publishers."</p>

<p>"I shall have no objection to that, provided that you
will do as well by me as I can do elsewhere."</p>

<br/>

<p>"Miss Harlow, have you seen the announcement?"</p>

<p>"To what announcement do you refer. Miss Mary?"</p>

<p>" 'Emendatore's' book. I want you to send for a
copy for me."</p>

<p>"Certainly I will."</p>

<p>"I think. Miss Harlow, that you had better order
several, while you are sending; for I know that you can
sell them."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Miss Mary, the book may not be as good
as the short articles are."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is; for Mrs. Fitzhammer was up to Albright
yesterday, and she says that Mr. Granger has a copy.
He has just come home from Boston; and he brought it
with him. Well, Mrs. Granger sat up till far into the
night to finish it. She is in raptures over it; says that
she would give any thing to be acquainted with the
writer."</p>

<!-- page 198 -->

<p>"And what does Mr. Granger say?" asked Helen.</p>

<p>"They say he only laughs at her enthusiasm, and
tells her that the writer, he presumes, does not look nor
act so very different from other people."</p>

<p>"I presume they do not," said Helen with a smile.</p>

<p>"How can you say so. Miss Harlow? For my part,
I think that they must be perfectly grand. How I
should like to see a live author! But here comes Mrs.
Fitzhammer herself."</p>

<p>It was a fact; the lawyer's wife, after all these
years, had condescended to enter Helen Harlow's place
of business. Helen bowed; but the lady took no
notice of the salutation, but, in the tone of one ordering
an inferior, said, "I wish you to order a half-dozen
copies of a popular work recently published by Blank
&amp; Co., Boston. 'Emendatore' is the name of the
author. The title of the book I have forgotten; but
you will find a notice of it in the last 'Harper.' "</p>

<p>"I am about to order a supply, and you can have as
many as you wish, madam," replied Helen.</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Fitzhammer, what do you want of so
many?" asked Mary Holmes, opening her blue eyes
wider than ever.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Mary! you here? I did not see you.
How is your mother?"</p>

<p>"She is well. But you did not tell me what you were
going to do with so many copies of 'Emendatore's'
book?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know, Puss, that the holidays are coming?"</p>

<p>"So they are. I didn't think of that; and, if I
thought Santa Claus would remember me in that
shape, I wouldn't send for one."</p>

<!-- page 199 -->

<p>"Santa Claus will be pretty certain to remember you
in some shape," was Mrs. Fitzhammer's flattering
answer. "But, come; are you not going home? I
shall pass right by your house, and shall be happy to
have your company."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I can't go yet. Mother said that I
might stay till eleven o'clock with Miss Harlow; and it
lacks more than an hour of that time."</p>

<p>The lawyer's wife looked sober, and was saying
something about its not being proper for young girls to
be standing around in shops, but was cut short with&mdash;</p>

<p>"I guess my mother knows what's proper for me,
Mrs. Fitzhammer."</p>

<p>"Of course; of course she does, Miss Mary. I did
not intend any reflection upon her. Give her my respects,
will you? Good-morning."</p>

<p>"The proud fool! How I hate her!" said young
Miss America, as soon as she was out of hearing.</p>

<p>"You should not call names, nor hate any one, my
dear," said Helen mildly.</p>

<p>"But I do hate her, Miss Harlow. She thinks,
because my father is rich, and can give her Fitzhammer
of a husband plenty of business, that she must be
very polite to me. But how did she treat you? I've
got eyes, and can see how things go; and Mary Holmes
knows who she likes, and who she don't like; and
Mary Holmes's mother knows what is proper for her
daughter, as well as Mrs. Fitz does."</p>

<p>Helen tried to frown down this burst of "free
speech;" but it was of no use, the indignant girl
would have her say.</p>

<p>Helen turned, at this point, to wait upon customers.

<!-- page 200 -->

and there was silence for a few minutes; but, as soon
as they were gone, the girl commenced again: "Six
copies of 'Emendatore's' book! How very grand,
indeed! Couldn't remember the title, but you would
find it in the last 'Harper'!"</p>

<p>"Mary, hush!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will. Miss Harlow. But what is the title
of that book? I am like Mrs. Fitz; I have forgotten
too."</p>

<p>" 'Trial and Triumph,' isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! that's it. I'll try and remember it now."</p>

<p>Helen sent for a supply of the wonderful book; and
it had a large sale in that vicinity. But who was the
author? That was the question which remained unanswered.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>

<p class="small">THE WICKEDNESS OF THE WICKED.</p>

<br/>

<p class="small">"If you bray a fool in a mortar with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness
depart from him."&mdash;BIBLE.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>IF the idea of doing an evil act once takes
possession of the human soul, it seems as
if it was almost impossible to eradicate it,
till experiment after experiment has demonstrated
its utter folly. Mrs. Granger
had never given up her purpose of injuring Helen in
some way; and now, since the affair at Springville,
which had resulted so disastrously to her hopes, that
desire had been increased tenfold.</p>

<p>But how to proceed without being detected,&mdash;that
was the question: a question that she found herself unable
to solve; and, the more she pondered it, the more
difficult it became. But persevering thought will bring
its results here as well as elsewhere; and she finally
fixed upon a plan that seemed feasible,&mdash;a plan by
means of which she could injure her in her property,
if not in her person; and she hoped to in both.</p>

<p>It seems incredible, almost, that a woman, one who
stood well in society, was a wife and a mother, one
who had listened all her life to the preached gospel,&mdash;it
seems hard, I say, for the common masses of the

<!-- page 202 -->

people to realize that such a one could be guilty of
such deliberate wickedness. But Mrs. Granger's hatred
to Helen and her boy amounted almost to monomania;
and when it is remembered that her ruling idea from
childhood up had been family pride, and that Helen
with her son was a living evidence against the immaculateness
of its record, it will not be so much wondered
at, and more especially if one comes to understand
the psychological power of an idea, when it once gets
control of the mind,&mdash;how all else must yield to its
sway.</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger knew that Charles would be at home
during the summer vacation. Albright was at least
twenty miles from Lakeside: therefore, it was out of
the question to think of going there and returning the
same night. But some two and a half miles from
Lakeside was what was called "Blueberry Mountain,"&mdash;a
place of resort for parties from a distance, who used
to visit it during the berry season; bringing a tent and
cooking utensils, and stopping, perhaps, three or four
days,&mdash;a kind of picnic, or summer recreation, the
fruit serving more as an excuse to bring people together
than any thing else.</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger resolved to join one of these parties,
and, though so near Cousin Fitzhammer's, to stay upon
the ground just for the novelty of the thing; and,
whatever might occur, who would suspect her of going
through the woods down the side of the mountain,
alone and on foot, for that distance?</p>

<p>With the most diabolical perseverance she experimented
for weeks, yes, months, with a slow match;
testing its certainty, and the length of time that might

<!-- page 203 -->

be made to elapse between ignition and explosion, if a
train of powder was properly laid. During this time,
Ward, her second son, was heard frequently to complain
how fast his powder disappeared; but his mother only
laughed at him, telling him that boys never realized
how much powder and shot they wasted when they
once became fascinated with a gun.</p>

<p>"But, mother, it is not my shot; that holds out well
enough: but my powder is gone before I know it; and
father will think that I hunt all the time, I am afraid."</p>

<p>"Well, here is some money to get you some more
powder; and see that you take good care of it this
time."</p>

<p>Ward took the money, wondering at his mother's
unusual generosity, and hastened away to make his
purchase. This time he filled his powder-horn, and
laid the rest away very carefully upon an upper shelf
in the closet in his room. A few days afterward, his
mother said to him, "Ward, where did you put your
powder?"</p>

<p>"On the upper shelf in my room."</p>

<p>"Did you leave it in the paper?"</p>

<p>"A part of it. Why?"</p>

<p>"Come with me, and I will show you."</p>

<p>He followed, as desired, and found a hole in his
powder-paper, and nearly all the powder gone. "What
does this mean, mother?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Don't you see," she said, "that this shelf goes
back farther than the others, and that there is a hole in
it leading down between the plastering and the outside
of the building?"</p>

<p>"So there is; and it looks just as if it was made on
purpose."</p>

<!-- page 204 -->

<p>"Nonsense, my son: I have only been making it a
little larger, so as to put down some poison for the
mice."</p>

<p>"It's the mice, then, that have been after my
powder?"</p>

<p>"They have, probably, been gnawing the paper.
They use old paper and rags, which they cut up with
their teeth, to make their nests of."</p>

<p>"But, mother, I did not lay the paper there, but
here in this corner."</p>

<p>"They dragged it there, I presume."</p>

<p>"But, how could they do it without scattering the
powder?"</p>

<p>"They didn't: I have cleaned it up."</p>

<p>"Well, I must say that they are cunning little
wretches to turn that paper in such shape that one hole
will just match the other, and let my powder all down
behind the plastering. If they should take a notion to
carry a match down there, they could blow us up."</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger laughed. "So they might, Ward: I
did not think of that. Go and get me a cup of water;
and I will turn it down there, and spoil their fun by
wetting the powder."</p>

<p>"Guess it wouldn't be much fun for them, any more
than for us," said Ward, as he trudged away after the
water.</p>

<p>"Ward," said she, on his return, "you need not
say any thing to your father about this: for it might
worry him; and there is no danger."</p>

<p>Ward did not say any thing to his father about it:
but he told the Irish girl in the kitchen, and she went
to "the master" with it; for "sure, and she wasn't
going to stay there and be blowed to smitherins."</p>

<!-- page 205 -->

Granger asked his wife what it meant. "Only
some of Ward's nonsense about some powder he
spilled. I will go and pacify Margy;" and he thought
nothing further of the matter then. But he remembered
it afterward.</p>

<p>The time arrived for blueberry-parties, and Mrs.
Granger declared her intention of going. She hadn't
been since she was a girl; and she was going to try it
this year, just for the fun of the thing. "I don't
expect that you will want to go, Mr. Granger, and I
don't ask it; but I shall go."</p>

<p>"A very polite way of telling me that you don't
want me along, madam; but that makes no difference.
If you don't get sick, I shall not care," he replied.</p>

<p>"And much you would care if I did, if I was only
sick enough to die!" she retorted.</p>

<p>"So far as that is concerned, I would a little rather
that my children would not be deprived of a mother
just yet. It matters not as to myself," was his cool
reply.</p>

<p>"Of course not, so long as that creature lives," she
was about to say, but checked herself in time; for she
did not wish to turn his thoughts in that direction just
then. As though it needed her bitter words to make
him think of Helen!</p>

<p>"Rather hard language from a man to his wife!"
she said, as soon as she could command herself enough
to speak calmly.</p>

<p>He looked up quickly, caught the expression of
malignity upon her face, and said to himself, "There
is mischief on foot somewhere." But he gave no
answer.</p>

<!-- page 206 -->

<p>After a few minutes' silence, she continued: "I
would rather you would go too, Edward; but I had no
idea that you would, if I asked you."</p>

<p>"Mischief!" said he again, to himself; but, aloud,
"I can not, Mrs. Granger: I have business that will
not permit of it."</p>

<p>Strange efforts at concealment will reveal themselves.
The very attempt only draws attention to the fact
that there is something hidden; and this once known,
it is half discovered.</p>

<p>Tuesday morning opened clear and bright, and our
party set out on their excursion in high spirits. Two
nights they were to be out, and return on Thursday to
Albright, with fruit enough to make their fortunes, as
they laughingly said. They reached the mountain about
the middle of the afternoon; and with pitching their
tents, and gathering berries enough for their suppers, the
time was employed till it was too late to do any thing
further that night. Mrs. Granger had induced them to
camp pretty well down toward the village; "For, if we
get sick of the fun, we can get up and go to the public-house,"
she said.</p>

<p>This done, she had rambled about till she found the
path which led directly thither,&mdash;the one followed by
the children who came from Lakeside to gather the
tempting fruit.</p>

<p>She made no further attempt the first night, but
retired very early; saying that she wished to get well
rested for the next day. It was little that she slept,
however; for her mind was too much occupied with
thoughts of the deed she meditated.</p>

<p>The following day waned slowly. Toward evening,

a party from Lakeside, Mrs. Fitzhammer amongst the
number, visited them; and that lady was urgent in her
entreaties that "Cousin Ella should go and spend the
night with her, instead of staying out there in that
horrid place." But "Cousin Ella" only laughed at
her, persistently refusing to comply with her request.</p>

<p>The sun set grandly; and the stars shone as bright
as though sin had never entered the hearts of men and
women. The last of the party had retired, and were
sleeping even more soundly than usual, from the effects
of the day's fatigue, when a masked figure stole forth,
and made its way swiftly toward the village.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Granger kept thinking of his
wife's unusual mood; and, the more he thought, the
more troubled he became. Something was wrong
somewhere, he was quite certain. All at once her
close proximity to Helen flashed upon his mind, in connection
with the former attempt to burn her out.</p>

<p>"My God!" he exclaimed: "why did I not think
of this before?" and, saddling his best horse, he was
soon on his way to Lakeside. It was about ten o'clock
on the second night of Mrs. Granger's absence from
Albright, that a solitary horseman dismounted near the
now deserted house in which Mrs. Harlow had died.
Leading the animal to the rear of the building, he
made it fast to a post; and, taking out his watch, he
struck a match and looked at the hour.</p>

<p>"Too soon for her to commence operations yet.
Perhaps she has no such intention; but it will do no
harm to watch." And, proceeding to the village, he
concealed himself where he could watch the approaches
to Helen Harlow's place of residence.</p>

<!-- page 208 -->

<p>An hour or more had elapsed, when a figure so
clothed that he could not tell whether it was a man's or
a woman's approached stealthily. Granger's heart
beat high; for it was he, as the reader must have
already divined. Upon nearer approach, he perceived
that the figure was masked. "Not so deeply masked
but your deviltry is discerned," muttered he between
his set teeth.</p>

<p>Still closer came the figure. It was now so hidden
by the shadow of the building, that only its outlines
could be seen. A window is tried, one that leads
into the kitchen; and it is not fastened. Up, up, very
slowly, till it has reached the height of about six inches.
"You are getting yourself into a nice trap," thought
the watcher.</p>

<p>But no; the figure does not enter the window: it is
fastened open, however, by placing a little stick under
it. Something is thrown into the room, and then a line
attached to some light fabric pushed in after it. The
watcher is trembling in every limb with the intensity
of his excitement; but he still restrained himself. This
line was now carried along close to the side of the house
for several feet, and ignited with a match.</p>

<p>"Devil!" muttered Granger to himself: "what an
exchange I made when I married you instead of
Helen!" For he had no doubt, by this time, as to
the identity of the figure.</p>

<p>This done, the form walked perhaps twenty feet, in
an unconcerned manner, away from the building,&mdash;far
enough to enter the shadow of the next one,&mdash;and
then made a quick movement as if about to run; but
sprang suddenly back, threw up its hands, and uttered

<!-- page 209 -->

a suppressed scream, with the words, "My God,
Elda!" then, as if doubly frightened, it sped away with
the swiftness of a deer. Granger, in the mean time,
distinctly saw a figure in white glide along toward the
raised window, and disappear directly under it.</p>

<p>"If I believed in ghosts, I should say that was one,"
was his inward comment; and then he proceeded to
examine the train that had been laid. He extinguished
the fire, gathered up the tarred line and put it into
his pocket, but concluded to leave the balance of the
preparation that had been made for the destruction of
the building just as it was, that Helen might see for
herself what had been done. Then he started for his
horse; but he had not proceeded more than half the
distance, when a sound like an explosion caused him to
turn hastily back.</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger heard it too; and, notwithstanding her
fright at seeing what she took to be Elda Ransom's
ghost, she exulted in what she supposed to be the success
of her plan. "Nothing strange," thought she,
"that Elda Ransom's ghost should watch Helen Harlow's
house. Like attracts like, it is said; and we
know that such as she can not find rest in heaven, if
Mr. Gordon did preach such a splendid sermon over
her remains." But these reflections did not tend to
check her speed in the least; for she could not feel that
she was safe till back within her tent.</p>

<p>She reached it without interruption, and flattered
herself that this time, at least, she had been successful.
"I don't care what Mr. Granger or Mr. Reid may
<i>think</i>: they have no proof."</p>

<p>A man who had failed in some undertaking once

<!-- page 210 -->

said, "that if his forethoughts were as good as his
afterthoughts, he could cheat the Devil;" and how
certain it is, that, for want of the requisite knowledge,
our "best-laid plans," either for good or evil, fail
just at the point where we are the most anxious for
success! Had Mrs. Granger carried out her plans
twenty-four hours sooner, or had Helen been a little
less tender-hearted, and refused to sit up at least half
the night with Patrick Donahoe's sick child, things
would have gone far more to the liking of that revengeful
personage than they did.</p>

<p>Helen had taken Charles with her, intending to
return about midnight or a little after. There was a
little room off the kitchen, in which black Susan usually
slept. Helen occupied the chamber over the kitchen.
There were two beds in this chamber, with a half-partition
between; and, when Charles was at home, he slept
in one of these, and his mother in the other.</p>

<p>The package thrown into the window when it was
first raised was powder, which had a slow match attached
to it also; but it was prepared in such a manner
that Granger had not discovered it. Indeed, he
never thought of looking for more than one; for he had
not imagined a diabolism that could thus plan to be
doubly sure. Black Susan was lying on the lounge in
the front shop, having gone there and lain down with
no intention of remaining; but, sleep overtaking her, she
was still there when the explosion took place. Consequently,
there was no one injured personally, though
there was considerable damage done to the house and
furniture.</p>

<p>The package had been planned with all the cunning

<!-- page 211 -->

of a fiend. Some three or four iron spikes were found
scattered in different directions,&mdash;one passing up through
the floor and lodging in Helen's bed; another tearing
its way into Susan's room; and still another into the
shop amongst the light material there.</p>

<p>"The Lord did it, that's sartain," said Susan.</p>

<p>"Did what, Susan?"</p>

<p>"Sent Miss Helen and Master Charles away; and
made dis ole black body forget itsel', and go to sleep on
Miss Helen's lounge. That am sure."</p>

<p>Helen and Charles were within a few feet of the
house, on their way home from watching with the sick
child, when the explosion took place; consequently,
were able to prevent the spread of the flames: otherwise,
the house must have been consumed.</p>

<p>Granger, when he came in sight, saw both Helen
and Charles moving about, and others upon the spot,
ready to render whatever assistance was needed. Seeing
this, he retired without making his presence known;
for he did not wish Helen to know of his being in the
vicinity. But, instead of returning directly to Albright,
as he had first intended, he took the path that led to
the mountain.</p>

<p>He rode on till he came in sight of the place where
the party from Albright were camped, and then dismounted
for the purpose of reconnoitering. He had
gone but a few steps when he saw his wife come from
a thick cluster of bushes at the left, and enter the
tent. He stopped short till she had disappeared within;
and then went directly to this clump of bushes, and
began to search for the disguise she had worn an hour
previous. He first struck a match, and glanced around

<!-- page 212 -->

to see what he could discover; and, finding a pine-knot
filled with turpentine, he lit another match, and still
another; and finally succeeded in setting the knot on
fire. With this he searched the place thoroughly, and
was at length rewarded by finding what he sought.</p>

<p>It was now nearly two o'clock in the morning, and it
would be impossible for him to reach Albright before
the family were up. Reid was living some ten
miles from Lakeside, and at least four miles from
his direct route home; but thither he resolved to go.
He reached the place a little after daylight. Calling
Reid up, for he had not yet risen, he told him all that
had occurred, and asked his advice as to what course it
was best to take.</p>

<p>"You can not expose her," said Reid, "because of
your children."</p>

<p>"I know," said Granger, "that they must be saved
this disgrace if possible; but how can I continue to live
in the same house with such a demon?"</p>

<p>"It is a hard case, Ed, and I don't know what to advise,"
replied Reid thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Have you seen Helen lately?" asked Granger.</p>

<p>"Not very lately: why?"</p>

<p>"Do you know any thing of the history of the girl who
died there a year or two since?"</p>

<p>"Elda Ransom, do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the name;" and Granger went on to
relate the scene at Job Jenkins's: and Reid, in turn, told
him Elda's story as he had heard it from Helen.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see her?"</p>

<p>"Once, in Boston, some years since. A friend pointed
her out to me upon the street."</p>

<!-- page 213 -->

<p>"Describe her," said Granger. Reid did so, adding,
"She was very beautiful; and I remember feeling sad
at the thought of one so lovely living such a life."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder she was frightened."</p>

<p>Reid looked up inquiringly, and Granger related to
him what he had seen. "The very person you have
described; and I am certain she saw her; for, if I am not
very much mistaken, Elda is the name she called as she
started back."</p>

<p>"I didn't know as you believed in ghosts, Ed."</p>

<p>"I cannot help believing what I see," said Granger,
a little annoyed by Reid's tone.</p>

<p>Reid made no reply to this; and Granger continued,
"I don't pretend to account for it. You may call it hallucination,
or what you please; but I saw what I have
told you, and no amount of ridicule or argument can
convince me to the contrary."</p>

<p>"I do not dispute your word," said Reid; and then
the conversation turned upon other topics. Granger
tarried at Reid's a while longer, and then rode to
Albright, reaching his home about three hours before his
wife did.</p>

<p>The explosion at Helen's created great excitement in
the place; and, before our tenters were fairly up, the
news reached them. "Who did it?" "What was their
object?" &amp;c., &amp;c., were the questions that flew from lip
to lip.</p>

<p>"I am sure I do not know," replied the boy who
brought the news. "I was out this way after the cows;
and, seeing your tent, I thought I would come and tell
you."</p>

<p>"Was any one hurt?" asked Mrs. Granger.</p>

<!-- page 214 -->

<p>"No, ma'am: but it is the greatest wonder that there
wasn't. If Miss Harlow had been at home, she must
have been killed, sure."</p>

<p>"Wasn't she at home?" she asked, in a tone which
indicated disappointment, in spite of herself. But the
minds of the company were so occupied that no one
noticed it except the boy; and he, in speaking of it afterward,
said, "The woman acted just as if she was sorry
that Miss Harlow wasn't there."</p>

<p>"No, ma'am: she and Mister Charles were down at
Irish Pat's, looking after their sick child."</p>

<p>"Was the house very much damaged?" she asked
again.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am; at least, not very much: but it would
have burnt up, only Miss Harlow and Charles were just
coming home, and they put out the fire."</p>

<p>"Strange how things turn out!" thought she to herself;
and then aloud, "How fortunate! It would have
been a pity to have had her property destroyed. Let
her get an honest living if she can."</p>

<p>"But she would not have lost any thing," said the lad,
looking up quickly. "It was all insured; for I heard
my father say so."</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger went back into the tent; and I will
leave the reader to judge if her feelings were to be
envied.</p>

<p>Mr. Granger was not at the house when his wife
reached home. "Where is your father?" she asked of
Ward.</p>

<p>"He is out at the barn, I believe: he has just got
home."</p>

<p>"Just got home! Where has he been?" she asked,
a great fear creeping into her mind.</p>

<!-- page 215 -->

<p>"I don't know. He went away yesterday, a while
before night, and did not return till this afternoon."</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger turned, and went to her room; and the
first object that confronted her was the disguise she
had worn the night before. She stared at the bundle
a moment, as if to convince her own senses, and then
fell prostrate,&mdash;<i>really</i> fainted, for the first time in her
life.</p>

<p>When she had divested herself of her mask and outer
garments, before entering the tent, she had hidden them
in the place she had previously selected, with the intention
of getting them again the next day, and destroying
them. But, finding it difficult to get away from the rest
of the party long enough for that purpose, she had concluded
to leave them where they were. The mountain
was full of people from all parts of the country; and, if
they were found, no one would think of her putting
them there. But to find them at home, and in her own
room, was more than she was prepared for.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>THE second year of Charles Harlow's term
at school passed even more pleasantly
than the first; and, at its close, Helen
was desirous that he should enter college.
But he said, "No, mother: I do not wish
to spend years in studying dead languages, when there
is so much in the living present to occupy the mind and
heart. Let those who desire to enter the learned professions
occupy that field: I do not wish to."</p>

<p>"What would you like to be, my son?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I would like to be an architect, if you please."</p>

<p>Helen thought a while. "It is not what I would
choose for you; but you will do better in a pursuit which
you like than you can in any thing else."</p>

<p>"You give your consent, then, mother?"</p>

<!-- page 217 -->

<p>"Yes, my son: be an architect if you like."</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you, dear mother. Prof.
Wright says that one had better be a good ditcher than
a poor lawyer; and I am sure that one can attain to
eminence as an architect if he chooses." And so the
question was settled; and Charles Harlow, or, more
truly, Charles Edson Granger, went to work with a will
to perfect himself in the calling he had chosen.</p>

<p>Four years passed quickly away; and, at the age of
twenty-two, Charles E. Harlow's name was one to command
respect wherever it was known. A fine, manly
form; clear, blue eye; high, open forehead; health,
strength, intellect; an unblemished reputation, and excelling
in whatever he undertook,&mdash;what more could
any mother ask for her son?</p>

<p>There was no happier, prouder mother in Lakeside
than Helen Harlow. The words of Isaiah, "Thou
shalt forget the shame of thy youth," had been fulfilled
in her case; and she sometimes read the fifty-fourth
chapter of that prophet, feeling as though it belonged
especially to her.</p>

<p>But triumph, in this world of change, is the twin-brother
of trial. Not only the calm of national, but that
of private life, was broken by the shrill tocsin of war; and,
hearing it, the brave sprang with alacrity to arms. A
blow had been struck at Sumter, and hundreds of thousands
echoed the fierce defiance.</p>

<p>Charles Harlow obtained a captain's commission, and
enlisted a full company from the youths of Lakeside
and vicinity, without the least difficulty,&mdash;an entire company
made up of those of the ages from eighteen to
twenty-five, and not a married man amongst them.</p>

<!-- page 218 -->

<p>The ladies of the place, in the mean time, prepared a
fine flag to be presented to the company on the day of
their departure; and Helen, as mother of the captain,
was chosen to give the presentation speech. The people
had assembled to take their farewell look of brothers and
sons. Fathers, mothers, sisters, and brothers choked
back their emotions, and strove to be brave, as Helen
stepped forth, with one hand resting upon the flag, and
the other upon her breast, and, raising her eyes to
heaven, gave a short, appropriate, but unexpected invocation,
and then, with a straightforward, common-sense
speech, gave the flag into the keeping of the company.</p>

<p>When she first stepped forth, a stranger, who was
standing not far from Reid and his wife, started forward,
and, gazing intently for a few moments, said, loud enough
to be heard by those about him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am not mistaken: it's the same."</p>

<p>When the presentation was over, this stranger stepped
forth, and called the attention of the people. "Friends,"
said he, "I have a surprise in store for you,&mdash;one that
will make this day long to be remembered by the citizens
of Lakeside. I shall make no apology to the one whose
incognito I am about to reveal; for she has kept it a
secret long enough, and the place of her residence has a
right to the honor thereof. In the lady who has presented
the flag, behold 'Emendatore'!"</p>

<p>There was a short silence, till the people could fully
take in the meaning of what had been said; and then
the shout which filled the air caused Helen to retire,
covered with the sweet confusion which comes of conscious
appreciation.</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" "Who would have thought it?"

<!-- page 219 -->

"I wonder we did not think of it before: it is so like
her!" These and similar remarks flew from lip to lip
as the company separated.</p>

<p>"How did you learn that Miss Harlow was 'Emendatore'?"
asked Reid of the stranger.</p>

<p>The gentleman looked up as if he had not heard
aright; and Mr. Reid repeated his question.</p>

<p>"<i>Miss Harlow!</i> I thought she was Capt. Harlow's
mother?"</p>

<p>"So she is, sir; and has made herself respected, in
spite of her early misfortune."</p>

<p>"Ah!" was the involuntary ejaculation; and then,
as if recollecting himself, "You asked me how I learned
that she was 'Emendatore.' I saw her in Boston
something over four years since, in the office of Blank
&amp; Co.'s publishing-house; and hers is a face that, once
seen, is not easily forgotten. I could not learn who she
was, nor where she lived; but, when she arose to present
that flag, I recognized her immediately."</p>

<p>"But how did you know, sir, that we were ignorant
of the fact that she was 'Emendatore'?" continued Reid.</p>

<p>"I found a copy of her work at Mrs. Sherwood's; and
we were talking about it only last evening. I told aunt
that I had seen the writer, and when, and where; and
she said that she would give any thing to know her."</p>

<p>Here the lady in question came elbowing her way
through the crowd, with, "O James! I am so surprised!
And yet I might have known it: it is just like Helen."</p>

<p>"Mr. Reid, how do you do? My nephew, Mr. Howard,
from Boston, Mr. Reid."</p>

<p>"What would you give, aunt, to know 'Emendatore'?"
replied that gentleman, laughing heartily.</p>

<!-- page 220 -->

<p>"A prophet is not without honor"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Till you know who they are, aunt," interrupted
Mr. Howard; and, for answer, Mrs. Sherwood shook
her finger at him with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You naughty boy, to interrupt your old aunt in that
manner!"</p>

<p>They had drawn a little apart from the crowd; and,
as Reid looked up, he turned to his wife with "Did
you know that Granger was here?"</p>

<p>"No: where is he?"</p>

<p>"Coming this way: there, don't you see him?"</p>

<p>The party exchanged glances, and looked toward
Helen. The stranger noticed this, and turned to see the
new comer. It was all clear: the resemblance between
him and the young captain was sufficiently plain to
show their relationship.</p>

<p>"Why, Ed, this is a surprise!" exclaimed Reid,
grasping Granger's hand as he came up. "Mr. Howard,
Mr. Granger. By the way, surprises seem to be
the order of the day: we have just learned who the
author of 'Trial and Triumph' is."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" was Granger's only response.</p>

<p>Reid, somewhat surprised at his tone, gave him a
questioning look, and asked, "Do you know?"</p>

<p>"I have known all along," was the reply.</p>

<p>"You have!"</p>

<p>"Yes: there are passages in it that but one person
could have written." Reid made no response to this;
and Granger, with the manner of one who felt that it
was good to make an acknowledgment, continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"She has made her vow good, Reid. 'Emendatore'
stands higher than I do; and Herbert enlisted yesterday

<!-- page 221 -->

as a private, while Charles is captain of a company who
are proud of their leader."</p>

<p>"This war will try many a poor fellow's mettle,"
said Reid, wishing to change the subject.</p>

<p>"Yes; and, were it not for my children, I should be
only too glad to make my life of use to my country by
losing it on the field of battle," replied Granger.</p>

<p>"Poh, poh! you are blue, Ed. It's nonsense to talk
in that way."</p>

<p>For reply, Granger turned and walked directly to
where Charles was standing surrounded by friends, and,
extending his hand, said, "My son, will you take your
father's hand and a father's blessing?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, father," he replied, taking the proffered
hand, though his looks showed some surprise.</p>

<p>"God bless you for that, my son," continued Granger,
his emotion almost depriving him of the power of
utterance. "And now," he added, "if I never look
upon your face again, I shall at least have the comfort
of knowing that you think of me without bitterness. I
would ask your forgiveness for the great wrong I have
done you and your best of mothers; but it would look
like mockery in this your hour of triumph. Beside,
I have wronged myself more."</p>

<p>Then, turning to the company, he said, loud enough
for all to hear, "Boys, whatever else you do, heed
the advice of one who knows of its bitterness, and
never, never deceive the woman who loves and trusts
you."</p>

<p>Helen was standing at a little distance, in company
with Mr. and Mrs. Gordon and other friends. She
could not well help hearing all that was said; but the

<!-- page 222 -->

firmly-set lips and the pallor round the mouth showed
that she felt keenly, though she did not even look toward
the speaker.</p>

<p>Neither did Granger even glance toward her; but,
after his speech to the boys, he mounted his horse and
rode rapidly away.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" said Reid: "his life has been a sad
mistake."</p>

<p>"What a fool!" said Mrs. Fitzhammer to her husband.
"From my heart I pity Cousin Ella."</p>

<p>"So do I," answered Reid; for the lady had spoken
loudly, on purpose for his ears: "so do I; but not for
any thing that Granger has done."</p>

<p>He was rewarded for this speech by a "well-bred
stare," or "a <i>blank stare</i>," as he afterward said, as he
referred derisively to "Noodle's glance of annihilation."</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant was really horrified. "She couldn't see
what this world was coming to;" but, with these exceptions,
every one present sympathized with Helen,
and was proud of her success.</p>

<p>But, in the midst of life, the change called death
overtakes us, and triumph only strengthens the soul for
mightier struggles. Helen had educated her boy,
trained him both morally and intellectually to honorable
manhood; and she had maintained her own self-respect
in such a manner as to be, by her example, a
blessing to the unfortunate of her own sex: but now
that son was going from her, not to the peaceful avocations
of life, but to fields where death held high
carnival.</p>

<p>Would he return unharmed? Should she ever look

<!-- page 223 -->

upon his face again? These were the questions that
would torture her when waking, while, during the
hours of sleep, horrid visions of mangled limbs and
dying groans came to haunt her.</p>

<p>She bore it a few months, and then the little shop
was closed; while another name was added to the grand
army of nurses, who, though not half as well remunerated,
did more than doctor or priest in saving the
lives of our brave boys.</p>

<p>"I was not brave enough," she wrote to Mr. and
Mrs. Gordon, "to stay at home and bear the terrible
suspense of such weary days: I must have the excitement
which fills both hands and heart, or I should die.
God pity those who are forced to live a life of inactive
waiting! for they are the bravest of the brave, the real
sufferers, the greatest heroes of all.</p>

<p>"But I am gathering materials, Mr. Gordon, that
will help me to decide some of those questions of vital
import, of which we have several times spoken, still
deferring their discussion to some future period. And
when sweet peace broods over us again, if we are both
spared, I think that I shall be ready for the question."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVIII.</p>

<p class="small">A BROKEN SPIRIT.&mdash;DEATH.</p>

<br/>

<p class="small">"There is a repentance not to be repented of; and there is a repentance which
wounds to slay."</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p>THE noise of Mrs. Granger's fall brought
Margy, the Irish girl, to the door; but
the white face of her mistress had less
terror for her than "the horrid-looking
thing,&mdash;the Div'l's own face," upon the
bed; and, crossing herself, with a "Howly St. Patrick!"
she ran screaming out of the house.</p>

<p>Her outcries, coupled with the children's, soon
brought Mr. Granger to the scene of action.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Margy?" he asked.</p>

<p>"An' shure, yer honor, it's the Div'l's own sel' that's
in the mistress's room; and he has kilt her intirely," she
replied.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! it's only a mask. I thought she had
sense enough not to be frightened at it," said he, as
he made his way toward the room.</p>

<p>"And is it yersel' that's put the horrid thing there,
ye wicked man?" said Margy, her terror changing to
indignation.</p>

<p>He quieted the children by telling them there was
nothing to be frightened at; then entered the room

<!-- page 225 -->

where Mrs. Granger was lying, and, closing the door
behind him, turned the key in the lock.</p>

<p>"I'm not so share of it, indade," muttered the girl,
shaking her head, as he disappeared through the door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger had partially recovered; but, at the
sight of her husband, she sank away again. He looked
at her with a stern, hard expression upon his features,
quietly removed the offending bundle, together with the
mask, from sight, and then, lifting the prostrate woman,
placed her upon the bed. The movement caused her
to open her eyes; but she closed them again with a long,
shuddering sigh.</p>

<p>He left her, and, going to the kitchen, said, "Margy,
make your mistress a good cup of tea, and keep the
children from the room. She is tired out with her long
ride."</p>

<p>"Indade, an' I'd think she would be, trampin' them
hills like a hathen," responded the girl, as she turned
to do as she was bid.</p>

<p>This done, he returned to the room. Mrs. Granger
had fully recovered her consciousness, but was lying
where he had left her. She turned her eyes upon him
with a half-entreating, half-defiant look.</p>

<p>"Did you suppose, madam, that we had watched you
so long to be cheated at last?"</p>

<p>"We?" she questioned, starting up.</p>

<p>"Yes, Reid and myself."</p>

<p>She sank back upon her pillow in silence: but hers
was a brave spirit,&mdash;one worthy of a better cause; and
she would not so readily yield. "Which one was it,"
thought she, "that watched this time?" Deciding that
it was Granger, she said,&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 226 -->

<p>"It is an easy thing for you to divide the responsibility
with Reid; but you know, sir, why you were there,
and what I have borne for years; and"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ella!" He uttered this single word in tones that
made her quail; but still she would not yield.</p>

<p>"If I have been driven to desperation, could the
public know all, they would not blame me."</p>

<p>"You will have a chance to test the sympathy of the
public, madam, unless you manifest a different spirit from
this."</p>

<p>"And what do you suppose people would think of
your being there at the midnight hour?"</p>

<p>"I do not care what they would think, madam. I
followed the channel of public opinion once to my sorrow."</p>

<p>She looked up as if not quite comprehending him.</p>

<p>"That which winks at the crime of deceiving and
forsaking a young and trusting girl," he continued.</p>

<p>"Fudge! A woman who can not take care of herself
ought to sink."</p>

<p>"But you see that she has not; that she has triumphed
in spite of you and me both."</p>

<p>"A great deal you have done to prevent it!" said
she bitterly.</p>

<p>"I took the first step; and you have done the rest,
or have tried to."</p>

<p>"Why did you not marry her? I wish you had."</p>

<p>"Because of public opinion, as I have told you;
and it is the very sentiment you have just uttered,
Ella, which has made your trouble, and mine too."</p>

<p>"To what sentiment do you refer?" she asked, forgetful
of what she had just said.</p>

<!-- page 227 -->

<p>"That a woman who can not take care of herself
ought to sink."</p>

<p>"I don't see what that has had to do with it."</p>

<p>"Simply this: it is a tacit license for men to do their
utmost toward ruining woman. Acting under the sanction
of this perverted sentiment, I first won Helen,&mdash;won
her when she was a mere child as yet; and then
cast her off <i>because</i> it is considered a <i>disgrace to a man</i>
to marry one who has yielded all."</p>

<P>"But what has that to do with me?"</p>

<p>"Simply this, Ella: I married you, loving her; and,
feeling this, you have hated her intensely,&mdash;hated her
only as one woman can hate another. I had no right to
marry you, not loving you. I perjured myself at the
altar, and did you an irreparable wrong; for, had I not
done so, you might have found some one that you could
have been happy with."</p>

<p>There was something in all this so different from
what she had expected, that she did not know how to
reply. It called up the time when she had known
what it was to love,&mdash;when she was not quite the
heartless woman of the world as when pride had led
her to accept the handsome and talented Mr. Granger;
and she began to weep.</p>

<p>"Tears will do no good," said he, resuming the
sternness that he had unconsciously dropped while
dwelling upon the past. "You did not love me any
more than I did you; so we are even there. Still, you
might have found some one that you did love, had I not
tempted your love of distinction by offering myself.</p>

<p>"This thought, together with regard for my children,
will keep me silent, provided you never make another

<!-- page 228 -->

attempt of the kind; but, madam, you and I can never
live together again as husband and wife."</p>

<p>She started to her feet. "A great deal you care for
the children, to disgrace them in such a manner!" she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"There need be no disgrace, Mrs. Granger,"&mdash;how
he shrank from giving her that title!&mdash;"there need be no
disgrace. Before the public, you will still hold the position
that you have hitherto. We will have a second
bed put up in this room, and the children themselves
need not necessarily understand the real state of things.
But you madam, will understand it, will remember
that I shall suffer no word of dictation or blame, in any
manner whatever;" and, with these words, he left her to
her own thoughts.</p>

<p>As he passed from the room, he found Margy at the
door. "It seems to me," said he, "that you have been
a long time in doing what I told you."</p>

<p>"Indade, sir, an' it's all ready; but I was waitin' for
yersel' to come out: didn't think 'twas manners to go
before."</p>

<p>"Well, hurry along now, then." The fact was,
Margy had been listening; and she muttered to herself,
as she hurried away, "Guess I'd live wid a man that
wouldn't slape wid me! indade, an' indade!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger had sustained herself as well as she
could in her husband's presence; but, as soon as he was
gone, her spirits fell to the zero point. What was there
left to her now but submission to fate? and, to one of her
disposition, this was like a living death.</p>

<p>"Go away, Margy," she said, as the girl entered the
room with a cup of tea and a nice piece of toast. "I
can not eat now: I am sick."</p>

<!-- page 229 -->

<p>"Shure, and the master told me to bring it," replied
Margy in an injured tone.</p>

<p>"All right, Margy; but I can not eat any thing at
present. You can have it yourself, if you like."</p>

<p>"Quare doings here, indade, an' indade! master
scarin' mistress with them outlandish fixins, and scoldin'
her till death mostly, an' then orderin' good things for
her that she can't tech, poor thing! I'm thinkin' that
Margy M'Pherson had better be gettin' out'n this. I'll
ask the praste about it, ennyhow." So saying, the girl
sat down with a hearty relish to her toast and tea.</p>

<p>From this time forth, Mrs. Granger was a changed
woman. She seldom went into company; and, when she
did, the life and vivacity of other days was gone; and
at home there was the listlessness of defeat in every
movement. People wondered for a while, and made various
surmises as to the cause; but, finding no solution
to their queries, they were soon forgotten in some new
excitement.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant and Mrs. Fitzhammer were still her
friends; but they tried in vain to penetrate the secret of
her condition. The doctors said "that she was going into
a decline," because they did not know what else to say;
and, finally, it became the settled conviction of the people,
that Mrs. Granger would never be any better. As
her ill health dated from that trip on the mountain, it
was sagely concluded that she had overdone and
caught cold at that time.</p>

<p>"Overdone;" and so she had, but in a way they little
dreamed of. At times the old spirit would flash up; and
then the struggle within would give her a wildness of
manner that caused people to hint at "mental aberration."

<!-- page 230 -->

"It was not an unusual thing," the old ladies
said, "for one in her state of health to be deranged at
times. And, besides, it ran in the family: her great
grandfather's brother, Major Ward, had died insane."</p>

<p>Thus people accounted for things in their own way,
and were left to their own conclusions.</p>

<p>She had continued to sink from year to year; and,
when the war broke out, her condition was such that
she seldom left her room.</p>

<p>Herbert's course at school had not been the most
creditable one; and, when his mother was told that he
had enlisted as a private, she only said, "Just like his
father; not a particle of pride about him: a Ward
would have gone as an officer, or not at all."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzhammer and Mrs. Grant, shocked as they
had been at the course taken by Granger on the day of
the flag presentation, could not rest till they had laid
the whole matter before his wife. They forgot the condition
of the sick woman, in their desire to create a sensation;
so, on the next day, they made their way to
Albright.</p>

<p>"How do you do, my dear cousin?" said Mrs. Fitzhammer,
in that peculiarly pitying tone which is so
offensive to a proud spirit.</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger's eyes flashed, but the emotion went no
further. "About as usual, I believe," she replied, in
even apathetic tones.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;what do you think?" continued this female
tormentor. "Oh! I shall never take any interest in a
story after this."</p>

<p>"I should laugh to see you lose your interest in fiction,"
said Mrs. Granger, with something of her old
manner.</p>

<!-- page 231 -->

<p>"Oh! but you won't, Cousin Ella, when I have told
you all; for I shall always be thinking what kind of
characters it is that write them. Only think of the hypocrite
keeping it to herself so long!"</p>

<p>"I always told you so," said Mrs. Grant. "She can
hide any thing if she undertakes to; but she can't make
a fool of me."</p>

<p>"No; for the Lord has got the start of her," said
Granger in an under-tone, hearing the remark as he
passed the window.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Mrs. Granger, looking
from one to the other.</p>

<p>"Don't let the news shock you too much, my dear
friend," said Mrs. Grant; "but we have learned positively
that that creature, Helen Harlow, is 'Emendatore.' "</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger sank back upon her pillow without a
word; but the new Irish girl, who came into the room
at that moment, opened her eyes very wide; and, as she
went out again, she was heard to say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mend-a-tore; an' shure, it's a quare name for a
Christian woman!"</p>

<p>All three heard it; and Mrs. Granger smiled in spite
of the sadness which oppressed her, while Mrs. Grant
and Mrs. Fitzhammer laughed till they could scarcely
breathe. "Not so bad, after all," said Mrs. Grant, as
soon as she could speak. "She tore her reputation
years ago, and has been trying to mend it ever since."</p>

<p>At this, "Noodle," as Granger called her, went off
again in another perfect paroxysm of laughter.</p>

<p>"Come, Add, don't kill yourself," said Mrs. Granger
at length.</p>

<!-- page 232 -->

<p>This brought the lady back to a condition of sobriety.
For a few minutes there was silence; and then Mrs.
Grant, with a long drawn-sigh, resumed the conversation.</p>

<p>"But I have not told you all the news, my dear
friend; neither would I, but I think you ought to know.
Oh, dear! this is a wicked world!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Granger opened her eyes with a show of interest,
and Mrs. Grant continued. "Your husband, my
dear friend, was at Lakeside yesterday; and what do you
think he did? I should die, I know I should, if it was
my husband. He actually called Charles Harlow his
son before all the people."</p>

<p>"He did!" shrieked Mrs. Granger, starting to her
feet.</p>

<p>"Don't, don't, Ella! don't take it so hard: you will
make yourself sick," said Mrs. Fitzhammer.</p>

<p>"It's enough to make anybody feel," said Mrs.
Grant. "And their gathering around that fellow, and
calling him 'Captain' all so grand!"</p>

<p>"Calling who 'Captain'?" asked Mrs. Granger.</p>

<p>"Why, Charles Harlow. He has raised a company,
got a captain's commission, and is off to the war. But
the Lakeside folks,&mdash;fools I had liked to have called
them, only it would not be right, you know,&mdash;well, the
ladies of Lakeside, they gave the company a splendid
flag, and chose Helen, as the captain's mother, to present
it."</p>

<p>The thought of her own son enlisting as a private
came up in contrast with what she had just heard; and
the tortured woman sank back with a groan.</p>

<p>"Don't, now," said Mrs. Grant: "don't fret. You

<!-- page 233 -->

will kill yourself, poor dear, and then what will become
of your children?"</p>

<p>"No, I will not die: I will throw off this incubus
that has held me so long, and live to torment him. He
would be only too glad to bury me, that he might marry
that creature; but he never shall!" And Mrs. Granger
arose from her bed, and, dressing herself with care, went
to the table that evening, the first time for months.</p>

<p>Mr. Granger looked at her inquiringly as she came
in, bowed to the ladies, and ate his meal in silence;
but Bridget stared as though she had seen a ghost.</p>

<p>"That is right. Cousin Ella," said Mrs. Fitzhammer,
as they returned to the sitting-room: "there is the true
Ward grit in you yet. But you must not tire yourself
too much, or you will not hold out. Here, lie down on
this sofa."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to lie down, neither do I wish to be
insulted further with your sympathy, Addie Fitzhammer,"
was the curt reply. That personage was silent;
and Mrs. Grant looked toward her and smiled, as if to
say, "She will do well enough so long as she keeps her
spunk up."</p>

<p>This condition of things continued for several days:
but the strain was too great; and, when the re-action
came, she sank lower than ever, took to her bed, and
never left it but for the grave. True, she lingered for a
few months; for she was constitutionally what is called
tenacious of life. Her frame did not readily yield to
disease: but she was too broken in spirit to sustain herself
as she could otherwise have done; and the very day
on which Helen left Lakeside, the unhappy woman
breathed her last.</p>

<!-- page 234 -->

<p>Let us not condemn her too severely; for she was
sinned against, as well as sinning: but let us rather
turn our attention to the causes which produce results
so much to be deplored. We may say that we can not
reach to remove them. But are we certain of this?
Humanity has not yet learned the half of its powers;
and "<i>can not</i>" ought not to belong to the vocabulary of
a progressive people.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>

<p class="small">IN THE HOSPITAL.&mdash;WOMAN'S PROTECTORS.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p class="small">"Our strong protectors they, if we from them will but protect ourselves:
if not, then we may sink, thrust by <i>protecting</i> hands beyond the pale of hope."</p>

<br/>

<p>HELEN was in her fortieth year: still, the
most of people would not have called her
thirty-five; and some insisted that
she could not be more than thirty. But
who lay upon those cots of suffering
cared not whether she was thirty or fifty. If they
could but feel her soft hand upon their aching brows, or
listen to her musical tones as she read to them from
time to time, to while the tedious hours away, they were
satisfied.</p>

<p>For three months she had been the nurse and valued
assistant at Hospital B., in the vicinity of Washington;
and, in that time, many a poor soldier had been made
more comfortable through her care, and not a few owed
their lives to her patient skill. The common soldier or
the wounded officer blessed her very shadow as it
passed; but, whilst those in charge could hardly afford
to dispense with her services, they did not like her.</p>

<p>The fact was, she was not humble, not deferential
enough. She met them too much like an equal; and
was, at the same time, so faithful in her duties, that they

<!-- page 236 -->

could find no cause of complaint. The physician in
Helen's department was a gentleman of fine personal
appearance, who seemed to think himself quite irresistible;
and, fixing his eye upon her when she first came,
seemed determined to make her the object of his especial
regards.</p>

<p>But her ideas of the duties of a nurse and his seemed
to differ somewhat; and she ignored him so thoroughly
at this point of difference, that he could not even prefer
his claims.</p>

<p>This, of course, annoyed him exceedingly. Herbert
Granger was among the wounded; and Helen paid particular
attention to his wants, devoting her spare moments
to him, as far as possible. He had no idea that she
was Charles Harlow's mother, and once expressed his
wonder that she should be so kind,&mdash;should take such
an interest in a "scapegrace" like him.</p>

<p>She smiled in reply, and said, "I knew your parents
once, and wish to do all I can for their boy."</p>

<p>"When, where, Miss Harlow?" he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"Not since you can recollect; at least, I have known
but little of them since: so don't bother your head about
it, but lie still and get well."</p>

<p>"Miss Harlow, I wish you would tell me all you
know; for I am so hungry for home."</p>

<p>"Well, here is a letter: read that, while I go and
make some gruel for that poor fellow in the next ward;"
and, handing him a letter that had come that morning,
she left him to its perusal.</p>

<p>When she returned, about an hour afterward, she
found him weeping bitterly. She did not speak, but
went and placed her hand upon his head, soothing him

<!-- page 237 -->

as she would a weary child; knowing, that, if it was any
thing that he wished her to know, he would tell her of
his own accord.</p>

<p>With a child's abandon of grief, he caught her hand
to his lips, and kissed it, sobbing, "O Miss Harlow! I
have no mother now."</p>

<p>"Your mother dead!" exclaimed Helen, manifesting
more feeling than she was aware.</p>

<p>But Herbert was too much absorbed in his own grief
to notice this. "Yes, Miss Harlow: she has gone. Oh!
what a wretch I was to enlist and leave her, when her
health was so poor!"</p>

<p>Helen was so shocked, that she did not speak again for
some minutes; and, when she did, it was to inquire about
the particulars.</p>

<p>"Here is the letter," said he: "read it for yourself.
I can not tell you about it."</p>

<p>Herbert was occupying a single room, parted off from
the others; but the curtain that served as a door was
put back, leaving the entire room open to the passer-by.
The doctor had started on his rounds, and, stopping just
out of range from those within, had seen and heard all.</p>

<p>As Helen came out of the door, he confronted her
with "Miss Harlow, if you manifest your preference so
openly, I fear that the rest of the boys will be jealous;"
accompanying the words with a look which showed that
he would like to become her <i>protector</i>.</p>

<p>She looked up to see what he wished, as he commenced
speaking; but, gathering the import of his
words, passed on without further notice of his insult.
That afternoon, as she was passing by where some fresh
arrivals were lying, the word "Mother!" arrested her

<!-- page 238 -->

steps; and the next moment she was locked in the arms
of her son.</p>

<p>After the first greetings were over, Helen drew back,
and looked questioningly upon his pale face.</p>

<P>"Only a scratch, mother, and I shall soon be up
again; but, if those rascally surgeons had had their way,
I should have been a cripple for life."</p>

<p>Just here, orders came to remove "private" Granger
to another part of the building, and to put Major Harlow
in his place. Helen turned quickly: she thought, at
first, that she would oppose the arrangement; but, remembering
the doctor's look and tone, she simply said,
"Please don't let Mr. Granger know who is to occupy
his place."</p>

<p>Charles looked up. "It is Herbert," she replied; and
there was no further remark.</p>

<p>"Do I hear aright. <i>Miss</i> Harlow?" asked the doctor,
the next time he met her.</p>

<p>"What have you heard?" she asked.</p>

<p>"That you are Major Harlow's mother."</p>

<p>"I am, sir."</p>

<p>"As young looking and as handsome as you are!
And here you have been making us believe that you
were a young lady, all this time," said he, with the most
winning smile at his command.</p>

<p>"I told you my name was Helen Harlow, sir: the
prefix has been of your own choosing," she replied; and
then, seeing the address of a letter lying on a table before
him, she added, "I should like to have a talk with
you, doctor, when I am a little more at leisure."</p>

<p>"With pleasure, madam; with the utmost pleasure.
Come here at any time after three o'clock,"</p>

<!-- page 239 -->

<p>"Coming around at last," he soliloquized; while
Helen to herself, "He little thinks what I have to say to
him!"</p>

<p>It was about four in the afternoon before Helen
knocked at the doctor's door. She came for directions
and medicines, but took the time to ask the questions
she wished.</p>

<p>The gentleman hastened to offer her a seat; but she
negatived the movement with her hand, and said, "I
saw a letter upon your table, this morning, addressed to
the Hon. Charles Edson, Ross Cove, Me. Are you a
relative of his, sir?"</p>

<p>"I have the honor to be his son," was the somewhat
pompous answer.</p>

<p>"Are you a son of his last marriage?" she continued.</p>

<p>"I am the oldest son of that marriage, madam. Are
you acquainted with my father?" he asked, manifesting
some surprise.</p>

<p>"Your mother and mine were sisters."</p>

<p>"It is not possible!" he exclaimed, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"I have suspected it," she replied. "It is not only
possible, but true, Dr. Edson."</p>

<p>"And you have known this all along? Why, my
fair cousin, I never dreamed of such a thing. But
why have I been kept in ignorance of this? I did not
know that my mother ever had a sister who married a
Harlow."</p>

<p>Without noticing his last question, Helen continued,
"You accused me, this morning, of partiality for Mr.
Granger: know, then, that that young man stands in the
same relation to me as you would to my mother if she
were living,&mdash;the son of the man who betrayed me, and
my son's half-brother."</p>

<!-- page 240 -->

<p>The doctor staggered as though under a heavy blow.
"You do not mean&mdash;you are not my sister!"</p>

<p>"Your cousin and your half-sister, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, I do recollect now, that my father once, in a
fit of repentance, just after my mother's death, told me
something of this; but he did not inform me that the
girl he talked so pathetically of betraying was my
mother's sister."</p>

<p>Helen noticed his tone, and added, "And you promised
him, that, if he would bring me home, you would
receive me as a sister."</p>

"Well, yes,&mdash;I believe there was something of the
sort said," he answered; "for, having no sister, the
idea rather pleased us."</p>

<p>"Well, Dr. Edson, you need have no fears of my
claiming relationship: that is not my purpose at all. I
thought, however, that I would <i>protect myself</i> from
your impertinence by informing you of the fact; for I
hardly believe you bad enough to persecute a sister,
knowing her to be such."</p>

<p>The manner in which Helen said this irritated the doctor
so much that he retorted, "Had you always been as
careful to protect yourself, <i>Miss</i> Harlow, it would have
been well; but 'Like mother, like daughter' seems to
have been true in this case."</p>

<p>Helen was about leaving the room; but at this she
turned and gave the gentleman a look that he was not
to forget soon.</p>

<p>"What about 'Like father, like son,' Dr. Edson?
My mother never pressed the lips of any man but your
father: did he live as purely? I have lived as my
mother did, true to the last: are you as much like your
father?"</p>

<!-- page 241 -->

<p>There was a withering scorn in her tones, which made
the bold man quail, in spite of his efforts to maintain his
dignity. "My father is a man who is respected wherever
he is known," he said.</p>

<p>"And so is <i>my father</i>, sir; but that does not prove
that he always behaved in a respectable manner, or
that his son has improved upon his example," she replied.
"And now, sir, I forbid you, from this time
forth, to speak to me, or to recognize me in any manner
whatever, further than your profession demands;" and,
before he could reply, she was gone.</p>

<p>"My God!" he muttered, as he gazed after her retreating
form: "a woman like that is worth possessing;
and the man who cast her off is a fool."</p>

<p>Helen went directly from the doctor's office to Charles.</p>

<p>"Mother," said he, "what is it that annoys you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing very much, my son: why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Because I wish to know, of course."</p>

<p>"Nothing; only that Dr. Edson is from Ross Cove,
Maine, and my half-brother."</p>

<p>"Mother!" and Charles Harlow raised himself up
on his elbow.</p>

<p>"There, lie down now, and behave yourself, you
naughty boy," said she, as she playfully boxed his ears.</p>

<p>"But how did you learn it? You did not claim him
as a relative, mother?"</p>

<p>"Does not my boy know me better than that? I asserted
the fact, but repudiated the relation."</p>

<p>"Repudiated it?"</p>

<p>"Yes: I forbade him to recognize me in any manner
whatever, other than our relative positions here professionally
render necessary."</p>

<!-- page 242 -->

<p>"Why did you do that, mother?"</p>

<p>"Because the man would think that he was stooping,
was conferring an <i>honor</i>, by acknowledging me as his
sister: and you know, my son, that your mother never
accepts such recognition from any one, man or woman;
never has, and never will."</p>

<p>"I should like to meet the man, or woman either,
who could confer a greater honor than they received by
recognizing my mother," said Charles proudly.</p>

<p>"Dis way, massa, dis way," said the obsequious darkey,
as he conducted a gentleman toward the door of
the room occupied by Helen and Charles; "right in
dar; and the lady is wid him:" and they turned to meet
Mr. Gordon.</p>

<p>"Helen, you here! God bless you! Major Harlow,
allow me to congratulate you; not on your wound, but
your promotion," said he, extending a hand to both.</p>

<p>"Promotion over the grave of a worthier man,"
replied Charles, with tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Helen.</p>

<p>"Major Wright, a brother of Prof. Wright of Springville;
and a nobler fellow never lived."</p>

<p>"Have you seen Herbert Granger, Mr. Gordon?"
said Helen.</p>

<p>"No: I have just arrived. Who is he? a son of Mr.
Granger's of Albright?"</p>

<p>"He is. Please don't let him know who Charles is, as
it might fret him in his present state. The poor fellow
is mourning over the death of his mother; and that is
as much as he ought to bear at once."</p>

<p>"Have you seen him, Helen?" asked Mr. Gordon.</p>

<p>"Yes: but he does not know who I am; and I don't
want him to learn, so long as I can prevent it."</p>

<!-- page 243 -->

<p>Just here Dr. Edson came in, ostensibly to see how
"Major Harlow" was getting along; but really to test
Helen's temper a little further. In a moment, Helen
was simply the nurse.</p>

<p>"Dr. Edson, Mr. Gordon," said Charles with cool
politeness. The doctor made a slight examination of
Charles's wound, looked at his tongue, felt his pulse, and
then gave Helen some simple directions, taking particular
pains to call her "<i>Miss</i> Harlow." Charles noticed
this, and so did Mr. Gordon; and were aware, from the
doctor's manner, that it was done on purpose.</p>

<p>Charles's eye flashed; but, restraining himself, he
ignored the intended insult by saying, "Mother, dear,
I am thirsty: will you hand me some water?"</p>

<p>But Mr. Gordon followed him from the room; and, as
soon as they were beyond the hearing of the others,
said, "Doctor, I have been acquainted with that lady,
Major Harlow's mother, for years; and any rudeness to
her will be looked upon as done to myself."</p>

<p>The doctor stared. "I was not aware that it was
rude to call a woman by her right name," he said.</p>

<p>"It was not the matter, sir, but the manner of your
address that was offensive," replied Mr. Gordon.</p>

<p>"And pray, sir, who are you, that you defend the
lady so valiantly?" asked the doctor coolly.</p>

<p>"One who knows her father, and yours too, young
man."</p>

<p>"And her son's father also, I presume," said Edson,
white with rage; for to be told that Helen was his sister
twice in one day, and that after his course toward her,
was more than he knew how to bear.</p>

<p>"I do, sir; and, if he was here, he would knock you
down for your impudence," replied Mr. Gordon.</p>

<!-- page 244 -->

<p>"Perhaps you had better do it yourself, sir."</p>

<p>"No, Dr. Edson; my profession as a minister does
not permit of such an act: but I will confess that the
old Adam is so strong within me, at times, that I can
hardly restrain myself;" and, turning abruptly away, he
went back to the room occupied by Charles and his
mother.</p>

<p>"Do you know who that man is, Helen?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I do, Mr. Gordon; but have refused to recognize
him, or to be recognized by him."</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon looked at her keenly. "As strong to
assert yourself as ever, I see," he said at length. "I
felt like knocking the fellow down, and would have done
so but for the name of it; but I guess you will take care
of him without my help."</p>

<p>Charles laughed aloud. "A pretty confession that,
for a minister, Mr. Gordon!"</p>

<p>"I know it, major; but, since this war commenced,
I sometimes feel as if I was losing my identity,&mdash;as if
I was not half as much a minister as before."</p>

<p>"I think we are all learning lessons," remarked
Helen.</p>

<p>"I wish, Mr. Gordon," said Charles presently,
"that you would go and see Herbert Granger."</p>

<p>"I will: where is he?" Helen led the way.</p>

<p>"Mr. Granger, here is a gentleman who knows your
family,&mdash;the Rev. Mr. Gordon, from Glencove, New
Hampshire;" and, saying this, she left them together.</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon grasped the young man's hand.
"Happy to meet you, Mr. Granger: have never had
the pleasure of your acquaintance, but knew your parents
well."</p>

<!-- page 245 -->

<p>Herbert barely responded, and, looking after Helen,
asked, "Do you know, Mr. Gordon, if Major Harlow
is the Charles Harlow from Lakeside who attended
school at Springville some years since?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon was taken by surprise, and could not
well avoid answering in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"And the lady who has just left us is his mother?"
continued Granger.</p>

<p>"She is," was the reply.</p>

<p>Granger turned away with a groan. Presently he
looked up. "You may think I am wicked, Mr. Gordon.
I suppose I am; but my mother is dead, and I wish that
I was too."</p>

<p>"Fie, fie, young man! You are sick now, and depressed.
You will soon get over this, and enjoy life
yet."</p>

<p>"My mother sick and dying," he continued, without
noticing Mr. Gordon's remarks, "and I to be receiving
the attention of her enemy,&mdash;the woman who made her
life bitter!"</p>

<p>"If you think that Miss Harlow ever did any thing
to make your mother unhappy, you are mistaken,"
said the minister in his kindest tones; for he really pitied
the young man.</p>

<p>Herbert was silent, and Mr. Gordon continued: "Your
father forsook Hiss Harlow, and married your mother,&mdash;a
very great wrong, but one that his children are not to
blame for. After his marriage, your father never saw
Miss Harlow till her son was sixteen years of age,&mdash;the
time when she was taking him to Springville to school."</p>

<p>"Do you know this to be true?" asked Herbert at
length.</p>

<!-- page 246 -->

<p>"If I did not, I would not say so, Mr. Granger."</p>

<p>"It may be true, but my mother did not think so,
sir; and then to have <i>her son</i> coming here and taking
my room as Major Harlow, while my mother's son
must give place because he is only a poor private!
But what am I saying, sir? I have not my mother's
pride, or I should not be telling this to you;" and, turning
abruptly away, he could not be induced to say any
thing further.</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon was grieved, and so was Helen: but it
was the Ward pride, the Ward hatred, that had been
aroused; and all efforts at a friendly feeling on the
part of either Helen or Charles were rejected with
scorn.</p>

<p>He did, it is true, accept Helen's attentions till he was
able to wait upon himself; but he accepted them as
from a servant, never once acknowledging his obligation
by either word or look.</p>

<p>He did not seem to care whether he lived or died;
but, when he found that he was really recovering, he
was only anxious to get away from the place.</p>

<p>"Let him go," said Charles: "it is his nature, and
he must act it out." But Helen sighed, and wished that
it were otherwise.</p>

<p>Dr. Edson, finding that Helen would not be friendly
with him, continued his petty annoyances; till, one
day, he found himself quietly removed, and another
taking his place.</p>

<p>He never knew exactly how this came about; but
his curses, if not loud, were deep. But Dr. Edson was
not an exception: those who were like him were found
in every department of army-life; and those women

<!-- page 247 -->

who went to care for the suffering soldier found but too
often, if they would not accept the kind of <i>protection</i>
that those in power desired to bestow, that their places
would be given to those who would.</p>

<p>Helen's experience with the doctor was but one of
the many lessons that she learned of human nature and
its workings, during the time that she acted as nurse;
and, when she returned home, she was often heard to
say, "Give woman the power to protect herself, and
teach her that she must do it: but mock her no longer
with the idea that she has a protector in man; at least,
not while she is thought to be his legitimate prey, if he
is strong enough, psychologically, to overcome her
reason or control her judgment."</p>

<p>There is one more incident that I will relate before I
leave this part of my story. There was a Capt. Gilbert
in the hospital for a while, who, not being sufficiently
recovered from an ugly wound in the left shoulder for
active service, was still able to be about. He was a
middle-aged man of active temperament, and, wearied
of idleness, would often aid Helen in her duties. One
day, Helen heard Sam the darkey saying to this
captain,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mity fine woman, dat, mas'r cap'n, if she do hab a
boy an' no man."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Sam?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"I means, mas'r cap'n, dat Mas'r Harlow, who went
away just afore you cum, he her boy."</p>

<p>"What, Miss Harlow?"</p>

<p>"He call her mudder, ennyhow."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sam: here's some money for you."</p>

<p>"Gosh!" said Sam, as he caught the shining coin:
"you's good, mas'r, ennyhow."</p>

<!-- page 248 -->

<p>After this, Capt. Gilbert was particularly attentive;
not rude, but continually manifesting that kind of interest
which is so annoying to a sensitive woman.
Helen bore it a while without seeming to notice it;
But one day, when he had been more persistent than
usual, she said to him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Captain, when you were a boy, did you ever go a-skating?"</p>

<p>He seemed somewhat surprised at the address of such
a question in midsummer, but replied, "Often, often,
my dear Miss Harlow: it was a favorite sport of mine."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see a great rude boy purposely trip up
a little girl because she was not used to the ice, and he
could do so just as well as not?"</p>

<p>"I do not recollect now that I ever did: but I am
certain, if I had witnessed such a thing, that I should
have thrashed the villain within an inch of his life; or,
if not, it would have been because I wasn't able."</p>

<p>Helen smiled. "But suppose, Mr. Gilbert, that all the
other boys upon the ice had taken it into their heads that
they had a perfect right to do the same thing, because
the first one had."</p>

<p>The captain hesitated. "I do not see the purport of
your questions, Miss Harlow; but I do not think that
such a company of boys could be found," he said at
length.</p>

<p>"Still, if the girl chances to be seventeen instead of
seven, and the big boy twenty-three or four, and he
succeeds in tripping her on the slippery steeps of youthful
passion, the others will not even permit her to rise
if they can prevent it, but look upon her from henceforth
as their lawful prey."</p>

<!-- page 249 -->

<p>Helen looked the gallant captain full in the eye as
she said this: and he evidently understood her meaning,
for he colored to the roots of his hair; and from
that time forth he never said, "<i>My dear Miss
Harlow</i>."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XX.</p>

<p class="small">SCOUTING AND ITS RESULTS.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p class="small">"Sound the loud bugle; the war-dogs, still howling,<br/>

Are eagerly snuffing their prey:<br/>

The red cloud of war is o'er us still gleaming.<br/>

While peace stands afar, all weary with waiting<br/>

The hour that shall give us again to her sway."</p>

<br/>

<p>"MAJOR HARLOW." Charles bowed,
touched his cap, and waited the pleasure
of his superior officer.</p>

<p>"I have sent for you to consult with
you in reference to a difficult, I may say
dangerous, undertaking."</p>

<p>"I shall be happy, colonel, to serve you by any or
every means in my power."</p>

<p>"You have heard of Wilson's gang, major."</p>

<p>"Do you mean the rebel scout, Col. Hazen?"</p>

<p>"Rebel devil, I should call him," said the colonel
excitedly: "for, if ever the prince of darkness was incarnate,
I believe he is in Sam Wilson."</p>

<p>"I have heard of his exploits, and I think I saw him
once," replied Harlow.</p>

<p>"Ah, you have!" exclaimed Hazen, his small black
eyes brightening till they shone like two coals: "well,
you are just the man I want, then. I want Sam Wilson

<!-- page 251 -->

brought to me a prisoner; and the man who does
this shall be well rewarded."</p>

<p>"I am at your service, colonel, but want no reward
further than the consciousness of having done my
duty," replied Charles.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, man; none of your transcendental ideas
in practical matters. The consciousness of having done
one's duty is well enough; but we all like the substantial
reward, no matter what we may say."</p>

<p>Charles knew his colonel too well to argue the point
with him; so he simply asked, "What do you propose,
colonel?"</p>

<p>"Dem me, didn't I tell you that I wanted Sam Wilson?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but what course do you propose, to accomplish
that?"</p>

<p>"I propose nothing. Major Harlow: dem me if I am
fool enough to set a man to work who doesn't know
enough to do his own planning."</p>

<p>"Allow me to make a proposition, then, colonel."</p>

<p>"Just what I want, sir. It takes you a dem'd long
while to see the point, though. But I'm waiting: speak
on."</p>

<p>"The old saying is, that it takes a rogue to catch a
rogue; and I propose, Col. Hazen, that a scout shall
catch a scout."</p>

<p>The colonel settled back in his chair, and laughed
heartily. "Go on," said he: "you are all right."</p>

<p>"I propose, then, with your permission, to take a
picked company of men, and go on a scouting tour;
simply this, and nothing more, the ostensible purpose"&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 252 -->

<p>"And the real one Sam Wilson."</p>

<p>"Yes, colonel; and not even the men themselves to
know this, only as I choose to inform such as I think it
best to."</p>

<p>"You are all right, major: dem me, I knew you
would be. Go and pick your men, and don't let the
grass grow under your feet, young man."</p>

<p>Charles smiled. He knew that a kind heart beat
under the rough exterior which Col. Hazen so delighted
to present; and, turning away, he was about to proceed
on his mission, when he was called back with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't be in a hurry, major: stop and take a glass
of wine with an old chap like myself."</p>

<p>"Thank you, colonel, for the honor intended; but I
fear that it would not make my head any the clearer
for my intended enterprise."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to tell me, Major Harlow, that
you refuse to drink with me?" thundered the colonel.</p>

<p>"Sorry to offend you, sir; but I would refuse to
drink with the president, should he ask me to do such a
thing."</p>

<p>"The president is no better than I am, young man."</p>

<p>"Of course, not; nor any better than I am, Col.
Hazen."</p>

<p>"Go along with you, before my sword resents your
impudence," was the response; ending in "Ha, ha!
good spunk; dem me, if he hasn't."</p>

<p>Major Harlow lost no time in selecting his men for
the projected enterprise,&mdash;ten active fellows, fleet of
foot and strong of limb. These were all he asked; for
he depended more upon strategy than numbers for the
accomplishment of his object. This done, the next step

<!-- page 253 -->

was to fix upon a place of rendezvous, and arrange a
general plan of action: for particular movements, each
was to depend upon the exigencies of the moment.</p>

<p>For their headquarters they selected a farmhouse
some ten miles from Vicksburg,&mdash;the residence of Judge
Benifield. The judge was at heart a Union man, but
was so situated that he dare not make his real sentiments
known. Like many others in the same situation,
his house became, in turn, the resort of those belonging
to both armies,&mdash;he always taking the attitude of submission
when our soldiers visited him; but many a
Union soldier owed his life to the judge or his pretty
daughter, and many a Union officer demanded at the
point of the sword that which was gladly given under
cover of this seeming compulsion. In fact, he always
assumed friendship to the rebels, and hatred to the
"cursed Yankees."</p>

<p>Sybil Benifield was seventeen years old; of medium
height, and not handsome, but what is called interesting.
There was something about her which charmed
those who made her acquaintance; though, if they had
tried, they could not have told wherein the charm lay.</p>

<p>Major Harlow had met Miss Benifield once; but we
will not say that this had any thing to do with his choice
of headquarters: of course, it had not.</p>

<p>But, one pleasant day in June, he came to the door
with his ten picked men; and, summoning the judge, he
said, "Mr. Benifield, I wish to make your house a center
for myself and men for a while. We may be here
all at a time, or separately; but, if you play them false
in any manner, you will answer to Gen. Grant for the
offense."</p>

<!-- page 254 -->

<p>"You know my sentiments, sir," replied the judge;
"but this is no longer a free country, and one must
submit when he can't help himself." He was particularly
bitter in his manner of saying this; but there
was a look in his eye which showed that it was intended
for other ears.</p>

<p>"I don't care a pin for your sentiments, but shall
watch your acts," replied Charles, in the same arbitrary
tone that he had used at first.</p>

<p>"Well, major."</p>

<p>"Harlow is my name, sir."</p>

<p>"My house is at your service, and my family at your
mercy, Major Harlow; and I hope you will be gentleman
enough to respect the common rights of humanity."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, you old rebel! do you measure us by yourselves?
But my men here would like some dinner; and
then we will be off for to-day."</p>

<p>"That you shall have, major; and, if you make no
heavier demands upon us, I shall be glad." Just here,
Charles saw the figure of a man stealing quietly out of
the back door. He paid no attention to this for he
knew that the judge was so situated, that it would not
be safe for him to have one of the rebels taken at his
house, and determined, therefore, to avoid it if possible.
The judge had seen the movement also, and showed
his relief at the absence of said individual by a change
of countenance and manner which gave a truer index
to his real feelings.</p>

<p>"Walk into the parlor, major," said he with a smile
of relief. "You will find my wife and daughter there;
and I will go and give orders for the comfort of your

<!-- page 255 -->

men;" and, throwing open the door, he announced,
"Major Harlow, ladies."</p>

<p>Mrs. Benifield arose with quiet dignity, and gave
him her hand in welcome; while Miss Benifield only
bowed. In a few moments, however, they were all
three pleasantly engaged in conversation; and the time
passed so rapidly, that Charles was quite surprised when
dinner was announced.</p>

<p>"You have excellent servants, Mrs. Benifield," said
he, "or you have the faculty of making time seem
very short. It seems hardly ten minutes since the
orders for dinner were given." The lady smiled, but
her daughter pointed to a letter lying behind an ottoman.</p>

<p>Charles turned and picked it up, and was about to
give it into her hands, when she said, "It is not mine:
some one has dropped it there." The tone in which
this was said was so significant, that he transferred it
to his own pocket. As soon as he could find an opportunity,
he examined the missive, and found that it was
a line from Wilson to one of his men, and contained
information of importance. Charles had been so careful
in opening it, that he had but little difficulty in
closing it up again in such a manner that no one would
think that it had been disturbed.</p>

<p>"This will be missed and looked for," thought he;
and, going back to the parlor, he waited till he caught
Sybil's eye, and then dropped it in the same place that
he had taken it from. She smiled, and, presently after,
made an excuse to go to that part of the room; and, in
doing so, transferred the note to her pocket. "You
had not been gone an hour, major," she said to him
afterward, "when that letter was inquired for."</p>

<!-- page 256 -->

<p>"Indeed: and what did you tell the gentleman?"</p>

<p>"What could I tell him, but that I had picked it up
after he went out, and kept it for him?" she responded
with a merry laugh.</p>

<p>"Which was true. Miss Benifield."</p>

<p>"Of course it was, major; I did not pick it up
before he went out, and I did not give it to any one
else."</p>

<p>"But you have not told me who the gentleman
was."</p>

<p>"Certainly not. I am a rebel, you know: but I
have just dropped a photograph; and if you pick it
up, and refuse to give it to me, I can't help it." She
here made a point to get the little card which had
fallen to the floor; but he was too quick for her.</p>

<p>"Give it to me, sir." She uttered this in a quick,
distressed tone, which the twinkle in her black eye
contradicted.</p>

<p>"Couldn't do it, miss," he responded, placing it in
his breast-pocket.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence; and then she said,
"Major Harlow, this life of double dealing is so distasteful
to me, that, at times, I almost hate myself; but
what can I do? It is the only way in which I can help
the cause I love."</p>

<p>"Do as your conscience dictates. Miss Benifield,
and don't be troubled about results. If deceit is not
an element of one's nature, it will be practiced no
longer than safety demands. We never voluntarily
remain in a condition that is hateful to us."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you say so, major; for I have
feared that you would come to believe that I was a
natural hypocrite," she replied.</p>

<!-- page 257 -->

<p>"Really, Miss Benifield, you make me very happy:
I had not dared to hope that you cared for my opinion."
She blushed; and, thus encouraged, he took her hand
in his. "Sybil,&mdash;may I call you so?&mdash;will you be my
wife?"</p>

<p>"When victory perches beside the eagle," said she,
lifting her eye proudly to his.</p>

<p>But we have got a little ahead of our story; though,
when one recollects how witching a thing love is, I do
not know as it is to be wondered at. So we shall not
ask the reader's pardon, but simply go back and take
up the thread we have dropped.</p>

<p>The man who had left the judge's house so quietly,
as Harlow and his men came upon the scene of action,
was one of Wilson's men. He started for Wilson's
camp, or, rather, cave,&mdash;for it was nothing less. He
started for this as soon as he was out of sight of the
house: but he had not gone far, before he missed the
letter he had dropped; and his anxiety about it caused
him to return in search of the precious document.
Upon coming near enough to watch the movements of
Harlow's men, he waited till he saw them leave, and
then hastened thither to inquire if "Miss Sybil" had
seen any thing of any papers or letters after he had
left.</p>

<p>She gave him what he sought; and, little dreaming
that it had been opened, he eagerly seized it, and, with
many thanks, hastened away. But he had been so
delayed that he did not reach Wilson till some time
after dark. In the mean time, the finding of this letter
suggested to the mind of Harlow the idea of deceiving
the enemy by a similar <i>accident</i>, but done on purpose.

<!-- page 258 -->

He knew, that, as soon as the man missed his letter, he
would return to search for it; so, hastily drawing up a
fictitious plan of action for himself and men, he managed
to drop it just where the man could not very well
help finding it.</p>

<p>"Well, this is luck!" muttered the rebel scout to
himself: "my own paper safe, and the plans of those
d&mdash;d Yankees in my hands in the bargain!"</p>

<p>Wilson and his men were in high glee. "We will
trap them now, and that is certain," said Capt. Sam,
as he was familiarly called by his men. A part of the
plan marked down in the letter he had dropped, Major
Harlow carried out purposely; keeping his eye, the
while, on Wilson's movements, that he did not get the
advantage of him.</p>

<p>In this manner he was gradually drawing the latter
into a trap. But his plans were unexpectedly frustrated
by an incident that he had not counted on.
One of the men that he had selected was remarkably
swift of foot and sure of aim, but somewhat impulsive,
and a little careless, sometimes, about hearing straight.
One day, when they were out foraging, Harlow had
stopped with his men in an open plot of ground in a
field that had once been cultivated, but was now grown
over, mostly, with bushes and small trees. While
there, he wandered a little away from the rest; but,
ere many minutes, he returned with "Boys, take care
of yourselves: Wilson's men are right upon us; and
I'm not ready for him just yet." And, suiting the
action to the word, he leaped the nearest fence, and
disappeared in the woods.</p>

<p>Every man followed his example but the one above

<!-- page 259 -->

referred to,&mdash;Pipkin by name, or Pip, as he was called
for short. He did not start till every one else left;
but then, as if just waking up to the necessity of the
case, he measured off the ground so fast that he
outstripped many of the others. Upon reaching the
woods, they all skulked; but had had barely time to do
this, when Wilson and his men, twenty-five in number,
came into the little open space they had just vacated.</p>

<p>Harlow did not wish his men to discover themselves;
but Pipkin, finding a tree of sufficient size to protect
his body, just in range with them, and a limb upon it
just high enough to rest his gun, could not resist the
temptation to try his skill. So, before the others knew
what he was about, he had fired right in amongst
them. This so frightened them, that they broke and
ran. They could see no one; but the boldness of the
act, together with the fact that their leader was
wounded, took away all of their courage.</p>

<p>Wilson was hit in the thigh, and had barely got
under cover of the bushes, when he fell; and his men
had to carry him off. That night, Capt. Wilson was
carefully tended by Mrs. Benifield in an upper room
of the Benifield mansion, while Miss Sybil entertained
the Union major in the parlor.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Mrs. Benifield, as the pain he endured
extracted a groan from Capt. Sam. "Major
Harlow is below; and, if he should learn that you are
here, I don't know what the consequences would be to
us."</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n the major! I should like to put a ball through
him," was the irate reply; but Mrs. Benifield looked
so distressed, that he restrained himself after that.</p>

<!-- page 260 -->

<p>The judge and his daughter knew which side they
were on: Mrs. Benifield had but little preference in
either direction. She only wished to be let alone; but
she feared both parties, and did all that she could to
conciliate them. Her boys were not old enough to
fight, and she was glad of that.</p>

<p>Sybil and her father kept their own counsel; but
the mother believed that their sympathies were with
the South. "Mrs. Benifield," said Wilson at length,
"I wish you would go down and entertain that
Yankee, and let Miss Sybil come up here."</p>

<p>"It will not do, captain," she replied: "he would
miss her, and suspect something."</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n him!" he again muttered between his shut
teeth; and then, recollecting that it was not gentlemanly
to swear in the presence of ladies, "I beg your
pardon," he said; "but it is enough to drive a man
mad to have to lie here, and that man down there with
Miss Sybil."</p>

<p>"It will make no difference, captain. Sybil is not
a girl whose mind is easily changed: she thinks for
herself."</p>

<p>This did not comfort the captain much, but he was
obliged to be content. Could he have heard Sybil saying,
"When victory perches beside the eagle," and
have seen the light in Major Harlow's eye as she said
it, he would have felt much worse than he did.</p>

<p>But Harlow was not ignorant of Wilson's whereabouts,
nor of the fact, that, for fear of compromising
the safety of the family, he was to be removed to his
own retreat as soon as his condition would permit of it;
and he had laid his plans to take the rebel captain at

<!-- page 261 -->

that time. He succeeded in this to his heart's content;
and Col. Hazen was more than satisfied with the manner
in which he had executed the undertaking.</p>

<p>"I think, though, major, that you are determined
to secure your own reward," remarked the colonel
facetiously, as Charles asked leave to go to Judge
Benifield's about two weeks afterward.</p>

<p>"I will not pretend to misunderstand you, colonel,"
he replied, "and will answer you in her own words:
'When victory perches beside the eagle.' "</p>

<p>"Is it so? God bless you, Major Harlow! Miss
Sybil is worthy of any man's love," replied the colonel,
grasping his hand; "but, dem me, you've worked fast,
though."</p>

<p>"But you haven't told me if I can go," said Harlow
with a smile.</p>

<p>"Go! dear me, of course you can. Do you suppose
I want you running away, you rascal? I have
been young myself, and know that a pretty girl will
draw a chap farther than a four horse-team could. Go
along with you, boy."</p>

<p>Charles hurried away, with his heart full of glad
anticipations; but he was doomed to a trial he little
dreamed of. His leave of absence extended from
Saturday noon till Monday noon. It was about a week
after the surrender of Vicksburg; and, during the
second evening, the conversation turned upon the gallant
conduct of one of the highest officers, who had
risen by the force of merit, from a barefoot boy with
neither home nor friends, to the high position he then
occupied.</p>

<p>"I knew him when he was a boy of seven," said

<!-- page 262 -->

the judge; "and a sprightlier little fellow you seldom
see. He was living with his widowed mother then.
His father was an English gentleman's son, and was
disinherited for marrying beneath him. Being unused
to labor, he sickened and died from the hardships he
was obliged to endure. His mother lived on a few
years, and then went to join her husband, leaving little
George to the world's charity.</p>

<p>"This was in old Connecticut: and the overseers of
the poor bound him out to a hard master; and, poor
fellow, he had a hard time of it. But he has lived
through it all, and is now a great man. One can overcome
any obstacle but actual disgrace."</p>

<p>"Which do you mean, judge,&mdash;disgrace of birth, or
one's own conduct?" asked Charles, a quick pang
striking through his heart.</p>

<p>"Both, young man; both. The customs of society
may seem arbitrary; but still, we must bend to them.
A man whose mother has the fiftieth part of colored
blood in his veins, it matters not who his father
may be, can never rise."</p>

<p>"But suppose he gets his colored blood from his
father, instead of his mother?" asked Charles.</p>

<p>"That is hardly a supposable case, major; but, if
so, the mother is eternally disgraced, and the son
follows her condition."</p>

<p>"And in the case of illegitimacy, where both parents
were pure blood, your decision would be the
same?"</p>

<p>"It would: the child must follow the estate of the
mother."</p>

<p>Sybil looked disturbed, though she hardly knew

<!-- page 263 -->

why. And the thoughts that were running through
the mind of her lover were any thing but pleasant.
Presently Charles looked up. "Judge Benifield," said
he, "allow me to suppose a case,&mdash;one which, of course,
can never be; but we will imagine it, for the sake of
the question I wish to ask."</p>

<p>"Any thing you please, major," replied the judge
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"You believe in psychology, sir,&mdash;in the power of
one mind over another?"</p>

<p>"I believe that there is such a thing, though I can
not say that I understand it."</p>

<p>"Well, suppose that I do. I am engaged to your
daughter; and she has confidence in me as a man of
honor, or she would never have pledged herself to me.
But suppose that she is mistaken,&mdash;that I am a villain;
and, finding that she is subject to this psychological
influence, I use it upon her to her ruin; must she
and hers be for ever disgraced?"</p>

<p>The judge's feelings were evidently touched. "I
own," said he, "that it seems hard; but we couldn't set
aside the decision of society."</p>

<p>"And I"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I would shoot you as quick as I would a dog," was
the prompt reply.</p>

<p>Here the conversation was interrupted by the tunes
of the piano; and the evening passed off without further
reference to the subject. Charles Harlow passed a
sleepless night. His soul rose up in rebellion against
the injustice to which woman is thus subjected. "Talk
of chattel slavery!" he murmured: "where can we
find a more cruel slavery than this? But where is the

<!-- page 264 -->

voice bold enough to be lifted in the defense? where
the hand strong enough to break the chain?"</p>

<p>In the morning he was haggard from the effects of
his mental struggle. Sybil noticed it, and asked him if
he was sick.</p>

<p>"No, dearest; but I have something to say to you
after breakfast."</p>

<p>The morning meal was eaten in silence almost; for
there seemed to be a restraint upon all. When it was
over, they repaired to the parlor, while C&aelig;sar was told
to bring out the major's horse.</p>

<p>"Judge Benifield," said Charles, after they were
seated, "I have something to say to you,&mdash;something
that I can not with honor leave unsaid, after our conversation
last evening; but I hope that you will do me
the justice to believe that I have not intentionally deceived
you."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, for the pallor of Sybil's
face was unmanning him. The judge looked his astonishment;
while Mrs. Benifield glanced from one face to
the other in a sort of bewildered way.</p>

<p>"No," continued the young man: "I had no intention
of deceiving you, for I have been so accustomed to seeing
my mother treated with respect, that I never once
thought of it; but I am an illegitimate child."</p>

<p>There was evidently a conflict in the judge's mind;
but pride triumphed. "I am sorry that I did not know
of this sooner," he said at length; "for it would have
saved us all some painful feelings: but, of course, you
will resign all pretensions to my daughter's hand."</p>

<p>Charles turned and looked at Sybil. She left her seat
and walked directly to his side. "Major Harlow is my

<!-- page 265 -->

promised husband, father, and I shall not give him up."
Charles had risen to his feet; and, as she said this, he
threw his arm around her.</p>

<p>"Go to your room, girl!" thundered the judge,
angered at having his authority disputed. "Disgrace
has never yet been linked with the name of Benifield,
and I shall see to it that no daughter of mine mars the
record."</p>

<p>"I will obey you now, father; but when victory
perches beside the eagle, I shall be free to follow the
dictates of my own heart." She turned to Charles for a
parting kiss: he held her in his arms for a moment,
and then she hurried from the room; for the gathering
cloud upon her father's brow warned her of its necessity.</p>

<p>"Horse ready, sah!" said C&aelig;sar, thrusting his woolly
head into the door.</p>

<p>"Good-morning to you all," said Charles; and, walking
directly out of the house, he sprang into the saddle,
and was soon galloping toward Vicksburg.</p>

<p>About a week afterward, there was word brought to
him one evening, that a lady at the hotel wished to see
him. He wondered who it could be, but repaired immediately
thither. "Sybil! Miss Benifield!" he exclaimed,
as the figure upon the sofa arose and threw
back her veil. "What does it mean that I find you
here?"</p>

<p>"It means, Major Harlow, that the spirit of the Benifields
is aroused, and one will not yield to the other."</p>

<p>"What! How?" he asked, still at a loss to divine
her meaning.</p>

<p>"Nothing: only my father has confined me to my

<!-- page 266 -->

room since you left, determined to make me promise to
give you up; but to-day he had to leave upon business,
and I escaped, and have come to you."</p>

<p>"My own brave girl! will you give me the right to
protect you from this time forth?" said he, taking her
hand in his.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, major! it is hardly necessary for me to
break my word in one direction for the sake of keeping
it in another. I promised my father that I would not
marry any one till I was at least eighteen years of age."</p>

<p>But what will you do, my darling?"</p>

<p>"Give me a pass for my passage North, and let me
go to your mother. I would not ask even this, major,
if I had the money to go without it."</p>

<p>"My mother is in one of the hospitals at Washington,
as nurse, Sybil."</p>

<p>"Well, Charles, let me go there and share her duties.
I have often felt that I would like to do something for
the brave boys who are laying their all upon their
country's altar."</p>

<p>He looked at her to see if she was really in earnest.
"I mean it," said she, smiling back upon him.</p>

<p>"I see that you do," he replied; "but I hardly think
it best. Let me make a proposition."</p>

<p>"Speak on, Sir Wisdom, and I will listen."</p>

<p>"Not if you banter me that way, miss."</p>

<p>"But I really wish you to, sir."</p>

<p>"Your wishes are commands, fair lady," he replied
in the same tone. "My mother is wearing herself out,
and I wish her to go home; but she will not go to stay
there alone. I propose, therefore, that you go to her,
taking a letter from me,&mdash;that is, if I can not get leave

<!-- page 267 -->

to go with you. I will send a letter, introducing you
as my promised wife, and ask her to go home and take
you with her."</p>

<p>"You wish this for your mother's sake?" she asked.</p>

<p>"For my mother's sake, and yours too."</p>

<p>"I did not ask the question, major, because I was
jealous of your love to your mother; but simply that
I might decide as to whether I had better accept your
proposition or not. For myself, I had rather stay
where I can be doing something; but if you really feel
that your mother ought to go home, and there is no
other way to induce her to do so, I will do as you suggest."</p>

<p>He looked at her in surprise. "My own Sybil, I
am proud of your thoughtful consideration. I love my
mother; she is worthy of a son's love and devotion:
but I feared, after what has passed, that you might feel
a little prejudice toward her."</p>

<p>"I did at first, Charles, and am free to confess it:
but I have had plenty of time to think while alone by
myself; and I have come to the conclusion that the
woman who can maintain her integrity after having
been thus wronged,&mdash;and this with all the pressure
that is brought to bear against her,&mdash;I have come to the
conclusion that such a woman is much more worthy of
respect than one who has never been tried."</p>

<p>"If the world would all take that position," said he,
with tears in his eyes, "it would save many a poor
creature from despair."</p>

<p>"Lady below wishes to see Major Harlow," said the
waiter at this moment, throwing open the door.</p>

<p>"Who can it be?" exclaimed Charles, starting to
his feet.</p>

<!-- page 268 -->

<p>"Some old sweetheart, I presume," said Sybil with
a laugh.</p>

<p>"What shall I tell her, sir?" asked the waiter.</p>

<p>"Show her up here," replied Harlow; and then,
turning to Sybil, "You will have a chance to see for
yourself what kind of a sweetheart it is."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow, how it is plagued now!" she replied
with another laugh.</p>

<p>Here the approach of footsteps prevented further
conversation, and the eyes of both were fixed upon
the door. A middle-aged lady entered; and Charles,
with one bound, clasped her in his arms. "Mother, dear
mother! is it you?" The first greeting over, he turned
with, "My mother, Miss Benifield: my promised
wife, mother."</p>

<p>Helen received Sybil with a warmth that won her
heart entirely. "And now," said Charles, seating
himself between them, "mother dear, I wish to know
how it happens that you came just when we need you
so much."</p>

<p>"I came, my son, because I was hungry for the
sight of you, and because I could not hear from you."</p>

<p>"Could not hear from me!"</p>

<p>"No: I have not had a letter from you these six
weeks."</p>

<p>"Strange, when I have written to you as often as
every ten days, and sometimes more frequently. Why
did you not tell me that you did not receive my letters,
mother?"</p>

<p>"You have received mine, then?"</p>

<p>"All of them; or, at least, as many as usual."</p>

<p>"I did not mention it, because I knew, that, if you did

<!-- page 269 -->

not receive mine, it would be of no use; and if you did,
that yours were probably delayed somewhere, and
would come at last: so I did not wish to trouble you.
But when the papers announced the fall of Vicksburg,
and still no word, I thought it was time to be looking
up my truant."</p>

<p>"Never truant from you, mother. But I can not
imagine what has become of my letters," said Charles
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"But for what were you wanting mother so much?"</p>

<p>He now explained Sybil's position, avoiding the
cause of the judge's opposition, of course; and expressed
his desire that his mother should go home, and take
Sybil with her.</p>

<p>"Have you told her all, my son?" asked Helen.</p>

<p>"All, mother," he replied.</p>

<p>"And are you willing to go with me, my child?"
she asked, turning to Sybil.</p>

<p>"If you will take me, mother," she answered.</p>

<p>Helen clasped the fair girl's hand in silence; for her
heart was too full for speech.</p>

<p>And so it was decided that Helen Harlow should go
back to New Hampshire, taking Sybil Benifield with
her as "one of the principal results of the major's
scouting expedition," laughed Col. Hazen, when he
heard of the arrangement.</p>

<p>They tarried several days, however, visiting the
principal places of interest; and, when they left, Charles
went with them as far as Cincinnati.</p>

<p>Judge Benifield came to Vicksburg during the time,
and had one stormy interview with his daughter. But
she refused to return home with him, and the feeling

<!-- page 270 -->

was too strong against him for him to attempt to take
her forcibly.</p>

<p>"Dem fool! dem me if he isn't!" muttered Col.
Hazen.</p>

<p>"Col. Hazen never swears," said Charles demurely.</p>

<p>"No, major, dem'd if I do; my mother taught me
better," was the rather comical reply,&mdash;a reply that
was received with roars of laughter.</p>

<p>"Look here, Major Harlow: you haven't got leave
to go to Cincinnati yet; and dem me if you do, if you
keep on in this way. Shouldn't go anyhow, if it wasn't
for the respect I have for that mother of yours."</p>

<p>"Smitten, ha! I think some one of us had better
inform Mrs. Hazen, so that she can come and take care
of you," said one of his brother-officers sportively.</p>

<p>"Would to God that you could bring her here!" he
exclaimed, dashing the tears from his weather-beaten
cheek. "But no; I am selfish to wish it: she is now
an angel in heaven."</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXI.</p>

<p class="small">HOME AGAIN.&mdash;A SUPPLIANT.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p class="small">"Where we have scorned, we yet shall bow the knee. The crown of thorns
shall to a crown of glory change, when long enough it has been bathed in blood
drawn from the living fountain of long-suffering souls; when man, proud man,
shall learn that through the woman heart must flow the stream which maketh
glad the city of our God, ere yet the serpent's fangs have ceased to sting."&mdash;L. W.</p>

<br/>

<p>HELEN reached her home in safety, and
was welcomed upon all sides with a warmth
which made her feel that she had indeed
triumphed. As for Sybil, notwithstanding
the respect which she had conceived for her
prospective mother, she was more than surprised, she was
astonished, at the evidences of regard everywhere manifest.
Rich and poor, old and young, hailed her coming
alike; and Lakeside seemed almost the scene of a jubilee.</p>

<p>And Sybil too, "our captain's promised wife," as
they called her. "But he is major now," said black Susan,
as jealous for the family honor as was ever any
Southern slave.</p>

<p>"Well, captain or major, it makes no difference, Susan.
I presume he will be colonel, if not general, when
he returns; but he is ours: we have known him from
a boy, and know that he deserves all the honor he gets."</p>

<p>Susan well remembered when they did not look upon

<!-- page 272 -->

it as an honor that he was born among them; but she
wisely forbore any comments. Sybil, too, was everywhere
received with favor; and she had not been at
Lakeside six months, when she was not only surprised,
but delighted, to see her father walk into Helen's little
shop.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, child," said he: "your poor old
father couldn't do without you very well, and has concluded
to stop playing the fool, by giving his consent to
your marrying worth instead of name."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad, father!" said Sybil, between
tears and smiles. "But how are mother and the boys?"</p>

<p>"They are well, you willful puss; and I think I shall
bring them up here, for I like the looks of the country."</p>

<p>"O father! I wish you would."</p>

<p>"Well, you needn't go into ecstasies over it; but
they are in Boston now."</p>

<p>"In Boston! Have you really left the South?"</p>

<p>"Yes: it was getting too hot for me. The rebs have
found out, somehow, what a game we had been playing
them, Syb,&mdash;you and I (you know mother never had
any thing to do with it); well, they have found it out,
and have sworn vengeance.</p>

<p>"It was only three weeks ago, that, hadn't it been for
the young major, we should all have been murdered in
cold blood, and the house burned over our heads. But
he found it out in some way, and, with a dozen good fellows,
came galloping up just in time to save us.</p>

<p>"Says I to myself, when I learned all about it, 'Tom
Benifield, you are an old fool, if you are judge. Little
Syb has got out of their reach, and you had better be
doing the same.' So here I am; and your mother and
the boys will be here soon."</p>

<!-- page 273 -->

<p>"When, father? Who is coming with them?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it will hardly do to tell you every thing
at once," replied the old man in a teazing tone.</p>

<p>"Sybil, my darling, Charles is coming home on a furlough:
he&mdash;How do you do, Judge Benifield? I beg
your pardon for not seeing you; but I was so intent
on the contents of this letter."</p>

<p>"No excuses, Miss Harlow," stammering over the
"<i>Miss</i>" a little, in spite of himself: "no excuses; and I
ask your pardon for my unreasonable opposition to your
son's suit. It is time that we learned better than to
make children suffer for a father's rascality."</p>

<p>Sybil colored. "I do not think, father, that mother
has been informed of the cause of your opposition."</p>

<p>"I can easily infer it," replied Helen with a smile;
"and am glad, Judge Benifield, that you have learned
the lesson which many others need to learn, and must,
before woman can have justice done her. As for myself,
I am happy to meet you as a friend; and, if you
bring your family here, I beg of you to accept the hospitality
of my poor home, till you can provide a better."</p>

<p>"Thank you from my heart, madam,&mdash;or&mdash;miss;
but I think you have a part of my family now," replied
he, trying to hide his embarrassment at his awkwardness
by a laugh.</p>

<p>"I claim Sybil as mine," she answered, giving her a
fond look; "but I like the Quaker style of address,
judge; and, if you please, you may call me Helen."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Helen: I will try to remember."</p>

<p>Charles came the next day, bringing with him Mrs.
Benifield and the boys; and, for the time, there was no

<!-- page 274 -->

happier company in all the land than the one covered
by Helen Harlow's roof.</p>

<p>How events are crowded together in some periods of
life! Like the ripening harvests after a season of toil,
they hurry us with the gathering, till our granaries are
full and running over, and we hardly know what to do
with the excess.</p>

<p>Charles had been at home but two or three days,
before the people of Lakeside had their curiosity aroused
by seeing Mr. Granger of Albright at Helen's door.
Helen herself was at a loss to know the meaning of
this visit. Still, she received him with a kind cordiality
which was natural to her, and introduced him to her
friends.</p>

<p>Charles was absent with the judge; and that personage,
upon his return, opened his eyes a little wider than
usual, to see a stranger step up and grasp the major's
hand, with a "God bless you, my son!"</p>

<p>Charles returned the salutation, and, turning to the
judge, said, "Judge Benifield, my father, Mr. Granger
of Albright."</p>

<p>"You look surprised, Mr. Benifield; and well you
may: but, twenty-five years ago, I made as big a fool of
myself as any one man ever did. There has not been
a month since that time but I have regretted it: and,
could I make peace with the woman I then so deeply
wronged, it would be the crowning of my life; but it is
a greater boon than I dare ask."</p>

<p>"You will pardon me, sir, if I speak plainly?"
asked the judge.</p>

<p>"Most assuredly, sir: you can not place my conduct
before me in a worse light than I see it myself."</p>

<!-- page 275 -->

<p>"Why do you come here, then?"</p>

<p>"Why do I come here?" repeated Granger in a tone
of surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued the judge: "it seems to me like
an insult, under the circumstances. You have a wife
and family, I believe?"</p>

<p>"I understand you now, sir. I have a family; but I
have never been here before, and should not have come
now, had Mrs. Granger lived."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Mr. Granger: that puts the
thing in quite a different light. But why not do her
justice by marrying her now?"</p>

<p>"That is the point, judge. She has done herself
justice, has forced the world to recognize her worth;
and she does not need justice from me. The honor
would be all on the other side."</p>

<p>Helen at this point left the room, and Charles followed
her. Sybil would have gone too; but she did not
feel quite free to do so.</p>

<p>"You do not mean to say, Mr. Granger, that she
would not marry you?" exclaimed the judge.</p>

<p>"I mean to say, that, if she would, it would not be
because she demanded recognition, or even accepted
it through marriage; for she would honor me by so
doing, more than I could possibly honor her."</p>

<p>"Strange, strange!" murmured the judge, more to
himself than to Granger; then, looking up, "Are you
afraid to ask her, sir?"</p>

<p>"I am ashamed to ask her, sir."</p>

<p>"My daughter, here, has taken a notion to your boy,
Mr. Granger; and I guess if you will make both of the
children your allies, you need not fear the result."</p>

<!-- page 276 -->

<p>Sybil, at this, left the room; and, going directly to
Helen, she put both arms around her neck, saying,
"Mother, I have a request to make."</p>

<p>"What is it, my child?"</p>

<p>"But will you grant it?" persisted Sybil.</p>

<p>"How am I to tell, dear, until I know what it is?"</p>

<p>"I want another father!" Helen looked up to meet
the eye of Granger: he was standing in the door.
When Sybil left the room, her father caught the flash of
her eye, and divined her intention; and so motioned
Granger to follow.</p>

<p>"I wonder if it will have any weight if I add my request
to hers," he said.</p>

<p>"I rather suspect that you sent her," replied Helen,
trying to appear calm.</p>

<p>"I did not, Helen; but I would send a dozen like her,
if I thought it would do any good." His voice trembled
with suppressed emotion; and she felt that she must not
trifle with him.</p>

<p>"Do you wish it, children?" she said, turning to
Charles and Sybil.</p>

<p>"If it will add to your happiness, we do," was the
response from both.</p>

<p>Still she hesitated; but his pleading eyes were upon
her, and she finally said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have always loved you, Edward; but the time has
been when I should have given the most emphatic 'No'
to a question like this. The longer I live, however,
the more I am convinced that you have been wronged,
as well as myself."</p>

<p>"How?" he asked, wondering if her thoughts had
taken the same direction, as his sometimes had.</p>

<!-- page 277 -->

<p>"Society," she replied, "in crushing the woman
while it accepts the man, in a measure tempted you to
do as you did."</p>

<p>"True, true,&mdash;every word of it. But it could not
crush you, Helen; while I have suffered, God only knows
how much!"</p>

<p>"It could not crush me, because I would not be
crushed," she replied.</p>

<p>"True; and I wish every wronged woman would
take the same stand. But you have not answered my
question, Helen."</p>

<p>Again there was a hesitancy, as though she could
hardly bring herself to say the words. "I suppose it
must be as the children wish," she answered at length.</p>

<p>"At last!" he murmured, taking her hand in his,&mdash;the
first time he had done so since that night of the so
long ago,&mdash;the night on which the story opens. Some
thought of that time seemed to stir him; for he said, "O
Helen! I am humbled when I think of the truthfulness
of your life as compared with the falseness of mine."</p>

<p>"Society forced me to be true to myself, or sink;
while it held you up, sustained you in the wrong," she
replied.</p>

<p>"No more of this laying my guilt upon the public,"
he said, playfully covering her lips with his hand. "If society
tempted me, I sinned, and I have suffered. 'The
<i>soul</i> that sinneth' is the declaration. Do you think, if
I should be <i>tempted</i> to put my hand upon a red-hot
stove at your suggestion, that it would be burnt any the
less on that account?"</p>

<p>"Well, never mind the philosophy now. If it is to be
as the children say, I want it when the children say too;

<!-- page 278 -->

and I should like to have things settled before I go South
again," said Charles.</p>

<p>"Nothing would suit me better, my boy. What say
you, Helen?"</p>

<p>"You say, 'the children,' and don't even ask my
opinion. I did not suppose that man and wife were one,
and that one the husband, till they were married, at
least," said Sybil, with a pretty pout upon her lips.</p>

<p>"You forget that it was included in your request to
mother when you first came in," replied Charles. "But
I should like nothing better than to have the children
made one at the same time. What say you, my Sybil?"</p>

<p>Sybil blushed, but replied gayly, "The conditions
are not fulfilled yet, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, they are: victory has perched beside the
eagle several times since then."</p>

<p>"But you well know that that was not what I intended;
and, if I begin by allowing you to resort to subterfuge,
there is no knowing what liberties you will take
after a while. No, sir: you must wait the appointed
time."</p>

<p>Charles looked disappointed; but the judge, who had
come into the room in time to hear the last part of the
conversation, laughed heartily. "That's right, puss,"
said he: "make him toe the mark while you can; for
you will have to yield enough in the end."</p>

<p>"I wish Charles to be recognized under his right
name before they are married," said Granger.</p>

<p class="small">"Oh, how humble when they woo us!<br/>

Oh, how proud when they succeed!"</p>

<p>repeated Helen.</p>

<!-- page 279 -->

<p>Granger looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>"You talk of my <i>honoring</i> you," she replied: "still,
my identity must disappear. I must take your name,
go to your home; and my child must bear his father's
name, or he is <i>disgraced</i>."</p>

<p>"I know it, Helen," said he. "I know that it is unjust.
What have I done, these twenty-five years, to add
to the honor of the name of Granger? Nothing, nothing
at all. If I have maintained it intact, I have done well.
I stand no higher to-day than when I first knew you;
while you have risen triumphant over difficulties that
have hitherto been considered insurmountable. And
now, even your name must go, if you honor me with
your hand. I feel, almost, as if I was committing sacrilege
to ask it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you had better relinquish your claim," said
she mischievously.</p>

<p>"I am too selfish for that, Helen. It is said, that,
when a man marries, socially speaking, he brings his
wife to his level: if above her, she rises; if beneath
her, she sinks. And I think you will have to be content
to sink to my level; for I can see no way in which I can
rise to yours."</p>

<p>"But we will thank God, Edward, that social levels
and real levels are two things," was her earnest reply.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said the judge: "you Northerners have
very utopian ideas, I must say. I expect you will be
setting up some woman for president yet."</p>

<p>"And, if elected, if she could not do better in that
capacity than some of the men who have <i>held</i>&mdash;I will
not say <i>filled</i>&mdash;that office, I should advise her not to try
it the second time," retorted Helen.</p>

<!-- page 280 -->

<p>Charles and Granger laughed heartily at this, and the
judge made no further comment.</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon's services, as a matter of course, were
brought into requisition; and there was a quiet wedding
in the parlor over the little shop, on the following week.</p>

<p>"Three funerals, and then a wedding," said the reverend
gentleman playfully. "Are we to have two more
weddings to follow this, so as to make matters even?"
glancing at Charles and Sybil.</p>

<p>"I can see indications of but one more," answered
Granger. "But you forget, sir, that one wedding is
equal to two funerals."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"A funeral is for one person, and a wedding for two."</p>

<p>"True, Mr. Granger; but the <i>two</i> are made <i>one</i>."</p>

<p>" 'I see, I see,' said the blind man," he replied.</p>

<br/>

<p>Charles saw his mother settled in her new home, and
then returned to his post, bearing letters to his superior
officers, which, in his next promotion, secured his commission
as Col. Charles H. Granger, in the place of
Charles E. Harlow.</p>

<p>Judge Benifield and his family remained at Lakeside,
in Helen's old home; and Sybil, no longer afraid of being
separated from her affianced, staid with them.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gordon visited Helen a few weeks after
she went to Albright; and the gentleman said, "I think,
Mrs. Granger, it is about time that we settled those
questions, solved those problems, about which we have
talked in the past."</p>

<p>"I am ready to give you the result of my observations
and meditations at any time, sir; but I shall not promise

<!-- page 281 -->

to make you see as I do. Each one must reach his
own decision through his own experiences; and each
decision thrown out upon the great mass of mind produces
its own effect."</p>

<p>"Suppose, then, that we devote this evening to that
purpose. Mrs. Gordon, will you and Mr. Granger
join us?"</p>

<p>"I prefer to be a listener."</p>

<p>"And I too," responded Granger.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXII.</p>

<p class="small">PROBLEMS.&mdash;CONCLUSION.</p>

</div>

<br/>

<p class="small">"The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head."&mdash;BIBLE.</p>

<p class="small">"Great is the mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh."&mdash;BIBLE.</p>

<br/>

<p>EVENING came; and, seated around the
pleasant room in familiar conversation,
the time was fast passing, when Mrs.
Gordon said, "It seems to me that you
have forgotten the subject of the hour: at
least, you are not discussing problems."</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon looked as if he hardly knew where to
commence; and Helen said, "I am waiting for the
question."</p>

<p>"Question!" said Granger.</p>

<p>"Echo!" laughed Gordon.</p>

<p>Granger looked as if he did not quite understand the
joke; and Mrs. Gordon enlightened him by saying,
"Husband is laughing because you repeated Helen's last
word so promptly."</p>

<p>"Oh! is that all? Well, if I never echo any thing but
what comes from her lips, I shall never be ashamed of
my echo."</p>

<p>"Never mind the echo: let us have the question,"
said Helen.</p>

<!-- page 283 -->

<p>"I think, Mrs. Granger, that some of the questions
of the past have come from you," Mr. Gordon replied.</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to answer my own questions and
yours too, sir?"</p>

<p>"That would be hardly fair, I acknowledge; but do
you recollect what my first question was?"</p>

<p>"I think it was something about my being a Christian;
was it not?"</p>

<p>"Something to that effect, I believe."</p>

<p>"And you grieved over my blindness in not seeing
the need of a Saviour?"</p>

<P>"I did, Mrs. Granger."</p>

<p>"But confessed that you could not understand the
theology you taught?"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Did you not confess that you must say with Paul,
'Great is the mystery of godliness'?"</p>

<p>"I believe I did."</p>

<p>"And still you teach that only through this&mdash;through
God manifest in the flesh&mdash;is there salvation
for man."</p>

<p>"That is the teaching of the Bible, as I understand
it."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Gordon, I believe this to be true; but it
is no longer a mystery to me."</p>

<p>"You have experienced religion, then?"</p>

<p>Helen laughed, and asked, "How do you arrive at
such a conclusion?"</p>

<p>"Because only those who have experienced a change
of heart can understand what it means."</p>

<p>"Must I conclude then, that, after all these years of
preaching, you have not experienced that change, Mr.
Gordon?"</p>

<!-- page 284 -->

<p>He saw the point, and colored, but made no reply;
while she continued: "Do not suppose, Mr. Gordon,
that I must necessarily see this subject, solve this mystery,
from your stand-point. In the first place, I must tell
you that it is from the hells of earth that we need salvation.
If we save ourselves, as a race, from these hells,
by destroying them, removing their causes, we have
laid the ax at the root of the tree, and it will not take
long for the branches to perish."</p>

<p>"Must save ourselves, did you say, Helen?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and through God manifest in the flesh."</p>

<p>"That is, we must lay hold on Jesus?"</p>

<p>"Only so far as we can avail ourselves of the wisdom
of God as manifested in him."</p>

<p>"But in him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead
bodily."</p>

<p>"It might have <i>dwelt</i> in him, Mr. Gordon; but the
wisdom of God&mdash;<i>enough</i> of that wisdom to save us from
the earthly hells to which we are subject&mdash;certainly
was not all <i>manifested</i> through him."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Mrs. Granger?"</p>

<p>"I mean just what I say, Mr. Gordon. The difference
between us is this: you recognize the man Jesus as
the Saviour; I, on the other hand, recognize the power,
justice, love, and wisdom of God, whether manifested
through Jesus or through any other channel. I recognize
God manifest in the flesh, in or through all humanity,
as the Saviour of humanity. In other words,
this Christ must be born in us, be manifest through us,
each and every one, before we can be saved as a race,
not from future, but present hells."</p>

<p>"But what of future hells, Helen?"</p>

<!-- page 285 -->

<p>"We must be saved from them through God manifest
in the spirit."</p>

<p>"I must confess that I can not understand you," said
Mr. Gordon, after a moment's thought.</p>

<p>"Do you ever expect to see God, Mr. Gordon?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, I do."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"As manifested through Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>"A personal, individual God: where, then, is the infinite?"</p>

<p>"Where? Everywhere."</p>

<p>"Then you will see in Jesus only what is manifested
through Jesus; in Paul, as much of God as is manifested
through Paul; and so on: thus you can never
really and truly see God till you have seen all that
there is, has been, or ever shall be."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right, if you take it in that
sense."</p>

<p>"Acknowledge, then, that we can see God only as
manifest in his works, and can be saved by God only
as he manifests himself through us."</p>

<p>"How manifest through us, Mrs. Granger?"</p>

<p>"Man possesses, in a finite degree, all the powers, elements,
that we recognize in the Infinite. Is not this
true, sir?</p>

<p>"I believe that it is, Helen."</p>

<p>"And just as far as these elements are manifest here
in the flesh, just so far is God manifest in the flesh;
and when there is enough of these elements, these powers,
enough of power, justice, love, and wisdom, manifested
through the human family as a whole, and in
harmonious proportions,&mdash;power, justice, and wisdom,

<!-- page 286 -->

each and all ruled by love,&mdash;then, and not till then,
will God be fully manifest in the flesh, to the redemption
of humanity."</p>

<p>"But how is this to be done, Mrs. Granger?"</p>

<p>"Through suffering; through those experiences which
bring self-assertion in accordance with the right; through
those teachings which tend to bring into action the 'I
am' within, causing the soul to say, 'I looked, and there
was none to help: I wondered that there was none to
uphold, and mine own arm' (or, in other words, God
manifest through myself,&mdash;my flesh) 'brought salvation.' "</p>

<p>"I don't know but you are right. The recognition
of what we have been taught to look upon as a specialty,
as a universal principle, may be the true theory, after
all," was Mr. Gordon's thoughtful remark.</p>

<p>"Suppose, then," said Helen, "that we leave this
point, and take up another?"</p>

<p>"Well, what shall it be?" he replied.</p>

<p>"Why is there so much difference made between man
and woman, in the punishment accorded by society for
the violation of the law of purity?"</p>

<p>"I will own, Mrs. Granger, that I can not answer that
question, and so will wait for you."</p>

<p>"There are two reasons, sir. First, we find that the
ruling class always claim immunity for acts that would
be condemned in the class ruled."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Mrs. Granger: you do not pretend to
say that man exerts a greater influence than woman?"</p>

<p>We were not talking of influence, but of power. The
king's mistress may exert a mighty influence over him
so long as she pleases him; and all who desire the king's

<!-- page 287 -->

favor will flatter her: but let her displease him, and her
influence is gone, while those who desire his favor will
be more bitter toward her than even the king himself.
Man, in our present state of society, so far as the law-making
and the money-making power is concerned,&mdash;in
both of these, at least, he is king, and woman the subject;
consequently, man can do with impunity what
woman is crushed for doing."</p>

<p>"And what is the other reason? You said there
were two."</p>

<p>"Womanly purity is of more importance to the race.
Society is injured more through her downfall than his."</p>

<p>"I know that the mother has more influence over the
child in its earlier years than man has; and, as early
impressions are the strongest, last the longest, of course
it must be of importance to the world that she makes the
right impression."</p>

<p>"The real cause lies farther back, goes deeper than
the simple influence brought to bear upon the minds of
the young. Have you ever thought why it is that
woman is so much more susceptible than man? has so
sensitive an organization?&mdash;why it is that people say,
'As nervous as a woman'?"</p>

<p>"I have supposed it was because she was weaker."</p>

<p>"But why? There is a cause for every thing,&mdash;a
reason why."</p>

<p>"I can not tell: I have never thought upon it."</p>

<p>"Did you ever have your likeness taken?"</p>

<p>"Of course, I have. Did not I give you one of mine
and wife's the last time you were at Glencove?"</p>

<p>"You did. I simply asked the question for the sake
of an illustration. Do you know why the artist is so

<!-- page 288 -->

careful to keep the light from the prepared plate till it
reaches a certain point of development?"</p>

<p>"I do not know exactly why, but because it will
spoil the effect in some way."</p>

<p>"That plate is exceedingly sensitive to the action of
light,&mdash;as sensitive as a woman's nerves. Every ray
of light that reaches it makes its impression upon it.
If you want your likeness taken, you dress accordingly;
and you are very careful that nothing comes between
your person and the lens of the camera.</p>

<p>"What, suppose you, Mr. Gordon, would be the
effect if a serpent should be so placed as to come
between your face and the lens, or glass, which reflects
the light, carrying it through to the sensitized plate?"</p>

<p>"Why, I should have the picture of a serpent across
my face, of course."</p>

<p>"Is there no process by means of which this could be
prevented?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I do not know; but I hardly think that there is,
Mrs. Granger."</p>

<p>"I think I see what application you are going to
make of that, Helen," said Mrs. Gordon.</p>

<p>"Simply this," replied Helen: "woman's fine nervous
organization is the lens of the camera; and the
unborn babe is the sensitized plate prepared in the dark
room of Nature's laboratory, to receive through this
lens&mdash;the mother's nervous organization&mdash;the light,
the influences that are reflected from the outer world.
If, then, she becomes deranged, or is surrounded by
degrading influences, the child inherits this as a part of
itself; even as the serpent, in the illustration given
becomes a part of the picture."</p>

<!-- page 289 -->

<p>Granger had been silent till now, but watching and
listening the while, as though an angel were speaking.
At the conclusion of her illustration, he drew a long
breath, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who but you, Helen, would ever have thought of
such a thing?"</p>

<p>"How true to Nature, though!" added Mrs. Gordon.</p>

<p>"And in perfect keeping with poor Jane's story,"
continued Helen: "and it was what she said that first
set me to reasoning upon this question, in a way that
could give me an understanding of woman's true
work."</p>

<p>"What do you claim that work to be?" asked Mr.
Gordon.</p>

<p>"The redemption of the race; the bruising of the
serpent's head through the laws of maternity."</p>

<p>"The guardian angel of the fireside. I am glad, Mrs.
Granger, that you have come to so reasonable a conclusion.
I began to fear that you were affected with this
'Woman's Rights' mania.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gordon, do you think that it was right for the
Egyptians to demand bricks of the Israelites, and at the
same time withhold the straw?"</p>

<p>Granger laughed outright, and Mr. Gordon looked
confused. "I don't see the bearing of that question,"
he said.</p>

<p>"When woman has the <i>power</i> to protect the household,
when she has the right to the <i>law-making, law-enforcing
power</i>, when she stands before the law her
own protector,&mdash;then, and not till then, can she become
the guardian angel of the household; then, and not
till then, can she say to the serpents of lust and sensuality,

<!-- page 290 -->

'Stand back! come not between me and my work;'
then, and not till then, can she so control the love of
power in man, as to keep herself from becoming his
victim. But, till that time comes, she must refuse
utterly to become mother, or she must make bricks
without straw; must transmit lust and sensuality;
must be subject to the serpent influences that come up
from those earthly hells into which man continues to
rush, and to drag her with him when he can."</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon did not respond further, but sat in
thoughtful silence; while his wife and Granger laughingly
declared that Helen had come off victor.</p>

<p>This was the first of many conversations held upon
this subject: for Mr. Gordon was not the man to yield a
point readily, but, when once convinced, was free to
acknowledge it; and to-day he is a strong advocate of
suffrage for woman.</p>

<p class="center">. . . . . . . . .</p>

<p>Our story is done, or so nearly so, that we have but
to say, that, when victory perched beside the eagle,
Sybil redeemed her pledge, and, with Charles's parents
and her own, returned to the sunny South. There the
three families are now living, and happy, with the
exception of but one cloud: Herbert Granger's fate is
unknown. His father and brother mourn for him, and,
of course, the others sympathize in their sorrow.</p>
