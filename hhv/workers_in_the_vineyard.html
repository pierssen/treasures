<p>That Mrs. Schlesinger desires to put
me into her book as one of the workers
in the vineyard of reform, is of itself
sufficient honor, and as I desire to live
more in my work than in my personality, 
and further, as I shrink from
having my name go to posterity coupled
with the too partial estimate of friends
who are inclined to enlarge virtues and
forget faults, I will myself say what
needs to be said, but it will necessarily
be more of my general than of my California 
work.</p>

<p>As to myself, I made my entrance
into this life on the 1st day of February, 
1826, in the town of Catharine,
Schuyler County (then a part of Tioga),
N. Y., as the first of seven children
born to Caroline and Grandisen Nichols.</p>

<p>My mother's maiden name was Reed,
and though their children were all
Methodists, her father and mother were
among the first Universalists of the
country. It was my talks with my
grandfather the summer of his eighty-first 
year, which helped to break me
from the bondage of church teachings.</p>

<p>The death of a brother-in-law, with
the circumstances attending, had prepared 
the way for his words to take
effect. This brother-in-law, who was a
good husband, son and brother, died
believing he was going to hell, because
he had never been converted.</p>

<p>The first links broken, the investigation 
of Spiritualism in 1856 completed
the work so well begun. Among the
first evidences received was a communication
from that brother-in-law.</p>

<!-- page 173 col 2 -->

<p>My parents were poor, uneducated,
hard-working people, my father supporting 
his family as a day laborer&mdash;a
wage slave&mdash;and as a matter of course
my advantages were but few. It is the
memory of my father's unrequited toil,
of how much he did and how little he
received, which intensifies my opposition 
to an economic
system which so robs the toiler.</p>

<p>My parents gave me the name of
Adeline Eliza, but when at twenty-eight 
years of age I began to write over
the signature of "Lois," my friends
commenced calling me that, and I soon
adopted it; so it is now nearly forty
years since I discarded my baptismal
name, as I have since discarded Christianity 
in all its forms. The good connected 
with it belongs to universal humanity, 
not to a sect of people who
have shed rivers of blood to enforce
their propaganda.</p>

<p>I was always called peculiar. How
much of that peculiarity belongs to
myself, and how much of it comes
from the influence of those who were
once denizens of earth, and who now
hold me to the work for which they
have helped to prepare me, I cannol
say, but I have always wanted to write.
The school composition, as it was
called, while a terror to many, was a
pleasure to me.</p>

And now, dismissing myself as far as
possible, turn to that in which I have
lived most, to that which I have felt
impelled to write. My first effort outside 
the newspaper column was an anti-slavery 
Sabbath-school book called

<!-- page 174 col 1 -->

"Mary and Ellen; or, The Orphan
Girls," which, the last I knew of it,
was being extensively used in the Sabbath 
schools of our Congregationalist
friends, I being at the time of its writing 
a member of that church.</p>

<p>My second book, "Alice Vale," was
written to illustrate Spiritualism. It
is now out of print, as is "Mayweed
Blossoms," a collection of fugitive
pieces, of which I thought more than
did others, as the meagreness of its sale
proved, and also, as is "Nothing Like
It; or, Steps to the Kingdom," an earnest 
but somewhat crude effort to give a
glimpse of purity in freedom, in the
relation of the sexes.</p>

<p>Those will probably never be reissued.</p>

<p>"Helen Harlow's Vow" was written
to show that woman should refuse to
submit to the injustice which condemns
her, and accepts the man for the same
act&mdash;the heroine determining that she
will not sink because she has foolishly
trusted; that she will be just to herself
if others are unjust to her. She maintains 
her self-respect, and in the end
commands the respect of all who know
her.</p>

<p>"Perfect Motherhood; or, Mabel Raymond's 
Resolve," does not trench upon
the province of the physician, but takes
up the conditions of society which
make it impossible that mothers shall
transmit, through the law of heredity,
the elements of character which, unfolded, 
would give the world a superior
race of men and women.</p>

<p>"The Occult Forces of Sex" is a work
which is more valued each year, in
proof of which I will state that the
year after the last part was written,
something over five years since, there
were less than 200 sold with my personal 
effort, added to what was done
by others; but during the last two years
the sales have been encouraging in the
extreme.</p>

<p>This little book consists of three
pamphlets&mdash;one written in Battle
Creek, Michigan, in 1873, and called
"The Sex Question and the Money

<!-- page 174 col 2 -->

Power;" the second at Riverside, California, 
in 1880, and called "From Generation 
to Regeneration," (and really
the most valuable of my California
work), and the third at Milwaukee,
Oregon, in 1889, and called "The Tree
of Life Between Two Thieves."</p>

<p>I have good evidence that Alexander
von Humboldt, his brother William,
Mrs. Hemans, Lady Mary Wortley
Montague, and two or three others
whose names I have forgotten, assisted
me, not only in writing the work prepared 
at Riverside, but they are still
with me when I attempt to get clearer,
purer views of the finer forces of the
sex. I received the communication
with the names given through Dr. J.
V. Mansfield, and signed by Von Humboldt. 
Permission was given to use
the names in connection with the
work, but the letter being lost in my
attempt to send it to Dr. J. Rodes Buchanan 
for psychometrization, I have
never before given the name to the
public. This second pamphlet is put
first in the book.</p>

<p>"A Sex Revolution" was written in
1862. It puts motherhood to the front,
demands that "women take the lead"
till the conditions for a higher grade of
motherhood are obtained.</p>

<p>Another work issued recently is the
"Fountain of Life, or the Threefold
Power of Sex."</p>

<p>I have also essayed the newspaper
business or method of scattering
thought. "Our Age, Ours&mdash;the Peoples'," 
was issued at Battle Creek,
Michigan, till forty-two numbers were
sent out. Then the financial crisis of
1873-4 forced a suspension.</p>

<p>"Foundation Principles," issued from
Clinton, Ia., in 1884, and afterwards removed 
to Antioch, California, was carried 
into the fourth volume, when it
suspended for a time, but was finally
resumed after I had located in Topeka,
Kansas.</p>

<p>I do not know what the future of
this life has for me, but this I do know&mdash;that 
I shall never consider my work

<!-- page 175 col 1 -->

done so long as I have the strength to
do, and the privilege of doing more&mdash;and&mdash;</p>

<p>Whenever I'm called, I gladly will go,<br/>

My lessons of wisdom to learn over
there;<br/>

Then back I will hasten, to help lift
this earth<br/>

Out of its ignorance, sorrow and care&mdash;<br/>

Will aid it to cast off its sorrow and
care,<br/>

For I could not remain in a world filled
with bliss<br/>

<!-- page 175 col 2 -->

While rivers of sorrow were rolling
thro' this.</p>

<p class="right">Yours, for the Work,<br/>

LOIS WAISBROOKER.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;I have forgotten one thing.
So many will ask: Was she ever married? 
I have been twice married, have
two children and six grandchildren,
but I have lived so long alone, and
there is so much questioning if marriage 
be not a failure, that married or
single scarcely ever enters my thought.</p>
