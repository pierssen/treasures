<h2>ALICE VALE.</h2>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="small">CHILDHOOD.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">Leave not the vine to stand erect,<br/>

Nor train the oak to crawl.</p>

<p>"WHAT a strange child!"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Who? why Alice Vale, to be sure: I
never saw another like her."</p>

<p>"What made you think of her now?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't you see her over the way there, talking
with Crazy Pete? Other children, large and small, are
afraid of him: even my Helen, though two years older
than Alice, will cross the street to avoid meeting him."</p>

<p>"Is he dangerous, or troublesome?"</p>

<p>"Not as I have ever heard; but, somehow, he has a
way of making the younger portion of the community
avoid him,&mdash;all except Alice; and she seems to understand
him as well as though she had had charge of an
insane asylum for a score of years."</p>

<p>"Better, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Better! why do you say that?"</p>

<!-- page 10 -->

<p>"Because some persons know instinctively what it
takes others a lifetime to learn."</p>

<p>"I thought that instinct belonged to the animal kingdom
only."</p>

<p>"Intuitively would have been a better word."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't see the difference; and this acting
without thought never ends in any good: if she was a
child of mine, I'd teach her better than to be wandering
around with a crazy vagabond like Pete Stiverton.
It can do her no good, if it does not result in positive
injury: people are more or less affected by the company
they keep; and I shouldn't wonder if Alice went crazy
herself yet."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"Oh! a great many things. She is always doing or
saying some out-of-the-way, unheard-of thing. Crazy
people, you know, are remarkable for sharp, cunning
speeches; and I never saw her equal at that. What do
you suppose she said about Uncle Edward the other
day?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I can not imagine."</p>

<p>"Uncle, as you know, lives with us, and has from the
time he lost his wife. He has had trouble in the past,
it is true, but nothing that need to affect him particularly
now: still, at times, he becomes very despondent,
so much so that it makes it really unpleasant for all
about him. I was speaking of this at Mrs. Vale's one
day last week, when Alice looked up and said, 'All he
needs, Mrs. Roland, is a good tonic'</p>

<p>" 'A tonic?' I asked in surprise; 'what do you
mean? he is not sick.'</p>

<p>" 'Not in body,' she replied; 'but life is moving too

<!-- page 11 -->

easy with him: he has so much of the sweet that it
sickens him, and he has to look back to the old times
for something bitter; now, if he had some real present
trouble, it would so stir him up that he would forget all
about the blues.'</p>

<p>"I looked at the girl in perfect astonishment, while
she continued, 'I know that it is so; for there is old
Mrs. Frost, who has been mourning and complaining all
summer: one could not be in her company ten minutes
but she would commence talking about the loss of
her husband and property, and of her hard lot in life;
but she is happy enough now. I saw her this morning,
and she looked so cheerful that it was like sunshine; and
all because her Mary, who has been sick, is getting better.'</p>

<p>" 'And is not that enough to make her glad?' I
asked.</p>

<p>" 'Ought she not to have been just as glad that
Mary was well before she was sick at all?' was her
quick response. 'No, no: she needed the bitter, she
needed the tonic, that's all.'</p>

<p>"Now, what do you think of a child of fifteen making
such a speech as that?"</p>

<p>"I think she has heard some older person make the
remark, or something like it, and, treasuring the idea,
has expressed it in her own language."</p>

<p>"No: her mother says that she is always making just
such speeches."</p>

<p>"Yes; and mothers are very apt to think their children
especially smart."</p>

<p>"But not so Mrs. Vale: she looks upon it as a fault,
and chides Alice severely for being so 'forward and
saucy,' to use her own words."</p>

<!-- page 12 -->

<p>"Do you say that Alice is fifteen?"</p>

<p>"Yes: she is two months older than my Freddy; but
she acts so much like a child, notwithstanding her smart
speeches, that one would never suppose her to be that
old: and such a romp! Only last week, as I was passing
there, Mrs. Vale came to the door and called for Alice;
and where do you think she was? up in the very top
of the largest cherry-tree, sitting there as contentedly
as if she were a bird, and her home a tree.</p>

<p>" 'Why, Alice!' exclaimed Mrs. Vale, 'how came
you up there?'</p>

<p>" 'O mother! the cherries are getting ripe. I found
half a dozen, up here, where they have a fair chance to
the sun, that were real good: then I got to watching a
bird in the next tree, looking at the clouds, and listening
to the bees, till I forgot all about my work; but I
will come right down now, and do whatever you wish
me to.'</p>

<p>" 'I wish more than any thing else,' replied her
mother, 'that you would quit acting so much like a
boy, and learn to be a woman.'</p>

<p>" 'But I am not a woman yet, mother: when I am,
I will act like one.'</p>

<p>" 'Neither are you a boy,' said Mrs. Vale;  'but you
certainly act like one, romping and climbing half the
time.'</p>

<p>" 'Mother,' said Alice, 'did God make the sunshine,
birds, nuts, bees, squirrels, and all the wonderful things
that I find in the fields and woods, only for the boys?'</p>

<p>" 'Certainly not: what a question!'</p>

<p>" 'I should think he did by the way people talk
when girls try to enjoy them in their own way.'</p>

<!-- page 13 -->

<p>" 'O Alice, Alice! what will ever become of you?
You are such a strange child!' said Mrs. Vale, as she
disappeared within the house; and I thought as much.
I tell you, Mrs. Manning, I'd break her of some of her
hoydenish ways if I had her to deal with."</p>

<p>Such, in substance, was the conversation held between
two neighbors of the little village of Ellsville, in the
old Empire State, one pleasant summer morning some
twenty years ago. Mrs. Roland was a leader among the
fashionables; and Mrs. Manning the wife of the wealthiest
man in the place, and, though making no pretensions,
was rather looked up to on that account. And now
of Alice Vale and "Crazy Pete," or Peter Stiverton:
who and what were they?</p>

<p>Of Alice and her disposition we have already learned
something. Her parents, like thousands of others, had
once figured in the mercantile world of a great city,
failed, and, having removed to this little village, were
trying life on a more humble scale. Mrs. Vale, a quiet,
dreamy sort of a woman, had never been a favorite in
the world of fashion, in which she might have moved
when wealth was theirs, had she so chosen; but here
she had the good sense to perceive, that, if she retired
into herself the same as formerly, it would be mistaken
by those among whom her lot was now cast as <i>city
pride</i>. She therefore strove to make herself as agreeable
as possible, and so far succeeded as to be well liked
by the villagers.</p>

<p>The family, when they came to the place, consisted of
Mr. and Mrs. Vale and three children,&mdash;Alice and two
sons,&mdash;one older and the other younger than she was.
The youngest one was drowned in a neighboring pond

<!-- page 14 -->

soon after they came there; and the elder one had left
home in a fit of anger, some eighteen months previous,
and had not been heard of since; that is, not directly,
though the ship in which he was supposed to have
sailed had been reported lost, and he was mourned by
his friends as dead. Thus at the time our story commences
there was only Alice left: consequently the
affections of her parents naturally centered in her,
making them very anxious that she should do and be
all that their fond hearts could desire.</p>

<p>Alice, wild, wayward, thoughtless,&mdash;so the mother
believed; but, could she have read the thoughts that
welled up in her child's heart, she would have formed
quite a different opinion. As she could not do this, she
judged from the external, and from the opinions of
those about her, and grieved in her soul lest this, her
only remaining one, should not be all that she could
wish.</p>

<p>"Was she a bad child?" you ask.</p>

<p>No: not <i>bad</i>; but she cared for none of those things
that interested other girls of her age. It mattered not
to her whether her clothes were in fashion, or no. If
she was invited to parties, picnics, and the like, all
right: still, she seldom attended them; and, if not
invited, she never noticed the omission.</p>

<p>She would make the strangest, wisest speeches, and
then romp with her kitten, or play with her doll, with
as much earnestness and zest of enjoyment as though
she had been but six instead of fifteen years of age; and
no amount of persuasion, argument, or ridicule, could
tempt her to throw aside her childish pleasures.</p>

<p>"She didn't feel like a young lady," she said, "and

<!-- page 15 -->

she didn't want to be one: if she tried, she would only
make a fool of herself; and she just wished they would
let her alone." The only one whose company she
really seemed to care for was "Crazy Pete," as he was
called; and, when rallied upon her preference, she would
stoutly maintain that he was not crazy,&mdash;that he knew
more than others, and that was why they called him so.</p>

<p>She would wander with him through the fields,
woods, and by the creek-side for hours, when permitted
to do so, and never seemed happier than when by his
side, listening to his quaint remarks about the shells,
pebbles, and flowers that were found in their path.
Once her parents forbade her going where he was, or
having any thing to say to him if she chanced to meet
him; but she cried herself sick, and they were obliged
to remove the prohibition. And now who was Crazy
Pete?</p>

<p>Pause, kind reader, and, as you hear the reply, wonder
not that Alice Vale was a grief to her parents,
ignored by her companions, and treated to a general
shake of the head by the community at large. Crazy
Pete was a pauper, and the son of a poor woman who
had come into the neighborhood about the time of his
birth, and of whom nothing was known further than "<i>it
was supposed</i> that she had never been married."</p>

<p>This of itself was enough to condemn him to infamy:
but, when you added to this the fact that he was counted
insane, surely a girl of fifteen who could prefer his
society to that of all others gave her parents cause for
sorrow; and a watchful community did well to shake
the head, and wonder what would be the result.</p>

<p>O vainly wise world! how little thou knowest of the

<!-- page 16 -->

secret springs of action, of the wisdom that prepares
its instruments for the accomplishment of the progressive
changes that must come to the race in answer to
its own prayers and aspirations!</p>

<p>O foolishly judging world! noting effects instead of
causes. One in ancient times truly said, that "the
wisdom of this world is foolishness with God;" and it
is equally true that the wisdom of God is foolishness
with the world.</p>

<p>But let us look into the nature of Peter Stiverton's
insanity, if, indeed, it was such; let us trace some of its
causes: but, to do this, we must go back somewhere near
another score of years,&mdash;must go back to the mother
who bore him, to the father whose villainy broke her
heart, checked its warm life-currents, and sent her to
the angel world for consolation, for sympathetic healing
from earth's cruel wrongs.</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="small">THE WOLF AND THE LAMB.</p>

</div>

<p>LOVELY Marion, darling Marion Sloan,
though dwelling in the vale of poverty,
she possessed the qualities that won love
from all who knew her. All her life long
she had lived in the little cottage which
stood at the foot of one of the grandest of the Green
Mountains; all her life had she been familiar with its
rugged paths, its deep gorges, and its sunny nooks; had
watched the birds from year to year as they built their
nests in the little grove at the right of their humble
dwelling; had listened summer after summer to the
music of the rippling brook, and had long since learned
where the choicest grapes were to be found. But, most
of all, she loved to sit at evening in the cottage-door,
and, looking across the corner of a ledge of rock, catch
a glimpse of the church-spire in the village beyond, just
as the sun was flinging his last backward glance upon
the valley. In such an hour as this, she fancied that
she could almost see the angels of God ascending and
descending thereon, even as they did upon Jacob's ladder
in olden time.</p>

<p>She was the child of many prayers, and the last of
seven, the others sleeping in the quiet resting-place for
the dead that lay just behind their humble place of worship;
and for two years the mother had lain beside them.

<!-- page 18 -->

Yes: she was a child of many prayers, and a prayerful
child, or woman, as we must now call her; for eighteen
summers had shed their light upon her brown hair, and
given the hue of health to her rounded cheek.</p>

<p>Earnestly&mdash;oh, how earnestly!&mdash;had her parents
plead with Father God that he would spare them this,
their last remaining one, and make her a blessing to their
old age,&mdash;would spare her, and make her his own by a
life that should manifest his glory, instead of taking her
to himself in childhood, as he had the others.</p>

<p>She was spared; and the aroma of piety surrounded
her as naturally as fragrance emanates from the rose:
while each rock, bird, and bee, and indeed all with
which she came in contact, awoke emotions of reverence,
and sent the incense of devotion upward from the
pure altar of her heart. The mother died blessing God
for this, to her, visible answer to her prayers; and the
father continued the paean of praise as he watched the
outgoings and incomings of his child from day to day.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"Morn amid the mountains,<br/>

Lovely solitude,<br/>

Gushing streams and fountains,<br/>

Murmur, God is good."</p>

</div>

<p>And the heart of the aged man echoed, "God is good;"
but could he have truly realized that,&mdash;</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Every thrill of anguish,<br/>

Could we see the why,<br/>

Utters the same language<br/>

To the earth and sky;<br/>

Every pang of sorrow<br/>

Rightly understood,<br/>

Every bitter trial,<br/>

Murmurs, "God is good."</p>

</div>

<!-- page 19 -->

<p>he would not have died broken hearted in the dark
days that followed.</p>

<p>Marion Sloan was not only beloved by all, but she
was looked upon as peculiarly favored of the Lord; for
at the time she had united with the church, some six
months before her mother's death, she had fallen into a
sort of trance, and lay for hours in a state that many
supposed to be death. Even her father had given her
up, and, but for his wife, would have permitted preparations
for her funeral to have been made; but the mother
still insisted that Marion was not dead. Just at this
juncture, she came back to consciousness, and said that
she had been to heaven,&mdash;had seen her brothers and
sisters there, and others that she had known when they
were here.</p>

<p>"How do you know that they were your brothers and
sisters, as you never knew them while here?" asked the
minister.</p>

<p>"They told me they were," she quietly replied; "and,
if they had not, I should have known it, for I could read
their very thoughts." Those who stood around looked
at one another in silence, while Deacon Smith murmured,</p>

<p>"The very intents and purposes of the heart shall be
made known."</p>

<p>"But did you see Jesus?" asked her mother.</p>

<p>"That is right, sister," said the deacon: "it shows
that your heart is in the right place, for there can be no
heaven without Jesus." But Marion only smiled, and
said, "I must not, or, rather, I can not, tell all I saw;
for I have not the language to express it, and, beside,
they told me that I must not try."</p>

<p>From this time forth, she used frequently to speak of

<!-- page 20 -->

seeing different ones who were dead, as the world calls
dead. A few shook their heads, and touched their foreheads;
but by most of the people she was looked upon as
one peculiarly favored of Heaven. It was not to be
wondered at, they asserted; for, like Samuel of old, she
had been devoted to God from her birth, and her whole
life had been but a fulfillment of the vows made for her
at the baptismal font.</p>

<p>After her mother's death, Marion would sometimes
tell of seeing her; but latterly she had not seen her
mother nor any one else, or else had become very reticent
upon the subject, for she had spoken of nothing of
the kind for some months. Mrs. Sloan had been an
invalid for some time previous to her death; and her
sickness had involved them in considerable expense, while
the old gentleman's rheumatism rendered him unable to
earn very much. This, with other things, had made
them poor, and kept them so; but they retained their
cow, had their garden, and, with Marion's help, raised a
few potatoes, and corn enough to fatten a pig. This, with
odd jobs that Marion did for a neighbor's wife, and a
little cobbling by her father for the neighbors' boys,
served to keep them quite comfortable.</p>

<p>But crops sometimes fail, as we all know; and this
was the case in the summer of &mdash;&mdash;, in the region of
country where the Sloans dwelt. Late frosts had destroyed
much of the promise of spring; the summer
months had been so unusually wet that things could not
grow; while autumn set in dry and cold, so that altogether
the prospect for the coming winter was any thing
but inviting, even to the better class of farmers, to say
nothing of the poor. It was just at this juncture that

<!-- page 21 -->

a stranger called at the Sloan cottage one pleasant afternoon,
and asked for a glass of water, and the privilege of
resting for a few moments.</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly," said the old gentleman. "Marion,
go and bring some fresh from the spring; or, sir,
would you not prefer a glass of milk?"</p>

<p>"That would indeed be a treat," was the reply; and
accordingly the milk was brought, while the gentleman
cast upon the fair girl a look of such undisguised admiration,
that she shrank away, and left her father to entertain
him. And, more than this, she felt an aversion toward
him at first sight, that surprised even herself, the
emotion was so new and strange. Thitherto the feelings
of her heart had flowed out toward all in love and
kindness; and why should she thus shrink from this
stranger?</p>

<p>"Surely, it was wrong,&mdash;a temptation from the evil
one; for did not God command us to be kind to the
stranger within the gate? yes, it was wrong, and she
would banish it from her heart."</p>

<p>It was thus that she reasoned; but, instead of returning
to the house, she went still farther away to a secluded
spot among the rocks, where, humbly kneeling,
she strove to plead with the good Father in heaven for
assistance. Alas for short-sighted mortals! refusing to
accept nature's true method, the warning voice within,
and at the same time calling to something without and
beyond them for aid. God no more certainly spake to
Moses in the burning-bush than he did to the heart of
this poor maiden, had she only heard and heeded; but
she mistook it for the voice of an enemy, and so turned
away from listening.</p>

<!-- page 22 -->

<p>"Why should she feel thus toward this stranger?"
thus she still questioned,&mdash;questioned instead of praying;
for when she had reached her chosen place of retirement,
and, kneeling, strove to pray, she could find no
words in which to prefer petition, but could only question
and wonder.</p>

<p>"Why should she feel thus toward this stranger? he
was young, fine looking, pleasant and genial in his manners,
well calculated in every way to win instead of
repelling. It was all wrong, she was sure it was; and
how could she approach God while shrinking from her
duty? Of course she could not: she would go back to
the house, and help her father to entertain their temporary
guest."</p>

<p>The traveler, in the mean time, found one pretext
after another to continue the conversation, hoping thereby
to gain another glimpse of the fair vision that had
greeted him at his entrance.</p>

<p>Finally, as he arose to go, he asked Mr. Sloan if he
could direct him to a good, quiet boarding-place. "I
am here," said he, "for health and recreation. I am
traveling under the patronage of a friend, who furnishes
the means upon condition that I bring back some sketches
of the finest views that I can obtain of your grand
old mountains; and I have seen none as yet equal to the
one here from your door."</p>

<p>"I do not know, my young friend, just what you
want, or whether, with your city habits, you could be
suited with our plain people and their common fare.
We have been having hard times up here, and the prospect
ahead is no better," said the old gentleman, with a
sigh; "but if you could be comfortable anywhere in the

<!-- page 23 -->

place, it would be at the Widow Brown's, in the stone
house beyond the church."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir," said the gentleman, "if you think I
should be hard to please, you are mistaken. I lived in
the country myself the earlier portion of my life: my
father owned a small, rocky farm, and we had to work
hard to earn a livelihood. When I was about fifteen, an
uncle left me a small sum of money; and then, with my
father's consent, I went to the city in order to gratify
the desire that I had always felt,&mdash;that of becoming an
artist; but my means are so limited, that I should not
have dared to indulge myself in this trip, though needing
the recreation, but for the kindness of the friend
aforesaid. But why not let me stop with you? You
seem to have but a small family, and it would be so
quiet: I am sure I should like nothing better.</p>

<p>"I hardly think it possible; but I will talk with my
daughter about it. Marion, Marion, where are you?"
he called; and, receiving no reply, exclaimed, "Why,
where has the child gone! I never knew her to do the
like; but you must pardon her, sir, for this seeming lack
of courtesy, as she is not much accustomed to seeing
strangers, and is somewhat timid."</p>

<p>"No offense," replied the gentleman, smiling inwardly
at the deference paid him by the simple-hearted old
man,&mdash;"no offense, sir. I will go to the village and make
a few inquiries, ascertain if there are any letters for me
in the office, and then return for your answer. That
will give you time to talk with your daughter without
the embarrassment of my presence: you have a public
house in the village, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and a good one for these parts."</p>

<!-- page 24 -->

<p>"Good-evening, then, for the present;" and, taking
up his portfolio, he walked briskly in the direction indicated.
The old man watched his retreating form till it
was lost beyond the point of rocks before spoken of; and
then, as he turned to take his accustomed seat, Marion
came in from the back way.</p>

<p>"Where have you been, child?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Just up the mountain a little way: has the gentleman
gone?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but he is coming back again: what do you
suppose he wants, Marion?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I can not tell, father."</p>

<p>"Well, he thinks of stopping a while in the place, and
wants to board here."</p>

<p>"O father!" she exclaimed, as a shiver ran through
her frame: "you did not tell him that he might come?"</p>

<p>"No: I told him that I would talk with you first; but
why not take him? We have the spare room that he
could occupy: you are a good cook; and I see nothing
to prevent."</p>

<p>"O father! I don't know why; but I feel as if he
must not come,&mdash;as if there was something wrong."</p>

<p>"Judge not, that ye be not judged," said the old
man solemnly.</p>

<p>"I know it, father; and 'Be kind to the stranger that
is within thy gate,' is another of the commands of that
holy book. And yet I do not feel kindly toward this
stranger,&mdash;did not from the first: I can not tell why
it is."</p>

<p>"A temptation of Satan, my child: you are young,
as yet, in the Christian race; and he would try you.
Pray God that your faith fail not."</p>

<!-- page 25 -->

<p>"Indeed, father, I feared it was thus; and I have been
out to study and pray over it: but the feeling does not
leave me. O father! perhaps it is a warning; for I
never felt so toward human being before."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said the old man thoughtfully. Marion's
eye brightened. "Then we surely ought to heed it," she
said. But the scanty crops and the wants of the coming
winter rose before the father's vision; and he replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, no: it can not be that; for it was only to-day
that I was wondering where our winter supplies were
coming from. Let us rather think, my daughter, that
the Lord has sent him to rebuke my want of faith; in
that case, if we do not accept what is thus put into our
hands, what warrant have we of his further care?"</p>

<p>"I had not thought of it in that light," said Marion
sadly. "You have had more experience than I have, and
are more likely to be in the right. I will try to overcome
these feelings; and, if you think it best to have him
stop with us a while, will do what I can to make things
pleasant for him."</p>

<p>"But I do not wish to do any thing that will make
you unhappy, my child."</p>

<p>"Never mind me, father: you have always told me
that true happiness could be found only in doing one's
duty faithfully. I shall be happy enough if I feel that
I am doing right." And so the matter was settled in
favor of the stranger's remaining.</p>

<p>Something over an hour after the above conversation,
the young man returned from the village to learn
the result of his application.</p>

<p>"Has your daughter not returned yet?" he asked,
glancing around the room, and not seeing Marion.</p>

<!-- page 26 -->

<p>"Oh, yes! she came in just after you left: she is not
far away," was the reply.</p>

<p>"And what have I to hope from her decision, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sloan is my name," said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"And mine is Munson,&mdash;Philip Munson."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Munson, we have decided, that, if you
can put up with our poor accommodations, you can stop
with us for a while."</p>

<p>"Thanks, thanks," said the young man with an
alacrity that showed he was truly pleased; and again his
eye went in search of Marion.</p>

<p>She, poor girl, must have felt his approach; for she
certainly could not have seen him. Just before he
came around the ledge of rocks that hid the village from
them, she felt the same shudder running through her
frame that she had experienced before; and, quickly
leaving the house, she found herself some rods up the
mountain before she thought what she was doing. "This
will never do," she said, as she came to herself,&mdash;"this
will never do;" and, retracing her steps, she entered the
cottage just after the stranger had sent his second glance
in search of her.</p>

<p>"Mr. Munson, my daughter," said Mr. Sloan, as she
came in; "finding that he is to stop with us a while, he
has favored us with his name."</p>

<p>The young man bowed low; while she, in as cheerful
tones as she could command, bade him "good evening."</p>

<p>"And a very beautiful evening it is," he was about
to add; but something in her look checked him, and he
remained silent.</p>

<p>Marion passed a restless night, and looked so sad the

<!-- page 27 -->

next morning, and that in spite of her too evident attempts
to appear cheerful, that her father was troubled
by it. "My child," said he, as soon as he had the opportunity
of speaking with her alone, "is the presence
of this stranger really making you unhappy?"</p>

<p>"O father!" she replied, bursting into tears, "I
can not help it: indeed I can not. I try to think it all
right; but the feeling that it is so will not come. I
wish that we had not consented to take him. I saw
mother last night, and she looked so sorrowful."</p>

<p>"Saw your mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes: as plainly as I ever saw her in life."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut: you make too much of these visions of
yours, as you call them. You make too much account
of them: they will lead you astray yet. You were
dreaming, and thought you saw her."</p>

<p>"No, father: I was as wide awake as ever I was."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt that you think so: but the idea that
your mother should leave her home in glory, and come
here to be saddened by the affairs of this life, is simply
preposterous: and not only that, but wicked; for where
would be the rest promised to the people of God if
this were the case?"</p>

<p>"Alas! I know not, dear father: it is all a mystery to
me; but I know what I see," she replied sadly, as she
turned to her accustomed duties.</p>

<p>The morning passed quickly. Mr. Munson spent it
in looking about the valley, and in ascending the mountain
some distance at several points, to find, as he said,
the best views, intending to sketch them at his leisure.</p>

<p>He talked of this with the old gentleman while at
dinner, scarcely addressing a remark to Marion till the

<!-- page 28 -->

meal was nearly finished, when, turning to her, he
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Miss Sloan, you would favor me by pointing
out some of the places from whence choice views
can be had? I am sure I am not mistaken in believing
that you have an eye for the beautiful."</p>

<p>"The view that pleases me best is from our west
window," said she quietly; "and that just as the sun
flings his last glance upon the village-steeple."</p>

<p>"And will you be so kind as to show to me the exact
position in which the best effect can be obtained?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"I will," she replied in a tone which showed that
she shrank from further conversation; and, dinner over,
the gentleman retired to his room. Taking a privilege
that he would hardly have been willing to grant, we
will follow him thither; for, by so doing, we, perhaps,
may ascertain if there is really any foundation for
Marion's dislike.</p>

<p>See! he has taken pen, ink, and paper, and seems to
be writing a letter. We will peep over his shoulder, and
learn for ourselves:</p>

<p class="small">EATON, Sept. 9.</p>

<p>Hail, friend and fellow-craftsman of the Lodge of
Loyal Brothers to the idea of doing as you please!</p>

<p>A long prefix, Mark; but I think it expresses your
character and mine, to say the least. True, there are
many things in the way,&mdash;much that tends to prevent
our living out the full spirit of our creed; but we must
expect to be tried. It is only the brave and persistent
ones that win in a race like this; and, if we meet with
opposition, we must learn to be as wise as serpents, and

<!-- page 29 -->

as harmless as&mdash;as&mdash;d&mdash;&mdash;ls. I would write the whole
word, but it would not look well on paper; and you
well know that looks go a great way toward success.
As you are pretty good at deciphering abreviations,
I think that you can make out my meaning without much
trouble.</p>

<p>"But where is Eaton?" I hear you ask.</p>

<p>Here, right here, my good brother, in the shadow
of one of the tallest of the Green Mountains; and close
to the village is a rural retreat, where a rheumatic old
man resides with his pretty daughter; and snugly esconsced
in that retreat is your humble servant. Zounds!
could I have carried out my principles, I should, ere
this, have given this mountain-nymph some strong proofs
of my affection for her lovely self. I shall do it some
day. Mind, I say <i>I shall;</i> and you know me well
enough to have learned that I have stricken the word
fail from my vocabulary.</p>

<p>She evidently dislikes me, but I care not for that:
the harder the task, the more glorious the success. I
shall have to play shy, however,&mdash;shy, pious, and all of
that, which you know I can do to perfection.</p>

<p>But enough of this till I can report further progress.
They believe me to be a poor artist, depending upon the
money that a rich friend pays me for my sketches. Ha,
ha, ha! isn't that rich? Don't let any one know where
I am till the excitement about that last little affair blows
over; and don't write till you hear from me again.</p>

<p>Yours, &amp;c., PHILIP.</p>

<p>And thus we learn what manner of man it was that
had found a place in the home of the Sloans. With

<!-- page 30 -->

the revealings and demonstrations of modern Spiritualism
to aid us, we can readily see why it was that Marion
shrank from his presence, and why the spirit-mother
looked sad. We can see also to what power Munson
trusted for success,&mdash;the power of a strong will, acting
upon a susceptible organization, or, as we say, psychologically.
He probably knew it not by that name; but he
knew its power.</p>

<p>Had Marion and her father known what we know,
they would have heeded the warning given; but, lacking
this, they passed on and suffered.</p>

<p>For the first two or three weeks Munson said but
little to Marion, further than common politeness required,
unless occasion offered to ask a favor, as in the
case of the best view. Whenever this occurred, he
was sure to avail himself of it; but he sometimes fixed
upon her a sad, reproachful look, as if conscious of her
aversion, and deprecating its existence.</p>

<p>This could not fail to have its effect upon a nature
like her's,&mdash;a nature that would not knowingly wrong
the least of God's creatures; and, accusing herself of
injustice, she would strive to make amends by pleasant
smiles, and redoubled attention to his wants. Under the
influence of efforts like these, her aversion gradually
wore away, till she came, at length, to wonder that she
had ever felt any.</p>

<p>In the mean time, this wolf in sheep's clothing was
not idle. Steadily he toiled toward the accomplishment
of his purpose; storming the outposts, and working
his way gradually toward the citadel. He talked
theology to Mr. Sloan, agreeing with him on just the
points that would please the old man most; listened

<!-- page 31 -->

deferentially to the minister, and made the deacons believe
that he was almost persuaded to study for the
ministry himself, only the sacredness of the office, and
a sense of his own unworthiness, prevented.</p>

<p>But why follow the serpentine windings of this human
fiend?&mdash;fiend through the false teachings, and consequent
false customs, of society,&mdash;why follow him step
by step as he nears his victim? We will not attempt
further to portray the hellish arts by means of which he
triumphed; for our soul sickens at the recital. Suffice
it to say, that he made good his boast, and left the roof
that had sheltered him with its most treasured inmate
betrayed, ruined so far as this life was concerned.</p>

<p>True, she believed herself wedded to him,&mdash;that in
three months at most, perhaps in as many weeks, he
would return and acknowledge her before the world.
This he had solemnly pledged himself to do; for, with all
his boasted power over woman, he dared not even make
the attempt to lead her other than through Hymen's
pathway.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>But the torch, it was a false one,<br/>

Held by hands as basely false:<br/>

Power assumed by one who had none,&mdash;<br/>

Priestly robe and saintly face.</p>

</div>

<p>Yet even here he had so covered his tracks, that she
could not show this much to be true,&mdash;not a trace to
serve in the eyes of her friends as a palliation for her
condition.</p>

<p>When Philip Munson left the village of Eaton, he
had played the hypocrite so successfully, that he carried
with him the hearts of both young and old; and Marion,
as she listened to his praises, was for a time happy. But

<!-- page 32 -->

gradually the psychological glamor that had been thrown
around her began to fade; her old aversion came back,
and with it the most terrible doubts. She continued
to hope, however, till the extreme limit of the time set
for his return had passed: then doubt gave place to a
feeling akin to despair.</p>

<p>And how fared it with this poor lamb in the church
of which she was so loved a member? Did they stand
by her in pitying sympathy in this the hour of her
sorest need? Far from it. <i>The sheep that went not
astray</i> met in solemn conclave, and expelled her from
their fold. Even the father who had argued so strongly
against the aversion she had felt toward the stranger as
to gain her consent that he should become an inmate
of their home,&mdash;even he said that there was no excuse
for her sin, and, cursing her for dishonoring his gray
hairs, took to his bed a broken-hearted man, leaving it
only for the grave.</p>

<p>Left alone with her mighty sorrow, Marion's only
consolation was in those visions that had once been
looked upon as evidence of God's favor, but were now
considered proof of insanity by some, and of willful deception
by others. She thinks thus to gain sympathy,
they said; but she has shown herself too vile, too desperately
wicked, to be trusted at all. And thus the
pressure became stronger and stronger.</p>

<p>Helpless and despised, left a pauper to be cared for
in her approaching hour of trial by those who would
have no sympathy for her whatever,&mdash;the places where
she had wandered with her betrayer, the scenes that
she had looked upon from childhood, and the faces she
had always known, becoming hateful to her, the poor

<!-- page 33 -->

girl could bear it no longer. Reason at last really
gave way, while the idea of escaping from all she had
ever known took full possession of her mind. With a
maniac's cunning, she laid her plans, and carried them
out so effectually that the people of Eaton never knew
what became of her. Yea, even some of those who
had once been loudest in commendation, going to the
opposite extreme, said that the devil had helped her
away.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the little village in which our story
opens was startled one July morning with the report
that a young and beautiful woman had been found on
Deacon Smith's doorstep in a condition that demanded
immediate assistance.</p>

<p>Who was she? and from whence did she come? were
the questions that flew from lip to lip: but no one could
answer them, for none knew; and all that they ever
learned of her was what transpired in the few days that
she lived after she came among them. They saw that
her mind was unsettled; but whether it had been caused
by trouble, or otherwise, they could not tell. She said
but little: and from that little they could learn neither
her name, nor place of residence; and dying, of course
her body was left a heritage to the town.</p>

<p>I said they learned nothing from what she said,&mdash;nothing
but her father's first name; for she had said of
her child, "Call him Peter, after my father."</p>

<p>Such were the antecedents of Crazy Pete,&mdash;such the
causes that made him what he was. Inheriting his
mother's susceptibility, or, as we should say, mediumistic
powers, intensified, he manifested them from
early childhood, saw what those about him could not

<!-- page 34 -->

see, heard that of which their ears could catch no note;
and so they called him crazy.</p>

<p>Though perfectly harmless, his talk of seeing angels,
his mother, and others who were known to be dead, made
him an object of fear and awe to the younger portion of
the community, and of contempt to the others. Is it
strange, then, that it should call forth remark, when,
instead of shrinking away, as others of her years did,
Alice Vale would spend hours in his company, asserting,
when spoken to upon the subject, that he was no
more crazy than other folks?</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="small">THE PROPHECY.</p>

</div>

<p>ELIZA COOK wrote a poem called
"The Teachings of the Idiot-born;" and
another writer, in speaking of her poems,
says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"Thine idiot-born, O God of love!<br/>

How little do we know,<br/>

Who, in that world to come, shall prove<br/>

The high ones, or the low!<br/>

Then let us never dare to scorn<br/>

The teachings of the idiot-born."</p>

</div>

<p>Peter Stiverton,&mdash;he took his last name from those
who cared for him the first years of his life,&mdash;Peter
Stiverton was a pauper, and, as such, would not, of
course, be judged by the same rule that more favored
children are. He was always peculiar; but what would
have been considered as evidence of smartness in others
was counted as a tendency to insanity in him, and more
especially as his mother's mind had evidently been unsettled.
He was about twelve years of age when his
peculiarities began to increase upon him; and, by the
time he was fourteen, it was a conceded fact in the
minds of the people generally, that he was really crazy:
and they would as soon have thought of heeding the

<!-- page 36 -->

teachings of the "idiot-born," as to have paid any particular
attention to aught that he told them; but, to
Alice, there was a meaning in all his strange sayings.</p>

<p>"Peter, why do you look so sad?" said she to him
one day, as she found him in his accustomed seat beneath
the broad spreading elm, alone in the grove below
the old mill.</p>

<p>"Because I have been doing wrong, Miss Alice."</p>

<p>"Why do you always say Miss? I am not Miss, but
only Alice."</p>

<p>"You are Miss Alice; and I shall always call you so."</p>

<p>"Then I will call you Mr. Peter. But what have
you been doing wrong?"</p>

<p>"I have been angry,&mdash;oh! so angry; and it makes
me unhappy to think of it."</p>

<p>"What was it that made you angry, Mr. Peter?"</p>

<p>"That big boy who has lately come into the place
called me a pauper, and my mother a bad woman."</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't mind it, Peter."</p>

<p>"I don't now, Miss Alice: I am only sorry that I
was so wicked as to get angry; of all the people in the
world, Peter Stiverton should have known better."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I have been taught by the angels," he replied
solemnly.</p>

<p>Alice looked at him with wondering, earnest eyes;
and there was an expression in them which showed that
she, too, would like to be taught by the angels.</p>

<p>After a moment's silence, as if in answer to her
thoughts, he continued, "Wait, wait; it will come at
last."</p>

<p>"What will come?" she said.</p>

<!-- page 37 -->

<p>"I can not tell you what, for they have not told me;
but they say it will come." And, as if he could not
forget that he had been angry, he murmured, "Oh! it
was so wrong: the birds and the bees tell me of it; the
flies laugh at me; and even the mosquitoes sing, 'You
got mad, Peter. Peter, you got mad.' "</p>

<p>"Fie, fie, Peter! that is all nonsense: you only imagine
it."</p>

<p>Turning his blue eyes full upon her, he waited at
least a minute without speaking. Alice began to fear
that she had grieved him, when he asked, "Do you not
believe that all things have a language?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I do, Peter."</p>

<p>"What is the use of a language that is not understood?"</p>

<p>"They may understand each other,&mdash;doubtless do,
Peter."</p>

<p>"The trees and the flowers?"</p>

<p>"I never thought of it before; but, if they have a
language, they must, of course."</p>

<p>"And does not God understand them all?"</p>

<p>"God knows all things, Peter."</p>

<p>"And can give to his creatures such gifts as he
chooses?"</p>

<p>"No one doubts his power," said Alice.</p>

<p>"Why, then, could he not give me ears to hear what
the bees and the birds, the flies and the mosquitoes,
say?"</p>

<p>"It must be so, Peter: I feel that you are right; and
yet it seems so strange. I never look upon a beautiful
flower, or a grand old tree, but they seem to be talking
to me: only I can not understand what they say."</p>

<!-- page 38 -->

<p>"Neither can I understand what the French people
say who come here sometimes."</p>

<p>"Oh! but you could learn if you had a teacher."</p>

<p>"Do you not believe, Miss Alice, that the angels
understand the language of the flowers, and the trees,
and of all living things?"</p>

<p>"I suppose they must."</p>

<p>"And did I not tell you I had been taught by the
angels?"</p>

<p>"You did, Peter; but I did not think of that."</p>

<p>"I have something more to tell you, too, Miss Alice.
I am going away; and, where I go, they will be sad if I
get angry."</p>

<p>"Going away! Where?"</p>

<p>"I am going to live with my mother: she told me
last night that she was coming after me soon."</p>

<p>"Going to die!"</p>

<p>"My mother is not dead."</p>

<p>"She is what they call dead: we can not see her."</p>

<p>"I can see her when she comes to me; I can hear
her when she talks to me; and she tells me that their
songs have a note of sadness in them when those they
love do that which is not right: but come, let us go
down among the pebbles at the foot of the great rock,
just where the little brook flows into the creek. I want
to talk to you about them; for, after I go with mother, it
will be a long time before I can talk with you again."</p>

<p>"And will you come and talk to me as your mother
does to you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know how nor when; but I shall talk with
you, for mother says so. You will live to see and hear
wonderful things, Miss Alice; but there is a cloud between

<!-- page 39 -->

now and then,&mdash;a big, dark cloud, with bright
lightnings and rolling thunders. Oh! those bright lightnings
are to clear your eyesight, and the thunder to
make you hear better. You will see and hear,&mdash;you
will see and hear. But here we are among the pebbles:
let us talk about them."</p>

<p>A few days after the above conversation, Peter was
taken very sick, and, after a few hours of severe suffering,
went, as he had said, to his mother. The event
made a deep impression on the mind of Alice; for she
thought, if one part of what he said becomes true, why
not the other?</p>

<p>From this time forth, Alice Vale seemed a changed
being. She wandered in the fields and woods as before
but seldom; and, when she did, she appeared to
take but little pleasure in her accustomed haunts. When
rallied upon the subject by her young companions, she
replied, "What is the use? I never go but I see something
I do not understand; and there is no one to tell me
about it now."</p>

<p>"Only listen to her!" exclaimed half a dozen voices
at once: "one would think, to hear her talk, that Crazy
Pete knew every thing."</p>

<p>"I wish I knew half as much," said she, in a tone that
forbade further remark upon the subject. And for years
afterward she never referred to him in any manner whatever;
and, when others did, she was silent. She became
very thoughtful; was more attentive to the wishes of
her parents; and people said, "It is a good thing for Alice
that Pete is dead; for he held a strange influence over
her, one that was evidently injuring her."</p>

<p>Mistaken mortals, to think that influence at an end!</p>

<!-- page 40 -->

<p>Alice was in her sixteenth year the summer that
Peter died; and, beginning to grow rapidly about this
time, in a few months the change was so great, that
her friends would hardly have known her, had they met
her elsewhere. From being small for her age, and with
a child-like manner that caused people to think her
younger than she was, the reverse became true. With
her growth to womanhood came that quiet dignity which
commanded the respect of all who saw her.</p>

<p>But there was one thing in which she was not changed;
and that was in her individuality of character. True,
it was no longer the individuality of childhood, which
acts, or seems to act, more from instinct than reason:
still, it was none of the less marked. She thought and
acted for herself, as the following incident will show.
Something more than two years had passed since she
last went with Pete in search of rare flowers and curious
specimens of stone. She was nearing her eighteenth
birthday; and her mother said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Alice, I think I must give you a party on the tenth."</p>

<p>"And why on the tenth, mother?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't you remember that it is your birthday?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I had forgotten it; but will it be convenient,
mother, for us to have it at that time?"</p>

<p>"As much so as at any other; but what a strange
girl you are, Alice! Another than yourself would have
been delighted at the bare mention of the thing, instead
of stopping to start objections."</p>

<p>"I am pleased with the idea, mother,&mdash;glad that you
think me worthy of such a favor; but, if the party is to
be for me, I shall claim the privilege of selecting the
guests."</p>

<!-- page 41 -->

<p>All right, child; go and make out your list, and I
will talk with your father this evening about the necessary
preparations."</p>

<p>"Thank you, mother," said she; and, sitting down at
the desk, the required list was soon ready, and handed to
Mrs. Vale for her inspection.</p>

<p>"Why, Alice, I do not see Edward Winchester's
name here."</p>

<p>"It is not there: I do not intend to invite him."</p>

<p>"Not invite Edward Winchester!"</p>

<p>"Upon one condition I will."</p>

<p>"And what is that?"</p>

<p>"That Addie Graves be invited also."</p>

<p>"Addie Graves! You are crazy, Alice: every other
girl would leave, should she come."</p>

<p>"Why, mother?"</p>

<p>"Why! A girl that is a mother and, not a wife!"</p>

<p>"And Edward Winchester, is a father, and not a
husband."</p>

<p>"Oh! but that is different."</p>

<p>"Different only in the fact that he is the aggressive
party, and therefore the most to blame. Addie never
sought him; and, if he had left her alone in her innocence,
she would not now be a mother, and an outcast
from society."</p>

<p>"But the world does not look upon it in that light."</p>

<p>"The question is, not what the world thinks, but what
is right."</p>

<p>"But it will never do, Alice, to make a party and not
invite Edward. He belongs to one of the first families
in the place: and, more than that, your father has lately
had some heavy business transactions with Winchester

<!-- page 42 -->

&amp; Son; and, if we offend them, it might injure us in a
pecuniary point of view."</p>

<p>"Then, mother, we will not have the party at all; and
the expense of it can be saved for other purposes."</p>

<p>"But what will people say? I have already told two
or three that I intended to give you a party upon your
eighteenth birthday; and, as you are invited to other
places, it looks as though we were afraid of a little
trouble, or a little expense, if we do not return the
compliment."</p>

<p>"If my going to parties places us under a bondage
like that, I will stay at home after this."</p>

<p>"O Alice! you are incorrigible."</p>

<p>"I do not mean to be, mother: I only wish to do
what is right."</p>

<p>"But what shall I say to those who are expecting the
party?"</p>

<p>"Tell them the truth, or say that you have good
reasons for giving it up."</p>

<p>Just at this juncture, Nellie Parton, Alice's most intimate
friend, called. Almost the first question that
she asked was about the party.</p>

<p>"We are not going to have one," said Alice.</p>

<p>"Do not say we: say I, for it is all your own fault,
Alice;" and then, under the influence of the irritation
caused by her daughter's cool disposal of the matter,
Mrs. Vale told Nellie why Alice would not have the
party.</p>

<p>Now, Nellie, or little Miss Parton, as she was sometimes
called from her diminutive size, was a right-feeling
little body; but she had not the courage to assert
herself as Alice had. Still she always stood by Alice,
and gloried in her independence.</p>

<!-- page 43 -->

<p>"Good! good for you, Alice! I wish all the girls
would take the same stand; for, if ever a poor girl was
shamefully wronged, it is Addie Graves. I am going
right to Miss Manning, to tell her all about it. Winchester
is paying her some attention; and she shall know
how things stand, and what at least one person thinks
of him. I do not think she knows about Addie, for
she has not been in the place long."</p>

<p>"Don't tell her about the party, Nellie," said Mrs.
Vale: "for, if you do, she will tell some one else; and,
the first thing we know, Winchester will hear of it,
and that will make hard feelings."</p>

<p>"Let him feel hard. I shouldn't care. He ought to
know it: it might serve to lower his self-esteem a little,"
exclaimed Nellie; while Alice quietly remarked, "I
have no objection to Mr. Winchester's knowing my
opinion of him."</p>

<p>Nellie was as good as her word. She not only told
Miss Manning, but others; and twenty-four hours had
not elapsed before it came to young Winchester's ears.
He smiled quietly, and, with an air of the most consummate
self-conceit, said, "I see where the trouble lies: I
have not paid that attention to Miss Alice that I might
have done, and she takes this mode of showing her resentment.
Say nothing, John, and I can soon make
that all right;" and John, the obedient shadow of this
boastful libertine, said nothing, but waited further developments.</p>

<p>Some three weeks afterward, Mrs. Roland, the lady
whose remarks about Alice three years previous opens
this story, gave out invitations for a party; inviting only
the gentlemen, and leaving them to select the ladies.

<!-- page 44 -->

The next evening after these invitations were given out,
the Vales were much surprised at receiving a call from
young Winchester. After a few minutes' general conversation,
he turned to Alice and said, "Miss Vale, I
called to ask the pleasure of your company to Mrs.
Roland's party."</p>

<p>"Do the gentlemen have the privilege of taking more
than one lady?" asked Alice quietly.</p>

<p>"I suppose they do if they wish," said he, with a look
of extreme surprise upon his countenance. "But why
do you ask?"</p>

<p>"For no particular reason," she replied in the same
quiet tones: "only I had thought of spending that
evening with Addie Graves; but, if you will take her
too, I will go."</p>

<p>The young man arose to his feet with a face flushed
with passion, and so excited that he trembled from head
to foot. "Miss Vale, you shall repent this insult to the
latest day of your life."</p>

<p>Alice preserved her self-possession. "Mr. Winchester,"
said she, "you once thought it no disgrace to be
seen in public with Miss Graves; and, if she is not what
she then was, it is your own work."</p>

<p>Winchester strove to make some reply: but rage
choked his utterance; and, turning upon his heel, he
abruptly left the house. Mr. and Mrs. Vale were both
present, but were too much surprised at the turn things
had taken to make any remark till Mr. Winchester had
gone.</p>

<p>"O Alice!" cried Mrs. Vale, "what have you
done!" while her father said, "You are a brave girl,
Alice: would to heaven there were more such! but you

<!-- page 45 -->

have made a bitter enemy,&mdash;one who will stop at
nothing that promises to gratify his revenge. I fear that
you will yet suffer for this."</p>

<p>"I can afford to suffer in the cause of right, my
father," she replied.</p>

<p>"And to see others suffer also?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That would indeed be hard; but I could bear even
that better than the loss of self-respect."</p>

<p>"God grant that you may be called upon to bear
neither!" said he earnestly, but in a tone which showed
that he felt depressed.</p>

<p>After Mr. Vale had gone to his place of business,
Mrs. Vale sighed, and seemed inclined to utter reproaches:
but Alice looked so calm, so undisturbed, that
her heart failed her; and, with another sigh still more
emphatic than the first, she retired to her room, and
the true-hearted girl was left to her own reflections.
And what those reflections were, let those who have
dared to brave popular sins, have dared to defend the
weak against the strong, the victim against the destroyer,&mdash;let
such imagine.</p>

<p>Nelly Parton came in the next day, as usual; and
when she said, "Al, I never stop for ceremony, as you
see," Alice replied, "Neither do humming-birds."</p>

<p>"Now, Al, you are too bad to compare me to so insignificant
a thing as that, even if it is beautiful."</p>

<p>"Choice goods are done up in small parcels," continued
Alice smiling.</p>

<p>"Hush, flatterer! but what was Ed Winchester doing
here last night: Charley said he saw him go out of
here, and he looked as if lightning had struck him."</p>

<p>"He came to invite me to Mrs. Roland's party."</p>

<!-- page 46 -->

<p>Nelly opened her blue eyes to their utmost capacity,
and uttered the single ejaculation, "You!"</p>

<p>"Yes, me, little puss: what is there so strange in
that?"</p>

<p>"But you are not going with him?"</p>

<p>"I told him I would if he would take Addie Graves
too; but that idea did not seem to suit him, so he declined
the honor."</p>

<p>"That accounts for it."</p>

<p>"Accounts for what?"</p>

<p>"The way he looked when he left here. Charley
said he never saw such an expression on one's face in
his life."</p>

<p>"It was not a light evening: I don't see how Charley
could have seen him so plainly," said Alice.</p>

<p>"I did not ask him: but he had a lantern in his hand
when he came in, and I suppose it must have been by
the means of that. Meeting him coming out of your
gate, he would naturally hold the light so as to see who
it was. What reply did he make to your proposal?"</p>

<p>"He was very angry, and said I should repent the
insult."</p>

<p>"Insult! I don't wonder he is ashamed of his own
work."</p>

<p>"He does not act as if he was."</p>

<p>"Well, he ought to be, the contemptible fellow! But
why is it, Alice, that a man can crush a woman thus,
and the blame be all laid to her? I am sure I could
never see any justice in it."</p>

<p>"There is none; but it will always be thus so long
as men are a privileged class."</p>

<p>"A privileged class! what do you mean by that?"

<!-- page 47 -->

<p>"I mean that they have rights under the law that
woman has not. If there is a law that does not suit
them, they can vote to have it changed; if one of them
commits a crime, the sheriff, judges, jury, and all, are
men. Can a woman vote to have bad laws made better?
Can a woman, if she has done a wrong that the
law can take hold of,&mdash;can she have the case tried by
women? and this is but a small part of what I might
mention as evidence that men are a privileged class."</p>

<p>"I didn't know, Alice, that you were for 'Woman's
Rights.' "</p>

<p>"Neither am I in the sense that most people understand
that term. I would have woman as God made
her,&mdash;woman, and not man; but I would have her
man's equal before the law: now she is not. She may
be&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">'His empress, or his slave,<br/>

Or his discarded jest,'&mdash;</p>

<p>but never his equal in aught wherein she can actively
put forth her energies: it is only when she is to be
punished or taxed that the equality comes in. By his
own showing, he is not to be trusted; and yet he claims
and holds the right to make laws for woman to protect
and control her."</p>

<p>"And how does he show that he is not to be trusted?
I have never seen any thing to make me think that
men were less truthful than women," said Nelly
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not: but what does such treatment as Addie
Graves has received at the hands of Edward Winchester
and of society say? Why, that society at large

<!-- page 48 -->

recognizes the fact, that man's word is not to be trusted
where matters of vital importance to woman are concerned;
yea, that his solemn oath, his strongest asseverations,
are so worthless, that the woman who shows
sufficient confidence therein to place herself in his power
is looked upon as a weak fool. I say that society everywhere
recognizes this as a fact; and man, instead of
resenting the insinuation, glories in it, says by his
acts, Why, really, here is a woman who believed I
spoke the truth, who actually thought that I could be
trusted. Ha, ha, ha, what a fool!"</p>

<p>"Why, Alice, you would make a good lawyer!"</p>

<p>"And I should not object to being one, if I might
thus aid the right, might plead the cause of the helpless;
but this is one of the privileges that woman may not
share: man makes law, man pleads law; woman only
obeys."</p>

<p>"Hark! What is that?" exclaimed Nelly, starting
to her feet, and listening intently.</p>

<p>"What? I heard nothing."</p>

<p>"I thought I heard a shriek&mdash;there it is again;"
and both girls rushed to the door to behold a sight that
chilled their blood with horror.</p>

<p class="small">COALS OF FIRE.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">"If thine enemy hunger, feed him; for in so doing thou shalt heap
coals of fire upon his head."&mdash;Bible.</p>

<p>WHEN Edward Winchester left Mr. Vale's,
the night before, his anger amounted almost
to phrensy. The coolness of Alice,
and the justice of her remarks, maddened
him to that degree that he hardly knew
what he was doing. "The proud minx!" exclaimed he
aloud, as soon as he had reached his room; "I'll humble
her yet; I'll teach her that she can not insult me
with impunity."</p>

<p>"But did she not tell you the truth?" whispered
conscience: "was it not your own work that she held
up to your view?"</p>

<p>"My work! damn a woman that can't take care of
herself," he continued in the same excited tones, as he
walked rapidly back and forth across the room.</p>

<p>"How now, Winchester! what's up?"</p>

"That's my business," he replied, scarcely waiting to
see who the speaker was.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon for intruding; but I found your
door open, and you did not answer my rap," said the
young man, in tones which showed that he was offended.</p>

<!-- page 50 -->

<p>Winchester looked up. "Excuse me, Bronson; but
I am vexed to-night: I meant no offense to you."</p>

<p>"Then I will leave you till you are in better humor."</p>

<p>"There," said Winchester, as the door closed behind
his friend,&mdash;"there, I have offended a friend as the first
step toward accomplishing my object. I must keep
cool, or I shall spoil every thing;" and, locking the door
to prevent further intrusion, he sat far into the night,
revolving plans that would help him to triumph over
the girl who had dared to tell him the truth.</p>

<p>The next morning he arose with the same restless
feeling upon him; and, after trying in vain to fasten his
mind upon business, he resolved to take an excursion
into the country. Going to one of the stables to get a
horse, he was told that they had none for him except
one that was so fractious and high-lifed that he was not
considered safe for any but the most experienced riders.</p>

<p>"Let me have him: I am not afraid of him."</p>

<p>"If you take him, Winchester, you do so at your
own risk; but I would advise you not to try to ride
him," said the groom.</p>

<p>"I tell you I am not afraid of him: bring him out,"
was the impatient reply; and then to himself, "I want
something that has some fire: it will do me good." The
horse was brought out, but behaved so badly that he
was again urged not to ride him.</p>

<p>But Winchester replied, "I will ride him, or die in
the attempt;" and, mounting the determined-looking
beast, he started off with a brisk trot. The horse went
very well for about half a mile; but, in crossing a small
bridge, some hogs started up from beneath it. Making

<!-- page 51 -->

this an excuse for a scare, the creature, who had all
along showed mischief in his eye, turned, and started
upon a full run for town. So fleet was his motion, that
Winchester could hardly keep his seat, much less check
and turn back the fiery animal. Just as they reached
the main part of the village, the horse made a quick
movement, that threw his rider from his back; but his
feet catching in the stirrup, he was dragged along at a
rate that threatened instant death; and this was what
Alice and Nelly saw as they reached the door.</p>

<p>As fate would have it, Addie Graves came around
the corner just at the moment her false lover was thrown;
and it was her shriek that Nelly had heard.</p>

<p>"O Alice, Alice, he will be killed!" exclaimed
Nelly.</p>

<p>"I fear he is that already," replied Alice, as she
looked at the pale bleeding form, which was at the moment
freed from contact with the stirrup, and left lying
close by their gate.</p>

<p>By this time quite a crowd had collected; and Addie
was slipping away, when Alice, seeing the movement,
stepped quickly to her side and said, "Go into the house
Addie, and stay in my room till I can come to you."</p>

<p>The poor girl looked the thanks she could not speak,
as she availed herself of this opportunity of being near
the man she still loved, though he had so cruelly
wronged her, till it could be ascertained what his injuries
really were. As the mother of his child, she
should have been by his side: but no, that might not
be; for the curious, questioning eyes of those who condemned
her because he had led her into wrong, and
then forsaken her, was more than her sensitive nature
could endure.</p>

<!-- page 52 -->

<p>"Gracious heaven, what an anomaly is this! In all
other cases, the tempter is looked upon as the most to
blame, and is treated accordingly; but here he is exonerated,
or mostly so, while the weight of public indignation
falls upon the tempted. There is a reason
for this somewhere; but who shall find and hold it up
successfully to the view of the world?" Such were
the thoughts of Alice as she marked the looks of contempt
cast upon Addie during the few moments that
she mingled with the crowd.</p>

<p>Young Winchester was taken up in a senseless condition,
and carried into Mr. Vale's; while the hastily-summoned
physician proceeded to examine his wounds.
He reported one broken ankle, one dislocated wrist,
beside bruises external and internal.</p>

<p>"Can he live?" was the anxious question that was
next asked.</p>

<p>"I see nothing to prevent it if he has careful nursing:
but he can not be moved for a month at the least; and if
fever sets in, as I fear it will, it may be longer."</p>

<p>"What if his friends call to see him?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"His parents will be admitted of course, but none
others; for he must be kept as quiet as possible."</p>

<p>"His parents are not in town."</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>"They started last week on a visiting tour through
New England, and do not expect to return under two
months."</p>

<p>The doctor looked anxious.</p>

<p>"Do not be uneasy, doctor," said Mrs. Vale: "he
shall be cared for as if he were my own son. Henry,
our boy of all work, if he is but sixteen, is as good as a

<!-- page 53 -->

woman to wait upon the sick; and Alice, I am sure, will
do her best."</p>

<p>"I certainly shall," said Alice; "but, doctor, I would
like to talk with you a minute."</p>

<p>He stepped aside; and his countenance brightened at
the few words that were spoken in his ear. "I wish
it could be so," said he: "but it would occasion remark;
and, if not, he would not consent to it."</p>

<p>"Are not persons in his condition apt to be deranged
when fever sets in?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Very apt to be; and his head is so jarred, that
he is not exactly himself now. Indeed, I don't think
he realized, at any time while I was dressing his wounds,
what the trouble was."</p>

<p>"If you will leave it to me, doctor, I will manage it
so that he will not be excited; neither shall there be
any remarks made. All I ask is, positive orders from
you that there shall be no one admitted to his room except
those who have the care of him."</p>

<p>"I shall certainly do that, for the necessity of the
case demands it; and will promise silence, and my aid
in carrying out your plan as far as is possible."</p>

<p>"Thank you, doctor."</p>

<p>Alice next went to her mother. Here she found
more opposition. "What will people say?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I do not intend that they shall know it,&mdash;not at
present, at least."</p>

<p>"Ah! but they will find it out," said Mrs. Vale,
shaking her head: "you can not keep such things from
the public."</p>

<p>"And what if they do, mother."</p>

<p>"What if they do? Why, we shall lose our reputation.

<!-- page 54 -->

People will say that we justify such conduct,
Alice. I tell you I don't want her in the house."</p>

<p>"But she is here, mother; and I don't want her to
leave.</p>

<p>"Is here: where?"</p>

<p>"In my room."</p>

<p>"O Alice! Alice! Who ever saw such a girl!
I thought, after Crazy Pete died, that you were learning
some sense; but I had as soon you would run in the
woods, and climb trees, as to do as you are doing now."</p>

<p>"When I was a child, I behaved like a child, was
true to my child-nature; but now that I am a woman,
with all due deference to you, mother, I wish to be true
to my womanhood," said Alice, tears filling her eyes.</p>

<p>"And do you call it being true to your womanhood,&mdash;this
sustaining those that have been false to theirs?"</p>

<p>"But, mother, suppose it was your own daughter?"</p>

<p>"She should no longer be a daughter of mine!"</p>

<p>"But you would take her destroyer into the house,
and care for him?"</p>

<p>"No: I don't think I could quite do that," said Mrs.
Vale, softening a little at the thought of such a contingency.</p>

<p>"Well, remember, mother dear, that poor Addie lost
her mother just at the time that she needed her the
most."</p>

<p>"I know it: I know it, child; and I have always felt
sorry for her: but I can not, on that account, permit
you to take a step that would compromise you. No,
no, it can not be: I shall not consent to it," she continued,
in response to the pleading look that was cast
upon her.</p>

<!-- page 55 -->

<p>Alice began to fear that she was to be defeated; but
just then her father came in. "What is all this that
I hear of Winchester's being nearly killed?" said he.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vale told him the state of the case as near as
she could, and then added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And Alice, foolish child, is determined to have
Addie Graves here to help take care of him."</p>

<p>"And why not?" said Mr. Vale.</p>

<p>"Why not! You men never do have any sense: it
will not do at all, and you ought to know it."</p>

<p>"I must confess, wife, that I can not see why it will
not do. Alice, my child, what is your object in wishing
Addie here?"</p>

<p>"Why, father, I have always noticed, that, when
people were suffering, they are apt to be more tender-hearted,
more ready to feel for the sufferings of others
and"&mdash;</p>

<p>"And you thought, perhaps, that if he could see
Addie now,&mdash;could know she was ready to care for him,
notwithstanding all that has passed,&mdash;that his heart
might soften toward her, and he be willing to do her justice
by making her his wife?"</p>

<p>"I had thought of that, father; but there is another
thing. The doctor says that he must have the best of
nursing, or he will not live: now, what is there that
will make so good a nurse of one as devoted love?"</p>

<p>"You are right, my child; and it shall be as you
wish"&mdash;</p>

<p>"But"&mdash;</p>

<p>"No buts in the matter, Mrs. Vale. I do not often
oppose your plans, nor interfere with your wishes; but
this thing shall be as I say."</p>

<!-- page 56 -->

<p>"O father!" said Alice deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"I am not angry, child, only in earnest: now go
your way, and your father will see that there shall no
blame fall on your head."</p>

<p>Thus dismissed, Alice hastened to her own room,
where she found poor Addie lying upon the bed with
her face nearly as white as the pillow upon which her
head rested.</p>

<p>"O Alice! is he alive?" she gasped, staggering to
her feet.</p>

<p>"Yes, alive, and with good nursing will recover;
so the doctor says."</p>

<p>"Thank God! thank God!" she exclaimed; and,
sinking back upon the bed, burst into a passion of
weeping.</p>

<p>"Addie," said Alice, when she had grown somewhat
calm,&mdash;"Addie, do you still love that man?"</p>

<p>"Love him! I would give my soul for his to-day,
as cruelly as he has wronged me," was her quick and
emphatic reply.</p>

<p>"He is not worthy of such love," said Alice; "but,
Addie, the doctor said that he would get well with good
nursing: where shall we find a good nurse?"</p>

<p>Looking a moment into Alice's face, as if to gather
her full meaning, the poor girl clasped her hands and
said, "O Alice! if I only might."</p>

<p>"And so you shall: you and I together; for you can
not do it all. It is all arranged: the doctor says he
must see no one, only those who have the care of him.
I have pledged them all to silence, except Betty the
kitchen-girl; and she will do any thing I wish. You
can come, and the neighbors will be none the wiser."</p>

<!-- page 57 -->

<p>"What shall I do with my baby?"</p>

<p>"Have you weaned him?"</p>

<p>"No; but it is time that I had."</p>

<p>"Well, then, send him out to Aunt Chloe for that
purpose."</p>

<p>"Aunt Chloe who?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't you know? the black woman who lives
up by the steam-mill. It is only a mile from town. I
will write a note for you, and you can take your baby
there this afternoon: it will be all right."</p>

<p>"All right if I can get father's consent; but he is so
incensed against Edward that I fear he will not give it."</p>

<p>"I will go and see him myself," said Alice. "I believe
I am rather a favorite with him, and I don't think
he will refuse me."</p>

<p>Alice had a harder task than she had supposed: but
she succeeded at last; and the next night found Addie
Graves watching beside the bedside of the man, who, of
all others, should have been her best and truest friend.
But, alas! past events had proved him far otherwise.</p>

<p>The sick man was in a high fever, tossing hither and
thither, as much as his wounds would permit,&mdash;at times
moaning piteously with pain, and then again living over
the scenes of the past, as was shown by disconnected
sentences and incoherent mutterings.</p>

<p>At one time he would be talking to Addie, pleading,
in soft insinuating tones, the promises that had worked
her ruin; and at others he would curse her for being
such a weak fool as to believe him.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when she rested her soft hand upon his
forehead, or passed it gently across his temples, in her
efforts to soothe him, he would say, "That feels like

<!-- page 58 -->

Addie's hand: I wonder if she loves me well enough
to follow me to hell. Surely this is hell. How hot it
is! nothing&mdash;nothing cool but this soft hand." And
then he would curse Alice for minding that which was
none of her business. "But&mdash;but she told me the truth&mdash;the
truth&mdash;the truth," he would fairly shriek; till,
falling back upon his pillow, his voice sank lower and
lower, and was lost at last in fitful slumber.</p>

<p>Poor Addie. It was a hard place for her; but
bravely did she fill it, till, at length, he would not be
content without her. No one but her could give him
his food: no hand but hers could smooth his pillow to
suit him.</p>

<p>Alice watched the progress of things, and hoped
much therefrom: still, she trembled as well as longed
for the moment when he should awake to consciousness,
as so much depended upon the first impression
made upon his mind then.</p>

<p>His symptoms were growing better, his sleep less
disturbed and of longer duration; and the physician said
that he was liable to awake at any time, perfectly sane.</p>

<p>One day, when he had slept unusually long, Addie,
who had not slept the night before, fell into a drowse
herself. A slight movement on his part aroused her;
and, looking up, she beheld his eyes fixed upon her with
the old look of intelligence in them.</p>

<p>Her presence of mind forsook her; and she could not
utter a word, but sat for one moment like to one paralyzed,
and the next arose, and glided from the room.</p>

<p>He did not speak, nor attempt to detain her; and,
when Alice came in just after, he responded to her salutation,
and inquiries after his health, as if it was the

<!-- page 59 -->

most natural thing in the world that he should be there,
and in the condition he was.</p>

<p>After a few moments' silence on both sides, he said,
"Miss Vale, I need not ask you how I came here: the
last recollection I have is of being thrown to the ground,
and dragged furiously along. I suppose, that, by some
means, I must have got loose from the stirrup, and have
been brought in here. All after that seems like a
frightful dream, in which I thought I was in hell, and
that an angel was trying to get me out."</p>

<p>"Well, that is past, and you are better now," said
Alice, more agitated than at any time previous,&mdash;even
more so than when she had seen him taken up for dead
at her father's gate.</p>

<p>"Yes: I am better now," he responded, and, turning
his head away, indicated no disposition to converse
further.</p>

<p>Alice slipped through the door, where Addie stood
in a suspense that hardly permitted her to breathe.
"Wait! be patient," said she in a hurried whisper,
"and it will all be right;" and then returned again to
her post.</p>

<p>After lying quiet for perhaps twenty minutes, he
turned toward Alice again, and said, "I have been
conscious longer than you are aware of, Miss Vale:
now, why did you get Miss Graves to help take care of
me?"</p>

<p>"I had several reasons, Mr. Winchester; one of
which was, the doctor said, that, unless you had careful
nursing, you would not recover."</p>

<p>"And you think she could take better care of me
than others?"</p>

<!-- page 60 -->

<p>"I knew, Mr. Winchester, that love is the most
faithful of watchers," replied Alice, having so far recovered
her self-possession as to look him calmly in the
face.</p>

<p>"Do you believe that she loves me still?"</p>

<p>"I know that she does," was the reply.</p>

<p>"And another reason?" he continued.</p>

<p>"I hoped to see your better nature so aroused that
you would do her justice," was the firm response.</p>

<p>"Then you do not think me wholly bad?" he asked,
with an air of humility in his tones so unlike his
former self that Alice could hardly believe her own
ears.</p>

<p>"Not by any means, Mr. Winchester."</p>

<p>He sighed, lay silent again for a time; and, when he
next looked up, it was to ask,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you send Miss Graves here, Miss Vale?"</p>

<p>What passed in that room for the next hour is too
sacred for the public ear: but, ere the sun had withdrawn
the last evidence of his smiling face, Addie Graves was
a wife; and, from thenceforth, there was no need of
concealment, for the world acknowledged her right to
watch by the bedside of her husband. When <i>he had
done her justice</i>, then others were willing to.</p>

<p>"ALICE," said Mr. Vale to his daughter, one
evening some three months after the marriage
of Winchester and Addie,&mdash;"Alice,
it seems to me that you and Brown's
clerk are getting quite too friendly."</p>

<p>"Which one?" asked Alice demurely: "he has
three, and I am acquainted with them all."</p>

<p>"Which one! you know well enough, without asking,
you jade; and you had better not let me catch John
Shepherd here again very soon."</p>

<p>"What harm is there in him, father?"</p>

<p>"Harm! none that I know of, only he will be wanting
to marry you next."</p>

<p>"And what if he should, father?" said Alice, in those
quiet tones that mean so much.</p>

<p>Mr. Vale looked at her a moment in silence. Should
he arouse the opposition of her determined spirit by
laying his commands upon her? or should he take some
other course to separate them? These were the questions
that he was debating in his mind. He feared the

<!-- page 62 -->

effect of the former course, but shrank from taking the
latter; for he despised every thing that looked like underhanded
dealing. At length he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Alice, you will never marry that man with my
consent."</p>

<p>"I am sorry, father," she replied; "for then I shall
have to marry him without it."</p>

<p>"If you do, you are no longer a child of mine," he
exclaimed excitedly; for her cool self-possession so
maddened him that he entirely forgot his resolutions of
prudence.</p>

<p>"Husband, O husband! don't say that," said Mrs.
Vale entreatingly; but he turned upon her such a look
that she dared not say more.</p>

<p>Mr. Vale was a singular man,&mdash;in many respects an
excellent one. He was usually an indulgent husband
and a kind father: but there was a streak of tyranny in
his nature, which, when aroused, brooked no opposition;
and his wife had long since learned this fact.
And, withal, he had a species of pride that was none
the less real because it did not appear upon the surface.
He had, as I have said in the opening chapter, figured
once as a merchant of some note in New-York City;
but, having failed there, came and settled in this little
village, to continue the same business on a small scale.
Notwithstanding his suavity of manner, he had always
felt a sort of contempt for the people of the place; and
this was one reason why he had cared so little when
Alice, in carrying out her own ideas of things, had
provoked their remarks, and brought their criticisms
down upon her.</p>

<p>True, he liked to see independence of character, when

<!-- page 63 -->

such independence did not interfere with his cherished
plans. And, more than this, what difference did it make
if they did find fault with his child? They were not
her equals. Such were his most secret feelings, though
hardly acknowledged even to himself.</p>

<p>Some of their old acquaintances from the city&mdash;sons
of wealthy men, who had been the schoolmates of Alice
in childhood&mdash;often came to the country in the summer;
and one or more of them frequently spent weeks at his
house. And the proudly fond father had secretly hoped
that some one of them would marry Alice, and reinstate
her in her old position in society, or, rather, in the
one she would have occupied had he remained in the
city and continued successful.</p>

<p>He saw no reason why this should not be; and, through
the influence of such a marriage, he might regain, partially
at least, an <i>entr&eacute;e</i> into the social circles from which
he now felt himself excluded. But, should Alice wed
a poor clerk, these hopes would be dashed to the ground:
hence his excitability upon the subject.</p>

<p>It was not ten minutes after the above conversation
before young Shepherd himself appeared upon the scene.</p>

<p>"Mr. Shepherd," said Mr. Vale, turning fiercely upon
him, "I find that you are presuming upon the hand of
my daughter. Leave this house, sir, and never dare to
enter it again."</p>

<p>"Does your daughter acquiesce in this decision," inquired
the young man, turning to Alice.</p>

<p>"My daughter will do as I say," exclaimed Mr. Vale,
pointing to the door.</p>

<p>Alice was about to speak, but a second thought restrained
her: she gave her lover a look, however,

<!-- page 64 -->

which so far satisfied him that he left without another
word.</p>

<p>"There, that matter is settled: now, don't let me hear
of any more such nonsense, Miss Alice;" but, as he
looked into her quiet face, he felt a doubt as to the
matter's being really settled, after all. He expected
either a storm of reproaches, or a flood of tears; but he
met neither. "I must watch her," was his mental resolve,
"or she will be too much for me yet."</p>

<p>The next morning, soon after breakfast, Alice called
on Mrs. Winchester. Addie met her with a glowing
face of welcome. "O Alice! I am so glad to see
you; but what makes you look so sober: is any one
sick?"</p>

<p>"No: we are all as well as usual," replied Alice; "but
father has forbidden John Shepherd the house; and I
want you to help me a little, that is all."</p>

<p>Addie lifted up her hands in astonishment. "Forbidden
him the house! What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"He thinks I am going to marry him, which I certainly
intend to do."</p>

<p>"But how can I help you, Alice?"</p>

<p>"In the first place, say nothing of this, not even to
your husband, till I give you permission; and, in the
next, find means to put this note into Mr. Shepherd's
hands as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"I will do both with all my heart; for I can never
half repay the obligation I am under for your past
kindness."</p>

<p>"Do not speak of that: I am more than paid for the
past; 'tis the present we have to deal with," said Alice
smiling; "but I must return home, or I shall be missed."</p>

<!-- page 65 -->

<p>That afternoon, when Mrs. Winchester went into
Mr. Brown's store, she so managed it that it was John
Shepherd who waited upon her, instead of the clerk
who usually claimed that honor; and, when she left,
the young man found himself in the possession of the
following note:&mdash;</p>

<p>DEAR JOHN,&mdash;Be patient, and all will yet be right.
Do not seek me at present, but rest assured that I shall
prove true to you. Destroy this when you have read
it, to prevent accidents; for my father will leave no
stone unturned in seeking to know if we hold any
correspondence.</p>

<p>From your own</p>

<p>ALICE.</p>

<p>"Bless her true heart!" was the lover's mental exclamation,
as he looked the note over carefully for the
second time, and then, putting it into his mouth, commenced
the process of destruction by masticating it
finely. "Bless her true heart! still, this underhanded
way of doing business goes against my feelings. How
much better it would be to have every thing open and
above board!"</p>

<p>"Hallo, there, Jack! are you learning to chew tobacco?"
said a fellow-clerk to him, as he returned to his
post.</p>

<p>"Not exactly," was the reply; but, in saying this, he
drew in his breath in such a manner that the paper
choked and set him to coughing. With the first cough,
it was thrown half way across the room. Shepherd and
the other young man, whose name was Holten, both

<!-- page 66 -->

started for it; but Holten reached it first, and refused to
give it up.</p>

<p>It was in vain that Shepherd coaxed and threatened
by turns. The paper was so mutilated that it could not
be read; but Shepherd did not know this, and Holten
kept it for a purpose of his own. "It is some love-letter,
I will warrant," said Holten laughingly; "and
he could not get enough of it without eating it."</p>

<p>Shepherd colored so violently at this, that Mr. Brown
and the other clerk joined with Holten in teasing him,
till the day was far spent before the subject was forgotten;
and it would not have been dropped even then,
but a rush of custom put it out of their minds.</p>

<p>They did not revert to it again: still, Shepherd could
not help feeling anxious; but as day after day passed,
and nothing further was heard from it, he at length
concluded that Holten had not been able to read aught
that the note contained, and ceased worrying about the
matter. In the mean time, how fared it with Alice?</p>

<p>To all outward appearances about as usual. She
neither moped nor fretted, but went cheerfully about
her accustomed duties, as though nothing had happened
out of the ordinary course of things; but one who
could have looked beneath the surface would have seen
there a calm determination, a firmness of purpose, that
it were not well to oppose.</p>

<p>Her father watched her closely. "It can not be,"
said he to himself, "that she is going to yield so easily:
I must keep my eye upon her, for I fear she means
mischief;" but as week after week passed, and he saw
no signs of any communication between her and Shepherd,
he gradually relaxed his vigilance.</p>

<!-- page 67 -->

<p>Something more than a month after Shepherd had
been thus summarily ejected from the house, the elder
Vales were agreeably surprised by a visit from the only
son of an old friend, who was one of the wealthiest of
their circle of acquaintances in the city; and, what was
more, Mr. Vale was well aware that the elder Sawtelle
desired good substantial personal qualities, more than
he did wealth, as the portion of the woman who should
become the wife of his son.</p>

<p>"Just the thing! just the thing!" ejaculated Mr.
Vale, rubbing his hands. "Young Sawtelle is unexceptionable
in every way,&mdash;rich, handsome, intelligent:
and I'll warrant old Sawtelle has sent him here on purpose;
for those city girls are of no account, and he
knows it. Wife, if we manage this thing right, we can
go back to the city, and take our old place in society
yet."</p>

<p>"If it could only be, Mr. Vale, I should like it very
much," she replied; "but Alice is hard to manage. I
feel very certain that she has not given up Shepherd
yet, as quiet as she is."</p>

<p>"Why? What have you seen?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing; but, if she does not carry her point, I
am mistaken in her."</p>

<p>"She shall not! She shall not! I would rather
bury her!" he exclaimed, starting up and walking
rapidly back and forth across the room.</p>

<p>"O husband! Don't say such terrible things.
Think how you would feel to see her in her coffin, and
she our only remaining one."</p>

<p>"Better thus than married to that beggar," was the
irate reply. Mrs. Vale said nothing further, for she

<!-- page 68 -->

saw that it was of no use; but her heart was with her
child. Though a weak woman in some respects, she
was all right upon this point. Experience had taught
her the lesson, that wealth alone can not bring happiness.
She had, in her girlhood, loved one who was considered
beneath her,&mdash;had given him up, and married to please
her parents, while her heart cried out at the sacrifice;
consequently, her life had been one of endurance,
instead of happiness. Under the influence of such a
memory, she hoped, in her secret soul, that Alice would
not yield, as she had done.</p>

<p>Her husband seemed to feel something of this; for,
suddenly facing her, he said, "Wife, if I know of your
countenancing that girl in her folly, you will go too; for
I will not be defeated in this thing,&mdash;I tell you I will
not."</p>

<p>Mrs. Vale had never seen her husband in quite such
a state of excitement; and it alarmed her. She hastened
to quiet him, by giving him every assurance in her power
that she would do nothing to thwart, but what she
could to aid him.</p>

<p>Alice was an unintentional listener to the above conversation
between her parents; and she laid her plans
accordingly. She watched Mr. Sawtelle closely; taking
care, at the same time, not to give him the least encouragement.
It was not long before she perceived
that he was interested: so much so that the love-light
began to flash from his eye at her approach; and she felt
that it would not be long ere he would ask her father
for permission to address her. And then another note
found its way into the hands of John Shepherd. It ran
thus,&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 69 -->

<p>DEAR JOHN,&mdash;The crisis must come. If Mr. Sawtelle
asks my father for my hand (as I feel that he
will), and I refuse, his anger will be terrible. I had
hoped, by quiet waiting, to soften down his opposition
to our union: but I see that it is useless; and the best
thing that can be done is to put it beyond his power to
separate us. Have every thing in readiness, and meet
me at Edward Winchester's to-morrow evening at eight
o'clock, or half-past. Be very cautious in your movements;
for, if discovered before it is too late, father will
stop at nothing that in his estimation would effectually
prevent our marriage.</p>

<p>Faithfully yours, ALICE.</p>

<p>This note found its destination in the same way that
the first one did. Shepherd, of course, retired as soon
as possible, in order to ascertain its contents. Holten
was watching him, for he suspected what was going on.
Not that he cared; but, as I have said, he had a purpose
of his own to serve. The first one John had put into
his mouth; and, having been ejected therefrom in the
manner related, Holten had got possession of it. And,
though so mutilated that it could not be read, there were
two words, that, when examined closely, were quite
legible; and they were, "Destroy this."</p>

<p>With this, the second one, Shepherd was even more
unfortunate. "I will see this time," said he to himself,
"that it is fully destroyed;" and, lighting a match, he
set it on fire. Just at this moment Holten called,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Shepherd, Shepherd, come here, quick!" John,
thinking the paper beyond recovery, dropped it upon the
stove, and hastened to see what was wanted.</p>

<!-- page 70 -->

<p>"Oh, you are too late! they have gone around the
corner."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Why, the oddest-looking couple that you ever saw:
I should think they had just come out of Noah's Ark."</p>

<p>"Who is it that you are speaking of? I saw no one
of that description," said the other clerk, who was standing
outside of the door at the time.</p>

<p>"Oh! you never see any thing, old Sobersides," replied
Holten laughing. He then managed to get the
two into earnest conversation, when, slipping into the
back room, he found the piece of burnt paper upon the
stove-hearth. He gathered it up quickly but carefully,
and placed it in his pocket-book; and, taking another
piece, lighted it, and, putting it exactly on the spot
from which he had taken Alice's note, watched it till it
was consumed.</p>

<p>He had barely left the room when Shepherd returned.
Seeing the ashes of burnt paper lying where
he had left paper burning, he supposed that all was
right, and gave no further thought to the matter.</p>

<p>Holten, as soon as he had the opportunity, examined
that which he had saved, and found only these words
legible: "Be very cautious in your movements; for,
if discovered"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm in luck," said he to himself, as he put it carefully
aside.</p>

<p>It was less than a week after these events, that Sawtelle
sought Alice for the purpose of asking her to be
his wife. She read his purpose in his eye, as he approached
her, and sought to avoid him.</p>

<p>"Do not turn from me, dear girl," said he. "I have

<!-- page 71 -->

the permission of your parents to address you; and it
only needs that you consent to be mine to make me the
happiest of men."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Sawtelle; but
what you ask can never be," she replied calmly but
firmly.</p>

<p>"Oh, do not say that! Take back your cruel words,"
he exclaimed, with a passionate earnestness that fairly
startled her. Still, her self-possession did not forsake
her; and she answered as calmly as before,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It would be cruel for me to say otherwise, or in
any manner to give you the least hope. Mr. Sawtelle,
I have striven to avoid this; for it is not a pleasant position
for me to be placed in. The thought of giving
you pain is, of itself, painful, for I know of no one that
I more fully respect; but added to this is my father's
certain displeasure,&mdash;a displeasure so deep that I expect
he will forbid me his house, perhaps disown and
cast me off for ever. Indeed, sir, you are not the only
sufferer."</p>

<p>"But why need either of us suffer?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Sawtelle, would you take to your bosom an
unloving wife?"</p>

<p>"I certainly should not wish to; but why not give me
a chance to win your love?"</p>

<p>"I have none to give you, for it is bestowed upon
another."</p>

<p>"Irrevocably?"</p>

<p>"So irrevocably that nought but death can separate
us."</p>

<p>"Nothing but death?" said the young man, with a
look of inquiry.</p>

<!-- page 72 -->

<p>"Those are the conditions of marriage,&mdash;are they
not?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You do not mean to tell me that you are married,
Miss Vale!"</p>

<p>"I do," she replied.</p>

<p>The young man covered his face with his hands, and
groaned aloud; while Alice, feeling that her presence
was no longer needed, sought her room, and began to
make preparations for the storm of wrath that she knew
must so soon burst upon her.</p>

<p>Her first impulse was to tell her mother; but, on second
thought, concluded that it was not best to trouble her
sooner than was necessary. Quickly packing her best
clothing and a few choice keepsakes into as small a
compass as possible, she dropped them out of the window
into the back-yard; and then, descending thither herself,
she hid them in a safe place in the loft of the stable:
"For," said she to herself, "father will be so angry that
he will not permit me to take a thing, and mother will not
dare to interfere in my behalf." This done, she sat
down to wait the course of events.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Mr. Sawtelle, having recovered
somewhat from the shock that her announcement gave
him, began to make preparations for his departure to the
city; and Mr. Vale, coming home earlier than usual,
found him thus employed.</p>

<p>"What does this mean, Robert?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It means that there is no hope for me."</p>

<p>"She has not refused you?"</p>

<p>"She has."

<p>"Tut, tut, man: you are too easily disheartened.
Wait: she will come to terms yet." He had forced himself

<!-- page 73 -->

to speak calmly; but the flash of his eye, and the
palor about his lips, told of the storm within.</p>

<p>The young man looked up, and opened his lips to
speak: then, as if upon second thought, closed them
again, and went on with his work.</p>

<p>"What is it, man? speak out."</p>

<p>Sawtelle shook his head; but, upon further importuning,
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You must learn it sooner or later, Mr. Vale: she
tells me that she is already married."</p>

<p>Had an earthquake opened at his feet, or a thunder-bolt
exploded in their midst, the effect could not have
been more startling than was this announcement upon
Mr. Vale.</p>

<p>He reeled as though struck by a heavy blow, staggered
to the nearest seat, and fell rather than sat down.
"Married!" he repeated, like one bewildered,&mdash;"married!"</p>

<p>"That is what she told me," answered Sawtelle, forgetting
his own disappointment in pity for the father.</p>

<p>However, this mood lasted but a minute; and then
anger took the sway. "The disobedient jade!" he exclaimed.
"I told her I would do it; and I will. This is
no longer a home for her." And going immediately to
her room, he confronted her with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Alice, are you a married woman?"</p>

<p>"I am, father."</p>

<p>"Leave this house, then, and never dare to enter it
again."</p>

<p>"I will obey you, father, until you see proper to recall
your stern mandate," said she, commencing to
gather up her things.</p>

<!-- page 74 -->

<p>"Not a thing,&mdash;not a thing,&mdash;my lady. Go as you
are, and let the beggar you have married provide for
you."</p>

<p>"Would you have me go bareheaded through the
streets, father?"</p>

<p>"What is that to me? you are no longer a child of
mine."</p>

<p>Alice paled. She had expected this, but the reality
was worse than the anticipation. Forcing a calmness
she did not feel, she turned, and walked out of the room
and down the stairs. Her father followed her; and, as
she was about to go into her mother's room, he said,
"Not there! not there!" pointing at the same time to
the outer door.</p>

<p>This last act aroused her anger. What! not even
permitted to speak one farewell to her mother? With
flashing eye, she confronted him. "You will regret
this, sir, when it is too late;" then, with a firm step, she
walked out the front door, down the walk, through the
gate, into the street.</p>

<p>Mr. Vale, watched her till he saw the gate closed behind
her, and then he sought his wife's room. "Mrs.
Vale," said he, in a tone which showed that he thought
she derived all her importance from the fact that she
was Mrs. Vale,&mdash;"Mrs. Vale,"&mdash;then pausing till he
could get her eye fully,&mdash;"did you know aught of
this?" he continued.</p>

<p>"Know aught of what?" she asked wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Did you know that Alice was married?"</p>

<p>"Married: no, it can't be possible! When? where?"</p>

<p>"I did not ask her when, nor where. It was enough
that she acknowledged the fact. It is well for you that

<!-- page 75 -->

you had no hand in it, or I would have sent you after
her."</p>

<p>"After her? where is she?"</p>

<p>"In the street; and she will stay there unless she finds
shelter elsewhere."</p>

<p>Mrs. Vale arose to her feet. For the first time in
her married life, her spirit was fully aroused. Walking
up to her husband, she laid her hand on his arm, and,
looking him full in the face, she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"William Vale, you have not turned our child, our
only one, into the street?"</p>

<p>"I certainly have; and you will follow her if you are
not careful."</p>

<p>"As I certainly shall if you do not recall her."</p>

<p>This was more than the man had dreamed of. Not
only had his child defeated his plans, but his wife defied
him,&mdash;the woman who had always submitted to his will,
and from whom he had expected only submission,&mdash;that
woman was daring to have a will of her own.</p>

<p>"William," said she, seeing him hesitate, "I have
always been a good, faithful wife to you, as you well
know; and have I no rights here that you are bound to
respect, that you should thus turn our child, my child,
from our door, without permitting her even to see her
mother? Surely, it is not your own proper self that
acts: you are blind with excitement. Oh, say that you
will recall her before this thing goes any further!"</p>

<p>"Recall her,&mdash;never!" he fairly shouted. "You are
just fit, both of you, to go out lecturing upon woman's
rights; and I'll have no such fanatical nonsense about
my house. Why didn't you say <i>my door</i>, as well as <i>my
child?</i>"</p>

<!-- page 76 -->

<p>"Mr. Vale, you say <i>my house</i>; and, if man and wife
are one, I have as good a right to say it as you: but I
ask once more, and for the last time, will you permit
our child to return?"</p>

<p>"And for the last time, madam, I tell you I never
will."</p>

<p>"Then I, too, shall go; but first I will tell you that
which I never intended to reveal to any one, much less
to yourself. William Vale, you have, for the most
part, been a kind husband, as the world calls kindness.
When one has their own way, it is easy to be good; and
you have always had it as far as I am concerned: but
had I been as true to my own heart as our child has
been to hers, I had never married you.</p>

<p>"I followed the wishes of my parents, instead of my
own; and oh! how many, many times during the first
years of our marriage, did I say to myself, 'If I had it
to do again, my hand should go with my heart.' I had
sealed my own fate, however; and there was no going
back from the sacrifice I had made: but our child has
been firm, and from my inmost soul I am glad of it."</p>

<p>"And pray who was it upon whom you had placed
your virgin affections?" asked he with a sneer.</p>

<p>She looked at him a moment, as if debating the question,
and then replied, "Robert Sawtelle's father; and
now farewell, for this is no place for me after the revelation
I have made." Saying this, she walked deliberately
out of the room; but, just as she had closed the
door behind her, her steps were arrested by the sound
of a heavy fall. On going back to learn the cause, she
found Mr. Vale lying upon the floor, with the blood gushing
from his nostrils. The excitement had been too intense:

<!-- page 77 -->

nature had given way, and the strong man was
prostrate.</p>

<p>The screams of Mrs. Vale brought the neighbors.
The doctor was called; but it was too late. He had
broken a blood-vessel; and Alice had not been absent
more than three-quarters of an hour before she was
summoned back to look upon her father's corpse.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="small">TELLING TALES.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">"Dead men can tell no tales," 'tis said;<br/>

When lo! the voice of nature cries,<br/>

"Mistaken man, there are no dead."</p>

<p>FAR away on the borders of some Western
prairie, where to-day there is no habitation
but such as the wolf or the fox, and
kindred animals, furnish for themselves,
to-morrow there may be a rude cabin,
and the next day four or five; the next week a score;
and, ere a year has rolled around, the wilderness of
flowers will have given place to a wilderness of houses.</p>

<p>It is to such a place as this,&mdash;one that had sprung up
almost in a night, but not, like Jonah's gourd, to wither
in a night,&mdash;that I would now call your attention.</p>

<p>People were coming from all directions. North,
South, East, and West, each furnished its quota. The
shrewd Yankee, the phlegmatic Englishman, the lively
Frenchman, the honest German, the witty Irishman,&mdash;all,
all, from whatever source they came,&mdash;found a
welcome here.</p>

<p>All, did I say? I am not quite so sure of that; for
there was one, a motherless girl, who had journeyed
from the hills of old Massachusetts to find a home in
this Western city, who gave the good people thereof a

<!-- page 79 -->

great deal of uneasiness. There was nothing formidable
in her appearance. Her mild blue eye gave no indication
of evil: still, they were troubled at her presence,
watched her closely, and said many things of her that
had no foundation in truth.</p>

<p>Church-people asserted that she was in league with
the Devil, or rather under his control; others that she
was insane, or fast becoming so; still others, that she
was a cheat, a sort of juggler, a hypocrite, one who pretended
that which was not, or which had no other
origin than her own cunning: in fact, the whole city
was moved by the presence of this one feeble woman,
and questioned one with another as to the result of her
coming.</p>

<p>But what said she of herself? what was her testimony
in the case?</p>

<p>Why, that she was a mediator, or medium of communication
between the two worlds,&mdash;the physical and
the spiritual; that those who once lived upon the earth,
but are now in the world of spirits,&mdash;that such could
control her person, take possession of her organs of
speech, and talk with those who were still in the
flesh.</p>

<p>Such was her claim; and such is the hunger of the
masses for some knowledge of the great hereafter, for
some word from the&mdash;to them&mdash;silent ones, that the
anathemas of the church, the cry of Devil, the charge
of insanity, nor the laugh of derision, often the most
potent of all, could keep her rooms from being
thronged. The Nicodemuses came by night; while
sad, sinning, sorrowing ones&mdash;those who had little of
the world's favor to lose&mdash;came boldly and at all hours;

<!-- page 80 -->

and, like the Nazarene of old, she received them all.
And like him, too, she was scandalized for so doing.</p>

<p>Those who came by night were generally from the
churches. At one time it would be the minister, who,
sitting with closed doors, would apologize for the secrecy
desired, by saying, "I am willing to investigate this
subject, but do not wish to lose my influence over my
people; and the masses are so easily prejudiced." The
next evening, perhaps, or at some hour when they
thought they would not be seen, some of the members
would make their way thither with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We want to understand this matter for ourselves;
but don't say any thing about it, for I don't know what
our minister would think."</p>

<p>But of the many <i>s&eacute;ances</i> held, and the many convincing
tests given of the reality of spirit presence, we
will look in upon, and make public, the occurrences of
but one evening. It is a select circle of six that have
met. They have sat together from time to time, till the
conditions of harmony have been established; and, by
the especial request of the controlling spirit, some two
or three strangers have been admitted to the room.
Amongst these is an old man of perhaps sixty years of
age, who had come into the place that very day, and
was stopping at the house where the circle was held;
and another, who had been in the city only a week, and
might have been five or six years younger. Of the
first, those present knew absolutely nothing, but that he
had given his name as Waldo. The second one had
given a false name on purpose, as he said, to test the
matter.</p>

<p>There was still a third, a young man; but with him

<!-- page 81 -->

they were slightly acquainted. These were not in the
circle, but only in the room. The circle was formed;
the medium was controlled; and the very first movement
she made was to rise from the table, take the
attitude of a half-drunken bar-room bully, and pour
forth a volume of oaths.</p>

<p>The members of the circle were astonished, for they
had seen nothing of this kind before; while the strangers
could hardly restrain their feelings of contempt;
and he who had given a false name was heard to
whisper, "That is the devil, I know."</p>

<p>And, indeed, it did look hard to hear the big oath
coming from these lovely lips; but presently there was
a change. The medium approached the gentleman
who had given his name as Waldo, seeming desirous to
speak to him, but afraid to do so; while the look was no
longer bold and defiant, but that of a humble suppliant.</p>

<p>There was such an evident shrinking, that a member
of the circle said, "You need not be afraid of that gentleman:
speak to him if you wish."</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, the following conversation was held
between the controlling spirit and the aged stranger:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you recollect keeping a public house in Cherry
Green some years since, Mr. Waldo?"</p>

<p>"I do," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Do you remember a young man by the name of
James Jordan, who used to visit your bar, and drink,
not to drunkenness, but till so boisterous that you had
to put him out?"</p>

<p>"I remember it well," said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"Do you remember that your barns were burned
shortly after, and you never knew who did it?"</p>

<!-- page 82 -->

<p>"Certainly I do: that fire so nearly broke me up,
that I have not recovered from its effects yet."</p>

<p>"Well, I am that young man," was continued, in
tones of deep contrition: "I burned your barns. I have
been in the spirit-world four years, and have been looking
constantly for some means of reaching you, in order
to confess my wrong-doing, and beg your forgiveness;
for I can not get away from earth and earth-scenes,
could not progress one step, till I had done so."</p>

<p>Deep solemnity had by this time taken the place of
other feelings in the circle: while he who had sneered
turned pale, even to the lips; for his most secret thought
was, "If they can come and confess their own sins, they
can, if they choose, point out ours;" and, as if in response
to these thoughts, the medium turned directly
toward him, and said, "Yes, they can."</p>

<p>There was silence for a few moments; and then one
of the circle said, "Compensation, compensation: as
far as the condition of things make it possible, such
seems to be the order of the universe, if ever did I see
such force in the words of Jesus, 'If thou bringest thy
gift to the altar, and rememberest that thy brother hath
aught against thee, go thy way, first be reconciled to
thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.' Never
did I see such force in them as now. They seem to
hold good of both worlds."</p>

<p>"But why," asked another, "was it necessary that
the manifestation should commence as it did? Why
those oaths?"</p>

<p>"We think there are various reasons for this; but
we will question the spirit on this subject. James, can
you tell us why this is?" said the leader of the circle.</p>

<!-- page 83 -->

<p>"I will try, sir. Did you never get to thinking so
intently upon some exciting scene in your past life, that
you seemed really to live it all over, even to the
minutest incident?"</p>

<p>"I certainly have; and I think that most people have
experienced the same," was the response.</p>

<p>"Do you not know, also, that those persons who can
enter most fully into the feelings of those they represent
make the best actors?"</p>

<p>"True, true," was uttered simultaneously by some
three or four.</p>

<p>"Well," continued the spirit," the difference between
us and actors is this: they act out the feelings of another
through their own bodies; we act out our feelings through
the body of another. Now, it is a difficult matter for
one to act through the body of another, as you can
readily imagine; and, to communicate what we wish, it
becomes necessary that we go back and live over those
scenes so thoroughly that we can send the same sensations
through the body of the medium; and, further, we
are the more readily recognized by acting our own
selves than by simple statements."</p>

<p>"That is true, as far as identity is concerned," said
Mr. Waldo: "for another, who knew of the facts, might
have made the same statement, and claimed to be the
same person; but it would take an accomplished actor to
personate James Jordan as thoroughly as did the medium
when she was first controlled."</p>

<p>"I thought you had not progressed, James," said another
of the circle: "it seems to me that you must have
learned considerable, to be able to explain this subject
to us as you have."</p>

<!-- page 84 -->

<p>"I said I could not progress till I had made all the
reparation in my power: neither could I, in the common
acceptation of the term; but, in order to communicate,
I must learn to control for myself or have assistance.
Now, my organization, my relation to the one wronged,
and other conditions that I can not now explain, made
it necessary for my best good that I should not have
help: consequently I had to learn the law of control;
and, having learned, can tell, as it was a characteristic
of mine, that of being able to tell what I knew."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Mr. Waldo; "for it was a common
saying, that Jim Jordan could tell all he knew,
and more too."</p>

<p>"But I can not, in this case, see the force of the argument,
that acting out his old character was better proof
of his identity than his simple statement would have
been; for who would be likely to confess to wrongs that
he never did?" said the one who had given a false
name.</p>

<p>"I would," said a voice that was the very expression
of duplicity and meanness. All turned to look at the
medium, and were surprised at the transformation. She
had taken a seat, and was pegging away as if her life
depended upon the immediate finishing of the work in
hand, while her features were those of a little weazen-faced
old man.</p>

<p>The young man, who was not a member of the circle,
had not spoken until now; but, upon hearing this, he
laughed aloud, and then asked, "Why would you do
that, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Because I should like to fool the people. But who
is it that calls me Bob? I would have you know, sir,

<!-- page 85 -->

that I am Roger Sherman, the most famous shoemaker
that ever lived in this country."</p>

<p>"You are unfortunate, then, in your attempts to make
yourself known: for I say that you are Robert Perigrene,
my father's cousin, commonly called Bob; and,
when here, you were such a liar, that 'Lies as bad as
Bob Perigrene,' was a common saying in the neighborhood;
but what brought you here to-night?"</p>

<p>"That man," was the reply, as the finger of the medium
pointed toward the stranger with a false name. "I
like good company, and thought I had a right to tell a
lie as well as he."</p>

<p>The stranger turned very red in the face. "I will
own," said he, "that I have not given my true name:
still, I have seen nothing here to-night that is convincing
to me; for I do not know but there may be collusion. If
they will tell me my true name, I will believe."</p>

<p>"No, you wouldn't," said Bob, in his own peculiar
tones; "but there is one here who says he will tell you
when the lady comes."</p>

<p>"What lady?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; but she will come."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that, either; but I don't like this uniform,
and I must leave."</p>

<p>"Why do you not like it?"</p>

<p>"Because it is hard work to tell a lie in it: it wasn't
made for such as me, and the truth will come out when
I have it on. Good-by. If you want any shoes made,
call on me, and they will certainly be done at the time
promised; for I never disappoint a customer."</p>

<p>This last caused a general laugh, while the influence

<!-- page 86 -->

changed again. This time there was nothing said; but
the medium seized a pencil and wrote,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come here again when you return.&mdash;M. S." And
handed it to the one who had asked for his true name.</p>

<p>"And who is M. S.?" asked he, when he had read
it.</p>

<p>Again the pencil was taken; and it was written, "You
will know in good time." He seemed about to question
further; but, at the moment, a change went over his
countenance, as though&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">Memory's cords were swept by hands unseen,&mdash;<br/>

By hands that rudely tore aside the vail<br/>

Which covered the forgotten past,&mdash;<br/>

By him forgotten: God remembers all.</p>

<p>The influence now left the medium; and the circle
was closed till the time appointed for another meeting.</p>

<p>The stranger last referred to left the next day to go
still farther west: was absent for several months; but,
when he returned, he again sought the circle. What
then occurred is reserved for a future chapter.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="small">A RIFT IN THE CLOUD.</p>

</div>

<p>HAVE you not seen, when the thunder
had sped its bolt, the storm roll back from
one side of the heavens, letting in the
sunshine to build a rainbow bridge upon
which hope could travel from one end of
the earth to the other?</p>

<p>And thus it was with Alice for a few months after
the death of her father. True, the storm was not past;
pearly drops fell plentifully and often: but the beautiful
reflection of as true a love as ever warmed the human
heart arched the blackness that was past, and hope
promised brightly for the future.</p>

<p>We find, however, that, in the physical world, sunshine
and rain together indicate another storm, and
that not far away; but we must not anticipate.</p>

<p>In a preceding chapter, we left Alice beside her
father's corpse. Let us enter more minutely into the
particulars of that sorrowful hour, that we may thus,
one by one, trace the links that connected her life with
the future.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vale was nearly frantic when she found that
her husband was really dead. The temporary strength
that had caused her self-assertion forsook her entirely,
and she reproached herself most bitterly for the part
she had acted.</p>

<!-- page 88 -->

<p>"Oh! why," she moaned, "did I not suffer on in silence?
It was not his fault that I married him, not
loving him. I wronged him cruelly in so doing; and I
deserved to suffer."</p>

<p>Alice was, as usual, self-possessed: still, her heart
sank within her when she looked upon the result of
her perseverance, of her assertion of her own personal
rights; but what she thus gathered of her mother's
heart-history through the broken and half-incoherent
sentences uttered in that hour of anguish made her
feel that it was better, even thus, than that she had
sacrificed herself and wronged another by entering into
the holiest of life's relations in such a manner as would
have made her whole life a living lie.</p>

<p>It was found, upon the examination of Mr. Vale's
business affairs, that he was insolvent, or so nearly so
that it would take every thing there was to meet the
obligations against him. This was doubtless one reason
why he was so intent upon a wealthy marriage for Alice.
It was his last hope,&mdash;his <i>left bower;</i> and, when she
covered it with the <i>right</i> one of her own personal independence,
the game was lost, and it was more than he
could endure.</p>

<p>It was a sad thought to the affectionate but firm-hearted
daughter, but still more sad to witness the condition
to which his sudden death had brought her
mother; for living trouble is harder to be borne than
that which death has placed beyond our reach.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vale was so completely broken down, so under
the dominion of self-reproach, that it required all of
Alice's tact and self-possession to keep that last scene
in the room when Mr. Vale fell from being made public.

<!-- page 89 -->

John Shepherd, as the husband of Alice, as a
matter of course, took charge of affairs; and, when all
was settled, it was found that there was very little, except
his own salary as a clerk, for the support of both
Alice and her mother.</p>

<p>This troubled him: not on his own account; but he
feared, that, with the mother also to care for, he should
not be able to make both as comfortable as he would like.
But Alice smilingly said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Poverty is not the worst thing in the world, John.
'Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled
ox and hatred therewith.' If mother can have what she
needs, I shall not care for myself."</p>

<p>"Bless you, my own dear wife!" he replied; "but
when I think of the wealth that would have been yours
had you married Sawtelle, I"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You wish I had married him," said Alice mischievously.</p>

<p>"No, no, not that; for what would my life have been
without you! But surely I were a wretch, did I not
feel that I could never sufficiently prize the love that
chose poverty with me to wealth with him."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, John: don't go to getting up any heroics
now. I am sure there was no great credit in taking
that which I preferred when I had my choice," she
replied, in a tone of deprecation that was perfectly enchanting
to the young husband; and, catching her to his
heart, he exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"God do so to me, and more also, my darling wife,
if I ever prove otherwise than a kind and faithful husband
to you!"</p>

<p>Edward Winchester and Addie stood their firm friends

<!-- page 90 -->

in this their hour of trial; and, after due deliberation, it
was decided that it would be better for them to leave the
place connected with such unpleasant associations, and
start anew elsewhere.</p>

<p>Winchester had friends living in the village of Batesville,
some fifty miles distant; and through his influence
a clerkship was secured for Shepherd in the largest
store there, and at a better salary than he was getting
at Brown's. In a few weeks, they were established in
their new home, where Mrs. Vale, under the influence
of new surroundings and new cares, became comparatively
cheerful, while Alice, but for the too recent sad
memories, would have been as blithe as a bird.</p>

<p>An intimate friend of Shepherd's had taken his old
place; and, from the correspondence held with him and
the Winchesters, they were kept well informed as to
what was going on in Ellsville. Things prospered with
them in their new home. Alice, by economy and industry,
added to their weekly gains; and, as the past slipped
farther away, the present continued to grow brighter,
till at length the dark cloud lay only on the confines of
the horizon,&mdash;not even high enough for a background
to the rainbow that was no longer needed.</p>

<p>But how often have we seen a storm, that had spent
but a portion of its fury, pass on, only to return with
redoubled violence; and thus it was in their case. The
dark cloud that "Crazy Pete" had told Alice of so
long before had cast only a portion of its shadow upon
her spirit: the depth of its blackness was yet to come.</p>

<p>The first indication she received that the "indignation"
was not past was in the steady failure of her
mother's health. Mrs. Vale's nervous system had received

<!-- page 91 -->

such a shock that it could not recover its tone
again. True, there was a temporary rally during the
excitement consequent upon changing her residence,
going among new scenes, making new acquaintances,
&amp;c.; but, this over, there came the reaction. It was so
gradual, however, that Alice for a long time did not
notice it; and, when she did, she would fain believe that
it was nothing serious,&mdash;nothing but what medicine and
tender care would relieve; but, when the doctor was
spoken of to the invalid, she utterly refused to see
him.</p>

<p>"It will do no good," she said: "he can not minister
to a mind diseased."</p>

<p>"O mother!" said Alice, "why will you talk thus?
You were not to blame; and the past can not be remedied."</p>

<p>"I was more to blame, my child, than you think. It
is the last drop that makes the cup overflow; and, in
my love for you, I forgot that he, too, had claims upon
me. I know that he was doing wrong: but he was excited
and bitterly disappointed; and what right had I, at
such a time above all others, to tell him that I had perjured
myself at the altar,&mdash;had given him my hand
without my heart?"</p>

<p>"But you were excited, too, mother: why not make
some allowance for yourself for doing wrong under
excitement, as well as for others?"</p>

<p>"But mine was a life-long wrong, carefully concealed
till the time that he could least bear it. O Alice! your
father was not to blame in this: he did not know that
he had wedded an unwilling bride. If I had only
been firm, had been true to myself, he might have found

<!-- page 92 -->

one who did love him, and have been happy with her
now."</p>

<p>"You are sick, dear mother, and your fancies are
morbid: put such thoughts away from you, and all will
yet be well." Mrs. Vale shook her head, but made no
further reply; and from this time forth she sank rapidly.</p>

<p>About a week after this, Alice said to her husband
one night, after her mother had retired, "I think, John,
that we had better call the doctor for mother, even if
she is not willing; for she is failing so fast I fear that
we shall not keep her long unless something can be
done for her."</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly, wife: I should have called one
before now had the matter rested with me."</p>

<p>"Then stop on your way to the store in the morning,
and request Dr. Wilson to step in some time in the
course of the day," said Alice, in conclusion; and then
other subjects of conversation were introduced.</p>

<p>Upon retiring for the night, she went, as usual, to her
mother's room to see if any thing was needed. Upon
speaking to her, however, she received no reply. As
she lay with her face turned away, Alice thought that
she was asleep; and, not liking to wake her, left without
further effort at getting a response. In the morning she
went again to her room; but, upon opening the door, she
found that her mother was lying exactly as she was the
evening previous. With trembling steps, and a terrible
fear at her heart, she went to the bedside to find but the
cold form from which the spirit had fled.</p>

<p>She had evidently been dead for several hours: her
cheek rested upon her right hand, and a pleasant smile
showed that there had been no struggle.</p>

<!-- page 93 -->

<p>I will not attempt to portray the grief of Alice at the
loss of this, her only remaining parent.</p>

<p>"O John! I have no one but you now," said she,
as she lay sobbing upon his breast; and he only kissed
her in reply, for his heart was too full for speech.</p>

<p>They took the body back to Ellsville, and laid it beside
that of her husband. As they were passing Brown's
store, Holten, the clerk before spoken of, was standing
in the door, and remarked to some one within, and loud
enough for Alice to hear,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Alice has had her own way, and has killed
both of her parents by the means." It was too much
for the stricken one; and she fainted. Shepherd made
no remark at the time, but called upon Holten before
leaving the place, and, referring to the circumstance,
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You will see the day, sir, that you will be sorry for
that remark."</p>

<p>Holten smiled maliciously, and asked, "When you
are inside the walls of a prison?"</p>

<p>"You are too contemptible for chastisement," said
Shepherd, as he walked away.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that, Holten?" asked the
clerk who had taken Shepherd's place in the store.</p>

<p>"That is my business," was the curt reply; and,
taking his hat, he left the store. Brown, the merchant,
came in soon after, when Taylor, the clerk before
spoken of, asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is the matter with Holten, that he is so spiteful
toward Shepherd and his wife?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, unless he wanted Alice himself," replied
Brown.</p>

<!-- page 94 -->

<p>"That may be," said Taylor smiling, and made no
further remark: but he did not forget; for, taken in connection
with some events that had already transpired,
but which we have not as yet related, he feared that
there was trouble ahead.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p class="small">MIDNIGHT BLACKNESS.</p>

<p class="small">"The night cometh, and also the morning."</p>

</div>

<p>THEY called you crazy, Peter, because you
saw too much, because your spiritual eyes
were open; but did the cloud that you
beheld in the distant horizon of your
playmate and companion fling no shadow
upon your spirit? Or was it the shadow
that was cast upon you from before birth which gave
you clearer vision to penetrate the future?</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the cloud grows blacker, and the
midnight deepens over the pathway of our Alice. Kind
spirits of love, are you watching? will you sustain her
when the surges of the tempest would flood her soul?</p>

<p>Cheerful, yet saddened, the bereaved ones went back
to their lonely home, and again adjusted themselves to
the tasks of duty and of love. Each was all to the other
now, for Mr. Shepherd had been an orphan from boyhood;
and each strove, with love's purest intent, to fill
the needs of the other's being.</p>

<p>A lonely day had given place to the softened glory
of the brightest of nights; the duties of the evening
were done; John Shepherd and his wife were sitting
together, talking of the past and planning for the future,
when a rap at the door indicated that others were
near.</p>

<!-- page 96 -->

<p>"I wonder who it can be at this hour," said Alice,
while John went forward to ascertain. Upon looking
out, he saw three men, strangers, standing together upon
the step.</p>

<p>"What is wanted, gentlemen?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Are you John Shepherd, formerly clerk in E. P.
Brown's store in Ellsville?" said one of the party; and,
as he did so, he made a step forward, when Shepherd
saw that he wore an officer's insignia.</p>

<p>"I am," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Then, sir, you are my prisoner," said he, placing
one hand upon John's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Prisoner!"</p>

<p>"Yes: will you go with me peaceably?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, but upon what charge am I arrested?"</p>

<p>"Upon the charge of embezzling from your employer,
in person while there, and since then through the aid
of, and in conjunction with, Robert Taylor, who took
your place when you left, and who is now under
arrest."</p>

<p>"When, and by whom, was this charge first concocted?"
asked Shepherd indignantly.</p>

<p>"Young man, I can not stop to argue with you," said
the sheriff: "it is my business to take you back to Ellsville.
You will there be tried, and, if innocent, will
most likely be able to make it appear. Will you go
with us quietly, or shall we have to use force?"</p>

<p>"I have told you already what I would do, and I see
no cause for insult, sir; but will you walk in, gentlemen,
while I get my hat and overcoat, and speak a word
with my wife. O God! how can I tell her?" he groaned
inwardly.</p>

<!-- page 97 -->

<p>But of this last there was no need, for Alice had
heard every word.</p>

<p>With firm tones, though blanched cheek, she now
stepped forward.</p>

<p>"You will take me too?" she said.</p>

<p>"We can not, madam: we have orders for only your
husband."</p>

<p>"Orders that you shall permit no one to accompany
him?" she questioned.</p>

<p>"Not exactly that," was the reply; "but a press of
other business makes it necessary that we should ride
all night. And, besides, we have no comfortable conveyance
for a lady, and no room in it if we had: there are
seats but for four."</p>

<p>"Enough," she replied. "I see that you do not want
me along; but my place is beside my husband, and I
shall go." And, whispering a word in John's ear, she
threw a shawl over her shoulders, and started for the
street.</p>

<p>"Don't go to-night, Alice," he said: "wait till morning,
and I will not object."</p>

<p>"I shall go to-night," was her firm response. "Do
you think I could stay here quietly till morning, and
live?" And, hurrying quickly forward, she soon reached
the only livery-stable in town. The keeper was just
about to close it for the night, when she accosted him
with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Jennings, for the love of Heaven, furnish me a
horse, buggy, and driver, to go to Ellsville with, as soon
as possible; and here is my watch and chain to secure
you for the payment till I return."</p>

<p>"What in the world is the matter, Mrs. Shepherd?

<!-- page 98 -->

is anybody dead or dying?" asked the man in astonishment.</p>

<p>"No: but be quick; for there will be if they take
away my husband, and I can't go too."</p>

<p>Jennings looked into her face, and, seeing the terrible
earnestness depicted there, called to the boy to harness
as quick as possible, while he questioned further,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What are they taking your husband away for?"</p>

<p>"Upon the charge of robbing his former employer;
but, for Heaven's sake, don't detain me a moment!
Send the horse around to our gate as soon as possible,
and I will go and get ready." And away she went with
the speed of a deer, reaching her own home just as the
sheriff and his posse were about to start.</p>

<p>"I shall be right after you, John," said she, kissing
her hand to him. "Keep up good courage; for, if there
is such a thing in the world as justice, you will soon be
free."</p>

<p>They had not gone more than two miles when Alice
overtook them; and, after that, she kept close behind
them the most of the way. Notwithstanding their
haste, with bad roads, and stopping a few hours for rest,
they did not reach Ellsville till toward evening of the
next day. When they were within six or seven miles
of town, Alice drove ahead, and had the Winchesters
apprised of what was going on. As she passed the store,
Holten saw her, and seemed much surprised; but, as
her clear, full eye met his, his countenance fell, and,
with a muttered curse, he turned away.</p>

<p>It will be necessary, here, to go back a little, and explain
some of the causes that led to this arrest; and, to
do so fully, we must give something of Holten's history
ere he came to Ellsville.</p>

<!-- page 99 -->

<p>He was the illegitimate child of a gentleman of leisure,
who lived by his wits, and inherited both the expertness
and duplicity of his father. He had lived in
the city till he was twenty-one years of age, and in that
time had acquired just that kind of education that Christian
cities furnish for their outcast sons. He had often
been caught in petty scrapes, and as often suspected of
more grave offenses, but always managed to escape any
serious punishment. But at length, becoming more
bold in crime, he essayed his hand at forgery, and came
so near being caught, that he resolved to quit for ever
the scene of his old haunts, seek some retired place, and
see what fortune would do for him in the way of his
earning an honest living.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this resolution, he had come to the
little village of Ellsville, some three years previous, and
taken up his abode there. He had enough of his ill-gotten
gains left to support him, till, by his suavity of
address, pleasing manners, and a well-concocted account
of his previous life, he secured the position of clerk in
the store of E. P. Brown, who was the largest merchant
and one of the most influential men in all that region of
country.</p>

<p>This situation secured, and all was clear before him;
at least, so he thought: but there is no condition in life
for either man or woman, in which they will not be
<i>tried</i>; and that is not virtue which does not stand the
test. All went well with him till he saw Alice Vale;
but, from that moment, his bosom was torn with a feeling
to which he had hitherto been a stranger. To become
acquainted with and win her for his wife was now
the sole thought that occupied his mind; but, when he

<!-- page 100 -->

found that his fellow-clerk was the favored one, hatred
took possession of his soul, and from that hour he resolved
to accomplish the ruin of John Shepherd.</p>

<p>He had learned the relation in which John and Alice
stood to each other before he had made his own feelings
known; and he understood human nature too well to
think for a moment that one like Alice could be won
from her allegiance. There was no hope for him, only
in vengeance upon the innocent rival who had won her
heart before he had had the opportunity of doing so.</p>

<p>The pure instincts of Alice's soul would have prevented
his success, even had her affections been unengaged;
but this he could not know. He had not, as
yet, learned that there were those from whom he could
not be hidden, let him cover himself ever so deeply.</p>

<p>Resolved on the wrong, there was not long wanting
the occasion. The incident of the note suggested the
first step in his afterward matured plan for success;
and, from that time forth until he left the store, William
Holten hovered, like the shadow of the imp of darkness,
over every movement of John Shepherd's.</p>

<p>From the getting possession of that first note, and
finding those few legible words thereon, he had commenced
a system of embezzlement from the money-drawer,
resolving, when the right moment arrived, to
fasten suspicion upon Shepherd, and use this, in connection
with whatever else he could gather, toward insuring
his conviction.</p>

<p>The sums taken were at first small and infrequent,
but so planned, that, suspicion once aroused, they could
be readily discovered. These sums were gradually increased,
both in size and frequency, as though the perpetrator,

<!-- page 101 -->

in the absence of discovery, was growing bolder
in crime.</p>

<p>When John and Alice were married, and left the
place, this at first disconcerted, but upon further thought
really facilitated, Holten's plans: for he had only to make
it appear that Taylor was an associate, and that it was
he who had written the notes that had enjoined care for
fear of discovery; and, for this purpose, he took to
copying Taylor's handwriting.</p>

<p>He was naturally good at imitating; and it was not
long till he had succeeded so perfectly, that Taylor himself
would not have suspected the difference, had something
that he had really written been presented to him
after it had been copied by Holten. This done, he next
took those remnants of notes, and, by careful efforts,
succeeded, at length, in substituting others in their place,
so chewed and burned that the difference could not have
been told between them and the originals, only that the
legible words in the copies were in the handwriting of
Taylor, instead of the feminine one belonging to Alice.</p>

<p>Beside, as is always the case, there were many little
incidents, nothing in themselves, but weights when put
into the balance of suspicion. And, added to all, was
a note of his own preparing, kept to be left, as if by
accident, where Brown would be certain to find it when
the right time came for putting his plans into execution.
Upon these forged links, so connected with the accidental
ones as to present one unbroken chain, did Holten depend
for the success of his Satanic scheme.</p>

<p>The chain was complete, all but the hook; and the
visit of the Shepherds to Ellsville at the time of the
funeral of Alice's mother furnished the occasion for

<!-- page 102 -->

forging that. Holten, as soon as he knew of their presence
in town, took an unusually large sum from the
drawer, and was the first to miss and draw Brown's
attention to it. Brown had been in once that morning,
and gone out again; and, upon his return, Holten
asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Brown, have you taken a sum of money from
the drawer this morning?"</p>

<p>"I have not: why?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, only there is some missing; but perhaps
Taylor knows where it is."</p>

<p>"Where is Taylor?"</p>

<p>"He went out a few minutes ago with Shepherd."</p>

<p>"Yes: I heard that Shepherd was in town," said
Brown, and then added, "I presume Taylor has paid
out the money, for there were some small bills due
to-day."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has," was Holten's reply. "He could
have done so without my noticing it, for I have been
very busy."</p>

<p>Taylor returned in about half an hour; and, soon
after, the bills that Brown had spoken of were presented
for payment.</p>

<p>"How is this, Taylor?" said his employer: "I supposed
that these were paid?"</p>

<p>"What made you think they were paid?" asked
Taylor.</p>

<p>"Why, Holten said that there was some money gone
from the drawer; and we concluded that you had paid
it out."</p>

<p>"No: I have paid out no money. I have had no
occasion to pay out any," said Taylor, looking a little
surprised.</p>

<!-- page 103 -->

<p>"I must look into this: how much is there missing,
Holten?" said the merchant with a look of anxiety
upon his face.</p>

<p>"Fifty dollars. Smith paid it in last night just
before we closed."</p>

<p>"Are you certain that you did not put it in some
other place?"</p>

<p>"I am. Taylor saw him pay it to me, and saw where
I put it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Taylor: "I remember it the more particularly,
as he paid me fifty at the same time; and I
noticed that the bills were of the same denomination,
and upon the same bank, as those paid to Holten."</p>

<p>"Was he owing you?" asked Brown.</p>

<p>"Yes, for money borrowed three months ago."</p>

<p>"I fear we have a thief amongst us," said the merchant:
"did you take the numbers of the bills,
Holten?"</p>

<p>"I did: I have been in the habit of doing so when
any bill as high as five dollars was paid in, ever since
there has been so much counterfeit money afloat."</p>

<p>"That is well: perhaps we may be able to trace
them, and catch the rogue."</p>

<p>"I hope so," said Taylor; "for, if there is any thing
that I despise, it is a thief."</p>

<p>"And so do I," said Holten, "Still, when I think of
the suffering thus caused to friends and relatives, I
almost wish that the guilty could escape for the sake of
the innocent."</p>

<p>"A sentiment very creditable to the heart; but it will
not do for the head in the present state of society," said
Brown, as he took the number, date, and denomination

<!-- page 104 -->

of the bills in question, from Holten's memorandum,
preparatory to going out for the purpose of instituting
measures that should lead to the detention of the guilty
party.</p>

<p>Holten had noticed the evening previous, that, with
the exception of dates and numbers, the bills paid to
Taylor were the same as those paid to him for Brown,
and had said to himself, "Here is just the trap I need,
if I can only set and spring it aright." It was his intention
to get hold of Taylor's pocket-book, and, taking
his, substitute the ones of which he had taken the numbers
and dates; but, as yet, he had had no opportunity.</p>

<p>He had accomplished enough that morning, however,
to make him think it safe to speak to his employer; for
when Shepherd came in, and asked Taylor to give him
two fives and a ten for a twenty, after the change had
been made, he had said, "Let me look at those bills,
Shepherd."</p>

<p>Taking them in his hand, and examining them a
moment, he looked at Taylor with, "Those that Smith
paid you last night?"</p>

<p>"The same," said Taylor.</p>

<p>"They are upon the same bank that those were he
paid me," remarked Holten carelessly, handing back,
as the other supposed, the same money. But, in the
mean time, it had been changed; and, all unconscious
of wrong, Shepherd carried away three of the missing
bills. The next night, Holten succeeded in getting hold
of Taylor's pocket-book, and the balance of the exchange
was made.</p>

<p>Shepherd had paid out a portion of his&mdash;a ten and
a five&mdash;to Winchester. Indeed, it was for this very

<!-- page 105 -->

purpose that he had had his larger bill broken; and,
the morning after he left, Taylor paid out ten dollars of
that which was in his possession to a farmer from the
country. He took it home, and paid it to a neighbor;
and that neighbor came back the very next day, and paid
it into Brown's own hands. This, being traced up, led
to the arrest of Taylor; and Winchester, the morning
after paying out that which he had received from Shepherd
into the hands of one of the parties that Brown had
set upon the watch, caused his suspicion to be turned
in that direction; but Holten said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I can't believe it possible, Mr. Brown, that Shepherd
is guilty. I saw Taylor pay him some money, and
I think this must be a portion of it:" at the same time,
however, he managed that the letter he had so artfully
concocted should fall into Brown's hands.</p>

<p>"Somebody has lost a letter," said the merchant,
picking it up from the end of the step at the front door
of the store, where it lay with pieces of loose paper, and
all seemed to have fallen there as if by accident.</p>

<p>Holten looked up. "Is it sealed?" he asked, at the
same time putting his hand to his own pocket, as though
he feared that it was his.</p>

<p>Brown laughed aloud. "Been writing a love-letter,"
said he, "and was afraid you had lost it?" And then,
looking at the letter in his hand, he continued, "Yes:
it is sealed, and directed to John Shepherd; but it has
not been mailed, and, as I live, it is Taylor's handwriting.
I must see what is in this!"</p>

<p>The result of the reading of that letter was the
arrest of Shepherd. That evening Holten said, "Had
we not better look over the books, Mr. Brown: perhaps

<!-- page 106 -->

this thing has been going on longer than we
think."</p>

<p>The merchant readily consented; and Holten, giving
him the clew so cunningly that he never suspected but
that he had discovered it himself, he traced it back to
the very first petty sum taken. The next morning
Holten made up a bundle of his old clothes, and desired
the errand-boy of the store to take them to a poor
woman up town, handing him a dime to pay him for
his trouble.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," said he, as the boy was about to
start: "I believe I have not looked in all of the pockets;
and, taking them from the boy's hand, he looked them
over one after another. "There is nothing," said he;
"but I always like to be certain," turning towards Brown
as he spoke, as though half excusing himself for being so
particular. He was about to relinquish the bundle into
the hands of the boy again, when he drew it back with,
"Hold&mdash;here is a pocket I had not seen; and, thrusting
his hand into it, he drew forth the copied remnants of
the notes that Alice had sent to John more than a year
before. Glancing at them, he laughed, and said, "The
fragments of those notes,&mdash;I had forgotten all about
them."</p>

<p>"What notes?" asked Brown.</p>

<p>"Don't you recollect the time we had with Shepherd,
when he coughed, and threw that piece of paper from
his mouth; and I picked it up, telling him that he was
in a great strait if he could not get enough of his love-letters
without eating them; and the other one is the
remnant of one that I saw him set on fire, and throw
down on the stove-hearth, a short time afterward."</p>

<!-- page 107 -->

<p>"How happened you to keep them?"</p>

<p>"To tease him about; but his speedy marriage and
old Vale's tragic death put an end to that."</p>

<p>"Let me see them, will you?"</p>

<p>Holten handed them to the merchant, with a countenance
as innocent as that of an angel. Surely, if ever
mortal stole "the livery of the court of heaven to serve
the Devil in," he had.</p>

<p>Brown looked at the scarred and mutilated remains a
moment, and then, turning to Holten, said, "More evidence."</p>

<p>"More evidence! how, sir?" said Holten, in a well-feigned
tone of surprise.</p>

<p>"Who do you suppose wrote this?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I do not know; but I always supposed it
was Alice, and that was why I wished to tease him."</p>

<p>"But why should she be so careful about discovery?"</p>

<p>"On account of her father's opposition. I tell you,
Mr. Brown, Mr. Vale would have stopped at nothing
that would have separated them; and Alice knew it,"
said Holton earnestly.</p>

<p>"But Alice never wrote this. Look at the handwriting,
and see if you don't know whose it is."</p>

<p>Holton took the papers from Brown's hand, and
looked at them carefully. "It is Taylor's," said he;
"but I had never thought of such a thing,"</p>

<p>"I wonder that you did not recognize it before,"</p>

<p>"You know, Mr. Brown, that I was not familiar with
Taylor's handwriting at the time; and I hardly looked
at them now before I gave them to you, sir."</p>

<p>"True," said Brown. "I had forgotten that Taylor did

<!-- page 108 -->

not come here till after Shepherd left; but it really
seems providential that these fragments should turn up
just at this time."</p>

<p>"Providential!" yes, in the same sense as that of the
ancient Jew, when he said, "Is there evil in the city,
and the Lord hath not done it?" Surely, it needs the
light of eternity to illuminate the dark places of this
life.</p>

<p>And thus the evidence accumulated. A portion of
the missing money was traced to those two men, and the
remainder was found upon their persons. Taylor and
Shepherd were fast friends; had long been known to be
such; and, when Shepherd left Brown's employ, it
was through his influence that Taylor had secured the
place.</p>

<p>The letter found had the appearance of being written
with the intention of sending it to Batesville by mail:
but it had not been mailed; and the supposition was,
that, upon Shepherd's coming to the place, Taylor had
handed it to him, and he had dropped it. This letter
was so written, that, in connection with other events,
it revealed what it seemed intended to conceal from all
but the parties themselves. A stranger could have understood
nothing from its contents.</p>

<p>And, lastly, these fragments. It seemed to the prisoners
at the bar, as they listened to all this testimony, that
the prince of darkness himself could not have concocted
a more thoroughly connected chain. They felt morally
sure that Holten was at the bottom of it; and yet there
was not a single circumstance by means of which they
could make others think so.</p>

<p>The evidence was so strong, that no one but Winchester

<!-- page 109 -->

and his wife doubted their guilt; and even they
hardly knew what to believe. Of course they were
convicted, and sentenced to prison. Words would be
useless in attempting to portray the agony of Alice;
still, she restrained every expression of it, further than
what her compressed and bloodless lips would betray:
for, with woman's instinct, she not only felt that this was
Holten's work, but she felt the why; and she determined
that he should not have the triumph of seeing any manifestation
of weakness on her part.</p>

<p>She kept up bravely also in the presence of her
husband. "He has enough to bear," she said to Addie
Winchester, "without my adding to his load." "There
will be a righting to this wrong sometime, my husband,"
were almost her last words, ere he started on his way
to Albany; "and we shall not be wholly separated, for
I shall follow you soon, shall stay in the vicinity, and see
you as often as possible."</p>

<p>"God bless you, my own sweet wife! it is my greatest
comfort that you believe me innocent," said he, speaking
as calmly as his emotion would permit.</p>

<p>"Not so great as the consciousness that you are so,"
she replied smiling.</p>

<p>"Your approval would not only be worthless, but
torture, without that: your innocent confidence would
be a greater reproach to me than even the crime itself."
And thus each sustained the other, with loving words
and noble sentiments, till the hour of parting came.
Alice then returned to her home, boxed up her bedding
and such other things as she could keep best, sent them
to Ellsville, to Winchester's, for safe-keeping, disposed
of whatever else there was to the best advantage she

<!-- page 110 -->

could, and putting the money on interest, all but a few
dollars for present need, she started for the city whose
limits held the gloomy prison-walls that had shut her
husband from the outer world; and here, for the present,
we will leave her.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p class="small">GOD'S ELECT.</p>

</div>

<p>ON the outskirts of the city of Albany lived
the Rev. Silas Dare. His family consisted
of his wife, two grown daughters, a son,
and three smaller children,&mdash;Susie, Jennie,
and bright-eyed, mischievous little
Eddie, aged respectively twelve, nine, and seven years.</p>

<p>Their home was a neat white cottage, very tastefully
adorned, and standing in the center of a plot of ground
laid off in walks, and filled with flowers and choice shrubbery,
the whole of which was so artistically planned, and
so well kept, that many a stranger, passing by other
places of greater pretensions, would stop to admire
this.</p>

<p>Mr. Dare, when he believed that at least half of the
poor creatures who were confined within prison walls
would finally become heirs of eternal torture,&mdash;objects
of God's vengeance for ever; when he believed and
taught the doctrines of election, reprobation, &amp;c.,&mdash;had
been chosen, year by year, to act as chaplain for the
prison; but now, when his ideas had become so enlarged
as to believe that God would eventually wipe the tears
from off all faces, the place was shut against him.</p>

<p>His organ of what phrenologists call human nature
was large. He studied men and things closely; and

<!-- page 112 -->

his long experience with those who are held in bonds as
criminals had convinced him that human justice is so
short-sighted, so mole-eyed, that the innocent are about
as often condemned as the guilty, and that, when otherwise,
it was more often from weakness, from the force of
circumstances, than from real wickedness, that the acts
were committed which incarcerated their unhappy victims.</p>

<p>Largely sympathetic, he came at last to pity more
than to blame even the worst offenders. The more
closely he observed, the less sympathy he had with those
lines of Young,&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"From all beings but himself<br/>

God hides that worst of sights,<br/>

A naked human heart,"&mdash;</p>

<p>till finally thus, step by step, he was led out of the great
darkness that had hung so like an incubus upon his
soul. He saw the way clear for all; and not only that,
but that all would at last find it. And, without a thought
of worldly policy, he boldly proclaimed that which gave
him so much joy; for, in the earnestness and honesty
of his own heart, he did not once imagine but that others
would rejoice with him.</p>

<p>Alas! he had not measured the strength of superstition
and prejudice: he little anticipated the storm
that was thus brought upon his devoted head. What
had he done, that he should be disfellowshiped, cast
out of the land of brotherhood where he had so long
been a faithful worker? What crime had he committed?
What moral law had he broken? None,&mdash;not
one; but he had had the audacity to think for himself,

<!-- page 113 -->

till so imbued with the spirit of Jesus, that he could say
from the heart, "Neither do I condemn thee: go and
sin no more;" and the angel of progress, seeing this evidence
of fitness, had touched his eyes with magnetic
fingers, causing him to see truths that they could not
see: therefore they thrust him out. And this was well.
It is a law of nature, that those who are in advance
should move on and prepare the way for the coming
multitude. But to Silas Dare it would have been quite
a serious affair, so far as a visible means of support was
concerned, had not a legacy of several thousands fallen
to his wife about this time.</p>

<p>The sun had set on a beautiful October day, and the
stars were shining as only stars can at that season of the
year, when a lady, simply but neatly attired, rang the
bell at the door of Mr. Dare's pleasant cottage. It was
opened by the tidy servant.</p>

<p>"Does the Rev. Silas Dare reside here?"</p>

<p>"He does."</p>

<p>"Will you please say that a lady would like to see
him."</p>

<p>"Any name?" asked the thoughtful servant.</p>

<p>"None: I am a stranger," was the reply; "but
stop: you may hand him this if you please," said she,
giving the servant what proved to be a letter of introduction.</p>

<p>"Very well: take a seat in the parlor, and I will inform
Mr. Dare."</p>

<p>The lady walked into the room indicated, took a
seat, and waited,&mdash;waited like one fully absorbed in
some painful subject; for, though several choice paintings
adorned the walls, and evidences of taste were upon

<!-- page 114 -->

all sides, she never once glanced at any of them, but sat
with her head resting upon one hand, and the other
pressed tightly over her heart. Presently, however, the
sound of footsteps aroused her to a sense of her present
condition. The door opened; and with quiet grace she
arose to her feet, as a benevolent-looking gentleman advanced
to meet her.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Shepherd, I am happy to meet you," said he,
frankly extending his hand. "I have long and favorably
known your friends the Winchesters. Indeed,
the old gentleman was a classmate of mine; and whoever
comes from them is sure of a welcome in my
house."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Alice, scarcely able to suppress
her emotions; for kindness more often touches the
fountain of tears than coldness or severity.</p>

<p>"Then one of those fine-looking fellows that was incarcerated
here a few days since was your husband,"
said Mr. Dare, thinking that the sooner the trial of
speaking of this was over the better; and then, without
waiting for a reply, he continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was at the prison, and saw them when they were
brought in; and I told Mrs. Dare, upon my return home,
that, if ever innocent men were shut up within those
walls, they were such."</p>

<p>"Oh! thank you, sir: you"&mdash;; but she could say
no more: the fountain of tears was completely broken
up, and she wept and sobbed like a child.</p>

<p>"Weep away," said the good man, while a suspicious
moisture gathered in his own eyes,&mdash;"weep away: it
will do you good. I will leave you to yourself a little,
till I prepare my wife and daughters for your acquaintance:

<!-- page 115 -->

in the mean time, take off your things; for you
will not leave us to-night, and, if I mistake not, for
many days to come. Your friends tell me that you wish
a situation where you can support yourself and be near
your husband; and we need some one very much just
now as governess for our three youngest children."</p>

<p>And thus did this man, who was considered no longer
good enough to teach those who were deemed neither
fit nor safe to mingle in society,&mdash;thus did he pour the
oil of consolation into this bruised and almost broken
heart; and thus did Alice find a home, friends, and the
tenderest sympathy, among strangers.</p>

<p>It was the custom of Mr. Dare to read a portion of
Scripture each morning, and afterward to invoke the
divine blessing upon himself and family. He had been
educated to this; had kept it up for many years; and
had, till recently, done so more from the force of habit
than any thing else. But, having perused several progressive
works of late, he was able to take a broader, a
more extensive view of things: so much so, that what
had once seemed to overshadow eternity, he now found
touched only upon points of time. The significance of
the present grew greater,&mdash;so much greater, that it
needed what he had once supposed referred only to a
future world to meet the demands and explain the phenomena
of to-day.</p>

<p>Under the influence of these awakened views, the
chapter read from morning to morning assumed a new
interest to him; the pages of the Bible gleamed with a
new light, which showed the darkness of the past, as well
as of the present,&mdash;the dark chambers of its inspired
minds, as dark where not illuminated as were the

<!-- page 116 -->

minds of those who made no such claims. Thus he
thought, not realizing that the light came from his own
soul,&mdash;that all things are dark to him whose eyes are
closed.</p>

<p>Some six weeks after Alice came there, the morning
lesson was the eighth chapter of Paul's Epistle to the
Romans: and, in the remarks made, the doctrine of election
very naturally came up for discussion.</p>

<p>"If these, and similar texts taken to prove the doctrine
of election, really referred to an eternal life beyond
the grave," said Mrs. Dare, "what thinking being
could look upon God as other than an infinite tyrant?"</p>

<p>"And still, wife, my observation goes to prove that
every generally, or even largely received opinion has
its foundation in truth; and, such being the case, what
think you, Mabel, is the real meaning of the term
'God's elect,' " said Mr. Dare, turning to his oldest
daughter.</p>

<p>"I think, father, that the term, as it is now understood,
has its foundation in man's ignorance," she replied.</p>

<p>"We are not speaking of the term as now understood,
my daughter, but of the law in nature, the reflection of
which has given rise to the idea."</p>

<p>"I think," said mild-eyed Maud, "that all are God's
elect, each for the place they can best fill; and the consciousness
of this truth shining brighter in some souls
than in others has led to the especializing of a universal
principle."</p>

<p>"Pretty well expressed, little Maud," said her father;
"but I hardly think it will cover the whole ground."</p>

<p>"Father," said Susie, "every one can not be president,

<!-- page 117 -->

or there were no private citizens, no government:
now, we elect our president, governor, and other officers
of state; but that does not prove that those who
are not elected are lost, cast out from the benefits of the
government. And why may not God thus elect certain
persons, or certain nations, to perform some important
part in the economy of his government, and still
hold all under his living care, as heirs to life eternal."</p>

<p>"Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings," murmured
the mother; while the father said, "The best
explanation I ever heard, Susie. William, have you
nothing to say upon this question?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking, father," said the young man, "of
the many examples we have of things that are alike
being chosen for different purposes, and the different
treatment to which they are subjected on that account.
Take, for instance, a field of wheat: from the sowing
to the harvesting,&mdash;yes, till after it is threshed, it is
treated as one; but, after that, look at the difference.
The largest portion is set apart for present use, but
the best portion as seed for a future harvest. Now,
that which is for present use could glory, were it conscious,
in ministering to our wants; in finding a place
upon our tables; resting upon china, perhaps as snowy
biscuits; eaten by the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the land in the form of
crust for the richly-made pie; or forming the substantial
part of the delicate bride's cake,&mdash;places of honor all;&mdash;while
that which has been selected for seed lies in
darkness and silence, decaying, dying, that its fruit may
appear in the future.</p>

<p>"Now, is it not thus in human life? Do not the
greater portion of the race meet and mingle upon the

<!-- page 118 -->

plane of the present,&mdash;some in high, and some in low
positions, even as flour from wheat is found in the poor
man's cot upon the wooden trencher, as well as upon
the millionaire's massive plate: and so of the human
masses; each ministering, as they have the power, to
the needs of the sphere in which they are found. But
there is still another class, few in number, and not appreciated
in the present, because their work is not for
the present.</p>

<p>"Now, it seems to me, that, if there is a class upon
earth who can justly be called God's elect, these are
the ones."</p>

<p>"A good illustration, my son," said Mr. Dare: "still,
no one view, no one illustration, can cover the entire
ground. Truth so pervades nature, that her shadow is
reflected from every point: but it is only the shadow;
and we, as reasoning beings, must trace them to their
source to find the substance. Mrs. Dare, will you not
give us something upon this question?"</p>

<p>"I will try; but I do not think I can improve upon
what the children have said. I shall go to the forest
for my illustration. We find a great variety of trees
here; and they can be put to a great variety of uses,&mdash;uses
that each shall fill in its own time. But the owner
desires to accomplish some especial object,&mdash;an object
in which some of this timber must bear a part; so he
goes through the forest, and elects, chooses, such trees
as will best suit his purpose, passing the others by.
Now, those that are chosen are not saved, nor the others
lost, in any true sense of that term."</p>

<p>"I think your illustration better than William's, wife,
from the fact that it can be carried out more fully. In

<!-- page 119 -->

the grinding, the bolting, or, to make the application,
the discipline, the suffering, come upon the wrong side."</p>

<p>"You think, then, that suffering in the present is the
portion of the elect?" said Alice, now speaking for the
first time.</p>

<p>"I believe that 'whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth,'
in the same sense that the man chasteneth the
tree he has chosen. He needs it for a purpose: he sees
within it that which will meet his need, but not in its
present condition. Choosing it from the rest, he may,
in a sense, be said to love it: still, the very next step is
the ponderous axe cleaving its side, blow after blow,
with no heed to its echoing groans, till it yields at last,
and comes to the earth with a crash."</p>

<p>"O papa!" said little Eddie, "if that is the way
God loves people, I don't want him to love me!"</p>

<p>The father smiled as he looked upon this, his youngest
darling. "Did you ever draw your sled to the top
of the hill for the sake of riding down upon it, my
son?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, papa, many a time: it is such fun."</p>

<p>"What, drawing the sled up the hill?"</p>

<p>"No, not that: I don't like that part; but the going
down again,&mdash;oh! it is so nice, and especially if the track
is long and smooth."</p>

<p>"The longer the track, the farther you have to walk
and draw your sled."</p>

<p>"Yes; but we don't mind that."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Why! Because we are thinking all the time of
the ride back, to be sure."</p>

<p>"Suppose that you did not know of the ride back;

<!-- page 120 -->

suppose the slide was upon the opposite side of the hill,
and you could not know of it till you reached the top:
what then?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, papa, I think the sled would draw rather
hard."</p>

<p>"Now, suppose the work to be done was ten, twenty,
or even fifty times as hard, and you were told that you
should be fully compensated, but how or when you could
not know."</p>

<p>"Papa, may I answer that?" said Jennie.</p>

<p>"Certainly, my child."</p>

<p>"We should have to believe, to walk by faith, or be
very miserable."</p>

<p>"What, then, does faith save us from, present or future
misery?"</p>

<p>"From present misery,&mdash;does it not?"</p>

<p>"It does, my child; and yet the most of people believe
that faith is necessary in order to [receive] salvation from
eternal misery: but the teachings of nature are, that
faith in the future is needed to secure, not future, but
present happiness."</p>

<p>"This office of faith is so very plain that I don't see
how any one can misunderstand it," said Mabel.</p>

<p>"Still, they do, as we have abundant evidence; but
have we not wandered from the subject? I should
like to have a more full application of these illustrations
to the question of God's elect," replied Maud.</p>

<p>"Suppose you make the application yourself," said
Mr. Dare.</p>

<p>"I would rather hear you, father; for I think, from
one remark you made, that you and I would agree: if
your ideas differ from mine, I will give mine afterward.
Please analyze William's first."</p>

<!-- page 121 -->

<p>"Well, then, Miss Critical, the comparison of the
wheat appears good on the surface, and is very suggestive:
but, upon looking closer, we find that the field
where the wheat is sown represents more properly the
individual chosen to do a work for the future; for, in the
breaking up and tearing to pieces of the soil, we have a
fit symbol of the trials, the discipline, to which such
souls are sure to be subjected, while the wheat stands
for the harvest of thoughts generated in their minds by
these experiences, and brought forth to bless the world."</p>

<p>"Is that all, father?"</p>

<p>"All that I have to say now, Maud: I wait for you."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that the seed-wheat poorly represent
the thoughts of the world's great reformers, from
the fact that a harvest is contemplated of the same kind
and quality; whereas, in the realm of mind, God chooses
and prepares his agents for the especial purpose of their
becoming channels through which broader, deeper, higher
thoughts may flow from himself to the great heart of
humanity."</p>

<p>"Little Sis," a term by which they called her, from
the fact that sickness had checked her growth till her
size did not correspond with her years: "Little Sis,"
said William, "I think I shall have to take lessons of
you in logic; but you must not, on that account, get
strong-minded, and fancy that it is your business to go
out and teach the world."</p>

<p>" 'Must not?' Is not that strong language from
pupil to teacher?" said she archly.</p>

<p>"Well, please don't, then."</p>

<p>"And why not? I opine that I should find many
people more ignorant than my brother; and who knows

<!-- page 122 -->

but I am one of God's elect, chosen through suffering
for this very purpose?"</p>

<p>This retort provoked a general laugh; which was
changed, however, into the quiet, tender tear, as they
looked upon her shrunken form and earnest face.</p>

<p>The moment's silence thus caused was broken by Mr.
Dare's saying to Alice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mrs. Shepherd, will you not favor us by giving your
opinion?"</p>

<p>"I am under the cloud," she replied, "and can not
see clearly; therefore have none to give."</p>

<p>"Under the cloud,&mdash;under the cloud;" how those
words lingered with her as an echo of the past! how
they took her back to Pete, and the last conversation
held with him!</p>

<p>Had he not said that she would yet see and hear, but
there was a cloud between. A part of the prophecy
had come true: why not the other?</p>

<!-- page 123 -->

<div class="center" id="X">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER X.</p>

<p class="small">DESPAIR.</p>

</div>

<p>ONE morning, when Alice had been three
months in Mr. Dare's family, Jennie came
to her room with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mrs. Shepherd, there is a gentleman
in the parlor who wishes to see you."</p>

<p>"To see me? Do you know who it is, Jennie?"</p>

<p>"I do not: he said he came from your old home."</p>

<p>Alice sat and thought a moment. "Jennie, please
go and ask him to send up his name."</p>

<p>The child did as she was requested, and returned in
a few moments with "William Holten, with best respects
to Mrs. Shepherd," written upon a neat card.</p>

<p>Upon taking it into her hand, Alice felt a shudder
running through her frame, and that before she had seen
the name, as she herself wondered, as she thought of it
afterward.</p>

<p>For a moment she hesitated, as if she dreaded to look:
but, when she had read it, a cold, stern look settled upon
her features; and, taking a pencil, she wrote underneath,
"Mrs. Shepherd will be excused," and sent it for answer
to the gentleman in waiting.</p>

<p>"I was frightened," said Jennie, in telling her sisters
of the circumstance, "he looked so angry; and, as he
went down the steps, I heard him say, 'Curse her: she

<!-- page 124 -->

shall pay for this.' Oh! I am afraid he will do our kind
teacher some harm."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind repeating his bad words, but pray
that good angels may watch over her," said the gentle
Maud.</p>

<p>"That I do every night," replied the child; "for
sometimes she looks so sad, that I fear she has something
to trouble her."</p>

<p>"Then we must try to make it up by being very kind;
and I know that my little Jennie will be good, so as to
give her as little trouble as possible."</p>

<p>"That I will, Sister Maud; for who could help being
good, with you for a sister and her for a teacher?"</p>

<p>Maud kissed her lovingly, and said, "There, run away
now, and see if mamma does not want you?" Mr.
Dare's younger children knew nothing of Alice's trouble,
neither did their parents think it best that they should.</p>

<p>William Holten went from Mr. Dare's door almost
choking with rage. Naturally calm and cool, no matter
how provoked, he was thus the more to be feared. His
self-possession was equal to Alice's, but used to compass
evil ends; and thus even his anger generally partook more
of the nature of steady heat intensified, than otherwise.
But now his self-possession was so disturbed, that he
could only find relief in revolving plans of vengeance.</p>

<p>"The proud, insulting jade," said he to himself: "I
will compass heaven and earth but I will yet have her
in my power." Having a friend, an old crony, who
occupied a post of trust in the prison, Holten went from
Mr. Dare's directly thither; and the first thing he did
on reaching it was to ask for John Shepherd and Robert
Taylor.</p>

<!-- page 125 -->

<p>He was left in the waiting-room while the officer in
charge went for them. "I wonder," he soliloquized,
"if they will treat me with the contempt that Miss Independence
did? they had better not; they had better
not." He had recovered his cool, calculating spirit, and,
as far as the external went, was a very saint.</p>

<p>The appearance of the prisoners put an end to these
cogitations. With his face covered with smiles, he
arose, extended his hand, with, "How are you, boys:
I am glad to see you, though I wish it could have been
elsewhere."</p>

<p>"Is it you, Holten?" said Taylor, not noticing the
extended hand; while Shepherd folded his arms upon
his breast, and remained silent.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut: now, don't be holding a grudge against a
friend for doing what he could not help. I am sure I
would not have appeared against you could I have
avoided it," said Holten, with one of his most winning
smiles.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Shepherd sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," repeated Holten. "I hope, John, you
do not suspect me of lacking in friendship for you. I
know that human nature is liable to err, and I should
be sorry to cast off an old companion for one fault."</p>

<p>"Silence," thundered Shepherd: "don't come here
calling yourself friend, and at the same time telling us
that you believe us guilty;" and then, turning with the
dignity of a king to the officer in charge, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you conduct us back to our places?"</p>

<p>And thus was Holten left to himself again; but the
malignant smile that lighted up his face as they passed
from the room was fearful to behold.</p>

<!-- page 126 -->

<p>He remained in the city, and visited his friend at the
prison from time to time; sometimes staying the entire
day, and sometimes only an hour or two. This friend,
Frederic Stanton by name, had charge of the kitchen
department; and, ten days after Holten had called upon
Alice, word came to her that her husband was dead,&mdash;had
died very suddenly, and from some unknown cause.</p>

<p>Mr. Dare was first informed, and upon him devolved
the task of telling the faithful wife. She seemed to
have a presentment of the coming evil; for, as she
looked into his sad face, she said very calmly, "Tell me
all: I can bear it better than the horror that has hung
over me for the last few hours." Thus entreated, the
good man, in as tender a manner as possible, told her of
her bereavement.</p>

<p>She listened with a calmness that was surprising; and,
when he was through, she only said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wish you to see, Mr. Dare, that there is an examination
made as to the cause of his death. I wish
the contents of his stomach analyzed."</p>

<p>"You do not suspect foul play, Mrs. Shepherd!"
said Mr. Dare in surprise.</p>

<p>She raised her eyes to his for a moment, and then,
with as little trace of emotion as though speaking of any
ordinary circumstance, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think the same agency that sent him to prison
while innocent has now sent him out of the world."</p>

<p>"What! how!" said Mr. Dare, with increasing surprise:
"how could that agency reach him in prison?"</p>

<p>"I have no tangible evidence to give," she replied;
"but I feel it, I know it: will you do what I ask?"</p>

<p>"I will, Mrs. Shepherd; and God help you to bear
this trial!"</p>

<!-- page 127 -->

<p>"Help," she replied,&mdash;"help, when all is gone: will
He restore my husband?"</p>

<p>"The good man sighed, and left her to herself."</p>

<p>"How did she bear it?" asked his wife, as he passed
out of Alice's room.</p>

<p>"So calmly that I tremble for her reason: go to her,
wife, and see that she is not left alone," was the reply.</p>

<p>An examination of Shepherd's stomach revealed the
presence of poison, but by whom given no one seemed
to have any idea but Alice; and her only reply, when
interrogated was, "I have no evidence."</p>

<p>A prisoner who sat next to him at meals, and who
had once or twice spoken rather ill-humoredly of the
deceased was, it is true, subjected to a slight examination;
but his innocence was so apparent that he was
soon discharged. William Holten staid till the grave
covered his victim, was very officious through all, and
seemed particularly desirous of thrusting himself upon
Alice's notice,&mdash;not for the purpose of sympathy, as
many supposed, but that he might thus the more
thoroughly torture her.</p>

<p>But the agony upon which he had hoped to feed his
soul did not manifest itself. She shed no tear, spoke no
word by means of which others might judge of her real
feelings; and those who had learned to love her so
well during the few months that she had been with
them shook their heads as they looked upon her impassive
face.</p>

<p>When all was over, she returned with Mr. Dare's
family to their home, went to her own room, and,
gathering up every thing calculated to remind her of the
lost one, she placed them in a little tin trunk, locked it,

<!-- page 128 -->

then went to the window, threw the key as far away as
she could, and, sitting down, folded her hands as though
she had nothing further to do upon earth.</p>

<p>The door stood ajar, and Mrs. Dare was watching her
from a room across the hall; but of this she seemed
unaware, or, if she knew it, cared not, but continued to
gaze into vacancy&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"Like the blank statue of despair,<br/>

Or madness graved in stone."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dare kept up her unobtrusive watch till the
bell sounded for supper: then, going to Alice's door, she
quietly said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mrs. Shepherd, tea is ready." Alice made no
reply, but arose, and followed her to the dining-room.
At the table she made no remark whatever; and, when
the family attempted to draw her into conversation, she
paid no attention to any thing that was said to her
that could not be answered by yes or no. The more
they tried to direct her mind from the source of her
grief, the more did she seem to shrink into herself; and
this meal was but a sample of what occurred, day by
day, for many weeks following.</p>

<p>She seemed more like one dead than otherwise.
True, she breathed, walked, ate, drank, and slept, the
same as ever; but these were more the mechanical
movements of an inanimate object than the spontaneous
efforts of a living soul.</p>

<p>Whatever affection could devise, or ingenuity suggest,
to win her back to her former self, was tried, but without
effect. Those who attempted to show her the
sinfulness of undue grief were silenced by a look from

<!-- page 129 -->

her great solemn eyes, and retired from the task, confessing
that the case was beyond their reach, and must
be dealt with by a more skillful hand.</p>

<p>She had lived only for her husband; or, it might
rather be said that her husband was her life: and, as
the body without the soul is dead, so was she without
the object of her affection; and only he who had permitted
this life of her soul to be taken from her knew
how to reinstate therein one that was higher and
better.</p>

<p>She maintained the same scrupulous care about her
room and person that she had ever done; but this was
so much the result of habit, that it required no exertion,
no thought for its performance. The children who had
been her care, and who had delighted in her smile, now
shunned as much as they had once sought her society.
There was something so sacred in the deep grief which
had fallen like a thick veil upon her spirit, that the
joyous laugh of youth was hushed at the sight, while
age looked on with a pitying sigh.</p>

<p>The months passed in quick succession. The golden
hues of summer were resting upon the ripening harvest;
but no ray of light had, as yet, found its way into the
cloud resting upon her spirit. Sunshine and storm,
cold and heat, summer and winter, were alike to one
who was insensible to outward influences.</p>

<p>Friends began to despair, looking upon her case as
hopeless. Addie Winchester had tried in vain to
induce her to stay a while with them; and Mr. Dare
himself said that she was incurable, unless she could
be benefited by treatment in a neighboring asylum, to
which place he was about to have her removed, when

<!-- page 130 -->

an uncle, her father's youngest and only remaining
brother, came to seek her.</p>

<p>His presence awoke the memories of childhood, and
for a time she seemed partially to revive.</p>

<p>This uncle was but two years the senior of Alice,
had been the playmate of her childhood, and the
affection subsisting between them was more like that of
brother and sister than aught else. She was but ten
years of age when her grandparents removed to the
far West; and long and bitterly did she lament the loss
of her Uncle James.</p>

<p>She knew him, notwithstanding the change that
years had made; and for the first time in all these
weary months she smiled. She seemed interested
when he told her of his Western home, his beautiful
residence, his lovely wife, and the little daughter named
for herself; but, when he attempted to draw from her
something of her own history, she turned away with
such a look of agony upon her face, that he never dared
to approach the subject again.</p>

<p>After some entreaty, he induced her to go to New-York
City with him, for the purpose of visiting old
scenes and old friends. She had been there but two
days, however, when she met Robert Sawtelle, and
from that time forth she could be induced to go out no
more. She relapsed gradually into her old condition,
and thus were her friends doomed to disappointment.</p>

<p>True, she consented to go with her uncle to his
Western home; but it was in a spirit of passive hopelessness,
that left no expectation of her being benefited
thereby. They stopped at different points on their way
westward; visited relations both on her father's and

<!-- page 131 -->

mother's side: but still the lovely sufferer was sunk in
apathy, still she bowed like one benumbed beneath the
stroke of her affliction.</p>

<p>James Vale looked on in sadness. Sorrowfully he
asked within himself, "And is there nothing that will
penetrate the darkness?" and echo answered, "Nothing
that human wisdom can devise."</p>

<p>They were but two days from their journey's end
when Alice came into the sitting-room in the morning
with a smile upon her face; and, in answer to her uncle's
inquiring look, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Uncle James, I have seen Pete,&mdash;Crazy Pete, they
used to call him."</p>

<p>"Where did you see him, Alice?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He came and stood beside my bed, uncle."</p>

<p>"Came and stood beside your bed! What business
had he in your room?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't understand, uncle!" said she. "Pete
was the best playmate I ever had."</p>

<p>"Better than Uncle James?"</p>

<p>"If you interrupt me again, I shall tell you nothing
further," said she, with a spark of her old vivacity.
"Yes: better than Uncle James; for he told me of things
that others do not seem to know any thing about. People
called him crazy; but he wasn't. Well, he died
more than five years ago. He told me of it before it
happened, though he didn't call it dying. He said that
he was going to live with his mother,&mdash;that she came
and told him so.</p>

<p>"He said that I should see as he did some day,&mdash;should
both see and hear,&mdash;but that there was a dark
cloud between. God knows that the cloud has come,

<!-- page 132 -->

and dark enough too;" and, sinking into a chair, she
broke into a passionate fit of weeping.</p>

<p>Blessed tears! How they soothed the parched brain!
how they relieved the dull ache of the heart!</p>

<p>Mr. Vale was astonished. Her words indicated to
him an increase of her malady; but her looks and her
tears were the reverse. He wisely resolved, however,
to let her weep as long as she pleased.</p>

<p>It was some time before she was sufficiently calm to
speak again; and, when she did, her first words were,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You need not tell me, uncle, that it was a dream;
for I know I was awake."</p>

<p>"I presume you think you were: some dreams are
very vivid, Alice," he replied.</p>

<p>"I tell you I was not dreaming: I had not been to
sleep. I heard the clock strike one, two, three; and, just
after the last, I saw Peter standing by my bed, looking
just as when I saw him last. He did not speak, but
smiled so sweetly, pointed the way we are going, shook
his head, bowed, smiled again, and was gone. I was not
a bit afraid, but so glad: for, if I can see him, I shall see
John some time;" and again she fell to weeping. This
was the first time that she had spoken her husband's
name since his form was buried from her sight.</p>

<p>Puzzled beyond his power to solve, Mr. Vale resolved
to humor her fancies, as he believed them to be, and so
asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What do you suppose he meant, Alice, by shaking
his head, then smiling again?"</p>

<p>"It seemed to me to indicate danger close at hand,
but that it would be safely passed."</p>

<p>"Why do you think that?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, uncle: I only feel that it is so."</p>

<!-- page 133 -->

<p>"Well, well, we will think no more about it now:
there is the bell for breakfast, and the train goes soon
after. If we have no bad luck, we shall reach home to-morrow."</p>

<p>All that day Alice continued cheerful; and still her
uncle watched her even more closely than before. Man's
efforts to restore her had failed, because they had no
comfort to give; but, when the angels came with their
healing, they were distrusted.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p class="small">RETRIBUTION.</p>

</div>

<p>AND where was Holten all of this time?
Had the leopard changed his skin, or the
tiger his nature? Had he given up the
object for which he had periled so much?
Far from it.</p>

<p>The idea of possessing Alice Shepherd had taken
entire control of him,&mdash;was the master, and he the slave.
For this he had given up his place in Mr. Brown's store,
resolved that nothing should stand between him and the
accomplishment of his nefarious purpose. And for this
he had followed them from point to point with the pertinacity
of a hawk in pursuit of a dove.</p>

<p>He had disguised himself, so that Alice did not recognize
his person; and he was careful that she should not
hear his voice, and recognize him by that. In this manner
he would ride behind them in the cars for hours,
catching every word, and thus, learning their plans,
would lay his accordingly.</p>

<p>It is said that "like attracts like," and that if we
"seek we shall find." It is certain, that, in Holten's
case, one disguise attracted another, and that, in accepting
another rascal's aid as he supposed, he only plucked
the fruit grown from seed of his own planting.</p>

<p>Before he came to the peaceful village where Alice

<!-- page 135 -->

had resided, he was acquainted with two boys by the
names of Berton Cooley and Silas Porter. These boys,
striplings just verging into manhood, looked enough
alike to have been brothers; though it was not known
that there was any relationship between them. But,
though alike in person, it was hardly possible for two to
be more unlike in disposition.</p>

<p>Silas Porter was an honest lad, who toiled hard to
help support his mother and sister, and despised meanness
of all kinds as heartily as mean, tricky boys hated
him: while Berton Cooley, or "Bert," as he was called,
was just the reverse; and the meaner, the more tricky,
one was, the better he liked him.</p>

<p>Though Holten was some years the oldest, still he
and Bert were fast friends, and continued so till Holten
chanced to see Porter's sister. But from this time forth
he assiduously cultivated Porter's friendship, and seemed
to have broken entirely with Cooley; but the following
conversation, which took place between them about this
time, shows the true state of the case.</p>

<p>"Cooley, are you acquainted with Porter's sister?"
said Holten one day, soon after seeing Miss Porter for
the first time.</p>

<p>"Not much: she is too d&mdash;&mdash;d proud for me."</p>

<p>"Proud; and pray what has she to be proud of, I
should like to know?"</p>

<p>"Nothing more than other folks. I think it is her
brother's fault; for he seems determined that none but
the good folks, the saints, shall come near her.</p>

<p>"God! how I should like to get her away from him,
to pay him for some of his impudence! Don't you think
he told me the other day, right to my face, that I wasn't
fit for any decent girl to associate with."</p>

<!-- page 136 -->

<p>"Why didn't you knock him down? I would have
done it for you had I been there," said Holten, smothering
the joy he felt at thus finding a tool ready for his
purpose, under a well-feigned indignation at what he
called his friend's wrongs.</p>

<p>"I wish you had been there, Holten. I would have
knocked his teeth down his throat, only he had too many
friends around."</p>

<p>"Yes: that's it, Cooley. Such fellows always have
plenty of friends; and the only way that we can get the
start of them is by stratagem. Now, I have a plan,
Bert; and, if you will assist me, I think we can carry it
out."</p>

<p>"Name it! name it! any thing to make him bite the
dust, and I am with you."</p>

<p>"Cool, keep cool, Bert, or I shall not dare to trust
you."</p>

<p>"Yes: I'll be as cool as an iceberg in January, if that
is what you want."</p>

<p>"But I shall have to cut your acquaintance, call you
a bad boy, &amp;c."</p>

<p>"Why must you do that?"</p>

<p>"To make Porter and his sister think I am all right,&mdash;that
I am one of the saints."</p>

<p>"I don't see the use of that."</p>

<p>"Not if I succeed in making Marion Porter what her
brother would shoot any one for calling her now?"</p>

<p>"O Holten! that would be too bad."</p>

<p>"I thought you liked the girl?" said Holten with a
meaning smile.</p>

<p>"And so I do; but I hate her brother."</p>

<p>"Have you any hope, any chance, of success?"</p>

<!-- page 137 -->

<p>"Not in the least, that I can see."</p>

<p>"And all through her brother's watchfulness?"</p>

<p>"Not wholly. I don't think I could win the girl
anyhow."</p>

<p>"Then she is proud too. No, Bert," continued
Holten: "there is no hope for you, unless she is humbled.
I can see that in her eye. If you were not so
well acquainted with her, I would advise you to play
good; but now you would be suspected if you attempted
it. But, if you will remain my friend, I will win her,
and then throw her into your arms. She will be only
too glad to find a friend when I leave her.</p>

<p>"You can thus possess her, and have your revenge
on her brother. You are but young yet: in a year
you will seem much more like a man, will have a better
chance with the girls; and it will take me at least a year
to get around the beauty, for I shall have to play sharp,
or fail."</p>

<p>The lad, for he was hardly nineteen, studied a moment,
and then said, "Holten, I swear I will do it."</p>

<p>"Your hand on it," said Holten.</p>

<p>"Yes: my hand on it; here it is. But I didn't think
there was so much devil about you, Holten."</p>

<p>Holten smiled at the compliment. "We must look
out for number one, in this world of Priests and Levites,"
said he, "or go to the wall."</p>

<p>"Are you sure, Cooley," he continued, after a moment's
silence, "that you can carry this thing out? Remember,
that to the outside world we are enemies,&mdash;must
act as such on all occasions; or, rather, you must
be my enemy, and curse me for trying to make a good
boy of you."</p>

<!-- page 138 -->

<p>"Yes: I'll remember," said Cooley. "Oh, how
hard you are trying now! I think I shall be good soon;"
and, throwing himself upon the grass, he laughed till the
tears rolled down his cheeks.</p>

<p>And thus was the compact made between these two,
and all for the purpose of ruining one innocent girl.</p>

<p>Holten worked faithfully for a year, and succeeded
only in breaking Marion Porter's heart. He never had
the privilege of possessing her himself, much less that of
throwing her into his friend's arms, as he had boasted.</p>

<p>Marion learned to love him, believing him to be noble
and true. When she found to the contrary, the shock
was too severe for her gentle, loving nature; and,
broken-hearted, she sank rapidly to the grave.</p>

<p>Her brother said but little; but such was the determination
of his look, and the fire of his eye, that Holten
thought best to leave the place.</p>

<p>When Porter found he had really gone, he simply
remarked, "The atmosphere is at least free from the
poison of his presence." Cooley, too, soon after left
the neighborhood; but, before going, he had revealed
to a companion the compact he had made with Holten:
that friend told it to another; and he had not been gone
two weeks, before it came to Porter's ears.</p>

<p>"Well for him that I did not know it sooner," said
Silas quietly; but from that time forth he watched
and waited. From that time two individuals stood forth
so plainly on the page of his memory, that there was
not the least danger of their being forgotten.</p>

<p>During the autumn that Alice and her uncle were thus
visiting from place to place, Silas Porter, now grown to
the full vigor of manhood, held a commission as traveling

<!-- page 139 -->

agent for a flourishing firm in Buffalo, and several
times he had been a passenger in the same train with
them. Latterly he had noticed a man near them
several times, whom it seemed to him that he ought to
know; and still he could not remember where they had
met.</p>

<p>He further noticed, that this strange man was sure to
be near the sad-looking lady and her companion; but
that, though watching them closely, he never spoke to
them. "I must unravel this mystery," said he to himself;
"and, if there does not prove to be mischief at the
bottom of it, I am mistaken."</p>

<p>On the morning that Alice averred she had seen Pete,
it so chanced that James Vale, Alice, Silas Porter, and
this stranger went to the depot in the same hack, and
took seats near each other in the same car; and, while
stepping from the hack, the stranger made an impatient
gesture, by means of which Porter recognized him.</p>

<p>"It is Holten disguised: I am right about the mischief,"
was his quick thought. Alice, for the first time
since she started, was cheerful. Holten watched her
with increased interest, and Porter watched him.</p>

<p>All at once, Porter remembered how much he used
to resemble Berton Cooley. "I will do it," said he: "I
will pass myself for Cooley, and claim his acquaintance."</p>

<p>With him to resolve was to do; and, taking a seat beside
Holten, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've been thinking, sir, that I ought to know you;
but, until this moment, have puzzled my brains in vain."</p>

<p>Holten gave him a quick-side glance, and replied, "I
think you are mistaken: I have never met you, to my
knowledge."</p>

<!-- page 140 -->

<p>Porter put his finger to his lip, cast a quick glance
toward Alice and her uncle, and then said in a low tone,
"Come this way, sir, and I will talk with you."</p>

<p>Holten looked surprised, then distrustful, but finally
decided to go. They took a seat in the farther end of
the car, when Holten demanded, "Now, sir, I wish to
know what this means?"</p>

<p>"It means that I do not wish to frighten your game,
so thought it best to get beyond their hearing," replied
Porter with a laugh.</p>

<p>Holten scowled savagely, and placed his hand upon
his pistol. "This is beyond endurance."</p>

<p>"Oh! don't wake up that barker now!" said Porter,
laughing harder than ever: "this is a pretty greeting for
an old friend, isn't it?" he continued.</p>

<p>"In the Devil's name, who are you?" growled Holten
in reply.</p>

<p>"I suppose you don't remember Bert Cooley, eh?"
replied Porter with the utmost coolness.</p>

<p>Holten's countenance changed: he scanned the man
beside him closely. "It can't be," said he; "and yet I
do see some resemblance."</p>

<p>"And I see <i>some resemblance</i> between you and
William Holten," replied Porter, mimicking his tones.</p>

<p>"You do know me; but I was not certain of it till you
called my name," said Holten, grasping Porter's hand:
"but how in h&mdash;&mdash;l did you recognize me?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I watched you. I thought there was something
about you that was familiar; and I kept thinking
where had I seen you? At last you made a peculiar
motion that I never saw any one else make: then I
knew who it was. But what is up now?" he asked,
glancing toward Alice.</p>

<!-- page 141 -->

<p>"Oh! nothing in particular."</p>

<p>"Now, you needn't think to fool me, for I know that
there is: neither need you fear to trust me. Don't you
remember Marion Porter, and how we planned about
her. Didn't I do my part well?"</p>

<p>"Well enough," replied Holten impatiently, for the
subject was not a pleasant one.</p>

<p>"Oh, now, you needn't feel badly because you didn't
succeed!" drawled Porter: "the best of folks fail sometimes.
I only spoke of it to show you that I was true
blue."</p>

<p>"I believe you are, Cooley, and I will try you," said
Holten; "for I think I shall need some help."</p>

<p>"Be thankful, then, that the Old Nick has thrown
some in your way," laughed Porter, while Holten proceeded
to unfold his plans.</p>

<p>"At a farm-house?" asked Porter.</p>

<p>"Yes: they stop to-day at Smith's Station. We reach
there just before night. These friends of theirs live
fifteen miles away, but will send a conveyance for them.
It is pleasant weather, and their conveyance will be an
open two-seated carriage; and Alice can be taken from
the hind seat easily if we manage right."</p>

<p>"To be sure she can; but when did you learn all this,
Holten?"</p>

<p>"More than a week since, I heard the gentleman&mdash;uncle,
she calls him&mdash;tell her what day they should
reach the end of their route by rail, how far and in what
direction his wife's father lived, and that he had written
for him to meet them. I then went ahead to reconnoiter.
I know every step of the way, have my plans all laid,
and I hardly think the bird will ever reach that nest.

<!-- page 142 -->

She has insulted me once too often; and, when I have
her in my power, sha'n't she pay for it though."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed Porter: "now you look like your
own self, Holten. I should hate to fall into your power,
were I your enemy."</p>

<p>"And well you might; but don't speak quite so loud.
Should my lady-bird find me out before we leave the
cars, it would be all day with my plans; for I really believe
she can read my very thoughts when once her attention
is turned toward me."</p>

<p>"How far beyond the farm-house does this man (Vale,
I think you called him) live?" asked Porter.</p>

<p>"Some thirty miles, I believe: they intend to go there
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And is the road across the prairie away from settlements?"</p>

<p>"I don't really know, though I believe it is; but why
do you ask?"</p>

<p>"I thought," said Porter, "that, if we failed to-night,
we might have another chance to-morrow."</p>

<p>"But we must not fail, Bert."</p>

<p>"Not if it can be avoided; but you know, Holten,
that the best plans of men and mice&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="small">'Gang aft agley.' "</p>

</div>

<p>"I know, I know, Cooley; but I swear, by the Eternal
God, that I will succeed in this, or die."</p>

<p>"Die, then; for succeed, you shall not," said Porter
to himself; but outwardly he was as calm as a summer
morning.</p>

<p>Holten was about to take his old post behind Alice

<!-- page 143 -->

and her uncle; but Porter prevented him by saying,
"Let me sit there, Holten: I can plan to get into conversation
with them, and my voice won't betray me as
it might you. I can question them, and find out if they
have made any change in their plans, better than you
can."</p>

<p>"Well, do so: but I shall watch you, Cooley; and, if
you do play me false, I will shoot you," said Holten,
looking as if he did not quite trust Porter after all.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! why should I play you false? What interest
have I in these people?" said the pretended
Cooley, as he moved forward to take the seat indicated.</p>

<p>He managed to attract Mr. Vale's attention, and get
into conversation in a very short time; made himself as
agreeable as possible; and, when they had talked fifteen
or twenty minutes, he drew Alice's attention to something
that could be seen from the car-window, and at
the same time thrust a piece of paper into Mr. Vale's
hand, on which was penciled,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go into the smoking-car: I have something to say
to you. I will follow soon: we are watched.</p>

<p>A FRIEND."</p>

<p>Vale read it, and instantly the words of Alice, "I
think it meant danger safely passed," flashed through
his mind. But the words, "we are watched," told him
the necessity of suppressing all emotion; and he governed
himself accordingly.</p>

<p>Porter continued to talk to Alice for some minutes,
thus giving her uncle time to think,&mdash;to plan. Presently,
as Porter turned toward him, he said, "I don't
think I have a fair chance with my niece for a rival: I

<!-- page 144 -->

hardly get my share in the conversation. Suppose we
adjourn to the smoking-car; or don't you use the weed?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir: there is nothing I like better than
a good Havana; but I prefer staying here a little longer,
unless you are afraid to trust me with your charge,"
giving him, at the same time, a significant look.</p>

<p>"Not at all, not at all, sir: and I shall leave you here
with the lady just to show you that your suspicions are
unfounded;" and, rising from his seat, he sauntered away
in as nonchalant a manner as he could assume.</p>

<p>Porter talked with Alice, perhaps five minutes after
he left; and then starting up, as if suddenly recollecting
something that should be done immediately, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Excuse me, lady, but I must speak to my friend
yonder a moment;" and, going quickly to Holten's seat,
he clapped him on the shoulder with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Things are going on swimmingly; but I remember
the promise you made me in regard to Marion, and shall
claim its fulfillment in this case, for she is lovely enough
to quicken the pulse of a Stoic."</p>

<p>"What promise?" said Holten, affecting not to remember.</p>

<p>"What promise! just as if you had forgotten; but I
see how it is: you wish to keep this one all to yourself."</p>

<p>"I see what you are driving at now, and it shall be
as you say; but I shall have ample revenge first."</p>

<p>"Why, man, that will be but a continuation of your
revenge; but I must see Mr. Vale again: he don't seem
just willing to talk freely before the lady. He invited
me to have a smoke with him, and I refused; but I will
make an excuse to look after my baggage, and stop on
my way back." And, without waiting for further comment
from Holten, he hastened to find Vale.</p>

<!-- page 145 -->

<p>"Now, what does all this mean?" inquired that gentleman,
as soon as Porter was seated.</p>

<p>"I can not tell you all it means now; for it would
take too long, and would excite suspicion in the mind of
the villain whose plans I wish to defeat. But this much
I will say. If you have no pistol, get one; and, when
you cross the ravine five miles this side of where you
stop to-night, keep both eyes open, and shoot the first
man who lays hands on the lady."</p>

<p>"But I have no pistol, and don't know where I can
get one," said Mr. Vale in astonishment. "And, further,
I can see no reason why any one should wish to
disturb my niece."</p>

<p>"A defeated lover will sometimes do any thing," replied
Porter.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, I begin to see. I think I will not go on
till to-morrow, and thus avoid the danger. I"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And leave him to carry out his scheme when you
are not warned?"</p>

<p>"There is something in that," said Mr. Vale thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"He is disguised," continued Porter: "otherwise
Mrs. Shepherd would know him immediately; he dare
not even trust his voice in her hearing."</p>

<p>"If I was sure that there would be no danger"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"No danger at all, Mr. Vale: I will let you have my
pistol. I shall not need it; and we can thus bring the
knave to justice."</p>

<p>"Why are you so anxious in the matter?" asked Mr.
Vale, looking Porter full in the eye.</p>

<p>"An only sister went to the grave broken-hearted,
sir;" and, pausing a moment to suppress his emotion, he

<!-- page 146 -->

continued, "He does not know who I am, or he would
not trust me: he believes me to be another person entirely.
If you have occasion to address me, call me
Cooley; but that is not my true name.</p>

<p>"Promise me, sir, that you will go on, as you have
intended," added Porter, after waiting for something
further from his companion.</p>

<p>"Will you be there?" asked Mr. Vale.</p>

<p>"I shall, and shall seize the horses by the bits; so
don't fire that way."</p>

<p>Still Mr. Vale hesitated.</p>

<p>"I wait your answer," said Porter anxiously; "for
I must not remain here longer."</p>

<p>"Danger safely passed," again came to Mr. Vale's
mind; and he replied, "I will go on."</p>

<p>"Thanks, but don't alarm the lady," said Porter, as
he hastily made his exit.</p>

<p>He found Holten looking moody, but soon put him
in good humor again, with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was d&mdash;&mdash;d 'fraid that they would not go on till
morning; but it's all right now, and you may thank me
for it."</p>

<p>"How?" asked Holten. Porter drew upon his
imagination for a fitting reply, and to keep his companion
entertained as the cars sped onward to their destination.</p>

<p>The train was behind time; and it was nearly sundown
when they reached the station where Alice and
her uncle were to stop. "It is a bright moonlight
night, and it will be a fine ride that we shall have across
the prairie," said Mr. Vale to Alice.</p>

<p>"Is it all prairie, uncle?" she asked.</p>

<!-- page 147 -->

<p>"No: there is a ravine, through which runs a creek,
and a patch of timber some five miles this side our
journey's end," was the reply.</p>

<p>"I am glad it is late," said Holten to Porter, "as it
will be all the better for us;" and, making a hasty meal
while two fine horses were being saddled, they were
soon speeding their way over the prairie in a somewhat
different direction from that which Mr. Vale was to
take.</p>

<p>He took things more leisurely; and it was at least
half an hour after Holten and Porter left before he was
ready to start. "The road is perfectly plain, I hope,"
said Alice to the boy who had been sent with the carriage.</p>

<p>"Perfectly so," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Why do you ask that, Alice? I hope you are not
getting timid," said her uncle, smiling.</p>

<p>"No, uncle; but there is danger somewhere, and I
did not know but it might be on the prairie. I have
been told that people get lost sometimes on account of
there being so many different roads."</p>

<p>"Nonsense about your danger: you are getting to be
a coward, that is all."</p>

<p>"You will see, uncle."</p>

<p>"Danger to-night, do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I do, sir," she replied.</p>

<p>"If your prediction proves true, we shall count Alice
among the prophets," said Mr. Vale, laughing to hide
the surprise he felt.</p>

<p>"As you please, uncle;" and for a time they rode
on in silence. Indeed, each seemed to be busy with
their own thoughts, and little inclined for conversation;

<!-- page 148 -->

but, as they neared the ravine, Alice turned to Mr.
Vale, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you think I am asleep now, uncle?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not: why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Because you say I was dreaming last night, when
I tell you that I saw Pete."</p>

<p>"Alice, what do you mean?" he exclaimed in a
startled tone.</p>

<p>"I mean that he is here now, and John is with him,"
she answered as quietly as though it was an every-day
occurrence.</p>

<p>"Will wonders never cease?" was his inward comment;
and to her, "Do they say any thing, Alice?"</p>

<p>"Pete says, 'Fear not:' John only smiles."</p>

<p>They were now fairly in the ravine. Mr. Vale had
taken Porter's pistol from his pocket, and was holding
it firmly in his hand; for, in spite of his pretended disbelief,
the words of Alice gave him courage.</p>

<p>They crossed the stream, and were about to ascend
upon the other side, when two horsemen dashed into
the road ahead of them. One of them grasped the
horses by the bits, and the other made for the side of
the carriage where Alice sat; but, just as he gathered
his arm about her, a ball penetrated his shoulder.</p>

<p>Holten&mdash;for it was him of course&mdash;had not anticipated
such a reception; for he supposed that Mr. Vale
was not armed. The shock was so sudden that he lost
his balance; and, at the same moment, Vale's driver
struck his horse with the whip-handle, causing the animal
to dash aside, and thus complete his rider's fall.
He tried to hold on to the bridle; but the frightened
beast reared, wheeled, and then started forward, throwing

<!-- page 149 -->

him so violently against a tree as to knock him senseless,
tearing his foot from the stirrup, and breaking his
leg at the same time.</p>

<p>Porter now loosed his hold of the bits; and the driver
was about to lash his horses into a run, when Mr. Vale's
voice arrested the movement.</p>

<p>"The danger is over; the other is a friend," said he:
"let us stop, and look after this one."</p>

<p>Alice had not spoken till now, neither had she manifested
the least fear; but, as Porter and her uncle dismounted
to look after the fallen man, she calmly remarked,
"William Holten, I thought your turn would
come some time."</p>

<p>Her uncle looked up inquiringly. "Pete told me,"
she said; and he questioned no further.</p>

<p>Holten was alive, but badly injured; and, as they found
it impossible to take him with them, they were consulting
as to what was best to be done, when another
team came in sight. This proved to be a farmer, with
a good farm-wagon, in which there were two or three
bundles of straw.</p>

<p>Into this they lifted Holten, Porter staying behind
to help care for him, while Mr. Vale rode Porter's horse,
and Alice went on with the driver, a lad of fifteen, and
brother to Mrs. Vale.</p>

<p>Mr. Vale and his party reached their destination an
hour before the wounded man was brought thither; for
the latter had partially revived, and the motion of the
wagon gave him so much pain that they could move
but slowly.</p>

<p>By the time they reached Mr. Shelton's, Holten was
so far conscious as to recognize the place. "In the

<!-- page 150 -->

name of God, where are you taking me, Cooley?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"My name is not Cooley. I have deceived you; and,
when I tell you that I am Silas Porter, you will know
why," was the reply that greeted his ears.</p>

<p>A deep groan was the only response to this announcement.
The doctor arrived presently, for he had
been sent for as soon as Mr. Vale reached his father-in-law's
house; and, upon examination, pronounced it
impossible for the wounded man to live more than two or
three days. For, besides the shoulder and broken limb,
there were internal injuries that could not be reached.</p>

<p>When Alice learned this, she went to his bedside,
fixed her eyes upon him, and stood some moments without
speaking. At last she said, "William Holten, the
dead are beyond your reach; but there is still time to
do justice to the living."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Mrs. Shepherd?" he asked,
turning toward her a face where pain and fear were
striving for the mastery.</p>

<p>"The doctor says that you can not live, and there is
one languishing in prison whom you can set free: that
is what I mean," was her reply.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Shepherd, you do not suppose that I know
aught of that theft?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and of a murder too."</p>

<p>He turned his face away, and lay quiet, as far as his
sufferings would permit, for perhaps ten minutes. At
length he asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Doctor, how long can I live?"</p>

<p>"You are pretty sure of twenty-four hours, and have
one chance out of three of lasting two or three days
longer," was the response.</p>

<!-- page 151 -->

<p>"Very exact in your calculations, sir," said Holten,
with something of his old spirit.</p>

<p>"I suppose that was what you wanted," replied the
doctor.</p>

<p>Another silence.</p>

<p>"If you have any business matters to arrange, had
you not better attend to it immediately?" asked Mr.
Vale; and, for reply, Holten called for a justice of the
peace.</p>

<p>"Would you not like to see a minister too?" asked
Mr. Shelton.</p>

<p>"Not yet, not yet," was the reply. "There is something
else to be done first: where is Porter?"</p>

<p>"Here," was the response, as Porter stepped around
where the dying man could see him.</p>

<p>"Silas Porter," said he, "you have deceived and
betrayed me; but I can not blame you, for I murdered
your only sister. I do not mean that I poisoned or
stabbed her; but I deliberately planned her ruin,&mdash;won
her heart for that purpose: failed, it is true; but
she loved me, and the knowledge of my perfidy sent
her to the grave. It seems like mockery to ask your
forgiveness; but how can I die without it?"</p>

<p>"If my forgiveness were all that was needed to
secure you a place where her pure spirit dwells, you
would never get it," was Porter's stern reply.</p>

<p>"Forgive as you would be forgiven," said Mr. Shelton
solemnly.</p>

<p>"Work out your own salvation," responded Porter.
"This last is Scripture as much as the other, and far
more in accordance with the principles of justice."</p>

<p>"Mercy is God's favorite attribute," continued Mr.
Shelton.</p>

<!-- page 152 -->

<p>"And justice is mine," replied Porter: "accord to us
justice, and we shall need less mercy."</p>

<p>"It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the
living God," persisted Mr. Shelton, with a sigh at what
seemed to him the young man's perverseness.</p>

<p>"And I should say that it was more fearful to fall
out of them. Mr. Shelton, you, no doubt, think me a
wicked wretch; but I want no heaven that I do not
earn."</p>

<p>Mr. Shelton held up both hands in horror. "And
you would count the blood of the covenant an unholy
thing! Young man, if such are your sentiments, this
is no place for you, by the bedside of the dying. Talk
about forgiving him: you are the more wicked of the
two."</p>

<p>"More wicked to doubt the prevailing theology than
to rob, murder, or ravish innocence: no wonder that
the world is sunk in wickedness!" murmured Porter
to himself, as he passed from the room.</p>

<p>"Infidelity of the worst form," groaned Mr. Shelton:
"and I am told that there is a class of persons who
claim to hold communion with the departed; and
they assert that the spirits of our friends and neighbors,
even those who were good Christians here, come back
and teach the same doctrine. 'Anathema maran-atha;
anathema maran-atha.' "</p>

<p>" 'Let him be accursed.' Is that what you say of
the young man who has just left the room?" asked
Alice.</p>

<p>"Why not, if he teaches the doctrine of devils?"</p>

<p>"If, by that, you refer to those who come back to us
from the other side of the grave, they are not all devils,

<!-- page 153 -->

Mr. Shelton. Peter Stiverton is no devil, and I know
John Shepherd is not; and I have seen them both."</p>

<p>Mr. Shelton looked at his son-in-law, and the latter
touched his forehead significantly.</p>

<p>"I thought so, I thought so," said the old gentleman
to himself.</p>

<p>Holten had listened to the conversation with a good
deal of interest; and his face flushed with satisfaction
when Mr. Shelton pronounced Porter more wicked than
himself.</p>

<p>The justice had now arrived; and steps were taken
to have the dying man's deposition taken as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>It was thought that Alice was having too much excitement,
and had better leave the room: but she
objected; and, as Holten desired her to stay, she was
permitted to remain. Holten was first sworn, and then
proceeded to give the details of the plot by means of
which John Shepherd and his friend had been convicted
and sent to prison; ending with the confession that he
had murdered Shepherd by means of poison dropped
into his food, after it was dealt out, and before Shepherd
had taken his seat.</p>

<p>He then told of his determination to possess Alice at
all events; how he had a place prepared where her
friends could not have found her, &amp;c. "And I should
have succeeded but for Porter. Still, that gentleman,"
pointing to Mr. Shelton, "says that he is more wicked
than I am; so perhaps there may be hope for such
as me."</p>

<p>Mr. Shelton flushed, but asked, "You do not expect
to go to heaven upon your own merits, Mr. Holten?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not: how could I?"</p>

<!-- page 154 -->

<p>"You are willing to accept pardon through the merits
of Christ Jesus?"</p>

<p>"I am, if I could only be sure that he would accept
me."</p>

<p>"Young man, there is hope for you. He says,
'Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest.' Are you not one of the
heavy laden?"</p>

<p>"Laden with a life-long load of sin," replied Holten
with a sigh.</p>

<p>"But you are sorry for it?"</p>

<p>"Could I blot it out, I certainly would."</p>

<p>"Go to Jesus, young man; cast yourself upon his
mercy: it was for such as you that he died," said Mr.
Shelton, his face lighting up at the prospect of saving a
soul. "Examine your own heart well, though; for
death-bed repentance is apt to be deceptive," he
continued, after a moment's pause; "but we will leave
you now to the care of those who are to watch with
you, and to your own thoughts. In the morning, we
will send for the Rev. Mr. Stevens: he can instruct
you in the right way better than I can!"</p>

<p>Accordingly Mr. Stevens was sent for. He read and
prayed with the repentant sinner, as he called Holten,
and left him with high hopes that he would be as a
brand plucked from the burning.</p>

<p>Mr. Porter, having nothing farther to detain him,
went his way; but more than one comment was made
upon his unforgiving disposition, and more than one
shake of the head in reference to his infidelity.</p>

<p>Holten was hurt on Wednesday evening, died on
Friday about the same hour, and was buried on Sunday.

<!-- page 155 -->

Mr. Stevens attended him to the last; preached
his funeral sermon, taking the words of Jesus to the
thief on the cross, as his text; and carrying the idea
to his audience, that William Holten had given sufficient
evidence of a change of heart to warrant the belief that
he was then with Jesus in paradise.</p>

<p>Mr. Shelton, when he reached home after the funeral
services were over, found one of his youngest boys, a
lad of some eight summers, very busily engaged in play.</p>

<p>"Fie, fie, my son!" said he, "What do you suppose
will become of you if you play on Sunday?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I love to play," said the little fellow; "but I
will get very sorry for it just before I die, and then it
will all be right."</p>

<p>The father was too much surprised to reply; while
Alice, like Mary of old, pondered all these things in
her heart.</p>

<p>Mr. Vale, having tarried at his father-in-law's longer
than he intended, started early the following morning
for his own home. Alice was quietly cheerful; for the
loved ones from the shores of life immortal had made
their presence known to her, thus pouring comfort into
her despairing soul. But her uncle looked upon her
with far more anxiety than when sunk in gloom; for
surely none but the insane talked as she did.</p>

<div class="center" id="XII">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>

<p class="small">MORE THEOLOGY.</p>

</div>

<p>SILAS PORTER'S business led him to
the town in which Mr. Vale resided; and
he, of course, received an invitation to
call there as often as was convenient while
he remained in the place,&mdash;an invitation
that he was not slow to accept: for, in all his travels,
he had never met a lady who interested him as Alice
did.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vale, Mr. Shelton's daughter, was a church-member
of the Methodist persuasion, and very zealous
in her profession; while her husband belonged to that
numerous class who do not claim to be Christians, but
feel that they ought to be. Such, standing self-condemned
before their own souls, are ever earnest in defending
the doctrines of the church, fully intending,
some day, to make preaching and practice correspond.</p>

<p>Mr. Vale, as I have said, belonged to this class; and,
having heard the remarks made by Porter at Holten's
bedside, their conversation very naturally turned in that
direction.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Mr. Porter, by saying that you
wanted no heaven but what you earned?" he asked,
upon the second evening of Porter's calling at his house.
Mrs. Vale looked up with surprise, not unmingled

<!-- page 157 -->

with horror, depicted upon her countenance, "Why,
Mr. Porter, you did not say that?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I did, madam; and I meant it too."</p>

<p>"But why? What are your reasons for so strange an
assertion?" said her husband.</p>

<p>"Because I believe it to be a law of God, founded in
the very nature of things. Another can not eat for us,
can not drink for us; and, if we remain inactive while
another works for us, that other becomes healthy and
strong, enjoys both food and sleep; while we, on the
contrary, shrivel up, grow weak in body and in mind.</p>

<p>"Another may possess a knowledge of the laws of
life, and try to impart that knowledge to us; but if we
fail to learn, fail to act thereon, we can not enjoy the
benefits"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"That is just what we teach," interrupted Mrs. Vale:
"we must come to Christ, or we can not enjoy the benefits
of his salvation."</p>

<p>"You believe, if I understand you rightly," said
Porter, "that God, for the sake of Jesus, in virtue of
his sufferings and death, will forgive us our sins if we
ask him."</p>

<p>"Most assuredly I do: it is my only hope."</p>

<p>Mr. Porter turned to Mr. Vale: "I understand, sir,
that you are superintendent of the public schools in
this place?"</p>

<p>"I am," he replied.</p>

<p>"Did you ever have any one come and ask you for a
certificate that they were qualified to teach because their
brother had a splendid education, and had studied enough
for both?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not; but this is trifling, Mr. Porter."</p>

<!-- page 158 -->

<p>"I can not see it so, sir; and, for my part, I was never
more in earnest in my life. Study is a weariness to the
flesh; and, if we could have the benefits of an education
simply by confessing that we were lazy wretches depending
upon another to do the labor for us, I think there
would be but few who would do much studying."</p>

<p>"But the cases are not parallel at all," said Mrs. Vale.</p>

<p>"I think they are, madam: could you enjoy food
without the sense of taste?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>"And you must have that taste yourself, and not
another for you?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly."</p>

<p>"If you inhale the miasma of fever, can another be
sick for you, and you escape the suffering because that
other has not inhaled the poison, but still has been
sick?"</p>

<p>"I tell you, Mr. Porter, that I can not see the analogy
at all," replied Mrs. Vale.</p>

<p>"I can," said Alice. "Mr. Porter means to say that
heaven is not something that can be wrapped around us
like a garment, but that it must be wrought out through
the forces of our own being, even as the leaves, buds,
blossoms, and fruit of a tree are produced, wrought out
through the innate forces of the tree."</p>

<p>"You have the right idea, Mrs. Shepherd; for how
much good would it do a barren tree to have the credit
of another's fruitfulness imputed to it?"</p>

<p>"Not much, I am thinking," replied Alice laughing.
"And yet Christians talk of imputed righteousness, of
Christ our righteousness, of his obeying in our stead,
&amp;c, &amp;c. Now, I must confess that I can see no possibility

<!-- page 159 -->

for such a thing to be true. It is contrary to the
laws of nature; and, if God violates his own law, why
punish us for doing the same?"</p>

<p>Porter waited a moment for a reply, but none came.
Mr. and Mrs. Vale seemed as much surprised to meet
an independent thinker, one who dared to question what
others accepted, as they would have been had a thunder-clap
burst upon them from a cloudless sky.</p>

<p>"And then look at the influence of such a theory,"
he continued: "William Holten acknowledged himself
a seducer, a perjurer, and a murderer; he pursued his
wicked course up to within a few hours of his death,
stopping then only because he was forced to do so.
Nothing left for him in this world; and is it any wonder
that he should seize hold of any thing that afforded the
least pretext for hope in the next.</p>

<p>"It would be strange if he did not: and yet this is
called conversion; and the idea is held out that this man
has gone to heaven, to a state of perfect happiness.
What, I ask, is the influence of such an idea upon the
minds of the young?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you," said Alice. "Johnnie Shelton was
at play when we went home from the funeral; and, when
his father reproved him for breaking the sabbath, he
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>" 'I love to play, father; but I will get very sorry for
it before I die, and then it will all be right.' "</p>

<p>"Precisely that," said Porter; "and how can it be
otherwise when belief is put before acts; when a man
who has violated every law, human and divine, but who
claims to believe in Jesus,&mdash;when such a one is called
better than one who has tried to live according to the

<!-- page 160 -->

dictates of right, but who does not believe as the church
and the minister say is necessary?"</p>

<p>"I hardly think that this is so," said Mrs. Vale. "I
am sure that for my part I should prefer the latter to
the former for a neighbor."</p>

<p>"Individuals often hold in theory that which they
can not put into practice; but I have often heard it asserted,
both by minister and people, that a strictly moral
man, who trusted in his morality, was the very worst
man in the community; and your father, Mrs. Vale,
when expressing my opinion in the presence of Holten,
told me that I was the more wicked of the two. Poor
encouragement that to live right, if such as he is accounted
the best simply because of belief."</p>

<p>"But what can one do when situated like Holten?
There is nothing left to them but to believe; and shall
we deny them even the comfort of that? shall we tell
them that there is no hope?"</p>

<p>"No: I would not do that, Mrs. Vale. I would tell
them that God's laws were the same in all worlds; that
there was the same chance for improvement there as
here; and that only as he suffered the consequences of
his sins, thus learning the evil thereof, could he truly
hate to forsake them, and by a higher and better life
earn the rewards of such a life."</p>

<p>"Strange sentiments these, Mr. Porter: may I ask
you where you got hold of such ideas?" asked Mr.
Vale.</p>

<p>"I feel in my soul that God is just, and that he is
also love; and I can reconcile his love and justice in no
other way than by giving justice her full demands,&mdash;not
for the purpose of vengeance, but that we may be perfected

<!-- page 161 -->

thereby,&mdash;may be brought into a condition that
will admit of the blessings of his love."</p>

<p>"But justice demands the condemnation of the sinner,"
said Mrs. Vale.</p>

<p>"Yes, but not his eternal condemnation," replied
Porter: "only to the utmost farthing; and how can a
finite being contract an infinite debt?"</p>

<p>"Does not man sin against an Infinite Being, Mr.
Porter?"</p>

<p>"No: he sins against himself; and help must come
from within, not from without."</p>

<p>"How do you show that?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"From the book of nature: if I burn my hand, the
recupurating power is in the body, not outside of it. If
I break my limb, it is the same: in both instances I have
violated the law of my physical being, and must suffer
the consequences, and suffer them for myself too: but I
do not suffer as long with a slight burn as with a broken
limb; and I believe that it is the same with the moral as
with the physical, with the soul as with the body. It
seems to me just as impossible to escape the consequences
of a broken moral law as of a broken physical
law,&mdash;as of a broken limb."</p>

<p>"No forgiveness of sin!" exclaimed Mrs. Vale.</p>

<p>"No forgiveness of sin," replied Porter.</p>

<p>"God help us, then!" she ejaculated.</p>

<p>"God helps those who help themselves, dear lady;
and, 'Work out your own salvation; for it is God that
worketh in you, both to will and to do,' is a favorite
text of mine,&mdash;the God within, not the God without;
God all and in all blessed for evermore."</p>

<p>Mr. Vale and his wife seemed astonished to hear such

<!-- page 162 -->

tones of reverence from one who was such an infidel,
as they counted infidelity; but Alice seemed like one endowed
with new life, as she listened to the reasoning of
the earnest-hearted young man.</p>

<p>"God's ways are wonderful," she said; "and, unless
we recognize him as all and in all, as directing all
things in wisdom, we are lost in the labyrinth of an
uncertainty that too often leads to the gulf of despair."</p>

<p>"Do you think deception is ever justifiable, even for
the sake of self-defense?" asked Mrs. Vale, as if to
change the subject.</p>

<p>Porter flushed. "Do you mean to ask me if I think
I did right in deceiving Holten, and thereby preventing
the consummation of his plans, Mrs. Vale?"</p>

<p>"I did not intend to be personal," she replied, "for
this may be among the theories that we are too weak to
put into practice; but, taking the strict sense of the command,
'Thou shalt not lie,' is it right in any case to
practice deception?"</p>

<p>"I am not partial to either gnats or camels," said
Porter impatiently; while Alice added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was certainly a good thing for me, Mr. Porter,
that you took the course you did: otherwise I tremble to
think what might have been my fate."</p>

<p>"And the consciousness of having been of use to you,
Mrs. Shepherd, is reward enough to compensate for a
great deal of suffering," he replied in a tone that brought
the blood to Alice's cheek.</p>

<p>"I have thought of it so often since," she continued:
"how strange it was that retribution for the wrongs of
one should prove such a blessing to another!"</p>

<p>"The law of compensation, Mrs. Shepherd,&mdash;compensation

<!-- page 163 -->

to her and me too; for I have no doubt that
my darling sister rejoices with me in your safety."</p>

<p>"I know now," said Mr. Vale, "where you got your
ideas, Porter. You are more than half Spiritualist."</p>

<p>"Altogether one, Mr. Vale; that is, so far as I understand
their views."</p>

<p>"And do you really believe that the dead can come
back, Mr. Porter?"</p>

<p>"I do, sir; and I further believe that my sister assisted
me in penetrating Holten's disguise."</p>

<p>"Nonsense: we shall have to send you and Alice
both to the insane asylum."</p>

<p>"I am sure I shall not object to my company if we
can go together," replied Porter smiling.</p>

<p>"By the way, we have a medium (I believe that is
what you call them) here; and her house is thronged,
so people say. Suppose we all go to see her some time."</p>

<p>"O husband!" exclaimed Mrs. Vale, "you certainly
will not go there?"</p>

<p>"Why not, wife? how can we prove a thing unless
we investigate it? and we are commanded to prove all
things."</p>

<p>"But we must not put ourselves in the power of the
Devil if we want God's protection."</p>

<p>"If it is the Devil's work, so much the more need
that good people should investigate and expose it; and,
if God will not protect his children in exposing that
which is evil, how can we trust him in any thing? I,
for one, am going to find out for myself: who will go
with me?"</p>

<p>"I will," said Alice. "And I, too," said Porter:
then, turning to Mrs. Vale, he added,&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 164 -->

<p>"Come, madam, I think you had better go: perhaps
we three can keep the Devil from catching you;
and, if we leave you here all alone, he might possibly
slip around and get the advantage of you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Vale laughed in spite of herself, and finally concluded
that she would go if the rest did. And so it
was decided that they should attend a circle.</p>

<!-- page 165 -->

<div class="center" id="XIII">

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p class="small">THE CIRCLE.</p>

</div>

<p>MR. PORTER thought it best to carry out
the suggestion of attending a circle before
objections could be brought forward by
interested parties to prevent it: so he
called upon the medium the next day, and
obtained permission to be present at their next meeting,
which was on the following evening.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vale demurred somewhat when the hour came,
but finally went with the others. And here we are
again, gentle reader, in the circle-room. Things look
somewhat familiar; for it is in the same room, the same
medium, and nearly the same company, that we met before.
The honest-hearted gentleman, whose barns were
burned, is not present; neither is the young man who
recognized Bob Perigrene: but the gentleman who gave
a false name has returned, and waits the fulfillment of
the promise then made him. The members of the circle
are the same, and only our company are new to the
place.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vale watches things with a sort of fearful interest,&mdash;interested
in spite of her determination not to
be, and fearful lest she should see a cloven foot somewhere.</p>

<p>The members of the circle took their places, our party

<!-- page 166 -->

and the gentleman before spoken of remaining upon the
outside. The words commencing,&mdash;</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="center">"Come, Holy Spirit, Heavenly Dove,"&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>were sung; the leader of the circle remarking that we
needed, not only one, but many, holy spirits to watch
over us, and then giving a short invocation, the burden
of which was, that, while both needing and desiring the
protection of good spirits, he implored a sufficiency of
the sweet charity that would receive and try to benefit
all who came. A few moments' silence, and the medium
was controlled.</p>

<p>Again that fair young form took on the semblance of
a little weazen-faced old man; again the movements of
shoe-making were gone through with; while the metamorphosed
form nodded, smiled, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How do you do, good friends? Hard at work, as
you see; but honesty and industry are indispensable to
success,&mdash;indispensable, good friends, or I had never
gone from the shoemaker's bench to a place in the councils
of my country."</p>

<p>"Here is Bob Perigrene again, pretending to be
Roger Sherman," remarked one of the circle.</p>

<p>"My name is Robert, not Bob; and I would thank
you, sir, to call me Mr. Perigrene."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Mr. Perigrene: I acknowledge my
fault; for all should be treated with respect, especially
if we wish to benefit them."</p>

<p>"Benefit them! Do you intend that as an insinuation,
sir?"</p>

<p>"An insinuation?"</p>

<!-- page 167 -->

<p>"Yes: it looks as though you thought I needed benefiting."</p>

<p>"Well, don't you?"</p>

<p>"No: I am well enough off."</p>

<p>"The best of us can be made better, Mr. Perigrene."</p>

<p>"True, true: I don't think much of those saints who
imagine that they are so much better than other people."</p>

<p>"Who is it that thinks so?"</p>

<p>"It looks as if you did when you talk of benefiting
me, Mr. Mentor."</p>

<p>"Not at all, Mr. Perigrene, not at all; for I presume
you could benefit me, and I am certain that you could
benefit yourself."</p>

<p>"Just tell me how, will you, Mr. Consequence?"</p>

<p>"You are not giving me my right name in either case,
sir; but I will answer your question. You can benefit
yourself very much by learning to be truthful."</p>

<p>"An insult, an insult, Mr. Impudence! If I only had
my old body, I would thrash you for that. Truthful,
indeed! Pray, when have I been otherwise?"</p>

<p>"You have come to this circle twice now, and pretended,
either directly or indirectly, to be Roger Sherman;
which you know is false."</p>

<p>"Well, it's in me; and I think I have as good a right
to tell a lie as my neighbor there," said he, pointing to
the stranger with a false name.</p>

<p>"Come, husband, let us go home," said Mrs. Vale,
at this point. "They are lying spirits, by their own
confession; and I don't think it right to encourage them
by our presence."</p>

<p>"If you go, you will have to go alone," was the reply;
"for I am going to see the play out, now I am
here."</p>

<!-- page 168 -->

<p>"Look," said Porter: "the influence is changing:
we shall have something different now."</p>

<p>"Something better, I hope," was Mrs. Vale's impatient
response; and then, as her eye turned in that
direction, "Look at Alice, will you?"</p>

<p>"Alice, what is it? your face is radiant."</p>

<p>"Wait, uncle," was her only response.</p>

<p>Presently the medium turned slowly toward her, extended
a hand, and said, "Miss Alice, is it not as I told
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Peter, it is," she replied.</p>

<p>"Call me Pete, please: it makes me feel more as if
we were back in that little village, or rambling in the
woods, or by the streams around it."</p>

<p>"Yes, Pete: those were happy days; but dark, dark
ones have been mine since then."</p>

<p>"Did I not tell you of the cloud, Miss Alice? I saw
that it must come, and it has,&mdash;a cloud so dense, that no
light but that from our side of the river could penetrate
it."</p>

<p>"True; and thank God with me that such a light was
permitted to shine upon me. And the other part of your
prophecy was true, too, Pete; for I have seen you, and
now I hear your voice once more. You said that I
should see and hear."</p>

<p>"Yes; but you can not hold those blessings for yourself
alone, Miss Alice. You have a work to do,&mdash;one
which will bring a storm about your ears."</p>

<p>"A storm?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Before it was a cloud; now it will be a storm."</p>

<p>"Well, let it come: it can not put out the lamp I carry
now. Is your mother with you, Pete?"</p>

<!-- page 169 -->

<p>"She is, and she tells me that my father is here present
to-night."</p>

<p>"Your father!" exclaimed the stranger gentleman.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir: she tells me that you are my father."</p>

<p>"Tis false!" he vociferated, springing to his feet;
"all false. I thought it was from the Devil; and I know
it is now, for I never had a son."</p>

<p>The influence changed almost instantaneously; and
a voice of peculiar sweetness said, "Philip, have you
forgotten your Vermont trip, and the poor girl whom
you trapped into a false marriage?"</p>

<p>The irate man sank back into his seat, with pallid
cheek and quaking limbs. "Who speaks? whose voice
is that?" he asked, in tones which showed that he was
touched to the soul.</p>

<p>"It is I,&mdash;Marion Sloan; and he who has just spoken
is your own son. You have given a false name here, and
you gave me a false name then; that is, the last name:
your true one is Maldren,&mdash;Philip Maldren."</p>

<p>"This is psychology,&mdash;mind-reading: there are no
spirits in the case; and those who claim that there are,
are humbugs," said Mr. Maldren, who, having recovered
his self-possession, seemed determined to contend
to the end.</p>

<p>"Have we not given you your true name?"</p>

<p>"You have; but you read it from my mind."</p>

<p>"Did you not tell us, when here before, that you
would believe if we could tell you what your name
was?"</p>

<p>"True; but I did not think then of the time you
would have to trace it out. It has been months since,&mdash;long
enough to learn my whole history: had you told
me then, it would have been different."</p>

<!-- page 170 -->

<p>"Did you leave any clew, by means of which we could
do this?"</p>

<p>"No: I took good care of that; but I tell you that
you took it from my mind."</p>

<p>"You were wont to take good care, Philip. You
have been accustomed all your life to covering your
tracks; but there are eyes that can penetrate all disguises.
I was not the first one that you deceived and
betrayed: you have another son here."</p>

<p>"Indeed! you will make me a man of family pretty
soon. Perhaps you can tell me the name of this other
victim?"</p>

<p>"I can: it was Maria Holten; and she called her son
William."</p>

<p>Here Vale and his wife gave each other glances of
astonishment; while the controlling spirit continued,
"Did I take that from your mind, Philip?"</p>

<p>"No; for I had forgotten it."</p>

<p>"You acknowledge its truth then?"</p>

<p>"I don't see as that follows."</p>

<p>"How could you forget that which you never knew?"</p>

<p>"Well, well, have your own way about it," said Maldren;
for his bold bearing was fast giving way to the
pallidness of guilt and fear: "but where is she now,&mdash;this
Maria of whom you speak?"</p>

<p>"Where she never would have been but for you,
Philip,&mdash;the keeper of an assignation in &mdash;&mdash; Street,
New York. You start; and well you may, for you were
there the last time you were in the city. You did not
recognize her; but she knew you, and would have murdered
you but for my influence. You remember the
circumstances: it is not necessary for me to enter into
details."</p>

<!-- page 171 -->

<p>"O my God!" groaned the unhappy man: "it is all
too true; but I never thought to meet these things till
the judgment-day."</p>

<p>"No uncommon mistake, Philip: there were those
in the days of Jesus who thought they were tormented
before their time."</p>

<p>"O Marion!" said he, "and did you indeed watch
over me for good?"</p>

<p>"I did, Philip, and have for years done all that I
could to restrain you from evil, and lead you to the
right."</p>

<p>The attention of the company had been so taken up,
that they did not notice the change coming over Alice;
consequently were somewhat startled to hear a heavy
bass voice say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"For years I have striven to get possession of this
body; received my death-wound in my last earthly attempt,
but I have succeeded at last. Yes: I have succeeded;
but oh, under what different circumstances from
what I anticipated or desired!" Then turning to Maldren,
he&mdash;for you have already recognized William
Holten&mdash;continued, "The lady may watch over you
for good; but I will"&mdash;&mdash; the medium's hand was quickly
placed upon Alice's lips; and she who had called herself
Marion Sloan said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, no, William: you must not curse him; for, in so
doing, you will only injure yourself."</p>

<p>"And what if I do, lady? I can not be much worse
off than I am."</p>

<p>"But you can be better off if you desire it."</p>

<p>"How, pray?"</p>

<p>"By returning good for evil; by striving to benefit
others, even those who have wronged you the most."</p>

<!-- page 172 -->

<p>"Do you imagine, lady, that wrongs such as he has
committed can ever be forgiven? Only think what my
life has been, and all through him."</p>

<p>"I was not talking of forgiveness in any such sense
as to do away with the consequences of his acts. It is
because he must suffer these consequences,&mdash;because
he can not escape them,&mdash;that I ask for him your pity
and kind feeling. I also ask it for your own sake, because
it will be better for you," was the reply.</p>

<p>Maldren looked and listened with an expression of
the keenest anguish upon his countenance. And was
this indeed the Marion that he had so deeply wronged?
Had she really come from the land of the blessed to
plead for him? Such were the thoughts of this wretched
man; while William Holten, still controlling the form
of Alice, laughed in derision at the gentle counselings
of the pure spirit who sought to lead him upward.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" he exclaimed: "wouldn't I look well
now, in trying to benefit the man who ruined my mother,
and left me a waif upon the world's mercy?"</p>

<p>"And have not you wronged others?" asked the
spirit.</p>

<p>"It is his fault if I have," was the reply.</p>

<p>"In one sense it was, William; and in another sense
it was your own fault. There was a cause for his doing
as he did, as well as for your doing as you did."</p>

<p>"I don't care if there was: I'll have my revenge,
and upon you too," turning to Porter. "You deceived
and betrayed me, and I'll make you suffer for it yet."</p>

<p>Mrs. Vale had watched Alice during the above colloquy,
with a half-frightened, half-horrified look, till,
unable to contain her feelings longer, she begged her
husband to take her home.</p>

<!-- page 173 -->

<p>"It is the Devil: I am sure it is the Devil," she said;
"and he takes this course to make us believe that the
blood of Christ is not sufficient for us. William Holten
died trusting in Jesus; and I am certain he would not
be here talking in this way."</p>

<p>"It's the Devil, is it? You want to go home, do
you?" said the one claiming to be William, turning
fiercely toward her; while the influence controlling the
regular medium changed very quickly, and a voice full
of solemn warning said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Madam, you are right: these influences come from
the Devil and his angels. I, Paul, the servant of Jesus
Christ, am mercifully permitted to tell you this, to the
end that you may be without excuse if you have further
to do with this wickedness."</p>

<p>The spirit controlling Alice looked up as if surprised,
and then, giving expression to a hearty laugh, left;
while Alice, with a bewildered air, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Strange that I should go to sleep."</p>

<p>"Not asleep, but under the influence of an evil spirit,
madam," said the one claiming to be Paul; and then,
turning to the company, he continued, "You see, beloved,
how soon these vile spirits fly when one of God's
commissioned ones appears."</p>

<p>Mrs. Vale now insisted upon going, and her husband
went with her. Alice refused to leave, however, till
the circle closed; and Porter remained also. Mr. and
Mrs. Vale had no sooner left the room than the dignified,
devout Paul changed his base entirely. The face
of the medium broadened and shortened considerably,
while the eyes twinkled with mischief, or, rather, the
muscles around the eyes, for the latter were closed.</p>

<!-- page 174 -->

<p>"Well, wasn't that well done?" was uttered in tones
of triumph.</p>

<p>"Wasn't what well done?" asked Porter.</p>

<p>"Making that woman believe it was the Devil. Ha,
ha!"</p>

<p>"And why did you do that?" continued Porter.</p>

<p>"Why, the poor woman was hunting for a devil, and
I thought I would help her to find one. Doesn't the
Book say that we must help such as want help, and be
kind?"</p>

<p>"It says something to that effect; but you are perverting
its meaning, and wronging others at the same
time."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"It will make trouble for this lady, who is staying
with them, as it will only intensify their opposition."</p>

<p>"I can't help that: I answered her according to her
folly. What I said came through the same channel as
did the good advice to William Holten; and if she
chooses to think that my lies were from God, and
Marion Sloan's truth from the Devil, why, let her have
her own choice. People generally get what they are
looking for: she was looking for a devil, and she got
some d&mdash;&mdash;lish lies."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut!" said Porter: "that's rather rough."</p>

<p>"Well, I was a rough, jolly sort of a fellow when I
was here, and I haven't got polished yet; shall, though,
in good time,&mdash;that is, if I don't meet too many like
her; but, when I see such folly, it arouses all my old
spirit of mischief, and I do love to play off upon them."</p>

<p>"Will you not tell us who you really are?" asked
Alice.</p>

<!-- page 175 -->

<p>"One who will never harm you, lady: as to my
name, it can make no difference if you do not know it;
but you may call me Jack, for short, and so good-night."</p>

<p>As there was no further manifestation, the circle was
closed; and each, as they went to their homes, pondered
in their hearts as to what these things meant.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p class="small">CONSULTATION.</p>

</div>

<p>UPON leaving the circle, Mr. and Mrs.
Vale walked on a while in silence. It
was at length broken by Mr. Vale's saying,
"This will never do, wife."</p>

<p>"I thought you would be sorry: I wish
we had not gone," she replied.</p>

<p>"But I am not sorry: I am glad we went," said he;
"for it will help us to avoid what might otherwise have
occurred."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Mr. Vale?" asked the lady in
accents of surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, in reference to Alice. Don't you see that she
is a medium too; and, in her present state of mind, she
can be easily influenced to do what she otherwise would
not? Porter is really a believer in these things; is enthusiastic
in what he undertakes; and he, together with
the medium, will try to make Alice think that she must
devote herself to the cause."</p>

<p>"Oh, I never thought of that! I would not have
her do it for the world!" exclaimed Mrs. Vale.</p>

<p>"Neither would I," he replied; "for, in the rebound
of her mind from the extreme of grief in which she has
been plunged, she would be sure to go to the opposite
extreme, and perhaps become really insane."</p>

<!-- page 177 -->

<p>"I hardly think there would be any danger of that;
but only think of the disgrace of having a relative of
ours, a member of our family, take such a course. To
be insane on another subject would not be so bad as being
sane on this; for the first would be looked upon as a
misfortune only, but the latter is infamous."</p>

<p>"Well, wife, we see the danger now, as we should
not have done had we not visited the circle to-night;
and we must take steps to prevent such a catastrophe.
I love Alice as if she were my own sister; and it shall
be no fault of mine if she is not saved from this new
danger."</p>

<p>"But how? What course shall we take?"</p>

<p>"I can not tell as yet; but something must be done,
and one thing is certain: we must not seem to oppose
her, not strongly at least, or she will call it the storm
that Pete spoke of, and it will only make her the more
determined. Your father will be here in the course of
the week, and we will consult him as to the course to be
taken."</p>

<p>"I was surprised at you, James, when you consented
to go to such a place; but now I see that there was a
purpose in it. The Bible says that 'The hearts of the
children of men are in the hands of the Lord; and he
turneth them like rivers of water, whithersoever he
will;' and I think it has been so in this case. O James!
I wish you were indeed a Christian."</p>

<p>"And so I shall be, little wife, when the Lord turns
my heart in that direction," he replied, half in jest, and
half in earnest.</p>

<p>"O husband! now you are making fun of the

<!-- page 178 -->

Bible," she said, with an earnestness that brought tears
to her own eyes, if not to his.</p>

<p>"Indeed I am not, wife; but I must confess that I can
not quite understand the theories that you church people
advocate,&mdash;some of them at least."</p>

<p>"Not theories, Mr. Vale; not theories, but truths."</p>

<p>"Well, truths, then, but truths that are only theoretical
with a large proportion of those who profess to
understand and accept them; for I see but very little of
the practical results."</p>

<p>They had now reached their own door; and the honest
little woman made no further reply, but only offered
up a silent prayer that God would indeed turn the heart
of her husband in the right direction.</p>

<p>When the nurse had been summoned, and the little
one duly kissed and caressed, Mrs. Vale said, "Shall we
sit up for Alice and Porter?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly," was the reply; "for Alice feels
that she owes more than life to Porter. It will not do
to treat him rudely; but we must give them no more
opportunity for conversation than we can help, and get
her from under his influence as soon as possible. But
here they come: now, keep cool, wife: be careful what
you say, and how you say it; for, if Alice once gets an
idea that we are working to break up this thing, we can
do nothing with her."</p>

<p>"Not gone to bed yet?" said Alice as they came in.</p>

<p>"No," replied Mr. Vale, "but were just talking of
it. I thought, though, that we would wait a little, and
learn what further manifestations you had."</p>

<p>"O chameleon-hued Curiosity!" said Porter, laughing,
"verily, thy forms are legion: want to learn what

<!-- page 179 -->

happened after you left? Don't think you deserve to
know after running off as you did."</p>

<p>"You must blame Mrs. Vale for that: I would have
staid had she been willing."</p>

<p>"Eve did it," cried Alice. "Now, aunt, I would not
put up with that if I were you; for I believe that that
solemn-faced admonition frightened him as badly as it
did you."</p>

<p>"Hush, Alice! don't speak so lightly upon so solemn
a subject," said Mrs. Vale.</p>

<p>Alice looked into her aunt's face, and, catching its
awed expression, was fairly convulsed with laughter
when she remembered the cause of it. "Excuse me,
aunt," said she, as soon as she could speak; "but, could
you have seen the ending of the quondam Paul's solemn
farce, I am sure that you would feel differently from
what you do."</p>

<p>"Why do you speak thus, Alice? What evidence
have you that it was not Paul?" said Mrs. Vale in a
tone which showed that she had the same human nature
as others, even if, according to her idea, she had been
born again.</p>

<p>"Just like the rest of us," said Porter: "don't want
that proved false which we desire to be true; but come
now, Mrs. Vale, let us lay aside prejudice, and decide
in accordance with the evidence."</p>

<p>"I shall not stop to argue with you, Mr. Porter: the
Bible forbids us to have any thing to do with familiar
spirits, and that is enough for me."</p>

<p>"Why, then, was Paul sent to you, Mrs. Vale?"
asked he, with a merry twinkle of the eye.</p>

<p>"I see that you do not believe it was Paul," she replied;

<!-- page 180 -->

"but what was claimed to have come from William
Holten, that was all right, of course."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vale, you mistake me entirely," said Porter.
"In the first place, the fact that a spirit claims to be or
not to be a certain person does not prove that it is so,&mdash;that
they tell the truth. Still, if there is no opposing
evidence, we accept their testimony, unless there is that
in the very nature of the case which is calculated to do
us an injury. If a spirit tells me to be good and true,
to live a pure and progressive life, I accept his teachings,
no matter who it is from. It is what, not who.
On the contrary, if one who claims to be Paul, Peter,
Isaiah, or any one else, tells me to do that which I feel
to be wrong, I should reject the teaching, no matter if
it was proven to have come from the person claimed."</p>

<p>"I don't believe in doing evil that good may
come."</p>

<p>"Neither do I, madam."</p>

<p>"Why, then, have any thing to do with these things?
What do they add to what we already know? and, if
violating a plain command under pretense that good
may come is not doing evil, I don't know what is," said
Mrs. Vale in a tone which showed that she thought her
position impregnable.</p>

<p>"Why have any thing to do with these things? because
they come to us as a manifestation of God's providence,
demanding our attention. In the burning-bush
of life's intensity they find their place, and we hear
God's voice therein; and, as to adding to what we already
know, they are among the cloud of witnesses
who demonstrate eternal life, are of the innumerable
company of angels that Paul speaks of, are of the just

<!-- page 181 -->

made perfect, and also of the spirits in prison that the
Christ of love is ever ready to receive and benefit."</p>

<p>"But what do you do with God's command?" persisted
Mrs. Vale.</p>

<p>"What command?" asked Porter.</p>

<p>"The one given through Moses."</p>

<p>"To whom was it given?"</p>

<p>"To the children of Israel, of course."</p>

<p>"Moses did, so we are told, give such a command to
those under his control. But we have no proof, except
his word, that God told him to give it; and, further, we
are not Israelites."</p>

<p>"God gives his commands to one age for all time,
and to one people for all people; and you have shown
yourself an infidel by your own admission. You do
not believe the Bible, Mr. Porter?"</p>

<p>"If God's commands to one people are for all people,
why do you eat pork, Mrs. Vale? The command that
the Jews should not eat pork is just as emphatic as in
the other case."</p>

<p>"Come, come, wife, this is all nonsense: you and
Mr. Porter might talk all night, and you wouldn't
agree."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Vale, for reminding me of the
hour," said Porter; "for I must leave early in the
morning, and shall need some sleep."</p>

<p>"How long will you be absent?" asked Vale, in a
tone so interested that Alice noticed it, and understood
it afterward; but it puzzled her at the time.</p>

<p>"About a month, I think; but I hope to find you all
here, and all well and happy, when I return; so good-night."</p>

<!-- page 182 -->

<p>Alice retired immediately; for the experience of the
evening had placed her in a frame of mind that required
solitude,&mdash;solitude and reflection, for her soul was too
deeply stirred for sleep.</p>

<p>"That takes one difficulty out of our path," said
Vale to his wife, as soon as Alice had left the room.
Mrs. Vale looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Porter's going away," he continued. "We could
hardly do any thing toward removing Alice while he
was here; for he would be certain to find some means
of preventing it."</p>

<p>"I am glad he is going," said Mrs. Vale; "for he is
really a very dangerous man. Why is it, husband, that
those who hold such ruinous sentiments are generally
so correct in their lives as far as acts are concerned?"</p>

<p>"Because they trust in works, of course: I should
not think that you would need to ask that, wife."</p>

<p>"True, true,&mdash;works, self-righteousness."</p>

<p>"And then there is the stealing of the livery of the
court of heaven to serve the Devil in."</p>

<p>"Yes; but why should trusting in works lead to a
more correct life than trusting in Jesus?" said she, with
a puzzled expression upon her face.</p>

<p>Mr. Vale regarded her for a moment with a half-serious,
half-amused look. "Look out, little wife," said
he, "or you will ask one question too many, and thus
find yourself doubting before you know it."</p>

<p>She colored, sighed, and said no more; but she could
not stop thinking.</p>

<p>"A storm?" said Alice to herself, after she had retired,
"a storm? I wonder what kind of one."</p>

<p>A voice from the unseen seemed to reply, "Not so

<!-- page 183 -->

properly a storm as a prison where the sun is reflected
from ice,&mdash;a something that will inclose you for a season,
but will give you no warmth."</p>

<p>"And can you not save me from this?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Were it best, we could," was the response.</p>

<p>For a moment her soul shrank from the coming ordeal;
but when she remembered that the angel side of
her life could not be inclosed, that light and warmth
from the summer land would still be hers, she grew
strong again to do and to bear, and, laying her head
upon her pillow, slept as sweetly as an infant on its
mother's breast.</p>

<p>The next morning, at the breakfast-table, the conversation
naturally turned upon what had occurred the
previous evening; and Mrs. Vale said to Alice, "Your
uncle thinks that you will turn medium yet."</p>

<p>"And why not?" she asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Why not! and would you really do such a thing,
Alice?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me a blessed mission," she replied.</p>

<p>"I would rather see you dead," said Mrs. Vale, forgetting,
in her excitement, the caution her husband had
given her the night before.</p>

<p>"There, there, wife, don't run to meet trouble:
Alice has been separated from her uncle too many years
to want to leave him in a hurry," said Mr. Vale, giving
his wife a meaning look.</p>

<p>Alice laughed. "You flatter yourself, uncle," said
she.</p>

<p>"I think not," was the reply. "I only feel that you
would be as unwilling to give me up as I would you.
Why, puss, we haven't half lived over our childhood's
days yet."</p>

<!-- page 184 -->

<p>"Don't you two be saying too many sweet things, or
I shall be jealous," said Mrs. Vale merrily.</p>

<p>"Please don't be so cruel, and I will be good, aunt,"
said Alice, with a pretty pout upon her lip. "I couldn't
bear that, indeed, I could not; but I can't see as I am
to blame after all, for it was not me that said the sweet
things."</p>

<p>"Adam did it instead of Eve: eh, Alice?" retorted
Mr. Vale.</p>

<p>Little Alice came in at this moment for her share of
attention, and there was nothing further said upon the
subject.</p>

<p>The next day, Alice visited the medium again; and,
while she was absent, Mr. Shelton came. His daughter
hastened to consult him in reference to the subject that
was troubling her.</p>

<p>"It will never do to let this go on," said he, after listening
to her story: "something must be done, and
that is certain."</p>

<p>"Yes: but what? it will be worse than useless to
talk to her."</p>

<p>"Of course: insane people never listen to reason."</p>

<p>"And do you really think her insane, father?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; though not so as to be noticed, except
by a close observer. Perhaps monomania would be the
most proper term: all right except upon some particular
subjects. But an asylum is the best place for her: indeed,
it is the only thing that will save her."</p>

<p>"O father!" exclaimed Mrs. Vale.</p>

<p>"I know it seems hard, my child; but the end justifies
the means. It can be done very quietly,&mdash;so quietly
that the public will be none the wiser."</p>

<!-- page 185 -->

<p>"But where can we take her, father?"</p>

<p>"I have a friend who is a physician, and a man of
deep piety, who has had some experience in these matters.
He had a lovely daughter who came under the
influence of these modern witches; and he was obliged
to shut her up to keep her from them. She proved incurable,
and died in about six months. This almost
broke his heart; and, in the bitterness of his grief, he resolved
to spend his life in trying to save others from this
terrible delusion: so he fitted up his house and grounds
as a private asylum."</p>

<p>"And has he been successful in curing those placed
under his charge?"</p>

<p>"Not as much so as he could wish: but you see, my
child, that it prevents the poison from spreading; and it
saves the families with whom the unfortunate ones are
connected from the disgrace of their going before the
public, as they are sure to imagine that they must."</p>

<p>"I see," said Mrs. Vale thoughtfully; "and this is
where you would advise us to take Alice?"</p>

<p>"It is, and the very best place I can think of."</p>

<p>"Well, I will talk with Mr. Vale about it; but it
seems hard."</p>

<p>"You ought to have learned before this, my daughter,
that it is often hard to do right: duty and pleasure do
not often walk the same paths in this life."</p>

<p>"It is not the doing of the right, but the knowing as
to what is right, that troubles me," she replied.</p>

<p>"Ask God to help you: you do not pray enough, I
fear."</p>

<p>"I suppose I am wicked, father: it must be so, though
I am sure I don't wish to do wrong. Still, when I pray,

<!-- page 186 -->

I sometimes find it so dark that I feel that I can never
make the attempt again."</p>

<p class="small">" 'The hosts of hell are pressing hard<br/>

To draw you from the skies.'</p>

<p>"I fear that you have an idol somewhere,&mdash;something
that you think more of than you do of your God. He
is a jealous God, and will permit nothing of the kind:
be careful that he does not take your husband or your
child from you."</p>

<p>"And do you think, Mr. Shelton, that such a loss
would have a tendency to make her love him any
better?" asked Alice, who had come up just in time to
hear the last sentence or two.</p>

<p>They both started, and looked so uneasily toward her,
that Alice saw they had been talking of something that
they did not wish her to hear; so she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Indeed, I have not been eaves-dropping. I came
up just in time to hear Mr. Shelton's last remarks; and
it seemed such a strange way for God to take to make
us love him, that I could not well avoid speaking as I
did."</p>

<p>"God's ways are past finding out; and we are presumptious
to question," said Mr. Shelton solemnly.</p>

<p>That night, after Alice had retired, the subject was
well canvassed in family conclave, and it was fully decided
that Alice should be sent to Dr. Denning's.</p>

<p>"You will have to be very cautious," said Mr. Shelton,
"or she will mistrust that something is going on, and
refuse to go: these insane people seem sometimes to
read one's very thoughts."</p>

<!-- page 187 -->

<p>"And that," said Mrs. Vale, "is what makes me
believe that it is their own peculiar sensitiveness, and
not spirits, that makes them see and talk as they do.
They become the mirror, as it were, to reflect the
thoughts and feelings of the circle. If it was really as
they pretend,&mdash;if it was really a spirit that Alice saw
the other night, then it could warn her and defeat our
plans in spite of our efforts to the contrary."</p>

<p>"If He be the King of the Jews, let him save himself,"
said Mr. Vale.</p>

<p>"Why do you quote these words?" asked his wife
in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Because of the parallel in the mode of reasoning,"
he replied.</p>

<p>"James," said Mr. Shelton, in a tone of severity, "I
very much fear that your spirit of reckless trifling will
yet place you beyond the pale of hope and mercy."</p>

<p>"But I can not see the parallel," said Mrs. Vale.</p>

<p>"Neither is it best that you should," said her father:
"this comparing sacred things with profane, Jesus with
the claims of Spiritualists, is simply blasphemous."</p>

<p>"Are not the rules of logic and reason applicable in
one case as well as in the other, father?" said Mr. Vale,
with a look of perplexity upon his features.</p>

<p>"That, James, is the trouble with this age,&mdash;too
much reason, and too little Bible. As though God's
works, the laws of matter and mind, could be used to
set aside his word."</p>

<p>"I stand rebuked," said Mr. Vale, "but I must confess
that I can not see for what."</p>

<p>"God help you, my son, to find the true light."</p>

<p>"Amen," was the response; "but when shall our
plans respecting Alice be put into execution?"</p>

<!-- page 188 -->

<p>"As soon as possible: present duty should never be
neglected; but perhaps you had better not move in the
matter till after I am gone. She seems to have an
instinctive aversion to me, and might object to going if
she suspected that I had any thing to do with it."</p>

<p>"I was in hopes that you could go with us, father."</p>

<p>"No, child: it will not be best. I can give you and
James the necessary directions, and a letter of introduction;
but don't let her know but what you are old
acquaintances."</p>

<p>"Then I must send the letter of introduction through
the mail, explaining my reasons for doing so, and so
describe our appearance and time of coming that he
will recognize us upon sight; for, if Alice should discover
that there had been the least deception practiced,
we should have trouble with her, and it will be hard
enough to leave her there without any thing of that
kind."</p>

<p>"Your suggestion is a good one, James. Give me
pen, ink, and paper, and I will write what is necessary
now. Nothing like doing a thing promptly."</p>

<p>About a week after this, while at the breakfast table
one morning, Mr. Vale said to Alice, "I presume that
you will be very lonely till Porter returns: what say
you to a trip with us to visit some friends?"</p>

<p>"To convince you, uncle, that I am not so dependent
upon Mr. Porter for my happiness, as you may
suppose, I move that I keep house, and let you and
aunt go and enjoy yourselves at your leisure."</p>

<p>"Worse and worse: leave you here to dream of him
from morning till night. No, no, that will never do:
you must go with us, or we stay."</p>

<!-- page 189 -->

<p>"Nonsense," she replied: "I will go of course,
rather than keep you at home. I only said that to
show you that I could live without Mr. Porter, and you,
too, if necessary."</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Independence, be ready, then, early to-morrow
morning: for it is a good day's drive, further
than I ought to go in one day; and we can not possibly
get through before dark."</p>

<p>"But you have not told me where you were going,
uncle."</p>

<p>"To Clinton, or near there. It is some ten miles
from &mdash;&mdash; River, and our road lies through the finest
portion of the State."</p>

<p>"A relative?" said Alice.</p>

<p>"Not exactly, or at least so distant that we claim
nothing on that score. I believe his wife is a little
related to Mother Shelton."</p>

<p>The next morning early, they were on their way,
but did not reach the doctor's establishment till very
late; consequently Alice saw nothing to arouse her suspicions.
She slept late the next morning; and, when
she arose, Uncle James and his wife were gone.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to portray her feelings, for I have
neither the power nor the disposition to do so: but, in
the weary days and too often wakeful nights that followed,
there was compensation; for she had soul-food of
which they knew nothing, companionship that their eyes
were too dull to perceive.</p>

</div>

<p>WE will now return to Ellsville, and inquire
after our old friends, the Winchesters.
Have they forgotten Alice Vale
and the kindness that she showed them
years before?</p>

<p>Addie could never forget, whoever else might; and,
from the time that John Shepherd had been condemned
to prison till now, her heart had gone out in one continued
longing for the happiness of her stricken friend,
in continued desire that in some way she might be able
to pay a portion at least of the mighty debt of gratitude
that swelled her soul.</p>

<p>"I wonder where Alice is to-night," said she to her
husband one pleasant evening, as they sat around the
family board.</p>

<p>"I am sure I can not tell: somewhere in the West
though, as I am told that she went home with her
father's brother a few months since," was Mr. Winchester's
reply.</p>

<p>"From whom did you learn that?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I had a letter from a friend of Mr. Dare's, in which
this fact was mentioned. I thought I had told you."</p>

<p>"This is the first that I have heard of it, Edward."</p>

<!-- page 191 -->

<p>"Strange that I should have forgotten it; but I
know now why I did, wife: it was on the morning that
I went to the city, and I was so hurried that it put it
entirely out of my mind."</p>

<p>"And I have thought so strange that she did not
write to me. I wish I could hear from her; for I believe
she is in trouble."</p>

<p>"Why do you think that, Addie?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know why, but I can not get rid of the
feeling; and why does she not write to me?"</p>

<p>"You know that she was nearly insane after John's
death; and she may not be in a condition to write."</p>

<p>"True; but I wish, oh! I wish that I could see her."</p>

<p>Winchester regarded his wife a moment in silence,
and then said, "You are growing thin and pale, Addie.
I think a journey would do you good: what say you to
a trip West?"</p>

<p>"I should like it very much, if you could go with me;
but where should we go?"</p>

<p>"I have an aunt, a sister of my mother's, living near
Clinton &mdash;&mdash;; and we might go there. I want to see the
country, and don't know but I can leave my business
now as well as any time. How soon can we be ready?"</p>

<p>"As soon as you please, Edward."</p>

<p>"Well, then, say the first of the week. To-day is
Thursday: I can be ready to start by Monday." And
so it was settled that Addie Winchester and her husband
should go West.</p>

<p>The next day, when Winchester came to dinner, he
brought Addie a letter with a Western post-mark.
"Here is something for you," said he, as he threw it
into her lap; "and it looks like Alice's handwriting."</p>

<!-- page 192 -->

<p>"It is hers," was the reply, as she broke it open, and
glanced at the signature. "O Edward!" she exclaimed,
when she had read it, "William Holten is dead. He
confessed that John was innocent, and that he poisoned
him. He was trying to carry Alice off when he received
his death-wound; and what else do you think?"
she asked, with a merry twinkle of the eye.</p>

<p>"I am sure I can not tell: she is not married again?"</p>

<p>"Fie, now! you know better than that, Mr. Winchester.
No: she has been attending circles, and believes in
spirits."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that; for she is an earnest soul, and
what she believes she will advocate fearlessly. Alice
Shepherd is no common woman."</p>

<p>"So I am glad; but I hardly thought you would
speak out so boldly, Edward."</p>

<p>"I have concluded, wife, that it does not pay to be a
coward; but where is she?"</p>

<p>"At &mdash;&mdash;, some forty miles from &mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"That is not more than a day's drive from Clinton.
We can go to Uncle Denning's first: then I will take you
there, and you can visit with Alice while I look at the
country."</p>

<p>"Don't you want to see Alice too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Addie, and will, but can not spend as much
time with her as you will wish to. Does she speak of
any particular trouble?"</p>

<p>"No: she seems very happy, but says that Pete&mdash;you
remember Pete; the boy that lived at Stiverton's?"</p>

<p>"Yes: he died when Alice wasn't more than fifteen."</p>

<p>"Well, he and Alice were great friends. She says

<!-- page 193 -->

she has seen him, and that he tells her that there is
trouble ahead, but that she is not going to worry about
it, as there will be time enough to meet it when it
comes."</p>

<p>"A wise conclusion, wife, and one that you would
do well to heed."</p>

<p>"But my best of husbands has no occasion for the
use of such a maxim, I suppose?" said Mrs. W., with
a quizzical glance at her monitor.</p>

<p>"Too much, altogether too much, need for it, Addie,"
was his frank reply; and then the conversation turned
upon other subjects.</p>

<p>Monday came, furnishing two passengers for the stage
that ran daily to the nearest railroad stations and, the
day following, Addie and Edward Winchester were
whirling along at railway speed toward their place of
destination, one of the broad prairies of the, to them,
Far West. Day and night the iron horse sped on his tireless
way. Thursday noon brings them to the terminus
of their journey, so far as the cars are concerned; and
the stage is again in requisition. Clinton is reached an
hour after dark, and here they remain till morning.</p>

<p>"Finishing our journey on Friday,&mdash;rather an unlucky
omen, is it not?" asked Mr. Winchester.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Edward: I hope you do not believe in
such whims?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly, Addie: still, early education will have
its influence, and my mother would never commence a
thing on Friday."</p>

<p>"Well, we didn't start on Friday; and, if there is bad
luck to any one, it will be to those where we are going.
I prophesy that we shall have a grand time. By the way,

<!-- page 194 -->

I dreamed of Alice all night; and she looked so pleased,
and, at the same time, seemed pleading for help.
Strange, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, wife! who believes in omens now? I am
sure I do not think it strange that you should dream of
Alice, considering the circumstances: rather strange if
you did not," replied Winchester.</p>

<p>"Did you dream of her?" asked Addie.</p>

<p>"I did not: but you women are so susceptible; and
then it would hardly do for me to be dreaming of other
women, with you by my side. I might talk in my sleep,
you know, and then you would be jealous."</p>

<p>Addie's reply to this sally was a hearty laugh; for the
idea that she could have such a feeling toward Alice
was simply amusing. The conveyance that was to carry
them to Dr. Denning's residence was now at the door;
and, taking their seats therein, they were soon speeding
their way toward the grove that was their point of destination.
Twelve o'clock brought them to the doctor's
grounds. A servant opened the gate that gave them
entrance; and, sweeping down the graveled carriage-way,
they were soon in front of the almost palatial residence.
Making themselves known, they were cordially welcomed;
but almost the first question that the doctor asked
was,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you sick, Mrs. Winchester? You are looking
very pale."</p>

<p>"Why, Addie, what ails you? you are as white as a
ghost!" exclaimed Mr. Winchester.</p>

<p>"Nothing serious," said she, trying to smile. "Doctor,
have you friends stopping with you?"</p>

<p>"I have a few patients: there are none others here,
except my own family. But why do you ask?"</p>

<!-- page 195 -->

<p>"I thought I saw a familiar face at an upper window,
as we drove up; but I must have been mistaken," was
the reply.</p>

<p>Winchester was looking directly at the doctor when
Addie said this, and noticed his startled look, succeeded
immediately by a bland smile, as he replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Resemblances often surprise us into the momentary
belief, madam, that we have previously met individuals
whom we have really never seen before. I have often
wondered at the goodness of God in not permitting
more of such resemblances; for they would be the source
of a great amount of annoyance, to say the least."</p>

<p>Winchester turned again to his wife, and saw, from
her look, that there was something more on her mind
than her words indicated. She opened her lips as if to
speak, closed them again, cast an appealing glance at
her husband, rose partly to her feet, and then sunk back
into her seat.</p>

<p>"Addie, you are certainly sick!"</p>

<p>"I believe I will lie down a little," was her reply.</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly," said the doctor: "wife, show
Mrs. Winchester her room; is there nothing I can do
for you first? Will you not have something to take?"</p>

<p>"Not any thing, thank you: I only need a little rest."</p>

<p>Mrs. Denning conducted Addie to a room off the
parlor. "Now lie and rest as long as you please, my
dear: there will be nothing to disturb you," said she
kindly, as she was about closing the door.</p>

<p>"Will you please send my husband to me? I wish to
see him a moment," said Addie.</p>

<p>"Certainly," was the response.</p>

<p>"O Edward!" exclaimed Addie, as soon as they

<!-- page 196 -->

were alone, "Alice is in this house, for I have seen her.
Just the same glad, pleading look that I saw in my sleep.
What does it mean?"</p>

<p>"You must be mistaken, Addie: it can not be possible;"
and then, as he recollected the doctor's startled
look, he said to himself, "There is something strange
here."</p>

<p>"I am not mistaken, Edward," said she earnestly:
"if I ever saw Alice, I saw her to-day; and it was so
exact a counterpart of my dream, that I nearly fainted."</p>

<p>The doctor's first expression, when his wife returned,
was, "Wife, I shall have to dismiss Miss Wells, as valuable
as her services are to me; for she will never learn
to obey orders."</p>

<p>Mrs. Denning looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>"She has been permitting some of the patients to look
from the front windows again," he continued; "and I
am certain that Mrs. Winchester recognized whoever it
was."</p>

<p>"I believe, doctor," said Mrs. Denning, "that Miss
Wells is in sympathy with the patients, and particularly
with the last one who came. I doubt if she thinks her
insane at all."</p>

<p>"Then the sooner we get rid of her the better," said
the doctor.</p>

<p>"And would that be the wisest course?" asked Mrs.
Denning.</p>

<p>"I do not know what else we can do," he replied.
"I wish I had never gone into this business: it is a
source of constant anxiety, and I don't see as things are
getting any better. For one that we shut up to prevent
contagion, hundreds spring up in every corner of the
land."</p>

<!-- page 197 -->

<p>"That is true," said the lady, "and I wish that we
were well out of it. But self-preservation is the first law
of nature; and, if you permit Miss Wells to leave us
now, the public mind is in such a state of ferment, that
she will be able to turn the indignation of the community
against us. The only safe course that I can see is
to make a patient of her."</p>

<p>"It shall be done, wife," said the doctor; "and see to
it, that she holds no communication with your nephew
and his wife while they are here."</p>

<p>Mr. Winchester was just leaving his wife's room, and
caught the doctor's last words. He listened for more;
but a movement from within warned him that there was
danger of being discovered, so he stole quietly back to
his wife's room.</p>

<p>"I believe you are right, Addie. I recollect now
that Uncle Denning keeps a sort of private asylum:
can it be possible that Alice has gone wholly deranged?"</p>

<p>"I can not believe it, Edward, for her letter was so
hopeful; she seemed cheerful,&mdash;so reconciled to the
past. 'Bitter as my experience has been, I believe
that a loving Father has permitted it all in wisdom:'
these are her very words; and I can not believe, after
all that she has passed through, that her mind has become
unbalanced now."</p>

<p>"Some people really think that a medium is insane:
perhaps that is why she is here."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is," said Addie thoughtfully.</p>

<p>That evening, as they were conversing upon different
subjects, Mr. Winchester turned to his aunt, and said, "I
believe you have the unpleasant task of caring for

<!-- page 198 -->

the insane: what induced you to undertake such a
task?"</p>

<p>The quickly starting tear told how tender the chord
he had touched. "Excuse me, Edward," said she: "it
is a painful subject,&mdash;one upon which I can not speak
to-night."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, aunt; but I have a particular reason
for desiring to know something of your patients. We
have a dear friend, who has been sadly afflicted,&mdash;so
much so, that it was feared at one time that she would
lose her mind; but, the last we heard from her, she was
well, and seemed to be reconciled to, yea, happy in, her
lot. Now, my wife insists that she saw her face at an
upper window to-day, as we drove up."</p>

<p>"What was your friend's name?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Shepherd,&mdash;Alice Shepherd: her name was
Vale before marriage."</p>

<p>There was a momentary struggle in the doctor's mind,
which was noticed by no one but Winchester; and he
could not have done so, had he not been watching, for
its appearance upon the surface was scarcely perceptible.
But, when he spoke, his tones were as calm as a summer
morning. Turning to Addie he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Only a resemblance, Mrs. Winchester; only a resemblance.
I trust that your friend is well and happy."</p>

<p>"Can I see your patients to-morrow, uncle?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I do not often permit them to see strangers; but, as
a special favor to you, I will," was the smiling reply.</p>

<p>Addie arose, and walked to a picture hanging near
the front door. She felt a restlessness, a sense of being
wanted somewhere, that she could not account for; and

<!-- page 199 -->

yet she could not banish it. The doctor was beside her
in a moment, talking to her in tones as smooth as oil,
explaining the different points in the painting, and making
himself obnoxious generally; for the pure, straightforward
nature of Addie Winchester shrank from the
atmosphere of dissimulation which surrounded him.</p>

<p>She bore it for a short time, and then, walking away,
took a seat close by a side door. Dr. Denning cast upon
her a keen glance, and then entered into conversation
with her husband. Addie rested her head against a
window-frame near her, and, as she did so, fancied that
she heard her name called. Rising quickly, she stepped
out into the open air, ere those within had divined her
intention: as she did so, a paper was thrust into her
hand, while a female form flitted around the corner of
the building, and disappeared.</p>

<p>Addie had barely time to put the note into her pocket
ere Mrs. Denning was by her side.</p>

<p>"Are you sick again, my dear?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, only a little restless: I presume I am nervous
from riding so far," was the reply.</p>

<p>"I feared you were, you looked so pale; but I guess
a night's rest will restore you. Perhaps you would like
to retire?"</p>

<p>Now, this was just what Addie wanted; for it would
give her an opportunity to read her note.</p>

<p>"I think I will, aunt," she said: "I presume it will
be the best thing I can do."</p>

<p>Her request was acceded to with alacrity; for it was
fondly thought that she was thus secured, for that time
at least, from contact with those who might tell her that
which they did not wish her to know.</p>

<!-- page 200 -->

<p>On arriving at the room, another difficulty presented
itself; for, instead of leaving Addie alone with the light,
Mrs. Denning kept moving here and there, talking of
this and that, till poor Addie was nearly desperate.</p>

<p>"Were you waiting for the light, aunt?" she at
length asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Denning colored. "No, not exactly: I
thought I would wait and see if there was any thing
you needed."</p>

<p>"Nothing, aunt,&mdash;nothing but quiet; and, as the wife
of a physician, you certainly know how to apologize for
nervous people: if you want the light, I will call when I
am done with it," said Addie, with a smile as bland as
any the doctor could assume.</p>

<p>Thus fairly dismissed, the lady could do no better
than leave the room. "Alone at last," was Addie's
mental comment.</p>

<p>"The impudent jade!" soliloquized Mrs. Denning.
"I presume she thinks that I am not acquainted with
her early history. I wonder where she would have
been now if Edward had not married her."</p>

<p>As soon as Mrs. Denning disappeared, Addie closed
the door, and produced the note from her pocket. With
trembling hand, she unfolded it and read,&mdash;</p>

<p>"DEAR ADDIE,&mdash;Surely the angels must have sent
you here for my deliverance. The trouble I wrote you
of has come; and I am here a close prisoner, charged
with insanity. ALICE SHEPHERD.</p>

<p>"P. S.&mdash;My keeper is my friend, and will give you
this when she can do so without being observed.</p>

<p>"A. S."</p>

<!-- page 201 -->

<p>She had hardly had time to read these few words
when she heard footsteps approaching. Just as she
thrust it into her pocket, the door was opened without
ceremony, and Mrs. Denning said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here, Mrs. Winchester, are some matches. You
can extinguish the light when you are done with it, as
we shall not need it."</p>

<p>Addie was now left alone till her husband came.
She could not sleep; but the restlessness that had so
tortured her was gone, and she quietly awaited his footstep.</p>

<p>"I will manage this," said he, when he had heard
her story: "you keep quiet, and wait the development
of events; but, when we leave this place, Alice goes with
us."</p>

<p>In the morning, Addie arose refreshed: she felt that
the object desired would be accomplished, and had rested
upon that assurance. She was complimented upon her
improved looks, and replied with a smile. When
breakfast was over, they all repaired to the sitting-room,
where, after about half an hour's conversation, Mr.
Winchester said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Uncle, do you include me in the promise made to
my wife last evening?"</p>

<p>"What promise?" asked the doctor, with a look of
annoyance.</p>

<p>"That of seeing your patients, uncle."</p>

<p>"Oh! I hoped you had forgotten that: I hardly think
I ought to have made it. I should very much like to
gratify you; but my first duty is to them, and they always
seem worse after seeing company."</p>

<p>"Then you do not intend keeping your promise?"
said Addie.</p>

<!-- page 202 -->

<p>"If you insist upon it, I must, of course; but I was
hoping that you would release me."</p>

<p>Mr. Winchester glanced at his wife with an expression
that said "Wait;" and then, turning to the doctor,
asked, "What seems to be the greatest inciting cause
to insanity just now, uncle?"</p>

<p>"There are various causes, sir; but the principal one
just at this time seems to be the monomania about spirits.
I don't know where it will end; but I pray God
that it may not be permitted to go much further, for it
is bringing ruin and desolation to many a family."</p>

<p>"Are any of your present patients here from that
cause?"</p>

<p>"I make that my specialty,&mdash;the work to which I
am willing to devote my life; hoping thus, through my
own affliction, to become a blessing to others."</p>

<p>"Your own affliction, uncle?"</p>

<p>"Yes: have you not learned the sad history of your
Cousin Helen?"</p>

<p>"I have heard that she was married,&mdash;nothing since
then."</p>

<p>The doctor sighed, and his wife turned away her
head to hide the fast-gathering tears. "She was our
only one, and the darling of our hearts," said he at
length; "but we have been sorely punished for making
an idol of any earthly object. She married, and married
well. Her husband was not exactly the one we should
have chosen for her,&mdash;not that he was not good enough;
but we could not bear to have our darling subjected to
the trials that necessarily fall to the lot of a minister's
wife. But they loved each other, were devotedly attached,
and all went well while he lived.</p>

<!-- page 203 -->

<p>"At his death, which was eighteen months after their
marriage,&mdash;at his death, the work of retribution commenced;
for she had made an idol of him, and we of
her."</p>

<p>"I think, uncle, that you and I might differ somewhat
in our views upon this subject; but please go on.
If I understand you aright, Cousin Helen became insane."</p>

<p>"She did; and the first symptom that we noticed
came in the form of what thousands of poor deluded
souls call spirit-manifestations."</p>

<p>"How?" asked Addie.</p>

<p>"When she went to her room to pray, she would
come out insisting that she had seen Albert; and the
more we tried to reason with her, to show her the fallacy
of such an idea, the more positive she became in
asserting that it was really true."</p>

<p>"How did this belief seem to affect her?" asked
Mr. Winchester.</p>

<p>"Very pleasantly at first; but, when she found that
she could not convince us of its truth, she began to droop,
and to spend more time by herself, till one day she
came to me with tears in her eyes, saying she believed
that God had forsaken her.</p>

<p>" 'Why do you think that, my child?' I asked.</p>

<p>" 'Because, father, I was not content with making an
idol of my husband when here: I have kept it up even
beyond the tomb; and now, when I go to my closet to
pray, Jesus hides his face, and only Albert is present
I can see nothing else; I can think of nothing else.
Alas! alas! I fear that this idolatry has cost me my
soul.'</p>

<!-- page 204 -->

<p>" 'God is very merciful,' I replied: 'only believe,
and all will yet be well.'</p>

<p>" 'But I can not believe, I can not pray. O father,
pray for me!' she fairly shrieked: and, if ever earnest
prayers ascended from mortal lips, they were those that
went up from her mother and myself for the next hour;
but, alas! we arose from our knees to clasp her in our
arms a raving maniac."</p>

<p>There was silence for a few moments; and then
Mr. Winchester asked, "Did your daughter know any
thing of Spiritualism? had she read any of their works?"</p>

<p>"I did not know as she had at that time; but I learned
afterward, that, while she was in school, some two or
three of the girls used to steal away, and visit one of
those modern witches called mediums, and Helen sometimes
went with them. Here was the first step in the
wrong,&mdash;disobedience to parents and teachers, in prying
into that which was forbidden."</p>

<p>"And for which you both forgive her from the very
depths of your parental hearts."</p>

<p>"Most certainly; but that did not prevent the consequences,"
was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>"And whence came those consequences, uncle?"</p>

<p>"From breaking God's just and holy laws, of course."</p>

<p>"Consequences which we must reap whether the
law is broken ignorantly or willfully?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, in some cases; that is, physically: but
moral law is quite a different thing," was the hesitating
reply.</p>

<p>"If I put two substances into a bottle, both of which
are harmless in themselves, but by chemical action in
their union they become poison, and I drink that poison,

<!-- page 205 -->

will my ignorance of the fact prevent its legitimate
action?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not: I conceded that."</p>

<p>"Never mind, uncle: I wish to ask you one or two
more questions, and then to show you the why. If the
chemical action of those two substances is too great for
the strength of the bottle, will any amount of praying
prevent its breaking?"</p>

<p>"What a strange question!" said Mrs. Denning.</p>

<p>"Not so strange as it may seem, madam. You believe
in obedience to parents, of course; but suppose you ignorantly
command your child to take poison, will the
fact of her obedience prevent the legitimate action of
that poison?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"If there is a remedy at hand, that, if taken in time,
will cure her, but you think it will make her worse,
and forbid her taking it,&mdash;if she feels that she must
have it, and takes it in spite of your prohibition, will the
fact that she has disobeyed you prevent the action of
that remedy in saving her life?"</p>

<p>"Of course it would not; but what are you aiming
at, Mr. Winchester?"</p>

<p>"I wish to show you, uncle, that your affliction is
the result of the violation of physical, and not of moral
law."</p>

<p>"That is not possible, sir,&mdash;not possible. There was
no physical law violated, only moral and mental: she
was perfectly healthy in body, even to the day of her
death."</p>

<p>"How did she die, then?"</p>

<p>"By violence: she managed to secrete a knife, and

<!-- page 206 -->

destroyed herself with it. True, she did not die immediately;
but that was the cause of it. The loss of
blood, however, seemed to cool the fever of her brain;
and she was very calm during the last hour of her life,
and was perfectly reconciled to go,&mdash;said that she
had sinned, but that God had forgiven her, and all was
well. Were it not for this, I am certain that I should
go mad with despair. But I regard Spiritualism as the
cause of her ruin; and, while I live, it shall be my sole
effort to put it down."</p>

<p>"I told you, uncle, that I should not agree with you;
for I do not regard Spiritualism as in the least to blame
for your daughter's death."</p>

<p>"To what, then, do you attribute it?"</p>

<p>"To the result of her early teachings, combined with
the ignorance of those who had the care of her."</p>

<p>The doctor flushed. "No disrespect, uncle: the best
and wisest of people can not be otherwise than ignorant
of that they refuse to investigate, or, if they make the
attempt, do so from their own past standards, instead of
applying the rules that belong to the new development.
Now, this is just what our church people have done in
reference to Spiritualism. They have utterly refused
to investigate, or have done so from wrong stand-points;
consequently, are ignorant of its true significance,"</p>

<p>"Does not the Bible tell us to let these things alone?"</p>

<p>"The Bible tells us to 'prove <i>all</i> things, and hold
fast that which is good.' "</p>

<p>"And I have proved it, and found it an upas-tree of
bitterness, sir."</p>

<p>"And that is just where I wish to show you that you
are mistaken, doctor. You have shown me by your

<!-- page 207 -->

own confession, that you believe God punishes sin, outside
of the act itself: still, in your answers to questions
that I have asked you, have proved an entirely different
doctrine. For instance: you speak of disobedience to
parents and teachers, as the first step toward your
daughter's ruin, and yet have conceded conditions in
which disobedience might prove a blessing, and its opposite
a curse."</p>

<p>"And would you counsel disobedience to parents,
then?" exclaimed Mrs. Denning.</p>

<p>"No; but I would show you that it is the relation
which the act sustains to God's laws, and not the fact of
a parent's command, that decides the result. God's
laws are infallible, and can not be set aside; man's judgment
fallible, liable to be in the wrong."</p>

<p>"And what has this to do with Helen's case?" asked
the doctor.</p>

<p>"Simply this, uncle: just as long as you believe an
affliction, that has no direct connection with a particular
act, to have come in consequence of that act, you will
never seek for the true cause."</p>

<p>"And what do you believe the true cause to have
been in her case?"</p>

<p>"The violation of physical law, caused by false religious
teaching."</p>

<p>"And do you, Mr. Winchester, ignore the religion of
the Bible?"</p>

<p>"I know what you would say, uncle. I do ignore
much that is called the religion of the Bible; for instance,
the idea that God punishes us for loving our
friends too well by taking them from us. I believe this
idea to be dishonoring to God, and ruinous in its tendency;

<!-- page 208 -->

and the belief that God punishes us outside
of the legitimate consequences of violated law is, to my
mind, equally so. Now, by your own confession, you
believe both of the above, and taught them to your
daughter."</p>

<p>"Does not the Bible say that God is a jealous God?"</p>

<p>"Suppose the Bible told me that God was a devil,
would I be under obligation to receive it? Certainly not,
you will say; and yet you regard jealousy, as exhibited
by men and women, as one of the most despicable traits
of character,&mdash;sufficient proof that God, the Infinite
Spirit of love and truth, could never stoop to being jealous
of the love of his creatures."</p>

<p>"You are talking very strangely, sir."</p>

<p>"I presume it appears so to you; but hear me through.
Your child learns something of the philosophy and facts
of Spiritualism,&mdash;enough to induce the belief that the
return of the loved one is possible. She loves her husband
intensely; and, in thus loving him whom she had
seen, she loved God, whom she had not seen. He dies;
and her heart goes out after him with an intensity of
yearning that is like taking the kingdom of heaven by
violence. Love responds to love; she feels his presence;
his spirit-magnetism, acting in conjunction with her intense
desire, stimulates the natural but hitherto dormant
faculty of clairvoyance, and she sees him.</p>

<p>"Now, what is the result? Does she love God less?
No: but more, much more; and she is happy, and would
have continued so, had she been let alone. But she has
confidence in you, her parents: your disbelief in the reality
of that which gives her so much comfort makes
her doubt. Her love to God, and love to man in the

<!-- page 209 -->

person of her husband, are so blended that she can not
separate them; and thus these two loves, so naturally
harmonious, become the source of a terrible conflict in
her mind, through the false idea that one is sinful, and
opposed to the other. In this conflict, the brain, like
the bottle in the illustration I gave, unable to stand the
pressure, gives way, and she is a maniac."</p>

<p>The doctor groaned aloud, and Mrs. Denning seemed
about to faint. "This may seem cruel," said Mr. Winchester:
"but I am not intentionally so; and I believe,
that, when you have learned the true lesson contained in
this bitter affliction, you will take an entirely different
course from that which you are now taking."</p>

<p>There was silence for a few moments: then Mr. Winchester
continued, "Now, uncle, I do not know just
what your motive is for concealing the fact; but you
have one patient here that we must see before we leave.
I mean Mrs. Shepherd. She has been here but a short
time, and, so far, has received no particular injury; but,
if not permitted to leave, may become as insane as was
your daughter."</p>

<p>Had a shell exploded in their midst, the doctor and
his wife could not have been more astonished, more
completely taken by surprise. "What do you propose
doing with her?" was at length asked.</p>

<p>"Take her home with us," was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>"She was left in my care; and, if I let her go, her
uncle will hold me responsible."</p>

<p>"Let him make trouble about it if he dare," was the
response: "Alice Shepherd is no more insane than he
is; and he knows it."</p>

<p>The doctor still hesitated. "Did he bring certificates

<!-- page 210 -->

from competent physicians to show that she was
insane?" continued Winchester.</p>

<p>"I will bring her down," was the reply; for this last
question awakened him to the fact that the proceedings
had been illegal throughout.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, Alice and Addie were clasped in
each other's arms; and, on the following day, she went
forth with her friends from what, to her, had so nearly
proved a living tomb. The impression made by Edward
Winchester upon the doctor and his wife did not
pass away with the occasion. They commenced an
earnest investigation of that which they had so unqualifiedly
condemned; and the result was, that they were
soon numbered among its stringent advocates, and their
house became the home of, instead of a prison for,
mediums.</p>

<p class="small">"That which I most feared came upon me."&mdash;<i>Bible</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>NEVER was this text more fully exemplified
than in the case of the Vales. Their
principal object in sending Alice to Dr.
Denning's establishment was to prevent
the disgrace of having a relative of theirs
go forth publicly to advocate an unpopular cause; and
mark the result.</p>

<p>When Porter returned to N&mdash;&mdash;, he, of course, called
to see Alice, and was very much surprised to learn from
her uncle that she was no longer with them. The doctor
had written to Mr. Vale, stating the circumstances
under which she had left there; and he had hardly recovered
from the chagrin consequent upon her escape,
when his equilibrium was again disturbed by this call
of Porter's.</p>

<p>He could have wished the intruder anywhere else
but there, but still was forced to treat him civilly.</p>

<p>"Gone back East!" said Porter wonderingly. "Was
it not rather unexpected?"</p>

<p>"Rather," was Vale's hesitating reply. "She went
with us to visit some friends,&mdash;old acquaintances of
Father Shelton's, residing in Williams County,&mdash;and
found, when she reached there, that the lady was a relative

<!-- page 212 -->

of some of her old friends in Ellsville; and, while
there, these friends came out on a visit: so she concluded
to return with them."</p>

<p>"Have you heard from her since she left there?"
asked Porter.</p>

<p>"Not directly: she will probably not write till she
reaches her old home; and, as they expect to stop at
different points, they will be some time on the way."</p>

<p>"Do you recollect the name of the people she went
with?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do, Mr. Porter," said Vale, with some
asperity in his tones. "You are questioning me as
closely, sir, as if you doubted the truthfulness of my
statement. The name was Winchester, and the gentleman
is a nephew of Mrs. Denning's." Mr. Vale could
have bitten his own tongue with vexation when he saw
the expression upon Porter's face at the mention of this
last name.</p>

<p>"And there is where you went, was it?"</p>

<p>"It was," he replied, with as much self-possession as
he could assume. "Are you acquainted with them?"</p>

<p>"Keeps a private insane asylum, I believe," continued
Porter.</p>

<p>"He has sometimes taken such patients, at the particular
request of friends."</p>

<p>"And may I inquire, Mr. Vale, if you met those
friends of Mrs. Shepherd's, or did they come after you
left?" asked Porter coolly.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Vale, rising to his feet, while his face
flushed with anger, "your questions are becoming impertinent:
what is it that you would insinuate?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, if there is nothing hidden," replied Porter,
bowing himself out.</p>

<!-- page 213 -->

<p>Now, Mr. Vale was not what would be called a bad
man; but he had something of the same stubborn nature
as his brother, Alice's father,&mdash;was unyielding, even
when proved in the wrong. He merely regretted taking
the course that he had done in reference to Alice
and her mediumship; but, the wrong step taken, it required
still another to keep it out of sight: and, as to
being defeated, he had no idea of permitting it; that is,
the disgrace that he had sought to avoid.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vale was busy when Mr. Porter called, and did
not see him, but wondered at her husband's troubled
countenance when she came into the room soon after
his visitor had left. "What is the matter, James?" she
asked: "are you sick? or is something troubling you?"</p>

<p>"My head is not feeling quite right this morning,"
said he, trying to smile. "I think I will go out into
the air a while;" and, taking his hat, he, without any
definite object in view, started toward the post-office.
"What shall I do?" said he to himself, as he walked
along. "It will never do to let this thing get out, and
yet Porter will be sure to find out every thing. Alice
will write and tell him, if he learns it in no other way."</p>

<p>Right here he came to a full stop, just as if some new
thought had occurred to him, and he could not decide
to act upon it without a moment's quiet. "I think I
will try it," said he, after a moment's reflection. "Denning's
daughter married a brother of the postmaster
here; and, if there is any thing on earth that he hates, it
is a Spiritualist;" and, walking briskly forward, he soon
found himself in Uncle Sam's distributing office.</p>

<p>"Is there a letter here for J. N. Porter?" said he in
so low a tone as not to be overheard by those standing
around.</p>

<!-- page 214 -->

<p>The postmaster looked up as if a little surprised, but,
seeing who it was, supposed it was all right, and quietly
put one into his hands. Mr. Vale glanced at it, and
knew, from the writing and post-mark, that it was from
Alice. "Are you very busy, Mr. Rawson?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Somewhat, though not so much so but that I can
bear an interruption, if there is any thing of importance
on hand," was the reply.</p>

<p>"I wish very much to have a few moments' conversation
with you," said Vale.</p>

<p>"Very well, walk this way then."</p>

<p>"I want, in the first place, Mr. Rawson, that you
should look at this letter: examine the post-mark, and
especially the hand-writing, so closely that you will
know it if another comes here from the same person;
and, when you have done so, I will tell you why."</p>

<p>"No harm, I hope, to you or yours, Mr. Vale," was
that worthy's reply, as he took the letter, and commenced
the required examination.</p>

<p>"Yes: there is a great deal of harm threatened.
This Porter is a Spiritualist; and I have reason to think
that he is courting my niece. She went nearly crazy
when she lost her husband: indeed, we feared that she
would be quite so; and, just as she began to be a little
more cheerful, she made this fellow's acquaintance. He
induced her to go to circles, and has so far psychologized
her that she really believes herself a medium for spirit
communication. She has gone East again, through the
influence of some old friends: and what I want now is
to break up all correspondence between them; for, if this
thing goes on, she will be as insane yet as your brother's
wife was."</p>

<!-- page 215 -->

<p>Mr. Rawson stood a moment as if irresolute. "What
is it that you wish me to do, Mr. Vale?" he at length
asked.</p>

<p>"That which I would not wish you to do under
almost any other circumstance," was the reply; "but
Alice is very dear to me, and I must save her if I can.
I wish you to retain her letters, all of them, and give
them to me; for, if she can not accomplish her object by
writing directly to Porter, she will write to that medium,
Ellen Bell."</p>

<p>"What, that young siren! indeed, I will do any
thing in the bounds of reason to defeat the like of her.
It is dangerous business, Mr. Vale, this tampering with
letters; but, in fighting the Devil, I don't know as we
should be choice of our weapons. If nothing else could
influence me to act for you in this matter, the memory
of my lost brother, and the fate of his unhappy wife,
would decide the question."</p>

<p>"Thanks,&mdash;a thousand thanks; but had you not
better keep the envelope to this?" asked Vale, as he
tore it from the letter inclosed.</p>

<p>"I think it a good idea; for one can compare better
than they can judge from memory," was the response.</p>

<p>Things being thus arranged to his satisfaction, Mr.
Vale left the office; for he was anxious to read Alice's
letter, but not there.</p>

<p>Porter, after his interview with Mr. Vale, went directly
to Miss Bell's. She had company at the time of
his arrival, and could not see him just then; and he
waited at least half an hour before he was summoned to
her presence.</p>

<!-- page 216 -->

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Porter? Glad to see you;
but our friend has gone," was the greeting he received.</p>

<p>"So I perceive; but can you tell me where?" He
said this, first for the purpose of testing her powers in
this direction, and, further, because he had his doubts in
reference to what was told him of her going East.</p>

<p>"I can," said she, "and that without using my
mediumship."</p>

<p>He looked up inquiringly, and she continued: "Henry
Pond, one of the members of our circle, was down at
Mr. Shelton's place last week on business, and one of
their preachers was there. Pond says that he don't
know what made him do as he did; but, when he went
into the room, almost the first question asked him, after
they learned that he was from this place, was, if he knew
any thing of the medium here; and without a moment's
thought, or even an idea of what he was going to say,
he responded that he never inquired after such trash.</p>

<p>"He says that they looked very much pleased, and
asked if he was a member of any church. Now, Pond
belonged to the Methodists before he came here, and has
never had his name taken from their books; so he told
them that he was a Methodist, or had been, but, as he
was not settled as yet, had not joined anywhere since
he came West.</p>

<p>" 'Dangerous, dangerous, young man, to live without
the watch-care of the church,' said the preacher.
'You ought to take a letter, and hand it into the class,
if you don't stop in a place more than six weeks, or at
least to report yourself, and claim that brotherly watch-care
to which you are entitled. I fear that you have
not done even this, my young friend; for N&mdash;&mdash; is on

<!-- page 217 -->

my circuit, and I do not recollect seeing your face in
our meetings there.'</p>

<p>" 'Perhaps I have been a little careless, but will try
to do better in future,' was Pond's response."</p>

<p>"The croaking hypocrites!" exclaimed Porter: "they
wouldn't get me to make any such concessions."</p>

<p>"Wait, and hear the sequel," said Miss Bell. "Mr.
Pond did not intend it as a concession: he can do
better, much better, in the future, and so can we all.
Progress is what we are aiming for; but it does not
follow that we shall do what they think is better, or
progress after their fashion."</p>

<p>"Strange kind of progress it would be, I am thinking;
but what next?"</p>

<p>Miss Bell looked at him fixedly for a moment, while
her eyes assumed a far-off expression. "Joseph," said
she at length, "will you never learn to separate that
tinge of bitterness from your otherwise noble nature?"</p>

<p>The young man made no reply to this appeal, but,
dropping his head into his hands, sat silent for some
minutes; and a close observer would have seen the tears
trickling through his fingers, while the medium, resuming
her natural expression, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! you wished to know what next. I believe I
must have lost myself for a moment. Pond said that
they then commenced talking of the evil tendency of
Spiritualism,&mdash;said that it was setting people crazy all
over the country; and, in confirmation of that statement,
Mr. Shelton spoke of Alice,&mdash;said she was losing her
reason, and that he had advised her removal to a private
asylum.</p>

<p>" 'And did her friends follow your advice?' asked

<!-- page 218 -->

Pond. Mr. Shelton looked as if he thought he had
said too much perhaps, and replied rather hesitatingly,
'I think not: they talked of doing so; but I hear that
she has gone back to her friends in New York;' and
then the conversation turned upon my humble self."</p>

<p>"Ah! and what did they have to say about you?"</p>

<p>"They seemed very much troubled as to how they
could put an end to my influence; asked Mr. Pond
various questions, and among other things what he
thought had better be done."</p>

<p>"And what did he tell them?" asked Porter.</p>

<p>"That 'most any means was justifiable in abating a
nuisance; and then the preacher proposed to burn me
out."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! and what did Mr. Shelton say to that?"</p>

<p>"That it would not do; for, if found out, it would do
their cause more harm than I could if left undisturbed."</p>

<p>"The old fellow has a little sense left, I really must
acknowledge; but did you learn nothing further of
Alice?"</p>

<p>"Nothing further, Mr. Porter; but there are some
here who think she is in a private asylum in Williams
County, and they are going to take steps to ascertain;
would have done so immediately, but my controlling
spirit told them to wait."</p>

<p>"I think it is just as well that you did; for I hardly
believe she is there now, though she may have been
taken there in the first place," said Porter in reply,
and then related what occurred at his interview with
Mr. Vale.</p>

<p>"Have you been to the post-office?" asked Miss
Bell.</p>

<!-- page 219 -->

<p>"I have not: I was not expecting letters here; but
why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"If Alice is free, Mr. Porter,&mdash;if she is where she
can control her own acts,&mdash;she will write to you or
me.</p>

<p>"I never thought of that: I will go this minute,"
said Porter, starting to his feet.</p>

<p>"And inquire for me, if you please, though it may
be no use, even if there is one there; for I have sometimes
thought that I did not get all my letters."</p>

<p>"He would not dare retain them, Miss Bell," said
Porter, with flashing eye.</p>

<p>"Don't get excited now," said she quietly: "it is a
long road that has no turn to it. But please hurry;
for they will not keep your letters, if they do mine; and
I am anxious to know if there is any thing from Mrs.
Shepherd."</p>

<p>Thus importuned, Porter was not long in making his
way to the office, but with what result our readers
already know.</p>

<p>On leaving the office, Porter passed down a different
street from the one he came, and, without intending it,
found himself going in the direction of Vale's. He
had gone about three squares, when a letter, lying partly
under the edge of a plank, caught his attention.</p>

<p>"Some one has lost a letter," said he to himself; but,
not thinking that it could be of any interest to him, he
had passed clear by, when a feeling that he could not
account for prompted him to turn, and pick it up. The
envelope was undirected; but, being open, he proceeded
to look within: and judge of his astonishment to find
that it was addressed to himself, and from Alice.</p>

<!-- page 220 -->

<p>"More villainy!" was his involuntary thought; and,
looking up the street, saw Vale coming around the next
corner, glancing here and there with a quick, nervous
movement, as though searching for something that it
was important he should find. Porter held the letter
quietly in his hand till Vale was close upon him, and
then asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you lost any thing, Mr. Vale?"</p>

<p>That gentleman glared upon him as though he would
say, "What is that to you?" but, on seeing the letter
in Porter's hand, turned white to the very lips. Porter
held up the letter with the utmost coolness, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I just picked up this, which I find is addressed to
me. I did not know but it might be what you were
looking for."</p>

<p>Vale saw, that, so far as moral certainty was concerned,
Porter knew that he had taken his letter; but there was
no legal proof: so, putting on a show of indignation, he
exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What in God's name do you suppose I want with
your letters?"</p>

<p>"Take care there, now: don't be calling upon strangers,"
said Porter, in his most provoking tones. Vale had
too much self-respect, or, I should rather say, too much
regard for his reputation, to fight; but his rage was so
great, that the only way in which he could restrain himself
was to turn and walk abruptly away.</p>

<p>"The wicked flee when no man pursueth," called
Porter after him; but just then the words, "Will you
never learn to separate that tinge of bitterness from
your otherwise noble nature?" flashed through his
mind; and, with all disposition to taunt or trifle gone,

<!-- page 221 -->

he walked on in sober silence. And now a word as to
Vale's losing the letter.</p>

<p>He had left the office, as we have already seen, that
he might be able to learn the contents of the letter without
danger of interruption, fearing that, if he waited to
read it there, a friend of Porter's, who was present,
might, by some chance, catch a glimpse of some word
it contained: so he hurried out, first slipping it into
another envelope. He resolved not to look at it till
safely seated in his own room and the door locked; but
alas for human calculations, and especially when guilt
takes part therein!</p>

<p>He had not gone more than half the distance to his
home, when he met a friend, who said, "Glad to meet
you, Vale: have you that note with you? I wish to pay
it now."</p>

<p>"I believe I have," was the response; but in his absent
state of mind, together with the tremulousness that
conscious wrong gives to those who are not hardened,
he thrust his hand into every pocket but the right one;
and, in his search, the letter upon which so much depended,
fell to the ground without either of them perceiving
it. Judge, then, of his feelings, when, upon
reaching his room, he found that it was gone.</p>

<p>He looked so perplexed when he met his wife at dinner,
that she insisted upon knowing what troubled him.
"If I never believed the Bible before, I should do so
now," was his impatient response.</p>

<p>"Why, what new proof have you had of its truthfulness?"</p>

<p>"There is a declaration therein which reads something
like this: 'That which is done in secret, shall

<!-- page 222 -->

be proclaimed upon the house-top;' and it is becoming
literally true as it regards our course toward Alice.
Every step that we have taken to keep her from making
a fool of herself, and disgracing us, is being made
public as fast as possible."</p>

<p>"How can that be?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Because the heart of modern infidelity is full of
eyes round about,&mdash;yes, and ears too; and the birds
of the air whisper the secret thoughts of the heart."</p>

<p>"Can't you speak intelligibly? How bitter you are!"</p>

<p>"I feel bitter," was his response; and then, after a
moment's silence, he told her of his interview with Porter
in the morning, the course he had taken to prevent
a communication between him and Alice, finishing
up with the lost letter and the fact of its falling into
Porter's hands. "That he, of all others, should find it,
is what provokes me," said he.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vale paled with fear. "O husband! how
could you take such a step? You have not only done
wrong, but have made yourself liable to imprisonment."</p>

<p>"As to the wrong, I can not see it; for, if Alice needed
treatment lest she should become insane, she is certainly
unfit to be trusted with a correspondence that
will injure her best friends in the eyes of those who do
not know the true state of the case: and, as to the other,
he has no proof as to who took the letter from the office.
Still, the impression will be made upon the minds of the
people that I did it; and the disgrace will be as great,
even greater, than if we had left Alice to pursue her
own course: for, in that case, it would have been indirect;
in this, it is direct."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that there is no wrong in

<!-- page 223 -->

breaking open a letter addressed to another?" asked
Mrs. Vale in astonishment.</p>

<p>"No: I did not say that. What I mean is this. If
the first step was justifiable, the last was. If we had
a right to confine Alice, we have a right to open her
letters. I am satisfied that the whole thing was wrong
from beginning to end; for, if the principle was carried
out, there would be an end to personal safety. She has
just as good a right to confine us if we are taking a
course that does not please her, as we have to confine
her."</p>

<p>"You do not pretend to say, Mr. Vale, that Christians
have no right to prevent their friends from taking a
course that will end in the ruin of both body and soul?"</p>

<p>"If people are determined to go to hell, God does
not interfere to prevent it; and why should we? No,
wife: Christians have no such rights. God never gave
them such rights; for such is the weakness of man's
judgment, that all safety of person would be at an end,
even if the very best of them were permitted to assume
such a prerogative."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that God's children&mdash;those who
are striving to obey his laws&mdash;ought to have some
rights over those who are constantly trampling these
laws under foot."</p>

<p>"It may seem so to you; but, were it so, our free institutions
would soon be no more. I tell you, wife, that
the liberties of our country would be safer in the hands
of any other class of people than that of the clergy."</p>

<p>"O James! how can you say that, when the very
spirit of Christianity is that of liberty?"</p>

<p>"The liberty to do what they claim to be right."</p>

<!-- page 224 -->

<p>"Not what they claim, but what God in his holy book
has declared to be right."</p>

<p>"A book which one class of men declare means one
thing, and another class that it teaches right the opposite.
Why, even Spiritualists claim that the Bible
would be but a shell if Spiritualism was taken out of it."</p>

<p>"Their claiming this does not make it so."</p>

<p>"True, wife; but, when claims conflict, who is to
decide? It will never do for one class to have or hold
pre-eminence over another: each must decide for himself,
and each be fully persuaded in his own mind."</p>

<p>Mrs. Vale sighed, looked at her little one, and said,
"You may be right, James; but it seems hard that
we can not be allowed to suppress that which may yet
involve our own children in ruin. Could I have my
choice between seeing my child a corpse and having
her grow up a Spiritualist, I should say, Let her die."</p>

<p>"And the Jew would say the same thing in reference
to his child's becoming a Christian."</p>

<p>"There is no use in talking with you, James," said
she, with a touch of indignation in her tone; "for such
comparisons are simply ridiculous. We know that we
are right,&mdash;know that the Christian religion is the only
hope of the race. Such being the case, there is some
difference between enforcing its claims and that of
others."</p>

<p>"So thought the founders of the inquisition, or, to
come nearer home, those who hung the Quakers."</p>

<p>"James! James! are you turning infidel?"</p>

<p>"I am questioning; and, the more I question, the more
I am mystified."</p>

<p>"God help you, my husband!" said she earnestly;

<!-- page 225 -->

to which he responded with a fervent "Amen!" and
then there was silence between them.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Porter had gone to Miss Bell's with
the letter that had been so nearly lost to him. Finding
several friends there, he gave them the history of the
way in which it came into his hands, and then read to
them Alice's account of the manner in which she had
been deceived into visiting Dr. Denning's establishment,
of her feelings when she found that they had left her
there a close prisoner, the difficulty which she had in
communicating with her friends after accidentally getting
a glimpse of them from a forbidden window, to which
she had access through the kindness of her keeper, and
her joy at the recovery of her freedom.</p>

<p>This was read, re-read, and commented upon; and
twenty-four hours had not elapsed ere it was known
all through the place that Mrs. Shepherd's uncle had
taken her to an insane asylum because she was a Spiritualist,
that she had been taken from there by friends
from the East, and that he had tried to prevent her communicating
with her friends by taking her letters from
the office.</p>

<p>It was in vain that his friends urged that there was
no evidence of the latter: the idea became fixed in the
minds of the people, and could not be eradicated without
proof to the contrary. The result of all this was, that
those who sought to avoid disgrace by doing violence to
the rights of another found themselves enveloped in
such an atmosphere of distrust, that they actually sold
their property at a sacrifice, in order to escape its withering
effect.</p>

<p>ALICE found a warm welcome in the little
village from which she had been absent
less than two years; and yet the events
that had been crowded therein made it
seem an age to her. "I have lived a lifetime
since I left you," she said; "and if&mdash;</p>

<p>my future life ought to be worth something to myself

<p>Edward Winchester and his wife were interested in
the new phenomena, and circles met weekly at their
house for the purpose of investigation. It was found
that Alice was to be both a test-medium and a speaker.
She did not hesitate to walk in the path indicated, and
was soon quite a favorite with the public in the latter
capacity.</p>

<p>But this did not seem to be her permanent field of

labor; for the pleadings of her woman's heart, in connection
with the earnestly-pressed suit of another, induced
her, some eighteen months after, to take upon herself,
for the second time, the vows of marriage. She lost
none of her personal freedom as Mrs. Porter, consequently
went before the public occasionally, that is,
when she chose to do so; but feeling, as every true
woman does, that the domestic altar is the most sacred
of all fanes, she did not choose to be absent long enough
to let its fires grow dim. But, as a test-medium, her
home became the resort of many.</p>

<p>It was not to be expected, however, that she could
pursue an unpopular course, and escape unscathed.
There are foes for every one to face; and every soul
must stem the flood of opposition if it would attain to
real excellence. The cross and the crown of thorns
belong not alone to Jesus. There is a principle in nature
which makes it necessary that each should bear the
cross, and wear the crown of thorns, ere he can wear
the crown of glory.</p>

<p>Alice felt this; and when scandal made itself busy with
her name, or foes watched for her feet to slide, she held
firmly on her way, realizing that "one self-approving
hour" outweighs whole years of condemnation from
those who do not understand us or our work. It is a
serious thing to trifle with the good name of another:
still, there were some incidents that occurred in this connection,
in her experience, which were so laughable they
will bear repeating.</p>

<p>Alice had an engagement to fill some forty miles from
home; and Mr. Porter had business that led him partly
in the same direction, and would occupy about the same

<!-- page 228 -->

length of time: so they went together as far as they
could, and then agreed to meet at the same place on
their return. Alice reached the point designated some
two hours in advance, bringing with her a lady lecturer,
who had accepted an invitation to spend a few weeks at
her home.</p>

<p>"Well, Alice," said Porter, as soon as they were
comfortably seated, after the introductions were over,
"I have some news for you."</p>

<p>"News is no new thing: what is it?" she replied
quietly.</p>

<p>"Only listen to her now, Miss Holstein," said Porter;
"so quietly indifferent, and still as anxious to hear
as can be. I have a notion not to tell her any thing
about it."</p>

<p>"Oh, do, please!" said Alice, putting on a mock look
of distress.</p>

<p>"Then, since you so desire to know, we have parted:
you have run away with another man."</p>

<p>"Ah! that is news indeed: when did it happen?"</p>

<p>Just a moment before, the landlady had come into
the room, and taken a seat by the window; but her presence
did not interfere with the conversation of our
party.</p>

<p>"That is what I did not learn; but it has surely happened,
for the man who told me said that my brother
told him. I am certainly very much obliged to him for
giving me a brother; only I should like to see him soon,
having never had the happiness of having one before."</p>

<p>"Please stop your nonsense, Joseph, and tell us just
what you mean," said Alice.</p>

<p>"Getting anxious, are you? Well, the night I left

<!-- page 229 -->

you, I stopped with a farmer some two miles from the
little village of S&mdash;&mdash;: Deacon Barnes, they call him. I
gave them my name; but it seems that they did not
quite understand it. After supper, the conversation
turned upon general subjects; and, among the rest, I
mentioned Spiritualism."</p>

<p>"The deacon had been rather quiet before: but this
loosened his tongue, and for at least half an hour I was
regaled with an account of the follies and crimes of
Spiritualists; and, among others, a Mrs. Porter was
named,&mdash;a lecturer, he said, who had recently left her
husband, and gone away with another man.</p>

<p>" 'Indeed!' said I; 'and do you know any thing of
this woman?'</p>

<p>" 'Not personally; but my information is as direct as
this: her husband's brother told our minister.'</p>

<p>" 'Did he give any thing of her previous history?' I
asked; for I wished to ascertain if it was really my wife
that was intended. 'It appears,' he continued, 'that
she has been twice married. She went insane after the
death of her first husband, and was just recovering when
she fell in with some Spiritualists, who persuaded her
that she was a medium, and ought to go into the field as
a speaker. Soon after, she married this Porter; but
it seems that she has found some one else that she likes
better, and is practicing what she preaches by going off
with him.'</p>

<p>" 'I think there must be a mistake somewhere,' said
I. 'The history of two persons of the same name has
evidently been mixed; for it can not be the lecturer
who has thus left her husband.'</p>

<p>" 'No mistake at all, sir; no mistake at all. I guess
his brother would know if any body did.'</p>

<!-- page 230 -->

<p>" 'You are sure, then, that there is no mistake?' I
questioned, looking him full in the eye.</p>

<p>" 'Quite sure,' was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>" 'Well,' said I, 'this is the strangest thing that I
ever heard. I parted with my wife this morning with
perfect good feeling between us; and I never had a
brother.'</p>

<p>" 'You!' exclaimed the deacon, starting to his feet.</p>

<p>" 'Yes, sir: my name is Porter, and it is my wife
of whom you have been talking.' Indeed, Alice, you
would have laughed, could you have seen the consternation
depicted upon the man's countenance."</p>

<p>The landlady now remarked that a Mrs. Porter, living
near there, had recently left her husband, and that
was probably the one intended.</p>

<p>"Was she a Spiritualist?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"She was not, or, if so, had never made it public."</p>

<p>"Why, then, do people couple it with Spiritualism?
why must I bear the blame of her acts?"</p>

<p>"Because, madam, Spiritualism has that tendency.
It is a part of their teachings, and the people know it,"
was the positive answer.</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard them teach such things?"
asked Miss Holstien.</p>

<p>"I never go after such teachers: we are commanded
to 'go not after them,' " was her reply; "but I
can tell you of a case that occurred in the neighborhood
where I lived before I came here, which shows
plainly enough what the tendency is. Still, I do not
mean to say that there are no good people among them,"
she added, seeming for the first time to remember that
she was talking to Spiritualists.</p>

<!-- page 231 -->

<p>"Please tell us of the facts in the case referred to,"
said Alice.</p>

<p>Thus interrogated, the lady said, "About two years
since, a woman came into our neighborhood, and commenced
lecturing on Spiritualism. She was quite popular
with the people: no fault could be found with what
she said, for she denounced evil in every form. Weeks
passed; and there was hardly a village within fifty miles,
up and down the river, where she had not spoken one
or more times; and, at length, she came close to
our place, and stopped with a family by the name of
Stintson. She staid there about a week, I think it was,
and then went to a little town some fifteen miles away,
to give a course of lectures.</p>

<p>"And now comes the sequel to all her fine talk.
Some ten days afterward, Stintson got angry about some
trifle, and declared that he would not stay with his family
any longer; ordered his carriage, drove directly
to where this woman was staying, and, taking her with
him, went some forty miles up the river; was gone
three nights, and then returned, bringing with him another
of their speakers to help make peace again at
home."</p>

<p>"Was the last-named speaker a woman?" asked
Porter.</p>

<p>"No; but his wife was with him, and report says
that he had forsaken his own family for her."</p>

<p>"Never mind what report says," remarked Miss
Holstien: "did they succeed in their mission of
peace?"</p>

<p>"It was thought that they had for a while: but it seems
that he was not sincere; for, after a few months,&mdash;after

<!-- page 232 -->

a sufficient length of time to enable him to put his
business into good shape,&mdash;then he left, and it is supposed
that they are together somewhere."</p>

<p>"I think," said Miss Holstien, "that what report
says, and 'it is supposed,' should be left out of the question
entirely. It would certainly be more in accord
with the sweet spirit of charity, as neither of the above
statements is true."</p>

<p>Alice and Porter looked up in surprise; while the
woman, who had been so positive in her assertions,
asked, with an evident trepidation in her voice, "Are
you acquainted with the parties?"</p>

<p>"With one of them intimately, and with the others
slightly," was her reply. "I have known that speaker
for years; and she would sooner sever her right arm
from her body than to take another woman's husband
from her."</p>

<p>"How, then, do you account for the facts in the
case?"</p>

<p>"Madam, you have not given the facts,&mdash;only a
very distorted version of them."</p>

<p>"Will you please give the correct version, miss?"
said the lady with a sneer.</p>

<p>"I can," was the firm response; "but, first, let me
say, that any man who would leave his family as you
have represented this one's doing&mdash;that is, with no
provocation but his own fancy&mdash;is just no man at all,
is worth no woman's attention. Secondly, the woman
of whom you say, 'It is supposed that she is with him,'
knows no more of his whereabouts than if she had never
seen him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will inform me how you know these
things?" asked the lady.</p>

<!-- page 233 -->

<p>"I will; for I am that woman, and ought to know
the facts in the case."</p>

<p>Porter and his wife were somewhat surprised at this
announcement, and so amused that they could hardly
restrain their mirth; but the landlady's confusion was
pitiable to behold. She tried to apologize, but was prevented
by Miss Holstien's saying, "Only listen to my
statements, and be as faithful in reporting them as you
have those of the other side, and it is all I ask.</p>

<p>"When I was at Mr. Stintson's, I had not the most
distant idea that there was the least trouble between him
and his wife, or ever had been. True, there was one
thing that annoyed me somewhat; and that was this: I
had one appointment, some seven miles distant, to which
he took me, neither his wife nor daughter accompanying
us. But, as they had attended my other lectures, I
accepted their reasons for not going as sufficient, and
put my unpleasant feelings aside.</p>

<p>"When I left there, I did not know certainly that I
should visit the place from whence he took me at the
time you tell me that the public inferred so much; and
as I had held no communication with him, if he knew
that I was there, which he said he did not, he learned
it from some other source. I had finished my engagement,
and was to go that day to another point; the
gentleman who was to take me being already in town.</p>

<p>"I was nearly ready to start when he came in,
bringing Mr. Stintson with him. 'I have but a moment
to stop,' said Stintson; 'for I must go to Elder
Whitney's to-night; but, learning that you were here, I
thought I would call.'</p>

<p>" 'Going up to the Elder's?' said I. 'If I had no appointment

<!-- page 234 -->

out, I would go with you, if you would take
me; for I have promised them that I will visit them before
I leave this part of the country, and I can not get
within six or seven miles of there by public conveyance.'</p>

<p>" 'I can take you just as well as not if you wish to
go,' was his reply; 'but you will not have much time
to visit, as I am going on purpose to bring them back
with me; for their signatures are necessary to complete
a business transaction that I have on hand.'</p>

<p>" 'But I can not go,' said I, 'as I have an appointment
to fill to-night.'</p>

<p>"The other gentleman then said that he would withdraw
that appointment for me, and I could fill it when
I returned.</p>

<p>" 'I do not know as I shall return this way at all,'
I replied; 'for, when I go, I have business at M&mdash;&mdash;,
a hundred miles farther north, and I may wish to go
east from there.'</p>

<p>" 'If that is the case,' said he, 'you had better go
now: for speakers are not any too well paid; and, if
you go that far with Mr. Stintson, it will save you as
much in stage-fare as you would get to-night.'</p>

<p>" 'How soon can you be ready?' asked Mr. Stintson.</p>

<p>" 'In ten minutes,' I replied; 'for I was nearly ready
to start for the grove when you came in.'</p>

<p>" 'Well,' said he, 'I can wait that long; for I must
call at Wilson's store a moment before I can start.'</p>

<p>"And that is how I came to take that ride with Mr.
Stintson. We had gone several miles, chatting as we
went, upon various subjects, when he turned to me, and
said,&mdash;</p>

<!-- page 235 -->

<p>" 'You will be surprised when I tell you that I am
arranging business to leave my family.'</p>

<p>" 'Leave your family!' said I.</p>

<p>" 'Yes: there has been no peace for me there for
years; but pride has kept the trouble hidden. I can
bear it no longer, and will not. I shall leave the farm
to them, take what ready money I have and my horses,
and go where I shall not be found fault with all the
time.'</p>

<p>" 'Mr. Stintson,' said I, 'had I had the most distant
idea of this, I would not have come one step with you;
for do you know that I shall have to bear the blame of
this?'</p>

<p>" 'I did not think of that,' he replied, 'or I would
have made some excuse for not bringing you; but it is
too late now. Still, I do not see how they can lay the
blame upon you: you have had nothing to do in the
matter.'</p>

<p>" 'True,' I replied: 'but the public can not know that;
and, if you persist in leaving your family now, you will
do me an irreparable wrong. Were I a Methodist or a
Presbyterian, it would be different; but people are watching
Spiritualists, expecting, hoping, to see them stumble,
and, with the least excuse for believing evil of them, they
are certain to do so.' When we reached the Elder's,
the matter was talked over again; and both he and his
wife joined with me in entreating Stintson to stay with
his family, but with what result I never knew. I have
seen none of them since; and, the Elder moving away
shortly after, I lost their address, consequently could not
write to them.</p>

<p>"I did not wish to write to others about it, as I did

<!-- page 236 -->

not know but the trouble was so settled that other parties
knew nothing of it. I hoped that it was."</p>

<p>"How happened it, Miss Holstien, that Mr. Stintson
was gone three nights, when, according to your statement,
there was no necessity for his being absent but
one."</p>

<p>"I am not Mr. Stintson's keeper, madam, and can
not, therefore, be held responsible for his acts; but I can
tell you what I know upon the subject. I staid at the
Elder's only one night. But I heard him tell Mr. Stintson
that they could not possibly leave before Saturday;
and Mr. Stintson replied, 'I shall not go home till you
and your wife go with me, if I have to stay a week.'
This was on Thursday; and, if he waited till Saturday,
he would have to stay two nights longer."</p>

<p>"Strange, isn't it?" said Porter, "upon what a small
foundation a four-story report can be raised."</p>

<p>"And stranger still," added Alice, "that each addition
upward can increase in size, and still the structure remain
firm."</p>

<p>"And do you intend to say that all the cases reported
of Spiritualism's breaking up families can be explained
as readily, have as little foundation in truth, as these
have?" asked the landlady.</p>

<p>"I do not," replied Miss Holstien; "but I do say, that,
as far as my observation goes, it can be said of at least
two out of every three; and if you will take cases of
this kind that occur in the church, and multiply them
by three, I think the number thus attained would startle
the most unthinking."</p>

<p>"You will acknowledge that divorces are more common
now than formerly, I presume."</p>

<!-- page 237 -->

<p>"That may be true. I think it is; indeed, I know
it, though I have not examined the statistics on this
point: and there is a cause for it that surface thinkers
do not perceive; and, not knowing what else to say,
they attribute it to the influence of Spiritualism."</p>

<p>"How do you account for it, Miss Holstien?"</p>

<p>"In the same manner that I account for the swelling
of the buds in spring-time. There is a new life, the
vital tides of an increased growth, flowing through the
veins of humanity; and the old channels are too circumscribed
for its expression. The old conservative condition,
like the bark upon the tree, resists this tendency to
expansion, until it becomes so strong that it forces itself
through the very walls of its prison to reach the light.</p>

<p>"It is true of the human, as of the vegetable, that
many a promising bud, many a beautiful blossom, will
blast, will come to naught, under the influence of wind,
storm, or unseasonable frosts. And it is equally true
that the tree of humanity will never give us the leaves
that are for the healing of the nations till woman holds
a place in society where she is not subject to man, till
she stands before the law as his equal, with equal rights
as a citizen. Man may continue to be the bark, the
inclosing rind, protecting the body of the tree from destruction;
but when he asserts the same power over the
buds and blossoms in the time of their appearance, will
not give them an equal right with himself to sunlight
and air, his claims are certain to be disputed, and not
only disputed, but set aside."</p>

<p>"Woman's rights, I perceive."</p>

<p>"Not woman's rights, madam, but human rights; for
the rights of one portion of the race can not be violated
without wrong to each and all."</p>

<!-- page 238 -->

<p>"You believe, then,&mdash;you Spiritualists,&mdash;that man and
wife have the right to separate if they can not agree."</p>

<p>"Can not agree and will not agree are two different
things entirely: and, if it was only among Spiritualists
that this state of things existed, there might be some
show of justice in your accusations; but you have only
to look at society to find this spirit pervading all its
ranks. A friend of mine once examined the records of
his county to learn how many of the divorces granted
were to parties known to be Spiritualists; and, of eighty,
there were only four of this class."</p>

<p>"Well," said Porter, taking out his watch, "it's my
honest opinion that there is not so much difference between
Jew and Gentile, after all; and I see that it is
nearly train-time. Miss Holstien, if you will go home
with us, I will try and not run away with you."</p>

<p>"No need for that, Mr. Porter," was her playful reply;
"for, as your wife has left you for another, you are
entitled to a divorce."</p>

<p>"True, true: I did not think of that. Come, then,
we will go; and Mrs. Porter can follow on, repentant,
or go and find her other man;" and, catching Miss Holstien
by the arm, he hurried her out of the house. But
Alice was too quick for him; and, before he could close
the door between them, she was hanging upon his other
arm.</p>

<p>"Oh, these old wives! it is impossible to get clear of
them," said he, looking at her with an expression of
tenderness that belied the light raillery of his words.</p>

<p>"Free lovers," said the landlady, looking after them
with a sneering expression upon her otherwise fine
features. But her distrust could not penetrate the

<!-- page 239 -->

armor of their conscious rectitude. It stung only herself;
for while they, seated in the cars that were
bearing them swiftly to their destination, chatted away
the hour that intervened, with joy in the present and
high hopes for the future, she went about sighing, as
she dwelt upon the dark shades of the picture formed
by her own imagination.</p>

<p>A FEW days after the occurrence above
related, Alice was surprised by a visit
from her uncle. He was evidently much
embarrassed; for they had not met till
now, since the time that he had so cruelly
deceived and betrayed her into the hands of Dr. Denning.
The doctor and his wife, as I have already
stated, had investigated the facts and philosophy of
Spiritualism, till, like Paul of old, they were now the
zealous advocates of that which they had once so
strenuously opposed.</p>

<p>James Vale and his wife had learned this, the indirect
result of the course they had taken in incarcerating
Alice; and this, together with other influences brought
to bear upon them from time to time, had set them to
questioning also. But, though losing faith in the old
forms of thought, they were not prepared, as yet, to
accept the new. They longed to recognize therein all
that was claimed by its advocates, but found many
things to stagger them, even at the very threshold.</p>

<p>There was a recklessness of speech and manner,
a carelessness as to life-conduct, in many of its warmest
defenders, which, it seemed to them, illy comported with

<!-- page 241 -->

the claim of holding communion with the angels.
And there were many other things which made them,
and especially Mrs. Vale, fear to walk in what might
prove to be a forbidden path. While talking this
matter over one evening Mr. Vale said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am going to see Alice, wife. She can explain
these things if any one can; and, as to the wrong, you
will never find her doing or advocating that which she
believes to be such."</p>

<p>"But belief, my dear, can not change the character
of an act, as you well know," replied Mrs. Vale.</p>

<p>"That may be, so far as the act itself is concerned;
that is, the results of the act as it regards physical well-being,
or otherwise: but the moral character of any
and every act is certainly determined by the motive.
In reference to Alice, her experience in this matter is
certainly greater than my own, and she ought to be able
to give me some light on the subject. Still, though I
may think it wise to question her, she must convince
my judgment before I shall accept her conclusions. So,
little wife, never fear for me; for I certainly shall not go
it blind."</p>

<p>"No, husband: I think you would be more likely to
shut your eyes against the light, than to consent to walk
where there was none, judging from past experience.
However, if you wish to visit Alice, I have no objection;
but how do you suppose she will receive you after what
has passed?"</p>

<p>"Like her own self. If she holds hardness toward
me, I shall know that her new theories have made her
worse, instead of better, and shall, of course, have
nothing further to do in that direction."</p>

<!-- page 242 -->

<p>Alice was very much surprised; but she met him
cordially, never once showing, by either look or manner,
that she felt a shade of unkind feeling toward him on
account of the past. Indeed, she did not feel any,&mdash;neither
against him nor those who had acted in concert
with him; for she realized most fully that they knew
not what they did.</p>

<p>Porter was differently constituted, and could not <i>feel</i>
just as Alice did. There was a little bitterness in his
heart, as he thought of the past; but for her sake he
did not show it: consequently, the proud spirit of
James Vale was even more chafed by the reception he
met, than if a portion of that which he felt he deserved
had been meted out to him. Nevertheless, he had
come for a purpose, and he intended to accomplish it:
so, when the evening meal was over, he turned to Alice,
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have come here, Alice, to question you about your
Spiritualism?"</p>

<p>"Very well, uncle," she replied: "proceed with
your questioning, and I will answer to the best of my
ability."</p>

<p>"Well, then, in the first place, I wish to know why
so many d&mdash;&mdash;d fools and d&mdash;&mdash;d knaves are attracted
to it?"</p>

<p>Alice smiled: "Why do patients whose diseases are
the most virulent, or whose lungs are the nearest consumed,&mdash;why
do such always go to the most noted
physicians, uncle?"</p>

<p>"Sharp as ever, you little Yankee: we are not talking
of hospitals."</p>

<p>"Not of hospitals, but of one great moral hospital,

<!-- page 243 -->

such as society is, and will be till thoroughly renovated.
And it is to this end that the true physician directs his
attention,&mdash;to the removing of the causes of disease
more than to dealing with effects. Wherever the
best physician is, there will the sick congregate in the
greatest numbers. This is as true morally as it is
physically."</p>

<p>"So you think that Spiritualism is a better physician
than the religion of Jesus?"</p>

<p>"I believe that Spiritualism proper is the religion of
Jesus; and not only his, but of all the lovers of the
race who have had a zeal according to knowledge."</p>

<p>"Spiritualism proper?"</p>

<p>"Yes: when accumulated snows have been melted
by the warmth of the sun in spring-time, or when
heavy rains have fallen, thus swelling the body of a
stream to treble its size, you certainly would not call the
driftwood, or the soil that is thus dislodged and carried
forward, making the crystal waters turbid with the mixture,&mdash;you
would not call this, these foreign ingredients,
a portion of the stream proper, would you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not; and the same can be said of the
Christian religion."</p>

<p>"True, most true, uncle: therefore I say that Spiritualism
proper and the religion of Jesus are the same.
But what is called the religion of Jesus is a far different
thing. The idea of three Gods in one, vicarious atonement,
an eternal hell, &amp;c., did not originate with him,
are no part of his religion. These were all taken from
heathen mythology,&mdash;were extant long before his advent
upon earth, therefore can not be called his in any
especial sense."</p>

<!-- page 244 -->

<p>"What, then, do you recognize as the distinguishing
feature of his teachings?"</p>

<p>"The pre-eminent value of man; God pledged to
the welfare of man, and not man sacrificed to God;
the sabbath for man, and not man for the sabbath;
and, carrying out the same principle, the Bible for man,
and not man for the Bible: in a word, that man is the
lord and master, and all things his servants, his tools
with which he is to work out his own salvation."</p>

<p>"But suppose he cuts his fingers with these tools:
what then?"</p>

<p>"Which he is pretty sure to do till he learns to use
them skillfully: he must bear the smart, and learn the
lesson intended."</p>

<p>"All this is very well, Alice; but somehow you have
led me from the track,&mdash;have so covered up the knavery
and folly of professed Spiritualists under the mantle
of general principles, that I had forgotten the main
question."</p>

<p>"I have not intended this, uncle: let us come back
to the point, then."</p>

<p>"Well, to state my first question more definitely, why
do so many Spiritualists swear, lie, break the sabbath,
&amp;c.? Why are they so reckless of sacred things?"</p>

<p>"To be reckless of sacred things, and to disregard
what some one else considers as such, are two things
entirely; and, as to swearing, lying, and the like, I suppose
those who do such things, do them because they
like to."</p>

<p>"Because they like to!"</p>

<p>"Yes: if a person really desires to do an act, he is
in the moral condition indicated by the status of that
act, whether he performs it or not."</p>

<!-- page 245 -->

<p>"Then you would have people do just what they
want to?"</p>

<p>"I would have people do right from a love of the
right."</p>

<p>"But suppose they do not love the right?"</p>

<p>"Then they can not do the right, in any true sense
of that term; but they will love the right if properly
instructed."</p>

<p>"How do you show that, Alice?"</p>

<p>"From an axiom that is as true of morals as are the
axioms of mathematics. Do not men and women, if
left unrestrained, always take the course that seemeth
to them best?"</p>

<p>"Well, I really don't know but they do; but they
make some awful mistakes."</p>

<p>"Yes; and so do children in following out their own
inclinations. Sometimes it is best to restrain them, and
sometimes it is better to let them have their own way
for the sake of the lesson. Still, in each case, the principle
is the same: both desire happiness; both are ignorant
of the mode of obtaining it."</p>

<p>"I don't see what that has to do with the love of
right."</p>

<p>"Do you believe it possible for human beings to desire
their own misery?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not,&mdash;that is, misery for its own sake:
though they may desire it for the sake of the happiness
that may accrue from the results."</p>

<p>"True; but it is the happiness that is <i>desired</i>, while
the misery is only <i>endured</i>. This proves that self-love
is the broad foundation upon which the structure of
universal love must be reared. This is the foundation

<!-- page 246 -->

that is already laid in the very nature of things, and
man has no power to remove it, no power to put another
in its place. Thus, you see, my dear uncle, that, as it is
impossible for a man to desire his own misery, so must
he naturally love that which will secure his happiness,
just as fast as he realizes what it is. But he must realize
this for himself, and not another for him."</p>

<p>"You mean to say, then, that he will love the right
just as soon as he truly learns that only through the
right can such happiness as the soul seeks be his?"</p>

<p>"I do, uncle; and not only this: he can no more
help loving it than two and two can help being four
when placed together."</p>

<p>"Why, then, if man's sins are the result of ignorance,
does God punish him for committing them?"</p>

<p>"He does not: man punishes; God teaches."</p>

<p>"Very emphatic teaching, I should think,&mdash;some of
it at least."</p>

<p>"True; but if the burning of a finger so teaches us
the nature of fire, that we, by that means, are able to
save the whole hand, is not the lesson a cheap one?"</p>

<p>"That may be true; but I tell you, Alice, I believe
that Spiritualism makes people worse instead of better.
I have known good church-members, men who had the
confidence of all who knew them,&mdash;I have known such
become Spiritualists, and then become reckless; families
broken up, wives forsaken, and home ruined generally.
Now, if these things are not the result of Spiritualism,
why did they not occur before such individuals came
under the influence of its teachings?"</p>

<p>"Because of fear. People often desire to do things
that they dare not perform."</p>

<!-- page 247 -->

<p>"Is it not better that we should be restrained by fear
than not at all?"</p>

<p>"For our external interest, yes; for our spiritual
good, no."</p>

<p>"How do you show that?"</p>

<p>"From the fact, that, so long as one desires to do a
thing, he believes that it is good for him, that it will
conduce to his happiness; and, till he learns the reverse,
he can not cease to desire it. This being true, it is better
for him to learn it from experience than not at all."</p>

<p>"And what is the harm if he never learns it?"</p>

<p>"No harm, only that there is a bar across the pathway
of progress which he will never get over."</p>

<p>"I should call that doing evil that good may come."</p>

<p>"And I should call it rooting out the evil that good
may take its place. Is not the latter the most reasonable
version of the point at issue, uncle?"</p>

<p>"You may be right, Alice; but it seems to me that
this would be a strange world if everybody did just
what they wanted to."</p>

<p>"And how much worse would you be, uncle?"</p>

<p>"A good way, that, to find out just what your uncle
would like to do, puss."</p>

<p>"Isn't it, though? Would you like to steal, uncle?"</p>

<p>"No, Alice: I never felt the least desire to steal."</p>

<p>"Then you have no occasion to learn better. Would
you like to break the marriage covenant by sleeping with
your neighbor's wife?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed: I should scorn to do such an act."</p>

<p>"Do you think you would like to do these things if
you should become a Spiritualist?"</p>

<p>"Not I: if becoming a Spiritualist involved the love
of these things, I should never be one."</p>

<!-- page 248 -->

<p>"But suppose, uncle, that you did desire to do these
things, and believed that Spiritualism sanctioned them:
what then?"</p>

<p>"I should be very likely to advocate its teachings."</p>

<p>"Advocate what you supposed to be its teachings,
you mean."</p>

<p>"Well, what I supposed to be its teachings."</p>

<p>"Can you not see, then, how others who do desire to
do the things that you repudiate,&mdash;can you not see how
they might mistake the freedom to burn their fingers if
they wished&mdash;or, in other words, the privilege of learning
the evil of these things for themselves,&mdash;as a sanction
of the wrong?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I can, Alice; but I never looked at it in
that light before."</p>

<p>"And do you not know that those who expect to receive
the greatest benefit from any given thing will, in
accordance with the law of self-love, be its most earnest
advocates?"</p>

<p>"You do not mean to say that the most earnest advocates
of Spiritualism are all of this class?"</p>

<p>"No, uncle; for there are those who so understand the
real principles thereof, that they can not help but advocate
it with earnestness. But there are those who are
loud in its advocacy, only because they believe that it
gives them license. When such learn, through experience,
that every indulgence has its price,&mdash;a price
that must be paid in suffering, even to the utmost farthing,&mdash;then
they will either forsake the ranks of
Spiritualism, or they will advocate it from far different
motives. In a word, Spiritualism is the religion of manhood,&mdash;a
religion that teaches to walk in one's own

<!-- page 249 -->

strength, instead of being carried like babes in the arms
of a nurse: and, if babies rush into its ranks, they must
necessarily stumble; but, in doing so, they will eventually
learn to walk, even if they should have to go
back to the arms of the nurse for a while."</p>

<p>"But all this refers to the philosophy, to the moral
bearings, of Spiritualism: what of its mediums, of the
law of communication?"</p>

<p>"Did you ever see an individual acting as interpreter
between two persons of different nationalities, uncle?"</p>

<p>"I never happened to witness such a thing, as I recollect;
but then I know that it is often done."</p>

<p>"In order to do this, the one interpreting must understand
both languages."</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly."</p>

<p>"Do you not know that no one is able, till they have
learned, to understand even one language, much less
two?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course I do: what is the use of all these
foolish questions, Alice?"</p>

<p>"Wait and see. Do you not know that some persons
are, from birth, more disposed to the acquisition of one
kind of knowledge, and some to another; for instance,
some learn to sing and play with the utmost ease, and
others take as naturally to mathematics?"</p>

<p>"It is too evident to be questioned."</p>

<p>"Then those whose natural forte was language would
make the best interpreters, the best mediums of communication
between two individuals of different languages:
would they not?"</p>

<p>"Self-evident truth, that even a child could understand."</p>

<!-- page 250 -->

<p>"Well, uncle, mediumship, the law of communication
between two worlds, two states of existence, is just
as natural as are the laws which govern the above self-evident
truths, as you call them. This law must be
learned, and the conditions complied with in one case
as well as in the other; and there are individuals whose
particular forte, power, gift, or whatever you may
choose to call it, lies in this direction, as well as those
who are natural musicians, mechanics, &amp;c. Such persons
are called mediums."</p>

<p>"This may be true. If so, it seems to me that mediums
should be very good, much better than other
people; and yet the evidence is right the reverse."</p>

<p>"How? worse than others?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me so, Alice."</p>

<p>"Have you been personally acquainted with many?"</p>

<p>"No: I have never talked with any but yourself and
one other."</p>

<p>"Have judged from common report, then. Fie, fie,
uncle! I thought you had better sense than that."</p>

<p>"But has common report no foundation?"</p>

<p>"I suppose that it has two strong pillars: the first
is the claim which you have already made, that they
should be better than others; and the other rests on the
fact that they do many things which do not properly
belong to them as individuals, they being simply the
channels through which others act."</p>

<p>"But why should they not be better than others?
It seems to me, that, if I could talk with angels, I would
never do any thing wrong."</p>

<p>"Why, then, do wrong now? You talk with angels
every day."</p>

<p>"I!"</p>

<!-- page 251 -->

<p>"Yes, uncle: what is it that leaves the body at
death?"</p>

<p>"The spirit, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Could a spirit leave the body if it were not in the
body?"</p>

<p>"Of course not; but I see what you are aiming at:
you mean to say that it is spirits who have left the body
that mediums talk with, and spirits who are still in the
body that we talk with; and, if we call one class angels,
the other class must be angels too."</p>

<p>"Well, is not the claim a just one?"</p>

<p>"I do not know but it is; still, we have not been
accustomed to looking at things in this light, and it is
hard to realize that it is so."</p>

<p>"True, uncle: we have been in the habit of using a
mental magnifying glass when thinking of those who
have left this state of existence; consequently they have
appeared to us much more than they really are. But,
even if our estimate of them was correct, it would not
follow that those who could communicate with them, or
be controlled by them, would necessarily be better than
others. If a beggar should bear a message from a farmer
to a judge, it would not have the least tendency to
make him either one or the other; neither would it tend
to make a truthful man of a liar, should one who was
truthful employ him to carry a letter to another of the
same character."</p>

<p>"I see, I see, Alice; but does not mediumship itself
tend to degrade the individual, from the very fact of
their negative condition? You yourself have admitted
that they do many things that do not properly belong to
them as individuals."</p>

<!-- page 252 -->

<p>"If conditions are not right, it may have that tendency;
but what shall we do in the case?&mdash;ignore the
fact of mediumship, turn our back upon those who are
such, and leave them to sink in the mire if they will?"</p>

<p>"I think, if I were a medium, Alice, I would give it
up,&mdash;would have nothing to do with it whatever."</p>

<p>"And if you were a sponge, uncle, you would not be
a sponge, lest you might sometime fell into muddy
water, and thus absorb its filth."</p>

<p>"Nonsense: what becomes of our free agency in
that case; that is, if your illustration is a good one?"</p>

<p>"What becomes of your free agency in the color
of your eyes or hair, in your height, sex, or the color of
your skin? You may dye your hair; but it will grow
out again, the same color as before. You may dress in
woman's clothes, but you will be a man still. And so on
through the list: nature will assert herself in spite of
you. It is the same of mediumship: it is a physiological
condition, over which you may have a partial, a temporary
control; but, in spite of it all, you are a medium
still."</p>

<p>"Have mediums, then, no individuality?"</p>

<p>"They have. Place a sponge in milk, and it will
absorb milk; but it is a sponge still, and the milk absorbed
is no part of it: and thus of every substance,
capable of being absorbed, in which you may place it.
A sponge is one of the connecting links between the
vegetable and the animal kingdom. If you place it in
connection with a liquid vegetable substance, it absorbs
it; if in connection with a liquid animal substance, it will
do the same. Mediums are the connecting links
between those who live in the material world and those

<!-- page 253 -->

who live in the spirit world; and they also have their
distinct individuality."</p>

<p>"Who, then, shall judge them?"</p>

<p>"The God within their own souls: none other need
attempt it, and expect to judge righteous judgment.
And this is as true of others as of mediums. Still, it is
a hard lesson for humanity to learn; for, measuring
others by ourselves, we are too apt to blame if they
dare to differ from us, and especially if it is upon
points that we deem of vital importance. The words
of Pope,&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">"Let not this weak, this erring hand<br/>

Presume thy bolts to throw,"&mdash;</p>

<p>And those other words spoken by Jesus so long before,
'Judge not, that ye be not judged,'&mdash;these need to
take deep root in every heart, and must, before we can
exercise that 'charity' which 'suffereth long, and is
kind.' "</p>

<p>"Well, Alice, I do not see as there is much use in
talking with you, as one can not get the advantage of
you: you will make your side smooth all the time," said
Mr. Vale, laughing.</p>

<p>"And did you wish to get the advantage of me,
uncle?"</p>

<p>"No: I don't know as I did; still, I did not think
you would always have so ready an answer. But you
have not satisfied me upon every point: I think I will
go to bed, and study the matter over a little."</p>

<p>"Better go to sleep, uncle, for I know that you are
tired; and, if you expect me or any one else to satisfy
you on every point, you will find yourself mistaken.
The soul must answer its own questioning."</p>

<!-- page 254 -->

<p>"Must answer its own questioning! what do you
mean by that?"</p>

<p>"Simply this: another may throw light upon our
path; but we must travel it for ourselves, if we would
know to a certainty what lies at the end of it."</p>

<p>"What a puss you are! you are as ready at comparisons
as a cat is at catching mice; but do you ever
doubt and question, Alice?"</p>

<p>"Often, often, uncle. The problems of life call me
out in this direction continually; so much so that I
sometimes agonize for the solution."</p>

<p>"And you expect to find the solution at last?"</p>

<p>"Sooner or later, I shall."</p>

<p>"What do you intend to do then?"</p>

<p>"Use them as a torch to light the pathway of others,
these that I solve while here; and those that I can not
solve till I leave the body, I hope to find some medium
to use them for me."</p>

<p>"I hope you will if there is any truth in this matter;
but I shall need a somewhat different torch to light me
to bed,&mdash;material light for material persons like
myself."</p>

<p>"Will this lamp answer your purpose, uncle?"</p>

<p>"Capitally, puss."</p>

<p>"What! just as it is?" said Alice, looking up with a
merry twinkle in her eye.</p>

<p>"No, you rogue: it must be lighted, of course."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"With a match, I presume: that is what I generally
use."</p>

<p>"And they must be ignited by friction?"</p>

<p>"That is the rule, I believe; that is, when there is
no fire within reach to touch them to."</p>

<!-- page 255 -->

<p>"And even then the brimstone must be burned off
before they are of any use."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; but what sage application do you intend
to make of that fact?"</p>

<p>"Simply this, uncle: when the friction of life has
taken you beyond the brimstone of past teachings, the
lamp of your soul will burn so clearly that you will not
need to say 'if there is any truth in this matter;' for
you will know for yourself that there is."</p>

<p>"God speed the time, and good-night," said he, as he
disappeared up the stairway, and Alice was left to her
own reflections. Porter had been busy with some
writing, and had taken no part in the conversation,
though he had heard a portion of it. Putting aside his
work soon after Mr. Vale retired, he said, "Come
Alice, is it not most bedtime?"</p>

<p>Alice was sitting with her face buried in her hands,
and replied, "Don't wait for me: I am thinking."</p>

<p>"Solving problems?"</p>

<p>"Yes: trying to."</p>

<p>"I will leave you, then, to your own thoughts," said
he, as he retired; and, with your permission, kind
reader, we will do the same, for, rest assured, she is not
thinking for herself alone.</p>
